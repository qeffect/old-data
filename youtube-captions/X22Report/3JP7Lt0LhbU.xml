  <text start="170.379" dur="4.98">that in just a bit but first I wanted to</text>
  <text start="172.629" dur="4.651">start off with the economy now remember</text>
  <text start="175.359" dur="3.69">when we talking about the economy we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="177.28" dur="3.84">talking about two different economies</text>
  <text start="179.049" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re talking about the central bank</text>
  <text start="181.12" dur="4.56">economy which is failing and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="183.069" dur="4.741">talking about the new economy which is</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="3.6">being introduced that is Trump and the</text>
  <text start="187.81" dur="5.399">Patriots they&amp;#39;re introducing a new</text>
  <text start="189.28" dur="6.9">economy what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="193.209" dur="4.491">they&amp;#39;re using the manipulation that</text>
  <text start="196.18" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ve been using for many many years</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="5.17">against the central bankers against the</text>
  <text start="200.56" dur="3.599">deep state so when we talk about these</text>
  <text start="202.87" dur="3.42">numbers and all these statistical</text>
  <text start="204.159" dur="4.591">numbers remember it&amp;#39;s an illusion</text>
  <text start="206.29" dur="4.529">they&amp;#39;re doing this to counter the</text>
  <text start="208.75" dur="5.43">mainstream media the central bank</text>
  <text start="210.819" dur="7.441">argument that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="7.08">now buying time to transition us into a</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="6.959">new economy and using their weapons</text>
  <text start="221.26" dur="6.86">against them why not use all the free</text>
  <text start="225.219" dur="7.401">money you possibly can to rebuild</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="8.739">infrastructure to build your military</text>
  <text start="232.62" dur="7.509">build everything else and guess what</text>
  <text start="236.859" dur="4.951">what do you do later on you say hey we</text>
  <text start="240.129" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t have to pay this back and how do</text>
  <text start="241.81" dur="5.91">you accomplish this all you have to show</text>
  <text start="244.689" dur="5.04">is criminal activity in the Fed this is</text>
  <text start="247.72" dur="4.739">not part of their mandate their mandate</text>
  <text start="249.729" dur="6.75">was to here in the United States their</text>
  <text start="252.459" dur="6.661">mandate wasn&amp;#39;t to the world and to</text>
  <text start="256.479" dur="3.87">certain individuals and I believe this</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="3.479">is how they&amp;#39;re gonna get around this</text>
  <text start="260.349" dur="4.921">entire thing but what we&amp;#39;re seeing in</text>
  <text start="262.599" dur="5.401">the economy is that they&amp;#39;ve stopped</text>
  <text start="265.27" dur="4.649">raising the rates and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="268" dur="4.77">see some things level off in other</text>
  <text start="269.919" dur="5.941">things not so much but they need to do</text>
  <text start="272.77" dur="4.38">this long enough and if we look at home</text>
  <text start="275.86" dur="1.98">sales and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this for a</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="3.48">very long time</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="5.549">and you can see the pattern if you raise</text>
  <text start="280.63" dur="4.89">the interest rates right now what</text>
  <text start="283.389" dur="4.681">happens to the housing market it will</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="4.59">crash if you lower their interest rates</text>
  <text start="288.07" dur="5.279">what will happen to the housing market</text>
  <text start="290.11" dur="6.419">it will stay afloat it&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="293.349" dur="5.581">we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing the housing</text>
  <text start="296.529" dur="4.86">market it&amp;#39;s starting to stabilize</text>
  <text start="298.93" dur="4.11">not everywhere but in many places I mean</text>
  <text start="301.389" dur="3.81">we looked at pending home sales that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="303.04" dur="4.53">disaster as the existing home sales</text>
  <text start="305.199" dur="3.03">doesn&amp;#39;t look that great new home sales</text>
  <text start="307.57" dur="3.39">right now</text>
  <text start="308.229" dur="5.31">well they beat expectations how do they</text>
  <text start="310.96" dur="5.64">do this well they went back to January</text>
  <text start="313.539" dur="5.19">they revised some numbers we went from a</text>
  <text start="316.6" dur="4.2">negative six point nine percent month</text>
  <text start="318.729" dur="4.41">and month to an eight point two percent</text>
  <text start="320.8" dur="3.989">I mean it&amp;#39;s all about playing with the</text>
  <text start="323.139" dur="4.801">numbers trying to make everything look</text>
  <text start="324.789" dur="4.951">good and I do believe that there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="327.94" dur="3.75">to be problems in the housing markets</text>
  <text start="329.74" dur="5.489">still because I don&amp;#39;t think we stopped</text>
  <text start="331.69" dur="5.789">the interest rates soon enough from</text>
  <text start="335.229" dur="4.111">rising and I believe they&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="337.479" dur="5.211">to start to lower the interest rates to</text>
  <text start="339.34" dur="6.78">build activity to get the housing market</text>
  <text start="342.69" dur="5.89">you know moving again before the 2020</text>
  <text start="346.12" dur="5.729">election and this is what it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s about controlling the economy using</text>
  <text start="351.849" dur="6.211">the magic wand to make the economy look</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="7.56">fantastic and if you look you can see</text>
  <text start="358.06" dur="6.24">that the u.s. is the first country in</text>
  <text start="361.93" dur="6.989">the world history to increase GDP by</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="6.239">more than 1 trillion in a year now this</text>
  <text start="368.919" dur="4.68">is coming from the World Bank it</text>
  <text start="370.539" dur="5.011">reported for 2017 that the US was about</text>
  <text start="373.599" dur="4.471">25 percent of the total world GDP and</text>
  <text start="375.55" dur="5.369">around 80 trillion dollars the World</text>
  <text start="378.07" dur="6.45">Bank reported the u.s. at 19 trillion to</text>
  <text start="380.919" dur="9.571">China&amp;#39;s 12 Japan&amp;#39;s 5 Germany&amp;#39;s for a new</text>
  <text start="384.52" dur="9.389">case 3 now is this number real no</text>
  <text start="390.49" dur="6.149">because we know that they manipulate GDP</text>
  <text start="393.909" dur="4.561">numbers we know during Obama&amp;#39;s term they</text>
  <text start="396.639" dur="3.241">went all the way back to 1929 added</text>
  <text start="398.47" dur="3.78">research and development and recalculate</text>
  <text start="399.88" dur="4.11">everything up to the present day we know</text>
  <text start="402.25" dur="4.26">what Trump all of a sudden we had like a</text>
  <text start="403.99" dur="4.37">trillion dollar shipped and everything</text>
  <text start="406.51" dur="5.159">started to look really really great and</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="6.19">this is what they do nobody realizes</text>
  <text start="411.669" dur="4.981">that all this is happening but they do</text>
  <text start="414.55" dur="6.089">it so they can make the economy look</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="6.329">fantastic each president each individual</text>
  <text start="420.639" dur="4.261">the central bank they always have a plan</text>
  <text start="422.979" dur="3.99">make the economy look great but this</text>
  <text start="424.9" dur="4.56">person let this person bring it down</text>
  <text start="426.969" dur="4.741">they thought Obama was gonna make the</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="3.389">economy look great and with Trump they</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="3.81">were going to bring it down</text>
  <text start="432.849" dur="4.951">that&amp;#39;s not going to happen and many</text>
  <text start="435.52" dur="3.989">people don&amp;#39;t believe that this is what</text>
  <text start="437.8" dur="4.409">they were trying to do I know Q posted</text>
  <text start="439.509" dur="4.231">that the Fed is going to raise rates in</text>
  <text start="442.209" dur="4.08">2019 they&amp;#39;re going to try to bring the</text>
  <text start="443.74" dur="3.659">economy down and the Patriots were going</text>
  <text start="446.289" dur="4.31">to stop it and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="447.399" dur="7.5">Patriots have but when we look at this</text>
  <text start="450.599" dur="6.16">when Obama was present president seven</text>
  <text start="454.899" dur="5.121">of the eight years in office the Fed</text>
  <text start="456.759" dur="7.41">kept the interest rates at what zero</text>
  <text start="460.02" dur="7.359">once Trump was elected do you know the</text>
  <text start="464.169" dur="6.661">Fed increased rates eight times for a</text>
  <text start="467.379" dur="6.03">total of two percent what do you think</text>
  <text start="470.83" dur="6.78">they were playing to do hmm I wonder</text>
  <text start="473.409" dur="7.171">maybe crash the entire system absolutely</text>
  <text start="477.61" dur="6.679">but guess what the Patriots are in</text>
  <text start="480.58" dur="6">control and this is why the IMF the ECB</text>
  <text start="484.289" dur="4.72">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out what to do</text>
  <text start="486.58" dur="5.669">remember their whole plan was to raise</text>
  <text start="489.009" dur="6.42">rates with the Fed the Fed was going to</text>
  <text start="492.249" dur="3.81">start it off the ECB was going to join</text>
  <text start="495.429" dur="4.35">in later</text>
  <text start="496.059" dur="5.91">now the ECB is backtracking the IMF is</text>
  <text start="499.779" dur="5.331">out there they don&amp;#39;t know what to do</text>
  <text start="501.969" dur="6.81">they were vulnerable they&amp;#39;re exposed and</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="7.089">there&amp;#39;s a problem because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="508.779" dur="5.37">like everyone looking at them they like</text>
  <text start="512.199" dur="4.861">everyone looking at the event they like</text>
  <text start="514.149" dur="5.461">everyone looking at you know some other</text>
  <text start="517.06" dur="4.74">country they don&amp;#39;t want the people to</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="5.039">realize and understand what is really</text>
  <text start="521.8" dur="5.099">happening but we know that the</text>
  <text start="524.649" dur="7.44">intelligence organizations law but this</text>
  <text start="526.899" dur="8.641">is the deep state they like to create</text>
  <text start="532.089" dur="6.36">false Flags events and we know that</text>
  <text start="535.54" dur="5.34">their plan is to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="538.449" dur="4.58">because what other way do you make</text>
  <text start="540.88" dur="5.129">people really really angry</text>
  <text start="543.029" dur="7.841">besides explosions and things like that</text>
  <text start="546.009" dur="7.38">you hid them in their wallets you drain</text>
  <text start="550.87" dur="4.589">their bank accounts you get them very</text>
  <text start="553.389" dur="3.961">angry if the economy falls apart and</text>
  <text start="555.459" dur="3.961">they lose their investments they lose</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="5.19">their pension people become angry they</text>
  <text start="559.42" dur="7.26">want something to happen they want heads</text>
  <text start="562.54" dur="6.6">to roll and there&amp;#39;s a report right</text>
  <text start="566.68" dur="4.98">now which is issued by the US Government</text>
  <text start="569.14" dur="5.25">Accountability Office and it states that</text>
  <text start="571.66" dur="6.239">the Federal Reserve Bank their systems</text>
  <text start="574.39" dur="7.17">are exposed to an increased risk of</text>

  <text start="601.33" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s not a clear indication yet of</text>
  <text start="603.49" dur="3.48">what the vulnerability is it could be</text>
  <text start="605.44" dur="4.08">something as simple as maybe a bad</text>
  <text start="606.97" dur="6.63">password or the server needs to be</text>
  <text start="609.52" dur="8.009">updated it was done wrong or there is</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="7.47">malware on the system they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="617.529" dur="9.711">know they&amp;#39;re investigating this further</text>
  <text start="621.07" dur="9.75">and I&amp;#39;m wondering if the intelligence</text>
  <text start="627.24" dur="7.42">organizations the central banks they</text>
  <text start="630.82" dur="9.06">have planned this as a backup think</text>
  <text start="634.66" dur="7.38">about it for a second q told us that the</text>
  <text start="639.88" dur="6.12">central bank was going to raise rates</text>
  <text start="642.04" dur="7.02">throughout 2019 heading into 2020</text>
  <text start="646" dur="3.6">during 2019 the economy was going too</text>
  <text start="649.06" dur="3.149">slow</text>
  <text start="649.6" dur="5.429">things were going to break down it would</text>
  <text start="652.209" dur="4.411">give them at least a year maybe it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="655.029" dur="3.841">start in the middle of the year at least</text>
  <text start="656.62" dur="5.159">one year from the middle of 2019 to the</text>
  <text start="658.87" dur="5.339">middle of 2020 to blame it all on Trump</text>
  <text start="661.779" dur="5.281">to blame it on all his policies his</text>
  <text start="664.209" dur="5.221">tariffs his tax reduction all that stuff</text>
  <text start="667.06" dur="4.68">they would just blame him build it up</text>
  <text start="669.43" dur="5.52">until the elections and then bring down</text>
  <text start="671.74" dur="6.599">the economy right before the elections</text>
  <text start="674.95" dur="4.53">and what would that do most likely Trump</text>
  <text start="678.339" dur="2.161">would lose because people would be like</text>
  <text start="679.48" dur="3.359">oh my God look what he did to the</text>
  <text start="680.5" dur="5.579">economy I lost everything I lost my job</text>
  <text start="682.839" dur="5.701">it&amp;#39;s a complete and utter disaster we</text>
  <text start="686.079" dur="4.111">know that this economy is an illusion we</text>
  <text start="688.54" dur="3.989">know this had nothing to do with Trump</text>
  <text start="690.19" dur="3.99">we know that this economy was going to</text>
  <text start="692.529" dur="6.211">crash no matter what it was built on an</text>
  <text start="694.18" dur="6">illusion now since they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="698.74" dur="4.05">control of</text>
  <text start="700.18" dur="5.28">the Fed right now since they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="702.79" dur="4.43">control of the Fed raising rates because</text>
  <text start="705.46" dur="4.92">the Patriots are in control of this I</text>
  <text start="707.22" dur="8.13">wonder if there is some type of malware</text>
  <text start="710.38" dur="8.61">in this system that allows them to</text>
  <text start="715.35" dur="6.609">manipulate the system to make it look</text>
  <text start="718.99" dur="7.38">like someone on the outside gained</text>
  <text start="721.959" dur="7.651">access and did something which threw the</text>
  <text start="726.37" dur="6.42">entire economic system into a downward</text>
  <text start="729.61" dur="6.27">spiral I mean this is a possibility now</text>
  <text start="732.79" dur="5.34">the Patriots probably know about this or</text>
  <text start="735.88" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;ve been working on some type of</text>
  <text start="738.13" dur="6.36">method to stop it because they knew one</text>
  <text start="742.3" dur="6.18">of the plans I&amp;#39;m sure they knew the</text>
  <text start="744.49" dur="6.84">other plans and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="748.48" dur="6.15">very very odd this is very very strange</text>
  <text start="751.33" dur="6.36">and it&amp;#39;s something that we need to watch</text>
  <text start="754.63" dur="6.54">because we&amp;#39;ve known from the past that</text>
  <text start="757.69" dur="5.97">the CIA other intelligence organization</text>
  <text start="761.17" dur="4.23">is a deep state they planted malware in</text>
  <text start="763.66" dur="4.25">a lot of systems and all they have to do</text>
  <text start="765.4" dur="7.47">is activate it and the system goes down</text>
  <text start="767.91" dur="6.88">there full access to everything and we</text>
  <text start="772.87" dur="6.63">knew that eventually they were going to</text>
  <text start="774.79" dur="5.61">use this as a Hail Mary because look</text>
  <text start="779.5" dur="3.54">what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="780.4" dur="4.83">I mean we&amp;#39;re expecting the D class we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="783.04" dur="5.93">expecting the OIG report we&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="785.23" dur="6.51">everything so something might happen</text>
  <text start="788.97" dur="7.78">something might be planned maybe not for</text>
  <text start="791.74" dur="8.12">this year but it looks like there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="796.75" dur="6.72">type of vulnerability in the system that</text>
  <text start="799.86" dur="9.27">might have the ability to bring the</text>
  <text start="803.47" dur="9.45">economy down so hopefully the Patriots</text>
  <text start="809.13" dur="6.99">have recognized this and they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="812.92" dur="6.3">on it because they know all they see all</text>
  <text start="816.12" dur="6.01">but we have to remember the deep state</text>
  <text start="819.22" dur="6.6">the central banks they never give up</text>
  <text start="822.13" dur="6.54">trying because they want to be in</text>
  <text start="825.82" dur="4.019">control they don&amp;#39;t want the good guys in</text>
  <text start="828.67" dur="4.14">control they want to be in control</text>
  <text start="829.839" dur="4.171">because if they&amp;#39;re not in control all</text>
  <text start="832.81" dur="3.3">fingers will</text>
  <text start="834.01" dur="4.77">to them if all fingers are pointing to</text>
  <text start="836.11" dur="6.03">them people will realize who is</text>
  <text start="838.78" dur="5.43">responsible for all this and we will</text>
  <text start="842.14" dur="5.88">never allow a central bank in the</text>
  <text start="844.21" dur="5.91">country again now of course this has</text>
  <text start="848.02" dur="4.47">said many times before and we&amp;#39;re on our</text>
  <text start="850.12" dur="5.28">third central bank it does last for a</text>
  <text start="852.49" dur="5.13">little while until people forget but</text>
  <text start="855.4" dur="5.1">again we have to keep reminding people</text>
  <text start="857.62" dur="3.69">that we don&amp;#39;t want a central bank once</text>
  <text start="860.5" dur="3.15">we get rid of it</text>
  <text start="861.31" dur="4.86">and I do believe that we&amp;#39;re on the path</text>
  <text start="863.65" dur="4.95">right now to get rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="866.17" dur="5.31">in coordination with Russia China and</text>
  <text start="868.6" dur="4.41">other countries I think they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="871.48" dur="6.21">working on it together because they</text>
  <text start="873.01" dur="7.17">realize debt is not a good system it</text>
  <text start="877.69" dur="7.02">only hurts the country it only hurts the</text>
  <text start="880.18" dur="6.12">people it doesn&amp;#39;t help the people and I</text>
  <text start="884.71" dur="5.58">believe the world would be a better</text>
  <text start="886.3" dur="5.43">place without a central bank system and</text>
  <text start="890.29" dur="4.71">I should say a private western central</text>
  <text start="891.73" dur="5.04">bank system controlled by the Ross</text>
