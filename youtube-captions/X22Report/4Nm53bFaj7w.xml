  <text start="52.63" dur="6.68">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.32" dur="6.739">report my name is Dave in this episode</text>
  <text start="59.31" dur="7.21">1,513 bien today&amp;#39;s date is March 5th</text>
  <text start="63.059" dur="5.831">2018 and the title the episode is get</text>
  <text start="66.52" dur="4.86">ready for the deep state dead cat bounce</text>
  <text start="68.89" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s not what you think</text>
  <text start="71.38" dur="5.55">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="73.72" dur="6.24">political and geopolitical news now in</text>
  <text start="76.93" dur="7.58">the next couple of weeks maybe a month</text>
  <text start="79.96" dur="8.4">or two we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot happen and</text>
  <text start="84.51" dur="8.08">Q is referring to this as a dead cat</text>
  <text start="88.36" dur="6.56">bounce and this is not a good thing this</text>
  <text start="92.59" dur="4.889">is something that&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="94.92" dur="6.01">where the deep state is going to try</text>
  <text start="97.479" dur="6.811">something and this is going to be one of</text>
  <text start="100.93" dur="4.74">their last tries and if you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="104.29" dur="3.18">what a dead cat bounce is it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="105.67" dur="4.199">like when the stock market continually</text>
  <text start="107.47" dur="4.47">Falls and then all of a sudden it shoots</text>
  <text start="109.869" dur="5.101">up and everyone thinks everything is</text>
  <text start="111.94" dur="6">fine and then it crashes again the same</text>
  <text start="114.97" dur="4.92">thing is gonna happen here but it has</text>
  <text start="117.94" dur="4.44">nothing to do with the stock market it</text>
  <text start="119.89" dur="5.729">has to do with the deep state where they</text>
  <text start="122.38" dur="4.53">are going to try to do something it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="125.619" dur="3.121">going to shoot you know it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="126.91" dur="4.59">shoot up like they have the narrative</text>
  <text start="128.74" dur="4.29">and then it&amp;#39;s going to fail but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="131.5" dur="5.19">going to give it their all and their and</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="5.37">Q is saying right now that this is going</text>
  <text start="136.69" dur="4.02">to happen very very soon and we talked</text>
  <text start="138.4" dur="4.29">about events on how they can&amp;#39;t let this</text>
  <text start="140.71" dur="5.22">go and how they have to move forward and</text>
  <text start="142.69" dur="5.25">they have to regain the narrative and we</text>
  <text start="145.93" dur="3.69">can see that something is definitely on</text>
  <text start="147.94" dur="3.66">the horizon we&amp;#39;re gonna get to that in a</text>
  <text start="149.62" dur="4.68">little bit but first I wanted to start</text>
  <text start="151.6" dur="6.03">off with contradictions in the Seth Rich</text>
  <text start="154.3" dur="5.34">murder continue to challenge the hacking</text>
  <text start="157.63" dur="5.82">narrative now we know that Robert</text>
  <text start="159.64" dur="7.59">Mueller already indicted 13 Russians or</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="7.38">so about how they hacked the elections</text>
  <text start="167.23" dur="4.83">and we see right now there are rumors</text>
  <text start="170.83" dur="3.54">that are floating around saying that</text>
  <text start="172.06" dur="4.05">he&amp;#39;s preparing a case against Russians</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="4.91">who are alleged to have had hacked the</text>
  <text start="176.11" dur="5.94">Democrats during the 2016 election and</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="5.18">again this is coming out of the firm</text>
  <text start="182.05" dur="4.45">CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="184.46" dur="5.88">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="8.94">desperate attempt to push the narrative</text>
  <text start="190.34" dur="9">and to gain the narrative of what really</text>
  <text start="195.44" dur="7.44">happened here now kim.com as we know he</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="6.45">came out and he says he has an he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="202.88" dur="5.94">New Zealand entrepreneur he says he has</text>
  <text start="205.79" dur="6.9">evidence about who really you know took</text>
  <text start="208.82" dur="6.57">the information it was copied off it was</text>
  <text start="212.69" dur="6.72">Seth rich he obtained it the information</text>
  <text start="215.39" dur="6.48">using a memory stick they already proved</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="5.28">that you can&amp;#39;t copy the amount of data</text>
  <text start="221.87" dur="4.98">that quickly over the Internet and it</text>
  <text start="224.69" dur="5.16">had to be a memory stick and we see</text>
  <text start="226.85" dur="6.99">right now that Mueller is trying to make</text>
  <text start="229.85" dur="7.2">a connection of the 13 Russian hackers</text>
  <text start="233.84" dur="6.27">who tried to sway the elections which</text>
  <text start="237.05" dur="5.19">really didn&amp;#39;t happen at all this whole</text>
  <text start="240.11" dur="6.18">thing is made up there is no evidence</text>
  <text start="242.24" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s complete propaganda and he knows</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="3.69">that he&amp;#39;s never going to be able to</text>
  <text start="247.61" dur="5.04">bring the Russians over here to the</text>
  <text start="249.98" dur="5.04">United States to stand trial that is not</text>
  <text start="252.65" dur="4.23">going to happen and I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.02" dur="3.779">exactly what they want to do because if</text>
  <text start="256.88" dur="4.8">they did do that they would actually</text>
  <text start="258.799" dur="4.231">have to provide evidence which they</text>
  <text start="261.68" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t have and they&amp;#39;d have to prove a</text>
  <text start="263.03" dur="7.29">case which they can&amp;#39;t but I think the</text>
  <text start="265.73" dur="8.25">reason why they wanted to indict these</text>
  <text start="270.32" dur="7.79">individuals it&amp;#39;s because they wanted to</text>
  <text start="273.98" dur="8.79">link these hackers into the DNC and</text>
  <text start="278.11" dur="6.58">steer everyone away from Seth rich and I</text>
  <text start="282.77" dur="4.53">think this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="4.65">here and this is why Mueller most likely</text>
  <text start="287.3" dur="4.71">is going to come out with this story to</text>
  <text start="289.34" dur="4.56">say oh they are the ones according to</text>
  <text start="292.01" dur="5.16">CrowdStrike and other reports and things</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="6.81">like that that&amp;#39;s why the DNC was hacked</text>
  <text start="297.17" dur="5.76">it was done by these same exact thirteen</text>
  <text start="300.71" dur="5.4">Russians and we know that this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="302.93" dur="4.77">true we know that the FBI never went in</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="3.75">and looked at the servers never looked</text>
  <text start="307.7" dur="5.219">at anything and the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="4.05">complete prompt Buganda and it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="312.919" dur="5.341">done on purpose</text>
  <text start="313.91" dur="9">to gain the narrative now we need to</text>
  <text start="318.26" dur="8.1">then that they are running out of time</text>
  <text start="322.91" dur="5.37">and they&amp;#39;re trying to push whatever</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="4.92">agenda they possibly can right now to</text>
  <text start="328.28" dur="4.92">keep the narrative they don&amp;#39;t want an</text>
  <text start="331.28" dur="4.53">investigation they don&amp;#39;t want anything</text>
  <text start="333.2" dur="5.94">like this whatsoever now we need to pay</text>
  <text start="335.81" dur="6.42">close attention because Muller is going</text>
  <text start="339.14" dur="6.21">to use the CrowdStrike report to support</text>
  <text start="342.23" dur="6.12">the rumored upcoming charges against the</text>
  <text start="345.35" dur="6.3">Russian hackers and he&amp;#39;s going to use</text>
  <text start="348.35" dur="5.61">this to try to build his case around</text>
  <text start="351.65" dur="4.89">this but we need to understand that the</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="6.51">CrowdStrike founder and anti Putin</text>
  <text start="356.54" dur="6.15">Russian expat Dmitri Alber ovitch sits</text>
  <text start="360.47" dur="4.65">on the Atlantic Council which is funded</text>
  <text start="362.69" dur="5.16">by the US State Department NATO Latvia</text>
  <text start="365.12" dur="5.64">Lithuania Ukrainian oligarch Viktor</text>
  <text start="367.85" dur="5.88">Pinchuk who else is on the Atlantic</text>
  <text start="370.76" dur="6.24">Council Evelyn Farkas who slipped up</text>
  <text start="373.73" dur="5.34">during an MS MSNBC interview with Mika</text>
  <text start="377" dur="3.9">Brzezinski and disclosed that the Obama</text>
  <text start="379.07" dur="4.08">administration had been spying on the</text>
  <text start="380.9" dur="4.11">Trump campaign she went on to say that</text>
  <text start="383.15" dur="4.2">the Trump folks if they found out how we</text>
  <text start="385.01" dur="4.68">knew what we knew about the Trump staff</text>
  <text start="387.35" dur="4.29">dealing with Russians that they would</text>
  <text start="389.69" dur="3.93">try to compromise those sources and</text>
  <text start="391.64" dur="5.37">methods meaning we would no longer have</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="5.04">access to that intelligence and we see</text>
  <text start="397.01" dur="3.54">right now that all these individuals all</text>
  <text start="398.66" dur="5.24">these groups they&amp;#39;re all interconnected</text>
  <text start="400.55" dur="6.54">this was planned from the beginning</text>
  <text start="403.9" dur="5.29">because they&amp;#39;re trying to cover their</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="4.83">tracks but it&amp;#39;s all falling apart the</text>
  <text start="409.19" dur="5.4">narrative is falling apart very very</text>
  <text start="411.92" dur="4.83">quickly just like the narrative in North</text>
  <text start="414.59" dur="5.46">Korea where they&amp;#39;re developing a nuclear</text>
  <text start="416.75" dur="5.19">weapon they&amp;#39;re testing their missile</text>
  <text start="420.05" dur="5.55">systems to strike the United States</text>
  <text start="421.94" dur="5.94">because that whole story is completely</text>
  <text start="425.6" dur="4.2">falling apart because South Korea has</text>
  <text start="427.88" dur="4.29">appointed a ten member delegation of</text>
  <text start="429.8" dur="4.31">diplomats led by the head of national</text>
  <text start="432.17" dur="3.99">security office and the nice nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.11" dur="3.88">intelligence chief who have been</text>
  <text start="436.16" dur="5.13">dispatched in North Korea for two days</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="6.6">worth of talks that begin on Monday</text>
  <text start="441.29" dur="5.73">which is today the deployment is South</text>
  <text start="444.59" dur="5.67">Korea&amp;#39;s attempt both to negotiate a</text>
  <text start="447.02" dur="5.01">possible visit by president moon jae-in</text>
  <text start="450.26" dur="6.27">to North Korea</text>
  <text start="452.03" dur="8.28">in the future and most importantly try</text>
  <text start="456.53" dur="6.81">to bolster talks between North Korea and</text>
  <text start="460.31" dur="6.12">the United States now Trump has reported</text>
  <text start="463.34" dur="5.88">that North Korea had directly contacted</text>
  <text start="466.43" dur="7.11">him a couple of days ago prior with an</text>
  <text start="469.22" dur="7.56">offer of direct diplomacy now if this is</text>
  <text start="473.54" dur="6.96">confirmed that North Korea is reaching</text>
  <text start="476.78" dur="5.7">out and again Russia China there behind</text>
  <text start="480.5" dur="3.18">all this we have a freeze freeze plan</text>
  <text start="482.48" dur="4.08">going on right now</text>
  <text start="483.68" dur="4.32">what is the corporate media going to say</text>
  <text start="486.56" dur="3.15">I mean of course they&amp;#39;ll probably make</text>
  <text start="488" dur="3.51">something up but if North Korea is</text>
  <text start="489.71" dur="4.47">reaching out and this is actually a</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="4.86">pretty darn good strategy instead of</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="4.05">Trump going in saying we want peace</text>
  <text start="496.37" dur="4.16">because then they can make a whole type</text>
  <text start="498.23" dur="4.68">of some type of story</text>
  <text start="500.53" dur="4.38">where North Korea doesn&amp;#39;t want to have</text>
  <text start="502.91" dur="5.3">peace and they can have a false flag</text>
  <text start="504.91" dur="6.52">this way North Korea is reaching out</text>
  <text start="508.21" dur="5.65">asking for peace wants to talk to the</text>
  <text start="511.43" dur="3.44">United States and if this is all</text>
  <text start="513.86" dur="3.39">confirmed</text>
  <text start="514.87" dur="5.53">well the deep state they have a much</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="5.07">harder time pushing a false flag because</text>
  <text start="520.4" dur="3.63">it doesn&amp;#39;t fit into the narrative now</text>
  <text start="522.32" dur="4.74">can they still push one of course they</text>
  <text start="524.03" dur="8.1">can but it will be shot down very very</text>
  <text start="527.06" dur="8.55">quickly by South Korea by Russia by</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="6.27">China because they know what is going on</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="6.9">right now because they&amp;#39;re setting all of</text>
  <text start="538.4" dur="7.68">this up and having North Korea contact</text>
  <text start="542.51" dur="7.74">the United States well the whole entire</text>
  <text start="546.08" dur="6.509">narrative then shifts and we can see</text>
  <text start="550.25" dur="4.29">right now that they want to put this</text>
  <text start="552.589" dur="4.021">whole thing to rest they want peace</text>
  <text start="554.54" dur="4.95">this way the deep state can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="556.61" dur="4.17">anything else in this area this is why</text>
  <text start="559.49" dur="4.14">but they&amp;#39;ve been trying to link North</text>
  <text start="560.78" dur="5.25">Korea with Syria and so forth now we</text>
  <text start="563.63" dur="5.51">talked about this dead cat bounce now</text>
  <text start="566.03" dur="7.49">what this means is we had this event in</text>
  <text start="569.14" dur="6.58">parkland Florida the event is dying down</text>
  <text start="573.52" dur="4.48">it&amp;#39;s pretty much out of the news cycle</text>
  <text start="575.72" dur="5.61">maybe every so often you hear about it</text>
  <text start="578" dur="4.89">but it&amp;#39;s dying down very very quickly</text>
  <text start="581.33" dur="4.14">kids have returned to school</text>
  <text start="582.89" dur="5.55">testing is coming up</text>
  <text start="585.47" dur="6.24">and this whole thing is pretty much done</text>
  <text start="588.44" dur="5.49">and what is happening right now is that</text>
  <text start="591.71" dur="4.08">they need to report on other things</text>
  <text start="593.93" dur="3.6">which they don&amp;#39;t want to report on and</text>
  <text start="595.79" dur="3.69">of course they have a lot of propaganda</text>
  <text start="597.53" dur="3.21">crap that they&amp;#39;re throwing up there so</text>
  <text start="599.48" dur="3.27">what they need to do to gain the</text>
  <text start="600.74" dur="5.43">narrative once again is they need to</text>
  <text start="602.75" dur="7.53">have another event and we talked about</text>
  <text start="606.17" dur="7.08">Dallas q is hinting that it might happen</text>
  <text start="610.28" dur="6.6">in Houston there might be a possible</text>
  <text start="613.25" dur="5.67">imminent attack in this area don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="616.88" dur="4.35">exactly what it is it could be a bomb it</text>
  <text start="618.92" dur="4.23">could be a shooting it could be anything</text>
  <text start="621.23" dur="5.49">it doesn&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t know what it will be</text>
  <text start="623.15" dur="7.46">but it could be something and we see</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="7.98">right now that Q is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="630.61" dur="7.78">dropping hints saying why is sessions</text>
  <text start="634.7" dur="5.58">acting weak with regards to the</text>
  <text start="638.39" dur="4.95">investigation and I think this is all</text>
  <text start="640.28" dur="4.68">being done on purpose to throw the</text>
  <text start="643.34" dur="4.8">corporate media to throw the deep state</text>
  <text start="644.96" dur="5.52">off to make it look like Trump is</text>
  <text start="648.14" dur="3.09">struggling to get this investigation</text>
  <text start="650.48" dur="2.91">going</text>
  <text start="651.23" dur="5.7">and I think behind the scenes the</text>
  <text start="653.39" dur="5.25">investigation is ongoing I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="656.93" dur="3.3">doing what they need to do and they have</text>
  <text start="658.64" dur="4.02">a lot more information and it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="660.23" dur="4.65">going for it quite a while and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="662.66" dur="6.69">trying to make it look like that is just</text>
  <text start="664.88" dur="7.38">getting off the ground to confuse what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="669.35" dur="6.24">going on now the inspector general that</text>
  <text start="672.26" dur="6.78">report is supposed to be coming out</text>
  <text start="675.59" dur="7.41">about pretty much everything here and if</text>
  <text start="679.04" dur="7.29">you notice there were no leaks coming</text>
  <text start="683" dur="4.89">from the inspector general report and it</text>
  <text start="686.33" dur="3.99">looks like the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="687.89" dur="6.51">trying to stage the narrative of what</text>
  <text start="690.32" dur="7.35">this is going to entail and who it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="694.4" dur="5.43">going to implicate everything about FISA</text>
  <text start="697.67" dur="5.55">and things like that and we see right</text>
  <text start="699.83" dur="7.29">now that the deep state is very very</text>
  <text start="703.22" dur="6.51">worried and this is why they are most</text>
  <text start="707.12" dur="4.41">likely going to have this dead cat</text>
  <text start="709.73" dur="4.32">bounce where they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="711.53" dur="5.61">gain the narrative once again but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="714.05" dur="4.98">going to be short-lived and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
