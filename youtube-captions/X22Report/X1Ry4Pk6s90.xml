  <text start="88.69" dur="4.77">going after the deep state is not enough</text>
  <text start="91.179" dur="4.53">we need to go to the source of the</text>
  <text start="93.46" dur="4.65">problem the source of the funding that</text>
  <text start="95.709" dur="6.66">is the central bank that is the Federal</text>
  <text start="98.11" dur="7.89">Reserve and we understand that there</text>
  <text start="102.369" dur="5.431">needs to be change which means the</text>
  <text start="106" dur="5.369">Federal Reserve needs to be brought down</text>
  <text start="107.8" dur="5.489">they need to be exposed and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="111.369" dur="4.651">starting to see the beginning stages of</text>
  <text start="113.289" dur="5.131">all this because we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="116.02" dur="4.469">needs to fill seats in the Federal</text>
  <text start="118.42" dur="4.47">Reserve now remember there&amp;#39;s good guys</text>
  <text start="120.489" dur="6.651">and there&amp;#39;s bad guys Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="122.89" dur="7.64">put individuals in position to help</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="7.239">restructure the Federal Reserve to</text>
  <text start="130.53" dur="6.13">remove the Federal Reserve from the</text>
  <text start="134.379" dur="6">control of the Rothschild banking system</text>
  <text start="136.66" dur="7.59">and put it back into the hands of the</text>
  <text start="140.379" dur="6.151">people and eventually completely get rid</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="4.92">of the Federal Reserve and just make the</text>
  <text start="146.53" dur="5.819">Treasury create the currency because as</text>
  <text start="149.17" dur="6.09">we know the Federal Reserve they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="152.349" dur="5.341">in a position to benefit the American</text>
  <text start="155.26" dur="5.46">people their position is to benefit</text>
  <text start="157.69" dur="5.43">themselves to spread debt around the</text>
  <text start="160.72" dur="5.64">world to create chaos</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="5.01">and to manipulate the economy because</text>
  <text start="166.36" dur="3.21">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is not an</text>
  <text start="168.13" dur="4.47">open and free economy</text>
  <text start="169.57" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s a manipulated economy from the</text>
  <text start="172.6" dur="5.63">stock market to the statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="175.15" dur="6.63">to everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing now</text>
  <text start="178.23" dur="6.52">Trump does have the magic wand and he</text>
  <text start="181.78" dur="5.76">needs to continually use it remember we</text>
  <text start="184.75" dur="5.64">have many things going on at once and he</text>
  <text start="187.54" dur="5.58">needs to control the mainstream media he</text>
  <text start="190.39" dur="6.63">needs to control the deep state the</text>
  <text start="193.12" dur="6.63">central bank from blaming him for</text>
  <text start="197.02" dur="5.85">bringing down the economy so he needs to</text>
  <text start="199.75" dur="6.93">control all of that and he&amp;#39;s doing that</text>
  <text start="202.87" dur="5.52">by using those tools deep state and the</text>
  <text start="206.68" dur="4.62">central banks have used for many many</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="3.99">years and it the deep state and the</text>
  <text start="211.3" dur="3.48">central banks are finding at a very</text>
  <text start="212.38" dur="3.75">difficult time to counter what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.78" dur="6">saying I mean look at the initial</text>
  <text start="216.13" dur="7.17">jobless claims they are the lowest in 50</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="5.82">years I mean we need to go all the way</text>
  <text start="223.3" dur="5.55">back to 1969 that&amp;#39;s where we are with</text>
  <text start="226.6" dur="5.13">initial jobless claims so here&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="228.85" dur="7.05">context so you can understand back then</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="6.78">in 1969 the Beatles Abbey Road album hit</text>
  <text start="235.9" dur="4.11">number one Wendy&amp;#39;s hamburgers American</text>
  <text start="238.51" dur="4.31">fast food restaurant chains founded by</text>
  <text start="240.01" dur="5.7">Dave Thomas opens in Columbus Ohio</text>
  <text start="242.82" dur="6.28">Alcatraz Island office San Francisco is</text>
  <text start="245.71" dur="5.34">seized by militant Native Americans u.s.</text>
  <text start="249.1" dur="3.81">performs nuclear tests at Nevada&amp;#39;s Test</text>
  <text start="251.05" dur="4.14">Site and if you really think about if</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="5.52">you go back to that time period we were</text>
  <text start="255.19" dur="5.46">still on the gold standard we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="4.11">come off the gold standard until 1971 of</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="3.45">course they were in the process of</text>
  <text start="262.54" dur="4.05">setting up the hope the whole</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="4.92">petrodollar system but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="3.84">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="269.02" dur="5.13">when you look at the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="270.43" dur="6.69">claims it matches up perfectly to when</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="5.67">we had a recession and if you go back to</text>
  <text start="277.12" dur="4.56">the 70s moving all the way forward every</text>
  <text start="279.82" dur="5.25">time initial jobless claims hit the</text>
  <text start="281.68" dur="5.91">lowest at that time we entered a</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="6">recession now right now we&amp;#39;re going all</text>
  <text start="287.59" dur="7.35">the way back to 1969 if you look at all</text>
  <text start="291.07" dur="5.7">the recessions you know from 1970 all</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="4.05">the way up to 2019</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="3.899">we are at the lowest point that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="298.99" dur="4.23">ever seen</text>
  <text start="300.669" dur="4.801">which means this recession this</text>
  <text start="303.22" dur="4.349">depression this collapse is going to be</text>
  <text start="305.47" dur="3.93">bigger than we&amp;#39;ve ever seen before</text>
  <text start="307.569" dur="5.91">and we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="309.4" dur="6.479">important here Trump is using everything</text>
  <text start="313.479" dur="3.81">he possibly can to prepare the United</text>
  <text start="315.879" dur="4.921">States for this</text>
  <text start="317.289" dur="5.88">he&amp;#39;s cutting budgets he&amp;#39;s deregulating</text>
  <text start="320.8" dur="5.16">he&amp;#39;s bringing manufacturing back he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.169" dur="5.28">making new trade deals with China why is</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="4.07">he doing all this well remember when we</text>
  <text start="328.449" dur="5.071">were on the petro dollar system</text>
  <text start="330.03" dur="7.389">countries kept the dollar in reserves</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="4.88">they use these funds to purchase our</text>
  <text start="337.419" dur="3.301">goods</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="4.9">well when the United States when I</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="5.21">should say when the Federal Reserve debt</text>
  <text start="343.3" dur="5.31">note is no longer the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="345.93" dur="4.84">everything needs to change because they</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="6.54">won&amp;#39;t be holding the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="350.77" dur="8.1">Note any longer so we need to have trade</text>
  <text start="355.15" dur="6.269">deals in place to handle the next phase</text>
  <text start="358.87" dur="4.799">of the economy which is going to be the</text>
  <text start="361.419" dur="5.93">new economy that Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="363.669" dur="6.451">are creating and he needs to cut</text>
  <text start="367.349" dur="5.651">expenses I mean just like any business</text>
  <text start="370.12" dur="6.419">just like anything else the United</text>
  <text start="373" dur="6.12">States cannot continually pay out what</text>
  <text start="376.539" dur="7.591">it&amp;#39;s paying out right now it just won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="379.12" dur="8.9">work and Trump he wants to cut about 10</text>
  <text start="384.13" dur="7.439">billion a year to the UN Congress</text>
  <text start="388.02" dur="5.799">continually stops him now Congress has</text>
  <text start="391.569" dur="5.431">been stopping Trump in many things that</text>
  <text start="393.819" dur="5.16">he wants to do because remember the</text>
  <text start="397" dur="4.409">system that were in now a lot of these</text>
  <text start="398.979" dur="6.18">individuals they make a lot of money</text>
  <text start="401.409" dur="7.021">they like this system and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="405.159" dur="6.451">want it to end because it benefits for</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="6.75">that benefits them actually it corrupts</text>
  <text start="411.61" dur="6.149">them but you could see that Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="415.18" dur="3.51">trying to cut expenses anywhere he</text>
  <text start="417.759" dur="4.56">possibly can</text>
  <text start="418.69" dur="8.67">he&amp;#39;s also using the free money to build</text>
  <text start="422.319" dur="6.57">and and and create jobs improve the</text>
  <text start="427.36" dur="3.4">infrastructure of the United States</text>
  <text start="428.889" dur="4.061">so why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="430.76" dur="5.31">all because he only has a short window</text>
  <text start="432.95" dur="6.95">here so he&amp;#39;s using the free money from</text>
  <text start="436.07" dur="8.4">the Federal Reserve racking up debt</text>
  <text start="439.9" dur="6.55">creating new trade deals and trying to</text>
  <text start="444.47" dur="5.19">put the United States on the right track</text>
  <text start="446.45" dur="5.55">now he doesn&amp;#39;t care about the deficit he</text>
  <text start="449.66" dur="4.02">doesn&amp;#39;t really care about the debt he</text>
  <text start="452" dur="4.23">doesn&amp;#39;t care about this because he knows</text>
  <text start="453.68" dur="6.54">in the end this is all going to</text>
  <text start="456.23" dur="7.5">disappear how well once he ordered to</text>
  <text start="460.22" dur="4.95">the Fed and shows the world and makes it</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="4.41">completely transparent that there are</text>
  <text start="465.17" dur="5.91">criminal organization guess what we</text>
  <text start="468.14" dur="5.88">don&amp;#39;t have to pay this back it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="471.08" dur="5.88">under their mandate to loan or create</text>
  <text start="474.02" dur="5.61">currency to an N and send it off to</text>
  <text start="476.96" dur="4.79">other countries or to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="479.63" dur="5.28">interest rates or to manipulate</text>
  <text start="481.75" dur="6.4">businesses and other things and again I</text>
  <text start="484.91" dur="5.25">say that the Federal Reserve they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="488.15" dur="3.96">have such a great track record I mean</text>
  <text start="490.16" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re making it seem like well we need</text>
  <text start="492.11" dur="4.23">the Federal Reserve because it manages</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="5.7">the economy we need the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="496.34" dur="4.77">because it creates the currency well we</text>
  <text start="499.88" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t need a Federal Reserve to push a</text>
  <text start="501.11" dur="5.34">button there&amp;#39;s no reason for the Federal</text>
  <text start="503.72" dur="4.95">Reserve and managing the country well</text>
  <text start="506.45" dur="4.65">they haven&amp;#39;t been doing a great job here</text>
  <text start="508.67" dur="4.08">let&amp;#39;s go back in time here I mean we go</text>
  <text start="511.1" dur="4.11">back to the 70s when we&amp;#39;re coming off</text>
  <text start="512.75" dur="3.44">the gold standard guess what we were in</text>
  <text start="515.21" dur="4.26">a recession</text>
  <text start="516.19" dur="6.82">fast forward to 1980 we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="519.47" dur="7.22">recession again go around 1981 1982</text>
  <text start="523.01" dur="8.4">we&amp;#39;re in another recession then we hit</text>
  <text start="526.69" dur="9.07">1990 were in another recession 2000 2001</text>
  <text start="531.41" dur="7.65">another recession 2008 to 2009 another</text>
  <text start="535.76" dur="5.55">recession so when you look at the track</text>
  <text start="539.06" dur="6.12">record it&amp;#39;s not that great if you go</text>
  <text start="541.31" dur="6.39">back even further it gets even worse so</text>
  <text start="545.18" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re not really helping the people</text>
  <text start="547.7" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re really not helping the country</text>
  <text start="550.4" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re helping themselves they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="553.43" dur="6.63">helping Wall Street they&amp;#39;re helping the</text>
  <text start="556.52" dur="5.67">deep state they&amp;#39;re helping everyone but</text>
  <text start="560.06" dur="3.35">the people I mean just think about this</text>
  <text start="562.19" dur="2.889">for a second since</text>
  <text start="563.41" dur="4.26">the Federal Reserve came into existence</text>
  <text start="565.079" dur="5.891">the dollar has lost value its lost</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="6">something like 97 98 percent which means</text>
  <text start="570.97" dur="5.4">it takes a lot more of this paper funny</text>
  <text start="573.67" dur="4.26">money to purchase an item even though</text>
  <text start="576.37" dur="2.759">the production and things like that is</text>
  <text start="577.93" dur="3.899">getting cheaper and cheaper to make</text>
  <text start="579.129" dur="6.57">things it still takes a lot more dollars</text>
  <text start="581.829" dur="6.721">to buy the same item which tells you</text>
  <text start="585.699" dur="4.981">that it is not benefiting the people</text>
  <text start="588.55" dur="5.039">because now those people who were making</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="4.349">minimum wage it&amp;#39;s a lot more difficult</text>
  <text start="593.589" dur="3.81">this is why they have to continually</text>
  <text start="595.029" dur="5.461">raise the minimum wage just to keep up</text>
  <text start="597.399" dur="5.94">this is why you need the cost of living</text>
  <text start="600.49" dur="7.8">wage each year which barely helps you</text>
  <text start="603.339" dur="7.381">out because the dollar continually loses</text>
  <text start="608.29" dur="4.649">value when you hear inflation people</text>
  <text start="610.72" dur="5.609">think that the products are going up in</text>
  <text start="612.939" dur="6.21">price no it&amp;#39;s the dollar losing value</text>
  <text start="616.329" dur="5.041">every day and there&amp;#39;s many companies out</text>
  <text start="619.149" dur="4.651">there who decided to stop giving the</text>
  <text start="621.37" dur="7.469">cost-of-living increase which makes it</text>
  <text start="623.8" dur="6.209">difficult for people to survive and what</text>
  <text start="628.839" dur="3.24">they needed to do when I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="630.009" dur="4.44">the central bank&amp;#39;s they needed to come</text>
  <text start="632.079" dur="4.651">out with another way to allow people to</text>
  <text start="634.449" dur="4.14">live because think about it today if</text>
  <text start="636.73" dur="4.26">everyone just got rid of all their</text>
  <text start="638.589" dur="5.31">credit cards and you couldn&amp;#39;t take out</text>
  <text start="640.99" dur="5.789">loans to purchase anything a car or a</text>
  <text start="643.899" dur="6.18">washer and a dryer and you couldn&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="646.779" dur="6.951">your credit cards for rent or food or to</text>
  <text start="650.079" dur="6.841">purchase get rid of all credit cards can</text>
  <text start="653.73" dur="7.089">America survive can the people of</text>
  <text start="656.92" dur="7.56">America live no this is why they needed</text>
  <text start="660.819" dur="6.661">to introduce credit in the late 70s</text>
  <text start="664.48" dur="5.549">going into the early 80s because this is</text>
  <text start="667.48" dur="4.969">one thing started to break down and as</text>
  <text start="670.029" dur="6.03">we went through the 90s it got worse</text>
  <text start="672.449" dur="6.75">2000 even worse than that and this is</text>
  <text start="676.059" dur="6.661">why you see the credit card debt so high</text>
