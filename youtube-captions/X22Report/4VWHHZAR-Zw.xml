  <text start="172.38" dur="5.28">right back under the 14 hundred dollar</text>
  <text start="175.08" dur="4.23">mark I plus you know while we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="177.66" dur="4.91">this they&amp;#39;re showing that gold is</text>
  <text start="179.31" dur="6.57">unstable they don&amp;#39;t want it to go up and</text>
  <text start="182.57" dur="7.81">they want everyone to put their money</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="7.2">into stocks and even on MarketWatch they</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="5.79">had an article saying that Bernanke</text>
  <text start="193.08" dur="6.66">dares you to put your money into stocks</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="6">and they want everyone in and as soon as</text>
  <text start="199.74" dur="4.8">everyone is in and they can&amp;#39;t pump this</text>
  <text start="202.17" dur="4.17">up and everything just can&amp;#39;t keep going</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s just going to come tumbling down</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="8.13">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this over and over and</text>
  <text start="208.89" dur="8.94">over in history I mean we know all of</text>
  <text start="214.47" dur="6.41">this is not real I mean look at this the</text>
  <text start="217.83" dur="5.76">euros iresine the eurozone unemployment</text>
  <text start="220.88" dur="5.079">hits another record high of 12 point two</text>
  <text start="223.59" dur="5.28">percent they went back they revised the</text>
  <text start="225.959" dur="7.5">numbers but we&amp;#39;re seeing unemployment</text>
  <text start="228.87" dur="9.38">across the globe at record high numbers</text>
  <text start="233.459" dur="8.701">especially with the youth in Greece in</text>
  <text start="238.25" dur="6.55">Germany in Spain in Portugal I mean</text>
  <text start="242.16" dur="7.02">we&amp;#39;re at numbers at fifty sixty percent</text>
  <text start="244.8" dur="8.1">and here we are a 12.2 percent and let</text>
  <text start="249.18" dur="7.71">me just say if they didn&amp;#39;t change the</text>
  <text start="252.9" dur="7.47">calculations here in America we would be</text>
  <text start="256.89" dur="6.69">a 23-percent but again it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="5.58">complete it&amp;#39;s an illusion and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="5.64">you know it nothing feels real anymore</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="5.37">because it&amp;#39;s all fake they massage all</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="5.49">the numbers that change the calculations</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="7.82">for inflation GDP you name it they</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="8.84">change it so nobody who is sleeping</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="13.35">awakens and you can see this everywhere</text>
  <text start="283.55" dur="8.94">now there was a a a problem with the GMO</text>
  <text start="293.3" dur="5.44">contamination of wheat fields and now it</text>
  <text start="297.33" dur="3.3">looks like all the wheat fields are</text>
  <text start="298.74" dur="5.19">contaminated and there are countries now</text>
  <text start="300.63" dur="5.97">like Japan who&amp;#39;s saying we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="4.5">the wheat and South Korea now joins in</text>
  <text start="306.6" dur="3.3">saying we don&amp;#39;t want the weed either and</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re going to see more and more</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="5.25">countries come out and say we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="312.33" dur="4.47">this because especially in Europe they</text>
  <text start="315.15" dur="5.39">don&amp;#39;t even allow high fructose corn</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="6.21">syrup like they do here in America and</text>
  <text start="320.54" dur="4.36">they&amp;#39;re going to see this and say you</text>
  <text start="323.01" dur="6.48">know what we don&amp;#39;t want this stuff</text>
  <text start="324.9" dur="8.07">either and this is going to be a problem</text>
  <text start="329.49" dur="6.63">here because this food is one of our</text>
  <text start="332.97" dur="5.46">major exports right now and if nobody</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="5.28">wants this stuff and we have to destroy</text>
  <text start="338.43" dur="5.49">all the fields because they all been</text>
  <text start="341.4" dur="5.24">contaminated you know what is going to</text>
  <text start="343.92" dur="6.66">happen with a lot of the food supply and</text>
  <text start="346.64" dur="9.13">this this could be the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="7.41">end and who knows I mean it just it just</text>
  <text start="355.77" dur="5.31">does not look good especially what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="6.3">happening in Japan how the Nikkei has is</text>
  <text start="361.08" dur="7.92">off their highs of like sixteen percent</text>
  <text start="364.29" dur="8.01">and it was down again something like let</text>
  <text start="369" dur="7.11">me say it was it went down 513 points it</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="8.52">dropped again and it dropped another 2%</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="7.53">I mean everyone said that Japan is going</text>
  <text start="380.82" dur="4.68">to be the first domino the falls and it</text>
  <text start="383.64" dur="4.11">looks like whatever they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="385.5" dur="6.23">by printing whatever it is 130 billion</text>
  <text start="387.75" dur="7.5">dollars a month it is not working and</text>
  <text start="391.73" dur="5.95">it&amp;#39;s just plummeting further and further</text>
  <text start="395.25" dur="5.34">down but what&amp;#39;s funny is you don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="6.75">any of this in the mainstream media you</text>
  <text start="400.59" dur="6.9">actually see none of it and you know</text>
  <text start="404.43" dur="4.139">because they don&amp;#39;t want to let everyone</text>
  <text start="407.49" dur="3.81">know what&amp;#39;s happe</text>
  <text start="408.569" dur="4.761">I mean they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re stuck on</text>
  <text start="411.3" dur="9.169">the tornadoes which is a terrible thing</text>
  <text start="413.33" dur="13.299">but again that news is for a specific</text>
  <text start="420.469" dur="9.19">area the news about a country basically</text>
  <text start="426.629" dur="6.06">starting off a domino effect going</text>
  <text start="429.659" dur="6.3">across the West through Europe to</text>
  <text start="432.689" dur="7.111">America and collapsing the world is huge</text>
  <text start="435.959" dur="9.75">huge news and you really see nothing</text>

  <text start="553.05" dur="4.17">know Wall Street is buzzing about the</text>
  <text start="555.21" dur="4.89">fact that the Hindenburg omen appeared</text>
  <text start="557.22" dur="6.57">at the end of last week so what exactly</text>
  <text start="560.1" dur="5.1">is the independent omen and this is what</text>
  <text start="563.79" dur="3.57">it is the daily number of the New York</text>
  <text start="565.2" dur="5.52">Stock Exchange new 52-week highs and the</text>
  <text start="567.36" dur="5.49">daily number of new 52-week lows must be</text>

  <text start="578.55" dur="5.22">numbers is greater than or equal to 69</text>
  <text start="581.27" dur="4.93">this is not a rule but more like a</text>
  <text start="583.77" dur="4.29">checksum that the New York Stock</text>
  <text start="586.2" dur="6.29">Exchange 10-week moving average is</text>

  <text start="616.2" dur="3.3">the US stock market is like to</text>
  <text start="617.94" dur="5.76">experience a serious decline within the</text>
  <text start="619.5" dur="6.6">next 40 days and I believe that you know</text>
  <text start="623.7" dur="4.74">they will try to hold this off as far as</text>
  <text start="626.1" dur="5.7">they can go and I said this before that</text>
  <text start="628.44" dur="5.88">I believe that these the the collapse is</text>
  <text start="631.8" dur="5.789">not going to happen all at once I</text>
  <text start="634.32" dur="7.8">believe in probably around September</text>

  <text start="642.12" dur="3.45">might see a small one a little bit</text>
  <text start="643.8" dur="4.95">before that the September will be a</text>
  <text start="645.57" dur="5.19">bigger one and banks you know and and</text>
  <text start="648.75" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ll have to we&amp;#39;ll go through all the</text>
  <text start="650.76" dur="4.92">bail ins with pensions and then they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="653.28" dur="3.9">move to bank accounts and they&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="655.68" dur="3.75">this is the only time we&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="657.18" dur="4.08">it don&amp;#39;t worry about it they&amp;#39;ll try to</text>
  <text start="659.43" dur="3.99">pump up the markets again they will for</text>
  <text start="661.26" dur="4.079">a short period of time the American</text>
  <text start="663.42" dur="5.12">people will say okay it&amp;#39;s not that bad</text>
  <text start="665.339" dur="5.641">and everyone will go back sleep</text>
  <text start="668.54" dur="4.63">companies will lay off people more</text>
  <text start="670.98" dur="4.5">people will be out of work and in three</text>
  <text start="673.17" dur="2.67">months or so later another big huge</text>
  <text start="675.48" dur="2.34">crowd</text>
  <text start="675.84" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;ll come and that&amp;#39;s when they&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="5.73">everyone&amp;#39;s money from the banks just</text>
  <text start="679.8" dur="6.75">like they did during 2008 they started</text>
  <text start="683.55" dur="6">out AIG just needs this one bailout it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.55" dur="5.61">not that big of a deal and as months</text>
  <text start="689.55" dur="4.29">went along everything just got worse and</text>
  <text start="692.16" dur="4.65">worse and worse in the market just kept</text>
  <text start="693.84" dur="6.69">on going down and down and down people</text>
  <text start="696.81" dur="5.34">lost a lot of their pension money people</text>
  <text start="700.53" dur="4.89">lost a lot of their money in the market</text>
  <text start="702.15" dur="11.22">and this time it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot</text>
  <text start="705.42" dur="10.59">worse so let&amp;#39;s move on here now there</text>
  <text start="713.37" dur="5.37">were five Israeli military aircraft that</text>
  <text start="716.01" dur="5.46">violated the Lebanese airspace and this</text>
  <text start="718.74" dur="5.85">is basically trying to provoke other</text>
