  <text start="65.82" dur="6.659">Fed is now cornered by this one move</text>
  <text start="68.61" dur="6.45">trust the plan let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="72.479" dur="5.581">economic collapse financial news so we</text>
  <text start="75.06" dur="5.54">know that the central bankers they do</text>
  <text start="78.06" dur="5.1">not want the brexit plan to move forward</text>
  <text start="80.6" dur="4">they&amp;#39;ll do whatever it takes to stop it</text>
  <text start="83.16" dur="3.9">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="4.409">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing a lot of individuals</text>
  <text start="87.06" dur="4.23">resign their position because the brexit</text>
  <text start="89.009" dur="4.651">is not going the way the people would</text>
  <text start="91.29" dur="7.88">like it to go remember the people voted</text>
  <text start="93.66" dur="9.3">to vote Britain away from the EU and</text>
  <text start="99.17" dur="7.99">they want to break free from it but the</text>
  <text start="102.96" dur="7.98">EU is trying to keep them in some way or</text>
  <text start="107.16" dur="5.28">another within the EU system and we can</text>
  <text start="110.94" dur="4.11">see from the plan that was drawn up by</text>
  <text start="112.44" dur="6.63">Teresa May it looks like this is what is</text>
  <text start="115.05" dur="6.179">happening and her Minister well this</text>
  <text start="119.07" dur="5.46">individual is ratcheting up warnings</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="6.18">that the brexit talks might end in</text>
  <text start="124.53" dur="4.769">failure the British government has</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="4.441">increased the pressure on the EU in</text>
  <text start="129.299" dur="4.47">recent weeks urging the bloc to loosen</text>
  <text start="131.85" dur="4.889">its red lines and come to an</text>
  <text start="133.769" dur="4.321">accommodation over brexit part of the UK</text>
  <text start="136.739" dur="4.771">strategy involves giving greater</text>
  <text start="138.09" dur="6.99">visibility for No Deal planning there is</text>
  <text start="141.51" dur="5.94">now a 60% likelihood of a No Deal</text>
  <text start="145.08" dur="4.5">outcome as the clock ticks down to</text>
  <text start="147.45" dur="4.259">Britain&amp;#39;s scheduled departure in March</text>
  <text start="149.58" dur="3.96">and once again the EU is going to make</text>
  <text start="151.709" dur="3.571">this very very difficult and many of the</text>
  <text start="153.54" dur="4.08">individuals that read this white paper</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re saying no way this is not what</text>
  <text start="157.62" dur="5.01">the people wanted and of course we know</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="3.33">what the central bankers always want</text>
  <text start="162.63" dur="3.3">they want control and they&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="4.38">gonna just give up control</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ll just never ever do it they will</text>
  <text start="168.72" dur="4.17">fight back until the very very end</text>
  <text start="170.61" dur="4.23">because that&amp;#39;s what their whole business</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="4.53">is about that&amp;#39;s what their whole agenda</text>
  <text start="174.84" dur="5.489">is about it&amp;#39;s about controlling each and</text>
  <text start="177.42" dur="5.129">every country controlling the world this</text>
  <text start="180.329" dur="4.171">is why they loan money to governments</text>
  <text start="182.549" dur="4.291">this is why they put them into debt to</text>
  <text start="184.5" dur="4.86">control them I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="186.84" dur="5.97">you don&amp;#39;t need a massive military you</text>
  <text start="189.36" dur="6.239">don&amp;#39;t need an entire army you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="5.819">any of that all you need to do is create</text>
  <text start="195.599" dur="6.151">fake money currency I should really say</text>
  <text start="198.629" dur="5.461">and loan it to the government&amp;#39;s and then</text>
  <text start="201.75" dur="4.59">their indebted to you and then you can</text>
  <text start="204.09" dur="5.64">control them because they have to listen</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="4.77">to what you say or guess what you</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="3.869">collect on that debt and if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="211.11" dur="8.219">have the funds guess what they come</text>
  <text start="213.599" dur="8.011">after your real assets and this is the</text>
  <text start="219.329" dur="5.49">easiest way to control a nation and a</text>
  <text start="221.61" dur="7.68">central bank will never give up that</text>
  <text start="224.819" dur="7.321">control now we see the global economic</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="5.13">system breaking down and we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="232.14" dur="4.62">lot of retail stores they&amp;#39;re declaring</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="5.099">bankruptcy here in the US we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="236.76" dur="5.009">Toys R Us Banton and many many others</text>
  <text start="239.519" dur="5.341">declare bankruptcy well there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="241.769" dur="8.58">retailer this is mattress from this is</text>
  <text start="244.86" dur="7.74">the u.s. mattress retailing giant and it</text>
  <text start="250.349" dur="5.971">looks like they&amp;#39;re having a huge amount</text>
  <text start="252.6" dur="5.49">of problems the Mattress Firm which is</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="3.87">the largest u.s. mattress retailer is</text>
  <text start="258.09" dur="5.009">planning to file for bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="260.19" dur="6">the firm&amp;#39;s is struggling to exit costly</text>
  <text start="263.099" dur="5.731">store leases and shut some 3,000</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="4.86">locations that are losing money now of</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="3.959">course they brought into the story that</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="3.6">Amazon is the cause of this everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="272.789" dur="3.541">buying their mattresses from the Amazon</text>
  <text start="274.65" dur="4.019">and again mattress firm has an online</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="4.62">presence and it&amp;#39;s very difficult to buy</text>
  <text start="278.669" dur="5.041">an mattress online you go to the store</text>
  <text start="280.95" dur="5.16">you lay on it you want to feel what it</text>
  <text start="283.71" dur="4.44">feels like and then you make a decision</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="4.23">and a lot of these stores they have the</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="3.989">same day delivery and it doesn&amp;#39;t cost</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="3.87">anything it&amp;#39;s free delivery and it makes</text>
  <text start="292.139" dur="5.521">no sense why online would be winning out</text>
  <text start="294.21" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re using this to convince you this</text>
  <text start="297.66" dur="3.84">is why all these stores are closing</text>
  <text start="299.43" dur="3.419">think about it in the beginning what</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="3.599">they did was they told you it was the</text>
  <text start="302.849" dur="4.29">weather the weather was the problem</text>
  <text start="305.099" dur="3.75">storms this is why retail was declining</text>
  <text start="307.139" dur="3.571">and if you listen to the reports two</text>
  <text start="308.849" dur="3.181">three years ago this is what they used</text>
  <text start="310.71" dur="3.42">and then what happened was retail</text>
  <text start="312.03" dur="5.699">continually declined during the sunny</text>
  <text start="314.13" dur="5.98">days during the summer during the times</text>
  <text start="317.729" dur="5.231">when there is no bad weather whatsoever</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="4.62">even throughout the winter and they lost</text>
  <text start="322.96" dur="4.29">the narrative so they had to make</text>
  <text start="324.73" dur="4.5">something else up so they went to online</text>
  <text start="327.25" dur="4.62">and this was perfect because everyone</text>
  <text start="329.23" dur="3.9">knew Amazon and it was easy to do but</text>
  <text start="331.87" dur="4.98">again there&amp;#39;s other stores out there</text>
  <text start="333.13" dur="6.08">food stores other fast food restaurants</text>
  <text start="336.85" dur="5.52">this is not all going to online and</text>
  <text start="339.21" dur="6.94">Amazon is only a very small portion of</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="7.23">online sales compared to the retail</text>
  <text start="346.15" dur="5.37">industry itself but they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
  <text start="349.6" dur="4.83">to convince you this is why all this is</text>
  <text start="351.52" dur="4.86">happening know why this is why all this</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="4.74">is happening is because the everyday</text>
  <text start="356.38" dur="4.47">person well they either don&amp;#39;t have a job</text>
  <text start="359.17" dur="3.78">they either have a part-time job</text>
  <text start="360.85" dur="5.55">they don&amp;#39;t have savings and they can</text>
  <text start="362.95" dur="5.13">hardly or barely make ends meet and this</text>
  <text start="366.4" dur="4.29">is the real problem because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="368.08" dur="4.38">watching this decline for a very long</text>
  <text start="370.69" dur="5.37">time and we&amp;#39;re at the point where</text>
  <text start="372.46" dur="5.97">everything is falling apart now we</text>
  <text start="376.06" dur="4.59">understand that a lot of calculations</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="3.66">are being changed and we&amp;#39;re not talking</text>
  <text start="380.65" dur="3.48">about the little changes we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="382.09" dur="4.46">in-your-face changes like GDP and</text>
  <text start="384.13" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;s a reason for this now of course</text>
  <text start="386.55" dur="5.68">Trump government they&amp;#39;re all out there</text>
  <text start="389.71" dur="4.35">saying that the economy&amp;#39;s doing well the</text>
  <text start="392.23" dur="4.65">Fed is out there saying the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.06" dur="5.73">doing well and we need to understand why</text>
  <text start="396.88" dur="5.85">this is all happening because we know</text>
  <text start="399.79" dur="4.98">the economy&amp;#39;s not doing well and we know</text>
  <text start="402.73" dur="4.32">and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this that</text>
  <text start="404.77" dur="6">both sides want to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="5.73">now Trump came out and he outed the Fed</text>
  <text start="410.77" dur="4.05">and said listen you&amp;#39;re raising rates too</text>
  <text start="412.78" dur="4.41">fast but you know what you do what you</text>
  <text start="414.82" dur="5.13">feel is right that was the beginning</text>
  <text start="417.19" dur="5.55">phase of this he laid the groundwork so</text>
  <text start="419.95" dur="4.04">now the Fed well they decided not to</text>
  <text start="422.74" dur="3.87">raise rates</text>
  <text start="423.99" dur="6.42">remember they both want to gain the</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="7.41">narrative so what happened we are seeing</text>
  <text start="430.41" dur="6.52">the economic data it is all being</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="7.2">revised in a huge way a way that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="7.29">never seen before so what do we see we</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="7.38">see the US economic history it was</text>
  <text start="444.22" dur="5.91">rewritten in a shocking unbelievable way</text>
  <text start="448.6" dur="4.58">where all of a sudden people are out</text>
  <text start="450.13" dur="6.41">there wow we hit four percent GDP</text>
  <text start="453.18" dur="7.23">well other things were revised or</text>
  <text start="456.54" dur="6.75">manipulated in a huge way the annual</text>
  <text start="460.41" dur="5.75">savings rate was revised higher by 1.6</text>
  <text start="463.29" dur="5.28">percent on average since 2010 with the</text>
  <text start="466.16" dur="6.88">2017 u.s. savings rate doubling</text>
  <text start="468.57" dur="6.48">overnight from 3.4 percent to 6.7% now</text>
  <text start="473.04" dur="4.05">if we put these revisions into context</text>
  <text start="475.05" dur="4.86">the last comprehensive revision</text>
  <text start="477.09" dur="5.97">conducted in July 2015 only produced an</text>
  <text start="479.91" dur="6.15">upward reversion of 0.3% per year in</text>
  <text start="483.06" dur="5.76">fact the revision to the savings rate</text>
  <text start="486.06" dur="6.27">over the prior six months is the largest</text>
  <text start="488.82" dur="5.69">on record according to real-time data</text>
  <text start="492.33" dur="5.7">available from the st. Louis Fed since</text>
  <text start="494.51" dur="5.11">1997 now we know that none of these</text>
  <text start="498.03" dur="3.57">statistical revisions actually mean</text>
  <text start="499.62" dur="5.1">anything because both before and after</text>
  <text start="501.6" dur="4.56">the be a revision some 50% of Americans</text>
  <text start="504.72" dur="3.33">still don&amp;#39;t have a single dollar in</text>
  <text start="506.16" dur="3.75">savings and the only ones affected are</text>
  <text start="508.05" dur="3.99">those in the top percentiles of US</text>
  <text start="509.91" dur="5.22">society which means that you guessed it</text>
  <text start="512.04" dur="5.31">the rich get richer again and yet the</text>
  <text start="515.13" dur="3.99">statistical level which is the only one</text>
  <text start="517.35" dur="3.66">that matters for the Fed the latest</text>
  <text start="519.12" dur="3.81">numbers suggest households have been</text>
  <text start="521.01" dur="4.86">thrifty with their money during the</text>
  <text start="522.93" dur="5.55">recovery and with one flick of an Excel</text>
  <text start="525.87" dur="6.42">switch the secular decline in the US</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="6.51">personal savings rate was halted what</text>
  <text start="532.29" dur="5.7">does this mean for GDP well simple it is</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="5.49">revised sharply higher remember they</text>
  <text start="537.99" dur="4.83">revised it they added a trillion and now</text>
  <text start="540.48" dur="4.71">they adjusted the savings rate they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="542.82" dur="5.76">going to adjust the spending because</text>
  <text start="545.19" dur="4.86">remember 70 percent of GDP GDP is the</text>
  <text start="548.58" dur="4.5">spending of Americans so they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="7.92">to adjust this to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="553.08" dur="6.81">economy is growing so now we can expect</text>
  <text start="557.97" dur="4.14">the unemployment rate now also to</text>
  <text start="559.89" dur="6.33">decline to 3 point 5 percent by the end</text>
  <text start="562.11" dur="7.89">of 2018 and most likely hit 3 percent by</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="8.34">2020 because they changed all the</text>
  <text start="570" dur="8.13">calculations so the real question is why</text>
  <text start="574.56" dur="6.09">is well that&amp;#39;s being done why is this</text>
  <text start="578.13" dur="4.56">being done right now is it to really</text>
  <text start="580.65" dur="3.3">make the economy look good and to make</text>
  <text start="582.69" dur="3.77">everyone think that the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="583.95" dur="4.13">well when people are out there and</text>
  <text start="586.46" dur="3.66">doors are closing left and right the</text>
  <text start="588.08" dur="3.39">housing markets falling apart people are</text>
  <text start="590.12" dur="2.85">trying to sell their houses the prices</text>
  <text start="591.47" dur="4.56">are coming down they can&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="592.97" dur="5.46">why traffic is drying up people have two</text>
  <text start="596.03" dur="5.16">three four part-time jobs because we</text>
  <text start="598.43" dur="5.46">know that the multiple jobs that is</text>
  <text start="601.19" dur="6.81">increasing the full-time high-paying</text>
  <text start="603.89" dur="5.49">jobs are decreasing so what would be the</text>
  <text start="608" dur="4.05">whole purpose of this what would be the</text>
  <text start="609.38" dur="6.03">plan we&amp;#39;ll remember we need to go back</text>
  <text start="612.05" dur="4.89">to what we&amp;#39;ve been saying all along both</text>
  <text start="615.41" dur="4.2">sides are trying to gain the narrative</text>
  <text start="616.94" dur="6.66">the central banking community trumping</text>
  <text start="619.61" dur="5.67">the Patriots to put pressure on the Fed</text>
  <text start="623.6" dur="5.24">what do you have to do what do you want</text>
  <text start="625.28" dur="6.51">the Fed to do where they have no excuse</text>
  <text start="628.84" dur="5.17">to bring the system down something that</text>
  <text start="631.79" dur="4.23">you know will bring down the system now</text>
  <text start="634.01" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;ve calculated this already they</text>
  <text start="636.02" dur="5.97">know if we hit around 3% interest rates</text>
  <text start="639.95" dur="2.58">they know the system&amp;#39;s going to come</text>
  <text start="641.99" dur="3.39">down now</text>
  <text start="642.53" dur="6.78">they went back in time and all the way</text>
  <text start="645.38" dur="6.51">back to 1929 and they calculated the</text>
  <text start="649.31" dur="4.74">interest rates of when the economy came</text>
  <text start="651.89" dur="3.66">down and each time it was a little</text>
  <text start="654.05" dur="3.24">different depending on the economy at</text>
  <text start="655.55" dur="4.02">this point we&amp;#39;re at the lowest point</text>
  <text start="657.29" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;ve ever seen and since we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="659.57" dur="3.75">lowest point we&amp;#39;ve ever seen it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="660.92" dur="4.62">come up to 3% but in other times we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="663.32" dur="5.1">seen it in the 70s where interest rates</text>
  <text start="665.54" dur="5.31">were at 5% seventy-four where we saw</text>
  <text start="668.42" dur="6.48">interest rates at 10% 82 where we saw</text>
  <text start="670.85" dur="5.79">interest rates around 18% and then 87 we</text>
  <text start="674.9" dur="3.57">saw interest rates around 10 and then</text>

  <text start="688.46" dur="6.84">you do well it&amp;#39;s very simple you change</text>
  <text start="692" dur="6.87">the calculations you tell the Fed that</text>
  <text start="695.3" dur="5.76">GDP is 4% you tell the Fed we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="698.87" dur="5.01">three and a half or three percent</text>
  <text start="701.06" dur="5.43">unemployment you tell the Fed that</text>
  <text start="703.88" dur="5.07">people have a lot more money than that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="706.49" dur="7.68">that&amp;#39;s been reported so they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="708.95" dur="8.46">spend to force the Fed to raise the</text>
  <text start="714.17" dur="5.43">rates what are they going to say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="717.41" dur="2.77">waiting for the savings rate to get</text>

  <text start="728.79" dur="5.549">they just manipulated it all waiting for</text>
  <text start="731.43" dur="4.74">what what are they waiting for inflation</text>
  <text start="734.339" dur="6.091">they&amp;#39;ll just change the calculation</text>
  <text start="736.17" dur="7.289">they&amp;#39;re cornering the Fed right now so</text>
  <text start="740.43" dur="6.54">they make the move and raise interest</text>
  <text start="743.459" dur="6.841">rates faster then they will turn around</text>
  <text start="746.97" dur="4.92">as the Fed raises interest rates because</text>
  <text start="750.3" dur="3.42">remember the economy is great</text>
  <text start="751.89" dur="5.31">everything&amp;#39;s going smoothly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="753.72" dur="6.63">changing the Fed is changing the</text>

  <text start="762.45" dur="5.67">the economy at the same time don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="765.18" dur="3.39">forget that and the economy is falling</text>
  <text start="768.12" dur="3.42">apart</text>
  <text start="768.57" dur="5.04">hey we saw this back in 2008 prior to</text>
  <text start="771.54" dur="3.69">that what was the Fed doing raising</text>
  <text start="773.61" dur="3.21">interest rates when they raised the</text>
  <text start="775.23" dur="4.14">interest rates what happened all those</text>
  <text start="776.82" dur="4.44">people with adjustable rate mortgages in</text>
  <text start="779.37" dur="3.18">California they couldn&amp;#39;t lock in they</text>
  <text start="781.26" dur="2.519">couldn&amp;#39;t afford the homes they walked</text>
  <text start="782.55" dur="3.75">out all the speculators</text>
  <text start="783.779" dur="3.631">they dumped real estate what do you</text>
  <text start="786.3" dur="3.69">think is gonna happen this time</text>
  <text start="787.41" dur="5.13">all those individuals that have</text>
  <text start="789.99" dur="5.88">adjustable rate mortgages all those</text>
  <text start="792.54" dur="5.13">individuals that have or looking to</text>
  <text start="795.87" dur="4.8">purchase a home are completely knocked</text>
  <text start="797.67" dur="4.41">out of the real estate market those</text>
  <text start="800.67" dur="3.48">people that were going to sell their</text>
  <text start="802.08" dur="3.449">homes as prices come down and rates move</text>
  <text start="804.15" dur="5.34">up they&amp;#39;re going to take them off the</text>
  <text start="805.529" dur="6">market and people well in reality they</text>
  <text start="809.49" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t have savings they&amp;#39;re not gonna go</text>
  <text start="811.529" dur="3.93">out and spend as we can see in the</text>
  <text start="813.81" dur="5.31">retail market things are completely</text>
  <text start="815.459" dur="5.611">falling apart but the Fed has to raise</text>
  <text start="819.12" dur="5.36">rates because all the statistical</text>
  <text start="821.07" dur="6.15">information is exactly what they wanted</text>
  <text start="824.48" dur="4.66">the Fed is cornered right now this is</text>
  <text start="827.22" dur="6.54">all being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="829.14" dur="8.22">to push the system to the edge this is</text>
  <text start="833.76" dur="4.65">the plan and it&amp;#39;s unfolding right in</text>
  <text start="837.36" dur="4.349">front of our eyes we can see it</text>
  <text start="838.41" dur="4.53">happening and the purpose of this making</text>
  <text start="841.709" dur="2.491">look and I know a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="842.94" dur="2.97">there saying well Trump came into power</text>
  <text start="844.2" dur="4.65">the economy is great everything is great</text>
  <text start="845.91" dur="6.6">yes this is what people are seeing on</text>
  <text start="848.85" dur="5.01">the surface but what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="852.51" dur="4.38">behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="853.86" dur="5.87">is that the Fed is going to be blamed</text>
  <text start="856.89" dur="4.98">for bringing down this incredible</text>
  <text start="859.73" dur="5.74">economy even though it&amp;#39;s fake we all</text>
  <text start="861.87" dur="4.709">know it&amp;#39;s fake it&amp;#39;s an illusion but no</text>
  <text start="865.47" dur="2.16">one&amp;#39;s gonna come out the mainstream</text>
  <text start="866.579" dur="3.081">media&amp;#39;s not gonna come out and say this</text>
  <text start="867.63" dur="4.949">wasn&amp;#39;t a fake illusionary economy</text>
  <text start="869.66" dur="5.53">because it was all based on Obama it was</text>
  <text start="872.579" dur="4.291">all based on the Fed and with the Fed</text>
  <text start="875.19" dur="3.72">telling you that the economy strong</text>
  <text start="876.87" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re not gonna come out and all of a</text>
  <text start="878.91" dur="4.799">sudden say the economy was an illusion</text>
  <text start="881.49" dur="3.839">they might say the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="883.709" dur="4.94">well they&amp;#39;re gonna try to push that</text>
  <text start="885.329" dur="5.88">angle but it&amp;#39;s going to be too late and</text>
  <text start="888.649" dur="4.331">we already see the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="891.209" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re already starting to push that</text>
  <text start="892.98" dur="4.38">angle that Real Estate&amp;#39;s not doing well</text>
  <text start="894.959" dur="3.931">what we know it&amp;#39;s not doing well but the</text>
  <text start="897.36" dur="2.7">everyday American doesn&amp;#39;t really know</text>
  <text start="898.89" dur="3.03">this and they&amp;#39;re trying to blame this on</text>
  <text start="900.06" dur="3.66">Trump but what Trump is doing in the</text>
  <text start="901.92" dur="4.47">Patriots they&amp;#39;re trying to boost this</text>
  <text start="903.72" dur="5.489">economy to a place that we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="906.39" dur="5.43">it before to force the Fed to raise the</text>
  <text start="909.209" dur="3.781">rates to have the system come down turn</text>
  <text start="911.82" dur="5.28">around and say the only thing that</text>
  <text start="912.99" dur="6.69">changed is you raising the rates we</text>
  <text start="917.1" dur="4.109">received this information that the</text>
  <text start="919.68" dur="3.93">economy strong you even said it in your</text>
  <text start="921.209" dur="3.661">notes your minutes the economy strong</text>
  <text start="923.61" dur="3.18">and you said it was great</text>
  <text start="924.87" dur="4.469">time to raise rates because you know</text>
  <text start="926.79" dur="7.83">what you&amp;#39;re doing and the economy failed</text>
  <text start="929.339" dur="7.171">why he&amp;#39;s going to corner the Fed and</text>
  <text start="934.62" dur="4.02">most likely go to after inaud it and</text>
  <text start="936.51" dur="4.5">then take control of the Fed like we</text>
  <text start="938.64" dur="4.71">discussed in previous reports and when</text>
  <text start="941.01" dur="5.189">the economy comes down for those who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="943.35" dur="4.95">been preparing it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot</text>
  <text start="946.199" dur="4.531">softer landing for those who are</text>
  <text start="948.3" dur="3.63">completely in the dark it&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="950.73" dur="3.479">little bit more difficult not as</text>
  <text start="951.93" dur="4.83">difficult if the central bank had their</text>
  <text start="954.209" dur="4.921">way and controlled the narrative but we</text>
  <text start="956.76" dur="4.67">see what&amp;#39;s happening here if Trump and</text>
  <text start="959.13" dur="5.43">the Patriots control the narrative the</text>
  <text start="961.43" dur="5.98">transition is not going to be as hard as</text>
  <text start="964.56" dur="4.35">the central bank transition because they</text>
  <text start="967.41" dur="2.91">don&amp;#39;t care if people get wiped out they</text>
  <text start="968.91" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t care if people die they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="970.32" dur="3.69">about any of that stuff and we see right</text>
  <text start="972.93" dur="3.87">now that we are going to be going</text>
  <text start="974.01" dur="4.38">through this transition and people have</text>
  <text start="976.8" dur="3.3">to be ready and prepared because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="978.39" dur="3.18">gonna go through a period of time where</text>
  <text start="980.1" dur="2.549">a lot is going to freeze up because when</text>
  <text start="981.57" dur="3.269">you&amp;#39;re going from one system to another</text>
  <text start="982.649" dur="3.451">it just doesn&amp;#39;t happen with a snap of a</text>
  <text start="984.839" dur="2.161">finger and everything just goes smoothly</text>
  <text start="986.1" dur="3.33">I mean we were</text>
  <text start="987" dur="3.87">coming off the gold standard in 1970</text>
  <text start="989.43" dur="4.8">going on to the petrodollar system</text>

  <text start="996" dur="4.68">jobs in the 70s there were difficult</text>

  <text start="1000.68" dur="4.38">coming off gold with hardly any debt now</text>
  <text start="1003.11" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;re on the opposite end we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="1005.06" dur="6.51">off a system where it&amp;#39;s at its end stage</text>
  <text start="1008.66" dur="5.01">where we have too much debt there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1011.57" dur="4.44">not the dollars not backed by anyone and</text>
  <text start="1013.67" dur="5.49">countries are going to lose faith in it</text>
