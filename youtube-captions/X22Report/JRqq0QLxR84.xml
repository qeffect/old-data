  <text start="101.7" dur="4.529">carefully at what Trump is doing that</text>
  <text start="103.619" dur="6.961">with the central bank you start to</text>
  <text start="106.229" dur="8.611">realize that he&amp;#39;s positioning them so</text>
  <text start="110.58" dur="7.999">they&amp;#39;re completely obsolete think about</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="6.72">what he&amp;#39;s doing think about his strategy</text>
  <text start="118.579" dur="7.15">think about what the central bank does</text>
  <text start="121.56" dur="6.66">think about their mandate where they</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="5.28">need to create no inflation they need to</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="6.03">keep the prices stable and they need to</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="6.121">keep everyone employed but what is the</text>
  <text start="134.25" dur="6.03">central thing been doing everything but</text>
  <text start="137.13" dur="6.41">that what is the central bank doing now</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="5.519">what is the central bank do altogether</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="5.039">well they&amp;#39;ve been controlling interest</text>
  <text start="145.799" dur="6.361">rates and they&amp;#39;ll own the government</text>
  <text start="148.579" dur="6.97">currency with interest attached now</text>
  <text start="152.16" dur="6.45">think about what he&amp;#39;s doing and we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="155.549" dur="7.261">talking about that in just a moment but</text>
  <text start="158.61" dur="5.64">first I want to talk about the trade war</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="4.11">the mainstream media out there saying</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="5.64">that we&amp;#39;re in this incredible trade war</text>
  <text start="166.92" dur="5.72">and the Dow is going down because of</text>
  <text start="169.89" dur="5.04">fear and all of this other stuff</text>
  <text start="172.64" dur="3.459">actually if you look today it did</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="1.65">exactly what we thought was going to</text>
  <text start="176.099" dur="4.591">happen</text>
  <text start="176.58" dur="7.26">we saw a dead cat bounce the markets</text>
  <text start="180.69" dur="7.65">starting to move back up gold is now</text>
  <text start="183.84" dur="7.95">over 1500 and guess what Trump is making</text>
  <text start="188.34" dur="5.399">the case to have the Federal Reserve cut</text>
  <text start="191.79" dur="6.12">interest rates even further but before</text>
  <text start="193.739" dur="6.901">we get to that let&amp;#39;s talk about what</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="4.53">Trump is doing with China Trump right</text>
  <text start="200.64" dur="3.96">now has the upper hand when it comes to</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="7.019">China and the tariffs now we know that</text>
  <text start="204.6" dur="7.59">china is retaliating through devaluing</text>
  <text start="209.459" dur="6.691">their currency this is the only thing</text>
  <text start="212.19" dur="7.829">they have left remember China doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="6.03">really buy that many American goods so</text>
  <text start="220.019" dur="5.19">they really can&amp;#39;t retaliate in that way</text>
  <text start="222.18" dur="5.73">with tariffs it just won&amp;#39;t work this is</text>
  <text start="225.209" dur="6.141">why they resorted to devaluing their</text>
  <text start="227.91" dur="5.85">currency currency manipulation and</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="4.96">they&amp;#39;re doing this because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="3.96">trying to fight against what Trump is</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="6.12">doing they&amp;#39;re trying to keep their</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="7.44">system alive but it could backfire the</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="5.46">PBOC s move to allow the RMB to weaken</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="5.04">against the dollar offsets the sting of</text>
  <text start="247.89" dur="6.03">tariffs on Chinese exports but it</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="7.439">carries two important risks for China</text>
  <text start="253.92" dur="6.539">first the United States retaliates to</text>
  <text start="257.639" dur="6.15">the currency devaluation which is</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="6.571">exactly what happened when Trump and the</text>
  <text start="263.789" dur="6.421">US Treasury acted to officially label</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="6.42">China a currency manipulator this is the</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="6.84">first time since the 90s hmm I wonder if</text>
  <text start="273.45" dur="6.18">Trump actually positioned all of this so</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="6.51">they would actually come out and say</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="7.44">they are a currency manipulator I think</text>
  <text start="283.56" dur="5.7">this was part of his plan now this</text>
  <text start="287.07" dur="5.37">action really doesn&amp;#39;t have any immediate</text>
  <text start="289.26" dur="5.79">consequences but it acts as a warning to</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="3.59">China and can open the door to future</text>
  <text start="295.05" dur="3.53">penalties on</text>
  <text start="296.03" dur="5.7">these imports to America the second risk</text>
  <text start="298.58" dur="5.52">is that the PBOC is unable to stop a</text>
  <text start="301.73" dur="4.77">further RMB slide which would cost</text>
  <text start="304.1" dur="4.2">capital outflows and tight money in</text>
  <text start="306.5" dur="4.23">China which would crash</text>
  <text start="308.3" dur="7.56">China&amp;#39;s all-important property market</text>
  <text start="310.73" dur="8.91">and thus its economy Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.86" dur="8.25">maneuvering to place China in a corner</text>
  <text start="319.64" dur="7.47">and while he&amp;#39;s doing this he&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="7.02">sure that he has the upper hand and he</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="5.78">has all the leverage the economic</text>
  <text start="331.13" dur="5.57">relationship between America and China</text>
  <text start="332.89" dur="6.88">really is unfair and we&amp;#39;ve known this</text>
  <text start="336.7" dur="7.35">we&amp;#39;ve known the past administration&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="8.43">the deep state they&amp;#39;ve maneuvered it and</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="6.61">created this monster and when Trump took</text>
  <text start="348.2" dur="5.1">office the average US tariff on Chinese</text>
  <text start="350.66" dur="4.73">goods was around 3% and the average</text>
  <text start="353.3" dur="4.71">Chinese tariff was around 10% a</text>
  <text start="355.39" dur="5.05">multitude of hidden rules restricted</text>
  <text start="358.01" dur="6.39">American firms ability to do business in</text>
  <text start="360.44" dur="6.33">China worse China has long had quasi</text>
  <text start="364.4" dur="5.04">official policy of stealing US</text>
  <text start="366.77" dur="5.1">intellectual property US firms that seek</text>
  <text start="369.44" dur="5.1">to operate in China they are forced to</text>
  <text start="371.87" dur="5.34">partner with a Chinese competitor via</text>
  <text start="374.54" dur="5.07">joint venture requirements that</text>
  <text start="377.21" dur="5.85">competitor gets to see their business</text>
  <text start="379.61" dur="6.3">practices and trade secrets and again a</text>
  <text start="383.06" dur="5.46">license to operate in China American</text>
  <text start="385.91" dur="5.55">firms are forced to hand intellectual</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="4.98">property to Chinese officials often</text>
  <text start="391.46" dur="4.95">these officials give these corporate</text>
  <text start="393.5" dur="5.94">secrets to local Chinese companies now</text>
  <text start="396.41" dur="3.83">why is this I mean this was here before</text>
  <text start="399.44" dur="3.45">Trump</text>
  <text start="400.24" dur="6.07">what were the other administration&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="402.89" dur="6.77">doing well they weren&amp;#39;t working in the</text>
  <text start="406.31" dur="6.51">best interest of the people were they</text>
  <text start="409.66" dur="7.56">how about when a Chinese company comes</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="9.12">to America does America do this to China</text>
  <text start="417.22" dur="7.51">absolutely not right now there are</text>
  <text start="421.94" dur="6.93">almost 1,000 separate FBI investigations</text>
  <text start="424.73" dur="7.08">into Chinese corporate espionage</text>
  <text start="428.87" dur="5.24">at least one in all 50 US states so</text>
  <text start="431.81" dur="6.59">what&amp;#39;s trump&amp;#39;s mission to fix all this</text>
  <text start="434.11" dur="6.46">well he has light hyzer and a team and</text>
  <text start="438.4" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re trying to work this out with</text>
  <text start="440.57" dur="5.46">China they&amp;#39;re looking to increase</text>
  <text start="444.14" dur="4.89">intellectual property protection</text>
  <text start="446.03" dur="4.62">enforcement and protectionism measures</text>
  <text start="449.03" dur="4.17">aimed at restricting the import of you</text>
  <text start="450.65" dur="3.74">as Goods and this is among many other</text>
  <text start="453.2" dur="4.86">things</text>
  <text start="454.39" dur="8.26">it is completely lopsided right down and</text>
  <text start="458.06" dur="7.62">that&amp;#39;s why Trump is maneuvering to put</text>
  <text start="462.65" dur="6.3">China in the corner to make them do what</text>
  <text start="465.68" dur="5.1">we want and he has them manipulating</text>
  <text start="468.95" dur="4.65">their currency which allowed the United</text>
  <text start="470.78" dur="6.48">States to call them a or designate them</text>
  <text start="473.6" dur="7.77">as a currency manipulator now Trump is</text>
  <text start="477.26" dur="7.2">going to manipulate the US currency now</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="7.05">this has many different agendas one of</text>
  <text start="484.46" dur="6.15">them is to to get China to say okay we</text>
  <text start="488.42" dur="6.51">give we&amp;#39;re gonna make we&amp;#39;re gonna even</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="8.34">things out the other is to drive the</text>
  <text start="494.93" dur="9.27">central bank to be completely obsolete</text>
  <text start="498.95" dur="9.57">and create a crisis to move us into a</text>
  <text start="504.2" dur="7.43">new economic system now we know that the</text>
  <text start="508.52" dur="6.21">Fed cut the rates by a quarter point and</text>
  <text start="511.63" dur="6.04">we know this is not what Trump wanted he</text>
  <text start="514.73" dur="6.36">wanted a lot more Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="517.67" dur="6.9">following three more central bank&amp;#39;s cut</text>
  <text start="521.09" dur="5.22">rates our problem is not China we are</text>
  <text start="524.57" dur="4.29">stronger than ever money is pouring into</text>
  <text start="526.31" dur="4.71">the US while China is losing companies</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="4.61">by the thousands to other countries and</text>
  <text start="531.02" dur="5.9">their currency is under siege our</text>
  <text start="533.47" dur="6.94">problem is the Federal Reserve that is</text>
  <text start="536.92" dur="5.47">too proud to admit their mistake of</text>
  <text start="540.41" dur="5.52">acting too fast and tightening too much</text>
  <text start="542.39" dur="5.37">and that I was right they must cut rates</text>
  <text start="545.93" dur="3.57">bigger and faster and stop their</text>
  <text start="547.76" dur="5.34">ridiculous quantitative tightening now</text>
  <text start="549.5" dur="7.02">yield curve is at too wide a margin and</text>
  <text start="553.1" dur="5.4">no inflation incompetence is a terrible</text>
  <text start="556.52" dur="5.04">thing to watch especially when things</text>
  <text start="558.5" dur="3.91">could be taken care of so easily we will</text>
  <text start="561.56" dur="3.069">win anyway</text>
  <text start="562.41" dur="4.979">but would be much easier if they fed</text>
  <text start="564.629" dur="4.89">understood which they don&amp;#39;t that we are</text>
  <text start="567.389" dur="6.51">competing against other countries all of</text>
  <text start="569.519" dur="7.141">whom want to do well at our expense now</text>
  <text start="573.899" dur="7.19">if you notice he&amp;#39;s not blaming China</text>
  <text start="576.66" dur="8.19">he&amp;#39;s blaming the Fed once again and</text>
  <text start="581.089" dur="6.911">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that as Trump</text>
  <text start="584.85" dur="4.789">continually bashes the Fed what is</text>
  <text start="588" dur="5.91">happening right now</text>
  <text start="589.639" dur="6.851">well it looks like the odds of the Fed</text>
  <text start="593.91" dur="5.549">cutting rates they&amp;#39;re going up faster</text>
  <text start="596.49" dur="5.899">and faster and it looks like the Fed</text>
  <text start="599.459" dur="6.24">might be cutting rates a lot sooner than</text>
  <text start="602.389" dur="6.25">everyone thinks and we do believe that</text>
  <text start="605.699" dur="5.43">stimulus will be coming a lot sooner</text>
  <text start="608.639" dur="5.281">than everyone believes now think about</text>
  <text start="611.129" dur="5.01">what Trump is doing as the Fed</text>
  <text start="613.92" dur="4.56">continually lowers rates and finally</text>
  <text start="616.139" dur="5.221">gets to zero maybe we&amp;#39;ll go into</text>
  <text start="618.48" dur="7.14">negative territory who knows what</text>
  <text start="621.36" dur="7.11">happens with the central bank well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="625.62" dur="6.569">already at zero so the government can</text>
  <text start="628.47" dur="6.21">now borrow money with no interest</text>
  <text start="632.189" dur="6.45">attached it&amp;#39;s like the government</text>
  <text start="634.68" dur="8.82">creating their currency by themselves</text>
  <text start="638.639" dur="9.331">right Trump doesn&amp;#39;t have to call on the</text>
  <text start="643.5" dur="8.6">Federal Reserve to do anything I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="647.97" dur="7.77">need you now we&amp;#39;re already at zero now I</text>
  <text start="652.1" dur="7.51">can do what I need to do this is the</text>
  <text start="655.74" dur="9.12">beginning stages of making the central</text>
  <text start="659.61" dur="7.56">bank completely obsolete think about</text>
  <text start="664.86" dur="5.19">this for a second if there was no</text>
  <text start="667.17" dur="5.159">central bank with the government be</text>
  <text start="670.05" dur="6.539">creating their own currency without</text>
  <text start="672.329" dur="8.581">interest attached yes and what Trump is</text>
  <text start="676.589" dur="7.73">doing he&amp;#39;s pushing the central bank to</text>
  <text start="680.91" dur="8.19">the side so he can operate independently</text>
  <text start="684.319" dur="8.681">and do what he needs to do for the</text>
  <text start="689.1" dur="6.37">economy for this transition and remember</text>
  <text start="693" dur="7.11">he&amp;#39;s controlling the narrative</text>
  <text start="695.47" dur="8.25">controlling what&amp;#39;s gonna come next and</text>
  <text start="700.11" dur="7.12">once he has everything where he wants it</text>
  <text start="703.72" dur="6.3">and once he shows the people and the</text>
  <text start="707.23" dur="6.54">world that look with the central bank</text>
  <text start="710.02" dur="6.81">doing nothing we can really do some</text>
  <text start="713.77" dur="5.49">incredible things with the economy now</text>
  <text start="716.83" dur="6.21">the central bank decided they want to</text>
  <text start="719.26" dur="6.9">raise rates and they already started and</text>
  <text start="723.04" dur="5.34">they want to tighten now this is not</text>
  <text start="726.16" dur="4.35">going to be good for the economy we were</text>
  <text start="728.38" dur="5.73">doing so well why would they be doing</text>
  <text start="730.51" dur="6.3">this and this is when Trump is really</text>
  <text start="734.11" dur="5.16">gonna hit the Fed really hard because as</text>
  <text start="736.81" dur="4.95">you can see he&amp;#39;s been continually</text>
  <text start="739.27" dur="5.31">contradicting continually calling them</text>
  <text start="741.76" dur="6.81">out like no other president he is</text>
