  <text start="112.69" dur="6.359">at the blockchain to use it in many</text>
  <text start="116.229" dur="4.591">different areas one being voting because</text>
  <text start="119.049" dur="4.771">you have to remember this is a ledger</text>
  <text start="120.82" dur="5.49">system it&amp;#39;s a truth based system and you</text>
  <text start="123.82" dur="5.85">can track everything down this is why</text>
  <text start="126.31" dur="6.36">when the central bank&amp;#39;s come out and say</text>
  <text start="129.67" dur="6.09">that terrorists are using cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="132.67" dur="5.879">using the blockchain they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="135.76" dur="4.5">funds and using it well it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="138.549" dur="5.22">difficult because you can track all</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="5.509">these funds not like cash or the money</text>
  <text start="143.769" dur="5.551">laundering that goes on in the big banks</text>
  <text start="145.769" dur="6.901">but cryptocurrency the blockchain system</text>
  <text start="149.32" dur="5.55">it is based on a ledger system</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="4.99">diversified around the world</text>
  <text start="154.87" dur="4.83">decentralized around the world and you</text>
  <text start="157.66" dur="5.04">can pretty much track everything that</text>
  <text start="159.7" dur="6.03">goes on and we see right now Switzerland</text>
  <text start="162.7" dur="8.19">they decided to use the blockchain for</text>
  <text start="165.73" dur="7.38">voting and the city of Zug completed its</text>
  <text start="170.89" dur="3.91">first trial municipal vote using</text>
  <text start="173.11" dur="4.36">blockchain</text>
  <text start="174.8" dur="5.46">the vote was held using a trial ID</text>
  <text start="177.47" dur="5.4">system CID City authorities used the</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="5.61">system since 2017 to issue digital</text>
  <text start="182.87" dur="6.06">identities to residents they used the</text>
  <text start="185.87" dur="6.11">blockchain technology to handle the</text>
  <text start="188.93" dur="6.45">entire voting system now sugg is a</text>
  <text start="191.98" dur="5.56">cryptocurrency and blockchain hotspot in</text>
  <text start="195.38" dur="4.59">Switzerland it&amp;#39;s right outside of Zurich</text>

  <text start="286.25" dur="5.25">area and you can choose what you want to</text>

  <text start="291.5" dur="6.68">released their job information and ADP</text>
  <text start="295.88" dur="5.34">printed that the US economy added around</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="4.989">177 thousand jobs in June now they</text>
  <text start="301.22" dur="4.94">missed expectations right now for the</text>
  <text start="303.169" dur="5.661">fourth straight month in a row</text>
  <text start="306.16" dur="5.58">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="308.83" dur="4.86">there trying to convince us and this is</text>
  <text start="311.74" dur="4.62">coming from Mark Zandi chief economist</text>
  <text start="313.69" dur="5.67">at Moody&amp;#39;s Analytics the big problem</text>
  <text start="316.36" dur="5.55">right now is that they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="5.85">qualified workers as a shortage of</text>
  <text start="321.91" dur="5.13">workers right now now this is very</text>
  <text start="325.21" dur="4.08">interesting and we discussed this before</text>
  <text start="327.04" dur="4.65">if there&amp;#39;s such a shortage and they</text>
  <text start="329.29" dur="5.96">can&amp;#39;t find qualified workers salaries</text>
  <text start="331.69" dur="5.79">would be skyrocketing right now because</text>
  <text start="335.25" dur="5.11">again it has to do with demand and</text>
  <text start="337.48" dur="6.54">supply supply and demand and if you</text>
  <text start="340.36" dur="6.18">don&amp;#39;t have the workers guess what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="344.02" dur="4.74">gonna have to raise the salary to find</text>
  <text start="346.54" dur="4.98">those qualified workers if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="348.76" dur="5.37">raise the salary is there really a</text>
  <text start="351.52" dur="4.67">shortage we saw this in the past when</text>
  <text start="354.13" dur="5.43">you couldn&amp;#39;t find the right people</text>
  <text start="356.19" dur="6.64">salaries went up we&amp;#39;re not seeing that</text>
  <text start="359.56" dur="5.34">right now which is strange in itself and</text>
  <text start="362.83" dur="4.89">we discussed this in previous reports</text>
  <text start="364.9" dur="6.36">which tells us something is wrong with</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="5.76">what they&amp;#39;re telling us and once again a</text>
  <text start="371.26" dur="4.89">lot of these numbers are manipulated</text>
  <text start="373.48" dur="5.04">when we look at the retail industry we</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="7.37">see that their retail apocalypse well it</text>
  <text start="378.52" dur="7.8">is continuing now we know that toys-r-us</text>
  <text start="383.52" dur="4.12">they just went out of business 33,000</text>
  <text start="386.32" dur="3.26">people be looking for business and that</text>
  <text start="387.64" dur="4.95">means there&amp;#39;s are going to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="389.58" dur="5.74">commercial real estate that is</text>
  <text start="392.59" dur="5.1">completely vacant and we&amp;#39;ll get into the</text>
  <text start="395.32" dur="3.03">vacancy and how they figure this out in</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="3.68">just a bit</text>
  <text start="398.35" dur="5.46">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that 2018</text>
  <text start="401.37" dur="5.71">looks like it&amp;#39;s going to beat the record</text>
  <text start="403.81" dur="5.64">that has set last year for the number of</text>
  <text start="407.08" dur="3.99">store closures in a single year if the</text>
  <text start="409.45" dur="3.33">second half continues to grow with new</text>
  <text start="411.07" dur="4.2">announcements at the rate has been</text>
  <text start="412.78" dur="6.11">growing now the report is saying that</text>
  <text start="415.27" dur="7.85">they&amp;#39;re expecting around 12,000 stores</text>
  <text start="418.89" dur="8.86">to close this year versus last year&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="7.12">9,000 so the retail apocalypse has not</text>
  <text start="427.75" dur="4.919">ended we&amp;#39;re just at the midway point</text>
  <text start="430.24" dur="5.38">right now and it looks like it might</text>
  <text start="432.669" dur="5.981">beat out last year&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.62" dur="4.59">now when we look at these vacancies we</text>
  <text start="438.65" dur="4.77">know that there&amp;#39;s a lot of stores that</text>
  <text start="440.21" dur="6.66">have closed we see that Claire&amp;#39;s Nine</text>
  <text start="443.42" dur="7.68">West Banton Toys R Us Charming Charlie</text>
  <text start="446.87" dur="9.81">True Religion route 21 Gymboree Payless</text>
  <text start="451.1" dur="8.37">HH Greg Gander Mountain we see direct by</text>
  <text start="456.68" dur="6.42">American Apparel Golf Smith</text>
  <text start="459.47" dur="5.97">Aeropostale PacSun Hancock Fabrics</text>
  <text start="463.1" dur="4.83">American Apparel Quicksilver and the</text>
  <text start="465.44" dur="4.47">list goes on and on and on and we see</text>
  <text start="467.93" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s been a lot of store closures and</text>
  <text start="469.91" dur="6.9">there&amp;#39;s going to be even more so when we</text>
  <text start="473.3" dur="6.57">look at the vacancies we see that there</text>
  <text start="476.81" dur="5.85">is a lot of retail space that is out</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="4.5">there and of course Toys R Us as we know</text>
  <text start="482.66" dur="4.38">closed down and we can see that babies</text>
  <text start="484.37" dur="5.12">babies r us toys r us and all the stores</text>
  <text start="487.04" dur="5.22">associated with this there now empty and</text>
  <text start="489.49" dur="7.12">when we look at this we see that if we</text>
  <text start="492.26" dur="7.17">just combine Banton with Toys R Us we</text>
  <text start="496.61" dur="6.72">see there&amp;#39;s nearly 6 million square feet</text>
  <text start="499.43" dur="6.63">of retail space and every square inch is</text>
  <text start="503.33" dur="4.98">now being vacated now we need to take a</text>
  <text start="506.06" dur="4.89">closer look at these numbers because</text>
  <text start="508.31" dur="4.29">these numbers are deceptive and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="510.95" dur="4.05">almost like the unemployment numbers the</text>
  <text start="512.6" dur="5.73">GDP numbers and every other number that</text>
  <text start="515" dur="6.9">we look at because when you count</text>
  <text start="518.33" dur="7.14">something as vacant it&amp;#39;s only when the</text>
  <text start="521.9" dur="5.44">landlord tries to fill it with another</text>
  <text start="525.47" dur="5.11">retailer</text>
  <text start="527.34" dur="6.36">stores that emptied out and became</text>
  <text start="530.58" dur="5.58">zombie stores in zombie malls or the</text>
  <text start="533.7" dur="4.77">Toys R Us stores in bad areas with zero</text>
  <text start="536.16" dur="6.45">hopes of finding another retail tenant</text>
  <text start="538.47" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re not being counted as vacant</text>
  <text start="542.61" dur="5.82">retail space because they&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="5.15">being marketed as retail space and the</text>
  <text start="548.43" dur="5.07">square footage of that retail space</text>
  <text start="550.4" dur="7.9">disappears from their vacant retail</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="6.27">space stats so when we look at stats and</text>
  <text start="558.3" dur="5.46">we look at all these different types of</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="6.42">numbers they&amp;#39;re finding ways to</text>
  <text start="563.76" dur="5.28">calculate this to make it look like</text>
  <text start="566.19" dur="7.44">everything is a lot better than it</text>
  <text start="569.04" dur="6.48">really is so when we see that Toys R Us</text>
  <text start="573.63" dur="3.18">is closing down and we see Ballentine</text>
  <text start="575.52" dur="2.61">and all these stores closing down and</text>
  <text start="576.81" dur="4.38">the corporate media comes on there and</text>
  <text start="578.13" dur="5.49">says wow vacancies that really hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="581.19" dur="5.37">affected the vacant retail space well</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="4.65">you know how they calculated the number</text>
  <text start="586.56" dur="2.91">because most of time people go well this</text>
  <text start="588.27" dur="3.54">doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense but I have all</text>
  <text start="589.47" dur="3.93">these stores closing and the amount of</text>
  <text start="591.81" dur="3.54">retail space that are vacant it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="593.4" dur="5.13">going up it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="595.35" dur="5.28">now you know why so when we look at this</text>
  <text start="598.53" dur="4.71">we see that this whole thing again is</text>
  <text start="600.63" dur="5.31">fake phony and false so as more and more</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="5.73">stores closed down and guess what you</text>
  <text start="605.94" dur="6.54">most likely will not see the number of</text>
  <text start="608.97" dur="8.49">retail space the vacancies go up because</text>
  <text start="612.48" dur="8.19">remember the only time they count as</text>
  <text start="617.46" dur="6.81">vacant is when the landlord tries to</text>
  <text start="620.67" dur="6.27">fill it with another retailer stores</text>
  <text start="624.27" dur="6.39">that emptied out and become zombie</text>
  <text start="626.94" dur="6.33">stores in these zombie malls and they</text>
  <text start="630.66" dur="5.52">have no hope of finding another retailer</text>
  <text start="633.27" dur="4.86">to come in well they&amp;#39;re not counted</text>
  <text start="636.18" dur="4.23">because they&amp;#39;re no longer being marked</text>
  <text start="638.13" dur="4.32">as retail space this is how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="640.41" dur="3.54">getting around all of this and making it</text>
  <text start="642.45" dur="1.92">seem like it&amp;#39;s a lot better than it</text>
  <text start="643.95" dur="3.21">really is</text>
  <text start="644.37" dur="5.01">but it&amp;#39;s a lot worse than everyone</text>
  <text start="647.16" dur="4.95">thinks same thing with the housing</text>
  <text start="649.38" dur="5.25">market I mean we had hedge funds and</text>
  <text start="652.11" dur="5.07">investment companies purchase homes keep</text>
  <text start="654.63" dur="5.05">them off the market rent them if they</text>
  <text start="657.18" dur="4.75">can if not do not sell them we have bang</text>
  <text start="659.68" dur="3.42">in for clothes because then they would</text>
  <text start="661.93" dur="2.219">have to put him back on the market so</text>
  <text start="663.1" dur="3.239">they just let the people live in the</text>
  <text start="664.149" dur="4.891">house even though they were foreclosed</text>
  <text start="666.339" dur="5.281">it was nice for the people but this way</text>
  <text start="669.04" dur="4.59">they could push the bubbles up aboard</text>
  <text start="671.62" dur="4.43">are we seeing right now we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="673.63" dur="4.44">mortgage applications they&amp;#39;re falling</text>
  <text start="676.05" dur="4.39">refinancing hits a twenty year low</text>
  <text start="678.07" dur="4.32">people aren&amp;#39;t going out and purchasing</text>
  <text start="680.44" dur="5.49">the homes it&amp;#39;s all starting to fall</text>
  <text start="682.39" dur="4.71">apart and we know that the corporate</text>
  <text start="685.93" dur="4.29">media the mainstream media right now</text>
  <text start="687.1" dur="5.67">they are prepared and ready to push the</text>
  <text start="690.22" dur="4.59">propaganda and we saw out of the Wall</text>
  <text start="692.77" dur="4.86">Street Journal we saw out of the New</text>
