  <text start="30.73" dur="4.74">hi and welcome you listening to the X</text>
  <text start="33.97" dur="4.35">when he chill rapport my name is dave</text>
  <text start="35.47" dur="5.97">and this is episode 1097 a and today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="38.32" dur="5.52">date is october 10th 2016 and the</text>
  <text start="41.44" dur="4.71">totally episode is that european banking</text>
  <text start="43.84" dur="5.01">crisis is much worse than the central</text>
  <text start="46.15" dur="6">bankers led on let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="48.85" dur="5.4">economic collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="52.15" dur="7.08">have been watching the economic</text>
  <text start="54.25" dur="7.14">indicators since 2008 and we&amp;#39;re showing</text>
  <text start="59.23" dur="6.18">that a lot of these economic indicators</text>
  <text start="61.39" dur="6.06">are worse than when we were in the Great</text>
  <text start="65.41" dur="5.01">Recession now we&amp;#39;ve never ended the</text>
  <text start="67.45" dur="6.99">Great Recession all the central bankers</text>
  <text start="70.42" dur="5.729">have done is extended out because if you</text>
  <text start="74.44" dur="4.41">look at what they&amp;#39;ve done they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="76.149" dur="5.041">propped up the banks propped up the</text>
  <text start="78.85" dur="7.59">stock market suppress the precious</text>
  <text start="81.19" dur="6.959">metals market and that&amp;#39;s about it they</text>
  <text start="86.44" dur="4.38">haven&amp;#39;t done really much of anything</text>
  <text start="88.149" dur="5.431">except continually low lower the</text>
  <text start="90.82" dur="7.139">interest rates because when we look at</text>
  <text start="93.58" dur="7.53">manufacturing when we look at industrial</text>
  <text start="97.959" dur="5.19">production when we look at retail when</text>
  <text start="101.11" dur="4.02">we look at housing when we look at GDP</text>
  <text start="103.149" dur="4.021">when we look at unemployment and I know</text>
  <text start="105.13" dur="4.049">some of these numbers are manipulated</text>
  <text start="107.17" dur="5.55">but when we start to look around and we</text>
  <text start="109.179" dur="5.19">see what is going on here we realize the</text>
  <text start="112.72" dur="5.73">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="114.369" dur="5.851">they can&amp;#39;t really manipulate the part of</text>
  <text start="118.45" dur="5.009">the economy that has to do with the</text>
  <text start="120.22" dur="5.64">everyday person and when we look at</text>
  <text start="123.459" dur="7.041">these economic indicators some are equal</text>
  <text start="125.86" dur="10.5">to or worse then they were at 2008-2009</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="8.5">so in reality we have never really come</text>
  <text start="136.36" dur="6.3">out of this Great Recession all they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="139" dur="7.349">been doing is keeping this thing afloat</text>
  <text start="142.66" dur="6.51">by propping the banks the stock market</text>
  <text start="146.349" dur="4.381">up that&amp;#39;s pretty much it because they</text>
  <text start="149.17" dur="4.74">need to keep the interest rates very</text>
  <text start="150.73" dur="5.28">very low because if they let it rise if</text>
  <text start="153.91" dur="6.779">they let the interest rates rise the</text>
  <text start="156.01" dur="6.33">system is going to freeze up and the US</text>
  <text start="160.689" dur="3.301">government the corporate media of the</text>
  <text start="162.34" dur="3.57">central bankers they</text>
  <text start="163.99" dur="5.34">keep coming up with more and more</text>
  <text start="165.91" dur="7.14">excuses of why the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="169.33" dur="6.45">well now normally in retail they say</text>
  <text start="173.05" dur="4.62">well it is the weather we have snow we</text>
  <text start="175.78" dur="4.32">had sleep we had a hurricane we had rain</text>
  <text start="177.67" dur="4.47">we had whatever they need to use to</text>
  <text start="180.1" dur="6.45">explain away why retail is not doing</text>
  <text start="182.14" dur="6.78">well well the latest excuse they have 4y</text>
  <text start="186.55" dur="5.22">retail is not doing what it&amp;#39;s supposed</text>
  <text start="188.92" dur="6.21">to be doing expanding because we know</text>
  <text start="191.77" dur="8.04">it&amp;#39;s contracting they&amp;#39;re saying that you</text>
  <text start="195.13" dur="8.49">as retails and restaurants are not doing</text>
  <text start="199.81" dur="5.94">well because of the election because the</text>
  <text start="203.62" dur="5.96">people are preoccupied with the election</text>
  <text start="205.75" dur="6.63">and they stay glued to their TV to their</text>
  <text start="209.58" dur="6.7">desktops to their laptops and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.38" dur="7.92">just not going out there shopping now</text>
  <text start="216.28" dur="5.55">this is absolutely ridiculous but</text>
  <text start="220.3" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="221.83" dur="5.67">to explain away why all this is</text>
  <text start="224.2" dur="6.63">happening but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="227.5" dur="6.33">economy we continually see that there</text>
  <text start="230.83" dur="6.42">are more and more indicators letting us</text>
  <text start="233.83" dur="6.62">know there is something wrong now in</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="5.76">August commercial and industrial loans</text>
  <text start="240.45" dur="4.78">outstanding at all banks in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="243.01" dur="5.88">fell for the first time month to month</text>
  <text start="245.23" dur="5.19">since October of 2010 which kind of</text>
  <text start="248.89" dur="4.22">marked the end of the collapse of the</text>
  <text start="250.42" dur="6.629">credit during the financial crisis in</text>
  <text start="253.11" dur="7.23">October of 2008 the absolute peak of the</text>
  <text start="257.049" dur="5.701">prior credit bubble there were 1.59</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="6.81">trillion commercial and industrial loans</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="9.18">outstanding as the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="7.09">continued on many of them were cleansed</text>
  <text start="271.93" dur="5.13">from the bank balance sheets via</text>
  <text start="274.24" dur="5.34">charge-offs but then the Fed decided</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="5.25">what the u.s. needed was more debt to</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="5.73">fix the problem of having too much jet</text>
  <text start="282.31" dur="6.99">so they added more debt which we can see</text>
  <text start="285.31" dur="9.75">with everything around us auto loans</text>
  <text start="289.3" dur="8.16">student loans and on and on and on so</text>
  <text start="295.06" dur="7.47">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="9.48">is that in July of 2016 loans had surged</text>
  <text start="302.53" dur="7.259">to 2.06 4 trillion thirty percent above</text>
  <text start="306.94" dur="6.81">their prior bubble peak so we&amp;#39;re above</text>
  <text start="309.789" dur="6.301">the peak of 2008 already now in August</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="4.53">it dropped off a little bit about two</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="4.889">point zero five eight trillion which is</text>
  <text start="318.28" dur="4.38">about point three percent and this is</text>
  <text start="320.979" dur="4.141">according to the Federal Reserve Board</text>
  <text start="322.66" dur="4.289">of Governors that translates into an</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="5.76">annualized decline of three point eight</text>
  <text start="326.949" dur="5.911">percent in September US commercial</text>
  <text start="330.88" dur="6.21">bankruptcies filing sword to thirty</text>
  <text start="332.86" dur="5.63">eight percent from a year ago the 3072</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="5.28">the eleventh month in a row</text>
  <text start="338.49" dur="5.35">year-over-year of increases and this is</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="4.799">according to the American bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="343.84" dur="8.609">institute for the first nine months of</text>
  <text start="347.169" dur="8.31">2016 commercial bankruptcies jumped</text>
  <text start="352.449" dur="9.181">twenty eight percent compared to the</text>
  <text start="355.479" dur="8.101">same period in 2015 so most of these</text>
  <text start="361.63" dur="5.069">that we&amp;#39;re hearing from the corporate</text>
  <text start="363.58" dur="6.929">media well they&amp;#39;re not the bankruptcies</text>
  <text start="366.699" dur="7.171">that we normally hear about because most</text>
  <text start="370.509" dur="6.111">of them are small businesses and what</text>
  <text start="373.87" dur="8.579">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="376.62" dur="11.019">bankruptcies are on the rise the credit</text>
  <text start="382.449" dur="6.451">bubble is above the 2008 crisis and we</text>
  <text start="387.639" dur="3.33">can see where this is all going to end</text>
  <text start="388.9" dur="5.21">up here and this is another indicator</text>
  <text start="390.969" dur="5.971">showing us that things are a lot worse</text>
  <text start="394.11" dur="7.059">then the central banks are letting on</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="6.15">and then we come to GDP now we know the</text>
  <text start="401.169" dur="4.53">Fed is out there the IMF is out there</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="3.9">and they keep telling us how great it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.699" dur="2.94">going to be and they come up with these</text>
  <text start="406.99" dur="3.39">crazy numbers oh we&amp;#39;re going to hit</text>
  <text start="408.639" dur="3.9">three-point-two percent we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="410.38" dur="5.43">hit three percent and they continually</text>
  <text start="412.539" dur="5.671">revised over and over and over and when</text>
  <text start="415.81" dur="6.32">we look at this we can see there is a</text>
  <text start="418.21" dur="6.179">pattern forming now the Atlanta Fed</text>
  <text start="422.13" dur="4.659">already dropped this estimates for the</text>
  <text start="424.389" dur="5.431">third quarter of gdp growth to full</text>
  <text start="426.789" dur="4.191">basis points to 2.1 percent last year&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.82" dur="3.47">fourth quarter growth</text>
  <text start="430.98" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;re high the Atlanta Fed expected a</text>
  <text start="433.29" dur="5.93">robust two-point-six percent growth but</text>
  <text start="436.35" dur="7.02">guess what happened it revised it down</text>
  <text start="439.22" dur="5.65">to around point seven percent then of</text>
  <text start="443.37" dur="3.15">course they revised it up a little bit</text>
  <text start="444.87" dur="4.56">to one-point-four percent to make it</text>
  <text start="446.52" dur="5.27">look a little bit better and we can see</text>
  <text start="449.43" dur="6.42">right now they continually do this</text>
  <text start="451.79" dur="7.05">because when we look in 2016 the first</text>
  <text start="455.85" dur="5.7">quarter there we saw the same pattern</text>
  <text start="458.84" dur="4.33">expectations were very high they said</text>
  <text start="461.55" dur="5.63">we&amp;#39;re going to have about 2.5 percent</text>
  <text start="463.17" dur="9.09">gdp growth and of course what happened</text>
  <text start="467.18" dur="6.76">it ended up at point six percent we saw</text>
  <text start="472.26" dur="4.02">the exact same trend in the second</text>
  <text start="473.94" dur="4.71">quarter of this year where they were</text>
  <text start="476.28" dur="4.23">saying oh this is going to be fantastic</text>
  <text start="478.65" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re going to see growth of three</text>
  <text start="480.51" dur="5.19">percent in just two short months the</text>
  <text start="483.69" dur="5.97">expectations plunge to one point eight</text>
  <text start="485.7" dur="7.38">percent so clearly there is a trend the</text>
  <text start="489.66" dur="5.31">US economy is steadily weakening the</text>
  <text start="493.08" dur="6.72">central bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re trying to cover</text>
  <text start="494.97" dur="6.66">this up they&amp;#39;re trying to you know trick</text>
  <text start="499.8" dur="3.33">everyone to think that this time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="3.09">going to be different and then they do</text>
  <text start="503.13" dur="3.57">their little revision a little revision</text>
  <text start="504.72" dur="3.57">the little revision and hopefully people</text>
  <text start="506.7" dur="4.74">forget about it they only think about</text>
  <text start="508.29" dur="5.54">that first number that they put out</text>
  <text start="511.44" dur="9.93">there but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="9.19">that GDP as it continually declines the</text>
  <text start="521.37" dur="6.09">bottom line right now is that our</text>
  <text start="523.02" dur="7.35">economy is not healthy the way the Fed</text>
  <text start="527.46" dur="7.44">is portraying it the way the politicians</text>
  <text start="530.37" dur="7.11">are portraying it it means the US stocks</text>
  <text start="534.9" dur="5.4">are overvalued and do for a fall it</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="8.28">means the Fed can&amp;#39;t possibly rate raise</text>
  <text start="540.3" dur="9.6">rates anytime soon it means that this</text>
  <text start="545.76" dur="6.81">system is contracting because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="549.9" dur="6.93">seeing everything contract think about</text>
  <text start="552.57" dur="8">it retails been contracting the housing</text>
  <text start="556.83" dur="4.93">market is contracting GDP is contracting</text>
  <text start="560.57" dur="5.21">we</text>
  <text start="561.76" dur="6.53">the credit bubble much larger than 2008</text>
  <text start="565.78" dur="5.45">we see bankruptcies around the rise</text>
  <text start="568.29" dur="5.55">corporate defaults are on the rise</text>
  <text start="571.23" dur="7.05">corporations are laying off people and</text>
  <text start="573.84" dur="6.93">all of this points to one giant</text>
  <text start="578.28" dur="5.68">contraction that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing and</text>
  <text start="580.77" dur="7.57">we know how this all ends in one</text>
  <text start="583.96" dur="7.53">gigantic collapse now we understand that</text>
  <text start="588.34" dur="5.55">Deutsche Bank they are trying to dig</text>
  <text start="591.49" dur="5.46">their way out of this hole that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="593.89" dur="5.85">in but as they continually dig it gets</text>
  <text start="596.95" dur="7.14">deeper and deeper and deeper and we see</text>
  <text start="599.74" dur="7.38">today that Deutsche Bank well they kind</text>
  <text start="604.09" dur="4.61">of cheated on their stress test the</text>
  <text start="607.12" dur="5.04">Financial Times is reporting that</text>
  <text start="608.7" dur="7.57">Germans largest lender was allowed to</text>
  <text start="612.16" dur="6.72">cheat a pardon was given special</text>
  <text start="616.27" dur="5.19">treatment by the ECB in the July stress</text>
  <text start="618.88" dur="5.31">tests as part of the July stress test</text>
  <text start="621.46" dur="5.31">results which promised to restore faith</text>
  <text start="624.19" dur="5.28">in Europe&amp;#39;s banks by assessing all their</text>
  <text start="626.77" dur="6.9">finances in the same way well Deutsche</text>
  <text start="629.47" dur="8.09">Bank they kind of cheated with a special</text>
  <text start="633.67" dur="6.42">concession agreed to by Mario Draghi</text>
  <text start="637.56" dur="4.45">Deutsche Bank&amp;#39;s results included the</text>
  <text start="640.09" dur="5.61">four billion in proceeds from selling</text>
  <text start="642.01" dur="6.96">its stake in Chinese lender you she even</text>
  <text start="645.7" dur="5.46">though the deal had not been done by the</text>
  <text start="648.97" dur="5.04">end of 2015 the official cut off point</text>
  <text start="651.16" dur="6.33">for the transaction was to be at that</text>
  <text start="654.01" dur="7.11">point and we can see right now is that</text>
  <text start="657.49" dur="5.61">it is still not completed and now faces</text>
  <text start="661.12" dur="5.37">a delay after missing regulatory</text>
  <text start="663.1" dur="5.31">deadline last month so none of the other</text>
  <text start="666.49" dur="5.31">50 banks in the stress test had similar</text>
  <text start="668.41" dur="5.55">footnotes even though several also had</text>
  <text start="671.8" dur="5.6">deals agreed but not completed at the</text>
  <text start="673.96" dur="10.26">end of 2015 so Deutsche Bank was allowed</text>
  <text start="677.4" dur="9.55">this pardon this cheat this leeway</text>
  <text start="684.22" dur="4.83">whatever you want to call it they</text>
  <text start="686.95" dur="4.79">manipulated the stress test and all</text>
  <text start="689.05" dur="6.42">these stress tests are ridiculous anyhow</text>
  <text start="691.74" dur="6.72">they were designed to convince the</text>
  <text start="695.47" dur="6.36">world that the banking system is</text>
  <text start="698.46" dur="6.33">absolutely fine and they were using it</text>
  <text start="701.83" dur="5.82">as propaganda to convince the world that</text>
  <text start="704.79" dur="6.34">the central bankers have everything</text>
  <text start="707.65" dur="6.9">under control well they don&amp;#39;t we know</text>
  <text start="711.13" dur="5.4">they don&amp;#39;t we see the IMF is warning</text>
  <text start="714.55" dur="4.59">that the banks in Europe well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="716.53" dur="10.35">too weak to generate sustainable profits</text>
  <text start="719.14" dur="10.26">even if the region saw strong economic</text>
  <text start="726.88" dur="5.55">growth and that hasn&amp;#39;t happened for</text>
  <text start="729.4" dur="6.21">years anyhow now the IMF is out there</text>
  <text start="732.43" dur="6.18">saying that we need to take caution</text>
  <text start="735.61" dur="5.97">because the banks well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="738.61" dur="6.17">profitable and they&amp;#39;re caused by subdued</text>
  <text start="741.58" dur="7.23">growth in the eurozone and ultra-low</text>
  <text start="744.78" dur="5.8">negative interest rates in Europe about</text>
  <text start="748.81" dur="4.11">one-third of the system representing</text>
  <text start="750.58" dur="5.34">about 7.5 trillion euros and assets</text>
  <text start="752.92" dur="8.07">remains weak and unable to generate</text>
  <text start="755.92" dur="8.54">sustainable profits so what this tells</text>
  <text start="760.99" dur="7.71">us is that this entire banking system</text>
  <text start="764.46" dur="7.18">it&amp;#39;s not strong never recovered the</text>
  <text start="768.7" dur="6.15">banks are insolvent they cheated on the</text>
  <text start="771.64" dur="6.15">propaganda stress tests because they</text>
  <text start="774.85" dur="4.77">can&amp;#39;t even use the propaganda the way it</text>
