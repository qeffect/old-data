  <text start="37.92" dur="5.1">first 2016 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="40.8" dur="4.32">episode is the central bank is losing</text>
  <text start="43.02" dur="4.499">control of the manipulated recovery</text>
  <text start="45.12" dur="5.759">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="47.519" dur="6.121">collapse financial news now we know</text>
  <text start="50.879" dur="4.671">today the job numbers came out and the</text>
  <text start="53.64" dur="6.36">US government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="55.55" dur="7.3">telling us that the economy strong and I</text>
  <text start="60" dur="6.06">started diving into the numbers and</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="6.09">looking at everything and what I can</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="4.44">tell is there right the economy is</text>
  <text start="68.94" dur="5.49">getting strong everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="70.5" dur="7.44">been talking about is not true the</text>
  <text start="74.43" dur="7.92">economy it&amp;#39;s not collapsing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="77.94" dur="8.61">actually improving and manufacturing</text>
  <text start="82.35" dur="6.56">retail GDP it looks like the rest of</text>
  <text start="86.55" dur="5.129">this year it&amp;#39;s going to be absolutely</text>
  <text start="88.91" dur="5.86">fantastic so everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="91.679" dur="6.361">talking about to this point was a</text>
  <text start="94.77" dur="5.88">complete lie now actually it&amp;#39;s April</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="5.07">Fool&amp;#39;s everyone I hope I didn&amp;#39;t scare</text>
  <text start="100.65" dur="5.969">everyone but actually when I looked into</text>
  <text start="103.11" dur="8.219">these numbers they were completely a</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="7.68">mess they were manipulated and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="111.329" dur="8.781">going to talk about it now out in a euro</text>
  <text start="114.299" dur="10.081">zone we see that the factory growth is</text>
  <text start="120.11" dur="5.95">very weak in March and we understand</text>
  <text start="124.38" dur="4.71">that consumer sentiment is continually</text>
  <text start="126.06" dur="5.91">dropping the economy in the eurozone is</text>
  <text start="129.09" dur="4.32">flying on one engine and we can see at</text>
  <text start="131.97" dur="3.69">this point and that&amp;#39;s from S&amp;amp;P and we</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="6.99">can see at this point that this whole</text>
  <text start="135.66" dur="7.95">thing in europe and australia in canada</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="6.92">united states UK and around the private</text>
  <text start="143.61" dur="7.05">western central bank world everything is</text>
  <text start="147.32" dur="5.44">falling apart it&amp;#39;s collapsing and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.66" dur="4.049">not improving now the US government</text>
  <text start="152.76" dur="3.03">central bankers came out with their</text>
  <text start="154.709" dur="2.971">unemployment numbers now the</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="3.449">unemployment rate went up to five</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="3.72">percent from four point nine percent and</text>
  <text start="159.239" dur="3.151">most likely what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="2.34">they&amp;#39;re going to show a little rise</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="4.32">because we have to remember we</text>
  <text start="163.74" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing a lot of layoffs and a</text>
  <text start="166.71" dur="3.9">lot of retail stores closed and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.05" dur="4.32">very difficult to continually manipulate</text>
  <text start="170.61" dur="5.55">all these numbers and keep a straight</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="4.59">face so we saw it tick up a little bit</text>
  <text start="176.16" dur="4.47">but I&amp;#39;m sure before the elections it</text>
  <text start="177.96" dur="4.92">most likely will go down fool maybe</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="3.57">around four point eight percent now the</text>
  <text start="182.88" dur="3.72">US government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="184.2" dur="5.49">reporting that they added about 215 jobs</text>
  <text start="186.6" dur="8.19">and we need to keep things in</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="7.31">perspective here and it&amp;#39;s important to</text>
  <text start="194.79" dur="6.78">put the strength of some job numbers</text>
  <text start="197" dur="7.96">into the proper perspective in the</text>
  <text start="201.57" dur="8.19">household survey if you work as little</text>
  <text start="204.96" dur="8.61">as one hour a week even selling stuff on</text>
  <text start="209.76" dur="9.48">eBay or anywhere else you are considered</text>
  <text start="213.57" dur="9.33">employed yeah in the household survey if</text>
  <text start="219.24" dur="9">you work three part-time jobs 12 hours</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="8.54">each you&amp;#39;re a full-time employee in the</text>
  <text start="228.24" dur="10.52">payroll survey three part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="231.44" dur="10.15">count as yeah three jobs and the BLS</text>
  <text start="238.76" dur="5.59">attempts to factor this in but they do</text>
  <text start="241.59" dur="5.57">not weed out duplicate Social Security</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="7.32">numbers so we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="247.16" dur="8.26">there are a lot more jobs out there but</text>
  <text start="251.67" dur="5.96">they&amp;#39;re not real full-time single jobs</text>
  <text start="255.42" dur="5.25">there might be multiple part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="257.63" dur="5.02">but we can see at this point from what</text>
  <text start="260.67" dur="4.98">we just said this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="262.65" dur="5.3">completely manipulated now if you work</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="4.5">one hour you are employed like I said if</text>
  <text start="267.95" dur="5.11">you don&amp;#39;t have a job and you fail to</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="5.64">look for one you are not considered</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="5.97">unemployed you&amp;#39;ve dropped out of the</text>
  <text start="275.79" dur="7.2">labor force now even if you&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="7.14">on monster.com or dice or any other of</text>
  <text start="282.99" dur="8.49">the job websites and you&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="286.17" dur="8.49">looking that doesn&amp;#39;t count you need to</text>
  <text start="291.48" dur="5.8">actually send a resume and your resume</text>
  <text start="294.66" dur="5.2">has to be answered</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="7.17">with an interview that is what is</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="6.059">counted so all these people are sitting</text>
  <text start="304.45" dur="4.26">in their house saying I can&amp;#39;t find a job</text>
  <text start="305.919" dur="4.561">there&amp;#39;s nothing out there and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="308.71" dur="3.63">looking on dice I&amp;#39;m looking on monster</text>
  <text start="310.48" dur="4.89">I&amp;#39;m looking on all these different sites</text>
  <text start="312.34" dur="6.09">i&amp;#39;m going to a headhunter and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.37" dur="4.769">not no one&amp;#39;s calling me up i&amp;#39;m sending</text>
  <text start="318.43" dur="3.45">my resumes to whatever i possibly can</text>
  <text start="320.139" dur="3.03">but i&amp;#39;m not getting an interview now</text>
  <text start="321.88" dur="4.08">have you really stopped looking for a</text>
  <text start="323.169" dur="4.801">job no you are looking but guess what in</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="3.72">their new calculations that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="327.97" dur="5.52">doing since 2008 they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="329.68" dur="7.98">counting anyone now what were the jobs</text>
  <text start="333.49" dur="6.15">that were added in March well when we</text>
  <text start="337.66" dur="5.73">look at this we see nearly two-thirds of</text>
  <text start="339.64" dur="7.62">all jobs and the three top categories of</text>
  <text start="343.39" dur="9.36">old job additions were minimum wage jobs</text>
  <text start="347.26" dur="8.19">education and health and a 51,000 retail</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="5.09">trade 48,000 I have a little problem</text>
  <text start="355.45" dur="6.6">with that number leisure and hospitality</text>
  <text start="357.84" dur="6.94">40,000 and these three top sectors</text>
  <text start="362.05" dur="7.17">accounted for sixty-five percent of all</text>
  <text start="364.78" dur="6.72">job gains the growth of minimum wage</text>
  <text start="369.22" dur="5.73">labor took place while some of the</text>
  <text start="371.5" dur="6.539">highest paying jobs disappeared like</text>
  <text start="374.95" dur="8.49">manufacturing mining transportation</text>
  <text start="378.039" dur="7.431">warehousing so this right now what we</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="4.44">just discussed is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="5.97">but they&amp;#39;re spinning it to make it seem</text>
  <text start="387.88" dur="8.76">like everything is fine now market</text>
  <text start="391.44" dur="11.32">reports US manufacturing also rose 51.5</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="8.22">in one in March 51.5 in March now this</text>
  <text start="402.76" dur="4.86">is kind of odd now we&amp;#39;re seeing a little</text>
  <text start="404.86" dur="5.55">bit of a dead cat bounce we discussed</text>
  <text start="407.62" dur="5.49">this how this works where yes everything</text>
  <text start="410.41" dur="5.43">is drawn down orders will be placed but</text>
  <text start="413.11" dur="6.69">we have to remember this is a little</text>
  <text start="415.84" dur="7.079">blip we&amp;#39;re still contracting because</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="8.78">when you look at this manufacturing had</text>
  <text start="422.919" dur="8.131">the biggest drop in jobs since 2009 and</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="4.209">this tells you something</text>
  <text start="431.05" dur="4.44">that they got rid of all these people</text>
  <text start="432.789" dur="4.35">because there is no manufacturing now of</text>
  <text start="435.49" dur="3.57">course they&amp;#39;re turning it around today</text>
  <text start="437.139" dur="6.21">making it seem like everything is fat</text>
  <text start="439.06" dur="6.21">fabulous and this is how propaganda</text>
  <text start="443.349" dur="3.6">works this is how the illusion works to</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="4.679">make everyone think that everything is</text>
  <text start="446.949" dur="7.801">absolutely fine how many jobs were lost</text>
  <text start="449.949" dur="8.701">in manufacturing 29,000 manufacturing</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="6.69">jobs were lost virtually every laid off</text>
  <text start="458.65" dur="6.12">manufacturing workers they were able to</text>
  <text start="461.44" dur="5.64">find a job as a waiter in March the</text>
  <text start="464.77" dur="4.859">workers in the food and services and</text>
  <text start="467.08" dur="5">drink places now even know the</text>
  <text start="469.629" dur="5.85">restaurant index is continually dropping</text>
  <text start="472.08" dur="5.5">that will start having an effect</text>
  <text start="475.479" dur="4.111">probably a little bit later on in the in</text>
  <text start="477.58" dur="4.619">the summer as we move through the spring</text>
  <text start="479.59" dur="5.669">and summer but we&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="482.199" dur="4.981">pass right now remember every time we</text>
  <text start="485.259" dur="4.5">talk about something it&amp;#39;s what happened</text>
  <text start="487.18" dur="6.03">in the past and it looks like right now</text>
  <text start="489.759" dur="5.821">bartenders and waiters cooks set an</text>
  <text start="493.21" dur="6">all-time new record high of about 11</text>
  <text start="495.58" dur="6.059">million workers an increase of 25,000 so</text>
  <text start="499.21" dur="6.09">we lost 29,000 manufacturing and we</text>
  <text start="501.639" dur="6.361">gained 25,000 jobs in the service</text>
  <text start="505.3" dur="5.339">industry and this is what&amp;#39;s been going</text>
  <text start="508" dur="4.11">on for a very long time now the retail</text>
  <text start="510.639" dur="4.231">sector I said I had a problem with the</text>
  <text start="512.11" dur="5.4">48,000 jobs added because when you go to</text>
  <text start="514.87" dur="5.219">challenger gray &amp;amp; christmas they have a</text>
  <text start="517.51" dur="5.1">different story and as we see more and</text>
  <text start="520.089" dur="4.31">more stores closed you would think more</text>
  <text start="522.61" dur="5.099">and more people are being laid off well</text>
  <text start="524.399" dur="6.071">that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s happening retail</text>
  <text start="527.709" dur="5.94">job cuts were up forty-one percent year</text>
  <text start="530.47" dur="5.58">over a year we&amp;#39;re also seeing big cuts</text>
  <text start="533.649" dur="5.331">in the computer sectors where layoffs</text>
  <text start="536.05" dur="7.289">are up a hundred and forty-eight percent</text>
  <text start="538.98" dur="7.859">since last year the same quarter so</text>
  <text start="543.339" dur="6.12">retail right now is up forty-one percent</text>
  <text start="546.839" dur="6.43">stores are closing people are being laid</text>
  <text start="549.459" dur="6.361">off and of course the retail numbers are</text>
  <text start="553.269" dur="5.76">going up something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="555.82" dur="7.32">once again and we&amp;#39;re continually seeing</text>
  <text start="559.029" dur="5.941">more and more layoffs and this means</text>
  <text start="563.14" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re having a very tough time</text>
  <text start="564.97" dur="4.38">trying to manipulate all these numbers</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="5.419">and they&amp;#39;re losing a little bit of</text>
  <text start="569.35" dur="6.179">control at this point walmart right now</text>
  <text start="571.769" dur="5.711">for the first time ever well at least</text>
  <text start="575.529" dur="5.18">since the company went public 45 years</text>
  <text start="577.48" dur="6.959">ago they said their revenue shrank from</text>
  <text start="580.709" dur="8.771">the year before according to its annual</text>
  <text start="584.439" dur="7.531">financial filing so their revenue has</text>
  <text start="589.48" dur="4.979">gone down and why do you think the rest</text>
  <text start="591.97" dur="5.15">of the stores are closing because sales</text>
  <text start="594.459" dur="6.3">are going down people are not spending</text>
  <text start="597.12" dur="6.759">that means stores are closing people are</text>
  <text start="600.759" dur="6.361">getting laid off even the automobile</text>
  <text start="603.879" dur="6.981">industry despite everyone saying</text>
  <text start="607.12" dur="9.509">everything is awesome the auto sales</text>
  <text start="610.86" dur="7.45">exuberance well it hit the wall and we</text>
  <text start="616.629" dur="4.371">know the automobile manufacturers have</text>
  <text start="618.31" dur="6.779">been giving incredible incentives and</text>
  <text start="621" dur="5.949">auto sales rose only 0.6% they thought</text>
  <text start="625.089" dur="4.62">it was going to rise six percent it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="626.949" dur="5.461">starting to slow already and we can see</text>
  <text start="629.709" dur="6.38">right now JD Powers notes there are</text>
  <text start="632.41" dur="7.409">worrisome trends below the surface and</text>
  <text start="636.089" dur="6.99">this is the first time there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="639.819" dur="8.25">year-over-year decline in sales since</text>
  <text start="643.079" dur="10.3">2010 back in August so we&amp;#39;re moving into</text>
  <text start="648.069" dur="6.841">a problem here and we can see from all</text>
  <text start="653.379" dur="3.291">the real economic indicators from</text>
  <text start="654.91" dur="4.59">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="656.67" dur="4.419">things are still not improving yes they</text>
  <text start="659.5" dur="3.509">can spin it any way they want they can</text>
  <text start="661.089" dur="3.42">manipulate it make people believe that</text>
  <text start="663.009" dur="4.231">everything is fine look at the stock</text>
  <text start="664.509" dur="6.57">market it&amp;#39;s continually going up the</text>

  <text start="688.18" dur="3.659">it seem like it&amp;#39;s going to improve of</text>
  <text start="690.25" dur="3.839">course they are are they going to go</text>

  <text start="706.72" dur="4.71">lower to make this one a lot higher and</text>
  <text start="709.24" dur="6.539">they move stuff all around but in</text>
  <text start="711.43" dur="5.55">reality we can take a look around and we</text>
  <text start="715.779" dur="3.081">can see that everything is really</text>
  <text start="716.98" dur="5.94">falling apart very interestingly</text>
