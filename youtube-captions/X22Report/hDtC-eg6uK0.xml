  <text start="131.41" dur="2.67">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at I mean if you</text>
  <text start="133" dur="2.25">listen to the corporate media it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="134.08" dur="3.15">completely different if you listen to</text>
  <text start="135.25" dur="4.26">the US government it is completely</text>
  <text start="137.23" dur="4.229">different if you listen to the Fed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.51" dur="3.72">completely different but when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="141.459" dur="3.631">looking at all the economic data what</text>
  <text start="143.23" dur="4.17">are we seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing the economy</text>
  <text start="145.09" dur="4.35">completely slowed down the human</text>
  <text start="147.4" dur="5.1">consumer confidence while that data is</text>
  <text start="149.44" dur="4.35">showing us that the trend is slowing</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="2.7">right now it printed at ninety three</text>
  <text start="153.79" dur="4.71">point four this is the lowest since</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="6.27">October of 2016 right before the</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="7.29">elections and the biggest driver of the</text>
  <text start="161.47" dur="7.439">decline was a tumbling expectation index</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="4.979">people are not expecting the economy to</text>
  <text start="168.909" dur="5.731">get any better right now and there are</text>
  <text start="170.769" dur="6.961">certain signs that actually point to</text>
  <text start="174.64" dur="4.019">this as being the real thing and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="2.46">been looking at many different</text>
  <text start="178.659" dur="3.271">indicators we&amp;#39;ve been looking at many</text>
  <text start="180.19" dur="5.159">different signs we&amp;#39;ll be looking at many</text>
  <text start="181.93" dur="4.05">different aspects of the economy and we</text>
  <text start="185.349" dur="2.791">start to put</text>
  <text start="185.98" dur="4.229">these things together and we do see the</text>
  <text start="188.14" dur="6.36">economy starting to implode on itself</text>
  <text start="190.209" dur="6.721">now the last two times Americans were</text>
  <text start="194.5" dur="3.209">saving the amount that they are saving</text>
  <text start="196.93" dur="3.57">today</text>
  <text start="197.709" dur="5.941">which is maybe a little bit more to</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="6.87">maintain their lifestyles the US economy</text>
  <text start="203.65" dur="5.76">was in a recession right now American</text>
  <text start="207.37" dur="4.89">households they scale back their pace of</text>
  <text start="209.41" dur="7.23">savings to the lowest level in nine</text>
  <text start="212.26" dur="6.69">years this is the lowest reading since a</text>
  <text start="216.64" dur="7.23">2.8 percent rate in the final three</text>
  <text start="218.95" dur="8.19">quarters of 2007 just as the US was</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="5.94">entering a recession now that is a sign</text>
  <text start="227.14" dur="5.159">once again now it&amp;#39;s not like we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="229.81" dur="4.53">looking at one indicator we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="232.299" dur="4.741">at many different ones and putting them</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="4.709">all together and when you start to look</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="3.539">at all of them and you start to say okay</text>
  <text start="239.049" dur="3.541">this one is saying we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="240.579" dur="5.101">because it happened last time</text>
  <text start="242.59" dur="4.649">corporate tax receipts they&amp;#39;re declining</text>
  <text start="245.68" dur="4.139">this is what happened in the last</text>
  <text start="247.239" dur="4.11">recession state tax receipts are</text>
  <text start="249.819" dur="5.73">declining this is what happened in last</text>
  <text start="251.349" dur="5.73">recession GDP numbers lower even though</text>
  <text start="255.549" dur="3.47">they&amp;#39;re manipulated they&amp;#39;re lower this</text>
  <text start="257.079" dur="5.731">is what happened in the last recession</text>
  <text start="259.019" dur="5.431">people losing jobs left and right this</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="3.93">is what happened in the last recession</text>
  <text start="264.45" dur="4.089">corporate debt rising this is what</text>
  <text start="266.74" dur="3.899">happened in the last recession when we</text>
  <text start="268.539" dur="4.891">start to look at all this and we keep</text>
  <text start="270.639" dur="6.511">seeing the same patterns over and over</text>
  <text start="273.43" dur="5.73">it tells us something but again the US</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="6">government the Fed those who are in</text>
  <text start="279.16" dur="6.96">power they like to change history they</text>
  <text start="283.15" dur="5.34">like to go back in time and basically</text>
  <text start="286.12" dur="4.68">revise or manipulate the numbers even</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="4.17">more to make it look like everything was</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="5.549">fine at a certain period of time and</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="7.92">they&amp;#39;re doing this today now if we go</text>
  <text start="296.349" dur="6.75">back in time we can see that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="5.43">been playing around with GDP numbers and</text>
  <text start="303.099" dur="5.13">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="306.01" dur="6.15">numbers under Donald Trump&amp;#39;s presidency</text>
  <text start="308.229" dur="6.571">they were all revised lower or right</text>
  <text start="312.16" dur="4.8">before he became president now one</text>
  <text start="314.8" dur="3.66">amusing finding here is that the</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="2.82">following revisions in the third quarter</text>
  <text start="318.46" dur="4.34">of 2014</text>
  <text start="319.78" dur="7.109">is now said to have been 5.2 percent</text>
  <text start="322.8" dur="5.44">while the first quarter of 2015 that GDP</text>
  <text start="326.889" dur="3.361">number which was blamed on you know the</text>
  <text start="328.24" dur="4.17">really bad weather we had a lot of snow</text>
  <text start="330.25" dur="4.95">and things like that they pushed that up</text>
  <text start="332.41" dur="5.64">to 3.2 percent now that was under</text>
  <text start="335.2" dur="5.43">President Obama so they&amp;#39;re going back in</text>
  <text start="338.05" dur="6.48">time and they&amp;#39;re pushing these numbers</text>
  <text start="340.63" dur="8.07">up and making it seem like the economy</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="7.74">was incredible at that time now remember</text>
  <text start="348.7" dur="7.02">back in January of 2015 after we had a</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="5.79">lot of heavy snow cold weather across</text>
  <text start="355.72" dur="4.86">the country and a lot of cities were</text>
  <text start="358.06" dur="4.44">getting hit the first quarter GDP s that</text>
  <text start="360.58" dur="4.98">was a disaster now the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="362.5" dur="4.5">Journal they came out saying yeah GDP is</text>
  <text start="365.56" dur="2.79">not going to be looking good basically</text>
  <text start="367" dur="3.15">this is what they said brace for</text>
  <text start="368.35" dur="4.26">blizzards and other bad weather to hit</text>
  <text start="370.15" dur="4.769">the economy again this winter though</text>
  <text start="372.61" dur="4.95">perhaps not as deeply as last year the</text>
  <text start="374.919" dur="4.56">forecasting firm macro economic advisors</text>
  <text start="377.56" dur="3.54">on Thursday said heavy snowfall pounding</text>
  <text start="379.479" dur="3.961">the Northeast and parts of the Midwest</text>
  <text start="381.1" dur="4.83">will subtract point 4 percentage points</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="5.16">from the gross domestic product growth</text>
  <text start="385.93" dur="4.44">in the first quarter now Forbes came out</text>
  <text start="388.6" dur="3.12">and said you know many economists</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="3.48">investors are pointing to us know we</text>
  <text start="391.72" dur="5.52">went to worry whether this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="393.85" dur="5.58">hitting this weakness and all this came</text>
  <text start="397.24" dur="5.76">out to be true the GDP numbers came out</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="7.41">and the US economy only grew by 0.2</text>
  <text start="403" dur="6.33">percent this is what they released yes</text>
  <text start="406.84" dur="5.699">they go back and they say okay we have</text>
  <text start="409.33" dur="4.95">to adjust for seasonal you know</text>
  <text start="412.539" dur="3.481">anomalies and things like that which are</text>
  <text start="414.28" dur="4.05">you know they&amp;#39;re seasonal adjustments</text>
  <text start="416.02" dur="4.44">and they brought it up a little bit but</text>
  <text start="418.33" dur="5.07">that year they said well we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="420.46" dur="5.07">do a double seasonal adjustment to</text>
  <text start="423.4" dur="3.329">eliminate what just happened here which</text>
  <text start="425.53" dur="3.87">really what they were trying to say is</text>
  <text start="426.729" dur="4.891">they wanted to bring the numbers way way</text>
  <text start="429.4" dur="4.11">up so basically they brought these</text>
  <text start="431.62" dur="3.63">numbers in the first quarter of 2015</text>
  <text start="433.51" dur="3.21">they brought the number all the way up</text>
  <text start="435.25" dur="3.78">to three point two percent so now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.72" dur="5.1">starting to get readings during Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.03" dur="6.15">presidency that the economy was doing a</text>
  <text start="441.82" dur="4.62">lot better than it really was because</text>
  <text start="445.18" dur="3.12">now people going to look back in history</text>
  <text start="446.44" dur="3.479">and all they&amp;#39;re going to see are those</text>
  <text start="448.3" dur="4.53">numbers outlook the first quarter of</text>
  <text start="449.919" dur="3.511">2015 we had a 3.20 this quarter we had a</text>
  <text start="452.83" dur="2.25">four point</text>
  <text start="453.43" dur="4.32">zero percent this quarter we have five</text>
  <text start="455.08" dur="4.11">percent so unless you&amp;#39;re comparing</text>
  <text start="457.75" dur="2.88">everything this is what people are going</text>
  <text start="459.19" dur="3.21">to say and this is when they announce</text>
  <text start="460.63" dur="3.96">these things this is what people are</text>
  <text start="462.4" dur="4.68">going to remember why are they doing</text>
  <text start="464.59" dur="3.96">this right now because they want</text>
  <text start="467.08" dur="3.66">everyone to think and believe and people</text>
  <text start="468.55" dur="3.78">have very short memories unless you</text>
  <text start="470.74" dur="3.51">research it and look it up on the</text>
  <text start="472.33" dur="4.41">internet and go back in time and take</text>
  <text start="474.25" dur="5.73">snapshots they&amp;#39;ll believe that and the</text>
  <text start="476.74" dur="7.47">revising these numbers now at the end of</text>
  <text start="479.98" dur="7.65">2016 to 2017 lower very interesting how</text>
  <text start="484.21" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re setting this up now we mentioned</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="5.16">that the SEC they are that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="490.48" dur="4.59">Securities and Exchange Commission they</text>
  <text start="492.79" dur="4.35">are now cracking down on crypto</text>
  <text start="495.07" dur="4.8">currencies they&amp;#39;re very very nervous</text>
  <text start="497.14" dur="5.73">about crypto currencies they&amp;#39;re afraid</text>
  <text start="499.87" dur="5.79">of them and so right now any ICO</text>
  <text start="502.87" dur="4.83">additional coin offering they have to</text>
  <text start="505.66" dur="4.95">meet the SEC warnings now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="507.7" dur="5.19">interesting about this is that the</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="4.62">government they really can&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="512.89" dur="4.41">about crypto currencies yes they can put</text>
  <text start="515.23" dur="6.48">laws in place but we need to remember</text>
  <text start="517.3" dur="8.76">something very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="521.71" dur="9.3">crypto regulations now it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="526.06" dur="7.76">very difficult to attack the crypto</text>
  <text start="531.01" dur="6.51">currency market why is that because</text>
  <text start="533.82" dur="7.36">according to Alain you who&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="537.52" dur="4.83">blockchain engineer she pointed out that</text>
  <text start="541.18" dur="4.56">icos</text>
  <text start="542.35" dur="6.81">are untraceable international have no</text>
  <text start="545.74" dur="6.72">central authority funds can&amp;#39;t be frozen</text>
  <text start="549.16" dur="5.63">and the SEC I see a warning is the best</text>
  <text start="552.46" dur="5.76">ad for icos</text>
  <text start="554.79" dur="6.55">because think about it if they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="558.22" dur="7.14">around the world in all these different</text>
  <text start="561.34" dur="6.48">data centers and each country you know</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="5.21">has this it&amp;#39;s not the United States</text>
  <text start="567.82" dur="6.69">that&amp;#39;s controlling it it&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="570.57" dur="6.4">free and how are they going to freeze</text>
  <text start="574.51" dur="3.9">your account it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="576.97" dur="3.66">difficult well they say well if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="4.5">on coinbase guess what they&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="580.63" dur="4.89">freeze what&amp;#39;s in there well what happens</text>
  <text start="582.91" dur="6.239">if you have it offline</text>
  <text start="585.52" dur="5.79">they can&amp;#39;t touch it and you can sign up</text>
  <text start="589.149" dur="4.161">to a different exchange you can sign up</text>
  <text start="591.31" dur="4.469">anywhere you want I mean they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="593.31" dur="5.11">freeze what you&amp;#39;re doing yes they can</text>
  <text start="595.779" dur="4.951">freeze your dollar account in the bank</text>
  <text start="598.42" dur="5.91">or PayPal but your cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="600.73" dur="6.35">account very difficult to do and this is</text>
  <text start="604.33" dur="6.03">going to force more and more individuals</text>
  <text start="607.08" dur="5.98">into crypto currencies because when the</text>
  <text start="610.36" dur="5.46">government and the central banks try to</text>
  <text start="613.06" dur="5.19">take control people don&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="615.82" dur="6.18">taking control of their currency they</text>
  <text start="618.25" dur="5.7">don&amp;#39;t want the government or the central</text>
  <text start="622" dur="4.08">bank to have control of locking them</text>
  <text start="623.95" dur="4.199">down they don&amp;#39;t want that and this is</text>
  <text start="626.08" dur="4.699">what we are seeing this is what they</text>
  <text start="628.149" dur="5.461">want to do and they&amp;#39;re so afraid of it</text>
  <text start="630.779" dur="5.981">now a couple of reports ago we talked</text>
  <text start="633.61" dur="5.37">about RV sales now this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="636.76" dur="3.72">John Rubino dollar collapsed calm and</text>
  <text start="638.98" dur="3.6">he&amp;#39;s been looking at the RV sales and we</text>
  <text start="640.48" dur="3.51">looked at it and we see that RV sales</text>
  <text start="642.58" dur="3.24">are booming and you know you scratch</text>
  <text start="643.99" dur="3.18">your head why is this happening</text>
  <text start="645.82" dur="3.66">maybe a lot of people are selling their</text>
  <text start="647.17" dur="3.51">homes buying RVs or maybe people are</text>
  <text start="649.48" dur="2.7">feeling very comfortable because the</text>
  <text start="650.68" dur="3.42">euphoria in the stock market and they</text>
  <text start="652.18" dur="3.42">think the economy is going to be doing</text>
  <text start="654.1" dur="5.07">well so they go out and they buy these</text>
  <text start="655.6" dur="6.9">you know play toys and they buy them</text>
  <text start="659.17" dur="7.289">they keep them and they use them so he</text>
  <text start="662.5" dur="6.93">looked at this and basically what he</text>
  <text start="666.459" dur="7.051">noticed is that every time RV sales go</text>
  <text start="669.43" dur="9.33">up something very strange happens we</text>
  <text start="673.51" dur="7.92">enter a recession now this is kind of</text>
  <text start="678.76" dur="5.699">odd but he explains what happens here</text>
  <text start="681.43" dur="4.92">because people become very comfortable</text>
  <text start="684.459" dur="3.541">people have been seeing the market go up</text>
  <text start="686.35" dur="4.14">for many years those people that are</text>
  <text start="688" dur="6.66">asleep they&amp;#39;re thinking the economy is</text>
  <text start="690.49" dur="6.48">doing well and every time and if we look</text>
  <text start="694.66" dur="4.77">back over time if we look back right</text>
  <text start="696.97" dur="4.95">before 2001 if we look back right before</text>
  <text start="699.43" dur="4.56">2008 if we go back into the 90s into the</text>
  <text start="701.92" dur="6.6">80s we see the same exact pattern</text>
  <text start="703.99" dur="8.219">all of a sudden RV sales go up and all</text>
  <text start="708.52" dur="5.88">of a sudden a couple months later all of</text>
  <text start="712.209" dur="4.441">a sudden everything starts to crash and</text>
  <text start="714.4" dur="4.02">then people try to get rid of the RVs</text>
  <text start="716.65" dur="3.6">and we</text>
  <text start="718.42" dur="5.97">seeing this pattern over and over now</text>
  <text start="720.25" dur="9.84">the RV sales today in 2016 going into</text>
  <text start="724.39" dur="10.1">2017 is about two times as what it was</text>
  <text start="730.09" dur="8.07">back in 2008 which tells us people</text>
  <text start="734.49" dur="7.09">really feel comfortable people think</text>
  <text start="738.16" dur="5.88">that this economy is absolutely fine and</text>
  <text start="741.58" dur="6.66">if you look at this</text>
  <text start="744.04" dur="8.25">you can see from 90 to 2000 each time</text>
  <text start="748.24" dur="6.45">the RV sales well the number of dollars</text>
  <text start="752.29" dur="4.29">that are spent are higher that the last</text>
  <text start="754.69" dur="4.59">time and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="756.58" dur="5.88">now and basically what happens is when</text>
  <text start="759.28" dur="5.85">we enter a recession well all of a</text>
  <text start="762.46" dur="5.28">sudden everything comes crashing down</text>
  <text start="765.13" dur="4.53">when people feel comfortable about the</text>
  <text start="767.74" dur="4.74">economy they go out and they buy houses</text>
  <text start="769.66" dur="4.59">when people feel comfortable they go out</text>
  <text start="772.48" dur="3.69">and buy certain things and this is an</text>
  <text start="774.25" dur="4.11">indicator and thinking that this is</text>
  <text start="776.17" dur="3.87">probably the older generation who wants</text>
  <text start="778.36" dur="3.06">the travelled country where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="780.04" dur="2.58">saying listen I have my pension</text>
  <text start="781.42" dur="3.87">everything looks great I feel very</text>
  <text start="782.62" dur="4.77">comfortable the market my investments in</text>
  <text start="785.29" dur="5.49">the market they&amp;#39;re going up so let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="787.39" dur="4.29">out and buy something else and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="790.78" dur="3.81">seen this before</text>
  <text start="791.68" dur="6.33">this is nothing new and it always ends</text>
  <text start="794.59" dur="5.43">in a complete and utter disaster now we</text>
  <text start="798.01" dur="4.53">can see that the EU they are getting</text>
  <text start="800.02" dur="6.54">prepared for bank runs how do we know</text>
  <text start="802.54" dur="8.07">this well the EU is coming out with a</text>
  <text start="806.56" dur="7.89">proposal that they&amp;#39;re going to freeze</text>
  <text start="810.61" dur="8.04">bank accounts if there is a run on the</text>
  <text start="814.45" dur="7.7">bank any bank in the EU they will freeze</text>
  <text start="818.65" dur="7.32">the accounts so the European Union and</text>
  <text start="822.15" dur="6.42">this is what they state are considering</text>
  <text start="825.97" dur="5.04">measures which would allow them to</text>
  <text start="828.57" dur="4.66">temporarily stop people withdrawing</text>
  <text start="831.01" dur="5.34">money from their accounts to prevent</text>
  <text start="833.23" dur="5.73">bank runs the move is aimed at helping</text>
  <text start="836.35" dur="5.04">rescue lenders that are deemed failing</text>
  <text start="838.96" dur="5.04">or likely to fail but critics say it</text>
  <text start="841.39" dur="4.92">could hit confidence and might even</text>
  <text start="844" dur="5.31">hasten withdrawals at the first rumors</text>
  <text start="846.31" dur="4.17">of a bank being in trouble the proposal</text>
  <text start="849.31" dur="2.61">which has been in work since the</text>
  <text start="850.48" dur="3.539">beginning of this year</text>
  <text start="851.92" dur="7.38">comes less than two months after a run</text>
  <text start="854.019" dur="8.641">on deposits at Banco Popular and we can</text>
  <text start="859.3" dur="6.24">see that they want this in place because</text>
  <text start="862.66" dur="4.44">they understand that this is not the</text>
  <text start="865.54" dur="4.38">only Bank we&amp;#39;ve been looking at many</text>
  <text start="867.1" dur="5.489">other banks especially in Italy in Spain</text>
  <text start="869.92" dur="5.94">in Germany and they know that these</text>
  <text start="872.589" dur="5.581">banks are not strong and they want to</text>
  <text start="875.86" dur="4.5">say okay freeze the accounts freeze the</text>
  <text start="878.17" dur="4.05">accounts they don&amp;#39;t want anyone taking</text>
  <text start="880.36" dur="4.11">money out of the bank now are they going</text>
  <text start="882.22" dur="4.47">to wait until the bank is failing to</text>
  <text start="884.47" dur="4.77">freeze the accounts no they already know</text>
  <text start="886.69" dur="4.29">and once the word gets out that the bank</text>
  <text start="889.24" dur="3.99">is not doing well they are just going to</text>
  <text start="890.98" dur="4.71">temporarily freeze the accounts now what</text>
  <text start="893.23" dur="4.859">is temporarily they can make that</text>
  <text start="895.69" dur="6.389">whatever they want we&amp;#39;re temporarily off</text>
  <text start="898.089" dur="8.521">the gold standard back in 1971 45 years</text>
  <text start="902.079" dur="6.75">is a long temporary period so really</text>
  <text start="906.61" dur="3.87">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they understand</text>
  <text start="908.829" dur="3.931">that the global economy is going to come</text>
  <text start="910.48" dur="4.62">crashing down and they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="912.76" dur="5.579">to save the banks what else do they have</text>
  <text start="915.1" dur="4.53">in place they have the balance so think</text>
  <text start="918.339" dur="4.62">about what they&amp;#39;re doing right now if</text>
  <text start="919.63" dur="6.269">they freeze the accounts and nobody can</text>
  <text start="922.959" dur="5.011">take out any funds they can go in and</text>
  <text start="925.899" dur="3.87">use the bail and documents and believe</text>
  <text start="927.97" dur="5.16">me it&amp;#39;s not going to be just in the EU</text>
  <text start="929.769" dur="6.391">it&amp;#39;s going to be everywhere and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="933.13" dur="4.17">in the United States they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="936.16" dur="3.539">going to freeze it no matter what</text>
  <text start="937.3" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;ll call it a bank holiday but they</text>
  <text start="939.699" dur="4.26">want to make sure in the EU to all the</text>
  <text start="941.89" dur="5.069">different countries as soon as the the</text>
  <text start="943.959" dur="5.49">ECB they say okay we need to stop this</text>
  <text start="946.959" dur="6.091">boom everything is just going to come to</text>
  <text start="949.449" dur="4.861">a freeze across the entire EU and this</text>
  <text start="953.05" dur="3.09">is why they&amp;#39;re doing this right now</text>
  <text start="954.31" dur="3.089">because they understand that things are</text>
  <text start="956.14" dur="3.179">going to come crashing down and this is</text>
  <text start="957.399" dur="5.041">why we&amp;#39;ve been saying get prepared</text>
  <text start="959.319" dur="7.08">because we are seeing a lot of signs and</text>
  <text start="962.44" dur="5.699">a lot of all of this where you can see</text>
  <text start="966.399" dur="5.221">that they are definitely getting</text>
  <text start="968.139" dur="6.18">prepared for something very very major I</text>
  <text start="971.62" dur="5.159">mean you don&amp;#39;t do all of this you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="974.319" dur="3.871">put into place a balun document because</text>
  <text start="976.779" dur="3.99">now you can&amp;#39;t bail out</text>
  <text start="978.19" dur="4.92">you don&amp;#39;t put into a place where let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="980.769" dur="4.67">freeze accounts to make sure that we can</text>
  <text start="983.11" dur="4.74">keep all the funds in the banks</text>
  <text start="985.439" dur="5.14">you don&amp;#39;t do all of this because</text>
  <text start="987.85" dur="6.089">everything is fine you do this because</text>
  <text start="990.579" dur="5.281">you understand that something bad is</text>
  <text start="993.939" dur="4.02">happening because you already know that</text>
  <text start="995.86" dur="3.87">the banks are insolvent you already know</text>
  <text start="997.959" dur="3.451">that the stress tests are completely</text>
  <text start="999.73" dur="3.899">fake phony and false you already know</text>
  <text start="1001.41" dur="3.359">that the GDP numbers in the United</text>
  <text start="1003.629" dur="3.9">States and many other countries are</text>
  <text start="1004.769" dur="5.49">completely manipulated that the economic</text>
  <text start="1007.529" dur="4.831">numbers the employment numbers and many</text>
  <text start="1010.259" dur="5.221">more are completely manipulated they</text>
  <text start="1012.36" dur="5.339">already know that this is a fake global</text>
  <text start="1015.48" dur="5.279">economy they realize that they</text>
  <text start="1017.699" dur="5.341">understand it and they&amp;#39;re hoping that</text>
  <text start="1020.759" dur="5.07">they can keep everyone basically in the</text>
  <text start="1023.04" dur="5.46">dark until they get everything in place</text>
  <text start="1025.829" dur="5.041">and they do this very slowly look what</text>
  <text start="1028.5" dur="5.459">has been done throughout the many years</text>
  <text start="1030.87" dur="6.029">and many people don&amp;#39;t even realize that</text>
  <text start="1033.959" dur="5.25">this has been happening where they you</text>
  <text start="1036.899" dur="5.25">know had the bailouts no more bailouts</text>
  <text start="1039.209" dur="5.911">they went into the balance they did test</text>
