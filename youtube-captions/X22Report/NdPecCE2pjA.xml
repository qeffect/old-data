  <text start="94.13" dur="2.4">were going to bring down the economy in</text>
  <text start="95.659" dur="4.35">2020</text>
  <text start="96.53" dur="6.299">that is completely backfiring on them</text>
  <text start="100.009" dur="5.64">right now we understand that Trump has</text>
  <text start="102.829" dur="7.14">been contradicting the Fed over and over</text>
  <text start="105.649" dur="7.71">and over into the later part of 2018 he</text>
  <text start="109.969" dur="5.58">started in the beginning of 2018 and we</text>
  <text start="113.359" dur="4.531">could see that the Fed they were still</text>
  <text start="115.549" dur="4.32">raising rates during that period of time</text>
  <text start="117.89" dur="2.909">we had the mainstream media out there</text>
  <text start="119.869" dur="4.221">saying that we&amp;#39;re going to have a</text>
  <text start="120.799" dur="4.941">recession in 2020 a lot of the</text>
  <text start="124.09" dur="4.96">politicians that are running for</text>
  <text start="125.74" dur="5.59">president now they&amp;#39;re trying to say that</text>
  <text start="129.05" dur="6.06">the economy isn&amp;#39;t as strong as it really</text>
  <text start="131.33" dur="6.15">is now remember we are in a central bank</text>
  <text start="135.11" dur="4.44">economy this is a gigantic illusion all</text>
  <text start="137.48" dur="5.1">the players know this they all know we</text>
  <text start="139.55" dur="5.7">have too much debt they all have the</text>
  <text start="142.58" dur="5.22">information they just don&amp;#39;t know when</text>
  <text start="145.25" dur="5.34">the economy is gonna stay up or when the</text>
  <text start="147.8" dur="5.34">economy is going to be brought down the</text>
  <text start="150.59" dur="6.6">only individual that knows this is Trump</text>
  <text start="153.14" dur="5.489">why because he has the magic wand now</text>
  <text start="157.19" dur="4.71">Trump</text>
  <text start="158.629" dur="4.681">has been calling out the Fed telling</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="3.929">them that raising the interest rates at</text>
  <text start="163.31" dur="5.519">this time is not a good thing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="165.829" dur="6.27">laying the groundwork letting everyone</text>
  <text start="168.829" dur="6.921">know that if the Fed raises rates the</text>
  <text start="172.099" dur="6.691">economy falls apart and we know from cue</text>
  <text start="175.75" dur="5.709">that they were planning to raise the</text>
  <text start="178.79" dur="5.58">rates in 2019 like we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="181.459" dur="6">before to bring the economy down in 2020</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="6.39">q also told us that there was a plan to</text>
  <text start="187.459" dur="5.191">stop this now I&amp;#39;ve said this in the past</text>
  <text start="190.76" dur="3.899">and I&amp;#39;m gonna continually say it I do</text>
  <text start="192.65" dur="6.03">believe that Trump and Powell they were</text>
  <text start="194.659" dur="6.66">working together I do believe that Trump</text>
  <text start="198.68" dur="5.669">has complete and utter control of the</text>
  <text start="201.319" dur="5.971">central bank system what do we see the</text>
  <text start="204.349" dur="5.73">central bankers doing right now well</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="6.029">they put a hold on raising the interest</text>
  <text start="210.079" dur="6.961">rates why because Trump and his</text>
  <text start="213.319" dur="4.831">administration told them to do this the</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="3.44">other thing we&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="5.369">central bank do is they&amp;#39;re gonna stop</text>
  <text start="220.48" dur="6.49">the unwinding of their balance sheet</text>
  <text start="223.519" dur="5.28">putting all the toxic stuff that they</text>
  <text start="226.97" dur="2.37">have and putting it back into the</text>
  <text start="228.799" dur="3.93">economy</text>
  <text start="229.34" dur="6.959">we&amp;#39;re also most likely going to see the</text>
  <text start="232.729" dur="5.701">Fed bring down their rates and we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="236.299" dur="3.421">talking about that in just a minute but</text>
  <text start="238.43" dur="3.54">we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="239.72" dur="5.009">important Trump is racing against time</text>
  <text start="241.97" dur="5.099">right now he understands that this</text>
  <text start="244.729" dur="5.491">economy is not real he understands it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.069" dur="4.53">an illusion he knows that it looks great</text>
  <text start="250.22" dur="3.269">because of all the manipulation the</text>
  <text start="251.599" dur="4.86">manipulation that he&amp;#39;s been using is the</text>
  <text start="253.489" dur="6.12">same exact calculations that Obama and</text>
  <text start="256.459" dur="6.08">each president before him was using so</text>
  <text start="259.609" dur="6.751">he&amp;#39;s using their weapons against them</text>
  <text start="262.539" dur="6.13">and we look at housing quite a bit to</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="5.399">see how we&amp;#39;re doing now when the Fed was</text>
  <text start="268.669" dur="6.631">raising the rates we saw the housing</text>
  <text start="271.759" dur="5.581">market completely implode on itself it</text>
  <text start="275.3" dur="4.679">was a complete disaster everything was</text>
  <text start="277.34" dur="5.04">completely falling apart and we know</text>
  <text start="279.979" dur="4.111">that the Fed didn&amp;#39;t raise rates in 2019</text>
  <text start="282.38" dur="4.469">they put a hold on it</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="5.129">which is going to help but we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="286.849" dur="3.841">see if it helps enough where the real</text>
  <text start="289.219" dur="2.241">estate market doesn&amp;#39;t completely</text>
  <text start="290.69" dur="3.46">collapse</text>
  <text start="291.46" dur="5.6">already with January pending home sales</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="5.889">they rebounded more than expected by</text>
  <text start="297.06" dur="5.829">4.6% month and month they are expecting</text>
  <text start="300.039" dur="4.861">it to move up about 1% month on month</text>
  <text start="302.889" dur="4.951">now does this mean that the real estate</text>
  <text start="304.9" dur="6.57">market is all better no all this means</text>
  <text start="307.84" dur="5.639">is that they stopped the disaster from</text>
  <text start="311.47" dur="4.35">happening I mean if you look year on</text>
  <text start="313.479" dur="4.081">year you can see that we&amp;#39;ve been 13</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="5.42">months straight in a row</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re pending home sales have declined</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="4.929">this was a small improvement and</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="4.44">remember by stopping the interest rates</text>
  <text start="326.169" dur="4.411">from stopping the Fed from raising the</text>
  <text start="328.24" dur="4.98">interest rates this doesn&amp;#39;t happen in a</text>
  <text start="330.58" dur="6.24">split second now this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="333.22" dur="6.53">the domino effect won&amp;#39;t continue this</text>
  <text start="336.82" dur="5.34">just means he he and his administration</text>
  <text start="339.75" dur="4.389">stopped the disaster</text>
  <text start="342.16" dur="4.17">now I do believe the Fed said that</text>
  <text start="344.139" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re in a holding pattern not to</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="4.5">raise rates again they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.789" dur="5.25">in a holding pattern to see if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.83" dur="5.16">going to reduce the rates because they</text>
  <text start="354.039" dur="4.651">want to see what happens with the</text>
  <text start="355.99" dur="5.19">economy because if they tipped the</text>
  <text start="358.69" dur="4.05">entire economy over the edge well</text>
  <text start="361.18" dur="4.049">there&amp;#39;s nothing going to stop it but I</text>
  <text start="362.74" dur="3.899">think they stopped it just in time and</text>
  <text start="365.229" dur="3.511">if they would have continued with</text>
  <text start="366.639" dur="4.5">raising the rates in 2019 like you said</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="4.95">then we would have a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="371.139" dur="4.981">disaster but they&amp;#39;re gonna watch how the</text>
  <text start="373.69" dur="5.61">housing market does how everything does</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="6.329">and if they need to they will bring</text>
  <text start="379.3" dur="4.679">their rates down now we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="382.449" dur="3.541">he&amp;#39;s been talking to a lot of</text>
  <text start="383.979" dur="4.531">corporations making trade deals with</text>
  <text start="385.99" dur="4.77">China which looks really darn good right</text>
  <text start="388.51" dur="3.779">now and we know that he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="390.76" dur="4.23">bring the businesses to manufacturing</text>
  <text start="392.289" dur="6.571">all back to the United States he has to</text>
  <text start="394.99" dur="6.989">do this to prepare the country for the</text>
  <text start="398.86" dur="7.309">transition but remember we&amp;#39;re still in a</text>
  <text start="401.979" dur="7.921">central bank economy and the economy is</text>
  <text start="406.169" dur="6.911">imploding on itself we see us core</text>
  <text start="409.9" dur="5.79">factory orders fell for the second month</text>
  <text start="413.08" dur="6.3">in a row in December this is the worst</text>
  <text start="415.69" dur="7.56">sequential drop since February 2016 new</text>
  <text start="419.38" dur="5.61">orders x-trans fell by 0.6% in December</text>
  <text start="423.25" dur="4.41">after falling 1.3 percent</text>
  <text start="424.99" dur="5.329">the price in the prior month as Trump</text>
  <text start="427.66" dur="6.68">continually brings back manufacturing as</text>
  <text start="430.319" dur="7.871">Trump continually rewrites the tax laws</text>
  <text start="434.34" dur="7.299">regulations he&amp;#39;s preparing the country</text>
  <text start="438.19" dur="5.849">for a new economic system the old</text>
  <text start="441.639" dur="4.441">economic system that the current</text>
  <text start="444.039" dur="3.841">economic system that were in today which</text>
  <text start="446.08" dur="3.78">I considered the old economic system</text>
  <text start="447.88" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s the central bank economic system</text>
  <text start="449.86" dur="5.85">that will be coming to an end so when</text>
  <text start="453.55" dur="5.07">they start reporting all this data this</text>
  <text start="455.71" dur="5.7">is still the central bank economy and</text>
  <text start="458.62" dur="5.37">Trump he really can&amp;#39;t do anything with</text>
  <text start="461.41" dur="4.41">it there&amp;#39;s just too much debt there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.99" dur="5.22">just too much corporate debt there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="465.82" dur="7.189">just too much household debt and the</text>
  <text start="469.21" dur="7.59">central bank well they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="473.009" dur="6.641">printing and they&amp;#39;re continually loaning</text>
  <text start="476.8" dur="5.58">the government currency and as this</text>
  <text start="479.65" dur="4.23">continues on the situation is going to</text>
  <text start="482.38" dur="5.099">get worse and worse and worse and I do</text>
  <text start="483.88" dur="7.77">believe the the plan for this is to</text>
  <text start="487.479" dur="7.321">drive their system until it cannot work</text>
  <text start="491.65" dur="3.59">anymore and people say why would he do</text>
  <text start="494.8" dur="3.989">that</text>
  <text start="495.24" dur="7.09">because this will show every single</text>
  <text start="498.789" dur="9.211">person that the central bank system does</text>
  <text start="502.33" dur="9">not work it cannot work by pushing debt</text>
  <text start="508" dur="7.469">to countries to people and having</text>
  <text start="511.33" dur="6.35">countries and people pay it back but we</text>
  <text start="515.469" dur="4.471">can see Trump is doing positive things</text>
  <text start="517.68" dur="5.26">we see fiat-chrysler</text>
  <text start="519.94" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;ll be adding more than 6,500 jobs</text>
  <text start="522.94" dur="4.74">in Michigan doubling its hourly</text>
  <text start="525.88" dur="5.76">workforce as part of a four point five</text>
  <text start="527.68" dur="6.99">billion dollar investment so you could</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="5.069">see there are jobs coming back you can</text>
  <text start="534.67" dur="4.62">see things are headed in the right</text>
  <text start="536.709" dur="4.741">direction and you need to remember there</text>
  <text start="539.29" dur="5.01">are those in the central bank in the</text>
  <text start="541.45" dur="5.85">deep state there are working against</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="5.789">Trump from doing all of this but I do</text>
  <text start="547.3" dur="4.67">believe that Trump does have complete</text>
  <text start="550.089" dur="4.921">control over the central bank right now</text>
  <text start="551.97" dur="5.9">because we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="555.01" dur="5.59">Fed they&amp;#39;re going to be ending the</text>
  <text start="557.87" dur="4.95">balance sheet runoff at the end of the</text>
  <text start="560.6" dur="6.45">third quarter they&amp;#39;re going to be making</text>
  <text start="562.82" dur="6.709">their announcement in March so we have</text>
  <text start="567.05" dur="5.06">the Central Bank right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="569.529" dur="7.931">keeping the interest rates steady</text>
  <text start="572.11" dur="9.21">they&amp;#39;re ending their balance sheet</text>
  <text start="577.46" dur="9.72">runoff and they&amp;#39;re doing exactly what</text>
  <text start="581.32" dur="11.44">Trump once the Federal Reserve is now</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="7.13">controlled by we the people what comes</text>
  <text start="592.76" dur="5.85">next</text>
  <text start="594.31" dur="7.45">we&amp;#39;re going to see structure changes in</text>
  <text start="598.61" dur="7.08">the Federal Reserve and I do believe</text>
  <text start="601.76" dur="5.97">that Trump is going to nationalize the</text>
  <text start="605.69" dur="5.31">Federal Reserve it will no longer be a</text>
  <text start="607.73" dur="5.46">private corporation it will be working</text>
  <text start="611" dur="4.95">for the American people</text>
  <text start="613.19" dur="5.19">so what does this really mean this means</text>
  <text start="615.95" dur="4.98">that Trump will take control over the</text>
  <text start="618.38" dur="4.89">Federal Reserve Trump and his</text>
  <text start="620.93" dur="4.95">administration will dictate to the</text>
  <text start="623.27" dur="4.59">Federal Reserve what we want will the</text>
  <text start="625.88" dur="5.64">Federal Reserve loan us the currency I</text>
  <text start="627.86" dur="6.39">don&amp;#39;t think so I think Trump needs to</text>
  <text start="631.52" dur="6.06">keep the Federal Reserve alive long</text>
  <text start="634.25" dur="5.19">enough to make the transition and then</text>
  <text start="637.58" dur="5.34">eventually once the transition is</text>
  <text start="639.44" dur="4.519">complete Trump will then get rid of the</text>
  <text start="642.92" dur="3.45">Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="643.959" dur="5.711">when will the transition be complete</text>
  <text start="646.37" dur="6.15">well once you see gold start to move up</text>
  <text start="649.67" dur="6.18">once you see the currency completely</text>
  <text start="652.52" dur="6.59">fall apart once you see the Federal</text>
  <text start="655.85" dur="5.7">Reserve struggling Trump will then say</text>
  <text start="659.11" dur="5.41">okay we don&amp;#39;t need the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="661.55" dur="6.539">anymore we have it set up where the</text>
  <text start="664.52" dur="8.1">system is backed by gold gold is a</text>
  <text start="668.089" dur="7.411">stable form of money it&amp;#39;s building</text>
  <text start="672.62" dur="8.32">confidence and the central bank debt</text>
  <text start="675.5" dur="9.55">note it&amp;#39;s losing value every single day</text>
  <text start="680.94" dur="6.09">just like with the NAFTA deal he</text>
  <text start="685.05" dur="5.34">couldn&amp;#39;t take it apart all at once</text>
  <text start="687.03" dur="5.73">because it was all tied up in Congress</text>
  <text start="690.39" dur="4.05">and it would be very difficult to get</text>
  <text start="692.76" dur="5.28">rid of NAFTA so he did the second best</text>
  <text start="694.44" dur="5.34">thing he renegotiated NAFTA for the time</text>
  <text start="698.04" dur="5.97">being I think in the end what he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="699.78" dur="7.29">to do is completely get rid of all the</text>
  <text start="704.01" dur="5.07">different types of regulations and other</text>
  <text start="707.07" dur="4.38">things that are in the NAFTA bill that</text>

  <text start="739.26" dur="4.74">I do believe this is going to happen</text>
  <text start="740.54" dur="5.47">right after the 2020 elections because</text>
  <text start="744" dur="4.41">we remember prior to the 2020 elections</text>
  <text start="746.01" dur="5.37">this is the draining of the deep state</text>
  <text start="748.41" dur="6">swamp I believe after the 2020 elections</text>
  <text start="751.38" dur="6.48">this is going to be draining of the</text>
  <text start="754.41" dur="8.79">economic swamp and the corruption that</text>
