  <text start="35.78" dur="5.49">is episode 1003 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="38.809" dur="4.921">June twenty-first 2016 and the title the</text>
  <text start="41.27" dur="5.88">episode is time is short the economy</text>
  <text start="43.73" dur="5.579">accelerates to the downside let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="47.15" dur="5.339">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="49.309" dur="6.541">news now yesterday we had this huge push</text>
  <text start="52.489" dur="6.39">in the market and today the market</text>
  <text start="55.85" dur="7.26">really hasn&amp;#39;t gone anywhere but very</text>
  <text start="58.879" dur="7.441">interestingly gold is being suppressed</text>
  <text start="63.11" dur="8.64">down it&amp;#39;s being pushed down once again</text>
  <text start="66.32" dur="7.32">right on schedule now remember at this</text>
  <text start="71.75" dur="3.9">point they&amp;#39;re trying to push and</text>
  <text start="73.64" dur="4.89">suppress gold as best they possibly can</text>
  <text start="75.65" dur="5.579">but as you can see it hasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="78.53" dur="3.96">moved down to where they would like it</text>
  <text start="81.229" dur="4.411">and that would be around the twelve</text>
  <text start="82.49" dur="5.699">hundred dollar range and every time they</text>
  <text start="85.64" dur="5.22">do this we&amp;#39;re going to see newer high so</text>
  <text start="88.189" dur="5.641">this time around we should see gold go</text>
  <text start="90.86" dur="5.61">over 1300 and most likely maybe stay</text>
  <text start="93.83" dur="4.88">above 1300 at this point and as we</text>
  <text start="96.47" dur="7.34">continually see gold continually move up</text>
  <text start="98.71" dur="8.89">with larger gains this is a signal that</text>
  <text start="103.81" dur="6.49">they are losing control that it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="107.6" dur="5.25">to say okay I haven&amp;#39;t been prepping I</text>
  <text start="110.3" dur="5.22">better prep those have been prepping it</text>
  <text start="112.85" dur="5.28">is time to ramp this up because I see</text>
  <text start="115.52" dur="5.22">what&amp;#39;s happening here and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="118.13" dur="4.94">to see this right now and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.74" dur="5.43">happening in this economy it is</text>
  <text start="123.07" dur="5.469">deteriorating very very quickly it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.17" dur="3.78">accelerating the statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="128.539" dur="2.611">that the government is putting out the</text>
  <text start="129.95" dur="4.5">information that the government is</text>
  <text start="131.15" dur="5.43">putting out no bun is really believing</text>
  <text start="134.45" dur="5.55">or they are questioning it and saying</text>
  <text start="136.58" dur="6.53">something just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now</text>
  <text start="140" dur="6.45">RBS they&amp;#39;re planning to cut 900 jobs</text>
  <text start="143.11" dur="4.51">this is out in Britain and something</text>
  <text start="146.45" dur="3.179">very interesting here in the United</text>
  <text start="147.62" dur="5.61">States is that the New York Fed is</text>
  <text start="149.629" dur="7.53">warning about a subprime mortgage crisis</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="8.32">once again and the New York Fed is</text>
  <text start="157.159" dur="6.341">warning that this is a ticking time bomb</text>
  <text start="161.55" dur="3.51">and they&amp;#39;re saying that well we really</text>
  <text start="163.5" dur="3.95">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about about this</text>
  <text start="165.06" dur="7.05">this time because the government is</text>
  <text start="167.45" dur="6.54">guaranteeing the loans well does that</text>
  <text start="172.11" dur="4.35">really means the taxpayers are</text>
  <text start="173.99" dur="4.69">guaranteeing the loans because we can</text>
  <text start="176.46" dur="3.87">see how they manipulated all this so</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="3.9">this way they can play their games like</text>
  <text start="180.33" dur="5.19">they did last time have everything come</text>
  <text start="182.58" dur="4.68">to a screeching halt in a crash and the</text>
  <text start="185.52" dur="4.08">government is going to do a bailout of</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="6.24">all of this just like they did the last</text>
  <text start="189.6" dur="6.63">time all they&amp;#39;re doing is setting up</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="5.85">different schemes to take care of</text>
  <text start="196.23" dur="5.55">themselves the rest of the people well</text>
  <text start="199.35" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re gonna be out left out in the</text>
  <text start="201.78" dur="7.49">street we see the Baltic Dry Index it is</text>
  <text start="204.84" dur="7.59">down to 580 points down two points and</text>
  <text start="209.27" dur="5.89">regulators in Sweden the largest bank</text>
  <text start="212.43" dur="8.19">they&amp;#39;re saying the bank has a nine point</text>
  <text start="215.16" dur="9.18">seven billion capital shortfall and this</text>
  <text start="220.62" dur="6.51">does not look good now analysts at</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="5.34">Sweden&amp;#39;s FSA had discovered that an</text>
  <text start="227.13" dur="6.56">internal Bank model used to assess risks</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="7.65">of loss on its loans portfolio had under</text>
  <text start="233.69" dur="7.66">stated their risk by as much as half of</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="5.67">the end of last year as a result the</text>
  <text start="241.35" dur="3.66">document said there&amp;#39;s about nine point</text>
  <text start="243" dur="5.04">seven billion in new capital that would</text>
  <text start="245.01" dur="5.91">have to be raised to fulfill these</text>
  <text start="248.04" dur="5.19">requirements now we&amp;#39;re seeing this in</text>
  <text start="250.92" dur="6.06">many different banks where they&amp;#39;re short</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="6.21">where they&amp;#39;re in trouble and what this</text>
  <text start="256.98" dur="7.14">tells us is that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="8.28">falling apart in Japan exports have fell</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="5.48">by 11.3 percent in May exports to the US</text>
  <text start="267.72" dur="4.74">have fallen by 10 points seven percent</text>
  <text start="269.6" dur="6.069">exports to China have plummeted to</text>
  <text start="272.46" dur="5.209">fourteen point nine percent and now the</text>
  <text start="275.669" dur="5.221">IMF is coming out and saying okay</text>
  <text start="277.669" dur="8.441">Japan&amp;#39;s economy we&amp;#39;re only expecting it</text>
  <text start="280.89" dur="8.1">to grow about 0.5% in 2016 2017 maybe</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="5.88">only point three they may be zero</text>
  <text start="288.99" dur="5.73">percent by 2030 now take those numbers</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="3.45">and bring them down even lower because</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="3.36">we know the IM</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="5.52">always predicts hi and these are</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="5.88">actually low numbers and the IMF is</text>
  <text start="300.96" dur="5.37">giving advice to Japan right now saying</text>
  <text start="303.96" dur="5.19">that they need to change things up they</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="7.74">need reforms and the government needs to</text>
  <text start="309.15" dur="8.54">injure introduce a raise base wage</text>
  <text start="314.07" dur="6.63">increase by at least three percent and</text>
  <text start="317.69" dur="7.42">they need to back this up by stronger</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="8.22">tax incentives to help out and as the</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="5.61">last resort penalties now the</text>
  <text start="328.92" dur="4.08">consumption tax hike to ten percent</text>
  <text start="330.72" dur="5.07">which the government delayed until 2019</text>
  <text start="333" dur="7.74">should be replaced by a gradual increase</text>
  <text start="335.79" dur="7.86">in tax of at least fifteen percent so</text>
  <text start="340.74" dur="5.16">the IMF right now has studied Japan&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.65" dur="5.45">economy and they&amp;#39;ve come to this</text>
  <text start="345.9" dur="7.32">incredible conclusion that Ava nomics</text>
  <text start="349.1" dur="7.3">well it&amp;#39;s been a miserable failure their</text>
  <text start="353.22" dur="6.21">advice scrap all the plans for hitting</text>
  <text start="356.4" dur="5.73">any kind of economic targets just force</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="5.239">the companies to raise wages and raise</text>
  <text start="362.13" dur="6.539">everyone&amp;#39;s taxes by fifteen percent</text>
  <text start="364.669" dur="7.031">that&amp;#39;s their answer right now is it</text>
  <text start="368.669" dur="5.281">going to work of course it isn&amp;#39;t because</text>
  <text start="371.7" dur="4.92">we need to go to the root of the problem</text>
  <text start="373.95" dur="6.33">and this is the central banking system</text>
  <text start="376.62" dur="5.58">the way is designed to continually push</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="5.1">out debt and as you continually push out</text>
  <text start="382.2" dur="6.42">debt you can never fix this problem it</text>
  <text start="385.38" dur="6.66">will only get worse this is a band-aid</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="9.44">fix a short-term fix which won&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="392.04" dur="10.29">last now we see out in Europe the EU</text>
  <text start="398.06" dur="7.78">they&amp;#39;re trying to make sure that this</text>
  <text start="402.33" dur="7.44">brexit will not succeed and remember the</text>
  <text start="405.84" dur="6.3">EU is a non-elected body that&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="409.77" dur="6.51">governments to be very democratic to</text>
  <text start="412.14" dur="6.42">have elections when they themselves are</text>
  <text start="416.28" dur="6.02">not elected into their positions very</text>
  <text start="418.56" dur="5.91">interesting in France president Hollande</text>
  <text start="422.3" dur="5.86">he has proposed a ban on all</text>
  <text start="424.47" dur="4.659">demonstrations the excuse that he is</text>
  <text start="428.16" dur="2.469">using</text>
  <text start="429.129" dur="5.97">is that the country is played with</text>
  <text start="430.629" dur="8.85">terrorism and the conditions right now</text>
  <text start="435.099" dur="7.56">are not in place to protect those people</text>
  <text start="439.479" dur="5.64">who want to protest and of course we</text>
  <text start="442.659" dur="7.59">know we have the football termina going</text>
  <text start="445.119" dur="9.69">on right now and demonstrators they</text>
  <text start="450.249" dur="8.19">can&amp;#39;t go out and protest because France</text>
  <text start="454.809" dur="5.61">the president is telling them that we</text>
  <text start="458.439" dur="4.47">can&amp;#39;t protect you and this is why you</text>
  <text start="460.419" dur="4.381">can&amp;#39;t do this which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="462.909" dur="3.99">ridiculous the people are not asking for</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="5.129">their protection the people want a</text>
  <text start="466.899" dur="5.37">freely protest and voice their concerns</text>
  <text start="469.929" dur="4.401">but of course as we know governments</text>
  <text start="472.269" dur="5.52">they don&amp;#39;t want the people to do this</text>
  <text start="474.33" dur="5.619">out in Venezuela things are really</text>
  <text start="477.789" dur="3.99">getting worse right now we know there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="494.439" dur="4.49">seventy two percent of monthly wages are</text>
  <text start="496.449" dur="4.59">being allocated to just food alone</text>

  <text start="653.829" dur="3.781">the opposite is actually happening</text>
  <text start="656.139" dur="3.361">because we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this</text>

  <text start="659.5" dur="4.069">everything the government is saying</text>
  <text start="660.699" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;re seeing the opposite happened and</text>
