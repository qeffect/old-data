  <text start="109.39" dur="5.58">how we were in the beginning of this Phi</text>
  <text start="112" dur="4.819">ad system back in the 70s here we are at</text>
  <text start="114.97" dur="5.399">the end and what is happening is</text>
  <text start="116.819" dur="6.671">everything is starting to shift from the</text>
  <text start="120.369" dur="6.121">West out to the east and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="123.49" dur="6.689">seeing is that China well at this point</text>
  <text start="126.49" dur="6.9">their power their manufacturing power</text>
  <text start="130.179" dur="6.42">well it has reached a point where it is</text>
  <text start="133.39" dur="5.91">very close to the United States right</text>
  <text start="136.599" dur="5.341">now now the United States and China they</text>
  <text start="139.3" dur="4.62">combined 39 percent of the global GDP 53</text>
  <text start="141.94" dur="4.62">percent of estimated economic growth in</text>
  <text start="143.92" dur="5.61">the coming years and 23 percent of the</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="4.89">world&amp;#39;s population but which one is</text>
  <text start="149.53" dur="5.19">perceived as the more dominant economic</text>
  <text start="151.45" dur="7.47">power now according to a recent survey</text>
  <text start="154.72" dur="6.06">by Pew Research Center that varies</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="4.77">widely depending on the people in</text>
  <text start="160.78" dur="5.34">countries survey now however when we</text>
  <text start="163.69" dur="4.71">look at this you can see that these</text>
  <text start="166.12" dur="4.949">results from people in 38 countries</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="4.35">surveyed pew determine that a median of</text>
  <text start="171.069" dur="3.301">42 percent of the people list the United</text>
  <text start="172.75" dur="4.89">States as the world&amp;#39;s leading economic</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="7.11">power while 32 percent named China as</text>
  <text start="177.64" dur="7.32">the top dog which means that China is</text>
  <text start="181.48" dur="6">now closing in on the united states and</text>
  <text start="184.96" dur="5.28">we can see that they have duplicated</text>
  <text start="187.48" dur="5.58">everything out in the West so has Russia</text>
  <text start="190.24" dur="5.16">they are dealing now outside of the</text>
  <text start="193.06" dur="5.7">dollar this is all being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="195.4" dur="6.3">because these countries realize that the</text>
  <text start="198.76" dur="4.83">dollar is at its end game and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="201.7" dur="4.8">getting ready for this great transition</text>
  <text start="203.59" dur="5.16">now what is this transition going to be</text>
  <text start="206.5" dur="4.74">it looks like at this point that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="208.75" dur="5.73">being set up to go out to the east where</text>
  <text start="211.24" dur="6.21">China has the manufacturing base where</text>
  <text start="214.48" dur="5.58">China is part of the SDR system where</text>
  <text start="217.45" dur="4.86">China and Russia have been accumulating</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="4.17">all this gold so when we look at this</text>
  <text start="222.31" dur="3.93">we can see that things are definitely</text>
  <text start="224.23" dur="3.33">happening and they&amp;#39;ve been happening for</text>
  <text start="226.24" dur="3.39">quite a while we&amp;#39;ve been following this</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="6.18">and we can see we&amp;#39;re at this point where</text>
  <text start="229.63" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re at the end of this system and here</text>
  <text start="233.74" dur="3.44">in the United States what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="235.15" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re seeing the entire system</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="6.04">completely break down and what is going</text>
  <text start="240.97" dur="5.28">to happen is as the system deteriorates</text>
  <text start="243.22" dur="4.349">as all these countries stop using the</text>
  <text start="246.25" dur="3.15">dollar which is already happening has</text>
  <text start="247.569" dur="5.491">been happening for quite a while we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="4.29">going to see a slow shift over to the</text>
  <text start="253.06" dur="3.989">east</text>
  <text start="253.69" dur="6.75">now Mueller right now is going crazy</text>
  <text start="257.049" dur="6.18">with grand juries and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="7.41">right now is is he&amp;#39;s using grand juries</text>
  <text start="263.229" dur="8.401">in Washington Alexandria Virginia and he</text>
  <text start="267.85" dur="5.969">is pushing the boundaries of what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="4.17">allowed to do now he was looking at the</text>
  <text start="273.819" dur="3.871">Russian collusion and this whole</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="4.83">narrative is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="277.69" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s actually fake phony and false now</text>
  <text start="280.63" dur="5.64">for the record according to his order of</text>
  <text start="284.02" dur="3.78">appointment Mueller&amp;#39;s independent</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="4.799">investigation was limited to the</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="5.1">following any links and/or coordination</text>
  <text start="291.069" dur="3.451">between the Russian government and</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="3.389">individuals associate with the campaign</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="4.59">of President Donald Trump and any</text>
  <text start="296.289" dur="4.951">matters that arose or may arise directly</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="6.119">from the investigation and the other</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="9.32">matters within the scope of 28 CFR 600</text>
  <text start="305.229" dur="8.821">dot for a now regulation 28 CFR section</text>
  <text start="310.56" dur="6.04">640 a is part of the federal regulation</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="4.53">authorizing special councils it expands</text>
  <text start="316.6" dur="2.58">a special council&amp;#39;s jurisdiction and</text>
  <text start="318.58" dur="3.54">crimes</text>
  <text start="319.18" dur="4.829">such as perjury or obstruction of</text>
  <text start="322.12" dur="4.5">justice that interfere with the original</text>
  <text start="324.009" dur="5.641">name responsibility now he is looking</text>
  <text start="326.62" dur="5.4">into the financial aspect of Trump at</text>
  <text start="329.65" dur="5.13">this point which means he might be</text>
  <text start="332.02" dur="5.7">moving outside of his jurisdiction now</text>
  <text start="334.78" dur="5.639">if this does happen the Department of</text>
  <text start="337.72" dur="4.979">Justice will have the ability to say</text>
  <text start="340.419" dur="5.791">listen since you&amp;#39;re overstepping the</text>
  <text start="342.699" dur="6.301">bounds of your commission we could fire</text>
  <text start="346.21" dur="5.429">you we can replace you we can do</text>
  <text start="349" dur="5.16">whatever we need to do to stop what</text>
  <text start="351.639" dur="5.31">you&amp;#39;re doing and it looks like Mueller</text>
  <text start="354.16" dur="5.009">might be heading in this direction now</text>
  <text start="356.949" dur="4.921">something very interesting happened with</text>
  <text start="359.169" dur="5.28">Loretta Lynch this was former attorney</text>
  <text start="361.87" dur="5.549">general Loretta Lynch now the American</text>
  <text start="364.449" dur="5.19">Center for Law and Justice filed a</text>
  <text start="367.419" dur="5.631">Freedom of Information Act requests for</text>
  <text start="369.639" dur="5.911">information surrounding the 2016 Arizona</text>

  <text start="375.55" dur="4.83">then attorney general Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="377.949" dur="6.061">during the ongoing Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="380.38" dur="6.599">investigation now the ACL GA has a</text>
  <text start="384.01" dur="5.82">summary of the initial review and what</text>
  <text start="386.979" dur="5.581">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now from this 413</text>
  <text start="389.83" dur="3.42">pages they&amp;#39;ve discovered something very</text>
  <text start="392.56" dur="3.329">interesting</text>
  <text start="393.25" dur="4.979">it appears Attorney General former</text>
  <text start="395.889" dur="5.431">attorney general Loretta Lynch used an</text>
  <text start="398.229" dur="5.93">email alias in her communication to</text>
  <text start="401.32" dur="6.26">disguise her identity</text>
  <text start="404.159" dur="6.79">Lynch&amp;#39;s alias appears to be Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="407.58" dur="6.22">Carlisle and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="410.949" dur="4.261">is that Elizabeth is actually the middle</text>
  <text start="413.8" dur="3.78">name of Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="415.21" dur="5.91">now why AG Lynch would be using an alias</text>
  <text start="417.58" dur="5.85">is unknown however Eric Holder also used</text>
  <text start="421.12" dur="5.789">three aliases when he was Attorney</text>
  <text start="423.43" dur="6.93">General the discovery of an alias does</text>
  <text start="426.909" dur="5.73">open the possibility for Freedom of</text>
  <text start="430.36" dur="3.48">Information request into the Department</text>
  <text start="432.639" dur="3.721">of Justice for their email</text>
  <text start="433.84" dur="3.389">correspondence with her alias name</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="3.779">Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="437.229" dur="6.151">Carla and they might discover additional</text>
  <text start="440.139" dur="5.4">communications otherwise unidentified</text>
  <text start="443.38" dur="5.849">before because they weren&amp;#39;t looking at</text>
  <text start="445.539" dur="5.31">that now there is nobody by the name</text>
  <text start="449.229" dur="3.481">Elizabeth Carlisle in the current</text>
  <text start="450.849" dur="2.221">contact address book for the Department</text>
  <text start="452.71" dur="3.36">of Justice</text>
  <text start="453.07" dur="6.42">employees it also appears a twitter</text>

  <text start="459.49" dur="6.66">Elizabeth Karl under the username at Liz</text>
  <text start="463" dur="5.4">Carlile now the cot the account right</text>
  <text start="466.15" dur="6.24">now is not tweeted or anything like that</text>
  <text start="468.4" dur="7.59">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that they might</text>
  <text start="472.39" dur="7.26">find that Loretta Lynch might have been</text>
  <text start="475.99" dur="7.2">using this account to speak to Podesta</text>
  <text start="479.65" dur="5.67">to speak to the Clintons this way nobody</text>
  <text start="483.19" dur="5.31">can figure out it was actually coming</text>
  <text start="485.32" dur="5.31">from Loretta Lynch now this is something</text>
  <text start="488.5" dur="4.38">that need to look into this is what they</text>
  <text start="490.63" dur="5.07">have to follow up on and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="492.88" dur="4.11">see what comes out of this now we see</text>
  <text start="495.7" dur="3.33">the United States they have submitted</text>
  <text start="496.99" dur="3.48">its formal communication indicating it</text>
  <text start="499.03" dur="4.43">will draw from the Paris climate</text>
  <text start="500.47" dur="5.73">agreement as soon as possible and</text>
  <text start="503.46" dur="4.84">according to article 28 of the agreement</text>
  <text start="506.2" dur="6.42">the earliest actual withdrawal date for</text>
  <text start="508.3" dur="5.97">the United States is November of 2020 so</text>
  <text start="512.62" dur="3.63">we can see the process has already been</text>
  <text start="514.27" dur="5.52">starting the United States will not be</text>
  <text start="516.25" dur="4.53">working with the Paris climate Accord</text>
  <text start="519.79" dur="3.3">now</text>
  <text start="520.78" dur="5.64">north Korea has received more sanctions</text>
  <text start="523.09" dur="5.52">right now and they&amp;#39;re trying to isolate</text>
  <text start="526.42" dur="3.72">North Korea right now but North Korea</text>
  <text start="528.61" dur="4.2">has always been isolated they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="530.14" dur="5.79">working around all the stations that</text>
  <text start="532.81" dur="5.19">have put forth to them and it really has</text>
  <text start="535.93" dur="5.22">no effect because as we can see from the</text>
  <text start="538" dur="7.35">past they always find a way to get</text>
  <text start="541.15" dur="8.28">around these sanctions now Russia and</text>
  <text start="545.35" dur="7.98">China they are telling North Korea right</text>
  <text start="549.43" dur="5.97">now to hold back on launching any type</text>
  <text start="553.33" dur="5.04">of missiles because they want to put</text>
  <text start="555.4" dur="5.28">forth their joint initiative where they</text>
  <text start="558.37" dur="4.17">say listen North Korea is not firing</text>
  <text start="560.68" dur="4.8">missiles we need the United States and</text>
  <text start="562.54" dur="4.98">South Korea to follow up by stopping</text>
  <text start="565.48" dur="4.77">these military drills and we need both</text>
  <text start="567.52" dur="5.64">sides to come together now is this going</text>
  <text start="570.25" dur="5.49">to work maybe maybe not we don&amp;#39;t know as</text>
  <text start="573.16" dur="3.75">of yet but we can see that Lavrov is</text>
  <text start="575.74" dur="3.3">trying to bring Tillerson</text>
  <text start="576.91" dur="4.08">into the fold we know that Tillerson has</text>
  <text start="579.04" dur="5.16">made with some remarks so we can see</text>
  <text start="580.99" dur="4.91">that something might be moving down a</text>
  <text start="584.2" dur="5.24">certain path here</text>
  <text start="585.9" dur="5.97">where they try to work this out and we</text>
  <text start="589.44" dur="5.67">can see that Russia and China right now</text>
  <text start="591.87" dur="5.37">they want both sides to have basically a</text>
  <text start="595.11" dur="4.56">double freeze where both sides just</text>
  <text start="597.24" dur="3.99">freeze everything right now and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.67" dur="3.72">start the communications between each</text>
  <text start="601.23" dur="3.45">other now moon jae-in</text>
  <text start="603.39" dur="3.27">even though the corporate media is out</text>

  <text start="606.66" dur="6.12">type of strike plan gay in his green to</text>
  <text start="610.02" dur="5.37">it actually moon jae-in he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="612.78" dur="5.61">work with north korea and he just did</text>
  <text start="615.39" dur="6.9">something very interesting he wants to</text>
  <text start="618.39" dur="5.82">stop the propaganda leaflets where South</text>
  <text start="622.29" dur="5.49">Korea is dropping these leaflets in</text>
  <text start="624.21" dur="6.06">North Korea and basically he wants to</text>
  <text start="627.78" dur="3.96">stop this campaign and he&amp;#39;s expressed</text>
  <text start="630.27" dur="3.48">concerns regarding the propaganda</text>
  <text start="631.74" dur="5.94">leaflets to North Korea as a matter that</text>
  <text start="633.75" dur="5.82">could prompt accidental clashes and we</text>
  <text start="637.68" dur="4.14">know that the United States the deep</text>
  <text start="639.57" dur="4.95">state is behind a lot of this stuff</text>
  <text start="641.82" dur="4.56">where they&amp;#39;re pushing South Korea to do</text>
  <text start="644.52" dur="4.08">all of these different things especially</text>
  <text start="646.38" dur="4.89">in the past when they had a little bit</text>
  <text start="648.6" dur="5.19">more control of that leader but this</text>
  <text start="651.27" dur="5.19">leader moon jae-in is a little different</text>
  <text start="653.79" dur="4.53">right now and it looks like he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="656.46" dur="4.02">to calm the situation down actually</text>
  <text start="658.32" dur="4.83">North Korea and South Korea they were</text>
  <text start="660.48" dur="4.65">working together economically before the</text>
  <text start="663.15" dur="5.1">United States stepped in and started to</text>
  <text start="665.13" dur="4.71">provoke that entire incident well the</text>
  <text start="668.25" dur="5.61">ongoing incident that we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="669.84" dur="5.85">now now out in Yemen we can see the</text>
  <text start="673.86" dur="4.62">battle is still raging and there are</text>
  <text start="675.69" dur="6.03">reports that the US they participated in</text>
  <text start="678.48" dur="5.76">an anti al-qaeda offensive in the</text>
  <text start="681.72" dur="4.83">southern part of Yemen and the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="684.24" dur="4.8">has confirmed that they&amp;#39;ve released a</text>
  <text start="686.55" dur="6.39">small number of u.s. ground troops into</text>
  <text start="689.04" dur="6.45">Yemen now the question is are they</text>
  <text start="692.94" dur="6.03">actually going after al-qaida is this</text>
  <text start="695.49" dur="6.33">part of the cleanup plan or is this part</text>
  <text start="698.97" dur="6.51">of going after the Houthis to remove</text>
  <text start="701.82" dur="6.6">them and as of yet we don&amp;#39;t know what is</text>
  <text start="705.48" dur="5.85">going on in Yemen but we do know for</text>
  <text start="708.42" dur="5.67">sure that Saudi Arabia they have their</text>
  <text start="711.33" dur="6.36">paid mercies inside of Yemen we know</text>
  <text start="714.09" dur="5.79">that Obama worked with Saudi Arabia as a</text>
  <text start="717.69" dur="5.64">proxy force to go into</text>
  <text start="719.88" dur="5.76">to try to make the people go back to the</text>
  <text start="723.33" dur="4.17">puppet government and the people they</text>
  <text start="725.64" dur="4.95">are saying no we don&amp;#39;t want to and what</text>
  <text start="727.5" dur="6.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that all these</text>
  <text start="730.59" dur="7.38">different countries Libya Lebanon Iraq</text>
  <text start="733.94" dur="8.02">Syria Yemen they&amp;#39;re all pulling away</text>
  <text start="737.97" dur="5.93">from the United States they have had it</text>
  <text start="741.96" dur="4.32">they realize what they&amp;#39;ve done and</text>
  <text start="743.9" dur="4.36">there&amp;#39;s no cooperation we know that</text>
  <text start="746.28" dur="4.95">Trump right now has said there&amp;#39;s hands</text>
  <text start="748.26" dur="4.5">off of Libya hands off of Lebanon and we</text>
  <text start="751.23" dur="3.48">know that he sent troops in there before</text>
  <text start="752.76" dur="3.78">in the deep state basically leaked the</text>
  <text start="754.71" dur="4.71">Intel there and that&amp;#39;s why individuals</text>
  <text start="756.54" dur="4.56">got hurt in Yemen so we need to watch</text>
  <text start="759.42" dur="5.07">this very carefully because we have two</text>
  <text start="761.1" dur="5.91">sides trying to reach two different</text>
  <text start="764.49" dur="5.16">goals so we have two factions right now</text>
  <text start="767.01" dur="5.34">one where they&amp;#39;re actually going after</text>
  <text start="769.65" dur="4.77">the Islamic state the other they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="772.35" dur="4.41">ones who support and pay for the Islamic</text>
  <text start="774.42" dur="4.65">state or pay for al-qaeda and we both</text>
  <text start="776.76" dur="4.65">have them butting head now the US</text>
  <text start="779.07" dur="4.32">Congress I hate to say it they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="781.41" dur="3.72">working for the people most of them are</text>
  <text start="783.39" dur="3.45">working for corporations most of them</text>
  <text start="785.13" dur="3.54">are working for foreign entities they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="786.84" dur="4.53">working for the deep state and we can</text>
  <text start="788.67" dur="5.7">see with by Congress submitting those</text>
  <text start="791.37" dur="6.03">sanction papers they and making it into</text>
  <text start="794.37" dur="6.93">law they&amp;#39;re still pushing the agenda now</text>
  <text start="797.4" dur="5.34">the US Congress is drafting a number of</text>
  <text start="801.3" dur="3.75">bills which are likely to force the</text>
  <text start="802.74" dur="4.92">Pentagon to begin the production of</text>
  <text start="805.05" dur="5.46">medium-range missiles which basically</text>
  <text start="807.66" dur="6.48">breaks the 1987 intermediate-range</text>
  <text start="810.51" dur="6.84">nuclear forces now the u.s. is saying</text>
  <text start="814.14" dur="5.73">listen if Russia goes into Libya and</text>
  <text start="817.35" dur="5.04">this is coming from the Congress if they</text>
  <text start="819.87" dur="5.46">go into Libya and they try to work out</text>
  <text start="822.39" dur="5.28">any type of piece where they&amp;#39;d be or</text>
  <text start="825.33" dur="6.29">they&amp;#39;re acting like the peacemaker in</text>
  <text start="827.67" dur="6.75">Libya and they try to remove the unified</text>
  <text start="831.62" dur="5.16">government that the deep state put into</text>
  <text start="834.42" dur="6.09">place there they&amp;#39;re going to basically</text>
  <text start="836.78" dur="5.14">tear up the INF treaty and we can see</text>
  <text start="840.51" dur="4.83">what the deep state is trying to do</text>
  <text start="841.92" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re trying to maintain control of</text>
  <text start="845.34" dur="4.82">the area and of course it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="847.8" dur="5.82">make it look like that Russia actually</text>
  <text start="850.16" dur="4.929">made or violated the INF treaty</text>
  <text start="853.62" dur="3.69">the u.s. is going to turn around and say</text>
  <text start="855.089" dur="3.661">hey listen you violated it we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="857.31" dur="2.91">to rip it up and this is what they</text>
  <text start="858.75" dur="1.77">always do they always try to turn it</text>
  <text start="860.22" dur="2.82">around</text>
  <text start="860.52" dur="4.11">to make it look like it was russia who</text>
  <text start="863.04" dur="2.88">is really doing it but actually the</text>
  <text start="864.63" dur="3.6">United States is going to because if you</text>
  <text start="865.92" dur="4.8">look at this this new bill that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="868.23" dur="4.53">putting into place is going to allow the</text>
  <text start="870.72" dur="5.07">Pentagon to produce medium-range</text>
  <text start="872.76" dur="4.97">missiles which breaks the 1987</text>
  <text start="875.79" dur="4.83">intermediate-range nuclear force treaty</text>
  <text start="877.73" dur="5.31">so we see already they already have</text>
  <text start="880.62" dur="5.28">plans to blame this on Russia now</text>
  <text start="883.04" dur="5.86">Lebanon they&amp;#39;re trying to take back</text>
  <text start="885.9" dur="4.59">their border with Syria right now and we</text>
  <text start="888.9" dur="4.35">can see right now they want to control</text>
  <text start="890.49" dur="4.47">the border in the past Israel the United</text>
  <text start="893.25" dur="3.45">States they&amp;#39;ve been controlling the</text>
  <text start="894.96" dur="3.45">border and it looks like Lebanon is</text>
  <text start="896.7" dur="3.15">trying to control the border between the</text>
  <text start="898.41" dur="4.89">two countries and actually shut it down</text>
  <text start="899.85" dur="6.21">out in Jordan the border with Jordan and</text>
  <text start="903.3" dur="5.61">Syria we see that the Syrian forces they</text>
  <text start="906.06" dur="4.08">have now basically controlled part of</text>
  <text start="908.91" dur="3.39">the border and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="910.14" dur="4.74">maintain other parts of the border and</text>
  <text start="912.3" dur="4.56">control it where Jordan the United</text>
  <text start="914.88" dur="4.079">States the coalition forces can&amp;#39;t bring</text>
  <text start="916.86" dur="4.74">troops through the border so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.959" dur="5.281">trying to close off all the entrances</text>
  <text start="921.6" dur="4.679">into Syria we see already Syria and Iraq</text>
  <text start="924.24" dur="4.349">they&amp;#39;re working together on their border</text>
  <text start="926.279" dur="5.581">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is Russia</text>
  <text start="928.589" dur="6.301">and Syria their strategy is to close off</text>
  <text start="931.86" dur="5.64">all the entrances into Syria they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="934.89" dur="4.35">already closed it off in in the north</text>
  <text start="937.5" dur="4.38">with turkey turkeys now working with</text>
  <text start="939.24" dur="4.44">Russia and we can see that Iraq is now</text>
  <text start="941.88" dur="4.59">working with Syria and it looks like</text>
  <text start="943.68" dur="5.46">Syria has taken control of a lot of the</text>
  <text start="946.47" dur="4.559">border bordering Jordan we see Lebanon</text>
  <text start="949.14" dur="3.48">is doing the same with Syria so we can</text>
  <text start="951.029" dur="4.201">see what is happening right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="952.62" dur="4.92">closing off everything and surrounding</text>
  <text start="955.23" dur="4.26">all the terrorist groups and supplies</text>
  <text start="957.54" dur="4.26">weaponry everything is going to be</text>
  <text start="959.49" dur="5.039">closed off just like every other country</text>
  <text start="961.8" dur="4.44">where they have their borders and they</text>
  <text start="964.529" dur="3.841">secure their borders</text>
  <text start="966.24" dur="4.74">they put patrols on the borders to make</text>
  <text start="968.37" dur="4.86">sure their borders are secure Syria and</text>
  <text start="970.98" dur="4.549">Russia are doing this right now now out</text>
  <text start="973.23" dur="5.34">of the New York Times we can see that</text>
  <text start="975.529" dur="6.221">they have reported that the US has spent</text>
  <text start="978.57" dur="5.43">about 1 billion dollars in 2013 to have</text>
  <text start="981.75" dur="3.9">the CIA trained and armed these moderate</text>
  <text start="984" dur="3.18">rebels now of course they&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="985.65" dur="3.54">talking about these</text>
  <text start="987.18" dur="4.02">small little groups which they call the</text>
  <text start="989.19" dur="4.92">moderate rebels they&amp;#39;re not talking</text>
  <text start="991.2" dur="6.48">about the wider picture where the US has</text>
  <text start="994.11" dur="7.05">been using black pools of money to fund</text>
  <text start="997.68" dur="6.24">the Islamic state the al-qaeda groups</text>
  <text start="1001.16" dur="4.71">the al-sham groups and the rest this is</text>
  <text start="1003.92" dur="3.75">in the hundreds and hundreds and</text>
  <text start="1005.87" dur="4.2">hundreds I won&amp;#39;t even be surprised if</text>
  <text start="1007.67" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s in the trillions right now this is</text>
  <text start="1010.07" dur="3.93">the part that they don&amp;#39;t tell anyone</text>
  <text start="1012.2" dur="4.23">about they&amp;#39;re only telling you about</text>
  <text start="1014" dur="4.98">this small little program but a lot of</text>
  <text start="1016.43" dur="4.83">the money there&amp;#39;s black pool money</text>
  <text start="1018.98" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s not accounted for like all that</text>
  <text start="1021.26" dur="3.81">money that&amp;#39;s going into Afghanistan that</text>
  <text start="1023.24" dur="4.47">completely just disappeared and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1025.07" dur="4.59">paying for ridiculous things that never</text>
  <text start="1027.71" dur="5.34">panned out because that money was being</text>
  <text start="1029.66" dur="7.29">funneled to different locations now it</text>
  <text start="1033.05" dur="6.45">is confirmed that Russia Turkey and Iran</text>
  <text start="1036.95" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re going to be meeting in Tehran</text>
  <text start="1039.5" dur="3.81">this week I think it&amp;#39;s going to be the</text>
  <text start="1040.88" dur="3.84">8th and 9th this is the Astana group</text>
  <text start="1043.31" dur="4.02">where they&amp;#39;re going to be talking about</text>
  <text start="1044.72" dur="5.28">peace Rex Tillerson is going to be</text>
  <text start="1047.33" dur="5.43">involved in this so we can see already</text>
  <text start="1050" dur="5.55">things are actually happening to calm</text>
  <text start="1052.76" dur="5.19">the situation down and to take control</text>
  <text start="1055.55" dur="5.49">to take control away from the deep state</text>
  <text start="1057.95" dur="5.97">we see that the us-led coalition forces</text>
  <text start="1061.04" dur="5.1">they have used phosphorus bombs in Raqqa</text>
  <text start="1063.92" dur="4.26">they bombed a hospital there were no</text>
  <text start="1066.14" dur="4.5">terrorists in the hospital whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1068.18" dur="4.26">and the reports are coming in saying yes</text>
  <text start="1070.64" dur="3.51">it was the coalition forces that</text>
  <text start="1072.44" dur="3.39">actually used the phosphorus bombs now</text>
  <text start="1074.15" dur="4.23">the corporate media is out there trying</text>
  <text start="1075.83" dur="3.93">to blame this on Russia or Syria saying</text>
  <text start="1078.38" dur="3.06">that they&amp;#39;re the ones who use the fonz</text>
  <text start="1079.76" dur="3.63">response but it&amp;#39;s starting to look like</text>
  <text start="1081.44" dur="3.33">no it was really the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="1083.39" dur="4.11">actually it was the deep state the</text>
  <text start="1084.77" dur="5.67">terrorist groups that are pushing in</text>
  <text start="1087.5" dur="4.77">this area and we know that these</text>
  <text start="1090.44" dur="3.03">terrorist groups these moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="1092.27" dur="3.84">whatever they&amp;#39;re all one in the same</text>
  <text start="1093.47" dur="6.03">they have been doing everything out</text>
  <text start="1096.11" dur="5.22">there that has to do with terror when we</text>
  <text start="1099.5" dur="3.54">talk about sarin gas when we talk about</text>
  <text start="1101.33" dur="2.49">chlorine gas when we talk about all</text>
  <text start="1103.04" dur="3.54">these different things</text>
  <text start="1103.82" dur="4.68">this all happened with the terrorist</text>
  <text start="1106.58" dur="4.83">groups and what they do is they turn it</text>
  <text start="1108.5" dur="5.82">around and they make it look like it was</text>
  <text start="1111.41" dur="5.28">coming from Syria but now and over the</text>
  <text start="1114.32" dur="4.92">many many years we&amp;#39;ve been getting all</text>
  <text start="1116.69" dur="4.47">this evidence that no it was the</text>
  <text start="1119.24" dur="2.43">terrorist groups they&amp;#39;re the ones who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1121.16" dur="2.61">been doing</text>
  <text start="1121.67" dur="3.96">and again who supports these terrorist</text>
  <text start="1123.77" dur="3.81">groups the United States the coalition</text>
  <text start="1125.63" dur="5.91">forces and we could see at this point</text>
  <text start="1127.58" dur="6.45">that all of this has been been driven by</text>
  <text start="1131.54" dur="4.71">the deep state and now their world is</text>
  <text start="1134.03" dur="5.52">falling apart and again they only have a</text>
  <text start="1136.25" dur="5.07">couple choices left we see Mueller we</text>
  <text start="1139.55" dur="4.44">see the corporate media they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1141.32" dur="4.38">whatever they possibly can to pump up</text>
  <text start="1143.99" dur="3.09">this Russian story and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1145.7" dur="3.39">trying to downplay everything that has</text>
  <text start="1147.08" dur="4.86">to do with Clinton emails Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="1149.09" dur="6.48">Comey the leakers and we see aj sessions</text>
  <text start="1151.94" dur="5.88">he is out there and he is pushing to get</text>
  <text start="1155.57" dur="4.5">these leakers right now and it looks</text>
  <text start="1157.82" dur="4.62">like that nudge from trump is actually</text>
  <text start="1160.07" dur="3.81">working and maybe this was set up maybe</text>
  <text start="1162.44" dur="3.03">this was to make the announcement to the</text>
  <text start="1163.88" dur="4.11">corporate media that this is what</text>
  <text start="1165.47" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re about to do and we can see you</text>
  <text start="1167.99" dur="3.48">know giving the deep state you know</text>
  <text start="1169.16" dur="6.5">we&amp;#39;re coming after you and we can see</text>
  <text start="1171.47" dur="7.08">right now that these two factions the</text>
  <text start="1175.66" dur="5.56">people working with Trump the deep state</text>
  <text start="1178.55" dur="4.17">well things are coming to a head and</text>
  <text start="1181.22" dur="3.87">what I&amp;#39;m really worried about right now</text>
  <text start="1182.72" dur="4.86">is what the deep state is going to do</text>
  <text start="1185.09" dur="4.11">next because we hear nikki Haley is out</text>
  <text start="1187.58" dur="3.66">there saying yes sanctions on North</text>
  <text start="1189.2" dur="5.28">Korea sanctions aren&amp;#39;t going to do</text>
  <text start="1191.24" dur="6.66">anything Iran has had sanctions Cuba has</text>
  <text start="1194.48" dur="6.21">had sanctions Russia has sanctions Syria</text>
  <text start="1197.9" dur="4.47">has sanctions sanctions don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1200.69" dur="3.72">anything North Korea has been isolated</text>
  <text start="1202.37" dur="4.86">for a very long time they figure it out</text>
  <text start="1204.41" dur="6.12">ways to survive and they will survive</text>
  <text start="1207.23" dur="6.83">this I think what we need to look at is</text>
  <text start="1210.53" dur="5.94">how fast can Russia and China work in</text>
  <text start="1214.06" dur="5.77">calming the situation down in North</text>
  <text start="1216.47" dur="6.3">Korea before the deep state creates some</text>
  <text start="1219.83" dur="6.42">type of an event and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="1222.77" dur="6">Congress is going on break they won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1226.25" dur="6.45">back until after Labor Day and this</text>
