  <text start="288.84" dur="3.72">in the United States what are we saying</text>
  <text start="290.19" dur="3.96">well we understand the central bankers</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re doing everything they possibly</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="5.43">can to make themselves richer to steal</text>
  <text start="297.54" dur="5.85">as much as they possibly can before the</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="9.47">system collapses and while they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="303.39" dur="8.31">this the US government puts out</text>
  <text start="309.05" dur="4.57">illusionary numbers they manipulate the</text>
  <text start="311.7" dur="4.83">statistics to convince everyone that no</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="5.88">no everything is fine the central banks</text>
  <text start="316.53" dur="4.91">are doing everything for you and your</text>
  <text start="319.5" dur="5.58">best interest don&amp;#39;t worry about that and</text>
  <text start="321.44" dur="5.97">we see that what is going on here in the</text>
  <text start="325.08" dur="4.47">United States the real economic</text>
  <text start="327.41" dur="5.41">indicators I&amp;#39;m talking about real</text>

  <text start="332.82" dur="4.98">the devaluation of the dollar I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="3.51">talking about everything the central</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="4.44">bankers are doing to protect themselves</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="4.44">and not the people and when we look</text>
  <text start="342.24" dur="2.73">around the country we see that</text>
  <text start="343.53" dur="3.78">everything is not getting better it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.97" dur="3.81">actually getting worse look at the</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="3.33">number of retail stores that have closed</text>
  <text start="348.78" dur="5.94">look the number of people of being laid</text>
  <text start="350.64" dur="6">off look at the price of food it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="4.199">continually going up even though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="356.64" dur="5.43">telling us we&amp;#39;re in a deflationary</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="5.491">market they&amp;#39;re keeping interest rates at</text>
  <text start="362.07" dur="4.53">zero percent because if they raise them</text>
  <text start="364.41" dur="4.14">the entire system just falls apart real</text>
  <text start="366.6" dur="4.59">estate the mortgage applications they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="5.01">declining sales on homes are declining</text>
  <text start="371.19" dur="5.06">prices are coming down they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="373.56" dur="7.169">implementing all of these draconian</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="8.2">programs to suck anyone in to keep this</text>
  <text start="380.729" dur="6.661">system alive and they&amp;#39;re doing it until</text>
  <text start="384.45" dur="4.969">they can create this event I mean we see</text>
  <text start="387.39" dur="6.089">the initial jobless claims right now</text>
  <text start="389.419" dur="5.591">they have gone up they were expecting</text>
  <text start="393.479" dur="5.391">only about two hundred and ninety-five</text>
  <text start="395.01" dur="5.95">thousand and it seems about 320,000</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="5.21">putting claims</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="5.88">this is the highest since May 2014-2015</text>
  <text start="404.08" dur="6.48">right now is the worst start to the year</text>
  <text start="406.84" dur="7.799">for claim since 2009 the trend the trend</text>
  <text start="410.56" dur="8.78">has changed it is now moving up the</text>
  <text start="414.639" dur="6.96">initial jobless claims are pushing up</text>
  <text start="419.34" dur="4.389">but what they do is they continually</text>
  <text start="421.599" dur="4.44">manipulate and they say oh whoa whoa we</text>
  <text start="423.729" dur="5.31">can&amp;#39;t have this happen we&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="426.039" dur="6.151">to have to remove these people now if</text>
  <text start="429.039" dur="5.671">you remember a couple reports ago maybe</text>
  <text start="432.19" dur="6.69">last month already Timeflies let me tell</text>
  <text start="434.71" dur="6.69">you we talked about all the jobs that</text>
  <text start="438.88" dur="7.92">were being lost by the suppression of</text>
  <text start="441.4" dur="8.01">oil and we noticed that the BLS was not</text>
  <text start="446.8" dur="4.799">counting them at all they said oh yeah</text>
  <text start="449.41" dur="6.09">we lost about 1,900 jobs in that field</text>
  <text start="451.599" dur="5.94">but challenger they reported something</text>
  <text start="455.5" dur="5.159">very different they said there were</text>
  <text start="457.539" dur="6.5">about 21,000 jobs that were lost in the</text>
  <text start="460.659" dur="6">oil and gas extraction space and</text>
  <text start="464.039" dur="7.781">challenger now came out with new data</text>
  <text start="466.659" dur="8.25">for februari letting us know that there</text>
  <text start="471.82" dur="5.31">was about a hundred and three thousand</text>
  <text start="474.909" dur="6.63">people laid off in the first two months</text>
  <text start="477.13" dur="8.67">in the oil and gas extraction space now</text>
  <text start="481.539" dur="6.5">the question is what did the BLS report</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="6.45">are they including these jobs in there</text>
  <text start="488.039" dur="7.321">there are the reports guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="492.25" dur="5.789">not they&amp;#39;re not including it whatsoever</text>
  <text start="495.36" dur="4.42">they&amp;#39;re just overlooking it they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="498.039" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re saying oh no no no this is</text>
  <text start="499.78" dur="4.02">something different it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="501.699" dur="4.56">those people who are continually sending</text>
  <text start="503.8" dur="4.56">out their resume but they haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="506.259" dur="4.981">on an interview for four weeks oh no</text>
  <text start="508.36" dur="4.619">they&amp;#39;ve given up even though six eight</text>
  <text start="511.24" dur="3.539">months later you&amp;#39;re still pushing out</text>
  <text start="512.979" dur="4.86">that resume you might have taken a</text>
  <text start="514.779" dur="5.671">part-time job but you still want a job</text>
  <text start="517.839" dur="5.94">that you in making this may be almost</text>
  <text start="520.45" dur="6.03">the same salary or more but those people</text>
  <text start="523.779" dur="5.371">have given up and we know with the</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="4.469">unemployment they count part-time job as</text>
  <text start="529.15" dur="3.809">a full-time job and if you get laid off</text>
  <text start="530.949" dur="3.661">as a part-time job they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="532.959" dur="4.56">count you unless you were working sir</text>
  <text start="534.61" dur="5.76">number of hours and receiving a certain</text>
  <text start="537.519" dur="5.401">number of dollars so the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="540.37" dur="6.36">rigged to convince us that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="542.92" dur="5.72">recovery and when we look at the graph</text>
  <text start="546.73" dur="4.859">and we look at what&amp;#39;s going on here I</text>
  <text start="548.64" dur="6.509">mean we don&amp;#39;t see them counting these</text>
  <text start="551.589" dur="6.051">jobs whatsoever I mean last month</text>
  <text start="555.149" dur="7.111">challenger said there was about you know</text>
  <text start="557.64" dur="9.22">28,000 or 30,000 jobs they counted 1,900</text>
  <text start="562.26" dur="6.49">so something is not right and what&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="566.86" dur="3.539">right is that they&amp;#39;re manipulating these</text>
  <text start="568.75" dur="4.11">numbers they don&amp;#39;t want people to</text>
  <text start="570.399" dur="4.201">understand that something wrong this is</text>
  <text start="572.86" dur="3.659">why when the president came out there</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="3.69">and said oh if we don&amp;#39;t pass this DHS</text>
  <text start="576.519" dur="3.841">funding bill we&amp;#39;re gonna have a hundred</text>
  <text start="578.29" dur="4.53">thousand people out of work but we</text>
  <text start="580.36" dur="4.83">already have a hundred that 103,000</text>
  <text start="582.82" dur="4.35">people out of work but this doesn&amp;#39;t seem</text>
  <text start="585.19" dur="5.85">to hurt the economy he doesn&amp;#39;t bring</text>
  <text start="587.17" dur="6.539">this up because it&amp;#39;s an illusion it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="5.46">propaganda the economy is already</text>
  <text start="593.709" dur="4.62">collapsing they know it and that hundred</text>
  <text start="596.5" dur="3.18">thousand jobs and DHS was not going to</text>
  <text start="598.329" dur="4.411">do anything because we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="599.68" dur="7.8">sliding downward they just used it to</text>
  <text start="602.74" dur="11.159">threaten you to have Congress pass the</text>
  <text start="607.48" dur="8.82">funding the big game and of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="613.899" dur="6.44">not really involved in it this is a game</text>
  <text start="616.3" dur="7.86">for them we see that us factory orders</text>
  <text start="620.339" dur="5.651">drop for the six month in a row new</text>
  <text start="624.16" dur="4.5">orders troubled by point two percent in</text>
  <text start="625.99" dur="6.539">January missing expectations of a point</text>
  <text start="628.66" dur="5.669">to rise this extends the losing streak</text>
  <text start="632.529" dur="3.99">for factory orders to six months</text>
  <text start="634.329" dur="7.531">something we have not seen since the</text>
  <text start="636.519" dur="8.43">Great Recession in 2008 so what was the</text>
  <text start="641.86" dur="6.75">biggest drop in well the plunge was led</text>
  <text start="644.949" dur="6.211">by consumer goods yeah people are just</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="6.659">not going out there and purchasing they</text>
  <text start="651.16" dur="9.66">don&amp;#39;t have the money they&amp;#39;re tapped out</text>
  <text start="655.269" dur="6.961">but don&amp;#39;t worry as we go forward the</text>
  <text start="660.82" dur="3.84">government is going to come out with new</text>
  <text start="662.23" dur="4.71">taxes because they believe that people</text>
  <text start="664.66" dur="3.42">still have money they believe that</text>
  <text start="666.94" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re going to find the</text>
  <text start="668.08" dur="6.09">money someplace but it&amp;#39;s nowhere to be</text>
  <text start="670.18" dur="5.88">found we don&amp;#39;t have any more people are</text>
  <text start="674.17" dur="5.76">losing jobs left and right here I mean</text>

  <text start="679.93" dur="4.22">people I mean if you look at the numbers</text>
  <text start="682.69" dur="5.16">since the beginning of the year now</text>
  <text start="684.15" dur="6.79">we&amp;#39;re close to probably over a hundred</text>
  <text start="687.85" dur="6.54">and seventy thousand people already who</text>
  <text start="690.94" dur="8.52">lost their jobs where are these people</text>
  <text start="694.39" dur="6.24">going to find work but during all this</text>

  <text start="710.41" dur="6.48">Europe they&amp;#39;re having trouble food is</text>
  <text start="712.98" dur="7.63">rotting and we see that Italy and Russia</text>
  <text start="716.89" dur="8.01">have been in meetings and they want to</text>
  <text start="720.61" dur="6.96">grow their economies together but again</text>
  <text start="724.9" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s very difficult because the european</text>

  <text start="755.23" dur="3.51">looking for ways of spurring economic</text>
  <text start="756.97" dur="4.23">growth and I think it&amp;#39;s going to spread</text>
  <text start="758.74" dur="4.23">once Greece goes ahead and does</text>
  <text start="761.2" dur="4.08">something that people really don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="775.33" dur="3.69">people are going to get upset and</text>
  <text start="776.5" dur="5.04">throughout the government so we better</text>
  <text start="779.02" dur="5.16">do something at this point we better</text>
  <text start="781.54" dur="5.91">exit and look for other alternatives and</text>
  <text start="784.18" dur="6.33">once this happens this will spread and</text>
  <text start="787.45" dur="5.07">the eurozone knows this and Russia knows</text>
  <text start="790.51" dur="4.41">this and this is why they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="792.52" dur="4.65">contact with all of these nations at</text>

  <text start="820.18" dur="4.41">protest but guess what it didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="822.78" dur="3.28">actually the opposite is happening</text>
  <text start="824.59" dur="4.86">Russia is actually doing a little bit</text>
  <text start="826.06" dur="4.86">better now after the sanctions them</text>
  <text start="829.45" dur="5.22">before the sanctions since they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1132.669" dur="6.09">is about to happen will it stop it</text>
  <text start="1135.549" dur="6.541">absolutely not but it will make it look</text>

  <text start="1151.21" dur="7.26">is why we need to go to war now we</text>
  <text start="1155.379" dur="6.12">talked about Hillary Clinton and her</text>
  <text start="1158.47" dur="5.61">email problem here and we come to find</text>
  <text start="1161.499" dur="6.9">out she&amp;#39;s not using hotmail she&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1164.08" dur="9.51">using yahoo she&amp;#39;s using her own personal</text>
  <text start="1168.399" dur="8.37">mail domain she has a server setup in</text>
  <text start="1173.59" dur="5.189">her home in Chappaqua and let me just</text>
  <text start="1176.769" dur="4.441">say it&amp;#39;s not something you just flip a</text>
  <text start="1178.779" dur="5.28">switch and you decide to do it you have</text>
  <text start="1181.21" dur="5.37">to go out and buy the domain name which</text>
  <text start="1184.059" dur="4.95">then will be registered you have to set</text>
  <text start="1186.58" dur="5.52">up the server you have to set up the</text>
  <text start="1189.009" dur="7.38">security you&amp;#39;d have to set up the email</text>
  <text start="1192.1" dur="5.669">exchange system create the mailboxes so</text>
  <text start="1196.389" dur="4.201">this is not something that happened</text>
  <text start="1197.769" dur="6.14">overnight and we can see right now it</text>
  <text start="1200.59" dur="8.37">was done on purpose that she set up a</text>
  <text start="1203.909" dur="7.63">personal email system and again this was</text>
  <text start="1208.96" dur="6.24">set up by most likely another company</text>
  <text start="1211.539" dur="7.231">and no one knows who it is but you have</text>
  <text start="1215.2" dur="5.01">to be you know tech savvy to do</text>
  <text start="1218.77" dur="2.82">something like this it&amp;#39;s not something</text>
  <text start="1220.21" dur="3.839">you just click one button and everything</text>
  <text start="1221.59" dur="5.699">was ready to go but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1224.049" dur="5.401">interesting about this is that i looked</text>
  <text start="1227.289" dur="5.721">up the who is date of when she created</text>
  <text start="1229.45" dur="8.06">her domain name for her email and it was</text>
  <text start="1233.01" dur="7.81">January of 2009 when she was starting as</text>
  <text start="1237.51" dur="6.279">Secretary of State it&amp;#39;s not like she had</text>
  <text start="1240.82" dur="7.709">this beforehand this was put into place</text>
  <text start="1243.789" dur="7.711">on purpose to keep all emails out of the</text>
  <text start="1248.529" dur="6.841">government and private now the question</text>
  <text start="1251.5" dur="7.44">is why would they do this what would be</text>
  <text start="1255.37" dur="6.33">the reason for doing this well for one</text>
  <text start="1258.94" dur="4.95">reason is that operating her own server</text>
  <text start="1261.7" dur="5.04">would have afforded Clinton additional</text>
  <text start="1263.89" dur="4.62">legal opportunities to block government</text>
  <text start="1266.74" dur="4.53">or private subpoenas in criminal</text>
  <text start="1268.51" dur="5.25">administrative or civil cases because</text>
  <text start="1271.27" dur="5.42">her lawyers could object in court before</text>
  <text start="1273.76" dur="5.94">being forced to turn over any emails I</text>
  <text start="1276.69" dur="6.16">mean Judge Napolitano is out there and</text>
  <text start="1279.7" dur="4.8">he is saying that Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="1282.85" dur="4.17">Hillary Clinton is potentially facing</text>
  <text start="1284.5" dur="3.929">prison time for hiding documents from</text>
  <text start="1287.02" dur="3.06">government computers now do I think</text>
  <text start="1288.429" dur="6.36">that&amp;#39;s going to happen most likely not</text>
  <text start="1290.08" dur="9.87">and again we don&amp;#39;t even know which</text>
  <text start="1294.789" dur="8.431">documents are classified and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="1299.95" dur="7.38">that for each document is like a three</text>
  <text start="1303.22" dur="7.829">years in jail so this is turning out to</text>
  <text start="1307.33" dur="5.849">be a bigger and bigger scandal and we</text>
  <text start="1311.049" dur="4.771">can see I wonder if a lot of other</text>
  <text start="1313.179" dur="5.1">government officials do the same thing</text>
  <text start="1315.82" dur="5.43">where they set up their own private</text>
  <text start="1318.279" dur="5.311">email I believe George Bush did this and</text>
  <text start="1321.25" dur="4.95">Hillary Clinton was out there saying</text>
  <text start="1323.59" dur="5.16">that this shouldn&amp;#39;t be done and now we</text>
  <text start="1326.2" dur="4.17">see her doing it and I think a lot of a</text>
  <text start="1328.75" dur="3.6">lot of government officials were going</text>
  <text start="1330.37" dur="3.799">to come to find out that yeah they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1332.35" dur="4.429">bypassing this because they&amp;#39;re high</text>
  <text start="1334.169" dur="4.14">all the things that they&amp;#39;re doing now</text>
  <text start="1336.779" dur="3.24">for those people who have been listening</text>
  <text start="1338.309" dur="3.72">to me for quite a while you understand</text>
  <text start="1340.019" dur="3.9">how I feel about Obamacare i do not</text>
  <text start="1342.029" dur="3.99">think this is for the people i believe</text>
  <text start="1343.919" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s for taxes which we can see because</text>
  <text start="1346.019" dur="3.811">they put on penalties it&amp;#39;s to make the</text>
  <text start="1347.999" dur="4.89">insurance companies very wealthy and</text>
  <text start="1349.83" dur="5.069">this has nothing to do with insurance</text>

  <text start="1354.899" dur="5.941">and we can see when Obama first came out</text>
  <text start="1358.889" dur="3.51">he told us that this is going to be</text>
  <text start="1360.84" dur="3.719">universal coverage everyone will be</text>
  <text start="1362.399" dur="5.37">covered a hundred percent but we find</text>
  <text start="1364.559" dur="5.641">out that no Obamacare increased the</text>
  <text start="1367.769" dur="5.931">insurance from 85 only to eighty-seven</text>
  <text start="1370.2" dur="5.729">percent insurance rates have increased</text>
  <text start="1373.7" dur="4.599">even though it&amp;#39;s called the Affordable</text>
  <text start="1375.929" dur="3.901">Care Act so he didn&amp;#39;t meet the one</text>
  <text start="1378.299" dur="5.641">hundred percent goal but let me just say</text>
  <text start="1379.83" dur="8.689">this could have been done and up to two</text>
  <text start="1383.94" dur="8.969">percent or so without Obamacare because</text>
  <text start="1388.519" dur="7.12">basically all he did was put a penalty</text>
  <text start="1392.909" dur="7.02">on there saying if you do not take the</text>
  <text start="1395.639" dur="7.051">insurance you will be taxed we are going</text>
  <text start="1399.929" dur="5.551">to drop all your insurance policy so you</text>
  <text start="1402.69" dur="8.88">have to go on Obamacare so what really</text>
  <text start="1405.48" dur="8.549">happened here not much I mean Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1411.57" dur="6.809">started being available october twenty</text>
  <text start="1414.029" dur="7.26">third on october2013 and has now been</text>
  <text start="1418.379" dur="4.62">available for 16 months when candidate</text>
  <text start="1421.289" dur="5.07">Obama was running for the presidency he</text>
  <text start="1422.999" dur="6.601">promised universal coverage but guess</text>
  <text start="1426.359" dur="6.601">this exists in other countries they have</text>
  <text start="1429.6" dur="5.189">it 100% everyone insured notice it no</text>
  <text start="1432.96" dur="5.909">citizen lacking health insurance for</text>

  <text start="1440.97" dur="10.319">months and every single American is not</text>
  <text start="1445.409" dur="9.24">insured so what did this really do it</text>
  <text start="1451.289" dur="4.801">did nothing it&amp;#39;s the same amount of</text>
  <text start="1454.649" dur="4.98">people that&amp;#39;s ensure that it was before</text>
  <text start="1456.09" dur="5.939">except now all those people about what</text>

  <text start="1462.029" dur="6.24">insurance they&amp;#39;re going to get taxed now</text>
  <text start="1464.73" dur="6.329">and those people who are on insurance</text>
  <text start="1468.269" dur="8.25">they&amp;#39;re paying higher premiums with less</text>
  <text start="1471.059" dur="8.401">coverage is this actually better no it</text>
  <text start="1476.519" dur="6.24">is not this is not what the people</text>
  <text start="1479.46" dur="6.689">wanted this doesn&amp;#39;t benefit the people</text>
  <text start="1482.759" dur="7.38">it benefits who the US government the</text>
  <text start="1486.149" dur="6.78">central bankers once again and the</text>
  <text start="1490.139" dur="6.54">insurance companies now we talked about</text>
  <text start="1492.929" dur="5.63">the black site in Chicago where they</text>

  <text start="1498.559" dur="5.05">violating pretty much every right they</text>
  <text start="1500.999" dur="5.88">have and of course this comes under the</text>
  <text start="1503.609" dur="5.221">jurisdiction of the NDAA and we see that</text>
  <text start="1506.879" dur="4.191">this is one of the methods of one of the</text>
  <text start="1508.83" dur="4.529">steps I should say of closing down a</text>

  <text start="1513.359" dur="2.94">mean you can go back to my other reports</text>
  <text start="1514.83" dur="3.9">and listen to what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="1516.299" dur="3.99">this is about naomi wolf who looked</text>
  <text start="1518.73" dur="3.84">around at all different countries and</text>
  <text start="1520.289" dur="4.77">put together ten steps on closing down</text>
  <text start="1522.57" dur="4.62">to society and we are almost there but</text>
  <text start="1525.059" dur="4.62">it looks like they&amp;#39;re having a protest</text>
  <text start="1527.19" dur="5.609">out in chicago at home on square and</text>
  <text start="1529.679" dur="5.88">there&amp;#39;s as many as 1,500 people right</text>
  <text start="1532.799" dur="6.12">now and even more might be showing up on</text>
  <text start="1535.559" dur="8.87">saturday to protest about what is going</text>
  <text start="1538.919" dur="8.521">on now we understand the FCC they have</text>
  <text start="1544.429" dur="6.25">voted to take over the internet they</text>
  <text start="1547.44" dur="5.849">created 332 pages of regulation which</text>
  <text start="1550.679" dur="4.021">nobody can see because it&amp;#39;s a secret and</text>
  <text start="1553.289" dur="3.06">that means there&amp;#39;s something in there</text>
  <text start="1554.7" dur="5.52">that they don&amp;#39;t want people to see just</text>
  <text start="1556.349" dur="7.41">yet but tech freedom held a chat with to</text>
  <text start="1560.22" dur="6.449">FCC commissioners Ajit Pai and Mike</text>
  <text start="1563.759" dur="4.11">O&amp;#39;Reilly and the two of them concurred</text>
  <text start="1566.669" dur="4.291">that the new regulations are</text>
  <text start="1567.869" dur="6.3">far-reaching largely unchecked and pose</text>
  <text start="1570.96" dur="6.719">a threat to consumer bills and to the</text>
  <text start="1574.169" dur="7.531">innovation in the industry and they are</text>
  <text start="1577.679" dur="10.021">saying that there&amp;#39;s a problem with the</text>
  <text start="1581.7" dur="7.62">internet but the FCC the two FCC</text>
  <text start="1587.7" dur="5.219">commissioners are saying there&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="1589.32" dur="6.42">been a systematic analysis of what the</text>
  <text start="1592.919" dur="5.371">problem with the internet is and how</text>
  <text start="1595.74" dur="5.79">long is the Internet bin function</text>
  <text start="1598.29" dur="5.67">quite a while they&amp;#39;ve never ever said</text>
  <text start="1601.53" dur="6.24">this is why we&amp;#39;re doing this because we</text>
  <text start="1603.96" dur="6.87">have this problem there is no problem</text>
  <text start="1607.77" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s just it they haven&amp;#39;t even done an</text>
  <text start="1610.83" dur="4.74">analysis but they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="1612.45" dur="7.83">us that there is a problem they made</text>
  <text start="1615.57" dur="6.48">this out of thin air the FCC was going</text>
  <text start="1620.28" dur="4.17">to centralize powers over what</text>
  <text start="1622.05" dur="4.29">infrastructure was deployed and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1624.45" dur="4.41">through the use of statutes and other</text>
  <text start="1626.34" dur="4.92">laws the FCC was going to use section</text>
  <text start="1628.86" dur="5.19">201 of the Communications Act to do its</text>
  <text start="1631.26" dur="5.07">dirty work the consumer will inherit</text>
  <text start="1634.05" dur="4.26">many of these new costs and burdens and</text>
  <text start="1636.33" dur="4.92">again this is one of the agendas for</text>
  <text start="1638.31" dur="5.4">this is to put new taxes on the Internet</text>
  <text start="1641.25" dur="5.73">the other one is to control it the other</text>
  <text start="1643.71" dur="4.92">one is for censorship this is what is</text>
  <text start="1646.98" dur="3.99">going on we&amp;#39;re going to see rates go up</text>
  <text start="1648.63" dur="7.17">because the taxes are going to be put on</text>
  <text start="1650.97" dur="8.1">to everyone&amp;#39;s internet connection the</text>
  <text start="1655.8" dur="5.97">SEC regulations will give a lot more</text>
  <text start="1659.07" dur="5.7">power to the government the net may be</text>
  <text start="1661.77" dur="7.68">neutral but the FCC is most certainly</text>
  <text start="1664.77" dur="9.33">not and we know for a fact this is all</text>
  <text start="1669.45" dur="7.02">being down to shut down the flow of</text>
  <text start="1674.1" dur="5.64">information they already control the</text>
  <text start="1676.47" dur="6">corporate media they feed them</text>
  <text start="1679.74" dur="4.08">propaganda and the corporate media just</text>
  <text start="1682.47" dur="5.24">regurgitates whatever the government</text>
  <text start="1683.82" dur="8.67">gives them there is no investigation</text>
  <text start="1687.71" dur="9.42">investigative reporting any more or just</text>
  <text start="1692.49" dur="8.01">a hair a little bit to non-existent and</text>
  <text start="1697.13" dur="5.68">over the corporate media the government</text>
  <text start="1700.5" dur="5.13">has full control the problem is is the</text>
  <text start="1702.81" dur="5.4">internet they don&amp;#39;t have control of the</text>
  <text start="1705.63" dur="4.53">alternative media new mini this is why</text>
  <text start="1708.21" dur="3.93">Feinstein is that they&amp;#39;re trying to tell</text>
  <text start="1710.16" dur="3.9">everyone that we the government will</text>
  <text start="1712.14" dur="3.89">decide who is a journalist and who isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1714.06" dur="5.85">a journalist we will give them licenses</text>
  <text start="1716.03" dur="6.46">we will decide who will be able to</text>

  <text start="1722.49" dur="4.44">to get a license you&amp;#39;ll have to pay a</text>
  <text start="1724.68" dur="4.62">huge fine and if you say anything we</text>
  <text start="1726.93" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t agree with guess what we will shut</text>
  <text start="1729.3" dur="5.66">you down this is where they are headed</text>
  <text start="1731.97" dur="5.1">they don&amp;#39;t want people out there</text>
  <text start="1734.96" dur="4.54">contradicting whatever the government</text>
  <text start="1737.07" dur="4.65">says it causes a lot of problems for</text>
  <text start="1739.5" dur="3.6">them they can&amp;#39;t keep their story</text>
  <text start="1741.72" dur="3.9">straight and they can&amp;#39;t push their</text>
  <text start="1743.1" dur="8">agendas it&amp;#39;s very very difficult for</text>
  <text start="1745.62" dur="9.48">them now Edward Snowden came out with a</text>
  <text start="1751.1" dur="5.71">more leaks from the NSA and these leaked</text>
  <text start="1755.1" dur="3.93">docs show that the NSA and central</text>
  <text start="1756.81" dur="5.04">security service rely on cooperative and</text>
  <text start="1759.03" dur="5.28">in some cases contractual relations with</text>

  <text start="1764.31" dur="4.14">wiretapping and data stockpiling</text>
  <text start="1766.5" dur="3.75">activities now we already understand</text>

  <text start="1770.25" dur="4.56">corporations and of course everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1771.75" dur="5.52">denying it saying no no we we don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1774.81" dur="4.71">that I mean now we see there&amp;#39;s firmware</text>
  <text start="1777.27" dur="5.43">on hard drives where they can bypass the</text>
  <text start="1779.52" dur="5.04">operating system listen in on everything</text>
  <text start="1782.7" dur="4.2">without even your computer being on</text>
  <text start="1784.56" dur="4.74">without your phones being on they can do</text>
  <text start="1786.9" dur="4.92">the same thing and we see that there are</text>
  <text start="1789.3" dur="5.61">a couple facts here from this new leaked</text>
