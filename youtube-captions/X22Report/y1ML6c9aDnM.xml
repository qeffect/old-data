  <text start="139.33" dur="4.98">another modest increase but we are at</text>
  <text start="142.27" dur="5.31">30-year low stills it&amp;#39;s going absolutely</text>
  <text start="144.31" dur="5.34">nowhere maybe a lot of these people who</text>
  <text start="147.58" dur="4.29">are out of work saying listen I have to</text>
  <text start="149.65" dur="4.71">get something and I&amp;#39;m going to stop</text>
  <text start="151.87" dur="4.83">looking for these high paying jobs that</text>
  <text start="154.36" dur="4.35">you know that I had before and I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="156.7" dur="5.43">going to have to go bar 10 I&amp;#39;m going to</text>

  <text start="162.13" dur="4.95">have to get two or three of these just</text>
  <text start="164.5" dur="6.06">make ends meet so they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="167.08" dur="6.93">convince everyone that we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="170.56" dur="5.25">incredible recovery and we see the</text>
  <text start="174.01" dur="5.73">unemployment rate it dropped down to</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="6.89">four point nine percent but when we look</text>
  <text start="179.74" dur="9.9">closely at these numbers what do we see</text>
  <text start="182.7" dur="10.15">we see that yes we added jobs and a lot</text>
  <text start="189.64" dur="5.09">of the jobs about 47,000 of them were in</text>
  <text start="192.85" dur="4.85">food services and drinking places</text>
  <text start="194.73" dur="6.13">waiters and bartenders in other words</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="8.53">seventy percent of the job gains in</text>
  <text start="200.86" dur="10.29">January went to minimum wage workers not</text>
  <text start="206.23" dur="9.63">to manufacturing not to construction not</text>
  <text start="211.15" dur="7.589">to these high paying jobs so we have an</text>
  <text start="215.86" dur="4.349">update and every time the job numbers</text>
  <text start="218.739" dur="4.321">come out we compare what happened to</text>
  <text start="220.209" dur="8.581">manufacturing to waiters and bartenders</text>
  <text start="223.06" dur="8.929">and we see that since 2007 we have lost</text>
  <text start="228.79" dur="6.63">about 1.4 million manufacturing jobs and</text>
  <text start="231.989" dur="7.391">those have been replaced by 1.6 million</text>
  <text start="235.42" dur="6.3">which it used to be 1.5 million waiter</text>
  <text start="239.38" dur="4.859">and bartender jobs now am I saying these</text>
  <text start="241.72" dur="3.829">jobs are terrible know if you want a</text>
  <text start="244.239" dur="3.271">waiter and bartender that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="5.111">actually there&amp;#39;s a lot of good cash in</text>
  <text start="247.51" dur="8.069">it for for those people who had jobs</text>
  <text start="250.66" dur="7.56">making 80 90 100 110 thousand these are</text>
  <text start="255.579" dur="5.851">not the jobs they were looking for these</text>
  <text start="258.22" dur="6.33">are not the jobs they wanted they wanted</text>
  <text start="261.43" dur="4.89">jobs equal to or greater than what they</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="3.39">had maybe even a little bit lower if you</text>
  <text start="266.32" dur="5.55">were making a tea would you accept</text>
  <text start="267.94" dur="8.479">something 75 70 of course but we can see</text>
  <text start="271.87" dur="7.2">right now that this job market is</text>
  <text start="276.419" dur="5.801">completely falling apart we know</text>
  <text start="279.07" dur="5.64">challenger grain Christmas they came out</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="4.71">with their layoffs and we know since</text>
  <text start="284.71" dur="5.31">december two hundred and eighteen</text>
  <text start="286.93" dur="5.97">percent increase layoffs from december</text>
  <text start="290.02" dur="4.68">to january yes a lot of these jobs most</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="4.47">likely were part-time jobs during the</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="3.51">holiday season but if we go back a year</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="5.639">ago</text>
  <text start="298.21" dur="7.53">back to January of 2015 we&amp;#39;re forty-two</text>
  <text start="303.009" dur="5.101">percent lower than that this is not a</text>
  <text start="305.74" dur="4.17">good start to this year because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.11" dur="4.77">telling us the unemployment rate is at</text>
  <text start="309.91" dur="5.15">four point nine percent so something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.88" dur="4.23">wrong I mean there&amp;#39;s 94 million</text>
  <text start="315.06" dur="4.99">Americans not in the labor force right</text>
