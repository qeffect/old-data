  <text start="147.53" dur="5.8">so what really happened here well retail</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="4.11">sales they rose around 1.6 percent in</text>
  <text start="153.33" dur="4.32">September from August that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="5.07">one-month surge the largest since march</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="4.83">of 2015 and it appeared after retail</text>
  <text start="160.35" dur="3.48">sales in August had edged down about 0.1</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="4.589">percent from July</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="5.61">it looks like the sales figures they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.069" dur="3.991">based undated that has been adjusted for</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="4.29">seasonal variation and holiday and</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="5.399">trading day differences but not for</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="6.27">price changes as the commerce department</text>
  <text start="176.459" dur="7.081">says so in short this is a seasonally</text>
  <text start="180" dur="6.87">adjusted month among data and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="3.81">pretty much it so what happened well not</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="2.88">a</text>
  <text start="187.35" dur="6.12">for seasonal and calendar differences</text>
  <text start="189.75" dur="7.41">retail sales actually dropped by twenty</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="8.25">three billion dollars or 4.8 percent</text>
  <text start="197.16" dur="7.89">from august so when we really look at</text>
  <text start="201.72" dur="5.25">this they manipulated the data and they</text>
  <text start="205.05" dur="2.82">convinced us that retail sales were</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="4.35">doing a lot better</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="6.69">seasonally adjusted data is only as good</text>
  <text start="211.32" dur="6.18">as the seasonal adjustments and they</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="5.88">made some hefty adjustments adjustments</text>
  <text start="217.5" dur="4.59">to this data and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="220.44" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for a very long</text>
  <text start="222.09" dur="4.8">time and if we look at the chart we can</text>
  <text start="223.74" dur="6.48">see that basically retail sales they</text>
  <text start="226.89" dur="4.89">have dropped significantly and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.22" dur="3.87">trying to convince us that everything is</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="5.13">fun remember how they really calculate</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="5.52">everything well they don&amp;#39;t take the</text>
  <text start="236.91" dur="4.44">stores information right off the bat if</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="3.6">they don&amp;#39;t get the stores information</text>
  <text start="241.35" dur="4.62">what do they do they estimate everything</text>
  <text start="243.21" dur="5.7">if stores are closing they take that</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="4.59">information and they adjust it over many</text>
  <text start="248.91" dur="3.81">many months they don&amp;#39;t say ok all the</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="4.59">stores just closed down so those sales</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="3.72">just stopped and we&amp;#39;re just going to cut</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="4.08">those sales out of the picture that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="4.59">not what they do they basically put it</text>
  <text start="259.23" dur="3.27">over many many months and make it look</text>
  <text start="261.03" dur="4.47">like it&amp;#39;s doing a lot better than it</text>
  <text start="262.5" dur="5.82">really is and we see right now when we</text>
  <text start="265.5" dur="5.88">look at the retail sales they are not</text>
  <text start="268.32" dur="6.48">doing well whatsoever now people are</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="5.91">wondering why housing is not doing well</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="6.3">why retail is not doing well why the</text>
  <text start="277.29" dur="5.19">economy is not doing as well as the</text>
  <text start="281.1" dur="3.69">corporate media the government the Fed</text>
  <text start="282.48" dur="4.77">have been telling us well there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="284.79" dur="5.34">new study by Pew Research and they</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="4.32">isolated the big biggest factor of why</text>
  <text start="290.13" dur="3.12">people aren&amp;#39;t going out and buying</text>
  <text start="291.57" dur="2.4">houses why people aren&amp;#39;t getting married</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="3.75">right now</text>
  <text start="293.97" dur="7.4">why retail sales aren&amp;#39;t doing well what</text>
  <text start="297" dur="7.8">they&amp;#39;ve figured out is the Millennials</text>
  <text start="301.37" dur="5.77">they&amp;#39;re delaying marriage they are not</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="4.44">buying houses they&amp;#39;re not going out and</text>
  <text start="307.14" dur="6.27">purchasing goods because why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="309.24" dur="6.39">making less money they&amp;#39;re not making</text>
  <text start="313.41" dur="5.9">enough money or many of these</text>
  <text start="315.63" dur="5.939">individuals can&amp;#39;t even find a job and</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="3.639">there&amp;#39;s a lot less people</text>
  <text start="321.569" dur="4.201">getting married and a lot more people</text>
  <text start="322.949" dur="4.44">living with their parents and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.77" dur="3.78">very interesting about all this is that</text>
  <text start="327.389" dur="4.31">the number of Americans living alone it</text>
  <text start="329.55" dur="4.799">has risen since the financial crisis as</text>
  <text start="331.699" dur="4.81">the global economy right now is</text>
  <text start="334.349" dur="4.29">completely struggling to return to a pre</text>
  <text start="336.509" dur="5.22">crisis growth rate which will never</text>
  <text start="338.639" dur="5.191">happen when we look at the number of</text>
  <text start="341.729" dur="4.261">Americans within living without a spouse</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="4.739">or a partner or anything like that</text>
  <text start="345.99" dur="4.709">it has climbed to 42 percent and many of</text>
  <text start="348.569" dur="5.46">these individuals are saying that listen</text>
  <text start="350.699" dur="4.8">their salary is not where it should be</text>
  <text start="354.029" dur="3.331">or they have a part time where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="355.499" dur="3.931">living with their parents and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="4.47">have the ability to go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="5.34">a home start a family go out and</text>
  <text start="361.83" dur="5.129">purchase retail and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="364.77" dur="4.919">see that this is really starting to have</text>
  <text start="366.959" dur="4.14">an effect on the global economy right</text>
  <text start="369.689" dur="3.741">now and it&amp;#39;s just going to get worse</text>
  <text start="371.099" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s not going to improve whatsoever I</text>
  <text start="373.43" dur="5.469">don&amp;#39;t in Cuba we see that this sonic</text>
  <text start="377.159" dur="3.36">blast well people are starting to</text>
  <text start="378.899" dur="3.66">question this scientists are starting to</text>
  <text start="380.519" dur="4.531">question this and they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="382.559" dur="3.72">this saying well through research and</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="3.75">through everything that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="386.279" dur="6.06">looking at they don&amp;#39;t believe that this</text>
  <text start="388.8" dur="4.979">was a sonic attack they believe that</text>
  <text start="392.339" dur="3.69">this might have been something</text>
  <text start="393.779" dur="4.74">completely different the actual sound</text>
  <text start="396.029" dur="6.271">that people heard were sounds of like a</text>
  <text start="398.519" dur="6">high-pitched cricket noise and at this</text>
  <text start="402.3" dur="4.319">point they&amp;#39;re still looking into it to</text>
  <text start="404.519" dur="6.02">find out exactly what it is now I</text>
  <text start="406.619" dur="6.21">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if the US or the</text>
  <text start="410.539" dur="5.29">intelligence agencies they were doing</text>
  <text start="412.829" dur="7.5">something in that area and maybe they</text>
  <text start="415.829" dur="8.31">were caught or it went bad and basically</text>
  <text start="420.329" dur="5.55">blamed it on Cuba and at this point we</text>
  <text start="424.139" dur="4.23">see there&amp;#39;s a lot of scientists looking</text>
  <text start="425.879" dur="6.09">at this and they can&amp;#39;t find any evidence</text>
  <text start="428.369" dur="6.09">that this was any type of sonic blast</text>
  <text start="431.969" dur="5.94">and we can see out in Afghanistan the</text>
  <text start="434.459" dur="5.67">war is continuing we see the US is going</text>
  <text start="437.909" dur="4.29">after the Islamic state just like in</text>
  <text start="440.129" dur="4.82">Syria we know the Cabal is on the other</text>
  <text start="442.199" dur="5.19">hand on the other side trying to keep</text>
  <text start="444.949" dur="3.76">Afghanistan and what&amp;#39;s happening here is</text>
  <text start="447.389" dur="4.291">all these countries that they&amp;#39;ve taken</text>
  <text start="448.709" dur="4.44">over they are losing these countries</text>
  <text start="451.68" dur="3.66">look at the Middle East it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="453.149" dur="4.291">falling apart everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="455.34" dur="4.14">everything they planned it is completely</text>
  <text start="457.44" dur="6.33">falling apart and right now we can see</text>
  <text start="459.48" dur="7.499">that the out in Afghanistan this mq-9</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="5.55">Reaper drone it was shot down and these</text>
  <text start="466.979" dur="4.051">drones can say airborne around up to</text>
  <text start="469.32" dur="4.319">about 36 hours</text>
  <text start="471.03" dur="5.91">they have 1.7 tons of missiles and bombs</text>
  <text start="473.639" dur="5.761">and there is the records the wreckage of</text>
  <text start="476.94" dur="4.89">the Reaper drone they do have evidence</text>
  <text start="479.4" dur="4.53">and they&amp;#39;re saying that they did shoot</text>
  <text start="481.83" dur="3.059">it down we see that Tillerson is out</text>
  <text start="483.93" dur="2.97">there saying that we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="484.889" dur="4.711">working on diplomacy with North Korea</text>
  <text start="486.9" dur="4.05">and it will continue until the first</text>
  <text start="489.6" dur="2.55">bomb drops</text>
  <text start="490.95" dur="3.33">now of course corporate media is going</text>
  <text start="492.15" dur="4.89">wild over there saying oh we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="494.28" dur="5.55">ready to drop a bomb on North Korea know</text>
  <text start="497.04" dur="4.95">what&amp;#39;s really happening is behind the</text>
  <text start="499.83" dur="4.5">scenes we have the EU in Korea South</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="4.35">Korea Russia China the US they are</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="5.07">working on a deal to calm the situation</text>
  <text start="506.34" dur="4.949">down and of course he&amp;#39;s saying all this</text>
  <text start="509.4" dur="5.1">because yeah there&amp;#39;s gonna be no</text>
  <text start="511.289" dur="5.071">negotiations if a bomb is dropped now he</text>
  <text start="514.5" dur="3.21">didn&amp;#39;t say the US was going to drop it</text>
  <text start="516.36" dur="3.239">he didn&amp;#39;t say North Korea was going to</text>
  <text start="517.71" dur="4.259">drop it he just said listen we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="519.599" dur="5.341">continue with the negotiations until</text>
  <text start="521.969" dur="4.56">something does happen now of course we</text>
  <text start="524.94" dur="3.69">know that the Cabal</text>
  <text start="526.529" dur="4.081">they&amp;#39;re going to try to push some type</text>
  <text start="528.63" dur="4.23">of an event and we see already that</text>
  <text start="530.61" dur="4.53">North Korea they&amp;#39;re threatening Guam</text>
  <text start="532.86" dur="4.169">with a salvo of missiles and we have to</text>
  <text start="535.14" dur="3.99">remember a lot of these reports and what</text>
  <text start="537.029" dur="5.301">they&amp;#39;re talking about is a lot of</text>
  <text start="539.13" dur="6.69">rhetoric going back and forth the u.s.</text>
  <text start="542.33" dur="5.379">North Korea remember the new the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="545.82" dur="4.37">coming in and they&amp;#39;re holding drills in</text>
  <text start="547.709" dur="4.771">this area North Korea doesn&amp;#39;t like this</text>
  <text start="550.19" dur="4.18">North Korea really doesn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="552.48" dur="4.08">missile systems to reach Guam I know</text>
  <text start="554.37" dur="4.44">they tried to prove it showing that they</text>
  <text start="556.56" dur="4.35">can fly a missile over Japan saying</text>
  <text start="558.81" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s enough distance to reach Guam but</text>
  <text start="560.91" dur="4.2">most of these missiles completely blow</text>
  <text start="563.4" dur="3.629">up fall apart and they actually don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="565.11" dur="4.56">even make it so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="567.029" dur="5.161">they&amp;#39;re just talking they&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="569.67" dur="4.789">back and forth telling each side what</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re going to do and at this point</text>
  <text start="574.459" dur="7.091">there&amp;#39;s no evidence whatsoever that the</text>
  <text start="578.37" dur="5.43">u.s. is going to be invading North Korea</text>
  <text start="581.55" dur="4.86">at all or North Korea is going to be</text>
  <text start="583.8" dur="5.099">firing a missile because if they did do</text>
  <text start="586.41" dur="5.94">this this would be a complete and</text>
  <text start="588.899" dur="5.521">under disaster and it it won&amp;#39;t go well</text>
  <text start="592.35" dur="5.549">because a lot of countries are going get</text>
  <text start="594.42" dur="5.339">to get involved and if North Korea has a</text>
  <text start="597.899" dur="4.651">nuclear weapon they&amp;#39;re going to use it</text>
  <text start="599.759" dur="4.531">in South Korea and this is not going to</text>
  <text start="602.55" dur="4.649">end well at all and I think China and</text>
  <text start="604.29" dur="5.7">Russia they are working very hard to</text>
  <text start="607.199" dur="4.32">calm the situation down right now we see</text>
  <text start="609.99" dur="4.529">the bill that they&amp;#39;re trying to pass</text>
  <text start="611.519" dur="5.581">right now in Congress where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="614.519" dur="4.651">going to have the president stopped</text>
  <text start="617.1" dur="6.479">supporting the Yemen war this is again</text>
  <text start="619.17" dur="8.089">bill number 81 and they want basically</text>
  <text start="623.579" dur="6.63">all weapons all support for Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="627.259" dur="5.56">to fight in Yemen they want this to come</text>
  <text start="630.209" dur="5.97">to an end and once again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632.819" dur="5.58">introducing this bill and they&amp;#39;re hoping</text>
  <text start="636.179" dur="4.111">that it will pass and it will force the</text>
  <text start="638.399" dur="3.571">President to stop what is going on there</text>
  <text start="640.29" dur="3.329">and if you notice what is happening</text>
  <text start="641.97" dur="4.049">around the Middle East right now is that</text>
  <text start="643.619" dur="4.681">every place where the Cabal was involved</text>
  <text start="646.019" dur="4.891">there&amp;#39;s no support anymore in Syria</text>

  <text start="666.829" dur="6.221">the Middle East is imploding on itself</text>
  <text start="670.74" dur="5.459">in the way that the Cabal does not have</text>
  <text start="673.05" dur="5.25">power anymore to do anything and Russia</text>
  <text start="676.199" dur="4.95">and China are definitely moving into</text>
  <text start="678.3" dur="4.68">these areas and at this point Russia and</text>
  <text start="681.149" dur="4.8">Iran are saying listen we need to work</text>

  <text start="700.709" dur="4.29">of the other coalition forces the</text>
  <text start="702.36" dur="4.229">intelligence agencies have been using to</text>
  <text start="704.999" dur="3.87">convince everyone that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="706.589" dur="3.98">terrorists out there now we see the</text>
  <text start="708.869" dur="4.44">Syrian army they&amp;#39;re preparing for a huge</text>
  <text start="710.569" dur="4.541">offensive in the Golan Heights area and</text>
  <text start="713.309" dur="3.09">of course Israel is going to have a</text>
  <text start="715.11" dur="3.269">problem with this so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="716.399" dur="3.721">watch this very very carefully we see</text>
  <text start="718.379" dur="3.96">that Syria is demanding immediate</text>
  <text start="720.12" dur="4.8">unconditional withdrawal of the terror</text>
  <text start="722.339" dur="4.381">supporting turkey from its territory and</text>
  <text start="724.92" dur="3.479">they&amp;#39;re gonna start making demands on</text>
  <text start="726.72" dur="3.179">all of these countries they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="728.399" dur="3.12">saying listen the United States the</text>
  <text start="729.899" dur="3.42">coalition forces you need to get out</text>
  <text start="731.519" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s no reason to be in there</text>
  <text start="733.319" dur="4.02">actually they were never invited in the</text>
  <text start="735.089" dur="3.841">country they invaded a country they</text>
  <text start="737.339" dur="3.151">never had permission from the elected</text>
  <text start="738.93" dur="4.68">government and we&amp;#39;re getting to the</text>
  <text start="740.49" dur="4.5">point where they&amp;#39;re gonna have to really</text>
  <text start="743.61" dur="2.88">make a decision of what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="744.99" dur="3.69">do because the world is looking now</text>
  <text start="746.49" dur="4.86">saying okay why are you there there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="748.68" dur="4.469">only eight percent of the terrorist</text>
  <text start="751.35" dur="6.959">group left and now you need to remove</text>
  <text start="753.149" dur="7.471">yourself we see the Cabal is pushing the</text>
  <text start="758.309" dur="4.351">idea and they&amp;#39;re bringing in other</text>
  <text start="760.62" dur="3.93">countries like Iran right now because we</text>
  <text start="762.66" dur="3.539">can see there&amp;#39;s a huge push to get into</text>
  <text start="764.55" dur="3.12">war with Iran remember this was the last</text>
  <text start="766.199" dur="3.3">country they wanted to get into have</text>
  <text start="767.67" dur="3.2">regime change they also want to try to</text>
  <text start="769.499" dur="4.31">push something with North Korea so</text>
  <text start="770.87" dur="5.259">everything that we heard about</text>
  <text start="773.809" dur="4.33">cyberattacks and all this stuff they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="776.129" dur="4.62">shifting the blame now to Iran now</text>
  <text start="778.139" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re saying that Iran was responsible</text>
  <text start="780.749" dur="6.84">for a cyberattack on Parliament that hit</text>
  <text start="783.629" dur="6.541">dozens of MPs emails their computer</text>
  <text start="787.589" dur="4.44">system including Theresa May now</text>
  <text start="790.17" dur="3.93">originally they thought it was Russia</text>
  <text start="792.029" dur="3.99">then they found evidence that it was</text>
  <text start="794.1" dur="4.14">Iran and they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s 9000</text>
  <text start="796.019" dur="4.56">email accounts were affected again what</text>
  <text start="798.24" dur="5.279">would be the motive to do this at this</text>
  <text start="800.579" dur="7.411">point it makes no sense and again any</text>
  <text start="803.519" dur="7.38">state actor attacking another country</text>
  <text start="807.99" dur="5.88">why would they do it and leave bread</text>
  <text start="810.899" dur="4.891">crumbs it&amp;#39;s very easy to bounce it off</text>
  <text start="813.87" dur="4.829">other servers have no evidence</text>
  <text start="815.79" dur="5.279">whatsoever and we know that the CIA FBI</text>
  <text start="818.699" dur="4.32">and all the other intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="821.069" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;ve been using vault seven where</text>
  <text start="823.019" dur="2.88">they can make it look like it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="824.519" dur="3.38">from someplace else</text>
  <text start="825.899" dur="3.271">they&amp;#39;re also saying they wanna cry</text>
  <text start="827.899" dur="3.25">attack</text>
  <text start="829.17" dur="5.099">they thought it was Russia but they</text>
  <text start="831.149" dur="5.43">found out that no it is North Korea so</text>
  <text start="834.269" dur="8.101">think about what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="836.579" dur="8.7">they&amp;#39;re trying to push war any way they</text>
  <text start="842.37" dur="4.74">possibly can and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="845.279" dur="4.081">with high confidence with great</text>
  <text start="847.11" dur="4.05">confidence that it wasn&amp;#39;t Russia they</text>
  <text start="849.36" dur="4.589">really have evidence now that it was</text>
  <text start="851.16" dur="4.66">North Korea and once again they&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="853.949" dur="4.411">gonna find out you know how hard it</text>
  <text start="855.82" dur="5.49">to track down who really did something</text>
  <text start="858.36" dur="5.77">because you don&amp;#39;t originate the attack</text>
  <text start="861.31" dur="5.61">from your country you don&amp;#39;t put evidence</text>
  <text start="864.13" dur="5.91">in the code that you&amp;#39;re using it makes</text>
  <text start="866.92" dur="5.01">no sense and what they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="870.04" dur="4.08">now is they&amp;#39;re grasping for anything</text>
  <text start="871.93" dur="5.45">they possibly can to make it look like</text>
  <text start="874.12" dur="5.64">Iran and North Korea or even Russia</text>
  <text start="877.38" dur="4.63">they&amp;#39;re cyber attacking because remember</text>
  <text start="879.76" dur="5.04">if they use a cyberattack</text>
  <text start="882.01" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s very easy to say yes we were</text>
  <text start="884.8" dur="3.57">cyberattack we don&amp;#39;t to show you any</text>
  <text start="886.45" dur="4.02">evidence we can just come out on the</text>
  <text start="888.37" dur="3.81">corporate media and tell you that this</text>
  <text start="890.47" dur="3.09">was the country where it came from and</text>
  <text start="892.18" dur="4.32">this is why we need to go to war</text>
  <text start="893.56" dur="6.63">remember NATO right now the u.s. a cyber</text>
  <text start="896.5" dur="5.43">attack is a declaration of war and I</text>
  <text start="900.19" dur="2.97">think they&amp;#39;re going down this path right</text>
  <text start="901.93" dur="3.9">now and this is why they&amp;#39;re building the</text>
  <text start="903.16" dur="5.04">propaganda that North Korea and Iran</text>
  <text start="905.83" dur="5.19">this is what they&amp;#39;re doing and once</text>
  <text start="908.2" dur="4.83">again I think we&amp;#39;re getting prepped for</text>
  <text start="911.02" dur="3.9">the next event and I think the next</text>
  <text start="913.03" dur="3.69">event is imminent because I think the</text>
  <text start="914.92" dur="3.3">Cabal their backs are against the wall</text>
  <text start="916.72" dur="3.69">they have nowhere else to turn and</text>
  <text start="918.22" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re pushing the propaganda very very</text>
  <text start="920.41" dur="5.13">hard and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if we</text>
  <text start="922.99" dur="4.2">see something very soon listen everyone</text>
