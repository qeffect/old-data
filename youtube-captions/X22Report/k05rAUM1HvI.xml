  <text start="115.25" dur="6.659">central bankers their backs are against</text>
  <text start="118.009" dur="7.89">the wall they&amp;#39;ve been trying to gain</text>
  <text start="121.909" dur="6.121">control of the narrative and what is</text>
  <text start="125.899" dur="4.53">happening here is they&amp;#39;re losing control</text>
  <text start="128.03" dur="4.89">the narrative we know that Trump he has</text>
  <text start="130.429" dur="4.53">the magic wand we know that he has the</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="3.48">ability to manipulate just like the</text>
  <text start="134.959" dur="4.62">central bank just like the deep state</text>
  <text start="136.4" dur="6.21">and he&amp;#39;s using all of this to his</text>
  <text start="139.579" dur="5.19">advantage to keep the economic system</text>
  <text start="142.61" dur="4.71">going for a little bit longer while in</text>

  <text start="150.079" dur="6.241">believe he&amp;#39;s working with Putin working</text>
  <text start="152.51" dur="8.22">with Xi Jinping to bring down the Roth&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="156.32" dur="7.62">child sent remaining system and we know</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="4.29">that the IMF we know that the central</text>
  <text start="163.94" dur="2.61">banks and</text>
  <text start="165.02" dur="3.87">certain financial planets are out there</text>
  <text start="166.55" dur="7.11">saying that the growth around the world</text>
  <text start="168.89" dur="8.64">is slowing because of tariffs well the</text>
  <text start="173.66" dur="5.76">central banks they were exposed and the</text>
  <text start="177.53" dur="5.58">information coming out of the World Bank</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="7.74">shows that the slowing growth has</text>
  <text start="183.11" dur="7.98">nothing to do with tariffs with Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.16" dur="5.67">policies it has to do with debt and</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that in just a</text>
  <text start="192.83" dur="4.08">minute but first I wanted to start off</text>
  <text start="194.6" dur="4.59">with Sears as we know that many retail</text>
  <text start="196.91" dur="5.1">chains they have been shutting down</text>
  <text start="199.19" dur="4.38">declaring bankruptcy and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="202.01" dur="5.88">to see that this is starting to spread</text>
  <text start="203.57" dur="6.09">big-time of course as we know the FICO</text>
  <text start="207.89" dur="4.47">scores have been changed a lot of people</text>
  <text start="209.66" dur="4.56">use debt to pay for the holiday season</text>
  <text start="212.36" dur="5.07">of course those bills are gonna come due</text>
  <text start="214.22" dur="5.85">and remember the central banks they have</text>
  <text start="217.43" dur="6.33">brainwashed the entire world population</text>
  <text start="220.07" dur="8.4">into thinking that debt is a good thing</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="7.23">and if you are in debt well that&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="228.47" dur="6.21">but if you can&amp;#39;t pay debt you&amp;#39;re a bad</text>
  <text start="230.99" dur="5.94">person and they&amp;#39;ve done this over time</text>
  <text start="234.68" dur="6.15">to make you believe that you owe them</text>
  <text start="236.93" dur="6.57">something but we owe them nothing we</text>
  <text start="240.83" dur="5.43">need to understand that the central bank</text>
  <text start="243.5" dur="6.27">system their entire system is about</text>
  <text start="246.26" dur="5.25">control putting fear into people and</text>
  <text start="249.77" dur="5.04">this is what they&amp;#39;ve done for a very</text>
  <text start="251.51" dur="6.63">long time but that&amp;#39;s about to end</text>
  <text start="254.81" dur="6.929">now as we said Sears they&amp;#39;re closing</text>
  <text start="258.14" dur="5.07">about 80 more stores across the u.s. in</text>
  <text start="261.739" dur="3.631">early 2019</text>
  <text start="263.21" dur="5.82">they closed about 140 stores back in</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="6.299">October and they declared chapter 11</text>
  <text start="269.03" dur="4.83">bankruptcy and we can see that they</text>
  <text start="271.669" dur="3.931">might not be operational for much much</text>
  <text start="273.86" dur="3.57">longer just like many other stores</text>
  <text start="275.6" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re just completely closing down</text>
  <text start="277.43" dur="5.4">left and right now remember the American</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="6.65">people their wages really haven&amp;#39;t gone</text>
  <text start="282.83" dur="4.95">up people have lost their high-paying</text>
  <text start="286.48" dur="3.22">jobs</text>
  <text start="287.78" dur="4.05">Manufacturing has been moved out of the</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="4.23">United States yes Trump is trying to get</text>
  <text start="291.83" dur="3.78">it slowly brought back to United States</text>
  <text start="293.93" dur="4.829">but this is going to take some time and</text>
  <text start="295.61" dur="5.88">people most of the population have</text>
  <text start="298.759" dur="4.56">low-paying or part-time jobs and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="301.49" dur="2.639">talking about the bulk of the</text>
  <text start="303.319" dur="4.47">middle-class</text>
  <text start="304.129" dur="5.94">as we can see manufacturing well it is</text>
  <text start="307.789" dur="4.201">declining right now it&amp;#39;s going to take</text>
  <text start="310.069" dur="4.051">some time for Trump to bring the</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="4.079">manufacturing base back to the United</text>
  <text start="314.12" dur="4.319">States remember he&amp;#39;s only been office</text>
  <text start="316.069" dur="5.91">for two years the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="318.439" dur="6.63">bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ve had since 1913 to move</text>
  <text start="321.979" dur="5.071">everything out of the country and of</text>
  <text start="325.069" dur="3.99">course it accelerated right after World</text>
  <text start="327.05" dur="4.979">War two and then it really accelerated</text>
  <text start="329.059" dur="5.85">in the 70s and this is when they started</text>
  <text start="332.029" dur="5.85">to prepare everything to change what we</text>
  <text start="334.909" dur="4.62">have today but Trump is using everything</text>
  <text start="337.879" dur="2.88">the deep State and the central banks</text>
  <text start="339.529" dur="4.021">have used in the past to keep the</text>
  <text start="340.759" dur="6.24">economy moving along if we go back to</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="7.739">when Obama was president he had Saudi</text>
  <text start="346.999" dur="6.39">Arabia push out as much oil as possible</text>
  <text start="351.289" dur="3.6">to bring down the gas prices now there</text>
  <text start="353.389" dur="5.161">were two agendas associated with this</text>
  <text start="354.889" dur="6.93">one to allow the American people to have</text>
  <text start="358.55" dur="6.51">more currency in their pocket to keep</text>
  <text start="361.819" dur="4.77">the economy operational they wanted the</text>
  <text start="365.06" dur="4.5">American people to go spend the money in</text>
  <text start="366.589" dur="5.01">retail really didn&amp;#39;t happen actually</text>
  <text start="369.56" dur="3.87">what happened was people said wham I</text>
  <text start="371.599" dur="3.66">have extra money in my pocket now I can</text>
  <text start="373.43" dur="4.65">pay for extra food now I can make my</text>
  <text start="375.259" dur="5.551">rent payment and that&amp;#39;s what happened</text>
  <text start="378.08" dur="5.489">during that period of time the other</text>
  <text start="380.81" dur="5.009">agenda is they were turning the screws</text>
  <text start="383.569" dur="5.88">on Russia and they were trying to hurt</text>
  <text start="385.819" dur="6">Russia&amp;#39;s economy the plan back then was</text>
  <text start="389.449" dur="6.39">to have war with Russia and they were</text>
  <text start="391.819" dur="7.051">hoping that by pushing out more and more</text>
  <text start="395.839" dur="5.82">oil because we know that Russia exports</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="5.279">oil it would hurt their economy but</text>
  <text start="401.659" dur="5.31">remember Putin took over the central</text>
  <text start="404.149" dur="5.281">bank Putin called the shots they paid</text>
  <text start="406.969" dur="5.49">off their debts and they were able to</text>
  <text start="409.43" dur="6.029">weather the storm and that agenda did</text>
  <text start="412.459" dur="9.811">not work and this was all being prepared</text>
  <text start="415.459" dur="12.381">for right now so Obama</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="8.73">he used the gas prices and lowered them</text>
  <text start="427.84" dur="5.71">to try to force the American people to</text>
  <text start="431" dur="4.77">go out and spend their money Trump right</text>
  <text start="433.55" dur="4.74">now tweeted out do you think it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="435.77" dur="5.67">luck that gas prices are so low and</text>
  <text start="438.29" dur="8.57">falling low gas prices are like another</text>
  <text start="441.44" dur="9.51">tax cut he&amp;#39;s using the same exact</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="8.08">strategy that the deep state and the</text>
  <text start="450.95" dur="5.61">central bankers have been using how do</text>
  <text start="454.94" dur="5.88">you allow the American people to</text>
  <text start="456.56" dur="7.38">continue one you lower the gas prices it</text>
  <text start="460.82" dur="4.17">puts more money into their wallet does</text>
  <text start="463.94" dur="3.48">this mean they&amp;#39;re gonna spend it on</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="4.8">retail most likely not it will allow</text>
  <text start="467.42" dur="7.28">them to survive a little bit longer</text>
  <text start="469.79" dur="9">Trump needs the economy moving along</text>
  <text start="474.7" dur="7.12">staying afloat long enough for him to</text>
  <text start="478.79" dur="6.21">complete the transition and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.82" dur="5.7">working on this in the background now</text>
  <text start="485" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="487.52" dur="5.73">corporate media the central bank the</text>
  <text start="491" dur="4.26">central bank around the world the IMF</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="6.11">the biz they&amp;#39;re continually out there</text>
  <text start="495.26" dur="6.93">telling us that the global growth is</text>
  <text start="499.36" dur="4.18">declining and it&amp;#39;s because of the</text>
  <text start="502.19" dur="4.26">tariffs and they keep mentioning the</text>
  <text start="503.54" dur="4.77">tariffs over and over and over again but</text>
  <text start="506.45" dur="6.03">a study by the World Bank found that if</text>
  <text start="508.31" dur="6.27">the debt to GDP ratio exceeds 77 percent</text>
  <text start="512.48" dur="5.88">for an extended period of time</text>
  <text start="514.58" dur="6.03">it slows economic growth every</text>
  <text start="518.36" dur="5.22">percentage point of debt above this</text>
  <text start="520.61" dur="5.82">level cost the country 1.7 percent in</text>
  <text start="523.58" dur="5.52">economic growth it&amp;#39;s even worse for</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="5.52">emerging markets and there is a tipping</text>
  <text start="529.1" dur="5.7">point now if we go to the World Bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.95" dur="6">page and we look at what they said this</text>
  <text start="534.8" dur="4.68">is what they said public debt has surged</text>
  <text start="537.95" dur="3.48">during the current global economic</text>
  <text start="539.48" dur="4.2">crisis and is expected to increase</text>
  <text start="541.43" dur="3.72">further this development has raised</text>
  <text start="543.68" dur="3.81">concerns whether the public debt is</text>
  <text start="545.15" dur="6.75">starting to hit levels where it might</text>
  <text start="547.49" dur="6.24">negatively affect economic growth does</text>
  <text start="551.9" dur="4.56">such a tipping point in public debt</text>
  <text start="553.73" dur="4.41">exists how severe</text>
  <text start="556.46" dur="3.09">with the impact of public debt beyond</text>
  <text start="558.14" dur="4.29">growth beyond the threshold</text>
  <text start="559.55" dur="4.62">what happens if debt stays above this</text>
  <text start="562.43" dur="4.23">threshold for an extended period of time</text>
  <text start="564.17" dur="4.14">the present study addresses these</text>
  <text start="566.66" dur="4.35">questions with the help of threshold</text>
  <text start="568.31" dur="4.2">estimations based on yearly data set of</text>
  <text start="571.01" dur="3.66">a hundred and one developing and</text>
  <text start="572.51" dur="5.4">developed economies spanning a time</text>
  <text start="574.67" dur="7.169">period from 1980 to 2008 the estimations</text>
  <text start="577.91" dur="7.799">established a threshold of 77% public</text>
  <text start="581.839" dur="6.271">debt to GDP ratio if debt is above this</text>
  <text start="585.709" dur="5.581">threshold each additional percentage</text>

  <text start="591.29" dur="6.6">percentage point of annual real growth</text>
  <text start="594.14" dur="8.73">if you look around the world a lot of</text>
  <text start="597.89" dur="9.09">countries have a very high percentage</text>
  <text start="602.87" dur="5.43">public debt to GDP ratio and if you look</text>
  <text start="606.98" dur="5.37">at many different nations around on a</text>
  <text start="608.3" dur="6.18">world Japan they have a 228 percent GDP</text>
  <text start="612.35" dur="5.91">debt to GDP ratio if you look at the</text>
  <text start="614.48" dur="7.229">United States its 100% debt to GDP ratio</text>
  <text start="618.26" dur="7.38">and this tells us something this tells</text>
  <text start="621.709" dur="6.811">us that the central bank system they are</text>
  <text start="625.64" dur="5.73">the ones who are responsible for the</text>
  <text start="628.52" dur="5.67">economic slowdown it&amp;#39;s not the tariffs</text>
  <text start="631.37" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s not Trump&amp;#39;s policies it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="634.19" dur="6.72">the central bank system now we need to</text>
  <text start="637.13" dur="7.2">remember Q has told us with post 2619</text>
  <text start="640.91" dur="6.869">that gold is going to bring down the Fed</text>
  <text start="644.33" dur="5.58">actually gold shall destroy the Fed and</text>
  <text start="647.779" dur="4.261">if we go back in time and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="649.91" dur="5.52">mentioned this before trump has</text>
  <text start="652.04" dur="6.21">mentioned that he really likes gold</text>
  <text start="655.43" dur="4.86">Trump said we used to have a very very</text>
  <text start="658.25" dur="6.45">solid country because it was based on a</text>
  <text start="660.29" dur="7.049">gold standard and he said this while he</text>
  <text start="664.7" dur="6.57">was doing an interview on WMUR in New</text>
  <text start="667.339" dur="5.431">Hampshire he also said in GQ bringing</text>
  <text start="671.27" dur="3.689">back the gold standard would be very</text>
  <text start="672.77" dur="4.71">hard to do but boy would it be wonderful</text>
  <text start="674.959" dur="6.541">we&amp;#39;d have a standard on which to base</text>
  <text start="677.48" dur="6.12">our money and what would happen if we</text>
  <text start="681.5" dur="4.709">brought back the gold standard we would</text>
  <text start="683.6" dur="4.38">see prosperity it would destroy the</text>

  <text start="702.71" dur="4.74">this was going to happen</text>
  <text start="704.09" dur="6.54">remember Trump was never supposed to win</text>
