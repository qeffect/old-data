  <text start="113.86" dur="5.16">this on anytime they want or in an</text>
  <text start="116.409" dur="4.741">advanced actor could access this malware</text>
  <text start="119.02" dur="4.739">and turn it on like the islamic state</text>
  <text start="121.15" dur="5.1">now they&amp;#39;re using all of this right now</text>
  <text start="123.759" dur="4.53">to convince us that this is going to be</text>
  <text start="126.25" dur="5.909">done by an outside actor and as we know</text>
  <text start="128.289" dur="6.87">this will be a false flag event to bring</text>
  <text start="132.159" dur="7.44">down the entire economy because as we</text>
  <text start="135.159" dur="5.461">know this economy is failing it is not</text>

  <text start="158.53" dur="5.37">the ability to do all of this and what</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="5.639">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is them build up</text>

  <text start="182.47" dur="3.269">it looks like they&amp;#39;re going after China</text>
  <text start="183.819" dur="3.301">and Russia right now as the advanced</text>
  <text start="185.739" dur="4.97">actors that could actually bring down</text>

  <text start="492.909" dur="6.021">initial claims and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="494.709" dur="6.48">that when these retail stores closed</text>
  <text start="498.93" dur="4.479">most of these people I would say a</text>
  <text start="501.189" dur="5.22">majority of them are part-time workers</text>

  <text start="765.6" dur="2.88">delinquencies continually rise now</text>
  <text start="767.28" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re going to do this with real</text>

  <text start="790.02" dur="6.36">this point and we are seeing this right</text>
  <text start="792.84" dur="6.99">now to push the auto industry up to push</text>
  <text start="796.38" dur="5.22">the real estate industry up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="799.83" dur="5.61">doing everything they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="801.6" dur="6.6">we have to realize that these</text>

  <text start="813.18" dur="6.09">continually declining they are not going</text>
  <text start="815.49" dur="4.92">up and when we look at this and we see</text>
  <text start="819.27" dur="3.87">what&amp;#39;s going on we understand that</text>

  <text start="832.44" dur="5.43">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>

  <text start="837.87" dur="4.62">right now are is unaffordable to</text>
  <text start="839.76" dur="6.9">Americans but what&amp;#39;s even more</text>
  <text start="842.49" dur="5.76">interesting is that Chinese inquiries</text>

  <text start="889.29" dur="5.04">American people are not purchasing these</text>

  <text start="896.97" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep this market alive</text>
  <text start="899.61" dur="3.15">but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to work I</text>
  <text start="901.17" dur="3.03">think eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="902.76" dur="3.84">is things are really going to start to</text>
  <text start="904.2" dur="4.5">fall apart very very quickly we realize</text>
  <text start="906.6" dur="4.02">that there are no loans being made in</text>
  <text start="908.7" dur="6.3">the banks they&amp;#39;ve laid off thousands</text>
  <text start="910.62" dur="6.57">upon thousands of mortgage mortgage</text>
  <text start="915" dur="3.72">people in their departments and we can</text>
  <text start="917.19" dur="3.48">see most of these investors are trying</text>
  <text start="918.72" dur="4.17">to rent out these homes and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="920.67" dur="3.99">having a huge problem the markets coming</text>
  <text start="922.89" dur="3">down prices are coming down and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.66" dur="2.61">getting a little bit nervous and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="925.89" dur="3.21">saying should we hold onto these homes</text>
  <text start="927.27" dur="3.36">or should we start selling them because</text>
  <text start="929.1" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re buying them at the high right now</text>
  <text start="930.63" dur="4.77">and it doesn&amp;#39;t look good and again I</text>
  <text start="933.15" dur="5.1">looked around the country and I am</text>
  <text start="935.4" dur="3.9">seeing homes coming down in price like</text>
  <text start="938.25" dur="4.04">50,000</text>
  <text start="939.3" dur="6.06">hundred thousand they&amp;#39;re reducing it</text>
  <text start="942.29" dur="5.89">once twice three times now again each</text>
  <text start="945.36" dur="4.8">area is different and I&amp;#39;m looking at</text>
  <text start="948.18" dur="5.099">different areas like in New York in the</text>
  <text start="950.16" dur="5.01">South in California and each area will</text>
  <text start="953.279" dur="4.891">be different but eventually what will</text>
  <text start="955.17" dur="6.62">happen just like in 2007-2008 it will</text>
  <text start="958.17" dur="6.78">catch up and everyone will feel the pain</text>
  <text start="961.79" dur="5.38">now there is a question out there if the</text>
  <text start="964.95" dur="5.55">economy is recovering why is there a</text>
  <text start="967.17" dur="5.49">surge in homeless children the National</text>

  <text start="1023.63" dur="5.039">time work right now and it is very very</text>
  <text start="1025.76" dur="4.86">hard to maintain that level once this</text>
  <text start="1028.669" dur="4.351">happens and it&amp;#39;s affecting a lot of</text>
  <text start="1030.62" dur="5.699">people out there but don&amp;#39;t worry the</text>
  <text start="1033.02" dur="6.48">government realizes this and they</text>
  <text start="1036.319" dur="5.701">decided they should tax everyone and it</text>
  <text start="1039.5" dur="6.419">looks like there&amp;#39;s a bill which is going</text>
  <text start="1042.02" dur="6.03">to be introduced into uh in the Senate</text>
  <text start="1045.919" dur="3.421">which is the wrong place where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1048.05" dur="3.69">supposed to be introduced because under</text>

  <text start="2257.48" dur="5.91">unbelievable now it seems like there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2261.8" dur="3.21">little bit of propaganda out there and</text>
  <text start="2263.39" dur="3.9">it seems like they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="2265.01" dur="4.06">that the Islamic state is getting their</text>
  <text start="2267.29" dur="3.64">weapons from Russia</text>
  <text start="2269.07" dur="3.93">and this is coming from Iraq where</text>
  <text start="2270.93" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re saying that some countries are</text>
  <text start="2273" dur="4.95">delivering weapons to the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="2275.01" dur="5.34">by using airplanes until a far airport</text>
  <text start="2277.95" dur="4.71">Russian aircraft filled with arms and</text>
  <text start="2280.35" dur="4.74">ammunition landed in Baghdad and then</text>
  <text start="2282.66" dur="4.68">they were rerouted and they landed until</text>
  <text start="2285.09" dur="5.4">afar and this is where the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="2287.34" dur="6.09">is getting their weapons and the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="2290.49" dur="4.89">people in this area are saying that the</text>
  <text start="2293.43" dur="3.99">US should come in and blow up the</text>
  <text start="2295.38" dur="3.48">airport now of course what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2297.42" dur="3.45">really trying to say and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2298.86" dur="4.11">trying to link this to is that the</text>
  <text start="2300.87" dur="3.63">Islamic state is part of Russia the</text>
  <text start="2302.97" dur="4.35">Islamic state since it&amp;#39;s part of Russia</text>
  <text start="2304.5" dur="4.5">Russia deals with Assad Assad then deals</text>
  <text start="2307.32" dur="3.57">with the Islamic state and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="2313.26" dur="3.9">doing everything they possibly can but</text>
  <text start="2315.63" dur="5.04">again this story makes no sense</text>
  <text start="2317.16" dur="5.97">whatsoever why would Russia go in there</text>
  <text start="2320.67" dur="6.06">and supply the Islamic state with</text>
  <text start="2323.13" dur="6.9">weapons Russia was friendly with Maliki</text>

  <text start="2330.03" dur="6.63">making deals together they&amp;#39;re friends</text>
  <text start="2333.18" dur="6.33">with Syria what would be the motivation</text>
  <text start="2336.66" dur="5.82">to have the Islamic state and supply</text>
  <text start="2339.51" dur="6.62">them with weapons to infiltrate Syria it</text>
  <text start="2342.48" dur="6.63">wouldn&amp;#39;t this is all propaganda now</text>
  <text start="2346.13" dur="10.32">there&amp;#39;s a report out there that says</text>
