  <text start="85.679" dur="6.3">starting to see is that we are seeing</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="5.76">cracks and the entire system now if you</text>
  <text start="91.979" dur="4.53">remember back to two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="5.039">prior to that actually people were</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="4.89">leaving their homes in California</text>
  <text start="98.789" dur="5.041">because the interest rates well they</text>
  <text start="101.399" dur="4.651">started to move up and many of the</text>
  <text start="103.83" dur="4.92">people had adjustable rate mortgages</text>
  <text start="106.05" dur="6.15">they couldn&amp;#39;t afford them people were</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="4.799">starting to lose jobs and instead of</text>
  <text start="112.2" dur="4.199">trying to sell their houses because</text>
  <text start="113.549" dur="5.43">there were no buyers they just left them</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="5.911">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see something like</text>
  <text start="118.979" dur="6.93">this in Vancouver and this is what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="5.85">talking about as we continue on here</text>
  <text start="125.909" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re going to see cracks in the economy</text>
  <text start="128.16" dur="4.23">the illusion is going to start to fall</text>
  <text start="129.959" dur="4.021">apart remember the administration that</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="4.08">is in the United States right now is</text>
  <text start="133.98" dur="7.8">leaving there&amp;#39;s a new administration</text>
  <text start="136.47" dur="8.91">coming in and they set this up to</text>
  <text start="141.78" dur="5.91">completely collapse during the next</text>
  <text start="145.38" dur="4.8">administration and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="4.38">point that the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="150.18" dur="4.17">government they are building upon this</text>
  <text start="152.07" dur="6.87">illusion to make you believe the economy</text>
  <text start="154.35" dur="7.47">is fantastic so when this administration</text>
  <text start="158.94" dur="4.26">leaves they can say ah you see we had</text>
  <text start="161.82" dur="3.9">everything the way it was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="163.2" dur="4.259">the globalists knew exactly how to take</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="4.44">care of the economy and look what</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="5.551">happened it completely crashed but in</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="6.93">Vancouver what we&amp;#39;re seeing well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="8.79">seeing the cracks and the real estate in</text>
  <text start="177.09" dur="6.36">Vancouver well the home sales they have</text>

  <text start="203.489" dur="5.341">see that houses are for sale Angela</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="5.15">Johnson who is a contributor to Wolfe</text>
  <text start="208.83" dur="6">Street who&amp;#39;s providing this information</text>
  <text start="211.4" dur="5.919">well they took some pictures and what</text>
  <text start="214.83" dur="6.21">they found was that there are</text>
  <text start="217.319" dur="6.901">neighborhoods with for sale signs all</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="5.61">over the place and none of these houses</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="4.32">are being sold just people are just</text>
  <text start="226.65" dur="4.83">trying to get rid of them but what the</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="4.77">problem is there&amp;#39;s no buyers so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="231.48" dur="4.92">starting to see cracks all over the</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="5.85">place remember we are hitting the top of</text>
  <text start="236.4" dur="7.02">the bubbles right now things are about</text>
  <text start="239.16" dur="6.299">to come down and as we watch this and as</text>
  <text start="243.42" dur="5.159">we track this and as we report on this</text>
  <text start="245.459" dur="5.9">we&amp;#39;re going to see more cracks as we go</text>
  <text start="248.579" dur="6.391">into January when the old administration</text>
  <text start="251.359" dur="7.991">leaves and the new administration comes</text>
  <text start="254.97" dur="8.819">in the illusion is going to start to rip</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="7.53">itself apart we see Deutsche Bank right</text>
  <text start="263.789" dur="5.401">now well we understand that they were</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="5.37">going to pay a 38 million dollar fine it</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="6.27">looks like the fine is up to 60 million</text>
  <text start="272.25" dur="6.12">now the 38 million was for silver</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="6.42">manipulation the additional fine is for</text>
  <text start="278.37" dur="9.32">rigging gold and having that manipulated</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="8.34">now of course a year ago two years ago</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="5.47">this would have been considered fake</text>
  <text start="290.22" dur="5.009">news where people were out there saying</text>
  <text start="293.16" dur="3.78">that gold and silver it has been</text>
  <text start="295.229" dur="3.961">completely manipulated actually going</text>
  <text start="296.94" dur="4.83">back further than that but the corporate</text>
  <text start="299.19" dur="3.78">media the US government they would have</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="3.78">been out there saying that&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="302.97" dur="4.86">fake that it&amp;#39;s fake news you have no</text>
  <text start="305.55" dur="6.03">proof whatsoever and here today the fake</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="5.55">news turns out to be true and the news</text>
  <text start="311.58" dur="3.149">that the corporate media and the</text>
  <text start="313.38" dur="3.6">government were putting out that there</text>
  <text start="314.729" dur="4.771">is no such thing as silver</text>
  <text start="316.98" dur="4.86">or gold precious metal manipulation well</text>
  <text start="319.5" dur="6.33">that turned out to be fake news once</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="5.46">again now in Venezuela we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="325.83" dur="6.05">people are having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="9.09">getting cash many Venezuelans they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="331.88" dur="8.5">had to go to multiple ATM machines just</text>
  <text start="336.39" dur="6.24">to get the currency they need one person</text>
  <text start="340.38" dur="6.27">says it takes almost six minutes for it</text>
  <text start="342.63" dur="8.1">to spit out 3,500 Boulevard at a shot</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="5.46">and they walk away with a huge stack but</text>
  <text start="350.73" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s really only worth five dollars and</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="5.87">thirty-two cents and what they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="355.32" dur="5.58">there is hyperinflation at this point</text>
  <text start="357.98" dur="5.41">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to get the currency</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="4.86">out of the ATM ATM machines because it</text>
  <text start="363.39" dur="4.77">runs out very very quickly there&amp;#39;s long</text>
  <text start="365.76" dur="4.68">lines to get food there&amp;#39;s long lines to</text>
  <text start="368.16" dur="5.55">get cash and the situation is</text>
  <text start="370.44" dur="5.64">deteriorating very very quickly and this</text>
  <text start="373.71" dur="7.59">is a glimpse into what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="8.16">see as the system collapses now the</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="6.03">corporate media they are setting the</text>
  <text start="384.24" dur="6.48">stage right now and we can see that more</text>
  <text start="387.33" dur="6.24">and more stories are coming out telling</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="7.14">us that the economy is fine there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="393.57" dur="8.87">story out of CNN and the story starts</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="8.79">off with Obama&amp;#39;s gift to trump a solid</text>
  <text start="402.44" dur="5.59">economy and they go through all the</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="3.84">statistics how they brought the</text>
  <text start="408.03" dur="6.81">unemployment down to four point six</text>
  <text start="410.49" dur="7.56">percent the GDP growth expanded to three</text>
  <text start="414.84" dur="6.05">point two percent the middle class is</text>
  <text start="418.05" dur="5.16">finally getting their pay raise and</text>
  <text start="420.89" dur="5.02">they&amp;#39;re going through all of this trying</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="5.49">to convince everyone that this economy</text>
  <text start="425.91" dur="5.94">is strong its robust but again these are</text>
  <text start="428.7" dur="7.68">statistical numbers they&amp;#39;re manipulated</text>
  <text start="431.85" dur="7.32">and like we said before we knew this is</text>
  <text start="436.38" dur="5.58">exactly what they were doing because we</text>
  <text start="439.17" dur="5.19">pointed out that Obama never had a GDP</text>
  <text start="441.96" dur="4.35">above three percent it just so happens</text>
  <text start="444.36" dur="2.91">at the end of his presidency all of a</text>
  <text start="446.31" dur="3.6">sudden the numbers were completely</text>
  <text start="447.27" dur="3.36">revised and he got his uh nuh-uh his GDP</text>
  <text start="449.91" dur="4.32">above</text>
  <text start="450.63" dur="5.61">of three percent and they&amp;#39;re playing on</text>
  <text start="454.23" dur="5.13">this because what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="456.24" dur="7.62">they&amp;#39;re setting the entire thing up for</text>
  <text start="459.36" dur="6.81">this great collapse Jill Stein is still</text>
  <text start="463.86" dur="4.71">out there pushing the recount this has</text>
  <text start="466.17" dur="6">nothing to do with the actual recount</text>
  <text start="468.57" dur="6.96">what it has to do with is manipulating</text>
  <text start="472.17" dur="6.21">the electoral votes stalling trying to</text>
  <text start="475.53" dur="6.39">keep those electoral votes out of the</text>
  <text start="478.38" dur="6.06">count during December nineteenth and we</text>
  <text start="481.92" dur="5.18">can see right now that the initial</text>
  <text start="484.44" dur="5.01">recount efforts in Pennsylvania well</text>
  <text start="487.1" dur="5.05">they&amp;#39;re not going too well and looks</text>
  <text start="489.45" dur="6">like Jule Stynes party is dropping the</text>
  <text start="492.15" dur="7.35">court case seeking a statewide recount</text>
  <text start="495.45" dur="8.13">of Pennsylvania and we see right now</text>
  <text start="499.5" dur="6.6">that during these recounts well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="503.58" dur="4.74">not really showing that there was a</text>
  <text start="506.1" dur="4.92">major problem at all now we&amp;#39;re in day</text>
  <text start="508.32" dur="7.02">two in Wisconsin and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="511.02" dur="7.56">is the following Clinton gained 89 votes</text>
  <text start="515.34" dur="7.02">but lost 86 FRA for net gain of three</text>
  <text start="518.58" dur="7.05">votes Trump gained 98 votes but lost 92</text>
  <text start="522.36" dur="7.37">for a net gain of six Clinton gained</text>
  <text start="525.63" dur="7.53">three overall Trump gained six overall</text>
  <text start="529.73" dur="8.14">so net truck gain of three votes on day</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="6.96">two and we can see right now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="537.87" dur="4.49">looking good for this entire recount and</text>
  <text start="540.12" dur="5.43">we know this recount is a complete scam</text>
  <text start="542.36" dur="8.26">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re using a</text>
  <text start="545.55" dur="9">backdoor method to show that no one got</text>
  <text start="550.62" dur="6.3">the electoral votes Hillary didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="554.55" dur="5.79">the electoral votes trumped and get the</text>
  <text start="556.92" dur="6.18">electoral votes so right now we need a</text>
  <text start="560.34" dur="4.74">decision of who is actually going to be</text>
  <text start="563.1" dur="5.31">the president this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="565.08" dur="5.82">trying to do now on November 30th the</text>

  <text start="927.89" dur="4.29">sanctions on Iran and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="929.93" dur="4.47">interesting about all of this is the</text>
  <text start="932.18" dur="5.19">statement says we believe the Iran</text>
  <text start="934.4" dur="5.73">sanctions act extension is not necessary</text>
  <text start="937.37" dur="6.27">but we also believe it wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="940.13" dur="6.27">interfere with the Iran deal now the</text>
  <text start="943.64" dur="6.06">question is any sanctions at this point</text>
  <text start="946.4" dur="5.45">would interfere with the Iranian deal</text>
  <text start="949.7" dur="6.6">and if you notice they use the word</text>
  <text start="951.85" dur="6.55">believe so they don&amp;#39;t have facts here</text>
  <text start="956.3" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re just trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="958.4" dur="4.5">that yeah this is not going to be a</text>
  <text start="960.8" dur="4.38">problem but of course the Iranians are</text>
  <text start="962.9" dur="4.77">going to see this as a problem now this</text>
  <text start="965.18" dur="4.38">is what they want to happen remember we</text>
  <text start="967.67" dur="5.22">talked about what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="969.56" dur="8.61">where they&amp;#39;re trying to maneuver Trump</text>
  <text start="972.89" dur="7.52">into a huge problem with Iran they</text>
  <text start="978.17" dur="5.07">already started with the missing</text>
  <text start="980.41" dur="3.849">radioactive material they already</text>
  <text start="983.24" dur="5.069">reported that</text>
  <text start="984.259" dur="8.16">I ran cyber attack Saudi Arabia and now</text>
  <text start="988.309" dur="6.661">the u.s. is placing sanctions on Iran</text>
  <text start="992.419" dur="5.7">and we&amp;#39;ll see if Obama goes through with</text>
  <text start="994.97" dur="6.029">this because at the time of the Iranian</text>
  <text start="998.119" dur="5.37">deal he was saying no no new sanctions</text>
  <text start="1000.999" dur="5.161">nothing like that remember they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1003.489" dur="4.77">want Iran developing a nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="1006.16" dur="6.419">because their plan was to go from Syria</text>
  <text start="1008.259" dur="7.8">into Iran now that plan we can see is</text>
  <text start="1012.579" dur="5.55">not working out so it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1016.059" dur="4.95">going back to sanctions and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1018.129" dur="6.27">working on a new plan but the goal is</text>
  <text start="1021.009" dur="6.69">always the same to get into Iran to get</text>
  <text start="1024.399" dur="5.25">into Syria start a war and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1027.699" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re proceeding with their other plan</text>
  <text start="1029.649" dur="7.02">we see ex president Hadi well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1033.429" dur="8.24">preparing an offensive on the coast of</text>
  <text start="1036.669" dur="8.13">Yemen it looks like the sound supported</text>
  <text start="1041.669" dur="6.04">president through the United States is</text>
  <text start="1044.799" dur="5.071">making a last-ditch effort to try to</text>
  <text start="1047.709" dur="4.621">seize control of Yemen now remember</text>
  <text start="1049.87" dur="4.71">China is coming in and they are working</text>
  <text start="1052.33" dur="4.41">now with the new hootie government and</text>
  <text start="1054.58" dur="5.61">it looks like that situation is falling</text>
  <text start="1056.74" dur="5.309">apart Ashton Carter is out there and</text>
  <text start="1060.19" dur="4.41">he&amp;#39;s saying even if we defeat the</text>
  <text start="1062.049" dur="4.711">Islamic state in Iraq in another</text>
  <text start="1064.6" dur="3.48">countries the US has to stay in all</text>
  <text start="1066.76" dur="3.57">these different countries in the Middle</text>
  <text start="1068.08" dur="4.77">East and of course they do because they</text>
  <text start="1070.33" dur="4.11">understand if they leave and the people</text>
  <text start="1072.85" dur="2.939">actually take over the countries and</text>
  <text start="1074.44" dur="3.75">they threw out the puppet governments</text>
  <text start="1075.789" dur="3.781">the petrodollar is doomed that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1078.19" dur="4.229">only reason they&amp;#39;re staying in these</text>
  <text start="1079.57" dur="4.709">countries and we see this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="1082.419" dur="5.701">do with the Islamic state they just</text>
  <text start="1084.279" dur="6.571">proved it we see the us-led coalition is</text>
  <text start="1088.12" dur="5.46">actually collapsing right now Denmark is</text>
  <text start="1090.85" dur="5.13">pulling their f16 jets out of the fight</text>
  <text start="1093.58" dur="5.819">and they&amp;#39;re looking into the situation</text>
  <text start="1095.98" dur="5.73">where on September 17th a number of</text>
  <text start="1099.399" dur="5.91">Syrian soldiers were killed with a u.s.</text>
  <text start="1101.71" dur="5.16">bombing of these soldiers and of course</text>
  <text start="1105.309" dur="3.181">the US is out there saying this was</text>
  <text start="1106.87" dur="3.87">actually a mistake we didn&amp;#39;t mean to do</text>
  <text start="1108.49" dur="4.439">this but again the Islamic state their</text>
  <text start="1110.74" dur="4.62">terrorist groups were in there and they</text>
  <text start="1112.929" dur="4.71">knew exactly when to push forward they</text>
  <text start="1115.36" dur="4.259">knew not to be in the area they</text>
  <text start="1117.639" dur="4.26">you a lot of information while these</text>
  <text start="1119.619" dur="4.081">bombings were going on and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1121.899" dur="3.68">starting to see that the coalition</text>
  <text start="1123.7" dur="5.939">forces they&amp;#39;re starting to break apart</text>
  <text start="1125.579" dur="7.84">now Lavrov is pushing the US right now</text>
  <text start="1129.639" dur="6.21">because Aleppo is basically done with</text>
  <text start="1133.419" dur="6.3">right now the US terrorist organization</text>
  <text start="1135.849" dur="5.21">they have no chance whatsoever so Lavrov</text>
  <text start="1139.719" dur="4.14">and Carrie they&amp;#39;re getting together</text>
  <text start="1141.059" dur="5.141">Lavrov want scary to event that yes</text>
  <text start="1143.859" dur="4.62">these are terrorist groups and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1146.2" dur="3.779">have to see what comes out of this most</text>
  <text start="1148.479" dur="4.19">of the time the u.s. goes into these</text>
  <text start="1149.979" dur="5.1">talks and they go back on their word</text>
  <text start="1152.669" dur="4.69">with everything they discuss with Russia</text>
  <text start="1155.079" dur="4.94">so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this actually</text>
  <text start="1157.359" dur="6.591">really turns out while this is happening</text>
  <text start="1160.019" dur="6.82">we see the u.s. is deploying additional</text>
  <text start="1163.95" dur="7.329">Marines and warships and they are</text>
  <text start="1166.839" dur="6.21">heading towards the Mediterranean the</text>

  <text start="1196.899" dur="5.97">that area for three months and the</text>
  <text start="1199.739" dur="4.69">question is what is their mission what</text>
  <text start="1202.869" dur="4.14">are they doing out there we understand</text>
  <text start="1204.429" dur="4.47">that Russia has its ships in the</text>
