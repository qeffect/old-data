  <text start="54.949" dur="6.57">French government decided to impose a</text>
  <text start="57.86" dur="7.229">state of emergency and basically it</text>
  <text start="61.519" dur="6.091">revokes the rights of the people and</text>
  <text start="65.089" dur="4.761">gives full power to the government well</text>

  <text start="212.989" dur="7.291">the Geneva 3 peace talks and right now</text>
  <text start="215.87" dur="8.339">we see that the Syrian opposition is now</text>
  <text start="220.28" dur="5.549">going to join the talks now a lot of</text>
  <text start="224.209" dur="4.31">people saying that these Geneva three</text>
  <text start="225.829" dur="6.421">talks have no future whatsoever because</text>
  <text start="228.519" dur="6.94">the agenda is basically the same as it</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="7.709">always been its Assad must step down</text>
  <text start="235.459" dur="6.24">Assad must step down and right now the</text>
  <text start="239.959" dur="3.571">only way a sign is stepping down is if</text>
  <text start="241.699" dur="4.44">the people decide okay we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="4.47">vote and we don&amp;#39;t we no longer want him</text>
  <text start="246.139" dur="3.24">as president but the United States</text>
  <text start="248" dur="4.56">government central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="249.379" dur="6.03">want to hear this they want him to step</text>
  <text start="252.56" dur="4.349">down now and if he doesn&amp;#39;t step down the</text>
  <text start="255.409" dur="4.38">war will continue we&amp;#39;ll have to watch</text>
  <text start="256.909" dur="5.431">these talks very closely to see what</text>
  <text start="259.789" dur="4.291">happens but I really don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.34" dur="3.15">gonna go anywhere I think in the</text>
  <text start="264.08" dur="4.38">meantime when everyone&amp;#39;s eyes are</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="5.85">focused on these ceasefire peace talks</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="4.949">the United States has other plans with</text>
  <text start="271.34" dur="5.43">the coalition forces building up the</text>
  <text start="273.409" dur="6.421">ground invasion preparing war in this</text>
  <text start="276.77" dur="5.04">area we see these Syrian rebels while</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="4.079">the peace talks are going on they</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="4.859">decided to merge with each other all the</text>
  <text start="283.909" dur="6.81">different factions into the northern</text>
  <text start="286.669" dur="7.86">brigade in Aleppo so we see they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="290.719" dur="5.101">starting to come together because once</text>
  <text start="294.529" dur="3.871">they all come together and they</text>
  <text start="295.82" dur="5.04">cooperate they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="298.4" dur="4.29">have this force which they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="300.86" dur="5.339">use with of course the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="302.69" dur="6.27">to go after Damascus burdwan is out</text>
  <text start="306.199" dur="6.871">there again and he&amp;#39;s making allegations</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="7.88">that an alleged incident involving an</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="7.53">su-34 fighter took place on Friday and</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="6.549">they&amp;#39;re saying that this plane flew into</text>
  <text start="320.6" dur="5.879">their airspace now Russia is out there</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="5.971">and they are denying the claims by</text>
  <text start="326.479" dur="8.211">Turkey saying absolutely not our plane</text>
  <text start="329.36" dur="8.13">to not violate your land whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="7.21">we need to see some type of proof</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="9.989">showing that it was our plane that went</text>
  <text start="341.9" dur="7.5">into your airspace please provide this</text>
  <text start="347.479" dur="4.891">now if they provide it and they show it</text>
  <text start="349.4" dur="5.78">great they have proof but if they</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="5.04">continually use accusations and</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="3.91">continually say this was done without</text>
  <text start="357.41" dur="7.17">giving the proof we know that this is</text>
  <text start="359.09" dur="8.759">complete propaganda now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.58" dur="6.14">seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="367.849" dur="5.671">provoke Russia into doing something and</text>
  <text start="370.72" dur="6.509">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this their net</text>
  <text start="373.52" dur="8.07">they&amp;#39;re not going to stop at this point</text>
  <text start="377.229" dur="6.041">now the Turkish ministry did not state</text>
  <text start="381.59" dur="3.449">where the alleged airspace violation</text>
  <text start="383.27" dur="5.19">occurred exactly they can&amp;#39;t give the</text>
  <text start="385.039" dur="6.091">exact location and Russia is saying that</text>
  <text start="388.46" dur="4.679">the turkish air defense specialists know</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="5.279">the radar stations controlling air space</text>
  <text start="393.139" dur="6.391">may only register the altitude course</text>
  <text start="396.409" dur="4.741">and speed of the object in the air none</text>
  <text start="399.53" dur="4.05">of these radars is capable of</text>
  <text start="401.15" dur="6.12">establishing the type and state</text>
  <text start="403.58" dur="5.73">affiliation of the air object so they</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="5.16">have no way of knowing that this wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="409.31" dur="5.01">actually an actual Russian plane all</text>
  <text start="412.43" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re saying is they quoted on radar</text>
  <text start="414.32" dur="6.3">and they are saying that yes it&amp;#39;s in our</text>
  <text start="417.86" dur="4.35">airspace and of course they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="420.62" dur="3.6">exactly where it is they&amp;#39;re not saying</text>
  <text start="422.21" dur="5.639">where it exactly is they have it handed</text>
  <text start="424.22" dur="7.94">over the satellite imagery the radar</text>
  <text start="427.849" dur="9.111">imagery they have none of it so right</text>
  <text start="432.16" dur="6.99">now they&amp;#39;re pushing propaganda why why</text>
  <text start="436.96" dur="3.84">are they doing all of this why are they</text>
  <text start="439.15" dur="4.62">provoking Russia like this because</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="6.21">what&amp;#39;s happening in Syria is that Russia</text>
  <text start="443.77" dur="7.26">has been pushing the Islamic state out</text>
  <text start="447.01" dur="6.09">of Syria Russia the Syrian army have</text>
  <text start="451.03" dur="4.86">been gaining ground they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="453.1" dur="5.64">liberating hundreds of towns and cities</text>
  <text start="455.89" dur="4.26">and the proxy army for the United States</text>
  <text start="458.74" dur="6.11">government central banker and Turkey</text>
  <text start="460.15" dur="7.86">they&amp;#39;re losing the oil revenue has</text>
  <text start="464.85" dur="5.53">basically completely disappeared because</text>
  <text start="468.01" dur="6.26">of what Russia has been doing they</text>
  <text start="470.38" dur="6.63">continually strike the oil convoys and</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="4.06">all that money that was flowing in and</text>
  <text start="477.01" dur="5.6">all that oil that was flowing into</text>
  <text start="478.33" dur="6.9">Turkey is coming to a complete halt and</text>
  <text start="482.61" dur="5.65">we see right now that United States</text>
  <text start="485.23" dur="5.22">government central bankers turkey the</text>
  <text start="488.26" dur="3.96">other coalition forces they are</text>
  <text start="490.45" dur="6.87">definitely preparing something very big</text>

  <text start="524.47" dur="7.32">spectrum of military operations and</text>
  <text start="528.36" dur="7.06">they&amp;#39;re going to be bombing there will</text>

  <text start="554.74" dur="3.18">propaganda that they&amp;#39;re going after the</text>
