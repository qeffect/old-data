  <text start="86.479" dur="7.761">it&amp;#39;s all happening at once what did we</text>
  <text start="90.68" dur="5.939">find out Theresa May she is resigning</text>
  <text start="94.24" dur="4.659">she announced that she will continue to</text>
  <text start="96.619" dur="5.25">lead the country until her replacement</text>

  <text start="110.78" dur="8.699">Farage&amp;#39;s party is expected to win and we</text>
  <text start="116.39" dur="6.899">understand and we know why Theresa May</text>
  <text start="119.479" dur="6.901">had to resign the people were out there</text>
  <text start="123.289" dur="7.261">and they were telling her what she what</text>
  <text start="126.38" dur="8.58">what they wanted but she was working for</text>
  <text start="130.55" dur="9.48">the EU not for the people Nigel Farage</text>
  <text start="134.96" dur="8.1">he said that may misjudged the mood of</text>
  <text start="140.03" dur="4.92">Britain translation she didn&amp;#39;t care what</text>
  <text start="143.06" dur="5.28">the people were saying and she went</text>
  <text start="144.95" dur="5.31">ahead with the e use plan period that</text>
  <text start="148.34" dur="5.7">was it because if she was truly</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="7.85">listening she would understand what they</text>
  <text start="154.04" dur="6.57">wanted and this is just the beginning</text>
  <text start="158.11" dur="5.65">now does this mean the central bank is</text>
  <text start="160.61" dur="3.99">done not yet remember the central bank</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="3.9">hold on and they like to control</text>
  <text start="166.79" dur="4.47">everything and they do it through fear</text>
  <text start="168.5" dur="5.25">if they can&amp;#39;t get their way with their</text>
  <text start="171.26" dur="3.3">type of negotiation which is their way</text>
  <text start="173.75" dur="3.66">or the highway</text>
  <text start="174.56" dur="4.5">they will then use events but we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="177.41" dur="4.83">to wait to see how this all turns out</text>
  <text start="179.06" dur="8.45">because if and when and I say when the</text>
  <text start="182.24" dur="7.89">UK leaves other countries within the EU</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="7.78">they&amp;#39;re going to watch and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="190.13" dur="10.89">to observe how the UK works everything</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="9.87">out and if the UK begins to prosper</text>
  <text start="201.02" dur="5.7">without the EU control guess what other</text>
  <text start="205.16" dur="2.94">countries are going to look at this and</text>
  <text start="206.72" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re gonna say you know something we</text>
  <text start="208.1" dur="4.29">want to do the same exact thing and</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="5.7">again this is their biggest fear their</text>
  <text start="212.39" dur="5">biggest fear is coming true think about</text>
  <text start="215.21" dur="4.74">what&amp;#39;s happening around the world</text>
  <text start="217.39" dur="7.24">everything they&amp;#39;re shifting the</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="7.29">globalist model is being dismantled the</text>
  <text start="224.63" dur="6.81">leaders are starting to realize they are</text>
  <text start="227.24" dur="7.23">losing control and they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="231.44" dur="6.87">realize that the people are gaining</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="5.19">control and once we have enough leaders</text>
  <text start="238.31" dur="4.77">around the country that are not</text>
  <text start="239.66" dur="6.9">controlled by the elite they can all</text>
  <text start="243.08" dur="5.73">band together and go after what yes</text>
  <text start="246.56" dur="6.36">the central bank because if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="5.76">go and pursue the destruction of the</text>
  <text start="252.92" dur="4.59">central bank the private western central</text>
  <text start="254.57" dur="5.64">bank system these countries are going to</text>
  <text start="257.51" dur="6.21">end up exactly where they were before</text>
  <text start="260.21" dur="7.86">and this is why they all need to band</text>
  <text start="263.72" dur="6.57">together and they need to push this very</text>
  <text start="268.07" dur="4.53">very quickly why because the central</text>
  <text start="270.29" dur="4.35">bank system it is falling apart right in</text>
  <text start="272.6" dur="3.3">front of our eyes I mean if you look at</text>
  <text start="274.64" dur="3.27">durable goods I mean we talked about</text>
  <text start="275.9" dur="4.11">housing we talked about all the other</text>
  <text start="277.91" dur="5.67">things if you look at durable goods</text>
  <text start="280.01" dur="5.37">well they slid by 2.1 percent they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.58" dur="4.02">only expecting it to slide by 2 percent</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="5.61">but it was much worse than they thought</text>
  <text start="287.6" dur="5.76">and the durable goods are these washers</text>
  <text start="290.99" dur="5.31">this is dryer the big-ticket items yes</text>
  <text start="293.36" dur="4.529">there&amp;#39;s also transportation and other</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="4.26">military stuff that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="297.889" dur="4.381">in this with butchers aircraft but when</text>
  <text start="300.56" dur="5.55">you really look at it and you strip away</text>
  <text start="302.27" dur="6.75">everything durable goods is absolutely</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="6.779">awful and this is the first time it went</text>
  <text start="309.02" dur="6.079">negative in 2019 so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="312.889" dur="4.261">here is that the central bank system is</text>
  <text start="315.099" dur="4.75">completely falling apart now very</text>
  <text start="317.15" dur="5.19">interestingly we know that Trump he is</text>
  <text start="319.849" dur="5.43">trying to make a deal with China is he</text>
  <text start="322.34" dur="6.569">in a rush no he has leverage he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.279" dur="7.17">pushing his agenda and he knows exactly</text>
  <text start="328.909" dur="5.69">what he wants in the end and he wants</text>
  <text start="332.449" dur="5.43">China to give now very interestingly</text>
  <text start="334.599" dur="4.81">China&amp;#39;s largest chip maker delisted from</text>
  <text start="337.879" dur="3.78">the New York Stock Exchange now they</text>
  <text start="339.409" dur="5.431">said well it didn&amp;#39;t trade that much was</text>
  <text start="341.659" dur="6.29">very expensive and the volume wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="344.84" dur="5.46">there so we&amp;#39;re gonna just remove it and</text>
  <text start="347.949" dur="4.75">they&amp;#39;re doing so we also see that</text>
  <text start="350.3" dur="5.489">Microsoft they are cutting ties with</text>
  <text start="352.699" dur="5.911">Huawei now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="355.789" dur="6.12">that there are many companies who&amp;#39;ve cut</text>
  <text start="358.61" dur="5.489">ties with Huawei already Google and many</text>
  <text start="361.909" dur="4.26">others and they were major of Japanese</text>
  <text start="364.099" dur="3.75">and British mobile carriers that say</text>
  <text start="366.169" dur="3.541">that they&amp;#39;re going to delay the</text>
  <text start="367.849" dur="5.63">releasing the new Huawei handsets as a</text>
  <text start="369.71" dur="7.189">result of the US sanctions so Huawei</text>
  <text start="373.479" dur="6.46">again is in the middle of everything and</text>
  <text start="376.899" dur="6.76">Trump is out there and this is the first</text>
  <text start="379.939" dur="6.061">time he linked Huawei with the trade</text>
  <text start="383.659" dur="5.82">talks and he says listen we might even</text>
  <text start="386" dur="6.779">include Huawei in our trade talks now</text>
  <text start="389.479" dur="6.511">think about what he&amp;#39;s done here they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="392.779" dur="7.89">been pointing at Huawei have arrested an</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="8.07">individual a higher-up and companies are</text>
  <text start="400.669" dur="5.851">backing off and now Trump is saying</text>
  <text start="404.06" dur="5.55">listen maybe with the negotiations we</text>
  <text start="406.52" dur="5.759">can use wha why do you think he planned</text>
  <text start="409.61" dur="6.269">this from the beginning to bring Huawei</text>
  <text start="412.279" dur="6.991">into the picture to use it as leverage</text>
  <text start="415.879" dur="5.4">to get what he wants it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="4.44">look that way and he said the following</text>
  <text start="421.279" dur="4.38">you look at what they&amp;#39;ve done from a</text>
  <text start="423.71" dur="4.59">security standpoint a military</text>
  <text start="425.659" dur="5.111">standpoint very dangerous that</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="5.35">notwithstanding there was a</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="4.829">good possibility Washington will reach</text>
  <text start="433.65" dur="4.59">an agreement with Beijing to end the</text>
  <text start="435.599" dur="6.181">escalating trade conflict and that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.24" dur="9.149">possible that Huawei would be included</text>
  <text start="441.78" dur="7.56">in a trade deal and it seems that this</text>
  <text start="447.389" dur="3.451">was planned out from the beginning</text>
  <text start="449.34" dur="3.87">because he knew that China was gonna</text>
  <text start="450.84" dur="5.759">push back on the things that he wanted</text>
  <text start="453.21" dur="6.359">and of course this benefits the United</text>
  <text start="456.599" dur="4.621">States right now Trump is making</text>
  <text start="459.569" dur="3.66">bilateral trade agreements with all</text>
  <text start="461.22" dur="4.56">different countries because once the</text>
  <text start="463.229" dur="6.03">petrodollar is completely gone we need</text>
  <text start="465.78" dur="5.94">to have good trade deals in place and</text>
  <text start="469.259" dur="5.22">this is what he&amp;#39;s working on right now</text>
  <text start="471.72" dur="6.87">he&amp;#39;s preparing the economy for a</text>
  <text start="474.479" dur="5.34">transition now while Trump is doing all</text>
  <text start="478.59" dur="2.52">this and I&amp;#39;m just not just saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.819" dur="5.551">Trump there&amp;#39;s many people working on</text>
  <text start="481.11" dur="8.13">this light hyzer Ross many others while</text>
  <text start="485.37" dur="6.78">he&amp;#39;s doing this he&amp;#39;s also setting up the</text>
  <text start="489.24" dur="5.609">central bank system and it seems like</text>
  <text start="492.15" dur="5.28">the central banks they are taking the</text>
  <text start="494.849" dur="6.481">bait now we know that the IMF said</text>
  <text start="497.43" dur="6.87">listen the world growth it is declining</text>
  <text start="501.33" dur="6.209">because of the us-china trade war it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.3" dur="6.54">going to jeopardize the 2019 the 2020</text>
  <text start="507.539" dur="5.461">global growth now Christine Lagarde came</text>
  <text start="510.84" dur="3.569">out and said this and we know it really</text>
  <text start="513" dur="4.89">has something to do with the trade talks</text>
  <text start="514.409" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re using this to explain why the</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="4.35">global growth is declining now it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="519.839" dur="4.471">declining for a very long time it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="522.24" dur="4.71">like it just started we tracked this</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="5.31">before we&amp;#39;re still tracking it and every</text>
  <text start="526.95" dur="5.31">time Christine Lagarde but the IMF that</text>
  <text start="529.62" dur="4.409">they came out and they said listen this</text>
  <text start="532.26" dur="4.769">year we&amp;#39;re gonna see a 3% GDP this year</text>
  <text start="534.029" dur="5.791">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a 3.2 percent GDP well</text>
  <text start="537.029" dur="5.491">since 2008 they&amp;#39;ve never hit any of</text>
  <text start="539.82" dur="4.23">these predictions actually they were</text>
  <text start="542.52" dur="7.379">much much lower and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="10.56">declining and the trajectory is down not</text>
  <text start="549.899" dur="7.531">up and this was way before any tariffs</text>
  <text start="554.61" dur="6.18">or trade negotiations or anything like</text>
  <text start="557.43" dur="4.97">that so we have the IMF who&amp;#39;s saying the</text>
  <text start="560.79" dur="4.4">tariffs and the</text>
  <text start="562.4" dur="5.7">that is the problem and then we turned</text>
  <text start="565.19" dur="6.089">towards the Federal Reserve the Federal</text>
  <text start="568.1" dur="8.16">Reserve for Federal Reserve policymakers</text>
  <text start="571.279" dur="7.771">they were sitting together and they were</text>
  <text start="576.26" dur="6">saying that what Trump is doing right</text>
  <text start="579.05" dur="7.65">now with China these trade tensions it</text>
  <text start="582.26" dur="9.09">could threaten the growth in 2019 and</text>
  <text start="586.7" dur="5.07">2020 and coming from Dallas Fed Robert</text>
  <text start="591.35" dur="2.4">Kaplan</text>
  <text start="591.77" dur="3.66">he said I&amp;#39;m watching very carefully how</text>
  <text start="593.75" dur="4.23">these trade tensions unfold because I</text>
  <text start="595.43" dur="5.07">have a concern whether that could cause</text>
  <text start="597.98" dur="6.99">some declaration in the rate of growth</text>
  <text start="600.5" dur="9.51">and they&amp;#39;re watching this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.97" dur="6.9">already using this to explain why the</text>
  <text start="610.01" dur="4.25">growth around the world in the United</text>
  <text start="611.87" dur="5.58">States is going to slow</text>
  <text start="614.26" dur="4.84">now remember Trump continually says he</text>
  <text start="617.45" dur="4.71">is not in a rush</text>
  <text start="619.1" dur="5.82">to make a deal with China I wonder why</text>
  <text start="622.16" dur="4.98">he&amp;#39;s not in a rush I think he wants this</text>
  <text start="624.92" dur="7.23">to play out a little bit longer he wants</text>
  <text start="627.14" dur="9.199">the IMF and the Fed to commit to the</text>
  <text start="632.15" dur="8.85">problem the problem is the trade war is</text>
  <text start="636.339" dur="8.771">the tariffs that is why the entire</text>
  <text start="641" dur="6">system is breaking down and then what</text>
  <text start="645.11" dur="4.56">he&amp;#39;s going to do and I believe before</text>
  <text start="647" dur="6.3">this year is out I think Trump will have</text>
  <text start="649.67" dur="6.71">a deal with China one way or another the</text>
  <text start="653.3" dur="5.43">tariffs are going to be removed and</text>
  <text start="656.38" dur="7.2">there&amp;#39;s going to be no more trade war</text>
  <text start="658.73" dur="6.83">and Trump is going to turn on the Fed</text>
  <text start="663.58" dur="5.44">saying you were wrong</text>
  <text start="665.56" dur="6.149">look everything&amp;#39;s worked out we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="669.02" dur="5.069">see slowing growth nothing happened and</text>
  <text start="671.709" dur="4.75">the United States is still strong but</text>
  <text start="674.089" dur="4.981">look at all the other countries look at</text>
  <text start="676.459" dur="7.741">Europe look at the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="679.07" dur="8.639">they&amp;#39;re still slowing why what can you</text>
  <text start="684.2" dur="5.759">do about it to fix it guess what they</text>
  <text start="687.709" dur="4.471">don&amp;#39;t have an answer they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="689.959" dur="5.431">what to do because it was never supposed</text>
  <text start="692.18" dur="5.82">to go on this long they were supposed to</text>
  <text start="695.39" dur="5.819">have their event they never thought she</text>
  <text start="698" dur="5.01">would lose and we were supposed to be in</text>
  <text start="701.209" dur="4.291">this major event right now which they</text>
  <text start="703.01" dur="5.25">could use to cover it up they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="705.5" dur="5.43">it right now Trump is going to turn the</text>
