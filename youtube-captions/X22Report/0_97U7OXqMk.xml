  <text start="88.95" dur="6.33">fraud and it&amp;#39;s just like the tulip bulbs</text>

  <text start="144.599" dur="6.481">seriously violating supervision laws so</text>
  <text start="148.11" dur="4.83">once again these individuals who call</text>
  <text start="151.08" dur="4.29">out and say things about Bitcoin or</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="5.99">anything else it always seems it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="6.449">really about them and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="158.93" dur="5.41">remember everything the government&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="161.819" dur="3.451">central bank&amp;#39;s these financial</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="2.22">institutions when they tell you</text>
  <text start="165.27" dur="3.09">something it&amp;#39;s always the opposite</text>
  <text start="166.56" dur="3.959">actually it always goes back to what</text>
  <text start="168.36" dur="5.489">they are really doing and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170.519" dur="5.341">want to be found out about it now we</text>
  <text start="173.849" dur="4.201">understand that the blockchain</text>
  <text start="175.86" dur="4.23">technology it&amp;#39;s new it&amp;#39;s up-and-coming</text>
  <text start="178.05" dur="5.55">just like the Internet the central</text>
  <text start="180.09" dur="5.37">bankers the banking community well they</text>
  <text start="183.6" dur="3.06">want to control it this is going to be</text>
  <text start="185.46" dur="2.08">very difficult to do but they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="186.66" dur="3.01">to try to do it</text>
  <text start="187.54" dur="3.39">if they can&amp;#39;t control it there&amp;#39;s no need</text>
  <text start="189.67" dur="3.06">for the central bank there&amp;#39;s no need for</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="3.72">the banking system system can run</text>
  <text start="192.73" dur="3.479">independent of all of this it&amp;#39;s running</text>
  <text start="194.65" dur="5.25">independent of all of it right now and</text>
  <text start="196.209" dur="6.541">as more and more companies retailers</text>
  <text start="199.9" dur="4.77">start using the blockchain technology</text>
  <text start="202.75" dur="4.2">and start paying people in</text>
  <text start="204.67" dur="6.03">cryptocurrencies and more retailers</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="5.58">accept crypto currencies we are going to</text>
  <text start="210.7" dur="3.119">bypass the banking system we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="212.53" dur="3.179">bypass the central banking system</text>
  <text start="213.819" dur="5.67">because right now the central banking</text>
  <text start="215.709" dur="6.75">system they issue the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="219.489" dur="3.771">Note this is what we use to purchase</text>
  <text start="222.459" dur="5.521">goods</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="7.869">well the crypto coins they don&amp;#39;t issue</text>
  <text start="227.98" dur="7.44">these they have nothing to do with them</text>
  <text start="231.129" dur="7.291">and if these are used for transactions</text>
  <text start="235.42" dur="5.429">like you&amp;#39;re paid in it and then you can</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="3.78">use it to purchase goods and you never</text>
  <text start="240.849" dur="4.53">have to go into the Federal Reserve Note</text>
  <text start="242.2" dur="5.819">we bypass them completely this is what</text>
  <text start="245.379" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re most afraid of and this is why</text>
  <text start="248.019" dur="4.291">they&amp;#39;re trying to take control because</text>
  <text start="249.819" dur="6.271">they know that they need to control all</text>
  <text start="252.31" dur="7.169">of it not just what they&amp;#39;re doing they</text>
  <text start="256.09" dur="7.049">can&amp;#39;t let any other currency pop up</text>
  <text start="259.479" dur="6.721">where they don&amp;#39;t have control here in</text>
  <text start="263.139" dur="5.701">the United States we understand that the</text>
  <text start="266.2" dur="7.26">brick-and-mortar stores they are failing</text>
  <text start="268.84" dur="6.18">and failing hard we see right now that</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="4.139">there&amp;#39;s a lot of retailers that have</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="4.5">declared bankruptcy and a lot more</text>
  <text start="277.599" dur="3.661">retailers are closing down and of course</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="3.45">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="281.26" dur="3.42">saying it&amp;#39;s the Amazon effect and</text>
  <text start="282.97" dur="5.759">they&amp;#39;re telling us that ecommerce</text>
  <text start="284.68" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re the ecommerce online shops</text>
  <text start="288.729" dur="4.471">they&amp;#39;re taking away from the</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="3.869">brick-and-mortar stores but we need to</text>
  <text start="293.2" dur="5.88">understand understand something very</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="6.891">important that only about 10 percent</text>
  <text start="299.08" dur="5.79">actually nine point one percent is</text>
  <text start="301.56" dur="5.8">ecommerce right now and a year ago is a</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="5.22">8.2 percent and yes it&amp;#39;s growing and it</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="6.15">will continue to grow but we&amp;#39;re not at</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="6.6">that point where ecommerce has taken</text>
  <text start="313.51" dur="5.51">over the brick-and-mortar stores think</text>
  <text start="316.69" dur="4.68">about this for a second there are still</text>
  <text start="319.02" dur="4.26">several large brick-and-mortar sector</text>
  <text start="321.37" dur="5.19">that are still considered online proof</text>
  <text start="323.28" dur="5.5">or e-commerce resistant whatever you</text>
  <text start="326.56" dur="6.359">want to call it and if you look at it</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="7.47">you can see this is the certain areas</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="6.72">like new and used vehicle dealers auto</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="5.97">parts retailers that&amp;#39;s 20% of total</text>
  <text start="339.639" dur="4.411">retail grocery and beverage stores</text>
  <text start="342.22" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s twelve point six percent of total</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="6.99">retail now we know that Amazon Costco</text>
  <text start="347.53" dur="5.58">Google online grocers they are trying to</text>
  <text start="351.04" dur="6.27">get into this market but it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="353.11" dur="6.17">tiny right now and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="357.31" dur="5.639">really isn&amp;#39;t having an effect on the</text>
  <text start="359.28" dur="5.02">online shopping so what really what</text>
  <text start="362.949" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re really looking at is you know</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="6.48">electronics clothing and other doodads</text>
  <text start="366.669" dur="6">that are sold over the Internet gasoline</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="4.68">stations they make up 8% of total retail</text>
  <text start="372.669" dur="5.521">sales restaurants and bars they make up</text>
  <text start="375.46" dur="4.679">12% of total retail sales remember new</text>
  <text start="378.19" dur="5.19">new and used vehicle dealers and auto</text>
  <text start="380.139" dur="4.801">parts they make up 21% and all this</text>
  <text start="383.38" dur="6.12">might change in the future but right now</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="7.37">as we can see they account for 54% of</text>
  <text start="389.5" dur="8.639">total retail sales so right now</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="8.62">ecommerce is not really the the main</text>
  <text start="398.139" dur="6.15">area that&amp;#39;s hurting brick-and-mortar now</text>
  <text start="400.93" dur="6.39">think about this for a second despite 16</text>
  <text start="404.289" dur="6.151">years of inflation population growth</text>
  <text start="407.32" dur="8.01">growth since then department store sales</text>
  <text start="410.44" dur="7.92">have plunged by 35 percent and the</text>
  <text start="415.33" dur="5.28">population is growing the unemployment</text>
  <text start="418.36" dur="5.76">has come down a four point one percent</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="5.79">and retail stores they&amp;#39;re hurting</text>
  <text start="424.12" dur="5.579">they&amp;#39;re closing and we don&amp;#39;t see that</text>
  <text start="426.4" dur="6.57">1:1 ratio going to online so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="429.699" dur="6.931">not happening now Wall Street they are</text>
  <text start="432.97" dur="6.449">realizing there is a problem in the</text>
  <text start="436.63" dur="4.11">brick-and-mortar retail industry they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="439.419" dur="5.131">calling it a brick-and-mortar meltdown</text>
  <text start="440.74" dur="4.41">and what they have done and this is very</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="4.53">interesting</text>
  <text start="445.15" dur="7.65">they created an ETF and it focuses on</text>
  <text start="449.08" dur="5.55">the first the retailer&amp;#39;s the ticker is</text>
  <text start="452.8" dur="2.609">named emty</text>
  <text start="454.63" dur="4.95">and</text>
  <text start="455.409" dur="7.61">this etf does well it is specifically</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="8.519">designed to benefit from the decline of</text>
  <text start="463.019" dur="9.07">bricks and mortar retailers now as we</text>
  <text start="468.099" dur="7.92">can see they have an index of department</text>
  <text start="472.089" dur="5.73">stores supermarkets retailers of apparel</text>
  <text start="476.019" dur="5.19">consumer electronics home improvements</text>
  <text start="477.819" dur="6.87">and they&amp;#39;re watching these specific</text>
  <text start="481.209" dur="6.42">stores Rite Aid JCPenney Office Depot</text>
  <text start="484.689" dur="5.611">Sears smart and final stores expressed</text>
  <text start="487.629" dur="4.981">GNC holding barns and normal Chico&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="490.3" dur="6.089">many more now if we look right aid is</text>

  <text start="496.389" dur="6.54">down 47% Sears down 67% and it goes on</text>
  <text start="500.319" dur="4.62">and on and on so they know what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="502.929" dur="5.67">on here they know it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="504.939" dur="5.91">disaster and it&amp;#39;s getting worse I mean</text>
  <text start="508.599" dur="4.74">if we look in Manhattan right now we can</text>
  <text start="510.849" dur="5.521">see that retailers are being priced out</text>
  <text start="513.339" dur="5.1">of business because rents right now they</text>
  <text start="516.37" dur="4.919">are skyrocketing and this is because of</text>
  <text start="518.439" dur="6.241">all the bubbles that were created and if</text>
  <text start="521.289" dur="6.211">you look at the map of Manhattan Midtown</text>
  <text start="524.68" dur="7.23">and upper and lower Manhattan you can</text>
  <text start="527.5" dur="8.069">see that there are empty retail</text>
  <text start="531.91" dur="6.21">storefronts everywhere and it&amp;#39;s growing</text>
  <text start="535.569" dur="5.221">and it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse and</text>
  <text start="538.12" dur="5.579">worse and it&amp;#39;s going to get a lot worse</text>
  <text start="540.79" dur="6.419">after this holiday season we see that</text>
  <text start="543.699" dur="5.851">the Texas bullion depository took a step</text>
  <text start="547.209" dur="4.5">closer becoming an opera becoming</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="3.959">operational earlier this month when</text>
  <text start="551.709" dur="5.57">officials announced location of their</text>
  <text start="553.509" dur="6.121">new facility remember the state of Texas</text>
  <text start="557.279" dur="5.17">they created the state bullion</text>
  <text start="559.63" dur="5.04">depository this is a shift away from the</text>
  <text start="562.449" dur="3.901">federal government to the state and it</text>
  <text start="564.67" dur="3.18">provides a blueprint that could</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="4.349">ultimately end the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="567.85" dur="5.549">monopoly on money now governor Greg</text>
  <text start="570.699" dur="4.801">Abbott signed legislation creating the</text>
  <text start="573.399" dur="5.79">state gold bullion and precious metal</text>
  <text start="575.5" dur="5.61">depository in June of 2015 the facility</text>
  <text start="579.189" dur="3.991">will not only provide a secure place for</text>
  <text start="581.11" dur="4.349">individuals businesses cities counties</text>
  <text start="583.18" dur="3.509">government agencies and the rest to</text>
  <text start="585.459" dur="3.721">store their gold and other precious</text>
  <text start="586.689" dur="6.061">metals the law also creates</text>
  <text start="589.18" dur="5.52">mechanism to facilitate the everyday use</text>
  <text start="592.75" dur="5.4">of gold and silver in business</text>
  <text start="594.7" dur="5.55">transaction in short a person will be</text>
  <text start="598.15" dur="3.99">able to deposit gold or silver in the</text>
  <text start="600.25" dur="4.59">depository and pay other people through</text>
  <text start="602.14" dur="5.55">electronic means or checks and again</text>
  <text start="604.84" dur="6.35">they&amp;#39;re getting away from the Federal</text>
  <text start="607.69" dur="6.63">Reserve Note so what we see here is that</text>
  <text start="611.19" dur="4.78">we have the crypto currency market where</text>
  <text start="614.32" dur="4.08">that is completely separate and apart</text>
  <text start="615.97" dur="5.25">from the Federal Reserve we see states</text>
  <text start="618.4" dur="5.52">now are taking on gold repositories and</text>
  <text start="621.22" dur="4.35">dealing electronically trading gold and</text>
  <text start="623.92" dur="3.78">other precious metals getting away from</text>
  <text start="625.57" dur="4.47">the Federal Reserve Note and everyone is</text>
  <text start="627.7" dur="5.07">protecting themselves because they</text>
  <text start="630.04" dur="5.4">understand the central banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632.77" dur="3.57">going to be in trouble the dollar is</text>
  <text start="635.44" dur="5.79">going to be in trouble</text>
  <text start="636.34" dur="6.27">and we know that everything that that is</text>
  <text start="641.23" dur="3.42">in this country that has to do with the</text>

  <text start="651.1" dur="5.73">the banks were colluding through text</text>
  <text start="654.01" dur="4.29">messages back and forth to fix the price</text>
  <text start="656.83" dur="3.54">of silver and gold</text>
