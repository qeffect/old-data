  <text start="87.6" dur="6.909">staying above the 1300 dollar mark and</text>
  <text start="91.05" dur="5.89">we realize that the people throughout</text>
  <text start="94.509" dur="7.92">Europe they&amp;#39;re starting to understand</text>
  <text start="96.94" dur="8.629">that the ECB the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="102.429" dur="6.33">can&amp;#39;t do anything to help the economy</text>
  <text start="105.569" dur="6.19">because if you really think about it the</text>
  <text start="108.759" dur="6.42">entire premise of the central bank is to</text>
  <text start="111.759" dur="5.161">maintain or inspire economic confidence</text>
  <text start="115.179" dur="3.42">now we know that&amp;#39;s not really what</text>
  <text start="116.92" dur="4.319">they&amp;#39;re there for they&amp;#39;re there to</text>
  <text start="118.599" dur="5.52">spread dead they&amp;#39;re there to take the</text>
  <text start="121.239" dur="4.651">natural resources of countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="124.119" dur="6.511">there to put people into debt and to</text>
  <text start="125.89" dur="7.14">control them but when they created the</text>
  <text start="130.63" dur="4.8">central bank and they intertwined with</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="5.37">the government&amp;#39;s they use the mantra</text>
  <text start="135.43" dur="6.029">that yes we&amp;#39;re here to help we&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="138.4" dur="5.809">to maintain economic confidence to</text>
  <text start="141.459" dur="5.491">control the economy so it doesn&amp;#39;t crash</text>
  <text start="144.209" dur="7.721">but we can see that it&amp;#39;s all smoke and</text>
  <text start="146.95" dur="8.66">mirrors and the people are not buying it</text>
  <text start="151.93" dur="6">anymore this morning&amp;#39;s zoo data on</text>
  <text start="155.61" dur="6.1">German and European consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="157.93" dur="5.56">it is a complete disaster both the</text>
  <text start="161.71" dur="6.52">current situation and Xbox</text>
  <text start="163.49" dur="9.3">for Germany tumbled but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.23" dur="10.5">seeing is hope european economic growth</text>
  <text start="172.79" dur="11.15">and hope has crashed to its lowest since</text>
  <text start="178.73" dur="9.21">2012 so everything mario draghi promised</text>
  <text start="183.94" dur="6.1">to do whatever it takes did not help it</text>
  <text start="187.94" dur="4.86">has failed the people are looking at</text>
  <text start="190.04" dur="6.12">this they don&amp;#39;t believe hope is gone</text>
  <text start="192.8" dur="7.83">their expectations for the economy doing</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="6.84">much much better well it&amp;#39;s gone then if</text>
  <text start="200.63" dur="5.52">we look here in the United States what</text>
  <text start="203" dur="5.93">do we see well if we&amp;#39;re going by the</text>
  <text start="206.15" dur="7.71">Gallup poll which is a poll taken by</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="7.51">Gallup among the people compared to what</text>
  <text start="213.86" dur="5.49">the government does we see two opposite</text>
  <text start="216.44" dur="7.29">things the Gallup poll right now is</text>
  <text start="219.35" dur="8.66">showing that people their confidence in</text>
  <text start="223.73" dur="7.62">the economy is declining rapidly and</text>
  <text start="228.01" dur="7">Americans confidence remains remains</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="9.36">very very very weak Gallup&amp;#39;s US economic</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="8.04">confidence index is at negative 17 now</text>
  <text start="240.71" dur="6.42">we came from negative 12 and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.05" dur="5.31">dropped to negative 17 and this reading</text>
  <text start="247.13" dur="3.12">is tied for the worst economic</text>
  <text start="248.36" dur="5.15">confidence rating recorded in the last</text>
  <text start="250.25" dur="6.72">few years and what does this suggest</text>
  <text start="253.51" dur="6.599">Americans right now believe that the</text>
  <text start="256.97" dur="5.91">economy is getting worse not better and</text>
  <text start="260.109" dur="6.881">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing and it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="262.88" dur="8.18">when we look at the gallop graph we see</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="7.62">back in January of 2015 where people saw</text>
  <text start="271.06" dur="6.19">the economy as doing well and that</text>
  <text start="274.61" dur="6.75">number was at a five it was above zero</text>
  <text start="277.25" dur="6.93">and then since january of 2015 it is</text>
  <text start="281.36" dur="5.28">slid if we move to march 2015 it slid to</text>
  <text start="284.18" dur="6.11">one then we went directly into the</text>
  <text start="286.64" dur="6.99">negative range ending up September 15th</text>
  <text start="290.29" dur="6.31">September of 2015 at negative 17 and</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="3.779">then we bounced around between negative</text>
  <text start="296.6" dur="3.959">15</text>
  <text start="297.409" dur="6.84">negative 9 negative 16 and here we are</text>
  <text start="300.559" dur="8.28">in July of 2016 and negative 17 so this</text>
  <text start="304.249" dur="6.18">is in a downward trend people are not</text>
  <text start="308.839" dur="2.88">looking at the economy thinking it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310.429" dur="3.871">going to get better actually the thing</text>
  <text start="311.719" dur="6.72">that&amp;#39;s going to get much much worse so</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="6.839">the US came out with their housing</text>
  <text start="318.439" dur="5.04">numbers today and they&amp;#39;re all saying</text>
  <text start="321.139" dur="6.42">that housing is getting better we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.479" dur="5.851">seeing a increase of starts but the</text>
  <text start="327.559" dur="6.08">thing they forgot to tell everyone is</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="7.309">they made a huge downward revision</text>
  <text start="333.639" dur="6.221">because month on month they have it as</text>
  <text start="336.639" dur="5.2">housing starts jumping at four housing</text>
  <text start="339.86" dur="5.129">starts starting at four point eight</text>
  <text start="341.839" dur="6.36">percent so it jumped the four point</text>
  <text start="344.989" dur="6.9">eight percent showing that yet look</text>
  <text start="348.199" dur="9">everything is awesome but when you step</text>
  <text start="351.889" dur="9.45">back year-over-year starts dropped by</text>
  <text start="357.199" dur="10.22">0.2% the second annual drop in three</text>
  <text start="361.339" dur="9.54">months the growth in housing is slowing</text>
  <text start="367.419" dur="5.41">so they revised the numbers they show a</text>
  <text start="370.879" dur="3.99">little snapshot of what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="372.829" dur="5.721">they tell you that the housing market is</text>
  <text start="374.869" dur="7.53">recovering but when we look at this and</text>
  <text start="378.55" dur="8.349">we look at it very closely what do we</text>
  <text start="382.399" dur="11.16">really see well housing starts their</text>
  <text start="386.899" dur="10.58">back to January of 1991 levels the</text>
  <text start="393.559" dur="3.92">housing market has not improved</text>
  <text start="398.139" dur="4.63">nothing&amp;#39;s been the same since the</text>
  <text start="400.129" dur="6.66">housing bubble they haven&amp;#39;t improved</text>
  <text start="402.769" dur="8.48">anything I mean look at the labor</text>
  <text start="406.789" dur="10.8">participation rate its all-time lows</text>
  <text start="411.249" dur="12.551">look at retail contracting housing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417.589" dur="10.14">back to 1990 levels home ownership we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="423.8" dur="6.509">back to the 70s so when they talk about</text>
  <text start="427.729" dur="3.451">how things are surging they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="430.309" dur="4.531">at a very</text>
  <text start="431.18" dur="6.63">little tiny window here just in this</text>
  <text start="434.84" dur="4.98">month where they revised it but when you</text>
  <text start="437.81" dur="4.35">step back and you look at it and say</text>
  <text start="439.82" dur="6.84">okay well housing is at the same level</text>
  <text start="442.16" dur="8.61">as 1991 the starts how is this an</text>
  <text start="446.66" dur="12.259">improvement well it isn&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;re nowhere</text>
  <text start="450.77" dur="13.079">near where we were back in 99 in 2000</text>
  <text start="458.919" dur="9.671">2004-2005 going into 2008 nothing has</text>
  <text start="463.849" dur="6.451">changed except of course the US making</text>
  <text start="468.59" dur="3.859">it the US government making it look like</text>
  <text start="470.3" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s much better than it really is and</text>
  <text start="472.449" dur="5.111">you have to realize that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="475.49" dur="5.64">population it is grown by thirty-seven</text>
  <text start="477.56" dur="6.479">point two five percent since 1990 while</text>
  <text start="481.13" dur="7.17">one unit housing starts are the same are</text>
  <text start="484.039" dur="6.481">at the same level so we can see right</text>
  <text start="488.3" dur="5.48">now that really nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="490.52" dur="5.79">actually it&amp;#39;s gotten a lot lot worse and</text>
  <text start="493.78" dur="5.009">when we look at the housing market we</text>
  <text start="496.31" dur="7.65">see things are rapidly falling apart if</text>
  <text start="498.789" dur="8.491">we go to the Hamptons for instance very</text>
  <text start="503.96" dur="6.54">wealthy area the housing prices are</text>
  <text start="507.28" dur="6.58">astronomical but we see right now that</text>
  <text start="510.5" dur="7.08">overall sales they have plunged by half</text>
  <text start="513.86" dur="7.349">and home prices have fallen sharply in</text>
  <text start="517.58" dur="5.879">the second quarter total sales volume in</text>
  <text start="521.209" dur="4.351">the East Hampton fell by fifty three</text>
  <text start="523.459" dur="5.041">percent from a year ago to forty four</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="5.969">point seven million as the median sales</text>
  <text start="528.5" dur="5.76">price fell fifty-four percent to two</text>
  <text start="531.529" dur="5.611">point three eight million yes it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="534.26" dur="6.72">up there but what it shows us is things</text>
  <text start="537.14" dur="6.83">are rapidly coming down in Southampton</text>
  <text start="540.98" dur="6.83">total sales fell by forty-eight percent</text>
  <text start="543.97" dur="7.15">prices are falling by twenty one percent</text>
  <text start="547.81" dur="7.57">this shows us something it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="551.12" dur="7.35">spread and it will continue to spread to</text>
  <text start="555.38" dur="4.579">many different towns and cities and the</text>
  <text start="558.47" dur="3.9">same things happening out in London</text>
  <text start="559.959" dur="4.721">where there are home sellers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.37" dur="4.74">looking for buyers and guess what</text>
  <text start="564.68" dur="4.44">can&amp;#39;t find any they&amp;#39;re slashing their</text>
  <text start="567.11" dur="6.419">asking prices just to get rid of their</text>
  <text start="569.12" dur="5.67">properties since the brexit vote and</text>
  <text start="573.529" dur="3.181">this has nothing to do with the Braxtons</text>
  <text start="574.79" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;ll explain it in a little bit they</text>
  <text start="576.71" dur="4.11">have cut the asking prices by a hundred</text>
  <text start="579.38" dur="4.17">and sixty-three percent sales have</text>
  <text start="580.82" dur="5.66">plunged by eighteen percent and the</text>
  <text start="583.55" dur="6.69">brexit wasn&amp;#39;t the cause of all of this</text>
  <text start="586.48" dur="6.13">because back in December 2015 we saw</text>
  <text start="590.24" dur="5.19">that luxury housing in London was</text>
  <text start="592.61" dur="4.68">already declining this is based on the</text>
  <text start="595.43" dur="5.849">lawn res report for the third quarter</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="6.739">and we can see right now is that people</text>
  <text start="601.279" dur="6.331">just don&amp;#39;t have the funds to purchase</text>
  <text start="604.029" dur="5.321">the traffic is drawing up and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="607.61" dur="5.28">seeing this in many different areas and</text>
  <text start="609.35" dur="6.06">these bubbles are starting to pop now</text>
  <text start="612.89" dur="5.73">the Baltic Dry Index it is shot up in</text>
  <text start="615.41" dur="6.989">the last couple of weeks at 746 it is</text>
  <text start="618.62" dur="7.68">down two points and this magically shut</text>
  <text start="622.399" dur="6.031">up right after the brexit but we can see</text>
  <text start="626.3" dur="4.38">right now it&amp;#39;s leveling off and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="628.43" dur="5.07">starting to fall again still well below</text>
  <text start="630.68" dur="4.89">where we should be and we&amp;#39;ll watch that</text>
  <text start="633.5" dur="4.8">very closely some people are saying that</text>
  <text start="635.57" dur="4.11">this number is now manipulated but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="638.3" dur="6.33">have to watch it and see where this</text>
  <text start="639.68" dur="7.29">heads now the IMF is out there and they</text>
  <text start="644.63" dur="5.25">are blaming what is going on in the</text>
  <text start="646.97" dur="5.34">global economy on the brexit so we can</text>
  <text start="649.88" dur="4.8">see this has begun they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="652.31" dur="4.83">saying that because the people voted</text>
  <text start="654.68" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s because of the brexit this is why</text>
  <text start="657.14" dur="5.28">the economy&amp;#39;s slowing this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="660.89" dur="3.87">seeing a decline in many different areas</text>
  <text start="662.42" dur="4.859">this is why we&amp;#39;re revising our outlook</text>
  <text start="664.76" dur="4.65">and this is exactly what the IMF has</text>
  <text start="667.279" dur="5.671">done they revised their global outlook</text>
  <text start="669.41" dur="6.24">for 2016 and they dropped two to three</text>
  <text start="672.95" dur="5.73">point one percent and they&amp;#39;ve dropped 20</text>
  <text start="675.65" dur="4.74">17 to three point four percent which we</text>
  <text start="678.68" dur="5.969">know these numbers are still way too</text>
  <text start="680.39" dur="6.93">high IMF normally over predicts</text>
  <text start="684.649" dur="6.091">everything and you can / these numbers</text>
  <text start="687.32" dur="6.69">in half because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="690.74" dur="5.07">that as the global economy slows and</text>
  <text start="694.01" dur="3.6">declines which has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="695.81" dur="2.65">the brexit it&amp;#39;s been happening a very</text>
  <text start="697.61" dur="2.92">long time we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="698.46" dur="4.14">tracking this looking at this we can see</text>
  <text start="700.53" dur="4.98">right now that this is going to continue</text>
  <text start="702.6" dur="6.18">but they need a scapegoat they need to</text>
  <text start="705.51" dur="5.13">blame others for what is happening right</text>
  <text start="708.78" dur="4.44">now and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="710.64" dur="6">starting to do most likely they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="713.22" dur="5.79">starting to blame turkey saying that up</text>
  <text start="716.64" dur="3.9">because of this coup we also have other</text>
  <text start="719.01" dur="3.93">financial problems and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="720.54" dur="5.25">spread so they&amp;#39;re using whatever they</text>
  <text start="722.94" dur="5.46">possibly can to blame everything on</text>
  <text start="725.79" dur="4.44">another group another country a vote or</text>
  <text start="728.4" dur="4.71">whatever they possibly can because they</text>
  <text start="730.23" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t want to be responsible for what is</text>
  <text start="733.11" dur="4.77">about to happen and that is a major</text>
  <text start="734.88" dur="5.42">collapse of the system and this is why</text>
  <text start="737.88" dur="5.73">everyone has to be prepared and ready I</text>
  <text start="740.3" dur="5.83">mean look at Venezuela they have a</text>
  <text start="743.61" dur="5.04">difficult time purchasing food there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="746.13" dur="5.64">no supplies it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="748.65" dur="5.04">harder for the people and we can see</text>

  <text start="790.11" dur="5.07">becoming more and more chaotic we can</text>
  <text start="792.96" dur="4.83">see they&amp;#39;re pushing more false flags we</text>
  <text start="795.18" dur="4.98">can see they&amp;#39;re trying to have people</text>
  <text start="797.79" dur="4.68">fight with each other to distract them</text>
  <text start="800.16" dur="5.43">from what is really happening we can see</text>
  <text start="802.47" dur="5.34">war is being provoked we can see many</text>
  <text start="805.59" dur="5.22">things are kering at once and this is</text>
  <text start="807.81" dur="7.34">all being done on purpose to distract</text>
  <text start="810.81" dur="8.84">from this entire collapse of the system</text>
  <text start="815.15" dur="7.57">now Obama is out there and he is pushing</text>
  <text start="819.65" dur="5.17">his Obamacare to point out and we</text>
  <text start="822.72" dur="6.09">discussed this a little bit in reports</text>
  <text start="824.82" dur="7.32">previous to this so Obama wants to fix</text>
  <text start="828.81" dur="6.93">his unconstitutional Obamacare</text>
  <text start="832.14" dur="7.38">with an unconstitutional fix now the</text>
  <text start="835.74" dur="8.73">Affordable Care Act as we know is not</text>
  <text start="839.52" dur="7.2">working it is a failed plan because one</text>
  <text start="844.47" dur="4.83">of the promises was by setting up these</text>
  <text start="846.72" dur="4.98">coops insurance was going to be very</text>
  <text start="849.3" dur="5.04">cheap and it was going to be affordable</text>
  <text start="851.7" dur="5.19">so everyone get their hands on it I</text>
  <text start="854.34" dur="6.99">guess what that didn&amp;#39;t happen premiums</text>
  <text start="856.89" dur="6.72">skyrocketed coops to faulted closed and</text>
  <text start="861.33" dur="7.4">the whole things falling apart now some</text>
  <text start="863.61" dur="7.47">are saying this was planned so Obama</text>
  <text start="868.73" dur="6.45">would be able to introduce a</text>
  <text start="871.08" dur="6.42">single-payer government-run system and</text>
  <text start="875.18" dur="4.36">we can see this is where he is headed</text>
  <text start="877.5" dur="4.17">now do you really think the government</text>
  <text start="879.54" dur="7.86">can run anything better because as we</text>
  <text start="881.67" dur="9.57">know once the government takes over all</text>
  <text start="887.4" dur="9.11">of a sudden these things grow more money</text>
  <text start="891.24" dur="8.27">is spent things are not run properly</text>
  <text start="896.51" dur="8.05">they have to borrow more from the Fed</text>
  <text start="899.51" dur="9.76">taxpayers are taxed more for it and it</text>
  <text start="904.56" dur="5.94">ends in a failure and we can see this</text>
  <text start="909.27" dur="4.56">has been happening throughout the</text>
  <text start="910.5" dur="5.13">government and once these programs take</text>
  <text start="913.83" dur="7.91">root they just don&amp;#39;t go away they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="915.63" dur="11.13">shrink and this is exactly what Obama</text>
  <text start="921.74" dur="8.77">wants he wants everyone connected to the</text>
  <text start="926.76" dur="8.43">government in some way where the</text>
  <text start="930.51" dur="7.38">government is supporting them they want</text>
  <text start="935.19" dur="5.63">the people to be dependent on the</text>
  <text start="937.89" dur="8.34">government instead of the people being</text>
  <text start="940.82" dur="6.88">independent this is their plan listen</text>
