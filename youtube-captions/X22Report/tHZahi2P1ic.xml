  <text start="334.219" dur="5.51">entire agenda not just him all the</text>
  <text start="336.74" dur="6.179">Patriots behind him is to push this</text>
  <text start="339.729" dur="5.261">forward to get past the 2020 elections</text>

  <text start="352.88" dur="4.8">economy doesn&amp;#39;t crash remember go back</text>
  <text start="355.099" dur="4.921">in time what was the plan of the central</text>
  <text start="357.68" dur="5.13">bank in the deep state they were going</text>
  <text start="360.02" dur="6.959">to crash this system by raising interest</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="7.979">rates they were going to do this through</text>
  <text start="366.979" dur="8.011">2019 q told us the Patriots are in</text>
  <text start="370.789" dur="6.421">control the central bank will no longer</text>
  <text start="374.99" dur="6">raise rates what did the central bank do</text>
  <text start="377.21" dur="5.85">they reverse course they said okay we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="3.03">not going to raise rates anymore we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="383.06" dur="3.06">gonna hold them steady</text>
  <text start="384.02" dur="6.449">then Trump wanted them to cut rates and</text>
  <text start="386.12" dur="7.26">they actually did remember the Fed was</text>
  <text start="390.469" dur="4.561">tightening they were unloading</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="4.23">everything on their balance sheet as</text>
  <text start="395.03" dur="4.859">quickly as they possibly could without</text>
  <text start="397.61" dur="3.779">destroying the economy because then it</text>
  <text start="399.889" dur="4.34">would be obvious that they are the ones</text>
  <text start="401.389" dur="5.311">who destroyed it they reverse that</text>
  <text start="404.229" dur="6.011">instead of tightening they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="406.7" dur="5.939">start stimulus now we need to remember</text>
  <text start="410.24" dur="6.72">something very important we need to</text>
  <text start="412.639" dur="9.241">remember what the Fed is and what power</text>
  <text start="416.96" dur="6.889">it has the Fed is able to speed up or</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="4.649">slow down the economy via its</text>
  <text start="423.849" dur="5.251">manipulation of interest rates and the</text>
  <text start="426.529" dur="5.141">money supply now remember</text>
  <text start="429.1" dur="5.94">that the Federal Reserve lacks any</text>
  <text start="431.67" dur="6.85">direct accountability to the people of</text>
  <text start="435.04" dur="6.12">the United States it is only by a</text>
  <text start="438.52" dur="5.76">president appointing and the Senate</text>
  <text start="441.16" dur="6.6">confirming members of its board that any</text>
  <text start="444.28" dur="7.44">public accountability operates once in</text>
  <text start="447.76" dur="8.31">office they are autonomous remember the</text>
  <text start="451.72" dur="9.51">Federal Reserve sits on land not owned</text>
  <text start="456.07" dur="7.43">or controlled by US laws the Federal</text>
  <text start="461.23" dur="5.46">Reserve they don&amp;#39;t even pay taxes</text>
  <text start="463.5" dur="5.95">because taxes weren&amp;#39;t for them the taxes</text>
  <text start="466.69" dur="5.3">were to enslave the people think about</text>
  <text start="469.45" dur="4.77">this we have this private corporation</text>
  <text start="471.99" dur="4.63">running the economy which really means</text>
  <text start="474.22" dur="5.96">creating currency loaning it to the</text>

  <text start="488.26" dur="5.16">inner workings when what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="490.12" dur="8.84">they&amp;#39;re not transparent at all why do</text>
  <text start="493.42" dur="10.26">you think that was the time has come and</text>
  <text start="498.96" dur="8.02">the time is here the world is starting</text>
  <text start="503.68" dur="5.76">to speak up people around the globe are</text>
  <text start="506.98" dur="5.73">starting to realize that it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="509.44" dur="5.789">central bank and as Trump continues on</text>
  <text start="512.71" dur="4.709">and continually accelerates the attacks</text>
  <text start="515.229" dur="4.651">on the central bank because he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="517.419" dur="5.461">going to give up when the central bank</text>
  <text start="519.88" dur="6.99">lowers the interest rate when they start</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="6.54">stimulus he&amp;#39;s gonna want more he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="526.87" dur="5.07">continue with the attacks he has to he</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="6.21">has to build the narrative until after</text>
  <text start="531.94" dur="7.35">the election because once he stays in</text>
  <text start="535.63" dur="6.48">the White House well the gloves come off</text>
  <text start="539.29" dur="6.51">he will be able to do whatever he needs</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="5.63">to do to get rid of the central bank why</text>
  <text start="545.8" dur="4.77">do you think he wants Judy Shelton on</text>
  <text start="547.74" dur="4.93">the Federal Reserve Board why do you</text>
  <text start="550.57" dur="5.26">think he&amp;#39;s choosing individuals that</text>

  <text start="555.83" dur="6.53">that like sound money that really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="558.709" dur="7.111">believe in the federal reserve system</text>
  <text start="562.36" dur="7.09">because the time has come the time has</text>
  <text start="565.82" dur="6.86">come to transition us and to expose the</text>
  <text start="569.45" dur="5.49">central bank to the entire world and</text>
  <text start="572.68" dur="5.2">this is going to happen in many</text>

  <text start="607.519" dur="4.291">swamp is nothing compared to the central</text>
  <text start="609.92" dur="6.81">bank remember the power of the central</text>
  <text start="611.81" dur="7.89">bank they can wipe out countries they</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="5.43">put countries into debt on purpose to</text>
  <text start="619.7" dur="6.6">control them they have the ability to</text>
