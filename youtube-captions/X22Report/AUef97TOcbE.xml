  <text start="56.73" dur="6.81">report my name is Dave incepted 1381 a.n</text>
  <text start="60.54" dur="5.49">today&amp;#39;s date is September 18th 2017 and</text>
  <text start="63.54" dur="4.11">the top of the episode is the US pushes</text>
  <text start="66.03" dur="4.89">trade war with China threatening the</text>
  <text start="67.65" dur="5.67">world&amp;#39;s trading system let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="4.62">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="73.32" dur="3.659">we&amp;#39;ve been following the economy and all</text>
  <text start="75.54" dur="3.84">the different statistics that the</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="5.401">government the central bank the BLS and</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="4.95">the rest throw at us and you know they</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="4.95">manipulate these numbers we&amp;#39;ve delve</text>
  <text start="84.33" dur="5.399">into them we&amp;#39;ve basically uncovered what</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="4.5">is really going on here and where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="4.911">starting to see a clearer picture that</text>
  <text start="91.83" dur="5.7">they are continually manipulating or</text>
  <text start="94.64" dur="6.28">massaging these numbers to fit their</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="6.18">story when the real story is the economy</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="4.71">is falling apart now every month we know</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="3.6">that the government the BLS they put out</text>
  <text start="105.63" dur="5.099">this information and they tell us that</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="5.46">inflation is still running at 2% Janet</text>
  <text start="110.729" dur="3.961">Yellen comes out there saying this is</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="4.769">perfect we&amp;#39;re trying to get inflation up</text>
  <text start="114.69" dur="4.56">but it&amp;#39;s very very low and each time</text>
  <text start="117.539" dur="3.72">they come out they tell us what the</text>
  <text start="119.25" dur="3.869">inflation rate is I this week they are</text>
  <text start="121.259" dur="5.22">reporting that the year-over-year</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="6.42">inflation is around 1.9 percent now we</text>
  <text start="126.479" dur="4.651">know that this is a complete lie because</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="5.821">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="131.13" dur="7.079">manipulating the information and when we</text>
  <text start="135.36" dur="4.62">look at all the information and we look</text>
  <text start="138.209" dur="4.441">at what is really going on we can see</text>
  <text start="139.98" dur="4.44">that certain things certain areas of the</text>
  <text start="142.65" dur="4.26">economy are seeing inflation like the</text>
  <text start="144.42" dur="6.12">stock market I mean think about it from</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="5.37">1929 to 2007 levels we see the stock</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="4.77">market has increased from 70 percent to</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="5.7">129 percent and it&amp;#39;s even gone even</text>
  <text start="155.31" dur="5.46">higher than that today and that tells us</text>
  <text start="157.98" dur="5.07">that we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation were also</text>
  <text start="160.77" dur="4.2">seeing inflation and housing in college</text>
  <text start="163.05" dur="3.96">tuition we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation in</text>
  <text start="164.97" dur="3.81">automobiles we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation</text>
  <text start="167.01" dur="3.24">pretty much everywhere but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="4.23">telling us that there is no inflation</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="6.45">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="4.979">real median household income well they</text>
  <text start="176.7" dur="3.06">came out the corporate media was out</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="6.721">there saying it just surpassed the level</text>
  <text start="179.76" dur="5.88">achieved in 1999 think about that think</text>
  <text start="184.71" dur="1.77">about it for a second</text>
  <text start="185.64" dur="4.23">it</text>
  <text start="186.48" dur="6">took 17 years for the average American</text>
  <text start="189.87" dur="5.22">family to get back to a household income</text>
  <text start="192.48" dur="5.19">of fifty nine thousand the fifty nine</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="6.179">thousand dollars of household income in</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="7.05">2017 doesn&amp;#39;t quite go as far as it did</text>
  <text start="201.269" dur="6.03">in 1999 with even the BLS manipulated</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="4.799">inflation showing an 87 percent increase</text>
  <text start="207.299" dur="5.041">in medical costs an 80 percent increase</text>
  <text start="209.519" dur="5.101">in energy cost a 51 percent increase in</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="4.8">food cost a 53 percent increase in</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="4.679">housing costs and 115 percent increase</text>
  <text start="217.14" dur="4.739">in college education and of course the</text>
  <text start="219.299" dur="4.351">BLS changed their methodology boosting</text>
  <text start="221.879" dur="4.531">household income by seventeen hundred</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="6.809">and twenty thirteen so in reality it is</text>
  <text start="226.41" dur="6.449">still below the 1999 levels now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.459" dur="4.5">look at some examples here the average</text>
  <text start="232.859" dur="4.081">price of a new car in 2000 was</text>
  <text start="234.959" dur="4.081">twenty-two thousand today the average</text>
  <text start="236.94" dur="4.74">price is around thirty four thousand</text>
  <text start="239.04" dur="5.13">five hundred that&amp;#39;s a 57% increase the</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="5.07">BLS well they&amp;#39;re reporting that new</text>
  <text start="244.17" dur="6.06">vehicle inflation is whomping two</text>
  <text start="246.75" dur="6.66">percent since 2000 they have adjusted</text>
  <text start="250.23" dur="5.55">away fifty five percent of the actual</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="5.16">increase by saying airbags and other</text>
  <text start="255.78" dur="5.1">unnecessary technologies basically</text>
  <text start="258.57" dur="5.55">improved onal wheels to such an extent</text>
  <text start="260.88" dur="5.43">prices didn&amp;#39;t really go up and new</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="6.59">vehicles account for 3.6 percent of the</text>
  <text start="266.31" dur="7.229">CPI calculation another crazy example of</text>
  <text start="270.71" dur="5.53">underreporting inflation is the highest</text>
  <text start="273.539" dur="4.38">weighted category of housing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="4.29">supposed to reflect the cost of rent and</text>
  <text start="277.919" dur="5.551">home ownership the owners equivalent</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="5.52">rent calculation is purposely opaque in</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="6.48">order to suppress the true cost increase</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="5.97">now median home prices were a hundred</text>
  <text start="289.95" dur="4.08">and sixty five thousand in 2000 and</text>
  <text start="292.02" dur="3.74">currently three hundred and seventeen</text>
  <text start="294.03" dur="6.15">thousand today</text>
  <text start="295.76" dur="6.37">that&amp;#39;s a 92% increase the average rent</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="3.959">back in 2000 was four hundred and</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="4.17">seventy five and it has risen to nine</text>
  <text start="304.139" dur="4.831">hundred and ten dollars today that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="5.01">92% increase so it makes total sense for</text>
  <text start="308.97" dur="6.569">the BLS to report a fifty three percent</text>
  <text start="311.31" dur="6.24">increase in housing since 2000 I mean</text>
  <text start="315.539" dur="4.321">see what they&amp;#39;re doing here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="5.25">manipulating these numbers let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="319.86" dur="6.989">medical care medical care advancing by</text>
  <text start="322.8" dur="6.839">87% in 2000 sounds substantial but the</text>
  <text start="326.849" dur="7.44">only but that only equates to an annual</text>
  <text start="329.639" dur="7.53">inflation of 3.5% spend we know that</text>
  <text start="334.289" dur="4.981">this is much much higher just like</text>
  <text start="337.169" dur="4.111">everything else and if we look at the</text>
  <text start="339.27" dur="4.47">shadow stat numbers compared to what the</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="6.569">US is putting out there we can see that</text>
  <text start="343.74" dur="7.199">inflation is not 1.9 percent he&amp;#39;s having</text>
  <text start="347.849" dur="5.461">he&amp;#39;s calculating inflation around 6%</text>
  <text start="350.939" dur="3.931">right now so they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="353.31" dur="4.59">us and trying to convince the public</text>
  <text start="354.87" dur="5.49">that we&amp;#39;re not seeing any type infom of</text>
  <text start="357.9" dur="4.169">inflation and when we start to look at</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="4.739">all these different things we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="362.069" dur="4.771">inflation everywhere and remember when</text>
  <text start="365.099" dur="3.18">the entire petrodollar system starts to</text>
  <text start="366.84" dur="3.299">fall apart and these countries don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="368.279" dur="5.431">need to hold on to these dollars anymore</text>
  <text start="370.139" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;re going to see a devaluation of the</text>
  <text start="373.71" dur="3.15">currency and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="375.12" dur="3.9">inflation shoot up we&amp;#39;re gonna see it go</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="4.35">from 6 percent all the way up to who</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="3.869">knows what because it&amp;#39;s just going to</text>
  <text start="381.21" dur="2.639">get a lot better now of course what</text>
  <text start="382.889" dur="2.671">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to do is they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="383.849" dur="3.93">try to manipulate these numbers and make</text>
  <text start="385.56" dur="6.569">it seem like we&amp;#39;re not seeing inflation</text>
  <text start="387.779" dur="7.741">at all now we have a major pension storm</text>
  <text start="392.129" dur="4.47">headed our way and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="395.52" dur="2.54">pensions we discussed this before</text>
  <text start="396.599" dur="4.891">private in public</text>
  <text start="398.06" dur="6.219">most public pension plans are not fully</text>
  <text start="401.49" dur="5.76">funded right now and when we look at</text>
  <text start="404.279" dur="5.73">state and local pensions and we look at</text>
  <text start="407.25" dur="5.729">the unfunded liabilities they have</text>
  <text start="410.009" dur="5.791">roughly quintupled in the last decade</text>
  <text start="412.979" dur="6.75">not doubled not tripled not quadrupled</text>
  <text start="415.8" dur="5.91">but quintupled and that&amp;#39;s nice when</text>
  <text start="419.729" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;re you know I have an investment</text>
  <text start="421.71" dur="5.429">that&amp;#39;s nice when you have when you hit</text>
  <text start="424.259" dur="5.22">the lottery or you hit big in the slot</text>
  <text start="427.139" dur="5.52">machines but when it comes to pensions</text>
  <text start="429.479" dur="6.631">that&amp;#39;s not good because you owe money</text>
  <text start="432.659" dur="6.951">and when we look at the pensions we can</text>
  <text start="436.11" dur="7.47">see that they&amp;#39;ve taken on a lot of debt</text>
  <text start="439.61" dur="8.26">now according to a 2014 Pew study only</text>
  <text start="443.58" dur="6.239">15 states follow policies that have</text>
  <text start="447.87" dur="4.62">funded at least 100 percent of their</text>
  <text start="449.819" dur="4.031">pension needs and that estimate is based</text>
  <text start="452.49" dur="4.12">on the aggressive</text>
  <text start="453.85" dur="4.86">of pension funds that they will get</text>
  <text start="456.61" dur="4.26">their predicted rate of returns now a</text>
  <text start="458.71" dur="5.19">lot of them are based on six seven eight</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="5.58">percent type of returns but worse what</text>
  <text start="463.9" dur="6.87">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="466.45" dur="6.63">pension liabilities well they are out of</text>
  <text start="470.77" dur="5.01">this world and we can see there</text>
  <text start="473.08" dur="4.95">continually moving higher and higher US</text>
  <text start="475.78" dur="4.91">state and local pensions well they see</text>
  <text start="478.03" dur="5.25">their debts well - almost two trillion</text>
  <text start="480.69" dur="5.59">dollars right now we are in big trouble</text>
  <text start="483.28" dur="5.43">now here is the truth about pension</text>
  <text start="486.28" dur="5.16">liabilities let&amp;#39;s assume you have 1</text>
  <text start="488.71" dur="6">billion in funding today if you assume a</text>
  <text start="491.44" dur="6.06">7% compound return about the average for</text>
  <text start="494.71" dur="5.4">most pension funds then that means in 30</text>
  <text start="497.5" dur="5.85">years that 1 million will have grown to</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="5.34">8 billion dollars now what if it it is</text>
  <text start="503.35" dur="6.81">what what happens if you&amp;#39;re getting a 4%</text>
  <text start="505.45" dur="7.38">return using that rule guess what the 1</text>
  <text start="510.16" dur="5.25">billion grows to around 3.5 billion or</text>
  <text start="512.83" dur="5.28">less than half the future assets in 30</text>
  <text start="515.41" dur="5.43">years if you assume a 7% remember that</text>
  <text start="518.11" dur="6.15">every dollar that is not funded today</text>
  <text start="520.84" dur="6.69">means that somewhere between $4 and 8</text>
  <text start="524.26" dur="6.15">dollars will not be there in 30 years</text>
  <text start="527.53" dur="5.88">when somebody who is on a pension is</text>
  <text start="530.41" dur="5.19">expected to get it worse without proper</text>
  <text start="533.41" dur="5.22">funding as the phone starts going</text>
  <text start="535.6" dur="5.82">negative the funding ratio actually gets</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="5.01">worse sending it into a death spiral the</text>
  <text start="541.42" dur="6.09">only way to bring it out of the deaths</text>
  <text start="543.64" dur="6.27">pile is with huge cuts to other needed</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="3.96">services with like massive tax cuts to</text>
  <text start="549.91" dur="5.76">pension benefits or something like that</text>
  <text start="551.47" dur="6.36">now pension trustees they don&amp;#39;t face</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="4.92">personal liability they&amp;#39;re literally</text>
  <text start="557.83" dur="4.5">playing with other people&amp;#39;s money and</text>
  <text start="560.59" dur="4.23">they don&amp;#39;t really care what happens</text>
  <text start="562.33" dur="4.35">because that responsible for it and some</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="3.96">try very hard to be realistic and</text>
  <text start="566.68" dur="4.47">cautious others don&amp;#39;t but even the most</text>
  <text start="568.78" dur="4.35">diligent can&amp;#39;t control when the next</text>
  <text start="571.15" dur="3.87">recession comes they can&amp;#39;t control when</text>
  <text start="573.13" dur="5.58">the stock market crashes they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="575.02" dur="5.31">control anything but it gets worse many</text>
  <text start="578.71" dur="4.44">state and local governments have</text>
  <text start="580.33" dur="5.25">actually 100% funded their pension plans</text>
  <text start="583.15" dur="4.41">some states and local governments having</text>
  <text start="585.58" dur="3.54">even over funded them assume</text>
  <text start="587.56" dur="4.32">that they&amp;#39;re going to get their</text>
  <text start="589.12" dur="5.13">projected returns and what this really</text>
  <text start="591.88" dur="6.33">means is that the unfunded liabilities</text>
  <text start="594.25" dur="6.51">are more concentrated and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="598.21" dur="5.43">be a complete disaster so we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="600.76" dur="5.25">down this path where we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="603.64" dur="3.93">the pension systems both public and</text>
  <text start="606.01" dur="5.34">private they&amp;#39;re going to be in trouble</text>
  <text start="607.57" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation and the interest</text>
  <text start="611.35" dur="4.35">rates they&amp;#39;re not going anywhere they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="613.45" dur="5.46">not getting that projected rate of</text>
  <text start="615.7" dur="6.54">return this is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="618.91" dur="6.929">disaster now Jim Rogers is out there and</text>
  <text start="622.24" dur="6.18">we know that Steve minuchin and Trump</text>
  <text start="625.839" dur="6.181">and the rest of his administration</text>
  <text start="628.42" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re looking to go after China and of</text>
  <text start="632.02" dur="3.93">course this has to do with North Korea</text>
  <text start="633.73" dur="5.609">and they&amp;#39;re trying to place sanctions on</text>
  <text start="635.95" dur="5.73">China and North Korea and we could see</text>
  <text start="639.339" dur="3.361">right now if this does happen Jamar&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="641.68" dur="2.97">out there and we mentioned this before</text>
  <text start="642.7" dur="4.92">he&amp;#39;s saying this is going to hurt the</text>
  <text start="644.65" dur="6.84">United States the u.s. if they impose</text>
  <text start="647.62" dur="5.91">economic sanctions on China well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="651.49" dur="6.87">going to be a problem here in the United</text>
  <text start="653.53" dur="7.53">States so what&amp;#39;s going to happen it will</text>
  <text start="658.36" dur="6.479">bring the whole world economy down and</text>
  <text start="661.06" dur="5.73">in the end it will hurt America more</text>
  <text start="664.839" dur="3.241">than it hurts China because it just</text>
  <text start="666.79" dur="3.75">forces China and Russia and other</text>

  <text start="684.25" dur="5.19">world&amp;#39;s trading system and the United</text>
  <text start="687.7" dur="5.22">States is going to be in a lot of</text>
  <text start="689.44" dur="6.03">trouble now this is one way to crash an</text>
  <text start="692.92" dur="5.25">economy and it looks like we might be</text>
  <text start="695.47" dur="5.52">headed in this direction we see light</text>
  <text start="698.17" dur="5.039">hauser he&amp;#39;s saying that we need to have</text>
  <text start="700.99" dur="3.57">a change in trade policy because the</text>
  <text start="703.209" dur="2.851">trade policy that we have today</text>
  <text start="704.56" dur="5.88">and guess what it&amp;#39;s not gonna work</text>
  <text start="706.06" dur="7.05">anymore they know this light Houser says</text>
  <text start="710.44" dur="5.16">the US can compete if conditions are</text>

  <text start="715.6" dur="5.4">right now the dollar is dying trade is</text>

  <text start="723.16" dur="4.89">to change light Houser says he and Trent</text>
  <text start="726.37" dur="4.56">believe the US should be more proactive</text>
  <text start="728.05" dur="5.16">in trade policy everything that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="730.93" dur="5.22">put into place has to change right now</text>
  <text start="733.21" dur="5.55">we need to bring back manufacturing we</text>
  <text start="736.15" dur="4.65">need to join the new trading system we</text>
  <text start="738.76" dur="4.29">need to get rid of NAFTA we need to</text>
  <text start="740.8" dur="3.63">really look at what&amp;#39;s going on right now</text>
  <text start="743.05" dur="3.3">because everything is moving from the</text>
  <text start="744.43" dur="4.2">west to the east there&amp;#39;s nothing that</text>
  <text start="746.35" dur="5.1">can be done everything is in motion</text>
  <text start="748.63" dur="6.15">everything&amp;#39;s been duplicated and right</text>
  <text start="751.45" dur="4.8">now the system is deteriorating and</text>
  <text start="754.78" dur="3.87">falling apart very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="756.25" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s really nothing that they can do</text>
  <text start="758.65" dur="3.51">about this because they cannot bring all</text>
  <text start="760.69" dur="3.33">the manufacturing back to the United</text>
  <text start="762.16" dur="3.66">States before the economy collapses it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="764.02" dur="4.95">completely impossible because remember</text>
  <text start="765.82" dur="5.4">the Cabal they&amp;#39;ve been working at this</text>
  <text start="768.97" dur="4.98">for a very long time taking the</text>
  <text start="771.22" dur="4.59">manufacturing base taking our production</text>
  <text start="773.95" dur="4.32">taking everything here in the United</text>
  <text start="775.81" dur="3.8">States and moving it away from the</text>
  <text start="778.27" dur="4.53">United States because they understood</text>
  <text start="779.61" dur="5.02">that the dollar would no longer be the</text>
  <text start="782.8" dur="4.95">reserve currency of the world so if you</text>
  <text start="784.63" dur="4.56">look back in time since the 90s this is</text>
  <text start="787.75" dur="3.87">when this has all really started because</text>
  <text start="789.19" dur="3.6">they realized they only had a certain</text>
  <text start="791.62" dur="2.79">number of years and they knew how much</text>
  <text start="792.79" dur="3.86">time it was going to take and they</text>
  <text start="794.41" dur="4.89">realized they needed to do this type of</text>
  <text start="796.65" dur="6.42">maneuver because they were trying to</text>
  <text start="799.3" dur="6.3">make basically a global system where</text>
  <text start="803.07" dur="5.35">every country was going to be the same</text>
  <text start="805.6" dur="4.56">it didn&amp;#39;t matter where the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="808.42" dur="3.48">was because they were gonna eventually</text>
  <text start="810.16" dur="4.11">bring back third-world nation back to</text>
  <text start="811.9" dur="5.13">the United States and this was their</text>
  <text start="814.27" dur="6.12">plan now their plan is down the tubes</text>
  <text start="817.03" dur="6.93">and what do we have left here we have</text>
  <text start="820.39" dur="5.31">nothing and to bring everything back in</text>
  <text start="823.96" dur="4.379">this short period of time it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="825.7" dur="3.93">to work and this want this is why</text>
  <text start="828.339" dur="3.481">they&amp;#39;re putting a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="829.63" dur="4.62">China right now and it looks like to me</text>
  <text start="831.82" dur="4.98">that they&amp;#39;re ready to bring the system</text>
  <text start="834.25" dur="4.08">down there&amp;#39;s no way out of this the</text>
  <text start="836.8" dur="4.4">whole thing needs to be rebooted the</text>
  <text start="838.33" dur="5.759">whole thing needs to be brought down and</text>
  <text start="841.2" dur="5.23">by doing this and as we know we are a</text>
  <text start="844.089" dur="7.291">service country we&amp;#39;re consuming right</text>
  <text start="846.43" dur="7.29">now and how in the world if we play</text>
  <text start="851.38" dur="3.58">sections on China and we stop them from</text>
  <text start="853.72" dur="3.73">delivering products</text>
  <text start="854.96" dur="6.24">how does this help the United States it</text>
  <text start="857.45" dur="7.53">doesn&amp;#39;t it makes the situation worse it</text>
  <text start="861.2" dur="6.96">collapse it collapses the entire system</text>
  <text start="864.98" dur="5.7">actually it gets rid of the funding to</text>
  <text start="868.16" dur="6.15">the Cabal because when the system goes</text>
  <text start="870.68" dur="5.7">down guess what they&amp;#39;re screwed they</text>
  <text start="874.31" dur="4.95">can&amp;#39;t do anything right now so we can</text>
  <text start="876.38" dur="5.78">see that we might be looking at the</text>
  <text start="879.26" dur="6.06">first steps to bring down the entire</text>
  <text start="882.16" dur="5.5">system and it looks like we&amp;#39;re headed in</text>
  <text start="885.32" dur="4.65">this way and remember the central bank</text>
  <text start="887.66" dur="3.739">is also trying to bring down the system</text>
  <text start="889.97" dur="3.989">but they don&amp;#39;t wanna be blamed for this</text>
  <text start="891.399" dur="4.931">doing it this way it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="893.959" dur="6.091">setting it up so the central bank is</text>
  <text start="896.33" dur="7.02">actually to be blamed because the United</text>
  <text start="900.05" dur="6.15">States can&amp;#39;t survive without getting the</text>
  <text start="903.35" dur="4.29">products in from China by stocking the</text>
  <text start="906.2" dur="5.46">shelves by people going out and</text>
  <text start="907.64" dur="6.87">purchasing because once that is halted</text>
  <text start="911.66" dur="6.33">and we try to manufacture we try to</text>
  <text start="914.51" dur="6.09">export the entire country cannot be</text>
  <text start="917.99" dur="4.41">sustained on this not at this point so</text>
  <text start="920.6" dur="4.41">this looks like this is the first step</text>
  <text start="922.4" dur="4.5">to bring down the system and it looks</text>
  <text start="925.01" dur="3.81">like they&amp;#39;re pushing this agenda this is</text>
  <text start="926.9" dur="3.18">why you need to be ready and prepared</text>
