  <text start="47.339" dur="4.68">holiday season we realize the corporate</text>
  <text start="50.28" dur="2.91">media the US government the central</text>
  <text start="52.019" dur="2.671">bankers are going to continually push</text>
  <text start="53.19" dur="3.42">the idea that we&amp;#39;re in recovery that</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="3.389">sales are doing fantastic but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="56.61" dur="4.17">getting some information now about</text>
  <text start="58.079" dur="4.201">thanksgiving day and we understand that</text>
  <text start="60.78" dur="4.65">a lot of the stores were open during</text>
  <text start="62.28" dur="5.64">that time period but from analysts we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="5.369">starting to see that that day was not</text>
  <text start="67.92" dur="7.44">that great traffic at stores they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="7.621">declined during the thursday shopping</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="6.45">compared to last year and basically</text>
  <text start="78.42" dur="4.949">SunTrust Robinson Humphrey says we</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="6.15">believe thanksgiving shopping was a</text>
  <text start="83.369" dur="6.241">complete bust and they conducted channel</text>

  <text start="93.72" dur="6.42">throughout the night into black friday</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="6.84">and guess what traffic was either the</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="5.96">same or a lot less in many of the areas</text>
  <text start="103.08" dur="7.11">and it looked like a typical everyday</text>
  <text start="106.1" dur="6.46">saturday nothing really happened and</text>
  <text start="110.19" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re a little bit worried about this</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="3.48">because what they&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="114.03" dur="4.08">that people are not really coming out</text>
  <text start="116.04" dur="4.38">and going out to shop and spend their</text>
  <text start="118.11" dur="4.73">money now the mall of america is in</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="6.45">minneapolis the largest in the country</text>
  <text start="122.84" dur="7.539">edward rumah managing director he says</text>
  <text start="126.87" dur="7.07">he sees less traffic than years past as</text>
  <text start="130.379" dur="8.061">well he was there from 6 p.m. to 1am and</text>
  <text start="133.94" dur="6.879">8 am-2 this morning and guess what</text>
  <text start="138.44" dur="4.629">they&amp;#39;re seeing absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="140.819" dur="3.961">nothing like they wanted to save with</text>
  <text start="143.069" dur="4.741">the unemployment down at five point zero</text>
  <text start="144.78" dur="6.019">percent we were very close to full</text>
  <text start="147.81" dur="5.399">recovery they&amp;#39;re just not seeing what</text>
  <text start="150.799" dur="4.121">they thought they were going to say now</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="3.331">we understand today is black friday</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="3.599">we&amp;#39;re going to go into cyber monday and</text>
  <text start="156.54" dur="3.93">of course the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="158.519" dur="3.601">central bank US government is going to</text>
  <text start="160.47" dur="3.39">continually push this recovery as hard</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="2.31">as they possibly can to make everyone</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="2.67">believe</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="4.32">that this holiday season is fantastic</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="5.879">but we&amp;#39;re seeing right now the opposite</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="6.15">is happening now we understand the you</text>
  <text start="172.409" dur="4.381">wan remember China is going to be</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="3.839">pushing this to become a reserve</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="4.38">currency now on Monday the IMF is going</text>
  <text start="178.739" dur="5.25">to look at this but Russia decided they</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="6.299">are going to basically take the Chinese</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="6.991">you want into its reserve currency</text>
  <text start="187.469" dur="5.431">basket and this move is expected to</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="5.729">boost the you want presence in Russians</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="7.32">financial markets and this is coming out</text>
  <text start="196.709" dur="6.601">right before the IMF decides on Monday</text>
  <text start="200.22" dur="4.56">and most likely everyone is expecting</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="3.69">the IMF unless the United States comes</text>
  <text start="204.78" dur="4.47">along and tries to put the kibosh on</text>
  <text start="207" dur="5.069">this that the Chinese you wanna remove</text>
  <text start="209.25" dur="6.659">will be the reserve currency included in</text>
  <text start="212.069" dur="7.32">the SDR basket and basically at this</text>
  <text start="215.909" dur="7.8">point in time the big push to go from</text>
  <text start="219.389" dur="7.08">west to east is now on and as more and</text>
  <text start="223.709" dur="5.011">more countries take on the one they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="226.469" dur="4.92">going to push out the dollar so we see</text>
  <text start="228.72" dur="5.639">what&amp;#39;s happening at this point we see</text>
  <text start="231.389" dur="4.861">the white house was on lockdown am and</text>
  <text start="234.359" dur="4.47">raped an American flag climbed over the</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="5.4">fence and jumped onto the front lawn</text>
  <text start="238.829" dur="4.5">during Thanksgiving so the spikes on top</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="5.61">of the fence they are not enough the</text>
  <text start="243.329" dur="6.451">poppers own is not enough so I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="5.25">be surprised if they come out and say</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="5.909">okay we need electrified fences or a</text>
  <text start="252.51" dur="4.86">bigger barrier because of this and we</text>
  <text start="255.689" dur="4.05">can see this has been the push to</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="4.589">continually take the government</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="4.471">buildings and the people and completely</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="5.49">separate them because we know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="5.28">coming we know exactly why they are</text>
  <text start="267.449" dur="5.761">doing this it&amp;#39;s because the system</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="6.239">around us is collapsing and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="273.21" dur="5.459">trying to protect themselves they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="275.729" dur="5.361">nervous they&amp;#39;re afraid their biggest</text>
  <text start="278.669" dur="6.03">fear is many people coming up and</text>
  <text start="281.09" dur="8.169">protesting in front of the government</text>
  <text start="284.699" dur="7.981">buildings now France is moving to</text>
  <text start="289.259" dur="5.16">basically get rid of all alternative</text>
  <text start="292.68" dur="3.84">media I mean the British government is</text>
  <text start="294.419" dur="3.891">doing this and now Frances saying that</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="5.08">all conspiracy theory</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;ll be illegal by government decree</text>
  <text start="301.6" dur="5.08">now it started off with Charlie head bow</text>
  <text start="304.07" dur="5.58">and they decided to take this a step</text>
  <text start="306.68" dur="5.36">forward now this is the same country</text>
  <text start="309.65" dur="6.93">with a marched along for freedom of</text>
  <text start="312.04" dur="7.12">speech freedom of journalism freedom of</text>
  <text start="316.58" dur="5.25">expression and here they want to do is</text>
  <text start="319.16" dur="5.25">basically get rid of all those sites</text>
  <text start="321.83" dur="6.53">that don&amp;#39;t agree with the government</text>
  <text start="324.41" dur="6.96">narrative now in order to achieve this</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="5.41">what they need to do is basically take</text>
  <text start="331.37" dur="4.59">any website or anyone else that does not</text>
  <text start="333.77" dur="5.94">agree with the government and say you</text>
  <text start="335.96" dur="7.86">know it&amp;#39;s terrorism it&amp;#39;s a conspiracy</text>
  <text start="339.71" dur="7.2">theory and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.82" dur="5.19">doing at this point so earlier this week</text>
  <text start="346.91" dur="4.71">the Internet interior minister of france</text>
  <text start="349.01" dur="5.94">with no court review or adversarial</text>
  <text start="351.62" dur="5.4">process ordered five websites to not</text>
  <text start="354.95" dur="4.35">only be blocked in france but that</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="4.92">anyone who visits any of the sites get</text>
  <text start="359.3" dur="4.86">redirected to a scary-looking government</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="4.5">website saying you are being redirected</text>
  <text start="364.16" dur="4.02">to this official website since your</text>
  <text start="366.44" dur="4.29">computer was about to connect with a</text>
  <text start="368.18" dur="6.3">page that provokes terrorist acts or</text>
  <text start="370.73" dur="6.66">condones terrorism publicly of course</text>
  <text start="374.48" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s no proof they&amp;#39;re just doing this</text>
  <text start="377.39" dur="6.42">to certain websites trying to keep the</text>
  <text start="380.15" dur="5.82">story as a governmental story they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="383.81" dur="4.41">want outside websites reporting on</text>
  <text start="385.97" dur="3.63">things they don&amp;#39;t want reported and</text>
  <text start="388.22" dur="3.36">we&amp;#39;re going to see this spread around</text>
  <text start="389.6" dur="4.82">too many of the european countries</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="5.04">because this is the model and once this</text>
  <text start="394.42" dur="3.37">catches on we&amp;#39;re going to see spain</text>
  <text start="396.62" dur="3.09">which they&amp;#39;ve started to do with</text>
  <text start="397.79" dur="3.81">protesting and things like that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.71" dur="3.18">going to see the UK we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="401.6" dur="3.24">many other countries throughout europe</text>
  <text start="402.89" dur="5.31">do this and it will come back here to</text>
  <text start="404.84" dur="6.6">the United States now China in Africa</text>
  <text start="408.2" dur="5.73">right now they are building their first</text>
  <text start="411.44" dur="4.44">military base in Africa right in</text>
  <text start="413.93" dur="5.55">Djibouti now we know the United States</text>
  <text start="415.88" dur="6.54">has a base there as well now China has</text>
  <text start="419.48" dur="5.4">been pushing into Africa spending a lot</text>
  <text start="422.42" dur="5.52">of money on infrastructure helping build</text>
  <text start="424.88" dur="4.41">highways hospitals schools and on the</text>
  <text start="427.94" dur="3.72">other hand the United States is in there</text>
  <text start="429.29" dur="2.73">saying terror terror terror let us bring</text>
  <text start="431.66" dur="1.71">our me</text>
  <text start="432.02" dur="3.119">Terry into this area because wherever</text>
  <text start="433.37" dur="4.44">Russia and China are this is where the</text>
  <text start="435.139" dur="4.981">United States has to be so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.81" dur="4.5">seeing right now China has signed a</text>
  <text start="440.12" dur="4.74">10-year agreement they&amp;#39;re building a</text>
  <text start="442.31" dur="5.789">base right on the Red Sea and the base</text>
  <text start="444.86" dur="5.04">will include a port and an airfield this</text>
  <text start="448.099" dur="3.75">moves signals that china is shifting</text>
  <text start="449.9" dur="4.049">from an offshore defense to an open seas</text>
  <text start="451.849" dur="4.44">protection and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="453.949" dur="7.141">if we see some type of terrorism happen</text>
  <text start="456.289" dur="8.821">in this area now out in Ukraine what are</text>
  <text start="461.09" dur="6.96">we seeing well the power outage is still</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="6.32">going on Kiev is not giving a clear</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="7.53">assessment of Crimea energy blockade and</text>
  <text start="471.43" dur="6.37">right now Russia is calling for Ukraine</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="4.41">to say what is going on here they</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="4.549">understand there was a blast that took</text>
  <text start="479.99" dur="5.25">out the power transmission lines and</text>
  <text start="482.349" dur="6.731">they&amp;#39;re wondering why is it taking so</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="7.049">long to bring the power back up Ukraine</text>
  <text start="489.08" dur="5.1">has not paid for their gas and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="492.289" dur="3.271">saying that they have better options to</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="2.93">buy the gas of course what they did was</text>
  <text start="495.56" dur="5.34">they filled up all their tanks and</text>
  <text start="497.11" dur="5.739">they&amp;#39;re not purchasing any gas from</text>
  <text start="500.9" dur="5.609">Russia at this point they&amp;#39;re separating</text>
  <text start="502.849" dur="6.18">themselves once again from Russia and it</text>
  <text start="506.509" dur="3.931">looks like Kiev is intending to delay</text>
  <text start="509.029" dur="4.021">the implementation of the Minsk</text>
  <text start="510.44" dur="4.2">agreements for Ukraine settlement the</text>
  <text start="513.05" dur="3.32">latest events confirm that Kiev will do</text>
  <text start="514.64" dur="4.949">everything to delay the implementation</text>
  <text start="516.37" dur="5.609">in particularly political part which is</text>
  <text start="519.589" dur="4.981">the agreement with dumb bath or ities on</text>
  <text start="521.979" dur="5.291">basically having local elections and</text>
  <text start="524.57" dur="4.74">being separate and apart from Ukraine</text>
  <text start="527.27" dur="4.189">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="529.31" dur="5.01">talking about renewing the Mint&amp;#39;s to at</text>
  <text start="531.459" dur="4.181">the beginning of next year so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.32" dur="3.959">going to have to watch that situation</text>
  <text start="535.64" dur="4.86">very click click closely because we see</text>
  <text start="538.279" dur="6.18">things starting to ramp up in that area</text>
  <text start="540.5" dur="7.1">now Russia because of the down jet of</text>
  <text start="544.459" dur="6.87">the su-24 is striking back at Turkey</text>
  <text start="547.6" dur="6.489">basically turkey initially benefited</text>
  <text start="551.329" dur="4.851">from Russia&amp;#39;s food embargo well it looks</text>
  <text start="554.089" dur="4.44">like Russia saying we might be</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="4.18">sanctioning some of the food that comes</text>
  <text start="558.529" dur="4.17">to Russia right now the agricultural and</text>
  <text start="560.36" dur="3.99">food security watchdog said that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.699" dur="6.331">going to be inspecting Turkey</text>
  <text start="564.35" dur="7.08">food to laboratory checks and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="569.03" dur="5.25">going to be pulling products out that</text>
  <text start="571.43" dur="5.88">don&amp;#39;t meet their quality quality control</text>
  <text start="574.28" dur="4.35">like meats fruits things like that so it</text>
  <text start="577.31" dur="4.56">looks like they&amp;#39;re putting up some type</text>
  <text start="578.63" dur="5.67">of sanction on Turkey&amp;#39;s food rush is</text>
  <text start="581.87" dur="3.99">also suspending the party participation</text>
  <text start="584.3" dur="3.75">in the Black Sea for drills after</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="5.4">turkeys downing of the Russian jet they</text>
  <text start="588.05" dur="5.64">are basically ending all military drills</text>
  <text start="591.26" dur="4.8">at this point now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="593.69" dur="6.72">interesting is that the son of Aragon</text>
  <text start="596.06" dur="8.19">below basically he seems like he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="600.41" dur="7.14">mastermind of siphoning and moving the</text>
  <text start="604.25" dur="5.24">oil from Syria and Iraq into Turkey and</text>
  <text start="607.55" dur="5.37">then selling it off to other markets and</text>
  <text start="609.49" dur="6.01">it starts with the be MZ group which is</text>
  <text start="612.92" dur="4.56">the name implicated most often in the</text>
  <text start="615.5" dur="4.89">smuggling of illegal Iraqi and Islamic</text>
  <text start="617.48" dur="7.35">state through to Western supply chains</text>
  <text start="620.39" dur="6.69">and arrogance son is like the silent</text>
  <text start="624.83" dur="4.68">mastermind who&amp;#39;s been responsible</text>
  <text start="627.08" dur="4.71">converting millions of barrels of Syrian</text>
  <text start="629.51" dur="5.85">oil into hundreds of millions of dollars</text>
  <text start="631.79" dur="4.98">for the Islamic state and we know this</text>
  <text start="635.36" dur="3.54">this is why the United States never went</text>
  <text start="636.77" dur="3.93">and bomb the convoys because they knew</text>
  <text start="638.9" dur="3.36">exactly what was happening and as we</text>
  <text start="640.7" dur="5.28">know the Islamic state was trained by</text>
  <text start="642.26" dur="6.78">the US Israel and other coalition forces</text>
  <text start="645.98" dur="5.55">and now it emerges by Turkish Special</text>
  <text start="649.04" dur="4.89">Forces at sukkur bases in Konya province</text>
  <text start="651.53" dur="5.61">inside the Turkish border to Syria that</text>
  <text start="653.93" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;ve been training in this area the</text>
  <text start="657.14" dur="5.31">prime source of money feeding Isis these</text>
  <text start="659.51" dur="6.36">days is the sale of Iraqi oil from</text>
  <text start="662.45" dur="7.13">muscle and basically it looks like</text>
  <text start="665.87" dur="6.78">arrogance son is handling all of this</text>
  <text start="669.58" dur="4.93">Bilal he owns several maritime companies</text>
  <text start="672.65" dur="4.17">he is allegedly signed contracts with</text>
