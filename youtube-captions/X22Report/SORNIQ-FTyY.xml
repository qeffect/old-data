  <text start="107.47" dur="4.05">going to be talking about that in just a</text>
  <text start="109.54" dur="4.439">moment but first I wanted to head out to</text>
  <text start="111.52" dur="5.61">the eurozone because I do believe the</text>
  <text start="113.979" dur="7.17">eurozone is in trouble look what we see</text>
  <text start="117.13" dur="7.29">happening right now in the UK Theresa</text>
  <text start="121.149" dur="7.891">May is out and the brexit deal the No</text>
  <text start="124.42" dur="7.68">Deal brexit is on the table and the</text>
  <text start="129.04" dur="5.16">Europeans the eurozone they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="132.1" dur="4.979">this remember the eurozone is the non</text>
  <text start="134.2" dur="7.259">elected leaders that are trying to push</text>
  <text start="137.079" dur="8.281">their agenda on all the countries we see</text>
  <text start="141.459" dur="6.961">Italy they&amp;#39;re looking at a new currency</text>
  <text start="145.36" dur="9.57">that will run parallel to the euro and</text>
  <text start="148.42" dur="10.629">guess what the individuals in the ECB</text>
  <text start="154.93" dur="7.99">eurozone they don&amp;#39;t like this and there</text>
  <text start="159.049" dur="6.03">is a crisis that is brewing and we might</text>
  <text start="162.92" dur="3.48">even see the eurozone break up now</text>
  <text start="165.079" dur="4.141">you&amp;#39;re probably saying why am I saying</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="6.119">this well before I begin let me just</text>
  <text start="169.22" dur="7.109">define what a mini is and what a bot is</text>
  <text start="172.519" dur="6.601">Bo T so bot stands for ordinary Treasury</text>
  <text start="176.329" dur="5.22">bonds mini means the Dom the</text>
  <text start="179.12" dur="4.32">denomination is smaller than the lowest</text>
  <text start="181.549" dur="4.171">denomination of a regular Treasury bond</text>
  <text start="183.44" dur="6.06">which is around a thousand euros thus</text>
  <text start="185.72" dur="6.78">minibot so let&amp;#39;s break down what is</text>
  <text start="189.5" dur="5.909">happening right now out in Italy now the</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="5.519">two parties that make up the fractious</text>
  <text start="195.409" dur="4.98">governing alliance the hard right League</text>
  <text start="198.019" dur="5.011">and the five star movement want to</text>
  <text start="200.389" dur="4.801">introduce a new type of government bond</text>
  <text start="203.03" dur="3.45">that would be used to pay off the</text>
  <text start="205.19" dur="4.74">state&amp;#39;s debts to companies and</text>
  <text start="206.48" dur="6.3">individuals both the league and five</text>
  <text start="209.93" dur="5.07">star are deeply Euroskeptic and have in</text>
  <text start="212.78" dur="5.16">the past mooted the idea of abandoning</text>
  <text start="215" dur="5.129">the common currency with Matteo salvini</text>
  <text start="217.94" dur="4.139">the league&amp;#39;s competitive leader last</text>
  <text start="220.129" dur="4.411">year calling the euro a mistaken</text>
  <text start="222.079" dur="6.211">Experion experiment that has damaged</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="7.559">jobs and the Italian economy the idea of</text>
  <text start="228.29" dur="5.64">introducing mini bots has alarmed Europe</text>
  <text start="232.099" dur="3.871">with Mario Draghi the head of the</text>
  <text start="233.93" dur="3.839">European Central Bank saying on Thursday</text>
  <text start="235.97" dur="4.139">that they would either amount to a</text>
  <text start="237.769" dur="4.741">parallel currency in which case they</text>
  <text start="240.109" dur="5.401">would be illegal or they would simply</text>
  <text start="242.51" dur="4.979">add to Italy&amp;#39;s towering debt or would it</text>
  <text start="245.51" dur="4.289">I mean that&amp;#39;s what the central bank is</text>
  <text start="247.489" dur="4.921">saying but is this really what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="249.799" dur="5.52">to happen or are they going to use it to</text>
  <text start="252.41" dur="5.1">move away from the eurozone and can be</text>
  <text start="255.319" dur="3.301">and be completely independent and we</text>
  <text start="257.51" dur="3.539">need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="258.62" dur="4.74">important everything is hitting at once</text>
  <text start="261.049" dur="4.59">think about it at the moment France is</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="5.119">in breach of economic rules there is</text>
  <text start="265.639" dur="5.881">this little thing called the brexit and</text>
  <text start="268.479" dur="6.701">Italy is looking to start their own</text>
  <text start="271.52" dur="6.179">currency now Italy&amp;#39;s budget is not close</text>
  <text start="275.18" dur="4.95">to meeting new rules the EU has</text>
  <text start="277.699" dur="6.44">threatened excessive deficit procedures</text>
  <text start="280.13" dur="7.14">and Italy is trying to fight back</text>
  <text start="284.139" dur="6.641">the longer the EU waits</text>
  <text start="287.27" dur="6.81">the more time Italy has to prepare for</text>
  <text start="290.78" dur="6.81">their mini bot launch once they launch</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="6.45">their mini bot well the EU is going to</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="6.54">be in trouble and Italy is set to leave</text>
  <text start="300.53" dur="6.59">the eurozone then and the mini bot is</text>
  <text start="304.13" dur="5.49">going to be the transition mechanism</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="6.1">which they will use to separate</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="6.18">themselves from the eurozone I believe</text>
  <text start="313.22" dur="5.37">this is already planned out and I think</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="4.799">the eurozone those days they are</text>
  <text start="318.59" dur="2.569">numbered right now because really think</text>
  <text start="320.599" dur="4.771">about it</text>
  <text start="321.159" dur="7.54">once the UK leaves with their No Deal</text>
  <text start="325.37" dur="5.28">and Italy leaves you think France is</text>
  <text start="328.699" dur="4.351">gonna follow you think Germany then is</text>
  <text start="330.65" dur="4.109">gonna say ok wait this is not happening</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="3.959">this is bad you think Hungary is gonna</text>
  <text start="334.759" dur="5.731">say oh let&amp;#39;s stay in there no a lot of</text>
  <text start="337.009" dur="6.15">these countries are going to move out of</text>
  <text start="340.49" dur="6.66">this system remember this was set up as</text>
  <text start="343.159" dur="8.221">a globalist system and countries are</text>
  <text start="347.15" dur="5.91">catching on they&amp;#39;re realizing what these</text>
  <text start="351.38" dur="3.81">non elected leaders the essential</text>
  <text start="353.06" dur="5.34">bankers were trying to do and it seems</text>
  <text start="355.19" dur="5.279">like now it is backfiring now very</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="4.62">interestingly Trump has been talking</text>
  <text start="360.469" dur="5.461">about how that tariffs are going to work</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="4.769">in the favor of the United States he</text>
  <text start="365.93" dur="3.419">says that company is going to be looking</text>
  <text start="367.789" dur="3.301">to get out of China they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="369.349" dur="4.38">moving to maybe other countries or</text>
  <text start="371.09" dur="5.759">moving to the United States well we know</text>
  <text start="373.729" dur="5.581">that Foxconn they warned that we might</text>
  <text start="376.849" dur="5.011">be moving out an apple right now is</text>
  <text start="379.31" dur="4.44">saying listen we might be moving about</text>
  <text start="381.86" dur="4.83">fifteen to thirty percent of our</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="5.969">production outside of the mainland and</text>
  <text start="386.69" dur="6.539">we might be moving it to India Vietnam</text>
  <text start="389.719" dur="5.07">Mexico maybe even Malaysia and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="393.229" dur="5.461">very interesting about this is that</text>
  <text start="394.789" dur="5.341">Trump visited all these places and he</text>
  <text start="398.69" dur="3.75">knew that this was going to happen</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="4.439">he knew that corporations manufacturers</text>
  <text start="402.44" dur="3.81">were going to be moving out of China and</text>
  <text start="404.569" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;ll be and they would be picking</text>
  <text start="406.25" dur="3.449">these other countries and I do believe</text>
  <text start="408.259" dur="4.681">that Trump like we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="409.699" dur="6.181">before has already made deals with these</text>
  <text start="412.94" dur="5.67">other countries and we&amp;#39;re watching it</text>
  <text start="415.88" dur="3.99">happen right now and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="418.61" dur="2.25">there&amp;#39;s going to be many other countries</text>
  <text start="419.87" dur="3.99">that</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="6.23">we&amp;#39;ll be moving out of China now very</text>
  <text start="423.86" dur="5.64">interestingly we know that Trump is</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="6.699">controlling the narrative of the economy</text>
  <text start="429.5" dur="6.569">we know that the Dems they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="433.789" dur="4.861">anything about it yes they can say that</text>
  <text start="436.069" dur="4.951">they can make it better or the tax cuts</text>
  <text start="438.65" dur="4.019">are no good and they could make up</text>
  <text start="441.02" dur="6.209">different stories but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="442.669" dur="8.49">interesting is Joe Biden he is out there</text>
  <text start="447.229" dur="7.5">and he&amp;#39;s taking credit for the economy</text>
  <text start="451.159" dur="6.331">that Trump is working on right now so</text>
  <text start="454.729" dur="5.49">Biden is not in the office Obama is not</text>
  <text start="457.49" dur="5.429">in the office Trump is in the office for</text>
  <text start="460.219" dur="7.38">two and a half years now going on his</text>
  <text start="462.919" dur="8.851">third and Biden tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="467.599" dur="6.54">following hey there at team Joe here</text>
  <text start="471.77" dur="4.739">president Trump dismisses everything he</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="5.64">doesn&amp;#39;t want to hear as fake news so as</text>
  <text start="476.509" dur="5.731">he announces his re-election we want to</text>
  <text start="479.779" dur="4.95">make sure you have the real facts on his</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="4.709">record let&amp;#39;s be clear president Trump</text>
  <text start="484.729" dur="4.53">inherited a growing economy from the</text>
  <text start="486.949" dur="5.69">obama-biden administration and now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.259" dur="8.071">in the process of squandering it really</text>
  <text start="492.639" dur="7.18">what Trump has done is he&amp;#39;s using all of</text>
  <text start="497.33" dur="5.25">their weapons that they used before and</text>
  <text start="499.819" dur="4.861">I hate to say it Obama and Biden the</text>
  <text start="502.58" dur="5.78">economy was not that great remember what</text>
  <text start="504.68" dur="7.529">they were telling us get used to 2% GDP</text>
  <text start="508.36" dur="6.7">get used to having no jobs get used to</text>
  <text start="512.209" dur="5.161">having low pay get used to this because</text>
  <text start="515.06" dur="4.83">what they were really doing was they</text>
  <text start="517.37" dur="5.969">were preparing the economy to be a third</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="7.009">world economy Trump use their</text>
  <text start="523.339" dur="6.631">manipulation and used it against them</text>
  <text start="526.899" dur="5.461">remember remember the argument that he</text>
  <text start="529.97" dur="4.979">had with Obama about the magic wand</text>
  <text start="532.36" dur="4.81">where Obama was telling the voters that</text>
  <text start="534.949" dur="4.82">Trump we need a magic wand to bring back</text>
  <text start="537.17" dur="5.669">manufacturing jobs United States well</text>
  <text start="539.769" dur="6.94">guess what he&amp;#39;s got the magic wand and</text>
  <text start="542.839" dur="5.551">he&amp;#39;s using it and he&amp;#39;s taking this</text>
  <text start="546.709" dur="3.931">economy which they told us was not going</text>
  <text start="548.39" dur="4.41">to grow which they were telling us that</text>
  <text start="550.64" dur="3.689">there were gonna be no other jobs which</text>
  <text start="552.8" dur="4.349">they were telling us that</text>
  <text start="554.329" dur="4.38">think you can&amp;#39;t do anything with look</text>
  <text start="557.149" dur="3.54">what Trump has done now we know it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="558.709" dur="3.99">statistical because he&amp;#39;s using the</text>
  <text start="560.689" dur="6.56">weapons against them but he&amp;#39;s taken it</text>
  <text start="562.699" dur="7.5">and he&amp;#39;s pushed it to the nth degree and</text>
  <text start="567.249" dur="6.76">Biden the only weapon II has right now</text>
  <text start="570.199" dur="5.281">is to say yet this is my economy I mean</text>
  <text start="574.009" dur="2.971">this is just absolute ridiculous do you</text>
  <text start="575.48" dur="3.029">think he&amp;#39;d be saying if the economy</text>
  <text start="576.98" dur="4.62">failed do you think he&amp;#39;d be saying well</text>
  <text start="578.509" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s my economy no I mean really if</text>
  <text start="581.6" dur="4.26">you really think about it what were they</text>
  <text start="583.429" dur="4.62">planning they were planning on bringing</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="3.479">the economy down that&amp;#39;s why the Fed was</text>
  <text start="588.049" dur="4.14">raising rates I mean this is a very</text>
  <text start="589.339" dur="4.831">simple formula raise the rates in a fake</text>
  <text start="592.189" dur="3.9">economy you bring the whole entire</text>
  <text start="594.17" dur="3.629">system down because the fake economy was</text>
  <text start="596.089" dur="5.19">supported by low interest rates and</text>
  <text start="597.799" dur="5.15">stimulus lower the rates add stimulus</text>
  <text start="601.279" dur="4.68">the statistical numbers look great</text>
  <text start="602.949" dur="4.93">doesn&amp;#39;t mean the economy&amp;#39;s better the</text>
  <text start="605.959" dur="5.31">economy&amp;#39;s awful this is a central bank</text>
  <text start="607.879" dur="6.15">economy which is dying right now and the</text>
  <text start="611.269" dur="4.5">Fed came out and they said listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="614.029" dur="5.04">not going to be raising rates right now</text>
  <text start="615.769" dur="7.021">we&amp;#39;re holding steady and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="619.069" dur="4.98">what was planned why like I said it</text>
  <text start="622.79" dur="2.579">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they raise rates now I</text>
  <text start="624.049" dur="3.061">mean I rather have them raise rates</text>
  <text start="625.369" dur="4.981">right now to make sure that the economy</text>
  <text start="627.11" dur="4.68">is on a strong footing for the 2020</text>
  <text start="630.35" dur="4.079">elections but they&amp;#39;re gonna make a</text>
  <text start="631.79" dur="5.489">decision in July so here we are in June</text>
  <text start="634.429" dur="5.431">and the reason why I do believe they did</text>
  <text start="637.279" dur="5.22">it this way it&amp;#39;s because of the</text>
  <text start="639.86" dur="5.37">independent factor they wanted to make</text>
  <text start="642.499" dur="6.541">sure that the Fed looked completely</text>
  <text start="645.23" dur="6.87">independent and they prepared their</text>
  <text start="649.04" dur="5.339">narrative that there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="652.1" dur="5.01">rate cut in July I think that&amp;#39;s up to</text>
  <text start="654.379" dur="5.37">80% now the rate cut for June was around</text>
  <text start="657.11" dur="5.93">23% and now they&amp;#39;re looking at 80%</text>
  <text start="659.749" dur="6.18">chance of a rate cut around 80 percent</text>
