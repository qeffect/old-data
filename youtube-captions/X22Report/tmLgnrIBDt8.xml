  <text start="172.73" dur="5.46">hate to say this but let&amp;#39;s just use our</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="6.66">common sense if you have a family and</text>
  <text start="178.19" dur="6.269">their income is fifty thousand dollars a</text>
  <text start="180.92" dur="7.34">year and you have ten credit cards</text>
  <text start="184.459" dur="8.101">they&amp;#39;re all maxed out each one is that</text>
  <text start="188.26" dur="6.67">$15,000 let&amp;#39;s say see if ten credit card</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="3.81">is 15,000 that&amp;#39;s 150 thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="194.93" dur="3.57">were at the debt you have a</text>
  <text start="196.37" dur="4.29">fifty-thousand-dollar income you throw</text>
  <text start="198.5" dur="4.86">on another credit card because you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="200.66" dur="5.04">make the payments on the credit card you</text>
  <text start="203.36" dur="5.58">already have and you get another one for</text>
  <text start="205.7" dur="5.759">15,000 yeah that keeps you going for a</text>
  <text start="208.94" dur="5.13">little while but what eventually happens</text>
  <text start="211.459" dur="4.861">you keep charging on that new credit</text>
  <text start="214.07" dur="4.169">card to pay for those payments to pay</text>
  <text start="216.32" dur="4.229">for your food to pay for your rent or</text>
  <text start="218.239" dur="5.401">mortgage and eventually you max out that</text>
  <text start="220.549" dur="5.341">credit card now you have to do the same</text>
  <text start="223.64" dur="7.89">thing over and over and before you know</text>
  <text start="225.89" dur="9.54">it your debt one from 150,000 to 250,000</text>
  <text start="231.53" dur="7.28">and what do you have coming in still</text>
  <text start="235.43" dur="7.529">fifty thousand dollars a year so a debt</text>
  <text start="238.81" dur="6.76">this debt bailout will never ever work</text>
  <text start="242.959" dur="5.011">it will never make things better it will</text>
  <text start="245.57" dur="5.07">just make them worse and that&amp;#39;s why when</text>
  <text start="247.97" dur="5.85">they tell you they only need the one</text>
  <text start="250.64" dur="7.62">bailout oh I&amp;#39;m sorry now they need the</text>
  <text start="253.82" dur="7.919">two bailouts and it just it just it just</text>
  <text start="258.26" dur="5.61">doesn&amp;#39;t work and there&amp;#39;s I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.739" dur="6.471">proof of it you could see from all</text>
  <text start="263.87" dur="4.34">around the world it&amp;#39;s just not working</text>
  <text start="269.46" dur="7.019">it looks like the eurozone bank crisis</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="8.58">is spreading to other countries like</text>
  <text start="276.479" dur="6.66">Spain and Italy and they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="4.77">about the same exact thing that there</text>
  <text start="283.139" dur="5.911">that they didn&amp;#39;t Cyprus to Spain and</text>
  <text start="285.96" dur="6.09">Italy so we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="289.05" dur="4.89">starting to spread people are starting</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="4.35">to take some money out of the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.94" dur="4.68">because they do not trust the banks and</text>
  <text start="296.4" dur="7.56">they&amp;#39;re afraid that their money is going</text>
  <text start="298.62" dur="9.389">to be sucked away like it is in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="303.96" dur="5.82">so that is something that we need to</text>
  <text start="308.009" dur="3.72">keep an eye on and we knew this was</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="5.97">coming I mean this is there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="7.681">that this is just a a one-off incident</text>
  <text start="315.75" dur="6.27">that just happening in Cyprus and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.41" dur="5.97">not happening in any part of the world I</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="6.119">mean if you look at Spain if you look at</text>
  <text start="325.38" dur="5.909">Italy if you look at the whole European</text>
  <text start="328.139" dur="4.62">community it&amp;#39;s not getting better even</text>
  <text start="331.289" dur="3.69">though the mainstream media tells us</text>
  <text start="332.759" dur="6.331">it&amp;#39;s getting better and things are</text>
  <text start="334.979" dur="5.97">looking good it really isn&amp;#39;t and just</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="5.699">like they said if you&amp;#39;ll think about it</text>
  <text start="340.949" dur="6.601">a couple months ago the Euro the europe</text>
  <text start="344.789" dur="4.44">european community said everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="5.07">good you never really hurt anything and</text>
  <text start="349.229" dur="5.791">then all of a sudden Cyprus and this is</text>
  <text start="352.62" dur="4.38">because they&amp;#39;re covering it up and when</text>
  <text start="355.02" dur="6.84">they can&amp;#39;t cover it up anymore that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357" dur="8.88">when it comes out now in Cyprus they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.86" dur="6.54">planning on opening the banks on</text>
  <text start="365.88" dur="5.009">Thursday now of course they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="368.4" dur="8.009">have capital controls people will not be</text>
  <text start="370.889" dur="8.34">able to take out money they have a limit</text>
  <text start="376.409" dur="4.44">of what they can take out those accounts</text>
  <text start="379.229" dur="6.72">over a hundred thousand will be frozen</text>
  <text start="380.849" dur="10.921">and they&amp;#39;re putting extra security</text>
  <text start="385.949" dur="8.131">around the banks just in case Betty just</text>
  <text start="391.77" dur="5.07">in case there is some type of bank run</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="4.92">and I&amp;#39;m thinking to myself well just in</text>
  <text start="396.84" dur="3.99">case you know definitely there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="399" dur="3.06">to be a bank run that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.83" dur="2.1">putting the security people there</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="2.04">because</text>
  <text start="402.93" dur="6.54">would want to keep their money in the</text>
  <text start="404.1" dur="9.36">bank and them to dictate how much you</text>
  <text start="409.47" dur="6.21">can take out then the tick date that you</text>
  <text start="413.46" dur="5.25">can&amp;#39;t access any of your money or</text>
  <text start="415.68" dur="6.87">transfer it so of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.71" dur="7.26">expecting bank runs and you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="422.55" dur="6.63">see this completely have a domino effect</text>
  <text start="425.97" dur="5.699">and move across Europe and I know</text>
  <text start="429.18" dur="4.23">Bernanke said that you know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="431.669" dur="4.47">going to affect us in your night in the</text>
  <text start="433.41" dur="5.55">United States but you know when things</text>
  <text start="436.139" dur="8.491">spread and things go viral there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="10.65">stopping it it just goes now as Cyprus</text>
  <text start="444.63" dur="6.93">reopens the bank&amp;#39;s the capital controls</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="3.72">of course are going to be you know</text>
  <text start="451.56" dur="3.78">limiting withdrawals but they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="6.72">to be banning checks and curbing the use</text>
  <text start="455.34" dur="7.079">of Cypriot credit cards abroad us this</text>

  <text start="534.329" dur="6.051">the biggest cyber attack</text>
  <text start="537.13" dur="5.08">in history right now no I mean in</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="4.95">history it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s been going on for</text>
  <text start="542.21" dur="4.59">like 45 years it&amp;#39;s been like a year or</text>
  <text start="545.33" dur="6.81">two that they actually started reporting</text>
  <text start="546.8" dur="9.63">about cyber attacks but they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="552.14" dur="6.54">that this is really big because they</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="5.46">were being inundated with 300 billion</text>
  <text start="558.68" dur="5.7">bits per second of data three times</text>
  <text start="561.89" dur="6.39">larger than the previous record attack</text>
  <text start="564.38" dur="7.29">of a hundred billion bits per second so</text>
  <text start="568.28" dur="6.18">it tripled the amount now for those</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="5.91">people who do not know what this means</text>

  <text start="580.19" dur="8.64">is a DDoS attack which is it which is a</text>
  <text start="586.46" dur="8.76">distributed denial-of-service attack and</text>
  <text start="588.83" dur="9.42">what they normally do is they send tons</text>
  <text start="595.22" dur="8.67">of traffic from many different locations</text>
  <text start="598.25" dur="9.3">to the one server and what happens when</text>
  <text start="603.89" dur="6.27">they do this the resources usually</text>
  <text start="607.55" dur="8.25">become unavailable or slowed down</text>
  <text start="610.16" dur="8.82">dramatically and it makes it so you</text>
