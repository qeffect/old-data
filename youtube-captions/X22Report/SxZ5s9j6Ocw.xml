  <text start="155.879" dur="5.171">the reason why is because they don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="197.95" dur="4.2">they continually want more and more</text>
  <text start="199.93" dur="4.74">revenue coming into the bank because the</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="5.07">banks are insolvent they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="204.67" dur="4.17">stay afloat until they get that balony</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="4.14">because that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re headed right</text>
  <text start="208.84" dur="5.04">now we&amp;#39;re headed to that point in time</text>
  <text start="211.36" dur="4.14">where eventually those bail and</text>
  <text start="213.88" dur="3.99">documents they&amp;#39;re going to pull them out</text>
  <text start="215.5" dur="4.44">and say don&amp;#39;t worry we have a solution</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="5.22">we saw it in Cyprus that was a test case</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="4.83">they tried to do it in Greece but things</text>
  <text start="223.09" dur="3.41">went south because people started to</text>
  <text start="224.77" dur="4.38">take their funds out of the bank and</text>
  <text start="226.5" dur="4.51">here in the United States we see things</text>
  <text start="229.15" dur="4.44">that are completely breaking down right</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="4.95">now we look at the student loan crisis</text>
  <text start="233.59" dur="3.54">now according to new data that was</text>
  <text start="235.96" dur="3.36">published by the US Department of</text>
  <text start="237.13" dur="5.04">Education a hundred and thirty seven</text>
  <text start="239.32" dur="6.02">billion dollars of federal student loans</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="5.82">were in default as of December of 2016 a</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="4.78">fourteen percent year-over-year increase</text>
  <text start="247.99" dur="4.26">and key findings from the Consumer</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="4.32">Federation of America says the following</text>
  <text start="252.25" dur="4.049">average amount owed is about thirty</text>
  <text start="254.44" dur="4.89">thousand six hundred fifty dollars per</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="6.571">federal student loan borrower 1 million</text>
  <text start="259.33" dur="5.07">direct loan defaults in 2016 in 2016 1.1</text>
  <text start="262.87" dur="4.02">million federal direct loan borrowers</text>
  <text start="264.4" dur="4.7">defaulted federal law typically defines</text>
  <text start="266.89" dur="5.43">a federal student loan default as being</text>
  <text start="269.1" dur="5.47">270 days past due now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="272.32" dur="4.86">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="274.57" dur="4.53">the soaring defaults are continually</text>
  <text start="277.18" dur="4.26">happening despite Obama&amp;#39;s executive</text>
  <text start="279.1" dur="5.7">action setting up income-driven</text>
  <text start="281.44" dur="5.67">repayment plans IDRs and these are</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="5.1">specifically intended to lower the</text>
  <text start="287.11" dur="6.08">burden on bars and avoid defaults Obama</text>
  <text start="289.9" dur="5.46">so-called IDR plans set up camps on bars</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="4.66">monthly student loan payments at ten</text>
  <text start="295.36" dur="5.37">percent of discretionary income which is</text>
  <text start="297.85" dur="4.319">defined as earnings above one-hundred</text>
  <text start="300.73" dur="4.02">and fifty percent of the poverty level</text>
  <text start="302.169" dur="4.531">then whatever principal balance is left</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="4.47">over on the loans at their maturity date</text>
  <text start="306.7" dur="4.95">is simply forgiven which is government</text>
  <text start="309.22" dur="4.38">speak for yeah the taxpayers are going</text>
  <text start="311.65" dur="3.09">to lay out that money so any remaining</text>
  <text start="313.6" dur="4.62">balance</text>
  <text start="314.74" dur="5.97">then forgiven after 20 or 10 or 20 years</text>
  <text start="318.22" dur="4.43">depending on whether the borrower works</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="5.989">in the public or private sector so</text>
  <text start="322.65" dur="6.97">students are defaulting even though this</text>
  <text start="326.699" dur="6.31">income-driven repayment plan has been</text>
  <text start="329.62" dur="6.389">set up where they adjust the loan to</text>
  <text start="333.009" dur="6.361">what you are making and they adjust the</text>
  <text start="336.009" dur="6.271">payments to that and the students still</text>
  <text start="339.37" dur="5.76">can&amp;#39;t make the payments this is a</text>
  <text start="342.28" dur="5.85">complete disaster and student loan</text>
  <text start="345.13" dur="6.539">amounts continually rise they have not</text>
  <text start="348.13" dur="6.779">fallen they&amp;#39;ve gotten worse since 2008</text>
  <text start="351.669" dur="5.851">because as we know the system that the</text>
  <text start="354.909" dur="5.311">central banks have created going back to</text>
  <text start="357.52" dur="5.369">nineteen thirteen is a debt driven</text>
  <text start="360.22" dur="5.97">system now we can see that there is</text>
  <text start="362.889" dur="5.911">inflation which is being seen in the</text>
  <text start="366.19" dur="4.08">United States and Spain Germany and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.8" dur="4.23">starting to move over the two percent</text>
  <text start="370.27" dur="4.29">target that the central banks want the</text>
  <text start="373.03" dur="4.379">only thing that&amp;#39;s cute not keeping up</text>
  <text start="374.56" dur="5.639">with inflation right now is wage growth</text>
  <text start="377.409" dur="4.921">we see that real earnings have tumbled</text>
  <text start="380.199" dur="5.581">for this for the second straight month</text>
  <text start="382.33" dur="5.519">in a row and they are down by 0.3% now</text>
  <text start="385.78" dur="5.55">this is the first consecutive monthly</text>
  <text start="387.849" dur="6.111">drop in real wages since 2011 so real</text>
  <text start="391.33" dur="5.73">wages right now are falling and</text>
  <text start="393.96" dur="6.04">inflation is rising well this is not</text>
  <text start="397.06" dur="4.409">very good so the Fed right now as we</text>
  <text start="400" dur="5.49">know they just raised interest rates</text>
  <text start="401.469" dur="7.891">they are hiking into wages declining a</text>
  <text start="405.49" dur="5.97">weak economy and declining real wage</text>
  <text start="409.36" dur="5.25">growth does this seem like the right</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="6.359">time to do this it doesn&amp;#39;t to me now</text>
  <text start="414.61" dur="5.52">retail sales they have decelerated they</text>
  <text start="417.819" dur="4.5">were expecting a growth about 0.4% and</text>
  <text start="420.13" dur="3.629">it only came in at point one percent in</text>
  <text start="422.319" dur="3.541">the month of februari in the month of</text>
  <text start="423.759" dur="4.291">februari we have Valentine&amp;#39;s Day and</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="4.549">this wasn&amp;#39;t even enough to push it</text>
  <text start="428.05" dur="5.549">anywhere now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="430.409" dur="5.56">sales have dropped in Sporting Goods and</text>
  <text start="433.599" dur="4.38">music stores department stores food</text>
  <text start="435.969" dur="4.23">service and drinking places they all</text>
  <text start="437.979" dur="4.8">declined by negative point for by</text>
  <text start="440.199" dur="4.951">negative 1 point 1 and negative point 1</text>
  <text start="442.779" dur="4.801">percent the biggest drop came from</text>
  <text start="445.15" dur="3.24">electronics and appliance stores they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="447.58" dur="3.9">dropped by</text>
  <text start="448.39" dur="5.82">two point eight percent this is awful</text>
  <text start="451.48" dur="4.83">and department stores well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="3.57">imploding on themselves the latest</text>
  <text start="456.31" dur="3.48">monthly bank of america debit and credit</text>
  <text start="457.78" dur="3.66">card spending report shows that things</text>
  <text start="459.79" dur="4.32">may be about to get a whole lot worse</text>
  <text start="461.44" dur="4.95">for America&amp;#39;s department store because</text>
  <text start="464.11" dur="5.42">people are not going out and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="466.39" dur="6.45">shopping and we&amp;#39;re seeing sales revenue</text>
  <text start="469.53" dur="5.32">completely drop off it&amp;#39;s a disaster we</text>
  <text start="472.84" dur="4.98">see home builder confidence right now</text>
  <text start="474.85" dur="6">well it is hitting new highs we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="477.82" dur="5.94">almost back to where we were back prior</text>
  <text start="480.85" dur="6.12">to 2008 we&amp;#39;re home builder confidence</text>
  <text start="483.76" dur="5.58">was at its highest point and you know</text>
  <text start="486.97" dur="4.86">what happened after that the entire</text>
  <text start="489.34" dur="5.67">housing market completely fell upon it</text>
  <text start="491.83" dur="5.43">so here we are once again at that same</text>
  <text start="495.01" dur="4.8">point now the Atlanta Fed they keep</text>
  <text start="497.26" dur="4.26">revising the GDP they started out at</text>
  <text start="499.81" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;re going to hit four percent this</text>
  <text start="501.52" dur="4.73">year they came down to two point eight</text>
  <text start="503.29" dur="5.16">percent they came down to one point nine</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="4.59">percent they came down to one point two</text>
  <text start="508.45" dur="4.8">percent and here we are at point nine</text>
  <text start="510.84" dur="5.56">percent and remember something very</text>
  <text start="513.25" dur="6.15">important this is the manipulated number</text>
  <text start="516.4" dur="6.329">if you strip out the manipulation this</text>
  <text start="519.4" dur="5.7">is a negative territory so we start to</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="4.021">put all this together the Fed came out</text>
  <text start="525.1" dur="4.14">today and said we&amp;#39;re going to be raising</text>
  <text start="526.75" dur="6.81">interest rates by 25 basis points this</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="7.95">is the start of the downward Spile</text>
  <text start="533.56" dur="5.19">spiral into the collapse remember going</text>
  <text start="537.19" dur="3.84">back many reports when they raised it</text>
  <text start="538.75" dur="4.14">back in 2015 in December they raised it</text>
  <text start="541.03" dur="5.07">once by 25 basis point that was the</text>
  <text start="542.89" dur="5.19">signal that yes were preparing to go all</text>
  <text start="546.1" dur="3.69">out and bring it down they waited for</text>
  <text start="548.08" dur="3.69">the elections to see who was going to be</text>
  <text start="549.79" dur="3.6">elected because that was going to decide</text>
  <text start="551.77" dur="3.96">how they were going to plan this out</text>
  <text start="553.39" dur="4.53">once they knew Trump was in they raised</text>
  <text start="555.73" dur="3.18">the rates in December of 2016 and they</text>
  <text start="557.92" dur="2.73">made the statement that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="558.91" dur="4.2">be raising at three to four times during</text>
  <text start="560.65" dur="5.25">the year of 2017 and here we are at the</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="5.94">first time since 2006 where they raised</text>
  <text start="565.9" dur="7.41">the rates once again for the third time</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="7.77">now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the Fed</text>
  <text start="573.31" dur="5.4">just raised the rates as the Atlanta Fed</text>
  <text start="576.82" dur="4.639">came out and projected a point nine</text>
  <text start="578.71" dur="5.239">percent gdp growth so we have</text>
  <text start="581.459" dur="4.261">action in retail we see the housing</text>
  <text start="583.949" dur="3.63">market is in a bubble mortgage</text>
  <text start="585.72" dur="4.83">applications are going to decline even</text>
  <text start="587.579" dur="6.57">further we see real wages are dropping</text>
  <text start="590.55" dur="6.839">they&amp;#39;ve just raised the interest rates</text>
  <text start="594.149" dur="5.79">into a weak economy and as we move</text>
  <text start="597.389" dur="4.651">forward into this year most likely they</text>
  <text start="599.939" dur="3.99">will raise it once again and once again</text>
  <text start="602.04" dur="4.919">before the economy starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="603.929" dur="4.77">now the reason they&amp;#39;re doing this very</text>
  <text start="606.959" dur="3.12">very slowly is because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="608.699" dur="5.041">to be blamed for what is about to happen</text>
  <text start="610.079" dur="5.88">so they have to move in slowly and raise</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="4.529">the rates now if we go back in time and</text>
  <text start="615.959" dur="5.49">we look at all the different times they</text>
  <text start="618.269" dur="6.66">raise the rates the economy came down if</text>
  <text start="621.449" dur="7.17">we go back to the recession of 2001 we</text>
  <text start="624.929" dur="7.32">go back to the recession of 2008 we go</text>
  <text start="628.619" dur="7.051">back to before that time period we can</text>
  <text start="632.249" dur="6.421">see that each time the economy came down</text>
  <text start="635.67" dur="5.909">now we need to remember the central bank</text>
  <text start="638.67" dur="5.55">they can bring an economy up they can</text>
  <text start="641.579" dur="5.49">bring the economy down and we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="644.22" dur="4.859">it&amp;#39;s completely evident that they have</text>
  <text start="647.069" dur="4.62">the ability to do this because look in</text>
  <text start="649.079" dur="4.891">2008 when the economy came down they are</text>
  <text start="651.689" dur="4.32">able to pump it up without the people</text>
  <text start="653.97" dur="4.229">buying houses without the people</text>
  <text start="656.009" dur="4.56">shopping in retail buy them just</text>
  <text start="658.199" dur="4.44">creating currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="660.569" dur="4.531">propping up the banks propping up the</text>

  <text start="740.73" dur="5.31">need a scapegoat at this point and they</text>
  <text start="743.52" dur="4.83">have one and most likely when the</text>
  <text start="746.04" dur="6.15">economy is coming down they will be</text>
  <text start="748.35" dur="7.38">blaming probably another group or a</text>
  <text start="752.19" dur="4.86">country where they are cyber attacking</text>

  <text start="798.57" dur="5.61">blaming it on what he&amp;#39;s doing because</text>
