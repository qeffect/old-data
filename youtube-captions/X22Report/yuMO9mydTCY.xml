  <text start="58.879" dur="8.211">friday which they always like to do and</text>
  <text start="62.469" dur="7.51">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the economy is</text>
  <text start="67.09" dur="6.61">completely ripping apart and its</text>
  <text start="69.979" dur="6.301">crumbling and we renting a critical</text>
  <text start="73.7" dur="4.89">stage at this point and when we look at</text>
  <text start="76.28" dur="4.86">the data we are starting to see that</text>
  <text start="78.59" dur="5.809">things are starting to accelerate and</text>
  <text start="81.14" dur="6.36">the central bankers the US government</text>

  <text start="99.799" dur="7.261">bubble at this point is over 1 trillion</text>
  <text start="103.159" dur="6.96">dollars and we can see they are doing</text>
  <text start="107.06" dur="7.83">the same exact tactics as they did with</text>
  <text start="110.119" dur="9.39">the housing loans basically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="114.89" dur="7.95">bundling all of these loans and selling</text>
  <text start="119.509" dur="5.671">them off and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that a</text>

  <text start="132.7" dur="5.46">fourteen percent of those loans were</text>
  <text start="135.769" dur="6.901">made to borrowers with no credit at all</text>
  <text start="138.16" dur="7.54">and what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="145.7" dur="3.99">bubble and right now we do have a</text>
  <text start="147.709" dur="5.28">housing bubble going on right now and it</text>
  <text start="149.69" dur="7.41">is ready to pop and completely implode</text>
  <text start="152.989" dur="6.571">on itself and right now we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="157.1" dur="6.33">this and we see that the auto loan</text>
  <text start="159.56" dur="4.86">industry has been pumped up they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="163.43" dur="3.6">care who they given</text>
  <text start="164.42" dur="5.64">alone too as long as they&amp;#39;re spreading</text>
  <text start="167.03" dur="5.97">the debt lenders now have extended more</text>
  <text start="170.06" dur="6.179">than 110 billion in auto loans to</text>

  <text start="192.8" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;ve done this before to us where</text>
  <text start="195.8" dur="5.28">they tailed us there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no bubble</text>
  <text start="198.11" dur="5.189">the housing industry prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="201.08" dur="5.43">collapse told us there was no such thing</text>
  <text start="203.299" dur="6.811">as a housing bubble and here we are with</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="5.82">an auto loan bubble a derivatives bubble</text>
  <text start="210.11" dur="9.27">a Treasury bond bubble stock market</text>
  <text start="212.33" dur="9.84">bubble housing bubble debt bubble we</text>
  <text start="219.38" dur="5.97">have bubbles all over the place this</text>

  <text start="225.35" dur="5.82">by the central bank that&amp;#39;s it the people</text>
  <text start="227.9" dur="6">are on the sidelines right now now John</text>
  <text start="231.17" dur="6.81">rubino is asking a very important</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="7.44">question here if stocks are continually</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="7.5">rising but corporate sales and profits</text>
  <text start="241.34" dur="7.38">are falling why would companies hire</text>
  <text start="245.48" dur="7.44">more people if they&amp;#39;re selling less</text>
  <text start="248.72" dur="7.739">stuff the answer is that they probably</text>
  <text start="252.92" dur="6.51">wouldn&amp;#39;t business sales and employment</text>
  <text start="256.459" dur="5.191">have tracked closely since the 90s when</text>
  <text start="259.43" dur="3.989">sales have fallen companies have</text>
  <text start="261.65" dur="4.88">responded with less hiring and more</text>
  <text start="263.419" dur="7.171">firing but this is not what we see today</text>
  <text start="266.53" dur="6.19">we actually see the opposite we actually</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="8.54">see corporate profits and sales</text>
  <text start="272.72" dur="10.53">declining and companies are hiring or</text>
  <text start="279.13" dur="8.89">it&amp;#39;s an illusion of hiring because the</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="8.06">unemployment rate is an illusion so are</text>
  <text start="288.02" dur="6.03">they really hiring at this point because</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="6.939">what the government is trying to tell us</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="6.179">is that all these corporations there</text>
  <text start="298.249" dur="4.11">profits and sales are completely</text>
  <text start="300.229" dur="3.72">imploding and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="302.359" dur="4.95">us that all these companies are hiring</text>
  <text start="303.949" dur="5.13">and they have all these job Rex open</text>
  <text start="307.309" dur="5.07">saying yes we want more people to come</text>
  <text start="309.079" dur="6.2">in and I&amp;#39;ve said this before I work for</text>
  <text start="312.379" dur="5.73">a corporation many corporations and</text>
  <text start="315.279" dur="5.85">every time there was some type of hiring</text>
  <text start="318.109" dur="5.55">freeze the hiring freeze was internal</text>
  <text start="321.129" dur="6.37">what they would do is they would keep</text>
  <text start="323.659" dur="5.91">the job Rex open we actually had people</text>
  <text start="327.499" dur="7.14">come in for the interview even though we</text>
  <text start="329.569" dur="6.72">could not give them a job because there</text>
  <text start="334.639" dur="4.26">was a freeze on hiring but they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="336.289" dur="5.01">want to lose the job req so they kept</text>
  <text start="338.899" dur="4.23">this illusion that we were continually</text>
  <text start="341.299" dur="4.34">looking for people and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.129" dur="5.07">happening out in the industry right now</text>
  <text start="345.639" dur="4.54">everything is crashing but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.199" dur="5.28">keeping the illusion alive that people</text>
  <text start="350.179" dur="6.54">are still going to be getting jobs at</text>
  <text start="353.479" dur="5.01">these corporations and we know this is</text>
  <text start="356.719" dur="6.36">furthest from the truth what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.489" dur="11.28">seeing is more and more layoffs and at</text>
  <text start="363.079" dur="11.19">this point manufacturing retail they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="369.769" dur="9.86">going to be letting people go because</text>
  <text start="374.269" dur="5.36">this economy right now is completely</text>
  <text start="380.829" dur="12.25">collapsing the Baltic Dry Index is down</text>
  <text start="385.699" dur="9.86">to 498 down another 6 this is the first</text>
  <text start="393.079" dur="5.04">time this has ever ever happened and</text>
  <text start="395.559" dur="5.1">when we look we see a number of dry bulk</text>
  <text start="398.119" dur="5.1">operators have filed for bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="400.659" dur="5.41">while others have been forced to delist</text>
  <text start="403.219" dur="5.37">from the New York Stock Exchange one of</text>
  <text start="406.069" dur="5.37">the Greek owners of 18 dry bulk ship</text>
  <text start="408.589" dur="4.92">said it&amp;#39;s a bloodbath I&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="411.439" dur="6">business for 25 years and I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="413.509" dur="8.25">seen it this bad and this is the</text>
  <text start="417.439" dur="5.85">recovery people this is the illusionary</text>
  <text start="421.759" dur="5.84">recovery that they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="423.289" dur="8.821">us of now yesterday i mentioned that</text>
  <text start="427.599" dur="7.181">obama&amp;#39;s going to veto the new bill that</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="6.2">Congress is putting together form it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.78" dur="6.3">passed the house and Janet Yellen is</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="4.09">very worried about this she&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="441.08" dur="5.04">writing letters to the Speaker of the</text>
  <text start="442.4" dur="6.03">House Paul Ryan and it is a sign that</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="6.02">the central bank is a little worried</text>
  <text start="448.43" dur="8.48">about what Congress is up to and</text>
  <text start="452.14" dur="8.41">yellen&amp;#39;s letter in particular is</text>
  <text start="456.91" dur="7.15">basically asking Congress what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="6.74">on here why are you moving down this</text>
  <text start="464.06" dur="7.41">path and we have to remember the</text>
  <text start="467.29" dur="6.88">Constitution grants Congress monetary</text>
  <text start="471.47" dur="4.32">powers these include the power to borrow</text>
  <text start="474.17" dur="3.27">money on the credit of the United States</text>
  <text start="475.79" dur="4.83">to coin money and regulate the value</text>
  <text start="477.44" dur="5.46">thereof and to provide for punishment of</text>
  <text start="480.62" dur="4.38">counterfeiting to regulate commerce and</text>
  <text start="482.9" dur="5.75">to fix the standard of weights and</text>
  <text start="485" dur="8.01">measures Congress if they wanted to</text>
  <text start="488.65" dur="9.4">could could dismantle the Fed completely</text>
  <text start="493.01" dur="8.25">and entirely so what are we seeing here</text>
  <text start="498.05" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re nervous because they want more</text>
  <text start="501.26" dur="4.65">transparency into this private</text>
  <text start="502.97" dur="6.09">corporation they want to see what</text>
  <text start="505.91" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re up to why are things going the</text>
  <text start="509.06" dur="5.79">way they&amp;#39;re going now is this going to</text>
  <text start="512.36" dur="5.52">get any further most likely not it will</text>
  <text start="514.85" dur="7.379">hit the President&amp;#39;s desk and it will be</text>
  <text start="517.88" dur="7.86">veto because we know the central bankers</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="8.521">control the executive branch we know</text>
  <text start="525.74" dur="7.71">this is who they report to now the brick</text>
  <text start="530.75" dur="4.65">members they&amp;#39;re going to be using their</text>
  <text start="533.45" dur="3.77">own currencies and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="535.4" dur="4.47">using this in foreign trade payments</text>
  <text start="537.22" dur="4.15">Russia is proposing this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.87" dur="2.97">doing this two completely separate</text>
  <text start="541.37" dur="3.3">themselves from the dollar at this point</text>
  <text start="542.84" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s no reason to even</text>
  <text start="544.67" dur="6.36">use the dollar it makes more sense to</text>
  <text start="547.79" dur="7.37">use their own currencies Europe right</text>
  <text start="551.03" dur="6.33">now after the Paris terrorist attack</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="3.88">they&amp;#39;re going to be looking at getting</text>
  <text start="557.36" dur="3.48">rid of weapons as we know they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="559.04" dur="4.8">going to be looking at getting rid of</text>
  <text start="560.84" dur="4.7">virtual currencies if you notice</text>
  <text start="563.84" dur="5.21">everyone&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="565.54" dur="5.489">what happened in Paris to use it for</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="4.339">their own different agendas the central</text>
  <text start="571.029" dur="4.891">bankers are using it to get rid of all</text>
  <text start="573.389" dur="4.601">virtual type of currencies because this</text>
  <text start="575.92" dur="4.919">is what they&amp;#39;re saying is this is what</text>
  <text start="577.99" dur="5.61">terrorists use they use electronic</text>
  <text start="580.839" dur="5.87">currency to move currency around very</text>
  <text start="583.6" dur="7.32">quickly they&amp;#39;re also trying to ban cash</text>
  <text start="586.709" dur="6.271">now why are they doing this well the</text>
  <text start="590.92" dur="6.659">reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this is because</text>
  <text start="592.98" dur="8.08">basically it is a threat to the euro and</text>
  <text start="597.579" dur="8.43">to the dollar to the central bankers</text>
  <text start="601.06" dur="7.74">currency because bitcoin is one of the</text>
  <text start="606.009" dur="4.801">most common virtual currencies and it is</text>
  <text start="608.8" dur="3.89">used as a vehicle for moving money</text>
  <text start="610.81" dur="5.04">around the world very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="612.69" dur="7.389">anonymously via the web without the need</text>
  <text start="615.85" dur="7.2">of a third party and guess what central</text>
  <text start="620.079" dur="6.69">bankers do not like this they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="623.05" dur="8.31">gold they don&amp;#39;t like electro electronic</text>
  <text start="626.769" dur="9.331">currencies this is a problem for them</text>
  <text start="631.36" dur="8.88">and we realize they don&amp;#39;t like cash</text>
  <text start="636.1" dur="6.14">either much harder to keep track of this</text>
  <text start="640.24" dur="5.49">is why they want everything electronic</text>
  <text start="642.24" dur="5.77">using their system when you go outside</text>
  <text start="645.73" dur="5.549">of their system they have a problem with</text>
  <text start="648.01" dur="7.769">it and this is what bitcoin does this is</text>
  <text start="651.279" dur="6.87">what gold does it goes around their</text>
  <text start="655.779" dur="5.961">system this is why the bricks are saying</text>
  <text start="658.149" dur="6.3">let the nation&amp;#39;s use their own currency</text>
  <text start="661.74" dur="4.93">this is why Russia and trying to decided</text>
  <text start="664.449" dur="4.231">you know what we don&amp;#39;t need to use the</text>
  <text start="666.67" dur="5.789">dollar anymore we&amp;#39;re going to use our</text>
  <text start="668.68" dur="5.759">own currency and as we move forward what</text>
  <text start="672.459" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re going to see is more and more</text>
  <text start="674.439" dur="5.971">countries do this and we will see the</text>
  <text start="676.839" dur="7.5">dollar continually die off as time goes</text>
  <text start="680.41" dur="6.39">on and this is a problem for the central</text>
  <text start="684.339" dur="4.44">bankers listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="686.8" dur="5.45">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
  <text start="688.779" dur="3.471">be prepared thanks a lot</text>
