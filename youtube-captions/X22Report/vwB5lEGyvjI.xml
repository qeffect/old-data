  <text start="48.18" dur="8.699">the economic collapse financial news as</text>
  <text start="50.82" dur="8.879">we approach the end of december we see</text>
  <text start="56.879" dur="5.64">at this point holiday sales are not</text>
  <text start="59.699" dur="5.311">going as planned we know the central</text>
  <text start="62.519" dur="4.941">bankers want us wants everyone to</text>
  <text start="65.01" dur="5.039">believe that this holiday season is</text>
  <text start="67.46" dur="4.9">doing very well the economy has improved</text>
  <text start="70.049" dur="5.731">unemployment is down everything is</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="6.03">perfectly good but out in the UK we are</text>
  <text start="75.78" dur="7.229">seeing that retail sales they have grown</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="7.71">at a very slow pace this is completely</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="4.921">unexpected in december and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="86.1" dur="5.339">saying right now from the CBI group is</text>
  <text start="87.93" dur="6.63">that the outlook for January is not</text>
  <text start="91.439" dur="6.03">strong going forward in 2016 does not</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="5.729">look good and they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="97.469" dur="6.72">hope for sales next month are at their</text>
  <text start="100.289" dur="6.83">lowest since May of 2012 so when we look</text>
  <text start="104.189" dur="7.35">throughout Europe UK Canada Australia</text>
  <text start="107.119" dur="7.661">United States the holiday season is not</text>
  <text start="111.539" dur="6.78">bringing in the revenue not bringing in</text>
  <text start="114.78" dur="8.67">the sales they thought was going to</text>
  <text start="118.319" dur="7.86">happen I mean it makes kind of sense</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="5.4">that all of this is not going the way</text>
  <text start="126.179" dur="7.381">they thought because unemployment GDP</text>
  <text start="128.85" dur="7.41">inflation it&amp;#39;s all manipulated if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="5.37">using manipulated calculations how can</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="4.89">you expect what&amp;#39;s really going on in the</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="6.05">economy to work out it just can&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="6.33">and if all these companies are</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="4.99">continually hiring like the government</text>
  <text start="147.48" dur="4.77">says which we take the opposite approach</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="3.96">where challenger green christmas is</text>
  <text start="152.25" dur="3.09">saying no there are tons and tons of</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="3.889">layoffs we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more</text>
  <text start="155.34" dur="7.64">companies layoffs we would see then</text>
  <text start="157.819" dur="6.891">office space increasing right because if</text>
  <text start="162.98" dur="5.48">corporations are high</text>
  <text start="164.71" dur="7.13">like Obama is telling us we would see</text>
  <text start="168.46" dur="8.46">retail expanding we would see sales</text>
  <text start="171.84" dur="8.05">increasing we would then see people with</text>
  <text start="176.92" dur="5.67">more disposable income people being very</text>
  <text start="179.89" dur="4.95">comfortable in their jobs saving the</text>
  <text start="182.59" dur="4.17">money going out and shopping purchasing</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="5.07">homes we&amp;#39;re not seeing this at all and</text>
  <text start="186.76" dur="6.08">when we look at office space which is</text>
  <text start="189.91" dur="9.9">very interesting it is completely</text>
  <text start="192.84" dur="10.66">declined since the year 2009 we are in a</text>
  <text start="199.81" dur="5.91">steady decline of office space now this</text>
  <text start="203.5" dur="3.72">is kind of strange and I know people who</text>
  <text start="205.72" dur="5.49">said well everyone is telecommuting</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="7.26">today well no they&amp;#39;re not many of the</text>
  <text start="211.21" dur="5.19">corporations right now yes the corporate</text>
  <text start="214.48" dur="4.2">media is telling you this but most of</text>
  <text start="216.4" dur="3.75">the corporations want the people in the</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="3.51">office because they don&amp;#39;t trust them to</text>
  <text start="220.15" dur="4.47">do the work at home if no one&amp;#39;s there</text>
  <text start="222.19" dur="7.61">yes there are a few but the newly</text>
  <text start="224.62" dur="9.54">employed people work in the company and</text>
  <text start="229.8" dur="10.08">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is office</text>
  <text start="234.16" dur="10.64">space is in a complete and utter decline</text>
  <text start="239.88" dur="9.55">now why is this why is everything</text>
  <text start="244.8" dur="8.83">declining in offices if corporations are</text>
  <text start="249.43" dur="7.35">hiring it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re not we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="8.84">seen thousands upon thousands of people</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="8.52">being laid off and what this means is</text>
  <text start="262.47" dur="5.43">that they don&amp;#39;t need the office space</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="6.18">and this is why we see a lot of</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="6.46">corporations getting rid of their</text>
  <text start="271.48" dur="6.48">offices because they don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="274.36" dur="7.95">space anymore for example back in 2013</text>
  <text start="277.96" dur="7.86">2014 going into 2015 the banks like</text>
  <text start="282.31" dur="5.46">citibank Chase Wells Fargo Bank of</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="4.95">America all knew the real estate</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="4.77">industry was not going to be held</text>
  <text start="290.77" dur="2.88">together by the people of the United</text>
  <text start="292.54" dur="3">States they knew they weren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="293.65" dur="4.95">be taking out mortgages they knew this</text>
  <text start="295.54" dur="5.34">was in decline so they got rid of</text>
  <text start="298.6" dur="5.22">the people in their mortgage departments</text>
  <text start="300.88" dur="6.41">and it wasn&amp;#39;t like a hundred or two</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="6.21">hundred it was in the tens of thousands</text>
  <text start="307.29" dur="6.9">so what they did was they reduced their</text>
  <text start="310.03" dur="6.66">office space they didn&amp;#39;t need as much I</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="4.93">remember prior to 2008 when I was</text>
  <text start="316.69" dur="5.85">working for a major corporation the</text>
  <text start="319.12" dur="6.63">floor that I was on was three-quarters</text>
  <text start="322.54" dur="4.68">empty because they were preparing and</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="4.53">getting ready to get rid of the office</text>
  <text start="327.22" dur="8.04">space the same thing is happening right</text>
  <text start="330.28" dur="8.24">now why are the wire wise is happening</text>
  <text start="335.26" dur="7.8">because the entire system is collapsing</text>
  <text start="338.52" dur="7">the fed right now is preparing for this</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="4.37">collapse now we know the fed went out</text>
  <text start="345.52" dur="3.66">and they raised the interest rate and</text>
  <text start="347.43" dur="5.5">everyone&amp;#39;s clapping their hands</text>
  <text start="349.18" dur="6.54">fantastic as a result of the fed&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.93" dur="4.53">balance sheet expanding to four point</text>
  <text start="355.72" dur="5.85">five trillion over the past seven years</text>
  <text start="357.46" dur="7.62">the most direct consequence has been in</text>
  <text start="361.57" dur="7.64">the increase in excess reserves held at</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="8.34">various banks to just over 2.5 trillion</text>
  <text start="369.21" dur="6.69">so this means that cash held by various</text>
  <text start="373.42" dur="5.28">commercial banks has risen</text>
  <text start="375.9" dur="4.6">proportionately there has been a direct</text>
  <text start="378.7" dur="4.23">correlation between the amount of excess</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="5.85">reserves in the system and bank cash</text>
  <text start="382.93" dur="5.13">holdings a whopping 1.15 trillion</text>
  <text start="386.35" dur="5.79">remains parked at foreign banks</text>
  <text start="388.06" dur="8.1">operating in the US so who benefits from</text>
  <text start="392.14" dur="5.84">all this well because the Fed came out</text>
  <text start="396.16" dur="5.31">and said they&amp;#39;re raising interest rates</text>
  <text start="397.98" dur="7.03">we see that the banks are going to</text>
  <text start="401.47" dur="5.22">benefit from this because the banks who</text>
  <text start="405.01" dur="4.53">continue to park their excess reserves</text>
  <text start="406.69" dur="6.54">at the Fed collect a point five percent</text>
  <text start="409.54" dur="6.75">on the cash foreign banks received</text>
  <text start="413.23" dur="5.82">another nine billion in cumulative</text>
  <text start="416.29" dur="4.8">interest payments from the Fed a grand</text>
  <text start="419.05" dur="4.95">total which now amounts to just shy of</text>
  <text start="421.09" dur="5.55">15 billion this means that instead of</text>
  <text start="424" dur="4.56">handing over only six billion in risk</text>
  <text start="426.64" dur="3.96">free interest to foreign banks these</text>
  <text start="428.56" dur="3.96">same foreign banks operating on US</text>
  <text start="430.6" dur="3.93">territory with reserves parked at the</text>
  <text start="432.52" dur="5.01">fed will receive a grand total of eleven</text>
  <text start="434.53" dur="5.069">billion in interest in 2016 closing the</text>
  <text start="437.53" dur="5.75">year with 26 billion in cumulative</text>
  <text start="439.599" dur="6.81">interest receipts from the Fed so banks</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="7.449">are being propped up their balance sheet</text>
  <text start="446.409" dur="10.651">is being propped up just by raising the</text>
  <text start="450.729" dur="8.34">Fed fund rate 2.25 percent and we can</text>
  <text start="457.06" dur="4.41">see right now the Fed has always said</text>
  <text start="459.069" dur="5.491">and they looked at the banks they need</text>
  <text start="461.47" dur="4.89">more reserved in the banks and this is</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="4.53">what&amp;#39;s happening right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.36" dur="9.029">getting prepared to bring the system</text>
  <text start="469.09" dur="10.889">down and at this point if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="475.389" dur="8.28">preparing you need to prepare because as</text>
  <text start="479.979" dur="6.93">we can see from the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="483.669" dur="6.15">this economy is not doing well think</text>
  <text start="486.909" dur="6.48">about the national debt which is</text>
  <text start="489.819" dur="4.951">approaching 19 trillion and that is what</text>
  <text start="493.389" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re reporting to the everyday person</text>
  <text start="494.77" dur="4.199">but with all the other things thrown</text>
  <text start="497.319" dur="5.85">into it it&amp;#39;s around two hundred or so</text>
  <text start="498.969" dur="7.17">trillion and the amount of interest on</text>
  <text start="503.169" dur="7.68">this debt is about 400 billion per year</text>
  <text start="506.139" dur="8.371">and it&amp;#39;s so large that hat it has its</text>
  <text start="510.849" dur="5.25">own category of government spending now</text>
  <text start="514.51" dur="4.709">the government spending for this fiscal</text>
  <text start="516.099" dur="6.391">year will hit four trillion for the</text>
  <text start="519.219" dur="5.761">first time in history they passed a tax</text>
  <text start="522.49" dur="6.98">package which we know that will cut</text>
  <text start="524.98" dur="8.46">government tax revenue by 622 billion</text>
  <text start="529.47" dur="5.41">that sounds great but these tax cuts are</text>
  <text start="533.44" dur="3.75">not going to affect the everyday person</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="5.93">or your personal income taxes most of</text>
  <text start="537.19" dur="6.81">them went to corporations so basically</text>
  <text start="540.81" dur="7.6">they are willfully increasing expenses</text>
  <text start="544" dur="7.74">and decreasing revenue a brilliant move</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="5.6">and just think about how much the</text>
  <text start="551.74" dur="6.3">government is spending at this point and</text>
  <text start="554.01" dur="6.49">how much is actually coming in this</text>
  <text start="558.04" dur="4.68">system right now cannot be sustained and</text>
  <text start="560.5" dur="5.1">as time goes on as more and more people</text>
  <text start="562.72" dur="3.51">are getting laid off more more people go</text>
  <text start="565.6" dur="2.73">from that</text>
  <text start="566.23" dur="4.59">by paying job to that part time job that</text>
  <text start="568.33" dur="7.53">means there&amp;#39;s less revenue coming into</text>
  <text start="570.82" dur="8.34">the government now Puerto Rico they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="575.86" dur="7.95">on the verge of collapsing defaulting on</text>
  <text start="579.16" dur="7.5">their their debt and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="583.81" dur="4.77">Puerto Rico could default before</text>
  <text start="586.66" dur="4.8">Congress returns from their new year</text>
  <text start="588.58" dur="4.92">recess they need to make up about nine</text>
  <text start="591.46" dur="5.4">hundred and fifty seven million of</text>
  <text start="593.5" dur="6.9">interest payments by January first but</text>
  <text start="596.86" dur="6.6">don&amp;#39;t worry Puerto Rico is still paying</text>
  <text start="600.4" dur="7.62">holiday bonuses in the tune of about a</text>
  <text start="603.46" dur="7.88">hundred and twenty million dollars now</text>
  <text start="608.02" dur="7.47">for a Commonwealth that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="611.34" dur="10.33">default maybe they should not be paying</text>
  <text start="615.49" dur="8.58">bonuses at this point but we will wait</text>
  <text start="621.67" dur="5.28">and see what happens we know the</text>
  <text start="624.07" dur="4.29">government is maneuvering and trying to</text>
  <text start="626.95" dur="7.44">figure out ways and changing the</text>
  <text start="628.36" dur="10.89">bankruptcy laws to help Puerto Rico now</text>
  <text start="634.39" dur="11.04">Russia they have bypassed Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="639.25" dur="9.12">in oil production Russia took the top</text>
  <text start="645.43" dur="5.01">spot in May marking the first time in</text>
  <text start="648.37" dur="4.05">history that Moscow beat out Saudi</text>
  <text start="650.44" dur="4.98">Arabia when it comes to crude exports to</text>
  <text start="652.42" dur="5.54">Beijing Russia overtook Saudi Arabia for</text>
  <text start="655.42" dur="6.9">the third time this year in November as</text>
  <text start="657.96" dur="7.66">China&amp;#39;s largest crude oil supplier China</text>
  <text start="662.32" dur="5.43">brought in about 949 thousand barrels</text>
  <text start="665.62" dur="3.96">per day of Russian crude in November</text>
  <text start="667.75" dur="4.14">compared to only eight hundred and</text>
  <text start="669.58" dur="6.71">eighty-six thousand from Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="671.89" dur="7.59">and we can see that china is basically</text>
  <text start="676.29" dur="5.5">dumping Saudi Arabia and going with</text>
  <text start="679.48" dur="4.65">Russia and increasing the amount of oil</text>
  <text start="681.79" dur="4.77">that they&amp;#39;re importing from Russia at</text>
  <text start="684.13" dur="4.26">this point because what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="686.56" dur="4.29">to do is completely get off of the</text>
  <text start="688.39" dur="4.53">private western central bank system we</text>
  <text start="690.85" dur="4.29">see Russia&amp;#39;s doing this we see China is</text>
  <text start="692.92" dur="4.89">doing this we see the central bank right</text>
  <text start="695.14" dur="4.92">now is completely preparing for this</text>
  <text start="697.81" dur="6">collapse to occur</text>
  <text start="700.06" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;ve already given us the signal by</text>
  <text start="703.81" dur="3.72">raising the interest rates they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="706.09" dur="4.62">already telling us they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="707.53" dur="5.22">raising it many times this coming year</text>
  <text start="710.71" dur="5.48">which we know most likely will not</text>
  <text start="712.75" dur="7.56">happen and we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="716.19" dur="6.6">they are trying to push war in all</text>
  <text start="720.31" dur="8.33">different areas to cover up this</text>
  <text start="722.79" dur="10.15">collapse of the system and at this point</text>
  <text start="728.64" dur="6.94">they are running out of time we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="732.94" dur="5.46">already gotten a signal that this system</text>
  <text start="735.58" dur="6.87">is coming down we already know the</text>
  <text start="738.4" dur="5.76">economic indicators do not match what</text>
  <text start="742.45" dur="4.89">the government and the central bank is</text>
  <text start="744.16" dur="7.2">telling us what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="747.34" dur="6.9">manipulating everything in the economy</text>
  <text start="751.36" dur="6.36">just to keep it operational and many</text>
  <text start="754.24" dur="5.88">people today realize how this is done I</text>
  <text start="757.72" dur="3.84">mean with our own finances you know oh I</text>
  <text start="760.12" dur="2.4">won&amp;#39;t pay the electric this month</text>
  <text start="761.56" dur="4.17">because I need the money to pay</text>
  <text start="762.52" dur="5.07">something else oh I can take out more</text>
  <text start="765.73" dur="3.87">money on this credit card to pay this</text>
  <text start="767.59" dur="4.29">and I&amp;#39;ll worry about that later and you</text>
  <text start="769.6" dur="4.2">keep juggling this until you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="771.88" dur="3.36">juggle it anymore this is what the</text>
  <text start="773.8" dur="2.94">government is doing right now this is</text>
  <text start="775.24" dur="4.11">what the central bank is doing right now</text>
  <text start="776.74" dur="4.29">yes they can create money but eventually</text>
  <text start="779.35" dur="4.74">what happens just like credit cards</text>
