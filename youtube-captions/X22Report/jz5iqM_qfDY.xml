  <text start="84.8" dur="6.15">bit after a huge increase and most</text>
  <text start="88.91" dur="4.62">likely we might even see gold move up</text>
  <text start="90.95" dur="5.22">even more so but we have to watch</text>
  <text start="93.53" dur="5.78">essential bankers because they&amp;#39;re tricky</text>
  <text start="96.17" dur="6.179">they like to suppress gold quite a bit</text>

  <text start="106.429" dur="8.131">move up quite a bit and suppression gets</text>
  <text start="110.569" dur="6.66">harder and harder to do we will realize</text>
  <text start="114.56" dur="6.479">we will understand that the central</text>
  <text start="117.229" dur="6.931">bankers have lost control and this time</text>
  <text start="121.039" dur="5.61">I don&amp;#39;t believe is very far off because</text>
  <text start="124.16" dur="6.829">when we look at what is going around</text>
  <text start="126.649" dur="9.06">going on around the world we are seeing</text>
  <text start="130.989" dur="7.021">the bubbles start to pop now we talked</text>
  <text start="135.709" dur="5.661">about the Vancouver housing bubble and</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="6.97">it is deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="141.37" dur="5.68">the official data came out and right now</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="5.55">the Vancouver housing bubble it is</text>
  <text start="147.05" dur="6.51">bursting and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="150.53" dur="5.97">is sales have fallen by twenty six</text>
  <text start="153.56" dur="4.62">percent from a year earlier and tumbled</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="6.99">by twenty three percent compared to July</text>
  <text start="158.18" dur="6.15">and we can see that there is a real</text>
  <text start="163.49" dur="3.33">shift</text>
  <text start="164.33" dur="5.99">in the real estate market in Vancouver</text>
  <text start="166.82" dur="5.91">even bloomberg is reporting this and</text>
  <text start="170.32" dur="7.63">when we look at Canada&amp;#39;s consumer</text>
  <text start="172.73" dur="8.16">confidence index it is declining for the</text>
  <text start="177.95" dur="6.81">second week in a row according to the</text>
  <text start="180.89" dur="5.61">BBG nanos telephone pole what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="4.89">seeing right now is local real estate</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="5.06">prices they are falling and they have</text>
  <text start="189.65" dur="5.88">almost doubled in the last two weeks and</text>
  <text start="191.56" dur="6.1">the pole is showing that people are no</text>
  <text start="195.53" dur="6.72">longer confident in the real estate</text>
  <text start="197.66" dur="10.89">market and the confidence index is down</text>
  <text start="202.25" dur="9.78">from 59.9 it is down to 58.4 we see the</text>
  <text start="208.55" dur="8.25">British Columbia expectation sub-index</text>
  <text start="212.03" dur="8.27">is also declining and it&amp;#39;s dropping very</text>
  <text start="216.8" dur="8.43">quickly it was around 70 it is now at</text>
  <text start="220.3" dur="6.909">60.9 and this is going to spread around</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="4.229">the world we&amp;#39;re already seeing it here</text>
  <text start="227.209" dur="4.711">in the US we&amp;#39;re getting signs of this in</text>
  <text start="229.459" dur="5.341">Australia UK we&amp;#39;re getting signed to</text>
  <text start="231.92" dur="6.69">this and throughout Europe and just like</text>
  <text start="234.8" dur="5.79">in 2008 this is going to spread rapidly</text>
  <text start="238.61" dur="2.629">because when people see prices coming</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="2.64">down you have to remember</text>
  <text start="241.239" dur="5.201">psychologically when people see prices</text>
  <text start="243.23" dur="5.52">coming down they think to in they think</text>
  <text start="246.44" dur="6.78">there&amp;#39;s something&amp;#39;s wrong with the</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="7.17">economy I&amp;#39;m losing my wealth of course</text>
  <text start="253.22" dur="6.44">it&amp;#39;s all on paper but this is the</text>
  <text start="255.92" dur="6.27">mentality and it&amp;#39;s already starting and</text>
  <text start="259.66" dur="5.259">it&amp;#39;s going to accelerate as we go on</text>
  <text start="262.19" dur="4.47">because we&amp;#39;re coming out of the prime</text>
  <text start="264.919" dur="4.621">real estate months and we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="266.66" dur="6.78">into the fall into the winter and it is</text>
  <text start="269.54" dur="6.2">going to be absolutely horrific and real</text>
  <text start="273.44" dur="6.03">estate is going to completely fall apart</text>
  <text start="275.74" dur="6.25">now we see the jolt survey was released</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="4.47">and they reported that in July the</text>
  <text start="281.99" dur="5.73">number of job openings rebounded from</text>
  <text start="283.94" dur="7.729">the June drop and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="287.72" dur="7.17">right now is the corporate media</text>
  <text start="291.669" dur="6.251">continually tells us there&amp;#39;s all these</text>
  <text start="294.89" dur="6.57">job openings and we just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="297.92" dur="5.19">people to fill these jobs that&amp;#39;s our</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="4.2">biggest problem it sounds like the real</text>
  <text start="303.11" dur="5.58">estate market where they say we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="305.66" dur="5.73">have the inventory to give to the people</text>
  <text start="308.69" dur="5.61">who want to buy actually do you know</text>
  <text start="311.39" dur="5.94">they said this back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="5.61">eight right before everything completely</text>
  <text start="317.33" dur="4.05">fell apart during that year the reason</text>
  <text start="319.91" dur="4.5">why housing was slowing down is because</text>
  <text start="321.38" dur="5.27">the inventory is drying up that wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="324.41" dur="4.8">the reason prices were coming down</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="5.95">people were losing confidence people</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="5.82">were losing jobs people were abandoning</text>
  <text start="332.6" dur="4.89">their houses taemin&amp;#39;s warm being made on</text>
  <text start="335.03" dur="3.99">the mortgage but they&amp;#39;d like to use</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="4.83">these type of excuses now you have to</text>
  <text start="339.02" dur="8.07">remember these job openings that a</text>
  <text start="342.32" dur="6.24">company puts out there Rex inside the</text>
  <text start="347.09" dur="3.33">company in each department has a certain</text>
  <text start="348.56" dur="5.19">number of wrecks now departments don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="350.42" dur="6.78">like to lose their job Rex so what they</text>
  <text start="353.75" dur="7.14">do is they put out these job wrecks and</text>
  <text start="357.2" dur="5.52">they say listen interview people try to</text>
  <text start="360.89" dur="6.99">look for people fit with these specific</text>
  <text start="362.72" dur="6.78">skills and make it very very specific so</text>
  <text start="367.88" dur="3.03">we can ever find anyone but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="369.5" dur="4.38">tell them that but that&amp;#39;s the real</text>
  <text start="370.91" dur="5.46">reason and if you do find someone well</text>
  <text start="373.88" dur="4.95">tell them that we&amp;#39;re thinking about it</text>
  <text start="376.37" dur="6.12">and we can&amp;#39;t really give them job right</text>
  <text start="378.83" dur="4.83">now and this is what&amp;#39;s going on through</text>
  <text start="382.49" dur="3.84">the major corporations think about</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="5.22">corporations are laying off individuals</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="5.4">corporations their sales are down</text>
  <text start="388.88" dur="6.48">revenue is down stock market is</text>
  <text start="391.73" dur="5.01">completely fake phony and false so do</text>
  <text start="395.36" dur="4.56">you really think there&amp;#39;s that many job</text>
  <text start="396.74" dur="4.62">openings out there no I remember when</text>
  <text start="399.92" dur="5.12">there was a hiring freeze in the company</text>
  <text start="401.36" dur="8.43">that I used to work for and they told us</text>
  <text start="405.04" dur="8.41">specifically continually continue to</text>
  <text start="409.79" dur="6.45">interview the people but we can&amp;#39;t give a</text>
  <text start="413.45" dur="4.56">job right now but you need to interview</text>
  <text start="416.24" dur="5.07">you need to bring them back one two</text>
  <text start="418.01" dur="4.65">three times but we never offered anyone</text>
  <text start="421.31" dur="3.45">anyone because it was a hiring freeze</text>
  <text start="422.66" dur="6.44">but they didn&amp;#39;t want to say they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="424.76" dur="6.51">need these job Rex so they need to show</text>
  <text start="429.1" dur="2.74">corporate the middle management the</text>
  <text start="431.27" dur="1.77">upper middle</text>
  <text start="431.84" dur="4.53">management that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="433.04" dur="6.81">interviewing people it&amp;#39;s a game that</text>
  <text start="436.37" dur="9.84">they play and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="439.85" dur="9.44">now is that all of this is one giant</text>
  <text start="446.21" dur="7.64">illusion to convince the public that</text>
  <text start="449.29" dur="8.349">everything is fine but we are worse than</text>
  <text start="453.85" dur="8.25">where the Great Depression was one in</text>
  <text start="457.639" dur="7.111">six prime aged men they have no job</text>
  <text start="462.1" dur="4.75">millions of men in their prime working</text>
  <text start="464.75" dur="6.479">years they&amp;#39;ve completely dropped out of</text>
  <text start="466.85" dur="7.289">the workforce and they tried to look for</text>
  <text start="471.229" dur="5.791">a job they put resumes out there looking</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="6.151">for a job but there are no jobs to be</text>
  <text start="477.02" dur="4.89">found and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="4.8">eighty-three percent of men in the prime</text>
  <text start="481.91" dur="8.039">working ages of 25 to 54 they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="9.079">not in the labor force that&amp;#39;s 10 million</text>
  <text start="489.949" dur="6.451">men that are missing from the workforce</text>
  <text start="494.169" dur="4.781">putting that number into contacts in the</text>
  <text start="496.4" dur="4.88">1960s nearly one hundred percent of men</text>
  <text start="498.95" dur="6.45">between the ages of 25 and 50 for worked</text>
  <text start="501.28" dur="7.42">that&amp;#39;s fallen over the decades one in</text>
  <text start="505.4" dur="7.17">six prime age guys that have no job</text>
  <text start="508.7" dur="10.829">right now is worse than the depression</text>
  <text start="512.57" dur="8.909">in the 30s so we&amp;#39;re basically in the</text>
  <text start="519.529" dur="4.861">depression right now if you really think</text>
  <text start="521.479" dur="6.571">about it The Situation&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="524.39" dur="6">and worse as we move along here we see</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="4.53">in August the class 8 net orders for</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="4.71">trucking they&amp;#39;re down over twenty five</text>
  <text start="532.58" dur="4.83">percent compared to last year in fact</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="6.14">the level of trailing 12-month net</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="9.96">orders is the lowest since january of</text>
  <text start="541.24" dur="12.13">2011 this is 18 consecutive months in</text>
  <text start="547.37" dur="9.12">the negative territory again we have a</text>
  <text start="553.37" dur="5.7">major problem and we know there are</text>
  <text start="556.49" dur="4.14">bubbles all over the place where</text>
  <text start="559.07" dur="3.96">derivative bubble we have stock market</text>
  <text start="560.63" dur="4.11">bubble we have a Treasury bond bubble we</text>
  <text start="563.03" dur="6.69">have a auto loan bubble student</text>
  <text start="564.74" dur="8.64">loan bubble a debt bubble and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="569.72" dur="5.85">seeing right now is a repeat of 2008 but</text>
  <text start="573.38" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s happening in the subprime auto loan</text>
  <text start="575.57" dur="6.81">market as we know auto lenders they</text>
  <text start="579.74" dur="5.64">become very aggressive they&amp;#39;re allowed</text>
  <text start="582.38" dur="5.25">to give loans out to the subprime people</text>
  <text start="585.38" dur="5.04">if you have a heartbeat we will give you</text>
  <text start="587.63" dur="6.12">a loan sounds like 2008 with the</text>
  <text start="590.42" dur="5.22">subprime mortgage crisis and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="593.75" dur="3.72">seeing right now is that these</text>
  <text start="595.64" dur="3.11">individuals who are getting these cars</text>
  <text start="597.47" dur="3.9">because you can walk into a dealership</text>
  <text start="598.75" dur="4.51">you can say oh I want that car the least</text>
  <text start="601.37" dur="3.69">prices whatever it is 399 or if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="603.26" dur="4.199">financing it might be a little bit more</text>
  <text start="605.06" dur="4.62">you can put zero percent down and walk</text>
  <text start="607.459" dur="6.031">out with a car without taking any money</text>
  <text start="609.68" dur="6.8">out of your pocket but we can see right</text>
  <text start="613.49" dur="7.11">now delinquency rates are now</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="5.65">double-digit percentages and major auto</text>
  <text start="620.6" dur="6.45">lenders are bracing for hundreds of</text>
  <text start="622.13" dur="7.05">millions of dollars of losses so what</text>
  <text start="627.05" dur="7.409">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="629.18" dur="11.219">delinquency rates they have increased in</text>
  <text start="634.459" dur="10.411">the second quarter and individuals who</text>

  <text start="756.48" dur="5.549">the central bankers they&amp;#39;ve painted</text>
  <text start="757.74" dur="8.19">themselves into a corner they&amp;#39;re stuck</text>
  <text start="762.029" dur="7.101">right now yes they might come out with</text>
  <text start="765.93" dur="7.23">other ways of manipulating the system</text>
  <text start="769.13" dur="7.449">but we can see when we look at 2008</text>
  <text start="773.16" dur="5.669">there comes a certain point where the</text>
  <text start="776.579" dur="5.671">manipulation does end think about it</text>
  <text start="778.829" dur="5.641">with the subprime securities crisis they</text>
  <text start="782.25" dur="3.48">kept them at triple-a more and more</text>
  <text start="784.47" dur="4.229">people defaulting remember the people</text>
  <text start="785.73" dur="6.349">that is the part they can&amp;#39;t control they</text>
  <text start="788.699" dur="6.991">like to control it but they can&amp;#39;t and as</text>
  <text start="792.079" dur="5.82">more and more people you know become</text>
  <text start="795.69" dur="6.079">delinquent and auto loans housing loans</text>
  <text start="797.899" dur="6.011">student loans this is the major problem</text>
  <text start="801.769" dur="4.81">now they could have kept those subprime</text>
  <text start="803.91" dur="5.1">securities at triple-a pretended that</text>
  <text start="806.579" dur="3.87">everything was fine but what happened</text>
  <text start="809.01" dur="4.17">was lenders were going out of business</text>
  <text start="810.449" dur="4.801">they couldn&amp;#39;t stop it and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="813.18" dur="4.29">happening right now they can manipulate</text>
  <text start="815.25" dur="6.17">further but it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="817.47" dur="6.75">difficult to stop the entire system</text>
  <text start="821.42" dur="5.08">imploding when it starts to unravel they</text>
  <text start="824.22" dur="4.859">just won&amp;#39;t be able to do it and it looks</text>
  <text start="826.5" dur="5.46">like we are coming to that point now I</text>
  <text start="829.079" dur="4.831">did want to mention one thing here</text>
  <text start="831.96" dur="4.86">between Trump and Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="833.91" dur="5.64">again I am NOT for either of these</text>
  <text start="836.82" dur="4.65">candidates I believe is the shadow</text>
  <text start="839.55" dur="6.17">government the central bankers are in</text>
  <text start="841.47" dur="6.3">power these individuals are just puppets</text>
  <text start="845.72" dur="4.21">until they get rid of the shadow</text>
  <text start="847.77" dur="6.51">government but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="849.93" dur="10.5">from Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s statement where</text>
  <text start="854.28" dur="8.9">she told Trump that he was not allowed</text>
  <text start="860.43" dur="6.66">to mention the Federal Reserve as a</text>
  <text start="863.18" dur="8.01">president or as someone who is running</text>
  <text start="867.09" dur="9.33">for the Presidency and from this comment</text>
  <text start="871.19" dur="7.81">that shows you who is really in control</text>
  <text start="876.42" dur="5.4">now of course she made up the argument</text>
  <text start="879" dur="4.41">that it could spook the markets it could</text>
  <text start="881.82" dur="4.11">you know words have meaning and she went</text>
  <text start="883.41" dur="5.64">on and on and on but when you look at</text>
  <text start="885.93" dur="5.64">this you can see where she&amp;#39;s getting her</text>
  <text start="889.05" dur="5.42">orders from it is the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="891.57" dur="5.25">they are the ones who are in control</text>
  <text start="894.47" dur="5.32">they&amp;#39;re the ones who are calling the</text>
  <text start="896.82" dur="6.51">shots and until we remove the central</text>
  <text start="899.79" dur="6.54">bank the president is meaningless</text>
  <text start="903.33" dur="4.62">because once that individual gets in</text>
  <text start="906.33" dur="3.99">that doesn&amp;#39;t go along with the Federal</text>
  <text start="907.95" dur="5.28">Reserve what do you think they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="910.32" dur="5.67">to do with that person they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="913.23" dur="6.33">try to get rid of that person or they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="915.99" dur="5.7">try not to let that person in by doing</text>
  <text start="919.56" dur="5.64">something else maybe have some type of</text>
  <text start="921.69" dur="6.84">an event but we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="925.2" dur="6.27">central bank that is our big problem</text>
  <text start="928.53" dur="4.77">here remove the central bank remove the</text>
  <text start="931.47" dur="7.02">shadow government remove those</text>
  <text start="933.3" dur="7.53">individuals and then we can start fresh</text>
  <text start="938.49" dur="4.23">listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="940.83" dur="5.36">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
  <text start="942.72" dur="3.47">be prepared thanks a lot</text>
