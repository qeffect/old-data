  <text start="162.4" dur="6.809">around 16,000 Bitcoin and 16,000 Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="166.569" dur="5.131">cash to two separate wallets and it</text>
  <text start="169.209" dur="4.681">looks like they might be getting ready</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="5.009">to dump this again and if we go back in</text>
  <text start="173.89" dur="6.3">time we can see that every time they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="176.709" dur="5.881">dropped Bitcoin if we go back to</text>
  <text start="180.19" dur="4.47">December they dropped around 2000 and</text>

  <text start="195.43" dur="5.79">bitcoins and they&amp;#39;re getting ready to do</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="4.71">this again with 16,000 bitcoins and this</text>
  <text start="201.22" dur="3.84">is going to bring the price down once</text>
  <text start="202.66" dur="3.96">again and again the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="3.149">gonna go on there and say this is very</text>
  <text start="206.62" dur="3.869">volatile you don&amp;#39;t want to be in this</text>
  <text start="208.209" dur="3.181">and it looks like this is being done on</text>
  <text start="210.489" dur="4.11">purpose</text>
  <text start="211.39" dur="4.56">now once again the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="214.599" dur="3.571">want everyone away from crypto</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="3.509">currencies they&amp;#39;re very very afraid of</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="3.599">cryptocurrency because of a lot of</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="5.551">people start to understand what it is</text>
  <text start="221.769" dur="5.731">and how it works they would realize that</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="4.5">we do need the central banking system</text>
  <text start="227.5" dur="5.4">the centralized system it&amp;#39;s obsolete</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="6.559">today decentralization that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="6.27">coming decentralized exchanges</text>
  <text start="236.069" dur="5.801">decentralized currency there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="239.17" dur="6.23">no entity that fully controls it and</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="6">this is what they&amp;#39;re most afraid of and</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="4.66">again we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="3.959">volatility as we move forward and you</text>
  <text start="250.06" dur="3.179">want to get around this I think the days</text>
  <text start="251.829" dur="4.231">of just holding it and hoping that</text>
  <text start="253.239" dur="5.49">everything works out is over for right</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="5.94">now it might happen where it might come</text>
  <text start="258.729" dur="5.221">back into play later on but for now you</text>
  <text start="262" dur="5.69">need to know how to maneuver around this</text>
  <text start="263.95" dur="6.089">and how to make sure that you keep your</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="5.229">profits make sure that you know how to</text>
  <text start="270.039" dur="5.071">profit from this and there are ways to</text>
  <text start="272.919" dur="5.131">do this you can watch crypto Z crypto</text>

  <text start="342.59" dur="5.759">this if you join now as we can see the</text>
  <text start="345.38" dur="4.289">economy is completely breaking down and</text>
  <text start="348.349" dur="2.761">the dollar is dying this is why the</text>
  <text start="349.669" dur="4.921">central bankers are so worried about</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="6.21">other currencies like gold silver</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="5.4">cryptocurrency they don&amp;#39;t like anything</text>
  <text start="357.32" dur="4.379">competing with their system they hate it</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="4.32">they can&amp;#39;t stand it and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.699" dur="4.261">seeing as as the dollar declines and</text>
  <text start="364.31" dur="4.229">continually declines where it&amp;#39;s losing</text>
  <text start="365.96" dur="4.56">its value well it&amp;#39;s making it harder and</text>
  <text start="368.539" dur="4.38">harder for people to get by and we could</text>
  <text start="370.52" dur="4.8">see right now for the twenty six month</text>
  <text start="372.919" dur="5.521">in a row us spending growth outpaced</text>
  <text start="375.32" dur="4.62">income growth january was revised down</text>
  <text start="378.44" dur="3.78">from three point two percent three</text>
  <text start="379.94" dur="5.19">percent February&amp;#39;s down from three point</text>
  <text start="382.22" dur="4.53">four percent of 3.3% and now March at</text>
  <text start="385.13" dur="3.93">just three point one percent we see</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="4.62">personal savings well that is going</text>
  <text start="389.06" dur="4.229">absolutely nowhere it is declining once</text>
  <text start="391.37" dur="5.549">again people are having a very rough</text>
  <text start="393.289" dur="5.581">time saving but they are spending using</text>
  <text start="396.919" dur="4.141">their credit cards because again the</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="4.26">everyday person they don&amp;#39;t have the high</text>
  <text start="401.06" dur="5.28">paying job they have the part-time job</text>
  <text start="403.13" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re losing jobs and the system is</text>
  <text start="406.34" dur="5.579">not doing as well as everyone wants</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="6.24">everyone to think it is now again</text>
  <text start="411.919" dur="5.701">nothing has changed since 2008 the</text>
  <text start="415.82" dur="4.26">central banker has pumped everything up</text>
  <text start="417.62" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ve government the Fed they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="420.08" dur="4.559">manipulating all the calculations with</text>
  <text start="422.09" dur="4.47">GDP inflation unemployment and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.639" dur="4.59">making it seem like everything is</text>
  <text start="426.56" dur="6.18">absolutely fine actually everyone felt</text>
  <text start="429.229" dur="5.521">the same exact way right before the 2008</text>
  <text start="432.74" dur="4.709">crash everyone said oh everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="5.52">great we love States fantastic we see</text>
  <text start="437.449" dur="5.731">jobs are fantastic the stock market&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="440.27" dur="4.28">14,000 points everything looks great and</text>
  <text start="443.18" dur="4.14">then all of a sudden snap of a finger</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="4.75">everything came crashing down we see</text>
  <text start="447.32" dur="4.23">pending home sales right now they have</text>
  <text start="449.3" dur="5.37">declined for the fourth</text>
  <text start="451.55" dur="5.49">straight month in a row and they rose</text>
  <text start="454.67" dur="5.22">about 0.4% month and month missing</text>
  <text start="457.04" dur="5.22">expectations of about 0.7% month and</text>
  <text start="459.89" dur="4.17">month and we could see right now that</text>
  <text start="462.26" dur="3.6">when we look at this on a year-to-year</text>
  <text start="464.06" dur="5.43">basis we see pending home sales they</text>
  <text start="465.86" dur="8.22">drop by 4.4 percent that is quite a bit</text>
  <text start="469.49" dur="7.8">and we know that the central banks the</text>
  <text start="474.08" dur="6.66">banking system they realize they need to</text>
  <text start="477.29" dur="6.45">keep the system prompt up get as many</text>
  <text start="480.74" dur="5.88">people as in as they possibly can before</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="4.92">they bring it down now again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.62" dur="3.54">trying to control the narrative just</text>
  <text start="488.66" dur="3.9">like Trump is trying to control the</text>
  <text start="490.16" dur="4.26">narrative and both of them are going to</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="3.66">be fighting for this but they like a lot</text>
  <text start="494.42" dur="4.77">of people into the system they like a</text>
  <text start="496.22" dur="5.19">lot of people into the stock market they</text>
  <text start="499.19" dur="4.38">like they like to loan out a lot of</text>
  <text start="501.41" dur="3.96">money to bring all these people in so</text>
  <text start="503.57" dur="4.38">they combine all the toxic real estate</text>
  <text start="505.37" dur="4.32">on pennies on the dollar and again they</text>
  <text start="507.95" dur="4.32">buy pennies on the dollar then they</text>
  <text start="509.69" dur="4.41">unwind and sell it for a profit I mean</text>
  <text start="512.27" dur="3.6">think about how this is all being played</text>
  <text start="514.1" dur="3.6">out here they&amp;#39;ve done it in the past</text>
  <text start="515.87" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re going to try to do it once again</text>
  <text start="517.7" dur="5.16">now back in 2015</text>
  <text start="519.62" dur="6.23">Freddie Mac rolled out a conventional</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="6.96">mortgage that only required 3% down and</text>
  <text start="525.85" dur="7">that program didn&amp;#39;t do as well as they</text>
  <text start="529.82" dur="5.55">thought it was going to do it did allow</text>
  <text start="532.85" dur="4.35">people to come into the market but what</text>
  <text start="535.37" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;ve done is they&amp;#39;ve taken it to the</text>
  <text start="537.2" dur="5.4">next step now Freddie Mac which and they</text>
  <text start="540.53" dur="4.98">announced this last Thursday that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.6" dur="6.66">going to supercharge its 3% down program</text>
  <text start="545.51" dur="5.76">and launch a widespread expansion of the</text>
  <text start="549.26" dur="4.5">offering and what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="551.27" dur="4.94">are going to be doing the 3% down but</text>
  <text start="553.76" dur="5.55">there&amp;#39;s going to be no income check</text>
  <text start="556.21" dur="5.29">whatsoever in other words they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="559.31" dur="5.37">to bring everyone into the system and</text>
  <text start="561.5" dur="6.3">they need the American person they need</text>
  <text start="564.68" dur="5.43">that person to purchase the homes who is</text>
  <text start="567.8" dur="5.07">holding the homes right now foreign</text>
  <text start="570.11" dur="5.82">investors hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="5.94">companies they held the houses to pump</text>
  <text start="575.93" dur="6.6">the bubbles up what do they do in the</text>
  <text start="578.81" dur="6.63">end game the end stage of this bubble</text>
  <text start="582.53" dur="5.01">cycle they need to unload just like the</text>
  <text start="585.44" dur="4.32">stock market you have all those people</text>
  <text start="587.54" dur="3.33">in there pumping it all up and then but</text>
  <text start="589.76" dur="3.24">then you reach a certain point before</text>
  <text start="590.87" dur="4.11">the bubble pops they need to unload it</text>
  <text start="593" dur="3.93">and they may need to make everyone feel</text>
  <text start="594.98" dur="3.96">and this is the small investor that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="596.93" dur="3.3">gonna continually move up and up and up</text>
  <text start="598.94" dur="3.9">the same thing with the real estate</text>
  <text start="600.23" dur="5.43">market they are ready to unload so what</text>
  <text start="602.84" dur="4.32">they do is they try to get everyone into</text>
  <text start="605.66" dur="4.14">the system and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="607.16" dur="5.46">right now they&amp;#39;re bringing everyone into</text>
  <text start="609.8" dur="5.04">the system because they know that these</text>
  <text start="612.62" dur="4.08">bubbles they are popping we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="614.84" dur="5.49">talking about what is happening out in</text>
  <text start="616.7" dur="6.15">Canada Australia New York California and</text>
  <text start="620.33" dur="4.35">many of the other areas remember all</text>
  <text start="622.85" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re doing is pumping up 20 different</text>
  <text start="624.68" dur="4.83">cities to make you think that it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="627.05" dur="5.07">entire country but it isn&amp;#39;t the entire</text>

  <text start="803.93" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for years they</text>
  <text start="806.48" dur="6.12">moved all the manufacturing over to the</text>
  <text start="809.87" dur="4.71">east it took many many years to do that</text>
  <text start="812.6" dur="4.53">but look what they&amp;#39;ve done they moved</text>
  <text start="814.58" dur="5.88">everything all out to China to other</text>
  <text start="817.13" dur="5.52">countries in Asia they created the</text>
  <text start="820.46" dur="5.73">payment system they created the</text>
  <text start="822.65" dur="6.21">exchanges they created the gold exchange</text>
  <text start="826.19" dur="5.25">they created the petro yuyuan they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="828.86" dur="4.89">been buying gold at this very very low</text>
  <text start="831.44" dur="4.83">price they&amp;#39;ve been making bilateral</text>
  <text start="833.75" dur="4.41">trades over the years they didn&amp;#39;t start</text>
  <text start="836.27" dur="4.56">yesterday making these bilateral trades</text>
  <text start="838.16" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;ve been doing it they started their</text>
  <text start="840.83" dur="4.95">one belt one road they had like 70</text>
  <text start="843.17" dur="6.69">countries signed on to this this has</text>
  <text start="845.78" dur="6.36">been planned a long time ago and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="849.86" dur="4.44">at the stage right now where the</text>
  <text start="852.14" dur="5.04">almost ready to flip the switch and move</text>
  <text start="854.3" dur="5.099">everything over to the new system this</text>
  <text start="857.18" dur="4.469">is going to change the way we see</text>
  <text start="859.399" dur="4.081">everything today because the United</text>
  <text start="861.649" dur="3.721">States will no longer be the reserve</text>
  <text start="863.48" dur="4.02">currency once the United States is no</text>
  <text start="865.37" dur="4.95">longer the reserve currency well guess</text>
  <text start="867.5" dur="4.89">what our way our lives well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="870.32" dur="4.38">gonna change a little bit because we</text>
  <text start="872.39" dur="5.04">won&amp;#39;t have the dominance of the dollar</text>
  <text start="874.7" dur="5.34">another country will and that means</text>
  <text start="877.43" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to change with it and</text>
  <text start="880.04" dur="5.549">the way we run our lives just like other</text>
  <text start="883.19" dur="3.81">countries had to change when they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="885.589" dur="4.68">because when they lost their reserve</text>
  <text start="887" dur="5.31">status but this is much larger and I</text>
  <text start="890.269" dur="4.201">don&amp;#39;t know if people are gonna be ready</text>
  <text start="892.31" dur="5.399">for this because it&amp;#39;s gonna be painful</text>
  <text start="894.47" dur="4.92">in the beginning yes over time it will</text>
  <text start="897.709" dur="3.721">smooth out but in the very beginning</text>
  <text start="899.39" dur="3.74">just like when we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="901.43" dur="5.31">standard went on to the petrodollar in</text>
  <text start="903.13" dur="4.69">1970s 1971 it was painful in the</text>
  <text start="906.74" dur="3.839">beginning and we were the reserve</text>
  <text start="907.82" dur="5.43">currency at that time now the reserve</text>
  <text start="910.579" dur="4.95">currency is moving away from the US so</text>
  <text start="913.25" dur="5.13">this is going to be painful and once</text>
  <text start="915.529" dur="5.971">again once this happens everything is</text>
  <text start="918.38" dur="5.28">going to be repriced and the dollar</text>
  <text start="921.5" dur="4.529">might not exist they might have to</text>
  <text start="923.66" dur="5.369">change things up actually the dollar</text>
  <text start="926.029" dur="5.641">probably won&amp;#39;t exists and this is why we</text>
  <text start="929.029" dur="4.68">see the crypto market coming into play</text>
  <text start="931.67" dur="4.83">this is why the central bankers don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="933.709" dur="4.591">like this and what we need to do once we</text>
  <text start="936.5" dur="3.39">start moving through this transition we</text>
  <text start="938.3" dur="3.12">need to say that we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="939.89" dur="3.78">central bank&amp;#39;s anymore we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="941.42" dur="5.31">private western central banks we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="943.67" dur="5.34">need them to create our currency we</text>
  <text start="946.73" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t need a centralized system anymore</text>
  <text start="949.01" dur="4.41">we need a decentralized system just like</text>
  <text start="951.14" dur="4.62">we don&amp;#39;t need a global a system which is</text>
  <text start="953.42" dur="5.97">really a centralized system we need a</text>
  <text start="955.76" dur="6.75">national system we need a decentralized</text>
  <text start="959.39" dur="4.47">system to move forward so it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="962.51" dur="3.42">be bumpy we&amp;#39;re gonna go through this</text>
  <text start="963.86" dur="4.02">transition and this is why you need to</text>
  <text start="965.93" dur="3.39">protect your wealth with gold and silver</text>
  <text start="967.88" dur="3.569">make sure you also have crypto</text>
  <text start="969.32" dur="3.9">currencies because most likely this will</text>
  <text start="971.449" dur="4.471">be the currency that we&amp;#39;ll be using to</text>
  <text start="973.22" dur="4.92">transact business because it&amp;#39;ll be very</text>
  <text start="975.92" dur="5.669">easy it&amp;#39;s all electronic everyone has a</text>
  <text start="978.14" dur="6.36">phone it&amp;#39;s easy to send and receive and</text>

  <text start="984.5" dur="3.63">people this is what</text>
  <text start="985.67" dur="4.05">be using gold and silver very important</text>

  <text start="993.2" dur="6.21">you still have gold and silver gold and</text>
  <text start="996.02" dur="7.4">silver maintains its value over time and</text>
