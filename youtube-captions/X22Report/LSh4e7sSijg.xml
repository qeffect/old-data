  <text start="167.05" dur="4.719">they&amp;#39;ll feel it</text>
  <text start="168.68" dur="5.27">first during the beginning stages and</text>

  <text start="186.769" dur="2.761">off the</text>
  <text start="187.28" dur="5.58">and when you start to look at this you</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="8.49">can see that this whole entire system</text>
  <text start="192.86" dur="8.85">has not allowed the younger generation</text>
  <text start="198.02" dur="6.15">to make it think about it go back to the</text>
  <text start="201.71" dur="4.41">70s where people were getting raises you</text>
  <text start="204.17" dur="3.66">saw inflation this was the beginning of</text>
  <text start="206.12" dur="2.55">the central banking system everyone</text>
  <text start="207.83" dur="4.62">thought it was great</text>

  <text start="212.45" dur="6.75">went up by double everything was going</text>
  <text start="215.3" dur="6">up today everything is happening in the</text>
  <text start="219.2" dur="5.58">opposite way why because we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="221.3" dur="6.6">end of the cycle that&amp;#39;s the whole point</text>
  <text start="224.78" dur="5.4">of this the central bank system has the</text>
  <text start="227.9" dur="4.83">beginning a middle and an end</text>
  <text start="230.18" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;ve gone through the beginning in the</text>
  <text start="232.73" dur="6.33">middle we&amp;#39;re at the end cycle there will</text>
  <text start="235.88" dur="5.15">be no more boom and bust there&amp;#39;ll only</text>
  <text start="239.06" dur="4.56">be a bust</text>
  <text start="241.03" dur="4.6">they&amp;#39;ve already made sure of this they</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="3.3">already knew that this was going to be</text>
  <text start="245.63" dur="5.28">the end this is why they started</text>
  <text start="246.92" dur="7.71">printing like crazy yes I know pushing a</text>
  <text start="250.91" dur="6.75">button this is what they do at the end</text>
  <text start="254.63" dur="5.669">stage look at all the central banks go</text>
  <text start="257.66" dur="4.5">back in history and just watch what</text>
  <text start="260.299" dur="3.391">they&amp;#39;ve done back then of course they</text>
  <text start="262.16" dur="4.74">take they&amp;#39;ve taken it now to the ninth</text>
  <text start="263.69" dur="7.62">degree and they&amp;#39;re trying to keep the</text>
  <text start="266.9" dur="5.94">system alive now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="271.31" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re supposed to be in the in this</text>
  <text start="272.84" dur="3.18">incredible recovery the central bank has</text>
  <text start="275.45" dur="2.64">cured</text>
  <text start="276.02" dur="4.5">pretty much everything corporations are</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="4.38">saying everything is great but of course</text>
  <text start="280.52" dur="4.649">when we look through all the garbage and</text>
  <text start="282.47" dur="4.65">all the fake manipulated numbers they</text>
  <text start="285.169" dur="4.411">throw us we can see that everything is</text>
  <text start="287.12" dur="6.63">not that great what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="289.58" dur="8.13">is that chapter 11 bankruptcy z&amp;#39; they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.75" dur="5.729">up by 63 percent from a year ago now</text>
  <text start="297.71" dur="5.61">think about this for a second we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="299.479" dur="6.811">this recovery and all of a sudden we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="5.01">having these bankruptcies now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="306.29" dur="6.15">just the brick and mortar meltdown</text>
  <text start="308.33" dur="6.69">anymore it&amp;#39;s spreading new chapter 11</text>
  <text start="312.44" dur="6.03">bankruptcy in the US they spiked 63</text>
  <text start="315.02" dur="5.669">percent year-over-year in March to 770</text>
  <text start="318.47" dur="6.259">filings the highest number of</text>
  <text start="320.689" dur="8.91">filings for any month since April 2011</text>
  <text start="324.729" dur="7.631">where there had been 789 filings now</text>
  <text start="329.599" dur="6.511">when we look at this data from the</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="6.089">American bankruptcy Institute we can see</text>
  <text start="336.11" dur="5.309">that the year-over-year jump of 219 and</text>
  <text start="338.449" dur="5.82">filing filings in March is the second</text>
  <text start="341.419" dur="6.39">largest year-over-year jump for any</text>
  <text start="344.269" dur="7.14">month since the Great Recession it is</text>
  <text start="347.809" dur="6.301">behind only the jump of 366 filings last</text>
  <text start="351.409" dur="7.26">December which had a set which had set a</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="6.929">post recession record now bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="358.669" dur="4.56">filings they are seasonal and they</text>
  <text start="361.039" dur="5.58">usually peak around April along with</text>
  <text start="363.229" dur="7.04">taxis and so the March jump it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="366.619" dur="7.2">look really that great for April and</text>
  <text start="370.269" dur="6.94">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.819" dur="4.98">not improving everything is actually</text>
  <text start="377.209" dur="3.3">getting worse and it&amp;#39;s not just the</text>
  <text start="378.799" dur="4.08">brick-and-mortar now if we go back in</text>
  <text start="380.509" dur="6.48">time between late 2015</text>
  <text start="382.879" dur="9.08">going into late 2016 we had the oil bust</text>
  <text start="386.989" dur="8.46">chapter 11 bankruptcy z&amp;#39; from late 2017</text>
  <text start="391.959" dur="6.13">to the present we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="395.449" dur="6.11">brick-and-mortar and corporate</text>
  <text start="398.089" dur="9.18">bankruptcies that are continually rising</text>
  <text start="401.559" dur="8.38">this tells us that we are headed to a</text>
  <text start="407.269" dur="4.38">complete and utter disaster because if</text>
  <text start="409.939" dur="4.58">we go back in time and we look what</text>
  <text start="411.649" dur="5.67">happened during the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="414.519" dur="5.35">during that period we see this these</text>
  <text start="417.319" dur="4.62">same exact signs now in Manhattan we</text>
  <text start="419.869" dur="6.39">talked about the commercial real estate</text>
  <text start="421.939" dur="6.69">for retail where that is imploding there</text>
  <text start="426.259" dur="5.101">was you know strips where there were no</text>
  <text start="428.629" dur="6.05">stores whatsoever Manhattan home sales</text>
  <text start="431.36" dur="6.539">right now they fell the most since 2009</text>
  <text start="434.679" dur="5.83">condos coops they fell by 25% in the</text>
  <text start="437.899" dur="6.36">first quarter of 2018 compared to the</text>
  <text start="440.509" dur="8.64">first quarter of 2017 and we know that</text>
  <text start="444.259" dur="9.03">it this is not from the tax related bill</text>
  <text start="449.149" dur="5.131">that Trump put forth because in 2017 we</text>
  <text start="453.289" dur="5.191">saw sale</text>
  <text start="454.28" dur="6.45">volume drop which then means that if</text>
  <text start="458.48" dur="6.12">that is falling</text>
  <text start="460.73" dur="6.06">it means the sales in 2018 are not going</text>
  <text start="464.6" dur="5.37">to be there this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="466.79" dur="5.06">taxes whatsoever so when we start to</text>
  <text start="469.97" dur="4.98">look at the economy we can see that</text>
  <text start="471.85" dur="5.05">everything I mean I mean think about the</text>
  <text start="474.95" dur="4.37">number of indicators that we have been</text>
  <text start="476.9" dur="5.28">looking at think about the number of</text>
  <text start="479.32" dur="5.53">different economic sectors we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="482.18" dur="6.84">looking at and each one is declining</text>
  <text start="484.85" dur="9.48">right now even the global debt has hit a</text>
  <text start="489.02" dur="9.81">record of 237 trillion it&amp;#39;s up 21</text>
  <text start="494.33" dur="9.21">trillion in 2017 I mean think about this</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="8.31">for a second we&amp;#39;re at a point where this</text>
  <text start="503.54" dur="5.64">system is going to basically come to a</text>
  <text start="507.14" dur="8.1">screeching halt and it&amp;#39;s just going to</text>
  <text start="509.18" dur="8.64">implode the global GDP is over three</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="5.76">hundred and twenty seven percent now</text>
  <text start="517.82" dur="8.28">according to the latest quarterly update</text>
  <text start="521" dur="7.65">the iif has calculated the global debt</text>
  <text start="526.1" dur="7.47">rose another four trillion in the past</text>
  <text start="528.65" dur="9">quarter to a record 237 trillion like we</text>
  <text start="533.57" dur="6.39">just mentioned and more than 70 trillion</text>
  <text start="537.65" dur="7.02">higher from a decade earlier and up</text>
  <text start="539.96" dur="8.34">roughly 20 trillion in 2017 alone the</text>
  <text start="544.67" dur="7.65">central bankers they understand that</text>
  <text start="548.3" dur="5.46">they can&amp;#39;t put on any more debt even</text>
  <text start="552.32" dur="6.18">here in the United States they can</text>
  <text start="553.76" dur="8.34">contain every country starts to buckle</text>
  <text start="558.5" dur="6.96">under this debt and the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.1" dur="6.42">well they start to have problems they</text>
  <text start="565.46" dur="5.52">have to put austerity on the people and</text>
  <text start="568.52" dur="5.31">that means they have to cut certain</text>
  <text start="570.98" dur="4.65">programs that means jobs disappear</text>
  <text start="573.83" dur="3.87">which means people aren&amp;#39;t bringing an</text>
  <text start="575.63" dur="4.23">income if they&amp;#39;re not bringing an income</text>
  <text start="577.7" dur="4.889">they can&amp;#39;t pay taxes if they don&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="579.86" dur="5.04">taxes you can&amp;#39;t pay down the debt this</text>
  <text start="582.589" dur="4.381">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing in Greece this is</text>
  <text start="584.9" dur="3.32">what we&amp;#39;re seeing in France this is what</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="2.75">we&amp;#39;re seeing in if</text>
  <text start="588.22" dur="2.46">we&amp;#39;re seeing it all over the place where</text>
  <text start="589.72" dur="3.39">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing in the United</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="5.13">States this is why the tax receipts are</text>
  <text start="593.11" dur="5.159">continually declining because as you</text>
  <text start="595.81" dur="4.829">move forward even if people get jobs</text>
  <text start="598.269" dur="5.611">there are low-paying jobs and you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="600.639" dur="6.63">bringing in the same tax base so this</text>
  <text start="603.88" dur="6.389">system is buckling under from all of</text>
  <text start="607.269" dur="4.62">this debt and it&amp;#39;s getting worse as time</text>
  <text start="610.269" dur="3.69">goes on and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="611.889" dur="4.44">happen they will not be able to stop the</text>
  <text start="613.959" dur="3.601">avalanche of the entire system coming</text>
  <text start="616.329" dur="3.091">down now the central bankers know this</text>

  <text start="733.84" dur="3.75">their Treasuries and it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="736.03" dur="2.37">sense for them to purchase any more at</text>
  <text start="737.59" dur="3.75">this point in time</text>
  <text start="738.4" dur="4.11">Russia is considering dropping the</text>
  <text start="741.34" dur="5.13">dollar which they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="742.51" dur="5.88">eventually and the Euro and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="787.8" dur="5.5">well we don&amp;#39;t want to use the dollar</text>
  <text start="790.75" dur="6.39">most likely that will go to Russia or</text>
