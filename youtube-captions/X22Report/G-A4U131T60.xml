  <text start="60.05" dur="3.689">episode is a conflict between the elite</text>
  <text start="62.18" dur="5.13">and Trump is like a ticking time bomb</text>
  <text start="63.739" dur="6.061">ready to go off let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="67.31" dur="6.09">economic collapse political ng of</text>
  <text start="69.8" dur="6.81">political news now we know Obama during</text>
  <text start="73.4" dur="6.39">his term he led in millions of illegal</text>
  <text start="76.61" dur="4.05">aliens without vetting without knowing</text>
  <text start="79.79" dur="3.42">who they really are</text>
  <text start="80.66" dur="6.06">were they criminals did they belong to</text>
  <text start="83.21" dur="6.36">the cartel were they terrorists they had</text>
  <text start="86.72" dur="4.08">he had no clue he just gave him working</text>
  <text start="89.57" dur="3.57">papers and sent him off</text>
  <text start="90.8" dur="4.319">put him in a car and put him in two</text>
  <text start="93.14" dur="5.729">different cities called sanctuary cities</text>
  <text start="95.119" dur="7.381">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="98.869" dur="7.14">Trump he is ordering the Department of</text>
  <text start="102.5" dur="7.2">Homeland Security to publish lists of</text>
  <text start="106.009" dur="6.561">crimes committed by illegals in these</text>
  <text start="109.7" dur="6.87">different sanctuary cities to find out</text>
  <text start="112.57" dur="7.839">where they are who they are and start to</text>
  <text start="116.57" dur="7.589">prepare records of are these criminals</text>
  <text start="120.409" dur="6.6">are they helping our society or do we</text>
  <text start="124.159" dur="5.3">just get criminals coming in from other</text>
  <text start="127.009" dur="4.681">countries entering to this country and</text>
  <text start="129.459" dur="5.231">this looks like it&amp;#39;s going to be going</text>
  <text start="131.69" dur="5.549">towards his merit program of illegals</text>
  <text start="134.69" dur="5.01">can you contribute something to the</text>
  <text start="137.239" dur="5.011">United States if you can&amp;#39;t we need to</text>
  <text start="139.7" dur="4.89">send you back and looks like he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="142.25" dur="5.22">to weed out those criminals from those</text>
  <text start="144.59" dur="5.64">people who will try to improve their</text>
  <text start="147.47" dur="5.19">lives and actually give back to the</text>
  <text start="150.23" dur="5.61">United States so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="152.66" dur="4.98">this goes and see if DHS actually</text>
  <text start="155.84" dur="3.63">follows his orders because you know</text>
  <text start="157.64" dur="3.659">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that there is some</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="4.35">backlash in some of these agencies and</text>
  <text start="161.299" dur="6.841">we know that Trump wants to build this</text>
  <text start="163.82" dur="7.199">wall he campaigned about building a wall</text>
  <text start="168.14" dur="4.62">between the United States and Mexico and</text>
  <text start="171.019" dur="3.151">he said Mexico is going to pay for it he</text>
  <text start="172.76" dur="3.569">kept on saying it that&amp;#39;s what he said</text>
  <text start="174.17" dur="4.89">and the people would not have to pay for</text>
  <text start="176.329" dur="5.071">it at all well we come to find out that</text>
  <text start="179.06" dur="3.16">Mexico well they don&amp;#39;t want to pay for</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="2.47">it</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="3.99">I know he was going to try to do</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="4.59">something with NAFTA using the</text>
  <text start="186.21" dur="4.59">negotiation trying to force Mexico into</text>
  <text start="188.46" dur="5.58">payment with these renegotiations of</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="4.98">trade but it looks like Mexico saying we</text>
  <text start="194.04" dur="2.81">don&amp;#39;t really care we&amp;#39;re not paying for</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="4.53">it whatsoever</text>
  <text start="196.85" dur="6.73">so now Trump is proposing a 20% border</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="5.13">tax to pay for the wall now it sounds</text>
  <text start="203.58" dur="5.22">good but we have to remember there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="5.79">lot of US companies in Mexico and all</text>
  <text start="208.8" dur="4.17">those products that come from that area</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="3.51">to here well it&amp;#39;s going to cost a lot</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="4.56">more money so this really looks like a</text>
  <text start="214.74" dur="3.81">hidden tax on the people and it looks</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="7.07">like the people are going to end up</text>
  <text start="218.55" dur="9.39">paying for it because the 20% border tax</text>
  <text start="224.6" dur="5.29">the companies they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="227.94" dur="4.35">paying for that it&amp;#39;s the people because</text>
  <text start="229.89" dur="6">the cost of the products are going to be</text>
  <text start="232.29" dur="9.6">much much higher so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="8.79">right now is that this wall really</text>
  <text start="241.89" dur="4.53">shouldn&amp;#39;t be built at this time again I</text>
  <text start="244.68" dur="5.1">said it yesterday I said it the day</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="6.03">before when he needs to do is when these</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="8.31">individuals come over legally send them</text>
  <text start="252.45" dur="7.409">back hire more border agents put up</text>
  <text start="258.09" dur="5.25">surveillance it&amp;#39;s a lot cheaper than</text>
  <text start="259.859" dur="7.981">building a physical wall and it can be</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="7.65">done very easily I mean we have the</text>
  <text start="267.84" dur="5.67">technology of drones that can stay up in</text>
  <text start="270.99" dur="7.04">the air for quite a bit run on solar</text>
  <text start="273.51" dur="6.69">power and it is possible to have</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="4.99">surveillance in these areas a lot</text>
  <text start="280.2" dur="4.89">cheaper too but if we just do the</text>
  <text start="283.02" dur="5.01">opposite of what Obama did we wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="5.55">have 2.9 million illegals in the country</text>
  <text start="288.03" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s that simple and we see that Trump</text>
  <text start="290.64" dur="5.279">right now he&amp;#39;s making good on his</text>
  <text start="293.46" dur="4.769">campaign pledge to Bob to block federal</text>
  <text start="295.919" dur="4.531">funding to states and cities where local</text>
  <text start="298.229" dur="5.071">law enforcement refused to report</text>
  <text start="300.45" dur="5.79">undocumented immigrants now remember</text>
  <text start="303.3" dur="6.84">under Obama they didn&amp;#39;t have to report</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="6.56">any of this now under Trump he wants</text>
  <text start="310.14" dur="4.279">them to report if they do not</text>
  <text start="312.8" dur="4.589">they&amp;#39;re not going to get the federal</text>
  <text start="314.419" dur="5.97">funds to their cities and we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="317.389" dur="4.68">seeing that miami-dade county is saying</text>
  <text start="320.389" dur="5.37">that they are going to terminate</text>
  <text start="322.069" dur="6.57">sanctuary status and there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="325.759" dur="6.391">cities that do get quite a bit of</text>
  <text start="328.639" dur="7.291">federal funds New York Chicago Los</text>
  <text start="332.15" dur="8.97">Angeles Philadelphia and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="335.93" dur="7.519">see how they react now we see the media</text>
  <text start="341.12" dur="5.97">the corporate media is out there and</text>
  <text start="343.449" dur="7.9">they are pushing the idea that Trump</text>
  <text start="347.09" dur="7.919">told the USDA to shut up he was placing</text>
  <text start="351.349" dur="7.771">a gag order on the federal scientists</text>
  <text start="355.009" dur="7.011">and it turns out that this whole thing</text>
  <text start="359.12" dur="5.25">is completely fake because Trump is</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="5.019">administration I&amp;#39;m saying that this</text>
  <text start="364.37" dur="3.96">didn&amp;#39;t happen the same the Trump</text>
  <text start="367.039" dur="3.451">administration had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="6.869">the memo to the USDA Agricultural</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="6.66">Research Service&amp;#39;s ARS officials</text>
  <text start="375.199" dur="5.101">released a short memo in advance of the</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="6.54">USDA USDA wide memo with the same</text>
  <text start="380.3" dur="6.78">provision included in a January 2009</text>
  <text start="383.69" dur="4.89">memo from Tom Vilsack after he was</text>

  <text start="388.58" dur="6.69">under President Obama now ARS chief of</text>
  <text start="392.27" dur="6.119">staff Sharon drum however used the wrong</text>
  <text start="395.27" dur="7.619">phrase to describe standard operating</text>
  <text start="398.389" dur="6.75">practices at USDA said ARS communication</text>
  <text start="402.889" dur="5.941">chief Christopher Bentley drum wrote</text>
  <text start="405.139" dur="10.56">that AR ARS will not release any public</text>
  <text start="408.83" dur="9.929">facing documents well this got the ARS</text>
  <text start="415.699" dur="7.44">personnel worried so they leak the memo</text>
  <text start="418.759" dur="6.871">to the media BuzzFeed reported that the</text>
  <text start="423.139" dur="4.741">USDA banned scientists and other</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="4.83">employees in its main research division</text>
  <text start="427.88" dur="4.74">from publicly sharing everything from</text>
  <text start="430.46" dur="6.509">the summaries of scientific papers to</text>
  <text start="432.62" dur="7.979">USDA branded tweets and this is how this</text>
  <text start="436.969" dur="7.021">all got out of hand and this did not</text>
  <text start="440.599" dur="5.69">come from the Trump administration now</text>
  <text start="443.99" dur="4.789">chief strategist of the u.s. press</text>
  <text start="446.289" dur="5.63">Trump Steve Bannon we used to work for</text>

  <text start="455.589" dur="4.44">Trump&amp;#39;s campaign according to ban and</text>
  <text start="458.349" dur="4.29">mainstream media are disconnected from</text>
  <text start="460.029" dur="4.32">everyday Americans which is completely</text>
  <text start="462.639" dur="4.381">obvious because we can see they got the</text>
  <text start="464.349" dur="4.68">entire election completely wrong and we</text>
  <text start="467.02" dur="5.699">can see that they&amp;#39;re losing ratings</text>
  <text start="469.029" dur="6.75">every single day and he&amp;#39;s saying quote</text>
  <text start="472.719" dur="5.4">the media here is the opposition party</text>
  <text start="475.779" dur="4.081">they don&amp;#39;t understand this country they</text>
  <text start="478.119" dur="4.17">still do not understand why Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="5.07">is the President of the United States he</text>
  <text start="482.289" dur="4.62">said the media should be embarrassed and</text>
  <text start="484.93" dur="5.459">humiliated and keep its mouth shut and</text>
  <text start="486.909" dur="6.68">just listen for a while and he added</text>
  <text start="490.389" dur="6.39">that he wants a newspaper to quote this</text>
  <text start="493.589" dur="4.711">he said the elite media got it wrong 100</text>
  <text start="496.779" dur="3.331">percent dead wrong</text>
  <text start="498.3" dur="3.819">commenting on the media&amp;#39;s coverage of</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="4.709">the election calling it a humiliating</text>
  <text start="502.119" dur="8.371">defeat that they will never wash away</text>
  <text start="504.819" dur="8.88">that will always be there so we can see</text>
  <text start="510.49" dur="8.159">right now he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="513.699" dur="7.71">opposition media the elite media they</text>
  <text start="518.649" dur="5.851">lost touch completely of what the people</text>
  <text start="521.409" dur="4.91">want not really surprising because they</text>
  <text start="524.5" dur="5.49">don&amp;#39;t care what the people really want</text>
  <text start="526.319" dur="6.161">they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda and it has</text>
  <text start="529.99" dur="6.02">nothing to do with the people so what</text>
  <text start="532.48" dur="7.2">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that chief</text>
  <text start="536.01" dur="6.28">strategist Bannon is saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="4.61">going after the corporate media he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="4.89">going to set them straight</text>
  <text start="544.29" dur="6.419">he says the media has zero integrity</text>
  <text start="547.18" dur="6.269">zero intelligence and no hard work</text>
  <text start="550.709" dur="7.24">because look at what they&amp;#39;re putting out</text>
  <text start="553.449" dur="8.58">fake news over and over and over now a</text>
  <text start="557.949" dur="7.64">grad student exposed a massive network</text>
  <text start="562.029" dur="6.961">of over 350,000 fake Twitter accounts</text>
  <text start="565.589" dur="7.75">which allowed whoever was controlling</text>
  <text start="568.99" dur="8.26">these accounts to boost interest in</text>
  <text start="573.339" dur="7.241">trending topics they were able to move</text>
  <text start="577.25" dur="8.25">the narrative in any direction they</text>
  <text start="580.58" dur="8.85">wanted and most of it was happening here</text>
  <text start="585.5" dur="7.47">in the United States so when we look at</text>
  <text start="589.43" dur="8.34">this we could say well what group would</text>
  <text start="592.97" dur="8.16">want to do this and most likely it had</text>
  <text start="597.77" dur="9.33">something to do with the CIA because</text>
  <text start="601.13" dur="10.92">they&amp;#39;re able to coordinate these this</text>
  <text start="607.1" dur="7.59">network of 350,000 BOTS to change the</text>
  <text start="612.05" dur="6.63">narrative and change the trending topic</text>
  <text start="614.69" dur="6.63">to what they wanted so they were really</text>
  <text start="618.68" dur="3.96">controlling the news and if you notice</text>
  <text start="621.32" dur="5.28">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do of</text>
  <text start="622.64" dur="6.18">course this failed and this is why they</text>
  <text start="626.6" dur="5.7">went off on fake news where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="628.82" dur="7.11">setting up these fake news fact-checking</text>
  <text start="632.3" dur="5.61">detectors and they&amp;#39;re continually trying</text>
  <text start="635.93" dur="4.08">anything they possibly can to change the</text>
  <text start="637.91" dur="3.81">narrative of the story they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="640.01" dur="3.99">people to hear the truth and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="641.72" dur="4.68">lot of truth coming out and a lot of</text>
  <text start="644" dur="5.01">people can&amp;#39;t handle it in the beginning</text>
  <text start="646.4" dur="6.03">they say it&amp;#39;s not the truth in the</text>
  <text start="649.01" dur="5.4">beginning they say it can&amp;#39;t be they they</text>
  <text start="652.43" dur="4.02">completely reject the truth we went over</text>
  <text start="654.41" dur="4.53">this in another report how it has to</text>
  <text start="656.45" dur="4.41">happen and then finally they accept it</text>
  <text start="658.94" dur="4.38">but right now they&amp;#39;re in the rejection</text>
  <text start="660.86" dur="5.97">phase and they don&amp;#39;t want to hear</text>
  <text start="663.32" dur="6.56">anything else we see Robert Kennedy he</text>
  <text start="666.83" dur="6.9">exposed the CDC as a cesspool of</text>
  <text start="669.88" dur="7.03">corruption and he found out many</text>

  <text start="1098.48" dur="6.42">seeing right now is this is what the</text>
  <text start="1102.35" dur="5.28">elite always wanted this is coming from</text>
  <text start="1104.9" dur="5.52">the Brooke Brookings Institute where</text>
  <text start="1107.63" dur="4.2">they laid out the plan on how to capture</text>

  <text start="1111.83" dur="7.74">create these no-fly zone safe zones the</text>
  <text start="1115.399" dur="6.081">question is if this is signed how is the</text>
  <text start="1119.57" dur="4.229">u.s. going to establish a safe zone</text>
  <text start="1121.48" dur="4.75">because this would mean a no-fly zone</text>
  <text start="1123.799" dur="5.041">and remember terrorists they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1126.23" dur="5.01">planes so why do you need to know fly</text>
  <text start="1128.84" dur="4.679">zone it makes no sense actually Joint</text>

  <text start="1133.519" dur="4.321">Dunford said a no-fly zone in Syria</text>

  <text start="1137.84" dur="5.189">he&amp;#39;s absolutely right</text>
  <text start="1139.34" dur="5.85">and remember Syria has not invited the</text>

  <text start="1145.19" dur="8.19">United States invaded Syria Syria does</text>

  <text start="1170.6" dur="4.14">all terrorist groups of the United</text>
  <text start="1172.1" dur="5.78">States supports and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1174.74" dur="5.34">right now is that if this does happen</text>
  <text start="1177.88" dur="4.6">this could lead to war because this is</text>
  <text start="1180.08" dur="4.949">exactly what the elite want now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1182.48" dur="6.48">hoping that he doesn&amp;#39;t sign this because</text>
  <text start="1185.029" dur="7.5">this would be a complete disaster now in</text>

  <text start="1192.529" dur="7.5">new constitution it was revealed and</text>
  <text start="1197.019" dur="7.241">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that this new</text>
  <text start="1200.029" dur="9.27">proposal means that Syria is going to be</text>
  <text start="1204.26" dur="9.12">a democratic secular decentralized and</text>
  <text start="1209.299" dur="9.87">civic state and what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1213.38" dur="7.71">is as follows the name of the country</text>
  <text start="1219.169" dur="4.651">itself would no longer be the Arab</text>

  <text start="1224.63" dur="4.529">this would go some way towards appeasing</text>

  <text start="1240.19" dur="5.65">they&amp;#39;re also going to separate Syria and</text>

  <text start="1248.6" dur="4.8">would still be part of Syria but they</text>
  <text start="1250.909" dur="5.4">could act independently on their own in</text>
  <text start="1253.4" dur="6.54">that area and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1256.309" dur="5.73">this really doesn&amp;#39;t differ from the 2012</text>
