  <text start="398.69" dur="4.89">this on Syria because they need to get</text>
  <text start="401" dur="7.139">us into award this is a</text>
  <text start="403.58" dur="7.709">a a way to provoke them and to get them</text>
  <text start="408.139" dur="9.391">to do something against either Israel or</text>
  <text start="411.289" dur="8.94">the US and I wonder I mean there was</text>
  <text start="417.53" dur="4.949">really the reports that came out about</text>
  <text start="420.229" dur="5.581">how the internet went down in Syria it</text>
  <text start="422.479" dur="5.731">just something doesn&amp;#39;t smell right there</text>

  <text start="428.21" dur="4.56">to do some cyber attacks I mean was that</text>
  <text start="429.949" dur="5.731">a test was that something like let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="432.77" dur="5.369">if we can bring that down and now we can</text>
  <text start="435.68" dur="5.43">go ahead and we gained access into their</text>
  <text start="438.139" dur="5.101">system I mean think about it it was just</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="4.559">a couple weeks ago that happened and now</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="5.459">all of a sudden we want to do a cyber</text>
  <text start="445.669" dur="6.12">attack against Syria to provoke them</text>

  <text start="459.11" dur="5.79">the inside out now and these these are</text>
  <text start="463.189" dur="3.69">the things that we need to be watching</text>
  <text start="464.9" dur="3.419">because I believe something will be</text>
  <text start="466.879" dur="5.79">happening there and something will be</text>
  <text start="468.319" dur="7.47">happening here now Israel is reporting</text>
  <text start="472.669" dur="7.231">that Syria is attacking their water</text>
  <text start="475.789" dur="5.791">system and the chairman of the natural</text>

  <text start="484.729" dur="4.65">exchange under go hundreds of cyber</text>
  <text start="487.039" dur="4.291">attacks every minute so they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="489.379" dur="4.771">the same things here and if you notice</text>
  <text start="491.33" dur="6.36">all these countries use the same thing</text>
  <text start="494.15" dur="6.329">that water electric the infrastructure</text>
  <text start="497.69" dur="7.319">is being targeted so we are going to see</text>
  <text start="500.479" dur="8.671">something very very big soon I mean</text>
  <text start="505.009" dur="6.87">Israel is setting this up so they can</text>
  <text start="509.15" dur="4.799">start a war they&amp;#39;re going to have a</text>

  <text start="521.87" dur="3.69">going to start now that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="4.62">that they won&amp;#39;t try other things first</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="3.57">to see if they can do it without doing</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="6.51">the main cyber attack but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="529.13" dur="8.399">building this up as their last event to</text>
  <text start="534.56" dur="5.399">really bring it home so we do have</text>
  <text start="537.529" dur="4.47">other false flags potential false flags</text>
  <text start="539.959" dur="9.271">i should say coming up in the near</text>
  <text start="541.999" dur="10.02">future we have the one in New York with</text>
  <text start="549.23" dur="9.979">the chemical drill Israel has a chemical</text>

  <text start="565.069" dur="6">50 states to march with loaded weapons</text>
  <text start="567.85" dur="7.12">on their capitals and I believe this is</text>
  <text start="571.069" dur="6.57">a potential false flag this way it</text>
  <text start="574.97" dur="4.14">happens all across the country and I</text>
  <text start="577.639" dur="4.62">said they were going to be an event</text>
  <text start="579.11" dur="5.039">about gun control and it this really</text>
  <text start="582.259" dur="4.8">looks like it&amp;#39;s fitting into this</text>
  <text start="584.149" dur="5.13">because all they need to do is plant</text>
  <text start="587.059" dur="4.95">some agents or people into these marches</text>
  <text start="589.279" dur="7.23">have them start shooting and the</text>
  <text start="592.009" dur="8.52">government the military which just</text>
  <text start="596.509" dur="5.671">declared that the the pentacon can send</text>

  <text start="613.459" dur="5.61">can see how this is all fitting in</text>
  <text start="615.649" dur="5.55">together and how this is not going to be</text>
  <text start="619.069" dur="5.31">a good situation because these</text>
  <text start="621.199" dur="5.07">infiltrators into these into the groups</text>

  <text start="1400.61" dur="6.33">for this collapse now I wanted to point</text>
  <text start="1403.25" dur="5.94">out one thing I because of the Fed and</text>
  <text start="1406.94" dur="5.64">what&amp;#39;s going on and everyone&amp;#39;s expecting</text>

  <text start="1419.03" dur="4.59">think it&amp;#39;s going to be the full collapse</text>
  <text start="1420.65" dur="4.98">first I think it&amp;#39;s going to be a shock</text>
  <text start="1423.62" dur="4.98">to everyone and the market is going to</text>
  <text start="1425.63" dur="5.46">go down like 800 to twelve to fourteen</text>
  <text start="1428.6" dur="7.02">hundred points and it&amp;#39;s going to wake a</text>
  <text start="1431.09" dur="6.51">lot of people up and those you know who</text>
  <text start="1435.62" dur="4.14">are the elite are going to make a</text>
  <text start="1437.6" dur="4.11">fortune off of shorting the market</text>
  <text start="1439.76" dur="4.05">because they know when it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1441.71" dur="4.23">happen and I believe it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1443.81" dur="3.87">happen in stages like boom it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1445.94" dur="4.26">come down because if you look back in</text>
  <text start="1447.68" dur="5.49">two thousand eight the market came down</text>
  <text start="1450.2" dur="8.04">it went up a little bit people will</text>
  <text start="1453.17" dur="5.97">shocked people made fortunes and I think</text>
  <text start="1458.24" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re going to see that in</text>
  <text start="1459.14" dur="5.43">august-september and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="1462.35" dur="5.16">going to lose their wealth and this will</text>
  <text start="1464.57" dur="6.69">allow them to put even more laws in</text>
  <text start="1467.51" dur="4.15">place for the next big big collapse that</text>
  <text start="1471.26" dur="3.01">will</text>
  <text start="1471.66" dur="4.41">in about four or five months right after</text>
  <text start="1474.27" dur="4.56">that that&amp;#39;s when the big one so this</text>
  <text start="1476.07" dur="5.7">will allow them to implement a lot more</text>
  <text start="1478.83" dur="5.22">laws to do the balance and things like</text>
  <text start="1481.77" dur="5.99">that because we need this to save it now</text>
  <text start="1484.05" dur="9.6">it wasn&amp;#39;t a total collapse it was a</text>
  <text start="1487.76" dur="7.69">short you know flash collapse like like</text>
  <text start="1493.65" dur="4.17">we saw in 2008 where they need the</text>
  <text start="1495.45" dur="3.84">bailouts and I believe they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1497.82" dur="4.04">do the same thing because if you look at</text>
