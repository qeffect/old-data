  <text start="89.39" dur="6.6">carrying Republicans off to a retreat</text>
  <text start="93.38" dur="6.299">and it&amp;#39;s just very interesting that this</text>
  <text start="95.99" dur="5.01">all just happened as the memo is going</text>
  <text start="99.679" dur="2.911">to be released and we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="101" dur="4.74">talking about that a little bit later in</text>

  <text start="105.74" dur="7.95">McCabe here the former FBI director and</text>
  <text start="109.869" dur="5.441">it looks like the internal watchdog from</text>
  <text start="113.69" dur="3.959">the Justice Department has been</text>
  <text start="115.31" dur="3.809">investigating former FBI deputy director</text>

  <text start="123.979" dur="4.801">Inspector General Michael Horowitz want</text>
  <text start="126.38" dur="4.409">to know why McCabe allegedly took little</text>

  <text start="139.79" dur="5.61">sexting with an underage girl and we can</text>
  <text start="143.51" dur="3.599">see that this story with McCabe gets</text>
  <text start="145.4" dur="3.809">deeper and deeper and deeper and of</text>
  <text start="147.109" dur="4.261">course it&amp;#39;s tied to Clinton it&amp;#39;s tied to</text>
  <text start="149.209" dur="6.59">many different things we already see</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="8.22">that the FBI director he is basically</text>
  <text start="155.799" dur="6.611">looking at this memo and he&amp;#39;s reporting</text>
  <text start="159.59" dur="5.16">that he has grave concerns over the</text>

  <text start="179.06" dur="4.86">because it&amp;#39;s not accurate at all now the</text>
  <text start="181.79" dur="4.35">corporate media they&amp;#39;re going to run</text>
  <text start="183.92" dur="2.97">with this when the memo is eventually</text>
  <text start="186.14" dur="2.22">released</text>
  <text start="186.89" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re gonna say this is not accurate</text>

  <text start="473.82" dur="3.87">supposed to be in there are the</text>

  <text start="477.69" dur="6.21">rest they weren&amp;#39;t invited in they</text>
  <text start="479.58" dur="6.9">invaded a country now Lavrov was out in</text>
  <text start="483.9" dur="4.59">Sochi and they made the decision to</text>
  <text start="486.48" dur="4.62">establish a constitutional committee and</text>
  <text start="488.49" dur="6.69">this is going along with the UN</text>
  <text start="491.1" dur="5.25">resolution to 254 the work of this new</text>
  <text start="495.18" dur="2.31">structure of the constitutional</text>
  <text start="496.35" dur="3.75">committee to prepare the Syrian</text>
  <text start="497.49" dur="5.58">Constitution will be organized in Geneva</text>
  <text start="500.1" dur="6.39">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="503.07" dur="6.18">this as the individuals left Sochi and</text>
  <text start="506.49" dur="6.599">these people were returning back to</text>
  <text start="509.25" dur="6.419">their homes those people that were from</text>
  <text start="513.089" dur="4.861">Syria landed at the Damascus</text>
  <text start="515.669" dur="3.031">International Airport and as they were</text>
  <text start="517.95" dur="4.32">landing</text>
  <text start="518.7" dur="7.31">all of a sudden rockets were fired at</text>
  <text start="522.27" dur="6.63">them now we can see that this was done</text>
  <text start="526.01" dur="5.079">specifically they don&amp;#39;t want the peace</text>
  <text start="528.9" dur="6.54">to go forward and they were trying to</text>
  <text start="531.089" dur="5.911">hit that plane to try to you know create</text>
  <text start="535.44" dur="4.05">some type of problem where the peace</text>
  <text start="537" dur="4.44">talks couldn&amp;#39;t go forward but of course</text>
  <text start="539.49" dur="5.28">it didn&amp;#39;t work now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="7.05">interesting is that Turkey invaded Syria</text>
  <text start="544.77" dur="6.48">going into the Afrin area because of the</text>
  <text start="548.49" dur="5.13">Kurds because of what has been going on</text>
  <text start="551.25" dur="4.74">there where the Cabal was building a</text>
  <text start="553.62" dur="5.88">force to go on to the border turkey said</text>
  <text start="555.99" dur="6.3">no way they came into Syria to push them</text>
  <text start="559.5" dur="5.22">back the Kurds said listen we need</text>
  <text start="562.29" dur="4.71">Damascus help we need their help were</text>
  <text start="564.72" dur="4.8">part of Syria they should be defending</text>
  <text start="567" dur="5.7">Syria with us and this was part of the</text>
  <text start="569.52" dur="5.22">plan we also see that now it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="572.7" dur="5.16">about 10 days and the operation is</text>
  <text start="574.74" dur="5.76">called Operation olive branch which</text>
  <text start="577.86" dur="6.06">means like you know peace the Afrin</text>
  <text start="580.5" dur="5.64">offensive well it looks like they</text>
  <text start="583.92" dur="3.859">allowed the Syrian army to make</text>
  <text start="586.14" dur="6.99">substantial progress</text>
  <text start="587.779" dur="7.87">in both Eid Lib and Syria which is very</text>
  <text start="593.13" dur="5.55">interesting how the Syrian army now is</text>
  <text start="595.649" dur="6.961">making progress in this area as turkey</text>
  <text start="598.68" dur="7.08">is pushing their agenda in Afrin I think</text>
  <text start="602.61" dur="6.289">this was all planned and this was being</text>
  <text start="605.76" dur="6.269">done to help the Syrian army and</text>
  <text start="608.899" dur="5.531">hopefully get the Cabal out of Syria</text>
  <text start="612.029" dur="3.75">this was the whole plan and I think it</text>
  <text start="614.43" dur="3.63">is working even though the corporate</text>
  <text start="615.779" dur="4.081">media saying it isn&amp;#39;t it looks like from</text>
  <text start="618.06" dur="5.52">all intents purposes that this is</text>
  <text start="619.86" dur="6.99">actually working right now we also see</text>
  <text start="623.58" dur="8.37">that the deep state well they have</text>
  <text start="626.85" dur="7.56">already sent a message now we see there</text>
  <text start="631.95" dur="5.25">was an Amtrak train they were carrying</text>
  <text start="634.41" dur="6.45">Republican lawmakers and they were going</text>
  <text start="637.2" dur="7.02">to an area where they were going to meet</text>
  <text start="640.86" dur="6.81">a like a retreat area and we can see</text>
  <text start="644.22" dur="6.66">there was a dump truck that crashed into</text>
  <text start="647.67" dur="5.82">the train now this was a chartered train</text>
  <text start="650.88" dur="3.959">this wasn&amp;#39;t like a public train where</text>
  <text start="653.49" dur="2.909">everyone was getting on and there were</text>
  <text start="654.839" dur="3.781">as many different stops this was a</text>
  <text start="656.399" dur="5.221">chartered train carrying dozens of</text>
  <text start="658.62" dur="6.089">Republican lawmakers to a Republican</text>
  <text start="661.62" dur="8.25">retreat in West Virginia and out of</text>
  <text start="664.709" dur="8.07">nowhere a dump truck well came in</text>
  <text start="669.87" dur="6.39">contact with this train now Minnesota</text>
  <text start="672.779" dur="5.941">Rep Jason Lewis who represents Minnesota</text>
  <text start="676.26" dur="4.47">suburban second District well it looks</text>
  <text start="678.72" dur="2.85">like he was injured and he was</text>
  <text start="680.73" dur="4.08">hospitalized</text>
  <text start="681.57" dur="10.1">we know that the individual in the truck</text>
  <text start="684.81" dur="11.46">died now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>

  <text start="696.27" dur="6.569">chartered train all the roads were</text>
  <text start="699.3" dur="8.58">closed for security reasons how did the</text>
  <text start="702.839" dur="7.921">dump truck get into this area and the</text>
  <text start="707.88" dur="5.399">dump truck can&amp;#39;t you know it&amp;#39;s it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="710.76" dur="5.25">see the flashing red signals that a</text>
  <text start="713.279" dur="6.481">train was coming and when you look at</text>
  <text start="716.01" dur="5.25">the Train it looks like the truck rammed</text>
  <text start="719.76" dur="5.43">into the Train</text>
  <text start="721.26" dur="7.82">to derail it and this was the attempt it</text>
  <text start="725.19" dur="7.44">made now what we&amp;#39;re looking at right now</text>
  <text start="729.08" dur="6.4">possibly is a false flag by the deep</text>
  <text start="732.63" dur="5.7">state sending a message sending a</text>
  <text start="735.48" dur="4.26">message to all these individuals stop</text>
  <text start="738.33" dur="4.2">what you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="739.74" dur="5.31">I mean Q did say there was going to be</text>
  <text start="742.53" dur="5.1">many different false flag attempts and I</text>
  <text start="745.05" dur="5.76">think this is one of them I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="747.63" dur="5.52">this is the big one I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="750.81" dur="6.54">sending a message saying do not release</text>
  <text start="753.15" dur="7.7">the memo hasn&amp;#39;t been released yet don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="757.35" dur="7.89">go any further with the investigations</text>
  <text start="760.85" dur="7.8">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that CNN</text>
  <text start="765.24" dur="6.9">is reporting that the Pentagon conducted</text>
  <text start="768.65" dur="5.38">two tests of the u.s. mess of the US</text>
  <text start="772.14" dur="4.47">missile defense system and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="774.03" dur="6.06">saying that it failed to intercept a</text>
  <text start="776.61" dur="7.29">missile now think back when Obama was</text>
  <text start="780.09" dur="6.06">president they did a test and they said</text>
  <text start="783.9" dur="4.95">it was completely successful intercepted</text>
  <text start="786.15" dur="6.93">the missile no problems everything was</text>
  <text start="788.85" dur="8.16">fantastic now they&amp;#39;re saying there were</text>
  <text start="793.08" dur="6.3">two tests and we couldn&amp;#39;t intercept a</text>
  <text start="797.01" dur="5.25">missile now back then I reported that</text>
  <text start="799.38" dur="4.14">they knew the trajectory they knew the</text>
  <text start="802.26" dur="3.36">type of missile they knew everything</text>
  <text start="803.52" dur="3.93">they were able to plot the course and</text>
  <text start="805.62" dur="5.7">they were able to intercept the missile</text>
  <text start="807.45" dur="6.45">and in real life you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="811.32" dur="6.15">know everything about this missile that</text>
  <text start="813.9" dur="5.43">is headed our way today they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="817.47" dur="7.05">broadcasting and letting everyone know</text>
  <text start="819.33" dur="7.08">that we can&amp;#39;t stop a missile approaching</text>
  <text start="824.52" dur="3.68">the United States think about the</text>
  <text start="826.41" dur="3.87">message that they&amp;#39;re putting out there</text>
  <text start="828.2" dur="5.05">they&amp;#39;re saying that the United States</text>
  <text start="830.28" dur="7.19">doesn&amp;#39;t have the ability through two</text>
  <text start="833.25" dur="7.86">tests to stop an incoming missile and</text>
  <text start="837.47" dur="7.26">they&amp;#39;re saying that if North Korea now</text>
  <text start="841.11" dur="8.73">of course they&amp;#39;re making the the entire</text>
  <text start="844.73" dur="7.09">production of North Korea they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="849.84" dur="4.35">close to a ballistic missile that can</text>
  <text start="851.82" dur="3.33">reach the United States most likely they</text>
  <text start="854.19" dur="3.81">already have it</text>
  <text start="855.15" dur="4.379">and they&amp;#39;re getting ready to use it now</text>
  <text start="858" dur="3.74">it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense why they would use</text>
  <text start="859.529" dur="4.681">it because North Korea South Korea</text>
  <text start="861.74" dur="4.51">they&amp;#39;re working together they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="864.21" dur="4.53">to the Olympics together the Olympics</text>
  <text start="866.25" dur="4.01">are gonna be held very very soon but</text>
  <text start="868.74" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re trying to make the case that</text>
  <text start="870.26" dur="7.6">that&amp;#39;s where this missile is going to be</text>
  <text start="873.21" dur="7.71">coming from now like I said this dump</text>
  <text start="877.86" dur="6.15">truck that hit this train I think was</text>
  <text start="880.92" dur="4.71">just a message a false flag a message</text>
  <text start="884.01" dur="5.329">they&amp;#39;re gonna make it look like it was</text>
  <text start="885.63" dur="7.5">an accident but the message was sent I</text>
  <text start="889.339" dur="5.321">do believe that if this memo is released</text>
  <text start="893.13" dur="2.85">of course they&amp;#39;re going to try to play</text>
  <text start="894.66" dur="3.869">it down they&amp;#39;re gonna push more</text>
  <text start="895.98" dur="3.84">propaganda most likely it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="898.529" dur="3.451">work and remember what Q said it</text>
  <text start="899.82" dur="3.54">propaganda fails we&amp;#39;re gonna have an</text>
  <text start="901.98" dur="5.549">event from hell</text>
  <text start="903.36" dur="5.85">a major false flag if the propaganda</text>
  <text start="907.529" dur="6.091">doesn&amp;#39;t does not convince the public</text>
  <text start="909.21" dur="7.62">that the fisa memo is inaccurate it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="913.62" dur="5.909">meaningless it makes no sense nothing to</text>
  <text start="916.83" dur="4.86">see here people move along if all of</text>
  <text start="919.529" dur="4.441">this fails and more information comes</text>
  <text start="921.69" dur="5.57">out and their propaganda trying to</text>
  <text start="923.97" dur="8.37">convince the public all fails guess what</text>
  <text start="927.26" dur="8.17">they&amp;#39;re going to push another false flag</text>
  <text start="932.34" dur="4.439">now what do we have coming up we talked</text>
  <text start="935.43" dur="4.47">about the Super Bowl</text>
  <text start="936.779" dur="6">which is coming up very soon Sunday we</text>
  <text start="939.9" dur="6.3">talked about the Hawaii missile alert</text>
  <text start="942.779" dur="5.191">system we&amp;#39;re talking about how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="946.2" dur="5.52">saying the United States cannot</text>
  <text start="947.97" dur="5.99">intercept a missile now these are the</text>
  <text start="951.72" dur="4.74">things that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="953.96" dur="4.629">there could be other things that we</text>
  <text start="956.46" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t even know about where they might</text>
  <text start="958.589" dur="7.201">try something just like this train there</text>
  <text start="961.83" dur="5.34">might be a place or time where Trump and</text>
  <text start="965.79" dur="4.13">maybe other party members are all</text>
  <text start="967.17" dur="6.109">together and there might be some type of</text>
  <text start="969.92" dur="6.88">Islamic state chemical weapons attack</text>
  <text start="973.279" dur="6.011">someplace where they say oh he&amp;#39;s in Palm</text>
  <text start="976.8" dur="4.8">Beach he&amp;#39;s watching the Superbowl and</text>
  <text start="979.29" dur="4.08">the Islamic state went after him</text>
  <text start="981.6" dur="4.77">we don&amp;#39;t know I mean this could be a</text>
  <text start="983.37" dur="5.43">possibility and they might try to get</text>
  <text start="986.37" dur="3.99">him maybe with sarin gas or something</text>
  <text start="988.8" dur="3.36">like that doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they hurt</text>
  <text start="990.36" dur="4.35">many many people in this area it makes</text>
  <text start="992.16" dur="5.7">no difference to them it could be a</text>
  <text start="994.71" dur="6.53">cyber attack along with physical attacks</text>
  <text start="997.86" dur="7.56">like a dirty nuke or something like that</text>
  <text start="1001.24" dur="7.36">anything where they can distract</text>
  <text start="1005.42" dur="4.98">everyone from what is really going on it</text>
  <text start="1008.6" dur="3.69">has to be big it can&amp;#39;t be something</text>
  <text start="1010.4" dur="6.9">that&amp;#39;s small but I think we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1012.29" dur="8.46">the first part of it and if those</text>
  <text start="1017.3" dur="6.96">individuals who are taking down the deep</text>
  <text start="1020.75" dur="5.189">state if they don&amp;#39;t acknowledge the</text>
  <text start="1024.26" dur="4.319">message and stop what they&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="1025.939" dur="4.65">they continue on with releasing more of</text>
  <text start="1028.579" dur="4.051">this information like the FISA memo and</text>
  <text start="1030.589" dur="4.441">a lot of other things the deep state</text>
  <text start="1032.63" dur="7.17">then is going to resort to a much bigger</text>
  <text start="1035.03" dur="8.01">false flag and I think the Trump</text>
  <text start="1039.8" dur="5.1">administration is getting prepared for</text>
  <text start="1043.04" dur="4.139">this they know that something big is</text>
  <text start="1044.9" dur="5.84">going to happen you already mentioned it</text>
  <text start="1047.179" dur="7.081">and they know if the propaganda fails</text>
  <text start="1050.74" dur="7.18">yes it will happen it&amp;#39;s a sure thing and</text>
  <text start="1054.26" dur="5.64">I see already that we don&amp;#39;t know where</text>
  <text start="1057.92" dur="3.53">it&amp;#39;s going to be maybe they do but we</text>
  <text start="1059.9" dur="3.51">know from all the indicators that</text>
  <text start="1061.45" dur="4.54">something is headed our way</text>
  <text start="1063.41" dur="4.71">and why do we want to know the</text>
  <text start="1065.99" dur="4.38">why do we keep mentioning this the</text>
  <text start="1068.12" dur="5.34">reason we continually mention this is</text>
  <text start="1070.37" dur="6.6">because when they do something we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1073.46" dur="5.43">already looked at it analyzed it and</text>
  <text start="1076.97" dur="4.23">said this is where they&amp;#39;re headed so we</text>
  <text start="1078.89" dur="4.41">can expect something like this if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1081.2" dur="4.26">expecting something to happen like this</text>
  <text start="1083.3" dur="4.2">it just didn&amp;#39;t happen out of the blue</text>
  <text start="1085.46" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s not terrorists it&amp;#39;s not anything</text>
  <text start="1087.5" dur="7.29">like that it was created by them that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1091.25" dur="7.14">why we put it out there that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="1094.79" dur="5.88">say listen eyes open everyone listening</text>
  <text start="1098.39" dur="5.34">make sure we understand what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1100.67" dur="5.25">because we&amp;#39;re expecting the deep state</text>
  <text start="1103.73" dur="6.06">the Cabal to do something and when they</text>
  <text start="1105.92" dur="6.36">do do it we&amp;#39;ve been talking about why</text>
  <text start="1109.79" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re doing it when they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1112.28" dur="4.68">do it and maybe how they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1114.53" dur="4.59">it and we pick out certain locations so</text>
  <text start="1116.96" dur="3.45">we understand that this is where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1119.12" dur="3.09">going to hit now of course they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1120.41" dur="2.88">make it seem like it&amp;#39;s North Korea</text>
  <text start="1122.21" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;re gonna make it seem like maybe</text>
  <text start="1123.29" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s the Islamic state or maybe even</text>
  <text start="1125.03" dur="5.1">Russia who knows where they&amp;#39;re gonna say</text>
  <text start="1127.34" dur="4.05">who it is but we can see right now maybe</text>
  <text start="1130.13" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;ll even say it&amp;#39;s a person that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1131.39" dur="6.63">unhappy with Trump we don&amp;#39;t know but we</text>
  <text start="1134.75" dur="5.28">do know because we&amp;#39;ve been discussing it</text>
  <text start="1138.02" dur="3.81">we do know that they&amp;#39;re going to attempt</text>
  <text start="1140.03" dur="4.2">something we do know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1141.83" dur="4.77">becoming this desperate and we should</text>
  <text start="1144.23" dur="5.1">expect something to happen and then we</text>
  <text start="1146.6" dur="5.55">have to rip it apart and say yes this is</text>
  <text start="1149.33" dur="6.51">how they did it this is why they did it</text>
  <text start="1152.15" dur="6.15">these things don&amp;#39;t make sense so expect</text>
  <text start="1155.84" dur="3.77">something to happen I would expect</text>
  <text start="1158.3" dur="4.52">something to happen from now until</text>
