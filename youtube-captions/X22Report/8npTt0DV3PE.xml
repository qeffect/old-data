  <text start="85.39" dur="4.17">gonna become bolder and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="87.4" dur="3.93">more outspoken because as they keep</text>
  <text start="89.56" dur="4.5">making these deals and getting rid of</text>
  <text start="91.33" dur="5.94">the globalists system they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="94.06" dur="6.08">raise their voices and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="97.27" dur="5.34">make deals that will benefit America and</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="4.39">remember we need to get out of this</text>
  <text start="102.61" dur="4.649">central bank economy this is not a</text>
  <text start="104.53" dur="6.81">people&amp;#39;s economy this is a an economy</text>
  <text start="107.259" dur="6.72">that was designed created by the central</text>
  <text start="111.34" dur="5.61">banking establishment for their benefit</text>
  <text start="113.979" dur="5.581">you always need to keep that in mind and</text>
  <text start="116.95" dur="5.55">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is Trump and</text>
  <text start="119.56" dur="7.5">those behind the scenes they are using</text>
  <text start="122.5" dur="9.18">the central bank system to enable them</text>
  <text start="127.06" dur="9.03">to build the infrastructure create these</text>
  <text start="131.68" dur="6.839">deals use their funny money and use it</text>
  <text start="136.09" dur="2.82">against them that is what is happening</text>
  <text start="138.519" dur="3.72">right now</text>
  <text start="138.91" dur="5.34">now there&amp;#39;s two sides to the economy we</text>
  <text start="142.239" dur="3.421">have the manipulated economy which has</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="3.209">been going on for a very long time</text>
  <text start="145.66" dur="3.93">because we know the Fed has been</text>
  <text start="147.459" dur="3.571">manipulating it those in government have</text>
  <text start="149.59" dur="3.03">been manipulating it and it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="151.03" dur="4.739">being manipulated actually the</text>
  <text start="152.62" dur="4.649">calculations for GDP unemployment and</text>
  <text start="155.769" dur="4.201">the rest they really haven&amp;#39;t changed</text>
  <text start="157.269" dur="4.921">that much they might have continued the</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="4.65">manipulation by manipulating them a</text>
  <text start="162.19" dur="5.91">little bit more but they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="164.62" dur="5.31">same type of manipulation and this is</text>
  <text start="168.1" dur="4.38">why you see unemployment going down this</text>
  <text start="169.93" dur="5.16">is why you see GDP going up and this is</text>
  <text start="172.48" dur="5.009">not the first time GDP was changed it</text>
  <text start="175.09" dur="6.36">was changed during Obama&amp;#39;s reign where</text>
  <text start="177.489" dur="5.641">they went all the way back to 1929 they</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="3.509">added in research and development into</text>
  <text start="183.13" dur="4.12">the GDP numbers to bring the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="184.959" dur="4.631">up and they</text>
  <text start="187.25" dur="6.63">they basically recalculated everything</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="6.18">all the way to today and we see this has</text>
  <text start="193.88" dur="3.57">been happening for a very long time so</text>
  <text start="195.77" dur="3.66">we have two economies we have the</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="4.02">manipulated economy and then we have the</text>
  <text start="199.43" dur="3.93">people&amp;#39;s economy the people&amp;#39;s economy is</text>
  <text start="201.47" dur="3.21">the real economy this is what people are</text>
  <text start="203.36" dur="3.51">feeling every day this is what people</text>
  <text start="204.68" dur="5.04">are looking at every day this is what</text>
  <text start="206.87" dur="5.07">you have in your bank this is what you</text>
  <text start="209.72" dur="4.53">have in your wallet it&amp;#39;s the job that</text>
  <text start="211.94" dur="4.29">you have do you have enough money to pay</text>

  <text start="216.23" dur="4.56">enough money to purchase a house that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.69" dur="4.019">the people&amp;#39;s economy and when you look</text>
  <text start="220.79" dur="4.35">at the people&amp;#39;s economy you can see that</text>
  <text start="222.709" dur="4.771">it is breaking down there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="225.14" dur="5.01">around this yes you might feel great</text>
  <text start="227.48" dur="5.04">think about this for a second if you</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="4.32">owned a home and you&amp;#39;re in your house</text>
  <text start="232.52" dur="4.11">and you had your job just make up a</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="4.95">number here $50,000 a year and you</text>
  <text start="236.63" dur="5.78">bought your house at 200 or 300 thousand</text>
  <text start="239.42" dur="6.14">dollars and the house keeps moving up</text>
  <text start="242.41" dur="6.01">350 it appreciates four hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="245.56" dur="6.22">five hundred thousand you feel great on</text>
  <text start="248.42" dur="5.849">paper you feel incredible everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.78" dur="5.1">going your way you still have the same</text>
  <text start="254.269" dur="4.021">fifty thousand dollar job but you feel</text>
  <text start="256.88" dur="3.389">better because your house is</text>
  <text start="258.29" dur="5.49">appreciating this is what the central</text>
  <text start="260.269" dur="5.491">bankers used against us yes people do</text>
  <text start="263.78" dur="5.99">have the ability to benefit from it but</text>
  <text start="265.76" dur="8.01">also people lost a lot from their homes</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="6.04">but they use this to psychologically</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="4.41">convince us that the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="275.81" dur="4.41">well when you hear I&amp;#39;ll on the corporate</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="3.57">media that the stock market&amp;#39;s going up</text>
  <text start="280.22" dur="3.09">people think well then the economy must</text>
  <text start="281.75" dur="4.08">be doing well then if the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.31" dur="5.07">going up it&amp;#39;s all psychological</text>
  <text start="285.83" dur="4.44">so Trump right now with those behind him</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re pushing the stock market up</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="5.73">people are feeling good trade deals are</text>
  <text start="293.54" dur="5.1">happening he&amp;#39;s talking about bringing</text>
  <text start="296" dur="4.31">back manufacturing to United States</text>
  <text start="298.64" dur="4.529">people are feeling good it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.31" dur="5.74">psychological but when you look at what</text>
  <text start="303.169" dur="5.851">the real economy is you still see stores</text>
  <text start="306.05" dur="5.1">closing you still see online sales</text>

  <text start="311.15" dur="5.01">housing prices they&amp;#39;re starting to come</text>
  <text start="313.01" dur="5.37">down now we still see the debt moving up</text>
  <text start="316.16" dur="4.96">very very quickly not just in the US but</text>
  <text start="318.38" dur="5.319">globally this is what</text>
  <text start="321.12" dur="4.98">opening real-time and when you look at</text>
  <text start="323.699" dur="5.22">different indicators like sentiment</text>
  <text start="326.1" dur="5.16">index you have the humic you also have</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="5.101">the other one which is the conference</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="5.85">board which is government sponsored you</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="4.32">can see things are definitely happening</text>
  <text start="337.11" dur="3.66">now it depends on which way you look at</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="4.02">this if you look at the you Mitch okay</text>
  <text start="340.77" dur="2.04">this is done by surveys and things like</text>
  <text start="342.36" dur="2.67">that</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="5.85">you see these sentiment index has</text>

  <text start="352.08" dur="5.369">the lowest since November 2016</text>
  <text start="354.139" dur="6.191">expectations measure decreased to eighty</text>
  <text start="357.449" dur="5.761">seven point one so when we look at the</text>
  <text start="360.33" dur="5.97">humic current economic conditions</text>
  <text start="363.21" dur="5.4">indicator it is fell to the lowest level</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="4.14">since November 2016 because people are</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="3.69">still losing their jobs toys-r-us closed</text>
  <text start="370.44" dur="4.349">many many other stores closed people</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="4.83">lost their jobs other corporations they</text>
  <text start="374.789" dur="5.1">are laying off and we&amp;#39;re seeing this in</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="7.319">many different parts of the country now</text>
  <text start="379.889" dur="7.171">if you look at the buying conditions on</text>
  <text start="384.449" dur="5.22">the umit&amp;#39;s you can see that people are</text>
  <text start="387.06" dur="5.789">saying listen home buying conditions</text>
  <text start="389.669" dur="6.631">were viewed less favorably than any time</text>
  <text start="392.849" dur="5.04">since November December 2008 vehicle</text>
  <text start="396.3" dur="5.31">buying conditions were viewed less</text>
  <text start="397.889" dur="5.761">favorably then since late 2013 mine</text>
  <text start="401.61" dur="4.29">conditions for household durables were</text>
  <text start="403.65" dur="5.43">viewed less favorably then since late</text>
  <text start="405.9" dur="5.43">2015 and when we look at this and we see</text>
  <text start="409.08" dur="4.95">the you Mitch reporting this and we go</text>
  <text start="411.33" dur="4.95">back in time to 2008 we had the same</text>
  <text start="414.03" dur="4.83">thing happened then if you go back to</text>
  <text start="416.28" dur="4.65">2001 the same thing happened then when</text>
  <text start="418.86" dur="3.779">people were looking at do you feel like</text>
  <text start="420.93" dur="3.6">this is a good time to start purchasing</text>
  <text start="422.639" dur="5.371">people say no I don&amp;#39;t feel like it is</text>
  <text start="424.53" dur="4.83">and that is the real people&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="428.01" dur="3.089">now of course we have a</text>
  <text start="429.36" dur="6.57">government-sponsored conference board</text>
  <text start="431.099" dur="6.811">and it is at 22 year highs it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.93" dur="4.5">completely opposite of what the image is</text>
  <text start="437.91" dur="4.05">reporting right now so we have the</text>
  <text start="440.43" dur="4.35">government telling us that everything is</text>
  <text start="441.96" dur="5.01">great and the people saying not so</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="6.06">fantastic yes the stock market&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="446.97" dur="5.819">up yes what we&amp;#39;re seeing through these</text>
  <text start="450.84" dur="4.169">statistical numbers it looks great but</text>
  <text start="452.789" dur="4.981">this is all being done on</text>
  <text start="455.009" dur="5.28">purpose what&amp;#39;s happening here is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.77" dur="5.28">using the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="460.289" dur="4.35">system against them because what is the</text>
  <text start="463.05" dur="3.989">mainstream media gonna come out and say</text>
  <text start="464.639" dur="4.92">oh no you&amp;#39;re faking the numbers because</text>
  <text start="467.039" dur="3.66">how do you know this and if they say</text>
  <text start="469.559" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re faking the numbers</text>
  <text start="470.699" dur="3.45">well they&amp;#39;ll say listen we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="472.559" dur="3.33">changed any of these numbers and if we</text>
  <text start="474.149" dur="3.781">go back in time that means Obama faked</text>
  <text start="475.889" dur="4.53">it that means Bush faked it</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="3.719">that means Clinton faked it so the</text>
  <text start="480.419" dur="3.81">mainstream media is never gonna call</text>
  <text start="481.649" dur="5.371">them out on this so that they have the</text>
  <text start="484.229" dur="5.43">ability to use this against them now</text>
  <text start="487.02" dur="5.669">Trump is breaking down the globalists</text>
  <text start="489.659" dur="5.19">system one piece at a time and this has</text>
  <text start="492.689" dur="4.771">to be done before the new system is</text>
  <text start="494.849" dur="6.63">created earlier today</text>
  <text start="497.46" dur="6.66">the EU trade chief said listen why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="501.479" dur="5.791">we get rid of tariffs on the automobiles</text>
  <text start="504.12" dur="5.879">and you would think that Trump would</text>
  <text start="507.27" dur="6.209">have said absolutely let&amp;#39;s do it but as</text>
  <text start="509.999" dur="6.9">a as a reminder the e used car tariff of</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="7.401">10% is higher than the general US auto</text>
  <text start="516.899" dur="7.821">tariffs of 2.5 percent America imposes a</text>
  <text start="520.88" dur="7.829">25% duty on light truck and pickups and</text>
  <text start="524.72" dur="7.33">Trump said it&amp;#39;s not good enough why</text>
  <text start="528.709" dur="7.231">because their consumer habits are to buy</text>
  <text start="532.05" dur="6.99">their cars not to buy our cars</text>
  <text start="535.94" dur="5.23">eliminating the tariffs on US auto</text>
  <text start="539.04" dur="5.039">imports would do little for General</text>
  <text start="541.17" dur="8.099">Motors Ford but would lend a major boost</text>
  <text start="544.079" dur="8.521">to Germany&amp;#39;s BMW and the rest so we see</text>
  <text start="549.269" dur="6.771">right now he&amp;#39;s not agreeing to what</text>
  <text start="552.6" dur="6.03">these central bank institutions want</text>
  <text start="556.04" dur="5.08">because he knows once they get rid of</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="4.98">the central bank the United States and</text>
  <text start="561.12" dur="4.73">the people here need to work we need to</text>
  <text start="563.61" dur="5.4">manufacture we need to have good trade</text>
  <text start="565.85" dur="5.859">we see that Bloomberg might have</text>
  <text start="569.01" dur="6">blatantly violated off-the-record</text>
  <text start="571.709" dur="6.601">agreement as Trump and many others were</text>
  <text start="575.01" dur="5.699">discussing Canada on the new NAFTA</text>
  <text start="578.31" dur="5.129">agreement and Trump came out and said</text>
  <text start="580.709" dur="4.711">wow I made off-the-record comments to</text>
  <text start="583.439" dur="3.9">Bloomberg concerning Canada and this</text>
  <text start="585.42" dur="2.97">powerful understanding was blatantly</text>
  <text start="587.339" dur="3.511">violated Oh</text>
  <text start="588.39" dur="4.35">just more dishonest reporting I&amp;#39;m used</text>
  <text start="590.85" dur="4.59">to it at least Canada knows where I</text>
  <text start="592.74" dur="4.71">stand so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how the talks</text>
  <text start="595.44" dur="3.93">go with Canada most likely they&amp;#39;ll end</text>
  <text start="597.45" dur="3.99">up agreeing to something because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="599.37" dur="4.05">already seen that Mexico Mexico agreed</text>
  <text start="601.44" dur="4.92">and Canada is not going to be left out</text>
  <text start="603.42" dur="5.7">now Trump also made another announcement</text>
  <text start="606.36" dur="5.79">and he&amp;#39;s made this one before where he</text>
  <text start="609.12" dur="6.39">said that if the World Trade</text>
  <text start="612.15" dur="4.89">Organization doesn&amp;#39;t shape up he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="615.51" dur="3.06">to withdraw the United States from the</text>
  <text start="617.04" dur="3.36">World Trade Organization I think he</text>
  <text start="618.57" dur="4.11">continually says this because what is</text>
  <text start="620.4" dur="4.26">happening here as we get rid of the</text>
  <text start="622.68" dur="2.91">globalist system eventually we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="624.66" dur="2.19">going to need the World Trade</text>
  <text start="625.59" dur="4.04">Organization remember this is a</text>
  <text start="626.85" dur="5.88">centralized area where all trade is</text>
  <text start="629.63" dur="5.38">manipulated through what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="632.73" dur="5.04">and what China is actually doing right</text>
  <text start="635.01" dur="5.49">now they&amp;#39;re creating bilateral trades</text>
  <text start="637.77" dur="4.56">where we have trade agreements with</text>
  <text start="640.5" dur="4.71">different countries separate and apart</text>
  <text start="642.33" dur="5.64">from the World Trade Organization like</text>
  <text start="645.21" dur="4.65">we had a trade deal made with Mexico we</text>
  <text start="647.97" dur="4.71">have a trade deal with them we have a</text>
  <text start="649.86" dur="4.56">trade deal with the UK these two trade</text>
  <text start="652.68" dur="3.36">deals have nothing to do with each other</text>
  <text start="654.42" dur="3.54">what the globalists were doing before</text>
  <text start="656.04" dur="4.74">they were controlling it in a</text>
  <text start="657.96" dur="4.23">centralized location getting away from</text>
