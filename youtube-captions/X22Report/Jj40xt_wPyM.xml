  <text start="83.31" dur="4.68">and its various agencies they are</text>
  <text start="86.19" dur="2.85">continually spying on american people</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="2.55">actually they don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="3.48">Constitution they don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="5.01">rights of the people actually they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="92.52" dur="5.19">care about the people period and we are</text>
  <text start="95.55" dur="4.38">getting more and more proof of this as</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="4.62">time goes on and it&amp;#39;s actually getting</text>
  <text start="99.93" dur="4.95">worse and worse and if you remember back</text>
  <text start="102.33" dur="5.31">the NSA was caught spying on the people</text>
  <text start="104.88" dur="4.14">of course they lied in front of Congress</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="3.03">saying no we are not and then it came</text>
  <text start="109.02" dur="3.36">out that yeah they are they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="4.08">intercepting texts they&amp;#39;re intercepting</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="5.22">emails they&amp;#39;re intercepting phone calls</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="4.17">and of course Obama came out and he said</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="3.3">well we&amp;#39;re going to look into this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="118.92" dur="5.01">going to clean this up and nothing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.9" dur="6.36">changed actually it&amp;#39;s worse now and a</text>
  <text start="123.93" dur="5.699">federal judge judge thomas hogan wrote</text>
  <text start="127.26" dur="3.99">an opinion that the court is extremely</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="4.201">concerned about the NSA&amp;#39;s behavior</text>
  <text start="131.25" dur="3.75">noting that they are violating the law</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="3.84">by failing to delete information</text>
  <text start="135" dur="7.47">collected on the internet within the</text>
  <text start="137.67" dur="6.27">periods mandated now personally they</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="2.67">should not have any of our data is</text>
  <text start="143.94" dur="3.84">because when you look at the Fourth</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="6.39">Amendment you need a warrant to collect</text>
  <text start="147.78" dur="5.849">this type of information and right now</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="3.75">it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter because the NSA</text>
  <text start="153.629" dur="5.76">is doing whatever they want so is the</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="8.519">FBI so is DHS and we can see as time</text>
  <text start="159.389" dur="5.051">goes on they are continually violating</text>
  <text start="163.799" dur="2.291">more</text>
  <text start="164.44" dur="4.41">and more of our rights and I know I</text>
  <text start="166.09" dur="6.3">mentioned this before but the democracy</text>
  <text start="168.85" dur="5.79">sprang me peaceful protesters in DC well</text>
  <text start="172.39" dur="3.15">people were arrested there and of course</text>
  <text start="174.64" dur="3.18">they were arrested for crowding</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="5.76">obstructing and every other thing they</text>
  <text start="177.82" dur="6.78">can throw at them but remember the First</text>
  <text start="181.3" dur="6">Amendment allows people to peacefully</text>
  <text start="184.6" dur="6.09">protest now the First Amendment says</text>
  <text start="187.3" dur="6.15">Congress shall make no law respecting an</text>
  <text start="190.69" dur="5.49">establishment of religion or prohibiting</text>
  <text start="193.45" dur="5.7">the free exercise thereof or abridging</text>
  <text start="196.18" dur="6.33">the freedom of speech or of the press or</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="5.91">the right of the people peaceably to</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="6.39">assemble and to petition the government</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="7.53">for a redress of grievances this is</text>
  <text start="208.9" dur="7.02">exactly what they were doing and there</text>
  <text start="212.59" dur="8.58">is no law that over rides this but they</text>
  <text start="215.92" dur="8.01">were arrested this shows us when we look</text>
  <text start="221.17" dur="4.71">at the spine when we look at what the</text>
  <text start="223.93" dur="6.33">police are doing today what the</text>
  <text start="225.88" dur="6.9">government is doing they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="5.07">anymore about the rights of the people</text>
  <text start="232.78" dur="5.13">now if you really expand this and you</text>
  <text start="235.33" dur="6.6">take it to common core the kids today</text>
  <text start="237.91" dur="6.54">are going to grow up believing the</text>
  <text start="241.93" dur="6.12">government has the right to violate your</text>
  <text start="244.45" dur="8.67">rights and the brainwashing has already</text>
  <text start="248.05" dur="7.439">started and as time goes on as they keep</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="5.52">rewriting the rights because if you look</text>
  <text start="255.489" dur="5.491">in the textbooks they rewrite them to</text>
  <text start="258.64" dur="4.11">make it seem like they&amp;#39;re privileges and</text>
  <text start="260.98" dur="3.48">you&amp;#39;ll see as the next edition of these</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="4.32">books come out they&amp;#39;ll make them as</text>
  <text start="264.46" dur="3.47">privileges and before you know it</text>
  <text start="267.07" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;ll have the whole population</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="5.62">convinced that these are privileges that</text>
  <text start="271.96" dur="7.08">the government can take away at any time</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="8.07">but they are not we have rights we are</text>
  <text start="279.04" dur="7.08">born with them and the founding fathers</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="6.51">put this ear on purpose believe me every</text>
  <text start="286.12" dur="6.09">other country that doesn&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="288.13" dur="6.69">they wish they did and the government</text>
  <text start="292.21" dur="5.34">right now is continually chipping away</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="3.12">and trying to violate each and every one</text>
  <text start="297.55" dur="4.73">of them</text>
  <text start="297.94" dur="9.33">as time goes on the only way we can</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="7.81">voice our concerns is with we all stand</text>
  <text start="307.27" dur="6.03">together and we say listen you cannot</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="6.42">violate our rights if you do you broken</text>
  <text start="313.3" dur="5.04">our contract we&amp;#39;ve the people and you</text>
  <text start="316.51" dur="5.07">can no longer be in government at this</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="6.63">point the people have to back all of</text>
  <text start="321.58" dur="4.74">this up without the people backing it up</text>
  <text start="324.97" dur="3.42">the government is going to try to do</text>
  <text start="326.32" dur="4.47">whatever they possibly can to get rid of</text>
  <text start="328.39" dur="6.42">them and this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="330.79" dur="6.57">do at this time now out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="334.81" dur="4.77">see the ceasefire it is starting to fall</text>
  <text start="337.36" dur="6.09">apart just like in Syria right now the</text>
  <text start="339.58" dur="6.99">OSCE they have recorded about 4,700</text>
  <text start="343.45" dur="5.7">times in the last 24 hours that the</text>
  <text start="346.57" dur="5.1">ceasefire was violated so things are</text>
  <text start="349.15" dur="5.07">starting to ramp up Putin understands</text>
  <text start="351.67" dur="5.1">this so he is putting together another</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="5.49">meeting of the contact group and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="356.77" dur="6.24">gonna be meeting in Minsk today to talk</text>
  <text start="359.71" dur="4.92">about what&amp;#39;s going on in Ukraine and one</text>
  <text start="363.01" dur="6.39">of the key things that Putin is going to</text>
  <text start="364.63" dur="8.25">hit upon is why Kiev is not fulfilling</text>
  <text start="369.4" dur="5.94">the Minsk to ceasefire deal what steps</text>
  <text start="372.88" dur="5.94">are they going to take to meet the</text>
  <text start="375.34" dur="7.62">commitment of the deal and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="378.82" dur="7.89">see what Ukraine the US government says</text>
  <text start="382.96" dur="8.34">about this most likely they&amp;#39;ll make up</text>
  <text start="386.71" dur="6.86">some type of an excuse now out in Yemen</text>
  <text start="391.3" dur="4.53">we see the battle is still going on the</text>
  <text start="393.57" dur="5.17">ceasefire kind of broke down they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.83" dur="5.64">trying to reestablish another ceasefire</text>
  <text start="398.74" dur="5.01">and some peace talks but very</text>
  <text start="401.47" dur="5.25">interestingly Saudi Arabia was flying</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="4.62">their jets over Yemen and the civilians</text>
  <text start="406.72" dur="3.78">ran they thought it was going to be</text>
  <text start="408.37" dur="4.049">another bombing and all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="410.5" dur="4.14">seek rates fall from the sky with</text>
  <text start="412.419" dur="6">parachutes on them and what they</text>
  <text start="414.64" dur="6.48">realized is that Saudi Arabia they were</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="5.551">dropping guns ammunition to their</text>
  <text start="421.12" dur="5.58">popular resistance allies inside the</text>
  <text start="423.97" dur="6.15">country and the civilians took the</text>
  <text start="426.7" dur="4.74">crates with all the weaponry there were</text>
  <text start="430.12" dur="4.77">16 wooden box</text>
  <text start="431.44" dur="6.45">they either had rocket or sniper rifles</text>
  <text start="434.89" dur="6.96">in them and they are now selling them</text>
  <text start="437.89" dur="5.61">and making money off of these weapons at</text>
  <text start="441.85" dur="4.98">this point and it looks like a lot of</text>
  <text start="443.5" dur="6.29">Hootie&amp;#39;s are purchasing these weapons</text>
  <text start="446.83" dur="6.06">from them and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="449.79" dur="4.93">the war in Yemen is not over we</text>
  <text start="452.89" dur="4.77">understand that the United States is</text>
  <text start="454.72" dur="5.19">working with the United Arab Emirates to</text>
  <text start="457.66" dur="3.42">push another offensive of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.91" dur="4.26">saying they&amp;#39;re going in there to fight</text>
  <text start="461.08" dur="6.36">al-qaeda but we know the truth it is to</text>
  <text start="464.17" dur="5.52">bring more forces into Yemen to put</text>
  <text start="467.44" dur="4.86">pressure on the who teased because they</text>
  <text start="469.69" dur="5.49">need to pay for kicking out the puppet</text>
  <text start="472.3" dur="6.48">government in Yemen now the Kurdistan</text>
  <text start="475.18" dur="6.36">Workers Party they said a month ago they</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="8.06">proposed a ceasefire deal with Turkey</text>
  <text start="481.54" dur="9.72">and Turkey completely said no way and</text>
  <text start="486.84" dur="7.11">they rejected the plan and they said</text>
  <text start="491.26" dur="5.82">listen we&amp;#39;re offering them a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="493.95" dur="5.08">we can have peace here there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="3.3">for this and it looks like turkey keeps</text>
  <text start="499.03" dur="3.69">looking the other way and saying you</text>
  <text start="500.38" dur="5.25">know something we don&amp;#39;t want peace here</text>
  <text start="502.72" dur="4.62">we want war now we see the Syrian</text>
  <text start="505.63" dur="4.02">government and the opposition they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="507.34" dur="3.9">reached an agreement to let people out</text>
  <text start="509.65" dur="3.389">of the besieged towns because the</text>
  <text start="511.24" dur="3.989">opposition they were complaining about</text>
  <text start="513.039" dur="5.101">the government not letting humanitarian</text>
  <text start="515.229" dur="5.671">aid in not letting people out and the</text>
  <text start="518.14" dur="4.35">agreement was made and it looks like 250</text>
  <text start="520.9" dur="4.17">people will leave the two pro-government</text>
  <text start="522.49" dur="4.05">towns in northwestern Syria in exchange</text>
  <text start="525.07" dur="3.66">for the same number to be evacuated from</text>
  <text start="526.54" dur="5.16">the rebel-held town near the Lebanese</text>
  <text start="528.73" dur="6.18">border and it looks like they&amp;#39;re made</text>
  <text start="531.7" dur="5.7">this deal and we&amp;#39;re seeing aid come in</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re seeing people being led out of</text>
  <text start="537.4" dur="4.11">these towns and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="3.78">that the Syrian government right now</text>
  <text start="541.51" dur="4.29">they are continually pushing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="543.7" dur="4.95">state back and we see that there&amp;#39;s a tug</text>
  <text start="545.8" dur="6.39">of war going on in Aleppo and dare Azure</text>
  <text start="548.65" dur="5.58">we see the syrup Arab army the 104th</text>
  <text start="552.19" dur="4.62">airborne brigade of the Republic guard</text>
  <text start="554.23" dur="5.58">back by the National Defense Forces they</text>
  <text start="556.81" dur="5.31">liberated key districts and dare azure</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="5.22">and they are continually doing this and</text>
  <text start="562.12" dur="4.98">at this point we see the u.s.</text>
  <text start="565.03" dur="5.13">is really backed in a corner right now</text>
  <text start="567.1" dur="4.68">because the ceasefire deal is falling</text>
  <text start="570.16" dur="7.98">apart one of the opposition groups</text>
  <text start="571.78" dur="10.32">walked out and we see that there is no</text>
  <text start="578.14" dur="8.55">peace right now the people of the</text>
  <text start="582.1" dur="8.28">country have voted for the government</text>
  <text start="586.69" dur="5.78">body of Assad and everything the US has</text>
  <text start="590.38" dur="5.46">been telling the world that the people</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="4.87">want Assad removed well all this is</text>
  <text start="595.84" dur="4.35">turning out to be fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="597.34" dur="4.83">which we already knew and it&amp;#39;s becoming</text>
  <text start="600.19" dur="4.74">more and more difficult to prove the</text>
  <text start="602.17" dur="4.25">reasons why Assad must be removed and I</text>
  <text start="604.93" dur="5.43">don&amp;#39;t think at this point in time</text>
  <text start="606.42" dur="6.37">they&amp;#39;re not really worrying about that</text>
  <text start="610.36" dur="4.89">at this point and I think they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="612.79" dur="5.25">and moving towards the bigger picture</text>
  <text start="615.25" dur="5.34">and the bigger picture is to have war</text>
  <text start="618.04" dur="5.7">with Russia now we&amp;#39;ve discussed this</text>
  <text start="620.59" dur="4.95">many times before where the moderate</text>
  <text start="623.74" dur="5.34">rebels and the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="625.54" dur="7.62">al-nusrah Islamic state al Qaeda they</text>
  <text start="629.08" dur="6.63">can morph back and forth so the Syrian</text>
  <text start="633.16" dur="5.58">government the Russian government and</text>
  <text start="635.71" dur="5.79">any other government really can&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="638.74" dur="4.89">heads or tails of who&amp;#39;s who and Lavrov</text>
  <text start="641.5" dur="4.38">is out there and he&amp;#39;s going to ask the</text>
  <text start="643.63" dur="6.84">UN Security Council to put groups</text>
  <text start="645.88" dur="7.92">undermining the ceasefire on the</text>
  <text start="650.47" dur="4.98">terrorist list he said we will soon</text>
  <text start="653.8" dur="4.44">raise the question in the UN Security</text>
  <text start="655.45" dur="5.19">Council of including those sabotaging</text>
  <text start="658.24" dur="4.86">and undermining the truce but trying to</text>
  <text start="660.64" dur="5.25">hide under new names on the terrorist</text>
  <text start="663.1" dur="5.46">list there is much evidence that</text>
  <text start="665.89" dur="5.55">al-nusrah is mimicking and trying to</text>
  <text start="668.56" dur="5.04">disguise itself under new names uniting</text>
  <text start="671.44" dur="4.44">with small groups not including not</text>
  <text start="673.6" dur="6.63">included in terrorist lists hence trying</text>
  <text start="675.88" dur="8.19">to escape retribution and we see that</text>
  <text start="680.23" dur="5.64">Russia is on to the tricks of the United</text>
  <text start="684.07" dur="4.94">States the tricks of Saudi Arabia the</text>
  <text start="685.87" dur="6.6">tricks of the paid mercenary they</text>
  <text start="689.01" dur="6.76">realize that these groups just morph</text>
  <text start="692.47" dur="5.73">into each other to avoid what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="695.77" dur="3.24">and this is part of the ceasefire plan</text>
  <text start="698.2" dur="5.21">of the United</text>

  <text start="703.41" dur="5.38">moderate rebels are in a certain area</text>
  <text start="706.05" dur="5.35">Russia the Syrian government will not</text>
  <text start="708.79" dur="4.11">fire upon that area so if the Islamic</text>
  <text start="711.4" dur="4.26">states there all they have to do is</text>
  <text start="712.9" dur="5.79">morph them into the moderate rebels if</text>
  <text start="715.66" dur="5.22">al-nusrah or al-qaeda is there all they</text>
  <text start="718.69" dur="3.93">have to do is morph them into them or</text>
  <text start="720.88" dur="3.18">change them into a different terrorist</text>
  <text start="722.62" dur="3.75">groups which is not on the list like</text>
  <text start="724.06" dur="5.4">Lavrov was saying and this is part of</text>
  <text start="726.37" dur="6.48">the plan to keep certain key areas in</text>
  <text start="729.46" dur="5.48">Syria and he went on to say that</text>
  <text start="732.85" dur="3.99">terrorists who pass themselves off as</text>

  <text start="736.84" dur="6">ceasefire in Syria should be destroyed</text>
  <text start="739.54" dur="5.1">so we&amp;#39;re seeing that they&amp;#39;re getting fed</text>

  <text start="744.64" dur="4.17">United States government central bankers</text>

  <text start="792.66" dur="7.41">this is all propaganda it&amp;#39;s a huge act</text>
  <text start="796.18" dur="6.72">they know what the agreement is and</text>
  <text start="800.07" dur="4.72">Syria is coming out there the getting</text>

  <text start="807.28" dur="6.98">don&amp;#39;t even represent the Syrian nation</text>

  <text start="814.26" dur="6.49">evidence a leaked document that came out</text>
  <text start="816.64" dur="5.85">that the Islamic state and we know the</text>
  <text start="820.75" dur="5.43">opposition is part of them they&amp;#39;re from</text>

  <text start="840.19" dur="5.55">by the United States government central</text>
  <text start="841.6" dur="7.62">bankers now we see Obama he has arrived</text>
  <text start="845.74" dur="5.31">in Saudi Arabia to reassure Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="849.22" dur="5.91">that everything is fine well I think</text>
  <text start="851.05" dur="8.82">what&amp;#39;s happening here is that Saudi</text>
  <text start="855.13" dur="8.43">Arabia is looking to move away from the</text>
  <text start="859.87" dur="7.5">US financial system and if we go back in</text>
  <text start="863.56" dur="5.88">time we see the US was waving these 28</text>
  <text start="867.37" dur="4.02">pages all around saying yes it&amp;#39;s Saudi</text>
  <text start="869.44" dur="3.36">Arabia well they already told us it was</text>
  <text start="871.39" dur="2.759">Saudi Arabia so we don&amp;#39;t have to look</text>
  <text start="872.8" dur="4.59">into the document because they wanted</text>
  <text start="874.149" dur="4.411">that out there and I think in these</text>
  <text start="877.39" dur="4.379">pages it&amp;#39;s going to tell you absolutely</text>
  <text start="878.56" dur="7.92">nothing but we see that Congress push</text>
  <text start="881.769" dur="6.301">this law to hold other countries</text>
  <text start="886.48" dur="4.02">responsible and to do an investigation</text>
  <text start="888.07" dur="4.68">to find out what really happened and</text>
  <text start="890.5" dur="3.99">this is one of the things that the</text>
  <text start="892.75" dur="4.37">administration doesn&amp;#39;t want to come out</text>
  <text start="894.49" dur="5.73">the other thing I think is happening is</text>
  <text start="897.12" dur="4.86">they are blackmailing Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="900.22" dur="5.64">because Saudi Arabia right now is</text>
  <text start="901.98" dur="6.13">looking to move away from the US</text>
  <text start="905.86" dur="7.589">financial system they realize at this</text>
  <text start="908.11" dur="8.49">time that the petrodollar is done and if</text>
  <text start="913.449" dur="5.551">they stay along this route that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="916.6" dur="5.04">on right now it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="919" dur="4.68">and utter disaster and i think they</text>
  <text start="921.64" dur="3.72">mentioned that they wanted to sell some</text>
  <text start="923.68" dur="3.3">of their assets and the u.s. is saying</text>
  <text start="925.36" dur="5.61">absolutely not even if they went ahead</text>
  <text start="926.98" dur="6.81">and they sold the Treasuries the 750</text>
  <text start="930.97" dur="4.26">billion worth of Treasuries it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="933.79" dur="3.63">going to have that much of an effect on</text>
  <text start="935.23" dur="5.219">the US government the Fed they can</text>
  <text start="937.42" dur="4.289">create this money and slurp up all those</text>
  <text start="940.449" dur="6.33">treasures they&amp;#39;ve done it with China</text>
  <text start="941.709" dur="8.551">they sold over 700 billion plus worth of</text>
  <text start="946.779" dur="6.511">Treasuries and they want to sell other</text>
  <text start="950.26" dur="5.16">assets because they&amp;#39;re trying to move</text>
  <text start="953.29" dur="4.68">away from the financial system and they</text>
  <text start="955.42" dur="4.169">don&amp;#39;t want to be stuck in it right now</text>
  <text start="957.97" dur="5.88">because think about what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="959.589" dur="6.631">here Russia has stopped the United</text>
  <text start="963.85" dur="5.76">States Saudi Arabia Qatar Turkey</text>
  <text start="966.22" dur="7.11">the rest of the coalition forces twice</text>
  <text start="969.61" dur="4.95">now in Syria and they realize they need</text>
  <text start="973.33" dur="4.41">to get into Syria because eventually</text>
  <text start="974.56" dur="4.8">they want to get into a rim they want to</text>
  <text start="977.74" dur="3.51">take over they want the pipeline going</text>
  <text start="979.36" dur="4.8">up and this is becoming more and more</text>
  <text start="981.25" dur="6.45">difficult and they understand that the</text>
  <text start="984.16" dur="5.43">system is collapsing they realize that</text>
  <text start="987.7" dur="5.94">the dollar is not going to be around for</text>
  <text start="989.59" dur="5.97">much longer they&amp;#39;re not kept in the dark</text>
  <text start="993.64" dur="4.44">like the people here in the United</text>
  <text start="995.56" dur="4.65">States many countries realize at this</text>
  <text start="998.08" dur="5.04">point that the dollar is at its end game</text>
  <text start="1000.21" dur="4.56">this is why they&amp;#39;re making preps where</text>
  <text start="1003.12" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re saying okay we&amp;#39;re going to make</text>
  <text start="1004.77" dur="4.53">deals with China we&amp;#39;re going to keep the</text>
  <text start="1007.14" dur="4.68">one and reserve we&amp;#39;re going to be using</text>
  <text start="1009.3" dur="6.24">our own currencies for purchasing petrol</text>
  <text start="1011.82" dur="5.55">I mean purchasing oil and we can see</text>
  <text start="1015.54" dur="3.26">right now that they&amp;#39;re continually doing</text>
  <text start="1017.37" dur="4.95">and they&amp;#39;re not using the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="1018.8" dur="7.99">so it looks like Saudi Arabia is looking</text>
  <text start="1022.32" dur="8.46">to move away from the US financial</text>
  <text start="1026.79" dur="6.6">system and the US said no no no you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1030.78" dur="4.68">not we need to keep you where you are</text>
  <text start="1033.39" dur="4.02">because if you do this this is going to</text>
  <text start="1035.46" dur="3.42">be a big problem because many other</text>
  <text start="1037.41" dur="5.1">nations are going to start moving away</text>
  <text start="1038.88" dur="5.67">from the US dollar and this going</text>
  <text start="1042.51" dur="3.75">forward is going to be a huge huge</text>
  <text start="1044.55" dur="5.16">problems now everything wrapped around</text>
  <text start="1046.26" dur="5.1">these 28 pages actually there are many</text>
  <text start="1049.71" dur="3.81">different agendas associated with this</text>
  <text start="1051.36" dur="5.79">and as we continually get more and more</text>
  <text start="1053.52" dur="6.15">information we see that there are a lot</text>
  <text start="1057.15" dur="6.36">of things wrapped up in what is going on</text>
  <text start="1059.67" dur="7.32">here because we have to realize that up</text>
  <text start="1063.51" dur="5.46">into this point throughout history the</text>
  <text start="1066.99" dur="5.58">government has been lying to the people</text>
  <text start="1068.97" dur="5.85">been lying around the world and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1072.57" dur="5.49">continually lying and you know how that</text>
  <text start="1074.82" dur="7.02">is when you continually lie it gets</text>
  <text start="1078.06" dur="7.23">harder and harder to cover the lie and</text>
  <text start="1081.84" dur="5.88">then you have to lie some more and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1085.29" dur="4.41">coming to the point where many of the</text>
  <text start="1087.72" dur="4.98">countries are starting to look at this</text>
  <text start="1089.7" dur="5.58">and say okay we understand what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1092.7" dur="5.55">on here the system is crashing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1095.28" dur="4.42">collapsing at this point there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1098.25" dur="4.63">not going to last that</text>
  <text start="1099.7" dur="6.599">much longer and many of these countries</text>
  <text start="1102.88" dur="5.85">are trying to maneuver themselves away</text>
  <text start="1106.299" dur="5.941">from the u.s. trying to separate</text>
  <text start="1108.73" dur="6.15">themselves now this is difficult because</text>
  <text start="1112.24" dur="4.38">we understand that the u.s. is spying on</text>
  <text start="1114.88" dur="3.96">many government officials and you see</text>
  <text start="1116.62" dur="4.47">how this comes into play where they can</text>
  <text start="1118.84" dur="4.079">use blackmail to say no no you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1121.09" dur="4.049">staying where we are we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1122.919" dur="5.941">using the refugees throughout Europe to</text>
  <text start="1125.139" dur="6">bring Europe into the Middle East they</text>
  <text start="1128.86" dur="4.71">want soldiers they want military assets</text>
  <text start="1131.139" dur="6.03">they want to go after Assad they want a</text>
  <text start="1133.57" dur="5.52">war with Russia and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="1137.169" dur="3.931">see they&amp;#39;re becoming very very desperate</text>
  <text start="1139.09" dur="4.41">and this is what should make everyone</text>
  <text start="1141.1" dur="5.25">nervous at this point because as they</text>
  <text start="1143.5" dur="6.179">become more and more desperate as the</text>
  <text start="1146.35" dur="6.059">lies continue on as countries try to</text>
  <text start="1149.679" dur="5.521">pull away they&amp;#39;re going to use more and</text>
  <text start="1152.409" dur="5.461">more events more false flags to pull</text>
  <text start="1155.2" dur="4.949">them back in to convince the people that</text>
  <text start="1157.87" dur="5.399">you need to be united with the United</text>
  <text start="1160.149" dur="5.64">States and you need to go to war and we</text>
  <text start="1163.269" dur="4.29">can see at this point they are not going</text>
  <text start="1165.789" dur="4.201">to let up they&amp;#39;ll never admit that</text>
  <text start="1167.559" dur="4.801">they&amp;#39;re wrong and they&amp;#39;re gonna push</text>
  <text start="1169.99" dur="5.939">this until the very end because they</text>
  <text start="1172.36" dur="8.76">know at this point they need to start a</text>
  <text start="1175.929" dur="9.72">war somehow someway because if they</text>
  <text start="1181.12" dur="8.64">don&amp;#39;t their entire house of cards comes</text>
  <text start="1185.649" dur="5.551">crashing down and they will be blamed</text>
  <text start="1189.76" dur="4.32">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the US government</text>
  <text start="1191.2" dur="6.27">the central banking system and this is</text>
  <text start="1194.08" dur="7.979">what they&amp;#39;re most afraid of so they will</text>
  <text start="1197.47" dur="10.11">push this to the edge they&amp;#39;ll even go to</text>
  <text start="1202.059" dur="8.761">nuclear war if they have to because they</text>
  <text start="1207.58" dur="5.52">don&amp;#39;t care at this point they believe</text>
