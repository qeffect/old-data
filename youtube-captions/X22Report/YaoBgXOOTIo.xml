  <text start="90.119" dur="6.45">economic collapse news now on Friday the</text>
  <text start="94.35" dur="4.74">job numbers came out and we reviewed</text>
  <text start="96.569" dur="3.811">them and we&amp;#39;re starting to see and this</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="5.07">is also coming from Paul Craig Roberts</text>
  <text start="100.38" dur="7.92">where he&amp;#39;s saying that these job numbers</text>
  <text start="104.16" dur="6.93">for December are worse than we even</text>
  <text start="108.3" dur="6">thought now I talked about how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="111.09" dur="6.15">counting part-time jobs as full-time job</text>
  <text start="114.3" dur="5.099">so if one person has multiple part-time</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="4.95">jobs that is counted as multiple</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="4.351">full-time jobs and what Paul Craig</text>
  <text start="122.19" dur="5.7">Roberts are saying is that the middle</text>
  <text start="123.75" dur="7.5">class jobs are continuing to decline the</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="7.2">new jobs are jobs that pay considerably</text>
  <text start="131.25" dur="5.4">less and we know they&amp;#39;re part time which</text>
  <text start="135.09" dur="3.21">you know the people aren&amp;#39;t getting their</text>
  <text start="136.65" dur="5.04">health benefits people are not getting</text>
  <text start="138.3" dur="5.58">their retirement and the new jobs are</text>
  <text start="141.69" dur="4.86">going to people outside the prime</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="5.719">working age the unavoidable conclusion</text>
  <text start="146.55" dur="6.68">is that for the majority of Americans</text>
  <text start="149.599" dur="9.521">the economic prospects they&amp;#39;re declining</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="9.16">now seasonal adjustments are used during</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="5.25">this period of the year and they do it</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="4.65">throughout other parts a</text>
  <text start="164.37" dur="6">of the year and what we are seeing right</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="6.69">now is that this this entire payroll</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="11.1">number the seasonally adjusted gain</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="11.03">which was 292,000 is telling us that the</text>
  <text start="181.47" dur="6.72">jobs added were not 292,000 now I</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="6.009">calculated that these jobs if we</text>
  <text start="188.19" dur="5.28">subtract the multiple of two or three</text>
  <text start="190.769" dur="5.161">part-time jobs we would really add about</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="4.2">what ninety thousand eighty thousand but</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="5.089">Paul Craig Roberts broke her down even</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="7.98">further and when he subtracted out all</text>
  <text start="201.019" dur="10.47">the multiple part-time jobs it looks</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="9.179">like we gained around 11,000 jobs and</text>
  <text start="211.489" dur="6.97">what this tells us is that the labor</text>
  <text start="214.829" dur="6.511">force is a lot worse than we expected</text>
  <text start="218.459" dur="4.681">which we kinda knew and we knew the</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="3.63">government was continually manipulating</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="5.459">all these numbers and he went on to say</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="7.23">if all this was real the labor force</text>
  <text start="228.599" dur="5.73">participation rate would not continually</text>
  <text start="232.2" dur="5.009">be declining and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="234.329" dur="5.97">seeing because you have to remember they</text>
  <text start="237.209" dur="5.221">are not counting those people who</text>
  <text start="240.299" dur="5.041">haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview in the last</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="5.07">four weeks and if you&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="3.539">sending out resumes and you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="3.84">getting anyone to respond to these</text>
  <text start="248.879" dur="4.411">resumes or as people have been emailing</text>
  <text start="251.34" dur="5.31">me saying that there&amp;#39;s no place to even</text>
  <text start="253.29" dur="6.059">send their resumes you&amp;#39;re not counted as</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="5.25">looking for a job they count you as out</text>
  <text start="259.349" dur="5.88">of the labor force and this is what</text>
  <text start="261.9" dur="4.829">they&amp;#39;ve been doing and people get</text>
  <text start="265.229" dur="2.97">discouraged and say okay I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="266.729" dur="4.351">trying and trying and trying and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.199" dur="5.131">just no jobs for me whatsoever and we</text>
  <text start="271.08" dur="5.42">can see at this point that this economy</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="6.54">right now is built up on a complete</text>
  <text start="276.5" dur="6.46">illusion and it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="5.1">harder to convince everyone that the</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="4.17">economy is doing well and as we break</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="6.24">down the numbers and the manipulated</text>
  <text start="287.13" dur="6.539">statistics we are seeing that yeah this</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="6.03">whole thing is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="293.669" dur="4.681">and the economy is right back where we</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="3.09">started into</text>
  <text start="298.35" dur="4.92">thousand eight and it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="300.33" dur="4.89">than that and we know that the United</text>
  <text start="303.27" dur="6.66">States government central bankers need</text>
  <text start="305.22" dur="7.32">to provoke a war now remember they came</text>
  <text start="309.93" dur="5.16">out with North Korea saying that they</text>
  <text start="312.54" dur="4.65">detonated a nuclear weapon underground</text>
  <text start="315.09" dur="4.56">which created this earthquake and of</text>
  <text start="317.19" dur="5.36">course everything so far shows there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="4.98">no evidence that they&amp;#39;ve done this and</text>
  <text start="322.55" dur="4.54">they&amp;#39;re continually pushing the</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="4.83">propaganda oh my god we need to ramp up</text>
  <text start="327.09" dur="5.28">our military spending the South Koreans</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="5.01">already put together their loudspeaker</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="5.91">system and we see the United States</text>
  <text start="334.47" dur="6.93">using more provocation towards North</text>
  <text start="338.28" dur="6.69">Korea the u.s. conducted a b-52 flight</text>
  <text start="341.4" dur="6.84">in South Korea on Sunday and they flew</text>
  <text start="344.97" dur="5.16">over of course they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="348.24" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;ve done this to reinforce the</text>
  <text start="350.13" dur="4.98">Pacific countries that the United States</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="5.58">is behind them but this was done to</text>
  <text start="355.11" dur="5.3">provoke North Korea all of this is being</text>
  <text start="357.96" dur="5.31">done to provoke all these countries</text>
  <text start="360.41" dur="6.58">because what is happening right now is</text>
  <text start="363.27" dur="7.08">that this economy is collapsing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="5.34">running out of time Russia kind of</text>
  <text start="370.35" dur="6.54">messed up their plans in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="372.33" dur="9.39">in Ukraine and they need to get a war</text>
  <text start="376.89" dur="6.84">started we see out in Ukraine Kiev has</text>
  <text start="381.72" dur="4.14">reinforced its position along the line</text>
  <text start="383.73" dur="4.53">of engagement in daum bass with a</text>
  <text start="385.86" dur="5.37">howitzer battery battery and a right</text>
  <text start="388.26" dur="7.41">sector radicals are moving more and more</text>
  <text start="391.23" dur="7.08">equipment up to this line and they are</text>
  <text start="395.67" dur="5.19">definitely getting prepared for a major</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="6.51">offensive we&amp;#39;re also finding out there</text>
  <text start="400.86" dur="7.02">were Ukrainian troops disguised as</text>
  <text start="404.82" dur="5.97">militia fighters who were trying to</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="6.12">hamper the OSCE observers work near the</text>
  <text start="410.79" dur="4.8">village of Vinh own yay located in the</text>
  <text start="414" dur="4.16">buffer zone and you can see right now</text>
  <text start="415.59" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="418.16" dur="6.22">to create some type of incident to cover</text>
  <text start="421.74" dur="4.17">their tracks to cover up that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.38" dur="4.32">continually shelling they have not</text>
  <text start="425.91" dur="6.58">stopped shelling the dawn bass area</text>
  <text start="428.7" dur="7.13">their continuum continually doing this</text>
  <text start="432.49" dur="7.359">we see that turkey is kind of reneging</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="5.639">on the 3 billion deal to control the</text>
  <text start="439.849" dur="4.29">borders now we know the EU gave them</text>
  <text start="441.469" dur="4.92">three billion euros and said listen we</text>
  <text start="444.139" dur="5.071">will give you even more if you stop this</text>
  <text start="446.389" dur="5.131">outflow of refugees and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="3.72">that their turkey is not going to get</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="3.57">any more money because they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="452.93" dur="4.259">stopped the flow and Turkey saying yes</text>
  <text start="455.09" dur="7.099">we have stopped the flow because Greece</text>
  <text start="457.189" dur="7.41">is seeing a decline in the amount of</text>
  <text start="462.189" dur="4.57">refugees coming into their country but</text>
  <text start="464.599" dur="3.72">the EU is saying well we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="466.759" dur="5.581">decline because it&amp;#39;s been bad weather</text>
  <text start="468.319" dur="6.181">and they can&amp;#39;t make the trip so right</text>
  <text start="472.34" dur="5.15">now the EU is saying that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="474.5" dur="6.84">to they&amp;#39;re going to stop the funding and</text>
  <text start="477.49" dur="7.12">stop all of this unless Turkey lives up</text>
  <text start="481.34" dur="4.759">to its promise and we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="484.61" dur="4.769">to watch that situation very carefully</text>
  <text start="486.099" dur="6.72">now a couple days ago the US was out</text>
  <text start="489.379" dur="6.991">there saying that the harry s truman was</text>
  <text start="492.819" dur="6.371">very close to this alleged missile test</text>
  <text start="496.37" dur="4.109">that Iran was holding and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="499.19" dur="3.42">have any proof they didn&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="500.479" dur="4.47">video or satellite information on this</text>
  <text start="502.61" dur="4.5">and then all of a sudden they produced</text>
  <text start="504.949" dur="6.89">some information now when I look at the</text>
  <text start="507.11" dur="6.96">video it looks like an oil tanker um and</text>
  <text start="511.839" dur="5.021">it doesn&amp;#39;t look like an aircraft carrier</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="5.639">but what&amp;#39;s amazing about all of this is</text>
  <text start="516.86" dur="4.799">that they have video footage of this</text>
  <text start="519.709" dur="4.62">which doesn&amp;#39;t look like what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="521.659" dur="6.721">saying it is but they don&amp;#39;t have video</text>
  <text start="524.329" dur="9.271">imagery of the oil tankers that the</text>
  <text start="528.38" dur="8.03">Islamic state we&amp;#39;re using and we know</text>
  <text start="533.6" dur="8.01">that the US has satellites above Syria</text>
  <text start="536.41" dur="8.38">they&amp;#39;re basically holding bombing</text>
  <text start="541.61" dur="7.229">operations in Syria for over a year and</text>
  <text start="544.79" dur="8.88">they never caught on video or satellite</text>
  <text start="548.839" dur="9.81">imagery any of the convoys but the</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="8.85">Treasury always knew how much they were</text>
  <text start="558.649" dur="5.761">making so they really get themselves</text>
  <text start="562.52" dur="3.43">stuck when they start producing these</text>
  <text start="564.41" dur="4.78">videos now when we look at this video</text>
  <text start="565.95" dur="5.94">it looks completely fake it looks like</text>
  <text start="569.19" dur="4.62">this is not even in the area of what</text>
  <text start="571.89" dur="3.69">they were talking about because when you</text>
  <text start="573.81" dur="3.96">look at the ship it looks completely</text>
  <text start="575.58" dur="5.22">like an oil tanker and the whole point</text>
  <text start="577.77" dur="6.51">of this is if there was really a missile</text>
  <text start="580.8" dur="6.69">drill going on why was the aircraft</text>
  <text start="584.28" dur="7.59">carrier so close around 1500 yards away</text>
  <text start="587.49" dur="6.99">they sailed it there for provocation for</text>
  <text start="591.87" dur="5.49">propaganda and we see this happening a</text>
  <text start="594.48" dur="4.95">lot now out in Iran we also see that</text>
  <text start="597.36" dur="4.89">Iranians poured into the streets in an</text>
  <text start="599.43" dur="6.3">anti Saudi protest and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="602.25" dur="7.02">interesting about this protest is that</text>
  <text start="605.73" dur="7.38">the people in the front are carrying</text>
  <text start="609.27" dur="7.14">signs that are in English where they</text>
  <text start="613.11" dur="7.04">have signs go al saud and the question</text>
  <text start="616.41" dur="6.69">to me is who are these signs for it</text>
  <text start="620.15" dur="4.27">looks like they created them and put</text>
  <text start="623.1" dur="4.47">these people in the front and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="624.42" dur="6.18">think this is arraign Iran who did this</text>
  <text start="627.57" dur="6.09">I think this is other forces that are</text>
  <text start="630.6" dur="6.51">basically bringing in agent provocateurs</text>
  <text start="633.66" dur="6.36">paying certain people to gin this up so</text>
  <text start="637.11" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s some type of conflict chaos</text>
  <text start="640.02" dur="4.23">because we know they want the Syrian</text>
  <text start="642.06" dur="4.29">talks derailed we know they want to go</text>
  <text start="644.25" dur="4.41">for the prize but this and with the</text>
  <text start="646.35" dur="4.68">prizes I ran at but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="648.66" dur="4.92">right now there is no reason for these</text>
  <text start="651.03" dur="4.86">signs to be pre printed in English and</text>
  <text start="653.58" dur="4.89">this tells you that this is completely</text>
  <text start="655.89" dur="6.15">set up and these people that were pushed</text>
  <text start="658.47" dur="6.3">to the front are staged and we see this</text>
  <text start="662.04" dur="6.66">happen a lot we see it happen in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="664.77" dur="8.07">we saw it happen in Libya in Lebanon in</text>
  <text start="668.7" dur="7.2">Yemen and basically they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="672.84" dur="5.61">prop propagandize the American people</text>
  <text start="675.9" dur="6.6">with this and they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="678.45" dur="7.94">their agenda in creating complete and</text>
  <text start="682.5" dur="6.21">utter chaos in Iran to basically</text>
  <text start="686.39" dur="4.63">destabilize the entire region and this</text>
  <text start="688.71" dur="4.14">is their plan because their plan with</text>
  <text start="691.02" dur="4.44">Syria is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="692.85" dur="5.37">because Russia is involved there now</text>
  <text start="695.46" dur="3.62">we&amp;#39;re getting reports that the United</text>
  <text start="698.22" dur="3.71">States is</text>
  <text start="699.08" dur="5.4">creating new units to combat terrorist</text>
  <text start="701.93" dur="3.87">propaganda inside the country and the</text>
  <text start="704.48" dur="2.64">Department of Homeland Security and the</text>
  <text start="705.8" dur="2.97">Department of Justice will announce the</text>
  <text start="707.12" dur="6.14">establishment of the countering violent</text>
  <text start="708.77" dur="8.82">extremist extremism task force the cv</text>
  <text start="713.26" dur="6.6">ETF and it&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="717.59" dur="4.83">is that the United States government</text>
  <text start="719.86" dur="4.78">created the Islamic state it is their</text>
  <text start="722.42" dur="4.11">proxy army they handle all the</text>
  <text start="724.64" dur="4.41">propaganda for the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="726.53" dur="6.18">put together the videos with Israel site</text>
  <text start="729.05" dur="5.1">intelligence and other agencies and now</text>
  <text start="732.71" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re creating a group to counter</text>
  <text start="734.15" dur="3.72">their own propaganda and what this tells</text>
  <text start="736.13" dur="4.14">me is that they&amp;#39;re creating this group</text>
  <text start="737.87" dur="5.82">to go after those people who do not</text>
  <text start="740.27" dur="7.2">believe the story that the government is</text>
  <text start="743.69" dur="5.79">pushing out there now Germany they are</text>
  <text start="747.47" dur="5.31">considering the deployment of about 150</text>
  <text start="749.48" dur="4.74">to 200 troops near Libya to assist with</text>
  <text start="752.78" dur="3.84">the training of the Libyan Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="754.22" dur="4.17">and we know what this is all about we</text>
  <text start="756.62" dur="4.94">know there&amp;#39;s thousands of soldiers</text>
  <text start="758.39" dur="7.5">coming in from Egypt the US england</text>
  <text start="761.56" dur="8.05">italy to basically go back into libya</text>
  <text start="765.89" dur="5.79">and get rid of that pesky elected</text>
  <text start="769.61" dur="3.48">government in tripoli and they want to</text>
  <text start="771.68" dur="3.18">reinstall the puppet government and have</text>
  <text start="773.09" dur="3.69">complete control of libya and we can see</text>
  <text start="774.86" dur="5.72">they are getting prepared and ready to</text>
  <text start="776.78" dur="9.06">go into libya for another major invasion</text>
  <text start="780.58" dur="8.56">offensive war to reinsert the puppet</text>
  <text start="785.84" dur="5.76">government now Syria before we have</text>
  <text start="789.14" dur="4.83">these peace talks they have a</text>
  <text start="791.6" dur="5.34">requirement and the Syrian Foreign</text>
  <text start="793.97" dur="4.71">Minister said his government was still</text>
  <text start="796.94" dur="3.99">waiting to receive the names of the</text>
  <text start="798.68" dur="6.51">opposition figures attending the peace</text>
  <text start="800.93" dur="8.4">talks and they also want the groups who</text>
  <text start="805.19" dur="6.12">are considered terrorists and they want</text>
  <text start="809.33" dur="5.78">the coalition forces to come up with</text>
  <text start="811.31" dur="7.56">this list and these requests are</text>
  <text start="815.11" dur="6.1">preconditions for the peace talks and so</text>
  <text start="818.87" dur="3.99">far they have received absolutely</text>
  <text start="821.21" dur="3.27">nothing and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="822.86" dur="3">this very carefully to see if they</text>
  <text start="824.48" dur="2.61">actually get to the piece to us because</text>
  <text start="825.86" dur="4.83">this is supposed to be coming up in</text>
  <text start="827.09" dur="6.78">about 15 days on January 25th or are we</text>
  <text start="830.69" dur="7.07">going to see another major event because</text>
  <text start="833.87" dur="7.68">we see already with Saudi Arabia Jordan</text>
  <text start="837.76" dur="6.46">Qatar Bahrain and all the other</text>
  <text start="841.55" dur="6.42">coalition forces it seems like they are</text>
  <text start="844.22" dur="6.6">preparing and creating chaos in the</text>
  <text start="847.97" dur="4.29">region with Iran and Saudi Arabia and</text>
  <text start="850.82" dur="3.72">the other countries and it looks like</text>
  <text start="852.26" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re trying to continually push this</text>
  <text start="854.54" dur="5.46">agenda further and further until they</text>
  <text start="856.76" dur="7.32">get something going here now we</text>
  <text start="860" dur="9.24">understand that this entire economy is</text>
  <text start="864.08" dur="9.29">falling apart and we understand that the</text>
  <text start="869.24" dur="6.48">dollar is dying the petro dollar is</text>
  <text start="873.37" dur="5.86">dying in the Middle East because all</text>
  <text start="875.72" dur="5.28">these countries have thrown out their</text>
  <text start="879.23" dur="4.29">puppet governments they want their</text>
  <text start="881" dur="4.74">country back they want the central bank</text>
  <text start="883.52" dur="3.9">out they want the US government out of</text>
  <text start="885.74" dur="4.17">their business and they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="887.42" dur="4.08">use the dollar on their natural</text>
  <text start="889.91" dur="3.54">resources they want to use any currency</text>
  <text start="891.5" dur="4.47">they want to use to trade with other</text>
  <text start="893.45" dur="5.13">countries and of course United States</text>
  <text start="895.97" dur="6.27">government central bankers can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="898.58" dur="5.79">this because if they do let this happen</text>
  <text start="902.24" dur="4.2">the dollar collapses and this is why</text>
  <text start="904.37" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re using war and force and killing</text>
  <text start="906.44" dur="4.14">many people to maintain this now</text>
  <text start="908.48" dur="4.65">remember this is not the people of the</text>
  <text start="910.58" dur="5.15">United States this is the central bank /</text>
  <text start="913.13" dur="6.24">US government that is promoting this</text>
  <text start="915.73" dur="7.81">along with other countries and during</text>
  <text start="919.37" dur="7.02">the year of 2013 there was a g20 meeting</text>
  <text start="923.54" dur="6.93">which meant three times once in Moscow</text>
  <text start="926.39" dur="6.54">twice in DC and the second meeting in DC</text>
  <text start="930.47" dur="5.22">in April was part of the meeting with</text>
  <text start="932.93" dur="5.31">the IMF in the World Bank and during</text>
  <text start="935.69" dur="5.76">these meetings it was strongly suspected</text>
  <text start="938.24" dur="7.35">that there was some type of agreement a</text>
  <text start="941.45" dur="8.64">reset agreement and this agreement was</text>
  <text start="945.59" dur="8.66">made based on the US and the dollar</text>
  <text start="950.09" dur="7.11">failing and the petro dollar failing and</text>
  <text start="954.25" dur="5.26">they wanted to switch this over to a new</text>
  <text start="957.2" dur="3.63">system and we can see how this is</text>
  <text start="959.51" dur="3.98">evolving because we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="960.83" dur="4.8">about this for quite a while where</text>
  <text start="963.49" dur="6.18">everything is moving from west</text>
  <text start="965.63" dur="8.07">east and we see that the one now is</text>
  <text start="969.67" dur="5.35">included in the SDR basket and we see</text>
  <text start="973.7" dur="3.36">that they&amp;#39;ve been making bilateral</text>
  <text start="975.02" dur="3.48">trades all around the world they&amp;#39;ve set</text>
  <text start="977.06" dur="3.89">up clearing houses with their a couple</text>
  <text start="978.5" dur="4.47">countries in Africa now that are trading</text>
  <text start="980.95" dur="3.82">using the you wanna instead of the</text>
  <text start="982.97" dur="5.67">dollar which is the reserve currency now</text>
  <text start="984.77" dur="6.84">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="988.64" dur="6.45">instead of the petro dollar what they</text>
  <text start="991.61" dur="7.4">were going to use for the trading of the</text>
  <text start="995.09" dur="8.91">oil was going to be the basket of sdrs</text>
  <text start="999.01" dur="8.59">which include the one the yen the Euro</text>
  <text start="1004" dur="5.79">and we already know that Russia and</text>
  <text start="1007.6" dur="3.36">China are trading not using the dollar</text>
  <text start="1009.79" dur="3.24">whatsoever they&amp;#39;re using their own</text>
  <text start="1010.96" dur="5.16">currencies and they were also talking</text>
  <text start="1013.03" dur="5.22">about using currencies that weren&amp;#39;t in</text>
  <text start="1016.12" dur="5.22">the SDR however the country&amp;#39;s wanted a</text>
  <text start="1018.25" dur="4.2">trade but as we know the US government</text>
  <text start="1021.34" dur="2.91">central bankers they&amp;#39;re not going to let</text>
  <text start="1022.45" dur="3.92">this happen and this is why the trying</text>
  <text start="1024.25" dur="7.91">to provoke war right now because if they</text>
  <text start="1026.37" dur="8.319">went ahead with this plan the outcome</text>
  <text start="1032.16" dur="4.36">would be devastating first of all the</text>
  <text start="1034.689" dur="4.411">United States government would lose</text>
  <text start="1036.52" dur="6.87">their power to impose sanctions on</text>
  <text start="1039.1" dur="9.12">nations they would lose their edge on</text>
  <text start="1043.39" dur="9.36">controlling nations and if this reset</text>
  <text start="1048.22" dur="7.74">was rolled out what would happen well we</text>
  <text start="1052.75" dur="5.46">would see imported goods rise</text>
  <text start="1055.96" dur="4.65">significantly for the first month maybe</text>
  <text start="1058.21" dur="7.02">twenty percent or so another twenty</text>
  <text start="1060.61" dur="8.88">percent soon after and this would put</text>
  <text start="1065.23" dur="7.29">the standard of living in America to</text>
  <text start="1069.49" dur="6.96">drop to the level of Mexico over a year</text>
  <text start="1072.52" dur="5.79">or two may be faster and they were</text>
  <text start="1076.45" dur="4.08">already predicting in this meeting that</text>
  <text start="1078.31" dur="6.41">they&amp;#39;re going to be social unrest in</text>
  <text start="1080.53" dur="9.3">urban centres of Europe and America and</text>
  <text start="1084.72" dur="8.05">they have plans to lock down major</text>
  <text start="1089.83" dur="5.25">cities of the world under their new laws</text>
  <text start="1092.77" dur="6.18">the anti-terror they anti-extremism</text>
  <text start="1095.08" dur="6.66">plans and we see how they were pushing</text>
  <text start="1098.95" dur="4.68">these laws all throughout Europe how the</text>
  <text start="1101.74" dur="5.22">United States has this new propaganda</text>
  <text start="1103.63" dur="6.5">force we have DHS new laws on the books</text>
  <text start="1106.96" dur="6.93">that are going after and defining who</text>
  <text start="1110.13" dur="7.36">terrorists are and we can see that all</text>
  <text start="1113.89" dur="6.57">of this has been done and prepped for</text>
  <text start="1117.49" dur="4.95">this major reset now it looks like</text>
  <text start="1120.46" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re just not going to let this reset</text>
  <text start="1122.44" dur="4.44">happen now let&amp;#39;s not be confused of why</text>
  <text start="1125.86" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re not going to let it happen</text>

  <text start="1147.13" dur="5.55">war to distract what is really coming</text>
  <text start="1149.53" dur="6.3">this is why they need this war because</text>
  <text start="1152.68" dur="8.07">they do believe that they will be able</text>
  <text start="1155.83" dur="10.77">to win the war and then reset the system</text>
