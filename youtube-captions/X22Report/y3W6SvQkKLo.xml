  <text start="239.46" dur="9.11">anymore and of course what we have is</text>
  <text start="243.36" dur="7.95">the government trying to push TPP TTIP</text>
  <text start="248.57" dur="5.13">right now to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="251.31" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re going to make things even better</text>
  <text start="253.7" dur="5.23">but that is going to make it work worse</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="5.34">if we look at NAFTA they told us we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.93" dur="4.44">going to create thousands upon thousands</text>
  <text start="261.63" dur="4.38">of jobs but what do we say we see Ford</text>
  <text start="263.37" dur="6.41">and other manufacturers leaving this</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="6.98">country taking their entire operation</text>
  <text start="269.78" dur="7.39">moving it to other countries we&amp;#39;ve lost</text>
  <text start="272.99" dur="6.01">800,000 manufacturing jobs with NAFTA it</text>
  <text start="277.17" dur="6">did not benefit the people of the United</text>
  <text start="279" dur="7.11">States it actually made it worse we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.17" dur="5.19">losing manufacturing jobs and we see out</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="3.75">in Germany well they don&amp;#39;t want the TTIP</text>
  <text start="288.36" dur="3.75">we know they&amp;#39;ve been protesting and</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="4.86">there was just this huge protests out</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="5.369">there hundreds of thousands of Germans</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="5.44">they went out and they were protest</text>
  <text start="297.479" dur="5.201">the trade agreement with the US and</text>
  <text start="300.16" dur="5.069">Canada because remember there&amp;#39;s two of</text>
  <text start="302.68" dur="5.01">them they have a back-up plan and we can</text>
  <text start="305.229" dur="4.831">see right now they&amp;#39;re saying no if we</text>
  <text start="307.69" dur="6.78">allow this to happen our countries are</text>
  <text start="310.06" dur="8.13">done but we know their whole plan is to</text>
  <text start="314.47" dur="6.84">take over every single country by using</text>
  <text start="318.19" dur="5.099">this court system which is outside of</text>
  <text start="321.31" dur="5.37">the government which controls the</text>
  <text start="323.289" dur="6.331">government on what they can do controls</text>
  <text start="326.68" dur="6.66">the people in what they can do and that</text>
  <text start="329.62" dur="6.54">core system is the isds and we can see</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="6.389">that as this system continually breaks</text>
  <text start="336.16" dur="6.75">down the US government the central</text>
  <text start="339.729" dur="5.461">bankers they&amp;#39;re going to become more and</text>
  <text start="342.91" dur="6.59">more desperate and pushing these</text>
  <text start="345.19" dur="7.949">draconian laws creating false flags</text>
  <text start="349.5" dur="5.5">regime change and we are seeing this we</text>
  <text start="353.139" dur="5.28">mentioned in the Philippines where</text>
  <text start="355" dur="6.36">Rodrigo Duterte he doesn&amp;#39;t want the US</text>
  <text start="358.419" dur="5">there and we need to look at the</text>
  <text start="361.36" dur="6.239">background of what is happening there</text>
  <text start="363.419" dur="6.37">now Rodrigo he was elected on his</text>
  <text start="367.599" dur="4.38">platform that he was going to wage war</text>
  <text start="369.789" dur="4.62">on drugs and return pride to the</text>
  <text start="371.979" dur="5.331">Philippines if the people elected him so</text>
  <text start="374.409" dur="6.031">with less than three months in office</text>
  <text start="377.31" dur="6.88">he&amp;#39;s or already making astounding</text>
  <text start="380.44" dur="6.539">progress on removing the drug problem</text>
  <text start="384.19" dur="4.17">from his country 700,000 drug addicts</text>
  <text start="386.979" dur="4.141">and pushers have surrendered to the</text>
  <text start="388.36" dur="5.82">authorities around 3,000 being killed</text>
  <text start="391.12" dur="5.729">for violently resisting and endangering</text>
  <text start="394.18" dur="5.519">the arresting officers lives those</text>
  <text start="396.849" dur="5.701">people who are quote with drugs well</text>
  <text start="399.699" dur="5.071">they&amp;#39;re taken care of and we have to</text>
  <text start="402.55" dur="4.109">understand what the u.s. involvement is</text>
  <text start="404.77" dur="4.47">in philippines it&amp;#39;s not just with</text>
  <text start="406.659" dur="5.701">military assets and aid they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="409.24" dur="7.53">running a drug operation inside the</text>
  <text start="412.36" dur="6.75">Philippines through the CIA and we can</text>
  <text start="416.77" dur="6.36">see right now Rodrigo Duterte is</text>
  <text start="419.11" dur="6.57">pivoting away from the US and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="5.49">right now if you really listen to what</text>
  <text start="425.68" dur="4.94">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re intensifying the</text>
  <text start="428.62" dur="5.24">media campaign</text>
  <text start="430.62" dur="5.28">in calling him a dictator now this is</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="5.13">the beginning steps of what they</text>
  <text start="435.9" dur="5.43">normally do to replace the leader it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.99" dur="5.1">called regime change and we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="441.33" dur="5.399">down this path and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="5.87">is that the u.s. is pulling out all the</text>
  <text start="446.729" dur="8.25">stops trying to smear do dirt a as a</text>
  <text start="449.96" dur="6.07">rogue third world dictator and right now</text>
  <text start="454.979" dur="3.69">you can see the first step is</text>
  <text start="456.03" dur="6.18">preconditioning the public on why he</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="5.131">needs to be removed because the u.s.</text>
  <text start="462.21" dur="4.92">sees the right sees the writing on the</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="6.41">wall they know that he is going to tell</text>
  <text start="467.13" dur="7.11">them he&amp;#39;s already done this remove</text>
  <text start="470.21" dur="7.15">military assets we don&amp;#39;t want aid we</text>
  <text start="474.24" dur="5.67">don&amp;#39;t want the u.s. in our country now</text>
  <text start="477.36" dur="5.13">he&amp;#39;s just said this but we can see he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.91" dur="5.34">going to put this into action and the US</text>
  <text start="482.49" dur="5.31">will not let this happen so we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="485.25" dur="7.11">to see most likely regime change in the</text>
  <text start="487.8" dur="6.86">Philippines we see right now Russia has</text>
  <text start="492.36" dur="5.7">been calling on the United States to</text>
  <text start="494.66" dur="5.08">release the information on the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="498.06" dur="3.539">and the United States came out and said</text>
  <text start="499.74" dur="4.109">we are not prepared to publicly publish</text>
  <text start="501.599" dur="4.29">the details of the ceasefire whatsoever</text>
  <text start="503.849" dur="3.57">and this was announced from US</text>
  <text start="505.889" dur="4.71">Department State spokesman John Kirby</text>
  <text start="507.419" dur="6.271">and we know why they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="510.599" dur="5.07">release because it shows that the United</text>
  <text start="513.69" dur="5.18">States government central bankers have</text>
  <text start="515.669" dur="7.05">been providing weapons funding and</text>
  <text start="518.87" dur="5.77">supporting and hiring and training the</text>
  <text start="522.719" dur="3.301">terrorists and they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="524.64" dur="3.51">information out there even though it</text>
  <text start="526.02" dur="4.47">really is out there already they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="528.15" dur="4.71">want it release to the public and to</text>
  <text start="530.49" dur="5.61">their coalition forces who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="532.86" dur="9.14">understand what&amp;#39;s really going on we see</text>
  <text start="536.1" dur="10.679">the United States well they flew in and</text>
  <text start="542" dur="8.44">they hit the Syrian army now this was in</text>
  <text start="546.779" dur="6.721">Deir al-zor and there was a huge battle</text>
  <text start="550.44" dur="7.73">going on between the Syrian army and the</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="10.12">Islamic state and the u.s. flew in and</text>
  <text start="558.17" dur="8.359">they killed around 62 soldiers and it</text>
  <text start="563.62" dur="4.11">might it be as high as 80 or so now the</text>
  <text start="566.529" dur="5.25">United States is claiming they do</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="8.73">nothing about who was on either side it</text>
  <text start="571.779" dur="6.631">was a mistake we apologized for it but</text>
  <text start="576.46" dur="5.129">we can see why they were doing it</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="7.8">because there was a strategic location</text>
  <text start="581.589" dur="7.831">and this is the third a mountain area</text>
  <text start="586.21" dur="5.67">near Deir al-zor near the border of Iraq</text>
  <text start="589.42" dur="5.13">and they didn&amp;#39;t want to give up this</text>
  <text start="591.88" dur="3.72">position right here and you have to</text>
  <text start="594.55" dur="3.96">remember the United States government</text>
  <text start="595.6" dur="5.22">central bankers they weren&amp;#39;t invited</text>
  <text start="598.51" dur="7.98">into Syria they invaded a sovereign</text>
  <text start="600.82" dur="8.07">country and the united states is kind of</text>
  <text start="606.49" dur="3.96">losing their credibility actually not</text>
  <text start="608.89" dur="5.31">kind of they have lost their credibility</text>
  <text start="610.45" dur="7.079">with this because this whole ceasefire</text>
  <text start="614.2" dur="8.13">deal was to keep Russia informed of</text>
  <text start="617.529" dur="9.031">where they were striking where they were</text>
  <text start="622.33" dur="7.74">bombing and guess what for this one</text>
  <text start="626.56" dur="4.98">attack they didn&amp;#39;t let them know they</text>
  <text start="630.07" dur="3.15">didn&amp;#39;t let them know that this is where</text>
  <text start="631.54" dur="3.75">they were going to be this is where they</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="6.96">were going to attack so it looks like</text>
  <text start="635.29" dur="6.78">this was actually on purpose because the</text>
  <text start="640.18" dur="5.73">Syrian Armed Forces they were pushed</text>
  <text start="642.07" dur="7.05">back and it proves that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="645.91" dur="6.9">really not serious about fighting terror</text>
  <text start="649.12" dur="6.36">which we already know and we can see</text>
  <text start="652.81" dur="6.84">already with this act the ceasefire is</text>
  <text start="655.48" dur="6.75">really starting to break down now we see</text>
  <text start="659.65" dur="5.64">that they don&amp;#39;t want the Syrian army to</text>
  <text start="662.23" dur="4.65">take control of the border regions with</text>
  <text start="665.29" dur="3.78">Iraq because this is where a lot of</text>
  <text start="666.88" dur="3.75">supplies come in same thing with turkey</text>
  <text start="669.07" dur="4.95">because they have different entry points</text>
  <text start="670.63" dur="5.399">the Golan Heights with Israel they have</text>
  <text start="674.02" dur="5.04">a rack where they have shipments coming</text>
  <text start="676.029" dur="6.151">in they also have Turkey where they</text>
  <text start="679.06" dur="4.38">bring in the terrorist groups so we can</text>
  <text start="682.18" dur="2.55">see they have many different access</text>
  <text start="683.44" dur="3.93">points and they don&amp;#39;t want to lose these</text>
  <text start="684.73" dur="6.68">so they needed to do something at this</text>
  <text start="687.37" dur="7.08">point to control the situation so Russia</text>
  <text start="691.41" dur="4.72">well they&amp;#39;re calling for an emergency UN</text>
  <text start="694.45" dur="3.09">Security Council meeting regarding the</text>
  <text start="696.13" dur="4.35">bombing</text>
  <text start="697.54" dur="6.21">in this area and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="700.48" dur="6.779">that Russia is looking at the situation</text>
  <text start="703.75" dur="7.29">and saying this was absolutely done on</text>
  <text start="707.259" dur="7.56">purpose and we can see already that this</text>
  <text start="711.04" dur="6.57">is an act of war with the Syrian</text>
  <text start="714.819" dur="6.151">government by the United States there in</text>
  <text start="717.61" dur="9.75">a country which they were never invited</text>
  <text start="720.97" dur="9.989">in they invaded a country and they set</text>
  <text start="727.36" dur="6.419">up bases they&amp;#39;re making bombing runs to</text>
  <text start="730.959" dur="4.44">stop terrorists in another country which</text>
  <text start="733.779" dur="5.101">they&amp;#39;re not supposed to be there and</text>
  <text start="735.399" dur="7.081">then they hit the armed forces of that</text>
  <text start="738.88" dur="5.28">country let&amp;#39;s switch this around they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="742.48" dur="3.33">telling us there&amp;#39;s terrorism here in the</text>
  <text start="744.16" dur="4.919">United States where we have the San</text>
  <text start="745.81" dur="5.94">Bernardino shooter he&amp;#39;s radicalized and</text>
  <text start="749.079" dur="4.051">we have all these people if the Syrian</text>
  <text start="751.75" dur="4.23">Armed Forces said you know something</text>

  <text start="792.22" dur="6.84">same situation in Syria so we can see</text>
  <text start="796.42" dur="4.919">right now that this situation is getting</text>
  <text start="799.06" dur="4.5">worse and it is accelerating because</text>

  <text start="823.24" dur="8.34">just falling apart and we realize that</text>
  <text start="828.49" dur="5.82">what has happened is all over the place</text>
  <text start="831.58" dur="4.35">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting I mean it</text>
  <text start="834.31" dur="4.53">was all over the corporate media because</text>
  <text start="835.93" dur="5.82">you just couldn&amp;#39;t hide this but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="838.84" dur="6.51">very interesting as this attack happened</text>
  <text start="841.75" dur="7.53">all of a sudden we had a pipe bomb in</text>
  <text start="845.35" dur="7.47">New Jersey we had an explosion in New</text>
  <text start="849.28" dur="5.28">York in a garbage can and I think the</text>
  <text start="852.82" dur="4.8">one in New Jersey was also a pipe bomb</text>
  <text start="854.56" dur="6.87">and a plastic garbage can we had an</text>
  <text start="857.62" dur="6.54">individual in Minnesota who went on a</text>
  <text start="861.43" dur="7.62">stabbing spree asking people if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="864.16" dur="8.04">a Muslim and referenced Allah i guess</text>
  <text start="869.05" dur="5.43">i&amp;#39;ll be taking away knives now all this</text>
  <text start="872.2" dur="4.5">happening at the same time now those</text>
  <text start="874.48" dur="4.77">stories especially the one in New York</text>
  <text start="876.7" dur="6.18">is the front page news the one about</text>
  <text start="879.25" dur="6.48">Syria is off the grid they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="882.88" dur="5.34">showing that anymore so this was done on</text>
  <text start="885.73" dur="5.01">purpose to get rid of that story now is</text>
  <text start="888.22" dur="4.62">there another agenda associated with</text>
  <text start="890.74" dur="5.94">this well if we really look at what</text>
  <text start="892.84" dur="7.68">happened in New York we see the bomb in</text>
  <text start="896.68" dur="6.66">New York was in a metal trashcan and it</text>
  <text start="900.52" dur="3.93">was Saturday night at eight thirty there</text>
  <text start="903.34" dur="3.03">were about twenty nine people that were</text>
  <text start="904.45" dur="4.2">injured nobody was killed and then they</text>
  <text start="906.37" dur="4.11">found a second IED looked like a</text>
  <text start="908.65" dur="3.96">pressure cooker they had wires sticking</text>
  <text start="910.48" dur="4.62">out actually most likely it wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="912.61" dur="4.05">ready to go off or probably wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="915.1" dur="5.52">real looks like it wasn&amp;#39;t even put</text>
  <text start="916.66" dur="5.67">together correctly and we had these</text>
  <text start="920.62" dur="4.53">other incidences happening around the</text>
  <text start="922.33" dur="5.01">United States now we have many things</text>
  <text start="925.15" dur="4.92">going on here this is of course as we</text>
  <text start="927.34" dur="6.09">know as a distraction and we can see</text>
  <text start="930.07" dur="5.25">right now this distraction was to get</text>
  <text start="933.43" dur="4.71">that news story of what happened in</text>
  <text start="935.32" dur="6.41">Syria off the front page the other part</text>
  <text start="938.14" dur="6.72">of this is is this the build-up to</text>
  <text start="941.73" dur="6.33">postpone the elections because this is</text>
  <text start="944.86" dur="6.45">the beginning stages now we will know if</text>
  <text start="948.06" dur="5.29">this is set for two different agendas</text>
  <text start="951.31" dur="3.45">well the one we already know because</text>
  <text start="953.35" dur="3.39">they took the news story right off the</text>
  <text start="954.76" dur="6.36">front page of what happened in Syria so</text>
  <text start="956.74" dur="7.17">that&amp;#39;s gone if we see more of these</text>
  <text start="961.12" dur="4.44">little type of explosions and you can</text>
  <text start="963.91" dur="4.02">tell they place it in garbage</text>
  <text start="965.56" dur="5.12">away from different areas Saturday night</text>
  <text start="967.93" dur="6.69">it was like a last minute type of thing</text>
  <text start="970.68" dur="5.68">if we see more of these type of little</text>
  <text start="974.62" dur="6.06">incidences making sure they don&amp;#39;t kill</text>
  <text start="976.36" dur="7.229">anyone or nothing really happens to</text>
  <text start="980.68" dur="5.159">structures around the area just to</text>
  <text start="983.589" dur="6">create fear if we see more of this</text>
  <text start="985.839" dur="7.221">around the country this agenda is to</text>
  <text start="989.589" dur="7.111">build up to postpone the elections if</text>
  <text start="993.06" dur="6.67">this just a one time off thing this was</text>
  <text start="996.7" dur="6.27">a distraction to get what happened in</text>
  <text start="999.73" dur="5.34">Syria off the front page of the news to</text>
  <text start="1002.97" dur="4.26">get rid of it to distract people away</text>
  <text start="1005.07" dur="4.62">from it so this is something that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1007.23" dur="4.32">going to have to watch because there was</text>
  <text start="1009.69" dur="5.49">a lot of things happening all at once on</text>
  <text start="1011.55" dur="8.82">a Saturday leading in late afternoon</text>
  <text start="1015.18" dur="6.57">into the evening so let&amp;#39;s watch to see</text>
  <text start="1020.37" dur="2.82">if this accelerates because if it does</text>
  <text start="1021.75" dur="3.15">accelerate and we see more of these</text>
  <text start="1023.19" dur="3.72">around the country leading up to the</text>
