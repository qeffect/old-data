  <text start="222.37" dur="5.67">past no they&amp;#39;re trying to explain what</text>
  <text start="225.91" dur="5.16">is happening right now because think</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="6.09">about it there is no clear direction</text>

  <text start="242.86" dur="5.58">so why are the central bank&amp;#39;s doing the</text>
  <text start="246.37" dur="4.35">opposite of what they were doing before</text>
  <text start="248.44" dur="6.21">the numbers are even better right now</text>
  <text start="250.72" dur="5.31">and we know that this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="254.65" dur="4.53">with what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point</text>
  <text start="256.03" dur="5.1">what is happening right now is that the</text>
  <text start="259.18" dur="5.25">Patriots are in control the entire</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="6.45">system they&amp;#39;re the ones who are calling</text>
  <text start="264.43" dur="4.29">the shot and the Fed is saying well what</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="1.86">we&amp;#39;re trying to do is we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="268.72" dur="2.43">control it</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="3.3">because of inflation we&amp;#39;re really trying</text>
  <text start="271.15" dur="3.42">to get inflation up well their mandate</text>
  <text start="272.74" dur="4.59">is not to have any inflation it supposed</text>
  <text start="274.57" dur="7.349">to have zero inflation that&amp;#39;s part of</text>
  <text start="277.33" dur="6.99">their mandate and yet that&amp;#39;s all they</text>
  <text start="281.919" dur="5.281">can mention think about this for a</text>
  <text start="284.32" dur="4.95">second this entire time the unemployment</text>
  <text start="287.2" dur="5.64">numbers have getting better and better</text>
  <text start="289.27" dur="5.16">and better GDP was recalculated and the</text>
  <text start="292.84" dur="3.93">GDP numbers are looking better and</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="3.57">better and better since Trump came into</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="2.1">the White House the stock market has</text>
  <text start="298" dur="3.24">done what it</text>
  <text start="298.87" dur="4.74">is gone up now during this period of</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="3.75">time they were raising rates and all of</text>
  <text start="303.61" dur="3.93">a sudden they come to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="4.8">when the economy is doing the best it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.54" dur="4.74">ever been and the numbers are getting</text>
  <text start="309.79" dur="6.03">better and better they&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="312.28" dur="6.72">worse they&amp;#39;re getting better so what</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="7.34">does this mean it means they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="319" dur="6.57">cut rates because Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="323.16" dur="4.33">they&amp;#39;re calling the shots so with the</text>
  <text start="325.57" dur="4.86">numbers looking better than they ever</text>
  <text start="327.49" dur="5.19">have been before during Obama and</text>
  <text start="330.43" dur="4.68">everything else they&amp;#39;re now going to cut</text>
  <text start="332.68" dur="5.54">rates this is going to be a clear signal</text>
  <text start="335.11" dur="6.06">that the Patriots are completely</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="4.42">controlling what the Fed does it at this</text>
  <text start="341.17" dur="4.08">point because you could see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="342.64" dur="5.97">doing doesn&amp;#39;t make sense with with the</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="5.61">with the data they&amp;#39;re receiving now we</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="3.99">need to go back to post 26:19 because</text>
  <text start="350.86" dur="5.25">this was during the question and answer</text>
  <text start="352.6" dur="7.98">and then it says do we have gold q says</text>
  <text start="356.11" dur="7.14">yes gold shall destroy the Fed now we</text>
  <text start="360.58" dur="5.79">need to understand why gold is going to</text>
  <text start="363.25" dur="5.01">destroy the Fed think about it central</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="4.71">banks around the world especially in</text>
  <text start="368.26" dur="7.29">this year they have been buying more</text>
  <text start="371.08" dur="5.84">gold than ever before here are some</text>
  <text start="375.55" dur="3.96">statistics from the World Gold Council</text>
  <text start="376.92" dur="5.59">the northern miner reports that central</text>
  <text start="379.51" dur="5.28">banks needed 51 tons in gold purchases</text>
  <text start="382.51" dur="4.2">the most since October 2018 when the</text>
  <text start="384.79" dur="3.35">increased gold held in central bank</text>
  <text start="386.71" dur="4.11">vaults by a hundred and five tons</text>
  <text start="388.14" dur="4.03">switching to ounces the miner states</text>
  <text start="390.82" dur="4.83">that the gold holding grew by a</text>
  <text start="392.17" dur="6.99">startling 2.9 million ounces in January</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="5.55">and February of 2019 verses 1.9 million</text>
  <text start="399.16" dur="5.19">ounces during the same period of 2018</text>
  <text start="401.2" dur="4.77">this is the highest level of gold buying</text>
  <text start="404.35" dur="3.51">by central bank since the first two</text>
  <text start="405.97" dur="5.82">months of 2008 during the financial</text>
  <text start="407.86" dur="5.37">crisis now think about why they are</text>
  <text start="411.79" dur="2.61">doing this right now we know that gold</text>
  <text start="413.23" dur="3.54">is being manipulated we know that</text>
  <text start="414.4" dur="4.17">someone through paper contracts at the</text>
  <text start="416.77" dur="3">gold price brought it down but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.57" dur="4.29">having a tougher and tougher time</text>
  <text start="419.77" dur="5.16">keeping the gold price down I do believe</text>
  <text start="422.86" dur="5.1">that this is being done on purpose now</text>
  <text start="424.93" dur="6.39">to allow governments around the world to</text>
  <text start="427.96" dur="4.169">purchase as much gold as they possibly</text>
  <text start="431.32" dur="1.919">can</text>
  <text start="432.129" dur="3.51">and of course they&amp;#39;re doing this through</text>
  <text start="433.239" dur="5.1">their central bank systems now if all</text>
  <text start="435.639" dur="5.52">these central banks have gold which</text>
  <text start="438.339" dur="4.41">really belongs to who the people of that</text>
  <text start="441.159" dur="3.33">country and this is why Italy&amp;#39;s fighting</text>
  <text start="442.749" dur="2.97">to get their gold back of course central</text>
  <text start="444.489" dur="2.82">bankers the private western central</text>
  <text start="445.719" dur="5.16">bankers I should say they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="447.309" dur="6.63">give up their gold but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.879" dur="5.82">accumulating a lot of gold right now if</text>
  <text start="453.939" dur="6.87">the world is accumulating gold and</text>
  <text start="456.699" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re preparing by holding gold what</text>
  <text start="460.809" dur="5.431">is going to bring down the Fed everyone</text>
  <text start="463.509" dur="8.01">holding gold think about what has</text>
  <text start="466.24" dur="9.12">happened here Trump his statistical</text>
  <text start="471.519" dur="5.46">numbers look amazing GDP increasing</text>
  <text start="475.36" dur="4.009">unemployment number all-time low</text>
  <text start="476.979" dur="4.79">manufacturers are coming back to the US</text>
  <text start="479.369" dur="7.871">regulations are being removed</text>
  <text start="481.769" dur="8.95">he&amp;#39;s reworking trade deals he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="5.999">introduce players into the Fed that are</text>
  <text start="490.719" dur="5.61">outside of the system now it might not</text>
  <text start="493.239" dur="5.49">be more it might not be cane but whoever</text>
  <text start="496.329" dur="3.69">he puts in their place they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="498.729" dur="3.6">mix things up</text>
  <text start="500.019" dur="7.83">why because Q has told us they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="502.329" dur="9.031">to restructure the Fed Basel 3 went live</text>
  <text start="507.849" dur="7.62">on March 29th which makes gold a Tier</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="8.609">one asset central banks and governments</text>
  <text start="515.469" dur="6.75">can now purchase all this gold countries</text>
  <text start="519.969" dur="5.161">are moving away from the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="522.219" dur="4.141">Note towards gold they want to make sure</text>
  <text start="525.13" dur="3.209">that they have gold because they</text>
  <text start="526.36" dur="6.87">understand that the Federal Reserve Note</text>
  <text start="528.339" dur="7.281">well it is dying countries fighting to</text>
  <text start="533.23" dur="6.18">get control of their gold look at Italy</text>
  <text start="535.62" dur="6.219">look at Venezuela look at other</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="6.919">countries that repatriated their gold</text>
  <text start="541.839" dur="8.521">Germany gold manipulation right now is</text>
  <text start="546.329" dur="8.891">continuing to allow countries to</text>
  <text start="550.36" dur="7.77">purchase gold this will end once the</text>
  <text start="555.22" dur="5.4">manipulation of gold ends it will then</text>
  <text start="558.13" dur="4.77">rise</text>
  <text start="560.62" dur="5.51">what happens when gold starts to rise</text>
  <text start="562.9" dur="5.61">well the dollar loses value the dollar</text>
  <text start="566.13" dur="4.93">which is the Federal Reserve Note will</text>
  <text start="568.51" dur="4.74">lose confidence around the world because</text>
  <text start="571.06" dur="4.89">right now it&amp;#39;s lost a lot of its value</text>
  <text start="573.25" dur="5.55">but once gold starts to rise people can</text>
  <text start="575.95" dur="6.06">see clearly what the dollar is really</text>
  <text start="578.8" dur="6.59">worth as the dollar loses confidence</text>
  <text start="582.01" dur="5.76">what happens to gold it gains confidence</text>
  <text start="585.39" dur="4.57">now this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the system is</text>
  <text start="587.77" dur="5.88">gonna be backed by gold but it could be</text>
  <text start="589.96" dur="7.41">a gold backed confidence builder where</text>
  <text start="593.65" dur="7.2">countries have gold the US I do believe</text>
  <text start="597.37" dur="4.47">that Q is Right gold is here in the</text>
  <text start="600.85" dur="3.27">United States</text>
  <text start="601.84" dur="5.7">other countries are ramping up their</text>
  <text start="604.12" dur="6.93">gold purchases they&amp;#39;re going to say we</text>
  <text start="607.54" dur="6.63">have the gold and the Fiat system well</text>
  <text start="611.05" dur="4.53">it is completely imploding on itself and</text>
  <text start="614.17" dur="3.3">they know it&amp;#39;s going to implode on</text>
  <text start="615.58" dur="6.33">itself because it&amp;#39;s a central bank</text>
  <text start="617.47" dur="7.32">system it is not designed to last in the</text>
  <text start="621.91" dur="5.37">long term it is only designed to last a</text>
  <text start="624.79" dur="4.32">certain period of time during this</text>
  <text start="627.28" dur="4.26">period of time the central bankers come</text>
  <text start="629.11" dur="5.49">in and they enslave the people</text>
  <text start="631.54" dur="6.42">they robbed the country of their assets</text>
  <text start="634.6" dur="6.9">and they take complete and utter control</text>
  <text start="637.96" dur="5.31">and then they have an event to cover up</text>
  <text start="641.5" dur="4.68">what is calling but this time they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="643.27" dur="6.48">have this event they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
