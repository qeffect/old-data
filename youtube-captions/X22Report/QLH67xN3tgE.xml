  <text start="827.34" dur="5.13">return three of them the next day and</text>
  <text start="829.41" dur="4.35">two on monday so right now the Islamic</text>
  <text start="832.47" dur="3.06">state the proxy army for United States</text>
  <text start="833.76" dur="4.74">government central bankers they do not</text>
  <text start="835.53" dur="4.59">hold the last oil field yes they would</text>
  <text start="838.5" dur="5.46">like to get their hands on it but they</text>
  <text start="840.12" dur="5.79">do not have it right now now Russia is</text>
  <text start="843.96" dur="4.71">coming out saying all this information</text>
  <text start="845.91" dur="6.18">about them fighting in Syria is complete</text>
  <text start="848.67" dur="7.56">and utter disinformation they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="852.09" dur="6.45">it is not true we do not have any jets</text>
  <text start="856.23" dur="5.27">flying in there we don&amp;#39;t have our troops</text>
  <text start="858.54" dur="7.83">in there fighting whatsoever we are</text>
  <text start="861.5" dur="7.89">giving Syria aid and it looks like that</text>
  <text start="866.37" dur="6.93">the u.s. government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="869.39" dur="6.73">continually pushing this continually</text>
  <text start="873.3" dur="5.1">trying to show that Russia is involved</text>
  <text start="876.12" dur="3.51">at this point because it looks like</text>
  <text start="878.4" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re going to be making their move</text>
  <text start="879.63" dur="4.8">into the mascus we see that everything</text>
  <text start="881.97" dur="4.29">is being set up and if it doesn&amp;#39;t go as</text>
  <text start="884.43" dur="4.62">planned they&amp;#39;re going to be saying that</text>
  <text start="886.26" dur="6.42">Russia stop them we&amp;#39;re at war with</text>
  <text start="889.05" dur="9.9">Russia and they&amp;#39;re building this up to</text>
  <text start="892.68" dur="8.37">convince everyone now Britain is saying</text>
  <text start="898.95" dur="5.01">that British troops could be deployed to</text>
  <text start="901.05" dur="5.73">Syria to help set up safe havens for the</text>
  <text start="903.96" dur="5.04">refugees so they&amp;#39;re going to bring in</text>
  <text start="906.78" dur="7.59">troops I&amp;#39;m going to be setting up safe</text>
  <text start="909" dur="7.05">havens in Syria for these refugees well</text>
  <text start="914.37" dur="4.32">we know what&amp;#39;s really happening they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="916.05" dur="5.34">going to be bringing in the troops maybe</text>
  <text start="918.69" dur="6.47">a small portion will be for the refugees</text>
  <text start="921.39" dur="6.63">the others will be going to fight Assad</text>
  <text start="925.16" dur="4.12">so this is a little trick they use to</text>
  <text start="928.02" dur="3.15">make everyone believe they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="929.28" dur="5.7">help the refugees they could care less</text>
  <text start="931.17" dur="8.94">about the refugees their main goal is to</text>
  <text start="934.98" dur="6.87">get Assad we see turkey invaded Iraq the</text>
  <text start="940.11" dur="3.9">Turkish ground troops entered northern</text>
  <text start="941.85" dur="4.95">Iraq on Tuesday as part of a short-term</text>
  <text start="944.01" dur="5.67">operation to capture Kurdish rebels who</text>
  <text start="946.8" dur="5.699">crossed the border after attacking and</text>
  <text start="949.68" dur="4.349">killing 16 soldiers</text>
  <text start="952.499" dur="4.11">the size of the operation was not</text>
  <text start="954.029" dur="4.71">immediately clear but they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="956.609" dur="6.96">that there was about two battalions that</text>
  <text start="958.739" dur="8.24">entered the northern Iraq area now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="963.569" dur="5.73">seen this before if we go back to 2008</text>
  <text start="966.979" dur="4.93">Turkish soldiers entered a rack in a</text>
  <text start="969.299" dur="7.65">similar effort to eradicate the PKK it</text>
  <text start="971.909" dur="10.23">was called Operation son we saw going</text>
  <text start="976.949" dur="11">back in 1995 operation steal 1997</text>
  <text start="982.139" dur="8.16">operation hammer and operation dawn and</text>
  <text start="987.949" dur="6.79">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this all along</text>
  <text start="990.299" dur="7.35">whenever they want to go in to Iraq they</text>
  <text start="994.739" dur="7.02">use an excuse when they want to go into</text>
  <text start="997.649" dur="7.26">Syria they use an excuse to bring troops</text>
  <text start="1001.759" dur="6.21">into the area and of course washington</text>
  <text start="1004.909" dur="4.74">says well yes the PKK is the enemy they</text>
  <text start="1007.969" dur="4.38">have every right to protect themselves</text>
  <text start="1009.649" dur="5.97">they have every right to go into a</text>
  <text start="1012.349" dur="6.45">sovereign country and bring military</text>
  <text start="1015.619" dur="7.32">assets and troops into the region no</text>
  <text start="1018.799" dur="7.71">they don&amp;#39;t but of course they pretend</text>
  <text start="1022.939" dur="7.59">they do now we see the Moscow stock</text>
  <text start="1026.509" dur="6.211">exchange was halted they&amp;#39;re saying it</text>
  <text start="1030.529" dur="4.8">was some type of virus or something and</text>
  <text start="1032.72" dur="3.78">the Moscow exchange was not going down</text>
  <text start="1035.329" dur="3.781">at that point actually was doing very</text>
  <text start="1036.5" dur="7.049">well and they went to their backup</text>
  <text start="1039.11" dur="7.219">systems to resume their trading so</text>
  <text start="1043.549" dur="6.151">something hit their markets to try to</text>
  <text start="1046.329" dur="7.361">bring them down I can&amp;#39;t imagine who it</text>
  <text start="1049.7" dur="6.15">was and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1053.69" dur="5.25">seeing a lot of these little attacks</text>
  <text start="1055.85" dur="6.12">here and there chemical plants stock</text>
  <text start="1058.94" dur="7.469">markets being hit viruses being planted</text>
  <text start="1061.97" dur="7.049">and we see right now the United States</text>
  <text start="1066.409" dur="6.75">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1069.019" dur="5.671">getting prepared for cyber war we know</text>
  <text start="1073.159" dur="4.411">if anyone attacks the United States</text>
  <text start="1074.69" dur="6.839">already the Pentagon says that any type</text>
  <text start="1077.57" dur="8.219">of cyber attack is an act of war which</text>
  <text start="1081.529" dur="7.38">can be handled with a physical attack</text>
  <text start="1085.789" dur="4.38">and we see at this point in time as the</text>
  <text start="1088.909" dur="2.911">US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1090.169" dur="5.58">continually provoked these countries</text>
  <text start="1091.82" dur="8.849">eventually a country will fight back</text>
  <text start="1095.749" dur="6.87">they will not sit and take it and this</text>
  <text start="1100.669" dur="6.96">is what they&amp;#39;re hoping for they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1102.619" dur="6.18">hoping a country lashes out doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1107.629" dur="4.831">matter which one it is because the</text>
  <text start="1108.799" dur="5.88">players are all the same and this will</text>
  <text start="1112.46" dur="6.209">kick off World War three we are headed</text>
  <text start="1114.679" dur="5.401">in this direction and the central banker</text>
  <text start="1118.669" dur="4.38">is the US government they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
