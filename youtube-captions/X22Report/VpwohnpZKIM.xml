  <text start="109.479" dur="7.431">in europe and we understand that greece</text>
  <text start="113.489" dur="7.961">nothing has changed there whatsoever</text>
  <text start="116.91" dur="6.54">greece completely remains crippled by</text>
  <text start="121.45" dur="4.919">unprecedented capital controls</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="7.27">preventing full access of the local</text>
  <text start="126.369" dur="7.861">population to their savings and right</text>
  <text start="130.72" dur="7.26">now the people are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="134.23" dur="7.05">that there&amp;#39;s no recovery coming their</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="5.72">country is doomed and these capital</text>
  <text start="141.28" dur="5.88">controls are not going away and</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="5.95">according to the latest Greece&amp;#39;s central</text>
  <text start="147.16" dur="8.31">bank data we&amp;#39;re seeing that the deposit</text>
  <text start="149.65" dur="10.41">outflows are continuing and people in</text>
  <text start="155.47" dur="5.91">Greece they&amp;#39;re not taking their funds</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="2.79">their money that they&amp;#39;re earning and</text>
  <text start="161.38" dur="2.66">placing it into the banks are actually</text>
  <text start="162.85" dur="3.449">taking them out</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="4.21">now the question is why are they doing</text>
  <text start="166.299" dur="4.17">this well they don&amp;#39;t trust what is</text>
  <text start="168.25" dur="5.969">happening in their country they realize</text>
  <text start="170.469" dur="5.97">that balance are coming they saw what</text>
  <text start="174.219" dur="4.02">happened in Cyprus and most of the</text>
  <text start="176.439" dur="3.841">people are saying you know something we</text>
  <text start="178.239" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t want to lose our funds we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="4.65">want to lose our hard-earned money and</text>
  <text start="182.109" dur="6.63">get it replaced with stock from a</text>
  <text start="184.93" dur="7.259">failing bank and they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="188.739" dur="6.301">unwilling to put their savings back into</text>
  <text start="192.189" dur="5.821">the banks and this is troubling the</text>
  <text start="195.04" dur="5.279">central bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="6.119">out a way to get people to bring back</text>
  <text start="200.319" dur="7.111">their currency and it&amp;#39;s just not working</text>
  <text start="204.129" dur="6.59">and we can see right now the local</text>
  <text start="207.43" dur="6.119">population they no longer believe a</text>
  <text start="210.719" dur="4.72">recovery is coming in their country and</text>
  <text start="213.549" dur="4.681">the question is how can they possibly</text>
  <text start="215.439" dur="6.121">believe anything is going to happen in</text>
  <text start="218.23" dur="6.39">their country except it collapse because</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="6.599">nothing has changed their the bailouts</text>
  <text start="224.62" dur="6.75">are continuing putting the country</text>
  <text start="228.159" dur="7.11">further and further into debt now out in</text>
  <text start="231.37" dur="6.63">the UK they are telling the retailer&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.269" dur="7.05">that they&amp;#39;re going to experience low a</text>
  <text start="238" dur="5.609">slower growth in 2016 and the reason</text>
  <text start="242.319" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;re saying this is not because of</text>
  <text start="243.609" dur="6">the economy because consumers are</text>
  <text start="246.31" dur="5.669">looking beyond retail for goods and</text>
  <text start="249.609" dur="4.44">services to spend their money on there</text>
  <text start="251.979" dur="3.21">looking in other places where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.049" dur="2.511">not where they&amp;#39;re going to spend their</text>
  <text start="255.189" dur="3.871">money they&amp;#39;re not going to spend it on</text>
  <text start="256.56" dur="4.239">services like going out to eat they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="259.06" dur="3.389">not going to spend it on retail they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="4.291">going to be spending it in other areas</text>
  <text start="262.449" dur="5.431">basically what they&amp;#39;re trying to say is</text>
  <text start="265.09" dur="4.59">the economy is falling apart people are</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="4.59">not going to be spending money in retail</text>
  <text start="269.68" dur="8.1">so don&amp;#39;t expect it and this is going to</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="9.09">get worse as time goes on and the first</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="6.33">day of the new year while as the stock</text>
  <text start="281.56" dur="6.27">market opens we see that it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="6.51">and utter disaster the market fell</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="4.53">during the day like 400 450 points of</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="4.019">course we had the high frequency traders</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="4.94">the plunge protection teams step in and</text>
  <text start="294.639" dur="6.081">push that market right back up to</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="5.519">a negative 270 or so points they did</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="6.599">whatever they possibly can to make it</text>
  <text start="302.819" dur="6.69">better to make it not as bad but don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="307.319" dur="4.081">worry they might be on the ball tomorrow</text>
  <text start="309.509" dur="4.291">they might be ready for what is coming</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="4.229">and they might be getting more free</text>
  <text start="313.8" dur="3.51">money from the Fed to really push the</text>
  <text start="315.629" dur="3.961">mark it up but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="317.31" dur="7.259">is that we haven&amp;#39;t seen something like</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="7.62">this since January fourth of 1932 where</text>
  <text start="324.569" dur="5.611">the market completely collapsed and fell</text>
  <text start="327.21" dur="6.6">apart and we are very close to that and</text>
  <text start="330.18" dur="5.01">if we look throughout the other years if</text>
  <text start="333.81" dur="4.46">we go back to nineteen thirty-two it was</text>
  <text start="335.19" dur="7.05">down by negative eight point one percent</text>
  <text start="338.27" dur="6.34">2016 we&amp;#39;re down negative 2.4% 1922 is</text>
  <text start="342.24" dur="5.04">negative two point three percent and</text>
  <text start="344.61" dur="4.91">even if we go back you know to 1983 it</text>
  <text start="347.28" dur="5.43">was negative one point eight percent and</text>
  <text start="349.52" dur="5.53">we can see at this point that this was a</text>
  <text start="352.71" dur="4.62">terrible terrible opening for the</text>
  <text start="355.05" dur="4.919">markets and we know the market is</text>
  <text start="357.33" dur="5.28">completely manipulated we know this</text>
  <text start="359.969" dur="5.221">doesn&amp;#39;t give us an indication of how the</text>
  <text start="362.61" dur="5.73">economy is doing this is for the central</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="6">bank this is for those people who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="368.34" dur="5.25">look anywhere else and the only place</text>
  <text start="371.19" dur="4.62">they look is stock market if it&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="5.34">they feel that everything is fine well</text>
  <text start="375.81" dur="4.74">that is the last indicator letting</text>
  <text start="378.93" dur="2.82">everyone know how the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="3.989">because the economy is already</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="5.19">collapsing it has collapsed and what</text>
  <text start="384.539" dur="5.521">we&amp;#39;ve learned and I talk about real</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="4.979">estate quite a bit and we know the</text>
  <text start="390.06" dur="5.539">government gives us this data you know</text>
  <text start="391.919" dur="7.74">new home sales construction spending</text>
  <text start="395.599" dur="6.43">existing home sales and we look through</text>
  <text start="399.659" dur="4.111">all the junk to find out what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="402.029" dur="2.911">going on of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="403.77" dur="4.139">the government is telling us that</text>
  <text start="404.94" dur="5">housing is in recovery this is what you</text>
  <text start="407.909" dur="4.111">can expect from this new recovery and</text>
  <text start="409.94" dur="4.029">I&amp;#39;ve been saying that housing prices</text>
  <text start="412.02" dur="4.59">have been coming down it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="413.969" dur="4.111">impossible for construction new</text>
  <text start="416.61" dur="3.779">construction to be happening the way</text>
  <text start="418.08" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s happening because we</text>
  <text start="420.389" dur="4.95">looked at the rail traffic of lumber it</text>
  <text start="423.15" dur="5.819">is completely down the demand for lumber</text>
  <text start="425.339" dur="6.271">is completely down and we come to find</text>
  <text start="428.969" dur="5.051">out the US Census</text>
  <text start="431.61" dur="5.92">released its latest November</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="7.5">construction spending data it quietly</text>
  <text start="437.53" dur="9.09">released it because there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="441.52" dur="8.22">wrong with it and they came out with it</text>
  <text start="446.62" dur="5.16">for November and it completely missed</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="4.26">expectations where they thought they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="451.78" dur="4.56">going to see construction spending rise</text>
  <text start="454" dur="9.15">two-point-six percent but it tumbled to</text>
  <text start="456.34" dur="10.77">negative 0.4% well that&amp;#39;s a Miss it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="463.15" dur="6.75">lot worse than they thought but we</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="5.79">realize something else went on with the</text>
  <text start="469.9" dur="6.15">report and in the fine print of the</text>
  <text start="472.9" dur="6.66">release the government made a rare</text>
  <text start="476.05" dur="5.01">admission and of course I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.56" dur="5.48">not all over the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.06" dur="6.63">not making a big deal of this that the</text>
  <text start="485.04" dur="9.97">construction spending data for the past</text>
  <text start="487.69" dur="11.1">10 years has been erroneous so basically</text>
  <text start="495.01" dur="8.04">what happened was is they had an error</text>
  <text start="498.79" dur="8.01">in their reporting and in the last 10</text>
  <text start="503.05" dur="6.21">years they&amp;#39;ve been giving us information</text>
  <text start="506.8" dur="5.549">that doesn&amp;#39;t reflect what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="509.26" dur="7.53">on in the economy so they went back and</text>
  <text start="512.349" dur="7.671">they revised all the numbers for</text>
  <text start="516.79" dur="6.66">construction spending and lo and behold</text>
  <text start="520.02" dur="6.31">guess what it&amp;#39;s a lot worse than we</text>
  <text start="523.45" dur="6">thought I mean those months where they</text>
  <text start="526.33" dur="7.35">said construction spending was up by</text>
  <text start="529.45" dur="6.84">four percent it was really 2.5% the</text>
  <text start="533.68" dur="6.63">places where they said it was up 1% it</text>
  <text start="536.29" dur="6.33">was zero percent and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="540.31" dur="7.53">graph and we look at the data we see</text>
  <text start="542.62" dur="10.71">that we are in a decline and in November</text>
  <text start="547.84" dur="9.03">we finally hit the negative territory so</text>
  <text start="553.33" dur="6.81">what does this tell us this tells us</text>
  <text start="556.87" dur="7.24">that the real estate market the</text>
  <text start="560.14" dur="8.79">construction spending is not</text>
  <text start="564.11" dur="6.93">good it tells us that this market is</text>
  <text start="568.93" dur="4.779">substantially lower than what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="6.66">reporting that it&amp;#39;s declining it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.709" dur="8.82">collapsing we&amp;#39;re not in a growing</text>
  <text start="577.7" dur="7.98">economy we&amp;#39;re in an economy that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="582.529" dur="6.481">shrinking so then they went back to new</text>
  <text start="585.68" dur="8.7">home sales where they quietly revised</text>
  <text start="589.01" dur="8.61">all those and it shows that we&amp;#39;re once</text>
  <text start="594.38" dur="5.79">again in a decline so we have existing</text>
  <text start="597.62" dur="7.26">home sales new home sales construction</text>
  <text start="600.17" dur="7.53">spending all declining now everything</text>
  <text start="604.88" dur="5.75">makes sense of why prices are coming</text>
  <text start="607.7" dur="5.16">down and we don&amp;#39;t see anyone purchasing</text>
  <text start="610.63" dur="5.05">because they&amp;#39;re telling us that prices</text>
  <text start="612.86" dur="5.43">are rising and existing home sales are</text>
  <text start="615.68" dur="5.63">falling but new construction is rising</text>
  <text start="618.29" dur="5.43">well actually it&amp;#39;s all declining and</text>
  <text start="621.31" dur="5.23">prices are coming down actually we saw</text>
  <text start="623.72" dur="5.34">this back in 2007 going into 2008 where</text>
  <text start="626.54" dur="5.43">everything started to slide together and</text>
  <text start="629.06" dur="8.31">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now so</text>
  <text start="631.97" dur="7.89">once again this economy is built on an</text>
  <text start="637.37" dur="4.38">illusion and they&amp;#39;re not going to go out</text>
  <text start="639.86" dur="4.05">there and say oh yes everything is much</text>
  <text start="641.75" dur="5.97">worse than it really is I mean we look</text>
  <text start="643.91" dur="7.01">at manufacturing the chicago PMI it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.72" dur="7.559">flashing red flashing lights that we are</text>
  <text start="650.92" dur="6.34">collapsing well today we get China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="655.279" dur="5.791">information about manufacturing PMI I</text>
  <text start="657.26" dur="6.06">mean that was terrible and then we got</text>
