  <text start="227.459" dur="5.25">here in the United States they thought</text>
  <text start="230.07" dur="4.86">they had it this is why Obama was out</text>
  <text start="232.709" dur="4.141">there and he was so confident that Trump</text>

  <text start="240.3" dur="5.4">unemployment lower that&amp;#39;s why he said he</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="5.7">would need a magic wand well Trump found</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="6.3">the magic wand and he&amp;#39;s using it now if</text>
  <text start="248.73" dur="6.87">we look at the job situation Trump is</text>
  <text start="252" dur="7.38">just not getting jobs for men or</text>
  <text start="255.6" dur="5.699">minorities he&amp;#39;s getting jobs for women</text>

  <text start="357.149" dur="3.69">is looking good he&amp;#39;ll be the best and</text>
  <text start="359.309" dur="4.051">most important trade deal ever made by</text>
  <text start="360.839" dur="5.16">the USA good for everybody farmers</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="4.949">manufacturers energy unions tremendous</text>
  <text start="365.999" dur="6.241">support importantly we&amp;#39;ll finally end</text>
  <text start="368.309" dur="6.93">our country&amp;#39;s worst trade deal NAFTA now</text>
  <text start="372.24" dur="5.789">Nancy Pelosi as we know she is pushing</text>
  <text start="375.239" dur="7.59">the impeachment against Trump and she</text>
  <text start="378.029" dur="8.94">held on to NAFTA until the right moment</text>
  <text start="382.829" dur="6.69">to make her party look good and of</text>
  <text start="386.969" dur="5.55">course she&amp;#39;s spinning it making it seem</text>
  <text start="389.519" dur="5.01">like this is her trade deal that oh we</text>
  <text start="392.519" dur="4.77">we work some parts of it and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.529" dur="5.21">even better no this was Trump&amp;#39;s trade</text>
  <text start="397.289" dur="4.58">deal he&amp;#39;s the one that negotiated it</text>
  <text start="399.739" dur="5.17">Trump team tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="401.869" dur="5.02">Nancy Pelosi says that US MCA is much</text>
  <text start="404.909" dur="3.9">better than after none of this would</text>
  <text start="406.889" dur="6.18">have ever been possible without the</text>
  <text start="408.809" dur="6.181">leadership of President Trump drawn</text>
  <text start="413.069" dur="3.99">strike tweeted out watching the</text>
  <text start="414.99" dur="4.449">Democrats roll out the end of their</text>
  <text start="417.059" dur="4.12">house impeachment force by revealing</text>
  <text start="419.439" dur="4.05">these two articles of impeachment and</text>
  <text start="421.179" dur="5.34">then announcing a deal on the u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="423.489" dur="5.311">and trying to claim this is our trade</text>
  <text start="426.519" dur="5.82">deal not Trump&amp;#39;s is the most</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="7.049">hysterically funny thing ever and like</text>
  <text start="432.339" dur="6.51">we said Nancy Pelosi was holding back</text>
  <text start="435.849" dur="5.97">and waiting for the right moment to</text>
  <text start="438.849" dur="4.8">present this she needed something to</text>
  <text start="441.819" dur="5.1">make it look like they were getting</text>
  <text start="443.649" dur="5.91">things done but she fell into the trap</text>
  <text start="446.919" dur="6.9">this is exactly what Trump wanted her to</text>
  <text start="449.559" dur="7.02">do remember he had the President of</text>
  <text start="453.819" dur="5.13">Mexico say it all looks good let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="456.579" dur="3.781">this done he put pressure on them</text>
  <text start="458.949" dur="4.44">everyone wanted it</text>
  <text start="460.36" dur="6.75">why was she stalling and the question is</text>
  <text start="463.389" dur="6.59">why does Trump need this so badly this</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="7.319">is another piece of the puzzle</text>
  <text start="469.979" dur="6.19">so this u.s. MCA this Agreement makes an</text>
  <text start="474.429" dur="5.52">economic manufacturing partnership</text>
  <text start="476.169" dur="6.6">between US and Mexico for assembly</text>
  <text start="479.949" dur="5.07">products third parties will have to</text>
  <text start="482.769" dur="5.52">produce parts an origination material</text>
  <text start="485.019" dur="6.9">within the US and Mexico here&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="488.289" dur="8.011">example in the auto sector the new US</text>
  <text start="491.919" dur="7.59">MCA Agreement require 75% of automobile</text>
  <text start="496.3" dur="6.06">parts made in North America and 45% must</text>
  <text start="499.509" dur="6.18">come from plants within minimum labor</text>
  <text start="502.36" dur="6.269">costs $16 per hour or faced higher upon</text>
  <text start="505.689" dur="5.94">export to the US additionally the total</text>
  <text start="508.629" dur="5.76">source origination rate of 75 percent us</text>
  <text start="511.629" dur="5.79">MCA product is higher than everyone</text>
  <text start="514.389" dur="5.221">thought possible this seventy five</text>
  <text start="517.419" dur="4.711">percent country-of-origin level was</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="4.68">possible because Trump cut out the</text>
  <text start="522.13" dur="4.62">corporation&amp;#39;s US Chamber of Commerce</text>
  <text start="524.29" dur="5.01">from having any influence over the</text>
  <text start="526.75" dur="4.86">agreement most people probably don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="529.3" dur="4.8">know but the u.s. MCA was the first</text>
  <text start="531.61" dur="5">first trade deal negotiated without</text>
  <text start="534.1" dur="5.7">multinational corporations in the room</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="6.43">so why is this so important well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.8" dur="7.5">take for example a German automaker like</text>
  <text start="543.04" dur="6.299">BMW and BMW recently built a two billion</text>
  <text start="547.3" dur="5.17">assembly plant in Mexico just came</text>
  <text start="549.339" dur="5.291">online most of their core parts were</text>
  <text start="552.47" dur="5.76">coming from the EU steel aluminum</text>
  <text start="554.63" dur="5.6">casting components and we had some</text>
  <text start="558.23" dur="5.67">coming from Asia which was electronics</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="8.83">now the assembly plant will have to</text>
  <text start="563.9" dur="10.32">source 75% of the auto parts from where</text>
  <text start="569.06" dur="8.97">the US and Mexico with 45% of those</text>
  <text start="574.22" dur="7.08">parts from facilities paying 16 dollars</text>
  <text start="578.03" dur="5.73">an hour the result BMW will need to</text>
  <text start="581.3" dur="6.42">modify their supply chain and build auto</text>
  <text start="583.76" dur="7.2">parts in the US and Mexico the new u.s.</text>
  <text start="587.72" dur="5.64">MCA closes the NAFTA loophole and blocks</text>
  <text start="590.96" dur="5.69">Canada from brokering their their</text>
  <text start="593.36" dur="8.67">assembly process access to the US market</text>
  <text start="596.65" dur="9.15">Trump by pushing this us us MCA forward</text>
  <text start="602.03" dur="6.66">is going to make North America a</text>
  <text start="605.8" dur="6.75">manufacturing powerhouse it will give</text>
  <text start="608.69" dur="6.21">him additional leverage against China</text>
  <text start="612.55" dur="4.03">you think tariffs are the only leverage</text>
  <text start="614.9" dur="5.25">that he&amp;#39;s going to be using against the</text>
  <text start="616.58" dur="6.6">globalist system no now he has the</text>
  <text start="620.15" dur="5.67">backing of manufacturing and what else</text>
  <text start="623.18" dur="5.7">does this give him it gives him a</text>
  <text start="625.82" dur="5.73">manufacturing base so when we transition</text>
  <text start="628.88" dur="7.68">into the new economic system we can</text>
  <text start="631.55" dur="8.43">produce products where we can then trade</text>
  <text start="636.56" dur="5.57">with other countries remember the petro</text>
  <text start="639.98" dur="6.27">dollar system is going to go away</text>
  <text start="642.13" dur="6.67">countries will not trade in their petrol</text>
  <text start="646.25" dur="5.16">dollar and purchase and I mean the</text>
  <text start="648.8" dur="6.57">Federal Reserve Note and purchase u.s.</text>
  <text start="651.41" dur="7.4">goods we will now have trade with all</text>
  <text start="655.37" dur="10.31">these countries we will now produce</text>
  <text start="658.81" dur="11.29">items and we will then import an export</text>
  <text start="665.68" dur="8.38">today we really don&amp;#39;t have that actually</text>
  <text start="670.1" dur="8.19">it&amp;#39;s one-sided Trump has been resetting</text>
  <text start="674.06" dur="7.79">all the trade deals and this needed to</text>
  <text start="678.29" dur="8.03">happen this is all part of the plan</text>
  <text start="681.85" dur="8.21">the US with this new deal is becoming</text>
  <text start="686.32" dur="6.18">more and more powerful economically</text>
  <text start="690.06" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;re going to have a manufacturing base</text>
  <text start="692.5" dur="6.24">because Trump and the Patriots they knew</text>
  <text start="694.41" dur="6.7">we didn&amp;#39;t have time to bring back every</text>
  <text start="698.74" dur="5.04">single manufacturer that was pushed out</text>
  <text start="701.11" dur="4.25">of the United States it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="703.78" dur="4.56">impossibility</text>
  <text start="705.36" dur="5.47">they took years to do this Trump was</text>
  <text start="708.34" dur="5.19">gonna do this in two three years it</text>
  <text start="710.83" dur="5.94">couldn&amp;#39;t happen yes he&amp;#39;s been pushing</text>
  <text start="713.53" dur="6.9">with tariffs many companies out of China</text>
  <text start="716.77" dur="6.75">some came back to the US but he needed a</text>
  <text start="720.43" dur="6.3">way so we could become a manufacturing</text>
  <text start="723.52" dur="8.52">powerhouse once again and he figured it</text>
  <text start="726.73" dur="7.89">out and once we transition and once we</text>
  <text start="732.04" dur="4.68">get rid of the central bank once we get</text>
  <text start="734.62" dur="3.96">rid of all of that more and more</text>
  <text start="736.72" dur="6.48">companies over time will come back to</text>
  <text start="738.58" dur="6.93">the u.s. NAFTA will no longer really be</text>
  <text start="743.2" dur="7.2">needed I&amp;#39;m sure how we negotiate this</text>
  <text start="745.51" dur="7.08">once again or whoever comes in next but</text>
  <text start="750.4" dur="6.06">the point is it was to give the Patriots</text>
