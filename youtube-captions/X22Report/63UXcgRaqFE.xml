  <text start="89.67" dur="3.63">million dollars which is not really a</text>
  <text start="91.59" dur="4.17">lot of money because what they were</text>

  <text start="130.86" dur="6.3">hide their actions from the regulator&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="134.81" dur="5.2">goldman traders made little effort to</text>
  <text start="137.16" dur="5.43">disguise what they were doing and they</text>
  <text start="140.01" dur="4.59">were just out there doing it now of</text>
  <text start="142.59" dur="5.22">course they paid this little tiny</text>
  <text start="144.6" dur="5.28">hundred million 20 million dollar but we</text>
  <text start="147.81" dur="5.13">can see right now what they were doing</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="5.61">they made billions and billions off of</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="4.32">this and actually when other banks look</text>
  <text start="155.49" dur="3.57">at this saying hey this is actually</text>
  <text start="157.26" dur="3.42">worth it if we go ahead and we</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="4.53">manipulate like the precious metals</text>
  <text start="160.68" dur="5.37">market the LIBOR market the US dollar</text>
  <text start="163.59" dur="4.52">market all we have to do is pay these</text>
  <text start="166.05" dur="5.4">small fines but we can make billions off</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="5.2">of doing this so this really is not</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="4.35">stopping the banks from manipulating and</text>
  <text start="173.31" dur="5.64">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="175.8" dur="5.48">central banks the banking system the</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="6.5">whole entire thing is completely</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="8.58">corrupt we see the Bank of Japan well</text>
  <text start="185.45" dur="7.32">the Bank of Japan their etf purchases</text>
  <text start="189.86" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re going to top 4.3 billion yen</text>
  <text start="192.77" dur="5.7">this year that&amp;#39;s thirty six point five</text>
  <text start="195.35" dur="6.63">billion dollars up forty percent from</text>
  <text start="198.47" dur="5.46">2015 last year the central bank board</text>
  <text start="201.98" dur="4.74">then bought more than three trillion yen</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="4.41">worth of ETFs the data was released by</text>
  <text start="206.72" dur="4.65">the bank of japan and compiled by the</text>
  <text start="208.34" dur="7.47">tokyo stock exchange should it continue</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="8.089">at this rate in a few years the bank of</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="7.56">japan will have nationalized the entire</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="7.211">market as of this moment it owns about</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="7.07">2.5 percent of the market cap and we can</text>
  <text start="226.67" dur="9.539">see right now that they are doing this</text>
  <text start="230.44" dur="8.11">to control the stock market because if</text>
  <text start="236.209" dur="5.401">they don&amp;#39;t this system comes down</text>
  <text start="238.55" dur="5.88">actually we see this happening in other</text>
  <text start="241.61" dur="5.46">places like Europe they want to do it</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="5.07">here in the United States but of course</text>
  <text start="247.07" dur="4.979">under the laws it doesn&amp;#39;t allow them to</text>
  <text start="249.5" dur="4.2">do this but they are allowed to take the</text>
  <text start="252.049" dur="3.481">free money that is created by the Fed</text>
  <text start="253.7" dur="6.3">pass it along to the banks and have the</text>
  <text start="255.53" dur="8.37">banks go ahead and purchase stocks now</text>
  <text start="260" dur="6.289">the Bank of Japan they were one of the</text>
  <text start="263.9" dur="5.66">biggest buyers of stocks right now and</text>
  <text start="266.289" dur="5.831">normally you would see this in a</text>
  <text start="269.56" dur="5.85">centrally planned economy such as like</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="6.63">the USSR but now we&amp;#39;re seeing it in</text>
  <text start="275.41" dur="7.42">Japan in Europe and soon most likely</text>
  <text start="278.75" dur="5.19">once this system comes down and remember</text>
  <text start="282.83" dur="3.27">I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to come down</text>
  <text start="283.94" dur="3.99">and just stay down I think they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="286.1" dur="3.42">to pump it back up the Fed is going to</text>
  <text start="287.93" dur="4.91">come in and say listen we need</text>
  <text start="289.52" dur="9.12">additional laws we need additional help</text>
  <text start="292.84" dur="7.81">here so we need the ability to create</text>
  <text start="298.64" dur="4.98">more currency out of thin air we need</text>
  <text start="300.65" dur="4.41">the ability to purchase stocks and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="303.62" dur="2.76">said this in the past that I believe</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="5.099">that this is going to be a two-phase</text>
  <text start="306.38" dur="7.83">type of class collapse scenario where</text>
  <text start="310.159" dur="7.801">the system comes down it drops down and</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="6.66">the central bank the elite they make</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="5.01">their case of listen you want us to help</text>
  <text start="320.87" dur="4.74">here well this is what we need we need</text>
  <text start="322.97" dur="4.349">more control of the system we need to</text>
  <text start="325.61" dur="4.11">create currency and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="327.319" dur="4.35">prop the system up once again but we</text>
  <text start="329.72" dur="4.11">know this is not going to hold it will</text>
  <text start="331.669" dur="4.141">only hold for a little while but what</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="4.95">allows them to do is take more control</text>
  <text start="335.81" dur="4.53">of the system and then eventually the</text>
  <text start="338.78" dur="4.139">whole thing will collapse so when you</text>
  <text start="340.34" dur="4.65">see that you know we are heading towards</text>
  <text start="342.919" dur="5.22">that period of a total collapse scenario</text>
  <text start="344.99" dur="6.179">now we see out in Germany the Bundesbank</text>
  <text start="348.139" dur="5.34">there repatriating their gold from New</text>
  <text start="351.169" dur="4.62">York in Paris and they plan to</text>
  <text start="353.479" dur="6.331">repatriate their gold and have it all</text>
  <text start="355.789" dur="7.021">done by 2020 now very interestingly they</text>
  <text start="359.81" dur="5.46">decided to accelerate this where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="7.8">bringing in more gold at a faster clip</text>
  <text start="365.27" dur="7.41">and back in twenty twelve people had</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="4.35">their doubts that limit Germany might</text>
  <text start="372.68" dur="4.169">not even have their gold so they went</text>
  <text start="374.96" dur="5.04">and they said listen we need to bring</text>
  <text start="376.849" dur="5.551">the goal back we want to undertake and</text>
  <text start="380" dur="6.63">audit to make sure that all a gold is</text>
  <text start="382.4" dur="6.57">accounted for and what happened was gold</text>
  <text start="386.63" dur="4.65">started to trickle in people were saying</text>
  <text start="388.97" dur="3.99">well do we really have this gold and</text>
  <text start="391.28" dur="3.03">they said well don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="392.96" dur="4.44">because we&amp;#39;re going to have all this</text>
  <text start="394.31" dur="5.99">gold brought back by 2020 and then all</text>
  <text start="397.4" dur="5.9">of a sudden for unknown reasons they</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="6.01">decided to accelerate this plan and</text>
  <text start="403.3" dur="6.429">bring in the gold much sooner than that</text>
  <text start="406.31" dur="5.31">and it looks like in the year of 2017</text>
  <text start="409.729" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re going to try to bring most of it</text>
  <text start="411.62" dur="4.859">back to Germany now the question is why</text>
  <text start="414.349" dur="4.591">are they doing this right now why are</text>
  <text start="416.479" dur="4.861">they pushing it so hard do they know</text>
  <text start="418.94" dur="5.25">something that we don&amp;#39;t well we kind of</text>
  <text start="421.34" dur="4.23">do it looks like what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="424.19" dur="3.479">they&amp;#39;re bringing all the goal back</text>
  <text start="425.57" dur="5.099">because they&amp;#39;re preparing for some type</text>
  <text start="427.669" dur="6.421">of economic crisis and they want their</text>
  <text start="430.669" dur="5.191">gold their physical gold on hand and we</text>
  <text start="434.09" dur="4.889">can see right now that they were</text>
  <text start="435.86" dur="6.45">planning on bringing back seventeen</text>
  <text start="438.979" dur="6.87">hundred tons of gold in the next three</text>
  <text start="442.31" dur="5.84">years but in the year of 2016 they</text>
  <text start="445.849" dur="6.211">brought in sixteen hundred tons</text>
  <text start="448.15" dur="5.32">just in this year so when we look at</text>
  <text start="452.06" dur="4.83">this we can see they&amp;#39;re way ahead of</text>
  <text start="453.47" dur="6.93">schedule and it looks like they are</text>
  <text start="456.89" dur="6.33">preparing for this economic crisis which</text>
