  <text start="112.86" dur="5.43">has uncovered what appears to be proof</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="4.41">that the FBI was investigating the</text>

  <text start="162.15" dur="6">weeks after the criminal probe began the</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="4.739">FBI sent notices to every agency</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="4.35">involved in the Iranian one approval</text>
  <text start="169.829" dur="6.421">process to preserve records now this is</text>
  <text start="172.5" dur="5.97">huge five days after the initial request</text>
  <text start="176.25" dur="4.739">the same FBI agent sent another round of</text>

  <text start="210.54" dur="4.86">dishonest not to see the very likely</text>
  <text start="212.939" dur="4.951">attachment of the special agents action</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="5.28">that is to say that an FBI probe</text>
  <text start="217.89" dur="5.31">originating as an outcome of information</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="4.5">retrieved in parallel to the timing of</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="4.74">the criminal probe of Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="225.18" dur="5.309">Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s email use so while the</text>
  <text start="227.94" dur="4.53">FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="230.489" dur="5.551">was sold as a simple matter of</text>
  <text start="232.47" dur="7.049">mishandling of classified material</text>
  <text start="236.04" dur="5.61">we now have proof that the FBI set their</text>
  <text start="239.519" dur="4.17">sights on the uranium one scandal weeks</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="4.38">after that began looking into Hillary</text>
  <text start="243.689" dur="4.86">Clinton&amp;#39;s emails we also know that the</text>
  <text start="246.03" dur="3.75">five FBI field offices and the IRS have</text>
  <text start="248.549" dur="3.631">been investigating the Clinton</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="4.889">Foundation on accusations of pay-to-play</text>
  <text start="252.18" dur="4.589">and other criminal acts and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.669" dur="3.87">starting to see from all the information</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="3.27">that&amp;#39;s coming out we&amp;#39;re getting more and</text>
  <text start="258.539" dur="4.38">more information on what is really going</text>
  <text start="260.039" dur="5.491">on here now the FBI has turned over a</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="5.011">hundreds of pages of new Clinton probe</text>
  <text start="265.53" dur="4.859">documents and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="5.76">really starting to build now on the case</text>
  <text start="270.389" dur="6.361">of the Trump dossier McCain&amp;#39;s aide who</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="4.409">handled the Trump dossier who&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="276.75" dur="4.08">subpoenaed well actually he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="278.099" dur="4.771">dodging the subpoena well he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="4.769">want to get involved and he doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="4.979">to talk about the dossier whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="285.599" dur="4.621">he&amp;#39;s continually dodging the subpoena</text>
  <text start="287.849" dur="4.531">now we can see why he is doing this</text>
  <text start="290.22" dur="3.84">because this would implicate him it</text>
  <text start="292.38" dur="3.599">would implicate McCain and it would</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="4.44">bring out a lot more information so the</text>
  <text start="295.979" dur="5.341">best plan is not to say anything and</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="5.55">dodge the subpoena and we can see that</text>
  <text start="301.32" dur="4.86">we have the Cabal on one end where</text>
  <text start="304.05" dur="3.869">they&amp;#39;re pushing their their objective</text>
  <text start="306.18" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re saying that they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="4.47">information about Flynn and Flynn&amp;#39;s son</text>
  <text start="310.26" dur="5.519">and they and Mueller has enough</text>
  <text start="312.389" dur="5.761">information to go ahead and indict Flynn</text>
  <text start="315.779" dur="4.351">and his son and again if they have all</text>
  <text start="318.15" dur="2.61">this information why didn&amp;#39;t they just do</text>
  <text start="320.13" dur="1.8">it</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="2.34">why does it have to come out in the news</text>
  <text start="321.93" dur="3.63">first because they&amp;#39;re saying oh another</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="6.33">leak here why didn&amp;#39;t they just push</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="6.99">their investigation and go forward with</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="5.31">what they have there&amp;#39;s no reason to leak</text>
  <text start="332.55" dur="3.51">this information if they have so much of</text>
  <text start="334.74" dur="3.84">it but we&amp;#39;ll see what happens</text>
  <text start="336.06" dur="4.41">in the next couple of days we see the</text>
  <text start="338.58" dur="4.68">Catalan leader while he&amp;#39;s turning</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="6.3">himself in to Belgian police and there</text>
  <text start="343.26" dur="5.46">are other four ministers who are also</text>
  <text start="346.77" dur="4.14">turning themselves in into the Belgian</text>
  <text start="348.72" dur="4.62">authorities to start the process of</text>
  <text start="350.91" dur="5.22">their possible extradition to Spain and</text>
  <text start="353.34" dur="6.54">we see right now that they are pushing</text>
  <text start="356.13" dur="5.66">hard to put this whole thing to rest</text>
  <text start="359.88" dur="3.6">here where listen there&amp;#39;s going to be no</text>
  <text start="361.79" dur="4.75">independence there&amp;#39;s going to be no</text>
  <text start="363.48" dur="5.28">movement whatsoever and catalonia is not</text>
  <text start="366.54" dur="3.48">going to be doing anything and once</text>
  <text start="368.76" dur="3.63">again we&amp;#39;ll have to watch to see how</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="5.19">this all plays out but it looks like the</text>
  <text start="372.39" dur="5.79">establishment is saying absolutely not</text>
  <text start="375.21" dur="5.49">you cannot push for independence we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.18" dur="4.95">not going to let it happen we see Trump</text>
  <text start="380.7" dur="5.78">is it is out in Asia right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.13" dur="6.96">landing in Japan and he is out there</text>
  <text start="386.48" dur="6.55">talking about North Korea and we need to</text>
  <text start="390.09" dur="5.37">understand what might happen at this</text>
  <text start="393.03" dur="4.47">point because we know that the South</text>
  <text start="395.46" dur="4.47">Korean news agency which is really the</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="5.1">corporate media which is controlled by</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="4.38">the Cabal they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea that</text>
  <text start="402.6" dur="4.32">North Korea is getting ready for another</text>
  <text start="404.31" dur="5.94">test now I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if a</text>
  <text start="406.92" dur="6.78">missile or something maybe flies near</text>
  <text start="410.25" dur="6.69">Japan and they push this into something</text>
  <text start="413.7" dur="5.16">bigger than it really is and I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="4.95">be surprised if there&amp;#39;s maybe some type</text>
  <text start="418.86" dur="7.07">of an event while Trump is out in Asia</text>
  <text start="421.89" dur="7.05">to try to push this war because remember</text>
  <text start="425.93" dur="5.98">what do we have going on right now we</text>
  <text start="428.94" dur="4.29">have Syria where that is a dead end for</text>
  <text start="431.91" dur="3.18">the Cabal unless they have some major</text>
  <text start="433.23" dur="4.17">major event because we see Russia and</text>
  <text start="435.09" dur="6.09">Syria it&amp;#39;s just a matter of weeks before</text>
  <text start="437.4" dur="7.41">the Cabal is out of that area Iraq</text>
  <text start="441.18" dur="5.73">Lebanon Libya Sudan Somalia all falling</text>
  <text start="444.81" dur="4.23">apart for the Cabal all they have left</text>
  <text start="446.91" dur="4.32">is to push war with Iran which I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="449.04" dur="4.38">think is going to work the other thing</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="3.11">they have is North Korea and if they can</text>
  <text start="453.42" dur="3.38">have or</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="5.25">some type an event with Trump out in</text>
  <text start="456.8" dur="5.88">this area where it looks like Kim</text>
  <text start="459.59" dur="5.67">jong-un is aiming for him and of course</text>
  <text start="462.68" dur="5.52">they can make this happen this is</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="6">something where they can push something</text>
  <text start="468.2" dur="5.13">much much larger like trying to get the</text>
  <text start="471.26" dur="4.86">u.s. into war with North Korea or to</text>
  <text start="473.33" dur="4.08">invade North Korea and this is something</text>
  <text start="476.12" dur="3.75">that we need to watch and we can see</text>
  <text start="477.41" dur="5.13">right now that Trump is visiting Japan</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="4.41">and during his tour he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="482.54" dur="3.78">most likely he&amp;#39;s going to meet with</text>
  <text start="484.28" dur="4.92">Putin to talk about what is happening</text>
  <text start="486.32" dur="4.47">with North Korea China Russia and the</text>
  <text start="489.2" dur="4.53">rest and I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="490.79" dur="6.78">talks behind the scenes because we know</text>
  <text start="493.73" dur="5.34">what Russia China Trump and many others</text>
  <text start="497.57" dur="3.75">are really trying to do there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="499.07" dur="4.2">not trying to wage war they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="501.32" dur="3.54">calm the situation down they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="503.27" dur="3.36">to have peace and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="3.81">using the back channels this is why</text>
  <text start="506.63" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;ve been doing it in private and I</text>
  <text start="508.67" dur="3.84">believe we have Tillerson and Trump</text>
  <text start="510.08" dur="4.26">playing good cop bad cop to keep the</text>
  <text start="512.51" dur="5.1">corporate media spinning thinking that</text>
  <text start="514.34" dur="5.28">we are headed towards war we also see</text>
  <text start="517.61" dur="4.29">something very interesting happening</text>
  <text start="519.62" dur="5.01">that we haven&amp;#39;t seen since 2011 now we</text>
  <text start="521.9" dur="4.11">understand out in Syria Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="524.63" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;ve been clearing the paid Merson a</text>
  <text start="526.01" dur="4.35">which is the Islamic state al Qaeda they</text>
  <text start="528.56" dur="4.74">have no chance at this point there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.36" dur="4.98">just a matter of weeks before the entire</text>
  <text start="533.3" dur="5.16">country is completely liberated from</text>
  <text start="535.34" dur="5.97">these terrorist groups now we have a US</text>
  <text start="538.46" dur="4.98">official which is now traveling to</text>
  <text start="541.31" dur="3.84">Damascus it&amp;#39;s an unnamed official right</text>
  <text start="543.44" dur="5.66">now nobody&amp;#39;s talking about who it really</text>
  <text start="545.15" dur="7.34">is and they&amp;#39;re going to be meeting with</text>
  <text start="549.1" dur="7.6">serious national security chief in</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="8.08">Damascus now this hasn&amp;#39;t been done since</text>
  <text start="556.7" dur="6.69">the start of the civil war in 2011 where</text>
  <text start="560.57" dur="4.8">they were talking to Syria the</text>
  <text start="563.39" dur="4.98">government of Syria saying listen</text>
  <text start="565.37" dur="5.19">there&amp;#39;s going to be an uprising you need</text>
  <text start="568.37" dur="3.66">to let these people join the government</text>
  <text start="570.56" dur="3.24">because eventually what they wanted to</text>
  <text start="572.03" dur="3.69">happen is we&amp;#39;re going to have these</text>
  <text start="573.8" dur="3.57">individuals join the government and they</text>
  <text start="575.72" dur="3.09">were going to get rid of Assad because</text>
  <text start="577.37" dur="4.62">Assad wouldn&amp;#39;t allow the pipeline</text>
  <text start="578.81" dur="5.34">through his country so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="581.99" dur="5.16">right now is since the United States is</text>
  <text start="584.15" dur="7.17">on the losing end the Cabal</text>
  <text start="587.15" dur="7.25">the US is now talking to Damascus now</text>
  <text start="591.32" dur="7.92">because as we know in a couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="594.4" dur="7.39">Syria Russia they&amp;#39;re going to ask the US</text>
  <text start="599.24" dur="5.58">and the coalition to leave the country</text>
  <text start="601.79" dur="6.049">and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="604.82" dur="5.79">and what happens out in Damascus and</text>
  <text start="607.839" dur="5.801">once again we see that things are</text>
  <text start="610.61" dur="5.82">definitely changing because now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="613.64" dur="5.61">meeting with the government of Syria</text>
  <text start="616.43" dur="4.56">once again so they&amp;#39;re already confirming</text>
  <text start="619.25" dur="4.2">that they are the government because</text>
  <text start="620.99" dur="4.38">since 2011 all this time</text>
  <text start="623.45" dur="3.81">they really didn&amp;#39;t want to meet with</text>
  <text start="625.37" dur="4.53">these individuals they didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="627.26" dur="4.29">meet with them they said Assad is not a</text>
  <text start="629.9" dur="4.2">leader he&amp;#39;s not really the government</text>
  <text start="631.55" dur="5.55">and they denounced him over and over and</text>
  <text start="634.1" dur="5.64">over very interestingly bin Laden&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="637.1" dur="5.04">Declassified files they just vanished</text>
  <text start="639.74" dur="3.78">from the CIA website a collection of</text>
