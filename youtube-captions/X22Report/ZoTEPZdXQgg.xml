  <text start="71.979" dur="4.891">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="73.72" dur="5.55">geopolitical news now just today Trump</text>
  <text start="76.87" dur="6.03">was out there with another tweet storm</text>
  <text start="79.27" dur="5.87">and he pretty much said that he wish he</text>
  <text start="82.9" dur="4.65">didn&amp;#39;t pick sessions as attorney general</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="3.82">the president had asked sessions to</text>
  <text start="87.55" dur="3.42">reverse his decision that recused</text>
  <text start="88.96" dur="5.09">himself from overseeing the Russian</text>
  <text start="90.97" dur="6.63">investigation so he wanted him to</text>
  <text start="94.05" dur="5.26">reverse his decision and this brings us</text>
  <text start="97.6" dur="4.56">back to a cute post which is very</text>
  <text start="99.31" dur="6.419">interesting because this is a cute post</text>
  <text start="102.16" dur="5.43">that was made on May 21st and basically</text>
  <text start="105.729" dur="5.03">it says rod Rosen seemed accused fired</text>
  <text start="107.59" dur="8.13">who has direct oversight over Mueller</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="7.451">sessions on recuse or number three until</text>
  <text start="115.72" dur="5.88">refill who&amp;#39;s number three</text>
  <text start="118.21" dur="4.68">Rachel Bren and she was like oh of</text>
  <text start="121.6" dur="4.4">course the corporate media saying that</text>
  <text start="122.89" dur="6.86">she decided to leave to take another job</text>
  <text start="126" dur="8.049">so right now I think what Trump is doing</text>

  <text start="137.799" dur="5.431">three position is going to be filled now</text>
  <text start="141.489" dur="4.53">I think this is the beginning stages of</text>
  <text start="143.23" dur="4.68">it and I think this is where this most</text>
  <text start="146.019" dur="3.991">likely is headed remember throughout the</text>
  <text start="147.91" dur="4.44">all these posts it&amp;#39;s saying trust</text>
  <text start="150.01" dur="4.11">sessions trust and he went on through</text>
  <text start="152.35" dur="3.69">the whole list q1 on through the whole</text>
  <text start="154.12" dur="4.73">list and told us who to trust and who</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="6.33">not to trust and now we see that the</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="6.22">inspector general&amp;#39;s report is coming out</text>
  <text start="162.37" dur="4.83">chairman chuck grassley of the senate</text>

  <text start="170.35" dur="5.31">the inspector general&amp;#39;s first report and</text>
  <text start="172.92" dur="4.33">this is decisions regarding 2016</text>
  <text start="175.66" dur="3.99">presidential election and this is</text>
  <text start="177.25" dur="6.599">supposed to be happening on Tuesday June</text>
  <text start="179.65" dur="6.78">5th at 10:00 a.m. now we understand</text>
  <text start="183.849" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s a lot more in this report</text>
  <text start="186.43" dur="6.199">and phase one of the Inspector General&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.609" dur="7.591">report should be released within days</text>
  <text start="192.629" dur="7.571">maybe Friday or Monday that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.2" dur="6.599">probably the time frame so we know the</text>
  <text start="200.2" dur="6.36">deep state whenever news comes out they</text>
  <text start="203.799" dur="5.731">push some type of an event doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="206.56" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s going to happen but they might do</text>
  <text start="209.53" dur="6.12">it so we might be on the lookout for</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="5.58">this Friday or maybe Monday depending on</text>
  <text start="215.65" dur="3.959">when they get word this is coming out</text>
  <text start="217.42" dur="4.98">last time they had an event they were</text>
  <text start="219.609" dur="5.041">completely off and they had the event</text>
  <text start="222.4" dur="4.14">this time they&amp;#39;re going to make sure</text>
  <text start="224.65" dur="5.1">that they have the information to hold</text>
  <text start="226.54" dur="6.33">to have this event to distract from what</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="4.919">is about to happen now the inspector</text>
  <text start="232.87" dur="3.769">general already had the information in</text>
  <text start="234.669" dur="4.77">evidence it&amp;#39;s the manner of</text>
  <text start="236.639" dur="5.77">dissemination and disclosure that is</text>
  <text start="239.439" dur="5.97">being revealed right now and of course</text>
  <text start="242.409" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s going to be on McCabe it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="245.409" dur="4.741">the McCabe report phase one is going to</text>
  <text start="247.989" dur="4.5">be the Clinton email investigation and</text>
  <text start="250.15" dur="4.549">certain election events phase two is</text>
  <text start="252.489" dur="5.161">going to be Carter page FISA application</text>
  <text start="254.699" dur="5.29">includes Stephan helpers actions phase</text>
  <text start="257.65" dur="5.07">three is Russia Trump investigation and</text>
  <text start="259.989" dur="5.161">the Russian narrative segments and</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="3.87">findings will bleed from one face to the</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="2.79">other but this provides a simple</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="3.81">framework of the Inspector General&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="267.94" dur="4.83">approach it&amp;#39;s equally possible that</text>
  <text start="270.4" dur="6.359">phase two and three are blended into one</text>
  <text start="272.77" dur="6.51">final Inspector General&amp;#39;s report we call</text>
  <text start="276.759" dur="4.741">the IG report on Andrew McCabe the</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="3.78">report was very thorough and even</text>
  <text start="281.5" dur="3.539">provided us breadcrumbs regarding</text>
  <text start="283.06" dur="4.38">Loretta Lynch&amp;#39;s interference in the IDI</text>

  <text start="287.44" dur="4.92">into the Weiner laptop Clinton</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="5.37">investigation but the Inspector General</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="4.86">stopped short of covering all of</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="5.069">McCabe&amp;#39;s violations Horowitz McCabe</text>
  <text start="297.22" dur="4.669">reports stated upfront exactly what he</text>
  <text start="299.409" dur="6.63">was addressing so what is he addressing</text>
  <text start="301.889" dur="5.981">well the report addresses the accuracy</text>
  <text start="306.039" dur="4.321">of statements made by then Federal</text>
  <text start="307.87" dur="4.859">Bureau of Investigation deputy director</text>

  <text start="338.74" dur="5.729">violated in disclosing non-public FBI</text>
  <text start="341.319" dur="5.22">information McCabe will likely be</text>
  <text start="344.469" dur="3.811">featured prominently along with Comey in</text>
  <text start="346.539" dur="4.111">the pending inspector general&amp;#39;s report</text>
  <text start="348.28" dur="5.34">and then hope most likely move into</text>
  <text start="350.65" dur="5.85">other phases and again we can expect</text>
  <text start="353.62" dur="5.099">this to be coming out most likely Friday</text>
  <text start="356.5" dur="4.229">or Monday and the Senate Judiciary</text>
  <text start="358.719" dur="5.491">Committee is going to receive this on</text>
  <text start="360.729" dur="5.881">the 5th so again expect something to</text>
  <text start="364.21" dur="4.019">happen doesn&amp;#39;t mean it will but every</text>
  <text start="366.61" dur="3.989">time something like this is released and</text>
  <text start="368.229" dur="5.211">they know it&amp;#39;s coming out they create</text>
  <text start="370.599" dur="6.421">some type of an event so they can have a</text>
  <text start="373.44" dur="7.86">distraction we see George Soros is out</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="8.369">there once again and he is pushing</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="6.22">centralization blending the countries</text>
  <text start="385.389" dur="4.5">together and we talked about this</text>
  <text start="387.52" dur="3.959">yesterday in the report about this is</text>
  <text start="389.889" dur="3.451">what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do and</text>
  <text start="391.479" dur="2.55">remember the deep state they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="393.34" dur="3.539">stopped</text>
  <text start="394.029" dur="4.35">they just didn&amp;#39;t disappear they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="396.879" dur="4.26">here they&amp;#39;re still pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="398.379" dur="7.141">they&amp;#39;re still trying to reach their goal</text>
  <text start="401.139" dur="7.381">and Soros is out there saying that the</text>
  <text start="405.52" dur="5.94">EU should take on debt in order to help</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="5.13">improve economic conditions in Africa as</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="5.4">part of its response to the ongoing</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="4.979">refugee crisis and he was giving a</text>
  <text start="416.86" dur="4.049">speech at the European Council of</text>
  <text start="418.629" dur="5.701">Foreign Relations this is their annual</text>
  <text start="420.909" dur="5.581">meeting and he says that the European</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="5">Union should keep their borders</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="6.419">completely open and let all the refugees</text>
  <text start="429.33" dur="6.28">move wherever they want to go and he</text>
  <text start="432.909" dur="5.43">says the EU should be taking out more</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="6.059">debt to make this possible</text>
  <text start="438.339" dur="4.98">he even pitched the idea of an EU LED</text>
  <text start="441.669" dur="4.881">Marshall Plan for Africa that would</text>
  <text start="443.319" dur="5.611">require at least 30 billion euros</text>
  <text start="446.55" dur="5.47">annually for a number of years to help</text>
  <text start="448.93" dur="4.529">deal with the refugee crisis and of</text>
  <text start="452.02" dur="1.979">course where is all this money going to</text>
  <text start="453.459" dur="3.12">come from</text>
  <text start="453.999" dur="5.25">well they&amp;#39;re gonna have to borrow it</text>
  <text start="456.579" dur="5.04">there&amp;#39;s he says that the EU has a high</text>
  <text start="459.249" dur="5.31">credit rating and it&amp;#39;s borrowing</text>
  <text start="461.619" dur="6.42">capacity is largely unused and he went</text>
  <text start="464.559" dur="4.92">on to say you no one else should we do</text>
  <text start="468.039" dur="3.36">this we should do this now because</text>
  <text start="469.479" dur="6.66">there&amp;#39;s a crisis right in front of us</text>
  <text start="471.399" dur="6.27">and it&amp;#39;s time to do it and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="476.139" dur="4.62">that this is how we&amp;#39;re going to save</text>
  <text start="477.669" dur="5.88">Europe and the European countries are</text>
  <text start="480.759" dur="5.16">saying we don&amp;#39;t want this this is</text>
  <text start="483.549" dur="4.47">something we don&amp;#39;t want this is what the</text>
  <text start="485.919" dur="4.02">deep state the central banks this is</text>
  <text start="488.019" dur="5.01">what they want they want everything</text>
  <text start="489.939" dur="6.06">blend to remember their idea is to have</text>
  <text start="493.029" dur="6.18">every single country on an even playing</text>
  <text start="495.999" dur="6.72">field this way it makes no difference</text>
  <text start="499.209" dur="6.84">where you are this way they can control</text>
  <text start="502.719" dur="4.95">everything all at the same time this is</text>
  <text start="506.049" dur="3.54">their plan from the beginning</text>
  <text start="507.669" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;d be no competition there&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="509.589" dur="5.76">nothing they would just have everyone</text>
  <text start="512.259" dur="7.351">working at a very low wage all enslaved</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="6.42">to them we see that Trump has officially</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="5.07">nominated a new commander for the Afghan</text>
  <text start="521.769" dur="6.031">war and we see that this is a lieutenant</text>
  <text start="524.68" dur="5.389">general Austin Scott Miller and now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="527.8" dur="5.43">taking control of the situation there</text>
  <text start="530.069" dur="6.19">Nicholson General John Nicholson has</text>
  <text start="533.23" dur="6.089">been there since March 2016 and he said</text>
  <text start="536.259" dur="4.95">what is happening in Afghanistan is a</text>
  <text start="539.319" dur="3.96">complete and utter stalemate there&amp;#39;s we</text>
  <text start="541.209" dur="4.32">can&amp;#39;t make any headway and I think this</text>
  <text start="543.279" dur="4.471">is why Trump right now is changing</text>
  <text start="545.529" dur="7.081">things up in Afghanistan because I do</text>
  <text start="547.75" dur="7.91">believe the agenda is to shut everything</text>
  <text start="552.61" dur="6.839">down really go after the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="555.66" dur="6.52">get to the deep state flush them out and</text>
  <text start="559.449" dur="5.88">remove the troops from these areas</text>
  <text start="562.18" dur="4.17">remember what we&amp;#39;re seeing out in the</text>
  <text start="565.329" dur="3.091">Middle East what we&amp;#39;re seeing in</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="4.909">Afghanistan this was all part of the</text>
  <text start="568.42" dur="5.609">deep state plan this was their plan they</text>
  <text start="571.259" dur="5.38">orchestrated it they put everything into</text>
  <text start="574.029" dur="4.711">motion and now it has to be undone and</text>
  <text start="576.639" dur="4.89">this has been going on for years and</text>
  <text start="578.74" dur="6.599">years and years and this is why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="581.529" dur="5.821">taking some time to basically counter</text>
  <text start="585.339" dur="2.351">everything that has been done over the</text>
  <text start="587.35" dur="2.26">many</text>
  <text start="587.69" dur="4.26">years we see that the North Korean</text>
  <text start="589.61" dur="4.26">summit that is proceeding right now and</text>
  <text start="591.95" dur="3.54">we see already the deeps a is putting</text>
  <text start="593.87" dur="5.79">out warning saying that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="595.49" dur="5.46">getting ready to cyberattack so we got</text>
  <text start="599.66" dur="3.54">to make sure that the financial</text>
  <text start="600.95" dur="3.99">institutions are secure because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="603.2" dur="3.75">where they&amp;#39;re going to hit we also have</text>
  <text start="604.94" dur="4.08">this alert from the FBI and the</text>
  <text start="606.95" dur="3.9">Department of Homeland Security saying</text>
  <text start="609.02" dur="4.53">that there is some type of malware</text>
  <text start="610.85" dur="6.6">attack on routers and you need to reboot</text>
  <text start="613.55" dur="6.48">I would say that they&amp;#39;re most likely</text>
  <text start="617.45" dur="4.38">behind this and they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="620.03" dur="4.26">everyone to reboot or they&amp;#39;re cleaning</text>
  <text start="621.83" dur="4.35">up their operation or they&amp;#39;re implanting</text>
  <text start="624.29" dur="4.35">more malware into the router somehow</text>
  <text start="626.18" dur="4.44">some way but for them to come out with a</text>
  <text start="628.64" dur="4.65">message I don&amp;#39;t think it means what</text>
  <text start="630.62" dur="4.14">everyone thinks it means because when</text>
  <text start="633.29" dur="4.47">has the Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="634.76" dur="6.12">and the FBI been on the up-and-up</text>
  <text start="637.76" dur="6.15">they haven&amp;#39;t remember they came out a</text>
  <text start="640.88" dur="5.31">couple days later blaming North Korea</text>
  <text start="643.91" dur="4.32">and Russia and the rest for all these</text>
  <text start="646.19" dur="3.93">different attacks I mean for North Korea</text>
  <text start="648.23" dur="6.03">they blamed them wanna cry in North</text>
  <text start="650.12" dur="7.35">Korea they blamed the Sony hack on North</text>
  <text start="654.26" dur="5.13">Korea and they did this in a matter of</text>
  <text start="657.47" dur="4.26">days they knew exactly who it was and of</text>
  <text start="659.39" dur="4.17">course whenever they do this you know</text>
  <text start="661.73" dur="3.35">it&amp;#39;s a complete and utter setup I mean</text>
  <text start="663.56" dur="4.95">think about it you get spam all the time</text>
  <text start="665.08" dur="5.11">nobody can stop the spam that continues</text>
  <text start="668.51" dur="3.84">they can&amp;#39;t find those people but they</text>
  <text start="670.19" dur="4.62">know exactly who the state actors are I</text>
  <text start="672.35" dur="5.37">mean really think about it it&amp;#39;s mostly</text>
  <text start="674.81" dur="4.53">completely impossible to figure out</text>
  <text start="677.72" dur="3.63">where these attacks are really coming</text>
  <text start="679.34" dur="3.84">from and we know from vault seven and</text>
  <text start="681.35" dur="3.9">everything else that the CIA has the</text>
  <text start="683.18" dur="3.9">ability to replicate all of these</text>
  <text start="685.25" dur="4.83">attacks and of course all they need to</text>
  <text start="687.08" dur="7.05">do is feed us propaganda and who&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="690.08" dur="7.259">to check nobody we see Lebanon right now</text>
  <text start="694.13" dur="6.24">is launching a search for their first</text>
  <text start="697.339" dur="5.641">oil and gas reserves and of course</text>
  <text start="700.37" dur="3.81">Israel is out there threatening Lebanon</text>
  <text start="702.98" dur="3.18">now this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen in</text>
  <text start="704.18" dur="3.57">the Middle East here since all these</text>
  <text start="706.16" dur="3.69">countries are taking back control of</text>
  <text start="707.75" dur="6.69">their countries and now they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="709.85" dur="7.02">ready to basically move forward with</text>
  <text start="714.44" dur="6.6">their economic agendas they&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="721.4" dur="4.35">country other countries are not going to</text>
  <text start="724.19" dur="3.57">like this because that means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="725.75" dur="4.59">losing control and we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="727.76" dur="6.33">disputed areas in Lebanon and Israel out</text>
  <text start="730.34" dur="7.02">in the waterway and Lebanon right now</text>
  <text start="734.09" dur="5.73">has teamed up with France has teamed up</text>
  <text start="737.36" dur="5.04">with Italy and Russia where they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="739.82" dur="4.92">working together looking for all of this</text>
  <text start="742.4" dur="6.8">oil and gas and I believe there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="744.74" dur="7.95">out there and we might see some type of</text>
  <text start="749.2" dur="7.6">crisis in this area we see Iran right</text>
  <text start="752.69" dur="8.19">now is backing European nations for the</text>
  <text start="756.8" dur="7.41">push for a Yemen ceasefire and France</text>
  <text start="760.88" dur="6.72">Germany Britain and other European</text>
  <text start="764.21" dur="5.55">nations are with Iran right now saying</text>
  <text start="767.6" dur="4.68">that we need to have a ceasefire deal in</text>
  <text start="769.76" dur="5.7">Yemen we need to shut this down and we</text>
  <text start="772.28" dur="6.06">need to allow humanitarian aid to flow</text>
  <text start="775.46" dur="5.1">into Yemen and you need to remember the</text>
  <text start="778.34" dur="4.05">deep state they&amp;#39;ve been pushing their</text>
  <text start="780.56" dur="5.55">agenda in all of these countries they</text>
  <text start="782.39" dur="5.52">had a plan and their plan is basically</text>
  <text start="786.11" dur="3.3">out the window right now because</text>
  <text start="787.91" dur="3.48">everything everything that they&amp;#39;ve tried</text>
  <text start="789.41" dur="5.34">to do is now being countered there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="791.39" dur="6.77">pushback just like with North Korea we</text>
  <text start="794.75" dur="7.11">see Iran as ausco also asking OPEC for</text>
  <text start="798.16" dur="6.87">some help and they&amp;#39;re citing article 2</text>
  <text start="801.86" dur="5.1">of the OPEC statute which emphasizes</text>
  <text start="805.03" dur="3.46">safeguarding the interest of member</text>
  <text start="806.96" dur="4.86">countries individually and collectively</text>
  <text start="808.49" dur="5.91">and why are they doing this because of</text>
  <text start="811.82" dur="5.79">all the sanctions that the US Treasury</text>
  <text start="814.4" dur="5.01">is putting on Iran because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="817.61" dur="5.1">pressure on Iran right now because the</text>
  <text start="819.41" dur="7.2">deep state is in there and right now we</text>
  <text start="822.71" dur="6.45">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of slush money moving</text>
  <text start="826.61" dur="4.41">through Iran keeping this deal</text>
  <text start="829.16" dur="4.95">operational this is why we had these</text>
  <text start="831.02" dur="5.34">pallets of cash going over to Iran and</text>
  <text start="834.11" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s a lot more cash that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="836.36" dur="5.9">even know about which is feeding the</text>
  <text start="839.03" dur="7.56">munster the enemy the deep state and</text>
  <text start="842.26" dur="7.21">right now Iran is looking to figure out</text>
  <text start="846.59" dur="4.86">a way where they can get these funds</text>
  <text start="849.47" dur="3.51">continually flowing into their country</text>
  <text start="851.45" dur="3.39">and I don&amp;#39;t believe at this point in</text>
  <text start="852.98" dur="4.17">time that the</text>
  <text start="854.84" dur="4.53">European countries have come to an</text>
  <text start="857.15" dur="6.42">understanding on what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="859.37" dur="6.35">do for Iran monetarily and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="863.57" dur="5.49">wait to see how that turns out</text>
  <text start="865.72" dur="5.71">we see right now that there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="869.06" dur="4.74">in Gaza like there has always been and</text>
  <text start="871.43" dur="4.58">it looks like there was an agreement</text>
  <text start="873.8" dur="5.01">that was ironed out because a number of</text>
  <text start="876.01" dur="4.39">mediators intervene in the past hours</text>
  <text start="878.81" dur="4.08">and there was an agreement that was</text>
  <text start="880.4" dur="5.97">reached to return to a ceasefire in Gaza</text>
  <text start="882.89" dur="6.06">but Israel is not really abiding by this</text>
  <text start="886.37" dur="6.24">and they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="888.95" dur="6.69">be attacking if Hamas continually fires</text>
  <text start="892.61" dur="6.12">at Israel now a lot of times these are</text>
  <text start="895.64" dur="6.21">false flags a lot of times this is all</text>
  <text start="898.73" dur="4.47">set up so Israel can go in and move into</text>
  <text start="901.85" dur="3.75">these areas because what we see</text>
  <text start="903.2" dur="5.97">happening right now is that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="905.6" dur="7.26">army is mounting a major offensive in</text>
  <text start="909.17" dur="5.7">the southern area all along this area</text>
  <text start="912.86" dur="4.47">and it looks like Israel&amp;#39;s also ramping</text>
  <text start="914.87" dur="4.14">up and there&amp;#39;s going to be a huge amount</text>
  <text start="917.33" dur="3.3">of conflict in this area and we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="919.01" dur="3.75">about that in just a minute but before</text>
  <text start="920.63" dur="5.04">that the Syrian army they have</text>
  <text start="922.76" dur="5.97">discovered tunnels armories explosives</text>
  <text start="925.67" dur="6.09">in a former rebel Bastion in South</text>
  <text start="928.73" dur="4.86">Damascus and this is how the rebels and</text>
  <text start="931.76" dur="3.99">the terrorists got back and forth and</text>
  <text start="933.59" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s tunnels running all underground</text>
  <text start="935.75" dur="4.32">in this entire area under Damascus</text>
  <text start="938.45" dur="3.36">throughout the country and this is how</text>
  <text start="940.07" dur="3.57">they move weapons back and forth and</text>
  <text start="941.81" dur="4.59">individuals back and forth to different</text>
  <text start="943.64" dur="6.36">areas now we see that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="946.4" dur="5.97">protesting Syria in regards to the</text>
  <text start="950" dur="5.91">international disarmament conference now</text>
  <text start="952.37" dur="5.76">this was formed in 1979 this is the</text>
  <text start="955.91" dur="5.64">conference on Disarmament it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="958.13" dur="6.66">multilateral disarmament forum and if it</text>
  <text start="961.55" dur="5.31">establishes the international community</text>
  <text start="964.79" dur="6.6">which rotates its presidency</text>
  <text start="966.86" dur="8.85">according to alphabetical order so right</text>
  <text start="971.39" dur="7.14">now we&amp;#39;re up to Syria and this is why</text>
  <text start="975.71" dur="6.33">the deep state doesn&amp;#39;t want this this is</text>
  <text start="978.53" dur="7.5">why they&amp;#39;re saying that Syria should not</text>
  <text start="982.04" dur="6.83">have a turn in running this now of</text>
  <text start="986.03" dur="7.17">course Syria is a sovereign country</text>
  <text start="988.87" dur="8.53">Assad is an elected leader and right now</text>
  <text start="993.2" dur="8.52">there is no reason why Syria shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="997.4" dur="6.78">head this up I mean the deep state</text>
  <text start="1001.72" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re still sticking to the chemical</text>
  <text start="1004.18" dur="5.55">weapons attack in Duma they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1007.6" dur="5.1">still sticking to Assad</text>
  <text start="1009.73" dur="6.24">you know carries out torture on his own</text>
  <text start="1012.7" dur="5.88">people and they&amp;#39;re continually still</text>
  <text start="1015.97" dur="5.16">pushing this agenda but you have to</text>
  <text start="1018.58" dur="4.62">remember the u.s. is widely known to</text>
  <text start="1021.13" dur="6.209">have employed depleted uranium munitions</text>
  <text start="1023.2" dur="8.07">in Iraq during the Iraqi war which led</text>
  <text start="1027.339" dur="5.911">to deaths of over 1 million Iraqis and I</text>
  <text start="1031.27" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t think the US right now it has a</text>
  <text start="1033.25" dur="6.26">leg to stand on and they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="1036.67" dur="6.09">their agenda just like they always do</text>
  <text start="1039.51" dur="5.17">because their agenda is to remove Assad</text>
  <text start="1042.76" dur="4.5">I mean that&amp;#39;s they haven&amp;#39;t given up on</text>
  <text start="1044.68" dur="4.11">this the deep state even though it that</text>
  <text start="1047.26" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re being pushed out of the</text>
  <text start="1048.79" dur="6">situation their plan still is to remove</text>
  <text start="1052.24" dur="4.74">Assad and then have regime change in</text>
  <text start="1054.79" dur="5.25">Iran that&amp;#39;s where they want to go with</text>
  <text start="1056.98" dur="8.94">all this and right now it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1060.04" dur="8.55">tough now Washington is warning and this</text>
  <text start="1065.92" dur="6.47">is the deep state warning the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1068.59" dur="8.16">government from mounting this offensive</text>
  <text start="1072.39" dur="10.36">now remember this is Syria this is their</text>
  <text start="1076.75" dur="7.92">land the deep state invaded Syria along</text>
  <text start="1082.75" dur="4.26">with the coalition forces they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1084.67" dur="6.75">invited into the country and the deep</text>
  <text start="1087.01" dur="7.2">state is warning Syria not to take back</text>
  <text start="1091.42" dur="3.33">their land which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1094.21" dur="3.96">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1094.75" dur="8.94">Lavrov right now he is out there saying</text>
  <text start="1098.17" dur="7.68">listen all foreign troops all non Syrian</text>
  <text start="1103.69" dur="5.04">forces must withdraw from the</text>
  <text start="1105.85" dur="6.15">de-escalation zone in southern Syria</text>
  <text start="1108.73" dur="9.09">which was established by the US Russia</text>
  <text start="1112" dur="8.7">and Jordan in July of 2017 and he went</text>
  <text start="1117.82" dur="3.81">on to say as regards the confrontation</text>
  <text start="1120.7" dur="3.38">between Israel</text>
  <text start="1121.63" dur="5.34">ran in Syria we have agreements on the</text>
  <text start="1124.08" dur="4.3">south-western de-escalation zone these</text>
  <text start="1126.97" dur="3.05">agreements have been reached between</text>
  <text start="1128.38" dur="5.07">Russia the United States and Jordan</text>
  <text start="1130.02" dur="6.82">Israel was informed about them as we</text>
  <text start="1133.45" dur="6.03">were working on them they agreements</text>
  <text start="1136.84" dur="5.79">stipulate that this the escalation zone</text>
  <text start="1139.48" dur="5.88">should consolidate stability while all</text>
  <text start="1142.63" dur="5.67">non Syrian forces must be withdrawn from</text>
  <text start="1145.36" dur="5.1">this area and I think that this should</text>
  <text start="1148.3" dur="5.22">happen as soon as possible</text>
  <text start="1150.46" dur="5.19">Lavrov and this new agreement will allow</text>
  <text start="1153.52" dur="5.31">the Syrian army to launch a large-scale</text>
  <text start="1155.65" dur="6.72">military operation to recapture areas</text>
  <text start="1158.83" dur="6.54">along the border with Jordan and the</text>
  <text start="1162.37" dur="5.79">contact line with Israel and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1165.37" dur="5.7">think Israel wants to go along with this</text>
  <text start="1168.16" dur="7.2">and what this means is that all foreign</text>
  <text start="1171.07" dur="7.83">forces will have to leave and no it just</text>
  <text start="1175.36" dur="7.05">doesn&amp;#39;t mean Iran it means all foreign</text>
  <text start="1178.9" dur="6.42">forces and this I think is the problem</text>
  <text start="1182.41" dur="6.75">for Israel and I think the agreement was</text>
  <text start="1185.32" dur="6.42">made so all foreign forces can leave the</text>
  <text start="1189.16" dur="5.43">area where the troops from the US can</text>
  <text start="1191.74" dur="5.61">leave the area which means the troops</text>
  <text start="1194.59" dur="6.99">would be withdrawn this was done on</text>
  <text start="1197.35" dur="6.48">purpose which means that Syria is taking</text>
  <text start="1201.58" dur="5.01">back part of their country they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1203.83" dur="3.96">to control the borders this has been the</text>
  <text start="1206.59" dur="4.26">plan all along</text>
  <text start="1207.79" dur="5.79">remember plans do change the deep state</text>
  <text start="1210.85" dur="4.68">plan changes the Patriots plan changes</text>
  <text start="1213.58" dur="5.04">it depends what obstacles there are</text>
  <text start="1215.53" dur="5.73">right now this was the plan and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1218.62" dur="6.09">continuing on with this plan to remove</text>
  <text start="1221.26" dur="9.42">the forces from Syria and if you notice</text>
  <text start="1224.71" dur="7.98">the call from Russia from Syria to have</text>
  <text start="1230.68" dur="4.56">all foreign troops remove themselves</text>
  <text start="1232.69" dur="4.89">from Syria it&amp;#39;s getting louder and</text>
  <text start="1235.24" dur="4.29">louder and they&amp;#39;re mentioning it more</text>
  <text start="1237.58" dur="4.71">often and the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1239.53" dur="6.03">this it is because they&amp;#39;re leading up to</text>
  <text start="1242.29" dur="5.85">a point where eventually Syria will take</text>
  <text start="1245.56" dur="4.29">control of the entire country and all</text>
  <text start="1248.14" dur="5.01">troops must leave and I believe this is</text>
  <text start="1249.85" dur="5.059">why Putin mentioned that all troops and</text>
  <text start="1253.15" dur="4.79">included Iran</text>
  <text start="1254.909" dur="6.781">Russia would stay and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1257.94" dur="6.059">going to happen is Syria will say Iran</text>
  <text start="1261.69" dur="4.709">you must leave and all foreign troops</text>
  <text start="1263.999" dur="4.89">must leave and at this point the</text>
  <text start="1266.399" dur="4.08">coalition forces they&amp;#39;re really gonna</text>
  <text start="1268.889" dur="3.09">have to come up with some other type of</text>
  <text start="1270.479" dur="3.15">scenario of why they need to stay</text>
  <text start="1271.979" dur="2.55">otherwise they&amp;#39;re gonna have to leave</text>
  <text start="1273.629" dur="2.52">and that&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult</text>
  <text start="1274.529" dur="3.03">well they try to come up with something</text>
  <text start="1276.149" dur="5.28">well they try to create an event well</text>
  <text start="1277.559" dur="6">they try maybe but the point is is at</text>
  <text start="1281.429" dur="4.95">this point the warnings have been out</text>
  <text start="1283.559" dur="5.58">there Syria and Russia have been asking</text>
  <text start="1286.379" dur="4.98">soon it&amp;#39;s going to go to the UN and you</text>
  <text start="1289.139" dur="4.681">know that Russia and China they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1291.359" dur="4.38">to back this up yes the US might veto it</text>
  <text start="1293.82" dur="3.689">nikki Haley might come out and say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1295.739" dur="4.68">gonna veto this maybe she&amp;#39;ll be removed</text>
  <text start="1297.509" dur="6.72">by that time but they&amp;#39;re gonna have the</text>
  <text start="1300.419" dur="6.031">vote they&amp;#39;re gonna have the power and I</text>
  <text start="1304.229" dur="3.69">think what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the</text>
  <text start="1306.45" dur="2.729">coalition forces are going to be if</text>
  <text start="1307.919" dur="3.781">they&amp;#39;re not going to leave on their own</text>
  <text start="1309.179" dur="4.141">they will be forced to leave now again</text>
  <text start="1311.7" dur="4.609">anything could happen</text>
  <text start="1313.32" dur="4.859">but right now this is the plan</text>
