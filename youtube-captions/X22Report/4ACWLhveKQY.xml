  <text start="204.39" dur="6.45">can see what you&amp;#39;re buying where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="5.67">travelling and if the percentage of what</text>

  <text start="213.51" dur="4.71">that you&amp;#39;re bringing in they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="5.1">flag it now to me this is how there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="4.44">lot of privacy issues first of all where</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="4.079">are they getting this information how</text>
  <text start="222.66" dur="5.85">are they allowed to get this information</text>
  <text start="224.549" dur="9.211">and these are an infringement on our</text>
  <text start="228.51" dur="8.22">rights and this is their they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="5.43">entering into a territory where the IRS</text>
  <text start="236.73" dur="5.46">is going to have lawsuits coming out of</text>
  <text start="239.19" dur="6.21">the ears because the Constitution the</text>
  <text start="242.19" dur="6.479">Bill of Rights allows us to have private</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="5.22">they can&amp;#39;t search they can&amp;#39;t wiretap and</text>
  <text start="248.669" dur="4.41">I know there&amp;#39;s laws out there and</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="4.199">they&amp;#39;re doing it anyhow but this is</text>
  <text start="253.079" dur="3.331">going too far and you know why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.819" dur="4.441">doing this is because there are tax</text>
  <text start="256.41" dur="5.639">revenues right now can&amp;#39;t even pay the</text>
  <text start="259.26" dur="5.82">interest on the debt so they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="8.041">to find money anyway they possibly can</text>
  <text start="265.08" dur="8.04">and this is not going to turn out well</text>
  <text start="270.09" dur="5.46">and you can tell the endgame is here</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="8.299">because they&amp;#39;re grabbing at anything</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="9.179">they possibly can to get money now</text>
  <text start="281.419" dur="6.83">draghi comes out and says you know that</text>
  <text start="284.729" dur="5.5">he might be slashing rates and</text>
  <text start="288.249" dur="4.65">there might be a negative deposit rate</text>
  <text start="290.229" dur="8.58">now why would you put your money in the</text>
  <text start="292.899" dur="10.05">bank to get negative rates and it makes</text>
  <text start="298.809" dur="7.91">no sense whatsoever we know that other</text>
  <text start="302.949" dur="6.72">countries have already created a similar</text>
  <text start="306.719" dur="6.12">FDIC Bank of England document which</text>
  <text start="309.669" dur="5.07">allows them to Cyprus your account</text>
  <text start="312.839" dur="4.81">Switzerland&amp;#39;s doing it Australia is</text>
  <text start="314.739" dur="5.22">doing at Canada&amp;#39;s doing it European</text>
  <text start="317.649" dur="8.36">nation well pretty much already is</text>
  <text start="319.959" dur="12.06">already doing it and we are going to see</text>
  <text start="326.009" dur="7.87">money frozen and taken out of the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.019" dur="3.12">now if you&amp;#39;re getting a negative return</text>
  <text start="333.879" dur="4.05">right now you&amp;#39;re getting a zero percent</text>
  <text start="335.139" dur="3.9">return or less than one percent why</text>
  <text start="337.929" dur="3.12">would you keep your money in the bank</text>
  <text start="339.039" dur="4.8">anyhow what what are you getting out of</text>
  <text start="341.049" dur="4.2">it and if you do keep it in there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.839" dur="2.58">going to be frozen and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="345.249" dur="4.46">stuck there and then they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="346.419" dur="7.83">take it and give you you know stocks</text>
  <text start="349.709" dur="7.21">from the bank that&amp;#39;s underwater and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.249" dur="6.69">another piece of worthless paper it</text>
  <text start="356.919" dur="5.61">makes no sense and just playing on this</text>
  <text start="360.939" dur="4.71">there was an interesting article in them</text>
  <text start="362.529" dur="5.581">it was a market watch where it says you</text>
  <text start="365.649" dur="3.961">have too many bank accounts fewer</text>
  <text start="368.11" dur="4.709">accounts lead to better household</text>
  <text start="369.61" dur="6.329">budgeting study finds now when I read</text>
  <text start="372.819" dur="7.77">this they&amp;#39;re telling you to combine your</text>
  <text start="375.939" dur="6.54">accounts into one to me i&amp;#39;m reading this</text>
  <text start="380.589" dur="5.76">completely differently than what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="382.479" dur="5.881">saying here they want people especially</text>
  <text start="386.349" dur="3.96">the older people who you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.36" dur="4.229">insured up to a certain amount in the</text>
  <text start="390.309" dur="4.17">bank so they split their money up into</text>
  <text start="392.589" dur="5.1">many different accounts this is how i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="394.479" dur="5.19">reading it so if i have a hundred</text>
  <text start="397.689" dur="4.62">thousand dollars in three four five</text>
  <text start="399.669" dur="5.4">different accounts they want you to take</text>
  <text start="402.309" dur="5.7">that and put it into one account i&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="405.069" dur="6.72">make it a lot easier but to me when out</text>
  <text start="408.009" dur="6.601">what i&amp;#39;m seeing is put it into one</text>
  <text start="411.789" dur="6.9">account so this way we have unsecured</text>
  <text start="414.61" dur="7.44">funds that we can access when we cyprus</text>
  <text start="418.689" dur="5.251">you and when I say Cyprus you I mean the</text>
  <text start="422.05" dur="4.47">that they&amp;#39;ll freeze that amount of money</text>
  <text start="423.94" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;ll give you the stock they&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="426.52" dur="5.04">your money and basically you just lost</text>
  <text start="428.71" dur="4.109">it that&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;m reading this I mean it</text>
  <text start="431.56" dur="3.18">is the most ridiculous thing I&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="432.819" dur="4.291">heard of that if you have too many</text>
  <text start="434.74" dur="4.29">counts you can&amp;#39;t save money because you</text>
  <text start="437.11" dur="4.589">know you know if I have a thousand</text>
  <text start="439.03" dur="4.56">dollars or 5,000 or 10,000 you know and</text>
  <text start="441.699" dur="4.381">I have to divide between three accounts</text>
  <text start="443.59" dur="4.919">I just can&amp;#39;t figure that out so</text>
  <text start="446.08" dur="6.059">basically what they&amp;#39;re telling you and I</text>
  <text start="448.509" dur="8.931">noticed that all these news magazines</text>
  <text start="452.139" dur="8.191">and articles always give you</text>
  <text start="457.44" dur="5.11">stories you know even like weight loss</text>
  <text start="460.33" dur="6.42">you know oh if you eat too much of that</text>
  <text start="462.55" dur="6.63">or this many calories or this type of</text>
  <text start="466.75" dur="6.09">stuff you know you doing too many</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="7.53">sit-ups might hurt you doing too many</text>
  <text start="472.84" dur="6.27">arm curls might hurt your muscle I mean</text>
  <text start="476.71" dur="4.199">it just it&amp;#39;s ridiculous what they put</text>
  <text start="479.11" dur="5.64">out there and this just feels like one</text>
  <text start="480.909" dur="6.75">of those articles that just is a bunch</text>
  <text start="484.75" dur="8.159">of and basically all they want</text>
  <text start="487.659" dur="6.721">to do is I have an easier way of taking</text>
  <text start="492.909" dur="3.75">your money so basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.38" dur="4.62">saying is hey can you make it a lot</text>
  <text start="496.659" dur="5.281">easier for us because we want to take</text>
  <text start="499" dur="6.63">your money but we don&amp;#39;t we want to make</text>
  <text start="501.94" dur="6.779">sure that we can get all the unsecured</text>
  <text start="505.63" dur="4.56">uninsured funds and for us to do this</text>
  <text start="508.719" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;re going to need you to combine your</text>
  <text start="510.19" dur="5.58">accounts that&amp;#39;s basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.169" dur="7.381">doing that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re saying ok</text>
  <text start="515.77" dur="5.49">let&amp;#39;s move on here in California the</text>
  <text start="519.55" dur="5.01">governor signs a gun calm state</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="6.36">confiscation bill and this is completely</text>
  <text start="524.56" dur="4.5">null and void and according to the</text>
  <text start="527.62" dur="5.969">Second Amendment and according to</text>
  <text start="529.06" dur="6.33">Marbury vs. Madison and in that case the</text>
  <text start="533.589" dur="3.961">Supreme Court case ruling it says the</text>
  <text start="535.39" dur="4.67">law repugnant to the Constitution is</text>
  <text start="537.55" dur="4.95">void and the word repugnant means</text>
  <text start="540.06" dur="5.29">incompatible inconsistent so</text>
  <text start="542.5" dur="6">inconsistent to the Constitution Second</text>
  <text start="545.35" dur="6.39">Amendment says the people have the right</text>
  <text start="548.5" dur="5.76">to bear arms and it should not shall not</text>
  <text start="551.74" dur="4.08">be infringed upon so basically this law</text>
  <text start="554.26" dur="5.4">that they came out with</text>
  <text start="555.82" dur="7.08">is completely null and void and this</text>
  <text start="559.66" dur="6.3">looks like it&amp;#39;s going to be a template</text>
  <text start="562.9" dur="5.4">just like New York for those states that</text>
  <text start="565.96" dur="5.31">are already on the edge of collapse that</text>
  <text start="568.3" dur="4.59">have huge populations where they need to</text>
  <text start="571.27" dur="5.52">get the guns away from the people and</text>
  <text start="572.89" dur="7.11">they&amp;#39;re going to use this to do it</text>
  <text start="576.79" dur="5.37">basically what it is you know it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="580" dur="3.6">same story they need to get the guns</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="3.39">they need to do what they need to do</text>
  <text start="583.6" dur="3.9">because they know the collapse is</text>
  <text start="585.55" dur="6.15">comming they know what is ahead of them</text>
  <text start="587.5" dur="6.96">and it&amp;#39;s they need to do this now on the</text>
  <text start="591.7" dur="4.77">opposite end a Texas town passes</text>
  <text start="594.46" dur="6.15">resolution encouraging gun ownership by</text>

  <text start="646.03" dur="7.23">ironical government DHS or anything else</text>
  <text start="649.9" dur="6.23">that is why our founding fathers put</text>
  <text start="653.26" dur="5.93">that in there it&amp;#39;s a simple one sentence</text>
  <text start="656.13" dur="5.5">that tells us that we have this right</text>
  <text start="659.19" dur="5.71">you can&amp;#39;t really mess it up except for</text>

  <text start="668.98" dur="3.9">need these weapons all the time no you</text>
  <text start="671.47" dur="5.31">know we take it out to the range we</text>
  <text start="672.88" dur="6.18">practice but when we do need it they are</text>
  <text start="676.78" dur="4.92">there just like our other prepping</text>
  <text start="679.06" dur="9.6">things we have water when we need it it</text>

  <text start="688.66" dur="2.31">with the founding</text>
  <text start="689.44" dur="3.54">fathers they&amp;#39;re the ones who created</text>

  <text start="1455.149" dur="6.931">just look back here so back in quarter</text>
  <text start="1458.539" dur="6.301">one of 2012 they said the market is</text>
  <text start="1462.08" dur="6.419">going to be 14 753 so I think they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1464.84" dur="5.839">little off here in in their predictions</text>
  <text start="1468.499" dur="5.13">but they got it to where they wanted it</text>
  <text start="1470.679" dur="6.61">so the quarter one quarter to quarter</text>
  <text start="1473.629" dur="7.081">three quarter for of 2012 were I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="1477.289" dur="8.76">at quarter three of 2012 2012 we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="1480.71" dur="8.399">14 997 almost hitting 15,000 then Q</text>
  <text start="1486.049" dur="3.361">quarter for of 2012 they said it went</text>
  <text start="1489.109" dur="4.981">down</text>
  <text start="1489.41" dur="7.71">212 105 so if we look at this I would</text>
  <text start="1494.09" dur="8.28">say where their prediction is a little</text>
  <text start="1497.12" dur="9.66">off but we&amp;#39;re at quarter third quarter 3</text>
  <text start="1502.37" dur="6.69">2012 at 14 997 so I said let me see how</text>
  <text start="1506.78" dur="5.46">this corresponds going back to two</text>
  <text start="1509.06" dur="9.35">thousand eight and I went back to two</text>
  <text start="1512.24" dur="14.57">thousand eight and when we had the the</text>
  <text start="1518.41" dur="11.56">collapse in 2009 the the the market fell</text>
  <text start="1526.81" dur="8.38">their prediction was two thousand nine</text>
  <text start="1529.97" dur="11.33">eight 1134 the Dow Jones but the market</text>
  <text start="1535.19" dur="13.04">at that time actually fell to six 6547</text>
  <text start="1541.3" dur="14.38">so here in 2013 they are predicting on</text>
  <text start="1548.23" dur="12.79">quarter for of 2013 for the stock market</text>
  <text start="1555.68" dur="8.37">to come down to 7221 now again I think</text>
  <text start="1561.02" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re there a little bit behind in what</text>
  <text start="1564.05" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re doing because right now we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1565.61" dur="7.35">quarter one quarter to in 2013 and they</text>
  <text start="1570.74" dur="5.52">predicted 9,000 but we&amp;#39;re just hitting</text>
  <text start="1572.96" dur="9.84">the 14 997 so it looks like we&amp;#39;re two</text>
  <text start="1576.26" dur="15.33">quarters behind so we&amp;#39;re looking at a</text>
  <text start="1582.8" dur="10.41">drop probably early summer yeah around</text>
  <text start="1591.59" dur="5.49">early summer to come down to nine</text>
  <text start="1593.21" dur="6.96">thousand or so because that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1597.08" dur="5.99">they&amp;#39;re predicting here and then come</text>
  <text start="1600.17" dur="7.71">the end of the year we&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="1603.07" dur="8.11">start dropping off now I mean this</text>
  <text start="1607.88" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;ve come very close to all the dips</text>
  <text start="1611.18" dur="6.78">and the highs and we&amp;#39;re just a little</text>
  <text start="1614.24" dur="7.44">bit off right now but they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="1617.96" dur="5.13">this to come down to 7221 which is</text>
  <text start="1621.68" dur="4.35">pretty much half</text>
  <text start="1623.09" dur="6.99">what the stock market is right now but</text>
  <text start="1626.03" dur="6.57">if we factor in everything else I think</text>
  <text start="1630.08" dur="5.49">there I think it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot</text>
  <text start="1632.6" dur="5.01">worse than what they&amp;#39;re saying I mean</text>
  <text start="1635.57" dur="8.43">they&amp;#39;re looking let&amp;#39;s just go let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1637.61" dur="10.53">do this at they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="1644" dur="11.22">unemployment at the fourth quarter of</text>
  <text start="1648.14" dur="10.44">2013 at almost twelve percent and we</text>
  <text start="1655.22" dur="6.6">have to remember what else is going on</text>
  <text start="1658.58" dur="5.52">here yes this is their scenario but we</text>
  <text start="1661.82" dur="4.53">have things and this this report is</text>
  <text start="1664.1" dur="5.4">given let me give let me bring it up</text>
  <text start="1666.35" dur="7.8">this is the dodd-frank act stress test</text>
  <text start="1669.5" dur="7.2">for March 2013 that&amp;#39;s what this is but</text>
  <text start="1674.15" dur="4.71">the thing is you know this is what</text>
  <text start="1676.7" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re presenting to the government but</text>
  <text start="1678.86" dur="4.68">we have to factor in what else is going</text>
  <text start="1680.72" dur="5.67">on around in the world and if you notice</text>
  <text start="1683.54" dur="7.2">the last drop that they predicted was</text>
  <text start="1686.39" dur="9.75">supposed to be at 8113 in 2009 but it</text>
  <text start="1690.74" dur="6.78">would was really 6547 but back then we</text>
  <text start="1696.14" dur="5.84">didn&amp;#39;t have unemployment the way it is</text>
