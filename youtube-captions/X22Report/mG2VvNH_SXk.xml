  <text start="219.09" dur="3.57">as he possibly can and we know this is</text>
  <text start="220.62" dur="4.44">not for the people it&amp;#39;s kept in secret</text>
  <text start="222.66" dur="5.76">it is for the corporation&amp;#39;s the bankers</text>
  <text start="225.06" dur="7.41">and we see there&amp;#39;s 12 nations they</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="6.719">failed to reach a deal on the TPP even</text>
  <text start="232.47" dur="7.41">in Hawaii they said yeah you know</text>
  <text start="235.139" dur="7.531">something this TPP it is not for us so</text>
  <text start="239.88" dur="5.939">what are we seeing here they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="242.67" dur="5.219">very difficult time pushing this TPP</text>
  <text start="245.819" dur="3.441">people are looking into it even though</text>
  <text start="247.889" dur="4.261">they&amp;#39;re keeping it a secret other</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="4.449">countries people are looking into it</text>
  <text start="252.15" dur="5.28">saying yeah this does not work out for</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="6.631">us and the corporate powers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="257.43" dur="5.85">care how they get this passed they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="5.73">care because they know it is just for</text>
  <text start="263.28" dur="4.74">them they know it will benefit them they</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t care about the people they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="4.619">care about the government&amp;#39;s they only</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="4.32">care about their own agenda right now</text>
  <text start="272.639" dur="5.701">and again I&amp;#39;ve said this many times</text>
  <text start="274.62" dur="6.69">central bankers corporate powers no</text>
  <text start="278.34" dur="6.36">allegiance to a country or people it is</text>
  <text start="281.31" dur="6.03">to themselves that is it we see Congress</text>
  <text start="284.7" dur="5.339">did something very interesting they took</text>
  <text start="287.34" dur="5.46">about 15 minutes and they passed a new</text>
  <text start="290.039" dur="6.211">bill that allows the Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="292.8" dur="5.63">to revoke Americans passports with no</text>
  <text start="296.25" dur="6.12">due process</text>
  <text start="298.43" dur="6.79">they did this on Tuesday and we really</text>
  <text start="302.37" dur="5.13">didn&amp;#39;t hear much about this and the US</text>
  <text start="305.22" dur="5.61">House of Representative passed via voice</text>
  <text start="307.5" dur="7.68">vote the foreign terrorist organization</text>
  <text start="310.83" dur="8.01">passport revocation act of 2015 its</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="7.8">intent to authorize the revocation of</text>
  <text start="318.84" dur="6.3">denial of passports and passport cards</text>
  <text start="322.98" dur="5.25">to individuals affiliated with foreign</text>
  <text start="325.14" dur="4.83">terrorist organizations and for other</text>
  <text start="328.23" dur="3.33">purposes and of course those other</text>
  <text start="329.97" dur="3.63">purposes they don&amp;#39;t tell you what they</text>
  <text start="331.56" dur="5.58">are the Secretary of State may refuse to</text>
  <text start="333.6" dur="6.39">issue a passport or reviews or revoke a</text>
  <text start="337.14" dur="5.28">previously issued one to any individual</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="5.58">whom the Secretary has determined has</text>
  <text start="342.42" dur="8.13">aided assisted abetted or otherwise</text>
  <text start="345.57" dur="7.28">helped in organization the Secretary has</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="5.85">designated as a foreign terrorist</text>
  <text start="352.85" dur="7.35">organization so all the Secretary has to</text>
  <text start="356.4" dur="6.06">do is say yes you are part of this or</text>
  <text start="360.2" dur="3.22">we&amp;#39;re doing this for other reasons so</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="3.24">they really don&amp;#39;t have to have any</text>
  <text start="363.42" dur="4.46">reasons there&amp;#39;s no due process basically</text>
  <text start="365.7" dur="8.28">it&amp;#39;s a violation of all of your rights</text>
  <text start="367.88" dur="9.16">HR 237 which is the FTO and this will</text>
  <text start="373.98" dur="5.84">allow the Secretary of State with</text>
  <text start="377.04" dur="4.95">unchecked authority to prohibit</text>
  <text start="379.82" dur="3.97">individuals from traveling</text>
  <text start="381.99" dur="6.3">internationally this is really what it</text>
  <text start="383.79" dur="6.93">means so what are we seeing here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.29" dur="7.56">going to stop people from leaving the</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="6.57">country and if they decide they could</text>
  <text start="395.85" dur="3.75">say you&amp;#39;re part of a terrorist</text>
  <text start="397.29" dur="4.77">organization it&amp;#39;s that easy without any</text>
  <text start="399.6" dur="4.8">proof or evidence and if you notice this</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="5.25">is continually happening more and more</text>
  <text start="404.4" dur="5.25">where they&amp;#39;re pushing these new laws</text>
  <text start="407.31" dur="5.42">where they don&amp;#39;t have to have proof of</text>
  <text start="409.65" dur="5.49">anything and this is not a democracy</text>
  <text start="412.73" dur="5.05">it&amp;#39;s a violation of your rights and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="415.14" dur="6.3">really turning out to be basically a</text>
  <text start="417.78" dur="6.36">dictatorship whatever they say goes out</text>
  <text start="421.44" dur="6.36">in Kiev we understand the court has</text>
  <text start="424.14" dur="6.39">ruled that the self rule for Dom bass is</text>
  <text start="427.8" dur="4.169">constitutional and poroshenko right now</text>
  <text start="430.53" dur="3.599">is</text>
  <text start="431.969" dur="4.35">still saying that they&amp;#39;re still going to</text>
  <text start="434.129" dur="6.72">be no special status granted to these</text>
  <text start="436.319" dur="7.08">areas and right now the government&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="440.849" dur="5.37">Lugansk and Donetsk they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="443.399" dur="6.15">this doesn&amp;#39;t live up to the Mint&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="446.219" dur="5.82">agreement because what we&amp;#39;re seeing here</text>
  <text start="449.549" dur="4.77">is that the president under this new law</text>
  <text start="452.039" dur="7.35">that he&amp;#39;s the amendments that he created</text>
  <text start="454.319" dur="8.52">he can suspend these self government</text>
  <text start="459.389" dur="5.221">bodies whenever he wants so really is</text>
  <text start="462.839" dur="5.07">this really self governance if he has</text>
  <text start="464.61" dur="6.029">the control to do this no it is not now</text>
  <text start="467.909" dur="5.73">out in Ukraine&amp;#39;s rib-knit region which</text>
  <text start="470.639" dur="4.68">is the west portion of Ukraine they are</text>
  <text start="473.639" dur="3.36">on the brink of war with the government</text>
  <text start="475.319" dur="3.99">in Kiev local authorities there are</text>
  <text start="476.999" dur="4.32">tired of the gut the current</text>
  <text start="479.309" dur="4.17">government&amp;#39;s criminal policy they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.319" dur="3.48">saying this corruption and basically</text>
  <text start="483.479" dur="2.64">what they&amp;#39;re saying is they&amp;#39;re sick and</text>
  <text start="484.799" dur="3">tired of this puppet government that the</text>
  <text start="486.119" dur="4.35">United States have put into Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="487.799" dur="4.53">this is on the west portion of Ukraine</text>
  <text start="490.469" dur="4.61">this is not even in the southeastern</text>
  <text start="492.329" dur="5.69">area so we can see many of the people in</text>
  <text start="495.079" dur="5.44">Ukraine are getting sick and tired of</text>
  <text start="498.019" dur="5.341">what is going on there and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="500.519" dur="6.3">seeing this in Yemen Libya Lebanon Iraq</text>
  <text start="503.36" dur="5.739">and all the people are doing the same</text>
  <text start="506.819" dur="3.93">because eventually what happens is the</text>
  <text start="509.099" dur="3.451">people getting sick and tired of this</text>
  <text start="510.749" dur="3.9">puppet government which was not elected</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="3.959">by the people which was installed in</text>
  <text start="514.649" dur="4.651">their government and basically the</text>
  <text start="516.509" dur="6.9">government&amp;#39;s destroy each one of the</text>
  <text start="519.3" dur="6.899">countries and they create humanitarian</text>
  <text start="523.409" dur="5.04">crisis they destroy the economies and</text>
  <text start="526.199" dur="3.75">this is what we are seeing right now and</text>
  <text start="528.449" dur="6.18">I noticed in the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="529.949" dur="9.12">telling Russia to basically set up real</text>
  <text start="534.629" dur="6.481">negotiations to basically stop the war</text>
  <text start="539.069" dur="4.351">in the East because the Mint&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="541.11" dur="5.669">agreement is not a real ceasefire it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.42" dur="5.43">not a real negotiation and now I see</text>
  <text start="546.779" dur="4.11">that they&amp;#39;re starting the propaganda</text>
  <text start="548.85" dur="5.01">that Russia is continually doing things</text>
  <text start="550.889" dur="4.471">and they&amp;#39;re pushing the agenda because</text>
  <text start="553.86" dur="3.959">basically what they want to happen is</text>
  <text start="555.36" dur="4.5">they want to push another offensive and</text>
  <text start="557.819" dur="4.83">we definitely see something is in the</text>
  <text start="559.86" dur="6.09">works at this point we see out in the</text>
  <text start="562.649" dur="5.911">Middle East the problems in Libya arc</text>
  <text start="565.95" dur="5.22">continuing the People&amp;#39;s Government in</text>
  <text start="568.56" dur="6.42">Tripoli the elected government who took</text>
  <text start="571.17" dur="5.61">power did not work with the UN they</text>
  <text start="574.98" dur="4.53">bowed out of the peace negotiations</text>
  <text start="576.78" dur="5.16">because part of the deal was for them to</text>
  <text start="579.51" dur="4.32">give up their power and to allow the</text>
  <text start="581.94" dur="3.81">puppet government to come back into</text>
  <text start="583.83" dur="3.75">Tripoli and take over the power and they</text>
  <text start="585.75" dur="3.54">said no absolutely not so what do we see</text>
  <text start="587.58" dur="4.65">in the corporate media right now we see</text>
  <text start="589.29" dur="5.88">the Islamic state now in Libya they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="592.23" dur="5.06">flexing their muscles because guess what</text>
  <text start="595.17" dur="6.06">the peace negotiations didn&amp;#39;t work and</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="7.63">now they&amp;#39;re on to the next level here we</text>
  <text start="601.23" dur="5.46">see NATO members they are busted for</text>
  <text start="604.92" dur="3.72">supporting the Islamic state and we know</text>
  <text start="606.69" dur="4.8">the coalition forces of the United</text>
  <text start="608.64" dur="5.51">States Israel they&amp;#39;re all supporting the</text>
  <text start="611.49" dur="5.37">Islamic state it is the proxy army and</text>
  <text start="614.15" dur="4.27">look at turkey right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="616.86" dur="4.41">bringing in the force is setting up this</text>
  <text start="618.42" dur="4.47">safe zone because they&amp;#39;re saying yes</text>
  <text start="621.27" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re going after the Islamic state but</text>
  <text start="622.89" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re using this for many</text>
  <text start="626.52" dur="3.87">different agendas and the main agenda is</text>
  <text start="628.53" dur="7.56">to go after Assad they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="630.39" dur="9.09">get to Assad for a very long time we see</text>
  <text start="636.09" dur="6.99">the Pentagon right now is saying that</text>
  <text start="639.48" dur="5.25">China Russia North Korea and other</text>
  <text start="643.08" dur="3.75">countries are cyber attack in the United</text>
  <text start="644.73" dur="5.82">States and the Pentagon wants to come up</text>
  <text start="646.83" dur="6.18">with a cyber weapon so strong that their</text>
  <text start="650.55" dur="4.29">very existence would deter foreign</text>
  <text start="653.01" dur="6.33">governments from attacking the United</text>
  <text start="654.84" dur="6.33">States and right now from all of this we</text>
  <text start="659.34" dur="5.37">see why they want to do this because we</text>
  <text start="661.17" dur="6.36">have to remember and think back when</text>
  <text start="664.71" dur="7.23">they said okay if there is an attack on</text>
  <text start="667.53" dur="9.36">the United States with cyber warfare it</text>
  <text start="671.94" dur="7.5">is an act of war and we can see they are</text>
  <text start="676.89" dur="5.07">following up on this because we see that</text>
  <text start="679.44" dur="4.83">the propaganda was that China was</text>
  <text start="681.96" dur="5.25">hitting the United States they stole 20</text>
  <text start="684.27" dur="6.51">million Americans personal information</text>
  <text start="687.21" dur="6.6">and right now Obama is out there and</text>
  <text start="690.78" dur="5.82">he&amp;#39;s saying that the US must retaliate</text>
  <text start="693.81" dur="5.19">against China for this historic data</text>
  <text start="696.6" dur="3.15">breach so they&amp;#39;re basically pounding on</text>

  <text start="699.75" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re using this to say yes China is</text>
  <text start="702.45" dur="5.19">continually doing this and clack / came</text>
  <text start="705.39" dur="4.47">out and said you know he predicted that</text>
  <text start="707.64" dur="4.08">the number and sophistication of hacking</text>
  <text start="709.86" dur="4.41">aimed at the United States would only</text>
  <text start="711.72" dur="4.02">get worse as time goes on and we see why</text>
  <text start="714.27" dur="2.94">the Pentagon is sitting out there saying</text>
  <text start="715.74" dur="4.92">we need to come up with some type of</text>
  <text start="717.21" dur="6.51">weapon now all of this is being done for</text>
  <text start="720.66" dur="6.99">one reason and one reason only it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="723.72" dur="6.09">get us into war it&amp;#39;s a setup remember</text>
  <text start="727.65" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;ve been provoking China out in the</text>

  <text start="731.88" dur="6.3">Russia they provoke North Korea and none</text>
  <text start="735.33" dur="4.65">of these nations have done anything so</text>
  <text start="738.18" dur="4.44">what do they have to do they have to</text>
  <text start="739.98" dur="5.22">create it they have to make it look like</text>
  <text start="742.62" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re attacking the question is what</text>
  <text start="745.2" dur="7.32">in the world and why would China steal</text>
  <text start="749.13" dur="7.53">this information personal information on</text>
  <text start="752.52" dur="7.29">people to destroy what and also it was a</text>
  <text start="756.66" dur="6.6">surface attack do you really think a</text>
  <text start="759.81" dur="6.029">sophisticated actor would come in and</text>
  <text start="763.26" dur="6.65">leave footprints of where they are do</text>
  <text start="765.839" dur="7.921">you know how easy it is to hide and mask</text>
  <text start="769.91" dur="5.53">where the attacks are coming from well</text>
  <text start="773.76" dur="4.079">that&amp;#39;s what they would that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="775.44" dur="5.1">would do they would not do it from their</text>
  <text start="777.839" dur="5.551">country it would be done from some other</text>
  <text start="780.54" dur="7.97">location you would not know it was them</text>
  <text start="783.39" dur="10.32">if it was a true and real cyber attack</text>
  <text start="788.51" dur="9.1">and we see that at this point they are</text>
  <text start="793.71" dur="6.12">continually pushing the idea because how</text>
  <text start="797.61" dur="3.69">do you prove that it actually came from</text>
  <text start="799.83" dur="2.63">this country actually it&amp;#39;s a perfect</text>
  <text start="801.3" dur="3.3">setup if you really think about it</text>
  <text start="802.46" dur="4.09">because all the government has to do is</text>
  <text start="804.6" dur="4.89">say we were cyber attacked and pulling</text>
  <text start="806.55" dur="6.41">at a country and all they have to do is</text>
  <text start="809.49" dur="6.33">maybe bring out bring down one power</text>
  <text start="812.96" dur="5.2">grid in a certain area and say this was</text>
  <text start="815.82" dur="4.35">China this was Russia all they have to</text>
  <text start="818.16" dur="4.98">do is bring down two or three different</text>
  <text start="820.17" dur="4.38">banks and say yes it was them and now we</text>
  <text start="823.14" dur="4.23">have to lock down the banks that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="824.55" dur="6.12">it would take and we see we are headed</text>
  <text start="827.37" dur="6.21">in that direction and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="830.67" dur="5.04">looking to do is they&amp;#39;re looking to Cree</text>
  <text start="833.58" dur="4.8">something to get through China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="835.71" dur="4.68">firewall now why are they trying to do</text>
  <text start="838.38" dur="5.19">all this well we have to remember that</text>
  <text start="840.39" dur="5.28">the yuan / remember is looking to become</text>
  <text start="843.57" dur="4.77">a reserve currency the IMF is looking at</text>
  <text start="845.67" dur="4.62">this and this is coming up this fall</text>
  <text start="848.34" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re getting closer and closer to this</text>
  <text start="850.29" dur="6.12">time period and eventually China most</text>
  <text start="853.5" dur="5.58">likely will back this currency with gold</text>
  <text start="856.41" dur="4.08">and again I said this many times the</text>
  <text start="859.08" dur="4.77">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="860.49" dur="6.09">do not want this to happen now the</text>
  <text start="863.85" dur="5.78">homeland security they are warning now</text>
  <text start="866.58" dur="7.92">police agencies to be on the lookout for</text>
  <text start="869.63" dur="6.85">drones and they&amp;#39;re saying that these</text>
  <text start="874.5" dur="3.99">people out in this in the United States</text>
  <text start="876.48" dur="6.93">could be flying drones and they could be</text>
  <text start="878.49" dur="6.81">attacking people with the drones they</text>
  <text start="883.41" dur="4.05">have no evidence that anyone is actually</text>
  <text start="885.3" dur="6.06">really doing this they&amp;#39;re just giving</text>
  <text start="887.46" dur="6.78">this as a warning they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="891.36" dur="4.37">adversaries could use these drones to</text>
  <text start="894.24" dur="4.71">advance terrorist and criminal</text>
  <text start="895.73" dur="4.87">activities but there&amp;#39;s no threats or any</text>
  <text start="898.95" dur="4.14">information that this is actually</text>
  <text start="900.6" dur="4.26">happening so what does this tell us this</text>
  <text start="903.09" dur="4.5">tells us they have something in the</text>
  <text start="904.86" dur="4.47">works to show that yes people are using</text>
  <text start="907.59" dur="5.49">drones and this most likely will be a</text>
  <text start="909.33" dur="5.76">false flag event we&amp;#39;re moving into a</text>
  <text start="913.08" dur="4.95">time period where the economy is</text>
  <text start="915.09" dur="7.59">completely falling apart and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.03" dur="6.18">ramping up this next event listen</text>
