  <text start="61.3" dur="5.94">indicated that major inflation is headed</text>
  <text start="63.97" dur="5.79">our way let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="67.24" dur="5.67">collapse financial news now as we</text>
  <text start="69.76" dur="6.96">continually follow this economy we are</text>
  <text start="72.91" dur="6.93">realizing that each and every sector of</text>
  <text start="76.72" dur="4.41">the economy is now failing now in the</text>
  <text start="79.84" dur="4.92">beginning when we started looking at</text>
  <text start="81.13" dur="5.76">this we saw one or two and it creeped up</text>
  <text start="84.76" dur="4.68">to you know four or five and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="86.89" dur="5.1">starting to see that all the different</text>
  <text start="89.44" dur="5.94">economic sectors now they&amp;#39;re all showing</text>
  <text start="91.99" dur="8.64">signs that this economy is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="95.38" dur="8.7">it&amp;#39;s imploding it&amp;#39;s collapsing and we</text>
  <text start="100.63" dur="7.08">can see right now that people when they</text>
  <text start="104.08" dur="5.46">lose their job they don&amp;#39;t want to you</text>
  <text start="107.71" dur="3.87">know take their money go out and spend</text>
  <text start="109.54" dur="4.83">we see it in retail we see stores</text>
  <text start="111.58" dur="5.61">closing and then of course no one saw it</text>
  <text start="114.37" dur="5.01">in the re in the restaurant industry</text>
  <text start="117.19" dur="4.47">right off the bat people like well the</text>
  <text start="119.38" dur="5.04">economy&amp;#39;s still doing well restaurants</text>
  <text start="121.66" dur="6.63">are doing - still doing well so there</text>
  <text start="124.42" dur="6.75">really can&amp;#39;t be a problem well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="128.29" dur="5.16">starting to see now that this is why</text>
  <text start="131.17" dur="3.93">this is the way it happens where people</text>
  <text start="133.45" dur="3.569">lose their jobs or people get a</text>
  <text start="135.1" dur="6.6">part-time job and they say you know</text>
  <text start="137.019" dur="6.931">something I don&amp;#39;t need the HD TV I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="141.7" dur="4.47">need a blu-ray player but you know what</text>
  <text start="143.95" dur="7.02">I still need food I will still go out to</text>
  <text start="146.17" dur="6.48">eat and they continually keep that up as</text>
  <text start="150.97" dur="3.72">more and more people lose their jobs as</text>
  <text start="152.65" dur="4.619">people find it more difficult to find</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="4.65">jobs as people are working the part-time</text>
  <text start="157.269" dur="4.411">jobs they start to cut back in other</text>
  <text start="159.34" dur="5.84">areas because we see other things</text>
  <text start="161.68" dur="11.79">increasing in cost you know insurance</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="11.74">rent mortgage electric gas so on and we</text>
  <text start="173.47" dur="6.269">see in the restaurant industry that the</text>
  <text start="176.92" dur="3.76">data right now which is coming from the</text>
  <text start="179.739" dur="2.5">National Restaurant</text>
  <text start="180.68" dur="2.88">Association and it&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="182.239" dur="2.37">restaurant Performance Index and we</text>
  <text start="183.56" dur="5.37">talked about it before</text>
  <text start="184.609" dur="7.83">well it&amp;#39;s painting a disturbing picture</text>
  <text start="188.93" dur="5.789">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="192.439" dur="4.981">in August restaurant sales they</text>
  <text start="194.719" dur="4.08">completely tumbled in August they slid</text>
  <text start="197.42" dur="4.92">to the lowest level since the financial</text>
  <text start="198.799" dur="6.871">crisis and the Restaurant Association</text>
  <text start="202.34" dur="5.369">reports that due in large part to the</text>
  <text start="205.67" dur="4.17">Kleins in both same store sales and</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="3.78">customer traffic the National Restaurant</text>
  <text start="209.84" dur="6.17">Association and restaurant performance</text>
  <text start="211.489" dur="9.541">index fell below 100 in August now in</text>
  <text start="216.01" dur="8.8">September we see that this has slid even</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="8.4">further and what this is telling us is</text>
  <text start="224.81" dur="7.349">that the situation is getting worse</text>
  <text start="229.43" dur="5.279">as time goes on because August</text>
  <text start="232.159" dur="4.591">represents the fourth consecutive month</text>
  <text start="234.709" dur="4.01">in which restaurant operators reported a</text>
  <text start="236.75" dur="6.59">net decline in customer traffic</text>
  <text start="238.719" dur="9.031">September is the fifth consecutive month</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="7.45">so we&amp;#39;re seeing retail has been hit the</text>
  <text start="247.75" dur="4.69">restaurants have been hit and most</text>
  <text start="250.79" dur="3.289">likely we&amp;#39;re going to see restaurants</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to start shutting down</text>
  <text start="254.079" dur="5.761">just like we&amp;#39;ve seen stores shutting</text>
  <text start="256.82" dur="7.02">down and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="7.48">manufacturing industrial production it</text>
  <text start="263.84" dur="7.169">is just all declining right now now</text>
  <text start="267.32" dur="6.42">industrial production well that has just</text>
  <text start="271.009" dur="6.181">contracted for the 13th straight month</text>
  <text start="273.74" dur="6.09">in a row this is the longest non</text>
  <text start="277.19" dur="8.52">recessionary streak in US history</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="7.649">and we can see right now that all of</text>
  <text start="285.71" dur="5.489">this is pointing to one thing and one</text>
  <text start="287.479" dur="7.91">thing only that is an economic collapse</text>
  <text start="291.199" dur="6.291">that in many of these economic</text>
  <text start="295.389" dur="5.62">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="6.58">they are either equal to or worse than</text>
  <text start="301.009" dur="5.611">2008 right now and the only thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.07" dur="5.55">keeping the economy looking like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="5.13">doing much much better is the ability to</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="4.86">manipulate the stock market the ability</text>
  <text start="311.75" dur="6.6">to manipulate unemployment the ability</text>
  <text start="314.48" dur="7.23">to manipulate GDP and all of these</text>
  <text start="318.35" dur="5.19">numbers are manipulated because what the</text>
  <text start="321.71" dur="5.04">US government what the central bankers</text>
  <text start="323.54" dur="6.78">learned back in 2008 was how to</text>
  <text start="326.75" dur="7.62">manipulate the economy to create an</text>
  <text start="330.32" dur="9.3">illusion that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="9.06">and they&amp;#39;ve done this very well and most</text>
  <text start="339.62" dur="8.24">of the population believes that the</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="7.89">economy is doing well and many people</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="6.64">believe it but many people also feel</text>
  <text start="351.32" dur="5.91">that something is wrong because those</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="4.5">people who have still have jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.23" dur="3.57">putting out their resume and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359" dur="4.74">saying why can&amp;#39;t I find another job</text>
  <text start="360.8" dur="4.92">equal to what I have or something better</text>
  <text start="363.74" dur="4.11">because in the past you were able to</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="6.93">send out your resume and either get the</text>
  <text start="367.85" dur="7.89">same type of job or you go and find the</text>
  <text start="372.65" dur="4.44">same job with higher pay that&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="375.74" dur="5.19">the main reasons why you would like to</text>
  <text start="377.09" dur="8.93">leave a job but many people cannot find</text>
  <text start="380.93" dur="9.71">this we see that the Empire fed well</text>
  <text start="386.02" dur="8.02">there was a dead cat bounce back in June</text>
  <text start="390.64" dur="7">but since that time period the Empire</text>
  <text start="394.04" dur="7.23">Fed has been tinkin declining they were</text>
  <text start="397.64" dur="8.25">expecting a positive one it dropped to</text>
  <text start="401.27" dur="9.57">negative six point eight and we can see</text>
  <text start="405.89" dur="7.17">right now that the Empire fed industrial</text>
  <text start="410.84" dur="5.7">production the restaurant Performance</text>
  <text start="413.06" dur="6.42">Index retail manufacturing corporate</text>
  <text start="416.54" dur="6.48">defaults delinquencies in the auto</text>
  <text start="419.48" dur="6.48">industry the derivative bubble the stock</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="7.77">bubble the Treasury bubble all of this</text>
  <text start="425.96" dur="6.87">is coming to a head right now how much</text>
  <text start="430.79" dur="5.19">longer can the central banks keep this</text>
  <text start="432.83" dur="5.97">up most likely not that much longer and</text>
  <text start="435.98" dur="7.13">we talked about this before the central</text>
  <text start="438.8" dur="7.86">banks they need more power they need</text>
  <text start="443.11" dur="5.35">more power to control the economy</text>
  <text start="446.66" dur="7.05">because they know</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="8.07">the people will not be able to push this</text>
  <text start="453.71" dur="5.34">economy to the next level and what does</text>
  <text start="456.53" dur="4.35">that really mean it means keep the</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="3.75">manipulation going to make it look like</text>
  <text start="460.88" dur="2.85">the economy&amp;#39;s doing well and they know</text>
  <text start="462.8" dur="2.85">that people aren&amp;#39;t going to be doing</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="4.62">this because too many people are losing</text>
  <text start="465.65" dur="6.51">jobs too many retail stores are closing</text>
  <text start="468.35" dur="7.1">and all the indicators are showing us</text>
  <text start="472.16" dur="8.33">that this economy is dead in the water</text>
  <text start="475.45" dur="8.8">now there are two major central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.49" dur="5.68">insiders inside the central banks in the</text>
  <text start="484.25" dur="4.35">Bank of England and the US Federal</text>
  <text start="486.17" dur="7.02">Reserve they have given clear signals</text>
  <text start="488.6" dur="8.27">that they want inflation and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="493.19" dur="7.56">prepared to tolerate higher inflation</text>
  <text start="496.87" dur="7.3">over the next few years than they</text>
  <text start="500.75" dur="5.73">originally wanted they don&amp;#39;t mind if it</text>
  <text start="504.17" dur="6.42">goes much much higher now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.48" dur="6.3">really saying is that inflation is going</text>
  <text start="510.59" dur="5.16">to happen anyway because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.78" dur="4.41">happening around the world is that those</text>
  <text start="515.75" dur="3.66">countries that are dealing with the</text>
  <text start="517.19" dur="5.46">petrodollar those countries that keep</text>
  <text start="519.41" dur="4.47">the dollar in reserve those dollars are</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="3.21">going to start floating back to the</text>
  <text start="523.88" dur="4.38">United States because we can see right</text>
  <text start="525.86" dur="5.93">now that the United States has lost</text>
  <text start="528.26" dur="6.45">control in the Middle East and once</text>
  <text start="531.79" dur="5.02">control is completely lost countries are</text>
  <text start="534.71" dur="4.8">going to no longer deal in the dollar to</text>
  <text start="536.81" dur="5.31">sell their natural resources and we see</text>
  <text start="539.51" dur="4.92">that the Federal Reserve the Bank of</text>
  <text start="542.12" dur="4.41">England we can see the Bank of Japan and</text>
  <text start="544.43" dur="4.11">the rest of the central banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="546.53" dur="5.69">gonna have no choice but the United</text>
  <text start="548.54" dur="8.43">States is going to see inflation and</text>
  <text start="552.22" dur="7.09">once inflation starts they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="556.97" dur="5.76">to be able to just turn a switch and say</text>
  <text start="559.31" dur="6.18">okay this is all we want what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="562.73" dur="8.31">happen next is that inflation is going</text>
  <text start="565.49" dur="6.27">to continue on it&amp;#39;s going to run hot for</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="5.72">a while</text>
  <text start="571.76" dur="7.98">might even turn into hyperinflation and</text>
  <text start="576.76" dur="6.78">what this really means is that the value</text>
  <text start="579.74" dur="6.69">of the dollar is going to decrease</text>
  <text start="583.54" dur="7.09">which means products are going to be</text>
  <text start="586.43" dur="7.86">much much more expensive and we can see</text>
  <text start="590.63" dur="5.67">right now that the central banks are out</text>
  <text start="594.29" dur="4.32">there telling people this that they want</text>
  <text start="596.3" dur="5.909">inflation they don&amp;#39;t mind inflation and</text>
  <text start="598.61" dur="8.339">it&amp;#39;s coming because there&amp;#39;s no way to</text>
  <text start="602.209" dur="7.981">stop it and we see right now once they</text>
  <text start="606.949" dur="5.491">let the genie out of the bottle and all</text>
  <text start="610.19" dur="4.86">these dollars start coming flooding back</text>
  <text start="612.44" dur="8.13">the United States it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="615.05" dur="10.349">difficult for people to survive and at</text>
  <text start="620.57" dur="7.079">this point this signal from the central</text>
  <text start="625.399" dur="5.731">banks should tell you something it</text>
  <text start="627.649" dur="6.391">should tell you to start to purchase the</text>
  <text start="631.13" dur="5.67">items now because you don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="5.88">caught in a situation where all of a</text>
  <text start="636.8" dur="6.089">sudden you want to go and purchase food</text>
  <text start="639.92" dur="3.65">and you find out that bread is 50</text>
  <text start="642.889" dur="4.38">dollars</text>
  <text start="643.57" dur="6.94">milk is 90 dollars because this</text>
  <text start="647.269" dur="4.56">eventually will happen because once</text>
  <text start="650.51" dur="3.99">inflation hit and we&amp;#39;ve seen it before</text>
  <text start="651.829" dur="5.401">this is not the first time we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="654.5" dur="5.209">in Germany we&amp;#39;ve seen it we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="657.23" dur="7.109">around the world we&amp;#39;ve seen it back in</text>
  <text start="659.709" dur="7.69">the 1970s but of course this was the</text>
  <text start="664.339" dur="6.831">beginning of the finance system but this</text>
  <text start="667.399" dur="7.021">is the end game of the finance system</text>
  <text start="671.17" dur="6.52">where we have so much debt where wages</text>
  <text start="674.42" dur="5.97">are going the opposite way they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="677.69" dur="5.639">declining where we have so many bubbles</text>
  <text start="680.39" dur="7.35">that are ready to pop and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="683.329" dur="7.95">control the system so right now we see</text>
  <text start="687.74" dur="6.87">many things occurring all at once we</text>
  <text start="691.279" dur="7.17">have the elections coming up and we know</text>
  <text start="694.61" dur="6.029">right now that the u.s. those people in</text>
  <text start="698.449" dur="4.471">power the elite the globalist a shadow</text>
  <text start="700.639" dur="5.88">government they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever</text>
  <text start="702.92" dur="6.69">they possibly can to make sure they have</text>
  <text start="706.519" dur="6.5">the puppet in place that will take</text>
  <text start="709.61" dur="6.27">orders if they cannot get that puppet</text>
  <text start="713.019" dur="4.81">yes and I call them puppets</text>
  <text start="715.88" dur="4.709">because they&amp;#39;re not really in control of</text>
  <text start="717.829" dur="7.161">what&amp;#39;s going on here if they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="720.589" dur="6.87">that puppet in power they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="724.99" dur="6.19">postpone these elections or if they do</text>
  <text start="727.459" dur="5.61">let the elections go through most likely</text>
  <text start="731.18" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;ll get rid of that candidate that</text>
  <text start="733.069" dur="5.7">they don&amp;#39;t want if that candidate</text>
  <text start="735.41" dur="5.25">actually makes it through but we can see</text>
  <text start="738.769" dur="4.32">already they&amp;#39;re laying the groundwork</text>
  <text start="740.66" dur="4.7">for what is coming and they realize that</text>
  <text start="743.089" dur="4.62">this economy that we&amp;#39;re in right now is</text>
  <text start="745.36" dur="5.77">not going to be able to continually chug</text>
  <text start="747.709" dur="6.87">along here it&amp;#39;s going to collapse one</text>
  <text start="751.13" dur="5.42">way or another they&amp;#39;d rather have it</text>
  <text start="754.579" dur="4.891">their way where they can bring it down</text>
  <text start="756.55" dur="6.64">where they can control it as it comes</text>
  <text start="759.47" dur="6.479">comes down where they can say listen the</text>
  <text start="763.19" dur="4.589">financial system was hit we know who did</text>
  <text start="765.949" dur="5.101">it and of course as you know once they</text>
  <text start="767.779" dur="4.951">tell you this it&amp;#39;s completely fake phony</text>
  <text start="771.05" dur="3.51">and false because you can&amp;#39;t just figure</text>
  <text start="772.73" dur="3.89">it out that fast but they&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="774.56" dur="4.139">everything prepared and ready to go</text>
  <text start="776.62" dur="7.899">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this for a</text>
