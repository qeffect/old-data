  <text start="177.69" dur="6.75">the world and what are we really saying</text>
  <text start="179.16" dur="8.96">well we are seeing that us construction</text>
  <text start="184.44" dur="7.22">equipment fell by twenty-five percent in</text>
  <text start="188.12" dur="6.16">2013 sales in every region of the world</text>

  <text start="201.69" dur="4.38">these countries won&amp;#39;t need another</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="4.83">bailout but again all of this was a</text>
  <text start="206.07" dur="4.32">complete lie and we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="208.11" dur="5.31">absolute opposite of what they were</text>
  <text start="210.39" dur="5.03">talking about exports the Canada the</text>
  <text start="213.42" dur="5.34">number one market for us make</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="6.039">construction equipment fell sixteen</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="5.13">percent last year after plummeting</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="3.901">thirty-eight percent in 2009 during the</text>
  <text start="223.89" dur="5.16">dark days of the worldwide economic</text>
  <text start="225.36" dur="6.75">downturn expert exports of us made</text>
  <text start="229.05" dur="6.08">construction went on a three-year tier</text>
  <text start="232.11" dur="5.31">rising twenty-eight percent in 2010</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="5.829">forty-three percent in twenty eleven and</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="7.83">thirteen percent in 2012 can anyone say</text>
  <text start="240.959" dur="7.081">QE easy money pumping up the economy and</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s why you saw all of this happen</text>
  <text start="248.04" dur="5.46">the stock market went up gold went down</text>
  <text start="250.59" dur="5.22">and they tried to pump up the housing</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="5.459">market and they were printing like crazy</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="8.55">but they see now that the effects of QA</text>
  <text start="258.959" dur="9.301">are starting to not work as well as they</text>
  <text start="264.36" dur="5.91">thought and there is a shelf life of QE</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="3.9">and this is why they are tapering</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="3.61">because they realize it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="272.16" dur="4">do much more for the</text>
  <text start="273.88" dur="6.06">me so what&amp;#39;s what why should they</text>
  <text start="276.16" dur="6.96">continually print money so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="5.58">happening is they&amp;#39;re slowing down the</text>
  <text start="283.12" dur="6.63">printing and they are setting this up</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="7.11">for a major event because again they do</text>
  <text start="289.75" dur="4.26">not want to be blamed for this economic</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="4.62">collapse and I&amp;#39;ve said this many many</text>
  <text start="294.01" dur="4.62">times the US government and the Fed do</text>
  <text start="297.25" dur="4.38">not want to be blamed now if they</text>
  <text start="298.63" dur="6.96">continually printed and they continually</text>
  <text start="301.63" dur="5.82">pump QE up and the economy collapsed</text>
  <text start="305.59" dur="4.8">because again there&amp;#39;s a shelf life and</text>
  <text start="307.45" dur="4.35">is just going to do so much everyone</text>
  <text start="310.39" dur="3.27">would turn to the Fed and the US</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="3.6">government say hey what happened here</text>
  <text start="313.66" dur="3.74">you said things are getting better this</text>
  <text start="315.4" dur="6.21">is why you were printing money but now</text>
  <text start="317.4" dur="7.45">since they are tapering and showing the</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="6.93">people that the economy is recovering on</text>
  <text start="324.85" dur="5.91">itself there&amp;#39;s no more they&amp;#39;ve done what</text>
  <text start="328.54" dur="5.22">they needed to do and they made the</text>
  <text start="330.76" dur="4.92">economy recover and now they can start</text>
  <text start="333.76" dur="4.17">to taper and they&amp;#39;re showing everyone</text>
  <text start="335.68" dur="5.22">that they&amp;#39;re tapering and the housing</text>
  <text start="337.93" dur="6.09">market is booming the stock market is</text>
  <text start="340.9" dur="7.05">continually going up and look we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="344.02" dur="7.56">this fantastic recovery you see it</text>
  <text start="347.95" dur="6.36">worked but of course no one realizes</text>
  <text start="351.58" dur="6.24">this in the dark shadow of the night</text>
  <text start="354.31" dur="7.53">they&amp;#39;re planning a false flag event to</text>
  <text start="357.82" dur="6.03">cover up this entire economic collapse</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="4.86">and this is what people do not</text>
  <text start="363.85" dur="7.83">understand because they do not want to</text>
  <text start="366.7" dur="8.34">be blamed for what is coming now we</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="5.99">understand that housing is really not</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="6.59">doing well but all of a sudden today</text>

  <text start="391.68" dur="7.12">nine point six percent in February so we</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="5.67">have to think to ourselves all this</text>
  <text start="398.8" dur="6.45">propaganda about the weather being a</text>
  <text start="402.31" dur="5.819">problem is really not a problem because</text>

  <text start="518.62" dur="5.43">twenty-five percent and have the credit</text>
  <text start="521.139" dur="4.291">now to go out and buy a home and of</text>
  <text start="524.05" dur="4.95">course we understand what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="537.519" dur="4.351">now that it&amp;#39;s the boomerang effect these</text>
  <text start="540.579" dur="3.901">buyers who</text>
  <text start="541.87" dur="5.76">no five years ago four years ago are</text>
  <text start="544.48" dur="8.16">coming back into the market but those</text>
  <text start="547.63" dur="7.56">people who have filed foreclosure they</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="4.47">need to really wait seven years before</text>
  <text start="555.19" dur="4.89">they can purchase a home so how are they</text>
  <text start="557.11" dur="5.3">getting around this hmm those people who</text>
  <text start="560.08" dur="4.89">sold their houses due to a short sale</text>
  <text start="562.41" dur="5.59">who&amp;#39;ve lost their money and usually when</text>
  <text start="564.97" dur="6.75">you do a short sale what happens is you</text>
  <text start="568" dur="5.46">the banks make up the difference of what</text>
  <text start="571.72" dur="5.84">you own the mortgage so any down payment</text>
  <text start="573.46" dur="6.87">that you had on the house you lose and</text>
  <text start="577.56" dur="5.41">the bank makes up the difference so if</text>
  <text start="580.33" dur="4.259">you owned a house and you had a map</text>
  <text start="582.97" dur="3.48">mortgage of three hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="584.589" dur="4.111">dollars and you put a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="586.45" dur="4.41">dollars down well that hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="588.7" dur="4.68">dollars is gone and they&amp;#39;re short</text>
  <text start="590.86" dur="6.09">selling the house and the house is being</text>
  <text start="593.38" dur="5.43">sold for less than the mortgage price so</text>
  <text start="596.95" dur="6.06">the banks have to make up the difference</text>
  <text start="598.81" dur="6.6">for that and they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us</text>
  <text start="603.01" dur="5.1">right now that these people who sold</text>
  <text start="605.41" dur="5.429">their house using a short sale have to</text>
  <text start="608.11" dur="5.43">wait two years and now they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="610.839" dur="5.311">purchase a home so you know they lost</text>
  <text start="613.54" dur="5.13">their job they sold our house via a</text>
  <text start="616.15" dur="4.23">short sale they didn&amp;#39;t have to go into</text>
  <text start="618.67" dur="3.48">foreclosure their credit is ruined they</text>
  <text start="620.38" dur="3.51">probably have other credit card problems</text>
  <text start="622.15" dur="4.17">and things like that they probably have</text>
  <text start="623.89" dur="4.889">a job now making less money or have two</text>
  <text start="626.32" dur="5.25">three part-time jobs but they&amp;#39;ve saved</text>
  <text start="628.779" dur="5.581">enough now to purchase a new home and</text>
  <text start="631.57" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re ready to purchase this is this</text>
  <text start="634.36" dur="4.02">is what they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="635.38" dur="5.07">everyone that things are getting better</text>
  <text start="638.38" dur="6.03">and they&amp;#39;re trying to push this out as</text>
  <text start="640.45" dur="6.6">propaganda that this is why the housing</text>
  <text start="644.41" dur="4.86">market is bouncing back now it really</text>
  <text start="647.05" dur="5.36">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense because mortgage</text>
  <text start="649.27" dur="6.03">applications plunge most in three months</text>
  <text start="652.41" dur="5.44">hmm mordric mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="655.3" dur="6.15">tumbled eight-point-five percent this</text>
  <text start="657.85" dur="6.06">week so hmm where are they getting these</text>
  <text start="661.45" dur="6.06">mortgages and we also have to remember</text>
  <text start="663.91" dur="5.57">that JPMorgan is laying off from their</text>
  <text start="667.51" dur="5.25">mortgage department they laid off god</text>
  <text start="669.48" dur="5.17">thousands upon thousands of people bank</text>

  <text start="674.65" dur="3.75">well</text>

  <text start="678.4" dur="6">the housing market was completely in</text>
  <text start="681.24" dur="5.349">pretty much done the housing bubble is</text>
  <text start="684.4" dur="3.3">popping and they wanted to get out of</text>
  <text start="686.589" dur="2.671">these markets but they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="687.7" dur="3.6">convince us that things are getting</text>

  <text start="791.98" dur="3.9">in two thousand eight actually it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="793.81" dur="5.01">opposite of what they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="795.88" dur="5.61">really the not they see us housing</text>
  <text start="798.82" dur="5.99">recovery but it&amp;#39;s the US housing to</text>
  <text start="801.49" dur="6.73">decline because I remember back in</text>
  <text start="804.81" dur="6.95">2007-2008 when I was selling my house</text>

  <text start="823.4" dur="3.45">said well there&amp;#39;s something wrong up</text>

  <text start="850.79" dur="7.59">what those will be coming down very</text>
  <text start="853.49" dur="7.35">shortly now I mentioned this a lot in my</text>

  <text start="948.779" dur="5.461">they&amp;#39;re trying to get rid of the Fourth</text>
  <text start="950.37" dur="7.469">Amendment now let me just say the Fourth</text>
  <text start="954.24" dur="5.37">Amendment says the following the right</text>
  <text start="957.839" dur="4.261">of the people to be secure in their</text>
  <text start="959.61" dur="4.2">persons houses papers and effects</text>
  <text start="962.1" dur="4.409">against unreasonable searches and</text>

  <text start="974.459" dur="5.55">be searched and the persons or things to</text>
  <text start="976.35" dur="5.549">be seized now the US Supreme Court has</text>
  <text start="980.009" dur="4.291">ruled that the police may search a home</text>
  <text start="981.899" dur="4.68">without obtaining a warrant despite the</text>
  <text start="984.3" dur="4.56">objection of one occupant if that</text>
  <text start="986.579" dur="6.18">occupant has been removed from the</text>
  <text start="988.86" dur="5.279">premises again this goes down and</text>
  <text start="992.759" dur="3.841">they&amp;#39;re saying that if there are two</text>
  <text start="994.139" dur="4.111">people in the home and one person says</text>
  <text start="996.6" dur="4.44">yes you can come in and the other person</text>
  <text start="998.25" dur="4.709">says no you can&amp;#39;t the police now are</text>
  <text start="1001.04" dur="4.049">allowed to enter your home and search</text>
  <text start="1002.959" dur="4.651">your home but when I read the Fourth</text>
  <text start="1005.089" dur="4.85">Amendment it doesn&amp;#39;t say anything about</text>
  <text start="1007.61" dur="6.57">consent it doesn&amp;#39;t say anything about</text>
  <text start="1009.939" dur="7.811">any of this it says if they want to come</text>
  <text start="1014.18" dur="7.139">into your house and search it they need</text>
  <text start="1017.75" dur="8.159">a warrant they need to go in front of a</text>
  <text start="1021.319" dur="6.181">judge and get a warrant so if one person</text>
  <text start="1025.909" dur="3.9">in that home in this court this court</text>
  <text start="1027.5" dur="5.13">case was overruled because in the</text>
  <text start="1029.809" dur="4.471">previous court case it said that if one</text>
  <text start="1032.63" dur="3.419">person was in the house the other person</text>
  <text start="1034.28" dur="3.059">there are two people in the house and</text>
  <text start="1036.049" dur="2.851">one said you can come in the other one</text>
  <text start="1037.339" dur="4.98">said you couldn&amp;#39;t the police were not</text>
  <text start="1038.9" dur="7.259">allowed to come in because according to</text>
  <text start="1042.319" dur="5.73">the Fourth Amendment now they overturn</text>
  <text start="1046.159" dur="3.691">that case and said you know what the</text>
  <text start="1048.049" dur="4.62">police are allowed to come into your</text>
  <text start="1049.85" dur="6.27">home so they are definitely removing our</text>
  <text start="1052.669" dur="6.031">rights and again they want to enter</text>
  <text start="1056.12" dur="5.4">people&amp;#39;s homes because they understand</text>
  <text start="1058.7" dur="5.91">when the collapse comes they need to go</text>
  <text start="1061.52" dur="4.769">out there and move in and get into the</text>
  <text start="1064.61" dur="5.309">people&amp;#39;s homes and they could care less</text>
  <text start="1066.289" dur="5.971">about what the Constitution says now</text>
  <text start="1069.919" dur="4.231">Connecticut is out there and they are</text>
  <text start="1072.26" dur="3.57">telling their unregistered gun owners</text>
  <text start="1074.15" dur="5.32">because of the new laws</text>
  <text start="1075.83" dur="6.1">that they better turn in their weapons</text>
  <text start="1079.47" dur="4.95">the state of Connecticut is now</text>
  <text start="1081.93" dur="4.89">demanding that gun owners across the</text>
  <text start="1084.42" dur="6.03">state turn in all newly ban unregistered</text>
  <text start="1086.82" dur="5.7">firearms and magazines or face felony</text>
  <text start="1090.45" dur="3.87">arrest and of course they&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="1092.52" dur="3.99">after everyone again this is being done</text>
  <text start="1094.32" dur="5.55">on a state-by-state basis because the</text>
  <text start="1096.51" dur="6.18">federal government tried with everything</text>
  <text start="1099.87" dur="5.46">they possibly knew how to do even with</text>
  <text start="1102.69" dur="5.4">all the false flag events they tried to</text>
  <text start="1105.33" dur="5.13">get the Dianne Feinstein and the UN arms</text>
  <text start="1108.09" dur="4.38">treaty past but they couldn&amp;#39;t so they</text>
  <text start="1110.46" dur="4.17">are pending in the Senate because they</text>
  <text start="1112.47" dur="4.11">want to disarm the American people and</text>
  <text start="1114.63" dur="4.17">this is their entire goal and this is</text>
  <text start="1116.58" dur="5.88">why we&amp;#39;re going to see another false</text>
  <text start="1118.8" dur="5.97">flag event which will be very terrible</text>
  <text start="1122.46" dur="3.87">it will be horrific and we will know</text>
  <text start="1124.77" dur="4.53">this is the one because you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="1126.33" dur="7.05">President Obama right on TV just like in</text>
  <text start="1129.3" dur="6.81">Sandy Hook telling you that we need to</text>
  <text start="1133.38" dur="5.49">pass the new gun laws and we need to</text>
  <text start="1136.11" dur="4.74">pass the UN arms treaty and just so</text>
  <text start="1138.87" dur="4.17">happens we have these pending in the</text>
  <text start="1140.85" dur="4.68">Senate and we need to get these through</text>
  <text start="1143.04" dur="4.65">and this once these get through this</text>
  <text start="1145.53" dur="5.04">will be the end and they will believe</text>
  <text start="1147.69" dur="5.94">that they have overridden the Second</text>
  <text start="1150.57" dur="6.03">Amendment within this process but again</text>
  <text start="1153.63" dur="5.55">they haven&amp;#39;t because the rights cannot</text>
  <text start="1156.6" dur="4.77">be taken away the only way they can</text>
  <text start="1159.18" dur="4.11">remove an amendment is with another</text>
  <text start="1161.37" dur="3.42">amendment and again all the states i</text>
  <text start="1163.29" dur="3.36">think three-quarters of the states have</text>
  <text start="1164.79" dur="4.17">to ratify the new amendment canceling</text>
  <text start="1166.65" dur="5.7">out the other amendment but again most</text>
  <text start="1168.96" dur="5.79">of the people will believe this and they</text>
  <text start="1172.35" dur="5.37">will go along with this and this is what</text>
  <text start="1174.75" dur="5.88">they are trying to do now we understand</text>
  <text start="1177.72" dur="5.73">that obamacare I am NOT for this I said</text>
  <text start="1180.63" dur="4.62">this many times it is a cash grab they</text>
  <text start="1183.45" dur="3.9">just want your tax money they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1185.25" dur="4.89">about your health benefits and we see</text>
  <text start="1187.35" dur="4.62">all across the United States many states</text>
  <text start="1190.14" dur="3.42">are having problems the enrollments</text>
  <text start="1191.97" dur="3.09">aren&amp;#39;t there people aren&amp;#39;t paying they</text>
  <text start="1193.56" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t have the money and when they</text>
  <text start="1195.06" dur="4.65">receive these benefits they realize the</text>
  <text start="1197.55" dur="4.68">deductible is very high and they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="1199.71" dur="3.9">i can&amp;#39;t pay for this this is this is not</text>
  <text start="1202.23" dur="3.18">giving me anything i have to lay out</text>
  <text start="1203.61" dur="4.32">another three thousand dollars before</text>
  <text start="1205.41" dur="3.72">the insurance even kicks in and what</text>
  <text start="1207.93" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="1209.13" dur="6.36">is that the IRS is out there telling</text>
  <text start="1212.04" dur="6.42">everyone that they&amp;#39;re warning the</text>
  <text start="1215.49" dur="4.92">Americans that on their 2014 tax returns</text>
  <text start="1218.46" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;ll be asked about their health</text>
  <text start="1220.41" dur="5.34">insurance coverage your 2014 tax return</text>
  <text start="1223.59" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;ll ask if you had insurance coverage</text>
  <text start="1225.75" dur="5.19">or qualified for an exemption if not you</text>
  <text start="1229.08" dur="5.22">may owe a shared responsibility payment</text>
  <text start="1230.94" dur="5.1">when you file in 2015 because this is</text>
  <text start="1234.3" dur="4.8">all they&amp;#39;re concerned about they&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="1236.04" dur="5.16">concerned about getting your money and</text>
  <text start="1239.1" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re realizing right now that most of</text>
  <text start="1241.2" dur="4.23">the people have not signed up for health</text>
  <text start="1243.15" dur="4.5">insurance so if you haven&amp;#39;t signed up</text>
  <text start="1245.43" dur="3.96">for health insurance you rejected health</text>
  <text start="1247.65" dur="5.28">insurance if you rejected health</text>
  <text start="1249.39" dur="6.63">insurance you have to pay a tax and this</text>
  <text start="1252.93" dur="7.68">is what they want from you they want</text>
  <text start="1256.02" dur="8.88">this money now the IRS is saying that if</text>
  <text start="1260.61" dur="7.62">you can&amp;#39;t afford to pay the the health</text>
  <text start="1264.9" dur="5.79">insurance we will find you because you</text>
  <text start="1268.23" dur="4.74">can&amp;#39;t afford to pay that makes sense</text>
  <text start="1270.69" dur="3.66">right if you can&amp;#39;t if you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1272.97" dur="2.34">enough money and that&amp;#39;s your reason why</text>
  <text start="1274.35" dur="4.25">you couldn&amp;#39;t get the health insurance</text>
  <text start="1275.31" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re just going to find you more money</text>
  <text start="1278.6" dur="5.47">because you didn&amp;#39;t have money to pay for</text>
  <text start="1280.65" dur="6.03">the health insurance and these fines are</text>
  <text start="1284.07" dur="5.1">as follows one percent of your household</text>

  <text start="2412.5" dur="4.32">buildup in Jordan this is why you see</text>
  <text start="2414.84" dur="4.65">the military assets moved into Jordan</text>

  <text start="2444.33" dur="5.79">the table so we can see and we have to</text>
  <text start="2447.66" dur="5.04">look down the road here that they have a</text>
  <text start="2450.12" dur="6.09">certain time frame to do this because</text>
  <text start="2452.7" dur="6.3">the elections come back in mid-2014 and</text>
  <text start="2456.21" dur="5.97">the other thing that is very interesting</text>
  <text start="2459" dur="8.28">about this is that the Fed wants to be</text>
  <text start="2462.18" dur="6.99">done with their tapering by mid-2014 so</text>
  <text start="2467.28" dur="5.34">what does that mean like I said before</text>
  <text start="2469.17" dur="5.76">they do not want to be responsible for</text>
  <text start="2472.62" dur="5.64">the collapse of the economy they will</text>
  <text start="2474.93" dur="5.07">they will blame this on someone else so</text>
  <text start="2478.26" dur="3.72">we can see what is happening here they</text>
  <text start="2480" dur="5.01">are in preparation they&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="2481.98" dur="5.28">preparation stage at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2485.01" dur="6.33">getting everything ready just like they</text>
  <text start="2487.26" dur="6.39">did back in August of 2013 in July they</text>
  <text start="2491.34" dur="4.62">said military assets all into Jordan</text>
  <text start="2493.65" dur="4.74">they send soldiers into Jordan for</text>
  <text start="2495.96" dur="4.47">training and after the training was over</text>
  <text start="2498.39" dur="5.1">they just left them there they had the</text>

  <text start="2529.65" dur="7.28">the tapering is going to add mid-2014</text>
  <text start="2533.33" dur="6.01">the elections are happening for Assad in</text>

  <text start="2539.34" dur="4.1">that&amp;#39;s not going to look too good</text>
  <text start="2541.05" dur="5.46">because it shows that people really want</text>
  <text start="2543.44" dur="4.96">Assad as president so we can see how</text>
  <text start="2546.51" dur="4.65">this is turning out so they are doing</text>

  <text start="2719.61" dur="5.49">they DHS has been training for</text>
  <text start="2722.58" dur="5.67">biological and chemical weapon attacks</text>
  <text start="2725.1" dur="5.88">all throughout the country and we can</text>
  <text start="2728.25" dur="6.36">see they&amp;#39;ve been having many many drills</text>
  <text start="2730.98" dur="6.87">training everyone for what is coming so</text>
  <text start="2734.61" dur="7.31">we can see that this is coming down the</text>
  <text start="2737.85" dur="6.54">line and again to prepare us and to</text>
  <text start="2741.92" dur="5.65">convince us that something is coming we</text>
  <text start="2744.39" dur="4.86">are seeing cyber attacks happen all over</text>
  <text start="2747.57" dur="3.42">the place and they&amp;#39;re really ramping</text>
  <text start="2749.25" dur="3.93">this up of course they want to pass some</text>
  <text start="2750.99" dur="4.14">laws yes because they need to take</text>
  <text start="2753.18" dur="4.35">control the internet because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2755.13" dur="4.29">have the new media the alternative media</text>
  <text start="2757.53" dur="3.72">out there telling you what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2759.42" dur="3.93">going on so they&amp;#39;re going to need to</text>
  <text start="2761.25" dur="4.62">take control and they want all</text>
  <text start="2763.35" dur="5.19">information from companies so they can</text>
  <text start="2765.87" dur="4.44">track down and find out who has what and</text>
  <text start="2768.54" dur="4.38">this is why you&amp;#39;re seeing all these</text>
  <text start="2770.31" dur="6.27">cyber attacks and just recently a major</text>
  <text start="2772.92" dur="6.33">cyber security data breach happened and</text>
  <text start="2776.58" dur="4.65">a cyber security firm said on Tuesday</text>
  <text start="2779.25" dur="5.7">that it uncovered stolen credentials</text>
  <text start="2781.23" dur="5.82">from some 360 million accounts that are</text>
  <text start="2784.95" dur="5.16">available for sale on the cyber black</text>
  <text start="2787.05" dur="6.23">market and we have to remember the NSA</text>
  <text start="2790.11" dur="6.3">has back doors to all of these systems</text>
  <text start="2793.28" dur="6.52">one would have to think that they are</text>
  <text start="2796.41" dur="5.64">doing something to show that we are very</text>
  <text start="2799.8" dur="4.62">vulnerable to cyber attacks and we</text>
  <text start="2802.05" dur="4.2">understand we had a cyber attack on the</text>
  <text start="2804.42" dur="3.18">University of Maryland and now there is</text>
  <text start="2806.25" dur="3.3">a cyber attack on the</text>
  <text start="2807.6" dur="5.22">deanna university or a hundred and</text>
  <text start="2809.55" dur="5.16">forty-six thousand students personal</text>
  <text start="2812.82" dur="4.71">data has been stolen they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2814.71" dur="5.64">building this propaganda up about cyber</text>
  <text start="2817.53" dur="5.01">attacks for over two years now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2820.35" dur="4.5">been telling us about power grid they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2822.54" dur="6.57">been we&amp;#39;ve seen dry runs on the power</text>
  <text start="2824.85" dur="8.61">grid they are preparing this is the same</text>
  <text start="2829.11" dur="7.74">exact thing we saw happen in August and</text>
  <text start="2833.46" dur="6.21">this time I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2836.85" dur="4.95">stop because they realize the entire</text>
  <text start="2839.67" dur="5.43">system is collapsing you have to</text>
  <text start="2841.8" dur="5.25">remember back in August of 2013 the Fed</text>
  <text start="2845.1" dur="4.89">was out there saying they were going to</text>
  <text start="2847.05" dur="5.88">begin taper tapering in September and</text>
  <text start="2849.99" dur="6.63">what happened Russia&amp;#39;s stepped in and</text>
  <text start="2852.93" dur="7.44">they couldn&amp;#39;t get Congress and the</text>
  <text start="2856.62" dur="5.79">American people on board to attack Syria</text>
  <text start="2860.37" dur="4.95">because the President cannot just go</text>
  <text start="2862.41" dur="7.26">ahead and attack the only way he can</text>
  <text start="2865.32" dur="7.05">attack is if Syria attacks the United</text>
  <text start="2869.67" dur="6.29">States then all bets are off and again a</text>
  <text start="2872.37" dur="5.49">cyber attack is considered an attack on</text>
  <text start="2875.96" dur="4.87">United States and this is why you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2877.86" dur="5.3">seen in the last two months cyber</text>
  <text start="2880.83" dur="4.8">attacks from the Syrian electronic army</text>
  <text start="2883.16" dur="6.7">which they probably want to exist it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2885.63" dur="6.63">probably the NSA or FBI or CIA but this</text>
  <text start="2889.86" dur="4.17">is what they are promoting and this is</text>
  <text start="2892.26" dur="4.62">what they are doing if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2894.03" dur="5.73">started to prepare I would do it I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2896.88" dur="5.1">believe that this is going to pass like</text>
  <text start="2899.76" dur="6.57">the last time I don&amp;#39;t think Russia is</text>
  <text start="2901.98" dur="7.56">going to step in and say you know you</text>
  <text start="2906.33" dur="5.52">know let us help here if they saw gets</text>
  <text start="2909.54" dur="4.32">rid of his chemical weapons we can all</text>
  <text start="2911.85" dur="4.17">shut this down and we don&amp;#39;t have to do</text>
  <text start="2913.86" dur="5.61">anything they&amp;#39;ve learned their lesson</text>
  <text start="2916.02" dur="5.97">they understand the false flag has to</text>
  <text start="2919.47" dur="5.55">happen here on American soil they</text>
  <text start="2921.99" dur="6.33">understand that it has to happen here to</text>
  <text start="2925.02" dur="7.83">get the American people going and and</text>
  <text start="2928.32" dur="8.67">begging for this attack on Assad or on</text>
  <text start="2932.85" dur="5.49">China or on Russia or on a ramp but most</text>
  <text start="2936.99" dur="2.34">likely it looks like a sign at this</text>
  <text start="2938.34" dur="1.98">point because this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2939.33" dur="3.99">building up for</text>
  <text start="2940.32" dur="4.89">and i would start preparing if you said</text>
  <text start="2943.32" dur="4.29">oh last time I didn&amp;#39;t have to prepare</text>
  <text start="2945.21" dur="4.02">and you stopped I would start I would</text>
  <text start="2947.61" dur="3.54">get batteries because we don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
