  <text start="130.83" dur="4.909">working the economy is responding</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="5.339">exactly like Trump wants it to respond</text>
  <text start="135.739" dur="5.351">think about it by lowering the rates by</text>
  <text start="138.599" dur="4.561">restarting stimulus the economy&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="141.09" dur="4.47">to take off and we&amp;#39;re already starting</text>
  <text start="143.16" dur="5.67">to see this when we look at new home</text>
  <text start="145.56" dur="4.98">sales what do we see happening here well</text>
  <text start="148.83" dur="3.68">in July they collapsed</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="5.76">but since the rates have been dropping</text>
  <text start="152.51" dur="6.88">what happened August new home sales they</text>
  <text start="156.3" dur="4.859">rebounded they rose around seven point</text>
  <text start="159.39" dur="3.98">one percent they all expected them to</text>
  <text start="161.159" dur="5.481">rise by three point eight percent</text>
  <text start="163.37" dur="5.729">but it was 7.1% but they did revise the</text>

  <text start="169.099" dur="4.771">eight percent drop and they revised it</text>
  <text start="170.9" dur="5.85">to eight point six percent but still the</text>
  <text start="173.87" dur="5.97">point is is that the law but by lowering</text>
  <text start="176.75" dur="5.04">the rates and starting stimulus you can</text>
  <text start="179.84" dur="5.25">see that everything is starting to</text>
  <text start="181.79" dur="6.69">rebound now Trump needs this to happen</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="5.459">he is dictating to the Fed what needs to</text>
  <text start="188.48" dur="5.49">happen it used to be where the Fed was</text>
  <text start="190.549" dur="6.121">dictating to the world what was going to</text>
  <text start="193.97" dur="4.59">happen next now that has completely</text>
  <text start="196.67" dur="6.48">changed and we need to remember the</text>
  <text start="198.56" dur="8.009">following this is not to fix the central</text>
  <text start="203.15" dur="5.64">bank economy this is not to kick the can</text>

  <text start="208.79" dur="5.13">able to reset the global economic system</text>
  <text start="211.12" dur="4.66">the purpose of lower rates is to make</text>

  <text start="215.78" dur="4.349">one allow the economy to receive a jolt</text>
  <text start="218.39" dur="4.679">to allow the Patriots to win the</text>

  <text start="223.069" dur="6.781">accomplished more trade deals that</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="6.36">benefit the US will occur Trump will go</text>
  <text start="229.85" dur="6.63">after the Fed Trump will start making</text>
  <text start="232.67" dur="6.81">the case for sound money Trump will say</text>
  <text start="236.48" dur="4.349">we need to audit the Fed now just</text>
  <text start="239.48" dur="3.72">because I listed them like this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="240.829" dur="5.25">mean it&amp;#39;s gonna happen in this order but</text>
  <text start="243.2" dur="5.629">all of these things will happen as we</text>
  <text start="246.079" dur="6.24">come into the into Trump second term why</text>
  <text start="248.829" dur="5.261">because he is free to do what he needs</text>
  <text start="252.319" dur="4.081">to do he doesn&amp;#39;t have to worry about</text>
  <text start="254.09" dur="4.649">reelection he already had the first term</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="5.88">he removed the blocks he already set</text>
  <text start="258.739" dur="7.591">everything up and he&amp;#39;s ready for liftoff</text>
  <text start="262.28" dur="6.87">and he needs to make more trade deals</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="4.23">and this is why China is now extending</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="4.829">an olive branch because they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="270.56" dur="6.479">to realize he&amp;#39;s not going down he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="273.979" dur="5.671">going to be out of the race he will win</text>
  <text start="277.039" dur="5.19">the election and China is starting to</text>
  <text start="279.65" dur="5.55">realize this and China is now extending</text>

  <text start="337.669" dur="6.21">this goes and how everything proceeds</text>
  <text start="339.729" dur="6.611">but we know the main goal for Trump and</text>
  <text start="343.879" dur="4.831">the Patriots is to remove the central</text>
  <text start="346.34" dur="4.77">bank system and this cannot be done by</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="5.1">one country it has to be a coordinated</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="5.07">effort Trump started off by pointing the</text>
  <text start="353.81" dur="3.81">finger at the Fed contradicting them</text>
  <text start="356.18" dur="4.079">telling them that they are worthless</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="4.71">that they&amp;#39;re not benefiting the people</text>
  <text start="360.259" dur="4.921">that they have no idea what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.33" dur="5.639">doing they&amp;#39;re not helping the economy we</text>
  <text start="365.18" dur="4.859">will soon see others and when I say</text>
  <text start="367.969" dur="5.341">others I&amp;#39;m talking about other countries</text>

  <text start="414.319" dur="4.681">and they did everything completely</text>
  <text start="416.779" dur="6.721">opposite of what the central bank system</text>
  <text start="419" dur="8.22">wants a country to do and the CEO of</text>

  <text start="440.21" dur="5.46">international organizations like the IMF</text>
  <text start="442.34" dur="5.4">they must die I think that the IMF is</text>
  <text start="445.67" dur="4.92">absolutely dead he said that the</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="4.92">International watchdog is incapable of</text>
  <text start="450.59" dur="4.08">meeting the need to reform something</text>
  <text start="452.66" dur="4.11">which has been discussed for many years</text>
  <text start="454.67" dur="5.01">other international organizations should</text>
  <text start="456.77" dur="4.56">not be independent on the IMF as it only</text>
  <text start="459.68" dur="4.68">offers old-fashioned ways to solve</text>
  <text start="461.33" dur="6.74">problems now we need to remember that</text>

  <text start="500.93" dur="4.91">follow the recommendations on taxes and</text>
  <text start="503.39" dur="5.79">wait you know what they did instead of</text>
  <text start="505.84" dur="5.17">pushing austerity on the people like the</text>
  <text start="509.18" dur="3.98">central bankers like you to do because</text>
  <text start="511.01" dur="4.8">they want you to take on more debt</text>
  <text start="513.16" dur="4.6">that&amp;#39;s why they do this they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>

  <text start="529.64" dur="5.55">going to pay off their debts and in 2005</text>
  <text start="532.73" dur="6.45">Russia managed to repay the loans to the</text>

  <text start="562.85" dur="5.4">doing it your way they don&amp;#39;t like this</text>
  <text start="565.91" dur="6.39">because they&amp;#39;re exposed think about it</text>
  <text start="568.25" dur="6.48">they didn&amp;#39;t listen to the IMF and now</text>
  <text start="572.3" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re better off look at those</text>

  <text start="582.95" dur="6.75">yes it might seem like it but look at</text>
  <text start="586.37" dur="6.99">their debt look at all the austerity</text>
  <text start="589.7" dur="5.67">they had to implement this is the big</text>
  <text start="593.36" dur="4.979">difference and this is what they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="595.37" dur="6.18">want the world to see this is their</text>
  <text start="598.339" dur="5.481">kryptonite a country that takes over the</text>
  <text start="601.55" dur="6.12">private western central bank pays off</text>
  <text start="603.82" dur="8.2">their entire debt and no longer listens</text>
  <text start="607.67" dur="9.15">or no longer takes orders from a central</text>
  <text start="612.02" dur="7.46">bank and we can see already the shot</text>
  <text start="616.82" dur="6.3">across the bow was just fired</text>
  <text start="619.48" dur="7.03">we have Russia saying you know something</text>

  <text start="629.63" dur="8.37">is clueless they have no idea what to do</text>
  <text start="633.11" dur="7.14">and this is why you can see as Trump</text>
  <text start="638" dur="7.17">continually cuts rates and brings them</text>
  <text start="640.25" dur="7.77">to zero what happens the central bank</text>
  <text start="645.17" dur="5.94">system starts to lose control when rates</text>
  <text start="648.02" dur="6.84">go to negative what happens the central</text>
  <text start="651.11" dur="4.95">bank loses more control and then as they</text>
  <text start="654.86" dur="3.9">lose control</text>
  <text start="656.06" dur="7.23">what can the leaders of each of these</text>
  <text start="658.76" dur="6.6">countries do they can say hey look look</text>
