  <text start="137.79" dur="4.62">us that everything is fine and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="140.52" dur="4.46">do this to the bitter end they will</text>
  <text start="142.41" dur="5.07">never admit it until everything is</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="4.27">completely collapsed but again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.48" dur="2.7">not going to take blame for this because</text>
  <text start="149.25" dur="2.58">they&amp;#39;re going to blame this on another</text>
  <text start="150.18" dur="3.36">country or another group and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="151.83" dur="3.69">already started that process with China</text>

  <text start="158.43" dur="4.98">blame it on two countries or a country</text>
  <text start="162.03" dur="2.24">in a group it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter at</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="4.45">this point</text>
  <text start="164.27" dur="6.93">we see Australia right now of course</text>
  <text start="167.86" dur="7.06">their media is saying that their retail</text>
  <text start="171.2" dur="6.78">sales have unexpectedly fallen and they</text>
  <text start="174.92" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t know why well we know why because</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="7.26">the economies of the private central</text>
  <text start="179.9" dur="7.8">bank world is not working anymore I mean</text>
  <text start="185.24" dur="6.66">if you really look at all of these</text>
  <text start="187.7" dur="8.28">countries were all interconnected each</text>
  <text start="191.9" dur="8.61">country right now is just swamp with</text>
  <text start="195.98" dur="8.49">debt and interest rates are very very</text>
  <text start="200.51" dur="10.7">low I mean Australian retail sales fell</text>
  <text start="204.47" dur="9.81">in july by 0.1% and we see in canada</text>
  <text start="211.21" dur="5.76">where the corporate media they&amp;#39;re kinda</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="6.57">admitted that they&amp;#39;re in a recession and</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="7.15">this is starting because just a couple</text>
  <text start="220.85" dur="4.77">of months ago or even a year ago they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.12" dur="3.78">saying that they were in a housing boom</text>
  <text start="225.62" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s incredible it&amp;#39;s not a bubble this</text>
  <text start="227.9" dur="6.03">is fantastic we see growth we see</text>
  <text start="231.41" dur="6.75">fantastic things happening and how</text>
  <text start="233.93" dur="8.46">quickly that changes Mario Draghi was</text>
  <text start="238.16" dur="9.71">out there and he is saying that he now</text>
  <text start="242.39" dur="7.47">has the ability to raise qe2</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="6.93">thirty-three percent from twenty five</text>
  <text start="249.86" dur="8.73">percent he also is cutting the euro area</text>
  <text start="254.8" dur="5.68">inflation forecast for 2015 he says</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="6.15">there are now downside risks to growth</text>
  <text start="260.48" dur="7.97">and inflation his data also shows him</text>
  <text start="264.74" dur="10.26">that there&amp;#39;s the economies are growing</text>
  <text start="268.45" dur="10.36">slower and the recovery is somewhat</text>
  <text start="275" dur="7.2">weaker at this point but don&amp;#39;t worry the</text>
  <text start="278.81" dur="5.82">ECB can adjust size duration of the QE</text>
  <text start="282.2" dur="4.26">if needed basically what he&amp;#39;s saying is</text>
  <text start="284.63" dur="5.22">hey if we have to create or print money</text>
  <text start="286.46" dur="6.269">we can do it we can prop up these bangs</text>
  <text start="289.85" dur="4.62">we can prop up the markets but the</text>
  <text start="292.729" dur="3.831">economies are going to continually fall</text>
  <text start="294.47" dur="3.33">there so they&amp;#39;re not going to get better</text>
  <text start="296.56" dur="2.44">they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="3.299">give us the illusion that it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="299" dur="3.81">better but what they&amp;#39;re saying right now</text>
  <text start="301.099" dur="4.621">is they understand that this whole</text>
  <text start="302.81" dur="5.06">things falling apart but they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="305.72" dur="5.909">to come out and say it they never will</text>
  <text start="307.87" dur="5.65">we see here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="311.629" dur="5.581">initial jobless claims have risen for</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="8.88">five of the of the last six weeks we had</text>

  <text start="331.4" dur="4.859">number down you have to remember the US</text>
  <text start="333.62" dur="5.669">government back in 2013 got rid of their</text>
  <text start="336.259" dur="6.15">department that counts layoffs but we do</text>
  <text start="339.289" dur="5.34">have private companies that look into</text>
  <text start="342.409" dur="7.98">this and one of them is Challenger Gray</text>
  <text start="344.629" dur="12.901">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that 2015</text>

  <text start="645.16" dur="6.52">something bad is coming mark farmers out</text>
  <text start="649.31" dur="4.529">there and he&amp;#39;s saying I think that</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="4.35">because of modern central banking and</text>
  <text start="653.839" dur="5.341">repeated interventions with the monetary</text>
  <text start="656.03" dur="5.55">policy in other words QE all around the</text>

  <text start="671.93" dur="5.58">what it will happen next in terms of</text>
  <text start="674.03" dur="7.559">purchasing power of money what we know</text>
  <text start="677.51" dur="7.65">is that it&amp;#39;s going down I would rather</text>
  <text start="681.589" dur="9.241">focus on precious metals gold silver put</text>

  <text start="703.37" dur="5.52">a government official comes out and says</text>
  <text start="705.62" dur="6.36">something always think the opposite and</text>
  <text start="708.89" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;ll be okay I mean think about what</text>
  <text start="711.98" dur="4.41">Ben Bernanke told us back in two</text>
  <text start="713.42" dur="6">thousand eight he&amp;#39;s not forecasting any</text>
  <text start="716.39" dur="4.8">type of recession in the year we had the</text>
  <text start="719.42" dur="3.63">stock market crash which started the</text>
  <text start="721.19" dur="4.47">recession which really didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="4.65">start this recession the market was the</text>
  <text start="725.66" dur="5.28">last indicator that this economy was</text>
  <text start="727.7" dur="7.46">already falling apart so what has</text>
  <text start="730.94" dur="6.6">happened the central bankers right now</text>
  <text start="735.16" dur="4.54">they did all these stress tests in the</text>
  <text start="737.54" dur="4.41">banking system and they did this on</text>
  <text start="739.7" dur="3.78">purpose because back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="741.95" dur="2.7">eight people were very wary about</text>
  <text start="743.48" dur="3.6">putting their money in there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="744.65" dur="4.35">nervous about the bank system and they</text>
  <text start="747.08" dur="7.38">did this to boost investor and public</text>
  <text start="749" dur="8.64">confidence but we know this was all a</text>
  <text start="754.46" dur="6.21">bunch of propaganda we know they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="757.64" dur="6.51">really doing stress tests we know that</text>
  <text start="760.67" dur="4.92">this had no significance on what was</text>
  <text start="764.15" dur="5.07">really going on because if you really</text>
  <text start="765.59" dur="5.64">look like the dexia bank the bank iya</text>
  <text start="769.22" dur="3.36">and all the Greek banks while they were</text>
  <text start="771.23" dur="4.02">doing all these stress tests they all</text>
  <text start="772.58" dur="5.88">failed during this period and guess what</text>
