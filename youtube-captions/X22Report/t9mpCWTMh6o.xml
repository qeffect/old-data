  <text start="211.58" dur="5.26">would flourish after the initial shock</text>
  <text start="214.26" dur="5.85">of No Deal he said that the only way to</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="5.85">deliver brexit is to go back to the</text>

  <text start="297.8" dur="6.829">there they don&amp;#39;t care what the people</text>
  <text start="299.479" dur="8.851">say they only care about following the</text>
  <text start="304.629" dur="6.97">instructions of the central bank this is</text>

  <text start="318.129" dur="6.13">hopefully he follows through hopefully</text>
  <text start="321.139" dur="6.391">they win the elections hopefully they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.259" dur="5.491">calling the shots but remember the EU</text>
  <text start="327.53" dur="5.22">the central banking system they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.75" dur="5.4">always going to try to fight back no</text>
  <text start="332.75" dur="5.06">matter what until the very end remember</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="5.46">they have a lot on the line right now</text>
  <text start="337.81" dur="5.02">because once the UK and I do believe</text>
  <text start="340.61" dur="5.61">this is going to happen once they vote</text>
  <text start="342.83" dur="7.95">themselves away and they do it with a No</text>
  <text start="346.22" dur="7.47">Deal and the UK does very very well and</text>
  <text start="350.78" dur="5.18">the economy flourishes and countries</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="5.729">decide to make trade deals with them</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="6.22">well the EU is gonna look pretty darn</text>
  <text start="359.419" dur="5.131">bad and other countries like Hungary and</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="4.95">Italy and the rest they&amp;#39;re gonna say why</text>
  <text start="364.55" dur="5.64">are we even part of the EU look what</text>
  <text start="367.13" dur="4.98">happened to the UK this is their worst</text>
  <text start="370.19" dur="6.33">nightmare and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="372.11" dur="8.16">fighting so hard to keep the UK in the</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="6.269">EU they don&amp;#39;t want anyone to find out</text>
  <text start="380.27" dur="6.889">they don&amp;#39;t want anyone to realize what</text>
  <text start="382.789" dur="7.68">the truth is the truth is their enemy</text>
  <text start="387.159" dur="6.13">now here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="390.469" dur="4.831">central bank system and we know that</text>
  <text start="393.289" dur="3.81">there are two things happening here we</text>
  <text start="395.3" dur="4.2">have the central bank system which is</text>
  <text start="397.099" dur="4.801">completely collapsing it cannot be</text>
  <text start="399.5" dur="3.96">sustained we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this for</text>
  <text start="401.9" dur="4.199">quite a while this is not a surprise</text>
  <text start="403.46" dur="4.859">that housing their prices are starting</text>
  <text start="406.099" dur="4.47">to fall that the housing market is</text>
  <text start="408.319" dur="5.311">imploding remember what they stopped</text>
  <text start="410.569" dur="5.13">they stopped stimulus guess what else</text>
  <text start="413.63" dur="4.23">the Federal Reserve did they raised</text>
  <text start="415.699" dur="4.83">rates remember the only reason</text>
  <text start="417.86" dur="4.47">everything was being pushed up in this</text>
  <text start="420.529" dur="4.681">bubble was because they were pushing</text>
  <text start="422.33" dur="5.25">stimulus and they were keeping the rates</text>
  <text start="425.21" dur="5.28">steady or lowering the rates when they</text>
  <text start="427.58" dur="3.859">did the opposite what happened this is</text>
  <text start="430.49" dur="2.81">why we file</text>
  <text start="431.439" dur="3.75">all of this so this wouldn&amp;#39;t be a</text>
  <text start="433.3" dur="4.229">surprise to everyone now when we look at</text>
  <text start="435.189" dur="4.32">Case Shiller we know they took 20 cities</text>
  <text start="437.529" dur="3.9">and they said okay we could take these</text>
  <text start="439.509" dur="4.08">20 cities and we can blow up bubbles</text>
  <text start="441.429" dur="2.73">they told investment companies hedge</text>
  <text start="443.589" dur="2.93">funds</text>
  <text start="444.159" dur="4.68">listen buy as many houses as possible</text>
  <text start="446.519" dur="4.48">don&amp;#39;t sell them keep them off the market</text>
  <text start="448.839" dur="5.521">we&amp;#39;re gonna drive the prices up this is</text>
  <text start="450.999" dur="5.43">exactly what they did now since they</text>
  <text start="454.36" dur="3.75">were raising rates and they were</text>
  <text start="456.429" dur="3.6">tightening because they had a completely</text>
  <text start="458.11" dur="2.699">different plan everything started to</text>
  <text start="460.029" dur="3.87">fall apart</text>
  <text start="460.809" dur="4.97">housing prices started to come down I</text>
  <text start="463.899" dur="5.55">mean if we look at the 20-city composite</text>
  <text start="465.779" dur="7.18">we see that prices have fallen they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="469.449" dur="4.08">no longer moving up what his Trump have</text>
  <text start="472.959" dur="3.78">to do</text>
  <text start="473.529" dur="5.4">he needs the Federal Reserve to start</text>
  <text start="476.739" dur="5.61">stimulus again he needs the Federal</text>
  <text start="478.929" dur="6.27">Reserve to lower rates now is this going</text>
  <text start="482.349" dur="6.09">to be done to keep the economy the way</text>
  <text start="485.199" dur="5.64">it is yes long enough so he can win the</text>
  <text start="488.439" dur="4.14">2020 elections because he needs to</text>
  <text start="490.839" dur="5.64">follow through on the rest of the plan</text>
  <text start="492.579" dur="7.08">this wasn&amp;#39;t a four-year plan it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="496.479" dur="5.25">going to happen in four years remember</text>
  <text start="499.659" dur="4.831">what the deep state what the central</text>
  <text start="501.729" dur="4.59">banks have been doing they were trying</text>
  <text start="504.49" dur="4.62">to get him out of office he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="506.319" dur="4.32">fighting that what else were they trying</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="3.479">to do they were truck they were going to</text>
  <text start="510.639" dur="3.601">bring down the economy so he would never</text>
  <text start="512.589" dur="6.75">get another four-year term</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="8.339">well he&amp;#39;s changed all that and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="519.339" dur="7.471">following the plan and they need to get</text>
  <text start="522.579" dur="6.81">everything aligned why because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="4.379">second half of this plan is to bring</text>
  <text start="529.389" dur="3.991">down the central bank and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="531.189" dur="4.14">to need four years to do this</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="3.959">does this mean is gonna start you know</text>
  <text start="535.329" dur="4.801">day one when he wins the election know</text>
  <text start="537.339" dur="4.261">it might start in the first year or the</text>
  <text start="540.13" dur="5.04">second year but they&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="7.56">this time period and Trump right now</text>
  <text start="545.17" dur="5.609">he is controlling the narrative right</text>
  <text start="549.16" dur="4.099">now Americans haven&amp;#39;t been this</text>
  <text start="550.779" dur="7.11">confident in the current economy since</text>
  <text start="553.259" dur="7.121">2000 and he is using this to his benefit</text>
  <text start="557.889" dur="4.591">I mean think about it the mainstream</text>
  <text start="560.38" dur="4.56">media the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="562.48" dur="5.34">the financial punnets the roll</text>
  <text start="564.94" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re saying that listen the economy</text>
  <text start="567.82" dur="4.89">is gonna go into a recession in 2020 I</text>
  <text start="570.52" dur="3.96">mean they knew exactly when where what</text>
  <text start="572.71" dur="3.93">and how and everything else they knew</text>
  <text start="574.48" dur="4.2">exactly what was going to go on because</text>
  <text start="576.64" dur="3.21">they had this plan they thought the</text>
  <text start="578.68" dur="2.94">Federal Reserve was gonna continually</text>
  <text start="579.85" dur="3.42">raise rates and the economy was going to</text>
  <text start="581.62" dur="4.89">go down that was the information they</text>
  <text start="583.27" dur="5.57">were being fed and now what we find out</text>
  <text start="586.51" dur="5.19">is that the opposite is happening and</text>
  <text start="588.84" dur="4.92">now the mainstream media because the</text>
  <text start="591.7" dur="5.49">economy is doing so well statistically</text>
  <text start="593.76" dur="6.07">statistically and remember these</text>
  <text start="597.19" dur="5.34">statistics this is the weapon they used</text>
  <text start="599.83" dur="4.11">against the people when they wanted to</text>
  <text start="602.53" dur="2.85">show the economy was doing well they</text>
  <text start="603.94" dur="3.09">said look at the stock market look at</text>
  <text start="605.38" dur="4.89">unemployment numbers because it&amp;#39;s easy</text>
  <text start="607.03" dur="6.39">to manipulate these numbers now we see</text>
  <text start="610.27" dur="7.05">that CB s well they can&amp;#39;t skew the poll</text>
  <text start="613.42" dur="9.18">numbers anymore against Trump so they</text>
  <text start="617.32" dur="9.66">have to admit that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="622.6" dur="6.99">a lot better now according to a CBS News</text>
  <text start="626.98" dur="5.73">poll seven in ten Americans believe the</text>

  <text start="994.37" dur="5.43">need a lot more of those dollars to pay</text>
  <text start="996.949" dur="5.88">for the same exact thing if we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="999.8" dur="6.12">creating all this currency and we peg it</text>
