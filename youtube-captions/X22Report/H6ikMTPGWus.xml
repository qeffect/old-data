  <text start="89.75" dur="4.35">too much debt and we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="91.28" dur="5.1">this many times before and of course the</text>

  <text start="96.38" dur="6.239">Greece more and more debt and as we can</text>
  <text start="99.2" dur="5.279">see since 2008 that this does not work</text>

  <text start="137.89" dur="3.25">they&amp;#39;re getting very nervous at this</text>
  <text start="140.09" dur="3.39">point because they&amp;#39;re reaching that</text>
  <text start="141.14" dur="3.93">tipping point we see things in Greece</text>
  <text start="143.48" dur="2.88">are getting a lot worse even though they</text>
  <text start="145.07" dur="3.3">can try to convince us that everything</text>
  <text start="146.36" dur="4.56">is getting a lot better we see the</text>
  <text start="148.37" dur="6.09">opposite occurring now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="150.92" dur="5.79">right now is Greece and many other</text>
  <text start="154.46" dur="4.44">countries across Europe they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="156.71" dur="4.32">on more and more debt unemployment is</text>
  <text start="158.9" dur="3.75">continually rising I know throughout the</text>
  <text start="161.03" dur="3.4">eurozone they&amp;#39;re saying look how great</text>
  <text start="162.65" dur="3.789">it is unemployment</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="5.58">drop by like point one percent it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="170.01" dur="6.209">bouncing around at the same level for</text>
  <text start="173.159" dur="6.511">quite a while and we know that they use</text>
  <text start="176.219" dur="5.52">statistical manipulation we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="5.549">doing the same thing as the u.s. now I</text>
  <text start="181.739" dur="5.131">mean even out in the UK they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="185.219" dur="3.6">to convince us that the reason that</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="6.72">retail sales have been dropping it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.819" dur="7.98">because the weather is the blame easter</text>

  <text start="196.799" dur="4.56">bright as it normally is nonetheless one</text>
  <text start="199.379" dur="5.341">I made up but what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="201.359" dur="6.481">they&amp;#39;re continually making excuses of</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="5.37">why the economy why retail sales aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="5.67">doing well and the British Retail</text>

  <text start="213.51" dur="5.309">by point seven percent in march compared</text>
  <text start="216.78" dur="5.03">to a year earlier now what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="218.819" dur="6.48">right now is the global economy is</text>
  <text start="221.81" dur="5.53">slowing its declining and we talked</text>
  <text start="225.299" dur="4.5">about this quite a bit here in the</text>
  <text start="227.34" dur="5.209">United States we see many different</text>
  <text start="229.799" dur="5.791">signs that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="232.549" dur="5.41">deteriorating now one of the things is</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="5.609">is that the number of homeless students</text>
  <text start="237.959" dur="7.351">is steadily rising in this country it is</text>
  <text start="241.199" dur="5.731">up thirty-eight percent since 2009 2010</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="5.37">now that is during the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="5.429">and moving forward we were supposed to</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="3.449">be in this incredible recovery where</text>
  <text start="252.359" dur="3.511">people were getting jobs people were</text>
  <text start="254.129" dur="5.211">making money they&amp;#39;re telling us people</text>
  <text start="255.87" dur="6.69">are purchasing homes but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="7.03">homeless students in our school systems</text>
  <text start="262.56" dur="6.9">rise and the u.s. education department</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="4.41">says 1.3 million homeless students were</text>
  <text start="269.46" dur="3.989">enrolled in the nation&amp;#39;s public schools</text>
  <text start="270.78" dur="5.879">in the year 2013 to 2014 this is the</text>
  <text start="273.449" dur="5.041">most recent data and this is an increase</text>
  <text start="276.659" dur="5.85">of about six point six seven percent</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="7.83">since 2012-2013 and the projected</text>
  <text start="282.509" dur="5.821">numbers for 2015 2016 is much higher and</text>
  <text start="286.32" dur="6.599">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of the problems are</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="7.25">that parents who once had a nice paying</text>
  <text start="292.919" dur="5.101">job lost their jobs they can&amp;#39;t find jobs</text>
  <text start="295.58" dur="5.53">some took on part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="298.02" dur="6.269">and they can&amp;#39;t make ends meet and this</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="5.39">is continually happening throughout this</text>
  <text start="304.289" dur="5.97">country&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a</text>
  <text start="306.5" dur="7.81">systematic destruction of the American</text>
  <text start="310.259" dur="6.63">Way of life for families and when we</text>
  <text start="314.31" dur="5.009">look at all the signs we see it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="316.889" dur="5.221">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="319.319" dur="5.75">a lot of the good jobs are completely</text>
  <text start="322.11" dur="5.7">gone people are taking on part-time work</text>
  <text start="325.069" dur="5.171">we&amp;#39;re seeing that the the poorest forty</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="5.13">percent of all Americans now spend more</text>
  <text start="330.24" dur="5.94">than fifty percent of their incomes on</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="6.89">food and housing because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="336.18" dur="5.88">anything extra that&amp;#39;s all they have and</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="4.209">for those Americans that don&amp;#39;t own a</text>
  <text start="342.06" dur="4.38">home fifty percent of them spend more</text>
  <text start="344.039" dur="6.06">than a third of their incomes just on</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="7.02">rent the price of school lunches has</text>
  <text start="350.099" dur="4.671">risen to three dollars mark at many of</text>
  <text start="353.46" dur="4.35">the public schools across the nation</text>
  <text start="354.77" dur="5.019">McDonald&amp;#39;s their dollar menu well now</text>
  <text start="357.81" dur="4.71">includes a lot of items that have</text>

  <text start="369.63" dur="6">home less than 30,000 a year in wages</text>
  <text start="372.78" dur="4.77">and if we look at the article from the</text>
  <text start="375.63" dur="4.23">New York Times they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="377.55" dur="5.28">typical American household is now worth</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="5.85">thirty-six percent less than it was a</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="5.489">decade ago sixty-two percent of all</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="5.579">Americans they are living paycheck to</text>
  <text start="388.319" dur="5.731">paycheck right now and as we know the</text>
  <text start="391.289" dur="5.28">rate of home ownership has declined for</text>
  <text start="394.05" dur="8.729">seven years in a row and it is now the</text>
  <text start="396.569" dur="7.801">lowest that has been in 20 years for</text>
  <text start="402.779" dur="4.29">each of the past six years more</text>
  <text start="404.37" dur="6.09">businesses have closed here in the</text>
  <text start="407.069" dur="9.84">United States and have opened prior to</text>
  <text start="410.46" dur="9.959">2008 we&amp;#39;ve never seen this before we see</text>
  <text start="416.909" dur="5.57">the debt in the US has reached 1</text>
  <text start="420.419" dur="5.521">trillion dollars and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="422.479" dur="8.601">credit card debt and this is according</text>
  <text start="425.94" dur="8.439">to data from card hub now why are we</text>
  <text start="431.08" dur="6.089">seeing credit card debt continually</text>
  <text start="434.379" dur="6.5">moving up and up and up because we know</text>
  <text start="437.169" dur="5.941">what happens when people lose their jobs</text>
  <text start="440.879" dur="6.91">when people do not have the income</text>
  <text start="443.11" dur="6.649">coming in when people have bills because</text>
  <text start="447.789" dur="5.1">they were set in a different way of life</text>
  <text start="449.759" dur="7.12">they try to continually live that way of</text>
  <text start="452.889" dur="6.361">life and they use credit cards they use</text>
  <text start="456.879" dur="3.961">it to purchase things to purchase food</text>
  <text start="459.25" dur="3.96">those people who have lost their jobs</text>
  <text start="460.84" dur="4.949">sometimes credit cards is the only way</text>
  <text start="463.21" dur="7.65">they have the ability to pay for food or</text>
  <text start="465.789" dur="8.761">pay for rent or anything else so what</text>
  <text start="470.86" dur="5.94">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="474.55" dur="3.95">economy each one of these economic</text>
  <text start="476.8" dur="4.26">indicators that we continually point out</text>
  <text start="478.5" dur="4.779">alone they don&amp;#39;t look like anything you</text>
  <text start="481.06" dur="3.87">know all right you know so we see that</text>
  <text start="483.279" dur="4.19">manufacturing is declined a little bit</text>
  <text start="484.93" dur="5.789">but when you put them all together</text>
  <text start="487.469" dur="7.57">they&amp;#39;re creating this perfect storm for</text>
  <text start="490.719" dur="7.741">this economic collapse and we see more</text>
  <text start="495.039" dur="6.18">and more indicators that are flashing</text>
  <text start="498.46" dur="5.489">red right in front of our faces if we</text>
  <text start="501.219" dur="7.23">look at the auto market use car prices</text>
  <text start="503.949" dur="6.21">they are declining right now now you say</text>
  <text start="508.449" dur="4.89">uh who cares used car prices they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.159" dur="6.93">coming down that means nothing but when</text>
  <text start="513.339" dur="8.82">we look at this this looks exactly like</text>
  <text start="517.089" dur="9.301">2008 we&amp;#39;re used car prices were plunging</text>
  <text start="522.159" dur="8.311">at that time and we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="6.96">same pace and what this means is is that</text>
  <text start="530.47" dur="4.41">if used car prices are declining and</text>
  <text start="533.35" dur="4.849">people go to trade in their cars to get</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="5.37">a new car they&amp;#39;re not getting as much</text>
  <text start="538.199" dur="3.371">which makes it a little bit more</text>
  <text start="540.25" dur="3.69">difficult to get that car because your</text>
  <text start="541.57" dur="4.949">payments are a little bit higher and if</text>
  <text start="543.94" dur="4.94">we look at the US auto sales via ward&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="546.519" dur="5.121">automotive group they&amp;#39;ve tumbled</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="6.69">three-point-five percent year-on-year</text>
  <text start="551.64" dur="8.17">this is the biggest plunge since july of</text>
  <text start="555.57" dur="5.259">2009 so when we look at this right now</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="3.36">we start putting all these pieces</text>
  <text start="560.829" dur="3.19">together we start to see this bigger</text>
  <text start="563.17" dur="4.269">picture</text>
  <text start="564.019" dur="6.031">and if we go back in time and we look at</text>
  <text start="567.439" dur="5.851">all of this this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="570.05" dur="5.729">complete disaster now yesterday we</text>

  <text start="641.299" dur="5.191">starting to see things really ramped up</text>
  <text start="643.04" dur="5.789">here and if we look at us import prices</text>
  <text start="646.49" dur="6.87">for the 20 month in a row we see that</text>

  <text start="708.35" dur="6.71">stocks now we see hedge funds they have</text>
  <text start="712.16" dur="6.92">been net sellers for four weeks now</text>
  <text start="715.06" dur="6.64">institutional investors have been</text>
  <text start="719.08" dur="6.85">selling for four weeks now private</text>
  <text start="721.7" dur="7.41">clients they&amp;#39;ve been selling and what</text>
  <text start="725.93" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="729.11" dur="3.63">get out of the market right now because</text>
  <text start="730.34" dur="5.42">they know what&amp;#39;s happening and we see</text>
  <text start="732.74" dur="8.37">that GDP like we discussed before has</text>
  <text start="735.76" dur="6.79">been recalculated 2.1 percent now it</text>
  <text start="741.11" dur="2.94">will probably go down a little bit even</text>
  <text start="742.55" dur="3.06">further than that but we know what the</text>
  <text start="744.05" dur="3.72">US government central bankers are going</text>
  <text start="745.61" dur="6.63">to do they&amp;#39;re going to throw in whatever</text>
  <text start="747.77" dur="5.88">they have to to keep GDP up but it might</text>
  <text start="752.24" dur="3.63">have gotten so bad that they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="753.65" dur="3.99">the ability to do this at this point but</text>
  <text start="755.87" dur="6.63">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about GDP is</text>
  <text start="757.64" dur="6.99">that for the sixth year running they</text>
  <text start="762.5" dur="7.35">have been wrong and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="764.63" dur="7.08">GDP to climb in six years where they</text>
  <text start="769.85" dur="4.05">keep telling us that don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="771.71" dur="3.57">it GDP is going to be three percent</text>
  <text start="773.9" dur="5.15">don&amp;#39;t worry about it GTP is going to be</text>
  <text start="775.28" dur="7.5">2.5% we are seeing GDP continually</text>
  <text start="779.05" dur="8.68">decline over these last six years and</text>
  <text start="782.78" dur="9.18">here we are in 2016 at point one percent</text>
  <text start="787.73" dur="6.42">this is the forecast right now we see</text>
  <text start="791.96" dur="6.96">the EU Parliament chief is warning that</text>
  <text start="794.15" dur="7.52">the EU might implode on itself people</text>
  <text start="798.92" dur="7.71">have lost trust in the entire</text>
  <text start="801.67" dur="8.86">institution and there are major problems</text>
  <text start="806.63" dur="6.06">coming the IMF right now they&amp;#39;ve come</text>
  <text start="810.53" dur="5.55">out with their warning they have cut</text>
  <text start="812.69" dur="6.24">global growth forecasts again warns of</text>
  <text start="816.08" dur="6.3">secular stagnation so what does that</text>
  <text start="818.93" dur="6.72">mean that means everything they</text>
  <text start="822.38" dur="4.89">predicted back in 2014 2015 telling us</text>
  <text start="825.65" dur="5.52">that the economies of the world we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="827.27" dur="6.569">going to take off they&amp;#39;re wrong again</text>
  <text start="831.17" dur="7.409">they cut their forecast for 2016 from</text>
  <text start="833.839" dur="6.961">3.4 down to 3.2 and for 2017 already</text>
  <text start="838.579" dur="4.051">they&amp;#39;re saying instead of 3.6 it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="840.8" dur="3.9">to be 3.5 and we know these numbers are</text>
  <text start="842.63" dur="5.16">going to be much much lower remember if</text>
  <text start="844.7" dur="8.189">we go back to July of 2014 the IMF was</text>
  <text start="847.79" dur="7.08">forecasting four percent for 2016 it is</text>
  <text start="852.889" dur="3.241">now twenty percent lower and we know</text>
  <text start="854.87" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s going to go much much lower than</text>
  <text start="856.13" dur="3.54">that because whenever they do this they</text>
  <text start="857.87" dur="3.6">keep lowering it and lowering it</text>
  <text start="859.67" dur="5.539">throughout the year and then we hit that</text>
  <text start="861.47" dur="7.559">mark you know 1.5% one point two percent</text>
  <text start="865.209" dur="6.461">around that area so what does this mean</text>
  <text start="869.029" dur="3.961">this means as everything continually</text>
  <text start="871.67" dur="3.779">declines and everything continually</text>
  <text start="872.99" dur="4.529">slows what are we going to see the</text>
  <text start="875.449" dur="5.671">central banks do most likely we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="877.519" dur="5.971">to see QE zerp nerp and so on they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="881.12" dur="4.23">going to pull all the different tricks</text>
  <text start="883.49" dur="4.529">out of their bag to try to keep this</text>
  <text start="885.35" dur="6.95">system alive and this is something that</text>
  <text start="888.019" dur="7.981">we need to look at because as we can see</text>
  <text start="892.3" dur="5.86">Obama Janet Yellen had a closed-door</text>
  <text start="896" dur="3.87">meeting again they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="898.16" dur="3.75">closed-door meeting of the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="899.87" dur="4.25">doing well they call a meeting when</text>
  <text start="901.91" dur="5.64">things are bad when things are messed up</text>
  <text start="904.12" dur="5.409">that&amp;#39;s why they called this meeting yes</text>
  <text start="907.55" dur="3.479">they came out with ridiculous statements</text>
  <text start="909.529" dur="3.42">about how they&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="911.029" dur="4.021">economy and this what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="912.949" dur="4.441">about is how everything is rapidly</text>
  <text start="915.05" dur="4.289">falling apart how do we keep the</text>
  <text start="917.39" dur="3.6">illusion of life how do we fool the</text>
  <text start="919.339" dur="5.071">American people and the world that</text>
  <text start="920.99" dur="6.57">everything is fine because as everything</text>
  <text start="924.41" dur="5.25">continually falls apart the illusion</text>
  <text start="927.56" dur="4.139">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense anymore and they</text>
  <text start="929.66" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t want a Black Swan type of scenario</text>
  <text start="931.699" dur="6.811">they want to bring down this economy on</text>
  <text start="933.89" dur="6.9">their own terms and this is what</text>
  <text start="938.51" dur="6.03">probably most likely is the discussion</text>
  <text start="940.79" dur="5.489">they were having because if we&amp;#39;re truly</text>
  <text start="944.54" dur="5.729">in a recovery and everything was doing</text>
  <text start="946.279" dur="6.18">well everyone knows it everyone feels it</text>
  <text start="950.269" dur="5.281">there&amp;#39;s no reason to continually repeat</text>
  <text start="952.459" dur="5.13">it because everyone has jobs everyone</text>
  <text start="955.55" dur="4.32">has extra money everyone&amp;#39;s purchasing in</text>
  <text start="957.589" dur="4.891">retail that means stores are expanding</text>
  <text start="959.87" dur="4.709">that means factories are producing that</text>
  <text start="962.48" dur="4.769">means GDP is continually go</text>
  <text start="964.579" dur="3.99">going up that means all of these</text>
  <text start="967.249" dur="4.38">economic indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="968.569" dur="5.61">looking at would be rising but we see</text>
  <text start="971.629" dur="5.94">everything declining that tells us</text>
  <text start="974.179" dur="6.03">something that tells us we&amp;#39;re at the end</text>
  <text start="977.569" dur="5.07">here listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="980.209" dur="6.021">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
