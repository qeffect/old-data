  <text start="118.69" dur="4.65">Congressional Budget Office and if you</text>

  <text start="123.34" dur="4.91">throw this organization in everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="125.56" dur="5.43">face saying well with Obamacare if</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="4.56">Obamacare is repealed 32 million people</text>
  <text start="130.99" dur="4.469">are going to lose their insurance and</text>
  <text start="132.81" dur="4.539">during each of these processes this is</text>
  <text start="135.459" dur="3.931">what we hear even with the budget and</text>
  <text start="137.349" dur="4.081">everything else they make all different</text>
  <text start="139.39" dur="4.2">types of forecasts now when we start to</text>
  <text start="141.43" dur="5.94">look at their track record of forecasts</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="6.6">we see that things aren&amp;#39;t that awesome</text>
  <text start="147.37" dur="4.56">with the CBO I mean their track ride</text>
  <text start="150.19" dur="3.78">track record is almost as good as the</text>
  <text start="151.93" dur="4.559">Federal Reserve here now if we go back</text>
  <text start="153.97" dur="3.83">in time and we look at Obamacare and the</text>
  <text start="156.489" dur="3.891">number of enrollments they were</text>
  <text start="157.8" dur="6.64">predicting forecasting I should say</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="6.07">going back to 2014 2015 they said well</text>
  <text start="164.44" dur="4.86">in 2014 there&amp;#39;s gonna be six million</text>
  <text start="166.45" dur="3.69">people 2015 it&amp;#39;s gonna hit about 13</text>
  <text start="169.3" dur="3.39">million people</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="4.679">midway through 2015 we&amp;#39;re gonna hit 22</text>
  <text start="172.69" dur="5.51">million people and it&amp;#39;s gonna look</text>
  <text start="174.819" dur="6.84">fantastic now that was the CBO</text>
  <text start="178.2" dur="5.14">predicting all this back in 2010 for all</text>
  <text start="181.659" dur="4.08">these years then they went ahead and</text>
  <text start="183.34" dur="4.08">they revised their numbers and if we</text>
  <text start="185.739" dur="3.601">look at the CBO of 2016</text>
  <text start="187.42" dur="5.1">they said well it looks more like about</text>
  <text start="189.34" dur="5.479">19 million people ago or 19 18 million</text>
  <text start="192.52" dur="4.92">people are gonna be joining Obamacare</text>
  <text start="194.819" dur="6.761">well actually what has been happening</text>
  <text start="197.44" dur="6.99">since 2014 6 million people join it went</text>
  <text start="201.58" dur="6.33">up to 10 million and the actual numbers</text>
  <text start="204.43" dur="6.36">have been declining ever since 10 11 9</text>
  <text start="207.91" dur="6.329">and most likely we&amp;#39;re at 8 going down</text>
  <text start="210.79" dur="5.699">the 7 and it&amp;#39;s continually declining at</text>
  <text start="214.239" dur="5.941">this point and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="216.489" dur="7.321">their forecasts are absolutely terrible</text>
  <text start="220.18" dur="5.369">and they really don&amp;#39;t understand what</text>
  <text start="223.81" dur="5.1">the American people are doing or what</text>
  <text start="225.549" dur="6.361">they really think of Obamacare and why</text>
  <text start="228.91" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re not actually taking this health</text>
  <text start="231.91" dur="5.94">insurance and it&amp;#39;s completely obvious</text>
  <text start="234.31" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s just too expensive there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="237.85" dur="5.04">benefit to the people yes there is some</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="3.929">benefit to a small group of people</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="3.569">especially those individuals that are</text>
  <text start="244.269" dur="4.021">getting subsidized anyone that&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="246.459" dur="3.06">subsidized it&amp;#39;s fantastic because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.29" dur="2.61">not paying anything out of your own</text>
  <text start="249.519" dur="5.19">pocket and if you are paying something</text>
  <text start="250.9" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s so minuscule that yeah I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="254.709" dur="5.4">love it but the majority of the people</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="6.69">guess what they&amp;#39;re left out in the cold</text>
  <text start="260.109" dur="6.301">cold and they have to pay that gigantic</text>
  <text start="263.95" dur="6.33">bill and this is why people are looking</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="6.06">at this thing it&amp;#39;s not working so when</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="3.87">we hear these terms CBO in their</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="3.33">forecast and how many people are gonna</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="4.019">lose this and how many people are gonna</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="4.2">lose this well we really shouldn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="278.169" dur="4.351">take this at face value we should look</text>
  <text start="280" dur="5.82">at their track record and see what they</text>
  <text start="282.52" dur="6.09">really forecasted in the past now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="5.31">starting to hear that more Russia</text>
  <text start="288.61" dur="4.32">propaganda is coming out and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="4.53">know about you but it&amp;#39;s becoming a</text>
  <text start="292.93" dur="4.32">little tiresome and a little ridiculous</text>
  <text start="295.66" dur="4.29">after a while because all we hear is</text>
  <text start="297.25" dur="5.82">Russia Russia Russia and these corporate</text>
  <text start="299.95" dur="6.99">media news outlets they keep pushing</text>
  <text start="303.07" dur="6.75">propaganda and as we find out that none</text>
  <text start="306.94" dur="4.83">of these stories are actually true a lot</text>
  <text start="309.82" dur="3.9">of them are just made up they all turn</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="3.48">out to be nothing burgers and even if</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="5.49">there was something there they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="315.25" dur="5.789">not against the law and the latest one</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="5.329">is with Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="321.039" dur="6.481">and of course this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="324.539" dur="5.291">Washington Post saying that you know</text>
  <text start="327.52" dur="5.22">former Russian ambassador Sergei Kiss</text>
  <text start="329.83" dur="5.669">lyac mal had two conversations with Jeff</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="5.579">Sessions and they were intercepted by</text>
  <text start="335.499" dur="4.32">the NSA which was monitoring the</text>
  <text start="338.319" dur="3.93">communications of senior Russian</text>
  <text start="339.819" dur="5.82">officials in the US and in Russia and</text>
  <text start="342.249" dur="6.45">the bigger question is once again how do</text>
  <text start="345.639" dur="5.61">they know it&amp;#39;s Jeff Sessions unless he</text>
  <text start="348.699" dur="5.64">was unmasked and we&amp;#39;re back to the same</text>
  <text start="351.249" dur="6.66">exact question once again who ordered</text>
  <text start="354.339" dur="7.23">this who ordered the unmasking was Obama</text>
  <text start="357.909" dur="5.581">indeed spying on the Trump campaign and</text>
  <text start="361.569" dur="6.15">that is all turn out to be absolutely</text>
  <text start="363.49" dur="7.789">true and when we drill down to all of</text>
  <text start="367.719" dur="6.81">this what do we really see well</text>
  <text start="371.279" dur="5.11">according to the Washington Post they</text>
  <text start="374.529" dur="4.771">waited until the end of the story to</text>
  <text start="376.389" dur="5.4">disclose one key detail about kiss Lee X</text>
  <text start="379.3" dur="4.38">report to his superiors concerning his</text>
  <text start="381.789" dur="4.35">meetings with sessions according to kiss</text>
  <text start="383.68" dur="4.259">lyac sessions didn&amp;#39;t discuss anything</text>
  <text start="386.139" dur="4.5">that could have influenced the election</text>
  <text start="387.939" dur="5.46">nothing here fits in with the Don jr.</text>
  <text start="390.639" dur="4.981">collusion narrative and and more</text>
  <text start="393.399" dur="4.95">importantly there&amp;#39;s no way to cooperate</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="5.189">Kris yeah kiss lacks characterization of</text>
  <text start="398.349" dur="5.85">the meeting apparently he really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="400.809" dur="5.58">take such meticulous notes like FBI</text>
  <text start="404.199" dur="4.32">director James Comey and we have to</text>
  <text start="406.389" dur="4.68">remember part of any ambassadors job is</text>
  <text start="408.519" dur="5.01">to meet with lawmakers promote your</text>
  <text start="411.069" dur="5.13">country&amp;#39;s agenda and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="413.529" dur="4.89">what kiss lyac was doing he was meeting</text>
  <text start="416.199" dur="4.59">with many different lawmakers but the</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="5.31">question always comes back to the same</text>
  <text start="420.789" dur="6.511">thing where did they get the information</text>
  <text start="423.729" dur="6.54">about the conversation how do they know</text>
  <text start="427.3" dur="5.489">it Jeff Sessions who did the unmasking</text>
  <text start="430.269" dur="5.19">was Obama spying on the Trump</text>
  <text start="432.789" dur="6.3">administration and that all turns out to</text>
  <text start="435.459" dur="5.58">be true now Sarah Flores the spokeswoman</text>
  <text start="439.089" dur="5.1">for the Justice Department says listen I</text>
  <text start="441.039" dur="5.72">cannot comment on the reliability of</text>
  <text start="444.189" dur="5.13">what anonymous sources described</text>
  <text start="446.759" dur="4.601">especially this coming out of the</text>
  <text start="449.319" dur="3.87">Washington Post because there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="451.36" dur="2.62">here it&amp;#39;s all anonymous</text>
  <text start="453.189" dur="4.991">there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="453.98" dur="6.6">meet to it and once again there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.18" dur="5.25">nothing here it&amp;#39;s a nothing burger it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.58" dur="4.92">a waste of time but the corporate media</text>
  <text start="463.43" dur="5.46">they just don&amp;#39;t want to let up on this</text>
  <text start="465.5" dur="6.66">now a more important story is the Trump</text>
  <text start="468.89" dur="6.87">dossier and how they faked and created</text>
  <text start="472.16" dur="6.03">this dossier and how this fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="475.76" dur="5.28">pushed it out there to make everyone</text>
  <text start="478.19" dur="5.28">believe that it was real I mean think</text>
  <text start="481.04" dur="5.79">about what they did now Glenn Simpson</text>
  <text start="483.47" dur="6.12">and Christopher Steele the two that were</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="5.67">involved in this and remember Glenn sips</text>
  <text start="489.59" dur="6.81">Simpson was a former Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="492.5" dur="6.21">reporter who now runs the fusion GPS and</text>
  <text start="496.4" dur="5.7">he&amp;#39;s the one who compiled the dossier</text>
  <text start="498.71" dur="7.11">and Steele wrote up the dossier and this</text>
  <text start="502.1" dur="5.7">was all unverified now the Senate wanted</text>
  <text start="505.82" dur="4.08">them to testify and of course these two</text>
  <text start="507.8" dur="4.35">are saying well our schedules and this</text>
  <text start="509.9" dur="4.079">and that will be traveling so it looks</text>
  <text start="512.15" dur="4.8">like they&amp;#39;re going to be subpoenaed now</text>
  <text start="513.979" dur="5.581">if they are subpoenaed it looks like</text>
  <text start="516.95" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re going to plead the fifth because</text>
  <text start="519.56" dur="6.84">if they testify it&amp;#39;s all gonna come back</text>
  <text start="523.16" dur="5.88">on them and this will be a scandal that</text>
  <text start="526.4" dur="6.06">will be ripped wide open and this is</text>
  <text start="529.04" dur="4.17">when we go down the path of why did you</text>
  <text start="532.46" dur="3.75">do this</text>
  <text start="533.21" dur="5.64">who else was working with you who paid</text>
  <text start="536.21" dur="4.98">you to do this and once they start</text>
  <text start="538.85" dur="4.86">following the money once they start</text>
  <text start="541.19" dur="4.47">following everything you know most</text>
  <text start="543.71" dur="4.53">likely where this is going to lead all</text>
  <text start="545.66" dur="4.71">the way back to the Clinton campaign and</text>
  <text start="548.24" dur="5.49">this is why they&amp;#39;re going to avoid all</text>
  <text start="550.37" dur="7.17">of this and we see right now that most</text>
  <text start="553.73" dur="6.6">of the information that the Senate wants</text>
  <text start="557.54" dur="5.64">well it&amp;#39;s coming from these individuals</text>
  <text start="560.33" dur="5.76">and it looks like they are going to</text>
  <text start="563.18" dur="5.63">decline the subpoena they&amp;#39;re gonna plead</text>
  <text start="566.09" dur="5.55">the fifth and they&amp;#39;re gonna say listen</text>
  <text start="568.81" dur="5.95">we&amp;#39;re invoking all of this because we</text>
  <text start="571.64" dur="4.68">have nothing to say now Susan Rice she</text>
  <text start="574.76" dur="4.83">met privately with the Senate</text>
  <text start="576.32" dur="5.43">Intelligence Committee and none of the</text>
  <text start="579.59" dur="4.23">information is really coming out but she</text>
  <text start="581.75" dur="4.02">didn&amp;#39;t meet with them behind closed</text>
  <text start="583.82" dur="3.57">doors and they discussed you know the</text>
  <text start="585.77" dur="3.51">unmasking and</text>
  <text start="587.39" dur="3.81">what actually went on but again it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="589.28" dur="6.69">out in the public like all the other</text>
  <text start="591.2" dur="7.5">hearings now we see Mike Pompeo the CIA</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="6.15">director right now he is out there and</text>
  <text start="598.7" dur="6.27">he is going after WikiLeaks he is saying</text>
  <text start="602.12" dur="5.37">that WikiLeaks is plotting to take down</text>
  <text start="604.97" dur="5.93">America any way they can find any</text>
  <text start="607.49" dur="7.77">willing partner to achieve that end and</text>
  <text start="610.9" dur="6.46">the question is what is he so worried</text>
  <text start="615.26" dur="4.41">about is he worried that the American</text>
  <text start="617.36" dur="5.16">people will find out the truth and will</text>
  <text start="619.67" dur="5.88">take the intelligent agency down will</text>
  <text start="622.52" dur="5.22">take down parts of the government if the</text>
  <text start="625.55" dur="5.1">truth is that there actually Assange</text>
  <text start="627.74" dur="7.1">tweeted out there saying what sort of</text>
  <text start="630.65" dur="7.76">America can be taken down by the truth</text>
  <text start="634.84" dur="4.99">this is what they&amp;#39;re really afraid of</text>
  <text start="638.41" dur="4.3">the truth</text>
  <text start="639.83" dur="5.4">getting out there and people really</text>
  <text start="642.71" dur="4.89">learning what the government what the</text>
  <text start="645.23" dur="6.45">intelligence agencies were really up to</text>
  <text start="647.6" dur="6.42">over all these years and this is why</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop this type of</text>
  <text start="654.02" dur="4.89">organization you have to remember Trump</text>
  <text start="656" dur="5.1">when he was campaigning he actually said</text>
  <text start="658.91" dur="6.72">I love WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="661.1" dur="6.24">and now all of a sudden the CIA everyone</text>
  <text start="665.63" dur="4.2">is looking at WikiLeaks saying no we</text>
  <text start="667.34" dur="4.65">need to stop this because something</text>
  <text start="669.83" dur="5.94">behind the curtain something behind</text>
  <text start="671.99" dur="6.15">there they&amp;#39;re very much afraid of now it</text>

  <text start="1002.16" dur="4.34">supported by the intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="1004.56" dur="4.68">now we see US Special Operations</text>
  <text start="1006.5" dur="6.1">commander he is out there and he</text>
  <text start="1009.24" dur="6.51">admitted that having the u.s. stay in</text>
  <text start="1012.6" dur="7.07">Syria for a long period of time runs</text>
  <text start="1015.75" dur="6.6">contrary to international law and Russia</text>
  <text start="1019.67" dur="6.16">they would be entirely justified in</text>
  <text start="1022.35" dur="6.78">questioning the USS presence in Syria</text>

  <text start="1036.09" dur="5.22">remain in Syria after the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1038.16" dur="6.6">is defeated to support the Kurdish</text>

  <text start="1055.17" dur="3.9">in this country and I&amp;#39;m going to take</text>
  <text start="1056.88" dur="5.55">this a step further we have no right to</text>
  <text start="1059.07" dur="6.42">be in this country because the sovereign</text>
  <text start="1062.43" dur="5.76">countries leader never invited the</text>
  <text start="1065.49" dur="5.01">United States in and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="1068.19" dur="5.16">this would be completely against</text>
  <text start="1070.5" dur="5.25">international law and he went on to say</text>
  <text start="1073.35" dur="7.56">we are operating in a sovereign country</text>
  <text start="1075.75" dur="10.41">the Russians they are there by request</text>
  <text start="1080.91" dur="9.87">of the Syrian President and we can see</text>
  <text start="1086.16" dur="8.16">that if Russia and Syria say listen why</text>
  <text start="1090.78" dur="7.68">is the US still in Syria and if Russia</text>
  <text start="1094.32" dur="5.97">does play this card well the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1098.46" dur="5.34">going to have to leave because under</text>
  <text start="1100.29" dur="6.48">international law they have no right to</text>
  <text start="1103.8" dur="5.94">be there and it&amp;#39;s nice to see that</text>

  <text start="1139.46" dur="5.73">individuals most of these troops they</text>
  <text start="1142.04" dur="6.24">need to leave and we can see already</text>
  <text start="1145.19" dur="5.64">there&amp;#39;s already calls where the</text>
  <text start="1148.28" dur="6.51">coalition forces must leave the country</text>
  <text start="1150.83" dur="6.45">now Syria is taking this to the next</text>
  <text start="1154.79" dur="6.93">step here they&amp;#39;re saying they want the</text>
  <text start="1157.28" dur="7.86">US and it&amp;#39;s illegitimate coalition to</text>
  <text start="1161.72" dur="6.23">pay for all the infrastructure they</text>

  <text start="1167.95" dur="5.5">they want the u.s. to pay for all the</text>
  <text start="1171.71" dur="6">damage almost like after World War two</text>
  <text start="1173.45" dur="7.23">where the German people the German</text>

  <text start="1180.68" dur="4.89">countries for the damage they created on</text>
  <text start="1183.44" dur="5.67">all the countries now it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1185.57" dur="6.77">the US has turned the deep state where</text>
  <text start="1189.11" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re saying listen you are here</text>
  <text start="1192.34" dur="4.02">illegally</text>
  <text start="1193.61" dur="6.54">you destroyed our infrastructure and you</text>
  <text start="1196.36" dur="6.94">need to pay for it now this might even</text>
  <text start="1200.15" dur="4.41">turn into war crimes as we move forward</text>
  <text start="1203.3" dur="4.71">because as more of this information</text>
  <text start="1204.56" dur="6.27">comes out remember the losers the ones</text>
  <text start="1208.01" dur="6.03">who really weren&amp;#39;t supposed to be there</text>
  <text start="1210.83" dur="5.7">well everything flashes back on them and</text>
  <text start="1214.04" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re starting to see this happen right</text>
  <text start="1216.53" dur="5.79">now because now we have Syria most</text>
  <text start="1219.86" dur="6.3">likely other countries going to go to</text>

  <text start="1226.16" dur="3.21">needs to pay for all this look what</text>
  <text start="1227.9" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ve done to all of these countries</text>
  <text start="1229.37" dur="6.18">now again where does this all go back to</text>
  <text start="1232.37" dur="5.49">it goes back to the people now we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1235.55" dur="5.49">elect we didn&amp;#39;t vote for this to happen</text>
  <text start="1237.86" dur="7.14">this was being done through the deep</text>
  <text start="1241.04" dur="6.87">state covertly and once again these</text>
  <text start="1245" dur="4.74">individuals were lying to the people of</text>
  <text start="1247.91" dur="3.29">the United States of why we were there</text>
  <text start="1249.74" dur="4.56">in the first place</text>
  <text start="1251.2" dur="4.06">so again we could see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1254.3" dur="3.72">now</text>
  <text start="1255.26" dur="6.48">while this is all happening what we see</text>
  <text start="1258.02" dur="4.95">happening is that America is now losing</text>
  <text start="1261.74" dur="4.76">its grip on the Middle East now we</text>
  <text start="1262.97" dur="6.75">talked about this quite often where as</text>
  <text start="1266.5" dur="6.07">the u.s. loses its grip in the Middle</text>
  <text start="1269.72" dur="5.4">East these countries are going to go off</text>

  <text start="1275.12" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re been doing they&amp;#39;ve been moving</text>
  <text start="1276.86" dur="6.21">towards Russia China and Iran now while</text>
  <text start="1280.16" dur="4.62">the u.s. the deep state was so busy</text>

  <text start="1304.88" dur="7.22">to Russia and China and ran and Iran to</text>
  <text start="1308.63" dur="7.2">invest in the Middle East not the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1312.1" dur="7.41">we also see that Syria and Iran they are</text>
