  <text start="78.7" dur="6.33">of the blockchain technology now</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="4.449">normally central bankers wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="85.03" dur="4.56">mention anything about anything else</text>
  <text start="87.009" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s going on around the world that</text>
  <text start="89.59" dur="4.169">doesn&amp;#39;t affect their business I mean</text>
  <text start="92.259" dur="3.241">they&amp;#39;re afraid of gold and silver so</text>

  <text start="95.5" dur="4.619">don&amp;#39;t need to own it it&amp;#39;s not a store of</text>

  <text start="111.399" dur="4.201">continually talking about crypto</text>
  <text start="113.77" dur="4.59">currencies San Francisco Fed President</text>
  <text start="115.6" dur="7.049">John Williams laid out a case for why</text>
  <text start="118.36" dur="7.08">crypto currencies will never replace</text>
  <text start="122.649" dur="4.791">paper money now</text>
  <text start="125.44" dur="4.8">let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="127.44" dur="6.73">they&amp;#39;re out there telling everyone that</text>
  <text start="130.24" dur="7.23">the blockchain technology that is</text>
  <text start="134.17" dur="6.21">growing today by leaps and bounds</text>
  <text start="137.47" dur="5.57">more and more coins are coming out they</text>
  <text start="140.38" dur="7.32">are saying that that is never going to</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="7.18">replace their system this is how afraid</text>
  <text start="147.7" dur="4.53">they are because you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="150.22" dur="4.67">say that unless you&amp;#39;re nervous and</text>
  <text start="152.23" dur="5.46">afraid now they went on to say that</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="5.02">first of all it&amp;#39;s volatile so it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="157.69" dur="3.269">be very difficult to hold because one</text>
  <text start="159.91" dur="3.09">day it&amp;#39;s going to be up the next day</text>
  <text start="160.959" dur="3.151">it&amp;#39;s gonna be down and it&amp;#39;s so volatile</text>
  <text start="163" dur="3.54">that you never know where it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="164.11" dur="5.31">be not like the Faik currency that they</text>
  <text start="166.54" dur="5.88">can control where you always know how</text>
  <text start="169.42" dur="6.21">much it&amp;#39;s worth except it is lost about</text>
  <text start="172.42" dur="7.679">what 97% of its value since inception of</text>
  <text start="175.63" dur="6.51">course they do it behind and behind the</text>
  <text start="180.099" dur="4.141">scenes stealthily so you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="182.14" dur="4.17">what&amp;#39;s going on you don&amp;#39;t realize that</text>
  <text start="184.24" dur="2.579">it&amp;#39;s losing what they tell you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.31" dur="2.039">in</text>
  <text start="186.819" dur="2.821">Latian inflation is good don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="188.349" dur="2.821">about that you&amp;#39;re just gonna pay a lot</text>
  <text start="189.64" dur="5.04">more for that and what that really means</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="5.37">is the value of those dollars</text>
  <text start="194.68" dur="3.869">continually decline that&amp;#39;s why you need</text>
  <text start="196.54" dur="3.479">a lot more of them to pay for the same</text>
  <text start="198.549" dur="3">exact thing think about it you go out</text>
  <text start="200.019" dur="2.881">and you purchase an automobile every one</text>
  <text start="201.549" dur="3.871">things well the automobile went up in</text>
  <text start="202.9" dur="5.399">price know the value of that currency</text>
  <text start="205.42" dur="5.31">continually drops and that&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.299" dur="4.92">paying more but they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="210.73" dur="4.349">the case of why you shouldn&amp;#39;t be looking</text>
  <text start="213.219" dur="4.38">at cryptocurrencies and why it will</text>
  <text start="215.079" dur="7.11">never replace it now they also went on</text>
  <text start="217.599" dur="7.32">to say that the cryptocurrency doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="222.189" dur="4.711">pass the basic test of what a currency</text>
  <text start="224.919" dur="4.53">should be you know of course this is the</text>
  <text start="226.9" dur="3.959">central bank currency test where you can</text>
  <text start="229.449" dur="3.481">print as much as you want</text>
  <text start="230.859" dur="4.53">and there&amp;#39;s no limits whatsoever</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="4.739">remember gold you only have a certain</text>
  <text start="235.389" dur="5.671">amount of gold you hold that and then</text>
  <text start="237.669" dur="5.611">you create the currency to basically</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="4.53">match the amount of gold that you have</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="5.429">this way there&amp;#39;s checks and balances</text>
  <text start="245.59" dur="6.179">crypto currencies there&amp;#39;s a finite</text>
  <text start="248.709" dur="4.95">amount that you can create so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.769" dur="5.071">always checks and balances plus there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.659" dur="5.58">a ledger system which shows every single</text>
  <text start="256.84" dur="7.62">transaction not like the file system</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="7.981">where the cash can be used for nefarious</text>
  <text start="264.46" dur="4.139">means so basically they&amp;#39;re saying it</text>
  <text start="267.22" dur="3.629">doesn&amp;#39;t fit into their model because as</text>
  <text start="268.599" dur="3.511">a central banker what you want is you</text>
  <text start="270.849" dur="3.57">want to be able to print as much as you</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="4.77">possibly can and have these funds</text>
  <text start="274.419" dur="6">diverted to other areas place sanctions</text>
  <text start="276.88" dur="4.86">on others and control countries so</text>
  <text start="280.419" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re very very nervous about</text>
  <text start="281.74" dur="3.269">cryptocurrency that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="283.539" dur="4.201">continually come out and tell you about</text>
  <text start="285.009" dur="6.121">it now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="7.679">next generation the Millennials they are</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="7.469">doing absolutely horrible in this</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="4.8">economy now a new report was released by</text>

  <text start="310.81" dur="3.99">financial well-being of millennials</text>
  <text start="312.159" dur="5.79">today versus baby boomers when they were</text>
  <text start="314.8" dur="5.89">in their adolescence for the first time</text>
  <text start="317.949" dur="4.841">young adults aged 25 to 34</text>
  <text start="320.69" dur="5.15">with college degrees and student loans</text>
  <text start="322.79" dur="6.18">have a medium net wealth of negative</text>

  <text start="328.97" dur="5.82">generation had a positive net wealth of</text>
  <text start="331.7" dur="5.76">9,000 in 2013 but since the accumulation</text>
  <text start="334.79" dur="5.91">of debt has turned America&amp;#39;s future</text>
  <text start="337.46" dur="5.22">leaders into the walking dead the report</text>
  <text start="340.7" dur="5.24">update shows new disturbing trends for</text>
  <text start="342.68" dur="8.37">Millennials including for the first time</text>
  <text start="345.94" dur="6.01">they have a negative net worth home</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="2.91">ownership</text>
  <text start="351.95" dur="4.77">among young people continued to trend</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="4.65">downward and once again they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="356.72" dur="3.06">making enough money to purchase these</text>
  <text start="358.61" dur="3.27">houses remember they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="359.78" dur="6.33">student loans they can&amp;#39;t find high</text>
  <text start="361.88" dur="6.66">paying jobs and right now everything is</text>
  <text start="366.11" dur="4.05">a lot worse than it was when we first</text>
  <text start="368.54" dur="4.98">came on the fight system now this is</text>
  <text start="370.16" dur="7.23">what it looks like when we&amp;#39;re at the end</text>
  <text start="373.52" dur="6.51">stages of a central banking system it</text>
  <text start="377.39" dur="5.97">starts out great and you get into that</text>
  <text start="380.03" dur="5.1">middle road where credit you know is out</text>
  <text start="383.36" dur="3.84">there and it&amp;#39;s plentiful everyone can</text>
  <text start="385.13" dur="3.99">get credit put your people into more and</text>
  <text start="387.2" dur="4.23">more debt because remember the central</text>
  <text start="389.12" dur="4.95">banking system is based on debt and as</text>
  <text start="391.43" dur="5.79">people pile up debt as the world piles</text>
  <text start="394.07" dur="4.8">up debt the system just breaks down and</text>
  <text start="397.22" dur="3.92">they know this this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="5.46">always prepared and ready to basically</text>
  <text start="401.14" dur="5.83">restart the entire system now we do have</text>
  <text start="404.33" dur="4.5">proof that the younger generation</text>
  <text start="406.97" dur="3.449">they&amp;#39;re not going out purchasing homes</text>
  <text start="408.83" dur="3.69">this is why when you hear on the</text>
  <text start="410.419" dur="3.061">corporate media and the Fed and the</text>
  <text start="412.52" dur="2.46">government numbers saying that</text>
  <text start="413.48" dur="4.56">everyone&amp;#39;s purchasing a home that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.98" dur="6.12">ridiculous because think about this US</text>
  <text start="418.04" dur="5.4">banks they are racing to launch website</text>
  <text start="421.1" dur="5.64">to mobile apps to make getting a</text>
  <text start="423.44" dur="7.2">mortgage faster and easier the problem</text>
  <text start="426.74" dur="6.51">is right now refinancing volumes they</text>
  <text start="430.64" dur="6.72">have plunged plunged as interest rates</text>
  <text start="433.25" dur="8.31">have risen lenders right now are having</text>
  <text start="437.36" dur="6.87">a very difficult time pushing mortgages</text>
  <text start="441.56" dur="4.859">because the people won they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="444.23" dur="4.08">the money when the interest rates rise</text>
  <text start="446.419" dur="4.711">it pushes a lot of these individuals out</text>
  <text start="448.31" dur="3.51">of the market and they&amp;#39;re getting very</text>
  <text start="451.13" dur="3.82">worried</text>
  <text start="451.82" dur="6.43">and this is why there</text>
  <text start="454.95" dur="4.65">pushing these new technologies to try to</text>
  <text start="458.25" dur="3.33">bring in more people but it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="459.6" dur="3.93">to work because what happens is as more</text>
  <text start="461.58" dur="3.03">and more people find part-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="463.53" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re not making the same amount of</text>
  <text start="464.61" dur="5.64">income they were in the past and as</text>
  <text start="467.85" dur="3.84">people have a lot of student loans and a</text>
  <text start="470.25" dur="3.84">lot of debt and a lot of credit card</text>
  <text start="471.69" dur="3.89">debt guess what they&amp;#39;re not going to go</text>
  <text start="474.09" dur="4.35">out and purchase a house and as the</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="4.92">price of homes continually rises because</text>
  <text start="478.44" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re pumping this up with bubbles</text>
  <text start="480.5" dur="5.44">guess what they can&amp;#39;t purchase any of</text>
  <text start="483.27" dur="6.57">this stuff so no matter what the banks</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="7.11">do home lending is slowing right now</text>
  <text start="489.84" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s declining and there&amp;#39;s nothing they</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="4.07">can do about it if you look at Wells</text>
  <text start="494.28" dur="5.22">Fargo it has been trending downward</text>
  <text start="497.12" dur="4.06">since the financial crisis we had a</text>
  <text start="499.5" dur="4.26">little pop up when they pumped</text>
  <text start="501.18" dur="4.11">everything up but everything is moving</text>
  <text start="503.76" dur="3.96">down this is what the report is showing</text>
  <text start="505.29" dur="4.86">about the Millennials home ownership is</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="3.84">at its lowest rate home ownership is</text>
  <text start="510.15" dur="4.079">that it&amp;#39;s what is it were all the way</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="4.109">back to 1972 when the first time when</text>
  <text start="514.229" dur="4.551">the system first came online the new</text>
  <text start="515.669" dur="5.941">Fayette petrol dollar system came online</text>
  <text start="518.78" dur="5.38">so we can see right now all of this is</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="4.41">completely falling apart and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.16" dur="3.81">accelerating right now the economy is</text>
  <text start="526.02" dur="3.84">being ripped apart right now and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="527.97" dur="4.98">nothing that central bankers can do the</text>
  <text start="529.86" dur="6.06">only thing they can do is push us into a</text>
  <text start="532.95" dur="5.1">recession slash collapse scenario to</text>
  <text start="535.92" dur="2.58">restart the system that&amp;#39;s all they have</text>
  <text start="538.05" dur="2.82">left</text>
  <text start="538.5" dur="5.25">pensions right now and we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="540.87" dur="7.68">about this before they&amp;#39;re approaching</text>
  <text start="543.75" dur="6.63">the apocalypse levels earlier this week</text>
  <text start="548.55" dur="4.56">teachers who are part of the Colorado</text>
  <text start="550.38" dur="4.74">public pension system staged a walkout</text>
  <text start="553.11" dur="3.99">protest over proposed changes to the</text>
  <text start="555.12" dur="4.26">plan including raising the percentage</text>
  <text start="557.1" dur="5.1">contribution to the fund by current pays</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="6.18">and raising the retirement age again</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="5.4">because they can&amp;#39;t pay out they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="565.56" dur="5.91">have enough money they&amp;#39;re underfunded</text>
  <text start="567.6" dur="7.5">and if the stock market declines more</text>
  <text start="571.47" dur="6.45">than 10 percent guess what it would</text>
  <text start="575.1" dur="5.4">collapse the pension systems because</text>
  <text start="577.92" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re basing everything off of a stock</text>
  <text start="580.5" dur="4.25">market return because originally they</text>
  <text start="582.96" dur="3.99">base it off a seven eight percent return</text>
  <text start="584.75" dur="3.88">but the interest rates have been so low</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="4.379">they&amp;#39;re looking at the stock</text>
  <text start="588.63" dur="4.29">and if this declines it&amp;#39;s gonna be all</text>
  <text start="591.329" dur="5.19">wiped out it&amp;#39;s gonna be a complete and</text>
  <text start="592.92" dur="6.93">utter disaster so the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="596.519" dur="6.781">right now the central banking system the</text>
  <text start="599.85" dur="6.179">only place they can go is not more</text>
  <text start="603.3" dur="5.19">stimulus but a crash of the system</text>
  <text start="606.029" dur="3.99">because they will need to crash it to</text>
  <text start="608.49" dur="3.87">blame it on someone else remember their</text>
  <text start="610.019" dur="5.791">system only lasts for a certain period</text>
  <text start="612.36" dur="4.529">of time now when this system crashes and</text>
  <text start="615.81" dur="3.5">when the whole thing starts to fall</text>
  <text start="616.889" dur="4.411">apart depending on who has the narrative</text>
  <text start="619.31" dur="4.24">someone&amp;#39;s going to be responsible for</text>
  <text start="621.3" dur="4.08">the debt now the central bankers if they</text>
  <text start="623.55" dur="3.75">are able to keep the narrative of the</text>
  <text start="625.38" dur="4.5">story and they can create the story of</text>
  <text start="627.3" dur="4.14">why the global system has collapsed and</text>
  <text start="629.88" dur="4.139">they can blame it on Trump or war</text>
  <text start="631.44" dur="5.28">whatever they&amp;#39;re going to do they want</text>
  <text start="634.019" dur="4.411">everyone to know and realize that the</text>
  <text start="636.72" dur="4.14">debt that is out there they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="638.43" dur="4.8">get rid of it they&amp;#39;re gonna tell the</text>
  <text start="640.86" dur="4.589">people that they are responsible and we</text>
  <text start="643.23" dur="4.71">see Angela Merkel and Makran they were</text>
  <text start="645.449" dur="5.88">meeting and Merkel came out with this</text>
  <text start="647.94" dur="6.24">warning to German savers by telling them</text>
  <text start="651.329" dur="6.961">they will end up footing the bill if the</text>
  <text start="654.18" dur="5.82">eurozone fails they said there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="658.29" dur="6">number of bad loans especially in Italy</text>
  <text start="660" dur="8.49">and the banks they&amp;#39;re insolvent and they</text>
  <text start="664.29" dur="8.279">know if the EU goes down guess what who</text>
  <text start="668.49" dur="6.57">is going to be responsible for all this</text>
  <text start="672.569" dur="5.13">debt and the establishment is telling</text>
  <text start="675.06" dur="5.79">the people you are responsible for all</text>
  <text start="677.699" dur="5.37">of this and it just isn&amp;#39;t to europe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="680.85" dur="4.53">to the United States you&amp;#39;re gonna hear</text>
  <text start="683.069" dur="3.87">the establishment say the people are</text>
  <text start="685.38" dur="3.78">responsible for the step because the</text>
  <text start="686.939" dur="5.971">central bankers they&amp;#39;re letting you know</text>
  <text start="689.16" dur="6.989">you are responsible for all of this now</text>
  <text start="692.91" dur="5.13">again this is the central bank debt now</text>
  <text start="696.149" dur="5.55">if we can show that they created this</text>
  <text start="698.04" dur="5.58">debt through other means which means we</text>
  <text start="701.699" dur="3.87">need to audit the central banks which</text>
  <text start="703.62" dur="5.04">means the governments around the world</text>
  <text start="705.569" dur="4.741">would need to basically pass laws to say</text>
  <text start="708.66" dur="3.479">we need to look into the central banking</text>
  <text start="710.31" dur="3.629">system we need to look into the eurozone</text>
  <text start="712.139" dur="4.651">system we need to look into all of this</text>
  <text start="713.939" dur="4.531">that is the only way most likely we can</text>
  <text start="716.79" dur="3.84">get out of debt unless we just go around</text>
  <text start="718.47" dur="3.48">arrest all the bankers and put them in</text>
  <text start="720.63" dur="3.27">jail and say yeah we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="721.95" dur="4.65">this at all but again we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="723.9" dur="5.28">to show and through a legal process of</text>
  <text start="726.6" dur="5.01">why they need to be in jail what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="729.18" dur="5.43">done and I think that time is</text>
  <text start="731.61" dur="5.28">approaching now the IMF they are very</text>
  <text start="734.61" dur="4.67">nervous about what China and the United</text>
  <text start="736.89" dur="4.68">States are doing they&amp;#39;re saying listen</text>
  <text start="739.28" dur="4.6">China in the u.s. they need to resolve</text>
  <text start="741.57" dur="4.02">their looming trade disputes they need</text>
  <text start="743.88" dur="4.26">to come together work something out</text>
  <text start="745.59" dur="4.29">because if they don&amp;#39;t this is going to</text>
  <text start="748.14" dur="4.8">be a complete and utter disaster around</text>
  <text start="749.88" dur="6.9">the world the global economic system</text>
  <text start="752.94" dur="6.15">will crash if we have a trade war</text>
  <text start="756.78" dur="4.44">I believe that China and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="759.09" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re doing this on purpose they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="761.22" dur="5.52">working together to shut down the</text>
  <text start="763.56" dur="7.2">central banking system this is the main</text>
  <text start="766.74" dur="5.73">goal and if we go back to Q&amp;#39;s posts and</text>
  <text start="770.76" dur="8.16">if we all go all the way back to post</text>
  <text start="772.47" dur="7.74">138 q said the Fed and the IRS fact US</text>
  <text start="778.92" dur="3.6">Federal Reserve is a privately owned</text>
  <text start="780.21" dur="5.82">company sitting on it&amp;#39;s very own patch</text>
  <text start="782.52" dur="5.52">of land immune to the US laws which</text>
  <text start="786.03" dur="5.49">means that we need to go after that now</text>
  <text start="788.04" dur="6.62">q had a question-and-answer session with</text>
  <text start="791.52" dur="6.48">an ins and somebody asks the question</text>
  <text start="794.66" dur="5.62">Federal Reserve ending and Q answered</text>
  <text start="798" dur="4.5">structure now what is the meaning of</text>
  <text start="800.28" dur="4.92">structure the arrangement of and</text>
  <text start="802.5" dur="6.48">relations between the parts or elements</text>
  <text start="805.2" dur="5.76">of something complex so what I believe Q</text>
  <text start="808.98" dur="4.19">is saying is yet yes this is a huge</text>
  <text start="810.96" dur="5.03">structure and these elements are</text>
  <text start="813.17" dur="5.95">intertwined into a very complex system</text>
  <text start="815.99" dur="5.98">which again goes with the deep state</text>
  <text start="819.12" dur="4.8">with then goes with the IMF with the biz</text>
  <text start="821.97" dur="3.66">with everything else and it&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="823.92" dur="3.96">complex system that has to be taken down</text>
  <text start="825.63" dur="4.35">and it can&amp;#39;t just be one nation it has</text>
  <text start="827.88" dur="4.26">to be many nations pulled together to</text>
  <text start="829.98" dur="4.23">take everything down at the same exact</text>
  <text start="832.14" dur="3.57">time and I think this is why Trump again</text>
  <text start="834.21" dur="3.33">has entered Jackson hanging on the wall</text>
  <text start="835.71" dur="4.29">in the White House working with Putin</text>
  <text start="837.54" dur="6.06">working with China pushing the central</text>
  <text start="840" dur="6.51">bank system to the very edge now while</text>
  <text start="843.6" dur="5.76">all this is happening right now we see</text>
  <text start="846.51" dur="6.54">Russia again they don&amp;#39;t have any bullion</text>
  <text start="849.36" dur="6.54">in the u.s. vaults they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="853.05" dur="4.77">no one can lay their hands on our goal</text>
  <text start="855.9" dur="3.69">same thing with China they pretty much</text>
  <text start="857.82" dur="4.2">have all their gold and we see Turkey</text>
  <text start="859.59" dur="5.01">and other countries are asking for their</text>
  <text start="862.02" dur="5.07">gold back because they realize what is</text>
  <text start="864.6" dur="4.59">about to happen here and that about the</text>
  <text start="867.09" dur="3.84">happen thing is the entire system is</text>
  <text start="869.19" dur="3.48">gonna be coming down and everyone wants</text>
  <text start="870.93" dur="3.78">to make sure that they have their gold</text>
  <text start="872.67" dur="4.77">because those countries that have the</text>
  <text start="874.71" dur="5">gold they will be able to weather the</text>
  <text start="877.44" dur="5.4">storm now Venezuela on the other hand</text>
  <text start="879.71" dur="5.92">their gold reserves are jaw-dropping</text>
  <text start="882.84" dur="4.14">very very quickly they are in a huge</text>
  <text start="885.63" dur="3.15">amount of trouble we know that the</text>
  <text start="886.98" dur="3.57">United States and I should say the deep</text>
  <text start="888.78" dur="3.81">state is putting a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="890.55" dur="3.87">Venezuela again this is one of the</text>
  <text start="892.59" dur="5.13">countries they wanted to get into to</text>
  <text start="894.42" dur="5.37">basically get a hold of their oil</text>
  <text start="897.72" dur="3.78">reserves sell their oils using the</text>
  <text start="899.79" dur="4.74">dollar to try to keep the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="901.5" dur="4.95">system up and running and we see right</text>
  <text start="904.53" dur="4.47">now that Venezuela is doing everything</text>
  <text start="906.45" dur="4.95">they possibly can to bypass the dollar</text>
  <text start="909" dur="4.53">and get around all the sanctions just</text>
  <text start="911.4" dur="3.45">like every other country and pretty soon</text>
  <text start="913.53" dur="3.6">these sanctions are gonna be a thing of</text>
  <text start="914.85" dur="4.29">the past because once the u.s. is no</text>
  <text start="917.13" dur="3.99">longer the reserve currency the deep</text>
  <text start="919.14" dur="4.23">state the central bankers they will lose</text>
  <text start="921.12" dur="5.61">control now because of what is happening</text>
  <text start="923.37" dur="6">around the world with Russia with the UK</text>
  <text start="926.73" dur="6.35">pointing the fingers at Russia with the</text>
  <text start="929.37" dur="7.23">u.s. the deep state pushing war in Syria</text>
  <text start="933.08" dur="6.88">North Korea not so much anymore a lot of</text>
  <text start="936.6" dur="7.73">global investors they are looking at the</text>
  <text start="939.96" dur="7.05">yuan as the safe haven to invest in</text>
  <text start="944.33" dur="4.93">which is very interesting because a lot</text>
  <text start="947.01" dur="4.8">of global investors now are moving</text>
  <text start="949.26" dur="5.04">towards China China basically has been</text>
  <text start="951.81" dur="5.06">staying very neutral in pretty much</text>
  <text start="954.3" dur="5.91">everything and this is done on purpose</text>
  <text start="956.87" dur="6.73">so this way people see the yuan and as a</text>
  <text start="960.21" dur="5.37">safe haven a place to go to invest in</text>
  <text start="963.6" dur="4.5">because they want everyone out of the</text>
  <text start="965.58" dur="5.43">dollars moving over to the u1 and I</text>
  <text start="968.1" dur="4.71">believe that Xi Jinping and Trump</text>
  <text start="971.01" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re gonna be working to move away</text>
  <text start="972.81" dur="4.17">from the central banking establishment</text>
  <text start="975.12" dur="4.59">even though the central bankers have a</text>
  <text start="976.98" dur="5.19">different plan so we can see that both</text>
  <text start="979.71" dur="5.67">sides are fighting for the narrative to</text>
  <text start="982.17" dur="7.5">take control and what everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="985.38" dur="7.74">do is be prepared for any of these type</text>
  <text start="989.67" dur="5.31">situations now according to Q it seems</text>
  <text start="993.12" dur="4.29">like the Patriots they&amp;#39;re in the lead</text>
  <text start="994.98" dur="4.8">hopefully it stays that way because it</text>
  <text start="997.41" dur="4.02">looks like they&amp;#39;re moving against the</text>
  <text start="999.78" dur="3.45">central bank moving against the deep</text>
  <text start="1001.43" dur="4.68">state moving against these individuals</text>
  <text start="1003.23" dur="5.46">but no matter what happens we are gonna</text>
  <text start="1006.11" dur="4.89">go through a transition the US will no</text>
  <text start="1008.69" dur="3.87">longer be the reserve currency we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1011" dur="4.1">gonna be moving into a different type of</text>
  <text start="1012.56" dur="4.95">currency you&amp;#39;re gonna have to basically</text>
  <text start="1015.1" dur="4.24">safeguard your wealth as you can see</text>
  <text start="1017.51" dur="3.87">other countries are doing this with gold</text>
  <text start="1019.34" dur="4.35">and silver you should also do it with</text>
  <text start="1021.38" dur="3.6">cryptocurrency because as the central</text>
  <text start="1023.69" dur="3.33">bankers continually say that</text>
  <text start="1024.98" dur="4.11">cryptocurrency can never replace Fayette</text>
  <text start="1027.02" dur="5.31">you know that cryptocurrency is going to</text>
  <text start="1029.09" dur="5.73">replace Fayette because they keep saying</text>
  <text start="1032.33" dur="5.04">it and whatever they say it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="1034.82" dur="4.26">opposite just like they said Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="1037.37" dur="3.48">the crypto market the blockchain market</text>
  <text start="1039.08" dur="4.08">it was all done for it was in a bubble</text>
  <text start="1040.85" dur="5.22">it crashed but then we come to find out</text>
  <text start="1043.16" dur="5.55">well there were certain entities that</text>
  <text start="1046.07" dur="5.01">were dumping a huge amount of Bitcoin to</text>
  <text start="1048.71" dur="4.62">bring it all down and after tax day we</text>
  <text start="1051.08" dur="3.9">can see that Bitcoin is moving up once</text>
  <text start="1053.33" dur="3.81">again the other cryptocurrencies are</text>
  <text start="1054.98" dur="4.71">moving up again and believe me this</text>
  <text start="1057.14" dur="4.89">system is not done for as of yet just</text>
  <text start="1059.69" dur="3.93">like with the internet when we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="1062.03" dur="3.18">off the internet 1.0 and a lot of</text>
  <text start="1063.62" dur="3.3">companies fail we at the dot-com bubble</text>
  <text start="1065.21" dur="5.55">everyone said the internet was</text>
  <text start="1066.92" dur="5.52">completely done was it no it wasn&amp;#39;t so</text>
  <text start="1070.76" dur="3.06">no matter what happens you need to guard</text>
  <text start="1072.44" dur="4.23">your wealth of gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1073.82" dur="4.95">you also need crypto currencies you also</text>
  <text start="1076.67" dur="3.33">need food water supplies because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1078.77" dur="3.03">going to see inflation we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="1080" dur="3.66">credit freeze up we&amp;#39;re gonna see the</text>
  <text start="1081.8" dur="3.69">shelves go bare for a little while</text>
  <text start="1083.66" dur="4.23">remember we&amp;#39;re at the end stages of a</text>
  <text start="1085.49" dur="4.8">system and we are moving very very</text>
  <text start="1087.89" dur="3.6">quickly here and you can see the central</text>
  <text start="1090.29" dur="2.85">bankers as they keep coming out with</text>
  <text start="1091.49" dur="3.9">their warnings about regulation on</text>
  <text start="1093.14" dur="4.65">cryptocurrency they keep talking about</text>
  <text start="1095.39" dur="4.89">trade wars how it&amp;#39;s going to damage the</text>
  <text start="1097.79" dur="3.9">global economy you can tell once they</text>
  <text start="1100.28" dur="2.79">start making these type of announcements</text>
  <text start="1101.69" dur="3.09">and they keep repeating themselves over</text>
  <text start="1103.07" dur="5.48">and over and over we&amp;#39;re getting closer</text>
  <text start="1104.78" dur="8.49">and closer to that time so get prepared</text>
