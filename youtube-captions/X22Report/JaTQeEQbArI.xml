  <text start="30.3" dur="5.64">is dave and this is episode 291 and</text>
  <text start="32.46" dur="4.98">today&amp;#39;s date is februari 15 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="35.94" dur="3.209">title of this episode is the current</text>
  <text start="37.44" dur="3.45">economic collapse news brief for this</text>
  <text start="39.149" dur="3.151">saturday let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="40.89" dur="4.559">economic collapse news and what do we</text>
  <text start="42.3" dur="7.14">know well we understand that the United</text>
  <text start="45.449" dur="7.5">States eurozone Australia each one of</text>
  <text start="49.44" dur="7.099">these countries is piling on debt and as</text>
  <text start="52.949" dur="6.18">they continually pile on debt their</text>
  <text start="56.539" dur="4.691">revenue that they bring in cannot</text>
  <text start="59.129" dur="3.96">sustain the debt load that they have and</text>
  <text start="61.23" dur="3.719">of course many of the countries are</text>
  <text start="63.089" dur="3.421">implementing austerity where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="3.421">laying off people and when you lay off</text>
  <text start="66.51" dur="4.71">people they&amp;#39;re not making an income and</text>
  <text start="68.37" dur="5.039">they can&amp;#39;t contribute to the</text>
  <text start="71.22" dur="3.99">government&amp;#39;s revenue and this makes it</text>
  <text start="73.409" dur="3.721">harder for the government to make the</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="4.89">payments on the debt so it really</text>
  <text start="77.13" dur="4.349">becomes unsustainable that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="4.229">what normally happens but the United</text>
  <text start="81.479" dur="4.471">States they have a printing press so the</text>
  <text start="84.329" dur="4.951">government continually borrows and right</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="5.25">now the government suspended the debt</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="4.229">ceiling so right now the government has</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="4.26">the ability to spend whatever they want</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="4.981">and they&amp;#39;ll keep doing this and as they</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="5.85">keep spending and borrowing from the Fed</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="5.519">to pay for all the social programs to</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="6.9">pay for the interest on the debt this</text>
  <text start="104.009" dur="7.441">debt is going to rise very very quickly</text>
  <text start="108.21" dur="4.74">and they are looking for ways to bring</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="3.209">in revenue and this is why they have</text>
  <text start="112.95" dur="4.459">fact that where they&amp;#39;re going across to</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="5.49">all different other nations looking for</text>
  <text start="117.409" dur="4.63">Americans who are making money to bring</text>
  <text start="120.149" dur="3.9">in revenue to the United States even if</text>
  <text start="122.039" dur="4.351">you have a passport in the United States</text>
  <text start="124.049" dur="4.801">but you&amp;#39;re working overseas they still</text>
  <text start="126.39" dur="3.96">want to tax you money they want to look</text>
  <text start="128.85" dur="4.92">in the bank accounts that are overseas</text>
  <text start="130.35" dur="5.49">tax that money and if you decide you</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="3.9">want to leave the United States there is</text>
  <text start="135.84" dur="4.54">a bill right now where they would like</text>
  <text start="137.67" dur="3.97">to take thirty percent of your wealth</text>
  <text start="140.38" dur="2.79">for you leave the United States so</text>
  <text start="141.64" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re looking everywhere for revenue</text>
  <text start="143.17" dur="4.59">they tried with Obamacare and of course</text>
  <text start="146.59" dur="2.34">they put it out there that everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.76" dur="3.06">going to get health insurance so</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="4.68">everyone can be healthy it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="150.82" dur="5.58">matter but what they really did was they</text>
  <text start="153.61" dur="4.98">talked to the insurance companies they</text>
  <text start="156.4" dur="4.56">raised the premium so everyone can be</text>
  <text start="158.59" dur="4.2">involved they raised the deductibles so</text>
  <text start="160.96" dur="4.02">most of the people won&amp;#39;t even use their</text>
  <text start="162.79" dur="4.02">health insurance during that year</text>
  <text start="164.98" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;ll just be paying premiums and they</text>
  <text start="166.81" dur="4.71">were hoping that the youth of America</text>
  <text start="169.09" dur="4.95">would just pay for their health</text>
  <text start="171.52" dur="4.08">insurance but as you know most people</text>
  <text start="174.04" dur="3.75">are healthy at when you&amp;#39;re younger and</text>
  <text start="175.6" dur="3.54">they wouldn&amp;#39;t actually use their health</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="3.03">insurance because they have a huge</text>
  <text start="179.14" dur="3.45">deductible maybe they go to the doctor</text>
  <text start="180.82" dur="3.06">once or twice but they would never reach</text>
  <text start="182.59" dur="3.9">their deductible and they would just be</text>
  <text start="183.88" dur="3.84">paying in with their premiums well this</text>
  <text start="186.49" dur="3.39">isn&amp;#39;t happening and there are many</text>
  <text start="187.72" dur="4.2">hidden taxes within Obamacare and also</text>
  <text start="189.88" dur="4.29">there are penalties if you do not take</text>
  <text start="191.92" dur="4.44">Obamacare so this isn&amp;#39;t really happening</text>
  <text start="194.17" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re not getting the response they</text>
  <text start="196.36" dur="3.24">wanted they&amp;#39;re not getting the income</text>
  <text start="197.86" dur="3.6">they thought they were going to get so</text>
  <text start="199.6" dur="4.26">now they&amp;#39;re going down a different route</text>
  <text start="201.46" dur="5.91">and this has to do with climate change</text>
  <text start="203.86" dur="5.25">and the whole purpose for the the</text>
  <text start="207.37" dur="4.05">government&amp;#39;s coming out there saying</text>
  <text start="209.11" dur="4.68">that you know we have a climate change</text>
  <text start="211.42" dur="4.08">problem things are really bad this is</text>
  <text start="213.79" dur="3.24">why you see snow which is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="215.5" dur="3.06">this is why you see droughts this is why</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="3.48">you see this it all has to do with</text>
  <text start="218.56" dur="4.38">climate change but really what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="220.51" dur="7.17">setting up for is they&amp;#39;re setting it up</text>
  <text start="222.94" dur="6.09">to tax us they&amp;#39;re going to tax on pretty</text>
  <text start="227.68" dur="3.51">much everything it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="229.03" dur="3.87">carbon tax they&amp;#39;re going to tax you on</text>
  <text start="231.19" dur="3.87">how many miles you drive to work they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="3.93">going to tax you on how much energy you</text>
  <text start="235.06" dur="4.05">use in your houses way to have the smart</text>
  <text start="236.83" dur="4.44">meters they can monitor everything so if</text>
  <text start="239.11" dur="4.14">you use more energy than someone else</text>
  <text start="241.27" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;ll be taxed more and they&amp;#39;ll look</text>
  <text start="243.25" dur="3.93">around and they&amp;#39;ll just add these taxes</text>
  <text start="245.92" dur="3.81">up and this is what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="4.73">now Obama went to California to talk</text>
  <text start="249.73" dur="5.01">about the drought and climate change and</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="6.19">basically what has happened is the White</text>
  <text start="254.74" dur="5.91">House Science assistant John Holdren</text>
  <text start="258.1" dur="4.56">came out and said whether practically</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="4.38">everywhere is being caused by climate</text>
  <text start="262.66" dur="5.07">change which is pretty much absolutely</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="6.21">ridiculous and but they&amp;#39;re building this</text>
  <text start="267.73" dur="6.45">up and again we have to look at what</text>
  <text start="271.24" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re actually doing bringing in</text>
  <text start="274.18" dur="3.209">tax money into the government you know</text>
  <text start="275.74" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re not going to use this for</text>
  <text start="277.389" dur="3.481">anything that has to do with the climate</text>
  <text start="278.74" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re going to use it to pay the debt</text>
  <text start="280.87" dur="5.73">on because of the debt that the</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="3.63">government is continually accumulating</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re going to use this money to pay</text>
  <text start="288.37" dur="3.389">for the social programs going to use</text>
  <text start="289.81" dur="3.75">this money to pay for the wars and give</text>
  <text start="291.759" dur="4.171">aid to other countries this is really</text>
  <text start="293.56" dur="4.229">what it is because they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="295.93" dur="3.42">revenue right now from the American</text>
  <text start="297.789" dur="4.021">people because the American people are</text>
  <text start="299.35" dur="4.89">unemployed and underemployed and that</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="5.49">money is just not coming in is just not</text>
  <text start="304.24" dur="4.98">enough and right now as part of the</text>
  <text start="307.3" dur="4.2">administration&amp;#39;s broad effort to fight</text>
  <text start="309.22" dur="5.58">global warming President Obama will</text>
  <text start="311.5" dur="6.599">propose in 2015 budget a new 1 billion</text>
  <text start="314.8" dur="5.19">dollar climate resilience fund what</text>
  <text start="318.099" dur="4.561">they&amp;#39;re setting up for right now is</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re setting it up so they can tax</text>
  <text start="322.66" dur="5.16">every single person this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="4.829">going to end up doing they want your</text>
  <text start="327.82" dur="4.439">money and they&amp;#39;re going to do it any way</text>
  <text start="330.009" dur="4.231">they can again they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="332.259" dur="4.231">prop up the system as long as they</text>
  <text start="334.24" dur="4.109">possibly can they don&amp;#39;t want the system</text>
  <text start="336.49" dur="3.84">to die why because they are making</text>
  <text start="338.349" dur="4.111">millions and millions of dollars from</text>
  <text start="340.33" dur="3.69">everyone right now they&amp;#39;re making a</text>
  <text start="342.46" dur="3.42">fortune in the market but they</text>
  <text start="344.02" dur="4.889">understand that they only have a certain</text>
  <text start="345.88" dur="5.819">time frame where they can keep this</text>
  <text start="348.909" dur="4.32">going because realistically they need to</text>
  <text start="351.699" dur="2.881">bring in more revenue within united</text>
  <text start="353.229" dur="3.451">states they have to look around the</text>
  <text start="354.58" dur="4.14">world to bring more revenue in and they</text>
  <text start="356.68" dur="3.81">realize and they&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="358.72" dur="3.78">that it&amp;#39;s just not out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="4.08">not bringing it up bringing enough in</text>
  <text start="362.5" dur="4.199">and they&amp;#39;re going to try to do</text>
  <text start="364.57" dur="3.689">everything they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="366.699" dur="3.9">this system going and this is why</text>
  <text start="368.259" dur="6.211">they&amp;#39;re out in the Middle East in Africa</text>
  <text start="370.599" dur="6.121">in the Ukraine in Bosnia in Thailand in</text>
  <text start="374.47" dur="4.979">many other places trying to keep the</text>
  <text start="376.72" dur="4.5">Empire of the United States continually</text>
  <text start="379.449" dur="4.141">going and of course this is the central</text>
  <text start="381.22" dur="3.449">bankers also where they control pretty</text>
  <text start="383.59" dur="2.49">much everything and you can call them</text>
  <text start="384.669" dur="3.981">the globalist e whatever you like to</text>
  <text start="386.08" dur="7.29">call them and this is why they are</text>
  <text start="388.65" dur="7">trying to get into Syria and into Iran</text>
  <text start="393.37" dur="4.229">and they&amp;#39;re trying to get into the</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="5.28">Ukraine they&amp;#39;re trying to get Bosnian to</text>
  <text start="397.599" dur="5.79">join up to the EU and they are</text>
  <text start="400.93" dur="3.9">continually doing this to prop the</text>
  <text start="403.389" dur="3.481">dollar because if they can get into</text>
  <text start="404.83" dur="3">these countries they can spread the dead</text>
  <text start="406.87" dur="3.48">out and if</text>
  <text start="407.83" dur="4.92">two more US dollars to keep the system</text>
  <text start="410.35" dur="5.52">going and this was their plan all along</text>
  <text start="412.75" dur="5.46">this is why they went into Iraq Lebanon</text>
  <text start="415.87" dur="3.96">Libya this is why they&amp;#39;re in the Sudan</text>
  <text start="418.21" dur="3.81">this is why and there&amp;#39;s other reasons</text>
  <text start="419.83" dur="3.93">which I discussed my other reports this</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="4.02">is why they&amp;#39;re in Malley this is why</text>
  <text start="423.76" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;re in central Africa this is why</text>
  <text start="426.04" dur="7.26">they are in all of these places and the</text>
  <text start="430.96" dur="5.19">whole idea of this resilient this</text>
  <text start="433.3" dur="5.4">climate resilience fund the idea of it</text>
  <text start="436.15" dur="4.29">is is something that should be and we</text>
  <text start="438.7" dur="3.93">expect will be supported across all</text>
  <text start="440.44" dur="4.47">parts of the country it is the need to</text>
  <text start="442.63" dur="4.11">be prepared the need to take steps that</text>
  <text start="444.91" dur="3.87">help our farmers and businesses and</text>
  <text start="446.74" dur="4.65">communities deal with consequences from</text>
  <text start="448.78" dur="4.65">severe weather events is evident to</text>
  <text start="451.39" dur="3.33">everyone across the country and of</text>
  <text start="453.43" dur="3.39">course they&amp;#39;re playing this up saying</text>

  <text start="456.82" dur="4.32">have to be prepared we have to help the</text>
  <text start="458.29" dur="5.34">farmers but this is all bs and this is</text>
  <text start="461.14" dur="4.35">all them sugarcoating it so they can tax</text>
  <text start="463.63" dur="3.69">every single person and that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="465.49" dur="4.29">what it comes down to they just want the</text>
  <text start="467.32" dur="4.05">money but they have to let everyone know</text>
  <text start="469.78" dur="6.15">this is why they&amp;#39;re really doing it</text>
  <text start="471.37" dur="7.65">which is absolutely false okay now we</text>
  <text start="475.93" dur="6.15">all understand that the United States is</text>

  <text start="526.57" dur="4.08">that the leader of North Korea has</text>
  <text start="528.43" dur="5">committed and we&amp;#39;ve seen it on the news</text>
  <text start="530.65" dur="6.12">I don&amp;#39;t know how much how true they are</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="7.57">but the UN has not yet confirmed the</text>
  <text start="536.77" dur="4.99">reports accuracy but North Korea&amp;#39;s UN</text>
  <text start="541" dur="2.77">mission in</text>
  <text start="541.76" dur="4.74">York has rejected the reports finding</text>
  <text start="543.77" dur="5.6">and in a US official speaking</text>
  <text start="546.5" dur="5.43">anonymously of course as they always do</text>
  <text start="549.37" dur="4.75">also said that they believe that this</text>
  <text start="551.93" dur="4.26">report is true and of course they do</text>
  <text start="554.12" dur="5.13">because they believe the one against</text>
  <text start="556.19" dur="5.22">Assad is true they believe every single</text>
  <text start="559.25" dur="7.05">report that they issue is true because</text>
  <text start="561.41" dur="8.16">their whole goal their whole entire goal</text>
  <text start="566.3" dur="5.64">has always remained the same to get into</text>
  <text start="569.57" dur="4.5">these countries they don&amp;#39;t care if they</text>
  <text start="571.94" dur="5.52">can get into them they will replace the</text>
  <text start="574.07" dur="5.61">leader and put a puppet regime in there</text>
  <text start="577.46" dur="5.1">and then start using the US dollar as</text>
  <text start="579.68" dur="5.22">the main currency make loans out within</text>
  <text start="582.56" dur="4.77">the country establish a private western</text>

  <text start="649.88" dur="4.86">even further and this is the whole game</text>
  <text start="652.64" dur="5.09">plan that they have here and they</text>
  <text start="654.74" dur="6.15">understand there will be a time when</text>
  <text start="657.73" dur="4.78">they can&amp;#39;t push this anymore and war</text>
  <text start="660.89" dur="3.09">will break out because things will start</text>
  <text start="662.51" dur="3.81">to collapse and I believe we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="663.98" dur="5.13">to see a little bit of this now with the</text>
  <text start="666.32" dur="4.56">stock market going up and down and the</text>
  <text start="669.11" dur="4.38">way they&amp;#39;re trying to continually push</text>
  <text start="670.88" dur="3.9">in every single location and more more</text>
  <text start="673.49" dur="4.56">countries are being added</text>
  <text start="674.78" dur="5.31">on where where the United States is</text>
  <text start="678.05" dur="4.35">bringing more and more troops into these</text>
  <text start="680.09" dur="4.68">areas just to maintain what we have and</text>
  <text start="682.4" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s getting much more difficult as time</text>
  <text start="684.77" dur="6.41">goes on and as we can see we have the</text>
  <text start="688.4" dur="6">pivot pivot to Asia they are bringing</text>
  <text start="691.18" dur="6.19">military assets the age to the Asian</text>
  <text start="694.4" dur="5.79">region and we can see Japan is trying to</text>
  <text start="697.37" dur="4.47">change their constitution article 9 so</text>
  <text start="700.19" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re no longer a pacifist nation</text>
  <text start="701.84" dur="6.18">where they&amp;#39;re able to declare war if</text>
  <text start="703.91" dur="6.15">they need Japan has built a new warship</text>
  <text start="708.02" dur="4.68">and it&amp;#39;s the first warship since world</text>
  <text start="710.06" dur="4.53">war two and the United States is moving</text>
  <text start="712.7" dur="3.9">the base from Okinawa to a new location</text>
  <text start="714.59" dur="5.91">to bring in more sophisticated weapons</text>
  <text start="716.6" dur="5.7">and lo and behold right now Tokyo</text>
  <text start="720.5" dur="4.52">suggests that it would allow you the</text>
  <text start="722.3" dur="5.16">u.s. to bring in a nuclear weapon and</text>
  <text start="725.02" dur="4.48">they&amp;#39;re allowed to bring it into the</text>
  <text start="727.46" dur="5.52">Japanese territory in the event of a</text>
  <text start="729.5" dur="7.44">serious threat to its security so we can</text>
  <text start="732.98" dur="6.06">see what is happening right here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="736.94" dur="5.43">moving the base to a different location</text>
  <text start="739.04" dur="6.03">so they can bring in more sophisticated</text>
  <text start="742.37" dur="5.1">weapons well I would say a nuclear</text>
  <text start="745.07" dur="4.56">weapon is much more sophisticated and</text>
  <text start="747.47" dur="4.44">they realize they are setting all this</text>
  <text start="749.63" dur="4.2">up because they they need all these</text>
  <text start="751.91" dur="3.63">weapons and these military assets in</text>
  <text start="753.83" dur="4.65">certain locations because they</text>
  <text start="755.54" dur="5.7">understand when world war three starts</text>
  <text start="758.48" dur="4.47">they will need everything positioned and</text>
  <text start="761.24" dur="3.15">this is why I talked about yesterday we</text>
  <text start="762.95" dur="3.6">were in our united states central</text>
  <text start="764.39" dur="4.56">bankers are in africa because they</text>
  <text start="766.55" dur="5.13">realize the raw materials they need to</text>
  <text start="768.95" dur="6.69">build weapons electronics to build ships</text>
  <text start="771.68" dur="5.7">are in in africa and they&amp;#39;ll no longer</text>
  <text start="775.64" dur="3.99">be able to get these raw materials from</text>
  <text start="777.38" dur="3.51">china and russia and there&amp;#39;s many other</text>
  <text start="779.63" dur="3.69">reasons why they&amp;#39;re in Africa but that</text>
  <text start="780.89" dur="3.63">was the one I mentioned yesterday in the</text>
  <text start="783.32" dur="3.81">report and if you like to go back you</text>
  <text start="784.52" dur="6.99">can take a listen to that 2 3 episode 2</text>
  <text start="787.13" dur="6.09">90 now Kerry went on to say that the</text>
  <text start="791.51" dur="3.93">United States neither recognizes nor</text>
  <text start="793.22" dur="5.07">accept China&amp;#39;s declared east china sea</text>
  <text start="795.44" dur="4.98">air defense zone and the United States</text>
  <text start="798.29" dur="4.47">has no intention of changing how we</text>
  <text start="800.42" dur="3.84">conduct operations in the region we are</text>
  <text start="802.76" dur="3.18">deeply committed to maintaining the</text>
  <text start="804.26" dur="4.17">prosperity and the stability in the</text>
  <text start="805.94" dur="3.24">Asian Pacific area and that won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="808.43" dur="2.19">possible with</text>
  <text start="809.18" dur="3.36">that respect for international law</text>
  <text start="810.62" dur="3.48">including freedom of navigation and</text>
  <text start="812.54" dur="3">overflight so they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="814.1" dur="4.74">continually provoked China and</text>
  <text start="815.54" dur="5.79">eventually something will occur down the</text>
  <text start="818.84" dur="5.85">line and we can see that eventually as</text>
  <text start="821.33" dur="5.19">things heat up something will happen war</text>
  <text start="824.69" dur="4.14">will start I mean right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="826.52" dur="4.35">looking at Syria we&amp;#39;re looking at Iran</text>
  <text start="828.83" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re looking at the Ukraine where</text>
  <text start="830.87" dur="7.74">there&amp;#39;s many different hotspots where</text>
  <text start="833.54" dur="7.32">something could break out now when we</text>
  <text start="838.61" dur="4.41">look at Syria we see that Geneva 2 talks</text>
  <text start="840.86" dur="4.86">have gone absolutely nowhere because the</text>
  <text start="843.02" dur="4.68">whole again the whole agenda was to</text>
  <text start="845.72" dur="3.42">remove Assad put a transitional</text>
  <text start="847.7" dur="3.69">government in there and right now the</text>
  <text start="849.14" dur="3.72">opposition leaders these are the paid</text>
  <text start="851.39" dur="4.32">mercenaries of the United States</text>
  <text start="852.86" dur="4.41">government have said that there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="855.71" dur="3.75">reason for us to even come back to the</text>
  <text start="857.27" dur="4.29">talks because you guys don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="859.46" dur="4.17">talk about the transition of the</text>
  <text start="861.56" dur="4.17">government so right now pretty much the</text>
  <text start="863.63" dur="4.95">opposition is completely out but the</text>
  <text start="865.73" dur="5.61">president is out there saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="868.58" dur="4.53">going to consider further steps to put</text>
  <text start="871.34" dur="5.52">pressure on the regime of the President</text>
  <text start="873.11" dur="5.52">President Assad in Syria and Obama said</text>
  <text start="876.86" dur="4.08">that both leaders recognize that we</text>
  <text start="878.63" dur="5.13">can&amp;#39;t just treat the symptoms of the</text>
  <text start="880.94" dur="4.68">crisis we also have to we&amp;#39;re also going</text>
  <text start="883.76" dur="5.61">to have to solve the underlying problem</text>
  <text start="885.62" dur="6.84">and that is a regime led by Assad needs</text>
  <text start="889.37" dur="5.91">to be removed and we can see this is the</text>
  <text start="892.46" dur="4.56">agenda all along it was the agenda back</text>
  <text start="895.28" dur="4.5">in August when they did the false flag</text>
  <text start="897.02" dur="5.22">event it is still the agenda now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="899.78" dur="5.4">the same agenda in Iran it&amp;#39;s just being</text>
  <text start="902.24" dur="5.43">masked by these nuclear peace talks but</text>
  <text start="905.18" dur="5.19">while everyone&amp;#39;s looking at the nuclear</text>
  <text start="907.67" dur="6.24">peace talks in the background we have</text>
  <text start="910.37" dur="6.12">the IMF infiltrating the banks of Iran</text>
  <text start="913.91" dur="4.53">trying to set interest rates we also</text>
  <text start="916.49" dur="6.84">have Russia in there making deals with</text>
  <text start="918.44" dur="7.71">Iran on their economic status and trying</text>
  <text start="923.33" dur="5.13">to create deals and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="926.15" dur="5.4">who gets in and infiltrates the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928.46" dur="5.49">first and if the IMF the central bankers</text>
  <text start="931.55" dur="5.91">cannot get in there and put the natural</text>
  <text start="933.95" dur="5.58">resources on the US dollar this deal</text>
  <text start="937.46" dur="5.8">will completely fall apart and we have</text>
  <text start="939.53" dur="9.29">to remember this p p5 plus 12</text>
  <text start="943.26" dur="8.71">is mass in secrecy because right now the</text>
  <text start="948.82" dur="5.52">document is unclassified but you cannot</text>
  <text start="951.97" dur="3.9">just look at it you need to sign in you</text>
  <text start="954.34" dur="2.91">have to have certain clearances you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="955.87" dur="4.23">not allowed to copy now how to bring</text>
  <text start="957.25" dur="5.94">your phone in there and we can see that</text>
  <text start="960.1" dur="5.55">something else is going on but when this</text>
  <text start="963.19" dur="4.89">whole thing goes south we can see that</text>
  <text start="965.65" dur="5.82">things will change very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="968.08" dur="5.13">again the goal is always the same they</text>
  <text start="971.47" dur="4.08">would like to change the government and</text>
  <text start="973.21" dur="4.32">put it in a puppet regime but in Iran</text>
  <text start="975.55" dur="4.2">situation they&amp;#39;re trying to infiltrate</text>
  <text start="977.53" dur="5.7">the banks to put their natural resources</text>
  <text start="979.75" dur="4.8">on the US dollar as the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="983.23" dur="6.33">and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how that goes out</text>
  <text start="984.55" dur="7.38">as time goes on but with Syria what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="989.56" dur="4.59">happening there is they were trying all</text>
  <text start="991.93" dur="5.7">different ways of getting in there to</text>
  <text start="994.15" dur="5.22">remove Assad they&amp;#39;ve tried going through</text>
  <text start="997.63" dur="3.57">the war crime thing this is why the</text>
  <text start="999.37" dur="3.33">propaganda about war crimes is being</text>
  <text start="1001.2" dur="3.54">built up and they had these reports but</text>
  <text start="1002.7" dur="4.2">there was no proof right before the</text>
  <text start="1004.74" dur="4.77">Geneva 2 talks they tried to say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1006.9" dur="5.79">going in for a humanitarian aid and they</text>
  <text start="1009.51" dur="5.58">had a draft of a UN resolution that said</text>
  <text start="1012.69" dur="4.35">Assad committed war crimes that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="1015.09" dur="4.23">need to go in for a humanitarian aid and</text>
  <text start="1017.04" dur="4.62">Russia said absolutely not if we sign</text>
  <text start="1019.32" dur="3.75">this this shows that Assad has committed</text>
  <text start="1021.66" dur="3.48">war crimes and there&amp;#39;s no proof of that</text>
  <text start="1023.07" dur="4.139">and this was and they said they would</text>
  <text start="1025.14" dur="4.05">veto this and of course this was shot</text>
  <text start="1027.209" dur="4.5">down and that didn&amp;#39;t go any further but</text>
  <text start="1029.19" dur="6.03">we have to remember the United States</text>
  <text start="1031.709" dur="6.511">Saudi Arabia Israel has paid these</text>
  <text start="1035.22" dur="6.39">mercenaries to go into Syria and to</text>
  <text start="1038.22" dur="6.989">cause this destruction and we paid these</text>
  <text start="1041.61" dur="5.52">people to do this now the United States</text>
  <text start="1045.209" dur="4.081">okay the United States paid for this and</text>
  <text start="1047.13" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re paying for this war now the</text>
  <text start="1049.29" dur="5.97">United States is also paying for the</text>
  <text start="1051.99" dur="5.43">humanitarian aid of 1.7 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="1055.26" dur="4.11">so we paid billions upon billions of</text>
  <text start="1057.42" dur="3.27">dollars to create this mess and now</text>
  <text start="1059.37" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re paying billions and billions of</text>
  <text start="1060.69" dur="6.87">dollars to help the people that this</text>
  <text start="1063.27" dur="7.68">mess is hurting so and this is all for</text>
  <text start="1067.56" dur="5.73">to remove Assad to put the US dollar as</text>
  <text start="1070.95" dur="4.68">the reserve currency and to put a puppet</text>
  <text start="1073.29" dur="3.53">regime in Syria and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1075.63" dur="5.69">happening right there</text>
  <text start="1076.82" dur="7.199">so Saudi Arabia has decided to give the</text>
  <text start="1081.32" dur="5.4">Syrian rebels anti-aircraft missiles and</text>
  <text start="1084.019" dur="5.01">this is in preparation for a new strike</text>

  <text start="1104.63" dur="3.629">didn&amp;#39;t work and this is why we saw the</text>

  <text start="1187.07" dur="4.349">see more propaganda and we will have</text>
  <text start="1189.23" dur="4.77">some type of an event here and Saudi</text>
  <text start="1191.419" dur="6.36">Arabia right now is helping out and</text>
  <text start="1194" dur="5.879">supplying the rebels out there with more</text>
  <text start="1197.779" dur="3.36">weapons United States has sent weapons</text>
  <text start="1199.879" dur="3.571">of course Congress did this behind</text>
  <text start="1201.139" dur="7.051">closed doors in secrecy and passed a</text>
  <text start="1203.45" dur="7.02">bill where they allowed aid to to pass</text>
  <text start="1208.19" dur="5.609">and they are sending weapons which are</text>
  <text start="1210.47" dur="6.089">already arrived in Syria to help the</text>
  <text start="1213.799" dur="4.351">rebels overthrow Assad and again this</text>
  <text start="1216.559" dur="4.021">battle has been going on for almost</text>
  <text start="1218.15" dur="4.8">three years now and it has gone nowhere</text>
  <text start="1220.58" dur="3.81">and this is why they have to take it to</text>
  <text start="1222.95" dur="2.849">the next step this is why they took it</text>
  <text start="1224.39" dur="4.73">to the next step in August that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1225.799" dur="6.781">work out and they&amp;#39;re going to try again</text>
  <text start="1229.12" dur="5.2">now the national cybersecurity and</text>
  <text start="1232.58" dur="5.04">critical infrastructure protection act</text>
  <text start="1234.32" dur="5.25">HR 3696 was introduced in Congress as</text>
  <text start="1237.62" dur="3.35">the power grid attacks of 2013 finely</text>
  <text start="1239.57" dur="4.05">filtered into the American consciousness</text>
  <text start="1240.97" dur="4.42">the cybersecurity legislation is</text>
  <text start="1243.62" dur="3.51">supposed to allow communications</text>
  <text start="1245.39" dur="3.39">integration centers within the</text>
  <text start="1247.13" dur="4.49">Department of Homeland Security to offer</text>
  <text start="1248.78" dur="6.93">real-time cyber threat information and</text>
  <text start="1251.62" dur="6.929">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is DHS is</text>
  <text start="1255.71" dur="5.67">pretty much taking over all cyber</text>
  <text start="1258.549" dur="5.801">activity they&amp;#39;re the ones who are going</text>
  <text start="1261.38" dur="5.25">to protect the US from these cyber</text>
  <text start="1264.35" dur="4.5">attacks and again this allows them to</text>
  <text start="1266.63" dur="6.39">have full control because they&amp;#39;ll need</text>
  <text start="1268.85" dur="6.9">full control when depending on which</text>
  <text start="1273.02" dur="4.74">agency commits the cyber attack on the</text>
  <text start="1275.75" dur="6.929">United States and this way no other</text>
  <text start="1277.76" dur="7.289">agency no other force can report what is</text>
  <text start="1282.679" dur="5.041">actually happening because DHS is in</text>
  <text start="1285.049" dur="5.641">complete control of what is going on but</text>
  <text start="1287.72" dur="4.41">on februari 11th cyber hackers exploited</text>
  <text start="1290.69" dur="4.25">the weakness of the network Time</text>
  <text start="1292.13" dur="5.73">Protocol system that keeps most of the</text>
  <text start="1294.94" dur="5.71">computers with windows and many servers</text>
  <text start="1297.86" dur="6">all sink their time up from a central</text>
  <text start="1300.65" dur="7.009">location and apparently the network Time</text>
  <text start="1303.86" dur="7.11">Protocol system was a cyberattack and</text>
  <text start="1307.659" dur="5.231">again not knowing what time it is was</text>
  <text start="1310.97" dur="4.62">not the downside of the successful hack</text>
  <text start="1312.89" dur="4.71">the cyber terrorists were able to send a</text>
  <text start="1315.59" dur="4.319">massive amount of data to servers which</text>
  <text start="1317.6" dur="5.16">could introduce malicious attack on</text>
  <text start="1319.909" dur="5.64">online networks and we can see the cyber</text>
  <text start="1322.76" dur="4.62">attacks are ramping up now because they</text>
  <text start="1325.549" dur="4.591">need the American people to understand</text>
  <text start="1327.38" dur="5.88">that these attacks are dangerous they</text>
  <text start="1330.14" dur="5.94">can take out the power grid they could</text>
  <text start="1333.26" dur="4.98">take out financial institutions they can</text>
  <text start="1336.08" dur="4.709">steal your information because when the</text>
  <text start="1338.24" dur="4.48">Doomsday cyber attack hits they need</text>
  <text start="1340.789" dur="4.721">everyone to understand</text>
  <text start="1342.72" dur="4.89">that this hurt the economy it brought</text>
  <text start="1345.51" dur="4.44">the financial institutions to its knees</text>
  <text start="1347.61" dur="4.17">and this was all because of Syria</text>
  <text start="1349.95" dur="3.18">because of North Korea because of China</text>
  <text start="1351.78" dur="4.23">depending on the nations that they</text>
  <text start="1353.13" dur="7.35">choose to do this with and now there is</text>
  <text start="1356.01" dur="7.44">propaganda out there again with North</text>
  <text start="1360.48" dur="5.819">Korea about cyberattacks and again they</text>
  <text start="1363.45" dur="5.49">have the UN report going and being</text>
  <text start="1366.299" dur="5.041">discussed about war crimes against North</text>
  <text start="1368.94" dur="4.44">Korea and now North Korea&amp;#39;s effort to</text>
  <text start="1371.34" dur="3.719">build a cyber army that can conduct a</text>
  <text start="1373.38" dur="4.62">string of attacks on neighboring states</text>
  <text start="1375.059" dur="5.341">has experts asking some key questions is</text>
  <text start="1378" dur="4.799">North Korea gearing up for a cyber</text>
  <text start="1380.4" dur="4.13">assault on the United States and again</text>
  <text start="1382.799" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re building this propaganda</text>
  <text start="1384.53" dur="6.34">completely up and this goes on to say we</text>
  <text start="1387.539" dur="5.281">should never underestimate North Korea&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1390.87" dur="4.02">willingness to engage in dangerous and</text>
  <text start="1392.82" dur="4.71">provocative behavior to extract more aid</text>
  <text start="1394.89" dur="3.6">and concessions from the international</text>
  <text start="1397.53" dur="3.09">community and this is from</text>
  <text start="1398.49" dur="3.569">Representative Mike Rogers he is the</text>
  <text start="1400.62" dur="4.08">chairman of the House Select Committee</text>
  <text start="1402.059" dur="4.291">on Intelligence and this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="1404.7" dur="3.24">that they are saying quite publicly they</text>
  <text start="1406.35" dur="4.079">have several thousands men and women</text>
  <text start="1407.94" dur="5.849">working on a daily basis on cyber</text>
  <text start="1410.429" dur="6.901">attacks and again we have to remember</text>
  <text start="1413.789" dur="5.311">that Mike Rogers has his sista bill</text>
  <text start="1417.33" dur="4.56">pending right now in the Senate that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1419.1" dur="5.52">passed the house but it is pending in</text>
  <text start="1421.89" dur="4.169">the Senate and Roger still hopes to see</text>
  <text start="1424.62" dur="4.32">the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and</text>
  <text start="1426.059" dur="4.791">protection act which has passed the</text>
  <text start="1428.94" dur="4.29">house and now pending in the Senate and</text>
  <text start="1430.85" dur="3.939">what it will do it will allow greater</text>
  <text start="1433.23" dur="3.51">information sharing between the</text>
  <text start="1434.789" dur="4.201">government and private companies to</text>
  <text start="1436.74" dur="4.02">prevent and respond to cyberattacks but</text>
  <text start="1438.99" dur="3.45">critics say it will give the government</text>
  <text start="1440.76" dur="4.649">greater ability to monitor students</text>
  <text start="1442.44" dur="5.849">citizens internet communications and to</text>
  <text start="1445.409" dur="6.291">have full control of the Internet now we</text>
  <text start="1448.289" dur="8.671">have to remember that the president just</text>
  <text start="1451.7" dur="9.42">signed a new cyber infrastructure type</text>
  <text start="1456.96" dur="6.719">of law which is now voluntary for</text>
  <text start="1461.12" dur="5.62">companies will volunteer their</text>
  <text start="1463.679" dur="5.401">information to the government now we</text>
  <text start="1466.74" dur="4.95">have to think back the president</text>
  <text start="1469.08" dur="5.13">actually said that he would veto the SIS</text>
  <text start="1471.69" dur="3.35">/ bill if it came to his desk but he</text>
  <text start="1474.21" dur="5.23">went ahead</text>
  <text start="1475.04" dur="7.89">and he created this infrastructure</text>
  <text start="1479.44" dur="5.71">executive order and he&amp;#39;s saying that it</text>
  <text start="1482.93" dur="4.38">is now voluntary for all businesses to</text>
  <text start="1485.15" dur="4.17">share their information and sis but</text>
  <text start="1487.31" dur="4.59">makes it mandatory for them to do this</text>
  <text start="1489.32" dur="5.43">he also created the executive orders to</text>
  <text start="1491.9" dur="6.21">support the cyber security to support</text>
  <text start="1494.75" dur="5.58">sista so how possibly is he going to</text>
  <text start="1498.11" dur="6.21">veto this when everything that he is</text>
  <text start="1500.33" dur="6.06">doing supports sista and again as we see</text>
  <text start="1504.32" dur="4.68">these cyber attacks continuously coming</text>
  <text start="1506.39" dur="6.93">we will eventually see a bigger one</text>
  <text start="1509" dur="7.17">where they&amp;#39;ll say listen it&amp;#39;s come to</text>
  <text start="1513.32" dur="4.8">the point where we need to pass sista we</text>
  <text start="1516.17" dur="3.57">have all the executive orders created we</text>
  <text start="1518.12" dur="3.69">have the infrastructure system which is</text>
  <text start="1519.74" dur="4.35">voluntary right now we should make it</text>
  <text start="1521.81" dur="4.89">mandatory so let&amp;#39;s just pass sista</text>
  <text start="1524.09" dur="4.8">because we have to remember they want to</text>
  <text start="1526.7" dur="4.73">take control of the entire internet and</text>
  <text start="1528.89" dur="5.49">that is what their main objective is and</text>
  <text start="1531.43" dur="4.96">they want control over pretty much</text>
  <text start="1534.38" dur="4.29">everything they don&amp;#39;t like that the</text>
  <text start="1536.39" dur="4.71">internet is like the Wild West free and</text>
  <text start="1538.67" dur="4.68">open because they can they control the</text>
  <text start="1541.1" dur="4.56">money supply they control the corporate</text>
  <text start="1543.35" dur="4.65">media and they need to control the</text>
  <text start="1545.66" dur="3.93">Internet listen everyone thanks a lot</text>
