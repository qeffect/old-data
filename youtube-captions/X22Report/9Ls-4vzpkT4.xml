  <text start="202.15" dur="5.58">without the shackles of the European</text>
  <text start="204.07" dur="8.4">Union we will flourish and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="207.73" dur="7.38">petrifies the EU once we are out they</text>
  <text start="212.47" dur="5.13">will see us flourishing and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="215.11" dur="4.71">scares the hell out of them and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.6" dur="5.13">absolutely right the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.82" dur="5.09">worst nightmare is for a country to</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="4.59">leave their system and to do well</text>
  <text start="224.91" dur="5.2">because that will show the rest of the</text>
  <text start="227.32" dur="5.22">countries around the globe that the</text>
  <text start="230.11" dur="4.379">private western central bank it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="232.54" dur="3.75">help the people it doesn&amp;#39;t help the</text>
  <text start="234.489" dur="4.291">country it doesn&amp;#39;t make people better</text>
  <text start="236.29" dur="3.96">off actually what makes people better</text>
  <text start="238.78" dur="3.959">off and what helps the country is</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="5.01">getting rid of the private Western</text>
  <text start="242.739" dur="5.401">central bank and this is just the</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="4.65">beginning because once this does happen</text>
  <text start="248.14" dur="4.68">I do believe that this is definitely</text>
  <text start="249.91" dur="4.62">going to happen other countries are</text>
  <text start="252.82" dur="5.099">going to look at this and say you know</text>
  <text start="254.53" dur="6.389">something we want what the UK has we</text>
  <text start="257.919" dur="5.041">want what the US has and it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="5.671">spread across the globe this is what the</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="7.11">Patriots are getting ready for and as we</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="6.72">know Trump is already to make deals with</text>
  <text start="270.07" dur="5.55">the UK trade deals where other countries</text>
  <text start="273.31" dur="5.43">would have to go through the UK to trade</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="6.75">with the US it&amp;#39;s a win-win for the UK</text>
  <text start="278.74" dur="6.56">it&amp;#39;s a win-win for the u.s. it&amp;#39;s a lose</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="5.609">for the central bank for the EU system</text>
  <text start="285.3" dur="4.66">now here in the United States what Trump</text>
  <text start="287.979" dur="5.401">of the Patriots are doing they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="289.96" dur="6.34">to push this entire economic system to</text>
  <text start="293.38" dur="4.48">the edge by taking on more and more</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="5.19">now a lot of people say well that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="297.86" dur="5.61">Obama did back in 2008 he took on a lot</text>
  <text start="301.49" dur="3.989">of debt wasn&amp;#39;t he doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="303.47" dur="6.15">no because their plane was a little bit</text>
  <text start="305.479" dur="6.75">different back in 2008 even prior to</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="4.62">this they were planning on running up</text>
  <text start="312.229" dur="4.53">the debt now did this go to the</text>
  <text start="314.24" dur="5.459">infrastructure did this help businesses</text>
  <text start="316.759" dur="5.761">this has helped the people in any way or</text>
  <text start="319.699" dur="5.611">was siphoned off to other areas where</text>
  <text start="322.52" dur="4.739">we&amp;#39;ve never seen it again well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.31" dur="5.579">pretty much what happened because their</text>
  <text start="327.259" dur="8.521">plan was to continually print and print</text>
  <text start="330.889" dur="7.231">and print borrow borrow borrow as much</text>
  <text start="335.78" dur="5.16">as they possibly can have a war cover</text>
  <text start="338.12" dur="5.13">this whole thing up and no one would be</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="4.68">the wiser Trump and the Patriots their</text>
  <text start="343.25" dur="5.94">plan is completely different their plan</text>
  <text start="345.62" dur="8.49">is to use the central bank system to use</text>
  <text start="349.19" dur="8.039">their funny money to rebuild America to</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="6.209">rebuild the infrastructure that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="357.229" dur="4.921">difference and when we look at the u.s.</text>
  <text start="360.319" dur="5.07">total federal debt since the Trump</text>
  <text start="362.15" dur="6.75">election it has increased their doing</text>
  <text start="365.389" dur="6.15">just that we have now passed the 23</text>
  <text start="368.9" dur="5.43">trillion dollar mark doesn&amp;#39;t even matter</text>
  <text start="371.539" dur="6.391">how high we go at this point no because</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="5.25">what&amp;#39;s going to happen in the end Trump</text>
  <text start="377.93" dur="4.049">in the Patriots they&amp;#39;re going to turn</text>
  <text start="379.58" dur="6.059">this all around they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="381.979" dur="5.97">pointing at the Fed they&amp;#39;re gonna want</text>
  <text start="385.639" dur="5.52">an audit they&amp;#39;re gonna show what the</text>
  <text start="387.949" dur="7.5">central banks have been up to all these</text>
  <text start="391.159" dur="7.591">years that is the difference and when we</text>
  <text start="395.449" dur="6.631">look at globalization it has come to a</text>
  <text start="398.75" dur="6.449">screeching halt everything that they</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="7.739">tried to do in the past it has been</text>
  <text start="405.199" dur="8.34">reversed now with the trade wars with</text>
  <text start="409.819" dur="6.981">the tariffs with Trump renegotiating</text>
  <text start="413.539" dur="6.451">trade deals and creating new trade deals</text>
  <text start="416.8" dur="6.7">everything that we&amp;#39;ve seen has been</text>
  <text start="419.99" dur="5.849">reversed and remember what the central</text>
  <text start="423.5" dur="4.06">bank what the deep state was doing they</text>
  <text start="425.839" dur="4.211">were removing manufacturers</text>
  <text start="427.56" dur="5.28">removing everything from the United</text>
  <text start="430.05" dur="7.14">States and it made the United States a</text>
  <text start="432.84" dur="8.07">consumer-based country while the eastern</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="6.69">hemisphere they manufactured goods Trump</text>
  <text start="440.91" dur="5.43">is reversing this this has been the plan</text>
  <text start="443.88" dur="5.46">for quite a while now and you can see</text>
  <text start="446.34" dur="5.7">this is why he&amp;#39;s pushing tariffs so at</text>
  <text start="449.34" dur="3.99">this time everything is being reversed</text>
  <text start="452.04" dur="4.95">and this is why Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="7.17">saying that globalization has no future</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="6.96">the globalists have no future in this</text>
  <text start="460.5" dur="7.639">new economic system now there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="463.95" dur="7.11">talk about how Trump is going to remove</text>
  <text start="468.139" dur="5.201">the Fed Chairman this is Jerome Powell</text>
  <text start="471.06" dur="4.02">and the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="473.34" dur="4.68">to make it trying to make their case</text>
  <text start="475.08" dur="5.91">that Trump is going to try to remove him</text>
  <text start="478.02" dur="4.68">somehow some way and the reason why</text>
  <text start="480.99" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re doing this and the reason why</text>
  <text start="482.7" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re making this claim is that they</text>
  <text start="485.34" dur="6.6">want to blame Trump for something think</text>
  <text start="488.49" dur="5.1">back to the Muller investigation what</text>

  <text start="520.32" dur="3.899">going to remove them he made everyone</text>
  <text start="522.06" dur="4.88">believe this but he never went ahead and</text>
  <text start="524.219" dur="5.641">did it the same thing with Jerome Powell</text>
