  <text start="41.44" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s begun countries are moving away</text>
  <text start="43.9" dur="4.83">from the US dollar by loading up on gold</text>
  <text start="46.45" dur="5.1">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="48.73" dur="5.46">collapse financial news now today we see</text>
  <text start="51.55" dur="5.1">the market is down once again yesterday</text>
  <text start="54.19" dur="4.86">it was up now it&amp;#39;s down and it looks</text>
  <text start="56.65" dur="6.03">like the market is fluctuating and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="59.05" dur="10.26">actually going absolutely nowhere but</text>
  <text start="62.68" dur="9.39">what&amp;#39;s more interesting is that gold it</text>
  <text start="69.31" dur="5.699">is shot back up now they try to suppress</text>
  <text start="72.07" dur="5.82">it twice in the past couple of days my</text>
  <text start="75.009" dur="8.071">gold has shot up once again and this is</text>
  <text start="77.89" dur="6.63">showing us that gold is moving up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="83.08" dur="4.02">trending up now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="84.52" dur="4.23">is Goldman Sachs JP Morgan they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="87.1" dur="4.379">saying that gold is in a bear market</text>
  <text start="88.75" dur="4.08">right now just the other day Goldman was</text>
  <text start="91.479" dur="4.321">saying that you know gold doesn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="92.83" dur="6.66">going down to $1,000 but it looks like</text>
  <text start="95.8" dur="5.4">at this point all the manipulation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="99.49" dur="3.9">just not going to do it so they had a</text>
  <text start="101.2" dur="4.919">reverse cover all their shorts and now</text>
  <text start="103.39" dur="7.289">they&amp;#39;re saying that gold is moving in an</text>
  <text start="106.119" dur="6.39">upward trend very interesting and what</text>
  <text start="110.679" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re going to see is as they lose more</text>
  <text start="112.509" dur="4.5">and more control of the gold market</text>
  <text start="114.459" dur="4.561">because a lot of people are looking this</text>
  <text start="117.009" dur="4.381">situation and saying okay I need to take</text>
  <text start="119.02" dur="4.83">my money out of the market I need to</text>
  <text start="121.39" dur="4.289">protect myself and put it into gold and</text>
  <text start="123.85" dur="4.799">this is what we people are doing at this</text>
  <text start="125.679" dur="5.521">point because people are getting nervous</text>
  <text start="128.649" dur="4.95">and they know gold and silver are a safe</text>
  <text start="131.2" dur="4.32">haven this is why Russia China and many</text>
  <text start="133.599" dur="5.281">other countries have been loading up on</text>
  <text start="135.52" dur="6.15">gold I&amp;#39;m going to talk about that a</text>
  <text start="138.88" dur="6.439">little bit later in this report but</text>
  <text start="141.67" dur="5.97">let&amp;#39;s go to retail at this time now</text>
  <text start="145.319" dur="5.261">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the retail</text>
  <text start="147.64" dur="5.58">market how its contracting and it is</text>
  <text start="150.58" dur="3.81">getting worse and worse as we move</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="3.78">throughout this year just like we</text>
  <text start="154.39" dur="4.439">thought it was going to be Macy&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="157" dur="3.93">now it looks like they&amp;#39;re getting in</text>
  <text start="158.829" dur="5.671">line with JCPenney Sears where the</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="8.4">entire system of their operating</text>
  <text start="164.5" dur="7.52">is just collapsing on each other and the</text>
  <text start="169.33" dur="6.65">reason for all this is that consumers</text>
  <text start="172.02" dur="6.28">they&amp;#39;re not spending their money and</text>
  <text start="175.98" dur="4.42">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="178.3" dur="4.59">Macy&amp;#39;s is slashing its outlook and</text>
  <text start="180.4" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ve cited that it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="182.89" dur="4.2">consumers are not spending they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="184.69" dur="5.13">say the weather they couldn&amp;#39;t say you</text>
  <text start="187.09" dur="4.14">know their stores are not facing east or</text>
  <text start="189.82" dur="2.76">whatever they&amp;#39;re going to use they</text>
  <text start="191.23" dur="3.21">finally how to come out and say it</text>
  <text start="192.58" dur="3.6">listen the people are just not spending</text>
  <text start="194.44" dur="3.72">right now there&amp;#39;s something going on I</text>
  <text start="196.18" dur="4.47">mean it&amp;#39;s very odd that they&amp;#39;d be saying</text>
  <text start="198.16" dur="4.86">this at the time because the Fed the</text>
  <text start="200.65" dur="4.02">president they&amp;#39;re out there telling us</text>
  <text start="203.02" dur="5.52">that the economy is doing absolutely</text>
  <text start="204.67" dur="8.76">fine so again somebody&amp;#39;s lying and their</text>
  <text start="208.54" dur="6.06">sales have plunged by 6.1 percent and it</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="8.279">doesn&amp;#39;t look good</text>
  <text start="214.6" dur="8.85">I mean sales are down revenue is down we</text>
  <text start="221.709" dur="6.661">see wholesale clothing inventory to</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="6.93">sales is skyrocketing and when we look</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="6">at other stores and we mentioned Old</text>
  <text start="230.38" dur="6.18">Navy Banana Republic gap we see other</text>
  <text start="234.37" dur="4.23">stores are going to be reporting their</text>
  <text start="236.56" dur="3.69">earnings coming up very soon fossil</text>
  <text start="238.6" dur="4.109">right now came out and said okay</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="4.29">their sales have declined by 9% year</text>
  <text start="242.709" dur="4.231">over year and we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="5.55">of stores come out and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="246.94" dur="6.06">give us horrific numbers and what this</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="5.76">means is there&amp;#39;s going to be more people</text>
  <text start="253" dur="4.26">going to be laid off now this might not</text>
  <text start="255.85" dur="2.699">show up in the initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="4.8">because you have to remember how they</text>
  <text start="258.549" dur="5.731">calculate this those people that are</text>
  <text start="262.06" dur="5.73">working retail if they&amp;#39;re working under</text>
  <text start="264.28" dur="5.67">25 or 30 hours they&amp;#39;re not getting paid</text>
  <text start="267.79" dur="3.78">a certain number of dollars in each</text>
  <text start="269.95" dur="3.84">state is different they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="271.57" dur="5.61">counted they&amp;#39;re counted as having a full</text>
  <text start="273.79" dur="6.72">time but when they get laid off or the</text>
  <text start="277.18" dur="6.42">store closes they&amp;#39;re not counted as</text>
  <text start="280.51" dur="5.37">losing their job depending on how many</text>
  <text start="283.6" dur="4.59">hours they work and how many dollars</text>
  <text start="285.88" dur="4.5">they make so the whole thing is kind of</text>
  <text start="288.19" dur="4.8">backwards here but we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="290.38" dur="4.38">further contraction in retail we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="4.71">going to see a further contraction in</text>
  <text start="294.76" dur="3.3">the number of people employed and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="297.7" dur="4.32">been</text>
  <text start="298.06" dur="7.109">seeing this up to this point now when we</text>
  <text start="302.02" dur="4.44">look at the entire economy and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="4.591">been looking at this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="5.01">and we can see that the entire economy</text>
  <text start="309.76" dur="4.17">is contracting actually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.47" dur="3.81">accelerating at this point now I&amp;#39;m I</text>
  <text start="313.93" dur="3.959">know there might be people out there</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="5.46">still that don&amp;#39;t believe but for those</text>
  <text start="317.889" dur="6.591">people who really think that the economy</text>
  <text start="320.74" dur="8.04">is doing well I would suggest one thing</text>
  <text start="324.48" dur="7.27">start prepping now that&amp;#39;s my advice to</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="5.57">you yes you can argue all over the place</text>
  <text start="331.75" dur="5.43">do your quotes saying how the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="334.35" dur="5.44">doing perfectly well I believe the</text>
  <text start="337.18" dur="3.95">president but my advice to you from</text>
  <text start="339.79" dur="4.05">everything that I&amp;#39;ve been looking at and</text>
  <text start="341.13" dur="4.66">from what you&amp;#39;ve been seeing all along</text>
  <text start="343.84" dur="4.2">because it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder</text>
  <text start="345.79" dur="4.47">to argue this point that the economy is</text>
  <text start="348.04" dur="4.17">doing well I would start making</text>
  <text start="350.26" dur="3.36">preparations you can do it quietly so</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="4.62">you don&amp;#39;t have to admit that you were</text>
  <text start="353.62" dur="4.5">wrong but I would start doing it and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="356.83" dur="3.45">not doing this because I don&amp;#39;t wish</text>
  <text start="358.12" dur="3.6">anything bad on anyone I would like</text>
  <text start="360.28" dur="4.74">everyone to be prepared and ready for</text>
  <text start="361.72" dur="6.42">this and to weather this storm now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="365.02" dur="5.81">look at some other data here and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.14" dur="6.21">going to show that this economy is</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="5.38">contracting rapidly and we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="374.35" dur="4.83">much time here because they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="5.16">lose control eventually and we know they</text>
  <text start="379.18" dur="4.65">want to bring down the economy on their</text>
  <text start="381.37" dur="4.35">own of course to blame it on others but</text>
  <text start="383.83" dur="3.42">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="385.72" dur="3.39">total business sales</text>
  <text start="387.25" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;ve been declining for therefore</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="4.29">nearly 2 years right now</text>
  <text start="390.34" dur="6.48">and they&amp;#39;re about 15 percent lower than</text>
  <text start="393.4" dur="6.09">they were in 2014 the inventory to sales</text>
  <text start="396.82" dur="4.26">ratio is now back to near where it was</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="4.62">during the depths of the last recession</text>
  <text start="401.08" dur="5.07">what does this mean there&amp;#39;s lots and</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="6.09">lots of unsold stuff just sitting around</text>
  <text start="406.15" dur="7.489">out there and this is a sign of a very</text>
  <text start="410.2" dur="6.18">unhealthy economy corporate earnings</text>
  <text start="413.639" dur="5.951">they have declined for four consecutive</text>
  <text start="416.38" dur="7.349">quarters this never happens outside a</text>
  <text start="419.59" dur="7.8">recession profits for companies listed</text>
  <text start="423.729" dur="4.801">on the SP S&amp;amp;P 500 they are down seven</text>
  <text start="427.39" dur="3.31">point one percent during the first</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="3.43">quarter of 2016</text>
  <text start="430.7" dur="4.92">when you compare them to the same time</text>
  <text start="431.96" dur="7.07">period of last year in April commercial</text>
  <text start="435.62" dur="6.87">bankruptcies were up 32 percent and</text>
  <text start="439.03" dur="7.15">chapter 11 filings were up 67 percent on</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="7.55">a year-over-year basis and we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="446.18" dur="7.68">about rail traffic it is down 11% and</text>
  <text start="450.04" dur="7.59">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="7.49">US economy has lost an astounding</text>
  <text start="457.63" dur="7.06">191,000 mining jobs since 2014</text>

  <text start="464.69" dur="7.26">35 percent more jobs were cut during</text>
  <text start="467.96" dur="6.99">April than they did in March so far this</text>
  <text start="471.95" dur="5.13">year the job cut announcements are</text>
  <text start="474.95" dur="7.17">running a 24 percent above the exact</text>
  <text start="477.08" dur="9.09">period in 2015 the US GDP it only grew</text>
  <text start="482.12" dur="6.42">at point 5 percent in 2016 this was the</text>
  <text start="486.17" dur="5.79">third time in a row that GDP number has</text>
  <text start="488.54" dur="6.39">declined and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="491.96" dur="4.02">is that this economy no matter what the</text>
  <text start="494.93" dur="2.6">president says no matter what</text>
  <text start="495.98" dur="4.77">statistical numbers they throw at us</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="5.05">it&amp;#39;s contracting and it&amp;#39;s contracting</text>
  <text start="500.75" dur="5.19">very very quickly right now the Baltic</text>

  <text start="505.94" dur="8.7">it&amp;#39;s down 15 points and this Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="510.98" dur="6.78">Index we know it&amp;#39;s seasonal but what</text>
  <text start="514.64" dur="5.81">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that every</text>
  <text start="517.76" dur="5.61">time it moves up in these seasonal areas</text>
  <text start="520.45" dur="4.87">it&amp;#39;s not making higher highs actually</text>
  <text start="523.37" dur="5.67">what&amp;#39;s happening is the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="525.32" dur="6.78">is making newer lows and it the trend is</text>
  <text start="529.04" dur="6.12">down and if you look at the bolt dry</text>
  <text start="532.1" dur="6.33">index graph you can see that the trend</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="7.86">is going further and further downward</text>
  <text start="538.43" dur="9.75">and at this point manufacturing is a</text>
  <text start="543.02" dur="10.26">disaster retail is a disaster and we are</text>
  <text start="548.18" dur="7.89">seeing signs that housing is in a state</text>
  <text start="553.28" dur="5.46">where it&amp;#39;s going to start spreading</text>
  <text start="556.07" dur="4.77">across the country where all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="558.74" dur="5.31">people are going to see housing prices</text>

  <text start="569.6" dur="5.94">live and during the worst time of the</text>
  <text start="572.75" dur="5.85">housing crisis there are people trying</text>
  <text start="575.54" dur="10.35">to sell their home and their prices are</text>
  <text start="578.6" dur="10.489">lower during this recovery then back in</text>

  <text start="593.089" dur="4.651">around the country and I&amp;#39;m starting to</text>
  <text start="595.04" dur="4.47">see this all over the place it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="597.74" dur="3.69">to be like a domino effect and I know</text>
  <text start="599.51" dur="4.71">people are going to say well in my area</text>
  <text start="601.43" dur="5.46">everything is fine yes everything was</text>
  <text start="604.22" dur="5.309">fine in many other areas and it took 8</text>
  <text start="606.89" dur="7.65">to 9 months to reach those areas and</text>
  <text start="609.529" dur="8.161">when it reached it it was a complete</text>
  <text start="614.54" dur="5.76">disaster worse than anyone could have</text>
  <text start="617.69" dur="6.48">imagined and that happened in South</text>

  <text start="624.17" dur="7.14">it in California and this time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="627.68" dur="7.64">going to be much worse we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="631.31" dur="7.11">central banks right now and countries</text>
  <text start="635.32" dur="9.91">the demand for gold has renewed</text>
  <text start="638.42" dur="9.03">worldwide now why is this well what</text>
  <text start="645.23" dur="4.349">we&amp;#39;re hearing right now is that</text>
  <text start="647.45" dur="5.19">countries and the central banks of those</text>
  <text start="649.579" dur="5.901">countries they are loading up on gold to</text>
  <text start="652.64" dur="5.67">diversify from the US dollar</text>
  <text start="655.48" dur="5.14">we know the China Russia they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="658.31" dur="6.69">doing it but we&amp;#39;re starting to see many</text>
  <text start="660.62" dur="5.82">nations and what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="665" dur="4.589">they&amp;#39;re taking their US Dollars and</text>
  <text start="666.44" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re trading it in for gold I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="669.589" dur="3.841">like to say purchase because what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="671.42" dur="4.979">doing is you&amp;#39;re taking paper and ink a</text>
