  <text start="93.44" dur="4.679">news now in Greece we see things well</text>
  <text start="96.08" dur="4.649">they&amp;#39;re not going very well out there</text>
  <text start="98.119" dur="6.871">there have been delays and talks between</text>
  <text start="100.729" dur="9.42">Greece and its lenders and it&amp;#39;s brought</text>
  <text start="104.99" dur="7.199">back the ghost of grexit and people in</text>
  <text start="110.149" dur="5.01">this country are looking at the</text>
  <text start="112.189" dur="4.771">situation and they can see that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="115.159" dur="3.301">a huge disagreement between the</text>
  <text start="116.96" dur="5.159">International Monetary Fund and the</text>
  <text start="118.46" dur="6.72">European lenders and grexit bombshells</text>
  <text start="122.119" dur="5.521">while they&amp;#39;re flying around Greece is</text>
  <text start="125.18" dur="6.089">not accepting additional austerity</text>
  <text start="127.64" dur="7.23">measures and the citizens again are</text>
  <text start="131.269" dur="7.321">looking at this saying ok we need to be</text>
  <text start="134.87" dur="8.1">ready and prepared and they feel that</text>
  <text start="138.59" dur="7.35">the economic situation is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="142.97" dur="4.71">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the Greek</text>
  <text start="145.94" dur="5.34">people they&amp;#39;re making a run on the banks</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="6.63">now there are capital controls in effect</text>
  <text start="151.28" dur="5.82">right now but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="154.31" dur="4.25">people are taking out as much as they</text>
  <text start="157.1" dur="5.79">possibly can</text>
  <text start="158.56" dur="7.51">2.5 billion euros left Greek banks in in</text>
  <text start="162.89" dur="4.76">the last 45 days and despite the capital</text>
  <text start="166.07" dur="5.639">controls that allow Greeks withdraw a</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="6.75">maximum of 1,800 euros per month it</text>
  <text start="171.709" dur="6.541">looks like people are continually taking</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="6.47">their currency they don&amp;#39;t trust the</text>
  <text start="178.25" dur="4.42">banks because they are afraid</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="5.97">that there are going to be more capital</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="6.66">controls or a ballon and you can see</text>
  <text start="186.84" dur="5.459">that a lot of these individuals well</text>
  <text start="189.33" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re getting very nervous and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="192.299" dur="4.951">taking the currency and they&amp;#39;re placing</text>
  <text start="195.12" dur="6.539">their currency in their homes</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="7.98">safes bank lockers anyplace but the</text>
  <text start="201.659" dur="6.991">banking system and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="6.78">that eighty percent of this amount that</text>
  <text start="208.65" dur="6.83">is about thirty six billion euros well</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="7.819">they&amp;#39;re kept outside of the bank in</text>
  <text start="215.48" dur="7.33">these homes they&amp;#39;re very nervous about</text>
  <text start="219.829" dur="7.871">the banking system and capital controls</text>
  <text start="222.81" dur="7.92">and balance and we can see right now you</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="5.55">can&amp;#39;t wait for the last minute to start</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="5.28">doing this because when a bank holiday</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="6.42">comes when the baylin&amp;#39;s come and guess</text>
  <text start="236.01" dur="6.72">what you won&amp;#39;t have a chance to get your</text>
  <text start="239.67" dur="5.189">funds I mean these individuals that</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="3.659">thought everything was okay they started</text>
  <text start="244.859" dur="3.24">putting money back into the Greek banks</text>
  <text start="246.389" dur="3.121">now they&amp;#39;re realizing well we have</text>
  <text start="248.099" dur="3.691">problems once again because everyone</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="3.599">told them that everything is fine this</text>
  <text start="251.79" dur="4.11">is what they always say when they get</text>
  <text start="253.109" dur="4.921">more debt but what happens is they place</text>
  <text start="255.9" dur="4.32">capital controls then they increase the</text>
  <text start="258.03" dur="3.81">capital controls and it makes it harder</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="5.1">and harder to get your funds on to the</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="6.81">bank and we can see that many countries</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="5.909">today throughout the eurozone they are</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="5.19">hurting right now I mean if we look at</text>
  <text start="271.229" dur="5.131">France if we go back to 2013 when home</text>
  <text start="273.84" dur="4.56">on said you know the crisis is over</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="3.51">things are going to be improving from in</text>
  <text start="278.4" dur="3.09">France and the unemployment was like</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="5.43">something like ten point four percent at</text>
  <text start="281.49" dur="6.27">that point in that point in time fast</text>
  <text start="285.3" dur="5.299">forward to today the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="287.76" dur="5.61">has gone absolutely nowhere it is at 10%</text>
  <text start="290.599" dur="5.32">what it dropped point four percent it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.37" dur="4.14">still double digits it really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="295.919" dur="5.071">matter and it&amp;#39;s been bouncing up and</text>
  <text start="297.51" dur="8.029">down to ten point four ten point three</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="8.729">ten point two so nothing has improved</text>
  <text start="305.539" dur="7.151">since 2013 and you wonder why people</text>
  <text start="309.719" dur="4.501">want a different leader why they want to</text>
  <text start="312.69" dur="4.56">get out of the euro why</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="5.49">they don&amp;#39;t want a central bank because</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="4.38">they can see right now that things are</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="4.71">not changing they are getting worse and</text>
  <text start="321.63" dur="4.62">most likely this unemployment number</text>
  <text start="324.42" dur="3.18">this is the manipulated number because</text>
  <text start="326.25" dur="3.69">we know that eurozone many of these</text>
  <text start="327.6" dur="4.89">countries follow what the United States</text>
  <text start="329.94" dur="4.53">does where those people who are no</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="6.5">longer looking for work they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="334.47" dur="9.39">counted because we can see right now in</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="7.45">Greece and France in Spain in Italy the</text>
  <text start="343.86" dur="6.57">situation is getting worse and worse day</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="6.32">by day here in the United States we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.43" dur="4.74">seeing the manipulation is continuing</text>
  <text start="352.76" dur="4.09">they&amp;#39;re telling us that initial jobless</text>
  <text start="355.17" dur="4.56">claims well it ain&amp;#39;t up a little bit</text>
  <text start="356.85" dur="6.75">but it is at all-time lows going all the</text>
  <text start="359.73" dur="5.55">way back to 1973 which makes absolutely</text>
  <text start="363.6" dur="3.569">no sense because we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="365.28" dur="4.41">layoffs from major corporations from</text>
  <text start="367.169" dur="4.651">retail stores but we know how this is</text>
  <text start="369.69" dur="3.75">done once again they can easily</text>
  <text start="371.82" dur="4.16">manipulate these numbers to make</text>
  <text start="373.44" dur="5.4">everyone feel that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="375.98" dur="6.87">now we understand there is a student</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="6.24">loan problem and there is a petition</text>
  <text start="382.85" dur="4.48">that has been put up on the</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="6.35">whitehouse.gov where they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="387.33" dur="7.05">we need to allow students to go bankrupt</text>
  <text start="391.43" dur="7.65">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="394.38" dur="6.84">is that students cannot find jobs and</text>
  <text start="399.08" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="401.22" dur="5.34">paying these student loans back and</text>
  <text start="404.63" dur="3.01">bankruptcy in the United States is</text>
  <text start="406.56" dur="4.08">governed under the US Constitution</text>
  <text start="407.64" dur="5.49">article 1 section 8 Clause 4 which</text>
  <text start="410.64" dur="5.22">authorizes Congress to enact uniform</text>
  <text start="413.13" dur="4.23">laws on the subject of bankruptcies</text>
  <text start="415.86" dur="7.43">throughout the United States</text>
  <text start="417.36" dur="10.08">now they excluded student loans which is</text>
  <text start="423.29" dur="9.4">ridiculous because when you look at this</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="8.07">you can see that this is the only loan</text>
  <text start="432.69" dur="6.479">that you cannot declare bankruptcy on</text>
  <text start="435.51" dur="9.06">you cannot discharge the student loans</text>
  <text start="439.169" dur="8.161">in bankruptcy so this is a major problem</text>
  <text start="444.57" dur="5.04">the question is why is this</text>
  <text start="447.33" dur="3.839">why did they decide to do this well if</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="6.36">we got to go back to the Clinton</text>
  <text start="451.169" dur="8.761">administration and what they did back</text>
  <text start="455.97" dur="6.87">then in October 7th 1998 Clinton signed</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="4.799">the higher education amendment which</text>
  <text start="462.84" dur="3.93">provided federal federal funding for</text>
  <text start="464.729" dur="6.211">education loans at a reduced rate of</text>
  <text start="466.77" dur="5.79">interest however he sneaked in to</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="5.819">specific changes regarding the</text>
  <text start="472.56" dur="6.569">collection of student loans that was</text>
  <text start="476.759" dur="6.921">like a gift to the banks where they were</text>
  <text start="479.129" dur="8.13">guaranteed that they had to be paid back</text>
  <text start="483.68" dur="6.16">because they knew that if they declared</text>
  <text start="487.259" dur="6.181">bankruptcy and all this was discharged</text>
  <text start="489.84" dur="9.21">the bankers would lose out so this was a</text>
  <text start="493.44" dur="9.21">gift to the banking community and what</text>
  <text start="499.05" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that 65% well</text>
  <text start="502.65" dur="6.359">they cannot find a job and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="504.93" dur="7.68">pay back their loans and I know they</text>
  <text start="509.009" dur="5.431">made a different type of repayment</text>
  <text start="512.61" dur="4.77">schedules but when you&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="514.44" dur="5.07">part-time jobs or you can&amp;#39;t find a job</text>
  <text start="517.38" dur="3.839">at all and you don&amp;#39;t have the funds</text>
  <text start="519.51" dur="4.74">coming in it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the</text>
  <text start="521.219" dur="7.351">repayment schedules like it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="524.25" dur="7.32">difficult to survive now we can see out</text>
  <text start="528.57" dur="5.61">in the housing market housing starts</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="6.57">while they declined by 2.6 percent they</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="6.96">expected a point 1 increase and again we</text>
  <text start="538.14" dur="4.62">can see that the economic situation</text>
  <text start="541.14" dur="3.93">around the country is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="542.76" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re seeing retail stores closed retail</text>
  <text start="545.07" dur="4.95">sales are declining we see housing that</text>
  <text start="547.95" dur="3.99">is declining mortgage a mortgage</text>
  <text start="550.02" dur="4.05">applications are down negative 3.7</text>
  <text start="551.94" dur="4.98">percent so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="554.07" dur="5.4">is things are rapidly deteriorating and</text>
  <text start="556.92" dur="4.65">we know from Janet Yellen who&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="559.47" dur="3.84">said well the economy is getting weaker</text>
  <text start="561.57" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s funny just four or five weeks ago</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="4.469">she said the economy was strong Obama</text>
  <text start="566.07" dur="3.54">said he was handing off a strong economy</text>
  <text start="567.779" dur="4.31">to President Trump and now all of a</text>
  <text start="569.61" dur="5.43">sudden the economy is weakening and</text>
  <text start="572.089" dur="6.19">remember don&amp;#39;t blame the Fed for this</text>
  <text start="575.04" dur="5.25">and we can see right now this is why</text>
  <text start="578.279" dur="2.881">they&amp;#39;re saying it because the truth and</text>
  <text start="580.29" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="581.16" dur="5.489">time ago the truth is eventually going</text>
  <text start="583.98" dur="4.649">to shine through the real economic hard</text>
  <text start="586.649" dur="4.291">data is going to crash through the</text>
  <text start="588.629" dur="4.681">illusion and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="590.94" dur="5.55">right now and remember there&amp;#39;s a fight</text>
  <text start="593.31" dur="5.55">going on right now because the central</text>
  <text start="596.49" dur="3.75">bank they just can&amp;#39;t bring the economy</text>
  <text start="598.86" dur="5.099">down right now that I&amp;#39;m sure they wish</text>
  <text start="600.24" dur="5.88">they could but they can&amp;#39;t because who do</text>
  <text start="603.959" dur="4.351">they blame it on well they can&amp;#39;t blame</text>
  <text start="606.12" dur="4.56">it on Russia they can&amp;#39;t blame it on</text>
  <text start="608.31" dur="4.68">Trump just yet so they need to keep</text>
  <text start="610.68" dur="3.99">everything pretty much the way it is</text>
  <text start="612.99" dur="4.199">they can start the narrative of the</text>
  <text start="614.67" dur="4.38">story of the economy starting to get</text>
  <text start="617.189" dur="4.02">weak and if Trump puts forth his</text>
  <text start="619.05" dur="3.87">economic policies that will destroy the</text>
  <text start="621.209" dur="3.391">economy and we can see this is exactly</text>
  <text start="622.92" dur="4.169">what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point but</text>
  <text start="624.6" dur="4.14">Trump actually has the upper hand right</text>
  <text start="627.089" dur="3.571">now because he understands as a</text>
  <text start="628.74" dur="4.76">businessman when he looks around well we</text>
  <text start="630.66" dur="6.81">don&amp;#39;t have the tax receipts the loan on</text>
  <text start="633.5" dur="7.36">the country is 20 trillion plus actually</text>
  <text start="637.47" dur="4.979">200 trillion unfunded liabilities the</text>
  <text start="640.86" dur="4.589">interest rates are very low but if they</text>
  <text start="642.449" dur="5.13">start moving up we&amp;#39;re in trouble and we</text>
  <text start="645.449" dur="4.771">could see right now this business model</text>
  <text start="647.579" dur="5.041">for the country is not working and the</text>
  <text start="650.22" dur="4.71">only way to get out of it is to write</text>
  <text start="652.62" dur="5.94">off the debt that is the only way right</text>
  <text start="654.93" dur="6.719">now because we&amp;#39;re seeing that housing</text>
  <text start="658.56" dur="6.54">delinquency on FHA mortgages well they</text>
  <text start="661.649" dur="6.12">jumped in the fourth quarter since 2006</text>
  <text start="665.1" dur="6.479">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="667.769" dur="7.081">same situation that we saw in 2006</text>
  <text start="671.579" dur="7.471">moving forward and the delinquency rate</text>
  <text start="674.85" dur="8.609">jumped to 9% from 8.3 percent in the</text>
  <text start="679.05" dur="5.909">third quarter well researchers note that</text>
  <text start="683.459" dur="5.041">the increase was driven by mortgages</text>
  <text start="684.959" dur="6.6">made since 2014 and we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="688.5" dur="5.88">early stages of delinquency this is not</text>
  <text start="691.559" dur="4.89">a good situation if we see interest</text>
  <text start="694.38" dur="3.689">rates move up well this is going to make</text>
  <text start="696.449" dur="4.68">it very difficult for those people who</text>
  <text start="698.069" dur="5.19">have variable rate mortgages as more and</text>
  <text start="701.129" dur="4.14">more people lose their jobs and try to</text>
  <text start="703.259" dur="4.77">find jobs this is going to make them</text>
