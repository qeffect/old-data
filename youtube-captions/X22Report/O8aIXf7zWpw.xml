  <text start="101.58" dur="6.03">this entire system is a gigantic</text>
  <text start="104.79" dur="5.16">illusion it is controlled by the central</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="5.73">bank it was controlled by the deep state</text>
  <text start="109.95" dur="6.53">Trump now has the magic wand and he is</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="7.41">using all their tactics their weapons</text>
  <text start="116.48" dur="7.69">against them making the economy look</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="5.16">absolutely incredible and once you</text>
  <text start="124.17" dur="3.75">understand that the economy is an</text>
  <text start="125.91" dur="4.56">illusion and that there are no more</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="4.38">fundamentals and that everything is</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="6.33">completely controlled you can understand</text>
  <text start="132.3" dur="5.969">and realize how it all works now I know</text>
  <text start="136.8" dur="3.299">the mainstream media is out there and</text>
  <text start="138.269" dur="4.321">they&amp;#39;re telling us that who if interest</text>
  <text start="140.099" dur="5.041">rates come down and stimulus has started</text>
  <text start="142.59" dur="4.95">everything&amp;#39;s going to collapse and once</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="6.569">again if you go back in time and you go</text>
  <text start="147.54" dur="7.619">back to 2008 you saw in 2005-2006</text>
  <text start="151.709" dur="5.341">the Fed was raising rates they raised</text>
  <text start="155.159" dur="3.151">the rates up until a certain point where</text>
  <text start="157.05" dur="3.269">they knew everything would start to come</text>
  <text start="158.31" dur="4.98">crashing down and then they started to</text>
  <text start="160.319" dur="5.071">lower them very very quickly</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="4.169">and it took about two more years before</text>
  <text start="165.39" dur="4.769">everything just completely imploded on</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="3.39">itself Trump understands this the</text>
  <text start="170.159" dur="3.241">Patriots</text>
  <text start="170.849" dur="6.181">behind him understand this and they</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="7.14">stopped the Federal Reserve from hitting</text>
  <text start="177.03" dur="5.64">that tipping point now it the economy</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="6.029">might come down two years three years</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="6.03">from now and they realize once they</text>
  <text start="186.569" dur="5.551">start bringing down the interest rates</text>
  <text start="188.7" dur="5.069">once they start stimulus the economy is</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="4.289">going to look amazing I mean look what</text>
  <text start="193.769" dur="4.83">happened already they paused the rates</text>
  <text start="196.409" dur="4.261">in 2019 the Fed was planning to raise</text>
  <text start="198.599" dur="4.23">the rates and all of us and everything</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="3.56">was reversed since everything was</text>
  <text start="202.829" dur="4.731">reversed and it took a little while</text>
  <text start="204.23" dur="7.81">everything started to even out the</text>
  <text start="207.56" dur="7.149">downward spiral came to a halt right now</text>
  <text start="212.04" dur="5.729">we&amp;#39;re seeing that the Conference Board</text>
  <text start="214.709" dur="6.96">consumer confidence that data exploded</text>
  <text start="217.769" dur="6.78">higher and it jumped from 124 to 135</text>
  <text start="221.669" dur="6.93">people are saying the economy looks</text>
  <text start="224.549" dur="7.41">great it feels great and Trump and the</text>
  <text start="228.599" dur="5.73">Patriots are doing exactly what the</text>
  <text start="231.959" dur="4.441">Federal Reserve the deep state the</text>
  <text start="234.329" dur="4.59">mainstream media all combined have done</text>
  <text start="236.4" dur="4.259">before they use the statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="238.919" dur="4.35">to make everyone think that everything</text>
  <text start="240.659" dur="5.961">is fantastic if you look at pending</text>
  <text start="243.269" dur="7.5">homes for example all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="6.459">pending homes now they are rising by 2.8</text>
  <text start="250.769" dur="3.241">percent there are more contracts that</text>
  <text start="253.079" dur="4.891">are being signed</text>
  <text start="254.01" dur="5.819">why because once the rates were no</text>
  <text start="257.97" dur="3.629">longer moving up they started to come</text>
  <text start="259.829" dur="3.06">down people started to say hey you know</text>
  <text start="261.599" dur="3.391">something maybe I should be getting into</text>
  <text start="262.889" dur="6.691">the market now I can afford a home now</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="6.87">if the Fed lowers rates once again this</text>
  <text start="269.58" dur="4.5">will bring more people into the market</text>
  <text start="271.86" dur="3.45">now Trump is not going to do what the</text>
  <text start="274.08" dur="3.18">deep state what the central bank was</text>
  <text start="275.31" dur="4.02">planning to do he&amp;#39;s not going to crash</text>
  <text start="277.26" dur="4.92">the economy make all these people lose</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="6.24">their homes no that&amp;#39;s not the plan</text>
  <text start="282.18" dur="6.09">the plan is to take this system develop</text>
  <text start="285.57" dur="5.54">a new economic system which is running</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="5.369">parallel to the central bank system and</text>
  <text start="291.11" dur="5.23">transition everyone into that system the</text>
  <text start="293.639" dur="3.521">same thing happened back in the 70s we</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="4.15">were on a gold</text>
  <text start="297.16" dur="5.58">standard in the 60s approaching the 70s</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="4.5">the deep state the central bank they</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="5.85">created the petrodollar system that was</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="6.15">running parallel to the gold standard</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="5.04">system well partially the gold standard</text>
  <text start="311.14" dur="4.92">system and they maneuvered and</text>
  <text start="313.63" dur="4.5">transitioned everyone into a new system</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="3.78">now at that point in time we saw</text>
  <text start="318.13" dur="3.6">inflation high interest rates and</text>
  <text start="319.84" dur="4.26">everyone thought this is fantastic</text>
  <text start="321.73" dur="4.41">my house went five my house went from</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="3.33">five thousand dollars all the way up to</text>
  <text start="326.14" dur="3.27">twenty thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="327.43" dur="3.87">my salary went from three thousand</text>
  <text start="329.41" dur="5.42">dollars all the way up to eight or nine</text>
  <text start="331.3" dur="6.69">thousand dollars wow this is incredible</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="6.15">but it&amp;#39;s an illusion because when you</text>
  <text start="337.99" dur="5.22">come to the end of the entire system</text>
  <text start="340.98" dur="4.63">wages are no longer going up</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="5.31">you&amp;#39;re not seeing interest rates move up</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="5.52">you&amp;#39;re not seeing the same inflation all</text>
  <text start="348.52" dur="5.57">you&amp;#39;re seeing is the heavy weight of</text>
  <text start="351.13" dur="8.25">debt and the central bank system</text>
  <text start="354.09" dur="9.67">completely imploding on itself and once</text>
  <text start="359.38" dur="6.39">Trump and the Patriots have the Fed cut</text>
  <text start="363.76" dur="6">their rates which is going to happen any</text>
