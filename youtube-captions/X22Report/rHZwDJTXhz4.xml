  <text start="131.629" dur="4.681">areas the Fed and everywhere else</text>
  <text start="133.55" dur="5.21">because they need to control what is</text>

  <text start="145.79" dur="5.13">entire system is coming down because</text>
  <text start="147.8" dur="5.34">they need their people in the system to</text>

  <text start="181.01" dur="4.5">what the Fed has said the tariffs might</text>
  <text start="183.56" dur="3.45">wreck the economy we know the Wall</text>

  <text start="198.59" dur="5.28">economy and this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="200" dur="6.75">following this so we understand what is</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="5.13">happening how this was going to flow and</text>
  <text start="206.75" dur="3.959">it&amp;#39;s a flowing pretty much the way we</text>
  <text start="209" dur="4.109">thought it was going to happen and we</text>
  <text start="210.709" dur="6.15">see the establishment the central bank</text>
  <text start="213.109" dur="6.121">they&amp;#39;re creating this narrative and this</text>
  <text start="216.859" dur="4.261">is going to become worse before it gets</text>
  <text start="219.23" dur="4.53">a lot better because they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="221.12" dur="4.679">really push it now as time moves on and</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more articles and</text>
  <text start="225.799" dur="5.011">a lot more stories coming out on how the</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="5.13">economy is starting to fall apart we do</text>
  <text start="230.81" dur="4.92">have a new report and this is coming</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="3.93">from the OECD countries and this is the</text>
  <text start="235.73" dur="3.979">Organisation for Economic Cooperation</text>
  <text start="236.9" dur="6.78">and Development and in this new report</text>
  <text start="239.709" dur="9.34">we see that they&amp;#39;re warning that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.68" dur="7.679">a problem with wage stagnation and we</text>
  <text start="249.049" dur="4.711">see that what it says is they&amp;#39;re warning</text>
  <text start="251.359" dur="5.34">that positive employment trends are at</text>
  <text start="253.76" dur="6.21">risk of being derailed by unprecedented</text>

  <text start="259.97" dur="5.91">affect the low paid workers the OECD</text>

  <text start="289.16" dur="6.569">do not trigger a global slowdown now</text>
  <text start="293.599" dur="4.621">it&amp;#39;s very interesting that they said</text>
  <text start="295.729" dur="4.68">either a trade war or quantitative</text>
  <text start="298.22" dur="5.4">tightening and what they&amp;#39;re reporting on</text>
  <text start="300.409" dur="5.701">here is there is a slowdown in wage</text>
  <text start="303.62" dur="4.109">growth and they&amp;#39;ve listed all the</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="4.26">countries where this was happening</text>
  <text start="307.729" dur="5.94">Canada France United Kingdom United</text>
  <text start="310.37" dur="6.72">States Germany Japan Spain Australia now</text>
  <text start="313.669" dur="5.821">the report stressed income inequality</text>
  <text start="317.09" dur="4.049">has widened to unprecedented levels</text>
  <text start="319.49" dur="3.72">which has the</text>
  <text start="321.139" dur="6.18">developed into major structural issues</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="6.87">for oacd economies wage stagnation</text>
  <text start="327.319" dur="5.13">effects low paid workers much more than</text>
  <text start="330.08" dur="4.26">those at the top real labor incomes at</text>
  <text start="332.449" dur="4.321">the top 1% of earners have increased</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="4.379">much faster than those of poor middle</text>
  <text start="336.77" dur="4.47">class in recent years and this is what</text>
  <text start="338.719" dur="4.711">happens at the end stage of a central</text>
  <text start="341.24" dur="4.919">bank system everything starts to break</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="5.22">down all the wealth is filtered up to</text>
  <text start="346.159" dur="5.461">the top because they&amp;#39;re getting prepared</text>
  <text start="348.65" dur="6.15">for this entire system to come down now</text>
  <text start="351.62" dur="6.21">in June the OECD released a report</text>
  <text start="354.8" dur="5.729">titled inequalities in household wealth</text>
  <text start="357.83" dur="4.139">across osed countries which examined the</text>
  <text start="360.529" dur="4.5">distribution of household wealth across</text>
  <text start="361.969" dur="6.361">28 countries and it discovered that</text>
  <text start="365.029" dur="6.061">America guess what is the number one in</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="4.589">the world for financial inequality about</text>
  <text start="371.09" dur="4.62">10 percent of the American households</text>
  <text start="372.919" dur="4.321">own 79 percent of all the wealth in the</text>
  <text start="375.71" dur="3.449">country while the poor in the middle</text>
  <text start="377.24" dur="4.649">class which is about 60 percent of</text>
  <text start="379.159" dur="6.241">American households only owns 2.4</text>
  <text start="381.889" dur="5.791">percent of the country&amp;#39;s wealth and this</text>
  <text start="385.4" dur="4.229">is really what happens when you have a</text>
  <text start="387.68" dur="4.62">central bank running the country you can</text>
  <text start="389.629" dur="4.861">print like crazy and the system is</text>
  <text start="392.3" dur="3.899">coming to the very very end remember in</text>
  <text start="394.49" dur="6.63">the beginning of the system in the 70s</text>
  <text start="396.199" dur="7.261">what do we have we had a lot of currency</text>
  <text start="401.12" dur="4.759">that was being created we had inflation</text>
  <text start="403.46" dur="5.129">where people saw their salaries move up</text>
  <text start="405.879" dur="4.57">housing prices moved up everything moved</text>
  <text start="408.589" dur="4.5">up but there were very high interest</text>
  <text start="410.449" dur="5.071">rates to make it feel like the economy</text>
  <text start="413.089" dur="4.38">was just booming but actually it was the</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="5.97">beginning stage of the end where the</text>
  <text start="417.469" dur="5.401">economy was set up to die and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="3.539">seeing right now is that we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="4.74">end stage of all of this and this is why</text>
  <text start="425.029" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;re seeing all this wealth inequality</text>
  <text start="427.61" dur="3.869">this is why wages are stagnated this is</text>
  <text start="429.949" dur="3.18">why interest rates are very low if you</text>
  <text start="431.479" dur="3.15">really think about it everything that</text>
  <text start="433.129" dur="3.54">happened in the 70s when we came off the</text>
  <text start="434.629" dur="4.681">gold standard everything is now the</text>
  <text start="436.669" dur="5.571">opposite that&amp;#39;s how you know that things</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="5.639">are rapidly falling apart now</text>
  <text start="442.24" dur="4.539">applications for mortgages for new homes</text>
  <text start="444.949" dur="3.33">and we talked about real estate quite a</text>
  <text start="446.779" dur="3.211">bit we know that real estate is</text>
  <text start="448.279" dur="3.331">declining we know it&amp;#39;s declining in</text>
  <text start="449.99" dur="3.269">Canada we know it&amp;#39;s declining in</text>
  <text start="451.61" dur="3.38">Australia we know it&amp;#39;s declining in</text>
  <text start="453.259" dur="4.361">Europe we know it&amp;#39;s declining in</text>
  <text start="454.99" dur="4.71">the US and we have proof of this because</text>
  <text start="457.62" dur="4.06">application for mortgages for new home</text>
  <text start="459.7" dur="3.57">purchases fell by eight point eight</text>
  <text start="461.68" dur="3.78">percent in June</text>
  <text start="463.27" dur="3.72">compared with May and we&amp;#39;re TWiT and</text>
  <text start="465.46" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re down twelve percent compared with</text>
  <text start="466.99" dur="6.27">May of 2018 according to the Mortgage</text>
  <text start="469.72" dur="6.78">Bankers Association now this is very</text>
  <text start="473.26" dur="6.09">interesting because during the spring</text>
  <text start="476.5" dur="5.85">and summer months for real estate this</text>
  <text start="479.35" dur="5.52">is the big boom for real estate people</text>
  <text start="482.35" dur="3.6">love to purchase people go out they want</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="3.24">to be in their house before school</text>
  <text start="485.95" dur="4.95">starts it&amp;#39;s warm they can move</text>
  <text start="488.11" dur="5.04">everything looks great and when we start</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="4.29">to see things like this you need to get</text>
  <text start="493.15" dur="5.22">worried because things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="495.19" dur="4.95">breaking down and we know that there are</text>
  <text start="498.37" dur="3.54">countries out there that are moving out</text>
  <text start="500.14" dur="3.81">of the dollar that their deep dollar</text>
  <text start="501.91" dur="3.57">rising and we know this is Russia we</text>
  <text start="503.95" dur="3.6">know this is China and many other</text>
  <text start="505.48" dur="3.99">countries and we see an independent</text>
  <text start="507.55" dur="3.99">Chinese refiner they have suspended</text>
  <text start="509.47" dur="5.4">crude oil purchases from the United</text>
  <text start="511.54" dur="6.36">States and has now turned to Iran as one</text>
  <text start="514.87" dur="5.31">of its sources of crude and the reason</text>
  <text start="517.9" dur="5.43">why this is all happening is because as</text>
  <text start="520.18" dur="5.79">we know there are sanctions on Iran</text>
  <text start="523.33" dur="5.04">there are tariff penalties on China</text>
  <text start="525.97" dur="4.26">China is turning around and placing</text>
  <text start="528.37" dur="3.99">penalties on the US and they decided</text>
  <text start="530.23" dur="4.95">this would be their penalty to go and</text>
  <text start="532.36" dur="4.2">purchase the crude oil from Iran instead</text>
  <text start="535.18" dur="4.11">of the United States</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="4.83">now the IMF they have come out with a</text>
  <text start="539.29" dur="4.71">lot of different warnings they also said</text>
  <text start="541.39" dur="4.44">they needed a rainy day fund for the</text>
  <text start="544" dur="3.9">European countries just in case there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.83" dur="4.05">some type of economic shock and they</text>
  <text start="547.9" dur="4.31">started to explain that the economic</text>
  <text start="549.88" dur="4.5">shock could come from trade wars or</text>
  <text start="552.21" dur="4.06">something else that might occur maybe</text>
  <text start="554.38" dur="4.08">the brexit and of course what is</text>
  <text start="556.27" dur="4.26">happening here is they realize that the</text>
  <text start="558.46" dur="4.65">system can&amp;#39;t stay afloat and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="560.53" dur="4.86">using the excuse of the brexit using the</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="4.8">excuse of trade wars of why all of a</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="4.77">sudden the economy might come down after</text>
  <text start="567.91" dur="4.65">many many years of telling us how strong</text>
  <text start="570.16" dur="5.4">the economy is they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="572.56" dur="6.03">the economy might buckle under its own</text>
  <text start="575.56" dur="5.7">weight because of tariffs penalties on</text>
  <text start="578.59" dur="4.56">certain products where we&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="581.26" dur="4.8">get a percentage on the products coming</text>
  <text start="583.15" dur="4.53">into the country the brexit where they</text>
  <text start="586.06" dur="2.4">wanted to leave the EU which is really</text>
  <text start="587.68" dur="3.27">not happening at the</text>
  <text start="588.46" dur="6.27">point in time and they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="590.95" dur="5.91">excuses of why the economy might be</text>
  <text start="594.73" dur="3.9">imploding but we know because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="596.86" dur="4.2">following the economy most of the</text>
  <text start="598.63" dur="4.07">numbers there are manipulated what</text>
  <text start="601.06" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us all along and we</text>
  <text start="602.7" dur="5.68">reported on this many many times before</text>
  <text start="604.75" dur="6.57">where the IMF predicted the GDP growth</text>
  <text start="608.38" dur="5.85">where he hunts for 5% and it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="611.32" dur="5.43">wrong it always gets readjusted and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="614.23" dur="5.46">around 2% so it was around 2.3 percent</text>
  <text start="616.75" dur="5.04">maybe 1.8% and it&amp;#39;s always completely</text>
  <text start="619.69" dur="5.22">off on what they always say</text>
  <text start="621.79" dur="5.54">now the IMF right now they are warning</text>
  <text start="624.91" dur="5.67">that amid rising tensions over</text>
  <text start="627.33" dur="4.63">international trade the broad global</text>

  <text start="812.079" dur="3.361">we&amp;#39;ve been following it is how they</text>
  <text start="813.67" dur="3.599">created this illusion to make it look</text>
  <text start="815.44" dur="3.329">like it&amp;#39;s doing a lot better than it</text>
  <text start="817.269" dur="2.911">really is but we know a lot of the</text>

  <text start="867.22" dur="4.26">happening here we know that they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="869.26" dur="4.35">ones to blame we know it&amp;#39;s the central</text>
