  <text start="42.62" dur="5.7">august 27 2015 and the title this</text>
  <text start="45.89" dur="5.16">episode is as the collapse approaches</text>
  <text start="48.32" dur="6.12">the US government pushes the gun control</text>
  <text start="51.05" dur="6.06">agenda let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="54.44" dur="5.07">collapse geopolitical news we see right</text>
  <text start="57.11" dur="5.339">now since we are headed towards this</text>
  <text start="59.51" dur="6.33">collapse what are we seeing we are</text>
  <text start="62.449" dur="7.501">seeing them go after the guns why</text>
  <text start="65.84" dur="7.889">because they know a population that is</text>
  <text start="69.95" dur="7.35">unprotected is easy to control and the</text>
  <text start="73.729" dur="8.371">hour is late we saw the Virginia</text>
  <text start="77.3" dur="6.83">shooting we saw Bryce Williams which is</text>
  <text start="82.1" dur="5.79">really Vester Lee Flanagan that was his</text>
  <text start="84.13" dur="7.18">his name as a news reporter basically</text>
  <text start="87.89" dur="6.27">opened fired on a cameraman and a news</text>
  <text start="91.31" dur="7.83">reporter and of course it&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="94.16" dur="7.59">that he had a a 23-page facts that he</text>
  <text start="99.14" dur="3.899">sent off describing everything I mean</text>
  <text start="101.75" dur="2.19">first of all why would he&amp;#39;s a fax</text>
  <text start="103.039" dur="4.351">machine that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="103.94" dur="7.86">whatsoever but when you look at the</text>
  <text start="107.39" dur="8.369">video of this whole thing it seems very</text>
  <text start="111.8" dur="5.73">odd I mean he was ranting and raving you</text>
  <text start="115.759" dur="4.59">know that he suffered racial</text>
  <text start="117.53" dur="5.46">discrimination he had other instances</text>
  <text start="120.349" dur="5.071">with his other jobs it seems like this</text>
  <text start="122.99" dur="6.06">person was mentally disturbed he might</text>
  <text start="125.42" dur="7.86">even been on SSRIs and most likely he</text>
  <text start="129.05" dur="6.03">was and we can see right now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="133.28" dur="5.49">the weapon neckla it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="135.08" dur="6.03">saying ah it&amp;#39;s the car that caused the</text>
  <text start="138.77" dur="4.41">accident no it was the drunk driver the</text>
  <text start="141.11" dur="5.55">person who was drinking that got into a</text>
  <text start="143.18" dur="7.35">car that drove the car that hit 22</text>
  <text start="146.66" dur="6.99">people or hit a bus of children but</text>
  <text start="150.53" dur="6.06">people don&amp;#39;t say ban the cars this man</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="6.21">if you took away the weapon of the gun</text>
  <text start="156.59" dur="5.399">he would have used a knife or an axe but</text>
  <text start="159.86" dur="4.859">you know something when you hear these</text>
  <text start="161.989" dur="4.651">stories you never hear them say or the</text>
  <text start="164.719" dur="2.931">corporate media tries to stay away from</text>
  <text start="166.64" dur="3.439">those report</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="3.869">of people wielding knives or axes they</text>
  <text start="170.079" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t like to report on them if they</text>
  <text start="171.519" dur="4.431">kill a lot of people because it kind of</text>
  <text start="173.439" dur="5.55">messes up on their gun control agenda</text>
  <text start="175.95" dur="5.98">but we see right now the government is</text>
  <text start="178.989" dur="6.42">out there pushing the gun agenda their</text>
  <text start="181.93" dur="5.279">main agenda right now is to infringe on</text>
  <text start="185.409" dur="3.36">the Second Amendment and take other</text>
  <text start="187.209" dur="3.511">weapons away from the people but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.769" dur="5.791">a lot of discrepancies in this entire</text>
  <text start="190.72" dur="5.79">story when you look at the video you see</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="4.17">him approach the cameraman which is</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="5.64">facing away you see the news reporter</text>
  <text start="198.73" dur="6.99">and the person she was interviewing now</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="6.239">that person didn&amp;#39;t even glance over once</text>
  <text start="205.72" dur="4.919">now normally when you see something you</text>
  <text start="208.389" dur="5.46">just move your head a little bit not</text>
  <text start="210.639" dur="6.27">even a little bit then you see from the</text>
  <text start="213.849" dur="6.39">viewpoint of the gunman they he points</text>
  <text start="216.909" dur="7.47">his gun at the reporter and shoots many</text>
  <text start="220.239" dur="8.131">times now this is point-blank range the</text>
  <text start="224.379" dur="6.961">reporter didn&amp;#39;t grab her stomach or any</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="5.82">other part but ran and that as the as</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="4.619">the camera am was falling the camera was</text>
  <text start="234.19" dur="5.419">still filming she was still running and</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="6.75">he put a couple of shots into her and</text>
  <text start="239.609" dur="5.38">then as the camera fell it was still</text>
  <text start="242.709" dur="4.981">recording as it fell and then it just</text>
  <text start="244.989" dur="5.58">faded out to black first of all how did</text>
  <text start="247.69" dur="7.71">it fade off the black so regardless of</text>
  <text start="250.569" dur="7.95">this being a false flag or not it</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="4.98">doesn&amp;#39;t matter at this point because we</text>
  <text start="258.519" dur="3.06">are at the end game and they notice and</text>
  <text start="260.38" dur="4.529">this is why we&amp;#39;re continually seeing</text>
  <text start="261.579" dur="7.261">more and more of these events occurring</text>
  <text start="264.909" dur="6.54">I mean we just had one out of MSU it was</text>
  <text start="268.84" dur="6.42">a shooter this is Mississippi State</text>
  <text start="271.449" dur="6.72">University in Starkville and the</text>
  <text start="275.26" dur="4.83">university issued a maroon alert and it</text>
  <text start="278.169" dur="3.62">looks like there were two shooters you</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="4.53">notice how there&amp;#39;s always two shooters</text>
  <text start="281.789" dur="4.091">one was apprehended the other one they</text>
  <text start="284.62" dur="4.65">were searching for but everything was on</text>
  <text start="285.88" dur="8.009">lockdown no one was killed her injured</text>
  <text start="289.27" dur="6.869">they stopped it before it happened but</text>
  <text start="293.889" dur="4.291">we see that this is continually having</text>
  <text start="296.139" dur="4.111">now Walmart is saying that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="4.709">to stop selling the weapons used in the</text>
  <text start="300.25" dur="4.909">mass shootings they&amp;#39;re going to get rid</text>
  <text start="302.889" dur="6.121">of the assault rifles semi-automatic</text>
  <text start="305.159" dur="6.221">shotguns and other weapons and this is</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="4.529">exactly what the White House the Obama</text>
  <text start="311.38" dur="7.2">administration essential bankers want</text>
  <text start="313.539" dur="7.411">because a population that doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="318.58" dur="5.43">protection against a tyrannical</text>
  <text start="320.95" dur="5.25">government is very easy to control I</text>
  <text start="324.01" dur="5.76">mean you can go back in time to Stalin</text>
  <text start="326.2" dur="6.66">Hitler and all the rest and you can see</text>
  <text start="329.77" dur="5.3">that they took the weapons away from the</text>
  <text start="332.86" dur="4.47">people and they went ahead and they</text>
  <text start="335.07" dur="5.159">killed millions because it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="337.33" dur="5.49">easier to do that and of course our</text>
  <text start="340.229" dur="6.221">spokesman from the United States Josh</text>
  <text start="342.82" dur="5.52">earnest is out there saying that this is</text>
  <text start="346.45" dur="3.959">another example of gun violence that is</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="4.46">becoming all too common in communities</text>
  <text start="350.409" dur="4.741">large and small across the United States</text>
  <text start="352.8" dur="5.169">he said there are common-sense steps</text>
  <text start="355.15" dur="4.59">that Congress can take right now without</text>
  <text start="357.969" dur="3.51">infringing on the Second Amendment while</text>
  <text start="359.74" dur="3.929">I hate to say this but everything they</text>
  <text start="361.479" dur="5.131">do is infringing on the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="363.669" dur="5.851">everything they do that has to do with</text>
  <text start="366.61" dur="5.7">the freedom of speech infringes on the</text>
  <text start="369.52" dur="4.73">freedom of speech so they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="372.31" dur="3.84">infringe upon it no matter what and</text>
  <text start="374.25" dur="4.479">they&amp;#39;re going to try to push gun</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="6.18">legislation to try to take the weapons</text>
  <text start="378.729" dur="7.41">away from the people that is their main</text>
  <text start="382.33" dur="7.22">goal at this point now out in North</text>
  <text start="386.139" dur="6.541">Dakota it is legal for law enforcement</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="5.89">to fly drones now if you notice the US</text>
  <text start="392.68" dur="4.049">government is trying to ban drones for</text>
  <text start="395.44" dur="3.3">personal use because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="396.729" dur="4.381">nervous about is when this whole thing</text>
  <text start="398.74" dur="5.19">starts crashing down those people with</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="5.46">drones are going to use them so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="403.93" dur="4.44">trying to make it a law where everyone</text>
  <text start="406.57" dur="3.99">is not allowed to use them or there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.37" dur="4.799">limits on how you can use them because</text>
  <text start="410.56" dur="4.169">those people with drones with cameras on</text>
  <text start="413.169" dur="3.451">it or those people who are fitting the</text>
  <text start="414.729" dur="6.511">drones with weapons that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="7.38">cause a problem but in North Dakota they</text>
  <text start="421.24" dur="4.5">can actually put less than lethal</text>
  <text start="424" dur="4.74">weapons i&amp;#39;m going to call them lethal</text>
  <text start="425.74" dur="9.72">weapons they can put tasers on it</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="10.37">tear gas rubber bullets they can do all</text>
  <text start="435.46" dur="8.429">of these things because of House Bill</text>
  <text start="439.11" dur="7.679">1328 wasn&amp;#39;t drafted that way but when</text>
  <text start="443.889" dur="6.421">lobbyists representing law enforcement</text>
  <text start="446.789" dur="6.94">with that were tight with the drone</text>
  <text start="450.31" dur="5.37">industry they got their hands on it the</text>
  <text start="453.729" dur="3.81">bill stated intent was to require police</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="4.019">to obtain a search warrant from a judge</text>
  <text start="457.539" dur="4.171">in order to use the drone to search for</text>
  <text start="459.699" dur="4.861">a criminal evidence in fact the original</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="4.799">draft from representative Rick Becker&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="5.009">bill would have banned all weapons on</text>
  <text start="466.509" dur="5.22">police drones then Bruce Burkett of</text>
  <text start="469.569" dur="4.231">North Dakota Peace Officers Association</text>
  <text start="471.729" dur="8.331">was allowed by the State House committee</text>
  <text start="473.8" dur="10.619">to amend the bill and put a limit on</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="7.75">what type of weapons and is going to be</text>
  <text start="484.419" dur="9.481">like I said rubber bullets pepper spray</text>
  <text start="487.81" dur="10.01">tear gas sound cannons tasers all</text>
  <text start="493.9" dur="6.48">allowed on the drones the step before</text>
  <text start="497.82" dur="4.089">the actual weapons are going to go on</text>
  <text start="500.38" dur="4.62">them because this is what always happens</text>
  <text start="501.909" dur="7.921">it always starts off small where oh they</text>
  <text start="505" dur="6.57">can use it for investigations we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="4.319">going to mount cameras on it remember</text>
  <text start="511.57" dur="4.44">when they said all that well now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="514.149" dur="3.961">just going to have taser guns and tear</text>
  <text start="516.01" dur="4.98">gas and sound cannons and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="518.11" dur="6.419">be able to use rubber bullets on the</text>
  <text start="520.99" dur="6.27">drones the next step will just be able</text>
  <text start="524.529" dur="5.491">to take those right off and put the</text>
  <text start="527.26" dur="6.63">actual lethal weapons right on so slowly</text>
  <text start="530.02" dur="5.879">but surely they are doing it now out in</text>
  <text start="533.89" dur="4.47">Sudan it looks like the president there</text>
  <text start="535.899" dur="6.601">was forced to sign the peace agreement</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="5.7">it was threatened by UN action and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="542.5" dur="3.39">going to have to watch that situation in</text>
  <text start="544.06" dur="4.14">Sudan because I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="4.29">to hold I thinks things are going to get</text>
  <text start="548.2" dur="4.92">worse as time goes on because we can see</text>
  <text start="550.18" dur="9.029">this world is getting ready for World</text>
  <text start="553.12" dur="8.96">War 3 we see that Ukraine just got a</text>
  <text start="559.209" dur="4.541">debt write-off what</text>
  <text start="562.08" dur="4.23">wait a minute they told grease</text>
  <text start="563.75" dur="5.62">absolutely not no debt write-off</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="8.04">whatsoever Ukraine just got a debt</text>
  <text start="569.37" dur="7.74">write-off Russia once there are three</text>
  <text start="574.35" dur="6.86">billion that they invested in their euro</text>
  <text start="577.11" dur="6.54">bonds and they want it in december and</text>
  <text start="581.21" dur="5.35">Yatsenyuk is out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="583.65" dur="6.3">whatever we did is going to apply to</text>
  <text start="586.56" dur="5.34">Russia so they&amp;#39;ve written off twenty</text>
  <text start="589.95" dur="4.2">percent of the debt right now because</text>
  <text start="591.9" dur="4.8">they know this cannot be sustained but</text>
  <text start="594.15" dur="6.48">they allow this with in Kiev in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="596.7" dur="7.8">but not in Greece double standards right</text>
  <text start="600.63" dur="7.53">now because we know they&amp;#39;re not finished</text>
  <text start="604.5" dur="6.84">in Ukraine we know they need the</text>
  <text start="608.16" dur="4.65">southeastern area and Crimea because</text>
  <text start="611.34" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s where all the good stuff is in</text>
  <text start="612.81" dur="4.56">the country we see the Ukraine</text>
  <text start="615.93" dur="4.83">separatists they&amp;#39;re going to strive for</text>
  <text start="617.37" dur="5.07">another ceasefire September first the</text>
  <text start="620.76" dur="3.06">first week of school so they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="622.44" dur="3.41">you know something let&amp;#39;s just have a</text>
  <text start="623.82" dur="4.47">ceasefire kids are going back to school</text>
  <text start="625.85" dur="5.35">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="628.29" dur="5.46">because I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if Kiev</text>
  <text start="631.2" dur="4.77">and you have to remember they&amp;#39;re backed</text>
  <text start="633.75" dur="5.75">by the United States government and they</text>
  <text start="635.97" dur="8.01">do things to really make it look like</text>
  <text start="639.5" dur="6.67">the other side caused it and this might</text>
  <text start="643.98" dur="4.38">be the perfect opportunity for children</text>
  <text start="646.17" dur="3.72">going back to school they might try to</text>
  <text start="648.36" dur="5.7">do something with some type of false</text>
  <text start="649.89" dur="5.76">flag event washington says they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="654.06" dur="4.26">going to be involved in any of the</text>
  <text start="655.65" dur="7.08">ukraine peace talks but they will be</text>
  <text start="658.32" dur="8.37">involved in the transnistria dispute</text>
  <text start="662.73" dur="6.03">John Kerry was out there saying you know</text>
  <text start="666.69" dur="4.02">Washington is committed to be fully</text>
  <text start="668.76" dur="6.69">engaged in the talks because they want</text>
  <text start="670.71" dur="7.68">that area they already have Kiev so they</text>
  <text start="675.45" dur="5.43">feel they already have the country when</text>
  <text start="678.39" dur="4.56">they don&amp;#39;t have something that&amp;#39;s when</text>

  <text start="682.95" dur="4.97">they get involved that&amp;#39;s when they try</text>
  <text start="684.48" dur="7.29">to show that people are fourth down and</text>
  <text start="687.92" dur="7.779">we can see already the United States is</text>
  <text start="691.77" dur="7.169">already stepping into this situation and</text>
  <text start="695.699" dur="7.771">no why it&amp;#39;s the same thing that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="698.939" dur="8.07">seen in all the other countries we see</text>
  <text start="703.47" dur="6.919">Kiev right now is deploying boot missile</text>

  <text start="710.389" dur="5.2">it&amp;#39;s continually happening because they</text>
  <text start="713.399" dur="5.761">are getting ready for an offensive</text>
  <text start="715.589" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re preparing slowly but surely we</text>
  <text start="719.16" dur="4.469">see that France paid back Russia 900</text>
  <text start="722.069" dur="5.19">million euros for the two Mistral</text>
