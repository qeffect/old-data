  <text start="109.039" dur="5.981">Trump is going to blame every little</text>
  <text start="111.99" dur="6.75">thing on the Fed he needs to keep this</text>
  <text start="115.02" dur="5.159">out in the public domain why why does he</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="4.439">need to keep it in the public domain</text>
  <text start="120.179" dur="5.94">he needs everyone to continually hear it</text>
  <text start="123.179" dur="4.531">over and over and over again because</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="3.45">when the system comes down and you can</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="3.84">see the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="129.569" dur="5.521">reporting now that you know we might see</text>
  <text start="131.55" dur="6.36">a huge stock market fall we might be</text>

  <text start="137.91" dur="6.06">building this up now again Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.66" dur="5.159">been pumping this economy up using the</text>
  <text start="143.97" dur="5.37">same manipulation that the central</text>
  <text start="146.819" dur="5.041">bankers deep state used in the past and</text>
  <text start="149.34" dur="4.41">many people even myself when he first</text>
  <text start="151.86" dur="4.14">came into office had wise manoosh in</text>
  <text start="153.75" dur="5.58">there why are these people in these</text>
  <text start="156" dur="5.45">positions well it&amp;#39;s starting to become a</text>
  <text start="159.33" dur="5.31">little bit clearer right now of why</text>
  <text start="161.45" dur="6.19">Trump put certain people into Sur</text>
  <text start="164.64" dur="6.06">and positions now other people were</text>
  <text start="167.64" dur="7.02">forced upon him and those people he kind</text>
  <text start="170.7" dur="7.74">of got rid of but certain individuals he</text>
  <text start="174.66" dur="4.14">kept and there&amp;#39;s always a reason for</text>
  <text start="178.44" dur="3.69">this</text>
  <text start="178.8" dur="4.83">think about this for a second the entire</text>
  <text start="182.13" dur="4.02">system and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this</text>
  <text start="183.63" dur="6.48">for quite a while we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="186.15" dur="6.75">about how they manipulate all data how</text>
  <text start="190.11" dur="5.61">they manipulate the GDP during Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="4.74">term they went all the way back to 1929</text>
  <text start="195.72" dur="4.5">added in research and development into</text>
  <text start="197.64" dur="5.22">the GDP numbers recalculated GDP all the</text>
  <text start="200.22" dur="4.98">way to the present day GDP numbers look</text>
  <text start="202.86" dur="4.77">a lot better we know that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="205.2" dur="4.23">count you know certain people who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="207.63" dur="4.68">fallen off who are no longer looking for</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="5.25">a job well even though they are they</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="5.7">haven&amp;#39;t gone on an interview within four</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="7.46">weeks they&amp;#39;re considered they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="8.64">really looking and they&amp;#39;re not counted</text>
  <text start="222.14" dur="8.83">so they manipulate all this data they</text>
  <text start="226.65" dur="8.52">also manipulate the stock market now the</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="7.5">reason why Trump needed certain should I</text>
  <text start="235.17" dur="5.67">call them specialists in manipulation he</text>
  <text start="238.47" dur="7.019">needed them on board and he needed them</text>
  <text start="240.84" dur="9.54">to do what they do best manipulate the</text>
  <text start="245.489" dur="7.651">numbers manipulate the market do what</text>
  <text start="250.38" dur="5.419">they&amp;#39;ve always been doing and actually</text>
  <text start="253.14" dur="5.49">he wanted them to do a better job and</text>
  <text start="255.799" dur="5.711">guess what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="258.63" dur="6.45">just that he&amp;#39;s using these individuals</text>
  <text start="261.51" dur="7.529">for a period of time to manipulate this</text>
  <text start="265.08" dur="6.72">entire system he needs to show the world</text>
  <text start="269.039" dur="5.011">the mainstream media the people of the</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="7.38">United States that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="9.9">well because in the end he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="279.18" dur="7.26">say the economy is fantastic while he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.95" dur="4.83">pointing the finger at the Fed saying</text>
  <text start="286.44" dur="5.46">those are the individuals that are</text>
  <text start="288.78" dur="6.87">responsible that organization that is</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="5.349">private they&amp;#39;re responsible that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="295.65" dur="4.259">this whole plans about</text>
  <text start="297.249" dur="5.7">and as you can see as we move forward</text>
  <text start="299.909" dur="5.95">what is he going to do he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="302.949" dur="5.13">continually blame the Fed he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="305.859" dur="4.29">blame the Fed for layoffs blame the Fed</text>
  <text start="308.079" dur="6.02">for manufacturing blame the Fed for</text>
  <text start="310.149" dur="6.81">stock market crash blame the Fed for</text>
  <text start="314.099" dur="5.38">unemployment numbers going up blame the</text>
  <text start="316.959" dur="4.92">Fed for GDP numbers going down he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.479" dur="5.58">going to blame the Fed or blame the Fed</text>
  <text start="321.879" dur="8.25">for housing crash he&amp;#39;s going to blame</text>
  <text start="325.059" dur="7.47">the Fed for every single crash in this</text>
  <text start="330.129" dur="8.22">system he&amp;#39;s already started to do this</text>
  <text start="332.529" dur="8.94">and there&amp;#39;s a reason for this remember</text>
  <text start="338.349" dur="5.9">they&amp;#39;re responsible for the economy what</text>
  <text start="341.469" dur="6.15">have they been doing with the economy</text>
  <text start="344.249" dur="6.1">since they took control well we&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="347.619" dur="3.84">through these cycles pump the bubbles up</text>
  <text start="350.349" dur="4.08">crash him down</text>
  <text start="351.459" dur="6.08">pump the bubbles up crash him down and</text>
  <text start="354.429" dur="5.88">he knows when he came into office that</text>
  <text start="357.539" dur="5.35">this entire system because he said it</text>
  <text start="360.309" dur="5.01">when he was a candidate it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="362.889" dur="3.78">fake phony and false it&amp;#39;s not a real</text>
  <text start="365.319" dur="3.27">economy these are bubbles it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="366.669" dur="4.59">illusion but I think when he came into</text>
  <text start="368.589" dur="6.66">office he started to realize that the</text>
  <text start="371.259" dur="8.28">system was much worse and there was no</text>
  <text start="375.249" dur="6.48">way around it unless they pushed it to</text>
  <text start="379.539" dur="5.61">the edge and the only way to do this is</text>
  <text start="381.729" dur="7.61">to have those people on board to let</text>
  <text start="385.149" dur="8.37">them do what they do best manipulate</text>
  <text start="389.339" dur="5.14">make the economy of course on paper look</text>
  <text start="393.519" dur="4.56">incredible</text>
  <text start="394.479" dur="6.36">pump the stock market up that&amp;#39;s why he</text>
  <text start="398.079" dur="6.12">took control of all this yes this great</text>
  <text start="400.839" dur="4.43">economy is mine if the great economy</text>
  <text start="404.199" dur="6.21">comes down</text>
  <text start="405.269" dur="7.72">guess who&amp;#39;s to blame the Fed brilliant</text>
  <text start="410.409" dur="5.54">move now the mainstream media they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="412.989" dur="5.97">do anything about this they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="415.949" dur="7.59">but it&amp;#39;s not working but we could see</text>
  <text start="418.959" dur="6.391">worldwide the entire globalist system is</text>
  <text start="423.539" dur="4.781">completely</text>
  <text start="425.35" dur="5.4">tracking and imploding and it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="428.32" dur="6.72">worse and worse as every day that passes</text>
  <text start="430.75" dur="7.41">and it&amp;#39;s going to get a lot worse we see</text>
  <text start="435.04" dur="5.12">German pharmaceuticals Bayer they</text>
  <text start="438.16" dur="4.92">announced they&amp;#39;re gonna be cutting</text>
  <text start="440.16" dur="5.14">12,000 jobs now they employ a hundred</text>
  <text start="443.08" dur="4.65">and eighteen thousand jobs worldwide but</text>
  <text start="445.3" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;re gonna be cutting 12,000 people</text>
  <text start="447.73" dur="6.81">that&amp;#39;s roughly one in ten jobs why are</text>
  <text start="452.38" dur="5.94">they doing this well they&amp;#39;re blaming a</text>
  <text start="454.54" dur="5.34">lawsuit because of Monsanto they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="458.32" dur="4.94">blaming other things they&amp;#39;re also going</text>
  <text start="459.88" dur="8.1">to be dropping certain product lines</text>
  <text start="463.26" dur="7.74">selling off certain products and smaller</text>
  <text start="467.98" dur="7.53">companies that are attached to bear and</text>
  <text start="471" dur="6.64">this is absolutely awful and as we move</text>
  <text start="475.51" dur="4.07">forward and the economy deteriorates</text>
  <text start="477.64" dur="4.77">you&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more companies</text>
  <text start="479.58" dur="4.21">layoffs and of course they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="482.41" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;re gonna give other reasons why</text>
  <text start="483.79" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re doing it but the real reason is</text>
  <text start="485.11" dur="5.79">the entire system was built on an</text>
  <text start="487.33" dur="6.36">illusion these companies cannot support</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="4.73">the amount of people they employ right</text>
  <text start="493.69" dur="4.59">now there&amp;#39;s just not enough sales and</text>
  <text start="495.63" dur="3.97">also they have a lot of debt they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="498.28" dur="2.25">been buying back their shares I mean</text>
  <text start="499.6" dur="3.21">think about all these companies that</text>
  <text start="500.53" dur="4.65">bought back their shares what happens</text>
  <text start="502.81" dur="6.27">when the market goes down they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="505.18" dur="9.27">be in trouble we see jobless claims they</text>
  <text start="509.08" dur="7.83">have soared to eight-month highs so all</text>
  <text start="514.45" dur="4.769">of a sudden jobless claims have been</text>
  <text start="516.91" dur="4.77">dropping dropping dropping and now</text>
  <text start="519.219" dur="4.921">they&amp;#39;re moving up what else do we see</text>
  <text start="521.68" dur="5.16">happening we see real estate</text>
  <text start="524.14" dur="6.41">well that is declining very very quickly</text>
  <text start="526.84" dur="8.58">we see housing prices they are dropping</text>
  <text start="530.55" dur="7.65">people are coming down on prices just to</text>
  <text start="535.42" dur="8.16">try to move their homes inventory is</text>
  <text start="538.2" dur="7.9">moving up and pending home sales they</text>
  <text start="543.58" dur="6.06">have plunged by 2.6 percent month on</text>
  <text start="546.1" dur="8.06">month in October and this was well below</text>
  <text start="549.64" dur="8.61">the expected 0.5% month on month bounce</text>
  <text start="554.16" dur="5.219">now on a year-to-year basis pending home</text>
  <text start="558.25" dur="5.249">sales fell by</text>
  <text start="559.379" dur="8.2">4.6% this is the 10th consecutive month</text>
  <text start="563.499" dur="7.171">of annual declines now pending home</text>
  <text start="567.579" dur="8.99">sales fell in three of the four regions</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="8.699">and this is very important</text>
  <text start="576.569" dur="5.17">economists consider petting home sales a</text>
  <text start="579.369" dur="5.791">leading indicator because they track</text>
  <text start="581.739" dur="5.94">contract signings purchases of existing</text>
  <text start="585.16" dur="4.829">homes are tabulated when a deal closes</text>
  <text start="587.679" dur="5.31">typically a month or two later so this</text>
  <text start="589.989" dur="5.671">gives them a gauge of how well the</text>
  <text start="592.989" dur="6.06">housing market is going to be and if</text>
  <text start="595.66" dur="7.44">pending home sales is declining guess</text>
  <text start="599.049" dur="6.78">what the economy in the housing sector</text>
  <text start="603.1" dur="3.329">is not doing well now we knew this was</text>
  <text start="605.829" dur="3.69">gonna happen</text>
  <text start="606.429" dur="6.12">this shouldn&amp;#39;t not come as a surprise to</text>
  <text start="609.519" dur="5.581">anyone we went through this whole summer</text>
  <text start="612.549" dur="6.45">where housing sales they were pretty</text>
  <text start="615.1" dur="5.159">much stagnant and as the Fed continually</text>
  <text start="618.999" dur="3.69">raised rates which we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="620.259" dur="4.17">many many times before we knew it was</text>
  <text start="622.689" dur="4.11">going to push many individuals out of</text>
  <text start="624.429" dur="4.26">the market we knew that it was going to</text>
  <text start="626.799" dur="5.76">bring down the housing market now the</text>
  <text start="628.689" dur="6.36">housing market I do believe is the</text>
  <text start="632.559" dur="5.041">pivotal point where everything is</text>
  <text start="635.049" dur="4.5">attached to it and once that starts to</text>
  <text start="637.6" dur="5.669">break and fall apart and come down it</text>
  <text start="639.549" dur="5.88">hits many other sectors and when people</text>
  <text start="643.269" dur="3.48">aren&amp;#39;t confident in housing where</text>
  <text start="645.429" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re saying oh you know what my</text>
  <text start="646.749" dur="4.791">wealth is in this home because most</text>
  <text start="648.759" dur="6.2">people their wealth is in their home</text>
  <text start="651.54" dur="5.62">they&amp;#39;re depending on the appreciation</text>
  <text start="654.959" dur="3.43">they don&amp;#39;t want their housing price to</text>
  <text start="657.16" dur="3.359">go down they don&amp;#39;t want to purchase a</text>
  <text start="658.389" dur="4.021">house for two hundred thousand take out</text>
  <text start="660.519" dur="5.49">a mortgage and have the house go down to</text>
  <text start="662.41" dur="6">110 because now you&amp;#39;re underwater now</text>
  <text start="666.009" dur="4.29">you&amp;#39;re paying two hundred thousand on a</text>
  <text start="668.41" dur="4.649">hundred and ten thousand dollar house</text>
  <text start="670.299" dur="5.311">and guess what you can&amp;#39;t sell it because</text>
  <text start="673.059" dur="5.911">you lose everything and then guess what</text>
  <text start="675.61" dur="5.779">happened people contract they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="678.97" dur="5.419">to spend money so that goes into retail</text>
  <text start="681.389" dur="6.021">goes into many other industries and</text>
  <text start="684.389" dur="5.81">people stop purchasing</text>
  <text start="687.41" dur="3.9">this is what happened in 2008-2009 we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="690.199" dur="4.771">seeing the same thing happening right</text>
  <text start="691.31" dur="5.91">now but it&amp;#39;s a lot worse and don&amp;#39;t be</text>

  <text start="697.22" dur="3.989">that are working with him they know that</text>
  <text start="699.56" dur="4.8">this system the central bank system</text>
  <text start="701.209" dur="6.48">cannot continue to operate in this</text>
  <text start="704.36" dur="5.899">fashion that is why they have the key</text>
  <text start="707.689" dur="5.94">players in their positions this is why</text>
  <text start="710.259" dur="5.861">Trump is making new deals getting rid of</text>
  <text start="713.629" dur="4.2">the globalists trade deals I mean if the</text>
  <text start="716.12" dur="3.719">globalist trade deals were so great he</text>
  <text start="717.829" dur="4.471">would have kept TPP he would have kept</text>
  <text start="719.839" dur="5.43">NAFTA he would have gone along with</text>
  <text start="722.3" dur="6.209">whatever they said but he didn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="725.269" dur="5.07">reversed everything and you&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="728.509" dur="3.241">him reverse a lot more now he he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="730.339" dur="4.44">moving as fast as he possibly can</text>
  <text start="731.75" dur="9.439">remember the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="734.779" dur="9.36">bank&amp;#39;s they have created a system over</text>
  <text start="741.189" dur="5.08">many many years not 10 years not 20</text>
  <text start="744.139" dur="5.791">years not 30 years hundreds of years</text>
  <text start="746.269" dur="7.111">where it&amp;#39;s very difficult to unwind all</text>
  <text start="749.93" dur="5.909">of this in a couple of years and they</text>
  <text start="753.38" dur="6.24">did it on purpose they made everything</text>
  <text start="755.839" dur="8.161">so convoluted that it&amp;#39;s impossible to</text>
  <text start="759.62" dur="8.13">put the u.s. back to where it was prior</text>
  <text start="764" dur="6.63">to the central bank but what Trump needs</text>
  <text start="767.75" dur="5.699">to do right now which he is doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="770.63" dur="5.519">tried to make this whole entire collapse</text>
  <text start="773.449" dur="5.19">this transition scenario a lot less</text>
  <text start="776.149" dur="3.93">painful than it would have been under</text>
  <text start="778.639" dur="4.021">the central bank now can he make it</text>
  <text start="780.079" dur="5.25">painless no I think that&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="782.66" dur="5.299">impossible but he&amp;#39;s gonna try to</text>
  <text start="785.329" dur="5.101">minimize the pain for many people now</text>
  <text start="787.959" dur="5.021">many people are gonna get hurt I mean</text>
  <text start="790.43" dur="4.74">he&amp;#39;s just he just can&amp;#39;t stop it because</text>
  <text start="792.98" dur="5.549">you need to get rid of one system and</text>
  <text start="795.17" dur="5.55">you need to restart a new system and</text>
  <text start="798.529" dur="5.73">transition everyone over to the new</text>
  <text start="800.72" dur="6.15">system while explaining to everyone why</text>
  <text start="804.259" dur="5.31">this is happening and most of the people</text>
  <text start="806.87" dur="4.439">are not gonna understand why this is</text>
  <text start="809.569" dur="5.07">happening because they&amp;#39;ve been in a</text>
  <text start="811.309" dur="6.72">world a central bank world where they</text>
  <text start="814.639" dur="5.491">believe that debt is good this is the</text>
  <text start="818.029" dur="3.331">way it&amp;#39;s supposed to be and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="820.13" dur="4.019">other way in</text>
  <text start="821.36" dur="6.05">nummy works we&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed over</text>
  <text start="824.149" dur="6.391">the many many years to think this and</text>
  <text start="827.41" dur="6.7">those people they&amp;#39;re gonna have a very</text>
  <text start="830.54" dur="7.53">difficult time especially those people</text>
  <text start="834.11" dur="6.599">who believe in the paper dollar those</text>
  <text start="838.07" dur="4.68">people that are protecting their wealth</text>
  <text start="840.709" dur="3.361">with gold or silver maybe even</text>
  <text start="842.75" dur="4.589">cryptocurrency now I wouldn&amp;#39;t suggest</text>
  <text start="844.07" dur="5.1">just one insurance policy I would</text>
  <text start="847.339" dur="4.911">suggest many insurance policies is what</text>
  <text start="849.17" dur="6.479">I do personally to make sure that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="852.25" dur="5.29">protected all the way around and this is</text>
  <text start="855.649" dur="4.44">why you still need a little bit of cash</text>
  <text start="857.54" dur="4.83">this is why you need gold and silver</text>
  <text start="860.089" dur="4.381">this is why you need cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="862.37" dur="7.529">because you need to be prepared you also</text>
  <text start="864.47" dur="8.25">need food water medical supplies because</text>
  <text start="869.899" dur="4.891">when this transition happens a lot of</text>
  <text start="872.72" dur="4.71">things are gonna change things that you</text>
  <text start="874.79" dur="5.13">thought would never change they will</text>
  <text start="877.43" dur="4.32">change things that you never thought</text>
  <text start="879.92" dur="5.419">would happen like the store shelves</text>
  <text start="881.75" dur="6.209">being empty they might be empty and</text>
  <text start="885.339" dur="4.451">people I don&amp;#39;t think understand</text>
  <text start="887.959" dur="6.69">especially those people they&amp;#39;re sleeping</text>
  <text start="889.79" dur="8.4">that this most likely will happen and we</text>
  <text start="894.649" dur="4.741">need to understand that this entire</text>
  <text start="898.19" dur="4.91">system and we&amp;#39;ve been saying it for</text>
  <text start="899.39" dur="6.36">quite a while it&amp;#39;s an illusion it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="903.1" dur="5.26">something that the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="905.75" dur="5.519">deep state have created to make you</text>
  <text start="908.36" dur="5.58">think that things are okay here I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="911.269" dur="6.271">give you an example when we talk about</text>
  <text start="913.94" dur="6.3">unemployment yet to remember how the</text>
  <text start="917.54" dur="9.5">Bureau of Labor Statistics figures this</text>
  <text start="920.24" dur="11.279">out so if you have an individual who is</text>
  <text start="927.04" dur="8.08">working in a part-time job and they work</text>
  <text start="931.519" dur="6.481">one hour a week the Bureau of Labor</text>
  <text start="935.12" dur="6.12">Statistics basis the official</text>
  <text start="938" dur="7.199">unemployment rate on employees who did</text>
  <text start="941.24" dur="6.839">any work for pay or profit during the</text>
  <text start="945.199" dur="5.301">week being surveyed so if there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="948.079" dur="7.741">individual who has a part-time job</text>
  <text start="950.5" dur="8.18">worked one hour a week there were</text>
  <text start="955.82" dur="7.6">does that tell you how great the economy</text>
  <text start="958.68" dur="6.48">is no that&amp;#39;s manipulation to make it</text>
  <text start="963.42" dur="6.81">make the unemployment numbers look</text>
  <text start="965.16" dur="7.799">fantastic so the unemployment rate also</text>
  <text start="970.23" dur="5.4">fails to include those who have given up</text>
  <text start="972.959" dur="5.041">looking for work remember if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="975.63" dur="5.55">been on an interview within like four</text>
  <text start="978" dur="6.36">weeks or so you&amp;#39;re no longer included in</text>
  <text start="981.18" dur="6.48">this you&amp;#39;re no longer looking you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="984.36" dur="6.9">fallen off and you can see how these</text>
  <text start="987.66" dur="4.89">numbers are so manipulated that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="991.26" dur="3.99">when you look at unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="992.55" dur="4.649">and you say wow we&amp;#39;re down to 3.7 well</text>
  <text start="995.25" dur="4.92">if you have a part-time job and you work</text>
  <text start="997.199" dur="5.971">one hour a week yeah that&amp;#39;s great but</text>
  <text start="1000.17" dur="7.14">can you survive on that no that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1003.17" dur="6.84">these numbers are fake they&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="1007.31" dur="4.44">illusion and if you do this to GDP and</text>
  <text start="1010.01" dur="5.46">if you do this to many other numbers</text>
  <text start="1011.75" dur="6.149">they&amp;#39;re fake too because they manipulate</text>
  <text start="1015.47" dur="5.64">them in such a way to make you believe</text>
  <text start="1017.899" dur="4.5">that everything is great and then when</text>
  <text start="1021.11" dur="3.24">everything starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="1022.399" dur="5.071">everyone scratches their head and says</text>
  <text start="1024.35" dur="9">what happened here Trump has been using</text>
  <text start="1027.47" dur="8.13">all of this to push the agenda of taking</text>
  <text start="1033.35" dur="6.949">down the Federal Reserve the central</text>
  <text start="1035.6" dur="7.709">bank using their weapon against them</text>
  <text start="1040.299" dur="6.221">because do you really think the</text>
  <text start="1043.309" dur="5.221">mainstream media the central bank the</text>
  <text start="1046.52" dur="3.57">deep state is gonna say hey wait a</text>
  <text start="1048.53" dur="6.779">minute that&amp;#39;s not the real unemployment</text>
  <text start="1050.09" dur="6.99">rate it should be 15 18 percent Trump</text>
  <text start="1055.309" dur="3.841">then would say really this is the</text>
  <text start="1057.08" dur="5.76">calculation that was given to me I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1059.15" dur="5.76">using your calculation you&amp;#39;re telling me</text>
  <text start="1062.84" dur="4.62">that you lied all this time so they&amp;#39;re</text>
