  <text start="53.46" dur="5.25">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="5.129">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.71" dur="6.12">episode 1382 b and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.399" dur="5.371">September 19th 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.83" dur="6.179">episode is behind the scenes the US</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="5.52">China and North Korea are talking let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.009" dur="5.101">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="73.29" dur="4.71">and geopolitical news now we understand</text>
  <text start="76.11" dur="4.649">that through the Freedom of Information</text>
  <text start="78" dur="5.58">Act people can order public records and</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="4.441">take a look at them and they can do this</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="3.42">through the government but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="4.44">interesting is that the US government is</text>
  <text start="87" dur="5.19">now suing citizens requesting public</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="4.74">records all over the country now this</text>
  <text start="92.19" dur="4.65">violates the freedom the Freedom of</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="4.349">Information Act and it looks like</text>
  <text start="96.84" dur="4.65">throughout the US government a growing</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="3.691">number of organizations school districts</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="3.419">municipalities</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="5.16">state agencies well they filed lawsuits</text>
  <text start="104.909" dur="4.71">against citizens for making the Freedom</text>
  <text start="107.58" dur="3.72">of Information Act requests to obtain</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="4.11">public records now the governmental</text>
  <text start="111.3" dur="4.26">bodies argue that they are doing so to</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="2.491">let the Court decide a matter that isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="3.089">quite clear</text>
  <text start="116.22" dur="5.16">legally such as when the documents may</text>
  <text start="118.649" dur="5.61">be shielded by an exemption or privacy</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="4.83">law and that&amp;#39;s causing a problem of</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="5.581">course and becoming a new way for</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="7.11">governments to hide information from the</text>
  <text start="129.84" dur="5.88">everyday people and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="133.32" dur="3.96">point is that maybe they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="3.69">certain records out there because</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s been some dealings that they</text>
  <text start="139.41" dur="3.09">don&amp;#39;t want anyone to see and this is why</text>
  <text start="141" dur="3.09">they redact a lot of course they say</text>
  <text start="142.5" dur="4.65">well this is because of security reasons</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="4.86">but we know for we know really what</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re hiding a lot of</text>
  <text start="148.95" dur="6.12">information now WikiLeaks they published</text>
  <text start="152.07" dur="5.16">spy files from Russia this is a new</text>
  <text start="155.07" dur="4.02">cache of documents which it claims</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="4.319">detail surveillance apparatus used by</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="5.13">the Russian state to spy on Internet and</text>
  <text start="161.549" dur="4.711">mobile users and they dumped the</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="4.44">documents out there and we have to</text>
  <text start="166.26" dur="5.55">understand it&amp;#39;s just not the United</text>
  <text start="168.66" dur="5.06">States that spies on the people each one</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="7.11">of these countries the United States</text>
  <text start="173.72" dur="8.739">England Germany France Spain Russia</text>
  <text start="178.92" dur="7.75">China they all do the same thing they</text>
  <text start="182.459" dur="6.341">have their spy apparatus all set up they</text>
  <text start="186.67" dur="4.53">look at the internet they look at mobile</text>
  <text start="188.8" dur="4.14">users they don&amp;#39;t like encryption because</text>
  <text start="191.2" dur="3.869">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to break through and</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="3.99">you can see right now that yes</text>
  <text start="195.069" dur="4.231">WikiLeaks is showing it&amp;#39;s not just the</text>
  <text start="196.93" dur="5.52">u.s. it&amp;#39;s all of these countries when</text>
  <text start="199.3" dur="6.24">government is in control and they are</text>
  <text start="202.45" dur="5.43">doing whatever they do which is really</text>
  <text start="205.54" dur="4.68">not much for the people but for</text>
  <text start="207.88" dur="4.8">themselves they like to spy on the</text>
  <text start="210.22" dur="4.47">people they like to spy on individuals</text>
  <text start="212.68" dur="4.05">to see what is going on here now of</text>
  <text start="214.69" dur="4.71">course here in the United States this is</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="6">a violation of our rights in other</text>
  <text start="219.4" dur="5.4">countries it might not be which it</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="5.759">should be but they don&amp;#39;t have the same</text>
  <text start="224.8" dur="5.76">Constitution as we do now Trump is out</text>
  <text start="228.489" dur="5.041">there and he was speaking in front of</text>
  <text start="230.56" dur="4.92">the UN and he came out with a statement</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="3.78">that you know the United States might</text>
  <text start="235.48" dur="4.229">not have a choice but they might have</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="5.31">two dissents might have to destroyed</text>
  <text start="239.709" dur="5.431">North Korea and of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="242.62" dur="5.25">media is going wild over this and of</text>
  <text start="245.14" dur="5.46">course he&amp;#39;s calling kim jeong-hoon</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="4.74">rocket man and he&amp;#39;s saying rocket man is</text>
  <text start="250.6" dur="4.889">on a suicide mission for himself and his</text>
  <text start="252.61" dur="5.4">regime and what i see from this is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.489" dur="4.231">playing right into the Cabal making them</text>
  <text start="258.01" dur="4.71">think that yes we&amp;#39;re gonna be going</text>
  <text start="259.72" dur="5.04">after North Korea and from the past</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="4.14">he doesn&amp;#39;t really operate in this way</text>
  <text start="264.76" dur="5.28">many people think that he&amp;#39;s compromised</text>
  <text start="266.86" dur="5.85">the Cabal hasn&amp;#39;t maybe they do but I</text>
  <text start="270.04" dur="5.22">still think he&amp;#39;s playing the game maybe</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="4.08">he&amp;#39;s not doing it as well as he should</text>
  <text start="275.26" dur="3.42">be but you have to remember they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.79" dur="4.41">still attacking him they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="278.68" dur="3.81">investigating him and the corporate</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="3.33">media and this is coming out of Japan</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re saying that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="284.53" dur="4.83">building a nuclear-powered submarine</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="3.9">that they had that they hope to have</text>
  <text start="289.36" dur="3.63">operational by 2020 now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.46" dur="4.88">doing right now and this is part of the</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="5.96">Kabbalah they&amp;#39;re building the idea that</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="5.47">North Korea is going to become this</text>
  <text start="298.95" dur="6.91">incredible nuclear power and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="7.74">very close in getting there and we need</text>
  <text start="305.86" dur="5.28">to stop them before they do now when we</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="4.71">look at their technology and we look</text>
  <text start="311.14" dur="5.81">what they&amp;#39;ve done so far they really</text>
  <text start="314.26" dur="5.85">don&amp;#39;t have the ability to create a</text>
  <text start="316.95" dur="6.46">nuclear-powered submarine right now it</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="6.51">be a massive leap forward from the</text>
  <text start="323.41" dur="5.88">current Navy which has around fifty to</text>
  <text start="326.62" dur="5.34">sixty diesel-electric submarines to go</text>
  <text start="329.29" dur="3.84">from that to nuclear-powered submarines</text>
  <text start="331.96" dur="3.72">first of all they can&amp;#39;t even get their</text>
  <text start="333.13" dur="4.5">missiles to fly in the air so right now</text>
  <text start="335.68" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re just making this stuff up to</text>
  <text start="337.63" dur="4.95">make you believe that this is going to</text>
  <text start="339.67" dur="4.94">happen we see South Korea their news</text>
  <text start="342.58" dur="4.47">agency and remember the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="344.61" dur="4.81">intertwined with all these news agencies</text>
  <text start="347.05" dur="4.53">they have control over the news agencies</text>
  <text start="349.42" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re being fed different stories and</text>
  <text start="351.58" dur="3.45">this is why we get these stories from</text>
  <text start="353.2" dur="4.68">all these different corporate media&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="4.95">and they&amp;#39;re out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="357.88" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s another aircraft carrier that</text>
  <text start="359.98" dur="5.73">will be heading towards South Korea to</text>
  <text start="363.01" dur="4.77">join in with the Navy naval drills and</text>
  <text start="365.71" dur="4.14">we could see that they&amp;#39;re pushing this</text>
  <text start="367.78" dur="4.23">idea that we&amp;#39;re getting ready for some</text>
  <text start="369.85" dur="4.71">type of an invasion but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="372.01" dur="6.12">interesting is that Trump and G Jinping</text>
  <text start="374.56" dur="5.91">they have agreed to maximize pressure on</text>
  <text start="378.13" dur="5.34">North Korea now Trump and Zhi Jing ping</text>
  <text start="380.47" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;ve been talking quite a bit behind</text>
  <text start="383.47" dur="5.19">the scenes and according to Thomas</text>
  <text start="386.26" dur="5.67">Pickering the United States is involved</text>
  <text start="388.66" dur="6.36">in informal talks with representatives</text>
  <text start="391.93" dur="5.82">of North Korea and there&amp;#39;s been no</text>
  <text start="395.02" dur="5.16">diplomatic breakthrough as of yet but</text>
  <text start="397.75" dur="3.63">they are talking behind the scenes now</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="2.82">the corporate media really doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="401.38" dur="3.33">you to know about this they just want</text>
  <text start="403" dur="3.51">you to know that North Korea is coming</text>
  <text start="404.71" dur="3.54">to get us that they&amp;#39;re gonna be firing</text>
  <text start="406.51" dur="4.02">missiles they&amp;#39;re gonna be hitting Guam</text>
  <text start="408.25" dur="4.1">they&amp;#39;re gonna be hitting Chicago Alaska</text>
  <text start="410.53" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re gonna be blowing up these</text>
  <text start="412.35" dur="5.65">nuclear missiles over the United States</text>
  <text start="414.85" dur="4.86">creating a EMP wave pulse that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="418" dur="2.82">to knock out all electric and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="419.71" dur="3.21">saying that this is gonna happen in</text>
  <text start="420.82" dur="4.38">South Korea but right now the United</text>
  <text start="422.92" dur="5.39">States is involved in informal talks</text>
  <text start="425.2" dur="6.15">with representatives of North Korea and</text>
  <text start="428.31" dur="5.56">we can see that Thomas / Pickering the</text>
  <text start="431.35" dur="4.05">former US ambassador to Russia and u.s.</text>
  <text start="433.87" dur="5.01">Undersecretary of State for political</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="8.04">affairs is saying this and basically</text>
  <text start="438.88" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re talking with China with Russia</text>
  <text start="443.44" dur="5.76">the United States behind the scenes and</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="5.669">they&amp;#39;re looking to calm the situation</text>
  <text start="449.2" dur="4.679">down</text>
  <text start="451.389" dur="5.52">and we can see right now that these</text>
  <text start="453.879" dur="5.731">talks need to continue on because if</text>
  <text start="456.909" dur="6.6">they don&amp;#39;t the Cabal is going to try to</text>
  <text start="459.61" dur="6.329">push their event so in the background</text>
  <text start="463.509" dur="6.03">behind the scenes right now we have</text>
  <text start="465.939" dur="5.431">talks going on we see China and Russia</text>
  <text start="469.539" dur="4.111">they kicked off the second stage of</text>
  <text start="471.37" dur="4.859">their joint naval operations in the Sea</text>
  <text start="473.65" dur="4.889">of Japan and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="476.229" dur="3.81">Chinese fleet which consists of missile</text>
  <text start="478.539" dur="3.9">destroyers frigates submarines</text>
  <text start="480.039" dur="4.831">helicopters and many other pieces of</text>
  <text start="482.439" dur="6.301">equipment well they are staging this</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="7.53">huge naval drill right there and we can</text>
  <text start="488.74" dur="6.72">see that Russia China China they push</text>
  <text start="492.4" dur="6.09">their drills the United States the NATO</text>
  <text start="495.46" dur="5.31">push their drills and basically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="498.49" dur="5.19">just showing force on either side saying</text>
  <text start="500.77" dur="6.09">listen we know what you have we know</text>
  <text start="503.68" dur="5.88">what&amp;#39;s going on and you know we&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="506.86" dur="7.289">so take a look and we know for a fact</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="7.979">that Russia well they&amp;#39;ve knocked out</text>
  <text start="514.149" dur="5.88">many of the US ships they&amp;#39;ve knocked out</text>
  <text start="517.539" dur="4.951">their electronics and we had the USS</text>
  <text start="520.029" dur="6.091">Donald cook in the Black Sea it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="522.49" dur="6.48">odd that the ships that were hit by</text>
  <text start="526.12" dur="6.63">these two ships that were hit by these</text>
  <text start="528.97" dur="5.1">other vessels they weren&amp;#39;t able to steer</text>
  <text start="532.75" dur="3.72">away because they have all this</text>
  <text start="534.07" dur="3.75">equipment on their radar they understand</text>
  <text start="536.47" dur="3.239">what&amp;#39;s going on I mean think about cars</text>
  <text start="537.82" dur="3.629">today where they know that something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.709" dur="2.911">approaching from the side or the back or</text>
  <text start="541.449" dur="3.031">the front they have all these sensors</text>
  <text start="542.62" dur="4.89">you&amp;#39;re trying to tell me that these</text>
  <text start="544.48" dur="5.969">ships with all these sensors they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="4.59">maneuver without the crew maybe</text>
  <text start="550.449" dur="3.661">something else happened</text>
  <text start="552.1" dur="4.97">maybe the electronics were taking down</text>
  <text start="554.11" dur="5.31">and maybe the ship&amp;#39;s couldn&amp;#39;t maneuver</text>
  <text start="557.07" dur="4.81">during this period of time and maybe</text>
  <text start="559.42" dur="5.789">this is why this happened but we can see</text>
  <text start="561.88" dur="6.47">that there are problems occurring right</text>
  <text start="565.209" dur="6.901">now in the Navy especially with Russia</text>
  <text start="568.35" dur="7.239">jamming the aegis system and this is a</text>
  <text start="572.11" dur="5.4">main major problem now out in Syria we</text>
  <text start="575.589" dur="4.351">can see things are really falling apart</text>
  <text start="577.51" dur="4.71">for the Cabal things are not going well</text>
  <text start="579.94" dur="5.31">Dajuan is that out there and he is</text>
  <text start="582.22" dur="5.07">saying that the US</text>
  <text start="585.25" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t get me wrong turkey was involved</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="4.289">with this also but it looks like now</text>
  <text start="589.36" dur="3.959">turkey is moving closer to Russia so now</text>
  <text start="591.579" dur="3.661">they can point the finger at the u.s.</text>
  <text start="593.319" dur="4.531">saying that yes they&amp;#39;ve been supporting</text>
  <text start="595.24" dur="3.99">and arming the terrorists and the only</text>
  <text start="597.85" dur="2.969">reason Rwanda is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="599.23" dur="4.5">is because Washington has canceled the</text>
  <text start="600.819" dur="5.611">1.2 million dollar turkey weapons deal</text>
  <text start="603.73" dur="5.49">and Turkey is moving closer and closer</text>
  <text start="606.43" dur="4.44">to Russia and they&amp;#39;re also purchasing</text>
  <text start="609.22" dur="3.21">military assets from Russia at this</text>
  <text start="610.87" dur="4.17">point but we can see that he was very</text>
  <text start="612.43" dur="5.339">angry that the white Washington did this</text>
  <text start="615.04" dur="5.549">and he came out and said yes the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="617.769" dur="6">supplying weapons and working with the</text>
  <text start="620.589" dur="5.071">terrorists in Syria and we can see that</text>
  <text start="623.769" dur="4.411">this all the stuff is starting to come</text>
  <text start="625.66" dur="5.219">out in the open right now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="628.18" dur="5.459">gonna hear a lot of truth bombs where a</text>
  <text start="630.879" dur="4.38">lot of these nations well as things</text>
  <text start="633.639" dur="3.361">start to fall apart they&amp;#39;re gonna come</text>
  <text start="635.259" dur="3.06">out and say yeah this is what was</text>
  <text start="637" dur="4.56">happening and they&amp;#39;re going to point in</text>
  <text start="638.319" dur="6.27">the finger of who was in charge of all</text>
  <text start="641.56" dur="4.25">of this this is what we see happening</text>
  <text start="644.589" dur="4.5">right now</text>
  <text start="645.81" dur="5.529">we&amp;#39;re at the beginning stages of all</text>
  <text start="649.089" dur="4.47">these countries trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="651.339" dur="3.571">what direction they should go because</text>
  <text start="653.559" dur="4.231">think about what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="654.91" dur="6.06">the Middle East is falling apart the</text>
  <text start="657.79" dur="4.14">Cabal they don&amp;#39;t have control of the</text>
  <text start="660.97" dur="2.429">Middle East they thought they were going</text>
  <text start="661.93" dur="4.11">to go into Syria and they thought they</text>
  <text start="663.399" dur="5.16">were gonna go into Iran and they were</text>
  <text start="666.04" dur="3.029">gonna completely you know control the</text>
  <text start="668.559" dur="2.671">Middle East</text>
  <text start="669.069" dur="4.651">keep the petrodollar system running but</text>
  <text start="671.23" dur="5.159">now with Syria lost they can&amp;#39;t go into</text>
  <text start="673.72" dur="4.5">Iran so what do they have left well they</text>
  <text start="676.389" dur="4.89">have Iraq which is moving closer to Iran</text>
  <text start="678.22" dur="4.44">and Russia they have Libya we see</text>
  <text start="681.279" dur="3.75">general half-dollars trying to take</text>
  <text start="682.66" dur="7.08">control of the country moving closer to</text>
  <text start="685.029" dur="6.12">Russia we have Lebanon once again is</text>
  <text start="689.74" dur="3.659">removing the Islamic state from the</text>
  <text start="691.149" dur="3.87">country Afghanistan is working with</text>
  <text start="693.399" dur="3.271">Russia and China right now even though</text>
  <text start="695.019" dur="3.75">the United States is sending something</text>
  <text start="696.67" dur="4.5">like 3,000 more troops into Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="698.769" dur="4.32">this might be a clean up operation at</text>
  <text start="701.17" dur="3.719">this point because basically in</text>
  <text start="703.089" dur="4.1">Afghanistan all they&amp;#39;ve been doing there</text>
  <text start="704.889" dur="5.64">is protecting the poppy fields and</text>
  <text start="707.189" dur="4.661">continually keeping this war going with</text>
  <text start="710.529" dur="4.74">the terrorists they never wanted this to</text>
  <text start="711.85" dur="6.359">end and we could see that at this point</text>
  <text start="715.269" dur="3.781">the government in Afghanistan is working</text>
  <text start="718.209" dur="2.461">with Russia</text>
  <text start="719.05" dur="3.63">looking to purchase weapons looking to</text>
  <text start="720.67" dur="4.71">have Russia come in and defeat the</text>
  <text start="722.68" dur="5.49">terrorists so these troops going in</text>
  <text start="725.38" dur="5.67">there right now well most likely they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="728.17" dur="5.76">fighting the Islamic state but also they</text>
  <text start="731.05" dur="5.52">might be there to clean up what has been</text>
  <text start="733.93" dur="6.45">going on in this country we saw this in</text>
  <text start="736.57" dur="5.94">Syria where US troops flew in they</text>
  <text start="740.38" dur="4.17">evacuated the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="742.51" dur="3.45">destroyed all the paperwork and the</text>
  <text start="744.55" dur="4.14">bases and everything that was there</text>
  <text start="745.96" dur="4.59">because it was a mop-up operation and</text>
  <text start="748.69" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that this is</text>
  <text start="750.55" dur="5.1">happening in many different countries so</text>
  <text start="753.28" dur="3.72">when everyone is focused on all these</text>
  <text start="755.65" dur="3.45">troops are going in there to keep this</text>
  <text start="757" dur="3.51">war going I think it&amp;#39;s the opposite I</text>
  <text start="759.1" dur="3.03">think it&amp;#39;s a mop-up operation because</text>
  <text start="760.51" dur="3.93">people thought all these troops were</text>
  <text start="762.13" dur="4.83">going into Syria to keep the war going</text>
  <text start="764.44" dur="5.1">yes we do still have factions inside of</text>
  <text start="766.96" dur="3.9">Syria the CIA is still involved trying</text>
  <text start="769.54" dur="3.42">to push their agenda this is why you</text>
  <text start="770.86" dur="3.42">hear the news forefront this is why you</text>
  <text start="772.96" dur="3.51">hear the Islamic state that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="774.28" dur="6.57">gonna fight to the death but it&amp;#39;s a lost</text>
  <text start="776.47" dur="6.75">cause Russia Syria they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="780.85" dur="4.89">and pushing and pushing and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="783.22" dur="5.01">nowhere left for these paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="785.74" dur="4.14">to go and they&amp;#39;re gonna be scrambling</text>
  <text start="788.23" dur="4.2">outside of the country and this is why</text>
  <text start="789.88" dur="4.95">we saw the troops in there cleaning up</text>
  <text start="792.43" dur="4.55">after them I think the same thing is</text>
  <text start="794.83" dur="5.7">happening in Afghanistan right now and</text>
  <text start="796.98" dur="5.89">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the Cabal right now</text>
  <text start="800.53" dur="4.68">well the whole entire thing is starting</text>
  <text start="802.87" dur="5.01">to fall apart and there is nothing left</text>
  <text start="805.21" dur="5.73">for them to do except try to start a war</text>
  <text start="807.88" dur="5.7">with North Korea and this is their main</text>
  <text start="810.94" dur="5.49">goal because they need to do this before</text>
  <text start="813.58" dur="5.21">the economy falls apart and they are</text>
  <text start="816.43" dur="5.52">blamed the truth comes out and</text>
  <text start="818.79" dur="5.71">everything is exposed because if they</text>
  <text start="821.95" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t get this war started if they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="824.5" dur="5.58">get anything started we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="827.56" dur="4.86">truth bombs like you&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="830.08" dur="4.56">before and it&amp;#39;s going to shock the</text>
  <text start="832.42" dur="3.57">country we&amp;#39;re already starting to see</text>
  <text start="834.64" dur="3">them of course the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="835.99" dur="4.38">not going to broadcast them because</text>
  <text start="837.64" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re still controlled by the Cabal by</text>
  <text start="840.37" dur="5.49">the CIA so they&amp;#39;re not going to be out</text>
  <text start="843.28" dur="4.47">there telling you all this stuff just</text>
  <text start="845.86" dur="3.63">like the Pentagon was supplying weapons</text>
  <text start="847.75" dur="5.1">to the paid mercenaries in Iraq and</text>
  <text start="849.49" dur="5.789">Syria a lot of this is being kept quiet</text>
  <text start="852.85" dur="4.979">what&amp;#39;s happening in North Korea is being</text>
  <text start="855.279" dur="4.441">kept quiet they don&amp;#39;t want people to</text>
  <text start="857.829" dur="4.35">know what&amp;#39;s really going on they just</text>
  <text start="859.72" dur="4.349">want you to hear that we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="862.179" dur="4.02">going into North Korea that North Korea</text>
  <text start="864.069" dur="6.57">is going to fire missiles and destroy</text>
  <text start="866.199" dur="6.69">Guam to scare you into saying yes let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="870.639" dur="4.23">have a military operation let&amp;#39;s go into</text>
  <text start="872.889" dur="4.65">North Korea that&amp;#39;s what they want to</text>
  <text start="874.869" dur="4.56">happen this is what they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>

  <text start="879.429" dur="4.47">these stories this is why you keep</text>
  <text start="880.839" dur="5.131">hearing all of this because they want</text>
  <text start="883.899" dur="3.6">the American people to push Congress</text>
  <text start="885.97" dur="3.479">into saying you know something</text>
  <text start="887.499" dur="5.25">we better get them before they get us</text>
  <text start="889.449" dur="5.37">this is how the cabal works this is how</text>
  <text start="892.749" dur="6.03">the corporate media works and this is</text>
  <text start="894.819" dur="5.07">what we see happening right now but I</text>
  <text start="898.779" dur="4.47">think what&amp;#39;s happening in the background</text>
  <text start="899.889" dur="6.54">is going to basically stop all of this</text>
  <text start="903.249" dur="5.76">and the Cabal is going to be finished</text>
