  <text start="39.28" dur="4.459">economic collapse news brief for this</text>
  <text start="40.989" dur="6.961">Saturday now as we know out in Ferguson</text>
  <text start="43.739" dur="6.491">things are really starting to get really</text>
  <text start="47.95" dur="5.699">crazy out there and it seems like the</text>
  <text start="50.23" dur="6.27">riots the protesters it has not calmed</text>
  <text start="53.649" dur="5.991">down it&amp;#39;s actually escalating at this</text>
  <text start="56.5" dur="6">point and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="59.64" dur="5.229">right now it looks like there were</text>
  <text start="62.5" dur="5.1">protests and it looks like people went</text>
  <text start="64.869" dur="5.191">into that convenience store where</text>
  <text start="67.6" dur="5.519">Michael Brown was allegedly robbing</text>
  <text start="70.06" dur="4.89">which is really there&amp;#39;s no proof at this</text>
  <text start="73.119" dur="5.161">point and he&amp;#39;s innocent until proven</text>
  <text start="74.95" dur="6.87">guilty and it seems like that store was</text>
  <text start="78.28" dur="6.15">a major focus where rioters went in and</text>
  <text start="81.82" dur="5.52">looted that store and it seems that</text>
  <text start="84.43" dur="5.61">there&amp;#39;s about 200 protestors were</text>
  <text start="87.34" dur="5.01">clashing late Friday with the police</text>
  <text start="90.04" dur="5.43">there and there were tear gas being</text>
  <text start="92.35" dur="6.92">fired bottles being thrown and it seems</text>
  <text start="95.47" dur="6.719">like a lot of the people are pretty much</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="4.989">not backing down at this point now</text>
  <text start="102.189" dur="3.871">what&amp;#39;s something very interesting about</text>
  <text start="104.259" dur="4.081">this whole thing I mean I talked about</text>
  <text start="106.06" dur="4.5">it yesterday about the video being out</text>
  <text start="108.34" dur="4.139">there and there&amp;#39;s a lot of questions</text>
  <text start="110.56" dur="4.019">about it and why did they wait so long</text>
  <text start="112.479" dur="3.96">but of course they&amp;#39;re saying that this</text>
  <text start="114.579" dur="4.891">person that was with him Darien Johnson</text>
  <text start="116.439" dur="5.551">he&amp;#39;s an accomplice to robbery why didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="119.47" dur="5.969">they pick him up why didn&amp;#39;t they arrest</text>
  <text start="121.99" dur="6.449">him I mean still why haven&amp;#39;t they done</text>
  <text start="125.439" dur="5.19">anything and the whole story is really</text>
  <text start="128.439" dur="4.561">starting to fall apart now the the mayor</text>
  <text start="130.629" dur="4.711">in Missouri he is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133" dur="4.23">saying and the mayor the Ferguson I</text>
  <text start="135.34" dur="4.14">should say is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="137.23" dur="2.839">that the people that were smashing and</text>

  <text start="146.34" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re Outsiders they came in they</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="4.289">caused disaster they left and he went on</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="4.5">to say a lot of the people aren&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="153.659" dur="5.341">from our town but they came in and stole</text>
  <text start="156.78" dur="4.26">from our businesses and left our town in</text>
  <text start="159" dur="4.29">ruins and made it look like there were</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="5.339">racial tensions here that simply aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="4.8">what they made them out to be so we can</text>
  <text start="166.379" dur="5.22">see right now and this is part of the</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="6.929">FBI DHS bringing in agent provocateurs</text>
  <text start="171.599" dur="5.821">trying to gin something up and have them</text>
  <text start="175.019" dur="4.381">create havoc in the area and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="177.42" dur="4.679">hoping that more and more people join in</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="6">and this continues and it spreads across</text>
  <text start="182.099" dur="4.801">the United States and we understand</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="4.5">there is a lot of protests that are</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="4.47">being being held in many many cities</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="3.479">across the United States we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="4.019">one out in LA going to happen on Sunday</text>
  <text start="193.379" dur="3.961">and there&amp;#39;s many in different cities</text>
  <text start="195.389" dur="3.99">like New York and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="5.28">see how this thing starts to ramp up but</text>
  <text start="199.379" dur="5.911">representative John Lewis he is calling</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="4.489">for martial law in Ferguson Missouri</text>
  <text start="205.29" dur="4.919">right now John Lewis the Democrat</text>
  <text start="207.109" dur="5.111">congressman from Georgia is saying that</text>
  <text start="210.209" dur="4.65">he&amp;#39;s calling on President Barack Obama</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="6.03">to declare martial law in Ferguson</text>
  <text start="214.859" dur="5.16">Missouri on Thursday and he said my own</text>
  <text start="218.25" dur="3.629">feeling is right now is that the</text>
  <text start="220.019" dur="4.701">President Obama should use his authority</text>
  <text start="221.879" dur="4.08">of his office to declare martial law</text>
  <text start="224.72" dur="3.009">federalized</text>
  <text start="225.959" dur="4.11">the Missouri National Guard to protect</text>
  <text start="227.729" dur="3.84">the people as they protest</text>
  <text start="230.069" dur="3.871">well that&amp;#39;s not what martial law is</text>
  <text start="231.569" dur="5.09">going to do but of course we can see</text>
  <text start="233.94" dur="5.729">already it&amp;#39;s being pushed out there to</text>
  <text start="236.659" dur="4.75">pretty much declare martial law now</text>
  <text start="239.669" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re not going to do anything just</text>
  <text start="241.409" dur="4.26">yet and we know that the FBI is taken</text>
  <text start="243.659" dur="3.69">over the investigation we understand Al</text>
  <text start="245.669" dur="4.921">Sharpton&amp;#39;s coming into the scene we have</text>
  <text start="247.349" dur="5.61">a burial going on very soon and we can</text>
  <text start="250.59" dur="6.48">see that this situation is continually</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="6.12">being pushed and we know the outcome of</text>
  <text start="257.07" dur="4.259">this because we understand and from</text>
  <text start="259.079" dur="4.801">other sources that DHS is involved in</text>
  <text start="261.329" dur="4.83">this also and we have to continually</text>
  <text start="263.88" dur="4.71">watch us to make sure that this when</text>
  <text start="266.159" dur="5.161">this spreads to other cities this will</text>
  <text start="268.59" dur="4.93">be the indicator that yes this is a</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="3.849">false flag event</text>
  <text start="273.52" dur="4.26">trying to declare martial law in the</text>
  <text start="275.169" dur="4.741">country or they are trying just to</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="6.27">condition us at this point for what is</text>
  <text start="279.91" dur="7.17">coming now it looks like because of the</text>
  <text start="284.05" dur="5.519">Russian sanctions that Putin has placed</text>
  <text start="287.08" dur="4.53">on Europe a lot of the European</text>
  <text start="289.569" dur="5.91">countries like Germany Slovakia Great</text>
  <text start="291.61" dur="6.54">Greece checklist vaakya are urging I</text>
  <text start="295.479" dur="5.641">should say the Czech Republic are urging</text>
  <text start="298.15" dur="6.62">an end to the Russian sanctions right</text>
  <text start="301.12" dur="7.079">now Greece is in talks with Russia and</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="5.53">they might splinter off and say we are</text>
  <text start="308.199" dur="4.261">not part of these sanctions anymore and</text>
  <text start="310.3" dur="5.369">we would like to continue supplying you</text>
  <text start="312.46" dur="5.28">with food Czech Republic the finance</text>
  <text start="315.669" dur="4.771">minister is saying that these sanctions</text>
  <text start="317.74" dur="4.98">on Russia make no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="320.44" dur="5.219">and we&amp;#39;re seeing from many of the</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="4.74">European countries they&amp;#39;re all looking</text>
  <text start="325.659" dur="4.41">at the situation and saying why are we</text>
  <text start="327.46" dur="6.63">doing this it makes no sense at this</text>
  <text start="330.069" dur="5.85">point why are we hurting ourselves so it</text>
  <text start="334.09" dur="3.75">looks like a lot of them are looking at</text>
  <text start="335.919" dur="3.18">this and they&amp;#39;re going to start backing</text>
  <text start="337.84" dur="4.049">off and we&amp;#39;re going to have to see how</text>
  <text start="339.099" dur="6.771">this plays out now in a report that I</text>
  <text start="341.889" dur="5.881">did earlier we know that a dance bank</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="3.519">official was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="347.77" dur="4.049">within three months of these sanctions</text>
  <text start="349.389" dur="3.75">and the food ban will be completely gone</text>
  <text start="351.819" dur="4.021">because Europe is going to look at the</text>
  <text start="353.139" dur="3.541">situation and say you know what we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="3.389">do this anymore</text>
  <text start="356.68" dur="4.769">and they&amp;#39;re going to pretty much remove</text>
  <text start="359.229" dur="5.791">their sanctions Russia&amp;#39;s going to do the</text>
  <text start="361.449" dur="5.011">same and they&amp;#39;ll be exporting food back</text>
  <text start="365.02" dur="3.54">to Russia so we&amp;#39;re going to have to see</text>
  <text start="366.46" dur="4.98">how this plays out and it seems like we</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="6.15">are headed down that path now it looks</text>
  <text start="371.44" dur="5.31">like we the Red Cross is helping with</text>
  <text start="374.71" dur="4.949">the humanitarian aid trying to get into</text>
  <text start="376.75" dur="5.49">Ukraine and of course Ukraine is really</text>
  <text start="379.659" dur="4.201">making it very very difficult to do this</text>
  <text start="382.24" dur="4.049">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the International</text>
  <text start="383.86" dur="4.89">Committee of the Red Cross has sent Kiev</text>
  <text start="386.289" dur="4.171">a written resolution confirming the</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="3.509">examination of the cargo the Russian</text>
  <text start="390.46" dur="4.769">humanitarian convoy is carrying and</text>
  <text start="392.259" dur="5.581">they&amp;#39;re saying that it looks pretty good</text>
  <text start="395.229" dur="6.021">is humanitarian aid there&amp;#39;s nothing else</text>
  <text start="397.84" dur="6.419">here the Red Cross had not yet received</text>
  <text start="401.25" dur="5.41">kievsky as reply as to whether it will</text>
  <text start="404.259" dur="5.191">recognize the convoy as humanitarian aid</text>
  <text start="406.66" dur="5.37">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is Kiev</text>
  <text start="409.45" dur="4.62">doesn&amp;#39;t want this aid to reach the</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="3.6">people in Donetsk and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="414.07" dur="4.65">what&amp;#39;s happening they don&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="415.63" dur="6.48">go any further now there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="418.72" dur="8.7">interesting story that in August 2nd</text>
  <text start="422.11" dur="11.04">2014 Ukraine was purchasing the t-72</text>
  <text start="427.42" dur="9.27">tanks from hungry and from the Hungarian</text>
  <text start="433.15" dur="6.3">army and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="436.69" dur="4.44">wondering if they purchase these t-72</text>
  <text start="439.45" dur="2.61">tanks might have you know replace</text>
  <text start="441.13" dur="3.81">painted them</text>
  <text start="442.06" dur="6.81">we put markings on them and use them to</text>
  <text start="444.94" dur="7.11">say this was the convoy that washer was</text>
  <text start="448.87" dur="4.29">trying to bring into Ukraine now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.05" dur="4.05">very interesting that they just</text>
  <text start="453.16" dur="4.41">purchased these tanks and nobody pretty</text>
  <text start="456.1" dur="5.79">much knows where they are at this point</text>
  <text start="457.57" dur="6.39">and we had this bombing of a convoy</text>
  <text start="461.89" dur="4.2">which they cannot show any type of proof</text>
  <text start="463.96" dur="4.05">we haven&amp;#39;t seen any satellite images we</text>
  <text start="466.09" dur="3.87">haven&amp;#39;t seen any photos and of course</text>
  <text start="468.01" dur="4.26">they have to include the markings the</text>
  <text start="469.96" dur="5.13">location of where these are Russian</text>
  <text start="472.27" dur="4.95">soldier uniforms and so far they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="475.09" dur="4.77">produced any of this now the US is</text>
  <text start="477.22" dur="4.98">saying we&amp;#39;re not sure what happened here</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re not taking either side and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="482.2" dur="6.09">not commenting at this point now we have</text>
  <text start="485.68" dur="4.41">to understand what is going on in Iraq</text>
  <text start="488.29" dur="4.62">here now we understand that Islamic</text>
  <text start="490.09" dur="5.07">state is inside Iraq causing havoc and</text>
  <text start="492.91" dur="5.52">chaos this is done on purpose the United</text>
  <text start="495.16" dur="4.98">States Israel UK other Arab nations have</text>
  <text start="498.43" dur="3.72">been supporting this and they want chaos</text>
  <text start="500.14" dur="5.1">in the region now we also have to</text>
  <text start="502.15" dur="5.67">understand that Russia has a Russian</text>
  <text start="505.24" dur="7.229">company Lukoil has made an agreement</text>
  <text start="507.82" dur="9.93">with Maliki to pretty much explore oil</text>
  <text start="512.469" dur="7.771">and gas in the area in Iraq and we can</text>
  <text start="517.75" dur="5.52">see they were about to finalize the deal</text>
  <text start="520.24" dur="7.11">right now and we also have to understand</text>
  <text start="523.27" dur="6.78">that the United States government</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="4.74">central bankers wanted Maliki removed</text>
  <text start="530.05" dur="4.98">now they supported him up to about</text>
  <text start="532.09" dur="6.02">almost May of 2014 now Maliki did a</text>
  <text start="535.03" dur="5.34">couple of things and one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="5.68">why all of this Kay</text>
  <text start="540.37" dur="6.27">was taking place it is because Maliki</text>
  <text start="543.79" dur="6.12">wouldn&amp;#39;t sign the bilateral strategic</text>
  <text start="546.64" dur="5.16">framework agreement now this is almost</text>
  <text start="549.91" dur="5.16">like the bilateral security agreement in</text>
  <text start="551.8" dur="6.71">Afghanistan where Karzai will not sign</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="6.6">this which would allow troops to stay in</text>
  <text start="558.51" dur="6.94">Afghanistan well the bilateral strategic</text>
  <text start="561.67" dur="6.66">framework framework agreement is pretty</text>
  <text start="565.45" dur="3.93">much very similar this agreement</text>
  <text start="568.33" dur="2.82">represents the strong</text>
  <text start="569.38" dur="3.149">military-to-military relationship</text>
  <text start="571.15" dur="4.11">between the United States and Iraq and</text>
  <text start="572.529" dur="4.861">provides mechanisms for increased</text>
  <text start="575.26" dur="4.17">defense cooperation in areas including</text>
  <text start="577.39" dur="5.43">defense planning counterterrorism</text>
  <text start="579.43" dur="7.83">cooperation and combined exercises and</text>
  <text start="582.82" dur="8.97">also gives the forces the ability to be</text>
  <text start="587.26" dur="7.769">in the country and since 2011 what</text>
  <text start="591.79" dur="5.04">happened was Maliki would not sign this</text>
  <text start="595.029" dur="4.651">agreement and this is why the troops had</text>
  <text start="596.83" dur="5.25">to be removed from Iraq but since that</text>
  <text start="599.68" dur="5.25">time period they are working on a plan</text>
  <text start="602.08" dur="5.19">to get the troops back in there and this</text>
  <text start="604.93" dur="5.04">is why we see the Islamic state doing</text>
  <text start="607.27" dur="5.46">this now when Obama took office he had</text>
  <text start="609.97" dur="4.83">buying it biden worked this deal out and</text>
  <text start="612.73" dur="3.66">he kind of messed it up and Maliki</text>
  <text start="614.8" dur="2.94">didn&amp;#39;t sign it and say you know what we</text>
  <text start="616.39" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t need the troops in in here and</text>
  <text start="617.74" dur="2.789">they pretty much said we want you out of</text>
  <text start="620.23" dur="2.52">here</text>
  <text start="620.529" dur="3.75">so Obama of course his campaign and</text>
  <text start="622.75" dur="3.06">everything that he was doing was saying</text>
  <text start="624.279" dur="3.451">you know this is all part of my campaign</text>
  <text start="625.81" dur="4.44">I got the soldiers out they&amp;#39;re out of</text>
  <text start="627.73" dur="4.89">there but that wasn&amp;#39;t really the case he</text>
  <text start="630.25" dur="5.55">had to do this because he didn&amp;#39;t sign</text>
  <text start="632.62" dur="5.46">the agreement now they forced Maliki out</text>
  <text start="635.8" dur="4.5">and they want this agreement signed by</text>
  <text start="638.08" dur="5.34">the new prime minister and of course</text>
  <text start="640.3" dur="5.55">once they sign it guess what troops will</text>
  <text start="643.42" dur="4.71">be back in Iraq we will have boots on</text>
  <text start="645.85" dur="6.54">the ground and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="648.13" dur="5">now is that this is exactly what is</text>
  <text start="652.39" dur="5.639">happening</text>
  <text start="653.13" dur="6.28">this whole Yazidi on rescue completely</text>
  <text start="658.029" dur="4.771">fell apart because there was really no</text>
  <text start="659.41" dur="5.46">one up there and the rescue plan was no</text>
  <text start="662.8" dur="6.45">rescue plan so what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="664.87" dur="7.35">now well the Anbar governor Ahmed caliph</text>
  <text start="669.25" dur="4.43">al halloumi confirmed meetings with the</text>
  <text start="672.22" dur="4.19">US diplomats and senior</text>
  <text start="673.68" dur="4.83">military officials and secured a promise</text>
  <text start="676.41" dur="4.5">of not only airstrikes against Isis</text>
  <text start="678.51" dur="5.13">holdings in the province but a military</text>
  <text start="680.91" dur="4.56">presence on the ground no date was</text>
  <text start="683.64" dur="2.88">decided but it will be very soon and</text>
  <text start="685.47" dur="3.48">there will be a presence for the</text>
  <text start="686.52" dur="4.56">Americans in the Western Area and this</text>
  <text start="688.95" dur="4.29">is confirmed by the governor Isis</text>
  <text start="691.08" dur="3.78">controls materially all the Anbar</text>
  <text start="693.24" dur="4.56">province at this point so we can see</text>
  <text start="694.86" dur="6.03">there&amp;#39;s going to be boots on the ground</text>
  <text start="697.8" dur="5.4">and it Isis is creating this opportunity</text>
  <text start="700.89" dur="2.699">and this is what they&amp;#39;re using it for</text>
  <text start="703.2" dur="2.579">now</text>
  <text start="703.589" dur="4.411">once boots are on the ground and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="705.779" dur="3.541">protecting the oil fields because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="708" dur="4.44">what they&amp;#39;re really protecting because</text>
  <text start="709.32" dur="5.79">they don&amp;#39;t want this uh the tribes to</text>
  <text start="712.44" dur="3.93">get to the oil fields because you have</text>
  <text start="715.11" dur="3.27">to remember two things are happening</text>
  <text start="716.37" dur="3.839">inside of Iraq we have the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="718.38" dur="4.32">which is creating chaos where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="720.209" dur="4.261">able to remove Maliki have a new prime</text>
  <text start="722.7" dur="4.47">minister and there have them signed this</text>
  <text start="724.47" dur="5.13">agreement and put boots back on the</text>
  <text start="727.17" dur="4.8">ground to stop these troops because to</text>
  <text start="729.6" dur="4.53">stop these tribes that are really rising</text>
  <text start="731.97" dur="4.08">up in all these countries and we can see</text>
  <text start="734.13" dur="3.959">this is how this is completely playing</text>
  <text start="736.05" dur="5.37">out right now and they&amp;#39;re really pushing</text>
  <text start="738.089" dur="5.731">the agenda and of course when this</text>
  <text start="741.42" dur="3.84">happens and boots are on the ground of</text>
  <text start="743.82" dur="3.54">course there&amp;#39;s going to be some other</text>
  <text start="745.26" dur="3.93">event that&amp;#39;s going to occur which</text>
  <text start="747.36" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ll say oh we have to bring more</text>
  <text start="749.19" dur="3.87">advisors more troops and it is mission</text>
  <text start="751.86" dur="3.78">creep and you can see how this is</text>
  <text start="753.06" dur="5.399">happening because their end goal is to</text>
  <text start="755.64" dur="8.04">bring troops in there follow the Islamic</text>
  <text start="758.459" dur="7.771">state to Syria Lebanon Libya Yemen and</text>
  <text start="763.68" dur="4.5">pretty much have boots on the ground in</text>
  <text start="766.23" dur="4.979">this entire region then start splitting</text>
  <text start="768.18" dur="5.55">it up and you can see this plan is going</text>
  <text start="771.209" dur="6.211">forward they&amp;#39;re not stopping now with</text>
  <text start="773.73" dur="7.95">Ebola it seems like hospitals in the</text>
  <text start="777.42" dur="6">United States are preparing and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="781.68" dur="4.26">hustling to prepare for the first</text>
  <text start="783.42" dur="4.59">traveler from West Africa who arrives in</text>
  <text start="785.94" dur="3.899">the emergency room emergency room with</text>
  <text start="788.01" dur="5.46">symptoms of infection with Ebola virus</text>
  <text start="789.839" dur="5.221">now dr. Thomas R Frieden director of the</text>
  <text start="793.47" dur="3.75">Centers of Disease Control and</text>
  <text start="795.06" dur="4.68">Prevention has said such a case is</text>
  <text start="797.22" dur="5.369">inevitable so all the hospitals are</text>
  <text start="799.74" dur="6.03">prepping for this and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="802.589" dur="4.271">interesting about this is the CDC put</text>
  <text start="805.77" dur="3.7">out some guide</text>
  <text start="806.86" dur="6.51">for the hospitals on how to handle the</text>
  <text start="809.47" dur="5.25">Ebola patients and the CDC says the</text>
  <text start="813.37" dur="4.8">health care workers treating Ebola</text>
  <text start="814.72" dur="7.56">patients need only wear gloves fluid</text>
  <text start="818.17" dur="8.58">resistant gown eye protection and a face</text>
  <text start="822.28" dur="6.57">mask to prevent infection from the virus</text>
  <text start="826.75" dur="3.9">now think about that for a second</text>
  <text start="828.85" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re telling each one of the</text>
  <text start="830.65" dur="3.69">hospitals and this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="832.06" dur="3.33">New York Times and the hospital is a</text>
  <text start="834.34" dur="3.99">little worried about this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="835.39" dur="5.37">telling them you need gloves a gown and</text>
  <text start="838.33" dur="6.09">one of those plastic face masks now on</text>
  <text start="840.76" dur="8.19">the CDC website it tells us that Ebola</text>
  <text start="844.42" dur="8.16">is airborne if you were in within three</text>
  <text start="848.95" dur="6.66">feet you can be infected so why aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="852.58" dur="5.67">they telling them to put those suits on</text>
  <text start="855.61" dur="5.43">that would protect them a lot better and</text>
  <text start="858.25" dur="4.8">the hospital staff they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="861.04" dur="4.23">saying well this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to</text>
  <text start="863.05" dur="5.34">us because you&amp;#39;re telling us that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="865.27" dur="6.17">airborne and you&amp;#39;re only telling us that</text>
  <text start="868.39" dur="7.08">we need a face mask a rubber gown and</text>
  <text start="871.44" dur="6.52">gloves so something is not right here</text>
  <text start="875.47" dur="4.83">something is being planned and it makes</text>
  <text start="877.96" dur="3.78">no sense whatsoever and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="880.3" dur="3.32">hospitals are saying well we&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="881.74" dur="5.37">little bit more comfortable if we had</text>
  <text start="883.62" dur="6.28">isolation rooms if we had the full moon</text>
  <text start="887.11" dur="5.31">suit to protect us and we&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="889.9" dur="4.89">down that route and who knows maybe a</text>
  <text start="892.42" dur="4.35">lot of the smaller hospitals might</text>
  <text start="894.79" dur="3.06">listen to the CDC and say okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="896.77" dur="3.09">what we need that&amp;#39;s what we have to do</text>
  <text start="897.85" dur="3.86">and we&amp;#39;ll see a lot more people getting</text>
  <text start="899.86" dur="6.18">infected with Ebola</text>
  <text start="901.71" dur="9.64">now again al Qaeda is out there and they</text>
  <text start="906.04" dur="7.08">are really pushing the the terrorism</text>
  <text start="911.35" dur="4.05">threat along with the Islamic state now</text>
  <text start="913.12" dur="4.35">we know this is all propaganda they are</text>
  <text start="915.4" dur="4.23">continually building building this up</text>
  <text start="917.47" dur="4.23">for the main event that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="919.63" dur="5.01">happen here in the United States and al</text>
  <text start="921.7" dur="5.4">Qaeda right now is saying and this is</text>
  <text start="924.64" dur="4.14">coming from the deadliest franchise and</text>
  <text start="927.1" dur="4.05">guess where the deadly franchise is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928.78" dur="5.37">in Yemen of course now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="931.15" dur="5.79">that we declare our solidarity with our</text>

  <text start="940.209" dur="6.87">as part of its plan for jihad military</text>
  <text start="943.589" dur="5.56">economically or through media and we</text>
  <text start="947.079" dur="4.17">call on every Muslim especially anyone</text>
  <text start="949.149" dur="4.081">who can enter America to champion his</text>
  <text start="951.249" dur="5.58">brothers by going to war against America</text>

  <text start="963.429" dur="5.94">agent provocateurs in there trying to</text>
  <text start="965.86" dur="5.069">spread this out so eventually the Obama</text>
  <text start="969.369" dur="3.69">administration could declare martial law</text>
  <text start="970.929" dur="4.35">on the country now we already have coals</text>

  <text start="982.749" dur="4.68">coming in and it will be inevitable as</text>
  <text start="984.79" dur="5.219">they come to the United States and then</text>
