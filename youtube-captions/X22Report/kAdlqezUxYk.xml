  <text start="91.66" dur="4.68">economic swamp and he&amp;#39;s already started</text>
  <text start="93.64" dur="6.36">to do this and the only way to do this</text>
  <text start="96.34" dur="6.24">is to cut off the funding at the source</text>
  <text start="100" dur="5.28">for the deep state for the central bank</text>
  <text start="102.58" dur="6.09">system remember the central bank system</text>
  <text start="105.28" dur="7.17">feeds into the deep state system so you</text>
  <text start="108.67" dur="6.6">need to shut down many of the programs</text>
  <text start="112.45" dur="5.31">many of these things that they set up to</text>
  <text start="115.27" dur="4.62">fund certain operations because we know</text>
  <text start="117.76" dur="5.67">that a lot of these funds that enter</text>
  <text start="119.89" dur="5.519">into these programs they normally don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="123.43" dur="4.47">go for what we all think they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="125.409" dur="4.561">for and we can see today Trump is just</text>
  <text start="127.9" dur="3.54">doing that we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that</text>
  <text start="129.97" dur="4.71">in just a minute but I wanted to start</text>
  <text start="131.44" dur="4.95">off with retail and we know that the</text>
  <text start="134.68" dur="5.94">American people when they spend their</text>
  <text start="136.39" dur="6.84">money in retail this is 70% of the GDP</text>
  <text start="140.62" dur="5.22">and we know this is a very important</text>
  <text start="143.23" dur="5.31">number because if people can&amp;#39;t purchase</text>
  <text start="145.84" dur="5.85">goods anymore and guess what the GDP</text>
  <text start="148.54" dur="6.18">suffers and this is what the central</text>
  <text start="151.69" dur="5.79">bank has been concerned with for a very</text>
  <text start="154.72" dur="4.32">long time and this is why they needed to</text>
  <text start="157.48" dur="3.689">come up with credit this is why they</text>
  <text start="159.04" dur="5.34">need people to borrow to purchase the</text>
  <text start="161.169" dur="5.461">automobiles to purchase even now today</text>
  <text start="164.38" dur="4.86">the durable good items like washers</text>
  <text start="166.63" dur="5.52">dryers any other type of electronics</text>
  <text start="169.24" dur="5.85">they needed people to continually borrow</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="5.04">borrow borrow which means to them spend</text>
  <text start="175.09" dur="5.19">spend spend spend which really means</text>
  <text start="177.19" dur="5.58">people are going into debt and what</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re seeing today is retail well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.77" dur="3.21">having a little bit of trouble now in</text>
  <text start="184.03" dur="4.47">the beginning when all this came out</text>
  <text start="185.98" dur="4.17">during the Obama reign they told us that</text>
  <text start="188.5" dur="3.48">it was the weather that&amp;#39;s why retail</text>
  <text start="190.15" dur="3.75">wasn&amp;#39;t doing well well it was snowy it</text>
  <text start="191.98" dur="3.57">was cold people didn&amp;#39;t go out oh it was</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="3.96">raining people didn&amp;#39;t go out and then go</text>
  <text start="195.55" dur="4.62">shopping well that started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="197.86" dur="5.19">because the brick-and-mortar stores they</text>
  <text start="200.17" dur="5.16">started to close up many file for</text>
  <text start="203.05" dur="3.99">bankruptcy and the situation just got</text>
  <text start="205.33" dur="4.68">worse so then they moved to well</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="4.53">everyone is shopping online now everyone</text>
  <text start="210.01" dur="4.14">is not using brick-and-mortar stores</text>
  <text start="211.57" dur="3.9">everyone is going to Amazon but then we</text>
  <text start="214.15" dur="2.79">started to break that down and we</text>
  <text start="215.47" dur="3.93">realize it was only a very small</text>
  <text start="216.94" dur="4.62">percentage where people shopped online</text>
  <text start="219.4" dur="5.19">compared to trillions and trillions of</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="5.07">dollars where people shop offline so</text>
  <text start="224.59" dur="4.35">that story started to fall apart yes and</text>
  <text start="226.63" dur="4.53">there is a trend think about it I mean</text>
  <text start="228.94" dur="4.77">the Internet is brand-new I mean</text>
  <text start="231.16" dur="4.23">compared to everything else and yes</text>
  <text start="233.71" dur="3.51">people are starting to get used to</text>
  <text start="235.39" dur="4.5">shopping online and that is going to</text>
  <text start="237.22" dur="4.74">grow but still it has not reached the</text>
  <text start="239.89" dur="4.37">trillions and trillions of dollars that</text>
  <text start="241.96" dur="5.49">we spend in the brick-and-mortar shops</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="6.16">people have been losing jobs people have</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="5.16">been trying to figure out a way to make</text>
  <text start="250.42" dur="3.48">ends meet and they decided you know</text>
  <text start="252.61" dur="3.09">something I just can&amp;#39;t go out and shop</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="3.18">anymore this is why we see a lot of the</text>
  <text start="255.7" dur="3.84">brick-and-mortar stores they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="257.08" dur="4.56">completely shutting down because the</text>
  <text start="259.54" dur="3.57">everyday person especially the younger</text>
  <text start="261.64" dur="2.91">generation and we see it here in the</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="3.87">United States we also see it out in</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="5.16">Europe the younger generation has been</text>
  <text start="266.98" dur="6.24">hit very hard why because we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="5.31">end cycle of a central bank system the</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="3.96">beginning cycle of a central bank system</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="4.05">which is back in the 70s we come off the</text>
  <text start="277.18" dur="3.93">gold standard and all of a sudden we see</text>
  <text start="279.07" dur="5.33">incredible inflation which means your</text>
  <text start="281.11" dur="6.12">salary goes up housing prices go up and</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="6.31">people then have access to credit and</text>
  <text start="287.23" dur="6.33">credit completely bloomed right after</text>
  <text start="290.71" dur="5.1">the 70s going into the 80s and interest</text>
  <text start="293.56" dur="2.94">rates came down now we&amp;#39;re on the other</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="2.8">end</text>
  <text start="296.5" dur="5.039">wages are decreased</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="6.42">cr√©dit what people are maxed out today</text>
  <text start="301.539" dur="5.62">jobs very difficult to find and this is</text>
  <text start="305.03" dur="4.109">why Trump is now trying to bring all the</text>
  <text start="307.159" dur="4.111">jobs back remember the plan for the</text>
  <text start="309.139" dur="5.161">central bankers was to move all the</text>
  <text start="311.27" dur="6.119">jumps jobs out of the United States so</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="5.31">retail is very important because it</text>
  <text start="317.389" dur="4.74">makes up 70% of the GDP numbers here in</text>
  <text start="319.61" dur="3.959">the United States and the central</text>
  <text start="322.129" dur="3.75">bankers have always had a difficult time</text>
  <text start="323.569" dur="4.981">getting people to spend their money you</text>
  <text start="325.879" dur="4.741">know why because they really didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="328.55" dur="4.049">that much to spend and this is why</text>
  <text start="330.62" dur="4.069">people always turn to credit cards but</text>
  <text start="332.599" dur="6.03">when those get maxed out what happens</text>
  <text start="334.689" dur="6.22">you&amp;#39;re doomed you can&amp;#39;t spend and we can</text>
  <text start="338.629" dur="4.32">see that Motor Vehicles well parts and</text>
  <text start="340.909" dur="4.28">dealers they were down 2.4% furniture</text>
  <text start="342.949" dur="3.361">and home furnishings down 1.2%</text>
  <text start="345.189" dur="2.98">electronics</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="4.259">and applying stores down point-three</text>
  <text start="348.169" dur="5.701">percent clothing and accessories down</text>
  <text start="350.569" dur="6.78">1.3% gas stations down 2% but that might</text>
  <text start="353.87" dur="6.539">be the price of gasoline and you can see</text>
  <text start="357.349" dur="5.761">that a lot of different sectors within</text>
  <text start="360.409" dur="4.5">the retail industry they are not doing</text>
  <text start="363.11" dur="3.419">well if you look at some other things</text>
  <text start="364.909" dur="4.56">like you know food and beverage stores</text>
  <text start="366.529" dur="4.98">are up by 1.1 percent we see also</text>
  <text start="369.469" dur="5.79">miscellaneous store retailers are up by</text>
  <text start="371.509" dur="7.13">0.1 percent food and service and drink</text>
  <text start="375.259" dur="6.21">places up by 0.7 percent so the main</text>
  <text start="378.639" dur="4.93">area furniture home furnishing</text>
  <text start="381.469" dur="6.391">electronics appliance stores clothing</text>
  <text start="383.569" dur="6.75">they are all down right now and the</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="5.549">central bank realizes that people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="390.319" dur="5.011">spending there is a problem Trump</text>
  <text start="393.409" dur="4.081">understands this he understands that</text>
  <text start="395.33" dur="5.19">people aren&amp;#39;t out there spending we have</text>
  <text start="397.49" dur="5.25">a problem in this economy now Trump and</text>
  <text start="400.52" dur="4.35">the central bank I do believe they are</text>
  <text start="402.74" dur="5.429">working together now think about what</text>
  <text start="404.87" dur="6.479">has happened Trump has been manipulating</text>
  <text start="408.169" dur="5.55">the statistical numbers just like Obama</text>
  <text start="411.349" dur="5.551">and the rest of the presidents did</text>
  <text start="413.719" dur="5.67">before him I actually during Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.9" dur="4.53">turn they went completely crazy with the</text>
  <text start="419.389" dur="4.05">manipulation to make the economy look a</text>
  <text start="421.43" dur="3.449">lot better than it really was Trump just</text>
  <text start="423.439" dur="3.391">took this and said you know what let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.879" dur="3.751">put this into overdrive and we could see</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="4.11">the stock market GDP unemployment and he</text>
  <text start="428.63" dur="3.809">did this on purpose because he knew this</text>
  <text start="430.94" dur="3.089">was the only way to combat</text>
  <text start="432.439" dur="3.93">the mainstream media the deep state the</text>
  <text start="434.029" dur="4.11">central banks by showing everyone that</text>
  <text start="436.369" dur="4.59">the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="438.139" dur="4.59">remember the central bank used to look</text>
  <text start="440.959" dur="3.99">at these numbers they used to look at</text>
  <text start="442.729" dur="4.89">the market they used to look at</text>
  <text start="444.949" dur="6.17">unemployment they used to look at GDP</text>
  <text start="447.619" dur="9.42">numbers and something very interesting</text>
  <text start="451.119" dur="9.55">just happened Pawel right now says he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="457.039" dur="6.3">going to be looking at retail to see how</text>
  <text start="460.669" dur="5.79">retail and how the sales data how that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.339" dur="5.82">going to look moving forward and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="466.459" dur="5.52">use that to decide if we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="469.159" dur="4.68">raise rates or not now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="471.979" dur="5.97">interesting because we know that retail</text>
  <text start="473.839" dur="7.08">is not doing well I believe the central</text>
  <text start="477.949" dur="5.67">bank is using this as a cover story to</text>
  <text start="480.919" dur="5.31">explain why they shouldn&amp;#39;t be raising</text>
  <text start="483.619" dur="5.28">rates right now and this is being done</text>
  <text start="486.229" dur="4.17">on purpose if we go back to Q&amp;#39;s posts</text>
  <text start="488.899" dur="4.74">about how they were going to raise rates</text>
  <text start="490.399" dur="4.77">in 2019 this would be a perfect cover</text>
  <text start="493.639" dur="2.76">story well we&amp;#39;re gonna be a little bit</text>
  <text start="495.169" dur="3.9">patient right now we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="496.399" dur="5.37">retail retail is not doing that well but</text>
  <text start="499.069" dur="5.37">in the meantime Trump is manipulating</text>
  <text start="501.769" dur="4.86">the statistical numbers unemployment GDP</text>
  <text start="504.439" dur="4.53">and the rest so right now</text>
  <text start="506.629" dur="4.59">Trump controls the narrative with the</text>
  <text start="508.969" dur="4.05">statistical numbers he has the central</text>
  <text start="511.219" dur="3.6">bank saying listen we&amp;#39;re not gonna be</text>
  <text start="513.019" dur="5.33">raising rates right now because of</text>
  <text start="514.819" dur="7.53">retail he&amp;#39;s controlling the entire</text>
  <text start="518.349" dur="9.18">narrative of the central bank and the</text>

  <text start="638.64" dur="5.43">that is one part of the swamp what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="642.15" dur="5.07">also doing is he&amp;#39;s cutting off the</text>
  <text start="644.07" dur="5.34">funding for all these individuals</text>
  <text start="647.22" dur="5.16">Planned Parenthood and all these other</text>
  <text start="649.41" dur="6.33">programs that we listed here because how</text>
  <text start="652.38" dur="6.51">do you get rid of the deep state you cut</text>
  <text start="655.74" dur="5.37">off their funding so you need to shut</text>
  <text start="658.89" dur="4.26">all these programs down and also if</text>
  <text start="661.11" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re gonna head into a transition what</text>
  <text start="663.15" dur="3.42">do you need to do you need to cut costs</text>
  <text start="665.31" dur="4.2">you need to get people off the</text>
  <text start="666.57" dur="6.9">government programs this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="669.51" dur="6.39">Trump is doing right now and later on</text>
  <text start="673.47" dur="5.94">what he&amp;#39;s going to do he&amp;#39;s gonna shut</text>
  <text start="675.9" dur="6">down the money printing center of the</text>
  <text start="679.41" dur="5.97">deep state which is the central bank</text>
  <text start="681.9" dur="5.91">system and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="685.38" dur="4.829">that economists and central banks around</text>
  <text start="687.81" dur="4.77">the world we&amp;#39;ve been saying this for</text>
  <text start="690.209" dur="5.101">quite a while they are completely</text>
  <text start="692.58" dur="6.21">exposed right now and we can see that</text>
  <text start="695.31" dur="3.96">they have no place to hide so what are</text>
  <text start="698.79" dur="4.23">they doing</text>
  <text start="699.27" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re cutting their global forecast</text>
  <text start="703.02" dur="6">now economists they&amp;#39;re saying this has</text>
  <text start="706.14" dur="5.55">taken us by surprise I can&amp;#39;t believe how</text>
  <text start="709.02" dur="5.67">the global economy is slowing them yes</text>
  <text start="711.69" dur="6.269">the central bank system cannot operate</text>
  <text start="714.69" dur="5.399">under these conditions and this is why</text>
  <text start="717.959" dur="4.591">they normally have an event and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="720.089" dur="5.31">know why everyone&amp;#39;s so surprised we knew</text>
  <text start="722.55" dur="4.56">this was going to happen so economists</text>
  <text start="725.399" dur="5.641">are looking at this and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="727.11" dur="6.87">yeah this is not doing well and they are</text>
  <text start="731.04" dur="6.66">lowering their outlook on global growth</text>
  <text start="733.98" dur="6.57">the OECD join the IMF in slashing its</text>
  <text start="737.7" dur="5.46">2019 growth forecast cutting its</text>
  <text start="740.55" dur="4.65">projections to its aggregate global</text>
  <text start="743.16" dur="4.35">growth to just about one percent just</text>
  <text start="745.2" dur="4.889">over half of its previous outlook of 1.8</text>
  <text start="747.51" dur="7.019">percent Jerome Powell is out there</text>
  <text start="750.089" dur="7.201">though saying the US economy well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="754.529" dur="4.201">in a good place and it looks pretty darn</text>
  <text start="757.29" dur="4.56">good if you look at all the economic</text>
  <text start="758.73" dur="6.9">data so Trump is making the United</text>
  <text start="761.85" dur="8.609">States look incredible so it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="765.63" dur="7.97">shining light standing tall around the</text>
  <text start="770.459" dur="9.091">entire world where the entire world</text>
  <text start="773.6" dur="10.92">Europe Asia they&amp;#39;re all not doing well</text>
  <text start="779.55" dur="10.2">and I believe the plan is is to expose</text>
  <text start="784.52" dur="7.629">the central bank system while keeping</text>
  <text start="789.75" dur="4.38">the economy looking fantastic and</text>
  <text start="792.149" dur="4.041">there&amp;#39;s reasons for that because he</text>
  <text start="794.13" dur="6.63">needs to get reelected first of all</text>
  <text start="796.19" dur="7.69">secondly he needs to transition this</text>
  <text start="800.76" dur="4.769">whole entire system into something</text>
  <text start="803.88" dur="3.329">completely different remember there are</text>
  <text start="805.529" dur="4.05">many countries out there that are still</text>
  <text start="807.209" dur="4.201">controlled by the deep state the</text>
  <text start="809.579" dur="3.57">unelected leaders and even the people</text>
  <text start="811.41" dur="3.63">that are elected they are still working</text>
  <text start="813.149" dur="3.781">with the deep state and if you notice a</text>
  <text start="815.04" dur="4.62">lot of these leaders they are now</text>
  <text start="816.93" dur="4.05">resigning from their positions they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="819.66" dur="4.89">saying they&amp;#39;re not going to run for</text>
  <text start="820.98" dur="6.51">re-election may Merkel many others Acron</text>
  <text start="824.55" dur="5.52">he&amp;#39;s having his own problems and we see</text>
  <text start="827.49" dur="4.95">the UK with the brexit they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="830.07" dur="5.94">break away from the</text>
  <text start="832.44" dur="6.72">central bank system the people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="836.01" dur="5.01">want to be associated with the EU and of</text>
  <text start="839.16" dur="4.59">course the central bankers will not have</text>
  <text start="841.02" dur="6.12">this because if or when the UK breaks</text>
  <text start="843.75" dur="5.58">away there goes the EU because many</text>
  <text start="847.14" dur="5.16">other countries are going to follow in</text>
  <text start="849.33" dur="5.01">the footsteps of the UK and if you look</text>
  <text start="852.3" dur="4.74">at many of the EU countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="854.34" dur="4.32">already saying to the EU listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="857.04" dur="3.54">not going along with their immigration</text>
  <text start="858.66" dur="3.87">policies so if they&amp;#39;re not going along</text>
  <text start="860.58" dur="4.25">with that what do you think is gonna</text>
  <text start="862.53" dur="4.23">happen once the brexit goes through</text>
  <text start="864.83" dur="2.83">they&amp;#39;re all gonna look at this and say</text>
  <text start="866.76" dur="3.15">wait a minute</text>
  <text start="867.66" dur="4.29">UK is doing pretty darn good the EU is</text>
  <text start="869.91" dur="3.81">hurting and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="871.95" dur="4.68">complete and utter disaster for the EU</text>
  <text start="873.72" dur="4.71">and they know this and I believe the</text>
  <text start="876.63" dur="4.83">plan that Trump is working on with many</text>
  <text start="878.43" dur="5.52">other nations it&amp;#39;s to bring down the</text>
  <text start="881.46" dur="5.79">central bank system to expose them</text>
  <text start="883.95" dur="4.86">worldwide and then expose it here in the</text>
  <text start="887.25" dur="3.6">United States actually if you think</text>
  <text start="888.81" dur="5.91">about it what if the central bankers do</text>
  <text start="890.85" dur="5.91">in the past they brought down the global</text>
  <text start="894.72" dur="3.72">economy first like if you go back to the</text>
  <text start="896.76" dur="4.38">Great Depression they brought down the</text>
  <text start="898.44" dur="4.05">global economy first and then it hit the</text>
  <text start="901.14" dur="4.32">United States the United States went</text>
  <text start="902.49" dur="5.25">into a depression Trump is almost using</text>
  <text start="905.46" dur="4.68">the same exact strategy the United</text>
  <text start="907.74" dur="4.56">States is looking fantastic and the</text>
  <text start="910.14" dur="5.19">global community is having a problem</text>
  <text start="912.3" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re going to collapse and the United</text>
  <text start="915.33" dur="3.27">States is going to look pretty darn good</text>
  <text start="917.16" dur="3.57">and then eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="918.6" dur="3.42">happen most likely is that Trump is</text>
  <text start="920.73" dur="3.09">going to have the Fed start to raise</text>
  <text start="922.02" dur="4.47">rates of course it&amp;#39;s going to be after</text>
  <text start="923.82" dur="4.38">the 2020 election they&amp;#39;re going to raise</text>
  <text start="926.49" dur="3.15">rates he&amp;#39;s going to point the finger</text>
  <text start="928.2" dur="2.88">point the finger point the finger point</text>
  <text start="929.64" dur="3">the finger saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="931.08" dur="3.03">responsible for this look every time</text>
  <text start="932.64" dur="4.86">they raise the rates something happens</text>
  <text start="934.11" dur="6.63">and the economy will completely implode</text>
  <text start="937.5" dur="5.28">on itself and everyone around the world</text>
  <text start="940.74" dur="5.13">will be looking at the Fed will be</text>
  <text start="942.78" dur="5.61">looking at the ECB and the world is</text>
  <text start="945.87" dur="4.41">going to say you know something we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="948.39" dur="5.37">want this anymore we don&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="950.28" dur="6.84">private central bank handling the</text>
  <text start="953.76" dur="5.55">creation of currency and everyone is</text>
  <text start="957.12" dur="4.74">going to wake up when this happens</text>
  <text start="959.31" dur="4.59">because I do believe we need a crisis</text>
  <text start="961.86" dur="4.29">because when you hit people in the</text>
  <text start="963.9" dur="5.58">wallet guess what</text>

  <text start="977.94" dur="6.75">understands who&amp;#39;s responsible for what</text>
  <text start="981.51" dur="6.78">happened and I believe Trump and other</text>
