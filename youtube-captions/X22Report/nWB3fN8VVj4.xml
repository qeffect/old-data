  <text start="174.989" dur="6.75">they are preparing for this event</text>
  <text start="178.56" dur="5.009">because this economy cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="181.739" dur="4.65">because you can see what&amp;#39;s happening the</text>
  <text start="183.569" dur="4.381">United States with the central bankers</text>
  <text start="186.389" dur="5.731">and the private western central bank</text>

  <text start="202.5" dur="12">I&amp;#39;m talking about Iraq Libya Lebanon</text>
  <text start="206.4" dur="11.489">Yemen Thailand in Africa Sudan Central</text>
  <text start="214.5" dur="5.549">Africa mally we can see this is what</text>
  <text start="217.889" dur="4.291">they are doing and they are losing the</text>
  <text start="220.049" dur="4.86">battle in many of these places and we</text>
  <text start="222.18" dur="5.25">look at Iraq they are losing footing in</text>
  <text start="224.909" dur="5.851">Iraq if we look at Libya they are losing</text>
  <text start="227.43" dur="6">footing in Libya Ukraine is not going</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="5.46">the way they wanted it to go they are</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="4.769">losing footing in the Ukraine so again</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="4.019">they understand what is happening they</text>
  <text start="238.199" dur="4.38">understand that the dollar cannot</text>
  <text start="240.239" dur="6.18">continually to operate the way it is and</text>
  <text start="242.579" dur="6.09">they understand that the u1 is now being</text>
  <text start="246.419" dur="4.261">slated as the reserve currency and they</text>
  <text start="248.669" dur="6.99">will not let this happen they&amp;#39;d rather</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="7.5">start a war and hold a false flag before</text>
  <text start="255.659" dur="4.8">they allow another currency be the</text>
  <text start="258.18" dur="3.779">reserve currency of the world and this</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="3.691">is what is happening but let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="8.041">the economic collapse news and will lead</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="9.36">up to why Iran and Russia or might be</text>
  <text start="270" dur="6.39">combining forces to bring down the u.s.</text>
  <text start="273.51" dur="5.64">me now out in Cyprus what is happening</text>
  <text start="276.39" dur="5.55">as they tried to pass a privatization</text>
  <text start="279.15" dur="8.94">bill and that kind of failed and they</text>
  <text start="281.94" dur="9.45">they didn&amp;#39;t pass it but just now parl</text>
  <text start="288.09" dur="7.94">the parliament passed the critical bill</text>
  <text start="291.39" dur="7.59">for their bailout and they did this on</text>
  <text start="296.03" dur="5.02">Tuesday 30 politicians in the 56 member</text>
  <text start="298.98" dur="6.72">Parliament endorsed a guideline for</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="7.13">asset sales Cyprus must raise 1.3 1.93</text>
  <text start="305.7" dur="4.53">billion dollars from private</text>
  <text start="308.18" dur="4.3">privatizations as condition of the</text>
  <text start="310.23" dur="4.35">bailout or rescue money will not be</text>
  <text start="312.48" dur="4.44">distributed so again they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="4.02">selling the assets of the country again</text>
  <text start="316.92" dur="3.12">here are the central bankers there</text>
  <text start="318.6" dur="3.27">looting the country this is what they</text>
  <text start="320.04" dur="4.68">want they want to go into these</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="6.63">countries loot the country and give them</text>
  <text start="324.72" dur="6.54">paper and ink and again they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="328.5" dur="4.5">ratchet up and continually give Cyprus</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="3.87">more and more debt just like they have</text>
  <text start="333" dur="4.32">done with Greece and this is not going</text>
  <text start="335.13" dur="4.32">to help because they have huge</text>
  <text start="337.32" dur="4.59">unemployment problem they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="339.45" dur="4.32">have huge interest payments they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.91" dur="4.05">going to need more debt they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="343.77" dur="4.11">need more austerity and again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="3.93">going to end up like Greece they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="347.88" dur="4.53">going to end up like Spain they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="349.89" dur="4.38">to end up like Italy it will not work</text>
  <text start="352.41" dur="3.96">because this cannot be sustained and we</text>
  <text start="354.27" dur="4.41">have to remember in Cyprus they still</text>
  <text start="356.37" dur="5.13">have capital controls on the people they</text>
  <text start="358.68" dur="4.32">have not relieved the amount of money</text>
  <text start="361.5" dur="3.06">that the people could withdraw from</text>
  <text start="363" dur="3.78">there comes yes they can transfer a</text>
  <text start="364.56" dur="4.8">little bit more from bank to bank but if</text>
  <text start="366.78" dur="4.26">someone went in there they cannot go up</text>
  <text start="369.36" dur="3.81">there and say listen I like my hundred</text>
  <text start="371.04" dur="3.75">thousand dollars they are just not</text>
  <text start="373.17" dur="4.86">allowed to do that at this point and</text>
  <text start="374.79" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;re already into March of 2014 so</text>
  <text start="378.03" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re moving over a year now of capital</text>
  <text start="380.7" dur="3.45">controls and we have to remember they</text>
  <text start="382.41" dur="4.29">told us that capital controls would only</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="5.67">be like a and maybe two weeks maybe four</text>
  <text start="386.7" dur="5.52">weeks maybe three months all right now</text>
  <text start="389.82" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s over a year and again they started</text>
  <text start="392.22" dur="2.73">out with the bail in saying that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="393.57" dur="3.33">only going to take eight to ten percent</text>
  <text start="394.95" dur="3.81">and they ended up taking forty seven</text>
  <text start="396.9" dur="4.62">percent and this is what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="398.76" dur="5.58">see here in the US and in other</text>
  <text start="401.52" dur="5.91">countries like Canada Australia the</text>
  <text start="404.34" dur="7.05">eurozone Switzerland because they all</text>
  <text start="407.43" dur="6.27">have the same ballon document these were</text>
  <text start="411.39" dur="4.59">created on purpose because that on</text>
  <text start="413.7" dur="4.62">purpose because they understand when</text>
  <text start="415.98" dur="4.47">this collapse comes they the</text>
  <text start="418.32" dur="4.83">government&amp;#39;s will no longer bailout</text>
  <text start="420.45" dur="5.85">these banks so they need to look inward</text>
  <text start="423.15" dur="5.7">and take the money from the people and</text>
  <text start="426.3" dur="5.72">this is why everyone that is in a bank</text>
  <text start="428.85" dur="6.39">is no longer a depositor they are now a</text>
  <text start="432.02" dur="5.8">creditor look at your terms of service</text>
  <text start="435.24" dur="5.94">of these banks and you will also see</text>
  <text start="437.82" dur="5.52">they added other terms in there where</text>
  <text start="441.18" dur="5.34">they are not responsible or can help can</text>
  <text start="443.34" dur="5.97">be held liable for cyber attacks wore</text>
  <text start="446.52" dur="4.26">false flag events and those type of</text>
  <text start="449.31" dur="3.69">things and if you really look at the</text>
  <text start="450.78" dur="5.13">Terms of Service and read it you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="453" dur="5.43">hold the officers the employees of the</text>
  <text start="455.91" dur="6.6">bank you just lose your money and that</text>
  <text start="458.43" dur="7.62">is it and if you&amp;#39;re depending on the</text>
  <text start="462.51" dur="7.41">FDIC the FDIC does not have enough money</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="5.94">to cover every single bank when this</text>
  <text start="469.92" dur="6.54">bail-in comes it&amp;#39;s just impossible they</text>
  <text start="471.99" dur="6.54">cannot do it okay now in the news</text>
  <text start="476.46" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re saying that auto loans amounts</text>
  <text start="478.53" dur="4.44">hit a new record high and they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="480.51" dur="6.36">well look auto sales or it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="482.97" dur="6.18">better we&amp;#39;re loaning people more money</text>
  <text start="486.87" dur="4.56">but if we really break this down and see</text>
  <text start="489.15" dur="5.67">what&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s really not what</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re what they&amp;#39;re saying those with</text>
  <text start="494.82" dur="4.68">non-prime credit ratings or credit</text>
  <text start="497.07" dur="5.04">scores between 620 and 679 had the</text>
  <text start="499.5" dur="5.79">highest average auto loan because you</text>
  <text start="502.11" dur="5.04">know as your credit is not as good as</text>
  <text start="505.29" dur="6.03">someone else&amp;#39;s and you have a credit</text>
  <text start="507.15" dur="7.65">score between 626 7679 you have to pay</text>
  <text start="511.32" dur="5.58">more money and not surprisingly those</text>
  <text start="514.8" dur="4.92">with subprime credit ratings credit</text>
  <text start="516.9" dur="4.95">scores between 550 and 619 had the</text>
  <text start="519.72" dur="4.44">highest average monthly payments and</text>
  <text start="521.85" dur="4.44">this is what has been happening because</text>
  <text start="524.16" dur="4.95">they opened up the auto industry to</text>
  <text start="526.29" dur="6">subprime borrowers because they needed</text>
  <text start="529.11" dur="4.5">more people to purchase the automobiles</text>
  <text start="532.29" dur="3.99">and of course these people are paying</text>
  <text start="533.61" dur="5.82">more money per month and what happens is</text>
  <text start="536.28" dur="4.95">it drives up the amount of auto loans</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="4.86">and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="541.23" dur="6.09">and again for people to afford these</text>
  <text start="544.29" dur="5.34">cars they have extended the auto loans</text>
  <text start="547.32" dur="4.71">from six I mean I remember one there</text>
  <text start="549.63" dur="5.04">were four years than five years we&amp;#39;re up</text>
  <text start="552.03" dur="4.65">to seven to eight years now they have</text>
  <text start="554.67" dur="4.86">extended them so long because people</text>
  <text start="556.68" dur="5.43">cannot afford these high price</text>
  <text start="559.53" dur="5.19">automobiles especially on the incomes</text>
  <text start="562.11" dur="4.53">that everyone is making and again income</text>
  <text start="564.72" dur="2.94">has not kept up with inflation even</text>
  <text start="566.64" dur="3.08">though the government tells us there is</text>
  <text start="567.66" dur="4.62">no inflation but we see it everywhere</text>
  <text start="569.72" dur="3.87">income has actually been falling those</text>
  <text start="572.28" dur="4.83">people who have had a full time job</text>
  <text start="573.59" dur="5.47">making a certain income got laid off now</text>
  <text start="577.11" dur="3.96">look for another full-time job they are</text>
  <text start="579.06" dur="4.56">making less money or those people are</text>
  <text start="581.07" dur="3.96">making less money in one two or three</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="3.63">part-time jobs and they need an</text>
  <text start="585.03" dur="5.34">automobile to get to work they have to</text>
  <text start="587.25" dur="6.42">pay these higher payments because they</text>
  <text start="590.37" dur="6.87">cannot afford these cars and they need</text>
  <text start="593.67" dur="5.79">to stretch out the loans to for a longer</text>
  <text start="597.24" dur="4.65">period so their payments are lower but</text>
  <text start="599.46" dur="4.59">in the end they&amp;#39;re actually paying more</text>
  <text start="601.89" dur="4.32">money now they keep telling us that the</text>
  <text start="604.05" dur="4.59">economy is getting better everything</text>
  <text start="606.21" dur="6.21">looks great but there are more and more</text>
  <text start="608.64" dur="6.39">store closing being thrown out at being</text>
  <text start="612.42" dur="5.13">thrown at us and we are seeing that a</text>
  <text start="615.03" dur="5.16">hundred and forty five brown shoes which</text>
  <text start="617.55" dur="6.96">is a famous footwear they&amp;#39;re closing 145</text>
  <text start="620.19" dur="6.3">stores target is closing 12 more stores</text>
  <text start="624.51" dur="3.36">and this is because the economy is</text>
  <text start="626.49" dur="4.2">recovering and we&amp;#39;re doing better no</text>
  <text start="627.87" dur="6.78">it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s because the people do not</text>
  <text start="630.69" dur="7.74">have the money to shop in retail they</text>
  <text start="634.65" dur="7.02">just don&amp;#39;t have the money Radio Shack is</text>
  <text start="638.43" dur="5.4">closing another 1,100 stores first there</text>
  <text start="641.67" dur="5.58">was 500 now they&amp;#39;re closing additional</text>
  <text start="643.83" dur="6">1,100 why because people are not going</text>
  <text start="647.25" dur="5.01">into radio shack and purchasing goods</text>
  <text start="649.83" dur="4.14">that is the reason and of course this</text>
  <text start="652.26" dur="4.02">goes on to say radio shack plans to</text>
  <text start="653.97" dur="4.55">close up to 1100 of its own of its</text>
  <text start="656.28" dur="4.74">underperforming stores in the US and</text>
  <text start="658.52" dur="5.05">reported a wider loss for its fourth</text>
  <text start="661.02" dur="4.23">quarter as traffic slowed during the</text>
  <text start="663.57" dur="5.82">critical holiday season and we saw this</text>
  <text start="665.25" dur="7.35">in macys jcpenney Best Buy and many</text>
  <text start="669.39" dur="5.72">other stores where they did not see the</text>
  <text start="672.6" dur="5.03">traffic they started the closest store</text>
  <text start="675.11" dur="4.71">the laying off many people and this is</text>
  <text start="677.63" dur="4.23">because people are not really working</text>
  <text start="679.82" dur="3.99">and again I&amp;#39;ve said this many times we</text>
  <text start="681.86" dur="3.9">have to use common sense if the</text>
  <text start="683.81" dur="3.51">unemployment rate is truly at six point</text>
  <text start="685.76" dur="5.4">six percent and watch we&amp;#39;ll probably see</text>
  <text start="687.32" dur="7.74">a drop even further why is retail doing</text>
  <text start="691.16" dur="6.39">worse now then when unemployment was</text>
  <text start="695.06" dur="5.67">much much higher because if we go back</text>
  <text start="697.55" dur="5.4">to 2012 in 2011 unemployment was not at</text>
  <text start="700.73" dur="6.78">six point six percent unemployment was</text>
  <text start="702.95" dur="7.41">at eight percent or higher so how can</text>
  <text start="707.51" dur="5.699">retail be doing worse because the</text>
  <text start="710.36" dur="5.039">unemployment numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="713.209" dur="4.411">made-up they are manipulated and if you</text>
  <text start="715.399" dur="3.87">go back to nineteen ninety-four prior to</text>
  <text start="717.62" dur="3.42">nineteen ninety-four and do and you</text>
  <text start="719.269" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t use the manipulated numbers you</text>
  <text start="721.04" dur="4.38">can see unemployment is around thirty</text>
  <text start="723.079" dur="3.151">percent and again there are other people</text>
  <text start="725.42" dur="3.12">that are saying that&amp;#39;s around</text>
  <text start="726.23" dur="5.07">thirty-seven percent but it is very high</text>
  <text start="728.54" dur="5.07">and again the youth of America who are</text>
  <text start="731.3" dur="4.68">coming out of college cannot find the</text>
  <text start="733.61" dur="3.96">jobs they went to school for so what is</text>
  <text start="735.98" dur="3.359">happening they&amp;#39;re staying with their</text>
  <text start="737.57" dur="3.99">parents they&amp;#39;re living in their rooms</text>
  <text start="739.339" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re getting part-time work and they</text>
  <text start="741.56" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t have extra money why because their</text>
  <text start="743.839" dur="4.021">student loan payments are too high and</text>
  <text start="745.88" dur="6.03">again this is why the government is out</text>
  <text start="747.86" dur="5.46">there saying listen we&amp;#39;re going to redo</text>
  <text start="751.91" dur="3.539">your student loans we&amp;#39;re going to make</text>
  <text start="753.32" dur="6.36">it a lot easier to make payments because</text>
  <text start="755.449" dur="6.871">they realize these students don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="759.68" dur="4.23">the jobs to repay these loans and this</text>
  <text start="762.32" dur="4.35">is why they&amp;#39;re stretching them out and</text>
  <text start="763.91" dur="5.22">making special circumstances where they</text>
  <text start="766.67" dur="5.97">do not have to pay these student loans</text>
  <text start="769.13" dur="5.67">and again the youth of America is the</text>
  <text start="772.64" dur="4.319">driving force for the next generation</text>
  <text start="774.8" dur="4.59">and right now we do not have that</text>
  <text start="776.959" dur="4.861">driving force for retail we do not have</text>
  <text start="779.39" dur="3.96">that driving force for real estate</text>
  <text start="781.82" dur="4.35">because those people who are retiring</text>
  <text start="783.35" dur="6.09">are looking to sell their homes move</text>
  <text start="786.17" dur="5.31">into a smaller place or rent and they do</text>
  <text start="789.44" dur="4.889">not want to own their home anymore and</text>
  <text start="791.48" dur="5.43">again we don&amp;#39;t have that use to come up</text>
  <text start="794.329" dur="3.901">behind them and to purchase all of these</text>
  <text start="796.91" dur="4.039">homes and this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing an</text>
  <text start="798.23" dur="4.89">increase foreclosures this is why</text>
  <text start="800.949" dur="3.911">mortgage applications are starting to</text>
  <text start="803.12" dur="4.44">plunge and there are any other reasons</text>
  <text start="804.86" dur="3.51">but this this is really leading into</text>
  <text start="807.56" dur="3">this</text>
  <text start="808.37" dur="5.1">and again going back to the retail sales</text>
  <text start="810.56" dur="5.4">sbarro which is a pizza chain they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="813.47" dur="6.5">closing about a hundred and fifty five</text>
  <text start="815.96" dur="6.78">of its 400 stores in North America and</text>
  <text start="819.97" dur="5.77">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the economy</text>
  <text start="822.74" dur="5.37">has affected their business and again</text>
  <text start="825.74" dur="4.8">when the economy is affected the food</text>
  <text start="828.11" dur="4.5">industry we&amp;#39;re in trouble because that</text>
  <text start="830.54" dur="4.08">means people are not going out and going</text>
  <text start="832.61" dur="4.229">out to eat and again this is not</text>
  <text start="834.62" dur="5.03">expensive food and this means people</text>
  <text start="836.839" dur="7.261">don&amp;#39;t even have money to pay for pizza</text>
  <text start="839.65" dur="8.04">now we are seeing right now in the real</text>
  <text start="844.1" dur="7.83">estate industry we said this back in</text>
  <text start="847.69" dur="7.18">August september-october of 2013 when we</text>
  <text start="851.93" dur="4.409">saw President Obama out there saying</text>
  <text start="854.87" dur="4.02">that you know the housing market is</text>
  <text start="856.339" dur="4.761">recovering but you know if we look past</text>
  <text start="858.89" dur="7.38">that we saw wells fargo city bank chase</text>

  <text start="868.37" dur="3">thousands upon thousands of people in</text>
  <text start="870.17" dur="3.3">the mortgage departments because they</text>
  <text start="871.37" dur="3.9">understood that this is a complete</text>
  <text start="873.47" dur="3.75">bubble and we understand that most of</text>
  <text start="875.27" dur="5.759">the purchase purchase of the homes are</text>
  <text start="877.22" dur="6.05">in cash and right now a loan origination</text>
  <text start="881.029" dur="5.821">is declined to the lowest point since</text>
  <text start="883.27" dur="6.28">november of 2008 and this was november</text>
  <text start="886.85" dur="6.359">that was the start of the recession I</text>
  <text start="889.55" dur="7.44">mean this is down sixty percent home</text>
  <text start="893.209" dur="8.281">equity lending in 2013 still down over</text>
  <text start="896.99" dur="6.48">ninety percent from 2006 these declines</text>
  <text start="901.49" dur="4.11">are largely tied to the increased</text>
  <text start="903.47" dur="4.17">mortgage interest rate environment which</text>
  <text start="905.6" dur="5.01">is having a significant impact on the</text>
  <text start="907.64" dur="4.41">number bars with incentive to refinance</text>
  <text start="910.61" dur="3.21">and you&amp;#39;re telling me the interest rates</text>
  <text start="912.05" dur="3.45">are what around four percent or</text>
  <text start="913.82" dur="3.69">something like that and they take up a</text>
  <text start="915.5" dur="5.01">little bit and no one&amp;#39;s refinancing I</text>
  <text start="917.51" dur="5.51">mean the interest rates are very low at</text>
  <text start="920.51" dur="6.48">this point so what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="923.02" dur="6.31">well what they&amp;#39;re seeing is that a good</text>
  <text start="926.99" dur="4.469">deal of this dcon decline can be</text>
  <text start="929.33" dur="4.11">contributed to the fact that a majority</text>
  <text start="931.459" dur="3.781">of those who could refinance at</text>
  <text start="933.44" dur="5.46">historically low rates in recent years</text>
  <text start="935.24" dur="5.7">already have so those people who were</text>
  <text start="938.9" dur="3.34">going to refinance have already</text>
  <text start="940.94" dur="3.73">refinanced because the</text>
  <text start="942.24" dur="3.9">are very low again when they talk about</text>

  <text start="946.14" dur="5.759">percent seven percent nine percent we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="948.779" dur="6.601">at very his I mean historically low</text>

  <text start="990.54" dur="6.09">these people are just trying to get by</text>

  <text start="1007.16" dur="6.54">still purchasing them and this is all a</text>
  <text start="1010.76" dur="5.46">this is a complete ruse because what</text>
  <text start="1013.7" dur="6">they are planning to do is to show that</text>
  <text start="1016.22" dur="5.91">the economy is recovering and all of a</text>

  <text start="1032.66" dur="4.83">predictions for you all and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1034.939" dur="6.451">saying is that Obama predicts fastest</text>
  <text start="1037.49" dur="5.73">GDP growth this year since 2005 well</text>
  <text start="1041.39" dur="4.16">right now I can tell you right now they</text>
  <text start="1043.22" dur="4.53">kept on revising GDP manipulating GDP</text>
  <text start="1045.55" dur="4.3">GDP they went all the way back to</text>
  <text start="1047.75" dur="4.44">nineteen twenty-nine to include research</text>
  <text start="1049.85" dur="5.07">and development so gdp was in the</text>

  <text start="1741.59" dur="4.98">putin seems to have and this is</text>
  <text start="1743.69" dur="5.119">President Obama saying this Putin seems</text>
  <text start="1746.57" dur="5.58">to have a different set of lawyers</text>
  <text start="1748.809" dur="7.091">President Obama has a strong belief that</text>
  <text start="1752.15" dur="6.33">the Russian incursion is illegal now of</text>
  <text start="1755.9" dur="5.31">course he said belief because the</text>
  <text start="1758.48" dur="6.72">Russian invasion there is no Russian</text>
  <text start="1761.21" dur="6.829">invasion and it is legal and again they</text>
  <text start="1765.2" dur="9.15">leave out a lot of the important parts</text>
  <text start="1768.039" dur="9.101">now the Ukraine the Ukrainians out there</text>
  <text start="1774.35" dur="7.01">and in especially in Kiev their</text>
  <text start="1777.14" dur="6.779">statement that the UN that Russia has</text>

  <text start="1797.99" dur="8.7">over the place and of course what is</text>
  <text start="1801.049" dur="9.36">really happening in Crimea is that that</text>
  <text start="1806.69" dur="6.9">the Western media seems they have chosen</text>
  <text start="1810.409" dur="5.941">to ignore the fact that the Russian</text>
  <text start="1813.59" dur="5.79">troops have been stationed in Crimea for</text>
  <text start="1816.35" dur="5.73">over a decade and they also kind of left</text>

  <text start="1838.58" dur="5.94">prolonged for another 25 years so these</text>
  <text start="1841.82" dur="5.609">troops are stationed there they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1844.52" dur="5.07">invade and they aren&amp;#39;t really doing</text>
  <text start="1847.429" dur="4.651">anything they&amp;#39;re just maintaining the</text>
  <text start="1849.59" dur="4.829">peace and again we have to look at the</text>
  <text start="1852.08" dur="4.62">whole entire situation what has happened</text>
  <text start="1854.419" dur="3.831">there is that the US government along</text>
  <text start="1856.7" dur="4.53">with the central bankers and the EU</text>
  <text start="1858.25" dur="5.98">decided to paid agent provocateurs and</text>
  <text start="1861.23" dur="6.09">they spent quite a bit of money to push</text>
  <text start="1864.23" dur="6.59">this agenda forward now the opposition</text>
  <text start="1867.32" dur="5.969">and the Ukrainian government at the time</text>
  <text start="1870.82" dur="4.489">what happened was they came up with this</text>
  <text start="1873.289" dur="4.36">deal they both signed to Germany France</text>
  <text start="1875.309" dur="3.781">us approved it and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1877.649" dur="4.11">the opposition went back on the deal</text>
  <text start="1879.09" dur="4.919">went into the government and threw them</text>
  <text start="1881.759" dur="4.38">out and everyone escaped and they took</text>

  <text start="2135.02" dur="6.839">America more so than Russia and we have</text>
  <text start="2139.339" dur="6.541">to remember this that Russia and</text>
  <text start="2141.859" dur="6.15">China hold a lot of Treasuries and of</text>
  <text start="2145.88" dur="5.639">course the russian presidential advisor</text>

  <text start="2165.68" dur="5.25">encourage everybody including China to</text>
  <text start="2168.859" dur="4.41">dump us treasury bonds get rid of</text>
  <text start="2170.93" dur="7.26">dollars as an unreliable currency and</text>
  <text start="2173.269" dur="6.48">leave the US market if this happened</text>
  <text start="2178.19" dur="6.079">which I don&amp;#39;t believe at this time it</text>
  <text start="2179.749" dur="9.661">will but if it did this would bring the</text>
  <text start="2184.269" dur="8.08">US economy to its need its knees the Fed</text>
  <text start="2189.41" dur="6.149">would have to increase quantitative</text>
  <text start="2192.349" dur="5.821">easing like you&amp;#39;ve never seen before to</text>
  <text start="2195.559" dur="5.19">purchase all of these Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="2198.17" dur="8.339">because you have to remember China holds</text>
  <text start="2200.749" dur="8.191">between 1.2 and 1.3 billion dollars were</text>
  <text start="2206.509" dur="6.211">I think I&amp;#39;m sorry trillion dollars worth</text>
  <text start="2208.94" dur="9.24">of Treasury bonds and russia holds about</text>
  <text start="2212.72" dur="9.389">200 billion so this would be really</text>
  <text start="2218.18" dur="7.23">really horrific for the United States</text>
  <text start="2222.109" dur="5.581">and again most of this is because they</text>
  <text start="2225.41" dur="4.53">are using propaganda and of course they</text>
  <text start="2227.69" dur="3.839">always say sanctions they owe because</text>
  <text start="2229.94" dur="3.569">they&amp;#39;re trying anything they possibly</text>
  <text start="2231.529" dur="4.83">can at this point because they do not</text>
  <text start="2233.509" dur="4.02">like what is happening in Russia they</text>
  <text start="2236.359" dur="4.2">thought they were just going to go in</text>
  <text start="2237.529" dur="5.641">take over kiev and i thought they would</text>
  <text start="2240.559" dur="5.131">have the entire ukraine and everyone</text>
  <text start="2243.17" dur="6.03">would be happy but most of the most of</text>
  <text start="2245.69" dur="6.75">ukraine is not happy and we can see that</text>
  <text start="2249.2" dur="7.68">most of the people there are not really</text>
  <text start="2252.44" dur="7.859">interested in the EU or what the Western</text>
  <text start="2256.88" dur="6.09">governments want you to believe and we</text>
  <text start="2260.299" dur="5.161">can see that it is a oppositional force</text>
  <text start="2262.97" dur="4.799">we can see they were paid we can see</text>
  <text start="2265.46" dur="4.289">this was all completely planned from all</text>
  <text start="2267.769" dur="4.83">the evidence that we&amp;#39;ve seen and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2269.749" dur="4.421">seen this all before back in Syria with</text>
  <text start="2272.599" dur="3.521">the false flag</text>
  <text start="2274.17" dur="3.21">and we&amp;#39;ve seen the US government and the</text>

  <text start="2277.38" dur="4.8">western central bank countries do this</text>

  <text start="2282.18" dur="7.44">Iraq weapons of mass destruction Lebanon</text>
  <text start="2286.32" dur="8.01">Libya Yemen I mean we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="2289.62" dur="7.17">before this is nothing new now of course</text>
  <text start="2294.33" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s propaganda out there and I</text>
  <text start="2296.79" dur="4.5">mentioned this a couple reports ago and</text>
  <text start="2298.59" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s resurfacing that US intelligence is</text>
  <text start="2301.29" dur="5.93">tracking movements of Russian commandos</text>
  <text start="2303.27" dur="6.45">near Ukraine and again earlier this week</text>
  <text start="2307.22" dur="4.87">they said that they were tracking people</text>
  <text start="2309.72" dur="4.41">and they&amp;#39;re seeing that you know US</text>
  <text start="2312.09" dur="4.71">intelligence agencies also are tracking</text>
  <text start="2314.13" dur="5.1">possible covert infiltration of Russian</text>
  <text start="2316.8" dur="4.95">commandos one concern and this is the</text>
  <text start="2319.23" dur="5.13">concern they have is that that Moscow</text>
  <text start="2321.75" dur="5.46">will provoke a conflict by using the</text>
  <text start="2324.36" dur="5.07">undercover commandos to attack ethnic</text>
  <text start="2327.21" dur="4.41">Russians and then launch an invasion</text>
  <text start="2329.43" dur="5.4">under the guise of protecting those</text>
  <text start="2331.62" dur="5.46">Russians well I really don&amp;#39;t think this</text>
  <text start="2334.83" dur="5.19">is going to happen I believe this is all</text>
  <text start="2337.08" dur="5.34">propaganda maybe the opposition forces</text>
  <text start="2340.02" dur="3.93">will do this to make it look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2342.42" dur="3.78">coming from Russia but there is</text>
  <text start="2343.95" dur="4.89">absolutely no reason for Russia to do</text>
