  <text start="150.38" dur="2.85">we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about that in</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="4.59">just a little bit but let&amp;#39;s first go</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="5.16">with combing with Daniel read Daniel</text>
  <text start="156.35" dur="4.47">Richmond right here he is the Columbia</text>
  <text start="158.39" dur="6.78">Law professor where Comey handed off his</text>
  <text start="160.82" dur="7.229">memos to this attorney which then leaked</text>
  <text start="165.17" dur="6.02">it to the corporate media we find out</text>
  <text start="168.049" dur="6.06">that professor Daniel Richmond well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.19" dur="6.07">supposedly a special government employee</text>
  <text start="174.109" dur="5.16">for commis FBI on an unpaid basis now</text>
  <text start="177.26" dur="5.069">this is very interesting because</text>
  <text start="179.269" dur="6.06">Richmond is saying I did indeed have sge</text>
  <text start="182.329" dur="4.471">status with the bureau for no pay and he</text>
  <text start="185.329" dur="3.991">wrote this in an email</text>
  <text start="186.8" dur="4.65">so if he had special access why did he</text>
  <text start="189.32" dur="4.74">make the media rounds and not state he</text>
  <text start="191.45" dur="6.51">had that or that he was commies attorney</text>
  <text start="194.06" dur="6.6">if he was sge he&amp;#39;s just as much as fault</text>
  <text start="197.96" dur="3.75">for leaking as Comey now so here a</text>
  <text start="200.66" dur="3.42">couple questions that need to be</text>
  <text start="201.71" dur="4.8">answered when did Richmond get the s GE</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="4.95">status when was Richmond hired as</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="5.85">commies attorney what cases did Richmond</text>
  <text start="209.03" dur="6.57">have access to what was his clearance</text>

  <text start="276.89" dur="4.68">which has not become part of the body of</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="6.06">public information so Comey when he was</text>
  <text start="281.57" dur="6.18">under oath never disclosed he was a</text>
  <text start="285.2" dur="5.82">special government employee when did he</text>
  <text start="287.75" dur="5.82">get that status Comey testified that he</text>
  <text start="291.02" dur="4.95">asked a good friend of mine who is a</text>
  <text start="293.57" dur="4.95">professor at Columbia Law School to</text>
  <text start="295.97" dur="4.56">provide the contents of a memo to an</text>
  <text start="298.52" dur="4.38">unnamed reporter he didn&amp;#39;t identify</text>
  <text start="300.53" dur="4.92">Richmond to the committee he never</text>
  <text start="302.9" dur="5.91">mentioned this and Richmond who was an</text>
  <text start="305.45" dur="5.46">SG handed over the information hmm seems</text>
  <text start="308.81" dur="6.03">to be a problem with this we see that</text>
  <text start="310.91" dur="7.35">the FEC records indicate that Hillary</text>
  <text start="314.84" dur="5.52">Clinton her campaign illegally laundered</text>
  <text start="318.26" dur="5.04">84 million</text>
  <text start="320.36" dur="5.369">dollars now the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="323.3" dur="4.98">haven&amp;#39;t taken any notice to this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.729" dur="6.15">not even looking at this and this was</text>
  <text start="328.28" dur="6.659">filed in federal court last week the</text>
  <text start="331.879" dur="4.771">lawsuit filed last week in a DC district</text>
  <text start="334.939" dur="3.45">court summarizes the DNC Clinton</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="4.019">conspiracy and provides detailed</text>
  <text start="338.389" dur="5.571">evidence from the Federal Election</text>
  <text start="340.669" dur="6.18">Commission filings confirming the</text>
  <text start="343.96" dur="5.59">complaints allegation that Democrats</text>
  <text start="346.849" dur="5.19">undertook an extensive scheme to violate</text>
  <text start="349.55" dur="5.01">federal campaign limits now you would</text>
  <text start="352.039" dur="4.201">think since this has been filed that the</text>
  <text start="354.56" dur="3.24">corporate media would be investigating</text>
  <text start="356.24" dur="4.019">all of this but they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="357.8" dur="5.13">anything why because again they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="360.259" dur="5.731">mouthpiece for the deep state we see</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="4.889">that there&amp;#39;s hundreds of migrants headed</text>
  <text start="365.99" dur="3.69">our way now we know that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="367.819" dur="4.44">pushed up from South America through</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="5.22">Mexico a lot of them is dispersed but</text>
  <text start="372.259" dur="5.701">there&amp;#39;s still a handful that are now on</text>
  <text start="374.9" dur="6.15">the border of Texas and we know that</text>
  <text start="377.96" dur="5.459">this is going to go up against Trump and</text>
  <text start="381.05" dur="4.919">I think this is being done on purpose to</text>
  <text start="383.419" dur="4.17">put a lot of pressure on Trump right now</text>
  <text start="385.969" dur="4.2">the Department of Homeland Security and</text>
  <text start="387.589" dur="5.341">the border guards they have orders to</text>
  <text start="390.169" dur="5.041">arrest people who are crossing the</text>
  <text start="392.93" dur="3.75">border illegally now of course some</text>
  <text start="395.21" dur="3.179">people are saying that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="396.68" dur="4.65">crossing the border illegally they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.389" dur="4.801">looking for asylum well if they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="401.33" dur="4.079">that they have to go through the proper</text>
  <text start="403.19" dur="4.289">channels and they have to make their</text>
  <text start="405.409" dur="3.54">case they just don&amp;#39;t get on a bus and</text>
  <text start="407.479" dur="3.601">they&amp;#39;re not just delivered to a</text>
  <text start="408.949" dur="3.9">sanctuary city like they&amp;#39;ve done in the</text>
  <text start="411.08" dur="4.079">past so if they want to go through that</text>
  <text start="412.849" dur="4.201">process that&amp;#39;s not a problem they just</text>
  <text start="415.159" dur="3.48">have to prove it all and they have to</text>
  <text start="417.05" dur="3.419">give all their information and things</text>
  <text start="418.639" dur="4.71">like that so there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="420.469" dur="5.281">standoff on the borders and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="423.349" dur="5.82">have to watch to see how this unfolds we</text>
  <text start="425.75" dur="5.58">see out in North Korea both leaders moon</text>

  <text start="460.65" dur="5.4">there is peace in this area and we know</text>
  <text start="464.22" dur="3.93">that the deep state does not like this</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="4.98">and what the deep state likes to do is</text>
  <text start="468.15" dur="4.59">they like to go from area to area well</text>
  <text start="471.03" dur="3.569">North Korea didn&amp;#39;t work out we couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="472.74" dur="5.489">get the war started there let&amp;#39;s move on</text>
  <text start="474.599" dur="5.731">to hmm maybe Syria maybe Iran and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.229" dur="4.081">what we see happening right now now</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="4.23">Russia they&amp;#39;re going to be signing a</text>
  <text start="482.31" dur="4.8">deal to supply India with s400 air</text>
  <text start="484.56" dur="3.84">defense systems this year and it looks</text>
  <text start="487.11" dur="3.809">like they&amp;#39;re going to be getting those</text>
  <text start="488.4" dur="5.479">weapons we also see out in Syria for the</text>
  <text start="490.919" dur="6">first time ever there are photographs of</text>
  <text start="493.879" dur="5.53">Russian tour m2 surface air to missile</text>
  <text start="496.919" dur="4.861">systems spotted in Syria and these</text>
  <text start="499.409" dur="4.35">Middle missile systems they are low to</text>
  <text start="501.78" dur="4.5">medium altitude short-range air defense</text>
  <text start="503.759" dur="4.051">systems designed to engage aircraft</text>
  <text start="506.28" dur="4.109">cruise missiles precision guided</text>
  <text start="507.81" dur="4.769">munitions unmanned aerial vehicles and</text>
  <text start="510.389" dur="3.991">short-range missile threats and right</text>
  <text start="512.579" dur="5.25">now we can see that these are now in</text>
  <text start="514.38" dur="7.14">Syria and Sri and Russia is looking to</text>
  <text start="517.829" dur="5.281">sell the s-300 to Syria and actually</text>
  <text start="521.52" dur="4.11">this will give them a range to hit let</text>
  <text start="523.11" dur="5.34">the airspace of Lebanon and things like</text>
  <text start="525.63" dur="5.13">that which would stop Israel from coming</text>
  <text start="528.45" dur="5.25">into or even flying around the border of</text>
  <text start="530.76" dur="5.519">this area and Israel is very angry at</text>
  <text start="533.7" dur="4.62">Russia saying listen we will destroy</text>
  <text start="536.279" dur="3.451">these missile systems which most likely</text>
  <text start="538.32" dur="3.72">they will not be able to do because</text>
  <text start="539.73" dur="3.9">their systems will intercept the</text>
  <text start="542.04" dur="3.63">missiles which they&amp;#39;ve proven over and</text>
  <text start="543.63" dur="4.74">over that they have the ability to do</text>
  <text start="545.67" dur="4.919">this now we see in Iran the Iranian</text>
  <text start="548.37" dur="4.92">naval commander they&amp;#39;re out there doing</text>
  <text start="550.589" dur="5.161">exactly what kim jung-eun did they are</text>
  <text start="553.29" dur="4.02">threatening to sink us ships and we know</text>
  <text start="555.75" dur="2.88">the USS Truman is out there and I</text>
  <text start="557.31" dur="4.23">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if there&amp;#39;s a false</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="5.31">flag where a ship maybe gets hit blames</text>
  <text start="561.54" dur="4.789">it on Iran and all of a sudden we have</text>
  <text start="563.94" dur="4.589">war kicked off here that is a</text>
  <text start="566.329" dur="5.141">possibility that could be a false flag</text>
  <text start="568.529" dur="5.131">we&amp;#39;ve seen it done before but we see</text>
  <text start="571.47" dur="3.54">Iran is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="573.66" dur="3.48">listen we&amp;#39;re going to come after the</text>
  <text start="575.01" dur="3.93">u.s. we&amp;#39;re gonna come after Israel we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.14" dur="3.53">gonna fire our missiles we&amp;#39;re pointing</text>
  <text start="578.94" dur="5.04">the missiles at all of these locations</text>
  <text start="580.67" dur="5.409">doesn&amp;#39;t this sound very similar to North</text>
  <text start="583.98" dur="2.97">Korea where they&amp;#39;re going to be bombing</text>
  <text start="586.079" dur="2.971">Chicago</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="3.6">Alaska they&amp;#39;re gonna wipe the United</text>
  <text start="589.05" dur="4.41">States off the face of the map and</text>
  <text start="590.55" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for war all</text>
  <text start="593.46" dur="7.05">that is propaganda to get the u.s. to do</text>
  <text start="597.21" dur="5.46">something it was propaganda to hopefully</text>
  <text start="600.51" dur="4.23">push a false flag which never happened</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="4.05">here we are with Iran right now and we</text>
  <text start="604.74" dur="3.45">know Q says Iran is next now I do I</text>
  <text start="606.72" dur="3.57">think there&amp;#39;s going to be regime change</text>
  <text start="608.19" dur="3.78">no I think the same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="610.29" dur="4.77">happen when two North Korea there are</text>
  <text start="611.97" dur="5.49">clowns that are integrated within the</text>
  <text start="615.06" dur="5.34">system that are controlling certain</text>
  <text start="617.46" dur="4.5">aspects of what happens in Iran and I</text>
  <text start="620.4" dur="3.45">think the mission just like in Armenia</text>
  <text start="621.96" dur="4.11">is to remove these clowns these are</text>
  <text start="623.85" dur="4.08">intelligence operatives inside the</text>
  <text start="626.07" dur="4.17">country and I think the same thing is</text>
