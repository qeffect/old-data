  <text start="140.51" dur="6.92">more people because what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="9.03">here well we&amp;#39;re seeing the slow</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="7.869">destruction of the economy this happened</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="6.39">back in two thousand seven no one wanted</text>
  <text start="155.299" dur="7.201">to admit to it it went throughout 2007</text>
  <text start="158.54" dur="5.97">into 2008 and until we had the big bang</text>
  <text start="162.5" dur="3.689">of the stock market coming down no</text>
  <text start="164.51" dur="6.089">one really wanted to admit it but</text>
  <text start="166.189" dur="7.47">remember when the market came down all</text>
  <text start="170.599" dur="6.601">of a sudden companies came out of the</text>
  <text start="173.659" dur="6.901">blue they closed a lot of them laid off</text>
  <text start="177.2" dur="6.99">a lot more people they used this as in</text>
  <text start="180.56" dur="6.149">as an excuse at this point and I believe</text>
  <text start="184.19" dur="4.379">as we go throughout this year we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="186.709" dur="4.11">going to see a lot more layoffs because</text>
  <text start="188.569" dur="5.071">corporations there&amp;#39;s no reason to keep</text>
  <text start="190.819" dur="5.81">these people if there&amp;#39;s no sales there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="193.64" dur="5.37">no revenue coming in like it once was</text>
  <text start="196.629" dur="4.631">we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot more of these</text>
  <text start="199.01" dur="4.589">layoffs and when we have this big bang</text>
  <text start="201.26" dur="3.92">of the stock market coming down we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.599" dur="3.691">going to see a lot of companies lay off</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="3.639">thousands upon thousands of people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="3.509">going to be so much worse than two</text>
  <text start="208.819" dur="3.03">thousand eight and once again I say</text>
  <text start="210.799" dur="3.451">where are these people going to find</text>
  <text start="211.849" dur="3.931">these jobs well they don&amp;#39;t exist they</text>
  <text start="214.25" dur="5.43">don&amp;#39;t exist today they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="5.4">exist at that point but we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="219.68" dur="3.27">to see a lot of other things start to</text>
  <text start="221.18" dur="3.419">fall apart now I see out in the</text>
  <text start="222.95" dur="3.45">corporate media newest governments out</text>
  <text start="224.599" dur="3.601">there saying oh existing home sales rose</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="4.38">more than expected this is incredible in</text>
  <text start="228.2" dur="7.23">March but you have to remember februari</text>
  <text start="230.78" dur="8.37">was a complete disaster and right now</text>
  <text start="235.43" dur="6.269">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a small bounce up I</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="6.69">mean year-over-year sales rose to about</text>
  <text start="241.699" dur="7.921">1.5 percent the housing market it has</text>
  <text start="245.84" dur="6.75">gone nowhere it&amp;#39;s stagnant it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="6.75">going anywhere we&amp;#39;re not seeing the</text>
  <text start="252.59" dur="7.009">growth that we once saw and when you</text>
  <text start="256.37" dur="5.82">look at this we see that the market is</text>
  <text start="259.599" dur="5.141">not going anywhere whatsoever actually I</text>
  <text start="262.19" dur="5.039">looked around the country today and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="264.74" dur="5.76">noticing now if you look at the</text>
  <text start="267.229" dur="5.641">case-shiller cities I noticed that they</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="4.949">chose certain cities because we know</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="5.31">that case shiller looks at this to pump</text>
  <text start="275.449" dur="4.321">it up now all the outlying areas and</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="4.799">this is how it started back in two</text>
  <text start="279.77" dur="5.82">thousand eight the outlying areas houses</text>
  <text start="282.979" dur="4.56">started to come down in price traffic</text>
  <text start="285.59" dur="5.25">started to dry up but the cities again</text>
  <text start="287.539" dur="4.921">it&amp;#39;s still good people are still coming</text>
  <text start="290.84" dur="2.79">but we see in the luxury market in New</text>
  <text start="292.46" dur="4.11">York City things are starting to really</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="4.819">decline at this point and then what</text>
  <text start="296.57" dur="5.48">happens it creeps inward</text>
  <text start="298.449" dur="5.52">and I&amp;#39;m seeing this outside of all these</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="6.329">areas where they say there it&amp;#39;s booming</text>
  <text start="303.969" dur="6.991">I see houses now coming down in prices</text>
  <text start="308.379" dur="4.051">now when I say coming out in prices I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="310.96" dur="3.539">not talking about two thousand a</text>
  <text start="312.43" dur="5.19">thousand I&amp;#39;m talking about tens of</text>
  <text start="314.499" dur="5.04">thousands of dollars for example i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="4.229">looking at this house in upstate New</text>
  <text start="319.539" dur="5.25">York which is about 45 minutes to an</text>
  <text start="321.849" dur="6.06">hour away from New York City and the</text>
  <text start="324.789" dur="5.011">house started a year ago they put it up</text>
  <text start="327.909" dur="4.201">for sale and it was around six hundred</text>
  <text start="329.8" dur="3.959">and fifty thousand dollars they are now</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="4.169">down to five hundred and sixty-five</text>
  <text start="333.759" dur="6.06">thousand still on the market they just</text>
  <text start="336.279" dur="5.461">dropped it twice in April and when I</text>
  <text start="339.819" dur="4.921">start to look around the country and I</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="5.609">move south and then I move Midwest and I</text>
  <text start="344.74" dur="3.929">move west I see the same thing occurring</text>
  <text start="347.349" dur="3.69">now a lot of people are writing in</text>
  <text start="348.669" dur="4.86">saying yes this is actually happening in</text>
  <text start="351.039" dur="7.44">my area there are a lot of homes but no</text>
  <text start="353.529" dur="6.72">one is coming no one is buying and we</text>
  <text start="358.479" dur="3.75">see at this point the corporate media</text>
  <text start="360.249" dur="6.301">they&amp;#39;re making up some stories that oh</text>
  <text start="362.229" dur="5.581">there&amp;#39;s no supply out there people they</text>
  <text start="366.55" dur="3.959">don&amp;#39;t see then they come up with another</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="6.389">excuse like Bloomberg says the strength</text>
  <text start="370.509" dur="7.5">of jobs has not yet reflected in home</text>
  <text start="374.199" dur="7.321">sales but soon it will well no the jobs</text>
  <text start="378.009" dur="6.571">are part time they manipulated the job</text>
  <text start="381.52" dur="5.819">market numbers the people who can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="384.58" dur="3.869">jobs they&amp;#39;re just not counted then they</text>
  <text start="387.339" dur="3.36">came up with something else that</text>
  <text start="388.449" dur="6.39">Millennials they really don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="390.699" dur="6.93">own a home they&amp;#39;re more mobile and they</text>
  <text start="394.839" dur="5.401">really don&amp;#39;t want to be stuck in a house</text>
  <text start="397.629" dur="6.27">and this is why no one&amp;#39;s really buying</text>
  <text start="400.24" dur="5.009">at this point well how about that</text>
  <text start="403.899" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re coming out of college and they</text>
  <text start="405.249" dur="3.931">can&amp;#39;t find a job how about they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="407.259" dur="3.99">coming out of college and they have so</text>
  <text start="409.18" dur="3.93">much student loans that they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="411.249" dur="2.7">the ability to pay it back how about</text>
  <text start="413.11" dur="3.359">they&amp;#39;re living with their parents</text>
  <text start="413.949" dur="6.45">because the jobs they have their part</text>
  <text start="416.469" dur="6.6">time how about all those people that</text>
  <text start="420.399" dur="4.86">were working at full time jobs they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="423.069" dur="4.85">lost their jobs like the 12,000 people</text>
  <text start="425.259" dur="5.13">that worked at Intel and the countless</text>
  <text start="427.919" dur="4.061">thousands of others that worked at other</text>
  <text start="430.389" dur="3.601">corporations that are being laid</text>
  <text start="431.98" dur="4.29">off right now which we&amp;#39;ve discussed over</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="6.09">and over throughout last year and this</text>
  <text start="436.27" dur="6.6">year and they&amp;#39;ve taken on part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="440.08" dur="5.37">how about all those 29,000 manufacturing</text>
  <text start="442.87" dur="5.13">jobs that were lost and those people are</text>
  <text start="445.45" dur="4.02">taking on part-time jobs so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="448" dur="4.53">really seeing and they don&amp;#39;t like to say</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="5.37">this is that the economy is slowly</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="4.44">imploding on itself and it is getting</text>
  <text start="454.84" dur="4.59">worse and worse as time goes on it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="456.97" dur="3.69">getting better i know the corporate</text>
  <text start="459.43" dur="2.7">media wants you to believe this i know</text>
  <text start="460.66" dur="4.56">the government comes out there and</text>
  <text start="462.13" dur="4.74">produces a lot of statistics they print</text>
  <text start="465.22" dur="4.04">up a lot of pretty graphs to show you</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="5.01">how their statistics show that</text>
  <text start="469.26" dur="4.42">manufacturing is growing retail is</text>
  <text start="471.88" dur="4.74">growing unemployment&amp;#39;s down to five</text>
  <text start="473.68" dur="4.98">percent but when you really look through</text>
  <text start="476.62" dur="4.86">everything they&amp;#39;ve been telling us and</text>
  <text start="478.66" dur="4.5">you see how they manipulate the</text>
  <text start="481.48" dur="3.21">information and we discussed as many</text>
  <text start="483.16" dur="4.86">many times before you start to realize</text>
  <text start="484.69" dur="5.01">that all of this is based on a lie the</text>
  <text start="488.02" dur="3.77">government doesn&amp;#39;t have to come out and</text>
  <text start="489.7" dur="5.52">tell us that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="491.79" dur="6.75">there&amp;#39;s no need for it when the economy</text>
  <text start="495.22" dur="6.27">is doing well your neighbors your family</text>
  <text start="498.54" dur="5.26">people around the country they already</text>
  <text start="501.49" dur="4.56">know it because they feel comfortable in</text>
  <text start="503.8" dur="4.85">their jobs they feel secure you see</text>
  <text start="506.05" dur="5.4">retail expanding housing expanding</text>
  <text start="508.65" dur="6.85">businesses they don&amp;#39;t lay off people</text>
  <text start="511.45" dur="6.92">okay they hire people and this is how</text>
  <text start="515.5" dur="4.95">you know the economy is truly growing</text>
  <text start="518.37" dur="3.64">you don&amp;#39;t need the statistical</text>
  <text start="520.45" dur="4.98">information from the government to tell</text>
  <text start="522.01" dur="6.18">you this you can see it you see strip</text>
  <text start="525.43" dur="5.46">malls expanding we saw this prior to</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="5.13">2008 but now we see the opposite</text>
  <text start="530.89" dur="4.86">happening and this is how you know the</text>
  <text start="533.32" dur="4.68">government is lying to you they lied all</text>
  <text start="535.75" dur="3.39">the way up to the crash of 2008 do you</text>
  <text start="538" dur="4.13">think all of a sudden they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="539.14" dur="7.17">start telling the truth absolutely not</text>
  <text start="542.13" dur="8.29">now Russia they are saying that the deal</text>
  <text start="546.31" dur="6.93">of freezing oil is off the table right</text>
  <text start="550.42" dur="4.92">now and they&amp;#39;re saying if Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="553.24" dur="4.53">goes ahead and they start and they</text>
  <text start="555.34" dur="4.47">increase their oil production Russia is</text>
  <text start="557.77" dur="4.77">going to do this and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="5.55">meet whatever they&amp;#39;re producing and we</text>
  <text start="562.54" dur="4.979">can see at this point the United States</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="5.039">is working they have been working with</text>
  <text start="567.519" dur="5.731">Saudi Arabia to drive the oil prices</text>
  <text start="570.399" dur="4.68">down because they know that Russia is a</text>
  <text start="573.25" dur="4.35">huge oil producer and they want to hit</text>
  <text start="575.079" dur="4.38">them where it hurts because they want a</text>
  <text start="577.6" dur="4.32">lot of pressure on Russia they want</text>
  <text start="579.459" dur="6.63">Russia to do what they want them to do</text>
  <text start="581.92" dur="6.51">and Russia is not cooperating they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="586.089" dur="6.331">stopped them in Syria multiple times</text>
  <text start="588.43" dur="7.17">they stopped them in Ukraine by having</text>
  <text start="592.42" dur="5.76">Crimea vote themselves away they go to</text>
  <text start="595.6" dur="4.56">the UN Security Council and say yes they</text>
  <text start="598.18" dur="3.57">have the right to do this the</text>
  <text start="600.16" dur="3.57">southeastern people want the same thing</text>
  <text start="601.75" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re always blaming it on Russia and</text>
  <text start="603.73" dur="4.26">Russia seems like that seems but they</text>
  <text start="606.01" dur="5.579">they&amp;#39;re always pushing peace in these</text>
  <text start="607.99" dur="5.099">areas and we can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="611.589" dur="2.641">continually pushing the oil prices down</text>
  <text start="613.089" dur="3.151">now that&amp;#39;s not the only reason they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="614.23" dur="3.93">pushing the oil prices down they need</text>
  <text start="616.24" dur="5.94">this to keep business operating in the</text>
  <text start="618.16" dur="7.76">u.s. because lower oil prices means</text>
  <text start="622.18" dur="7.32">companies make more profits deliveries</text>
  <text start="625.92" dur="5.71">production everything is cheaper do they</text>
  <text start="629.5" dur="4.56">have to lower prices no they can</text>
  <text start="631.63" dur="5.28">actually raise prices and they can make</text>
  <text start="634.06" dur="5.81">a bigger profit this is how the</text>

  <text start="645.1" dur="4.14">extra money not when they&amp;#39;re losing the</text>
  <text start="646.57" dur="3.9">jobs like we&amp;#39;ve been seeing but it</text>
  <text start="649.24" dur="3.45">allows them to feel a little bit more</text>
  <text start="650.47" dur="4.65">comfortable because it doesn&amp;#39;t cost as</text>
  <text start="652.69" dur="6.17">much to fill up your car you can go</text>
  <text start="655.12" dur="7.44">further in a week and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="658.86" dur="5.77">keep everything propped up for a little</text>
  <text start="662.56" dur="4.86">while longer because we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.63" dur="5.13">happening at this point we see that</text>
  <text start="667.42" dur="4.05">countries are starting to move away from</text>
  <text start="669.76" dur="3.93">the dollar now China has been doing this</text>
  <text start="671.47" dur="4.14">for quite a while so has Russia since</text>
  <text start="673.69" dur="4.23">the sanctions have been placed on Russia</text>
  <text start="675.61" dur="4.5">we see that they started to make their</text>
  <text start="677.92" dur="4.82">own payment system China is making their</text>
  <text start="680.11" dur="5.94">own payment system China is starting the</text>
  <text start="682.74" dur="6.219">aiib banking system they started the</text>
  <text start="686.05" dur="4.649">brick movement and they&amp;#39;re making a lot</text>
  <text start="688.959" dur="3.151">of bilateral trade agreements with many</text>
  <text start="690.699" dur="3.541">many different countries and setting up</text>
  <text start="692.11" dur="5.18">clearing houses and we see the yuan is</text>
  <text start="694.24" dur="4.54">slated to be in the basket of SDRs and</text>
  <text start="697.29" dur="3.74">we see late</text>
  <text start="698.78" dur="7.41">that China has announced their you on</text>
  <text start="701.03" dur="9.93">gold fix and this plan is to maneuver</text>
  <text start="706.19" dur="10.38">away from the dollar and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="710.96" dur="9.99">to shift to their own currency and this</text>
  <text start="716.57" dur="6.42">is a two year plan that has been put</text>
  <text start="720.95" dur="5.16">into motion to move away from the</text>
  <text start="722.99" dur="6.23">us-centric monetary system by trading</text>
  <text start="726.11" dur="5.88">physical gold in rem indie / chauhan</text>
  <text start="729.22" dur="5.17">china is slowly chipping away at the</text>
  <text start="731.99" dur="4.83">dominance of the u.s. dollar gold silver</text>
  <text start="734.39" dur="5.37">and petroleum or the three US dollar</text>
  <text start="736.82" dur="6.27">based commodities that China wants most</text>
  <text start="739.76" dur="5.12">control of by holding gold and moving</text>
  <text start="743.09" dur="5.97">away from the US dollar centric system</text>
  <text start="744.88" dur="7.63">we see that China needs less dollars at</text>
  <text start="749.06" dur="5.46">this point and this is not a planet that</text>
  <text start="752.51" dur="5.01">they just thought up they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="754.52" dur="5.46">working towards this for many years at</text>
  <text start="757.52" dur="3.84">this point because they realize in</text>
  <text start="759.98" dur="3.27">Russia realizes and many other countries</text>
  <text start="761.36" dur="3.99">realize and this is why we see a lot of</text>
  <text start="763.25" dur="4.14">countries in Africa moving away from</text>
  <text start="765.35" dur="4.26">keeping the dollar in reserves and</text>
  <text start="767.39" dur="4.56">removing and moving towards you wand and</text>
  <text start="769.61" dur="4.56">many more countries are jumping on the</text>
  <text start="771.95" dur="5.39">bandwagon right now and we can see that</text>
  <text start="774.17" dur="7.08">things are in full speed ahead and as</text>
  <text start="777.34" dur="6.76">time goes on we&amp;#39;re going to see China</text>
  <text start="781.25" dur="4.86">continually do this now we understand</text>
  <text start="784.1" dur="3.93">the u.s. is going to try to stop this</text>
  <text start="786.11" dur="4.32">anyway they possibly can we know that</text>
  <text start="788.03" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re trying to push for you know war</text>
  <text start="790.43" dur="5.85">or some type of an event and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="793.52" dur="6.69">going to stop remember the u.s. their</text>
  <text start="796.28" dur="6.87">debt load is so high at this point that</text>
  <text start="800.21" dur="6.84">if interest rates actually moved up to</text>
  <text start="803.15" dur="6.12">the normal rate this whole system they</text>
  <text start="807.05" dur="3.81">would now be able to support it and this</text>
  <text start="809.27" dur="4.71">is why we see them trying to bring in</text>
  <text start="810.86" dur="5.49">more revenue with faka a caer carbon</text>
  <text start="813.98" dur="4.14">taxes anything they possibly can think</text>
  <text start="816.35" dur="4.71">of to bring in more revenue because they</text>
  <text start="818.12" dur="5.73">realize as people lose their jobs and</text>
  <text start="821.06" dur="5.96">they get part-time jobs or if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="823.85" dur="6.3">get jobs at all that tax revenue</text>
  <text start="827.02" dur="5.23">disappears and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="830.15" dur="3.93">right now</text>
  <text start="832.25" dur="3.72">we see that Obamacare at this point it</text>
  <text start="834.08" dur="5.15">is a complete and utter disaster at this</text>
  <text start="835.97" dur="7.89">time now we understand that the co-op&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="839.23" dur="7.06">they are imploding on themselves and the</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="5.07">federal health officials they are</text>
  <text start="846.29" dur="4.95">refusing to give Congress hundreds of</text>
  <text start="848.93" dur="5.97">subpoenaed documents on Obamacare&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="851.24" dur="6.21">failed coops 12 of the 23 co-ops</text>
  <text start="854.9" dur="6.93">creating 2011 under Obamacare which by</text>
  <text start="857.45" dur="8.73">the way cause 2.4 billion they have now</text>
  <text start="861.83" dur="5.43">failed and eight of the remaining 11 it</text>
  <text start="866.18" dur="4.11">looks like they&amp;#39;re going to be going</text>
  <text start="867.26" dur="5.16">under this year but the US Department of</text>
  <text start="870.29" dur="4.73">Health and Human Services they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="872.42" dur="6.18">handing over the documents they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="875.02" dur="5.53">working with the house committee on</text>
  <text start="878.6" dur="6.03">oversight and government reform they</text>
  <text start="880.55" dur="6.24">refuse to hand it over and we see right</text>
  <text start="884.63" dur="5.49">now that enrollees they don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="886.79" dur="6.32">to do because at this point where do</text>
  <text start="890.12" dur="5.31">they go their claims aren&amp;#39;t being paid</text>
  <text start="893.11" dur="6.49">they&amp;#39;re scrambling to find new health</text>
  <text start="895.43" dur="7.64">insurance this is a disaster and this</text>
  <text start="899.6" dur="6.9">cost billions of dollars of wasted</text>
  <text start="903.07" dur="4.96">taxpayer money not to mention the</text>
  <text start="906.5" dur="3.87">website that they paid for that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="908.03" dur="5.84">work in the beginning which was millions</text>
  <text start="910.37" dur="7.65">and millions of dollars so once again</text>
  <text start="913.87" dur="7.18">this whole thing not a benefit to the</text>
  <text start="918.02" dur="5.01">people listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
