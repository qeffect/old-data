  <text start="38.829" dur="5.581">8th 2016 and thought of the episode is I</text>
  <text start="42.309" dur="4.651">am f calling for immediate action before</text>
  <text start="44.41" dur="4.71">the global economy completely collapses</text>
  <text start="46.96" dur="4.98">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="49.12" dur="5.82">collapse financial news now as we know</text>
  <text start="51.94" dur="5.939">the economy is continually declining</text>
  <text start="54.94" dur="5.549">we&amp;#39;re seeing retail contract we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="57.879" dur="4.921">seeing people in these retail markets</text>
  <text start="60.489" dur="3.66">being laid off we see major corporations</text>
  <text start="62.8" dur="5.91">coming out and saying yes we&amp;#39;re laying</text>
  <text start="64.149" dur="7.14">off these people and as we know during</text>
  <text start="68.71" dur="4.469">an economy that is recovering where more</text>
  <text start="71.289" dur="7.021">people are getting jobs according to the</text>
  <text start="73.179" dur="7.5">government the the economy expands but</text>
  <text start="78.31" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re seeing the opposite of what is</text>
  <text start="80.679" dur="4.891">happening in this country even though</text>
  <text start="83.32" dur="6.45">the US government is trying to convince</text>
  <text start="85.57" dur="5.76">us that everything is fine we see that</text>
  <text start="89.77" dur="6.709">whatever they&amp;#39;re telling us is the</text>
  <text start="91.33" dur="8.129">opposite and if we look in Texas we know</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="6.041">they&amp;#39;ve had a lot of people laid off in</text>
  <text start="99.459" dur="6.511">the energy sector and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="102.52" dur="8.07">see that retail sales in Texas they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="105.97" dur="7.11">declining now sales tax the collections</text>
  <text start="110.59" dur="5.49">of sales tax they don&amp;#39;t capture every</text>
  <text start="113.08" dur="4.44">retail sale but food products like flour</text>
  <text start="116.08" dur="4.649">sugar bread and vegetables they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.52" dur="6.719">exempt their motor vehicles well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120.729" dur="6.51">reported separately and the data is not</text>
  <text start="124.239" dur="5.97">seasonally adjusted at all and it can</text>
  <text start="127.239" dur="5.761">only be compared year over year sales</text>
  <text start="130.209" dur="4.791">tax collections Lag sales by one month</text>
  <text start="133" dur="3.93">with collections reported for February</text>
  <text start="135" dur="5.41">representing sales that occurred in</text>
  <text start="136.93" dur="7.11">January and it&amp;#39;s raw data it&amp;#39;s not based</text>
  <text start="140.41" dur="5.31">on estimates or surveys or opinions but</text>
  <text start="144.04" dur="5.699">on dollars that people actually spend</text>
  <text start="145.72" dur="5.299">and it basically gives us an on an</text>
  <text start="149.739" dur="5.901">unvarnished</text>
  <text start="151.019" dur="7.3">glimpse at what is really going on and</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="5.02">the retail sales boom in Texas first</text>
  <text start="158.319" dur="6.121">tripped up in June and August of last</text>
  <text start="160.66" dur="5.88">year when sales tax collections</text>
  <text start="164.44" dur="4.31">they started to decline year-over-year</text>
  <text start="166.54" dur="7.59">for the first time since March of 2010</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="9.1">then in October collections dropped to</text>
  <text start="174.13" dur="7.8">about 5.4 percent in over in November to</text>
  <text start="177.85" dur="5.6">3.3% December 1.0% in January for</text>
  <text start="181.93" dur="5.55">December&amp;#39;s crucial holiday sales</text>
  <text start="183.45" dur="6.58">collections fell 3.9 percent and now the</text>
  <text start="187.48" dur="4.98">comptroller&amp;#39;s office released data of</text>
  <text start="190.03" dur="7.2">sales tax collections in February and</text>
  <text start="192.46" dur="9.63">they plunged 6.8% it was a fifth month</text>
  <text start="197.23" dur="6.75">in a row of declines so where we saw the</text>
  <text start="202.09" dur="5.76">consumers continually spending</text>
  <text start="203.98" dur="6.24">throughout this bubble time period that</text>
  <text start="207.85" dur="4.44">the central bankers created we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="210.22" dur="5.16">starting to see that consumers right now</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re not spending and this is</text>
  <text start="215.38" dur="5.16">noticeable not just in Texas but in many</text>
  <text start="218.98" dur="5.19">of the states where we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="220.54" dur="8.07">same exact thing and we just reported</text>
  <text start="224.17" dur="7.68">yesterday that the credit growth has</text>
  <text start="228.61" dur="5.91">slowed dramatically people are tapped</text>
  <text start="231.85" dur="4.5">out people have lost their jobs their</text>
  <text start="234.52" dur="5.1">high paying jobs now when you go from a</text>
  <text start="236.35" dur="7.23">high paying job where you bought your</text>
  <text start="239.62" dur="6.45">house your car you have a standard type</text>
  <text start="243.58" dur="4.409">of living where you know your bills you</text>
  <text start="246.07" dur="3.81">know the income coming in when you lose</text>
  <text start="247.989" dur="5.881">that job and you have to take on one or</text>
  <text start="249.88" dur="6.78">two part-time jobs that income that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="5.52">coming in is never enough to support</text>
  <text start="256.66" dur="5.04">what you once had this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="259.39" dur="4.92">seeing delinquencies and car payments</text>
  <text start="261.7" dur="4.92">this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing people leaving</text>
  <text start="264.31" dur="4.109">their homes once again this is why we</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="5.13">see foreclosures picking up in many</text>
  <text start="268.419" dur="9.781">different areas and this is spreading</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="9.45">across the country and we see from all</text>
  <text start="278.2" dur="4.71">these statistical illusionary numbers</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="4.469">that are supposed to convince us that</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="7.2">the economy is improving it is not at</text>
  <text start="285.669" dur="8.551">all we see small business optimism it</text>
  <text start="290.11" dur="7.08">has crashed to two year lows actually</text>
  <text start="294.22" dur="4.11">the last 14 months had seen the biggest</text>
  <text start="297.19" dur="2.999">slump in small</text>
  <text start="298.33" dur="5.22">his confidence since the financial</text>
  <text start="300.189" dur="6.961">crisis even though we&amp;#39;ve been told that</text>
  <text start="303.55" dur="7.739">the recovery is incredible we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="307.15" dur="6.389">the opposite happening everywhere and it</text>
  <text start="311.289" dur="3.93">doesn&amp;#39;t fit into what the government is</text>
  <text start="313.539" dur="4.44">telling us and this is why the</text>
  <text start="315.219" dur="6.061">government decided to put certain</text>
  <text start="317.979" dur="4.921">programs into place to try to bring in</text>
  <text start="321.28" dur="4.169">more and more revenue because they</text>
  <text start="322.9" dur="5.579">understand that people are going to be</text>
  <text start="325.449" dur="5.641">losing their jobs they understand the</text>
  <text start="328.479" dur="4.261">income bracket is going to drop that</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="3.299">means revenues are going to drop that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="3.6">coming into the government this is why</text>
  <text start="334.389" dur="4.141">you see Obama care this is why you see</text>
  <text start="336.34" dur="5.4">FATCA this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="338.53" dur="5.52">implement a carbon tax this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="6.84">seeing all of these taxes at this point</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="6.479">in time and under FATCA it really has</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="5.73">become impossible for small business to</text>
  <text start="350.529" dur="9.051">expand internationally because as we</text>
  <text start="354.31" dur="7.829">know this new legislation punishes any</text>
  <text start="359.58" dur="6.73">foreign entity that does not report what</text>
  <text start="362.139" dur="6.571">an American is doing overseas this this</text>
  <text start="366.31" dur="6.329">single law is causing an implosion in</text>
  <text start="368.71" dur="7.799">the world economy and our government</text>
  <text start="372.639" dur="7.981">employees they don&amp;#39;t care if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.509" dur="5.761">destroying the entire economy as long as</text>
  <text start="380.62" dur="4.65">they get their piece of the action and</text>
  <text start="382.27" dur="4.769">they&amp;#39;re getting paid off actually most</text>
  <text start="385.27" dur="3.78">of these government employees have no</text>
  <text start="387.039" dur="4.791">idea what&amp;#39;s really going on all they</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="7.019">care about is their bottom line their</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="5.98">pocketbook and we&amp;#39;re seeing a massive</text>
  <text start="396.069" dur="4.02">swarm of Americans resigning their</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="4.139">citizenship because they cannot live or</text>
  <text start="400.089" dur="4.5">even conduct business overseas without</text>
  <text start="401.949" dur="6.06">US taxes even when they have nothing to</text>
  <text start="404.589" dur="6.48">do with us whatsoever they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="408.009" dur="4.25">being taxed and this is not helping the</text>
  <text start="411.069" dur="4.53">situation at all</text>
  <text start="412.259" dur="6.37">now the Baltic Dry Index moved up again</text>
  <text start="415.599" dur="8.31">it&amp;#39;s at 366 points and we&amp;#39;re noticing</text>
  <text start="418.629" dur="11.001">that the index is moving higher because</text>
  <text start="423.909" dur="8.161">of higher rates higher rates for</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="6.25">shipping iron ore</text>
  <text start="432.07" dur="8.1">and grain coal fertilizer and many other</text>
  <text start="435.88" dur="6.39">different raw materials and we can see</text>
  <text start="440.17" dur="8.61">at this point that the global economy</text>
  <text start="442.27" dur="9.54">it&amp;#39;s actually not improving and this is</text>
  <text start="448.78" dur="5.94">why the US government the central</text>
  <text start="451.81" dur="7.62">bankers the ECB they&amp;#39;ve been calling for</text>
  <text start="454.72" dur="6.5">a cashless society this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.43" dur="5.91">looking at negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="461.22" dur="7.39">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about what is going</text>
  <text start="465.34" dur="5.55">on in the global economy they realize</text>
  <text start="468.61" dur="4.89">things are deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="470.89" dur="4.74">quickly and they need certain things in</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="6.6">place and they need to make sure that</text>
  <text start="475.63" dur="9.72">people do not take their funds out of</text>
  <text start="480.1" dur="7.59">the banks and we can see with what</text>
  <text start="485.35" dur="7.92">they&amp;#39;re doing right now they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="487.69" dur="10.26">to control the entire situation now the</text>
  <text start="493.27" dur="9.15">Italian banking system is completely</text>
  <text start="497.95" dur="6.15">collapsing right now the Italian banking</text>
  <text start="502.42" dur="4.17">stocks have declined a whopping 28</text>
  <text start="504.1" dur="6.06">percent since the beginning of 2016 and</text>
  <text start="506.59" dur="5.7">the biggest Italian banks it looks even</text>
  <text start="510.16" dur="5.31">worse for them and this is what a</text>
  <text start="512.29" dur="4.98">financial crisis looks like just like we</text>
  <text start="515.47" dur="2.93">are seeing in South America the problem</text>
  <text start="517.27" dur="5">in Italy</text>
  <text start="518.4" dur="8.2">appears to be accelerating at this point</text>
  <text start="522.27" dur="9.03">italians already are taking their funds</text>
  <text start="526.6" dur="8.4">out of the bank slowly quietly and</text>
  <text start="531.3" dur="6.91">they&amp;#39;re pulling billions of euros out of</text>
  <text start="535" dur="6.69">the banking system and if these banks</text>
  <text start="538.21" dur="8.24">continue to crumble this quiet stealth</text>
  <text start="541.69" dur="9.93">run is going to be a major bank run and</text>
  <text start="546.45" dur="8.55">we see that italy would then if these</text>
  <text start="551.62" dur="7.17">banks collapsed would then spread to</text>
  <text start="555" dur="7.24">spain it would spread to portugal spread</text>
  <text start="558.79" dur="6.07">to greece to france and it wouldn&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="562.24" dur="4.26">there it would keep on going it</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="6.29">affect the derivative market and</text>
  <text start="566.5" dur="7.18">everything would start to fall apart</text>
  <text start="571.15" dur="5.61">there are many things that are occurring</text>
  <text start="573.68" dur="6.54">right now just like we saw back in 2008</text>
  <text start="576.76" dur="6.79">everyone believed AIG was fine Lehman</text>
  <text start="580.22" dur="6.66">was fine Bear Stearns was fine and then</text>
  <text start="583.55" dur="7.02">of course we find out later they were in</text>
  <text start="586.88" dur="5.34">major trouble and believe me there were</text>
  <text start="590.57" dur="3.24">many others that I not going to go</text>
  <text start="592.22" dur="3.33">through every single one of them but we</text>
  <text start="593.81" dur="3.72">can see the same thing is happening at</text>
  <text start="595.55" dur="3.87">this point we see Deutsche Bank we see</text>
  <text start="597.53" dur="4.41">the Italian banks we see the banks in</text>
  <text start="599.42" dur="4.77">South America and there are many</text>
  <text start="601.94" dur="4.89">companies here in the United States</text>
  <text start="604.19" dur="6.72">banks here in the United States that are</text>
  <text start="606.83" dur="6.53">in major financial trouble they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="610.91" dur="4.8">hiding everything at this point</text>
  <text start="613.36" dur="3.37">pretending like there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="615.71" dur="4.64">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="6.51">now the Internal Revenue Service is</text>
  <text start="620.35" dur="6.85">looking to hire private debt collectors</text>
  <text start="623.24" dur="6.42">for outstanding taxes and Senator</text>
  <text start="627.2" dur="4.14">Charles Chuck Grassley is one of the</text>
  <text start="629.66" dur="3.63">main supporters of this effort claiming</text>
  <text start="631.34" dur="4.02">that these companies can help bring in</text>
  <text start="633.29" dur="4.98">some of the billions in overdue taxes</text>
  <text start="635.36" dur="8.01">owed by Americans it&amp;#39;s roughly around as</text>
  <text start="638.27" dur="11.13">a mid as of mid-2015 the people of the</text>
  <text start="643.37" dur="8.25">US about 380 billion dollars now this is</text>
  <text start="649.4" dur="4.74">not the first time this happened where</text>
  <text start="651.62" dur="5.04">the IRS went outside to use private</text>
  <text start="654.14" dur="5.45">firms to collect debts that happened in</text>
  <text start="656.66" dur="4.98">the past and they&amp;#39;re realizing that</text>
  <text start="659.59" dur="3.61">those people who had their own</text>
  <text start="661.64" dur="3.51">businesses those people that are working</text>
  <text start="663.2" dur="3.93">that got laid off that owed the taxes</text>
  <text start="665.15" dur="4.77">they don&amp;#39;t have the income coming in</text>
  <text start="667.13" dur="5.1">anymore to pay for the last year&amp;#39;s taxes</text>
  <text start="669.92" dur="5.82">and many of these people who&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="672.23" dur="6.66">found a job who&amp;#39;ve fallen off lost their</text>
  <text start="675.74" dur="5.49">house got their car repossessed and it</text>
  <text start="678.89" dur="5.19">makes it very difficult to do anything</text>
  <text start="681.23" dur="5.94">and a lot of these people they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="684.08" dur="6.05">even find because they&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="687.17" dur="7.53">tents they&amp;#39;re living with relatives</text>
  <text start="690.13" dur="6.61">they&amp;#39;re not living the way they used to</text>
  <text start="694.7" dur="3.75">live where they had their own house</text>
  <text start="696.74" dur="3.24">their own car</text>
  <text start="698.45" dur="4.32">things like that we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="699.98" dur="6.18">2008 the same thing is happening once</text>
  <text start="702.77" dur="5.67">again and this will accelerate it will</text>
  <text start="706.16" dur="4.77">increase as you notice there are more</text>
  <text start="708.44" dur="6.06">and more people falling off the job</text>
  <text start="710.93" dur="6.09">market we can see that a lot more people</text>
  <text start="714.5" dur="7.35">are having very difficult time surviving</text>
  <text start="717.02" dur="7.11">and as we go forward I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="721.85" dur="5.58">surprised if we saw a debt prisons come</text>
  <text start="724.13" dur="6.78">back I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if we see</text>
  <text start="727.43" dur="5.79">an IRS type of police force trying to</text>
  <text start="730.91" dur="3.9">collect this money we already see that</text>
  <text start="733.22" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re going to be hiring out these</text>
  <text start="734.81" dur="5.7">private firms to try to get some of</text>
  <text start="737.27" dur="6.84">these funds because the IRS usually puts</text>
  <text start="740.51" dur="5.7">liens on your property tries to get a</text>
  <text start="744.11" dur="5.04">portion of your paycheck but if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="746.21" dur="5.04">nothing there there&amp;#39;s nothing they can</text>
  <text start="749.15" dur="5.75">do and this is the problem they are</text>
  <text start="751.25" dur="8.48">having at this point and at this time</text>
  <text start="754.9" dur="6.79">this situation is not going to improve</text>
  <text start="759.73" dur="4.9">people are not just going to all of a</text>
