  <text start="62.04" dur="5.91">June 15th 2018 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="65.07" dur="5.73">episode is the party is over it has</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="5.22">already begun let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="70.8" dur="4.65">economic collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="5.13">know that the United States has a</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="5.7">subprime problem and this was a subprime</text>
  <text start="78.3" dur="4.92">problem that we saw back in 2008 never</text>
  <text start="81.15" dur="3.93">gone away it has continued up until</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="5.22">today it is in the automobile industry</text>
  <text start="85.08" dur="7.41">it&amp;#39;s still in the housing market and in</text>
  <text start="88.44" dur="6.15">Canada Canada has a sub prime real</text>
  <text start="92.49" dur="5.66">estate problem but many people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="94.59" dur="6.98">know about this why because in Canada</text>
  <text start="98.15" dur="6.01">they called something different and</text>
  <text start="101.57" dur="5.38">another reason why people don&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="104.16" dur="7.319">that they have a subprime problem is</text>
  <text start="106.95" dur="6.8">because the way it is handled now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="111.479" dur="5.881">go through this a little bit here now</text>
  <text start="113.75" dur="7.93">there are differences between subprime</text>
  <text start="117.36" dur="6.93">borrowers and subprime loans subprime</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="5.28">loans are any loans that are below prime</text>
  <text start="124.29" dur="5.1">as in the typical lending criteria isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="5.999">met the part that&amp;#39;s poorly understood is</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="6.629">a borrower a loan or any combination of</text>
  <text start="132.959" dur="5.821">those can be subprime a borrower with</text>
  <text start="136.019" dur="5.851">excellent credit might want a subprime</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="5.22">loan this happens more often than you</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="4.17">think and is usually because a bank</text>
  <text start="144" dur="3.6">won&amp;#39;t lend as much money as needed</text>
  <text start="146.04" dur="3.71">because they don&amp;#39;t want to take the risk</text>
  <text start="147.6" dur="6.48">even though you have good credit and</text>
  <text start="149.75" dur="9.01">basically what happens is you need to go</text>
  <text start="154.08" dur="7.29">to the subprime area now when we look at</text>
  <text start="158.76" dur="5.699">this a borrower with excellent credit</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="6.3">might want a subprime loan this happens</text>
  <text start="164.459" dur="5.161">more than you think and no one thinks of</text>
  <text start="167.67" dur="3.48">a family in a nice neighborhood with a</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="4.399">private loan to buy their fourth or</text>
  <text start="171.15" dur="6.96">fifth condo as subprime but they are</text>
  <text start="174.019" dur="5.771">most people new subprime lenders blew up</text>
  <text start="178.11" dur="4.8">and naturally blame poor people</text>
  <text start="179.79" dur="4.5">immigrants with low credit scores the</text>
  <text start="182.91" dur="3.04">corporate media put this out there</text>
  <text start="184.29" dur="3.61">everyone believed it</text>
  <text start="185.95" dur="4.13">but there&amp;#39;s new research and the new</text>
  <text start="187.9" dur="4.68">research shows that a sudden rise in</text>
  <text start="190.08" dur="4.84">foreclosures during this period were due</text>
  <text start="192.58" dur="3.81">almost exclusively to investors with</text>
  <text start="194.92" dur="6">good credit good credit</text>
  <text start="196.39" dur="6.179">but using subprime lenders Canadian</text>
  <text start="200.92" dur="3.929">subprime lending is often done through</text>
  <text start="202.569" dur="4.861">private lenders you access through a</text>
  <text start="204.849" dur="4.86">mortgage broker good brokers always</text>
  <text start="207.43" dur="4.68">start at the best lender that usually</text>
  <text start="209.709" dur="4.89">has lower rates than your bank when you</text>
  <text start="212.11" dur="5.099">don&amp;#39;t qualify for these they move up the</text>
  <text start="214.599" dur="5.191">chain if your credit profile won&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="217.209" dur="4.441">work at bad credit lenders like home</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="4.89">trusts they&amp;#39;ll suggest a private lender</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="4.5">bad credit no credit no problem there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.68" dur="4.68">usually a private lender that&amp;#39;s willing</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="5.03">to make a deal sounds great so why</text>
  <text start="229.36" dur="5.87">doesn&amp;#39;t everyone use private lenders</text>
  <text start="231.18" dur="6.97">they aren&amp;#39;t taking bank rejects as a</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="5.759">charitable cause they&amp;#39;re doing so</text>
  <text start="238.15" dur="6.03">because they can charge a risk premium</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="6.131">despite being off record low interest</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="5.61">rates these lenders charge upwards of 8%</text>
  <text start="247.12" dur="5.429">and we&amp;#39;ve seen mortgages well into the</text>
  <text start="249.79" dur="6.39">20s and out in Canada</text>
  <text start="252.549" dur="5.101">TransUnion estimates that eleven point</text>
  <text start="256.18" dur="3.51">nine percent of the twenty eight point</text>
  <text start="257.65" dur="5.07">four million Canadian consumers with</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="6.42">credit profiles are subprime that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="4.98">roughly 3.4 million Canadians but we</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="4.08">can&amp;#39;t be sure these are the borrower&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="267.7" dur="5.99">what we do know is private lenders</text>
  <text start="270.19" dur="6.72">became extremely popular in Canada and</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="6.52">again if you can&amp;#39;t purchase that house</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="6">they move up the chain and they go to</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="5.7">those subprime lenders they become</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="5.67">riskier and you get the loan even though</text>
  <text start="285.91" dur="3.96">you have good credit that was what was</text>
  <text start="288.58" dur="4.05">happening in the US this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.87" dur="4.769">happening in Canada and when everything</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="3.81">starts to go south guess what happens</text>
  <text start="294.639" dur="4.621">people start to realize what was</text>
  <text start="296.44" dur="5.27">happening here and we know that Canada</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="5.55">is in this gigantic housing bubble and</text>
  <text start="301.71" dur="5.56">it&amp;#39;s deflating prices are coming down</text>
  <text start="304.81" dur="5.039">and the situation&amp;#39;s going to get worse</text>
  <text start="307.27" dur="5.579">and worse as time goes on here in the US</text>
  <text start="309.849" dur="4.981">we see US auto production it has crashed</text>
  <text start="312.849" dur="4.201">the most in five years u.s.</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="4.32">manufacturing production slumped by 0.7</text>
  <text start="317.05" dur="2.61">percent month on month in May this is</text>
  <text start="319.15" dur="4.32">the biggest draw</text>
  <text start="319.66" dur="8.01">since July 2016 dragging industrial</text>
  <text start="323.47" dur="6.54">production down by 0.1% and we can see</text>
  <text start="327.67" dur="4.47">right now that things are starting to go</text>
  <text start="330.01" dur="5.34">the opposite way and again what will</text>
  <text start="332.14" dur="5.37">happen is they&amp;#39;ll realize the statistics</text>
  <text start="335.35" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;ll make it look better later on to</text>
  <text start="337.51" dur="3.99">make everyone believe that everything is</text>
  <text start="339.13" dur="3.84">great this is what the government likes</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="5.13">to doing that they&amp;#39;re doing it for a</text>
  <text start="342.97" dur="7.55">reason now because they&amp;#39;re pushing the</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="6.18">idea that the economy&amp;#39;s great while</text>
  <text start="350.52" dur="5.29">overheating the entire system to</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="5.87">collapse because we are in a central</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="5.34">banking system this system can&amp;#39;t go on</text>
  <text start="358.68" dur="5.29">Trump the Patriots they know this and</text>
  <text start="361.15" dur="5.21">they&amp;#39;re pushing it to the edge and how</text>
  <text start="363.97" dur="6.27">are they doing this well with tariffs</text>
  <text start="366.36" dur="7.06">with reciprocal taxes with tax cuts you</text>
  <text start="370.24" dur="5.34">name it anything that they can use to</text>
  <text start="373.42" dur="5.1">bring the system down this is what</text>
  <text start="375.58" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re doing at the same time telling</text>
  <text start="378.52" dur="4.05">everyone how great the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="380.17" dur="4.8">that all this stuff is working this is</text>
  <text start="382.57" dur="5.76">part of the plan they&amp;#39;re using the same</text>
  <text start="384.97" dur="5.1">exact strategy as the central bankers</text>
  <text start="388.33" dur="5.52">the established in the deep state did in</text>
  <text start="390.07" dur="5.37">the past think North Korea during the</text>
  <text start="393.85" dur="5.04">peace process that was happening behind</text>
  <text start="395.44" dur="5.64">the scenes what was the message our</text>
  <text start="398.89" dur="4.22">nuclear arsenals bigger than yours our</text>
  <text start="401.08" dur="5.49">buttons bigger than yours</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="5.77">he let McMasters put out the reports</text>
  <text start="406.57" dur="4.71">that we&amp;#39;re gonna be going to war this is</text>
  <text start="408.88" dur="4.05">the troop loss this is I mean this is</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="3.27">exactly what the corporate media was</text>
  <text start="412.93" dur="4.59">feeding on but behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="414.55" dur="6">something else was going on that is what</text>
  <text start="417.52" dur="6.24">is happening right now what you see out</text>
  <text start="420.55" dur="5.55">in front of you is the central bank deep</text>
  <text start="423.76" dur="4.68">state illusion and they&amp;#39;re just keeping</text>
  <text start="426.1" dur="4.67">it going what&amp;#39;s happening behind the</text>
  <text start="428.44" dur="5.81">scenes well</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re preparing the entire system for</text>
  <text start="434.25" dur="3.87">the transition that is what is happening</text>
  <text start="436.74" dur="3.81">right now and we can see that the party</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="4.799">is over and when we look at the central</text>
  <text start="440.55" dur="8.519">bank&amp;#39;s and we look at QE we can see that</text>
  <text start="442.919" dur="8.131">QE basically has stopped and the central</text>
  <text start="449.069" dur="4.801">bank&amp;#39;s they are raising rates right now</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="5.369">the Fed has raised the rates and when</text>
  <text start="453.87" dur="7.049">you look at this you can see the effects</text>
  <text start="456.419" dur="7.951">of QE being tapered and basically</text>
  <text start="460.919" dur="6.03">stopped now when you look at this you</text>
  <text start="464.37" dur="4.26">can see that the central bank on a</text>
  <text start="466.949" dur="5.34">monthly basis</text>
  <text start="468.63" dur="5.64">QE volumes have dropped quite a bit and</text>
  <text start="472.289" dur="4.291">when you continually look at this on a</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="6.06">yeren two-year basis you can see that it</text>
  <text start="476.58" dur="6.6">is basically almost done with and this</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="7.44">is happening not just here in the US but</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="6.229">out in Europe also and while this is</text>
  <text start="487.77" dur="3.78">happening you can see the effects</text>
  <text start="489.409" dur="3.82">because they&amp;#39;re raising rates at the</text>
  <text start="491.55" dur="4.739">same time and you see the housing market</text>
  <text start="493.229" dur="5.521">it is shaking you can see that the</text>
  <text start="496.289" dur="5.31">housing bubbles in Canada and in Europe</text>
  <text start="498.75" dur="6.419">in Australia they&amp;#39;re deflating right now</text>
  <text start="501.599" dur="5.88">we see credit markets and banks in</text>
  <text start="505.169" dur="3.87">Europe they&amp;#39;re starting to shake and</text>
  <text start="507.479" dur="3.601">we&amp;#39;re getting all these problems that</text>
  <text start="509.039" dur="6.18">are popping up now and this is all</text>
  <text start="511.08" dur="7.82">because QE is being removed from the</text>
  <text start="515.219" dur="5.661">system so if you had a drug addict</text>
  <text start="518.9" dur="4.56">and you stop giving drugs to this</text>
  <text start="520.88" dur="5.459">individual guess what happens</text>
  <text start="523.46" dur="5.52">withdrawal symptoms and it goes on for</text>
  <text start="526.339" dur="5.25">quite a while the whole body has to</text>
  <text start="528.98" dur="3.51">reboot it has to reset that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.589" dur="5.731">happening right now</text>
  <text start="532.49" dur="6.42">and we&amp;#39;re seeing certain areas well</text>
  <text start="537.32" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re starting to go through the</text>
  <text start="538.91" dur="4.74">withdrawal symptoms and this will</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="5.46">continue now the Fed has raised the</text>
  <text start="543.65" dur="5.82">rates once again and we can see QE is</text>
  <text start="547.19" dur="5.25">coming to a halt and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="549.47" dur="6.9">unwind this entire system is being</text>
  <text start="552.44" dur="5.22">primed to collapse now again this is the</text>
  <text start="556.37" dur="3.45">central bank where they want to gain the</text>
  <text start="557.66" dur="4.29">narrative and of course they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="559.82" dur="4.68">say they&amp;#39;ve done nothing wrong if you go</text>
  <text start="561.95" dur="4.56">back in time what have they used in the</text>
  <text start="564.5" dur="5.25">past to tell you that it was somebody</text>
  <text start="566.51" dur="4.53">else look at 2008 for instance we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="2.73">do anything wrong it was the subprime</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="4.049">securities we didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong</text>
  <text start="572.48" dur="6.09">but they set it up where they were able</text>
  <text start="575.089" dur="6.651">to create currency and push the</text>
  <text start="578.57" dur="6.18">government into allowing them to do this</text>
  <text start="581.74" dur="5.62">they&amp;#39;re very tricky and very smart and</text>
  <text start="584.75" dur="4.44">how they do all these things and they</text>
  <text start="587.36" dur="3.81">set it up to make it seem like they had</text>
  <text start="589.19" dur="4.5">nothing to do with it we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="5.16">innocent behind the scenes here trying</text>
  <text start="593.69" dur="4.5">to manage the economy while the</text>
  <text start="596.33" dur="5.91">government and Wall Street and everyone</text>
  <text start="598.19" dur="7.2">else messes it up and this is the the</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="6.96">illusion they create during these</text>
  <text start="605.39" dur="7.17">scenarios and this is what the battle is</text>
  <text start="609.2" dur="6.24">all about to control and gain the</text>
  <text start="612.56" dur="4.8">narrative and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="615.44" dur="4.23">this is going to be quite tough because</text>
  <text start="617.36" dur="5.64">you can see both sides are pushing the</text>
  <text start="619.67" dur="5.58">economy to the edge Trump and Patriots</text>
  <text start="623" dur="6.15">are doing it one way the central bank is</text>
  <text start="625.25" dur="6.24">doing it another way central bank is</text>
  <text start="629.15" dur="4.05">doing it the way they always do it</text>
  <text start="631.49" dur="4.53">and we can see that both of them are</text>
  <text start="633.2" dur="5.87">going to clash who&amp;#39;s gonna come out on</text>
  <text start="636.02" dur="6.72">top well we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see and</text>
  <text start="639.07" dur="4.87">remember the central bank right now most</text>
  <text start="642.74" dur="3.21">of the time they&amp;#39;re behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="643.94" dur="2.37">yes they have the corporate media behind</text>
  <text start="645.95" dur="1.92">them</text>
  <text start="646.31" dur="2.969">they route the corporate media routes</text>
  <text start="647.87" dur="4.08">for the central bank because as part of</text>
  <text start="649.279" dur="6.331">the whole system but Trump has a loud</text>
  <text start="651.95" dur="6.329">mouth he tweets a lot and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="655.61" dur="5.52">see if he&amp;#39;s able with the Patriots</text>
  <text start="658.279" dur="6.541">behind the scenes to gain the narrative</text>
  <text start="661.13" dur="6.56">and control where we go once the system</text>
  <text start="664.82" dur="6.06">starts collapsing because if Trump can</text>
  <text start="667.69" dur="5.62">control what is going on here with the</text>
  <text start="670.88" dur="5.76">Patriots and blame it on the central</text>
  <text start="673.31" dur="5.25">bank he&amp;#39;ll have the upper hand if the</text>
  <text start="676.64" dur="4.86">central bank with the corporate media if</text>
  <text start="678.56" dur="5.07">they can put their message out and say</text>
  <text start="681.5" dur="4.41">it was Trump&amp;#39;s policies it was tariffs</text>
  <text start="683.63" dur="4.2">it was everything else that he did well</text>
  <text start="685.91" dur="4.41">there&amp;#39;s going to be a problem so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="687.83" dur="3.66">in this gigantic battle right now the</text>
