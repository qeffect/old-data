  <text start="128.47" dur="4.02">wanted it to go remember at the deep</text>

  <text start="151.99" dur="5.76">pushing their agenda forward</text>
  <text start="155.11" dur="6.15">and this is exactly what he wanted to</text>
  <text start="157.75" dur="5.61">happen and it is happening now today</text>
  <text start="161.26" dur="5.01">here in the United States Trump was out</text>
  <text start="163.36" dur="5.37">there and he tweeted out that the deal</text>
  <text start="166.27" dur="4.95">with China is getting very very close</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="5.76">this is tweet getting very close to a</text>
  <text start="171.22" dur="3.9">big deal with China they want it and so</text>
  <text start="174.49" dur="3.15">do we</text>
  <text start="175.12" dur="5.13">now what exactly does Trump and the</text>
  <text start="177.64" dur="5.52">patriots want do they want all the</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="5.82">tariffs gone right now do they want all</text>
  <text start="183.16" dur="6.96">the trade deals happening no he wants</text>
  <text start="186.07" dur="5.55">phase one is he removing the tariffs I</text>
  <text start="190.12" dur="3.839">don&amp;#39;t believe so</text>
  <text start="191.62" dur="5.04">actually there were new tariffs that</text>
  <text start="193.959" dur="6.211">were scheduled to kicking on China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.66" dur="5.549">imports which haven&amp;#39;t been hit yet by</text>
  <text start="200.17" dur="6.41">the other tariffs and they were supposed</text>
  <text start="202.209" dur="9.061">to happen on December 15th so once again</text>
  <text start="206.58" dur="7.18">he&amp;#39;s not removing tariffs he&amp;#39;s making a</text>
  <text start="211.27" dur="4.14">deal where China is stepping up to the</text>
  <text start="213.76" dur="2.79">plate and making the deal with the</text>
  <text start="215.41" dur="4.26">United States so they don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="216.55" dur="5.28">additional tariffs Trump doesn&amp;#39;t care if</text>
  <text start="219.67" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s more tariffs it&amp;#39;s more money to</text>
  <text start="221.83" dur="4.65">the United States gives him more time</text>
  <text start="223.51" dur="6.03">now why is China looking to make a deal</text>
  <text start="226.48" dur="7.02">well this week China reported that the</text>
  <text start="229.54" dur="6.18">price of pork has doubled and prices for</text>
  <text start="233.5" dur="3.95">other sources of animal protein have</text>
  <text start="235.72" dur="4.56">been pushed up in the question is why</text>
  <text start="237.45" dur="5.86">it&amp;#39;s primarily due to the swine fever</text>
  <text start="240.28" dur="8.19">epidemic and it&amp;#39;s costing China around</text>
  <text start="243.31" dur="8.73">40% of its hog population and we can see</text>
  <text start="248.47" dur="6.21">why they would like to make a deal now</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="4.919">this is coming from Oh a and and they</text>
  <text start="254.68" dur="4.38">tweeted out that the US and China have</text>
  <text start="256.959" dur="6.471">reportedly reached an agreement on terms</text>
  <text start="259.06" dur="9">of phase 1 it&amp;#39;s now awaiting approval</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="8.62">from Trump so it looks like Trump will</text>
  <text start="268.06" dur="8.97">be making the phase 1 deal and the new</text>
  <text start="272.05" dur="6.7">tariffs will not be applied and we need</text>
  <text start="277.03" dur="5.53">to remember</text>
  <text start="278.75" dur="7.26">that china is suffering a slow death by</text>
  <text start="282.56" dur="5.97">a thousand paper cuts the bleeding of</text>
  <text start="286.01" dur="5.34">cash in combination with direct loss of</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="5.13">about 75 billion in annual export</text>
  <text start="291.35" dur="5.37">products that the US companies have now</text>
  <text start="293.66" dur="4.7">sourced from alternative Asian Nations</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="3.99">is biting hard</text>
  <text start="298.36" dur="4.42">remember the tweet that Trump put out</text>
  <text start="300.71" dur="5.03">there why is China</text>
  <text start="302.78" dur="6.57">barring money from the World Bank</text>
  <text start="305.74" dur="6.1">because they&amp;#39;re suffering right now so</text>
  <text start="309.35" dur="4.17">what effect does this have on China what</text>
  <text start="311.84" dur="5.79">effect does this have on Europe</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="6.69">well the direct outcome is a drop in</text>
  <text start="317.63" dur="4.59">China&amp;#39;s purchasing of industrial goods</text>
  <text start="320.21" dur="3.27">they would normally use in the</text>
  <text start="322.22" dur="3.48">manufacturing process</text>
  <text start="323.48" dur="5.07">this lack of Chinese purchasing</text>
  <text start="325.7" dur="6.69">purchasing is one of the top reasons for</text>
  <text start="328.55" dur="6.03">the stall in the European economy there</text>
  <text start="332.39" dur="4.26">is no actual intent to reach a trade</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="4.14">deal with China where the u.s. drops all</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="4.29">tariffs right now when we turns to</text>
  <text start="338.72" dur="5.1">holding hands with China saying</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="7.05">everything is great Trump does not play</text>
  <text start="343.82" dur="7.76">that way what Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.99" dur="7.71">putting pressure on the central bank</text>
  <text start="351.58" dur="4.84">system he can walk away anytime he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.7" dur="4.29">done it before</text>
  <text start="356.42" dur="5.22">he doesn&amp;#39;t care the tariffs are bringing</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="4.92">in billions and billions of dollars that</text>
  <text start="361.64" dur="5.46">tariffs are pushing companies out of</text>
  <text start="364.91" dur="7.43">China moving into other countries or</text>
  <text start="367.1" dur="9.21">even back to the United States and Trump</text>
  <text start="372.34" dur="6.52">he&amp;#39;s getting phase one and he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="376.31" dur="6.24">this because he&amp;#39;s going to help the</text>
  <text start="378.86" dur="6.6">farmers and he&amp;#39;s protecting some very</text>
  <text start="382.55" dur="7.5">specific US business interests like</text>
  <text start="385.46" dur="8.67">Apple and there are many others the</text>
  <text start="390.05" dur="8.78">actual goal of Trump with this us-china</text>
  <text start="394.13" dur="8.84">trade reset is a complete - coupling of</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="7.84">us critical manufacturing within China</text>
  <text start="402.97" dur="6.34">right now we are dependent on China and</text>
  <text start="406.67" dur="4.95">other nations for manufacturing this is</text>
  <text start="409.31" dur="3.32">way the globalists the central banks</text>
  <text start="411.62" dur="3.86">have set it up</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="6.89">Trump is putting pressure because he</text>
  <text start="415.48" dur="8.43">wants to decouple us from all of that</text>
  <text start="419.52" dur="8.08">what is the u.s. MCA this is going to</text>
  <text start="423.91" dur="6.27">set up a manufacturing powerhouse here</text>
  <text start="427.6" dur="6.27">in Mexico the United States we discussed</text>
  <text start="430.18" dur="7.02">this before in essence and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.87" dur="8.28">doing right now he&amp;#39;s going to destroy</text>
  <text start="437.2" dur="7.65">the globalist central bank model that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.15" dur="4.74">his plan I mean everyone thinks that oh</text>
  <text start="444.85" dur="2.64">he&amp;#39;s just making a new trade deal with</text>
  <text start="446.89" dur="4.29">China</text>
  <text start="447.49" dur="5.46">he just wants an equal trade between the</text>
  <text start="451.18" dur="4.55">United States and China yes that&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="452.95" dur="5.13">of it but the overall big picture is</text>
  <text start="455.73" dur="4.33">much much larger than the senem really</text>
  <text start="458.08" dur="3.45">has nothing to do with China it has to</text>
  <text start="460.06" dur="3.6">do with the globalist and the central</text>
  <text start="461.53" dur="3.96">bank system this is why he was out there</text>
  <text start="463.66" dur="5.52">when he was speaking to the UN saying</text>
  <text start="465.49" dur="8.09">the globalists do not have a future he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="7.44">dismantling all of their economic</text>
  <text start="473.58" dur="9">institutions their systems their trade</text>
  <text start="476.62" dur="8.81">and he&amp;#39;s doing it very methodically</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="5.59">where no one really even notices this</text>
  <text start="485.43" dur="5.53">everyone believes that he&amp;#39;s just making</text>
  <text start="488.17" dur="6.32">these crazy trade deals or he&amp;#39;s he wants</text>
  <text start="490.96" dur="6.96">a trade war that&amp;#39;s not what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="494.49" dur="4.45">this is all being done to destroy the</text>
  <text start="497.92" dur="2.46">central bank system this is why</text>
  <text start="498.94" dur="3.87">Kissinger was out there this is why</text>
  <text start="500.38" dur="5.13">Christine Lagarde from the IMF who is</text>
  <text start="502.81" dur="6.12">now the ECB president this is why they</text>
  <text start="505.51" dur="6.469">were all out there saying there needs to</text>
  <text start="508.93" dur="6.45">be there needs to be a deal between</text>
  <text start="511.979" dur="6.011">China and the United States because</text>
  <text start="515.38" dur="3.69">Europe is hurting right now the rest of</text>
  <text start="517.99" dur="5.76">the world is hurting right now</text>
  <text start="519.07" dur="9.32">and if there is no deal with the United</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="7.62">States and China their system implodes</text>
  <text start="528.39" dur="6.51">but what is Trump doing</text>
  <text start="531.37" dur="6.09">he&amp;#39;s using the trade war and the tariffs</text>
  <text start="534.9" dur="8.44">to bring in billions and billions of</text>
  <text start="537.46" dur="9.57">dollars to give him time to build and</text>
  <text start="543.34" dur="7.17">create a manufacturing powerhouse that</text>
  <text start="547.03" dur="7.68">can compete with what the globalist the</text>
  <text start="550.51" dur="7.65">central banks have set up he will then</text>
  <text start="554.71" dur="8.28">have not him himself but the United</text>
  <text start="558.16" dur="9.02">States will then have leverage against</text>
  <text start="562.99" dur="7.85">the central bank and the globalist he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.18" dur="7.84">reversing everything that was done and</text>
  <text start="570.84" dur="6.19">eventually once he has this leverage the</text>
  <text start="575.02" dur="5.49">central banks the globalist they lose</text>
  <text start="577.03" dur="6.9">control which will bring us to the next</text>
  <text start="580.51" dur="4.86">phase which means he goes after the</text>
  <text start="583.93" dur="3.69">central bank now I noticed the</text>
  <text start="585.37" dur="4.47">mainstream media I know the Fed had</text>
  <text start="587.62" dur="4.35">their there meeting and their minutes</text>
  <text start="589.84" dur="3.6">came out and they said for this year</text>
  <text start="591.97" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re not going to be raising rates in</text>
  <text start="593.44" dur="3.9">2020 looks like they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="595.33" dur="4.68">raising rates either the mainstream</text>
  <text start="597.34" dur="4.92">media is making a huge push to make sure</text>
  <text start="600.01" dur="6.3">that we all understand that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="602.26" dur="7.95">not doing anything else I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="606.31" dur="6.54">this is true maybe for this year Trump</text>
  <text start="610.21" dur="5.49">has pushed it as hard as he possibly</text>
  <text start="612.85" dur="5.97">could got the rates where he wanted for</text>
  <text start="615.7" dur="7.14">this year got stimulus started but I</text>
  <text start="618.82" dur="6.81">don&amp;#39;t believe he is finished because he</text>
  <text start="622.84" dur="6.27">knows that the central bank the</text>
  <text start="625.63" dur="7.02">globalists around the world will</text>
  <text start="629.11" dur="8.04">continually lower rates in other central</text>
  <text start="632.65" dur="7.71">banks and this will make it difficult</text>
  <text start="637.15" dur="8.57">for the u.s. so Trump will then push the</text>
  <text start="640.36" dur="7.31">Fed to do the same to match them so</text>
  <text start="645.72" dur="3.51">does does the deep state does the</text>
  <text start="647.67" dur="5.67">Central Bank of the globalist do they</text>
  <text start="649.23" dur="5.34">want the Fed to stop yes remember they</text>
  <text start="653.34" dur="4.26">never wanted this in the first place</text>
  <text start="654.57" dur="5.25">they wanted the rates to move up they</text>
  <text start="657.6" dur="4.56">wanted them to increase so they could</text>
  <text start="659.82" dur="5.88">bring the system down Trump of the</text>
  <text start="662.16" dur="5.73">Patriots they reverse this on them and I</text>
  <text start="665.7" dur="3.45">do believe that Trump is just not gonna</text>
  <text start="667.89" dur="3.24">let this go I don&amp;#39;t care if it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="669.15" dur="3.54">election year or not look what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="671.13" dur="4.47">happening during the election year I</text>
  <text start="672.69" dur="5.13">believe he&amp;#39;s going to continually push</text>
  <text start="675.6" dur="6.36">his economic agenda yes maybe in the</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="7.65">past this might have been true but I</text>
  <text start="681.96" dur="7.08">don&amp;#39;t believe at this point Trump can</text>
  <text start="685.47" dur="6.54">stop where he&amp;#39;s not going to push the</text>
  <text start="689.04" dur="5.67">Fed to drop rates even further I think</text>
  <text start="692.01" dur="6.96">he wants him down to zero but we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="694.71" dur="6.12">to see how this plays out because his</text>
  <text start="698.97" dur="4.23">goal is not to make nice-nice with</text>
  <text start="700.83" dur="4.26">everyone his goal is to go after the</text>
  <text start="703.2" dur="7.95">central bank to go after the globus and</text>
  <text start="705.09" dur="10.11">to destroy that system and create a new</text>
  <text start="711.15" dur="7.56">system that can&amp;#39;t be touched that can</text>
  <text start="715.2" dur="6.48">compete against the globalist central</text>
  <text start="718.71" dur="6.54">bank system because he needs to do this</text>
  <text start="721.68" dur="5.16">for us to move to the next phase and the</text>
  <text start="725.25" dur="4.46">next phase is going after the central</text>
  <text start="726.84" dur="6.33">bank&amp;#39;s the establishment altogether and</text>
  <text start="729.71" dur="4.69">we&amp;#39;re heading in that direction and this</text>
  <text start="733.17" dur="3.81">is another win for Trump and the</text>
  <text start="734.4" dur="6.57">Patriots their plan their economic plan</text>
  <text start="736.98" dur="7.5">the economic storm is growing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="740.97" dur="7.53">getting stronger the globalists the</text>
