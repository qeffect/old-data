  <text start="58.91" dur="6.3">episode 1359 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.6" dur="5.129">August 20th 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="65.21" dur="5.7">episode is beware of the red swan and</text>
  <text start="67.729" dur="5.671">negative interest rates let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="70.91" dur="5.76">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="73.4" dur="7.32">as we know the NAFTA negotiations they</text>
  <text start="76.67" dur="6">have started now robert light Iser he</text>
  <text start="80.72" dur="4.2">came out and he&amp;#39;s the by the way he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="82.67" dur="3.809">the US Trade Representative he came out</text>
  <text start="84.92" dur="2.64">and said the negotiations would be</text>
  <text start="86.479" dur="4.771">transparent</text>
  <text start="87.56" dur="5.58">well they promised transparency but what</text>
  <text start="91.25" dur="7.59">is happening right now is they are</text>
  <text start="93.14" dur="10.259">discussing the NAFTA parameters in</text>
  <text start="98.84" dur="7.41">secrecy right now and the documents the</text>
  <text start="103.399" dur="5.011">negotiations they are all labeled</text>
  <text start="106.25" dur="4.95">classified and they&amp;#39;re cloaked in</text>
  <text start="108.41" dur="5.819">secrecy but corporate lobbyists they</text>
  <text start="111.2" dur="5.699">have access to all of this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="114.229" dur="3.691">all over it so here we are once again</text>
  <text start="116.899" dur="3.921">just like the TPP</text>
  <text start="117.92" dur="7.41">where they&amp;#39;re keeping the entire</text>
  <text start="120.82" dur="7.119">negotiations out of the spotlight not</text>
  <text start="125.33" dur="4.98">allowing the American people to see</text>
  <text start="127.939" dur="5.281">exactly what is going on now the</text>
  <text start="130.31" dur="6.06">Electronic Frontier Foundation said the</text>
  <text start="133.22" dur="4.68">following once again following the</text>
  <text start="136.37" dur="4.91">failed model of the trans-pacific</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="6.54">partnership the USTR will be keeping the</text>
  <text start="141.28" dur="5.709">negotiating text secret and in actual</text>
  <text start="144.44" dur="4.769">regression from the TPP will be holding</text>
  <text start="146.989" dur="5.911">no public stakeholder events alongside</text>
  <text start="149.209" dur="5.941">the first round this may or may not set</text>
  <text start="152.9" dur="4.5">a precedent for future outs that will</text>
  <text start="155.15" dur="4.32">rotate between the three countries every</text>
  <text start="157.4" dur="5.399">few weeks thereafter with a scheduled</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="6.39">end date of mid 2018 now you have to</text>
  <text start="162.799" dur="5.131">remember during light eyes errs</text>
  <text start="165.86" dur="4.379">confirmation hearing in March he</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="3.93">promised to make the negotiations</text>
  <text start="170.239" dur="4.621">transparent and to listen to more</text>
  <text start="171.86" dur="6.36">stakeholders and the public but as we</text>
  <text start="174.86" dur="6.06">can see this isn&amp;#39;t happening as of right</text>
  <text start="178.22" dur="4.35">now now this might change but we can see</text>
  <text start="180.92" dur="4.8">at this point there are certain</text>
  <text start="182.57" dur="4.81">interests that are you know keeping this</text>
  <text start="185.72" dur="4.51">completely a secret</text>
  <text start="187.38" dur="5.64">now we know why they don&amp;#39;t want what is</text>
  <text start="190.23" dur="4.74">actually in NAFTA to be out there in the</text>
  <text start="193.02" dur="4.59">public and they don&amp;#39;t want to be talking</text>
  <text start="194.97" dur="5.52">about what is in there out in the open</text>
  <text start="197.61" dur="5.7">because these agreements were never</text>
  <text start="200.49" dur="5.76">created to benefit the American people</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="5.34">it was not to bring more jobs here into</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="4.73">the United States but personally I think</text>
  <text start="208.65" dur="4.8">this needs all to come out in the open</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="4.48">everyone needs to know what is going on</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="3.42">everyone needs to realize what is</text>
  <text start="215.46" dur="3.12">happening and I think at this point</text>
  <text start="216.87" dur="3.84">Trump needs to say you know something</text>
  <text start="218.58" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re done with this and we need to</text>
  <text start="220.71" dur="6.36">bring this out into the open but this</text>
  <text start="222.51" dur="6.48">isn&amp;#39;t happening now the US economy is</text>
  <text start="227.07" dur="4.62">going to be running into major major</text>
  <text start="228.99" dur="4.17">problems now we talked about what is</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="4.95">happening in the accompany with retail</text>
  <text start="233.16" dur="5.07">GDP unemployment tax receipts I mean you</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="3.96">name it we&amp;#39;ve been talking about it the</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="5.04">automobile subprime and we could see</text>
  <text start="240.6" dur="5.52">that the entire economy is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="243.27" dur="4.65">very very quickly and a lot of the US</text>
  <text start="246.12" dur="4.53">economy has been propped up by foreign</text>
  <text start="247.92" dur="5.28">investors low interest rates hedge funds</text>
  <text start="250.65" dur="5.7">investment companies buying up real</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="7.14">estate well this might be coming to an</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="5.25">end because we kind of expected this we</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="4.14">kind of knew that this might have been</text>
  <text start="261.6" dur="5.04">occurring in the background because we</text>
  <text start="264.48" dur="5.52">know that China has been creating their</text>
  <text start="266.64" dur="6.6">belt and Road there are Silk Road and we</text>
  <text start="270" dur="6.56">know that China over the many years have</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="6.75">been investing in the United States and</text>
  <text start="276.56" dur="5.11">right now what is happening is China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="5.07">State Council they&amp;#39;ve issued guidelines</text>
  <text start="281.67" dur="6.84">on what Chinese companies can and cannot</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="6.69">acquire overseas now the purpose of all</text>
  <text start="288.51" dur="6.63">of this is to promote a healthy growth</text>
  <text start="291.75" dur="6.36">of overseas investment and prevent risks</text>
  <text start="295.14" dur="6.15">now what&amp;#39;s risky it&amp;#39;s the United States</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="6.84">it&amp;#39;s all those countries that are in a</text>
  <text start="301.29" dur="6.33">huge amount of debt yes China is inhuman</text>
  <text start="304.95" dur="7.94">in a huge amount of debt also they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="7.95">taking their investments and they are</text>
  <text start="312.89" dur="5.359">transferring it over to the belt and</text>
  <text start="315.57" dur="5.409">road system</text>
  <text start="318.249" dur="6.21">and we can see that if China or when</text>
  <text start="320.979" dur="6.44">China decides to stop investing in the</text>
  <text start="324.459" dur="5.7">United States buying up real estate</text>
  <text start="327.419" dur="7.27">buying up entertainment businesses</text>
  <text start="330.159" dur="6.6">buying up hotels we&amp;#39;re going to be in a</text>
  <text start="334.689" dur="6.18">huge amount of trouble so Chinese</text>
  <text start="336.759" dur="6.06">companies they&amp;#39;ve been given priority to</text>
  <text start="340.869" dur="4.44">invest in overseas commercial real</text>
  <text start="342.819" dur="6.51">estate such as office towers apartment</text>
  <text start="345.309" dur="6.81">buildings hotels they&amp;#39;ve been investing</text>
  <text start="349.329" dur="5.97">in Hollywood and what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="352.119" dur="5.73">here is with the new Chinese guidelines</text>
  <text start="355.299" dur="4.561">they&amp;#39;re going to start pulling this away</text>
  <text start="357.849" dur="3.9">from the United States their investment</text>
  <text start="359.86" dur="5.279">dollars and they&amp;#39;re going to be pouring</text>
  <text start="361.749" dur="7.44">this into those countries involved in</text>
  <text start="365.139" dur="5.88">the belt and Road initiative and the</text>
  <text start="369.189" dur="2.78">United States is going to be left out in</text>
  <text start="371.019" dur="3.96">the cold</text>
  <text start="371.969" dur="4.42">so this is going to be a huge problem</text>
  <text start="374.979" dur="4.14">and we can see why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="376.389" dur="4.74">because they understand that the Belton</text>
  <text start="379.119" dur="4.44">Road and this is their project this is</text>
  <text start="381.129" dur="3.6">going to be the wave of the future here</text>
  <text start="383.559" dur="2.9">in the United States this is not</text>
  <text start="384.729" dur="6.03">benefiting them in any way</text>
  <text start="386.459" dur="7.03">so investments certain investments will</text>
  <text start="390.759" dur="4.41">be restricted they&amp;#39;ll not be able to go</text>
  <text start="393.489" dur="2.61">out into the United States and invest</text>
  <text start="395.169" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re going to have to do it with</text>
  <text start="396.099" dur="4.17">those countries that are involved in the</text>
  <text start="398.649" dur="4.83">belt and road system now David Stockman</text>
  <text start="400.269" dur="5.91">is out there and he is warning about the</text>
  <text start="403.479" dur="4.68">Red Swan and when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="406.179" dur="3.9">could see why he is warning about this</text>
  <text start="408.159" dur="4.14">and you know there&amp;#39;s other reasons why</text>
  <text start="410.079" dur="5.7">this is happening but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="412.299" dur="5.01">right now is that Wall Street is saying</text>
  <text start="415.779" dur="3.41">that you know the global economy is</text>
  <text start="417.309" dur="5.1">accelerating everything is fine</text>
  <text start="419.189" dur="5.59">corporate profits they&amp;#39;re surging but</text>
  <text start="422.409" dur="5.43">what Wall Street is saying it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="424.779" dur="5.28">complete lie what&amp;#39;s actually going on is</text>
  <text start="427.839" dur="5.28">a short-lived global credit growth</text>
  <text start="430.059" dur="5.94">impulse coming from China now if they</text>
  <text start="433.119" dur="7.55">start to pull their investments that is</text>
  <text start="435.999" dur="6.84">the red swan that is the point where</text>
  <text start="440.669" dur="4.03">everything is going to come to a</text>
  <text start="442.839" dur="4.11">screeching halt here in the United</text>
  <text start="444.699" dur="7.201">States and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="446.949" dur="7.741">is that the global economy well it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="451.9" dur="5.07">growing as fast as Wall Street is saying</text>
  <text start="454.69" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s not accelerating as fast as Wall</text>
  <text start="456.97" dur="6.53">Street is saying and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="459.91" dur="5.759">is that China and their debt has grown</text>
  <text start="463.5" dur="3.97">very large just like the United States</text>
  <text start="465.669" dur="3.511">and many other countries but remember</text>
  <text start="467.47" dur="4.949">they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="5.579">they&amp;#39;ve been using the US debt to</text>
  <text start="472.419" dur="3.601">finance other projects now a lot of</text>
  <text start="474.759" dur="3.241">people think oh they&amp;#39;re just building</text>
  <text start="476.02" dur="3.66">apartment buildings and things like that</text>
  <text start="478" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;ve been funneling all this money</text>
  <text start="479.68" dur="3.87">into the belton road because they know</text>
  <text start="481.93" dur="3.54">economically in the future</text>
  <text start="483.55" dur="3.72">this is going to bring in a return</text>
  <text start="485.47" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re setting up something just like</text>
  <text start="487.27" dur="5.25">you invest in a business where you spend</text>
  <text start="489.01" dur="6.24">you know millions of dollars and you are</text>
  <text start="492.52" dur="4.32">in debt for millions of dollars because</text>
  <text start="495.25" dur="4.53">what you&amp;#39;re doing is you&amp;#39;re setting up a</text>
  <text start="496.84" dur="5.579">business to hopefully later on bring in</text>
  <text start="499.78" dur="3.87">a return this is what China has been</text>
  <text start="502.419" dur="3.331">doing now the United States has just</text>
  <text start="503.65" dur="5.01">been pumping you know more and more</text>
  <text start="505.75" dur="5.97">currency creating more and more currency</text>
  <text start="508.66" dur="4.89">and they haven&amp;#39;t been doing anything</text>
  <text start="511.72" dur="3.09">where they&amp;#39;re going to set up any type</text>
  <text start="513.55" dur="3.06">of return setting up any type of</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="5.55">economic system they&amp;#39;re just trying to</text>
  <text start="516.61" dur="8.19">keep everything the same and basically</text>
  <text start="520.36" dur="5.88">using military force in other countries</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="4.44">to do what the United States want</text>
  <text start="526.24" dur="6.469">they&amp;#39;re not using economic negotiations</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="6.21">to better the United States economy and</text>
  <text start="532.709" dur="4.361">China right now realizes this and they</text>
  <text start="535.45" dur="3.389">say you know something we&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="537.07" dur="4.2">the belton Road we&amp;#39;re going to set up</text>
  <text start="538.839" dur="4.201">this whole trade system this is going to</text>
  <text start="541.27" dur="3.96">benefit China it&amp;#39;s going to benefit all</text>
  <text start="543.04" dur="4.26">the other countries and we&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="4.29">away from the United States and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.3" dur="5.37">going to see a lot of countries start to</text>
  <text start="549.52" dur="5.819">do this and we can see that as we move</text>
  <text start="552.67" dur="5.85">forward this is going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="555.339" dur="6.331">problem for the United States and we can</text>
  <text start="558.52" dur="4.74">see already that Kenneth Rogoff a</text>
  <text start="561.67" dur="3.57">professor of the economics at Harvard</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="4.05">University well he&amp;#39;s are already</text>
  <text start="565.24" dur="3.87">recommending to the central bank&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="567.31" dur="3.09">during the next recession it&amp;#39;s funny how</text>
  <text start="569.11" dur="3.63">they keep talking about the next</text>
  <text start="570.4" dur="4.23">recession because we&amp;#39;re already in a</text>
  <text start="572.74" dur="3.48">recession and if the economy is</text>
  <text start="574.63" dur="3.45">recovering and everything is so great</text>
  <text start="576.22" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;ve been talking about the next</text>
  <text start="578.08" dur="5.07">recession the neck the next economic</text>
  <text start="580.15" dur="5.22">crisis quite a bit but what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="583.15" dur="3.24">is during the next recession this</text>
  <text start="585.37" dur="2.969">central banks and this is a</text>
  <text start="586.39" dur="3.449">recommendation coming from him they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="588.339" dur="3.75">going to have to resort to negative</text>
  <text start="589.839" dur="3.481">interest rates and they should prepare</text>
  <text start="592.089" dur="4.021">for it now now they&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="593.32" dur="5.13">this for the for this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="596.11" dur="4.02">they know during the next economic</text>
  <text start="598.45" dur="4.2">crisis because Janet Yellen was out</text>
  <text start="600.13" dur="4.32">there actually saying it during the next</text>
  <text start="602.65" dur="4.439">economic crisis we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="604.45" dur="5.1">go negative the ECB has been saying this</text>
  <text start="607.089" dur="4.951">and they know exactly what is going they</text>
  <text start="609.55" dur="5.28">know that during the next economic</text>
  <text start="612.04" dur="5.76">crisis they have no alternative but to</text>
  <text start="614.83" dur="6.15">bring the interest rates into negative</text>
  <text start="617.8" dur="5.76">territory the increase of</text>
  <text start="620.98" dur="5.1">interest rate snap right now was a</text>
  <text start="623.56" dur="4.77">complete illusion to make people believe</text>
  <text start="626.08" dur="4.259">that the economy was doing well and they</text>
  <text start="628.33" dur="3.96">knew that as they raised the rates just</text>
  <text start="630.339" dur="3.631">a little bit at a time the economy is</text>
  <text start="632.29" dur="3.48">very weak of course they knew that they</text>
  <text start="633.97" dur="4.59">would trigger the economy to deteriorate</text>
  <text start="635.77" dur="5.19">even faster which will enable them to</text>
  <text start="638.56" dur="3.51">then say okay we&amp;#39;re entering a recession</text>
  <text start="640.96" dur="3.12">you know of course they&amp;#39;re gonna point</text>
  <text start="642.07" dur="4.92">the finger someplace else and this would</text>
  <text start="644.08" dur="4.86">give them the permission to bring the</text>
  <text start="646.99" dur="3.27">interest rates to the negative territory</text>
  <text start="648.94" dur="3.089">because people will say please save the</text>
  <text start="650.26" dur="3.84">economy and this is what they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="652.029" dur="4.321">to do also it will allow them to restart</text>
  <text start="654.1" dur="5.1">stimulus to create a lot more currency</text>
  <text start="656.35" dur="4.34">than they have before and this is what</text>
  <text start="659.2" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do now remember</text>
