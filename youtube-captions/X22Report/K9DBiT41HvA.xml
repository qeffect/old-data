  <text start="68.62" dur="5.55">economy let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.74" dur="5.43">collapse financial news now we are</text>
  <text start="74.17" dur="7.16">getting some information from Wall</text>
  <text start="77.17" dur="7.68">Street of all places where many of the</text>
  <text start="81.33" dur="6.88">financial pundits they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="84.85" dur="5.55">this stock market correction and some of</text>
  <text start="88.21" dur="4.26">the bigger banks that are directly</text>
  <text start="90.4" dur="6">connected to the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="92.47" dur="6.72">actually foreshadowing a correction</text>
  <text start="96.4" dur="6.3">coming very very soon now we know Steve</text>
  <text start="99.19" dur="6.74">manoosh n&amp;#39; sent out the signal saying</text>
  <text start="102.7" dur="7.05">that we&amp;#39;re working towards a weak dollar</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="6.76">now he&amp;#39;s a goldman sachs boy and we</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="5.34">understand that the Goldman Sachs JP</text>
  <text start="112.69" dur="4.41">Morgan and the rest they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="115.09" dur="4.92">intertwined into the central bank system</text>
  <text start="117.1" dur="5.13">and again they&amp;#39;re not gonna lose out</text>
  <text start="120.01" dur="3.99">when the market comes down they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="122.23" dur="3.33">to actually make a lot of money because</text>
  <text start="124" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re gonna short the market they know</text>
  <text start="125.56" dur="3.059">exactly when it does come down but</text>
  <text start="127.39" dur="2.31">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all this</text>
  <text start="128.619" dur="4.801">and we&amp;#39;ll talk about this in a little</text>
  <text start="129.7" dur="6.81">bit they&amp;#39;re putting out breadcrumbs</text>
  <text start="133.42" dur="5.849">saying that the market is right for a</text>
  <text start="136.51" dur="5.88">correction we see one coming very very</text>
  <text start="139.269" dur="5.041">soon and there&amp;#39;s definitely going to be</text>
  <text start="142.39" dur="5.16">one there&amp;#39;s like no ifs ands or buts</text>
  <text start="144.31" dur="6.39">about it and we&amp;#39;ll go through what other</text>
  <text start="147.55" dur="5.159">individuals have been saying and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="150.7" dur="4.05">also talking about the yield curve if we</text>
  <text start="152.709" dur="3.81">hit this certain indicator point that</text>
  <text start="154.75" dur="3.959">means things are starting to things are</text>
  <text start="156.519" dur="3.901">going to start to fall apart and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.709" dur="3.09">starting to see that already but if we</text>
  <text start="160.42" dur="2.64">look at the real economy and this is the</text>
  <text start="161.799" dur="2.97">people&amp;#39;s economy I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="3.81">the stock market and yes the stock</text>
  <text start="164.769" dur="4.951">market does play a role in the economy</text>
  <text start="166.87" dur="5.07">that is like the flare that goes up into</text>
  <text start="169.72" dur="6.03">the sky to let everyone know the economy</text>
  <text start="171.94" dur="5.79">is collapsing it&amp;#39;s done because then the</text>
  <text start="175.75" dur="4.26">corporation&amp;#39;s at that point can say well</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="4.2">the market came down things are</text>
  <text start="180.01" dur="4.319">collapsing it gives them permission to</text>
  <text start="181.93" dur="4.04">start laying off people in Mass starting</text>
  <text start="184.329" dur="3.151">to sell some of their assets</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="3.099">restructuring everything</text>
  <text start="187.48" dur="3.47">and this is when everything starts to</text>
  <text start="189.069" dur="4.95">really fall apart and the domino effect</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="4.69">starts to take hold here and things just</text>
  <text start="194.019" dur="3.541">really get out of hand</text>
  <text start="195.64" dur="3.77">but we see already that the retail</text>
  <text start="197.56" dur="4.11">market is a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="4.93">toys-r-us right now they won&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="4.44">release their holiday sales this is the</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="3.899">first time in more than a decade and we</text>
  <text start="206.11" dur="3.75">know they&amp;#39;re bankrupt and they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="208.239" dur="5.101">nervous about releasing these because</text>
  <text start="209.86" dur="5.849">it&amp;#39;s probably absolutely awful we see</text>
  <text start="213.34" dur="5.64">the American savings rate well it</text>
  <text start="215.709" dur="7.11">continued in December where it mana</text>
  <text start="218.98" dur="7.619">sleep pushed up around 0.4% month on</text>
  <text start="222.819" dur="8.151">month but we can see overall right now</text>
  <text start="226.599" dur="9.2">the US savings rate hit a crisis low and</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="8.5">credit card debt is at a crisis high and</text>
  <text start="235.799" dur="6.701">when we look at the overall savings of</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="7.95">the American people we&amp;#39;re at the lowest</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="9.2">level since September of 2005 even we</text>
  <text start="247.42" dur="7.399">are now even below that point of 2008</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="6.219">9:10 coming out of the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="254.819" dur="5.591">which tells us there is definitely</text>
  <text start="257.919" dur="5.22">something wrong here now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.41" dur="5.37">seeing is that things are coming down</text>
  <text start="263.139" dur="5.971">around some of the bankers and I believe</text>
  <text start="265.78" dur="4.949">they&amp;#39;re doing this to say yeah these are</text>
  <text start="269.11" dur="4.619">the people that have been manipulating</text>
  <text start="270.729" dur="6">goal but everything else is absolutely</text>
  <text start="273.729" dur="5.25">fine there&amp;#39;s no other problems because</text>
  <text start="276.729" dur="4.531">as we can see over the many many years</text>
  <text start="278.979" dur="4.021">people have been reporting it Gann has</text>
  <text start="281.26" dur="3.719">been out there and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="283" dur="3.63">yes the precious metal market has been</text>
  <text start="284.979" dur="4.381">manipulated by paper contracts and</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="4.92">things like that and people are starting</text>
  <text start="289.36" dur="4.77">to dig into this and what they&amp;#39;ve come</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="4.98">up with is that there are six traders</text>
  <text start="294.13" dur="5.4">who were just arrested for manipulating</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="6.12">the gold market now currently or</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="6.33">formerly employed by UBS HSBC Deutsche</text>
  <text start="302.65" dur="4.889">Bank no JP Morgan was not named they</text>
  <text start="305.86" dur="3.57">were not touched but I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.539" dur="3.931">happening right now is they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="309.43" dur="4.44">listen these are the banks and</text>
  <text start="311.47" dur="4.59">individuals that were manipulating gold</text>
  <text start="313.87" dur="3.66">it wasn&amp;#39;t JPMorgan Chase it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="3.09">goldman sachs it wasn&amp;#39;t the central</text>
  <text start="317.53" dur="3.229">bankers it wasn&amp;#39;t any of these</text>
  <text start="319.15" dur="3.319">individuals so</text>
  <text start="320.759" dur="4.74">basically they&amp;#39;re off the hook we know</text>
  <text start="322.469" dur="5.76">HSBC they were dealing in money</text>
  <text start="325.499" dur="5.16">laundering UBS Deutsche Bank they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="328.229" dur="5.28">been all fine like 30 million 15 million</text>
  <text start="330.659" dur="4.741">dollars which is absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="333.509" dur="4.47">because we know that the central bank</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="4.859">system we know that they have been</text>
  <text start="337.979" dur="4.8">orchestrating the entire manipulation of</text>
  <text start="340.259" dur="4.53">the precious metals market using the</text>
  <text start="342.779" dur="3.841">paper contracts to drive the price down</text>
  <text start="344.789" dur="4.05">and they&amp;#39;re trying to do the same thing</text>
  <text start="346.62" dur="3.689">with Bitcoin and the crypto markets</text>
  <text start="348.839" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re trying to take control this is</text>
  <text start="350.309" dur="4.651">what the central bankers really like</text>
  <text start="351.809" dur="5.521">they like control of the market they</text>
  <text start="354.96" dur="4.199">like control of the economy and they</text>
  <text start="357.33" dur="4.41">like to steer the economy and everything</text>
  <text start="359.159" dur="6.06">else in the direction they want it to go</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="5.039">now we see that the NAFTA talks well</text>
  <text start="365.219" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re kind of starting to break down</text>
  <text start="366.779" dur="3.6">now of course when it all started out</text>
  <text start="368.969" dur="4.35">this is gonna be great we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="370.379" dur="4.5">renegotiate NAFTA and everything will be</text>
  <text start="373.319" dur="3.72">fantastic actually what Trump party</text>
  <text start="374.879" dur="4.801">really wanted to do was get rid of it</text>
  <text start="377.039" dur="4.62">but you know the way the law was passed</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="3.329">you had to go through Congress and it</text>
  <text start="381.659" dur="4.32">wasn&amp;#39;t just like flipping a switch like</text>
  <text start="383.009" dur="4.41">TPP saying yeah that&amp;#39;s off the drawing</text>
  <text start="385.979" dur="3.69">board right now we&amp;#39;re not going with the</text>
  <text start="387.419" dur="4.65">TPP whatsoever this was a little bit</text>
  <text start="389.669" dur="6.84">tougher so they he allowed them to go in</text>
  <text start="392.069" dur="5.671">and to negotiate NAFTA and lately Trump</text>
  <text start="396.509" dur="3.06">has been coming out there saying that</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="4.259">you know NAFTA we should just get rid of</text>
  <text start="399.569" dur="4.53">it and I think this is where it is all</text>
  <text start="401.999" dur="3.991">headed and I think this is where he</text>
  <text start="404.099" dur="4.891">wanted to go and I think those behind</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="5.219">him the Patriots they don&amp;#39;t want NAFTA</text>
  <text start="408.99" dur="3.84">NAFTA did not help trade here in the</text>
  <text start="411.209" dur="4.29">United States didn&amp;#39;t bring drops unites</text>
  <text start="412.83" dur="5.669">actually we lost about 800,000 jobs with</text>
  <text start="415.499" dur="5.73">NAFTA and right now we can see that the</text>
  <text start="418.499" dur="4.5">talks are breaking down NAFTA countries</text>
  <text start="421.229" dur="4.201">won&amp;#39;t be issuing a joint statement after</text>
  <text start="422.999" dur="4.861">after the Montreal round of talks and</text>
  <text start="425.43" dur="5.099">this is a clear sign that negotiations</text>
  <text start="427.86" dur="5.459">are hardly progressing in a favorable</text>
  <text start="430.529" dur="5.04">cooperative manner and we see that</text>
  <text start="433.319" dur="4.62">things are really going south now and</text>
  <text start="435.569" dur="4.201">this is probably all for the best that</text>
  <text start="437.939" dur="5.72">they don&amp;#39;t work out that they can&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="439.77" dur="7.199">up with any type of you know negotiation</text>
  <text start="443.659" dur="5.74">decision on what NAFTA should be and</text>
  <text start="446.969" dur="6">it&amp;#39;d be better off if we just got rid of</text>
  <text start="449.399" dur="5.22">it altogether we see right now there are</text>
  <text start="452.969" dur="4.65">certain individual</text>
  <text start="454.619" dur="6.48">that made predictions about the u.s.</text>
  <text start="457.619" dur="5.61">bond yields if they are up above two</text>
  <text start="461.099" dur="5.61">point six five percent or 2.63 percent</text>
  <text start="463.229" dur="6.09">or 2.75 percent they all have their own</text>
  <text start="466.709" dur="5.04">predictions it means that things are</text>
  <text start="469.319" dur="5.13">gonna start breaking down now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="471.749" dur="4.68">very interesting is Jeff good luck and</text>
  <text start="474.449" dur="4.73">we mentioned him before he warned that</text>
  <text start="476.429" dur="6.96">if the ten year goes to 2.63 percent</text>
  <text start="479.179" dur="6.94">stocks will be negatively impacted and</text>
  <text start="483.389" dur="6.661">we already see that it&amp;#39;s around two</text>
  <text start="486.119" dur="5.34">point seven zero eight five JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="3.989">was saying that if it hits two point</text>
  <text start="491.459" dur="6.18">seven five that&amp;#39;s when things start to</text>
  <text start="494.039" dur="7.16">break down and we are around that area</text>
  <text start="497.639" dur="8.84">and we can see that all these different</text>
  <text start="501.199" dur="9.101">banking systems Goldman Bank of America</text>
  <text start="506.479" dur="7.09">JP Morgan and the rest they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="510.3" dur="7.32">saying that we are due for a correction</text>
  <text start="513.569" dur="8.34">and it will probably hit in the next</text>
  <text start="517.62" dur="6.599">three months and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="521.909" dur="4.68">they are doing this on purpose I believe</text>
  <text start="524.219" dur="6.54">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="526.589" dur="7.5">trying to push a correction in the</text>
  <text start="530.759" dur="6.361">system they want this they want the</text>
  <text start="534.089" dur="5.461">economy to start to come down they want</text>
  <text start="537.12" dur="4.62">to turn this towards Trump to blame him</text>
  <text start="539.55" dur="4.38">and I believe they&amp;#39;re moving in this</text>
  <text start="541.74" dur="4.32">direction and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="4.529">they&amp;#39;re ready to pull the plug on the</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="4.17">economy we already see the economy</text>
  <text start="548.459" dur="3.961">starting to break down very very quickly</text>
  <text start="550.23" dur="5.76">and they know this and I think what</text>
  <text start="552.42" dur="7.019">Trump wants to do is he wants to take a</text>
  <text start="555.99" dur="5.849">hold of the narrative and switch it</text>
  <text start="559.439" dur="4.441">around and actually blame it on the</text>
  <text start="561.839" dur="5.31">central bank on the banking system on</text>
  <text start="563.88" dur="5.04">this entire system that has been one</text>
  <text start="567.149" dur="3.721">gigantic illusion from the very very</text>
  <text start="568.92" dur="4.74">beginning we could see already up in</text>
  <text start="570.87" dur="4.259">Canada the real estate prices well they</text>
  <text start="573.66" dur="5.669">were the fastest rising in the world</text>
  <text start="575.129" dur="6.991">well all of a sudden they are now the</text>
  <text start="579.329" dur="5.73">fastest declining prices in the world</text>
  <text start="582.12" dur="5.7">and we see that prices are coming down</text>
  <text start="585.059" dur="4.801">very very quickly there and we</text>
  <text start="587.82" dur="5.88">saw this happen here in the United</text>
  <text start="589.86" dur="5.58">States back prior to 2008 where all of a</text>
  <text start="593.7" dur="3.84">sudden the prices of homes were going up</text>
  <text start="595.44" dur="3.45">and up and up they hit a plateau and all</text>
  <text start="597.54" dur="3.18">of a sudden things started to drop very</text>
  <text start="598.89" dur="4.2">very rapidly traffic started to dry up</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="3.93">and Canada is now seeing the same exact</text>
  <text start="603.09" dur="3.9">thing yes prices are still high there</text>
  <text start="604.65" dur="3.9">but it&amp;#39;s dropping dramatically and this</text>
  <text start="606.99" dur="5.52">is not a good sign because this is going</text>
  <text start="608.55" dur="5.94">to lead to a chain reaction which is</text>
  <text start="612.51" dur="4.68">going to start to hit all the different</text>
  <text start="614.49" dur="5.22">economies around the world and we could</text>
  <text start="617.19" dur="4.62">see right now that retail is not doing</text>
  <text start="619.71" dur="4.59">well housing is not doing well and the</text>
  <text start="621.81" dur="4.98">corporate media is out there they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="624.3" dur="5.46">the same page of well the economy&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="4.8">doing that well housing doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="629.76" dur="4.05">like it&amp;#39;s doing that well anymore and</text>
  <text start="631.59" dur="4.82">I&amp;#39;m starting to see all these just this</text>
  <text start="633.81" dur="4.74">different articles all around now</text>
  <text start="636.41" dur="4.81">starting to show that the economy</text>
  <text start="638.55" dur="5.79">slowing it&amp;#39;s not doing well and it looks</text>
  <text start="641.22" dur="5.37">like they&amp;#39;re starting to build up to the</text>
  <text start="644.34" dur="3.39">economy completely coming down and we</text>
  <text start="646.59" dur="3.6">can see already but from the wall street</text>
  <text start="647.73" dur="5.91">people this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="650.19" dur="6.48">push right now manoosh in&amp;#39; with his weak</text>
