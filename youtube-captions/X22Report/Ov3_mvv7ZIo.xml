  <text start="56.239" dur="4.921">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.559" dur="6.871">episode 1577 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is May</text>
  <text start="61.16" dur="5.97">25th 2018 and the tot of the episode is</text>
  <text start="64.43" dur="6.21">the transition away from the dollar has</text>
  <text start="67.13" dur="5.849">just become easier let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="70.64" dur="3.75">economic collapse financial news now in</text>
  <text start="72.979" dur="3.211">the past we&amp;#39;ve been talking about how</text>
  <text start="74.39" dur="4.8">the Federal Reserve the central bankers</text>
  <text start="76.19" dur="4.289">how they demonize gold silver the</text>
  <text start="79.19" dur="4.41">precious metals market and how they</text>
  <text start="80.479" dur="4.731">demonize cryptocurrency and many people</text>
  <text start="83.6" dur="5.159">believe that you know the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="85.21" dur="5.89">that is put out there by the central</text>
  <text start="88.759" dur="5.091">banking system where the deep state to</text>
  <text start="91.1" dur="5.61">trick us into going into that system and</text>
  <text start="93.85" dur="4.84">they think well if we go into that</text>
  <text start="96.71" dur="5.1">system they&amp;#39;ll have full control over it</text>
  <text start="98.69" dur="5.16">well this is a decentralized system and</text>
  <text start="101.81" dur="8.01">the only way they can actually control</text>
  <text start="103.85" dur="10.26">it is to force governments into creating</text>
  <text start="109.82" dur="8.67">laws for us to actually purchase a coin</text>
  <text start="114.11" dur="7.44">that the central bank creates and if</text>
  <text start="118.49" dur="8.219">they can do that yes they will control</text>
  <text start="121.55" dur="7.65">the entire system just like the central</text>
  <text start="126.709" dur="5.191">bank came in created the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="129.2" dur="6.36">Note we were on the gold standard and</text>
  <text start="131.9" dur="6.24">took us off the gold standard and they</text>
  <text start="135.56" dur="3.81">took control of the entire system once</text>
  <text start="138.14" dur="2.97">we&amp;#39;re off the gold standard because</text>
  <text start="139.37" dur="3.93">there was no checks and balances the</text>
  <text start="141.11" dur="6.72">same thing with the crypto market if the</text>
  <text start="143.3" dur="7.47">people make a move and this is a chance</text>
  <text start="147.83" dur="5.64">that we all have if they if the people</text>
  <text start="150.77" dur="5.43">stick together and make a move and say</text>
  <text start="153.47" dur="4.5">listen we have this system we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="3.869">the central bank we don&amp;#39;t even the make</text>
  <text start="157.97" dur="5.94">laws we don&amp;#39;t need them at all the</text>
  <text start="160.069" dur="7.651">central bank disappears and this is the</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="6.719">fork in the road right now this is the</text>
  <text start="167.72" dur="4.26">time where the people around the world</text>
  <text start="170.629" dur="3.661">are going to have to make a decision and</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="6.89">we see that the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="174.29" dur="7.47">other central banks like IMF the Biz ECB</text>
  <text start="178.87" dur="4.39">they&amp;#39;re all out there demonizing</text>
  <text start="181.76" dur="3.059">cryptocurrency and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="183.26" dur="3.39">continue to do this just like they did</text>
  <text start="184.819" dur="3.84">precious metals and what they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="186.65" dur="4.44">so going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="188.659" dur="4.711">to make it look volatile just like with</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="4.349">precious metals it&amp;#39;s a barbarous you</text>
  <text start="193.37" dur="4.459">know relic you don&amp;#39;t really need it</text>
  <text start="195.439" dur="5.731">there&amp;#39;s no reason to have it</text>
  <text start="197.829" dur="6.671">same thing with cryptocurrency they like</text>
  <text start="201.17" dur="4.95">to control things centrally and we see</text>
  <text start="204.5" dur="3.87">already with the Federal Reserve Bank of</text>
  <text start="206.12" dur="4.53">San Francisco they really say released a</text>
  <text start="208.37" dur="4.679">report on May 18th where they discuss</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="5.16">the volatility of the Bitcoin price and</text>
  <text start="213.049" dur="4.681">how Bitcoin should be classified whether</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s a currency security or commodity</text>
  <text start="217.73" dur="5.039">and they&amp;#39;re saying that it really has no</text>
  <text start="220.04" dur="4.619">store value not like the dollar because</text>
  <text start="222.769" dur="4.14">the dollar is backed up by governments</text>
  <text start="224.659" dur="4.41">well that&amp;#39;s because you bribed them and</text>
  <text start="226.909" dur="4.22">they passed laws and the government says</text>
  <text start="229.069" dur="5.521">yeah ok the Federal Reserve Note is a</text>
  <text start="231.129" dur="6.25">currency and the government backs it if</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="4.44">the government says hey we don&amp;#39;t longer</text>
  <text start="237.379" dur="5.101">back the Federal Reserve Note we back</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="7.14">another crypto currency guess what I</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="5.49">guess then it has a store value but it</text>
  <text start="246.17" dur="3.33">depends on how you look at this because</text>
  <text start="247.97" dur="4.139">if the people say it has a store value</text>
  <text start="249.5" dur="4.859">it has a store of value but what the</text>
  <text start="252.109" dur="3.66">central banker is trying to do here this</text>
  <text start="254.359" dur="4.111">is out of the Federal Reserve Bank of</text>
  <text start="255.769" dur="6.241">San Francisco is they&amp;#39;re trying to tell</text>
  <text start="258.47" dur="7.02">the people what they think bitcoin is</text>
  <text start="262.01" dur="5.67">worth now right now bitcoin has been</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="4.23">bobbing up and down and we see through</text>
  <text start="267.68" dur="5.19">Mount GOx they&amp;#39;ve been dumping a huge</text>
  <text start="269.72" dur="5.1">amount of bitcoins selling it off and</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="5.16">every time they&amp;#39;ve done this the price</text>
  <text start="274.82" dur="6">has dropped down and the central bank is</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="7.379">out there they&amp;#39;re telling us that they</text>
  <text start="280.82" dur="7.8">believe that bitcoin should roughly have</text>
  <text start="285.409" dur="5.851">the price of eighteen hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="288.62" dur="5.7">per coin which is actually very close to</text>
  <text start="291.26" dur="4.8">where gold is very interestingly yes</text>
  <text start="294.32" dur="3.719">it&amp;#39;s about five hundred dollars off but</text>
  <text start="296.06" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s around that range isn&amp;#39;t that very</text>
  <text start="298.039" dur="5.13">interesting how this is what they</text>
  <text start="300.71" dur="3.84">believe the prices and what they want to</text>
  <text start="303.169" dur="3.361">do is they want to control and make</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="4.53">everyone think that this is the real</text>
  <text start="306.53" dur="4.859">value of Bitcoin and by doing this</text>
  <text start="309.08" dur="3.75">people are gonna go oh maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="311.389" dur="3.871">hold it anymore maybe it&amp;#39;s gonna go down</text>
  <text start="312.83" dur="3.99">to that price because the central bank</text>
  <text start="315.26" dur="3.66">is coming out and telling everyone that</text>
  <text start="316.82" dur="4.05">this is what it&amp;#39;s worth but</text>
  <text start="318.92" dur="4.11">people decide what it&amp;#39;s worth if people</text>
  <text start="320.87" dur="3.45">decide that hey no it&amp;#39;s not worth 1800s</text>
  <text start="323.03" dur="3.81">I&amp;#39;m gonna hold on to it more people</text>
  <text start="324.32" dur="5.43">purchase it and hold on to it it&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="326.84" dur="5.61">a lot more but they&amp;#39;re trying to control</text>
  <text start="329.75" dur="3.06">the market the central banker went on to</text>
  <text start="332.45" dur="3.51">say</text>
  <text start="332.81" dur="5.91">although bitcoins do not possess any</text>
  <text start="335.96" dur="5.25">real intrinsic value from a commodity</text>
  <text start="338.72" dur="4.38">valuation perspective we can estimate a</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="3.96">hypothetical value based on its</text>
  <text start="343.1" dur="4.2">production costs recent estimates</text>
  <text start="345.17" dur="4.14">regarding the energy involved in mining</text>
  <text start="347.3" dur="3.75">a single Bitcoin by professional energy</text>
  <text start="349.31" dur="4.32">efficient mining rigs put it at about</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="5.7">eighteen hundred dollars one mined in</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="6.3">China where 80% of the currently mined</text>
  <text start="356.75" dur="5.73">bitcoins originate and once again this</text>
  <text start="359.93" dur="4.71">is what the central bankers like to do</text>
  <text start="362.48" dur="4.14">because they only want everyone using</text>
  <text start="364.64" dur="4.2">their currency now they might push</text>
  <text start="366.62" dur="4.53">governments and this is a huge</text>
  <text start="368.84" dur="5.7">possibility I mean they did it with the</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="7.5">dollar where they pushed governments</text>
  <text start="374.54" dur="8.78">into recognizing and installing a</text>
  <text start="378.65" dur="7.53">central bank recognizing their note and</text>
  <text start="383.32" dur="4.81">telling everyone that this is the note</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="3.09">that you&amp;#39;ll be using they can do the</text>
  <text start="388.13" dur="2.28">same thing here they can force</text>
  <text start="389.27" dur="5.37">governments which I believe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="390.41" dur="7.11">trying to do into using a certain coin</text>
  <text start="394.64" dur="7.14">now most likely it will be a central</text>
  <text start="397.52" dur="7.8">banker coin and if all the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.78" dur="5.28">cooperate and say these are the coin</text>
  <text start="405.32" dur="4.89">this this is the coin that you have to</text>
  <text start="407.06" dur="5.16">use the central bankers win but if we</text>
  <text start="410.21" dur="4.35">the people say no no we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="412.22" dur="4.44">using this coin instead and if</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="3.93">businesses say will accept any coin and</text>
  <text start="416.66" dur="5.34">remember we have the atomic swaps</text>
  <text start="418.49" dur="5.64">then the central bankers lose so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="422" dur="4.38">at a point in time where people have to</text>
  <text start="424.13" dur="4.89">make a decision of which way we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="426.38" dur="4.44">to go and I think we should go with</text>
  <text start="429.02" dur="3.96">let&amp;#39;s get rid of the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.82" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s no reason for them there are</text>
  <text start="432.98" dur="2.64">private institutions they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="434.66" dur="3.93">transparent</text>
  <text start="435.62" dur="4.86">we can&amp;#39;t audit them the blockchain is a</text>
  <text start="438.59" dur="4.26">truth machine you can see all the</text>
  <text start="440.48" dur="4.02">transactions you can see what is going</text>
  <text start="442.85" dur="4.65">on no it doesn&amp;#39;t give your name and your</text>
  <text start="444.5" dur="6.18">address and all that stuff but you can</text>
  <text start="447.5" dur="5.22">see where everything is flowing not like</text>
  <text start="450.68" dur="3.42">today in a banking institution or</text>
  <text start="452.72" dur="3.93">with the central bank you have no idea</text>
  <text start="454.1" dur="5.22">where all of this is going even if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.65" dur="6.32">backed by gold you still don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="459.32" dur="6.84">idea why because they&amp;#39;re not transparent</text>
  <text start="462.97" dur="4.78">so we see at this point in time the</text>
  <text start="466.16" dur="2.58">central bankers are doing it at whatever</text>
  <text start="467.75" dur="3.66">they possibly can</text>
  <text start="468.74" dur="4.98">to push us in a certain direction and if</text>

  <text start="524.63" dur="4.14">Mitch which basically lets us know what</text>
  <text start="527.78" dur="3.09">people are thinking</text>
  <text start="528.77" dur="4.89">do they have confidence in the system</text>
  <text start="530.87" dur="4.95">well that&amp;#39;s been declining quite a bit</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="5.55">and if we look at consumers that are</text>
  <text start="535.82" dur="6.51">anticipating income gains well it looks</text>
  <text start="539.21" dur="6.81">like they&amp;#39;re not really anticipating</text>
  <text start="542.33" dur="6.48">income gains and that is declining we</text>
  <text start="546.02" dur="5.79">also see the sentiment tumbled most for</text>
  <text start="548.81" dur="6.06">the wealthiest Americans we also see</text>
  <text start="551.81" dur="5.43">that people are losing confidence in the</text>
  <text start="554.87" dur="5.82">rising stock market and it has been</text>
  <text start="557.24" dur="5.4">dropping for the last month or two and</text>
  <text start="560.69" dur="4.02">people are looking at this saying you</text>
  <text start="562.64" dur="5.31">know how can this be and we need to</text>
  <text start="564.71" dur="5.49">remember one thing here is that all the</text>
  <text start="567.95" dur="3.63">stats that are thrown at us from the Fed</text>
  <text start="570.2" dur="3.81">from the government and everywhere else</text>
  <text start="571.58" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s the same calculations they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="574.01" dur="4.2">using since the financial crisis yes</text>
  <text start="575.9" dur="4.59">they modified them a little bit to make</text>
  <text start="578.21" dur="4.56">and to make them look better to boost</text>
  <text start="580.49" dur="4.86">them up a little bit just like they went</text>
  <text start="582.77" dur="3.86">with GDP they went all the way back to</text>
  <text start="585.35" dur="3.62">the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="586.63" dur="3.56">and they added in research and</text>
  <text start="588.97" dur="3.179">development and other things and</text>
  <text start="590.19" dur="3.37">recalculated everything all the way up</text>
  <text start="592.149" dur="5.13">to the present time to make it look a</text>
  <text start="593.56" dur="5.279">lot better they read unemployment and</text>
  <text start="597.279" dur="4.471">how they figured that out to make</text>
  <text start="598.839" dur="6.031">everything look better and the real</text>
  <text start="601.75" dur="5.67">economy with every day people they</text>
  <text start="604.87" dur="5.37">realized that hey I can&amp;#39;t find that</text>
  <text start="607.42" dur="5.19">high-paying job I got laid off here I</text>
  <text start="610.24" dur="4.38">have two part-time jobs what are they</text>
  <text start="612.61" dur="4.56">talking about the people that are trying</text>
  <text start="614.62" dur="4.68">to purchase houses now are realizing</text>
  <text start="617.17" dur="5.94">that interest rates are going up prices</text>
  <text start="619.3" dur="6.92">are way too high and the salary has not</text>
  <text start="623.11" dur="6.27">kept up with inflation on homes</text>
  <text start="626.22" dur="6.15">inflation on college tuition inflation</text>
  <text start="629.38" dur="6.93">on automobiles and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="632.37" dur="6.459">people are realizing that things are not</text>
  <text start="636.31" dur="5.459">going well at all and we know that we</text>
  <text start="638.829" dur="6.771">are headed towards a transition and</text>
  <text start="641.769" dur="8.43">because with every finance system the</text>
  <text start="645.6" dur="6.7">fiat currency always breaks down they</text>
  <text start="650.199" dur="3.901">create too much debt and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="652.3" dur="5.519">about the central bankers and their</text>
  <text start="654.1" dur="6.21">system ends after 4045 years and they</text>
  <text start="657.819" dur="4.08">need to restart it and what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="660.31" dur="3.6">happening and this has been happening</text>
  <text start="661.899" dur="3.75">for quite a while they&amp;#39;ve been moving</text>
  <text start="663.91" dur="4.2">everything away from the United States</text>
  <text start="665.649" dur="5.961">away from the dollar and this has been</text>
  <text start="668.11" dur="6.029">overtime and we need to remember that</text>
  <text start="671.61" dur="6.399">China just introduced the petrol you</text>
  <text start="674.139" dur="6.991">want and this is only the beginning we</text>
  <text start="678.009" dur="6.211">also have to remember they have the gold</text>
  <text start="681.13" dur="5.97">the gold exchange the other exchanges</text>
  <text start="684.22" dur="7.169">they have the payment system and they</text>
  <text start="687.1" dur="7.919">also purchased the LMA the London metals</text>
  <text start="691.389" dur="5.611">exchange and when Hong Kong exchanges in</text>
  <text start="695.019" dur="5.461">clearing bought the london metal</text>
  <text start="697" dur="6.18">exchange in 2012 all the speculation was</text>
  <text start="700.48" dur="4.89">about the effects on gold trading the</text>
  <text start="703.18" dur="4.23">primary reason for buying the LME was to</text>
  <text start="705.37" dur="5.279">obtain its warehouses and ensure a free</text>
  <text start="707.41" dur="6.39">flow of metals two points in the east</text>
  <text start="710.649" dur="5.94">what it also did was give them control</text>
  <text start="713.8" dur="4.56">over what type and kind of futures</text>
  <text start="716.589" dur="3.75">contracts could be traded or on their</text>
  <text start="718.36" dur="3.93">exchanges no longer with the</text>
  <text start="720.339" dur="3.54">control this very important part of the</text>
  <text start="722.29" dur="5.43">precious metals an industrial metal</text>
  <text start="723.879" dur="6.45">supply chain now we&amp;#39;re seeing the next</text>
  <text start="727.72" dur="5.609">evolution of power of owning the</text>
  <text start="730.329" dur="4.95">exchange after successfully launching a</text>
  <text start="733.329" dur="5.49">yuan denominated gold futures contract</text>
  <text start="735.279" dur="5.91">last year the LME is now preparing to</text>
  <text start="738.819" dur="4.74">issue a range of yuyuan denominated</text>
  <text start="741.189" dur="5.281">metals futures so what does this all</text>
  <text start="743.559" dur="5.551">mean well the Chinese knew exactly what</text>
  <text start="746.47" dur="5.01">they were doing they knew that they were</text>
  <text start="749.11" dur="4.199">going to need this and if you notice</text>
  <text start="751.48" dur="4.769">they&amp;#39;re taking all the different parts</text>
  <text start="753.309" dur="5.041">and buying them up and really not</text>
  <text start="756.249" dur="5.041">changing anything until they needed to</text>
  <text start="758.35" dur="4.44">change it and everyone got very</text>
  <text start="761.29" dur="3.33">comfortable in 2012 saying hey look</text>
  <text start="762.79" dur="4.26">nothing&amp;#39;s being changed everything is</text>
  <text start="764.62" dur="5.61">great but they purchased it for a reason</text>
  <text start="767.05" dur="9.089">they were smart taking over the LME</text>
  <text start="770.23" dur="9.959">allowed the Chinese to have gold traded</text>
  <text start="776.139" dur="5.521">in yuan that was the beginning stage now</text>
  <text start="780.189" dur="3.931">they can do it with the rest of the</text>
  <text start="781.66" dur="5.099">metals so why is this announcement by</text>
  <text start="784.12" dur="5.879">the LME such a big event well let&amp;#39;s look</text>
  <text start="786.759" dur="5.161">at this for a second it removes yet</text>
  <text start="789.999" dur="4.44">another important source of the dollar</text>
  <text start="791.92" dur="4.8">demand from the global financial market</text>
  <text start="794.439" dur="4.44">it creates more demand for the yuan</text>
  <text start="796.72" dur="4.979">which will feed China&amp;#39;s need to expend</text>
  <text start="798.879" dur="5.161">its money supply if it&amp;#39;s to liquefy its</text>
  <text start="801.699" dur="4.23">trade it helps countries circumvent</text>
  <text start="804.04" dur="3.659">sanctions by removing its need to hedge</text>
  <text start="805.929" dur="4.77">in dollars for trade with China it</text>
  <text start="807.699" dur="6.05">provides Europe and Russia a new way to</text>
  <text start="810.699" dur="5.19">avoid tariffs and resist sanctions it</text>
  <text start="813.749" dur="3.7">insulates emerging markets from a</text>
  <text start="815.889" dur="4.26">potential spike in the US dollar as</text>
  <text start="817.449" dur="4.281">China will allow you want to fall versus</text>
  <text start="820.149" dur="4.92">the dollar while keeping its overall</text>
  <text start="821.73" dur="6.729">real effective exchange rate relatively</text>
  <text start="825.069" dur="6.18">stable this leads to one conclusion this</text>
  <text start="828.459" dur="4.651">is a massive assistance to emerging</text>
  <text start="831.249" dur="4.32">market companies with big dollar</text>
  <text start="833.11" dur="5.55">denominated liabilities and what this is</text>
  <text start="835.569" dur="5.82">going to do it&amp;#39;s going to shake up the</text>
  <text start="838.66" dur="6.239">world and this was all done on purpose</text>
  <text start="841.389" dur="6">and it was done over a period of time</text>
  <text start="844.899" dur="5.25">they just didn&amp;#39;t do it yesterday they</text>
  <text start="847.389" dur="6.291">purchased it in 2012 it took them six</text>
  <text start="850.149" dur="5.271">years to get to this point and</text>
  <text start="853.68" dur="4.23">if you look at it and you go back in</text>
  <text start="855.42" dur="4.65">time you can see everything has been</text>
  <text start="857.91" dur="3.75">moved now the central bankers most</text>
  <text start="860.07" dur="4.32">likely they&amp;#39;re gonna want to control all</text>
  <text start="861.66" dur="4.59">this they want to have a hand in this</text>
  <text start="864.39" dur="4.08">now they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not going to come</text>
  <text start="866.25" dur="3.93">out and say okay we we have full control</text>
  <text start="868.47" dur="2.7">we&amp;#39;re gonna create currency like crazy</text>
  <text start="870.18" dur="2.67">you know they&amp;#39;re gonna make it look like</text>
  <text start="871.17" dur="3.479">it&amp;#39;s a stabilized system in the</text>
  <text start="872.85" dur="5.31">beginning just like they did in the US</text>
  <text start="874.649" dur="6.75">it&amp;#39;ll be gold backed or gold confidence</text>
  <text start="878.16" dur="5.1">supporting whatever currency it is maybe</text>
  <text start="881.399" dur="5.041">at the low level people using crypto</text>
  <text start="883.26" dur="4.86">currencies and the crypto currencies if</text>
  <text start="886.44" dur="4.89">the central bankers have their way it</text>
  <text start="888.12" dur="5.7">will be controlled by them if the people</text>
  <text start="891.33" dur="4.35">have their way this will not be a</text>
  <text start="893.82" dur="3.42">central bank system and crypto</text>
  <text start="895.68" dur="3.39">currencies will not be controlled by</text>
  <text start="897.24" dur="4.62">central bank&amp;#39;s and this is the main</text>
  <text start="899.07" dur="4.829">point here is that the people of the</text>
  <text start="901.86" dur="5.22">world need to make a decision we have a</text>
  <text start="903.899" dur="6.06">chance right now to break away now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="907.08" dur="4.92">very interesting is that the new Federal</text>
  <text start="909.959" dur="6.841">Reserve Bank chairman this is a Jerome</text>
  <text start="912" dur="8.43">Powell on Friday issued a warning to</text>
  <text start="916.8" dur="6.96">Trump not to interfere with interest</text>
  <text start="920.43" dur="6.81">rate policy now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="923.76" dur="6.12">because he was talking about what</text>
  <text start="927.24" dur="4.77">happened with Nixon in the lead-up to</text>
  <text start="929.88" dur="4.56">the 1972 presidential election to keep</text>
  <text start="932.01" dur="6.24">interest rates very low and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="934.44" dur="5.82">you know don&amp;#39;t do this don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="938.25" dur="5.339">involved the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="940.26" dur="5.79">independent and government shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="943.589" dur="5.971">involved which is very interesting so</text>
  <text start="946.05" dur="5.81">why in the world right now is he putting</text>
  <text start="949.56" dur="5.61">out this warning why is he doing it now</text>
  <text start="951.86" dur="6.25">was there a move or did he learn of a</text>
  <text start="955.17" dur="4.71">move where maybe they&amp;#39;re coming after</text>
  <text start="958.11" dur="4.29">the Federal Reserve to audit the Federal</text>
  <text start="959.88" dur="4.079">Reserve are they looking to remove the</text>
  <text start="962.4" dur="2.97">Federal Reserve because you have to</text>
  <text start="963.959" dur="3.961">remember and I&amp;#39;ve said this many many</text>
  <text start="965.37" dur="5.67">times before Andrew Jackson is hanging</text>
  <text start="967.92" dur="5.01">on the wall of trumps office and he is</text>

  <text start="972.93" dur="3.93">central banks he campaigned on it and I</text>
  <text start="975.24" dur="3.78">believe this is the direction we are</text>
  <text start="976.86" dur="4.71">headed and we can see already there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="979.02" dur="5.069">warning out there not to mess with the</text>
  <text start="981.57" dur="4.12">Federal Reserve and he was very clear in</text>

  <text start="991.09" dur="6.36">dictate anything to the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="994.05" dur="6.46">so you can see that we are headed</text>
  <text start="997.45" dur="4.83">towards a transition China will be</text>
  <text start="1000.51" dur="2.94">moving away from the dollar Russia will</text>
