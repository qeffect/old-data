  <text start="266.04" dur="4.2">the United States is propped up because</text>
  <text start="268.95" dur="2.82">we have a central banking system which</text>

  <text start="320.23" dur="11.12">he has the magic one and he wants to</text>
  <text start="325.36" dur="10.73">know why the World Bank is loaning money</text>
  <text start="331.35" dur="7.21">to China he tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="336.09" dur="4.45">why is the World Bank loaning money to</text>
  <text start="338.56" dur="4.35">China can this be possible</text>

  <text start="351.04" dur="4.86">China creating their own currency that</text>
  <text start="353.47" dur="4.92">will devalue their currency so what are</text>
  <text start="355.9" dur="5.76">they doing they&amp;#39;re borrowing the money</text>
  <text start="358.39" dur="5.16">from the central bank system you think</text>
  <text start="361.66" dur="5.73">the central bank system is trying to</text>
  <text start="363.55" dur="6.84">keep their system going absolutely and</text>
  <text start="367.39" dur="7.92">they will do anything possible to keep</text>
  <text start="370.39" dur="8.9">their system going this is what the</text>
  <text start="375.31" dur="9.57">Patriots are bringing down this entire</text>
  <text start="379.29" dur="7.78">global network and everything that they</text>
  <text start="384.88" dur="5.16">put in place over the many many years</text>

  <text start="390.04" dur="5.52">be put in place before we can move</text>
  <text start="392.38" dur="5.85">forward and I do believe that Trump he</text>
  <text start="395.56" dur="5.7">needs to be reelected so he can then</text>
  <text start="398.23" dur="7.73">move forward with the plan now the deep</text>
  <text start="401.26" dur="8.25">state the central bankers those players</text>
  <text start="405.96" dur="7.12">they are getting worried about what</text>
  <text start="409.51" dur="6.7">Trump is trying to do here how do we</text>
  <text start="413.08" dur="6.58">know this well</text>
  <text start="416.21" dur="6.41">they usually make some type of comment</text>
  <text start="419.66" dur="5.82">about what is Trump what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="422.62" dur="6.01">Biden was out there and with all the</text>
  <text start="425.48" dur="6.45">troubles that he has he decided to say</text>
  <text start="428.63" dur="8.4">something about Trump and the Federal</text>
  <text start="431.93" dur="7.29">Reserve Biden came out and he said that</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="5.97">attacks on the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="439.22" dur="7.56">Chairman Jerome Powell are an abuse of</text>
  <text start="443" dur="6.48">power the president should not be trying</text>
  <text start="446.78" dur="5.96">to pressure the Fed that&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="449.48" dur="6.48">be an independent entity out here</text>
  <text start="452.74" dur="6.76">no the Federal Reserve is not supposed</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="5.1">to be an independent entity it was never</text>
  <text start="459.5" dur="5.43">supposed to be really an independent</text>
  <text start="461.06" dur="9.18">entity they made it into an independent</text>
  <text start="464.93" dur="10.92">entity because this was the source of</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="10.16">all of their funds if the central bank</text>
  <text start="475.85" dur="8.75">system disappears their entire apparatus</text>
  <text start="480.4" dur="8.08">falls apart let&amp;#39;s reverse a little bit</text>
  <text start="484.6" dur="8.14">why did the deep State and those in</text>
  <text start="488.48" dur="7.65">power why did they have regime change in</text>
  <text start="492.74" dur="5.91">the Middle East in all those countries</text>
  <text start="496.13" dur="3.78">where the deal was made that listen the</text>
  <text start="498.65" dur="5.04">United States will protect you as long</text>
  <text start="499.91" dur="7.47">as you sell the oil using the dollar why</text>
  <text start="503.69" dur="6.47">did they move ahead and why did they</text>
  <text start="507.38" dur="7.05">have regime change in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="510.16" dur="8.02">the reason is because those leaders they</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="6.45">were no longer using the dollar they</text>
  <text start="518.18" dur="5.79">decided to use different currency or</text>
  <text start="520.88" dur="4.98">gold and said to other countries listen</text>
  <text start="523.97" dur="6.42">you can use whatever you want to</text>
  <text start="525.86" dur="7.29">purchase this oil the deep state the</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="4.31">central bankers could not allow this to</text>
  <text start="533.15" dur="4.02">happen</text>
  <text start="534.7" dur="6.19">their entire system would fall apart</text>
  <text start="537.17" dur="6.3">this is why they made a plan to go in</text>
  <text start="540.89" dur="5.93">and keep the status quo everything that</text>
  <text start="543.47" dur="6.39">Kissinger set up this is what they did</text>
  <text start="546.82" dur="5.44">now it is all falling apart</text>
  <text start="549.86" dur="6.33">all they have left is the Federal</text>
  <text start="552.26" dur="8.19">Reserve the entire Middle East apparatus</text>
  <text start="556.19" dur="7.05">is being dismantled right now and what</text>
  <text start="560.45" dur="5.579">that means is countries no longer need</text>
  <text start="563.24" dur="4.23">to keep the dollar in reserves if the</text>
  <text start="566.029" dur="4.921">country&amp;#39;s no longer need to keep the</text>
  <text start="567.47" dur="6.179">dollar in reserves those dollars come</text>
  <text start="570.95" dur="5.16">flooding back to the United States Trump</text>
  <text start="573.649" dur="6.031">the Patriots they are putting forth a</text>
  <text start="576.11" dur="5.729">plan to make sure that when the central</text>
  <text start="579.68" dur="4.38">bank system and Trump already mentioned</text>
  <text start="581.839" dur="5.31">that the rest or the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="584.06" dur="5.43">is falling apart before that comes back</text>
  <text start="587.149" dur="5.13">and hits the United States because like</text>
  <text start="589.49" dur="5.159">we&amp;#39;ve said many many times before it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="592.279" dur="4.891">going to hit the rest of the world first</text>
  <text start="594.649" dur="4.68">and then come back to the source what is</text>
  <text start="597.17" dur="5.25">the source it is the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="599.329" dur="6.391">it&amp;#39;s the IMF it&amp;#39;s the biz leading all</text>
  <text start="602.42" dur="6.33">the way up to the Rothschild the</text>
  <text start="605.72" dur="8.01">Rothschild banking system which controls</text>
  <text start="608.75" dur="7.17">it all and it&amp;#39;s time to remove all this</text>
  <text start="613.73" dur="4.68">and they&amp;#39;re becoming a little nervous</text>
  <text start="615.92" dur="5.43">about this they&amp;#39;re panicking and you can</text>
  <text start="618.41" dur="5.669">hear it because once they come out and</text>
  <text start="621.35" dur="6.45">they say these things you can see what</text>
  <text start="624.079" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;re trying to protect and that time</text>

  <text start="651.26" dur="6.29">and then purchases items in Europe this</text>
  <text start="655.07" dur="4.23">is how they had this system working</text>
  <text start="657.55" dur="3.52">eventually they were going to change</text>
  <text start="659.3" dur="3.42">this all because they were gonna move</text>
