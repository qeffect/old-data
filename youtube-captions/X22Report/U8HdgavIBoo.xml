  <text start="133.08" dur="3.54">world</text>
  <text start="133.409" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re completely exposed and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="136.62" dur="4.259">trying to blame all of this on Trump but</text>
  <text start="138.569" dur="5.401">when you look at the US the stats show</text>
  <text start="140.879" dur="5.491">the u.s. is doing very very well so it</text>
  <text start="143.97" dur="4.68">really makes no sense that it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="4.89">of Trump of yes they&amp;#39;re trying to use as</text>

  <text start="151.26" dur="3.929">happening it&amp;#39;s the trade wars but when</text>
  <text start="153.599" dur="3.81">you look back in time and you look at</text>
  <text start="155.189" dur="3.27">the GDP numbers of the world and you</text>
  <text start="157.409" dur="4.771">look at all the stats they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="158.459" dur="6.481">declining way before Trump and the</text>
  <text start="162.18" dur="5.91">economy is not doing worse</text>
  <text start="164.94" dur="6.6">of Trump it is the way the central bank</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="5.58">system is designed they&amp;#39;re exposed now</text>
  <text start="171.54" dur="5.78">and they&amp;#39;re nervous they&amp;#39;re afraid</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="7.62">they&amp;#39;re panicking Trump in the Patriots</text>
  <text start="177.32" dur="5.92">they are keeping the central bank system</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="4.68">operational here in the United States</text>
  <text start="183.24" dur="5.88">which then moves to the rest of the</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="4.95">world because United States right now</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="4.95">because of the Federal Reserve Note is</text>
  <text start="190.92" dur="5.46">the reserve currency the rest of the</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="5.19">world is really in trouble</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="5.46">they have been for a long time and they</text>
  <text start="199.26" dur="5.61">were deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="201.84" dur="4.95">this is why the central bankers the deep</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="4.05">say the mainstream media this is why</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="5.58">they plan to raise rates during the</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="6.45">presidency of Trump until Trump took</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="5.7">over the Patriots took over and dictated</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="6.54">what the Fed should do if they continued</text>
  <text start="218.07" dur="5.7">to raise rates throughout 2019 going</text>
  <text start="221.91" dur="5.61">into 2020 the ECB was going to follow</text>
  <text start="223.77" dur="8.36">along with stimulus the entire economic</text>
  <text start="227.52" dur="8.07">system would have imploded on itself</text>
  <text start="232.13" dur="5.74">around 2020 that&amp;#39;s why the mainstream</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="4.2">media was out there reporting on this</text>
  <text start="237.87" dur="4.17">saying yes we&amp;#39;re going to have a</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="4.74">recession when it didn&amp;#39;t happen they</text>
  <text start="242.04" dur="4.53">tried to push it with telling everyone</text>
  <text start="244.53" dur="4.92">that there&amp;#39;s going to be recession</text>
  <text start="246.57" dur="5.21">hoping that everyone would become scared</text>
  <text start="249.45" dur="4.98">and afraid and not spend their money</text>
  <text start="251.78" dur="6.61">this is what they tried to do because</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="8.37">71% of GDP is made up of people going</text>
  <text start="258.39" dur="8.64">out and spending their money Trump what</text>
  <text start="262.8" dur="8.25">he did is he kind of countered all of</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="7.68">this how does he do this he needed to</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="7.59">put cash back in the pockets of the</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="5.37">everyday person and what the deep state</text>
  <text start="278.64" dur="3.12">and the central bankers have been doing</text>
  <text start="280.08" dur="4.05">is they&amp;#39;ve been adding more and more</text>
  <text start="281.76" dur="4.59">regulations they&amp;#39;ve been adding more and</text>
  <text start="284.13" dur="5.28">more taxes like the Obamacare tax</text>
  <text start="286.35" dur="7.02">penalty and what did that do it allowed</text>
  <text start="289.41" dur="5.3">people to have extra currency in their</text>
  <text start="293.37" dur="4.37">wallet</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="6.78">that&amp;#39;s what it allowed that everyone to</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="7.23">have when the tax penalty disappears</text>
  <text start="301.49" dur="6.899">this year what does that do it allows</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="7.949">the everyday person to have more funds</text>
  <text start="308.389" dur="8.761">in their pocket think about what he had</text>
  <text start="312.919" dur="8.09">to do he had to undo the regulations the</text>
  <text start="317.15" dur="7.5">taxes to allow the people to have more</text>
  <text start="321.009" dur="7.481">currency in their bank in their wallet</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="8.91">wherever and he had to do this because</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="7.35">the people were being squeezed and what</text>
  <text start="333.56" dur="5.01">he did was he reversed all of this now</text>
  <text start="335.84" dur="4.65">the World Trade Organization they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="5.67">there and they&amp;#39;re letting everyone know</text>
  <text start="340.49" dur="7.739">that they need to change their</text>
  <text start="344.24" dur="7.83">predictions they said a darkening</text>
  <text start="348.229" dur="6.801">outlook for trade is discouraging now</text>
  <text start="352.07" dur="6.96">when you look at the World Trade</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="8.56">Organization and their outlook and you</text>
  <text start="359.03" dur="7.259">go back to 2011 from 2011 moving the</text>
  <text start="363.59" dur="6.06">2016 it was declining when Trump got</text>
  <text start="366.289" dur="7.171">elected it bounced up now it&amp;#39;s declining</text>
  <text start="369.65" dur="7.88">once again and the reason why it bounced</text>
  <text start="373.46" dur="6.75">up is because the people saw hope</text>
  <text start="377.53" dur="5.979">countries around the world saw hope but</text>
  <text start="380.21" dur="6.54">again that only lasts so long and then</text>
  <text start="383.509" dur="4.851">the trajectory continues downward and</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="6.21">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="388.36" dur="8.83">because in 2018 2019 that&amp;#39;s when the</text>
  <text start="392.96" dur="6.389">tariffs really came into play and when</text>
  <text start="397.19" dur="5.13">you look at this you can see that we</text>
  <text start="399.349" dur="6.121">were in a place where everything was</text>
  <text start="402.32" dur="4.98">heading south and we see this with the</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="4.22">IMF and the rest of the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="407.3" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s not like this is something new and</text>
  <text start="409.69" dur="4.03">we need to remember that this is a</text>
  <text start="411.68" dur="4.049">central bank globalist system that is</text>
  <text start="413.72" dur="4.68">failing this is exactly what the</text>
  <text start="415.729" dur="6.06">Patriots are pushing for they want the</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="6.9">central banking system to fail they want</text>
  <text start="421.789" dur="5.791">them completely exposed how is this</text>
  <text start="425.3" dur="3.06">going to happen most likely it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="427.58" dur="3.03">to happen out</text>
  <text start="428.36" dur="3.899">in Europe and around the world first and</text>
  <text start="430.61" dur="4.799">then it will come back here to the</text>
  <text start="432.259" dur="5.761">United States but again the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="435.409" dur="4.32">planning to transition us out of this</text>
  <text start="438.02" dur="3.679">central bank system this is what this is</text>
  <text start="439.729" dur="5.551">all about this is about this is what</text>
  <text start="441.699" dur="5.801">deregulation and cutting the tax</text>
  <text start="445.28" dur="4.77">regulations in half and allowing people</text>
  <text start="447.5" dur="6.06">to have more currency it&amp;#39;s letting</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="7.739">people prepare for all of this and at</text>
  <text start="453.56" dur="6.359">the same time it is boosting the economy</text>
  <text start="457.789" dur="3.66">like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before think about</text>
  <text start="459.919" dur="4.47">these cutting taxes cutting regulation</text>
  <text start="461.449" dur="7.02">setting up equal trade and what do we</text>
  <text start="464.389" dur="6.361">see happening we see according to the US</text>
  <text start="468.469" dur="5.271">Census Bureau the real median household</text>
  <text start="470.75" dur="6.12">income is at its highest level ever</text>
  <text start="473.74" dur="5.649">after eight years in office Obama was</text>
  <text start="476.87" dur="7.49">able to raise wages only $1,000 per</text>
  <text start="479.389" dur="8.851">household Trump was able to do this</text>
  <text start="484.36" dur="7.899">three times what Obama did he raised it</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="6.959">three thousand more dollars now I wonder</text>
  <text start="492.259" dur="4.921">how Trump was able to do this well he</text>
  <text start="495.199" dur="5.011">deregulated he cut taxes</text>
  <text start="497.18" dur="8.299">he removed the Obamacare tax penalty and</text>
  <text start="500.21" dur="11.31">guess what happens people&amp;#39;s income</text>
  <text start="505.479" dur="9.881">increases what else do we see we see</text>
  <text start="511.52" dur="7.49">Trump bringing back trade making new</text>
  <text start="515.36" dur="7.549">trade deals bringing back manufacturers</text>
  <text start="519.01" dur="7.09">making trade equal around the world now</text>
  <text start="522.909" dur="7.091">we had some poor manufacturing numbers</text>
  <text start="526.1" dur="6.979">come in and Trump is blaming the Fed</text>
  <text start="530" dur="7.26">saying listen the dollar is way too high</text>
  <text start="533.079" dur="6.221">I&amp;#39;ve told you this before and we see the</text>
  <text start="537.26" dur="3.12">ECB cutting interest rates there in the</text>
  <text start="539.3" dur="3.539">negative territory actually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="6.69">negative 0.6% the United States is</text>
  <text start="542.839" dur="8.041">between 1.75 and 2% think about this for</text>
  <text start="547.07" dur="7.56">a sec they&amp;#39;ve started stimulus we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="550.88" dur="6.689">started stimulus and the dollar is too</text>
  <text start="554.63" dur="6.269">strong when the dollar is strong what</text>
  <text start="557.569" dur="4.441">happens well a strong $1 makes US</text>
  <text start="560.899" dur="3.811">exports less a try</text>
  <text start="562.01" dur="5.37">to foreign buyers because they become</text>
  <text start="564.71" dur="3.9">more expensive this is why Trump is</text>
  <text start="567.38" dur="4.71">saying listen if we&amp;#39;re going to compete</text>
  <text start="568.61" dur="7.05">we need to do what the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="572.09" dur="5.67">is doing and the central bank is not</text>
  <text start="575.66" dur="4.53">reacting fast enough so Trump tweeted</text>
  <text start="577.76" dur="3.96">out the following as I predicted Jay</text>
  <text start="580.19" dur="3.03">Powell and the Federal Reserve have</text>
  <text start="581.72" dur="3.21">allowed the dollar to get so strong</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="3.93">especially relative to all other</text>
  <text start="584.93" dur="4.89">currencies that our manufacturers are</text>
  <text start="587.15" dur="5.7">being negatively affected fed fed rate</text>
  <text start="589.82" dur="7.02">too high they are their own worst enemy</text>
  <text start="592.85" dur="8.76">they don&amp;#39;t have a clue pathetic now</text>
  <text start="596.84" dur="8.61">remember the Fed they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="601.61" dur="7.65">the US economy they don&amp;#39;t really care</text>
  <text start="605.45" dur="8.16">about the world economy what they care</text>
  <text start="609.26" dur="7.19">about is their system their system of</text>
  <text start="613.61" dur="5.4">debt and making a profit and controlling</text>
  <text start="616.45" dur="5.95">nations and governments and people</text>
  <text start="619.01" dur="6.6">that&amp;#39;s what they care about and what</text>
  <text start="622.4" dur="5.82">Trump is doing right now is he&amp;#39;s hitting</text>
  <text start="625.61" dur="6.6">the Fed letting the entire country and</text>
  <text start="628.22" dur="6.75">the world letting them know that the Fed</text>
  <text start="632.21" dur="5.64">doesn&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re really doing</text>
  <text start="634.97" dur="5.7">with the economy they never have they</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="6.42">never worked in the best interest of the</text>
  <text start="640.67" dur="7.41">people so when he says that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="644.27" dur="6.75">not doing what I want they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="648.08" dur="6.48">clue they&amp;#39;re pathetic what he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="651.02" dur="7.88">saying is that the Fed was never working</text>
  <text start="654.56" dur="7.68">for you never working for this country</text>
  <text start="658.9" dur="6.4">they don&amp;#39;t have a clue of what the</text>
  <text start="662.24" dur="5.91">people need or want because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="665.3" dur="5.76">want to know that they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="668.15" dur="6.06">that they don&amp;#39;t have an allegiance to a</text>
  <text start="671.06" dur="4.62">people a country or any group the only</text>
  <text start="674.21" dur="6.06">group they have an allegiance to is</text>
  <text start="675.68" dur="9.18">themselves and Trump is letting everyone</text>
  <text start="680.27" dur="6.9">know that it&amp;#39;s because of the Fed that</text>
  <text start="684.86" dur="4.65">the economy is not doing well now think</text>
  <text start="687.17" dur="4.92">about that because of what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="689.51" dur="5.67">doing the economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="692.09" dur="5.85">would it be better off to have no</text>
  <text start="695.18" dur="4.77">fed whatsoever most likely yes this is</text>
  <text start="697.94" dur="5.16">why Trump is having the Fed bring down</text>
  <text start="699.95" dur="5.01">the interest rates to zero he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="703.1" dur="5.04">have to deal with them when they&amp;#39;re at</text>
