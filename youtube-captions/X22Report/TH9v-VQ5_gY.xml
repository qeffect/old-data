  <text start="262.54" dur="7.65">they virtually have no debt whatsoever</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="7.78">China has been using all of this fiat</text>
  <text start="270.19" dur="5.88">currency to build a new system this is</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="4.679">the Silk Road and Trump he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="276.07" dur="5.61">creating bilateral free trade agreements</text>
  <text start="278.229" dur="5.431">with many countries the UK is going to</text>
  <text start="281.68" dur="4.65">be another country once they leave the</text>
  <text start="283.66" dur="5.34">EU and when other countries leave the EU</text>

  <text start="297.38" dur="7.12">they&amp;#39;re actually on a on friendly terms</text>
  <text start="301.28" dur="6.34">Trump was talking to reporters at the g7</text>
  <text start="304.5" dur="5.58">he was answering questions and he said</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="5.49">the following he said it&amp;#39;s a brilliant</text>
  <text start="310.08" dur="3.57">market the Chinese market the world</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="2.22">market</text>
  <text start="313.65" dur="3.9">a lot of markets are brilliant and</text>
  <text start="315.33" dur="5.28">frankly I think that China I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="4.8">maybe they can maybe they can&amp;#39;t I think</text>
  <text start="320.61" dur="3.72">they are very smart and I think</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="4.35">President Xi is a great leader who</text>
  <text start="324.33" dur="5.25">happens to be a brilliant man and he</text>
  <text start="326.7" dur="6.09">can&amp;#39;t lose three million jobs in a very</text>
  <text start="329.58" dur="5.34">short period of time Trump started</text>
  <text start="332.79" dur="4.77">telling reporters at the summit that he</text>
  <text start="334.92" dur="5.55">wants to make a deal very badly with</text>
  <text start="337.56" dur="6.36">China the vice chairman of China came</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="6.86">out that he wants to see a deal made he</text>
  <text start="343.92" dur="6.63">wants to be made under a calm conditions</text>
  <text start="347.33" dur="6.43">using the word calm Trump says I agree</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="5.88">with him I agree with him on the word</text>
  <text start="353.76" dur="5.88">come they have lost three million jobs</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="6.09">soon will be much more than 3 million</text>
  <text start="359.64" dur="5.46">jobs the chain is breaking up like</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="4.95">nobody has seen before and once that</text>
  <text start="365.1" dur="6.48">happens it&amp;#39;s very hard to put it back</text>
  <text start="367.47" dur="7.17">together and Trump understands that they</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="4.85">will eventually make the deal everything</text>
  <text start="374.64" dur="6.15">that we&amp;#39;re watching right now</text>
  <text start="376.43" dur="8.62">everything that we&amp;#39;re looking at is put</text>
  <text start="380.79" dur="7.92">into place to reset the globalist</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="7.32">central bank system this is why Trump at</text>
  <text start="388.71" dur="8.03">the g7 he wants Russia to be brought</text>
  <text start="392.37" dur="8.25">back into the g7 they were thrown out</text>
  <text start="396.74" dur="7.26">Russia is not the enemy Trump knows this</text>
  <text start="400.62" dur="8.13">and what we are watching right now is</text>
  <text start="404" dur="9.22">the reset of the global economic system</text>
  <text start="408.75" dur="6.6">we&amp;#39;re watching it in real time and it is</text>
  <text start="413.22" dur="6.33">like a show now think about it if we go</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="7.59">back to 1971 you were watching a show</text>
  <text start="419.55" dur="6.54">back then and this was the globalist</text>
  <text start="422.94" dur="6.84">central bank show and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="426.09" dur="4.92">media was reporting on what they were</text>
  <text start="429.78" dur="5.19">telling them to report</text>

  <text start="452.1" dur="6.57">this oil from the Middle East other</text>
  <text start="454.83" dur="6.24">countries will purchase the oil using US</text>
  <text start="458.67" dur="5.58">dollars that&amp;#39;s the only thing they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="461.07" dur="6.09">able to sell the oil in well that was a</text>
  <text start="464.25" dur="7.76">show back then and that was to move us</text>
  <text start="467.16" dur="10.97">out of a gold back system into a full-on</text>

  <text start="564.99" dur="6.24">that are being made once the UK breaks</text>
  <text start="568.2" dur="5.49">off from the EU you&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="571.23" dur="4.98">domino effect with many of the countries</text>
  <text start="573.69" dur="4.71">now is it going to happen the next day</text>

  <text start="580.08" dur="5.22">bit to see how it all plays out but</text>
  <text start="583.05" dur="4.23">since Trump and bourse they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="585.3" dur="3.51">out this interim trade deal they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="587.28" dur="4.98">gonna see things happen very very</text>
  <text start="588.81" dur="6.15">quickly then other countries will react</text>
  <text start="592.26" dur="5.31">let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s Italy that says you know</text>
  <text start="594.96" dur="5.37">something we&amp;#39;re also leaving once that</text>

  <text start="602.37" dur="4.95">steps up and everyone goes back to their</text>
  <text start="604.74" dur="4.38">own currency creating their own currency</text>
  <text start="607.32" dur="4.02">maybe these countries will say you know</text>
  <text start="609.12" dur="4.02">something we&amp;#39;re so far into debt</text>
  <text start="611.34" dur="4.34">maybe we should all agree going back to</text>

  <text start="627.08" dur="8.71">nothing there are no paper contracts</text>
  <text start="631.64" dur="5.79">thrown at the gold market to bring down</text>
  <text start="635.79" dur="4.32">the gold price like we&amp;#39;ve seen before</text>
  <text start="637.43" dur="6.07">actually if you look gold is now up to</text>
  <text start="640.11" dur="7.08">1536 yes it Bob&amp;#39;s up and down but as you</text>
  <text start="643.5" dur="6.39">can see it&amp;#39;s continually moving upwards</text>

  <text start="689.73" dur="5.049">manipulating the entire economics</text>
  <text start="692.68" dur="6.23">and to make you think that their fiat</text>
  <text start="694.779" dur="8">currency still has value it doesn&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="698.91" dur="6.79">when the gold price continually rises</text>
  <text start="702.779" dur="4.931">everyone&amp;#39;s going to reals realize this</text>
