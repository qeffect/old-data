  <text start="39.39" dur="6.12">fourteenth 2016 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="42.24" dur="6.44">episode is red flags everywhere central</text>
  <text start="45.51" dur="5.88">bank&amp;#39;s admit the economy is collapsing</text>
  <text start="48.68" dur="5.59">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="51.39" dur="5.34">financial news now today we see the</text>
  <text start="54.27" dur="4.8">market is being pushed up once again and</text>
  <text start="56.73" dur="4.77">if you notice since we&amp;#39;re moving closer</text>
  <text start="59.07" dur="4.1">and closer to the elections if you</text>
  <text start="61.5" dur="6.05">notice the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="63.17" dur="9.07">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing the stock market</text>
  <text start="67.55" dur="7.45">the Dow the sp500 as high as it possibly</text>
  <text start="72.24" dur="5.01">can go as we get closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="75" dur="5.64">this economy falling apart they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="77.25" dur="6.72">pushing the stock market down the sp500</text>
  <text start="80.64" dur="5.46">the Nasdaq to highs that we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="4.65">even seen before they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="86.1" dur="4.59">suppressing gold and silver which makes</text>
  <text start="88.62" dur="4.14">sense at this point which we knew this</text>
  <text start="90.69" dur="6.84">was going to happen they will</text>
  <text start="92.76" dur="8.3">continually use the stock market to</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="6.72">convince everyone that this economy is</text>
  <text start="101.06" dur="5.14">doing incredibly well they&amp;#39;ll do it up</text>
  <text start="104.25" dur="3.6">to the very end and even when this</text>
  <text start="106.2" dur="4.77">market is coming down when the whole and</text>
  <text start="107.85" dur="5.24">caught economy is crashing they will</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="7.22">still try to convince the population</text>
  <text start="113.09" dur="8.14">that it&amp;#39;s okay don&amp;#39;t worry about it and</text>
  <text start="118.19" dur="4.33">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of anomalies we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="121.23" dur="3.6">seeing a lot of their statistical</text>
  <text start="122.52" dur="4.4">information it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense when</text>
  <text start="124.83" dur="5.549">we look at initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="126.92" dur="7.24">despite six months of deteriorating</text>
  <text start="130.379" dur="9.561">labor market conditions the feds 19</text>
  <text start="134.16" dur="9.049">factor experimental model shows the</text>
  <text start="139.94" dur="7.21">opposite of what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="143.209" dur="8.381">now we&amp;#39;re at 43 year lows for initial</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="8.009">jobless claims so who is telling us the</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="4.649">truth here is it the feds model that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.159" dur="4.021">showing us that the labor market</text>
  <text start="156.239" dur="4.231">conditions are deteriorating or is the</text>
  <text start="159.18" dur="3.42">Department of Labor telling us the truth</text>
  <text start="160.47" dur="3.08">where it shows that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="162.6" dur="6.74">and</text>
  <text start="163.55" dur="7.17">the job market is doing well well when</text>
  <text start="169.34" dur="5.73">we look at what&amp;#39;s been going on around</text>
  <text start="170.72" dur="6.8">the country we realize that people have</text>
  <text start="175.07" dur="4.23">lost a lot of jobs in retail</text>
  <text start="177.52" dur="6.97">corporations are laying off by the</text>
  <text start="179.3" dur="8.13">thousands we see everything contracting</text>
  <text start="184.49" dur="8.1">at this point and there&amp;#39;s over a million</text>
  <text start="187.43" dur="8.94">plus people out of work since June of</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="8.85">2014 and the number continually grows</text>
  <text start="196.37" dur="8.91">and we know from the manipulation and</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="5.94">how they calculate unemployment they</text>
  <text start="205.28" dur="5.58">calculated by counting those part-time</text>
  <text start="207.38" dur="5.55">jobs as a full-time job so if you have</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="4.95">two or three part-time which one two</text>
  <text start="212.93" dur="6.24">three full-time if somebody loses a</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="5.22">part-time job well depends on how many</text>
  <text start="219.17" dur="6.12">hours you&amp;#39;ve been working if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="9.78">working less than 25 hours you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="7.05">really counted as losing a job so think</text>
  <text start="230.81" dur="4.649">about this for a second how they</text>
  <text start="232.34" dur="5.88">manipulate these numbers there was a</text>
  <text start="235.459" dur="4.761">study that was done that shows that</text>
  <text start="238.22" dur="5.25">eighty-one percent of u.s. households</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="8.31">they&amp;#39;ve experienced flat or falling</text>
  <text start="243.47" dur="8.03">incomes over the past decade since 2008</text>
  <text start="248.53" dur="7.62">people have not seen their incomes go up</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="9.609">most people have seen their incomes fall</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="8.47">now in this study what were the</text>
  <text start="261.109" dur="6.451">contributors to this well it was the</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="6.99">labor market shifts such as the falling</text>
  <text start="267.56" dur="7.109">wage share of the gdp and the economic</text>
  <text start="271.61" dur="5.46">situation has affected the way many of</text>
  <text start="274.669" dur="5.911">those with flat or falling incomes view</text>
  <text start="277.07" dur="5.46">the global economic system with many of</text>
  <text start="280.58" dur="7.14">the people saying that they lost faith</text>
  <text start="282.53" dur="10.5">in the economic system where the economy</text>
  <text start="287.72" dur="6.98">is continually declining and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="293.03" dur="4.09">talking about this for quite a while and</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="5.39">we&amp;#39;ve been showing proof</text>
  <text start="297.12" dur="8.4">proof after proof fact after fact after</text>
  <text start="300.09" dur="8.37">fact that this is the case now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="305.52" dur="6.08">seeing a little bit of inflation we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.46" dur="7.83">seeing the producer prices they have</text>
  <text start="311.6" dur="6.37">increased up 2.5% over the prior month</text>
  <text start="316.29" dur="6.3">they only expected to increase by 0.3%</text>
  <text start="317.97" dur="8.64">and this is the highest jump since</text>
  <text start="322.59" dur="5.88">December September of 2012 so if we</text>
  <text start="326.61" dur="7.1">exclude food and energy from this it</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="9.84">still moved up point four percent now</text>
  <text start="333.71" dur="7.51">when we look at wholesale inventories we</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="6.72">realize that we&amp;#39;re seeing very very</text>
  <text start="341.22" dur="5.699">similar economic indicators that we saw</text>
  <text start="345.03" dur="6.29">back in two thousand one and two</text>
  <text start="346.919" dur="10.741">thousand eight now wholesale inventories</text>
  <text start="351.32" dur="12.09">they reached above 1.40 in 2001 and in</text>
  <text start="357.66" dur="9.99">2008 and once they reached that point</text>
  <text start="363.41" dur="8.979">some and back in 2008 moved up a little</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="8.34">bit above 1.4 2001 and went to like 1.41</text>
  <text start="372.389" dur="8.21">but as soon as it hit one point for all</text>
  <text start="375.99" dur="10.82">of a sudden everything started to crash</text>
  <text start="380.599" dur="9.161">well we&amp;#39;ve been 16 months above 1.40</text>
  <text start="386.81" dur="6.19">actually back in two thousand eight we</text>
  <text start="389.76" dur="6.5">were eight months above 1.40 and what</text>
  <text start="393" dur="7.68">happened everything came crashing down</text>
  <text start="396.26" dur="9.31">so it looks like we are heading in the</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="7.08">same direction but this time it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="405.57" dur="5.24">to be much worse because the central</text>
  <text start="407.76" dur="8.189">bankers they&amp;#39;re in a holding pattern</text>
  <text start="410.81" dur="8.41">they&amp;#39;re waiting to bring this down when</text>
  <text start="415.949" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s the right time and we know at that</text>
  <text start="419.22" dur="5.79">time is when they&amp;#39;re good and ready so</text>
  <text start="421.979" dur="6.06">they can blame it on someone else now</text>
  <text start="425.01" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;re seeing signs that the US housing</text>
  <text start="428.039" dur="4.53">market is rolling over</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="4.44">now we mentioned this many times before</text>
  <text start="432.569" dur="4.5">I know the Fed is out there with their</text>
  <text start="435.21" dur="4.859">beige book telling us that housing is</text>
  <text start="437.069" dur="5.22">doing very well Larry Yun from a</text>
  <text start="440.069" dur="4.53">national association of realtors he is</text>
  <text start="442.289" dur="3.961">telling us that the real estate markets</text>
  <text start="444.599" dur="2.731">doing well actually he said that back in</text>
  <text start="446.25" dur="2.97">two thousand eight when everything was</text>
  <text start="447.33" dur="5.339">crashing and he said during the winter</text>
  <text start="449.22" dur="6.27">months of 2008 going to 2009 Real</text>
  <text start="452.669" dur="3.691">Estate&amp;#39;s going to bounce back so we know</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="4.34">that he doesn&amp;#39;t know what he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="456.36" dur="7.77">about but there&amp;#39;s a new report out there</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="8.13">that shows a new threat that&amp;#39;s emerging</text>
  <text start="464.13" dur="6.779">in the US housing market house flipping</text>
  <text start="467.96" dur="5.139">by third-party investors that auction is</text>
  <text start="470.909" dur="4.82">back with a vengeance now this is</text>
  <text start="473.099" dur="5.341">according to realtytrac the share of</text>
  <text start="475.729" dur="5.291">foreclosures snapped up by third-party</text>
  <text start="478.44" dur="5.279">investors at auctions just hit a record</text>
  <text start="481.02" dur="10.649">thirty-one percent in June this is a</text>
  <text start="483.719" dur="11.161">redo of the housing bubble in 2008 now</text>
  <text start="491.669" dur="6.451">we&amp;#39;re also seeing that third party</text>
  <text start="494.88" dur="6.87">buyers are inexperienced they&amp;#39;re mostly</text>
  <text start="498.12" dur="9">mom and pop and the institutional</text>
  <text start="501.75" dur="9">investors they&amp;#39;re dumping their flips</text>
  <text start="507.12" dur="10.02">and third party buyers are taking over</text>
  <text start="510.75" dur="9.419">and again we&amp;#39;ve seen this before and why</text>
  <text start="517.14" dur="5.069">is this very important because the same</text>
  <text start="520.169" dur="5.251">kind of decline in institutional buyers</text>
  <text start="522.209" dur="6.75">was a dramatic harbinger of the last</text>
  <text start="525.42" dur="8.1">downturn as more seasoned stakeholders</text>
  <text start="528.959" dur="8.151">headed for the sidelines so what else</text>
  <text start="533.52" dur="6.48">are we seeing in the housing market well</text>
  <text start="537.11" dur="6.46">we&amp;#39;re seeing something very similar that</text>
  <text start="540" dur="8.67">happened in 2007-2008 spending on</text>
  <text start="543.57" dur="8.4">furniture and home goods guess what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.67" dur="5.12">declining the latest from bank of</text>
  <text start="551.97" dur="5.09">america credit and debit card data</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="8.159">spending at home good stores has been</text>
  <text start="557.06" dur="6.079">slowing since the middle of last year</text>
  <text start="561.949" dur="4.67">the</text>
  <text start="563.139" dur="6.54">recent data shows that this is</text>
  <text start="566.619" dur="5.041">increasing in the downward trend this is</text>
  <text start="569.679" dur="7.02">reaching the lowest since the recession</text>
  <text start="571.66" dur="8.88">period so in reality we are back to</text>
  <text start="576.699" dur="6.42">where we were in 2007-2008 and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="580.54" dur="4.289">seeing the same exact signs now</text>
  <text start="583.119" dur="6.21">something very interesting and I</text>
  <text start="584.829" dur="9.3">mentioned this before that credit Swiss</text>
  <text start="589.329" dur="9.99">is reporting that traffic is declining</text>
  <text start="594.129" dur="9.21">in the housing market traffic has</text>
  <text start="599.319" dur="6.96">faltered in June buyer traffic index</text>
  <text start="603.339" dur="6.951">took a sizeable step back in June</text>
  <text start="606.279" dur="8.191">slipping 241 from 52 in May indicating</text>
  <text start="610.29" dur="8.019">traffic levels are below agents</text>
  <text start="614.47" dur="6.719">expectations more agents right now are</text>
  <text start="618.309" dur="6.18">citing buyers concerns with the broader</text>
  <text start="621.189" dur="5.161">economy and the volatile financial</text>
  <text start="624.489" dur="5.22">markets they&amp;#39;re holding back on</text>
  <text start="626.35" dur="7.739">purchases so what they&amp;#39;re really saying</text>
  <text start="629.709" dur="8.25">is that traffic is drying up the economy</text>
  <text start="634.089" dur="10.131">is getting worse and people are nervous</text>
  <text start="637.959" dur="8.55">right now so most markets in June</text>
  <text start="644.22" dur="6.099">they&amp;#39;re showing that traffic is</text>
  <text start="646.509" dur="8.57">declining eight of the 40 markets that</text>
  <text start="650.319" dur="9.091">they looked at only show that traffic is</text>
  <text start="655.079" dur="7.63">still moving up the other 32 markets</text>
  <text start="659.41" dur="7.399">they&amp;#39;re coming down what does this tell</text>
  <text start="662.709" dur="7.28">you this tells you we have the same</text>
  <text start="666.809" dur="5.38">situation that we saw once before and</text>
  <text start="669.989" dur="6.04">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on</text>
  <text start="672.189" dur="5.85">is now coming true don&amp;#39;t worry the US</text>
  <text start="676.029" dur="2.97">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="678.039" dur="3.54">going to make it look like the real</text>
  <text start="678.999" dur="5.851">estate markets doing very well but many</text>
  <text start="681.579" dur="4.95">people are writing in saying yes I my</text>
  <text start="684.85" dur="4.909">house has been up for sale for seven</text>
  <text start="686.529" dur="5.25">months now I and getting nothing</text>
  <text start="689.759" dur="3.19">actually many people saying that just</text>
  <text start="691.779" dur="4.381">going to take their house off the market</text>
  <text start="692.949" dur="8.37">right at this point</text>
  <text start="696.16" dur="9.869">now we&amp;#39;re seeing that the central</text>
  <text start="701.319" dur="8.82">bankers they kind of admitted that this</text>
  <text start="706.029" dur="6.891">whole recovery is fake remember what</text>
  <text start="710.139" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;ve done the Fed kept rates at zero</text>
  <text start="712.92" dur="7.95">percent for seven years the Fed spent</text>
  <text start="716.079" dur="7.74">over three trillion in QA the Fed raised</text>
  <text start="720.87" dur="5.589">interest rates just once in the last ten</text>
  <text start="723.819" dur="7.171">years the Fed is now talking about</text>
  <text start="726.459" dur="7.68">implementing helicopter money actually</text>
  <text start="730.99" dur="5.099">when you look at this this proves that</text>
  <text start="734.139" dur="7.2">the Fed knows the economy is not growing</text>
  <text start="736.089" dur="6.36">and the recovery is false why else would</text>
  <text start="741.339" dur="3.35">the Fed be calling the most</text>
  <text start="742.449" dur="5.401">extraordinary monetary policy in history</text>
  <text start="744.689" dur="5.161">because the recovery is so great and the</text>
  <text start="747.85" dur="6.83">fret isn&amp;#39;t worried about anything no</text>
  <text start="749.85" dur="8.429">helicopter money is the nuclear option</text>
  <text start="754.68" dur="6.31">the economy is in trouble they know it</text>
  <text start="758.279" dur="4.42">they understand that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="760.99" dur="4.74">telling a lie all this time because if</text>
  <text start="762.699" dur="5.7">the economy is truly recovering they can</text>
  <text start="765.73" dur="5.52">just let the interest rates rise they</text>
  <text start="768.399" dur="5.461">don&amp;#39;t have to pass the baton to each</text>
  <text start="771.25" dur="8.22">central bank and have them create money</text>
  <text start="773.86" dur="9.39">out of thin air which is QE they would</text>
  <text start="779.47" dur="5.849">just let it go because it&amp;#39;s fine they</text>
  <text start="783.25" dur="4.199">wouldn&amp;#39;t have to manipulate the stock</text>
  <text start="785.319" dur="7.38">market with Bank of Japan and easy be</text>
  <text start="787.449" dur="7.051">pumping in tons of currency they know</text>
  <text start="792.699" dur="6.87">the only thing propping the market</text>
  <text start="794.5" dur="10.35">higher is their manipulation so what</text>
  <text start="799.569" dur="10.14">they&amp;#39;re telling us is that yeah this</text>
  <text start="804.85" dur="8.06">economy it&amp;#39;s collapsing and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="809.709" dur="7.281">know what else to do except continually</text>
  <text start="812.91" dur="7.69">manipulate everything to keep it alive</text>
  <text start="816.99" dur="6.94">now of course as we know they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="820.6" dur="6.419">to be blamed for any of this and we also</text>
  <text start="823.93" dur="5.25">know that they&amp;#39;re planning something</text>
