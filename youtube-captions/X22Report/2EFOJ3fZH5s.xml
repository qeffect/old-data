  <text start="53.579" dur="5.28">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the X</text>
  <text start="57.179" dur="4.65">we need to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="58.859" dur="5.851">this is episode 1391 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="61.829" dur="5.101">is October 2nd 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="64.71" dur="4.26">the episode is the IMF says the</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="4.979">blockchain could displace the fractional</text>
  <text start="68.97" dur="5.189">banking model let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="3.901">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="74.159" dur="2.941">today we see the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="75.81" dur="2.61">out there and of course the government</text>
  <text start="77.1" dur="4.199">is out there telling us how great</text>
  <text start="78.42" dur="4.79">manufacturing is and what we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="81.299" dur="5.671">at right now and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="83.21" dur="6.49">every time there&amp;#39;s some type of major</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="7.02">disaster like a hurricane like Katrina</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="7.169">the 2010 super storms Harvey all of a</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="4.26">sudden we see an uptick in manufacturing</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="2.79">where they&amp;#39;re producing a lot of wood</text>
  <text start="98.25" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re producing a lot of goods and</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re bringing it into the areas but</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="6.839">what happens right after these major</text>
  <text start="105.179" dur="7.62">storms the entire manufacturing world</text>
  <text start="108.869" dur="6.511">completely collapses and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="112.799" dur="4.35">before this is nothing new but the</text>
  <text start="115.38" dur="3.03">corporate media is out there playing it</text>
  <text start="117.149" dur="4.23">up that everything is great</text>
  <text start="118.41" dur="5.069">manufacturing is growing and this is</text>
  <text start="121.379" dur="4.291">just a one-off thing like we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="4.26">before nothing new they&amp;#39;re also really</text>
  <text start="125.67" dur="4.83">making a big deal about construction</text>
  <text start="127.739" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re out there telling us that US</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="4.62">construction spending is much higher</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="8.239">right now but they forgot to tell you</text>
  <text start="135.12" dur="8.369">about the huge revision of the July</text>
  <text start="140.629" dur="7.991">construction spending and it was revised</text>
  <text start="143.489" dur="9.541">down by 1.2 percent now even though we</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="6.3">had this modest uptick 2017 remains the</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="7.23">worst year for construction spending</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="8.489">growth since 2010 so this fits into what</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="5.28">is happening in housing right now and it</text>
  <text start="163.409" dur="4.231">looks like this is really not a recovery</text>
  <text start="165.54" dur="3.54">this is just a way to manipulate and</text>
  <text start="167.64" dur="3.569">spin the numbers to make it look a lot</text>
  <text start="169.08" dur="4.68">better than it really is and here we are</text>
  <text start="171.209" dur="4.801">in the month of October and we</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="4.47">understand them we realize that things</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="3.57">seemed to happen not in October and when</text>
  <text start="178.23" dur="4.91">I&amp;#39;m talking what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="179.58" dur="6.21">is the stock market now</text>
  <text start="183.14" dur="4.24">October 19th will mark the 30th</text>
  <text start="185.79" dur="3.99">anniversary of Wall Street</text>
  <text start="187.38" dur="6.51">of 1987 where the Dow Industrials fell</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="7.41">around 22% in a single day which would</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="5.94">be a 4900 point drop if it happened</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="8.22">today in fact stocks crash in October in</text>
  <text start="199.83" dur="9.69">1907 1929 2008 now the question is will</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="7.44">the market come down this October well</text>
  <text start="209.52" dur="4.77">right now we know that the entire stock</text>
  <text start="212.85" dur="2.79">market&amp;#39;s been manipulated</text>
  <text start="214.29" dur="3.15">we know the central banks around the</text>
  <text start="215.64" dur="4.08">world have been buying stocks we know</text>
  <text start="217.44" dur="7.59">that US stock valuations are currently</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="8.43">at very high standards compared to what</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="6.42">they were like in the past bonds are</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="5.19">also very expensive the bond markets are</text>
  <text start="231.45" dur="5.1">also trading at lofty levels right now</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="5.25">and we know that many countries right</text>
  <text start="236.55" dur="4.23">now their benchmark interest rates are</text>
  <text start="238.59" dur="4.32">close to zero or even in the negative</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="3.63">area and we understand the Federal</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="3.51">Reserve and keeping the interest rates</text>
  <text start="244.41" dur="5.82">very very low now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="8.07">interesting is that we haven&amp;#39;t seen the</text>
  <text start="250.23" dur="10.25">federal funds rate above 6% since 2008</text>
  <text start="254.49" dur="8.46">and it hasn&amp;#39;t been at 10% since 1989 and</text>
  <text start="260.48" dur="5.44">there are many people out there that are</text>
  <text start="262.95" dur="6.24">calling for a correction in the market</text>
  <text start="265.92" dur="6.12">and I believe this will come when the</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="5.01">real economy detaches itself from the</text>
  <text start="272.04" dur="4.08">manipulated numbers we are seeing this</text>
  <text start="274.2" dur="3.93">happen right now right in front of our</text>
  <text start="276.12" dur="3.39">faces where we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="2.85">manipulated numbers we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="279.51" dur="3.69">manipulated unemployment manipulated</text>
  <text start="280.98" dur="3.3">stock market manipulated corporate</text>
  <text start="283.2" dur="3.75">earnings we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="4.92">manipulated data that the US government</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="3.9">the Fed puts out there and when we take</text>
  <text start="289.2" dur="4.98">a look at what&amp;#39;s really happening in the</text>
  <text start="290.85" dur="5.7">economy like retail consumer spending</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="5.07">the actual tax receipts that are coming</text>
  <text start="296.55" dur="5.43">into the US federal government these are</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="4.23">all declining revenues of corporations</text>
  <text start="301.98" dur="5.19">are declining and this is what we mean</text>
  <text start="303.48" dur="5.16">by the real economy the real information</text>
  <text start="307.17" dur="3.06">not the manipulated numbers where they</text>
  <text start="308.64" dur="2.88">can continually go back in time and say</text>
  <text start="310.23" dur="3.78">hey you know what we&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="311.52" dur="4.62">change our methodology and make this</text>
  <text start="314.01" dur="4.8">completely different now we understand</text>
  <text start="316.14" dur="5.08">why all this is happening the more the</text>
  <text start="318.81" dur="5.11">entire economy is deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="321.22" dur="4.08">very quickly they realize to keep the</text>
  <text start="323.92" dur="3.63">illusion alive they have to continually</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="4.14">manipulate the numbers they need to pump</text>
  <text start="327.55" dur="5.28">up the stock market they meet they need</text>
  <text start="329.44" dur="5.73">to make this seem like it&amp;#39;s the best</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s ever been because if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="335.17" dur="4.68">everything will be blamed on them now we</text>
  <text start="336.85" dur="6.06">understand that the central bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="339.85" dur="6.06">are positioning themselves to make some</text>
  <text start="342.91" dur="5.31">type of transition and what I mean what</text>
  <text start="345.91" dur="4.04">do I mean by this well they realize and</text>
  <text start="348.22" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;ve known this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="349.95" dur="5.41">the dollar is dying they know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.56" dur="4.98">just too much debt out there the global</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="4.7">debt level is unsustainable right now we</text>
  <text start="358.54" dur="3.15">have something called the blockchain</text>
  <text start="360.06" dur="4.99">technology we know that there are</text>
  <text start="361.69" dur="5.88">certain banking systems that are working</text>
  <text start="365.05" dur="5.61">on this the central banks are included</text>
  <text start="367.57" dur="4.92">in this and we know that they want to</text>
  <text start="370.66" dur="3.84">take control of it now we understand</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="3.63">that a lot of the cryptocurrencies right</text>
  <text start="374.5" dur="4.2">now are very volatile they move up and</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="5.61">down and I believe what the central</text>
  <text start="378.7" dur="4.53">banks are getting prepared to do is they</text>
  <text start="381.73" dur="3.36">are getting prepared to say listen we</text>
  <text start="383.23" dur="3.39">can stop this volatility we can keep</text>
  <text start="385.09" dur="3.32">everything at a level playing field so</text>
  <text start="386.62" dur="4.2">you can feel rest assured that</text>
  <text start="388.41" dur="5.77">cryptocurrency the blockchain technology</text>
  <text start="390.82" dur="6.12">will work for you now we understand that</text>
  <text start="394.18" dur="5.37">they are trying to do away with cash now</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="4.74">either they use their electronic bank</text>
  <text start="399.55" dur="5.22">banking system the fractional banking</text>
  <text start="401.68" dur="5.16">system or they move the entire world</text>
  <text start="404.77" dur="5.459">into the blockchain technology now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.84" dur="5.73">not going to be this free open crypto</text>
  <text start="410.229" dur="6.451">currency where nobody has control over</text>
  <text start="412.57" dur="5.67">it they still want control now the</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="4.95">managing director of the International</text>
  <text start="418.24" dur="5.45">Monetary Fund has speculated that</text>
  <text start="421.63" dur="7.14">bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="423.69" dur="8.77">well there might be a future within the</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="5.459">central banking system now Christine</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="3.68">Lagarde is saying it could display</text>
  <text start="434.229" dur="4.981">central bank&amp;#39;s conventional banking and</text>
  <text start="436.14" dur="6.46">challenge of the monopoly of national</text>
  <text start="439.21" dur="5.51">monies in the long run the technology</text>
  <text start="442.6" dur="7.71">itself can replace national monies and</text>
  <text start="444.72" dur="9.74">the fractional banking system now what</text>
  <text start="450.31" dur="8.79">she is saying is that the central banks</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="8.459">they want to control the blockchain</text>
  <text start="459.1" dur="9.4">technology they want full control of it</text>
  <text start="462.919" dur="8.071">and at this point they will not need the</text>
  <text start="468.5" dur="6.02">banking system they can actually do away</text>
  <text start="470.99" dur="7.64">with it because everyone will be online</text>
  <text start="474.52" dur="6.31">it will be completely virtual and as</text>
  <text start="478.63" dur="5.05">just like Bitcoin right today there is a</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="7.07">cap of how much can be created their</text>
  <text start="483.68" dur="7.29">digital currency will have no cap and</text>
  <text start="487.9" dur="5.17">this will be done on purpose because</text>
  <text start="490.97" dur="3.24">they won&amp;#39;t want to create as much as</text>
  <text start="493.07" dur="2.219">they possibly can now in the beginning</text>
  <text start="494.21" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re going to come out and say yes</text>
  <text start="495.289" dur="6.201">there is a cap there you can only create</text>
  <text start="498.56" dur="6.81">this much but there will be a function</text>
  <text start="501.49" dur="5.62">to remove this cap and allow them to</text>
  <text start="505.37" dur="3.919">create as much as they want because</text>
  <text start="507.11" dur="5.7">remember the central banking system</text>
  <text start="509.289" dur="5.651">their main objective is to put all</text>
  <text start="512.81" dur="4.5">countries into debt so they can control</text>
  <text start="514.94" dur="4.649">these countries and she was out there</text>
  <text start="517.31" dur="4.169">saying that and citizens may one day</text>
  <text start="519.589" dur="3.421">prefer virtual currencies since they</text>
  <text start="521.479" dur="4.321">potentially offered the same cost and</text>
  <text start="523.01" dur="5.43">convenience as cash no settlement risks</text>
  <text start="525.8" dur="5.25">no clearing delays no central</text>
  <text start="528.44" dur="5.22">registration no intermediary to check</text>
  <text start="531.05" dur="5.039">accounts and identities if privately</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="5.489">issued virtual currencies remain risky</text>
  <text start="536.089" dur="5.94">and unstable citizens may even call on</text>
  <text start="539.149" dur="6.391">central banks to provide digital forms</text>
  <text start="542.029" dur="8.671">of legal tender that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="545.54" dur="7.109">right there now right now as we can see</text>
  <text start="550.7" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s a lot of cryptocurrencies out</text>
  <text start="552.649" dur="4.621">there and bitcoin is it seems to be the</text>
  <text start="555.62" dur="3.6">leader right now and it&amp;#39;s very volatile</text>
  <text start="557.27" dur="4.98">it goes up and down and it looks like</text>
  <text start="559.22" dur="4.38">the central banks might move into this</text>
  <text start="562.25" dur="3.779">area and it looks like they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="6.359">planning on this for quite a while where</text>
  <text start="566.029" dur="6.18">they might say we can help this is how</text>
  <text start="569.959" dur="4.38">the central bankers work they always</text>
  <text start="572.209" dur="5.101">come out and tell you how they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="574.339" dur="4.981">to make it better for you even though</text>
  <text start="577.31" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re going to make it better for them</text>
  <text start="579.32" dur="5.3">and what they&amp;#39;re going to try to do is</text>
  <text start="581.63" dur="6.2">they&amp;#39;re going to try to introduce a</text>
  <text start="584.62" dur="6.81">cryptocurrency that will</text>
  <text start="587.83" dur="6.12">be volatile that they will control and</text>
  <text start="591.43" dur="5.07">it looks like this is where we are</text>
  <text start="593.95" dur="6.42">moving right now it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="596.5" dur="6.48">what their plan is all along so at this</text>
  <text start="600.37" dur="6.21">point they understand that the old</text>
  <text start="602.98" dur="7.23">method of these currencies these paper</text>
  <text start="606.58" dur="7.59">dollars the fractional reserve banking</text>
  <text start="610.21" dur="6.36">well it can be easily done by just</text>
  <text start="614.17" dur="5.16">controlling the computer systems you</text>
  <text start="616.57" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t need all these banking system you</text>
  <text start="619.33" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t need all of this they&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="620.71" dur="4.35">control all the different systems around</text>
  <text start="622.72" dur="5.94">the world and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="625.06" dur="6.63">exactly where they&amp;#39;re trying to move the</text>
  <text start="628.66" dur="4.86">people into and they&amp;#39;re gonna make it</text>
  <text start="631.69" dur="4.92">look like it&amp;#39;s really really great for</text>
  <text start="633.52" dur="6.81">the people now to get there first</text>
  <text start="636.61" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re going to have to explain why the</text>
  <text start="640.33" dur="4.56">old system is no good now they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="642.64" dur="3.36">just going to say hey by the way you</text>
  <text start="644.89" dur="3.63">know the system we&amp;#39;re using right now</text>
  <text start="646" dur="3.72">the dollar all these banking system all</text>
  <text start="648.52" dur="3.63">the branches and everything like that</text>
  <text start="649.72" dur="4.11">well there&amp;#39;s just no good and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="652.15" dur="4.86">just no good we don&amp;#39;t need them anymore</text>
  <text start="653.83" dur="6.69">no they&amp;#39;re gonna make it look like they</text>
  <text start="657.01" dur="4.38">are susceptible to cyber attacks because</text>
  <text start="660.52" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s centralized</text>
  <text start="661.39" dur="7.8">they&amp;#39;re gonna make it look like that the</text>
  <text start="665.41" dur="8.96">system was destroyed by maybe some type</text>
  <text start="669.19" dur="7.95">of event by another country or group and</text>
  <text start="674.37" dur="5.35">they are pushing this agenda very very</text>
  <text start="677.14" dur="4.14">hard and this is why everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="679.72" dur="3.84">be prepared now gold and silver will</text>
  <text start="681.28" dur="5.94">still play a role in this remember this</text>
  <text start="683.56" dur="6.63">is a store of wealth you&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="687.22" dur="6.72">transfer anything into digital currency</text>
  <text start="690.19" dur="5.55">now hopefully the people rise up and</text>
  <text start="693.94" dur="3.45">tell the central bankers no we are not</text>
  <text start="695.74" dur="4.47">headed in this direction when the time</text>
  <text start="697.39" dur="5.58">comes but at this point we&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="700.21" dur="5.7">crossroads right now the old system is</text>
  <text start="702.97" dur="5.61">dying and the new system is being born</text>
  <text start="705.91" dur="4.92">now right now China and Russia they have</text>
  <text start="708.58" dur="4.2">been setting everything up to handle the</text>
  <text start="710.83" dur="4.11">new system and I think eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="712.78" dur="4.65">going to happen is everything will move</text>
  <text start="714.94" dur="4.16">from the west to the east but eventually</text>
  <text start="717.43" dur="3.949">it will then be turned into</text>
  <text start="719.1" dur="7.259">cryptocurrency where</text>
  <text start="721.379" dur="7.5">as hands-off and everything goes to the</text>
  <text start="726.359" dur="4.89">central banking system now China will</text>
  <text start="728.879" dur="5.91">handle you know the manufacturing China</text>
  <text start="731.249" dur="5.55">will handle the exchanges they will</text>
  <text start="734.789" dur="3.78">handle all of this the United States</text>
  <text start="736.799" dur="4.38">will be left out of this I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="738.569" dur="5.79">handling trade they&amp;#39;ll be handling the</text>
  <text start="741.179" dur="5.52">belton road they&amp;#39;ll be handling this</text>
  <text start="744.359" dur="4.38">whole entire system and this is what</text>
  <text start="746.699" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ve been building on for a very long</text>
  <text start="748.739" dur="6.33">time in the meantime the central banks</text>
  <text start="751.379" dur="7.28">in the background will be handling the</text>
  <text start="755.069" dur="5.28">currency they will be handling the</text>
  <text start="758.659" dur="4.12">intermediate currency</text>
  <text start="760.349" dur="5.13">maybe the STRs and then moving everyone</text>
  <text start="762.779" dur="4.41">into the crypto market remember the</text>
  <text start="765.479" dur="4.35">crypto market is very very small right</text>
  <text start="767.189" dur="4.08">now as it grows and it gets bigger and</text>
  <text start="769.829" dur="3.45">bigger or bigger just like the Internet</text>
  <text start="771.269" dur="4.951">we&amp;#39;re going to see many different things</text>
  <text start="773.279" dur="4.71">change and we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="776.22" dur="3.419">getting prepared and ready for this but</text>
  <text start="777.989" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to do this in stages</text>
  <text start="779.639" dur="3.3">this is not going to happen at once this</text>
  <text start="781.319" dur="3.901">is their plan I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="782.939" dur="4.2">to happen this way they would like it to</text>
  <text start="785.22" dur="3.779">happen this way unless the people get</text>
  <text start="787.139" dur="3.75">involved but everyone needs to be</text>
  <text start="788.999" dur="3.48">prepared and ready remember asset is</text>
  <text start="790.889" dur="2.28">still an asset it&amp;#39;s still going to be</text>
  <text start="792.479" dur="3.48">worth something</text>
  <text start="793.169" dur="4.65">gold silver land things like that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="795.959" dur="4.8">still going to be worth something in the</text>
  <text start="797.819" dur="6.95">end all we&amp;#39;re talking about is a way to</text>
  <text start="800.759" dur="6.27">trade using a digital currency and</text>
  <text start="804.769" dur="4">actually not using the dollar anymore</text>
  <text start="807.029" dur="4.441">using something completely different</text>
  <text start="808.769" dur="4.44">which means whatever we&amp;#39;re using is</text>
  <text start="811.47" dur="3.659">going to be devalued because will no</text>
  <text start="813.209" dur="4.38">longer be the reserve currency and this</text>
  <text start="815.129" dur="5.01">is why you need to maintain your wealth</text>
  <text start="817.589" dur="4.83">and this is why you need gold silver</text>
  <text start="820.139" dur="3.93">land maybe even stocks with dividends</text>
  <text start="822.419" dur="3.54">and things like that now they might</text>
  <text start="824.069" dur="4.531">socks might go down in value when the</text>
  <text start="825.959" dur="4.41">market goes down but you still have</text>
  <text start="828.6" dur="4.889">something I wouldn&amp;#39;t put everything in</text>
  <text start="830.369" dur="5.4">that basket but you can see that we are</text>
  <text start="833.489" dur="5.16">definitely in going to be in this</text>
  <text start="835.769" dur="4.44">transition period where everyone needs</text>
  <text start="838.649" dur="3.69">to be ready and prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="840.209" dur="4.14">coming and we can see the central</text>
  <text start="842.339" dur="5.1">bankers are getting ready China and</text>
  <text start="844.349" dur="4.17">Russia are getting ready well most of</text>
  <text start="847.439" dur="2.911">the people here in the United States</text>
  <text start="848.519" dur="3.99">they are not getting ready they&amp;#39;re kept</text>
  <text start="850.35" dur="3.389">in the dark actually people around the</text>
  <text start="852.509" dur="2.791">world are kept in the dark there are a</text>
  <text start="853.739" dur="3.331">few out there that are listening</text>
  <text start="855.3" dur="3.15">and paying attention and seeing what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="857.07" dur="2.85">going on just like there are many people</text>
  <text start="858.45" dur="3.81">didn&amp;#39;t realize the internet was being</text>
  <text start="859.92" dur="3.81">born they didn&amp;#39;t know what it was they</text>
  <text start="862.26" dur="3.66">didn&amp;#39;t know how it worked they do</text>
  <text start="863.73" dur="4.05">nothing about it until AOL came along</text>
  <text start="865.92" dur="3.96">and they still didn&amp;#39;t know much about it</text>
  <text start="867.78" dur="4.16">they didn&amp;#39;t know Matt you know</text>
  <text start="869.88" dur="5.07">everything was gonna be going online and</text>
  <text start="871.94" dur="5.07">all of a sudden we got off at AOL</text>
  <text start="874.95" dur="4.71">everyone had direct connection and</text>
  <text start="877.01" dur="4.87">everyone uses today on a little device</text>
  <text start="879.66" dur="3.15">called your smart phone well the same</text>
  <text start="881.88" dur="4.53">thing is going to be happening with</text>
  <text start="882.81" dur="4.86">cryptocurrency everyone&amp;#39;s not gonna no</text>
  <text start="886.41" dur="2.88">one understands it right now and</text>
  <text start="887.67" dur="3.15">everyone hears about it but doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="889.29" dur="4.65">really pay attention to it and</text>
  <text start="890.82" dur="5.3">eventually what happens is time goes on</text>
  <text start="893.94" dur="5.07">and the technology gets more robust</text>
  <text start="896.12" dur="4.21">people start to use it people tell you</text>
  <text start="899.01" dur="3.51">that this is what we&amp;#39;re switching to and</text>
  <text start="900.33" dur="4.68">before you know it everyone is using it</text>
  <text start="902.52" dur="4.92">this is what the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="905.01" dur="4.98">planning on now cryptocurrency is not a</text>
  <text start="907.44" dur="4.56">bad thing as long as the people control</text>
  <text start="909.99" dur="4.38">it and that&amp;#39;s what we need to make sure</text>
  <text start="912" dur="4.59">of is that the people around the world</text>
  <text start="914.37" dur="6.21">are in control of creating their own</text>
  <text start="916.59" dur="8.04">currency not an organization where they</text>
  <text start="920.58" dur="5.67">can control what is going on and this is</text>
  <text start="924.63" dur="2.97">why you need to be ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="926.25" dur="3.39">because we&amp;#39;re going to be going through</text>
  <text start="927.6" dur="4.77">this transition and it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
