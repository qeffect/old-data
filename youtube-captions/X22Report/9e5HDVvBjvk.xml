  <text start="64.44" dur="4.05">the title of the episode is we are now</text>
  <text start="66.54" dur="5.19">at the tipping point the economic</text>
  <text start="68.49" dur="5.01">contraction picks up speed let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.73" dur="4.23">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.5" dur="4.47">news now what we are seeing we are</text>
  <text start="75.96" dur="5.91">seeing the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="77.97" dur="6.42">they are losing the narrative and you</text>
  <text start="81.87" dur="6.06">can see from the testimony with Comey</text>
  <text start="84.39" dur="5.88">things are starting to go south and what</text>
  <text start="87.93" dur="4.5">is happening right now we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="4.53">see the economy contract even more I</text>
  <text start="92.43" dur="4.89">mean this is really speeding up at this</text>
  <text start="94.8" dur="4.71">point and we can see out in the UK</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="5.7">retail sales are down we can see the</text>
  <text start="99.51" dur="6.3">housing bubble in Canada with also home</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="4.89">Capital Group where deposits have been</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="5.1">leaving that financial institution we</text>
  <text start="107.91" dur="4.8">see Banco Popular they did a bail in</text>
  <text start="110.91" dur="4.8">there we know there&amp;#39;s a lot of other</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="4.29">banks that are in trouble and we know</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="4.92">that these stress tests that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="117" dur="6.06">been using they are completely fake</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="6">phony and false this was to convince us</text>
  <text start="123.06" dur="5.28">that everything was great listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="3.21">doing these stress tests and everything</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="3.84">is fine I mean think about what they did</text>
  <text start="129.84" dur="6.3">after the 30s they went back and they</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="5.91">said okay listen we&amp;#39;ll add insurance on</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="3.42">to this will guarantee your deposits</text>
  <text start="138.09" dur="3.35">within the banks and this is this is</text>
  <text start="139.56" dur="6.39">what brought trust back to the banks</text>
  <text start="141.44" dur="7.45">2008 they raised the limit of the FDIC</text>
  <text start="145.95" dur="5.19">guarantee to gain the trust and they</text>
  <text start="148.89" dur="4.92">also said we will then stress test now</text>
  <text start="151.14" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re coming up to the point where the</text>
  <text start="153.81" dur="3.87">banks at this point they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="155.97" dur="3.78">insolvent and everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="5.76">been trying to do to convince us that</text>
  <text start="159.75" dur="5.34">their system is strong well it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="4.74">starting to fall apart right in front of</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="5.19">our eyes and I think the next time as we</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="4.98">move forward they&amp;#39;re going to run out of</text>
  <text start="170.28" dur="5.25">guarantees and this is when the big one</text>
  <text start="173.16" dur="3.81">hits now when we look around the world</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="3.209">we can see that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="176.97" dur="3.48">deteriorating very very quickly in</text>
  <text start="178.739" dur="4.231">Mexico we see their industrial</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="4.409">production that is crashed by four point</text>
  <text start="182.97" dur="4.23">four percent enable this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="184.859" dur="5.24">drop since October 2009</text>
  <text start="187.2" dur="6.149">and manufacturing well that dropped by</text>
  <text start="190.099" dur="5.441">1.7 percent now this is the third month</text>
  <text start="193.349" dur="3.631">a month drop in a row and it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="5.61">biggest month-on-month drop since</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="7.55">November of 2015 now this is somewhat</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="6.419">unprecedented and a sudden downshift of</text>
  <text start="204.53" dur="6.34">industrial production and manufacturing</text>
  <text start="207.569" dur="6.721">in Mexico and if we look here in the</text>
  <text start="210.87" dur="4.5">United States we see that retailers they</text>
  <text start="214.29" dur="3.12">are in trouble</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="3.54">and we can see the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="217.41" dur="3.51">picking up on this now like I said</text>
  <text start="218.91" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re going to start to come out with</text>
  <text start="220.92" dur="4.77">stories telling you how bad the economy</text>
  <text start="223.05" dur="5.64">is doing this is coming out of Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="5.22">now where they&amp;#39;re saying that moles if</text>
  <text start="228.69" dur="5.43">they didn&amp;#39;t have enough problems before</text>
  <text start="230.91" dur="6.45">they have one additional problem because</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="5.46">what is happening is retailers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.36" dur="4.95">looking to slash the duration of their</text>
  <text start="239.58" dur="4.56">leases in strip malls and moles</text>
  <text start="242.31" dur="3.929">now we know there&amp;#39;s been a lot of</text>
  <text start="244.14" dur="3.72">bankruptcies and there&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="246.239" dur="4.431">coming we know thousands of stores have</text>
  <text start="247.86" dur="5.31">closed actually Garak Browne vice</text>
  <text start="250.67" dur="4.53">president of American retail research</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="5.909">he&amp;#39;s saying there&amp;#39;s going to be between</text>
  <text start="255.2" dur="8.29">9,000 and 10,000 stores that will close</text>
  <text start="259.079" dur="7.531">in this year this is far above what UBS</text>
  <text start="263.49" dur="6.72">has predicted now to take this one step</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="5.49">further Cushman and Wakefield they from</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="5.64">their figures they&amp;#39;re predicting that</text>
  <text start="272.1" dur="7.5">next year there&amp;#39;s going to be 13,000</text>
  <text start="275.85" dur="6.02">store closures now to further complicate</text>
  <text start="279.6" dur="5.04">this before</text>
  <text start="281.87" dur="5.59">retailers used to lease spaces between</text>
  <text start="284.64" dur="4.83">five and ten years now they want to</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="5.67">lease space between one and two years</text>
  <text start="289.47" dur="6.12">and again because the reason they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="4.26">doing this is because they realize that</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="5.19">they don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re going to make</text>
  <text start="297.39" dur="6.12">it which means their books must must</text>
  <text start="300.78" dur="4.889">look really really bad if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="303.51" dur="6.27">looking to only take out a one to two</text>
  <text start="305.669" dur="6.901">year lease now we can see that according</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="8.58">to Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="312.57" dur="8.19">be about 300 to 1150 US malls that will</text>
  <text start="318.36" dur="6.06">be shutting down in the next</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="5.22">five years and we can see that I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="324.42" dur="4.68">to say there&amp;#39;s going to be probably</text>
  <text start="325.98" dur="5.61">double this because at the rate we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.1" dur="5.55">going right now and what we see coming</text>
  <text start="331.59" dur="4.65">up there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of most</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="4.02">closing because think about it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="336.24" dur="4.65">taking these little shorter lease terms</text>
  <text start="338.67" dur="3.93">it means that they can get out of these</text>
  <text start="340.89" dur="4.56">leases they don&amp;#39;t have to pay that much</text>
  <text start="342.6" dur="4.44">and it shows us that they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="345.45" dur="3.66">worried about their bottom line which</text>
  <text start="347.04" dur="5.01">means a lot of these stores are going to</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="5.1">completely go under and we know why this</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="4.58">is happening because a lot of</text>
  <text start="354.21" dur="6.26">individuals they don&amp;#39;t have jobs now</text>
  <text start="356.63" dur="7.21">yesterday we reported on how the</text>
  <text start="360.47" dur="6.22">individual person that consumers well</text>
  <text start="363.84" dur="4.71">they haven&amp;#39;t been buying autos they</text>
  <text start="366.69" dur="4.14">haven&amp;#39;t been taking out student loans</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="4.23">lately they have been using their credit</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="4.53">cards lately and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="372.78" dur="4.46">figure out why because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="375.36" dur="5.73">is that the latest data from the</text>
  <text start="377.24" dur="6.91">experience card default index is at</text>
  <text start="381.09" dur="5.04">March of 2017 the default rate on US</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="3.72">credit cards had jumped to three point</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="5.4">three one percent an increase of</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="6.72">thirteen percent from a year ago this is</text>
  <text start="391.53" dur="5.97">the highest default rate since 2013 now</text>
  <text start="394.59" dur="5.19">according to Moody&amp;#39;s the size of the</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="5.04">jump was surprising in light of the</text>
  <text start="399.78" dur="5.55">ongoing strength of the US employment</text>
  <text start="402.54" dur="4.29">market I mean is this laughable because</text>
  <text start="405.33" dur="3.78">we all know because we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="406.83" dur="5.1">it that these numbers are fake but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.11" dur="5.19">very strange how these rating agencies</text>
  <text start="411.93" dur="4.77">and all these economists are coming out</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="4.17">saying yeah we can&amp;#39;t explain this it</text>
  <text start="416.7" dur="4.92">makes no sense how could this be</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="6.78">everyone has a job everyone doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="421.62" dur="5.88">a job these numbers are completely fake</text>
  <text start="425.25" dur="6.75">the unemployment rate right now is</text>
  <text start="427.5" dur="6.39">around 23 percent the problem is that</text>
  <text start="432" dur="6.51">all those people who are unemployed it</text>
  <text start="433.89" dur="7.47">is hidden behind food stamps by having</text>
  <text start="438.51" dur="5.34">money being handed out to individuals by</text>
  <text start="441.36" dur="5.22">keeping everyone in the dark you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="443.85" dur="5.61">see the bread lines the soup lines like</text>
  <text start="446.58" dur="4.44">you did in the 30s so people don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="2.58">it they don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="451.02" dur="3.109">happening and they believe the</text>
  <text start="452.04" dur="3.379">statistical number and what</text>
  <text start="454.129" dur="3.54">seeing as a lot of people who had the</text>
  <text start="455.419" dur="4.59">full-time part-time jobs they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="5.49">one to three part-time jobs and a lot of</text>
  <text start="460.009" dur="6.571">people they&amp;#39;ve just given up or have</text>
  <text start="463.159" dur="5.671">they well according to the government</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="3.659">they&amp;#39;ve given up but they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="4.259">they&amp;#39;re still looking</text>
  <text start="470.239" dur="6.39">there&amp;#39;s just no jobs out there and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.089" dur="5.82">becoming very clear that the US consumer</text>
  <text start="476.629" dur="5.52">which is responsible for 70% of the US</text>
  <text start="478.909" dur="6.69">economic growth well the US consumer has</text>
  <text start="482.149" dur="7.83">finally rolled over and things aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="485.599" dur="7.59">going well now Boeing the US largest</text>
  <text start="489.979" dur="6.12">exporter by dollar value well it looks</text>
  <text start="493.189" dur="6.03">like their company&amp;#39;s not doing well in</text>
  <text start="496.099" dur="6.981">2016 net orders dropped by 13 percent</text>
  <text start="499.219" dur="6.36">from 2015 and 53 percent from 2014</text>
  <text start="503.08" dur="5.349">just six hundred and sixty-eight planes</text>
  <text start="505.579" dur="8.281">the lowest level since 2010 were ordered</text>
  <text start="508.429" dur="8.52">through June 6 2017 Boeing has just 208</text>
  <text start="513.86" dur="6.059">net orders the company right now is</text>
  <text start="516.949" dur="6.301">trying to cut costs they are laying off</text>
  <text start="519.919" dur="6.211">individuals its payroll has shriveled by</text>
  <text start="523.25" dur="5.639">around 30,000 workers over the past five</text>
  <text start="526.13" dur="4.8">years and it looks like they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="528.889" dur="5.64">be moving some of their work to China</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="6.269">and other locations overseas and we can</text>
  <text start="534.529" dur="5.641">see right now the economy is contracting</text>
  <text start="537.199" dur="5.791">it is reeling it is getting worse</text>
  <text start="540.17" dur="5.94">actually US companies that depend on</text>
  <text start="542.99" dur="6.12">consumers discretionary income they are</text>
  <text start="546.11" dur="5.219">at their weakest since Lehman Brothers</text>
  <text start="549.11" dur="5">and we know what happened during that</text>
  <text start="551.329" dur="6.301">period of time now when we look at</text>
  <text start="554.11" dur="6.339">different economic sectors we see things</text>
  <text start="557.63" dur="5.25">and there are signals here and there</text>
  <text start="560.449" dur="6.12">indicating to us that we are entering a</text>
  <text start="562.88" dur="6.329">recession now when we look at wholesale</text>
  <text start="566.569" dur="5.52">inventory we can see this is one of</text>
  <text start="569.209" dur="5.88">those signals and there was a big drop</text>
  <text start="572.089" dur="5.49">in automotive inventories and sales and</text>
  <text start="575.089" dur="4.951">foreign products april&amp;#39;s final host debt</text>
  <text start="577.579" dur="5.25">inventories data tumble by 0.5% month on</text>
  <text start="580.04" dur="5.64">month and it has not been a bigger drop</text>
  <text start="582.829" dur="3.871">since May of 2013 this is considerably</text>
  <text start="585.68" dur="3.69">worse</text>
  <text start="586.7" dur="4.44">then the preliminary print year on your</text>
  <text start="589.37" dur="4.2">growth in both wholesale inventories and</text>
  <text start="591.14" dur="6.36">sales well they are starting to roll</text>
  <text start="593.57" dur="7.05">over and all in all this signals that</text>
  <text start="597.5" dur="8.04">the second quarter GDP could be in for a</text>
  <text start="600.62" dur="7.47">big downside recalculation and we know</text>
  <text start="605.54" dur="5.46">that olanta Fed has the second quarter</text>
  <text start="608.09" dur="5.13">GDP at four percent the New York Fed now</text>
  <text start="611" dur="4.65">forecast is a little bit lower than that</text>
  <text start="613.22" dur="3.75">but we can see that these are completely</text>
  <text start="615.65" dur="3.68">fake numbers I mean look what is</text>
  <text start="616.97" dur="5.55">happening right now in the economy</text>
  <text start="619.33" dur="5.11">everything is contracting all at once</text>
  <text start="622.52" dur="5.55">all these numbers that are out there</text>
  <text start="624.44" dur="6.66">they are a complete illusion think back</text>
  <text start="628.07" dur="5.43">to 2008 when everyone said the subprime</text>
  <text start="631.1" dur="5.04">securities they were all triple-a rating</text>
  <text start="633.5" dur="6.06">they were all triple-a rated what</text>
  <text start="636.14" dur="8.25">happened that was a lie they were not</text>
  <text start="639.56" dur="7.95">truly triple-a rated they were garbage</text>
  <text start="644.39" dur="5.85">but everyone believed it because this is</text>
  <text start="647.51" dur="4.98">what you were being told except for a</text>
  <text start="650.24" dur="4.29">few individuals that decided to look</text>
  <text start="652.49" dur="4.74">into it of course people laughed at them</text>
  <text start="654.53" dur="5.58">they made jokes about them because they</text>
  <text start="657.23" dur="5.58">wanted to short the market and actually</text>
  <text start="660.11" dur="4.29">who was laughing at the end well they</text>
  <text start="662.81" dur="3.15">were because they made billions and</text>
  <text start="664.4" dur="3.9">billions of dollars off of this because</text>
  <text start="665.96" dur="4.89">they looked into it they didn&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="668.3" dur="4.05">what people were saying and this is what</text>
  <text start="670.85" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;ve been doing we&amp;#39;ve been looking into</text>
  <text start="672.35" dur="3.72">this and we can see that this makes no</text>
  <text start="675.02" dur="2.88">sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="676.07" dur="4.83">and they&amp;#39;re having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="677.9" dur="5.82">explaining what is happening now next</text>
  <text start="680.9" dur="5.1">week June 13th and 14th the Fed is going</text>
  <text start="683.72" dur="5.57">to have a meeting right now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="695.21" dur="4.19">number unemployment manipulated number</text>
  <text start="697.73" dur="4.14">but the Fed is going to look at this and</text>
  <text start="699.4" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re going to decide should we raise</text>
  <text start="701.87" dur="5.73">rates should we lower rates and</text>
  <text start="704.05" dur="6.91">basically I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="707.6" dur="4.83">they raise rates once again because I</text>
  <text start="710.96" dur="2.73">don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re looking at any of</text>
  <text start="712.43" dur="3.18">this data they&amp;#39;re looking at what they</text>
  <text start="713.69" dur="4.41">want to look at and they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="715.61" dur="4.83">on purpose they want to bring down the</text>
  <text start="718.1" dur="3.36">economy yes they can click a mouse and</text>
  <text start="720.44" dur="4.59">bring it down but that wouldn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="721.46" dur="5.67">natural what they need to do is again</text>
  <text start="725.03" dur="4.83">they need to make the collapse look like</text>
  <text start="727.13" dur="4.53">it was a natural collapse now think</text>
  <text start="729.86" dur="4.71">about that these central banks they own</text>
  <text start="731.66" dur="5.82">a lot of stock a lot of corporations</text>
  <text start="734.57" dur="5.7">they could start selling that they raise</text>
  <text start="737.48" dur="6.12">the interest rates which triggers other</text>
  <text start="740.27" dur="5.34">economic sectors to go haywire where the</text>
  <text start="743.6" dur="2.55">economy looks like it&amp;#39;s naturally coming</text>
  <text start="745.61" dur="4.5">down</text>
  <text start="746.15" dur="6.12">now remember Trump his organization and</text>
  <text start="750.11" dur="5.19">the central bank they&amp;#39;re all trying to</text>
  <text start="752.27" dur="5.04">get the narrative of when the system</text>
  <text start="755.3" dur="4.23">comes down because if they hold the</text>
  <text start="757.31" dur="5.25">narrative they hold all the cards and</text>
  <text start="759.53" dur="5.37">this is the big fight right now now Paul</text>
  <text start="762.56" dur="3.93">Krugman is out there right now saying if</text>
  <text start="764.9" dur="4.74">you think the United States is a</text>
  <text start="766.49" dur="4.92">disaster now just wait now of course</text>
  <text start="769.64" dur="3.21">he&amp;#39;s talking about Trump and how</text>
  <text start="771.41" dur="4.17">everything is going right now because</text>
  <text start="772.85" dur="4.29">basically what he&amp;#39;s seeing is everything</text>
  <text start="775.58" dur="3.3">the deep state the central bankers have</text>
  <text start="777.14" dur="4.26">been doing all this time it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="778.88" dur="3.15">unraveling and this is why he&amp;#39;s calling</text>
  <text start="781.4" dur="2.4">it a disaster</text>
  <text start="782.03" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s a disaster for the central bank</text>
  <text start="783.8" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s a disaster for at the deep state</text>
  <text start="785.72" dur="6.84">and he realizes once this is all unwound</text>
  <text start="789.35" dur="6.75">and everything is out of the way and the</text>
  <text start="792.56" dur="8.07">economy collapses yes it will be a</text>
  <text start="796.1" dur="5.91">disaster and he&amp;#39;s hoping and those in</text>
  <text start="800.63" dur="3.48">the deep state those in the central bank</text>
  <text start="802.01" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re hoping that they can control the</text>
  <text start="804.11" dur="4.77">narrative to say see what Trump has done</text>
  <text start="806.45" dur="5.64">now Trump on the other hand he is</text>
  <text start="808.88" dur="5.85">looking to basically control the</text>
  <text start="812.09" dur="6.21">narrative and get everything in place</text>
  <text start="814.73" dur="6.69">for this collapse scenario now I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="818.3" dur="5.7">he has plans and I&amp;#39;m sure that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="821.42" dur="5.88">plans behind plans and strategies that</text>
  <text start="824" dur="6.93">he is using now one thing he needs to do</text>
  <text start="827.3" dur="6.99">is get glass-steagall back into place</text>
  <text start="830.93" dur="5.88">now this was removed back in 1999 he was</text>
  <text start="834.29" dur="5.43">put into place after the 30s so this way</text>
  <text start="836.81" dur="6.63">banks couldn&amp;#39;t speculate with depositors</text>
  <text start="839.72" dur="6.21">money it separated it but now since they</text>
  <text start="843.44" dur="4.56">removed the glass-steagall back in 1999</text>
  <text start="845.93" dur="5.73">it allowed banks to do this and this is</text>
  <text start="848" dur="6.18">why we had this big disaster happened in</text>
  <text start="851.66" dur="4.8">2008 I mean it&amp;#39;s one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="854.18" dur="4.68">now we can see that he needs to put this</text>
  <text start="856.46" dur="5.04">back into place and we could see he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="858.86" dur="4.95">already moving in that direction and</text>
  <text start="861.5" dur="4.74">he&amp;#39;s doing a lot of things that the</text>
  <text start="863.81" dur="4.62">central bankers they don&amp;#39;t want him to</text>
  <text start="866.24" dur="5.18">do they&amp;#39;d like the way it is because all</text>
  <text start="868.43" dur="6.24">the wealth flows into their pockets and</text>
  <text start="871.42" dur="5.5">they steal the wealth from the poor the</text>
  <text start="874.67" dur="3.96">middle class the rest of the world and</text>
  <text start="876.92" dur="4.2">they bring it all to them this is what</text>
  <text start="878.63" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;ve been doing all this time now</text>
  <text start="881.12" dur="4.8">what Trump is doing he is trying to set</text>
  <text start="883.91" dur="5.52">everything up for the transition period</text>
  <text start="885.92" dur="4.98">and for after the collapse occurs now we</text>
  <text start="889.43" dur="3.6">can see he&amp;#39;s been making deals with</text>
  <text start="890.9" dur="3.96">corporations to try to bring them back</text>
  <text start="893.03" dur="3.66">bring back employees this is not for</text>
  <text start="894.86" dur="4.02">right now because it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="896.69" dur="5.04">impossible in this economy</text>
  <text start="898.88" dur="4.44">he&amp;#39;s also reviewing the lands looking at</text>
  <text start="901.73" dur="3.17">the natural resources of course this is</text>
  <text start="903.32" dur="4.2">the land that they put aside for</text>
  <text start="904.9" dur="5.02">collateral on all the debt that we hold</text>
  <text start="907.52" dur="4.17">he&amp;#39;s opening up the drilling once again</text>
  <text start="909.92" dur="3.27">because once we come off the petro</text>
  <text start="911.69" dur="4.29">dollar system just like we were going on</text>
  <text start="913.19" dur="5.31">the petro dollar system oil is going to</text>
  <text start="915.98" dur="4.77">be very difficult to get from the Middle</text>
  <text start="918.5" dur="4.56">East things are going to be haywire for</text>
  <text start="920.75" dur="4.56">a little while and this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="923.06" dur="4.89">looking to have the u.s. independent of</text>
  <text start="925.31" dur="7.5">that he&amp;#39;s also looking to sell the</text>
  <text start="927.95" dur="7.38">reserves in 2018 to bring in currency</text>
  <text start="932.81" dur="5.94">into the country to keep it operational</text>
  <text start="935.33" dur="6.09">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things happening all at</text>
  <text start="938.75" dur="5.85">once and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="941.42" dur="6.69">all in preparation for the collapse now</text>
  <text start="944.6" dur="6.18">I do believe he&amp;#39;s going to try to make</text>
  <text start="948.11" dur="4.53">this a soft landing but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="950.78" dur="5.52">this is going to work because I think</text>
  <text start="952.64" dur="5.57">the economy at this time is too far gone</text>
  <text start="956.3" dur="5.01">and he was going to make the impact</text>
  <text start="958.21" dur="5.83">really soft as we move into this</text>
  <text start="961.31" dur="3.36">transition period but it seems to me</text>
  <text start="964.04" dur="3.15">right now</text>
  <text start="964.67" dur="4.98">that this is going to be a hard landing</text>
  <text start="967.19" dur="4.98">a hard transition now I think he&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="969.65" dur="5.94">under the impression to bring this down</text>
  <text start="972.17" dur="5.91">slowly but surely and make it a lot</text>
  <text start="975.59" dur="4.74">easier for the people but from</text>
  <text start="978.08" dur="5.67">everything I&amp;#39;m looking at the entire</text>
  <text start="980.33" dur="5.82">economy well it is contracting very very</text>
  <text start="983.75" dur="4.139">quickly it&amp;#39;s sliding into a depression</text>
  <text start="986.15" dur="3.51">very very quickly</text>
  <text start="987.889" dur="5.091">and I think just like the 30s just like</text>
  <text start="989.66" dur="5.82">in o8 I think it&amp;#39;s going to hit hard and</text>
  <text start="992.98" dur="4.12">there&amp;#39;s going to be no way out of this</text>
  <text start="995.48" dur="4.5">and it&amp;#39;s not going to be easy for anyone</text>
