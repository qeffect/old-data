  <text start="54.4" dur="6.63">that this new retail season in 2016 is</text>
  <text start="58.86" dur="3.19">not going to be good that people aren&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="63.61" dur="7.08">things well the UK is out there and</text>
  <text start="68.31" dur="6.91">Britain&amp;#39;s Treasury chief warned Thursday</text>
  <text start="70.69" dur="8.19">of a dangerous cocktail of new threats</text>
  <text start="75.22" dur="6.57">to the economy insisting that the</text>
  <text start="78.88" dur="7.349">country&amp;#39;s robust growth is not immune to</text>
  <text start="81.79" dur="6.329">troubles from abroad Osborne cited the</text>

  <text start="89.91" dur="6.099">commodity prices are among the key</text>
  <text start="93.07" dur="4.76">concern so basically what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="97.83" dur="5.95">everyone that yeah the economy is ready</text>
  <text start="101.92" dur="4.08">to implode here we will not be able to</text>
  <text start="103.78" dur="4.77">keep going the way we&amp;#39;ve been going and</text>
  <text start="106" dur="6.92">he went on to say that anyone who thinks</text>
  <text start="108.55" dur="6.89">its mission is basically accomplished in</text>
  <text start="112.92" dur="7">improving the economy in Britain is</text>
  <text start="115.44" dur="7.39">making a grave mistake and that is one</text>
  <text start="119.92" dur="4.649">thing I can agree on because what we are</text>
  <text start="122.83" dur="7.019">seeing right now in the global economy</text>
  <text start="124.569" dur="7.651">is that everything is starting to</text>
  <text start="129.849" dur="5.331">implode and it is accelerating I mean</text>
  <text start="132.22" dur="7.11">we&amp;#39;ve already seen where four days into</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="6.88">the new year four business days and the</text>
  <text start="139.33" dur="5.489">stock market has dropped what a thousand</text>
  <text start="142.06" dur="4.44">eleven hundred points or so I mean this</text>
  <text start="144.819" dur="4.351">is absolutely terrible now does this</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="4.709">mean that this is the crash this is the</text>
  <text start="149.17" dur="4.56">collapse know what this means is that</text>
  <text start="151.209" dur="6.691">this market is starting to rip itself</text>
  <text start="153.73" dur="8.79">apart it&amp;#39;s starting to basically do what</text>
  <text start="157.9" dur="5.84">it did prior to the crash of 2008 and of</text>
  <text start="162.52" dur="3.52">course</text>
  <text start="163.74" dur="5.49">bankers can they cannot let this happen</text>
  <text start="166.04" dur="6.58">they cannot let this market come down on</text>
  <text start="169.23" dur="6.3">its own because of course we&amp;#39;ll all look</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="6.42">at them and say well wait a minute you</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="6.84">just told us that the market the economy</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="5.72">is completely recovered you&amp;#39;re raising</text>
  <text start="182.37" dur="6.75">the interest rates you&amp;#39;re said by the</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="6.43">mid portion of this year that will be at</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="4.35">full employment and now you&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="191.19" dur="5.34">us the economy just crashed I mean it</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="6.27">would make sense so we can see at this</text>
  <text start="196.53" dur="5.69">point they&amp;#39;re manipulated numbers and</text>
  <text start="199.74" dur="4.86">what&amp;#39;s really going on is completely</text>
  <text start="202.22" dur="4.24">separating itself and for those people</text>
  <text start="204.6" dur="4.26">who think it&amp;#39;s going to get better no</text>
  <text start="206.46" dur="6.24">it&amp;#39;s not because we&amp;#39;ve been tracking</text>
  <text start="208.86" dur="5.84">this for quite a while and every time we</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="5.52">look at this if you notice the data</text>
  <text start="214.7" dur="5.89">continually gets worse and worse we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="5.61">not seeing an improvement in housing</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="6.15">actually we just realized that all the</text>
  <text start="223.83" dur="6.99">calculations were manipulated all the</text>
  <text start="226.74" dur="5.34">BLS calculations are manipulated we kind</text>
  <text start="230.82" dur="2.91">of knew that before but it&amp;#39;s nice to</text>
  <text start="232.08" dur="6.15">have a little bit of proof behind all of</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="8.31">this we see Canada well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="10.76">purchasing managers index it collapsed</text>
  <text start="242.04" dur="11.61">to an unbelievable 49.9 it it was at</text>
  <text start="248.99" dur="6.73">63.6 in November it crashed a 49.9 in</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="5.07">December one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="5.46">month-on-month drops on record and we</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="5.67">know that Canada is in a recession well</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="5.01">it looks like Canada will be heading</text>
  <text start="264.39" dur="3.72">into that deep depression now this is</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="5.79">not going to only be in Canada of course</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="7.98">this is all over the place even in</text>
  <text start="271.98" dur="7.44">Europe because what is happening right</text>
  <text start="276.09" dur="7.28">now cannot be stopped it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="279.42" dur="7.32">continue on and it&amp;#39;s going to accelerate</text>
  <text start="283.37" dur="5.79">yes can the Obama administration and the</text>
  <text start="286.74" dur="4.98">BLS come out the next month and say hey</text>
  <text start="289.16" dur="4.45">unemployment&amp;#39;s at 4.8 or four point nine</text>
  <text start="291.72" dur="4.89">percent we&amp;#39;re almost at full employment</text>
  <text start="293.61" dur="3.33">yeah they can do that but again we have</text>
  <text start="296.61" dur="3.51">to</text>
  <text start="296.94" dur="4.86">member the manipulated number compared</text>
  <text start="300.12" dur="4.41">to what&amp;#39;s really going on makes no sense</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="5.64">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="304.53" dur="5.25">reverse in the trend of initial jobless</text>
  <text start="307.44" dur="6.51">claims because they can only manipulate</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="6.96">everything so far when things start to</text>
  <text start="313.95" dur="5.19">get out of hand it gets more and more</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="6.3">difficult and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="319.14" dur="5.88">layoffs at this point and the trend of</text>
  <text start="323.04" dur="5.51">initial jobless claims which was</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="7.23">decreasing is now reversing its</text>
  <text start="328.55" dur="7.3">increasing at this point and this trend</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="5.36">will continually increase as time goes</text>
  <text start="335.85" dur="4.83">on because we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot more</text>
  <text start="337.61" dur="5.17">layoffs a lot more store closings and</text>
  <text start="340.68" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re already seeing this now everyone</text>
  <text start="342.78" dur="4.14">wants us to believe well when I say</text>
  <text start="345.84" dur="3.06">everyone I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="346.92" dur="4.16">government the Fed the corporate media</text>
  <text start="348.9" dur="5.25">they want us to believe that this was an</text>
  <text start="351.08" dur="6.91">incredible holiday season I don&amp;#39;t know I</text>
  <text start="354.15" dur="7.13">was at the mall they were empty and the</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="6.96">shelves were filled with merchandise and</text>
  <text start="361.28" dur="4.84">already we have Macy&amp;#39;s who&amp;#39;s come out</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="5.94">and said they&amp;#39;re going to be closing</text>
  <text start="366.12" dur="8.04">about 40 stores laying off about 4,800</text>
  <text start="370.89" dur="6.51">people well they&amp;#39;re blaming the weather</text>
  <text start="374.16" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re blaming the online sales they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="377.4" dur="5.22">blaming you know the moon came up too</text>
  <text start="380.19" dur="5.55">fast the ocean currents were too strong</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="4.71">El Nino was here anything they can blame</text>
  <text start="385.74" dur="3.96">it on that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing at this</text>
  <text start="387.33" dur="4.44">point but we know the real reason we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="389.7" dur="5.16">been tracking this because what makes</text>
  <text start="391.77" dur="5.46">sense is that more and more people are</text>
  <text start="394.86" dur="5.52">out of the job market more and more</text>
  <text start="397.23" dur="4.86">people are taking part time jobs more</text>
  <text start="400.38" dur="4.17">and more people aren&amp;#39;t earning the</text>
  <text start="402.09" dur="4.2">income that they used to more and more</text>
  <text start="404.55" dur="3.84">people are holding on to their money and</text>
  <text start="406.29" dur="5.84">they&amp;#39;re not going out and spending their</text>
  <text start="408.39" dur="7.89">money this is what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>

  <text start="430.19" dur="3.24">everyone&amp;#39;s employed this is what the</text>
  <text start="432.2" dur="4.53">government and the federal telling us</text>
  <text start="433.43" dur="5.82">the economy is fine we&amp;#39;re raising the</text>
  <text start="436.73" dur="4.94">interest rates but what they&amp;#39;re showing</text>
