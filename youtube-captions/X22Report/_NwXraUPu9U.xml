  <text start="92.22" dur="5.16">is coming and they do what they do best</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="5.761">they take those individuals that are</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="6.51">involved in the corruption in the</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="6.87">treason and they place them in certain</text>

  <text start="122.399" dur="4.561">are seeing but again this will not work</text>
  <text start="124.53" dur="4.519">because it&amp;#39;s not based on propaganda</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="5.249">it&amp;#39;s based on hard evidence</text>
  <text start="129.049" dur="6.041">documentation and they will not be able</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="5.041">to explain any of this yes in the</text>
  <text start="135.09" dur="3.929">beginning stages they will come out and</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="4.049">they&amp;#39;ll tell you this incredible story</text>
  <text start="139.019" dur="5.011">and they&amp;#39;ll try to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="141.299" dur="5.25">this is what really happened but as more</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="4.5">and more evidence comes out and more</text>
  <text start="146.549" dur="5.521">documentation with their signatures and</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="6.72">what they&amp;#39;ve done and how they did it</text>
  <text start="152.07" dur="5.4">where most of it is a cover-up and they</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="5.489">implemented these things after they</text>
  <text start="157.47" dur="6.66">spied this is going to be a problem for</text>
  <text start="160.739" dur="6.061">them and we see that CNN the</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="6.18">bringing on former FBI deputy director</text>
  <text start="166.8" dur="6.06">Andrew McCabe as a contributor think</text>
  <text start="170.31" dur="5.28">about all the individuals that are</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="5.9">working with the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="7.02">clapper Brennan McCabe and the rest</text>
  <text start="178.76" dur="7.57">there&amp;#39;s a reason for this because they</text>
  <text start="182.61" dur="7.23">need these individuals to help shape the</text>

  <text start="189.84" dur="4.11">worked in the old days when the</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="6">intelligence organizations had control</text>
  <text start="193.95" dur="6.54">it&amp;#39;s not going to help in the future now</text>
  <text start="198.03" dur="5.85">the deep state they are becoming very</text>
  <text start="200.49" dur="6.36">very desperate Nadler is begging for</text>
  <text start="203.88" dur="5.31">something some type of evidence to</text>
  <text start="206.85" dur="6.78">impeach trump Doug Collins tweeted out</text>
  <text start="209.19" dur="7.11">the following June Nadler says the Mulla</text>
  <text start="213.63" dur="7.65">report has ample evidence of impeachable</text>
  <text start="216.3" dur="7.47">conduct July Muller speaks August Nadler</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="5.33">begs other chairman for help</text>
  <text start="223.77" dur="7.08">gathering any evidence of impeachable</text>
  <text start="226.61" dur="7.06">conduct what does that tell you it tells</text>
  <text start="230.85" dur="5.73">you they are desperate it tells you</text>
  <text start="233.67" dur="6.09">everything that Nadler said about Muller</text>
  <text start="236.58" dur="6.39">and how it has ample evidence they have</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="5.13">nothing because if you have something</text>
  <text start="242.97" dur="4.26">you don&amp;#39;t have to beg other Chairman you</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t have to look for it you already</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="5.46">have him remember Adam Schiff he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="4.29">telling us that he has all the evidence</text>
  <text start="252.69" dur="4.59">of Russian collusion wisent why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="254.22" dur="5.489">they use this because there is none it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.28" dur="7.56">called propaganda and when you call</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="7.741">people on propaganda it falls apart but</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="6.12">there&amp;#39;s a problem with Nadler as he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="5.85">trying to push impeachment a Monmouth</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="5.04">University poll shows a majority of</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="8.34">Americans oppose attempts to impeach</text>
  <text start="276" dur="8.04">Trump and the latest poll shows about</text>
  <text start="281.64" dur="4.92">one fifth of those who disapprove of</text>
  <text start="284.04" dur="4.83">Trump&amp;#39;s job performance draw nearly all</text>
  <text start="286.56" dur="4.11">of those who approve of the President to</text>
  <text start="288.87" dur="6.62">say that moving ahead with an</text>
  <text start="290.67" dur="4.82">impeachment inquiry is a bad idea</text>
  <text start="296.42" dur="10.95">basically 59% oppose impeachment this is</text>
  <text start="302.84" dur="6.39">a dead end for Nadler he knows it they</text>
  <text start="307.37" dur="5.46">all know it this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="309.23" dur="5.4">scrambling now very interestingly as we</text>
  <text start="312.83" dur="5.13">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff that is</text>
  <text start="314.63" dur="6.84">about to drop do we know exactly when no</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="5.97">and we can see that the deep state</text>
  <text start="321.47" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re being monitored certain players</text>
  <text start="323.93" dur="5.64">remember FISA works both ways</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="5.58">and they&amp;#39;re speaking in code now we know</text>
  <text start="329.57" dur="6">that evergreen is the Secret Service</text>
  <text start="331.94" dur="6.03">named for Clinton and the first time</text>
  <text start="335.57" dur="5.46">that we brought this up was Jake Tapper</text>
  <text start="337.97" dur="4.32">and he tweeted out evergreen and he was</text>
  <text start="341.03" dur="4.11">replying to a tweet that said this is</text>
  <text start="342.29" dur="5.91">going to get a lot worse well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.14" dur="6.56">talking to Clinton then we have Kirsten</text>
  <text start="348.2" dur="9.53">Gillibrand she just tweeted out</text>
  <text start="351.7" dur="8.79">evergreen messages are being sent and</text>
  <text start="357.73" dur="5.71">it&amp;#39;s just odd that they keep using</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="6.25">Clinton&amp;#39;s Secret Service name this is</text>
  <text start="363.44" dur="6.45">not a coincidence this is messages going</text>
  <text start="366.74" dur="7.23">back and forth now very interestingly we</text>
  <text start="369.89" dur="7.35">know that Patrick Byrne he resigned as</text>
  <text start="373.97" dur="5.81">CEO of overstock then he hit the</text>
  <text start="377.24" dur="7.32">airwaves to explain what is happening</text>
  <text start="379.78" dur="8.08">Patrick Byrne named Peter struck bill</text>
  <text start="384.56" dur="6.36">pre stabbed Andrew McCabe and James</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="5.73">Comey as the top of an operation where</text>
  <text start="390.92" dur="5.52">Byrne was instructed to guide boo Tina</text>
  <text start="393.59" dur="7.5">into the contact circle of Republican</text>
  <text start="396.44" dur="7.98">presidential candidates in 2015 and then</text>
  <text start="401.09" dur="5.07">they told them to back away curiously if</text>
  <text start="404.42" dur="4.32">you get beyond the confusing mess of</text>
  <text start="406.16" dur="5.49">communication what Bern is describing</text>
  <text start="408.74" dur="5.91">that&amp;#39;s factually aligned with what is</text>
  <text start="411.65" dur="4.5">already known however Bern is describing</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="3.78">an aspect to the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="416.15" dur="5.07">FBI operation that has not been</text>
  <text start="418.43" dur="5.16">discussed very much Bern is describing</text>
  <text start="421.22" dur="5.73">the Department of Justice NSD an FBI</text>

  <text start="433.22" dur="7.11">listen to what Patrick Byrne had to say</text>
  <text start="436.12" dur="7.18">I was given some fishy orders and I</text>
  <text start="440.33" dur="4.26">carried them out thinking I in 2015-2016</text>
  <text start="443.3" dur="3.03">thinking I was conducting law</text>
  <text start="444.59" dur="3.9">enforcement let me emphasize don&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="446.33" dur="4.53">the FBI the FBI was barely involved in</text>

  <text start="450.86" dur="4.92">the men in black as I called them showed</text>
  <text start="453.71" dur="4.62">up and asked for this third favor and I</text>
  <text start="455.78" dur="4.65">and well anyway I&amp;#39;m not gonna go into</text>
  <text start="458.33" dur="4.29">the details right now but I didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="460.43" dur="3.72">who sent the orders but I did them they</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="3.39">seemed fishy last summer watching</text>
  <text start="464.15" dur="4.08">television and here&amp;#39;s the punchline</text>
  <text start="466.01" dur="3.66">here&amp;#39;s the punchline people last summer</text>
  <text start="468.23" dur="3.24">watching television and some</text>

  <text start="504.11" dur="4.56">well the nitty-gritty I can tell you the</text>
  <text start="506.72" dur="3.57">main event and I feel terrible I&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="533.15" dur="5.07">coming to the public here&amp;#39;s what it is</text>
  <text start="536.09" dur="6.66">this was all political espionage</text>
  <text start="538.22" dur="7.77">conducted against Hillary Clinton Rubio</text>
  <text start="542.75" dur="5.58">Cruz and Trump this is not a theory of</text>
  <text start="545.99" dur="4.74">mine some political theory I was in the</text>
  <text start="548.33" dur="6.21">room when it happened in a way not in a</text>
  <text start="550.73" dur="6.06">way I was part of it I didn&amp;#39;t know I</text>
  <text start="554.54" dur="3.9">knew I had some of the pieces I thought</text>
  <text start="556.79" dur="4.89">had the pieces of something much bigger</text>
  <text start="558.44" dur="4.059">last summer as stuff bubbled into the</text>
  <text start="561.68" dur="4.019">news thing</text>
  <text start="562.499" dur="5.58">good journalists such as yourself I</text>
  <text start="565.699" dur="4.36">started realizing I had these very</text>
  <text start="568.079" dur="5.37">important missing pieces I actually</text>
  <text start="570.059" dur="5.88">started coming trying to help then but I</text>
  <text start="573.449" dur="4.26">had to wait until there was a return to</text>
  <text start="575.939" dur="3.24">rule of law in our country and I&amp;#39;ve look</text>
  <text start="577.709" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;ve lived in places where there 8 and</text>
  <text start="579.179" dur="4.38">that took waiting until bill Barr got it</text>
  <text start="581.669" dur="4.8">got installed and then I&amp;#39;m Jenna I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="583.559" dur="4.71">know the guy that I never say contain or</text>
  <text start="586.469" dur="3">anything but only then did I trust</text>
  <text start="588.269" dur="5.28">things enough and I went to the</text>
  <text start="589.469" dur="5.64">Department of Justice you know now</text>
  <text start="593.549" dur="6.86">throughout this interview and this was</text>
  <text start="595.109" dur="9.84">just a clip Patrick Byrne also mentioned</text>
  <text start="600.409" dur="5.89">Carlin now most likely this is John</text>
  <text start="604.949" dur="2.73">Carlin who was the head of the</text>
  <text start="606.299" dur="4.98">Department of Justice National Security</text>
  <text start="607.679" dur="6.12">Division until October 2016 now when we</text>
  <text start="611.279" dur="5.04">start to put all this together it seems</text>
  <text start="613.799" dur="4.53">Patrick Byrne is describing how Murray</text>
  <text start="616.319" dur="4.59">abou Tina a Russian national</text>
  <text start="618.329" dur="5.34">was allowed to run around in Republican</text>
  <text start="620.909" dur="6.24">political circles by the FBI so they</text>
  <text start="623.669" dur="7.26">could create the impression of Russian</text>
  <text start="627.149" dur="6.78">infiltrators in and around Rubio Cruz</text>
  <text start="630.929" dur="6.65">and the Trump campaign now think about</text>
  <text start="633.929" dur="7.08">this for a second as a Russian national</text>
  <text start="637.579" dur="7.36">the Department of Justice FBI wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="641.009" dur="6.09">need a surveillance warrant that would</text>
  <text start="644.939" dur="5.19">make Maria boo Tina essentially a</text>
  <text start="647.099" dur="5.07">walking a bola surveillance virus and</text>
  <text start="650.129" dur="6.65">any American she came into contact with</text>
  <text start="652.169" dur="9.54">would be infected for a legal FISA 702</text>
  <text start="656.779" dur="7.9">surveillance so they took miss boo Tina</text>
  <text start="661.709" dur="7.2">into Rubio Cruz Trump campaigns and</text>
  <text start="664.679" dur="7.11">voila legal FISA 702 searches</text>

  <text start="671.789" dur="7.68">authorized unmasking etc now let&amp;#39;s look</text>
  <text start="676.169" dur="4.59">at the letter from boo Tina&amp;#39;s former</text>
  <text start="679.469" dur="4.74">lawyer - Inspector General Michael</text>

  <text start="1504.91" dur="4.2">we unmask once we authorize an unmasking</text>
  <text start="1506.77" dur="3.84">we authorized the unmasking only to that</text>
  <text start="1509.11" dur="3.6">individual what I mean by that so if we</text>
  <text start="1510.61" dur="3.27">unmask a report I they went to a</text>
  <text start="1512.71" dur="3.69">particular individual</text>

  <text start="1520.09" dur="5.49">are specifically told use the</text>
  <text start="1522.61" dur="4.68">classification yes sir general Flynn was</text>
  <text start="1525.58" dur="3.3">caught up in a conversation with a</text>
  <text start="1527.29" dur="3.33">Russian ambassador you&amp;#39;re familiar with</text>
  <text start="1528.88" dur="4.44">that story I&amp;#39;m familiar with the story</text>
  <text start="1530.62" dur="5.85">yes sir assuming he did not have a FISA</text>
  <text start="1533.32" dur="4.59">warrant allowing us to collect on him it</text>
  <text start="1536.47" dur="2.64">would be a case of incident or</text>
  <text start="1537.91" dur="3.72">collection following the Russian</text>
  <text start="1539.11" dur="6.03">ambassador does that make sense yes sir</text>
  <text start="1541.63" dur="6.69">okay we would know who how that</text>
  <text start="1545.14" dur="5.91">conversation was revealed into who it</text>
  <text start="1548.32" dur="4.89">was revealed through the did the request</text>
  <text start="1551.05" dur="3.99">of your agency if we unmasked and it was</text>
  <text start="1553.21" dur="3.81">based on an NSA report let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="1555.04" dur="3.72">remember if I say won&amp;#39;t be the only</text>
  <text start="1557.02" dur="3.24">agent that potentially could have gotten</text>
  <text start="1558.76" dur="3.45">the conversation yes that&amp;#39;s you but</text>
  <text start="1560.26" dur="3.99">you&amp;#39;re the primary one right um</text>
  <text start="1562.21" dur="4.02">I would argue again it depends if you</text>
  <text start="1564.25" dur="3.84">look at title one warrants for his FBI</text>
  <text start="1566.23" dur="4.05">is I&amp;#39;m not talking about warrants I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1568.09" dur="5.31">talking about incidental so I would</text>
  <text start="1570.28" dur="5.4">argue there&amp;#39;s probably a greater</text>
  <text start="1573.4" dur="3.78">potential on the FBI side than NSA just</text>
  <text start="1575.68" dur="4.02">in terms generally in terms of</text>
  <text start="1577.18" dur="4.86">collection events of incidental with US</text>
  <text start="1579.7" dur="6.51">persons okay so we could do this the FBI</text>
  <text start="1582.04" dur="7.04">are you yes sir okay so somebody took</text>
  <text start="1586.21" dur="5.91">that information that we gain through</text>
  <text start="1589.08" dur="5.41">collection of with Flynn and gave it to</text>
  <text start="1592.12" dur="4.11">the Washington Post somehow it got to</text>
  <text start="1594.49" dur="3.15">the media that&amp;#39;s clear that is a crime</text>
  <text start="1596.23" dur="4.41">and that&amp;#39;s a leak and that is illegal</text>
  <text start="1597.64" dur="8.34">yes sir hey so what they&amp;#39;re saying here</text>
  <text start="1600.64" dur="8.85">is they have all the documentation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1605.98" dur="7.32">tracked and they know exactly who took</text>
  <text start="1609.49" dur="5.46">it who had it now of course when asked</text>
  <text start="1613.3" dur="4.68">do you know who leaked it to the</text>
  <text start="1614.95" dur="5.64">Washington Post no you don&amp;#39;t but whoever</text>
  <text start="1617.98" dur="4.11">got that information</text>
  <text start="1620.59" dur="3.449">they&amp;#39;re the ones who would have done it</text>
  <text start="1622.09" dur="5.159">or if they didn&amp;#39;t do it that means they</text>
  <text start="1624.039" dur="4.801">shared it with someone else which is</text>
  <text start="1627.249" dur="6.9">highly illegal the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="1628.84" dur="8.76">illegal so they have a record of who has</text>
  <text start="1634.149" dur="5.25">this information and they&amp;#39;re true and</text>
  <text start="1637.6" dur="4.319">they tracked it down already and they</text>
  <text start="1639.399" dur="7.35">already know and this brings me back to</text>
