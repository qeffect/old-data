  <text start="73.18" dur="5.899">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="76.03" dur="7.58">news and we&amp;#39;re going to start off with</text>
  <text start="79.079" dur="9.071">Cyprus what&amp;#39;s happening there is</text>
  <text start="83.61" dur="11.73">deposits in the banks are at an all-time</text>
  <text start="88.15" dur="9.749">low they are basically non-existent</text>
  <text start="95.34" dur="5.5">because what&amp;#39;s happening is they have</text>
  <text start="97.899" dur="6.75">capital controls in effect it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="100.84" dur="6.029">over a hundred days and nobody can open</text>
  <text start="104.649" dur="4.86">in the count you still can&amp;#39;t take that</text>
  <text start="106.869" dur="5.61">much money out and no one in their right</text>
  <text start="109.509" dur="5.341">mind foreign investors or people who are</text>
  <text start="112.479" dur="7.591">in Cyprus are going to put money into</text>
  <text start="114.85" dur="8.28">these banks because the the government</text>
  <text start="120.07" dur="5.43">and the IMF and the European Community</text>
  <text start="123.13" dur="5.129">and the central bankers have proven that</text>
  <text start="125.5" dur="4.89">if you put money in there we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="128.259" dur="4.891">take it from you so who in their right</text>
  <text start="130.39" dur="5.97">mind would do that so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="133.15" dur="3.87">seeing is that the central bank of</text>
  <text start="136.36" dur="2.58">cyprus</text>
  <text start="137.02" dur="4.43">ported that not only did local deposits</text>
  <text start="138.94" dur="6.06">dropped to a level not seen in 2007</text>
  <text start="141.45" dur="6.88">pledging at the second-fastest absolute</text>
  <text start="145" dur="6.54">amount in history but declined at the</text>
  <text start="148.33" dur="7.26">fastest rate ever and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="8.04">going to this situation right here is is</text>
  <text start="155.59" dur="6.6">going to hurt Cyprus even more and again</text>
  <text start="159.58" dur="4.74">the central bankers do not care about</text>
  <text start="162.19" dur="4.23">that they want the government&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="164.32" dur="4.35">suffer they want the government&amp;#39;s to be</text>
  <text start="166.42" dur="4.62">put into more debt they want the people</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="5.1">to be out of work because what do these</text>
  <text start="171.04" dur="6.93">central bankers want they want to own</text>
  <text start="173.77" dur="7.58">the natural resources of each country</text>
  <text start="177.97" dur="8.13">that is what they&amp;#39;re looking to do and</text>
  <text start="181.35" dur="8.58">in Greece what&amp;#39;s happening there is the</text>
  <text start="186.1" dur="10.83">unemployment is very high it&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="9.25">people can&amp;#39;t find work about 23% don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="196.93" dur="5.49">earn enough to stay above the poverty</text>
  <text start="199.18" dur="8.54">line and the people are fleeing Greece</text>
  <text start="202.42" dur="8.25">looking for work elsewhere and you know</text>
  <text start="207.72" dur="5.44">why are these why would these people say</text>
  <text start="210.67" dur="6.18">in Greece I mean for the Greek</text>
  <text start="213.16" dur="6.799">government to get a bailout from the EU</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="6.75">they have to lay off approximately</text>
  <text start="219.959" dur="7.391">25,000 employees from the government I</text>
  <text start="223.6" dur="5.25">think 12,500 right now and then down the</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="4.65">line they have it split up around</text>
  <text start="228.85" dur="5.64">another 12,500 to put themselves into</text>
  <text start="232" dur="4.47">more debt and what that means is there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.49" dur="4.38">going to be more people looking for work</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="5.1">so this is not going to help the</text>
  <text start="238.87" dur="4.53">situation and the people are looking at</text>
  <text start="241.57" dur="4.74">this and saying we need to get out of</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="6.72">here and go someplace else where we can</text>
  <text start="246.31" dur="7.71">actually make money and live and get out</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="6.9">of this poverty that we&amp;#39;re in now there</text>
  <text start="254.02" dur="5.07">was an article on zerohedge where it</text>
  <text start="257.02" dur="4.589">said that whenever the annual change in</text>
  <text start="259.09" dur="4.68">the core capex also known as the</text>
  <text start="261.609" dur="6.06">non-defense capital goods excluding</text>
  <text start="263.77" dur="6.72">aircraft shipments goes negative the US</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="5.421">has traditionally entered a</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="5.07">session and the number is around</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="6.52">positive point eight percent and</text>
  <text start="275.56" dur="11.07">declining fast and you know if we look</text>
  <text start="279.61" dur="9.33">back in January it was around 14 and now</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="7.23">it has dropped all the way to point 8</text>
  <text start="288.94" dur="8.58">and this looks like we are headed for a</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="6.48">recession / depression because you have</text>
  <text start="297.52" dur="6.119">to remember the US Fed is holding about</text>
  <text start="300.34" dur="6">3.5 trillion in securities and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.639" dur="5.581">increasing at a pace of 85 billion per</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="5.88">month they&amp;#39;re buying pretty much half of</text>
  <text start="309.22" dur="4.68">it in toxic real estate and the other</text>
  <text start="312.22" dur="3.93">half they&amp;#39;re buying Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="313.9" dur="6.69">because nobody else will purchase the</text>
  <text start="316.15" dur="8.1">Treasury bonds at this point now to keep</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="6.54">the housing bubble alive what the</text>
  <text start="324.25" dur="6.449">regulators are planning to do they are</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="6.36">planning to decrease the amount that</text>
  <text start="330.699" dur="5.641">people have to put down on a mortgage</text>
  <text start="333.49" dur="8.19">down to around five percent or so or</text>
  <text start="336.34" dur="7.35">even lower and where most people and</text>
  <text start="341.68" dur="5.22">this is what happened back in two</text>
  <text start="343.69" dur="6.12">thousand five to two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="346.9" dur="6">where people had no money down five</text>
  <text start="349.81" dur="6.51">percent they were taking out arms and</text>
  <text start="352.9" dur="5.13">not worrying about fixing in to the new</text>
  <text start="356.32" dur="5.01">interest rate until maybe you know five</text>
  <text start="358.03" dur="6.66">years later three years later and this</text>
  <text start="361.33" dur="5.76">pretty much caused a lot of the problems</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="7.349">along with what the banks were doing</text>
  <text start="367.09" dur="11.1">with the subprime and and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="372.039" dur="9.78">the same exact pattern again and there</text>
  <text start="378.19" dur="6.27">what what the central bank and the the</text>
  <text start="381.819" dur="4.891">Fed are trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="384.46" dur="4.32">to keep the housing market afloat</text>
  <text start="386.71" dur="5.449">because you remember mortgage rates are</text>
  <text start="388.78" dur="7.5">going up when mortgage rates going up</text>
  <text start="392.159" dur="7.331">people who normally can afford a house</text>
  <text start="396.28" dur="6.87">it pushes them out of the market because</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="4.62">now they need to come up with more money</text>
  <text start="403.15" dur="2.16">for their</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="4.62">monthly payments because the interest</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="5.85">rate is higher they do not have the down</text>
  <text start="408.73" dur="4.68">payment so they were getting to know the</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="6">no down payment loans were the five</text>
  <text start="413.41" dur="6.57">percent loans and now as the interest</text>
  <text start="417.16" dur="4.5">rates go up it kind of pushes them out</text>
  <text start="419.98" dur="4.26">of the market and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="421.66" dur="7.05">bring people back and they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="424.24" dur="10.44">very difficult time keeping the real</text>
  <text start="428.71" dur="9.87">estate bubble inflating now DR Horton</text>
  <text start="434.68" dur="7.53">which is a home builder their stocks are</text>
  <text start="438.58" dur="6.27">down about four percent and this goes on</text>
  <text start="442.21" dur="5.7">to say despite any and every talking</text>
  <text start="444.85" dur="4.95">head reassurance that rising more rising</text>
  <text start="447.91" dur="3.69">mortgage rates won&amp;#39;t impact the</text>
  <text start="449.8" dur="4.23">awesomeness of the housing recovery it</text>
  <text start="451.6" dur="5.19">seems the actual home builders have a</text>
  <text start="454.03" dur="6.39">different view home builders shocked and</text>
  <text start="456.79" dur="7.05">disturbed by rate jump DR Horton CEO</text>
  <text start="460.42" dur="7.11">says disappoint disappointed rates rose</text>
  <text start="463.84" dur="7.89">so violently DR Horton CEO says traffic</text>
  <text start="467.53" dur="7.37">count has slowed since rate rise so even</text>
  <text start="471.73" dur="5.73">the home builders are reporting that</text>
  <text start="474.9" dur="5.77">their traffic for people coming in</text>
  <text start="477.46" dur="6.21">purchasing homes has declined we have</text>
  <text start="480.67" dur="5.31">seen mortgage applications plunge we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="483.67" dur="4.38">seen more people moving into arms</text>
  <text start="485.98" dur="5.13">instead because the interest is much</text>
  <text start="488.05" dur="8.07">lower and it seems like we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="491.11" dur="7.62">into this same exact repeat of prior to</text>
  <text start="496.12" dur="5.99">2008 in the crash the only difference</text>
  <text start="498.73" dur="6.62">this time is again the Fed is purchasing</text>
  <text start="502.11" dur="6.4">the the 40 to 45 billion of</text>
  <text start="505.35" dur="6.07">mortgage-backed securities the toxic</text>

  <text start="511.42" dur="7.11">number of foreclosures still on the</text>
  <text start="513.97" dur="7.97">banks is very high and the amount of</text>

  <text start="529.9" dur="6.12">they lost their home they lost their job</text>
  <text start="532.93" dur="4.69">and now they&amp;#39;re renting so we have a</text>
  <text start="536.02" dur="7.66">very very</text>
