  <text start="139.489" dur="5.401">yourself now we know that things are</text>
  <text start="142.7" dur="5.19">completely breaking down in the United</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="7.16">States and we&amp;#39;re starting to see signs</text>
  <text start="147.89" dur="6.69">of an auto bubble and these signs are</text>
  <text start="152.05" dur="5.829">basically getting stronger and stronger</text>
  <text start="154.58" dur="6.54">as we move into 2017 we are now seeing</text>
  <text start="157.879" dur="7.021">soaring delinquencies in two hundred and</text>
  <text start="161.12" dur="6.539">sixty-six subprime abs deals and this</text>
  <text start="164.9" dur="6">cannot be good at all a recent report</text>
  <text start="167.659" dur="8.041">from jean ding a Morgan Stanley took a</text>
  <text start="170.9" dur="7.29">look at 266 subprime auto ABS deals to</text>
  <text start="175.7" dur="5.04">assess the underlying health of the auto</text>
  <text start="178.19" dur="3.81">loan market now remember we discussed</text>
  <text start="180.74" dur="5.16">this before</text>
  <text start="182" dur="6.09">and let&amp;#39;s go back to 2008 yes back in</text>
  <text start="185.9" dur="4.44">2008 there was something called subprime</text>
  <text start="188.09" dur="3.72">securities where they took all these</text>
  <text start="190.34" dur="4.26">different loans and they wrapped it up</text>
  <text start="191.81" dur="5.1">into this nice security and sold it off</text>
  <text start="194.6" dur="4.26">to pension funds and other people and</text>
  <text start="196.91" dur="3.18">they were rated triple-a and they told</text>
  <text start="198.86" dur="2.55">everything these are great investments</text>
  <text start="200.09" dur="3.39">you can get a good return on it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="201.41" dur="4.26">very very safe well today they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="5.34">the same thing with auto loans is it as</text>
  <text start="205.67" dur="5.82">big as the housing market no but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="208.82" dur="6.57">still a big deal because what they found</text>
  <text start="211.49" dur="5.49">is that the health of these loans well</text>
  <text start="215.39" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re complete garbage</text>
  <text start="216.98" dur="6.24">just like the subprime securities and</text>
  <text start="220.4" dur="5.88">what they&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="223.22" dur="6.739">there are a huge amount of delinquencies</text>
  <text start="226.28" dur="6.51">that are 60 plus days old in these</text>
  <text start="229.959" dur="6.941">securities and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="232.79" dur="6.919">that this is an auto loan bubble now</text>
  <text start="236.9" dur="4.71">remember they they reduced the</text>
  <text start="239.709" dur="3.461">qualifications of what you needed to</text>
  <text start="241.61" dur="3.06">take out a loan and they continually</text>
  <text start="243.17" dur="2.73">brought it down actually they just made</text>
  <text start="244.67" dur="3.03">an announcement and we talked about it</text>
  <text start="245.9" dur="4.14">before where they&amp;#39;re lowering their</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="3.72">scores so more people can come into the</text>
  <text start="250.04" dur="3.78">market because what&amp;#39;s happening now is</text>
  <text start="251.42" dur="4.11">they are running out of those people</text>
  <text start="253.82" dur="3.93">first they started out with the good</text>
  <text start="255.53" dur="4.199">credit people then they move down to</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="3.9">okay not so great let&amp;#39;s move down to</text>
  <text start="259.729" dur="5.011">this level then they had to bring in the</text>
  <text start="261.65" dur="6.21">subprime now they have to readjust these</text>
  <text start="264.74" dur="4.65">numbers and make it so more people can</text>
  <text start="267.86" dur="3.57">come into the market because what is</text>
  <text start="269.39" dur="4.62">happening right now to keep this system</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="5.25">alive to keep it all running they need</text>
  <text start="274.01" dur="4.59">to spread the debt and when we&amp;#39;re when</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="4.92">we look at the auto loan market right</text>
  <text start="278.6" dur="6.3">now we see there&amp;#39;s a lease bubble we see</text>
  <text start="281.6" dur="5.94">there&amp;#39;s a subprime bubble and this is</text>
  <text start="284.9" dur="4.769">not going to end very well whatsoever</text>
  <text start="287.54" dur="5.79">now something very interesting today</text>
  <text start="289.669" dur="5.611">they revised the fourth-quarter GP GDP</text>
  <text start="293.33" dur="4.5">in 2016 when Obama was president and</text>
  <text start="295.28" dur="5.61">they revised it higher to two point one</text>
  <text start="297.83" dur="5.73">percent and the B ei did this before it</text>
  <text start="300.89" dur="4.98">was 1.8% and they&amp;#39;re saying this was</text>
  <text start="303.56" dur="4.35">driven by a sharp upward reversion to</text>
  <text start="305.87" dur="4.049">consumer spending which includes guess</text>
  <text start="307.91" dur="3.33">what healthcare and that&amp;#39;s what brought</text>
  <text start="309.919" dur="4.101">that up because we know the holiday</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="4.97">season was a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="314.02" dur="4.649">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="5.34">revising all the numbers to show that</text>
  <text start="318.669" dur="4.53">during Obama&amp;#39;s administration and a lot</text>
  <text start="321.55" dur="3.6">of people only remember the end part of</text>
  <text start="323.199" dur="4.44">it where look in the third quarter was</text>
  <text start="325.15" dur="4.919">that 3.1 percent it was at two point one</text>
  <text start="327.639" dur="4.4">percent in fourth quarter they want to</text>
  <text start="330.069" dur="5.1">show that there was a strong economy</text>
  <text start="332.039" dur="5.231">during this period of time and what</text>
  <text start="335.169" dur="4.381">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is already that</text>
  <text start="337.27" dur="4.679">the Atlanta Fed is predicting that the</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="4.619">first quarter GDP in 2017 is going to be</text>
  <text start="341.949" dur="4.831">0.9 percent now of course they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="344.169" dur="4.771">say well this has to do with Trump and</text>
  <text start="346.78" dur="3.78">this is what happened when he tried to</text>
  <text start="348.94" dur="4.11">push his different policies and</text>
  <text start="350.56" dur="4.8">healthcare and everything else so right</text>
  <text start="353.05" dur="5.369">now they&amp;#39;re trying to build it up to</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="6.54">make it look like coming from Obama the</text>
  <text start="358.419" dur="6.93">economy was doing fantastic but we do</text>
  <text start="361.9" dur="6.48">have a major warning here the CBO right</text>
  <text start="365.349" dur="5.761">now released a report and it is looking</text>
  <text start="368.38" dur="5.24">at the long-term u.s. budget outlook and</text>
  <text start="371.11" dur="5.549">the Budget Office right now is</text>
  <text start="373.62" dur="5.769">forecasting that the government debt and</text>
  <text start="376.659" dur="5.85">deficits well they&amp;#39;re expected to soar</text>
  <text start="379.389" dur="5.28">in the next thirty years now that seems</text>
  <text start="382.509" dur="4.111">like a very long time what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="384.669" dur="5.881">really saying when we break down this</text>
  <text start="386.62" dur="5.28">report is that debt to GDP well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.55" dur="4.38">going to hit about a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="391.9" dur="5.16">percent in the next 30 years but if we</text>
  <text start="394.93" dur="4.739">look at what they&amp;#39;re really trying to</text>
  <text start="397.06" dur="5.34">say is that we have so much debt right</text>
  <text start="399.669" dur="6.271">now that we won&amp;#39;t even make it to that</text>
  <text start="402.4" dur="5.389">time period we have been set up and we</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="4.77">look it looks like there&amp;#39;s a catastrophe</text>
  <text start="407.789" dur="5.021">over the horizon right now and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.71" dur="4.889">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="412.81" dur="7.44">that during the presidency of Obama</text>
  <text start="415.599" dur="6.961">where he increased the debt load on the</text>
  <text start="420.25" dur="3.81">country by 10 trillion and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="422.56" dur="2.609">talking about the unfunded liabilities</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="2.82">let&amp;#39;s just go with the number that the</text>
  <text start="425.169" dur="3.75">corporate media is putting out there 10</text>
  <text start="426.88" dur="6.24">trillion so when he came into office in</text>
  <text start="428.919" dur="6.331">2008 it was around 9 to 10 trillion</text>
  <text start="433.12" dur="6.359">dollars he was in office for eight years</text>
  <text start="435.25" dur="7.229">and raised it another 10 the CBO never</text>
  <text start="439.479" dur="6.87">warned about anything now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="442.479" dur="5.521">warning we have a major problem now the</text>
  <text start="446.349" dur="4.591">office expects the deaf</text>
  <text start="448" dur="6.78">to Bohr than triple from the projected</text>
  <text start="450.94" dur="6.45">2.9 percent of GDP in 2017 29.8% and</text>
  <text start="454.78" dur="5.25">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that during the</text>
  <text start="457.39" dur="6.03">next couple of years or actually the</text>
  <text start="460.03" dur="6.24">next three decades they don&amp;#39;t expect GDP</text>
  <text start="463.42" dur="5.4">to get over two percent and remember</text>
  <text start="466.27" dur="5.25">that is the manipulated number so it</text>
  <text start="468.82" dur="4.83">looks like we&amp;#39;re in a whole lot of</text>
  <text start="471.52" dur="4.49">trouble right here basically what</text>
  <text start="473.65" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re saying is that this economy is</text>
  <text start="476.01" dur="4.93">doomed and we know it&amp;#39;s doomed we see</text>
  <text start="479.32" dur="3.9">foreign investors right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.94" dur="5.46">dumping Japanese bonds and stocks at an</text>
  <text start="483.22" dur="5.37">almost record pace last week as the</text>
  <text start="486.4" dur="4.86">first quarter ended foreigners sold</text>
  <text start="488.59" dur="7.38">about 1.9 to 3 trillion yen in Japanese</text>
  <text start="491.26" dur="5.159">bonds and 77 154 billion yen in Japanese</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="3.18">stocks</text>
  <text start="496.419" dur="5.971">this was the second largest dump of</text>
  <text start="499.15" dur="5.269">Japanese assets in history this is also</text>
  <text start="502.39" dur="7.05">the biggest first quarter plunge ever</text>
  <text start="504.419" dur="7.031">since 2008 so these individuals they</text>
  <text start="509.44" dur="5.779">they know something is happening right</text>
  <text start="511.45" dur="7.17">now they understand that the economy is</text>
  <text start="515.219" dur="5.26">deteriorating these insiders are getting</text>
  <text start="518.62" dur="6">out just like here in the United States</text>
  <text start="520.479" dur="7.141">and we can see right now that the elite</text>
  <text start="524.62" dur="6">the central bankers those individuals</text>
  <text start="527.62" dur="6.21">they don&amp;#39;t want cash leaving the banks</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="6.12">and we can see right now that they are</text>
  <text start="533.83" dur="6.03">definitely keeping track of those</text>
  <text start="536.74" dur="5.88">individuals who are removing cash from</text>
  <text start="539.86" dur="5.25">the bank if you can get the cash for</text>
  <text start="542.62" dur="4.38">example out in New Zealand banks are</text>
  <text start="545.11" dur="5.13">being ordered to provide police with</text>
  <text start="547" dur="5.46">customer details on each and every cash</text>
  <text start="550.24" dur="3.69">transaction over ten thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="552.46" dur="3">and of course they&amp;#39;re saying this is a</text>
  <text start="553.93" dur="4.83">crackdown on money laundering and</text>
  <text start="555.46" dur="4.71">everything else but it&amp;#39;s your money you</text>
  <text start="558.76" dur="2.67">put the money in there could be sitting</text>
  <text start="560.17" dur="3.33">in there for many many years and you</text>
  <text start="561.43" dur="4.92">wanted to take it out in cash what is</text>
  <text start="563.5" dur="5.16">the big deal you&amp;#39;ve had an account with</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="4.32">this Bank for how many years and all of</text>
  <text start="568.66" dur="4.95">a sudden they believe that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="5.4">laundering money does this make any</text>
  <text start="573.61" dur="3.96">sense so under the new rules banks will</text>
  <text start="576.07" dur="3.63">give police personal information</text>
  <text start="577.57" dur="3.87">including names location and even phone</text>
  <text start="579.7" dur="5.369">numbers of any person deposit</text>
  <text start="581.44" dur="7.259">depositing or withdrawing cash which is</text>
  <text start="585.069" dur="6.75">over $10,000 now in the US there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="588.699" dur="5.58">same exact laws under title 31 section</text>
  <text start="591.819" dur="5.161">five three to four and there is</text>
  <text start="594.279" dur="6.451">something called structuring they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="596.98" dur="6.109">keeping track of any individual who</text>
  <text start="600.73" dur="4.2">takes out less than ten thousand</text>
  <text start="603.089" dur="3.67">multiple times in a row</text>
  <text start="604.93" dur="3.719">so let&amp;#39;s say you have five thousand</text>
  <text start="606.759" dur="4.02">dollars and you decided to take five</text>
  <text start="608.649" dur="2.641">thousand out today five thousand out</text>
  <text start="610.779" dur="3.18">tomorrow</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="5.64">five thousand out the next day that in</text>
  <text start="613.959" dur="5.49">itself is a crime which they call</text>
  <text start="616.93" dur="5.37">structuring which is the practice of</text>
  <text start="619.449" dur="5.64">executing financial transactions such as</text>
  <text start="622.3" dur="5.31">making bank to pot deposits in specific</text>
  <text start="625.089" dur="4.86">patterns calculated to avoid triggering</text>
  <text start="627.61" dur="5.43">financial institutions to file reports</text>
  <text start="629.949" dur="5.07">requiring by law now under the US Bank</text>
  <text start="633.04" dur="6.659">Secrecy Act and the Internal Revenue</text>
  <text start="635.019" dur="7.17">Code sixty fifty I form 8300 structuring</text>
  <text start="639.699" dur="4.651">is a pattern of avoiding taxes they call</text>
  <text start="642.189" dur="4.231">money-laundering which they pretend is</text>
  <text start="644.35" dur="5.789">now to protect us against terrorists</text>
  <text start="646.42" dur="6.839">when in fact 99.9 percent is all about</text>
  <text start="650.139" dur="7.2">tax revenue and it&amp;#39;s all about keeping</text>
  <text start="653.259" dur="5.961">track of who is doing what and the</text>
  <text start="657.339" dur="4.8">penalty is up to five years in prison</text>
  <text start="659.22" dur="5.44">now if this was over a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="662.139" dur="4.771">the penalties up to ten years in prison</text>
  <text start="664.66" dur="5.279">under title 31 section five thirty two</text>
  <text start="666.91" dur="4.549">four and they do not need to prove that</text>
  <text start="669.939" dur="5.25">the money is part of any other crime</text>
  <text start="671.459" dur="6.61">merely trying to avoid reporting by</text>
  <text start="675.189" dur="5.671">structuring transactions is the crime</text>
