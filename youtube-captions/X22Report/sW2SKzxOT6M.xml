  <text start="275.02" dur="6.18">hasn&amp;#39;t happened yet it was all talk it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.32" dur="5.04">still talk I know it&amp;#39;s only what eleven</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="4.77">twelve days since Trump has been in</text>
  <text start="283.36" dur="4.86">office but again the economy has not</text>
  <text start="285.97" dur="5.19">changed actually it has changed things</text>

  <text start="291.16" dur="5.52">are closing housing is declining things</text>
  <text start="295" dur="3.66">are rapidly deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="296.68" dur="5.67">quickly the only thing that&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="298.66" dur="6.39">is the stock market which is still</text>
  <text start="302.35" dur="3.93">completely manipulated with the plunge</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="3.15">protection team the high-frequency</text>
  <text start="306.28" dur="6.75">traders the free money coming from the</text>
  <text start="308.2" dur="7.77">central bank remember Trump is still</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="6.06">in charge the central bank&amp;#39;s the deep</text>
  <text start="315.97" dur="4.95">state they are in charge they are</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="3.09">controlling everything that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="320.92" dur="3.66">the only thing that Trump is doing right</text>
  <text start="322.18" dur="5.19">now was reversing pretty much everything</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="5.55">that Obama did through executive orders</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="4.5">Obama created all these executive orders</text>
  <text start="330.13" dur="4.35">and Trump is just reversing everything</text>
  <text start="331.87" dur="4.86">he did so Trump hasn&amp;#39;t really gone after</text>
  <text start="334.48" dur="5.85">the central bank he hasn&amp;#39;t really gone</text>
  <text start="336.73" dur="5.73">after the elite he hasn&amp;#39;t made any of</text>
  <text start="340.33" dur="4.62">those type of moves so right now they</text>
  <text start="342.46" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t care all these little type of</text>
  <text start="344.95" dur="3.51">executive orders that he&amp;#39;s doing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="5.43">meaningless to them and they&amp;#39;re still in</text>
  <text start="348.46" dur="6.99">charge but what we are seeing is that</text>
  <text start="351.61" dur="8.58">the Affordable Care Act well that did</text>
  <text start="355.45" dur="8.46">have a negative effect on jobs because</text>
  <text start="360.19" dur="6.48">the manufacturing CEO told lawmakers on</text>
  <text start="363.91" dur="5.88">Wednesday that costs imposed by the</text>
  <text start="366.67" dur="6.24">Affordable Care Act negatively impacted</text>
  <text start="369.79" dur="5.94">his company to the ability to hire new</text>
  <text start="372.91" dur="5.85">workers make capital investments and</text>
  <text start="375.73" dur="6.06">develop new products Joe Eddie president</text>
  <text start="378.76" dur="4.74">and CEO of Eagle manufacturing he was</text>
  <text start="381.79" dur="4.5">testifying before the House Committee of</text>
  <text start="383.5" dur="3.81">education and the workforce on behalf of</text>
  <text start="386.29" dur="3.42">the National Association of</text>
  <text start="387.31" dur="4.13">Manufacturers and he&amp;#39;s saying and this</text>
  <text start="389.71" dur="4.74">represents about 12 million Americans</text>
  <text start="391.44" dur="6.07">saying yes because of the Affordable</text>
  <text start="394.45" dur="8.04">Care Act they were not hiring</text>
  <text start="397.51" dur="6.78">individuals because the cost continually</text>
  <text start="402.49" dur="4.71">moved up and when he was saying is that</text>
  <text start="404.29" dur="4.2">he before the Affordable Care Act he</text>
  <text start="407.2" dur="5.49">paid for health insurance for his</text>
  <text start="408.49" dur="7.89">employees in 2009 he bade about 13,500</text>
  <text start="412.69" dur="7.11">per employee for health insurance and he</text>
  <text start="416.38" dur="7.05">said today its twenty two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="7.56">hundred per employee an increase of 9300</text>
  <text start="423.43" dur="8.28">and because of taxes paperwork cheese</text>
  <text start="427.36" dur="6.33">mandates you know this put a huge burden</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="4.26">on his company this is why he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="433.69" dur="3.72">hiring more people this is why he was</text>
  <text start="435.97" dur="5.01">keeping the number of people very low</text>
  <text start="437.41" dur="5.55">because it was very difficult to pay for</text>
  <text start="440.98" dur="5.46">the insurance now other companies where</text>
  <text start="442.96" dur="5.19">they have lower cost employees the</text>
  <text start="446.44" dur="3.63">Bergen came off the corporations and</text>
  <text start="448.15" dur="3.95">went on to each individual where they</text>
  <text start="450.07" dur="4.86">got subsidized but the middle management</text>
  <text start="452.1" dur="5.2">where they&amp;#39;re making me up 40 50 60</text>
  <text start="454.93" dur="5.28">thousand dollars well they were caught</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="5.73">up and they had to pay Obama care for</text>
  <text start="460.21" dur="4.26">themselves which was very high to do and</text>
  <text start="463.03" dur="4.02">a lot of the companies were saying okay</text>
  <text start="464.47" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;ll go and have these with you to help</text>
  <text start="467.05" dur="5.28">you out but we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="469.9" dur="6.69">those companies that completely pay</text>
  <text start="472.33" dur="8.25">fully for their employee benefits well</text>
  <text start="476.59" dur="6.51">this was a huge problem for them now</text>
  <text start="480.58" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re seeing mortgage applications well</text>
  <text start="483.1" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re declining we had a little pop-up</text>
  <text start="485.17" dur="4.44">of gains but now they declined by</text>
  <text start="487.57" dur="4.23">three-point-two percent from a week</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="4.47">earlier and this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="491.8" dur="5.61">Mortgage Bankers Association weekly</text>
  <text start="494.08" dur="6.15">mortgage application survey and what</text>
  <text start="497.41" dur="6">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the total</text>
  <text start="500.23" dur="5.22">applications decreased to 12.1 percent</text>
  <text start="503.41" dur="6.54">from thirteen point six percent there</text>
  <text start="505.45" dur="7.469">week prior and it completely imploded on</text>
  <text start="509.95" dur="5.969">itself and while the mortgage</text>
  <text start="512.919" dur="5.761">applications are declining of course we</text>
  <text start="515.919" dur="4.171">see according to case-shiller housing</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="3.45">prices are increasing but if you look</text>
  <text start="520.09" dur="4.89">outside those 20 cities you don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="522.13" dur="5.31">the same exact story but we also see us</text>
  <text start="524.98" dur="5.91">construction activity well it completely</text>
  <text start="527.44" dur="6.21">declined in December we see it dipped by</text>
  <text start="530.89" dur="5.31">point two percent in December and the</text>
  <text start="533.65" dur="4.59">reason for this it is because there was</text>
  <text start="536.2" dur="6.3">a drop in government project so</text>
  <text start="538.24" dur="9.17">government projects increased us</text>
  <text start="542.5" dur="7.77">construction activity another illusion</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="5.62">it wasn&amp;#39;t the private sector it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="550.27" dur="4.68">these builders who are building homes it</text>
  <text start="553.03" dur="3.78">was the government once again just like</text>
  <text start="554.95" dur="4.53">the government comes in and purchases</text>
  <text start="556.81" dur="6.18">vehicles they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="559.48" dur="8.06">manipulate it very easily now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.99" dur="7.5">seeing the US economy it is flashing</text>
  <text start="567.54" dur="5.26">another major warning sign that a</text>
  <text start="570.49" dur="5.88">depression is coming out yesterday we</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="7.26">talked about the chicago PMI which came</text>
  <text start="576.37" dur="7.92">in at 50.3 a 50 equals Stan</text>
  <text start="580.06" dur="6.69">and the beginning of a recession going</text>
  <text start="584.29" dur="3.78">into a depression we&amp;#39;re already in a</text>
  <text start="586.75" dur="5.67">recession we&amp;#39;re heading towards a</text>
  <text start="588.07" dur="7.61">depression now the PMI and of itself is</text>
  <text start="592.42" dur="8.19">bad news but new orders component that</text>
  <text start="595.68" dur="7.45">came in at 49.1 and this is well deep</text>
  <text start="600.61" dur="5.31">into recessionary recession territory</text>
  <text start="603.13" dur="6.09">heading into a depression now let&amp;#39;s add</text>
  <text start="605.92" dur="5.85">the worst part price paid what</text>
  <text start="609.22" dur="6.66">manufacturers are having to pay for the</text>
  <text start="611.77" dur="7.5">items scored a 61.4 so you&amp;#39;ve got growth</text>
  <text start="615.88" dur="7.2">collapsing and prices soared this is</text>
  <text start="619.27" dur="5.4">stagflation now stocks are acting like</text>
  <text start="623.08" dur="4.22">everything is fantastic everything is</text>
  <text start="624.67" dur="8.07">great but the real data is showing us a</text>
  <text start="627.3" dur="11.38">depression is coming it&amp;#39;s already upon</text>
  <text start="632.74" dur="9.11">us coupled with higher inflation 2016</text>
  <text start="638.68" dur="6.51">GDP growth was the worst since 2011</text>
  <text start="641.85" dur="8.8">while inflation expectations have shot</text>
  <text start="645.19" dur="8.31">higher now those individuals who believe</text>
  <text start="650.65" dur="5.19">that GDP is going to grow by five</text>
  <text start="653.5" dur="5.1">percent this year and then next year</text>
  <text start="655.84" dur="5.85">well you can see at this point this is</text>
  <text start="658.6" dur="5.46">not going to happen the IMF the US have</text>
  <text start="661.69" dur="5.34">been saying this for years and years and</text>
  <text start="664.06" dur="4.14">years that have gone by since 2008 where</text>
  <text start="667.03" dur="4.82">they say we&amp;#39;re going to hit three point</text>
  <text start="668.2" dur="6.69">five percent and throughout Obama&amp;#39;s term</text>
  <text start="671.85" dur="5.14">not even close not even anywhere close</text>
  <text start="674.89" dur="4.11">and we know the numbers that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="676.99" dur="5.28">reporting they have been completely</text>
  <text start="679" dur="6.12">manipulated the reason why GDP mostly is</text>
  <text start="682.27" dur="6.75">going up is Obamacare the premiums are</text>
  <text start="685.12" dur="9.27">rising so quickly that it pushes GDP up</text>
  <text start="689.02" dur="7.14">because spending is a huge part of GDP</text>
  <text start="694.39" dur="5.1">here in the United States and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="696.16" dur="6.54">because people spending in retail so we</text>
  <text start="699.49" dur="6.24">can see if we strip all that out GDP is</text>
  <text start="702.7" dur="6.81">at negative point 1 negative point 2</text>
  <text start="705.73" dur="7.17">percent so how in the world are we going</text>
  <text start="709.51" dur="6.58">to hit five percent this year</text>
  <text start="712.9" dur="6.94">ridiculous now the IMF came out with a</text>
  <text start="716.09" dur="6.03">new study and they&amp;#39;re looking at the EU</text>
  <text start="719.84" dur="4.44">countries and what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="722.12" dur="4.58">that the EU countries well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="724.28" dur="4.65">running into excessive deficits</text>
  <text start="726.7" dur="4.42">distorted budgets and poor compliance</text>
  <text start="728.93" dur="6.3">with financial rules in the single</text>
  <text start="731.12" dur="6.09">currency area and the working paper is</text>
  <text start="735.23" dur="4.95">called fiscal politics in the euro area</text>
  <text start="737.21" dur="5.25">and it analyzes data from 19 different</text>
  <text start="740.18" dur="5.61">countries that participated in the</text>
  <text start="742.46" dur="7.08">eurozone from 1999 2015 this is what it</text>
  <text start="745.79" dur="6.12">reveals public debt to GDP ratio of the</text>
  <text start="749.54" dur="4.29">euro area as a whole increased from an</text>
