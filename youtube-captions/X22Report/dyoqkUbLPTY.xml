  <text start="188.38" dur="4.8">right now that they&amp;#39;re making this push</text>
  <text start="191.02" dur="4.56">now a lot of the city&amp;#39;s well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="193.18" dur="5.52">going to go along with what Jeff session</text>
  <text start="195.58" dur="4.56">is proposing here and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="198.7" dur="3.33">pushing back and a lot of the cities</text>
  <text start="200.14" dur="6.51">have been pushing back now the whole</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="7.32">fiasco with new neighs and the spying</text>
  <text start="206.65" dur="5.31">and everything that&amp;#39;s going on well it</text>
  <text start="209.35" dur="6.63">has just hit another level right now</text>
  <text start="211.96" dur="6.12">Schiff well he wants chairman Nunez to</text>
  <text start="215.98" dur="4.95">recuse himself from the Trump Russia</text>
  <text start="218.08" dur="5.55">probe because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re afraid of the information that</text>
  <text start="223.63" dur="4.8">he has remember the deep state right now</text>
  <text start="226.24" dur="4.38">is looking at this entire situation and</text>
  <text start="228.43" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re scratching their heads they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.62" dur="7.29">wondering what exactly does Nunez have</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="5.97">what exactly does Trump know and how are</text>
  <text start="237.91" dur="5.52">they going to proceed because right now</text>
  <text start="240.37" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re very nervous and they want</text>
  <text start="243.43" dur="5.73">devyn units basically out of the picture</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="4.62">and they want to regain control of what</text>
  <text start="249.16" dur="4.44">is going on here because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="250.9" dur="4.47">most afraid of right now is that this</text>
  <text start="253.6" dur="4.74">whole thing is going to be blown wide</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="4.92">open and a gigantic truth bomb is going</text>
  <text start="258.34" dur="3.75">to come out of this and we can see right</text>
  <text start="260.29" dur="5.49">now that Nunez is saying absolutely not</text>
  <text start="262.09" dur="6.21">I am NOT stepping aside from the</text>
  <text start="265.78" dur="4.91">investigation at all he says why would I</text>
  <text start="268.3" dur="4.41">the calls for him to resign came after</text>
  <text start="270.69" dur="3.82">revelations about his meeting with a</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="4.44">secret source on White House grounds</text>
  <text start="274.51" dur="5.16">raised questions about his and the</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="4.77">panel&amp;#39;s independence noon a said the</text>
  <text start="279.67" dur="5.4">pressure for him to resign is typical</text>
  <text start="281.92" dur="7.47">politics and he&amp;#39;s not playing along trey</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="7.62">Gowdy came in and he said well if the</text>
  <text start="289.39" dur="6.54">Intel committee chairman can&amp;#39;t brief the</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="6.06">president we&amp;#39;re in s very strange place</text>
  <text start="295.93" dur="5.46">and we can see right now that Gowdy is</text>
  <text start="298.75" dur="5.85">saying first of all who is Schiff who is</text>
  <text start="301.39" dur="5.43">Schumer to call on Nunez to step aside</text>
  <text start="304.6" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re not going to do anything they tell</text>
  <text start="306.82" dur="5.849">us to do we&amp;#39;re not going to just do it</text>
  <text start="309.85" dur="5.22">because they want us to do it and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.669" dur="5.041">absolutely right because for</text>
  <text start="315.07" dur="5.34">them to push so hard for them to</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="4.47">continually be out there and for them to</text>
  <text start="320.41" dur="3.27">continually say we need these</text>
  <text start="322.18" dur="3.96">individuals to could recuse themselves</text>
  <text start="323.68" dur="4.98">we need to know the source who is it</text>
  <text start="326.14" dur="5.67">where what do they have they are nervous</text>
  <text start="328.66" dur="5.82">right now they&amp;#39;re afraid of this</text>
  <text start="331.81" dur="5.4">information that might be spilled out</text>
  <text start="334.48" dur="5.25">into the public realm and the public</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="5.13">looks at it and says just a minute here</text>
  <text start="339.73" dur="4.62">are you to tell me that these</text>
  <text start="342.34" dur="5.55">individuals in the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="344.35" dur="6.33">have been spying on Trump and many other</text>
  <text start="347.89" dur="5.76">individuals and they went ahead and</text>
  <text start="350.68" dur="6.42">broke the law and unmasked certain</text>
  <text start="353.65" dur="7.11">individuals and they&amp;#39;re trying to regain</text>
  <text start="357.1" dur="6.63">control of this whole scenario and</text>
  <text start="360.76" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re very nervous now and this is why</text>
  <text start="363.73" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re pushing so hard to find out who</text>
  <text start="366.28" dur="4.74">the leaker is actually it&amp;#39;s not even a</text>
  <text start="368.65" dur="5.25">leaker it&amp;#39;s an actual source there they</text>
  <text start="371.02" dur="5.1">want Nunez to recuse himself and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="373.9" dur="4.14">really pushing this very hard Trump is</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="3.96">out there and he took the Twitter saying</text>
  <text start="378.04" dur="4.37">that actually the congressional</text>
  <text start="380.08" dur="5.73">lawmakers they should be looking into</text>
  <text start="382.41" dur="5.71">Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="385.81" dur="4.77">what ties they have to Russia and he</text>
  <text start="388.12" dur="4.2">tweeted out why isn&amp;#39;t the House</text>
  <text start="390.58" dur="3.51">Intelligence Committee looking into the</text>
  <text start="392.32" dur="4.26">Bill and Hillary deal that allowed big</text>
  <text start="394.09" dur="6.18">uranium to go to Russia Russian speech</text>
  <text start="396.58" dur="6.84">which was then followed by money to bill</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="5.94">the Hillary Russian reset praise of</text>
  <text start="403.42" dur="4.59">Russia by Hillary or Podesta Russian</text>
  <text start="406.21" dur="5.07">company and he&amp;#39;s absolutely right</text>
  <text start="408.01" dur="5.67">because we can see that then Secretary</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="4.38">of State Clinton well she allowed big</text>
  <text start="413.68" dur="3.54">uranium to go to Russia and Bill</text>
  <text start="415.66" dur="3.75">Clinton&amp;#39;s high dollar Russian speech</text>
  <text start="417.22" dur="4.11">where allegations first reported by the</text>

  <text start="431.29" dur="5.07">Times and Dean accurate by establishment</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="4.73">media media reveal how Clinton&amp;#39;s tenure</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="4.47">as Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="438.39" dur="4.84">coincided with the influx of tens of</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="4.11">millions of dollars from foreign sources</text>
  <text start="443.23" dur="3.93">into the Clinton Foundation which</text>
  <text start="444.94" dur="3.37">resulted in favorable actions for</text>
  <text start="447.16" dur="3.73">Russian government</text>
  <text start="448.31" dur="4.8">indeed the Clinton Foundation had</text>
  <text start="450.89" dur="5.51">received millions in donations from</text>
  <text start="453.11" dur="5.19">several investors in uranium one a</text>
  <text start="456.4" dur="4">canadian-based company in which a</text>
  <text start="458.3" dur="5.25">majority stake was sold to Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.4" dur="4.89">nuclear energy agency Rosset um and a</text>
  <text start="463.55" dur="3.9">lucrative deal needing approval from</text>
  <text start="465.29" dur="4.71">Clinton&amp;#39;s State Department and eight</text>
  <text start="467.45" dur="4.98">other federal agencies the sale gave the</text>
  <text start="470" dur="4.89">Russians control of one fifth of all</text>
  <text start="472.43" dur="4.41">uranium production capacity in the</text>
  <text start="474.89" dur="5.4">United States the New York Times</text>
  <text start="476.84" dur="6.15">confirmed this the deal as Trump points</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="4.92">out refers to how donations to the</text>
  <text start="482.99" dur="4.47">Clinton Foundation from executives of</text>
  <text start="485.21" dur="4.8">Russian owned uranium one had exceeded</text>
  <text start="487.46" dur="4.95">one hundred and forty five million</text>
  <text start="490.01" dur="4.98">dollars again according to the New York</text>
  <text start="492.41" dur="5.04">Times in fact those Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="5.28">donations from uranium investors spiked</text>
  <text start="497.45" dur="5.49">just as the deal for Russia&amp;#39;s Raza Tom</text>
  <text start="500.27" dur="5.22">to secure uranium one was being</text>
  <text start="502.94" dur="4.95">finalized and we can see there is</text>
  <text start="505.49" dur="5.12">evidence there there&amp;#39;s something to look</text>
  <text start="507.89" dur="5.28">into but again nothing is being done</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="5.71">nothing is being done for those</text>
  <text start="513.17" dur="5.43">individuals that unmasked Flynn where</text>
  <text start="516.32" dur="4.8">the crime was committed but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="518.6" dur="4.68">looking into the connection between</text>
  <text start="521.12" dur="4.38">Trump and Russia where every single</text>
  <text start="523.28" dur="4.8">person says there is no connection so</text>
  <text start="525.5" dur="4.44">you can see how this is all slanted now</text>
  <text start="528.08" dur="4.05">Trump today signed the energy</text>
  <text start="529.94" dur="4.32">independence which completely killed</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="3.51">Obama&amp;#39;s climate change initiative and we</text>
  <text start="534.26" dur="3.48">can see that this was one of his</text>
  <text start="535.64" dur="3.78">promises during his campaign now there</text>
  <text start="537.74" dur="4.56">are individuals out there saying that</text>
  <text start="539.42" dur="5.73">well Trump is putting on a show he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.3" dur="5.25">really part of the system and this is</text>
  <text start="545.15" dur="4.53">just one gigantic show that he&amp;#39;s putting</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="5.31">on for the entire country and the</text>
  <text start="549.68" dur="4.98">central bankers the deep state well they</text>
  <text start="552.86" dur="4.08">have complete control of all of this and</text>
  <text start="554.66" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re all being fooled on being fooled</text>
  <text start="556.94" dur="7.56">if that is the case then there&amp;#39;d be no</text>
  <text start="560.09" dur="8.04">reason whatsoever to push this hard to</text>
  <text start="564.5" dur="6.12">try to connect him to Russia the push</text>
  <text start="568.13" dur="4.74">wouldn&amp;#39;t be so hard to try to get him</text>
  <text start="570.62" dur="5.82">out of office the push wouldn&amp;#39;t be so</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="5.88">hard to stop him from being elected</text>
  <text start="576.44" dur="3.96">because if is really part of the system</text>
  <text start="578.75" dur="3.33">and this was part of what they really</text>
  <text start="580.4" dur="3.84">wanted just like Obama</text>
  <text start="582.08" dur="4.02">just like the bushes just like going all</text>
  <text start="584.24" dur="5.46">the way back you wouldn&amp;#39;t need a show</text>
  <text start="586.1" dur="5.76">they would continue on with what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="589.7" dur="4.41">doing here and actually if they were</text>
  <text start="591.86" dur="4.26">really in control they would have</text>
  <text start="594.11" dur="5.22">Clinton in office right now like they</text>
  <text start="596.12" dur="6.21">planned do I think he&amp;#39;s doing what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.33" dur="5.01">past what what he can do yes do I think</text>
  <text start="602.33" dur="4.08">all of his actions are working in the</text>
  <text start="604.34" dur="4.68">best interests of the people not really</text>
  <text start="606.41" dur="5.85">because he&amp;#39;s brought on many individuals</text>
  <text start="609.02" dur="6.81">that I do not agree with and we can see</text>
  <text start="612.26" dur="7.29">that yes he might be you know persuaded</text>
  <text start="615.83" dur="6.75">to do other things and again we still</text>
  <text start="619.55" dur="4.86">have to wait to see what he does now out</text>
  <text start="622.58" dur="3.12">in the Middle East that is a completely</text>
  <text start="624.41" dur="3.69">completely different story</text>
  <text start="625.7" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s like he&amp;#39;s hands off of what is</text>
  <text start="628.1" dur="2.85">going on in the Middle East and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="629.48" dur="4.5">handed that over to the deep State</text>
  <text start="630.95" dur="4.74">because they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="633.98" dur="3.33">doing out there and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="635.69" dur="3.66">meet their agenda they&amp;#39;re trying to go</text>
  <text start="637.31" dur="3.75">for their goal and it looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="639.35" dur="4.23">really not getting involved in that and</text>
  <text start="641.06" dur="4.95">I know he&amp;#39;s trying to push you know</text>
  <text start="643.58" dur="5.49">manufacturing back here he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="646.01" dur="5.7">push jobs back here but again without</text>
  <text start="649.07" dur="4.89">tackling the real issues and that is the</text>
  <text start="651.71" dur="3.69">central bank and if he doesn&amp;#39;t go after</text>
  <text start="653.96" dur="3.87">the central bank I know he hang the</text>
  <text start="655.4" dur="4.62">portrait up Andrew Jackson it is a</text>

  <text start="685.94" dur="4.56">right now we will have to wait and see</text>

  <text start="734.12" dur="4.17">this could be viewed as an act of war we</text>
  <text start="736.58" dur="5.85">should really go to war over this</text>
  <text start="738.29" dur="7.8">I mean look how these neocons look how</text>
  <text start="742.43" dur="7.83">badly they want war he comes out of</text>

  <text start="756.2" dur="7.38">Congress about sending Americans to die</text>
  <text start="760.16" dur="5.76">in undeclared Wars today he said on the</text>
  <text start="763.58" dur="4.71">Senate floor and he did this most likely</text>
  <text start="765.92" dur="4.98">to shame his colleagues about not</text>
  <text start="768.29" dur="5.43">debating and voting for war before</text>

  <text start="775.01" dur="4.32">he said nobody wanted this debate he</text>
  <text start="776.96" dur="5.73">said they wanted just a rubber stamp it</text>
  <text start="779.33" dur="6.23">and they want to send all the young kids</text>
  <text start="782.69" dur="6.18">to war with no debate which is</text>
  <text start="785.56" dur="6.55">ridiculous because Congress declares war</text>
  <text start="788.87" dur="5.55">and Congress should have stood up and</text>
  <text start="792.11" dur="4.35">said we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute why are we</text>
  <text start="794.42" dur="3.99">going out to all of these countries what</text>
  <text start="796.46" dur="4.11">is the purpose they never attacked the</text>
  <text start="798.41" dur="3.93">United States what is the real reason</text>
  <text start="800.57" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re going out there let&amp;#39;s have a</text>
  <text start="802.34" dur="4.8">debate and he&amp;#39;s absolutely right and I</text>
  <text start="804.74" dur="5.49">agree with him now today the US Senate</text>
  <text start="807.14" dur="5.58">advances approval for Montenegro to join</text>
  <text start="810.23" dur="4.53">NATO we understand that when McCain was</text>
  <text start="812.72" dur="4.08">on the floor and he said anyone who</text>
  <text start="814.76" dur="3.48">objects for a Montenegro to becoming</text>
  <text start="816.8" dur="3.9">part of NATO</text>
  <text start="818.24" dur="5.16">well those individuals are working for</text>
  <text start="820.7" dur="4.08">Russia working for Vladimir Putin and of</text>
  <text start="823.4" dur="2.04">course Rand Paul stood up and said I</text>
  <text start="824.78" dur="2.7">object</text>
  <text start="825.44" dur="4.26">and of course McCain says well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="827.48" dur="4.44">working for Putin but we can see right</text>
  <text start="829.7" dur="4.56">now the US Senate that well they voted</text>
  <text start="831.92" dur="5.61">overwhelmingly to advance the approval</text>
  <text start="834.26" dur="6.6">they wanted part of NATO and again this</text>
  <text start="837.53" dur="5.91">is another push to provoke Russia this</text>
  <text start="840.86" dur="5.64">is what they want these neocons want to</text>
  <text start="843.44" dur="4.86">continually provoke Russia and they in</text>
  <text start="846.5" dur="3.3">their minds they really do believe that</text>
  <text start="848.3" dur="4.62">Russia is going to</text>
  <text start="849.8" dur="6.06">tack any minute that Russia is the enemy</text>
  <text start="852.92" dur="5.46">the only reason it is considered the</text>
  <text start="855.86" dur="4.349">enemy is because Putin took control of</text>
  <text start="858.38" dur="3.57">the central bank and the private western</text>
  <text start="860.209" dur="4.531">central bankers do not control it</text>

  <text start="918.41" dur="5.73">all as one because that&amp;#39;s how it fits</text>
  <text start="921.26" dur="4.769">into their model now we can see the</text>

  <text start="968.81" dur="7.26">beautiful sights and the waterways it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="972.82" dur="6.4">basically to keep control of those</text>
  <text start="976.07" dur="5.55">oil-producing countries if there was no</text>
  <text start="979.22" dur="3.99">oil there the United States wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="981.62" dur="4.38">even be there</text>
  <text start="983.21" dur="5.82">we see Libya&amp;#39;s half Darwell he refused</text>
  <text start="986" dur="6.78">an invite to Tunisia and he is saying</text>
  <text start="989.03" dur="6.51">that the Tunisian government while</text>

  <text start="1011.17" dur="3.57">rapidly changing in Libya and this is</text>
  <text start="1012.55" dur="5.37">why the u.s. is never gonna leave Libya</text>
  <text start="1014.74" dur="6.63">and they&amp;#39;re preparing to strike in Libya</text>
  <text start="1017.92" dur="6.9">once again we see the watchdog well it</text>
  <text start="1021.37" dur="6.48">has slammed the us-led coalition for the</text>
  <text start="1024.82" dur="4.5">bombing in Mossel we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1027.85" dur="4.83">looking into it and they&amp;#39;re gathering</text>
  <text start="1029.32" dur="5.28">evidence in East muscle and it points to</text>
  <text start="1032.68" dur="5.01">an alarming pattern of us-led coalition</text>
  <text start="1034.6" dur="5.57">airstrikes which have destroyed whole</text>
  <text start="1037.69" dur="5.01">houses with entire families inside and</text>
  <text start="1040.17" dur="5.65">they&amp;#39;re looking into this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1042.7" dur="6.08">saying this is just unbelievable and</text>
  <text start="1045.82" dur="5.79">this is a pattern we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="1048.78" dur="4.15">Iran is out there they are saying and</text>
  <text start="1051.61" dur="4.47">this is coming from the Iranian Foreign</text>
  <text start="1052.93" dur="4.7">Minister saying that yes Russia can use</text>
  <text start="1056.08" dur="7.35">its military bases on a case-by-case</text>
  <text start="1057.63" dur="7.57">basis to defend Assad in Syria and we</text>
  <text start="1063.43" dur="4.44">can see right now that Russian jets have</text>
  <text start="1065.2" dur="5.16">used the airbase and Iran to strike</text>
  <text start="1067.87" dur="4.47">different targets in Syria and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1070.36" dur="5.22">be doing this as we move forward here</text>
  <text start="1072.34" dur="7.56">now the United States and the coalition</text>
  <text start="1075.58" dur="7.14">forces they are preparing most likely to</text>
  <text start="1079.9" dur="5.43">balkanize Syria we see that the</text>
  <text start="1082.72" dur="4.65">coalition well they destroyed four</text>
  <text start="1085.33" dur="4.95">bridges two in Raqqa and two in the</text>
  <text start="1087.37" dur="6.27">settlements of El Corte and Al abara</text>
  <text start="1090.28" dur="4.68">and as a result of these actions we see</text>
  <text start="1093.64" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s about two hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="1094.96" dur="4.92">inhabitants and they&amp;#39;re kind of stuck</text>
  <text start="1098.14" dur="5.25">they don&amp;#39;t know where to go right now</text>
  <text start="1099.88" dur="5.67">and we see that Russia is looking at the</text>
  <text start="1103.39" dur="4.83">situation and they&amp;#39;re saying that these</text>
  <text start="1105.55" dur="5.52">strikes make no sense whatsoever in what</text>
  <text start="1108.22" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re doing and when they look at the</text>
  <text start="1111.07" dur="5.229">situation they&amp;#39;re saying the only reason</text>
  <text start="1113.29" dur="6.129">to do this is to separate Syria</text>
  <text start="1116.299" dur="5.781">very interesting because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1119.419" dur="5.1">happening now they are destroying</text>

  <text start="1172.219" dur="5.221">quietly doing this why do you think they</text>
  <text start="1174.889" dur="4.681">set up the bases in all these areas why</text>
  <text start="1177.44" dur="4.549">do you think they brought troops in why</text>
  <text start="1179.57" dur="5.819">do you think there&amp;#39;s a new talk about</text>
  <text start="1181.989" dur="5.62">safe zones or stabilization zones</text>
  <text start="1185.389" dur="4.44">because what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
