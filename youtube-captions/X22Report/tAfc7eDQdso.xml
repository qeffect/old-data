  <text start="355.479" dur="4.201">and over about lowering the rates about</text>
  <text start="358.03" dur="5.939">how they don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="359.68" dur="7.44">they&amp;#39;re worse for the u.s. then China</text>
  <text start="363.969" dur="4.831">they&amp;#39;re a bigger problem and the</text>

  <text start="480.599" dur="6.06">all knew this and this is why they did</text>
  <text start="483.3" dur="6.569">an about-face because the central bank</text>
  <text start="486.659" dur="7.16">never wants to be in the spotlight they</text>
  <text start="489.869" dur="8.01">want to be behind the curtain so Trump</text>
  <text start="493.819" dur="6.7">he decided to meet with Federal Reserve</text>

  <text start="543.509" dur="6.361">interest rates and negative rates now</text>
  <text start="547.56" dur="5.129">didn&amp;#39;t the Fed just say that they</text>
  <text start="549.87" dur="4.92">weren&amp;#39;t gonna lower rates anymore then</text>
  <text start="552.689" dur="4.26">they say it&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a freeze on it</text>
  <text start="554.79" dur="3.779">now this is what the bad guys want the</text>
  <text start="556.949" dur="2.021">bad guys within the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="558.569" dur="2.741">system</text>

  <text start="561.31" dur="7.98">anymore they don&amp;#39;t want to go where the</text>
  <text start="565" dur="7.23">EU has gone because they know if Trump</text>
  <text start="569.29" dur="6">continually lowers the rates and adds</text>
  <text start="572.23" dur="7.02">more stimulus what happens to the stock</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="7.2">market what happens to unemployment what</text>
  <text start="579.25" dur="6.12">happens to GDP and if you throw in tax</text>
  <text start="582.49" dur="6.66">cuts and everything else statistically</text>
  <text start="585.37" dur="7.44">the economy is going to look amazing now</text>
  <text start="589.15" dur="6.78">by meeting with Fed chair Jerome Powell</text>
  <text start="592.81" dur="6.6">and Trump saying this was a very nice</text>
  <text start="595.93" dur="5.94">cordial meeting he just countered the</text>
  <text start="599.41" dur="4.8">mainstream media where they said oh look</text>
  <text start="601.87" dur="4.89">Trump is going to fire Jerome Powell</text>
  <text start="604.21" dur="4.41">he&amp;#39;s been tweeting out against him he</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="4.77">doesn&amp;#39;t like him he wants to get rid of</text>
  <text start="608.62" dur="5.61">him and here Trump is meeting with the</text>
  <text start="611.53" dur="4.59">Fed and everything that they talked</text>
  <text start="614.23" dur="6.93">about has just been thrown out the</text>
  <text start="616.12" dur="7.92">window why do you think Trump was</text>
  <text start="621.16" dur="5.37">meeting with Jerome Powell one to</text>
  <text start="624.04" dur="6.24">counter the mainstream media to show</text>
  <text start="626.53" dur="7.02">that they were completely wrong - it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="630.28" dur="7.56">the second part of the plan I do believe</text>
  <text start="633.55" dur="6.57">that Powell in some way somehow is part</text>
  <text start="637.84" dur="5.67">of all of this he might even be a good</text>
  <text start="640.12" dur="5.07">guy within the central bank system and I</text>
  <text start="643.51" dur="5.52">do believe they were discussing all this</text>
  <text start="645.19" dur="5.52">to see where they were going now to make</text>
  <text start="649.03" dur="3.93">it look really good</text>
  <text start="650.71" dur="5.61">remember optics are very important the</text>
  <text start="652.96" dur="5.7">Fed has to look independent you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="656.32" dur="6.12">to see a push and a pull you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="658.66" dur="6.84">see Trump try to push the Fed and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="662.44" dur="6.149">gonna see Jerome Powell he&amp;#39;s gonna push</text>
  <text start="665.5" dur="6.14">back he&amp;#39;s gonna sell it no we have to</text>
  <text start="668.589" dur="5.301">hold the rate steady right now other</text>
  <text start="671.64" dur="4.78">central bankers are gonna agree with</text>
  <text start="673.89" dur="4.96">Jerome Powell saying yeah we should not</text>
  <text start="676.42" dur="3.93">raise rates at this moment we should not</text>
  <text start="678.85" dur="4.23">cut rates we should just leave them</text>
  <text start="680.35" dur="5.1">where they are right now this is going</text>
  <text start="683.08" dur="7.05">to be done on purpose to show that the</text>
  <text start="685.45" dur="6.379">Fed is still independent and once the</text>
  <text start="690.13" dur="4.499">time is right</text>
