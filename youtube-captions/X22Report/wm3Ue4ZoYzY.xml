  <text start="58.37" dur="6.78">is episode 1634 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.3" dur="5.94">August 9th 2018 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="65.15" dur="7.109">episode is Rothschild just revealed the</text>
  <text start="68.24" dur="6.81">plan and placed the blame let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="72.259" dur="5.911">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="75.05" dur="5.099">as we know the government companies they</text>
  <text start="78.17" dur="4.71">like to change statistics or leave</text>
  <text start="80.149" dur="5.58">things out if things aren&amp;#39;t going their</text>
  <text start="82.88" dur="5.43">way and when we start to look at used</text>
  <text start="85.729" dur="4.471">cars when we look at new cars and we</text>
  <text start="88.31" dur="4.14">start to look at the entire thing we</text>
  <text start="90.2" dur="4.11">start to realize that things aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="92.45" dur="3.809">making sense and that&amp;#39;s because things</text>
  <text start="94.31" dur="6.119">are left out or the calculations have</text>
  <text start="96.259" dur="6.541">changed now the Consumer Price Index for</text>
  <text start="100.429" dur="4.58">used cars and trucks it shows that</text>
  <text start="102.8" dur="6.78">there&amp;#39;s been zero percent inflation</text>
  <text start="105.009" dur="7.631">since 1994 in used cars and trucks</text>
  <text start="109.58" dur="5.819">despite actual prices having soared so</text>
  <text start="112.64" dur="3.99">yes the CPI for used vehicles in June as</text>
  <text start="115.399" dur="4.5">reported by the Bureau of Labor</text>
  <text start="116.63" dur="6.15">Statistics fell 0.7 percent from June a</text>
  <text start="119.899" dur="6.571">year ago and is where it had been in</text>
  <text start="122.78" dur="5.399">April of 1994 now let&amp;#39;s think about this</text>
  <text start="126.47" dur="4.739">for a second we&amp;#39;ve had zero percent</text>
  <text start="128.179" dur="6.331">inflation since 94 how did they get</text>
  <text start="131.209" dur="7.201">these numbers well it looks like they</text>
  <text start="134.51" dur="7.199">used hedonic quality adjustment so the</text>
  <text start="138.41" dur="6.45">question is what is this well in price</text>
  <text start="141.709" dur="6.06">index methodology hedonic quality</text>
  <text start="144.86" dur="6.439">adjustment has come to mean the practice</text>
  <text start="147.769" dur="6.481">of decomposing an item into its</text>
  <text start="151.299" dur="5.291">constituent characteristics obtaining</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="4.14">estimates of the value of the utility</text>
  <text start="156.59" dur="4.38">derived from each characteristics and</text>
  <text start="158.39" dur="5.46">using those value estimates to adjust</text>
  <text start="160.97" dur="6.54">prices when the quality of good changes</text>
  <text start="163.85" dur="7.859">so this is what the BLS is doing to</text>
  <text start="167.51" dur="6.81">change the inflation calculations now of</text>
  <text start="171.709" dur="5.821">course as we know car prices have been</text>
  <text start="174.32" dur="5.34">moving up not down and just like with</text>
  <text start="177.53" dur="3.75">every other item we&amp;#39;ve seen them move up</text>
  <text start="179.66" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s causing more and more to purchase</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="4.789">a car now what&amp;#39;s also very interesting</text>
  <text start="183.5" dur="4.67">about the automobile industry</text>
  <text start="186.069" dur="5.521">used to calculate you know the</text>
  <text start="188.17" dur="7.56">deliveries of the automobiles but now we</text>
  <text start="191.59" dur="8.069">see that GM stopped reporting its</text>
  <text start="195.73" dur="5.819">deliveries in April and GM accounts for</text>
  <text start="199.659" dur="4.651">over 70 percent of all new vehicle</text>
  <text start="201.549" dur="4.651">market and as of April the industry has</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="4.379">to fill that hole with estimates so now</text>
  <text start="206.2" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re estimating the deliveries of</text>
  <text start="208.689" dur="4.741">these new vehicles now the new vehicle</text>
  <text start="211.81" dur="5.069">market in terms of the number of</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="6.539">deliveries peaked in 2016 and decline in</text>
  <text start="216.879" dur="5.101">2017 the early part of this year was</text>
  <text start="219.969" dur="4.591">slightly stronger but now the market is</text>
  <text start="221.98" dur="4.86">losing steam again as more and more</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="4.259">consumers including many subprime</text>
  <text start="226.84" dur="3.78">borrowers that are getting locked out of</text>
  <text start="228.819" dur="3.75">the new vehicle market switched to use</text>
  <text start="230.62" dur="5.339">vehicles and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="232.569" dur="5.67">is that GM Fiat Chrysler Ford and all of</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="4.441">them well it seems like everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.239" dur="5.011">declining all at once and we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="4.53">seen this since the financial crisis now</text>
  <text start="243.25" dur="3.359">of course what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.93" dur="3.66">changing calculations they&amp;#39;re hiding</text>
  <text start="246.609" dur="3.99">information and they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="248.59" dur="4.59">it seem like everything is fantastic but</text>
  <text start="250.599" dur="4.14">as we can see it isn&amp;#39;t this reminds me</text>
  <text start="253.18" dur="3.479">of like the subprime securities where</text>
  <text start="254.739" dur="3.511">the rating agencies were out there and</text>
  <text start="256.659" dur="3.211">they&amp;#39;re telling us that these subprime</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="3.75">securities a triple-a but when you</text>
  <text start="259.87" dur="4.169">actually look into it you saw that</text>
  <text start="262" dur="4.56">people were defaulting you know people</text>
  <text start="264.039" dur="5.341">weren&amp;#39;t paying their mortgages it was a</text>
  <text start="266.56" dur="6.51">lot of speculation and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="6.24">see that these corporations they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="5.52">starting to change the way they</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="5.07">calculate do business how they provide</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="4.65">the numbers and they do this on purpose</text>
  <text start="280.69" dur="4.229">because they realize that the system&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.24" dur="5.19">coming down that they&amp;#39;re not doing as</text>
  <text start="284.919" dur="6.391">well and we saw this prior to 2008 and</text>
  <text start="288.43" dur="4.979">this is why the automobile industry had</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="4.05">a major problem they had a huge amount</text>
  <text start="293.409" dur="3.961">of debt they were lying a lot about</text>
  <text start="295.36" dur="4.14">their numbers and we&amp;#39;re seeing this with</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="4.59">many different corporations right now</text>
  <text start="299.5" dur="4.77">and as we can see that this is all going</text>
  <text start="301.96" dur="6.09">to come down and it&amp;#39;s gonna crash really</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="7.35">hard we see that home buyers they are</text>
  <text start="308.05" dur="9.299">choosing to wait it out now this reminds</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="8.12">me of the years of 2006 2007 2008 where</text>
  <text start="317.349" dur="4.281">all of a sudden people were</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="5.28">waiting and there were what they were</text>
  <text start="321.63" dur="5.37">watching and the prices now have gone up</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="4.649">to a certain point actually a lot higher</text>
  <text start="327" dur="4.47">than they were back in 2006 seven</text>
  <text start="329.669" dur="4.62">leading into eight now they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="331.47" dur="4.02">to fall and people are starting to see</text>
  <text start="334.289" dur="3.511">this so what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="335.49" dur="5.37">waiting on the sidelines and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="4.769">keep waiting also since the interest</text>
  <text start="340.86" dur="3.51">rates are moving up it&amp;#39;s kicking a lot</text>
  <text start="342.569" dur="2.85">of people out of the market so what they</text>
  <text start="344.37" dur="2.91">need to do is they need to wait for</text>
  <text start="345.419" dur="3.78">prices to come down because as interest</text>
  <text start="347.28" dur="3.389">rates rise they need those prices to</text>
  <text start="349.199" dur="4.321">come down so they can get back into the</text>
  <text start="350.669" dur="6">market we&amp;#39;re starting to see the same</text>
  <text start="353.52" dur="5.04">thing happen that we saw back in two</text>
  <text start="356.669" dur="5.34">thousand six seven and eight now of</text>
  <text start="358.56" dur="5.099">course we all know how that ended so</text>
  <text start="362.009" dur="4.771">we&amp;#39;re starting to see the same exact</text>
  <text start="363.659" dur="5.521">thing happen and we&amp;#39;re in the middle of</text>
  <text start="366.78" dur="3.87">the summer where a lot of people should</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="4.049">have purchased their homes already and</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re seeing existing homes new home</text>
  <text start="373.229" dur="5.19">sales pending home sales they are all</text>
  <text start="375.96" dur="3.929">declining and prices are starting to</text>
  <text start="378.419" dur="3.631">come down and what that means is as</text>
  <text start="379.889" dur="4.02">prices fall people are going to start</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="3.359">taking their homes off the market as</text>
  <text start="383.909" dur="3.54">people take their homes off the market</text>
  <text start="385.409" dur="4.021">we&amp;#39;re going to see traffic dry up</text>
  <text start="387.449" dur="3">there&amp;#39;s not going to be that many people</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="2.549">out there looking</text>
  <text start="390.449" dur="3.69">and of course we&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="391.979" dur="4.41">saying that there&amp;#39;s hardly any inventory</text>
  <text start="394.139" dur="4.261">out there and if prices are continually</text>
  <text start="396.389" dur="3.421">coming down and people taking there and</text>
  <text start="398.4" dur="3.21">people are taking their houses off the</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="4.32">market is just going to get worse this</text>
  <text start="401.61" dur="4.589">is what we saw prior to 2008 people put</text>
  <text start="404.13" dur="4.62">their houses up on the market they were</text>
  <text start="406.199" dur="4.981">hoping to get the top dollar people</text>
  <text start="408.75" dur="4.349">nobody was coming and then they started</text>
  <text start="411.18" dur="3.6">to lower it nobody was coming so they</text>
  <text start="413.099" dur="2.761">started lowered a little bit more nobody</text>
  <text start="414.78" dur="3.87">was coming and they said you know</text>
  <text start="415.86" dur="4.109">something this is ridiculous I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="418.65" dur="3">gonna sell the house right now because</text>
  <text start="419.969" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s getting to the point where I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="421.65" dur="3.449">gonna break even and I need the down to</text>
  <text start="423.659" dur="3.361">pay down payment or whatever they were</text>
  <text start="425.099" dur="3.901">going to use to get into the next house</text>
  <text start="427.02" dur="4.35">so they took the house off the market</text>
  <text start="429" dur="5.13">and then the house prices continually de</text>
  <text start="431.37" dur="4.949">you know fell over time and people</text>
  <text start="434.13" dur="3.48">started to go underwater so this they</text>
  <text start="436.319" dur="2.611">would they were definitely not going to</text>
  <text start="437.61" dur="3">sell and some people had no choice</text>
  <text start="438.93" dur="4.62">because they were losing their jobs so</text>
  <text start="440.61" dur="5.25">they had to short sale and we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="443.55" dur="4.89">in that same exact direction now and</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="4.679">it&amp;#39;s just going to get worse the economy</text>
  <text start="448.44" dur="4.42">is really not improving we wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.539" dur="4.991">follow this for quite a while right now</text>
  <text start="452.86" dur="4.769">and we&amp;#39;ve been watching the entire</text>
  <text start="455.53" dur="4.68">system completely fall apart even though</text>
  <text start="457.629" dur="4.051">the government the Fed and all the</text>
  <text start="460.21" dur="3.9">statistical information was telling us</text>
  <text start="461.68" dur="6.209">that everything was fantastic we were</text>
  <text start="464.11" dur="6.899">watching the same patterns occur that we</text>
  <text start="467.889" dur="5.28">saw prior to 2008 I mean really nothing</text>
  <text start="471.009" dur="5.19">has changed yes they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="473.169" dur="5.191">manipulate to print money to change the</text>
  <text start="476.199" dur="5.31">interest rates to change the calculation</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="5.369">but the same things going to happen yes</text>
  <text start="481.509" dur="4.62">you can push it out kick the can down</text>
  <text start="483.729" dur="4.321">the street as people would say as you</text>
  <text start="486.129" dur="4.021">know each time and hopefully everything</text>
  <text start="488.05" dur="4.5">works out but there&amp;#39;s a it comes a</text>
  <text start="490.15" dur="2.97">period of time where you can&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="492.55" dur="3.54">anymore</text>
  <text start="493.12" dur="4.68">and we&amp;#39;re at that point right now people</text>
  <text start="496.09" dur="6.9">are starting to notice that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.8" dur="8.639">something wrong and this was the fault</text>
  <text start="502.99" dur="6.66">of the central bankers because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.439" dur="4.711">the ones who created this illusion to</text>
  <text start="509.65" dur="5.699">make us think that the economy is</text>
  <text start="511.15" dur="7.65">fantastic and now it&amp;#39;s falling apart we</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="7.8">see host sale sales they have slumped in</text>
  <text start="518.8" dur="8.099">June expectations were for 8.2 percent</text>
  <text start="523.149" dur="6.75">rise in June after a 2.5 percent gain in</text>
  <text start="526.899" dur="5.25">May but the entire curve dropped with a</text>
  <text start="529.899" dur="5.43">point 1 percent drop in June after a</text>
  <text start="532.149" dur="5.641">revised lower 2.1 percent gain in May</text>
  <text start="535.329" dur="4.741">and once again a lot of these numbers</text>
  <text start="537.79" dur="4.799">all they&amp;#39;re doing is revising</text>
  <text start="540.07" dur="3.959">recalculating manipulating to make you</text>
  <text start="542.589" dur="3.271">think that things are really going well</text>
  <text start="544.029" dur="3.451">when they&amp;#39;re really not and they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="545.86" dur="6.03">this in the past and they continue to do</text>
  <text start="547.48" dur="6.24">this now as we know the Fed has changed</text>
  <text start="551.89" dur="4.74">the calculation of the yield curve and</text>
  <text start="553.72" dur="5.1">we can see why they&amp;#39;ve done this because</text>
  <text start="556.63" dur="5.31">what is happening right now is the same</text>
  <text start="558.82" dur="6.93">thing that happened in the past where</text>
  <text start="561.94" dur="6.87">every time the yield curve inverts it</text>
  <text start="565.75" dur="6.36">gives us an indicator that we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="568.81" dur="7.17">into a recession and we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="572.11" dur="6.3">2008 we saw this back in 2001 we saw it</text>
  <text start="575.98" dur="5.49">almost every single time that we had a</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="5.52">recession and we&amp;#39;re headed to that area</text>
  <text start="581.47" dur="4.75">once again and when we look at a graph</text>
  <text start="583.93" dur="5.23">we can see the pattern</text>
  <text start="586.22" dur="4.65">is exactly the same and of course what</text>
  <text start="589.16" dur="3.78">the central bankers want to do they</text>
  <text start="590.87" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t want you to know what is happening</text>
  <text start="592.94" dur="4.62">they they want to change the data high</text>
  <text start="595.37" dur="3.24">data and make sure you don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="597.56" dur="3.78">what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="598.61" dur="6.54">but we&amp;#39;ve just heard from Lord</text>
  <text start="601.34" dur="6.81">Rothschild he is saying that the New</text>
  <text start="605.15" dur="6.45">World Order is at risk and he pretty</text>
  <text start="608.15" dur="6.84">much laid out what they&amp;#39;re about to do</text>
  <text start="611.6" dur="5.04">with the global economy now remember</text>
  <text start="614.99" dur="4.23">they know because they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="616.64" dur="4.71">created all this that their system only</text>
  <text start="619.22" dur="4.32">lasts for a certain period of time and</text>
  <text start="621.35" dur="4.89">they were a hoping that they were going</text>
  <text start="623.54" dur="4.95">to cover all this up with an event like</text>
  <text start="626.24" dur="4.47">war this way they can say hey listen</text>
  <text start="628.49" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re in a war everyone has to sacrifice</text>
  <text start="630.71" dur="5.07">we can&amp;#39;t get the supplies to the stores</text>
  <text start="633.59" dur="4.2">credits freezing up right now and</text>
  <text start="635.78" dur="5.37">everyone has to tighten their belts and</text>

  <text start="641.15" dur="7.08">war right now so they have to come up</text>
  <text start="643.94" dur="8.04">with some other type of excuse so right</text>
  <text start="648.23" dur="6.51">now we&amp;#39;re hearing from the Rothschild</text>

  <text start="662.36" dur="5.28">since World War two and then Jacob</text>

  <text start="693.62" dur="6.18">capital partners Rothschild has made his</text>
  <text start="697.34" dur="4.86">latest warning to date this time</text>
  <text start="699.8" dur="4.38">focusing on the global economic system</text>
  <text start="702.2" dur="6.29">that was established after World War two</text>
  <text start="704.18" dur="9.57">and which he believes is now in jeopardy</text>
  <text start="708.49" dur="8.08">he pointed out to the us-china trade war</text>
  <text start="713.75" dur="5.91">and the eurozone crisis as the key</text>
  <text start="716.57" dur="6.53">problems putting economic order at</text>

  <text start="748.94" dur="5.01">economic security order he says anyone</text>
  <text start="751.91" dur="5.82">on to say that we are now seeing some</text>
  <text start="753.95" dur="7.23">areas of weaker growth emerge indeed the</text>
  <text start="757.73" dur="5.75">IMF has recently predicted some slowdown</text>
  <text start="761.18" dur="4.95">we had the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="763.48" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re out there saying the same exact</text>
  <text start="766.13" dur="5.61">thing the situation is extremely serious</text>
  <text start="769.15" dur="4.72">reciprocal trade restrictions cannot be</text>

  <text start="781.57" dur="7.6">Rothschild is out there he&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="785.18" dur="7.05">told you the plan they already placed</text>
  <text start="789.17" dur="5.79">the blame and this will be blamed on</text>
  <text start="792.23" dur="6.3">Trump they&amp;#39;re trying to maneuver the</text>
  <text start="794.96" dur="5.52">narrative and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="798.53" dur="5.1">everyone because of what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="800.48" dur="6.42">the system is going to come down well</text>
  <text start="803.63" dur="5.31">he&amp;#39;s partially right the system is going</text>
  <text start="806.9" dur="4.74">to come down but it&amp;#39;s not because of</text>
  <text start="808.94" dur="6.62">what Trump is doing what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="811.64" dur="7.89">right now he&amp;#39;s setting the system up to</text>
  <text start="815.56" dur="6.88">allow it to survive after the central</text>
  <text start="819.53" dur="4.86">banking system collapses the central</text>
  <text start="822.44" dur="5.19">bankers they are worried right now</text>
  <text start="824.39" dur="5.97">because they realize that their entire</text>
  <text start="827.63" dur="5.66">system is about to implode and they</text>
  <text start="830.36" dur="5.52">cannot point the finger someplace else</text>
  <text start="833.29" dur="5.53">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to point it at Trump</text>
  <text start="835.88" dur="5.97">but we see there&amp;#39;s other plans in the</text>
  <text start="838.82" dur="4.71">works and we understand that both sides</text>
  <text start="841.85" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re trying to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="843.53" dur="6.72">but we know the Rothschilds we know the</text>
  <text start="847.28" dur="4.86">central banking system we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="850.25" dur="2.51">the ones to blame for all of this</text>
  <text start="852.14" dur="2.63">they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="852.76" dur="4.14">ones who created all this they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="854.77" dur="3.45">ones who kept on printing</text>
  <text start="856.9" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re the ones who propped up the</text>
  <text start="858.22" dur="4.32">banks they&amp;#39;re the ones who lower their</text>
  <text start="860.44" dur="4.77">interest rates they&amp;#39;re the ones who are</text>
  <text start="862.54" dur="5.4">hiding all the information from the</text>
  <text start="865.21" dur="6.09">people around the world they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="867.94" dur="6.54">who created this system and if you go</text>
  <text start="871.3" dur="6.33">back in history this system what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="874.48" dur="5.91">created only lasts 40 to 45 years and</text>
  <text start="877.63" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re coming to the end now they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="880.39" dur="5.46">know what to do normally they have an</text>
  <text start="883.15" dur="5.07">event they don&amp;#39;t have one now so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="885.85" dur="5.04">trying to figure out a way around this</text>
  <text start="888.22" dur="6.15">and they&amp;#39;re hitting roadblocks because</text>
  <text start="890.89" dur="5.58">they want to show the world that the US</text>
  <text start="894.37" dur="4.62">economy is falling apart because what</text>
  <text start="896.47" dur="5.1">Trump is doing but the US economy</text>
  <text start="898.99" dur="4.65">through statistical manipulation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="901.57" dur="3.45">showing that the economy&amp;#39;s doing a lot</text>
  <text start="903.64" dur="3.84">better now they&amp;#39;re not going to come out</text>
  <text start="905.02" dur="5.1">and say hey they just manipulated the</text>
  <text start="907.48" dur="5.31">statistics because all Trump needs to do</text>
  <text start="910.12" dur="5.31">is turn around and say really let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="912.79" dur="4.56">what you&amp;#39;re doing and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="915.43" dur="4.05">you have an audit you have an audit bill</text>
  <text start="917.35" dur="3.84">and they&amp;#39;re not going to point that out</text>
  <text start="919.48" dur="4.2">and they&amp;#39;re also not going to point out</text>
  <text start="921.19" dur="4.71">the manipulation of statistics because</text>
  <text start="923.68" dur="3.69">all Trump and the Patriots have to do is</text>
  <text start="925.9" dur="4.17">go back in time and they&amp;#39;ll just show</text>
  <text start="927.37" dur="6.51">all this manipulation up into this point</text>
  <text start="930.07" dur="6.27">and all of a sudden the Fed prior</text>
  <text start="933.88" dur="5.4">administrations it all comes down people</text>
  <text start="936.34" dur="5.46">lose faith the entire world implodes and</text>
  <text start="939.28" dur="4.38">then you have riots and things like that</text>
  <text start="941.8" dur="3.69">and they&amp;#39;re trying to get around this</text>
  <text start="943.66" dur="3.27">they don&amp;#39;t want that to happen I mean if</text>
  <text start="945.49" dur="3.69">the central bankers were in charge and</text>
  <text start="946.93" dur="3.42">they had the narrative and everything</text>
  <text start="949.18" dur="2.94">was going the way they wanted and the</text>
  <text start="950.35" dur="3.81">person was in the White House that they</text>
  <text start="952.12" dur="4.35">wanted yes we might be headed in that</text>
  <text start="954.16" dur="5.64">direction but now things are changing</text>
  <text start="956.47" dur="6.42">and the central bank is kind of stuck</text>
  <text start="959.8" dur="5.04">this is their plan it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="962.89" dur="4.23">going to work because the deep state the</text>
  <text start="964.84" dur="4.49">central bank they all have plans it</text>
  <text start="967.12" dur="4.86">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they can follow through and</text>
  <text start="969.33" dur="4.66">it looks like they&amp;#39;re going to have a</text>
  <text start="971.98" dur="4.74">lot of trouble as we move forward</text>
  <text start="973.99" dur="5.1">because there&amp;#39;s other plans going</text>
  <text start="976.72" dur="4.11">against them and remember everything</text>
  <text start="979.09" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s being done right now is to</text>
  <text start="980.83" dur="5.31">weather the storm and to make sure the</text>
  <text start="983.83" dur="4.08">US can survive one</text>
  <text start="986.14" dur="2.88">we get onto the central banking system</text>
  <text start="987.91" dur="4.01">and this is why you see all these</text>
  <text start="989.02" dur="6.72">bilateral trade agreements being made</text>
  <text start="991.92" dur="6.31">outside of the normal channels because</text>
  <text start="995.74" dur="5.01">everything needs to be in place and of</text>
  <text start="998.23" dur="5.46">course with the UK wanting to leave the</text>
  <text start="1000.75" dur="5.07">EU with other countries looking at the</text>
  <text start="1003.69" dur="4.26">same exact thing the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1005.82" dur="6.63">they are scrambling now remember their</text>
  <text start="1007.95" dur="7.14">entire agenda was to have a one world</text>
  <text start="1012.45" dur="4.83">government one world currency system</text>
  <text start="1015.09" dur="3.45">which they controlled they were they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1017.28" dur="2.88">gonna be able to control all the</text>
  <text start="1018.54" dur="5.25">countries they were going to be able to</text>
  <text start="1020.16" dur="6.38">enslave every single person in their</text>
  <text start="1023.79" dur="5.25">system and make them work for peanuts</text>
  <text start="1026.54" dur="4.96">because they were going to make each</text>
  <text start="1029.04" dur="4.5">country a third world type of country</text>
  <text start="1031.5" dur="5.73">where you can just swap workers back and</text>
  <text start="1033.54" dur="6.78">forth we could never get ahead this was</text>
  <text start="1037.23" dur="4.68">their entire plan and it is falling</text>
  <text start="1040.32" dur="4.74">apart right now but one thing is for</text>
  <text start="1041.91" dur="5.61">sure as we can see we need to come out</text>
  <text start="1045.06" dur="4.56">of this system and move into a new</text>
