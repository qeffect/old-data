  <text start="121.119" dur="5.43">were safe that nobody could touch them</text>

  <text start="126.549" dur="4.201">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that their</text>
  <text start="128.14" dur="4.02">investigations that are happening all</text>
  <text start="130.75" dur="3.9">over the world not just here in the</text>

  <text start="134.65" dur="5.28">investigations going to come together in</text>
  <text start="136.65" dur="6.28">the very end and there is going to be</text>
  <text start="139.93" dur="5.339">many individuals that are going to be</text>
  <text start="142.93" dur="5.1">indicted and they&amp;#39;re going to stand</text>
  <text start="145.269" dur="6.211">trial and we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="148.03" dur="7.41">this already queue is already letting us</text>
  <text start="151.48" dur="7.729">know that Ukraine is doing some sort of</text>
  <text start="155.44" dur="6.72">investigation into Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="159.209" dur="4.001">manipulating the elections Ukraine was</text>
  <text start="162.16" dur="3.51">involved</text>
  <text start="163.21" dur="6.15">but there are other investigations going</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="7.74">on in Ukraine and I believe the focus is</text>
  <text start="169.36" dur="6">not Russia but it is Ukraine and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.41" dur="4.32">starting to see a lot of things come out</text>
  <text start="175.36" dur="7.94">of Ukraine a lot of people that are</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="8.46">implicated with Ukraine in criminal</text>
  <text start="183.3" dur="6.25">activities but before we get to that I</text>
  <text start="186.19" dur="5.55">wanted to go to Trump and healthcare and</text>
  <text start="189.55" dur="5.16">we know Obamacare was ruled to be</text>
  <text start="191.74" dur="5.22">unconstitutional and Trump came out and</text>
  <text start="194.71" dur="5.61">said listen I&amp;#39;m gonna postpone the plans</text>
  <text start="196.96" dur="6.3">for the great healthcare plan that I</text>
  <text start="200.32" dur="5.43">have until after the elections he</text>
  <text start="203.26" dur="4.38">tweeted out the following everybody</text>
  <text start="205.75" dur="3.84">agrees that Obamacare doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="207.64" dur="4.41">premiums and deductibles are far too</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="4.74">high really bad health care even the</text>
  <text start="212.05" dur="5.07">Dems want to replace it but with</text>
  <text start="214.33" dur="4.2">Medicare for all which could cause 180</text>
  <text start="217.12" dur="3.72">million Americans will lose their</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="3.87">beloved private health insurance the</text>
  <text start="220.84" dur="3.63">Republicans are developing a really</text>
  <text start="222.4" dur="4.71">great health care plan with far lower</text>
  <text start="224.47" dur="4.53">premiums cost and deductibles than Obama</text>
  <text start="227.11" dur="4.2">care in other words it will be far less</text>
  <text start="229" dur="4.86">expensive and much more usable than</text>
  <text start="231.31" dur="4.35">Obama care vote will be taken right</text>
  <text start="233.86" dur="4.62">after the election when Republicans hold</text>
  <text start="235.66" dur="5.4">the Senate and win back the house it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="238.48" dur="4.83">be truly great health care that will</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="4.32">work for America also Republicans will</text>
  <text start="243.31" dur="3.72">always support pre-existing conditions</text>
  <text start="245.38" dur="3.06">the Republican Party will be known as</text>
  <text start="247.03" dur="3.75">the party of great health care</text>
  <text start="248.44" dur="5.7">meantime USA is doing better than ever</text>
  <text start="250.78" dur="5.85">and is respected again and I believe he</text>
  <text start="254.14" dur="4.32">is waiting until after the elections</text>
  <text start="256.63" dur="5.07">because I don&amp;#39;t think he has the votes</text>
  <text start="258.46" dur="5.19">right now he doesn&amp;#39;t have the house he</text>
  <text start="261.7" dur="4.14">has the Senate but he needs the house</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="4.8">and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to work</text>
  <text start="265.84" dur="5.19">without having both because there are</text>
  <text start="268.45" dur="5.01">still those individuals that are part of</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="4.68">the deep state system that don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="4.23">Obamacare out of the picture they make a</text>
  <text start="275.71" dur="3.78">lot of money off of Obamacare the</text>
  <text start="277.69" dur="5.01">insurance companies make a lot of money</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="6.12">off the Obama care insurance and they</text>
  <text start="282.7" dur="5.19">don&amp;#39;t want to see this go and a lot of</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="6.27">these individuals have investments in</text>
  <text start="287.89" dur="5.91">these companies now Biden is having a</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="4.289">huge amount of trouble here</text>
  <text start="293.8" dur="3.869">first we had this woman that came up and</text>
  <text start="296.169" dur="3.991">said listen he grabbed me by the</text>
  <text start="297.669" dur="5.641">shoulders you know rub me in a weird way</text>
  <text start="300.16" dur="4.95">and it wasn&amp;#39;t nice now another woman</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="3.51">from Connecticut claims that Biden</text>
  <text start="305.11" dur="3.809">touched her inappropriately and rubbed</text>
  <text start="306.82" dur="4.02">noses with her during a 2009 political</text>
  <text start="308.919" dur="3.931">fundraiser in Greenwich Connecticut she</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="5.37">went on to say it wasn&amp;#39;t sexual but he</text>
  <text start="312.85" dur="5.4">grabbed me by the head he put his hand</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="4.38">around my neck and pulled me in to rub</text>
  <text start="318.25" dur="3.81">my nose with me when he was pulling me</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="4.23">in I thought he was going to kiss me on</text>
  <text start="322.06" dur="4.26">the mouth I never filed a complaint to</text>
  <text start="324.82" dur="3.63">be honest because he was the vice</text>
  <text start="326.32" dur="4.23">president I was nobody there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.45" dur="3.029">absolutely a line of decency there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="330.55" dur="3.66">line of respect</text>
  <text start="331.479" dur="5.19">crossing that line is not grandfatherly</text>
  <text start="334.21" dur="8.1">it&amp;#39;s not cultural it&amp;#39;s not affection</text>
  <text start="336.669" dur="7.921">it&amp;#39;s sexism or misogyny and we can see</text>
  <text start="342.31" dur="4.83">that the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="344.59" dur="5.37">there protecting him we see certain</text>
  <text start="347.14" dur="5.13">individuals or protecting him and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="5.37">running into a lot of problems right now</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="6.09">but I don&amp;#39;t believe that this is his</text>
  <text start="355.33" dur="5.67">main problem I believe his main problem</text>
  <text start="358.36" dur="5.28">is going to be in Ukraine along with</text>
  <text start="361" dur="6.53">Hillary along with Obama and the rest of</text>
  <text start="363.64" dur="8.37">them now do you remember back when</text>
  <text start="367.53" dur="6.97">Ukraine was in the middle of regime</text>
  <text start="372.01" dur="5.25">change the US and I shouldn&amp;#39;t say the</text>
  <text start="374.5" dur="6.84">u.s. to say the deep state spent five</text>
  <text start="377.26" dur="7.17">billion of the people&amp;#39;s money to push</text>
  <text start="381.34" dur="6.59">the riots in Ukraine to overthrow an</text>
  <text start="384.43" dur="8.91">elected leader and then put their own</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="10.47">person into power well this was part of</text>
  <text start="393.34" dur="10.11">Obama&amp;#39;s John Kerry&amp;#39;s Biden&amp;#39;s plan and</text>
  <text start="398.4" dur="7.96">they pushed their agenda in Ukraine when</text>

  <text start="412.6" dur="7.8">Ukraine&amp;#39;s largest private gas firm so</text>
  <text start="417.1" dur="8.88">the vice president&amp;#39;s son joined charisma</text>
