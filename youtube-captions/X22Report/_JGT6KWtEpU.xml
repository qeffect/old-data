  <text start="87.28" dur="6.449">to have to watch that situation very</text>
  <text start="88.72" dur="7.829">carefully now UN inspectors were looking</text>
  <text start="93.729" dur="5.611">at the bombings in Yemen and they</text>
  <text start="96.549" dur="6.951">visited the AL kameez market in</text>
  <text start="99.34" dur="7.68">northwestern Yemen where Saudi bombed</text>
  <text start="103.5" dur="5.229">hundreds of people in this area and when</text>
  <text start="107.02" dur="5.4">they look they said there is absolutely</text>
  <text start="108.729" dur="7.471">no evidence whatsoever that the attack</text>
  <text start="112.42" dur="7.29">could have any military goal the closest</text>
  <text start="116.2" dur="8.34">target of any value to justify bombing</text>
  <text start="119.71" dur="9.35">is a small checkpoint 250 meters from</text>
  <text start="124.54" dur="8.699">the market this was done on purpose and</text>
  <text start="129.06" dur="8.23">the United Nations is saying that most</text>
  <text start="133.239" dur="7.141">of the carnage is caused by Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="137.29" dur="5.31">and their air strikes in Yemen not</text>

  <text start="148.06" dur="6.72">United States and when they say when</text>
  <text start="152.769" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re looking at this and looking at</text>
  <text start="154.78" dur="4.62">the figures it would seem that the</text>
  <text start="156.549" dur="6.121">Coalition is responsible for twice as</text>
  <text start="159.4" dur="5.45">many civilian casualties as all other</text>
  <text start="162.67" dur="5.76">forces put together</text>
  <text start="164.85" dur="6.61">virtually all as a result of the air</text>
  <text start="168.43" dur="5.13">strikes now it&amp;#39;s amazing because on the</text>
  <text start="171.46" dur="4.47">corporate media the US government is</text>

  <text start="412.629" dur="4.14">us you&amp;#39;re against us it seems like all</text>
  <text start="414.939" dur="5.4">these dictators say this same exact</text>
  <text start="416.769" dur="6.33">thing it seems like they have the same</text>
  <text start="420.339" dur="6.33">message all these individuals that are</text>
  <text start="423.099" dur="5.73">part of the central banking system where</text>
  <text start="426.669" dur="5.321">they&amp;#39;re being driven to do one thing and</text>
  <text start="428.829" dur="5.951">one thing only and that is</text>
  <text start="431.99" dur="7.07">to keep the people down to remove their</text>
  <text start="434.78" dur="6.87">rights and to push war right now and</text>
  <text start="439.06" dur="5.56">right now we see Ankara is planning to</text>
  <text start="441.65" dur="6.42">deploy an arm an eye on fist against</text>
  <text start="444.62" dur="4.62">terrorism which means they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="448.07" dur="2.85">be going after anyone that disagrees</text>
  <text start="449.24" dur="4.59">with the government or tries to report</text>
  <text start="450.92" dur="7.98">about what the government is doing or is</text>
  <text start="453.83" dur="8.52">fighting for freedom of speech now the</text>
  <text start="458.9" dur="6.96">whole entire operation for Russia and</text>
  <text start="462.35" dur="8.25">Syria costs about about 460 million</text>
  <text start="465.86" dur="9.39">dollars the US since the beginning has</text>
  <text start="470.6" dur="10.13">been spending nine million a day to</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="8.64">fight the same terror group and Russia</text>
  <text start="480.73" dur="7.78">was able to accomplish this in a couple</text>
  <text start="483.89" dur="7.62">of months the US was going on 18 plus</text>
  <text start="488.51" dur="6.9">months and the Islamic state was</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="7.62">expanding in Syria and Iraq and how we</text>
  <text start="495.41" dur="8.49">see things have dramatically changed now</text>
  <text start="499.13" dur="7.65">we understand that the Kurds of course</text>
  <text start="503.9" dur="5.46">the US has cozied up to them in the</text>
  <text start="506.78" dur="6.63">northern area of Syria because we know</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="6.57">that carry his plan B wants to break up</text>
  <text start="513.41" dur="7.08">the middle east we know NATO it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="515.93" dur="8.49">same as the plan a and we see that the</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="6.69">Kurdish areas they&amp;#39;re occupied by many</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="7.2">more religions and ethnicities than just</text>
  <text start="527.18" dur="8.07">the Kurds including Syrian Arabs Turkmen</text>
  <text start="531.62" dur="7.61">and others but this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="535.25" dur="10.17">stage of where they want to go with this</text>
  <text start="539.23" dur="8.71">and what is more concerning is how the</text>
  <text start="545.42" dur="5.64">Kurdish declaration matches up with the</text>
  <text start="547.94" dur="5.52">Western plan B for the Syria all along</text>
  <text start="551.06" dur="4.7">that is the fracturing of the country in</text>
  <text start="553.46" dur="6.18">two separate states based solely on</text>
  <text start="555.76" dur="7.93">religion and ethnicity consider the</text>
  <text start="559.64" dur="5.819">statement made by salim ali from the PYD</text>
  <text start="563.69" dur="3.949">representative in moscow</text>
  <text start="565.459" dur="5.1">now when he said that Syrian Kurds</text>
  <text start="567.639" dur="5.14">expect their experience with autonomy to</text>
  <text start="570.559" dur="5.28">be spread to other ethnicities and</text>
  <text start="572.779" dur="5.37">religious groups in Syria he stated that</text>
  <text start="575.839" dur="7.56">our experience would be useful for the</text>
  <text start="578.149" dur="8.69">Alawite and Sunnis in other words he is</text>
  <text start="583.399" dur="6.18">suggesting that not just the Kurds</text>
  <text start="586.839" dur="6.401">maintain a federalized autonomous state</text>
  <text start="589.579" dur="6.841">but the other religious groups should do</text>
  <text start="593.24" dur="7.56">the same and we should maybe break the</text>
  <text start="596.42" dur="9.839">country into an Alawite section a Sunni</text>
  <text start="600.8" dur="8.519">section and occurred section and any</text>
  <text start="606.259" dur="6.87">other sections that we need so we can</text>
  <text start="609.319" dur="8.13">see they&amp;#39;re initiating this under the</text>
  <text start="613.129" dur="6.45">direction of the US this is their plan</text>
  <text start="617.449" dur="4.98">they want to do this in Iraq actually</text>
  <text start="619.579" dur="5.04">Biden brought a plan to the president of</text>
  <text start="622.429" dur="4.921">a rack of splitting up Iraq and they</text>
  <text start="624.619" dur="4.981">completely said absolutely not now the</text>
  <text start="627.35" dur="5.07">Islamic state they&amp;#39;re losing more and</text>
  <text start="629.6" dur="5.429">more ground they have lost over a</text>
  <text start="632.42" dur="5.609">quarter of their territory in Iraq and</text>
  <text start="635.029" dur="5.4">Syria and they&amp;#39;re losing more and more</text>
  <text start="638.029" dur="5.881">each day the Syrian Armed Forces are</text>
  <text start="640.429" dur="5.58">liberating cities and towns Russian more</text>
  <text start="643.91" dur="3.929">planes they targeted the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="646.009" dur="5.281">oil facilities near the strategic town</text>
  <text start="647.839" dur="9.24">in the province of Homs and we see right</text>
  <text start="651.29" dur="10.049">now the Iraqi forces they have pushed</text>
  <text start="657.079" dur="6.3">and they&amp;#39;re trying to regain muscle from</text>
  <text start="661.339" dur="5.131">the Islamic state so we have all of this</text>
  <text start="663.379" dur="6.21">going on and the Islamic state is losing</text>
  <text start="666.47" dur="5.219">ground at this point in time now as we</text>
  <text start="669.589" dur="4.53">know the Islamic state the moderate</text>
  <text start="671.689" dur="5.58">rebels Free Syrian Army al-nusrah</text>
  <text start="674.119" dur="6.361">al-qaeda they always resort to chemical</text>
  <text start="677.269" dur="7.23">weapons when they start losing and/or</text>
  <text start="680.48" dur="7.229">they use them to frame Assad but we see</text>
  <text start="684.499" dur="5.28">right now that the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="687.709" dur="4.44">might be pushed right now where they</text>
  <text start="689.779" dur="4.591">might use chemical attacks maybe in the</text>
  <text start="692.149" dur="4.591">next couple of weeks because they are</text>
  <text start="694.37" dur="5.009">really losing ground right now and they</text>
  <text start="696.74" dur="4.739">will become desperate</text>
  <text start="699.379" dur="4.89">Syrian opposition group is saying that</text>
  <text start="701.479" dur="5.73">the Syrian government is procrastinating</text>
  <text start="704.269" dur="4.74">right now in peace talks saying that</text>
  <text start="707.209" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re really not engaging fully in the</text>
  <text start="709.009" dur="5.01">negotiations well because the opposition</text>
  <text start="712.639" dur="4.29">is saying one thing and one thing only</text>
  <text start="714.019" dur="7.29">Assad you must step down Assad you must</text>
  <text start="716.929" dur="7.5">step down the Saudi Arabia Syrian</text>

  <text start="724.429" dur="8.06">should not be supporting Damascus and</text>
  <text start="727.659" dur="9.96">they should separate themselves from</text>
