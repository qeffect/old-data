  <text start="68.27" dur="7.48">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that all of this</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="6.621">is true because when we look at the</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="7.47">White House and who has come to visit</text>

  <text start="113.01" dur="4.02">become allies in advocating for</text>

  <text start="146.4" dur="6.419">tells you that they are continually</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="10.47">moving and going in there to push</text>
  <text start="152.819" dur="10.021">agendas now Obama is doing whatever he</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="4.8">possibly can to get weapons away from</text>
  <text start="162.84" dur="2.94">the people</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="6.11">and they tried many different false</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="10.17">flags a lot of these false flags are</text>
  <text start="170.42" dur="8.28">basically being shown as hoaxes showing</text>
  <text start="175.95" dur="6.39">that the government is actually</text>
  <text start="178.7" dur="7.899">orchestrating the entire event for their</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="7.32">agenda and every time Obama comes out</text>
  <text start="186.599" dur="8.881">and does one of these mass shootings gun</text>
  <text start="189.66" dur="9.02">sales go up so what does he do well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.48" dur="8.24">going to go after the gun manufacturers</text>
  <text start="198.68" dur="5.04">he&amp;#39;s going after Smith &amp;amp; Wesson</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="4.929">basically what they&amp;#39;ve done is they sent</text>
  <text start="207" dur="4.349">federal regulators to investigate</text>
  <text start="209.069" dur="5.28">whether the gun manufacturer Smith &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="211.349" dur="5.461">Wesson had made adequate disclosures in</text>
  <text start="214.349" dur="4.411">its financial statements because you</text>
  <text start="216.81" dur="6.75">have to remember they&amp;#39;re showing an</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="6.21">increase in sales stocks are going up so</text>
  <text start="223.56" dur="5.19">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re siccing</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="9.38">the SEC on them and they&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="228.75" dur="9.18">through everything and we know that</text>
  <text start="234.35" dur="5.68">they&amp;#39;re going to find something or tell</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="4.02">them they didn&amp;#39;t have something which no</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="3.09">one knew about because they just made it</text>
  <text start="241.95" dur="3.509">up as they went along in the</text>
  <text start="243.12" dur="7.89">investigation because we know how well</text>
  <text start="245.459" dur="7.801">the SE SEC works look at all the</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="4.86">corruption that happened all around us</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="5.729">with the banking system the problem with</text>
  <text start="255.87" dur="8.549">Corzine where a lot of people lost their</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="7.591">wealth Madoff I mean they had no clue</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="7.56">what was going on but here we have the</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="8.66">suc going in and basically going into a</text>
  <text start="271.979" dur="7.971">gun manufacturer this is not coincidence</text>
  <text start="275.24" dur="8.86">this is being done on purpose now out in</text>
  <text start="279.95" dur="6.33">Montenegro we know that NATO issued a</text>
  <text start="284.1" dur="6.33">formal invitation for the former</text>
  <text start="286.28" dur="7.75">Republic of Montenegro and they did this</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="5.489">on December second and Montenegro</text>
  <text start="294.03" dur="4.14">accepted the following day now of course</text>
  <text start="295.919" dur="4.651">this makes Russia I&amp;#39;m very very nervous</text>
  <text start="298.17" dur="6.61">but what happened was there were</text>
  <text start="300.57" dur="8.38">protests and people out on the streets</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="6.3">saying no we don&amp;#39;t want this and 5,000</text>
  <text start="308.95" dur="6.21">people gather on the streets to oppose</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="7.89">the decision and Russia is saying we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="315.16" dur="7.74">wait a minute let&amp;#39;s hear from the people</text>
  <text start="318.97" dur="6.78">and let them decide if they want to have</text>
  <text start="322.9" dur="7.82">their country join NATO because as the</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="8.19">US always says let the people have</text>
  <text start="330.72" dur="6.13">freedom democracy to choose their own</text>
  <text start="333.94" dur="5.1">path well the u.s. only says this when</text>
  <text start="336.85" dur="5.58">they basically do a regime change and</text>
  <text start="339.04" dur="4.74">they put in a puppet government and then</text>
  <text start="342.43" dur="3.3">after the puppet government is there</text>
  <text start="343.78" dur="3.93">they don&amp;#39;t want democracy they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="345.73" dur="4.8">want freedom they don&amp;#39;t want the people</text>
  <text start="347.71" dur="6.65">to decide this is why they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="350.53" dur="7.61">the people of Syria to really decide</text>
  <text start="354.36" dur="7.27">because they&amp;#39;re not controlling them in</text>
  <text start="358.14" dur="7.93">Ukraine they had the coup d&amp;#39;etat they</text>
  <text start="361.63" dur="6.57">removed the elected government in Syria</text>
  <text start="366.07" dur="5.15">they&amp;#39;re having a problem with this and</text>
  <text start="368.2" dur="5.67">if they let the people in Syria vote</text>
  <text start="371.22" dur="4.24">they know which way it&amp;#39;s going to go and</text>
  <text start="373.87" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s not going to be in the United</text>
  <text start="375.46" dur="5.33">States favor now we see the war drums</text>
  <text start="378.16" dur="6.21">are getting louder and louder in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="380.79" dur="6.67">right now Yatsenyuk has decided to</text>
  <text start="384.37" dur="5.25">suspend trade with Crimea in the next 30</text>
  <text start="387.46" dur="4.83">days which would bring us into January</text>
  <text start="389.62" dur="6.21">the mints to ceasefire agreement expires</text>
  <text start="392.29" dur="8.25">the end of December Kiev has not adhered</text>
  <text start="395.83" dur="7.61">to the agreement so basically what</text>
  <text start="400.54" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re getting prepared</text>
  <text start="403.44" dur="5.86">they&amp;#39;re cutting off trade already so</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="7.37">Putin signs a decree suspending free</text>
  <text start="409.3" dur="6.6">trade with Ukraine starting January and</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="4.359">we can see this is going back and forth</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="3.93">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all</text>
  <text start="417.669" dur="4.111">this as we know they&amp;#39;ve been bringing</text>
  <text start="419.83" dur="5.01">military assets up to the contact line</text>
  <text start="421.78" dur="7.85">in the southeastern area and in Crimea</text>
  <text start="424.84" dur="6.66">but the United States they just issued a</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="8.2">warning</text>
  <text start="431.5" dur="10.44">to all US citizens to basically defer</text>
  <text start="437.83" dur="7.67">all travel to Crimea and the eastern</text>
  <text start="441.94" dur="8.94">regions of Donetsk and Lugansk not Kiev</text>
  <text start="445.5" dur="7.3">just those areas and recommends those US</text>
  <text start="450.88" dur="6.08">citizens current living in or visiting</text>
  <text start="452.8" dur="6.36">these regions to leave immediately and</text>
  <text start="456.96" dur="4.15">they&amp;#39;re saying this supersedes the</text>
  <text start="459.16" dur="4.59">warning that they had back in July</text>
  <text start="461.11" dur="4.559">sixteenth of this year when they tried</text>
  <text start="463.75" dur="7.56">to push that offensive and it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="465.669" dur="9.841">work out so right now we have warnings</text>
  <text start="471.31" dur="8.34">in Ukraine which were just which were</text>
  <text start="475.51" dur="8.46">just issued they&amp;#39;re getting prepared</text>
  <text start="479.65" dur="9.23">they&amp;#39;re getting ready now out in Libya</text>
  <text start="483.97" dur="8.699">we understand the UN the United States</text>
  <text start="488.88" dur="6.7">Italy France they were all hoping that</text>
  <text start="492.669" dur="7.261">the elected government and the puppet</text>
  <text start="495.58" dur="6.39">government would sign a deal which would</text>
  <text start="499.93" dur="4.17">unify the government&amp;#39;s but again we had</text>
  <text start="501.97" dur="4.41">a representative what that was thrown</text>
  <text start="504.1" dur="4.5">out of the elected government which was</text>
  <text start="506.38" dur="3.96">trying to represent the elected</text>
  <text start="508.6" dur="7.1">government and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="510.34" dur="8.37">in time that there is no deal the deal</text>
  <text start="515.7" dur="5.26">completely fell apart the leaders of the</text>
  <text start="518.71" dur="5.19">Libya&amp;#39;s rival Parliament&amp;#39;s rejected a UN</text>
  <text start="520.96" dur="7.23">peace deal a day before moderates from</text>
  <text start="523.9" dur="7.05">both sides were due to sign it so the</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="4.29">whole deal is completely off and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.95" dur="5.25">very interesting about all this once</text>
  <text start="532.48" dur="7.65">again is David Cameron is basically</text>
  <text start="536.2" dur="7.4">thinking about whether to extend the</text>
  <text start="540.13" dur="9.12">bombing of the Islamic state to Libya</text>
  <text start="543.6" dur="10.3">after the failure of the agreement in</text>

  <text start="553.9" dur="6.059">missions France is saying that the</text>
  <text start="557.589" dur="7.891">Islamic state is moving inland to get</text>
  <text start="559.959" dur="8.74">more oil fields and the</text>
  <text start="565.48" dur="9.31">unity government deal completely fell</text>
  <text start="568.699" dur="11.79">apart England with France are looking to</text>
  <text start="574.79" dur="9.539">go in and bomb the Islamic state the</text>
  <text start="580.489" dur="7.53">u.s. is saying yes this is something we</text>
  <text start="584.329" dur="10.05">should do but we have to be very careful</text>
  <text start="588.019" dur="8.701">that we don&amp;#39;t hit civilians or cause</text>
  <text start="594.379" dur="6.81">problems in Libya they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="596.72" dur="8.099">that they&amp;#39;re going into Libya they tried</text>

  <text start="843.59" dur="5.7">went into the hands of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="845.68" dur="6.28">we see the Toyota trucks that the</text>
  <text start="849.29" dur="4.89">Islamic state uses all of this is being</text>
  <text start="851.96" dur="5.22">brought over from the United States into</text>
  <text start="854.18" dur="5.87">this area the Toyota trucks are</text>
  <text start="857.18" dur="7.35">basically done by the US government</text>
  <text start="860.05" dur="5.17">other trucks are being sold and of</text>
  <text start="864.53" dur="3.27">course they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="865.22" dur="4.32">intermediaries buying these trucks so</text>
  <text start="867.8" dur="3.45">you can&amp;#39;t trace who is actually</text>
  <text start="869.54" dur="3.81">purchasing but that what we saw</text>
  <text start="871.25" dur="5.25">yesterday and what we talked about</text>
  <text start="873.35" dur="7.26">yesterday were these hackers basically</text>
  <text start="876.5" dur="7.38">tracing back for the propaganda from the</text>
  <text start="880.61" dur="5.31">Islamic state which originated in the UK</text>
  <text start="883.88" dur="4.65">so we can see that this is all</text>
  <text start="885.92" dur="5.43">governmental based we can see the</text>
  <text start="888.53" dur="5.13">government is controlling all of this</text>
  <text start="891.35" dur="5.1">not just the US government UK government</text>
  <text start="893.66" dur="5.4">Israel the coalition forces because</text>
  <text start="896.45" dur="6.66">their main objective is to have Assad</text>
  <text start="899.06" dur="7.04">removed right now Syrian warplanes they</text>
  <text start="903.11" dur="8.13">pounded the Islamic state supply routes</text>
  <text start="906.1" dur="8.35">they destroyed basically the entire area</text>
  <text start="911.24" dur="7.5">around Aleppo and they destroyed</text>
  <text start="914.45" dur="9.09">strongholds in Aleppo and we know at</text>
  <text start="918.74" dur="8.88">this point that the main goal of the</text>
  <text start="923.54" dur="8.58">United States is to remove Assad now</text>
  <text start="927.62" dur="8.76">John Kerry has come out and he is</text>
  <text start="932.12" dur="8.16">agreeing with Putin and un</text>
  <text start="936.38" dur="7.92">secretary-general ban ki-moon that Assad</text>
  <text start="940.28" dur="6.9">will stay in power they do not want him</text>
  <text start="944.3" dur="6.41">removed of course this is lip service</text>
  <text start="947.18" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before where Putin</text>
  <text start="950.71" dur="3.67">brokered a deal with chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="952.7" dur="3.96">and saying this is all you want from</text>
  <text start="954.38" dur="3.96">Assad you just want the chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="956.66" dur="4.02">gone and that&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="958.34" dur="3.99">actually end up doing and they said yes</text>
  <text start="960.68" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s all we want and then we had the</text>
  <text start="962.33" dur="3.72">Geneva 1 the Geneva 2 talks and only</text>
  <text start="964.73" dur="3.69">thing on the</text>
  <text start="966.05" dur="5.31">States&amp;#39;s agenda was to have a sod step</text>
  <text start="968.42" dur="5.22">down right now the United States is</text>
  <text start="971.36" dur="5.64">backed into a corner right now the</text>
  <text start="973.64" dur="7.19">Islamic state is being destroyed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="977" dur="6.269">airlifting their proxy army out of Syria</text>
  <text start="980.83" dur="5.92">now I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised of the</text>
  <text start="983.269" dur="4.921">United States joins in and pretends to</text>
  <text start="986.75" dur="3.18">go after the Islamic state and they</text>
  <text start="988.19" dur="4.44">continually airlift them all out of</text>
  <text start="989.93" dur="8.25">there because they have to make it look</text>
  <text start="992.63" dur="10.38">like they&amp;#39;re working with Russia but we</text>
  <text start="998.18" dur="8.43">have to remember in the background of</text>
  <text start="1003.01" dur="8.569">all of this they&amp;#39;re preparing a major</text>
  <text start="1006.61" dur="8.46">army they&amp;#39;re preparing another tactic</text>
  <text start="1011.579" dur="7.981">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to make an</text>
  <text start="1015.07" dur="8.519">additional move so what we hear today</text>
  <text start="1019.56" dur="10.119">most likely is a lie because think about</text>
  <text start="1023.589" dur="9.181">it they spent what seven what six years</text>
  <text start="1029.679" dur="7.351">five years i should say five years right</text>
  <text start="1032.77" dur="7.59">now of trying to remove Assad convincing</text>
  <text start="1037.03" dur="6.77">the world he&amp;#39;s a dictator he kills his</text>
  <text start="1040.36" dur="7.62">own people he gases his own people he</text>
  <text start="1043.8" dur="8.619">tortures his own people they paid</text>
  <text start="1047.98" dur="7.98">billions of dollars for the Free Syrian</text>
  <text start="1052.419" dur="7.111">Army billions of dollars to train the</text>
  <text start="1055.96" dur="6.959">Islamic state and al-qaeda they sent in</text>
  <text start="1059.53" dur="7.02">billions of dollars of military assets</text>
  <text start="1062.919" dur="7.561">into Syria and they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="1066.55" dur="8.85">agree with Russia and the UN and say</text>
  <text start="1070.48" dur="7.65">yeah Assad can stay what would be the</text>
  <text start="1075.4" dur="7.11">point of all of this because if Assad</text>
  <text start="1078.13" dur="7.26">stays that means he has control of his</text>
  <text start="1082.51" dur="6.33">country once again if he has control of</text>
  <text start="1085.39" dur="9">his country once again there is no</text>
  <text start="1088.84" dur="9.81">pipeline there&amp;#39;s no putting the central</text>
  <text start="1094.39" dur="5.489">bank inside of Syria there&amp;#39;s no way of</text>
  <text start="1098.65" dur="3.809">putting the dollar</text>
  <text start="1099.879" dur="6.32">on their natural resources and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1102.459" dur="6.36">no way they&amp;#39;re going to get to Iran</text>
  <text start="1106.199" dur="5.47">because they were hoping with this Great</text>
  <text start="1108.819" dur="5.52">War which is still coming I ran with</text>
  <text start="1111.669" dur="4.47">joining in the fight by joining it in</text>
  <text start="1114.339" dur="8.91">the fight they have access to go after</text>
  <text start="1116.139" dur="10.71">Iran so at this point we can see that</text>
  <text start="1123.249" dur="5.73">this is lip service we need to look at</text>
  <text start="1126.849" dur="5.01">their actions let&amp;#39;s see what the next</text>
  <text start="1128.979" dur="8.61">step is and the next step is going to be</text>
  <text start="1131.859" dur="7.71">an event to change everything this is</text>
  <text start="1137.589" dur="6">what&amp;#39;s happening right now now John</text>
  <text start="1139.569" dur="7.08">McAfee he is out there and he says the</text>
  <text start="1143.589" dur="6.18">West is living in a doomsday machine of</text>
  <text start="1146.649" dur="5.28">our own design and it&amp;#39;s only a matter of</text>
  <text start="1149.769" dur="5.76">time before our weapons and technology</text>
  <text start="1151.929" dur="5.55">are turned against us what is he talking</text>
  <text start="1155.529" dur="5.21">about he&amp;#39;s talking about how the</text>
  <text start="1157.479" dur="8.1">government has left their networks</text>
  <text start="1160.739" dur="9.4">completely open to hacking he says in a</text>
  <text start="1165.579" dur="6.69">modern world which has the power grid</text>
  <text start="1170.139" dur="4.95">nuclear power stations planes cars and</text>
  <text start="1172.269" dur="5.671">the financial infrastructure all tied in</text>
  <text start="1175.089" dur="7.34">through networking are all just sitting</text>
  <text start="1177.94" dur="6.899">there waiting for a major cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1182.429" dur="5.35">the only problem with this whole entire</text>
  <text start="1184.839" dur="6.12">scenario is that this attack most likely</text>
  <text start="1187.779" dur="5.911">will start from the inside and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1190.959" dur="5.31">talking about a false flag where the</text>
  <text start="1193.69" dur="4.969">government of the United States makes it</text>
  <text start="1196.269" dur="5.13">look like it&amp;#39;s coming from another</text>
  <text start="1198.659" dur="5.77">country or another group now maybe later</text>
  <text start="1201.399" dur="4.71">on once the war gets started of course</text>
  <text start="1204.429" dur="4.74">the other nations will hit our</text>
  <text start="1206.109" dur="6.42">infrastructure will hit our financial</text>
  <text start="1209.169" dur="7.62">infrastructure so he is right on that</text>
  <text start="1212.529" dur="5.7">side but when this starts out it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1216.789" dur="3.18">to come from the inside they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1218.229" dur="3.72">preparing for this they&amp;#39;ve been getting</text>
  <text start="1219.969" dur="3.57">ready for this because this is how</text>
  <text start="1221.949" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re going to take all eyes off of</text>
  <text start="1223.539" dur="5.58">them when this and when this economy</text>
  <text start="1225.459" dur="5.94">comes crumbling down now the FBI James</text>
  <text start="1229.119" dur="4.651">Comey is out there letting us know that</text>
  <text start="1231.399" dur="3.871">the Islamic state terrorists</text>
  <text start="1233.77" dur="8.46">a different sort of threat than al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1235.27" dur="10.53">al Qaeda is basically an all-out one big</text>
  <text start="1242.23" dur="7.26">boom type of terror organization the</text>
  <text start="1245.8" dur="9.42">Islamic state they like to spread out</text>
  <text start="1249.49" dur="8.88">their attacks in smaller areas and they</text>
  <text start="1255.22" dur="4.8">do it all at once and this fits into</text>
  <text start="1258.37" dur="5.52">what we&amp;#39;ve been saying for quite a while</text>
  <text start="1260.02" dur="6.09">that they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for some</text>
  <text start="1263.89" dur="5.46">type of an event across the country</text>
  <text start="1266.11" dur="4.74">where it will be a dirty nuke where it</text>
  <text start="1269.35" dur="4.32">will be either a chemical or biological</text>
  <text start="1270.85" dur="7.35">weapon and it will happen in multiple</text>
  <text start="1273.67" dur="8.37">locations he&amp;#39;s also saying that these</text>
  <text start="1278.2" dur="7.41">terrorists are using encryption once</text>
  <text start="1282.04" dur="6.75">again saying that this encryption allows</text>
  <text start="1285.61" dur="4.98">the terrorists to go dark and law</text>
  <text start="1288.79" dur="5.49">enforcement cannot trace them whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1290.59" dur="7.74">and he says encryption is at the center</text>
  <text start="1294.28" dur="9.18">of terrorist tradecraft well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1298.33" dur="8.07">going on their iPhones facebook twitter</text>
  <text start="1303.46" dur="4.23">and writing their plans down and passing</text>
  <text start="1306.4" dur="4.98">them back and forth that would be</text>
  <text start="1307.69" dur="6.15">absolutely ridiculous any type of</text>
  <text start="1311.38" dur="5.61">advanced actor like they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1313.84" dur="4.41">convince us that Isis is which we know</text>
  <text start="1316.99" dur="2.7">is the proxy army of the United States</text>
  <text start="1318.25" dur="4.83">government central bankers but if we go</text>
  <text start="1319.69" dur="7.01">by their official story they will have</text>
  <text start="1323.08" dur="7.32">their own devices their own encryption</text>
  <text start="1326.7" dur="7.21">just like in the olden days when people</text>
  <text start="1330.4" dur="5.82">used to make up ciphers because it was</text>
  <text start="1333.91" dur="4.95">personal to them they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="1336.22" dur="4.56">use the off-the-shelf encryption it</text>
  <text start="1338.86" dur="3.81">wouldn&amp;#39;t make any sense because they</text>
  <text start="1340.78" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t know if someone has the method or</text>
  <text start="1342.67" dur="5.82">key so his argument is completely</text>
  <text start="1345.79" dur="6.39">ridiculous what he was really saying is</text>
  <text start="1348.49" dur="5.7">that he wants to spy on every American</text>
  <text start="1352.18" dur="4.44">and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve been pushing all</text>
  <text start="1354.19" dur="4.95">along and this is why each and every one</text>
  <text start="1356.62" dur="7.71">needs to continually reinforce your</text>
  <text start="1359.14" dur="7.74">rights any way you possibly can with</text>

  <text start="1394.37" dur="8.04">methods of protecting yourself and we</text>
  <text start="1399.74" dur="5.58">all need to continually push our rights</text>
