  <text start="105.06" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s not clear how this can be when part</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="7.13">of the economy that makes and moves real</text>
  <text start="110.01" dur="7.679">things continually shrinks US</text>
  <text start="114.95" dur="6.7">manufacturing has been contracting for</text>
  <text start="117.689" dur="6.151">the past year and we&amp;#39;ve been showing</text>
  <text start="121.65" dur="4.38">this through past reports we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="3.93">showing that the bowl to dry index has</text>
  <text start="126.03" dur="6.269">been declining which is the raw material</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="8.37">that factories use and we can see right</text>
  <text start="132.299" dur="6.03">now the trucking industry the railroad</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="4.74">industry you know these companies that</text>
  <text start="138.329" dur="5.75">move things around the country well</text>
  <text start="140.88" dur="6.419">guess what they&amp;#39;re falling apart too</text>
  <text start="144.079" dur="5.201">they&amp;#39;re in decline now one of the</text>
  <text start="147.299" dur="4.381">discrepancies between the overall growth</text>
  <text start="149.28" dur="4.79">and real stuff is that most of today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="5.16">economy is made up of services and</text>
  <text start="154.07" dur="4.24">they&amp;#39;re on the corporate media today</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="3.72">telling everyone that you know we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="158.31" dur="4.799">need manufacturing anymore it&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re service and industry but what is</text>
  <text start="163.109" dur="4.201">the service sector</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s mostly software restaurants banks</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="7.11">construction companies retailers doctors</text>
  <text start="170.52" dur="7.52">and hospitals can an economy thrive if</text>
  <text start="174.42" dur="6.42">it doesn&amp;#39;t make or move physical things</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="5.2">well the answer is no we we know this</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="3.99">because most of the services mentioned</text>
  <text start="183.24" dur="3.48">above either maintain the status quo</text>
  <text start="184.83" dur="8.75">like health care and restaurants or</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="11.01">houses and basically they&amp;#39;re consuming</text>
  <text start="193.58" dur="6.88">rather than building capital and this is</text>
  <text start="197.73" dur="6.42">why their whole entire meme will not</text>
  <text start="200.46" dur="7.22">work this is how we know the economy is</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="8.13">collapsing we have lost our</text>
  <text start="207.68" dur="8.47">manufacturing edge it isn&amp;#39;t it it&amp;#39;s in a</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="8.4">decline we are losing manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="8.25">we cannot maintain this country being in</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="9.06">being a service-oriented country it just</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="7.77">will not work and we&amp;#39;ve been showing</text>
  <text start="229.74" dur="6.45">this through everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="5.91">looking at and as we move forward we can</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="4.59">see that this economy continually</text>
  <text start="238.08" dur="4.83">declines doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the stock</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="4.02">market does it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what job</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="3.6">reports they put out there it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="244.8" dur="4.26">matter if they revised gdp three</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="5.46">thousand times that&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="4.56">change what&amp;#39;s really going on here and</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="6.03">what&amp;#39;s really going on is the economy is</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="7.47">collapsing and we know that Russia China</text>
  <text start="258" dur="5.49">many of the BRIC nations they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.09" dur="5.01">preparing for this this is why this</text>
  <text start="263.49" dur="6.84">system this alternate system was set up</text>
  <text start="266.1" dur="7.319">is it going to be a better system most</text>
  <text start="270.33" dur="5.01">likely not most likely the central</text>
  <text start="273.419" dur="4.051">bankers will get their teeth into it and</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="6.69">manipulate it the way they want it in</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="8.04">the end but they know that the dollar</text>
  <text start="282.03" dur="6.75">system is collapsing and we know that</text>
  <text start="285.51" dur="5.73">Russia and China they signed a mammoth</text>
  <text start="288.78" dur="6.09">30 year contract for Russian gas to</text>
  <text start="291.24" dur="6.3">China back in 2014 and we know that they</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="7.8">are going to exchange all of this in rem</text>
  <text start="297.54" dur="6.84">b and rubles not in dollars and this was</text>
  <text start="302.67" dur="4.92">the beginning of the accelerated process</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="6.45">of D dollarization but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="7.38">right now is since the u1 remember has</text>
  <text start="310.83" dur="7.08">been green-lighted to become a reserve</text>
  <text start="314.97" dur="5.7">currency there are clear signs right now</text>
  <text start="317.91" dur="5.1">showing that gold is to make a dramatic</text>
  <text start="320.67" dur="7.14">return to the world monetary stage</text>
  <text start="323.01" dur="7.05">Russia and China are decisively paving</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="5.7">the way for the world economy d</text>
  <text start="330.06" dur="6.21">dollarisation and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="333.51" dur="5.13">creating this alternative and right now</text>
  <text start="336.27" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s going to take the form of a goal</text>
  <text start="338.64" dur="7.53">back ruble and a goal back remember or</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="5.67">you want and this will start the</text>
  <text start="346.17" dur="4.85">snowball effect of the US dollar this is</text>
  <text start="348.75" dur="6.33">why Russia and China have been</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="6.19">accumulating so much gold this is why</text>
  <text start="355.08" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;ve been setting up their separate</text>
  <text start="357.21" dur="9.33">and apart gold exchange because the</text>
  <text start="362.22" dur="8.4">world will need stability and stability</text>
  <text start="366.54" dur="5.85">is a currency backed by gold this has</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="5.1">been done like this for thousands upon</text>
  <text start="372.39" dur="6.21">thousands of years and as the dollar</text>
  <text start="375.72" dur="6.06">dies everyone everything is going to be</text>
  <text start="378.6" dur="5.16">moving from west to east and the</text>
  <text start="381.78" dur="5.46">transition will not be that smooth</text>
  <text start="383.76" dur="5.97">because to make this transition it just</text>
  <text start="387.24" dur="4.8">can&amp;#39;t happen out in the open they need</text>
  <text start="389.73" dur="5.07">to have war to interrupt what is really</text>
  <text start="392.04" dur="5.67">going on with the dollar so after the</text>
  <text start="394.8" dur="7.53">war they can say okay let&amp;#39;s reset the</text>
  <text start="397.71" dur="8.73">system this is something new but really</text>
  <text start="402.33" dur="8.91">it&amp;#39;s the same stuff we&amp;#39;ve been doing now</text>
  <text start="406.44" dur="8.39">out in the UK we realize when private</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="8.76">west central bank countries decline</text>
  <text start="414.83" dur="7.99">collapse their business at this point is</text>
  <text start="420" dur="7.26">to disarm the people take control of the</text>
  <text start="422.82" dur="6.72">people and to spy on the people because</text>
  <text start="427.26" dur="4.25">the government powers are very nervous</text>
  <text start="429.54" dur="6.29">and we see this throughout his</text>
  <text start="431.51" dur="8.58">where many of the countries go down this</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="7.44">path and we see the UK right now France</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="5.22">and other nations they&amp;#39;re all in</text>
  <text start="443.27" dur="4.74">different areas but pushing this as hard</text>
  <text start="445.31" dur="4.14">as they possibly can and we know here in</text>
  <text start="448.01" dur="2.7">the United States they&amp;#39;re using the you</text>
  <text start="449.45" dur="4.05">know you see something say something</text>
  <text start="450.71" dur="5.61">what the UK is taking this a little bit</text>
  <text start="453.5" dur="5.22">further in a series of pamphlets</text>
  <text start="456.32" dur="4.8">circulating among local governments in</text>
  <text start="458.72" dur="4.74">the United Kingdom British parents are</text>
  <text start="461.12" dur="5.4">now being encouraged to spy on their own</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="7.53">children and to report any instances of</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="7.67">possible radicalization now it sounds</text>
  <text start="470.99" dur="6.39">great on the surface and it always does</text>
  <text start="474.19" dur="5.17">but the instructions that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="477.38" dur="5.16">putting out on how to spot a terrorist</text>
  <text start="479.36" dur="6.57">in your home is as follows there are</text>
  <text start="482.54" dur="6.57">three signs out of character changes in</text>

  <text start="508.67" dur="13.499">this my kids do this so what are they</text>
  <text start="515.96" dur="12.18">doing here they want the parents to spy</text>
  <text start="522.169" dur="8.901">on their own children and the other sign</text>
  <text start="528.14" dur="6.65">they&amp;#39;re saying is a mistrust in</text>
  <text start="531.07" dur="7.3">mainstream media reports and belief in</text>
  <text start="534.79" dur="6.37">conspiracy theories appearing angry</text>
  <text start="538.37" dur="7.26">about the government policies especially</text>
  <text start="541.16" dur="10.11">foreign policies questioning the</text>
  <text start="545.63" dur="8.16">government propaganda well we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="551.27" dur="4.02">allowed to question things anymore no</text>

  <text start="555.29" dur="6.72">government is telling us well this goes</text>
  <text start="559.04" dur="4.56">against everything so basically those</text>
  <text start="562.01" dur="3.54">people who are in line with the</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="5.28">government they&amp;#39;re fine</text>

  <text start="568.88" dur="4.86">website or youtube channel or twitter</text>
  <text start="571.7" dur="5.19">account or facebook account that is</text>
  <text start="573.74" dur="6.15">questioning the government this could be</text>
  <text start="576.89" dur="4.259">signs that they&amp;#39;re radicalized no this</text>
  <text start="579.89" dur="5.03">is signs that we&amp;#39;re calling the</text>
  <text start="581.149" dur="5.821">government&amp;#39;s out on their propaganda</text>
  <text start="584.92" dur="4.12">because if you really think about it and</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="4.59">we look at the united states the</text>
  <text start="589.04" dur="6.45">founding fathers they would have to be</text>
  <text start="591.56" dur="6.66">called terrorists men and women who are</text>

  <text start="768.47" dur="5.79">armored units at the border with Syria</text>
  <text start="770.75" dur="5.42">and the Syrian forces backed by Russia</text>
  <text start="774.26" dur="5.3">and Iran they&amp;#39;re gaining momentum</text>
  <text start="776.17" dur="7.35">they&amp;#39;re recapturing cities they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="779.56" dur="7.72">gaining a getting control of facilities</text>
  <text start="783.52" dur="6.73">which were held by militants the NATO</text>
  <text start="787.28" dur="5.36">allies they need a new plan right now</text>
  <text start="790.25" dur="5.64">and we can see a new one is forming</text>
  <text start="792.64" dur="6.67">because they need to hold the northern</text>
  <text start="795.89" dur="5.43">oil corridor from Iraq and try to take</text>
  <text start="799.31" dur="5.46">advantage of this opportunity to involve</text>
  <text start="801.32" dur="7.35">Russia in a long expensive war this is</text>
  <text start="804.77" dur="5.46">their plan right now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="808.67" dur="5.39">do what they were trying to do in</text>
  <text start="810.23" dur="6.54">Ukraine and it means that NATO</text>
  <text start="814.06" dur="5.86">contingent must occupy crucial</text>
  <text start="816.77" dur="7.44">infrastructure including oil fields</text>
  <text start="819.92" dur="8.52">before the Syrian government and their</text>
  <text start="824.21" dur="6.27">forces and Russia liberate them this is</text>
  <text start="828.44" dur="4.5">why we see all these troops coming right</text>
  <text start="830.48" dur="5.04">now into the country right now too</text>
  <text start="832.94" dur="7.38">guard and maintain this area now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="835.52" dur="7.86">a couple scenarios that this their plan</text>
  <text start="840.32" dur="5.31">entails the military buildup and</text>
  <text start="843.38" dur="5.51">escalation in the region could lead to</text>
  <text start="845.63" dur="7.8">open military conflict between NATO and</text>
  <text start="848.89" dur="6.4">Russia this regional conflict could lead</text>
  <text start="853.43" dur="4.29">to a global war which we can see right</text>
  <text start="855.29" dur="4.62">now is on the drawing board because they</text>
  <text start="857.72" dur="3.84">know they need a war to cover up this</text>
  <text start="859.91" dur="4.77">entire economic collapse and this is</text>
  <text start="861.56" dur="5.22">where they&amp;#39;re really headed Syria they</text>
  <text start="864.68" dur="3.21">might divide it and we know and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="866.78" dur="3.03">been talking about this for quite a</text>
  <text start="867.89" dur="4.95">while where they might set up these safe</text>
  <text start="869.81" dur="8.22">zones and say okay this area right here</text>
  <text start="872.84" dur="9.54">is separate and apart from Syria and we</text>
  <text start="878.03" dur="6.54">can see the first scenario is most</text>
  <text start="882.38" dur="4.43">likely going to happen here where</text>
  <text start="884.57" dur="6.69">there&amp;#39;s going to be a conflict between</text>
  <text start="886.81" dur="6.1">Russia and the NATO allied forces and we</text>
  <text start="891.26" dur="4.41">can see as more and more troops of being</text>
  <text start="892.91" dur="3.99">brought into this area as they try here</text>
  <text start="895.67" dur="3.96">in the United States to push the</text>
  <text start="896.9" dur="5.7">authorization for war things are just</text>
  <text start="899.63" dur="5.31">going to escalate at this point Germany</text>
  <text start="902.6" dur="4.86">wants to bring in Special Forces to back</text>
  <text start="904.94" dur="5.37">up their units they want to bring in</text>
  <text start="907.46" dur="5.76">elite commandos just in case of an</text>
  <text start="910.31" dur="4.23">emergency they say so we can see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="913.22" dur="3.63">happening right now it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="914.54" dur="5.3">build up they&amp;#39;ve changed plant at that</text>
  <text start="916.85" dur="4.86">they change plans the tactics is is</text>
  <text start="919.84" dur="5.65">changing a little bit but the goal is</text>
  <text start="921.71" dur="10.1">always the same to get Assad to start</text>
  <text start="925.49" dur="8.61">war if they can&amp;#39;t now I mentioned that</text>
  <text start="931.81" dur="3.76">Ashton Carter was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="934.1" dur="4.32">he had their opening up all positions</text>
  <text start="935.57" dur="4.62">for women to go into combat roles and</text>
  <text start="938.42" dur="4.71">everyone of course is saying this is a</text>
  <text start="940.19" dur="5.04">fantastic idea you know it should be</text>
  <text start="943.13" dur="4.62">equal men women they should go into</text>
  <text start="945.23" dur="5.43">combat roles and it sounds good on the</text>
  <text start="947.75" dur="7.41">surface but there&amp;#39;s an there&amp;#39;s always an</text>
  <text start="950.66" dur="7.2">underlying agenda in this and if we look</text>
  <text start="955.16" dur="6.12">back in time to 1981 there was a US</text>
  <text start="957.86" dur="7.79">Supreme Court ruling excluding women</text>
  <text start="961.28" dur="4.37">from the draft and</text>
  <text start="966.03" dur="5.37">reason why they can do this it was</text>
  <text start="968.16" dur="6.78">because women were excluded from combat</text>
  <text start="971.4" dur="6.08">roles so let&amp;#39;s think about what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="974.94" dur="8.16">doing right now is this the best</text>
  <text start="977.48" dur="7.87">interest to for the people to include</text>
  <text start="983.1" dur="4.86">them in all combat roles is this really</text>
  <text start="985.35" dur="6.03">what they&amp;#39;re doing or are they saying</text>
  <text start="987.96" dur="7.11">okay the combat roles are open now now</text>
  <text start="991.38" dur="8.58">we can draft the women and this is what</text>
  <text start="995.07" dur="8.49">they&amp;#39;re doing if this goes through like</text>
  <text start="999.96" dur="7.68">it is right now all women turning the</text>
  <text start="1003.56" dur="8.9">age of 18 will have to register just</text>
  <text start="1007.64" dur="9.06">like men to be drafted into the military</text>
  <text start="1012.46" dur="7.06">this is their plan and you say why why</text>
  <text start="1016.7" dur="5.55">would they want to do this now they want</text>
  <text start="1019.52" dur="9.77">to do this now because we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="1022.25" dur="11.7">into war that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re doing it and</text>
  <text start="1029.29" dur="8.53">it&amp;#39;s moving faster and faster because</text>
  <text start="1033.95" dur="6.27">the economy is collapsing listen</text>
