  <text start="82.13" dur="5.67">two terms up until now and we pick them</text>
  <text start="85.46" dur="4.32">apart we understand they don&amp;#39;t count</text>
  <text start="87.8" dur="3.569">those people that have fallen off those</text>
  <text start="89.78" dur="4.89">people who haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview</text>

  <text start="117.92" dur="3.96">been remember we have two things</text>
  <text start="120.02" dur="3.84">happening at this point we have Trump</text>

  <text start="134.209" dur="2.521">nothing to do with the stock market</text>
  <text start="135.14" dur="4.11">these job numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="136.73" dur="4.259">manipulated remember Obama&amp;#39;s people are</text>
  <text start="139.25" dur="4.32">still within the government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="140.989" dur="4.651">still manipulating and all these</text>
  <text start="143.57" dur="4.02">manufacturing jobs they didn&amp;#39;t come back</text>
  <text start="145.64" dur="4.08">to the United States no manufacturing</text>
  <text start="147.59" dur="4.41">jobs really came back soon as you became</text>
  <text start="149.72" dur="6.09">president I mean a lot of promises and</text>
  <text start="152" dur="7.32">all of this is done for what is coming</text>
  <text start="155.81" dur="4.769">after the entire system collapses but</text>
  <text start="159.32" dur="3.479">when we look at these job numbers</text>
  <text start="160.579" dur="3.391">they&amp;#39;re very interesting we see that</text>
  <text start="162.799" dur="3.181">there&amp;#39;s a hundred and thirty-eight</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="3.72">thousand jobs that were added this was</text>
  <text start="165.98" dur="3.18">far below what they expected they</text>
  <text start="167.69" dur="4.74">thought it was gonna be around 185</text>
  <text start="169.16" dur="6.329">thousand April well yes that was revised</text>
  <text start="172.43" dur="4.619">and it was revised from two hundred</text>
  <text start="175.489" dur="4.951">eleven thousand down to one hundred and</text>
  <text start="177.049" dur="5.611">seventy four thousand and the Fed maybe</text>
  <text start="180.44" dur="4.71">they have the evidence they need to</text>
  <text start="182.66" dur="2.73">raise the interest rates because think</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="2.64">about</text>
  <text start="185.39" dur="5.28">the unemployment rate dropped to four</text>
  <text start="187.79" dur="4.8">point three percent and the economy</text>
  <text start="190.67" dur="5.09">looks fantastic at this point but</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="6.81">manufacturing jobs they decline sharply</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="6.1">posting the weakest growth of 2017 and</text>
  <text start="199.4" dur="4.559">if we look at the household survey it</text>
  <text start="201.86" dur="4.62">revealed an even uglier picture as a</text>
  <text start="203.959" dur="4.681">number of employed workers declined by</text>
  <text start="206.48" dur="3.33">two hundred and thirty three thousand to</text>
  <text start="208.64" dur="2.61">one hundred fifty two thousand nine</text>
  <text start="209.81" dur="4.77">hundred twenty-three the lowest since</text>
  <text start="211.25" dur="7.56">March now there was something that was</text>
  <text start="214.58" dur="6.09">positive in this jobs report we saw that</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="3.78">the unemployment rate well it dropped</text>
  <text start="220.67" dur="3.84">from four point four percent to four</text>
  <text start="222.59" dur="4.649">point three percent which we know is</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="4.08">completely manipulated because when we</text>
  <text start="227.239" dur="4.711">look at the labor force participation</text>
  <text start="228.59" dur="6.59">rate what happened to that it one from</text>
  <text start="231.95" dur="7.14">sixty nine point nine percent to 62.7%</text>
  <text start="235.18" dur="8.98">six hundred and eight thousand Americans</text>
  <text start="239.09" dur="7.53">left the job market there are now ninety</text>
  <text start="244.16" dur="5.669">four point nine eight three million</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="6.589">people who are completely out of the job</text>
  <text start="249.829" dur="6.66">market and we know why this is happening</text>
  <text start="253.209" dur="5.46">full-time job corporate jobs people are</text>
  <text start="256.489" dur="4.981">getting laid off the retail industry</text>
  <text start="258.669" dur="6.431">well it&amp;#39;s a complete apocalypse</text>
  <text start="261.47" dur="6.06">part-time and full-time jobs everyone is</text>
  <text start="265.1" dur="6.18">losing them and when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="267.53" dur="7.65">can see in May the u.s. lost three</text>
  <text start="271.28" dur="7.139">hundred and sixty thousand full-time</text>
  <text start="275.18" dur="6.45">jobs and there were a hundred and thirty</text>
  <text start="278.419" dur="6.691">three thousand part-time jobs added and</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="6.659">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this happen all along</text>
  <text start="285.11" dur="5.91">now putting this number into context it</text>
  <text start="288.289" dur="5.161">was the biggest drop in full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="291.02" dur="5.67">going back to June 2014</text>
  <text start="293.45" dur="4.95">now all those manufacturing jobs that</text>
  <text start="296.69" dur="3.78">were supposed to coming back to the</text>
  <text start="298.4" dur="3.93">United States where Trump continually</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="4.58">put this on his Twitter feed you know</text>
  <text start="302.33" dur="6.209">10,000 jobs 5,000 jobs well</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="5.35">manufacturing declined by a thousand the</text>
  <text start="308.539" dur="4.141">waiter and bartender recovery while that</text>
  <text start="310.4" dur="4.62">continues there were 30,000 workers</text>
  <text start="312.68" dur="6.93">added in the food and services and drink</text>
  <text start="315.02" dur="6.63">places so where were the jobs well 47</text>
  <text start="319.61" dur="4.26">and jobs were in the leisure and</text>
  <text start="321.65" dur="4.799">hospitality section we know there were</text>
  <text start="323.87" dur="7.65">30,000 jobs added to the food services</text>
  <text start="326.449" dur="8.601">we see that there were 12,000 900 jobs</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="5.79">that were in the temp help service and</text>
  <text start="335.05" dur="4.41">when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="4.199">most of the jobs they were all these</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="5.41">low-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="341.509" dur="6.481">there weren&amp;#39;t high-paying fantastic jobs</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="5.19">that were really added and we can see</text>
  <text start="347.99" dur="4.049">right now that basically what is</text>
  <text start="350.06" dur="4.789">happening at this point is that the</text>
  <text start="352.039" dur="7.051">part-time waiter and bartender recovery</text>
  <text start="354.849" dur="6.1">continues nothing has changed at all we</text>
  <text start="359.09" dur="5.639">are looking at the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="360.949" dur="6.391">think about it since 2014 we have added</text>
  <text start="364.729" dur="5.581">eight hundred and sixteen thousand food</text>
  <text start="367.34" dur="5.759">service and drink placed jobs port time</text>
  <text start="370.31" dur="5.599">jobs during the same period we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="373.099" dur="5.611">created one hundred and seven thousand</text>
  <text start="375.909" dur="5.201">manufacturing jobs because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="378.71" dur="5.19">losing a lot of manufacturing some has</text>
  <text start="381.11" dur="4.109">come back then we lost some more and we</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="3.09">can see that the cycle</text>
  <text start="385.219" dur="5.371">well it&amp;#39;s getting us absolutely nowhere</text>
  <text start="386.99" dur="4.919">and the manufacturing jobs most likely</text>
  <text start="390.59" dur="3.419">is going to get worse because what is</text>
  <text start="391.909" dur="5.13">happening now in the automobile industry</text>
  <text start="394.009" dur="5.37">which is a huge chunk of the</text>
  <text start="397.039" dur="5.84">manufacturing well things aren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="399.379" dur="7.141">too well for the fifth straight month</text>
  <text start="402.879" dur="6.85">overall auto sales declined again the</text>
  <text start="406.52" dur="6.389">domestic light vehicles their sales were</text>
  <text start="409.729" dur="5.641">down and these are the lowest sales</text>
  <text start="412.909" dur="5.491">numbers going back more than three years</text>
  <text start="415.37" dur="5.669">so GM is having a lot of problems we</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="4.979">know that Ford&amp;#39;s fleet numbers they are</text>
  <text start="421.039" dur="4.56">down by 15 so this is the worst</text>
  <text start="423.379" dur="5.611">six-month drop in domestic light</text>
  <text start="425.599" dur="6.18">vehicles going back to the depth of the</text>
  <text start="428.99" dur="5.579">financial crisis the industry wide</text>
  <text start="431.779" dur="4.44">selling rate including imports slipped</text>
  <text start="434.569" dur="3.66">in May to about sixteen point eight</text>
  <text start="436.219" dur="4.41">million light vehicles compared with</text>
  <text start="438.229" dur="4.5">seventeen point two million a year ago</text>
  <text start="440.629" dur="5.581">this would mark the third straight month</text>
  <text start="442.729" dur="6.03">of a sales pace short of seventeen</text>
  <text start="446.21" dur="4.739">million vehicles and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="448.759" dur="4.271">right now is that we discussed this</text>
  <text start="450.949" dur="5.231">yesterday the lot they are</text>
  <text start="453.03" dur="5.34">so over stuff right now they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="456.18" dur="4.8">the individuals to go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="458.37" dur="6.12">these vehicles so what did they do they</text>
  <text start="460.98" dur="6.09">change the credit rules where now those</text>
  <text start="464.49" dur="5.37">people who are subprime subprime</text>
  <text start="467.07" dur="6.09">subprime they will have the ability to</text>
  <text start="469.86" dur="4.83">go purchase things using their credit</text>
  <text start="473.16" dur="3.84">now they did this on purpose because</text>
  <text start="474.69" dur="4.71">they realize they&amp;#39;re running out of</text>
  <text start="477" dur="5.79">individuals and they need to find these</text>
  <text start="479.4" dur="6.66">people now from all of this happening we</text>
  <text start="482.79" dur="6.72">see that the Atlanta GDP now they have</text>
  <text start="486.06" dur="5.1">raised their GDP number to four percent</text>
  <text start="489.51" dur="4.55">which makes no sense whatsoever because</text>
  <text start="491.16" dur="6.66">remember construction spending that has</text>
  <text start="494.06" dur="6.49">declined Motor Vehicles sales that has</text>
  <text start="497.82" dur="5.49">declined April durable good shipments</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="6.15">were down by 0.3% wholesale inventories</text>
  <text start="503.31" dur="6.03">were down by 0.3 percent the Dre the</text>
  <text start="506.7" dur="5.16">trade deficit in April widened by 3.8</text>
  <text start="509.34" dur="4.8">percent tax receipts they are down new</text>
  <text start="511.86" dur="5.88">home sales existing home sales pending</text>
  <text start="514.14" dur="7.44">home sales all down actually new home</text>
  <text start="517.74" dur="6.86">sales down by 11.4% Empire State</text>
  <text start="521.58" dur="5.82">manufacturing has turned negative and</text>
  <text start="524.6" dur="6.28">retail that is just a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="527.4" dur="7.05">so when they look at the economy you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.88" dur="6.24">really thinking that this is a 4% GDP</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="6.54">economy they&amp;#39;re out of their minds</text>
  <text start="537.12" dur="6.27">there&amp;#39;s no way actually when we look</text>
  <text start="540.99" dur="5.25">back in time and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking the</text>
  <text start="543.39" dur="6.3">economy for quite a while the numbers</text>
  <text start="546.24" dur="6">that are coming out now are the worst</text>
  <text start="549.69" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;ve pretty much seen since the Great</text>
  <text start="552.24" dur="5.19">Recession and some of these numbers are</text>
  <text start="553.68" dur="7.2">even below that which tells us that the</text>
  <text start="557.43" dur="6.57">manipulation right now is off the charts</text>
  <text start="560.88" dur="4.65">now we know that gold and silver they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="564" dur="4.17">been manipulated and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="565.53" dur="5.42">manipulated for a very long time and we</text>
  <text start="568.17" dur="5.1">can see right now that through all these</text>
  <text start="570.95" dur="3.64">conspiracy theories where people are</text>
  <text start="573.27" dur="2.67">saying yes gold and silver was</text>
  <text start="574.59" dur="3.39">manipulated and people said you&amp;#39;re crazy</text>
  <text start="575.94" dur="4.65">who would do this nobody would</text>
  <text start="577.98" dur="5.88">manipulate it well it turns out that yes</text>
  <text start="580.59" dur="6.21">a Deutsche Bank trader well finally</text>
  <text start="583.86" dur="4.89">admitted finally confirmed that</text>
  <text start="586.8" dur="5.4">yes the biggest banks in the world have</text>
  <text start="588.75" dur="6.3">conspired to rig precious metal market</text>
  <text start="592.2" dur="5.37">the Deutsche Bank trader David Lee you</text>
  <text start="595.05" dur="6.599">plated pleaded guilty in federal court</text>
  <text start="597.57" dur="8.34">in Chicago where he spoofed gold silver</text>
  <text start="601.649" dur="7.141">platinum and palladium futures now he</text>
  <text start="605.91" dur="6.78">knowingly and intentionally did this</text>
  <text start="608.79" dur="6.69">with other precious metal traders they</text>
  <text start="612.69" dur="5.82">work together to do this and what he did</text>
  <text start="615.48" dur="5.91">was he spoofed orders and it looked like</text>
  <text start="618.51" dur="4.59">people were buying then he would under a</text>
  <text start="621.39" dur="3.33">Stowe&amp;#39;s orders and he would make it look</text>
  <text start="623.1" dur="4.5">like there was you know there was demand</text>
  <text start="624.72" dur="5.58">there was no demand and they did this to</text>
  <text start="627.6" dur="4.62">adjust the prices and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="630.3" dur="6.02">instant messaging texts that went back</text>
  <text start="632.22" dur="7.65">and forth but this is just the outlier</text>
  <text start="636.32" dur="6.88">rigging of the precious metals this is</text>
  <text start="639.87" dur="6.6">the outlier manipulation the real</text>
  <text start="643.2" dur="6.9">manipulation is with the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="646.47" dur="6.33">with the central bank they are where</text>
  <text start="650.1" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s the heart of it this whole thing</text>
  <text start="652.8" dur="5.039">is yes they needed some of the banks to</text>
  <text start="655.14" dur="4.56">help out and these individuals were told</text>
  <text start="657.839" dur="4.591">this is what we need to do and they all</text>
  <text start="659.7" dur="5">work with each other to do this so we</text>
  <text start="662.43" dur="4.74">can see that yes precious metals were</text>
  <text start="664.7" dur="5.829">manipulated but the real manipulation</text>
  <text start="667.17" dur="7.44">right now is still being done it has not</text>
  <text start="670.529" dur="8.391">ended whatsoever now out in Spain we see</text>
  <text start="674.61" dur="6.9">that Spain 6 largest bank well it is</text>
  <text start="678.92" dur="5.979">imploding on itself it&amp;#39;s in freefall</text>
  <text start="681.51" dur="7.11">right now and it looks like the bank it</text>
  <text start="684.899" dur="6.901">might need to be liquidated unless there</text>
  <text start="688.62" dur="6.45">is a last-minute buyer and this is banco</text>
  <text start="691.8" dur="5.13">popular and it is crass as much as 27</text>
  <text start="695.07" dur="5.25">percent the biggest intraday drop since</text>
  <text start="696.93" dur="5.61">1989 and the European banking watchdog</text>
  <text start="700.32" dur="4.86">the single resolution board warned</text>
  <text start="702.54" dur="5.58">European Union officials that popular</text>
  <text start="705.18" dur="5.82">may need to be liquidated or bailed in</text>
  <text start="708.12" dur="5.7">if they cannot find a buyer and right</text>
  <text start="711" dur="6.39">now it looks like nobody wants to pick</text>
  <text start="713.82" dur="6.82">up the 37 billion euros of soured</text>
  <text start="717.39" dur="5.71">property loan and it looks like there is</text>
  <text start="720.64" dur="4.02">a huge problem now this might start a</text>
  <text start="723.1" dur="2.82">chain reaction but I don&amp;#39;t think the</text>
  <text start="724.66" dur="3.06">central bank is just going to let it go</text>
  <text start="725.92" dur="2.85">I think they&amp;#39;re going to do some</text>
  <text start="727.72" dur="5.22">manipulation</text>
  <text start="728.77" dur="6.99">maybe they&amp;#39;ll push a bail out or maybe</text>
  <text start="732.94" dur="5.37">they will do a bail in but this is going</text>
  <text start="735.76" dur="3.72">to be a problem at this point because</text>
  <text start="738.31" dur="2.58">the rest of the world is going to look</text>
  <text start="739.48" dur="3.3">at this and say well wait a minute</text>

  <text start="744.52" dur="4.83">those funds people around the world will</text>
  <text start="747.61" dur="5.25">look at this and say maybe I should take</text>
  <text start="749.35" dur="4.71">my funds out of the banking system and</text>
  <text start="752.86" dur="3.48">they don&amp;#39;t want that to happen because</text>
  <text start="754.06" dur="5.52">they experienced this already in Greece</text>
  <text start="756.34" dur="5.64">and we can see that most likely they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="759.58" dur="3.99">do something to manipulate this they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="761.98" dur="3.78">do something to save the bank they</text>
  <text start="763.57" dur="4.41">always do this but eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
