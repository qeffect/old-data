  <text start="62.67" dur="4.89">August 20th 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="65.4" dur="6.12">episode is two sides fight for control</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="6.12">we are coming down to the wire let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.52" dur="4.47">into the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="73.68" dur="5.7">geopolitical news now as we can see</text>
  <text start="75.99" dur="5.01">Steve Bannon well he has been removed</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="2.94">from the White House there are some</text>
  <text start="81" dur="3.21">saying that he&amp;#39;s fired others saying</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="4.95">that he resigned about two weeks ago and</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="6.66">this could be all part of Trump strategy</text>
  <text start="87.27" dur="5.07">or we might see a lot of problems in his</text>
  <text start="90.87" dur="2.88">administration now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="92.34" dur="3.75">interesting is the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="3.99">out there saying that you know the Trump</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="5.04">presidency that we fought for is</text>
  <text start="97.74" dur="5.76">completely over and Steve Bannon right</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="4.29">now is saying that everything that Trump</text>
  <text start="103.5" dur="4.02">has been trying to do there are certain</text>
  <text start="105.42" dur="4.32">forces within government that has been</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="4.94">stopping him and he&amp;#39;s saying now he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="7.68">a position to go for full force and</text>
  <text start="112.46" dur="6.61">fight or go to war for Trump and we can</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="4.8">see at this point this might be a</text>
  <text start="119.07" dur="5.37">strategy which Bannon and Trump came up</text>
  <text start="122.22" dur="4.47">with because now he has the ability to</text>
  <text start="124.44" dur="3.66">call out certain individuals he has the</text>
  <text start="126.69" dur="3.15">ability to work with the news</text>
  <text start="128.1" dur="6.03">organization he joined up back up with</text>
  <text start="129.84" dur="7.47">Breitbart to push the agenda of fighting</text>
  <text start="134.13" dur="4.71">against those people who are not elected</text>
  <text start="137.31" dur="3.54">those people who were in the background</text>
  <text start="138.84" dur="5.93">those people who are trying to change</text>
  <text start="140.85" dur="7.74">everything and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="144.77" dur="7.45">he is pushing the idea that he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="148.59" dur="5.37">to be calling a lot of people out on the</text>
  <text start="152.22" dur="3.81">carpet here and he&amp;#39;s going to be saying</text>
  <text start="153.96" dur="3.9">listen this is what&amp;#39;s been going on and</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="3.66">he went on to say that if there is any</text>
  <text start="157.86" dur="4.23">confusion out there let me clear it up</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="4.71">I&amp;#39;m leaving the White House and going to</text>
  <text start="162.09" dur="4.74">war for Trump against his opponents on</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="5.16">Capitol Hill in the media and in</text>
  <text start="166.83" dur="5.34">corporate America we got to do this the</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="5.28">president&amp;#39;s default position is to do it</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="6.149">but the apparatus is going crazy don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="174.84" dur="6.39">get me wrong it&amp;#39;s like every day and we</text>
  <text start="178.319" dur="4.581">can see right now he&amp;#39;s pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="181.23" dur="4.65">that they&amp;#39;re going to go full force</text>
  <text start="182.9" dur="4.419">trying to do this now we&amp;#39;re at we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="4.559">this situation</text>
  <text start="187.319" dur="4.801">where we have both sides and they are</text>
  <text start="190.439" dur="5.461">battling it out right now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="6.089">fierce battle going on with who controls</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="3.419">the country right now now we have the</text>
  <text start="198.209" dur="3.661">corporate media which is the mouthpiece</text>
  <text start="199.319" dur="5.101">for the deep state elite the Kabala and</text>
  <text start="201.87" dur="4.47">then we have the other individuals who</text>
  <text start="204.42" dur="4.2">are fighting against us now remember</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="4.19">Trump not really part of the Republicans</text>
  <text start="208.62" dur="5.22">not really part of the Democrats and</text>
  <text start="210.53" dur="5.769">he&amp;#39;s trying to basically push a</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="4.56">different agenda than what the cabal</text>
  <text start="216.299" dur="3.511">actually wants and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="218.4" dur="3.509">interesting is the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="219.81" dur="3.659">out there and you can see from what</text>
  <text start="221.909" dur="3.03">happened in Charles Ville where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.469" dur="2.821">pushing the idea that you know we need</text>
  <text start="224.939" dur="2.791">to get rid of the Confederate flag we</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="3.36">need to get rid of all the statues and</text>
  <text start="227.73" dur="4.83">NPR in PBS</text>
  <text start="229.65" dur="4.669">well they teamed up with Maris to poll</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="5.22">Americans on their views of historic</text>
  <text start="234.319" dur="5.98">Confederate monuments and I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="237.78" dur="4.169">they really expected the polls to come</text>
  <text start="240.299" dur="3.931">back the way they did and they tried to</text>
  <text start="241.949" dur="6.51">manipulate him a little bit but it was</text>
  <text start="244.23" dur="6.479">overwhelmingly to keep the statues now</text>
  <text start="248.459" dur="4.68">they did this poll and the question read</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="4.411">do you think statues honoring leaders of</text>
  <text start="253.139" dur="4.261">the Confederacy should remain as</text>
  <text start="255.12" dur="5.13">historical symbols be removed because</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re offensive now 62% said they</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="6.78">should remain 27% said they should be</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="6.359">removed and they didn&amp;#39;t expect this to</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="5.4">happen they didn&amp;#39;t realize that at once</text>
  <text start="270.449" dur="4.291">again how the American people are</text>
  <text start="272.43" dur="5.43">actually thinking now Condoleezza Rice</text>
  <text start="274.74" dur="5.88">was out there and she was saying that we</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="6">should keep the statues because this is</text>
  <text start="280.62" dur="5.789">part of American history this gives us a</text>
  <text start="283.86" dur="5.46">story and it points to what happened so</text>
  <text start="286.409" dur="5.79">we never repeat it once again and I</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="6.42">completely agree with her but of course</text>
  <text start="292.199" dur="6.631">the elite the Cabal the corporate media</text>
  <text start="295.74" dur="5.399">they&amp;#39;re pushing a certain agenda and</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="4.559">they&amp;#39;re pushing it very very hard to</text>
  <text start="301.139" dur="5.191">convince the people and to actually</text>
  <text start="303.389" dur="6.15">separate the people because their whole</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="4.8">approach is conquer and divide this is</text>
  <text start="309.539" dur="3.81">why the people need to stop fighting</text>
  <text start="311.13" dur="4.289">each other and come together and I know</text>
  <text start="313.349" dur="3.991">this is a very difficult thing to do but</text>
  <text start="315.419" dur="4.05">this is what need this what this is what</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="3.36">needs to happen we need to come together</text>
  <text start="319.469" dur="4.291">and</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="5.79">work together and find out who is the</text>
  <text start="323.76" dur="4.8">true enemy why are they doing this how</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="4.23">can we get rid of them and who in</text>
  <text start="328.56" dur="6">government is actually working for the</text>
  <text start="330.72" dur="6.75">people now we know going back many</text>
  <text start="334.56" dur="6.09">months Trump laid out this entire</text>
  <text start="337.47" dur="6.47">framework to go after voter voter fraud</text>
  <text start="340.65" dur="6.81">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="4.2">according to a new study of US census</text>
  <text start="347.46" dur="3.72">data</text>
  <text start="348.14" dur="6.88">America has more registered voters than</text>
  <text start="351.18" dur="6.63">actual live voters now this is kind of</text>
  <text start="355.02" dur="5.37">troubling because when you look at it</text>
  <text start="357.81" dur="5.01">how can this be now the data it comes</text>
  <text start="360.39" dur="5.4">from judicial watch&amp;#39;s election integrity</text>
  <text start="362.82" dur="5.4">project the group looked at data from</text>
  <text start="365.79" dur="7.43">2011 to 2015 produced by the US Census</text>
  <text start="368.22" dur="8.37">Bureau and they found that yet there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.22" dur="6.76">anomalies in the data now as reported by</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="6.03">the National reviews Deroy Murdock who</text>
  <text start="379.98" dur="6.62">did some number crunching of his own</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="7.41">some 3.5 million more people are</text>
  <text start="386.6" dur="7.03">registered to vote in the u.s. than are</text>
  <text start="390.03" dur="6.57">alive among American adult citizens such</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="5.6">staggering inaccuracy is an engraved</text>
  <text start="396.6" dur="5.34">invitation to voter fraud now Murdock</text>
  <text start="399.23" dur="6.82">counted judicial watches state by state</text>
  <text start="401.94" dur="7.05">tally and found that 462 US counties had</text>
  <text start="406.05" dur="5.82">a registration rate exceeding 100% of</text>
  <text start="408.99" dur="5.4">all eligible voters that&amp;#39;s three point</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="3">five five two million people who Murdock</text>
  <text start="414.39" dur="3.36">calls</text>
  <text start="414.87" dur="5.52">ghost voters and how many people is that</text>
  <text start="417.75" dur="5.19">well there are 21 states that don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="420.39" dur="4.89">that many people now California for</text>
  <text start="422.94" dur="6.09">instance has 11 counties with more</text>
  <text start="425.28" dur="7.95">registered voters than actual voters now</text>
  <text start="429.03" dur="7.41">to me this tells us that there is voter</text>
  <text start="433.23" dur="5.97">fraud something is wrong with our system</text>
  <text start="436.44" dur="5.4">and this is something they don&amp;#39;t want us</text>
  <text start="439.2" dur="6.06">to know this is why they&amp;#39;re fighting so</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="6.39">hard against looking into voter</text>
  <text start="445.26" dur="4.8">registration they don&amp;#39;t want anyone to</text>
  <text start="448.23" dur="4.08">figure what they&amp;#39;ve been doing over the</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="4.38">many many years now</text>
  <text start="452.31" dur="5.94">humph is reviewing options for</text>
  <text start="454.44" dur="4.71">Afghanistan he&amp;#39;s at Camp David and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.25" dur="2.73">saying that he&amp;#39;s meeting with the</text>
  <text start="459.15" dur="4.77">generals we don&amp;#39;t know exactly what the</text>
  <text start="460.98" dur="4.98">strategy is going to be for Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="463.92" dur="3.48">and we know that the Taliban Russia</text>
  <text start="465.96" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re saying that you know the United</text>
  <text start="467.4" dur="3.9">States should leave Afghanistan I do</text>
  <text start="469.32" dur="3.57">believe that the soldier should leave</text>
  <text start="471.3" dur="3.39">Afghanistan there&amp;#39;s no reason for the</text>
  <text start="472.89" dur="3.42">United States to be there except for the</text>
  <text start="474.69" dur="3.81">intelligence agencies where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="5.67">protecting the poppy fields protecting</text>
  <text start="478.5" dur="5.52">certain assets within Afghanistan that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.98" dur="3.75">why they want to stay but for the people</text>
  <text start="484.02" dur="6.12">of the United States there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="485.73" dur="6.29">to take our children our loved ones and</text>
  <text start="490.14" dur="5.4">send them over there to fight for</text>
  <text start="492.02" dur="6.55">something else than what is really being</text>
  <text start="495.54" dur="5.94">reported to the American people we see</text>
  <text start="498.57" dur="5.1">that there has been a reduction in the</text>
  <text start="501.48" dur="4.8">amount of US troops taking part in the</text>
  <text start="503.67" dur="6.15">joint exercise with South Korean forces</text>
  <text start="506.28" dur="6.87">this year now last year 25,000 soldiers</text>
  <text start="509.82" dur="7.02">took part of this exercise that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="513.15" dur="8.67">on right now now it&amp;#39;s only 17,500 is</text>
  <text start="516.84" dur="7.47">this a sign a subtle sign to North Korea</text>
  <text start="521.82" dur="6.27">saying listen we&amp;#39;re scaling back and</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="6.12">we&amp;#39;re not using as many troops to show</text>
  <text start="528.09" dur="4.29">that yes we are ready for talks now</text>
  <text start="530.43" dur="3.66">madness is out there saying you know</text>
  <text start="532.38" dur="3.39">this is all part of the training and</text>
  <text start="534.09" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re using less soldiers but I</text>
  <text start="535.77" dur="5.22">personally think that they&amp;#39;re scaling it</text>
  <text start="537.75" dur="5.61">back to show that listen we want to have</text>
  <text start="540.99" dur="3.84">talks this way the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="543.36" dur="2.94">not out there saying oh my god look</text>
  <text start="544.83" dur="3.36">what&amp;#39;s going on here they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="546.3" dur="3.87">actually the opposite of what we want we</text>
  <text start="548.19" dur="3.84">want to go to war with North Korea we</text>
  <text start="550.17" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t want to have diplomacy because</text>
  <text start="552.03" dur="5.22">remember the elite the deep state the</text>
  <text start="553.56" dur="6.84">Cabal they want war with North Korea</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="5.58">now the Islamic state they are in a huge</text>
  <text start="560.4" dur="6.39">amount of trouble we see right now that</text>
  <text start="562.83" dur="5.01">Syria well they are trapping the Islamic</text>
  <text start="566.79" dur="3.57">state they have ins they have them</text>
  <text start="567.84" dur="4.62">encircled they&amp;#39;ve been shutting off many</text>
  <text start="570.36" dur="4.59">different roadways where they were</text>
  <text start="572.46" dur="5.34">getting supplies and they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="574.95" dur="4.74">cut off right now and right now the</text>
  <text start="577.8" dur="5.1">Islamic state fighters they are</text>
  <text start="579.69" dur="6.27">surrounded and they have absolutely no</text>
  <text start="582.9" dur="6.66">place to go and it looks like it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="585.96" dur="6.36">maybe days weeks or months where these</text>
  <text start="589.56" dur="5.63">terrorist groups their days are numbered</text>
  <text start="592.32" dur="5.19">right now now it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="595.19" dur="4.06">during the Obama administration they</text>
  <text start="597.51" dur="3.36">kept saying that the war in Syria is</text>
  <text start="599.25" dur="3.27">going to be going on forever in Iraq</text>
  <text start="600.87" dur="3.21">it&amp;#39;s going to be going on forever we</text>
  <text start="602.52" dur="2.55">can&amp;#39;t destroy the Islamic state it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="604.08" dur="2.879">completely impossible</text>
  <text start="605.07" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s going to be years and years and</text>
  <text start="606.959" dur="4.771">years and we&amp;#39;re never leaving these two</text>
  <text start="609.3" dur="4.68">areas because the Islamic state they are</text>
  <text start="611.73" dur="4.65">just too powerful for the United States</text>
  <text start="613.98" dur="3.78">and we know that the Islamic state al</text>
  <text start="616.38" dur="2.61">Qaeda and all the rest they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="617.76" dur="3.269">created by the United States the</text>
  <text start="618.99" dur="7.74">coalition forces Israel they&amp;#39;re all part</text>
  <text start="621.029" dur="8.461">of it now with the disintegration of</text>
  <text start="626.73" dur="5.04">these terrorist groups where Russia and</text>
  <text start="629.49" dur="5.34">Syria they&amp;#39;re winning the battle winning</text>
  <text start="631.77" dur="5.58">the war in Syria Iraq basically</text>
  <text start="634.83" dur="6.33">exterminated most of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="637.35" dur="5.37">out of Iraq and Libya the haft art is</text>
  <text start="641.16" dur="4.26">making huge gains there</text>
  <text start="642.72" dur="4.71">Lebanon is going after the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="645.42" dur="5.88">the Islamic state is really not a threat</text>
  <text start="647.43" dur="6.32">anymore and the United States back</text>
  <text start="651.3" dur="5.43">during Obama&amp;#39;s term said even when we</text>
  <text start="653.75" dur="4.48">beat the Islamic state in Syria which we</text>
  <text start="656.73" dur="2.94">knew they were never going to do the</text>
  <text start="658.23" dur="3.09">United States was never going to leave</text>
  <text start="659.67" dur="4.919">Syria owner or Iraq</text>
  <text start="661.32" dur="6.06">now the US State Department spokesman</text>
  <text start="664.589" dur="5.821">Heather normal art said the following</text>
  <text start="667.38" dur="5.7">that the United States has no intention</text>
  <text start="670.41" dur="5.13">of staying in Syria after defeating the</text>
  <text start="673.08" dur="4.199">Islamic state terrorists where the</text>
  <text start="675.54" dur="4.62">United States is going to be leaving</text>
  <text start="677.279" dur="5.881">Syria not staying and it&amp;#39;s amazing how</text>
  <text start="680.16" dur="5.61">Russia stepped in work with Syria</text>
  <text start="683.16" dur="5.82">work with Iran work with Turkey and</text>
  <text start="685.77" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;re able to destroy the Islamic</text>
  <text start="688.98" dur="6.9">state because remember during this</text>
  <text start="692.49" dur="5.789">period of time of Obama&amp;#39;s reign the</text>
  <text start="695.88" dur="4.29">corporate media Obama all the generals</text>
  <text start="698.279" dur="3.631">were saying no we can&amp;#39;t beat the Islamic</text>

  <text start="701.91" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re too powerful they have their own</text>
  <text start="704.31" dur="5.79">income and all that was completely</text>
  <text start="706.77" dur="4.23">destroyed and showed that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="710.1" dur="3.66">state and all these terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="711" dur="4.95">were being supported by the United</text>
  <text start="713.76" dur="5.73">States by the coalition forces by Israel</text>
  <text start="715.95" dur="5.82">and this proves once again</text>
  <text start="719.49" dur="5.01">that we weren&amp;#39;t trying to destroy them</text>
  <text start="721.77" dur="5.879">we were helping them take control of</text>
  <text start="724.5" dur="5.82">Syria we are helping them take control</text>
  <text start="727.649" dur="6.75">of Iraq to keep the borders open now</text>
  <text start="730.32" dur="6.24">everything is being shut down now we</text>
  <text start="734.399" dur="4.621">know there&amp;#39;s a huge battle going on</text>
  <text start="736.56" dur="4.62">between the Cabal the Trump</text>
  <text start="739.02" dur="3.509">administration and it&amp;#39;s being fought</text>
  <text start="741.18" dur="3.93">right in front of the American people</text>
  <text start="742.529" dur="4.831">and we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="745.11" dur="4.53">definitely falling apart for the Cabal</text>
  <text start="747.36" dur="5.66">they&amp;#39;re trying everything they possible</text>
  <text start="749.64" dur="6.3">possibly can to keep control of</text>
  <text start="753.02" dur="4.6">basically everything because look what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="755.94" dur="2.91">happening in the Middle East everything</text>
  <text start="757.62" dur="3.48">that they fought for everything that</text>
  <text start="758.85" dur="4.5">they created is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="761.1" dur="5.1">the only thing they have left right now</text>
  <text start="763.35" dur="4.95">is some type of false flag event which</text>
  <text start="766.2" dur="3.12">they could do with North Korea I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="768.3" dur="2.82">think they&amp;#39;re going to do anything with</text>
  <text start="769.32" dur="3">them as well I think Syria is a lost</text>
  <text start="771.12" dur="4.08">cause right now so I think right now</text>
  <text start="772.32" dur="4.59">what they have is North Korea or they</text>
  <text start="775.2" dur="4.17">need to do something here in the United</text>
  <text start="776.91" dur="5.64">States because their main goal is to get</text>
  <text start="779.37" dur="5.94">rid of Trump and you can see with these</text>
  <text start="782.55" dur="6">different government officials where</text>
  <text start="785.31" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re filing you know letters of</text>
  <text start="788.55" dur="3">impeachment they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="790.41" dur="3.299">whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="791.55" dur="5.01">to remove him or to make him look like</text>
  <text start="793.709" dur="6">he&amp;#39;s a racist a white supremacist</text>
  <text start="796.56" dur="5.73">a neo-nazi and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="799.709" dur="4.471">trying to do and we can see that they</text>
  <text start="802.29" dur="4.35">use different groups like an Tifa and</text>
  <text start="804.18" dur="3.33">many others to push their agenda now</text>
  <text start="806.64" dur="3.93">antiva</text>
  <text start="807.51" dur="6.78">they are scheduling protests on November</text>
  <text start="810.57" dur="5.37">4th will they become violent maybe maybe</text>
  <text start="814.29" dur="5.52">not but we can see from what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="815.94" dur="7.769">saying is that they are planning to end</text>
  <text start="819.81" dur="6.21">the Trump ence regime via acts of</text>
  <text start="823.709" dur="4.231">violence and terrorism across the United</text>
  <text start="826.02" dur="4.259">States so this is one of the dates that</text>
  <text start="827.94" dur="3.839">we need to look at and look to see</text>
  <text start="830.279" dur="3.18">what&amp;#39;s going to happen because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="831.779" dur="5.071">already saying that they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="833.459" dur="5.551">something for this period of time now as</text>
  <text start="836.85" dur="3.69">we can see the corporate media is still</text>
  <text start="839.01" dur="3.69">pushing their agenda there the</text>
  <text start="840.54" dur="4.53">mouthpiece of the cabal and we can see</text>
  <text start="842.7" dur="4.139">that Trump is using different types of</text>
  <text start="845.07" dur="3.84">strategy but there&amp;#39;s a huge battle who&amp;#39;s</text>
