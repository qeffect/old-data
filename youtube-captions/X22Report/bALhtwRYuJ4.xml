  <text start="49.61" dur="6.54">news now out in Greece the situation is</text>
  <text start="53.17" dur="5.29">absolutely crazy but we have to</text>
  <text start="56.15" dur="4.619">understand that Greece there is no</text>
  <text start="58.46" dur="5.129">revenue coming in from the people yes</text>
  <text start="60.769" dur="5.251">there is some but not enough to keep the</text>
  <text start="63.589" dur="4.381">government operational we see that</text>
  <text start="66.02" dur="5.43">seventy percent of the Greek mortgages</text>
  <text start="67.97" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re just not being paid the economy</text>
  <text start="71.45" dur="4.669">in Greece is so bad that Greeks have</text>
  <text start="74.39" dur="5.1">stopped paying their personal and</text>
  <text start="76.119" dur="7.721">consumer debts and are raising cash by</text>
  <text start="79.49" dur="8.19">selling fair family heirlooms the people</text>

  <text start="97.31" dur="7.41">European Union now how is this going</text>
  <text start="101.86" dur="6.13">well we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of protests</text>
  <text start="104.72" dur="5.9">right now in London campaigners will</text>
  <text start="107.99" dur="6.45">gather in central London on Tuesday in</text>
  <text start="110.62" dur="7.33">solidarity with the Greek people they</text>
  <text start="114.44" dur="7.23">warned troika austerity dictates have</text>
  <text start="117.95" dur="6.209">been unnecessary economically unsound</text>
  <text start="121.67" dur="5.21">and have left a trail of poverty</text>
  <text start="124.159" dur="5.25">homelessness and suicide in their wake</text>
  <text start="126.88" dur="5.859">again the central bankers don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="129.409" dur="6.601">about that all they care about is we</text>
  <text start="132.739" dur="6.481">need to extend our debt we need to put</text>
  <text start="136.01" dur="5.85">the countries in debt who cares about</text>
  <text start="139.22" dur="4.53">the people as long as we can gobble up</text>
  <text start="141.86" dur="4.34">their natural resources because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.75" dur="8.01">where the where the real wealth is and</text>
  <text start="146.2" dur="7.47">we see in Greece angry pensioners have</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="4.8">hit the streets of the Greek capital</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="7.06">protesting against the reports of new</text>
  <text start="156.56" dur="5.52">austerity in the new plan that tsipras</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="6.2">has</text>
  <text start="162.08" dur="8.01">produced and hand it off to the IMF and</text>
  <text start="166.93" dur="6.49">we see about 70 buses have arrived in</text>
  <text start="170.09" dur="6.11">athens today full of pensioners eager to</text>
  <text start="173.42" dur="5.16">protest against the proposed deal and</text>
  <text start="176.2" dur="5.83">they&amp;#39;re saying that this is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="178.58" dur="6.72">pensions have been cut by between 60 and</text>
  <text start="182.03" dur="5.31">40 percent and now they want more with</text>
  <text start="185.3" dur="6.69">additional income for health care and</text>
  <text start="187.34" dur="8.6">the like and the people are tapped out</text>
  <text start="191.99" dur="7.77">they just have nothing else to give and</text>
  <text start="195.94" dur="7.51">tsipras went ahead and said ok here is</text>
  <text start="199.76" dur="7.02">my bailout agreement we will accept the</text>
  <text start="203.45" dur="8.49">bailout extension and right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="9.75">running into trouble the party the</text>
  <text start="211.94" dur="7.519">tsipras party in parliament is not</text>
  <text start="216.53" dur="6.26">looking favorable favorably on this plan</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="5.651">they don&amp;#39;t really agree with it and</text>
  <text start="222.79" dur="4.24">they&amp;#39;re out there saying I believe that</text>
  <text start="225.11" dur="7.77">this program as we see it is difficult</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="9.989">to pass by we won&amp;#39;t be able to pass this</text>
  <text start="232.88" dur="9.15">in Parliament the Prime Minister has to</text>
  <text start="237.019" dur="7.201">first inform the people on why he feel</text>
  <text start="242.03" dur="5.31">he failed and the government failed in</text>
  <text start="244.22" dur="7.11">the negotiation and ended up with this</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="6.27">type of result and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="251.33" dur="4.379">the people are not going to take too</text>
  <text start="253.61" dur="6.9">kindly to this they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="255.709" dur="7.741">protesting and at this time I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="260.51" dur="6.42">think even if the IMF and the Parliament</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="6">both say okay this is a great deal this</text>
  <text start="266.93" dur="4.41">will not help Greece whatsoever yes in</text>
  <text start="269.45" dur="3.54">this short term we&amp;#39;ve seen this help in</text>
  <text start="271.34" dur="3.42">the short term but is it really helped</text>
  <text start="272.99" dur="3.96">or is it just keeping the government</text>
  <text start="274.76" dur="5.31">operational does it really help the</text>
  <text start="276.95" dur="5.64">people no because there&amp;#39;s austerity</text>
  <text start="280.07" dur="7.08">there&amp;#39;s pension cuts there&amp;#39;s more taxes</text>
  <text start="282.59" dur="9.27">and when we look at the the proposal we</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="7.25">see higher taxes welfare charges we see</text>
  <text start="291.86" dur="7.73">pension cuts</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="6.78">and the people here in Greece are going</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="4.079">to see this and say you know something</text>
  <text start="301.18" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re done and of course they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="303.669" dur="5.101">there telling us that the people want to</text>
  <text start="305.11" dur="5.49">stay in the European Union they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="4.649">protesting but does it really make sense</text>
  <text start="310.6" dur="5.159">the European Union who put the country</text>
  <text start="313.419" dur="5.581">into debt who stole their natural</text>
  <text start="315.759" dur="6.41">resources by buying it but with penny on</text>
  <text start="319" dur="6.9">the dollar people are out of work</text>
  <text start="322.169" dur="5.681">starving can&amp;#39;t pay any other bills but</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="4.71">they want to stay in the European Union</text>
  <text start="327.85" dur="5.58">does this make any sense whatsoever no</text>
  <text start="330.61" dur="4.2">it really doesn&amp;#39;t and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="333.43" dur="3.33">all being fanned up right now to</text>
  <text start="334.81" dur="6.03">convince everyone that yeah the people</text>
  <text start="336.76" dur="5.25">want this now the IMF receive the</text>
  <text start="340.84" dur="3.63">proposal and at first they said they</text>
  <text start="342.01" dur="4.529">disagree with it they disagree with</text>
  <text start="344.47" dur="4.65">grease on the corporate tax the VAT and</text>
  <text start="346.539" dur="3.901">pensions and then they went ahead and</text>
  <text start="349.12" dur="3.93">said you know all right maybe it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="350.44" dur="4.59">that bad but I don&amp;#39;t think it really</text>
  <text start="353.05" dur="6.42">matters at this point because the Greek</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="7.319">poram Parliament is set to reject the</text>
  <text start="359.47" dur="5.94">current proposal they&amp;#39;re not looking to</text>
  <text start="362.349" dur="7.651">pass this because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="365.41" dur="8.249">right now is they want to include luxury</text>
  <text start="370" dur="8.43">taxes they&amp;#39;re going to increase taxes by</text>
  <text start="373.659" dur="8.07">twenty-nine percent this is on corporate</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="6.479">taxes they&amp;#39;re going to cut pensions it</text>
  <text start="381.729" dur="5.731">just seems like nothing has really been</text>
  <text start="384.909" dur="5.371">worked out here it seems like tsipras is</text>
  <text start="387.46" dur="6.239">just trying to appease everyone at this</text>
  <text start="390.28" dur="6.09">point but the funny thing is when all</text>
  <text start="393.699" dur="5.25">this is happening while tsipras is</text>
  <text start="396.37" dur="6.45">handing off this plan he signed the deal</text>
  <text start="398.949" dur="8.131">with Putin on the new gas pipeline so if</text>
  <text start="402.82" dur="6.719">the European Union the IMF and the Greek</text>
  <text start="407.08" dur="5.04">government say okay let&amp;#39;s go with this</text>
  <text start="409.539" dur="5.491">new proposal what do they do with the</text>
  <text start="412.12" dur="4.859">Turkish stream because you know the US</text>
  <text start="415.03" dur="3.9">government central bankers you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="416.979" dur="5.25">to say no no you have to break that deal</text>
  <text start="418.93" dur="5.669">you we cannot have that and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="422.229" dur="5.101">think Greece is going to go ahead and do</text>
  <text start="424.599" dur="3.93">this so at this time I think this new</text>
  <text start="427.33" dur="4.499">proposal was to</text>
  <text start="428.529" dur="6.38">I tsipras sometime I mean we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="431.829" dur="6.39">see how it goes if they do make a deal</text>
  <text start="434.909" dur="5.8">it&amp;#39;s not going to help whatsoever</text>
  <text start="438.219" dur="5.43">because in two three four five months we</text>
  <text start="440.709" dur="5.22">will be in the same exact position just</text>
  <text start="443.649" dur="4.26">like back in two thousand eight when</text>
  <text start="445.929" dur="4.65">they accepted the deal in the IMF the</text>
  <text start="447.909" dur="5.67">ECB all were out there telling us how</text>
  <text start="450.579" dur="5.88">great it was everything is fine then</text>
  <text start="453.579" dur="7.38">they had another tranche of debt and we</text>
  <text start="456.459" dur="8.61">know that debt does not help spurring</text>
  <text start="460.959" dur="6.84">economic growth this is what helps now</text>
  <text start="465.069" dur="6.21">here in the United States Gallup&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.799" dur="10.49">latest economic confidence inga index re</text>
  <text start="471.279" dur="9.96">tumbled to negative 9 so we haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="478.289" dur="6.58">the confidence index this low since</text>
  <text start="481.239" dur="6.92">november of 2014 right before the</text>
  <text start="484.869" dur="6.45">holiday season which was a complete bust</text>
  <text start="488.159" dur="8.74">retail completely collapsed during the</text>
  <text start="491.319" dur="13.2">holiday season and the last time we saw</text>
  <text start="496.899" dur="12.18">that hope was so low the Fed kicked in</text>

  <text start="509.079" dur="8.01">the economy is getting worse not better</text>
  <text start="513.569" dur="6.75">so what does that tell you people are</text>
  <text start="517.089" dur="5.88">actually starting to feel it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="520.319" dur="4.031">understanding it and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="522.969" dur="4.34">what the government the central bankers</text>
  <text start="524.35" dur="5.219">tell us what their ridiculous statistics</text>
  <text start="527.309" dur="6.911">they can tell us unemployment three</text>
  <text start="529.569" dur="7.77">percent if you put out a resume and you</text>
  <text start="534.22" dur="5.429">cannot find the same high paying job or</text>
  <text start="537.339" dur="5.34">if you&amp;#39;re coming out of college and you</text>
  <text start="539.649" dur="4.8">cannot find the paying job that the</text>
  <text start="542.679" dur="3.9">College promise you were going to get by</text>
  <text start="544.449" dur="4.711">spending all that money with student</text>
  <text start="546.579" dur="4.92">loans people are going to say something</text>
  <text start="549.16" dur="6.63">is wrong and this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="551.499" dur="6.751">right now we see may disappoints in</text>
  <text start="555.79" dur="5.85">durable goods it declined by one point</text>
  <text start="558.25" dur="7.2">eight percent they expected only 8.1</text>
  <text start="561.64" dur="7.29">and drop missed five of the seven months</text>
  <text start="565.45" dur="6.6">right now durable goods orders NSA down</text>
  <text start="568.93" dur="6.72">five percent year-on-year the largest 10</text>
  <text start="572.05" dur="5.42">months slump since 2009 of December the</text>
  <text start="575.65" dur="7.95">last time we dropped this much the Fed</text>
  <text start="577.47" dur="11.23">unleashed qe3 so where are we today we</text>
  <text start="583.6" dur="8.58">are nowhere we have not recovered we are</text>
  <text start="588.7" dur="5.1">bouncing along the bottom they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="592.18" dur="3.39">to make it seem like it&amp;#39;s recovery</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="3.69">because any little surge or something</text>
  <text start="595.57" dur="4.67">from the bottom they say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.49" dur="6.66">recovering but when we really look at it</text>
  <text start="600.24" dur="8.59">we are nowhere near the highs of tufa</text>
  <text start="604.15" dur="9.26">two thousand five six seven or prior</text>
  <text start="608.83" dur="9.18">years we are in depression territory</text>
  <text start="613.41" dur="9.52">collapse territory we see us</text>
  <text start="618.01" dur="8.55">manufacturing PMI hovered at its lowest</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="5.49">level since january of 2014 markets US</text>

  <text start="628.42" dur="8.01">to 53.4 against expectations of 54.1</text>
  <text start="632.91" dur="6.34">this is the weakest since October 2013</text>
  <text start="636.43" dur="6.62">and the biggest miss since august of</text>
  <text start="639.25" dur="6.6">2013 we are seeing a loss of momentum</text>
  <text start="643.05" dur="6.52">heading into the third quarter market</text>
  <text start="645.85" dur="6.3">notes which is odd because the corporate</text>
  <text start="649.57" dur="4.74">media the US government the central</text>
  <text start="652.15" dur="5.07">bankers they&amp;#39;re saying that everything</text>
  <text start="654.31" dur="5.7">is awesome this is what a recovery looks</text>
  <text start="657.22" dur="5.7">like and everything is just going to get</text>
  <text start="660.01" dur="6.33">better and better but guess what we are</text>
  <text start="662.92" dur="5.55">not seeing this whatsoever things are</text>
  <text start="666.34" dur="4.77">not getting better they&amp;#39;re bouncing</text>
  <text start="668.47" dur="5.19">along the bottom the central banks are</text>
  <text start="671.11" dur="5.93">blowing up the bubbles larger and larger</text>
  <text start="673.66" dur="7.68">to keep this system going and eventually</text>
  <text start="677.04" dur="6.64">they will pop now the corporate media of</text>

  <text start="694.81" dur="4.52">now too</text>
  <text start="695.55" dur="4.89">have probably revised it once again of</text>

  <text start="1412.95" dur="5.04">to be prepared to now we&amp;#39;re hearing a</text>
  <text start="1415.23" dur="5.79">lot from governments we&amp;#39;re hearing a lot</text>
  <text start="1417.99" dur="5.88">from the FBI department of homeland</text>
  <text start="1421.02" dur="7.14">security that they just don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="1423.87" dur="6.39">encryption because it allows the</text>
  <text start="1428.16" dur="4.35">terrorists to communicate and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1430.26" dur="5.33">spy on them and I&amp;#39;ve said this many</text>
  <text start="1432.51" dur="6.72">times before encryption has been around</text>
  <text start="1435.59" dur="6.55">for thousands of years they just use</text>
  <text start="1439.23" dur="5.48">different techniques I mean hard copy on</text>
  <text start="1442.14" dur="5.28">paper they had different ways of</text>
  <text start="1444.71" dur="7.27">encrypting a letter by using like every</text>
  <text start="1447.42" dur="7.23">third letter to create a sentence they</text>
  <text start="1451.98" dur="5.37">had different methods of encrypting</text>
  <text start="1454.65" dur="4.71">different information and this has</text>
  <text start="1457.35" dur="5.13">nothing to do with computers with social</text>
  <text start="1459.36" dur="6.6">media what they&amp;#39;re saying is they have</text>
  <text start="1462.48" dur="5.16">the ability today to hear listen read</text>
  <text start="1465.96" dur="4.29">what everyone is saying and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1467.64" dur="5.4">easy for them because they can tap into</text>
  <text start="1470.25" dur="5.01">this from one location when it was hard</text>
  <text start="1473.04" dur="4.68">copy on paper it was much much more</text>
  <text start="1475.26" dur="5.67">difficult so today they have the ability</text>
  <text start="1477.72" dur="5.16">just to basically see everything and</text>
  <text start="1480.93" dur="3.75">they want everything wide open so they</text>
  <text start="1482.88" dur="3.96">can see this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="1484.68" dur="3.3">terrorism this has to do with spying on</text>
  <text start="1486.84" dur="3.45">the people but encryption is very</text>
  <text start="1487.98" dur="4.38">important just like keys to your house</text>
  <text start="1490.29" dur="4.83">to lock it up and to keep your valuables</text>
  <text start="1492.36" dur="4.61">safe it&amp;#39;s like the keys to your car so</text>
  <text start="1495.12" dur="4.1">no one steals it you want to lock</text>
  <text start="1496.97" dur="3.63">up it&amp;#39;s like keeping the combination to</text>
  <text start="1499.22" dur="3.66">your safe hidden because you know what</text>
  <text start="1500.6" dur="4.89">anyone going into your safe well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1502.88" dur="5.1">the same thing with your data it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1505.49" dur="5.309">matter if it&amp;#39;s hard copy papers inside</text>
  <text start="1507.98" dur="7.65">your safe or its digital you want to</text>
  <text start="1510.799" dur="8.49">keep it safe and encryption that is your</text>

  <text start="1572.809" dur="5.071">of the systems and now these companies</text>
  <text start="1575" dur="7.74">supposedly allegedly are saying no more</text>

  <text start="1617.9" dur="5.55">from the government because you can use</text>

  <text start="1700.94" dur="5.18">they&amp;#39;ll just say copyright infringement</text>
  <text start="1702.35" dur="8.49">and what do they really have to prove</text>
  <text start="1706.12" dur="10.09">not much and they use this type of</text>
  <text start="1710.84" dur="7.11">technique all over the place we see out</text>
  <text start="1716.21" dur="5.099">in Afghanistan we&amp;#39;re getting reports</text>
  <text start="1717.95" dur="6.329">that the security of Afghanistan is on</text>
  <text start="1721.309" dur="6.271">the brink of collapse now we are going</text>
  <text start="1724.279" dur="6">to see this plate-up we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1727.58" dur="5.93">more troops from the u.s. NATO being</text>

  <text start="1733.51" dur="4.299">this is how they&amp;#39;re going to get the</text>
  <text start="1735.35" dur="6.48">troops back into this country no troops</text>
  <text start="1737.809" dur="6.48">will be leaving that area us right now</text>
  <text start="1741.83" dur="4.709">is pre positioning heavy weapons along</text>
  <text start="1744.289" dur="4.801">NATO&amp;#39;s eastern flank this is coming from</text>
  <text start="1746.539" dur="4.081">Ashton Carter they are also pre</text>
  <text start="1749.09" dur="3.27">positioning heavy weapons including</text>
  <text start="1750.62" dur="4.679">tanks infantry fighting vehicles</text>
  <text start="1752.36" dur="6.33">artillery in Central and Eastern Europe</text>

  <text start="1762.559" dur="5.221">equipment in countries in</text>
  <text start="1764.48" dur="7.41">Central and Eastern Europe getting ready</text>
  <text start="1767.78" dur="9.75">for what war this is what their pre</text>
  <text start="1771.89" dur="8.49">positioning for and we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1777.53" dur="6.66">going to be making their move into Saudi</text>
  <text start="1780.38" dur="4.919">into Syria we know that everything is</text>
  <text start="1784.19" dur="3.479">being prepped everything being</text>
  <text start="1785.299" dur="6.031">pre-positioned because they know once</text>
  <text start="1787.669" dur="5.581">this event occurs they need everything</text>
  <text start="1791.33" dur="5.099">ready because it will turn out to be a</text>
  <text start="1793.25" dur="6.87">full-fledged war and most likely in the</text>
  <text start="1796.429" dur="5.701">end it probably will go nuclear and we</text>
  <text start="1800.12" dur="5.07">see Saudi Arabia like I mentioned in a</text>
  <text start="1802.13" dur="6.6">previous report they are making deals</text>
  <text start="1805.19" dur="8.1">with Putin trying to bribe him trying to</text>
  <text start="1808.73" dur="9.319">see where he stands and we see the Saudi</text>
  <text start="1813.29" dur="9.03">King is meeting with Russia with Putin</text>
  <text start="1818.049" dur="9.041">discussing how they can join forces with</text>
  <text start="1822.32" dur="9.87">oil to be to create a petroleum alliance</text>
  <text start="1827.09" dur="6.36">and we know this is all for many</text>
  <text start="1832.19" dur="4.89">different reasons but one of the main</text>
  <text start="1833.45" dur="8.37">ones is to get Putin to step aside from</text>
  <text start="1837.08" dur="7.2">Assad well Putin came out and he said</text>
  <text start="1841.82" dur="4.71">that Moscow is ready to work with Syrian</text>
  <text start="1844.28" dur="4.62">President Assad to pave the way for</text>
  <text start="1846.53" dur="5.25">political reform in Syria poon</text>
  <text start="1848.9" dur="4.89">underscored that Moscow&amp;#39;s support for</text>
  <text start="1851.78" dur="4.2">Assad is driven by fears that</text>
  <text start="1853.79" dur="4.62">overthrowing him by force may lead</text>
  <text start="1855.98" dur="5.52">war-torn Syria to slide into further</text>
  <text start="1858.41" dur="5.91">chaos like Libya Yemen Lebanon and he</text>
  <text start="1861.5" dur="6.21">knows this is what will happen and Putin</text>
  <text start="1864.32" dur="6.96">criticized the u.s. saying they cannot</text>
  <text start="1867.71" dur="13.349">dictate ultimatums to Russia to back off</text>
  <text start="1871.28" dur="11.82">Assad he says that any attempt of a coup</text>
  <text start="1881.059" dur="3.691">that could lead the country to descend</text>
  <text start="1883.1" dur="5.52">into the situation that Libya or Iraq</text>
  <text start="1884.75" dur="5.97">has reached is unacceptable he noted</text>
  <text start="1888.62" dur="4.95">that Moscow does not want developments</text>
  <text start="1890.72" dur="5.28">in Syria to reach such a situation this</text>
  <text start="1893.57" dur="3.88">is why he will stay with Assad and</text>
  <text start="1896" dur="7.51">support Assad</text>
  <text start="1897.45" dur="9.9">and again Saudi Arabia tried this once</text>
  <text start="1903.51" dur="6">before and I think they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="1907.35" dur="4.86">for two reasons one to see where Putin</text>
  <text start="1909.51" dur="4.259">stands to see if he would step aside to</text>
  <text start="1912.21" dur="4.079">make it easier to go into Syria because</text>
  <text start="1913.769" dur="4.951">they know if the coalition forces move</text>
  <text start="1916.289" dur="5.88">into Syria Russia is waiting on the</text>
  <text start="1918.72" dur="5.61">other side Russia is not going to sit</text>
  <text start="1922.169" dur="4.86">back Iran is not going to sit back and</text>
  <text start="1924.33" dur="5.39">they all know this and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1927.029" dur="5.25">figure out a way to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="1929.72" dur="4.809">they need to go in there now they tried</text>
  <text start="1932.279" dur="8.03">the chlorine gas they tried the sarin</text>
  <text start="1934.529" dur="5.78">gas back in 2013 they tried the terror a</text>
  <text start="1940.7" dur="4.9">propaganda that he&amp;#39;s a terrorist he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1942.899" dur="3.99">torturing people he&amp;#39;s bombing his own</text>
  <text start="1945.6" dur="4.5">people they tried everything possible</text>
  <text start="1946.889" dur="7.711">and if they go in right now and they try</text>
  <text start="1950.1" dur="7.59">to remove Assad everyone the world is</text>
  <text start="1954.6" dur="4.319">going to see this as okay we understand</text>
  <text start="1957.69" dur="3.57">now that the Islamic state was your</text>
  <text start="1958.919" dur="7.98">proxy army and this whole thing was just</text>
  <text start="1961.26" dur="8.73">to get Assad and war will start and this</text>
  <text start="1966.899" dur="7.051">is why they&amp;#39;re taking their time trying</text>
  <text start="1969.99" dur="5.669">to figure it out and this is why at this</text>
  <text start="1973.95" dur="4.53">point in time there is no authorization</text>
  <text start="1975.659" dur="4.65">for war and we can see that they are</text>
  <text start="1978.48" dur="4.62">definitely pushing some type of an event</text>
  <text start="1980.309" dur="7.59">to get the ball rolling and we see that</text>
  <text start="1983.1" dur="8.809">it is building up into August we see</text>
  <text start="1987.899" dur="8.49">that a lot of propaganda is out there a</text>
  <text start="1991.909" dur="9.01">lot of countries are trying to maneuver</text>
  <text start="1996.389" dur="7.861">get military assets set Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="2000.919" dur="9.24">trying to maneuver Putin away from Assad</text>
  <text start="2004.25" dur="7.679">and we see that Congress is not budging</text>
  <text start="2010.159" dur="3.211">on the authorization for war but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2011.929" dur="4.98">a couple lawmakers in there trying to</text>
  <text start="2013.37" dur="6.809">push it and they are going to be stuck</text>
  <text start="2016.909" dur="5.191">and they will turn to an event because</text>
  <text start="2020.179" dur="6.441">this is the only way they know how to</text>
  <text start="2022.1" dur="7.41">get the people moved enough to go in and</text>
  <text start="2026.62" dur="4.72">support a war and they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="2029.51" dur="3.21">most likely it&amp;#39;s the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="2031.34" dur="3.42">then they&amp;#39;ll tell us that it&amp;#39;s Russia</text>
  <text start="2032.72" dur="4.95">attacking the financial institutions and</text>
  <text start="2034.76" dur="5.52">so on and so forth we see the house</text>
