  <text start="98.27" dur="10.309">took the bait the entire trap has been</text>
  <text start="101.719" dur="9.091">set and Powell today confirmed exactly</text>
  <text start="108.579" dur="7.201">what we&amp;#39;ve been told</text>
  <text start="110.81" dur="9.03">gold will destroy the Fed Powell even</text>
  <text start="115.78" dur="6.1">explained how this is all going to</text>
  <text start="119.84" dur="2.959">happen we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about that</text>
  <text start="121.88" dur="5.97">in just a minute</text>
  <text start="122.799" dur="7.421">but we knew from the very beginning that</text>
  <text start="127.85" dur="10.26">Trump and the Patriots they had full</text>
  <text start="130.22" dur="11.76">control over the Fed Powell was giving</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="6.39">testimony in front of Congress and he</text>
  <text start="141.98" dur="4.83">said no matter what we are looking at</text>
  <text start="144.5" dur="6.57">right now doesn&amp;#39;t matter that the jobs</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="8.19">report looks good we are still going to</text>
  <text start="151.07" dur="7.35">cut rates most likely in July maybe</text>
  <text start="155" dur="5.909">August and many economists were out</text>
  <text start="158.42" dur="5.45">there saying they didn&amp;#39;t think he was</text>
  <text start="160.909" dur="6.681">actually going to do it</text>
  <text start="163.87" dur="7.05">and he is going to do it why because the</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="7.319">Patriots are in control this is not a</text>
  <text start="170.92" dur="10.08">game this is about removing the central</text>
  <text start="174.909" dur="9.841">bank and we know that Trump has two</text>
  <text start="181" dur="5.579">individuals that he nominated that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.75" dur="3.9">going to take these two individuals and</text>
  <text start="186.579" dur="6.091">put them into the Fed now the original</text>
  <text start="188.65" dur="5.419">two individuals I believe he did this on</text>
  <text start="192.67" dur="5.129">purpose</text>
  <text start="194.069" dur="8.14">he knew that they weren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="197.799" dur="5.701">accept Kane and more he knew that this</text>
  <text start="202.209" dur="4.681">was going to be a big problem and I</text>
  <text start="203.5" dur="5.569">believe this was his strategy yes I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="206.89" dur="4.98">going to give you these two people</text>
  <text start="209.069" dur="4.98">you&amp;#39;re gonna hate them and then I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="211.87" dur="5">gonna give you the people I really want</text>
  <text start="214.049" dur="6.97">because right now the Republicans</text>
  <text start="216.87" dur="10.81">they&amp;#39;re not that hostile over his picks</text>
  <text start="221.019" dur="9.78">and they believe that Judy Shelton she</text>
  <text start="227.68" dur="7.08">will be nominated she&amp;#39;ll be accepted and</text>
  <text start="230.799" dur="5.581">she&amp;#39;ll be on the board and we know the</text>
  <text start="234.76" dur="5.759">mainstream media we know the deep state</text>
  <text start="236.38" dur="6.57">they do not want this to happen now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.519" dur="8.041">very interesting is that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="242.95" dur="8.219">media they completely took the bait what</text>
  <text start="248.56" dur="4.019">do I mean by this well if you look at</text>
  <text start="251.169" dur="4.44">the article from CNN</text>
  <text start="252.579" dur="3.87">it says Fed chair looks for backup from</text>
  <text start="255.609" dur="5.16">Congress</text>
  <text start="256.449" dur="7.081">amid Trump&amp;#39;s onslaught what is Trump had</text>
  <text start="260.769" dur="5.221">been doing what he&amp;#39;s been calling out</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="6.6">the Fed pointing the finger at Powell</text>
  <text start="265.99" dur="8.07">saying I&amp;#39;m going to fire him I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="6.69">like what he&amp;#39;s doing the Fed has no clue</text>
  <text start="274.06" dur="3.9">in what they&amp;#39;re doing now remember this</text>
  <text start="276.82" dur="5.25">was a complete setup</text>
  <text start="277.96" dur="6.72">remember sessions now a lot of people</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="4.59">thought oh sessions he&amp;#39;s a screw-up oh</text>
  <text start="284.68" dur="4.83">sessions not doing what he needs to be</text>
  <text start="286.66" dur="5.43">doing sessions did exactly what he</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="5.459">needed to do Trump played it up and</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="5.56">everybody wanted sessions because later</text>
  <text start="294.969" dur="5.081">on they&amp;#39;re all going to find out what</text>
  <text start="297.65" dur="5.37">sessions actually did started the</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="6.72">investigation with Epstein cleaned out</text>
  <text start="303.02" dur="5.55">the Department of Justice and when they</text>
  <text start="306.77" dur="4.98">start to realize what sessions was all</text>
  <text start="308.57" dur="6.36">about well it&amp;#39;s not gonna sit nicely</text>
  <text start="311.75" dur="4.729">with them but think about sessions and</text>
  <text start="314.93" dur="4.609">think about Powell</text>
  <text start="316.479" dur="7.931">the mainstream media right now is</text>
  <text start="319.539" dur="6.88">backing him up saying listen Trump is</text>
  <text start="324.41" dur="4.95">not gonna fire you we got you</text>
  <text start="326.419" dur="5">Powell knows what he&amp;#39;s doing don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="329.36" dur="4.65">about it or does he</text>
  <text start="331.419" dur="5.381">this is exactly what Trump and the</text>
  <text start="334.01" dur="6.18">Patriots won they want the mainstream</text>
  <text start="336.8" dur="8.25">media the deep state they want them to</text>
  <text start="340.19" dur="7.17">back Powell and we see already with</text>
  <text start="345.05" dur="6.57">Larry Kudlow he&amp;#39;s out there and said</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="6.869">well Powell&amp;#39;s job is safe at the present</text>
  <text start="351.62" dur="5.34">time and they were all worried that</text>
  <text start="354.229" dur="4.41">Trump is gonna fire him why would he</text>
  <text start="356.96" dur="6.45">fire him at this point he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="358.639" dur="7.65">exactly what Trump wants now in another</text>
  <text start="363.41" dur="5.819">article and this is coming out of CNN it</text>
  <text start="366.289" dur="6.75">says inside the feds Hall of Mirrors</text>
  <text start="369.229" dur="5.851">problem and it reads as follows the</text>
  <text start="373.039" dur="4.611">Federal Reserve has allowed itself to</text>
  <text start="375.08" dur="6.869">get backed into a corner by Wall Street</text>
  <text start="377.65" dur="7.96">that means the central bank may may need</text>
  <text start="381.949" dur="7.741">to slash interest rates even if it</text>
  <text start="385.61" dur="5.1">doesn&amp;#39;t want to markets believe a rate</text>
  <text start="389.69" dur="2.789">cut later this month</text>
  <text start="390.71" dur="3.42">is a slam dunk and the Fed has done</text>
  <text start="392.479" dur="4.741">little to push back against that</text>
  <text start="394.13" dur="5.43">thinking keeping rates steady would</text>
  <text start="397.22" dur="4.86">create a market shock one that could</text>
  <text start="399.56" dur="6.06">infect the real economy by denting</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="5.76">confidence economists generally agree</text>
  <text start="405.62" dur="4.35">that the US economy is decelerating from</text>
  <text start="407.84" dur="4.799">a period of strong growth but there is a</text>
  <text start="409.97" dur="5.16">broad disagreement over just how severe</text>
  <text start="412.639" dur="6.451">the slowdown is and whether it merits a</text>
  <text start="415.13" dur="6.12">rate cut from the Fed and they went on</text>
  <text start="419.09" dur="3.96">to say that because of what is happening</text>
  <text start="421.25" dur="4.38">because of the job reports the Fed</text>
  <text start="423.05" dur="8.28">shouldn&amp;#39;t be cutting rates it should be</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="8.029">raising rates hmm remember the</text>
  <text start="431.33" dur="5.79">we Trump put out there that the Fed</text>
  <text start="433.659" dur="7.63">doesn&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="437.12" dur="7.68">mainstream media is now questioning what</text>
  <text start="441.289" dur="7.231">the Fed is doing think about that for a</text>
  <text start="444.8" dur="6.69">second when the system comes tumbling</text>
  <text start="448.52" dur="5.25">down the Fed will be blamed think about</text>
  <text start="451.49" dur="3.979">when the Fed goes ahead and they cut</text>
  <text start="453.77" dur="3.72">rates they start to stimulus</text>
  <text start="455.469" dur="4.771">now the mainstream media is saying</text>
  <text start="457.49" dur="6.209">listen there&amp;#39;s no reason to do this</text>
  <text start="460.24" dur="5.019">because during this period of time when</text>
  <text start="463.699" dur="4.051">we have a jobs report that&amp;#39;s so great</text>
  <text start="465.259" dur="5.791">the Fed should be actually raising rates</text>
  <text start="467.75" dur="6.389">and a rate cut that&amp;#39;s not really going</text>
  <text start="471.05" dur="5.82">to benefit the economy now when the</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="5.31">entire system takes off because of the</text>
  <text start="476.87" dur="5.549">rate cut and stimulus the mainstream</text>
  <text start="479.449" dur="5.911">media well they&amp;#39;re going to be backed</text>
  <text start="482.419" dur="6.271">into a corner because they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="485.36" dur="6.75">that the Fed should be raising rates but</text>
  <text start="488.69" dur="8.42">the Fed did what Trump wanted after</text>
  <text start="492.11" dur="8.82">Trump is elected in 2020 and Trump</text>
  <text start="497.11" dur="7.059">allows the Fed to raise rates like the</text>
  <text start="500.93" dur="8.4">mainstream media wanted this is when the</text>
  <text start="504.169" dur="8.521">economy will fail this is when the</text>
  <text start="509.33" dur="5.639">mainstream media where they said hey</text>
  <text start="512.69" dur="4.589">they should be raising rates because</text>
  <text start="514.969" dur="4.141">that will make the economy better this</text>
  <text start="517.279" dur="3.69">is where the Fed is gonna go off track</text>
  <text start="519.11" dur="4.08">with Trump where they&amp;#39;re saying listen</text>
  <text start="520.969" dur="4.471">you know something we don&amp;#39;t believe the</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="3.78">rate cuts should stay we believe we</text>
  <text start="525.44" dur="3.66">should start raising rates now because</text>
  <text start="526.97" dur="4.59">the economy&amp;#39;s strong enough Trump is</text>
  <text start="529.1" dur="4.53">gonna say listen no the rates have to be</text>
  <text start="531.56" dur="4.26">even lower than where we are today and</text>
  <text start="533.63" dur="4.35">we need more stimulus the Fed is going</text>
  <text start="535.82" dur="6.54">to do the opposite of what Trump is</text>
  <text start="537.98" dur="8.46">saying Trump has already controlled the</text>
  <text start="542.36" dur="7.08">complete narrative of the Fed and the</text>
  <text start="546.44" dur="5.61">Fed will be blamed the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="549.44" dur="5.25">will be blamed because they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="552.05" dur="5.729">who said we should raise rates and</text>
  <text start="554.69" dur="6.54">believe me Trump is going to bring this</text>
  <text start="557.779" dur="6.42">up now let&amp;#39;s go back to when Powell was</text>
  <text start="561.23" dur="3.99">in front of Congress today and he was</text>
  <text start="564.199" dur="3.661">talking about</text>
  <text start="565.22" dur="9.929">the rate cuts he was talking about gold</text>
  <text start="567.86" dur="10.169">yes he did mention gold and Powell told</text>
  <text start="575.149" dur="5.011">Congress that he doesn&amp;#39;t think a return</text>
  <text start="578.029" dur="6.87">to the gold standard in the US would be</text>
  <text start="580.16" dur="7.739">a good idea he said you&amp;#39;ve assigned us</text>
  <text start="584.899" dur="5.63">the job of two direct real economy</text>
  <text start="587.899" dur="6">objectives maximum employment stable</text>
  <text start="590.529" dur="5.68">prices which means no inflation if you</text>
  <text start="593.899" dur="5.821">assigned us to stabilize the dollar</text>
  <text start="596.209" dur="5.31">price of gold monetary policy could do</text>
  <text start="599.72" dur="4.679">that but the other things would</text>
  <text start="601.519" dur="5.13">fluctuate and we wouldn&amp;#39;t care Powell</text>
  <text start="604.399" dur="5.161">said that we wouldn&amp;#39;t care if</text>
  <text start="606.649" dur="6.081">unemployment went down or up that</text>
  <text start="609.56" dur="5.94">wouldn&amp;#39;t be our job anymore</text>
  <text start="612.73" dur="8.589">what they&amp;#39;re doing here is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="615.5" dur="8.22">paving the way to introduce gold now</text>
  <text start="621.319" dur="5.401">remember what the Fed is saying what</text>
  <text start="623.72" dur="5.099">Powell is saying he doesn&amp;#39;t think a</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="7.08">return to the gold standard in the US</text>
  <text start="628.819" dur="7.051">would be a good idea now you might be</text>
  <text start="633.8" dur="5.779">saying well of course the central bank</text>
  <text start="635.87" dur="9">doesn&amp;#39;t like gold but this was done on</text>
  <text start="639.579" dur="9.731">purpose because once the Fed is blamed</text>
  <text start="644.87" dur="7.17">for bringing down the system everyone is</text>
  <text start="649.31" dur="5.879">going to say hey well if they messed up</text>
  <text start="652.04" dur="5.19">the economy and they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="655.189" dur="6.031">gold wouldn&amp;#39;t be good then gold must be</text>
  <text start="657.23" dur="6.81">good for the economy because Powell said</text>
  <text start="661.22" dur="5.609">if you assigned us to stabilize the</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="6.69">dollar price of gold monetary policy</text>
  <text start="666.829" dur="6.961">could do that but the other things would</text>
  <text start="670.73" dur="4.89">fluctuate and we wouldn&amp;#39;t care he said</text>
  <text start="673.79" dur="3.75">we wouldn&amp;#39;t care if unemployment went</text>
  <text start="675.62" dur="2.31">down or up that wouldn&amp;#39;t be our problem</text>
  <text start="677.54" dur="3.09">anymore</text>
  <text start="677.93" dur="6">that wouldn&amp;#39;t be their job and remember</text>
  <text start="680.63" dur="7.1">the Fed they haven&amp;#39;t been doing their</text>
  <text start="683.93" dur="7.5">job if their mandate is to keep</text>
  <text start="687.73" dur="6.219">inflation at zero which means the dollar</text>
  <text start="691.43" dur="4.5">doesn&amp;#39;t lose value have they been doing</text>
  <text start="693.949" dur="3.101">their job have they been following the</text>
  <text start="695.93" dur="5.589">mandate</text>
  <text start="697.05" dur="9.36">no this question was asked on purpose</text>
  <text start="701.519" dur="8.581">and it was to get gold out into the</text>
  <text start="706.41" dur="6.42">public&amp;#39;s mind when the Fed fails and</text>
  <text start="710.1" dur="6.81">Trump turns around and blames the Fed</text>
  <text start="712.83" dur="6.72">for destroying the economy everything</text>
  <text start="716.91" dur="6.96">that the Fed has said everything that</text>
  <text start="719.55" dur="7.229">the Fed has been saying to the people it</text>
  <text start="723.87" dur="6.17">will all turn out to be fake phony and</text>
  <text start="726.779" dur="6.781">false because once the system fails</text>
  <text start="730.04" dur="6.19">they&amp;#39;ll be an audit the audit will show</text>
  <text start="733.56" dur="6.18">that the Fed did not stick to the</text>
  <text start="736.23" dur="5.28">mandate it will show the Fed purposely</text>
  <text start="739.74" dur="5.219">because of the way their system is</text>
  <text start="741.51" dur="7.65">designed it allow the dollar to devalue</text>
  <text start="744.959" dur="7.351">and everything the Fed is telling us now</text>
  <text start="749.16" dur="6.869">about gold would be damaging to the</text>
  <text start="752.31" dur="6.63">economy we shouldn&amp;#39;t use gold everything</text>
  <text start="756.029" dur="5.43">will be then reversed because everyone</text>
