  <text start="114.56" dur="7.439">bit but as we know the entire plan is to</text>
  <text start="119.539" dur="4.29">take this central bank system which is</text>
  <text start="121.999" dur="5.01">an illusion which is completely</text>
  <text start="123.829" dur="7.591">manipulated and make it look the best</text>
  <text start="127.009" dur="6.751">it&amp;#39;s ever been and that is exactly what</text>
  <text start="131.42" dur="6.3">Trump is doing and when we look at</text>
  <text start="133.76" dur="8.22">jobless claims they plunged by 15,000 to</text>
  <text start="137.72" dur="6.93">two hundred and thirteen thousand now we</text>
  <text start="141.98" dur="3.93">understand that all of this has</text>
  <text start="144.65" dur="4.26">manipulated that there&amp;#39;s bubbles</text>
  <text start="145.91" dur="6.15">everywhere that the Federal Reserve the</text>
  <text start="148.91" dur="6.12">central bank system controls how</text>
  <text start="152.06" dur="4.86">everything operates and Trump</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="6.03">understands this the Patriots understand</text>
  <text start="156.92" dur="6.19">how this all operates we see the DEA</text>
  <text start="161.06" dur="4.15">they revise their the</text>
  <text start="163.11" dur="4.5">quarter GDP GDP it was revised</text>
  <text start="165.21" dur="4.56">unexpectedly higher from one point nine</text>
  <text start="167.61" dur="3.75">percent to two point one percent the</text>
  <text start="169.77" dur="5.07">precise number is two point one three</text>
  <text start="171.36" dur="7.53">zero percent and this is up from two</text>
  <text start="174.84" dur="5.97">percent now of course what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="178.89" dur="5.55">here is the same thing we&amp;#39;ve always seen</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="7.47">and Trump the Patriots they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="184.44" dur="6.39">using this to benefit what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="5.82">trying to do and it&amp;#39;s not just about</text>
  <text start="190.83" dur="5.82">getting reelected it&amp;#39;s about keeping</text>
  <text start="194.1" dur="6.17">everything going until they have</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="6.75">everything in place to transition</text>
  <text start="200.27" dur="4.27">everyone out of this economy because</text>
  <text start="203.4" dur="4.16">they&amp;#39;re going to destroy the other</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="6.54">economy it&amp;#39;s gonna fall by the wayside</text>
  <text start="207.56" dur="7.27">the central bank the global system will</text>
  <text start="211.08" dur="4.409">no longer exist and we know that there</text>
  <text start="214.83" dur="4.23">are bad guys</text>
  <text start="215.489" dur="5.161">within the Fed that are that are trying</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="5.28">to stop them that have tried to stop</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="7.02">them and they&amp;#39;re still there now if we</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="5.34">go back a little bit in time here when</text>
  <text start="227.67" dur="4.289">Trump was elected and this is coming out</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="6.18">of the Gateway punning they broke it</text>
  <text start="231.959" dur="8.161">down and you can see exactly how the Fed</text>
  <text start="235.86" dur="6.87">those bad guys within the Fed how they</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="6.72">were trying to stop Trump and the</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="6.569">Patriots from allowing the economy to</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="3.959">grow they wanted it to crash they wanted</text>
  <text start="249.299" dur="3.601">to they wanted the whole thing to</text>
  <text start="250.799" dur="5.37">implode so they could blame it on Trump</text>
  <text start="252.9" dur="5.42">now when you look back in time and you</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="7.5">look back when Trump came into office</text>
  <text start="258.32" dur="10.81">you can see the Fed rate and you can see</text>
  <text start="263.669" dur="7.681">the Dow now as the Fed continually</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="5.31">raised rates now remember in the</text>
  <text start="271.35" dur="4.89">beginning you don&amp;#39;t see it in the</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="4.26">beginning when you&amp;#39;re raising the rates</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="7.62">you don&amp;#39;t see the effect until it hits a</text>
  <text start="278.7" dur="7.23">certain tipping point and when you look</text>
  <text start="283.86" dur="3.69">at this you can see the Fed was raising</text>
  <text start="285.93" dur="4.739">the rate the Fed was raising the rate</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="5.52">the Fed was raising the rate and then we</text>
  <text start="290.669" dur="5.281">never got to that so when you look at</text>
  <text start="293.07" dur="3.75">this you can see the Fed rate is moving</text>
  <text start="295.95" dur="4.2">up and the more</text>
  <text start="296.82" dur="7.44">it is still moving up from 2016 going</text>
  <text start="300.15" dur="7.23">into 2017 going into 2018 it it started</text>
  <text start="304.26" dur="5.76">to slow a little bit in 2017 going into</text>
  <text start="307.38" dur="4.83">2018 because the Fed continually raised</text>
  <text start="310.02" dur="4.02">rates raise rates and then all of a</text>
  <text start="312.21" dur="3.78">sudden trumpet the Patriots said enough</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="4.44">is enough we call it on to what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.99" dur="4.68">trying to do here now we understand we</text>
  <text start="318.48" dur="5.37">have the magic one and we&amp;#39;re gonna put a</text>
  <text start="320.67" dur="5.73">freeze on the rates now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="323.85" dur="7.4">interesting is that Trump in the</text>
  <text start="326.4" dur="9.15">Patriots they froze the rates in 2019 in</text>
  <text start="331.25" dur="7.84">2018 in November around that time period</text>
  <text start="335.55" dur="7.47">the market started to come down and it</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="7.38">fell during the holiday season and then</text>
  <text start="343.02" dur="5.58">it was pumped back up but as you can see</text>
  <text start="346.47" dur="7.71">the market was much much lower at this</text>
  <text start="348.6" dur="9.09">point in 2019 Trump the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="6.42">froze the rates and the market kind of</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="4.77">leveled off didn&amp;#39;t really move then</text>
  <text start="360.6" dur="4.32">Trump said okay now we&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="5.52">dropping the rates and we had one break</text>
  <text start="364.92" dur="6.2">up to rate cut three rate cut and you</text>
  <text start="367.98" dur="6.15">can see the markets start to move up and</text>
  <text start="371.12" dur="6.34">now you can see it clearly when you look</text>
  <text start="374.13" dur="5.37">back in time so the bad guys what they</text>
  <text start="377.46" dur="4.74">were trying to do is they were trying to</text>
  <text start="379.5" dur="4.17">bring down the system now once again we</text>
  <text start="382.2" dur="3.87">see the mainstream media out there we</text>
  <text start="383.67" dur="4.26">see the bad individuals within the</text>
  <text start="386.07" dur="3.32">Federal Reserve where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s going to be no more rate cuts</text>
  <text start="389.39" dur="4.9">they&amp;#39;re trying to do the same thing</text>
  <text start="391.74" dur="5.46">again but we need to understand is that</text>
  <text start="394.29" dur="5.75">Trump of the Patriots they control the</text>
  <text start="397.2" dur="5.7">system they control the magic wand</text>
  <text start="400.04" dur="6.31">they&amp;#39;re calling the shots this is why</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="5.63">Trump had Powell visit him in the White</text>
  <text start="406.35" dur="5.61">House and I do believe that Powell</text>
  <text start="408.53" dur="5.86">somehow someway is working with Trump I</text>
  <text start="411.96" dur="4.35">believe he&amp;#39;s a good guy we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="414.39" dur="4.23">see how that all plays out but for some</text>
  <text start="416.31" dur="5.25">reason my gut is telling me that he is a</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="5.61">good guy and he&amp;#39;s working with Trump</text>
  <text start="421.56" dur="5.31">against those in the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="424.23" dur="4.07">this is why Powell comes out and all of</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="3.609">a sudden he says you know something</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="4.25">we&amp;#39;re gonna freeze</text>
  <text start="430.479" dur="3.361">we&amp;#39;re gonna lower rates even though the</text>
  <text start="432.55" dur="3.78">mainstream media and all the other Fed</text>
  <text start="433.84" dur="3.99">heads were out there saying that oh the</text>
  <text start="436.33" dur="4.83">economy strong there&amp;#39;s no reason to do</text>
  <text start="437.83" dur="7.2">this but Powell seems to go against</text>
  <text start="441.16" dur="7.65">those other individuals now we know that</text>
  <text start="445.03" dur="7.169">Europe is a complete mess and the</text>
  <text start="448.81" dur="5.94">central banks they are now purchasing</text>
  <text start="452.199" dur="5.521">gold in Germany Netherlands Austria</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="4.979">Hungary Turkey and the rest their</text>
  <text start="457.72" dur="3.99">repatriating their goal from the Bank of</text>
  <text start="459.729" dur="4.081">England their repatriating their gold</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="4.92">from the Federal Reserve Bank of New</text>
  <text start="463.81" dur="5.76">York and the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="466.63" dur="5.94">this is because they understand that the</text>
  <text start="469.57" dur="4.95">Fiat system is dying now remember when</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="7.02">you told us that gold is going to</text>
  <text start="474.52" dur="9.6">destroy the Fed if all these central</text>
  <text start="479.59" dur="6.69">banks are purchasing gold and they</text>
  <text start="484.12" dur="6.54">continually purchase gold because they</text>
  <text start="486.28" dur="9.569">know the Fiat system is dying gold then</text>
  <text start="490.66" dur="6.479">will look like the best asset to own so</text>
  <text start="495.849" dur="3.481">if all the countries and all their</text>
  <text start="497.139" dur="5.881">central banks they&amp;#39;re purchasing gold</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="5.16">and these countries have gold and if</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="5.19">most of the countries around the world</text>
  <text start="504.49" dur="6.09">have gold and the Fiat system dies what</text>
  <text start="508.21" dur="4.8">destroys the private western central</text>
  <text start="510.58" dur="4.98">banking system it is gold</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="5.94">now if Trump and the Patriots and other</text>
  <text start="515.56" dur="6.3">Patriots point out that the Fiat system</text>
  <text start="518.95" dur="6.95">is not a system that benefits the people</text>
  <text start="521.86" dur="8.58">that sound money is the system already</text>
  <text start="525.9" dur="10.6">we have all these countries that already</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="8.67">have the gold so gold then destroys the</text>
  <text start="536.5" dur="5.97">central bank system gold then destroys</text>
  <text start="539.11" dur="5.94">the Fed and we can see that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="542.47" dur="5.1">heading down this road now very</text>
  <text start="545.05" dur="6.81">interestingly in the beginning we talked</text>
  <text start="547.57" dur="7.56">about how Trump is using China and this</text>
  <text start="551.86" dur="7.89">trade deal not just to track the central</text>
  <text start="555.13" dur="7.98">bank but to shake the central bank the</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="8.37">globalist system to its core</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="7.62">and destroy it in the end now something</text>
  <text start="568.12" dur="5.64">is shaping up in the political</text>
  <text start="570.73" dur="4.56">background around the u.s. mca and it</text>
  <text start="573.76" dur="3.54">revolves around this which is very</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="4.95">interesting this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="577.3" dur="5.67">conservative tree house the Mexican</text>
  <text start="580.24" dur="6.81">Mexican president and will just use his</text>
  <text start="582.97" dur="6.9">initials and lo a mlo sent a second</text>
  <text start="587.05" dur="6.779">letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="589.87" dur="7.98">urging the u.s. MCA ratification now</text>

  <text start="597.85" dur="8.28">they&amp;#39;re working together against Pelosi</text>
  <text start="600.31" dur="8.399">and others AMLO has been saying the</text>
  <text start="606.13" dur="5.94">labor provisions within the USMC a trade</text>
  <text start="608.709" dur="6.57">pact are already being put in place by</text>
  <text start="612.07" dur="6.269">Mexico and Pelosi should quit trying to</text>
  <text start="615.279" dur="6.24">hide behind labor concerns to avoid</text>
  <text start="618.339" dur="5.971">ratification now most likely to put</text>
  <text start="621.519" dur="5.76">pressure on Pelosi Trump has informed</text>
  <text start="624.31" dur="4.44">amlo that Pelosi is trying to kill any</text>
  <text start="627.279" dur="3.901">US MCA pact</text>
  <text start="628.75" dur="5.67">simply because she&amp;#39;s attempting to</text>
  <text start="631.18" dur="6.3">derail the US economy for maximum 2020</text>
  <text start="634.42" dur="5.039">political benefit now of course we know</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="4.799">this is exactly what she&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="639.459" dur="6.24">now this 44 billion investment package</text>
  <text start="642.279" dur="5.37">is why AM Lo has been willing to assist</text>

  <text start="657.16" dur="6.109">combination with prior Asian agreements</text>
  <text start="659.829" dur="7.62">is the economic breech that drains China</text>

  <text start="679.05" dur="6.55">hmm drug cartels didn&amp;#39;t we just hear</text>
  <text start="683.47" dur="3.66">about this from Trump where he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="687.13" dur="4.62">organization we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that</text>
  <text start="689.29" dur="6.299">in the next report now if all goes</text>
  <text start="691.75" dur="4.99">according to plan the plan that Trump</text>
  <text start="695.589" dur="3.821">and AMLO have</text>
  <text start="696.74" dur="6.86">we&amp;#39;ll give Wall Streets us investment in</text>
  <text start="699.41" dur="6.9">China an alternative in Mexico and</text>
  <text start="703.6" dur="5.859">that&amp;#39;s the cornerstone that allows Trump</text>
  <text start="706.31" dur="7.469">to begin a more consequential decoupling</text>
