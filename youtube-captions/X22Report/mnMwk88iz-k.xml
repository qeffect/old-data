  <text start="278.4" dur="4.65">can&amp;#39;t go anywhere at this point</text>
  <text start="280.039" dur="5.141">something dramatically has to change we</text>
  <text start="283.05" dur="3.72">need a reset we need to wipe out all</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="5.16">this debt not even talk about the amount</text>

  <text start="298.8" dur="8.04">blame the crash of the economy on Trump</text>
  <text start="302.84" dur="6.34">so Trump is out there trying to switch</text>
  <text start="306.84" dur="4.319">the whole thing around on the central</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="4.68">bank because he&amp;#39;s going to be saying</text>

  <text start="313.86" dur="3.42">think he&amp;#39;s finished I we have</text>

  <text start="321.36" dur="3.029">listen it&amp;#39;s all over that out in the</text>
  <text start="322.83" dur="3.45">corporate media it&amp;#39;s out in the</text>
  <text start="324.389" dur="5.761">alternative media they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="326.28" dur="7.669">creating jobs like crazy and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.15" dur="7.68">telling me that the economy just crashed</text>
  <text start="333.949" dur="8.231">well I was trying to improve it what did</text>
  <text start="337.83" dur="7.649">you do that made this happen so it looks</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="6.51">like at this point he is trapping the</text>
  <text start="345.479" dur="7.111">central bank he needs to do this because</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="6.87">he understands the economy needs to be</text>
  <text start="352.59" dur="5.94">completely reset he understands that the</text>
  <text start="355.56" dur="6.93">economy is deteriorating he understands</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="6.12">that without this the economy can&amp;#39;t move</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="4.44">forward now is it going to be painless</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="5.37">know it&amp;#39;s going to be very painful as we</text>
  <text start="366.93" dur="5.7">go through this economic collapse and it</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="4.47">looks like he&amp;#39;s setting it up so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="4.289">going to be very tough to blame it on</text>
  <text start="374.49" dur="5.79">him we see the Empire fed manufacturing</text>
  <text start="376.919" dur="5.97">survey well that has declined at miss</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="6.15">expectations and it was revised lower</text>
  <text start="382.889" dur="7.021">and the Fed printed 6.5 missing</text>
  <text start="386.43" dur="7.95">expectations of 8.5 and it was revised</text>
  <text start="389.91" dur="6.66">lower in December at 7.6 from 9.0 and it</text>
  <text start="394.38" dur="4.59">looks like things are starting to move</text>
  <text start="396.57" dur="5.52">the opposite way we see new orders also</text>
  <text start="398.97" dur="5.91">tumbled so things aren&amp;#39;t going as well</text>
  <text start="402.09" dur="5.28">now if you notice the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="404.88" dur="6.42">out there and they keep saying that this</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="6.21">is Trump euphoria Trump is making the</text>
  <text start="411.3" dur="4.41">stock market go up Trump is doing this</text>
  <text start="413.58" dur="4.8">and it looks like when the crash comes</text>
  <text start="415.71" dur="5.94">they want to say oh the trunk euphoria</text>
  <text start="418.38" dur="5.46">it just died because it looks like</text>
  <text start="421.65" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re setting him up at the same time</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="6.72">he&amp;#39;s setting them up now Trump is making</text>
  <text start="428.16" dur="4.74">good on his promise to slash government</text>
  <text start="430.56" dur="7.56">and it looks like what he&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="432.9" dur="7.59">here is he&amp;#39;s going to cut the staff by</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="5.16">twenty percent and that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="440.49" dur="5.19">completely rock Washington if he</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="4.569">actually follows through and he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="445.68" dur="5.319">to cut spending by</text>
  <text start="447.849" dur="5.011">ten percent which is not that much but</text>
  <text start="450.999" dur="6.48">we can feel already he&amp;#39;s putting</text>
  <text start="452.86" dur="10.459">everything in motion here now fed brain</text>
  <text start="457.479" dur="11.61">art is warning that trumps stimulus</text>
  <text start="463.319" dur="8.86">could be a major problem and she warned</text>
  <text start="469.089" dur="6.03">that these policies do not affect the</text>
  <text start="472.179" dur="5.76">economy&amp;#39;s long-term growth potential but</text>
  <text start="475.119" dur="4.83">do result in persistent fiscal deficits</text>
  <text start="477.939" dur="4.921">they can lead to substantial increase in</text>
  <text start="479.949" dur="5.19">the debt to GDP ratio reducing the space</text>
  <text start="482.86" dur="5.13">for fiscal policy to stabilize the</text>
  <text start="485.139" dur="6.48">economy in the event of future adverse</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="6">shocks so the Fed is out there saying</text>
  <text start="491.619" dur="7.25">that you know what Trump is doing well</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="8.149">there could be huge problems now the</text>
  <text start="498.869" dur="7.84">Government Accountability chief</text>
  <text start="502.139" dur="6.851">Comptroller General Jean dou darou he is</text>
  <text start="506.709" dur="5.341">warning that the photo the federal</text>
  <text start="508.99" dur="7.709">government is on an unsustainable fiscal</text>
  <text start="512.05" dur="9.929">path as a result of decades of runaway</text>
  <text start="516.699" dur="11.58">spending far exceeding revenues ah the</text>
  <text start="521.979" dur="8.04">truth just came out what he&amp;#39;s saying is</text>
  <text start="528.279" dur="4.471">the government is spending a lot more</text>
  <text start="530.019" dur="5.01">money than what is being brought into</text>
  <text start="532.75" dur="3.839">the government that means every time the</text>
  <text start="535.029" dur="4.62">corporate media is out there telling you</text>
  <text start="536.589" dur="4.261">how great tax revenues are actually</text>
  <text start="539.649" dur="3.141">they&amp;#39;re just giving you a number you</text>
  <text start="540.85" dur="4.859">can&amp;#39;t really gauge it with just a number</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="4.239">what he is saying is that there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="545.709" dur="3.841">enough revenue coming into the</text>
  <text start="547.029" dur="10.021">government compared to how much they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="10.74">spending and he went on to say that the</text>
  <text start="557.05" dur="8.209">current federal deficit is 587 billion</text>
  <text start="560.29" dur="7.62">and it&amp;#39;s up from 439 billion for 2015</text>
  <text start="565.259" dur="4.51">the report attributed the increase in</text>
  <text start="567.91" dur="4.849">the annual deficit to higher spending</text>
  <text start="569.769" dur="7.05">for Social Security Medicare Medicaid</text>
  <text start="572.759" dur="6.671">interest on the debt he said I remain</text>
  <text start="576.819" dur="4.371">deeply concerned about our governments</text>
  <text start="579.43" dur="5.21">unsustainable long</text>
  <text start="581.19" dur="5.88">term fiscal path and he&amp;#39;s worried about</text>
  <text start="584.64" dur="7.74">this because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="587.07" dur="8.64">is that if the interest rates move up</text>
  <text start="592.38" dur="6.15">just a little bit the government will</text>
  <text start="595.71" dur="6.45">not be able to pay off the interest on</text>
  <text start="598.53" dur="7.26">the debt because the debt is continually</text>
  <text start="602.16" dur="7.02">rising just in the year of 2016 and went</text>
  <text start="605.79" dur="5.55">up another trillion dollars if it goes</text>
  <text start="609.18" dur="4.77">up another trillion next year and</text>
  <text start="611.34" dur="4.8">another trillion the government is going</text>
  <text start="613.95" dur="4.35">to have a very difficult time paying any</text>
  <text start="616.14" dur="6.3">of this back because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="618.3" dur="7.16">right now is more companies more retail</text>
  <text start="622.44" dur="6.62">stores they are continually laying off</text>
  <text start="625.46" dur="8.29">individuals they&amp;#39;re closing which means</text>
  <text start="629.06" dur="6.46">less revenue into the government I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="633.75" dur="3.42">getting word that there is more and more</text>
  <text start="635.52" dur="3.06">people writing in to me telling me that</text>
  <text start="637.17" dur="3.15">they just got laid off from their</text>
  <text start="638.58" dur="4.32">high-paying great job that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="640.32" dur="5.58">working for different companies between</text>
  <text start="642.9" dur="8.73">10 15 20 years and they would just let</text>
  <text start="645.9" dur="7.77">go and this is a major problem remember</text>
  <text start="651.63" dur="4.95">nothing has changed in the economy</text>
  <text start="653.67" dur="6.24">whatsoever Trump has not done a thing</text>
  <text start="656.58" dur="6.33">yet he&amp;#39;s not even in office yes he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="659.91" dur="4.59">telling different manufacturers and</text>
  <text start="662.91" dur="3.81">companies that he&amp;#39;s going to impose a</text>
  <text start="664.5" dur="4.74">border tax he&amp;#39;s going to be doing this</text>
  <text start="666.72" dur="5.25">he&amp;#39;s going to be doing that but nothing</text>
  <text start="669.24" dur="5.01">has really changed what yes things have</text>
  <text start="671.97" dur="6.09">changed since the beginning of the this</text>
  <text start="674.25" dur="8.94">year we&amp;#39;ve seen more stores close more</text>
  <text start="678.06" dur="6.84">layoffs and they&amp;#39;re continuing because</text>
  <text start="683.19" dur="5.91">this holiday season was a complete</text>
  <text start="684.9" dur="9.27">disaster and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="689.1" dur="9.72">is that again Trump he is protecting</text>
  <text start="694.17" dur="8.55">himself remember he knows how to go</text>
  <text start="698.82" dur="7.95">through a default of bankruptcy he knows</text>
  <text start="702.72" dur="6.63">what to do and he&amp;#39;s preparing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="706.77" dur="5.98">getting ready to deal with the</text>
  <text start="709.35" dur="7.51">defaulting country now</text>
  <text start="712.75" dur="8.19">in the UK Theresa May is out there and</text>
  <text start="716.86" dur="6.09">she is preparing to make a speech that</text>
  <text start="720.94" dur="4.59">will signal that Britain will make a</text>
  <text start="722.95" dur="5.4">clean break from the European Union</text>
  <text start="725.53" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re not seeking to remain half in</text>

  <text start="730.93" dur="5.58">membership they want to be out</text>
  <text start="733.12" dur="5.1">completely and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="736.51" dur="3.87">going to be going forward with this I</text>
  <text start="738.22" dur="6.15">believe in March they&amp;#39;re supposed to be</text>
  <text start="740.38" dur="6.42">implementing article 50 and this will</text>
  <text start="744.37" dur="5.07">sever all ties with the EU and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="746.8" dur="6.24">many other countries that are planning</text>
