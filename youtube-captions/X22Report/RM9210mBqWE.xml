  <text start="136.91" dur="4.65">the central bankers want and what we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="177.05" dur="8.07">breakdown of the housing market which we</text>
  <text start="181.909" dur="4.621">knew was coming what they did was they</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="5.13">created these</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="6.12">bubbles and what they&amp;#39;re doing now with</text>
  <text start="190.25" dur="4.709">the unwind the Fed is unwinding their</text>
  <text start="192.65" dur="4.59">balance sheet and with them raising</text>
  <text start="194.959" dur="5.911">interest rates very very slowly they are</text>
  <text start="197.24" dur="6.079">shutting down the housing market they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="5.76">done this before this is nothing new and</text>
  <text start="203.319" dur="5.261">they&amp;#39;re doing this on purpose but</text>
  <text start="206.63" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re doing it very slowly making sure</text>
  <text start="208.58" dur="5.07">that no one realizes what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="5.46">on and you have to remember we are in a</text>
  <text start="213.65" dur="5.61">battle right now of who is going to</text>
  <text start="216.08" dur="5.129">maintain the narrative who is going to</text>
  <text start="219.26" dur="3.509">blame who of why the economy is coming</text>
  <text start="221.209" dur="5.041">down and what people are getting</text>
  <text start="222.769" dur="5.611">confused of is that this system that</text>
  <text start="226.25" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re in this economic system that we</text>
  <text start="228.38" dur="5.97">are in this is not for the people this</text>
  <text start="232.1" dur="4.169">does not benefit the people yes there</text>
  <text start="234.35" dur="5.07">are certain people that make out on the</text>
  <text start="236.269" dur="6.591">deal but as time goes on it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="239.42" dur="5.849">get worse for them this system is</text>
  <text start="242.86" dur="6.18">created for the central banking system</text>
  <text start="245.269" dur="7.411">this system supports the deep state and</text>
  <text start="249.04" dur="6.94">what is happening right now is is that</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="7.32">the Trump administration the Patriots in</text>
  <text start="255.98" dur="5.87">there they are pushing to bring the</text>
  <text start="260" dur="5.419">system down and control the narrative</text>
  <text start="261.85" dur="6.25">now we understand he already started</text>
  <text start="265.419" dur="5.351">saying that you know we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="268.1" dur="7.23">tariffs on steel and I explained what</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="7.05">will happen if this moves forward we saw</text>
  <text start="275.33" dur="3.87">it happen with bush where the market</text>
  <text start="277.82" dur="3.719">started to come down everything started</text>
  <text start="279.2" dur="6">to fall apart he talked about reciprocal</text>
  <text start="281.539" dur="7.471">taxes and he said when our country taxes</text>
  <text start="285.2" dur="5.49">our products coming in at say 50% and we</text>
  <text start="289.01" dur="5.13">taxed the same product coming into our</text>
  <text start="290.69" dur="6.66">country at zero it is not fair it is not</text>
  <text start="294.14" dur="6.05">smart he said soon we&amp;#39;ll be starting</text>
  <text start="297.35" dur="5.9">reciprocal taxes where we&amp;#39;ll be taxing</text>
  <text start="300.19" dur="7.06">50% just like they&amp;#39;re taxing us 50%</text>
  <text start="303.25" dur="8.95">think about why we weren&amp;#39;t taxing</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="8.84">anything think about why this was the</text>
  <text start="312.2" dur="8">way it was because the central banks</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="6.54">they own the system this is their system</text>
  <text start="320.2" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s not to benefit the country it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="322.63" dur="6.3">the benefit the people it&amp;#39;s not to</text>
  <text start="326.35" dur="4.92">benefit anything like that the benefit</text>
  <text start="328.93" dur="3.9">is to the Central Bank the benefit is to</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="3.96">the deep state this is why they set up</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="4.86">NAFTA this is why they wanted the TPP</text>
  <text start="335.23" dur="5.88">this is why they set the system the way</text>
  <text start="337.69" dur="5.73">it is it wasn&amp;#39;t to benefit everyone here</text>
  <text start="341.11" dur="6.27">and what&amp;#39;s happening right now is</text>
  <text start="343.42" dur="7.44">everything is getting thrown up in the</text>
  <text start="347.38" dur="6.42">air their system needs to be brought</text>
  <text start="350.86" dur="7.32">down if we are going to make a major</text>
  <text start="353.8" dur="7.26">change it can&amp;#39;t be - the system that we</text>
  <text start="358.18" dur="9.54">are in right now this is a central</text>
  <text start="361.06" dur="12.36">bankers system it was signed in in 1913</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="8.75">and then in 1971 it was completed where</text>
  <text start="373.42" dur="6.54">it was a full central banking system</text>
  <text start="376.47" dur="5.23">where they control everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="379.96" dur="5.01">what they wanted no checks and balances</text>
  <text start="381.7" dur="6.27">nothing and it allowed them at that</text>
  <text start="384.97" dur="5.67">point to control a lot of the countries</text>
  <text start="387.97" dur="7.02">with sanctions and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="390.64" dur="5.76">right now is the push to bring down the</text>
  <text start="394.99" dur="3.54">economy the central bankers are doing</text>
  <text start="396.4" dur="5.04">the same thing don&amp;#39;t get me wrong we</text>
  <text start="398.53" dur="5.76">have a battle going on between two</text>
  <text start="401.44" dur="5.45">factions the Trump administration the</text>
  <text start="404.29" dur="6.6">Patriots there and the central banking</text>
  <text start="406.89" dur="5.59">establishment they know their system is</text>
  <text start="410.89" dur="3.57">dead in the water they know that they</text>
  <text start="412.48" dur="4.95">can&amp;#39;t do anything with this system they</text>
  <text start="414.46" dur="6.15">spent many many years moving everything</text>
  <text start="417.43" dur="6.63">out of this country manufacturing the</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="6.06">payment system gold you name it has been</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="4.8">moved out of this country it took a very</text>
  <text start="426.67" dur="5.64">long time to do this because they know</text>
  <text start="428.86" dur="6.33">and they know how long it takes for</text>
  <text start="432.31" dur="6.12">their system to die once we are on a</text>
  <text start="435.19" dur="4.77">full Fiat system usually between 4045</text>
  <text start="438.43" dur="4.59">years they might be able to extend a</text>
  <text start="439.96" dur="4.32">little bit like they did in 2008 where</text>
  <text start="443.02" dur="4.14">they started quantitative easing which</text>
  <text start="444.28" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before because all they</text>
  <text start="447.16" dur="6.18">did was monetize the entire economic</text>
  <text start="450.07" dur="4.02">system to keep it afloat and manipulate</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="3.12">this the</text>
  <text start="454.09" dur="4.53">mystical numbers that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="456.46" dur="5.459">been doing the rest of the economy is</text>
  <text start="458.62" dur="6.99">dead you might think it&amp;#39;s not but it</text>
  <text start="461.919" dur="5.821">really is actually prior to 2008 no one</text>
  <text start="465.61" dur="3.9">had any clue that the economic system</text>
  <text start="467.74" dur="5.459">was dead in the water</text>
  <text start="469.51" dur="5.81">that AIG Lehman Bear Stearns Goldman</text>
  <text start="473.199" dur="5.041">Sachs Bank of it they&amp;#39;re all bankrupt</text>
  <text start="475.32" dur="5.849">they should have been wiped off the face</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="5.489">of the earth but they&amp;#39;re still here</text>
  <text start="481.169" dur="5.621">because they couldn&amp;#39;t let that happen</text>
  <text start="483.729" dur="4.981">and it wasn&amp;#39;t to help the people it</text>
  <text start="486.79" dur="5.93">wasn&amp;#39;t to help anything except</text>
  <text start="488.71" dur="7.35">themselves and here we are right now and</text>
  <text start="492.72" dur="6.009">by placing these tariffs by placing the</text>
  <text start="496.06" dur="5.37">reciprocal taxes by doing all this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.729" dur="6.451">to bring and get us out of this system</text>
  <text start="501.43" dur="6.15">to crash it and bring it down and I</text>
  <text start="505.18" dur="6.09">think what he&amp;#39;s hoping for is that</text>
  <text start="507.58" dur="6.769">countries start to dump the Treasuries</text>
  <text start="511.27" dur="5.84">much faster than they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="514.349" dur="5.161">Japan has been dumping Treasuries</text>
  <text start="517.11" dur="5.41">actually overall</text>
  <text start="519.51" dur="6.34">countries have been dumping Treasuries</text>
  <text start="522.52" dur="5.58">actually the the entities that have been</text>
  <text start="525.85" dur="5.58">buying the Treasuries are private</text>
  <text start="528.1" dur="8.51">investors domestic and abroad to soak up</text>
  <text start="531.43" dur="8.52">the debt and we see right now this is</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="7.32">the only reason the system is being kept</text>
  <text start="539.95" dur="7.079">afloat is because they have manipulated</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="6.279">almost everything look at the stock</text>
  <text start="547.029" dur="5.31">market they&amp;#39;re pumping funds into the</text>
  <text start="550.209" dur="5.611">stock market pushing buttons do keep it</text>
  <text start="552.339" dur="5.761">up to make everyone believe that the</text>
  <text start="555.82" dur="4.019">economy is doing well and when countries</text>
  <text start="558.1" dur="5.609">and central banks in countries start to</text>
  <text start="559.839" dur="6.271">dump the Treasuries guess what the</text>
  <text start="563.709" dur="4.741">system starts to fall apart this is what</text>
  <text start="566.11" dur="4.11">Trump is trying to do this is what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="568.45" dur="4.53">trying to show everyone that the system</text>
  <text start="570.22" dur="6.119">is completely dead in the water he wants</text>
  <text start="572.98" dur="5.94">to destroy it this system can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="576.339" dur="5.011">rebuilt it&amp;#39;s a system that we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="578.92" dur="6.51">the central bank needs to be removed</text>
  <text start="581.35" dur="6.69">and this is the plan now the Rothschilds</text>
  <text start="585.43" dur="4.26">well they&amp;#39;re passing their dynasty on</text>
  <text start="588.04" dur="4.32">to the seventh generation this is</text>
  <text start="589.69" dur="6.63">marking 200 years of banker family rule</text>
  <text start="592.36" dur="5.61">now David de Rothschild 75 is set to</text>
  <text start="596.32" dur="2.09">hand the role of chairman over to his</text>
  <text start="597.97" dur="3.809">son</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="6.929">Alexandre de Rothschild 37 in June and</text>
  <text start="601.779" dur="6.691">they control pretty much everything and</text>
  <text start="605.339" dur="4.721">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a lot of</text>
  <text start="608.47" dur="2.94">politicians are intertwined with the</text>
  <text start="610.06" dur="4.68">Rothschilds that get paid off by the</text>
  <text start="611.41" dur="5.76">Rothschilds and we see that they are</text>
  <text start="614.74" dur="5.01">preparing and getting ready to move</text>
  <text start="617.17" dur="4.74">their system out east this is why when</text>
  <text start="619.75" dur="6.06">you look at China who has all the</text>
  <text start="621.91" dur="6.45">manufacturing who has the gold who is</text>
  <text start="625.81" dur="5.88">the payment system who has the trading</text>
  <text start="628.36" dur="6.39">systems who has the belton road which is</text>
  <text start="631.69" dur="7.79">being set up right now to basically</text>
  <text start="634.75" dur="7.829">trade with every single country China</text>
  <text start="639.48" dur="6.43">they want to establish their new system</text>
  <text start="642.579" dur="6.481">there and it doesn&amp;#39;t mean oh they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="645.91" dur="5.669">line with China it means that they spoke</text>
  <text start="649.06" dur="4.98">to them that they&amp;#39;re gonna set up shop</text>
  <text start="651.579" dur="5.37">there everything will be worked out of</text>
  <text start="654.04" dur="4.14">there because the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="656.949" dur="2.971">don&amp;#39;t care what country it is they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="658.18" dur="3">care if it&amp;#39;s China Russia they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="659.92" dur="4.469">care what United States they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="661.18" dur="7.2">where it is as long as they can control</text>
  <text start="664.389" dur="8.01">the creation of currency and this is</text>
  <text start="668.38" dur="6.149">where the battle comes in because what</text>
  <text start="672.399" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re looking at is two different</text>
  <text start="674.529" dur="4.11">systems a people system which I do</text>
  <text start="677.079" dur="4.56">believe is the crypto currency system</text>
  <text start="678.639" dur="5.041">and the central banking system which is</text>
  <text start="681.639" dur="4.291">the fayette system this is why the</text>
  <text start="683.68" dur="6">central bankers have been pushing the</text>
  <text start="685.93" dur="6.42">idea so hard so long to make you believe</text>
  <text start="689.68" dur="6.23">that crypto currencies is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="692.35" dur="7.739">completely evil and you don&amp;#39;t want it</text>
  <text start="695.91" dur="7.989">because they know if people realize what</text>
  <text start="700.089" dur="5.37">it really is and how it works and the</text>
  <text start="703.899" dur="3.781">central bankers are not needed and the</text>
  <text start="705.459" dur="3.81">bankers are not needed people would</text>
  <text start="707.68" dur="3.649">latch on to it like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow</text>
  <text start="709.269" dur="5.401">and say whoa wait a minute</text>
  <text start="711.329" dur="5.681">governments would say hey why don&amp;#39;t we</text>
