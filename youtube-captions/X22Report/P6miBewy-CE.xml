  <text start="62.17" dur="5.7">January 15th 2018 and thus out of the</text>
  <text start="65.14" dur="5.01">episode is all the theories about the</text>
  <text start="67.87" dur="5.82">deteriorating economy are now becoming</text>
  <text start="70.15" dur="6.6">facts let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.69" dur="6.06">collapse financial news now as we can</text>
  <text start="76.75" dur="6.09">see the retail industry it&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="79.75" dur="4.83">as well as the core media makes it seem</text>
  <text start="82.84" dur="3.3">like it&amp;#39;s doing and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="84.58" dur="4.08">telling us that you know retail is</text>
  <text start="86.14" dur="5.28">bouncing back thank god this for this</text>
  <text start="88.66" dur="5.099">holiday season the retail apocalypse it</text>
  <text start="91.42" dur="3.6">looks like it could be over and this is</text>
  <text start="93.759" dur="3.541">something that the retailer&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="95.02" dur="5.01">needed and then we see that Macy&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="97.3" dur="4.62">many other stores Neiman Marcus some are</text>
  <text start="100.03" dur="4.38">closing stores some are declaring</text>
  <text start="101.92" dur="4.979">bankruptcy we see Walmart is eliminating</text>
  <text start="104.41" dur="4.53">about a thousand jobs we know that there</text>
  <text start="106.899" dur="5.311">all of a sudden they closed you know</text>
  <text start="108.94" dur="5.64">something like 260 Sam&amp;#39;s Club warehouses</text>
  <text start="112.21" dur="5.749">or something like that and it looks like</text>
  <text start="114.58" dur="7.92">there&amp;#39;s gonna be 11 thousand jobs lost</text>
  <text start="117.959" dur="6.311">for Walmart and that is a lot of people</text>
  <text start="122.5" dur="3.78">that are going to be out of work now</text>
  <text start="124.27" dur="3.93">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all this</text>
  <text start="126.28" dur="4.73">is that the corporate media was making a</text>
  <text start="128.2" dur="6.36">really big deal about the credit card</text>
  <text start="131.01" dur="5.02">spending the debt spending over the</text>
  <text start="134.56" dur="4.35">holiday season and this is what they</text>
  <text start="136.03" dur="3.66">used to gauge how the holiday season was</text>
  <text start="138.91" dur="1.86">doing and they came out with their</text>
  <text start="139.69" dur="3.629">numbers and all four point nine percent</text>
  <text start="140.77" dur="4.71">or whatever they came out with and they</text>
  <text start="143.319" dur="5.67">were trying to convince us that this is</text>
  <text start="145.48" dur="4.77">something that looks fantastic everyone</text>
  <text start="148.989" dur="4.321">is going out and spending their money</text>
  <text start="150.25" dur="5.01">and we realized that you know people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.31" dur="3.179">savings were declining and what were</text>
  <text start="155.26" dur="3.03">people really spending their money on</text>
  <text start="156.489" dur="3.541">using their credit cards because as we</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="4.919">know it wasn&amp;#39;t just for the holiday</text>
  <text start="160.03" dur="5.16">season well if we go back a little bit</text>
  <text start="163.209" dur="5.101">Joseph Borg director of the Alabama</text>
  <text start="165.19" dur="5.07">security Commission he suggested that</text>
  <text start="168.31" dur="5.31">people were taking out home equity loans</text>
  <text start="170.26" dur="5.369">and cash advances on credit cards to</text>
  <text start="173.62" dur="4.41">make Bitcoin purchases now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="175.629" dur="5.401">interesting about this is that it seems</text>
  <text start="178.03" dur="5.46">like he turned out to be right and he</text>
  <text start="181.03" dur="5.16">looked into this and he saw that it</text>
  <text start="183.49" dur="3.54">looks like the speculation which what he</text>
  <text start="186.19" dur="4.47">which he was too</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="5.91">thing about is now confirmed because</text>
  <text start="190.66" dur="4.65">there was a new survey conducted by Len</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="4.98">DTU which found that among other things</text>
  <text start="195.31" dur="5.97">nearly 20% of people who have purchased</text>
  <text start="197.92" dur="7.14">Bitcoin have done so using their credit</text>
  <text start="201.28" dur="7.86">cards now once again we saw credit card</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="6.48">levels rise at the same time Bitcoin was</text>
  <text start="209.14" dur="4.47">going up very very quickly and of course</text>
  <text start="211.54" dur="3.66">everyone saw this and they said oh I got</text>
  <text start="213.61" dur="3.84">to get into this I want to make some</text>
  <text start="215.2" dur="5.19">money off of this now what they saw was</text>
  <text start="217.45" dur="5.34">first more than half 51 point seven</text>
  <text start="220.39" dur="5.25">eight percent a respondent stated that</text>
  <text start="222.79" dur="4.62">they either used a credit or debit card</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="4.59">to fund their account to purchase</text>
  <text start="227.41" dur="4.95">Bitcoin specifically thirty three point</text>
  <text start="230.23" dur="4.229">six three percent of investors were</text>
  <text start="232.36" dur="6.09">using debit cards while eighteen percent</text>
  <text start="234.459" dur="7.261">were using credit cards and this was a</text>
  <text start="238.45" dur="5.759">factor in having the credit the debit</text>
  <text start="241.72" dur="4.56">cards move up to four point nine percent</text>
  <text start="244.209" dur="3.591">because when we look at the real sales</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="5.25">and we talked about this before the</text>
  <text start="247.8" dur="6.189">actual holiday sales are not that great</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="4.769">this is why stores are closing down this</text>
  <text start="253.989" dur="4.801">is why more and more stores are gonna</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="5.341">declare bankruptcy because the actual</text>
  <text start="258.79" dur="5.82">sales the actual profits they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="261.64" dur="4.17">not there now there was another report</text>
  <text start="264.61" dur="4.23">out there and we talked about the</text>
  <text start="265.81" dur="5.28">Student Loan debacle here where a lot of</text>
  <text start="268.84" dur="3.51">people are taking up student loans they</text>
  <text start="271.09" dur="3.66">were promised you know they were gonna</text>
  <text start="272.35" dur="4.92">get this great job when they graduated</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="6.39">and we see that this has not come true</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="6">at all and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="281.14" dur="4.38">government you know everyone is out</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="3.69">there get a good education once you get</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="3.45">this good education you can go out and</text>
  <text start="286.96" dur="4.41">you get this great job and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="4.17">seeing is a lot of these individuals who</text>
  <text start="291.37" dur="3.03">are going for this education they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.14" dur="3.029">living with their parents they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="4.65">find a job they can&amp;#39;t pay for their</text>
  <text start="296.169" dur="4.981">student loans the student loans have</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="3.66">been modified over time they look at</text>
  <text start="301.15" dur="3.6">your income then they modify it over</text>
  <text start="302.71" dur="3.87">time so you can make these payments and</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="4.14">the only reason they do these things is</text>
  <text start="306.58" dur="4.5">because the system is not working this</text>
  <text start="308.89" dur="4.5">is why they have to modify all of this</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="5.43">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="313.39" dur="6.269">total student loan debt is around one</text>
  <text start="316.51" dur="4.14">point four eight trillion and nearly 50%</text>
  <text start="319.659" dur="4.921">more than</text>
  <text start="320.65" dur="6.15">all credit card debt in America now we</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="4.32">can see that this number one point four</text>
  <text start="326.8" dur="5.73">eight trillion this is going to reach</text>
  <text start="328.9" dur="5.72">three point three trillion by 2024 and</text>
  <text start="332.53" dur="5.07">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="334.62" dur="7.15">Brookings Institution reports the</text>
  <text start="337.6" dur="7.439">following that the student default</text>
  <text start="341.77" dur="6.149">crisis is much much worse than we</text>
  <text start="345.039" dur="5.94">thought and when they looked into this</text>
  <text start="347.919" dur="5.481">they say that nearly 40% of borrowers</text>
  <text start="350.979" dur="7.051">may default on their student loans by</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="8.65">2023 a this is a staggering number if</text>
  <text start="358.03" dur="5.88">one assumes the DBA sees forecast that</text>
  <text start="362.05" dur="4.35">there will be roughly 2.5 trillion in</text>
  <text start="363.91" dur="4.35">student loan outstanding by 2020 it</text>
  <text start="366.4" dur="4.11">would mean that no less than one</text>
  <text start="368.26" dur="4.7">trillion in student loans will be in</text>
  <text start="370.51" dur="5.879">some form of a default in two years an</text>
  <text start="372.96" dur="5.92">outcome which will necessitate guess</text>
  <text start="376.389" dur="5.041">what probably a bailout from the</text>
  <text start="378.88" dur="4.23">taxpayers and if we start to look at all</text>
  <text start="381.43" dur="4.799">this data that&amp;#39;s coming in the student</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="5.52">loans the pension problem we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="386.229" dur="5.12">at the retail crisis we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="388.63" dur="4.98">the housing crisis all these</text>
  <text start="391.349" dur="5.56">institutions all these studies are</text>
  <text start="393.61" dur="4.86">starting to show us that these things</text>
  <text start="396.909" dur="4.081">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at these</text>
  <text start="398.47" dur="5.25">different economic sectors well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.99" dur="4.35">all coming true everything that we</text>
  <text start="403.72" dur="3.479">looked into everything that we thought</text>
  <text start="405.34" dur="4.29">was going to happen when we saw this</text>
  <text start="407.199" dur="5.15">economy deteriorating is actually</text>
  <text start="409.63" dur="4.98">happening because they&amp;#39;re surveying</text>
  <text start="412.349" dur="3.971">different individuals they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="414.61" dur="4.679">what is going on and they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="416.32" dur="6.089">same exact thing now the real estate</text>
  <text start="419.289" dur="4.771">market is falling apart also a lot of</text>
  <text start="422.409" dur="3.091">people can&amp;#39;t see that yet there are</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="3.81">other people that have been writing in</text>
  <text start="425.5" dur="4.889">saying oh yeah I see it in my area now</text>
  <text start="427.87" dur="4.62">prices are coming down traffic&amp;#39;s drying</text>
  <text start="430.389" dur="5.75">up and the realtors they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="432.49" dur="6.929">what&amp;#39;s going on in New York City</text>
  <text start="436.139" dur="6.28">landlords are suddenly in a position of</text>
  <text start="439.419" dur="5.521">having to slash their rental rates to</text>
  <text start="442.419" dur="3.99">attract tenants now according to the</text>
  <text start="444.94" dur="5.67">latest rental report from Douglas</text>
  <text start="446.409" dur="6.781">Elliman median rents in the Big Apple</text>
  <text start="450.61" dur="4.2">dropped by 2.7 percent year-over-year in</text>
  <text start="453.19" dur="3.03">December</text>
  <text start="454.81" dur="6.24">and when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="456.22" dur="9.449">this has been declining steadily since</text>
  <text start="461.05" dur="8.369">around May of 2017 and it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="465.669" dur="7.141">declining at a very very fast pace we</text>
  <text start="469.419" dur="6.72">also see that New York City apartment</text>
  <text start="472.81" dur="7.53">sales they have collapsed by 25% in the</text>
  <text start="476.139" dur="5.731">fourth quarter and this means that New</text>
  <text start="480.34" dur="3.99">Yorkers that are looking to sell their</text>
  <text start="481.87" dur="4.71">apartment are also taking a hit as</text>
  <text start="484.33" dur="5.82">prices have plummeted by negative 9</text>
  <text start="486.58" dur="6.18">point 4 percent and volumes which are</text>
  <text start="490.15" dur="5.25">down by negative twenty five point four</text>
  <text start="492.76" dur="4.379">percent in the for sale market collapsed</text>
  <text start="495.4" dur="5.55">sequentially in the fourth quarter as</text>
  <text start="497.139" dur="8.631">potential buyers took a pause amid the</text>
  <text start="500.95" dur="8.43">growing uncertainty of the economy and</text>
  <text start="505.77" dur="5.619">we see also that resale volumes were</text>
  <text start="509.38" dur="4.92">down a staggering twenty six point nine</text>
  <text start="511.389" dur="4.65">percent as well so when we start to look</text>
  <text start="514.3" dur="4.859">at all of this we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="516.039" dur="5.55">that yes all of this is becoming fact</text>
  <text start="519.159" dur="3.901">it&amp;#39;s no longer sitting there going oh</text>
  <text start="521.589" dur="3.481">look what&amp;#39;s happening here even though</text>
  <text start="523.06" dur="2.88">the corporate media the Fed the</text>
  <text start="525.07" dur="2.7">government is telling us something</text>
  <text start="525.94" dur="3.42">different we&amp;#39;re starting to see all</text>
  <text start="527.77" dur="4.08">these numbers we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="529.36" dur="3.81">information come in that all the things</text>

  <text start="533.17" dur="3.78">that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing it&amp;#39;s all coming</text>
  <text start="535.06" dur="5.04">true now if we look at the commercial</text>

  <text start="582.85" dur="3.87">start to look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="584.14" dur="3.75">there are major major problems now if we</text>
  <text start="586.72" dur="1.859">look at the brick-and-mortar retail</text>

  <text start="667.869" dur="4.41">the economy has come down before back in</text>
  <text start="670.449" dur="4.531">2008 everyone was clapping their hands</text>
  <text start="672.279" dur="5.16">oh my god we hit 14,000 points the party</text>
  <text start="674.98" dur="4.5">will never end and it ended go back to</text>
  <text start="677.439" dur="4.74">the 70s when it finally hit a thousand</text>
  <text start="679.48" dur="5.009">points it ended go back to 1929 when it</text>
  <text start="682.179" dur="3.96">finally hit like 300 or 400 people were</text>
  <text start="684.489" dur="3.75">like unbelievable this is incredible</text>

  <text start="688.239" dur="6.301">finally ended the stock market is</text>
  <text start="691.199" dur="4.75">absolutely meaningless has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="694.54" dur="4.529">with the real economy especially today</text>
  <text start="695.949" dur="6.69">because we know the central banks have</text>
  <text start="699.069" dur="6">been manipulating the stock market and</text>
  <text start="702.639" dur="4.74">they can do it very very well today all</text>
  <text start="705.069" dur="4.5">they need to do is create free money out</text>
  <text start="707.379" dur="4.591">of thin air and buy the stocks</text>
  <text start="709.569" dur="5.39">this is not real people this is not</text>
  <text start="711.97" dur="6.75">retail investors these are central banks</text>
  <text start="714.959" dur="7.361">keeping the illusion alive while</text>
  <text start="718.72" dur="5.49">governments manipulate the numbers</text>
  <text start="722.32" dur="4.44">keep everyone in the dark until the very</text>
  <text start="724.21" dur="5.67">very end this is what happens every</text>
  <text start="726.76" dur="5.88">single time and we&amp;#39;re being kept in the</text>
  <text start="729.88" dur="4.02">dark just like in 2008 when every</text>
  <text start="732.64" dur="4.11">thought everyone thought the real-estate</text>
  <text start="733.9" dur="5.73">market could never implode the subprime</text>
  <text start="736.75" dur="5.85">securities were all triple-a the retail</text>
  <text start="739.63" dur="5.4">industry was doing well nobody had to</text>
  <text start="742.6" dur="5.04">worry the automobile manufacturers were</text>
  <text start="745.03" dur="5.25">fantastic all the companies were doing</text>
  <text start="747.64" dur="4.83">well the banks were solid nobody needed</text>
  <text start="750.28" dur="4.59">any type of bailout and then we come to</text>
  <text start="752.47" dur="5.07">learn it was all a lie all these</text>
  <text start="754.87" dur="5.1">companies the automobile manufacturers</text>
  <text start="757.54" dur="5.64">real estate the triple a subprime</text>
  <text start="759.97" dur="6.66">securities all of it was completely fake</text>
  <text start="763.18" dur="5.82">and they all knew it but they kept the</text>
  <text start="766.63" dur="4.14">illusion alive as long as they possibly</text>
  <text start="769" dur="4.92">could this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="770.77" dur="5.76">now they&amp;#39;re just a lot better at it and</text>
  <text start="773.92" dur="5.49">eventually what happens it all falls</text>
  <text start="776.53" dur="6.77">apart you can&amp;#39;t keep something you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="779.41" dur="7.62">keep lying and have nothing happen</text>
  <text start="783.3" dur="6.34">something always breaks and something</text>
  <text start="787.03" dur="3.6">will break now they don&amp;#39;t want to they</text>
  <text start="789.64" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t want it to break</text>
  <text start="790.63" dur="4.8">without them controlling it that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="793.12" dur="3.51">whole point of this thing because if</text>
  <text start="795.43" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re out of control</text>
  <text start="796.63" dur="3.9">and something else brings it down</text>
  <text start="799.12" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re afraid people are gonna blame</text>
  <text start="800.53" dur="2.43">them because they&amp;#39;re in control of think</text>
  <text start="802.48" dur="4.11">about it</text>
  <text start="802.96" dur="5.67">the stock market the plunge Protection</text>
  <text start="806.59" dur="5.1">Team the stimulus that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="808.63" dur="5.55">using to keep the economy afloat keeping</text>
  <text start="811.69" dur="5.4">the interest rates very low and slowly</text>
  <text start="814.18" dur="5.19">moving them up if the entire system</text>
  <text start="817.09" dur="4.74">falls apart without any type of an event</text>
  <text start="819.37" dur="5.16">that distract everyone everyone&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="821.83" dur="6.24">look at them and this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="824.53" dur="5.22">been rushing against time right now to</text>
  <text start="828.07" dur="3.45">try to get something off the ground</text>
  <text start="829.75" dur="4.11">where they can blame the economy</text>
  <text start="831.52" dur="3.93">completely falling apart and I think</text>
  <text start="833.86" dur="4.56">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is maybe use</text>
  <text start="835.45" dur="5.01">Trump and his administration maybe</text>
  <text start="838.42" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;ll be using a country where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="840.46" dur="4.08">gonna say there&amp;#39;s a cyberattack or if</text>
  <text start="842.59" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s a skirmish someplace else where</text>
  <text start="844.54" dur="3.18">they can say oh this is the reason and</text>
  <text start="846.28" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;ll make something up it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="847.72" dur="3.78">really matter they can blame it on</text>
  <text start="849.13" dur="4.26">Bitcoin saying that a lot of people took</text>
  <text start="851.5" dur="3.99">their credit cards their savings they</text>
  <text start="853.39" dur="3.21">invested it into Bitcoin and all of a</text>
  <text start="855.49" dur="3.31">sudden Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="856.6" dur="4.45">imploded on itself and all these people</text>
  <text start="858.8" dur="3.69">lost their wealth pensions and whatever</text>
  <text start="861.05" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;ll just make things up where</text>
  <text start="862.49" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re saying this is why it all fell</text>
  <text start="864.35" dur="4.62">apart and when we look at this we can</text>
  <text start="866.72" dur="4.55">see that this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="868.97" dur="6.15">trying to do for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="871.27" dur="6.13">here we are today going just in the</text>
  <text start="875.12" dur="4.23">beginning of 2018 as we move throughout</text>
  <text start="877.4" dur="4.47">this year we&amp;#39;re going to see the real</text>
  <text start="879.35" dur="4.5">economy get worse and worse and worse</text>
  <text start="881.87" dur="5.1">and soon what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="883.85" dur="5.04">there&amp;#39;ll be no explanation of why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="886.97" dur="4.68">getting worse they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="888.89" dur="5.67">figure it out of course they&amp;#39;ll start</text>
  <text start="891.65" dur="4.83">maybe having some news about Trump and</text>
  <text start="894.56" dur="4.32">what he&amp;#39;s been doing and this is why the</text>
  <text start="896.48" dur="5.58">economy start to starting to decline</text>
  <text start="898.88" dur="6.15">they might use that they might use</text>
  <text start="902.06" dur="4.74">Bitcoin like I said we don&amp;#39;t know as of</text>
  <text start="905.03" dur="3.81">yet but we will start to see headlines</text>
  <text start="906.8" dur="3.72">and we&amp;#39;ll know what direction they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="908.84" dur="3.9">going in but eventually what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="910.52" dur="5.46">going to do is they&amp;#39;re gonna blame this</text>
  <text start="912.74" dur="6.03">on something or someone else that is</text>
  <text start="915.98" dur="4.56">their plan this is their plan from the</text>
  <text start="918.77" dur="3.33">beginning at this point they really</text>
  <text start="920.54" dur="3.87">thought we were going to be more already</text>
  <text start="922.1" dur="5.04">if Clinton was elected and that would be</text>
  <text start="924.41" dur="4.83">a huge distraction from an economic</text>
  <text start="927.14" dur="4.5">collapse because they can say it was the</text>
  <text start="929.24" dur="3.93">war and this is why everything fell</text>
  <text start="931.64" dur="3.63">apart had nothing to do with us and this</text>
  <text start="933.17" dur="6.24">is what they normally use now they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="935.27" dur="7.59">have that the question is what will they</text>
  <text start="939.41" dur="5.49">use and we see different scenarios but</text>
  <text start="942.86" dur="4.35">no matter what you still have to get</text>
  <text start="944.9" dur="6.36">prepared you need to be ready because</text>
  <text start="947.21" dur="6.03">there is a reset and it&amp;#39;s coming because</text>
  <text start="951.26" dur="4.74">the system cannot be sustained right now</text>
  <text start="953.24" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible and when it</text>
  <text start="956" dur="2.52">all comes to an end all those people are</text>
  <text start="957.5" dur="1.35">saying that it would never come to an</text>
  <text start="958.52" dur="3.03">end</text>
  <text start="958.85" dur="4.53">well they&amp;#39;re gonna be sitting there</text>
  <text start="961.55" dur="3.96">going oh I don&amp;#39;t know what just happened</text>
  <text start="963.38" dur="3.6">right now and hopefully maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="965.51" dur="3.74">not prepared maybe they are prepared</text>
  <text start="966.98" dur="5.04">hopefully they are prepared because</text>
  <text start="969.25" dur="5.29">everyone should be prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="972.02" dur="4.05">coming just like the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="974.54" dur="3.6">people should have been prepared then</text>
  <text start="976.07" dur="4.83">just like in 2008 people should have</text>
  <text start="978.14" dur="4.83">been prepared then this time around they</text>
  <text start="980.9" dur="2.52">didn&amp;#39;t fix anything they didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="982.97" dur="3.78">anything</text>
  <text start="983.42" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s an illusion and the illusion is</text>
  <text start="986.75" dur="3.24">gonna come to an end and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="988.91" dur="3.45">be a lot worse</text>
