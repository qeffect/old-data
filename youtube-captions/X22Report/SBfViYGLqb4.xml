  <text start="108.25" dur="4.77">at many of the economic sectors and</text>
  <text start="111.009" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at many of the</text>
  <text start="113.02" dur="5.93">economic indicators and a lot of them</text>
  <text start="115.99" dur="6.54">are flashing recession some are already</text>
  <text start="118.95" dur="6.279">so bad that we&amp;#39;re flashing a depression</text>
  <text start="122.53" dur="5.76">and one indicator which is unemployment</text>
  <text start="125.229" dur="5.7">well we&amp;#39;re seeing something very</text>
  <text start="128.29" dur="5.759">interesting historically unemployment</text>
  <text start="130.929" dur="6.321">rate lows occurred at or very near to</text>
  <text start="134.049" dur="6.991">market inflection points preceding a</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="8.23">recession now the unemployment rate just</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="8.009">re just released on June 2nd was at 4.2</text>
  <text start="145.48" dur="7.349">9% it is now just below the average</text>
  <text start="149.049" dur="7.651">unemployment entry prior two recessions</text>
  <text start="152.829" dur="6.901">over the last 67 years at four point</text>
  <text start="156.7" dur="8.55">four percent so if we look back in time</text>
  <text start="159.73" dur="9.539">and we go to those years of 2007-2008 we</text>
  <text start="165.25" dur="8.579">go to the years 2000 going into 2001 and</text>
  <text start="169.269" dur="7.111">we go back in time to the 1990s we go</text>
  <text start="173.829" dur="5.281">back in 2008 es we go back into the time</text>
  <text start="176.38" dur="6.9">into 1970s the 60s all the way back in</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="7.29">time what do we see each and every</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="5.97">single time we see each time</text>
  <text start="186.4" dur="6.899">we reach this point in unemployment</text>
  <text start="189.25" dur="7.62">where it is at its lowest point we enter</text>
  <text start="193.299" dur="7.89">either a recession a great recession or</text>
  <text start="196.87" dur="7.319">depression and we are here today at that</text>
  <text start="201.189" dur="6.75">point and it tells us and it&amp;#39;s signaling</text>
  <text start="204.189" dur="6.39">to us that we&amp;#39;re here we are here at the</text>
  <text start="207.939" dur="4.291">point of when we&amp;#39;re going to enter</text>
  <text start="210.579" dur="3.481">recession now I think we&amp;#39;re already in a</text>
  <text start="212.23" dur="4.58">recession everything that I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="5.069">looking at all the economic data is</text>
  <text start="216.81" dur="4.599">telling us that we&amp;#39;ve been in a</text>
  <text start="219.129" dur="4.14">recession and we&amp;#39;re actually heading</text>
  <text start="221.409" dur="4.14">into a depression into a collapse</text>
  <text start="223.269" dur="4.5">scenario remember the government will</text>
  <text start="225.549" dur="3.901">not tell you the central bank definitely</text>
  <text start="227.769" dur="2.97">will not tell you that you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="229.45" dur="3.5">recession you know when they tell you</text>
  <text start="230.739" dur="5.461">you&amp;#39;re in a recession or a depression</text>
  <text start="232.95" dur="6.009">when you&amp;#39;re already in it they go back</text>
  <text start="236.2" dur="4.259">and say oh yeah by the way this started</text>
  <text start="238.959" dur="3.81">about eight months ago for all those</text>
  <text start="240.459" dur="5.071">people that are curious but we just</text>
  <text start="242.769" dur="6.03">figured it out now we&amp;#39;ve been telling</text>
  <text start="245.53" dur="4.919">you that we are here now we know a lot</text>
  <text start="248.799" dur="5.37">of the numbers have been manipulated and</text>
  <text start="250.449" dur="7.41">from Morningside Hill they&amp;#39;ve calculated</text>
  <text start="254.169" dur="6.63">that a full 93 percent of the new jobs</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="5.49">reported since 2008 since the Great</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="4.68">Recession six point three million</text>
  <text start="263.349" dur="4.831">out of the six point seven million and</text>
  <text start="265.479" dur="5.25">forty percent of the jobs in 2016 alone</text>
  <text start="268.18" dur="5.729">were added through the business birth</text>
  <text start="270.729" dur="5.851">and death model now this is a highly</text>
  <text start="273.909" dur="6.121">controversial model which is not</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="5.25">supported by the data all data on the</text>
  <text start="280.03" dur="4.759">establishment birth and death point to</text>
  <text start="281.83" dur="6.089">an ongoing decrease in entrepreneurship</text>
  <text start="284.789" dur="5.31">but what they have done is they are</text>
  <text start="287.919" dur="5.911">using this model saying that</text>
  <text start="290.099" dur="7.151">entrepreneurship is growing over time so</text>
  <text start="293.83" dur="6.51">here&amp;#39;s some information on how they use</text>
  <text start="297.25" dur="5.28">this model so over 90 percent of the</text>
  <text start="300.34" dur="3.9">jobs created in the past decade we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.53" dur="4.59">nothing more than statistical</text>
  <text start="304.24" dur="5.37">adjustments in the BLS model now they</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="4.65">use the birth-death adjustment so in</text>
  <text start="309.61" dur="3.9">order to account for the jobs created or</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="3.93">lost by new business formations or</text>
  <text start="313.51" dur="4.92">bankruptcies each month the BLS</text>
  <text start="315.7" dur="4.62">introduced the birth-death adjustment it</text>
  <text start="318.43" dur="3.69">started during the Reagan and</text>
  <text start="320.32" dur="3.23">ministration because Reagan was</text>
  <text start="322.12" dur="4.62">complaining that the bureau was</text>
  <text start="323.55" dur="5.38">undercounting the jobs that he created</text>
  <text start="326.74" dur="4.14">so they adjusted this model saying okay</text>
  <text start="328.93" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s a lot more businesses that are</text>
  <text start="330.88" dur="3.66">being created they&amp;#39;re very small we</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="5.25">can&amp;#39;t account for them and this is how</text>
  <text start="334.54" dur="4.92">they use it now the birth-death model</text>
  <text start="337.99" dur="4.68">used to have a terrible name it was the</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="6.78">bias adjustment factor so this</text>
  <text start="342.67" dur="7.11">adjustment the way it is computed it</text>
  <text start="346.24" dur="7.17">uses a model based on probability based</text>
  <text start="349.78" dur="7.74">sampling methodology now according to</text>
  <text start="353.41" dur="7.2">the BLS in the depths of the 2007-2009</text>
  <text start="357.52" dur="5.64">recession the birth-death adjustment</text>
  <text start="360.61" dur="6.03">continued to add a lot of jobs 904</text>
  <text start="363.16" dur="5.91">thousand jobs were added in 2009 alone</text>
  <text start="366.64" dur="6.09">now we need to think about what happened</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="6.18">in 2008-2009 because during the Great</text>
  <text start="372.73" dur="5.16">Recession what we see happening a lot of</text>
  <text start="375.25" dur="5.85">businesses are defaulting a lot of</text>
  <text start="377.89" dur="6">businesses went out of business and that</text>
  <text start="381.1" dur="6.63">continually skyrocketed throughout time</text>
  <text start="383.89" dur="6.57">and the birth and death adjustment would</text>
  <text start="387.73" dur="5.58">be a net negative and subtract from the</text>
  <text start="390.46" dur="6.75">overall jobs number instead of adding to</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="6.69">it so it turns out the BLS they wanted</text>
  <text start="397.21" dur="5.82">to include this adjustment because they</text>
  <text start="400" dur="6.63">wanted to make it look like that jobs</text>
  <text start="403.03" dur="7.92">were being created and basically they</text>
  <text start="406.63" dur="6.48">use this even though businesses were</text>
  <text start="410.95" dur="4.43">declining during that period because</text>
  <text start="413.11" dur="5.57">again we have to go back to the original</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="6.73">thought process of this entire system</text>
  <text start="418.68" dur="6.07">during the 80s small businesses were</text>
  <text start="422.11" dur="4.2">being created left and right and Reagan</text>
  <text start="424.75" dur="3.87">was afraid that they were not being</text>
  <text start="426.31" dur="5.13">accounted for and you can see back in</text>
  <text start="428.62" dur="7.86">that time the entire economy was growing</text>
  <text start="431.44" dur="7.71">here businesses have been declining but</text>
  <text start="436.48" dur="5.31">they were still using this model making</text>
  <text start="439.15" dur="5.67">everyone think that businesses were</text>
  <text start="441.79" dur="7.31">popping up in all different places so we</text>
  <text start="444.82" dur="7.56">could see how they skewed the entire</text>
  <text start="449.1" dur="4.869">unemployment numbers by using this model</text>
  <text start="452.38" dur="4.169">so basic</text>
  <text start="453.969" dur="6.02">what has happened is that during this</text>
  <text start="456.549" dur="6.27">period of time using this statistical</text>
  <text start="459.989" dur="5.68">calculation they&amp;#39;re showing us that</text>
  <text start="462.819" dur="5.7">these jobs really don&amp;#39;t exist because</text>
  <text start="465.669" dur="5.63">they&amp;#39;re only there in statistics they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="468.519" dur="4.95">not there in real life and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="471.299" dur="5.8">ninety-three percent of the all jobs</text>
  <text start="473.469" dur="6.12">were created using this method and if</text>
  <text start="477.099" dur="4.32">you subtract out all of this the</text>
  <text start="479.589" dur="5.18">unemployment is not four point two nine</text>
  <text start="481.419" dur="7.35">percent because as we can see that</text>
  <text start="484.769" dur="7.15">businesses per year continually declined</text>
  <text start="488.769" dur="5.01">and they are still declining I mean</text>
  <text start="491.919" dur="4.14">think about what you&amp;#39;re seeing now and a</text>
  <text start="493.779" dur="3.75">much larger scale I mean the small</text>
  <text start="496.059" dur="3.33">businesses you really couldn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="497.529" dur="3.21">because the corporate media really</text>
  <text start="499.389" dur="3.39">doesn&amp;#39;t report on it you don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="500.739" dur="4.621">know how many small businesses there are</text>
  <text start="502.779" dur="4.86">yes the government does because they</text>
  <text start="505.36" dur="3.869">keep track of all this and they realize</text>
  <text start="507.639" dur="3.96">that yes they&amp;#39;re declining but they were</text>
  <text start="509.229" dur="4.05">still using the old model because they</text>
  <text start="511.599" dur="3.03">wanted to make us believe that things</text>
  <text start="513.279" dur="3.36">were getting better this was part of</text>
  <text start="514.629" dur="6.15">their plan now we see it on a much</text>
  <text start="516.639" dur="6.93">larger scale we see retail stores well</text>
  <text start="520.779" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re closing all over the place a lot</text>
  <text start="523.569" dur="3.781">of them are going bankrupt I mean look</text>
  <text start="525.189" dur="4.14">at Gymboree just a couple days ago we</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="4.679">reported on how Gymboree if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="529.329" dur="3.99">make their interest payments what were</text>
  <text start="532.029" dur="2.971">they going to have to do they were going</text>
  <text start="533.319" dur="4.471">to have to declare bankruptcy well guess</text>
  <text start="535" dur="3.689">what they miss their interest payment so</text>
  <text start="537.79" dur="2.43">guess what they&amp;#39;re going to have to do</text>
  <text start="538.689" dur="3.661">right now they have to declare</text>
  <text start="540.22" dur="4.65">bankruptcy and this is not the only</text>
  <text start="542.35" dur="5.94">business I mean we have many businesses</text>
  <text start="544.87" dur="5.55">right now that are slated to declare</text>
  <text start="548.29" dur="4.649">bankruptcy sometime during this year</text>
  <text start="550.42" dur="4.889">this is how bad it is we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="552.939" dur="4.14">Nine West we&amp;#39;re looking at true religion</text>
  <text start="555.309" dur="5.191">jeans we&amp;#39;re looking at charming Charlie</text>
  <text start="557.079" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re looking at Clare stores chinos and</text>
  <text start="560.5" dur="4.769">many others Sears</text>
  <text start="562.059" dur="5.431">many others that are going to declare</text>
  <text start="565.269" dur="5.641">bankruptcy they&amp;#39;re going to be closing a</text>
  <text start="567.49" dur="6.139">lot of stores and again the death the</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="5.849">birth death model will not fit into this</text>
  <text start="573.629" dur="4.841">because as these larger stores closed a</text>
  <text start="576.759" dur="5.7">lot of the small businesses are closing</text>
  <text start="578.47" dur="7.559">and they&amp;#39;re not being created and the</text>
  <text start="582.459" dur="4.481">whole thing is a complete illusion and</text>
  <text start="586.029" dur="3.371">they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="586.94" dur="4.83">using this all alone out in San</text>
  <text start="589.4" dur="4.65">Francisco what do we say well we know</text>
  <text start="591.77" dur="4.35">that the housing bubble is starting to</text>
  <text start="594.05" dur="4.86">deflate there we&amp;#39;re also seeing</text>
  <text start="596.12" dur="5.13">something very interesting hiring has</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="5.25">dropped by 4.1 percent in May</text>

  <text start="604.16" dur="7.08">the LinkedIn&amp;#39;s workforce report so when</text>
  <text start="608.51" dur="4.83">you compare this with the Employment</text>

  <text start="613.34" dur="5.61">well it shows that the growth of both</text>

  <text start="618.95" dur="3.96">San Francisco</text>
  <text start="619.82" dur="5.76">it is fizzling right now and we could</text>
  <text start="622.91" dur="3.84">see when we look at a graph of this the</text>
  <text start="625.58" dur="3.21">job growth in San Francisco</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="5.13">year-over-year you can see that it has</text>
  <text start="628.79" dur="6.3">been declining it has not been going the</text>
  <text start="631.88" dur="5.91">opposite way where it&amp;#39;s been increasing</text>
  <text start="635.09" dur="4.71">it is declining right now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="637.79" dur="6.27">hitting that point where we&amp;#39;re almost</text>
  <text start="639.8" dur="7.05">back to where we were prior to 2008 and</text>
  <text start="644.06" dur="3.42">after 2008 where everything just come to</text>
  <text start="646.85" dur="2.97">fell apart</text>
  <text start="647.48" dur="4.59">now we&amp;#39;re starting to see in many</text>
  <text start="649.82" dur="5.19">different areas things rapidly fall</text>

  <text start="878.729" dur="7.26">want to unwind their balance sheets they</text>
  <text start="882.119" dur="7.29">want to sell this now how are they going</text>
  <text start="885.989" dur="7.38">to do this without crashing the bond</text>

  <text start="898.47" dur="5.189">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="900.779" dur="6.48">stuck and the only way to get out of</text>
  <text start="903.659" dur="6.99">this is to crash the system is to bring</text>

  <text start="910.649" dur="5.04">bring the system down we can make a lot</text>
  <text start="912.419" dur="6.72">of cash on the way down we can buy up</text>
  <text start="915.689" dur="6.781">more assets and we can push the blame to</text>
  <text start="919.139" dur="5.94">someplace else this has been their plan</text>
  <text start="922.47" dur="6.479">for a very long time on the other side</text>
  <text start="925.079" dur="5.94">we have Trump using their tactics and</text>
