  <text start="84.08" dur="5.61">the central bank the feds minutes we can</text>
  <text start="87.26" dur="6.33">see that there are certain things that</text>
  <text start="89.69" dur="5.76">stand out that actually indicate that</text>
  <text start="93.59" dur="3.96">Trump and Powell are working together</text>
  <text start="95.45" dur="3.24">and we&amp;#39;re gonna get into that in just a</text>
  <text start="97.55" dur="4.83">minute but I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about Wells</text>
  <text start="98.69" dur="6.15">Fargo first here and they are reducing</text>
  <text start="102.38" dur="5.04">their staff by 10 percent we already</text>
  <text start="104.84" dur="4.17">know that they laid off about 600 or so</text>
  <text start="107.42" dur="3.69">employees from their mortgage division</text>
  <text start="109.01" dur="3.89">Wells Fargo is having a very difficult</text>
  <text start="111.11" dur="4.08">time we know the real estate market is</text>
  <text start="112.9" dur="4.9">collapsing right now mortgage</text>
  <text start="115.19" dur="4.77">applications are declining and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.8" dur="5.04">gonna see a lot of these banks start to</text>
  <text start="119.96" dur="4.17">layoff individuals that are working in</text>
  <text start="122.84" dur="3.54">the mortgage departments they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="124.13" dur="4.62">doing this for quite a while since the</text>
  <text start="126.38" dur="4.44">problems in the real estate market back</text>
  <text start="128.75" dur="4.47">in 2008 and I think this is going to</text>
  <text start="130.82" dur="5.07">continue on but Wells Fargo as we know</text>
  <text start="133.22" dur="4.95">has many other problems with employees</text>
  <text start="135.89" dur="5.58">with inside the corporation changing</text>
  <text start="138.17" dur="6.3">data on certain applications they were</text>
  <text start="141.47" dur="5.19">found out and they&amp;#39;re just having a</text>
  <text start="144.47" dur="5.13">whole lot of problems we see the US</text>
  <text start="146.66" dur="6.15">service economy it has collapsed to</text>
  <text start="149.6" dur="5.969">18-month lows and what we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="152.81" dur="5.99">here is that the service has collapsed</text>
  <text start="155.569" dur="6.301">to the lowest since March of 2017 and</text>
  <text start="158.8" dur="6.55">the composite index slipped to its</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="5.31">weakest since April 2017 and this does</text>
  <text start="165.35" dur="3.93">not look good whatsoever because we can</text>
  <text start="167.18" dur="6.42">see right now things are starting to</text>
  <text start="169.28" dur="6.57">fall apart if we go back to 2006-2007</text>
  <text start="173.6" dur="5.94">leading into 2008 we had a steady</text>
  <text start="175.85" dur="6.33">decline of the composite PMI and US GDP</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="4.41">as it declined right down into the</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="4.25">negative territory and it looks like</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="6.739">we&amp;#39;re heading in this area once again</text>
  <text start="186.43" dur="6.899">dipped way down during the election time</text>
  <text start="190.689" dur="4.981">in 2016 and then of course what happened</text>
  <text start="193.329" dur="4.11">was Trump came in the economy was</text>
  <text start="195.67" dur="3.03">boosted up for a while he started</text>
  <text start="197.439" dur="3.151">manipulating all the numbers just like</text>
  <text start="198.7" dur="5.399">Obama was doing but took it to the nth</text>
  <text start="200.59" dur="5.28">degree and this is all now running out</text>
  <text start="204.099" dur="3.81">because what happens is you can</text>
  <text start="205.87" dur="4.47">manipulate as far as you possibly can</text>
  <text start="207.909" dur="4.17">you can make people feel good you can</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="3.509">make it look good but eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.079" dur="3.901">going to happen is the real economy is</text>
  <text start="213.849" dur="4.17">going to show its ugly face and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="215.98" dur="4.399">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now in the real</text>
  <text start="218.019" dur="5.25">estate market but Trump knows this and</text>
  <text start="220.379" dur="5.53">the people behind him know this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.269" dur="5.431">doing this on purpose they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="225.909" dur="5.61">this economy and using the weapons of</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="5.459">the central bank the deep state this way</text>
  <text start="231.519" dur="4.53">they can&amp;#39;t say anything against what</text>
  <text start="234.159" dur="3.871">he&amp;#39;s doing because he&amp;#39;s using their</text>
  <text start="236.049" dur="4.14">tools but if we look at the real estate</text>
  <text start="238.03" dur="4.739">market let&amp;#39;s say New York City and we</text>
  <text start="240.189" dur="5.7">look at the home sellers in at New York</text>
  <text start="242.769" dur="6.481">City they have slashed prices on almost</text>
  <text start="245.889" dur="5.94">800 listings during a single week this</text>
  <text start="249.25" dur="7.019">month this is the largest wave of</text>
  <text start="251.829" dur="6.33">discounts in at least 12 years so in the</text>
  <text start="256.269" dur="5.34">week through September 9th</text>
  <text start="258.159" dur="6.471">there was 774 homes in manhattan</text>
  <text start="261.609" dur="6.81">brooklyn and queens that got a price cut</text>
  <text start="264.63" dur="6.039">the most for any seven-day period and</text>
  <text start="268.419" dur="4.321">data going back to 2006 according to</text>
  <text start="270.669" dur="5.041">report friday by listing website street</text>
  <text start="272.74" dur="5.97">easy the previous weekly record was in</text>
  <text start="275.71" dur="6.209">march of 2009 during the global</text>
  <text start="278.71" dur="7.47">recession when 713 properties were</text>
  <text start="281.919" dur="6.691">reduced so we can see that we are doing</text>
  <text start="286.18" dur="6.209">the same exact thing that happened in</text>
  <text start="288.61" dur="5.61">2008 nothing&amp;#39;s really changed here all</text>
  <text start="292.389" dur="4.71">they did was manipulate pump up the</text>
  <text start="294.22" dur="4.83">bubbles and made the economy look really</text>
  <text start="297.099" dur="4.41">great it&amp;#39;s an illusion it was an</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="5.7">illusion back in 2008 that&amp;#39;s why it fell</text>
  <text start="301.509" dur="6.061">apart and as we pointed out earlier this</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="5.52">year sales of luxury apartments those</text>
  <text start="307.57" dur="4.92">that cost 5 million or more plummeted</text>
  <text start="310.27" dur="3.149">more than 31 percent over the first six</text>
  <text start="312.49" dur="3.51">months of this year</text>
  <text start="313.419" dur="6.18">forcing sellers to slash their prices I</text>
  <text start="316" dur="4.23">wonder if that&amp;#39;s why notion is selling</text>
  <text start="319.599" dur="4.351">his</text>
  <text start="320.23" dur="6.78">luxury apartment in New York getting</text>
  <text start="323.95" dur="5.7">trying to get top dollar because he</text>
  <text start="327.01" dur="6.15">knows we&amp;#39;re at the top of the market and</text>
  <text start="329.65" dur="6.06">the market is coming down the insiders</text>
  <text start="333.16" dur="6.72">know what&amp;#39;s going on they understand</text>
  <text start="335.71" dur="7.35">what&amp;#39;s going on and we have to realize</text>
  <text start="339.88" dur="7.08">that all of this is part of a bigger</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="5.64">plan the insiders realize that this</text>
  <text start="346.96" dur="5.13">economy is completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="348.7" dur="5.88">false that the central bank prior to</text>
  <text start="352.09" dur="3.96">Trump has been pumping and creating this</text>
  <text start="354.58" dur="3.18">illusion to make us think that the</text>
  <text start="356.05" dur="2.88">economy is great and what they were</text>
  <text start="357.76" dur="3.74">going to do is they were going to crash</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="6.12">it and they were going to blame this on</text>
  <text start="361.5" dur="5.86">at that time most likely a war then they</text>
  <text start="365.05" dur="3.24">tried to switch it to Trump but the</text>
  <text start="367.36" dur="3.78">tables have turned</text>
  <text start="368.29" dur="5.1">Trump has taken control of the economy</text>
  <text start="371.14" dur="4.14">he has the magic wand he can make the</text>
  <text start="373.39" dur="4.38">economy look any way he wants he can</text>
  <text start="375.28" dur="4.5">pump these numbers up any way he wants</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="4.2">and make it look fantastic I mean</text>
  <text start="379.78" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s been a shift in GDP by like a</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="4.65">trillion dollars I mean when Obama was</text>
  <text start="385.06" dur="4.53">president he went all the way back to</text>
  <text start="386.62" dur="5.46">1929 added in research and development</text>
  <text start="389.59" dur="5.13">into the GDP numbers recalculated it all</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="4.86">the way to the present day so basically</text>
  <text start="394.72" dur="4.65">what Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s using Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="5.31">magic wand and doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="399.37" dur="5.01">thing this way nobody can blame him for</text>
  <text start="402.25" dur="4.2">the economy falling apart with all these</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="4.56">tariffs and all these things that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.45" dur="4.71">doing right now in negotiating the trade</text>
  <text start="408.94" dur="4.71">deals they can&amp;#39;t say oh it was because</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="2.97">of that so they&amp;#39;re kind of stuck right</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="3">now</text>
  <text start="414.13" dur="5.22">and I think they were depending on the</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="4.38">central bank to actually try to bring</text>
  <text start="419.35" dur="4.59">the economy down and blame it on Trump</text>
  <text start="421.03" dur="4.74">but I think Trump has taken control over</text>
  <text start="423.94" dur="4.52">the central bank and the reason why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="6.8">saying this is because of what is in the</text>
  <text start="428.46" dur="7.51">feds minutes now let&amp;#39;s go over this</text>
  <text start="432.57" dur="6.13">Trump when he first brought in Powell he</text>
  <text start="435.97" dur="5.76">thought he was going to be an easy money</text>
  <text start="438.7" dur="6.06">type of Fed he didn&amp;#39;t know he was going</text>
  <text start="441.73" dur="5.88">to be in an interest rate Fed now of</text>
  <text start="444.76" dur="5.91">course Trump no exactly knows exactly</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="5.09">what Powell was going to do and this is</text>
  <text start="450.67" dur="3.48">why he put this message out there</text>
  <text start="452.7" dur="4.21">contradicting</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="4.32">fed going I mean think about what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.91" dur="3.69">doing with sessions think think what he</text>
  <text start="458.47" dur="4.14">does with North Korea think what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.6" dur="4.53">doing with Iran he&amp;#39;s always saying well</text>
  <text start="462.61" dur="5.61">I didn&amp;#39;t realize that this person was</text>
  <text start="465.13" dur="5.16">gonna be this way too bad so sad and</text>
  <text start="468.22" dur="3.65">he&amp;#39;s doing with Powell right now and</text>
  <text start="470.29" dur="6.96">that&amp;#39;s what those tweets were about</text>
  <text start="471.87" dur="9.61">because Powell has set one goal and one</text>
  <text start="477.25" dur="8.01">goal only for his policy hitting the</text>
  <text start="481.48" dur="5.58">neutral rate of interest the neutral</text>
  <text start="485.26" dur="5.07">rate of interest is when the Fed has</text>
  <text start="487.06" dur="5.46">rates equal to the pace of inflation now</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="3.51">while this is technically what the Fed</text>
  <text start="492.52" dur="4.23">is supposed to be doing</text>
  <text start="493.84" dur="6.77">no Fed or any other central bank for</text>
  <text start="496.75" dur="7.5">that matter has done it in over 30 years</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="5.52">Greenspan Bernanke Yellen all these feds</text>
  <text start="504.25" dur="4.23">were all notorious for running</text>
  <text start="506.13" dur="4.09">accommodative policies in which rates</text>
  <text start="508.48" dur="4.89">were kept well below the rate of</text>
  <text start="510.22" dur="4.53">inflation during the July</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="4.35">question-and-answer session with</text>
  <text start="514.75" dur="5.61">Congress in July fed sure Powell</text>
  <text start="517.72" dur="5.16">emphasized that the most important focus</text>
  <text start="520.36" dur="5.82">for the Fed under his leadership would</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="5.49">be a neutral rate of interest the Fed</text>
  <text start="526.18" dur="7.26">will be hiking rates until it reaches</text>
  <text start="528.37" dur="7.83">that point now doing this would create a</text>
  <text start="533.44" dur="5.61">serious issue for the financial markets</text>
  <text start="536.2" dur="3.47">I mean let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="539.05" dur="3.57">second</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="4.84">already globally numerous markets</text>
  <text start="542.62" dur="5.1">ranging from China to Germany have</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="5.37">entered Corrections if not outright bear</text>
  <text start="547.72" dur="5.19">markets as a result of the feds hawkish</text>
  <text start="549.88" dur="5.46">Ness eventually this means it is all</text>
  <text start="552.91" dur="4.44">going to spill into the US markets when</text>
  <text start="555.34" dur="4.74">it does the bursting of the everything</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="5.67">bubble will have officially hit the US</text>
  <text start="560.08" dur="5.07">shores and we know if he&amp;#39;s going to try</text>
  <text start="563.02" dur="3.9">to raise the rates to a certain point</text>
  <text start="565.15" dur="4.59">and we know that point is around two</text>
  <text start="566.92" dur="5.52">point nine three percent that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="569.74" dur="5.58">start a domino effect it has already</text>
  <text start="572.44" dur="6.33">started a domino effect so what we know</text>
  <text start="575.32" dur="7.53">right now is that PAML has a mission and</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="7.95">this mission is to continually raise the</text>
  <text start="582.85" dur="5.4">rates until the entire system implode</text>
  <text start="586.72" dur="4.71">this way this</text>
  <text start="588.25" dur="6.57">central bank will be blamed for the</text>
  <text start="591.43" dur="6.27">economy crashing now it the economy</text>
  <text start="594.82" dur="5.88">might crash before this time with bad</text>
  <text start="597.7" dur="5.07">news coming out hopefully with the magic</text>
  <text start="600.7" dur="4.8">wand of Trump he can continually</text>
  <text start="602.77" dur="5.13">manipulate it so everything doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="605.5" dur="5.94">crash because I think what their real</text>
  <text start="607.9" dur="6.45">plan is is to have the entire system to</text>
  <text start="611.44" dur="5.97">be blamed on the central bank to take</text>
  <text start="614.35" dur="5.61">control of the central bank so from</text>
  <text start="617.41" dur="6.36">these minutes from what Powell has been</text>
  <text start="619.96" dur="6.96">saying is exactly the way to bring down</text>
  <text start="623.77" dur="6.96">the system just look back in time go</text>
  <text start="626.92" dur="6.21">back to 2006-2007 watch the interest</text>
  <text start="630.73" dur="4.29">rates the Fed increase the interest</text>
  <text start="633.13" dur="4.2">rates to a certain point when it hit a</text>
  <text start="635.02" dur="4.65">certain point the economy started to</text>
  <text start="637.33" dur="4.53">fall apart and then all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="639.67" dur="6.21">dropped it really really fast they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="641.86" dur="6.75">doing the same trick and the Fed knows</text>
  <text start="645.88" dur="4.98">what this will do to the economy Trump</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="4.86">knows what this will do the economy so</text>
  <text start="650.86" dur="5.37">let&amp;#39;s look at this plan here pump the</text>
  <text start="653.47" dur="7.13">economy up manipulate the numbers make</text>
  <text start="656.23" dur="7.2">it look fantastic have Powell our guy</text>
  <text start="660.6" dur="6.61">raise the rates and continually raise</text>
  <text start="663.43" dur="7.71">the rates until the economy starts to</text>
  <text start="667.21" dur="7.02">fall apart have the economy fall apart</text>
  <text start="671.14" dur="5.79">Trump&amp;#39;s hands are clean he built the</text>
  <text start="674.23" dur="6.66">economy up the central bank brought it</text>
  <text start="676.93" dur="4.29">down point the finger at the central</text>
  <text start="680.89" dur="2.52">bank</text>
  <text start="681.22" dur="4.29">we need to audit it we need to figure</text>
  <text start="683.41" dur="5.22">out what happened here we need to take</text>
  <text start="685.51" dur="5.07">control of it and this is the plan they</text>
  <text start="688.63" dur="4.95">are using think about it with sessions</text>
