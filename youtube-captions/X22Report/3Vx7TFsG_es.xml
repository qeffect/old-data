  <text start="114.08" dur="4.649">preparing for this and I do believe</text>
  <text start="116.72" dur="4.259">what&amp;#39;s going to happen eventually is</text>
  <text start="118.729" dur="5.28">that the north and the south they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120.979" dur="5.131">going to be unified the border wall is</text>
  <text start="124.009" dur="4.771">going to be taking down the one belt one</text>
  <text start="126.11" dur="4.289">road is going to be built we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="128.78" dur="3.81">see commerce with China</text>
  <text start="130.399" dur="5.071">we&amp;#39;re gonna see commerce with Russia and</text>
  <text start="132.59" dur="3.9">all of this is being done for a specific</text>
  <text start="135.47" dur="4.08">reason</text>
  <text start="136.49" dur="4.02">the entire economic system is breaking</text>
  <text start="139.55" dur="4.56">down right now</text>
  <text start="140.51" dur="5.79">the dollar is dying the new system which</text>
  <text start="144.11" dur="3.48">is most likely going to be China because</text>
  <text start="146.3" dur="3.54">they have all the manufacturing they</text>
  <text start="147.59" dur="5.16">duplicated everything here that we have</text>
  <text start="149.84" dur="4.71">in the West they have gold they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="152.75" dur="3.6">purchasing a lot of gold Russia has been</text>
  <text start="154.55" dur="4.44">person purchasing a lot of gold they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="156.35" dur="5.52">been moving away from the dollar trading</text>
  <text start="158.99" dur="5.91">with other countries not in the dollar</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;ve been making bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="164.9" dur="3.89">agreements with many many different</text>
  <text start="166.67" dur="4.289">countries and we can see this is ongoing</text>
  <text start="168.79" dur="4.84">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this for</text>
  <text start="170.959" dur="5.161">quite a while the only question is will</text>
  <text start="173.63" dur="5.91">the central bankers control all of this</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="5.1">or will they break free from the central</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="4.41">banking system and I do believe in the</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="5.19">end that is the plan to break free from</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="3.06">the central banking system because as we</text>
  <text start="186.41" dur="2.01">know Trump</text>
  <text start="187.01" dur="3.3">as Andrew Jackson hanging on his wall</text>
  <text start="188.42" dur="4.17">and yes I&amp;#39;ve said that many many times</text>
  <text start="190.31" dur="4.319">the reason why he has this I think this</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="4.039">is the ultimate plan is to get rid of</text>
  <text start="194.629" dur="5.371">the central banking system there is no</text>
  <text start="196.629" dur="7.78">need for it there is no reason for it</text>
  <text start="200" dur="7.829">they do not help the system they destroy</text>
  <text start="204.409" dur="6.031">the system to benefit themselves now we</text>
  <text start="207.829" dur="5.16">see a lot of countries where they are</text>
  <text start="210.44" dur="5.85">purchasing hardware and I should say</text>
  <text start="212.989" dur="5.911">military assets from Russia and I think</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="4.41">this is being done on purpose I mean we</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="4.19">see India right now we&amp;#39;ve also seen many</text>
  <text start="220.7" dur="4.86">other countries purchasing the s400</text>
  <text start="223.09" dur="4.269">anti-missile defense system and I</text>
  <text start="225.56" dur="5.039">believe once these countries start to</text>
  <text start="227.359" dur="7.05">break away and not use the dollar they</text>
  <text start="230.599" dur="6.121">want to protect themselves from the deep</text>
  <text start="234.409" dur="5.58">state now remember the deep state still</text>
  <text start="236.72" dur="5.879">has power the deep state still has the</text>
  <text start="239.989" dur="4.711">ability to have events the deep state</text>
  <text start="242.599" dur="5.101">still controls the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="4.289">they want full control they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="2.909">to give up control and they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="248.989" dur="4.051">to give up control that easily they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="250.609" dur="4.081">gonna fight to the very very end but we</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="5.189">see there are many countries out there</text>
  <text start="254.69" dur="6.299">India Turkey Egypt and many others that</text>
  <text start="258.229" dur="5.641">have been purchasing weapons from Russia</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="6.391">plus they&amp;#39;ve seen how weapon Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.87" dur="4.799">weapons shared with Syria and many of</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="3.96">the countries are looking at this saying</text>
  <text start="268.669" dur="4.891">hey they&amp;#39;re pretty good let me get some</text>
  <text start="271.34" dur="6.59">of this and we see already that Turkey</text>
  <text start="273.56" dur="7.169">they might purchase the russian sukhoi</text>
  <text start="277.93" dur="5.23">su-7 fifth-generation fighter they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.729" dur="6.321">supposed to have a deal with the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="283.16" dur="7.59">purchase the f-35 fighter but once again</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="5.35">Turkey is pivoting away from the US</text>
  <text start="290.75" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re looking and they purchased the</text>
  <text start="292.4" dur="5.25">SU 300 it looks like they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="4.679">purchase the Russian fighter and we see</text>
  <text start="297.65" dur="4.62">a lot of countries they will be pivoting</text>
  <text start="299.449" dur="6.09">away from the US from the dying dollar</text>
  <text start="302.27" dur="6.03">this is the endgame that we&amp;#39;ve seen in</text>
  <text start="305.539" dur="5.431">the past where countries move away they</text>
  <text start="308.3" dur="4.29">do a balancing act between the dollar</text>
  <text start="310.97" dur="3.27">and whatever currency they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="312.59" dur="4.079">use or whatever country they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="314.24" dur="4.649">work with and the US and they slowly</text>
  <text start="316.669" dur="3.751">move away from the US because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.889" dur="3.421">protecting themselves and</text>
  <text start="320.42" dur="4.8">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we see</text>
  <text start="322.31" dur="4.91">out in Syria the Syrian state-run media</text>
  <text start="325.22" dur="4.98">they are accusing the u.s. Intel</text>
  <text start="327.22" dur="5.05">intelligence agencies of staging fake</text>
  <text start="330.2" dur="4.14">chemical attacks and we know this</text>
  <text start="332.27" dur="4.2">already we know the white helmets we</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="4.65">know the terrorist groups they all been</text>
  <text start="336.47" dur="4.53">staging these chemical attacks and</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re saying that the US intelligence</text>
  <text start="341" dur="4.41">services they&amp;#39;re continuing to organize</text>
  <text start="343.4" dur="3.84">staged operations with chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="345.41" dur="4.41">against Syrians and they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="4.29">about the United Kingdom they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="349.82" dur="4.56">about France they&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="351.53" dur="5.49">United States and they have evidence</text>
  <text start="354.38" dur="4.41">right now of the intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="4.02">staging everything actually there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.79" dur="5.67">there they&amp;#39;re photographing they have</text>
  <text start="361.04" dur="6.21">the evidence of where they are staging</text>
  <text start="364.46" dur="4.26">all this Russia when the chemical the</text>
  <text start="367.25" dur="4.32">false flag chemical attacks took place</text>
  <text start="368.72" dur="5.31">they also warned everyone that these</text>
  <text start="371.57" dur="5.52">were being staged and we&amp;#39;ve known this</text>
  <text start="374.03" dur="5.67">for a very long time that these chemical</text>
  <text start="377.09" dur="5.28">weapons attacks they were complete fake</text>
  <text start="379.7" dur="4.71">phony and false there were that there</text>
  <text start="382.37" dur="4.29">were some that were real but it was the</text>
  <text start="384.41" dur="4.56">terrorists that were using the sarin gas</text>
  <text start="386.66" dur="4.8">it was the terrorists that we that was</text>
  <text start="388.97" dur="5.43">used in the chlorine gas and most of the</text>
  <text start="391.46" dur="5.28">time the OPCW never inspected these</text>
  <text start="394.4" dur="5.52">areas because these attacks took place</text>
  <text start="396.74" dur="5.31">in the terrorists areas and they</text>
  <text start="399.92" dur="5.4">couldn&amp;#39;t get access the latest attack</text>
  <text start="402.05" dur="4.86">took place in a Syrian Russian</text>
  <text start="405.32" dur="3.86">controlled area that was the big</text>
  <text start="406.91" dur="5.39">difference this time where Russia</text>
  <text start="409.18" dur="6.1">basically took that whole entire area</text>
  <text start="412.3" dur="4.65">protected it to make sure the OPCW can</text>
  <text start="415.28" dur="4.29">come in there and they even allowed</text>
  <text start="416.95" dur="4.33">reporters to come into this area to</text>
  <text start="419.57" dur="4.32">inspect and most of the reporters there</text>
  <text start="421.28" dur="4.59">I would say almost all of them said they</text>
  <text start="423.89" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t see any signs of any chemical</text>
  <text start="425.87" dur="4.86">attack they spoke to many people around</text>
  <text start="427.64" dur="5.27">the area and that whole narrative that</text>
  <text start="430.73" dur="5.28">was put forth by the deep state</text>
  <text start="432.91" dur="5.59">completely fell apart and that was the</text>
  <text start="436.01" dur="5.67">big difference this time that this took</text>
  <text start="438.5" dur="6.51">place in a Russian Syrian controlled</text>
  <text start="441.68" dur="5.1">area and we see right now that the deep</text>
  <text start="445.01" dur="4.32">State the intelligence operatives</text>
  <text start="446.78" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re not going to stop remember they</text>
  <text start="449.33" dur="4.98">never stop they always continually push</text>
  <text start="452.06" dur="6.06">their goal to the very very end</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="6.24">we see right now Syria Russia they want</text>
  <text start="458.12" dur="5.19">the foreign troops out of Syria and the</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="5.58">Syrian army they are now pushing the</text>
  <text start="463.31" dur="6.3">Turkish troops out of Latakia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.13" dur="6.75">pushing them north back into Turkey and</text>
  <text start="469.61" dur="6.39">it started out as shells being fired</text>
  <text start="472.88" dur="5.07">back and forth and this escalated and</text>
  <text start="476" dur="4.71">now it looks like the Syrian army is now</text>
  <text start="477.95" dur="5.31">pushing Turkey out of their country we</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="4.32">see us Jordan they agreed to hold</text>
  <text start="483.26" dur="4.71">meetings with Russia on the stirrin</text>
  <text start="485.03" dur="4.77">southern zone of the escalation remember</text>
  <text start="487.97" dur="4.26">Lavrov came out and said listen we</text>
  <text start="489.8" dur="4.47">agreed to set up this de-escalation zone</text>
  <text start="492.23" dur="3.54">in the southern part of Syria because</text>
  <text start="494.27" dur="3.93">eventually what was going to happen is</text>
  <text start="495.77" dur="6.09">the foreign troops were going to leave</text>
  <text start="498.2" dur="7.2">Syria and yes this is still on schedule</text>
  <text start="501.86" dur="5.64">the troops will be leaving Syria now</text>
  <text start="505.4" dur="5.16">this is the plan can anything else</text>
  <text start="507.5" dur="5.31">happen of course plans always change but</text>
  <text start="510.56" dur="4.05">this is the plan and it seems like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.81" dur="3.9">moving forward and this is why Putin</text>
  <text start="514.61" dur="5.25">came out and said all foreign troops</text>
  <text start="516.71" dur="6.09">must leave including Iran and of course</text>
  <text start="519.86" dur="6.21">this is the last part piece of the</text>
  <text start="522.8" dur="5.34">puzzle of why the deep state is staying</text>
  <text start="526.07" dur="4.62">in there because they&amp;#39;re saying Iran is</text>
  <text start="528.14" dur="4.41">in there if you remove Iran guess what</text>
  <text start="530.69" dur="3.45">there is no reason for the troops to</text>
  <text start="532.55" dur="2.91">stay in there and this is what the deep</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="4.98">State has been using for a very long</text>
  <text start="535.46" dur="6">time if we go back to 2013 2014 when we</text>
  <text start="539.12" dur="4.5">had the chemical weapons attack in Syria</text>
  <text start="541.46" dur="4.77">and Putin came out and said listen</text>
  <text start="543.62" dur="3.81">instead of invading because remember the</text>
  <text start="546.23" dur="3.42">fleet was there in the Mediterranean</text>
  <text start="547.43" dur="4.97">they were ready to go in there to bomb</text>
  <text start="549.65" dur="6.03">Obama said they crossed a red line and</text>
  <text start="552.4" dur="5.56">Putin came out and said listen if Assad</text>
  <text start="555.68" dur="5.4">gets rid of the chemical weapons will</text>
  <text start="557.96" dur="6.21">you be okay with this now basically what</text>
  <text start="561.08" dur="4.59">was happening at that time is the u.s.</text>
  <text start="564.17" dur="4.35">the deep state they were losing traction</text>
  <text start="565.67" dur="4.61">on the story they were losing the</text>
  <text start="568.52" dur="4.68">narrative of the story because</text>
  <text start="570.28" dur="7.24">investigations have found out that the</text>
  <text start="573.2" dur="6.66">shells were fired from the rebel area</text>
  <text start="577.52" dur="6.96">the moderate rebels it was not fired</text>
  <text start="579.86" dur="5.82">from the Assad controlled areas and the</text>
  <text start="584.48" dur="3.53">story started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="585.68" dur="6.58">so they went along with Putin&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="588.01" dur="7.59">plan and basically he stopped the entire</text>
  <text start="592.26" dur="4.81">US force from going into Syria but again</text>
  <text start="595.6" dur="3.54">this didn&amp;#39;t stop the deep state</text>
  <text start="597.07" dur="5.25">they just regrouped and tried again and</text>
  <text start="599.14" dur="6.45">eventually with Obama in office they did</text>
  <text start="602.32" dur="6.18">get US troops in Syria they were able to</text>
  <text start="605.59" dur="5.01">fly missions in Syria bombing and</text>
  <text start="608.5" dur="3.96">allowing the Islamic state to gain</text>
  <text start="610.6" dur="4.2">additional ground all they did was</text>
  <text start="612.46" dur="6.21">create another terrorist group having</text>
  <text start="614.8" dur="6.09">flood into Iraq then into Syria and we</text>
  <text start="618.67" dur="5.43">see right now that everything has</text>
  <text start="620.89" dur="5.97">completely changed the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="624.1" dur="5.7">beaten al Qaeda pretty much gone</text>
  <text start="626.86" dur="5.64">al-nusra pretty much gone the moderate</text>
  <text start="629.8" dur="5.34">rebels being bused out of the country</text>
  <text start="632.5" dur="5.91">and we see that the Syrian armed forces</text>
  <text start="635.14" dur="7.47">are ready to mount a major offensive in</text>
  <text start="638.41" dur="8.07">the southern part of Syria and we this</text>
  <text start="642.61" dur="5.91">is in the provinces of Daraa and we</text>
  <text start="646.48" dur="4.29">could see Israel is on the opposite side</text>
  <text start="648.52" dur="4.71">where they&amp;#39;re ready to counter these</text>
  <text start="650.77" dur="3.9">offensives and what is happening right</text>
  <text start="653.23" dur="4.77">now is that the Syrian government</text>
  <text start="654.67" dur="6.57">doesn&amp;#39;t care about anything except</text>
  <text start="658" dur="5.97">taking back their country and it was</text>
  <text start="661.24" dur="4.92">taken from them and they want it back</text>
  <text start="663.97" dur="4.5">just like the northern part turkey took</text>
  <text start="666.16" dur="4.2">part of it the southern part Israel took</text>
  <text start="668.47" dur="4.26">part of it and now they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="670.36" dur="6.3">fight to take it back and we can see</text>
  <text start="672.73" dur="7.5">that they will take back their land and</text>
  <text start="676.66" dur="8.25">we see Russia is assisting we see the</text>
  <text start="680.23" dur="8.58">drive to push all foreign troops back as</text>
  <text start="684.91" dur="6.57">far as possible and to place Syrian</text>
  <text start="688.81" dur="5.46">troops at the border we saw already with</text>
  <text start="691.48" dur="4.76">Iraq and Syria they are protecting the</text>
  <text start="694.27" dur="4.26">borders this is going to happen around</text>
  <text start="696.24" dur="4.63">Syria and they&amp;#39;re going to protect the</text>
  <text start="698.53" dur="4.71">borders what was planned before by the</text>
  <text start="700.87" dur="4.44">deep state is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="703.24" dur="3.87">where they were going to separate Syria</text>
  <text start="705.31" dur="3.9">where they were going to have a Kurd</text>
  <text start="707.11" dur="4.38">region that are going to have the Shiar</text>
  <text start="709.21" dur="5.04">region they&amp;#39;re gonna have a Sunni region</text>
  <text start="711.49" dur="4.74">that is not happening we see already</text>
  <text start="714.25" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s a political process happening</text>
  <text start="716.23" dur="4.59">right now we already see the first stage</text>
  <text start="718.57" dur="2.79">of getting a ran out of the country than</text>
  <text start="720.82" dur="3.959">having the</text>
  <text start="721.36" dur="6">coalition forces removed from this area</text>
  <text start="724.779" dur="5.101">that is the plan now does this mean that</text>
  <text start="727.36" dur="3.81">the coalition forces and the other deep</text>
  <text start="729.88" dur="2.85">state factions are gonna go along with</text>
  <text start="731.17" dur="4.02">this no they&amp;#39;re gonna fight it of course</text>
  <text start="732.73" dur="5.22">they are but the plan is to push all of</text>
  <text start="735.19" dur="5.07">these out of the country and then have</text>
  <text start="737.95" dur="5.759">the troops come home this is the endgame</text>
  <text start="740.26" dur="4.86">that they&amp;#39;re trying to hit and it looks</text>
  <text start="743.709" dur="3.031">like it&amp;#39;s on schedule</text>
  <text start="745.12" dur="3.6">but again the deep state could do</text>
  <text start="746.74" dur="2.82">anything to stop this we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="748.72" dur="3.6">before</text>
  <text start="749.56" dur="5.07">remember these state they want control</text>
  <text start="752.32" dur="4.25">over everything they&amp;#39;ve controlled the</text>
  <text start="754.63" dur="4.47">corporate media they&amp;#39;ve controlled</text>
  <text start="756.57" dur="4.42">Facebook they controlled YouTube they</text>
  <text start="759.1" dur="4.049">control you know all these different</text>
  <text start="760.99" dur="5.13">platforms yes it&amp;#39;s a little difficult to</text>
  <text start="763.149" dur="5.43">shut things down completely because we</text>
  <text start="766.12" dur="4.11">still have the Constitution we still</text>
  <text start="768.579" dur="4.44">have the Bill of Rights but if you</text>
  <text start="770.23" dur="4.38">notice and on YouTube and on Google and</text>
  <text start="773.019" dur="3">on Facebook they keep changing the rules</text>
  <text start="774.61" dur="3.39">they keep changing the Terms of Service</text>
  <text start="776.019" dur="5.13">because they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a</text>
  <text start="778" dur="5.339">way how to shut down everyone that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="781.149" dur="4.62">speaking out they&amp;#39;re arresting people</text>
  <text start="783.339" dur="4.321">now just like Tommy Robinson in the UK</text>
  <text start="785.769" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="787.66" dur="4.59">to shut down anyone that speaks out and</text>
  <text start="790.269" dur="4.141">if you go back in time this has been</text>
  <text start="792.25" dur="3.99">tried before I mean they just burn books</text>
  <text start="794.41" dur="3.21">they said listen we don&amp;#39;t want you to</text>
  <text start="796.24" dur="4.349">see this so we&amp;#39;re just gonna burn it</text>
  <text start="797.62" dur="5.969">but people always find a way around this</text>
  <text start="800.589" dur="4.711">and again this is all about control who</text>
  <text start="803.589" dur="3.841">is gonna control the narrative who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="805.3" dur="5.219">gonna control what is being said out</text>
  <text start="807.43" dur="5.73">there and again we have voices coming</text>
  <text start="810.519" dur="5.041">out from all different areas countering</text>
  <text start="813.16" dur="3.869">what the corporate media is saying</text>
  <text start="815.56" dur="3.48">countering what the intelligence</text>
  <text start="817.029" dur="4.74">agencies are saying countering what the</text>
  <text start="819.04" dur="4.77">deep state is saying and they always try</text>
  <text start="821.769" dur="3.81">to fight back and this is why they came</text>
  <text start="823.81" dur="3.899">out with fake news and this is why it</text>
  <text start="825.579" dur="4.411">was kind of turned around on them where</text>
  <text start="827.709" dur="3.781">they tried to use it to say oh all those</text>
  <text start="829.99" dur="3.05">alternative media stations they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="831.49" dur="3.539">completely fake phony and false and</text>
  <text start="833.04" dur="3.64">we&amp;#39;re gonna you know put up fact</text>
  <text start="835.029" dur="3.631">checkers and all these other things but</text>
  <text start="836.68" dur="4.38">that kind of failed the people will</text>
  <text start="838.66" dur="3.72">decide what is true and what is not if</text>
  <text start="841.06" dur="3.3">you don&amp;#39;t believe something&amp;#39;s true don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="842.38" dur="4.11">listen if you believe it&amp;#39;s true then</text>
  <text start="844.36" dur="3.539">listen do some research and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="846.49" dur="3.93">gonna have their own opinions that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="847.899" dur="4.56">great that&amp;#39;s making you think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="850.42" dur="4.22">making you say well wait a minute why is</text>
  <text start="852.459" dur="4.611">this true that why isn&amp;#39;t that true</text>
  <text start="854.64" dur="4.62">everyone should be doing this and we see</text>
  <text start="857.07" dur="4.65">right now the name of the game is</text>
  <text start="859.26" dur="5.13">control and this is what the deep state</text>
  <text start="861.72" dur="5.1">has wanted from the very beginning this</text>
  <text start="864.39" dur="4.23">is what the central bankers wanted from</text>
  <text start="866.82" dur="3.99">the very beginning and if you really</text>
  <text start="868.62" dur="4.32">think about it they wanted a one-world</text>
  <text start="870.81" dur="4.47">government they wanted a one currency</text>
  <text start="872.94" dur="5.16">that was centralized that they</text>
  <text start="875.28" dur="5.61">controlled so they can control the world</text>
  <text start="878.1" dur="5.37">that was their endgame here and right</text>
  <text start="880.89" dur="4.86">now with having all these different</text>
  <text start="883.47" dur="5.13">countries their system is decentralized</text>
  <text start="885.75" dur="5.25">they don&amp;#39;t like this and countries will</text>
  <text start="888.6" dur="4.56">eventually break away from their system</text>
  <text start="891" dur="4.62">there are some countries that want to</text>
  <text start="893.16" dur="5.03">break away and have broken away and</text>
  <text start="895.62" dur="4.83">there are using different currencies and</text>
  <text start="898.19" dur="4.87">bypassing the dollar that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="900.45" dur="4.95">decentralized system having all these</text>
  <text start="903.06" dur="4.77">countries out there is a decentralized</text>
  <text start="905.4" dur="4.59">system they don&amp;#39;t like it because each</text>
  <text start="907.83" dur="4.14">country can decide on their own what</text>
  <text start="909.99" dur="4.1">they want to do this is why they created</text>
  <text start="911.97" dur="5.54">the Euro because they wanted a</text>
  <text start="914.09" dur="5.77">centralized Europe and Europe right now</text>
  <text start="917.51" dur="4.36">doesn&amp;#39;t want to be centralized they want</text>
  <text start="919.86" dur="3.96">to be decentralized and this is why we</text>
  <text start="921.87" dur="3.87">had the brexit in the UK and of course</text>
  <text start="923.82" dur="5.76">Soros and the rest they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="925.74" dur="7.02">have a revote of this brexit because</text>
  <text start="929.58" dur="5.43">they don&amp;#39;t want the UK voting themselves</text>
  <text start="932.76" dur="4.32">away they don&amp;#39;t want a decentralized</text>
  <text start="935.01" dur="4.59">system and that&amp;#39;s the important part</text>
  <text start="937.08" dur="5.1">about this is a decentralized system</text>
  <text start="939.6" dur="5.13">makes it very hard for the central</text>
  <text start="942.18" dur="4.83">bankers to maintain control because to</text>
  <text start="944.73" dur="5.07">maintain control over all of it you need</text>
  <text start="947.01" dur="5.52">to centralize everything and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="949.8" dur="5.4">main objective here is to decentralize</text>
  <text start="952.53" dur="5.04">everything decentralize countries there</text>
  <text start="955.2" dur="2.82">should be each each country should be on</text>
  <text start="957.57" dur="1.98">their own</text>
  <text start="958.02" dur="4.35">there shouldn&amp;#39;t be a centralized</text>
  <text start="959.55" dur="4.77">currency that they use they should be</text>
  <text start="962.37" dur="4.19">their own currency because this will</text>
  <text start="964.32" dur="4.47">make it harder for the central bank</text>
  <text start="966.56" dur="4.63">establishment this will make it harder</text>
  <text start="968.79" dur="4.77">for them to operate once they start to</text>
  <text start="971.19" dur="4.11">centralize things that makes it easier</text>
  <text start="973.56" dur="4.11">for them and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="975.3" dur="4.95">the past now it&amp;#39;s time to go the</text>
  <text start="977.67" dur="5.67">opposite way it&amp;#39;s time to decentralize</text>
  <text start="980.25" dur="6.12">to make them lose control and we the</text>
  <text start="983.34" dur="5.25">people gain control back and they tried</text>
  <text start="986.37" dur="3.63">to basically central</text>
  <text start="988.59" dur="3.09">is everything with refugees going into</text>
  <text start="990" dur="3.87">all these different countries trying to</text>
  <text start="991.68" dur="4.23">blend everything and the countries</text>
  <text start="993.87" dur="4.32">fought back they didn&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="995.91" dur="3.42">happen because they didn&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="998.19" dur="3.48">blended they didn&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="999.33" dur="4.2">centralized and that&amp;#39;s what the central</text>
  <text start="1001.67" dur="3.15">bank that&amp;#39;s what the deep state that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1003.53" dur="3.27">what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do for a</text>
  <text start="1004.82" dur="4.41">very long time they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="1006.8" dur="5.22">centralize everything even regime change</text>
  <text start="1009.23" dur="4.89">it is about centralizing their control</text>
  <text start="1012.02" dur="5.52">over those who are running those</text>
  <text start="1014.12" dur="7.14">countries the TPP was to centralize</text>
  <text start="1017.54" dur="7.02">everything by putting a a court system</text>
  <text start="1021.26" dur="5.34">above governments to control everything</text>
  <text start="1024.56" dur="5.46">below them so the name of the game is</text>
  <text start="1026.6" dur="5.49">control and we the people need to take</text>
  <text start="1030.02" dur="5.31">control back we need to take control</text>
  <text start="1032.09" dur="4.95">away from the central bank away from the</text>
  <text start="1035.33" dur="3.89">intelligent agencies away from the</text>
  <text start="1037.04" dur="4.35">corporate media and decentralize</text>
  <text start="1039.22" dur="4.57">everything this way you hear voices</text>
  <text start="1041.39" dur="4.17">coming from everywhere and people can</text>
  <text start="1043.79" dur="3.33">listen to many different things and make</text>
  <text start="1045.56" dur="2.79">their decision this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1047.12" dur="2.67">trying to get rid of the alternative</text>
  <text start="1048.35" dur="3.27">media this is why they&amp;#39;ve been taking</text>
  <text start="1049.79" dur="3.9">channels down this is why they give</text>
  <text start="1051.62" dur="3.63">strikes to channels they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1053.69" dur="5.01">everything they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="1055.25" dur="5.82">eliminate the decentralization so this</text>
