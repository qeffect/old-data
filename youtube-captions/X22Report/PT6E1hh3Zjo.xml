  <text start="451.74" dur="6.9">don&amp;#39;t know that he&amp;#39;s included with this</text>
  <text start="454.86" dur="5.67">but this is very interesting now the</text>
  <text start="458.64" dur="4.8">other interesting thing is is that the</text>
  <text start="460.53" dur="7.23">Federal Reserve they appeared on 60</text>
  <text start="463.44" dur="7.2">minutes and the question is why now so</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="5.82">Jerome Powell was interviewed by Scott</text>
  <text start="470.64" dur="5.67">Pelley and he mentioned the fact that</text>
  <text start="473.58" dur="5.52">such discussions are rare and know the</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="6.45">last time a Fed had appeared on such a</text>
  <text start="479.1" dur="6.9">chat was Ben Bernanke back in 2010 so</text>
  <text start="482.76" dur="6.03">why did he feel the need to do this now</text>
  <text start="486" dur="5.55">we need to remember that Trump has been</text>
  <text start="488.79" dur="5.01">calling out the Fed the Fed is now in</text>
  <text start="491.55" dur="5.52">the public eye the central banks they</text>
  <text start="493.8" dur="5.25">like to hide in the shadows but this is</text>
  <text start="497.07" dur="4.98">impossible with Trump continually</text>
  <text start="499.05" dur="5.16">pointing the finger at the Fed the</text>
  <text start="502.05" dur="4.29">public is starting to realize the Fed</text>
  <text start="504.21" dur="4.35">are responsible for the economy when</text>
  <text start="506.34" dur="5.97">rates are pushed up the economy slows</text>
  <text start="508.56" dur="6.27">the stock market Falls the debt load</text>
  <text start="512.31" dur="5.609">right now is unsustainable and the</text>
  <text start="514.83" dur="6.36">central banks around the world cannot</text>
  <text start="517.919" dur="4.281">divert the attention away from them</text>
  <text start="521.19" dur="4.05">anymore</text>
  <text start="522.2" dur="4.6">everyone is starting to wake up people</text>
  <text start="525.24" dur="4.41">are starting to wonder why the central</text>
  <text start="526.8" dur="4.92">bank can print money and buy assets to</text>
  <text start="529.65" dur="4.47">save their portfolios of baby boomers</text>
  <text start="531.72" dur="4.83">yet the public can&amp;#39;t simply print money</text>
  <text start="534.12" dur="3.99">for stuff like health care education and</text>
  <text start="536.55" dur="3.21">roads and remember the Fed is not out</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="4.23">there telling everyone that they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="539.76" dur="5.39">creating currency out of thin thin air</text>
  <text start="542.34" dur="6.36">they use terms like quantitative easing</text>
  <text start="545.15" dur="4.96">stimulus and many other terms to make it</text>
  <text start="548.7" dur="3.18">look like they&amp;#39;re doing something</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="4.2">completely different than just you know</text>
  <text start="551.88" dur="5.26">pushing a button and having currency be</text>
  <text start="554.31" dur="7.54">created on a computer screen</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="7.59">but the monetary system is slowly being</text>
  <text start="561.85" dur="4.739">exposed for the scam that it is the</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="3.84">purpose of Powell appearing on 60</text>
  <text start="566.589" dur="6.18">minutes is to shine the light on what</text>
  <text start="568.57" dur="6.78">the Fed really is and Powell said</text>
  <text start="572.769" dur="4.651">something very interesting now remember</text>
  <text start="575.35" dur="4.62">this is on 60 minutes this is on</text>
  <text start="577.42" dur="4.74">mainstream media where millions of</text>
  <text start="579.97" dur="6.869">people are watching and this is the</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="7.77">perfect platform to show what the Fed</text>
  <text start="586.839" dur="7.981">has been doing what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="589.93" dur="8.43">and should we blame them now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="594.82" dur="8.22">interesting during the interview the</text>
  <text start="598.36" dur="7.409">host tried to have Powell turn on the</text>
  <text start="603.04" dur="6.27">President to blame the president for</text>
  <text start="605.769" dur="7.471">pushing a lot of pressure on the Fed and</text>
  <text start="609.31" dur="5.73">he quoted Trump and this is what Trump</text>
  <text start="613.24" dur="2.19">said no I think the Fed is making a</text>
  <text start="615.04" dur="3.27">mistake</text>
  <text start="615.43" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re so tight I think the Fed has</text>
  <text start="618.31" dur="5.219">gone crazy Jerome Powell responded to</text>
  <text start="621.61" dur="4.169">this saying I don&amp;#39;t think it would be</text>
  <text start="623.529" dur="4.951">appropriate for me to comment on other</text>
  <text start="625.779" dur="5.49">elected officials or on the president</text>
  <text start="628.48" dur="4.919">and the host said isn&amp;#39;t it your duty to</text>
  <text start="631.269" dur="5.391">respond when the president calls the Fed</text>
  <text start="633.399" dur="8.521">a much bigger problem than China and</text>
  <text start="636.66" dur="8.53">Powell answered with this response my</text>
  <text start="641.92" dur="5.88">duty is one that Congress has given us</text>
  <text start="645.19" dur="6.54">which is to use our tools to achieve</text>
  <text start="647.8" dur="6.75">maximum employment and stable prices and</text>
  <text start="651.73" dur="4.95">to supervise and regulate banks so they</text>

  <text start="660.01" dur="6.389">perform their critical function in good</text>
  <text start="662.74" dur="6.18">times and bad that&amp;#39;s my job now he said</text>
  <text start="666.399" dur="3.8">something within this statement that&amp;#39;s</text>
