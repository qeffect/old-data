  <text start="129.31" dur="7.98">pushed up and at this point in time we</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="5.71">understand and we realize that this</text>
  <text start="137.29" dur="6.69">economy is about to implode on itself</text>
  <text start="140.11" dur="7.02">and there are strange warnings that are</text>
  <text start="143.98" dur="5.819">out there and very interesting things</text>
  <text start="147.13" dur="3.81">that are happening all at once we have</text>
  <text start="149.799" dur="4.321">the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</text>
  <text start="150.94" dur="6.359">president robert kaplan he warned we are</text>
  <text start="154.12" dur="4.53">highly leveraged and he is warning Trump</text>
  <text start="157.299" dur="4.831">that the country&amp;#39;s ability to boost</text>
  <text start="158.65" dur="5.399">growth from debt is limited that appears</text>
  <text start="162.13" dur="4.32">mr. Compton was fine with President</text>
  <text start="164.049" dur="5.821">Obama&amp;#39;s doubling of the national debt as</text>
  <text start="166.45" dur="6.48">the Fed held rate at zeros during his</text>
  <text start="169.87" dur="5.97">term but now there might be trouble at</text>
  <text start="172.93" dur="6.96">this point so what are we seeing happen</text>
  <text start="175.84" dur="5.78">here well the Federal Reserve they are</text>
  <text start="179.89" dur="4.79">preparing and getting ready</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="6.39">to bring this system completely down now</text>
  <text start="184.68" dur="7.26">Trump understands as he realizes what</text>
  <text start="188.01" dur="6.36">they are doing he just created this new</text>
  <text start="191.94" dur="4.14">memorandum now this new memorandum is</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="4.41">going to counter his executive order</text>
  <text start="196.08" dur="5.4">where he had this hiring free and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="6.81">going to release this new memorandum</text>
  <text start="201.48" dur="6.839">maybe on thursday and it will lift the</text>
  <text start="205.59" dur="5.13">hiring freeze but will require federal</text>
  <text start="208.319" dur="6.181">agencies to submit plans from making</text>
  <text start="210.72" dur="6.989">themselves leaner now he&amp;#39;s rethinking</text>
  <text start="214.5" dur="5.819">the entire structure of the federal</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="5.39">government and what he wants to do is he</text>
  <text start="220.319" dur="6.361">wants each part of the government to</text>
  <text start="223.099" dur="6.22">basically show how they&amp;#39;re going to cut</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="5.94">the workforce how they&amp;#39;re going to save</text>
  <text start="229.319" dur="6.06">money now think about why he is doing</text>
  <text start="232.62" dur="5.149">this what would be the purpose of him</text>
  <text start="235.379" dur="5.881">having each one of these different areas</text>
  <text start="237.769" dur="7.69">cut the number of people cut the budget</text>
  <text start="241.26" dur="7.949">and become really really lean because</text>
  <text start="245.459" dur="5.941">he&amp;#39;s doing this because he realizes once</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="4.021">the system comes down there&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="251.4" dur="5.79">to be any funds to keep the system going</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="6.93">so the government has to be really lean</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="5.43">now he&amp;#39;s changing the basic function and</text>
  <text start="260.16" dur="4.77">the responsibilities of many agencies</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="4.56">he&amp;#39;s getting rid of a lot of the</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="5.88">agencies and this is all being done on</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="6.959">purpose he&amp;#39;s reshaping the government</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="4.859">he&amp;#39;s reshaping the budget and of course</text>
  <text start="274.139" dur="2.881">Congress is not going to like this</text>
  <text start="275.669" dur="4.441">essential bankers aren&amp;#39;t going to like</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="5.88">this and this is why we see them rushing</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="5.13">to bring this system down now we know</text>
  <text start="282.9" dur="5.22">the fed well they&amp;#39;re going to stop the</text>
  <text start="285.24" dur="4.83">easy money now they&amp;#39;re doing this into</text>
  <text start="288.12" dur="4.229">the weakest economy that we&amp;#39;ve pretty</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="5.31">much ever seen actually if the gdp</text>
  <text start="292.349" dur="5.82">forecast for q1 are correct this will be</text>
  <text start="295.38" dur="5.009">the weakest economy since 1987 in which</text>
  <text start="298.169" dur="4.051">the rates were increased in fact this</text>
  <text start="300.389" dur="5.581">could be the lowest since the fourth</text>
  <text start="302.22" dur="5.94">quarter of 1980 now the said Janet</text>
  <text start="305.97" dur="4.77">Yellen I should just say she was patting</text>
  <text start="308.16" dur="5.58">herself on the back saying that the Fed</text>
  <text start="310.74" dur="4.14">did a fantastic job with the financial</text>
  <text start="313.74" dur="3.59">system</text>
  <text start="314.88" dur="7.05">and after eight years they just</text>
  <text start="317.33" dur="8.83">completely made this entire economy one</text>
  <text start="321.93" dur="6.21">great healthy recovered economy and</text>
  <text start="326.16" dur="4.53">she&amp;#39;s all out there slapping herself on</text>
  <text start="328.14" dur="4.32">the back praising the Fed for doing a</text>
  <text start="330.69" dur="6.69">great job but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="332.46" dur="8.13">about this is what the Fed said now fed</text>
  <text start="337.38" dur="6.75">officials plan to continue gradually</text>
  <text start="340.59" dur="6.66">raising interest rates unless the</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="5.88">economy begins to deteriorate and if it</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="6.09">begins to deteriorate what they&amp;#39;ll do is</text>
  <text start="350.01" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;ll reverse the policy of raising</text>
  <text start="353.34" dur="6.33">the interest rates and bring the rates</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="7.68">down hmm very interesting now why would</text>
  <text start="359.67" dur="6.06">they say that at this point because they</text>
  <text start="363.48" dur="5.1">understand that they&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="365.73" dur="5.97">thing they did prior to the crash of</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="5.76">2008 2009 where they raised the interest</text>
  <text start="371.7" dur="5.55">rates the economy really heated up got</text>
  <text start="374.34" dur="4.83">really crazy started to fall apart rip</text>
  <text start="377.25" dur="3.03">itself apart and then they started the</text>
  <text start="379.17" dur="3.09">lower the interest rates because they</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="4.32">knew that they would have to lower the</text>
  <text start="382.26" dur="3.51">interest rates they are doing the same</text>
  <text start="384.6" dur="3.84">thing right now actually they just</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="5.13">telegraphed everyone exactly what</text>
  <text start="388.44" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re going to raise the</text>
  <text start="390.9" dur="4.68">interest rates until the economy starts</text>
  <text start="393.12" dur="4.47">ripping itself apart once it starts</text>
  <text start="395.58" dur="3.87">ripping itself apart they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="397.59" dur="3.45">start lowering it and this is why Ben</text>
  <text start="399.45" dur="3.93">Bernanke was out there and we said this</text>
  <text start="401.04" dur="5.16">many times before this is why he said</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="6">listen the next economic crisis the next</text>
  <text start="406.2" dur="5.64">go around here the Fed most likely will</text>
  <text start="409.38" dur="4.62">have to go into into the negative area</text>
  <text start="411.84" dur="4.26">and the negative area is the negative</text>
  <text start="414" dur="3.99">interest rates and this is why we see</text>
  <text start="416.1" dur="5.61">the central bankers right now this is</text>
  <text start="417.99" dur="6.62">why they are preparing to stop the flow</text>
  <text start="421.71" dur="5.88">of free money raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="4.36">stopping the stimulus guess that guess</text>
  <text start="427.59" dur="4.44">what that&amp;#39;s going to do to the economy</text>
  <text start="428.97" dur="6.44">it&amp;#39;s going to bring it down now the top</text>
  <text start="432.03" dur="7.17">and to bring this full circle the IMF</text>
  <text start="435.41" dur="7.3">put out this document and they are</text>
  <text start="439.2" dur="5.85">talking about global income inequality</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="5.25">and what&amp;#39;s happening with the economy</text>
  <text start="445.05" dur="3.57">now we understand that the deep state</text>
  <text start="447.96" dur="2.989">the central</text>
  <text start="448.62" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing the idea that</text>
  <text start="450.949" dur="6.161">Russia is pushing a lot of</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="7.26">disinformation actually a senator mark</text>
  <text start="457.11" dur="6.39">Marco Rubio claimed Putin was engaged in</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="5.51">informational warfare seeking to exploit</text>
  <text start="463.5" dur="7.08">social protests in order to portray</text>
  <text start="466.1" dur="6.01">America as a disaster mark warner the</text>
  <text start="470.58" dur="3.96">ranking Democrat on the Intelligence</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="5.07">Committee claimed that Russia was using</text>
  <text start="474.54" dur="6.15">disinformation to undermined America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.18" dur="5.79">strength and leadership I don&amp;#39;t think we</text>
  <text start="480.69" dur="4.47">need Russia to do this I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="482.97" dur="3.69">doing this on their own but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="485.16" dur="3.06">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="486.66" dur="4.259">the IMF they came out with this paper</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="5.759">and it pointed out that the rising</text>
  <text start="490.919" dur="5.821">inequality can fuel social tensions and</text>
  <text start="493.979" dur="5.22">also harm economic growth and that low</text>
  <text start="496.74" dur="4.86">productivity growth a cara ristic</text>
  <text start="499.199" dur="4.47">feature of the major economies leaves</text>
  <text start="501.6" dur="5.189">little room for expectation of future</text>
  <text start="503.669" dur="5.631">wage growth and basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.789" dur="6.391">saying is because of Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.3" dur="7.21">interference and disinformation they are</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="6.57">most likely the main cause of the</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="6.529">problems we are having in the economy so</text>
  <text start="519.75" dur="6.839">they&amp;#39;re already setting up the idea that</text>
  <text start="523.039" dur="5.92">Russia is responsible for this and if</text>
  <text start="526.589" dur="4.561">you notice the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="528.959" dur="4.911">bankers they are all doing the same</text>
  <text start="531.15" dur="6.6">thing they&amp;#39;re trying to shift the blame</text>
  <text start="533.87" dur="6.31">over to Russia now why is this why would</text>
  <text start="537.75" dur="5.52">they want to shift the blame because</text>
  <text start="540.18" dur="6.24">they understand once again that this</text>
  <text start="543.27" dur="4.83">economy is coming down the Fed they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="546.42" dur="4.68">already telegraphed what they&amp;#39;re about</text>

  <text start="551.1" dur="4.44">get out there and tell everyone through</text>
  <text start="553.32" dur="5.7">pictures like on The Economist&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="6.299">they showed the 2018 where there&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="559.02" dur="6.36">that is now in gold the hundred-dollar</text>
  <text start="561.839" dur="5.911">bill they love to put these ideas out</text>
  <text start="565.38" dur="4.59">there to show everyone exactly what</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re going to do they even try to put</text>
  <text start="569.97" dur="4.59">dates on certain things to show everyone</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="5.01">that this is when we&amp;#39;re planning to do</text>
  <text start="574.56" dur="4.14">this and we can see from everything that</text>

  <text start="578.7" dur="5.86">that&amp;#39;s been said from everything that</text>
  <text start="582.04" dur="5.669">we have covered the time is getting</text>
