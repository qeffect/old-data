  <text start="69.869" dur="8.461">over this but the question is why did</text>
  <text start="73.77" dur="8.519">Trump decide it was necessary to tweet</text>

  <text start="110.94" dur="6.03">out of the water what does this mean</text>
  <text start="112.8" dur="7.409">this means that Boris Johnson is going</text>

  <text start="175.02" dur="6.18">resign if he fails to deliver brexit by</text>
  <text start="177.84" dur="5.19">October 31st providing he is in power in</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="4.79">the first place which it looks like he</text>
  <text start="183.03" dur="6.51">will be and as you can see the people</text>
  <text start="185.99" dur="7.36">they are telling the government</text>
  <text start="189.54" dur="7.17">officials what they want they want a</text>
  <text start="193.35" dur="5.61">brexit they want someone who&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="196.71" dur="5.52">follow through this is why there was a</text>
  <text start="198.96" dur="7.53">referendum this is why people voted to</text>

  <text start="213.54" dur="4.83">to step aside now remember the EU</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever they possibly</text>
  <text start="218.37" dur="7.14">can to stop all of this most of the time</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="5.61">they use fear to make people change</text>
  <text start="225.51" dur="4.17">their minds but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="4.53">happen this time because we see Nigel</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="4.5">Ferran with his brexit party we see</text>
  <text start="231.93" dur="4.71">Boris Johnson out there saying yes we</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="5.61">are leaving October 31st no matter what</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="6.99">and these individuals realize that they</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="5.85">better follow through now here in the</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="4.77">United States trump is letting the</text>
  <text start="245.64" dur="5.61">public know that the US was funding many</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="5.19">countries for years this was part of the</text>
  <text start="251.25" dur="4.29">globalist central bank deep state plan</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="5.34">Trump is letting everyone know that</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="6.39">tariffs give the u.s. leverage and Trump</text>
  <text start="258.93" dur="5.91">twigged out the following when you are a</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="4.68">big piggy bank that other countries have</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="3.84">been ripping off for years to a level</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="4.32">that is not to be believed</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="4.71">tariffs are a great negotiating tool a</text>
  <text start="270.93" dur="4.35">great revenue producer and most</text>
  <text start="273.39" dur="4.83">importantly a powerful way to get</text>
  <text start="275.28" dur="4.32">companies to come to the USA and to get</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="3.12">companies that have left us for other</text>
  <text start="279.6" dur="5.64">lands to come back home</text>
  <text start="281.34" dur="4.56">we stupidly lost 30% of our business to</text>
  <text start="285.24" dur="2.91">Mexico</text>
  <text start="285.9" dur="4.26">if the terrace went on at the highest</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="4.8">higher level they would all come back</text>
  <text start="290.16" dur="5.22">and fast but very happy with the deal I</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="4.56">made if Mexico produces which I think</text>
  <text start="295.38" dur="4.56">they will biggest part of deal with</text>
  <text start="297.51" dur="5.16">Mexico has not been revealed china is</text>
  <text start="299.94" dur="4.68">similar except they devalue currency M</text>
  <text start="302.67" dur="5.1">says of subsidized their companies to</text>
  <text start="304.62" dur="5.4">less an effect of 25% tariff so far</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="5.34">little effect to consumers companies</text>
  <text start="310.02" dur="6.81">will relocate to us Trump is right the</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="6.51">tariffs had a very very little effect or</text>
  <text start="316.83" dur="4.8">none at all I mean the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="5.73">was out there saying iPhones they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="321.63" dur="5.94">gonna go from you know $1,000 to $1,100</text>
  <text start="325.35" dur="3.99">TVs are gonna skyrocket actually</text>
  <text start="327.57" dur="3.84">everything&amp;#39;s coming down in price so</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="4.68">they were completely wrong about that</text>
  <text start="331.41" dur="6.51">and we explained how tariffs actually</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="6.51">work the 25% is not on the people the</text>
  <text start="337.92" dur="6.18">25% is on the first middleman so if</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="7.04">China sells a product for 10 bucks its</text>
  <text start="344.1" dur="7.59">25% on the 10 bucks and yes after that</text>
  <text start="347.57" dur="7.51">the cost goes up for that item</text>
  <text start="351.69" dur="6.42">but the middleman absorbs all of this</text>
  <text start="355.08" dur="6.63">and most of the time we don&amp;#39;t see any of</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="7.35">this but what it does do it brings in a</text>
  <text start="361.71" dur="6.78">lot of currency to the United States</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="5.64">which we weren&amp;#39;t getting before now like</text>
  <text start="368.49" dur="3.9">I said in the beginning trouble said</text>
  <text start="371.1" dur="4.98">something very interesting about</text>
  <text start="372.39" dur="5.55">cryptocurrency the question is why now</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="4.89">did he decide to mention Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="377.94" dur="3.81">Libra in the same breath because the</text>
  <text start="380.97" dur="3.66">deep state</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="6.69">the central bank they were planning to</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="4.92">use Libra to destroy the US economy and</text>
  <text start="388.44" dur="4.65">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna wait what are you</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="6.6">saying what wait what let&amp;#39;s go back in</text>
  <text start="393.09" dur="6.92">time just a little bit here when Trump</text>
  <text start="396.15" dur="6.42">was first coming in to the White House</text>
  <text start="400.01" dur="5.14">what was the Fed doing what was the deep</text>
  <text start="402.57" dur="7.92">state doing well they were planning to</text>
  <text start="405.15" dur="8.76">remove Trump from office and they had</text>
  <text start="410.49" dur="6.3">the Fed raised rates this was going to</text>
  <text start="413.91" dur="5.31">happen and the economy was going to</text>
  <text start="416.79" dur="5.45">crash they also had the fake dossier</text>
  <text start="419.22" dur="5.94">they had Muller they tried everything</text>
  <text start="422.24" dur="5.38">but what did the Patriots do they</text>
  <text start="425.16" dur="5.4">reversed the plan the Fed is now going</text>
  <text start="427.62" dur="3.48">to cut rates and start stimulus so we</text>
  <text start="430.56" dur="3.78">scratch that</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="5.67">playing off the board here Trump also</text>
  <text start="434.34" dur="4.56">reworked the globus trade deals creating</text>
  <text start="436.77" dur="5.49">new trade deals with countries preparing</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="5.61">the US economy for the new economy one</text>
  <text start="442.26" dur="4.47">without the Central Bank now the deep</text>
  <text start="444.51" dur="5.22">state the central bank they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="446.73" dur="4.11">introduce a new country currency via</text>
  <text start="449.73" dur="3.42">Facebook</text>
  <text start="450.84" dur="4.68">remember Facebook is an intelligence</text>
  <text start="453.15" dur="5.7">design social media app it was called</text>
  <text start="455.52" dur="6.3">life log since fake Facebook has</text>
  <text start="458.85" dur="6.42">millions of people on their platform</text>
  <text start="461.82" dur="6.57">they could use cryptocurrency to crash</text>
  <text start="465.27" dur="5.88">this system let&amp;#39;s go back in time a</text>
  <text start="468.39" dur="4.86">little bit this was done before actually</text>
  <text start="471.15" dur="4.5">not with cryptocurrency of course</text>
  <text start="473.25" dur="5.01">because it didn&amp;#39;t exist but during the</text>
  <text start="475.65" dur="5.19">Revolutionary War the British tried to</text>
  <text start="478.26" dur="9.42">crash the US economy at the time by</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="8.4">introducing fake currency what yes let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="5">go back and this is from the Journal of</text>
  <text start="489.24" dur="6.66">the American Revolution to this end a</text>
  <text start="492.68" dur="5.17">campaign was devised to undermine the</text>
  <text start="495.9" dur="5.1">American economy an attempt to achieve</text>
  <text start="497.85" dur="5.55">eight whopper if the economy was in</text>
  <text start="501" dur="4.11">shambles the Americans would not be able</text>
  <text start="503.4" dur="4.2">to purchase the men and materiel needed</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="4.5">to continue the war at the same time by</text>
  <text start="507.6" dur="3.63">undermining the economy they would also</text>
  <text start="509.61" dur="3.869">be undermining the American Congress</text>
  <text start="511.23" dur="4.499">which was acting as the central</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="4.471">government perhaps if people lost faith</text>
  <text start="515.729" dur="5.49">in the Congress they would realize that</text>
  <text start="517.95" dur="6">war could not be won and they would all</text>
  <text start="521.219" dur="4.081">return to the fold while it is hard to</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="2.64">say whether anyone in the British</text>
  <text start="525.3" dur="3.12">government sat down and actually put</text>
  <text start="526.59" dur="3.87">together a comprehensive plan it is</text>
  <text start="528.42" dur="4.92">obvious that several different measures</text>
  <text start="530.46" dur="4.47">were undertaken these included attempts</text>
  <text start="533.34" dur="3.93">to limit American trade with foreign</text>
  <text start="534.93" dur="4.62">nations using all powerful British Navy</text>
  <text start="537.27" dur="4.35">to to interdict as much overseas</text>
  <text start="539.55" dur="3.99">commerce as possible as well as</text>
  <text start="541.62" dur="3.87">searching vessels from neutral countries</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="3.81">for warm and chills enroute to America</text>
  <text start="545.49" dur="4.2">this move in particular was frowned upon</text>
  <text start="547.35" dur="4.47">by many European nations while these</text>
  <text start="549.69" dur="4.74">activities were effective to a point the</text>
  <text start="551.82" dur="5.4">most effective strategy that was tried</text>
  <text start="554.43" dur="4.82">and one that very nearly succeeded was</text>
  <text start="557.22" dur="3.96">the masses massive undertaking of</text>
  <text start="559.25" dur="4.73">counterfeiting congressional paper</text>
  <text start="561.18" dur="5.53">currency to the point of making it all</text>
  <text start="563.98" dur="6.45">most worthless thus crashing the</text>
  <text start="566.71" dur="5.82">American economy no economy normal war</text>
  <text start="570.43" dur="4.23">in looking at the strategy three</text>
  <text start="572.53" dur="4.41">questions must be asked how are the fake</text>
  <text start="574.66" dur="3.99">notes produced and circulated was it</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="4.38">effective in undermining the economy</text>
  <text start="578.65" dur="4.41">finally was this a sanctioned strategy</text>
  <text start="581.32" dur="3.75">by the British one that they knowingly</text>
  <text start="583.06" dur="3.87">pursued looking at the counterfeiting</text>
  <text start="585.07" dur="3.45">strategy through these questions</text>
  <text start="586.93" dur="3.27">presents an intriguing and often</text>

  <text start="593.47" dur="3.78">circulation</text>
  <text start="594.4" dur="5.13">they used several different methods one</text>
  <text start="597.25" dur="4.11">involve finding men who had deserted the</text>
  <text start="599.53" dur="4.08">Patriot cause and fled to British lines</text>
  <text start="601.36" dur="4.38">lining their pockets with fake cash and</text>
  <text start="603.61" dur="4.74">convincing them to cross back over and</text>
  <text start="605.74" dur="4.23">spend what they could of course they</text>
  <text start="608.35" dur="3.99">would have to be careful as to not</text>
  <text start="609.97" dur="4.32">arouse suspicion but with this method</text>
  <text start="612.34" dur="3.72">hundreds of fake continental dollars we</text>
