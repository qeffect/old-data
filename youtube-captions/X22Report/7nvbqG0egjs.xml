  <text start="68.59" dur="5.279">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="70.81" dur="6.15">news now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at many many</text>
  <text start="73.869" dur="5.311">different indicators with regards to the</text>
  <text start="76.96" dur="5.04">economy and we are seeing that a lot of</text>
  <text start="79.18" dur="5.37">these indicators are flashing at us</text>
  <text start="82" dur="5.07">bright red telling us we are in a</text>
  <text start="84.55" dur="5.7">recession heading towards a depression</text>
  <text start="87.07" dur="6.12">the Chicago Fed national activity index</text>
  <text start="90.25" dur="4.259">rose to a negative point zero eight in</text>
  <text start="93.19" dur="4.2">October from negative point two three</text>
  <text start="94.509" dur="5.521">and the October reading shows us</text>
  <text start="97.39" dur="4.259">economic growth really isn&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="100.03" dur="3.54">anywhere we&amp;#39;re still in the negative</text>
  <text start="101.649" dur="4.951">range but when we look at the index</text>
  <text start="103.57" dur="5.159">three month moving average which tends</text>
  <text start="106.6" dur="5.22">to offer a clearer picture of the trend</text>
  <text start="108.729" dur="5.43">in the economic activity and the monthly</text>
  <text start="111.82" dur="6.92">reading alone well it weakened to</text>
  <text start="114.159" dur="8.731">negative point 27 and this tells us that</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="7.33">this economy that we&amp;#39;re in it is T</text>
  <text start="122.89" dur="7.289">rating very very quickly in September it</text>
  <text start="126.07" dur="6.84">was at a negative point too so what</text>
  <text start="130.179" dur="5.221">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the economy is</text>
  <text start="132.91" dur="4.74">under a lot of pressure we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="135.4" dur="3.99">lot of manipulation and we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="137.65" dur="5.55">a lot of manipulation of lot of the data</text>
  <text start="139.39" dur="5.7">that they&amp;#39;re throwing at us and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="143.2" dur="5.099">looked at like the auto sale numbers</text>
  <text start="145.09" dur="6.39">where they channel stuff the mat the</text>
  <text start="148.299" dur="6">auto dealerships they call that sales</text>
  <text start="151.48" dur="6.539">when they stuffed a lot we know with</text>
  <text start="154.299" dur="6.361">unemployment people have just fallen off</text>
  <text start="158.019" dur="5.431">the job market we know they count part</text>
  <text start="160.66" dur="5.31">time jobs as full-time jobs when those</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="5.069">part time jobs have ended the people</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="6.12">have gotten laid off most of them well</text>
  <text start="168.519" dur="5.731">they&amp;#39;re not counted as a loss and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.09" dur="3.57">starting to get information that these</text>
  <text start="174.25" dur="5.64">retail numbers that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="175.66" dur="5.38">throwing at us well they are manipulated</text>
  <text start="179.89" dur="4.989">and we can see</text>
  <text start="181.04" dur="6.569">how they&amp;#39;re manipulating them the census</text>
  <text start="184.879" dur="5.22">bureau announced retail sales for</text>
  <text start="187.609" dur="4.83">October and they were out there telling</text>
  <text start="190.099" dur="4.291">us so it&amp;#39;s a point eight percent and we</text>
  <text start="192.439" dur="6.541">look through them and we said yes a lot</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="8.12">of the gas prices push them up and for</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="7.83">these retail numbers what they do is</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="6.55">something very very interesting the</text>
  <text start="206.81" dur="5.399">Census Bureau and other government</text>
  <text start="209.06" dur="5.549">agencies compile figures and they use</text>
  <text start="212.209" dur="5.31">adjusted seasonal variations and</text>
  <text start="214.609" dur="5.011">holidays and trading day differences in</text>
  <text start="217.519" dur="3.181">all these different things to manipulate</text>
  <text start="219.62" dur="3.959">him a little bit but that&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="220.7" dur="5.099">talking about for example health &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="223.579" dur="3.931">personal care stores had a whopping</text>
  <text start="225.799" dur="4.711">seven point six percent increase in</text>
  <text start="227.51" dur="9.539">October but underneath that calculation</text>
  <text start="230.51" dur="9.36">there is no data only an asterisk and if</text>
  <text start="237.049" dur="5.22">you go down to the footnote it says that</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="4.89">advance estimates are not available for</text>
  <text start="242.269" dur="6.18">this kind of business so then how did</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="6.539">the Census Bureau determine that sales</text>
  <text start="248.449" dur="5.79">were a seven point six percent increase</text>
  <text start="251.299" dur="6.75">in health and personal care for those</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="5.97">stores if it doesn&amp;#39;t provide any data it</text>
  <text start="258.049" dur="4.11">something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense well</text>
  <text start="260.209" dur="4.051">furniture and home furnishing stores</text>
  <text start="262.159" dur="5.25">also had a three point four percent</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="8.61">sales increase but again the same thing</text>
  <text start="267.409" dur="8.25">there was no data so when data is</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="5.64">provided to this census bureau those</text>
  <text start="275.659" dur="5.79">number are not necessarily used in the</text>
  <text start="278.51" dur="5.67">calculations for instance if the</text>
  <text start="281.449" dur="5.791">analysts at the Census Bureau think that</text>
  <text start="284.18" dur="6.68">one of the company&amp;#39;s data that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="6.98">given the Census Bureau is not credible</text>
  <text start="290.86" dur="7.63">they can have their computers impute</text>
  <text start="294.22" dur="6.55">what the right figure might be and if</text>
  <text start="298.49" dur="4.709">they disagree with those numbers the</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="7.709">computer comes up with they can do</text>
  <text start="303.199" dur="7.561">something called a hand trend many</text>
  <text start="308.479" dur="3.571">people call it spit bowling coming up</text>
  <text start="310.76" dur="3.269">with sales numbers for a retailer</text>
  <text start="312.05" dur="3.729">because the one provided by the company</text>
  <text start="314.029" dur="6.89">or the compute</text>
  <text start="315.779" dur="6.79">computation didn&amp;#39;t feel right Apple for</text>
  <text start="320.919" dur="5.61">instance won&amp;#39;t provide monthly numbers</text>
  <text start="322.569" dur="5.611">to the Census Bureau and how can anyone</text>
  <text start="326.529" dur="3.48">know what the technology industry is</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="6.389">doing if apple&amp;#39;s iphone 7 numbers are</text>
  <text start="330.009" dur="6.96">completely missing another example if a</text>
  <text start="334.569" dur="5.91">change store goes out of business for</text>
  <text start="336.969" dur="6.69">instance its sales don&amp;#39;t drop to zero so</text>
  <text start="340.479" dur="6.27">if all the stores closed they don&amp;#39;t drop</text>
  <text start="343.659" dur="11.25">to zero automatically they phase them</text>
  <text start="346.749" dur="13.14">out slowly over many months because they</text>
  <text start="354.909" dur="8.49">don&amp;#39;t want to hurt the statistics I mean</text>
  <text start="359.889" dur="7.92">this is complete and utter manipulation</text>
  <text start="363.399" dur="8.1">of the system these retails numbers they</text>
  <text start="367.809" dur="6.42">are worthless they tell us absolutely</text>
  <text start="371.499" dur="3.81">nothing because if they don&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="374.229" dur="3.39">numbers they&amp;#39;re receiving or if they</text>
  <text start="375.309" dur="3.961">don&amp;#39;t have the numbers they just come up</text>
  <text start="377.619" dur="4.14">with numbers that they feel the industry</text>
  <text start="379.27" dur="4.439">is putting out there this is yeah you</text>
  <text start="381.759" dur="4.101">know the health care stores I think</text>
  <text start="383.709" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re doing about a seven percent</text>
  <text start="385.86" dur="6.389">sales that then that that&amp;#39;s the numbers</text>
  <text start="389.439" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re going to use here so once again</text>
  <text start="392.249" dur="5.41">we&amp;#39;re coming across where these numbers</text>
  <text start="394.959" dur="5.07">are completely manipulated they make no</text>
  <text start="397.659" dur="4.44">sense and if many many stores close down</text>
  <text start="400.029" dur="5.16">all at once they go bankrupt the door</text>
  <text start="402.099" dur="6.18">shut everything just doesn&amp;#39;t drop to</text>
  <text start="405.189" dur="5.31">zero and now everyone who is thinking</text>
  <text start="408.279" dur="5.37">like now this is starting to make sense</text>
  <text start="410.499" dur="5.64">now I understand like you know if sports</text>
  <text start="413.649" dur="4.461">authority completely goes out how can</text>
  <text start="416.139" dur="4.471">Sporting Goods still be doing well well</text>
  <text start="418.11" dur="5.769">over many months four five six seven</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="9.329">months they phase it out slowly so you</text>
  <text start="423.879" dur="10.56">can&amp;#39;t notice anything but again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="429.939" dur="7.59">manipulating the data completely which</text>
  <text start="434.439" dur="7.08">shows us this economy right now is much</text>
  <text start="437.529" dur="5.25">worse then we really know and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="441.519" dur="3.091">tracking it following it and</text>
  <text start="442.779" dur="5.611">understanding it and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="444.61" dur="5.37">right now is things are much much worse</text>
  <text start="448.39" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;ve ever thought actually this holiday</text>
  <text start="449.98" dur="4.83">season is going to be a complete and</text>
  <text start="452.08" dur="4.38">utter disaster because these retail</text>
  <text start="454.81" dur="3.9">numbers are going to throw at us we know</text>
  <text start="456.46" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re completely fake we know that</text>
  <text start="458.71" dur="4.17">stores are going to be closing down we</text>
  <text start="461.41" dur="3.24">know the sales aren&amp;#39;t going to be there</text>
  <text start="462.88" dur="3.99">I mean if you look right now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="5.07">been telling us Black Friday sales for</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="7.98">almost every day leading up to black</text>
  <text start="469.72" dur="8.19">friday this tells you something we see</text>
  <text start="474.85" dur="6.11">the CEO of UBS and credit Swiss the</text>
  <text start="477.91" dur="6.42">former CEO I should say Oswald rubel</text>
  <text start="480.96" dur="5.74">well he&amp;#39;s criticizing the growing</text>
  <text start="484.33" dur="4.08">strength of central banks and their</text>
  <text start="486.7" dur="4.62">supremacy over the markets and other</text>
  <text start="488.41" dur="4.35">banks he&amp;#39;s saying that right now with</text>
  <text start="491.32" dur="5.37">the use of negative interest rates and</text>
  <text start="492.76" dur="8">huge positive balance sheets well it</text>
  <text start="496.69" dur="8.03">looks like the central banks right now</text>
  <text start="500.76" dur="6.1">they are at the point of no return and</text>
  <text start="504.72" dur="6.16">this whole thing will end in a</text>
  <text start="506.86" dur="7.47">disastrous crash and that&amp;#39;s where we are</text>
  <text start="510.88" dur="7.05">headed towards a disastrous crash and</text>
  <text start="514.33" dur="6.44">we&amp;#39;re getting indicators of what the</text>
  <text start="517.93" dur="7.08">central bank&amp;#39;s next move is going to be</text>
  <text start="520.77" dur="5.71">it&amp;#39;s going to be a ban on cash because</text>
  <text start="525.01" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re already seeing it in Australia</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re seeing in India and this is going</text>
  <text start="528.91" dur="6.72">to intensify and spread to other</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="6.39">countries we also see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.63" dur="4.26">planning to raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="537.52" dur="4.11">this December now if they raise the</text>
  <text start="539.89" dur="3.78">interest rates this December it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="541.63" dur="6.39">going to be by much but they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="543.67" dur="7.38">put us on the path to crashing the</text>
  <text start="548.02" dur="4.47">system this is why they&amp;#39;re increasing</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="5.94">the interest rates right now when all</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="6.45">other areas are negative or zero because</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="4.14">when you look at this you can see that</text>
  <text start="558.94" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re preparing to ban cash because</text>
  <text start="561.13" dur="4.5">they want to keep the cash inside the</text>
  <text start="563.86" dur="6.24">bank they&amp;#39;re going to raise interest</text>
  <text start="565.63" dur="8.01">rates and that is going to lead to a</text>
  <text start="570.1" dur="8.03">crash so I personally think they will</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="5.81">raise the interest rates this December</text>
  <text start="578.13" dur="2.79">they did</text>
  <text start="579.45" dur="4.17">last December what happened to the</text>
  <text start="580.92" dur="5.52">markets well it looks like everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="7.32">already baked in right now and they are</text>
  <text start="586.44" dur="7.26">preparing to bring this system down we</text>
  <text start="590.94" dur="5.37">know that over the past every time is a</text>
  <text start="593.7" dur="5.64">two-term president the market always</text>
  <text start="596.31" dur="5.19">crashes with the next president we can</text>
  <text start="599.34" dur="3.93">see they&amp;#39;re setting it up to have the</text>
  <text start="601.5" dur="6.03">whole thing crashed during this period</text>
  <text start="603.27" dur="6.99">of time so we can see right now they are</text>
  <text start="607.53" dur="5.72">planning for this system to come down</text>
  <text start="610.26" dur="6.77">because look what has happened to ready</text>
  <text start="613.25" dur="7.99">the TPP is dead the TTIP is dead</text>
  <text start="617.03" dur="6.61">countries now are moving towards China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.24" dur="4.8">free trade deal we see Australia is</text>
  <text start="623.64" dur="4.05">doing this we see the Philippines are</text>
  <text start="626.04" dur="3.87">going to be doing this and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="627.69" dur="6.33">to see a lot of other countries doing</text>
  <text start="629.91" dur="6.87">that the u.s. is not going to be among</text>
  <text start="634.02" dur="5.22">the signatories for the free trade deal</text>
  <text start="636.78" dur="7.11">with China but we&amp;#39;re going to see many</text>
  <text start="639.24" dur="6.87">other countries making this deal and we</text>
  <text start="643.89" dur="7.28">can see already that everything is now</text>
  <text start="646.11" dur="7.44">shifting from the west to the east with</text>
  <text start="651.17" dur="6.67">everything they duplicated the payment</text>
  <text start="653.55" dur="8.1">system the shanghai gold exchange the</text>
  <text start="657.84" dur="5.94">yuan in the basket of sdrs everything is</text>
  <text start="661.65" dur="5.07">moving in that direction slowly but</text>
  <text start="663.78" dur="7.68">surely and look over time look what has</text>
  <text start="666.72" dur="8.72">happened and we can see that everything</text>
  <text start="671.46" dur="8.1">is now in full gear to move away from</text>
  <text start="675.44" dur="7.27">the dollar and this is why people need</text>
  <text start="679.56" dur="6.18">to be prepared and ready for this major</text>
  <text start="682.71" dur="6.45">crash we can see there intensifying the</text>
  <text start="685.74" dur="6.24">ban on cash most likely they&amp;#39;ll raise</text>
  <text start="689.16" dur="5.46">the interest rates in December this is a</text>
  <text start="691.98" dur="5.79">signal that everything is prepared and</text>
