  <text start="72.109" dur="6.19">people at this time now we understand</text>
  <text start="76.14" dur="3.6">that the government you know they do all</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="3.841">the calculations they figure out</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="5.07">unemployment and they always tell us</text>
  <text start="82.14" dur="4.14">that you know those people that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="84.81" dur="3.18">in the labor force those people are</text>
  <text start="86.28" dur="3.72">retiring they&amp;#39;re not looking for work</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="3.51">anymore and this is why do they are not</text>
  <text start="90" dur="2.7">being counted and we see this all over</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="3.24">the corporate media this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="5.19">doing and actually there was a report</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="5.519">and a study done showing that actually</text>
  <text start="97.89" dur="5.369">this is kind of false and right now the</text>
  <text start="100.259" dur="6.841">labor force the people who left the</text>
  <text start="103.259" dur="5.731">labor force exploded again another five</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="4.799">hundred and thirty-five thousand people</text>
  <text start="108.99" dur="5.369">and on februari 26 a report from the</text>
  <text start="111.899" dur="4.53">economic policy institute shows the</text>
  <text start="114.359" dur="3.87">following since the start of the Great</text>
  <text start="116.429" dur="5.43">Recession this is over about six years</text>
  <text start="118.229" dur="6.45">ago the labor force participation has</text>
  <text start="121.859" dur="4.981">dropped significantly most of the drop</text>
  <text start="124.679" dur="6.151">roughly three quarters was due to the</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="6.84">lack of job opportunities in the Great</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="6.03">Recession and it&amp;#39;s aftermath there are</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="5.58">now five point eight million workers who</text>
  <text start="136.86" dur="3.84">are not in the labor force but who would</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="4.619">be</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="6.869">in the labor force if there were jobs</text>
  <text start="143.879" dur="8.58">and those people who are no longer in</text>
  <text start="147.569" dur="7.981">the labor force are under 55 years old</text>
  <text start="152.459" dur="5.071">so they&amp;#39;re not actually retiring these</text>
  <text start="155.55" dur="5.189">are people who are looking for work</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re not retiring and there are just</text>
  <text start="160.739" dur="5.011">not enough jobs out there and we know</text>
  <text start="163.98" dur="4.44">this and I know from my friends and</text>
  <text start="165.75" dur="4.86">other people that I talk to that they</text>
  <text start="168.42" dur="6.27">continually put out resumes and they</text>
  <text start="170.61" dur="7.23">just don&amp;#39;t get any answers back for work</text>
  <text start="174.69" dur="5.34">and we see this happening now in the</text>
  <text start="177.84" dur="4.2">real estate market we understand that</text>
  <text start="180.03" dur="4.14">real estate is pretty much imploding we</text>
  <text start="182.04" dur="4.77">all get this at this point we understand</text>
  <text start="184.17" dur="4.08">that the big players on the mortgage</text>
  <text start="186.81" dur="3.989">departments they&amp;#39;ve been laying off</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="5.76">people the big players they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="190.799" dur="6.601">to get out and Blackstone acquisition</text>
  <text start="194.01" dur="6.92">pace has declined seventy percent from</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="6.03">its peak last year hmmm I wonder why and</text>
  <text start="200.93" dur="4.83">the private equity firm was spending</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="5.52">more than a hundred million a week</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="4.72">purchasing properties and after</text>
  <text start="208.95" dur="4.65">investing about eight billion since</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="6.18">April 2012 to buy about 43,000 homes in</text>
  <text start="213.6" dur="5.82">14 cities the company has narrowed most</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="5.97">of its purchases to Seattle Atlanta</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="5.129">Miami Orlando and Tampa and really</text>
  <text start="222.63" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re trying to get out of these</text>
  <text start="224.549" dur="5.461">markets they&amp;#39;re scaling back and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="4.59">saying you know what here you Americans</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="4.14">who really can&amp;#39;t afford anything try to</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="4.739">buy these homes and again they know they</text>
  <text start="234.15" dur="4.38">can&amp;#39;t this is why the mortgage</text>
  <text start="236.639" dur="3.841">applications have been dropping by sixty</text>
  <text start="238.53" dur="3.329">to sixty six percent this is why the</text>
  <text start="240.48" dur="5.28">mortgage companies are laying off people</text>
  <text start="241.859" dur="7.861">and again this is why we see this</text>
  <text start="245.76" dur="7.589">happening and then homes home prices</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="6.449">have continually gone up and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="253.349" dur="6.241">becoming unaffordable for the everyday</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="5.641">person and of course since the homes are</text>
  <text start="259.59" dur="4.53">too high what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="3.9">bringing back as well we know is the</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="3.6">adjustable rate mortgages they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="5.07">bringing back a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="267.72" dur="6.809">financing and there are giving loans out</text>
  <text start="270.78" dur="6.059">now to subprime people so black</text>
  <text start="274.529" dur="4.95">zone can get these houses off of their</text>
  <text start="276.839" dur="5.01">books because this is what they do at</text>
  <text start="279.479" dur="5.31">the end at the top of the bubble i</text>
  <text start="281.849" dur="4.47">should say they try to unload as much as</text>
  <text start="284.789" dur="3.81">they possibly can they drive the prices</text>
  <text start="286.319" dur="4.44">up then they gotta unload them but</text>
  <text start="288.599" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;s just no one there to purchase</text>
  <text start="290.759" dur="3.81">them and they realize this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.499" dur="6.36">trying to get rid of them as quickly as</text>
  <text start="294.569" dur="6.33">they possibly can now out in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="298.859" dur="3.9">we get it the United States does not</text>
  <text start="300.899" dur="3.81">want to leave that country they want to</text>
  <text start="302.759" dur="5.37">keep the troops in there because it is</text>
  <text start="304.709" dur="5.25">in a strategic location China is there</text>
  <text start="308.129" dur="4.26">if a huge amount of natural resources</text>
  <text start="309.959" dur="4.74">copper there is there Chinese are</text>
  <text start="312.389" dur="4.23">helping them mine it and they are</text>
  <text start="314.699" dur="4.32">growing the poppy fields we get this but</text>
  <text start="316.619" dur="4.35">Karzai said on Saturday that his</text>
  <text start="319.019" dur="3.66">military is ready to take over because</text>
  <text start="320.969" dur="3.81">it already protected ninety-three</text>
  <text start="322.679" dur="4.47">percent of the country and we&amp;#39;re strong</text>
  <text start="324.779" dur="4.83">enough to defend Afghanistan without the</text>
  <text start="327.149" dur="4.44">assistance of the United States and</text>
  <text start="329.609" dur="3.36">again the United States wants</text>
  <text start="331.589" dur="4.5">Afghanistan to sign the bilateral</text>
  <text start="332.969" dur="5.67">security agreement they do not want to</text>
  <text start="336.089" dur="4.41">Karzai&amp;#39;s leaving office and again the</text>
  <text start="338.639" dur="3.78">United States is going to wait for the</text>
  <text start="340.499" dur="3.96">next administration come in and try to</text>
  <text start="342.419" dur="4.98">force them to sign and you have to</text>
  <text start="344.459" dur="5.79">remember the Chinese already said listen</text>
  <text start="347.399" dur="5.58">if you need help fighting terrorism in</text>
  <text start="350.249" dur="4.89">your country we will help you because</text>
  <text start="352.979" dur="3.75">China right now is pouring in billions</text>
  <text start="355.139" dur="4.41">of dollars into the Afghan</text>
  <text start="356.729" dur="4.98">infrastructure and they are there just</text>
  <text start="359.549" dur="5.07">like their it there in libya and lebanon</text>
  <text start="361.709" dur="6.3">and in africa everywhere the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="364.619" dur="7.26">there&amp;#39;s china now yesterday I reported</text>
  <text start="368.009" dur="6.15">on that Treasuries were being dumped by</text>
  <text start="371.879" dur="4.68">foreigners in a tune of about a hundred</text>
  <text start="374.159" dur="4.89">and five billion and they&amp;#39;re not sure if</text>
  <text start="376.559" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s Russia or China I&amp;#39;m going to say</text>
  <text start="379.049" dur="2.79">it&amp;#39;s most likely like Russia because</text>
  <text start="380.459" dur="2.88">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is Russian</text>
  <text start="381.839" dur="3.72">companies are pulling billions out of</text>
  <text start="383.339" dur="3.93">Western banks fearful that any US</text>
  <text start="385.559" dur="4.32">sanctions over the Crimea crisis could</text>
  <text start="387.269" dur="6.47">leak to an asset freeze and what will</text>
  <text start="389.879" dur="6.36">also happen here and as Russia</text>
  <text start="393.739" dur="3.73">continually takes the money out they got</text>
  <text start="396.239" dur="5.55">to put it someplace and they&amp;#39;ll probably</text>
  <text start="397.469" dur="6.45">engage China for bilateral trade and</text>
  <text start="401.789" dur="4.08">ultimately transact using rubles or the</text>
  <text start="403.919" dur="3.54">renminbi and bypass the dollar</text>
  <text start="405.869" dur="2.27">completely in all these types of</text>
  <text start="407.459" dur="2.96">transaction</text>
  <text start="408.139" dur="3.631">and again the banks must be getting</text>
  <text start="410.419" dur="3.601">nervous because these companies have</text>
  <text start="411.77" dur="4.38">millions upon millions of dollars in</text>
  <text start="414.02" dur="6.299">these banks and as they&amp;#39;re pulling it</text>
  <text start="416.15" dur="6.509">out again the banks are not going to be</text>
  <text start="420.319" dur="4.921">able to survive this if the United</text>
  <text start="422.659" dur="4.921">States does impose sanctions on Russia</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="3.929">this is not going to turn out well for</text>
  <text start="427.58" dur="4.44">the US because we have to understand</text>
  <text start="429.169" dur="5.131">March 16th is the referendum on the</text>
  <text start="432.02" dur="5.07">Crimea and John Kerry and President</text>
  <text start="434.3" dur="5.13">Obama they both said if they go ahead</text>
  <text start="437.09" dur="5.22">and they go through with this they will</text>
  <text start="439.43" dur="5.97">impose sanctions and again China and</text>
  <text start="442.31" dur="4.919">Russia are warning the u.s. that this</text>
  <text start="445.4" dur="4.829">code this could come back to haunt them</text>
  <text start="447.229" dur="8.19">and they have to be very careful right</text>
  <text start="450.229" dur="7.5">now the u.s. tried to put in a draft</text>
  <text start="455.419" dur="5.43">resolution in the UN Security Council on</text>
  <text start="457.729" dur="5.9">the Ukraine Russia completely vetoed it</text>
  <text start="460.849" dur="5.761">so that went down the toilet China</text>
  <text start="463.629" dur="5.56">abstain from this and of course the US</text>
  <text start="466.61" dur="5.82">was out there saying that now Russia is</text>
  <text start="469.189" dur="6.061">isolated alone because they&amp;#39;re wrong but</text>
  <text start="472.43" dur="4.289">again as soon as Russia veto to it China</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="3.18">didn&amp;#39;t care at this time they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="476.719" dur="4.98">have to commit they didn&amp;#39;t have to do</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="6.359">anything the whole draft resolution was</text>
  <text start="481.699" dur="5.7">done so why get involved in in this and</text>
  <text start="484.789" dur="6.511">again China already stated that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.399" dur="7.38">backing Russia so this is a propaganda</text>
  <text start="491.3" dur="5.459">ploy that&amp;#39;s all that is now Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="494.779" dur="3.961">beefing up as we know their national</text>
  <text start="496.759" dur="5.19">guard and they&amp;#39;re ordering up around</text>
  <text start="498.74" dur="6.209">60,000 emergency forces to face the</text>
  <text start="501.949" dur="6.571">Russian invasion and again we have to</text>
  <text start="504.949" dur="6.421">remember that the 16,000 troops that are</text>
  <text start="508.52" dur="4.949">in Crimea they&amp;#39;re allowed to have up to</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="4.469">25,000 with Ukraine agreement they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513.469" dur="5.07">also having drills along the border of</text>
  <text start="515.839" dur="4.531">Ukraine of about 8,000 troops that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="518.539" dur="4.471">you see the tanks and all these things</text>
  <text start="520.37" dur="5.04">because they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing the</text>
  <text start="523.01" dur="5.37">West is doing they&amp;#39;re having drills in</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="5.94">the Black Sea they have a a wax plane up</text>
  <text start="528.38" dur="5.94">in the air both sides are flexing</text>
  <text start="531.35" dur="5.4">muscles both shot both sides are showing</text>
  <text start="534.32" dur="5.55">military might and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="5.04">doing it again one little thing one</text>
  <text start="539.87" dur="6.6">little false flag</text>
  <text start="541.79" dur="8.55">art this entire war often again the</text>
  <text start="546.47" dur="7.46">United States the central bankers along</text>
  <text start="550.34" dur="6.72">with the EU are all sitting there</text>
  <text start="553.93" dur="6.58">looking around and saying all we have is</text>
  <text start="557.06" dur="4.92">the west of Ukraine we want the south</text>
  <text start="560.51" dur="3.54">and the east even though they&amp;#39;re out in</text>
  <text start="561.98" dur="5.46">the news saying oh let them have it we</text>
  <text start="564.05" dur="6.06">don&amp;#39;t care baloney they want the entire</text>
  <text start="567.44" dur="4.86">country they want the Black Sea they</text>
  <text start="570.11" dur="4.11">want the strategic location because they</text>
  <text start="572.3" dur="3.51">want Ukraine on NATO and of course</text>
  <text start="574.22" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re going to put it on the EU they</text>
  <text start="575.81" dur="3.27">have their puppet government in place</text>
  <text start="577.28" dur="2.73">with no elections whatsoever because</text>
  <text start="579.08" dur="2.91">they don&amp;#39;t want to hold elections</text>
  <text start="580.01" dur="4.98">because they know these people would be</text>
  <text start="581.99" dur="5.31">voted out and again Putin is sitting</text>
  <text start="584.99" dur="6.57">there he&amp;#39;s sitting back waiting for them</text>
  <text start="587.3" dur="6.45">to do something now we understand and I</text>
  <text start="591.56" dur="5.19">talked about this quite a bit that</text>
  <text start="593.75" dur="4.65">sistah and we also have the UN arms</text>
  <text start="596.75" dur="3.33">treaty we have the gun bill it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="598.4" dur="3.96">pending in the Senate and I remember</text>
  <text start="600.08" dur="4.92">President Obama saying that if sis but</text>
  <text start="602.36" dur="5.64">came across my desk I completely veto it</text>
  <text start="605" dur="5.13">well it&amp;#39;s hard to believe because he</text>
  <text start="608" dur="5.37">created a frettin it through executive</text>
  <text start="610.13" dur="6.15">orders he created a framework that</text>
  <text start="613.37" dur="5.73">mimics sis but the only difference is</text>
  <text start="616.28" dur="4.38">that his framework is voluntary to the</text>
  <text start="619.1" dur="3.51">private corporations to hand over the</text>
  <text start="620.66" dur="3.93">private data to the government now</text>
  <text start="622.61" dur="3.93">what&amp;#39;s happening right now because he</text>
  <text start="624.59" dur="3.33">created all these executive orders you</text>
  <text start="626.54" dur="4.02">also created the executive orders</text>
  <text start="627.92" dur="5.15">actually to support sista but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="630.56" dur="5.4">lot of other legislation in being</text>
  <text start="633.07" dur="4.84">introduced that mimics sis but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="635.96" dur="4.11">pretty much the same thing where it will</text>
  <text start="637.91" dur="3.9">require every single company to hand</text>
  <text start="640.07" dur="5.1">over the private data and pretty much</text>

  <text start="734.72" dur="4.08">to do something there and of course</text>
  <text start="736.699" dur="4.471">there was because they wanted to look</text>
  <text start="738.8" dur="5.07">like something is happening in Iran</text>
