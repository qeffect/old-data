  <text start="106.7" dur="6.059">the economy is going to be doing and</text>
  <text start="108.969" dur="5.83">we&amp;#39;ve been noticing that all of these</text>
  <text start="112.759" dur="5.04">college graduates all the high school</text>
  <text start="114.799" dur="5.16">graduates they&amp;#39;re having a very</text>
  <text start="117.799" dur="5.13">difficult time finding full-time</text>
  <text start="119.959" dur="5.071">high-paying work and this causes a</text>
  <text start="122.929" dur="4.05">problem I mean we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="125.03" dur="4.259">thing happened throughout Europe where</text>
  <text start="126.979" dur="5.941">the youth unemployment is fifty sixty</text>
  <text start="129.289" dur="5.821">percent plus and the next generation is</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="4.83">not supporting the economy whatsoever</text>
  <text start="135.11" dur="4.65">and if they do not have the foundation</text>
  <text start="137.75" dur="3.93">there the economy is going to fall apart</text>
  <text start="139.76" dur="5.28">and we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing here in</text>
  <text start="141.68" dur="7.08">the United States most of the college</text>
  <text start="145.04" dur="6.72">graduates who are graduating they cannot</text>
  <text start="148.76" dur="5.46">find work and I&amp;#39;m not talking about the</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="5.28">part-time working i&amp;#39;m talking about jobs</text>
  <text start="154.22" dur="5.25">that are in their field making the pay</text>
  <text start="157.04" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re supposed to be making after</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="4.84">taking out you know tens of thousands or</text>
  <text start="162.35" dur="5.26">hundreds of thousands of dollars in</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="5.58">loans and we&amp;#39;re finding that a lot of</text>
  <text start="167.61" dur="5.61">these youths that are coming out of</text>
  <text start="169.89" dur="5.97">college they are living with their</text>
  <text start="173.22" dur="6.21">parents and if we go back to nineteen</text>
  <text start="175.86" dur="6.05">ninety nine a quarter of all 25 year</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="6.9">olds live with their parents by 2013</text>
  <text start="181.91" dur="6.07">this number doubled and currently half</text>
  <text start="186.33" dur="6.36">of young adults live in their parents</text>
  <text start="187.98" dur="8.729">home today fast forward to 2015 that</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="7.2">number is even worse and when we look we</text>
  <text start="196.709" dur="5.461">see that this is not just in one area I</text>
  <text start="199.89" dur="5.73">mean many of the states are reporting</text>
  <text start="202.17" dur="5.51">that children are living with their</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="8.369">parents but they&amp;#39;re no longer children</text>
  <text start="207.68" dur="7.99">they&amp;#39;re 22 23 24 25 and in states like</text>
  <text start="213.989" dur="3.151">Arkansas there&amp;#39;s thirty-seven percent</text>
  <text start="215.67" dur="4.55">still living at home illinois</text>

  <text start="220.22" dur="5.65">mississippi forty-four percent tennessee</text>
  <text start="222.989" dur="8.671">forty-four percent and it goes on and on</text>
  <text start="225.87" dur="7.35">and on and this is showing us that they</text>
  <text start="231.66" dur="2.669">are not getting those high pay jobs</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="4.739">where they can go out and rent an</text>
  <text start="234.329" dur="7.071">apartment get a car to get to work we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.959" dur="7.831">finding that most of these youths are</text>
  <text start="241.4" dur="8.53">being pushed down by the economic</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="5.819">factors of today now I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="4.17">people always hear from others saying</text>
  <text start="251.609" dur="4.861">listen well I have a job you should have</text>
  <text start="254.1" dur="5.509">a job you&amp;#39;re lazy you&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="7.89">looking for a job well let me just say</text>
  <text start="259.609" dur="7.961">those people who have a job thank God</text>
  <text start="264.36" dur="6.6">you do because you don&amp;#39;t want to be in</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="6.06">that circumstance where you&amp;#39;re laid off</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="5.07">and you&amp;#39;re looking for one because you</text>
  <text start="273.63" dur="6.02">will not realize how hard it is to find</text>
  <text start="276.03" dur="7.47">another job until you lose that job and</text>
  <text start="279.65" dur="7.45">I know a lot of people I&amp;#39;m one of them</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="6.56">who lost their job and it was a very</text>
  <text start="287.1" dur="5.4">very difficult time finding another job</text>
  <text start="290.06" dur="4.63">sometimes you can&amp;#39;t find that job</text>
  <text start="292.5" dur="3.599">sometimes you have to start something on</text>
  <text start="294.69" dur="2.97">your own because there&amp;#39;s just nothing</text>
  <text start="296.099" dur="4.081">out there</text>
  <text start="297.66" dur="6.24">and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of people fall</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="6.15">into this and it&amp;#39;s not just with finding</text>
  <text start="303.9" dur="4.23">a job it&amp;#39;s also trying to sell your home</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="4.32">people blame it on you you have them</text>
  <text start="308.13" dur="4.59">fixed up your house all this always</text>
  <text start="310.65" dur="5.19">seems to be turning back to the person</text>
  <text start="312.72" dur="6.93">but let me just tell you it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="6.2">person it&amp;#39;s the economic circumstance</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="6.39">it&amp;#39;s the economy that the central bank</text>
  <text start="322.04" dur="7.03">created it&amp;#39;s the illusion that everyone</text>
  <text start="326.04" dur="6.33">is living in today because let me just</text>
  <text start="329.07" dur="6.78">say those people who have been laid off</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="5.58">and there&amp;#39;s hundreds and hundreds of</text>
  <text start="335.85" dur="4.71">thousands of people in the last year</text>
  <text start="337.95" dur="6.51">that have been laid off they are having</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="5.7">a very difficult time finding work and</text>
  <text start="344.46" dur="3.75">people say well how do you know this</text>
  <text start="346.26" dur="3.42">well you have to look at the</text>
  <text start="348.21" dur="4.32">unemployment numbers they do tell us</text>
  <text start="349.68" dur="4.47">certain things now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="5.55">telling us that you know unemployment is</text>
  <text start="354.15" dur="6.84">very low and we know we don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="5.07">this because what they do is they take</text>
  <text start="360.99" dur="4.26">those people who can&amp;#39;t try and work and</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="5.25">they just don&amp;#39;t count them and if you</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="5.1">noticed that number continually</text>
  <text start="368.4" dur="5.88">increases where are these people coming</text>
  <text start="370.35" dur="5.55">from think about it these are the people</text>
  <text start="374.28" dur="3.93">that are being laid off these are the</text>
  <text start="375.9" dur="5.49">people that cannot find work at all now</text>
  <text start="378.21" dur="5.49">a lot of them do believe that if they</text>
  <text start="381.39" dur="4.94">hold out they will find that magical job</text>
  <text start="383.7" dur="7.41">with the pay they were making before and</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="8.11">what happens is time passes three months</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="5.9">six months nine months and they still</text>
  <text start="394.44" dur="5.9">can&amp;#39;t find that work that job and they</text>
  <text start="397.01" dur="6.159">become depressed they become upset and</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="4.86">some do stop looking they still want a</text>
  <text start="403.169" dur="5.221">job but they just give up and say I</text>
  <text start="405.2" dur="4.78">can&amp;#39;t find one what is going on here now</text>
  <text start="408.39" dur="5.49">some of them might go take a part-time</text>
  <text start="409.98" dur="6.51">job and other people are continually</text>
  <text start="413.88" dur="5.52">trying to find that magical job it just</text>
  <text start="416.49" dur="6.63">doesn&amp;#39;t exist out there and this is what</text>
  <text start="419.4" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re seeing today and it&amp;#39;s not your</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="3.33">fault because think about it you just</text>

  <text start="436.919" dur="6">that your fault it isn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s because</text>

  <text start="462.389" dur="3.721">are graduating cannot pay their student</text>
  <text start="464.219" dur="3.96">loans and this is why they modify the</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="5.189">student loans to go with what you are</text>
  <text start="468.179" dur="4.47">making your income so this way you can</text>
  <text start="471.299" dur="4.47">afford to pay just a little bit because</text>
  <text start="472.649" dur="5.43">you have to remember you can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="475.769" dur="5.841">bankrupt on alone and the taxpayers</text>
  <text start="478.079" dur="6.87">can&amp;#39;t bail out the student loan bubble</text>
  <text start="481.61" dur="6.369">now in the housing market we understand</text>

  <text start="506.519" dur="3.841">saying that they&amp;#39;ve leveled off and in</text>
  <text start="508.529" dur="3.99">certain places they dropped a little bit</text>
  <text start="510.36" dur="4.679">well let me tell you they dropped a lot</text>
  <text start="512.519" dur="4.56">more and we&amp;#39;re seeing mortgage</text>

  <text start="530.67" dur="5.909">looking to purchase a house they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="532.62" dur="6.569">kicked out of the market now a listener</text>
  <text start="536.579" dur="6.3">rode in I&amp;#39;m only gonna say his first</text>
  <text start="539.189" dur="7.83">name Joshua and he lives in long beach</text>
  <text start="542.879" dur="7.411">california and he&amp;#39;s been in the offshore</text>
  <text start="547.019" dur="6.93">oil for 13 years and he&amp;#39;s watched ships</text>
  <text start="550.29" dur="5.7">go by year after year usually the cargo</text>
  <text start="553.949" dur="5.51">ship starts stacking up in September</text>
  <text start="555.99" dur="8.039">most likely for the holiday season and</text>
  <text start="559.459" dur="6">what he&amp;#39;s seeing right now is that there</text>
  <text start="564.029" dur="5.341">are none</text>
  <text start="565.459" dur="12.011">they&amp;#39;re not stacking up the ports are</text>
  <text start="569.37" dur="12.42">not full and this tells us that the</text>
  <text start="577.47" dur="7.38">goods that people need or want they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581.79" dur="6.539">not purchasing them so there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="584.85" dur="5.15">to import this type of stuff and this is</text>
  <text start="588.329" dur="3.51">why we see the bowl to dry index</text>
  <text start="590" dur="3.93">continually falling and again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.839" dur="4.411">falling once again and now it&amp;#39;s down to</text>
  <text start="593.93" dur="5.11">737 and this is the raw material the</text>
  <text start="596.25" dur="4.529">factor is used to create goods so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="599.04" dur="5.789">starting to see this all over the place</text>
  <text start="600.779" dur="7.92">and to go with what&amp;#39;s happening at the</text>
  <text start="604.829" dur="6.781">ports we see that trucking which takes</text>
  <text start="608.699" dur="4.531">all the goods from the ports out to the</text>
  <text start="611.61" dur="4.11">different areas of stores and things</text>
  <text start="613.23" dur="5.28">like that warehouses the trucking</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="5.989">industry is starting to slow down the</text>
  <text start="618.51" dur="7.28">largest US truckload carrier Swift</text>
  <text start="621.709" dur="8.471">announced that revenues are declining</text>
  <text start="625.79" dur="6.489">now Swift blamed the disappearing fuel</text>
  <text start="630.18" dur="4.71">surcharge you know because fuel has gone</text>
  <text start="632.279" dur="6.711">down and they&amp;#39;re saying that well since</text>
  <text start="634.89" dur="6.629">we can&amp;#39;t push the fuel fuel surcharge</text>
  <text start="638.99" dur="7.39">this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing our revenues go</text>
  <text start="641.519" dur="8.791">down but it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense because</text>
  <text start="646.38" dur="9.199">they&amp;#39;re still charging the fuel charge</text>
  <text start="650.31" dur="8.37">the fuel surcharge so the question is</text>
  <text start="655.579" dur="5.711">what are they talking about so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="658.68" dur="5.94">still charging the fuel surcharge and</text>
  <text start="661.29" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re not seeing the</text>
  <text start="664.62" dur="4.949">revenue from it because what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="665.79" dur="6.63">happening is trucking is slowing down</text>
  <text start="669.569" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re not seeing the real revenue and</text>
  <text start="672.42" dur="4.62">this is what&amp;#39;s happening and I mention</text>
  <text start="674.399" dur="4.651">this about oil prices why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="677.04" dur="3.659">dropping so dramatically right now</text>
  <text start="679.05" dur="3.06">because most of these companies</text>
  <text start="680.699" dur="4.921">especially those that are delivering</text>
  <text start="682.11" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;ve kept their prices at the same</text>
  <text start="685.62" dur="4.5">level they didn&amp;#39;t drop it when fuel kite</text>
  <text start="687.87" dur="4.32">has come down if it and you can take a</text>
  <text start="690.12" dur="5.52">look at food they&amp;#39;ve come down tiny</text>
  <text start="692.19" dur="5.94">little bit but at this little level they</text>
