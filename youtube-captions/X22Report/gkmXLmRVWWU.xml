  <text start="35.73" dur="6.45">this is episode 1076 be and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="39.149" dur="5.011">is September 15 2016 and the title of</text>
  <text start="42.18" dur="4.76">the episode is the US government is</text>
  <text start="44.16" dur="5.789">prepared and ready it&amp;#39;s almost go time</text>
  <text start="46.94" dur="6.31">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="49.949" dur="5.661">political and geopolitical news now as</text>
  <text start="53.25" dur="4.8">the economy continually deteriorates</text>
  <text start="55.61" dur="3.699">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder for</text>
  <text start="58.05" dur="3.63">people to get health insurance of course</text>
  <text start="59.309" dur="6.781">Obama came out and told us it was going</text>
  <text start="61.68" dur="5.81">to be easier affordable well everything</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="3.51">that he said is completely opposite</text>
  <text start="67.49" dur="5.05">because the average cost of health</text>
  <text start="69.6" dur="7.199">coverage today offered by employers</text>
  <text start="72.54" dur="7.079">pushed above 18,000 for a family plan</text>
  <text start="76.799" dur="7.201">this year annual premium costs rose</text>
  <text start="79.619" dur="8.521">about 3% to 18,000 142 for an employee</text>
  <text start="84" dur="8.31">for employer family plan in 2016 from</text>
  <text start="88.14" dur="6.99">17,000 545 last year and we can see</text>
  <text start="92.31" dur="4.44">right now those individuals who go on to</text>
  <text start="95.13" dur="3.75">Obamacare those individuals who are</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="4.98">looking for a plan it is becoming very</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="5.04">very expensive and many people are</text>
  <text start="101.73" dur="4.679">opting to take the penalty because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="103.92" dur="7.35">much cheaper because they just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="106.409" dur="7.531">afford these high costs and you have to</text>
  <text start="111.27" dur="4.44">remember many people are losing work</text>
  <text start="113.94" dur="4.74">today many people have part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="7.769">they just don&amp;#39;t have the funds to pay</text>
  <text start="118.68" dur="7.41">for health insurance now very</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="7.59">interestingly the Government</text>
  <text start="126.09" dur="8.61">Accountability Office the GAO decided to</text>
  <text start="131.069" dur="7.67">look into Obamacare and they went</text>
  <text start="134.7" dur="7.11">undercover and what they found was that</text>
  <text start="138.739" dur="6.071">pretty much anyone who signs up for</text>
  <text start="141.81" dur="5.399">Obamacare they&amp;#39;ll receive a</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="4.86">taxpayer-funded incentives without</text>
  <text start="147.209" dur="6.471">having to worry about details like</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="5.45">proving citizenship identifying or</text>
  <text start="153.68" dur="3.79">[Music]</text>
  <text start="155.12" dur="6.88">showing people that you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="157.47" dur="6.96">low-income bracket in fact the study</text>
  <text start="162" dur="5.909">found that every single one of its 15</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="7.399">Tisha&amp;#39;s Obamacare applicants well they</text>
  <text start="167.909" dur="7.31">were actually approved for coverage</text>
  <text start="171.829" dur="9.901">despite intentional applications</text>
  <text start="175.219" dur="9.25">omissions they put in fictitious</text>
  <text start="181.73" dur="6.129">identification they gave fictitious</text>
  <text start="184.469" dur="6.33">citizenship documentation and all the</text>
  <text start="187.859" dur="7.05">applicants were approved for federal</text>
  <text start="190.799" dur="9.33">subsidies which totaled 60,000 per year</text>
  <text start="194.909" dur="8.791">so they had 15 fictitious fictitious</text>
  <text start="200.129" dur="6.36">applications the federal or state based</text>
  <text start="203.7" dur="4.709">marketplaces approved coverage at a time</text>
  <text start="206.489" dur="3.991">of application specifically 14</text>
  <text start="208.409" dur="4.741">applicants for qualified health plans</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="7.86">and one application for Medicaid each of</text>
  <text start="213.15" dur="8.039">the 14 for the health plans they were</text>
  <text start="218.34" dur="5.7">also approved for the apt c subsidies</text>
  <text start="221.189" dur="5.61">these subsidies total around 5,000 on</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="8.569">monthly basis or about 60,000 annually</text>
  <text start="226.799" dur="8.28">and when you look at the application</text>
  <text start="232.609" dur="4.99">they didn&amp;#39;t show that they were citizens</text>
  <text start="235.079" dur="5.91">they faked it or they put yes we were</text>
  <text start="237.599" dur="7.67">and they just made up these applications</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="8.131">everything was fake phony and false and</text>
  <text start="245.269" dur="8.951">we can see right now this system was</text>
  <text start="249.12" dur="7.829">designed to accept anybody into the</text>
  <text start="254.22" dur="7.52">system with no checks because they just</text>
  <text start="256.949" dur="7.771">want people on the system that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="261.74" dur="7.06">because the entire system was based on</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="5.939">the entire population being on Obamacare</text>
  <text start="268.8" dur="6.06">remember the health insurance companies</text>
  <text start="270.659" dur="7.051">created this bill and think about it</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="4.35">they SAT around in a room talking about</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="3.179">it saying listen we can do this but we</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="3.75">have to have the premiums hi we have to</text>
  <text start="280.889" dur="4.671">have everyone in this we need this</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="5.67">certain we need a certain number of</text>
  <text start="285.56" dur="7.03">applicants we need a certain number of</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="6.69">people paying in and if we don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="3.81">this it&amp;#39;s not going to work so the</text>
  <text start="295.32" dur="1.98">government said you know we can do we</text>
  <text start="296.4" dur="2.88">can put a penalty</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="4.92">this this will force people into it</text>
  <text start="299.28" dur="6.59">because they don&amp;#39;t want be penalized so</text>
  <text start="302.22" dur="7.199">they created this penalty and of course</text>
  <text start="305.87" dur="6.19">it&amp;#39;s completely unconstitutional but</text>
  <text start="309.419" dur="4.831">they kind of blackmailed the judge he</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="5.13">said it was constitutional then flew off</text>
  <text start="314.25" dur="7.08">for two weeks so no one questioned his</text>
  <text start="317.19" dur="9.36">decision but we can see right now their</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="7.619">plan it&amp;#39;s not going as planned so don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="4.35">worry they have a rider in there that</text>
  <text start="328.949" dur="4.59">allows the insurance companies that be</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="4.71">bailed out if things don&amp;#39;t go their way</text>
  <text start="333.539" dur="5.041">and of course the insurance companies</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="5.19">created that so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="338.58" dur="4.649">their entire plan was just to get</text>
  <text start="340.8" dur="4.769">everyone in there illegals it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="343.229" dur="6.06">matter just come on in you&amp;#39;ll get this</text>
  <text start="345.569" dur="7.291">they want everyone on the system that</text>
  <text start="349.289" dur="9.09">was the point of this now very</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="7.83">interestingly we know that Obama waiting</text>
  <text start="358.379" dur="4.65">for after the elections to create his</text>
  <text start="360.69" dur="5.58">executive order for illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="363.029" dur="5.61">allowing them to jump over the border</text>
  <text start="366.27" dur="3.54">once they&amp;#39;re in the United States they</text>
  <text start="368.639" dur="2.64">can stay in the United States and</text>
  <text start="369.81" dur="3.719">they&amp;#39;re shipped off to different cities</text>
  <text start="371.279" dur="4.621">and they keep saying there&amp;#39;s no way to</text>
  <text start="373.529" dur="5.61">control the border there&amp;#39;s no way we can</text>
  <text start="375.9" dur="5.73">do this well we know that Jay Johnson</text>
  <text start="379.139" dur="5.64">was out in Turkey who created a wall</text>
  <text start="381.63" dur="7.11">with surveillance to control the border</text>
  <text start="384.779" dur="7.26">and Mexico well they&amp;#39;re building a wall</text>
  <text start="388.74" dur="8.519">on its southern border to keep illegal</text>
  <text start="392.039" dur="8.701">immigrants out Mexico between Central</text>
  <text start="397.259" dur="6.141">America and Mexico but what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="400.74" dur="7.56">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="403.4" dur="8.919">the United States is sending 75 million</text>
  <text start="408.3" dur="7.229">in equipment and training to help with</text>
  <text start="412.319" dur="6.231">the building of the wall and for</text>
  <text start="415.529" dur="6.721">surveillance so the US taxpayers are</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="8.08">building the Mexican wall between Mexico</text>
  <text start="422.25" dur="6.529">and Central America but here in the</text>
  <text start="426.63" dur="4.44">United States as saying it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="428.779" dur="5.531">that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="431.07" dur="9.71">why would you want that but we&amp;#39;re paying</text>
  <text start="434.31" dur="10.8">for it in Mexico hmm that seems very</text>
  <text start="440.78" dur="8.74">hypocritical to me now Obama has come</text>
  <text start="445.11" dur="9.45">out and he is setting a timetable to</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="7.89">lift me and more sanctions and of course</text>
  <text start="454.56" dur="4.35">as we know he continually tells us that</text>
  <text start="457.41" dur="3.51">sanctions don&amp;#39;t work but he continually</text>
  <text start="458.91" dur="4.65">places sanctions in North Korea he</text>
  <text start="460.92" dur="6.81">placed some sanctions on Russia he</text>
  <text start="463.56" dur="6.21">places sanctions on Syria he continually</text>
  <text start="467.73" dur="3.66">does this and then on the other hand he</text>
  <text start="469.77" dur="3.06">tells us well we need to lift these</text>
  <text start="471.39" dur="5.85">sanctions because they really don&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="472.83" dur="6.84">what he&amp;#39;s really doing is he&amp;#39;s removing</text>
  <text start="477.24" dur="6.15">the sanctions where he needs to do</text>
  <text start="479.67" dur="9.06">business and what I mean by that if we</text>
  <text start="483.39" dur="11.13">look where me amar is it is near china</text>
  <text start="488.73" dur="8.49">and it completes the circle where they</text>
  <text start="494.52" dur="6.87">have each one of the countries</text>
  <text start="497.22" dur="8.76">surrounding china so we&amp;#39;ve had sanctions</text>
  <text start="501.39" dur="6.36">in this area for 20 years and obama said</text>
  <text start="505.98" dur="6.119">oh it&amp;#39;s all of a sudden it&amp;#39;s time for a</text>
  <text start="507.75" dur="11.419">change just like he did with Vietnam now</text>
  <text start="512.099" dur="11.641">right now the US will not trade in</text>
  <text start="519.169" dur="6.761">military equipment they can&amp;#39;t accept</text>
  <text start="523.74" dur="4.74">military equipment in this country it is</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="5.31">restricted right now how much do you</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="7.23">want to bet that this will be removed in</text>
  <text start="531.24" dur="7.2">the next couple of days or weeks just</text>
  <text start="535.71" dur="4.65">like they did with Vietnam and then all</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="8.61">of a sudden we&amp;#39;re going to see military</text>
  <text start="540.36" dur="9.33">assets moving into Myanmar that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="547.05" dur="4.41">exactly what is going to happen it</text>
  <text start="549.69" dur="3">happened in Vietnam because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="551.46" dur="2.33">trying to do is complete the circle</text>
  <text start="552.69" dur="3.33">because we know in the Philippines</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="6.46">they&amp;#39;re looking to get rid of the United</text>
  <text start="556.02" dur="7.35">States and they need to control that</text>
  <text start="560.25" dur="4.53">region now out in the Persian Gulf we</text>
  <text start="563.37" dur="4.05">see things are heating up</text>
  <text start="564.78" dur="5.22">that area the u.s. is continually</text>
  <text start="567.42" dur="5.25">whining that Iran is racing their ships</text>
  <text start="570" dur="6.69">their planes and really think about it</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="6.3">the u.s. is in their territory the u.s.</text>
  <text start="576.69" dur="7.2">is selling their ships or flying their</text>
  <text start="578.97" dur="7.08">planes near their borders and yes</text>
  <text start="583.89" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re going to be sending boats out</text>
  <text start="586.05" dur="6.45">there going to be sending out planes to</text>
  <text start="588.48" dur="6.6">inspect what&amp;#39;s going on if Iran was in</text>
  <text start="592.5" dur="6.45">the Gulf of Mexico or if the coast of</text>
  <text start="595.08" dur="5.64">New York doing the same thing the United</text>
  <text start="598.95" dur="4.89">States would do the same thing so really</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="6.17">who&amp;#39;s harassing who because it seems</text>
  <text start="603.84" dur="6.51">that the u.s. is harassing Iran</text>
  <text start="606.89" dur="5.65">provoking Iran and right now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="4.86">seeing is that the u.s. is going to be</text>
  <text start="612.54" dur="5.85">deploying drones in the Persian Gulf to</text>
  <text start="615.21" dur="4.95">keep an eye on Iran and we can see that</text>
  <text start="618.39" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re going to be creating new</text>
  <text start="620.16" dur="7.65">facilities for the Navy&amp;#39;s mq-4c Triton</text>
  <text start="625.02" dur="6.69">drones and this is going to be stationed</text>
  <text start="627.81" dur="6.69">at al dhafra airbase in the United Arab</text>
  <text start="631.71" dur="5.1">Emirates now these new drones the MQ</text>
  <text start="634.5" dur="4.71">fours they can fly 80 200 miles without</text>
  <text start="636.81" dur="5.34">needing to refuel they can fly at</text>
  <text start="639.21" dur="6.18">altitudes of about 60,000 feet and they</text>
  <text start="642.15" dur="5.7">can fly at a maximum speed of about 360</text>
  <text start="645.39" dur="4.97">miles per hour and these drones can</text>
  <text start="647.85" dur="6.45">spend up to about 30 hours in the year</text>
  <text start="650.36" dur="7.06">in the 30 hours in the air on every</text>
  <text start="654.3" dur="7.35">mission they all have powerful cameras</text>
  <text start="657.42" dur="7.59">radars they can track ships and they can</text>
  <text start="661.65" dur="6.33">also track land targets so we can see</text>
  <text start="665.01" dur="5.22">already the United States is preparing</text>
  <text start="667.98" dur="5.61">moving more military assets into this</text>
  <text start="670.23" dur="6.33">region to start something else remember</text>
  <text start="673.59" dur="7.16">the entire goal here was to get into</text>
  <text start="676.56" dur="8.1">Syria of course Libya Yemen Lebanon Iraq</text>
  <text start="680.75" dur="6.61">Sudan get into Syria then move into Iran</text>
  <text start="684.66" dur="5.76">and it&amp;#39;s starting to seem it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="687.36" dur="5.91">to look like that they&amp;#39;re moving in that</text>
  <text start="690.42" dur="5.43">direction we see the United States</text>
  <text start="693.27" dur="4.2">signed the largest ever military a deal</text>
  <text start="695.85" dur="4.68">with Israel</text>
  <text start="697.47" dur="4.83">and all of a sudden the u.s. put out a</text>
  <text start="700.53" dur="4.38">travel advisory for the Golan Heights in</text>
  <text start="702.3" dur="6.6">Israel so it looks like something is</text>
  <text start="704.91" dur="7.1">about to happen in that region we see</text>
  <text start="708.9" dur="6.63">the Syrian army they are withdrawing</text>
  <text start="712.01" dur="5.98">from the Aleppo area they&amp;#39;re creating a</text>
  <text start="715.53" dur="5.4">demilitarized zone to bring in</text>
  <text start="717.99" dur="4.53">humanitarian aid have a corridor so they</text>
  <text start="720.93" dur="4.62">can bring in all of this so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="722.52" dur="5.85">removing their artillery we see turkey</text>
  <text start="725.55" dur="5.9">right now turkey is preparing for a</text>
  <text start="728.37" dur="6.26">third phase of an Aleppo offensive and</text>
  <text start="731.45" dur="5.83">we can see what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="734.63" dur="5.02">creating a buffer zone they&amp;#39;re clearing</text>
  <text start="737.28" dur="3.63">out the area they don&amp;#39;t need the Islamic</text>
  <text start="739.65" dur="3.63">state right now they&amp;#39;re cleaning up</text>
  <text start="740.91" dur="4.86">after them getting rid of any type of</text>
  <text start="743.28" dur="4.53">evidence whatsoever we know we have US</text>
  <text start="745.77" dur="6.51">troops in there the French have troops</text>
  <text start="747.81" dur="7.53">in there we see right now that turkey is</text>
  <text start="752.28" dur="8.37">in there cleaning up and clearing the</text>
  <text start="755.34" dur="8.34">area and creating these zones and all of</text>
  <text start="760.65" dur="5.18">this is going to be used for the major</text>
  <text start="763.68" dur="5.55">assault that they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="765.83" dur="6.58">coming up very soon because this is all</text>
  <text start="769.23" dur="7.05">the United States has left because this</text>
  <text start="772.41" dur="6.24">ceasefire deal well it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like</text>
  <text start="776.28" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s going too well because Russia right</text>
  <text start="778.65" dur="3.9">now has accused the United States of</text>
  <text start="780.09" dur="4.29">failing to fulfill its obligation under</text>
  <text start="782.55" dur="4.82">the truce agreement they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="784.38" dur="6.33">the Syrian forces the Russian forces</text>
  <text start="787.37" dur="5.77">they stopped firing but the moderate</text>
  <text start="790.71" dur="5.22">rebel groups the terrorist groups they</text>
  <text start="793.14" dur="5.73">haven&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re continually fighting</text>
  <text start="795.93" dur="5.01">they have not stopped and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="798.87" dur="5.22">interesting is that we know the United</text>
  <text start="800.94" dur="5.34">States wanted to keep this ceasefire p</text>
  <text start="804.09" dur="5.97">steal a secret because they&amp;#39;re sensitive</text>
  <text start="806.28" dur="5.6">data inside well Russia is saying you</text>
  <text start="810.06" dur="6.57">know something it&amp;#39;d be better if we</text>
  <text start="811.88" dur="8.11">published the entire ceasefire documents</text>
  <text start="816.63" dur="5.94">this way there&amp;#39;ll be no question of what</text>
  <text start="819.99" dur="4.56">was agreed upon now of course the United</text>
  <text start="822.57" dur="4.71">States doesn&amp;#39;t want this to happen but</text>
  <text start="824.55" dur="4.8">France is out there they are saying that</text>
  <text start="827.28" dur="3.63">they should receive the text of the</text>
  <text start="829.35" dur="3.06">ceasefire deal so</text>
  <text start="830.91" dur="4.83">they understand what the deal is about</text>
  <text start="832.41" dur="7.23">and that there&amp;#39;s no confusion as to who</text>
  <text start="835.74" dur="7.17">was who&amp;#39;s of who&amp;#39;s to be targeted on the</text>
  <text start="839.64" dur="5.13">ground so it looks like the United</text>
  <text start="842.91" dur="2.82">States once again and I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="844.77" dur="2.64">about the people of the United States</text>
  <text start="845.73" dur="6.93">I&amp;#39;m talking about the government who</text>
  <text start="847.41" dur="8.25">wants war who wants to push war to keep</text>
  <text start="852.66" dur="7.53">their system going to keep their way of</text>
  <text start="855.66" dur="7.68">life moving forward and all of this is</text>
  <text start="860.19" dur="4.91">for complete and total control now</text>
  <text start="863.34" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re backed into a corner once again</text>
  <text start="865.1" dur="4.51">because now Russia and the coalition</text>
  <text start="868.14" dur="3.75">forces are saying you know something we</text>
  <text start="869.61" dur="4.38">should have this document why don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="871.89" dur="4.29">have it and we know the United States</text>
  <text start="873.99" dur="4.02">doesn&amp;#39;t want to produce this because</text>
  <text start="876.18" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s information in there they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="878.01" dur="5.76">want let out and this is going to pose a</text>
  <text start="880.86" dur="5.73">problem we&amp;#39;re already seeing the</text>
  <text start="883.77" dur="5.04">Pentagon out there saying that no Russia</text>
  <text start="886.59" dur="4.14">and the US we did not discuss joint</text>
  <text start="888.81" dur="4.11">military operations in Syria whatsoever</text>
  <text start="890.73" dur="8.43">whatever John Kerry said is completely</text>
  <text start="892.92" dur="8.67">wrong and we know that the neocons they</text>
  <text start="899.16" dur="5.76">don&amp;#39;t want to work with Russia they want</text>
  <text start="901.59" dur="8.13">Russia out of Syria they want Assad out</text>
  <text start="904.92" dur="7.44">of Syria they want Syria then they want</text>
  <text start="909.72" dur="6.96">to go into Iran and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="912.36" dur="6.57">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of confusion around</text>
  <text start="916.68" dur="4.62">this ceasefire and they should publish</text>
  <text start="918.93" dur="6.03">this document so everyone is clear on</text>
  <text start="921.3" dur="6.54">the terms we see the US military right</text>
  <text start="924.96" dur="6.54">now they&amp;#39;re shifting surveillance</text>
  <text start="927.84" dur="5.61">aircraft military assets from all other</text>
  <text start="931.5" dur="6.12">different regions around the world and</text>
  <text start="933.45" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re bringing it into Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="937.62" dur="3.86">going to increase the number of</text>
  <text start="938.7" dur="6.23">intelligence analysts in Syria and</text>
  <text start="941.48" dur="8.44">they&amp;#39;re doing this so they can identify</text>
  <text start="944.93" dur="9.13">and approve different air strikes in</text>
  <text start="949.92" dur="6.69">Syria so what I see happening here is</text>
  <text start="954.06" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re bringing all of this in for</text>
  <text start="956.61" dur="4.62">whatever offensive they&amp;#39;re planning here</text>
  <text start="958.83" dur="5.58">because we know that the ceasefire is a</text>
  <text start="961.23" dur="5.609">stall tactic we know that turkey</text>
  <text start="964.41" dur="4.59">is clearing out a puffer zone we know</text>
  <text start="966.839" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re going to use this zone to launch</text>
  <text start="969" dur="5.73">the attack this has been in the planning</text>
  <text start="971.49" dur="5.789">stages for a very long time the</text>
  <text start="974.73" dur="5.339">Brookings Institute plan this out and</text>
  <text start="977.279" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re following it to the tee I mean</text>
  <text start="980.069" dur="4.5">they might have had a take other roads</text>
  <text start="982.019" dur="5.3">to get there and curve around and get to</text>
  <text start="984.569" dur="5.101">this point but they&amp;#39;re following it</text>
  <text start="987.319" dur="5.051">which means they&amp;#39;re going to be building</text>
  <text start="989.67" dur="4.26">up the military forces in this area they</text>
  <text start="992.37" dur="3.719">already have two bases the French has a</text>
  <text start="993.93" dur="3.269">base that they built in Syria without</text>
  <text start="996.089" dur="5.19">the permission of the Syrian government</text>
  <text start="997.199" dur="6.361">and they&amp;#39;re going to use this to launch</text>
  <text start="1001.279" dur="4.141">a major offensive when the time is right</text>
  <text start="1003.56" dur="7.35">and it looks like we are approaching</text>
  <text start="1005.42" dur="7.109">that time we see out in Germany they are</text>
  <text start="1010.91" dur="4.529">worried about lone wolf terrorist</text>
  <text start="1012.529" dur="5.011">attacks in Europe that are ordered and</text>
  <text start="1015.439" dur="6.421">orchestrated through social media like</text>
  <text start="1017.54" dur="5.76">Facebook whatsapp and the reason why</text>
  <text start="1021.86" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re saying this is they want control</text>
  <text start="1023.3" dur="6.749">of these apps they want control of these</text>
  <text start="1027.11" dur="4.17">social media platforms because what</text>
  <text start="1030.049" dur="2.731">they&amp;#39;re saying really doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="1031.28" dur="4.379">sense they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1032.78" dur="5.97">sending encrypted messages through these</text>
  <text start="1035.659" dur="5.55">systems and they are getting prepared</text>
  <text start="1038.75" dur="3.87">and ready to plan attacks in Germany</text>
  <text start="1041.209" dur="4.2">well if they&amp;#39;re encrypted how are they</text>
  <text start="1042.62" dur="4.85">reading it how do they know and let me</text>
  <text start="1045.409" dur="6.031">just say if these terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="1047.47" dur="5.579">really wanted to do something they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1051.44" dur="3.78">not going to go through social media</text>
  <text start="1053.049" dur="2.951">they&amp;#39;re going to create other methods</text>
  <text start="1055.22" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re going to create your own</text>
  <text start="1056" dur="7.23">encryption again this is a way to</text>
  <text start="1059.15" dur="7.08">control what people are saying doing in</text>
  <text start="1063.23" dur="5.22">a country and we know that these</text>
  <text start="1066.23" dur="5.4">terrorist attacks this is all an inside</text>
  <text start="1068.45" dur="6.87">job I mean think about it the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1071.63" dur="6.179">state they&amp;#39;re pretty much gone I mean</text>
  <text start="1075.32" dur="5.489">they were a strong force when they were</text>
  <text start="1077.809" dur="8.821">operational in Syria in Iraq but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1080.809" dur="9.331">losing land like crazy they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1086.63" dur="6">not many of them left compared to what</text>
  <text start="1090.14" dur="4.71">they were like before so this whole</text>
  <text start="1092.63" dur="4.32">thing about attacking from these lone</text>
  <text start="1094.85" dur="3.39">wolves about being radicalized that</text>
  <text start="1096.95" dur="5.13">story is falling</text>
  <text start="1098.24" dur="7.86">art but they&amp;#39;re trying to use it to</text>
  <text start="1102.08" dur="7.49">scare people to give up their right to</text>
  <text start="1106.1" dur="6.36">use encryption their right to privacy</text>
  <text start="1109.57" dur="7.45">their right to talk to people over the</text>
  <text start="1112.46" dur="7.65">internet without being spied on and all</text>
  <text start="1117.02" dur="6.27">of this is playing into one thing and</text>
  <text start="1120.11" dur="6.83">one thing only and that is the collapse</text>
  <text start="1123.29" dur="8.43">of the system control of the people</text>
  <text start="1126.94" dur="8.35">moving us to a war because like I said</text>
  <text start="1131.72" dur="5.1">we can see the writing is on the wall we</text>
  <text start="1135.29" dur="5.54">can see that all these indicators</text>
  <text start="1136.82" dur="6.54">economic indicators political indicators</text>
  <text start="1140.83" dur="7.65">geopolitical indicators they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1143.36" dur="8.03">coming together right now and things are</text>
  <text start="1148.48" dur="5.68">starting to heat up around the world</text>
  <text start="1151.39" dur="7.51">countries are taking sides the</text>
  <text start="1154.16" dur="9.75">Philippines they&amp;#39;re taking aside we see</text>
  <text start="1158.9" dur="8.58">Russia China they&amp;#39;re on one side North</text>
  <text start="1163.91" dur="6.81">Korea on another side and the coalition</text>
  <text start="1167.48" dur="7.91">forces they will be taking sides</text>
  <text start="1170.72" dur="7.62">eventually of where they want to be and</text>
  <text start="1175.39" dur="5.23">we can see right now that this is a</text>
  <text start="1178.34" dur="4.469">tough spot for the United States</text>
  <text start="1180.62" dur="4.98">government central bankers because they</text>
  <text start="1182.809" dur="5.671">want this war because the dollar reserve</text>
  <text start="1185.6" dur="6.3">system the petro dollar it&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="1188.48" dur="6.99">apart things are rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="1191.9" dur="7.08">very quickly and we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1195.47" dur="6.12">preparing for this collapse and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1198.98" dur="6.12">getting ready to go to make their move</text>
  <text start="1201.59" dur="5.67">and I think the time frame for them</text>
  <text start="1205.1" dur="4.32">doing this is getting smaller and</text>
  <text start="1207.26" dur="3.72">smaller and smaller and eventually</text>
  <text start="1209.42" dur="6.389">they&amp;#39;re going to get the green light to</text>
  <text start="1210.98" dur="8.75">go and once they go things are really</text>
  <text start="1215.809" dur="7.5">going to accelerate we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1219.73" dur="6.31">horrific things people are not going to</text>
  <text start="1223.309" dur="4.231">know what&amp;#39;s happening especially when</text>
  <text start="1226.04" dur="5.39">we&amp;#39;re in the first phase of the collapse</text>
  <text start="1227.54" dur="6.59">think about back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="1231.43" dur="4.89">when things started to fall apart how</text>
  <text start="1234.13" dur="2.88">people were losing their jobs people</text>
  <text start="1236.32" dur="2.19">didn&amp;#39;t know how they were going to</text>
  <text start="1237.01" dur="3.99">survive it I remember the stories on the</text>
  <text start="1238.51" dur="4.38">on the TV where they showed people</text>
  <text start="1241" dur="3.09">living in their houses because they</text>
  <text start="1242.89" dur="2.43">didn&amp;#39;t want to leave they couldn&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="1244.09" dur="3.33">for their electric they stayed in their</text>
  <text start="1245.32" dur="3.66">houses candles were lit all around their</text>
  <text start="1247.42" dur="5.07">house they didn&amp;#39;t have the money to pay</text>
  <text start="1248.98" dur="4.77">for food electric heat air conditioning</text>
  <text start="1252.49" dur="4.26">but they didn&amp;#39;t want to leave their</text>
  <text start="1253.75" dur="4.86">homes and on the other hand they had</text>
  <text start="1256.75" dur="3.21">people in California saying you know</text>
  <text start="1258.61" dur="2.94">something we&amp;#39;re out of here they left</text>
  <text start="1259.96" dur="5.15">all their furniture they left all their</text>
  <text start="1261.55" dur="7.77">belongings and they just left the homes</text>
  <text start="1265.11" dur="6.25">so when this hits this time this</text>
  <text start="1269.32" dur="6.27">situation is going to be much much worse</text>
  <text start="1271.36" dur="8.15">and we&amp;#39;re going to see during the first</text>
  <text start="1275.59" dur="9.09">phase capital controls credit freeze up</text>
  <text start="1279.51" dur="8.83">bail-ins we&amp;#39;re going to see deliveries</text>

  <text start="1292.81" dur="5.16">very nervous and this is why everyone</text>
  <text start="1296.35" dur="7.91">needs to be prepared and ready for this</text>
