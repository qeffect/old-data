  <text start="41.379" dur="5.671">episode is warning something major is</text>
  <text start="44.199" dur="5.911">about to happen in the Middle East let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.05" dur="6.24">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="50.11" dur="4.379">and geopolitical news now we see the</text>
  <text start="53.29" dur="3.75">battle between</text>
  <text start="54.489" dur="6">the US government FBI and Apple it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="57.04" dur="5.909">continuing we know that the FBI US</text>
  <text start="60.489" dur="5.431">government they want complete access</text>
  <text start="62.949" dur="6.121">they want some type of portal backdoor</text>
  <text start="65.92" dur="5.129">into apples products so they can spy on</text>
  <text start="69.07" dur="3.9">the people of course they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.049" dur="6.301">just the one phone but by the way the</text>
  <text start="72.97" dur="6.329">phone that they&amp;#39;re talking about is the</text>
  <text start="77.35" dur="3.48">phone from his business it&amp;#39;s not his</text>
  <text start="79.299" dur="3.811">personal phone that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="80.83" dur="4.399">get into this is the phone where the FBI</text>
  <text start="83.11" dur="4.32">told his employer hey you know what</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="4.991">changed the password and this locked</text>
  <text start="87.43" dur="6.21">them out of the iCloud now was that done</text>
  <text start="90.22" dur="6">on purpose most likely because they are</text>
  <text start="93.64" dur="5.51">trying to push an agenda but there was a</text>
  <text start="96.22" dur="6">survey done and 55 percent of Americans</text>
  <text start="99.15" dur="7.99">think the government would use the</text>
  <text start="102.22" dur="8.1">ability to unlock phones if they got</text>
  <text start="107.14" dur="6.14">access and they think that the US</text>
  <text start="110.32" dur="6.089">government FBI should not have access</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="6.22">under any circumstances because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="116.409" dur="5.761">afraid eventually they will use this to</text>
  <text start="119.5" dur="4.56">spy on the American people and I</text>
  <text start="122.17" dur="5.94">completely agree with this this is</text>
  <text start="124.06" dur="7.739">exactly what they would be doing now an</text>
  <text start="128.11" dur="10.5">interesting story came up where there</text>
  <text start="131.799" dur="11.241">was this person named Tyson who was in</text>
  <text start="138.61" dur="7.409">Camarillo he went to a board meeting and</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="6.64">he said he lived there he was a resident</text>
  <text start="146.019" dur="8.19">and it turned out that he was an actor</text>
  <text start="149.68" dur="8.809">from Beverly Hills and he was sent there</text>
  <text start="154.209" dur="4.28">and it was for this construction project</text>
  <text start="159.48" dur="6.77">to Bay</text>
  <text start="161.18" dur="11.279">ethically criticize what was going on</text>
  <text start="166.25" dur="9.269">there he was handed a script and he was</text>
  <text start="172.459" dur="7.14">put into this position and the</text>
  <text start="175.519" dur="7.14">organization that hires these people is</text>
  <text start="179.599" dur="5.911">called crowds on demand now we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="182.659" dur="4.95">this a lot with crisis actors for</text>
  <text start="185.51" dur="4.199">different events where they put it out</text>
  <text start="187.609" dur="6">and there&amp;#39;s groups that have these</text>
  <text start="189.709" dur="7.261">actors ready to go and by the way this</text>
  <text start="193.609" dur="7.46">crisis this crowds on demand there is</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="9.03">about 20,000 actors that are subscribed</text>
  <text start="201.069" dur="8.23">who belong to this organization which</text>
  <text start="206" dur="7.829">they use on local level on the state</text>
  <text start="209.299" dur="7.86">level and there are many other types of</text>
  <text start="213.829" dur="8.49">these type of these companies all around</text>
  <text start="217.159" dur="7.53">the US and what this guy said Tyson is</text>
  <text start="222.319" dur="6.03">that they hired me we have to sign a</text>
  <text start="224.689" dur="7.501">nondisclosure agreement and Adam Swart</text>
  <text start="228.349" dur="8.45">the CEO of the company basically wrote</text>
  <text start="232.19" dur="9.24">the scripted lines for him and basically</text>
  <text start="236.799" dur="6.97">he&amp;#39;s was being used to sway city</text>
  <text start="241.43" dur="4.699">officials in meetings across the country</text>
  <text start="243.769" dur="5.761">all these actors this is what they do</text>
  <text start="246.129" dur="8.29">depending on who hires them now state</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="9.679">officials politicians for their</text>
  <text start="254.419" dur="4.79">campaigns they do hire these people and</text>
  <text start="259.599" dur="4.75">it&amp;#39;s not illegal to do so it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="263.24" dur="3.899">against the law</text>
  <text start="264.349" dur="6.361">but I think people should be told up</text>
  <text start="267.139" dur="5.46">front that this person is an actor it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.71" dur="4.53">not someone who cares about the issues</text>
  <text start="272.599" dur="6.781">and they&amp;#39;re put into place for a</text>
  <text start="275.24" dur="6.72">one-sided argument so is this a little</text>
  <text start="279.38" dur="5.7">misleading and not transparent all yes</text>
  <text start="281.96" dur="6.78">and we see that this same type of thing</text>
  <text start="285.08" dur="6.649">goes on in the false flag events where</text>
  <text start="288.74" dur="5.82">they hire crisis actors to come on in</text>
  <text start="291.729" dur="5.081">play the part and then</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="4.92">spread all over the TV and the news and</text>
  <text start="296.81" dur="6.9">we saw it in Sandy Hook we saw it in the</text>
  <text start="299.48" dur="7.53">Boston bombing and were made to believe</text>
  <text start="303.71" dur="8.04">that these people are real when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.01" dur="9.99">really not now the US government the US</text>
  <text start="311.75" dur="10.23">military they funded a study and they</text>
  <text start="317" dur="8.31">are ready to go with a new system where</text>
  <text start="321.98" dur="5.249">they hook into Twitter and they can</text>
  <text start="325.31" dur="5.37">predict whether you&amp;#39;re going to join a</text>
  <text start="327.229" dur="6.361">protest movin movement just by looking</text>
  <text start="330.68" dur="4.44">at your tweets a study carried out by</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="7.11">researchers at Arizona State University</text>
  <text start="335.12" dur="7.62">Texas and Yahoo funded in part by the US</text>
  <text start="340.7" dur="6.15">military office of naval research looked</text>
  <text start="342.74" dur="6.35">at 2686 Twitter posts to create a system</text>
  <text start="346.85" dur="5.49">that will reliably spot future online</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="8.02">protesters but what&amp;#39;s more worrying</text>
  <text start="352.34" dur="6.92">about this is this algorithm would give</text>
  <text start="357.11" dur="5.429">governments an upper leg over political</text>
  <text start="359.26" dur="6.73">dissidents they do not like and we</text>
  <text start="362.539" dur="7.231">discuss this many times before the</text>
  <text start="365.99" dur="9.09">government the people in power are more</text>
  <text start="369.77" dur="9.57">afraid of you you you me than anything</text>
  <text start="375.08" dur="9.089">else because the people millions of</text>
  <text start="379.34" dur="7.41">people who are in rooms talking about</text>
  <text start="384.169" dur="4.491">how they dislike the government how the</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="5.37">government is not working for the people</text>
  <text start="388.66" dur="6.4">putting together organizations they</text>
  <text start="392.12" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t want this to happen that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="395.06" dur="4.169">they don&amp;#39;t want you to have encryption</text>
  <text start="396.26" dur="4.469">encryption is almost like back in the</text>
  <text start="399.229" dur="4.921">day when the founding fathers were</text>
  <text start="400.729" dur="5.551">gathering in a pub or a small meeting</text>
  <text start="404.15" dur="5.13">area where the government didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="6.63">about it and they talked about creating</text>
  <text start="409.28" dur="5.759">a new nation well with encryption you</text>
  <text start="412.91" dur="3.78">can do this over thousands of miles</text>
  <text start="415.039" dur="5.94">where you can have people talk in</text>
  <text start="416.69" dur="6.81">private where the government can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="420.979" dur="4.471">figure out what you&amp;#39;re saying and this</text>
  <text start="423.5" dur="4.229">is what they don&amp;#39;t like this is why</text>
  <text start="425.45" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re using social media and all these</text>
  <text start="427.729" dur="4.351">algorithms</text>
  <text start="428.48" dur="6.33">to figure out who&amp;#39;s doing what who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.08" dur="4.8">talking to who which groups they need to</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="2.55">look at because they&amp;#39;re very nervous</text>
  <text start="436.88" dur="5.97">about this</text>
  <text start="437.36" dur="8.52">then add weapons into the picture this</text>
  <text start="442.85" dur="4.41">is a scary scenario for them this is</text>
  <text start="445.88" dur="4.74">what they&amp;#39;re worried about this is why</text>
  <text start="447.26" dur="5.93">they&amp;#39;re trying to disarm the people this</text>
  <text start="450.62" dur="5.19">is why they&amp;#39;re spying on the people</text>
  <text start="453.19" dur="5.8">because they want full control they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="5.4">never going to just say okay I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="458.99" dur="4.74">stepping down sorry I wasn&amp;#39;t working for</text>
  <text start="461.21" dur="4.98">the people no they&amp;#39;re gonna try to hold</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="6.98">on to their power they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="466.19" dur="7.02">to stop those people who believe that</text>
  <text start="470.71" dur="3.91">they&amp;#39;re corrupt those people that</text>
  <text start="473.21" dur="2.76">believe that we should remove the</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="2.43">government those people that believe</text>
  <text start="475.97" dur="3.3">that we should have a different</text>
  <text start="477.05" dur="3.21">government those police those people</text>
  <text start="479.27" dur="3.21">that believe the government is not</text>
  <text start="480.26" dur="4.98">working for the people this is what they</text>
  <text start="482.48" dur="6">are trying to stop they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="4.8">stop all of those people who believe</text>
  <text start="488.48" dur="4.32">this this is why you hear domestic</text>
  <text start="490.04" dur="5.76">terrorism this is why you hear extremist</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="4.86">groups this is why they&amp;#39;re coming out</text>
  <text start="495.8" dur="3.81">with all these things because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="497.66" dur="5.79">trying to get a handle and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="499.61" dur="5.43">trying to spy on everyone to understand</text>
  <text start="503.45" dur="4.98">what everyone is thinking what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.04" dur="7.05">talking about and who they need to look</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="6.6">at and keep an eye on and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="512.09" dur="5.94">interesting is that Amnesty</text>
  <text start="515.03" dur="7.35">International has put out a report</text>
  <text start="518.03" dur="6.93">saying that war crimes and other</text>
  <text start="522.38" dur="4.89">violations of the laws of war were</text>
  <text start="524.96" dur="6.12">committed in almost 20 countries in the</text>
  <text start="527.27" dur="8.34">past year including Burundi Israel and</text>
  <text start="531.08" dur="9.83">many other countries many governments</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="7.71">are also unlawfully targeting activists</text>
  <text start="540.91" dur="5.35">legal workers and other human rights</text>
  <text start="543.32" dur="6.42">defenders partly due to rising global</text>
  <text start="546.26" dur="4.71">security threats instead of recognizing</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="3.03">the crucial role these people play in</text>
  <text start="550.97" dur="4.53">society many governments guess what</text>
  <text start="552.77" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re deliberately</text>
  <text start="555.5" dur="5.57">setting out to strangle criticism in</text>
  <text start="558.32" dur="2.75">their country</text>
  <text start="561.79" dur="5.76">so they&amp;#39;ve broken their own laws in</text>
  <text start="564.33" dur="4.69">their crackdowns against citizens and</text>
  <text start="567.55" dur="3.48">this is coming from the Amnesty</text>
  <text start="569.02" dur="4.17">International report saying that</text>
  <text start="571.03" dur="5.1">governments they don&amp;#39;t want these people</text>
  <text start="573.19" dur="6.87">speaking out and they&amp;#39;re deliberately</text>
  <text start="576.13" dur="8.34">shutting them up and this is happening</text>
  <text start="580.06" dur="6.63">in 20 different countries and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="584.47" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s happening in many many more it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.69" dur="4.56">happening here right in the United</text>
  <text start="588.07" dur="4.62">States it&amp;#39;s happening in Canada it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.25" dur="4.68">happening throughout Europe and</text>
  <text start="592.69" dur="6.8">Australia now</text>
  <text start="595.93" dur="3.56">think about this for a second a</text>
  <text start="599.52" dur="5.83">population where the government can</text>
  <text start="602.26" dur="5.91">crack down on people because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="605.35" dur="4.71">like what they&amp;#39;re saying that does not</text>
  <text start="608.17" dur="6.83">have weapons to defend their freedom of</text>
  <text start="610.06" dur="7.62">speech that is a controlled population</text>
  <text start="615" dur="5.32">that is a population where the</text>
  <text start="617.68" dur="4.7">government can make them do whatever</text>
  <text start="620.32" dur="6.87">they want they can throw them in prison</text>
  <text start="622.38" dur="9.55">they can kill them but a population that</text>
  <text start="627.19" dur="6.81">has a weapon in their hands can say no</text>
  <text start="631.93" dur="6.42">you cannot do this</text>
  <text start="634" dur="9.26">we are a force and we will not go</text>
  <text start="638.35" dur="7.17">quietly you&amp;#39;ll have to listen to us and</text>
  <text start="643.26" dur="3.4">this is what the founding fathers were</text>
  <text start="645.52" dur="3.48">talking about this is why they had</text>
  <text start="646.66" dur="5.76">freedom of the speech and they backed it</text>
  <text start="649" dur="7.92">up with the Second Amendment now out in</text>
  <text start="652.42" dur="6.06">North Korea we understand the US and</text>
  <text start="656.92" dur="3.6">many of the private was in central bank</text>
  <text start="658.48" dur="4.2">countries have been pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="660.52" dur="3.75">that North Korea has some type of</text>
  <text start="662.68" dur="2.37">hydrogen bomb they detonated it</text>
  <text start="664.27" dur="2.43">underground</text>
  <text start="665.05" dur="3.33">and of course there&amp;#39;s no evidence</text>
  <text start="666.7" dur="3.15">whatsoever that they actually did this</text>
  <text start="668.38" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s no radiation there&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="669.85" dur="4.68">nothing all we saw it was an earthquake</text>
  <text start="671.77" dur="4.26">but they used the propaganda to increase</text>
  <text start="674.53" dur="3.74">their military budgets to bring in new</text>
  <text start="676.03" dur="4.62">weapons and the u.s. was discussing</text>
  <text start="678.27" dur="6.64">bringing in the sad anti-ballistic</text>
  <text start="680.65" dur="8.22">missile systems of South Korea so John</text>
  <text start="684.91" dur="8.69">Kerry is out there and says that the</text>
  <text start="688.87" dur="4.73">United States they want to use diplomacy</text>
  <text start="693.61" dur="3.42">and they really don&amp;#39;t want to deploy the</text>
  <text start="695.38" dur="6.21">THAAD anti-ballistic missile system to</text>
  <text start="697.03" dur="7.89">South Korea and will use diplomacy as</text>
  <text start="701.59" dur="7.47">soon as North Korea agrees to D</text>
  <text start="704.92" dur="7.89">nuclearization so once they do that then</text>
  <text start="709.06" dur="6.12">we&amp;#39;ll use diplomatic measures well no</text>
  <text start="712.81" dur="7.52">that&amp;#39;s an ultimatum that&amp;#39;s not having</text>
  <text start="715.18" dur="9.6">diplomacy get rid of all your nuclear</text>
  <text start="720.33" dur="7.03">projects and then we&amp;#39;ll talk no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="724.78" dur="5.88">going in there and talking about all the</text>
  <text start="727.36" dur="6.06">issues but again the United States</text>
  <text start="730.66" dur="5.61">doesn&amp;#39;t want to do this they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="733.42" dur="8.07">using this to make it seem like they</text>
  <text start="736.27" dur="6.99">want a diplomatic solution they just</text>
  <text start="741.49" dur="3.15">gave North Korea an ultimatum and you</text>
  <text start="743.26" dur="3.75">know North Korea&amp;#39;s gonna say well no</text>
  <text start="744.64" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re not going to do that let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="747.01" dur="4.23">about everything that&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="749.08" dur="3.47">and the u.s. is going to say no I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="751.24" dur="4.11">think so</text>
  <text start="752.55" dur="5.77">now we see the corporate media is making</text>
  <text start="755.35" dur="5.31">a very big deal about China and the</text>

  <text start="760.66" dur="6.66">there&amp;#39;s air defense missile systems on</text>
  <text start="764.98" dur="4.32">there now they&amp;#39;re saying that China has</text>
  <text start="767.32" dur="4.89">deployed fighter jets to the island now</text>
  <text start="769.3" dur="5.1">I&amp;#39;ve seen the satellite imagery they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="772.21" dur="5.1">black and white we&amp;#39;ve reported this in a</text>
  <text start="774.4" dur="7.11">pre a couple reports back they&amp;#39;re blurry</text>
  <text start="777.31" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;re black smudges on the island they</text>
  <text start="781.51" dur="5.25">could be trucks are they air defense</text>
  <text start="784.39" dur="4.41">systems I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s hard to see</text>
  <text start="786.76" dur="4.68">because they&amp;#39;re not using the full color</text>
  <text start="788.8" dur="6.42">3d satellite imagery that they use for</text>
  <text start="791.44" dur="5.1">everything else if you notice in Syria</text>
  <text start="795.22" dur="5.67">when they wanted to point out that</text>
  <text start="796.54" dur="7.8">Russia had their fighter jets on the</text>
  <text start="800.89" dur="8.1">runway they gave us some nice beautiful</text>
  <text start="804.34" dur="8.82">color 3d satellite imagery and we saw</text>
  <text start="808.99" dur="7.62">every detail for China they&amp;#39;re giving us</text>
  <text start="813.16" dur="6.33">the black and white zoomed out version</text>
  <text start="816.61" dur="5.22">of us but they&amp;#39;re making a very big deal</text>
  <text start="819.49" dur="4.71">now you have to remember they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="821.83" dur="3.99">the bully tactic where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="824.2" dur="3.24">encircling China bringing in more</text>
  <text start="825.82" dur="3.72">missile systems setting up</text>
  <text start="827.44" dur="4.07">more Patriot missiles in South Korea</text>
  <text start="829.54" dur="4.58">they want to bring in the THAAD system</text>
  <text start="831.51" dur="5.41">they made a deal with the Philippines</text>
  <text start="834.12" dur="5.82">they want to create this new base in</text>

  <text start="839.94" dur="5.49">China sees this happening now just</text>
  <text start="842.86" dur="6.18">trying to have weapons on the islands</text>
  <text start="845.43" dur="5.95">first of all it&amp;#39;s not confirmed the US</text>
  <text start="849.04" dur="5.52">if they actually really had proof it&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="851.38" dur="5.34">be plastered with beautiful color 3d</text>
  <text start="854.56" dur="5.88">satellite imagery when they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="856.72" dur="6.42">propaganda they use the zoomed out type</text>
  <text start="860.44" dur="3.96">of version where they tell you this is</text>
  <text start="863.14" dur="6.51">what they think and if you look at a lot</text>
  <text start="864.4" dur="7.71">of it it says possibly probably not a</text>
  <text start="869.65" dur="4.29">definite but China does have every right</text>
  <text start="872.11" dur="7.46">to put this on the island because they</text>
  <text start="873.94" dur="9.3">own the islands and the US is basically</text>
  <text start="879.57" dur="5.47">trying to do to force them into doing</text>
  <text start="883.24" dur="5.7">this remember these are air defense</text>
  <text start="885.04" dur="5.91">systems just like in Eastern Europe when</text>
  <text start="888.94" dur="4.26">the u.s. put the missile shield there</text>
  <text start="890.95" dur="4.53">what was Russia is supposed to do I mean</text>
  <text start="893.2" dur="5.73">they know the US was saying oh it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="895.48" dur="5.43">for Russia it&amp;#39;s for Iran but really when</text>
  <text start="898.93" dur="3.57">the p5 plus 1 deal went through the</text>
  <text start="900.91" dur="3.87">missile shield stayed and it&amp;#39;s pointing</text>
  <text start="902.5" dur="9.86">at Russia so Russia is going to take</text>
  <text start="904.78" dur="10.38">precautions so how in Iraq we see that</text>
  <text start="912.36" dur="7.06">turkey still has troops in Iraq and Iraq</text>
  <text start="915.16" dur="6.21">is saying you know something we need you</text>
  <text start="919.42" dur="4.65">to remove your troops this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="921.37" dur="6.75">ridiculous you&amp;#39;re in a sovereign nation</text>
  <text start="924.07" dur="6.6">and you have no right to be here but</text>
  <text start="928.12" dur="3.54">again Turkey doesn&amp;#39;t listen they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="935.95" dur="6.15">gonna stay if they tell Turkey to</text>
  <text start="940.15" dur="5.73">continually shelling into Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="942.1" dur="6">going to do it and as they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="945.88" dur="3.45">them to do it the u.s. is going to deny</text>
  <text start="948.1" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;re telling them to do it and</text>
  <text start="949.33" dur="3.47">they&amp;#39;re going to say please back off</text>
  <text start="950.8" dur="6.09">please don&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="952.8" dur="7.21">but when Russia brings up the draft to</text>
  <text start="956.89" dur="4.41">the UN Security Council to have turkey</text>
  <text start="960.01" dur="4.44">stop shelling into Syria</text>
  <text start="961.3" dur="5.76">the West rejects it and this is how you</text>
  <text start="964.45" dur="4.14">know it&amp;#39;s propaganda in the corporate</text>
  <text start="967.06" dur="3.96">media and everything they&amp;#39;re saying to</text>
  <text start="968.59" dur="4.5">the people because in the back rooms and</text>
  <text start="971.02" dur="8.07">the dark halls we see what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="973.09" dur="7.32">going on we see in Libya the Islamic</text>
  <text start="979.09" dur="3.72">state the proxy army for the United</text>
  <text start="980.41" dur="4.68">States government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="982.81" dur="5.07">are continually recruiting more fighters</text>
  <text start="985.09" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re trying to build up the forces</text>
  <text start="987.88" dur="8.34">and they&amp;#39;re trying to create the</text>
  <text start="991.72" dur="7.5">situation where the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="996.22" dur="4.71">will need to go into Libya now remember</text>
  <text start="999.22" dur="3.57">they want the unity government in there</text>
  <text start="1000.93" dur="4.86">because the unity government will give</text>
  <text start="1002.79" dur="7.14">them permission to go into Libya right</text>
  <text start="1005.79" dur="7.52">now Paris they&amp;#39;re already conducting</text>
  <text start="1009.93" dur="8.22">covert anti - operations anti - is</text>
  <text start="1013.31" dur="7.3">Islamic state and basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1018.15" dur="6.89">doing is not fighting the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1020.61" dur="8.97">they&amp;#39;re fighting those people who oppose</text>
  <text start="1025.04" dur="7.03">the puppet government so the French</text>
  <text start="1029.58" dur="5.1">special forces and the u.s. special</text>
  <text start="1032.07" dur="9.269">forces and other special forces are</text>
  <text start="1034.68" dur="9.45">already inside of Libya and we can see</text>
  <text start="1041.339" dur="7.981">what&amp;#39;s happening right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1044.13" dur="8.55">clearing the way getting ready for some</text>
  <text start="1049.32" dur="8.04">type of military action inside Libya we</text>
  <text start="1052.68" dur="6.93">know in Italy on the island of Sicily</text>
  <text start="1057.36" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;ve given permission to have the</text>
  <text start="1059.61" dur="7.52">drones to have drone missions into Libya</text>
  <text start="1062.07" dur="7.5">and we see all this coming together now</text>
  <text start="1067.13" dur="5.05">now the Syrian Foreign Ministry says</text>
  <text start="1069.57" dur="4.77">listen any group in Syria that violates</text>
  <text start="1072.18" dur="5.4">the ceasefire is going to be regarded as</text>
  <text start="1074.34" dur="4.65">terrorists now this new ceasefire deal</text>
  <text start="1077.58" dur="5.4">that&amp;#39;s supposed to go into full force on</text>
  <text start="1078.99" dur="6.18">February 27th is Saturday this is</text>
  <text start="1082.98" dur="5.31">causing the Syrian peace talks to be</text>
  <text start="1085.17" dur="6.39">delayed until March so they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="1088.29" dur="4.8">to have the full-on peace talks until</text>
  <text start="1091.56" dur="3.74">March at this point now the Pentagon is</text>
  <text start="1093.09" dur="5.16">out there saying even</text>
  <text start="1095.3" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s this ceasefire and a cooperation</text>
  <text start="1098.25" dur="4.26">with Russia</text>
  <text start="1099.53" dur="6.16">this will not lead to further</text>
  <text start="1102.51" dur="4.85">cooperation with Russia down the line so</text>
  <text start="1105.69" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re already letting us know that</text>
  <text start="1107.36" dur="6.52">they&amp;#39;re not going to cooperate any time</text>
  <text start="1110.19" dur="6.71">past this so Russia is taking steps to</text>
  <text start="1113.88" dur="7.16">defuse the situation once again in Syria</text>
  <text start="1116.9" dur="8.08">Turkey is continually shelling Russia</text>
  <text start="1121.04" dur="5.98">wants an appraisal of turkeys shelling</text>
  <text start="1124.98" dur="5.36">into Syria they&amp;#39;re calling on</text>
  <text start="1127.02" dur="7.38">international human rights organization</text>
  <text start="1130.34" dur="6.67">like Amnesty International Human Rights</text>
  <text start="1134.4" dur="4.86">Watch Doctors Without Borders and other</text>
  <text start="1137.01" dur="6.09">organizations to give their official</text>
  <text start="1139.26" dur="5.87">assessment on what Turkey is actually</text>
  <text start="1143.1" dur="5.76">doing and who they are actually shelling</text>
  <text start="1145.13" dur="6.19">now we know the answer to this but this</text>
  <text start="1148.86" dur="3.72">is a good way to prove what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1151.32" dur="3.6">actually doing and I know some of these</text>
  <text start="1152.58" dur="6.03">organizations they&amp;#39;re not really on the</text>
  <text start="1154.92" dur="5.67">up-and-up but we&amp;#39;re hoping by getting</text>
  <text start="1158.61" dur="6.06">the majority of them in there we can see</text>
  <text start="1160.59" dur="5.7">what&amp;#39;s really going on and we know</text>
  <text start="1164.67" dur="4.53">what&amp;#39;s going on they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="1166.29" dur="4.56">the car door open to supply the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1169.2" dur="3.15">state because this ceasefire has nothing</text>
  <text start="1170.85" dur="3.75">to do with the Islamic state al Qaeda al</text>
  <text start="1172.35" dur="4.8">nusra it has to do with what the one</text>
  <text start="1174.6" dur="4.56">rebel guy that they&amp;#39;re using to say</text>
  <text start="1177.15" dur="3.24">these are the rebels because you know</text>
  <text start="1179.16" dur="3.21">what happens they switch back and forth</text>
  <text start="1180.39" dur="4.47">oh we&amp;#39;re the moderate rebels oh no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1182.37" dur="4.92">the terrorist group and they do this so</text>
  <text start="1184.86" dur="3.36">often that you can&amp;#39;t make heads or tail</text>
  <text start="1187.29" dur="4.46">of this so basically they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1188.22" dur="6.24">terrorists and the u.s. knows this and</text>
  <text start="1191.75" dur="8.8">they&amp;#39;re using this to their advantage at</text>
  <text start="1194.46" dur="7.68">this point now remember John Kerry has</text>
  <text start="1200.55" dur="3.99">already said they have a plan B now are</text>
  <text start="1202.14" dur="5.97">they gonna push this plan well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1204.54" dur="5.13">going to try is it going to work yeah I</text>
  <text start="1208.11" dur="5.69">don&amp;#39;t know at this point because we</text>
  <text start="1209.67" dur="8.1">already hear Syria saying listen we</text>
  <text start="1213.8" dur="7.18">object to this plan be where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1217.77" dur="8.13">going to try to split up the country and</text>
  <text start="1220.98" dur="7.11">partition it they said first of all the</text>
  <text start="1225.9" dur="3.04">territorial integrity of Syria is dear</text>
  <text start="1228.09" dur="4.6">to every person</text>
  <text start="1228.94" dur="6.12">in Syria we want to keep it as a whole</text>
  <text start="1232.69" dur="4.62">and the Security Council resolution to</text>
  <text start="1235.06" dur="5.22">254 insists on the territorial integrity</text>
  <text start="1237.31" dur="4.26">and unity of Syria and the Syrian people</text>
  <text start="1240.28" dur="5.1">will never accept the partition of the</text>
  <text start="1241.57" dur="8.67">country so we can see already this is</text>
  <text start="1245.38" dur="6.33">completely a no-go and we can see John</text>
  <text start="1250.24" dur="4.26">Kerry is putting this out there because</text>
  <text start="1251.71" dur="5.67">we know in the past Ashton Carter Joe</text>
  <text start="1254.5" dur="5.85">Biden was pushing the same idea with</text>
  <text start="1257.38" dur="4.5">rack then get any traction there putting</text>
  <text start="1260.35" dur="2.7">this out there once again because as we</text>
  <text start="1261.88" dur="3.3">know they want to take the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1263.05" dur="4.47">and they want to split it into Shiite</text>
  <text start="1265.18" dur="5.67">Sunni and Kurds and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1267.52" dur="8.55">trying to push and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1270.85" dur="12.54">continually try to push this so what is</text>
  <text start="1276.07" dur="9.72">happening right now in Syria well the</text>
  <text start="1283.39" dur="4.11">u.s. is going to use this time because</text>
  <text start="1285.79" dur="4.47">as we know humanitarian aid is going to</text>
  <text start="1287.5" dur="6.03">be moving into Syria and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1290.26" dur="5.67">to use this time to basically rearm the</text>
  <text start="1293.53" dur="3.72">terrorists because the terrorists are</text>
  <text start="1295.93" dur="3.33">not part of this and they&amp;#39;ll say this is</text>
  <text start="1297.25" dur="4.53">humanitarian aid it&amp;#39;s going into the</text>
  <text start="1299.26" dur="4.53">town where there&amp;#39;s al nusra and the</text>
  <text start="1301.78" dur="3.45">moderate rebels and you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="1303.79" dur="2.88">this is going to go to the terrorists</text>
  <text start="1305.23" dur="4.05">because there&amp;#39;s only one moderate rebel</text>
  <text start="1306.67" dur="7.17">and they&amp;#39;re going to use this time to</text>
  <text start="1309.28" dur="6.06">basically rearm the terrace so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1313.84" dur="5.22">gonna have to watch this situation very</text>
  <text start="1315.34" dur="5.64">very carefully now out in other parts of</text>
  <text start="1319.06" dur="4.4">the Middle East we see very interesting</text>
  <text start="1320.98" dur="5.31">things happening right now Kuwait Qatar</text>
  <text start="1323.46" dur="7.48">they&amp;#39;ve issued travel warnings against</text>
  <text start="1326.29" dur="8.46">Lebanon now Saudi Arabia has already</text>
  <text start="1330.94" dur="10.94">issued these alerts and they halted a</text>
  <text start="1334.75" dur="9.33">four billion dollar grant to Lebanon and</text>
  <text start="1341.88" dur="6.64">they&amp;#39;re saying we&amp;#39;re not in harmony with</text>
  <text start="1344.08" dur="6.78">the ties between the two countries so</text>
  <text start="1348.52" dur="6.87">something is happening in this area and</text>
  <text start="1350.86" dur="7.14">we see Kuwait Qatar Saudi Arabia and the</text>
  <text start="1355.39" dur="4.83">United Arab Emirates and other countries</text>
  <text start="1358" dur="4.38">putting up this warning guitars saying</text>
  <text start="1360.22" dur="2.55">they would like all their people to</text>

  <text start="1369.79" dur="7.38">pulling out their ground troops right</text>
  <text start="1371.62" dur="10.35">now from Yemen so at this point we can</text>
  <text start="1377.17" dur="10.02">see something is about to happen inside</text>
  <text start="1381.97" dur="7.49">this area now is Lebanon falling apart</text>
  <text start="1387.19" dur="6.09">very quickly are the people rising up</text>
  <text start="1389.46" dur="6.42">pushing the puppet government out is the</text>
  <text start="1393.28" dur="5.88">United States with the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="1395.88" dur="5.53">basically getting the troops together to</text>
  <text start="1399.16" dur="5.76">mount a major offensive in this whole</text>
  <text start="1401.41" dur="4.86">entire area because it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="1404.92" dur="3.63">look like that right now</text>
  <text start="1406.27" dur="6.03">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
