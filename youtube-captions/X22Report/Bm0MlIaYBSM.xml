  <text start="204.67" dur="4.59">be talking about that in just a minute</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="6.05">but out in the UK we can see that things</text>
  <text start="209.26" dur="6.51">are not going well for the EU</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="6.7">jean-claude Juncker he appeared to shrug</text>
  <text start="215.77" dur="5.22">off responsibility for the brexit in the</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="4.17">latest a series of comments forcing the</text>
  <text start="220.99" dur="6.6">point that the brexit negotiations are</text>
  <text start="222.85" dur="8.1">now beyond being reopened and the UK is</text>
  <text start="227.59" dur="7.59">saying that we still might have a no</text>
  <text start="230.95" dur="6.09">deal brexit option now Theresa May will</text>
  <text start="235.18" dur="3.93">meet with jean-claude Juncker they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="4.08">the ones who created the deal in the</text>
  <text start="239.11" dur="4.11">first place it wasn&amp;#39;t the people&amp;#39;s deal</text>
  <text start="241.12" dur="3.9">it was the deal for the central bank and</text>
  <text start="243.22" dur="5.489">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see how this all</text>
  <text start="245.02" dur="6.8">plays out because as we know that people</text>
  <text start="248.709" dur="7.051">want to be completely separate and apart</text>
  <text start="251.82" dur="8.08">the EU the central bankers they want</text>
  <text start="255.76" dur="6.09">control over the people so we have two</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="3.36">things happening here and remember the</text>
  <text start="261.85" dur="5.13">biggest fear of the central bankers</text>
  <text start="263.26" dur="7.2">those who aren&amp;#39;t elected those people</text>
  <text start="266.98" dur="7.53">that are pointed into these positions by</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="7.38">other elites not by the people they</text>
  <text start="274.51" dur="7.34">don&amp;#39;t want anyone to realize that if we</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="7.44">get rid of the central bank system</text>
  <text start="281.85" dur="7.36">economies will prosper this is their</text>
  <text start="285.28" dur="5.43">biggest fear and they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="4.08">out in the open</text>
  <text start="290.71" dur="4.53">they don&amp;#39;t want this transparent think</text>
  <text start="293.29" dur="3.239">about the central bankers think about</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="3.269">the elite think about</text>
  <text start="296.529" dur="5.1">the deep state if you notice they all</text>
  <text start="298.509" dur="6.63">have something very very in common they</text>
  <text start="301.629" dur="6.9">don&amp;#39;t like transparency yes they like</text>
  <text start="305.139" dur="5.31">propaganda transparency where they tell</text>
  <text start="308.529" dur="4.47">you what&amp;#39;s going on and they pretend</text>
  <text start="310.449" dur="6.09">it&amp;#39;s transparent but they do not like</text>
  <text start="312.999" dur="6.81">true transparency they don&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="316.539" dur="5.13">truth because it hurts their mission and</text>
  <text start="319.809" dur="5.34">their mission from the very very</text>
  <text start="321.669" dur="5.79">beginning was to control the world I</text>
  <text start="325.149" dur="5.43">mean think about this for a second a lot</text>
  <text start="327.459" dur="6.18">of people think power is having a strong</text>
  <text start="330.579" dur="4.83">military having nuclear weapons where</text>
  <text start="333.639" dur="4.44">you can wipe out the other country or</text>
  <text start="335.409" dur="4.32">fire a nuclear weapons and if they have</text>
  <text start="338.079" dur="4.32">nuclear weapons they fire them back at</text>
  <text start="339.729" dur="5.37">you and what do we have at that point</text>
  <text start="342.399" dur="6.8">well we have a lot of dead people</text>
  <text start="345.099" dur="8.33">is that really power or is power</text>
  <text start="349.199" dur="7.72">creating currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="353.429" dur="8.23">telling governments you must use this</text>
  <text start="356.919" dur="6.6">and you must borrow it from us which is</text>
  <text start="361.659" dur="3.57">the central bank and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="363.519" dur="5.75">charge you interest on something that we</text>
  <text start="365.229" dur="7.56">created out of nothing and the people</text>
  <text start="369.269" dur="7.12">will have to use this currency and the</text>
  <text start="372.789" dur="7.08">people will have to be taxed to pay down</text>
  <text start="376.389" dur="9.29">the interest on the debt that you</text>
  <text start="379.869" dur="9.3">borrowed is that power or is having</text>
  <text start="385.679" dur="7.6">nuclear weapons and a strong military</text>
  <text start="389.169" dur="7.02">power because the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="393.279" dur="6.84">have the ability by doing pretty much</text>
  <text start="396.189" dur="9.29">nothing they have the ability to put all</text>
  <text start="400.119" dur="8.64">nations into debt control the nations</text>
  <text start="405.479" dur="7.54">dictate to the nations what they need to</text>
  <text start="408.759" dur="7.71">do next how they should repay the debt</text>
  <text start="413.019" dur="8.07">and if they can&amp;#39;t repay the debt what</text>
  <text start="416.469" dur="8.28">programs they will need to cut which is</text>
  <text start="421.089" dur="6.701">more powerful well a long time ago</text>
  <text start="424.749" dur="8.021">the Rothschilds realized</text>
  <text start="427.79" dur="8.67">the people who control the currency can</text>
  <text start="432.77" dur="6.51">control nations can control what these</text>
  <text start="436.46" dur="5.46">nations actually do and through this</text>
  <text start="439.28" dur="5.81">creation of currency they have the</text>
  <text start="441.92" dur="5.73">ability to control government officials</text>
  <text start="445.09" dur="6.49">through corruption because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="447.65" dur="8.03">getting all this free money this is the</text>
  <text start="451.58" dur="7.17">most powerful position you can have and</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="6.55">the people are waking up to this</text>
  <text start="458.75" dur="7.59">position now Trump which were reported</text>
  <text start="462.23" dur="6.3">on yesterday he has been putting a stop</text>
  <text start="466.34" dur="4.2">and not just Trump but the Patriots who</text>
  <text start="468.53" dur="4.71">were working with him he&amp;#39;s been putting</text>
  <text start="470.54" dur="5.79">a stop to this recession now don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="5.22">me wrong this economy is a gigantic</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="4.26">illusion it was created by the central</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="4.7">bank the deep state kept it going and</text>
  <text start="480.59" dur="4.83">they were keeping it going long enough</text>
  <text start="483.16" dur="5.62">so this could be blamed on another</text>
  <text start="485.42" dur="5.58">country we were gonna enter war Trump</text>
  <text start="488.78" dur="6.03">came into office they didn&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="491" dur="5.82">option this economy is an illusion the</text>
  <text start="494.81" dur="4.98">stock market is an illusion its</text>
  <text start="496.82" dur="6.29">manipulated its controlled Trump knows</text>
  <text start="499.79" dur="6.87">this but very interesting at a Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="503.11" dur="4.9">they put up an article and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.66" dur="3.45">saying that instead of pausing the</text>
  <text start="508.01" dur="6.08">central bank may need to start cutting</text>
  <text start="510.11" dur="6.93">interest rates to avoid a recession now</text>
  <text start="514.09" dur="5.55">they went on to say that the sharp risk</text>
  <text start="517.04" dur="5.25">on rally and financial markets this year</text>
  <text start="519.64" dur="6.55">strongly suggests that the US economy</text>
  <text start="522.29" dur="9.03">has been inoculated against recession</text>
  <text start="526.19" dur="6.27">risk by the Federal Reserve now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.32" dur="4.5">out there saying that the Federal</text>
  <text start="532.46" dur="6">Reserve by smartly pausing the interest</text>
  <text start="535.82" dur="6.56">rate hikes they stopped the recession</text>
  <text start="538.46" dur="6.81">because they care and to really avoid</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="7.87">another recession the interest rates</text>
  <text start="545.27" dur="7.98">should be reversed now Trump might come</text>
  <text start="550.25" dur="5.37">out and tell the Federal Reserve at this</text>
  <text start="553.25" dur="6.82">point why don&amp;#39;t you drop the interest</text>
  <text start="555.62" dur="6.7">rates a little bit if he does this</text>
  <text start="560.07" dur="4.08">this is complete control doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="562.32" dur="6.06">that he doesn&amp;#39;t have control now but</text>
  <text start="564.15" dur="7.86">this would ensure that the economy does</text>
  <text start="568.38" dur="6.24">not go into a recession in 2020 right</text>
  <text start="572.01" dur="5.49">now everything is paused and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="8.94">saying listen they stopped the recession</text>
  <text start="577.5" dur="9.24">from coming so we see already that Trump</text>
  <text start="583.56" dur="6.48">is controlling the Fed how far will he</text>
  <text start="586.74" dur="4.92">take this we don&amp;#39;t know now the other</text>
  <text start="590.04" dur="3.39">thing that Trump is doing and I do he</text>
  <text start="591.66" dur="7.13">believe he&amp;#39;s doing this regime ping is</text>
  <text start="593.43" dur="8.4">they&amp;#39;ve just taken China and they have</text>
  <text start="598.79" dur="6.52">injected a huge amount of currency into</text>
  <text start="601.83" dur="6.69">the system at the same time Trump and</text>
  <text start="605.31" dur="5.16">China they&amp;#39;re talking about a trade deal</text>
  <text start="608.52" dur="4.35">now everyone said March 1st this is the</text>
  <text start="610.47" dur="5.13">cutoff date and if we don&amp;#39;t meet the</text>
  <text start="612.87" dur="6.99">cutoff date the tariffs come into play</text>
  <text start="615.6" dur="8.31">or remember Trump is in control Trump is</text>
  <text start="619.86" dur="6.81">already saying that listen when the</text>
  <text start="623.91" dur="5.52">March first dates hit it&amp;#39;s not a magical</text>
  <text start="626.67" dur="4.17">date we might be able to extend this a</text>
  <text start="629.43" dur="3.02">little bit because the talks are going</text>
  <text start="630.84" dur="4.88">on right now</text>
  <text start="632.45" dur="6.46">he said we might add a 60-day extension</text>
  <text start="635.72" dur="6.25">to the trade deadline which means there</text>
  <text start="638.91" dur="6.51">are no new tariffs which means the</text>
  <text start="641.97" dur="6.54">economy continues on now are the tariffs</text>
  <text start="645.42" dur="5.67">the problem no but the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="648.51" dur="4.35">will make it look like it&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="651.09" dur="3.87">and I believe this is why he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="652.86" dur="4.59">listen we&amp;#39;ll give China a 60-day</text>
  <text start="654.96" dur="5.06">extension because we&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="657.45" dur="8.22">them right now we&amp;#39;re working out the</text>

  <text start="669" dur="4.29">from every action and from every step</text>
  <text start="671.22" dur="5.67">that Trump of the Patriots are doing at</text>
  <text start="673.29" dur="6.6">this time they are controlling how the</text>
  <text start="676.89" dur="5.64">economy is going to look think about the</text>

  <text start="755.16" dur="8.13">gold would start moving up absolutely</text>
  <text start="760.199" dur="5.971">now is he just gonna shut it down and</text>
  <text start="763.29" dur="5.64">just let gold do what it does best</text>
  <text start="766.17" dur="4.979">no because gold would then shoot up and</text>
  <text start="768.93" dur="4.709">everything would be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="771.149" dur="3.63">disaster I think what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="787.86" dur="5.49">going to accelerate that much this year</text>
  <text start="789.689" dur="7.38">no we might hit 1400 this year maybe</text>
  <text start="793.35" dur="7.679">even 1450 but I think once we get into</text>
  <text start="797.069" dur="5.64">2020 closer to the elections we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="801.029" dur="4.68">gold move up a little bit more and I</text>
  <text start="802.709" dur="5.82">think once we are past the elections and</text>
  <text start="805.709" dur="5.521">Trump is reelected I think there is</text>
  <text start="808.529" dur="6.211">going to be nothing stopping what gold</text>
  <text start="811.23" dur="7.909">and silver can do because Trump has the</text>
  <text start="814.74" dur="8.13">magic wand he will just release the</text>
  <text start="819.139" dur="7.741">manipulation system and this will allow</text>
  <text start="822.87" dur="8.01">gold to really</text>
  <text start="826.88" dur="6.31">expose the central bank in what they</text>

  <text start="845.55" dur="6.12">destroy the central bank in the process</text>
  <text start="849.23" dur="3.82">this is what we are watching that does</text>
  <text start="851.67" dur="3.419">this mean that Gold&amp;#39;s not gonna go down</text>
  <text start="853.05" dur="4.14">then up yes we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="855.089" dur="4.261">fluctuation but when you look at the</text>
  <text start="857.19" dur="4.23">overall picture you&amp;#39;re gonna see it</text>
  <text start="859.35" dur="4.859">continually move up and up and up now</text>
  <text start="861.42" dur="4.62">what about silver silver is going to</text>

  <text start="876.81" dur="4.529">because remember when the gold price</text>
  <text start="878.73" dur="4.95">moves up that means it takes more and</text>
  <text start="881.339" dur="5.161">more of those reserve notes to buy the</text>
  <text start="883.68" dur="4.62">same ounce of gold it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
