  <text start="274.53" dur="6.12">set weekly and allocations to member</text>
  <text start="276.81" dur="7.14">countries determined via IMF criteria so</text>
  <text start="280.65" dur="5.46">this entire system is completely</text>
  <text start="283.95" dur="6.12">controlled by the central bank</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="5.52">governments have nothing to do with it</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="5.04">whatsoever they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="291.63" dur="6.45">independent now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="3.57">second the central banks they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="2.94">planning the</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="4.97">for quite a while and we know that they</text>
  <text start="301.02" dur="5.489">always have backup plans we know that</text>
  <text start="303.65" dur="6.389">they don&amp;#39;t want their system to be</text>
  <text start="306.509" dur="6.891">removed they want to stay in control and</text>
  <text start="310.039" dur="5.951">they&amp;#39;re trying to push their agenda by</text>
  <text start="313.4" dur="3.85">moving everyone and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.99" dur="3.87">hoping they&amp;#39;re hoping with the collapse</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="4.68">of the entire economic system they can</text>
  <text start="319.86" dur="4.5">come out and they can say listen we have</text>
  <text start="321.93" dur="6.299">something already prepared we can move</text>
  <text start="324.36" dur="6.75">the entire world to this system now this</text>
  <text start="328.229" dur="5.491">would be very different than having one</text>
  <text start="331.11" dur="5.46">country as the reserve currency of the</text>
  <text start="333.72" dur="6.24">world this system would be totally</text>
  <text start="336.57" dur="6.39">controlled by the IMF by the central</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="8.07">bankers they wouldn&amp;#39;t even have to</text>
  <text start="342.96" dur="7.23">report to a country or ask to allow them</text>
  <text start="348.03" dur="4.53">to extend laws or anything like that</text>
  <text start="350.19" dur="7.92">they would they would have complete and</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="8.31">utter control but we know the downfall</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="5.1">is going to be when they&amp;#39;re exposed and</text>
  <text start="360.87" dur="4.65">I remember their I mean their whole</text>
  <text start="363.21" dur="5.97">entire plan was to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="365.52" dur="4.709">that there was a an event a war or</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="2.79">something else</text>
  <text start="370.229" dur="3.66">this way they can take everyone and say</text>
  <text start="371.97" dur="3.54">hey don&amp;#39;t look over here look over there</text>
  <text start="373.889" dur="4.831">at that event see that event over there</text>
  <text start="375.51" dur="7.08">that is the problem now it could be a</text>
  <text start="378.72" dur="5.729">war it could be the trade war it could</text>
  <text start="382.59" dur="4.77">be anything this is what they were</text>
  <text start="384.449" dur="5.581">hoping already with Trump with phase one</text>
  <text start="387.36" dur="5.61">of the trade deal with China their trade</text>
  <text start="390.03" dur="7.169">war narrative is starting to break down</text>
  <text start="392.97" dur="7.979">I do believe in 2020 we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="397.199" dur="7.65">Trump the Patriots and China work out</text>
  <text start="400.949" dur="6.96">phase two of the trade deal once this</text>
  <text start="404.849" dur="5.431">happens the narrative that the trade war</text>
  <text start="407.909" dur="5.01">is causing all this problem all these</text>
  <text start="410.28" dur="6.509">problems around the world that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="412.919" dur="7.74">to start to fail they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="416.789" dur="6.181">explain this this is when Trump and many</text>
  <text start="420.659" dur="5.1">other individuals within other countries</text>
  <text start="422.97" dur="6.72">are going to start to talk about how it</text>
  <text start="425.759" dur="4.891">is a central bank problem not a trade</text>
  <text start="429.69" dur="4.17">war problem</text>
  <text start="430.65" dur="5.73">not a country problem and this is going</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="5.91">to be a major problem for the central</text>
  <text start="436.38" dur="7.08">bankers the Patriots they actually have</text>
  <text start="439.77" dur="6.66">the upper hand in all of this because</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="8.25">they removed the ability of the central</text>
  <text start="446.43" dur="6.42">bank to push a certain event and since</text>
  <text start="451.71" dur="4.08">they can&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="452.85" dur="6.69">the Patriots now have the ability to</text>
  <text start="455.79" dur="5.73">expose them this is what they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="459.54" dur="4.879">about this is what they&amp;#39;re panicking</text>
  <text start="461.52" dur="5.459">about this is why the Dutch central bank</text>
  <text start="464.419" dur="7.451">shocked many with its claim that if the</text>
  <text start="466.979" dur="8.671">entire system collapses the gold is the</text>
  <text start="471.87" dur="7.53">only thing that will allow the entire</text>
  <text start="475.65" dur="6.78">system to start over they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="479.4" dur="6.45">see the writing on the wall they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="482.43" dur="5.66">starting to realize that their entire</text>
  <text start="485.85" dur="7.08">plan everything that they planned on is</text>
  <text start="488.09" dur="8.98">not going to work and moving to an SDR</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="6.72">system will also not work because Trump</text>
  <text start="497.07" dur="5.94">and the Patriots they already have their</text>
  <text start="499.65" dur="6.09">own plans to counter everything the</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="5.79">central bank is going to try to do the</text>
  <text start="505.74" dur="6.359">UK is going to be on board once they</text>
  <text start="508.8" dur="7.47">leave the brexit Australia will be on</text>
  <text start="512.099" dur="8.07">board Italy will be on board and many</text>
  <text start="516.27" dur="7.05">other countries as we move forward one</text>
  <text start="520.169" dur="7.561">as we know the Federal Reserve Note that</text>
  <text start="523.32" dur="7.17">is a dying currency system Trump and the</text>
  <text start="527.73" dur="5.16">Patriots they know this already they</text>
  <text start="530.49" dur="5.599">know that there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do</text>
  <text start="532.89" dur="5.67">with this it&amp;#39;s a system that only is</text>
  <text start="536.089" dur="4.931">pre-programmed to last for a certain</text>
  <text start="538.56" dur="5.88">period of time and then that the weight</text>
  <text start="541.02" dur="6.15">of debt just completely brings down this</text>
  <text start="544.44" dur="5.04">is why Trump the Patriots when they came</text>
  <text start="547.17" dur="5.25">into power this is why the deep state</text>
  <text start="549.48" dur="5.31">the central bank everyone is fighting</text>
  <text start="552.42" dur="4.53">against them it&amp;#39;s just not one faction</text>
  <text start="554.79" dur="6.9">there are many different factions and</text>
  <text start="556.95" dur="7.42">they all have something to lose each</text>
  <text start="561.69" dur="5.76">group has their specific thing that they</text>
  <text start="564.37" dur="6.15">or the specific group will be exposed</text>
  <text start="567.45" dur="6.28">this is why you see different groups</text>
  <text start="570.52" dur="5.19">hitting at Trump very very hard the</text>
  <text start="573.73" dur="5.31">central bank has been talking about</text>
  <text start="575.71" dur="6.15">Trump with trade wars saying that if</text>
  <text start="579.04" dur="5.67">this continues it will bring down the</text>
  <text start="581.86" dur="6.15">entire economic system the trade wars</text>
  <text start="584.71" dur="5.79">need to end and they really thought that</text>
  <text start="588.01" dur="5.22">they would never end they thought that</text>
  <text start="590.5" dur="6.27">the Chinese would keep up their end</text>
  <text start="593.23" dur="6.15">where they would continue this going</text>
  <text start="596.77" dur="4.62">into the 2020 election and at that point</text>
  <text start="599.38" dur="4.709">they were hoping the whole entire system</text>
  <text start="601.39" dur="3.99">would completely fall apart this is why</text>
  <text start="604.089" dur="3.601">they&amp;#39;re talking about recession this is</text>
  <text start="605.38" dur="5.52">why they&amp;#39;re talking about depression but</text>
  <text start="607.69" dur="5.82">all of this is not going to happen the</text>
  <text start="610.9" dur="5.58">Patriots are in control Trump</text>
  <text start="613.51" dur="5.04">understands and he realizes what needs</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="5.609">to be done before that time period and</text>
  <text start="618.55" dur="6.51">as you can see each phase will</text>
  <text start="622.089" dur="5.221">completely counter the narrative of the</text>
  <text start="625.06" dur="6.05">central bank system and they will be</text>
  <text start="627.31" dur="7.43">stuck and once we hit that point where</text>
  <text start="631.11" dur="8.68">Trump wins the elections once again and</text>
  <text start="634.74" dur="8.349">the deep state the swamp is drained we</text>
  <text start="639.79" dur="6.48">move into the next phase we move into</text>
  <text start="643.089" dur="5.881">the phase where Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="646.27" dur="7.11">they go after the big kahuna the big</text>
  <text start="648.97" dur="6.36">kahuna is the central bank system this</text>
  <text start="653.38" dur="4.34">is going to be a battle because the</text>
  <text start="655.33" dur="6.33">central bank system is the source of</text>
  <text start="657.72" dur="6.79">almost everything that we see today the</text>

  <text start="674.26" dur="8.43">poverty for dead for families being in</text>
  <text start="679.3" dur="6.63">debt and all of this is about to change</text>
  <text start="682.69" dur="6.3">and what did the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="685.93" dur="4.349">deep state hate the most change they</text>
  <text start="688.99" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t want anything to change</text>
  <text start="690.279" dur="5.911">unless it benefits them if it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="693.25" dur="5.6">benefit them and people are awakened and</text>
  <text start="696.19" dur="5.34">they start to real</text>

  <text start="710.65" dur="8.04">also game over for the swamp it&amp;#39;s game</text>
  <text start="714.1" dur="6.06">over for all these players so as Trump</text>
  <text start="718.69" dur="4.28">and the Patriots move forward they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="720.16" dur="6.42">getting rid of the outlying blocks as</text>
  <text start="722.97" dur="7.78">they approach and hit the central bank</text>
  <text start="726.58" dur="7.68">and that is their last operation and</text>
  <text start="730.75" dur="5.7">they need to remove all the corruption</text>
  <text start="734.26" dur="5.61">all the blocks and everything that you</text>
  <text start="736.45" dur="6.51">see here so they can reset the entire</text>
  <text start="739.87" dur="5.01">economic system and not in the way that</text>
  <text start="742.96" dur="5.16">the central bank wants but in the way</text>
  <text start="744.88" dur="6.54">the Patriots and the people want very</text>
