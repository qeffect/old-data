  <text start="285.909" dur="5.331">individuals they&amp;#39;re going to say that</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="6.569">we&amp;#39;re going to collapse any second now</text>
  <text start="291.24" dur="4.71">remember we went through this before yes</text>

  <text start="299" dur="6.82">everything that you look at is built on</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="7.5">an illusion the illusion is being</text>
  <text start="305.82" dur="5.76">propped up once again and it is working</text>
  <text start="309.27" dur="4.92">is it going to stay this way</text>
  <text start="311.58" dur="4.02">is this what Trump and the Patriots want</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="4.44">they want to keep this illusion alive</text>
  <text start="315.6" dur="7.29">for many many years no this will not</text>
  <text start="318.63" dur="6.17">help the everyday person so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="322.89" dur="4.89">going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="4.84">transition us out of this central bank</text>
  <text start="327.78" dur="4.5">system now if we look at the economy</text>
  <text start="329.64" dur="6.48">today yesterday I reported on new home</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="8.63">sales how they rebounded existing home</text>

  <text start="344.76" dur="4.59">rose by one point three percent month on</text>
  <text start="346.89" dur="5.28">month and if you look at the</text>
  <text start="349.35" dur="6.12">year-on-year they&amp;#39;ve risen by two point</text>
  <text start="352.17" dur="6.6">four eight percent we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="355.47" dur="5.58">complete turnaround right now and this</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="4.98">is exactly what Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="361.05" dur="6.51">wanted to do this is their way of</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="7.98">controlling the economic system they set</text>
  <text start="367.56" dur="5.31">up a shield around the economic system</text>
  <text start="371.73" dur="3.96">and no matter what the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="4.89">says they will not be able to penetrate</text>
  <text start="375.69" dur="4.74">this shield no matter how many times</text>
  <text start="377.76" dur="4.8">they say recession Trump and the</text>
  <text start="380.43" dur="6.08">Patriots will not allow a recession to</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="7.01">happen until they want it to happen</text>
  <text start="386.51" dur="6.7">think about what we talked about in</text>
  <text start="389.57" dur="6.94">reports going back many years the</text>
  <text start="393.21" dur="6.38">central bank over the many years they</text>
  <text start="396.51" dur="5.93">can control when the economy does well</text>

  <text start="402.44" dur="4.33">implodes on itself and goes into a</text>
  <text start="404.73" dur="4.35">recession or depression then they can</text>
  <text start="406.77" dur="4.89">prop it up again and then they can have</text>
  <text start="409.08" dur="5.37">the same thing happen again the central</text>
  <text start="411.66" dur="6.03">bank system is designed that way it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="536.53" dur="7.32">in time right before 71 the central bank</text>
  <text start="540.88" dur="5.91">system they were planning on removing us</text>
  <text start="543.85" dur="4.65">from the gold standard because the</text>
  <text start="546.79" dur="3.84">central bank system attached to the gold</text>
  <text start="548.5" dur="4.92">standard they can&amp;#39;t do what they do best</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="6.15">and that is create currency put nations</text>
  <text start="553.42" dur="5.79">into debt and a lot more debt spread</text>
  <text start="556.78" dur="4.92">around the world that&amp;#39;s why they had to</text>
  <text start="559.21" dur="3.75">remove us off the gold standard to get</text>
  <text start="561.7" dur="5.55">full and utter</text>
  <text start="562.96" dur="6.84">control and Trump right now with these</text>
  <text start="567.25" dur="5.91">three years they&amp;#39;ve been working on a</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="8.07">plan to transition us back to where we</text>
  <text start="573.16" dur="8.34">were prior to 1913 to bring us back to</text>
  <text start="577.87" dur="6.05">sound money where the government will no</text>
  <text start="581.5" dur="6.39">longer just be able to borrow and borrow</text>
  <text start="583.92" dur="7.11">and borrow and actually never ever pay</text>
  <text start="587.89" dur="5.4">back and put the burden on the people</text>
  <text start="591.03" dur="4.99">that&amp;#39;s not what the founding fathers</text>
  <text start="593.29" dur="5.28">wanted they didn&amp;#39;t want interest</text>
  <text start="596.02" dur="4.47">attached to currency that was created by</text>
  <text start="598.57" dur="4.92">the government they didn&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="600.49" dur="6.51">central bank that had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="603.49" dur="6.18">the government or the people they wanted</text>
  <text start="607" dur="5.25">a system where there were checks and</text>
  <text start="609.67" dur="6.56">balances where everything can be repaid</text>
  <text start="612.25" dur="9.18">if needed and they didn&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="616.23" dur="9.15">taxed that&amp;#39;s not how this was set up the</text>
  <text start="621.43" dur="6.63">central bankers they like to create</text>
  <text start="625.38" dur="5.67">currency out of thin air and then attach</text>
  <text start="628.06" dur="6.69">interest and have government&amp;#39;s borrow it</text>
  <text start="631.05" dur="6.97">the central bank likes to create tax</text>
  <text start="634.75" dur="6.99">policies to enslave the people</text>
  <text start="638.02" dur="5.67">the central bank likes to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="641.74" dur="4.5">markets so they can stay in control</text>
  <text start="643.69" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;re losing control right now</text>
  <text start="646.24" dur="7.86">as soon as Trump gets the Fed at 0%</text>
  <text start="650.83" dur="6.15">which I don&amp;#39;t believe will be that long</text>
  <text start="654.1" dur="4.95">I believe the central bank is going to</text>
  <text start="656.98" dur="4.74">lower the rates once again and then</text>
  <text start="659.05" dur="4.88">coming 2020 we&amp;#39;re gonna see Trump really</text>
  <text start="661.72" dur="4.56">push very hard they&amp;#39;re gonna lower even</text>
  <text start="663.93" dur="3.64">faster than they&amp;#39;re doing it now just</text>
  <text start="666.28" dur="3.45">like they started to raise the rates</text>
  <text start="667.57" dur="3.57">very slowly then they said okay we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="669.73" dur="5.16">gonna do it four times this year and</text>
  <text start="671.14" dur="6.06">they did it in 2018 and then Q told us</text>
  <text start="674.89" dur="5.34">yeah we&amp;#39;re stopping this we know exactly</text>
  <text start="677.2" dur="4.62">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do so in 2020</text>
  <text start="680.23" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re gonna see the rates come down he</text>
  <text start="681.82" dur="5.13">needs to make the Fed obsolete zero</text>
  <text start="684.73" dur="6.51">percent or maybe even negative just like</text>
  <text start="686.95" dur="6.87">the ECB and he needs to take the Fed out</text>
  <text start="691.24" dur="3.57">of the picture because once the Fed is</text>
  <text start="693.82" dur="2.64">out of the picture because what else</text>
  <text start="694.81" dur="3.089">they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="696.46" dur="4.5">I mean think about what Trump is saying</text>
  <text start="697.899" dur="5.551">we need to cut rates we need to cut</text>
  <text start="700.96" dur="5.49">rates is he asking the Fed to help with</text>
  <text start="703.45" dur="5.4">the economic plan no he&amp;#39;s only asked</text>
  <text start="706.45" dur="6.41">them to cut rates and to pump Mahmut</text>
  <text start="708.85" dur="6.989">money currency into the system that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="712.86" dur="5.95">once he gets them to zero or negative he</text>
  <text start="715.839" dur="4.62">doesn&amp;#39;t need them anymore he&amp;#39;s free to</text>
  <text start="718.81" dur="6.33">do what he needs to do they&amp;#39;re out of</text>
