  <text start="58.78" dur="6.029">episode 1490 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.41" dur="5.64">February 5th 2018 and the title the</text>
  <text start="64.809" dur="7.111">episode is the market just erased all of</text>
  <text start="68.05" dur="6.72">the 2018 Gaines distraction watch gold</text>
  <text start="71.92" dur="5.16">and Kryptos let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="74.77" dur="4.47">collapse financial news now as we can</text>
  <text start="77.08" dur="5.58">see the market has come down now Friday</text>
  <text start="79.24" dur="6.72">it came down something like 666 points</text>
  <text start="82.66" dur="6.35">today it came down even more and it</text>
  <text start="85.96" dur="7.14">looks like it erased the 2018 games</text>
  <text start="89.01" dur="5.98">already now people are looking at this</text>
  <text start="93.1" dur="4.71">and saying well is this the crash or is</text>
  <text start="94.99" dur="4.95">this just a tiny correction what is this</text>
  <text start="97.81" dur="4.41">and we have all these different</text>
  <text start="99.94" dur="4.289">financial pundits coming out and giving</text>
  <text start="102.22" dur="3.69">us their explanation where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="104.229" dur="3.541">saying that yes this is a tiny little</text>
  <text start="105.91" dur="3.99">correction there&amp;#39;s plenty of money on</text>
  <text start="107.77" dur="3.93">the side it&amp;#39;s going to go back up but we</text>
  <text start="109.9" dur="5.76">know that this system is completely</text>
  <text start="111.7" dur="7.26">manipulated we know that the system is</text>
  <text start="115.66" dur="6">controlled and what I see the corporate</text>
  <text start="118.96" dur="4.35">media doing right now is they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="121.66" dur="3.989">the idea that people are starting to</text>
  <text start="123.31" dur="4.29">panic that people are saying oh my god I</text>
  <text start="125.649" dur="4.021">better get out of the market but we need</text>
  <text start="127.6" dur="4.11">to do is we need to watch the crypto</text>
  <text start="129.67" dur="4.17">market and especially the gold market</text>
  <text start="131.71" dur="3.81">because what people normally do when</text>
  <text start="133.84" dur="3.39">things like this happen is they rush out</text>
  <text start="135.52" dur="4.71">and they poured into gold something that</text>
  <text start="137.23" dur="5.85">is safe and right now I am not seeing</text>
  <text start="140.23" dur="4.92">that now we&amp;#39;ve seen gold go up a little</text>
  <text start="143.08" dur="5.67">bit you know it&amp;#39;s hovering around the</text>
  <text start="145.15" dur="6.27">$1300 change area but it really hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="148.75" dur="4.62">moved now come this evening the other</text>
  <text start="151.42" dur="4.83">markets around the world China Europe</text>
  <text start="153.37" dur="5.31">and the rest might all of a sudden drop</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="4.2">and we might see more individuals head</text>
  <text start="158.68" dur="4.17">into gold but this is a good indicator</text>
  <text start="160.45" dur="4.98">to let us know where we are headed and</text>
  <text start="162.85" dur="4.23">we can see right now that the crypto</text>
  <text start="165.43" dur="3.81">market is starting to move up once again</text>
  <text start="167.08" dur="5.239">it dropped down to a very low point and</text>
  <text start="169.24" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s starting to push its way back up</text>
  <text start="172.319" dur="5.051">now is this the crash of all crashes as</text>
  <text start="175.18" dur="5.25">of yet well we need to remember one</text>
  <text start="177.37" dur="6.21">thing that&amp;#39;s very important is that this</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="4.41">system is completely controlled by a</text>
  <text start="183.58" dur="3.86">push of a button</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="4.52">by having central</text>
  <text start="187.44" dur="4.68">purchase stock by having the plunge</text>
  <text start="189.36" dur="4.71">protection purchase even more stock so</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="3.75">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is something</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="4.29">that they didn&amp;#39;t expect and the market</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="3.98">came down and they didn&amp;#39;t push the</text>
  <text start="198.36" dur="3.99">buttons they didn&amp;#39;t get everything</text>
  <text start="199.85" dur="5.32">moving in the right direction and most</text>
  <text start="202.35" dur="4.65">likely and I&amp;#39;m thinking that tomorrow</text>
  <text start="205.17" dur="4.65">the next day we&amp;#39;ll start to see the</text>
  <text start="207" dur="4.62">market creep up a little bit and all of</text>
  <text start="209.82" dur="4.17">a sudden people will say who were out of</text>
  <text start="211.62" dur="4.17">the the stock market crash and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="213.99" dur="4.11">call this you know a three four five</text>
  <text start="215.79" dur="4.62">percent type of correction it might drop</text>
  <text start="218.1" dur="3.66">a little bit more but most likely we</text>
  <text start="220.41" dur="3.12">will see this now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="4.92">corporate media is out there trying</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re trying to push a panic to have</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="4.71">the whole thing come down now remember</text>
  <text start="228.72" dur="5.13">there is a huge fight between the</text>
  <text start="231.39" dur="5.49">central bank system and the Trump</text>
  <text start="233.85" dur="5.55">administration the Cabal is integrated</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="5.37">within at the central bank system they</text>
  <text start="239.4" dur="6.18">would like everyone to feel the pain</text>
  <text start="242.25" dur="5.25">that they&amp;#39;re feeling right now and the</text>
  <text start="245.58" dur="3.95">only way to do that is to bring the</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="4.44">system down now this could be a</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="5.08">distraction from everything else that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.94" dur="5.19">been going on because now this is on the</text>
  <text start="254.61" dur="5.55">news it&amp;#39;s the headline news and we might</text>
  <text start="257.13" dur="4.859">see this continue on a couple of days</text>
  <text start="260.16" dur="3.93">where the market drops a little bit and</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="3.721">then it starts moving back up now we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="2.94">have to wait to see how this really</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="4.41">turns out and that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="5.99">gold and the Kryptos but one thing I</text>
  <text start="270.12" dur="6.9">need to say is look how quickly</text>
  <text start="273.02" dur="5.53">everything can turn around and this is</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="3.51">what we&amp;#39;ve been talking about all along</text>
  <text start="278.55" dur="3.72">where people are saying well look it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="5.52">going up and up and up I don&amp;#39;t feel it</text>
  <text start="282.27" dur="5.58">now let&amp;#39;s say this was the crash let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="287.85" dur="3.72">thousand points and another thousand</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="3.39">points and all of a sudden corporations</text>
  <text start="291.57" dur="4.47">and people start to realize what is</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="5.19">happening at what point in time if</text>
  <text start="296.04" dur="5.91">you&amp;#39;re not prepared do you start to go</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="4.95">out and get prepared well it looks like</text>
  <text start="301.95" dur="2.73">you&amp;#39;re gonna be a little too late</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="3.12">because you&amp;#39;ll be sitting here going is</text>
  <text start="304.68" dur="3.6">this the crash I don&amp;#39;t know maybe I</text>
  <text start="306.45" dur="3.75">shouldn&amp;#39;t get prepared and all of a</text>
  <text start="308.28" dur="5.07">sudden everything starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="310.2" dur="6.66">and you&amp;#39;re not prepared at all for what</text>

  <text start="335.37" dur="4.46">funds put it into gold and guess what</text>
  <text start="338.009" dur="4.801">gold is gonna rise very very quickly</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="4.42">people are gonna run to the market get</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="3.02">whatever they possibly can because all</text>
  <text start="344.25" dur="4.59">of a sudden we&amp;#39;re gonna see inflation</text>
  <text start="345.83" dur="4.36">and as the market comes down people are</text>
  <text start="348.84" dur="3.389">gonna be very upset people gonna be</text>

  <text start="366.75" dur="5.909">quickly came down we can see that it</text>
  <text start="369.599" dur="5.011">does happen very very fast now the banks</text>
  <text start="372.659" dur="4.26">are reporting that they have a weaker</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="4.08">demand for auto loans and residential</text>
  <text start="376.919" dur="4.771">mortgages we know that interest rates</text>
  <text start="378.69" dur="6.81">are pushing up right now and we</text>
  <text start="381.69" dur="5.88">understand that the everyday person well</text>
  <text start="385.5" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re tapped out the everyday person</text>
  <text start="387.57" dur="4.409">they&amp;#39;re losing their jobs a hundred</text>
  <text start="389.61" dur="4.5">thousand jobs are going to be lost in</text>
  <text start="391.979" dur="4.351">the retail industry and believe me the</text>
  <text start="394.11" dur="5.52">online industry is not taking up the</text>
  <text start="396.33" dur="5.76">slack and there&amp;#39;s a lot of commercial</text>
  <text start="399.63" dur="4.83">real estate out there there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="402.09" dur="4.23">debt that is due we&amp;#39;re adding more and</text>
  <text start="404.46" dur="4.41">more debt actually the US Treasury set</text>
  <text start="406.32" dur="5.189">to borrow nearly 1 trillion dollars this</text>
  <text start="408.87" dur="6.51">year and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now it</text>
  <text start="411.509" dur="6.9">has not led up at all governments around</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="4.86">the world have to continually take on</text>
  <text start="418.409" dur="4.651">more and more debt to keep everything</text>
  <text start="420.24" dur="5.609">operational and that debt the debt is</text>
  <text start="423.06" dur="6.389">not decreasing it&amp;#39;s increasing rapidly</text>
  <text start="425.849" dur="7.831">and you know as you increase the debt</text>
  <text start="429.449" dur="6.511">and there&amp;#39;s less tax money coming into</text>
  <text start="433.68" dur="4.53">the government there&amp;#39;s less funding of</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="5.609">the government as the interest rates go</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="5.579">up as the debt goes up it it completely</text>
  <text start="441.569" dur="4.951">cannot be sustained and this is what</text>
  <text start="443.789" dur="6.091">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now this system is</text>
  <text start="446.52" dur="5.699">falling apart even with the tax cuts and</text>
  <text start="449.88" dur="5.07">everything like this it&amp;#39;s actually go to</text>
  <text start="452.219" dur="4.681">make it even worse in the long run yes</text>
  <text start="454.95" dur="4.65">the short-run we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot</text>
  <text start="456.9" dur="4.74">of funds come into the country and this</text>
  <text start="459.6" dur="4.5">is being done on purpose to prepare us</text>
  <text start="461.64" dur="4.83">for the transition because what do we</text>
  <text start="464.1" dur="5.28">need for the transition think about it</text>
  <text start="466.47" dur="7.37">we need to bring the currency back here</text>
  <text start="469.38" dur="9.89">to the US so corporations can create and</text>
  <text start="473.84" dur="8.83">build their infrastructure for the new</text>
  <text start="479.27" dur="5.89">currency system we need manufacturing</text>
  <text start="482.67" dur="4.44">back in this country if we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="485.16" dur="3.48">have manufacturing back in this country</text>
  <text start="487.11" dur="5.4">maybe it&amp;#39;s not the same manufacturing we</text>
  <text start="488.64" dur="4.83">had back in the 40s 50s 60s 70s yes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="492.51" dur="3.62">going to change a little bit</text>
  <text start="493.47" dur="6.18">we need eight different infrastructure</text>
  <text start="496.13" dur="5.29">if we&amp;#39;re going to join the one belt one</text>
  <text start="499.65" dur="4.44">Road which I believe we&amp;#39;re going to join</text>
  <text start="501.42" dur="4.35">I think NAFTA is out the door here I</text>
  <text start="504.09" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re gonna come to any</text>
  <text start="505.77" dur="4.08">type of an agreement we don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="507.78" dur="4.98">TPP we don&amp;#39;t have any of that stuff</text>
  <text start="509.85" dur="6.78">we&amp;#39;re not gonna be the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="5.88">of the world anymore so we need to build</text>
  <text start="516.63" dur="3.72">our infrastructure completely different</text>
  <text start="518.64" dur="5.31">actually it&amp;#39;s crumbling to pieces right</text>
  <text start="520.35" dur="6.66">now and we need to build it once again</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="6.72">in a different fashion to be in line</text>
  <text start="527.01" dur="6.33">with the new trade system we&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="530.67" dur="5.07">into a new currency most likely the US</text>
  <text start="533.34" dur="5.34">will not be the reserve currency of the</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="5.04">world and we can see right now that all</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="5.37">of this is being done preparing the</text>
  <text start="540.78" dur="6.09">United States for this new type of</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="4.98">system and to get to this new type of</text>
  <text start="546.87" dur="4.56">system we&amp;#39;re gonna have to go through a</text>
  <text start="549.03" dur="4.79">little pain just like everything else</text>
  <text start="551.43" dur="4.59">when people go through bankruptcy when</text>
  <text start="553.82" dur="4.84">something closes and something else</text>
  <text start="556.02" dur="5.28">opens up there&amp;#39;s always this small</text>
  <text start="558.66" dur="5.07">portion of pain that people have to go</text>
  <text start="561.3" dur="6.72">through now the pain can be severe or</text>
  <text start="563.73" dur="7.29">the pain can be minimal and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="568.02" dur="5.55">hoping for is a minimal type of pain</text>
  <text start="571.02" dur="5.76">going through this transition now the</text>
  <text start="573.57" dur="5.58">Cabal the central banking system they</text>
  <text start="576.78" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t really care the central banking</text>
  <text start="579.15" dur="4.92">system of course they just want their</text>
  <text start="581.4" dur="4.74">new system to come online that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="584.07" dur="4.06">they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="586.14" dur="4.15">have a new system</text>
  <text start="588.13" dur="4.17">they want control of the currency they</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t want people using crypto</text>
  <text start="592.3" dur="3.84">currencies that they don&amp;#39;t have control</text>
  <text start="593.98" dur="4.53">over and they don&amp;#39;t care if the system</text>
  <text start="596.14" dur="5.31">comes down hard makes no difference to</text>
  <text start="598.51" dur="4.86">them because they&amp;#39;re creating the</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="3.81">currency they&amp;#39;re always in control and</text>
  <text start="603.37" dur="3.36">they don&amp;#39;t care how many people get</text>
  <text start="605.26" dur="3.36">wiped out it makes no difference to them</text>
  <text start="606.73" dur="3.72">on the other hand the Trump</text>
  <text start="608.62" dur="3.48">administration those individuals that</text>
  <text start="610.45" dur="5.28">are in government right now are trying</text>
  <text start="612.1" dur="6.12">to prepare the entire country for this</text>
  <text start="615.73" dur="4.41">soft transition into the new system it</text>
  <text start="618.22" dur="5.37">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that everything&amp;#39;s gonna go</text>
  <text start="620.14" dur="5.94">well everything&amp;#39;s going to be easy</text>
  <text start="623.59" dur="4.38">think about the 70s we were the reserve</text>
  <text start="626.08" dur="4.74">currency were backed by gold we had a</text>
  <text start="627.97" dur="5.6">very little bit of debt at that time we</text>
  <text start="630.82" dur="5.88">went on to a new system the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="633.57" dur="4.99">pretty much the same dollar as it was</text>
  <text start="636.7" dur="5.34">before but it just wasn&amp;#39;t backed by gold</text>

  <text start="738.52" dur="6.72">a central bank currency run system this</text>
  <text start="741.58" dur="5.61">is the big question and once again you</text>
  <text start="745.24" dur="4.71">need to be prepared for this how do you</text>
  <text start="747.19" dur="5.01">weather the storm how do you survive</text>
  <text start="749.95" dur="4.08">this well think about those individuals</text>
  <text start="752.2" dur="4.62">that were in the Great Depression at the</text>
  <text start="754.03" dur="5.79">time those individuals that held on to</text>
  <text start="756.82" dur="6.62">their gold it was worth what $20 an</text>
  <text start="759.82" dur="7.5">ounce and when the government basically</text>
  <text start="763.44" dur="7.09">repriced gold it was $35 an ounce so</text>
  <text start="767.32" dur="5.48">they had 20 and back then that was quite</text>
  <text start="770.53" dur="5.43">a bit of money and it was repriced to</text>
  <text start="772.8" dur="8.26">$35 an ounce guess what if they had</text>
  <text start="775.96" dur="8.31">maybe 10 ounces 5 ounces whatever it was</text>

  <text start="786.88" dur="5.55">purchased it at 1400 maybe purchase at</text>
  <text start="788.98" dur="5.79">1100 when it is re priced guess what it</text>
  <text start="792.43" dur="4.32">will be repriced to the new currency</text>
  <text start="794.77" dur="4.29">remember the precious metals market has</text>
  <text start="796.75" dur="3.27">been manipulated it&amp;#39;s been suppressed on</text>
  <text start="799.06" dur="3.54">purpose</text>
  <text start="800.02" dur="5.07">to make everyone stay away from the</text>
  <text start="802.6" dur="4.23">precious metals Morgan Kryptos are going</text>
  <text start="805.09" dur="3.75">to also be reprised yes we see them</text>

  <text start="812.29" dur="4.47">doing we&amp;#39;re gonna go through this</text>
  <text start="814.54" dur="3.65">transition and you need to be ready and</text>
  <text start="816.76" dur="3.96">prepared and when we see inflation</text>
  <text start="818.19" dur="4.81">hyperinflation and when credit starts to</text>
  <text start="820.72" dur="3.99">freeze up because what is happening here</text>
  <text start="823" dur="3.81">you need to have food you need to have</text>
  <text start="824.71" dur="3.66">supplies you need to be ready so you</text>
  <text start="826.81" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t run to the market so you&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="833.77" dur="4.71">gonna be pushing people out of the way</text>
  <text start="835.24" dur="5.67">to get their stuff now as we watch this</text>
  <text start="838.48" dur="4.41">we need to keep an eye on gold we need</text>
  <text start="840.91" dur="5.28">to watch crypto market we need to watch</text>
  <text start="842.89" dur="6.9">the VIX right now after the market is</text>

  <text start="854.279" dur="6.451">and we can see right now that this is</text>
  <text start="856.379" dur="6.931">not a good sign so we need to watch this</text>
  <text start="860.73" dur="4.019">very very carefully many individuals</text>
  <text start="863.31" dur="5.61">were saying this was looking a lot like</text>
  <text start="864.749" dur="7.2">2008 or 1987 and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="868.92" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;re in this period of time where we</text>
  <text start="871.949" dur="5.671">need to be ready and prepared and we</text>
  <text start="874.62" dur="5.029">need to make sure that we are ready for</text>

  <text start="902.61" dur="2.729">no difference to me</text>
  <text start="903.389" dur="5.221">but what happens here if you&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="905.339" dur="6.511">for a corporation or a company that is</text>
  <text start="908.61" dur="6.329">in the market a lot of times they use</text>
  <text start="911.85" dur="5.669">this as an excuse to start to lay off</text>
  <text start="914.939" dur="4.77">individuals remember these companies</text>

  <text start="924.089" dur="5.31">use this to start to cut costs to start</text>
  <text start="926.49" dur="6.24">to restructure as they like to call it</text>
  <text start="929.399" dur="5.581">their entire company and they shrink</text>
  <text start="932.73" dur="4.68">their companies and they use this as an</text>

  <text start="937.41" dur="3.84">a lot of people affected by this and</text>
  <text start="939.36" dur="4.32">this is normally the red flare that is</text>
