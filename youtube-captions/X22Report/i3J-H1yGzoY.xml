  <text start="134.8" dur="7.26">been saying that Trump his entire push</text>
  <text start="138.7" dur="5.94">is to get to the source of the entire</text>
  <text start="142.06" dur="5.009">problem and that is the central bank and</text>

  <text start="447.91" dur="4.77">and it&amp;#39;s falling apart rapidly they knew</text>
  <text start="449.979" dur="4.44">that they only had a window of time</text>
  <text start="452.68" dur="3.63">before everything started to fall</text>
  <text start="454.419" dur="4.141">now we&amp;#39;ve been talking about retail how</text>
  <text start="456.31" dur="4.38">retail was a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="458.56" dur="5.039">now we talked about this way before the</text>
  <text start="460.69" dur="4.53">retail apocalypse but this is continuing</text>
  <text start="463.599" dur="3.181">and it&amp;#39;s not because everyone&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="465.22" dur="3.629">online and purchasing everything online</text>
  <text start="466.78" dur="4.919">because that would be a one-to-one ratio</text>
  <text start="468.849" dur="5.491">or very very close where it&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="471.699" dur="4.59">close to it but what we&amp;#39;re seeing what</text>
  <text start="474.34" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re seeing happen right now there are</text>
  <text start="476.289" dur="5.91">more retailers that might go bankrupt</text>
  <text start="480.19" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re very very close to this and</text>
  <text start="482.199" dur="7.051">using the credit risk monitor there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="485.47" dur="5.819">gauge here it&amp;#39;s a frisk score and it</text>
  <text start="489.25" dur="3.72">indicates at nine point nine percent to</text>
  <text start="491.289" dur="4.171">fifty percent chance of bankers</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="3.93">bankruptcy and 12 months and when we</text>
  <text start="495.46" dur="3.87">look at this we can see there are</text>
  <text start="496.9" dur="5.519">certain stores that are showing that</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="4.98">they have this score and they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="502.419" dur="5.131">close to bankruptcy a lot of these</text>
  <text start="504.31" dur="5.19">stores have kind of gotten around</text>
  <text start="507.55" dur="4.979">bankruptcy by doing some you know</text>
  <text start="509.5" dur="5.94">manipulation some fancy financial work</text>

  <text start="629.61" dur="4.26">for a month or two but what happens is</text>
  <text start="631.95" dur="3.06">later on you see the delinquents you</text>
  <text start="633.87" dur="3">start to rise because they really</text>
  <text start="635.01" dur="4.68">couldn&amp;#39;t afford this and this is what we</text>
  <text start="636.87" dur="5.219">are seeing in the automobile industry we</text>
  <text start="639.69" dur="6">see delinquencies they&amp;#39;re in there</text>
  <text start="642.089" dur="5.961">they&amp;#39;re moving up they&amp;#39;re rising and car</text>
  <text start="645.69" dur="5.459">sales right now they are tumbling</text>
  <text start="648.05" dur="5.56">remember we talked about channel</text>
  <text start="651.149" dur="4.801">stuffing how the American automobile</text>
  <text start="653.61" dur="5.04">makers they were stuffing the cars on</text>
  <text start="655.95" dur="5.07">the Lots that was considered a sale not</text>
  <text start="658.65" dur="6.03">when you sell a car to someone when you</text>
  <text start="661.02" dur="5.37">actually bring the car to the dealer if</text>
  <text start="664.68" dur="5.37">you bring a lot of cars to the dealer</text>
  <text start="666.39" dur="5.1">those are considered sales all these</text>
  <text start="670.05" dur="4.65">numbers are manipulated one way or</text>
  <text start="671.49" dur="5.91">another and we&amp;#39;re looking at the major</text>
  <text start="674.7" dur="6.27">manufacturers they reported a sharp drop</text>
  <text start="677.4" dur="6.809">in US deliveries for July led by a 15</text>
  <text start="680.97" dur="4.95">percent plunge at Nissan Motors now they</text>
  <text start="684.209" dur="3.511">have their reasons that they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="685.92" dur="3.18">out there of why this is happening but</text>
  <text start="687.72" dur="4.22">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this and this is why</text>
  <text start="689.1" dur="5.97">we bring up all these important parts of</text>
  <text start="691.94" dur="5.5">how the automobile Channel stuff lots</text>
  <text start="695.07" dur="5.22">remember these sales were never real</text>
  <text start="697.44" dur="5.519">they allowed people to come in with</text>
  <text start="700.29" dur="6.06">subprime credit and then sub subprime</text>
  <text start="702.959" dur="4.981">credit just to move the merchandise to</text>
  <text start="706.35" dur="4.29">make it look like things are on the</text>
  <text start="707.94" dur="5.13">up-and-up now they&amp;#39;re saying well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="710.64" dur="5.22">happening because of the auto tariffs</text>
  <text start="713.07" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s happening because what Trump is</text>
  <text start="715.86" dur="5.01">doing this is the excuse that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="717.66" dur="4.41">using General Motors their sales have</text>
  <text start="720.87" dur="5.07">fallen to 3</text>
  <text start="722.07" dur="5.91">3% last month the same drop as Ford and</text>
  <text start="725.94" dur="4.38">when we look at this entire situation</text>
  <text start="727.98" dur="4.23">and as we move forward with all these</text>
  <text start="730.32" dur="3.42">retailers closing because we have the</text>
  <text start="732.21" dur="3.6">corporate offices we have the stores</text>
  <text start="733.74" dur="3.81">these individuals are not going to be</text>
  <text start="735.81" dur="3.48">going out purchasing cars and think</text>
  <text start="737.55" dur="4.8">about how many stores how many employees</text>
  <text start="739.29" dur="6.57">have been laid off some are full-time</text>
  <text start="742.35" dur="6">some are part-time and once again if</text>
  <text start="745.86" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re working part-time and you weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="748.35" dur="3.33">working a certain number of hours or</text>
  <text start="749.79" dur="3.93">getting a certain number pay you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="751.68" dur="3.84">counted as being laid off but on the</text>
  <text start="753.72" dur="4.26">flip side if you got a part-time job</text>
  <text start="755.52" dur="4.56">they counted you as a full-time worker</text>
  <text start="757.98" dur="5.64">if you had two part-time jobs you had</text>
  <text start="760.08" dur="5.37">two full-time jobs and that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="763.62" dur="4.65">counted you so you can see how this is</text>
  <text start="765.45" dur="5.48">all manipulated to make you think that</text>
  <text start="768.27" dur="6.39">things are going very well we see that</text>
  <text start="770.93" dur="5.79">durable goods they were revised and they</text>
  <text start="774.66" dur="4.44">said durable goods were up percent we</text>
  <text start="776.72" dur="4.18">showed that no that was military</text>
  <text start="779.1" dur="3.5">spending they were actually down but</text>
  <text start="780.9" dur="6.63">they even lowered them now to 0.8%</text>
  <text start="782.6" dur="6.37">including the military spending and we</text>
  <text start="787.53" dur="3.48">see already that the durable goods these</text>
  <text start="788.97" dur="4.02">are the big ticket items like washers</text>
  <text start="791.01" dur="4.44">dryers and things like that people are</text>
  <text start="792.99" dur="4.47">not going out and purchasing these items</text>
  <text start="795.45" dur="4.2">so when we look at the economy as a</text>
  <text start="797.46" dur="6.33">whole right now in the United States in</text>
  <text start="799.65" dur="5.64">Canada in Europe in Australia we see</text>
  <text start="803.79" dur="4.08">everything starting to fall apart now</text>
  <text start="805.29" dur="4.5">people are starting to take notice now I</text>
  <text start="807.87" dur="5.13">mean before no one realized what was</text>
  <text start="809.79" dur="4.95">going on you know oh you hear that the</text>
  <text start="813" dur="3.24">economy is not doing well but the</text>
  <text start="814.74" dur="3.99">statistical numbers they show that they</text>
  <text start="816.24" dur="4.44">they are doing well now people are</text>
  <text start="818.73" dur="3.69">starting to realize there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="820.68" dur="3.6">wrong many individuals are saying that</text>
  <text start="822.42" dur="4.8">business is starting to slow down now</text>
  <text start="824.28" dur="4.95">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this in many</text>
  <text start="827.22" dur="4.62">different areas now of course the</text>
  <text start="829.23" dur="4.92">corporate media is getting on to this</text>
  <text start="831.84" dur="5.25">saying that housing is starting to slow</text>
  <text start="834.15" dur="4.44">and they have a different agenda they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="837.09" dur="3.75">saying this is all because of Trump know</text>
  <text start="838.59" dur="5.28">what&amp;#39;s happening is we&amp;#39;re coming to the</text>
  <text start="840.84" dur="4.56">end of the central banking system they</text>
  <text start="843.87" dur="3.66">propped it up for a little while longer</text>
  <text start="845.4" dur="3.54">but they were expecting someone else in</text>
  <text start="847.53" dur="4.2">the White House and they were going to</text>
  <text start="848.94" dur="5.25">bring us to war or have some type of an</text>
  <text start="851.73" dur="3.29">event to explain away why all this is</text>
  <text start="854.19" dur="4.7">happening</text>
  <text start="855.02" dur="5.19">problem is they can&amp;#39;t do it now so we</text>
  <text start="858.89" dur="4.95">have Trump with the Patriots in the</text>
  <text start="860.21" dur="5.19">White House and the plan right now is to</text>
  <text start="863.84" dur="5.58">take over the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="865.4" dur="6.99">eventually get rid of it or control it</text>
  <text start="869.42" dur="5.28">and have we the people control it create</text>
  <text start="872.39" dur="6.81">the currency without interest and maybe</text>
  <text start="874.7" dur="8.25">eventually get rid of it so what is the</text>
  <text start="879.2" dur="4.86">plan what is the plan here well the</text>
  <text start="882.95" dur="3.75">Board of Governors of the Federal</text>
  <text start="884.06" dur="5.21">Reserve is required to have seven</text>
  <text start="886.7" dur="5.94">members how many does it have right now</text>
  <text start="889.27" dur="6.43">three two of the current governors who</text>
  <text start="892.64" dur="4.47">are put into their position by Trump two</text>
  <text start="895.7" dur="3.36">more have been nominated by the</text>
  <text start="897.11" dur="5.1">president and our awaiting confirmation</text>
  <text start="899.06" dur="4.95">by the Senate after these two are put on</text>
  <text start="902.21" dur="3.99">the Fed board the president will then</text>
  <text start="904.01" dur="4.77">nominate two more to follow them in</text>
  <text start="906.2" dur="5.13">essence it is possible that six of the</text>
  <text start="908.78" dur="8.25">seven board members will be put in place</text>
  <text start="911.33" dur="8.64">by Trump now the president can and will</text>
  <text start="917.03" dur="4.34">take control of the Fed it may be</text>
  <text start="919.97" dur="3.54">recalled when the law was written</text>
  <text start="921.37" dur="5.17">creating the Federal Reserve the</text>
  <text start="923.51" dur="6.15">secretary of the Treasury was designated</text>
  <text start="926.54" dur="7.11">as the head of the Federal Reserve we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="929.66" dur="7.88">going to return to that error returning</text>
  <text start="933.65" dur="6.78">the Fed to the Treasury control means</text>
  <text start="937.54" dur="6.22">more than appointing new board members</text>
  <text start="940.43" dur="7.98">it means nationalizing the central bank</text>
  <text start="943.76" dur="6.75">making it a public utility responsive to</text>
  <text start="948.41" dur="4.71">the needs of the public and the economy</text>
  <text start="950.51" dur="5.13">and that means modifying the Federal</text>
  <text start="953.12" dur="5.88">Reserve Act to change the feds mandate</text>
  <text start="955.64" dur="6.92">and tools now there were certain</text>
  <text start="959" dur="7.53">presidents that attempted to do this</text>
  <text start="962.56" dur="6.55">John Kennedy Abraham Lincoln and two</text>
  <text start="966.53" dur="6.48">other assassinated President James</text>
  <text start="969.11" dur="7.08">Garfield William McKinley prior to Nixon</text>
  <text start="973.01" dur="5.1">had actively contemplated changes of</text>
  <text start="976.19" dur="5.88">such magnitude in the US financial</text>
  <text start="978.11" dur="6.33">system President Garfield observed that</text>
  <text start="982.07" dur="5.25">whoever controls the volume of money in</text>
  <text start="984.44" dur="3.39">our country is absolute master of all</text>
  <text start="987.32" dur="3.03">industry</text>
  <text start="987.83" dur="5.46">and commerce and when you realize that</text>
  <text start="990.35" dur="6.39">the entire money system is very easily</text>
  <text start="993.29" dur="6.09">controlled one way or another by a few</text>
  <text start="996.74" dur="5.25">powerful men you will not have to be</text>
  <text start="999.38" dur="6.69">told how periods of inflation and</text>
  <text start="1001.99" dur="6.3">depression originate and again the</text>
  <text start="1006.07" dur="4.05">central bankers they play dirty they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1008.29" dur="3.39">not just gonna let it happen it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1010.12" dur="4.83">going to be easy as we can see in the</text>
  <text start="1011.68" dur="5.79">past we had John F Kennedy he issued a</text>
  <text start="1014.95" dur="6.11">silver certificate put it out there</text>
  <text start="1017.47" dur="6.93">Abraham Lincoln issued the greenback and</text>
  <text start="1021.06" dur="5.71">anyone that attempts to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="1024.4" dur="6.24">central bank well it usually doesn&amp;#39;t end</text>
  <text start="1026.77" dur="6.93">well for them so we see at this point</text>
  <text start="1030.64" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re headed in this direction and this</text>
  <text start="1033.7" dur="3.99">was the plan from the very beginning</text>
  <text start="1035.32" dur="5.25">because you need to cut off the funding</text>
  <text start="1037.69" dur="6.06">to the deep state the root of all of</text>
  <text start="1040.57" dur="4.41">this is the central bank now yes there</text>
  <text start="1043.75" dur="4.11">are many different central banks there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1044.98" dur="6.09">the ECB there&amp;#39;s the Fed but we need to</text>
  <text start="1047.86" dur="6.18">get to the top the central bank of</text>
  <text start="1051.07" dur="4.89">central banks the biz but you need to</text>
  <text start="1054.04" dur="3.6">start somewhere and you need to work</text>
  <text start="1055.96" dur="4.41">your way up and you need to show other</text>
  <text start="1057.64" dur="4.91">countries what you need to do and once</text>
  <text start="1060.37" dur="4.8">you start doing this in all countries</text>
  <text start="1062.55" dur="4.36">band together and say you know something</text>
  <text start="1065.17" dur="3.93">we don&amp;#39;t need these central banks we</text>
  <text start="1066.91" dur="5.01">will control the creation of currency</text>
  <text start="1069.1" dur="4.89">well what is the central bank of all</text>
  <text start="1071.92" dur="3.69">central bank&amp;#39;s going to do they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1073.99" dur="5.25">have any power then over the governments</text>
  <text start="1075.61" dur="7.74">because they&amp;#39;re not in debt we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="1079.24" dur="6.81">in that direction this is the plan and I</text>
  <text start="1083.35" dur="6.87">do believe there will be an audit bill I</text>
  <text start="1086.05" dur="7.32">believe that Trump will then pass that</text>
  <text start="1090.22" dur="8.58">bill and the narrative right now is</text>
  <text start="1093.37" dur="7.56">being constructed and pushed to blame</text>
  <text start="1098.8" dur="3.72">this on the Fed now of course the Fed</text>
  <text start="1100.93" dur="3.06">has other plans because the central</text>
  <text start="1102.52" dur="3.45">bankers they&amp;#39;ve just don&amp;#39;t like to give</text>
  <text start="1103.99" dur="4.02">up control they&amp;#39;re creating their own</text>
  <text start="1105.97" dur="4.26">narrative and this is what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1108.01" dur="4.26">to see the battle for the narrative has</text>
  <text start="1110.23" dur="4.62">just begun it&amp;#39;s going to get worse</text>
  <text start="1112.27" dur="4.56">before it gets better and we can see</text>
  <text start="1114.85" dur="4.47">that we are headed in this direction</text>
  <text start="1116.83" dur="4.319">just like everything else it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1119.32" dur="4.079">happen with the snap of a finger</text>
  <text start="1121.149" dur="4.41">you have to be strategic you have to</text>
  <text start="1123.399" dur="5.041">work in a certain direction just like</text>
  <text start="1125.559" dur="5.58">everything else we&amp;#39;re seeing but slowly</text>
  <text start="1128.44" dur="4.169">but surely we&amp;#39;re going to see it happen</text>
  <text start="1131.139" dur="3.9">and this is why you need to be ready and</text>
  <text start="1132.609" dur="5.221">prepared because once we go into this</text>
  <text start="1135.039" dur="5.97">transition mode things are going to be a</text>
  <text start="1137.83" dur="4.649">little crazy in the beginning in 1971</text>
  <text start="1141.009" dur="3.441">when we were transitioning into the</text>
  <text start="1142.479" dur="5.07">petrodollar coming off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="1144.45" dur="4.929">people got hurt people didn&amp;#39;t have jobs</text>
  <text start="1147.549" dur="3.51">people couldn&amp;#39;t get fuel</text>
  <text start="1149.379" dur="5.85">there were blackouts in other countries</text>
  <text start="1151.059" dur="6.6">and we&amp;#39;re going to see something like</text>
  <text start="1155.229" dur="4.2">that actually probably a little bit</text>
  <text start="1157.659" dur="3.21">worse because most likely we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1159.429" dur="3.99">going to be the reserve currency anymore</text>
  <text start="1160.869" dur="4.62">and we&amp;#39;re not coming off a gold standard</text>
  <text start="1163.419" dur="3.661">we&amp;#39;re going the opposite way we have all</text>
  <text start="1165.489" dur="3.451">this debt we have everything based on</text>
  <text start="1167.08" dur="5.099">the central bank system and we need to</text>
  <text start="1168.94" dur="4.799">reverse it and that&amp;#39;s gonna go through a</text>
  <text start="1172.179" dur="3.66">little bit of a paint a little bit of</text>
  <text start="1173.739" dur="3.93">pain for many many people and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1175.839" dur="4.56">gonna need to be prepared and ready for</text>
  <text start="1177.669" dur="4.651">this pain they&amp;#39;re gonna try to make it</text>
  <text start="1180.399" dur="4.86">as easy as possible but there will be</text>
