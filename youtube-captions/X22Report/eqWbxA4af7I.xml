  <text start="65.449" dur="5.701">is those in government just revealed</text>
  <text start="68" dur="5.13">their true agenda let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.15" dur="4.74">economic collapse political NGO</text>
  <text start="73.13" dur="5.94">political news now as we know Trump and</text>
  <text start="75.89" dur="7.58">Paul Ryan they were trying to push the</text>
  <text start="79.07" dur="7.77">American healthcare act and we see that</text>
  <text start="83.47" dur="6.13">everyone wants to rewrite health care</text>
  <text start="86.84" dur="3.6">and we can see that the Senate they said</text>
  <text start="89.6" dur="3.75">they were going to write their own</text>
  <text start="90.44" dur="4.74">health care bill and they released it</text>
  <text start="93.35" dur="4.11">today Majority Leader Mitch McConnell</text>
  <text start="95.18" dur="5.52">released a draft of the Senate&amp;#39;s health</text>
  <text start="97.46" dur="6.36">care reform bill and basically they took</text>
  <text start="100.7" dur="5.97">what was already there they massaged it</text>
  <text start="103.82" dur="6.39">made it sound a lot better and they made</text>
  <text start="106.67" dur="5.94">certain groups happy other groups angry</text>
  <text start="110.21" dur="4.65">and we can see right now that nobody</text>
  <text start="112.61" dur="4.02">liked the tax part of it the penalty as</text>
  <text start="114.86" dur="4.29">we should call it so they got rid of</text>
  <text start="116.63" dur="5.07">that and they did a lot of other things</text>
  <text start="119.15" dur="5.82">where they said see we have a better</text>
  <text start="121.7" dur="5.58">health care bill now Rand Paul was out</text>
  <text start="124.97" dur="5.429">there and he&amp;#39;s saying that the current</text>
  <text start="127.28" dur="6.12">health care bill well it doesn&amp;#39;t repeal</text>
  <text start="130.399" dur="5.31">Obamacare it does not keep our promises</text>
  <text start="133.4" dur="5.25">to the American people he says I will</text>
  <text start="135.709" dur="6.211">oppose this new bill coming to the floor</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="6.44">in its current form but I remain open to</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="6.12">negotiations and we can see once again</text>
  <text start="145.09" dur="4.75">these bills that all these government</text>
  <text start="148.04" dur="5.07">officials are coming up with they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="149.84" dur="5.7">a real benefit to the majority of the</text>
  <text start="153.11" dur="4.86">people yes there are certain groups in</text>
  <text start="155.54" dur="4.229">there that ooh this is good for me and</text>
  <text start="157.97" dur="3.87">then the rest of the people well this is</text>
  <text start="159.769" dur="4.351">not that great for me because what is</text>
  <text start="161.84" dur="5.73">happening here is all these government</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="6.11">officials they&amp;#39;re writing it with the</text>
  <text start="167.57" dur="6.449">insurance companies and the insurance</text>
  <text start="170.23" dur="6.31">companies they have a certain agenda and</text>
  <text start="174.019" dur="5.641">of course it&amp;#39;s not to help the everyday</text>
  <text start="176.54" dur="5.1">person it&amp;#39;s to make themselves more and</text>
  <text start="179.66" dur="4.5">more profitable once they see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="181.64" dur="4.41">not profitable what do they do they back</text>
  <text start="184.16" dur="2.7">out of it now they thought with</text>
  <text start="186.05" dur="3.42">Obamacare</text>
  <text start="186.86" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;d be very very profitable because</text>
  <text start="189.47" dur="5.82">there should I say plan their scheme was</text>
  <text start="193.19" dur="4.65">to push everyone into health care that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="3.93">why they had the penalty because the</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="3.6">insurance company said the only way we</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="4.65">can make this work is we need everyone</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="4.53">in and we need everyone paying because</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="4.26">once we start rising the Preem raising</text>
  <text start="205.97" dur="4.05">the premiums what happens is we make a</text>
  <text start="208.13" dur="4.41">lot more money we have these gigantic</text>
  <text start="210.02" dur="4.26">deduct the gigantic deductibles and</text>
  <text start="212.54" dur="4.29">guess what we don&amp;#39;t have to pay out as</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="4.98">much this was their plan</text>
  <text start="216.83" dur="4.83">but people realize that I can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="219.26" dur="4.5">this the one thing they forgot was the</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="3.84">economy was deteriorating at the same</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="3.06">time even though they were trying to</text>
  <text start="225.5" dur="4.11">convince us that the economy was doing</text>
  <text start="226.82" dur="4.38">well and what happened was they realized</text>
  <text start="229.61" dur="3.81">a lot of people weren&amp;#39;t going for it</text>
  <text start="231.2" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;d rather take the penalty well it</text>
  <text start="233.42" dur="4.65">wasn&amp;#39;t profitable for them so they</text>
  <text start="235.28" dur="5.94">started to back out saying this is not</text>
  <text start="238.07" dur="6.03">for us we&amp;#39;re losing money with this</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="5.18">entire scheme you know the one that the</text>
  <text start="244.1" dur="6.24">insurance companies help right now</text>
  <text start="246.4" dur="5.53">they&amp;#39;re moving on to a new version of</text>
  <text start="250.34" dur="3.869">this and they just keep rewriting the</text>
  <text start="251.93" dur="5.13">same exact thing over and over and over</text>
  <text start="254.209" dur="5.131">making it make me try to sound good to</text>
  <text start="257.06" dur="4.89">the people how about if they take it</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="5.28">strip it down and they do it and make it</text>
  <text start="261.95" dur="3.6">beneficial to the people and let the</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="5.52">people decide</text>
  <text start="265.55" dur="6.51">does this help all of us and you will</text>
  <text start="270.14" dur="4.83">know right away because when you have a</text>
  <text start="272.06" dur="5.73">good product a good program people will</text>
  <text start="274.97" dur="6.03">flock to it people know when it&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="277.79" dur="6.03">or bad and when it&amp;#39;s bad they stay away</text>
  <text start="281" dur="5.61">from it just like Obamacare now we see</text>
  <text start="283.82" dur="4.44">that Trump came out and he confirmed</text>
  <text start="286.61" dur="5.07">that he did not make tapes of his</text>
  <text start="288.26" dur="6.06">conversations with Comey now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="291.68" dur="7.02">interesting about all this is he uses</text>
  <text start="294.32" dur="8.55">his words very carefully and what he</text>
  <text start="298.7" dur="6.63">said was that he did not make tapes with</text>
  <text start="302.87" dur="6.08">Comey he doesn&amp;#39;t know if these</text>
  <text start="305.33" dur="6.54">recordings even exist he does not have</text>
  <text start="308.95" dur="6.04">recordings which means he didn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="311.87" dur="6.57">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that someone else did it</text>
  <text start="314.99" dur="5.7">and this is what he said when Comey was</text>
  <text start="318.44" dur="5.04">out there test</text>
  <text start="320.69" dur="5.79">in front of Congress I think Trump used</text>
  <text start="323.48" dur="5.78">this to kind of force Co me into saying</text>
  <text start="326.48" dur="6.33">that he wasn&amp;#39;t under investigation and</text>
  <text start="329.26" dur="7.48">tried to keep him on track and telling</text>
  <text start="332.81" dur="6.57">the truth and when Trump was out there</text>
  <text start="336.74" dur="3.3">he didn&amp;#39;t say that he had the tapes he</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="3.6">didn&amp;#39;t say that</text>
  <text start="340.04" dur="6.08">I&amp;#39;m gonna present the tapes he says I</text>
  <text start="342.98" dur="5.73">hope there weren&amp;#39;t tapes made of our</text>
  <text start="346.12" dur="6.73">conversation here is the tweet that</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="6.78">Trump used James Comey better hope that</text>
  <text start="352.85" dur="5.21">there are no tapes of our conversations</text>
  <text start="355.49" dur="5.76">before he starts leaking to the press</text>
  <text start="358.06" dur="7.03">now he didn&amp;#39;t say that he made the tapes</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="7.32">he said he hopes that there are no tapes</text>
  <text start="365.09" dur="6.96">of the conversation now everyone read</text>
  <text start="368.57" dur="5.76">into this and they believed that he made</text>
  <text start="372.05" dur="4.14">the tapes of the conversation now we</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="5.01">know there are recordings of the</text>
  <text start="376.19" dur="6.72">conversation because we know for a fact</text>
  <text start="379.34" dur="5.97">that the NSA is spying Trump knows this</text>
  <text start="382.91" dur="4.83">he knows that all these are be all these</text>
  <text start="385.31" dur="4.68">conversations are being recorded and we</text>
  <text start="387.74" dur="5.22">can see that he uses these words and he</text>
  <text start="389.99" dur="5.1">plays on these words to basically play</text>
  <text start="392.96" dur="4.41">with the corporate media and to play</text>
  <text start="395.09" dur="5.46">with others and you can see this is what</text>
  <text start="397.37" dur="5.01">he&amp;#39;s been doing and at this point he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.55" dur="4.619">saying listen I don&amp;#39;t have the tapes</text>
  <text start="402.38" dur="5.31">I never made recordings he never said he</text>
  <text start="405.169" dur="3.571">did but it looks like he used this to</text>
  <text start="407.69" dur="4.5">his advantage</text>
  <text start="408.74" dur="6.06">now James Comey the FBI they are being</text>
  <text start="412.19" dur="5.04">sued and the plaintiffs are Dennis</text>
  <text start="414.8" dur="3.96">Montgomery a whistleblower who worked as</text>
  <text start="417.23" dur="4.2">a contractor for the National Security</text>
  <text start="418.76" dur="3.78">Agency the Central Intelligence Agency</text>
  <text start="421.43" dur="4.56">and the director of the National</text>
  <text start="422.54" dur="6.72">Intelligence his lawyer is Larry Clayman</text>
  <text start="425.99" dur="5.52">of Freedom Watch they filed in US</text>
  <text start="429.26" dur="5.52">District Court in Washington a motion</text>
  <text start="431.51" dur="5.61">for a temporary restraining order and a</text>
  <text start="434.78" dur="3.6">preliminary injunction they are asking</text>
  <text start="437.12" dur="3.39">the court to prevent the defendants</text>
  <text start="438.38" dur="4.74">including Comey the FBI and other</text>
  <text start="440.51" dur="5.34">federal officials mostly under the Obama</text>
  <text start="443.12" dur="5.549">administration from continuing illegally</text>
  <text start="445.85" dur="4.71">and unconstitutionally spying on and</text>
  <text start="448.669" dur="3.781">surveilling millions of Americans</text>
  <text start="450.56" dur="3.359">including plaintiffs without probable</text>
  <text start="452.45" dur="4.24">cause or warrant</text>
  <text start="453.919" dur="5.041">secondly they are asking the court to</text>
  <text start="456.69" dur="4.97">prevent the defendants from destroying</text>
  <text start="458.96" dur="5.89">evidence of illegal and unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="461.66" dur="6.31">spying that Montgomery turned over to</text>
  <text start="464.85" dur="6.319">Comey based on the promise that he was</text>
  <text start="467.97" dur="6.03">going to investigate all of this which</text>
  <text start="471.169" dur="5.201">basically call me didn&amp;#39;t do anything and</text>
  <text start="474" dur="5.01">we knew he wasn&amp;#39;t going to do anything</text>
  <text start="476.37" dur="5.25">because all of these agencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.01" dur="5.25">all involved in spying on the people</text>
  <text start="481.62" dur="5.34">spying on government officials spying on</text>
  <text start="484.26" dur="5.79">everyone using it to blackmail whoever</text>
  <text start="486.96" dur="5.76">they can now very interesting and we</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="6.77">mentioned this in past reports where</text>
  <text start="492.72" dur="7.4">these unmasking documents they moved to</text>
  <text start="496.82" dur="6.19">Obama&amp;#39;s library and they&amp;#39;re sealed but</text>
  <text start="500.12" dur="5.74">Judicial Watch president tom Fitton</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="6.629">he&amp;#39;s out there and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="7.2">Trump has the ability to get these</text>
  <text start="509.639" dur="6.21">documents by simply requesting them and</text>
  <text start="513.06" dur="5.01">I think at this point this is what Trump</text>
  <text start="515.849" dur="4.56">should do he should request them from</text>
  <text start="518.07" dur="4.589">the library but we know exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.409" dur="5.401">going to happen they will get misplaced</text>
  <text start="522.659" dur="6.241">they will get damaged and they will</text>
  <text start="525.81" dur="6.93">disappear if he does do this now I know</text>
  <text start="528.9" dur="6.09">it&amp;#39;s something that he can do but the</text>
  <text start="532.74" dur="5.13">question is if he does do it will we</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="5.34">ever see these records now US</text>
  <text start="537.87" dur="5.31">intelligence officials they have come</text>
  <text start="540.33" dur="6.27">out and they have said that there had</text>
  <text start="543.18" dur="6.029">been no votes changed because of Russia</text>
  <text start="546.6" dur="4.38">because remember the whole case was that</text>
  <text start="549.209" dur="4.38">Russia hacked the elections this is why</text>
  <text start="550.98" dur="5.76">Trump won now they&amp;#39;ve come out and said</text>
  <text start="553.589" dur="5.641">no we can&amp;#39;t find any evidence whatsoever</text>
  <text start="556.74" dur="5.34">that any of these votes have changed</text>
  <text start="559.23" dur="6.03">which means there was no Russian hacking</text>
  <text start="562.08" dur="6.84">nothing ever even happened this was</text>
  <text start="565.26" dur="6.84">created out of thin air to make everyone</text>
  <text start="568.92" dur="5.01">believe that this was what this was what</text>
  <text start="572.1" dur="3.359">was happening now of course Trump was</text>
  <text start="573.93" dur="3.72">out there and he was going crazy today</text>
  <text start="575.459" dur="3.991">about this and he was tweeting you know</text>
  <text start="577.65" dur="3.03">under Obama administration if they knew</text>
  <text start="579.45" dur="4.139">they were hacking why didn&amp;#39;t they stop</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="5.159">this why didn&amp;#39;t they do anything and of</text>
  <text start="583.589" dur="4.021">course basically they were going to use</text>
  <text start="585.839" dur="3.601">it to their advantage because</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="3.93">if they saw the popular vote remember</text>
  <text start="589.44" dur="4.889">it&amp;#39;s not the Electoral College it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="591.54" dur="4.71">popular vote who won the popular vote mo</text>
  <text start="594.329" dur="3.271">Clinton did well we know it was done</text>
  <text start="596.25" dur="3.3">illegally we know there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="597.6" dur="4.859">illegal immigrants that were brought in</text>
  <text start="599.55" dur="5.099">and that is why but let&amp;#39;s just go with</text>
  <text start="602.459" dur="3.63">the number where she won the popular</text>
  <text start="604.649" dur="3.391">vote which the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="606.089" dur="4.891">continually telling us that she did win</text>
  <text start="608.04" dur="6.479">this and we can see that they were going</text>
  <text start="610.98" dur="6.479">to use the run Russian hacking if Trump</text>
  <text start="614.519" dur="5.161">was leading in the popular vote if he</text>
  <text start="617.459" dur="4.651">was leading in the popular vote they</text>
  <text start="619.68" dur="6">would have used the Russian hacking case</text>
  <text start="622.11" dur="5.7">at that point saying that the entire</text>
  <text start="625.68" dur="4.409">election was being hacked they were</text>
  <text start="627.81" dur="4.32">prepared and ready to do this but it</text>
  <text start="630.089" dur="4.291">didn&amp;#39;t happen the opposite actually</text>
  <text start="632.13" dur="5.399">happened so they couldn&amp;#39;t really use it</text>
  <text start="634.38" dur="4.74">they used it afterwards but again it was</text>
  <text start="637.529" dur="3.3">meaningless at that point in time</text>
  <text start="639.12" dur="4.29">because the electoral college</text>
  <text start="640.829" dur="4.801">well they meet at a certain period of</text>
  <text start="643.41" dur="3.989">time at different times and they make</text>
  <text start="645.63" dur="4.38">their decision so Russia would never</text>
  <text start="647.399" dur="5.37">really have any type of control over</text>
  <text start="650.01" dur="6">those individuals now after their</text>
  <text start="652.769" dur="5.371">shooting of Scalise we see there are</text>
  <text start="656.01" dur="4.86">Republican lawmakers out there saying</text>
  <text start="658.14" dur="5.1">that you know government officials they</text>
  <text start="660.87" dur="3.06">should be able to carry a gun to protect</text>
  <text start="663.24" dur="2.43">themselves</text>
  <text start="663.93" dur="3.99">now think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="665.67" dur="4.109">celebrities politicians they have</text>
  <text start="667.92" dur="4.859">bodyguards these bodyguards carry</text>
  <text start="669.779" dur="5.781">weapons and here we have this shooting</text>
  <text start="672.779" dur="5.761">and now these different congressmen</text>
  <text start="675.56" dur="4.81">specifically congressman mo Brooks who</text>
  <text start="678.54" dur="4.08">survived the recent shooting in Virginia</text>
  <text start="680.37" dur="5.61">said that we should be allowed to carry</text>
  <text start="682.62" dur="6">weapons everywhere because we&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="685.98" dur="3.63">important well that means everyone</text>

  <text start="853.109" dur="4.691">where they grow the poppies</text>
  <text start="854.95" dur="6.09">where they sell it across the ocean to</text>
  <text start="857.8" dur="5.97">pay for their covert operations and we</text>
  <text start="861.04" dur="4.8">can see that they pump in a lot of funds</text>
  <text start="863.77" dur="4.68">from the US government and they take a</text>
  <text start="865.84" dur="5.64">lot of these funds for instance the</text>
  <text start="868.45" dur="5.28">Pentagon spent ninety three point eight</text>
  <text start="871.48" dur="5.61">million dollars over the past decade to</text>
  <text start="873.73" dur="6.66">provide Afghan troops with uniforms of a</text>
  <text start="877.09" dur="6.63">forest camouflage pattern which is</text>
  <text start="880.39" dur="6.06">largely unsuitable for Afghanistan&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="883.72" dur="5.79">landscape why would they spend all of</text>
  <text start="886.45" dur="5.7">this money the forests in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="889.51" dur="6.75">only covers 2.1 percent of the total</text>
  <text start="892.15" dur="6.87">land area so there was this report a 17</text>
  <text start="896.26" dur="4.8">page document and it further estimates</text>
  <text start="899.02" dur="4.14">that the Pentagon wasted up to 28</text>
  <text start="901.06" dur="4.8">million simply because it chose to buy</text>
  <text start="903.16" dur="5.34">the pattern from a private firm now</text>
  <text start="905.86" dur="4.65">remember all these funds going into</text>
  <text start="908.5" dur="3.81">Afghanistan to build these schools to</text>
  <text start="910.51" dur="4.29">build these highways none of this is</text>
  <text start="912.31" dur="6.21">being done all of this is being funneled</text>
  <text start="914.8" dur="7.23">off into different people&amp;#39;s pockets to</text>
  <text start="918.52" dur="5.88">pay for covert operations and if you</text>
  <text start="922.03" dur="3.87">believe the official story that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.4" dur="3.93">trying to win the battle against the</text>
  <text start="925.9" dur="6.48">Islamic state we can take everything</text>
  <text start="928.33" dur="6.99">that the u.s. spent in Afghanistan make</text>
  <text start="932.38" dur="4.86">up a list find out well the schools</text>
  <text start="935.32" dur="4.02">weren&amp;#39;t built the roads weren&amp;#39;t built</text>
  <text start="937.24" dur="4.05">the weapons that were sent to</text>
  <text start="939.34" dur="3.81">Afghanistan they disappeared the money</text>
  <text start="941.29" dur="4.8">that was sent to Afghanistan disappeared</text>
  <text start="943.15" dur="7.74">we&amp;#39;re buying camouflage uniforms for a</text>
  <text start="946.09" dur="7.62">desert type of landscape so 90 million</text>
  <text start="950.89" dur="5.7">dollars thrown out the window so if we</text>
  <text start="953.71" dur="5.73">go with their official story of why we</text>
  <text start="956.59" dur="6.6">can&amp;#39;t make any headway in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="959.44" dur="6.06">well it&amp;#39;s because the US government has</text>
  <text start="963.19" dur="5.1">no idea what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="965.5" dur="4.26">but we know that this is the real reason</text>
  <text start="968.29" dur="3.72">of course I&amp;#39;m a corporate media</text>
  <text start="969.76" dur="4.14">everywhere else they think you know yes</text>
  <text start="972.01" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;re fine we&amp;#39;re fighting the Taliban</text>
  <text start="973.9" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re fighting the Islamic state yes</text>
  <text start="976" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re trying to take control of</text>
  <text start="977.32" dur="3.96">Afghanistan now they just keep moving</text>
  <text start="979.54" dur="3.63">the terrorists around they never want</text>
  <text start="981.28" dur="4.89">this to end they love this a lot of</text>
  <text start="983.17" dur="4.95">money pours into it the real reason is</text>
  <text start="986.17" dur="2.58">because all these terrorist groups are</text>
  <text start="988.12" dur="3.6">funded</text>
  <text start="988.75" dur="5.76">these are paid mercenaries they never</text>
  <text start="991.72" dur="5.67">want to leave Afghanistan but we can see</text>
  <text start="994.51" dur="5.61">right now that all of this money that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="997.39" dur="6.78">being pumped into these different areas</text>
  <text start="1000.12" dur="7.95">like Iraq into Lebanon into Libya into</text>
  <text start="1004.17" dur="5.73">Sudan into Somalia into Syria most of</text>
  <text start="1008.07" dur="3.15">this completely disappears and a lot of</text>
  <text start="1009.9" dur="4.74">its funneled right into the paid</text>
  <text start="1011.22" dur="6.21">mercenaries now we see that poroshenko</text>
  <text start="1014.64" dur="5.37">is out there and he met with Trump he</text>
  <text start="1017.43" dur="5.58">met with pence and he&amp;#39;s out there saying</text>
  <text start="1020.01" dur="4.86">that Trump assured him that sanctions</text>
  <text start="1023.01" dur="5.699">against Russia will be maintained</text>
  <text start="1024.87" dur="5.16">now again according to poroshenko the</text>
  <text start="1028.709" dur="3.421">sanctions will remain until the</text>
  <text start="1030.03" dur="3.69">implementation of the Minsk agreements</text>
  <text start="1032.13" dur="2.97">now this really doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="1033.72" dur="4.38">because Tillerson was just out there</text>
  <text start="1035.1" dur="5.64">stating that they want to rework all</text>
  <text start="1038.1" dur="5.91">these sanctions and not have them linked</text>
  <text start="1040.74" dur="4.829">to the Minsk agreement so it looks like</text>
  <text start="1044.01" dur="3.87">poroshenko was just out there just</text>
  <text start="1045.569" dur="5.461">repeating everything from the past and</text>
  <text start="1047.88" dur="5.91">we can see the Trump administration they</text>
  <text start="1051.03" dur="5.55">want to soften the sanctions against</text>
  <text start="1053.79" dur="5.48">Russia but we can see that the Senate</text>
  <text start="1056.58" dur="5.79">they want more sanctions we can see the</text>
  <text start="1059.27" dur="5.5">Treasury secretary wants more sanctions</text>
  <text start="1062.37" dur="4.53">and we can see that the deep state they</text>
  <text start="1064.77" dur="3.54">still want to put a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="1066.9" dur="3.12">Russia you can see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1068.31" dur="3.99">around the globe with all these</text>
  <text start="1070.02" dur="5.79">provocations in the air where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1072.3" dur="5.7">trying to push the idea that Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1075.81" dur="4.5">being a very aggressive they&amp;#39;re flying</text>
  <text start="1078" dur="4.53">their planes very close to the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1080.31" dur="7.41">planes and they&amp;#39;re trying to make this</text>
  <text start="1082.53" dur="8.22">case now we know in the past the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1087.72" dur="5.43">fired a ballistic missile they</text>
  <text start="1090.75" dur="5.67">intercepted it to show North Korea</text>
  <text start="1093.15" dur="5.76">listen if you fire one at the US we can</text>
  <text start="1096.42" dur="5.73">shoot it down well we have a major</text>
  <text start="1098.91" dur="4.89">problem an interceptor missile fired</text>
  <text start="1102.15" dur="5.01">from the u.s. Navy destroyer off the</text>
  <text start="1103.8" dur="6.39">coast of Hawaii failed to hit the target</text>
  <text start="1107.16" dur="5.28">now the failure follows last month&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1110.19" dur="4.47">successful test where they knew exactly</text>
  <text start="1112.44" dur="4.68">what missile it was they knew the</text>
  <text start="1114.66" dur="3.9">trajectory they knew everything about it</text>
  <text start="1117.12" dur="4.29">and they were able to shoot it down and</text>
  <text start="1118.56" dur="4.17">we can see a medium-range ballistic</text>
  <text start="1121.41" dur="3.149">missile was fired from</text>
  <text start="1122.73" dur="4.74">the Pacific Missile Range facility in</text>
  <text start="1124.559" dur="5.701">Hawaii the destroyer the US has John</text>
  <text start="1127.47" dur="6.86">Paul Jones track the missile with its</text>
  <text start="1130.26" dur="7.89">onboard radar part of the Aegis baseline</text>
  <text start="1134.33" dur="6.76">system and basically completely missed</text>
  <text start="1138.15" dur="5.37">and they couldn&amp;#39;t hit the missile down</text>
  <text start="1141.09" dur="5.52">so we can see right now that things</text>
  <text start="1143.52" dur="6.93">aren&amp;#39;t going as well as everyone</text>
  <text start="1146.61" dur="7.59">believes because when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="1150.45" dur="6.93">see eight out of the 18 tests of the GM</text>

  <text start="1238.26" dur="8.1">to what North Korea is now we see</text>
  <text start="1242.07" dur="7.02">McCrone McCrone met with Putin and they</text>
  <text start="1246.36" dur="6.33">were discussing the terrorist groups</text>

  <text start="1256.38" dur="5.25">all the Western nations they realize</text>
  <text start="1258.72" dur="4.89">that there&amp;#39;s no way to get around this</text>
  <text start="1261.63" dur="4.32">this is why they don&amp;#39;t care about them</text>
  <text start="1263.61" dur="5.13">anymore this is why Makran is out there</text>
  <text start="1265.95" dur="5.1">saying yes Russia and France they should</text>
  <text start="1268.74" dur="3.57">work together to go after the terrorists</text>
  <text start="1271.05" dur="3.42">because they don&amp;#39;t need them right now</text>
  <text start="1272.31" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re in the process of splitting up</text>
  <text start="1274.47" dur="5.37">Syria that&amp;#39;s their main agenda right now</text>
  <text start="1277.59" dur="5.22">and we can see that he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="1279.84" dur="5.04">France well they would work with Russia</text>
  <text start="1282.81" dur="4.32">and help get the terrorists but the</text>
  <text start="1284.88" dur="4.98">problem is France is still involved with</text>
  <text start="1287.13" dur="5.31">the u.s. coalition and they would have</text>
  <text start="1289.86" dur="4.47">to maybe break off and work with Russia</text>
  <text start="1292.44" dur="3.75">because right now Russia is not working</text>
  <text start="1294.33" dur="4.29">with the coalition to go after the</text>
  <text start="1296.19" dur="5.6">terrorists so yes it&amp;#39;s great to say out</text>
  <text start="1298.62" dur="6.69">in public and it sounds fantastic but</text>
  <text start="1301.79" dur="7.18">let&amp;#39;s see the actions that we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1305.31" dur="6.81">seen and it sounds fantastic when both</text>
  <text start="1308.97" dur="5.66">leaders are talking now Russia is out</text>
  <text start="1312.12" dur="6.54">there and they are saying that it&amp;#39;s very</text>
