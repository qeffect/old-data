  <text start="224.38" dur="5.55">testimony is going to consists of the</text>
  <text start="227.98" dur="5.49">conservative Treehouse put this</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="5.459">information out details right now are</text>
  <text start="233.47" dur="4.26">beginning to emerge about the agreement</text>
  <text start="235.389" dur="5.041">between democrats and robert muller</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="6.39">surrounding his closely constructed</text>
  <text start="240.43" dur="6.179">upcoming testimony the baseline here is</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="4.14">very important as we have outline</text>
  <text start="246.609" dur="4.021">throughout and especially since the</text>
  <text start="248.26" dur="4.979">Democrats won the midterm election the</text>
  <text start="250.63" dur="6.18">Muller team is closely coordinated with</text>
  <text start="253.239" dur="6.93">Pelosi shift Nadler and Cummings this</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="6">entire group about how best to continue</text>
  <text start="260.169" dur="4.231">the efforts of the Weissman and Muller</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="5.37">small group within the Department of</text>
  <text start="264.4" dur="7.26">Justice and FBI now pay attention to how</text>
  <text start="268.18" dur="6.84">these are being structured to open</text>
  <text start="271.66" dur="6.18">sessions with limited questions and only</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="4.95">one opportunity for questions by each</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="4.32">member of the committee the House</text>
  <text start="279.97" dur="3.96">Judiciary Committee will have to choose</text>
  <text start="282.16" dur="5.15">which of its members are able to ask</text>
  <text start="283.93" dur="5.459">mother questions during its open session</text>
  <text start="287.31" dur="4.78">unlike the house permanent Select</text>
  <text start="289.389" dur="4.471">Committee on Intelligence the Judiciary</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="4.26">Committee is quite large almost double</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="4.95">in size so only 22</text>
  <text start="296.35" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s 41 members will be present for the</text>
  <text start="298.81" dur="5.25">open session the details of the argument</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="3.92">between the committee&amp;#39;s and Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.06" dur="4.77">office are still being worked out</text>
  <text start="305.85" dur="5.11">Judiciary Committee members who do not</text>
  <text start="308.83" dur="3.87">get to ask questions of Muller will</text>
  <text start="310.96" dur="4.89">still be able to attend a closed session</text>
  <text start="312.7" dur="5.22">with Muller staff following the open</text>
  <text start="315.85" dur="4.26">testimony where they&amp;#39;ll be able to ask</text>
  <text start="317.92" dur="5.97">about material that was redacted from</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="7.83">public I notice the closed session</text>
  <text start="323.89" dur="6.24">without Muller this is with Andrew</text>
  <text start="327.94" dur="4.8">Weissman and the key members of the</text>
  <text start="330.13" dur="5.19">investigative unit this is the heart of</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="7.65">the real corruption Muller is only the</text>
  <text start="335.32" dur="7.44">figurehead Wiseman is the person and the</text>
  <text start="340.39" dur="6.78">closed-door session allows the Democrats</text>
  <text start="342.76" dur="6.39">to use the Weissman testimony so this is</text>
  <text start="347.17" dur="3.18">how it works each member of the</text>
  <text start="349.15" dur="3.81">Intelligence Committee will be able to</text>
  <text start="350.35" dur="5.52">ask Muller questions for five minutes in</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="6.99">the open session before following up in</text>
  <text start="355.87" dur="7.23">a similar closed session limit the</text>
  <text start="359.95" dur="5.43">exposure of Muller is a way for Pelosi</text>
  <text start="363.1" dur="7.38">Schiff and ala to mitigate the risk only</text>
  <text start="365.38" dur="8.67">run only one round of questions it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="370.48" dur="6.63">very nice trick notice the closed-door</text>
  <text start="374.05" dur="4.77">sessions are not classified this is the</text>
  <text start="377.11" dur="4.65">way for Pelosi Schiff and Ally to get</text>
  <text start="378.82" dur="5.91">the material the innuendo and suspicion</text>
  <text start="381.76" dur="4.89">injected into their narrative the</text>
  <text start="384.73" dur="4.02">unredacted content will be discussed</text>
  <text start="386.65" dur="4.26">that means all of the investigative</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="4.38">pathways including the maliciously</text>
  <text start="390.91" dur="4.74">corrupt false trails will be put into</text>
  <text start="393.13" dur="5.73">the discussion and the politicians are</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="5.45">free to talk about any all content of</text>
  <text start="398.86" dur="6.72">that discussion because it is not</text>
  <text start="401.1" dur="6.55">classified without a transcript because</text>
  <text start="405.58" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s going to be no transcript in</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="4.8">this in the closed session there will be</text>
  <text start="410.44" dur="4.83">no factual record of the testimony</text>
  <text start="412.45" dur="5.91">behind closed doors this allows Pelosi</text>
  <text start="415.27" dur="5.13">shift Nadler and staff to make any claim</text>
  <text start="418.36" dur="5.37">about the content regardless of the</text>
  <text start="420.4" dur="7.89">level of falsity and there&amp;#39;s no factual</text>
  <text start="423.73" dur="6.93">way for rebuttal this is by design</text>
  <text start="428.29" dur="4.47">Muller was selected for this role by the</text>
  <text start="430.66" dur="4.5">internal Department of Justice and FBI</text>
  <text start="432.76" dur="4.32">group who carried out the investigation</text>
  <text start="435.16" dur="4.77">the real scheming is by the team</text>
  <text start="437.08" dur="5.46">directly under Muller and Muller gets to</text>
  <text start="439.93" dur="5.49">play the role a willfully blind to the</text>
  <text start="442.54" dur="4.32">scheme Muller didn&amp;#39;t select his team the</text>
  <text start="445.42" dur="5.01">pre-existing team of corrupt officials</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="6.45">selected him and this brings us to the</text>
  <text start="450.43" dur="4.74">law fair group now not enough people</text>
  <text start="453.31" dur="3.27">understand the role of law fair group in</text>
  <text start="455.17" dur="2.82">the corruption and political</text>
  <text start="456.58" dur="4.38">weaponization of the Department of</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="6.45">Justice FBI and larger intelligence</text>
  <text start="460.96" dur="5.61">community what media matters is to</text>
  <text start="464.44" dur="4.02">corrupt left-wing media the law fair</text>
  <text start="466.57" dur="5.49">group is to the corrupt Department of</text>
  <text start="468.46" dur="5.79">Justice and FBI remember special</text>
  <text start="472.06" dur="4.92">prosecutor Robert Muller didn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="474.25" dur="5.04">into this process as an outsider and</text>
  <text start="476.98" dur="4.82">Muller didn&amp;#39;t select his team the</text>
  <text start="479.29" dur="6.77">corrupt law Fair team inside government</text>
  <text start="481.8" dur="7.3">James Baker Andrew Weissman McCabe</text>
  <text start="486.06" dur="4.24">already knew Muller the team had</text>
  <text start="489.1" dur="3.42">established personal professional</text>
  <text start="490.3" dur="5.88">connections to Muller and they brought</text>
  <text start="492.52" dur="5.19">him in to lead the team when you realize</text>
  <text start="496.18" dur="4.14">that Muller didn&amp;#39;t select the team</text>
  <text start="497.71" dur="5.52">rather the pre-existing team selected</text>
  <text start="500.32" dur="4.44">their figurehead Robert Muller then</text>
  <text start="503.23" dur="3.63">results makes sense</text>
  <text start="504.76" dur="4.41">Robert Muller can never be allowed to</text>
  <text start="506.86" dur="4.5">testify to Congress without extremely</text>
  <text start="509.17" dur="4.62">tight controls because if questioned</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="6.69">Muller actually has a very little</text>
  <text start="513.79" dur="6.75">understanding of what took place he was</text>
  <text start="518.05" dur="6.45">just the figurehead there were all these</text>
  <text start="520.54" dur="6.51">people behind him many of the weaponized</text>
  <text start="524.5" dur="6">approaches used radical legal theory and</text>
  <text start="527.05" dur="6.21">that ties into the purpose and methods</text>
  <text start="530.5" dur="5.37">of the lawfare group the intent of law</text>
  <text start="533.26" dur="7.23">fair is described in the name to use law</text>
  <text start="535.87" dur="10.29">as a tool in warfare and this</text>
  <text start="540.49" dur="11.58">organization has now built all of this</text>
  <text start="546.16" dur="9.95">on fighting anyone that tries to stop</text>
  <text start="552.07" dur="7.47">what they&amp;#39;re doing they consider this an</text>
  <text start="556.11" dur="5.02">internal war and remember their main</text>
  <text start="559.54" dur="5.58">objective</text>
  <text start="561.13" dur="5.61">was to impeach Trump how they were going</text>
  <text start="565.12" dur="4.53">to use the Malheur report there is going</text>
  <text start="566.74" dur="6.03">to be some evidence of collusion with</text>
  <text start="569.65" dur="5.85">Russia there was going to be information</text>
  <text start="572.77" dur="5.4">in there would show that he obstructed</text>
  <text start="575.5" dur="6.03">and they were going to use all of this</text>
  <text start="578.17" dur="6.9">to impeach Trump the report didn&amp;#39;t show</text>
  <text start="581.53" dur="5.58">this so as q would always say what are</text>
  <text start="585.07" dur="4.86">they doing they&amp;#39;re keeping this going</text>
  <text start="587.11" dur="5.04">because they have nothing else and this</text>
  <text start="589.93" dur="4.08">is why they&amp;#39;re setting this up this is</text>
  <text start="592.15" dur="4.44">why they&amp;#39;re having these closed-door</text>
  <text start="594.01" dur="5.97">sessions there&amp;#39;s no transparency here</text>
  <text start="596.59" dur="6.21">this is about manipulating all of this</text>
  <text start="599.98" dur="5.7">to make it look like they have something</text>
  <text start="602.8" dur="5.76">and they&amp;#39;re going to use this as their</text>
  <text start="605.68" dur="6.39">weapon but the Patriots they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="608.56" dur="5.13">counter actually new documents were</text>
