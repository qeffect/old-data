  <text start="268.669" dur="6.871">and he&amp;#39;s worried now</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="5.88">this is what he tweeted AI is making it</text>
  <text start="275.54" dur="5.07">disturbingly easy to create convincing</text>
  <text start="277.97" dur="5.87">fake videos with implications for</text>
  <text start="280.61" dur="5.43">disinformation but also harassment</text>
  <text start="283.84" dur="5.44">stories from women who have been</text>
  <text start="286.04" dur="5.58">targeted with degrading deep fakes show</text>
  <text start="289.28" dur="6.18">just some of the ways this technology</text>
  <text start="291.62" dur="6.63">can be abused and what he did was he</text>
  <text start="295.46" dur="4.92">linked to a Washington Post article fake</text>
  <text start="298.25" dur="4.11">porn videos are being weaponized to</text>

  <text start="309.41" dur="7.47">Adam Schiff is doing here Q has already</text>
  <text start="313.46" dur="6.39">told us that certain players would take</text>
  <text start="316.88" dur="5.789">this approach because one he might have</text>
  <text start="319.85" dur="5.04">been caught up in a video and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="322.669" dur="4.461">projecting out there that it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="324.89" dur="4.83">be a fake video because of this reason</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="5.2">we know that there&amp;#39;s other videos of</text>
  <text start="329.72" dur="6.42">Clinton Obama and the rest so we need to</text>
  <text start="332.33" dur="7.71">go back to post 868 q and this is March</text>

  <text start="521.05" dur="6.69">security now I do believe that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="524.5" dur="4.92">reason why Trump is keeping the</text>
  <text start="527.74" dur="5.97">government shutdown I think this is part</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="7.74">of his plan and I do believe this is</text>
  <text start="533.71" dur="6.03">part of the the bigger agenda here now</text>
  <text start="537.16" dur="6.57">the other part of the agenda is to</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="6.14">educate the American people on what has</text>

  <text start="562.42" dur="4.56">working people are becoming educated and</text>
  <text start="565.45" dur="2.85">as more and more people become educated</text>
  <text start="566.98" dur="5.82">the more and more people are going to</text>
  <text start="568.3" dur="7.41">say yes we need better security and if</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="5.34">we look we can see that an ABC</text>
  <text start="575.71" dur="4.8">Washington Post poll and I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="578.14" dur="2.94">these numbers are exactly where they</text>
  <text start="580.51" dur="2.79">should be</text>
  <text start="581.08" dur="4.41">they probably alter them in some way to</text>
  <text start="583.3" dur="2.76">make them look a lot lower than they</text>
  <text start="585.49" dur="3.27">really are</text>

  <text start="840.95" dur="4.259">about and I want to go a little bit</text>
  <text start="842.66" dur="4.11">further into this shutdown because we</text>
  <text start="845.209" dur="4.351">know there&amp;#39;s many different agendas</text>
  <text start="846.77" dur="4.95">associated with this first of all coming</text>
  <text start="849.56" dur="3.96">out of Politico a federal judge today</text>
  <text start="851.72" dur="3.45">declined to order the Trump</text>

  <text start="863.839" dur="5.19">to usurp the Constitution finally</text>
  <text start="866.75" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re following the rule of law now</text>
  <text start="869.029" dur="4.441">Jim Jordan he also tweeted out and he</text>
  <text start="871.97" dur="2.94">said the following in case you needed</text>
  <text start="873.47" dur="3.72">more proof that Democrats are more</text>
  <text start="874.91" dur="4.77">interested in stopping the President and</text>
  <text start="877.19" dur="5.399">helping the country they rejected</text>
  <text start="879.68" dur="5.219">president Trump&amp;#39;s invitation to meet at</text>

  <text start="884.899" dur="6.301">compromise to secure the border and end</text>
  <text start="887.87" dur="5.219">the shutdown now we need to think about</text>
  <text start="891.2" dur="4.079">this for a second first of all one</text>
  <text start="893.089" dur="3.87">agenda is to educate the public they</text>
  <text start="895.279" dur="2.141">really didn&amp;#39;t know what was going on at</text>
  <text start="896.959" dur="2.471">the</text>
  <text start="897.42" dur="4.38">and we know this is part of the deep</text>
  <text start="899.43" dur="3.87">state where they&amp;#39;re bringing in children</text>
  <text start="901.8" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s human trafficking</text>
  <text start="903.3" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re bringing in drugs this is how</text>
  <text start="905.31" dur="5.37">they fund a lot of their covert</text>
  <text start="906.63" dur="6.36">operation and Trump is waking America up</text>
  <text start="910.68" dur="4.56">to this fact that all of this is</text>
  <text start="912.99" dur="6">happening at the border</text>
  <text start="915.24" dur="5.91">that&amp;#39;s one agenda second agenda is to</text>
  <text start="918.99" dur="4.53">point the finger at those who are</text>
  <text start="921.15" dur="5.28">responsible and to show that these</text>
  <text start="923.52" dur="5.1">individuals don&amp;#39;t care about Americans</text>
  <text start="926.43" dur="4.77">think about what he&amp;#39;s done since the</text>
  <text start="928.62" dur="4.74">shutdown and since people aren&amp;#39;t getting</text>
  <text start="931.2" dur="4.11">paid and the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="933.36" dur="4.32">carrying on that all these people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="935.31" dur="4.8">getting paid and you see people you know</text>
  <text start="937.68" dur="5.34">holding up signs we want to work we want</text>
  <text start="940.11" dur="4.71">to work and the Dems the deep state</text>
  <text start="943.02" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re all out there saying this is</text>
  <text start="944.82" dur="5.19">horrific well the news broke that these</text>
  <text start="947.37" dur="4.95">individuals are in Puerto Rico enjoying</text>
  <text start="950.01" dur="5.37">themselves on the beach and getting paid</text>
  <text start="952.32" dur="5.73">hmm agenda number two now what about</text>
  <text start="955.38" dur="5.7">agenda number three this is a lot larger</text>
  <text start="958.05" dur="5.67">than the other two remember Trump can</text>
  <text start="961.08" dur="4.89">build the wall at any time he just has</text>
  <text start="963.72" dur="5.16">to declare a national emergency I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="965.97" dur="5.34">think he really wants to do that I think</text>
  <text start="968.88" dur="3.98">there&amp;#39;s a reason why we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="971.31" dur="5.13">shutdown and we mentioned this yesterday</text>
  <text start="972.86" dur="5.71">about that op-ed that article from a</text>
  <text start="976.44" dur="4.95">government employee who says you know</text>
  <text start="978.57" dur="9.36">let&amp;#39;s weed out the individuals in</text>
  <text start="981.39" dur="9.18">government now it seems that Trump might</text>
  <text start="987.93" dur="6.27">have suckered the Democrats in the deep</text>
  <text start="990.57" dur="6.27">state into this shutdown remember Trump</text>
  <text start="994.2" dur="6.09">is a businessman he&amp;#39;s not a politician</text>
  <text start="996.84" dur="6.03">and in business you have to be strong</text>
  <text start="1000.29" dur="6.62">you don&amp;#39;t give in and there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="1002.87" dur="7.89">why you&amp;#39;re doing something which is not</text>
  <text start="1006.91" dur="6.22">noticeable by everyone usually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1010.76" dur="6.54">behind the scenes and nobody realizes it</text>
  <text start="1013.13" dur="9.06">until it happens this is the longest</text>
  <text start="1017.3" dur="8.64">shutdown we have seen it&amp;#39;s 25 days you</text>
  <text start="1022.19" dur="6.72">know what happens in five more days well</text>
  <text start="1025.94" dur="4.23">that will bring us to 30 days now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1028.91" dur="1.87">very interesting about this numbers</text>
  <text start="1030.17" dur="3.76">third</text>
  <text start="1030.78" dur="6.929">and I need to go back to Q&amp;#39;s posts</text>
  <text start="1033.93" dur="6.029">because this talks about the number 30</text>
  <text start="1037.709" dur="9.87">and you&amp;#39;re gonna have to follow me on</text>
  <text start="1039.959" dur="10.861">this one if we go back to post 1280 1933</text>
  <text start="1047.579" dur="6.841">and 1935 now I know this has Flynn in</text>
  <text start="1050.82" dur="7.47">there in post 1280 this is April 27 2018</text>
  <text start="1054.42" dur="7.56">it says done in 30 with brackets 30 and</text>
  <text start="1058.29" dur="6.27">then under it it talks about Flynn post</text>
  <text start="1061.98" dur="4.56">1933 this is August 26 2018</text>
  <text start="1064.56" dur="4.71">it says suicide weakened hands up and</text>
  <text start="1066.54" dur="8.73">again brackets in 30</text>
  <text start="1069.27" dur="11.04">if we move to post 1935 August 27 2018</text>
  <text start="1075.27" dur="10.5">it says think Flynn brackets 30 exactly</text>
  <text start="1080.31" dur="8.88">30 again now in five days we reach 30</text>
  <text start="1085.77" dur="8.99">days what does that mean and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1089.19" dur="10.68">exactly 30 days well what Trump can do</text>
  <text start="1094.76" dur="10.69">after we hit the 30 day mark he can</text>
  <text start="1099.87" dur="12.15">enable permanent layoffs what does that</text>
  <text start="1105.45" dur="9.3">mean well layoff is called IRF this is a</text>
  <text start="1112.02" dur="5.22">reduction in force and of course it</text>
  <text start="1114.75" dur="4.65">comes with a slew of civil service</text>
  <text start="1117.24" dur="5.4">protections but if the guidelines are</text>
  <text start="1119.4" dur="8.7">followed bureaucrats can be laid off as</text>
  <text start="1122.64" dur="7.59">in no more job a reduction in force is</text>
  <text start="1128.1" dur="4.77">thoughtful and systematic elimination of</text>
  <text start="1130.23" dur="5.16">positions for all practical purposes a</text>
  <text start="1132.87" dur="5.67">government IRF is the same thing as a</text>
  <text start="1135.39" dur="5.37">layoff organizations must stick to</text>
  <text start="1138.54" dur="4.68">predetermined criteria when sorting out</text>
  <text start="1140.76" dur="5.94">what happens to each employee they must</text>
  <text start="1143.22" dur="6.03">communicate with employees how and why</text>
  <text start="1146.7" dur="3.3">decisions are made in deciding who stays</text>
  <text start="1149.25" dur="3.15">and who goes</text>
  <text start="1150" dur="6.24">federal agencies must take four factors</text>
  <text start="1152.4" dur="5.34">into account tenure veteran status total</text>
  <text start="1156.24" dur="5.16">federal civil civilian and military</text>
  <text start="1157.74" dur="7.2">service performance agencies cannot use</text>
  <text start="1161.4" dur="9.09">IRF procedures to fire bad</text>
  <text start="1164.94" dur="8.32">so if we look at this and we think about</text>
  <text start="1170.49" dur="4.45">draining the swamp and the swamp is just</text>
  <text start="1173.26" dur="3.24">not those people that are being arrested</text>
  <text start="1174.94" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s not the central bank</text>
  <text start="1176.5" dur="5.789">it&amp;#39;s what the deep state has been doing</text>
  <text start="1179.08" dur="6.02">to government for a very long time we</text>
  <text start="1182.289" dur="7.11">know a lot of people in government well</text>
  <text start="1185.1" dur="9.15">they are the swamp they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="1189.399" dur="10.64">against the Patriots how do you mass</text>
  <text start="1194.25" dur="9.659">drain the swamp well you have a shutdown</text>
  <text start="1200.039" dur="11.321">you wait for exactly 30 days and you</text>
  <text start="1203.909" dur="9.4">implement a reduction in force now are</text>
  <text start="1211.36" dur="4.919">we going to hit in the 30 days then I</text>
  <text start="1213.309" dur="5.911">don&amp;#39;t know but we are very very close</text>
  <text start="1216.279" dur="5.431">and I know Trump is out there and this</text>
  <text start="1219.22" dur="5.429">is all part of the plan where he says</text>
  <text start="1221.71" dur="5.219">listen let&amp;#39;s make a deal I like to</text>
  <text start="1224.649" dur="7.081">negotiate let&amp;#39;s talk about the border</text>
  <text start="1226.929" dur="6.96">and if you notice the Democrats they</text>
  <text start="1231.73" dur="4.98">might be thinking that this is really</text>
  <text start="1233.889" dur="6.121">about the wall that this is really about</text>
  <text start="1236.71" dur="6.38">the billions of dollars do you really</text>
  <text start="1240.01" dur="5.519">think Trump needs the five billion no</text>
  <text start="1243.09" dur="5.079">all he needs is the national emergency</text>
  <text start="1245.529" dur="6.03">here&amp;#39;s all the funds he wants you really</text>
  <text start="1248.169" dur="7.161">think he needs the Democrats to vote on</text>
  <text start="1251.559" dur="7.5">this to give him permission No</text>
  <text start="1255.33" dur="7.42">so why is he holding out well we went</text>
  <text start="1259.059" dur="5.161">over that one educate the public make</text>
  <text start="1262.75" dur="4.649">sure that all fingers are pointing at</text>
  <text start="1264.22" dur="10.169">the Democrats but the larger part of</text>
  <text start="1267.399" dur="12.421">this is to maybe drain the swamp big</text>
  <text start="1274.389" dur="8.91">time and when you look at Qs post it</text>
  <text start="1279.82" dur="6.78">keeps saying exactly 30 now who are</text>
  <text start="1283.299" dur="7.281">these people that are going to be laid</text>
  <text start="1286.6" dur="7.28">off and if they are laid off</text>
  <text start="1290.58" dur="5.94">who does that effect</text>
  <text start="1293.88" dur="7.029">well we won&amp;#39;t know until it happens</text>
  <text start="1296.52" dur="7.21">unless we get some type of indication so</text>
  <text start="1300.909" dur="8.211">this might be a lot bigger than we all</text>
  <text start="1303.73" dur="7.47">think and it&amp;#39;s only five days away</text>
