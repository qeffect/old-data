  <text start="118.89" dur="5.31">we see it is plunging once again it is</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="4.68">down the high frequency team the plunge</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="4.71">Protection Team they just couldn&amp;#39;t bring</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="4.77">it into the positive range looks like</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="4.2">the investors are looking at the</text>
  <text start="131.22" dur="4.17">situation and saying you know what maybe</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s time to cash out right now I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="135.39" dur="4.29">little hesitant and keeping my money in</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="3.42">the market let&amp;#39;s start pulling it out</text>
  <text start="139.68" dur="3">and of course we had that little boy</text>
  <text start="141.06" dur="3.89">but when the Fed came out they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="142.68" dur="4.68">okay maybe we&amp;#39;re going to extend</text>
  <text start="144.95" dur="4.99">quantitative easing maybe we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="147.36" dur="3.989">even add QE four and of course they did</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="3.9">this because the market was continually</text>
  <text start="151.349" dur="4.11">dropping and now we see it is dropping</text>
  <text start="153.84" dur="4.79">once again so they might have to mention</text>
  <text start="155.459" dur="6.931">this once again or they might have to</text>
  <text start="158.63" dur="6.25">kind of not paper at this time because</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="5.4">as we can see the free money is the only</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="5.13">thing keeping this entire system going</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="5.07">like I said yesterday it&amp;#39;s about two</text>
  <text start="170.01" dur="6.66">hundred billion dollars a quarter to</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="6.39">keep this whole system up from crashing</text>
  <text start="176.67" dur="5.819">and tumbling down but we look at the</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="6">consumer price index right now and last</text>
  <text start="182.489" dur="5.97">month shocking 0.2 percent drop in CPI</text>
  <text start="185.25" dur="5.849">was driven mostly by the plunging</text>
  <text start="188.459" dur="3.151">gasoline prices but September it looks</text>
  <text start="191.099" dur="4.051">like</text>
  <text start="191.61" dur="6.84">consumer prices have gone back up about</text>
  <text start="195.15" dur="5.309">1.7 percent from a year ago or 0.1</text>

  <text start="215.13" dur="5.609">increased 0.5 percent its tenth increase</text>
  <text start="217.92" dur="5.58">in the last 11 months and when we look</text>
  <text start="220.739" dur="4.411">at the food index it rose about 0.3</text>
  <text start="223.5" dur="4.769">percent in September after increasing</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="5.989">0.2 percent in August the index for</text>

  <text start="252.15" dur="4.559">when you go to the markets you can see</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="4.349">that food is continually going up of</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="4.68">course the energy prices the gas prices</text>
  <text start="259.079" dur="4.951">are coming down right now because what</text>
  <text start="261.389" dur="3.78">the US government Saudi Arabia what</text>
  <text start="264.03" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="265.169" dur="5.851">to plunge the oil prices trying to make</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="5.549">it look like the sanctions are working</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="4.05">against Russia they&amp;#39;re trying to destroy</text>
  <text start="274.229" dur="3.001">the Akana</text>
  <text start="275.07" dur="4.14">me of Russia and I really don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="277.23" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s having the effect they really want</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="4.74">and we might see gas prices go right</text>
  <text start="281.76" dur="4.56">back up as soon as they start to realize</text>
  <text start="283.95" dur="6.45">that maybe we&amp;#39;re hurting the US economy</text>
  <text start="286.32" dur="7.08">more so than the Russian economy now it</text>
  <text start="290.4" dur="4.95">looks like real hourly wages have</text>
  <text start="293.4" dur="4.65">dropped in September</text>
  <text start="295.35" dur="5.31">BLS announced that real average hourly</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="4.56">earnings declined once again this time</text>
  <text start="300.66" dur="4.14">from ten dollars and 34 cents to ten</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="4.14">dollars and 32 cents which is a negative</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="6.23">0.2 percent drop from the past month</text>
  <text start="306.75" dur="8.31">there now has been about five outright</text>
  <text start="311.03" dur="6.64">decreases in real our our wages since</text>
  <text start="315.06" dur="5.31">March of this year putting America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.67" dur="6.48">real wages in context of 10,000 34 cents</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="7.26">real hourly wage is at a level last seen</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="6.08">in December of 2008 just after the</text>
  <text start="327.63" dur="6.21">Lehman collapse so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="330.23" dur="7.24">wages are coming down not going up and</text>
  <text start="333.84" dur="5.58">prices of food and energy are increasing</text>
  <text start="337.47" dur="4.92">even though energy has come down they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.42" dur="5.55">still at all-time highs right now I mean</text>
  <text start="342.39" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re paying over $3 a gallon for gas</text>
  <text start="344.97" dur="4.74">yes in other places you might see two</text>
  <text start="347.64" dur="3.93">dollars and 80 cents or two dollars and</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="4.71">ninety cents and in some places you</text>
  <text start="351.57" dur="5.25">might see closer to four dollars but we</text>
  <text start="354.42" dur="4.29">can see gas prices are very very high</text>
  <text start="356.82" dur="4.35">and when you go to the market you know</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="5.13">food is continually increasing and this</text>
  <text start="361.17" dur="4.77">is why McDonald&amp;#39;s they are having a huge</text>
  <text start="363.84" dur="4.41">amount of trouble because their dollar</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="4.89">menu is no longer a dollar and if your</text>
  <text start="368.25" dur="4.14">real wages aren&amp;#39;t going up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="4.23">decreasing and the prices of everything</text>
  <text start="372.39" dur="5.82">else is going up guess what you just</text>
  <text start="375.06" dur="5.19">can&amp;#39;t afford it now we talked a lot</text>
  <text start="378.21" dur="5.19">about retail and we understand that the</text>
  <text start="380.25" dur="4.74">retail market is really getting hit hard</text>
  <text start="383.4" dur="4.02">why because a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="384.99" dur="4.14">unemployed underemployed and they just</text>
  <text start="387.42" dur="3.24">don&amp;#39;t have those discretionary funds to</text>
  <text start="389.13" dur="3.18">say you know what let&amp;#39;s go after the</text>
  <text start="390.66" dur="3.33">store and buy something nice instead</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;re worrying about how they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="393.99" dur="3.12">to feed their family how are they going</text>
  <text start="395.16" dur="3.63">to pay rent and how they&amp;#39;re going to put</text>
  <text start="397.11" dur="3.72">clothes on their kids and this is what</text>
  <text start="398.79" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re worried about right now but what</text>
  <text start="400.83" dur="5.94">we&amp;#39;re seeing is the chain store sales</text>
  <text start="402.93" dur="5.69">growth plunged 2.1 percent year-on-year</text>
  <text start="406.77" dur="4.28">this is the week</text>
  <text start="408.62" dur="7.109">in five months and worse for this time</text>
  <text start="411.05" dur="7.64">of year since 2010 this is not going</text>
  <text start="415.729" dur="6.151">well and yesterday we reported that</text>
  <text start="418.69" dur="7.229">existing home sales they saw a bump up</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="8.4">but if you look back one-year housing is</text>
  <text start="425.919" dur="6.611">1.7 percent lower than last September</text>
  <text start="430.28" dur="4.859">think about this for a second how could</text>
  <text start="432.53" dur="5.669">this possibly be we have unemployment</text>
  <text start="435.139" dur="4.711">coming down to 5.9 percent I mean more</text>
  <text start="438.199" dur="4.051">people are employed that means more</text>
  <text start="439.85" dur="4.08">people are saving you would think that</text>
  <text start="442.25" dur="3.21">more people would say okay now it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="443.93" dur="3.9">for me to go out and purchase a house</text>
  <text start="445.46" dur="5.67">but we are not seeing this we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="8.459">seeing this in retail why because these</text>
  <text start="451.13" dur="8.009">jobs are not full-time high paying jobs</text>
  <text start="456.289" dur="6.211">this cannot be sustained and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.139" dur="5.611">evident in the real estate market and in</text>
  <text start="462.5" dur="4.949">the retail market and the mortgages we</text>
  <text start="464.75" dur="6.12">see there can continually moving</text>
  <text start="467.449" dur="5.311">downward not up so people who are</text>
  <text start="470.87" dur="5.7">applying for mortgages they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.76" dur="5.51">non-existing at this time and what else</text>
  <text start="476.57" dur="4.68">are we seeing with housing well we see</text>
  <text start="478.27" dur="6.579">inventory for sale is six percent higher</text>
  <text start="481.25" dur="6.06">than last September lower sales and</text>
  <text start="484.849" dur="4.921">higher inventory always do wonders for</text>
  <text start="487.31" dur="5.25">prices and what does that mean prices</text>
  <text start="489.77" dur="5.22">are coming down this means people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="5.789">move their homes so more and more being</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="5.64">added to the market they&amp;#39;re staying on</text>
  <text start="498.349" dur="4.111">the market longer prices are now</text>
  <text start="500.63" dur="3.659">starting to come down people are getting</text>
  <text start="502.46" dur="3.51">nervous they don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="504.289" dur="3.931">and we also have to remember the</text>
  <text start="505.97" dur="7.949">first-time homebuyers should be around</text>
  <text start="508.22" dur="10.71">40% it is around 29% this is not a good</text>
  <text start="513.919" dur="7.411">sign and mortgage applications remain at</text>
  <text start="518.93" dur="6.48">two decade low despite mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="521.33" dur="9.21">below 4% think about this mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="7.14">below 4% and the banks the mortgage</text>
  <text start="530.54" dur="4.89">departments have been laying off people</text>
  <text start="532.55" dur="6.3">left and right by the thousands go back</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="6.57">to 2013 go onto Google you will see</text>

  <text start="542.66" dur="4.65">of tens of thousands of people starting</text>
  <text start="545.3" dur="4.709">back in August of 2013 because they knew</text>
  <text start="547.31" dur="4.44">the American people we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="550.009" dur="4.591">be able to take out these loans and it</text>
  <text start="551.75" dur="8.37">is completely evident today one year</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="7.95">later now the gauge of loan requests for</text>
  <text start="560.12" dur="7.56">home purchases a leading indicator of</text>
  <text start="562.55" dur="8.279">home sales fell again by 4.8% this means</text>
  <text start="567.68" dur="5.49">we are heading into some bad times come</text>
  <text start="570.829" dur="4.591">this winter and of course the central</text>
  <text start="573.17" dur="4.68">bankers the US government they are doing</text>
  <text start="575.42" dur="4.95">everything they possibly can to push</text>
  <text start="577.85" dur="4.289">this market up and we see Fannie Mae</text>
  <text start="580.37" dur="4.5">Freddie Mac out there saying listen you</text>
  <text start="582.139" dur="4.14">only need three percent down to purchase</text>
  <text start="584.87" dur="3.269">a home and guess what we&amp;#39;ll just take</text>
  <text start="586.279" dur="2.581">any subprime person right now if you</text>
  <text start="588.139" dur="3.69">have a heartbeat</text>
  <text start="588.86" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;ll give you some uh we&amp;#39;ll give you a</text>
  <text start="591.829" dur="5.07">home loan will even insure it and</text>
  <text start="594.35" dur="4.32">guarantee it just pick up a house please</text>
  <text start="596.899" dur="4.17">and they&amp;#39;re doing everything they</text>
  <text start="598.67" dur="4.62">possibly can we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing</text>
  <text start="601.069" dur="3.45">in the auto industry and that&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="603.29" dur="3.75">to backfire because we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="604.519" dur="5.641">delinquencies rising they&amp;#39;re up about 70</text>
  <text start="607.04" dur="5.039">percent and this whole thing cannot be</text>
  <text start="610.16" dur="4.169">sustained and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="612.079" dur="5.161">happen the entire system is going to</text>
  <text start="614.329" dur="5.76">come crumbling down now as we see the</text>

  <text start="1472.02" dur="4.6">careful about these vaccines because it</text>
  <text start="1474.51" dur="3.549">reminds me of the 2009</text>

  <text start="1892.539" dur="4.321">create a buffer zone in Syria for the</text>
  <text start="1894.309" dur="5.911">rebels using Turkish troops and American</text>
  <text start="1896.86" dur="6.48">airpower why because the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1900.22" dur="5.459">has an Air Force but don&amp;#39;t worry because</text>
  <text start="1903.34" dur="4.35">Syria claims that they have destroyed</text>
  <text start="1905.679" dur="4.171">two of the Jets that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1907.69" dur="4.109">has and they&amp;#39;re going after the other</text>
  <text start="1909.85" dur="3.78">one right now and once they find it they</text>
  <text start="1911.799" dur="4.021">will destroy that one so they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1913.63" dur="5.01">to put the Air Force of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1915.82" dur="6.089">state to rest here and again we go back</text>
  <text start="1918.64" dur="5.31">to why do we need a no-fly zone if the</text>
  <text start="1921.909" dur="4.921">Islamic state doesn&amp;#39;t have an Air Force</text>
  <text start="1923.95" dur="5.04">it really doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="1926.83" dur="3.719">whatsoever but of course they want the</text>
  <text start="1928.99" dur="2.61">no-fly zone because eventually what</text>
  <text start="1930.549" dur="3.781">they&amp;#39;re going to do is going to create</text>
  <text start="1931.6" dur="4.74">that zone between Turkey and Syria and</text>
  <text start="1934.33" dur="4.079">they can have the Turkish troops come in</text>
  <text start="1936.34" dur="4.68">once they&amp;#39;re attacked NATO will join in</text>
  <text start="1938.409" dur="4.921">and they&amp;#39;re going to pretty much destroy</text>
  <text start="1941.02" dur="5.61">the Syrian Air Force because this is</text>
  <text start="1943.33" dur="6.03">what they need to maneuver all the Free</text>
  <text start="1946.63" dur="6">Syrian Army soldiers the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1949.36" dur="6.24">soldiers the Turkish soldiers all into</text>
  <text start="1952.63" dur="6.179">Syria to go after Assad and this is</text>
  <text start="1955.6" dur="6.18">their plan now it looks like staples was</text>
  <text start="1958.809" dur="5.041">hit by a cyberattack we don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="1961.78" dur="4.259">extent of it and what was really stolen</text>
  <text start="1963.85" dur="5.85">at this time and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="1966.039" dur="5.701">retailers being hit by cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="1969.7" dur="5.24">recently you have to remember most of</text>
  <text start="1971.74" dur="6.569">these systems have backdoors which was</text>
  <text start="1974.94" dur="5.41">created by the NSA who made deals with a</text>
  <text start="1978.309" dur="4.411">lot of the computer manufacturers or</text>
  <text start="1980.35" dur="5.1">made deals with the companies and you</text>
  <text start="1982.72" dur="5.52">have to remember criminals can find</text>
  <text start="1985.45" dur="6.03">these backdoors and use them but what I</text>
  <text start="1988.24" dur="6.09">see happening here is that in this short</text>
  <text start="1991.48" dur="5.34">period of time going back to November 2</text>
  <text start="1994.33" dur="5.099">right now it seems like we&amp;#39;ve had a lot</text>
  <text start="1996.82" dur="5.9">of data breaches and of course as we</text>
  <text start="1999.429" dur="6.181">know they always create something and</text>
  <text start="2002.72" dur="6.37">some type of an event some type of an</text>
  <text start="2005.61" dur="4.98">urgent need while they have the solution</text>
  <text start="2009.09" dur="4.74">on the back end and the sole</text>
  <text start="2010.59" dur="5.43">chin is sisse or sista which is pending</text>
  <text start="2013.83" dur="4.41">in the Senate they want to vote on that</text>
  <text start="2016.02" dur="4.08">and have it passed the president has</text>
  <text start="2018.24" dur="3.78">already created all the executive orders</text>
  <text start="2020.1" dur="4.29">that will support this and what this</text>
  <text start="2022.02" dur="3.779">does is allows companies to share your</text>
  <text start="2024.39" dur="4.62">private information with the government</text>
  <text start="2025.799" dur="5.281">and they cannot be held responsible and</text>
  <text start="2029.01" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s a lot of other things in these</text>
  <text start="2031.08" dur="3.329">documents which will allow the</text>
  <text start="2032.94" dur="3.81">government to pretty much take control</text>
  <text start="2034.409" dur="6">of the internet and we can see they are</text>
  <text start="2036.75" dur="6.57">pushing this agenda very very hard and</text>
  <text start="2040.409" dur="5.25">each time we see this they put out coals</text>
  <text start="2043.32" dur="3.989">to say okay do you think we have the</text>
  <text start="2045.659" dur="3.901">votes to push this through and of course</text>
  <text start="2047.309" dur="4.8">Obama&amp;#39;s out there saying know if these</text>
  <text start="2049.56" dur="4.98">sista or cysts so across my desk I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2052.109" dur="4.441">going to veto it but then again whatever</text>
  <text start="2054.54" dur="4.92">he said is whatever he says is the</text>
  <text start="2056.55" dur="6.119">opposite why did he create the executive</text>
  <text start="2059.46" dur="5.219">orders that supports these bills it</text>
  <text start="2062.669" dur="4.74">makes no sense of why he would veto it</text>
  <text start="2064.679" dur="4.98">then listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="2067.409" dur="5.51">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
  <text start="2069.659" dur="3.26">be prepared thanks a lot</text>
