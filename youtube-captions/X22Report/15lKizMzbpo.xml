  <text start="44.649" dur="5.131">loans to help them out and we understand</text>
  <text start="47.71" dur="3.98">that people are very unhappy out and</text>
  <text start="49.78" dur="3.9">greased or riding the protesting and</text>
  <text start="51.69" dur="3.13">they&amp;#39;re looking at the situation and</text>
  <text start="53.68" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re saying listen we voted this</text>
  <text start="54.82" dur="4.8">government in because we wanted no</text>
  <text start="57.28" dur="4.98">austerity we wanted to end the debt</text>
  <text start="59.62" dur="4.469">bailout and we want economic growth here</text>
  <text start="62.26" dur="4.68">we want jobs we want to make a living we</text>
  <text start="64.089" dur="5.251">want to live and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="66.94" dur="3.63">they might have taken this four-month</text>
  <text start="69.34" dur="4.8">period i&amp;#39;m talking about the new</text>
  <text start="70.57" dur="6.06">government to detach themselves from the</text>
  <text start="74.14" dur="4.38">eurozone and we see they printed up</text>
  <text start="76.63" dur="4.47">drachmas they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="78.52" dur="6.45">produce them they&amp;#39;re backing everything</text>
  <text start="81.1" dur="5.85">up with gold and they might get maybe a</text>
  <text start="84.97" dur="5.34">bridge loan or so from the bricks from</text>
  <text start="86.95" dur="5.82">russia and we can see right now sybaris</text>
  <text start="90.31" dur="4.32">is out there saying that greece won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="92.77" dur="5.7">seeking a third international bailout</text>
  <text start="94.63" dur="6.269">after the four-month extension he said</text>
  <text start="98.47" dur="4.35">that some have bet on a third bailout on</text>
  <text start="100.899" dur="5.071">the possibility of a third bailout in</text>
  <text start="102.82" dur="6.589">june he said i&amp;#39;m very sorry but once</text>
  <text start="105.97" dur="6.6">again we will disappoint them once again</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="5.74">the prime minister declared the Greek</text>
  <text start="112.57" dur="5.04">people put an end to bail outs with</text>
  <text start="115.149" dur="4.351">their vote the bailouts were not only</text>
  <text start="117.61" dur="5.009">socially destructive but also</text>
  <text start="119.5" dur="5.93">economically inefficient and that is</text>
  <text start="122.619" dur="6.21">completely something I can get behind</text>
  <text start="125.43" dur="5.23">because bailouts do not help whatsoever</text>
  <text start="128.829" dur="3.63">because what happens when they</text>
  <text start="130.66" dur="3.12">continually give bailouts the two</text>
  <text start="132.459" dur="4.321">countries that push them further and</text>
  <text start="133.78" dur="6.45">further into debt people lose jobs the</text>
  <text start="136.78" dur="6.06">economy suffers and Greece is the model</text>
  <text start="140.23" dur="4.47">of that and we could</text>
  <text start="142.84" dur="3.179">see it is happening throughout the</text>
  <text start="144.7" dur="3.149">eurozone and here in the United States</text>
  <text start="146.019" dur="4.651">here in the United States they&amp;#39;re able</text>
  <text start="147.849" dur="5.041">to cover it up because they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="5.069">money so they can continually create</text>
  <text start="152.89" dur="7.349">money in Greece they have to borrow it</text>
  <text start="155.739" dur="6.091">from the eurozone the IMF to get by each</text>
  <text start="160.239" dur="3.921">and every single time they run out of</text>
  <text start="161.83" dur="4.29">money and of course there are certain</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="4.45">restrictions on them getting the money</text>
  <text start="166.12" dur="3.54">where they have to impose austerity on</text>
  <text start="168.61" dur="3.39">the people here in the United States</text>
  <text start="169.66" dur="4.109">they just keep creating the debt keeps</text>
  <text start="172" dur="5.13">getting bigger and bigger but what</text>
  <text start="173.769" dur="6.661">happens is the revenue cannot keep up</text>
  <text start="177.13" dur="6.329">with the interest payments on this debt</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="4.47">it cannot be sustained and this is why</text>
  <text start="183.459" dur="4.711">they&amp;#39;re keeping all interest rates</text>
  <text start="184.9" dur="5.369">suppressed it&amp;#39;s not because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="188.17" dur="3.599">trying to help every single person in</text>
  <text start="190.269" dur="3.421">each one of these countries they</text>
  <text start="191.769" dur="4.621">understand what is happening and they</text>
  <text start="193.69" dur="5.129">realize that they need to push their</text>
  <text start="196.39" dur="5.189">agenda forward and start a war before</text>
  <text start="198.819" dur="5.521">this entire collapse happens now we see</text>
  <text start="201.579" dur="5.461">the Senate they passed a stopgap</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="5.19">spending bill it&amp;#39;s one week and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="6.38">going to continually here warnings come</text>
  <text start="209.53" dur="6.45">out of DHS TSA letting us know the</text>
  <text start="213.42" dur="5.23">terrorists are here because they only</text>
  <text start="215.98" dur="5.039">got one week I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="218.65" dur="4.83">within this one week if we saw some type</text>
  <text start="221.019" dur="6.3">of false flag to convince Congress that</text>
  <text start="223.48" dur="6.589">yes fully fund us because like I said if</text>
  <text start="227.319" dur="5.73">they were fully funded this entire</text>
  <text start="230.069" dur="5.741">threat would just kind of disappear from</text>
  <text start="233.049" dur="4.381">the news the corporate media but since</text>
  <text start="235.81" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re only funded for one week I</text>
  <text start="237.43" dur="4.58">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they tried to</text>
  <text start="239.41" dur="5.939">push it a little bit further to and</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="6.52">staged a false flag to convince Congress</text>
  <text start="245.349" dur="5.281">that yes there are terrorists we warned</text>
  <text start="248.53" dur="4.319">you about it and they struck them all we</text>
  <text start="250.63" dur="7.289">have to remember they&amp;#39;ve been training</text>
  <text start="252.849" dur="8.13">for a mall attack and again if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="257.919" dur="5.101">going to continually tell us that</text>
  <text start="260.979" dur="4.141">there&amp;#39;s terrorism out there and we need</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="3.75">to be worried Americans should have the</text>
  <text start="265.12" dur="4.859">right to protect themselves with</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="5.78">bulletproof vests with weapons why would</text>
  <text start="269.979" dur="6.451">you make a mall a gun-free zone if</text>
  <text start="272.55" dur="6.31">they&amp;#39;re terrorists are coming and</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re going to take people hostage and</text>
  <text start="278.86" dur="5.1">kill people with weapons it makes no</text>
  <text start="281.59" dur="4.68">sense but again we know this is an</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="5.52">inside job we understand what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="5.51">trying to do here and again I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.48" dur="5.73">be surprised if we did see something</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="5.38">unless the week goes by and they see it</text>
  <text start="295.21" dur="4.14">and they hear from Congress that yes</text>
  <text start="297.16" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s going the way they want and they</text>
  <text start="299.35" dur="4.29">will get funded and then we&amp;#39;ll just see</text>
  <text start="300.82" dur="5.1">it completely died down now we talked</text>
  <text start="303.64" dur="4.35">about encryption privacy quite a bit and</text>
  <text start="305.92" dur="3.39">of course people are out there say well</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;m doing nothing wrong and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="6.39">reason to have my privacy that I have</text>
  <text start="312.58" dur="4.92">nothing to hide well I say once again if</text>
  <text start="315.7" dur="3.9">you have nothing to hide and you meet</text>
  <text start="317.5" dur="3.18">someone give them your bank account</text>
  <text start="319.6" dur="3.12">number because you have nothing to hide</text>
  <text start="320.68" dur="4.11">you could trust actually tell your</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="5.13">friend give me your bank account number</text>
  <text start="324.79" dur="6.33">tell them everything about your life all</text>
  <text start="327.85" dur="5.1">your secrets how you have sex in the</text>
  <text start="331.12" dur="3.42">bedroom because again you have nothing</text>
  <text start="332.95" dur="4.26">to hide because you&amp;#39;re allowing the</text>
  <text start="334.54" dur="4.86">government to do this you&amp;#39;re taking away</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="3.87">the choice of your privacy and handing</text>
  <text start="339.4" dur="3.45">it over to the government saying yeah I</text>
  <text start="341.08" dur="3.48">have nothing to hide so you can look at</text>
  <text start="342.85" dur="3.75">everything well if you feel that way</text>
  <text start="344.56" dur="5.79">then guess what then you have no problem</text>
  <text start="346.6" dur="5.93">telling every single person about your</text>
  <text start="350.35" dur="4.71">bank accounts about what you do and</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="6.19">everything else that you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="355.06" dur="5.43">other people to know so in reality you</text>
  <text start="358.72" dur="5.12">do want privacy because you wouldn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="6.42">out and tell someone every single thing</text>
  <text start="363.84" dur="6.19">so that argument that people make is</text>
  <text start="366.91" dur="4.8">kind of ridiculous but we understand the</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="6.18">government doesn&amp;#39;t want people to have</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="6.89">encryption and we have proof of this Kim</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="5.58">dot-com started a site called mega and</text>
  <text start="378.6" dur="5.47">right now paypal will no longer process</text>
  <text start="381.79" dur="5.34">customer payments for the cloud stored</text>
  <text start="384.07" dur="7.86">storage service mega and they were</text>
  <text start="387.13" dur="8.85">pressured by the government by US post</text>
  <text start="391.93" dur="8.94">you a motion picture association to drop</text>
  <text start="395.98" dur="7.41">mega from paypal mega said it adequately</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="4.77">pervert proved to paypal that it was</text>
  <text start="403.39" dur="4.26">legal legitimate service urging paypal</text>
  <text start="405.64" dur="4.59">to share the evidence with Visa and</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="4.53">MasterCard eventually paypal made a</text>
  <text start="410.23" dur="4.98">negotiable decision to immediately</text>
  <text start="412.18" dur="5.49">terminate services to mega PayPal has</text>
  <text start="415.21" dur="4.14">apologised for this situation and</text>
  <text start="417.67" dur="3.77">confirmed that mega management are</text>
  <text start="419.35" dur="4.74">upstanding and acting in good faith</text>
  <text start="421.44" dur="5.11">paypal acknowledged that the business is</text>
  <text start="424.09" dur="5.67">legitimate but advised that a key</text>
  <text start="426.55" dur="5.91">concern was the encryption and you have</text>
  <text start="429.76" dur="4.26">to remember the government only wants</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="3.87">you to use the encryption that they know</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="4.02">the method where they can figure out the</text>
  <text start="436.33" dur="5.04">key and break in and see what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="438.04" dur="6.3">doing Kim calm created an encryption</text>
  <text start="441.37" dur="5.22">system where the government doesn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="444.34" dur="4.32">the method and because they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="446.59" dur="4.59">the method they can&amp;#39;t figure out the key</text>
  <text start="448.66" dur="5.88">and it makes it very hard to see what</text>
  <text start="451.18" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re dealing with again people say</text>
  <text start="454.54" dur="4.98">well what&amp;#39;s the big deal why do you put</text>
  <text start="457.21" dur="5.1">things in a safe in your house why do</text>
  <text start="459.52" dur="4.97">you lock your house because you want it</text>
  <text start="462.31" dur="6.33">protected from the government and</text>
  <text start="464.49" dur="7.62">criminals same thing with encryption</text>
  <text start="468.64" dur="7.41">just because the information is</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="6.67">electronic it&amp;#39;s still your information</text>
  <text start="476.05" dur="6.15">that you want to keep private there is</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="5.22">no reason for the government to come in</text>
  <text start="482.2" dur="3.39">and take a look at it because if this</text>
  <text start="484" dur="3">was the case then just let the</text>
  <text start="485.59" dur="3.84">government come into your house every</text>
  <text start="487" dur="4.95">week let them take a look around let</text>
  <text start="489.43" dur="5.01">them open your safe if you don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="491.95" dur="4.26">problem with this because that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="494.44" dur="5.55">you&amp;#39;re allowing the do allowing them to</text>
  <text start="496.21" dur="9.03">do with electronic data and you can see</text>
  <text start="499.99" dur="8.04">the government is pushing anyone that</text>
  <text start="505.24" dur="5.88">doesn&amp;#39;t want to abide by their rules if</text>
  <text start="508.03" dur="5.67">you try to use encryption they will</text>
  <text start="511.12" dur="6.12">force a way where you can&amp;#39;t do business</text>
  <text start="513.7" dur="7.02">and we could see with mega that is the</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="5.85">proof now out in Ukraine we see</text>
  <text start="520.72" dur="5.37">Ukrainian forces only withdrew about</text>
  <text start="523.09" dur="6.63">fifteen percent of heavy heavy weaponry</text>
  <text start="526.09" dur="5.97">the eastern ukrainians the southeastern</text>
  <text start="529.72" dur="5.69">people have withdrew about eighty</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="7.68">percent of their hardware in Lugansk and</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="6.85">actually in Kiev we have noticed that</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="4.41">they are removing their heavy arms</text>
  <text start="542.26" dur="5.79">without the over</text>
  <text start="544.15" dur="7.13">of the OSCE and this raises some red</text>
  <text start="548.05" dur="7.98">flags and wondering what Kiev is</text>
  <text start="551.28" dur="6.4">actually doing because as we know they</text>
  <text start="556.03" dur="6.6">are definitely getting ready for a major</text>
  <text start="557.68" dur="7.38">offensive they tried this last time it</text>
  <text start="562.63" dur="8.48">didn&amp;#39;t go well whatsoever Putin stepped</text>
  <text start="565.06" dur="9.65">in and again put forth a peace plan even</text>
  <text start="571.11" dur="6.76">angle a Merkel and how long from France</text>
  <text start="574.71" dur="4.42">stepped in and said listen we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="577.87" dur="3.9">going on here if this goes any further</text>
  <text start="579.13" dur="4.26">we will have World War three right on</text>
  <text start="581.77" dur="4.32">our front lawns and we can&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="583.39" dur="4.68">once again and we know that the United</text>
  <text start="586.09" dur="3.9">States provides Kiev with satellite</text>
  <text start="588.07" dur="5.4">intelligence we know that they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="589.99" dur="5.7">them satellite imagery and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="593.47" dur="4.59">story out there saying that yes us does</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="4.41">supply Kiev would spot spy satellite</text>
  <text start="598.06" dur="4.8">imagery of where the enemies are</text>
  <text start="600.1" dur="5.01">positioned and we knew that they had it</text>
  <text start="602.86" dur="4.26">right over over right over where</text>
  <text start="605.11" dur="5.85">everything was going on and if Russia</text>
  <text start="607.12" dur="6.18">was actually bringing in tanks troops</text>
  <text start="610.96" dur="5.37">believe me the satellites would assume</text>
  <text start="613.3" dur="6.03">right in in color in 3d and it would</text>
  <text start="616.33" dur="5.28">have shown that Russia was in there but</text>
  <text start="619.33" dur="4.95">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to explain</text>
  <text start="621.61" dur="5.76">away why they give these black-and-white</text>
  <text start="624.28" dur="4.86">blurry pictures that you can&amp;#39;t make out</text>
  <text start="627.37" dur="5.28">at all because they&amp;#39;re afraid that</text>
  <text start="629.14" dur="5.88">Russia will figure out how good the</text>
  <text start="632.65" dur="5.67">satellites are well let me just ask you</text>
  <text start="635.02" dur="7.74">this these images that they&amp;#39;re giving us</text>
  <text start="638.32" dur="7.71">are worse than Google Images satellite</text>
  <text start="642.76" dur="7.38">images I mean I can go onto google earth</text>
  <text start="646.03" dur="7.05">and zoom in and get bad better images</text>
  <text start="650.14" dur="5.58">than the u.s. satellites I mean what</text>
  <text start="653.08" dur="4.68">does this tell us they&amp;#39;re doing this on</text>
  <text start="655.72" dur="4.38">purpose because they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="657.76" dur="6.24">evidence they could have just matched</text>
  <text start="660.1" dur="6.24">the Google Earth pictures and say okay</text>
  <text start="664" dur="4.98">we have the same technology as Google</text>
  <text start="666.34" dur="4.8">and here it is in color 3d we can zoom</text>
  <text start="668.98" dur="6.33">in really close we can even get street</text>
  <text start="671.14" dur="6.16">level but they don&amp;#39;t want to do that all</text>

  <text start="1097.49" dur="5.28">first stage into pushing a regime change</text>
  <text start="1100.46" dur="5.7">in this country because what happened</text>
  <text start="1102.77" dur="8.19">was Putin put together a peace plan back</text>

  <text start="1114.68" dur="4.38">the same thing that happened in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1116.72" dur="4.62">Putin stepped forth with a peace plan</text>
