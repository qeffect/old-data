  <text start="113.6" dur="4.23">seeing more and more these people get</text>
  <text start="115.01" dur="8.88">upset and we could be witnessing right</text>
  <text start="117.83" dur="7.95">now a revolution in France because what</text>
  <text start="123.89" dur="4.41">is happening here is the people are</text>
  <text start="125.78" dur="4.739">becoming more and more upset with their</text>
  <text start="128.3" dur="4.35">government and I&amp;#39;ve said this in the</text>
  <text start="130.519" dur="5.341">past when you push people to the</text>
  <text start="132.65" dur="5.79">breaking point you need to be very very</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="6.03">careful because when they all join hands</text>
  <text start="138.44" dur="6.21">and they&amp;#39;re all together it is a power</text>
  <text start="141.89" dur="5.79">and the government most likely at this</text>
  <text start="144.65" dur="5.04">point is getting nervous and when we see</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="5.37">more and more these protests occur a</text>
  <text start="149.69" dur="6.51">couple weeks between each one of them</text>
  <text start="153.05" dur="6.779">and more and more people join them we</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="5.129">start to realize well something is about</text>
  <text start="159.829" dur="4.201">to happen and we&amp;#39;re going to need to</text>
  <text start="161.329" dur="5.251">watch the situation very very carefully</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="4.53">and it out in North Korea we know the</text>
  <text start="166.58" dur="4.56">u.s. is putting a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="168.56" dur="6.899">North Korea US Treasury secretary Jack</text>
  <text start="171.14" dur="6.21">Lew said on Friday that global action is</text>
  <text start="175.459" dur="4.86">essential to increasing pressure on</text>
  <text start="177.35" dur="6.54">North Korea to drop its pursuit of</text>
  <text start="180.319" dur="5.041">nuclear weapons and what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="4.23">to do is they&amp;#39;re going to keep turning</text>
  <text start="185.36" dur="4.379">the screws until North Korea does</text>
  <text start="188.12" dur="3.66">something basically what he&amp;#39;s saying is</text>
  <text start="189.739" dur="5.041">let&amp;#39;s continually put pressure on North</text>
  <text start="191.78" dur="5.04">Korea and we would like to have a regime</text>
  <text start="194.78" dur="4.14">change there we would like to provoke</text>
  <text start="196.82" dur="4.68">them maybe start war whatever we</text>
  <text start="198.92" dur="4.83">possibly can do this is what we want to</text>
  <text start="201.5" dur="4.5">do because the whole goal of the US</text>
  <text start="203.75" dur="3.51">government central bankers is to go into</text>
  <text start="206" dur="3.39">each and every one of these countries</text>
  <text start="207.26" dur="3.54">and overthrow the government&amp;#39;s and put</text>
  <text start="209.39" dur="3.33">in a public government if they can do</text>
  <text start="210.8" dur="4.11">this in Russia and China in North Korea</text>
  <text start="212.72" dur="4.89">Iran Syria and all the rest of the</text>
  <text start="214.91" dur="4.79">countries Brazil Venezuela they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="217.61" dur="4.62">they there would be no need for war</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="5.35">because they would be creating a</text>
  <text start="222.23" dur="5.22">one-world government and then they could</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="5.88">do whatever they want but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.45" dur="5.28">seeing right now is that other countries</text>
  <text start="230.93" dur="5.01">are saying you know we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="232.73" dur="5.759">join is that the central banking system</text>
  <text start="235.94" dur="6.09">here in the United States that is</text>
  <text start="238.489" dur="7.111">controlling the dollar they want to keep</text>
  <text start="242.03" dur="6.12">what they have and to make this</text>
  <text start="245.6" dur="3.75">transition they know they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="248.15" dur="4.2">to be able to have regime change in</text>
  <text start="249.35" dur="5.55">every single one of these countries to</text>
  <text start="252.35" dur="6.65">make it look like they&amp;#39;re starting fresh</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="6.45">and new they&amp;#39;re going to create war</text>
  <text start="259" dur="5.05">because after the war they say oh look</text>
  <text start="261.35" dur="5.7">everything is damaged infrastructure is</text>
  <text start="264.05" dur="6.989">destroyed we need to rebuild we need a</text>
  <text start="267.05" dur="6.6">new monetary system and this is what</text>
  <text start="271.039" dur="5.011">they&amp;#39;re pushing for right now and we can</text>
  <text start="273.65" dur="5.49">see in the Middle East we can see in</text>
  <text start="276.05" dur="6.06">Eastern Europe in the Pacific they are</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="8.31">continually provoking these areas to get</text>
  <text start="282.11" dur="6.66">this war started now out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="287.45" dur="2.91">see the United States and Ukraine</text>
  <text start="288.77" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;ve signed an agreement granting Kip</text>
  <text start="290.36" dur="5.429">a third tranche of a guaranteed loan of</text>
  <text start="292.7" dur="4.77">1 billion dollars I just put them</text>
  <text start="295.789" dur="7.911">further and further into debt</text>
  <text start="297.47" dur="9.84">we see Ukraine and NATO they have</text>
  <text start="303.7" dur="6.46">confirmed a roadmap of NATO Ukraine</text>
  <text start="307.31" dur="4.62">defense technical cooperation and was</text>
  <text start="310.16" dur="4.08">approved during the meeting of NATO and</text>
  <text start="311.93" dur="5.31">Ukraine Joint Working Group on defense</text>
  <text start="314.24" dur="4.38">and technical cooperation the sides</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="3.27">discussed the provisions of the state</text>
  <text start="318.62" dur="3.69">target defense program on weapons and</text>
  <text start="320.51" dur="5.19">military equipment development for the</text>
  <text start="322.31" dur="8.22">period until 2020 so we can see already</text>
  <text start="325.7" dur="7.38">NATO is moving into the crane space we</text>
  <text start="330.53" dur="6.3">see that they want the entire country</text>
  <text start="333.08" dur="6.27">they want the port and this is why we</text>
  <text start="336.83" dur="7.23">see a build-up for this major offensive</text>
  <text start="339.35" dur="7.98">to the southeastern people we see the UN</text>
  <text start="344.06" dur="7.17">is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="347.33" dur="6.15">Ukraine spy agency the SBU is rounding</text>
  <text start="351.23" dur="6.09">up and torturing suspected rebel</text>
  <text start="353.48" dur="5.67">sympathizers and the UN assistant</text>
  <text start="357.32" dur="4.95">secretary general for Human Rights said</text>
  <text start="359.15" dur="5.66">that in some areas Kiev&amp;#39;s disregard for</text>
  <text start="362.27" dur="4.98">human rights have become entrenched and</text>
  <text start="364.81" dur="7.93">systemic and needed to be urgently</text>
  <text start="367.25" dur="7.95">addressed now they have hundreds of</text>
  <text start="372.74" dur="5.88">cases of illegal detentions torture and</text>
  <text start="375.2" dur="6.24">ill-treatment of these detainees now</text>
  <text start="378.62" dur="5.31">think about this for a second the US UK</text>
  <text start="381.44" dur="3.93">and other countries are in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="383.93" dur="7.92">helping them with their police force</text>
  <text start="385.37" dur="8.46">with their armed forces and the US has</text>
  <text start="391.85" dur="3.87">no problem with this the UK has no</text>
  <text start="393.83" dur="4.68">problem with this they know what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="395.72" dur="6.54">on inside of Ukraine and if you take a</text>
  <text start="398.51" dur="9.03">look at the other countries they have no</text>
  <text start="402.26" dur="8.01">problem with torture or ill treating the</text>
  <text start="407.54" dur="6.9">people of the countries I mean the US</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="6.66">has secret prisons or prisons outside of</text>
  <text start="414.44" dur="4.41">the US where they keep people there they</text>
  <text start="416.93" dur="7.049">don&amp;#39;t have any due process they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="11.159">tortured so we can see this is what the</text>
  <text start="423.979" dur="10.981">u.s. does now poulan</text>
  <text start="430.009" dur="9.06">they are planning a 35,000 strong</text>
  <text start="434.96" dur="7.319">paramilitary force to deter the Russian</text>
  <text start="439.069" dur="5.49">threat now it&amp;#39;s going to be formed in</text>
  <text start="442.279" dur="5.22">Palma Poland to enhance their military</text>
  <text start="444.559" dur="6.051">capabilities as part of the preparations</text>
  <text start="447.499" dur="5.28">for a possible hybrid war with Russia</text>
  <text start="450.61" dur="4.479">the new force is going to be comprised</text>
  <text start="452.779" dur="6.181">of about 35,000 civilian volunteers and</text>
  <text start="455.089" dur="5.85">will undergo military training and then</text>
  <text start="458.96" dur="3.419">each polish province they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="460.939" dur="4.44">receive about one brigade of the</text>
  <text start="462.379" dur="5.46">territorial defense force consisting of</text>
  <text start="465.379" dur="5.01">these volunteers and we can see all the</text>
  <text start="467.839" dur="4.41">countries around this area guess what</text>
  <text start="470.389" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.249" dur="7.831">getting prepared for war and war is</text>
  <text start="476.809" dur="5.07">coming the US government the central</text>
  <text start="480.08" dur="5.729">bankers have been preparing for this for</text>
  <text start="481.879" dur="6.12">quite a while slowly but surely they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="485.809" dur="4.801">been moving military assets in the</text>
  <text start="487.999" dur="6.14">Pacific in Eastern Europe in the Middle</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="6.809">East and Africa setting up the bases</text>
  <text start="494.139" dur="5.83">bringing in the troops using whatever</text>
  <text start="497.419" dur="5.571">excuse they&amp;#39;d have to use to continually</text>
  <text start="499.969" dur="7.2">bring in this equipment and troops and</text>
  <text start="502.99" dur="7.239">they&amp;#39;ve done this over time slowly but</text>
  <text start="507.169" dur="5.691">surely because they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="510.229" dur="6.211">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for war and</text>
  <text start="512.86" dur="7.75">we&amp;#39;re at that point where everything is</text>
  <text start="516.44" dur="5.67">in place we&amp;#39;re at that point where</text>
  <text start="520.61" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re provoking and if you notice</text>
  <text start="522.11" dur="7.229">they&amp;#39;re provoking more often now if you</text>
  <text start="526.88" dur="5.42">notice they&amp;#39;re trying to accelerate the</text>
  <text start="529.339" dur="5.25">process because the economy is failing</text>
  <text start="532.3" dur="7.89">they know it&amp;#39;s going to be collapsing</text>
  <text start="534.589" dur="9.48">and they need war to be pushed forward</text>
  <text start="540.19" dur="6.459">anyway they possibly can and this will</text>
  <text start="544.069" dur="5.431">accelerate as we go towards the end of</text>
  <text start="546.649" dur="6.42">this year as the economy continually</text>
  <text start="549.5" dur="5.73">collapses it&amp;#39;s going to build up and</text>
  <text start="553.069" dur="5.88">build up and we&amp;#39;re going to see more of</text>
  <text start="555.23" dur="6.81">this now out in Yemen we see that Saudi</text>
  <text start="558.949" dur="4.951">Arabia United Arab Emirates the</text>
  <text start="562.04" dur="4.53">Blackwater mercenaries which</text>
  <text start="563.9" dur="4.2">acad they&amp;#39;re having a very tough time</text>
  <text start="566.57" dur="6.05">with the hootie &amp;amp; the hoot these right</text>
  <text start="568.1" dur="8.21">now they have retaken central Yemen and</text>
  <text start="572.62" dur="7.92">they&amp;#39;ve overrun the pro Saudi forces and</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="7.87">at this point the whole entire mission</text>
  <text start="580.54" dur="5.83">to get the people to pay for kicking out</text>
  <text start="584.18" dur="4.47">the puppet government it is not working</text>
  <text start="586.37" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s why the u.s. is in Yemen with</text>
  <text start="588.65" dur="4.2">special forces with the cover story that</text>
  <text start="591.53" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re going after al Qaeda and</text>
  <text start="592.85" dur="6.47">remember when we look at these countries</text>
  <text start="596.06" dur="6.39">and the US wants to have the government</text>
  <text start="599.32" dur="5.02">overthrown they use al-qaeda they use</text>

  <text start="621.92" dur="7.01">is a terrorist and they can use drone</text>
  <text start="624.83" dur="8.4">strikes on those individuals and we</text>
  <text start="628.93" dur="7.39">realize that the u.s. they support all</text>
  <text start="633.23" dur="5.91">of these terrorist groups and they use</text>
  <text start="636.32" dur="5.46">them any way they want to use them now</text>
  <text start="639.14" dur="4.98">out in Syria we realize that the u.s. is</text>

  <text start="829.85" dur="1.69">very interesting about all of this and I</text>
  <text start="831.11" dur="2.919">mentioned</text>
  <text start="831.54" dur="6.15">before that is that the US Treasury they</text>
  <text start="834.029" dur="6.631">can keep exact figures on how much the</text>

  <text start="868.86" dur="5.279">carrier to the Mediterranean they</text>
  <text start="871.29" dur="5.93">realized that the u.s. they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="874.139" dur="5.041">something because we see right now that</text>

  <text start="994.47" dur="6.18">opposition must leave terrorist</text>
  <text start="996.75" dur="10.14">positions because we long have agreed on</text>

  <text start="1006.89" dur="6.51">looks like and this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="1008.93" dur="10.38">veterans today the US has a secret plan</text>

  <text start="1045.89" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re setting everything up for what</text>
