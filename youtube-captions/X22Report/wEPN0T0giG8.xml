  <text start="54.39" dur="4.89">in these countries that are protesting</text>
  <text start="57.239" dur="5.041">their sick and tired of austerity I mean</text>
  <text start="59.28" dur="5.909">we see thousands in Montreal they have</text>

  <text start="74.18" dur="7.56">anniversary of the balance the Cypriot</text>
  <text start="79.5" dur="5.58">people were out there and they were</text>
  <text start="81.74" dur="5.769">stoning the bank of cyprus because you</text>
  <text start="85.08" dur="5.73">have to remember during that period of</text>
  <text start="87.509" dur="5.61">time the Cypriot people went to sleep on</text>
  <text start="90.81" dur="3.84">Friday they woke up on Saturday and all</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="2.731">of sudden capital controls were in</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="4.23">effect they couldn&amp;#39;t get their money out</text>
  <text start="95.85" dur="6.3">and the government the central bankers</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="5.879">were telling them that they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="102.15" dur="6.899">have to take some of their hard-earned</text>
  <text start="104.759" dur="5.82">money currency and they will give them</text>
  <text start="109.049" dur="3.991">the bank stock because the banks are</text>
  <text start="110.579" dur="3.991">insolvent well what what is what does</text>
  <text start="113.04" dur="3.84">the bank stock is going to do pretty</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="3.99">much nothing and they told them at that</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="4.05">point in time that they were only going</text>
  <text start="118.56" dur="5.19">to take about eight to ten percent and</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="6.03">it turned out on average they took forty</text>
  <text start="123.75" dur="6.3">seven percent and the capital controls</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="5.16">were in effect for a very long time over</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="3.42">a year they couldn&amp;#39;t transfer any money</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="5.43">out of the country</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="7.43">they couldn&amp;#39;t take out their currency</text>
  <text start="137.55" dur="6.33">and a lot of businesses a lot of people</text>
  <text start="140.9" dur="6.7">suffered and are continually suffering</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="8.37">as of today things have not just</text>
  <text start="147.6" dur="6.51">automatically improved when people or i</text>
  <text start="152.25" dur="4.02">should say the central bank comes in and</text>
  <text start="154.11" dur="5.49">out where the government comes in and</text>
  <text start="156.27" dur="5.91">takes your hard-earned money almost half</text>
  <text start="159.6" dur="4.56">of it you just can&amp;#39;t bounce back because</text>
  <text start="162.18" dur="5.48">this affected a lot of different things</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="7.13">and we&amp;#39;re seeing this throughout europe</text>
  <text start="167.66" dur="6.94">that all these countries that are</text>
  <text start="171.29" dur="7.03">working with austerity they&amp;#39;re finding</text>
  <text start="174.6" dur="6.06">it very difficult to survive and as time</text>
  <text start="178.32" dur="5.01">goes on it doesn&amp;#39;t get better it gets</text>
  <text start="180.66" dur="4.56">worse and this is why all these</text>
  <text start="183.33" dur="4.25">countries are protesting saying enough</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="4.92">is enough here in the united states</text>
  <text start="187.58" dur="4.39">there&amp;#39;s a different different story</text>
  <text start="190.14" dur="3.69">going on right here there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="191.97" dur="6.48">continually pushing the illusion that</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="7.53">we&amp;#39;re in this recovery and doing this</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="6.45">report that i&amp;#39;m doing is showing people</text>
  <text start="201.36" dur="6.42">that things are breaking down every</text>
  <text start="204.9" dur="5.22">single day and i know there&amp;#39;s people out</text>
  <text start="207.78" dur="4.53">there saying well look in this area if</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="4.08">things are fine well it doesn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="6.959">in every single area all at the same</text>
  <text start="214.2" dur="8.73">time it spreads very slowly and we can</text>
  <text start="219.269" dur="5.731">see that manufacturing is down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="4.95">declining we see the Baltic Dry Index at</text>
  <text start="225" dur="8.58">its lowest point in a very very long</text>
  <text start="227.88" dur="7.94">time it&amp;#39;s actually more than half three</text>
  <text start="233.58" dur="4.83">times less than it was last year and</text>
  <text start="235.82" dur="4.21">that shows us that people aren&amp;#39;t taking</text>
  <text start="238.41" dur="4.62">their disposable income going out and</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="4.56">buying goods and if they&amp;#39;re not buying</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="3.48">goods the factories do not have to</text>
  <text start="244.59" dur="3.06">produce anything the factories don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="4.47">have to produce anything they don&amp;#39;t eat</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="5.76">the raw materials and we see that the</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="4.56">richmond fed manufacturing survey has</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="5.46">completely collapsed it means that a</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="6.72">two-year low at this point printing at a</text>
  <text start="258.87" dur="7.53">disastrous negative eight they were</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="4.89">expecting a positive three richmond fed</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="3.48">is the</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="4.769">since January of 2013 the last five</text>
  <text start="269.88" dur="5.73">months have seen the index drop at its</text>
  <text start="271.919" dur="6.271">fastest rate since Lehman so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="275.61" dur="5.64">looking at is something where things are</text>
  <text start="278.19" dur="5.16">completely collapsing yes at certain</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="6.05">times they bump up but the downward</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="6.15">trend is there and its continuing</text>
  <text start="287.3" dur="4.27">they&amp;#39;re continually telling us that no</text>
  <text start="289.5" dur="5.19">prices are not rising everything is</text>
  <text start="291.57" dur="5.79">falling gas prices have calmed down I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="294.69" dur="4.74">come down quite a bit they&amp;#39;re picking up</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="5.04">right now you&amp;#39;re starting to move up a</text>
  <text start="299.43" dur="4.98">little bit here and you would think</text>
  <text start="302.4" dur="4.95">because gas prices have come down food</text>
  <text start="304.41" dur="5.52">would drop and other things would fall</text>
  <text start="307.35" dur="6.08">but we&amp;#39;re seeing that no consumer prices</text>
  <text start="309.93" dur="7.859">rose by 0.2% the most since mate of</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="6.13">since May of 2014 and when we look at</text>
  <text start="317.789" dur="3.591">this the food index increased by point</text>
  <text start="319.56" dur="3.96">two percent in February the index for</text>
  <text start="321.38" dur="4.599">non-alcoholic beverages increased by</text>
  <text start="323.52" dur="4.95">point six percent in February it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="325.979" dur="5.461">largest since September of 2012 the</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="5.94">index for beef and veal rose by for bio</text>
  <text start="331.44" dur="7.47">point seven percent its 13th consecutive</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="10.939">increase fresh fruits increased by point</text>
  <text start="338.91" dur="10.71">six percent we are seeing inflation on</text>
  <text start="345.349" dur="7.721">items that you need every single day yes</text>
  <text start="349.62" dur="5.76">are they suppressing gas yes they are</text>
  <text start="353.07" dur="4.89">but we see that the numbers now are</text>
  <text start="355.38" dur="5.4">ticking up they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="357.96" dur="6.329">that real estate is in a complete</text>
  <text start="360.78" dur="7.139">recovery even though we see mortgage</text>
  <text start="364.289" dur="4.891">applications declining we see people</text>
  <text start="367.919" dur="4.981">being laid off in the mortgage</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="5.04">departments and right now the United</text>
  <text start="372.9" dur="3.15">States government central bankers have</text>
  <text start="374.22" dur="6.39">come out with their new statistics and</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re kind of ridiculous because what</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us during the</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="4.169">same time that housing starts in</text>
  <text start="384.09" dur="4.62">existing home sales completely missed</text>
  <text start="386.729" dur="4.261">all their expectations and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.71" dur="4.53">declining and of course they blame that</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="4.08">on the bad weather the Census Bureau</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="5.28">moments ago released a stunner of new</text>
  <text start="395.07" dur="6.03">home sales numbers which supposedly rose</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="7.5">from an upward revised 500,000</text>
  <text start="401.1" dur="6.45">to 530 9000 smashing the expectations of</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="3.48">only four hundred eighty-one thousand</text>
  <text start="407.55" dur="5.34">and this was during the bad weather</text>
  <text start="409.5" dur="6.33">period so this is a 25-percent spike</text>
  <text start="412.89" dur="7.05">from a year ago and up seven point eight</text>
  <text start="415.83" dur="7.8">percent from January but when we look at</text>
  <text start="419.94" dur="6.63">this we see that yeah what they do is</text>
  <text start="423.63" dur="4.29">they give us these manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="426.57" dur="3.87">right now trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="427.92" dur="6.63">real estate is on the rise and then they</text>
  <text start="430.44" dur="7.71">go back and they manipulate the numbers</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="7.44">and they revise them downward when no</text>
  <text start="438.15" dur="5.82">one&amp;#39;s paying attention the census always</text>
  <text start="441.99" dur="3.96">admits in the fine print that ninety</text>
  <text start="443.97" dur="4.44">percent of confidence interval on the</text>
  <text start="445.95" dur="6.87">seven point eight increase is plus or</text>
  <text start="448.41" dur="8.4">minus fifteen point two percent and we</text>
  <text start="452.82" dur="6.33">continually see them downward revise the</text>
  <text start="456.81" dur="4.41">data for the six months in a row and</text>
  <text start="459.15" dur="3.99">when we look at the graphs and we look</text>
  <text start="461.22" dur="5.31">at everything we see yes they go back</text>
  <text start="463.14" dur="6.21">for example may of 2014 they told us</text>
  <text start="466.53" dur="5.88">that oh yes the sales were up at 504</text>
  <text start="469.35" dur="6.06">they revised them down to 458 they told</text>
  <text start="472.41" dur="6.09">us back in August of 2014 the sales were</text>
  <text start="475.41" dur="4.83">up and they were at five hundred and</text>
  <text start="478.5" dur="3.21">four thousand then they revised it down</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="5.1">to four hundred and forty eight thousand</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="5.22">and this is continually on going because</text>
  <text start="485.34" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everything</text>
  <text start="486.93" dur="5.19">that everything is okay the new home</text>
  <text start="490.5" dur="5.1">sales in February in the northeast rose</text>
  <text start="492.12" dur="5.88">from 17,000 to 43,000 during the bad</text>
  <text start="495.6" dur="4.35">weather period that&amp;#39;s an increase of a</text>
  <text start="498" dur="4.53">hundred and fifty three hundred and</text>
  <text start="499.95" dur="6.78">fifty three percent does that make any</text>
  <text start="502.53" dur="6.9">sense so I decided because people are</text>
  <text start="506.73" dur="5.22">trying to convince me that no real</text>
  <text start="509.43" dur="7.95">estate is doing well and I have to go</text>
  <text start="511.95" dur="6.54">back once again to 2007-2008 when I was</text>
  <text start="517.38" dur="3.63">trying to sell my house i live in new</text>
  <text start="518.49" dur="4.41">york and all of a sudden the traffic</text>
  <text start="521.01" dur="3.45">just completely dried up I nobody know</text>
  <text start="522.9" dur="4.2">what was going on what is happening here</text>
  <text start="524.46" dur="4.44">and I spoke to my sister and all that</text>
  <text start="527.1" dur="3.72">was in real estate I said are you seeing</text>
  <text start="528.9" dur="4.77">the same thing I&amp;#39;m saying because in the</text>
  <text start="530.82" dur="3.87">last six months there is no traffic to</text>
  <text start="533.67" dur="2.55">the houses</text>
  <text start="534.69" dur="4.02">prior to that there were tons of people</text>
  <text start="536.22" dur="4.56">all of a sudden nothing is going on and</text>
  <text start="538.71" dur="3.9">I see house prices starting to drop and</text>
  <text start="540.78" dur="3.33">they my sister in law in Florida said no</text>
  <text start="542.61" dur="3.12">oh my god everything&amp;#39;s booming here I</text>
  <text start="544.11" dur="3.48">can&amp;#39;t believe it we can&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;re writing</text>
  <text start="545.73" dur="4.56">contracts left and right people are</text>
  <text start="547.59" dur="6.24">bidding up it&amp;#39;s crazy well guess what</text>
  <text start="550.29" dur="7.17">happened eight to nine months later all</text>
  <text start="553.83" dur="6.48">of a sudden in Florida things came to a</text>
  <text start="557.46" dur="4.77">screeching halt now things do not happen</text>
  <text start="560.31" dur="4.23">all at once with that I mean that would</text>
  <text start="562.23" dur="4.32">be incredible if it did but what happens</text>
  <text start="564.54" dur="4.62">is it starts in certain areas and then</text>
  <text start="566.55" dur="5.82">it spreads a little bit further because</text>
  <text start="569.16" dur="5.03">what&amp;#39;s happening is the US government</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="4.29">central bankers are in these areas</text>
  <text start="574.19" dur="4.21">keeping the bubble going they can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="576.66" dur="5.97">into every single area it&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="578.4" dur="7.35">impossible so we see areas start to</text>
