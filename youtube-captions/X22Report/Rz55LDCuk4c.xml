  <text start="109.35" dur="4.439">we&amp;#39;ve been showing that the EU has been</text>
  <text start="111.09" dur="6.12">pushing back quite a bit right now now</text>
  <text start="113.789" dur="5.76">we have George Soros he has asked the</text>

  <text start="129.989" dur="5.37">group best for Britain and of course</text>
  <text start="132.329" dur="4.951">every time we hear something where</text>
  <text start="135.359" dur="4.111">they&amp;#39;re saying oh it&amp;#39;s the best for you</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;re a patriot always think the</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="4.56">opposite this is not the best for</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="4.14">Britain it&amp;#39;s actually the opposite think</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="4.89">mirror and I&amp;#39;ve been saying this for a</text>
  <text start="146.01" dur="4.89">very long time every time these deep</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="4.02">state operatives the central bank comes</text>
  <text start="150.9" dur="5.309">out to say something always think the</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="6.18">opposite of what it really means so the</text>
  <text start="156.209" dur="4.53">Soros back group best for Britain said</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="3.56">it hopes to reverse the will of the</text>
  <text start="160.739" dur="5.461">British people by targeting voters in</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="6.01">swing constituencies while</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="7.259">simultaneously exploring every legal</text>
  <text start="168.69" dur="7.44">Avenue available to them now Soros also</text>
  <text start="173.459" dur="4.801">partnered with a group called Hope which</text>
  <text start="176.13" dur="3.53">really means hate most likely because</text>
  <text start="178.26" dur="4.349">we&amp;#39;re always thinking the opposite and</text>
  <text start="179.66" dur="5.64">they received the support from Soros</text>
  <text start="182.609" dur="4.161">they&amp;#39;re open his open foundation</text>
  <text start="185.3" dur="5.07">and it looks like what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="186.77" dur="6.75">do is they&amp;#39;re trying to push a new vote</text>
  <text start="190.37" dur="5.73">to vote away this whole brexit nightmare</text>
  <text start="193.52" dur="5.61">and we can see that they are ready to do</text>
  <text start="196.1" dur="5.97">about almost anything to stop this from</text>
  <text start="199.13" dur="3.86">happening we see here in the United</text>
  <text start="202.07" dur="3.66">States</text>
  <text start="202.99" dur="6.22">mortgage rates they have jumped to</text>
  <text start="205.73" dur="4.26">four-month highs as housing market hits</text>
  <text start="209.21" dur="2.85">a bump</text>
  <text start="209.99" dur="4.29">now mortgage rates are moving up right</text>
  <text start="212.06" dur="4.68">now when the Fed raises the interest</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="6.03">rates again in September this month and</text>
  <text start="216.74" dur="6">probably in December and throughout next</text>
  <text start="220.31" dur="5.25">year the real estate market is going to</text>
  <text start="222.74" dur="5.61">completely implode now wolf Richter has</text>
  <text start="225.56" dur="5.1">been looking at the yield curve and he</text>
  <text start="228.35" dur="4.8">put together a really great report</text>
  <text start="230.66" dur="4.83">showing where the yield curve is now</text>
  <text start="233.15" dur="4.29">where it is headed and why it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="235.49" dur="3.27">important and remember the Fed was out</text>
  <text start="237.44" dur="2.91">there saying that they would like to do</text>
  <text start="238.76" dur="4.05">away with the yield curve or we</text>
  <text start="240.35" dur="5.55">calculate the yield curve because they</text>
  <text start="242.81" dur="7.47">know this shows exactly what is going on</text>
  <text start="245.9" dur="7.38">in the economy and this starts off to</text>
  <text start="250.28" dur="6.09">say all bull markets come to an end even</text>
  <text start="253.28" dur="6">the 35 year great bond bull market right</text>
  <text start="256.37" dur="4.739">now the US Treasury two-year yield crept</text>
  <text start="259.28" dur="4.44">up about 3 basis points during this week</text>
  <text start="261.109" dur="5.041">to about two point eight one percent at</text>
  <text start="263.72" dur="5.94">the close on Friday this is the highest</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="6.51">since June of 2008 in the month or two</text>
  <text start="269.66" dur="5.28">as the fourth rate hike for 2018 and</text>
  <text start="272.66" dur="5.52">more rate hikes next year are getting</text>
  <text start="274.94" dur="6">further baked into the equation here the</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="6.72">two-year yield will cross the 3 percent</text>
  <text start="280.94" dur="5.52">mark just two years ago many people out</text>
  <text start="284.9" dur="3.36">there financial pundits were saying</text>
  <text start="286.46" dur="4.23">listen and the all these people are you</text>
  <text start="288.26" dur="4.83">know on TV MSNBC and the rest saying</text>
  <text start="290.69" dur="4.74">this would never happen again that the</text>
  <text start="293.09" dur="4.95">Fed in fact can never raise rates to</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="6.66">this point but guess what here we are</text>
  <text start="298.04" dur="7.08">once again and when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="302.09" dur="7.23">can see that we are very very close to</text>
  <text start="305.12" dur="8.07">an inverted yield curve and we&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="309.32" dur="6.719">close we&amp;#39;re at like 0.25 and once it</text>
  <text start="313.19" dur="5.67">hits zero and go below that guess what</text>
  <text start="316.039" dur="3.21">it is game over and if we go back in</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="4.949">time</text>
  <text start="319.249" dur="6.75">to like 2006 and 2007 the two-year yield</text>
  <text start="323.809" dur="4.41">was higher than the 10-year yield and</text>
  <text start="325.999" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s the what happened there is the</text>
  <text start="328.219" dur="5.43">yield curve then inverted so if we look</text>
  <text start="330.979" dur="5.76">back in time we can see that this</text>
  <text start="333.649" dur="8.01">scenario has played out many many times</text>
  <text start="336.739" dur="8.58">before where once the yield curve is</text>
  <text start="341.659" dur="6.72">inverted what follows is a recession and</text>
  <text start="345.319" dur="7.65">when we go back in time and we look at</text>
  <text start="348.379" dur="7.981">2006 2007 boom we had an inverted yield</text>
  <text start="352.969" dur="5.79">curve if we go back to 2001 boom we had</text>
  <text start="356.36" dur="7.439">an inverted yield curve here we are at</text>
  <text start="358.759" dur="8.06">2018 we are so close to an an inverted</text>
  <text start="363.799" dur="6.93">yield curve right now it is nearly flat</text>
  <text start="366.819" dur="6.58">so the recession is coming and we know</text>
  <text start="370.729" dur="4.53">that we are headed towards a transition</text>
  <text start="373.399" dur="4.26">and we need to put this in context</text>
  <text start="375.259" dur="4.77">remember the economy is being boosted up</text>
  <text start="377.659" dur="3.6">and manipulated by all the tools the</text>
  <text start="380.029" dur="4.23">central bank and the deep state have</text>
  <text start="381.259" dur="5.01">been using in the past this is what</text>
  <text start="384.259" dur="4.92">Trump is doing right now so this way he</text>
  <text start="386.269" dur="6.45">can&amp;#39;t be blamed for the entire system</text>
  <text start="389.179" dur="5.28">falling apart Powell and Trump I do</text>
  <text start="392.719" dur="5.22">believe they are working together and</text>
  <text start="394.459" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re raising the rates to bring this</text>
  <text start="397.939" dur="4.29">entire system down and of course what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.489" dur="3.84">going to happen is everything&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="402.229" dur="4.89">blamed on the central bank we know that</text>
  <text start="404.329" dur="5.22">Trump has been out there contradicting</text>
  <text start="407.119" dur="4.83">not just the Fed but the World Trade</text>
  <text start="409.549" dur="4.8">Organization and redoing all the trade</text>
  <text start="411.949" dur="5.1">deals with many different countries or</text>
  <text start="414.349" dur="5.67">getting rid of the globalist trade deals</text>
  <text start="417.049" dur="5.61">or renegotiating the global trade deals</text>
  <text start="420.019" dur="5.22">now we understand that the world trade</text>
  <text start="422.659" dur="4.41">organization is the central bank the</text>
  <text start="425.239" dur="4.56">globalist system to keep everything</text>
  <text start="427.069" dur="4.95">centralized and we know eventually that</text>
  <text start="429.799" dur="5.07">either the World Trade Organization has</text>
  <text start="432.019" dur="8.04">to disappear or everything has to be</text>
  <text start="434.869" dur="8.37">redone so it works with the new system</text>
  <text start="440.059" dur="4.41">now it&amp;#39;s not just the United States or</text>
  <text start="443.239" dur="1.92">Trump calling out the World Trade</text>
  <text start="444.469" dur="8.191">Organization</text>
  <text start="445.159" dur="10.201">it seems that Russia China Brazil India</text>
  <text start="452.66" dur="6.15">South Africa and the rest of the BRIC</text>
  <text start="455.36" dur="6.66">nations they&amp;#39;re all out there and they</text>
  <text start="458.81" dur="6.24">all have a common position on the world</text>
  <text start="462.02" dur="5.18">trade organization they want amendments</text>
  <text start="465.05" dur="4.95">they want changes in the World Trade</text>
  <text start="467.2" dur="6.13">Organization and several countries</text>
  <text start="470" dur="7.17">criticize the ineffectiveness of the WTO</text>
  <text start="473.33" dur="6.06">system remember in August Trump</text>
  <text start="477.17" dur="5.91">suggested that the u.s. might leave the</text>
  <text start="479.39" dur="6.21">WTO if there were no changes now Trump</text>
  <text start="483.08" dur="6">said the WTO has been treating the</text>
  <text start="485.6" dur="6.84">United States very badly for years BRICS</text>
  <text start="489.08" dur="6.27">are saying the same exact thing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="7.2">all on the same page and then we have to</text>
  <text start="495.35" dur="7.32">go back to is Xi Jinping is Putin are</text>
  <text start="499.64" dur="7.08">they all working together to bring down</text>
  <text start="502.67" dur="5.97">the central bank apparatus yeah because</text>
  <text start="506.72" dur="3.81">every single indicator that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="508.64" dur="6.18">looking at is pointing in that direction</text>
  <text start="510.53" dur="5.79">and we see that Powell again is raising</text>
  <text start="514.82" dur="3">the rates now of course Trump came out</text>
  <text start="516.32" dur="2.55">and contradicted the Fed saying I</text>
  <text start="517.82" dur="1.529">thought this was going to be an easy</text>
  <text start="518.87" dur="2.609">money</text>
  <text start="519.349" dur="3.811">Fed Chairman I didn&amp;#39;t realize he was</text>
  <text start="521.479" dur="3.151">going to be an interest rate Fed</text>
  <text start="523.16" dur="3.24">Chairman and this is exactly what he</text>
  <text start="524.63" dur="4.74">wanted he&amp;#39;s using reserve reverse</text>
  <text start="526.4" dur="5.52">psychology on the deep straight the deep</text>
  <text start="529.37" dur="4.47">State the mainstream media to make them</text>
  <text start="531.92" dur="4.05">think that you know he&amp;#39;s not with Powell</text>
  <text start="533.84" dur="4.05">but the opposite is actually happening</text>
  <text start="535.97" dur="5.01">we see that other countries now are</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="4.89">backing up the claims of Trump saying we</text>
  <text start="540.98" dur="4.23">need to redo the World Trade</text>
  <text start="542.78" dur="5.94">Organization because when this system is</text>
  <text start="545.21" dur="5.79">reset the new system does not work with</text>
  <text start="548.72" dur="4.77">the old central bank globalist system</text>
  <text start="551" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s why everything is being changed</text>
  <text start="553.49" dur="4.59">right now that&amp;#39;s why we see bilateral</text>
  <text start="556.19" dur="5.34">trade agreements that&amp;#39;s why we see the</text>
  <text start="558.08" dur="6.09">globalist trade deals being dismantled</text>
  <text start="561.53" dur="5.21">this is why they&amp;#39;re calling out the WTO</text>
  <text start="564.17" dur="6.18">this is why the contradicting the Fed</text>
  <text start="566.74" dur="6.16">this will continue because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.35" dur="6.06">preparing everything and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="572.9" dur="5.76">everything ready to break away from the</text>
  <text start="576.41" dur="4.41">central banking establishment everything</text>
  <text start="578.66" dur="3.6">that they put in place over the many</text>
  <text start="580.82" dur="3.48">many years with the deep state the</text>
  <text start="582.26" dur="4.24">globalists and everything else to create</text>
  <text start="584.3" dur="5.66">this one-world centralized system</text>
  <text start="586.5" dur="6.25">everything is now changing everything is</text>
  <text start="589.96" dur="4.74">now gonna be decentralized that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="592.75" dur="4.62">Russia once again is out there saying</text>
  <text start="594.7" dur="5.49">every single country should use their</text>
  <text start="597.37" dur="7.2">national currency separate and apart</text>
  <text start="600.19" dur="7.98">from a central bank currency which is</text>
  <text start="604.57" dur="6.69">centralized among many nations and we</text>
  <text start="608.17" dur="5.43">can see that the European leaders they</text>
  <text start="611.26" dur="3.78">are looking at the EU looking at the</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="5.7">central bank saying you know something</text>
  <text start="615.04" dur="7.08">maybe we should move away and go back to</text>
  <text start="619.3" dur="4.25">our national currencies and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="622.12" dur="4.14">talking about this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="623.55" dur="4.87">Greece has been talking about this Italy</text>
  <text start="626.26" dur="4.53">has been talking about this Spain has</text>
  <text start="628.42" dur="4.41">been talking about this and eventually</text>
  <text start="630.79" dur="4.08">what&amp;#39;s going to happen just like with</text>
  <text start="632.83" dur="3.99">the immigration crisis countries are</text>
  <text start="634.87" dur="3.69">gonna stay whoa just a minute we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="636.82" dur="3.18">agree with this a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="638.56" dur="3.81">didn&amp;#39;t agree with the immigration</text>
  <text start="640" dur="4.29">process of the EU where they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="642.37" dur="5.4">up all the refugees the same thing is</text>
  <text start="644.29" dur="5.31">gonna happen with the central bank</text>
  <text start="647.77" dur="4.47">currency eventually what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="649.6" dur="5.19">to say is now it&amp;#39;s time to break away</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="6.51">remember everything is changing right</text>
  <text start="654.79" dur="7.5">now the power is being brought back to</text>
  <text start="658.75" dur="6.69">the people the days of the central bank</text>
  <text start="662.29" dur="6.45">the deep state the globalists those days</text>
  <text start="665.44" dur="6.42">are over and as more and more people</text>
  <text start="668.74" dur="5.58">wake up as more more countries take</text>
  <text start="671.86" dur="3.87">control of their system and remove those</text>
  <text start="674.32" dur="3.87">leaders that are in line with the</text>
  <text start="675.73" dur="5.31">central bank in the deep state well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="678.19" dur="4.59">game over and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="681.04" dur="4.98">globalist system the central bank system</text>
