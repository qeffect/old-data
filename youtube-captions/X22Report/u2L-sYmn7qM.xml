  <text start="128.55" dur="4.65">president and all the past presidents we</text>
  <text start="131.13" dur="3.92">see that things are definitely changing</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="5.16">right now everything that they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="135.05" dur="5.189">has to be reversed and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="6.54">are not gonna like it because they were</text>
  <text start="140.239" dur="8.051">fed false information during these past</text>
  <text start="144.9" dur="5.76">presidents terms thinking that we had</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="4.02">problems when we really didn&amp;#39;t one of</text>
  <text start="150.66" dur="4.079">them was climate change and I know a lot</text>
  <text start="152.31" dur="4.92">of people gonna argue about this and we</text>
  <text start="154.739" dur="4.771">need to realize that right now climate</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="4.92">change is not a national security threat</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="4.91">and we see right now the Trump</text>
  <text start="162.15" dur="4.86">administration has rolled back the</text>
  <text start="164.42" dur="5.11">climate change as a national security</text>
  <text start="167.01" dur="5.039">threat and this no longer applies at</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="5.04">this point he also roll back net</text>
  <text start="172.049" dur="4.831">neutrality and I see a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="174.57" dur="4.77">there arguing complaining and remember</text>
  <text start="176.88" dur="5.25">this was created by Obama it&amp;#39;s been in</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="6.84">effect since 2015 so we had the internet</text>
  <text start="182.13" dur="5.04">all those other years up into 2015 he</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="3.72">put this into place</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="4.89">with George Soros which was pushing this</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="4.29">through millions of dollars of funding</text>
  <text start="192.06" dur="4.5">now lost in all the theoretical</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="5.46">theoretical debate about how the evil</text>
  <text start="196.56" dur="6.509">ISPs will create and have a not divided</text>
  <text start="199.65" dur="4.83">Internet access is the reality that it</text>
  <text start="203.069" dur="4.021">already exists along the massive</text>
  <text start="204.48" dur="4.11">subsidies to the biggest bandwidth pigs</text>
  <text start="207.09" dur="5.25">on the planet Facebook Google Twitter</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="7.29">Netflix and the porn industry under net</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="5.13">neutrality these platforms flourished</text>
  <text start="215.88" dur="4.53">along with the rise of the mobile</text>
  <text start="217.47" dur="5.67">internet which is now arguably more</text>
  <text start="220.41" dur="4.7">important than the desktop you know the</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="5.64">one that is in your home in office</text>
  <text start="225.11" dur="5.439">Google and Apple control the on-ramps to</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="4.2">the mobile web in a way that net</text>
  <text start="230.549" dur="3.991">neutrality proponents can only dream the</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="5.539">bandwidth providers like Comcast and</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="6.36">8080 could because in truth they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="238.519" dur="4.991">consumers are ultimately the ones who</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="5.54">decide how much bandwidth costs not the</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="5.25">ISP remember an open free market and</text>
  <text start="246.44" dur="4.03">there&amp;#39;s competition when you have an</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="6.03">open and free market this is why the</text>
  <text start="250.47" dur="6.78">prices come down we decide how much we</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="4.56">can afford but the government came out</text>
  <text start="257.25" dur="4.109">and tried to convince you that these</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="4.14">eyes pea providers we&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="261.359" dur="4.741">charging a lot more money which is</text>
  <text start="263.49" dur="5.16">absolutely ridiculous because if that is</text>
  <text start="266.1" dur="4.02">true when you have real competition we</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="4.65">would see prices going up all over the</text>
  <text start="270.12" dur="6">place but when you have competition</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re competing they give you more so</text>
  <text start="276.12" dur="6.24">the prices come down net neutrality took</text>
  <text start="279.78" dur="5.82">pricing a bandwidth out of the hands of</text>
  <text start="282.36" dur="5.15">consumers it handed the profits from it</text>
  <text start="285.6" dur="5.4">to Google Facebook and all the other</text>
  <text start="287.51" dur="6.159">advertiser spamming video ads malware</text>
  <text start="291" dur="5.19">scams and everything else Google and</text>
  <text start="293.669" dur="5.401">Facebook ad revenue soared under net</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="4.62">neutrality because advertisers needs are</text>
  <text start="299.07" dur="3.99">not aligned with Google&amp;#39;s bottom line</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="4.169">but with consumers and because of that</text>
  <text start="303.06" dur="3.87">the price paid to deliver the ad</text>
  <text start="304.979" dur="4.081">Google&amp;#39;s cost of goods sold</text>
  <text start="306.93" dur="4.14">thanks to net neutrality was held</text>
  <text start="309.06" dur="4.26">artificially low in Google Facebook and</text>
  <text start="311.07" dur="3.15">the porn industry pocketed the</text>
  <text start="313.32" dur="4.32">difference</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="4.74">they grew uncontrollably in the case of</text>
  <text start="317.64" dur="2.12">Google and Facebook uncontrollably</text>
  <text start="318.96" dur="3.08">powerful</text>
  <text start="319.76" dur="4.62">that difference was never passed on to</text>
  <text start="322.04" dur="4.29">the isp who could then in turn pass it</text>
  <text start="324.38" dur="5.52">on to the consumer and that was thanks</text>
  <text start="326.33" dur="7.5">to net neutrality and we see right now</text>
  <text start="329.9" dur="7.77">net neutrality gave subsidies to the big</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="6.33">players net neutrality was a Trojan</text>
  <text start="337.67" dur="6.03">horse designed to replicate the old</text>
  <text start="340.16" dur="5.91">shout based advertising model of the</text>
  <text start="343.7" dur="5.25">good old days of print and TV</text>
  <text start="346.07" dur="5.7">advertising it was a way to control the</text>
  <text start="348.95" dur="6.27">megaphone and promote a particular point</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="5.85">of view and we see right now that George</text>
  <text start="355.22" dur="4.94">Soros and the Ford Foundation are the</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="5.7">two biggest lobbyists for net neutrality</text>
  <text start="360.16" dur="4.84">they made this up to make you believe</text>
  <text start="363.32" dur="3.81">because what they wanted it they wanted</text>
  <text start="365" dur="4.83">it to fall under the FCC regulations</text>
  <text start="367.13" dur="6.03">just like TV newspaper and the rest so</text>
  <text start="369.83" dur="6.03">they can control what was being put out</text>
  <text start="373.16" dur="5.1">there and if you noticed Google Facebook</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="4.86">they were able to ban anything they they</text>
  <text start="378.26" dur="2.97">wanted they could change their Terms of</text>
  <text start="380.72" dur="3.48">Service</text>
  <text start="381.23" dur="5.58">they could do whatever and again Google</text>
  <text start="384.2" dur="5.52">wrote a lot of the laws just like the</text>
  <text start="386.81" dur="4.35">insurance companies wrote the Affordable</text>
  <text start="389.72" dur="1.92">Care Act think about what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="391.16" dur="3.78">here</text>
  <text start="391.64" dur="5.76">the whole thing was a scam to make you</text>
  <text start="394.94" dur="4.56">believe something remember any time they</text>
  <text start="397.4" dur="4.11">pass these type of laws Affordable Care</text>
  <text start="399.5" dur="4.71">Act USA Freedom Act the Patriot it</text>
  <text start="401.51" dur="5.1">always means the opposite net neutrality</text>
  <text start="404.21" dur="4.05">never meant free and open Internet we</text>
  <text start="406.61" dur="4.05">already had a free and open Internet and</text>
  <text start="408.26" dur="3.66">they had a trick you and to think of</text>
  <text start="410.66" dur="4.17">that well if we don&amp;#39;t do this it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="411.92" dur="4.95">cost a lot of money and you know they</text>
  <text start="414.83" dur="4.65">try to make all other things come into</text>
  <text start="416.87" dur="4.38">play to make you believe that this is</text>
  <text start="419.48" dur="5.46">why this is this needs to be done this</text>
  <text start="421.25" dur="6.3">was part of their brainwashing we see</text>
  <text start="424.94" dur="4.65">right now with Trump recognizing</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="5.43">Jerusalem we see the Middle East they</text>
  <text start="429.59" dur="7.98">are banding together and we might we</text>
  <text start="432.98" dur="8.52">might be seeing a two-state type of push</text>
  <text start="437.57" dur="5.82">going on right now not by the US or any</text>
  <text start="441.5" dur="4.17">other country but by the Middle East</text>
  <text start="443.39" dur="4.26">because we saw already that Turkey is</text>
  <text start="445.67" dur="6.08">going to open up an embassy in East</text>
  <text start="447.65" dur="5.68">Jerusalem saying this is the capital of</text>
  <text start="451.75" dur="3.91">Palestine</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="7.14">and it looks like this might be pushed</text>
  <text start="455.66" dur="6.52">on the world where the US was hemming</text>
  <text start="460.47" dur="4.92">and hawing and things like that to have</text>
  <text start="462.18" dur="4.8">a two-state an agreement Russia was</text>
  <text start="465.39" dur="4.11">trying to push a two-state agreement and</text>
  <text start="466.98" dur="6.21">it looks like this might have been done</text>
  <text start="469.5" dur="7.17">to make the Middle East come together to</text>
  <text start="473.19" dur="5.1">push this plan of peace and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="476.67" dur="4.5">think this is what the Cabal really</text>
  <text start="478.29" dur="5.13">expected we see when Tillerson was out</text>
  <text start="481.17" dur="4.44">there and he came up with the idea of</text>
  <text start="483.42" dur="5.88">having talked with North Korea with no</text>
  <text start="485.61" dur="5.73">preconditions this was a feeler to put</text>
  <text start="489.3" dur="4.85">out to see what type of reaction was out</text>
  <text start="491.34" dur="7.02">there and we can see already that this</text>
  <text start="494.15" dur="8.05">was done on purpose because they wanted</text>
  <text start="498.36" dur="6.47">to they wanted to prepare the public the</text>
  <text start="502.2" dur="5.49">public opinion for peace talks with</text>
  <text start="504.83" dur="4.03">Russia with North Korea with China</text>
  <text start="507.69" dur="3.15">because the corporate media was out</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="3.99">there pushing the idea were going to war</text>
  <text start="510.84" dur="4.68">that Kim Jong moon is crazy he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="512.85" dur="5.16">fire missiles you know at the US and we</text>
  <text start="515.52" dur="4.08">already see that madness was out there</text>
  <text start="518.01" dur="3.87">saying that yeah they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="519.6" dur="3.51">technology yet and we looked at this and</text>
  <text start="521.88" dur="3.48">we saw that their missiles during</text>
  <text start="523.11" dur="5.4">reentry always exploded they never had</text>
  <text start="525.36" dur="5.01">the technology the purpose of this was</text>
  <text start="528.51" dur="4.41">to get them to a nuclear state so the</text>
  <text start="530.37" dur="5.58">Cabal wouldn&amp;#39;t go in there and you know</text>
  <text start="532.92" dur="5.19">push regime change in Iran what Obama</text>
  <text start="535.95" dur="5.73">did at the point with the p5 plus 1 deal</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="7.44">was to keep Iran from becoming a nuclear</text>
  <text start="541.68" dur="5.67">power that was the real objective to</text>
  <text start="545.55" dur="2.97">that because they realized if they can</text>
  <text start="547.35" dur="2.76">keep them from becoming a nuclear power</text>
  <text start="548.52" dur="4.47">where they created a nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="5.85">later on once they captured Syria they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="552.99" dur="6.3">be able to get into a reign remember the</text>
  <text start="555.96" dur="5.13">war was supposed to be already finished</text>
  <text start="559.29" dur="3.99">where they would capture Iran that would</text>
  <text start="561.09" dur="4.2">be the last country but the war in Syria</text>
  <text start="563.28" dur="3.99">was going on for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="565.29" dur="3.42">they needed something where they can</text>
  <text start="567.27" dur="3.63">make sure that Iran never became a</text>
  <text start="568.71" dur="3.27">nuclear power and of course what they</text>
  <text start="570.9" dur="2.37">still want to do is they still want to</text>
  <text start="571.98" dur="2.73">get into Iran this is why nikki Haley</text>
  <text start="573.27" dur="4.98">was out there trying to convince</text>
  <text start="574.71" dur="5.49">everyone that you know Iran is supplying</text>
  <text start="578.25" dur="4.53">weapons to Yemen and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="580.2" dur="4.859">right now is that the u.s. allegations</text>
  <text start="582.78" dur="6.179">of Iran missiles in Yemen are being met</text>
  <text start="585.059" dur="6.75">or with questions and skepticism than</text>
  <text start="588.959" dur="6.09">anything else right now and we see right</text>
  <text start="591.809" dur="4.68">now that she claimed to expose Iran as</text>
  <text start="595.049" dur="4.32">an illegal source of weapons used by</text>
  <text start="596.489" dur="5.1">Yemeni forces her props were alleged</text>
  <text start="599.369" dur="5.34">missile parts and we discussed this</text>
  <text start="601.589" dur="6.96">before and she tried to push the idea</text>
  <text start="604.709" dur="5.82">that Iran right now was in breach of UN</text>
  <text start="608.549" dur="4.74">resolution to 231 that restricts such</text>
  <text start="610.529" dur="4.83">transfer of missile parts and things</text>
  <text start="613.289" dur="4.23">like that to other countries and we see</text>
  <text start="615.359" dur="4.68">right now that this was all fake phony</text>
  <text start="617.519" dur="4.56">and false because she never made the</text>
  <text start="620.039" dur="5.07">connection and this is where the Cabal</text>
  <text start="622.079" dur="4.68">always screws up they never make the</text>
  <text start="625.109" dur="4.5">real connection and the proof of the</text>
  <text start="626.759" dur="5.52">connection that the country or a group</text>
  <text start="629.609" dur="6.12">or whatever they have actually supplied</text>
  <text start="632.279" dur="6.42">the equipment or the parts or the</text>
  <text start="635.729" dur="5.28">weapons or anything else or you know</text>
  <text start="638.699" dur="4.65">used terrorism or anything like that</text>
  <text start="641.009" dur="4.86">like in the case with Assad where he was</text>
  <text start="643.349" dur="9.06">gassing his own people they only show</text>
  <text start="645.869" dur="9.75">the aftermath or the missile or whatever</text>
  <text start="652.409" dur="4.83">they have and they never show the</text>
  <text start="655.619" dur="5.25">connection it&amp;#39;s almost showing the</text>
  <text start="657.239" dur="5.55">weapon on a murder case and saying this</text>
  <text start="660.869" dur="4.5">is the weapon that is the person that</text>
  <text start="662.789" dur="5.85">used it but never making the connection</text>
  <text start="665.369" dur="5.34">and linking the two this is what the</text>
  <text start="668.639" dur="3.18">propaganda has been doing for a very</text>
  <text start="670.709" dur="2.76">long time and it&amp;#39;s well on the part</text>
  <text start="671.819" dur="3.48">because the countries around the world</text>
  <text start="673.469" dur="3.99">are looking this and saying yet this</text>
  <text start="675.299" dur="4.71">makes no sense because there are many</text>
  <text start="677.459" dur="5.4">variants there are many different</text>
