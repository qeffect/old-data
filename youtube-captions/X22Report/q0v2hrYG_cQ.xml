  <text start="49.43" dur="4.53">22 report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="51.32" dur="5.52">episode 1120 and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="53.96" dur="5.07">november 6 2016 and the title the</text>
  <text start="56.84" dur="4.92">episode is the current economic collapse</text>
  <text start="59.03" dur="5.01">news brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="61.76" dur="5.46">economic collapse news now we are just</text>
  <text start="64.04" dur="5.73">days away from this election and things</text>
  <text start="67.22" dur="5.6">are really getting crazy out there and</text>
  <text start="69.77" dur="5.07">we can see that the economy is</text>
  <text start="72.82" dur="4.78">continually deteriorating it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="74.84" dur="5.49">getting better layoffs are continuing a</text>
  <text start="77.6" dur="4.26">credit Swiss we can see the latest</text>
  <text start="80.33" dur="3.99">rounds of layoffs as part of their</text>
  <text start="81.86" dur="4.32">downsizing and we can see a lot of</text>
  <text start="84.32" dur="4.62">financial institutions they&amp;#39;re cutting</text>
  <text start="86.18" dur="5.25">thousands and thousands of jobs right</text>
  <text start="88.94" dur="4.289">now and credit Swiss is saying come</text>
  <text start="91.43" dur="5.49">March they&amp;#39;re going to go even deeper</text>
  <text start="93.229" dur="6.481">and get rid of a lot more people and we</text>
  <text start="96.92" dur="5.97">can see why because what we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="99.71" dur="5.07">at is a bond bubble that is now over a</text>
  <text start="102.89" dur="3.81">hundred and ninety nine trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="104.78" dur="3.75">in size and we can see the debt-to-gdp</text>
  <text start="106.7" dur="4.71">ratio is over two hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="108.53" dur="5.009">percent and the central banks have tried</text>
  <text start="111.41" dur="3.51">pretty much everything at this time I</text>
  <text start="113.539" dur="3.33">mean really think about it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="114.92" dur="5.13">negative interest rates zero interest</text>
  <text start="116.869" dur="6.511">rates creating currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="120.05" dur="5.97">and what do they have left to do they</text>
  <text start="123.38" dur="3.87">have like three options left the</text>
  <text start="126.02" dur="5.1">government&amp;#39;s can stop spending money</text>
  <text start="127.25" dur="6.75">they can increase revenues or make the</text>
  <text start="131.12" dur="5.46">debt load easier to service now number</text>
  <text start="134" dur="5.7">one we know governments politicians</text>
  <text start="136.58" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re never going to go for cutting</text>
  <text start="139.7" dur="4.67">back on spending that&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="141.23" dur="5.58">impossible we see option number two</text>
  <text start="144.37" dur="3.91">which is increased revenues that means</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="3.03">more taxes for the people because they</text>
  <text start="148.28" dur="4.8">have to bring in more revenue to the</text>
  <text start="149.84" dur="5.67">government is that going to work most</text>
  <text start="153.08" dur="5.37">likely not option number three is to</text>
  <text start="155.51" dur="4.91">make the debt load easier to service now</text>
  <text start="158.45" dur="4.08">they can do this through inflation</text>
  <text start="160.42" dur="3.61">they&amp;#39;ve already tried it through lower</text>
  <text start="162.53" dur="4.53">interest rates negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="4.459">it has not worked and this is why the</text>
  <text start="167.06" dur="6.21">central banks have been talking about</text>
  <text start="168.489" dur="8.371">inflation and we know that once they</text>
  <text start="173.27" dur="6.21">start letting the inflation gates open</text>
  <text start="176.86" dur="3.25">they won&amp;#39;t be able to stop it there will</text>
  <text start="179.48" dur="2.52">be a run</text>
  <text start="180.11" dur="3.84">wait rain and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="182" dur="5.07">talking about for a very long time where</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="5.49">inflation is going to hit the United</text>
  <text start="187.07" dur="3.93">States is going to hit many countries</text>
  <text start="189.44" dur="5.36">which really means a devaluation of the</text>
  <text start="191" dur="6.36">dollar and we see right now that major</text>
  <text start="194.8" dur="5.08">inflation is coming this is a major</text>
  <text start="197.36" dur="5.04">signal and people really need to get</text>
  <text start="199.88" dur="4.8">prepared for what is about to happen we</text>
  <text start="202.4" dur="4.95">see out in Ukraine the United States</text>
  <text start="204.68" dur="3.84">government the central bankers the rest</text>
  <text start="207.35" dur="2.96">of the private wasn&amp;#39;t central bank</text>
  <text start="208.52" dur="4.23">countries well they&amp;#39;re not backing down</text>
  <text start="210.31" dur="4.81">they are not going to give in to the</text>
  <text start="212.75" dur="5.64">Minsk agreement we see US ambassador to</text>
  <text start="215.12" dur="5.49">Ukraine Marie jovanovic has said that</text>
  <text start="218.39" dur="4.2">Ukraine would not be urged to implement</text>
  <text start="220.61" dur="3.59">its political liabilities for seen in</text>
  <text start="222.59" dur="5.28">the Minsk agreement until Russia</text>
  <text start="224.2" dur="5.35">fulfills its liabilities and we can see</text>
  <text start="227.87" dur="4.619">right now basically what you&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="229.55" dur="5.58">is that Ukrainian government is not</text>
  <text start="232.489" dur="4.47">going to fulfill the Minsk agreements</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="4.02">which we knew from the beginning we see</text>
  <text start="236.959" dur="3.661">the United States has already set the</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="3.57">date to bring in the terminal high</text>
  <text start="240.62" dur="4.41">altitude area defense system which is</text>
  <text start="242.72" dur="5.78">the Thad system they can be bringing it</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="6.42">into South Korea within 8 to 10 months</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="4.78">we see the US Treasury Department has</text>
  <text start="251.45" dur="4.5">issued new rules banning American</text>
  <text start="253.28" dur="4.44">financial institutions from opening or</text>
  <text start="255.95" dur="4.65">maintaining accounts created on behalf</text>
  <text start="257.72" dur="5.28">of North Korean banks and basically what</text>
  <text start="260.6" dur="5.43">they just did was closed off North Korea</text>
  <text start="263" dur="6.479">access to the US financial system where</text>
  <text start="266.03" dur="5.82">they are really pushing North Korea to</text>
  <text start="269.479" dur="6.211">do something they&amp;#39;re provoking these</text>
  <text start="271.85" dur="7.74">countries we see the battle in raka has</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="7.05">begun we see the US as let loose the</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="5.91">terrorist group and they are now taking</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="4.14">over raka and we can see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.5" dur="3.15">trying to do because it&amp;#39;s all over the</text>
  <text start="286.88" dur="3.42">corporate media where they keep</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="3.12">mentioning the word that the United</text>
  <text start="290.3" dur="2.7">States government central bankers to</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="3.899">terrorist groups the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="293" dur="4.52">they&amp;#39;re taking over the capital of the</text>
  <text start="295.669" dur="4.351">Islamic state and like we said before</text>
  <text start="297.52" dur="5.2">most likely what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="300.02" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re going to create this illusion</text>
  <text start="302.72" dur="5.22">that raka is now the new capital for the</text>
  <text start="306.5" dur="4.71">moderate rebels and they&amp;#39;re just trying</text>
  <text start="307.94" dur="5.76">to continually use brainwashing to</text>
  <text start="311.21" dur="4.86">convince everyone that this is a capital</text>
  <text start="313.7" dur="3.69">that this is a capital and this is what</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re doing right now and we can see</text>
  <text start="317.39" dur="5.46">that the United States government well</text>
  <text start="319.88" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re pushing for this and their plan</text>
  <text start="322.85" dur="6.36">is to separate Syria and Iraq and create</text>
  <text start="326.75" dur="5.01">a Kurdish region and they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="4.41">this but their problem is is that the</text>
  <text start="331.76" dur="4.47">moderate rebels have a close association</text>
  <text start="333.62" dur="4.26">to al-qaeda al-nusrah and this is why</text>
  <text start="336.23" dur="4.16">they rename the group to al sham because</text>
  <text start="337.88" dur="6.93">they&amp;#39;re trying to separate this to</text>
  <text start="340.39" dur="7.03">regain the possibility that yes this is</text>
  <text start="344.81" dur="5.07">a grassroots operation where they want</text>
  <text start="347.42" dur="4.29">Assad out and if they can&amp;#39;t get Assad</text>
  <text start="349.88" dur="3.65">out they should have their own country</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="5.25">but first what they have to do is</text>
  <text start="353.53" dur="6.25">separate them from the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="356.96" dur="4.29">not physically but mentally and this is</text>
  <text start="359.78" dur="4.23">why they continually say oh we just</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="5.43">killed another al-qaeda leader we&amp;#39;ve hit</text>
  <text start="364.01" dur="4.92">an al-nusrah leader we&amp;#39;re killing those</text>
  <text start="366.68" dur="4.14">leaders and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="4.86">the groups are separating this is why</text>
  <text start="370.82" dur="6.36">they rename the group and we see right</text>
  <text start="373.79" dur="6.32">now that they are continually doing this</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="6.57">because this is their plan now of course</text>
  <text start="380.11" dur="5.35">Assad Russia most likely they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="2.88">going to go along with this we know the</text>
  <text start="385.46" dur="2.76">United States has been setting this up</text>
  <text start="386.63" dur="3.75">for a very long time this is whether to</text>
  <text start="388.22" dur="4.65">bases this is why they&amp;#39;ve raised the</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="6.12">flag in this region because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="392.87" dur="5.52">making their play now we know the</text>
  <text start="396.5" dur="4.29">elections they&amp;#39;re just days away right</text>
  <text start="398.39" dur="6">now and we can see Trump was giving a</text>
  <text start="400.79" dur="6.14">speech out in Nevada and someone yelled</text>
  <text start="404.39" dur="5.07">gun and he was rushed off the stage and</text>
  <text start="406.93" dur="4.39">we can see that there were tweets that</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="4.44">were going out there saying that there</text>
  <text start="411.32" dur="4.74">was an assassination attempt but it was</text>
  <text start="413.9" dur="6.66">from a man which his name is Austin</text>
  <text start="416.06" dur="7.05">Crites he&amp;#39;s 33 and he works on</text>
  <text start="420.56" dur="4.02">high-altitude balloons he was holding up</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="4.2">a sign that said Republicans against</text>
  <text start="424.58" dur="4.29">Trump and Christ says on his Facebook</text>
  <text start="427.31" dur="3.72">that he&amp;#39;s voting for Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="428.87" dur="4.92">calls Trump a fascist no most likely</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="6.33">this was a plant in the audience but the</text>
  <text start="433.79" dur="6.15">question is why did they do this well</text>
  <text start="437.36" dur="5.22">when you look at this it looks like this</text>
  <text start="439.94" dur="4.68">was a plant and this was a test it looks</text>
  <text start="442.58" dur="4.32">like they were testing to see how the</text>
  <text start="444.62" dur="2.88">Secret Service reacted which direction</text>
  <text start="446.9" dur="3.15">they</text>
  <text start="447.5" dur="4.91">would take Trump off the stage what they</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="6.06">would actually do how long it took</text>
  <text start="452.41" dur="6.52">because we know most likely there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.11" dur="5.12">going to be a real assassination attempt</text>
  <text start="458.93" dur="5.58">now by doing this they&amp;#39;re also showing</text>
  <text start="461.23" dur="6.82">that yes there are people out there that</text>
  <text start="464.51" dur="7.23">will try to assassinate Trump so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="6.42">already using the SIOP of assassination</text>
  <text start="471.74" dur="4.59">and right now we&amp;#39;re calling the</text>
  <text start="474.47" dur="5.22">establishment out on this because we</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="5.49">know what their plans are and we can see</text>
  <text start="479.69" dur="6.12">there&amp;#39;s a lot of elites right now that</text>
  <text start="481.82" dur="7.68">are leaving the area they&amp;#39;re leaving the</text>
  <text start="485.81" dur="7.26">country during the election period we</text>
  <text start="489.5" dur="5.25">know that John Kerry will be out of the</text>
  <text start="493.07" dur="4.26">country at this point in time there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="494.75" dur="5.52">other elites that have also made plans</text>
  <text start="497.33" dur="5.82">to be out of this country and we can see</text>
  <text start="500.27" dur="6.72">right now that this is a tense situation</text>
  <text start="503.15" dur="6.63">this election where the establishment</text>
  <text start="506.99" dur="6.66">the elites the deep state the shadow</text>
  <text start="509.78" dur="7.139">government they are prepared to do</text>
  <text start="513.65" dur="8.04">whatever they need to do to keep their</text>
  <text start="516.919" dur="6.481">power now guccifer or Gucci fur he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.69" dur="3.48">saying that he&amp;#39;s going to monitor the</text>
  <text start="523.4" dur="4.26">elections this is good referred to point</text>
  <text start="525.17" dur="4.53">o from the inside he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="527.66" dur="3.63">looking at what is really going on how</text>
  <text start="529.7" dur="4.889">does he have access to this while he is</text>
  <text start="531.29" dur="6.48">a hacker and we can see that he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="534.589" dur="4.921">to produce evidence if he finds that</text>
  <text start="537.77" dur="3.6">these elections were manipulating the</text>
  <text start="539.51" dur="3.66">most likely they will be manipulated</text>
  <text start="541.37" dur="4.26">because we know from Bev Harris with</text>
  <text start="543.17" dur="5.55">fraction magic and we know that these</text>
  <text start="545.63" dur="4.74">systems are pre-programmed ahead of time</text>
  <text start="548.72" dur="5.19">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been looking at the</text>
  <text start="550.37" dur="5.76">ballots very interestingly obama signed</text>
  <text start="553.91" dur="5.19">an executive order preparing for an</text>
  <text start="556.13" dur="6.29">epidemic before the election so right</text>
  <text start="559.1" dur="7.83">before the election he signed a</text>
  <text start="562.42" dur="6.79">worldwide epidemic executive order and</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s called advancing the global health</text>
  <text start="569.21" dur="4.32">security agenda to achieve a world safe</text>
  <text start="571.31" dur="5.399">and secure from infectious disease</text>
  <text start="573.53" dur="7.1">threats it gives the authorities extra</text>
  <text start="576.709" dur="6.651">powers to respond to biological threats</text>
  <text start="580.63" dur="4.5">as they emerged which is very</text>
  <text start="583.36" dur="3.78">interesting because we&amp;#39;re getting all of</text>
  <text start="585.13" dur="3.51">these warnings part of their siop about</text>
  <text start="587.14" dur="3.54">what is going to happen during this</text>
  <text start="588.64" dur="4.47">elections we hear the Islamic state has</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="4.92">come out and we know it&amp;#39;s not really the</text>
  <text start="593.11" dur="4.77">Islamic state we know this is all coming</text>
  <text start="595.6" dur="3.48">from the Intelligence Agency from the</text>
  <text start="597.88" dur="3.78">deep state from the shadow government</text>
  <text start="599.08" dur="4.59">and they said that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="601.66" dur="5.16">slaughter Americans on Election Day if</text>
  <text start="603.67" dur="5.64">they go out and they vote we also know</text>
  <text start="606.82" dur="3.86">that al-qaeda is saying they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="609.31" dur="5.97">be hitting New York Texas and Virginia</text>
  <text start="610.68" dur="5.8">and we have to really look at this</text>
  <text start="615.28" dur="4.29">because a lot of this is coming from</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="5.58">site intelligence groups CIA the deep</text>
  <text start="619.57" dur="4.92">state the shadow government and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="622.06" dur="6.68">out there telling the American people</text>
  <text start="624.49" dur="7.8">that this election might be halted if</text>
  <text start="628.74" dur="5.88">they don&amp;#39;t get what they want because we</text>
  <text start="632.29" dur="7.71">know the president if this does occur</text>
  <text start="634.62" dur="8.8">they will call a state of emergency they</text>
  <text start="640" dur="4.71">will postpone these elections now if you</text>
  <text start="643.42" dur="4.71">notice on the corporate media they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="644.71" dur="5.4">been keeping the elections count numbers</text>
  <text start="648.13" dur="3.9">very close one time they&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="650.11" dur="4.32">that Trump is in the lead then they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="652.03" dur="3.84">say that Clinton over took the lead but</text>
  <text start="654.43" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep it very very</text>
  <text start="655.87" dur="4.5">close now they&amp;#39;re out there tongue</text>
  <text start="657.43" dur="6.36">everyone about the Electoral College how</text>
  <text start="660.37" dur="6.93">they need to get the 270 and how close</text>
  <text start="663.79" dur="6.17">there they are and how Clinton is losing</text>
  <text start="667.3" dur="5.33">some of them this is part of their game</text>
  <text start="669.96" dur="7.03">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep these elections</text>
  <text start="672.63" dur="6.37">the election results very very close to</text>
  <text start="676.99" dur="7.38">make it look like it&amp;#39;s completely fair</text>
  <text start="679" dur="9.26">and we can see right now that the United</text>
  <text start="684.37" dur="6.96">States has already breached Russia and</text>
  <text start="688.26" dur="6.73">they&amp;#39;re saying that they opened a</text>
  <text start="691.33" dur="6.75">doorway into their infrastructure to</text>
  <text start="694.99" dur="7.41">cyber attack whenever they feel it is</text>
  <text start="698.08" dur="5.97">necessary because they&amp;#39;re saying if the</text>
  <text start="702.4" dur="5.48">numbers if they cannot control this</text>
  <text start="704.05" dur="8.16">election that people call them out on it</text>
  <text start="707.88" dur="5.86">they will use a cyber attack against</text>
  <text start="712.21" dur="2.35">Russia because what they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="713.74" dur="3.4">is that right</text>
  <text start="714.56" dur="5.31">&amp;#39;sha attacked the United States and</text>
  <text start="717.14" dur="6.09">caused the elections to go in favor of</text>
  <text start="719.87" dur="5.76">Trump because right now with Bev Harris</text>
  <text start="723.23" dur="4.56">the alternative media everyone is</text>
  <text start="725.63" dur="5.58">looking at these elections very very</text>
  <text start="727.79" dur="6.45">closely they&amp;#39;re looking for fraud we</text>
  <text start="731.21" dur="5.34">have hackers looking and we can see</text>
  <text start="734.24" dur="5.58">right now they are prepared and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="736.55" dur="6.57">making plans all over the place and we</text>
  <text start="739.82" dur="5.37">can see already that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="743.12" dur="4.17">is already out there reporting that the</text>
  <text start="745.19" dur="4.89">u.s. government hackers are ready to hit</text>
  <text start="747.29" dur="6.6">back if Russia tries to disrupt the</text>
  <text start="750.08" dur="7.35">elections this is on NBC ABC yahoo news</text>
  <text start="753.89" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s on all of them and we can see right</text>
  <text start="757.43" dur="4.64">now that Russia is demanding some type</text>
  <text start="759.89" dur="5.07">of explanation of what is going on here</text>
  <text start="762.07" dur="4.57">because the Pentagon they&amp;#39;re saying they</text>
  <text start="764.96" dur="3.99">hacked into Russia&amp;#39;s power grids</text>
  <text start="766.64" dur="4.11">telecommunications net and pretty much</text>
  <text start="768.95" dur="5.28">everything else and they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="770.75" dur="5.07">bring something down here if things</text>
  <text start="774.23" dur="3.359">don&amp;#39;t go their way now we know that</text>
  <text start="775.82" dur="5.36">Russia has nothing to do with all of</text>
  <text start="777.589" dur="8.191">this we know that they&amp;#39;re being used</text>
  <text start="781.18" dur="7.03">because they need to explain why the</text>
  <text start="785.78" dur="5.01">elections need to be halted so they have</text>
  <text start="788.21" dur="5.79">physical attacks ready to go they have</text>
  <text start="790.79" dur="6.6">cyber attacks ready to go and we can see</text>
  <text start="794" dur="5.07">that Maria Zakharova is out there saying</text>
  <text start="797.39" dur="5.9">that if the United States does not</text>
  <text start="799.07" dur="7.83">officially answer Russia we can see that</text>
  <text start="803.29" dur="7.75">cyber terrorism exists and the cyber war</text>
  <text start="806.9" dur="7.59">is often running and Russia most likely</text>
  <text start="811.04" dur="5.549">will maybe pause for a moment but if the</text>
  <text start="814.49" dur="5.4">United States does bring down their</text>
  <text start="816.589" dur="4.531">electrical grid telecommunications they</text>
  <text start="819.89" dur="3.06">will respond and the United States</text>
  <text start="821.12" dur="4.88">government central bankers they want</text>
  <text start="822.95" dur="6.42">this to happen they want this war to</text>
  <text start="826" dur="7.26">move forward they want the elections to</text>
  <text start="829.37" dur="6.48">be halted now if none of this occurs</text>
  <text start="833.26" dur="6.01">they&amp;#39;re going to keep the race very very</text>
  <text start="835.85" dur="6.48">close this way people think it&amp;#39;s a fair</text>
  <text start="839.27" dur="4.59">race it was a close race and of course</text>
  <text start="842.33" dur="4.19">they&amp;#39;re going to have their candidate</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="4.38">come out as the winner that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="846.52" dur="4.03">want doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="848.24" dur="3.45">their plans are going to work no but</text>
  <text start="850.55" dur="3.599">they&amp;#39;re going to try to make it as close</text>
  <text start="851.69" dur="5.43">as possible so even if Trump comes out</text>
  <text start="854.149" dur="5.071">as a winner most likely the election</text>
  <text start="857.12" dur="3.54">results will be contested and most</text>
  <text start="859.22" dur="4.35">likely i&amp;#39;ll have to go to the Supreme</text>
  <text start="860.66" dur="5.16">Court just like we saw with bush and</text>
  <text start="863.57" dur="5.61">gore this I think this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="865.82" dur="6.269">trying to do but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="869.18" dur="5.849">that they already have plans ready to go</text>
  <text start="872.089" dur="5.221">and people should be aware that if we do</text>
  <text start="875.029" dur="4.411">see things go alive and I say live where</text>
  <text start="877.31" dur="6.21">there is something happening in New York</text>
  <text start="879.44" dur="7.649">or Texas of Virginia or we see the</text>
  <text start="883.52" dur="5.759">introduction of a cyber attack on maybe</text>
  <text start="887.089" dur="4.321">one little town or city and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="889.279" dur="4.801">saying yes it is Russia or something</text>
  <text start="891.41" dur="6.66">like this everyone should be aware and</text>
  <text start="894.08" dur="5.79">ready to hunker down because once this</text>
  <text start="898.07" dur="5.49">goes life and they want to halt the</text>
  <text start="899.87" dur="4.95">elections they&amp;#39;re going to go full</text>
  <text start="903.56" dur="4.5">throttle they&amp;#39;re going to get the green</text>
  <text start="904.82" dur="6.99">light and in many areas you might see</text>
  <text start="908.06" dur="9.24">the electric go out you might see ATMs</text>
  <text start="911.81" dur="7.23">shut down you might see cyber war</text>
  <text start="917.3" dur="4.92">happening right in front of your eyes</text>
  <text start="919.04" dur="5.19">and when this does happen this is going</text>
  <text start="922.22" dur="4.14">to cause havoc on the street the</text>
  <text start="924.23" dur="5.25">president will have to call a state of</text>
  <text start="926.36" dur="7.88">emergency the election system will be</text>
  <text start="929.48" dur="11.21">shut down and if we get to this point</text>
  <text start="934.24" dur="9.099">this means that war is on its way now if</text>
  <text start="940.69" dur="4.63">they&amp;#39;re able to keep everything under</text>
  <text start="943.339" dur="3.99">control and they can keep the</text>
  <text start="945.32" dur="3.9">manipulation going they&amp;#39;re going to keep</text>
  <text start="947.329" dur="3.961">this race very very close they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="949.22" dur="4.92">already prepared for those individuals</text>
  <text start="951.29" dur="5.03">who are ready to riot and what I say is</text>
  <text start="954.14" dur="5.73">everyone needs to be remain peaceful</text>
  <text start="956.32" dur="6.459">everyone needs to become and protest</text>
  <text start="959.87" dur="6.839">together against the election that it</text>
  <text start="962.779" dur="6.691">was rigged and provide the proof we need</text>
  <text start="966.709" dur="5.94">to band together to show the government</text>
  <text start="969.47" dur="6.78">we are on to them because what they want</text>
  <text start="972.649" dur="6.18">is they want people to go out there with</text>
  <text start="976.25" dur="5.68">weapons they want people to go out there</text>
  <text start="978.829" dur="6.7">to smash because they know how to handle</text>
  <text start="981.93" dur="9.719">an uprising they know how to handle</text>
  <text start="985.529" dur="8.911">people who are not obeying what the</text>
  <text start="991.649" dur="6.391">government says they bring in troops</text>

  <text start="998.04" dur="4.29">the people down and they like to use</text>
  <text start="1000.529" dur="6.661">force and this is why everyone needs to</text>
