  <text start="118.479" dur="5.82">at Trump they&amp;#39;re playing their full hand</text>
  <text start="121.45" dur="4.56">because they know if they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="124.299" dur="4.68">Trump they can&amp;#39;t get him out of the way</text>
  <text start="126.01" dur="4.38">it is the end and they might even resort</text>

  <text start="130.39" dur="5.099">attempt on his life remember they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="133.72" dur="5.82">going to go down without a fight and</text>

  <text start="139.54" dur="4.08">that they&amp;#39;re playing right now is</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="6.43">completely falling apart they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="143.62" dur="7.38">know it yet take for example the story</text>
  <text start="147.34" dur="6.6">by E Jeanne Carol where she said that</text>
  <text start="151" dur="3.8">Trump attacked her in her Bergdorf</text>
  <text start="153.94" dur="4.91">Goodman</text>
  <text start="154.8" dur="6.75">in the dressing room well she was on CNN</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="5.01">with Anderson Cooper and when she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.55" dur="4.05">telling the story they kind of cut away</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="4.11">because she said you know rape is like</text>
  <text start="165.6" dur="5.94">sexy but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="167.97" dur="7.95">all of this is not that that Carol story</text>
  <text start="171.54" dur="7.44">is eerily similar to an episode of Law &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="5.04">Order from season 13 right down to the</text>
  <text start="178.98" dur="5.39">rape fantasy in Bergdorf Goodman</text>
  <text start="180.96" dur="5.4">dressing room so that story is</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="4.57">completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="4.74">and it&amp;#39;s being ripped apart and it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="346.16" dur="4.8">and indeed at the same time was</text>
  <text start="347.96" dur="4.08">unmasking individuals and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.96" dur="3.36">absolutely right and we&amp;#39;ll be getting</text>
  <text start="352.04" dur="5.85">into that in just a minute but very</text>
  <text start="354.32" dur="6.51">interestingly now Robert Mueller he will</text>
  <text start="357.89" dur="5.52">testify on July 17th and let&amp;#39;s see if</text>
  <text start="360.83" dur="5.4">that really happens let&amp;#39;s see if they</text>
  <text start="363.41" dur="4.56">follow through now according to Adam</text>
  <text start="366.23" dur="3.57">Schiff Robert Muller has agreed to</text>
  <text start="367.97" dur="3.26">deliver congressional testimony to a</text>
  <text start="369.8" dur="5.31">joint panel of the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="371.23" dur="6.1">Judiciary Committee on July 17th first</text>
  <text start="375.11" dur="6.06">to frame the narrative for the</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="5.85">appearance chairman Adam Schiff releases</text>
  <text start="381.17" dur="5.01">a letter signed by only Nadler and</text>
  <text start="383.18" dur="5.16">Schiff that threatened a subpoena the</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="5.76">subpoena letter is a prop for a</text>
  <text start="388.34" dur="5.46">pre-planned theatrical event how do we</text>
  <text start="391.94" dur="4.49">know this because Schiff and Hitler</text>
  <text start="393.8" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re the only ones that signed it</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="4.09">it&amp;#39;s an optic to set the cornerstone for</text>
  <text start="399.08" dur="4.41">a narrative that shippin aler</text>
  <text start="400.52" dur="4.74">want Muller&amp;#39;s appearance second the</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="3.81">joint committee approach is also part of</text>
  <text start="405.26" dur="4.14">the strategy with 40 members from both</text>
  <text start="407.3" dur="5.43">committees there will be intentionally</text>
  <text start="409.4" dur="4.95">only be one round of questions the size</text>
  <text start="412.73" dur="5.37">of the committee is part of the design</text>
  <text start="414.35" dur="6">to protect robert muller knowing Muller</text>
  <text start="418.1" dur="2.49">was in deep discussion which Schiff and</text>
  <text start="420.35" dur="2.4">now</text>
  <text start="420.59" dur="3.48">to coordinate the appearance the optic</text>
  <text start="422.75" dur="3">of the letter and the size of the</text>
  <text start="424.07" dur="3.99">committee are the first to immediate</text>
  <text start="425.75" dur="6.99">flares that indicate a staged</text>
  <text start="428.06" dur="7.92">performance is being set up now we know</text>
  <text start="432.74" dur="6.15">if Jim Jordan meadows and the rest get</text>
  <text start="435.98" dur="6.3">to question him this thing is going to</text>
  <text start="438.89" dur="5.07">look really bad for the Dems and for</text>
  <text start="442.28" dur="5.46">Muller because they&amp;#39;re gonna be bringing</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="6.84">up things they don&amp;#39;t want to be brought</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="6.21">up but let&amp;#39;s continue here</text>
  <text start="450.8" dur="4.85">remember couple reports ago we said</text>
  <text start="453.95" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re going to continually drip</text>
  <text start="455.65" dur="5.38">information out throw it out there and</text>
  <text start="457.91" dur="5.13">let people say wait why did why is he</text>
  <text start="461.03" dur="3.18">saying this does he have anything to</text>
  <text start="463.04" dur="2.67">back it up now of course the mainstream</text>
  <text start="464.21" dur="3.69">media is going to come out and say Oh</text>
  <text start="465.71" dur="5.22">Trump just said this or this person just</text>
  <text start="467.9" dur="6.21">said this without any type of evidence</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="5.19">or anything like that they want them to</text>
  <text start="474.11" dur="5.22">do this this is part of the set up</text>
  <text start="476.12" dur="4.71">strategy now Trump came out and he</text>
  <text start="479.33" dur="4.2">claimed that special counsel robert</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="5.49">muller illegally terminated texts</text>
  <text start="483.53" dur="5.1">between the two lovers the two pathetic</text>
  <text start="486.32" dur="5.61">lovers those two lovebirds Peter struck</text>

  <text start="493.58" dur="4.29">agency&amp;#39;s earlier Trump investigation</text>
  <text start="495.38" dur="4.43">sent thousands of text messages to each</text>
  <text start="497.87" dur="6.59">other which revealed their extreme</text>
  <text start="499.81" dur="7.72">animus for then-candidate Trump now</text>
  <text start="504.46" dur="8.88">Trump is saying that something happened</text>
  <text start="507.53" dur="9.27">here that he deleted and wiped these</text>
  <text start="513.34" dur="8.08">messages off of their phones which did</text>
  <text start="516.8" dur="8.4">happen so does this mean the messages</text>
  <text start="521.42" dur="6.96">are gone no they&amp;#39;re still there the</text>
  <text start="525.2" dur="6.27">Patriots have everything but Trump is</text>
  <text start="528.38" dur="6.24">saying that this is illegal that this is</text>
  <text start="531.47" dur="7.71">a crime and he&amp;#39;s absolutely right he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.62" dur="6.81">bringing attention to all of this we</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="4.08">have Jordan Schack tell he tweeted out</text>
  <text start="541.43" dur="4.05">the following so a Muller&amp;#39;s team wiped</text>

  <text start="1588.99" dur="5.91">a different way like an assassination</text>
  <text start="1591.17" dur="7.509">because their ammunition is pretty much</text>
