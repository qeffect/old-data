  <text start="1385.33" dur="5.49">interestingly we know that John Bolton</text>
  <text start="1387.25" dur="5.34">was fired and he was a neocon and we</text>
  <text start="1390.82" dur="5.55">know that those people in government</text>
  <text start="1392.59" dur="8.28">like Brennan the Pelosi Romney and the</text>
  <text start="1396.37" dur="8.1">rest they wanted Bolton remember he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1400.87" dur="6.6">part of the team he&amp;#39;s part of the neocon</text>
  <text start="1404.47" dur="7.44">the deep state but he&amp;#39;s not part of</text>
  <text start="1407.47" dur="7.38">Trump&amp;#39;s team and you can see that former</text>
  <text start="1411.91" dur="4.47">CIA director John Brennan he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="1414.85" dur="4.05">saying that he believes America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1416.38" dur="6.27">enemies are aware of a significant</text>
  <text start="1418.9" dur="5.85">mayhem in the Trump administration in</text>
  <text start="1422.65" dur="4.53">the national security apparatus</text>
  <text start="1424.75" dur="5.45">there&amp;#39;s no mayhem there&amp;#39;s nothing going</text>
  <text start="1427.18" dur="6.99">on there Trump has it under control</text>
  <text start="1430.2" dur="7.26">Bolton was there on purpose he was</text>
  <text start="1434.17" dur="6.33">window dressing he kept everyone busy</text>
  <text start="1437.46" dur="5.62">while Trump and the Patriots did the</text>
  <text start="1440.5" dur="5.31">real work and when Trump didn&amp;#39;t need him</text>
  <text start="1443.08" dur="6">anymore he was let go just like every</text>
  <text start="1445.81" dur="4.8">other person Brennan went on to say I</text>
  <text start="1449.08" dur="3.9">think foreign partners as well as</text>
  <text start="1450.61" dur="4.38">adversaries have already detected a</text>
  <text start="1452.98" dur="4.1">significant amount of disarray and chaos</text>
  <text start="1454.99" dur="5.34">in the national security establishment</text>
  <text start="1457.08" dur="6.46">this just is one more example of just</text>
  <text start="1460.33" dur="5.16">how serious this issue is now the timing</text>
  <text start="1463.54" dur="3.93">is very interesting and Brennan also</text>
  <text start="1465.49" dur="4.11">questioned the timing of Bolton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1467.47" dur="4.26">departure suggesting it may be a</text>
  <text start="1469.6" dur="4.83">distraction from the unflattering news</text>
  <text start="1471.73" dur="4.14">reports about Trump&amp;#39;s scrapped Camp</text>
  <text start="1474.43" dur="3.63">David meeting with the Taliban and</text>
  <text start="1475.87" dur="3.25">military stopovers at Trump&amp;#39;s Scottish</text>
  <text start="1478.06" dur="3.46">resort</text>
  <text start="1479.12" dur="5.04">now again Brennan is trying to lead</text>
  <text start="1481.52" dur="5.34">everyone down a certain path but the</text>
  <text start="1484.16" dur="4.77">reason for all of this is because Trump</text>
  <text start="1486.86" dur="4.17">has already made deals in the background</text>
  <text start="1488.93" dur="5.7">didn&amp;#39;t need Bolton by getting rid of</text>
  <text start="1491.03" dur="6.27">Bolton these deep state players they</text>
  <text start="1494.63" dur="5.82">believe that they have an opportunity</text>
  <text start="1497.3" dur="7.56">now and when I find very interesting is</text>
  <text start="1500.45" dur="7.29">that all of this is around the same time</text>
  <text start="1504.86" dur="5.55">period where Trump says he will be</text>
  <text start="1507.74" dur="4.95">hitting the Taliban harder than ever</text>
  <text start="1510.41" dur="5.37">when he&amp;#39;s talking about the Taliban is</text>
  <text start="1512.69" dur="5.4">he really talking about the Taliban that</text>
  <text start="1515.78" dur="4.32">he&amp;#39;s been negotiating peace or is he</text>
  <text start="1518.09" dur="5.46">talking about the paid mercenary Taliban</text>
  <text start="1520.1" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s mixed in with the the real</text>
  <text start="1523.55" dur="4.23">Taliban soldiers because we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="1525.32" dur="5.1">in many other countries where the deep</text>
  <text start="1527.78" dur="4.74">state there is a certain group of</text>
  <text start="1530.42" dur="4.58">individuals who are the rebels and then</text>
  <text start="1532.52" dur="6.09">they mix in al-qaeda the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1535" dur="6.16">with the rebels and in Syria they got</text>
  <text start="1538.61" dur="6.75">caught the same thing I believe happened</text>
  <text start="1541.16" dur="7.05">here who is Trump hitting he is hitting</text>
  <text start="1545.36" dur="6.449">the paid mercenary army controlled by</text>
  <text start="1548.21" dur="5.25">the intelligence organizations and we</text>
  <text start="1551.809" dur="4.891">see that the u.s. just put out a video</text>
  <text start="1553.46" dur="6.11">and this is from the oír spokesman</text>
  <text start="1556.7" dur="7.91">Colonel miles be Kagan&amp;#39;s the third</text>
  <text start="1559.57" dur="8.109">tweeted out a video of f15 f-35s</text>
  <text start="1564.61" dur="6.4">dropping bombs about 80,000 pounds of</text>
  <text start="1567.679" dur="6.181">munitions on quanis island north of</text>
  <text start="1571.01" dur="4.71">Baghdad and they are saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1573.86" dur="4.31">hitting the Islamic state even though</text>
  <text start="1575.72" dur="5.28">the Islamic state has long been defeated</text>
  <text start="1578.17" dur="7.69">why is all of this happening right now</text>
  <text start="1581" dur="8.34">this is a message to the deep state they</text>
  <text start="1585.86" dur="5.01">want the deep state to know that listen</text>
  <text start="1589.34" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;re coming after you</text>
  <text start="1590.87" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re going after you in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="1592.82" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;re going after you in Iraq because</text>
  <text start="1596" dur="5.46">they do have bases in Iraq and we need</text>
  <text start="1599.87" dur="3.9">to remember the deep state funds and</text>
  <text start="1601.46" dur="5.64">supports al Qaeda the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="1603.77" dur="6.12">most terrorist organizations Trump of</text>
  <text start="1607.1" dur="4.59">the Patriots push the deep state into</text>
  <text start="1609.89" dur="4.23">making a move</text>
  <text start="1611.69" dur="4.56">the Patriots are listening to the</text>
  <text start="1614.12" dur="5.75">chatter they&amp;#39;re observing their moves</text>
  <text start="1616.25" dur="7.44">they want to see what they&amp;#39;re up to and</text>
  <text start="1619.87" dur="6.79">what better way to do this is is to let</text>
  <text start="1623.69" dur="6.39">them do what they do best think that</text>
  <text start="1626.66" dur="8.12">they have control think that Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1630.08" dur="7.02">national security system is in chaos and</text>
  <text start="1634.78" dur="4.93">remember they know the D class is coming</text>
  <text start="1637.1" dur="5.46">remember they know what&amp;#39;s about to</text>
  <text start="1639.71" dur="4.5">happen and we know that they&amp;#39;re not just</text>
  <text start="1642.56" dur="2.28">going to sit around and just let it</text>
  <text start="1644.21" dur="2.67">happen</text>
  <text start="1644.84" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re going to create an event and</text>
  <text start="1646.88" dur="4.02">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is the timing</text>
  <text start="1649.01" dur="6.56">because Trump just signed a new</text>
  <text start="1650.9" dur="8.43">executive order to counterterrorism and</text>
  <text start="1655.57" dur="6.13">the interesting part of this is the</text>
  <text start="1659.33" dur="3.9">executive order amends a previous</text>
  <text start="1661.7" dur="3.78">directive to allow the state and</text>
  <text start="1663.23" dur="4.85">Treasury Department&amp;#39;s to directly target</text>
  <text start="1665.48" dur="6.45">leaders of terrorist groups and</text>
  <text start="1668.08" dur="6.66">associated entities without having to</text>
  <text start="1671.93" dur="6.75">tie them to specific acts</text>
  <text start="1674.74" dur="6.49">Pompeyo said more effectively and</text>
  <text start="1678.68" dur="6.11">efficiently targets individuals and</text>
  <text start="1681.23" dur="7.2">entities who participate in terrorists</text>
  <text start="1684.79" dur="6.19">training and provides new authorities to</text>
  <text start="1688.43" dur="5.43">impose sanctions on foreign financial</text>
  <text start="1690.98" dur="5.88">institutions that knowingly do business</text>
  <text start="1693.86" dur="3.66">with terrorists now think about this for</text>
  <text start="1696.86" dur="3.09">a second</text>
  <text start="1697.52" dur="5.4">we know the intelligence organizations</text>
  <text start="1699.95" dur="4.35">deal with terrorists they create the</text>
  <text start="1702.92" dur="5.96">terrorist group they fund the terrorist</text>
  <text start="1704.3" dur="7.02">group that&amp;#39;s their paid mercenary armies</text>
  <text start="1708.88" dur="8.46">think about what this executive order</text>
  <text start="1711.32" dur="9.02">says those entities that have ties to</text>
  <text start="1717.34" dur="8.22">these terrorists</text>
  <text start="1720.34" dur="9.39">that train these terrorists and since</text>
  <text start="1725.56" dur="7.29">Trump put the wheels in motion they can</text>
  <text start="1729.73" dur="5.73">find out a lot more as the deep state</text>
  <text start="1732.85" dur="6.12">the intelligence organization make new</text>
  <text start="1735.46" dur="8.34">plans and I believe all of this was done</text>
  <text start="1738.97" dur="8.43">on purpose now we need to remember that</text>
  <text start="1743.8" dur="5.04">all of this is happening at once there</text>
  <text start="1747.4" dur="3.42">are many things happening that got the</text>
  <text start="1748.84" dur="5.67">economy you got the deep state you got</text>
  <text start="1750.82" dur="5.97">the central bank you have the</text>
  <text start="1754.51" dur="4.23">intelligence organizations you have the</text>
  <text start="1756.79" dur="4.53">terrorist groups you have all of this</text>
  <text start="1758.74" dur="5.1">happening all at the same time and what</text>
  <text start="1761.32" dur="8.22">the Patriots are doing right now they</text>
  <text start="1763.84" dur="8.04">are slowly dripping out more and more</text>
  <text start="1769.54" dur="5.07">information and showing these</text>

  <text start="1794.95" dur="6.21">needed the Comey report first to back up</text>
  <text start="1797.62" dur="7.28">everything that he did with FISA this is</text>
  <text start="1801.16" dur="6.18">to inflict pain on these individuals and</text>
  <text start="1804.9" dur="4.51">I believe what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
