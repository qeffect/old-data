  <text start="120.479" dur="5.25">about the trade deal with China he</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="4.98">tweeted out the following China buys</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="4.711">much less from us than we buy from them</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="5.491">by almost five hundred billion dollars</text>

  <text start="183.1" dur="6.63">he expected a very fruitful meeting with</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="7.08">G at the upcoming g20 summit now Trump</text>
  <text start="189.73" dur="4.83">is not really worried about the trade</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="3.78">deal with China and I believe there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="6.84">plan behind this entire plan because as</text>
  <text start="196.72" dur="7.14">we know the main agenda here is to get</text>
  <text start="201.4" dur="4.26">rid of the central bank and yes the</text>
  <text start="203.86" dur="4.2">other part of the agenda is to bring</text>
  <text start="205.66" dur="4.77">back manufacturing set up bilateral</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="5.88">trade agreements get rid of all these</text>
  <text start="210.43" dur="6.48">regulations get rid of the IRS</text>
  <text start="213.94" dur="4.17">eventually and we can see that</text>
  <text start="216.91" dur="6">eventually we will head in that</text>
  <text start="218.11" dur="8.73">direction but the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="222.91" dur="7.56">are saying that Trump&amp;#39;s failure to</text>
  <text start="226.84" dur="5.7">negotiate with China is a very bad thing</text>
  <text start="230.47" dur="4.44">this is coming out of the South China</text>

  <text start="242.049" dur="7.681">supply chains in both countries</text>
  <text start="244.41" dur="8.41">well this quote by Nelson dung is stated</text>
  <text start="249.73" dur="5.789">as if shifting breaking supply chains is</text>
  <text start="252.82" dur="6.3">a flaw in the approach it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.519" dur="7.101">exactly the opposite which is true this</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="6.54">is a feature of the strategic reset a</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="7.72">specific and purposeful feature design</text>
  <text start="265.66" dur="5.94">by Trump China has no choice if they</text>
  <text start="270.34" dur="4.05">want to retain their economic model</text>
  <text start="271.6" dur="6.12">remember China&amp;#39;s economy is deep</text>
  <text start="274.39" dur="5.399">manufacturing but also narrow they are</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="6.419">dependent on raw materials customers and</text>
  <text start="279.789" dur="6.331">market access Trump announced that he</text>
  <text start="284.139" dur="4.201">has not made any decision on the next</text>
  <text start="286.12" dur="4.74">phase of the 25% tariffs on the</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="5.7">remaining 350 billion in Chinese</text>
  <text start="290.86" dur="4.98">products he doesn&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="294.04" dur="3.99">really the possibility of additional</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="4.74">tariffs we&amp;#39;ll pause any further</text>
  <text start="298.03" dur="3.87">investment and some companies not</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="4.43">currently impacted will make decisions</text>
  <text start="301.9" dur="8.13">to avoid the possibility of impact</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="8.26">Trump has walked chairman ji into the</text>
  <text start="310.03" dur="6.3">corner now Trump ng they are on a</text>
  <text start="313.27" dur="3.78">friendly basis and they like speaking</text>
  <text start="316.33" dur="2.49">with each other</text>
  <text start="317.05" dur="4.44">I believe they both think that each</text>
  <text start="318.82" dur="6">other have great ideas but you have to</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="7.08">remember G is leader of China Trump is</text>
  <text start="324.82" dur="5.67">the leader of the u.s. I do believe</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re still working together to get</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="5.52">rid of their common enemy and that is</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="4.65">the central bank system but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="336.01" dur="4.46">gonna do everything they have to in the</text>
  <text start="337.9" dur="7.05">best interest for their own country and</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="6.34">Trump he is making sure that he is doing</text>
  <text start="344.95" dur="5.97">everything in the best interest for this</text>
  <text start="346.81" dur="6.69">country now remember he flew around and</text>
  <text start="350.92" dur="5.91">he made different deals with different</text>
  <text start="353.5" dur="6.6">countries throughout Asia he did this on</text>
  <text start="356.83" dur="6.21">purpose he needed a back-up plan and we</text>
  <text start="360.1" dur="4.98">know that China they cannot sustain a</text>
  <text start="363.04" dur="6.03">long-term economic conflict with the</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="7.32">u.s. the u.s. purchases their goods from</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="6.51">China if the u.s. decides to go to South</text>
  <text start="372.4" dur="4.32">Korea Vietnam Philippines India and they</text>
  <text start="375.58" dur="2.04">say you know what we&amp;#39;re not gonna buy</text>
  <text start="376.72" dur="5.04">from China anymore</text>
  <text start="377.62" dur="8.61">what happens to China well their GDP</text>
  <text start="381.76" dur="7.98">suffers they know this right now with</text>
  <text start="386.23" dur="6.66">the Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s help we control</text>
  <text start="389.74" dur="6.24">where we&amp;#39;re going to purchase now is</text>
  <text start="392.89" dur="4.74">this going to be forever no but we also</text>
  <text start="395.98" dur="3.69">know that companies because of the</text>
  <text start="397.63" dur="4.53">tariffs and everything else they are</text>
  <text start="399.67" dur="4.14">going to maybe think twice and maybe say</text>
  <text start="402.16" dur="1.95">oh you know what I see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="403.81" dur="2.97">here</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="6.42">let&amp;#39;s move someplace else this is coming</text>
  <text start="406.78" dur="6.09">out of the LA Times and GoPro Inc will</text>
  <text start="410.53" dur="4.16">move most of its us-bound camera</text>
  <text start="412.87" dur="4.2">production out of China by summer</text>
  <text start="414.69" dur="5.08">becoming one of the first brand name</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="4.26">electronic makers to take such action to</text>
  <text start="419.77" dur="6.12">minimize the impact of the us-china</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="6.89">trade wars so what we&amp;#39;re watching right</text>
  <text start="425.89" dur="6.51">now is Trump</text>
  <text start="428.22" dur="8.56">strategically maneuvering around China</text>
  <text start="432.4" dur="8.34">to force them into doing what he wants</text>
  <text start="436.78" dur="7.05">and he has a back-up plan now this</text>
  <text start="440.74" dur="6.21">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that G and Trump are not on</text>
  <text start="443.83" dur="5.46">the same page because I believe what</text>
  <text start="446.95" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re both doing right now is that</text>
  <text start="449.29" dur="7.05">they&amp;#39;re working on a plan to bring down</text>
  <text start="453.13" dur="8.81">the central bank and to push this system</text>
  <text start="456.34" dur="9.45">to the edge very interestingly the</text>
  <text start="461.94" dur="9.57">Chinese chief negotiator vice premier</text>
  <text start="465.79" dur="9.93">Liu he was stripped of his title after</text>
  <text start="471.51" dur="6.7">negotiating with Trump now this is very</text>
  <text start="475.72" dur="6.24">interesting remember in each country</text>
  <text start="478.21" dur="6.6">there are certain individuals that are</text>
  <text start="481.96" dur="4.62">not working in the best interest of</text>
  <text start="484.81" dur="3.99">their countries there&amp;#39;s deep state</text>
  <text start="486.58" dur="4.53">operatives all over the place I mean</text>
  <text start="488.8" dur="4.92">think about the United States think</text>
  <text start="491.11" dur="4.8">about what Trump has had has had to go</text>
  <text start="493.72" dur="4.56">up against think about gee do you think</text>
  <text start="495.91" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s not others within his government</text>
  <text start="498.28" dur="4.949">that are working against him of course</text>
  <text start="500.83" dur="5.01">there are now Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="503.229" dur="5.19">something very interesting he said when</text>
  <text start="505.84" dur="5.13">the time is right we will make a deal</text>
  <text start="508.419" dur="6.151">with China my respect and friendship</text>
  <text start="510.97" dur="6.18">with President Xi is unlimited but as</text>
  <text start="514.57" dur="4.23">have I told him many times before this</text>
  <text start="517.15" dur="4.38">must be a great deal for the United</text>
  <text start="518.8" dur="6">States or it just doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="521.53" dur="5.91">we have to be allowed to make up some of</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="4.47">the tremendous ground we have lost to</text>
  <text start="527.44" dur="5.28">China on trade since the ridiculous</text>
  <text start="529.27" dur="6">one-sided formation of the WTO it will</text>
  <text start="532.72" dur="6.69">all happen and much faster than people</text>
  <text start="535.27" dur="8.19">think now think about this the</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="8.67">globalists were creating a system that</text>
  <text start="543.46" dur="6.66">they wanted Trump now is removing</text>
  <text start="548.08" dur="3.87">everything the globalists we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="550.12" dur="4.89">now remember China was being set up to</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="6.03">work in the global system Trump now is</text>
  <text start="555.01" dur="4.86">reversing this China is pushing their</text>
  <text start="557.98" dur="3.81">belt and Road system which is completely</text>
  <text start="559.87" dur="4.71">separate from the globalist system we</text>
  <text start="561.79" dur="5.82">the global system 1 and TPP China was</text>
  <text start="564.58" dur="6.06">not signing on to that and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="567.61" dur="5.13">seeing here is that GE and Trump they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.64" dur="5.79">working on something completely</text>
  <text start="572.74" dur="7.14">different and from his next tweet we</text>
  <text start="576.43" dur="4.71">start to kind of make sense of a plan</text>
  <text start="579.88" dur="4.29">within a plan</text>
  <text start="581.14" dur="5.97">he said China will be pumping money into</text>
  <text start="584.17" dur="5.82">their system and probably reducing</text>
  <text start="587.11" dur="5.16">interest rates as always in order to</text>
  <text start="589.99" dur="5.13">make up for the business they are and</text>
  <text start="592.27" dur="5.67">will be losing that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="595.12" dur="7.02">ever did a match it would be game over</text>
  <text start="597.94" dur="10.14">we win in any event China wants a deal</text>
  <text start="602.14" dur="12.09">hmm he&amp;#39;s using China as the weapon to</text>
  <text start="608.08" dur="10.53">force the Fed into lowering rates now is</text>
  <text start="614.23" dur="5.97">she going to devalue the yuan is she</text>
  <text start="618.61" dur="4.41">gonna lower the interest rate yes I</text>
  <text start="620.2" dur="6.3">believe they&amp;#39;re already doing this Trump</text>
  <text start="623.02" dur="5.31">is going to use this to his advantage do</text>
  <text start="626.5" dur="3.75">I think this was a coincidence that this</text>
  <text start="628.33" dur="4.11">happened do I think that it was a</text>
  <text start="630.25" dur="4.44">coincidence that there was no deal no I</text>
  <text start="632.44" dur="4.74">think this was completely planned out I</text>
  <text start="634.69" dur="5.85">think he wanted I&amp;#39;m talking about Trump</text>
  <text start="637.18" dur="5.43">wanted the response from China to</text>
  <text start="640.54" dur="5.34">devalue and I believe she and Trump</text>
  <text start="642.61" dur="7.05">worked on this to get the Fed to go</text>
  <text start="645.88" dur="8.19">along with the plan of cutting rates</text>
  <text start="649.66" dur="6.9">because if the Fed cuts rates it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="654.07" dur="4.77">to benefit the United States it will</text>
  <text start="656.56" dur="5.97">also benefit China because once the deal</text>
  <text start="658.84" dur="7.2">is made guess what they&amp;#39;re both going to</text>
  <text start="662.53" dur="7.62">benefit who does it hurt it hurts the</text>
  <text start="666.04" dur="7.29">central bank system so the Trump is</text>
  <text start="670.15" dur="6.45">using the central bank weapons against</text>
  <text start="673.33" dur="7.77">them he wants to push the system to the</text>
  <text start="676.6" dur="6.6">edge he wants to use the free money to</text>
  <text start="681.1" dur="5.36">rebuild the infrastructure to make</text>
  <text start="683.2" dur="8.37">America great again to make the deals</text>
  <text start="686.46" dur="8.45">around the world and to get the Fed to</text>
  <text start="691.57" dur="7.84">lower rates push stimulus</text>
  <text start="694.91" dur="8.79">and keep this going until after the 2020</text>
  <text start="699.41" dur="8.85">election because when the Fed lowers the</text>
  <text start="703.7" dur="7.35">rates when the Fed pushes stimulus what</text>
  <text start="708.26" dur="6.84">happens to the economy we know it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="711.05" dur="7.38">illusion but what happens well the</text>
  <text start="715.1" dur="6.74">economy goes into overdrive we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="718.43" dur="6.87">it before the stock market goes up</text>
  <text start="721.84" dur="6.54">interest rates go down people get into</text>
  <text start="725.3" dur="6.24">the real estate market people get into</text>
  <text start="728.38" dur="6.13">automobiles student loans credit cards</text>
  <text start="731.54" dur="5.31">all these things it makes it a little</text>
  <text start="734.51" dur="5.01">bit easier for everyday people now does</text>
  <text start="736.85" dur="5.13">it help with the savings no Trump</text>
  <text start="739.52" dur="4.17">realizes eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="741.98" dur="4.59">happen is that this system is going to</text>
  <text start="743.69" dur="4.62">self implode on itself the central bank</text>
