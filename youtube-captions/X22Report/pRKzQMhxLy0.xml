  <text start="123.89" dur="4.319">but let&amp;#39;s go into what is happening out</text>
  <text start="125.87" dur="5.25">in the UK because right now we can see</text>
  <text start="128.209" dur="4.411">there is no deal whatsoever the EU is</text>
  <text start="131.12" dur="4.29">pushing back the head of the European</text>

  <text start="148.31" dur="4.44">emerged may has claimed that her</text>
  <text start="150.62" dur="5.16">proposals were the only serious credible</text>
  <text start="152.75" dur="4.56">way to avoid a hard border in Northern</text>
  <text start="155.78" dur="3.6">Ireland she said during a press</text>

  <text start="168.769" dur="6.601">own proposals and she&amp;#39;s also saying that</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="5.94">it looks like we might we might have a</text>
  <text start="175.37" dur="5.73">hard break from the EU now we know the</text>
  <text start="178.28" dur="5.31">central bankers they do not want this to</text>
  <text start="181.1" dur="4.05">happen they&amp;#39;re gonna push back until the</text>
  <text start="183.59" dur="2.22">very end and we know the Breck&amp;#39;s is</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="2.01">supposed to happen</text>
  <text start="185.81" dur="3.15">in 29</text>
  <text start="187.16" dur="3.36">we&amp;#39;ll see if that actually happens</text>
  <text start="188.96" dur="3.93">remember the central banks have been</text>
  <text start="190.52" dur="4.32">threatening that if the UK pulls away</text>
  <text start="192.89" dur="4.29">the economy is going to crash but the</text>
  <text start="194.84" dur="4.31">banks will be ok and of course the banks</text>
  <text start="197.18" dur="5.19">are part of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="5.47">we could see that they don&amp;#39;t want any</text>
  <text start="202.37" dur="3.33">country to leave their system and</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever they possibly</text>
  <text start="205.7" dur="8.04">can to keep the UK in the EU and it will</text>
  <text start="210.08" dur="7.35">work maybe maybe not but if the UK or</text>
  <text start="213.74" dur="5.64">when the UK does remove itself from the</text>
  <text start="217.43" dur="3.72">EU other countries are gonna say you</text>
  <text start="219.38" dur="3.77">know something maybe we should follow</text>
  <text start="221.15" dur="6.42">suit and maybe we should use our</text>
  <text start="223.15" dur="6.76">national currency instead and Russia has</text>
  <text start="227.57" dur="4.2">been calling for this and I think many</text>
  <text start="229.91" dur="4.92">of the countries out there are starting</text>
  <text start="231.77" dur="5.4">to wake up and we might see many more</text>
  <text start="234.83" dur="6.27">countries follow in the footsteps of the</text>
  <text start="237.17" dur="6.63">UK here in the US we see initial jobless</text>
  <text start="241.1" dur="6.24">claims they have now plunged to the</text>
  <text start="243.8" dur="6.57">lowest point that we&amp;#39;ve seen in a very</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="6.65">very long time how low are they well</text>
  <text start="250.37" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re at the levels from 1969 and</text>
  <text start="253.99" dur="5.32">remember what happened after after that</text>
  <text start="256.88" dur="5.76">well a recession broke out and if you</text>
  <text start="259.31" dur="7.02">look back in time you can see that each</text>
  <text start="262.64" dur="6.48">time initial jobless claims reached a</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="4.65">very low point we entered a recession</text>
  <text start="269.12" dur="4.32">and we haven&amp;#39;t seen anything like this</text>
  <text start="270.98" dur="4.85">in a very long time and what this tells</text>
  <text start="273.44" dur="5.03">us is that the manipulation of</text>
  <text start="275.83" dur="4.48">unemployment manipulation of GDP</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="5.22">manipulation of pretty much everything</text>
  <text start="280.31" dur="6.69">is allowing the economy to look like</text>
  <text start="283.69" dur="6.46">it&amp;#39;s better than we&amp;#39;ve ever ever seen it</text>
  <text start="287" dur="7.17">I mean think about a word down to 1969</text>
  <text start="290.15" dur="7.32">levels and our population is much much</text>
  <text start="294.17" dur="4.47">larger and this should show you</text>
  <text start="297.47" dur="2.94">something because we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="298.64" dur="5.25">hundreds of millions of people that are</text>
  <text start="300.41" dur="5.82">completely out of work but once again</text>
  <text start="303.89" dur="3.84">with manipulating statistical</text>
  <text start="306.23" dur="4.41">information you can make the economy</text>
  <text start="307.73" dur="4.77">look any way you want the problem is the</text>
  <text start="310.64" dur="3.84">real economy continually breaks apart</text>
  <text start="312.5" dur="4.26">this is why they couldn&amp;#39;t manipulate the</text>
  <text start="314.48" dur="4.11">retail market and they had to say oh it</text>
  <text start="316.76" dur="4.62">was the weather no it&amp;#39;s Amazon no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.59" dur="5.4">online no it&amp;#39;s everything because though</text>
  <text start="321.38" dur="5.1">things like housing when that starts to</text>
  <text start="323.99" dur="5.37">break down you can&amp;#39;t explain it away</text>
  <text start="326.48" dur="5.1">with statistical manipulation yes you</text>
  <text start="329.36" dur="4.65">can manipulate certain cities but there</text>
  <text start="331.58" dur="4.74">the whole country is not twenty cities</text>
  <text start="334.01" dur="4.98">the country is made up of a lot more</text>
  <text start="336.32" dur="5.04">than that and we see and every day that</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="5.66">passes we see that home sales they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.36" dur="5.76">continually declining I mean in August</text>
  <text start="344.65" dur="3.58">the existing home sales were completely</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="4.41">unchanged they thought they were going</text>
  <text start="348.23" dur="6.41">to go up by 0.5% so there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="351.53" dur="6.81">negative 0.7% from July</text>
  <text start="354.64" dur="5.68">nothing has improved here and the Fed is</text>
  <text start="358.34" dur="4.53">continually raising rates this is all</text>
  <text start="360.32" dur="5.31">part of the plan by the way and we</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="4.17">discussed this many times before yes I</text>
  <text start="365.63" dur="3.93">know Trump is out there telling everyone</text>
  <text start="367.04" dur="4.47">the economy is great but again this is</text>
  <text start="369.56" dur="4.65">the strategy that they are using they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="371.51" dur="4.95">using all the manipulation tactics that</text>
  <text start="374.21" dur="3.99">they used in the past and they need to</text>
  <text start="376.46" dur="4.56">make the economy look like it&amp;#39;s better</text>
  <text start="378.2" dur="5.55">than ever this way they cannot be blamed</text>
  <text start="381.02" dur="4.2">it removes it from the table where oh we</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="3.24">have to blame Trump for the economy</text>
  <text start="385.22" dur="3.96">failing they can&amp;#39;t even do it right now</text>
  <text start="386.99" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible so when we</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="3.06">look at this we see the median prices</text>
  <text start="390.59" dur="5.28">they dip for the second month in a row</text>
  <text start="392.24" dur="5.4">the West saw a 5.9 percent slump month</text>
  <text start="395.87" dur="2.43">and month and existing homes in</text>
  <text start="397.64" dur="2.43">Northeast</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="4.17">well they rose about seven point six</text>
  <text start="400.07" dur="4.29">percent and again depending on what city</text>
  <text start="402.47" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;re in and where you are this is how</text>
  <text start="404.36" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re calculating these numbers but</text>
  <text start="405.89" dur="3.66">when you take a overall look of the</text>
  <text start="407.84" dur="3.84">country and in many different areas</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="4.47">outside of the case-shiller twenty</text>
  <text start="411.68" dur="4.29">cities you can see that everything is</text>
  <text start="414.02" dur="3.57">not going well and as the interest rates</text>
  <text start="415.97" dur="3.93">continually move up we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="417.59" dur="6.24">lot of people out of the market and</text>
  <text start="419.9" dur="6.63">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing we see a study</text>
  <text start="423.83" dur="4.59">from bankrate.com and they&amp;#39;re suggesting</text>
  <text start="426.53" dur="4.5">that millions of Americans are going to</text>
  <text start="428.42" dur="4.59">tap in to their equity in their homes</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="4.38">and remember the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="433.01" dur="4.89">have inflated these bubbles so people</text>
  <text start="435.41" dur="5.28">think they have money in their homes I</text>
  <text start="437.9" dur="5.64">mean this happened prior to 2008 people</text>
  <text start="440.69" dur="5.07">were using their homes like ATM machines</text>
  <text start="443.54" dur="5.19">and then when the market fell everyone</text>
  <text start="445.76" dur="6.48">was underwater so according to the</text>
  <text start="448.73" dur="5.1">survey 24 million Americans believe</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="2.79">borrowing against their homes is an</text>
  <text start="453.83" dur="3.9">appropriate option</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="5.43">for paying their monthly bills and other</text>
  <text start="457.73" dur="4.76">household expenses for most Americans</text>
  <text start="460.46" dur="5.97">the reasons for this are self-evident</text>
  <text start="462.49" dur="8.02">stagnant wages declining wages and</text>
  <text start="466.43" dur="6.74">climbing prices and excessive debt</text>
  <text start="470.51" dur="7.35">burdens which are tied to student loans</text>
  <text start="473.17" dur="7.39">credit cards and other things so people</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="5.01">are looking at their home saying okay we</text>
  <text start="480.56" dur="4.68">got all this equity the real estate</text>
  <text start="482.87" dur="5.7">market looks like it&amp;#39;s doing well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="6">take money out of the house and use it</text>
  <text start="488.57" dur="6.06">to pay some bills this is going to be</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="7.44">another disaster because what we need to</text>
  <text start="494.63" dur="7.53">understand here is that if people have</text>
  <text start="498.68" dur="6.66">to go into their homes to pay bills to</text>
  <text start="502.16" dur="7.11">pay for certain things that means the</text>
  <text start="505.34" dur="7.23">jobs they have are not that great that</text>
  <text start="509.27" dur="6.26">means their wages are not going up that</text>
  <text start="512.57" dur="5.73">means they have too much debt that means</text>
  <text start="515.53" dur="5.92">inflation is starting to hit and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="3.69">exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing and this next</text>
  <text start="521.45" dur="3.98">downturn</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="5.61">is going to surprise many many people</text>
  <text start="525.43" dur="3.99">global markets right now they&amp;#39;ve grown</text>
  <text start="527.6" dur="4.62">way too big</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="7.36">today the markets are even larger having</text>
  <text start="532.22" dur="7.77">grown 360 percent of global global GDP</text>
  <text start="536.78" dur="5.13">which is a record high over the past</text>
  <text start="539.99" dur="3.12">decade the world&amp;#39;s largest central bank</text>
  <text start="541.91" dur="3.9">in the United States Europe China and</text>
  <text start="543.11" dur="5.1">Japan they have expanded their balance</text>
  <text start="545.81" dur="4.86">sheets from less than five trillion to</text>
  <text start="548.21" dur="5.34">more than 17 trillion in an effort to</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="5.22">promote the recovery and much of that is</text>
  <text start="553.55" dur="4.26">newly printed money and it&amp;#39;s found its</text>
  <text start="555.89" dur="3.57">way into the financial markets where it</text>
  <text start="557.81" dur="4.86">is often follows the path of least</text>
  <text start="559.46" dur="5.43">regulation one of the big corporate risk</text>
  <text start="562.67" dur="5.22">is developing largely beyond regulatory</text>
  <text start="564.89" dur="5.43">oversight some United States companies</text>
  <text start="567.89" dur="5.55">that were publicly traded in 2008 have</text>
  <text start="570.32" dur="4.89">gone private all from precisely in order</text>
  <text start="573.44" dur="3.899">to avoid intensified scrutiny from</text>
  <text start="575.21" dur="4.32">regulators many of those companies were</text>
  <text start="577.339" dur="4.261">purchased by private private equity</text>
  <text start="579.53" dur="4.59">firms and deals that leave the companies</text>
  <text start="581.6" dur="4.71">saddled with huge debts right now the</text>
  <text start="584.12" dur="4.23">typical American company owned by a</text>
  <text start="586.31" dur="4.77">private equity firm has</text>
  <text start="588.35" dur="5.64">that six times higher than its annual</text>
  <text start="591.08" dur="4.89">earnings or twice a level that a public</text>
  <text start="593.99" dur="2.85">rating agency would consider high-risk</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="3.33">or junk</text>
  <text start="596.84" dur="5.04">the biggest risk outside the United</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="4.77">States are in China which has printed by</text>
  <text start="601.88" dur="5.85">far the most money and issued by far the</text>
  <text start="604.07" dur="5.87">most debt of any country since 2008 and</text>

  <text start="615.38" dur="9">emerging markets this system is right to</text>
  <text start="620.99" dur="3.93">come down it&amp;#39;s a disaster waiting to</text>
  <text start="624.38" dur="3.69">happen</text>
  <text start="624.92" dur="4.59">just like prior to 2008 people just</text>
  <text start="628.07" dur="2.37">didn&amp;#39;t know it you had to look behind</text>
  <text start="629.51" dur="2.73">the curtain</text>
  <text start="630.44" dur="5.46">you looked behind the curtain you can</text>
  <text start="632.24" dur="6.18">see all those you know securities they</text>
  <text start="635.9" dur="6.39">were complete garbage most of the people</text>
  <text start="638.42" dur="5.22">in those were in default but nobody knew</text>
  <text start="642.29" dur="6.03">about it but why cuz they were rated</text>
  <text start="643.64" dur="6.69">triple-a no one realized it and this is</text>
  <text start="648.32" dur="4.32">the problem right now and this is why</text>
  <text start="650.33" dur="4.35">Trump&amp;#39;s plan in the Patriots plan is to</text>
  <text start="652.64" dur="4.5">build these statistical numbers up like</text>
  <text start="654.68" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;ve done in the past to heights that</text>
  <text start="657.14" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before to make it look</text>
  <text start="659.69" dur="7.05">like the economy is fantastic this</text>
  <text start="663.2" dur="5.73">removes the ability for the deep state</text>
  <text start="666.74" dur="3.3">the central bankers to blame the crash</text>
  <text start="668.93" dur="3.24">on Trump</text>
  <text start="670.04" dur="4.83">he&amp;#39;s also with the help of many others</text>
