  <text start="81.1" dur="4.049">well it looks like it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="83.08" dur="4.94">difficult to do this I think we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="85.149" dur="6">to need to do this in a huge clean sweep</text>
  <text start="88.02" dur="5.379">maybe after the economy collapses and</text>
  <text start="91.149" dur="4.741">we&amp;#39;re rebuilding but at this point when</text>
  <text start="93.399" dur="4.92">we look at what is going on here it is</text>
  <text start="95.89" dur="5.009">going to be very difficult to drain the</text>

  <text start="151.84" dur="4.8">were the top performers the financial</text>
  <text start="154.45" dur="5.52">institutions they gave the most who was</text>
  <text start="156.64" dur="5.7">number one was a Goldman Sachs was it</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="6.299">Wells Fargo was it</text>
  <text start="162.34" dur="10.83">Bank of America no it was the National</text>
  <text start="166.269" dur="10.89">Association of Realtors nor unbelievable</text>
  <text start="173.17" dur="6.38">what we&amp;#39;re seeing today is a huge bubble</text>
  <text start="177.159" dur="5.821">in the real estate market and they were</text>
  <text start="179.55" dur="5.89">the number one very interesting</text>
  <text start="182.98" dur="4.17">because they were trying to get the</text>
  <text start="185.44" dur="6.69">government to inflate the housing market</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="7.589">in all different ways by dominating the</text>
  <text start="192.13" dur="4.55">Morgana&amp;#39;s industry including guarantees</text>
  <text start="194.739" dur="5.671">and mortgage-backed securities</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="6.279">subsidizing mortgage rates and the</text>

  <text start="241.44" dur="8.04">Kevin McCarthy three point three million</text>
  <text start="245.17" dur="7.74">Patrick Murphy two point two million</text>
  <text start="249.48" dur="6.61">these individuals are bought and paid</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="5.699">for and it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult</text>
  <text start="256.09" dur="6.63">to drain the swamp we need a clean sweep</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="7.651">and we need a law that says these</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="7.73">individuals cannot take any funds from</text>
  <text start="266.26" dur="6.659">any corporation from any lobbyist group</text>
  <text start="270.45" dur="6.82">now you can see how they become very</text>
  <text start="272.919" dur="9.991">wealthy while they&amp;#39;re spending their</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="8.85">time in public office now looking at the</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="6.84">new health care which is very similar to</text>
  <text start="286.12" dur="5.76">Obamacare and we can see right now this</text>
  <text start="289.75" dur="4.02">is one area where I do not agree with</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="2.94">Trump I do not agree with this</text>
  <text start="293.77" dur="3.72">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="6.78">and neither does Rand Paul he broke it</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="6.33">down and he&amp;#39;s saying that is that</text>
  <text start="301.6" dur="5.73">there&amp;#39;s still subsidies for people to</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="5.52">buy insurance in the Paul Ryan bill they</text>
  <text start="307.33" dur="5.55">keep the subsidies they just call them</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="6.81">refundable tax credits and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.88" dur="7.08">seeing is that</text>
  <text start="316.15" dur="5.64">the insurance is actually going to get</text>
  <text start="319.96" dur="5.88">more expensive than the subsidies we</text>
  <text start="321.79" dur="5.97">have under Obamacare this isn&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="325.84" dur="5.07">getting your own money back this is you</text>
  <text start="327.76" dur="4.74">getting somebody else&amp;#39;s money so for</text>
  <text start="330.91" dur="3.45">example like a family that makes thirty</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="4.08">thousand a year could actually get</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="4.86">fourteen thousand dollars that they</text>
  <text start="336.58" dur="4.98">didn&amp;#39;t pay let&amp;#39;s say they paid zero in</text>
  <text start="339.22" dur="5.22">income tax they could get fourteen</text>
  <text start="341.56" dur="6.09">thousand back one we don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="344.44" dur="5.82">money it&amp;#39;s a new entitlement program and</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="3.989">two if you get fourteen thousand back do</text>
  <text start="350.26" dur="3.18">you think the insurance company is ever</text>
  <text start="351.639" dur="6.361">going to sell insurance for less than</text>
  <text start="353.44" dur="6.57">fourteen thousand so that doesn&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="358" dur="4.97">insurance rates to fall and it sets up a</text>
  <text start="360.01" dur="6.029">new entitlement the second thing that</text>
  <text start="362.97" dur="5.65">Paul Ryan&amp;#39;s Obamacare light that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="366.039" dur="6.091">they&amp;#39;re calling it what it does is they</text>
  <text start="368.62" dur="5.88">keep the Obamacare taxes all of them for</text>
  <text start="372.13" dur="4.19">a year and then after a year they keep</text>
  <text start="374.5" dur="5.37">the Cadillac tax forever</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="4.18">that&amp;#39;s the tax on if you have really</text>
  <text start="379.87" dur="5.31">good insurance</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="7.169">the third thing they do is they keep the</text>
  <text start="385.18" dur="4.109">individual mandate it seems like every</text>
  <text start="387.669" dur="4.021">Republican says they were against the</text>
  <text start="389.289" dur="3.81">individual mandate that&amp;#39;s if you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="5.25">buy insurance you had to pay a penalty</text>
  <text start="393.099" dur="6.69">to the government or attacks now Paul</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="5.039">Ryan&amp;#39;s plan just changes the wording</text>
  <text start="399.789" dur="5.431">around and changes who you actually have</text>
  <text start="401.979" dur="5.37">to pay and if you have to pay a penalty</text>
  <text start="405.22" dur="4.199">or tax you&amp;#39;re gonna have to pay to the</text>
  <text start="407.349" dur="4.29">insurance company so if you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="409.419" dur="7.921">their product you have to pay them</text>
  <text start="411.639" dur="8.101">anyhow now that&amp;#39;s still a mandate that</text>
  <text start="417.34" dur="5.609">isn&amp;#39;t consistent with those of us who</text>
  <text start="419.74" dur="9.06">want less government involvement and if</text>
  <text start="422.949" dur="8.571">this health care package is so great why</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="6">do you need to force people into it</text>
  <text start="431.52" dur="7.63">because the insurance companies cannot</text>
  <text start="434.8" dur="7.41">operate any other way they need everyone</text>
  <text start="439.15" dur="5.49">in nothing&amp;#39;s changed the Republican the</text>
  <text start="442.21" dur="4.949">Democrat Party it&amp;#39;s all the same they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.64" dur="5.34">all playing the same exact game there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.159" dur="8.751">no difference whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="449.98" dur="8.91">it&amp;#39;s completely obvious this health plan</text>
  <text start="455.91" dur="7.81">cannot pass whatsoever it is not a</text>
  <text start="458.89" dur="10.89">benefit to the people now we continually</text>
  <text start="463.72" dur="9.21">hear how Trump sessions parts of trumps</text>
  <text start="469.78" dur="5.79">administration where they had contact</text>
  <text start="472.93" dur="5.28">with Russia and how they were dealing</text>
  <text start="475.57" dur="4.23">with Russia and we can see the establish</text>
  <text start="478.21" dur="2.79">when the deep state they were trying to</text>
  <text start="479.8" dur="3.81">make all these connections that just</text>
  <text start="481" dur="4.38">didn&amp;#39;t exist but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="483.61" dur="5.34">about all of this</text>
  <text start="485.38" dur="6.6">Russia&amp;#39;s largest Bank surburban has</text>
  <text start="488.95" dur="6.51">confirmed that it hired the consultancy</text>
  <text start="491.98" dur="6.24">of Tony Podesta the elder brother of</text>
  <text start="495.46" dur="5.88">John Podesta who chaired Hillary</text>
  <text start="498.22" dur="4.77">Clinton&amp;#39;s presidential campaign for</text>
  <text start="501.34" dur="3.81">lobbying its interest in the United</text>
  <text start="502.99" dur="5.45">States and proactively seeking the</text>
  <text start="505.15" dur="6.03">removal of various Obama era sanctions</text>
  <text start="508.44" dur="5.11">so Podesta founder and chairman of the</text>
  <text start="511.18" dur="6.32">Podesta group is listed as a key</text>
  <text start="513.55" dur="8.07">lobbyist on behalf of suburban I mean</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="7.24">Russia this bank paid his firm twenty</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="4.71">four million dollars in fees in 2016 so</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="3.81">when we start to look around and we</text>
  <text start="526.33" dur="4.77">start to see what is going on here we</text>
  <text start="528.55" dur="4.62">see that Trump at this point there is</text>
  <text start="531.1" dur="3.99">absolutely no proof whatsoever and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="533.17" dur="4.58">seeing on the other side they were</text>
  <text start="535.09" dur="5.66">dealing with Russia one way or another</text>
  <text start="537.75" dur="6.09">where there was certain connections</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="8.86">which I find very interesting</text>
  <text start="543.84" dur="9.67">now Trump&amp;#39;s EPA chief Scott Pruett says</text>
  <text start="549.61" dur="6.45">that carbon dioxide is not a primary</text>
  <text start="553.51" dur="4.52">contributor to global warming he also</text>
  <text start="556.06" dur="4.59">called the Paris agreement an</text>
  <text start="558.03" dur="5.23">international Accord aimed at mitigating</text>
  <text start="560.65" dur="4.35">the impacts of climate change he says</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="3.21">it&amp;#39;s a bad deal he said it puts the</text>
  <text start="565" dur="3.24">United States on a different playing</text>
  <text start="566.47" dur="4.65">field than developing countries like</text>
  <text start="568.24" dur="4.89">China and India because I happen to</text>
  <text start="571.12" dur="4.83">think that Paris Accord the parrot Paris</text>
  <text start="573.13" dur="4.92">treaty or the Paris agreement if you</text>
  <text start="575.95" dur="4.23">will should have been treated as a</text>
  <text start="578.05" dur="5.4">treaty should have gone through the</text>
  <text start="580.18" dur="6.57">Senate confirmation but it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="7.8">it was completely bypassed and that was</text>
  <text start="586.75" dur="7.64">done on purpose we see at this point</text>
  <text start="591.25" dur="6.29">even with no border wall just by</text>
  <text start="594.39" dur="5.74">implementing different executive orders</text>
  <text start="597.54" dur="6.22">telling the Border Patrol&amp;#39;s to do their</text>
  <text start="600.13" dur="9.15">job illegal border crossings are down by</text>
  <text start="603.76" dur="6.99">40% already in the first month so US</text>
  <text start="609.28" dur="2.91">Customs and Border Patrol reported that</text>
  <text start="610.75" dur="6.71">a number of illegal border crossings</text>
  <text start="612.19" dur="8.82">dropped from 30 1578 to 18,000 762 and</text>
  <text start="617.46" dur="6.52">that&amp;#39;s just by letting them do their job</text>
  <text start="621.01" dur="5.88">now if you give them more surveillance</text>
  <text start="623.98" dur="4.83">equipment add more Border Patrol agents</text>
  <text start="626.89" dur="3.99">I don&amp;#39;t know if we need to spend all</text>
  <text start="628.81" dur="4.53">this money on a wall I think we can</text>
  <text start="630.88" dur="7.26">protect the borders by just doing the</text>
  <text start="633.34" dur="8.67">job I mean it just by doing this he cut</text>
  <text start="638.14" dur="9.27">this almost in half already so he can be</text>
  <text start="642.01" dur="8.7">done now kim.com is out there he is</text>
  <text start="647.41" dur="4.62">saying that Trump is in danger and we</text>
  <text start="650.71" dur="3.89">know that Robert Steele was out there</text>
  <text start="652.03" dur="5.22">saying that yes Trump is in danger I</text>
  <text start="654.6" dur="4.18">mean Trump hung up the Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="657.25" dur="3.09">portrait which tells you that the</text>
  <text start="658.78" dur="3.78">central bankers are probably gonna take</text>
  <text start="660.34" dur="5.88">a pot shot at him just like they did</text>
  <text start="662.56" dur="5.19">Andrew Jackson the wise hat the White</text>
  <text start="666.22" dur="4.53">House leaks he says are coming from a</text>
  <text start="667.75" dur="5.58">rogue group within the CIA they want to</text>
  <text start="670.75" dur="5.97">stop the Trump presidency this is not</text>
  <text start="673.33" dur="5.82">speculation the rogue group of Obama</text>
  <text start="676.72" dur="5.1">loyalists at CIA used powerful cyber</text>
  <text start="679.15" dur="6.12">warfare tools illegally despite on Trump</text>
  <text start="681.82" dur="4.77">and fabricated Russian narrative which</text>
  <text start="685.27" dur="3.6">we know this is true because the CIA</text>
  <text start="686.59" dur="3.72">leaks and all of that was in there we</text>
  <text start="688.87" dur="2.28">know that they were spying on the people</text>
  <text start="690.31" dur="3.3">they were spying on pretty much</text>
  <text start="691.15" dur="4.83">everybody they were compiling binaries</text>
  <text start="693.61" dur="4.44">and creating malware leaving breadcrumbs</text>
  <text start="695.98" dur="3.66">so everyone would think it&amp;#39;s a different</text>
  <text start="698.05" dur="4.74">country that is actually doing the</text>
  <text start="699.64" dur="6.78">cyberattack and something else was in</text>
  <text start="702.79" dur="6.15">the documentation buried among thousands</text>
  <text start="706.42" dur="5.07">of covert CIA documents which was</text>
  <text start="708.94" dur="6.18">released by WikiLeaks there were a list</text>
  <text start="711.49" dur="5.94">of Japanese emojis used without any</text>
  <text start="715.12" dur="6">explanation by spy agency</text>
  <text start="717.43" dur="6.87">snoops begging the question is this a</text>
  <text start="721.12" dur="6.33">secret code they used now many of the</text>
  <text start="724.3" dur="5.82">symbols in the japanese-style faces show</text>
  <text start="727.45" dur="5.88">popular emoticons created by the</text>
  <text start="730.12" dur="4.89">keyboard strokes and you can see them on</text>
  <text start="733.33" dur="4.44">the xfinty report calm or fear on</text>
  <text start="735.01" dur="5.13">YouTube you can see them there now again</text>
  <text start="737.77" dur="4.2">we don&amp;#39;t know what they exactly mean but</text>
  <text start="740.14" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s very interesting that they included</text>
  <text start="741.97" dur="6.09">them so it looks like this must have</text>
  <text start="743.86" dur="6.51">been some type of signal when maybe they</text>
  <text start="748.06" dur="4.76">were talking to each other or something</text>
  <text start="750.37" dur="7.29">else we just don&amp;#39;t know at this point</text>
  <text start="752.82" dur="8.2">now the CIA issued a statement on the</text>

  <text start="765.88" dur="3.45">WikiLeaks has dubbed the biggest</text>
  <text start="767.53" dur="4.56">publication of confidential CIA material</text>
  <text start="769.33" dur="5.4">in history and they&amp;#39;ve only released</text>
  <text start="772.09" dur="5.25">like one percent already and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="774.73" dur="8.19">there&amp;#39;s a lot more in there on what the</text>
  <text start="777.34" dur="8.49">CIA has been doing now the CIA does not</text>
  <text start="782.92" dur="5.28">deny that the documents are authentic it</text>
  <text start="785.83" dur="5.04">defends itself by saying that its</text>
  <text start="788.2" dur="5.55">mission is to aggressively collect</text>
  <text start="790.87" dur="6.03">foreign intelligence overseas to protect</text>
  <text start="793.75" dur="7.08">America from terrace well they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="796.9" dur="8.67">tracked down one terrorist yet and why</text>
  <text start="800.83" dur="6.87">do they have to spy on all Americans why</text>
  <text start="805.57" dur="5.73">do they have to take every single device</text>
  <text start="807.7" dur="6.18">and violate our rights they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="811.3" dur="5.13">looking for terrorists they were never</text>
  <text start="813.88" dur="5.07">looking for terrorists I mean they have</text>
  <text start="816.43" dur="4.65">all this spying apparatus they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="818.95" dur="5.07">stop the Boston bombing we know that was</text>
  <text start="821.08" dur="6.18">a false flag they can&amp;#39;t they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="824.02" dur="6.96">stop the San Bernardino shooting they</text>
  <text start="827.26" dur="6.69">couldn&amp;#39;t stop anything because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="830.98" dur="7.73">not what they were really doing this is</text>
  <text start="833.95" dur="7.17">a cover story this is their excuse and</text>
  <text start="838.71" dur="4.21">of course they said well the CIA is</text>
  <text start="841.12" dur="3.33">legally prohibited from conducting</text>
  <text start="842.92" dur="5.13">electronic surveillance</text>
  <text start="844.45" dur="5.94">you mean like the NSA when James clapper</text>
  <text start="848.05" dur="3.03">was in front of Congress and he was</text>
  <text start="850.39" dur="3.75">asked</text>
  <text start="851.08" dur="4.98">Point Blank does the NSA spy on the</text>
  <text start="854.14" dur="3.81">American people and he lied to the</text>
  <text start="856.06" dur="3.81">people and said absolutely not we do not</text>
  <text start="857.95" dur="4.62">spy on the American people and then</text>
  <text start="859.87" dur="5.64">later he says okay I admit it we spy on</text>
  <text start="862.57" dur="6.54">the American people so why would we</text>
  <text start="865.51" dur="6.21">believe the CIA at this point we know</text>
  <text start="869.11" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re lying we know what the</text>
  <text start="871.72" dur="6.059">documentation says that they&amp;#39;re spying</text>
  <text start="874.45" dur="7.77">on every single person black mount</text>
  <text start="877.779" dur="8.37">blackmailing who they want killing who</text>
  <text start="882.22" dur="5.52">they need to kill and I&amp;#39;m sure as more</text>
  <text start="886.149" dur="3.541">of the documentation is released and</text>
  <text start="887.74" dur="7.89">more people go through it we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="889.69" dur="9.54">find a lot more out there now we see</text>
  <text start="895.63" dur="7.579">that there was this retired Russian</text>
  <text start="899.23" dur="7.14">colonel and he&amp;#39;s warning trump that</text>
  <text start="903.209" dur="7.69">Russia is seeding the u.s. shoreline</text>
  <text start="906.37" dur="10.17">with nuclear Mol missiles now this is</text>
  <text start="910.899" dur="8.761">completely BS they&amp;#39;re not lining the</text>
  <text start="916.54" dur="7.41">shores of the United States this is to</text>
  <text start="919.66" dur="6.63">scare everyone and to keep that scary</text>
  <text start="923.95" dur="3.78">enemy alive just like they&amp;#39;re doing with</text>
  <text start="926.29" dur="5.73">North Korea like they&amp;#39;re doing with</text>
  <text start="927.73" dur="6.09">China and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="932.02" dur="5.49">everyone that this is what Russia is</text>
  <text start="933.82" dur="8.94">doing right now which we know is</text>
  <text start="937.51" dur="8.25">completely fake phony and false we see</text>
  <text start="942.76" dur="5.94">the u.s. is stepping up the commando</text>
  <text start="945.76" dur="4.5">deployment in Yemen the Pentagon has</text>
  <text start="948.7" dur="4.379">quietly ordered fresh deployments of</text>
  <text start="950.26" dur="6.09">special operation troops into this area</text>
  <text start="953.079" dur="5.491">and this move signals that the u.s. well</text>
  <text start="956.35" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re becoming more aggressive in this</text>
  <text start="958.57" dur="8.1">area because the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="960.82" dur="7.44">bankers they want this area back and we</text>
  <text start="966.67" dur="3.8">can see right now more and more troops</text>
  <text start="968.26" dur="5.519">are moving into the Middle East</text>
  <text start="970.47" dur="7.54">it looks like US is preparing to send a</text>
  <text start="973.779" dur="8.391">thousand new forces into Kuwait to be</text>
  <text start="978.01" dur="7.82">deployed to Syria and Iraq</text>
  <text start="982.17" dur="6.75">now the question is were they invited</text>
  <text start="985.83" dur="5.73">into Syria because we&amp;#39;re really building</text>
  <text start="988.92" dur="6.54">up a huge force in Syria at this point</text>
  <text start="991.56" dur="5.82">and right now the Syrian government is</text>
  <text start="995.46" dur="4.83">not working with the United States</text>
  <text start="997.38" dur="5.67">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1000.29" dur="6.03">working with Russia at all they were not</text>
  <text start="1003.05" dur="6.57">invited into Syria so on all accounts</text>
  <text start="1006.32" dur="7.41">this is an invasion because the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1009.62" dur="5.97">government did not invite them in and we</text>
  <text start="1013.73" dur="5.16">can see from the Central Command chief</text>
  <text start="1015.59" dur="6.63">General Joseph Votel when he was in</text>
  <text start="1018.89" dur="7.59">front of Congress he stated the</text>
  <text start="1022.22" dur="8.16">following we were not invited in the</text>
  <text start="1026.48" dur="6.57">u.s. sent Marines into Syria without the</text>
  <text start="1030.38" dur="6.449">request or without the permission of the</text>
  <text start="1033.05" dur="6.24">Syrian government we are looking at that</text>
  <text start="1036.829" dur="6.271">as an extension of the authority to</text>
  <text start="1039.29" dur="6.69">operate from Iraq what does that have to</text>
  <text start="1043.1" dur="7.8">do with Syria I mean they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="1045.98" dur="7.44">2001 go after al-qaeda law I mean this</text>
  <text start="1050.9" dur="4.86">is a separate country and they do not</text>
  <text start="1053.42" dur="4.35">have the permission to be in Syria</text>
  <text start="1055.76" dur="5.48">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="1057.77" dur="7.2">bankers right now are invading a country</text>
  <text start="1061.24" dur="7.72">they&amp;#39;re not working with Russia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1064.97" dur="7.47">not working with Syria this can really</text>
  <text start="1068.96" dur="5.43">blow up in their faces now is Russia</text>
  <text start="1072.44" dur="4.65">going to do anything they know they know</text>
  <text start="1074.39" dur="5.46">that this would blow up and it would</text>
  <text start="1077.09" dur="5.7">start World War 3 right off the bat but</text>
  <text start="1079.85" dur="5.25">again when we look at this this is</text>
  <text start="1082.79" dur="5.13">completely against international law</text>
  <text start="1085.1" dur="5.4">because if this happened here in the</text>
  <text start="1087.92" dur="5.82">United States where Syria was sending</text>
  <text start="1090.5" dur="5.46">troops in to fight terrorism well guess</text>
  <text start="1093.74" dur="7.35">what that would be looked at as an</text>
  <text start="1095.96" dur="8.46">invasion now Russia is out there Kremlin</text>
  <text start="1101.09" dur="7.41">spokesman Dmitry Peskov and he rejected</text>
  <text start="1104.42" dur="8.28">the information that Moscow would allow</text>
  <text start="1108.5" dur="7.679">Israel to fight Hezbollah in Syrian</text>
  <text start="1112.7" dur="5.24">airspace and Russia saying well</text>
  <text start="1116.179" dur="4.411">this has nothing to do with reality</text>
  <text start="1117.94" dur="4.9">we&amp;#39;ve never discussed this we are not</text>
  <text start="1120.59" dur="5.969">giving them permission to enter Syria</text>
  <text start="1122.84" dur="7.1">and we can see right now it it looks</text>
  <text start="1126.559" dur="6.301">like Israel might try something in Syria</text>
  <text start="1129.94" dur="5.5">now other times Israel has flown in</text>
  <text start="1132.86" dur="4.199">there they have fired missiles but we</text>
  <text start="1135.44" dur="4.559">know right now that Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="1137.059" dur="6.5">they have the s-300 the s400 missile</text>
  <text start="1139.999" dur="6.12">system implemented inside of Syria and I</text>
  <text start="1143.559" dur="5.62">mean if it&amp;#39;s operational at the point in</text>
  <text start="1146.119" dur="6.03">time when any other plane comes into the</text>
  <text start="1149.179" dur="4.38">airspace they could be shot down now is</text>
  <text start="1152.149" dur="4.14">this something they they might want</text>
  <text start="1153.559" dur="5.97">maybe maybe to start some type of</text>
  <text start="1156.289" dur="5.34">international war we don&amp;#39;t know but what</text>
  <text start="1159.529" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that things</text>
  <text start="1161.629" dur="6.3">are really heating up in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1164.119" dur="6.66">and we know that the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="1167.929" dur="4.891">deep state they are pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="1170.779" dur="7.22">to remove Assad that has not gone away</text>
  <text start="1172.82" dur="9.449">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is chaos</text>
  <text start="1177.999" dur="9.12">has started we have the CIA leaks we</text>
  <text start="1182.269" dur="9.23">have the troops entering the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1187.119" dur="6.43">we have the North Korea issue with</text>
  <text start="1191.499" dur="4.091">nuclear weapons with the THAAD missile</text>
  <text start="1193.549" dur="5.49">system being brought into South Korea</text>
  <text start="1195.59" dur="6.659">and tensions being built up there we</text>
  <text start="1199.039" dur="5.551">have the debt ceiling coming up on March</text>
  <text start="1202.249" dur="6.75">15th I mean everything is chaotic at</text>
  <text start="1204.59" dur="7.289">this point and as we move forward</text>
  <text start="1208.999" dur="8.16">through the spring as we move forward</text>
  <text start="1211.879" dur="8.9">into the summer and if this debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="1217.159" dur="6.75">is not raised we are going to see a</text>
  <text start="1220.779" dur="7.331">system that will completely break down</text>
  <text start="1223.909" dur="6.48">and as the system breaks down the system</text>
  <text start="1228.11" dur="5.699">is going to crash and as the system</text>
  <text start="1230.389" dur="8.28">crashes well it&amp;#39;s going to be horrific</text>
  <text start="1233.809" dur="10.021">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="1238.669" dur="8.64">when the system comes down well currency</text>
  <text start="1243.83" dur="4.68">the credit markets everything that we</text>

  <text start="1252.89" dur="4.71">situation and we look at what will</text>
  <text start="1254.99" dur="6">change we see well all the programs from</text>

  <text start="1265.429" dur="6.301">work as the government moves forward</text>

  <text start="1271.73" dur="6.06">cash they have well government is going</text>
  <text start="1275.299" dur="4.051">to freeze up which means the</text>
