  <text start="292.11" dur="7.92">what&amp;#39;s happening with us manufacturing</text>
  <text start="296.54" dur="7.21">it kind of relates to what happened in</text>
  <text start="300.03" dur="7.65">2009 very similar we&amp;#39;re seeing this same</text>
  <text start="303.75" dur="6.87">thing occur now than when we did in 2008</text>
  <text start="307.68" dur="4.62">going into 2009 and this explains why</text>
  <text start="310.62" dur="6.21">the Baltic Dry Index is continually</text>
  <text start="312.3" dur="7.62">falling it&amp;#39;s down to 888 points now</text>

  <text start="319.92" dur="6.96">income they&amp;#39;re not going out purchasing</text>
  <text start="323.73" dur="5.34">like crazy they&amp;#39;re not purchasing no</text>
  <text start="326.88" dur="4.17">orders are coming in if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="329.07" dur="4.83">ordering factories don&amp;#39;t need the raw</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="6.93">material to produce the products and</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="11.12">this is what we are seeing and we are</text>
  <text start="337.98" dur="10.74">headed into a holiday season period and</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="7.54">we&amp;#39;re seeing manufacturing fall and we</text>
  <text start="348.72" dur="8.13">see more and more layoffs continually</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="6.84">having walmart has just told their</text>
  <text start="356.85" dur="5.1">department directors to cancel the</text>
  <text start="359.4" dur="5.37">travel plans and make sure that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.95" dur="4.65">in the office on Friday why because</text>
  <text start="364.77" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re going to begin layoffs in the</text>
  <text start="366.6" dur="7.59">headquarters we see a lot of competition</text>
  <text start="371.4" dur="4.98">out if it were in a recovery like the</text>
  <text start="374.19" dur="6.48">government is telling us and everything</text>
  <text start="376.38" dur="7.95">is fine we shouldn&amp;#39;t see all these</text>
  <text start="380.67" dur="8.51">layoffs I mean would you believe the US</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="7.38">government the central bankers in 2008</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="5.74">when you saw all the layoffs people</text>
  <text start="391.71" dur="5.67">walking outside with their boxes layoffs</text>
  <text start="394.92" dur="3.81">from all the companies and if when you</text>
  <text start="397.38" dur="3.12">saw that and they told you that</text>
  <text start="398.73" dur="7.1">everything was fine did you believe them</text>
  <text start="400.5" dur="8.16">then well why would we believe them now</text>
  <text start="405.83" dur="6.22">it makes no sense because aren&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="408.66" dur="7.11">seeing the same thing and something</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="5.85">really doesn&amp;#39;t compute here because the</text>
  <text start="415.77" dur="6.11">Department of Labor is telling us that</text>
  <text start="417.9" dur="7.29">unemployment is fine there&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="4.44">you know no jobless claims there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="425.19" dur="5.64">continue</text>
  <text start="426.32" dur="6.49">jobless claims and the claims trend</text>
  <text start="430.83" dur="4.77">remains at the lowest level seen in</text>
  <text start="432.81" dur="6.15">decades that means no one&amp;#39;s getting laid</text>
  <text start="435.6" dur="6.78">off and no one&amp;#39;s making claims does that</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="7.02">make any sense well we have to go back</text>
  <text start="442.38" dur="5.58">and remember that the United States got</text>
  <text start="445.98" dur="4.68">rid of the department that counts</text>
  <text start="447.96" dur="4.35">layoffs back in 2013 so there&amp;#39;s no one</text>
  <text start="450.66" dur="3.39">to confirm that there are people getting</text>
  <text start="452.31" dur="6.12">laid off because they don&amp;#39;t have they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="454.05" dur="5.97">not you know recording this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="458.43" dur="5.4">just manipulating the claim numbers</text>
  <text start="460.02" dur="7.17">because when we go to challenger which</text>
  <text start="463.83" dur="9.81">is a private company where they record</text>
  <text start="467.19" dur="12.48">the layoffs well something doesn&amp;#39;t add</text>
  <text start="473.64" dur="11.04">up the third quarter ended with a surge</text>
  <text start="479.67" dur="9.66">in job cuts a US based employers</text>

  <text start="517.919" dur="7.891">month a year ago hmm very interesting in</text>

  <text start="556.79" dur="7.27">anyone see the similarities I do</text>
  <text start="559.74" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;re not in a recovery it even gets</text>
  <text start="564.06" dur="4.83">even more confusing when you look at the</text>
  <text start="565.8" dur="7.31">full year trend when one notice is that</text>
  <text start="568.89" dur="9.78">so far in 2015 employers have announced</text>

  <text start="583.17" dur="6.21">track from January through September a</text>
  <text start="585.42" dur="6.89">year ago so the year-to-date total is</text>
  <text start="589.38" dur="5.88">actually two percent higher than the</text>
  <text start="592.31" dur="4.96">2014 year-end total of four hundred and</text>
  <text start="595.26" dur="7.86">eighty-three thousand and we&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="597.27" dur="10.35">finished with the year so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="603.12" dur="6.03">happening here someone is lying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.62" dur="5.61">either the private company challenge</text>
  <text start="609.15" dur="7.77">challenger gray &amp;amp; christmas or it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="613.23" dur="6.66">department of labor who do you think it</text>
  <text start="616.92" dur="7.02">is well i know who it is definitely the</text>
  <text start="619.89" dur="5.85">government because everything that we</text>
  <text start="623.94" dur="5.25">looked at and everything that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="625.74" dur="5.55">doing their numbers make no sense</text>
  <text start="629.19" dur="3.66">whatsoever because all you have to do is</text>
  <text start="631.29" dur="4.58">say okay we&amp;#39;re at five point one percent</text>
  <text start="632.85" dur="6.98">unemployment but retail sales are down</text>
  <text start="635.87" dur="3.96">mortgage applications are down</text>

  <text start="670.08" dur="8.34">recovery it&amp;#39;s non-existent what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="675.54" dur="5.58">interesting in Illinois this is the only</text>
  <text start="678.42" dur="5.28">state in the Midwest to have added more</text>
  <text start="681.12" dur="4.46">people to food stamp rolls than to</text>
  <text start="683.7" dur="6.57">employment rolls during the recovery</text>
  <text start="685.58" dur="6.919">from the Great Recession so think about</text>

  <text start="723.759" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re going to use their fancy</text>
  <text start="725.439" dur="3.75">calculations and throw things in from</text>
  <text start="727.479" dur="4.53">all over the place to bring this number</text>
  <text start="729.189" dur="5.82">up but the Atlanta Fed right now has</text>

  <text start="738.699" dur="3.93">say really reporting yeah you really</text>
  <text start="740.499" dur="3.59">need to take out you know research and</text>

  <text start="744.089" dur="4.06">Obamacare and many other things but</text>
  <text start="746.829" dur="4.77">let&amp;#39;s just use their number there at</text>

  <text start="751.599" dur="3.42">number is going to be revised down once</text>
  <text start="753.309" dur="3.9">again but we&amp;#39;ll have to see what the</text>
  <text start="755.019" dur="5.04">government does because they always like</text>
  <text start="757.209" dur="5.1">to tweak it a little bit and bring it</text>
  <text start="760.059" dur="5.161">way up to convince everyone that we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="788.22" dur="6.459">we don&amp;#39;t think QE or the zero percent</text>
