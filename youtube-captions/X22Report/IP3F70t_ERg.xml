  <text start="145.4" dur="6.449">coming out with their information we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="148.34" dur="7.95">starting to realize that everything is</text>
  <text start="151.849" dur="8.721">continually manipulated but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="156.29" dur="7.74">odd is that since that surge in December</text>
  <text start="160.57" dur="6.22">ADP employment change has dramatic</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="7.77">dropped and we&amp;#39;re seeing initial jobless</text>
  <text start="166.79" dur="6.45">claims trend upward which shows us that</text>
  <text start="171.8" dur="5.63">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder for the</text>
  <text start="173.24" dur="7.8">manipulation people can&amp;#39;t find jobs and</text>
  <text start="177.43" dur="6.52">the jobs that people are getting as we</text>
  <text start="181.04" dur="5.49">know are part time if they get one two</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="5.28">three jobs guess what they&amp;#39;re counted as</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="4.47">one two three full-time jobs so</text>
  <text start="189.23" dur="6.72">everything is completely manipulated to</text>
  <text start="191" dur="10.2">make everyone feel that the country is</text>
  <text start="195.95" dur="7.53">doing fine but that&amp;#39;s not the case we</text>
  <text start="201.2" dur="4.65">look at real estate there are bubbles</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="4.41">everywhere in the real estate market</text>
  <text start="205.85" dur="7.109">actually real estate is one gigantic</text>
  <text start="207.89" dur="7.95">bubble and it&amp;#39;s starting to pop I mean</text>
  <text start="212.959" dur="6.871">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="5.729">number of sales they are declining we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.83" dur="5.25">starting to see that prices have</text>
  <text start="221.569" dur="5.731">flatlined and in many areas they are</text>
  <text start="225.08" dur="5.48">coming down many people are now emailing</text>
  <text start="227.3" dur="6.3">me saying yes I am seeing it in my area</text>
  <text start="230.56" dur="5.59">people have homes on the market now for</text>
  <text start="233.6" dur="5.97">90 180 days they are continually</text>
  <text start="236.15" dur="9.02">lowering their prices and in New York</text>
  <text start="239.57" dur="10.05">we&amp;#39;re seeing that sales have declined</text>
  <text start="245.17" dur="8.83">since the last portion of 2015 going in</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="11.22">2016 in Miami we see the same thing</text>
  <text start="254" dur="9.96">happening where people are having a huge</text>
  <text start="260.84" dur="5.639">amount of trouble selling their homes</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="5.19">this is how it starts so I went around</text>
  <text start="266.479" dur="4.44">the country and I looked around and I</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="2.91">have some graphs on the x 22 report</text>
  <text start="270.919" dur="2.791">those people on YouTube can see the</text>
  <text start="272.06" dur="5.46">graphs and we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="8.37">decline in prices and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="277.52" dur="7.86">see the sales decline and when I look</text>
  <text start="282.08" dur="8.58">further around the country the real</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="7.77">estate market does not look good now the</text>
  <text start="290.66" dur="4.56">US government central bankers they know</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="3.21">this they know it&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="295.22" dur="2.87">real estate market they can only</text>
  <text start="296.36" dur="3.93">manipulate it so far</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="5.35">they use hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="300.29" dur="6.54">companies foreigners to basically</text>
  <text start="303.44" dur="5.06">purchase these homes with cash to try to</text>
  <text start="306.83" dur="4.26">keep the market up they have the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.5" dur="4.69">keep houses off the market the drive</text>
  <text start="311.09" dur="6.6">prices up and they&amp;#39;ve been doing this</text>
  <text start="313.19" dur="6.54">since 2008 2009 to pump up the market</text>
  <text start="317.69" dur="5.9">once again but they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="319.73" dur="7.5">realize that this cannot continue Li</text>
  <text start="323.59" dur="6.22">pump up the market so they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="327.23" dur="6.9">do what they did back in 2007 going into</text>
  <text start="329.81" dur="8.3">2008 and we know that the pool of</text>
  <text start="334.13" dur="7.5">creditworthy borrowers is finite and</text>
  <text start="338.11" dur="5.17">that&amp;#39;s a problem for them and we can see</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="3.06">this is why they wanted legals coming in</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="4.95">because they can take out more loans and</text>
  <text start="344.69" dur="6.75">blow up the bubble so what do they do to</text>
  <text start="348.23" dur="6.62">get more people in well they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="351.44" dur="6.57">back to what are called liar loans and</text>
  <text start="354.85" dur="7.47">those people with these liar loans guess</text>
  <text start="358.01" dur="9.33">what they can lie about their income and</text>
  <text start="362.32" dur="7.78">it opens up a whole new area of who they</text>
  <text start="367.34" dur="6.15">can let in to take out loans they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.1" dur="6.99">also bringing back the Alt a&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="373.49" dur="6.57">making a comeback thanks to big money</text>
  <text start="377.09" dur="6.54">managers now this time it&amp;#39;s a bit</text>
  <text start="380.06" dur="6.27">different because the large banks are</text>
  <text start="383.63" dur="4.32">steering clear of the market virtually</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="3.75">none of these all a loans are being</text>
  <text start="387.95" dur="4.98">sliced and packaged into securities like</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="4.62">we saw on the subprime instead private</text>
  <text start="392.93" dur="3.87">equity firms hedge funds and molt and</text>
  <text start="394.7" dur="5.58">mutual fund companies are playing a</text>
  <text start="396.8" dur="5.91">larger role as buyers placing the loans</text>
  <text start="400.28" dur="5.07">into private funds that are sold to</text>
  <text start="402.71" dur="9.75">institutional investors and wealthy</text>
  <text start="405.35" dur="10.11">clients here we go again so we have liar</text>
  <text start="412.46" dur="5.07">loans where these are extended to people</text>
  <text start="415.46" dur="4.26">who have no proof of income and we have</text>
  <text start="417.53" dur="3.99">alt egg to bring in more people into the</text>
  <text start="419.72" dur="5.52">market now if we have a healthy market</text>
  <text start="421.52" dur="8.49">and everything is going perfectly where</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s natural you don&amp;#39;t need this but</text>
  <text start="430.01" dur="1.86">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they need to take</text>
  <text start="431.39" dur="2.43">it</text>
  <text start="431.87" dur="5.52">further because this is not going to</text>
  <text start="433.82" dur="5.91">bring in enough people so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.39" dur="6.3">seeing is there are two senators Michael</text>
  <text start="439.73" dur="7.68">Bennet and Johnny Isakson they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="443.69" dur="6.9">creating a new bill called save sounds</text>
  <text start="447.41" dur="8.51">great right sensible accounting value</text>
  <text start="450.59" dur="8.34">energy Amendment 3042 it&amp;#39;s the save Act</text>
  <text start="455.92" dur="6.25">this save Act would effectively further</text>
  <text start="458.93" dur="5.79">subsidize subsidized government-backed</text>
  <text start="462.17" dur="6.63">mortgage loans under the pretense of</text>
  <text start="464.72" dur="8.57">energy efficiency the bill imposes new</text>
  <text start="468.8" dur="8.04">regulations on loans insured by the FHA</text>
  <text start="473.29" dur="5.47">the Federal Housing Administration these</text>
  <text start="476.84" dur="3.81">regulations go further than most of the</text>
  <text start="478.76" dur="3.93">current mortgage rules however because</text>
  <text start="480.65" dur="5.25">they dictate an increase in the amount</text>
  <text start="482.69" dur="8.91">of money that people will be able to</text>
  <text start="485.9" dur="9.53">borrow for example the proposal requires</text>
  <text start="491.6" dur="6.18">the expected energy cost savings from</text>
  <text start="495.43" dur="5.98">conservation programs to be included in</text>
  <text start="497.78" dur="6.21">borrowers debt to income test in other</text>
  <text start="501.41" dur="4.73">words loan applicants will effectively</text>
  <text start="503.99" dur="6.14">have their income increased because</text>
  <text start="506.14" dur="6.76">underwriters will be required to reduce</text>
  <text start="510.13" dur="6.34">borrowers estimated future living</text>
  <text start="512.9" dur="5.7">expenses regardless of whether they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="516.47" dur="4.56">actual living expenses decline in the</text>
  <text start="518.6" dur="5.79">future borrowers would qualify for</text>
  <text start="521.03" dur="7.35">larger FHA loans as a result of this</text>
  <text start="524.39" dur="8.79">requirement overall what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="528.38" dur="7.05">here is the save Act will inflate home</text>
  <text start="533.18" dur="3.96">prices beyond the level that that the</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="4.77">existing federal programs already did</text>
  <text start="537.14" dur="5.48">and the save Act will encourage</text>
  <text start="540.2" dur="4.65">additional borrowing via</text>
  <text start="542.62" dur="5.62">government-backed mortgages with low</text>
  <text start="544.85" dur="6.3">credit standards they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="548.24" dur="6.15">they possibly can to keep these bubbles</text>
  <text start="551.15" dur="7.5">inflated this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing at</text>
  <text start="554.39" dur="7.02">this point why because the system is</text>
  <text start="558.65" dur="4.98">falling apart and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="561.41" dur="4.13">continually fall apart as we move</text>
  <text start="563.63" dur="7.59">forward</text>
  <text start="565.54" dur="8.47">we see markets chief economist well they</text>
