  <text start="87.59" dur="3.389">and we&amp;#39;re gonna be discussing that a</text>
  <text start="88.97" dur="3.99">little bit later in this report and the</text>
  <text start="90.979" dur="4.921">reason why this is all going to change</text>
  <text start="92.96" dur="5.25">is because we&amp;#39;re going to be removing</text>
  <text start="95.9" dur="4.35">the central bank that&amp;#39;s where all this</text>
  <text start="98.21" dur="2.49">is headed I know people don&amp;#39;t believe</text>

  <text start="102.68" dur="5.37">bank will exist forever and ever and</text>
  <text start="104.27" dur="8.18">ever but we are headed to that point</text>
  <text start="108.05" dur="7.11">when the central bank is taken over and</text>
  <text start="112.45" dur="5.92">dismantled and controlled by the people</text>
  <text start="115.16" dur="6.09">that&amp;#39;s where all this is headed and this</text>
  <text start="118.37" dur="6.06">is the plan and we can see already that</text>
  <text start="121.25" dur="5.37">the plan is moving forward and what</text>
  <text start="124.43" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re going to see moving forward here</text>
  <text start="126.62" dur="4.619">is that a lot of things are going to</text>
  <text start="129.11" dur="3.84">change right now the economy is a</text>
  <text start="131.239" dur="3.811">complete and utter disaster it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.95" dur="4.47">breaking down a lot of people can&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="135.05" dur="7.2">this it&amp;#39;s amazing how you can manipulate</text>
  <text start="137.42" dur="6.18">the economic numbers and really keep the</text>
  <text start="142.25" dur="4.32">illusion alive and everyone really</text>
  <text start="143.6" dur="5.46">believes the economy is doing well when</text>
  <text start="146.57" dur="5.15">the economy the under lying the belly of</text>
  <text start="149.06" dur="4.98">the economy is completely</text>
  <text start="151.72" dur="5.41">self-destructing I mean no one saw it</text>
  <text start="154.04" dur="5.13">leading up to 20 2008 I mean there were</text>
  <text start="157.13" dur="3.419">a couple people that saw it but most of</text>
  <text start="159.17" dur="2.819">the people believed that everything was</text>
  <text start="160.549" dur="4.201">fantastic and this was gonna go on</text>
  <text start="161.989" dur="4.171">forever our house values were gonna</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="3.03">continually move up and up and up the</text>
  <text start="166.16" dur="3.299">stock market was going to continually</text>
  <text start="167.78" dur="3.42">move up and up and up and people do</text>
  <text start="169.459" dur="3.481">believe this and then everything started</text>
  <text start="171.2" dur="3.21">to crash down and fall apart everyone</text>
  <text start="172.94" dur="2.85">believed the subprime securities were</text>
  <text start="174.41" dur="3.63">triple-a rating because that&amp;#39;s what we</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="5.04">were told and that completely fell apart</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="5.07">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a very</text>
  <text start="180.83" dur="4.86">slow deterioration this is all behind</text>
  <text start="183.11" dur="5.04">the scenes outside of the manipulation</text>
  <text start="185.69" dur="6.27">of what they&amp;#39;re really not talking about</text>
  <text start="188.15" dur="7.02">how the auto industry is hurting right</text>

  <text start="203.36" dur="5.31">while but they&amp;#39;re accelerating all of</text>
  <text start="205.4" dur="6.03">this now in less than a month ago we</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="4.29">showed how the auto industry was</text>
  <text start="211.43" dur="3.69">completely falling apart</text>

  <text start="430.58" dur="5.13">in 20 cities they couldn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="432.919" dur="5.281">throughout the entire US they picked the</text>
  <text start="435.71" dur="6.75">20 cities that they cover and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="438.2" dur="6.48">able to maneuver and create the illusion</text>
  <text start="442.46" dur="4.74">that the housing market is doing well</text>
  <text start="444.68" dur="4.26">and when people think of the housing</text>
  <text start="447.2" dur="4.95">market doing well all they think of is</text>
  <text start="448.94" dur="4.26">home prices going up if you heard home</text>
  <text start="452.15" dur="3.12">prices going down</text>
  <text start="453.2" dur="3.96">you think the housing market is doing</text>
  <text start="455.27" dur="4.05">very poorly and people feel very</text>
  <text start="457.16" dur="4.5">confident when the housing market there</text>
  <text start="459.32" dur="4.2">prices are going up and they go out and</text>
  <text start="461.66" dur="3.75">they spend money I just made a lot of</text>
  <text start="463.52" dur="3.42">money on my house look I bought it for</text>
  <text start="465.41" dur="3.9">two hundred thousand it&amp;#39;s worth three</text>
  <text start="466.94" dur="4.77">hundred thousand but really they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="469.31" dur="4.95">made anything it&amp;#39;s all on paper and</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="5.34">there&amp;#39;s nothing they can use unless they</text>
  <text start="474.26" dur="4.98">refinance unless they take out another</text>
  <text start="477.05" dur="3.93">mortgage unless they do something to</text>
  <text start="479.24" dur="4.2">take the funds out of it but you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.98" dur="5.52">actually borrowing that and you have to</text>
  <text start="483.44" dur="5.07">repay it with interest so this is really</text>
  <text start="486.5" dur="4.82">not a good idea but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="488.51" dur="5.88">right now is that the whole entire</text>
  <text start="491.32" dur="6.55">housing market the automobile industry</text>
  <text start="494.39" dur="6.54">it&amp;#39;s all falling apart and the first</text>
  <text start="497.87" dur="5.97">quarter of this year of 2018 was a</text>
  <text start="500.93" dur="5.72">disaster for America I mean if we look</text>
  <text start="503.84" dur="8.01">from January 1st 2018 through March 28th</text>
  <text start="506.65" dur="8.14">2018 real GDP likely grew at 110 billion</text>
  <text start="511.85" dur="6">a 2.5 percent rise on an annualized</text>
  <text start="514.79" dur="5.79">basis however if we look deeper into all</text>
  <text start="517.85" dur="5.55">these numbers this is not necessarily</text>
  <text start="520.58" dur="6.15">true according to the Treasury from</text>
  <text start="523.4" dur="6.48">January 1st 2018 through March 28th 2018</text>
  <text start="526.73" dur="6.27">federal debt rose by an astounding 621</text>
  <text start="529.88" dur="5.58">billion dollars a 13.1 percent increase</text>
  <text start="533" dur="5.49">on an annualized basis and when we look</text>
  <text start="535.46" dur="4.56">at this and we see the quarterly change</text>
  <text start="538.49" dur="4.44">in federal debt versus the quarterly</text>
  <text start="540.02" dur="5.58">change in real GDP since 2000 the first</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="4.8">quarter of 2018 was the second largest</text>
  <text start="545.6" dur="4.17">quarterly growth in federal debt only</text>
  <text start="547.73" dur="5.58">surpassed by the massive free-spending</text>
  <text start="549.77" dur="6.36">of the fourth quarter of 2008 now if we</text>
  <text start="553.31" dur="5.43">subtract the quarterly growth in federal</text>
  <text start="556.13" dur="5.43">debt from the growth and real GDP what</text>
  <text start="558.74" dur="5.4">do we get well the first quart of 2018</text>
  <text start="561.56" dur="4.65">shows that it&amp;#39;s the worst quarters on</text>
  <text start="564.14" dur="4.77">record with the growth in federal debt</text>
  <text start="566.21" dur="5.49">doing laps around the growth in gross</text>
  <text start="568.91" dur="6.24">domestic product remember we incurred</text>
  <text start="571.7" dur="7.44">over 621 billion in new debt to produce</text>
  <text start="575.15" dur="8.51">just over 100 billion in new economic</text>
  <text start="579.14" dur="7.33">activity so we took out 621 dollars in</text>
  <text start="583.66" dur="5.48">debt now we have to repay</text>
  <text start="586.47" dur="3.75">to produce a hundred billion I mean does</text>
  <text start="589.14" dur="5.49">that sound good</text>
  <text start="590.22" dur="7.13">no which shows that the GDP is negative</text>
  <text start="594.63" dur="6.33">point five one I mean if we go back to</text>
  <text start="597.35" dur="5.86">2008 the GDP was negative point nine</text>
  <text start="600.96" dur="5.01">nine actually if you look at all the</text>
  <text start="603.21" dur="7.14">quarters from 2008 all the way up to</text>
  <text start="605.97" dur="6.38">2018 95 percent is in the negative</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="5.85">territory I mean this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="612.35" dur="5.11">awful and again they spin it to make it</text>
  <text start="616.2" dur="2.67">look like and they keep us in this</text>
  <text start="617.46" dur="3.15">illusion that everything is great</text>
  <text start="618.87" dur="3.45">well Goldman Sachs they&amp;#39;re telling their</text>
  <text start="620.61" dur="2.91">clients right now you better start</text>
  <text start="622.32" dur="3.54">preparing for the worst</text>
  <text start="623.52" dur="4.47">because what is happening right now is</text>
  <text start="625.86" dur="6.48">that and we talked about this before</text>
  <text start="627.99" dur="7.71">Trump is pushing his agenda his agenda</text>
  <text start="632.34" dur="4.74">is to crash this system and people say</text>
  <text start="635.7" dur="2.13">oh why would he want to crash this this</text>
  <text start="637.08" dur="3.93">makes no sense</text>
  <text start="637.83" dur="5.76">yes it does this system is a central</text>
  <text start="641.01" dur="4.89">bank system this is not a people system</text>
  <text start="643.59" dur="4.95">this is a system that was created</text>
  <text start="645.9" dur="5.94">developed by the central bankers to</text>
  <text start="648.54" dur="6.72">profit them to enslave the people</text>
  <text start="651.84" dur="8.43">to make you continually work and devalue</text>
