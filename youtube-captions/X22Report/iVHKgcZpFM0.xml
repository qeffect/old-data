  <text start="121.42" dur="6.21">continued to high-level trade</text>
  <text start="123.34" dur="7.44">negotiations with the Chinese and when</text>
  <text start="127.63" dur="8.189">the understand and we realize is that</text>
  <text start="130.78" dur="8.19">Trump is creating these deals to benefit</text>
  <text start="135.819" dur="4.861">the United States remember what the</text>
  <text start="138.97" dur="4.34">globalists have done remember what the</text>
  <text start="140.68" dur="8.25">central banks have done they stripped</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="9.19">America of Trade and they benefited</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="6.51">other countries because there are a</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="5.4">whole entire mission was to move</text>
  <text start="155.44" dur="3.51">everything out of the United States and</text>
  <text start="157.9" dur="3.989">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for quite a</text>
  <text start="158.95" dur="6.07">while and now Trump is bringing</text>
  <text start="161.889" dur="7.921">everything back deregulating</text>
  <text start="165.02" dur="7.68">trade deals and at the same time pushing</text>
  <text start="169.81" dur="4.36">the number one agenda and that is</text>
  <text start="172.7" dur="4.71">getting rid of the central bank and why</text>
  <text start="174.17" dur="6.9">do I say this yes we have treasonous</text>
  <text start="177.41" dur="6.27">individuals yes we have traitors yes we</text>
  <text start="181.07" dur="4.32">have people that committed crimes but</text>
  <text start="183.68" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s just the tip of the iceberg</text>
  <text start="185.39" dur="6.45">the real crime is against the American</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="6.54">people by creating this fiat currency</text>
  <text start="191.84" dur="8.13">out of thin air and having a separate</text>
  <text start="195.26" dur="7.31">corporation manage the entire country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="8.43">finances and not just the country but</text>
  <text start="202.57" dur="7.99">the world while attaching interest to</text>
  <text start="208.4" dur="5.58">the mundi they are the currency I should</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="7.38">say that they&amp;#39;re lending to us enslaving</text>
  <text start="213.98" dur="9.45">each and every one of us to the central</text>
  <text start="217.94" dur="7.77">bank the whole entire plan revolves</text>
  <text start="223.43" dur="4.83">around getting rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="225.71" dur="5.04">the central bank is not for the people</text>
  <text start="228.26" dur="5.58">the central bank has no allegiance to a</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="9.27">country the central bank only cares</text>
  <text start="233.84" dur="8.94">about debt profit and control and we can</text>
  <text start="240.02" dur="6.66">see already that Trump has been setting</text>
  <text start="242.78" dur="9">up the Federal Reserve what do I mean by</text>
  <text start="246.68" dur="7.77">this since Trump has taken office he has</text>
  <text start="251.78" dur="7.76">contradicted the Fed over and over again</text>
  <text start="254.45" dur="8.1">and as he continually does this he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.54" dur="5.47">pointing the finger at the Fed shining</text>
  <text start="262.55" dur="5.55">the spotlight on the Fed and making sure</text>
  <text start="265.01" dur="5.22">that everyone understands that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="268.1" dur="4.05">the ones who are going to be responsible</text>
  <text start="270.23" dur="6.45">in the end think about it</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="6.66">Trump came into office took these</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="5.22">statistical numbers manipulated them</text>
  <text start="278.81" dur="5.73">with his magic wand made the economy</text>
  <text start="281.9" dur="3.99">look absolutely fantastic lower the</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="2.03">unemployment like we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="285.89" dur="4.08">before</text>
  <text start="286.57" dur="7.78">GDP shot up stock market at all-time</text>
  <text start="289.97" dur="7.41">highs the Fed because of all this</text>
  <text start="294.35" dur="5.7">because if we go you know before Trump</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="5.16">Obama was out there saying he has the</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="5.46">best economy because he was manipulating</text>
  <text start="302.54" dur="6.78">the numbers Trump took it and decided to</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="6.54">manipulate him a lot more so the Fed and</text>
  <text start="309.32" dur="6.27">the deep states plan was to raise the</text>
  <text start="312.05" dur="7.29">interest rates during this economic boom</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="5.01">time and what they were going to do is</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;re going to raise the rates raise</text>
  <text start="320.6" dur="3.84">the rates and the economy was gonna</text>
  <text start="321.95" dur="5.16">start to fall apart Trump turned it</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="5.43">around on them started to blame the Fed</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="4.71">and continually said listen if you</text>
  <text start="329.87" dur="3.66">continually raise the rates you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="331.82" dur="3.57">hurt the economy every time you do what</text>
  <text start="333.53" dur="3.21">the stock market comes down why would</text>
  <text start="335.39" dur="6.72">you be doing this when we have debt</text>
  <text start="336.74" dur="9.17">coming soon and all of a sudden coming</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="7.56">into 2019 the Fed decided to be patient</text>
  <text start="345.91" dur="6.22">now the Fed decided not to raise any</text>
  <text start="349.67" dur="5.64">rates here in the United States</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="5.6">now step back for a moment when people</text>
  <text start="355.31" dur="6.12">are hearing this and they&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="357.73" dur="6.61">the Fed was telling us telling America</text>

  <text start="378.2" dur="5.96">the unemployment rate came down GDP has</text>
  <text start="381.83" dur="5.22">gone up and the stock market has gone up</text>
  <text start="384.16" dur="6.22">so why in the world with the economy</text>
  <text start="387.05" dur="7.08">getting stronger why in the world would</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="6.87">the Fed not raise rates and why would</text>
  <text start="394.13" dur="6.96">they stop tightening does it make any</text>
  <text start="397.25" dur="5.94">sense no it doesn&amp;#39;t so the people now</text>
  <text start="401.09" dur="4.59">are looking at the Fed and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="403.19" dur="4.5">saying wait a minute the economy was</text>
  <text start="405.68" dur="3.48">doing well and you&amp;#39;re telling us because</text>
  <text start="407.69" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s doing well we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="409.16" dur="3.96">raising more interest rates and because</text>
  <text start="411.44" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s doing well we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="4.41">tightening now the economy is doing even</text>
  <text start="415.73" dur="5.52">better if you look at these statistical</text>
  <text start="417.53" dur="6">numbers and you decided not to do you</text>
  <text start="421.25" dur="6.72">understand the economy is there</text>
  <text start="423.53" dur="5.81">something wrong now if the economy</text>
  <text start="427.97" dur="2.52">starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="429.34" dur="4.27">who</text>
  <text start="430.49" dur="6.03">to blame well Trump can easily turn</text>
  <text start="433.61" dur="5.73">around and say listen I had the economy</text>
  <text start="436.52" dur="6.06">roaring they decided to stop raising</text>
  <text start="439.34" dur="6.84">interest rates they decided not to</text>
  <text start="442.58" dur="5.88">tighten anymore now if the Fed decides</text>
  <text start="446.18" dur="4.829">to raise interest rates Trump can now</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="4.53">say listen I have the economy doing</text>
  <text start="451.009" dur="4.291">perfectly well they decided to raise</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="4.56">interest rates and they decided to</text>
  <text start="455.3" dur="5.31">unwind their balance sheet they brought</text>
  <text start="457.55" dur="6.78">the economy down basically what Trump</text>
  <text start="460.61" dur="8.16">has done is he&amp;#39;s cornered the Fed and</text>
  <text start="464.33" dur="7.589">the Fed no matter which way it goes will</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="5.85">be blamed for bringing down the economy</text>
  <text start="471.919" dur="6.771">the feds credibility right now has been</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="7.43">reduced to zero because Trump is</text>
  <text start="478.69" dur="5.77">continually pushing the economy and</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="4.149">making it better and better and better</text>
  <text start="484.46" dur="3.12">of course this is all statistical and</text>
  <text start="486.199" dur="4.22">every time he brings back manufacturing</text>
  <text start="487.58" dur="5.76">every time he brings back businesses</text>
  <text start="490.419" dur="3.941">everyone sees this and everyone said</text>
  <text start="493.34" dur="3.419">this is fantastic</text>
  <text start="494.36" dur="5.46">every time Trump says we just added</text>
  <text start="496.759" dur="5.461">another 10,000 jobs everyone sees this</text>
  <text start="499.82" dur="4.62">and says wow the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="502.22" dur="4.56">fantastically now the Fed is</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="3.779">flip-flopping back and forth they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.78" dur="3.9">going in all different directions now</text>
  <text start="508.219" dur="7.141">and what they&amp;#39;re doing doesn&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="510.68" dur="8.549">sense this was part of the plan this was</text>
  <text start="515.36" dur="8.13">the plan to show that the Fed has no</text>
  <text start="519.229" dur="8.36">clue in what the economy is doing they</text>
  <text start="523.49" dur="8.57">have no idea how to control it how to</text>
  <text start="527.589" dur="6.911">maintain it and all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="4.779">flip-flopping back and forth the</text>
  <text start="534.5" dur="4.17">unemployment numbers come down well</text>
  <text start="536.839" dur="4.111">we&amp;#39;re gonna raise rates the unemployment</text>
  <text start="538.67" dur="5.25">numbers come down even further we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="540.95" dur="6.389">going to stop raising rates it makes no</text>
  <text start="543.92" dur="5.88">sense they&amp;#39;ve backed well actually Trump</text>
  <text start="547.339" dur="5.671">and the Patriots have back them into a</text>
  <text start="549.8" dur="7.74">corner and now no matter which way they</text>
  <text start="553.01" dur="7.23">go they are doomed and we can see at</text>
  <text start="557.54" dur="5.28">this time this has been the plan all</text>
  <text start="560.24" dur="3.3">along because we know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="562.82" dur="4.38">happen</text>
  <text start="563.54" dur="7.65">in 2020 Trump will win the election and</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="7.62">this is when the fun starts this is when</text>
  <text start="571.19" dur="5.84">the transition begins am I saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="574.82" dur="6.57">gonna happen right after he&amp;#39;s elected no</text>
  <text start="577.03" dur="8.11">but he&amp;#39;s going to prep the country now</text>
  <text start="581.39" dur="6">think about it back in 1971 Nixon came</text>
  <text start="585.14" dur="3.87">out and said listen we&amp;#39;re coming off the</text>
  <text start="587.39" dur="4.83">gold standard because of speculators</text>
  <text start="589.01" dur="5.34">they made up this entire story and of</text>
  <text start="592.22" dur="4.35">course back then there was no internet</text>
  <text start="594.35" dur="4.2">we just believed whatever they were</text>
  <text start="596.57" dur="4.71">saying and everyone went along with it</text>
  <text start="598.55" dur="3.81">and it allowed the Fed to create</text>
  <text start="601.28" dur="2.94">currency actually they were creating a</text>
  <text start="602.36" dur="2.94">lot of currency before that and this is</text>
  <text start="604.22" dur="3.3">why they had to come off the gold</text>
  <text start="605.3" dur="4.89">standard because countries were figuring</text>
  <text start="607.52" dur="5.84">it out Trump now is going to come out</text>
  <text start="610.19" dur="6.96">and everything is going to be reversed</text>
  <text start="613.36" dur="9.25">how was he going to do this well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="617.15" dur="8.6">very simple the Fed raises rates brings</text>
  <text start="622.61" dur="5.64">down the economy the economy comes down</text>
  <text start="625.75" dur="4.21">Trump says hey I was doing a great job</text>
  <text start="628.25" dur="4.02">what happened here</text>
  <text start="629.96" dur="5.28">I was bringing back jobs what happened</text>
  <text start="632.27" dur="6.09">here i deregulated economy was roaring</text>
  <text start="635.24" dur="5.67">the Fed decided to step in raise and</text>
  <text start="638.36" dur="5.64">they started to raise rates I told him</text>
  <text start="640.91" dur="4.92">not to I told him this is a bad idea too</text>
  <text start="644" dur="4.02">much debt the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="645.83" dur="3.86">fantastically I&amp;#39;d keep the rates where</text>
  <text start="648.02" dur="5.43">they are but they didn&amp;#39;t listen they</text>
  <text start="649.69" dur="5.26">decided to do it anyhow and all of a</text>
  <text start="653.45" dur="2.88">sudden the economy started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="654.95" dur="4.89">the stock market started to come down</text>
  <text start="656.33" dur="5.49">and everything started to crash Trump</text>
  <text start="659.84" dur="5.13">during this period of time will</text>
  <text start="661.82" dur="5.76">continually point a finger at the Fed at</text>
  <text start="664.97" dur="6.57">this point that people will become angry</text>
  <text start="667.58" dur="6.96">at this point this is when Trump will</text>
  <text start="671.54" dur="4.89">start pushing the idea of an audit Trump</text>
  <text start="674.54" dur="3.81">will start pushing the idea that maybe</text>
  <text start="676.43" dur="3.78">we should look into the business of the</text>
  <text start="678.35" dur="5.01">Fed since they are managing the country</text>
  <text start="680.21" dur="5.61">we should know as a people what they are</text>
  <text start="683.36" dur="5.94">doing and this is when you&amp;#39;ll see the</text>
  <text start="685.82" dur="6.6">bills start to move in the Senate in the</text>
  <text start="689.3" dur="4.47">house and will be pushed to the</text>
  <text start="692.42" dur="5.31">president remember</text>
  <text start="693.77" dur="7.74">just like the deep state they use events</text>
  <text start="697.73" dur="6">to push their legislation well the good</text>
  <text start="701.51" dur="6.12">guys the white hats can do the same</text>
  <text start="703.73" dur="7.4">exact thing they can use events to push</text>
  <text start="707.63" dur="7.68">legislation and we&amp;#39;ve seen this already</text>
  <text start="711.13" dur="6.22">we&amp;#39;ve seen certain events that have been</text>
  <text start="715.31" dur="5.25">used to push legislation think of the</text>
  <text start="717.35" dur="5.64">national emergency of course this event</text>
  <text start="720.56" dur="4.92">was created by the deep state but it was</text>
  <text start="722.99" dur="4.92">used against them the same things gonna</text>
  <text start="725.48" dur="6.48">happen with the Federal Reserve this</text>
  <text start="727.91" dur="6.66">event of a crisis is going to create an</text>
