  <text start="77.04" dur="4.59">system well it&amp;#39;s coming to an end and</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="3.57">they need to reset it they understand</text>
  <text start="81.63" dur="5.129">this they realize this and they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="83.04" dur="6.71">nervous about other currencies taking</text>
  <text start="86.759" dur="5.701">the place of their fiat currency and</text>
  <text start="89.75" dur="4.39">they&amp;#39;re worried about gold and silver of</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="4.89">course they have been throughout</text>
  <text start="94.14" dur="6.69">thousands of years they&amp;#39;re very worried</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="5.61">about crypto currencies and we know and</text>
  <text start="100.83" dur="4.92">we said this in past interviews and past</text>
  <text start="102.96" dur="5.46">reports where we said they would be able</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="7.08">to manipulate it with the paper market</text>
  <text start="108.42" dur="7.08">or by selling a lot of Bitcoin to show</text>
  <text start="112.83" dur="3.81">people that it&amp;#39;s very volatile and this</text>
  <text start="115.5" dur="4.14">is pretty much what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="116.64" dur="7.17">they&amp;#39;ve been controlling it to convince</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="6.78">everyone that the crypto market is not a</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="6.119">place that you want to be and I am</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="5.49">thinking back to the 1970s when we were</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="4.351">coming off the gold standard of course</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="4.56">at that time what did they say because</text>
  <text start="134.28" dur="4.83">of speculation because of other</text>
  <text start="136.47" dur="4.92">countries speculating in the gold market</text>
  <text start="139.11" dur="4.91">we need to detach ourselves from the</text>
  <text start="141.39" dur="5.76">gold market we need to go full Fiat and</text>
  <text start="144.02" dur="5.23">once that happened they said gold is no</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="2.82">good anymore it&amp;#39;s a barbarous relic it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.25" dur="3.27">meaningless</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="4.86">everything everyone look at the paper</text>
  <text start="152.52" dur="6.53">market think about what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="154.83" dur="6.87">right now they&amp;#39;re telling everyone the</text>
  <text start="159.05" dur="7.17">blockchain system the cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="7.2">on the blockchain they&amp;#39;re volatile</text>
  <text start="166.22" dur="5.08">criminals use them terrorists use them</text>
  <text start="168.9" dur="4.52">you shouldn&amp;#39;t even touch them they even</text>
  <text start="171.3" dur="5.37">have articles coming out saying oh I owe</text>
  <text start="173.42" dur="5.26">$50,000 in taxes because I sold my</text>
  <text start="176.67" dur="5.58">cryptocurrency I don&amp;#39;t know how to pay</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="8.22">this off now they&amp;#39;re using fear tactic</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="6.93">on every single level to</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="4.619">get people away from cryptocurrency why</text>
  <text start="189.18" dur="4.169">why are they so nervous about</text>
  <text start="191.519" dur="2.911">cryptocurrency first of all see</text>
  <text start="193.349" dur="2.73">centralized I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="194.43" dur="6">saying that no it&amp;#39;s not decentralized</text>
  <text start="196.079" dur="7.981">yes it is it&amp;#39;s decentralized in every</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="7.83">single part of the world it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="6.929">in one country and once miners start to</text>
  <text start="208.26" dur="5.28">mine it guess what yes people can add on</text>
  <text start="210.989" dur="3.931">two different crypto currencies but what</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="5.16">happens is when you start to mine it</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="6.42">guess what it&amp;#39;s all over the place now</text>
  <text start="218.7" dur="6.33">the exchanges well that is a choke point</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="5.66">it&amp;#39;s following the old model of banking</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="5.269">and everything else that we know of but</text>
  <text start="227" dur="6.4">coming soon is there going to be</text>
  <text start="230.299" dur="4.3">decentralized exchanges I mean right now</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="3.929">they force coinbase</text>
  <text start="234.599" dur="4.92">to hand over all the information on</text>
  <text start="237.329" dur="6.75">those people that cash down into fiat</text>
  <text start="239.519" dur="7.05">currency when it&amp;#39;s decentralized where</text>
  <text start="244.079" dur="3.901">are they going to go this is what</text>
  <text start="246.569" dur="3.361">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about this is why</text>
  <text start="247.98" dur="3.569">they&amp;#39;re looking for regulations this is</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="5.489">why they want laws passed this is how</text>
  <text start="251.549" dur="8.011">the central bankers work they push the</text>
  <text start="255.419" dur="7.051">price of a currency up or down or</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="6.12">precious metals what money they push it</text>
  <text start="262.47" dur="5.28">up and down they make it look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="5.34">uncontrollable and then they start</text>
  <text start="267.75" dur="5.97">demonizing it then they push the idea</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="5.16">that now there needs to be some type of</text>
  <text start="273.72" dur="5.46">regulation to control it and they want</text>
  <text start="276.18" dur="4.5">governments to pass these laws so they</text>
  <text start="279.18" dur="4.26">can stay in power this is what they did</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="5.13">to the dollar before the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="283.44" dur="5.039">controlled it this is what they did the</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="4.349">gold and silver this is what they do</text>
  <text start="288.479" dur="3.781">with everything but the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="290.159" dur="4.32">market is a little more difficult</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="6.839">because it&amp;#39;s not just in one place and</text>
  <text start="294.479" dur="6.301">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to rein in and this</text>
  <text start="299.099" dur="4.111">is the problem that they&amp;#39;re having even</text>
  <text start="300.78" dur="4.889">if you place regulations where you say</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="4.86">oh if you cash out of cryptocurrency and</text>
  <text start="305.669" dur="4.951">you&amp;#39;re on a decentralized exchange</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="6.86">system well it&amp;#39;s gonna be very difficult</text>
  <text start="310.62" dur="6.93">to get that tax money from you because</text>
  <text start="314.93" dur="5.86">what are they gonna do go to every</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="5.97">single computer Center with the extreme</text>
  <text start="320.79" dur="6">change is being done it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="323.52" dur="6.15">completely impossible this is why the</text>
  <text start="326.79" dur="6.57">central banks of central banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.67" dur="6.99">gonna want every single country to</text>
  <text start="333.36" dur="5.64">impose the same regulations this is why</text>
  <text start="336.66" dur="4.83">the IMF is out there calling for global</text>
  <text start="339" dur="5.04">regulations the problem is there are</text>
  <text start="341.49" dur="5.25">certain countries where they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="344.04" dur="4.83">control what do they do with those</text>
  <text start="346.74" dur="3.75">countries and what happens if this</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="4.86">country says yes in this country says</text>
  <text start="350.49" dur="5.79">now it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult this</text>
  <text start="353.73" dur="4.89">is why they wanted a one world monetary</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="3.93">system one world government they</text>
  <text start="358.62" dur="4.77">wouldn&amp;#39;t have to they wouldn&amp;#39;t run into</text>
  <text start="360.21" dur="4.98">these type of problems so it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="363.39" dur="3.6">be very very difficult for them to</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="3.96">control the crypto market and as it</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="3.8">becomes more and more advanced it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.15" dur="4.62">going to become out of their reach and</text>
  <text start="370.79" dur="7.54">they&amp;#39;ll be left behind the central</text>
  <text start="373.77" dur="6.74">banking system is a relic they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="5.16">going to exist in the future</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="4.23">they think they&amp;#39;re gonna exist but</text>
  <text start="383.49" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re gonna be put out of business</text>
  <text start="384.74" dur="8.17">because they are the barbarous relic now</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="6.69">Soros which is very interesting he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.91" dur="5.37">seeing how the price of cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="396.12" dur="5.61">have come down of course this was done</text>
  <text start="398.28" dur="5.34">on purpose and allegedly he wants to</text>
  <text start="401.73" dur="3.69">start trading cryptocurrency you think</text>
  <text start="403.62" dur="3.99">they did this on purpose because they</text>
  <text start="405.42" dur="5.43">wanted to get up get in at the low point</text>
  <text start="407.61" dur="6.27">and now bring it right back up and then</text>
  <text start="410.85" dur="5.4">maybe mount Cox will once again sell the</text>
  <text start="413.88" dur="4.41">Bitcoin to bring it back down this is a</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="4.92">game to them this is the only way they</text>
  <text start="418.29" dur="4.53">can control it by the way and it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="421.17" dur="2.91">Bitcoin that they&amp;#39;re controlling I mean</text>
  <text start="422.82" dur="4.62">they ain&amp;#39;t not gonna control thousands</text>
  <text start="424.08" dur="6.18">of different cryptocurrencies but people</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="6.42">are still making a huge amount of money</text>
  <text start="430.26" dur="5.49">off of the crypto market I mean in the</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="3.9">old days you just held it and it just</text>
  <text start="435.75" dur="3.87">kept going up today the world is</text>
  <text start="437.76" dur="5.07">different again we move to the next</text>
  <text start="439.62" dur="8.4">level and you need to know how to get in</text>
  <text start="442.83" dur="6.9">and out of it to make profits and to be</text>
  <text start="448.02" dur="5.88">in cryptocurrency because eventually</text>
  <text start="449.73" dur="4.95">what&amp;#39;s going to happen well employers</text>
  <text start="453.9" dur="3.239">are going to start paying</text>
  <text start="454.68" dur="4.34">people in it companies are going to</text>
  <text start="457.139" dur="4.171">accept it which they already are and</text>
  <text start="459.02" dur="4.3">there&amp;#39;s not much they really need to do</text>
  <text start="461.31" dur="5.76">you have a phone you have the internet</text>
  <text start="463.32" dur="5.129">you&amp;#39;re really set to go so we can see</text>
  <text start="467.07" dur="3.12">this is the wave of the future just like</text>
  <text start="468.449" dur="4.981">the internet was when people were like</text>
  <text start="470.19" dur="4.979">oh you know the Internet&amp;#39;s a dial-up</text>
  <text start="473.43" dur="3.829">right now it&amp;#39;s too slow it can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="475.169" dur="4.5">anything hmm we&amp;#39;ve heard that before</text>
  <text start="477.259" dur="3.611">where they&amp;#39;re saying bitcoin is too slow</text>
  <text start="479.669" dur="5.25">well you don&amp;#39;t think this is gonna</text>
  <text start="480.87" dur="8.609">change of course I mean look at today we</text>
  <text start="484.919" dur="8.881">want from using these old IBM computers</text>
  <text start="489.479" dur="7.321">on a dial-up or maybe an Atari 130 X C</text>
  <text start="493.8" dur="5.85">or a Commodore 64 to remember that where</text>
  <text start="496.8" dur="7.2">people used to dial-up get on to the</text>
  <text start="499.65" dur="8.85">Internet maybe then using AOL and go to</text>
  <text start="504" dur="6.479">a couple of websites and that was that</text>
  <text start="508.5" dur="3.389">and then people said oh you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.479" dur="2.31">gonna start selling things online and</text>
  <text start="511.889" dur="2.191">people said oh don&amp;#39;t put your credit</text>
  <text start="512.789" dur="4.17">card on there it&amp;#39;s very dangerous very</text>
  <text start="514.08" dur="5.699">dangerous today everyone uses it today</text>
  <text start="516.959" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s superfast everyone can do it</text>
  <text start="519.779" dur="4.891">without being connected anywhere because</text>
  <text start="522.089" dur="5.971">it&amp;#39;s all mobile now the same thing is</text>
  <text start="524.67" dur="7.05">happening with cryptocurrency and this</text>
  <text start="528.06" dur="6">is going to be what countries will use I</text>
  <text start="531.72" dur="4.53">know certain countries are banning it</text>
  <text start="534.06" dur="4.529">because they&amp;#39;re afraid eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.25" dur="5.7">going to happen they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="538.589" dur="7.021">accept it because the people are going</text>
  <text start="541.95" dur="6.78">to force governments to accept it we see</text>
  <text start="545.61" dur="6.93">here in the United States the part-time</text>
  <text start="548.73" dur="6.359">jobs well the numbers have come out now</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="4.95">last month there was a very strong</text>
  <text start="555.089" dur="7.231">establishment survey for payroll numbers</text>
  <text start="557.49" dur="6.51">which was revised even higher to 326,000</text>
  <text start="562.32" dur="4.2">this month there was an even more</text>
  <text start="564" dur="4.86">impressive number a record 1 million</text>
  <text start="566.52" dur="5.129">full and part-time jobs that were added</text>
  <text start="568.86" dur="6.66">according to the household survey now</text>
  <text start="571.649" dur="6.991">this is what happened last month this</text>
  <text start="575.52" dur="5.28">month well it looks like there might</text>
  <text start="578.64" dur="4.56">have been a problem because according to</text>
  <text start="580.8" dur="4.17">the latest data seven hundred and</text>
  <text start="583.2" dur="4.8">twenty-nine thousand full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="584.97" dur="6.929">added in February it was a fluke</text>
  <text start="588" dur="9.029">and the March number the number actually</text>
  <text start="591.899" dur="8.971">declined to 311,000 you know this number</text>
  <text start="597.029" dur="7.651">is gonna go even further to the downside</text>
  <text start="600.87" dur="5.579">you know that whatever they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="604.68" dur="5.339">whatever manipulation they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="606.449" dur="5.461">right now is basically the same</text>
  <text start="610.019" dur="4.56">manipulation they&amp;#39;ve been doing since</text>
  <text start="611.91" dur="5.64">2008 to make us believe that everything</text>
  <text start="614.579" dur="7.13">is great now you have to wonder Trump</text>
  <text start="617.55" dur="7.68">came into the presidency and he kept</text>
  <text start="621.709" dur="5.141">everything exactly the same he didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="625.23" dur="4.56">in there and say oh these numbers are</text>
  <text start="626.85" dur="7.349">fake that&amp;#39;s fake that&amp;#39;s fake he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="629.79" dur="8.52">do that he wanted the BLS and the rest</text>
  <text start="634.199" dur="8.281">of the reporting to continue on the way</text>
  <text start="638.31" dur="7.17">it is why think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="642.48" dur="5.58">why didn&amp;#39;t he change any of this why</text>
  <text start="645.48" dur="3.87">Denis call all these numbers completely</text>
  <text start="648.06" dur="3.089">fake phony and false we know they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="663.809" dur="6.301">haywire the deep state the whole thing</text>
  <text start="666.809" dur="6.121">because he&amp;#39;ll be referring to Obama&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="672.93" dur="7.05">over well what he&amp;#39;s been doing is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="676.589" dur="5.67">been trying to gain new narrative the</text>
  <text start="679.98" dur="4.649">narrative of how this system is gonna be</text>
  <text start="682.259" dur="5.88">coming down and he&amp;#39;s putting he&amp;#39;s put</text>

  <text start="700.17" dur="3.539">already lost the trade wars and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="702.389" dur="4.531">doing this very very slowly remember</text>
  <text start="703.709" dur="4.651">when you first started to wake up you</text>
  <text start="706.92" dur="2.609">couldn&amp;#39;t receive all the information at</text>
  <text start="708.36" dur="3.269">once because you didn&amp;#39;t want to hear it</text>
  <text start="709.529" dur="3.391">you only wanted to hear little bits and</text>
  <text start="711.629" dur="3">pieces that you wanted to hear I</text>
  <text start="712.92" dur="3.24">remember when I was waking up I just</text>
  <text start="714.629" dur="3.63">wanted to hear the economic information</text>
  <text start="716.16" dur="4.44">I know one here everything else and then</text>
  <text start="718.259" dur="3.591">slowly I moved into all the other areas</text>
  <text start="720.6" dur="3.02">and a lot of</text>
  <text start="721.85" dur="4.5">said the same same exact thing because</text>
  <text start="723.62" dur="5.79">the economic was oh okay they manipulate</text>
  <text start="726.35" dur="5.429">unemployment I get that okay the stock</text>
  <text start="729.41" dur="5.07">market well there might be manipulation</text>
  <text start="731.779" dur="6.93">in there I get that and it goes on and</text>
  <text start="734.48" dur="7.95">on and on what he&amp;#39;s doing right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="738.709" dur="7.38">out there telling the public that the</text>
  <text start="742.43" dur="6.57">market might take a hit we might feel a</text>
  <text start="746.089" dur="6.631">little pain now you need to prepare the</text>
  <text start="749" dur="6.209">country for what is about to happen yes</text>
  <text start="752.72" dur="5.489">we understand that this whole entire</text>
  <text start="755.209" dur="5.701">economic system is fake we get it we</text>
  <text start="758.209" dur="6.481">know it&amp;#39;s going to collapse most of</text>
  <text start="760.91" dur="6.599">America does not and what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="764.69" dur="4.47">right now he&amp;#39;s letting out a little bit</text>
  <text start="767.509" dur="3.661">of information at a time because he</text>
  <text start="769.16" dur="4.349">needs to gain the narrative of what is</text>
  <text start="771.17" dur="5.46">going to happen now the White House says</text>
  <text start="773.509" dur="5.88">they recognize that Trump&amp;#39;s actions are</text>
  <text start="776.63" dur="4.829">hitting the stock market but there is a</text>
  <text start="779.389" dur="3.51">longer-term thing and the president has</text>
  <text start="781.459" dur="5.911">to follow through on key campaign</text>
  <text start="782.899" dur="9.211">promises Trump himself confirmed that</text>
  <text start="787.37" dur="7.04">the US markets could face some pain from</text>
  <text start="792.11" dur="6.289">the trade standoff with China and other</text>
  <text start="794.41" dur="7.09">countries but he said in the long run</text>
  <text start="798.399" dur="7.721">Americas Americans would be better off</text>
  <text start="801.5" dur="7.019">due to his protectionist actions he said</text>
  <text start="806.12" dur="4.86">I&amp;#39;m not saying there won&amp;#39;t be a little</text>
  <text start="808.519" dur="4.05">pain so we might lose a little of it but</text>
  <text start="810.98" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re going to have a much stronger</text>
  <text start="812.569" dur="6.171">country when we&amp;#39;re finished and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="815.75" dur="6.72">what I&amp;#39;m all about and he went on to say</text>
  <text start="818.74" dur="8.05">we have to do things that other people</text>
  <text start="822.47" dur="6.69">wouldn&amp;#39;t do it&amp;#39;s something we had to do</text>
  <text start="826.79" dur="5.729">and ultimately if you take a look it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="829.16" dur="5.909">not only trade with China it&amp;#39;s everybody</text>
  <text start="832.519" dur="5.641">but in the end we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="835.069" dur="6.411">stronger what he&amp;#39;s doing right now is</text>
  <text start="838.16" dur="7.32">he&amp;#39;s laying the groundwork the narrative</text>
  <text start="841.48" dur="5.74">for the economic collapse he&amp;#39;s taking</text>
  <text start="845.48" dur="4.62">this to the next level</text>
  <text start="847.22" dur="5.7">he&amp;#39;s letting people know there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="850.1" dur="4.84">to be some pain but in the long run and</text>
  <text start="852.92" dur="4.87">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean like next month</text>
  <text start="854.94" dur="5.94">in the long run we are setting</text>
  <text start="857.79" dur="8.1">everything up so the country will be</text>
  <text start="860.88" dur="8.37">better off we have now moved to the next</text>
  <text start="865.89" dur="5.16">level he&amp;#39;s taking control of the</text>
  <text start="869.25" dur="3.54">narrative it doesn&amp;#39;t mean the central</text>
  <text start="871.05" dur="4.26">bank is not going to try to fight back</text>
  <text start="872.79" dur="6.36">and take the narrative away from him</text>
  <text start="875.31" dur="6.96">this is a fight to the end and the</text>
  <text start="879.15" dur="6.54">central bank well they play dirty the</text>
  <text start="882.27" dur="6.3">deep state they play dirty and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="885.69" dur="5.22">gonna go through a transition and when</text>
  <text start="888.57" dur="6.51">we go through this transition there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="890.91" dur="5.31">going to be pain and people are gonna</text>
  <text start="895.08" dur="3.96">need to be prepared</text>
  <text start="896.22" dur="4.83">I would suggest having cash on hand this</text>
  <text start="899.04" dur="4.89">is what I&amp;#39;m doing I would have some gold</text>
  <text start="901.05" dur="5.7">and silver I would understand the crypto</text>
  <text start="903.93" dur="6.84">market so you understand how to trade</text>
  <text start="906.75" dur="6.36">cryptocurrency why do you need to know</text>
  <text start="910.77" dur="4.56">how to trade cryptocurrency it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="913.11" dur="4.08">thing to know to get in and out as we go</text>
  <text start="915.33" dur="5.55">through this transition because you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="917.19" dur="6.12">be able to make gains during this point</text>
  <text start="920.88" dur="3.84">in time because we&amp;#39;re gonna see you know</text>
  <text start="923.31" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of fluctuation and</text>
  <text start="924.72" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;ll allow you to trade out of</text>
  <text start="926.97" dur="4.29">different currencies with different news</text>
  <text start="929.13" dur="3.72">that is coming out now I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="931.26" dur="3.81">put everything into cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="932.85" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s what I wouldn&amp;#39;t do you diversify</text>
  <text start="935.07" dur="2.91">just like you gonna have a little bit in</text>

  <text start="942.12" dur="4.89">your wealth and cryptocurrency because</text>
  <text start="945.09" dur="3.03">eventually this most likely is going to</text>
