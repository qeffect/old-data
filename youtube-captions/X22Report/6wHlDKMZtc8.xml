  <text start="100.7" dur="5.49">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="103.88" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the entire economy</text>
  <text start="106.19" dur="4.89">in each sector on how each one is</text>
  <text start="108.71" dur="4.95">contracting and we&amp;#39;ve been watching this</text>
  <text start="111.08" dur="5.039">for a very long time and as we move</text>
  <text start="113.66" dur="4.56">forward throughout this year and as we</text>
  <text start="116.119" dur="4.381">keep going we can see that contraction</text>
  <text start="118.22" dur="2.7">continually happens it&amp;#39;s not slowing</text>
  <text start="120.5" dur="2.61">down</text>
  <text start="120.92" dur="3.6">things aren&amp;#39;t reversing and all of a</text>
  <text start="123.11" dur="4.23">sudden everything is getting better and</text>
  <text start="124.52" dur="4.499">we can see that retail sales they are</text>
  <text start="127.34" dur="3.45">continually contracting I mean we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="129.019" dur="2.94">been noting that there are many stores</text>
  <text start="130.79" dur="3.12">that are closing many going into</text>
  <text start="131.959" dur="3.301">bankruptcy and the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="3.93">out there trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="135.26" dur="5.34">online sales that is the reason for most</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="4.47">of what we&amp;#39;re seeing today is that the</text>
  <text start="140.6" dur="3.51">brick-and-mortar stores well no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="142.31" dur="5.55">going out to shop they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="144.11" dur="5.84">everything online and we knew for a very</text>
  <text start="147.86" dur="4.98">long time this was a complete lie so</text>
  <text start="149.95" dur="5.289">what we are seeing is that the corporate</text>
  <text start="152.84" dur="4.53">media is trying to explain away why this</text>
  <text start="155.239" dur="6.421">is happening now coming out of visual</text>
  <text start="157.37" dur="7.2">capitalist Jeff des jardins he notes</text>
  <text start="161.66" dur="5.43">back in 2000 less than 1% of retail</text>
  <text start="164.57" dur="5.16">sales came from the e-commerce sector</text>
  <text start="167.09" dur="4.2">however online sales well as we know</text>
  <text start="169.73" dur="3.36">they have climbed each and every year</text>
  <text start="171.29" dur="4.79">since then even though the Great</text>
  <text start="173.09" dur="6.209">Recession had occurred now in 2009</text>
  <text start="176.08" dur="6.52">ecommerce made up around 4 percent of</text>
  <text start="179.299" dur="6.901">total retail sales and today which is</text>
  <text start="182.6" dur="7.95">the latest number it is made up of 8.3</text>
  <text start="186.2" dur="6.06">and of total retail sales so when the</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="3.63">corporate media is out there giving us</text>
  <text start="192.26" dur="4.41">figures like oh three billion and read</text>
  <text start="194.18" dur="4.08">in the online sales it&amp;#39;s doing fantastic</text>
  <text start="196.67" dur="3.959">it&amp;#39;s taking over from brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="6.03">we can see that&amp;#39;s completely fake phony</text>
  <text start="200.629" dur="6.991">and false once again now we are seeing a</text>
  <text start="204.29" dur="6.449">huge number of bankruptcies right now</text>
  <text start="207.62" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re not even one third through 2017</text>
  <text start="210.739" dur="5.64">and we already have about as many retail</text>
  <text start="213.86" dur="5.25">bankruptcies as the previous year&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.379" dur="5.341">total now if they continue at the</text>
  <text start="219.11" dur="5.79">current pace we could see over 50</text>
  <text start="221.72" dur="5.879">retailers bankrupt by the end of this</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="5.339">year and we know with the store closing</text>
  <text start="227.599" dur="5.161">so for all we&amp;#39;ve seen around 3,000 store</text>
  <text start="230.239" dur="4.171">closing announced in 2017 and like we</text>
  <text start="232.76" dur="3.839">said before credit Swiss they projected</text>
  <text start="234.41" dur="4.95">this out and they&amp;#39;re looking at anywhere</text>
  <text start="236.599" dur="4.621">between seven thousand to eighty six</text>
  <text start="239.36" dur="4.29">hundred stores being closed by the end</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="4.22">of this year and we can see that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.65" dur="4.41">a lot of stores that are closing and</text>
  <text start="245.44" dur="5.829">some of them limited Wet Seal Eastern</text>
  <text start="248.06" dur="6.209">Outfitters BCBG HH Gregg these also</text>
  <text start="251.269" dur="5.34">stores that declared bankruptcy pay less</text>
  <text start="254.269" dur="4.111">and we can see when you go throughout</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="3.63">the mall you can see that these stores</text>
  <text start="258.38" dur="4.92">are completely going out of business and</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="6.93">what this tells us is that the American</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="5.76">person they do not have extra funds to</text>
  <text start="267.169" dur="4.111">go out and spend no they are not</text>
  <text start="269.06" dur="3.69">spending this online whatsoever because</text>
  <text start="271.28" dur="5.4">that&amp;#39;s only eight point three percent of</text>
  <text start="272.75" dur="5.97">total retail sales what it really means</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="4.02">and it&amp;#39;s not the weather has nothing to</text>
  <text start="278.72" dur="5.52">do with what&amp;#39;s going on in the universe</text>
  <text start="280.7" dur="5.25">it is because people just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="284.24" dur="3.6">funds to go out shopping and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="285.95" dur="4.38">saying this for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="5.82">when we look at the actual facts and the</text>
  <text start="290.33" dur="5.97">data and the actual numbers we do have</text>
  <text start="293.66" dur="5.6">proof that this is why this is happening</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="5.28">so then we have to think to ourselves if</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="4.629">retail sales are continually declining</text>
  <text start="301.58" dur="4.32">and we know that it&amp;#39;s not because of</text>
  <text start="303.889" dur="4.351">online sales of why brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="305.9" dur="4.65">stores are declining we have to think</text>
  <text start="308.24" dur="3.989">well is the unemployment numbers or</text>
  <text start="310.55" dur="3.54">these real I mean they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="312.229" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re down to 4.4 percent we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="314.09" dur="4.92">full employment right now and since</text>
  <text start="316.729" dur="3.301">everyone has a job why aren&amp;#39;t they going</text>
  <text start="319.01" dur="3.72">out to retail</text>
  <text start="320.03" dur="4.05">spend this money well we know because</text>
  <text start="322.73" dur="4.85">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the numbers</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="6.5">that this is not true but the Fed is</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="6.22">using the unemployment numbers right now</text>
  <text start="330.58" dur="5.68">to say yes we are going to raise</text>
  <text start="333.8" dur="4.68">interest rates now remember we just had</text>
  <text start="336.26" dur="3.42">our GDP numbers at 0.7 percent now most</text>
  <text start="338.48" dur="4.32">likely they&amp;#39;re going to manipulate these</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="5.43">GDP numbers coming up in the next round</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="4.95">the second quarter to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="345.11" dur="3.78">that yes it is now time to raise</text>
  <text start="347.75" dur="2.28">interest rates I think they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="348.89" dur="2.64">raise them before those numbers even</text>
  <text start="350.03" dur="3.36">come out they&amp;#39;re going to show the</text>
  <text start="351.53" dur="4.56">estimate numbers saying oh it&amp;#39;s around</text>
  <text start="353.39" dur="5.09">2% 1% we&amp;#39;re full employment let&amp;#39;s raise</text>
  <text start="356.09" dur="5.37">interest rates we already get word from</text>
  <text start="358.48" dur="5.35">John Williams who&amp;#39;s the San Francisco</text>
  <text start="361.46" dur="5.1">Fed President and he stands by his</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="5.25">outlook saying listen we are still going</text>
  <text start="366.56" dur="5.57">to do three to four hikes this year we</text>
  <text start="369.08" dur="7.14">are beyond full employment right now and</text>
  <text start="372.13" dur="7.06">the economy is operating above its</text>
  <text start="376.22" dur="6.09">potential right now that&amp;#39;s how great the</text>
  <text start="379.19" dur="5.7">economy is so there is absolutely no</text>
  <text start="382.31" dur="5.31">reason why we shouldn&amp;#39;t be raising the</text>
  <text start="384.89" dur="4.17">rates in June now think about what</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re saying right now they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="389.06" dur="4.23">at the manipulated unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="391.1" dur="4.29">trying to convince us that everything is</text>
  <text start="393.29" dur="4.77">fine in this economy even though there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.39" dur="5.16">a projective of 86 hundred stores that</text>
  <text start="398.06" dur="4.32">are going to be closed this year 3,500</text>
  <text start="400.55" dur="5.01">are already closed we&amp;#39;re going to hit</text>
  <text start="402.38" dur="5.16">around 50 bankruptcies and all these</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="4.02">individuals are losing their jobs but</text>
  <text start="407.54" dur="3.71">again it&amp;#39;s manipulated they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="4.14">counted in the unemployment numbers and</text>
  <text start="411.25" dur="5.26">we know why they&amp;#39;re doing this because</text>
  <text start="413.72" dur="4.86">they realize that they cannot support</text>
  <text start="416.51" dur="6.21">the system the way it is right now now</text>
  <text start="418.58" dur="6.21">how do we know this well two weeks ago</text>
  <text start="422.72" dur="3.66">Bank of America caused a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="424.79" dur="4.14">stir but the corporate media really</text>
  <text start="426.38" dur="5.12">didn&amp;#39;t publish this because it really</text>
  <text start="428.93" dur="5.07">wasn&amp;#39;t news and what they did is they</text>
  <text start="431.5" dur="5.5">calculated that the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434" dur="6">mostly the ECB Bank of Japan and we know</text>
  <text start="437" dur="5.28">the Fed well they control most of this</text>
  <text start="440" dur="5.07">where they&amp;#39;re feeding them a lot of this</text>
  <text start="442.28" dur="6.06">free money they&amp;#39;ve bought about one</text>
  <text start="445.07" dur="7.17">trillion of financial assets just in the</text>
  <text start="448.34" dur="5.46">first four months of 2017 which amounts</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="4.62">to 3.6</text>
  <text start="453.8" dur="6.06">million annualized this is the largest</text>
  <text start="456.86" dur="5.25">central bank buying on record</text>
  <text start="459.86" dur="5.399">what are they purchasing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.11" dur="5.489">purchasing stocks now Bank of America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="465.259" dur="4.081">Michael Hartnett noted that the</text>
  <text start="467.599" dur="4.38">super-sized central bank intervention</text>
  <text start="469.34" dur="5.729">which he dubbed liquidity supernova is</text>
  <text start="471.979" dur="6">the best explanation why global stocks</text>
  <text start="475.069" dur="5.551">and bonds both analyzing double-digit</text>
  <text start="477.979" dur="5.731">gains year-to-date and this really has</text>
  <text start="480.62" dur="6.75">nothing to do with Trump lepen China</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="6.959">it&amp;#39;s the central banks that are propping</text>
  <text start="487.37" dur="6.66">the stock market up now if we go back in</text>
  <text start="490.669" dur="6.24">time back to October 2014 City Matt</text>
  <text start="494.03" dur="5.28">Kingsley thanks Matt King calculated</text>
  <text start="496.909" dur="6.361">that it costs the central banks two</text>
  <text start="499.31" dur="7.259">hundred billion per quarter to avoid a</text>
  <text start="503.27" dur="4.769">market crash where as he put it it takes</text>
  <text start="506.569" dur="3.38">around two hundred billion per quarter</text>
  <text start="508.039" dur="4.8">just to keep markets from selling off</text>
  <text start="509.949" dur="4.9">now the Swiss National Bank</text>
  <text start="512.839" dur="4.14">well they purchased a record seventeen</text>
  <text start="514.849" dur="4.56">billion in US equities in just the first</text>

  <text start="526.7" dur="4.47">the first three months of this year and</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="5.17">when we look at this we can see that on</text>
  <text start="531.17" dur="5.37">the surface these sums appear vast</text>
  <text start="533.36" dur="5.669">however in the latest weekly report by</text>
  <text start="536.54" dur="8.31">Deutsche Bank credit strategist Dominic</text>
  <text start="539.029" dur="8.31">constan well he find that something is</text>
  <text start="544.85" dur="5.82">even more troubling than what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="547.339" dur="5.971">talking about one trillion in central</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="6.479">bank liquidity year today or roughly 250</text>
  <text start="553.31" dur="7.08">billion per month is not enough the</text>
  <text start="557.149" dur="5.521">reason is twofold on one hand there is</text>
  <text start="560.39" dur="4.199">the stock of existing central bank</text>
  <text start="562.67" dur="3.93">assets that keep growing at an</text>
  <text start="564.589" dur="4.531">exponential pace which implies that the</text>
  <text start="566.6" dur="5.28">central banks have to monetize even more</text>
  <text start="569.12" dur="5.79">assets just to keep the system from</text>
  <text start="571.88" dur="5.25">becoming unstable or collapsing so what</text>
  <text start="574.91" dur="5.19">does this mean for the central bank it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="577.13" dur="4.459">either they have to up their game which</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="3.66">is going to be very difficult because</text>
  <text start="581.589" dur="3.551">what&amp;#39;s going to happen in the stock</text>
  <text start="583.76" dur="4.17">market which we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="585.14" dur="6.25">that insiders are getting</text>
  <text start="587.93" dur="4.93">retail investors are coming into the</text>
  <text start="591.39" dur="4.05">market and there&amp;#39;s a reason for this</text>
  <text start="592.86" dur="4.62">because the central banks realize and</text>
  <text start="595.44" dur="4.23">understand that they&amp;#39;re pumping so much</text>
  <text start="597.48" dur="4.59">into the market right now that they</text>
  <text start="599.67" dur="5.97">can&amp;#39;t keep this up anymore because it</text>
  <text start="602.07" dur="6.3">won&amp;#39;t matter and when stocks realize</text>
  <text start="605.64" dur="4.47">just how insufficient the record 1</text>
  <text start="608.37" dur="4.26">trillion in central bank liquidity has</text>
  <text start="610.11" dur="4.29">become central banks which have stepped</text>
  <text start="612.63" dur="4.73">into every single market correction over</text>
  <text start="614.4" dur="6.36">the past seven years with some liquidity</text>

  <text start="623.37" dur="5.61">tools completely something that Janet</text>
  <text start="626.22" dur="5.31">Yellen and the rest know this is why</text>
  <text start="628.98" dur="5.79">they need to raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="631.53" dur="5.79">this is why they need to collapse the</text>
  <text start="634.77" dur="6.3">economy because they understand and they</text>
  <text start="637.32" dur="6.51">realize that they brought the system to</text>
  <text start="641.07" dur="6.27">the point where they can&amp;#39;t push it any</text>
  <text start="643.83" dur="6.45">longer and they don&amp;#39;t want the crash to</text>
  <text start="647.34" dur="5.13">come from a Black Swan type of an event</text>
  <text start="650.28" dur="4.32">they want to cause it because they want</text>
