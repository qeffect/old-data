  <text start="117.26" dur="4.99">there will be no stopping it whatsoever</text>
  <text start="119.7" dur="5.279">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is we know</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="4.68">the petrodollar system is at the heart</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="4.26">of this system remember we came off the</text>
  <text start="126.93" dur="3.9">gold standard back in the 70s and they</text>
  <text start="129.239" dur="3.451">put us on to this petrodollar system</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="3">which is hooked to oil where countries</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="3.45">in the Middle East they have to sell</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="4.29">their oil using the dollar and allow</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="3.33">other countries to take the dollar put</text>
  <text start="138.12" dur="4.38">it in their reserve so they can buy the</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="4.71">oil now Saudi Arabia they were the</text>
  <text start="142.5" dur="3.269">center of this deal and then you have</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="3.059">you know the offshoots like Libya</text>
  <text start="145.769" dur="4.921">Lebanon and things like that but Saudi</text>
  <text start="147.239" dur="9.901">Arabia they were the main focus and we</text>
  <text start="150.69" dur="8.7">know that they control OPEC and it was</text>
  <text start="157.14" dur="6.329">put together to control the other</text>
  <text start="159.39" dur="6.04">nations and all of this was done to prop</text>
  <text start="163.469" dur="3.52">up the dollar</text>
  <text start="165.43" dur="4.5">but what&amp;#39;s a very interesting right now</text>
  <text start="166.989" dur="6.541">is that Saudi Arabia they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="169.93" dur="4.71">about doing away with OPEC remember</text>
  <text start="173.53" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;ve been making deals with Russia</text>
  <text start="174.64" dur="5.67">making deals with China and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="177.25" dur="6.959">talking about getting rid of OPEC</text>
  <text start="180.31" dur="6.929">altogether which tells us that something</text>
  <text start="184.209" dur="6.081">big is about to happen with the petro</text>
  <text start="187.239" dur="5.58">dollar they&amp;#39;re already making plans to</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="4.39">go in a different direction we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="192.819" dur="3.06">about that in just a moment but I want</text>
  <text start="194.68" dur="3.959">to talk about what is happening around</text>
  <text start="195.879" dur="6.631">the world right now out in the UK we see</text>
  <text start="198.639" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of closures a lot</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="4.979">of the retail stores that they are</text>
  <text start="203.799" dur="6">closing down on the British High Street</text>
  <text start="207.489" dur="4.17">they suffer they suffered about two</text>
  <text start="209.799" dur="4.461">thousand six hundred ninety two store</text>
  <text start="211.659" dur="4.95">closures in the first half of 2018 and</text>
  <text start="214.26" dur="3.64">yes there are stores that are opening up</text>
  <text start="216.609" dur="1.8">but the amount of stores that are</text>
  <text start="217.9" dur="3.119">closing</text>
  <text start="218.409" dur="4.89">well that is much much higher than the</text>
  <text start="221.019" dur="3.87">stores that are actually opening we also</text>
  <text start="223.299" dur="4.44">see in the United States the same thing</text>
  <text start="224.889" dur="6.901">is happening a lot of stores are closing</text>
  <text start="227.739" dur="6.03">now in the UK 10% of the store closures</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="3.33">were finished and retailers and what</text>
  <text start="233.769" dur="4.291">they&amp;#39;re trying to say is that people</text>
  <text start="235.12" dur="4.44">rather buy their clothes online then go</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="3.569">to the store try them on make sure they</text>
  <text start="239.56" dur="3.78">fit and then purchase them which is kind</text>
  <text start="241.629" dur="4.021">of strange because if they don&amp;#39;t fit</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="5.22">you&amp;#39;re just paying postage back and</text>
  <text start="245.65" dur="5.91">forth and it takes forever so that</text>
  <text start="248.56" dur="5.569">really doesn&amp;#39;t make that much sense yes</text>
  <text start="251.56" dur="4.919">I know that people do it but overall</text>
  <text start="254.129" dur="3.73">people like to go to the store they like</text>
  <text start="256.479" dur="3.51">to try on the clothes like the try on</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="4.441">shoes see how they feel and if they feel</text>
  <text start="259.989" dur="4.8">good that&amp;#39;s when they purchase it the</text>
  <text start="262.3" dur="4.14">United States same thing the u.s. mall</text>
  <text start="264.789" dur="4.021">vacancies they&amp;#39;re at they&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="266.44" dur="5.27">six-year high right now in the first</text>
  <text start="268.81" dur="6.389">quarter of 2018 a lot of retail space</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="5.29">opening up here and then if we look at</text>
  <text start="275.199" dur="4.621">the image we see and this is the</text>
  <text start="277" dur="5.639">University Michigan sentiment gauge we</text>
  <text start="279.82" dur="6.42">see that it is declined</text>
  <text start="282.639" dur="6.451">now people thought the economy was</text>
  <text start="286.24" dur="6.09">getting better expectations right now</text>
  <text start="289.09" dur="6.21">they are slipping and if we look at the</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="6.059">buying expectations they slip lower</text>
  <text start="295.3" dur="3.76">across homes autos this is the lowest</text>
  <text start="298.389" dur="4.271">since 20</text>
  <text start="299.06" dur="5.609">13 with major appliances this is also</text>
  <text start="302.66" dur="4.02">slip so people are looking at this thing</text>
  <text start="304.669" dur="5.401">you know what we&amp;#39;re not gonna do any of</text>
  <text start="306.68" dur="6">this right now we&amp;#39;re holding off again</text>
  <text start="310.07" dur="5.55">why is this happening well the Fed is</text>
  <text start="312.68" dur="4.26">raising rates as you raise rates guess</text>
  <text start="315.62" dur="3.9">what happens everything becomes very</text>
  <text start="316.94" dur="3.78">very expensive pushes people out of the</text>
  <text start="319.52" dur="3.09">markets pushes people out of the</text>
  <text start="320.72" dur="3.15">automobile market pushes people out of</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="5.9">the student loan market pushes people</text>
  <text start="323.87" dur="7.08">out of the home market the credit cards</text>
  <text start="328.51" dur="4.78">they the interest rates are gonna go up</text>
  <text start="330.95" dur="4.71">there and people gonna have a tougher</text>
  <text start="333.29" dur="5.46">time paying those back it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="335.66" dur="4.5">connected and it&amp;#39;s all starting to fall</text>
  <text start="338.75" dur="3.419">apart and people starting to realize</text>
  <text start="340.16" dur="4.08">this now remember the Fed right now they</text>
  <text start="342.169" dur="3.421">think the economy is doing fantastically</text>
  <text start="344.24" dur="3.5">now of course this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="345.59" dur="5.01">we know the numbers are manipulated and</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="5.83">they&amp;#39;re gonna stay on track they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.6" dur="4.65">looking to raise the rate in December</text>
  <text start="353.57" dur="4.62">it looks like it&amp;#39;s baked in the cake</text>
  <text start="355.25" dur="5.81">right now for December then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.19" dur="6.06">going to raise the rates in 2019 and</text>
  <text start="361.06" dur="6.1">they&amp;#39;re talking about a couple more</text>
  <text start="364.25" dur="5.49">times maybe three more and we know once</text>
  <text start="367.16" dur="4.53">we hit that magic number which is gonna</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="5.31">be around mid 2019 which is gonna be</text>
  <text start="371.69" dur="5.28">around 3% well that&amp;#39;s when things are</text>
  <text start="375.05" dur="3.66">start are going to start to really</text>
  <text start="376.97" dur="2.97">really fall apart now we&amp;#39;re gonna see it</text>
  <text start="378.71" dur="3.57">fall apart all the way up to that point</text>
  <text start="379.94" dur="4.229">but this is going to be the tipping</text>
  <text start="382.28" dur="3.75">point when the economy starts to</text>
  <text start="384.169" dur="5.641">deteriorate very very quickly we saw</text>
  <text start="386.03" dur="5.58">this back in 2006 going into 2007 they</text>
  <text start="389.81" dur="3.45">hit a tipping point and they just boom</text>
  <text start="391.61" dur="4.47">they just dropped the interest rates and</text>
  <text start="393.26" dur="4.86">the whole entire system started to fall</text>
  <text start="396.08" dur="3.78">apart and it really accelerated in the</text>
  <text start="398.12" dur="3.06">year of 2008 and that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="399.86" dur="2.82">corporations they couldn&amp;#39;t even make it</text>
  <text start="401.18" dur="2.79">the housing market arted falling apart</text>
  <text start="402.68" dur="3.54">the stock market came down and</text>
  <text start="403.97" dur="3.96">everything just imploded but again at</text>
  <text start="406.22" dur="3.66">that time I believe the central bank did</text>
  <text start="407.93" dur="5.64">this on purpose because they wanted to</text>
  <text start="409.88" dur="5.67">start the next phase of their system and</text>
  <text start="413.57" dur="5.01">what was the next phase well the next</text>
  <text start="415.55" dur="5.61">phase was to allow them to create as</text>
  <text start="418.58" dur="4.44">much currency as possible because if</text>
  <text start="421.16" dur="3.45">they were not allowed to do this and</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="3.03">they weren&amp;#39;t allowed to bail out all</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="3.36">these different businesses and the stock</text>
  <text start="426.05" dur="4.41">mark and and the banks and things like</text>
  <text start="427.97" dur="4.47">that everything would have just imploded</text>
  <text start="430.46" dur="4.71">and what they needed to do</text>
  <text start="432.44" dur="5.79">was they needed to control the entire</text>
  <text start="435.17" dur="6.09">globe and they this allowed them to</text>
  <text start="438.23" dur="5.88">create as much currency as they needed</text>
  <text start="441.26" dur="5.34">and move it along around the world to</text>
  <text start="444.11" dur="4.5">put other things in place and they knew</text>
  <text start="446.6" dur="3.54">that this would only last a certain</text>
  <text start="448.61" dur="3.3">period of time before everything started</text>
  <text start="450.14" dur="4.89">to fall apart and they needed some more</text>
  <text start="451.91" dur="5.1">time before the event</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="4.05">this way they can explain away why the</text>
  <text start="457.01" dur="4.59">entire system is falling apart they</text>
  <text start="459.08" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t have that event right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.6" dur="4.23">running out of time and I do believe</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="3.36">that Powell right now with Trump they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="465.83" dur="3.33">working together</text>
  <text start="466.85" dur="5.19">remember Trump put Powell into this</text>
  <text start="469.16" dur="5.04">position he&amp;#39;s raising rates he knew he</text>
  <text start="472.04" dur="5.28">wasn&amp;#39;t he was not an easy money fed</text>
  <text start="474.2" dur="5.58">Trump is contradicting Powell blaming</text>
  <text start="477.32" dur="4.29">the Fed if the economy falls apart but</text>
  <text start="479.78" dur="3.69">this is just the beginning stages we</text>
  <text start="481.61" dur="3.06">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of moving pieces and</text>
  <text start="483.47" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that have to</text>
  <text start="484.67" dur="4.68">happen remember the central bank over</text>
  <text start="486.71" dur="5.73">time they set everything up go back to</text>
  <text start="489.35" dur="5.79">the 70s I mean everything&amp;#39;s intertwined</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="5.16">connected to the petrodollar the central</text>
  <text start="495.14" dur="5.1">bank has its hands in almost everything</text>
  <text start="497.6" dur="5.31">now but coming out of Saudi Arabia which</text>
  <text start="500.24" dur="4.62">is very very interesting and this is</text>
  <text start="502.91" dur="3.05">like groundbreaking news but no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="3.96">really talking about it</text>
  <text start="505.96" dur="5.05">Saudi Arabia&amp;#39;s top government funded</text>
  <text start="508.82" dur="4.74">think tank is said to be studying the</text>
  <text start="511.01" dur="8.49">possible effects on oil markets of</text>
  <text start="513.56" dur="7.8">breaking up OPEC the OPEC study aims to</text>
  <text start="519.5" dur="5.13">assess the short medium term</text>
  <text start="521.36" dur="6.9">consequences of a dissolution of OPEC</text>
  <text start="524.63" dur="5.76">what will happen if they get rid of OPEC</text>
  <text start="528.26" dur="5.55">and this revolves around the petro</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="5.4">dollar system officials are grappling</text>
  <text start="533.81" dur="4.32">with the assumption shared increasingly</text>
  <text start="535.79" dur="5.01">in the oil industry that oil demand will</text>
  <text start="538.13" dur="5.07">one day peak well really</text>
  <text start="540.8" dur="4.35">will it peak not too sure about that I</text>
  <text start="543.2" dur="3.75">think what really Saudi Arabia is doing</text>
  <text start="545.15" dur="4.92">along with other countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="546.95" dur="5.85">looking at China and Russia to basically</text>
  <text start="550.07" dur="5.61">pivot away from the west and move</text>
  <text start="552.8" dur="5.46">towards Russia and China and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="555.68" dur="4.71">been making a lot of deals and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.26" dur="4.47">trying to figure out a way to get out of</text>
  <text start="560.39" dur="3.75">the petro dollar system why do they want</text>
  <text start="562.73" dur="3.63">to get rid of the petro dollar system</text>
  <text start="564.14" dur="5.009">because they know it is a dead</text>
  <text start="566.36" dur="6.45">and it is coming to an end and they</text>
  <text start="569.149" dur="5.541">don&amp;#39;t want to be stuck in a system that</text>
  <text start="572.81" dur="7.5">is dead</text>
  <text start="574.69" dur="9.97">so they&amp;#39;re looking at this entire cartel</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="8.01">this OPEC cartel and they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="584.66" dur="7.109">make a move and the senior government</text>
  <text start="588.32" dur="5.55">officials they&amp;#39;ve started to question</text>
  <text start="591.769" dur="4.681">the longer-term rationale for the cartel</text>
  <text start="593.87" dur="7.409">because of a clout that Saudi Arabia and</text>
  <text start="596.45" dur="7.29">Russia alone can have on the markets so</text>
  <text start="601.279" dur="4.711">if Saudi Arabia moves away from the</text>
  <text start="603.74" dur="5.25">petrodollar system which they are at the</text>
  <text start="605.99" dur="6.18">center of it everything starts to fall</text>
  <text start="608.99" dur="5.57">apart I mean I believe there was a movie</text>
  <text start="612.17" dur="5.37">back in the 70 called roll over and</text>
  <text start="614.56" dur="4.54">Saudi Arabia they went ahead and they</text>
  <text start="617.54" dur="3">said listen we&amp;#39;re calling in our</text>
  <text start="619.1" dur="2.58">vestments we want everything and</text>
  <text start="620.54" dur="3.9">everything started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="621.68" dur="5.25">the same thing is gonna happen here it</text>
  <text start="624.44" dur="8.31">looks like that everything is being</text>
  <text start="626.93" dur="10.74">prepped to move away from the central</text>
  <text start="632.75" dur="6.69">bank Fiat system and countries are</text>
  <text start="637.67" dur="3.18">getting prepared to do this because we</text>
  <text start="639.44" dur="4.35">need to remember what is going on in the</text>
  <text start="640.85" dur="5.7">Middle East here if these Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="643.79" dur="5.159">countries and I&amp;#39;m saying if I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="646.55" dur="6.39">when when these Middle Eastern countries</text>
  <text start="648.949" dur="5.911">move away from the dollar and they say</text>
  <text start="652.94" dur="3.66">you know something countries that are</text>
  <text start="654.86" dur="4.979">out there right now you can use whatever</text>
  <text start="656.6" dur="5.52">currents you want to pay for oil you can</text>
  <text start="659.839" dur="4.86">use the dollar you can use the euro you</text>
  <text start="662.12" dur="4.56">can use gold you can use the ruble you</text>
  <text start="664.699" dur="3.901">can use the one we&amp;#39;ll take them all</text>
  <text start="666.68" dur="4.83">guess what countries are going to do</text>
  <text start="668.6" dur="7.02">most of them most likely will use their</text>
  <text start="671.51" dur="6.259">own currency or they might look at the</text>
  <text start="675.62" dur="4.589">yuan or ruble like Africa right now</text>
  <text start="677.769" dur="5.351">they&amp;#39;re saying why are we dealing in the</text>
  <text start="680.209" dur="4.231">dollar right now let&amp;#39;s deal in a</text>
  <text start="683.12" dur="2.76">different currency like that you want</text>
  <text start="684.44" dur="4.19">because we do a lot more business with</text>
  <text start="685.88" dur="5.97">China than we do with the United States</text>
  <text start="688.63" dur="7.269">now remember the dollar the US dollar is</text>
  <text start="691.85" dur="7.14">a central bank currency system it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="695.899" dur="4.201">the people&amp;#39;s money so if countries move</text>
  <text start="698.99" dur="4.05">away from it it</text>
  <text start="700.1" dur="5.13">the central bank the people yes we might</text>
  <text start="703.04" dur="4.14">feel a bump in the road might be hard at</text>
  <text start="705.23" dur="4.44">first but it will be better in the long</text>
  <text start="707.18" dur="4.44">run if we move away from the central</text>
  <text start="709.67" dur="5.25">bank currency and move on to a people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="711.62" dur="5.97">currency which we then control it this</text>
  <text start="714.92" dur="5.13">way we can create the currency just like</text>
  <text start="717.59" dur="5.7">the central bank but there&amp;#39;s no interest</text>
  <text start="720.05" dur="5.67">attached and that will have an effect on</text>
  <text start="723.29" dur="5.16">taxes that means we don&amp;#39;t need the IRS</text>
  <text start="725.72" dur="6.44">that means a lot of things will go away</text>
  <text start="728.45" dur="7.59">and everything will be reorganized and</text>
  <text start="732.16" dur="7.09">this is huge right now that Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="736.04" dur="5.07">is thinking about doing this when was</text>
  <text start="739.25" dur="3.24">the last time you heard Saudi Arabia say</text>
  <text start="741.11" dur="4.98">you know something we&amp;#39;re thinking about</text>
  <text start="742.49" dur="5.01">breaking up OPEC because it doesn&amp;#39;t seem</text>
  <text start="746.09" dur="3.51">like it&amp;#39;s something that we want to keep</text>
  <text start="747.5" dur="4.5">around because of Russia and China it</text>
  <text start="749.6" dur="4.29">looks like the outlook for Russia and</text>
  <text start="752" dur="4.38">China and Saudi Arabia linking together</text>
  <text start="753.89" dur="5.84">seems a lot better than dealing with the</text>
  <text start="756.38" dur="6.51">US I mean think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="759.73" dur="5.67">so we can see the plan is moving forward</text>
  <text start="762.89" dur="4.56">and it&amp;#39;s one little piece at a time</text>
  <text start="765.4" dur="3.67">start to put all these pieces together</text>
  <text start="767.45" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re starting to see a picture here a</text>
  <text start="769.07" dur="6.96">picture of a system without a central</text>
  <text start="772.01" dur="7.32">bank a picture of the central bank fiat</text>
  <text start="776.03" dur="7.17">system coming to an end and something</text>
  <text start="779.33" dur="7.14">else rising above it the plan is moving</text>
  <text start="783.2" dur="5.79">forward it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time and</text>
  <text start="786.47" dur="4.59">we can see time is ticking down right</text>
