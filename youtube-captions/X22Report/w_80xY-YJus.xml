  <text start="94.71" dur="5.64">narrative it is falling apart they were</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="5.24">making the case that the economy the</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="5.94">global economy is slow and because of</text>
  <text start="102.26" dur="6.1">Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs but we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="106.29" dur="3.09">find out that this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="4.29">with tariffs and we mentioned this</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="6.48">before but we can see that this happened</text>
  <text start="112.65" dur="6.15">once before where the world slowed and</text>
  <text start="115.86" dur="6">this was during the financial crisis and</text>
  <text start="118.8" dur="6.42">it slowed a lot more than its slowing</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="6.769">now actually it has been pumped up from</text>
  <text start="125.22" dur="5.879">2016 onward it&amp;#39;s slowing a little bit</text>
  <text start="128.629" dur="4.541">but if you go back to the financial</text>
  <text start="131.099" dur="5.851">crisis it was much much worse so that</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="6.84">narrative is falling apart and the plan</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="6.06">that the Patriots have put forth it is</text>
  <text start="140.01" dur="5.91">completely working think about what is</text>
  <text start="143.01" dur="5.369">happening right now the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.92" dur="5.01">plan of letting the world know that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.379" dur="5.281">Trump&amp;#39;s fault that the global economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.93" dur="4.169">falling apart that narrative is going to</text>
  <text start="153.66" dur="3.84">be pushed aside because there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="155.099" dur="4.411">be a deal in China tariffs eventually</text>
  <text start="157.5" dur="5.159">will be removed and that whole story</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="4.62">will complete be completely gone we see</text>
  <text start="162.659" dur="4.591">that the Fed</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="5.3">holding rates steady and most likely</text>
  <text start="167.25" dur="5.73">there are going to be lowering them and</text>
  <text start="169.43" dur="6.04">the central bank is completely exposed</text>
  <text start="172.98" dur="4.32">and they&amp;#39;re piling on more and more debt</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="4.62">countries have to continually borrow and</text>
  <text start="177.3" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s the central banks that are going to</text>
  <text start="180.09" dur="6.87">have the problem not Trump not the</text>
  <text start="183.63" dur="6.9">Patriots and the plan is working with</text>
  <text start="186.96" dur="6.06">deregulation with making deals and tax</text>
  <text start="190.53" dur="6.29">incentives bringing companies back to</text>
  <text start="193.02" dur="7.05">the US creating more jobs it is all</text>
  <text start="196.82" dur="6.46">happening and remember Trump has the</text>
  <text start="200.07" dur="6.09">magic wand let&amp;#39;s go out to the UK</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="5.04">because may was proposing to have her</text>
  <text start="206.16" dur="5.88">plan voted on once again for the fourth</text>
  <text start="208.32" dur="6.21">time but it looks like she&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="212.04" dur="4.56">abandon the plans to have it voted on</text>
  <text start="214.53" dur="4.29">because she&amp;#39;s not really gonna change it</text>
  <text start="216.6" dur="3.96">and the Parliament is looking at the</text>
  <text start="218.82" dur="4.02">same but woody what are we doing here</text>
  <text start="220.56" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re not going to vote on the same</text>
  <text start="222.84" dur="5.91">exact thing over and over and over and</text>
  <text start="225.24" dur="5.1">we see Nigel Farraj he confirmed his</text>
  <text start="228.75" dur="3.9">Briggs a party will take part in the</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="3.93">next general election and it looks like</text>
  <text start="232.65" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re trying to force to resume</text>
  <text start="234.27" dur="5.76">completely out of this remember this is</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="5.7">the --use plan it&amp;#39;s not the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="5.21">plan now here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="242.67" dur="6.6">see the US economy it is surged</text>
  <text start="245.24" dur="5.77">unexpectedly out of nowhere I mean they</text>
  <text start="249.27" dur="4.61">used to say this during Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="5.34">presidency the economy surged</text>
  <text start="253.88" dur="6.01">unexpectedly well that&amp;#39;s because of a</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="8.46">magic wand in the first quarter of 2019</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="9.35">we saw a 3.2 percent growth economists</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="8.03">predicted 2.5 percent much much higher</text>
  <text start="269.24" dur="6.25">the US economy was boosted by a</text>
  <text start="272.84" dur="6.07">shrinking trade gap</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="5.7">via The Wall Street Journal a factor</text>
  <text start="278.91" dur="4.65">that boosted growth was a shrinking</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="3.99">great trade gap the pace of American</text>
  <text start="283.56" dur="3.99">exports continued to rise in the first</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="4.98">quarter while the rate of imports fell</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="6.75">as Americans cut back on purchases of</text>
  <text start="290.16" dur="7.49">foreign goods evidently President Trump</text>
  <text start="294.3" dur="7.52">is winning the trade war Greg Abbott</text>

  <text start="320.69" dur="4.68">growth I guess the one percent Obama</text>
  <text start="323.09" dur="4.199">knew normal was really only because of</text>
  <text start="325.37" dur="4.38">his administration&amp;#39;s terrible policies</text>
  <text start="327.289" dur="5.971">ideas and job crushing regulations and</text>
  <text start="329.75" dur="5.15">Taxation voters take note now we need to</text>
  <text start="333.26" dur="5.31">go back in time to understand what</text>
  <text start="334.9" dur="6.45">Donald Trump juniors talking about the</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="5.54">new normal was during Obama&amp;#39;s presidency</text>
  <text start="341.35" dur="4.689">remember well the way we see in plumb</text>
  <text start="344.11" dur="2.4">unemployment right now that&amp;#39;s the new</text>
  <text start="346.039" dur="5.31">normal</text>
  <text start="346.51" dur="6.1">GDP between 1 and 1.75 percent that is</text>

  <text start="361.849" dur="5.221">no longer grow get used to it this is</text>
  <text start="364.789" dur="5.701">how it&amp;#39;s going to be they were</text>
  <text start="367.07" dur="6.24">brainwashing the American people they</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="6.12">are preparing the American people for a</text>
  <text start="373.31" dur="5.52">third world type of country this is why</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="4.32">they were pushing regulations this is</text>
  <text start="378.83" dur="4.29">why they were increasing taxes this is</text>
  <text start="380.93" dur="5.34">why they were doing everything they</text>
  <text start="383.12" dur="5.729">possibly could do to keep businesses out</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="6.03">of the United States because this was</text>
  <text start="388.849" dur="6.301">their major plan and now we see the</text>
  <text start="392.3" dur="5.489">opposite happening where all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="5.519">we don&amp;#39;t have the new normal anymore now</text>
  <text start="397.789" dur="5.581">we have growth yes this is manipulated</text>
  <text start="400.669" dur="5.761">it&amp;#39;s with the magic one Trump is using</text>
  <text start="403.37" dur="4.59">all their tools against them but if you</text>
  <text start="406.43" dur="4.019">notice the mainstream media they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="4.62">give him credit why well because we have</text>
  <text start="410.449" dur="5.25">the 2020 elections coming up if they</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="7.05">give him credit for the economy guess</text>
  <text start="415.699" dur="5.821">what people will look at this people</text>
  <text start="419.63" dur="4.68">will say wow look at the economy he gave</text>
  <text start="421.52" dur="5.399">us we no longer have that Obama economy</text>
  <text start="424.31" dur="4.59">we have the Trump economy and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.919" dur="5.011">roaring why would we want to go</text>
  <text start="428.9" dur="5.4">and this is why they&amp;#39;re being very very</text>
  <text start="431.93" dur="5.58">careful and plus they&amp;#39;re on the path</text>
  <text start="434.3" dur="4.589">that try to bring down the economy which</text>
  <text start="437.51" dur="3.3">is not going to happen because they</text>
  <text start="438.889" dur="2.851">completely lost control they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="440.81" dur="3.27">know that yet</text>
  <text start="441.74" dur="4.649">now the central bankers the IMF they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="444.08" dur="4.35">been telling us that global growth is</text>
  <text start="446.389" dur="4.021">slowing and it&amp;#39;s because of the tariffs</text>
  <text start="448.43" dur="3.66">has nothing to do with the central bank</text>
  <text start="450.41" dur="3.93">it has nothing to do with debt it has</text>
  <text start="452.09" dur="4.41">nothing to do with any of that except</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="4.74">for the tariffs now the merchandise</text>
  <text start="456.5" dur="7.35">world trade monitor they released a</text>
  <text start="459.08" dur="8.52">report and it says that the world trade</text>
  <text start="463.85" dur="6.75">volume is falling most since the</text>
  <text start="467.6" dur="6.12">financial crisis now keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="470.6" dur="6.3">it is down three point four percent from</text>
  <text start="473.72" dur="7.56">the peak in October and down 1.1 percent</text>
  <text start="476.9" dur="6.75">from February a year earlier now if we</text>
  <text start="481.28" dur="5.4">look at the world trade volume and we</text>
  <text start="483.65" dur="8.75">look at the index when Trump came into</text>
  <text start="486.68" dur="9.63">office in 2016 2017 the index was at 115</text>
  <text start="492.4" dur="10.36">the index reached right at the beginning</text>
  <text start="496.31" dur="8.49">of 2019 around 127 so we went from 115</text>
  <text start="502.76" dur="6.48">when he first came into office all the</text>
  <text start="504.8" dur="8.88">way up to 127 prior to that the index</text>
  <text start="509.24" dur="8.669">was at 105 back in 2011 and it made it</text>
  <text start="513.68" dur="4.77">up to 115 now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="517.909" dur="3.81">second</text>
  <text start="518.45" dur="6.87">so Trump has brought the world trade</text>
  <text start="521.719" dur="6.06">volume while he was president and this</text>
  <text start="525.32" dur="5.04">has moved up since he&amp;#39;s been in his</text>
  <text start="527.779" dur="6.631">presidency even when he introduced</text>
  <text start="530.36" dur="8.01">tariffs and if we go back in time we can</text>
  <text start="534.41" dur="6.98">see during 2008 2009 we&amp;#39;ve had many</text>
  <text start="538.37" dur="7.44">times where the world trade volume</text>
  <text start="541.39" dur="6.28">dipped and we&amp;#39;re seeing it dip once</text>
  <text start="545.81" dur="5.1">again and we haven&amp;#39;t seen a dip like</text>
  <text start="547.67" dur="7.56">this since the financial crisis remember</text>
  <text start="550.91" dur="7.62">that the financial crisis there were no</text>
  <text start="555.23" dur="6.6">tariffs it was the central bank what has</text>
  <text start="558.53" dur="5.58">changed right now we&amp;#39;ve added more debt</text>
  <text start="561.83" dur="5.52">the central bank system is coming to an</text>
  <text start="564.11" dur="5.43">end Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs they will be going</text>
  <text start="567.35" dur="5.13">away and we explained this before the</text>
  <text start="569.54" dur="5.609">tariffs have no impact on this actually</text>
  <text start="572.48" dur="4.89">if you look at the culprits if you look</text>
  <text start="575.149" dur="6.031">at which countries are involved and</text>
  <text start="577.37" dur="5.7">which ones are slowing well it looks</text>
  <text start="581.18" dur="4.2">like it&amp;#39;s imports and exports by China</text>
  <text start="583.07" dur="4.59">and the emerging Asian economies of Hong</text>
  <text start="585.38" dur="4.769">Kong India South Korea Indonesia</text>
  <text start="587.66" dur="5.79">Malaysia Taiwan Thailand Philippines</text>
  <text start="590.149" dur="5.851">Pakistan Singapore China is by far the</text>
  <text start="593.45" dur="5">largest economy in this emerging Asian</text>
  <text start="596" dur="5.7">by far the largest importer and exporter</text>
  <text start="598.45" dur="5.259">China is having the problem it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="601.7" dur="5.069">because of the tariffs has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="603.709" dur="5.701">with that exports by this economic leave</text>
  <text start="606.769" dur="4.5">a storm rapidly growing region fell by</text>
  <text start="609.41" dur="2.82">eight point three percent in February</text>
  <text start="611.269" dur="3.421">from a year earlier</text>
  <text start="612.23" dur="4.65">after having zigzag lower four months</text>
  <text start="614.69" dur="4.11">according to the world trade monitor the</text>
  <text start="616.88" dur="5.699">data is volatile with large</text>
  <text start="618.8" dur="6.12">month-to-month up and downs this is what</text>
  <text start="622.579" dur="4.171">the central banks are doing but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="624.92" dur="5.19">trying to turn it around and say that</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s the tariffs now you know that Trump</text>
  <text start="630.11" dur="4.02">is going to make a deal with China</text>
  <text start="631.94" dur="5.25">you know the tariffs are going to be</text>
  <text start="634.13" dur="6.66">removed and we&amp;#39;ve already showed that</text>
  <text start="637.19" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s the first middleman that purchased</text>
  <text start="640.79" dur="5.88">the product that gets hit with the</text>
  <text start="643.37" dur="6.33">percentage not the American people so if</text>
  <text start="646.67" dur="5.7">he places a 10 or 20 percent tariff on a</text>
  <text start="649.7" dur="4.86">product that&amp;#39;s coming in from China it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="652.37" dur="6.209">not like the price increases 10 to 20</text>
  <text start="654.56" dur="5.04">percent it increases maybe in pennies or</text>
  <text start="658.579" dur="3.541">not at all</text>
  <text start="659.6" dur="4.62">because it&amp;#39;s the first middleman in</text>
  <text start="662.12" dur="4.74">China that purchased that product that</text>
  <text start="664.22" dur="4.979">gets hit with the tariff so that</text>
  <text start="666.86" dur="4.589">individual that middleman will pay 10%</text>
  <text start="669.199" dur="4.411">but again there&amp;#39;s off caught there</text>
  <text start="671.449" dur="4.681">there&amp;#39;s cost that might counter this and</text>
  <text start="673.61" dur="5.46">most of the time the American people</text>
  <text start="676.13" dur="6.36">don&amp;#39;t even see it but it makes difficult</text>
  <text start="679.07" dur="5.37">for China and the middlemen there so</text>
  <text start="682.49" dur="4.83">this is not going to slow anything</text>
  <text start="684.44" dur="4.7">actually what is happening is the United</text>
  <text start="687.32" dur="5.3">States like we just said before we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="689.14" dur="5.86">exporting more and not taking in</text>
  <text start="692.62" dur="5.53">products he</text>
  <text start="695" dur="6.3">changing the dynamic and it has to be</text>
