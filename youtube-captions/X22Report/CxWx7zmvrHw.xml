  <text start="118.97" dur="8.61">going to be recession in the exact year</text>
  <text start="123.77" dur="6.599">that they&amp;#39;re all reporting I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.58" dur="5.49">not like one says oh in 2022 the other</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="6.18">one says 2021 they&amp;#39;re all saying the</text>
  <text start="133.07" dur="4.639">exact time period this is a coordinated</text>
  <text start="136.549" dur="3.77">effort</text>
  <text start="137.709" dur="5.551">they&amp;#39;re working together because they</text>
  <text start="140.319" dur="5.401">think they have control over the Fed</text>
  <text start="143.26" dur="5.46">they think the Fed is working with them</text>
  <text start="145.72" dur="6.21">but something happened today where it</text>
  <text start="148.72" dur="5.849">shows the Fed is not working with them</text>
  <text start="151.93" dur="4.47">the Fed is not on the same side and</text>
  <text start="154.569" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;ll be discussing that in a little bit</text>
  <text start="156.4" dur="4.729">but first let&amp;#39;s go out to the brexit</text>
  <text start="158.349" dur="5.071">here and it looks like the MPS right now</text>
  <text start="161.129" dur="4">they voted to limit the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="5.099">ability to use the threat of an Odile</text>
  <text start="165.129" dur="7.711">brexit to force the MPS into backing</text>
  <text start="168.519" dur="6.921">may&amp;#39;s deal so what was happening is the</text>
  <text start="172.84" dur="6.509">same thing that always happens the elite</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="7.09">they threaten the central banks they</text>
  <text start="179.349" dur="6">threaten you better do this or else this</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="4.349">is going to happen and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="185.349" dur="5.64">MPs voted to limit the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.879" dur="7.621">ability to use this type of threat may</text>
  <text start="190.989" dur="7.64">is in trouble right now and it looks</text>
  <text start="194.5" dur="6.75">like she might cave on concessions and</text>
  <text start="198.629" dur="5.051">do I think that this deal is going to</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="4.889">pass at this point I don&amp;#39;t think so and</text>
  <text start="203.68" dur="4.44">remember the EU they said listen this is</text>
  <text start="206.139" dur="5.1">the deal and if you don&amp;#39;t take this deal</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="5.22">there is no other deal and once again</text>
  <text start="211.239" dur="4.5">the central banks were threatening to</text>
  <text start="213.34" dur="5.479">shut down everything everything would</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="5.61">fall apart if you don&amp;#39;t take their deal</text>
  <text start="218.819" dur="4.38">now a couple people have been riding in</text>
  <text start="221.349" dur="4.35">and they said something very interesting</text>
  <text start="223.199" dur="3.82">that this might have been the brexit I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="225.699" dur="6.18">talking about might have been the</text>
  <text start="227.019" dur="7.56">beginning of the Patriot plan to bring</text>
  <text start="231.879" dur="6.03">down the central bank system now this</text>
  <text start="234.579" dur="5.851">could be where again people were voting</text>
  <text start="237.909" dur="4.32">to separate themselves from the central</text>
  <text start="240.43" dur="3.059">bank this is the beginning stages the</text>
  <text start="242.229" dur="2.91">central banks when they were having the</text>
  <text start="243.489" dur="3.18">votes saying yeah this is not going to</text>
  <text start="245.139" dur="2.16">work people really want to be with the</text>
  <text start="246.669" dur="3.121">EU</text>
  <text start="247.299" dur="5.011">they&amp;#39;ll never vote oh you know the</text>
  <text start="249.79" dur="6.3">country away from the EU and the whole</text>
  <text start="252.31" dur="6.539">thing backfired and at that time the EU</text>
  <text start="256.09" dur="4.889">was threatening saying that if you do</text>
  <text start="258.849" dur="4.231">this then the whole entire system is</text>
  <text start="260.979" dur="4.921">gonna fall apart which it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="8.08">this might be the beginning stages and</text>

  <text start="515.249" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re all saying the exact same thing</text>
  <text start="517.849" dur="5.56">now if we go back to 2008 when the</text>
  <text start="521.909" dur="3.511">mainstream media and the Fed were</text>
  <text start="523.409" dur="4.92">synched we didn&amp;#39;t have the mainstream</text>

  <text start="547.559" dur="4.59">around him laughing at him Bernanke at</text>
  <text start="550.68" dur="3.829">the time was saying that there was no</text>

  <text start="628.94" dur="3.06">wrong in the background and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="630.17" dur="5.63">there was something wrong way way back</text>
  <text start="632" dur="8.48">before the market came down but Powell</text>
  <text start="635.8" dur="9.12">he&amp;#39;s saying that he&amp;#39;s very worried about</text>
  <text start="640.48" dur="7.96">global growth slowing he thinks China</text>
  <text start="644.92" dur="5.22">has another year of solid growth and he</text>
  <text start="648.44" dur="5.46">even came out and said the following</text>
  <text start="650.14" dur="6.04">that if there is an extended shutdown it</text>
  <text start="653.9" dur="6.68">would have an impact on the economy that</text>
  <text start="656.18" dur="7.74">would show up in the data very clearly</text>
  <text start="660.58" dur="4.99">now we know that this is not going to</text>
