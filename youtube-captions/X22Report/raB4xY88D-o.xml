  <text start="70.97" dur="6.03">cyber attack coming soon let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="75.11" dur="4.619">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="77" dur="5.34">geopolitical news well it looks like the</text>
  <text start="79.729" dur="5.911">Cabal is not giving up with this Russian</text>
  <text start="82.34" dur="5.76">collusion that rusher cyber attacked the</text>
  <text start="85.64" dur="3.57">elections that they were involved Trump</text>
  <text start="88.1" dur="2.73">was involved and they&amp;#39;re just continuing</text>
  <text start="89.21" dur="3.72">with this they&amp;#39;re not letting up</text>
  <text start="90.83" dur="5.09">whatsoever and now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="92.93" dur="5.91">Facebook founder the CEO Mark Zuckerberg</text>
  <text start="95.92" dur="6.64">he was out there and he released to</text>
  <text start="98.84" dur="6.3">Congress all these different ads that</text>
  <text start="102.56" dur="5.01">were running during the u.s. 27 2016</text>
  <text start="105.14" dur="4.44">presidential election and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="107.57" dur="6.11">there&amp;#39;s about 3000 ads that were</text>
  <text start="109.58" dur="8.31">purchased between June 2015 and May 2017</text>
  <text start="113.68" dur="6.91">connected to 470 in authentic accounts</text>
  <text start="117.89" dur="5.04">and pages in violation of their policies</text>
  <text start="120.59" dur="3.66">and he said that you know our analysis</text>
  <text start="122.93" dur="3.33">suggests that these accounts and pages</text>
  <text start="124.25" dur="4.41">were affiliated with one another and</text>
  <text start="126.26" dur="5.009">likely operated out of Russia the</text>
  <text start="128.66" dur="4.82">problem is they have no proof they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="131.269" dur="5.991">know if it was Russia they have no idea</text>
  <text start="133.48" dur="8.02">where this all these ads came from and</text>
  <text start="137.26" dur="7.33">right now they&amp;#39;re just trying to push</text>
  <text start="141.5" dur="5.58">out there anything they can put their</text>
  <text start="144.59" dur="5.79">hands on to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="147.08" dur="5.52">Russia is still the enemy now put it</text>
  <text start="150.38" dur="4.95">this way if they&amp;#39;re running ads on</text>
  <text start="152.6" dur="6.12">Facebook you really think that this</text>
  <text start="155.33" dur="7.11">really turned the election all these ads</text>
  <text start="158.72" dur="5.94">I mean first they said Russia cyber</text>
  <text start="162.44" dur="4.98">attacked and they changed the election</text>
  <text start="164.66" dur="4.26">results now they have no proof of that</text>
  <text start="167.42" dur="3.75">whatsoever so they can&amp;#39;t use that</text>
  <text start="168.92" dur="4.17">anymore then they said you know Trump</text>
  <text start="171.17" dur="3.96">was involved with Russia with Russian</text>
  <text start="173.09" dur="4.399">collusion and they couldn&amp;#39;t prove that</text>
  <text start="175.13" dur="6.78">either because there was nothing there</text>
  <text start="177.489" dur="7.09">they have this special counsel in in the</text>
  <text start="181.91" dur="3.99">FBI still researching looking into</text>
  <text start="184.579" dur="2.071">everything they can&amp;#39;t find anything</text>
  <text start="185.9" dur="2.58">there I know there</text>
  <text start="186.65" dur="3.57">with all this different information but</text>
  <text start="188.48" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s really nothing there so far they</text>
  <text start="190.22" dur="3.719">can&amp;#39;t find anything and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="4.38">that all these ads are there this</text>
  <text start="193.939" dur="4.5">reminds me of like cyberattacks when</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="4.349">they&amp;#39;ll just come out and say well North</text>
  <text start="198.439" dur="5.431">Korea attacks Sony Pictures they had no</text>
  <text start="201.319" dur="3.29">proof and it turned out to be an inside</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="3.209">job</text>
  <text start="204.609" dur="5.681">Russia hacked this well they had no</text>
  <text start="207.079" dur="5.371">proof they just say it and they expect</text>
  <text start="210.29" dur="5.25">everyone just to believe it and the</text>
  <text start="212.45" dur="4.2">whole thing is completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="215.54" dur="5.55">false I mean Russia&amp;#39;s out there saying</text>
  <text start="216.65" dur="8.399">this is ridiculous and this is not going</text>
  <text start="221.09" dur="6.209">to change people&amp;#39;s minds the reason why</text>
  <text start="225.049" dur="5.25">people voted in a certain way is because</text>
  <text start="227.299" dur="6.181">they were unhappy with way the way the</text>
  <text start="230.299" dur="4.921">country was headed that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="233.48" dur="4.589">decided you know something we weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.22" dur="6.419">gonna go in this direction and the Cabal</text>
  <text start="238.069" dur="5.191">well they were trying to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="241.639" dur="4.44">election because you can see that</text>
  <text start="243.26" dur="5.339">Hillary did win the popular vote but the</text>
  <text start="246.079" dur="4.59">electoral college well that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="248.599" dur="4.53">Trump won and they thought if they got</text>
  <text start="250.669" dur="4.41">the popular vote the Electoral College</text>
  <text start="253.129" dur="4.591">was just follow through like they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="255.079" dur="6.331">done in the past and it didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="257.72" dur="6.629">this time and there was no cyber attack</text>
  <text start="261.41" dur="4.68">there was no Russian collusion none of</text>
  <text start="264.349" dur="3.361">this is true they&amp;#39;re just trying to do</text>
  <text start="266.09" dur="4.5">whatever they possibly can to convince</text>
  <text start="267.71" dur="5.07">everyone that yet this is still</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="3.69">happening Russia&amp;#39;s the enemy and this is</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="3.27">why Morgan Freeman is out there with the</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="4.35">advertisement they are doing their</text>
  <text start="276.05" dur="5.399">last-ditch effort to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="4.83">because this is all they have we see</text>
  <text start="281.449" dur="4.59">that the White House not they place more</text>
  <text start="283.46" dur="4.889">sanctions on North Korea and these</text>
  <text start="286.039" dur="4.531">include sanctions on any foreign</text>
  <text start="288.349" dur="4.651">financial institution that knowingly</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="4.849">conducts or facilitates any significant</text>
  <text start="293" dur="5.76">transaction on behalf of certain</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="6.131">individuals and entities and we can see</text>
  <text start="298.76" dur="5.58">that they&amp;#39;re trying to shut this whole</text>
  <text start="301.55" dur="5.82">thing down they&amp;#39;re trying to force North</text>
  <text start="304.34" dur="5.73">Korea into doing something and once</text>
  <text start="307.37" dur="4.95">again this is not going to work I mean</text>
  <text start="310.07" dur="4.14">they also targeted vessels that have</text>
  <text start="312.32" dur="3.27">engaged in a ship-to-ship transfer with</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="4.199">a vessel that has visited North Korea</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="4.68">within 180 days so they&amp;#39;re trying to say</text>
  <text start="318.409" dur="2.341">listen all these other countries stay</text>
  <text start="320.27" dur="2.43">away</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="3.45">or you&amp;#39;re gonna be saying it&amp;#39;s like the</text>
  <text start="322.7" dur="3.51">United States is the bully on the block</text>
  <text start="324.2" dur="3.9">which we know this is what has been</text>
  <text start="326.21" dur="4.14">happening for many many years and they</text>
  <text start="328.1" dur="4.49">are just pushing around these smaller</text>
  <text start="330.35" dur="5.88">countries and trying to force them</text>
  <text start="332.59" dur="6.13">forcing them into doing things that they</text>
  <text start="336.23" dur="5.07">really don&amp;#39;t want to do and North Korea</text>
  <text start="338.72" dur="5.22">right now is really not going to back</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="6.51">down we see that South Korea is doing</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="5.76">the actual opposite of what the United</text>
  <text start="347.81" dur="6.24">States wants now the United States wants</text>
  <text start="349.7" dur="6.08">sanctions and South Korea well they are</text>
  <text start="354.05" dur="4.26">going to give and they made this</text>
  <text start="355.78" dur="6.46">surprise decision that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="358.31" dur="6.36">send 8 million dollars of aid to North</text>
  <text start="362.24" dur="4.59">Korea the South said it planned to send</text>
  <text start="364.67" dur="4.31">about 4.5 million worth of medical</text>
  <text start="366.83" dur="4.35">treatments nursery facilities</text>
  <text start="368.98" dur="3.94">nutritional products for children and</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="5.64">pregnant women through the World Food</text>
  <text start="372.92" dur="6.51">Program and again this is going against</text>
  <text start="376.82" dur="4.35">the sanctions and the United States</text>
  <text start="379.43" dur="4.23">again once again it is not really happy</text>
  <text start="381.17" dur="6.69">about this remember behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="6.39">right now there are talks going on China</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="4.08">is involved Russia is involved yes the</text>
  <text start="390.05" dur="3.93">United States is mobbed and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.94" dur="3.69">trying to calm the situation down the</text>
  <text start="393.98" dur="3.57">Cabal on the other camp on the other</text>
  <text start="395.63" dur="4.92">hand the neocons on the other hand they</text>
  <text start="397.55" dur="4.68">want something to happen they want some</text>
  <text start="400.55" dur="3.75">type of war and I know we&amp;#39;ve had these</text>
  <text start="402.23" dur="3.57">couple of tests where they fired these</text>
  <text start="404.3" dur="2.97">missiles and they intercepted the</text>
  <text start="405.8" dur="3.36">missiles and we talked about this before</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="3.84">where they knew what the missile type</text>
  <text start="409.16" dur="3.84">was they knew the trajectory they knew</text>
  <text start="411.11" dur="3.93">exactly what was going to happen when it</text>
  <text start="413" dur="7.67">was going to be launched and according</text>
  <text start="415.04" dur="9.6">to this individual Joe Cirincione of</text>
  <text start="420.67" dur="7.42">Defense one he&amp;#39;s saying that we really</text>
  <text start="424.64" dur="6.6">aren&amp;#39;t capable of shooting down a North</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="6.81">Korean missile when the Japanese chief</text>
  <text start="431.24" dur="5.43">cabinet secretary said we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="434.9" dur="4.5">intercept it because no damage to</text>
  <text start="436.67" dur="5.76">Japanese territory was expected this was</text>
  <text start="439.4" dur="5.28">only partially true it wasn&amp;#39;t a threat</text>
  <text start="442.43" dur="4.04">but they didn&amp;#39;t have the capability to</text>
  <text start="444.68" dur="4.23">shoot it down due to the altitude</text>
  <text start="446.47" dur="4.69">neither Japan nor the United States</text>
  <text start="448.91" dur="4.14">could have intercepted the missile none</text>
  <text start="451.16" dur="2.849">of the theater ballistic missile defense</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="3.299">weapons in</text>
  <text start="454.009" dur="4.47">distance can reach that high it is</text>
  <text start="456.349" dur="4.5">hundreds of kilometers too high for the</text>
  <text start="458.479" dur="4.951">aegis interceptors deployed on Navy</text>
  <text start="460.849" dur="4.77">ships off Japan even higher for the</text>
  <text start="463.43" dur="4.68">THAAD systems in South Korea and Guam</text>
  <text start="465.619" dur="5.19">way too high for the patriot systems in</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="5.489">Japan which engage largely within the</text>
  <text start="470.809" dur="4.59">atmosphere all of these are basically</text>
  <text start="473.599" dur="4.831">designed to hit a missile in the post</text>
  <text start="475.399" dur="5.341">mid-course or terminal phase when it is</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="5.699">on its way down coming more or less</text>
  <text start="480.74" dur="5.609">straight at the defending system and if</text>
  <text start="484.129" dur="4.981">we have the ability to shoot down North</text>
  <text start="486.349" dur="6.54">Korean missiles why haven&amp;#39;t we done so</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="6.269">as of yet and the reason for this is we</text>
  <text start="492.889" dur="6">can&amp;#39;t and if we try to do it and we</text>
  <text start="495.379" dur="4.53">missed guess what Kim jong-un would use</text>
  <text start="498.889" dur="2.851">this to his advantage</text>
  <text start="499.909" dur="5.31">this is why the United States hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="501.74" dur="5.069">done this even though they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="505.219" dur="3.09">showing you they can shoot down a</text>
  <text start="506.809" dur="3.181">missile but they know all the</text>
  <text start="508.309" dur="3.931">information about the missile they know</text>
  <text start="509.99" dur="4.709">exactly how to shoot it down something</text>
  <text start="512.24" dur="5.19">from North Korea is going to be a little</text>
  <text start="514.699" dur="5.22">bit more difficult we see Iran right now</text>
  <text start="517.43" dur="4.919">they are making deals all over the place</text>
  <text start="519.919" dur="5.551">they made a deal with Denmark the Downs</text>
  <text start="522.349" dur="5.941">Bank they signed a 500 euro million</text>
  <text start="525.47" dur="5.04">finance contract and we can see that</text>
  <text start="528.29" dur="6.45">Denmark&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;s Bank is the second</text>
  <text start="530.51" dur="8.37">European lender to Inc such an agreement</text>
  <text start="534.74" dur="6.45">with Iran right now so sanctions and all</text>
  <text start="538.88" dur="6.259">these things it&amp;#39;s not helping China</text>
  <text start="541.19" dur="6.87">Russia Iran the rest of the countries</text>
  <text start="545.139" dur="5.32">they&amp;#39;re all making deals and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.06" dur="4.139">doing it outside of the dollar and we</text>
  <text start="550.459" dur="5.13">can see that they don&amp;#39;t care anymore</text>
  <text start="552.199" dur="6">and they&amp;#39;re doing this and pushing their</text>
  <text start="555.589" dur="4.321">economic systems forward even though the</text>
  <text start="558.199" dur="3.241">dollar is dying even though the United</text>
  <text start="559.91" dur="3.659">States doesn&amp;#39;t want this to happen even</text>
  <text start="561.44" dur="4.019">though the United States is trying to</text>
  <text start="563.569" dur="5.82">bully all these countries it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="565.459" dur="7.831">working anymore we see the Syrian Kurds</text>
  <text start="569.389" dur="5.971">they held a local vote they had</text>
  <text start="573.29" dur="3.599">elections right now the Syrian</text>
  <text start="575.36" dur="3.27">government is saying this is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="576.889" dur="4.171">but we can see that the cabal they are</text>
  <text start="578.63" dur="4.439">pushing their agenda they want to show</text>
  <text start="581.06" dur="4.23">that yes they&amp;#39;re having this referendum</text>
  <text start="583.069" dur="4.83">yes they are looking to vote themselves</text>
  <text start="585.29" dur="5.19">away from Syria and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="587.899" dur="5.101">push this idea but the rest of the</text>
  <text start="590.48" dur="5.969">country is really not going along with</text>
  <text start="593" dur="4.62">this now in Iraq we understand that the</text>
  <text start="596.449" dur="2.88">Iraqi government is saying listen</text>
  <text start="597.62" dur="3.98">there&amp;#39;s no going to be there&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="599.329" dur="4.49">to be an independent Kurd area and</text>
  <text start="601.6" dur="4.179">there&amp;#39;s supposed to be some type of</text>
  <text start="603.819" dur="2.981">referendum which is supposed to be held</text>
  <text start="605.779" dur="4.261">on September 25th</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="6.87">just like in Catalonia and we can see</text>
  <text start="610.04" dur="5.37">that there&amp;#39;s not as many Kurds that are</text>
  <text start="613.67" dur="4.169">there that are looking to become</text>
  <text start="615.41" dur="4.169">independent the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="617.839" dur="4.11">making it seem like this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.579" dur="5.61">happening but this is being pushed by</text>
  <text start="621.949" dur="6.361">the Cabal they want the Kurds to have a</text>
  <text start="625.189" dur="5.101">separate piece of land and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="628.31" dur="5.339">trying to connect this with Iraq and</text>
  <text start="630.29" dur="5.849">Syria and if they don&amp;#39;t get their way it</text>
  <text start="633.649" dur="4.771">looks like we might see some infighting</text>
  <text start="636.139" dur="5.7">and this is exactly what they want they</text>
  <text start="638.42" dur="6.57">want another war to break out against</text>
  <text start="641.839" dur="5.94">the Kurds and the government of these</text>
  <text start="644.99" dur="6.659">countries so we might see the Kurds rise</text>
  <text start="647.779" dur="5.731">up and start fighting against the Syrian</text>
  <text start="651.649" dur="3.93">government and the Iraqi government and</text>
  <text start="653.51" dur="5.49">it looks like they might just create</text>
  <text start="655.579" dur="5.31">chaos in the area we&amp;#39;re getting</text>

  <text start="756.95" dur="5.49">is the top and they&amp;#39;re saying if this</text>
  <text start="760.94" dur="2.97">does happen where I should say when</text>
  <text start="762.44" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re saying when this does happen</text>

  <text start="769.37" dur="5.04">response to this now we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="772.49" dur="3.87">this before and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="774.41" dur="4.26">preparing and they&amp;#39;re building up the</text>
  <text start="776.36" dur="4.56">propaganda that when this economic</text>
  <text start="778.67" dur="4.86">system starts to come down they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="780.92" dur="4.68">have multiple cyber attacks as cyber</text>
  <text start="783.53" dur="4.26">attacks hitting different countries and</text>
  <text start="785.6" dur="3.54">of course what what if they can hit they</text>
  <text start="787.79" dur="3.48">can hit the financial institutions</text>
  <text start="789.14" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re gonna bring down the banking</text>
  <text start="791.27" dur="4.17">system they&amp;#39;re gonna make it seem like</text>
  <text start="793.04" dur="5.28">the economy fell apart because of that</text>
  <text start="795.44" dur="4.41">and we know this is not why the economy</text>
  <text start="798.32" dur="3.51">is falling apart the economy&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="799.85" dur="4.5">apart because the Fed ran it into the</text>
  <text start="801.83" dur="6">ground and this was done on purpose</text>
  <text start="804.35" dur="4.95">because they profited from all of it and</text>
  <text start="807.83" dur="3.57">they want to restart it they know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="809.3" dur="5.52">coming to an end and they need to</text>
  <text start="811.4" dur="4.86">destroy it somehow someway and one great</text>
  <text start="814.82" dur="2.49">way to do this is with a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="816.26" dur="2.94">because you really don&amp;#39;t have to prove</text>
  <text start="817.31" dur="4.02">it they can just say hey I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="819.2" dur="3.6">the corporate media look we were hit by</text>
  <text start="821.33" dur="3.57">Russia we were hit by China we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="822.8" dur="4.47">hitting by North Korea and guess what</text>
  <text start="824.9" dur="3.42">they hit the financial institutions they</text>
  <text start="827.27" dur="3.18">might have wiped out</text>
  <text start="828.32" dur="3.45">everyone&amp;#39;s savings we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="830.45" dur="2.79">shut down the banks we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="831.77" dur="5.37">look into this and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="833.24" dur="6.03">see what really happened here and this</text>
  <text start="837.14" dur="3.87">is going to be very easy for them to do</text>
  <text start="839.27" dur="3.66">and this is why I&amp;#39;ve always said this is</text>
  <text start="841.01" dur="3.63">my personal opinion only keep what you</text>
  <text start="842.93" dur="3.54">need in the bank to pay your bills</text>
  <text start="844.64" dur="4.83">you should have cash on hand you had</text>
  <text start="846.47" dur="5.43">gold and silver to basically ensure your</text>
  <text start="849.47" dur="4.74">wealth might in want invest in</text>
  <text start="851.9" dur="3.87">cryptocurrency even if the internet does</text>
  <text start="854.21" dur="3.54">go down for a little while</text>
  <text start="855.77" dur="3.48">if it actually does I don&amp;#39;t think it</text>
  <text start="857.75" dur="3.06">will I think they&amp;#39;re just gonna close</text>
  <text start="859.25" dur="4.26">the financial institutions maybe the</text>
  <text start="860.81" dur="4.89">stock market the Nasdaq the sp500 and</text>
  <text start="863.51" dur="3.87">you won&amp;#39;t be able to access the banking</text>
  <text start="865.7" dur="4.11">systems but I think they&amp;#39;ll keep the</text>
  <text start="867.38" dur="4.56">Internet up and running we might see</text>
  <text start="869.81" dur="3.39">some cyber attacks to the power grid in</text>
  <text start="871.94" dur="3.59">certain areas but it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="873.2" dur="4.53">the entire country they just want it for</text>
  <text start="875.53" dur="4.12">propaganda purposes to scare people</text>
  <text start="877.73" dur="3.99">because all you have to do is hit one</text>
  <text start="879.65" dur="4.04">town or a couple of cities and people</text>
  <text start="881.72" dur="4.38">will be scared out of their minds and</text>
  <text start="883.69" dur="4.36">this will be very easy for them to do so</text>
  <text start="886.1" dur="3.6">even if you had cryptocurrency and guess</text>
  <text start="888.05" dur="5.4">what and you had it on an offline wallet</text>
  <text start="889.7" dur="4.89">you still have that no matter what and I</text>
  <text start="893.45" dur="2.55">don&amp;#39;t think the internet the whole</text>
  <text start="894.59" dur="4.89">internet it&amp;#39;s gonna come down that would</text>
  <text start="896" dur="4.59">be quite outrageous I mean they might do</text>
  <text start="899.48" dur="4.56">it but I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="900.59" dur="6.03">that far in doing it so you need to be</text>
  <text start="904.04" dur="3.84">ready and prepared for whatever happens</text>
  <text start="906.62" dur="3.48">here and it looks like they&amp;#39;re building</text>

  <text start="915.62" dur="4.92">different category but of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="918.5" dur="3.36">the opposite way category 1 is the worst</text>
  <text start="920.54" dur="4.26">compared to a hurricane which is</text>
  <text start="921.86" dur="5.07">category 5 and we&amp;#39;re seeing that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.8" dur="3.9">just building this up building this up</text>
