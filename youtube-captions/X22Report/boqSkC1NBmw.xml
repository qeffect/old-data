  <text start="327.759" dur="5.231">migrant pictures to criticize him so</text>
  <text start="330.59" dur="5.06">what the corporate media is doing is</text>
  <text start="332.99" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re taking the pictures back in 2014</text>
  <text start="335.65" dur="6.1">when Obama was bringing up all these</text>
  <text start="338.21" dur="6.269">illegals and remember he put this forth</text>
  <text start="341.75" dur="4.86">with his memorandum the B strain would</text>
  <text start="344.479" dur="5.401">bring all these people up here the kids</text>
  <text start="346.61" dur="6.69">were ages mainly from teenager on up</text>
  <text start="349.88" dur="5.49">bring them into the country push them</text>
  <text start="353.3" dur="4.14">into all different parts of the country</text>
  <text start="355.37" dur="4.65">into sanctuary cities and then they will</text>
  <text start="357.44" dur="3.99">bring their parents up here and back</text>
  <text start="360.02" dur="3.869">then the corporate media didn&amp;#39;t report</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="6.989">on it pretty much any of this and the</text>
  <text start="363.889" dur="6.931">kids stayed separated from their parents</text>
  <text start="368.419" dur="5.43">or they slept they kept they kept them</text>
  <text start="370.82" dur="5.01">in these cells and what was what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="373.849" dur="3.75">happening is the corporate media as</text>
  <text start="375.83" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re talking about Trump they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="377.599" dur="6.201">showing the pictures back from 2014</text>
  <text start="380.3" dur="6.149">because back then they allowed a</text>
  <text start="383.8" dur="4.27">reporter to go in take a look at the</text>
  <text start="386.449" dur="4.201">site take a look at what was going on</text>
  <text start="388.07" dur="5.279">and they took pictures but it was never</text>
  <text start="390.65" dur="4.29">really published back then they kept the</text>
  <text start="393.349" dur="3.361">pictures and now they&amp;#39;re putting them</text>
  <text start="394.94" dur="3.69">out there while they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="4.29">Trump and Trump is calling them out on</text>
  <text start="398.63" dur="4.469">on calling the corporate media out</text>
  <text start="401" dur="4.039">saying listen all these individuals</text>
  <text start="403.099" dur="5.13">wrapped up in foil things these are from</text>
  <text start="405.039" dur="5.56">Obama&amp;#39;s period of time back in 2014 and</text>
  <text start="408.229" dur="4.591">we can see right now there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="410.599" dur="3.961">amount of double standards this has to</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="5.069">do with the law that&amp;#39;s in place right</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="6.12">now and basically this has been going on</text>
  <text start="417.889" dur="4.681">for a very long time and Trump</text>
  <text start="420.68" dur="3.479">continually says that this law needs to</text>
  <text start="422.57" dur="3.569">be changed and that&amp;#39;s the whole point of</text>
  <text start="424.159" dur="3.75">all this where they&amp;#39;re saying oh he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.139" dur="3.721">the only one doing this this is been</text>
  <text start="427.909" dur="4.681">going on for quite a while this is</text>
  <text start="429.86" dur="5.88">nothing new we see that the Supreme</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="5.609">Court upheld the Trump travel ban and</text>
  <text start="435.74" dur="3.03">the Supreme Court handed the Trump</text>
  <text start="438.199" dur="2.911">administration</text>
  <text start="438.77" dur="4.019">it&amp;#39;s murder first major court victory</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="3.839">over its travel ban after three</text>
  <text start="442.789" dur="4.56">successive versions of the ban were</text>
  <text start="444.949" dur="4.171">challenged by lower courts and a five to</text>
  <text start="447.349" dur="3.44">four vote the conservatives of the court</text>
  <text start="449.12" dur="3.63">backed the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="450.789" dur="4.251">rejecting the notion that the ban</text>
  <text start="452.75" dur="3.97">discriminated against Muslims</text>
  <text start="455.04" dur="3.15">and refusing to question the</text>
  <text start="456.72" dur="3.87">administration&amp;#39;s national security</text>
  <text start="458.19" dur="4.89">claims the Supreme Court also rejected</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="4.2">San Francisco&amp;#39;s appeals court findings</text>
  <text start="463.08" dur="4.77">that Trump has had it exceeded his</text>
  <text start="464.79" dur="5.49">authority over immigration and we need</text>
  <text start="467.85" dur="4.35">to understand is that when we look at</text>
  <text start="470.28" dur="6.75">these countries that Trump is banning</text>
  <text start="472.2" dur="8.01">its Venezuela Libya Yemen Somalia Syria</text>
  <text start="477.03" dur="6.06">Iran and North Korea now North Korea</text>
  <text start="480.21" dur="4.83">there&amp;#39;s peace going on in that area</text>
  <text start="483.09" dur="5.61">right now so most likely that ban will</text>
  <text start="485.04" dur="5.4">be lifted Syria eventually Assad will</text>
  <text start="488.7" dur="4.62">take back his country the forces will be</text>
  <text start="490.44" dur="5.1">out of that area and I believe the ban</text>
  <text start="493.32" dur="5.07">will be lifted in that area</text>
  <text start="495.54" dur="5.28">Libya same thing Yemen we know that</text>
  <text start="498.39" dur="3.6">Somalia these are all the places where</text>
  <text start="500.82" dur="4.41">the deep State has gone into these</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="6.12">countries and had regime change and put</text>
  <text start="505.23" dur="4.56">in place their terrorist groups where</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="3.9">they were trying to have regime change</text>
  <text start="509.79" dur="3.75">where you see the Islamic state al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="512.01" dur="3.98">remember the paid mercenary army is</text>
  <text start="513.54" dur="5.78">within all of these countries</text>
  <text start="515.99" dur="6.609">maintaining control of everything and</text>
  <text start="519.32" dur="6.19">right now Trump is playing along with</text>
  <text start="522.599" dur="4.351">the deep state saying listen we should</text>
  <text start="525.51" dur="3.12">be afraid of these people right you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="526.95" dur="4.41">been telling us that terrorists are</text>
  <text start="528.63" dur="4.74">scary that the Islamic state al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="531.36" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re coming to get us well we should</text>
  <text start="533.37" dur="4.29">protect ourselves it&amp;#39;s a national</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="4.83">security problem so we need to be</text>
  <text start="537.66" dur="3.33">protected from all these different areas</text>
  <text start="539.82" dur="3.24">and of course the deep state doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="540.99" dur="4.95">want this because they know and we know</text>
  <text start="543.06" dur="5.82">that there are no terrorists these are</text>
  <text start="545.94" dur="4.68">the paid mercenary armies they created</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="4.35">them this is why they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="550.62" dur="5.7">problem in most of the most likely that</text>
  <text start="553.23" dur="5.28">they want these individuals moved back</text>
  <text start="556.32" dur="4.59">and forth in and out of the United</text>
  <text start="558.51" dur="5.34">States in different areas and Trump is</text>
  <text start="560.91" dur="6.93">putting a stop to this we see that Spain</text>
  <text start="563.85" dur="6">is refusing docking of migrant rescue</text>
  <text start="567.84" dur="3.96">ship Spanish authority said that they</text>

  <text start="749.83" dur="4.44">what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="750.94" dur="5.16">is the talks are going to begin where</text>
  <text start="754.27" dur="4.71">the Afghan government which was</text>
  <text start="756.1" dur="4.5">controlled by the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="758.98" dur="3.84">gonna want to make concessions now</text>
  <text start="760.6" dur="6.36">remember the deep state only sees black</text>

  <text start="766.96" dur="5.01">all the gray areas they say either do it</text>
  <text start="769.03" dur="5.73">our way or that&amp;#39;s it now without the</text>
  <text start="771.97" dur="6.6">deep state involved in these countries</text>
  <text start="774.76" dur="7.71">they can deal in the gray area and make</text>
  <text start="778.57" dur="5.31">deals with the countries just like the</text>
  <text start="782.47" dur="4.02">United States made a deal with North</text>
  <text start="783.88" dur="4.71">Korea because this the gray area wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="786.49" dur="4.77">either you give up nuclear weapons or we</text>
  <text start="788.59" dur="5.22">bomb you or we invade you let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="791.26" dur="4.35">about this let&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;ll give a little bit</text>
  <text start="793.81" dur="3.5">you&amp;#39;ll give a little bit let&amp;#39;s come</text>
  <text start="795.61" dur="4.05">together on this and that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="797.31" dur="5.02">diplomacy works but the deep state never</text>
  <text start="799.66" dur="4.32">wants this because they want what they</text>
  <text start="802.33" dur="4.38">want they want regime change they want</text>
  <text start="803.98" dur="7.26">to control the country and we can see</text>
  <text start="806.71" dur="6.72">right now that those days are over we</text>
  <text start="811.24" dur="5.76">see there&amp;#39;s protests in Iran now these</text>
  <text start="813.43" dur="7.71">protests look very very similar to the</text>
  <text start="817" dur="9.51">protests that we saw back in 2012 and in</text>
  <text start="821.14" dur="8.76">the end of 2017 going into 2018 and this</text>
  <text start="826.51" dur="6.06">seems like it&amp;#39;s being pushed by other</text>
  <text start="829.9" dur="4.53">forces just like we&amp;#39;ve seen in other</text>
  <text start="832.57" dur="4.98">countries like Ukraine and many other</text>
  <text start="834.43" dur="6.9">because once we see violence and we see</text>
  <text start="837.55" dur="6.69">a small group of people trying to stir</text>
  <text start="841.33" dur="5.43">things up we know that things aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="844.24" dur="4.5">going in the right direction and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="846.76" dur="6.72">trying to be pushed in a certain</text>
  <text start="848.74" dur="7.34">direction and we see right now that Q</text>
  <text start="853.48" dur="4.46">has told us that there was going to be a</text>
  <text start="856.08" dur="3.54">movement I don&amp;#39;t know if this is the</text>
  <text start="857.94" dur="6.15">movement because it doesn&amp;#39;t look like</text>
  <text start="859.62" dur="6.42">this is a grassroots movement and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="864.09" dur="5.67">have to watch this very carefully to see</text>
  <text start="866.04" dur="8.04">how this goes but once again the Iranian</text>
  <text start="869.76" dur="8.25">people they work together and we saw</text>
  <text start="874.08" dur="6.9">this back in 2018 in January where the</text>
  <text start="878.01" dur="6.15">protesters they all work together they</text>
  <text start="880.98" dur="5.58">talk to each other and once again the</text>
  <text start="884.16" dur="6.63">protests aren&amp;#39;t happening in every city</text>
  <text start="886.56" dur="6.36">in Iran it&amp;#39;s really into ran and mostly</text>
  <text start="890.79" dur="5.4">at the bazaar and maybe in a couple</text>
  <text start="892.92" dur="5.61">other places but very very tiny and this</text>
  <text start="896.19" dur="5.43">might get bigger but right now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="898.53" dur="6.39">small and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this all</text>
  <text start="901.62" dur="6.27">plays out we see that this Syrian army</text>
  <text start="904.92" dur="5.04">right now they are pushing south to the</text>
  <text start="907.89" dur="4.65">second major town in the southwest of</text>
  <text start="909.96" dur="5.61">Syria they are liberating many different</text>
  <text start="912.54" dur="5.58">towns the elite Tiger forces they</text>
  <text start="915.57" dur="6.92">managed to crack the lines of the paid</text>
  <text start="918.12" dur="8.49">mercenary rebels and they pushed through</text>
  <text start="922.49" dur="8.04">Busra al carrier and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="926.61" dur="7.74">moving south in Syria now Israel</text>
  <text start="930.53" dur="6.46">reportedly fired missiles at the city of</text>
  <text start="934.35" dur="5.73">Damascus and they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="936.99" dur="5.94">missiles hit an Iranian cargo plane</text>
  <text start="940.08" dur="4.98">Syria is saying that the missiles hit</text>
  <text start="942.93" dur="4.29">but there was no damage anywhere and</text>
  <text start="945.06" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re not reporting that it hit any</text>
  <text start="947.22" dur="6.21">type of plane or anything like that</text>
  <text start="949.26" dur="7.05">so we see right now that there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="953.43" dur="5.34">story out there what really happened we</text>
  <text start="956.31" dur="5.1">don&amp;#39;t know as of yet but there are no</text>
  <text start="958.77" dur="5.22">verified reports about the Iranian plane</text>
  <text start="961.41" dur="5.1">being targeted and being hit they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="963.99" dur="4.44">saying gas missiles flew in but they</text>
  <text start="966.51" dur="3.45">didn&amp;#39;t do any damage anywhere else we</text>
  <text start="968.43" dur="4.44">see that the Russian Deputy Foreign</text>
  <text start="969.96" dur="5.1">Minister says that over 40% of the</text>
  <text start="972.87" dur="6.53">so-called southwestern de-escalation</text>
  <text start="975.06" dur="8.04">zone is controlled by terrorists and if</text>
  <text start="979.4" dur="5.02">the de-escalation zones have this many</text>
  <text start="983.1" dur="4.56">terrorists in there</text>
  <text start="984.42" dur="5.58">well the serene forces the Russian</text>
  <text start="987.66" dur="5.49">forces they&amp;#39;re justified</text>
  <text start="990" dur="8.22">in having military operations in this</text>
  <text start="993.15" dur="8.55">area and I believe this is why the u.s.</text>
  <text start="998.22" dur="6.24">is distancing themselves from these paid</text>
  <text start="1001.7" dur="5.61">mercenary forces because I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1004.46" dur="5.58">going to happen here is Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="1007.31" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re going to be attacking these paid</text>
  <text start="1010.04" dur="4.53">mercenary forces and the u.s. is going</text>
  <text start="1012.47" dur="4.05">to be stepping back saying okay you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1014.57" dur="4.38">on your own we have nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="1016.52" dur="4.56">this and I think this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="1018.95" dur="4.92">steps of the US where they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="1021.08" dur="4.71">moving themselves out of Syria right now</text>
  <text start="1023.87" dur="4.61">and I think eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1025.79" dur="5.549">happen there&amp;#39;s going to be talks and</text>
  <text start="1028.48" dur="4.87">eventually after I think Trump meets</text>
  <text start="1031.339" dur="5.011">Putin we&amp;#39;re going to see something</text>
  <text start="1033.35" dur="6.359">happen in Syria where troops start to</text>
  <text start="1036.35" dur="7.07">move out of this area we see that from</text>
  <text start="1039.709" dur="8.821">reports the US UK they&amp;#39;ve been financing</text>
  <text start="1043.42" dur="8.11">54 groups in Syria right now and this is</text>
  <text start="1048.53" dur="6.81">not just the u.s. it&amp;#39;s Israel Britain</text>
  <text start="1051.53" dur="7.95">France Jordan the Persian Gulf states</text>
  <text start="1055.34" dur="8.25">and they&amp;#39;ve been supporting supplying 54</text>
  <text start="1059.48" dur="6.54">militia groups in Syria and we can see</text>
  <text start="1063.59" dur="5.46">that this was all part of the deep state</text>
  <text start="1066.02" dur="5.67">plan to go after Assad but all this</text>
  <text start="1069.05" dur="5.9">funding is coming to an end and has come</text>
  <text start="1071.69" dur="7.17">to an end and these groups they are</text>
  <text start="1074.95" dur="6.76">floundering in Syria right now we see</text>
  <text start="1078.86" dur="5.43">that Ben Rhodes who was the national</text>
  <text start="1081.71" dur="5.73">security adviser to Obama he was being</text>
  <text start="1084.29" dur="7.2">interviewed by the intercept reporter</text>
  <text start="1087.44" dur="7.11">Mehdi Hassan and this individual put a</text>
  <text start="1091.49" dur="6.84">question to Ben Rhodes and said to Ben</text>

  <text start="1101.72" dur="4.8">terrorist groups in Syria the jihadists</text>
  <text start="1104.39" dur="4.89">in Syria and we need to remember Rhodes</text>
  <text start="1106.52" dur="5.19">has been described as being so trusted</text>
  <text start="1109.28" dur="5.04">and close to Obama that he was in the</text>
  <text start="1111.71" dur="5.13">room for almost every foreign policy</text>
  <text start="1114.32" dur="5.97">decision of significance that Obama made</text>
  <text start="1116.84" dur="5.37">during his eight years in office now in</text>
  <text start="1120.29" dur="2.81">spite of Rhodes trying to dance around</text>
  <text start="1122.21" dur="4.13">the issue</text>
  <text start="1123.1" dur="5.189">answer the questions the reporter kept</text>
  <text start="1126.34" dur="5.969">on asking the same question over and</text>
