  <text start="78.02" dur="8.58">being pushed as this virus that can be</text>
  <text start="82.64" dur="7.229">spread sexually that it can create birth</text>
  <text start="86.6" dur="4.95">defects that it&amp;#39;s linked to all these</text>
  <text start="89.869" dur="5.851">different things it might be linked to</text>
  <text start="91.55" dur="6.749">more but we showed yesterday that a lot</text>
  <text start="95.72" dur="5.16">of this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense because we</text>
  <text start="98.299" dur="5.941">showed that of the cases that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="100.88" dur="6.15">reporting those that actually had the</text>
  <text start="104.24" dur="4.949">Zika virus is a very small number so</text>
  <text start="107.03" dur="4.83">there&amp;#39;s really no correlation to what</text>
  <text start="109.189" dur="5.311">they&amp;#39;re talking about and we know this</text>
  <text start="111.86" dur="5.939">is part of their agenda it&amp;#39;s to scare</text>
  <text start="114.5" dur="6.689">the population it&amp;#39;s to push the idea</text>
  <text start="117.799" dur="5.581">that we need another vaccine and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.189" dur="4.231">many other agendas associated with this</text>
  <text start="123.38" dur="5.07">and we have to remember that this</text>
  <text start="125.42" dur="4.979">originated in Brazil where Bill and</text>
  <text start="128.45" dur="5.069">Melinda Gates their foundation was</text>
  <text start="130.399" dur="8.31">experimenting on GMO genetically</text>
  <text start="133.519" dur="8.611">modified mosquitoes and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="138.709" dur="5.701">interesting that it occurred in Brazil</text>
  <text start="142.13" dur="5.88">because we know Brazil is part of the</text>
  <text start="144.41" dur="6.389">bricks we know in six months the games</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="5.009">the Olympic Games they&amp;#39;re going to open</text>
  <text start="150.799" dur="8.761">in Rio we know Brazil&amp;#39;s economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.019" dur="10.911">hurting was this a plan to try to</text>
  <text start="159.56" dur="7.129">destroy the economy</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="6.36">which is already declining but really</text>
  <text start="166.689" dur="6.39">bring it to its knees by having this</text>
  <text start="170.29" dur="6.179">outbreak because with this outbreak if</text>
  <text start="173.079" dur="4.77">they continually use the propaganda that</text>
  <text start="176.469" dur="3.211">it&amp;#39;s spreading because they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="177.849" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s going to be about what four</text>
  <text start="179.68" dur="4.41">million people in the americas that are</text>
  <text start="181.719" dur="4.11">going to be infected of course we know</text>
  <text start="184.09" dur="5.34">in the next couple of weeks are probably</text>
  <text start="185.829" dur="8.24">going to up into eight million but are</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="7.949">they using this to damage the bricks and</text>
  <text start="194.069" dur="6.581">damage the countries that belong to the</text>
  <text start="197.379" dur="6.601">bricks damaged their economies it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.65" dur="6.809">starting to look like this because as we</text>
  <text start="203.98" dur="7.649">see the brick banks they are open for</text>
  <text start="207.459" dur="5.941">business they are loaning money and we</text>
  <text start="211.629" dur="6.03">can see most of the nations are</text>
  <text start="213.4" dur="5.91">completely bypassing the dollar they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.659" dur="5.131">using their own currencies or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.31" dur="6.329">using the one on the ruble and you need</text>
  <text start="222.79" dur="8.18">to think maybe this is another part of</text>
  <text start="225.639" dur="9.96">the agenda and we know that the economy</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="9.639">the private western central bank nations</text>
  <text start="235.599" dur="6.75">the economies they&amp;#39;re collapsing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.609" dur="8.19">nothing they can do about it if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="242.349" dur="8.911">going to collapse the debt that&amp;#39;s spread</text>
  <text start="248.799" dur="5.19">around the world can it cannot be</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="5.49">sustained it&amp;#39;s impossible this is why</text>
  <text start="253.989" dur="6.601">Christine Lagarde from the IMF wanted a</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="6.63">ten percent wealth tax you know to help</text>
  <text start="260.59" dur="5.009">them out a little bit here not to pay</text>
  <text start="263.38" dur="6.529">off the debt they just want some more</text>
  <text start="265.599" dur="6.75">time but we know most of the countries</text>
  <text start="269.909" dur="5.38">the government structure they realize</text>
  <text start="272.349" dur="4.981">that eventually the system&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="275.289" dur="5.22">come down there&amp;#39;s going to be civil</text>

  <text start="296.169" dur="2.671">united states</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="3.119">and what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="298.84" dur="6.12">to remove the people&amp;#39;s rights they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.729" dur="6.361">trying to draw in power to a single</text>

  <text start="315.28" dur="4.62">aims to extend the state of emergency</text>
  <text start="316.9" dur="7.799">for another three months the state of</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="8.609">emergency has been in place since the</text>
  <text start="324.699" dur="7.74">terrorist attacks in Paris on November</text>
  <text start="328.509" dur="5.701">of 2015 and they&amp;#39;re saying the state of</text>
  <text start="332.439" dur="5.211">emergency will be prolonged until the</text>
  <text start="334.21" dur="8.91">law on new judicial procedures is</text>
  <text start="337.65" dur="7.479">implemented so it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="3.87">going to extend this people are</text>
  <text start="345.129" dur="4.891">protesting say they saying they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="346.99" dur="8.579">want this at all and it allows President</text>
  <text start="350.02" dur="7.679">Hollande to receive more power and we</text>
  <text start="355.569" dur="5.671">see that the United States President</text>
  <text start="357.699" dur="6.87">already has executive orders and certain</text>
  <text start="361.24" dur="6.78">things in place to receive power if he</text>
  <text start="364.569" dur="5.4">needs to declare a state of emergency we</text>
  <text start="368.02" dur="5.369">see this in Canada we see this in</text>
  <text start="369.969" dur="7.591">Australia we see this in the UK all</text>
  <text start="373.389" dur="8.011">these countries have this and we know</text>
  <text start="377.56" dur="6.87">that they realize that there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="381.4" dur="4.859">be a huge problem when this economy</text>
  <text start="384.43" dur="3.959">falls apart I mean they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="386.259" dur="3.87">spying on the people they have already</text>
  <text start="388.389" dur="3.571">said yes we&amp;#39;re implementing these</text>
  <text start="390.129" dur="4.621">programs to spy on the people to</text>
  <text start="391.96" dur="5.639">understand what they&amp;#39;re thinking who</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="5.699">they&amp;#39;re communicating with and this is</text>
  <text start="397.599" dur="7.68">all because of civil unrest economic</text>
  <text start="400.449" dur="7.53">collapse riots and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="405.279" dur="6">more events occur to take away more</text>
  <text start="407.979" dur="7.41">rights to scare the people in giving</text>
  <text start="411.279" dur="10.88">more of their rights away this is going</text>
  <text start="415.389" dur="11.07">to continue North Korea right now is</text>
  <text start="422.159" dur="5.98">allegedly helping Iran improve its</text>
  <text start="426.459" dur="3.45">ballistic missile now we know North</text>
  <text start="428.139" dur="3.331">Korea notify the UN saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="429.909" dur="5.101">going to have a satellite launch</text>
  <text start="431.47" dur="4.89">of course all the private western</text>
  <text start="435.01" dur="3.84">central bank countries are out there</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="5.37">saying oh it&amp;#39;s a ballistic missile test</text>
  <text start="438.85" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;re you know condemning anything that</text>
  <text start="441.73" dur="5.07">North Korea does even if it is a launch</text>
  <text start="444.64" dur="4.92">to launch a satellite into space and</text>
  <text start="446.8" dur="5.1">they notify the UN and they&amp;#39;re letting</text>
  <text start="449.56" dur="5.01">everyone know what they&amp;#39;re doing we</text>
  <text start="451.9" dur="4.41">still condemn all of this because they</text>
  <text start="454.57" dur="6.15">must have some type of components that</text>
  <text start="456.31" dur="6.96">can be used for a ballistic missile but</text>
  <text start="460.72" dur="4.62">the thing is this is all propaganda and</text>
  <text start="463.27" dur="5.88">more propaganda saying that North Korea</text>
  <text start="465.34" dur="8">is helping Iran basically extend their</text>
  <text start="469.15" dur="8.49">ballistic missiles remember certain</text>
  <text start="473.34" dur="8.95">factions in the government they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="477.64" dur="10.38">want peace they want war and they will</text>
  <text start="482.29" dur="10.26">use propaganda to make war happen right</text>
  <text start="488.02" dur="8.46">now we see South Korea is saying that</text>
  <text start="492.55" dur="8.31">China flew their jets into Korea&amp;#39;s air</text>
  <text start="496.48" dur="5.97">defense identification zone and this is</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="5.309">the point where the zones of the two</text>
  <text start="502.45" dur="7.41">countries overlap and the Chinese are</text>
  <text start="506.169" dur="6.481">saying absolutely not and the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="9">saying yeah we think this happened but</text>
  <text start="512.65" dur="8.79">again do we have proof not really now</text>
  <text start="518.86" dur="5.12">the air defense identification zones of</text>
  <text start="521.44" dur="5.01">Korea and China overlap because Beijing</text>
  <text start="523.98" dur="6.37">unilaterally announced its own zone in</text>
  <text start="526.45" dur="6.48">November 2013 then the South Korean</text>
  <text start="530.35" dur="5.97">government in response announced its own</text>
  <text start="532.93" dur="6.51">widened zone with the u.s. support but</text>
  <text start="536.32" dur="5.55">China didn&amp;#39;t acknowledge it so everyone</text>
  <text start="539.44" dur="6.63">has their own zone and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="541.87" dur="7.74">this is part of our country and of</text>
  <text start="546.07" dur="4.94">course the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="549.61" dur="4.56">government has to point this out because</text>
  <text start="551.01" dur="9.19">again they&amp;#39;re using propaganda and</text>
  <text start="554.17" dur="8.49">they&amp;#39;re using this to provoke war to</text>
  <text start="560.2" dur="3.819">provoke china just like they&amp;#39;re doing in</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="4.329">the Pacific</text>
  <text start="564.019" dur="6.18">when the u.s. sales very close to their</text>
  <text start="566.989" dur="6.15">islands little by little they&amp;#39;re poking</text>
  <text start="570.199" dur="5.851">poking poking at China little by little</text>
  <text start="573.139" dur="7.651">they&amp;#39;re poking poking at North Korea and</text>
  <text start="576.05" dur="7.459">Russia now in the Ukraine Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="580.79" dur="5.489">going to lose about 1.1 billion on</text>
  <text start="583.509" dur="9.33">exports in 2016 due to the Russian</text>
  <text start="586.279" dur="6.56">embargo and Ukraine&amp;#39;s economy is really</text>
  <text start="593.17" dur="7.029">falling apart it it is collapsed</text>
  <text start="596.149" dur="5.67">completely now Kiev is doing something</text>
  <text start="600.199" dur="3.781">very odd they&amp;#39;re closing one of their</text>
  <text start="601.819" dur="5.971">checkpoints in Donbass on the contact</text>
  <text start="603.98" dur="5.899">line and their explanation for this was</text>
  <text start="607.79" dur="6.06">that there was a deterioration of</text>
  <text start="609.879" dur="7.601">security in the region and they needed</text>
  <text start="613.85" dur="9.169">to shut this down and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="617.48" dur="12.18">Kiev attempted to break through into</text>
  <text start="623.019" dur="8.35">Donetsk the Ukrainian side attempted a</text>
  <text start="629.66" dur="6.33">breakthrough on the northern outskirts</text>
  <text start="631.369" dur="6.66">of donuts with continued shelling now it</text>
  <text start="635.99" dur="4.939">failed but we can see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="638.029" dur="7.081">right now they closed checkpoints</text>
  <text start="640.929" dur="6.85">they&amp;#39;re pushing forward and we see</text>
  <text start="645.11" dur="5.099">poroshenko out there saying that the</text>
  <text start="647.779" dur="6.6">risk of open war between Russia and</text>
  <text start="650.209" dur="8.31">Ukraine is greater now than it was a</text>
  <text start="654.379" dur="5.52">year ago does that make any sense when</text>
  <text start="658.519" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re supposed to be implementing the</text>
  <text start="659.899" dur="5.97">mints to cease fire agreement they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="662.569" dur="5.01">saying that Russia is building up its</text>

  <text start="667.579" dur="8.281">Ukraine and he sees open war with Russia</text>
  <text start="672.319" dur="6.99">right now and this is showing us that</text>
  <text start="675.86" dur="7.409">they are building the propaganda to</text>
  <text start="679.309" dur="6.33">convince everyone that Ukraine will be</text>
  <text start="683.269" dur="3.57">going to war once again and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.639" dur="4.05">going to blame it on Russia and the</text>

  <text start="776.71" dur="7.72">he continually lets the United States</text>
  <text start="781.67" dur="6.09">know and the coalition forces that</text>
  <text start="784.43" dur="6.39">listen Moscow will continue its</text>

  <text start="800" dur="7.11">to stop their air raids Lavrov replied I</text>
  <text start="804.77" dur="5.34">don&amp;#39;t see why these airstrikes should be</text>
  <text start="807.11" dur="4.86">stopped against the Islamic state or any</text>
  <text start="810.11" dur="5.04">of the other terrorist organizations it</text>
  <text start="811.97" dur="7.47">makes no sense why would we stop it at</text>
  <text start="815.15" dur="7.25">this point why would the u.s. ask for</text>
  <text start="819.44" dur="7.2">Russia to stop it because it it&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="822.4" dur="7.78">proxy army and they&amp;#39;re destroying it</text>
  <text start="826.64" dur="4.819">they&amp;#39;re losing many of the proxy</text>
  <text start="830.18" dur="4.739">soldiers</text>
  <text start="831.459" dur="5.62">this is why Qatar Turkey Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="834.919" dur="7.801">the United States airlifted a lot of</text>
  <text start="837.079" dur="10.67">them out of Syria into Libya now it</text>
  <text start="842.72" dur="9.089">looks like Saudi Arabia Qatar Turkey</text>
  <text start="847.749" dur="8.13">they told the opposition to quit the</text>
  <text start="851.809" dur="8.161">Geneva talks and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="855.879" dur="7.21">they&amp;#39;re going to leave the talks because</text>
  <text start="859.97" dur="6.299">they can&amp;#39;t find common ground so the</text>
  <text start="863.089" dur="9.69">talks in Syria they have been suspended</text>
  <text start="866.269" dur="11.91">until februari 25th now and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="872.779" dur="9.3">that the Syrian government is blaming</text>
  <text start="878.179" dur="7.291">Saudi Arabia Turkey and Qatar for the</text>
  <text start="882.079" dur="5.91">suspension and we know the United States</text>
  <text start="885.47" dur="6.619">government central bankers they do not</text>
  <text start="887.989" dur="9.06">want peace this is a tactic to delay and</text>
  <text start="892.089" dur="9.16">to buy them some time right now the US</text>
  <text start="897.049" dur="8.16">government and their terrorist</text>
  <text start="901.249" dur="6.15">organizations they&amp;#39;re losing the battle</text>
  <text start="905.209" dur="4.62">there the US government&amp;#39;s back is</text>
  <text start="907.399" dur="3.63">against the wall and like a wild animal</text>
  <text start="909.829" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re going to come out with their</text>
  <text start="911.029" dur="5.88">claws and they&amp;#39;re going to do something</text>
  <text start="913.789" dur="6.96">that is not going to be good for the</text>
  <text start="916.909" dur="7.29">rest of the world and while these talks</text>
  <text start="920.749" dur="5.79">are suspended we might see some type of</text>
  <text start="924.199" dur="6.24">an event we know they&amp;#39;ve been planning</text>
  <text start="926.539" dur="9.05">on doing something we know that the US</text>
  <text start="930.439" dur="9.21">has basically brought in military assets</text>
  <text start="935.589" dur="7.24">soldiers commandeered an airbase inside</text>
  <text start="939.649" dur="6.451">Syria remember the u.s. is not invited</text>
  <text start="942.829" dur="6.51">into Syria to help fight the Islamic</text>
  <text start="946.1" dur="6.419">state United States said we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="949.339" dur="4.89">into a sovereign nation to fight a</text>
  <text start="952.519" dur="4.14">terrorist group it&amp;#39;s like Mexico</text>
  <text start="954.229" dur="4.2">bringing or Canada bringing their</text>
  <text start="956.659" dur="3.691">soldiers into the United States saying</text>
  <text start="958.429" dur="3.421">okay we&amp;#39;re going to be fighting a</text>
  <text start="960.35" dur="2.25">terrorist group and we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="961.85" dur="3.28">permission of the United States</text>
  <text start="962.6" dur="6.16">government I mean would that work</text>
  <text start="965.13" dur="8.04">now this is exactly what the US is doing</text>
  <text start="968.76" dur="7.47">in Syria Syria has asked Russia to come</text>
  <text start="973.17" dur="6.24">in and fight the terrorists so the</text>
  <text start="976.23" dur="5.22">United States has an airbase they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="979.41" dur="4.59">bringing in military assets they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="981.45" dur="5.52">bringing in ground troops into the area</text>
  <text start="984" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re getting the coalition forces to</text>
  <text start="986.97" dur="3.96">bring in more ground troops and it looks</text>
  <text start="988.65" dur="4.98">like they&amp;#39;re going to mount a ground</text>
  <text start="990.93" dur="6.98">offensive because right now they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="993.63" dur="7.95">use the air Russia has a no-fly zone</text>
  <text start="997.91" dur="6.58">Russia has their electronic jamming</text>
  <text start="1001.58" dur="6.74">equipment which will Jam the coalition</text>
  <text start="1004.49" dur="7.95">forces aircraft and make them useless</text>
  <text start="1008.32" dur="9.07">they have the s-300 and the s400 defense</text>
  <text start="1012.44" dur="8.1">missile systems and guess what the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1017.39" dur="7.53">cannot battle in this way and they need</text>
  <text start="1020.54" dur="7.32">the ground troops to go into Syria to</text>
  <text start="1024.92" dur="7.1">help out the Islamic state this is why</text>
  <text start="1027.86" dur="6.66">the US wants Russia and Syria to allow</text>
  <text start="1032.02" dur="4.6">humanitarian aid when did the United</text>
  <text start="1034.52" dur="5.28">States care about bringing in</text>
  <text start="1036.62" dur="5.43">humanitarian aid how long has this war</text>
  <text start="1039.8" dur="3.93">been going on and when did the u.s. all</text>
  <text start="1042.05" dur="3.87">of a sudden say you know something we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1043.73" dur="4.29">going to pause here for a second so we</text>
  <text start="1045.92" dur="3.63">can bring in humanitarian aid and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1048.02" dur="5.82">talking about the u.s. doing this on</text>
  <text start="1049.55" dur="8.07">their own not when Russia steps in or</text>
  <text start="1053.84" dur="7.11">the UN steps in they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1057.62" dur="6.99">humanitarian aid they want to open up a</text>
  <text start="1060.95" dur="7.62">supply line to the terrace they want to</text>
  <text start="1064.61" dur="8.28">reinforce them they want to remove them</text>
  <text start="1068.57" dur="8.34">from certain areas so why all this is</text>
  <text start="1072.89" dur="5.7">happening we see the United States and</text>
  <text start="1076.91" dur="6.45">the coalition forces getting ready to</text>
  <text start="1078.59" dur="8.13">invade Libya at the same time they need</text>
  <text start="1083.36" dur="5.52">at this point to kick off war they need</text>
  <text start="1086.72" dur="6.18">to bring Russia into this war they need</text>
  <text start="1088.88" dur="7.8">China in this war most likely it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1092.9" dur="5.85">to be Iran in this war and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1096.68" dur="6.99">be the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="1098.75" dur="11.18">against Russia China Iran North Korea</text>
  <text start="1103.67" dur="10.56">and this will start World War three now</text>
  <text start="1109.93" dur="11.59">we&amp;#39;re seeing from the rand corp and they</text>
  <text start="1114.23" dur="10.41">ran scenarios of how this would turn out</text>
  <text start="1121.52" dur="6.65">in the baltic region where we have NATO</text>
  <text start="1124.64" dur="5.97">and US forces fighting against Russia</text>
  <text start="1128.17" dur="5.2">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve turned up and</text>
  <text start="1130.61" dur="4.83">they ran this many many times they said</text>
  <text start="1133.37" dur="4.02">the Russian military forces will swiftly</text>
  <text start="1135.44" dur="4.98">defeat the north atlantic treaty</text>
  <text start="1137.39" dur="6.93">organization which is NATO and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1140.42" dur="8.73">in less than three days should a War</text>
  <text start="1144.32" dur="7.32">break out in the Baltic region the RAND</text>
  <text start="1149.15" dur="4.64">Corporation comprised of American</text>
  <text start="1151.64" dur="5.88">military officers and civilian officials</text>
  <text start="1153.79" dur="8.53">made the projection and they are showing</text>
  <text start="1157.52" dur="6.69">that this is a no-win scenario they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1162.32" dur="3.78">saying such a rapid defeat would leave</text>
  <text start="1164.21" dur="6.87">NATO with limited number of options</text>
  <text start="1166.1" dur="6.63">which are all bad so right now they are</text>
  <text start="1171.08" dur="3.99">letting us know and this is not the</text>
  <text start="1172.73" dur="5.52">first time they&amp;#39;ve done this they are</text>
  <text start="1175.07" dur="7.1">letting us know that if we go to war</text>
  <text start="1178.25" dur="6">right now with rushers superior weaponry</text>
  <text start="1182.17" dur="6.76">compared to what the united states has</text>
  <text start="1184.25" dur="9.72">and what NATO has the u.s. is going to</text>
  <text start="1188.93" dur="9.2">lose in this area and if China joins in</text>
  <text start="1193.97" dur="6.57">to the fight it&amp;#39;s that much worse and</text>
  <text start="1198.13" dur="6.64">you know what&amp;#39;s going to happen at this</text>
  <text start="1200.54" dur="7.83">point once the United States feels that</text>
  <text start="1204.77" dur="9.18">they&amp;#39;re losing and there&amp;#39;s no way to win</text>
  <text start="1208.37" dur="9.75">this war most likely those in government</text>
  <text start="1213.95" dur="9.81">the neocons they will fire the first</text>
  <text start="1218.12" dur="8.58">nuke they will fire it at Russia now</text>
  <text start="1223.76" dur="6.24">think about this for a second they</text>
  <text start="1226.7" dur="6.07">believe in their minds that these</text>
  <text start="1230" dur="7.84">missile shields that they&amp;#39;ve set up</text>
  <text start="1232.77" dur="7.63">they think that&amp;#39;s going to stop the</text>
  <text start="1237.84" dur="8.61">Russian missiles with nuclear warheads</text>
  <text start="1240.4" dur="10.68">from hitting the United States it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1246.45" dur="6.28">they ran another scenario most of the</text>
  <text start="1251.08" dur="3.62">missile shields that they had and the</text>
  <text start="1252.73" dur="5">missile shields they have right now are</text>
  <text start="1254.7" dur="5.59">basically obsolete compared to what</text>
  <text start="1257.73" dur="4.9">Russia has and what they can do with</text>
  <text start="1260.29" dur="5.85">their missiles and how they can maneuver</text>
  <text start="1262.63" dur="8.96">on their own and it makes the intercept</text>
  <text start="1266.14" dur="10.55">very very difficult and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1271.59" dur="7.78">this is a no-win scenario at this point</text>
  <text start="1276.69" dur="5.14">that this is going to be this is going</text>
  <text start="1279.37" dur="6.63">to devastate Europe actually Europe will</text>
  <text start="1281.83" dur="9.02">be completely destroyed and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1286" dur="9.9">this is not like world war two missiles</text>
  <text start="1290.85" dur="7.75">can reach the United States missiles</text>
  <text start="1295.9" dur="3.99">with nuclear warheads it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="1298.6" dur="4.5">be like in World War two where the</text>
  <text start="1299.89" dur="6.24">Japanese sent up you know bombs in</text>
  <text start="1303.1" dur="4.56">balloons and they basically caught the</text>
  <text start="1306.13" dur="4.68">wind current to get them over here in</text>
  <text start="1307.66" dur="5.91">the United States missiles will be</text>
  <text start="1310.81" dur="10.67">flying in the air and they will hit our</text>
  <text start="1313.57" dur="7.91">cities we will see war on our soil and</text>
  <text start="1321.54" dur="8.74">these warmongers they don&amp;#39;t care they</text>
  <text start="1327.22" dur="6.39">don&amp;#39;t care because they believe that</text>
  <text start="1330.28" dur="5.73">they will still win and they have</text>
  <text start="1333.61" dur="6.72">bunkers ready they have their own power</text>
  <text start="1336.01" dur="9.66">grid system they&amp;#39;re prepared for this</text>
  <text start="1340.33" dur="8.82">and when we see this moving in this</text>
  <text start="1345.67" dur="5.76">direction the people of the UF the</text>
  <text start="1349.15" dur="9.24">people of Europe the people in Canada</text>
