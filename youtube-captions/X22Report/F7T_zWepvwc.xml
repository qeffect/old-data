  <text start="80.899" dur="7.121">realizing that they have no way out of</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="7.77">this and they&amp;#39;re realizing that if we</text>
  <text start="88.02" dur="6.599">continue on with raising rates or not</text>
  <text start="91.74" dur="4.44">pushing stimulus the entire economic</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="5.64">systems going to collapse</text>
  <text start="96.18" dur="8.85">now remember this was their plan prior</text>
  <text start="100.259" dur="8.04">to 2019 their plan was to bring down the</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="5.339">entire economic system the problem was</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="5.101">is that Trump was making the economy</text>
  <text start="110.369" dur="4.86">look fantastic and he was continually</text>
  <text start="113.4" dur="4.62">pointing out that it was the Fed that</text>
  <text start="115.229" dur="5.82">was the problem then we got word from</text>
  <text start="118.02" dur="5.04">cue that they know the plan and they</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="5.341">were going to turn this around and cue</text>
  <text start="123.06" dur="5.76">let us know in 2018 that the Federal</text>
  <text start="126.39" dur="5.099">Reserve was going to stop raising rates</text>
  <text start="128.82" dur="5.37">and this is exactly what happened the</text>
  <text start="131.489" dur="5.401">Fed came out as Trump continually bashed</text>
  <text start="134.19" dur="4.32">them and said we&amp;#39;re no longer raising</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="5.129">rates we&amp;#39;re gonna just hold them steady</text>
  <text start="138.51" dur="5.49">watch the economy make sure that</text>
  <text start="142.019" dur="5.011">everything is going the way we want and</text>
  <text start="144" dur="4.739">then trip continually push the Fed and</text>
  <text start="147.03" dur="4.679">said listen we need the rates lowered</text>
  <text start="148.739" dur="5.791">and all of a sudden the Fed to start</text>
  <text start="151.709" dur="5.641">decided to lower the rates</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="5.37">the Federal Reserve the central bank</text>
  <text start="157.35" dur="6.36">around the world all of them they</text>
  <text start="159.9" dur="8.07">realize that their entire plan went up</text>
  <text start="163.71" dur="7.2">in flames there&amp;#39;s no way to explain why</text>
  <text start="167.97" dur="4.83">the entire economic system is falling</text>
  <text start="170.91" dur="3.84">apart they don&amp;#39;t have their event</text>
  <text start="172.8" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re completely exposed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="174.75" dur="4.86">starting to realize this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="177.84" dur="3.75">getting a little nervous just like the</text>
  <text start="179.61" dur="3.81">deep state will be discussing this in a</text>
  <text start="181.59" dur="4.38">little bit but first I wanted to head</text>
  <text start="183.42" dur="5.55">out to the UK because we can see that</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="5.46">Johnson and McCrone they agreed on a</text>
  <text start="188.97" dur="4.83">three-month extension after a phone call</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="2.94">was initiated by Johnson now what</text>
  <text start="193.8" dur="4.85">happened</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="7.92">the Tories Liberal Democrats the SNP are</text>
  <text start="198.65" dur="4.9">all on board for elections rather than</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="3.21">attempt to press through the withdrawal</text>
  <text start="203.55" dur="4.68">bill that would be loaded with</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="5.76">amendments Johnson instead has decided</text>
  <text start="208.23" dur="6.15">to press for elections now let&amp;#39;s make</text>
  <text start="211.26" dur="5.13">sense of all this Johnson is so far</text>
  <text start="214.38" dur="4.77">ahead in the polls that he would rather</text>
  <text start="216.39" dur="4.86">gamble on elections the Liberal</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="4.44">Democrats desperately need elections to</text>
  <text start="221.25" dur="4.92">pick up seats from the Labor Party that</text>
  <text start="223.59" dur="6.27">is their second agenda their first</text>
  <text start="226.17" dur="8.22">agenda outright staying in the EU is</text>
  <text start="229.86" dur="6.62">dead a Johnson win would strengthen the</text>
  <text start="234.39" dur="5.49">case for another Scottish referendum</text>
  <text start="236.48" dur="6.19">labour does not want an election but has</text>
  <text start="239.88" dur="4.8">to pretend that it does and they finally</text>
  <text start="242.67" dur="5.4">realized that Labour leader Jeremy</text>
  <text start="244.68" dur="7.17">Corbyn is never going to work with them</text>
  <text start="248.07" dur="6.63">so did Johnson cave in it may seem like</text>
  <text start="251.85" dur="5.91">it was Johnson not Makran who caved in</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="5.4">but we have not seen the final extension</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="4.95">of the phone transcript alternatively</text>
  <text start="260.1" dur="4.47">and more likely Johnson has simply</text>
  <text start="262.71" dur="5.1">decided to gamble on elections running</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="6.599">on a get brexit done platform verse</text>
  <text start="267.81" dur="6.48">Corbin&amp;#39;s majority in that proposition of</text>
  <text start="271.169" dur="5.701">seeking a deal and campaigning against</text>
  <text start="274.29" dur="5.52">it I do believe that Johnson has the</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="5.729">upper hand right now an ID I do believe</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="5.76">that he is using this to his benefit to</text>
  <text start="282.599" dur="4.921">gain full and utter control through the</text>
  <text start="285.57" dur="2.81">elections we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this all</text>
  <text start="287.52" dur="3.17">plays out</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="5.76">but here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="290.69" dur="5.61">economic system that Trump has created</text>
  <text start="294.14" dur="4.08">and of course we know the difference</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="4.26">between a central bank manipulated</text>
  <text start="298.22" dur="4.59">system and a people&amp;#39;s economy Trump is</text>
  <text start="300.56" dur="4.71">using the central bank and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.81" dur="4.95">manipulated ways to make the economic</text>
  <text start="305.27" dur="4.23">system look fantastic meanwhile he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.76" dur="5.67">building the people system the other</text>
  <text start="309.5" dur="5.94">economy behind the scenes he tweeted out</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="5.16">the following the S&amp;amp;P just had an</text>
  <text start="315.44" dur="6.81">all-time high this is a big win for jobs</text>
  <text start="318.59" dur="4.59">401ks and frankly everyone our country</text>
  <text start="322.25" dur="4.02">is doing great</text>
  <text start="323.18" dur="4.14">even killed long-sought Isis murderer</text>
  <text start="326.27" dur="3.48">al-baghdadi</text>
  <text start="327.32" dur="5.52">we are stronger than ever before with</text>
  <text start="329.75" dur="6.72">great upward potential and joy now think</text>
  <text start="332.84" dur="7.08">about what he said 401 K s the stock</text>
  <text start="336.47" dur="6.24">market pensions and all that those are</text>
  <text start="339.92" dur="6.84">doing fine remember since the central</text>
  <text start="342.71" dur="6.9">bank has been lowering rates the pension</text>
  <text start="346.76" dur="5.67">systems they couldn&amp;#39;t get a return on</text>
  <text start="349.61" dur="5.37">their money they projected seven eight</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="4.71">percent return but with rates being</text>
  <text start="354.98" dur="4.68">lowered they couldn&amp;#39;t get that so they</text>
  <text start="357.14" dur="5.28">started to invest in the stock market to</text>
  <text start="359.66" dur="5.37">get those returns what is Trump doing</text>
  <text start="362.42" dur="6.75">right now he&amp;#39;s keeping the stock market</text>
  <text start="365.03" dur="7.38">up protecting the 401 K protecting the</text>
  <text start="369.17" dur="6.69">pension preparing the economic system</text>
  <text start="372.41" dur="8.28">for a transition into a new system now</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="7.62">we know that he&amp;#39;s been creating these</text>
  <text start="380.69" dur="6.03">new trade deals across the world making</text>
  <text start="383.48" dur="6.06">these fair trade deals and Trump said</text>
  <text start="386.72" dur="4.11">that negotiations for the so called</text>
  <text start="389.54" dur="4.07">phase one of the United States trade</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="5.34">deal with China were ahead of schedule</text>
  <text start="393.61" dur="4.78">we&amp;#39;re looking probably to be ahead of</text>
  <text start="396.17" dur="5.34">schedule to sign a very big portion of</text>
  <text start="398.39" dur="6.21">the China deal and we&amp;#39;ll call it phase</text>
  <text start="401.51" dur="5.37">one but it&amp;#39;s a very big portion he said</text>
  <text start="404.6" dur="3.69">that would take care of the farmers it</text>
  <text start="406.88" dur="4.38">would take care of some of the other</text>
  <text start="408.29" dur="6.24">things it will also take care of a lot</text>
  <text start="411.26" dur="5.43">of the banking needs and Trump is</text>
  <text start="414.53" dur="4.949">letting everyone know that we are headed</text>
  <text start="416.69" dur="3.83">down a path where things are looking a</text>
  <text start="419.479" dur="3.291">lot better</text>
  <text start="420.52" dur="4.41">now remember this is not a let better</text>
  <text start="422.77" dur="4.709">for the central bank system this is a</text>
  <text start="424.93" dur="4.47">lot better for the people system that</text>
  <text start="427.479" dur="4.981">will be moving into this is just like in</text>
  <text start="429.4" dur="4.62">71 prior to that we had Kissinger and</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="3.78">many others the central bank system</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="4.38">where they were creating the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="436.24" dur="4.41">system they were making deals in the</text>
  <text start="438.4" dur="4.949">Middle East they were making sure that</text>
  <text start="440.65" dur="4.68">everything was set up so in 71 when they</text>
  <text start="443.349" dur="4.831">took us off the gold standard they had a</text>
  <text start="445.33" dur="5.66">new system to move us onto now it was</text>
  <text start="448.18" dur="5.04">very bumpy a lot of people lost jobs</text>
  <text start="450.99" dur="4.45">there were long lines at the gas</text>
  <text start="453.22" dur="4.47">stations we saw a very high inflation</text>
  <text start="455.44" dur="4.68">and this is what you see when we go on</text>
  <text start="457.69" dur="4.259">to a full fiat system at the end of the</text>
  <text start="460.12" dur="4.889">Fiat system what do you see</text>
  <text start="461.949" dur="6.301">you don&amp;#39;t see the full inflation you see</text>
  <text start="465.009" dur="5.521">wages declining you see people not</text>
  <text start="468.25" dur="3.9">getting the high paying jobs you see a</text>
  <text start="470.53" dur="3.569">lot of people in debt</text>
  <text start="472.15" dur="5.069">you see college graduates finding it</text>
  <text start="474.099" dur="4.681">very difficult to get a job you see a</text>
  <text start="477.219" dur="4.23">lot of college graduates with a lot of</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="4.65">debt because of student loans this is</text>
  <text start="481.449" dur="4.77">what you see at the end stage at the</text>
  <text start="483.43" dur="4.59">beginning stage of a Fiat system yes you</text>
  <text start="486.219" dur="4.711">see inflation because once you take us</text>
  <text start="488.02" dur="6.179">off sound money the dollar loses value</text>
  <text start="490.93" dur="5.4">very very quickly it wasn&amp;#39;t because real</text>
  <text start="494.199" dur="4.62">estate was going up it wasn&amp;#39;t because</text>
  <text start="496.33" dur="4.739">your salary was going up it was because</text>
  <text start="498.819" dur="4.85">the dollar was losing value because they</text>
  <text start="501.069" dur="5.611">took us off of sound money and</text>
  <text start="503.669" dur="7.24">everything had to adjust so if your</text>
  <text start="506.68" dur="7.56">house went up and groceries went up your</text>
  <text start="510.909" dur="6.031">salary had to go up but when you&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="5.19">the end stage everything still goes up</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="5.519">but your wages don&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t keep up</text>
  <text start="519.43" dur="5.849">with the entire inflation the central</text>
  <text start="522.459" dur="5.431">bank model it it actually goes and</text>
  <text start="525.279" dur="5.761">reverse now and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="527.89" dur="6.17">and the central bank they realize that</text>
  <text start="531.04" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re kind of trapped here they</text>
  <text start="534.06" dur="7.06">they&amp;#39;re realizing that there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="536.62" dur="5.85">out for them remember latent August when</text>
  <text start="541.12" dur="4.17">we had former head of the New York Fed</text>
  <text start="542.47" dur="6.51">bill Dudley and he broke the golden rule</text>
  <text start="545.29" dur="6.6">of central banking elitism he crossed</text>
  <text start="548.98" dur="4.76">the line into politics arguing that</text>
  <text start="551.89" dur="3.62">there is even in</text>
  <text start="553.74" dur="5.64">argument that the Fed should crush the</text>
  <text start="555.51" dur="5.13">economy to remove Trump now this was</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="4.92">coming from a central bank the so</text>
  <text start="560.64" dur="9.9">desperate they were and he was calling</text>
  <text start="564.3" dur="9.84">on the central bank organization to shut</text>
  <text start="570.54" dur="6.9">down the economy just to remove Trump</text>
  <text start="574.14" dur="6.33">from office destroy people&amp;#39;s pensions</text>
  <text start="577.44" dur="4.74">destroy people&amp;#39;s wealth destroy</text>
  <text start="580.47" dur="5.97">everything that people have worked for</text>
  <text start="582.18" dur="9.47">just to remove the president I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.44" dur="7.83">just unbelievable now six weeks later</text>
  <text start="591.65" dur="5.53">Dudley appears to have flip-flop</text>
  <text start="594.27" dur="6.63">completely urging the Fed to cut rates</text>
  <text start="597.18" dur="6.63">as an insurance against an imminent</text>
  <text start="600.9" dur="5.04">recession the exact recession that he</text>
  <text start="603.81" dur="5.58">had previously willed into being to</text>
  <text start="605.94" dur="6.9">remove Trump now let&amp;#39;s think about this</text>
  <text start="609.39" dur="6.63">for a second why would he reverse his</text>
  <text start="612.84" dur="6.27">decision because they&amp;#39;re trapped right</text>
  <text start="616.02" dur="7.14">now Trump has been blaming the Fed from</text>
  <text start="619.11" dur="7.59">the very beginning saying if the economy</text>
  <text start="623.16" dur="6.78">goes down it will be the Federal</text>
  <text start="626.7" dur="6.87">Reserve&amp;#39;s fault period because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="629.94" dur="5.49">not doing what I say and every time back</text>
  <text start="633.57" dur="3.54">in 2019 when they raise the rates what</text>
  <text start="635.43" dur="2.63">happened to the stock market it went</text>
  <text start="637.11" dur="6.6">down</text>
  <text start="638.06" dur="7.81">real estate took a hit and what happened</text>
  <text start="643.71" dur="6.81">when they lowered rates the market moved</text>
  <text start="645.87" dur="8.91">up real estate improved and the economy</text>
  <text start="650.52" dur="6.3">didn&amp;#39;t crash and if you look you can see</text>
  <text start="654.78" dur="4.83">the market is definitely moving up and</text>
  <text start="656.82" dur="5.55">the central bankers and the deep stay in</text>
  <text start="659.61" dur="4.26">the mainstream media they know if Trump</text>
  <text start="662.37" dur="4.14">gets what he wants</text>
  <text start="663.87" dur="4.98">he gets the additional rate cuts and</text>
  <text start="666.51" dur="6.54">remember we have to hit a certain point</text>
  <text start="668.85" dur="6.54">before the full effect is seen so Trump</text>
  <text start="673.05" dur="4.23">has to continually hit the fed and tell</text>
  <text start="675.39" dur="4.23">them another rate cut another rate cut</text>
  <text start="677.28" dur="5.19">another rate cut at the same time needs</text>
  <text start="679.62" dur="4.86">the Fed to start stimulus add more</text>
  <text start="682.47" dur="4.08">stimulus add more stimulus in at a</text>
  <text start="684.48" dur="2.849">certain point all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="686.55" dur="2.279">economy&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="687.329" dur="4.05">take off now he&amp;#39;s doing this very very</text>
  <text start="688.829" dur="5.61">slowly in 2019 and I think once we hit</text>
  <text start="691.379" dur="4.95">2020 probably the end of the first</text>
