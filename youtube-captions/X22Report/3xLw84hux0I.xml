  <text start="43.81" dur="5.88">begin its collapse this fall let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="47.5" dur="5.55">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="49.69" dur="5.63">news now as we can see more more</text>
  <text start="53.05" dur="4.47">corporations they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="55.32" dur="3.66">thousands upon thousands of people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="57.52" dur="4.65">not just hundreds of people anymore</text>
  <text start="58.98" dur="5.29">we&amp;#39;re getting to a point in time where</text>
  <text start="62.17" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;re going to see more corporations</text>
  <text start="64.27" dur="4.5">come forward where they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="66.04" dur="3.63">laying off a lot more people cisco</text>
  <text start="68.77" dur="2.52">announced that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="69.67" dur="5.24">cutting between nine to fourteen</text>
  <text start="71.29" dur="6.689">thousand jobs worldwide and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="74.91" dur="8.16">seasonally adjusted it&amp;#39;s about 20,000</text>
  <text start="77.979" dur="8.041">people and that is a lot of people</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="5.77">because you really think about it since</text>
  <text start="86.02" dur="5.58">the beginning of this year we have had</text>
  <text start="88.84" dur="6.96">hundreds of thousands of people lose</text>
  <text start="91.6" dur="7.859">their job but the claims they&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="95.8" dur="5.61">all-time lows I guess everyone losing</text>
  <text start="99.459" dur="6.211">their jobs they&amp;#39;re just finding jobs</text>
  <text start="101.41" dur="6.81">very quickly well how can they because</text>
  <text start="105.67" dur="4.41">if you really think about it when the</text>
  <text start="108.22" dur="3.87">tech company lays off other tech</text>
  <text start="110.08" dur="4.379">companies are laying off where do the</text>
  <text start="112.09" dur="3.839">people go when financial companies are</text>
  <text start="114.459" dur="3.811">laying off other financial companies are</text>
  <text start="115.929" dur="7.491">laying off where do the people go this</text>
  <text start="118.27" dur="7.739">is why we see a huge part time economy</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="4.509">appearing right now because many people</text>
  <text start="126.009" dur="4.381">can&amp;#39;t find that job they&amp;#39;re taking one</text>
  <text start="127.929" dur="6.151">two part-time jobs and we also have to</text>
  <text start="130.39" dur="6.72">remember the BLS counts that as one job</text>
  <text start="134.08" dur="5.4">two jobs three full-time jobs so if</text>
  <text start="137.11" dur="4.53">somebody has to a three part time they</text>
  <text start="139.48" dur="5.25">have about two or three full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="141.64" dur="5.78">and this is how they manipulate</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="6.36">everything but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="6.52">retail giants like Target they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="151.09" dur="4.95">slashing their earning estimates now</text>
  <text start="153.94" dur="5.67">this is really not a shock we realize</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="7.29">that the retail industry is suffering it</text>
  <text start="159.61" dur="4.74">is contracting declining and we can see</text>
  <text start="163.33" dur="3.48">right now</text>
  <text start="164.35" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re blaming this on a challenging</text>
  <text start="166.81" dur="6.75">environment in the back half of this</text>
  <text start="170.65" dur="6.69">year it&amp;#39;s funny how they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="173.56" dur="7.91">admit the economy is the problem first</text>
  <text start="177.34" dur="6.42">it was the weather too snowy to sunny</text>
  <text start="181.47" dur="3.91">they can&amp;#39;t use that excuse anymore</text>
  <text start="183.76" dur="5.15">because every time the earnings come out</text>
  <text start="185.38" dur="6.78">every time the sales report comes out</text>
  <text start="188.91" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s continually declining so what do</text>
  <text start="192.16" dur="4.35">you say because it&amp;#39;s sunny all the time</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="5.86">this is why retail sales are failing</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="6.32">it&amp;#39;s cold out this is why retail sales</text>
  <text start="199.69" dur="5.34">of hung it that excuse no longer works</text>
  <text start="202.83" dur="5.86">but they can&amp;#39;t blame it on the economy</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="5.78">so they have to make other weight they</text>
  <text start="208.69" dur="4.71">have to think of other ways of</text>
  <text start="210.81" dur="6.22">explaining and explaining away why this</text>
  <text start="213.4" dur="6.06">is happening and they use terms like</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="5.13">challenging environment which really</text>
  <text start="219.46" dur="5.58">means the economy is failing we see</text>
  <text start="222.16" dur="6.54">Apple products which normally does very</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="6.15">very well they&amp;#39;re having troubles their</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="5.43">sales are down twenty percent in the</text>
  <text start="231.19" dur="7.89">second quarter this just goes to show</text>
  <text start="234.13" dur="7.46">you that it&amp;#39;s hitting every company now</text>
  <text start="239.08" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s very interesting is that home depot</text>
  <text start="241.59" dur="7.11">they came out and said ha sales are</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="6.39">incredible look home ownership must be</text>
  <text start="248.7" dur="4.75">fantastic people must be buying houses</text>
  <text start="250.9" dur="4.59">because the sales in Home Depot are up</text>
  <text start="253.45" dur="5.73">and then we see lows on the other hand</text>
  <text start="255.49" dur="5.49">where their sales are declining we have</text>
  <text start="259.18" dur="4.86">two opposite things happening right now</text>
  <text start="260.98" dur="6.42">if the housing industry is so incredible</text>
  <text start="264.04" dur="8.82">why aren&amp;#39;t both showing an improvement</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="7.17">why only one store it&amp;#39;s very odd but</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="4.1">when we look at the real estate market</text>
  <text start="274.57" dur="6.48">and this is very important because</text>
  <text start="276.96" dur="8.5">people gauge how they&amp;#39;re doing in the</text>
  <text start="281.05" dur="5.7">economy by how housing is doing and the</text>
  <text start="285.46" dur="3.51">US government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="286.75" dur="4.92">realizes they understand this is what</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="6.81">people look at if people see housing</text>
  <text start="291.67" dur="5.68">prices dropping their investments being</text>
  <text start="295.78" dur="3.85">chipped away</text>
  <text start="297.35" dur="4.83">everyone gets nervous what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="299.63" dur="5.13">with the economy if housing prices are</text>
  <text start="302.18" dur="7.53">moving up people believe that the</text>
  <text start="304.76" dur="6.6">economy is still strong well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="309.71" dur="3.09">seeing a lot of problems usually when</text>
  <text start="311.36" dur="3.75">the housing prices are moving up so</text>
  <text start="312.8" dur="5.34">quickly we have problems where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="6.26">called a bubble when we see housing</text>
  <text start="318.14" dur="6.45">prices moving up in certain areas only</text>
  <text start="321.37" dur="5.14">that is a control bubble and that is by</text>
  <text start="324.59" dur="4.08">the central bank and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="326.51" dur="5.82">what we&amp;#39;re seeing because every single</text>
  <text start="328.67" dur="6.69">area is not seeing prices increase</text>
  <text start="332.33" dur="4.68">actually case-shiller the United States</text>
  <text start="335.36" dur="4.23">government central bankers look at</text>
  <text start="337.01" dur="4.59">around 20 cities they can control about</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="3.63">20 cities but they can&amp;#39;t control the</text>
  <text start="341.6" dur="3.87">entire country it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="5.64">difficult to do that and this is why we</text>
  <text start="345.47" dur="5.94">see a discrepancy in certain areas where</text>
  <text start="348.86" dur="4.71">we see hmmm if we look at San Francisco</text>
  <text start="351.41" dur="4.5">we see prices going up if we look at</text>
  <text start="353.57" dur="7.32">another area in the United States we see</text>
  <text start="355.91" dur="6.81">prices moving downward because they</text>
  <text start="360.89" dur="3.45">can&amp;#39;t control the area and the only</text>
  <text start="362.72" dur="3.63">report on those areas that they can</text>
  <text start="364.34" dur="3.96">control showing you and trying to prove</text>
  <text start="366.35" dur="5.7">to you that the real estate market is</text>
  <text start="368.3" dur="5.52">doing well but back in June we listed</text>
  <text start="372.05" dur="4.68">many different warnings that the housing</text>
  <text start="373.82" dur="5.64">market is slowing and falling apart now</text>
  <text start="376.73" dur="7.53">realtytrac senior vice president Darren</text>
  <text start="379.46" dur="7.2">bloom quest well he was out there saying</text>
  <text start="384.26" dur="6.09">that there are problems in the housing</text>
  <text start="386.66" dur="7.5">market now he referred to house flipping</text>
  <text start="390.35" dur="7.89">by third-party investors and this was</text>
  <text start="394.16" dur="6.69">back but there&amp;#39;s a problem the share of</text>

  <text start="408.26" dur="7.65">in 2007 going into 2008 the second</text>
  <text start="412.25" dur="5.79">warning came as a result of the latest</text>
