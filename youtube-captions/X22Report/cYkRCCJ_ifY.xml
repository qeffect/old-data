  <text start="52.71" dur="6.8">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="6.53">rapport my name is dave in this episode</text>
  <text start="59.51" dur="6.16">1442 bien today&amp;#39;s date is December 7th</text>
  <text start="63.17" dur="7.27">2017 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.67" dur="6.93">the global reset has begun let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="70.44" dur="5.52">into the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.6" dur="6.059">geopolitical news now as we know the US</text>
  <text start="75.96" dur="4.799">has bases all around the world and it</text>
  <text start="78.659" dur="5.1">kind of looks very similar to the Roman</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="4.711">Empire where they invaded countries they</text>
  <text start="83.759" dur="3.601">set up bases they put in puppet</text>
  <text start="85.47" dur="5.91">governments and they controlled</text>
  <text start="87.36" dur="6.81">everything through force and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="5.489">seeing right now is that these forces</text>
  <text start="94.17" dur="5.369">well they&amp;#39;re being asked to leave by</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="5.161">certain countries and there&amp;#39;s a report</text>
  <text start="99.539" dur="4.771">coming out of the Pentagon where the US</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="4.199">military has more than 44,000 troops</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="7.11">across the globe that the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="106.229" dur="7.92">claims it cannot track now this is very</text>
  <text start="111.42" dur="5.22">interesting because we know that cabal</text>
  <text start="114.149" dur="4.711">uses troops and they have certain</text>
  <text start="116.64" dur="4.68">factions within the Pentagon where they</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="4.71">deploy them without anyone really</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="3.99">knowing what they&amp;#39;re doing and they use</text>
  <text start="123.57" dur="4.919">a lot of paid mercenaries also for those</text>
  <text start="125.31" dur="5.58">contractors and whatnot and we see this</text>
  <text start="128.489" dur="4.981">is coming from Army colonel Rob Manning</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="5.04">a Pentagon a pentagon spokesman saying</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="4.35">that listen we are not at a point where</text>
  <text start="135.93" dur="4.589">we can give numbers other than those</text>
  <text start="137.82" dur="6.15">officially stated of we&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="140.519" dur="6.541">these troops are because we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="143.97" dur="7.23">exactly where they are so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="5.97">labeled unknown and we know that certain</text>
  <text start="151.2" dur="4.08">troops are being sent in to certain</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="5.31">areas and it looks like they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="5.67">to account for these troops it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="158.34" dur="5.1">like the trillions of dollars that go</text>
  <text start="160.95" dur="5.789">missing in the Pentagon nobody knows</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="5.73">where when no where is it listed in the</text>
  <text start="166.739" dur="3.691">accounting records nobody knows anything</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s the same thing with the troops</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="6.089">because over the many many years the</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="6.33">cabal had control they basically used</text>
  <text start="176.519" dur="6.84">certain troops they used certain funds</text>
  <text start="179.22" dur="6.03">to push operations overseas and this is</text>
  <text start="183.359" dur="2.741">why when we look at all the information</text>
  <text start="185.25" dur="3.46">we see</text>
  <text start="186.1" dur="5.4">that they have no record of any of this</text>
  <text start="188.71" dur="5.25">type of stuff we see the sanctions on</text>
  <text start="191.5" dur="4.8">North Korea well they might not be</text>
  <text start="193.96" dur="5.22">having that much of an effect like the</text>
  <text start="196.3" dur="5.7">US would like to believe because we can</text>
  <text start="199.18" dur="6.33">see that North Korea is using indirect</text>
  <text start="202" dur="7.73">channels for exports now North Korea has</text>
  <text start="205.51" dur="8.25">been using these indirect channels to</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="6.61">basically sell coal and for years the</text>
  <text start="213.76" dur="5.61">coal trade has been very lucrative for</text>
  <text start="216.34" dur="5.31">North Korea its main ally and key</text>
  <text start="219.37" dur="4.2">economic partner is China which imports</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="5.73">about 22 million tons worth nearly what</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="5.88">about 1.2 billion in 2016 but while</text>
  <text start="227.38" dur="4.77">Beijing says North Korea imports have</text>
  <text start="229.45" dur="5.64">come to a halt race and Kong trans</text>
  <text start="232.15" dur="6.33">business is booming since starting</text>
  <text start="235.09" dur="7.08">operations in 2015 its volume well</text>
  <text start="238.48" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;ve doubled each year and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="5.49">lot of women working the cranes there we</text>
  <text start="245.14" dur="5.43">see there&amp;#39;s a target of about 3 million</text>
  <text start="247.66" dur="4.89">tons next year and a lot of this is</text>
  <text start="250.57" dur="4.97">being shipped off to Russia and to many</text>
  <text start="252.55" dur="7.11">other countries and it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="7.99">bypassing the sanctions and we know that</text>
  <text start="259.66" dur="9">North Korea is also pushing the opium</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="6.63">trade which competes with the CIA where</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="4.16">they have their poppy fields in</text>
  <text start="270.16" dur="5.34">Afghanistan they don&amp;#39;t like this and</text>
  <text start="272.82" dur="7.66">countries will always get around</text>
  <text start="275.5" dur="8.07">sanctions one way or another and we see</text>
  <text start="280.48" dur="4.77">many countries are moving towards crypto</text>
  <text start="283.57" dur="3.6">currencies like Venezuela they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="285.25" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re gonna create the petrol or they</text>
  <text start="287.17" dur="3.48">drop the dollar and they deal with do</text>
  <text start="289.03" dur="3.9">they deal with other countries</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="5.04">currencies and they say we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="292.93" dur="4.95">the dollar but what we can see over the</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="5.85">many many years is that sanctions</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="7.8">haven&amp;#39;t worked look at Iran look at Cuba</text>
  <text start="301.54" dur="7.41">look at Syria look at Russia look at all</text>
  <text start="305.68" dur="8.13">these different countries they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="308.95" dur="7.77">folded and said ok we give you win it</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="5.17">never happens so we can see that</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="6.31">sanctions aren&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="318.98" dur="6.3">we see a Russian lawmaker is saying that</text>
  <text start="323.03" dur="5.01">North Korea&amp;#39;s ambassador to Russia said</text>
  <text start="325.28" dur="4.38">on Thursday that North Korea did not</text>
  <text start="328.04" dur="3.3">want to escalate tensions with the</text>
  <text start="329.66" dur="5.73">United States and they would like to</text>
  <text start="331.34" dur="8.22">have some type of conference some type</text>
  <text start="335.39" dur="5.91">of talk to discuss the issues now again</text>
  <text start="339.56" dur="3.87">North Korea is trying to become a</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="4.59">nuclear power they want to be recognized</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="5.19">as the nuclear power and once they are a</text>
  <text start="345.89" dur="7.08">nuclear power the IAEA would come in and</text>
  <text start="348.62" dur="6.93">inspect and the Cabal would have really</text>
  <text start="352.97" dur="4.26">no chance of going in and having regime</text>
  <text start="355.55" dur="3.87">change and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="357.23" dur="5.16">pushing so hard to become a nuclear</text>
  <text start="359.42" dur="6.03">state and this is why I do believe that</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="6.42">China Russia even the US and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="365.45" dur="7.08">talking about the Cabal is allowing the</text>
  <text start="368.81" dur="5.7">time for North Korea to become a nuclear</text>
  <text start="372.53" dur="4.53">state that can just really put this</text>
  <text start="374.51" dur="4.5">whole thing to bed and say listen their</text>
  <text start="377.06" dur="4.77">nuclear state right now there&amp;#39;ll be no</text>
  <text start="379.01" dur="5.1">regime change here and we know that</text>
  <text start="381.83" dur="5.01">Russia and China they&amp;#39;re not gonna let a</text>
  <text start="384.11" dur="4.23">War break out right on their border even</text>
  <text start="386.84" dur="3.21">though they think that the Cabal might</text>
  <text start="388.34" dur="4.92">try to some type of an event which they</text>
  <text start="390.05" dur="5.99">still might they realize they need to</text>
  <text start="393.26" dur="5.43">keep the peace in this area we know that</text>
  <text start="396.04" dur="4.66">Trump he already announced and we</text>
  <text start="398.69" dur="3.78">discussed this yesterday where Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="400.7" dur="3.63">is going to be the capital of Israel and</text>
  <text start="402.47" dur="4.44">we see many countries are out there</text>
  <text start="404.33" dur="4.77">saying that you know this is going to be</text>
  <text start="406.91" dur="5.13">a huge problem now maybe it will be</text>
  <text start="409.1" dur="6.36">maybe it won&amp;#39;t be I do believe that</text>
  <text start="412.04" dur="6.72">there was some type of deal made behind</text>
  <text start="415.46" dur="5.01">the scenes where we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="418.76" dur="5.07">things change in the Middle East but</text>
  <text start="420.47" dur="6.48">rwan is out there and he lashed out at</text>
  <text start="423.83" dur="4.8">Trump and his decision to recognize</text>
  <text start="426.95" dur="4.11">Jerusalem as the capital of Israel</text>
  <text start="428.63" dur="7.41">saying it would put the region in a ring</text>
  <text start="431.06" dur="8.46">of fire and he&amp;#39;s saying that this is not</text>
  <text start="436.04" dur="5.34">going to be a good situation here and we</text>
  <text start="439.52" dur="4.11">can see there&amp;#39;s protests already being</text>
  <text start="441.38" dur="4.62">ramped up and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see</text>
  <text start="443.63" dur="4.59">how this all plays out now I see two</text>
  <text start="446" dur="5.01">different scenarios that could happen</text>
  <text start="448.22" dur="4.41">with this one Trump talked to all the</text>
  <text start="451.01" dur="4.41">leaders around the area the</text>
  <text start="452.63" dur="4.86">region and they discussed what was going</text>
  <text start="455.42" dur="4.52">to happen here they discussed with</text>
  <text start="457.49" dur="5.7">Israel they discussed everything and</text>
  <text start="459.94" dur="7.72">Israel made a deal with the United</text>
  <text start="463.19" dur="7.2">States to lay off of Syria and stop the</text>
  <text start="467.66" dur="4.89">war with Iran and they made some type of</text>
  <text start="470.39" dur="6.18">deal where there&amp;#39;d be peace in the</text>
  <text start="472.55" dur="8.49">region the other scenario is that this</text>
  <text start="476.57" dur="7.14">was done for the event where they would</text>
  <text start="481.04" dur="5.28">want the Middle East to blow up and a</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="5.48">war would break out in this entire area</text>
  <text start="486.32" dur="5.85">and bring in Russia and China and</text>
  <text start="489.19" dur="6.4">basically bring us into World War 3 now</text>
  <text start="492.17" dur="6.33">do I think this is what was done no I</text>
  <text start="495.59" dur="4.53">think it was a deal that was made</text>
  <text start="498.5" dur="5.4">because we can see already right now</text>
  <text start="500.12" dur="6.03">that Syria has fallen Libya</text>
  <text start="503.9" dur="4.14">well there&amp;#39;s no chance of anything</text>
  <text start="506.15" dur="4.53">happening there Russia is moving in</text>
  <text start="508.04" dur="4.499">China is moving in Lebanon you can see</text>
  <text start="510.68" dur="3.81">that there&amp;#39;s no way they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="512.539" dur="4.621">pushing a war with Iran Iran is not</text>
  <text start="514.49" dur="6.12">ready to go into a war or start a war</text>
  <text start="517.16" dur="4.23">and with North Korea that&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="520.61" dur="2.58">different story</text>
  <text start="521.39" dur="4.97">where that is going to go absolutely</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="5.49">nowhere but we see the State Department</text>
  <text start="526.36" dur="3.94">they&amp;#39;re warning Americans they are in</text>
  <text start="528.68" dur="6.39">danger for a terror attacks worldwide</text>
  <text start="530.3" dur="7.11">because of what Trump has done now the</text>
  <text start="535.07" dur="3.75">corporate media and everyone else is out</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="4.65">there saying that this is going to start</text>
  <text start="538.82" dur="5.43">a war worldwide now of course whenever I</text>
  <text start="542.06" dur="3.63">see this and I see the corporate media</text>
  <text start="544.25" dur="4.17">and everyone talking about how this is</text>
  <text start="545.69" dur="4.41">going to start war and all these</text>
  <text start="548.42" dur="4.77">countries are going to get into a war I</text>
  <text start="550.1" dur="5.31">think the opposite just like they said</text>
  <text start="553.19" dur="4.11">North Korea with his nuclear missile</text>
  <text start="555.41" dur="4.35">systems this is going to start a war</text>
  <text start="557.3" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re on the edge of war no the only</text>
  <text start="559.76" dur="5.13">reason we&amp;#39;d be on edge of war is if the</text>
  <text start="561.8" dur="5.52">Cabal has some type of false flag and</text>
  <text start="564.89" dur="4.62">brought us into a war North Korea is not</text>
  <text start="567.32" dur="4.35">going to attack anyone the same thing</text>
  <text start="569.51" dur="5.22">with Syria where they talk when if you</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="6.51">go back in time they told us that it</text>
  <text start="574.73" dur="5.64">would take years and years and years to</text>
  <text start="578.18" dur="5.01">get rid of the Islamic state there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.37" dur="5.82">just no possible way they could be</text>
  <text start="583.19" dur="3.24">beaten they&amp;#39;re just too strong well how</text>
  <text start="586.19" dur="2.64">come</text>
  <text start="586.43" dur="3.5">Russia can come right in and would it</text>
  <text start="588.83" dur="4.949">take him a year and a half</text>
  <text start="589.93" dur="6.49">no that was propaganda again what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="593.779" dur="5.221">seeing right now about a war breaking</text>
  <text start="596.42" dur="5.52">out in this area it seems to me that</text>
  <text start="599" dur="4.83">this once again is propaganda because</text>
  <text start="601.94" dur="4.94">they don&amp;#39;t like what is happening here</text>
  <text start="603.83" dur="5.61">they don&amp;#39;t want peace they want war</text>
  <text start="606.88" dur="6.69">their whole objective from the beginning</text>
  <text start="609.44" dur="7.2">was to start a war because if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="613.57" dur="5.829">guess what the central bank is doomed</text>
  <text start="616.64" dur="5.04">the Cabal is doomed their plans are</text>
  <text start="619.399" dur="5.521">doomed so they&amp;#39;re gonna tell you that</text>
  <text start="621.68" dur="5.43">this is going to incite war everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="624.92" dur="4.14">gonna come out and start fighting and</text>
  <text start="627.11" dur="3.51">remember whatever the central bank</text>
  <text start="629.06" dur="3.029">whatever these government officials the</text>
  <text start="630.62" dur="4.11">corporate media tells you it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="632.089" dur="6.391">the opposite it&amp;#39;s always the opposite of</text>
  <text start="634.73" dur="6.33">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and it&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="638.48" dur="6.45">back to Russian collusion who really</text>
  <text start="641.06" dur="7.529">colluded who was really taking funds who</text>
  <text start="644.93" dur="6.06">was really doing things illegally think</text>
  <text start="648.589" dur="3.931">about it for a second this is why they</text>
  <text start="650.99" dur="4.8">couldn&amp;#39;t prove anything because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="652.52" dur="7.53">really about them what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="655.79" dur="6">doing and we can see that the whole</text>
  <text start="660.05" dur="5.729">thing&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart and come</text>
  <text start="661.79" dur="5.07">down around them now Russia is saying</text>
  <text start="665.779" dur="3.93">that they&amp;#39;re ready to work with the</text>
  <text start="666.86" dur="5.55">United States to demolish the Islamic</text>
  <text start="669.709" dur="6.331">state in Iraq let&amp;#39;s wrap this up because</text>
  <text start="672.41" dur="4.23">we have eliminated the Islamic state in</text>
  <text start="676.04" dur="2.07">Syria</text>
  <text start="676.64" dur="4.05">yeah there&amp;#39;s little pockets here and</text>
  <text start="678.11" dur="4.32">there but they&amp;#39;ll be gone before the end</text>
  <text start="680.69" dur="4.019">of the year and when we looked at the</text>
  <text start="682.43" dur="6.27">situation back in September October we</text>
  <text start="684.709" dur="6.091">said by December guess what the Islamic</text>
  <text start="688.7" dur="5.85">state would be eradicated from Syria and</text>
  <text start="690.8" dur="5.789">here we are in December and Russia and</text>
  <text start="694.55" dur="4.229">Syria they&amp;#39;re going to be joining the</text>
  <text start="696.589" dur="4.471">Geneva peace talks now of course the</text>
  <text start="698.779" dur="5.911">United States is saying yes we&amp;#39;ll allow</text>
  <text start="701.06" dur="6.51">Assad to be included in the peace talks</text>

  <text start="844.01" dur="3.51">yes we have 2,000 troops or something</text>
  <text start="846.5" dur="3.78">like that I think there&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="847.52" dur="4.62">there but we see the numbers are moving</text>
  <text start="850.28" dur="3.39">in the opposite direction they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="852.14" dur="1.95">removing the troops from these areas</text>
  <text start="853.67" dur="2.28">because</text>

  <text start="860.42" dur="5.4">not eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="862.97" dur="5.07">and we can see hurt already because the</text>
  <text start="865.82" dur="4.59">the Syrian government the Russian</text>
  <text start="868.04" dur="5.28">government already tested the waters and</text>
  <text start="870.41" dur="4.65">said you know we want the u.s. to leave</text>
  <text start="873.32" dur="4.05">they wanted to see how the US was going</text>
  <text start="875.06" dur="4.74">to react and the u.s. already started to</text>
  <text start="877.37" dur="4.92">remove about 400 soldiers so we can see</text>
  <text start="879.8" dur="6">the process has already begun we see</text>
  <text start="882.29" dur="5.55">right now that Lavrov well he agreed</text>
  <text start="885.8" dur="4.8">with Tillerson on the necessity of</text>
  <text start="887.84" dur="8.64">resuming interest syria talks without</text>
  <text start="890.6" dur="8.49">preconditions which means Russia Syria</text>
  <text start="896.48" dur="7.44">they have the upper hand they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="899.09" dur="8.34">to be dictating what they want and the</text>

  <text start="907.43" dur="7.28">global reset has already started you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="911.96" dur="5.73">seeing it unfold in front of your eyes</text>
  <text start="914.71" dur="5.71">the corporate media is keeping everyone</text>
  <text start="917.69" dur="6.36">busy with everything else and what this</text>
  <text start="920.42" dur="6.81">means is that as Russia and China get</text>
  <text start="924.05" dur="5.67">more and more power as they take control</text>
  <text start="927.23" dur="6.81">over these areas and make more military</text>
  <text start="929.72" dur="6.42">deals make more economic deals make more</text>
  <text start="934.04" dur="4.38">deals bilateral trade agreements with</text>
  <text start="936.14" dur="4.53">all these countries and the belton road</text>
  <text start="938.42" dur="4.29">and all the projects the bridges and all</text>
  <text start="940.67" dur="4.8">the passageways and everything gets</text>
  <text start="942.71" dur="5.07">completed and it becomes operational in</text>
  <text start="945.47" dur="4.95">China takes their investments and put</text>
  <text start="947.78" dur="5.76">more into the one belt one Road we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="950.42" dur="7.23">going to see everything change and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="953.54" dur="7.08">already changing and right now we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="957.65" dur="5.4">the beginning stage of this global reset</text>
  <text start="960.62" dur="4.74">and if you haven&amp;#39;t listened to the</text>
  <text start="963.05" dur="4.5">interview with jim willie go on to the</text>
  <text start="965.36" dur="4.02">x-22 report spotlight YouTube channel</text>
  <text start="967.55" dur="4.35">listen because we talked about the dual</text>
  <text start="969.38" dur="4.89">universe with depetro yuyuan and the</text>
  <text start="971.9" dur="6.69">petrodollar yes the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="974.27" dur="7.29">well that is the most widely used form</text>
  <text start="978.59" dur="4.47">of payment for oil the Petra Juan is in</text>
  <text start="981.56" dur="3.81">the beginning stages but eventually</text>
  <text start="983.06" dur="3.75">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the Petra Juan</text>
  <text start="985.37" dur="2.46">is going to take over from the</text>
  <text start="986.81" dur="2.25">petrodollar</text>
  <text start="987.83" dur="3.57">the petrodollar is gonna be used less</text>
  <text start="989.06" dur="4.59">and less and less and we understand that</text>
  <text start="991.4" dur="3.96">the central banks are controlling all of</text>
  <text start="993.65" dur="3.84">this this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the central</text>
  <text start="995.36" dur="5.1">banks are gone this means they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="997.49" dur="4.86">their base of operation to a different</text>
  <text start="1000.46" dur="3.48">country this is why they set up</text>
  <text start="1002.35" dur="3.63">manufacturing this is why they</text>
  <text start="1003.94" dur="4.11">duplicated everything we are at the</text>
  <text start="1005.98" dur="5.07">beginning stages and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1008.05" dur="5.73">accelerate in the year of 2018 2019 and</text>
  <text start="1011.05" dur="4.05">what they&amp;#39;re waiting for is some type of</text>
  <text start="1013.78" dur="3.06">an event because they just don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1015.1" dur="3.63">switch it over because people are gonna</text>
  <text start="1016.84" dur="3.75">say well why are we switching over to a</text>
  <text start="1018.73" dur="4.71">new system went out into the old system</text>
  <text start="1020.59" dur="5.55">did your old system not work this is why</text>
  <text start="1023.44" dur="4.29">they need some type of an event and I</text>
  <text start="1026.14" dur="5.01">believe they&amp;#39;re gonna continually push</text>
  <text start="1027.73" dur="6.03">for some type of an event to distract</text>
  <text start="1031.15" dur="4.559">from what they&amp;#39;re trying to do here now</text>
  <text start="1033.76" dur="3.51">is it going to work we don&amp;#39;t know as of</text>
  <text start="1035.709" dur="6.691">yet because we can see their whole</text>
  <text start="1037.27" dur="7.02">system is being ripped apart and the the</text>
  <text start="1042.4" dur="5.37">faction the Cabal that they were using</text>
  <text start="1044.29" dur="5.67">to create this event no longer exists so</text>
  <text start="1047.77" dur="4.74">either the central bank is going to have</text>
  <text start="1049.96" dur="4.64">trouble right now forces are going to be</text>
  <text start="1052.51" dur="6.6">pushed against the central bank and</text>
  <text start="1054.6" dur="6.67">maybe going forward we can use this to</text>
  <text start="1059.11" dur="4.47">get rid of the central bank but we see</text>
  <text start="1061.27" dur="5.19">that this is a tough period of time</text>
  <text start="1063.58" dur="4.95">right now and the reset they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="1066.46" dur="3.96">pushing forward we&amp;#39;re just going to have</text>
  <text start="1068.53" dur="4.5">to see how this all plays out and what</text>
  <text start="1070.42" dur="5.28">this means is is that the economy of the</text>
  <text start="1073.03" dur="6.26">United States is going to change rapidly</text>
  <text start="1075.7" dur="7.14">because everything is being moved and</text>
  <text start="1079.29" dur="7.63">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see how quickly this</text>
  <text start="1082.84" dur="6.27">move is made during the next year or two</text>
  <text start="1086.92" dur="6.63">years because what they really wanted</text>
  <text start="1089.11" dur="7.17">was a war a huge distraction to distract</text>
  <text start="1093.55" dur="5.31">and reduce the population of course so</text>
  <text start="1096.28" dur="3.69">they can make the move now without this</text>
  <text start="1098.86" dur="1.68">distraction if they don&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="1099.97" dur="2.55">distraction</text>
  <text start="1100.54" dur="2.88">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna blame the central bank</text>
  <text start="1102.52" dur="3.54">and I don&amp;#39;t know how they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="1103.42" dur="4.89">able to push this to make it look like</text>
  <text start="1106.06" dur="3.45">they need this new system and this is</text>
  <text start="1108.31" dur="2.91">why they&amp;#39;re worried about crypto</text>
  <text start="1109.51" dur="3.75">currencies because the world is looking</text>
  <text start="1111.22" dur="3.9">at crypto currencies saying okay we</text>
  <text start="1113.26" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t need a bank we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="1115.12" dur="7.02">central bank people can issue these</text>
  <text start="1118.9" dur="7.83">currency without a centralized for</text>
  <text start="1122.14" dur="6">so why don&amp;#39;t we just use this and we see</text>
  <text start="1126.73" dur="5.16">right now that the central bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="1128.14" dur="6.63">don&amp;#39;t want this because they need to be</text>
  <text start="1131.89" dur="5.07">in control because with cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="1134.77" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s no interest attached to this</text>
  <text start="1136.96" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s no centralized force issuing it</text>
  <text start="1140.17" dur="3.99">and this is something they definitely</text>
  <text start="1142.72" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t want and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1144.16" dur="4.65">trying to control it now gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1146.68" dur="4.22">it&amp;#39;s still important because this</text>
  <text start="1148.81" dur="5.34">ensures your wealth against inflation</text>
  <text start="1150.9" dur="7.18">against the dollar dying you&amp;#39;ll use this</text>
  <text start="1154.15" dur="7.05">to purchase cryptocurrency or any other</text>
  <text start="1158.08" dur="5.61">currency that is created because gold</text>
  <text start="1161.2" dur="4.29">and silver maintains its value it has</text>
  <text start="1163.69" dur="4.86">over thousands and thousands of years</text>
  <text start="1165.49" dur="4.55">the only reason you see gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1168.55" dur="4.32">so low right now is because they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1170.04" dur="4.72">manipulating the entire market but when</text>
  <text start="1172.87" dur="4.95">the manipulation stops that will</text>
  <text start="1174.76" dur="5.28">disappear like it always does and those</text>
  <text start="1177.82" dur="6.12">people who have gold and silver will win</text>
  <text start="1180.04" dur="6">out think about 1929 1930s when the</text>
  <text start="1183.94" dur="5.22">government said you must give us your</text>
  <text start="1186.04" dur="5.28">gold and gold was you know $20 an ounce</text>
  <text start="1189.16" dur="6.3">at the time once the government had the</text>
  <text start="1191.32" dur="5.76">gold they valued gold at $35 an ounce</text>
  <text start="1195.46" dur="4.95">and those people that didn&amp;#39;t hand over</text>
  <text start="1197.08" dur="5.79">their gold guess what it went up by $15</text>
  <text start="1200.41" dur="5.4">an ounce and back then that was a lot of</text>
  <text start="1202.87" dur="5.58">money and if you had a lot of gold you</text>
  <text start="1205.81" dur="5.85">made out the same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="1208.45" dur="5.76">happen once again so get ready get</text>
