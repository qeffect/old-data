  <text start="56.67" dur="5.19">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.35" dur="6.09">episode 1320 to be and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.86" dur="5.43">July 3rd 2017 and thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.44" dur="6.06">is the fate of the world does not lie in</text>
  <text start="67.29" dur="5.07">the hands of the elite let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="70.5" dur="4.56">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="6.99">geopolitical news now we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="75.06" dur="6">he is going after voter fraud and we</text>
  <text start="79.35" dur="4.71">know that 29 states well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="4.44">cooperating whatsoever and he came out</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="4.86">and he said well what are they trying to</text>
  <text start="85.5" dur="5.28">hide well out in Rhode Island there were</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="4.05">a hundred and fifty thousand people</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="5.369">incorrectly placed on their voter rolls</text>
  <text start="92.97" dur="5.7">and nobody really noticed now during the</text>
  <text start="96.149" dur="6.151">November election the state had a total</text>
  <text start="98.67" dur="6.78">of about 780 1770 registered voters</text>
  <text start="102.3" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s even after Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="105.45" dur="4.949">Nellie Gore BIA purged the rolls of</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="4.319">almost around 65,000 names then she</text>
  <text start="110.399" dur="5.25">declared another 30,000 voters as</text>
  <text start="112.289" dur="6.391">inactive still there were a hundred and</text>
  <text start="115.649" dur="6.061">fifty thousand more names on the roll</text>
  <text start="118.68" dur="6.39">here which makes no sense now is this</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="6.9">fraud is it fake voters well we see that</text>
  <text start="125.07" dur="7.47">the Secretary of State said no it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="7.469">inaccuracies it&amp;#39;s just one big mistake</text>
  <text start="132.54" dur="6.87">and it&amp;#39;s not fake voters but Hillary</text>
  <text start="136.079" dur="6.331">Clinton won the state by just 70,000</text>
  <text start="139.41" dur="5.639">votes or less than half of the fake</text>
  <text start="142.41" dur="6.5">voters now I understand that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.049" dur="6.631">inaccuracies you know maybe a thousand</text>
  <text start="148.91" dur="6.48">twelve hundred eight hundred seven</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="7.77">hundred but a hundred and fifty thousand</text>
  <text start="155.39" dur="7">something is terribly wrong and this is</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="5.31">why this needs to be looked into because</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="4.77">something just doesn&amp;#39;t sound right now</text>
  <text start="164.76" dur="5.49">it looks like Germany&amp;#39;s Chancellor</text>
  <text start="167.16" dur="5.43">Angela Merkel and has been talking very</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="3.57">tough on climate change and we can see</text>
  <text start="172.59" dur="2.88">that many of the nations are out there</text>
  <text start="173.82" dur="3.57">saying that yes we need to join up the</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="5.13">climate change we need to stop this and</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="6.75">we need to put our currency into this</text>
  <text start="180.6" dur="5.669">and help the situation well they really</text>
  <text start="184.14" dur="2.69">want to be currency from the United</text>
  <text start="186.269" dur="3.021">States</text>
  <text start="186.83" dur="4.74">and we know what this was all about this</text>
  <text start="189.29" dur="3.99">was about bringing the United States</text>
  <text start="191.57" dur="2.25">down to the level of the rest of the</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="1.92">world</text>
  <text start="193.82" dur="3.57">so this way they can have their</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="4.89">one-world government this was their plan</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="5.13">from the beginning and also to charge</text>
  <text start="200.09" dur="4.35">everyone a carbon tax now we know that</text>
  <text start="202.52" dur="4.05">she&amp;#39;s been talking tough on climate</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="5.7">change promising to put it at the</text>
  <text start="206.57" dur="5.94">forefront of the g20 summit and doing</text>
  <text start="210.14" dur="5.31">everything she possibly can to help the</text>
  <text start="212.51" dur="5.73">world now behind the scenes however it</text>
  <text start="215.45" dur="5.34">appears that Merkel&amp;#39;s negotiating teams</text>
  <text start="218.24" dur="6.18">have been bending over backwards to tone</text>
  <text start="220.79" dur="7.05">down the climate action plan Germany has</text>
  <text start="224.42" dur="7.98">massively weakened its climate action</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="6.75">plan for the g20 summit very interesting</text>
  <text start="232.4" dur="3.51">is that because Trump backed out of it</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="3.57">and they don&amp;#39;t have the funds they need</text>
  <text start="235.91" dur="4.92">well why can&amp;#39;t these countries if</text>
  <text start="238.16" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re so concerned why don&amp;#39;t they kick</text>
  <text start="240.83" dur="6.06">in more funds because it doesn&amp;#39;t fit</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="6.21">into their overall plan their overall</text>
  <text start="246.89" dur="6.63">plan was not to help the earth their</text>
  <text start="249.83" dur="6.75">overall plan was to make all countries</text>
  <text start="253.52" dur="4.65">equally the same this way they can pass</text>
  <text start="256.58" dur="3.54">workers from one country to another</text>
  <text start="258.17" dur="5.13">where they can have full control over</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="4.62">the system and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="4.83">not happening right now</text>
  <text start="264.74" dur="6.24">now in the Czech Republic we can see</text>
  <text start="268.13" dur="6.57">they are basically doing what the United</text>
  <text start="270.98" dur="6.36">States did and they are creating the</text>
  <text start="274.7" dur="4.38">right to bear arms into their</text>
  <text start="277.34" dur="4.95">constitution now there are many</text>
  <text start="279.08" dur="5.64">countries throughout the world that are</text>
  <text start="282.29" dur="4.35">not far behind us such as Serbia Yemen</text>
  <text start="284.72" dur="5.1">Cyprus and many Western nations like</text>
  <text start="286.64" dur="5.85">Finland Switzerland and they all allow</text>
  <text start="289.82" dur="4.23">their citizens to carry weapons but the</text>
  <text start="292.49" dur="3.48">United States is one of the only</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="5.61">countries that has it in their</text>
  <text start="295.97" dur="6.81">constitution and we see well Honduras</text>
  <text start="299.66" dur="4.83">and Mexico have the same right in their</text>
  <text start="302.78" dur="3.57">constitution but they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="304.49" dur="4.11">restrictions yes we have restrictions</text>
  <text start="306.35" dur="3.42">here in the United States which most of</text>
  <text start="308.6" dur="6.03">them violate the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="309.77" dur="7.649">completely but we see that the Czech</text>
  <text start="314.63" dur="4.98">Republic they&amp;#39;re going to add this right</text>
  <text start="317.419" dur="3.121">to bear arms to its constitution and</text>
  <text start="319.61" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s very similar</text>
  <text start="320.54" dur="3.87">to the US second amendment to the</text>
  <text start="322.79" dur="2.88">Constitution which gives Americans the</text>
  <text start="324.41" dur="4.08">right to keep bear arms the check</text>
  <text start="325.67" dur="5.1">legislation reads citizens of the Czech</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="5.85">Republic have the right to acquire</text>
  <text start="330.77" dur="5.85">retain and bear arms and ammunition and</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="4.83">we see that the reason the founding</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="6.36">fathers decided to do this was not for</text>
  <text start="339.17" dur="6.12">hunting not for sport it was to protect</text>
  <text start="342.98" dur="4.98">the people against a tyrannical</text>
  <text start="345.29" dur="4.89">government a government that wanted to</text>
  <text start="347.96" dur="3.57">control the people because the founding</text>
  <text start="350.18" dur="3.78">fathers this is what they fought for</text>
  <text start="351.53" dur="5.61">they understood this this is why they</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="6.54">included it right below freedom of</text>
  <text start="357.14" dur="5.52">speech freedom of religion because what</text>
  <text start="360.5" dur="5.19">gives you that freedom the right to bear</text>
  <text start="362.66" dur="5.22">arms and to say no to the government</text>
  <text start="365.69" dur="4.41">because when there&amp;#39;s a population that</text>
  <text start="367.88" dur="4.59">does not have the right to bear arms and</text>
  <text start="370.1" dur="4.98">they do not have weapons and the</text>
  <text start="372.47" dur="5.4">government grows too big becomes</text>
  <text start="375.08" dur="5.16">tyrannical and decides to do whatever</text>
  <text start="377.87" dur="6.03">they want the people have no way of</text>
  <text start="380.24" dur="6.3">fighting back now we see that duterte</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="4.47">his decision to approach China as a</text>
  <text start="386.54" dur="4.77">partner rather than an adversary well</text>
  <text start="388.37" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s really paying off now people called</text>
  <text start="391.31" dur="4.5">him crazy for doing this because you</text>
  <text start="393.71" dur="3.96">need to go back in time because the</text>
  <text start="395.81" dur="4.32">United States was in the South China Sea</text>
  <text start="397.67" dur="4.92">saying that China they&amp;#39;re building these</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="5.22">islands they won&amp;#39;t let anyone sail there</text>
  <text start="402.59" dur="4.2">we have the right to navigation even</text>
  <text start="405.35" dur="3.3">though the United States never signed or</text>
  <text start="406.79" dur="3.69">ratified the right to navigation they</text>
  <text start="408.65" dur="4.08">were using that to convince the world</text>
  <text start="410.48" dur="4.02">and Duterte was out there saying no</text>
  <text start="412.73" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re not going to go along with this</text>
  <text start="414.5" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;re going to deal with China and he</text>
  <text start="416.63" dur="3.75">dealt with China and China says sure you</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="3.81">can sell your ships anywhere you want</text>
  <text start="420.38" dur="5.13">inside the South China Sea you can fish</text>
  <text start="422.66" dur="4.8">no problem now de jure tazed policy of</text>
  <text start="425.51" dur="5.25">reaching a cooperative deal in the South</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="6.78">China Sea to spin jain --is one belt one</text>
  <text start="430.76" dur="5.31">Road trade project to the Philippines so</text>
  <text start="434.24" dur="3.78">China has also pledged to assist</text>
  <text start="436.07" dur="5.01">Philippines in its war against terrorism</text>
  <text start="438.02" dur="6.42">when and if it is needed</text>
  <text start="441.08" dur="6.15">so right now Duterte he has secured his</text>
  <text start="444.44" dur="6.42">country&amp;#39;s future among the successful</text>
  <text start="447.23" dur="6.67">powers of the region and basically the</text>
  <text start="450.86" dur="4.72">world and we see at this point that he</text>
  <text start="453.9" dur="5.04">he&amp;#39;s teaming up with China because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="455.58" dur="6.089">realizes that this is the system this is</text>
  <text start="458.94" dur="5.46">the new economic system that he needs to</text>
  <text start="461.669" dur="4.56">be on and if he would have gone along</text>
  <text start="464.4" dur="3.9">with the United States with Obama at</text>
  <text start="466.229" dur="5.16">that time well his country would have</text>
  <text start="468.3" dur="7.02">been turned into a drug smuggling human</text>
  <text start="471.389" dur="6.691">trafficking country and it would have</text>
  <text start="475.32" dur="4.65">been a complete mess and most likely his</text>
  <text start="478.08" dur="7.01">country would be on the front lines of</text>
  <text start="479.97" dur="9.18">World War three now Trump has called</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="7.47">China Japan he&amp;#39;s called the leaders to</text>
  <text start="489.15" dur="5.989">discuss North and basically they are</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="6.04">looking at the North Korean situation</text>
  <text start="495.139" dur="5.471">they are talking about trade issues they</text>
  <text start="498.6" dur="6.18">want to talk about denuclearization of</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="7.22">North Korea and they want he wants Japan</text>
  <text start="504.78" dur="5.69">he wants China wants the Philippines</text>
  <text start="507.83" dur="5.17">basically all to work together and</text>
  <text start="510.47" dur="5.47">basically calm the situation down in</text>
  <text start="513" dur="7.409">North Korea now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="515.94" dur="6.24">is that the USS Stethem a guided missile</text>
  <text start="520.409" dur="3.68">destroyer sail within 12 nautical miles</text>
  <text start="522.18" dur="4.38">of the trying islands part of the</text>
  <text start="524.089" dur="4.391">Paracel Islands in the South China Sea</text>
  <text start="526.56" dur="4.23">and it really looks like the deep state</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="4.26">they are pushing their agenda you know</text>
  <text start="530.79" dur="3.9">sailing the ships very close to these</text>
  <text start="532.74" dur="4.23">islands trying to provoke China still</text>
  <text start="534.69" dur="4.89">now we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="5.07">important Trump does not have full</text>
  <text start="539.58" dur="4.41">control of every aspect of the</text>
  <text start="542.04" dur="4.14">government there are rogue elements</text>
  <text start="543.99" dur="5.94">still inside the government that are</text>
  <text start="546.18" dur="5.7">controlling certain areas and we can see</text>
  <text start="549.93" dur="4.29">this out in the Middle East we can see</text>
  <text start="551.88" dur="4.2">it out in the South China Sea and we can</text>
  <text start="554.22" dur="4.86">see that the deep state they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="556.08" dur="5.699">pushing buttons now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="559.08" dur="4.379">interesting is that Trump and Putin</text>
  <text start="561.779" dur="5.101">they&amp;#39;re going to be meeting at the g20</text>
  <text start="563.459" dur="4.411">summit later this week and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="566.88" dur="2.28">going to be talking about Russian</text>
  <text start="567.87" dur="3.42">meddling they&amp;#39;re not going to be talking</text>
  <text start="569.16" dur="4.41">about Russian hacking they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="571.29" dur="5.1">be talking about anything they want</text>
  <text start="573.57" dur="4.74">there is no specific agenda now what I</text>
  <text start="576.39" dur="3.18">think is happening right now is they</text>
  <text start="578.31" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t want to tell the corporate media</text>
  <text start="579.57" dur="5.519">what the agenda is because then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="4.949">going to go crazy over it I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="585.089" dur="4.891">going to be quiet I think they are</text>
  <text start="587.699" dur="3.39">have agendas set and I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="589.98" dur="3.24">going to be talking about things that</text>
  <text start="591.089" dur="4.05">are happening in Syria things are</text>
  <text start="593.22" dur="5.339">happening out around the world and</text>
  <text start="595.139" dur="7.22">they&amp;#39;re going to be coordinating to</text>
  <text start="598.559" dur="7.32">basically end all of this now this seems</text>
  <text start="602.359" dur="6.52">ridiculous on the surface but what you</text>
  <text start="605.879" dur="4.77">see happening now out in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="608.879" dur="2.76">especially with guitar and we&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="610.649" dur="2.94">into that in a moment</text>
  <text start="611.639" dur="3.901">especially what&amp;#39;s happening out in Syria</text>
  <text start="613.589" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;ll get to that in a moment and we can</text>
  <text start="615.54" dur="2.669">see what&amp;#39;s happening in the rest of the</text>
  <text start="616.829" dur="4.141">world we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="618.209" dur="6.78">absolutely changing right now now</text>
  <text start="620.97" dur="6.539">Germany is warning that this g20 meeting</text>
  <text start="624.989" dur="7.051">they&amp;#39;re very worried about cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="627.509" dur="7.35">and they have their cyber experts</text>
  <text start="632.04" dur="5.31">standing by to respond to any attack</text>
  <text start="634.859" dur="4.47">that occurs they also have 20,000 police</text>
  <text start="637.35" dur="4.62">with dogs horses helicopters they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="639.329" dur="5.31">going to be deployed out of the outside</text>
  <text start="641.97" dur="6.029">of the g20 meeting in Hamburg to protect</text>
  <text start="644.639" dur="5.55">the area now we know that they want to</text>
  <text start="647.999" dur="3.78">interrupt this g20 meeting they really</text>
  <text start="650.189" dur="4.291">don&amp;#39;t want Putin and Trump to get</text>
  <text start="651.779" dur="4.11">together in person and they&amp;#39;ll probably</text>
  <text start="654.48" dur="3.299">do whatever they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="655.889" dur="3.961">interrupt this now we&amp;#39;ll have to watch</text>
  <text start="657.779" dur="4.59">and see and how this turns out but we</text>
  <text start="659.85" dur="4.439">can see right now that Trump and Putin</text>
  <text start="662.369" dur="4.351">they have been talking with each other</text>
  <text start="664.289" dur="4.77">and I think they&amp;#39;re working together in</text>
  <text start="666.72" dur="5.039">Syria right now I think they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="669.059" dur="4.98">together in other areas to calm the</text>
  <text start="671.759" dur="5.52">situation down everywhere now with Qatar</text>

  <text start="775.42" dur="3.539">to see what they come up with and we</text>
  <text start="777.519" dur="4.25">need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="778.959" dur="7.44">important here what is happening in Iraq</text>
  <text start="781.769" dur="6.791">well according to the Iraqi generals the</text>
  <text start="786.399" dur="6.54">Islamic state is pretty much obliterated</text>
  <text start="788.56" dur="6.57">in Iraq in Syria we have the Islamic</text>
  <text start="792.939" dur="4.411">state al Qaeda al sham and the rest of</text>
  <text start="795.13" dur="6.66">the terrorist organizations they are</text>
  <text start="797.35" dur="7.77">losing ground like crazy so the support</text>
  <text start="801.79" dur="6.39">of terrorism right now really makes no</text>
  <text start="805.12" dur="5.85">sense for these Gulf nations and as</text>
  <text start="808.18" dur="4.29">everything completely falls apart they</text>
  <text start="810.97" dur="3.359">don&amp;#39;t want to be left standing there</text>
  <text start="812.47" dur="4.14">going ok we were the ones who created</text>
  <text start="814.329" dur="5.88">all of this so what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="816.61" dur="5.94">is basically mop up the situation and we</text>
  <text start="820.209" dur="6.411">can see this mop-up operation going on</text>
  <text start="822.55" dur="6.87">right now right now a Syrian legislator</text>
  <text start="826.62" dur="4.449">came out and said listen the United</text>
  <text start="829.42" dur="6.57">States is helping the Islamic state to</text>
  <text start="831.069" dur="8.01">escape Raqqa we&amp;#39;ve seen US planes coming</text>

  <text start="839.079" dur="6.18">state terrorists from the Raqqa province</text>
  <text start="841.899" dur="5.43">to someplace else and we can see just</text>
  <text start="845.259" dur="3.781">with this they&amp;#39;ve done this before where</text>
  <text start="847.329" dur="5.161">they move the Islamic state around it</text>
  <text start="849.04" dur="5.95">looks like they&amp;#39;re removing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="852.49" dur="4.84">state because they realize at</text>
  <text start="854.99" dur="4.32">this point they&amp;#39;re beaten and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="857.33" dur="5.879">let them get captured</text>
  <text start="859.31" dur="5.85">they can&amp;#39;t allow the records to be out</text>
  <text start="863.209" dur="5.341">there so what they do is they have this</text>
  <text start="865.16" dur="7.32">gigantic mop-up operation the walls are</text>
  <text start="868.55" dur="6.479">closing in on the deep state and listen</text>
  <text start="872.48" dur="5.13">time is ticking down here I mean look at</text>
  <text start="875.029" dur="5.911">this out in Syria for the first time</text>

  <text start="887.959" dur="5.101">circulation on Sunday this is the first</text>
  <text start="890.45" dur="5.37">time Assad&amp;#39;s face has been featured on</text>

  <text start="900.56" dur="6.3">tells you that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="903.35" dur="6.359">changing now the u.s. is setting up a</text>

  <text start="921.14" dur="3.75">think it&amp;#39;s going to last too long</text>
  <text start="922.52" dur="5.189">because we can see that Russia Syria</text>
  <text start="924.89" dur="5.069">they are sweeping through Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="927.709" dur="5.851">heading into the East the northeastern</text>

  <text start="933.56" dur="4.89">many bases the deep state sets up I</text>
  <text start="935.75" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t think this is going to last much</text>
  <text start="938.45" dur="4.4">longer because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="940.19" dur="6.66">now is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson</text>
  <text start="942.85" dur="6.72">well he&amp;#39;s told the UN Secretary General</text>
  <text start="946.85" dur="6.71">that the fate of the Syrian leader</text>
  <text start="949.57" dur="6.82">Bashar al-assad now lies in the hands of</text>
  <text start="953.56" dur="5.17">Russia and he said the Trump</text>
  <text start="956.39" dur="6.72">administration their number-one priority</text>
  <text start="958.73" dur="6.69">is getting rid of the Islamic state now</text>
  <text start="963.11" dur="5.88">think about what he&amp;#39;s saying here the</text>
  <text start="965.42" dur="6.21">fate of Assad is left with the Russians</text>
  <text start="968.99" dur="4.32">now Assad invited Russia in what do you</text>
  <text start="971.63" dur="5.04">think the fates going to be he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="973.31" dur="5.04">to be present still now Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="976.67" dur="4.5">number-one mission the administration&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="978.35" dur="7.17">number-one mission is removing the paid</text>
  <text start="981.17" dur="7.599">mercenary army and we can see that what</text>
  <text start="985.52" dur="7.059">they&amp;#39;re saying is Assad is going to</text>
  <text start="988.769" dur="5.85">have a government in Syria and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="992.579" dur="5.01">getting rid of the terrorist groups at</text>
  <text start="994.619" dur="6.991">the same time we&amp;#39;re making things right</text>
  <text start="997.589" dur="6.84">and this is the mission it looks like</text>
  <text start="1001.61" dur="5.219">Trump knows who&amp;#39;s controlling the</text>
  <text start="1004.429" dur="6.33">terrorist groups at this point it looks</text>
  <text start="1006.829" dur="7.17">like Putin and Trump they&amp;#39;ve already had</text>
  <text start="1010.759" dur="7.14">the discussion and we can see that out</text>
  <text start="1013.999" dur="6.51">in Iraq out in Syria eventually out in</text>
  <text start="1017.899" dur="4.92">Afghanistan the deep States paid</text>
  <text start="1020.509" dur="4.2">mercenary armies they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>

  <text start="1024.709" dur="5.37">transported someplace else or destroyed</text>
  <text start="1027.699" dur="4.84">but we can see they&amp;#39;re not giving up</text>
  <text start="1030.079" dur="4.32">just yet the Syrian rebels</text>
  <text start="1032.539" dur="4.321">they&amp;#39;ve come out and they have accused</text>
  <text start="1034.399" dur="5.55">the Syrian army of using yes chemical</text>

  <text start="1056.809" dur="6.031">people cough it makes no sense and we</text>
  <text start="1060.98" dur="4.829">could see at this point they&amp;#39;re just</text>
