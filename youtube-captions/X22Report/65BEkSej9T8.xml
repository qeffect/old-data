  <text start="47.92" dur="4.979">financial institutions and how we are</text>
  <text start="50.26" dur="4.59">completely not protected from what is</text>
  <text start="52.899" dur="3">coming and we&amp;#39;re going to get a little</text>
  <text start="54.85" dur="2.85">we&amp;#39;re going to get into that a little</text>
  <text start="55.899" dur="3.511">bit later in this report but let&amp;#39;s start</text>
  <text start="57.7" dur="3.449">out with the economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="59.41" dur="5.129">we&amp;#39;re going to head out the Spain right</text>
  <text start="61.149" dur="5.461">now and again as we know Europe is in a</text>
  <text start="64.539" dur="3.69">recession slash depression it is not</text>
  <text start="66.61" dur="4.7">getting better whatsoever</text>
  <text start="68.229" dur="5.791">and right now official figures show</text>
  <text start="71.31" dur="4.96">Spain&amp;#39;s public debt has soared to a new</text>
  <text start="74.02" dur="4.5">record high last year despite numerous</text>
  <text start="76.27" dur="4.95">budget cutting measures and we get it</text>
  <text start="78.52" dur="5.82">they are not going to get out of this</text>
  <text start="81.22" dur="6.899">along with France a lot along with Italy</text>
  <text start="84.34" dur="6.29">Greece Cyprus and it&amp;#39;s spreading to</text>
  <text start="88.119" dur="4.831">other European countries they are</text>
  <text start="90.63" dur="4.62">everything there is getting worse and</text>
  <text start="92.95" dur="6.18">again what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="5.549">that the debt in Spain right now reach</text>
  <text start="99.13" dur="7.23">ninety three point nine percent of</text>
  <text start="100.799" dur="9.521">Spain&amp;#39;s GDP in 2013 last year their debt</text>
  <text start="106.36" dur="6.829">was at 86% so it is continually going up</text>
  <text start="110.32" dur="6.39">because when you give when the IMF the</text>
  <text start="113.189" dur="6.191">European Union decides to give Spain</text>
  <text start="116.71" dur="5.31">more debt they have to cut jobs they</text>
  <text start="119.38" dur="6">have to cut programs and this does not</text>
  <text start="122.02" dur="6.629">work out well they cannot increase</text>
  <text start="125.38" dur="6.329">revenue people don&amp;#39;t have work people</text>
  <text start="128.649" dur="5.581">have a very rough time making ends meet</text>
  <text start="131.709" dur="5.61">and right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="134.23" dur="5.94">the Spaniards along with all the other</text>
  <text start="137.319" dur="3.181">countries are staging protests against</text>
  <text start="140.17" dur="2.43">the gun</text>
  <text start="140.5" dur="4.02">government against their spending cuts</text>
  <text start="142.6" dur="3.96">arguing that austerity measures have</text>
  <text start="144.52" dur="3.84">resulted in more draw losses in recent</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="4.14">years and there&amp;#39;s about four point eight</text>
  <text start="148.36" dur="4.86">million spaniards right now that are</text>
  <text start="150.7" dur="5.61">unemployed as of January</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="5.91">now we all understand here in the United</text>
  <text start="156.31" dur="5.16">States that everything here is in a</text>
  <text start="159.13" dur="3.63">complete illusion and we can see that</text>
  <text start="161.47" dur="3.68">you know they manipulate the numbers</text>
  <text start="162.76" dur="4.38">they manipulate GDP they manipulate</text>
  <text start="165.15" dur="7.09">unemployment they nip you late in</text>
  <text start="167.14" dur="7.86">inflation they go back you know and to</text>
  <text start="172.24" dur="5.249">in time and they recalculate all the</text>
  <text start="175" dur="5.209">numbers to make it fit their illusion</text>
  <text start="177.489" dur="6.211">but right now the consumer confidence is</text>
  <text start="180.209" dur="5.081">completely plummeting at this point so</text>
  <text start="183.7" dur="3.45">what are we seeing right now well they</text>
  <text start="185.29" dur="4.35">expected an eighty-two point to number</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="4.559">it is that come the number has come in</text>
  <text start="189.64" dur="4.68">at seventy nine point nine and it looks</text>
  <text start="191.709" dur="6.53">like the outlook fell by its most in</text>
  <text start="194.32" dur="6.21">five months at this time and again</text>
  <text start="198.239" dur="4.151">consumer confidence when people are</text>
  <text start="200.53" dur="3.87">looking out there they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="202.39" dur="5.01">income coming in they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="204.4" dur="5.309">disposable income and they see on the</text>
  <text start="207.4" dur="4.589">news that all these layoffs are coming</text>

  <text start="215.32" dur="4.32">off already or been looking for work for</text>
  <text start="217.39" dur="4.02">a very long time confidence is going to</text>
  <text start="219.64" dur="4.56">continually go down again and we have to</text>
  <text start="221.41" dur="5.91">remember this is showing up in the</text>
  <text start="224.2" dur="5.97">retail market this is showing up in the</text>
  <text start="227.32" dur="5.61">housing market and we can see that</text>
  <text start="230.17" dur="4.68">things are not getting better at all and</text>

  <text start="254.62" dur="3.6">Sachs came out with their analysis and</text>
  <text start="257.2" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re looking at a twenty five percent</text>
  <text start="258.22" dur="4.17">decline and we&amp;#39;re going to see major</text>
  <text start="260.5" dur="3.54">layoffs in the financial industry well</text>
  <text start="262.39" dur="3.779">Barclays is going to be laying off more</text>

  <text start="441.16" dur="4.379">they&amp;#39;re making each month from the banks</text>

  <text start="453.91" dur="4.77">mortgage departments and they are</text>
  <text start="456.55" dur="4.17">continually laying off people in their</text>
  <text start="458.68" dur="4.62">mortgage departments and we also have to</text>
  <text start="460.72" dur="4.83">understand that the American people</text>
  <text start="463.3" dur="5.01">since 2008 most of the homes were in</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="6.899">foreclosure or short sales credit was</text>
  <text start="468.31" dur="6.389">ruined people were laid off they</text>

  <text start="474.699" dur="3.96">full-time job it wasn&amp;#39;t the same pay and</text>
  <text start="477.31" dur="4.13">those people who couldn&amp;#39;t find that</text>
  <text start="478.659" dur="6.69">full-time job are working one two three</text>
  <text start="481.44" dur="6.24">part-time jobs and right now we have to</text>
  <text start="485.349" dur="7.411">think of the first-time homebuyer</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="8.26">there is no way the youth of America are</text>
  <text start="492.76" dur="4.62">going to pick up the slack why because</text>
  <text start="495.94" dur="3.539">they&amp;#39;re coming out of college they have</text>
  <text start="497.38" dur="4.17">a huge amount of student loans and the</text>
  <text start="499.479" dur="4.891">government looked at the student loan</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="4.53">and see most of the youths coming out of</text>
  <text start="504.37" dur="4.169">college can&amp;#39;t pay back and what have</text>
  <text start="506.08" dur="4.95">they done they allowed the students to</text>
  <text start="508.539" dur="6.271">modify their loans they some of them</text>
  <text start="511.03" dur="5.4">were able to defer them some had their</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="4.8">loans modified so their payments were</text>
  <text start="516.43" dur="5.46">smaller but also the first time buyers</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="4.2">segment of the market has a store has</text>
  <text start="521.89" dur="5.37">historically averaged about 40 percent</text>
  <text start="523.81" dur="5.75">of the total homebuyer demand in 2013</text>
  <text start="527.26" dur="6.24">that percentage slipped to 38 percent</text>
  <text start="529.56" dur="5.35">now it has slipped further and this is</text>
  <text start="533.5" dur="4.95">coming from the National Association of</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="6.149">Realtors it is slipped and plunged to 27</text>
  <text start="538.45" dur="4.769">percent and again this is</text>
  <text start="541.059" dur="4.08">continually dropping because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="543.219" dur="5.46">find work they&amp;#39;re living with their</text>
  <text start="545.139" dur="6.06">parents just to pay for their student</text>
  <text start="548.679" dur="4.29">loans and to pay beam and maybe pay for</text>
  <text start="551.199" dur="4.53">their car just to get to that part-time</text>
  <text start="552.969" dur="5.31">job so they are not going to pick up the</text>
  <text start="555.729" dur="4.82">slack whatsoever it is completely</text>
  <text start="558.279" dur="4.83">impossible and the label force</text>
  <text start="560.549" dur="5.35">participation participation rate for the</text>
  <text start="563.109" dur="6.18">Americans in their 20s hit a record low</text>
  <text start="565.899" dur="7.77">in 2013 of seventy five point five</text>

  <text start="694.359" dur="6.12">completely imploded on itself so we can</text>
  <text start="697.569" dur="6.901">see why those people wouldn&amp;#39;t be buying</text>

  <text start="739.149" dur="5.581">think about it back in 2008 Americans</text>

  <text start="744.73" dur="4.379">you think it&amp;#39;s going to be this time</text>
  <text start="745.929" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s going to be much much worse now we</text>
  <text start="749.109" dur="5.4">understand that foreign countries and</text>

  <text start="756.73" dur="6.539">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing is that foreigners</text>
  <text start="760.47" dur="6.01">sell a record amount over a hundred</text>
  <text start="763.269" dur="4.891">billion worth of Treasuries and we</text>

  <text start="771.579" dur="8.401">who are they it&amp;#39;s unclear at this time</text>
  <text start="774.489" dur="7.981">but in a report just released for the</text>
  <text start="779.98" dur="4.949">week ending March 12 Treasuries held in</text>
  <text start="782.47" dur="4.829">custody by the Fed dropped to two point</text>

  <text start="796.359" dur="6.51">so the question is is it China is it</text>
  <text start="800.079" dur="4.32">Russia or other nations that are saying</text>
  <text start="802.869" dur="4.331">you know what we don&amp;#39;t want to hold on</text>
  <text start="804.399" dur="4.601">to these anymore because we see what is</text>

  <text start="813.44" dur="6.66">implode okay now let&amp;#39;s move on to</text>
  <text start="817.97" dur="2.91">Obamacare and people who&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="820.88" dur="3.9">they know what I think about Obamacare</text>
  <text start="822.89" dur="3.69">is a complete cash grab they just wanted</text>

  <text start="826.58" dur="3.75">health insurance for the people and of</text>
  <text start="828.8" dur="3.66">course everything that President Obama</text>
  <text start="830.33" dur="3.93">said about Obamacare was completely</text>
  <text start="832.46" dur="3.78">false and it was always the opposite of</text>
  <text start="834.26" dur="4.56">what he said I guess he didn&amp;#39;t read his</text>
  <text start="836.24" dur="4.35">own bill because it&amp;#39;s he seems a little</text>
  <text start="838.82" dur="5.1">confusing again most of the people</text>
  <text start="840.59" dur="6.36">didn&amp;#39;t read the Affordable Care Act they</text>
  <text start="843.92" dur="5.13">just passed it and again we can see how</text>
  <text start="846.95" dur="5.01">this is turning out it is complete is a</text>
  <text start="849.05" dur="5.16">complete disaster but right now Obama</text>
  <text start="851.96" dur="4.61">says you know what okay I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="854.21" dur="4.89">have to admit that you might have to</text>

  <text start="861.86" dur="3.9">might have to find someone else at this</text>

  <text start="867.89" dur="5.49">out to be completely false and fake</text>
  <text start="869.84" dur="5.58">because their plan was to get everybody</text>

  <text start="1200.19" dur="3.87">certain money coming out of there and</text>
  <text start="1201.87" dur="3.63">again I would be worried too I would</text>
  <text start="1204.06" dur="2.499">most likely probably run to the bank</text>

  <text start="1294.279" dur="5.34">Russia are not a threat or meant in a</text>
  <text start="1297.309" dur="5.281">personal way towards Russian President</text>
  <text start="1299.619" dur="5.581">Putin I don&amp;#39;t know if somebody tells me</text>
  <text start="1302.59" dur="5.309">I can&amp;#39;t take my money or I can&amp;#39;t travel</text>

  <text start="1325.95" dur="5.199">so what he&amp;#39;s saying is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1329.139" dur="4.77">ridiculous but of course he came up with</text>
  <text start="1331.149" dur="4.561">a politician babble and he came out and</text>
  <text start="1333.909" dur="3.48">he said it is meant as a matter of</text>

  <text start="1350.29" dur="3.57">does that even mean</text>
  <text start="1351.16" dur="5.34">so I mean you can see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1353.86" dur="4.38">here their backs are against the wall</text>
  <text start="1356.5" dur="4.5">they don&amp;#39;t know what else to do they</text>
  <text start="1358.24" dur="5.22">need to do something they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1361" dur="5.34">provoke Russia into doing something in</text>
  <text start="1363.46" dur="5.52">Ukraine the central bankers goal is the</text>
  <text start="1366.34" dur="5.91">same as it&amp;#39;s always been to start war</text>
  <text start="1368.98" dur="6.48">and we can see what is happening at this</text>
  <text start="1372.25" dur="4.83">time now listen Russia said if you</text>
  <text start="1375.46" dur="3.21">impose sanctions on this there&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1377.08" dur="3.57">some type of boomerang effect and of</text>
  <text start="1378.67" dur="3.57">course you know they can dump their</text>
  <text start="1380.65" dur="3.27">Treasuries they can remove their</text>
  <text start="1382.24" dur="3.42">reserves they can make other countries</text>
  <text start="1383.92" dur="3.03">go along with them and sit not make them</text>
  <text start="1385.66" dur="3.93">but they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="1386.95" dur="4.74">partnering partnering and supporting</text>
  <text start="1389.59" dur="3.3">Russia and China could say you know what</text>
  <text start="1391.69" dur="3">we&amp;#39;re going to dump our treasures we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1392.89" dur="4.11">going to dump our reserves and they can</text>
  <text start="1394.69" dur="3.9">you know decimate the economy of the</text>
  <text start="1397" dur="3.21">United States but there are other things</text>
  <text start="1398.59" dur="5.46">that they can do and there are other</text>
  <text start="1400.21" dur="6.69">boomerang effects Russia arms sales to</text>
  <text start="1404.05" dur="5.22">China could go hog-wild they can start</text>
  <text start="1406.9" dur="5.67">selling the Russian su-35 and advanced</text>
  <text start="1409.27" dur="6.33">conventional submarines to China if the</text>
  <text start="1412.57" dur="6.21">Ukraine situation gets worse</text>
  <text start="1415.6" dur="7.17">Moscow goes all-in on natural resource</text>
  <text start="1418.78" dur="4.91">sales to Beijing they can create large</text>
  <text start="1422.77" dur="4.01">dale&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1423.69" dur="5.92">and China you know could purchase</text>
  <text start="1426.78" dur="4.99">Russian oil natural grass natural gas</text>
  <text start="1429.61" dur="4.92">and any other natural resources it can</text>
  <text start="1431.77" dur="5.25">get it hands on Russian arms sales to</text>
  <text start="1434.53" dur="4.86">Iran could go forward even though with</text>
  <text start="1437.02" dur="4.02">the p5 plus 1 deal moving forward Moscow</text>
  <text start="1439.39" dur="3.6">could seek to make trouble for</text>
  <text start="1441.04" dur="5.94">Washington and its allies by rebooting</text>
  <text start="1442.99" dur="7.74">arms sales to Iran again Russia could</text>
  <text start="1446.98" dur="8.52">start sending in arms to Syria Russia</text>
  <text start="1450.73" dur="8.64">may have offered a more weapons to Syria</text>
  <text start="1455.5" dur="6.62">and help Assad really beat down the</text>
  <text start="1459.37" dur="6">rebels and remove them from Syria and</text>
  <text start="1462.12" dur="6.67">again they can even take this one step</text>
  <text start="1465.37" dur="6.06">further Russia could start taking large</text>
  <text start="1468.79" dur="4.74">sections of eastern Ukraine and they can</text>
  <text start="1471.43" dur="3.93">be making a completely Russian</text>
  <text start="1473.53" dur="3.66">and then what would that mean that means</text>
  <text start="1475.36" dur="3.77">Washington would be forced to consider</text>
  <text start="1477.19" dur="4.8">beefing up its security commitments in</text>
  <text start="1479.13" dur="5.32">Europe so we can see there are many</text>
  <text start="1481.99" dur="5.85">different things that Russia could do</text>
  <text start="1484.45" dur="5.97">with China with Iran with Syria and it</text>
  <text start="1487.84" dur="4.95">seems like it&amp;#39;s almost where the United</text>
  <text start="1490.42" dur="4.26">States is dealing with at this time</text>
  <text start="1492.79" dur="3.96">because there they want to remove Assad</text>
  <text start="1494.68" dur="3.45">from government if you want to get into</text>
  <text start="1496.75" dur="5.01">the banking system or remove the</text>
  <text start="1498.13" dur="6.24">government of Iran the China is a direct</text>
  <text start="1501.76" dur="4.53">threat to the dollar and Russia is a</text>
  <text start="1504.37" dur="4.74">direct threat to the United States in</text>
  <text start="1506.29" dur="5.79">Ukraine and Russia backs Syria and Iran</text>
  <text start="1509.11" dur="7.11">so I mean this is all coming full circle</text>
  <text start="1512.08" dur="6.18">at this time now we understand that both</text>
  <text start="1516.22" dur="5.04">countries are having drills right now</text>
  <text start="1518.26" dur="5.94">and the US Army is going to lead at NATO</text>
  <text start="1521.26" dur="4.77">military exercise in Ukraine the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1524.2" dur="4.02">and his allies chose to go ahead with</text>
  <text start="1526.03" dur="4.41">its exercise in Ukraine while canceling</text>
  <text start="1528.22" dur="5.49">the one in Russia and this demonstrates</text>
  <text start="1530.44" dur="4.62">Western support for Kiev in since</text>
  <text start="1533.71" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;ve been having this confrontation</text>
  <text start="1535.06" dur="4.77">with Russia the exercise near the Polish</text>
  <text start="1538.3" dur="4.05">border is to promote regional stability</text>
  <text start="1539.83" dur="5.04">and security strength of partnership and</text>
  <text start="1542.35" dur="5.49">capacity and they&amp;#39;re going and moving</text>
  <text start="1544.87" dur="5.25">forward with these drills and at the</text>
  <text start="1547.84" dur="3.78">same time we understand that the United</text>
  <text start="1550.12" dur="2.28">States is keeping the fleet in the</text>
  <text start="1551.62" dur="4.86">Mediterranean</text>
  <text start="1552.4" dur="5.97">so Russia right now is launching</text>
  <text start="1556.48" dur="5.78">training flights over the Mediterranean</text>
  <text start="1558.37" dur="8.61">Sea amid this whole Ukraine Syrian</text>
  <text start="1562.26" dur="7.11">standoff at this time and we also have</text>
  <text start="1566.98" dur="5.46">to remember that Russia is having a</text>
  <text start="1569.37" dur="5.65">drill along Ukraine border they have</text>
  <text start="1572.44" dur="4.26">about 8,000 troops and again there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1575.02" dur="3.3">drills happening all over and I know</text>
  <text start="1576.7" dur="3.63">everyone&amp;#39;s saying oh they&amp;#39;re massing</text>
  <text start="1578.32" dur="4.92">troops along the border they invaded</text>
  <text start="1580.33" dur="5.46">Crimea but again the same things</text>
  <text start="1583.24" dur="4.35">happening on the other side a destroyer</text>
  <text start="1585.79" dur="4.35">was brought into the Black Sea there are</text>
  <text start="1587.59" dur="7.02">three warships from the United States</text>
  <text start="1590.14" dur="7.14">and the black sea f-16s were delivered</text>
  <text start="1594.61" dur="4.59">to Poland and Lithuania they have AWACS</text>
  <text start="1597.28" dur="3.84">up in the air monitoring the whole</text>
  <text start="1599.2" dur="4.08">situation there&amp;#39;s true build ups and</text>
  <text start="1601.12" dur="3.6">drills going on every single place</text>
  <text start="1603.28" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s drills from the United States</text>
  <text start="1604.72" dur="2.669">and other nations in the Black Sea at</text>
  <text start="1606.97" dur="2.999">this time</text>
  <text start="1607.389" dur="5.67">so both sides are flexing muscles both</text>
  <text start="1609.969" dur="6.36">sides are showing yes we have military</text>
  <text start="1613.059" dur="6.54">force and we will be ready to do</text>
  <text start="1616.329" dur="6.78">anything if something should happen now</text>
  <text start="1619.599" dur="7.02">there was a drone that was intercepted</text>
  <text start="1623.109" dur="7.14">in Crimea an American scout attack drone</text>
  <text start="1626.619" dur="6.42">was intercepted in Crimea and judging by</text>
  <text start="1630.249" dur="5.61">the side markings the MQ 5b drone was</text>
  <text start="1633.039" dur="5.21">part of the 66 u.s. brigade of military</text>
  <text start="1635.859" dur="5.25">intelligence with the main location in</text>
  <text start="1638.249" dur="5.38">bavaria and they brought it down and how</text>
  <text start="1641.109" dur="6.06">did they bring this down well as you</text>
  <text start="1643.629" dur="6.9">know it is easy to hack into the control</text>
  <text start="1647.169" dur="6.3">systems of these drones and the drone</text>
  <text start="1650.529" dur="4.77">was at the height of about 4,000 meters</text>
  <text start="1653.469" dur="4.11">and was practically invisible from Earth</text>
  <text start="1655.299" dur="3.96">and it was possible to break the drones</text>
  <text start="1657.579" dur="4.17">link with its American operators with</text>
  <text start="1659.259" dur="5.37">the help of electronic warfare complex</text>
  <text start="1661.749" dur="4.68">and as a result of device made an</text>
  <text start="1664.629" dur="3.33">emergency landing and passed into the</text>
  <text start="1666.429" dur="5.34">possession of the self-defense forces</text>
  <text start="1667.959" dur="6.84">almost unbroken in Crimea so right now</text>
  <text start="1671.769" dur="5.7">they have this drone and it is there now</text>
  <text start="1674.799" dur="5.49">we understand that the United States</text>
  <text start="1677.469" dur="5.37">wants Assad out they&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="1680.289" dur="4.92">everything to remove him now they are</text>
  <text start="1682.839" dur="5.76">ramping up forces they&amp;#39;re building the</text>
  <text start="1685.209" dur="5.52">military assets to make a strike into</text>
  <text start="1688.599" dur="4.44">Syria and we&amp;#39;re going to see this happen</text>
  <text start="1690.729" dur="4.41">in the next couple of weeks and because</text>
  <text start="1693.039" dur="3.87">they are in a short timeframe because we</text>
  <text start="1695.139" dur="5.61">understand that the mid your elections</text>
  <text start="1696.909" dur="6.48">are coming up a mid year of this year so</text>
  <text start="1700.749" dur="5.55">the Syrian Parliament approved a new</text>
  <text start="1703.389" dur="6.27">election law and it allows other people</text>
  <text start="1706.299" dur="6.96">to run for election against Assad but</text>
  <text start="1709.659" dur="6.87">you have to be a you have to be Syrian</text>
  <text start="1713.259" dur="6.78">and you have to be living in Syria for</text>
  <text start="1716.529" dur="6.45">10 years to be nominated to run for</text>
  <text start="1720.039" dur="6.661">president so this new law was instated</text>
  <text start="1722.979" dur="6.66">so any of these rebel forces who want to</text>
  <text start="1726.7" dur="6.149">take over they cannot because most of</text>
  <text start="1729.639" dur="7.26">them as we all know are not Syrian they</text>
  <text start="1732.849" dur="6.9">are paid mercenaries they are people</text>
  <text start="1736.899" dur="3.831">from all other countries paid to go in</text>
  <text start="1739.749" dur="4.281">there and</text>
  <text start="1740.73" dur="5.61">shout Assad and of course this hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1744.03" dur="3.84">been happening and this is why we had</text>
  <text start="1746.34" dur="3.78">this incident back in August of 2013</text>
  <text start="1747.87" dur="5.07">that didn&amp;#39;t really turn out to do</text>
  <text start="1750.12" dur="5.19">anything because the people of America</text>
  <text start="1752.94" dur="5.55">were not fort they couldn&amp;#39;t prove</text>
  <text start="1755.31" dur="5.22">anything and everyone realized that you</text>
  <text start="1758.49" dur="4.38">know what I think this is a false flag</text>
  <text start="1760.53" dur="6.54">event I don&amp;#39;t believe that Assad used</text>
  <text start="1762.87" dur="6.54">chemical weapons on his own people now</text>
  <text start="1767.07" dur="5.64">Iran and Russia they are finalizing</text>
  <text start="1769.41" dur="6.3">their trade deal soon and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1772.71" dur="5.22">through a final agreement and they have</text>
  <text start="1775.71" dur="4.26">reached for broader economic and trade</text>
  <text start="1777.93" dur="4.2">cooperation and also you have to</text>
  <text start="1779.97" dur="5.58">remember Russia has also made deals with</text>
  <text start="1782.13" dur="6.57">Egypt has also made deals with Syria and</text>
  <text start="1785.55" dur="4.38">again China is also doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="1788.7" dur="4.29">all throughout the Middle East and</text>
  <text start="1789.93" dur="8.25">Africa and in Afghanistan and we can see</text>
  <text start="1792.99" dur="7.5">this is happening every place now we</text>
  <text start="1798.18" dur="4.38">understand the whole conflict in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1800.49" dur="4.65">and right now they&amp;#39;re reporting that</text>
  <text start="1802.56" dur="4.34">several Russian state TV channels have</text>
  <text start="1805.14" dur="4.08">been hit by a large cyberattack</text>
  <text start="1806.9" dur="5.56">suspected to partly come from Kiev</text>
  <text start="1809.22" dur="5.94">remember the Kiev government there was</text>
  <text start="1812.46" dur="4.77">shutting down all Russian TV channels</text>
  <text start="1815.16" dur="4.2">well I guess they decided to hit it with</text>
  <text start="1817.23" dur="3.93">a cyberattack and just bring them all</text>
  <text start="1819.36" dur="4.05">down and again do we know where these</text>
  <text start="1821.16" dur="3.63">attacks come from exactly not really</text>
  <text start="1823.41" dur="4.02">because they can bounce them off servers</text>
  <text start="1824.79" dur="5.46">but in this instance we can we can kind</text>
  <text start="1827.43" dur="4.95">of tell who actually did it that also</text>
  <text start="1830.25" dur="5.19">the Russian president site was brought</text>
  <text start="1832.38" dur="5.91">down and we can see that they are</text>
  <text start="1835.44" dur="4.77">pushing this agenda forward and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1838.29" dur="3.18">making it very difficult and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1840.21" dur="4.44">hitting different areas with</text>
  <text start="1841.47" dur="6.45">cyberattacks at this time now in the UK</text>
  <text start="1844.65" dur="5.72">which I find very interesting in a world</text>
  <text start="1847.92" dur="5.16">war 2 ever bunker beneath London streets</text>
  <text start="1850.37" dur="4.72">dozens of young computer experts are</text>
  <text start="1853.08" dur="3.78">racing to understand why Britain&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1855.09" dur="3.87">banking network suddenly seemed to have</text>
  <text start="1856.86" dur="4.5">gone offline now this is a training</text>
  <text start="1858.96" dur="5.07">exercise that they are doing right now</text>

  <text start="1878.91" dur="7.5">definitely planning to bring down the</text>
  <text start="1882.69" dur="8.43">entire system because they understand</text>
  <text start="1886.41" dur="7.8">the economy cannot go on and it is</text>
  <text start="1891.12" dur="5.52">collapsing and it is better to blame it</text>
  <text start="1894.21" dur="6.45">on another country than to have the</text>
  <text start="1896.64" dur="5.55">blame on them and when I say them I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1900.66" dur="3.96">talking about the central bankers and</text>

  <text start="1920.97" dur="4.14">businesses individuals will need to take</text>
  <text start="1923.13" dur="5.31">steps to prepare and defend themselves</text>
  <text start="1925.11" dur="6.48">against these attacks now what are we</text>
  <text start="1928.44" dur="4.68">seeing well we understand that over the</text>
  <text start="1931.59" dur="3.45">past three years or so they&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="2017.33" dur="6.39">the u.s. power grid and again we are</text>

  <text start="2026.51" dur="3.63">weren&amp;#39;t are going to need to be prepared</text>
  <text start="2027.92" dur="4.95">for when the lights go out and this</text>
  <text start="2030.14" dur="5.28">report goes on to say the entire u.s.</text>
  <text start="2032.87" dur="5.34">power grid could be shut down for more</text>
  <text start="2035.42" dur="5.64">than a month if just nine of the over</text>
  <text start="2038.21" dur="4.68">55,000 electric substations place</text>
  <text start="2041.06" dur="6.6">throughout the nation where sabotage by</text>
  <text start="2042.89" dur="8.19">terrorists hmm nine out of the 55,000</text>
  <text start="2047.66" dur="8.1">you think that dry run in California was</text>
  <text start="2051.08" dur="6.15">done on purpose I do a study of the</text>
  <text start="2055.76" dur="4.62">Federal Energy Regulation Commission</text>
  <text start="2057.23" dur="5.37">found that just a handful of American</text>
  <text start="2060.38" dur="4.71">substations provide much of the</text>
  <text start="2062.6" dur="5.7">electricity that flows to large swaths</text>
  <text start="2065.09" dur="6.45">of the country disabling just nine of</text>
  <text start="2068.3" dur="5.879">these substations could leave much of</text>
  <text start="2071.54" dur="7.95">the country without power for weeks or</text>
  <text start="2074.179" dur="8.931">even months so right now what are we</text>

  <text start="2089.33" dur="6.21">did not say if but when they had the</text>
  <text start="2091.91" dur="7.02">grid to and guess what they are learning</text>
  <text start="2095.54" dur="7.05">they have learned how to bring down the</text>
  <text start="2098.93" dur="7.83">entire system they&amp;#39;ve done this because</text>
  <text start="2102.59" dur="6.78">they want to blame the entire collapse</text>
  <text start="2106.76" dur="4.83">on another country and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2109.37" dur="4.26">seeing this all come about right now and</text>
  <text start="2111.59" dur="4.92">this goes on to say that the power grid</text>
  <text start="2113.63" dur="5.43">built over many decades in a benign</text>
  <text start="2116.51" dur="6.78">environment now faces a range of threats</text>
  <text start="2119.06" dur="6.51">it was never designed to survive and</text>
  <text start="2123.29" dur="5.43">they are making us believe and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2125.57" dur="5.31">continually doing this they&amp;#39;re making us</text>
  <text start="2128.72" dur="5.07">believe that it will be coming from</text>
  <text start="2130.88" dur="4.95">another country and again we are</text>
  <text start="2133.79" dur="5.69">definitely going to see this and I just</text>
  <text start="2135.83" dur="5.91">wanted to say that when this happens</text>
  <text start="2139.48" dur="6.88">those people who do not</text>
  <text start="2141.74" dur="7.2">I have prep prep who haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="2146.36" dur="5.43">prepping are going to be in quite a bit</text>
  <text start="2148.94" dur="4.74">of trouble and this is why you should</text>
  <text start="2151.79" dur="4.92">have been prepping all along and if you</text>
  <text start="2153.68" dur="5.67">haven&amp;#39;t I would start with food water</text>
  <text start="2156.71" dur="4.92">batteries toiletries and again if you</text>
  <text start="2159.35" dur="4.59">have some type if you if you&amp;#39;re diabetic</text>

  <text start="2163.94" dur="3.03">like this</text>
  <text start="2164.72" dur="3.93">I would get extra medication at this</text>
  <text start="2166.97" dur="5.19">time and I&amp;#39;ve said this many many times</text>
  <text start="2168.65" dur="5.31">but we need to make sure that we are</text>
  <text start="2172.16" dur="3.33">safe because what&amp;#39;s going to happen you</text>
  <text start="2173.96" dur="3.57">want to protect your family because</text>
  <text start="2175.49" dur="4.56">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is those people</text>
  <text start="2177.53" dur="3.8">who haven&amp;#39;t been preparing are going</text>
  <text start="2180.05" dur="3.39">this is going to take them by surprise</text>
  <text start="2181.33" dur="3.039">they are not going to go they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2183.44" dur="3.21">going to understand what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="2184.369" dur="4.141">what&amp;#39;s happening and let me just say my</text>
  <text start="2186.65" dur="3.69">brother-in-law lives in Long Island he</text>
  <text start="2188.51" dur="2.67">was there during the hurricane when the</text>
  <text start="2190.34" dur="3.39">power went out</text>
  <text start="2191.18" dur="4.41">he lives along the water and he said it</text>
  <text start="2193.73" dur="4.44">was the scariest time he has ever had</text>
  <text start="2195.59" dur="5.1">everything was pitch dark and at night</text>
  <text start="2198.17" dur="5.85">all he heard and he doesn&amp;#39;t own any type</text>
  <text start="2200.69" dur="5.88">of weapon he had a bat all he heard were</text>
  <text start="2204.02" dur="5.64">windows breaking people breaking into</text>
  <text start="2206.57" dur="5.91">homes he heard people going up and down</text>
  <text start="2209.66" dur="5.55">the streets and they were in the house</text>
  <text start="2212.48" dur="5.22">dark with their candles with their bats</text>
  <text start="2215.21" dur="5.55">ready that to protect the family if</text>
  <text start="2217.7" dur="5.64">someone came in and he said it was very</text>
  <text start="2220.76" dur="4.83">very disturbing and when the lights go</text>
  <text start="2223.34" dur="5.13">out here it is going to be much much</text>
  <text start="2225.59" dur="4.74">worse because food delivery people won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2228.47" dur="4.05">be able to get money out and this is</text>
  <text start="2230.33" dur="5.1">going to go on for not three days not</text>
  <text start="2232.52" dur="5.79">four days weeks or months at a time and</text>
  <text start="2235.43" dur="5.13">again this is not going to turn out well</text>
  <text start="2238.31" dur="3.96">and I just want to make one note on this</text>
  <text start="2240.56" dur="4.59">Malaysian airliner that disappeared</text>
  <text start="2242.27" dur="4.61">there was a very interesting article on</text>
  <text start="2245.15" dur="7.44">American blog.com</text>
  <text start="2246.88" dur="8.26">there is a a small island about 2,000</text>
  <text start="2252.59" dur="4.83">miles or so away from where the airline</text>
  <text start="2255.14" dur="6.6">kind of disappeared is called Dao Garcia</text>
  <text start="2257.42" dur="6.449">and there is a runway strip there and I</text>
  <text start="2261.74" dur="4.89">think what&amp;#39;s happening here is that this</text>
  <text start="2263.869" dur="4.531">plane actually didn&amp;#39;t go down I think it</text>
  <text start="2266.63" dur="4.14">was hijacked I think it was taken to</text>
  <text start="2268.4" dur="5.19">another place maybe for one or two</text>
  <text start="2270.77" dur="4.46">reasons one maybe to strip it down and</text>
  <text start="2273.59" dur="4.94">sell the parts</text>
  <text start="2275.23" dur="6.24">yeah or the other I think this is going</text>
  <text start="2278.53" dur="7.05">to be used in a terrorist type of attack</text>
  <text start="2281.47" dur="6.69">later on and again you can I have this</text>

  <text start="2303.25" dur="3.75">us in the wrong direction they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2304.78" dur="4.65">pointing us to Sri Lanka where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2307" dur="4.89">known terrorists there and they might</text>
  <text start="2309.43" dur="5.34">have taken the plane and they might be</text>
  <text start="2311.89" dur="5.37">using it for a terrorist attack later on</text>
  <text start="2314.77" dur="4.08">and I believe that is true but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
