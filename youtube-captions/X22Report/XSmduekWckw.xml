  <text start="141.15" dur="4.47">for their plans and all of those</text>
  <text start="143.1" dur="4.65">staffers most of them have taken the</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="4.23">gold plan because they&amp;#39;re not paying for</text>

  <text start="173.13" dur="6.69">out there to push this on the people</text>
  <text start="176.97" dur="5.82">just like Obama has been doing it would</text>
  <text start="179.82" dur="5.49">be something that everybody wants and</text>
  <text start="182.79" dur="5.25">everyone would rush to get to it when</text>
  <text start="185.31" dur="4.86">you create something good and create</text>
  <text start="188.04" dur="6.33">something that everybody wants people</text>
  <text start="190.17" dur="5.85">run to it a good example and I know</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="3.45">everyone doesn&amp;#39;t like Apple and the</text>
  <text start="196.02" dur="4.41">iphone but they created an incredible</text>
  <text start="197.82" dur="4.32">product it worked really well they</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="3.27">created a new technology where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.14" dur="4.53">able to swipe your finger and move</text>
  <text start="203.7" dur="5.13">things up and down people ran to it if</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="5.1">they didn&amp;#39;t like it they wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="208.83" dur="6">done it for government if they create</text>
  <text start="211.77" dur="5.91">something that is that great they</text>
  <text start="214.83" dur="5.61">wouldn&amp;#39;t have to impose penalties they</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="7.29">wouldn&amp;#39;t have to penalize you if you</text>
  <text start="220.44" dur="7.59">don&amp;#39;t take it now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="4.98">NSA is spying on all of us and we</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="4.56">understand that you know it&amp;#39;s put in</text>
  <text start="229.95" dur="5.55">place to stop terrorists and what has</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="4.5">come out of here is that pressed by the</text>
  <text start="235.5" dur="3.93">democratic chairman of the Senate</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="5.3">Judiciary Committee and an oversight</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="6.24">hearing general Keith be Alexander</text>
  <text start="242.39" dur="5.59">admitted that the number of terrorist</text>
  <text start="245.67" dur="5.64">plots foiled by the NSA&amp;#39;s huge database</text>
  <text start="247.98" dur="7.05">of every phone call made in America was</text>
  <text start="251.31" dur="7.83">only maybe two at the most or maybe just</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="6.15">one and remember if you remember way</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="4.44">back when they first this whole thing</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="5.67">was broken and Snowden came out they</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="4.86">said there were 54 that were stopped and</text>
  <text start="266.85" dur="4.77">we can see this and I&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="268.44" dur="6.84">this since this happened they are not</text>
  <text start="271.62" dur="7.019">spying on Americans and people outside</text>
  <text start="275.28" dur="5.85">of the country for terrorists they are</text>
  <text start="278.639" dur="5.041">building list they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="281.13" dur="5.009">connections they are building social</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="5.16">graphs to understand how everyone is</text>
  <text start="286.139" dur="5.011">connected if you are connected to some</text>
  <text start="288.84" dur="4.41">type of dimeric domestic terrorist group</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="5.43">this is why they have these private</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="5.72">lists this is why you can&amp;#39;t get off of</text>
  <text start="296.58" dur="6.03">it you don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;re on it and</text>
  <text start="298.97" dur="7.99">even chris christie is using this list</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="6.69">with one of his gun control laws that if</text>
  <text start="306.96" dur="3.959">you are on this list that you can you</text>
  <text start="309.3" dur="3.089">know that you don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;re on it</text>
  <text start="310.919" dur="3.901">or not and you can&amp;#39;t get off of it and</text>
  <text start="312.389" dur="6.271">there&amp;#39;s no way to get off of it you</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="5.659">cannot get a gun permit and we can see</text>
  <text start="318.66" dur="6">that this whole entire thing the whole</text>
  <text start="320.479" dur="6.341">NSA spying was about keeping track of</text>
  <text start="324.66" dur="4.56">the people because when the collapse</text>
  <text start="326.82" dur="4.65">comes they need to know who is going to</text>
  <text start="329.22" dur="3.96">be the troublemaker who is going to give</text>
  <text start="331.47" dur="4.11">them problems and it makes it a lot</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="5.01">easier for them to pick up these people</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="6.33">in the beginning when the collapse</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="6.69">occurs it is also being used to steal</text>
  <text start="341.91" dur="6.42">patent ideas investment information and</text>
  <text start="344.88" dur="8.58">to blackmail government officials like</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="8.55">judges Senators Congressmen into doing</text>
  <text start="353.46" dur="8.07">what they want this is why this has been</text>
  <text start="356.88" dur="6.99">put into place now James James clapper</text>
  <text start="361.53" dur="4.199">denied that a number of plots foiled</text>
  <text start="363.87" dur="4.079">should be the sole metric by which the</text>
  <text start="365.729" dur="4.351">success of the program is measured you</text>
  <text start="367.949" dur="4.621">know we should just look at that what he</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="5.369">thinks that there&amp;#39;s another metric here</text>
  <text start="372.57" dur="6.15">that&amp;#39;s very important and it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="375.449" dur="5.611">the peace of mind metric which is a</text>
  <text start="378.72" dur="6.569">bunch of BS because what do we</text>
  <text start="381.06" dur="6.6">understand these terrorist plots and the</text>
  <text start="385.289" dur="5.581">things that are occurring here in the US</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="7.14">and around the world are created by the</text>
  <text start="390.87" dur="7.71">central bankers US government Israel</text>
  <text start="394.8" dur="7.29">they use these to get what they want</text>
  <text start="398.58" dur="7.1">they use 911 to get into Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="402.09" dur="6.12">they use 911 to cover up</text>
  <text start="405.68" dur="6.04">corruption and the solon trillion</text>
  <text start="408.21" dur="6.75">dollars of money they used the Boston</text>
  <text start="411.72" dur="7.31">bombing to create an atmosphere of</text>
  <text start="414.96" dur="8.55">terror they used the Kenya the kenya</text>
  <text start="419.03" dur="7.66">mall attack in nairobi because Kenya was</text>
  <text start="423.51" dur="5.07">signing the deal with China to become</text>
  <text start="426.69" dur="5.49">the clearinghouse for you on which will</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="7.23">bypass the US dollar they are using all</text>
  <text start="432.18" dur="7.23">of this to get what they want they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="435.81" dur="7.14">used the false flag in Syria to get a</text>
  <text start="439.41" dur="5.31">war going this is what it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="442.95" dur="5.73">and it has nothing to do with peace of</text>
  <text start="444.72" dur="6.48">mind because it is them who who creates</text>
  <text start="448.68" dur="4.38">the terror they&amp;#39;re the ones who created</text>
  <text start="451.2" dur="3.6">the terrorist groups and they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="453.06" dur="6.27">ones who are doing this because they</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="6.5">understand they need to keep control of</text>
  <text start="459.33" dur="6.21">the people and the way to do it is to</text>
  <text start="461.3" dur="6.49">use this new technique called terror and</text>
  <text start="465.54" dur="3.84">everyone gets scared everyone doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.79" dur="3.84">mind their liberties being taken away</text>
  <text start="469.38" dur="6.75">they don&amp;#39;t might be strip-searched they</text>
  <text start="471.63" dur="7.29">don&amp;#39;t mind their privacy being eroded</text>
  <text start="476.13" dur="5.16">away nobody cares about it all in the</text>
  <text start="478.92" dur="5.46">name of keeping me safe and it is</text>
  <text start="481.29" dur="4.71">completely against what the Constitution</text>
  <text start="484.38" dur="4.02">stands for this is what the Constitution</text>
  <text start="486" dur="7.29">was created for it was so the government</text>
  <text start="488.4" dur="7.5">could not do this now we see DARPA has</text>
  <text start="493.29" dur="4.83">created this four-legged Wildcat robot</text>
  <text start="495.9" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;ve seen this in the past it was in</text>
  <text start="498.12" dur="4.98">the lab all tied up to electrical cords</text>
  <text start="500.76" dur="7.08">giving it power but now we see it</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="8.07">outside running on his all four legs</text>
  <text start="507.84" dur="4.71">just like a wildcat animal and they did</text>
  <text start="511.17" dur="3.9">a little demonstration I have the video</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="4.95">here on the x 22 report site but I was</text>
  <text start="515.07" dur="4.41">thinking I mean they understand I</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="5.7">understand that they are going to use</text>
  <text start="519.48" dur="7.22">this type of Wildcat type of machinery</text>
  <text start="523.2" dur="7.59">out in the military where it could carry</text>
  <text start="526.7" dur="7.36">equipment for the military but this also</text>
  <text start="530.79" dur="5.16">could be modified we have in a way where</text>
  <text start="534.06" dur="4.8">we have drones in the air and they</text>
  <text start="535.95" dur="6.66">modify these remote control</text>
  <text start="538.86" dur="6.39">lying devices with cameras you can put</text>
  <text start="542.61" dur="6.45">weapons on them we also can see that</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="6.24">they this can also be a land drone where</text>
  <text start="549.06" dur="4.68">they put cameras and weapons on these</text>
  <text start="551.49" dur="5.04">land drones and it reminds me very much</text>
  <text start="553.74" dur="6.18">of Terminator the movie where these</text>
  <text start="556.53" dur="5.13">robots are I mean right now the</text>
  <text start="559.92" dur="4.35">artificial intelligence and all that is</text>
  <text start="561.66" dur="6.72">not where it needs to be but you can see</text>
  <text start="564.27" dur="7.38">that there DHS local authorities could</text>
  <text start="568.38" dur="6.6">use these type of devices mount cameras</text>
  <text start="571.65" dur="7.05">on them mount weapons on them and use</text>
  <text start="574.98" dur="5.34">these by remote control to herd the</text>
  <text start="578.7" dur="3.6">people where they want them to go and</text>
  <text start="580.32" dur="5.09">you can definitely see that this is a</text>
  <text start="582.3" dur="5.85">huge possibility that that could happen</text>
  <text start="585.41" dur="6.6">now there was an interesting article in</text>
  <text start="588.15" dur="6.9">the rockland times and it was a</text>
  <text start="592.01" dur="5.62">something that has to do with Homeland</text>

  <text start="746.7" dur="8.99">completely agree with him they would be</text>
  <text start="749.04" dur="10.32">appalled now Kissinger Henry Kissinger</text>
  <text start="755.69" dur="6.7">two years ago was interviewed and it was</text>
  <text start="759.36" dur="5.01">kind of lost in the shuffle and there</text>
  <text start="762.39" dur="4.71">are very interesting things that come</text>
  <text start="764.37" dur="6.3">out of this interview of what has been</text>
  <text start="767.1" dur="6.66">happening today and what you can see how</text>
  <text start="770.67" dur="4.95">their plan is all coming together it</text>
  <text start="773.76" dur="3.84">might be delayed a little bit like they</text>
  <text start="775.62" dur="4.65">were supposed to get into Syria but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="777.6" dur="6.18">a little bit delayed but let me just go</text>
  <text start="780.27" dur="7.2">through some of this this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="783.78" dur="6.54">has the storm around Syria subsided if</text>
  <text start="787.47" dur="4.89">so why has the United States until</text>
  <text start="790.32" dur="4.02">recently insisted on the inclusion in</text>
  <text start="792.36" dur="4.86">the text of the UN resolution on</text>
  <text start="794.34" dur="6.96">chemical weapons of a provision on the</text>
  <text start="797.22" dur="8.45">possibility of using an army and having</text>
  <text start="801.3" dur="6.29">a military strike rush</text>
  <text start="805.67" dur="6.51">President Putin mentioned that he asked</text>
  <text start="807.59" dur="7.65">the Americans Barack Obama what the US</text>
  <text start="812.18" dur="5.43">wanted to to achieve in Syria and he</text>
  <text start="815.24" dur="5.55">didn&amp;#39;t get a clear answer from President</text>
  <text start="817.61" dur="6.93">Obama and this speech that Kissinger</text>
  <text start="820.79" dur="8.37">made around two years ago this is what</text>
  <text start="824.54" dur="8.37">he said war um why is the war in</text>
  <text start="829.16" dur="6.24">evitable who will launch it Kissinger</text>
  <text start="832.91" dur="6.12">was candid in saying that the United</text>
  <text start="835.4" dur="6.59">States was luring China and Russia in a</text>
  <text start="839.03" dur="8.13">trap and the final nail in the coffin</text>
  <text start="841.99" dur="7.15">would be Iran the main goal of Israel he</text>
  <text start="847.16" dur="4.62">concluded by saying that one who</text>
  <text start="849.14" dur="9.87">controls the oil the government and the</text>
  <text start="851.78" dur="10.17">food controls the people conditions at</text>
  <text start="859.01" dur="5.79">this stage are secondary compared to the</text>
  <text start="861.95" dur="5.82">main goal to neutralize including by</text>
  <text start="864.8" dur="6.27">means of armed force and a world war the</text>
  <text start="867.77" dur="6.99">tune the two main geo political rivals</text>
  <text start="871.07" dur="5.97">Russia and China the goal is to show who</text>
  <text start="874.76" dur="5.48">remains a self-sufficient and</text>
  <text start="877.04" dur="6.12">uncontrolled master of the globe</text>
  <text start="880.24" dur="5.17">Kissinger was frank about it saying that</text>
  <text start="883.16" dur="4.86">the American military were told that it</text>
  <text start="885.41" dur="4.71">was necessary to capture seven Middle</text>
  <text start="888.02" dur="4.53">Eastern countries and take over their</text>
  <text start="890.12" dur="4.92">resources and they had nearly completed</text>
  <text start="892.55" dur="5.91">this task he said that a new society and</text>
  <text start="895.04" dur="5.94">a new world order would be created there</text>
  <text start="898.46" dur="5.52">will be only one superpower and will be</text>
  <text start="900.98" dur="4.83">the winning World Government seven</text>
  <text start="903.98" dur="3.81">Middle Eastern countries mentioned by</text>
  <text start="905.81" dur="6.6">Kissinger included Saudi Arabia Kuwait</text>
  <text start="907.79" dur="6.47">on the UAE Iraq Syria Libya and Iran the</text>
  <text start="912.41" dur="5.13">task indeed would have been virtually</text>
  <text start="914.26" dur="5.53">completed had Washington attack Syria</text>
  <text start="917.54" dur="6.3">and put it under its control according</text>
  <text start="919.79" dur="6.99">to the Iraqi model that they created and</text>
  <text start="923.84" dur="6.21">it goes on have these strategic plans</text>
  <text start="926.78" dur="6.09">been abandoned absolutely not the fight</text>
  <text start="930.05" dur="5.22">is only beginning as too much resources</text>
  <text start="932.87" dur="5.37">and expectations are associated with</text>
  <text start="935.27" dur="3.84">this vector of foreign policy and they</text>
  <text start="938.24" dur="4.65">have not</text>
  <text start="939.11" dur="7.2">the plan is still the same the only</text>
  <text start="942.89" dur="7.56">difference it is how it&amp;#39;s been delayed</text>
  <text start="946.31" dur="7.29">and in the resolution with Assad they</text>
  <text start="950.45" dur="6.21">did leave in chapter 7 and Article 42</text>
  <text start="953.6" dur="6.03">says if everything if all else fails</text>
  <text start="956.66" dur="11.13">they could use some type of force by</text>
  <text start="959.63" dur="11.04">land air or sea ok now the because of</text>
  <text start="967.79" dur="4.919">the shutdown right now the cyber defense</text>
  <text start="970.67" dur="5.82">initiative which was a six billion</text>
  <text start="972.709" dur="9.511">dollar project has been put on hold and</text>
  <text start="976.49" dur="9.12">this project was to secure the the whole</text>
  <text start="982.22" dur="5.94">cyber infrastructure with businesses and</text>
  <text start="985.61" dur="5.61">government and now since this has been</text>
  <text start="988.16" dur="4.98">put on hold because of the shutdown they</text>
  <text start="991.22" dur="5.299">are saying we are very very vulnerable</text>
  <text start="993.14" dur="6.12">at this point to a cyber attack and</text>
  <text start="996.519" dur="6.221">former Deputy Secretary of Defense</text>
  <text start="999.26" dur="5.759">William jail in describes the cyber</text>
  <text start="1002.74" dur="6.5">attack of being in three different</text>
  <text start="1005.019" dur="9.711">stages and he goes on to say that first</text>
  <text start="1009.24" dur="8.68">stage of cyber attacks was the theft of</text>
  <text start="1014.73" dur="7.479">information or the theft of money and</text>
  <text start="1017.92" dur="8.009">things like that the next phase of cyber</text>
  <text start="1022.209" dur="5.46">attacks is disruption of services like</text>
  <text start="1025.929" dur="3.801">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing with websites and</text>
  <text start="1027.669" dur="5.371">stuff like that where they do a DoD</text>
  <text start="1029.73" dur="7.359">denial service attack I mean a do s and</text>
  <text start="1033.04" dur="9.48">you see the websites completely go down</text>
  <text start="1037.089" dur="8.1">and nothing can be no functions on the</text>
  <text start="1042.52" dur="5.669">website are actually functional now</text>
  <text start="1045.189" dur="5.041">we&amp;#39;ve seen Adobe get hit now where they</text>
  <text start="1048.189" dur="4.98">were able to take the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1050.23" dur="5.79">information plus their personal and</text>
  <text start="1053.169" dur="5.071">credit card information recently we have</text>
  <text start="1056.02" dur="4.83">seen websites being brought down where</text>
  <text start="1058.24" dur="6.569">they&amp;#39;re not operational anymore and what</text>
  <text start="1060.85" dur="7.44">he says is the next step to a successful</text>
  <text start="1064.809" dur="5.761">cyber attack and he goes we and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1068.29" dur="4.68">reasonable to believe that we are right</text>
  <text start="1070.57" dur="6.9">there now is that this</text>
  <text start="1072.97" dur="7.23">production of us infrastructure and he</text>
  <text start="1077.47" dur="5.37">went on to say when and where is very</text>
  <text start="1080.2" dur="5.07">difficult to say when this will occur</text>
  <text start="1082.84" dur="6.089">but we are at the point where a</text>
  <text start="1085.27" dur="6.389">cyberattack could bring down the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1088.929" dur="7.771">infrastructure and we do understand they</text>
  <text start="1091.659" dur="7.741">are holding drills for this one in</text>
  <text start="1096.7" dur="4.859">November which is the power grid drill</text>
  <text start="1099.4" dur="7.44">to test the infrastructure against</text>
  <text start="1101.559" dur="7.221">physical and cyber attack attacks and we</text>
  <text start="1106.84" dur="4.86">also understand that there is a</text>
  <text start="1108.78" dur="5.08">cyberattack drill in the month of</text>
