  <text start="131.43" dur="4.919">they&amp;#39;re doing nothing is working out the</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="5.31">world is waking up to what they are</text>
  <text start="136.349" dur="4.791">doing and we can see that they are being</text>
  <text start="139.08" dur="4.55">pushed into the</text>
  <text start="141.14" dur="5.819">corner of the room and the only way out</text>
  <text start="143.63" dur="6.06">of this is to have some type of an event</text>
  <text start="146.959" dur="4.441">and this is wide with this report that</text>
  <text start="149.69" dur="4.08">the US State Department is shipping</text>
  <text start="151.4" dur="5.94">explosives to unknown unknown locations</text>
  <text start="153.77" dur="6.93">is very important because they are about</text>
  <text start="157.34" dur="6.15">to do something very big because what is</text>
  <text start="160.7" dur="5.49">left here I mean we understand in Libya</text>
  <text start="163.49" dur="4.44">the Libyan government the puppet regime</text>
  <text start="166.19" dur="4.11">their cold out and said listen we need</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="4.26">international help and that gave the</text>
  <text start="170.3" dur="3.81">United States a foot in the door to</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="4.41">bring in troops and to have you know</text>
  <text start="174.11" dur="3.93">NATO come in to have the UN come in and</text>
  <text start="176.6" dur="4.29">help out there because the people of</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="4.89">Libya are taking over the country but if</text>
  <text start="180.89" dur="4.29">we look around this is really getting</text>
  <text start="182.93" dur="4.26">out of hand for them and everything is</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="4.279">falling apart and the economy here in</text>
  <text start="187.19" dur="4.44">the United States is completely</text>
  <text start="189.459" dur="4.601">deteriorating every single day and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.63" dur="4.59">getting worse Europe is a complete</text>
  <text start="194.06" dur="4.2">disaster and it&amp;#39;s going to be like a</text>
  <text start="196.22" dur="3.989">domino effect that&amp;#39;s going to start in</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="4.199">Europe it&amp;#39;s going to spread all over the</text>
  <text start="200.209" dur="4.231">place and it&amp;#39;s going to finally hit the</text>
  <text start="202.459" dur="4.471">United States and everything&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="5.1">start collapsing one by one and of</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="4.619">course we always know that before the</text>
  <text start="209.54" dur="4.38">collapse what they try to do is they go</text>
  <text start="211.549" dur="3.601">after everyone&amp;#39;s money wherever they</text>
  <text start="213.92" dur="3.12">possibly can and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="215.15" dur="3.839">coming up with the new laws like FATCA</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="3.69">the going across the ocean looking at</text>
  <text start="218.989" dur="4.681">the baked accounts taxing those people</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="4.259">who are working in a company in another</text>
  <text start="223.67" dur="4.17">country and living in another country</text>
  <text start="224.989" dur="4.681">but have a u.s. passport and we can see</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="4.08">that people are saying listen I can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="229.67" dur="5.52">taxed twice here I just can&amp;#39;t make it so</text>
  <text start="231.92" dur="5.159">I will renounce my citizenship and the</text>
  <text start="235.19" dur="5.25">United States government is going to</text>
  <text start="237.079" dur="4.801">continually go after more and more money</text>
  <text start="240.44" dur="3.9">because they do not have the revenue</text>
  <text start="241.88" dur="4.32">coming in to sustain the debt and</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="4.02">everything that they&amp;#39;re trying to do at</text>
  <text start="246.2" dur="4.2">this point and what we are seeing right</text>
  <text start="248.36" dur="4.95">now is on November first the Internet</text>
  <text start="250.4" dur="5.76">Tax Freedom Act is due to expire and</text>
  <text start="253.31" dur="5.04">this was put into place back in 1998 and</text>
  <text start="256.16" dur="5.669">it was renewed about three times and</text>
  <text start="258.35" dur="5.52">this prohibits taxes that discriminate</text>
  <text start="261.829" dur="4.321">against the Internet basically you</text>
  <text start="263.87" dur="4.65">really can&amp;#39;t apply taxes to the Internet</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="4.68">and we see this is coming up and what</text>
  <text start="268.52" dur="5.36">they would like to do is not have this</text>
  <text start="270.83" dur="4.32">law in place so they can completely tax</text>
  <text start="273.88" dur="2.83">everything</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="4.02">on the internet and bring in an</text>
  <text start="276.71" dur="3.9">additional revenue stream and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.17" dur="5.07">going to have to see what happens this</text>
  <text start="280.61" dur="5.7">is coming up again and this goes forward</text>
  <text start="284.24" dur="3.51">you will see taxes pretty much</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="5.43">everywhere every time you turn on your</text>
  <text start="287.75" dur="6.12">computer and enter into the internet you</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="4.17">will be taxed going to certain sites you</text>
  <text start="293.87" dur="4.77">most likely will be taxed making</text>
  <text start="295.91" dur="5.31">purchases you&amp;#39;ll be taxed and we will</text>
  <text start="298.64" dur="8.07">have to see how this plays out in the</text>
  <text start="301.22" dur="9.35">next months ahead here now we understand</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="6.9">that the housing market is pretty much</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="4.63">imploding on itself right now and out of</text>
  <text start="313.61" dur="3.57">MarketWatch they had a very interesting</text>
  <text start="315.2" dur="4.5">article where they talked about the</text>
  <text start="317.18" dur="4.8">Millennials and how they&amp;#39;re hurting the</text>
  <text start="319.7" dur="5.31">real estate market and of course they</text>
  <text start="321.98" dur="5.64">are because the Millennials make up the</text>
  <text start="325.01" dur="4.77">the youth of America from 18 to 29 those</text>
  <text start="327.62" dur="4.56">people that are coming out of college or</text>
  <text start="329.78" dur="4.71">just graduating high school they have</text>
  <text start="332.18" dur="4.47">they have a very difficult time finding</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="4.14">work out there they can&amp;#39;t they look</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="3.96">around they can&amp;#39;t find work they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="338.63" dur="5.4">sending resumes out a couple reports</text>
  <text start="340.61" dur="6.12">back I discussed how many students are</text>
  <text start="344.03" dur="4.47">looking for work but cannot find work</text>
  <text start="346.73" dur="4.38">and I think it&amp;#39;s around eighty percent</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="5.22">or so they&amp;#39;re sending out resumes</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="4.53">nothing&amp;#39;s coming back and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="353.72" dur="4.86">stuck here and this went on to say that</text>
  <text start="355.64" dur="5.1">these are the reasons why the real</text>
  <text start="358.58" dur="4.47">estate market is not going to go</text>
  <text start="360.74" dur="5.76">anywhere and actually it&amp;#39;s going to make</text>
  <text start="363.05" dur="5.82">it worse as time goes on it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="366.5" dur="5.46">the Millennials have lack of savings</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="5.85">less than perfect credit and stifling</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="5.67">loads of student loan debt and they are</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="5.49">continually may it&amp;#39;s continually making</text>
  <text start="377.63" dur="5.58">it harder and harder for them to get</text>
  <text start="380.21" dur="6.24">anywhere and this is true I i see this I</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="5.85">see that these youth who are coming out</text>
  <text start="386.45" dur="5.28">of college I mean if you have a student</text>
  <text start="389.06" dur="4.89">loan and you&amp;#39;ve been trying to work and</text>
  <text start="391.73" dur="4.83">you&amp;#39;ve been sending out your resume and</text>
  <text start="393.95" dur="4.53">you have no income coming in you can</text>
  <text start="396.56" dur="3.93">understand that they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="398.48" dur="4.47">save the money they&amp;#39;re not going to have</text>
  <text start="400.49" dur="4.02">any money to put down on a house they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="3.87">not going to have any money to go and</text>
  <text start="404.51" dur="4.019">purchase things in the stores like</text>
  <text start="406.82" dur="4.229">electronics TVs</text>
  <text start="408.529" dur="5.07">DVD players they&amp;#39;re not going to do any</text>
  <text start="411.049" dur="5.54">of this and this is getting worse and</text>
  <text start="413.599" dur="5.42">worse as time goes on because if this</text>
  <text start="416.589" dur="4.9">group of students graduating this year</text>
  <text start="419.019" dur="5.08">can&amp;#39;t find a job and they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="421.489" dur="3.81">part-time or they can&amp;#39;t find work at all</text>
  <text start="424.099" dur="3.48">and they&amp;#39;re living with their parents</text>
  <text start="425.299" dur="4.68">what&amp;#39;s going to happen with the next</text>
  <text start="427.579" dur="4.17">wave and the wave after this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.979" dur="3.84">getting worse it&amp;#39;s not getting better</text>
  <text start="431.749" dur="4.05">and this goes on to say that the absence</text>
  <text start="433.819" dur="4.08">of young adults from the housing market</text>
  <text start="435.799" dur="3.87">continues to put a dent in the</text>
  <text start="437.899" dur="3.87">homeownership rate which dropped to</text>
  <text start="439.669" dur="4.59">about sixty four point eight percent in</text>
  <text start="441.769" dur="5.31">the first quarter the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="444.259" dur="4.17">for 18 to 29 year-olds is around fifteen</text>
  <text start="447.079" dur="3.09">percent now these are the government</text>
  <text start="448.429" dur="5.43">numbers I&amp;#39;m going to say this is more</text>
  <text start="450.169" dur="5.04">like 50 around fifty percent or so for</text>
  <text start="453.859" dur="3.18">real unemployment because if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.209" dur="4.53">looking at eighty percent cannot find</text>
  <text start="457.039" dur="4.29">work after graduating college it is way</text>
  <text start="459.739" dur="3.96">higher than fifteen percent here</text>
  <text start="461.329" dur="5.03">twenty-nine percent of young adults</text>
  <text start="463.699" dur="5.07">younger than 35 live with their parents</text>
  <text start="466.359" dur="4.6">according to the Gallup poll results</text>
  <text start="468.769" dur="4.95">they have insufficient asses to cover</text>
  <text start="470.959" dur="5.84">even a five percent down payment and</text>
  <text start="473.719" dur="6.21">this is why we see the government now</text>
  <text start="476.799" dur="6.07">instructing and the Fed instructing the</text>
  <text start="479.929" dur="4.77">banks to lower the deposit rate on</text>
  <text start="482.869" dur="3.48">purchasing a home they won from twenty</text>
  <text start="484.699" dur="3.69">to twenty-five percent down to five</text>
  <text start="486.349" dur="3.96">percent summer at three and they&amp;#39;re even</text>
  <text start="488.389" dur="4.85">some at zero because they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="490.309" dur="6.54">realize oh my god these youths they have</text>
  <text start="493.239" dur="5.23">no work they have no money saved the</text>
  <text start="496.849" dur="3.42">ones that are working because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="498.469" dur="3.9">not getting the same salary and they</text>
  <text start="500.269" dur="5.01">just can&amp;#39;t buy a house so we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="502.369" dur="4.79">really have to give the house away just</text>
  <text start="505.279" dur="4.38">to get these houses moving here and</text>
  <text start="507.159" dur="5.38">people with student loan debt also have</text>
  <text start="509.659" dur="5.28">more education which should pay off in</text>
  <text start="512.539" dur="5.31">higher incomes in the future and make</text>
  <text start="514.939" dur="5.01">them great mortgage applicants but when</text>
  <text start="517.849" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re first starting out having more</text>
  <text start="519.949" dur="5.07">student loan debt makes it harder to get</text>
  <text start="522.769" dur="4.26">a mortgage and paying loan installments</text>
  <text start="525.019" dur="5.221">each month makes it more difficult to</text>
  <text start="527.029" dur="4.581">save for a down payment and this is why</text>
  <text start="530.24" dur="4.589">we see the government out there</text>
  <text start="531.61" dur="4.389">modifying and deferring student loan</text>
  <text start="534.829" dur="2.94">payments because they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="535.999" dur="4.68">realize which they kind of know all</text>
  <text start="537.769" dur="4.94">along that these students cannot find</text>
  <text start="540.679" dur="4.291">work and there</text>
  <text start="542.709" dur="3.67">defaulting on their student loans so</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re saying listen if you</text>
  <text start="546.379" dur="6.24">need help we&amp;#39;ll help you reorganize and</text>
  <text start="549.8" dur="4.379">modify your loan and make the payments</text>
  <text start="552.619" dur="4.111">longer make it so you don&amp;#39;t have to make</text>
  <text start="554.179" dur="4.921">payments right now and the government</text>
  <text start="556.73" dur="4.56">receives so many people applying for</text>
  <text start="559.1" dur="4.799">this that they they were getting</text>
  <text start="561.29" dur="6.63">overloaded and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="563.899" dur="5.31">now is that in 2012 1.3 million students</text>
  <text start="567.92" dur="4.409">who graduated from a four-year college</text>
  <text start="569.209" dur="6.091">or seventy one percent has student loan</text>
  <text start="572.329" dur="5.25">debt up from 1.1 million in two thousand</text>
  <text start="575.3" dur="4.92">eight and nine hundred thousand and two</text>
  <text start="577.579" dur="4.38">thousand four so the number of students</text>
  <text start="580.22" dur="3.929">that come out of school have more and</text>
  <text start="581.959" dur="4.591">more debt they have to take out the</text>
  <text start="584.149" dur="4.021">student loans and it&amp;#39;s getting worse as</text>
  <text start="586.55" dur="3.659">time goes on so they can&amp;#39;t find jobs</text>
  <text start="588.17" dur="4.38">they have more debt they have no</text>
  <text start="590.209" dur="4.44">disposable income they&amp;#39;re living with</text>
  <text start="592.55" dur="5.42">their parents and eighty percent of them</text>
  <text start="594.649" dur="6.331">cannot find work this is going nowhere</text>
  <text start="597.97" dur="5.44">this is going to completely implode on</text>
  <text start="600.98" dur="4.349">itself and there is no way out and this</text>
  <text start="603.41" dur="4.139">is why the fed has instructed those</text>
  <text start="605.329" dur="4.5">hedge funds and investment companies to</text>
  <text start="607.549" dur="4.35">continually by those homes in cash</text>

  <text start="673.669" dur="2.341">their taxes we need to go right into</text>

  <text start="1057.91" dur="7.05">from the youth it&amp;#39;s not happening why</text>
  <text start="1061.12" dur="5.67">because they don&amp;#39;t have jobs and those</text>

  <text start="1079.36" dur="4.02">I ever get sick I don&amp;#39;t need this and</text>
  <text start="1080.86" dur="4.11">when I was young that&amp;#39;s how I thought I</text>

  <text start="1084.97" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t even give two thoughts about</text>
  <text start="1086.26" dur="4.89">health insurance so they&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="1088.36" dur="7.56">the revenue increase from the youth of</text>
  <text start="1091.15" dur="8.19">America at this time okay now out in the</text>
  <text start="1095.92" dur="7.2">EU in the UK it looks like they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1099.34" dur="7.83">to put a tracker chip in every single</text>
  <text start="1103.12" dur="6.48">car under EU plans every new car sold in</text>
  <text start="1107.17" dur="4.43">UK will have a black box they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="1119.95" dur="5.34">but you know that this will not only be</text>
  <text start="1122.65" dur="4.95">for emergencies the government will also</text>
  <text start="1125.29" dur="5.73">use it to track you to know where you</text>
  <text start="1127.6" dur="5.61">are just like the NSA spying is just for</text>

  <text start="1845.5" dur="5.549">to coordinate efforts to overthrow Assad</text>
  <text start="1848.02" dur="5.159">and he carry lamented that the lack of</text>
  <text start="1851.049" dur="5.341">coordination had dramatically setback</text>
  <text start="1853.179" dur="5.341">the drive to remove Assad from power and</text>
  <text start="1856.39" dur="4.32">we can see what is happening at this</text>
  <text start="1858.52" dur="5.94">point in time they are funneling</text>
  <text start="1860.71" dur="5.91">anti-aircraft anti-tank weapons they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1864.46" dur="4.11">been training people in guitar and in</text>

  <text start="1868.57" dur="5.229">their final push and move into Syria at</text>
  <text start="1871.69" dur="5.66">this time and of course they</text>

  <text start="1877.35" dur="5.01">and he&amp;#39;s saying that every all the</text>
  <text start="1880.29" dur="6.3">evidence that he&amp;#39;s seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="1882.36" dur="7.25">pointing to another 911 type of an event</text>
  <text start="1886.59" dur="7.98">that is headed our way and most likely</text>
  <text start="1889.61" dur="7.18">it will be coming from Syria and he can</text>
  <text start="1894.57" dur="5.55">saying that because of Syria being the</text>
  <text start="1896.79" dur="5.7">launch pad for al-qaeda we can see that</text>
  <text start="1900.12" dur="4.5">something is being planned something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1902.49" dur="4.309">being maneuvered to have something</text>
  <text start="1904.62" dur="5.1">happen here in the United States and</text>
  <text start="1906.799" dur="5.441">he&amp;#39;s saying that this will be coming</text>
  <text start="1909.72" dur="5.459">very soon as things start to break apart</text>
  <text start="1912.24" dur="6.09">and Assad gains more and more power in</text>
  <text start="1915.179" dur="4.62">Syria we can see something happening</text>
  <text start="1918.33" dur="3.27">here in the United States and of course</text>
  <text start="1919.799" dur="3.601">they&amp;#39;re building and building this up</text>
  <text start="1921.6" dur="4.68">and they&amp;#39;re telling us that something</text>
  <text start="1923.4" dur="5.58">will be coming we don&amp;#39;t know how or when</text>
  <text start="1926.28" dur="4.86">but it will be some type of an a 911</text>
  <text start="1928.98" dur="6.24">event and we understand that they need</text>
  <text start="1931.14" dur="6.3">this event to completely cover up this</text>
  <text start="1935.22" dur="4.89">economic collapse and they also need to</text>
  <text start="1937.44" dur="5.25">make their power move into Syria and</text>
  <text start="1940.11" dur="6.96">this will be the way they will be able</text>
  <text start="1942.69" dur="8.19">to do it at this time now DHS is</text>
  <text start="1947.07" dur="6.9">allowing terror suspects into the</text>
  <text start="1950.88" dur="6.27">country and Senator Grassley is seeking</text>
  <text start="1953.97" dur="5.4">more information about DHS&amp;#39;s hands off</text>
  <text start="1957.15" dur="5.55">list the Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="1959.37" dur="5.46">secretly assembled a terrorist hands off</text>
  <text start="1962.7" dur="4.77">list that permitted individuals with</text>
  <text start="1964.83" dur="4.08">terrorist ties unfettered entrance into</text>
  <text start="1967.47" dur="2.97">the United States i did this report</text>
  <text start="1968.91" dur="3.45">quite a while where I said they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1970.44" dur="4.2">bussing them in and this is still going</text>
  <text start="1972.36" dur="4.02">on they&amp;#39;re having these people of course</text>
  <text start="1974.64" dur="3.419">because they&amp;#39;re going to stage this</text>
  <text start="1976.38" dur="5.19">event here in the country and they need</text>
  <text start="1978.059" dur="5.701">them inside the country already to push</text>
  <text start="1981.57" dur="5.37">these plans forward because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1983.76" dur="5.13">going to hit many many spots all at once</text>
  <text start="1986.94" dur="4.29">and this is going to come you know with</text>
  <text start="1988.89" dur="5.58">cyber attacks chemical weapons most</text>
  <text start="1991.23" dur="4.56">likely a nuclear type of device and we</text>
  <text start="1994.47" dur="3.51">can see that they&amp;#39;re bringing these</text>
  <text start="1995.79" dur="4.32">people in they know they&amp;#39;re bomb makers</text>
  <text start="1997.98" dur="5.28">they know what&amp;#39;s going on because they</text>
  <text start="2000.11" dur="6.18">are setting up the next event now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2003.26" dur="4.12">very interesting here is the US State</text>
  <text start="2006.29" dur="3.82">Department</text>
  <text start="2007.38" dur="5.94">ordered hundreds of pounds of plastic</text>
  <text start="2010.11" dur="6.51">plastic explosives and thousands of</text>
  <text start="2013.32" dur="6.18">containers of liquid explosives WND has</text>
  <text start="2016.62" dur="5.37">discovered shipping them to location of</text>

  <text start="2021.99" dur="6.96">materials to overseas embassies very</text>
  <text start="2026.18" dur="4.96">interesting that they will be sending</text>
  <text start="2028.95" dur="5.66">this over to embassies around the world</text>
  <text start="2031.14" dur="6.75">and we can see how they can use this to</text>
  <text start="2034.61" dur="6.55">manipulate and create a false flag event</text>
  <text start="2037.89" dur="6.29">with explosions in certain areas near</text>
  <text start="2041.16" dur="6.81">the embassies or inside the embassies</text>

  <text start="2064.08" dur="5.19">igniters the ultimate destination of</text>
  <text start="2066.99" dur="3.81">these products and their cost is unknown</text>
  <text start="2069.27" dur="3.899">at this time but the government</text>

  <text start="2095.129" dur="3.541">they&amp;#39;re completely exempt and they would</text>
  <text start="2097.02" dur="4.59">have no idea that there are explosions</text>

  <text start="2120.27" dur="5.76">blasting caps so we can see from this</text>
  <text start="2123" dur="5.94">that something is going to happen here</text>
  <text start="2126.03" dur="5.37">they are maneuvering they&amp;#39;re ordering</text>
  <text start="2128.94" dur="6.36">explosives and they&amp;#39;re being sent around</text>
  <text start="2131.4" dur="6.24">the world to the embassies why would</text>
  <text start="2135.3" dur="5.33">they be doing this why would they need</text>
  <text start="2137.64" dur="5.63">all of this explosives being</text>
  <text start="2140.63" dur="5.7">maneuvered and transferred to embassies</text>
  <text start="2143.27" dur="5.19">the only reason you would need something</text>
  <text start="2146.33" dur="5.28">like this is to create some type of</text>
  <text start="2148.46" dur="5.49">false flag event to say look this</text>
  <text start="2151.61" dur="5.94">country has attacked our embassy here</text>
  <text start="2153.95" dur="6.18">look Russia attack the embassy in this</text>
  <text start="2157.55" dur="5.61">region and we can see how they&amp;#39;ll pull</text>
  <text start="2160.13" dur="5.73">this whole entire false flag event</text>
  <text start="2163.16" dur="5.1">together now this might be coupled with</text>
  <text start="2165.86" dur="3.42">events that are occurring here in the</text>
  <text start="2168.26" dur="2.73">United States because you have to</text>
  <text start="2169.28" dur="3.99">remember let&amp;#39;s think back to a report</text>
  <text start="2170.99" dur="5.43">that I did quite a while ago where they</text>
  <text start="2173.27" dur="5.82">said that Syria is the launching pad for</text>
  <text start="2176.42" dur="4.8">terrorists and they see a lot of these</text>
  <text start="2179.09" dur="4.05">terrorists moving into Europe we see</text>
  <text start="2181.22" dur="6">terrorists moving into the United States</text>
  <text start="2183.14" dur="6.9">this could be all set up for embassies</text>
  <text start="2187.22" dur="5.61">to explode in certain areas in Europe in</text>
  <text start="2190.04" dur="4.77">the UK and have things happen here in</text>
  <text start="2192.83" dur="5.64">the United States to bring all of these</text>
  <text start="2194.81" dur="5.88">powers into war status to move to</text>
  <text start="2198.47" dur="5.94">maneuver and to move forward with the</text>

  <text start="2204.41" dur="4.02">starting to shape up we see that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2206.81" dur="3.9">starting to connect all the dots right</text>
  <text start="2208.43" dur="4.1">now and we can see we&amp;#39;re moving closer</text>
  <text start="2210.71" dur="4.26">and closer to what they are planning</text>
