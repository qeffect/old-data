  <text start="134.88" dur="7.59">large and Trump and the Patriots right</text>
  <text start="138.48" dur="5.61">now they&amp;#39;re fighting against a central</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="4.32">bank system which is not just here in</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="6.98">the United States it&amp;#39;s in almost every</text>

  <text start="175.05" dur="7.31">system there&amp;#39;s going to be bumps along</text>
  <text start="177.96" dur="7.23">the way and very interestingly Trump</text>
  <text start="182.36" dur="6.85">with one of his tweets and what he said</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="5.19">to reporters he is preparing the</text>
  <text start="189.21" dur="4.31">American people</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="6.12">he&amp;#39;s already laying the groundwork</text>
  <text start="193.52" dur="8.41">preparing the narrative and they already</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="7.98">have a story yes he&amp;#39;s going to blame the</text>
  <text start="201.93" dur="4.98">Federal Reserve yes people will be</text>
  <text start="204.48" dur="4.62">looking at the Federal Reserve but</text>
  <text start="206.91" dur="6">remember a lot of people don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="209.1" dur="6.39">what&amp;#39;s going on a lot of people would be</text>
  <text start="212.91" dur="4.71">completely shocked to know that our</text>
  <text start="215.49" dur="5.19">entire economic system was taken over</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="6.63">bribe private corporation and that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="6.12">not living in a open free market where</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="5.1">the economy is open and free and it</text>
  <text start="226.8" dur="5.97">adjusts to what is going on around the</text>
  <text start="229.35" dur="4.859">world if they learned that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.77" dur="2.91">completely controlled and everything</text>
  <text start="234.209" dur="2.911">that you&amp;#39;re looking at is manipulated</text>
  <text start="235.68" dur="4.68">everything you&amp;#39;re looking at is an</text>
  <text start="237.12" dur="6.66">illusion a lot of people would have a</text>
  <text start="240.36" dur="5.46">breakdown a nervous breakdown and once</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="5.6">they learn that their dollar is worth</text>
  <text start="245.82" dur="7.76">absolutely nothing it would be chaos</text>
  <text start="249.38" dur="9.22">Trump the Patriots they know this and</text>
  <text start="253.58" dur="6.73">the deep state they know this this is</text>
  <text start="258.6" dur="5.4">why they&amp;#39;re pushing the narrative of</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="5.04">recession this is why they want to</text>
  <text start="264" dur="3.419">recession think about what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.35" dur="4.23">trying to do here they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="267.419" dur="6.241">bring the country into a recession to</text>
  <text start="269.58" dur="7.74">get rid of Trump they&amp;#39;re willing to</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="7.62">bring the country into a recession maybe</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="7.08">depression destroy people&amp;#39;s lives to get</text>
  <text start="281.28" dur="8.13">rid of one man</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="8.04">why what are they so afraid of they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="289.41" dur="5.85">afraid of losing their system that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="5.49">what they&amp;#39;re afraid of no it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="295.26" dur="4.49">interesting is that when you look all</text>
  <text start="297.93" dur="5.01">that all the statistical information</text>
  <text start="299.75" dur="4.84">when you look at the GDP numbers when</text>
  <text start="302.94" dur="5.85">you look at the unemployment numbers and</text>
  <text start="304.59" dur="8.609">now we have the US jobless claims they</text>
  <text start="308.79" dur="5.97">unexpectedly dropped all these numbers</text>
  <text start="313.199" dur="3.571">look fantastic</text>
  <text start="314.76" dur="4.1">now initial claims for state</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="5.13">unemployment benefits dropped twelve</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="5.29">thousand to a seasonally adjusted two</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="4.86">hundred nine thousand for the week now</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="5.07">we know these are statistics that can be</text>
  <text start="326.76" dur="3.93">manipulated Trump is using all the tools</text>
  <text start="329.22" dur="3.38">the deep state the central bankers have</text>
  <text start="330.69" dur="4.11">been using for a very long time now</text>
  <text start="332.6" dur="3.31">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="5.07">starting to see out of the mainstream</text>
  <text start="335.91" dur="6.66">media that Trump has no idea on how to</text>
  <text start="339.87" dur="5.1">manage the economy he&amp;#39;s making no sense</text>
  <text start="342.57" dur="5.25">he says tariffs he has these crazy tax</text>
  <text start="344.97" dur="4.23">plans it it all doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="4.77">this is coming out of the wall street</text>
  <text start="349.2" dur="4.95">journal journal a clearly exasperated</text>
  <text start="352.59" dur="3.54">editorial board The Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="354.15" dur="4.62">took Donald Trump to task in a harsh</text>
  <text start="356.13" dur="4.83">column claiming he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to know</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="4.53">what is what he is doing when it comes</text>
  <text start="360.96" dur="3.54">to economics and they&amp;#39;re getting tired</text>
  <text start="363.3" dur="3.96">of his act</text>
  <text start="364.5" dur="6">they said President Trump isn&amp;#39;t famous</text>
  <text start="367.26" dur="5.81">for consistency but his reversal on new</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="5.43">round of tax cuts may be a record on</text>
  <text start="373.07" dur="5.56">Tuesday he said he was considering at a</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="4.41">cut in the payroll tax and index and</text>
  <text start="378.63" dur="3.409">capital gains for inflation but on</text>
  <text start="380.34" dur="5.759">Wednesday he took it all back</text>
  <text start="382.039" dur="6.221">calling Trump&amp;#39;s proposal bizarre mr.</text>
  <text start="386.099" dur="4.611">Trump is also confused about whether the</text>
  <text start="388.26" dur="4.98">economy is strong or weak whether more</text>
  <text start="390.71" dur="4.51">economic stimulus is needed and even</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="4.1">whether his trade brawls with the rest</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="6.419">of the world are weakening the economy</text>
  <text start="397.34" dur="7.27">now think about it do you think Trump</text>
  <text start="401.639" dur="5.581">really doesn&amp;#39;t know what he&amp;#39;s doing with</text>
  <text start="404.61" dur="4.97">the economy he&amp;#39;s a businessman he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="407.22" dur="6.449">in business for a very long time he</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="6.859">understands he understands business he</text>
  <text start="413.669" dur="5.71">understands how the system works</text>
  <text start="416.439" dur="4.8">why do you think he&amp;#39;s out there laying</text>
  <text start="419.379" dur="3.21">this information out there then taking</text>
  <text start="421.239" dur="2.93">it back laying more information out</text>
  <text start="422.589" dur="5.91">there taking it back</text>
  <text start="424.169" dur="10.21">remember he needs to keep this central</text>
  <text start="428.499" dur="10.26">bank economic illusion alive while he</text>
  <text start="434.379" dur="6.6">creates a brand new people&amp;#39;s economy now</text>
  <text start="438.759" dur="4.89">this brand new people&amp;#39;s economy is not</text>
  <text start="440.979" dur="5.43">going to make sense to the mainstream</text>
  <text start="443.649" dur="6.69">media to the deep state to the central</text>
  <text start="446.409" dur="6.63">bank because they don&amp;#39;t want it to</text>
  <text start="450.339" dur="6.51">happen that&amp;#39;s the whole point they see</text>
  <text start="453.039" dur="6.3">the plan wait a minute he&amp;#39;s deviating</text>
  <text start="456.849" dur="5.46">from what we have today people are going</text>
  <text start="459.339" dur="5.73">to recognize that what he&amp;#39;s doing once</text>

  <text start="471.699" dur="5.54">idea what he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s confusing them</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="6.299">on the other hand to keep them off track</text>
  <text start="477.239" dur="5.89">and just like everything else it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.159" dur="5.82">optics he puts it out there see what</text>
  <text start="483.129" dur="5.39">they say brings it back and they moves</text>
