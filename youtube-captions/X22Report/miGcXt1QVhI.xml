  <text start="681.839" dur="6.121">bank system works</text>
  <text start="684.4" dur="5.879">it is done over time very very slowly</text>
  <text start="687.96" dur="4.6">where people don&amp;#39;t realize that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="690.279" dur="5.131">happening where people don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="692.56" dur="5.969">that is happening but this is all part</text>
  <text start="695.41" dur="7.77">of their agenda this is how they&amp;#39;re able</text>
  <text start="698.529" dur="6.661">to control countries and people instead</text>
  <text start="703.18" dur="5.25">of bringing in troops instead of you</text>

  <text start="722.98" dur="4.31">being controlled and they won&amp;#39;t rise up</text>
  <text start="725.35" dur="4.59">until it&amp;#39;s too late</text>
  <text start="727.29" dur="5.62">so as we continually put them into debt</text>
  <text start="729.94" dur="4.35">as we make them poorer and poorer and</text>
  <text start="732.91" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s what the system is about all</text>

  <text start="737.35" dur="5.28">makes the majority of people poor or the</text>
  <text start="740.38" dur="4.08">middle class or those people who are</text>
  <text start="742.63" dur="4.52">just barely making it just barely make</text>

  <text start="747.15" dur="5.5">they barely make enough to pay for the</text>
  <text start="749.83" dur="4.52">debt and they&amp;#39;re on this endless cycle</text>
  <text start="752.65" dur="4.02">where they never can get out of it and</text>

  <text start="760.57" dur="4.86">more and more expensive as time goes on</text>
  <text start="762.4" dur="6.629">and you have to take out more debt just</text>
  <text start="765.43" dur="9.06">to afford something this is how they do</text>
  <text start="769.029" dur="9.361">it and 90% of the country is there the</text>
  <text start="774.49" dur="5.969">other 10% well they&amp;#39;re in the upper</text>
  <text start="778.39" dur="4.74">class and then you have the the high 1%</text>
