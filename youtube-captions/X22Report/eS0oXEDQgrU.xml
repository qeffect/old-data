  <text start="49.08" dur="6.39">collapse financial news now we see today</text>
  <text start="51.69" dur="6.24">after a long thanksgiving weekend the</text>
  <text start="55.47" dur="4.2">markets are not doing it as well as</text>
  <text start="57.93" dur="4.19">everyone thought they were going to do</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="4.44">markets down a little bit today and</text>
  <text start="62.12" dur="3.97">we&amp;#39;re starting to hear a lot of</text>
  <text start="64.11" dur="4.23">information that cyber monday is this</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="4.319">huge success and they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="68.34" dur="4.44">reporting on what happened on friday</text>
  <text start="70.409" dur="5.581">which is black friday they&amp;#39;re staying</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="5.04">kind of quiet about that but we realize</text>
  <text start="75.99" dur="3.3">that no matter what the corporate media</text>
  <text start="77.82" dur="3.839">does you know what the US government</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="4.04">central bankers do they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="3.961">always try to push the meme that</text>
  <text start="83.33" dur="5.44">everything is fine and we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="85.62" dur="5.07">recovery no matter what happens so even</text>
  <text start="88.77" dur="4.02">if the sales are down they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="90.69" dur="4.14">switch it around to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="92.79" dur="5.7">the sales are doing better and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="94.83" dur="6.51">already seeing a lot of this now if</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="6.06">everything was doing well we wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="101.34" dur="5.94">seeing thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="104.55" dur="5.52">people being laid off we wouldn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="7.29">major corporations already planning for</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="7.65">more layoffs in the year 2016 and we see</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="5.76">Morgan Stanley right now they&amp;#39;re reading</text>
  <text start="117.72" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to basically get</text>
  <text start="120.33" dur="4.65">rid of twenty five percent of their</text>
  <text start="122.22" dur="4.62">fixed income jobs within the next two</text>
  <text start="124.98" dur="7.699">weeks they&amp;#39;re going to be laying off</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="5.839">people during the holiday season and</text>
  <text start="133.16" dur="4.659">they&amp;#39;re going to make these cuts</text>
  <text start="134.879" dur="5.311">worldwide and they&amp;#39;re doing it very very</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="5.191">quickly now the question is why revenues</text>
  <text start="140.19" dur="4.92">have dropped in Morgan Stanley just like</text>
  <text start="143.01" dur="5.64">with every other corporations a lot of</text>
  <text start="145.11" dur="5.43">the sales have declined which means less</text>
  <text start="148.65" dur="4.08">revenue into the company which means</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="3.75">they can&amp;#39;t support the number of people</text>
  <text start="152.73" dur="3.899">employed right now but of course the</text>
  <text start="154.29" dur="4.56">CEOs and those top executives are still</text>
  <text start="156.629" dur="4.221">getting the high bonuses but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="5.76">seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="160.85" dur="7.66">laying off people if we go back to June</text>
  <text start="164.61" dur="7.02">of 2014 bring it fast forward up to this</text>
  <text start="168.51" dur="6.54">year what do we see we see almost a</text>
  <text start="171.63" dur="8.46">million layoffs and as we head into 2016</text>
  <text start="175.05" dur="7.86">it is going to get worse and worse now</text>
  <text start="180.09" dur="4.26">they were out there in the corporate</text>
  <text start="182.91" dur="4.71">media and the US government saying that</text>
  <text start="184.35" dur="5.37">black friday was not as bad as last year</text>
  <text start="187.62" dur="5.31">but when we look at this actually it was</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="4.86">worse than last year we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="192.93" dur="4.32">Black Friday and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="194.58" dur="6.66">convince everyone that sales were doing</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="7.32">well well the problem is is that the</text>
  <text start="201.24" dur="6.11">mainstream narrative is completely off</text>
  <text start="204.57" dur="5.16">and they&amp;#39;re flipping everything around</text>
  <text start="207.35" dur="7">ShopperTrak reported that total sales on</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="7.229">Black Friday crashed 10% to 10.4 billion</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="5.49">dollars now if we go back to last year</text>
  <text start="216.959" dur="7.771">last year we had sales of about eleven</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="8.34">point six billion in 2014 this year were</text>
  <text start="224.73" dur="6.6">shy of that so actually sales have</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="4.95">gotten worse so what is the corporate</text>
  <text start="231.33" dur="3.33">media do what is the US government to</text>
  <text start="233.13" dur="3">what are the central bankers do they</text>
  <text start="234.66" dur="2.73">always blame it on something else and of</text>
  <text start="236.13" dur="4.079">course what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="237.39" dur="5.49">saying because of the fuel prices have</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="4.741">dropped so much people in certain areas</text>
  <text start="242.88" dur="4.139">of the country do not have work and this</text>
  <text start="244.95" dur="4.17">is why the sales are not doing as well</text>
  <text start="247.019" dur="4.321">as they thought they&amp;#39;re also saying that</text>
  <text start="249.12" dur="4.2">because stores were open on thursday it</text>
  <text start="251.34" dur="4.05">took away from the Black Friday sales</text>
  <text start="253.32" dur="5.099">and that&amp;#39;s why it is not doing as well</text>
  <text start="255.39" dur="5.159">as they thought now if it was snowing</text>
  <text start="258.419" dur="4.131">they would have blamed it on snow it was</text>
  <text start="260.549" dur="3.781">raining hard it would have been rained</text>
  <text start="262.55" dur="6.13">basically they&amp;#39;re just coming up with</text>
  <text start="264.33" dur="8.67">every excuse a man imaginable to blame</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="8.69">it on something else so to clarify total</text>
  <text start="273" dur="7.53">sales collapsed by 1.2 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="277.37" dur="7.06">even as online sales rose by a hundred</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="8.52">and fifty million so basically what</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="6.42">we&amp;#39;re seeing is people right now don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.05" dur="6.29">have the money to go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="290.85" dur="7.63">the goods and what they did was the</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="5.75">national retail federation</text>
  <text start="298.48" dur="6.87">they changed their method methodology</text>
  <text start="301.09" dur="8.25">this year and they changed it on how</text>
  <text start="305.35" dur="7.05">they calculate the sales and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="5.61">seeing right now is this is how it works</text>
  <text start="312.4" dur="7.19">for pretty much everything if we look at</text>
  <text start="314.95" dur="7.95">inflation GDP unemployment housing sales</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="5.53">retail sales they just continually</text>
  <text start="322.9" dur="5.72">change how they calculate these numbers</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="5.79">to make it fit their narrative and</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="3.82">they&amp;#39;re going to continually do this</text>
  <text start="330.91" dur="6.17">because they need to prove to everyone</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="7.32">that the economy is doing well and</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="4.93">they&amp;#39;ll do this until the very end and</text>
  <text start="339.76" dur="3.84">of course they won&amp;#39;t even take the blame</text>
  <text start="342.01" dur="4.23">at that point they&amp;#39;ll blame it on some</text>
  <text start="343.6" dur="6.24">other country or group now Ford Motor</text>
  <text start="346.24" dur="7.41">Company they are going to be off shoring</text>
  <text start="349.84" dur="7.2">American jobs ford motor company said</text>
  <text start="353.65" dur="6.42">it&amp;#39;s new four-year contract with the UAW</text>
  <text start="357.04" dur="6">will increase its US labor costs by less</text>
  <text start="360.07" dur="5.13">than 1.5 percent annually by letting the</text>
  <text start="363.04" dur="5.54">company hire more low-cost workers and</text>
  <text start="365.2" dur="6.45">move production to factories in other</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="4.93">countries the contract allows forward to</text>
  <text start="371.65" dur="6.08">hire an unlimited number of entry-level</text>
  <text start="373.51" dur="7.74">workers who start at a lower wage and</text>
  <text start="377.73" dur="6.4">basically Ford said it will be able to</text>
  <text start="381.25" dur="6.36">use more temporary workers which are</text>
  <text start="384.13" dur="5.85">also paid less so basically union</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="6.24">workers just agreed to a contract which</text>
  <text start="389.98" dur="5.37">creates or keeps some jobs and basically</text>
  <text start="393.85" dur="3.57">takes all the jobs and moves them</text>
  <text start="395.35" dur="6.06">outside the country and allows people to</text>
  <text start="397.42" dur="8.01">work part-time and entry-level work so</text>
  <text start="401.41" dur="11.04">they can pay them less manufacturing in</text>
  <text start="405.43" dur="10.65">this country is slowly disappearing they</text>
  <text start="412.45" dur="5.34">are moving it out of the country and we</text>
  <text start="416.08" dur="4.02">have proof of this because when we look</text>
  <text start="417.79" dur="4.83">at the manufacturing statistics when we</text>
  <text start="420.1" dur="5.58">look at the Baltic Dry Index we can see</text>
  <text start="422.62" dur="5.94">that manufacturing is non existence and</text>
  <text start="425.68" dur="6.569">we can see from the graph that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="428.56" dur="7.159">shown many many times 1.4 million my</text>
  <text start="432.249" dur="7.14">facturing jobs lost 1.5 million</text>
  <text start="435.719" dur="7.48">service-oriented jobs gained that tells</text>
  <text start="439.389" dur="6.99">the whole story right there and we see</text>
  <text start="443.199" dur="7.71">right now that we are headed towards a</text>
  <text start="446.379" dur="6.39">complete collapse of the system more and</text>
  <text start="450.909" dur="4.38">more indicators are coming out the</text>
  <text start="452.769" dur="4.38">dallas fed manufacturing that printed</text>
  <text start="455.289" dur="4.05">down negative four point nine percent</text>
  <text start="457.149" dur="6.84">this is the eleventh month that it is</text>
  <text start="459.339" dur="7.89">contracted this hasn&amp;#39;t been seen outside</text>
  <text start="463.989" dur="5.33">of a recession actually all of these</text>
  <text start="467.229" dur="6.48">numbers that are coming in right now are</text>
  <text start="469.319" dur="8.35">worse than a recession we&amp;#39;re beyond that</text>
  <text start="473.709" dur="7.29">at this point new orders contracted once</text>
  <text start="477.669" dur="6.39">again the entire system completely</text>
  <text start="480.999" dur="5.55">falling apart now when we look at</text>
  <text start="484.059" dur="4.65">housing we understand that case-shiller</text>
  <text start="486.549" dur="3.72">is telling us prices are going up the</text>
  <text start="488.709" dur="3.15">national association of realtors is</text>
  <text start="490.269" dur="3.9">telling us that prices have been coming</text>
  <text start="491.859" dur="4.23">down in the last four months I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="494.169" dur="3.66">looking around and I reported on this</text>
  <text start="496.089" dur="4.08">many many months ago where I already saw</text>
  <text start="497.829" dur="4.26">the stall speed where the housing prices</text>
  <text start="500.169" dur="4.5">stalled they already started coming down</text>
  <text start="502.089" dur="4.41">houses are on the market longer and</text>
  <text start="504.669" dur="4.95">longer mortgage applications are</text>
  <text start="506.499" dur="6.45">declining and it&amp;#39;s getting worse and</text>
  <text start="509.619" dur="6.001">worse as time goes on and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.949" dur="5.31">seeing right now is that the National</text>
  <text start="515.62" dur="5.399">Association of realtor is saying okay</text>
  <text start="518.259" dur="4.95">yes we do have a problem in the housing</text>
  <text start="521.019" dur="3.651">market right now and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523.209" dur="5.281">blaming this on many different things</text>
  <text start="524.67" dur="5.649">their first area where they&amp;#39;re switching</text>
  <text start="528.49" dur="4.74">it up they&amp;#39;re saying that the low oil</text>
  <text start="530.319" dur="4.981">prices are the problem because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="533.23" dur="3.839">having all these job losses in the</text>
  <text start="535.3" dur="3.36">sector but which was very funny is that</text>
  <text start="537.069" dur="4.02">the US government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="538.66" dur="3.929">not even reporting on those jobs that</text>
  <text start="541.089" dur="3.24">are lost but the national association of</text>
  <text start="542.589" dur="3.511">realtors are saying because of all these</text>
  <text start="544.329" dur="5.19">job losses were having the problem in</text>
  <text start="546.1" dur="5.07">sales so which is right I mean because</text>
  <text start="549.519" dur="5.07">the US government didn&amp;#39;t report on the</text>
  <text start="551.17" dur="6.63">hundred plus thousand jobs that were let</text>
  <text start="554.589" dur="4.68">go because of the oil prices but the</text>
  <text start="557.8" dur="4.289">national association of realtors is</text>
  <text start="559.269" dur="5.521">reporting on it so right now pending</text>
  <text start="562.089" dur="3.871">home sales basically have fallen once</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="3.33">again</text>
  <text start="565.96" dur="4.41">they missed expectations they were</text>
  <text start="568.12" dur="5.04">expecting it to be a lot better it is</text>
  <text start="570.37" dur="4.83">declined once again and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="573.16" dur="4.34">seeing this quite often now starting</text>
  <text start="575.2" dur="5.1">back June of 2014 where we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="577.5" dur="7.48">pending home sales continually falling</text>
  <text start="580.3" dur="6.93">and declining and getting worse and what</text>
  <text start="584.98" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this story of</text>
  <text start="587.23" dur="4.23">how the economy is doing and what to</text>
  <text start="589.3" dur="3.63">blame it on it&amp;#39;s getting all mixed up</text>
  <text start="591.46" dur="3.63">and confused and whatever is out there</text>
  <text start="592.93" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re going to use at this</text>
  <text start="595.09" dur="3.81">point we saw this happen back in two</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="4.29">thousand eight where the story was all</text>
  <text start="598.9" dur="5.09">mixed up they tell us everything was</text>
  <text start="600.76" dur="5.43">contained sustained everything is fine</text>
  <text start="603.99" dur="4.54">but when the people were getting laid</text>
  <text start="606.19" dur="6.21">off when housing sales was completely</text>
  <text start="608.53" dur="7.2">taking a dive they never admitted it to</text>
  <text start="612.4" dur="5.01">it until the very very end and of course</text>
  <text start="615.73" dur="4.23">then they blamed it on those people who</text>
  <text start="617.41" dur="3.87">took out mortgages who where they</text>
  <text start="619.96" dur="2.76">weren&amp;#39;t really qualified to take out</text>
  <text start="621.28" dur="3.27">those mortgages and we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="622.72" dur="4.38">same thing right now but again who gives</text>
  <text start="624.55" dur="4.23">them the mortgages who tells them it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="627.1" dur="5.7">good idea to go and put zero percent</text>
  <text start="628.78" dur="5.88">down who lowers the qualifications of</text>
  <text start="632.8" dur="3.78">getting a mortgage well it&amp;#39;s the US</text>
  <text start="634.66" dur="4.23">government central bankers and the whole</text>
  <text start="636.58" dur="3.99">banking community where they say okay</text>
  <text start="638.89" dur="3.75">you have no credit you&amp;#39;re not earning</text>
  <text start="640.57" dur="4.98">any money no problem you&amp;#39;re approved for</text>
  <text start="642.64" dur="5.49">a housing mortgage go buy a house</text>
  <text start="645.55" dur="4.38">actually to make it even better take out</text>
  <text start="648.13" dur="3.45">adjustable rate mortgage this way you</text>
  <text start="649.93" dur="3.63">get the low interest rates and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="651.58" dur="3.48">worry if the interest rates go up you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="653.56" dur="4.08">be you&amp;#39;ll be able to lock in whenever</text>
  <text start="655.06" dur="4.05">you want and they try this back in two</text>
  <text start="657.64" dur="2.81">thousand eight and the whole thing was a</text>
  <text start="659.11" dur="5.01">complete disaster as interest rates</text>
  <text start="660.45" dur="5.32">continually rose we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="664.12" dur="3.24">thing happen right now this is why</text>
  <text start="665.77" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re keeping interest rates very low</text>
  <text start="667.36" dur="8.31">this is why interest rates are not going</text>
  <text start="669.94" dur="7.08">to be adjusted in an upward way this is</text>
  <text start="675.67" dur="4.29">why they&amp;#39;re going to actually go</text>
  <text start="677.02" dur="5.22">negative not positive we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="679.96" dur="4.8">Chinese buyers now they have left the US</text>

  <text start="728.499" dur="8.19">economy as we know is getting weaker and</text>
  <text start="732.1" dur="6.359">weaker by the day in many aspects were</text>

  <text start="738.459" dur="6.12">we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more corporations</text>
  <text start="740.62" dur="6.36">layoffs now there&amp;#39;s added pressure right</text>
  <text start="744.579" dur="4.95">now which the US has tried to stop many</text>
  <text start="746.98" dur="3.57">many times before where they were</text>
  <text start="749.529" dur="3.78">supposed to give up their voting rights</text>
  <text start="750.55" dur="4.5">in the IMF allow the emerging markets</text>
  <text start="753.309" dur="5.34">the emerging countries to have more of</text>
  <text start="755.05" dur="5.55">the voting rights back in 2010 but the</text>
  <text start="758.649" dur="3.24">US government kept those voting rights</text>
  <text start="760.6" dur="4.01">because they knew the outcome of that</text>
  <text start="761.889" dur="5.82">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="764.61" dur="5.529">the IMF looked at the yuan rememba today</text>
  <text start="767.709" dur="4.891">and they gave it the green light they</text>
  <text start="770.139" dur="6">approved it saying yes it can be</text>
  <text start="772.6" dur="6.75">included in the SDR basket on october</text>
  <text start="776.139" dur="6.3">first 2016 so basically this gives the</text>
  <text start="779.35" dur="7.229">US government from now until october of</text>
  <text start="782.439" dur="6.721">2016 to do what they have to do to blame</text>
  <text start="786.579" dur="7.141">this entire collapse of the system on</text>
  <text start="789.16" dur="6.719">another country and another group the</text>
  <text start="793.72" dur="6.719">IMF says the you wanna meets freely</text>

  <text start="800.439" dur="5.101">expected to help facilitate use of the</text>
  <text start="802.48" dur="6.99">SDR lagarde adding you one recognizes</text>
  <text start="805.54" dur="6.12">China&amp;#39;s progress on reforms and we can</text>
  <text start="809.47" dur="5.539">see already they&amp;#39;re making their move to</text>
  <text start="811.66" dur="6.419">make the you won a reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="815.009" dur="5.411">as the one becomes a reserve currency it</text>
  <text start="818.079" dur="5.13">may increase downward pressure on the</text>
  <text start="820.42" dur="4.169">dollar a lot of countries will start</text>
  <text start="823.209" dur="3.781">removing the dollar from its reserve</text>
  <text start="824.589" dur="3.781">currency adding the yuan Russia has</text>
  <text start="826.99" dur="4.529">already said this is what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="828.37" dur="3.99">to start to do and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="831.519" dur="4.081">they might</text>
  <text start="832.36" dur="7.74">twenty percent of the yuan and make it</text>
  <text start="835.6" dur="7.83">their international currency reserve so</text>
  <text start="840.1" dur="6.84">we can see at this point there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="843.43" dur="8.67">of pressure right now the u.s. system</text>
  <text start="846.94" dur="7.68">the dollar system is collapsing the IMF</text>
  <text start="852.1" dur="4.47">has approved the Chinese you one as a</text>
  <text start="854.62" dur="5.79">reserve currency and I remember</text>
  <text start="856.57" dur="9.48">reporting on this a year and a half ago</text>
  <text start="860.41" dur="7.83">and here we are today and we can see</text>
  <text start="866.05" dur="4.529">that it&amp;#39;s a matter of time before this</text>
  <text start="868.24" dur="5.01">entire system starts really falling</text>
  <text start="870.579" dur="4.711">apart it has already started countries</text>
  <text start="873.25" dur="3.69">have already been making bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="875.29" dur="4.32">agreements with China now I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="876.94" dur="4.26">this is the answer to our prayers that</text>
  <text start="879.61" dur="3.81">this is going to help everything</text>
  <text start="881.2" dur="4.59">actually all we&amp;#39;re doing is moving</text>
  <text start="883.42" dur="4.83">everything from one location which is</text>
  <text start="885.79" dur="5.52">the west to the east what we really need</text>
  <text start="888.25" dur="7.8">to do is get rid of the central banking</text>
  <text start="891.31" dur="7.86">community and let the government and the</text>
  <text start="896.05" dur="7.86">people take care of creating their</text>
  <text start="899.17" dur="6.93">currency with no interest attached so</text>
  <text start="903.91" dur="5.28">right now the central bank of central</text>
  <text start="906.1" dur="5.19">bank&amp;#39;s they know the dollar is dying</text>
  <text start="909.19" dur="6.019">they&amp;#39;re making their move to move</text>
  <text start="911.29" dur="7.2">everything from the west to the east and</text>
  <text start="915.209" dur="5.651">of course the central bank&amp;#39;s who are</text>
  <text start="918.49" dur="4.89">controlling the dollar they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="920.86" dur="5.28">to lose power they want the dollar to</text>
  <text start="923.38" dur="5.1">continue on forever no matter how much</text>
  <text start="926.14" dur="7.17">debt there is in the world but as we</text>
  <text start="928.48" dur="6.419">know this system reaches the point where</text>
  <text start="933.31" dur="4.56">it can&amp;#39;t go any further and it just</text>
  <text start="934.899" dur="6.93">fizzles and dies out and the central</text>
  <text start="937.87" dur="6.57">banking system the top tier the</text>
  <text start="941.829" dur="3.991">Rothschilds they don&amp;#39;t want this to just</text>
  <text start="944.44" dur="2.49">fizzle out because everyone&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="945.82" dur="3.29">look at the central bank saying okay</text>
  <text start="946.93" dur="4.98">these systems only last for 40 45 years</text>
  <text start="949.11" dur="5.11">we can&amp;#39;t have this we can&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="951.91" dur="6.72">central bank we need a system that lasts</text>
  <text start="954.22" dur="8.46">forever and helps each level of a</text>
  <text start="958.63" dur="7.56">society and this is why they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="962.68" dur="6.06">divert your attention from them sell</text>
  <text start="966.19" dur="4.92">over to another group or a country and</text>
  <text start="968.74" dur="6.27">blame this entire collapse on someone</text>
  <text start="971.11" dur="5.94">else and this is why as we approach 2016</text>
  <text start="975.01" dur="4.56">everyone needs to really think about</text>
  <text start="977.05" dur="7.56">where they are what they&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
