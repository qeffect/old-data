  <text start="114.78" dur="6.96">2020 now the reason they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="6.77">is because the economy well whoever</text>

  <text start="157.14" dur="7.5">believe that we are entering a recession</text>
  <text start="161.03" dur="5.29">now statistically we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="164.64" dur="4.11">has the magic one and he&amp;#39;s making the</text>
  <text start="166.32" dur="6.51">economy look great he&amp;#39;s using all their</text>

  <text start="184.11" dur="2.58">unemployment look at GDP everything</text>
  <text start="185.76" dur="3.12">looks fantastic</text>
  <text start="186.69" dur="3.6">meanwhile people losing jobs left and</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="3.24">right the housing market is declining</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="4.56">and everyone&amp;#39;s trying to figure out what</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="5.66">is going on here Trump is doing the same</text>
  <text start="194.85" dur="7.23">thing he&amp;#39;s using every single piece of</text>
  <text start="197.78" dur="6.67">weaponry that they used against them now</text>
  <text start="202.08" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re trying to turn it all around now</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it seem like we</text>
  <text start="206.16" dur="4.35">are already in a recession even though</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="3.779">the government doesn&amp;#39;t report it now</text>
  <text start="210.51" dur="4.47">this is part of their plan this is part</text>
  <text start="212.459" dur="4.681">of their narrative and they&amp;#39;re even</text>
  <text start="214.98" dur="4.229">saying that even if the Fed cuts rates</text>
  <text start="217.14" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s not gonna make a difference we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.209" dur="3.691">gonna be in a recession no matter what</text>
  <text start="220.62" dur="6.3">and we don&amp;#39;t even think the Fed is going</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="5.82">to cut rates this is their plan this is</text>
  <text start="226.92" dur="4.56">all they have left they have nothing</text>
  <text start="228.72" dur="5.19">else left to use what do you think is</text>
  <text start="231.48" dur="5.13">going to happen you think the feds gonna</text>
  <text start="233.91" dur="5.639">cut rate absolutely do you think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="4.47">gonna start stimulus absolutely does</text>
  <text start="239.549" dur="3.781">this mean it&amp;#39;s gonna happen this</text>
  <text start="241.08" dur="3.93">Wednesday maybe maybe not</text>
  <text start="243.33" dur="4.68">I think time is running out I think</text>
  <text start="245.01" dur="5.24">sooner the better I think Trump will</text>
  <text start="248.01" dur="4.949">need this time to build the economy up</text>
  <text start="250.25" dur="5.19">but again they know better it will</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="6.421">happen we don&amp;#39;t know the exact timing</text>
  <text start="255.44" dur="6.519">but it will happen why because it has to</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="4.71">because when we look at the central bank</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="3.541">economy and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="3.06">for a very long time this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="265.5" dur="2.07">do with tariffs has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="6.51">anything</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="8.909">the central bank system is imploding on</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="7.17">itself because this is how it is</text>
  <text start="276.479" dur="7.741">designed when we look at homes when we</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="7.13">look at retail when we look at the real</text>
  <text start="284.22" dur="6.6">unemployment numbers when we look at the</text>
  <text start="287.96" dur="5.889">Cass freight index the durable goods</text>
  <text start="290.82" dur="5.909">offers manufacturing when we start to</text>
  <text start="293.849" dur="4.531">look at all these indicators we know</text>
  <text start="296.729" dur="5.071">that it&amp;#39;s been slowing for a very long</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="5.25">time if we look at us home builders</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="5.34">sentiment well</text>
  <text start="303.63" dur="5.58">that&amp;#39;s beginning to drop already and we</text>
  <text start="307.14" dur="5.37">normally don&amp;#39;t see this during the</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="5.01">spring summer months usually the home</text>
  <text start="312.51" dur="3.36">builders are very happy when the warm</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="4.94">weather comes because they can sell</text>
  <text start="315.87" dur="6.18">homes but for the first time in 2019</text>
  <text start="319.16" dur="7.03">sentiment among us home builders dropped</text>
  <text start="322.05" dur="7.86">in June even though there are lower</text>
  <text start="326.19" dur="6.42">mortgage rates well I think we need to</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="4.77">bring a little bit lower remember what</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="4.58">we talked about in the past lower the</text>
  <text start="334.68" dur="5.94">rate brings more people into the market</text>
  <text start="337.19" dur="6.94">Trump knows this Trump understands that</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="7.47">he needs to cut rates quickly or</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="5.73">everything will completely implode and I</text>
  <text start="348.09" dur="6.09">do believe he has the magic wand I do</text>
  <text start="349.86" dur="7.35">believe this is already planned out we</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="5.94">have Morgan Stanley out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.21" dur="5.97">saying that the world is already in a</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="9.74">recession yes it has been for a very</text>
  <text start="363.18" dur="10.76">long time the central bank system is</text>
  <text start="369.86" dur="6.31">dying off this is what it looks like</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="4.47">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if there was tariffs or</text>
  <text start="376.17" dur="5.43">there were no tariffs it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="378.41" dur="7.51">what anyone was doing the central bank</text>
  <text start="381.6" dur="7.41">system would implode on itself that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.92" dur="5.55">just the way it&amp;#39;s designed but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="389.01" dur="4.29">trying to make it seem like this has to</text>
  <text start="391.47" dur="5.61">do with Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs now what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="5.88">to happen is gee when Trump most likely</text>
  <text start="397.08" dur="4.8">will meet at the g20 meeting we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="6.96">already getting signs of that and they</text>
  <text start="401.88" dur="7.47">will hammer out a deal and tariffs will</text>
  <text start="406.14" dur="5.97">be removed the entire argument of the</text>
  <text start="409.35" dur="5.09">central bank of the deep state it will</text>
  <text start="412.11" dur="5.25">the whole thing will go down the toilet</text>
  <text start="414.44" dur="5.35">they won&amp;#39;t have anything to hide behind</text>
  <text start="417.36" dur="6.36">anymore which means they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="419.79" dur="7.23">exposed and when we look at what is</text>
  <text start="423.72" dur="5.28">happening here we already know that the</text>
  <text start="427.02" dur="5.13">central bank system is really in a</text>
  <text start="429" dur="5.34">recession we already know</text>
  <text start="432.15" dur="5.28">that they&amp;#39;ve been kicking the can down</text>
  <text start="434.34" dur="6.57">the street for a very long time we</text>
  <text start="437.43" dur="6.83">already know that Trump needs to kick</text>
  <text start="440.91" dur="5.759">the can down past the 2020 election and</text>
  <text start="444.26" dur="7.42">when you look at some of the headlines</text>
  <text start="446.669" dur="7.31">from CNBC MSNBC CNN you can see how</text>
  <text start="451.68" dur="7.739">they&amp;#39;re trying to control this entire</text>
  <text start="453.979" dur="9.271">narrative CNBC if a recession hits even</text>

  <text start="476.58" dur="5.46">recession I mean it&amp;#39;s quite obvious what</text>
  <text start="480.419" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re trying to do here they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="482.04" dur="5.64">to create this narrative that what Trump</text>
  <text start="485.19" dur="5.37">has done is bringing us right into a</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="5.19">recession the problem is all these</text>
  <text start="490.56" dur="7.19">articles are going to be wrong as soon</text>
  <text start="492.87" dur="8.43">as the Fed cuts rates as soon as the Fed</text>
  <text start="497.75" dur="6.639">initiates stimulus which will happen at</text>
  <text start="501.3" dur="7.31">the latter part of this year everything</text>
  <text start="504.389" dur="8.33">will turn around we&amp;#39;ve seen it before</text>
  <text start="508.61" dur="9.19">let&amp;#39;s go back to the recession of</text>
  <text start="512.719" dur="8.081">2008-2009 the Fed went ahead and raised</text>
  <text start="517.8" dur="4.83">rates they raised them they raised them</text>
  <text start="520.8" dur="4.74">they raised them and then when it hit a</text>
  <text start="522.63" dur="6.48">critical point and it started the</text>
  <text start="525.54" dur="6.06">implosion of the entire system they</text>
  <text start="529.11" dur="5.669">started to drop rates and this was</text>
  <text start="531.6" dur="5.609">around 2006-2007 and they dropped him</text>
  <text start="534.779" dur="6.841">very quickly and the recession happened</text>
  <text start="537.209" dur="7.801">in 2008-2009 if you go back to 2000 2001</text>
  <text start="541.62" dur="5.94">they raise the interest rates when it</text>
  <text start="545.01" dur="5.01">hit that critical mass they dropped the</text>
  <text start="547.56" dur="5.16">interest rates very very quickly if you</text>
  <text start="550.02" dur="6.66">go back to the other recessions it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="552.72" dur="6.51">same exact thing I do believe that Trump</text>
  <text start="556.68" dur="5.63">stopped it before they hit the critical</text>
  <text start="559.23" dur="5.19">mass because if it hit the critical mass</text>
  <text start="562.31" dur="2.84">everything would just implode and</text>
  <text start="564.42" dur="3.25">there&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="565.15" dur="5.46">nothing to stop it and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="5.88">Trump put a pause to this right before</text>
  <text start="570.61" dur="5.43">it hit that critical mass and now he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="573.55" dur="5.52">be able to lower the rates using the Fed</text>
  <text start="576.04" dur="7.83">and starting stimulus once again to pump</text>
  <text start="579.07" dur="7.4">the system up this has to be done if it</text>
  <text start="583.87" dur="6.93">isn&amp;#39;t done and the economy actually</text>
  <text start="586.47" dur="6.55">heads into a recession well guess what</text>
  <text start="590.8" dur="4.89">Trump would be in trouble they know this</text>
  <text start="593.02" dur="5.9">the Patriots know this this is why they</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="8.43">put a pause to the Fed raising rates</text>
  <text start="598.92" dur="8.56">during 2019 because they knew if the Fed</text>
  <text start="604.12" dur="6.12">continued this through 2019 the system</text>
  <text start="607.48" dur="4.46">would implode now something very</text>
  <text start="610.24" dur="5.46">interesting</text>
  <text start="611.94" dur="7.33">xi Jinping he will be visiting North</text>
  <text start="615.7" dur="7.02">Korea for two days and this is the first</text>
  <text start="619.27" dur="7.35">time a Chinese Lee&amp;#39;s leader visited</text>

  <text start="626.62" dur="6.03">Jinping has control of kim jeong-hoon</text>
  <text start="629.91" dur="7.54">we know that Kim jong-un has a very good</text>
  <text start="632.65" dur="9.66">relationship with Trump I do believe G</text>
  <text start="637.45" dur="9.45">is boxed in right now and G most likely</text>
  <text start="642.31" dur="8.52">will be trying to save face somehow by</text>
  <text start="646.9" dur="7.23">going to Kim jong-eun working something</text>
  <text start="650.83" dur="7.53">out and then meeting Trump at the g20</text>
  <text start="654.13" dur="6.69">meeting and once they do meet I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="658.36" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re going to hash something out now</text>
  <text start="660.82" dur="5.82">will it will be announced at the g20</text>
  <text start="663.64" dur="5.16">that there is a deal maybe maybe not but</text>
  <text start="666.64" dur="5.55">I do believe a short period of time</text>
  <text start="668.8" dur="5.88">after the g20 if it&amp;#39;s not announced in</text>
  <text start="672.19" dur="4.73">the g20 they will announce that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="674.68" dur="5.82">made a deal remember</text>
  <text start="676.92" dur="5.32">Trump boxed in China right now I do</text>
  <text start="680.5" dur="3.9">believe they have a framework already</text>
  <text start="682.24" dur="5.46">worked out and I do believe this is</text>
  <text start="684.4" dur="4.83">being done on purpose to go after the</text>
  <text start="687.7" dur="4.68">central bank system because I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="6.29">think one country can take down the</text>
  <text start="692.38" dur="5.4">entire central bank apparatus I believe</text>
  <text start="695.52" dur="3.31">Trump the Patriots are going to need</text>
  <text start="697.78" dur="3.869">help from China</text>
  <text start="698.83" dur="6.569">from Russia and many other countries to</text>

  <text start="707.649" dur="5.661">watching the deep sate the central bank</text>
  <text start="709.45" dur="7.53">their last-ditch effort to try to</text>
  <text start="713.31" dur="5.709">control the narrative going into the</text>
