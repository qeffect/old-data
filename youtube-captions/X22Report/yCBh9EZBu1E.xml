  <text start="48.5" dur="7.559">up-and-down situation and it&amp;#39;s like a</text>

  <text start="56.059" dur="5.341">report com site a picture and it shows</text>
  <text start="58.729" dur="4.71">the train of the roller coaster going up</text>

  <text start="63.439" dur="3.751">the top and you know what happens on a</text>
  <text start="65.57" dur="6.48">roller coaster when you get to the top</text>
  <text start="67.19" dur="7.83">it&amp;#39;s a fast ride down and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="72.05" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re going to see now yesterday I meant</text>
  <text start="75.02" dur="6.03">to read this quote and I&amp;#39;m going to read</text>
  <text start="77.9" dur="5.34">it now this is from Mark Twain and he</text>
  <text start="81.05" dur="5.46">describes a patriot which I thought was</text>
  <text start="83.24" dur="7.2">an excellent quote in the beginning of a</text>
  <text start="86.51" dur="7.74">change the Patriot is a scarce man and</text>
  <text start="90.44" dur="7.14">brave and hated and scorned when his</text>
  <text start="94.25" dur="6.39">cause succeeds the timid join him for</text>
  <text start="97.58" dur="8.63">then it costs nothing to be a patriot</text>
  <text start="100.64" dur="9.54">and this holds true completely I mean</text>
  <text start="106.21" dur="7.03">today those constitutional groups those</text>
  <text start="110.18" dur="8.16">Patriots were standing up for the rights</text>
  <text start="113.24" dur="9.15">of the people right now excuse me right</text>
  <text start="118.34" dur="7.38">now they are you know looking at them</text>
  <text start="122.39" dur="6.899">and they&amp;#39;re being demonized as domestic</text>
  <text start="125.72" dur="6.69">terrorists constitutionalist and right</text>
  <text start="129.289" dur="6.631">now they are hated they are scorned but</text>
  <text start="132.41" dur="4.61">guess what when people start to realize</text>
  <text start="135.92" dur="2.72">that these people are</text>
  <text start="137.02" dur="5.46">right and our rights have been taken</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="7.44">away the tide will turn and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="142.48" dur="7.65">start siding with the Patriots because</text>
  <text start="146.08" dur="6.36">if you really look right now at I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="150.13" dur="5.61">going to use America right now and you</text>
  <text start="152.44" dur="5.01">look at our Constitution and we have the</text>
  <text start="155.74" dur="4.2">Bill of Rights of you know the First</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="5.54">Amendment Second Amendment and you look</text>
  <text start="159.94" dur="7.26">what the government has done and what</text>
  <text start="162.99" dur="7.15">laws they&amp;#39;ve passed to erode the</text>
  <text start="167.2" dur="5.73">Constitution and even some cases try to</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="7.35">get rid of it I mean you&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="172.93" dur="7.71">the NDAA the Patriot Act the Miranda</text>
  <text start="177.49" dur="5.64">exception rule the ability for the</text>
  <text start="180.64" dur="6.6">military to put boots on the ground to</text>
  <text start="183.13" dur="8.82">have this separate police force a</text>
  <text start="187.24" dur="7.59">federal police force DHS and and they</text>
  <text start="191.95" dur="5.7">have the authority to go into each state</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="5.18">and work with local and for local law</text>
  <text start="197.65" dur="6.51">enforcement or even take them over and</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="8.11">if you look at all this everything is</text>
  <text start="204.16" dur="7.44">being slowly eroded away and before you</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="7.71">know it the Constitution will be gone</text>
  <text start="211.6" dur="9">and what happens is they do this so</text>
  <text start="215.83" dur="7.08">slowly and so stealthy that nobody can</text>
  <text start="220.6" dur="7.44">see this happening and they keep all of</text>
  <text start="222.91" dur="8.73">this quiet until they need it until the</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="6.93">government needs to enact the Miranda</text>
  <text start="231.64" dur="5.25">exception rule or the NDAA saying this</text>
  <text start="234.97" dur="4.53">group of people are domestic terrorists</text>
  <text start="236.89" dur="5.25">you do not get a trial you do not get a</text>
  <text start="239.5" dur="4.79">lawyer you are thrown into prison we</text>
  <text start="242.14" dur="6.3">will deal with you in one year from now</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="7.62">so this is what happens everything stays</text>
  <text start="248.44" dur="7.769">dormant just like the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="7">until it&amp;#39;s needed until they need these</text>
  <text start="256.209" dur="7.971">things they put in place nobody really</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="8.28">knows about it now right now the</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="5.44">Japanese financial system is beginning</text>
  <text start="267.19" dur="3.57">to spin completely out of control I know</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="5.64">the market went up</text>
  <text start="270.76" dur="6.84">day but you know they are trying to hold</text>
  <text start="275.26" dur="4.29">this thing together and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="277.6" dur="4.26">see further ups and downs and I said</text>
  <text start="279.55" dur="5.34">yesterday that you know everyone is</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="6.78">expecting this huge collapse all at once</text>
  <text start="284.89" dur="8.58">and i believe that again i&amp;#39;m saying this</text>
  <text start="288.64" dur="7.35">again but the Fed government&amp;#39;s central</text>
  <text start="293.47" dur="5.85">banks are going to try to do this in</text>
  <text start="295.99" dur="6.87">stages and this way as they do this</text>
  <text start="299.32" dur="6.09">incrementally people won&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="4.58">going on they won&amp;#39;t have time to react</text>
  <text start="305.41" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;ll think it&amp;#39;s still okay and</text>
  <text start="307.44" dur="6.4">they&amp;#39;re going to continue to pump the</text>
  <text start="310.42" dur="6.3">markets up because the best way to have</text>
  <text start="313.84" dur="7.62">a collapse is to keep everyone in the</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="7.29">dark everyone asleep why they do their</text>
  <text start="321.46" dur="5.37">things behind the scenes for instance</text>
  <text start="324.01" dur="5.79">keep the gold and silver prices down and</text>
  <text start="326.83" dur="5.52">keep pushing them down so nobody becomes</text>
  <text start="329.8" dur="4.92">none the wiser of what&amp;#39;s happening push</text>
  <text start="332.35" dur="5.16">the stock market up so no one knows</text>
  <text start="334.72" dur="5.52">what&amp;#39;s really going on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="337.51" dur="5.01">and even if we do have a you know i</text>
  <text start="340.24" dur="7.83">should say when when we do have a mini</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="9.02">crash of the stock market again they</text>
  <text start="348.07" dur="6.93">will stop it try to push it back up and</text>
  <text start="351.54" dur="7.24">again people will think everything is</text>
  <text start="355" dur="6.3">okay and go back to sleep and boom as it</text>
  <text start="358.78" dur="4.83">keeps continually happening they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="361.3" dur="5.13">know that something&amp;#39;s wrong until the</text>
  <text start="363.61" dur="4.56">very end and they won&amp;#39;t know to get into</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="4.5">gold and silver because by then it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="368.17" dur="4.83">too late and they won&amp;#39;t know to prep</text>
  <text start="370.93" dur="4.11">they won&amp;#39;t know to store things they</text>
  <text start="373" dur="4.47">they won&amp;#39;t know to have water they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="5.4">know it have medical supplies everyone</text>
  <text start="377.47" dur="10.11">will be completely asleep they&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="380.44" dur="11.55">no idea what is going on now like I said</text>
  <text start="387.58" dur="7.65">in my other episodes the things that we</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="7.38">need to look for as the economic</text>
  <text start="395.23" dur="6.75">collapse moves forward is we need to</text>
  <text start="399.37" dur="5.19">look for things like I said quickly</text>
  <text start="401.98" dur="5.82">creating laws to remove rights</text>
  <text start="404.56" dur="5.43">more taxes more troops on the ground now</text>
  <text start="407.8" dur="5.16">there have been more reports of people</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="6.63">seeing planes flying in that are</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="6.75">unmarked troops around the country and</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="7.1">if anyone has seen this or heard of this</text>
  <text start="419.71" dur="7.1">I read about it on other sites and</text>
  <text start="423.72" dur="5.77">people are reporting in seeing this</text>
  <text start="426.81" dur="4.72">we&amp;#39;re seeing more military exercises</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="6.86">within our borders the Pentagon just</text>
  <text start="431.53" dur="4.82">recently said that the military force</text>
  <text start="436.44" dur="4.78">does not need the permission of the</text>
  <text start="438.7" dur="5.969">Pentagon of the President or the</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="5.79">governors of each state and we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="444.669" dur="5.581">seen more we&amp;#39;ve seen full slides but now</text>
  <text start="447.01" dur="6.51">you know more of the force false flags</text>
  <text start="450.25" dur="6.3">to push the laws that are pending in the</text>
  <text start="453.52" dur="7.16">Senate and we haven&amp;#39;t seen balance and</text>
  <text start="456.55" dur="8.1">we have not seen war yet but more taxes</text>
  <text start="460.68" dur="9.79">we are seeing I mean we&amp;#39;re looking at a</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="7.86">tax on on flying Obama administration</text>
  <text start="470.47" dur="5.009">has proposed raising the taxes on air</text>
  <text start="472.51" dur="6.029">travel by about fourteen dollars per</text>
  <text start="475.479" dur="4.681">flight a move airline strongly opposed</text>
  <text start="478.539" dur="3.661">and of course they do because this will</text>
  <text start="480.16" dur="4.08">cut into their business but you see how</text>
  <text start="482.2" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re starting to do more and more</text>
  <text start="484.24" dur="6.989">taxes as you see more of this come on</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="5.73">the the things that I&amp;#39;ve listed here it</text>
  <text start="491.229" dur="5.131">means we&amp;#39;re getting closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="493.36" dur="5.16">the collapse and you know especially</text>
  <text start="496.36" dur="4.35">even Obamacare that was a huge one</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="5.73">either you take the health insurance or</text>
  <text start="500.71" dur="6.99">you&amp;#39;re taxed I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a no-win</text>
  <text start="504.25" dur="5.55">situation and of course they just want</text>
  <text start="507.7" dur="5.07">the tax money because they know most of</text>
  <text start="509.8" dur="7.4">the people won&amp;#39;t be able to afford this</text>
  <text start="512.77" dur="8.699">health insurance now interestingly</text>
  <text start="517.2" dur="7.329">enough McCain snuck into Syria to meet</text>
  <text start="521.469" dur="6.151">with the rebels now basically the rebels</text>
  <text start="524.529" dur="6.271">are the hired mercenary of the CIA of</text>
  <text start="527.62" dur="6">the United States and those are the ones</text>
  <text start="530.8" dur="6.78">fighting in Syria trying to overthrow</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="4.53">Assad and it&amp;#39;s amazing how he goes over</text>
  <text start="537.58" dur="5.79">there and</text>
  <text start="538.15" dur="7.38">and you know and talk to the the the</text>
  <text start="543.37" dur="4.38">rebels there and they you know they spin</text>
  <text start="545.53" dur="3.99">this as he&amp;#39;s trying to create peace no</text>
  <text start="547.75" dur="3.54">he&amp;#39;s not they&amp;#39;re not trying to do</text>
  <text start="549.52" dur="5.04">anything that has to do with peace just</text>
  <text start="551.29" dur="7.98">like the EU arms embargo which is being</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="7.53">lifted and this will allow heavier more</text>
  <text start="559.27" dur="6.12">advanced weapons to be shipped into the</text>
  <text start="562.09" dur="5.37">Syrian rebels and this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="5.28">with peace this has to do with the</text>
  <text start="567.46" dur="5.73">rebels are losing Assad harmonies are</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="4.95">winning and they needed to do something</text>
  <text start="573.19" dur="4.71">so they tell you that oh we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="575.62" dur="5.37">list the lift the embargo because of</text>
  <text start="577.9" dur="5.76">this will help with peace with the peace</text>
  <text start="580.99" dur="4.74">movement and but has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="583.66" dur="7.14">that it has to do with now we can ship</text>
  <text start="585.73" dur="7.65">in more arms really arm the rebels with</text>
  <text start="590.8" dur="6.39">more advanced heavier weaponry so they</text>
  <text start="593.38" dur="7.2">can push forward with this war effort</text>
  <text start="597.19" dur="6.12">that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re doing now Israel came</text>
  <text start="600.58" dur="13.14">out and said that you know they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="603.31" dur="12.99">to shoot down a Russian ships if they</text>
  <text start="613.72" dur="4.68">are bringing advanced missiles to Syria</text>
  <text start="616.3" dur="4.62">now to me I believe this is all</text>
  <text start="618.4" dur="5.88">propaganda I mean come on if Israel</text>
  <text start="620.92" dur="5.31">actually shoots down one of the ships</text>
  <text start="624.28" dur="6.57">what do you think Russia is going to do</text>
  <text start="626.23" dur="7.28">and at this point to start the war they</text>
  <text start="630.85" dur="7.32">don&amp;#39;t want the people to know that</text>
  <text start="633.51" dur="7.72">Israel or the United States started the</text>
  <text start="638.17" dur="7.71">war that will not help their cause</text>
  <text start="641.23" dur="8.99">because um the Americans will definitely</text>
  <text start="645.88" dur="6.57">not be into fighting at this point</text>
  <text start="650.22" dur="6.94">basically what they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="652.45" dur="9.03">do is switch it around where they have</text>
  <text start="657.16" dur="8.25">to say either Russia Syria Iran or China</text>
  <text start="661.48" dur="5.85">made the first move or North Korea any</text>
  <text start="665.41" dur="4.89">of those countries it has to look like</text>
  <text start="667.33" dur="4.26">they made the first move and we are</text>
  <text start="670.3" dur="3.45">defending arson</text>
  <text start="671.59" dur="7.26">against the even though it was provoked</text>
  <text start="673.75" dur="9.24">and pushed and we push them to the limit</text>
  <text start="678.85" dur="7.02">of they can&amp;#39;t take it anymore and this</text>
  <text start="682.99" dur="4.11">is the only way they can bring war and I</text>
  <text start="685.87" dur="3.56">don&amp;#39;t even think that will be enough</text>
  <text start="687.1" dur="6.54">because I don&amp;#39;t think the Americans are</text>
  <text start="689.43" dur="9.21">really that into going to war and the</text>
  <text start="693.64" dur="9.33">only way to get people angry enough to</text>
  <text start="698.64" dur="7.72">push for a war is there needs to be some</text>
  <text start="702.97" dur="8.43">type of false flag here in America and</text>
  <text start="706.36" dur="8.34">until they do that i do not see anything</text>
  <text start="711.4" dur="5.4">happening with the war effort I mean</text>
  <text start="714.7" dur="5.88">everything they tried with the chemical</text>
  <text start="716.8" dur="7.14">weapons and and you know the the rights</text>
  <text start="720.58" dur="5.43">of the people all that is you know they</text>
  <text start="723.94" dur="4.92">have weapons of mass destruction all</text>
  <text start="726.01" dur="10.56">that stuff they&amp;#39;re trying is not working</text>
  <text start="728.86" dur="11.16">at all so let&amp;#39;s move on here so this</text>
  <text start="736.57" dur="6.15">Senator Dick Durbin says constitution is</text>
  <text start="740.02" dur="6.27">out of date because he&amp;#39;s saying that we</text>
  <text start="742.72" dur="5.67">have to look at and I have the video on</text>
  <text start="746.29" dur="4.14">this page if you want to take a look at</text>
  <text start="748.39" dur="3.36">it he&amp;#39;s saying that we have to take</text>
  <text start="750.43" dur="6.05">another look at the First Amendment</text>
  <text start="751.75" dur="4.73">because there&amp;#39;s this amendment really</text>
  <text start="756.84" dur="6.37">pertain to bloggers and and activist</text>
  <text start="761.62" dur="5.49">because we know who the real reporters</text>
  <text start="763.21" dur="6.6">are you know AP news or ABC News or CNN</text>
  <text start="767.11" dur="5.31">but bloggers and stuff really don&amp;#39;t fall</text>
  <text start="769.81" dur="5.04">into this now has he read the First</text>
  <text start="772.42" dur="5.94">Amendment because I think he&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="774.85" dur="5.22">confused I&amp;#39;ll read it Congress shall</text>
  <text start="778.36" dur="4.71">make no law respecting an establishment</text>
  <text start="780.07" dur="5.97">of religion or prohibiting the free</text>
  <text start="783.07" dur="6.78">exercise thereof or abridging the</text>
  <text start="786.04" dur="6.72">freedom of speech or of the press or the</text>
  <text start="789.85" dur="4.86">right of the people peaceably to</text>
  <text start="792.76" dur="6.42">assemble and to petition the government</text>
  <text start="794.71" dur="8.03">for a redress of grievances it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1195.98" dur="8.1">know going back like 70 episodes or so</text>
  <text start="1199.429" dur="7.671">so this is kind of scary and even Obama</text>
  <text start="1204.08" dur="7.46">now is trying to you</text>
  <text start="1207.1" dur="8.92">tell everyone that the Internet is a</text>

  <text start="1216.02" dur="5.97">can see that this is completely</text>
  <text start="1218.12" dur="7.4">spreading and they&amp;#39;re pushing this out</text>

  <text start="1235.88" dur="5.49">know that what does he use the internet</text>
  <text start="1237.65" dur="5.94">for but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s getting to the</text>
  <text start="1241.37" dur="6">point where you know we need to start</text>
  <text start="1243.59" dur="8.07">banding together and you know start</text>
  <text start="1247.37" dur="7.17">talking to other people about what this</text>
  <text start="1251.66" dur="6.84">cut was happening to not just America</text>
  <text start="1254.54" dur="6.09">but to every country now I thought this</text>
  <text start="1258.5" dur="8.82">was very interesting that and this could</text>
  <text start="1260.63" dur="11.36">be a potential false flag DHS can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1267.32" dur="8.22">locate 266 illegal overstays that pose</text>
  <text start="1271.99" dur="7.66">national security risks now I said this</text>
  <text start="1275.54" dur="5.49">in the past DHS is not here to find</text>
  <text start="1279.65" dur="3.8">terrorists because if you go to their</text>
  <text start="1281.03" dur="4.71">terrorist alert system it&amp;#39;s always blank</text>
  <text start="1283.45" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re here to spy on the American</text>
  <text start="1285.74" dur="5.76">people to control the American before</text>
  <text start="1287.59" dur="5.74">during and after the collapse now the</text>

  <text start="1293.33" dur="7.32">find 266 potential dangerous immigrants</text>
  <text start="1297.26" dur="7.08">who have overstayed their visas how</text>
  <text start="1300.65" dur="8.279">convenient you know they basically they</text>
  <text start="1304.34" dur="6.719">went on to say they have 1901 cases or</text>
  <text start="1308.929" dur="3.661">reprioritize for further investigation</text>
  <text start="1311.059" dur="4.681">by DHS because the subjects of the</text>

  <text start="1319.429" dur="7.201">post security threats 266 for some odd</text>
  <text start="1323.39" dur="6.72">reason cannot be located and these are</text>
  <text start="1326.63" dur="8.85">dangerous people that you know you know</text>
  <text start="1330.11" dur="8.7">that that could potentially be 10</text>
  <text start="1335.48" dur="6.62">person and do terrorist type of Acts it</text>
  <text start="1338.81" dur="6.69">within the country now I know on the</text>
  <text start="1342.1" dur="7.33">sidebar of the x 22 report com site I</text>
  <text start="1345.5" dur="6.39">put that they lost two people that were</text>
  <text start="1349.43" dur="4.86">in the witness protection plan so we can</text>
  <text start="1351.89" dur="5.15">add those to this and that we have 268</text>
  <text start="1354.29" dur="4.92">dome a terrorist not domestic but</text>
  <text start="1357.04" dur="7.03">terrorists running around the country I</text>
  <text start="1359.21" dur="9.41">mean is this not a setup or what okay</text>
  <text start="1364.07" dur="7.92">let&amp;#39;s move on here now the US Congress</text>
  <text start="1368.62" dur="6.04">wants to legalize cyber attacks to fight</text>
  <text start="1371.99" dur="5.16">cyber crimes now the only reason they</text>
  <text start="1374.66" dur="6.27">are pushing to legalize these cyber</text>
  <text start="1377.15" dur="7.32">attacks is so they can cyber attack Iran</text>
  <text start="1380.93" dur="6.66">Syria basically it&amp;#39;s to provoke them and</text>
  <text start="1384.47" dur="5.85">push them into a war that is the only</text>
  <text start="1387.59" dur="5.04">reason they want to legalize this</text>
  <text start="1390.32" dur="6.42">because you have to remember way back</text>
  <text start="1392.63" dur="8.18">they said if somebody a country cyber</text>
  <text start="1396.74" dur="11.87">attacked us here in America that is</text>
  <text start="1400.81" dur="11.83">considered war and if a cyber attack I</text>
  <text start="1408.61" dur="5.86">Janet Napolitano and other government</text>
  <text start="1412.64" dur="5.99">officials said if they cyber attack our</text>
  <text start="1414.47" dur="8.85">infrastructure it is like a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1418.63" dur="9.67">weapon being used on America and that</text>
  <text start="1423.32" dur="8.76">constitutes war so the only reason they</text>
  <text start="1428.3" dur="6.51">want to do this is to basically provoke</text>
  <text start="1432.08" dur="6.57">the other countries cyber attack them</text>
  <text start="1434.81" dur="7.86">and provoke them into making a move to</text>
  <text start="1438.65" dur="8.31">start the war to cover up you got it the</text>
  <text start="1442.67" dur="10.8">economic collapse now we did have a</text>
  <text start="1446.96" dur="8.73">report that the u.s. weapon system</text>

  <text start="1459.23" dur="2.91">they what they&amp;#39;re saying here is</text>

  <text start="1587.93" dur="9">they&amp;#39;re going to have many false flags</text>
  <text start="1590.95" dur="9.95">because they do have the gun bill UN</text>
  <text start="1596.93" dur="6.85">arms treaty sista pending in</text>

  <text start="1633.33" dur="5.28">mean there can&amp;#39;t be anything else okay</text>
  <text start="1635.87" dur="6.07">that might be a backup thing we might</text>
  <text start="1638.61" dur="4.64">see something before that sistah we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1641.94" dur="4.8">definitely going to have some type of</text>
  <text start="1643.25" dur="7.39">mini cyber attack to try to get that</text>
  <text start="1646.74" dur="6.06">bill passed and when I say mini cyber</text>
  <text start="1650.64" dur="5.73">attack I mean there might be some funds</text>
  <text start="1652.8" dur="7.02">in a bank that kind of disappear maybe</text>
  <text start="1656.37" dur="7.53">enough to get people really scared or we</text>
  <text start="1659.82" dur="7.62">might have a glitch in the power systems</text>
  <text start="1663.9" dur="6.87">and maybe a couple of states bill lose</text>
  <text start="1667.44" dur="8.12">power or you know they might go all out</text>
  <text start="1670.77" dur="8.97">because time is of the essence with them</text>
  <text start="1675.56" dur="6.64">there things have not been going exactly</text>
  <text start="1679.74" dur="4.38">how they had planned i do believe they</text>
  <text start="1682.2" dur="5.37">they really thought they would have the</text>
  <text start="1684.12" dur="5.7">gun bill already passed and ready I</text>
  <text start="1687.57" dur="4.26">really think that and the UN arms treaty</text>
  <text start="1689.82" dur="3.87">was going to just follow that I think</text>
  <text start="1691.83" dur="3.21">that they thought they had that in the</text>
  <text start="1693.69" dur="3.41">bag with Sandy Hook and they thought</text>
  <text start="1695.04" dur="4.95">this was going to be a done deal I</text>
  <text start="1697.1" dur="5.38">believe they thought that the war in</text>
  <text start="1699.99" dur="6.45">Syria and Iran would be really ramping</text>
  <text start="1702.48" dur="7.86">up now and and we would be heading</text>
  <text start="1706.44" dur="6.36">towards world war three and I and I</text>
  <text start="1710.34" dur="4.23">believe they thought sista was going to</text>
  <text start="1712.8" dur="6.54">be passed with no problems and I think</text>
  <text start="1714.57" dur="7.35">all this is is putting them a little off</text>
  <text start="1719.34" dur="5.79">schedule because the Fed is doing</text>
  <text start="1721.92" dur="5.76">everything they can to continually pump</text>
  <text start="1725.13" dur="5.4">and pump and pump China is teetering</text>
  <text start="1727.68" dur="3.99">right now and they&amp;#39;re trying to you know</text>
  <text start="1730.53" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re taking up the scotch tape</text>
  <text start="1731.67" dur="3.02">putting it all over and everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1733.95" dur="2.63">going up and</text>
  <text start="1734.69" dur="4.8">up and down and they&amp;#39;re just trying to</text>
  <text start="1736.58" dur="5.82">hold the entire system together they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1739.49" dur="5.94">done their test of the balance they</text>
  <text start="1742.4" dur="5.28">created the document and for the FDIC</text>
  <text start="1745.43" dur="4.79">Bank of England document they done their</text>
  <text start="1747.68" dur="5.22">tests in Cyprus they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="1750.22" dur="5.17">other laws in Canada and Europe</text>

  <text start="1758.08" dur="4.78">that have to do with balance so</text>
  <text start="1760.82" dur="5.13">everything is kind of prepared with that</text>
  <text start="1762.86" dur="5.88">and they are just getting ready they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1765.95" dur="4.44">going to be spreading this around and I</text>
  <text start="1768.74" dur="3.59">think they thought they would have a lot</text>
  <text start="1770.39" dur="6.02">more done than they have right now and</text>
  <text start="1772.33" dur="7.39">they need to get these things completed</text>
  <text start="1776.41" dur="5.32">sooner than later so I believe things</text>
  <text start="1779.72" dur="5.16">are going to be put into overdrive and</text>
  <text start="1781.73" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re going to see quite a lot happen in</text>
