  <text start="677.24" dur="5.74">mean they&amp;#39;re starting to unload their</text>
  <text start="679.559" dur="6.361">Treasuries and maybe one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="682.98" dur="5.669">that china is devaluing is to use this</text>
  <text start="685.92" dur="4.56">as a cover for its desire to unload as</text>

  <text start="848.88" dur="6.17">we will see inflation here because we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="851.7" dur="5.67">have too many dollars in circulation and</text>

  <text start="871.95" dur="7.79">government central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="873.9" dur="8.73">pushing the blame over to China because</text>
  <text start="879.74" dur="6.04">we&amp;#39;ve said this many times that the</text>
  <text start="882.63" dur="6.27">central bank does not want to be blamed</text>
  <text start="885.78" dur="6.15">for what is about to happen and that is</text>
  <text start="888.9" dur="6.33">a complete collapse of the system and we</text>
  <text start="891.93" dur="5.49">see since 2014 central banks around the</text>
  <text start="895.23" dur="7.64">world in different countries have been</text>
  <text start="897.42" dur="7.95">asking for their gold back so far from</text>
  <text start="902.87" dur="4.57">the Fed there&amp;#39;s about two hundred and</text>
  <text start="905.37" dur="6.57">forty six tons of gold that were</text>
  <text start="907.44" dur="7.83">withdrawn from the Fed because each</text>
  <text start="911.94" dur="5.55">country realizes they need to hold their</text>
  <text start="915.27" dur="5.76">gold physically they just can&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="917.49" dur="6.06">claim check and we see first it was</text>
  <text start="921.03" dur="4.59">Germany who redeemed 120 tons of</text>
  <text start="923.55" dur="5.66">physical gold in 2014 then it was the</text>

  <text start="934.5" dur="6.6">redeposit it in Vienna Switzerland and</text>
  <text start="936.89" dur="7.18">we can see these nations are saying okay</text>
  <text start="941.1" dur="6.84">we need to hold our gold we understand</text>
  <text start="944.07" dur="7.34">what is coming and those countries that</text>
  <text start="947.94" dur="6.06">have gold they will be kind of okay</text>
  <text start="951.41" dur="5.5">China has been purchasing tons of gold</text>

  <text start="960.959" dur="6.271">central bankers right now are going to</text>
  <text start="964.59" dur="6.09">use excuses of why they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="967.23" dur="5.07">responsible for what is coming and here</text>
  <text start="970.68" dur="4.35">is an excuse from one of the central</text>
  <text start="972.3" dur="6.42">bankers where they say we are merely</text>
  <text start="975.03" dur="8.16">reacting to a situation we did not</text>
  <text start="978.72" dur="7.11">create it&amp;#39;s almost like Ben Bernanke</text>
  <text start="983.19" dur="6.33">coming out in 2008 saying that we are</text>
  <text start="985.83" dur="6.18">not forecasting a recession anytime soon</text>
  <text start="989.52" dur="4.53">and he said this in the year of 2008</text>
  <text start="992.01" dur="4.2">when we had a recession when the market</text>
  <text start="994.05" dur="3.45">crashed in October and we can see</text>
  <text start="996.21" dur="6.15">already the central bankers are out</text>
  <text start="997.5" dur="6.54">there using excuses and basically taking</text>
  <text start="1002.36" dur="5.34">the blame off themselves and putting it</text>
  <text start="1004.04" dur="6.9">elsewhere and this global collapse is</text>
