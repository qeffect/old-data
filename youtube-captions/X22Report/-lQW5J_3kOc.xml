  <text start="38.55" dur="5.939">olgas 8 2016 and the top of the episode</text>
  <text start="41.64" dur="4.5">is us on the verge of complete failure</text>
  <text start="44.489" dur="5.341">in the Middle East a petro dollar is</text>
  <text start="46.14" dur="6.15">doomed let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="49.83" dur="4.979">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="52.29" dur="4.53">now many people in the United States</text>
  <text start="54.809" dur="6.061">they they still believe the United</text>
  <text start="56.82" dur="6.03">States is a capitalist country but we</text>
  <text start="60.87" dur="3.93">moved away from being a capitalist</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="5.4">country we moved into a fascist country</text>
  <text start="64.8" dur="6.63">yes just like Italy during the time of</text>
  <text start="68.25" dur="6.03">World War two with miss Mussolini this</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="6">is when government and corporations and</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="5.1">banks intertwined and a government takes</text>
  <text start="77.43" dur="7.469">orders from the corporations and the</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="7.95">central banks and back in 2013 we saw</text>
  <text start="84.899" dur="4.951">that attorney General Eric Holder and</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="8.82">Obama created initiative called</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="9.66">Operation choke point and this was to be</text>
  <text start="96.15" dur="5.31">used to investigate banks in the United</text>
  <text start="99.51" dur="4.289">States and the business they do with</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="4.68">payment processors payday lenders and</text>
  <text start="103.799" dur="3.811">other companies believed to be at a</text>
  <text start="106.14" dur="4.17">higher risk for fraud and money</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="4.41">laundering but like anything else and</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="3.809">everything else that the government</text>
  <text start="112.02" dur="5.51">creates like the Patriot Act which you</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="6.36">know was supposed to protect the US</text>
  <text start="117.53" dur="4.629">citizen but actually it was used to spy</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="3.39">on the US citizen the Affordable Care</text>
  <text start="122.159" dur="4.35">Act which was supposed to give the</text>
  <text start="123.869" dur="3.901">everyday person inexpensive health</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="4.26">insurance and said it gave them</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="4.529">expensive health insurance and if we go</text>
  <text start="130.769" dur="4.461">through all these different legislations</text>
  <text start="132.299" dur="5.25">the meaning is always the opposite and</text>
  <text start="135.23" dur="5.41">when we look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="137.549" dur="5.731">operation choke point was really to go</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="5.43">after the competition of certain</text>
  <text start="143.28" dur="7.31">businesses and shut them down it was</text>
  <text start="146.07" dur="9.75">used to go after maybe different</text>
  <text start="150.59" dur="7.03">firearms uh stores and shut them down</text>
  <text start="155.82" dur="4.05">where people wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to use</text>
  <text start="157.62" dur="4.19">their credit cards to purchase a weapon</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="7.4">and</text>
  <text start="161.81" dur="9.3">this was used as a weapon to go after</text>
  <text start="167.27" dur="7.86">certain corporations competition certain</text>
  <text start="171.11" dur="10.04">banks competition to completely shut</text>
  <text start="175.13" dur="11.37">them down and by having this type of</text>
  <text start="181.15" dur="8.26">weapon the government has the ability to</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="6.72">go around and say listen you can&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="189.41" dur="5.46">payment you can&amp;#39;t take payment and what</text>
  <text start="193.22" dur="2.97">happens to these companies is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="7.05">completely shut down they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="196.19" dur="8.43">business and they were using this all</text>
  <text start="201.92" dur="5.099">over the country and a lot of business</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re taking down so there would be no</text>
  <text start="207.019" dur="4.891">competition for those corporations that</text>
  <text start="209.75" dur="7.59">are backing the US government</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="10.34">politicians so what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="9.72">our country is now overtaken by</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="8.459">corporations by central banks the US</text>
  <text start="227.06" dur="6.29">government our government employees</text>
  <text start="230.709" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re not working for the people</text>
  <text start="233.35" dur="5.38">they&amp;#39;re not supporting the people</text>
  <text start="235.579" dur="6.901">they&amp;#39;re not creating these bills for the</text>
  <text start="238.73" dur="8.72">people everything is being done for a</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="7.71">corporation for a central bank and</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="6.9">nothing is being done for the people and</text>
  <text start="250.19" dur="8.07">when we look back in time it is</text>
  <text start="254.35" dur="8.319">completely obvious that everything that</text>
  <text start="258.26" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;ve been doing has never been in the</text>
  <text start="262.669" dur="4.231">best interest of the people of the</text>
  <text start="264.41" dur="4.29">United States I mean for example we can</text>
  <text start="266.9" dur="5.73">just look at the Affordable Care Act</text>
  <text start="268.7" dur="6.36">which is Obamacare where when they told</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="4.259">us that this was going to help the</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="3.9">people everyone was going to get</text>
  <text start="276.889" dur="5.991">insurance it was going to be affordable</text>
  <text start="278.96" dur="6.959">well as soon as soon as it was passed</text>
  <text start="282.88" dur="4.93">Congress decided we&amp;#39;re going to exempt</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="5.671">ourselves we&amp;#39;re going to even exempt the</text>
  <text start="287.81" dur="6.44">staffers because it&amp;#39;s too expensive the</text>
  <text start="291.59" dur="3.75">insurance is not as good but you people</text>
  <text start="294.25" dur="3.24">you</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="5.28">can take it it&amp;#39;ll be good for you and</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="5.709">what do we see today we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="300.62" dur="4.14">affordable premiums we see premiums that</text>
  <text start="303.199" dur="4.161">are going up by forty fifty sixty</text>
  <text start="304.76" dur="10.8">percent and the insurance policies are</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="10.96">absolutely awful now out in Nigeria and</text>
  <text start="315.56" dur="6.18">Somalia we see the United Kingdom</text>
  <text start="318.32" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re sending 60 military personnel to</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="5.1">garrison those countries now of course</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re going down there to fight</text>
  <text start="326.84" dur="4.86">terrorism they&amp;#39;re helping the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.27" dur="8.04">out but we have to remember these</text>
  <text start="331.7" dur="8.64">countries this is where the oil is China</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="5.359">is in these countries they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="340.34" dur="6.53">infrastructure deals with these</text>
  <text start="342.669" dur="8.261">governments the UK the United States</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="8.26">wherever Russia or China are this is</text>
  <text start="350.93" dur="6.06">where the UK France the United States</text>
  <text start="355.13" dur="4.38">the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="356.99" dur="5.34">countries that&amp;#39;s where they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="359.51" dur="5.129">go now of course Russia China they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.33" dur="4.86">not bringing troops into these areas but</text>
  <text start="364.639" dur="5.041">the other countries are because what</text>
  <text start="367.19" dur="7.159">happens is they bring in the terrorists</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="8.34">they bring in Boko Haram Islamic state</text>
  <text start="374.349" dur="5.38">al-shabab or any of the others and say</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="5.1">listen we will help you out and get rid</text>
  <text start="379.729" dur="5.851">of this problem that you have and what</text>
  <text start="383.12" dur="5.19">they end up doing is the end of garrison</text>
  <text start="385.58" dur="4.08">the country and they stay there they</text>
  <text start="388.31" dur="7.5">never leave and then they bring in more</text>
  <text start="389.66" dur="10.74">troops we see out in south korea south</text>
  <text start="395.81" dur="7.079">korea right now is telling china to stop</text>
  <text start="400.4" dur="5.91">North Korea they&amp;#39;re trying to put China</text>
  <text start="402.889" dur="6">in the middle of this because China came</text>
  <text start="406.31" dur="5.28">out and said listen we see that you put</text>
  <text start="408.889" dur="5.071">the Thad missile defense system in your</text>
  <text start="411.59" dur="4.38">country and this is because of North</text>
  <text start="413.96" dur="7.579">Korea but the missiles are pointing</text>
  <text start="415.97" dur="8.52">towards China so South Korea of course</text>
  <text start="421.539" dur="5.891">with the United States behind south</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="4.59">korea because remember South Korea is a</text>
  <text start="427.43" dur="5.79">puppet at the United States is can</text>
  <text start="429.08" dur="6.78">trolling them they are telling China to</text>
  <text start="433.22" dur="6.03">tell North Korea to stop what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="435.86" dur="6.54">doing now they&amp;#39;re trying to make China</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="4.949">you know in the center of all of this</text>
  <text start="442.4" dur="4.56">because eventually what they want to do</text>
  <text start="444.199" dur="6.69">is they want to have some type of</text>
  <text start="446.96" dur="7.169">provocation occur in this area and they</text>
  <text start="450.889" dur="5.221">need China in the mix and this is why</text>
  <text start="454.129" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re doing it and we know when we go</text>
  <text start="456.11" dur="3.69">back in time and we look at what North</text>
  <text start="458.479" dur="4.201">Korea has done where they had this</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="5.76">earthquake in North Korea we know Russia</text>
  <text start="462.68" dur="7.28">Japan and China have reported there was</text>
  <text start="465.56" dur="7.319">absolutely no radiation from that</text>
  <text start="469.96" dur="6.37">explode the alleged explosion or the</text>
  <text start="472.879" dur="5.34">earthquake that occurred no radiation</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="3.869">they couldn&amp;#39;t detect anything that</text>
  <text start="478.219" dur="3.271">happened there but of course the United</text>
  <text start="480.199" dur="3.421">States came out and said it was a</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="4.049">nuclear underground nuclear test that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.62" dur="3.449">why there was an earthquake and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="485.539" dur="4.081">starting to realize right now that it</text>
  <text start="487.069" dur="6.361">was just an earthquake but they used it</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="6.84">to get the Thad anti-missile system in</text>
  <text start="493.43" dur="5.19">place they&amp;#39;re using it to bring in the</text>
  <text start="496.46" dur="5.22">Patriot missile system they&amp;#39;re using it</text>
  <text start="498.62" dur="7.079">to increase the military budget this is</text>
  <text start="501.68" dur="6.959">how this all works they create</text>
  <text start="505.699" dur="6.03">propaganda and they show no proof</text>
  <text start="508.639" dur="4.71">whatsoever and then they increase the</text>
  <text start="511.729" dur="3.06">military budget they bring in the</text>
  <text start="513.349" dur="4.17">military assets they bring in the troops</text>
  <text start="514.789" dur="5.401">and we&amp;#39;re continually seen this</text>
  <text start="517.519" dur="4.83">throughout the world and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="520.19" dur="4.019">the build-up and Eastern Europe we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="522.349" dur="3.151">seeing the buildup in Africa we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.209" dur="3.44">seeing the buildup in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="525.5" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re seeing the buildup in the Pacific</text>
  <text start="527.649" dur="7.361">why because they&amp;#39;re getting ready for</text>
  <text start="530.54" dur="6.15">war now in Afghanistan we know that we</text>
  <text start="535.01" dur="5.37">were never leaving that area the United</text>
  <text start="536.69" dur="5.67">States NATO it&amp;#39;s a strategic location we</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="3.84">have a gas pipeline that&amp;#39;s running</text>
  <text start="542.36" dur="3.78">through Afghanistan there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="544.22" dur="5.85">lithium there&amp;#39;s a lot of copper China</text>
  <text start="546.14" dur="6.11">and Russia are in Afghanistan and of</text>
  <text start="550.07" dur="6.66">course as we know the United States</text>
  <text start="552.25" dur="6.97">controls the poppy fields and we can see</text>
  <text start="556.73" dur="4.53">that the US and NATO they&amp;#39;re planning on</text>
  <text start="559.22" dur="3.69">bringing in more military as its and</text>
  <text start="561.26" dur="3.03">more troops into this area</text>
  <text start="562.91" dur="4.56">because we&amp;#39;re getting word that the</text>
  <text start="564.29" dur="5.85">Islamic state which maybe there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="567.47" dur="5.34">handful of these individuals or maybe</text>
  <text start="570.14" dur="4.77">even none in this country they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="572.81" dur="3.99">to be joining up with the Taliban now of</text>
  <text start="574.91" dur="5.16">course this is a propaganda coming out</text>
  <text start="576.8" dur="5.28">from the United States because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="580.07" dur="5.55">going to use this to say we need to</text>
  <text start="582.08" dur="6.93">bring in more forces into this area and</text>
  <text start="585.62" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re already seeing that whatever the</text>
  <text start="589.01" dur="3.93">president told us before where the</text>
  <text start="590.48" dur="4.32">troops were coming home well that was a</text>
  <text start="592.94" dur="4.11">line once again because the only reason</text>
  <text start="594.8" dur="4.59">he told us that was because during the</text>
  <text start="597.05" dur="5.34">time President Karzai would not sign the</text>
  <text start="599.39" dur="4.95">bilateral security agreement which would</text>
  <text start="602.39" dur="4.5">give immunity to the soldiers so he only</text>
  <text start="604.34" dur="5.97">had one choice at that time to bring all</text>
  <text start="606.89" dur="5.58">the troops home once his term was over</text>
  <text start="610.31" dur="3.75">in December and John Kerry went into</text>
  <text start="612.47" dur="4.29">Afghanistan to help out with the</text>
  <text start="614.06" dur="5.79">elections they got the candidate they</text>
  <text start="616.76" dur="5.4">wanted immediately after he was elected</text>
  <text start="619.85" dur="4.74">he signed that agreement and then all of</text>
  <text start="622.16" dur="4.5">a sudden the troops stopped coming home</text>
  <text start="624.59" dur="4.65">and now we can see they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="626.66" dur="5.25">this propaganda to bring more troops</text>
  <text start="629.24" dur="5.67">into this area we see things are heating</text>
  <text start="631.91" dur="6.21">up around this entire area they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.91" dur="6.42">preparing for war that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="638.12" dur="5.16">happening here we see more indicators</text>
  <text start="641.33" dur="5.75">that turkey is moving closer and closer</text>
  <text start="643.28" dur="6.75">to Russia Turkey says they are ready to</text>
  <text start="647.08" dur="7.78">start the Turkish stream project once</text>
  <text start="650.03" dur="7.68">again so the coup that the United States</text>
  <text start="654.86" dur="5.67">was trying to push on Turkey did not</text>
  <text start="657.71" dur="6.92">work turkey is now moving closer and</text>
  <text start="660.53" dur="7.17">closer to Iran to Russia to China and</text>
  <text start="664.63" dur="5.59">the entire Middle East situation is</text>
  <text start="667.7" dur="6">getting worse and worse actually Russia</text>
  <text start="670.22" dur="7.74">and Turkey they might even be working</text>
  <text start="673.7" dur="6.33">together to control what is happening in</text>
  <text start="677.96" dur="3.93">the Middle East at this point we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="680.03" dur="5.1">to see how this turns out because Earl</text>
  <text start="681.89" dur="5.61">one is going to meet Putin on August</text>

  <text start="725.62" dur="4.44">a situation where the u.s. they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="728.02" dur="5.24">to have no choice but to do something</text>
  <text start="730.06" dur="7.26">now they have two options they have one</text>
  <text start="733.26" dur="7.84">have some type of an event create an</text>
  <text start="737.32" dur="6.33">instance or some type of scenario where</text>
  <text start="741.1" dur="4.56">they can say ah it was Russia who did</text>
  <text start="743.65" dur="3.87">this it was Syria who did this and we</text>
  <text start="745.66" dur="4.08">need to bring the full United States</text>
  <text start="747.52" dur="5.88">forces into this area or the full</text>
  <text start="749.74" dur="6.66">coalition forces into this area or they</text>
  <text start="753.4" dur="7.53">can just back away actually there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="756.4" dur="8.97">third option we can see the think tank</text>
  <text start="760.93" dur="7.44">the Brookings Institution we know in the</text>
  <text start="765.37" dur="6.33">past they came up with a paper which</text>
  <text start="768.37" dur="6.87">talked about no-fly zones safe havens</text>
  <text start="771.7" dur="8.42">whatever you want to call it and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="775.24" dur="9.87">come up with a new version of it and</text>
  <text start="780.12" dur="8.23">this new version which is version 2 of</text>
  <text start="785.11" dur="6.06">the safe haven plan now if we look at</text>
  <text start="788.35" dur="4.65">this plan what they&amp;#39;re saying is that</text>
  <text start="791.17" dur="5.28">the United States in cooperation with</text>
  <text start="793" dur="6.06">its allies accelerates and intensifies</text>
  <text start="796.45" dur="6.87">its involvement on the ground in those</text>
  <text start="799.06" dur="7.44">areas safe havens can essentially emerge</text>
  <text start="803.32" dur="5.82">an important advantage of this approach</text>
  <text start="806.5" dur="5.91">is that it doesn&amp;#39;t require putting</text>
  <text start="809.14" dur="5.78">American credibility on the line but</text>
  <text start="812.41" dur="7.35">does help local allies build up and</text>
  <text start="814.92" dur="6.76">reinforces success on the ground so</text>
  <text start="819.76" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re making friends with the Kurds</text>
  <text start="821.68" dur="8.04">which is part of this plan they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="824.02" dur="7.71">hoping to create humanitarian areas</text>
  <text start="829.72" dur="5.94">from all of this are saying that these</text>
  <text start="831.73" dur="6.63">havens will then just emerged out of</text>
  <text start="835.66" dur="5.779">these areas which will then allow the</text>
  <text start="838.36" dur="5.459">United States to bring in more troops</text>
  <text start="841.439" dur="4.871">there&amp;#39;s only one problem with this plan</text>
  <text start="843.819" dur="7.77">which this paper goes into it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="846.31" dur="7.35">presence of Russia Russia stop this from</text>
  <text start="851.589" dur="4.62">happening now you can see the United</text>
  <text start="853.66" dur="4.169">States is in Syria right now they built</text>
  <text start="856.209" dur="3.841">two bases the French are in there they</text>
  <text start="857.829" dur="6.211">built a base they have special op teams</text>
  <text start="860.05" dur="6.57">in there the UK France United States</text>
  <text start="864.04" dur="4.14">they all have teams in there and the</text>
  <text start="866.62" dur="6.779">reason why they&amp;#39;re in there is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="868.18" dur="7.13">building these safe haven areas but we</text>
  <text start="873.399" dur="4.411">can see right now Russia and the</text>
  <text start="875.31" dur="5.56">expansion of the Russian activities</text>
  <text start="877.81" dur="7.68">across the country this poses a problem</text>
  <text start="880.87" dur="7.29">for the u.s. so Russia&amp;#39;s stepped in they</text>
  <text start="885.49" dur="6.81">destroyed the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="888.16" dur="6.239">fighting al-nusrah al-qaeda and they can</text>
  <text start="892.3" dur="5.909">the United States cannot carve out these</text>
  <text start="894.399" dur="6.75">areas so what does the u.s. do at this</text>
  <text start="898.209" dur="5.67">point they are stuck this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="901.149" dur="4.321">continually telling Putin a listen you</text>
  <text start="903.879" dur="3.45">need to stop the fighting over here you</text>
  <text start="905.47" dur="3.63">need to stop the fighting in Aleppo no</text>
  <text start="907.329" dur="3.75">more bombing we should stop it for a</text>
  <text start="909.1" dur="3.479">week of course we know why this is</text>
  <text start="911.079" dur="5.01">because they want to build up their</text>
  <text start="912.579" dur="9.95">forces to attack once again but we can</text>
  <text start="916.089" dur="11.011">see right now Putin and Assad they are</text>
  <text start="922.529" dur="9.43">right there and they&amp;#39;re ready to call</text>
  <text start="927.1" dur="8.94">victory in Syria unless something else</text>
  <text start="931.959" dur="7.521">occurs there and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="936.04" dur="8.31">watching because as time goes on and the</text>
  <text start="939.48" dur="9.52">u.s. continually losses in these areas</text>
  <text start="944.35" dur="8.789">and actually loses Aleppo this is going</text>
  <text start="949" dur="7.61">to be a major problem and once they lose</text>
  <text start="953.139" dur="6.12">a lepa which is a strategic location</text>
  <text start="956.61" dur="6.069">what does the u.s. have left here why</text>
  <text start="959.259" dur="4.111">they even in there because when Russia</text>
  <text start="962.679" dur="5.281">and</text>
  <text start="963.37" dur="8.159">Syria get rid of the Islamic state the</text>
  <text start="967.96" dur="7.35">u.s. they what&amp;#39;s their explanation of</text>
  <text start="971.529" dur="6.661">being inside a sovereign country they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="975.31" dur="6.84">there to fight terrorism well they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="978.19" dur="7.5">use that why are they there the curd</text>
  <text start="982.15" dur="7.8">area is still part of the government of</text>
  <text start="985.69" dur="6.839">Assad they&amp;#39;re not separate they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="989.95" dur="5.7">under the umbrella there&amp;#39;s still part of</text>
  <text start="992.529" dur="7.171">the country and right now time is</text>
  <text start="995.65" dur="6.21">ticking down the US government is going</text>
  <text start="999.7" dur="3.84">to have to make a move and this is what</text>
  <text start="1001.86" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re watching actually if we look at</text>
  <text start="1003.54" dur="7.02">the Middle East right now the entire</text>
  <text start="1006.27" dur="6.72">Middle East is a gigantic failure for</text>
  <text start="1010.56" dur="4.98">the United States and prop up the</text>
  <text start="1012.99" dur="4.32">petrodollar because we see the start of</text>
  <text start="1015.54" dur="5.27">August the United States had to go back</text>
  <text start="1017.31" dur="7.23">into Libya we see this problems in Yemen</text>
  <text start="1020.81" dur="8.23">problems in Lebanon problems in Iraq</text>
  <text start="1024.54" dur="7.529">Syria they can&amp;#39;t move forward with so</text>
  <text start="1029.04" dur="5.549">when we look at this and we look at</text>
  <text start="1032.069" dur="6.721">these countries the entire area was</text>
  <text start="1034.589" dur="9.84">created by the United States to create</text>
  <text start="1038.79" dur="9.6">this petro dollar system as each one of</text>
  <text start="1044.429" dur="7.921">these areas collapses and the puppet</text>
  <text start="1048.39" dur="8.31">governments no longer exists the petro</text>
  <text start="1052.35" dur="6.51">dollar well it&amp;#39;s doomed because these</text>
  <text start="1056.7" dur="4.859">governments are no longer going to use</text>
  <text start="1058.86" dur="6.71">the dollar they will turn to something</text>
  <text start="1061.559" dur="6.801">else to sell the oil once that happens</text>
  <text start="1065.57" dur="6.609">which we&amp;#39;re gaming very very close to</text>
  <text start="1068.36" dur="7.63">the entire economic system the reserve</text>
  <text start="1072.179" dur="7.201">dollar of the world what kind of ceases</text>
  <text start="1075.99" dur="5.88">to exist because each country does not</text>
  <text start="1079.38" dur="7.14">have to keep these dollars in reserves</text>
  <text start="1081.87" dur="6.45">to pay for the oil and where do these</text>
  <text start="1086.52" dur="4.74">dollars go well they go back to the</text>
  <text start="1088.32" dur="5.16">United States when they come back to the</text>
  <text start="1091.26" dur="4.68">United States what happens we have a</text>
  <text start="1093.48" dur="3.87">flood of dollars here which means a</text>
  <text start="1095.94" dur="4.17">devaluation of the</text>
  <text start="1097.35" dur="6.89">which means inflation here in the United</text>
  <text start="1100.11" dur="6.9">States and we are getting to that point</text>
  <text start="1104.24" dur="6.4">which will then once this happens and</text>
  <text start="1107.01" dur="6.21">the dollar starts collapsing that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="1110.64" dur="4.1">you see the stock market fall apart this</text>
  <text start="1113.22" dur="4.47">is when you see the derivatives bubble</text>
  <text start="1114.74" dur="5.89">implode this is when you see the housing</text>
  <text start="1117.69" dur="5.93">crash this is when you see people on the</text>
  <text start="1120.63" dur="5.31">streets saying what just happened here</text>
  <text start="1123.62" dur="4.57">so think about all these different</text>
  <text start="1125.94" dur="6.239">scenarios right now that are happening</text>
  <text start="1128.19" dur="5.9">all at once because it&amp;#39;s not just about</text>
  <text start="1132.179" dur="6.151">the stock market this is all</text>
  <text start="1134.09" dur="6.1">interconnected and this is why you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1138.33" dur="3.81">been preparing for all of this now we</text>
  <text start="1140.19" dur="4.349">know the US government is not just going</text>
  <text start="1142.14" dur="4.56">to let this happen without blaming</text>
  <text start="1144.539" dur="3.991">someone else of course they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1146.7" dur="3.75">continually try to prop this up to the</text>
  <text start="1148.53" dur="4.32">very very end so they can get their</text>
  <text start="1150.45" dur="5.06">story in so they can say hey it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1152.85" dur="5.49">us it wasn&amp;#39;t the central bank it was</text>
  <text start="1155.51" dur="5.86">this country it was this group it was</text>
  <text start="1158.34" dur="5.19">this terrorist group and we can see</text>
  <text start="1161.37" dur="5.429">they&amp;#39;re going to use cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="1163.53" dur="5.279">they&amp;#39;re going to use physical attacks to</text>
  <text start="1166.799" dur="3.931">explain away what is really going on</text>
  <text start="1168.809" dur="3.12">here just like back in nineteen seventy</text>
  <text start="1170.73" dur="4.02">one where we&amp;#39;re coming off the gold</text>
  <text start="1171.929" dur="5.671">standard this was the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="1174.75" dur="4.62">Fiat system and that&amp;#39;s why we had all</text>
  <text start="1177.6" dur="4.92">this inflation this is why they told us</text>
  <text start="1179.37" dur="4.77">there there was no more oil because</text>
  <text start="1182.52" dur="3">everything was readjusting they were</text>
  <text start="1184.14" dur="4.11">making deals out in the Middle East now</text>
  <text start="1185.52" dur="6.84">we&amp;#39;re on the opposite end things are</text>
  <text start="1188.25" dur="5.549">coming to an end think about it once the</text>
  <text start="1192.36" dur="3.62">dollar is no longer used what do you</text>
  <text start="1193.799" dur="4.581">think is going to happen to the oil</text>
  <text start="1195.98" dur="5.26">deliveries here in the United States</text>
  <text start="1198.38" dur="4.21">think back to the 1970s when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1201.24" dur="4.169">coming on the system now we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="1202.59" dur="5.459">off the system it&amp;#39;s going to complete be</text>
  <text start="1205.409" dur="4.621">a complete disaster and the US</text>
  <text start="1208.049" dur="3.24">government realizes this they know</text>
  <text start="1210.03" dur="3.75">what&amp;#39;s happening the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1211.289" dur="3.63">know what&amp;#39;s happening they understand</text>
  <text start="1213.78" dur="4.769">this they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this for</text>
  <text start="1214.919" dur="6.441">a long time and we see that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1218.549" dur="5.661">making preparations for all of this and</text>
  <text start="1221.36" dur="4.75">we know that they&amp;#39;re going to use a</text>
  <text start="1224.21" dur="4.41">cyber attack because we could see</text>
  <text start="1226.11" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ve been building this up where</text>
  <text start="1228.62" dur="4.12">countries are attacking</text>
  <text start="1230.64" dur="3.84">United States so the Obama</text>
  <text start="1232.74" dur="4.62">administration right now is preparing to</text>
  <text start="1234.48" dur="7.74">elevate the stature of the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="1237.36" dur="8.28">Cyber Command which they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="1242.22" dur="5.7">use what&amp;#39;s called cyber bombs on other</text>
  <text start="1245.64" dur="6.51">countries they&amp;#39;ve already been using</text>
  <text start="1247.92" dur="10.62">them on other countries and this new US</text>
  <text start="1252.15" dur="8.33">Cyber Command well it will become what</text>
  <text start="1258.54" dur="4.98">the military calls a unified command</text>
  <text start="1260.48" dur="5.2">equal to combat branches of the military</text>
  <text start="1263.52" dur="4.71">such as the central and Pacific</text>
  <text start="1265.68" dur="7.71">command&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ll be separate and apart</text>
  <text start="1268.23" dur="8.13">from the NSA so this way they can go on</text>
  <text start="1273.39" dur="7.71">the offensive they can attack when they</text>
  <text start="1276.36" dur="8.1">need to attack and we can see why this</text>
  <text start="1281.1" dur="6.66">is all happening right now everything is</text>
  <text start="1284.46" dur="6.06">coming into place because the system is</text>
