  <text start="257.9" dur="6.579">but the trouble hasn&amp;#39;t even started and</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="6.31">we know the plan right now is to round</text>
  <text start="264.479" dur="4.291">up a lot of these individuals not just</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="4.67">here in the US but around the world and</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="6.24">to shift away from this central bank</text>
  <text start="271.7" dur="7.24">economic system and Trump is doing it</text>
  <text start="275.01" dur="6.39">the plan is on schedule he&amp;#39;s using all</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="5.64">the tools of the central bank of the</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="5.1">deep state to manipulate everything to</text>
  <text start="284.58" dur="4.41">make the mainstream media the deep state</text>
  <text start="286.5" dur="4.68">the central bank tongue-tied when they</text>
  <text start="288.99" dur="4.919">talk about the economy he&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="5.19">out there saying jobs jobs jobs the BLS</text>
  <text start="293.909" dur="4.26">just reported that the u.s. added 196</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="5.849">thousand jobs they only expected 170</text>
  <text start="298.169" dur="6.18">7,000 amazing now we all know this is</text>
  <text start="302.219" dur="5.7">room manipulation but that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="304.349" dur="6.41">matter this is part of the plan now very</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="5.78">interestingly we know that Trump and</text>
  <text start="310.759" dur="6.22">others they are working with the Chinese</text>
  <text start="313.699" dur="6.911">to put together this deal and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="316.979" dur="6.3">believe in coincidences but what we see</text>
  <text start="320.61" dur="6.929">happening here is that Trump is using</text>
  <text start="323.279" dur="6">leverage US prosecutors notified Huawei</text>
  <text start="327.539" dur="4.171">and a court filing they intend to use</text>
  <text start="329.279" dur="4.32">classified surveillance evidence gained</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="4.379">through a FISA warrant against the</text>
  <text start="333.599" dur="4.801">Chinese state-owned enterprise a few</text>
  <text start="336.089" dur="3.781">hours later Trump was holding a meeting</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="4.669">in the Oval Office to discuss trade</text>
  <text start="339.87" dur="6.829">issues with the Chinese Vice Premier I</text>
  <text start="343.069" dur="5.831">mean is this a coincidence no it is not</text>
  <text start="346.699" dur="4.39">Trump was out there saying listen we</text>
  <text start="348.9" dur="4.799">have a way to go we are rounding the</text>
  <text start="351.089" dur="4.41">turn and while a deal to end the trade</text>
  <text start="353.699" dur="4.921">war between the US and China isn&amp;#39;t ready</text>
  <text start="355.499" dur="4.861">yet a very monumental agreement may be</text>
  <text start="358.62" dur="3.779">announced in about a month</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="4.47">as talks may continue for about four</text>
  <text start="362.399" dur="6.24">weeks and another two after that and he</text>
  <text start="364.83" dur="7.069">said we&amp;#39;re very well along on the deal</text>
  <text start="368.639" dur="5.821">it&amp;#39;s very complex it&amp;#39;s a very big deal</text>
  <text start="371.899" dur="6.88">it&amp;#39;s one of the biggest deals ever made</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="5.189">maybe the biggest deal ever made he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.779" dur="3.211">saying that they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="379.649" dur="4.591">intellectual property protection talking</text>
  <text start="381.99" dur="4.53">about tariffs and enforcement of the</text>
  <text start="384.24" dur="4.799">deal are all outstanding issues that</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="6.179">haven&amp;#39;t been resolved he said we we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="389.039" dur="6.84">agreed to far more than we&amp;#39;ve left to</text>
  <text start="392.699" dur="6.21">agree to this is a granddaddy of them</text>
  <text start="395.879" dur="4.47">all and it looks like the trade talks</text>
  <text start="398.909" dur="4.35">are heading in the right direction and</text>
  <text start="400.349" dur="6.78">Trump is using leverage to get what he</text>
  <text start="403.259" dur="7.14">wants now right on schedule and we</text>
  <text start="407.129" dur="5.4">talked about this we know Trump the</text>
  <text start="410.399" dur="4.14">Patriots they&amp;#39;re controlling the central</text>
  <text start="412.529" dur="4.98">bank we know they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="414.539" dur="5.731">restructure the central bank and a</text>
  <text start="417.509" dur="4.77">couple reports ago we said listen Trump</text>
  <text start="420.27" dur="5.669">has already stopped the Fed from raising</text>
  <text start="422.279" dur="6.021">rates in 2019 and we know that this</text>
  <text start="425.939" dur="4.181">stabilized the economy for the most part</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="3.83">but</text>
  <text start="430.12" dur="6.299">if the rates just stayed where they were</text>
  <text start="432.13" dur="7.14">or are now the economy would fall apart</text>
  <text start="436.419" dur="6.03">I don&amp;#39;t know if it would make it to 2020</text>
  <text start="439.27" dur="4.41">and this is why we said Trump is</text>
  <text start="442.449" dur="4.921">eventually gonna have to come out and</text>
  <text start="443.68" dur="6.9">say we need the rates lowered what a</text>
  <text start="447.37" dur="6.45">Trump - he&amp;#39;s calling on the Federal</text>

  <text start="660.49" dur="5.05">where we have checks and balances where</text>
  <text start="663.68" dur="5.28">we stop the corruption and if you listen</text>

  <text start="708.09" dur="7.54">that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve never had an audit this</text>
  <text start="711.4" dur="9.29">is why it&amp;#39;s always rejected but the plan</text>
  <text start="715.63" dur="8.22">is to force an audit how do you do that</text>
  <text start="720.69" dur="6.85">you do it with an event you do it with a</text>
