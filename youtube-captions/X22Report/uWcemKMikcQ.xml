  <text start="38.25" dur="5.01">China are at war but the world doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="41.219" dur="3.621">know it yet and we&amp;#39;re going to get into</text>
  <text start="43.26" dur="4.02">that a little bit later in this report</text>

  <text start="51.48" dur="5.129">did a test of the baylin&amp;#39;s one day that</text>
  <text start="54.329" dur="4.5">people woke up and all their bank</text>
  <text start="56.609" dur="3.48">accounts were frozen and the government</text>
  <text start="58.829" dur="3.091">officials were out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="60.089" dur="4.051">don&amp;#39;t worry about it it&amp;#39;s only going to</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="4.02">be for two weeks or so and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="64.14" dur="4.2">to take between eight and ten percent of</text>
  <text start="65.94" dur="4.98">your money and that&amp;#39;s it well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="68.34" dur="3.06">going to be going on for about a year</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="2.96">now</text>
  <text start="71.4" dur="6.06">with capital controls in Cyprus and</text>
  <text start="73.88" dur="5.919">actually they took 47% of the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="6.839">money and replaced it with worthless</text>
  <text start="79.799" dur="7.081">Bank stock and this was a test of the</text>
  <text start="84.299" dur="5.731">FDIC Bank of England document which was</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="5.46">created in December of 2012 and that is</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="4.71">on the x-22 report comp site under</text>
  <text start="92.34" dur="4.44">resources documents and you can go take</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="4.559">a look at that that document has now</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="4.35">been passed around to all the countries</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="4.68">and they have copied it the eurozone</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="4.29">Australia Canada Switzerland and they</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="4.831">have copied it because they are getting</text>
  <text start="105.42" dur="9.119">ready for a ballon now Cyprus has just</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="10.589">announced that they are going to relax</text>
  <text start="114.539" dur="6.72">the capital controls starting next week</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="4.051">we&amp;#39;re going to have to see how this</text>
  <text start="121.259" dur="6.091">turns out and if they actually do it or</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="6.24">they might say we relate we&amp;#39;re relaxing</text>
  <text start="127.35" dur="5.25">the capital controls but we have other</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="3.93">emergency type of controls in effect and</text>
  <text start="132.6" dur="2.31">they might call it by a different name</text>
  <text start="133.62" dur="2.28">we&amp;#39;re going to have to see if they</text>
  <text start="134.91" dur="3.15">actually have done it because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="135.9" dur="4.199">they&amp;#39;ve said this many many times when</text>
  <text start="138.06" dur="2.9">it first happened they said oh one more</text>
  <text start="140.099" dur="3.291">week and they</text>
  <text start="140.96" dur="4.68">one more month Oh another month and then</text>
  <text start="143.39" dur="5.52">you know before you knew it it&amp;#39;s a year</text>
  <text start="145.64" dur="6.12">later so you know all this time people</text>
  <text start="148.91" dur="5.04">have not been able to get their full</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="4.44">amount of their money out of the banks</text>
  <text start="153.95" dur="4.47">and let me just tell you if I was in</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="4.71">Cyprus the first thing I would do once</text>
  <text start="158.42" dur="4.35">they say that capital controls are</text>
  <text start="160.91" dur="3.09">relaxed and you can go ahead and take</text>
  <text start="162.77" dur="1.77">out your money now they might do it in</text>
  <text start="164" dur="2.7">stages</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="4.95">they might say okay today you can do 400</text>
  <text start="166.7" dur="4.32">next week it might be 700 so I mean</text>
  <text start="169.49" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how they actually work</text>
  <text start="171.02" dur="4.41">this out but we will say the first thing</text>
  <text start="173.84" dur="3.48">I would do is start taking as much as I</text>
  <text start="175.43" dur="6.72">possibly could and I think everyone in</text>
  <text start="177.32" dur="9.86">Cyprus is going to do just that now in</text>
  <text start="182.15" dur="7.41">the UK Barclays is laying off around</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="5.23">12,000 people and I&amp;#39;ve been reading and</text>
  <text start="189.56" dur="6.24">seeing other things that other banks are</text>
  <text start="192.41" dur="5.73">going to start laying off a lot of</text>
  <text start="195.8" dur="3.45">employees at this time and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="198.14" dur="3.42">to have to see how this plays out but</text>
  <text start="199.25" dur="4.56">Barclays is saying it has to cut cost</text>
  <text start="201.56" dur="5.37">and you know after announcing its</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="6.81">profits profits and increasing bonuses</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="6.54">for the investment arm they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="4.68">have to let go around twelve twelve</text>
  <text start="213.47" dur="5.7">thousand people and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="215.3" dur="6.3">this same Bank last year let go seven</text>
  <text start="219.17" dur="5.85">thousand six hundred and fifty people so</text>
  <text start="221.6" dur="6.54">the amount of layoffs are going up not</text>
  <text start="225.02" dur="6.84">down so here are more people without</text>
  <text start="228.14" dur="6.42">work people who had full-time nice</text>
  <text start="231.86" dur="4.86">salary jobs are now without work now if</text>
  <text start="234.56" dur="4.65">every other bank is going to start</text>
  <text start="236.72" dur="6.06">reporting layoffs because you have to</text>
  <text start="239.21" dur="6.72">remember back um Mareth Whitney back in</text>
  <text start="242.78" dur="5.79">September so said there were major major</text>
  <text start="245.93" dur="6.75">layoffs that were going to happen in the</text>
  <text start="248.57" dur="6.27">fall of 2013 no it seems like nothing</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="5.429">really happened but now we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="4.47">lot of layoffs coming down the pike and</text>
  <text start="258.109" dur="3.451">I think everything&amp;#39;s just been pushed</text>
  <text start="259.31" dur="4.11">back at this point we&amp;#39;re seeing Barclays</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="3.59">laying off and we&amp;#39;re going to start to</text>
  <text start="263.42" dur="4.52">see other banks and other financial</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="5.32">institutions start to lay off people</text>
  <text start="267.94" dur="4.06">because they you know they understand</text>
  <text start="270.47" dur="3.57">what is going on they understand they</text>
  <text start="272" dur="2.79">can&amp;#39;t keep this propped up and they need</text>
  <text start="274.04" dur="3.51">to reduce</text>
  <text start="274.79" dur="5.88">workforce but again where are all these</text>
  <text start="277.55" dur="5.46">people going to get work where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.67" dur="4.14">going to look for jobs they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="283.01" dur="4.5">to find it out there because if everyone</text>
  <text start="284.81" dur="4.5">else is laying off there is no place for</text>
  <text start="287.51" dur="4.98">them to go and this is what we saw in</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="4.86">2008 all those banks and all those</text>
  <text start="292.49" dur="4.23">financial institutions that were just</text>
  <text start="294.17" dur="4.29">laying off there was no place to go and</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="3.69">you know this is why you have</text>
  <text start="298.46" dur="5.22">underemployment this is why the</text>
  <text start="300.41" dur="5.13">employment rate is really around 30 37</text>
  <text start="303.68" dur="4.11">percent because when there&amp;#39;s no place to</text>
  <text start="305.54" dur="4.22">go you can&amp;#39;t find work and if you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="307.79" dur="5.67">find what you were doing you find John</text>
  <text start="309.76" dur="5.92">jobs that are that pay less or part-time</text>
  <text start="313.46" dur="3.77">work and you work and then that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="315.68" dur="5.16">underemployment is so high and</text>
  <text start="317.23" dur="6.16">unemployment is so high right now and if</text>
  <text start="320.84" dur="4.62">we really look at the economy and I know</text>
  <text start="323.39" dur="3.93">the illusion is out there that</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="6.63">everything is going well the markets</text>
  <text start="327.32" dur="7.35">back up and you know and all eyes on the</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="5.07">S&amp;amp;P they&amp;#39;re all talking about the SP</text>
  <text start="334.67" dur="4.23">going to 1900 they&amp;#39;re all looking at the</text>
  <text start="337.16" dur="4.2">Dow when it&amp;#39;s going up again and</text>
  <text start="338.9" dur="4.35">everyone is saying look the economy is</text>
  <text start="341.36" dur="3.51">still strong the unemployment rates</text>
  <text start="343.25" dur="2.94">coming down to six point six percent</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="4.35">then they will probably come down even</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="4.74">lower again it is hard to look through</text>
  <text start="349.22" dur="3.45">this illusion but it is an illusion all</text>
  <text start="350.93" dur="4.95">these calculations have been manipulated</text>
  <text start="352.67" dur="4.89">to make you believe that we are in a</text>
  <text start="355.88" dur="3.33">recovery and again they have to keep</text>
  <text start="357.56" dur="2.85">telling us that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery the</text>
  <text start="359.21" dur="2.85">president goes out there we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="360.41" dur="3.06">recovery all the financial institutions</text>
  <text start="362.06" dur="3.87">are out there saying we&amp;#39;re in a recovery</text>
  <text start="363.47" dur="4.71">but if you look past that you can see</text>
  <text start="365.93" dur="6.21">what&amp;#39;s really going on we see it by the</text>
  <text start="368.18" dur="6.6">retail sales we see it by the real</text>
  <text start="372.14" dur="4.89">estate sales and the amount of mortgages</text>
  <text start="374.78" dur="3.87">that are being applied people that are</text>
  <text start="377.03" dur="4.29">applying for these mortgages and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.65" dur="4.68">down by 66% you can see that most of the</text>
  <text start="381.32" dur="3.96">houses are purchased with cash from</text>
  <text start="383.33" dur="3.06">hedge funds and investment companies and</text>
  <text start="385.28" dur="3.99">of course they&amp;#39;re getting this money</text>
  <text start="386.39" dur="6.42">from the Fed so we can see what is going</text>
  <text start="389.27" dur="6.21">on around here and we can see that</text>
  <text start="392.81" dur="5.25">things are not going well and if you</text>
  <text start="395.48" dur="3.99">really look and we we look through all</text>
  <text start="398.06" dur="4.29">this we can see that wholesale</text>
  <text start="399.47" dur="5.25">inventories have missed expectations and</text>
  <text start="402.35" dur="5.819">rose at their slowest rate since July</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="3.79">2013 at a mere 0.3% and we also have two</text>
  <text start="408.169" dur="3.491">real</text>
  <text start="408.51" dur="8.25">that the whole sale inventory growth is</text>
  <text start="411.66" dur="8.85">the second slowest in a decade now as we</text>
  <text start="416.76" dur="6.54">can see the gold manipulation is going</text>
  <text start="420.51" dur="4.2">on they continually push down gold every</text>
  <text start="423.3" dur="3.78">time it starts to move up a little bit</text>
  <text start="424.71" dur="4.8">they push back down but if we look at</text>
  <text start="427.08" dur="5.76">what&amp;#39;s going on around the world at</text>
  <text start="429.51" dur="5.94">these cheap inexpensive prices gold</text>
  <text start="432.84" dur="4.59">demand is way up and Dubai</text>
  <text start="435.45" dur="4.04">Gold jewellers just reported the</text>
  <text start="437.43" dur="4.44">strongest gold sales in seven years</text>
  <text start="439.49" dur="4.6">India reported that silver bullion</text>
  <text start="441.87" dur="5.94">imports hit a five-year record from</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="6.48">April 2013 to January 2014 Australia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="6.6">Pressman said gold sales jumped 41% and</text>
  <text start="450.57" dur="7.92">silver 33% in 2013 in January gold</text>
  <text start="454.41" dur="6.84">demand was up 10% and silver 8% Mexico&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.49" dur="4.92">pension funds are now investing in gold</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="5.03">after strict investment regulations were</text>
  <text start="463.41" dur="6.03">recently lifted and countries are</text>
  <text start="466.28" dur="6.76">purchasing more and more gold Turkey</text>
  <text start="469.44" dur="5.7">purchased around 150 tonnes Vietnam 110</text>
  <text start="473.04" dur="5.19">Russia 57 tons</text>
  <text start="475.14" dur="5.31">if we look Ukraine six point two two</text>
  <text start="478.23" dur="5.25">tonnes then as well at one point eight</text>
  <text start="480.45" dur="6.56">seven tonnes Indonesia four tonnes and</text>
  <text start="483.48" dur="7.59">if we look at China they did a record</text>
  <text start="487.01" dur="5.95">1139 tonnes of gold and if we look back</text>
  <text start="491.07" dur="3.72">at the United States and I cannot find</text>
  <text start="492.96" dur="5.07">anything if the United States is</text>
  <text start="494.79" dur="5.76">purchasing any gold whatsoever and I</text>
  <text start="498.03" dur="4.74">can&amp;#39;t find anything out there that even</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="4.77">says they are that the United States is</text>
  <text start="502.77" dur="6.18">purchasing anything but the gold demand</text>
  <text start="505.32" dur="6.36">for 2013 jumped 24 percent in the United</text>
  <text start="508.95" dur="6.029">States and it&amp;#39;s continually increasing</text>
  <text start="511.68" dur="5.82">in 2014 so we can see as these prices</text>
  <text start="514.979" dur="6.571">are coming down people are realizing</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="6.66">that this gold the precious metal market</text>
  <text start="521.55" dur="5.19">is manipulated so they are going out</text>
  <text start="524.16" dur="5.13">there and they&amp;#39;re purchasing more of it</text>
  <text start="526.74" dur="4.59">and again you have to look at look at</text>
  <text start="529.29" dur="5.67">this whole entire thing this way that</text>
  <text start="531.33" dur="6.03">gold silver it is on sale they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.96" dur="4.83">bringing the prices down for you right</text>
  <text start="537.36" dur="4.95">before the economic collapse so go out</text>
  <text start="539.79" dur="5.789">and purchase what you need to purchase</text>
  <text start="542.31" dur="5.67">again gold and silver you know palladium</text>
  <text start="545.579" dur="6.081">platinum any precious metal is an</text>
  <text start="547.98" dur="6.87">insurance policy if the paper currency</text>
  <text start="551.66" dur="5.979">completely declines and plummets and</text>
  <text start="554.85" dur="4.979">collapse and implodes on itself that is</text>
  <text start="557.639" dur="4.411">what the precious metals are for you</text>
  <text start="559.829" dur="3.541">keep them with you you hold on to them</text>
  <text start="562.05" dur="4.139">they&amp;#39;re physical</text>
  <text start="563.37" dur="5.1">and when the new currency comes they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="566.189" dur="5.34">be priced in a completely different way</text>
  <text start="568.47" dur="6.51">and again it is also a hedge against</text>
  <text start="571.529" dur="5.31">inflation so we can see that holding</text>
  <text start="574.98" dur="4.32">precious metals is really not an</text>
  <text start="576.839" dur="9.42">investment it is more like an insurance</text>
  <text start="579.3" dur="9.75">policy okay now with Obamacare we</text>
  <text start="586.259" dur="5.281">understand that employees like Home</text>
  <text start="589.05" dur="5.699">Depot forever21 and many other companies</text>
  <text start="591.54" dur="6">have started to reduce the number of</text>
  <text start="594.749" dur="4.921">hours that people work and they started</text>
  <text start="597.54" dur="5.039">to move people who are full-time maybe</text>
  <text start="599.67" dur="5.25">into some part-time positions and they</text>
  <text start="602.579" dur="5.55">were doing this because they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="604.92" dur="7.19">to spend the extra money or pay for any</text>
  <text start="608.129" dur="7.07">type of penalties that they would occur</text>
  <text start="612.11" dur="6.039">because they because of Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="615.199" dur="5.14">what has happened is more and more</text>
  <text start="618.149" dur="3.93">people were being laid off hours were</text>
  <text start="620.339" dur="3.6">being reduced people weren&amp;#39;t making the</text>
  <text start="622.079" dur="5.37">money just so they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="623.939" dur="4.741">participate in Obamacare and the</text>
  <text start="627.449" dur="3.661">government the White House Obama</text>
  <text start="628.68" dur="5.04">realized this and said whoa whoa whoa</text>
  <text start="631.11" dur="6.719">whoa and they didn&amp;#39;t want to admit it</text>
  <text start="633.72" dur="7.32">but the number of people employed has</text>
  <text start="637.829" dur="5.82">been dropping because of Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="641.04" dur="4.649">again if you know how everyone pretty</text>
  <text start="643.649" dur="6.091">much knows how I feel about Obamacare it</text>
  <text start="645.689" dur="6.63">is not for the people it is a cash grab</text>
  <text start="649.74" dur="6.75">so what did President Obama he saw what</text>
  <text start="652.319" dur="7.14">was happening and he decided that he was</text>
  <text start="656.49" dur="5.909">going to change the health insurance law</text>
  <text start="659.459" dur="5.22">and he was going to delay the employer</text>
  <text start="662.399" dur="4.5">mandate and this is the second time he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.679" dur="5.311">done this he&amp;#39;s going to do this and they</text>
  <text start="666.899" dur="7.651">have until now 2016 but what else did he</text>
  <text start="669.99" dur="5.82">do well he also rewrote some of the oh</text>
  <text start="674.55" dur="7.02">the afford</text>
  <text start="675.81" dur="10.5">Care Act here and and what he did was to</text>
  <text start="681.57" dur="8.1">be eligible for the postponement of the</text>
  <text start="686.31" dur="6.69">mandates of 2016 this is what each</text>
  <text start="689.67" dur="6">employer needs to do they cannot reduce</text>
  <text start="693" dur="4.56">the size of their workforce over the</text>
  <text start="695.67" dur="5.9">overall hours of service of its</text>
  <text start="697.56" dur="7.95">employees unless it can be justified</text>
  <text start="701.57" dur="6.97">through the Internal Revenue Service so</text>
  <text start="705.51" dur="6.21">they have to prove why they are reducing</text>
  <text start="708.54" dur="5.28">people&amp;#39;s hours or getting rid of people</text>
  <text start="711.72" dur="4.41">this is what he has done right now the</text>
  <text start="713.82" dur="3.99">Affordable Care Act as passed by</text>
  <text start="716.13" dur="4.68">Congress says companies with more than</text>
  <text start="717.81" dur="5.24">50 full-time equivalent employees must</text>
  <text start="720.81" dur="6.66">provide minimum essential coverage</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="8.14">starting January 1st 2014 or pay a fine</text>
  <text start="727.47" dur="6.42">and large employers those who have</text>
  <text start="731.19" dur="6.63">hundred or more must provide coverage to</text>
  <text start="733.89" dur="5.91">only 70% of their workers in 2015 but</text>
  <text start="737.82" dur="4.05">the regulations also say that effective</text>
  <text start="739.8" dur="4.2">yesterday employers may not shed</text>
  <text start="741.87" dur="4.2">employees or work hours just to get</text>
  <text start="744" dur="4.38">below the 100 employee threshold and</text>
  <text start="746.07" dur="5.13">thus avoid Obamacare&amp;#39;s penalties for</text>
  <text start="748.38" dur="4.92">another full year so if a company has a</text>
  <text start="751.2" dur="4.98">hundred and one employees and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="753.3" dur="4.71">want to pay what what they&amp;#39;ll do is</text>
  <text start="756.18" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ll you know reduce the hours or lay</text>
  <text start="758.01" dur="6.42">off the people to bring them to ninety</text>
  <text start="760.47" dur="7.05">nine and again he has said absolutely</text>
  <text start="764.43" dur="5.94">not you need to prove why you are doing</text>
  <text start="767.52" dur="6.09">this again if I owned a company I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="770.37" dur="6.09">have to prove to anyone why I&amp;#39;m letting</text>
  <text start="773.61" dur="8">people go and we have to think of it</text>
  <text start="776.46" dur="10.17">this way Obama introduced Obamacare</text>
  <text start="781.61" dur="8.979">making it mandatory for you to get</text>
  <text start="786.63" dur="7.47">insurance for all the employees or pay a</text>
  <text start="790.589" dur="5.071">fine so of course as a business person</text>
  <text start="794.1" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re going to say okay how much is</text>
  <text start="795.66" dur="3.299">the fine how much of the employees can</text>
  <text start="797.52" dur="3.75">we you know reduce it by two or three</text>
  <text start="798.959" dur="5.341">people reduce the hours and those</text>
  <text start="801.27" dur="5.1">companies adjusted now they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="804.3" dur="3.75">them to do this why why don&amp;#39;t they want</text>
  <text start="806.37" dur="3.36">and everyone&amp;#39;s thinking like oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="808.05" dur="3.06">because of the people No</text>
  <text start="809.73" dur="3.18">that&amp;#39;s not why because they can the</text>
  <text start="811.11" dur="3.75">companies can always put the expense</text>
  <text start="812.91" dur="3.72">back on the people if they wanted to</text>
  <text start="814.86" dur="4.409">they don&amp;#39;t or they can make them pay</text>
  <text start="816.63" dur="4.38">half for Obamacare because Obamacare is</text>
  <text start="819.269" dur="3.301">pretty much more expensive than anything</text>
  <text start="821.01" dur="5.189">else and the policies that he&amp;#39;s offering</text>
  <text start="822.57" dur="5.37">are not as good as other policies</text>
  <text start="826.199" dur="4.921">because they have very high deductibles</text>
  <text start="827.94" dur="6.81">what they are doing is they need to</text>
  <text start="831.12" dur="6.329">build the revenue to pay for the u.s.</text>
  <text start="834.75" dur="4.98">debt this is why there is a penalty</text>
  <text start="837.449" dur="5.13">because you have to think when they</text>
  <text start="839.73" dur="6.45">first introduced this the insurance</text>
  <text start="842.579" dur="6.45">companies an Obama thought that if we</text>
  <text start="846.18" dur="5.099">put a penalty on the individual for not</text>
  <text start="849.029" dur="6.62">taking health insurance and on companies</text>
  <text start="851.279" dur="6.691">they would decide to take the insurance</text>
  <text start="855.649" dur="4.361">instead of paying the penalty they were</text>
  <text start="857.97" dur="5.04">trying to force them into taking</text>
  <text start="860.01" dur="6.12">insurance and what they found was that</text>
  <text start="863.01" dur="5.639">the youth where they thought since they</text>
  <text start="866.13" dur="4.709">don&amp;#39;t have a lot of illnesses and they</text>
  <text start="868.649" dur="5.55">don&amp;#39;t get sick that often they would be</text>
  <text start="870.839" dur="5.851">the base of Obamacare and they would be</text>
  <text start="874.199" dur="4.44">paying the premiums to pay for the older</text>
  <text start="876.69" dur="4.649">folks who get sick quite you know uh</text>
  <text start="878.639" dur="5.25">much more than younger people they run</text>
  <text start="881.339" dur="5.661">into problems as you get older and what</text>
  <text start="883.889" dur="7.711">happened was since the youth of America</text>
  <text start="887" dur="7.48">can&amp;#39;t find work they decided so the</text>
  <text start="891.6" dur="4.65">penalty of 1% of nothing is nothing the</text>
  <text start="894.48" dur="4.799">penalty of two percent of nothing isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="896.25" dur="4.949">is nothing or whatever you know part</text>
  <text start="899.279" dur="5.731">time money they&amp;#39;re making I rather just</text>
  <text start="901.199" dur="6.031">pay the penalty then pay for health</text>
  <text start="905.01" dur="3.809">insurance at this point so insurance</text>
  <text start="907.23" dur="4.109">companies are seeing that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="908.819" dur="4.32">bringing in the revenue they decided to</text>
  <text start="911.339" dur="5.031">put all these penalties to force people</text>
  <text start="913.139" dur="6.901">into insurance because again part of</text>
  <text start="916.37" dur="5.949">this insurance plan are hidden taxes</text>
  <text start="920.04" dur="5.039">inside and revenue goes to the</text>
  <text start="922.319" dur="4.741">government and profits go to the</text>
  <text start="925.079" dur="4.921">insurance companies and this is the</text>
  <text start="927.06" dur="5.37">entire system and what it is is a</text>
  <text start="930" dur="4.5">complete cash grab and this is why they</text>
  <text start="932.43" dur="4.649">have implemented all of these penalties</text>
  <text start="934.5" dur="5.01">this is why he&amp;#39;s saying everyone needs</text>
  <text start="937.079" dur="4.62">to be in because this this whole entire</text>
  <text start="939.51" dur="4.04">thing does not work for the government</text>
  <text start="941.699" dur="5.091">if and the insurance companies</text>
  <text start="943.55" dur="6.27">everyone is not in buying the insurance</text>
  <text start="946.79" dur="5.7">and a lot of people who do not have work</text>
  <text start="949.82" dur="6.18">who are underemployed with part-time</text>
  <text start="952.49" dur="5.94">work or have their salary reduced they</text>
  <text start="956" dur="4.23">are not going out and buying health</text>
  <text start="958.43" dur="5.07">insurance this is the problem right now</text>
  <text start="960.23" dur="6.45">and he tried to stop this and again</text>
  <text start="963.5" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re trying to control every aspect</text>
  <text start="966.68" dur="5.67">of business it cannot work because</text>
  <text start="969.8" dur="5.279">people always find a way to get around</text>
  <text start="972.35" dur="4.65">it and eventually when you make no money</text>
  <text start="975.079" dur="3.721">you just say you know what what&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="977" dur="4.35">important I rather spend the money on</text>
  <text start="978.8" dur="4.59">food than pay four hundred five hundred</text>
  <text start="981.35" dur="4.77">dollars a month for health insurance</text>
  <text start="983.39" dur="6.629">which I will most likely not use because</text>
  <text start="986.12" dur="5.969">my deductible is 3000 or 4000 dollars so</text>
  <text start="990.019" dur="4.621">I won&amp;#39;t even see anything from health</text>
  <text start="992.089" dur="4.291">insurance from all the premiums I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="994.64" dur="5.129">paying so it&amp;#39;s not even worth it and</text>
  <text start="996.38" dur="5.37">this is what&amp;#39;s happening today and this</text>
  <text start="999.769" dur="4.701">is why they keep this is why Obama</text>
  <text start="1001.75" dur="5.279">continually wants to change the law and</text>
  <text start="1004.47" dur="6.13">you know make it much more difficult for</text>
  <text start="1007.029" dur="6.601">everyone and this is what he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1010.6" dur="6.09">doing this is like third rewrite that</text>
  <text start="1013.63" dur="4.8">he&amp;#39;s done at this time now a couple</text>
  <text start="1016.69" dur="3.66">reports ago we talked about net</text>
  <text start="1018.43" dur="6.56">neutrality and how this is going to work</text>
  <text start="1020.35" dur="8.79">where is P providers like AT&amp;amp;T Verizon</text>
  <text start="1024.99" dur="6.25">cable companies they can decide what</text>
  <text start="1029.14" dur="4.86">sites you can see which sites you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1031.24" dur="5.76">see and right now AT&amp;amp;T is filing for a</text>
  <text start="1034" dur="5.61">patent we&amp;#39;re part of the patent is they</text>
  <text start="1037" dur="7.62">want you to pay for credits and again</text>
  <text start="1039.61" dur="8.099">this is going to be a very difficult</text>
  <text start="1044.62" dur="4.799">time when it comes to the internet</text>
  <text start="1047.709" dur="4.141">because the internet the way we know it</text>
  <text start="1049.419" dur="3.811">is going to completely change at this</text>
  <text start="1051.85" dur="4.68">time because what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1053.23" dur="5.91">is they&amp;#39;re going to say listen these are</text>
  <text start="1056.53" dur="5.52">the sites that we approve and you can go</text>
  <text start="1059.14" dur="6.27">look at if you don&amp;#39;t if you want to see</text>
  <text start="1062.05" dur="6">another site that we banned you must pay</text>
  <text start="1065.41" dur="4.5">a credit and you can purchase the</text>
  <text start="1068.05" dur="4.44">credits from us and then we&amp;#39;ll let you</text>
  <text start="1069.91" dur="4.62">go see it and there might be other sites</text>
  <text start="1072.49" dur="3.6">where they&amp;#39;ll say you know what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1074.53" dur="2.26">not even going to let you we&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="1076.09" dur="4">going to show you</text>
  <text start="1076.79" dur="6.47">and again these companies like AT&amp;amp;T</text>
  <text start="1080.09" dur="6.96">let&amp;#39;s make that for example if they have</text>
  <text start="1083.26" dur="5.92">streaming videos they might not let you</text>
  <text start="1087.05" dur="4.38">go to Netflix because it&amp;#39;s a competitor</text>
  <text start="1089.18" dur="4.8">and this is what they&amp;#39;re applying for</text>
  <text start="1091.43" dur="6.15">right now the internet the way we know</text>
  <text start="1093.98" dur="4.8">it the control is going fast forward</text>
  <text start="1097.58" dur="4.23">right now because they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1098.78" dur="5.12">definitely control what you see when you</text>
  <text start="1101.81" dur="5">can see it and how you can see it and</text>
  <text start="1103.9" dur="5.68">eventually they want you to pay for it</text>
  <text start="1106.81" dur="6.19">and again they&amp;#39;re the ones who are</text>
  <text start="1109.58" dur="6">telling you what is good which they</text>
  <text start="1113" dur="5.46">approve and which sites are bad which</text>
  <text start="1115.58" dur="5.91">they disapprove on and you know we can</text>
  <text start="1118.46" dur="5.73">see this going forward this is how the</text>
  <text start="1121.49" dur="5.25">control of the Internet is going to</text>
  <text start="1124.19" dur="6.81">start and we can see it happening right</text>
  <text start="1126.74" dur="7.83">in front of our faces okay now as we</text>
  <text start="1131" dur="5.58">know the UN arms treaty is pending in</text>
  <text start="1134.57" dur="3.96">the Senate in the US and and also the</text>
  <text start="1136.58" dur="3.18">Dianne Feinstein bill is still pending</text>
  <text start="1138.53" dur="4.11">in the Senate because they&amp;#39;re waiting</text>
  <text start="1139.76" dur="4.65">for a false flag event to push the</text>
  <text start="1142.64" dur="4.65">agenda forward and if they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1144.41" dur="5.01">these laws passed President Obama might</text>
  <text start="1147.29" dur="4.74">go to the executive orders and try to</text>
  <text start="1149.42" dur="4.11">pass both of these without the approval</text>
  <text start="1152.03" dur="4.95">of Congress and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="1153.53" dur="5.82">that goes but right now in Europe on</text>
  <text start="1156.98" dur="4.14">February 5th the European Parliament</text>
  <text start="1159.35" dur="4.56">voted to authorize European Union</text>
  <text start="1161.12" dur="4.62">countries to ratify the United Nations</text>
  <text start="1163.91" dur="4.38">arms trade treaty</text>
  <text start="1165.74" dur="5.49">so they have already started the</text>
  <text start="1168.29" dur="6.3">disarming of the people in the euro zone</text>
  <text start="1171.23" dur="4.86">many countries are now have weapons here</text>
  <text start="1174.59" dur="3.57">in the US we have the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="1176.09" dur="5.64">but you&amp;#39;re going to see as this goes</text>
  <text start="1178.16" dur="6.69">forward this people who are trying to</text>
  <text start="1181.73" dur="5.22">purchase weapons or get weapons they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1184.85" dur="4.5">going to see their rights being taken</text>
  <text start="1186.95" dur="4.11">away and again they want to push this</text>
  <text start="1189.35" dur="4.02">agenda everywhere because they need</text>
  <text start="1191.06" dur="4.92">everyone disarmed so they can have full</text>
  <text start="1193.37" dur="5.94">control of the people not just in the US</text>
  <text start="1195.98" dur="4.62">in Canada in Australia if you&amp;#39;re not in</text>
  <text start="1199.31" dur="3.09">the UK if you notice some of these</text>
  <text start="1200.6" dur="4.83">countries you know you&amp;#39;re not allowed to</text>
  <text start="1202.4" dur="5.49">even have a weapon and how do you know</text>
  <text start="1205.43" dur="4.359">and every country that we see where they</text>
  <text start="1207.89" dur="4.45">take weapons away what have</text>

  <text start="1212.34" dur="5.339">them we see mass murders we see total</text>
  <text start="1215.19" dur="5.13">control of the people and this has been</text>
  <text start="1217.679" dur="5.031">throughout history that we have seen</text>
  <text start="1220.32" dur="5.609">this now I talked a lot about</text>
  <text start="1222.71" dur="5.769">Afghanistan and many many reports ago I</text>
