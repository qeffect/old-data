  <text start="40.11" dur="5.49">and the top of the episode is trade deal</text>
  <text start="42.3" dur="7.529">in the works time to get rid of federal</text>
  <text start="45.6" dur="6.57">taxes boom let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="49.829" dur="4.951">collapse financial news now it looks</text>
  <text start="52.17" dur="7.23">like we&amp;#39;re getting very very close to</text>
  <text start="54.78" dur="6.809">having this new economy completed for</text>
  <text start="59.4" dur="3.81">the people now remember we have two</text>
  <text start="61.589" dur="5.041">economies going on we have the central</text>
  <text start="63.21" dur="6.12">bank economy which is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="4.59">experiencing now it is collapsing we</text>
  <text start="69.33" dur="5.58">have Trump creating the new economy and</text>
  <text start="71.22" dur="7.31">we know that Trump has been creating</text>
  <text start="74.91" dur="6.66">these new deals with all different</text>
  <text start="78.53" dur="6.58">countries and these are bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="81.57" dur="7.17">agreements this is not a globalist trade</text>
  <text start="85.11" dur="9.27">agreement system anymore Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="10.29">away with it and we knew that the plan</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="7.849">was to have a deal with China Trump and</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="7.11">G were going to meet at the g20 and</text>
  <text start="102.229" dur="9.07">guess what happened trade talks resumed</text>
  <text start="106.14" dur="7.79">from former stalled point it&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="111.299" dur="6.661">what we said was going to happen and</text>
  <text start="113.93" dur="4.54">most likely vice premier Liu he he&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="117.96" dur="5.299">back</text>
  <text start="118.47" dur="7.98">representing Chairman ji Jinping now</text>
  <text start="123.259" dur="6.881">current enhancement tariffs remain in</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="6.03">place the tariffs that were raised when</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="3.319">talks collapse will remain raised and in</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="5.91">force</text>
  <text start="133.459" dur="8.59">China resumes AG purchases likely maybe</text>
  <text start="138.39" dur="6.18">soybeans will be the priority US will</text>
  <text start="142.049" dur="8.461">allow trade purchases exports to one way</text>
  <text start="144.57" dur="9.15">of non national security tech everything</text>
  <text start="150.51" dur="7.14">is in place right now everything is</text>
  <text start="153.72" dur="7.14">moving forward and just like we said the</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="6.119">trade talks are going to resume once</text>
  <text start="160.86" dur="5.519">they hammer out a deal which I do</text>
  <text start="163.769" dur="5.55">believe will be in the next couple of</text>
  <text start="166.379" dur="4.801">weeks or months Trump will keep the</text>
  <text start="169.319" dur="4.261">tariffs in place for a little bit longer</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="4.529">and neither by the end of this year the</text>
  <text start="173.58" dur="6.15">beginning of next year tariffs will</text>
  <text start="175.709" dur="7.14">start to disappear this will leave the</text>
  <text start="179.73" dur="7.95">central bank system the global central</text>
  <text start="182.849" dur="7.621">bank system completely exposed Trump</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="4.68">tweeted out the following I had a great</text>
  <text start="190.47" dur="4.049">meeting with President Xi of China</text>
  <text start="192.36" dur="4.14">yesterday far better than expected I</text>
  <text start="194.519" dur="4.86">agreed not to increase the already</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="5.7">existing tariffs that we charge China</text>
  <text start="199.379" dur="4.951">while we continue to negotiate China has</text>
  <text start="202.2" dur="3.869">agreed that during the negotiation they</text>
  <text start="204.33" dur="3.629">will begin purchasing large amounts of</text>
  <text start="206.069" dur="4.56">agricultural product from our great</text>
  <text start="207.959" dur="5.25">farmers at the request of our high tech</text>
  <text start="210.629" dur="4.321">companies and president GI agreed to</text>
  <text start="213.209" dur="4.321">allow Chinese company Huawei to buy</text>
  <text start="214.95" dur="4.83">product from them which will not impact</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="4.14">our national security importantly we</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="3.84">have opened up negotiations again with</text>
  <text start="221.67" dur="4.02">China as our relationship with them</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="4.11">continues to be a very good one</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="5.01">the quality of the transaction is far</text>
  <text start="227.73" dur="5.399">more important to me than speed I am in</text>
  <text start="230.7" dur="4.44">no hurry but things look very good</text>
  <text start="233.129" dur="4.25">there&amp;#39;ll be no reduction in the tariffs</text>
  <text start="235.14" dur="6.33">currently being charged to China</text>
  <text start="237.379" dur="7.151">so from this summation it would appear</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="5.549">that Trump has created an exit ramp for</text>
  <text start="244.53" dur="4.65">Chairman CheY Jinping that allows him to</text>
  <text start="247.019" dur="4.351">save face however obviously with</text>
  <text start="249.18" dur="5.07">retention of the recent tariff increase</text>
  <text start="251.37" dur="7.26">that benefits beyond optics all favored</text>
  <text start="254.25" dur="9">Trump and Trump is leading the</text>
  <text start="258.63" dur="6.719">negotiations it&amp;#39;s no longer China China</text>
  <text start="263.25" dur="6.63">was leading the negotiations in the past</text>
  <text start="265.349" dur="8.461">China paid certain politicians off to</text>
  <text start="269.88" dur="6.93">get what they wanted and we can see that</text>
  <text start="273.81" dur="6.599">we&amp;#39;re getting closer and closer to this</text>
  <text start="276.81" dur="5.64">new economy it is now taking shape and</text>
  <text start="280.409" dur="5.13">we need to rimmer Trump he&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="282.45" dur="4.8">saying I am in no hurry he&amp;#39;s collecting</text>
  <text start="285.539" dur="3.481">billions and billions from the tariffs</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="5.849">he has the upper hand he</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="8.399">has the leverage and now China will be</text>
  <text start="293.099" dur="6.481">doing what he wants Trump also tweeted</text>
  <text start="297.419" dur="4.081">out the following I am in South Korea</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="4.709">now president moon and I have toasted</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="5.25">our new trade deal are far better one</text>
  <text start="304.289" dur="5.16">for us than which it replaced today I</text>
  <text start="306.75" dur="5.789">will visit with and speak to our troops</text>
  <text start="309.449" dur="5.161">and also go to the DMZ long plan my</text>
  <text start="312.539" dur="4.35">meeting with president moon went very</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="4.83">well I will be talking about Kim jong-un</text>
  <text start="316.889" dur="5.9">and the DMC in the meeting there in the</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="6.539">next report but he continued to tweet</text>
  <text start="322.789" dur="5.31">good information and actually incredible</text>
  <text start="325.979" dur="4.981">information out to the public</text>
  <text start="328.099" dur="4.331">he said the leaders of virtually every</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="3.75">country that I met at the g20</text>
  <text start="332.43" dur="4.47">congratulated me on our great economy</text>
  <text start="334.71" dur="4.799">many countries are having difficulties</text>
  <text start="336.9" dur="4.049">on that score we have the best economy</text>
  <text start="339.509" dur="3.601">anywhere in the world with great and</text>
  <text start="340.949" dur="4.291">unlimited potential looking into the</text>
  <text start="343.11" dur="5.58">future you know of course part of this</text>
  <text start="345.24" dur="6.299">is to get Trump reelected in 2020</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="5.34">showing the world that he&amp;#39;s made the</text>
  <text start="351.539" dur="5.671">United States incredible now this is</text>
  <text start="354.03" dur="4.889">statistically incredible remember that</text>
  <text start="357.21" dur="4.38">part remember this is a central bank</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="5.15">system which he&amp;#39;s making look really</text>
  <text start="361.59" dur="6.06">really good to everyone out there and</text>
  <text start="364.069" dur="5.951">remember he had to do this he had to</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="5.37">make the central bank system look</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="6.179">fantastic because if it collapsed during</text>
  <text start="373.02" dur="6.06">his term here his first term he would</text>
  <text start="376.199" dur="6.06">not be reelected and he needs to be</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="5.55">re-elected to carry out the rest of the</text>
  <text start="382.259" dur="3.81">plan and those countries that are</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="3.12">looking at the United States they</text>
  <text start="386.069" dur="4.71">realize what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="387.75" dur="6.12">they understand his mission is to get</text>
  <text start="390.779" dur="7.711">rid of the central bank and once the</text>
  <text start="393.87" dur="6.87">central bank goes guess what so does the</text>
  <text start="398.49" dur="5.07">federal withholding tax now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="400.74" dur="6.539">interesting right now is this is coming</text>
  <text start="403.56" dur="6.599">out of Fox News Steve dese is out there</text>
  <text start="407.279" dur="5.101">and he put out an article saying this</text>
  <text start="410.159" dur="6.031">revolutionary tax change would bring</text>
  <text start="412.38" dur="7.89">incredible benefits and he went on to</text>
  <text start="416.19" dur="5.91">discuss how we should get rid of the</text>
  <text start="420.27" dur="6.06">federal withholding tax</text>
  <text start="422.1" dur="6.78">this is the initial push out there I</text>
  <text start="426.33" dur="6.09">believe this was put out there on</text>
  <text start="428.88" dur="7.02">purpose to get the conversation started</text>
  <text start="432.42" dur="7.71">remember the central bank it goes in</text>
  <text start="435.9" dur="7.95">hand-in-hand with the IRS because once</text>
  <text start="440.13" dur="7.02">you add interest you needed a secondary</text>
  <text start="443.85" dur="5.76">part to collect the taxes from the</text>
  <text start="447.15" dur="3.99">people to pay for that interest on the</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="5.55">debt this is how the whole thing was</text>
  <text start="451.14" dur="6.81">created and this article goes into the</text>
  <text start="455.16" dur="4.68">founding fathers the federal withholding</text>
  <text start="457.95" dur="4.41">tax let me read a portion of this to you</text>
  <text start="459.84" dur="5.04">the founding principle of government by</text>
  <text start="462.36" dur="5.25">the consent of the governed seems lost</text>
  <text start="464.88" dur="5.16">to history as unelected judges and</text>
  <text start="467.61" dur="3.93">unelected bureaucrats within all the</text>
  <text start="470.04" dur="3.45">endless agencies that make up the</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="4.59">federal at the via phone make most of</text>
  <text start="473.49" dur="5.04">the governing decisions Americans</text>
  <text start="476.13" dur="5.73">rightly feel as if government seems to</text>
  <text start="478.53" dur="6.87">work for every interest but there&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="481.86" dur="6.66">in the past yes that&amp;#39;s what government</text>
  <text start="485.4" dur="5.48">was doing it was all of their interests</text>
  <text start="488.52" dur="7.14">and not the people&amp;#39;s interests anymore</text>
  <text start="490.88" dur="7.09">well everything&amp;#39;s changing it can let me</text>
  <text start="495.66" dur="4.86">continue one policy change could</text>
  <text start="497.97" dur="4.34">radically change all of this immediately</text>
  <text start="500.52" dur="4.86">and it wouldn&amp;#39;t require an</text>
  <text start="502.31" dur="4.66">insurmountable task as would a</text>
  <text start="505.38" dur="4.62">constitutional amendment getting enough</text>
  <text start="506.97" dur="5.04">support in such a balkanized America it</text>
  <text start="510" dur="4.29">also wouldn&amp;#39;t require raising or cutting</text>
  <text start="512.01" dur="5.7">taxes you are establishing or cutting a</text>
  <text start="514.29" dur="6.18">single program to do it if you want to</text>
  <text start="517.71" dur="6.08">change America immediately and most</text>
  <text start="520.47" dur="6.54">likely for the better just end federal</text>
  <text start="523.79" dur="5.77">paycheck withholding I&amp;#39;ve been asked</text>
  <text start="527.01" dur="5.04">several times in my career that what one</text>
  <text start="529.56" dur="5.31">policy I would make happen if I were</text>
  <text start="532.05" dur="5.19">empowered to do so and this is it the</text>
  <text start="534.87" dur="5.25">reason being is simple yet profound if</text>
  <text start="537.24" dur="6.3">the American people had to write that</text>
  <text start="540.12" dur="5.88">check to Washington themselves they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="5.37">a lot more aware of how much of their</text>
  <text start="546" dur="5.79">productivity is being confiscated which</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="4.11">means they&amp;#39;d also be a lot more mindful</text>
  <text start="551.79" dur="3.06">about monitoring the way their</text>
  <text start="553.02" dur="3.509">government is spending their money</text>
  <text start="554.85" dur="4.109">we get back to seeing those in</text>
  <text start="556.529" dur="5.071">government as our employees because</text>
  <text start="558.959" dur="3.68">we&amp;#39;re paying them rather than taking</text>
  <text start="561.6" dur="4.56">from us</text>
  <text start="562.639" dur="6.37">accountability which is all but gone now</text>
  <text start="566.16" dur="4.38">would return about 10% of the American</text>
  <text start="569.009" dur="5.01">workforce are independent contractors</text>
  <text start="570.54" dur="6.06">and thus do pay-as-you-go taxation</text>
  <text start="574.019" dur="4.651">directly to the IRS so the collection</text>
  <text start="576.6" dur="4.62">process necessary to end federal</text>
  <text start="578.67" dur="4.83">paycheck with withholding for everyone</text>
  <text start="581.22" dur="4.679">else is already there and accessed by</text>
  <text start="583.5" dur="4.529">millions of Americans there is literally</text>
  <text start="585.899" dur="4.321">nothing standing in the way of changing</text>
  <text start="588.029" dur="3.87">the dynamic that also would change the</text>
  <text start="590.22" dur="4.26">way Americans view the way their</text>
  <text start="591.899" dur="5.041">government spends ending federal</text>
  <text start="594.48" dur="3.65">paycheck withholding will go a long way</text>
  <text start="596.94" dur="3.18">towards changing the paradigm</text>
  <text start="598.13" dur="4">accordingly because it empowers the</text>
  <text start="600.12" dur="4.8">individual taxpayer instead of making</text>
  <text start="602.13" dur="6.18">the federal tax taker all-powerful as it</text>
  <text start="604.92" dur="6.859">is now let&amp;#39;s make self-governing great</text>
  <text start="608.31" dur="6.42">again and federal paycheck withholding</text>
  <text start="611.779" dur="4.961">so in this article they&amp;#39;re saying let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="614.73" dur="5.4">switch it around instead of just</text>
  <text start="616.74" dur="5.099">removing it and you getting used to the</text>
  <text start="620.13" dur="3.899">paycheck that you&amp;#39;re receiving you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="621.839" dur="6.841">even see the other part of it how about</text>
  <text start="624.029" dur="7.92">everyone writes the check every quarter</text>
  <text start="628.68" dur="7.2">or every month or every two weeks this</text>
  <text start="631.949" dur="9.091">way that people understand and they can</text>
  <text start="635.88" dur="6.42">realize how bad this really is think</text>
  <text start="641.04" dur="2.909">about it for a second think about it</text>
  <text start="642.3" dur="3.959">when you receive your check and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="643.949" dur="5.37">say your check is I don&amp;#39;t know five</text>
  <text start="646.259" dur="6.301">hundred a week or six hundred a week or</text>
  <text start="649.319" dur="6.061">whatever it is and you had a write a</text>
  <text start="652.56" dur="4.019">check for a hundred and fifty let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="655.38" dur="3.389">it&amp;#39;s a thousand you had a write a check</text>
  <text start="656.579" dur="4.591">for three hundred and I left you at</text>
  <text start="658.769" dur="6.81">seven hundred five hundred I left you</text>
  <text start="661.17" dur="6.089">with one fifth but my three fifty you</text>
  <text start="665.579" dur="3.69">would write a check for 150 you would</text>
  <text start="667.259" dur="5.101">write a check for three hundred you</text>
  <text start="669.269" dur="6.211">would see that you&amp;#39;re paying the</text>
  <text start="672.36" dur="8.25">government right now if we switch this</text>
  <text start="675.48" dur="8.13">up and we did this people would start to</text>
  <text start="680.61" dur="6.089">question things people would say why am</text>
  <text start="683.61" dur="4.479">i paying all this money and those people</text>
  <text start="686.699" dur="3.221">who make more</text>
  <text start="688.089" dur="4.5">you know a thousand fifteen hundred two</text>
  <text start="689.92" dur="5.159">thousand a week they&amp;#39;d be saying we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="692.589" dur="5.821">wait a minute why am i writing a check</text>
  <text start="695.079" dur="7.23">every week or every two weeks or every</text>
  <text start="698.41" dur="8.039">month to the government if what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="702.309" dur="7.83">doing is not what I want people would</text>
  <text start="706.449" dur="6.211">question this people would understand</text>
  <text start="710.139" dur="5.43">now and I believe this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="712.66" dur="6.239">stages remember when we get rid of the</text>
  <text start="715.569" dur="6.721">central bank the IRS will go with it</text>
  <text start="718.899" dur="6.48">there&amp;#39;s no need for it because there&amp;#39;s</text>
