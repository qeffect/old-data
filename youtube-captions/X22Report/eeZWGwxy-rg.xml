  <text start="297.68" dur="7.32">fits those people who supported the bill</text>
  <text start="300.699" dur="6.421">but never the people so they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="305" dur="5.18">using propaganda for quite a while to</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="9.1">convince us they&amp;#39;re doing all this for</text>
  <text start="310.18" dur="9.989">our best interests even with the TPP the</text>
  <text start="316.22" dur="8.13">TTIP people are starting to see through</text>
  <text start="320.169" dur="6.22">the propaganda they realize through all</text>
  <text start="324.35" dur="3.39">the leaked information that no this is</text>
  <text start="326.389" dur="5.011">not good for the people actually this is</text>
  <text start="327.74" dur="6.239">actually terrible for the people and we</text>
  <text start="331.4" dur="6.15">can see right now there is a movement</text>
  <text start="333.979" dur="5.91">around the world this is the first step</text>
  <text start="337.55" dur="5.16">first step is getting the real</text>
  <text start="339.889" dur="5.491">information listening to other</text>
  <text start="342.71" dur="5.34">individuals doing the research on your</text>
  <text start="345.38" dur="4.469">own to find out the truth not listening</text>
  <text start="348.05" dur="3.149">to the corporate media not listening to</text>
  <text start="349.849" dur="2.91">the government and taking everything</text>
  <text start="351.199" dur="4.891">they say at face value and say yes</text>
  <text start="352.759" dur="5.611">whatever they say that&amp;#39;s the truth no</text>
  <text start="356.09" dur="4.199">the whole point of the media is to</text>
  <text start="358.37" dur="3.63">question everything is to do research</text>
  <text start="360.289" dur="3.991">and to say well wait a minute this</text>
  <text start="362" dur="6.18">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense you&amp;#39;re lying to us</text>
  <text start="364.28" dur="5.759">you&amp;#39;re using propaganda on us and we can</text>
  <text start="368.18" dur="4.76">see right now it has already started</text>
  <text start="370.039" dur="6.861">because the alternative media has grown</text>
  <text start="372.94" dur="6.19">more people are listening in we see</text>
  <text start="376.9" dur="5.739">protests around the world saying you</text>
  <text start="379.13" dur="6.92">know something we reject the TTIP we</text>
  <text start="382.639" dur="6.21">don&amp;#39;t want it that couldn&amp;#39;t get traction</text>
  <text start="386.05" dur="7.119">we see protests against the central</text>
  <text start="388.849" dur="6.6">bank&amp;#39;s and it is starting very slowly</text>
  <text start="393.169" dur="6.961">but wait there&amp;#39;s more that needs to be</text>
  <text start="395.449" dur="6.451">done we see out in Yemen now we know out</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="4.59">in Yemen the United States government</text>
  <text start="401.9" dur="7.92">central banks placed a puppet government</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="7.02">in there and the Hootie&amp;#39;s decided you</text>
  <text start="409.82" dur="3.51">know something we don&amp;#39;t want the central</text>
  <text start="411.74" dur="5.88">bank we don&amp;#39;t want the US government in</text>
  <text start="413.33" dur="7.98">our country so the United States had</text>
  <text start="417.62" dur="6.21">Saudi Arabia bomb yemen yemen never</text>
  <text start="421.31" dur="5.609">attacked anyone but we can see that the</text>
  <text start="423.83" dur="4.26">president of Yemen that was placed in</text>
  <text start="426.919" dur="4.141">there by the United Sates government</text>

  <text start="431.06" dur="6.72">the who thiis went to the United Nations</text>
  <text start="433.46" dur="7.05">and they put in a bid to form their own</text>
  <text start="437.78" dur="5.55">government to set up a rival</text>
  <text start="440.51" dur="7.82">administration and they wanted to be</text>
  <text start="443.33" dur="7.68">recognized internationally and the UN</text>
  <text start="448.33" dur="5.83">rejected this but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="451.01" dur="5.07">interesting on the UN website they have</text>
  <text start="454.16" dur="4.14">the declaration on the on granting the</text>
  <text start="456.08" dur="5.67">independence to colonial countries and</text>

  <text start="476.419" dur="4.111">social or educational preparedness</text>

  <text start="494.41" dur="5.11">to say this government is not working</text>
  <text start="497.419" dur="3.741">for us and this is what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>

  <text start="546.77" dur="8.54">are fighting back and we can see right</text>
  <text start="553.07" dur="5.28">now through the rejection of the UN</text>
  <text start="555.31" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re not even following their own</text>
  <text start="558.35" dur="5.08">mandate now yesterday we reported on</text>
  <text start="561.7" dur="4.55">Iraq enter</text>
  <text start="563.43" dur="6.21">where the iraqi prime minister told</text>

  <text start="569.64" dur="5.009">not invite you in we don&amp;#39;t want you here</text>
  <text start="572.339" dur="5.821">and if you stay there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="574.649" dur="8.821">problems now Iraq is a sovereign country</text>
  <text start="578.16" dur="8.64">they have every right to say to soldiers</text>
  <text start="583.47" dur="8.16">that are in their country to get out but</text>
  <text start="586.8" dur="8.729">turkey responded to Iraq Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="591.63" dur="6.72">yield Durham said no the Turkish troops</text>
  <text start="595.529" dur="9.951">will remain in the camp in northern Iraq</text>
  <text start="598.35" dur="10.23">and we&amp;#39;re not leaving even though Iraq</text>
  <text start="605.48" dur="6.79">objects to it it makes no difference we</text>
  <text start="608.58" dur="5.699">are staying now we have the same</text>
  <text start="612.27" dur="5.61">situation in most of these countries</text>
  <text start="614.279" dur="5.671">where turkey the United States France UK</text>
  <text start="617.88" dur="6.42">and other nations believe they have the</text>
  <text start="619.95" dur="8.79">right to go into a country and stay in a</text>
  <text start="624.3" dur="5.88">country even if the sovereign government</text>
  <text start="628.74" dur="3.9">the elected government tells them to</text>
  <text start="630.18" dur="5.43">leave can you imagine if this happened</text>
  <text start="632.64" dur="5.04">here in the United States if North Korea</text>
  <text start="635.61" dur="3.87">decided to bring in troops into the</text>
  <text start="637.68" dur="4.74">United States and said listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="639.48" dur="4.44">creating a base here we&amp;#39;re going to take</text>
  <text start="642.42" dur="3.03">over this piece of land we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="643.92" dur="4.919">create a base we&amp;#39;re going to bring in</text>
  <text start="645.45" dur="4.56">soldiers military assets and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="648.839" dur="3.271">care what you say what you want us to</text>
  <text start="650.01" dur="7.32">leave no we&amp;#39;re not leaving this is what</text>
  <text start="652.11" dur="11">the United States turkey the UK and the</text>
  <text start="657.33" dur="10.23">rest are doing in these countries why</text>
  <text start="663.11" dur="7.45">because their entire mission is to keep</text>
  <text start="667.56" dur="6.51">control of the Middle East and they can</text>
  <text start="670.56" dur="6.39">care less what the government&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="674.07" dur="6.86">about it so what that really means is</text>
  <text start="676.95" dur="6.87">that they violated international laws</text>
  <text start="680.93" dur="8.8">they don&amp;#39;t care what elected governments</text>
  <text start="683.82" dur="10.68">have to say and they are invading these</text>
  <text start="689.73" dur="7.18">countries starting a war on purpose now</text>
  <text start="694.5" dur="5.74">we know out in Syria the</text>
  <text start="696.91" dur="5.06">situation is not improving for the</text>
  <text start="700.24" dur="6.71">United States we see Syria and Russia</text>
  <text start="701.97" dur="9.22">they are just about to take over Aleppo</text>
  <text start="706.95" dur="6.34">which means the United States there&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="711.19" dur="3.42">be no reason for them to stay in Syria</text>
  <text start="713.29" dur="4.17">but of course they&amp;#39;re not going to leave</text>
  <text start="714.61" dur="5.52">and the real reason the US can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="717.46" dur="7.43">separate the moderates from al-qaeda and</text>
  <text start="720.13" dur="7.53">al-nusrah is because there really isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="724.89" dur="6.87">moderate rebels there&amp;#39;s nothing to</text>
  <text start="727.66" dur="7.02">separate they&amp;#39;re all one in the same and</text>
  <text start="731.76" dur="7.63">when you really look at what is going on</text>
  <text start="734.68" dur="7.55">in Aleppo we see the vast majority of</text>
  <text start="739.39" dur="6.09">Aleppo&amp;#39;s remaining two million residents</text>
  <text start="742.23" dur="5.38">live in command control territory with</text>
  <text start="745.48" dur="4.46">less than a quarter of a million trapped</text>
  <text start="747.61" dur="6.15">in terrorist health sections of the city</text>
  <text start="749.94" dur="5.23">not only do 1.75 million of Aleppo&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="753.76" dur="2.82">million residents live in</text>
  <text start="755.17" dur="4.11">government-controlled sections of the</text>
  <text start="756.58" dur="4.74">city but militant groups held up in</text>
  <text start="759.28" dur="4.38">districts awaiting liberation are not</text>
  <text start="761.32" dur="5.13">even entirely made up of Syrians but</text>
  <text start="763.66" dur="8.04">rather foreigners who entered the</text>
  <text start="766.45" dur="8.19">country this entirely undermines the</text>
  <text start="771.7" dur="7.14">West narrative that Syria is undergoing</text>
  <text start="774.64" dur="6.63">a civil war rather than a foreign</text>
  <text start="778.84" dur="4.11">orchestrated invasion because when you</text>
  <text start="781.27" dur="6.93">really look at the terrorists that are</text>
  <text start="782.95" dur="9.6">there that a paid mercenaries 99.5</text>
  <text start="788.2" dur="8.58">percent are foreigners they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="792.55" dur="6.15">Syrian and we can see right now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="796.78" dur="4.14">they can&amp;#39;t separate the moderates from</text>
  <text start="798.7" dur="5.58">terrace because there are no moderates</text>
  <text start="800.92" dur="5.52">the 2007 report clearly explains why the</text>
  <text start="804.28" dur="4.47">u.s. cannot separate its alleged</text>
  <text start="806.44" dur="4.19">moderate rebels from al Qaeda and its</text>

  <text start="1074.25" dur="6.03">well they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a way</text>
  <text start="1077.01" dur="6.78">to create a situation where it looks</text>
  <text start="1080.28" dur="6.06">like the united states had to do this</text>
  <text start="1083.79" dur="5.7">because they were either attacked or for</text>

  <text start="1089.49" dur="3.98">they&amp;#39;ve been this is the end game this</text>
  <text start="1091.05" dur="6.18">is the plan they&amp;#39;re working on right now</text>
  <text start="1093.47" dur="5.26">now Russia has announced that they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1108.69" dur="6.39">stop the United States from removing</text>
  <text start="1111" dur="8.19">Assad because we see the UN came out</text>
  <text start="1115.08" dur="7.979">with a report and they warned that the</text>
  <text start="1119.19" dur="6.44">terrorists held area of Aleppo will be</text>

  <text start="1137.85" dur="7.5">central bankers they have from now until</text>
  <text start="1140.72" dur="8.74">Christmas to initiate their plan because</text>
  <text start="1145.35" dur="6.51">otherwise they lose Aleppo and we can</text>
  <text start="1149.46" dur="6.12">see that they&amp;#39;re going to do whatever it</text>
  <text start="1151.86" dur="5.699">takes if it means war they will go down</text>
