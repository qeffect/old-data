  <text start="99.649" dur="4.161">out now and the timing is just</text>
  <text start="101.149" dur="5.61">unbelievable why because they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="103.81" dur="5.619">propaganda now if you read this very</text>
  <text start="106.759" dur="5.461">closely they&amp;#39;re making it seem like it</text>
  <text start="109.429" dur="5.55">was russia&amp;#39;s fault because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="112.22" dur="7.47">saying that the airline was taken down</text>
  <text start="114.979" dur="9.301">by a buch warhead which was designed and</text>
  <text start="119.69" dur="7.62">created by russia but when you really</text>
  <text start="124.28" dur="6.21">read into it they&amp;#39;re not saying who did</text>
  <text start="127.31" dur="7.17">it they&amp;#39;re saying what inanimate object</text>
  <text start="130.49" dur="7.35">brought it down and it&amp;#39;s an older buk</text>
  <text start="134.48" dur="6.39">missile system which Kiev owned and</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="6.229">operated but they don&amp;#39;t mention this and</text>
  <text start="140.87" dur="7.41">this is not what the report was about</text>
  <text start="144.069" dur="6.701">the Dutch Safety Board basically said</text>
  <text start="148.28" dur="4.35">that they&amp;#39;re not going to determine who</text>
  <text start="150.77" dur="4.26">is responsible they were just going to</text>
  <text start="152.63" dur="4.71">give evidence of what brought it down</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="3.69">but the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="157.34" dur="3.48">government central bankers wanted this</text>
  <text start="158.72" dur="5.07">release right now and they wanted it to</text>
  <text start="160.82" dur="3.65">say Russian buch system so people in</text>
  <text start="163.79" dur="2.54">their heads</text>
  <text start="164.47" dur="4.59">believed it was Russia that brought it</text>
  <text start="166.33" dur="4.02">down but what why in the world and we</text>
  <text start="169.06" dur="4.02">mentioned this and we discussed this</text>
  <text start="170.35" dur="6.09">many times why in the world with the</text>
  <text start="173.08" dur="7.46">rebels shoot down this airline we have</text>
  <text start="176.44" dur="7.1">to remember certain things here Kiev</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="6.85">directed the plane told it where to fly</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="6.37">what altitude to fly at we understand</text>
  <text start="187.39" dur="6.27">they were build holes on the side of the</text>
  <text start="189.91" dur="8.19">airliner we understand they were fighter</text>
  <text start="193.66" dur="6.54">jets flying behind it and we also</text>
  <text start="198.1" dur="4.08">understand that Putin&amp;#39;s jet was flying</text>
  <text start="200.2" dur="4.759">in the area at the same time and it</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="7.11">looks very very similar to the Malaysian</text>
  <text start="204.959" dur="6.161">airliner that was shot down so what</text>
  <text start="209.29" dur="3.24">would the rebels gain by this pretty</text>
  <text start="211.12" dur="3.45">much nothing because they&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="212.53" dur="4.23">for independence and the world would</text>
  <text start="214.57" dur="5.25">look at them and say they just shot down</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="5.79">an airliner why would they do this what</text>
  <text start="219.82" dur="4.56">benefit would it give Ukraine for doing</text>
  <text start="222.55" dur="4.62">this ah they could blame it on the</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="5.82">rebels and say see they are terrorists</text>
  <text start="227.17" dur="4.59">look what they&amp;#39;ve just done but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.2" dur="3.84">many people out there thinking that they</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="5.97">were really aiming for Putin and not the</text>
  <text start="234.04" dur="8.34">Malaysian airliner so when we look at</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="9.539">this and there&amp;#39;s a Russian defense</text>
  <text start="242.38" dur="8.01">company almaz aunty did some experiments</text>
  <text start="247.269" dur="7.741">and they&amp;#39;re saying yes an old book model</text>
  <text start="250.39" dur="8.19">fired the missile and basically it</text>
  <text start="255.01" dur="8.88">detonated right outside the airliner</text>
  <text start="258.58" dur="8.33">right outside the cockpit and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.89" dur="6.6">saying the strike came from the Kyiv</text>
  <text start="266.91" dur="5.77">side now they handed this over to the</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="5.07">Dutch investigators but they rejected it</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="4.29">they didn&amp;#39;t want to see it and in the</text>
  <text start="275.56" dur="2.97">course of their experiment it became</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="4.259">absolutely evident that in the Malaysian</text>
  <text start="278.53" dur="5.22">Boeing that was down by a moot by a</text>
  <text start="281.229" dur="5.671">missile system it was done with an old</text>
  <text start="283.75" dur="5.91">boot model which does not have TT iron</text>
  <text start="286.9" dur="4.11">strike elements the outcome of the</text>
  <text start="289.66" dur="4.35">experiment was sent over to the Dutch</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="5.51">investigators and they did not want to</text>
  <text start="294.01" dur="2.51">take this into consideration</text>
  <text start="297.34" dur="3.6">but of course what we&amp;#39;re seeing out in</text>
  <text start="299.29" dur="4.02">the corporate media and of course they</text>
  <text start="300.94" dur="4.56">released us at this point in time it was</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="8.04">basically be it&amp;#39;s basically being used</text>
  <text start="305.5" dur="8.66">as propaganda right now now in Japan we</text>
  <text start="311.35" dur="6.27">see that the Okinawa governor is saying</text>
  <text start="314.16" dur="7.21">listen you&amp;#39;re not building the US air</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="6.92">base in our area he revoked the approval</text>
  <text start="321.37" dur="8.46">for work needed to relocate the US base</text>
  <text start="324.54" dur="7.21">but the Government of Japan said they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.83" dur="4.86">still proceeding with the plan they</text>
  <text start="331.75" dur="5.16">don&amp;#39;t care what the people say so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="3.9">get once again the government&amp;#39;s are not</text>
  <text start="336.91" dur="3.479">listening to the people and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.59" dur="6.54">doing what they want why are they</text>
  <text start="340.389" dur="8.461">pushing so hard to have this built why</text>
  <text start="345.13" dur="5.25">do they want a bigger air base where</text>
  <text start="348.85" dur="4.17">they can bring in more advanced weapons</text>
  <text start="350.38" dur="6.48">because they know eventually we will be</text>
  <text start="353.02" dur="6.179">getting into World War three and they</text>
  <text start="356.86" dur="7.49">need this built they need the advanced</text>
  <text start="359.199" dur="8.011">weapons in this location Iran right now</text>
  <text start="364.35" dur="5.65">the Parliament just voted in favor of</text>
  <text start="367.21" dur="5.55">the nuclear deal with the world powers</text>
  <text start="370" dur="5.7">and again this is a cover story of what</text>
  <text start="372.76" dur="5.45">is really going on of course they use</text>
  <text start="375.7" dur="6.24">this as saying yes you know will only</text>
  <text start="378.21" dur="6.54">create this much uranium will allow</text>
  <text start="381.94" dur="5.49">inspectors in but behind all of this</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="5.86">it&amp;#39;s really about the u.s. getting into</text>
  <text start="387.43" dur="4.83">the country setting up and controlling</text>
  <text start="390.61" dur="4.14">the central bank and putting the oil on</text>
  <text start="392.26" dur="4.29">the US dollar now that the deal has been</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="4.26">approved by the lower house it needs</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="4.23">endorsement by the Guardian Council of</text>
  <text start="399.01" dur="4.11">the Constitution consisting of clerics</text>
  <text start="400.78" dur="5.58">once the council approves the bill it</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="5.76">will then go into law so right now they</text>
  <text start="406.36" dur="4.59">still have another step to do other</text>
  <text start="408.88" dur="5.25">countries are getting ready to do</text>
  <text start="410.95" dur="6.17">business the United States right now not</text>
  <text start="414.13" dur="6.9">doing business with Iran whatsoever</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="7.84">because we understand Congress is being</text>
  <text start="421.03" dur="5.73">pressured to stop the deal and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.96" dur="5.76">having bits of a problem here our</text>
  <text start="426.76" dur="5.7">government is basically</text>
  <text start="430.72" dur="4.05">King orders from different entities at</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="3.66">this time the Obama administration is</text>
  <text start="434.77" dur="3.21">being controlled by corporations and</text>
  <text start="436.12" dur="4.62">central banks Congress is being</text>
  <text start="437.98" dur="6.15">controlled by other foreign countries</text>
  <text start="440.74" dur="9.65">like Israel and they&amp;#39;re clashing at this</text>
  <text start="444.13" dur="9.96">time remember we had warnings in Chad in</text>
  <text start="450.39" dur="7.96">South Africa in Libya about terrorism</text>
  <text start="454.09" dur="6.3">well terrorism struck in Chad and Russia</text>
  <text start="458.35" dur="4.44">condemns the series of terrorist attacks</text>
  <text start="460.39" dur="5.13">in Chad which killed about 40 people and</text>
  <text start="462.79" dur="5.46">injured more than 50 citizens the</text>
  <text start="465.52" dur="4.59">attacks came on October 10th there were</text>
  <text start="468.25" dur="5.31">suicide bombers that blew themselves up</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="5.46">and of course the u.s. is saying ah we</text>
  <text start="473.56" dur="5.22">can bring in troops we can help out here</text>
  <text start="475.57" dur="7.23">and we know in every place in Africa or</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="7.92">other places we know once the u.s. gives</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="5.76">a warning we know their objective is to</text>
  <text start="486.7" dur="4.14">bring in troops because we know that</text>
  <text start="488.56" dur="4.41">Russia and China are in these countries</text>
  <text start="490.84" dur="4.44">helping the country build their</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="5.52">infrastructure helping them excavate</text>
  <text start="495.28" dur="4.74">natural resources and the US wants a</text>
  <text start="498.49" dur="4.65">piece of this instead of going in there</text>
  <text start="500.02" dur="7.44">economically they&amp;#39;re going in there with</text>
  <text start="503.14" dur="7.35">terrorism and we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="507.46" dur="6.329">United States basically is a sponsor of</text>
  <text start="510.49" dur="6.75">terrorism around the globe I mean the</text>
  <text start="513.789" dur="6.781">State Department was trying to figure</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="7.349">out how the Free Syrian Army got these</text>
  <text start="520.57" dur="5.94">Toyota trucks and they were asking</text>
  <text start="524.589" dur="5.941">questions they were questioning Toyota</text>
  <text start="526.51" dur="5.73">and then we finally found out that these</text>
  <text start="530.53" dur="4.83">trucks were delivered to the Free Syrian</text>
  <text start="532.24" dur="4.59">Army which really doesn&amp;#39;t exist and they</text>
  <text start="535.36" dur="5.22">were handed over right to the Islamic</text>
  <text start="536.83" dur="6.69">state and al-qaeda and who gave them the</text>
  <text start="540.58" dur="6">trucks the State Department and we knew</text>
  <text start="543.52" dur="5.1">this already but of course when we</text>
  <text start="546.58" dur="4.8">mentioned it a while back everyone said</text>
  <text start="548.62" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s crazy why would that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="551.38" dur="4.709">the US government would never give them</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="8.03">this type of equipment well we have to</text>
  <text start="556.089" dur="8.011">understand the Free Syrian Army is fake</text>
  <text start="561.72" dur="2.98">once the people are trained they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="564.1" dur="2.25">brought right</text>
  <text start="564.7" dur="5.22">to the Islamic state all the weapons are</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="4.83">brought into the Islamic state basically</text>
  <text start="569.92" dur="4.05">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="6.75">bankers supports terrorism they use</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="8.88">terrorism around the world now Russia</text>
  <text start="577.93" dur="8.34">has hit 86 Isis targets during 88</text>
  <text start="582.85" dur="5.31">sorties in the last 24 hours and right</text>
  <text start="586.27" dur="4.23">now the Islamic state militants have</text>
  <text start="588.16" dur="5.04">lost most of their ammunition heavy</text>
  <text start="590.5" dur="5.1">vehicles and equipment from the Russian</text>
  <text start="593.2" dur="6.27">airstrikes and they are definitely on</text>
  <text start="595.6" dur="7.97">the run here and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="599.47" dur="6.57">that they&amp;#39;re finding that since they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="603.57" dur="5.08">looking for ammo and they have a huge</text>
  <text start="606.04" dur="6.35">shortage of arms and ammunition they are</text>
  <text start="608.65" dur="5.76">retreating and fleeing from the area</text>
  <text start="612.39" dur="4.36">interceptions of radio talks between</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="4.65">field commanders in the provinces of</text>
  <text start="616.75" dur="3.87">Hama and Homs show that the militants</text>
  <text start="619.06" dur="3.9">are experiencing a shortage of</text>
  <text start="620.62" dur="3.93">ammunition for small arms and grenade</text>
  <text start="622.96" dur="3.72">launchers some field commanders are</text>
  <text start="624.55" dur="4.65">advancing demands to their leaders that</text>
  <text start="626.68" dur="4.08">they will pull out all their groupings</text>
  <text start="629.2" dur="4.47">from the fighting areas unless</text>
  <text start="630.76" dur="5.46">ammunition is replenished and out of the</text>
  <text start="633.67" dur="6.42">blue the United States government</text>
  <text start="636.22" dur="6.03">central bankers flew in 50 tons of ammo</text>
  <text start="640.09" dur="4.26">and whatever else was in those crates</text>
  <text start="642.25" dur="5.37">because we&amp;#39;re not we don&amp;#39;t know this for</text>
  <text start="644.35" dur="5.58">sure that it was just a mo that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="647.62" dur="6.69">has been reported but I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="649.93" dur="7.95">other weapons in the crates now Putin is</text>
  <text start="654.31" dur="5.01">asking that these weapons and ammunition</text>
  <text start="657.88" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s being delivered to the Free</text>
  <text start="659.32" dur="5.51">Syrian Army they&amp;#39;re most likely going to</text>
  <text start="661.87" dur="5.55">fall into the hands of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="664.83" dur="5.14">Putin is asking where the weapons</text>
  <text start="667.42" dur="5.91">Washington is still delivering are going</text>
  <text start="669.97" dur="4.98">to now now that they announced that they</text>
  <text start="673.33" dur="4.02">are supplying the Free Syrian Army with</text>
  <text start="674.95" dur="4.89">weapons and ammunition where is this</text>
  <text start="677.35" dur="5.09">free syrian army because Russia is</text>
  <text start="679.84" dur="5.4">having a very hard time locating it if</text>
  <text start="682.44" dur="4.92">they just unload and throw these arms</text>
  <text start="685.24" dur="5.34">and weapons and ammunition out of the</text>
  <text start="687.36" dur="5.89">airplanes how do they how can they</text>
  <text start="690.58" dur="4.7">guarantee that it&amp;#39;s not going to fall</text>
  <text start="693.25" dur="5.19">into the hands of the Islamic state well</text>
  <text start="695.28" dur="6.01">the thing is</text>
  <text start="698.44" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s going period that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="701.29" dur="5.97">it&amp;#39;s not going to the free syrian army</text>
  <text start="703.42" dur="6.15">because they do not exist well how do we</text>
  <text start="707.26" dur="5.37">know the free syrian army doesn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="709.57" dur="5.55">while coming out of global research we</text>
  <text start="712.63" dur="4.47">note that the FSA units were created</text>

  <text start="734.95" dur="7.83">until the colonel was injured in 2012 in</text>

  <text start="751.18" dur="6.78">FSA went into liquidation they broke up</text>

  <text start="790.21" dur="5.28">has never supplied arms and equipment to</text>
  <text start="792.55" dur="6.9">the FSA because it kind of fell apart</text>
  <text start="795.49" dur="7.23">and disappeared ninety percent of the</text>

  <text start="836.56" dur="3.63">the Free Syrian Army that is made up of</text>
  <text start="838.51" dur="2.94">al-qaeda and then we have the moderate</text>
