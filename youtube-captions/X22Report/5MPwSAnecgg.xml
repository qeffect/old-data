  <text start="90.979" dur="6.481">state they&amp;#39;ve been trying to push the</text>
  <text start="94.52" dur="4.349">idea that what Trump is doing out there</text>
  <text start="97.46" dur="4.109">with his tariffs and everything else</text>
  <text start="98.869" dur="7.11">all&amp;#39;s economic policies that it would</text>

  <text start="105.979" dur="7.051">the United States that it would ruin the</text>
  <text start="109.789" dur="4.981">global economy now we really need to</text>
  <text start="113.03" dur="4.17">step back for a moment and really think</text>
  <text start="114.77" dur="4.799">about what has been happening here we</text>
  <text start="117.2" dur="4.709">know the globalists they have been</text>
  <text start="119.569" dur="4.771">setting up their trade deals they</text>
  <text start="121.909" dur="4.111">established organizations they made it</text>
  <text start="124.34" dur="4.5">seem like this is in the best interest</text>
  <text start="126.02" dur="6">of the everyday person then Trump came</text>
  <text start="128.84" dur="6.99">along and kind of put a wrench in their</text>
  <text start="132.02" dur="6.66">plan and since that time when he came</text>
  <text start="135.83" dur="5.25">into office they thought that they had</text>
  <text start="138.68" dur="5.04">him trapped and those who were working</text>
  <text start="141.08" dur="4.8">with him all trapped there was going to</text>
  <text start="143.72" dur="4.739">be no way out of this they had complete</text>
  <text start="145.88" dur="5.4">control now remember the central banking</text>
  <text start="148.459" dur="5.881">establishment the the deep state they</text>
  <text start="151.28" dur="6.33">have had complete control of the entire</text>
  <text start="154.34" dur="6.47">system for a very long time and they</text>
  <text start="157.61" dur="6.99">thought this was going to be easy-peasy</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="6.73">no problem it was going to work</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="5.16">Oh perfectly where they would be able to</text>
  <text start="167.54" dur="5.61">blame everything on Trump well guess</text>
  <text start="169.76" dur="5.58">what&amp;#39;s been happening the opposite they</text>
  <text start="173.15" dur="5.94">are now trapped because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="175.34" dur="6.81">expect what is happening right now now</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="4.26">we know the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="182.15" dur="2.7">mainstream media and the rest have been</text>
  <text start="183.35" dur="3.27">saying you know all these tariffs in the</text>
  <text start="184.85" dur="3.51">place it&amp;#39;s going to hurt the steel</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="4.08">industry it&amp;#39;s going to hurt everything</text>
  <text start="188.36" dur="5.64">who&amp;#39;s gonna pay for all this it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="190.7" dur="6.15">to hurt everything really what was</text>
  <text start="194" dur="5.19">happening was the globalist trade deals</text>
  <text start="196.85" dur="3.96">that they put in place that is what was</text>
  <text start="199.19" dur="5.42">hurting everything here in the United</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="7.2">States all the regulations all the taxes</text>
  <text start="204.61" dur="5.65">now when you start to undo this and you</text>
  <text start="208.01" dur="4.65">start to remove a lot of this what</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="5.67">happens everything starts to open up</text>
  <text start="212.66" dur="6.75">even if you put tariffs into place you</text>
  <text start="215.93" dur="6.92">are still better off than having a</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="5.49">globalist trade system in place and</text>
  <text start="222.85" dur="3.25">we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about this in</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="5.4">just a little bit and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="226.1" dur="7.74">media now has to admit what is happening</text>
  <text start="230.3" dur="6.09">but first let&amp;#39;s go out to the UK now we</text>
  <text start="233.84" dur="5.49">see that the EU in the UK they have</text>
  <text start="236.39" dur="5.4">approved a brexit divorce deal and this</text>
  <text start="239.33" dur="6.12">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s all over all this</text>
  <text start="241.79" dur="7.59">means is that the leaders they decided</text>
  <text start="245.45" dur="6.42">okay we are now in agreement and now we</text>
  <text start="249.38" dur="5.19">move to the next step what is the next</text>
  <text start="251.87" dur="7.55">step well the agreement has to be</text>
  <text start="254.57" dur="7.8">endorsed or rejected by British MPs and</text>
  <text start="259.42" dur="5.65">what this means is that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="8.13">be headed into this transition period</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="8.61">and most likely the UK the EU will be in</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="4.68">this transition period for a very long</text>
  <text start="273.68" dur="3.06">time I think this has been their plan</text>
  <text start="275.18" dur="4.11">all along maybe it will turn out</text>
  <text start="276.74" dur="5.88">completely different but this agreement</text>
  <text start="279.29" dur="6.09">is not really for the people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="5.25">weighted towards the EU and of course as</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="4.41">we know the central bank will never let</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="4.77">a country just leave their system</text>
  <text start="289.79" dur="6.09">completely it&amp;#39;s completely impossible</text>
  <text start="292.64" dur="5.1">and the UK and the rest of the European</text>
  <text start="295.88" dur="4.439">nations who want to leave</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="4.109">well the central bank will threaten they</text>
  <text start="300.319" dur="4.47">will fight they will do whatever they</text>
  <text start="301.849" dur="6.091">possibly can do keep them in this system</text>
  <text start="304.789" dur="6.331">and what we&amp;#39;re going to see right now is</text>
  <text start="307.94" dur="6.539">that there&amp;#39;s going to be a huge fight</text>
  <text start="311.12" dur="5.669">there&amp;#39;s going to be a battle and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="314.479" dur="3.84">gonna probably say that this is a</text>
  <text start="316.789" dur="3.72">transition period and you&amp;#39;ll see the</text>
  <text start="318.319" dur="4.171">transition period lasts for two months</text>
  <text start="320.509" dur="4.88">three months six months a year two years</text>
  <text start="322.49" dur="6.14">and they&amp;#39;ll continue fight over it and</text>
  <text start="325.389" dur="7.301">the central bankers love this because as</text>
  <text start="328.63" dur="6.879">both sides are fighting guess what the</text>
  <text start="332.69" dur="5.61">UK never leaves they&amp;#39;re still exactly</text>
  <text start="335.509" dur="5.761">where if they&amp;#39;ve always been stuck with</text>
  <text start="338.3" dur="4.859">the EU now we know that the people they</text>
  <text start="341.27" dur="5.1">voted and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before in the</text>
  <text start="343.159" dur="5.491">past the deep state the central bankers</text>
  <text start="346.37" dur="3.69">the establishment they don&amp;#39;t work for</text>
  <text start="348.65" dur="3.12">the people they don&amp;#39;t care what the</text>
  <text start="350.06" dur="4.44">people say you can see it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="7.769">self-evident when the people in Greece</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="10.289">voted to put tsipras into power it was</text>
  <text start="359.539" dur="7.651">under the entire idea that tsipras was</text>
  <text start="364.789" dur="7.47">going to go against the central bank he</text>
  <text start="367.19" dur="7.62">really didn&amp;#39;t the brexit was voted on to</text>
  <text start="372.259" dur="5.041">say hey we the people here in the UK</text>
  <text start="374.81" dur="6.359">don&amp;#39;t want to be part of the EU system</text>
  <text start="377.3" dur="7.08">and we the people want to break free of</text>
  <text start="381.169" dur="5.451">it and guess what&amp;#39;s happening it really</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="5.67">is not going in the way of the people</text>
  <text start="386.62" dur="5.769">this is not what the people wanted but</text>
  <text start="390.05" dur="4.859">again the people who are leading us</text>
  <text start="392.389" dur="4.68">today in certain countries they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="394.909" dur="4.56">following what the people want they</text>
  <text start="397.069" dur="4.861">don&amp;#39;t care how low their ratings are it</text>
  <text start="399.469" dur="4.771">makes no difference they make you think</text>
  <text start="401.93" dur="4.109">and believe that they&amp;#39;re working for the</text>
  <text start="404.24" dur="5.16">people but in the background they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="406.039" dur="5.1">working for unelected leaders and this</text>
  <text start="409.4" dur="4.889">is the problem with Trump in the United</text>
  <text start="411.139" dur="5.911">States they don&amp;#39;t have control over him</text>
  <text start="414.289" dur="4.44">they are nervous and afraid of him they</text>
  <text start="417.05" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t like what he&amp;#39;s doing because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="418.729" dur="4.801">not following protocol and you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="421.34" dur="4.77">to see as time goes on he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="423.53" dur="5.16">move further and further away from what</text>
  <text start="426.11" dur="5.32">the central bank wants what the deep</text>
  <text start="428.69" dur="5.59">state wants what everybody wants and</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="6.03">the calls and the screams and the</text>
  <text start="434.28" dur="6.17">carrying on from that side is going to</text>
  <text start="437.46" dur="7.02">get louder and louder in the meantime</text>
  <text start="440.45" dur="6.76">the plan is to bring the central bank</text>
  <text start="444.48" dur="5.54">economy to its knees and the only way to</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="5.43">do this is to implode it destroy it</text>
  <text start="450.02" dur="5.38">right now we&amp;#39;re seeing that u.s.</text>
  <text start="452.64" dur="6.42">fast-food outlets they were experiencing</text>
  <text start="455.4" dur="6.66">a 2.6 percent drop in customers during</text>
  <text start="459.06" dur="4.59">September verse a year ago and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.06" dur="5.4">starting to see that these types of</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="5.55">restaurants they are declining very very</text>
  <text start="467.46" dur="4.8">rapidly we&amp;#39;re also seeing other</text>
  <text start="469.2" dur="4.95">restaurants where they&amp;#39;re declining very</text>
  <text start="472.26" dur="4.44">very rapidly now know everyone is not</text>
  <text start="474.15" dur="5.04">getting there fast food online what this</text>
  <text start="476.7" dur="5.79">means is one people are probably looking</text>
  <text start="479.19" dur="5.28">for a healthier option number two this</text>
  <text start="482.49" dur="5.1">is becoming too expensive for people to</text>
  <text start="484.47" dur="5.22">go out and buy this type of food this is</text>
  <text start="487.59" dur="4.53">why we see the restaurant traffic</text>
  <text start="489.69" dur="5.04">declining every single day in the</text>
  <text start="492.12" dur="5.16">housing market we&amp;#39;re seeing that home</text>
  <text start="494.73" dur="4.89">builders they are starting to panic and</text>
  <text start="497.28" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of the same</text>
  <text start="499.62" dur="5.49">thing that we saw back in 2008 they are</text>
  <text start="502.17" dur="6.15">now offering price cuts of more than a</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="5.52">hundred thousand dollars along with free</text>
  <text start="508.32" dur="6.06">upgrades such as media rooms cabinets</text>
  <text start="510.63" dur="5.4">and blinds this is how desperate they</text>
  <text start="514.38" dur="4.56">are getting because they understand and</text>
  <text start="516.03" dur="5.85">they realize that the entire system is</text>
  <text start="518.94" dur="5.28">not doing what it did before and what is</text>
  <text start="521.88" dur="3.45">that what was it doing before well the</text>
  <text start="524.22" dur="5.22">central banks were pumping up the</text>
  <text start="525.33" dur="6.57">bubbles the deep state the president at</text>
  <text start="529.44" dur="4.89">the time they all went along with the</text>
  <text start="531.9" dur="4.95">Federal Reserve and everything was</text>
  <text start="534.33" dur="4.1">moving along smoothly and they made</text>
  <text start="536.85" dur="4.32">people believe that everything was great</text>
  <text start="538.43" dur="4.33">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting since then that</text>
  <text start="541.17" dur="4.2">everything has not been great that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.76" dur="4.89">one gigantic illusion and we knew what</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="4.71">their plan was at that time it was to</text>
  <text start="547.65" dur="3.6">make everyone feel comfortable making</text>
  <text start="550.08" dur="4.89">everyone believe that everything was</text>
  <text start="551.25" dur="5.85">great have some type of war an event to</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="5.76">explain why the entire system came down</text>
  <text start="557.1" dur="4.89">and why everyone had a sacrifice tighten</text>
  <text start="560.73" dur="4.97">their belts</text>
  <text start="561.99" dur="8.69">now that plan is out the window</text>
  <text start="565.7" dur="7.42">the new plan is to bring the system down</text>
  <text start="570.68" dur="3.88">make it look like and use the</text>
  <text start="573.12" dur="2.88">manipulation they&amp;#39;ve been using for a</text>
  <text start="574.56" dur="3.99">very long time when I say they I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="576" dur="5.76">talking about the administration in the</text>
  <text start="578.55" dur="4.95">past the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="581.76" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating the economy</text>
  <text start="583.5" dur="4.77">for a very long time you use their</text>
  <text start="584.94" dur="5.1">manipulation against them make it look</text>
  <text start="588.27" dur="3.96">like the economy is doing better than</text>
  <text start="590.04" dur="6.15">ever this way they can&amp;#39;t blame Trump</text>
  <text start="592.23" dur="6.33">they tried to blame Trump on his tariff</text>
  <text start="596.19" dur="3.54">policy where they were saying well the</text>
  <text start="598.56" dur="3.06">tariffs that are being put into place</text>
  <text start="599.73" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s going to hurt all the industries</text>

  <text start="686.91" dur="4.95">tariffs into place we heard all the</text>
  <text start="689.1" dur="4.77">economists saying how bad this was going</text>

  <text start="693.87" dur="3.95">bring down the economy this is when</text>
  <text start="695.3" dur="3.93">Trump started to manipulate the data did</text>
  <text start="697.82" dur="4.35">he do it on his own is this something</text>
  <text start="699.23" dur="5.31">new now he used what the central bank</text>
  <text start="702.17" dur="5.849">the deep state has done in the past it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="704.54" dur="5.88">the same manipulation he&amp;#39;s just pushing</text>
  <text start="708.019" dur="5.851">it to the extreme so this way they can&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="719.18" dur="8">what these tariffs have done to the</text>
  <text start="722.269" dur="7.5">country guess what it&amp;#39;s done nothing</text>
  <text start="727.18" dur="5.2">what they identified was that</text>
  <text start="729.769" dur="5.401">approximately 4.5 percent of the tariffs</text>
  <text start="732.38" dur="7.29">is being carried by the American</text>
  <text start="735.17" dur="7.07">consumer now the rest of it twenty point</text>
  <text start="739.67" dur="6.24">five percent has been absorbed by</text>
  <text start="742.24" dur="7.36">Chinese producers now this is coming out</text>
  <text start="745.91" dur="8.16">of Bloomberg and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="749.6" dur="10.32">Trump is succeeding in making China pay</text>
  <text start="754.07" dur="9.63">most of the cost of his trade war so</text>
  <text start="759.92" dur="6.75">this paper this report that came out</text>
  <text start="763.7" dur="5.91">from the econ poll Europe a network of</text>
  <text start="766.67" dur="5.46">researchers in the European Union US</text>
  <text start="769.61" dur="6.06">company companies and consumers will</text>
  <text start="772.13" dur="6.84">only pay four and a half percent more</text>
  <text start="775.67" dur="6.45">than the nation imposed twenty five</text>
  <text start="778.97" dur="5.76">percent tariffs on the 250 billion of</text>
  <text start="782.12" dur="7.77">Chinese goods and the other twenty point</text>
  <text start="784.73" dur="9.26">five percent is China so did this</text>
  <text start="789.89" dur="6.86">destroy the economy are we seeing prices</text>
  <text start="793.99" dur="7.75">skyrocket like they said by 25 percent</text>
  <text start="796.75" dur="7.81">no and we know that four and a half</text>
  <text start="801.74" dur="7.05">percent is really nothing compared to</text>
  <text start="804.56" dur="7.649">the inflation from the devaluing of the</text>
  <text start="808.79" dur="5.039">dollar so everything that they talked</text>
  <text start="812.209" dur="5.101">about everything that they said about</text>
  <text start="813.829" dur="5.811">the economy falling apart because of</text>
  <text start="817.31" dur="5.31">these tariffs has not come true</text>
  <text start="819.64" dur="5.02">remember when you&amp;#39;re unwinding the</text>
  <text start="822.62" dur="3.81">globalist trade deals which are</text>
  <text start="824.66" dur="3.33">absolutely terrible right from the</text>
  <text start="826.43" dur="2.55">beginning because they weren&amp;#39;t in the</text>
  <text start="827.99" dur="2.76">best interest of the</text>
  <text start="828.98" dur="3.69">people of the United States it was in</text>
  <text start="830.75" dur="5.459">the best interest of the central bank</text>
  <text start="832.67" dur="6">the deep state it was pushed into place</text>
  <text start="836.209" dur="4.171">for a specific reason and that was to</text>
  <text start="838.67" dur="4.109">move everything out of the United States</text>
  <text start="840.38" dur="5.19">company&amp;#39;s manufacturing and make sure</text>
  <text start="842.779" dur="7.531">they never came back here never came</text>
  <text start="845.57" dur="7.769">back because of regulations taxes and no</text>
  <text start="850.31" dur="5.67">incentives and then they set up these</text>
  <text start="853.339" dur="5.911">awful trade deals like NAFTA they were</text>
  <text start="855.98" dur="4.95">trying to push TPP and the rest they set</text>
  <text start="859.25" dur="3.69">up the World Trade Organization remember</text>
  <text start="860.93" dur="5.7">all of this is part of the central</text>
  <text start="862.94" dur="6.899">banking system all of it was to push a</text>
  <text start="866.63" dur="5.49">certain agenda now that you&amp;#39;re unwinding</text>
  <text start="869.839" dur="4.61">all this now that you&amp;#39;re removing all of</text>
  <text start="872.12" dur="4.68">this you&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="874.449" dur="3.94">everything that they put in place was</text>
  <text start="876.8" dur="4.77">absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="878.389" dur="5.041">and even though Trump is putting tariffs</text>
  <text start="881.57" dur="3.78">into place and saying you know something</text>
  <text start="883.43" dur="5.7">we need to even the playing field we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="885.35" dur="6.26">not seeing a really big hit from what he</text>
  <text start="889.13" dur="5.88">is doing actually it&amp;#39;s having the</text>
  <text start="891.61" dur="5.74">opposite effect of what the mainstream</text>
  <text start="895.01" dur="5.009">media the deep state the financial</text>
  <text start="897.35" dur="5.07">planets have been saying because</text>
  <text start="900.019" dur="5.01">remember we&amp;#39;ve been living in a central</text>
  <text start="902.42" dur="4.409">bank economy that has been so fake we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="905.029" dur="4.651">been living in such an illusionary world</text>
  <text start="906.829" dur="5.07">we don&amp;#39;t even know what a free market is</text>
  <text start="909.68" dur="5.269">anymore we didn&amp;#39;t even know what a real</text>
  <text start="911.899" dur="6.391">trade deal is that&amp;#39;s good for the people</text>
  <text start="914.949" dur="7.241">because we&amp;#39;ve been kept in this fake</text>
  <text start="918.29" dur="6.44">world of their economy and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="922.19" dur="5.43">starting to be unraveled right now</text>
  <text start="924.73" dur="6.549">Trump has trapped them with his policies</text>
  <text start="927.62" dur="5.61">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is the</text>
  <text start="931.279" dur="6.381">establishment the deep state the</text>
  <text start="933.23" dur="8.039">rothschild they are pushing all of these</text>
  <text start="937.66" dur="6.63">articles out there trying to give the</text>
  <text start="941.269" dur="6.271">Fed a way out of what they are doing</text>
  <text start="944.29" dur="5.62">this is coming out of Barron&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="947.54" dur="3.81">Fed could back down on rate hikes</text>
  <text start="949.91" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re giving them reasons at</text>
  <text start="951.35" dur="4.26">ammunition to say you know something we</text>
  <text start="953.66" dur="3.09">really don&amp;#39;t have to raise the interest</text>
  <text start="955.61" dur="4.289">rates anymore actually if you remember</text>
  <text start="956.75" dur="5.71">christine lagarde way back she didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="959.899" dur="6.431">like the Fed raising the rates</text>
  <text start="962.46" dur="5.75">it was completely against it and then</text>
  <text start="966.33" dur="4.44">all of a sudden she changed her tune</text>
  <text start="968.21" dur="5.29">because it seemed a little ridiculous</text>
  <text start="970.77" dur="5.82">that the IMF the biz and the rest didn&amp;#39;t</text>
