  <text start="55.95" dur="5.72">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.42" dur="7.08">episode 1560 a and today&amp;#39;s it is May 4th</text>
  <text start="61.67" dur="5.88">2018 and the title of the episode is the</text>
  <text start="64.5" dur="5.37">messages clear warnings have been issued</text>
  <text start="67.55" dur="5.62">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="69.87" dur="6.99">financial news now it looks like the job</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="7.59">numbers are out and basically everything</text>
  <text start="76.86" dur="5.4">is following the same exact path as when</text>
  <text start="80.76" dur="3.81">we were with Obama</text>
  <text start="82.26" dur="4.469">nothing has changed the calculations are</text>
  <text start="84.57" dur="4.02">the same and everything is continually</text>
  <text start="86.729" dur="4.021">being manipulated more people are</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="4.86">falling off the job market because they</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="4.979">can&amp;#39;t find jobs and what they do is they</text>
  <text start="93.45" dur="4.169">continually lower the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="4.351">it has been lowered to three point nine</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="4.681">percent and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="100.08" dur="4.35">u.s. generated only a hundred and sixty</text>
  <text start="102.3" dur="4.17">four thousand jobs of course that is</text>
  <text start="104.43" dur="4.95">manipulated it missed the expectations</text>
  <text start="106.47" dur="5.31">of 190,000 and we could see right now</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="4.71">that numbers have been revised things</text>
  <text start="111.78" dur="4.98">have been pushed around and they made</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="5.1">everything look fantastic they lowered</text>
  <text start="116.76" dur="4.1">the unemployment rate to make it seem</text>
  <text start="119.19" dur="4.62">like we&amp;#39;re at full employment and</text>
  <text start="120.86" dur="4.299">basically right now from all the</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="3.15">different indicators from everything</text>
  <text start="125.159" dur="2.401">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at nothing has</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="2.85">changed</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="5.52">the economy is continually declining</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="5.25">bubbles are popping and basically B</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="3.81">people are being pushed out of the</text>
  <text start="135.06" dur="3.81">housing market they&amp;#39;re being pushed out</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="5.22">of the student loan market they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="138.87" dur="5.64">pushed out of the automobile market</text>
  <text start="142.11" dur="4.5">because what is happening here is that</text>
  <text start="144.51" dur="3.96">interest rates are moving up people are</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="5.099">making less money people aren&amp;#39;t making</text>
  <text start="148.47" dur="5.19">the same hourly wage as they were before</text>
  <text start="151.709" dur="4.411">actually that is declining and we can</text>
  <text start="153.66" dur="4.77">see right now that the headline payroll</text>
  <text start="156.12" dur="4.77">numbers well that was a disappointment</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="5.85">the closely watched average hourly</text>
  <text start="160.89" dur="5.099">earnings printed almost a Miss rising</text>
  <text start="164.28" dur="4.29">just point one percent month a month</text>
  <text start="165.989" dur="4.741">below the point two percent expectation</text>
  <text start="168.57" dur="3.74">and two point six percent year-on-year</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="4.289">also missing the two point seven</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="5.07">expectation so when we start to look at</text>
  <text start="175.019" dur="5.041">this we could see that it&amp;#39;s not exactly</text>
  <text start="177.38" dur="5.17">what everyone thinks it is now of course</text>
  <text start="180.06" dur="4.74">what is happening is the government the</text>
  <text start="182.55" dur="3.659">Fed they&amp;#39;re both out there saying that</text>
  <text start="184.8" dur="3.779">the economy is due</text>
  <text start="186.209" dur="4.441">well and basically both of them are</text>
  <text start="188.579" dur="4.44">trying to gain the narrative to blame</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="3.959">the other for the economy coming down</text>
  <text start="193.019" dur="3.72">and when we look at the labor</text>
  <text start="194.609" dur="5.761">participation rate when we look at</text>
  <text start="196.739" dur="7.14">everything else were exactly where we</text>
  <text start="200.37" dur="6.569">were in 2008 actually it&amp;#39;s much worse</text>
  <text start="203.879" dur="5.821">because more more people are out of the</text>
  <text start="206.939" dur="6.811">workforce the unemployment rate is at</text>
  <text start="209.7" dur="5.939">its lowest point since the 70s and if we</text>
  <text start="213.75" dur="3.689">look right now and we go back in time</text>
  <text start="215.639" dur="5.701">and we look at every time we had a</text>
  <text start="217.439" dur="6.511">recession guess what the u3 unemployment</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="5.209">rate which they&amp;#39;ve been quoting has been</text>
  <text start="223.95" dur="6.539">at the lowest point if we go back to</text>
  <text start="226.549" dur="5.261">2008 here we are we&amp;#39;re at a very low</text>
  <text start="230.489" dur="3.301">point actually we&amp;#39;re lower than that</text>
  <text start="231.81" dur="4.649">right now but we went into a recession</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="4.5">if we look at 2001 same exact thing and</text>
  <text start="236.459" dur="3.48">you can see this is a cycle that goes</text>
  <text start="238.29" dur="4.169">back in time all the way back into the</text>
  <text start="239.939" dur="4.14">70s where they have this low</text>
  <text start="242.459" dur="3.241">unemployment and all of a sudden boom</text>
  <text start="244.079" dur="3.66">were in a recession low unemployment</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="4.86">boom were in a recession and this</text>
  <text start="247.739" dur="5.731">continued on this continues over time</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="4.859">and it&amp;#39;s a cycle that has never ended</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="3.75">and here we are they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="255.419" dur="4.53">everything together and basically the</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="6.56">Fed and Trump and the Patriots they are</text>
  <text start="259.949" dur="6.601">now pushing to gain the narrative of</text>
  <text start="263.78" dur="5.5">when this economy comes down because</text>
  <text start="266.55" dur="4.859">whoever gains the narrative they will be</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="5.069">the winner if they can make you know a</text>
  <text start="271.409" dur="5.79">case of why the Fed brought it down why</text>
  <text start="274.349" dur="4.471">the Fed is no good Trump will win if the</text>
  <text start="277.199" dur="3.9">Fed says no it&amp;#39;s because of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.82" dur="4.62">policies then the Fed will win and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="281.099" dur="3.961">have to see how this plays out but at</text>
  <text start="283.44" dur="5.19">this point we can see they&amp;#39;re both</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="6.18">pushing to reach that point we see right</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="4.5">now that Deutsche Bank they have shut</text>
  <text start="291.24" dur="4.709">down the Houston office we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="6.24">laying off thousands of people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="295.949" dur="6">gonna be cutting many do many jobs in</text>
  <text start="299.37" dur="4.59">the bank and we&amp;#39;re gonna see this happen</text>
  <text start="301.949" dur="5.071">in many different banks remember all</text>
  <text start="303.96" dur="5.07">these banks are insolvent the stress</text>
  <text start="307.02" dur="4.079">tests and all these other things this</text>
  <text start="309.03" dur="3.6">was a gigantic illusion to make you</text>
  <text start="311.099" dur="4.831">think that the economy was doing well</text>
  <text start="312.63" dur="4.71">and the banks were sturdy and strong but</text>
  <text start="315.93" dur="3.63">they really aren&amp;#39;t if you look at the</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="4.079">Spanish banks if we look at</text>
  <text start="319.56" dur="3.359">Italian banks if we look at the French</text>
  <text start="321.419" dur="3.691">banks if we look at the German banks</text>
  <text start="322.919" dur="6.061">even the United States at the banks here</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="7.14">it&amp;#39;s completely a disaster area and when</text>
  <text start="328.98" dur="6.48">one thing goes wrong the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="4.98">just gonna come tumbling down we see the</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="4.41">us-china trade talks</text>
  <text start="337.23" dur="5.07">they ended without a deal and we see</text>
  <text start="339.87" dur="4.86">right now that nothing really happened</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="3.9">or came out of this the same thing is</text>
  <text start="344.73" dur="2.909">happening and I don&amp;#39;t think at this</text>
  <text start="346.2" dur="3.96">point in time that they really wanted to</text>
  <text start="347.639" dur="7.561">have a deal remember we are in a central</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="8.67">banking system and we need to get rid of</text>
  <text start="355.2" dur="5.07">this system and start it again not the</text>
  <text start="358.83" dur="4.559">central banking system but we need to</text>
  <text start="360.27" dur="5.25">restart the system without the central</text>
  <text start="363.389" dur="4.621">banks and I think this is what&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="365.52" dur="4.95">pushed right now we see that the global</text>
  <text start="368.01" dur="5.52">economic momentum well it has just</text>
  <text start="370.47" dur="5.52">slowed the most since 2011 now you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="373.53" dur="4.56">your growth of the global leading</text>
  <text start="375.99" dur="5.04">indicator this is from Goldman Sachs it</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="6">shows that everything is slowing down</text>
  <text start="381.03" dur="5.97">growth decreased by 2.6 2% in April</text>
  <text start="384.09" dur="5.07">down from 2.8 percent back in March and</text>
  <text start="387" dur="6.96">we are seeing that on a month on month</text>
  <text start="389.16" dur="7.86">basis the March gli momentum decreased</text>
  <text start="393.96" dur="5.76">by point zero to six percent in April</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="5.269">from point zero four 1% in February and</text>
  <text start="399.72" dur="6.3">it&amp;#39;s continually declining which means</text>
  <text start="402.289" dur="5.861">we&amp;#39;re headed towards a recession now we</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="3.69">talked about how the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="408.15" dur="4.41">going to be out there and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="409.71" dur="4.35">be pointing the finger at Trump to make</text>
  <text start="412.56" dur="3.78">sure that everyone realizes that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.06" dur="4.079">his policies that are bringing down the</text>
  <text start="416.34" dur="4.71">economy now the economy never recovered</text>
  <text start="418.139" dur="5.25">we are living in an illusionary world</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="3.66">they created these statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="423.389" dur="2.34">to make you think that the economy is</text>
  <text start="424.71" dur="3.75">doing very well</text>
  <text start="425.729" dur="4.711">go back to 2008 this is the recent</text>
  <text start="428.46" dur="4.5">recession the Great Recession and you</text>
  <text start="430.44" dur="5.19">can see from that point in time how they</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="5.37">basically created the illusion at that</text>
  <text start="435.63" dur="4.65">time they told you housing was fine they</text>
  <text start="438.33" dur="4.8">told you the corporation&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="440.28" dur="4.77">fantastic everything has been contained</text>
  <text start="443.13" dur="3.81">the subprime securities they are</text>
  <text start="445.05" dur="3.989">triple-a and then we come to find out</text>
  <text start="446.94" dur="4.5">that all of this was a complete lie the</text>
  <text start="449.039" dur="4.231">same thing is happening right now and we</text>
  <text start="451.44" dur="3.3">know from the corporate media</text>
  <text start="453.27" dur="4.26">the article from Bloomberg that we read</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="4.53">yesterday about how Trump&amp;#39;s policies</text>
  <text start="457.53" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s the biggest threat not the</text>
  <text start="459.27" dur="4.26">Federal Reserve policies but the Trump</text>
  <text start="461.13" dur="4.53">policies that&amp;#39;s how we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="463.53" dur="5.699">starting to shift they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="465.66" dur="6.15">maneuver to blame this on Trump now we</text>
  <text start="469.229" dur="4.47">can see that there&amp;#39;s another message out</text>
  <text start="471.81" dur="3.509">there just to make everyone understand</text>
  <text start="473.699" dur="5.611">that this is going to be Trump&amp;#39;s fault</text>
  <text start="475.319" dur="6.75">more than 1,100 US economist signed a</text>

  <text start="551.279" dur="5.461">bankers are starting to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="553.26" dur="6.81">starting to gather the evidence to show</text>
  <text start="556.74" dur="6.06">why the economy is going to fall apart</text>
  <text start="560.07" dur="4.35">and we can see already from the</text>
  <text start="562.8" dur="4.349">different news stories and from these</text>
  <text start="564.42" dur="5.58">thousand economists they are ready to</text>
  <text start="567.149" dur="4.591">point the finger now of course most</text>
  <text start="570" dur="4.2">likely Trump is going to switch this</text>
  <text start="571.74" dur="4.74">around saying that if the economy was so</text>
  <text start="574.2" dur="4.35">strong then it should have weathered</text>
  <text start="576.48" dur="3.27">this storm there should have been no</text>
  <text start="578.55" dur="3.96">problem whatsoever</text>
  <text start="579.75" dur="4.8">why did it break down let&amp;#39;s take a look</text>
  <text start="582.51" dur="3.36">at the numbers let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="584.55" dur="2.249">happening while he has to do is go back</text>
  <text start="585.87" dur="3.329">and</text>
  <text start="586.799" dur="4.38">look at all the calculations and bring</text>
  <text start="589.199" dur="3.93">it up to the entire country the world</text>
  <text start="591.179" dur="4.14">saying listen these numbers have been</text>
  <text start="593.129" dur="4.2">manipulated we&amp;#39;ve done our research we</text>
  <text start="595.319" dur="4.13">went back in time and yes they</text>
  <text start="597.329" dur="5.67">manipulated all these numbers and</text>
  <text start="599.449" dur="6.37">basically he&amp;#39;s going to pin this on the</text>
  <text start="602.999" dur="5.28">previous administrations he&amp;#39;s gonna pin</text>
  <text start="605.819" dur="3.9">this on the Federal Reserve and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="608.279" dur="3.81">gonna say if these numbers have been</text>
  <text start="609.719" dur="5.13">manipulated before then they must be</text>
  <text start="612.089" dur="6">manipulated going back in time and that</text>
  <text start="614.849" dur="5.79">means the Fed they&amp;#39;ve been working their</text>
  <text start="618.089" dur="4.62">policies on these manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="620.639" dur="4.23">maybe we need to look at the Fed to see</text>
  <text start="622.709" dur="6.06">what they&amp;#39;ve been doing because they had</text>
  <text start="624.869" dur="5.61">stimulus we had bailouts why was this if</text>
  <text start="628.769" dur="5.37">this was all manipulated and why didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="630.479" dur="5.4">the economy stay afloat and basically he</text>
  <text start="634.139" dur="3.99">can turn this whole thing around blame</text>
