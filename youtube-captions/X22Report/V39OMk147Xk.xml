  <text start="61.79" dur="5.73">date is March 29th 2018 and the title of</text>
  <text start="65.12" dur="5.54">the episode is brace for the impact it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="67.52" dur="5.43">not if but when the economy collapses</text>
  <text start="70.66" dur="5.89">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.95" dur="5.61">financial news now it&amp;#39;s not about if the</text>
  <text start="76.55" dur="4.59">economy is gonna collapse it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="78.56" dur="5.91">about when and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="81.14" dur="6.15">talking about for quite a while when is</text>
  <text start="84.47" dur="4.83">this system gonna come down now nobody</text>
  <text start="87.29" dur="4.92">has the exact date because things were</text>
  <text start="89.3" dur="4.86">always in motion things are changing one</text>
  <text start="92.21" dur="5.43">minute we thought you know Obama was</text>
  <text start="94.16" dur="7.41">gonna be in office handing it off to</text>
  <text start="97.64" dur="7.26">Clinton and we at that point said okay</text>
  <text start="101.57" dur="5.64">if that does happen we know we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="104.9" dur="3.66">be gonna war we know they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="107.21" dur="3.18">bring down the economy during that</text>
  <text start="108.56" dur="4.47">period of time because this is normally</text>
  <text start="110.39" dur="5.729">what the central bankers do when they</text>
  <text start="113.03" dur="6.149">need to cover up everything but</text>
  <text start="116.119" dur="4.461">everything got switched around Clinton</text>
  <text start="119.179" dur="4.381">wasn&amp;#39;t put in office</text>
  <text start="120.58" dur="5.88">Trump won the election and things have</text>
  <text start="123.56" dur="6.6">changed and since he&amp;#39;s been in office</text>
  <text start="126.46" dur="5.68">things have dramatically changed in the</text>
  <text start="130.16" dur="4.32">economy the way everything&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="132.14" dur="5.97">approached and what is happening around</text>
  <text start="134.48" dur="6.9">the world and what I see happening right</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="6.51">now has completely changed because in</text>
  <text start="141.38" dur="6.24">the past we were up against China we</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="7.07">were up against Russia these were the</text>
  <text start="147.62" dur="7.11">enemies today they are not the enemies</text>
  <text start="151.69" dur="7.81">Trump the administration has been</text>
  <text start="154.73" dur="7.83">working with these countries and working</text>
  <text start="159.5" dur="6.3">with these countries to changed to</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="4.38">change the economic system globally not</text>
  <text start="165.8" dur="4.019">just here in the United States not in</text>
  <text start="166.94" dur="6.39">Europe but everywhere and the only way</text>
  <text start="169.819" dur="7.231">to do this is to get certain leaders</text>
  <text start="173.33" dur="6.6">together and form some type of pact</text>
  <text start="177.05" dur="5.19">behind the scenes to push an agenda to</text>
  <text start="179.93" dur="6.24">push the central banking system out and</text>
  <text start="182.24" dur="5.61">the only way to do this is to bring down</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="4.78">their system</text>
  <text start="187.85" dur="6.22">because they are intertwined they are</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="5.85">like an octopus with many tentacles that</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="5.43">are far reaching into every country and</text>
  <text start="196.8" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re controlling each country with</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="5.73">debt and that is their control and the</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="5.03">only way to get around all of this and</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="5.4">to break them up is to destroy them and</text>
  <text start="208.31" dur="5.68">this is what we see happening right now</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="6.3">now the economy has not been doing well</text>
  <text start="213.99" dur="6.54">for a very long time because under a</text>
  <text start="216.93" dur="4.11">central banking rule you are kept in the</text>
  <text start="220.53" dur="3.21">dark</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="4.8">they put this gigantic illusion in front</text>
  <text start="223.74" dur="4.59">of you making you think that everything</text>
  <text start="225.84" dur="4.74">is great they pull the plug</text>
  <text start="228.33" dur="3.84">they build it up again they make</text>
  <text start="230.58" dur="3.18">everything seem like it&amp;#39;s great they</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="3.72">pull the plug and they keep doing this</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="6.27">over you know the course of their reign</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="7.08">and this is what&amp;#39;s been happening where</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="5.49">we are today is they have nowhere to go</text>
  <text start="242.97" dur="7.2">because they know their system only</text>
  <text start="245.52" dur="8.28">lasts about 45 plus some years and once</text>
  <text start="250.17" dur="6.689">it reaches this point they are stuck the</text>
  <text start="253.8" dur="5.61">debt is too high their system starts to</text>
  <text start="256.859" dur="5.521">crash on its own it&amp;#39;s happened in the</text>
  <text start="259.41" dur="5.31">past they know this and this is why they</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="4.89">were making preparations to move this</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="5.97">system and I think they were trying to</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="5.85">move this and start it up in China and</text>
  <text start="270.69" dur="3.42">of course the new system with the petrol</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="3.24">you want and everything else will be</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="5.22">backed by gold or whether it will be a</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="4.56">confidence booster and eventually what</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="3.69">they would do is they would take over</text>
  <text start="280.92" dur="4.59">the system just like they did here in</text>
  <text start="283.02" dur="4.62">the United States which they did in the</text>
  <text start="285.51" dur="5.67">UK which they did in Spain and France</text>
  <text start="287.64" dur="5.16">and every single other country and while</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="3.72">everyone is feeling comfortable the</text>
  <text start="292.8" dur="4.65">system is great everything&amp;#39;s fantastic</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s checks and balances eventually</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="4.55">what would happen is they would start</text>
  <text start="299.4" dur="5.73">maneuvering to take the system over and</text>
  <text start="302" dur="5.74">take us off the checks and balances so</text>
  <text start="305.13" dur="4.71">they can print and put countries into</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="5.55">debt they&amp;#39;re very patient they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="309.84" dur="5.52">rush anything but while all of this is</text>
  <text start="313.29" dur="5.34">happening and while they were making all</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="5.409">these plans things have changed xi</text>
  <text start="318.63" dur="4.629">Jinping Trump</text>
  <text start="320.769" dur="5.85">they are maneuvering right maneuvering</text>
  <text start="323.259" dur="6.33">right now to move away from the central</text>
  <text start="326.619" dur="4.711">banking establishment the central</text>
  <text start="329.589" dur="4.53">bankers know this they realize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.33" dur="6.78">coming they&amp;#39;re sending up these rainy</text>
  <text start="334.119" dur="7.92">day funds they are squandering their</text>
  <text start="338.11" dur="6.959">assets they are hiding their information</text>
  <text start="342.039" dur="6.75">and they&amp;#39;re in panic mode right now and</text>
  <text start="345.069" dur="6.39">this is going to be the last step of the</text>
  <text start="348.789" dur="5.52">complete takeover of the global economic</text>
  <text start="351.459" dur="7.11">system where they go after the central</text>
  <text start="354.309" dur="8.13">bank and they pretty much get rid of it</text>
  <text start="358.569" dur="8.041">or nationalize it in each one of these</text>
  <text start="362.439" dur="6.78">countries just like Russia did and what</text>
  <text start="366.61" dur="6.75">we&amp;#39;re watching is the deterioration of</text>
  <text start="369.219" dur="7.02">the economy I mean it&amp;#39;s not improving it</text>
  <text start="373.36" dur="6.179">has not improved since 2008 it has</text>
  <text start="376.239" dur="6.08">gotten worse and all they could do all</text>
  <text start="379.539" dur="5.701">throughout this period of time was to</text>
  <text start="382.319" dur="4.15">manipulate the data to make people think</text>
  <text start="385.24" dur="3.269">that everything was fine just like they</text>
  <text start="386.469" dur="4.8">did prior to 2008 when they said hey</text>
  <text start="388.509" dur="6.18">listen with subprime securities they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.269" dur="5.85">perfectly great investments they they</text>
  <text start="394.689" dur="4.02">are fantastic pension funds can invest</text>
  <text start="397.119" dur="5.04">in them you don&amp;#39;t have to worry they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.709" dur="5.52">triple-a but we realize now of course</text>
  <text start="402.159" dur="4.5">always after the fact they turn out to</text>
  <text start="404.229" dur="3.72">be garbage they also told us what they</text>
  <text start="406.659" dur="4.74">weren&amp;#39;t predicting a recession in the</text>
  <text start="407.949" dur="5.31">year that we had a recession they know</text>
  <text start="411.399" dur="5.04">what they&amp;#39;re doing they know how to</text>
  <text start="413.259" dur="7.08">trick the American people how to trick</text>
  <text start="416.439" dur="8.28">the population of the world that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="420.339" dur="7.56">they&amp;#39;re good at and what we are watching</text>
  <text start="424.719" dur="4.41">is everything fall apart here in the</text>
  <text start="427.899" dur="3.81">United States not just here in the</text>
  <text start="429.129" dur="5.01">United States but in Europe I mean right</text>
  <text start="431.709" dur="5.85">now real personal spending that is</text>
  <text start="434.139" dur="6.84">completely tumbling it has tumbled the</text>
  <text start="437.559" dur="6.93">most since the financial crisis and this</text>
  <text start="440.979" dur="5.7">is the 26th straight month in a row now</text>
  <text start="444.489" dur="3.66">personal spending continually declines</text>
  <text start="446.679" dur="3.84">credit card usage</text>
  <text start="448.149" dur="4.62">let&amp;#39;s continually rising now we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="450.519" dur="3.701">this pattern before this was prior to</text>
  <text start="452.769" dur="3.341">2008 now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="454.22" dur="4.26">thing is that there&amp;#39;s a certain pattern</text>
  <text start="456.11" dur="5.79">that we&amp;#39;ve seen over and over and over</text>
  <text start="458.48" dur="8.1">where consumer confidence reaches</text>
  <text start="461.9" dur="7.65">all-time highs while saving rates reach</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="5.87">all-time lows now right before the</text>
  <text start="469.55" dur="5.67">recession in 2001 we saw this spread</text>
  <text start="472.45" dur="6.73">confidence very high saving rate very</text>
  <text start="475.22" dur="5.67">low prior to 2008 we saw the same thing</text>
  <text start="479.18" dur="5.04">confidence very high consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="480.89" dur="6.99">very high saving rate very low here we</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="7.61">are today in 2018 confident consumer</text>
  <text start="487.88" dur="7.23">confidence very very high savings rate</text>
  <text start="491.83" dur="7.42">very very low this is just another</text>
  <text start="495.11" dur="7.38">indicator we also see the buying plans</text>
  <text start="499.25" dur="6.41">of Americans this is from the recent</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="7.86">conference board survey well they have</text>
  <text start="505.66" dur="7.72">declined rapidly which is another sign</text>
  <text start="510.35" dur="6.9">that another indicator showing us that</text>
  <text start="513.38" dur="5.279">things are rapidly falling apart so when</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="2.909">we start to look at all these indicators</text>
  <text start="518.659" dur="3.391">and we talked about the indicators</text>
  <text start="520.159" dur="4.261">yesterday and you start to put this up</text>
  <text start="522.05" dur="3.42">all together I mean and you go back in</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="3.96">time you start to put all these</text>
  <text start="525.47" dur="5.46">indicators together each one is showing</text>
  <text start="528.38" dur="5.37">us that we&amp;#39;re in a recession or a</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="6">recession is approaching very very</text>
  <text start="533.75" dur="5.61">quickly it&amp;#39;s not saying oh we&amp;#39;re in good</text>
  <text start="536.93" dur="4.56">times we&amp;#39;re in this incredible recovery</text>
  <text start="539.36" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t worry everything&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="541.49" dur="4.98">great when we look at these indicators</text>
  <text start="544.01" dur="4.47">we see the opposite actually happened</text>
  <text start="546.47" dur="5.22">now if we look at the LIBOR well let me</text>
  <text start="548.48" dur="5.55">explain what LIBOR is LIBOR is a</text>
  <text start="551.69" dur="4.74">benchmark rate which some of the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="554.03" dur="3.33">leading banks charge each other for</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="3.65">short-term loans</text>
  <text start="557.36" dur="6.63">it stands for intercontinental exchange</text>
  <text start="560.08" dur="5.56">London interbank offered rate and serves</text>
  <text start="563.99" dur="3.33">as the first step to calculating</text>
  <text start="565.64" dur="4.05">interest rates on various loans</text>
  <text start="567.32" dur="5.25">throughout the world so when we look at</text>
  <text start="569.69" dur="8.01">LIBOR we can see that LIBOR has been</text>
  <text start="572.57" dur="7.86">rising for 37 straight days in a row</text>
  <text start="577.7" dur="5.94">this is the longest consecutive string</text>
  <text start="580.43" dur="7.77">of advances since a 50-day streak ending</text>
  <text start="583.64" dur="8.58">in 2005 now if we focus on the LIBOR 10</text>
  <text start="588.2" dur="6.05">your curve what do we say well we see</text>
  <text start="592.22" dur="6.63">the same thing that has been happening</text>
  <text start="594.25" dur="6.37">prior to other recessions and when we go</text>
  <text start="598.85" dur="6.42">back in time if we go all the way back</text>
  <text start="600.62" dur="7.56">to 2001 we see the same thing the</text>
  <text start="605.27" dur="5.76">steepness inversion of the two year ten</text>
  <text start="608.18" dur="7.14">year as a harbinger of the next</text>
  <text start="611.03" dur="7.38">recession and it hits this point where</text>
  <text start="615.32" dur="5.85">it&amp;#39;s continually declining and we enter</text>
  <text start="618.41" dur="6.93">a recession it happened in 2001 it</text>
  <text start="621.17" dur="8.48">happened in 2007 and it is happening</text>
  <text start="625.34" dur="8.64">right now this is another indicator</text>
  <text start="629.65" dur="8.86">letting us know that something has gone</text>
  <text start="633.98" dur="6.03">very wrong and once again when we start</text>
  <text start="638.51" dur="3.54">to look at each one of these indicators</text>
  <text start="640.01" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re not showing us that the economy</text>
  <text start="642.05" dur="3.96">is improving the global economy is</text>
  <text start="643.64" dur="5.46">getting better it&amp;#39;s actually showing the</text>
  <text start="646.01" dur="7.77">opposite and what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="649.1" dur="9.24">is that with China with the US with</text>
  <text start="653.78" dur="7.86">Russia they are working together to</text>
  <text start="658.34" dur="7.98">bring down the central banking system if</text>
  <text start="661.64" dur="8.94">you notice Q has said that Facebook</text>
  <text start="666.32" dur="7.08">Google YouTube Twitter they&amp;#39;ll all be</text>
  <text start="670.58" dur="7.95">under investigation now these stocks</text>
  <text start="673.4" dur="7.53">make up the Fang and basically when</text>
  <text start="678.53" dur="4.98">those start to go down we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="680.93" dur="5.34">things happening in the stock market we</text>
  <text start="683.51" dur="6.08">see already with the tariffs with the</text>
  <text start="686.27" dur="5.49">reciprocal taxes with bilateral trades</text>
  <text start="689.59" dur="4.78">that are going on because we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="691.76" dur="5.37">rid of the TPP which was gotten rid of</text>
  <text start="694.37" dur="4.14">we see that NAFTA that&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="697.13" dur="4.14">going nowhere getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="698.51" dur="6.48">globalist framework we see that</text>
  <text start="701.27" dur="5.22">everything is being maneuvered away from</text>
  <text start="704.99" dur="3.6">the system they wanted which was a</text>
  <text start="706.49" dur="4.53">one-world government move to a</text>
  <text start="708.59" dur="4.95">completely different system because we</text>
  <text start="711.02" dur="4.38">can&amp;#39;t be on the globalist system if you</text>
  <text start="713.54" dur="4.86">bring down the central banking system it</text>
  <text start="715.4" dur="4.71">doesn&amp;#39;t work you need to get rid of all</text>
  <text start="718.4" dur="3.47">of it and remember they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="720.11" dur="5">preparing for a one-world government</text>
  <text start="721.87" dur="6.78">a globalist type of system for a very</text>
  <text start="725.11" dur="5.729">long time they were almost there but</text>
  <text start="728.65" dur="5.58">again things didn&amp;#39;t work out for it the</text>
  <text start="730.839" dur="4.711">deef state the Cabal and now everything</text>
  <text start="734.23" dur="5.01">is being maneuvered away from that this</text>
  <text start="735.55" dur="7.74">is why China has introduced the petrol</text>
  <text start="739.24" dur="7.74">you won this is like the flare up in the</text>
  <text start="743.29" dur="5.07">sky saying okay it is now time now just</text>
  <text start="746.98" dur="3.18">because they launched it on the 26th</text>
  <text start="748.36" dur="4.02">doesn&amp;#39;t mean the petrodollar collapses</text>
  <text start="750.16" dur="4.11">it means it&amp;#39;s the beginning stages just</text>
  <text start="752.38" dur="3.6">like it was the beginning stages where</text>
  <text start="754.27" dur="4.5">China had to build up their</text>
  <text start="755.98" dur="5.79">manufacturing China how to amass a huge</text>

  <text start="763.089" dur="4.711">States how to duplicate the exchanges</text>
  <text start="765.16" dur="6.39">same thing with Russia and I do believe</text>
  <text start="767.8" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re going to maneuver away from the</text>
  <text start="771.55" dur="5.49">private western central banking system</text>
  <text start="774.19" dur="4.41">that is the plan and the reason why</text>
  <text start="777.04" dur="4.02">Trump is setting up all these bilateral</text>
  <text start="778.6" dur="4.23">trades is because that is what is going</text>
  <text start="781.06" dur="5.31">to be used on the one belt one road</text>
  <text start="782.83" dur="5.07">system and we can see that this is where</text>
  <text start="786.37" dur="3.96">we are headed now the transition is</text>
  <text start="787.9" dur="5.04">coming it&amp;#39;s not about if it&amp;#39;s about when</text>
  <text start="790.33" dur="3.96">does it hit now is it going to hit one</text>
  <text start="792.94" dur="4.7">day and we say oh my god we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="794.29" dur="7.65">transition no we&amp;#39;re gonna have this slow</text>
  <text start="797.64" dur="6.19">transition moving forward if Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="801.94" dur="3.99">plan works this is what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="803.83" dur="4.92">happen now it&amp;#39;s almost like when we came</text>
  <text start="805.93" dur="3.62">off the the gold standard back in the</text>
  <text start="808.75" dur="3.209">70s</text>
  <text start="809.55" dur="4.42">everyone just didn&amp;#39;t wake up and say hey</text>
  <text start="811.959" dur="4.801">the whole thing just fell apart it was a</text>
  <text start="813.97" dur="6">slow transition you couldn&amp;#39;t get oil</text>
  <text start="816.76" dur="6.449">people couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs interest rates</text>
  <text start="819.97" dur="6.03">shot up they were creating a lot of</text>
  <text start="823.209" dur="4.441">currency the news was out there telling</text>
  <text start="826" dur="3.33">you that this is the reasons why this</text>
  <text start="827.65" dur="5.58">was all happening of course it was all</text>
  <text start="829.33" dur="7.47">completely fake phony and false and it</text>
  <text start="833.23" dur="6.06">it took a very long time to iron all of</text>
  <text start="836.8" dur="3.72">this out as we transition from the gold</text>
  <text start="839.29" dur="4.44">standard over to the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="840.52" dur="6.03">standard and again we were still the</text>
  <text start="843.73" dur="6.57">reserve currency so it wasn&amp;#39;t as bad if</text>
  <text start="846.55" dur="5.94">you go to the UK where they weren&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="850.3" dur="4.17">reserve status I mean they had like</text>
  <text start="852.49" dur="4.95">rolling blackouts they had</text>
  <text start="854.47" dur="6.24">problems people were on strike I mean it</text>
  <text start="857.44" dur="6.12">was pretty darn bad out there here a lot</text>
  <text start="860.71" dur="5.94">of people couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs things were</text>
  <text start="863.56" dur="4.2">all messed up there were gas lines this</text>
  <text start="866.65" dur="3.45">time it&amp;#39;s going to be a little bit</text>
  <text start="867.76" dur="4.56">different because as we transition away</text>
  <text start="870.1" dur="5.1">from the petrodollar system we will no</text>
  <text start="872.32" dur="4.92">longer be the reserve currency so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="875.2" dur="6.75">gonna see this transition in a different</text>
  <text start="877.24" dur="6.87">way this time where credit most likely</text>
  <text start="881.95" dur="4.89">oil and everything else is going to be a</text>
  <text start="884.11" dur="4.98">little difficult to get because once we</text>
  <text start="886.84" dur="3.78">come off the petrodollar system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="889.09" dur="3.99">going to take a little while for other</text>
  <text start="890.62" dur="5.76">things to come online where we can get</text>
  <text start="893.08" dur="5.16">the supplies we need plus credit most</text>
  <text start="896.38" dur="4.71">likely is going to come to a screeching</text>
  <text start="898.24" dur="4.23">halt as we move to a new system and a</text>
  <text start="901.09" dur="3.3">lot of things are going to be reworked</text>
  <text start="902.47" dur="5.43">and this is going to be a transition</text>
  <text start="904.39" dur="5.7">period where it&amp;#39;s going to last for</text>
  <text start="907.9" dur="4.44">probably a couple of months before</text>
  <text start="910.09" dur="3.99">everything is ironed out and of course</text>
  <text start="912.34" dur="3.06">the corporate media will make all their</text>
  <text start="914.08" dur="2.85">different stories of why this is all</text>
  <text start="915.4" dur="4.23">happening a little blame at all on Trump</text>
  <text start="916.93" dur="4.05">and things like that but eventually what</text>
  <text start="919.63" dur="3.63">will happen from everything that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="920.98" dur="5.28">trying to do right now is once it comes</text>
  <text start="923.26" dur="5.58">back online people will notice a very</text>
  <text start="926.26" dur="5.01">big difference in the way everything</text>
  <text start="928.84" dur="5.22">works now is it going to be the same</text>
  <text start="931.27" dur="5.46">type of lifestyle that we had well we</text>
  <text start="934.06" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t know as of yet but as we move</text>
  <text start="936.73" dur="3.81">forward you need to be ready because</text>
  <text start="939.13" dur="3.48">there&amp;#39;s going to be this period of time</text>
  <text start="940.54" dur="4.02">where we&amp;#39;re gonna go through this</text>
  <text start="942.61" dur="3.96">transition and for many many people who</text>
  <text start="944.56" dur="3.96">are still sleeping who are not aware of</text>
  <text start="946.57" dur="4.08">what is going on they&amp;#39;re gonna be hit</text>
  <text start="948.52" dur="4.5">very hard especially those people that</text>
  <text start="950.65" dur="4.35">are just holding dollars because the</text>
  <text start="953.02" dur="5">dollar is going to lose value very very</text>
  <text start="955" dur="7.2">quickly we already see it happening and</text>
  <text start="958.02" dur="6.67">we can see that as the troops and</text>
  <text start="962.2" dur="5.34">everything else are being removed from</text>
  <text start="964.69" dur="6.93">the Middle East and as these countries</text>
  <text start="967.54" dur="7.29">out there take over their government and</text>
  <text start="971.62" dur="6.12">make decisions on their own of what</text>
  <text start="974.83" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re going to use to sell the oil are</text>
  <text start="977.74" dur="2.46">they going to use the petro dollar are</text>
  <text start="979.09" dur="3.45">they going to use the petrol you want</text>
  <text start="980.2" dur="4.02">well most likely they&amp;#39;re gonna use the</text>
  <text start="982.54" dur="5.18">petrol you want they&amp;#39;re not gonna use</text>
  <text start="984.22" dur="3.5">the petro dollar anymore and</text>
  <text start="987.84" dur="5.1">once this starts to happen there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="990.6" dur="3.96">liquidity crisis because the dollar</text>
  <text start="992.94" dur="3.089">won&amp;#39;t be used in all these countries we</text>
  <text start="994.56" dur="3.42">already see a liquidity crisis happening</text>
  <text start="996.029" dur="2.971">in Europe right now one of these dollars</text>
  <text start="997.98" dur="4.38">are gonna float back to United States</text>
  <text start="999" dur="6.81">which is going to cause inflation so as</text>
  <text start="1002.36" dur="5.04">we move forward you need to be ready yes</text>
  <text start="1005.81" dur="3.81">you&amp;#39;re gonna need cash on hand why</text>
  <text start="1007.4" dur="3.66">because in bigness stages people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1009.62" dur="3.42">know what else to trade in and of course</text>
  <text start="1011.06" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s gonna lose value but you&amp;#39;ll need</text>
  <text start="1013.04" dur="5.7">your cash to trade you&amp;#39;ll need the cash</text>
  <text start="1016.04" dur="5.28">to purchase things eventually cash will</text>
  <text start="1018.74" dur="5.339">be worth nothing so you won&amp;#39;t use that</text>
  <text start="1021.32" dur="4.98">anymore and then the next phase since</text>
  <text start="1024.079" dur="4.771">cash is worth absolutely nothing will be</text>
  <text start="1026.3" dur="4.95">bartering listen I have toilet paper</text>

  <text start="1043.61" dur="6.36">toilet paper things like that and then</text>
  <text start="1046.37" dur="7.02">we will move past that into whatever the</text>
  <text start="1049.97" dur="5.31">sound money will be and those people</text>
  <text start="1053.39" dur="4.65">holding gold and silver cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="1055.28" dur="5.25">and things like that they will have an</text>
  <text start="1058.04" dur="4.65">insurance policy compared to those</text>
  <text start="1060.53" dur="3.02">people who have all the dollars in their</text>

  <text start="1076.09" dur="6.22">dollars in gold priced at US dollars</text>
