  <text start="121.39" dur="9.539">steady things aren&amp;#39;t improving but these</text>
  <text start="126.399" dur="6.781">numbers are just as manipulated a view</text>
  <text start="130.929" dur="4.791">as the United States numbers and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="133.18" dur="6.87">come to find out and is now confirmed</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="6.46">that these official statistics only</text>
  <text start="140.05" dur="5.519">capture people who are actively looking</text>
  <text start="142.18" dur="7.889">for work there are millions of people</text>
  <text start="145.569" dur="9.331">who would like to work if there were</text>
  <text start="150.069" dur="7.531">jobs the eurostat just reveal statistics</text>
  <text start="154.9" dur="6.18">that show a hidden army of under</text>
  <text start="157.6" dur="6.62">employed and discouraged workers they be</text>
  <text start="161.08" dur="5.82">putting in more hours if it was possible</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="4.45">what the figures reveal is how</text>
  <text start="166.9" dur="4.17">dramatically most of the eurozone is</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="5.45">failing to create enough work for its</text>
  <text start="171.07" dur="6.48">people not really surprised about this</text>
  <text start="174.12" dur="5.86">it reports that 44 million people in the</text>
  <text start="177.55" dur="5.49">EU are working part-time twenty percent</text>
  <text start="179.98" dur="4.2">of the total and more important many of</text>
  <text start="183.04" dur="3.96">them would rather be working more hours</text>
  <text start="184.18" dur="5.22">in Greece for example somebody&amp;#39;s 2% of</text>
  <text start="187" dur="4.89">part-time workers would like more hours</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="3.96">because it&amp;#39;s not enough to get by and</text>
  <text start="191.89" dur="3.66">guess what they can&amp;#39;t give them more</text>
  <text start="193.36" dur="6.14">hours actually many of these people</text>
  <text start="195.55" dur="6.48">would like to have a full-time job and</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="4.48">we&amp;#39;re seeing discourage workers and</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="3.78">those people who just can&amp;#39;t find work</text>
  <text start="203.98" dur="3.48">they love to work but they get</text>
  <text start="205.81" dur="3.78">discovered they continually look they</text>
  <text start="207.46" dur="3.33">can&amp;#39;t find anything it&amp;#39;s all the people</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="3.27">here in the United States who have</text>
  <text start="210.79" dur="3.51">fallen off the job market that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="212.86" dur="3.93">the Fed the United States government</text>
  <text start="214.3" dur="4.2">calls them here in the States outing you</text>
  <text start="216.79" dur="5.13">they call them discourage workers and</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="5.79">these people would like to have a job</text>
  <text start="221.92" dur="4.65">and what happens is every single month</text>
  <text start="224.29" dur="4.32">there are more and more of these people</text>
  <text start="226.57" dur="4.56">that fit into this category and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.61" dur="5.94">just not counted so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="231.13" dur="5.55">right now is that this entire system</text>
  <text start="234.55" dur="4.38">that they continually tell us that</text>
  <text start="236.68" dur="6.12">everything is fine everything is under</text>
  <text start="238.93" dur="5.58">control it is one gigantic manipulation</text>

  <text start="433.32" dur="3.72">be contracting I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="5.85">out there think the opposite I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="437.04" dur="6.56">know why they try to argue this point</text>
  <text start="440.31" dur="7.2">that it&amp;#39;s all online sales no it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="443.6" dur="7.27">online sales do not support the decline</text>
  <text start="447.51" dur="6.36">of the brick-and-mortar it just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.87" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s not there what&amp;#39;s happening is the</text>
  <text start="453.87" dur="7.88">people don&amp;#39;t have the funds they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="467.07" dur="5.73">to beat the client of 4.6 it was almost</text>
  <text start="469.77" dur="5.52">double of what they expected so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.8" dur="6.57">seeing stores like JC Penney Sears</text>
  <text start="475.29" dur="8.22">macy&amp;#39;s target gap old navy Tiffany and</text>
  <text start="479.37" dur="5.91">many others sales are declining and</text>
  <text start="483.51" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re going to continually decline</text>
  <text start="485.28" dur="4.83">because when we look at the economy and</text>
  <text start="488.37" dur="3.96">we look at what&amp;#39;s really going on here</text>
  <text start="490.11" dur="4.22">not the manipulation you could put the</text>
  <text start="492.33" dur="4.26">pieces together it&amp;#39;s using common sense</text>

  <text start="547.14" dur="5.01">they set up the United States is a</text>
  <text start="549.08" dur="5.44">service-oriented country it&amp;#39;s not a</text>

  <text start="591.269" dur="6.331">the worst since 2009 very interesting</text>
  <text start="595.55" dur="4.27">but they continually tell us that</text>
  <text start="597.6" dur="3.81">everything is fine the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="599.82" dur="6.209">has fallen to six hundred and five</text>
  <text start="601.41" dur="9.06">points down 13 points and we do have</text>
  <text start="606.029" dur="7.68">proof that the economy is not doing what</text>
  <text start="610.47" dur="6.77">it is doing and all we have to do is</text>
  <text start="613.709" dur="6.331">look at the tax revenue per state and</text>
  <text start="617.24" dur="4.599">what we&amp;#39;re seeing and these are the 32</text>

  <text start="630.899" dur="10.891">last year what does that tell you well</text>
  <text start="639.11" dur="6.94">people don&amp;#39;t have jobs and if they do</text>
  <text start="641.79" dur="6.83">have a job they&amp;#39;re low quality part-time</text>
  <text start="646.05" dur="9.5">work so people are making less and</text>
  <text start="648.62" dur="9.339">people are not working this is a</text>
  <text start="655.55" dur="5.71">confirmation that everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="657.959" dur="6.721">been looking at is absolutely true</text>
  <text start="661.26" dur="5.069">actually when you look at it the Obama</text>

  <text start="677.579" dur="3.45">this year do you really think that</text>
  <text start="679.41" dur="4.71">everything is just going to turn around</text>
  <text start="681.029" dur="6.391">and get better with the snap of a finger</text>
  <text start="684.12" dur="5.839">of course it isn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="687.42" dur="6.99">because we&amp;#39;ve been watching the trend</text>
  <text start="689.959" dur="6.671">it&amp;#39;s all down it&amp;#39;s all imploding and</text>
