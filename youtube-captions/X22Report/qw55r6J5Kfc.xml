  <text start="82.57" dur="5.88">political and geopolitical news now</text>
  <text start="85.3" dur="6.09">something is happening in the health</text>
  <text start="88.45" dur="6.44">care industry that is connected to</text>
  <text start="91.39" dur="6.6">Obamacare we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of people</text>
  <text start="94.89" dur="5.2">not taking obamacare and we know those</text>
  <text start="97.99" dur="3.42">numbers are continually declining and we</text>
  <text start="100.09" dur="2.94">see a lot of health care providers</text>
  <text start="101.41" dur="3.09">saying you know something this is not</text>
  <text start="103.03" dur="4.619">even worth it anymore and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="104.5" dur="4.5">getting out of the business and we see a</text>
  <text start="107.649" dur="4.86">lot of people saying you know something</text>
  <text start="109" dur="5.28">i can&amp;#39;t afford these premiums I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="112.509" dur="4.381">afford going to the doctor with these</text>
  <text start="114.28" dur="5.19">deductibles and it makes no sense for me</text>
  <text start="116.89" dur="5.19">to have the health insurance I&amp;#39;d rather</text>
  <text start="119.47" dur="5.069">take the penalty and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="122.08" dur="5.399">going for this short-term health</text>
  <text start="124.539" dur="5.151">coverage and it&amp;#39;s a lot cheaper you have</text>
  <text start="127.479" dur="8.031">a syrup for a certain period of time and</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="8.59">we can see that this is not covered by</text>
  <text start="135.51" dur="5.77">Obamacare you still have to pay the</text>
  <text start="138.28" dur="4.35">penalty but we see this is growing right</text>
  <text start="141.28" dur="2.97">now because what people are seeing is</text>
  <text start="142.63" dur="6.57">that I can get this short-term health</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="9.09">care and pay the penalty and it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="149.2" dur="7.05">cheaper than actually getting a policy</text>
  <text start="153.34" dur="5.94">from one of the insurance under</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="6.659">Obamacare because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="159.28" dur="4.95">right now is people they can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="162.909" dur="5.041">this</text>
  <text start="164.23" dur="5.49">it is very expensive and i know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.95" dur="3.81">called the Affordable Care Act but guess</text>
  <text start="169.72" dur="6.09">what people are starting to realize that</text>
  <text start="171.76" dur="6.36">it is not affordable whatsoever and this</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="5.31">whole entire thing this problem is</text>
  <text start="178.12" dur="4.77">growing now and it&amp;#39;s going to get worse</text>
  <text start="181.12" dur="3.75">as time goes on because think about it</text>
  <text start="182.89" dur="3.3">all those people that are losing their</text>
  <text start="184.87" dur="4.08">jobs all those people that are working</text>
  <text start="186.19" dur="5.67">part-time all those people who can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="188.95" dur="4.02">make ends meet they&amp;#39;re not going out and</text>
  <text start="191.86" dur="3.53">saying you know something let me spend</text>
  <text start="192.97" dur="4.799">from my family five six seven eight nine</text>
  <text start="195.39" dur="4.239">eleven hundred dollars on this health</text>
  <text start="197.769" dur="4.59">care policy a lot of people going to</text>
  <text start="199.629" dur="4.23">take the less expensive ones where up</text>
  <text start="202.359" dur="4.081">where the deductibles are much higher</text>
  <text start="203.859" dur="4.921">and they&amp;#39;re gonna be lying okay you know</text>
  <text start="206.44" dur="4.169">what I I don&amp;#39;t have enough money coming</text>
  <text start="208.78" dur="4.53">in I can&amp;#39;t even afford that I rather</text>
  <text start="210.609" dur="4.951">just take the penalty and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="5.039">to see a lot of people do this so as</text>
  <text start="215.56" dur="4.83">time goes on this is going to get worse</text>
  <text start="218.349" dur="5.101">and worse it&amp;#39;s not going to get better</text>
  <text start="220.39" dur="4.52">and actually since Obamacare was voted</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="4.259">in that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="224.91" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re seeing everything flip around and</text>
  <text start="227.709" dur="5.041">people are saying you know what I&amp;#39;m out</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="4.449">even health care providers are saying</text>
  <text start="232.75" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;m out so we see the whole thing</text>
  <text start="234.639" dur="5.551">starting to fall apart and this was not</text>
  <text start="236.62" dur="5.1">a benefit to the people basically all</text>
  <text start="240.19" dur="5.07">they did was got all the insurance</text>
  <text start="241.72" dur="5.669">companies together and say listen if we</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="4.77">all band together and we try to get</text>
  <text start="247.389" dur="4.53">everyone in we can control the premiums</text>
  <text start="250.03" dur="4.739">and continually make them go higher and</text>
  <text start="251.919" dur="4.141">higher any way to do this is to say</text>
  <text start="254.769" dur="3.511">listen if you don&amp;#39;t purchase it you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="5.429">penalized so most people will hopefully</text>
  <text start="258.28" dur="5.3">go into the health insurance but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.489" dur="5.15">seeing the opposite happened right now</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="5.769">we see that 400 people were protesting</text>
  <text start="266.639" dur="5.261">the role of big money in politics</text>
  <text start="269.349" dur="5.701">outside the US Capitol and they were</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="5.28">arrested they were nonviolent it was</text>
  <text start="275.05" dur="5.7">organized by the advocacy group</text>
  <text start="277.18" dur="6.269">democracy spring and the police came in</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="5.729">and they arrested them for unlawful</text>
  <text start="283.449" dur="7.011">demonstration activity charge him with</text>
  <text start="286.479" dur="6.75">crowding obstructing and assembling in</text>
  <text start="290.46" dur="5.32">this area now I thought the First</text>
  <text start="293.229" dur="4.351">Amendment allowed people to peaceably to</text>
  <text start="295.78" dur="5.52">assemble and to petition</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="5.94">in the government so let&amp;#39;s read the</text>
  <text start="301.3" dur="3.63">first amendment again Congress shall</text>
  <text start="303.52" dur="3.54">make no law respecting an establishment</text>
  <text start="304.93" dur="4.38">of religion or prohibiting the free</text>
  <text start="307.06" dur="4.859">exercise thereof or abridging the</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="4.44">freedom of speech or of the press or the</text>
  <text start="311.919" dur="4.05">right of the people peaceably to</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="8.759">assemble and to petition the government</text>
  <text start="315.969" dur="8.73">for a redress of grievances so right</text>
  <text start="322.509" dur="6.87">here the First Amendment says Congress</text>
  <text start="324.699" dur="8.22">shall make no law which will block any</text>
  <text start="329.379" dur="8.72">of these things so the police came in</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="11.28">and arrested the people for crowding</text>
  <text start="338.099" dur="8.41">obstructing assembling in an area well</text>
  <text start="344.199" dur="7.141">there are no laws above the First</text>
  <text start="346.509" dur="7.47">Amendment so what do we have here we</text>
  <text start="351.34" dur="7.259">have a government that again once again</text>
  <text start="353.979" dur="7.41">is not looking at our rights not</text>
  <text start="358.599" dur="6.68">following the Constitution and just</text>
  <text start="361.389" dur="7.321">going out and doing whatever they want</text>
  <text start="365.279" dur="4.6">we see a new report out there and this</text>
  <text start="368.71" dur="4.139">is coming from Princeton and</text>
  <text start="369.879" dur="6.981">Northwestern University it has concluded</text>
  <text start="372.849" dur="7.47">that the u.s. is now in Oleg our key and</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="5.26">it has the the people in charge they</text>
  <text start="380.319" dur="6">have no interest in the welfare of its</text>
  <text start="382.12" dur="7.53">own people so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="386.319" dur="4.951">now is the US political system is geared</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="5.4">towards serving the interest of special</text>
  <text start="391.27" dur="6.989">interest groups and organization and the</text>
  <text start="395.05" dur="5.22">definition of oligarchy is a country</text>
  <text start="398.259" dur="9.601">business that is controlled by a small</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="12.139">group of people and we can see where we</text>
  <text start="407.86" dur="7.2">are today Congress the president</text>
  <text start="412.409" dur="5.35">everything they&amp;#39;ve done is not for the</text>
  <text start="415.06" dur="5.52">people everything that they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="417.759" dur="5.46">not for the people everything that</text>
  <text start="420.58" dur="5.929">they&amp;#39;re doing is for themselves foreign</text>
  <text start="423.219" dur="6.151">governments central banks corporations</text>
  <text start="426.509" dur="4.931">this tells us they broke the contract</text>
  <text start="429.37" dur="6.3">with we the people</text>
  <text start="431.44" dur="9.39">that tells us that these people need to</text>
  <text start="435.67" dur="7.29">be removed at this point because this is</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="7.07">not a democracy anymore it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="442.96" dur="7.68">oligarchy and once you have a nola Garqi</text>
  <text start="447.9" dur="5.2">you have this ruling class that thinks</text>
  <text start="450.64" dur="4.89">everyone below them will do whatever</text>
  <text start="453.1" dur="6.36">they want and there are separate laws</text>
  <text start="455.53" dur="8.22">for us and separate laws for you and we</text>
  <text start="459.46" dur="7.11">are already seeing this we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="463.75" dur="5.25">government say you know something we</text>
  <text start="466.57" dur="4.65">pass this law you have to abide by it</text>
  <text start="469" dur="5.52">and we&amp;#39;re going to exempt ourselves from</text>
  <text start="471.22" dur="4.74">Obamacare we&amp;#39;re not going to follow the</text>
  <text start="474.52" dur="4.05">Constitution we&amp;#39;re not going to allow</text>

  <text start="512.44" dur="6.63">what they fought for they fought against</text>

  <text start="684.67" dur="6.959">step down now out in Europe we see that</text>
  <text start="688.329" dur="6.18">the u.s. is planning the largest</text>
  <text start="691.629" dur="5.731">increase of their military presence in</text>
  <text start="694.509" dur="3.871">Eastern Europe since the Cold War and we</text>
  <text start="697.36" dur="2.82">see that</text>
  <text start="698.38" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re bringing in a lot of military</text>
  <text start="700.18" dur="5.25">assets a lot of US troops into Europe</text>
  <text start="702.88" dur="7.26">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="705.43" dur="8.13">about three brigades of troops coming</text>
  <text start="710.14" dur="5.07">into this area and it seems that the US</text>
  <text start="713.56" dur="4.68">troops in Europe is going to outnumber</text>
  <text start="715.21" dur="6.12">all European troops combined at this</text>
  <text start="718.24" dur="6.56">point and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before during</text>
  <text start="721.33" dur="6.6">Roman times where Rome the Roman Empire</text>
  <text start="724.8" dur="5.83">use military Garrison&amp;#39;s to contain local</text>
  <text start="727.93" dur="6.51">population just in case they rebelled</text>
  <text start="730.63" dur="5.49">against the government of Rome and what</text>
  <text start="734.44" dur="3.54">happens if one of the countries in</text>
  <text start="736.12" dur="4.32">Europe decides you know what we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="737.98" dur="4.59">enough and we&amp;#39;re going to stop the</text>

  <text start="748.18" dur="6.96">to be stopped so we&amp;#39;re starting to see a</text>
  <text start="752.23" dur="5.76">lot of similarities happening that once</text>
  <text start="755.14" dur="6.06">happened back in Roman times now out in</text>
  <text start="757.99" dur="7.55">Yemen we are seeing there is a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="761.2" dur="8.13">it was effective on april eleventh and</text>
  <text start="765.54" dur="5.62">we realize that saudi arabia which is</text>
  <text start="769.33" dur="3.72">the proxy army for the united states</text>
  <text start="771.16" dur="4.02">government they&amp;#39;ve been trying to push</text>
  <text start="773.05" dur="3.6">the who thiis out of the country they</text>
  <text start="775.18" dur="4.56">want the puppet government back in there</text>
  <text start="776.65" dur="4.26">and we realized that Yemen doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="779.74" dur="2.13">really have that much oil at least</text>
  <text start="780.91" dur="2.76">that&amp;#39;s what the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="781.87" dur="4.17">continually telling us that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="783.67" dur="6.29">have that much oil that you know this is</text>
  <text start="786.04" dur="8.31">not really a big deal in this area but</text>
  <text start="789.96" dur="8.88">when we look we notice something that</text>
  <text start="794.35" dur="10.91">the media is not telling us that Yemen</text>
  <text start="798.84" dur="12.7">does have a lot of oil it is sitting on</text>
  <text start="805.26" dur="9.33">a huge amount and it is situated in a</text>
  <text start="811.54" dur="7.11">shared region of the Red Sea and</text>
  <text start="814.59" dur="5.56">offshore in the sea of Aden it should</text>
  <text start="818.65" dur="3.42">come as no surprise that companies like</text>
  <text start="820.15" dur="4.83">British Gas and even the United States</text>
  <text start="822.07" dur="7.14">Geological Survey have been fully aware</text>
  <text start="824.98" dur="6.9">of this oil and gas deposits on the</text>
  <text start="829.21" dur="5.87">shores of Yemen for some time now</text>
  <text start="831.88" dur="6.33">the USGS report from 2002 shows an</text>
  <text start="835.08" dur="4.99">immeasurable potential while numerous</text>
  <text start="838.21" dur="6.9">survey is an exploration offshore show</text>
  <text start="840.07" dur="12.24">vast reservoirs so we understand at this</text>
  <text start="845.11" dur="10.8">point why the u.s. Saudi Arabia need to</text>
  <text start="852.31" dur="5.73">capture Yemen once again and put in a</text>
  <text start="855.91" dur="4.65">puppet government because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="858.04" dur="3.84">looking at this saying okay Yemen does</text>
  <text start="860.56" dur="2.76">have a lot of oil but the corporate</text>
  <text start="861.88" dur="3.63">media is out there trying to convince</text>
  <text start="863.32" dur="4.32">everyone saying yeah Yemen really</text>
  <text start="865.51" dur="3.68">doesn&amp;#39;t have that much it&amp;#39;s not a big</text>
  <text start="867.64" dur="4.26">deal but we&amp;#39;re seeing the actual</text>
  <text start="869.19" dur="5.83">opposite at this point now we know that</text>
  <text start="871.9" dur="6.15">the US and NATO they are preparing and</text>
  <text start="875.02" dur="4.68">getting ready to go into Libya we know</text>
  <text start="878.05" dur="3.53">there&amp;#39;s a buildup of American British</text>
  <text start="879.7" dur="5">French and Italian agents and officers</text>
  <text start="881.58" dur="7.87">with reconnaissance and armed drones</text>
  <text start="884.7" dur="6.39">flying out of bases in Sicily they&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="915.01" dur="7.65">working alongside the Italian forces and</text>
  <text start="920.13" dur="5.89">we see at this point that it&amp;#39;s a matter</text>
  <text start="922.66" dur="5.49">of time before this happens now of</text>
  <text start="926.02" dur="4.71">course as we know they wanted to get the</text>
