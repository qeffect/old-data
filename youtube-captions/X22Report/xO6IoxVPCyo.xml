  <text start="53.27" dur="6.47">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="56.81" dur="6.69">report my name is Dave in this episode</text>
  <text start="59.74" dur="6.37">1573 a and today&amp;#39;s date is May 21st 2018</text>
  <text start="63.5" dur="6.69">and out of the episode is the economic</text>
  <text start="66.11" dur="6.21">system is breaking down worldwide let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.19" dur="4.289">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.32" dur="3.84">news now we&amp;#39;ve been talking about crypto</text>
  <text start="74.479" dur="4.351">currency the blockchain for quite a</text>
  <text start="76.16" dur="6.18">while and we can see that the central</text>
  <text start="78.83" dur="6.649">bankers the Fed the IMF all the central</text>
  <text start="82.34" dur="5.82">banking institutions they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="85.479" dur="6.431">into this crypto market the blockchain</text>
  <text start="88.16" dur="5.489">because basically it overrides their</text>
  <text start="91.91" dur="3.09">system and they know this this is why</text>
  <text start="93.649" dur="3.271">they&amp;#39;ve been demonizing it this is why</text>
  <text start="95" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing it out there saying</text>
  <text start="96.92" dur="4.89">that you know terrorists use it and this</text>
  <text start="98.99" dur="6.39">is all debunked China did a report on it</text>
  <text start="101.81" dur="5.97">actually in Florida in one of the</text>
  <text start="105.38" dur="3.9">counties they are using crypto</text>
  <text start="107.78" dur="2.699">currencies to pay for taxes and they</text>
  <text start="109.28" dur="3.78">said the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="110.479" dur="4.5">is because it cuts down on fraud and</text>
  <text start="113.06" dur="4.08">things like that because the blockchain</text>
  <text start="114.979" dur="4.791">is a ledger system and it&amp;#39;s a truth</text>
  <text start="117.14" dur="4.649">machine and we see that there are many</text>
  <text start="119.77" dur="5.14">companies out there that are moving</text>
  <text start="121.789" dur="5.61">towards blockchain technology and</text>
  <text start="124.91" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re going to be accepting crypto</text>
  <text start="127.399" dur="5.761">currencies PayPal said they will</text>
  <text start="130.22" dur="5.61">certainly support crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="133.16" dur="4.43">they&amp;#39;re waiting for the volatility to</text>
  <text start="135.83" dur="4.23">cease and they&amp;#39;re waiting for it to be</text>
  <text start="137.59" dur="5.02">stabilized and eventually what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="140.06" dur="5.1">to happen is that this will happen the</text>
  <text start="142.61" dur="5.4">other reason it&amp;#39;s volatile right now is</text>
  <text start="145.16" dur="4.409">because what the central banks and what</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="4.35">certain individuals are doing where</text>
  <text start="149.569" dur="4.981">they&amp;#39;re dumping a huge amount of crypto</text>
  <text start="152.36" dur="5.15">currencies eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="154.55" dur="7.29">happen is that this will all be</text>
  <text start="157.51" dur="7.48">stabilized and we can see that there are</text>
  <text start="161.84" dur="7.35">many companies out there that are moving</text>
  <text start="164.99" dur="6.39">towards this technology square cash for</text>

  <text start="182.15" dur="4.5">interesting is that they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="7.739">growing faster than PayPal</text>
  <text start="186.65" dur="10.919">venmo mobile payment service and we know</text>
  <text start="191.629" dur="7.771">the CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey he</text>

  <text start="281.96" dur="5.34">you don&amp;#39;t need any type of transaction</text>
  <text start="284.51" dur="4.98">through a centralized system you don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="299.09" dur="5.88">it 24 hours seven days a week</text>
  <text start="302.3" dur="3.839">no matter what and there are companies</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="5.1">out there that are working on</text>
  <text start="306.139" dur="6.84">transactions and they are lightning fast</text>
  <text start="310.07" dur="4.649">I mean it&amp;#39;s so much faster than it is</text>
  <text start="312.979" dur="3.93">right now and it&amp;#39;s pretty darn fast</text>
  <text start="314.719" dur="5.07">right now but it&amp;#39;s gonna blow everything</text>
  <text start="316.909" dur="3.48">out of the water and once we have atomic</text>
  <text start="319.789" dur="3.271">swap</text>
  <text start="320.389" dur="5.071">once we have decentralized exchanges</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="5.06">forget about it the central banks are</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="5.759">doing we don&amp;#39;t need a centralization</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="5.41">system where there&amp;#39;s a private</text>
  <text start="331.219" dur="5.281">corporation handling everything and</text>
  <text start="333.53" dur="5.97">telling us what to do and loaning us and</text>
  <text start="336.5" dur="5.159">this is the biggest part loaning us this</text>
  <text start="339.5" dur="4.74">currency with interest attached we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="341.659" dur="5.551">need to be loan currency that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.24" dur="6.419">ridiculous that&amp;#39;s an old obsolete system</text>
  <text start="347.21" dur="4.56">that the central bankers created to take</text>
  <text start="350.659" dur="3.48">control of the world</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s really what they did and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="354.139" dur="4.68">need them anymore and they know this</text>
  <text start="356.15" dur="5.639">this is what they&amp;#39;re so afraid of</text>
  <text start="358.819" dur="6.241">now as the economy continually declines</text>
  <text start="361.789" dur="6.69">and everything falls apart they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="365.06" dur="5.729">be ramping up the demonization against</text>
  <text start="368.479" dur="4.56">cryptocurrency because they know as the</text>
  <text start="370.789" dur="4.141">economy falls apart people are gonna say</text>
  <text start="373.039" dur="4.951">well wait a minute why is this happening</text>
  <text start="374.93" dur="5.07">and if the fingers and um hopefully they</text>
  <text start="377.99" dur="3.329">will all be pointed towards the central</text>
  <text start="380" dur="3.419">bank once they are pointed toward the</text>
  <text start="381.319" dur="3.72">central bank and maybe the auto bill</text>
  <text start="383.419" dur="3.421">does go through and the president does</text>
  <text start="385.039" dur="3.151">sign it and then we find out what they</text>
  <text start="386.84" dur="3.66">were really up to because we know</text>
  <text start="388.19" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ve been up to a lot that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="390.5" dur="3.479">know about I mean we can make out some</text>
  <text start="392.27" dur="4.56">of what they&amp;#39;ve been up to with all this</text>
  <text start="393.979" dur="4.68">quantitative easing and shuffling the</text>
  <text start="396.83" dur="3.44">funds around the world and money</text>
  <text start="398.659" dur="4.891">laundering and all this other stuff</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="6.69">filling their coffers with real estate</text>
  <text start="403.55" dur="6.75">and everything else they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="406.96" dur="5.709">paper money that&amp;#39;s worthless they know</text>
  <text start="410.3" dur="4.589">this what they do is they put countries</text>
  <text start="412.669" dur="5.161">into debt and they come in all the</text>
  <text start="414.889" dur="5.28">investors and they buy all this up for</text>
  <text start="417.83" dur="5.399">pennies on the dollar and they get hard</text>
  <text start="420.169" dur="4.59">assets and once they realize that things</text>
  <text start="423.229" dur="3.541">are rapidly falling apart you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="424.759" dur="4.681">see the demonization just go from a</text>
  <text start="426.77" dur="5.25">scale from one to all the way up to ten</text>
