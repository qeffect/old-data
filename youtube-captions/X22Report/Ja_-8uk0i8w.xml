  <text start="96.619" dur="4.86">euro but they&amp;#39;re moving away from the</text>
  <text start="99.02" dur="5.7">dollar because they understand first of</text>
  <text start="101.479" dur="6.411">all the deep state can sanction them</text>
  <text start="104.72" dur="6.509">through the central banking system and</text>

  <text start="138.59" dur="3.33">example if we look at Argentina we see</text>
  <text start="140.72" dur="2.43">it there they don&amp;#39;t have sanctions it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="5.099">just that their country is a complete</text>
  <text start="143.15" dur="6.03">mess we see out in Iran Syria Russia</text>
  <text start="147.019" dur="5.431">China you name it wherever there are</text>
  <text start="149.18" dur="6.54">sanctions you can see that there are</text>
  <text start="152.45" dur="5.31">problems and a lot of these countries</text>
  <text start="155.72" dur="3.78">have decided you know something we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="157.76" dur="4.11">going to move away now Russia and China</text>
  <text start="159.5" dur="4.769">they created the BRICS they created the</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="6.66">separate payment system apart from the</text>
  <text start="164.269" dur="7.621">Swift and they are buying as much gold</text>
  <text start="168.53" dur="5.76">as possible Russia is looking into</text>
  <text start="171.89" dur="5.76">crypto currencies many of the other</text>
  <text start="174.29" dur="5.31">countries they have been moving either</text>
  <text start="177.65" dur="3.3">towards cryptocurrency or away from</text>
  <text start="179.6" dur="3.419">cryptocurrencies those with private</text>
  <text start="180.95" dur="3.42">western central banks they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="183.019" dur="3.241">want to have anything to do with crypto</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="2.199">currencies because that is the order of</text>
  <text start="186.26" dur="2.349">the</text>
  <text start="186.569" dur="3.631">central bank do not look at gold or</text>
  <text start="188.609" dur="5.421">silver do not look at cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="190.2" dur="7.59">only look at our paper money that is it</text>
  <text start="194.03" dur="7.78">but we can see right now in Iran those</text>
  <text start="197.79" dur="7.589">people who are nervous and afraid and we</text>
  <text start="201.81" dur="4.98">know that the rial is crashing right now</text>
  <text start="205.379" dur="5.61">because of all the sanctions and things</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="7.94">like that they are taking their wealth</text>
  <text start="210.989" dur="6.271">and putting it into cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="214.73" dur="6.369">because it is a shield against</text>
  <text start="217.26" dur="6.089">hyperinflation and they&amp;#39;re able to get</text>
  <text start="221.099" dur="7.89">their funds out of the country now I</text>
  <text start="223.349" dur="7.98">mention this in a few reports back where</text>
  <text start="228.989" dur="4.65">I said if there is a financial crisis</text>
  <text start="231.329" dur="5.791">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this done in other</text>
  <text start="233.639" dur="5.55">countries because what happens is when</text>
  <text start="237.12" dur="5.789">there is a financial crisis the central</text>
  <text start="239.189" dur="5.491">banking system the government&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="242.909" dur="3.991">lock everything down they say yes you</text>
  <text start="244.68" dur="4.32">can transfer from bank to bank but you</text>
  <text start="246.9" dur="4.5">can&amp;#39;t take cash out they definitely</text>
  <text start="249" dur="5.579">don&amp;#39;t want you taking cash out of the</text>
  <text start="251.4" dur="4.889">system the thing is with crypto</text>
  <text start="254.579" dur="4.83">currencies right now which is really not</text>
  <text start="256.289" dur="6.301">part of any banking system this is a way</text>
  <text start="259.409" dur="5.01">to get your funds and this way hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="5.37">been around for a very long time it is a</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="5.881">way electronically to get your funds out</text>
  <text start="267.96" dur="2.639">of the banking system with the push of a</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="3.72">button</text>
  <text start="270.599" dur="5.82">and boom you&amp;#39;re done you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="4.26">run down to the ATM you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="276.419" dur="4.021">take your currency out and then go</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="6.12">purchase gold or make a purchase into</text>
  <text start="280.44" dur="7.65">gold you can just hit a button and then</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="7.949">boom it&amp;#39;s someplace else outside of the</text>
  <text start="288.09" dur="7.71">banking system and once again crypto</text>
  <text start="292.349" dur="8.011">currencies they don&amp;#39;t have borders it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="7.32">universal just like gold pretty much the</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="5.6">same thing crypto currencies is really</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="6.69">like the electronic version of that and</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="7.75">this is why central bankers do not like</text>
  <text start="309.81" dur="5.96">it at all and we can see right now out</text>
  <text start="313.71" dur="5.19">in Iran this is what people are doing</text>
  <text start="315.77" dur="4.57">they are taking their wealth and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.9" dur="5.489">moving it into crypto</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="8.13">currencies and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="324.389" dur="5.461">about all this is that we mentioned that</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="4.14">there are certain states there are</text>
  <text start="329.85" dur="5.48">certain counties that are allowing you</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="5.25">or passing laws allowing you to pay</text>
  <text start="335.33" dur="5.98">using crypto currencies to pay off your</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="7.8">taxes we see stores are starting to</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="7.95">accept crypto currencies and as we move</text>
  <text start="345.66" dur="7.05">forward we&amp;#39;re going to see more of this</text>
  <text start="349.26" dur="6.06">why because this is going to be the new</text>
  <text start="352.71" dur="5.459">currency I mean Steve Wozniak the</text>
  <text start="355.32" dur="5.46">co-founder of Apple the guy that</text>
  <text start="358.169" dur="6.931">actually created the personal computer</text>
  <text start="360.78" dur="6.99">and he was giving a speech in Vienna</text>
  <text start="365.1" dur="6.39">Austria - we are developers World</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="6.6">Congress 2018 and in his opening speech</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="7.17">he decided to mention blockchain</text>
  <text start="374.37" dur="8.43">technology and he said blockchain is the</text>
  <text start="378.66" dur="7.83">next major IT revolution that is about</text>
  <text start="382.8" dur="6.36">to happen and he explained that the</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="4.32">outlook on blockchain by the fact that</text>
  <text start="389.16" dur="3.75">there are many useful application for</text>
  <text start="390.81" dur="6.32">the technology in a number of areas is</text>
  <text start="392.91" dur="9.12">going to be the next up incoming IT</text>
  <text start="397.13" dur="7.87">revolution he says crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="402.03" dur="5.73">will achieve full potential in ten years</text>
  <text start="405" dur="5.18">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s going to start in</text>
  <text start="407.76" dur="6.33">ten years it&amp;#39;s going to hit its full</text>
  <text start="410.18" dur="5.799">potential so during this period just</text>
  <text start="414.09" dur="6.6">like the internet the internet was</text>
  <text start="415.979" dur="6.991">started but it hit its potential maybe</text>
  <text start="420.69" dur="5.25">eight five years later but during that</text>
  <text start="422.97" dur="6">period of time everyone was getting on</text>
  <text start="425.94" dur="7.68">board the same thing is happening right</text>
  <text start="428.97" dur="8.55">now and he&amp;#39;s saying that this is going</text>
  <text start="433.62" dur="9.45">to be the next pretty much currency</text>
  <text start="437.52" dur="8.25">system now he sold all his bitcoins he</text>
  <text start="443.07" dur="5.159">says he&amp;#39;s not an investor he didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="445.77" dur="3.78">to watch the prices go up and down when</text>
  <text start="448.229" dur="4.021">pretty much when everything is stay</text>
  <text start="449.55" dur="4.6">stabilized and you know it is the</text>
  <text start="452.25" dur="4.32">technology that everyone</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="6.78">is using guess what he&amp;#39;ll be back in</text>
  <text start="456.57" dur="7.56">he&amp;#39;s kept one Bitcoin that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.93" dur="5.37">kept right now and I believe that</text>
  <text start="464.13" dur="6.46">eventually he&amp;#39;s going to be purchasing a</text>
  <text start="466.3" dur="6.12">lot more and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="470.59" dur="6.6">there are many investors there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="472.42" dur="6.75">elite that are taking their wealth and</text>
  <text start="477.19" dur="5.07">they are moving it into cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="479.17" dur="5.82">and keeping it in a vault they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="482.26" dur="4.2">this for a reason people are doing this</text>
  <text start="484.99" dur="3.6">for a reason because they understand</text>
  <text start="486.46" dur="6.87">that this banking system the central</text>
  <text start="488.59" dur="7.53">banking system it&amp;#39;s corrupt it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="493.33" dur="6.72">serve the people it serves the central</text>
  <text start="496.12" dur="6.81">bankers and we see already that banks</text>
  <text start="500.05" dur="6.21">well they do underhanded things I mean</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="7.86">look at Wells Fargo I mean they were</text>
  <text start="506.26" dur="7.59">caught up in pushing customers into</text>
  <text start="510.79" dur="7.73">higher fee retirement accounts and they</text>
  <text start="513.85" dur="7.85">got caught and they&amp;#39;re caught again</text>
  <text start="518.52" dur="5.44">Wells Fargo&amp;#39;s business banking</text>
  <text start="521.7" dur="5.05">improperly altered information on</text>
  <text start="523.96" dur="5.07">documents related to corporate customers</text>
  <text start="526.75" dur="5.37">without their knowledge the information</text>
  <text start="529.03" dur="4.59">adjusted by Wells Fargo employees varied</text>
  <text start="532.12" dur="4.23">from Social Security numbers to</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="5">addresses to dates of birth for people</text>
  <text start="536.35" dur="5.61">associated with business banking clients</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="5.32">now this is amazing because they were</text>
  <text start="541.96" dur="4.26">getting their paperwork and get</text>
  <text start="543.94" dur="4.32">everything together to meet a deadline</text>
  <text start="546.22" dur="3.45">to comply with regulatory consent order</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="4.14">related to the bank&amp;#39;s anti-money</text>
  <text start="549.67" dur="4.26">laundering controls so in other words to</text>
  <text start="552.4" dur="3.78">comply with regulations against</text>
  <text start="553.93" dur="4.44">fabricating client data they fabricated</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="5.67">client data I mean think about what is</text>
  <text start="558.37" dur="5.97">happening here the banking system is</text>
  <text start="561.85" dur="4.35">completely corrupt the central banking</text>
  <text start="564.34" dur="3.27">system is completely corrupt it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="566.2" dur="4.37">part of the government they&amp;#39;re not for</text>
  <text start="567.61" dur="5.82">the people it&amp;#39;s a private corporation</text>
  <text start="570.57" dur="4.81">they deal in profit they deal in debt</text>
  <text start="573.43" dur="5.48">they&amp;#39;re not looking out for the best</text>
  <text start="575.38" dur="7.17">interests of the economy of the world</text>
  <text start="578.91" dur="6.43">they never were their system is only</text>
  <text start="582.55" dur="5.3">designed to last 40 to 45 years then it</text>
  <text start="585.34" dur="5.01">collapses this is why they have a van</text>
  <text start="587.85" dur="6.88">every single time and we move to a new</text>
  <text start="590.35" dur="7.62">system and they do this over and over</text>
  <text start="594.73" dur="4.829">and over again I mean 1971 we moved to a</text>
  <text start="597.97" dur="3.299">new system because the central bankers</text>
  <text start="599.559" dur="3.39">they couldn&amp;#39;t create currency because we</text>
  <text start="601.269" dur="3.69">were hooked to the gold standard how do</text>
  <text start="602.949" dur="5.341">you create more currency and take</text>
  <text start="604.959" dur="7.141">control of more of the take control more</text>
  <text start="608.29" dur="7.109">of the economy you get off the gold</text>
  <text start="612.1" dur="4.589">standard the checks and balances this is</text>
  <text start="615.399" dur="3.42">why they came up with this ridiculous</text>
  <text start="616.689" dur="4.471">story of gold speculators we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="618.819" dur="5.31">temporary come off of the gold standard</text>
  <text start="621.16" dur="6.69">for 4045 years that&amp;#39;s what they did</text>
  <text start="624.129" dur="7.74">that&amp;#39;s a very long temporary period of</text>
  <text start="627.85" dur="6.989">time which means they lied they always</text>
  <text start="631.869" dur="5.76">end up lying it sounds great they really</text>
  <text start="634.839" dur="5">think very hard about their stories they</text>
  <text start="637.629" dur="5.01">back it up and they make you believe</text>
  <text start="639.839" dur="4.54">that they&amp;#39;re doing it for your best</text>
  <text start="642.639" dur="4.711">interest but really they&amp;#39;re doing it for</text>
  <text start="644.379" dur="5.341">themselves the economy is breaking down</text>
  <text start="647.35" dur="5.25">right now and we are seeing indicator</text>
  <text start="649.72" dur="6.44">after indicator showing us that things</text>

  <text start="676.689" dur="6.661">low but when you look at the continuous</text>
  <text start="679.6" dur="8.429">jobless claims every time they hit a low</text>
  <text start="683.35" dur="9.02">point we go into a recession I mean just</text>

  <text start="872.68" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re gonna use something completely</text>
  <text start="875.38" dur="4.92">different maybe something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="876.4" dur="6.83">decentralized and we can see in all</text>
  <text start="880.3" dur="5.88">different countries and governments in</text>
  <text start="883.23" dur="5.47">corporations they&amp;#39;re starting to move to</text>
  <text start="886.18" dur="5.46">cryptocurrencies it&amp;#39;s very easy to go</text>
  <text start="888.7" dur="6.36">into this we already have the internet</text>
  <text start="891.64" dur="5.67">we already have the electronic payment</text>
  <text start="895.06" dur="3.78">system we know how to use it I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="897.31" dur="3.24">talking one that&amp;#39;s connected to this to</text>
  <text start="898.84" dur="3.96">the banking system I&amp;#39;m saying people</text>
  <text start="900.55" dur="4.77">know how to go into a store use their</text>
  <text start="902.8" dur="5.75">phone use their credit card and pay</text>
  <text start="905.32" dur="5.25">electronically they know I had a bank</text>
  <text start="908.55" dur="4.06">electronically I hate to say</text>
  <text start="910.57" dur="4.98">cryptocurrencies really not that big of</text>
  <text start="912.61" dur="4.35">a difference I mean everyone goes oh I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="915.55" dur="4.05">so confused it really isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="916.96" dur="4.46">confusing you have a bank account number</text>
  <text start="919.6" dur="5.04">think of it as an address</text>
  <text start="921.42" dur="7.12">guess what crypto currencies has an</text>
  <text start="924.64" dur="7.86">address or a bank account number that</text>
  <text start="928.54" dur="6.93">you use people take your number and they</text>
  <text start="932.5" dur="6.12">send you the funds you take their number</text>
  <text start="935.47" dur="6.96">and they send you the funds you have a</text>
  <text start="938.62" dur="6.84">secret number oh that&amp;#39;s like your bank</text>
  <text start="942.43" dur="6.62">PIN number so if you really think about</text>
  <text start="945.46" dur="7.37">it there&amp;#39;s not that big of a difference</text>
  <text start="949.05" dur="6.28">people make it bigger than it really is</text>
  <text start="952.83" dur="5.98">we already know how to do all this stuff</text>
  <text start="955.33" dur="7.65">and going forward this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="958.81" dur="7.56">very easy switch it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="962.98" dur="6.18">that hard and people are gonna start to</text>
  <text start="966.37" dur="5.31">realize hey I don&amp;#39;t need the banking</text>
  <text start="969.16" dur="5.88">system I can use this new currency</text>
  <text start="971.68" dur="6.27">without the bank I can purchase gold I</text>
  <text start="975.04" dur="5.97">can purchase products I can send money</text>
  <text start="977.95" dur="5.46">to people there&amp;#39;s no reason to pay taxes</text>
  <text start="981.01" dur="4.59">on it because the central bank has</text>
  <text start="983.41" dur="5.13">nothing to do with this it&amp;#39;s not created</text>
  <text start="985.6" dur="3.489">with interest attached that&amp;#39;s the most</text>
  <text start="988.54" dur="4.959">in</text>
  <text start="989.089" dur="8.82">and part of it and it&amp;#39;s a truth machine</text>
  <text start="993.499" dur="8.46">remember this is outside the system so</text>
  <text start="997.909" dur="6.48">if governments want to seize assets like</text>
  <text start="1001.959" dur="4.8">physical gold well they can find that</text>
  <text start="1004.389" dur="4.74">and they can take it if they wanted to</text>
  <text start="1006.759" dur="4.47">take land they can take that because</text>
  <text start="1009.129" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s within their jurisdiction it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="1011.229" dur="5.94">their country crypto currencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1014.769" dur="6.24">decentralized they&amp;#39;re not in one</text>
  <text start="1017.169" dur="5.48">location and soon the exchanges are</text>
  <text start="1021.009" dur="3.65">going to be decentralized</text>
  <text start="1022.649" dur="4.42">they&amp;#39;re not going to be in one location</text>
  <text start="1024.659" dur="6.25">it&amp;#39;s not like oh they&amp;#39;re sitting here in</text>
  <text start="1027.069" dur="8.661">the u.s. they&amp;#39;re sitting everywhere so</text>
  <text start="1030.909" dur="7.65">how do you seize the assets very</text>
  <text start="1035.73" dur="7.51">difficult to do so especially if you</text>
  <text start="1038.559" dur="6.06">have at an offline wallet and people are</text>
  <text start="1043.24" dur="3.809">starting to realize this in other</text>
  <text start="1044.619" dur="5.88">countries they&amp;#39;re already realizing that</text>
  <text start="1047.049" dur="6.99">hey I&amp;#39;m outside of the system I can</text>
  <text start="1050.499" dur="5.28">protect myself and many people are going</text>
  <text start="1054.039" dur="3.12">to start to realize this and this is</text>
  <text start="1055.779" dur="3.9">what the central bank is very worried</text>
  <text start="1057.159" dur="4.561">about and this is the biggest thing here</text>
  <text start="1059.679" dur="5.57">and I&amp;#39;m not saying you shouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1061.72" dur="6.62">gold or silver that protects your wealth</text>
  <text start="1065.249" dur="8.13">crypto currencies protects your wealth</text>
  <text start="1068.34" dur="8.589">both of them together double protection</text>
  <text start="1073.379" dur="6.851">so we are moving to a new currency and</text>
  <text start="1076.929" dur="5.13">the people are going to drive this</text>
