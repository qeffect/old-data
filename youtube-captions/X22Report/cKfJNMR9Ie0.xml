  <text start="49.12" dur="6.24">and following this economy and since</text>
  <text start="52.059" dur="5.971">2008 the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="55.36" dur="5.58">have been pushing the idea that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="58.03" dur="5.76">making this a lot better but we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="60.94" dur="5.37">finding out that no it&amp;#39;s actually the</text>
  <text start="63.79" dur="5.34">opposite they&amp;#39;ve been creating bubbles</text>
  <text start="66.31" dur="4.59">and making the economy even worse and</text>
  <text start="69.13" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;re getting more and more proof of</text>
  <text start="70.9" dur="4.59">this that the economy is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="72.97" dur="7.289">it&amp;#39;s collapsing right in front of our</text>
  <text start="75.49" dur="7.47">eyes and we can see the entire system is</text>
  <text start="80.259" dur="5.761">starting to break down deutsches bank</text>
  <text start="82.96" dur="5.07">dominic calm stem says there&amp;#39;s little</text>
  <text start="86.02" dur="5.4">evidence that productivity is ready to</text>
  <text start="88.03" dur="5.119">do any type of heavy lifting he said</text>
  <text start="91.42" dur="4.229">with personal consumption expenditures</text>
  <text start="93.149" dur="5.5">surging at an annualized two-point-eight</text>
  <text start="95.649" dur="5.821">percent rate nearly triple that recorded</text>
  <text start="98.649" dur="5.191">in the first quarter we are in big</text>
  <text start="101.47" dur="6.09">trouble this means that the non consumer</text>
  <text start="103.84" dur="7.229">part of the US economy subtracted one</text>
  <text start="107.56" dur="5.82">point six percent from GDP growth in the</text>
  <text start="111.069" dur="6.241">second quarter in fact Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="113.38" dur="5.879">calculates that on an annual basis the</text>
  <text start="117.31" dur="6.119">non consumer portion of the economy is</text>
  <text start="119.259" dur="7.191">shrinking it&amp;#39;s in a recession not only</text>
  <text start="123.429" dur="6.39">in real terms but also in nominal terms</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="5.86">this means that excluding the</text>
  <text start="129.819" dur="6.75">contribution from the US consumer the US</text>
  <text start="132.31" dur="6.63">economy is now in a recession mo we know</text>
  <text start="136.569" dur="4.261">it&amp;#39;s a lot worse than this because when</text>
  <text start="138.94" dur="3.24">we look at the economy we have been</text>
  <text start="140.83" dur="4.71">tracking this we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="142.18" dur="7.05">every sector of the economy and each</text>
  <text start="145.54" dur="6.21">sector is proving that it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="149.23" dur="5.42">worse and worse as time goes on look at</text>
  <text start="151.75" dur="5.91">this business spending is in a recession</text>
  <text start="154.65" dur="4.839">equipment spending fel- three-point-five</text>

  <text start="167.23" dur="7.41">by negative 6.1 % last quarter this</text>
  <text start="171.88" dur="7.16">whole thing is falling apart then we</text>
  <text start="174.64" dur="6.72">take a look at the GDP GDP is</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="5.5">continually declining now we know GDP</text>
  <text start="181.36" dur="5.82">has been manipulated they included</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="7.77">research and development going all the</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="6.63">way back to the depression of 1929 then</text>
  <text start="192.31" dur="5.31">calculated the numbers all the way back</text>
  <text start="193.81" dur="6.18">up to the present time GDP includes</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="4.65">Obamacare spending and you know as the</text>
  <text start="199.99" dur="7.65">premiums continually rise guess what</text>
  <text start="202.27" dur="7.55">happens GDP looks better and better but</text>
  <text start="207.64" dur="7.77">everything is starting to break down now</text>
  <text start="209.82" dur="9.37">actually Barack Obama remains on track</text>
  <text start="215.41" dur="6.72">to be the only president in all of us</text>
  <text start="219.19" dur="4.53">history history to never have a single</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="4.56">year when the economy grew by at least</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="5.04">three percent every other president in</text>
  <text start="226.69" dur="6.09">American history even the really bad</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="7.44">ones had at least one year when US gdp</text>
  <text start="232.78" dur="6.33">grew by at least three percent and when</text>
  <text start="236.2" dur="7.05">we look at this we see 2009 negative two</text>
  <text start="239.11" dur="9.41">point eight percent 2010 2.5% 2011</text>
  <text start="243.25" dur="13.77">one-point-six percent 2012 2.2% 2013</text>
  <text start="248.52" dur="10.6">1.5% 2014 2.4% 2015 2.4% this year not</text>
  <text start="257.02" dur="8.01">looking good whatsoever it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="8.43">getting worse now Egypt they need a</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="5.1">bailout a delegation from the</text>
  <text start="267.55" dur="5.43">International Monetary Fund they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="5.31">arrived in Egypt because they responded</text>
  <text start="272.98" dur="7.11">to a request for a multi-billion dollar</text>
  <text start="275.44" dur="6.99">bailout the country&amp;#39;s economy is not</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="4.82">doing anything right now it is dead in</text>
  <text start="282.43" dur="5.34">the water and what they&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re looking for a 12 billion dollar</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="4.8">loan from the IMF over three years as</text>
  <text start="289.78" dur="6.24">well as a seven billion from other</text>
  <text start="292.57" dur="5.43">sources but there&amp;#39;s a problem here what</text>
  <text start="296.02" dur="4.41">the what they&amp;#39;re going to need to do</text>
  <text start="298" dur="7.8">is that the Egyptian government is going</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="9.96">to need to cut different areas in the</text>
  <text start="305.8" dur="7.55">country because according to the IMF to</text>
  <text start="310.39" dur="7.32">receive this bailout money there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="313.35" dur="9.99">certain preconditions they have to meet</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="7.83">criteria and that is broad cuts across</text>
  <text start="323.34" dur="6.79">every program that they have running</text>
  <text start="325.54" dur="8.01">right now and the people of Egypt well</text>
  <text start="330.13" dur="4.65">they don&amp;#39;t like this they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="333.55" dur="4.619">this they don&amp;#39;t like austerity</text>
  <text start="334.78" dur="6.18">whatsoever and we might see riots and</text>
  <text start="338.169" dur="4.791">protests in the streets in Egypt and</text>
  <text start="340.96" dur="6.48">this is something that we need to watch</text>
  <text start="342.96" dur="8.92">now President Obama just sign something</text>
  <text start="347.44" dur="7.56">called the Dark Act denying Americans</text>
  <text start="351.88" dur="7.11">the right to know obama signed into law</text>
  <text start="355" dur="6.919">s 7 64 now the dark acts were a way to</text>
  <text start="358.99" dur="5.37">establish federal labeling and</text>
  <text start="361.919" dur="4.391">realistically it would banish all state</text>
  <text start="364.36" dur="4.89">labeling initiatives under a federal</text>
  <text start="366.31" dur="6.75">standard white house simply mentioned a</text>
  <text start="369.25" dur="5.58">list of bills and s 7 64 which directs</text>
  <text start="373.06" dur="4.43">the Secretary of Agriculture to</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="5.19">establish a national mandatory</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="5.92">bioengineered food disclosure standard</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="6.78">and this was listed at the end here the</text>
  <text start="383.41" dur="5.49">disclosure standard must be an inside</text>
  <text start="386.8" dur="4.32">job because the disclosure involves the</text>
  <text start="388.9" dur="3.99">consumer having to scan a QR code on a</text>
  <text start="391.12" dur="3.96">food product to find out about</text>
  <text start="392.89" dur="5.39">genetically modified ingredients or</text>
  <text start="395.08" dur="5.839">they&amp;#39;ll have to call a 1-800 number now</text>
  <text start="398.28" dur="7.57">these measures might not happen in</text>
  <text start="400.919" dur="7.951">another five years so really what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="405.85" dur="6.93">seeing here is they&amp;#39;re trying to delay</text>
  <text start="408.87" dur="5.71">the labeling of GM foods they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="412.78" dur="6.03">the state to do it and the consumerist</text>
  <text start="414.58" dur="5.52">notes that on this bill it also directs</text>
  <text start="418.81" dur="3.27">the Secretary of Agriculture to</text>
  <text start="420.1" dur="4.14">eventually at some point two to three</text>
  <text start="422.08" dur="5.88">years maybe come with come up with a</text>
  <text start="424.24" dur="5.91">national labeling standard however the</text>
  <text start="427.96" dur="3.87">standard could be incredibly weak and</text>
  <text start="430.15" dur="3.66">provide virtually no information</text>
  <text start="431.83" dur="6.36">the consumer on the label whatsoever</text>
  <text start="433.81" dur="7.5">just label it claims that the law allows</text>
  <text start="438.19" dur="4.71">the USDA to a determine what GMO</text>
  <text start="441.31" dur="3.54">information is provided through the</text>
  <text start="442.9" dur="3.9">voluntary labeling system and we&amp;#39;ll make</text>
  <text start="444.85" dur="3.72">it harder for companies like Campbell</text>
  <text start="446.8" dur="4.08">Soup to voluntarily disclose the</text>
  <text start="448.57" dur="4.77">presence of GMOs they also claim that</text>
  <text start="450.88" dur="4.62">the law would deny local governments</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="4.62">from being able to protect farmers rural</text>
  <text start="455.5" dur="7.85">residents from environmental impacts of</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="7.98">GMO crops they don&amp;#39;t want people to know</text>
  <text start="463.35" dur="4.93">they don&amp;#39;t want people to understand</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="5.67">what&amp;#39;s in their food and if I&amp;#39;m eating</text>
  <text start="468.28" dur="6.63">something just like you you want to know</text>
  <text start="471.61" dur="7.14">what is in my food is it genetically</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="6.15">modified organisms is it natural food is</text>
  <text start="478.75" dur="5.06">it organic we have a right to know and</text>
  <text start="481.06" dur="6.24">the government has no business</text>
  <text start="483.81" dur="7.87">whatsoever trying to keep this</text>
  <text start="487.3" dur="7.53">information from us now it seems that a</text>
  <text start="491.68" dur="7.17">French delegation is going to visit</text>
  <text start="494.83" dur="7.29">Crimea they want to see how the people</text>
  <text start="498.85" dur="6.87">are faring in Crimea since now Crimea is</text>
  <text start="502.12" dur="5.34">part of Russia and we can see that they</text>
  <text start="505.72" dur="6.87">are visiting now this is the second time</text>
  <text start="507.46" dur="7.14">that they visited the peninsula the</text>
  <text start="512.59" dur="3.72">referendum on Crimea&amp;#39;s ascension to</text>
  <text start="514.6" dur="3.32">Russia reflected the will of the people</text>
  <text start="516.31" dur="5.22">and this is coming from the former</text>
  <text start="517.92" dur="5.26">Transport Minister saying that the</text>
  <text start="521.53" dur="3.9">people in this country it looks very</text>
  <text start="523.18" dur="5.52">peaceful people seem to be very happy</text>
  <text start="525.43" dur="4.68">and if this didn&amp;#39;t happen this area</text>
  <text start="528.7" dur="5.91">would have turned out to be like the</text>
  <text start="530.11" dur="6.99">southeastern area the French people they</text>
  <text start="534.61" dur="5.25">want to get do away with the sanctions</text>
  <text start="537.1" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s hurting their economy actually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.86" dur="6">hurting Europe as a whole and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="543.25" dur="4.17">getting any better and there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="545.86" dur="2.94">countries that are out there saying you</text>
  <text start="547.42" dur="3.65">know something we need to get rid of</text>
  <text start="548.8" dur="4.41">these sanctions it&amp;#39;s not helping us and</text>
  <text start="551.07" dur="5.56">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of these countries</text>
  <text start="553.21" dur="5.67">like Italy we&amp;#39;re looking at France even</text>
  <text start="556.63" dur="5.28">Germany is saying you know something we</text>
  <text start="558.88" dur="5.29">need to take another look at this now</text>
  <text start="561.91" dur="4.15">the u.s.</text>
  <text start="564.17" dur="7.19">they had a surveillance plane at Boeing</text>
  <text start="566.06" dur="9.769">OC 3135 be and they had to make a</text>
  <text start="571.36" dur="6.849">landing in Russia was a forced landing</text>
  <text start="575.829" dur="5.651">now the american crew detected a</text>
  <text start="578.209" dur="7.38">malfunctioning of landing gear and they</text>
  <text start="581.48" dur="5.58">asked permission to land in russia now</text>
  <text start="585.589" dur="5.671">they were supposed to use this plane to</text>
  <text start="587.06" dur="5.82">do an open sky flyover of russia but</text>
  <text start="591.26" dur="4.04">there are suggestions that the</text>
  <text start="592.88" dur="5.759">malfunctioning was not coincidental and</text>
  <text start="595.3" dur="7.27">perhaps related to recent military</text>
  <text start="598.639" dur="5.521">exercises in the area and they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="602.57" dur="3.69">looking into this so this is a situation</text>
  <text start="604.16" dur="6.78">that we need to follow we see the United</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="7.889">States right now they are deploying b1</text>
  <text start="610.94" dur="6.42">bombers to Guam now this is the first</text>
  <text start="614.149" dur="5.671">time in nearly ten years the Air Force</text>
  <text start="617.36" dur="5.669">will deploy a squadron of long-range b-1</text>
  <text start="619.82" dur="6.84">Lancer bombers to Guam of course we know</text>
  <text start="623.029" dur="7.25">what this is for this is to provoke</text>
  <text start="626.66" dur="6.39">China now there were b-52 bombers</text>
  <text start="630.279" dur="5.441">currently stationed in Guam now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="633.05" dur="8.01">removing those and bringing in these B</text>
  <text start="635.72" dur="9.53">ones and they&amp;#39;re saying this is to keep</text>
  <text start="641.06" dur="8.43">the region safe secure keep it stable</text>
  <text start="645.25" dur="6.579">the question is from what now the</text>
  <text start="649.49" dur="5.58">question is that they&amp;#39;re using this to</text>
  <text start="651.829" dur="6.411">encircle China and they want to bring in</text>
  <text start="655.07" dur="5.69">more of these bombers and place them in</text>
  <text start="658.24" dur="5.86">each one of the countries that is</text>
  <text start="660.76" dur="7.05">encircling China and we can see what is</text>
  <text start="664.1" dur="6.51">happening right now they&amp;#39;re pushing and</text>
  <text start="667.81" dur="8.17">provoking china just like North Korea</text>
  <text start="670.61" dur="7.8">Russia because they want something to</text>
  <text start="675.98" dur="6.51">happen they want these countries to do</text>
  <text start="678.41" dur="6.6">something they want war period now</text>
  <text start="682.49" dur="5.579">Turkish prosecutors they claim that the</text>
  <text start="685.01" dur="6.689">CIA FBI they trained the coup plotters</text>
  <text start="688.069" dur="5.721">now we know this to be true because this</text>
  <text start="691.699" dur="4.981">has happened many many times before and</text>
  <text start="693.79" dur="4.13">we can see right now that we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="696.68" dur="3.55">more indicators</text>
  <text start="697.92" dur="5.19">that Earl one is pulling away from the</text>
  <text start="700.23" dur="6.84">west and it&amp;#39;s starting to look like her</text>
  <text start="703.11" dur="6.93">Dhawan knew about the coup the US wanted</text>
  <text start="707.07" dur="5.4">early one out of power to push their</text>
  <text start="710.04" dur="5.76">mission into Syria Dhawan was not</text>
  <text start="712.47" dur="6.5">cooperating her Dhawan decided let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="715.8" dur="6.3">move over to Russia closer to there and</text>
  <text start="718.97" dur="6.85">we&amp;#39;re starting to see evidence now that</text>
  <text start="722.1" dur="8.13">most likely this is true because just</text>
  <text start="725.82" dur="7.11">yesterday turkey surrounded the Incirlik</text>
  <text start="730.23" dur="4.409">Air Base of course they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="732.93" dur="4.649">excuse that there could have been a</text>
  <text start="734.639" dur="6.241">second coup but he has raced he arrested</text>
  <text start="737.579" dur="5.31">like 70,000 plus people that were</text>
  <text start="740.88" dur="5.28">involved in the first coup who is left</text>
  <text start="742.889" dur="7.351">to have a coup another excuse is it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="746.16" dur="6.119">security operation safety inspection but</text>
  <text start="750.24" dur="4.08">there are seven thousand armed police</text>
  <text start="752.279" dur="4.05">with heavy vehicles that surrounded the</text>
  <text start="754.32" dur="4.68">base and I think what he&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="756.329" dur="6.241">prepared to do is he&amp;#39;s getting prepared</text>
  <text start="759" dur="6.779">to tell the u.s. to get out of this area</text>
  <text start="762.57" dur="6.3">and I think they&amp;#39;re using this as a way</text>

  <text start="866.37" dur="7.14">be true and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="869.25" dur="8.27">is a point in time where the united</text>
  <text start="873.51" dur="8.78">states has very few options left one</text>
  <text start="877.52" dur="8.02">continue on this path and russia and</text>
  <text start="882.29" dur="7.54">assad forces continually clear out the</text>
  <text start="885.54" dur="6.33">country take it back the u.s. ends up</text>
  <text start="889.83" dur="3.72">with nothing they have to leave Syria</text>
  <text start="891.87" dur="4.53">because what what would what would be</text>
  <text start="893.55" dur="4.98">the reason for the United States to be</text>

  <text start="898.53" dur="5.1">state is completely gone there is no</text>

  <text start="919.56" dur="4.8">clearing out the Islamic state they have</text>
  <text start="921.75" dur="4.2">about ten percent of the land left so</text>
  <text start="924.36" dur="4.46">what does the United States do at this</text>
  <text start="925.95" dur="5.88">point they can continue along this path</text>
  <text start="928.82" dur="6.82">they can lose Syria there&amp;#39;s no reason to</text>
  <text start="931.83" dur="4.92">go into Iraq they lose a lot of the</text>
  <text start="935.64" dur="4.47">Middle East because the people are</text>
  <text start="936.75" dur="5.82">fighting back so they have two options</text>
  <text start="940.11" dur="5.61">really at this point go along with the</text>
  <text start="942.57" dur="4.98">present strategy they&amp;#39;ll just lose the</text>
  <text start="945.72" dur="3.96">entire area the petro dollar will</text>
  <text start="947.55" dur="3.18">collapse and we&amp;#39;ll have the collapse and</text>
  <text start="949.68" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;ll just blame it on the central</text>
  <text start="950.73" dur="5.76">bankers or they need some type of an</text>
  <text start="953.1" dur="4.62">event they need a plan and this is what</text>
  <text start="956.49" dur="4.56">everyone should be worried about at this</text>
  <text start="957.72" dur="5.52">point because the United States they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="961.05" dur="4.46">at their end game the economy&amp;#39;s at its</text>
  <text start="963.24" dur="4.5">end game and</text>
  <text start="965.51" dur="6.52">there&amp;#39;s really no way out of this at</text>
