  <text start="62.769" dur="4.871">2017 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.119" dur="5.401">every time this economic indicator</text>
  <text start="67.64" dur="6">inverts we are headed for an economic</text>
  <text start="70.52" dur="5.37">disaster let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.64" dur="4.619">collapse financial news now we are</text>
  <text start="75.89" dur="5.519">getting more and more economic data in</text>
  <text start="78.259" dur="5.371">and we know the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="81.409" dur="4.951">using the stats saying yes unemployment</text>
  <text start="83.63" dur="4.14">is low everything looks great the Fed is</text>
  <text start="86.36" dur="3.48">telling everyone that looks great even</text>
  <text start="87.77" dur="4.2">Trump is out there he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="89.84" dur="4.74">the stock market is up the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="91.97" dur="5.009">doing well unemployment is very low and</text>
  <text start="94.58" dur="5.01">he&amp;#39;s promising to bring back all these</text>
  <text start="96.979" dur="5.101">jobs and I&amp;#39;ll explain his strategy of</text>
  <text start="99.59" dur="4.8">why he is saying this a little bit later</text>
  <text start="102.08" dur="5.76">in this report but let&amp;#39;s look at some of</text>
  <text start="104.39" dur="5.31">the economic indicators here first we</text>
  <text start="107.84" dur="3.99">have existing home sales which are</text>
  <text start="109.7" dur="4.38">declining we have new home sales which</text>
  <text start="111.83" dur="5.459">are declined which are declining right</text>
  <text start="114.08" dur="6.78">now we have for the first time since</text>
  <text start="117.289" dur="5.431">January of 2009 housing starts</text>
  <text start="120.86" dur="4.5">they dropped for the third month in a</text>
  <text start="122.72" dur="5.549">row in May and they completely missed</text>
  <text start="125.36" dur="4.98">expectations of a positive 4.1 percent</text>
  <text start="128.269" dur="5.311">it was down negative five point five</text>
  <text start="130.34" dur="6.119">percent building permits also tumbled in</text>
  <text start="133.58" dur="5.22">May and they missed expectations so</text>
  <text start="136.459" dur="5.701">we&amp;#39;re seeing the housing market</text>
  <text start="138.8" dur="4.86">completely implode on itself and this is</text>
  <text start="142.16" dur="5.13">the lowest level for overall housing</text>
  <text start="143.66" dur="4.049">starts since 2016 so what is going on</text>
  <text start="147.29" dur="2.64">here</text>
  <text start="147.709" dur="4.231">well we&amp;#39;ve been receiving really bad</text>
  <text start="149.93" dur="3.66">economic data we know a lot of retail</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="5.43">stores are closing corporations laying</text>
  <text start="153.59" dur="6.119">off and most of the statistics that the</text>
  <text start="157.37" dur="4.44">US government the Fed puts out but</text>
  <text start="159.709" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re completely manipulated and we</text>
  <text start="161.81" dur="4.349">know that they said well they raised the</text>
  <text start="163.849" dur="4.051">interest rates once again now we need to</text>
  <text start="166.159" dur="3.631">understand something they already</text>
  <text start="167.9" dur="4.35">started the process of bringing down the</text>
  <text start="169.79" dur="5.4">economy all they&amp;#39;ve done was accelerated</text>
  <text start="172.25" dur="5.79">now now remember this period of time in</text>
  <text start="175.19" dur="4.019">real estate is supposed to be the best</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="3.63">time in real estate</text>
  <text start="179.209" dur="4.321">spring/summer this is when people want</text>
  <text start="181.67" dur="3.659">to get into their homes they want to set</text>
  <text start="183.53" dur="2.89">up their homes people like the warm</text>
  <text start="185.329" dur="3.101">weather there</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="5.039">hours in front of the houses it makes it</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="4.47">much easier to move into a home and they</text>
  <text start="191.459" dur="3.691">want to get into the home before school</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="4.88">starts what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="195.15" dur="6.03">that the housing market well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.78" dur="5.11">imploding on itself during the best time</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="4.2">just like we saw the retail industry</text>
  <text start="202.89" dur="5.58">implode on itself during the best time</text>
  <text start="205.38" dur="4.5">which is the holiday season and this is</text>
  <text start="208.47" dur="4.83">just going to get worse because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.88" dur="5.939">happening right now is the interest</text>
  <text start="213.3" dur="4.14">rates have been moving up mortgage</text>
  <text start="215.819" dur="5.311">applications have been declining</text>
  <text start="217.44" dur="6.03">it pushes individuals completely out of</text>
  <text start="221.13" dur="5.37">the market and what we see now is</text>
  <text start="223.47" dur="4.95">traffic is drying up and if you look</text>
  <text start="226.5" dur="4.53">around the country just go on to Zillow</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="5.129">yes there&amp;#39;s still places we are still</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="4.41">going to see real estate booming those</text>
  <text start="233.549" dur="3.75">places where they&amp;#39;ve been booming for</text>
  <text start="235.44" dur="3">quite a while they&amp;#39;ll take a little bit</text>
  <text start="237.299" dur="5.881">longer but they&amp;#39;re going to be hit very</text>
  <text start="238.44" dur="7.799">very hard look back to 2007-2008 and</text>
  <text start="243.18" dur="3.93">just look in Miami area where there were</text>
  <text start="246.239" dur="3.06">cranes</text>
  <text start="247.11" dur="5.4">all over the place there were condos</text>
  <text start="249.299" dur="5.821">being built like crazy and it was</text>
  <text start="252.51" dur="4.259">booming with speculator like you</text>
  <text start="255.12" dur="4.38">speculators like you&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="4.981">before and then all of a sudden it came</text>
  <text start="259.5" dur="5.76">crashing down and it was a lot worse</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="5.61">than almost every other place and we</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="6.93">could see right now this is going to</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="6.66">spread into every single area and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="272.19" dur="4.47">just going to get worse actually the New</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="5.79">York Fed they&amp;#39;ve already adjusted their</text>
  <text start="276.66" dur="6.69">second quarter GDP and they started out</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="6">at 3% they&amp;#39;re down to one point eight</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="5.16">six percent right now and believe me</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="4.979">it&amp;#39;s going to go much much lower we also</text>
  <text start="288.51" dur="5.31">see the Atlanta Fed right now they have</text>
  <text start="290.789" dur="5.431">adjusted their information on the GDP of</text>
  <text start="293.82" dur="4.65">their estimates and we see they started</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="3.78">at four then they went down to 3.2 now</text>
  <text start="298.47" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re down to two point eight seven</text>
  <text start="300" dur="4.139">eight and we can see this is continually</text>
  <text start="302.19" dur="4.44">going lower and lower and when we look</text>
  <text start="304.139" dur="5.311">at this we see the hard data points well</text>
  <text start="306.63" dur="5.52">they are continually declining even the</text>
  <text start="309.45" dur="5.7">soft data now is declining at the same</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="6.24">rate so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is everything</text>
  <text start="315.15" dur="4.54">starting to fall apart very very quickly</text>
  <text start="318.39" dur="4.15">now</text>
  <text start="319.69" dur="4.8">one thing that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at and</text>
  <text start="322.54" dur="5.19">these are the different economic</text>
  <text start="324.49" dur="5.7">indicators and each one tells us a story</text>
  <text start="327.73" dur="5.01">well we&amp;#39;re heading into a collapse now</text>
  <text start="330.19" dur="5.07">every time the Fed tightens and we look</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="4.92">back in time we see that we enter some</text>
  <text start="335.26" dur="4.71">type of recession or depression well</text>
  <text start="337.66" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re tightening once again and they</text>
  <text start="339.97" dur="4.05">only can drive the interest rates up to</text>
  <text start="342.25" dur="2.28">a certain point until everything falls</text>
  <text start="344.02" dur="2.94">apart</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="4.89">and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the inverted</text>
  <text start="346.96" dur="6.93">yield curve now we mentioned this before</text>
  <text start="349.42" dur="8.13">and this happened seven times in a row</text>
  <text start="353.89" dur="6.29">and every time the yield curve inverted</text>
  <text start="357.55" dur="5.43">we went into a recession or depression</text>
  <text start="360.18" dur="6.28">so this is a very good indicator to let</text>
  <text start="362.98" dur="6.27">us know where we are headed and right</text>
  <text start="366.46" dur="5.13">now for those who are not familiar with</text>
  <text start="369.25" dur="4.8">the terminology of an inverted yield</text>
  <text start="371.59" dur="4.92">curve when we talk about a yield curve</text>
  <text start="374.05" dur="5.58">we&amp;#39;re typically talking about the spread</text>
  <text start="376.51" dur="6.15">between two-year and 10-year US Treasury</text>
  <text start="379.63" dur="5.31">bond yields normally long-term rates are</text>
  <text start="382.66" dur="3.99">higher than the short-term rates but</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="2.34">when investors get spooked about the</text>
  <text start="386.65" dur="4.46">economy</text>
  <text start="387.28" dur="8.49">this can reverse just before every</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="7.6">single recession since the 60s the yield</text>
  <text start="395.77" dur="5.19">curve has inverted and now we are</text>
  <text start="398.71" dur="4.86">getting dangerously close to it</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="6.66">happening again for the first time in a</text>
  <text start="403.57" dur="5.82">decade so what we&amp;#39;ve seen on Thursday is</text>
  <text start="407.62" dur="3.93">that the spread between the two-year and</text>
  <text start="409.39" dur="4.53">10-year Treasuries dropped to just 79</text>
  <text start="411.55" dur="6.78">basis points this is almost the tightest</text>
  <text start="413.92" dur="6.87">the yield curve has been since 2007 so</text>
  <text start="418.33" dur="5.51">why is an inverted yield curve such a</text>
  <text start="420.79" dur="5.76">big event because when bank assets</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="5.53">generate less income than the bank</text>
  <text start="426.55" dur="4.62">liabilities the incentive to make new</text>
  <text start="429.37" dur="4.98">loans dries up along with the money</text>
  <text start="431.17" dur="6.96">supply and when acid bubbles are starved</text>
  <text start="434.35" dur="5.55">of that monetary fuel they burst the</text>
  <text start="438.13" dur="4.31">severity of the recession depend on the</text>
  <text start="439.9" dur="6.27">intensity of the asset bubbles in</text>
  <text start="442.44" dur="7.03">existence prior to the inversion what do</text>
  <text start="446.17" dur="6.749">we see a couple days ago loan creation</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="3.99">stalling and declining what else could</text>
  <text start="452.919" dur="4.201">we say</text>
  <text start="453.46" dur="6.72">we saw the credit impulse going negative</text>
  <text start="457.12" dur="4.08">in January&amp;#39;s at negative one now it&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="460.18" dur="4.26">negative three</text>
  <text start="461.2" dur="5.13">so what&amp;#39;s truly alarming is that the</text>
  <text start="464.44" dur="2.43">Federal Reserve they see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.33" dur="2.13">happening</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="3.3">they see what&amp;#39;s happening with the yield</text>
  <text start="468.46" dur="3.96">curve they see what&amp;#39;s happening with the</text>
  <text start="470.17" dur="4.74">other economic indicators and what did</text>
  <text start="472.42" dur="6.24">they decide to do they decided to raise</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="5.93">their rates they know right now that</text>
  <text start="478.66" dur="4.08">this will bring down the economy and</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="3.94">they&amp;#39;re not just raising the rates</text>
  <text start="482.74" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re going beyond this they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="484.78" dur="4.47">declared that they&amp;#39;re going to unwind</text>
  <text start="486.58" dur="5.4">their four point five trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="489.25" dur="6.03">worth of assets that they&amp;#39;ve accumulated</text>
  <text start="491.98" dur="5.25">since the Great Recession I mean this is</text>
  <text start="495.28" dur="4.83">going to be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="497.23" dur="5.07">disaster and we could see that Trump</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="5.22">he&amp;#39;s playing into this think about this</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="7.17">how difficult would it be to bring down</text>
  <text start="505.33" dur="6.66">an economy yes he can get rid of the Fed</text>
  <text start="509.47" dur="6.54">he can take out his pen he has the power</text>
  <text start="511.99" dur="5.85">to do this and the Fed will be gone but</text>
  <text start="516.01" dur="4.8">do you think the deep state the elite</text>
  <text start="517.84" dur="5.73">the central bankers will allow this well</text>
  <text start="520.81" dur="4.89">let&amp;#39;s say JFK tried to create silver</text>
  <text start="523.57" dur="5.04">certificates what happened to him he was</text>
  <text start="525.7" dur="5.88">killed President Lincoln had the</text>
  <text start="528.61" dur="5.34">greenback printing currency outside of</text>
  <text start="531.58" dur="5.7">the central banking system well he was</text>
  <text start="533.95" dur="5.85">killed Andrew Jackson actually he</text>
  <text start="537.28" dur="6.03">succeeded but they attempted to murder</text>
  <text start="539.8" dur="6.51">him to kill him to assassinate him but</text>
  <text start="543.31" dur="5.43">it didn&amp;#39;t work and he eventually got rid</text>
  <text start="546.31" dur="3.96">of the central bank can Trump just go</text>
  <text start="548.74" dur="4.32">ahead and do this no most likely they</text>
  <text start="550.27" dur="7.55">will try to get rid of him in a split</text>
  <text start="553.06" dur="8.31">second so what strategy would you use to</text>
  <text start="557.82" dur="5.86">turn it around and blame everything on</text>
  <text start="561.37" dur="3.84">the Fed now the Fed has been controlling</text>
  <text start="563.68" dur="3.21">the economy right they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="565.21" dur="2.75">controlling the interest rates they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="566.89" dur="4.32">been controlling the money supply</text>
  <text start="567.96" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us how great the</text>
  <text start="571.21" dur="5.07">economy&amp;#39;s doing now he is out there</text>
  <text start="573.33" dur="5.5">telling us that the stock market&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="576.28" dur="6.84">well I&amp;#39;m bringing back jobs when the</text>
  <text start="578.83" dur="8.14">economy Falls how easy would it be for</text>
  <text start="583.12" dur="6.759">Trump to say to the Fed listen you</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="6.09">the money supply you were controlling</text>
  <text start="589.879" dur="5.4">the interest rates you&amp;#39;re the one who</text>
  <text start="593.06" dur="4.05">decided to raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="595.279" dur="4.441">during this period of time you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="597.11" dur="4.44">telling the American public and of</text>
  <text start="599.72" dur="3.539">course I believed you that if the stock</text>
  <text start="601.55" dur="5.729">market goes up the economy&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="603.259" dur="6.12">I was trying to bring back jobs and the</text>
  <text start="607.279" dur="3.75">economy crashed now of course the</text>
  <text start="609.379" dur="3.121">central bank can turn around say well it</text>
  <text start="611.029" dur="4.261">was because of your economic policy</text>
  <text start="612.5" dur="6.449">that&amp;#39;s why it crashed now Trump could</text>
  <text start="615.29" dur="7.919">say point out which area of my economic</text>
  <text start="618.949" dur="6.841">policy crashed the economy because what</text>
  <text start="623.209" dur="3">have I done so far since I&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="625.79" dur="3.029">office</text>
  <text start="626.209" dur="4.92">I promised jobs to come back to the</text>
  <text start="628.819" dur="5.401">United States what else have I done</text>
  <text start="631.129" dur="5.541">there&amp;#39;s nothing to point to he can turn</text>
  <text start="634.22" dur="5.099">around and say I didn&amp;#39;t do anything I</text>
  <text start="636.67" dur="3.13">promised these jobs I want to bring him</text>
  <text start="639.319" dur="2.58">back</text>
  <text start="639.8" dur="4.649">because you told us the economy was</text>
  <text start="641.899" dur="6.511">strong you said it was strong enough to</text>
  <text start="644.449" dur="7.44">raise the rates and now here we are this</text>
  <text start="648.41" dur="6.239">argument is a lot better to use to get</text>
  <text start="651.889" dur="5.911">rid of the Fed they&amp;#39;re the ones who were</text>
  <text start="654.649" dur="7.081">controlling the economy and he can make</text>
  <text start="657.8" dur="6.329">a case and bring people in agreement now</text>
  <text start="661.73" dur="3.419">this is not going to be easy look what</text>
  <text start="664.129" dur="3.93">happened with Comey</text>
  <text start="665.149" dur="5.641">I mean we have Rosenstein we had aj</text>
