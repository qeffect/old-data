  <text start="95.29" dur="8.069">whoever controls the economy will</text>
  <text start="100.18" dur="7.439">control it all the central bankers have</text>

  <text start="111.34" dur="7.68">bankers why do you think they like to</text>
  <text start="114.7" dur="6.68">loan currency to countries because they</text>
  <text start="119.02" dur="6.69">understood from the very very beginning</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="7.659">that the economy is the key it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="125.71" dur="6.39">having troops it&amp;#39;s not having the most</text>
  <text start="129.039" dur="5.481">advanced weapons it&amp;#39;s not about any of</text>
  <text start="132.1" dur="7.17">that not even about having technology</text>
  <text start="134.52" dur="10.15">it&amp;#39;s about controlling countries through</text>
  <text start="139.27" dur="9.63">their economy the economy is key now the</text>
  <text start="144.67" dur="7.74">Patriots they know this they understand</text>
  <text start="148.9" dur="7.56">that they need to control the economy</text>
  <text start="152.41" dur="6.3">this is why out in the UK you see this</text>
  <text start="156.46" dur="4.98">battle going on which is called brexit</text>
  <text start="158.71" dur="4.71">and we know that the central bankers</text>
  <text start="161.44" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re not just going to lay down and</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="4.83">say hey you know something</text>
  <text start="164.95" dur="6.39">we give gad take the control away from</text>
  <text start="168.25" dur="5.76">us we don&amp;#39;t care as you can see since</text>
  <text start="171.34" dur="5.97">the referendum it&amp;#39;s been what three plus</text>
  <text start="174.01" dur="5.49">years now they don&amp;#39;t want to give up</text>
  <text start="177.31" dur="5.58">control now even with Boris Johnson now</text>
  <text start="179.5" dur="4.89">fighting for this brexit they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="182.89" dur="5.01">going to fight back even though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="184.39" dur="6.78">telling everyone yes we agree they</text>
  <text start="187.9" dur="4.399">really don&amp;#39;t they really don&amp;#39;t want any</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="4.47">of this to happen</text>
  <text start="192.299" dur="5.891">unless it&amp;#39;s all in their favor which</text>
  <text start="195.64" dur="4.65">means nothing changes it just makes it</text>
  <text start="198.19" dur="4.079">look like something has changed now we</text>
  <text start="200.29" dur="5.22">know there are elections coming up in</text>
  <text start="202.269" dur="6.421">the UK this is part of Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="205.51" dur="5.58">steel and we have Corbin against Boris</text>
  <text start="208.69" dur="4.35">Johnson and the mainstream media and all</text>
  <text start="211.09" dur="5.04">the pollsters out there they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="213.04" dur="6.809">to make it seem like Corbin now is</text>
  <text start="216.13" dur="6.03">closing in on Johnson it&amp;#39;s unbelievable</text>
  <text start="219.849" dur="6.48">the numbers are very close now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="222.16" dur="6.57">seen this before this is nothing new why</text>
  <text start="226.329" dur="6.841">are they doing this they are doing this</text>
  <text start="228.73" dur="9.12">on purpose they understand that they</text>
  <text start="233.17" dur="7.98">need to convince the people that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.85" dur="6.539">both tied so anybody could be the winner</text>
  <text start="241.15" dur="7.29">and soon they&amp;#39;ll probably show Corbin in</text>
  <text start="244.389" dur="6.121">the lead which most likely is completely</text>
  <text start="248.44" dur="2.699">false we&amp;#39;ve seen this before here in the</text>
  <text start="250.51" dur="4.44">United States</text>
  <text start="251.139" dur="6.331">remember Trump and Clinton how did that</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="5.12">turn out I think at this point that</text>
  <text start="257.47" dur="5.61">people understand and they realize that</text>
  <text start="260.07" dur="4.9">these type of tricks will not work</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="4.559">actually if we reverse and we go back</text>
  <text start="264.97" dur="4.52">before the referendum they were telling</text>
  <text start="267.639" dur="6.15">everyone that look look at these numbers</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="6.609">the referendum is we do not leave that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="273.789" dur="5.161">what the people want that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="276.099" dur="6.69">polls are showing that we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="278.95" dur="6.54">leave and what happened the opposite</text>
  <text start="282.789" dur="6.121">happened now during the run-up they were</text>
  <text start="285.49" dur="5.73">pushing fear saying that if you vote for</text>
  <text start="288.91" dur="3.75">the referendum the store shelves are</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="3.36">gonna go empty you&amp;#39;ll have no</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="4.05">electricity it&amp;#39;ll be hard to get fuel</text>
  <text start="294.58" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;ll be hard to get medical equipment</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="2.64">and if you</text>
  <text start="298.06" dur="5.04">really think about it they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="299.35" dur="7.13">same exact tactics now if this brexit</text>
  <text start="303.1" dur="6.89">happens all this might come true and we</text>
  <text start="306.48" dur="7.63">know this is part of their fear tactic</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="6.429">it won&amp;#39;t work anymore the biggest</text>
  <text start="314.11" dur="5.7">problem that the elite essential banks</text>
  <text start="316.419" dur="5.101">the deep state the one thing that the</text>
  <text start="319.81" dur="5.79">problem that they&amp;#39;re having is that the</text>
  <text start="321.52" dur="7.29">people have woken up and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="325.6" dur="6.23">fight this it&amp;#39;s very very difficult when</text>
  <text start="328.81" dur="6.98">you have a population that is now awake</text>
  <text start="331.83" dur="7.72">here in the United States what do we see</text>
  <text start="335.79" dur="6.07">we see Trump and the Patriots holding on</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="5.58">to the economic narrative actually they</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="8.25">control the economic narrative Trump</text>
  <text start="345.13" dur="8.22">understands that you need to control the</text>
  <text start="350.11" dur="6.029">economy that is the key to everything</text>
  <text start="353.35" dur="4.62">and I&amp;#39;m not just talking about the</text>
  <text start="356.139" dur="7.671">statistical numbers I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="357.97" dur="10.199">the creation of currency that is the key</text>
  <text start="363.81" dur="7.54">because when you take that away from a</text>
  <text start="368.169" dur="7.771">private western central bank they lose</text>
  <text start="371.35" dur="8.61">all power they have nothing to hold over</text>
  <text start="375.94" dur="7.08">you and what does that mean that means</text>
  <text start="379.96" dur="6.57">they can&amp;#39;t push anything now we need to</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="5.76">get to that point we need to get rid of</text>
  <text start="386.53" dur="5.19">the central bank and that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="388.78" dur="6.33">the difficult part because the central</text>
  <text start="391.72" dur="5.31">bank they like control they like what</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="4.38">they have they have completely different</text>
  <text start="397.03" dur="5.07">plans their plans are very different</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="4.44">than what the Patriots are planning the</text>
  <text start="402.1" dur="4.289">Patriots are planning to give the</text>
  <text start="403.93" dur="5.67">creation of currency the economy back to</text>
  <text start="406.389" dur="6.111">the people the central bank&amp;#39;s plan is to</text>
  <text start="409.6" dur="7.08">keep control of it and to enslave the</text>
  <text start="412.5" dur="5.919">people that is the biggest thing and we</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="6.57">need to understand is that the central</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="7.171">bank it is in no way a benefit to the</text>
  <text start="423.25" dur="4.47">people I know a lot of people want to</text>
  <text start="425.59" dur="4.29">convince you that yes the central bank</text>
  <text start="427.72" dur="4.47">is needed we need the central bank</text>
  <text start="429.88" dur="4.17">because they protect us from</text>
  <text start="432.19" dur="4.8">sessions they keep the economy moving</text>
  <text start="434.05" dur="7.08">along actually it&amp;#39;s not true whatsoever</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="6.56">how many recessions have we had and who</text>
  <text start="441.13" dur="6.06">was in control oh that&amp;#39;s right it was</text>
  <text start="443.55" dur="6.88">the private was a central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="447.19" dur="6.84">the ones who caused it they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="450.43" dur="7.29">who create these problems and they do it</text>
  <text start="454.03" dur="6.87">on purpose there&amp;#39;s always a reason why</text>
  <text start="457.72" dur="8.36">we go into a recession there&amp;#39;s always a</text>
  <text start="460.9" dur="8.37">reason why they need this type of stuff</text>
  <text start="466.08" dur="5.59">it&amp;#39;s called control they also make</text>
  <text start="469.27" dur="4.5">profit and when it&amp;#39;s time for them to</text>
  <text start="471.67" dur="4.56">make profit or make sure that other</text>
  <text start="473.77" dur="5.28">individuals make profit they do this on</text>
  <text start="476.23" dur="7.86">purpose but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s about control it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.05" dur="7.17">about hurting the people each time it</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="4.5">doesn&amp;#39;t help the people when we have a</text>
  <text start="486.22" dur="6.96">recession it hurts</text>
  <text start="488.59" dur="7.53">many many people think about in 2008 how</text>
  <text start="493.18" dur="5.58">many people were hurt during this period</text>
  <text start="496.12" dur="5.04">of time now yes there are certain</text>
  <text start="498.76" dur="6.39">individuals that recovered but there are</text>
  <text start="501.16" dur="6.06">many that never recovered they lost</text>
  <text start="505.15" dur="4.32">their house they lost their job now they</text>
  <text start="507.22" dur="5.4">might have gotten another job but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.47" dur="5.94">not the same job they had before it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.62" dur="5.58">lower pay they&amp;#39;re not doing as well they</text>
  <text start="515.41" dur="7.95">had to adjust this is all done on</text>
  <text start="518.2" dur="9.96">purpose to make the central bank have</text>
  <text start="523.36" dur="7.28">more power over the people and this has</text>
  <text start="528.16" dur="5.7">been going on for a very long time</text>
  <text start="530.64" dur="7.42">patriots around the world understand</text>
  <text start="533.86" dur="6.27">that this is the key yes you can get rid</text>
  <text start="538.06" dur="5.04">of the deep state yes you can get rid of</text>
  <text start="540.13" dur="5.31">those corrupt individuals but the key to</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="8.13">all of this to everything that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.44" dur="8.19">looking at is to break the economy back</text>
  <text start="551.23" dur="5.1">to the people the creation of currency</text>
  <text start="553.63" dur="6.09">back to the people we we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="556.33" dur="6.81">middleman anymore there&amp;#39;s no reason for</text>
  <text start="559.72" dur="5.73">it Andrew Jackson understood this this</text>
  <text start="563.14" dur="3.03">is why he ran on a platform to get rid</text>
  <text start="565.45" dur="1.92">of the central bank</text>
  <text start="566.17" dur="4.08">get rid of this whompin if you really</text>
  <text start="567.37" dur="5.07">look at it his whole mission was to get</text>
  <text start="570.25" dur="5.22">rid of the swamp and that included the</text>
  <text start="572.44" dur="8.459">central bank what is Trump doing today</text>
  <text start="575.47" dur="8.03">he&amp;#39;s doing the same exact thing but he</text>
  <text start="580.899" dur="6.961">only has a short period of time to do it</text>
  <text start="583.5" dur="7.87">he doesn&amp;#39;t have 30 40 years because the</text>
  <text start="587.86" dur="7.229">central bank system is collapsing at an</text>
  <text start="591.37" dur="6.54">accelerated rate he went ahead and he</text>
  <text start="595.089" dur="5.461">told the Fed and not so many words that</text>
  <text start="597.91" dur="3.989">listen we need to keep this alive we</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="4.349">need you to lower interest rates we need</text>
  <text start="601.899" dur="6.601">stimulus this was all to keep the system</text>
  <text start="604.899" dur="6.721">alive long enough to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="608.5" dur="4.23">central bank and the whole thing is one</text>

  <text start="622.029" dur="7.49">corruption that will stand in his way</text>
  <text start="625" dur="8.579">he also has to redo the trade deals</text>
  <text start="629.519" dur="7.69">remove regulations we turned currency</text>
  <text start="633.579" dur="6.601">back to the people and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="637.209" dur="7.051">going to happen is everything will</text>
  <text start="640.18" dur="6.029">change and we have to remember that the</text>
