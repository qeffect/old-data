  <text start="190.48" dur="5.039">this out they don&amp;#39;t know what to do</text>
  <text start="192.4" dur="5.58">so they came up with some incredible</text>
  <text start="195.519" dur="5.761">type of information that will convince</text>
  <text start="197.98" dur="5.58">everyone that all of this is meaningless</text>
  <text start="201.28" dur="5.489">and what they&amp;#39;ve done through their</text>
  <text start="203.56" dur="6.649">investigation sourcing everything they</text>
  <text start="206.769" dur="6.661">said that this is a conspiracy theory</text>
  <text start="210.209" dur="5.321">ABC finally covers missing FBI texts</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="5.7">they broadcasted and they paint it as a</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="5.64">wild GOP conspiracy theory I mean this</text>
  <text start="219.13" dur="5">is just unbelievable this is all they</text>
  <text start="221.17" dur="5.849">have so they spent all this time</text>
  <text start="224.13" dur="4.63">convincing everyone that this is</text>
  <text start="227.019" dur="4.351">absolutely meaningless with absolutely</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="6.03">no proof whatsoever because how do you</text>
  <text start="231.37" dur="6.39">prove it all they can do is say it now</text>
  <text start="234.79" dur="6.059">Mueller he wants to interrogate Trump</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="4.77">under oath but Comey never did that to</text>
  <text start="240.849" dur="3.571">Hillary but they want to do it to Trump</text>
  <text start="242.53" dur="4.44">and there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of evidence</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="5.46">against Hillary but okay so Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="246.97" dur="4.41">investigation has climbed all the way to</text>
  <text start="249.88" dur="2.07">Trump because they realize they&amp;#39;ve run</text>
  <text start="251.38" dur="3.57">out of time</text>
  <text start="251.95" dur="5.4">they have nothing at all about Russian</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="4.379">collusion they spend all this time all</text>
  <text start="257.35" dur="3.27">this money millions of dollars and the</text>
  <text start="259.329" dur="2.851">investigation is turned up absolutely</text>
  <text start="260.62" dur="4.049">nothing because if they had something</text>
  <text start="262.18" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;d be all over the corporate media hey</text>
  <text start="264.669" dur="5.551">they would be going crazy over this so</text>
  <text start="267.85" dur="6.12">why do they want to interrogate Trump</text>
  <text start="270.22" dur="7.86">under oath because they&amp;#39;re hoping to get</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="6.75">him on perjury charges that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="278.08" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re trying to do they want to show</text>
  <text start="280.72" dur="6.09">that he lied so they can start the</text>
  <text start="283.87" dur="4.76">impeachment process this is their way of</text>
  <text start="286.81" dur="3.93">thinking this is what they want to do I</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="4.8">mean when Hillary was questioned by</text>
  <text start="290.74" dur="8.16">Comey he didn&amp;#39;t even take notes and</text>
  <text start="293.43" dur="8.5">right now Mueller is clearly taking the</text>
  <text start="298.9" dur="6.09">approach that let&amp;#39;s get Trump on</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="6.66">obstruction of justice justice since he</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="5.1">cannot show he conspired with Putin this</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="3.99">is all about trying to impeach Trump</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="5.699">that&amp;#39;s it this is what he&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
