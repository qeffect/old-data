  <text start="64.26" dur="4.35">the thought of the episode is we can</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="5.059">pretend all we want the u.s. is in a</text>
  <text start="68.61" dur="4.83">recession and heading for the big one</text>
  <text start="71.119" dur="4.781">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="73.44" dur="5.55">financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="75.9" dur="5.61">the economic sectors and I&amp;#39;m just going</text>
  <text start="78.99" dur="5.01">to call it let&amp;#39;s not pretend anymore the</text>
  <text start="81.51" dur="4.2">US economy the world economy we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="84" dur="3.84">entered a recession we&amp;#39;ve entered it a</text>
  <text start="85.71" dur="4.65">long time ago let&amp;#39;s stop the pretending</text>
  <text start="87.84" dur="4.86">right now even though the US government</text>
  <text start="90.36" dur="3.57">the Fed they&amp;#39;re never going to admit</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="3.9">that we&amp;#39;re in a recession they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="93.93" dur="4.56">admit this until much later on we are in</text>
  <text start="96.6" dur="4.32">a recession we&amp;#39;re headed towards the big</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="3.84">one and we can see by all the</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="3.54">information that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="102.33" dur="4.02">and following we can see that everything</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="4.439">that we&amp;#39;ve been saying has been coming</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="3.93">true now yes it&amp;#39;s been taking a very</text>
  <text start="108.899" dur="3.421">long time they&amp;#39;re very good at</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="3.81">manipulating think about how long it</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="3.68">took those individuals that were looking</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="4.68">into the subprime securities back in</text>
  <text start="116" dur="5.59">2005-2006 and they found out what was</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="5.19">going on and they predicted you know at</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="4.26">the end of 2006 it would come down in</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="3.99">the beginning of 2007 it would come down</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="4.53">at the end of 2007 it would come down</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="4.14">and they really thought that wow this</text>
  <text start="130.38" dur="4.2">should have come down a long time ago</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="4.77">and it kept going on all the way to the</text>
  <text start="134.58" dur="5.43">end of 2008 2009 to the beginning of</text>
  <text start="136.86" dur="5.67">2009 we&amp;#39;ve been following all the</text>
  <text start="140.01" dur="5.28">economic information and we realized</text>
  <text start="142.53" dur="4.44">that everything everywhere is falling</text>
  <text start="145.29" dur="4.89">apart now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at retail</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="4.95">numbers and we&amp;#39;ve been saying going way</text>
  <text start="150.18" dur="3.51">back that retail was going to</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="4.17">continually get worse and worse and</text>
  <text start="153.69" dur="5.01">worse as time went on even the holiday</text>
  <text start="156.09" dur="4.98">season was not going to do well and we</text>
  <text start="158.7" dur="4.08">kept on saying that stores were going to</text>
  <text start="161.07" dur="3.99">close we&amp;#39;re going to see more stores</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="4.26">close more stores go bankrupt and no</text>
  <text start="165.06" dur="3.899">overtime this is exactly what has</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="3.75">happened now the reason why we said this</text>
  <text start="168.959" dur="3.87">was happening was not because of the</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="5.82">weather not because people didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="172.829" dur="6.391">to buy stuff not because of online we</text>
  <text start="176.61" dur="4.56">said people were being laid off people</text>
  <text start="179.22" dur="4.86">didn&amp;#39;t have work the unemployment</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="4.77">numbers were fake phony we knew that</text>
  <text start="184.08" dur="3.03">people were getting maybe one to three</text>
  <text start="185.94" dur="3.21">part times</text>
  <text start="187.11" dur="4.89">mobs and people didn&amp;#39;t have the extra</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="5.55">funds to go out and pay for all the</text>
  <text start="192" dur="4.65">goods in retail and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="194.7" dur="4.38">right now and this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="6.24">Census Bureau where they&amp;#39;ve looked at</text>
  <text start="199.08" dur="8.37">the sales of retail and they looked at</text>
  <text start="202.89" dur="7.11">wages and we can see that wages and</text>
  <text start="207.45" dur="4.86">sales well it looks like they&amp;#39;re pretty</text>
  <text start="210" dur="5.73">much matching as things went through</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="6">time and as we look maybe back to 2008</text>
  <text start="215.73" dur="3.33">we saw it as wages started to drop guess</text>
  <text start="218.31" dur="3.39">what happened</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="3.69">retail sales started to drop as wages</text>
  <text start="221.7" dur="3.42">started to move up</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="5.16">retail sales started to move up we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="5.64">the point where wages are continually</text>
  <text start="227.91" dur="6.63">declining we&amp;#39;re seeing retail sales</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="6.63">declining and this is exactly what has</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="5.73">happened throughout time and as time</text>
  <text start="237.39" dur="4.38">goes forward here and more people lose</text>
  <text start="240.27" dur="4.2">their jobs more people lose their jobs</text>
  <text start="241.77" dur="4.92">in retail more people take part-time</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="4.59">jobs it&amp;#39;s going to get worse and worse</text>
  <text start="246.69" dur="4.65">and before you know it it&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="4.56">this period where people don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="251.34" dur="5.389">funds to spend in retail this is why we</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="5.01">see so many stores closing right now</text>
  <text start="256.729" dur="2.98">people are not saying hey you know</text>
  <text start="258.63" dur="2.639">something I don&amp;#39;t want to spend money in</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="3.721">brick-and-mortar stores I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="261.269" dur="4.861">spend all my money in online sales</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re not doing that that is a myth</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="3.87">that was created by the corporate media</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="5.13">same myth that they said people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="270" dur="4.53">shopping because it snowed it rained it</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="4.95">was a little windy out today the Sun was</text>
  <text start="274.53" dur="6.06">too bright they made every single excuse</text>
  <text start="277.53" dur="6.42">known to man kind that they could use</text>
  <text start="280.59" dur="6">and it all didn&amp;#39;t make sense and we</text>
  <text start="283.95" dur="5.13">could see today from what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="286.59" dur="6.96">looking at it is because people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="6.839">making the income that&amp;#39;s what is the</text>
  <text start="293.55" dur="5.16">problem people don&amp;#39;t have the high</text>
  <text start="295.919" dur="5.401">paying jobs and we&amp;#39;ve been mentioning</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="5.79">pensions before companies are in trouble</text>
  <text start="301.32" dur="6.78">with pensions and it looks like GE well</text>
  <text start="304.5" dur="7.2">they have the largest pension shortfall</text>
  <text start="308.1" dur="6.71">in the sp500 it&amp;#39;s a thirty 1 billion</text>
  <text start="311.7" dur="7.649">balance sheet hole that keeps growing</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="6.05">now what is happening here is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="319.349" dur="4.81">seeing company after</text>
  <text start="320.86" dur="6.209">the after company municipality city</text>
  <text start="324.159" dur="5.91">after city where they have these huge</text>
  <text start="327.069" dur="4.981">holes in pensions and they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="330.069" dur="4.921">to be able to support the pensions</text>
  <text start="332.05" dur="5.22">moving forward in the last two years ge</text>
  <text start="334.99" dur="5.04">spent little more than two billion on</text>
  <text start="337.27" dur="4.41">total pension contributions which hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="340.03" dur="3.9">been nearly enough to keep the overall</text>
  <text start="341.68" dur="4.949">shortfall from widening it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="343.93" dur="5.85">worse so G needs to come up with nearly</text>
  <text start="346.629" dur="6.931">five billion a year for ten years just</text>
  <text start="349.78" dur="5.55">to meet pension obligations and this</text>
  <text start="353.56" dur="3.389">assumes an annualized rate of return of</text>
  <text start="355.33" dur="4.25">about seven point five percent a year</text>
  <text start="356.949" dur="5.34">I mean warning bells are flashing here</text>
  <text start="359.58" dur="4.51">returns are far more likely to be zero</text>
  <text start="362.289" dur="5.22">or negative than anything approaching</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="7.139">seven point five percent and the danger</text>
  <text start="367.509" dur="7.921">of default is real and we see not just</text>
  <text start="371.229" dur="7.171">GE but many other pension plans they</text>
  <text start="375.43" dur="5.07">have the same exact problem and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.4" dur="4.829">going to be a complete disaster every as</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="4.71">we move forward now caterpillar they</text>
  <text start="383.229" dur="6">have been seeing about fifty four months</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="4.769">of declining sales and they hit</text>
  <text start="389.229" dur="3">rock-bottom</text>
  <text start="389.979" dur="4.86">this is a longer stretch of time than</text>
  <text start="392.229" dur="4.56">the Great Recession and just in the last</text>
  <text start="394.839" dur="4.14">maybe two or three months they&amp;#39;d had a</text>
  <text start="396.789" dur="3.99">little pop up a very tiny pop up in the</text>
  <text start="398.979" dur="5.101">last two months a third month they had a</text>
  <text start="400.779" dur="7.86">pop up and they grew by maybe 1% or so</text>
  <text start="404.08" dur="8.19">and what happened was out in China they</text>
  <text start="408.639" dur="6.3">decided to basically purchase a lot of</text>
  <text start="412.27" dur="5.519">equipment now this is a one-off thing</text>
  <text start="414.939" dur="4.711">like we&amp;#39;ve seen before just like the</text>
  <text start="417.789" dur="3.571">United States with the GDP right before</text>
  <text start="419.65" dur="4.109">the elections where we had this export</text>
  <text start="421.36" dur="4.859">of soybeans well we&amp;#39;ve never seen that</text>
  <text start="423.759" dur="5.791">again and GDP just crumbled after this</text>
  <text start="426.219" dur="5.431">this is a one little pop up and believe</text>
  <text start="429.55" dur="4.979">me this is not going to repair</text>
  <text start="431.65" dur="5.28">caterpillar plus caterpillar has been</text>
  <text start="434.529" dur="4.56">cloned closing plant after plant after</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="4.259">plant laying off thousands upon</text>
  <text start="439.089" dur="4.35">thousands of people buying back their</text>
  <text start="441.189" dur="4.921">shares and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="443.439" dur="4.681">this will not be able to this will not</text>
  <text start="446.11" dur="5.16">be able to sustain caterpillar</text>
  <text start="448.12" dur="5.53">whatsoever now we&amp;#39;re looking at all</text>
  <text start="451.27" dur="5.709">these bubbles in the</text>
  <text start="453.65" dur="5.7">market we see the stock market bubble we</text>
  <text start="456.979" dur="5.641">see the bond bubble derivative bubble</text>
  <text start="459.35" dur="6.21">housing bubble automobile bubble we see</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="5.579">bubbles all over the place and coming</text>
  <text start="465.56" dur="4.47">out of Bank of America David Wu asked if</text>
  <text start="468.199" dur="4.621">there&amp;#39;s a different motive behind the</text>
  <text start="470.03" dur="5.16">feds tightening intentions namely is the</text>
  <text start="472.82" dur="5.31">Fed trying to pop the market acid bubble</text>
  <text start="475.19" dur="5.069">of course they are this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="478.13" dur="6.24">been pushing the interest rates up very</text>
  <text start="480.259" dur="7.861">very slowly they want the bubbles to pop</text>
  <text start="484.37" dur="6.54">and we can see already within the</text>
  <text start="488.12" dur="6.269">economy things are starting to</text>
  <text start="490.91" dur="5.039">deteriorate very very quickly and I</text>
  <text start="494.389" dur="3.9">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they raised it</text>
  <text start="495.949" dur="3.901">once more and everything just implodes</text>
  <text start="498.289" dur="4.681">now they&amp;#39;re doing it very slowly because</text>
  <text start="499.85" dur="4.86">they don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for what is</text>
  <text start="502.97" dur="3.54">about to happen they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re raising the rates and a strong</text>
  <text start="506.51" dur="6.18">economy saying that this is helping the</text>
  <text start="509.15" dur="8.1">economy and so Jen&amp;#39;s strategist KITT</text>
  <text start="512.69" dur="7.17">drugs picks up where we left off whether</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="4.83">the Fed is raising too fast giving their</text>
  <text start="519.86" dur="5.94">inflation mandate or not they are</text>
  <text start="522.08" dur="6.09">raising them too slowly to contain asset</text>
  <text start="525.8" dur="4.2">price inflation so they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="528.17" dur="5.03">seeing it and they&amp;#39;re saying we have</text>
  <text start="530" dur="7.89">major problems here now we talked about</text>
  <text start="533.2" dur="6.88">the global credit impulse and UBS has</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="5.16">some very bad news for the global</text>
  <text start="540.08" dur="6.44">economy where they&amp;#39;re showing that the</text>
  <text start="543.05" dur="6.659">global credit impulse is collapsing and</text>
  <text start="546.52" dur="5.38">what does this mean well City is that</text>
  <text start="549.709" dur="5.671">they&amp;#39;re telling us why it&amp;#39;s so critical</text>
  <text start="551.9" dur="5.73">so Matt King is explaining and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.38" dur="5.22">focusing on the one thing that is wrong</text>
  <text start="557.63" dur="5.7">with this recovery the pervasive lack of</text>
  <text start="560.6" dur="4.98">global inflation so desired by the</text>
  <text start="563.33" dur="3.96">central banks now of course we know they</text>
  <text start="565.58" dur="4.89">took the inflation and they shoved it</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="4.77">off over to other countries they put it</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="3.84">into the stock market they put it into</text>
  <text start="572.06" dur="5.01">the housing bubble and this is how they</text>
  <text start="574.31" dur="4.59">moved inflation around they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="577.07" dur="3.99">the inflation shortfall isn&amp;#39;t new and</text>
  <text start="578.9" dur="4.92">yet the current level of credit growth</text>
  <text start="581.06" dur="6.51">would traditionally have seen inflation</text>
  <text start="583.82" dur="5.97">above 5% and while the central bank</text>
  <text start="587.57" dur="4.47">had limited success in stimulating</text>
  <text start="589.79" dur="5.97">inflation there was one obvious</text>
  <text start="592.04" dur="6.18">consequence credit fueled asset bubbles</text>
  <text start="595.76" dur="4.71">around the world this is where the</text>
  <text start="598.22" dur="5.01">credit impulse comes into play it allows</text>
  <text start="600.47" dur="4.86">market participants to track the</text>
  <text start="603.23" dur="4.29">instantaneous change in central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="605.33" dur="4.5">credit creation and more importantly the</text>
  <text start="607.52" dur="6.68">change in the flow of credit which</text>
  <text start="609.83" dur="6.78">drives GDP growth the impulse is also</text>
  <text start="614.2" dur="5.26">important as it directs investors</text>
  <text start="616.61" dur="5.73">behavior as well due to its correlation</text>
  <text start="619.46" dur="5.1">with asset prices City concludes we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="622.34" dur="5.49">just had the biggest surge in the</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="6">post-crisis error and yet the central</text>
  <text start="627.83" dur="4.68">bankers holy grail inflation remains low</text>
  <text start="630.56" dur="6.15">so what happens when the credit impulse</text>
  <text start="632.51" dur="8.73">turns negative well credit slows it</text>
  <text start="636.71" dur="9.6">freezes and we have a major disaster if</text>
  <text start="641.24" dur="8.55">we look back to 2007-2008 we had this is</text>
  <text start="646.31" dur="7.16">at the exact same thing happened credit</text>
  <text start="649.79" dur="7.02">froze up we&amp;#39;re at that point where</text>
  <text start="653.47" dur="5.41">credit is going to freeze up and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="656.81" dur="4.89">going to be a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="658.88" dur="5.37">now we have been looking at many</text>
  <text start="661.7" dur="6.39">different indicators letting us know</text>
  <text start="664.25" dur="6.03">that this economy well it is in a deep</text>
  <text start="668.09" dur="5.28">recession right now and we&amp;#39;re heading to</text>
  <text start="670.28" dur="6.78">this major collapse scenario which is</text>
  <text start="673.37" dur="7.41">going to be horrific and we talked about</text>
  <text start="677.06" dur="6.3">the yield curve and the difference in</text>
  <text start="680.78" dur="4.92">yield between Treasuries do in five</text>
  <text start="683.36" dur="6.48">years and those maturing in three</text>
  <text start="685.7" dur="6.9">decades tumbled today as low as 96 basis</text>
  <text start="689.84" dur="7.11">points this morning the narrowest since</text>
  <text start="692.6" dur="8.04">December of 2007 the last two times the</text>
  <text start="696.95" dur="6.75">US yield curve was this flat the US</text>
  <text start="700.64" dur="8.16">economy officially entered a recession</text>
  <text start="703.7" dur="7.14">and guess what we are right there the</text>
  <text start="708.8" dur="3.75">five-year Treasury notes are among the</text>
  <text start="710.84" dur="4.5">most sensitive to the Fed policy outlook</text>
  <text start="712.55" dur="4.53">but it appears the yield curve is not</text>
  <text start="715.34" dur="5.6">just falling for the feds growth</text>
  <text start="717.08" dur="5.9">high-pitch and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="720.94" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re hiking the interest rates and we</text>
  <text start="722.98" dur="6.05">see a decline we see the yields decline</text>
  <text start="725.89" dur="7.53">this has gone on throughout the year of</text>
  <text start="729.03" dur="7.39">2016 into 2017 when we look we can see</text>
  <text start="733.42" dur="6.63">that every time they increased the</text>
  <text start="736.42" dur="9.03">interest rates a bit the Fed rate we see</text>
  <text start="740.05" dur="7.35">the yield continually drop drop drop and</text>
  <text start="745.45" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="747.4" dur="6.3">going back to 2007 to 2008</text>
  <text start="751.15" dur="5.76">so everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="753.7" dur="6.12">now we have seen before this is nothing</text>
  <text start="756.91" dur="6">new it&amp;#39;s not different this time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="759.82" dur="5.91">exactly the same they&amp;#39;re using the same</text>
  <text start="762.91" dur="7.95">exact formula to bring the economy down</text>
  <text start="765.73" dur="7.53">this time as they did back in 2007-2008</text>
  <text start="770.86" dur="5.19">and I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re predicting no</text>
  <text start="773.26" dur="5.22">recession I&amp;#39;m sure they don&amp;#39;t even see</text>
  <text start="776.05" dur="5.4">anything happening there are no bubbles</text>
  <text start="778.48" dur="7.23">it&amp;#39;s the same exact excuses they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="781.45" dur="7.41">using forever they say the same things</text>
  <text start="785.71" dur="6">over and over and over but we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="788.86" dur="3.99">past that we&amp;#39;re looking at exactly what</text>
  <text start="791.71" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re doing we&amp;#39;re looking at their</text>
  <text start="792.85" dur="6.06">formula and we can see exactly what</text>
  <text start="796.03" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re doing this is not going to be a</text>
  <text start="798.91" dur="5.22">small little recession this is not going</text>
  <text start="801.37" dur="6.36">to be a depression this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="804.13" dur="7.41">collapse like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="807.73" dur="5.55">why because we&amp;#39;d never recovered this</text>
  <text start="811.54" dur="6.45">will all come out later like it always</text>
  <text start="813.28" dur="7.98">does the economy never recovered from</text>
  <text start="817.99" dur="6.69">2008 they just covered everything up</text>
  <text start="821.26" dur="6.93">it&amp;#39;s like a household where they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="824.68" dur="6.36">so much debt their income continually</text>
  <text start="828.19" dur="6.33">drops and they take out a credit card</text>
  <text start="831.04" dur="5.94">for $50,000 and they say everything is</text>
  <text start="834.52" dur="6.9">fine and that lasts for about four years</text>
  <text start="836.98" dur="7.05">until all of a sudden things start</text>
  <text start="841.42" dur="5.61">rapidly falling apart and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="844.03" dur="5.85">have anymore credit to get more to get</text>
  <text start="847.03" dur="5.96">another credit card their income hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="849.88" dur="4.8">increased they have a lot more debt and</text>
  <text start="852.99" dur="4.36">everything starts to break</text>
  <text start="854.68" dur="5.37">down and guess what they have to do what</text>
  <text start="857.35" dur="4.5">they have to go bankrupt this is what</text>
  <text start="860.05" dur="6.81">we&amp;#39;re seeing in the economy right now</text>
  <text start="861.85" dur="8.16">and when we hit that point where the</text>
  <text start="866.86" dur="6.27">entire system falls apart everyone is</text>
  <text start="870.01" dur="5.94">going to realize what just happened and</text>
  <text start="873.13" dur="5.37">for a lot of people it&amp;#39;s going to be too</text>
  <text start="875.95" dur="6.03">late but for those people who have been</text>
  <text start="878.5" dur="4.8">preparing you will be ready for what is</text>
  <text start="881.98" dur="3.96">about to happen</text>
  <text start="883.3" dur="5.34">figure out all those people if they knew</text>
  <text start="885.94" dur="4.38">what was going to happen in 2008 instead</text>
  <text start="888.64" dur="2.699">of riding these bubbles and thinking</text>
  <text start="890.32" dur="3.09">that everything was going to be great</text>
  <text start="891.339" dur="5.431">and adding on another house to their</text>
  <text start="893.41" dur="5.79">other six houses that they had we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="896.77" dur="4.59">thinking like oh I might lose my job</text>
  <text start="899.2" dur="5.699">maybe I should invest in gold and silver</text>
  <text start="901.36" dur="6.75">or put some cash away maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="904.899" dur="7.651">purchase that expensive home think about</text>
  <text start="908.11" dur="6.599">it because last time it hit what 38</text>
  <text start="912.55" dur="5.909">percent of the population this time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="914.709" dur="6.151">going to hit the rest and this is why</text>
  <text start="918.459" dur="5.161">everyone needs to be ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="920.86" dur="3.93">for what this hits because it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="923.62" dur="3.63">going to be something where you say oh</text>
  <text start="924.79" dur="4.049">alright I lost my job I&amp;#39;ll just find</text>
  <text start="927.25" dur="3.089">another one what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="928.839" dur="3.361">you&amp;#39;re going to lose your job and</text>
  <text start="930.339" dur="5.491">everyone around you is going to lose</text>
  <text start="932.2" dur="4.95">their job which means everyone then will</text>
  <text start="935.83" dur="4.199">not be able to pay their mortgage or</text>
  <text start="937.15" dur="4.559">their rent which means we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="940.029" dur="3.631">see a lot more real estate come onto the</text>
  <text start="941.709" dur="3.781">market which means housing prices are</text>
  <text start="943.66" dur="4.2">going to fall we&amp;#39;re going to see stock</text>
  <text start="945.49" dur="3.719">market bubbles collapse retail is going</text>
  <text start="947.86" dur="4.11">to collapse like you&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="949.209" dur="3.931">before because now people are definitely</text>
  <text start="951.97" dur="3.9">not going to go out and purchase and</text>
  <text start="953.14" dur="4.88">this is going to be a domino effect it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="955.87" dur="4.95">going to hit one sector after another</text>
  <text start="958.02" dur="6.18">before all the sectors are completely</text>
  <text start="960.82" dur="5.94">dead and there&amp;#39;s nothing else to do</text>
  <text start="964.2" dur="4.12">except restart the system but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="966.76" dur="3.78">not just going to say hey let&amp;#39;s restart</text>
  <text start="968.32" dur="4.53">the system they&amp;#39;re going to tell you</text>
  <text start="970.54" dur="4.19">that everything&amp;#39;s going to be fine we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="972.85" dur="4.799">going to start stimulus up once again</text>
  <text start="974.73" dur="4.359">don&amp;#39;t worry about it and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="977.649" dur="4.44">to pretend that the economy is improving</text>
  <text start="979.089" dur="4.471">once again and what they&amp;#39;re going to end</text>
  <text start="982.089" dur="4.771">up doing is they&amp;#39;re going to have this</text>
  <text start="983.56" dur="5.01">event why they are telling us that the</text>
  <text start="986.86" dur="3.81">economy is doing well is</text>
  <text start="988.57" dur="3.66">then we&amp;#39;ll hit most likely will be a</text>
  <text start="990.67" dur="3.45">cyberattack Oh hit the financial</text>
  <text start="992.23" dur="4.35">institutions and they&amp;#39;ll say because of</text>
  <text start="994.12" dur="4.65">that that&amp;#39;s why the economy fell apart</text>
  <text start="996.58" dur="5.1">not because of what we did we were</text>
  <text start="998.77" dur="5.94">trying to help it Trump wrote it down in</text>
  <text start="1001.68" dur="5.88">the beginning we brought it back up but</text>
