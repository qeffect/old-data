  <text start="129.459" dur="4.53">that the United States they are</text>
  <text start="131.739" dur="5.371">preparing for a hard brexit which means</text>
  <text start="133.989" dur="5.61">a No Deal I think that point is going to</text>
  <text start="137.11" dur="4.56">come with it with the people of the UK</text>
  <text start="139.599" dur="5.101">say you know something we&amp;#39;re done here</text>
  <text start="141.67" dur="6.569">we see Nigel Farraj he&amp;#39;s pushing this</text>
  <text start="144.7" dur="5.22">entire movement to have a No Deal and it</text>
  <text start="148.239" dur="5.551">looks like we might be heading in that</text>
  <text start="149.92" dur="8.399">direction and we know that the central</text>
  <text start="153.79" dur="8.4">bankers once they lose one country once</text>
  <text start="158.319" dur="5.311">they lose control this is when they are</text>
  <text start="162.19" dur="4.17">exposed</text>
  <text start="163.63" dur="4.59">and this is their worst fear this is why</text>
  <text start="166.36" dur="3.57">they have events to cover up their</text>
  <text start="168.22" dur="4.29">entire system imploding on itself</text>
  <text start="169.93" dur="5.64">because they don&amp;#39;t want the world to</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="5.82">know that we would do a lot better</text>
  <text start="175.57" dur="6.15">without them and there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="178.33" dur="5.7">evidence that shows how bad the central</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="3.96">bankers are to the people of the world</text>
  <text start="184.03" dur="4.74">if we look at the United States for</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="5.91">example government officials have been</text>
  <text start="188.77" dur="5.31">pushing to increase the minimum wage and</text>
  <text start="191.59" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;ve been saying yes we need to raise</text>
  <text start="194.08" dur="4.59">the minimum wage it has to be done we</text>
  <text start="196.63" dur="4.71">need it up to fifteen dollars this way</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="4.65">everyone will be better off now I</text>
  <text start="201.34" dur="4.29">remember way way back when I first</text>
  <text start="203.32" dur="4.74">started working at a supermarket I was</text>
  <text start="205.63" dur="5.61">making three dollars and 35 cents that</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="7.41">was the minimum wage now here we are</text>
  <text start="211.24" dur="6.75">today they&amp;#39;re pushing for $15 do you</text>
  <text start="215.47" dur="6.33">really think that this is going to</text>
  <text start="217.99" dur="7.65">really help people or do we need to go</text>
  <text start="221.8" dur="6.9">to the source of the problem why did we</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="6.48">go from 3 dollars and 35 cents all the</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="6.6">way up to 15 because the value of the</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="6.54">dollar decreased over this period of</text>
  <text start="235.3" dur="6.99">time I&amp;#39;m where where what&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s the central bank now since they</text>
  <text start="242.29" dur="3.92">started to raise the minimum wage look</text>
  <text start="244.99" dur="4.11">what has happened</text>
  <text start="246.21" dur="5.32">small businesses are being forced to lay</text>
  <text start="249.1" dur="4.29">off workers in order to comply with the</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="4.26">law demanding an increase in wages and</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="4.71">what about those people that were</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="5.79">working who still have the job will they</text>
  <text start="258.1" dur="6.75">cut those people&amp;#39;s hours and a lot of</text>
  <text start="261.58" dur="6.36">the small businesses they&amp;#39;re going out</text>
  <text start="264.85" dur="4.8">of business they can&amp;#39;t afford it I mean</text>
  <text start="267.94" dur="4.35">similar effects were also seen after</text>
  <text start="269.65" dur="5.19">employers were dictated to comply with</text>
  <text start="272.29" dur="4.68">Obamacare instead of giving full-time</text>
  <text start="274.84" dur="6.15">employees health insurance what do they</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="5.73">do they cut them down to part-time every</text>
  <text start="280.99" dur="4.83">time that government or the central bank</text>
  <text start="282.7" dur="6.38">gets involved guess what happens</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="7.22">businesses react in the opposite way</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="7.609">because we shouldn&amp;#39;t be dictating and</text>
  <text start="293.04" dur="5.999">creating rules for businesses</text>
  <text start="296.689" dur="5.35">businesses should be operating in an</text>
  <text start="299.039" dur="5.791">open free market allowing them to do</text>
  <text start="302.039" dur="5.37">what they do best make a profit hire</text>
  <text start="304.83" dur="5.669">more people make a profit hire more</text>
  <text start="307.409" dur="6.63">people make more money then they can pay</text>
  <text start="310.499" dur="5.19">the people a higher salary instead the</text>
  <text start="314.039" dur="3.3">government is just saying listen we</text>
  <text start="315.689" dur="3.421">don&amp;#39;t care what your profits are you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.339" dur="6.241">gonna pay these people this much money</text>
  <text start="319.11" dur="6.419">and look what happens they lose work so</text>
  <text start="323.58" dur="4.799">really all of this comes back to what</text>
  <text start="325.529" dur="5.97">the central bank the central bank system</text>
  <text start="328.379" dur="6.9">that were in today does not work with</text>
  <text start="331.499" dur="6.75">the people at all that again is the</text>
  <text start="335.279" dur="6.57">source of the problem it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="338.249" dur="5.67">problem we&amp;#39;ve been having and we need to</text>
  <text start="341.849" dur="4.771">get rid of the central bank to make</text>
  <text start="343.919" dur="4.49">things a lot better now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="346.62" dur="6.269">interesting is that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="348.409" dur="6.85">they are following what the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="352.889" dur="4.92">telling them to do do not raise interest</text>
  <text start="355.259" dur="4.351">rates in 2019 so guess what there are no</text>
  <text start="357.809" dur="4.89">interest rates that are going to be</text>
  <text start="359.61" dur="5.76">increased in the year of 2019 and we</text>
  <text start="362.699" dur="5.071">know that other central banks well they</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="6.21">don&amp;#39;t do things without the Federal</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="5.989">Reserve so the ECB right now what are</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="5.129">they doing are they raising rates no</text>
  <text start="373.759" dur="5.921">they decided that they&amp;#39;re going to keep</text>
  <text start="376.709" dur="4.26">their policy unchanged no changes to</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="3.12">rates we&amp;#39;re just gonna keep them where</text>
  <text start="380.969" dur="3.06">they are and that&amp;#39;s that hmm I wonder</text>
  <text start="382.8" dur="3.479">what the Fed is doing oh that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="384.029" dur="4.591">there keep them exactly where they are</text>
  <text start="386.279" dur="6">now remember Trump has been calling on</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="5.729">the Fed to lower the rates why because</text>
  <text start="392.279" dur="4.62">he needs to keep the system going long</text>
  <text start="394.349" dur="4.8">enough to have the next election and</text>
  <text start="396.899" dur="4.08">then after the election I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="399.149" dur="4.77">think he cares I think he&amp;#39;s gonna go</text>
  <text start="400.979" dur="4.83">right for the central bank and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="403.919" dur="5.49">gonna go after them with everything that</text>
  <text start="405.809" dur="5.64">he has and we see that there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="409.409" dur="4.56">with the Federal Reserve with them</text>
  <text start="411.449" dur="4.5">managing interest rates it is attracting</text>
  <text start="413.969" dur="4.891">new bank entrance but the Federal</text>
  <text start="415.949" dur="4.2">Reserve does not want their business so</text>
  <text start="418.86" dur="4.079">to fix this problem</text>
  <text start="420.149" dur="5.281">it has proposed rule changes that govern</text>
  <text start="422.939" dur="4.801">the way it pays bank&amp;#39;s interest on</text>
  <text start="425.43" dur="3.87">reserves now the plan would allow it to</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="2.13">pay different banks different rates on</text>
  <text start="429.3" dur="3.21">reserves</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="5.25">including a rate of 0% the Federal</text>
  <text start="432.51" dur="4.59">Reserve would choose which banks qualify</text>
  <text start="435.12" dur="4.59">for a high rate which qualify for a low</text>
  <text start="437.1" dur="4.32">rate and which will earn nothing these</text>
  <text start="439.71" dur="4.89">changes would give the Federal Reserve a</text>
  <text start="441.42" dur="5.64">new dangerous power to use interest on</text>
  <text start="444.6" dur="5.01">reserves to choose winners and losers</text>
  <text start="447.06" dur="5.49">including blocking new bank entrants it</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="4.11">deems problematic in 2006 when Congress</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="3.84">gave the Federal Reserve authority to</text>
  <text start="453.72" dur="5.19">pay bank interest on reserves it never</text>
  <text start="456.39" dur="4.53">imagined the Federal Reserve would use</text>
  <text start="458.91" dur="4.73">the authority to pay favored banks</text>
  <text start="460.92" dur="6.63">higher interest rates on their reserves</text>
  <text start="463.64" dur="6.58">Congress needs to revisit this entire</text>
  <text start="467.55" dur="5.25">thing remember yesterday in the report</text>
  <text start="470.22" dur="5.03">we said that Congress has completely</text>
  <text start="472.8" dur="5.07">lost control of the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="5.17">Trump and the Patriots they are</text>
  <text start="477.87" dur="5.19">controlling the Federal Reserve and the</text>
  <text start="480.42" dur="6.72">Federal Reserve is listening to the</text>
  <text start="483.06" dur="7.64">Patriots now because remember as soon as</text>
  <text start="487.14" dur="6.63">Q told us that they have the problem</text>
  <text start="490.7" dur="5.71">handled with the Federal Reserve raising</text>
  <text start="493.77" dur="4.47">interest rates in the year of 2019 guess</text>
  <text start="496.41" dur="3.87">what happened all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="498.24" dur="3.33">Federal Reserve said you know something</text>
  <text start="500.28" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re gonna be in a holding pattern</text>
  <text start="501.57" dur="6.11">right now now Trump is calling on the</text>
  <text start="503.82" dur="7.92">Federal Reserve to lower rates it would</text>
  <text start="507.68" dur="6.73">guess that by the end of this year we</text>
  <text start="511.74" dur="5.85">might see the Federal Reserve lower</text>
  <text start="514.41" dur="4.92">rates now remember the deep state and</text>
  <text start="517.59" dur="4.17">the central bank&amp;#39;s plan was to bring</text>
  <text start="519.33" dur="4.44">down the economy and blame this on Trump</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="3.06">they were gonna do this during the 2020</text>
  <text start="523.77" dur="3.87">election because this would help the</text>
  <text start="524.82" dur="7.17">deep state also and this way it would</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="7.32">explain why the entire world was</text>
  <text start="531.99" dur="5.85">crashing remember the central banks are</text>
  <text start="534.96" dur="5.13">exposed right now they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="537.84" dur="6.33">world to know that they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="540.09" dur="5.88">created this problem and now there have</text>
  <text start="544.17" dur="3.57">a bigger problem because now the</text>
  <text start="545.97" dur="5.19">Patriots are in control the Federal</text>
  <text start="547.74" dur="5.4">Reserve and what do the central banks</text>
  <text start="551.16" dur="3.45">around the world do they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="553.14" dur="3.84">anything they&amp;#39;re in a holding pattern</text>
  <text start="554.61" dur="4.62">and they&amp;#39;re still saying well it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="556.98" dur="4.32">tariffs that&amp;#39;s the problem the tariffs</text>
  <text start="559.23" dur="3.089">are the thing that&amp;#39;s making the entire</text>
  <text start="561.3" dur="3.749">world</text>
  <text start="562.319" dur="7.02">no that&amp;#39;s not the problem the entire</text>
  <text start="565.049" dur="6.72">world was slowing way before Trump but</text>
  <text start="569.339" dur="4.44">the mainstream media the IMF and the</text>
  <text start="571.769" dur="2.28">rest kept on saying no everything is</text>
  <text start="573.779" dur="3.12">fine</text>
  <text start="574.049" dur="6.54">look it&amp;#39;s fantastic think about it the</text>
  <text start="576.899" dur="5.58">IMF came out during Obama&amp;#39;s term telling</text>
  <text start="580.589" dur="4.14">us that we&amp;#39;re gonna hit four percent or</text>
  <text start="582.479" dur="5.4">three and a half percent GDP and then</text>
  <text start="584.729" dur="5">every month leading up to when they were</text>
  <text start="587.879" dur="4.02">supposed to announce the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="589.729" dur="4.42">they lowered it they lowered it they</text>
  <text start="591.899" dur="4.201">lowered it they lowered it if you look</text>
  <text start="594.149" dur="4.23">at the European countries they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="596.1" dur="5.399">improved why do you think the central</text>
  <text start="598.379" dur="4.531">banks around the world lowered interest</text>
  <text start="601.499" dur="4.17">rates is that because the economy was</text>
  <text start="602.91" dur="4.049">doing fantastically well no they lowered</text>
  <text start="605.669" dur="3.6">the interest rates because they knew</text>
  <text start="606.959" dur="3.951">that there was too much debt if they</text>
  <text start="609.269" dur="4.59">kept the interest rates where they were</text>
  <text start="610.91" dur="6.579">every single country would implode and</text>
  <text start="613.859" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s not the central bank&amp;#39;s plan the</text>
  <text start="617.489" dur="4.53">central bank&amp;#39;s plan is to keep countries</text>
  <text start="619.289" dur="4.59">in limbo to keep them on the hook for</text>
  <text start="622.019" dur="3.93">the debt and having them pay the debt</text>
  <text start="623.879" dur="3.42">and have this middle ground they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="625.949" dur="2.37">want them to go down because then</text>
  <text start="627.299" dur="2.431">everyone would say wait a minute</text>
  <text start="628.319" dur="4.29">the central bank was managing the</text>
  <text start="629.73" dur="5.039">economy and the entire country just fell</text>
  <text start="632.609" dur="4.98">apart I mean that wouldn&amp;#39;t look good for</text>
  <text start="634.769" dur="3.451">them and this is their biggest fear</text>
  <text start="637.589" dur="4.381">right now</text>
  <text start="638.22" dur="6.51">they they don&amp;#39;t have control of what&amp;#39;s</text>
