  <text start="160.61" dur="5.57">billions of dollars without this</text>
  <text start="163.69" dur="5.16">most of these companies would be in a</text>
  <text start="166.18" dur="7.02">huge amount of trouble right now and as</text>
  <text start="168.85" dur="6.63">we can see moving into this new year</text>
  <text start="173.2" dur="5.52">this holiday season right now is a</text>
  <text start="175.48" dur="5.51">complete disaster now some information</text>
  <text start="178.72" dur="6.27">came out today that personal spending</text>
  <text start="180.99" dur="5.86">has risen by 0.3% in November in line</text>
  <text start="184.99" dur="4.35">with expectations and up from a point</text>
  <text start="186.85" dur="7.47">one percent increase the month before</text>
  <text start="189.34" dur="8.64">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that people are</text>
  <text start="194.32" dur="5.16">not saving people are spending but we</text>
  <text start="197.98" dur="3.96">have to look closely at where this is</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="7.2">coming from and when we look closely at</text>
  <text start="201.94" dur="8.81">this we see that the spending is coming</text>
  <text start="206.68" dur="8.34">from wage increases the spending is</text>
  <text start="210.75" dur="8.14">coming from a twenty 20 billion service</text>
  <text start="215.02" dur="9.09">producing industry three billion is</text>
  <text start="218.89" dur="8.24">coming from government and our people</text>
  <text start="224.11" dur="7.32">actually spending more no actually</text>
  <text start="227.13" dur="7.09">consumer spending is declining not</text>
  <text start="231.43" dur="7.04">improving whatsoever but where people</text>
  <text start="234.22" dur="7.019">are spending is basically eating out</text>
  <text start="238.47" dur="5.8">we&amp;#39;re seeing an increase of about four</text>
  <text start="241.239" dur="5.851">point six percent and normally this</text>
  <text start="244.27" dur="4.31">occurs when the economy starts to fall</text>
  <text start="247.09" dur="4.38">apart and we&amp;#39;ve seen this in the past</text>
  <text start="248.58" dur="4.81">leading up to a complete collapse</text>
  <text start="251.47" dur="4.71">because people say okay I don&amp;#39;t eat that</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="5.76">product I don&amp;#39;t have money for that but</text>
  <text start="256.18" dur="5.339">I do have to feed myself so I can</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="4.13">justify going out to eat and this is</text>
  <text start="261.519" dur="4.711">where I&amp;#39;ll spend my money right now and</text>
  <text start="263.28" dur="6.82">eventually what happens this also then</text>
  <text start="266.23" dur="8.43">falls apart but we know that the people</text>
  <text start="270.1" dur="8.48">in the United States here this holiday</text>
  <text start="274.66" dur="7.11">season they are not spending their money</text>

  <text start="297.01" dur="2.82">drop</text>
  <text start="297.43" dur="5.06">in sales and they&amp;#39;re saying as they go</text>
  <text start="299.83" dur="4.83">forward it&amp;#39;s going to get worse during</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="5.5">coming towards the end of this holiday</text>

  <text start="335.62" dur="4.56">going to lose their jobs in retail we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="340.18" dur="5.01">you know something we need to cut costs</text>
  <text start="342.34" dur="5.49">we need to let people go because as we</text>
  <text start="345.19" dur="7.59">know as this economy continually falls</text>
  <text start="347.83" dur="7.68">apart sales are declining revenue is not</text>
  <text start="352.78" dur="5.64">coming in and if not if this is not</text>
  <text start="355.51" dur="5.75">happening guess what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="358.42" dur="5.85">let people go and we have been seen this</text>
  <text start="361.26" dur="6.7">all throughout this year and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="364.27" dur="6.26">to accelerate coming in 2016 now the</text>
  <text start="367.96" dur="6.75">continually trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="6.19">housing is really recovering but we just</text>
  <text start="374.71" dur="3.93">saw the existing home sales they&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="376.72" dur="3.72">by ten percent now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.64" dur="3.78">saying well new home sales oh my god</text>
  <text start="380.44" dur="4.92">these are doing fantastic everything</text>
  <text start="382.42" dur="6.69">looks great but when we really look at</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="6.87">this and we look back in 2014 the period</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="7.41">made to November the initial new home</text>
  <text start="392.23" dur="11.13">sales prints amounts to 2.7 79 million</text>
  <text start="396.52" dur="11.45">houses a post revision the number</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="6.99">plunged to twenty-two percent to 2.16</text>
  <text start="407.97" dur="4.69">instead of what they were recording so</text>
  <text start="410.35" dur="4.44">what they did is they went back and they</text>
  <text start="412.66" dur="5.1">revised older numbers and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.79" dur="7.52">twenty-two percent lower than what they</text>
  <text start="417.76" dur="7.71">initially told us this was back in 2014</text>
  <text start="422.31" dur="7.36">so housing isn&amp;#39;t doing as well as they</text>
  <text start="425.47" dur="4.95">said so let&amp;#39;s fast-forward to today when</text>
  <text start="429.67" dur="2.73">the depart</text>
  <text start="430.42" dur="3.99">commerce plans pleasantly surprised</text>
  <text start="432.4" dur="3.93">everyone when it reported that November</text>
  <text start="434.41" dur="3.72">new home sales while missing</text>
  <text start="436.33" dur="5.93">expectations of about five hundred and</text>
  <text start="438.13" dur="7.47">five thousand rows to 490,000 from</text>
  <text start="442.26" dur="5.62">470,000 in October sounds great the</text>
  <text start="445.6" dur="5.49">housing recovery it&amp;#39;s completely on</text>
  <text start="447.88" dur="6.93">track there&amp;#39;s only one problem the</text>
  <text start="451.09" dur="6.57">original October print of 495 thousand</text>
  <text start="454.81" dur="7.44">which if maintained would have meant a</text>
  <text start="457.66" dur="6.87">decline of 5,000 in November not only</text>
  <text start="462.25" dur="4.5">were there downward revisions between</text>
  <text start="464.53" dur="5.58">the November and October on the</text>
  <text start="466.75" dur="5.88">government data but as the chart that</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="5.7">I&amp;#39;m looking at shows over the past five</text>
  <text start="472.63" dur="6.36">months that data has been consistently</text>
  <text start="475.81" dur="8.49">revised lower with every incremental</text>
  <text start="478.99" dur="7.44">release so basically the line they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="3.69">telling us yes these are the housing</text>
  <text start="486.43" dur="3.72">sales and then they&amp;#39;re going back and</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="4.08">lowering them dramatically and you can</text>
  <text start="490.15" dur="3.6">see this chart on the Xfinity report com</text>
  <text start="492.07" dur="4.38">or if on YouTube you can see it on</text>
  <text start="493.75" dur="6.65">youtube so you can see that this</text>
  <text start="496.45" dur="7.47">information that they&amp;#39;re giving us</text>
  <text start="500.4" dur="7.84">they&amp;#39;re going back and lowering it to</text>
  <text start="503.92" dur="6.69">the real statistical numbers but they</text>
  <text start="508.24" dur="6.42">don&amp;#39;t tell anyone that so everyone</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="6.48">believes that everything is fine so what</text>
  <text start="514.66" dur="7.02">are we seeing now we&amp;#39;re seeing home</text>
  <text start="517.09" dur="7.65">builder optimism now in decline existing</text>
  <text start="521.68" dur="5.13">home sales completely falling and they</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="6.24">try to convince us that new home sales</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="6.87">are increasing well they manipulated the</text>
  <text start="530.98" dur="6.36">data if we remove what they&amp;#39;ve done it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="533.68" dur="8.04">in decline so everything is declining</text>
  <text start="537.34" dur="7.94">now and housing prices are flat line and</text>
  <text start="541.72" dur="9.84">coming down at this point the entire</text>
  <text start="545.28" dur="9.52">system is one gigantic illusion let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="551.56" dur="8.58">look at durable goods here they have</text>
  <text start="554.8" dur="7.2">plunged for ten consecutive months the</text>
  <text start="560.14" dur="3.35">only thing that lifted durable goods was</text>
  <text start="562" dur="5.4">the defense spin</text>
  <text start="563.49" dur="5.8">because as we know the US government</text>
  <text start="567.4" dur="6.53">central bankers are pushing more in the</text>
  <text start="569.29" dur="8.67">Middle East in Europe in the Pacific and</text>
  <text start="573.93" dur="6.76">defense spending pushed durable goods up</text>
  <text start="577.96" dur="6.99">if we strip that out what do we see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.69" dur="8.61">a complete disaster with defense</text>
  <text start="584.95" dur="7.5">spending in their new order sword 148</text>
  <text start="589.3" dur="6.39">percent the biggest rise since 2007 if</text>
  <text start="592.45" dur="8.37">we remove all that the economy is an</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="9.18">utter disaster flashing a depression the</text>
  <text start="600.82" dur="7.19">Atlanta Fed came out and they have said</text>
  <text start="604.87" dur="6.3">we need to revise the fourth quarter GDP</text>
  <text start="608.01" dur="6.58">now it is at one point three they</text>
  <text start="611.17" dur="4.98">started at if you remember three percent</text>
  <text start="614.59" dur="3.15">they brought it down to two point five</text>
  <text start="616.15" dur="3.63">percent they brought it down to one</text>
  <text start="617.74" dur="3.27">point nine percent we are now at one</text>
  <text start="619.78" dur="4.02">point three percent but you have to</text>
  <text start="621.01" dur="5.25">remember they stuff a lot of other</text>
  <text start="623.8" dur="5.28">things in the GDP research and</text>

  <text start="636.61" dur="6.51">continually being lowered and lowered</text>

  <text start="696.07" dur="3.72">to tumble now</text>
  <text start="697.27" dur="5.43">at a 10-year low that&amp;#39;s because mills</text>
