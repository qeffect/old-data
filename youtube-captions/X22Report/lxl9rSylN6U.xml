  <text start="99.99" dur="4.95">financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="5.161">about how all the wealth has flowed up</text>
  <text start="104.94" dur="5.039">to the 1% and at this point I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="5.13">think people really understand how bad</text>
  <text start="109.979" dur="5.25">this is because when we look at the</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="5.849">situation we see three Americans they</text>
  <text start="115.229" dur="8.761">possess more wealth than 50 percent of</text>
  <text start="118.619" dur="8.491">the combined poorest we have now learned</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="5.969">that 20% of all Americans have zero or</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="5.04">negative wealth and what is negative</text>
  <text start="129.959" dur="3.75">wealth mean well they have lived beyond</text>
  <text start="132.15" dur="3.27">their means for so long their debt</text>
  <text start="133.709" dur="5.671">burden is all they have to show for</text>
  <text start="135.42" dur="6.69">their life and all of this is because of</text>
  <text start="139.38" dur="5.76">yes the Federal Reserve the Federal</text>
  <text start="142.11" dur="6.41">Reserve System that operates through the</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="6.54">US Treasury is to blame for all of this</text>
  <text start="148.52" dur="6.04">without this Federal Reserve mechanism</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="5.85">of wealth transference the current</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="4.95">wealth imbalance would not exist it</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="4.05">would be almost impossible to have the</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="5.19">number of millionaires and billionaires</text>
  <text start="161.58" dur="5.1">that are roaming the earth today these</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="3.96">people would still be wealthy but their</text>
  <text start="166.68" dur="4.8">wealth wouldn&amp;#39;t be completely out of</text>
  <text start="168.66" dur="5.4">balance with the mass of the people now</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="4.44">right now one in five households has</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="3.45">zero or a negative wealth according to a</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="4.56">report released this week by the</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="4.56">Institute of policy studies this is a</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="5.46">progressive think tank based in</text>
  <text start="182.07" dur="4.56">Washington DC now as of right now US</text>
  <text start="185.94" dur="2.9">homes the</text>
  <text start="186.63" dur="5.4">gained value since the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="188.84" dur="6.79">but many households have not now</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="5.64">remember they have these 20 cities where</text>
  <text start="195.63" dur="4.26">they pumped up the bubbles they kept</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="3.87">houses off the market they have hedge</text>
  <text start="199.89" dur="3.75">funds come in investment companies</text>
  <text start="201.54" dur="4.05">foreign buyers come in purchase these</text>
  <text start="203.64" dur="4.95">homes and they tell them to hold on to</text>
  <text start="205.59" dur="4.86">it banks are instructed not to release</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="3.57">the foreclosed home let the people live</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="3.84">there let them take care of the lawns</text>
  <text start="212.16" dur="3.9">and don&amp;#39;t put them out in the market in</text>
  <text start="214.29" dur="4.32">this way they can push the prices up and</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="5.55">again this is part of the entire</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="6.24">illusion now millions of American</text>
  <text start="221.61" dur="5.22">families they struggle with zero or</text>
  <text start="224.85" dur="4.2">negative wealth meaning they owe more</text>
  <text start="226.83" dur="4.8">than they own this is what the report</text>
  <text start="229.05" dur="4.77">found this means that they have nothing</text>
  <text start="231.63" dur="5.4">to fall back on if an unexpected expense</text>
  <text start="233.82" dur="8.34">comes up like a broken-down car or an</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="7.86">illness and we see that once again the</text>
  <text start="242.16" dur="4.77">actual people who have gone through the</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="5.24">financial crisis many of them lost their</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="6.57">jobs many of them lost their homes and</text>
  <text start="250.13" dur="5.74">they never really recovered and I know</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="3.9">many people out there who write in</text>
  <text start="255.87" dur="4.59">saying that yes this has happened to</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="5.94">them I know a lot of people here where I</text>
  <text start="260.46" dur="5.28">am where they are still underwater in</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="5.22">their homes they bought at the height of</text>
  <text start="265.74" dur="4.59">the market and their houses have never</text>
  <text start="268.56" dur="5.49">reached that point so their mortgages</text>
  <text start="270.33" dur="6.66">are much higher than what the house is</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="4.8">really worth now the mainstream media I</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="3.24">mean they&amp;#39;re not out there telling</text>
  <text start="278.85" dur="3.54">everyone this they&amp;#39;re telling everyone</text>
  <text start="280.23" dur="5.01">that everything is great the value of</text>
  <text start="282.39" dur="4.73">homes they are they have regained all</text>
  <text start="285.24" dur="4.71">their values since the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="287.12" dur="5.5">there&amp;#39;s hardly any inflation and</text>
  <text start="289.95" dur="4.98">everything looks great everyone is happy</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="3.54">and retail is fine yes we have a problem</text>
  <text start="294.93" dur="3.24">with brick and mortar but that&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="4.17">if it&amp;#39;s all going to online and you</text>
  <text start="298.17" dur="3.93">shouldn&amp;#39;t really worry about this and we</text>
  <text start="300.33" dur="4.38">could see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.1" dur="5.73">covering up what is really going on in</text>
  <text start="304.71" dur="4.71">this country and people recognize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="3.68">going on in this country and they</text>
  <text start="309.42" dur="6.18">understand that yeah there are no</text>
  <text start="311.51" dur="6.61">high-paying jobs there are no there is</text>
  <text start="315.6" dur="4.32">no manufacturing in this country yes</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s still manufacturing but not</text>
  <text start="319.92" dur="6.3">like it was back in the 40s the 50s the</text>
  <text start="323.43" dur="5.94">60s it is all gone this was done on</text>
  <text start="326.22" dur="5.4">purpose it was shipped over to China and</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="4.53">other Asian nations because the central</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="4.29">bankers knew at this time that the</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="4.17">dollar the petro dollar system would</text>
  <text start="335.91" dur="3.45">only last for you know a certain period</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="3.27">of time and they started to take</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="3.87">precautions to move their entire system</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="3.99">someplace else and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="343.23" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ve done and we&amp;#39;ve been watching and</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="4.53">tracking the economy fall apart ever</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="4.29">since we see existing home sales they</text>
  <text start="349.86" dur="3.9">drop year over year this is the second</text>
  <text start="351.84" dur="5.25">straight month in a row the first time</text>
  <text start="353.76" dur="5.88">since 2014 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="357.09" dur="5.58">now and it&amp;#39;s being reported that the</text>
  <text start="359.64" dur="6.23">yield curve is flattening now the yield</text>
  <text start="362.67" dur="7.05">spread collapsed to its lowest since</text>
  <text start="365.87" dur="5.98">2007 prices of US Treasury securities</text>
  <text start="369.72" dur="5.22">fell across the spectrum a Monday and</text>
  <text start="371.85" dur="7.77">yield rose from the two-year yield on</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="6.6">down yields set new nine year highs this</text>
  <text start="379.62" dur="4.28">sell-off and the accompanying surgeon</text>
  <text start="381.54" dur="4.65">yields has occurred for months without</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="5.68">downdraft and stocks and without a</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="6.9">slowdown in the economic growth I mean</text>
  <text start="389.58" dur="5.97">it&amp;#39;s one gigantic illusionary dreamy</text>
  <text start="393.09" dur="4.26">scenario where the feds tightening has</text>
  <text start="395.55" dur="5.49">no negative impact on the economy</text>
  <text start="397.35" dur="6.53">whatsoever but we could see that there</text>
  <text start="401.04" dur="7.19">are problems we&amp;#39;ve seen this before and</text>
  <text start="403.88" dur="8.02">if we go back prior to the recession of</text>
  <text start="408.23" dur="6.4">2008-2009 we saw this happen there back</text>
  <text start="411.9" dur="5.64">in November 2007 the spread was winding</text>
  <text start="414.63" dur="5.46">after having been negative in late 2006</text>
  <text start="417.54" dur="4.74">and early 2007 as part of an inverted</text>
  <text start="420.09" dur="4.17">yield curve when investors chased after</text>
  <text start="422.28" dur="4.62">Treasuries with long maturities and</text>
  <text start="424.26" dur="4.35">their yield and their yields fell even</text>
  <text start="426.9" dur="4.11">as they dumped Treasuries with shorter</text>
  <text start="428.61" dur="5.04">maturities and their yields rose not</text>
  <text start="431.01" dur="5.61">much later the financial crisis cracked</text>
  <text start="433.65" dur="6.96">and all of a sudden everything started</text>
  <text start="436.62" dur="7.08">to crash and come down and when we look</text>
  <text start="440.61" dur="6.48">at this this is a pattern which we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="443.7" dur="6.15">been seeing over and over which tells us</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="3.96">that something is happening in the</text>
  <text start="449.85" dur="2.58">economy now of course the Fed is going</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="2.61">to contrite ooh control this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="1.41">going to manipulate this they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="453.66" dur="2.28">to</text>
  <text start="453.84" dur="5.07">whatever they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="455.94" dur="5.61">everyone in the dark until the very last</text>
  <text start="458.91" dur="3.93">moment but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="461.55" dur="4.589">this and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this</text>
  <text start="462.84" dur="6.93">in other reports where inflation is</text>
  <text start="466.139" dur="5.161">starting to creep up now and inflation</text>
  <text start="469.77" dur="4.709">is already moving beneath the surface</text>
  <text start="471.3" dur="6.119">and the Fed is very worried about this</text>
  <text start="474.479" dur="4.711">and again many countries out there</text>
  <text start="477.419" dur="3.931">realize that the inflation rate is much</text>
  <text start="479.19" dur="4.25">much higher than it really is this is</text>
  <text start="481.35" dur="4.47">why a lot of the countries have been</text>
  <text start="483.44" dur="5.88">purchasing a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="485.82" dur="6.75">keeping that purchasing a lot more</text>
  <text start="489.32" dur="6.849">keeping it not selling it because they</text>
  <text start="492.57" dur="5.79">understand that is a protector against</text>
  <text start="496.169" dur="3.991">inflation and everyone should do the</text>
  <text start="498.36" dur="3.18">same thing yes I know we have the crypto</text>
  <text start="500.16" dur="5.009">market but everything has its own place</text>
  <text start="501.54" dur="5.46">and I don&amp;#39;t believe one thing is the</text>
  <text start="505.169" dur="3.87">thing that you should go with I mean</text>
  <text start="507" dur="4.5">gold and silver has been around for</text>
  <text start="509.039" dur="4.8">thousands and thousands of years it have</text>
  <text start="511.5" dur="3.96">protected people&amp;#39;s wealth cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="513.839" dur="3.541">is something brand-new it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="515.46" dur="4.59">the Internet it&amp;#39;s like the Wild West</text>
  <text start="517.38" dur="3.81">at any moment again there could be some</text>
  <text start="520.05" dur="2.94">type of regulation there could be</text>
  <text start="521.19" dur="4.74">something that comes out that brings it</text>
  <text start="522.99" dur="5.82">right down and we have to understand</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="5.31">that you can&amp;#39;t have your all your eggs</text>
  <text start="528.81" dur="4.77">in one basket and for everyone out there</text>
  <text start="531.24" dur="4.11">saying that oh you just do crypto oh you</text>
  <text start="533.58" dur="3.42">should just do gold no I think you</text>
  <text start="535.35" dur="4.29">should have everything in different</text>
  <text start="537" dur="4.29">places to protect yourself for what is</text>
  <text start="539.64" dur="3.63">coming because there are very all</text>
  <text start="541.29" dur="5.91">different scenarios that could happen</text>
  <text start="543.27" dur="7.5">just like to have food water a weapon</text>
  <text start="547.2" dur="6.66">medical supplies cash on hand you need</text>
  <text start="550.77" dur="5.34">all of this it&amp;#39;s not just one thing so</text>
  <text start="553.86" dur="4.02">this is why you need to look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.11" dur="3.27">going on you need to understand what is</text>
  <text start="557.88" dur="3.24">going on and this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="4.709">reporting on all these different things</text>
  <text start="561.12" dur="4.8">so it&amp;#39;s not just one thing it&amp;#39;s taking</text>
  <text start="564.089" dur="4.44">the stepping back and taking a look at</text>
  <text start="565.92" dur="5.22">the entire picture now Bank of America</text>
  <text start="568.529" dur="4.801">they came out and they had this forecast</text>
  <text start="571.14" dur="5.28">where they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="573.33" dur="6.03">a stock flash crash and a bond bubble</text>
  <text start="576.42" dur="5.16">burst in 2018 now Bank of America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="579.36" dur="3.06">chief investment strategist not only</text>
  <text start="581.58" dur="3.18">once again</text>
  <text start="582.42" dur="4.47">dares to time this market which is very</text>
  <text start="584.76" dur="2.76">difficult to do they are making a</text>
  <text start="586.89" dur="3.36">prediction</text>
  <text start="587.52" dur="4.95">that in the first half of 2018 we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.25" dur="6.54">going to see some type of flash crash</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="6.39">like we saw in 1987 1994 1998 and when</text>
  <text start="596.79" dur="4.11">we look back in time we can see what has</text>
  <text start="598.86" dur="4.32">happened where all of a sudden the S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="600.9" dur="5.07">you know ran these streaks and all of a</text>
  <text start="603.18" dur="7.35">sudden it came crashing down now we need</text>
  <text start="605.97" dur="6.72">to understand that all of this and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="610.53" dur="5.01">very difficult to predict but we know</text>
  <text start="612.69" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;re reaching a certain point where</text>
  <text start="615.54" dur="6.24">anything could bring down this market</text>
  <text start="618.06" dur="5.25">that can crash the bond market I mean</text>
  <text start="621.78" dur="4.14">look the central banks have been</text>
  <text start="623.31" dur="4.26">purchasing tech stocks we know the</text>
  <text start="625.92" dur="4.5">corporate earnings they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="627.57" dur="4.65">manipulated accounting methods we know</text>
  <text start="630.42" dur="4.53">that they don&amp;#39;t have the sales they</text>
  <text start="632.22" dur="5.94">don&amp;#39;t have the revenue we understand GDP</text>
  <text start="634.95" dur="5.31">unemployment retail sales it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="638.16" dur="3.87">falling apart and this is all happening</text>
  <text start="640.26" dur="3.6">at the same time now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="642.03" dur="3.38">interesting about this in 2018 we</text>
  <text start="643.86" dur="4.2">understand that the Economist magazine</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="5.32">also predicted that we were going to</text>
  <text start="648.06" dur="5.85">head into a new currency at this time</text>
  <text start="650.73" dur="4.95">and here we are approaching 2018 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="653.91" dur="4.71">getting closer and closer and it looks</text>
  <text start="655.68" dur="5.6">like we might be you know in for some</text>
