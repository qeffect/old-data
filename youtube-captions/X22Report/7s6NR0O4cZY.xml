  <text start="61.74" dur="5.88">October 13 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="65.01" dur="4.56">episode is Russia and China just did</text>
  <text start="67.62" dur="4.44">something that will be a blow to the</text>
  <text start="69.57" dur="4.53">dollar let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.06" dur="4.53">collapse financial news well it looks</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="5.25">like the government the US government</text>
  <text start="76.59" dur="5.94">the central banks they&amp;#39;ve finally done</text>
  <text start="79.35" dur="5.94">it and their mission was to convince the</text>
  <text start="82.53" dur="5.699">people that everything is absolutely</text>
  <text start="85.29" dur="6.06">fine in the economy now despite storms</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="6.181">wildfires quakes high gas prices failed</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="5.97">Washington policies the University of</text>
  <text start="94.41" dur="5.4">Michigan the you Mitch survey says that</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="6.72">people are the most confident since</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="6.809">January of 2004 now if we go back in</text>
  <text start="104.04" dur="5.82">time and we go back to the times where</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="11.31">we had recessions we can see that each</text>
  <text start="109.86" dur="11.85">time back in 99 2001 2007 going into</text>
  <text start="117.929" dur="7.261">2008 people were very confident at those</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="7.95">times and then what happened the entire</text>
  <text start="125.19" dur="7.26">thing fell apart now we need to remember</text>
  <text start="129.66" dur="4.5">that people believe the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="4.65">well because the stock market is</text>
  <text start="134.16" dur="5.159">continually rallying and they believe</text>
  <text start="137.1" dur="3.98">that the stock market will rally further</text>
  <text start="139.319" dur="4.081">in the next 12 months</text>
  <text start="141.08" dur="4.05">even though Americans are living</text>
  <text start="143.4" dur="5.37">paycheck to paycheck</text>
  <text start="145.13" dur="6.189">their pensions are in trouble people are</text>
  <text start="148.77" dur="5.67">losing their jobs retail well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="151.319" dur="5.821">closing a lot of stores the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="154.44" dur="4.32">are completely fake phony and false the</text>
  <text start="157.14" dur="5.25">unemployment numbers are fake phony and</text>
  <text start="158.76" dur="6.3">false they were successful in convincing</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="6.15">the public that everything is going to</text>
  <text start="165.06" dur="6.48">be fine and we saw this right before we</text>
  <text start="168.54" dur="5.79">had the recession of 2008 where people</text>
  <text start="171.54" dur="4.62">believed that this could never end that</text>
  <text start="174.33" dur="3.69">real estate would continually move up</text>
  <text start="176.16" dur="4.409">the stock market would continually move</text>
  <text start="178.02" dur="5.94">up we would never have a during a</text>
  <text start="180.569" dur="6.391">downturn and it all completely fell</text>
  <text start="183.96" dur="5.64">apart now when we look at</text>
  <text start="186.96" dur="4.95">Wells Fargo we are seeing that there are</text>
  <text start="189.6" dur="5.34">mortgage applications well it is</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="5.82">completely falling apart they&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="194.94" dur="6.18">drop of around 27 percent year-on-year</text>
  <text start="197.73" dur="5.43">in mortgage applications and they</text>
  <text start="201.12" dur="7.29">declined by 73 billion in the third</text>
  <text start="203.16" dur="8.91">quarter and we can also see that the</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="7.05">automobile loan originations they are</text>
  <text start="212.07" dur="5.46">tumbling by 47 percent year-on-year to</text>
  <text start="215.46" dur="3.6">only four point three billion now this</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="4.82">is the lowest since the bank started</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="6.06">disclosing this item back in 2013 so</text>
  <text start="222.35" dur="4.45">when we look at this we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="4.38">the auto loan origination the mortgage</text>
  <text start="226.8" dur="6.51">origination they are all declining at</text>
  <text start="229.5" dur="6.03">the same rate there are problems ahead</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="4.17">here now it&amp;#39;s very interesting the Bank</text>
  <text start="235.53" dur="4.98">of England suggests that the British</text>
  <text start="237.48" dur="5.64">consumer is about to face the biggest</text>
  <text start="240.51" dur="6.75">credit crunch since the great financial</text>
  <text start="243.12" dur="5.9">crisis and it&amp;#39;s not only in England it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="4.62">going to be worldwide</text>
  <text start="249.02" dur="5.38">now the Bank of England is continually</text>
  <text start="251.88" dur="4.68">warning that there is a surging pace of</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="3.57">lending to households British lenders</text>
  <text start="256.56" dur="4.41">are planning the biggest cutback in</text>
  <text start="257.97" dur="6.09">consumer loans in nearly 10 years and we</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="6.33">know that the credit impulse has gone</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="4.29">negative we can see that in England in</text>
  <text start="267.3" dur="4.92">the United States</text>
  <text start="268.35" dur="6.42">well people they don&amp;#39;t have the ability</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="5.55">to take out loans credit cards are maxed</text>
  <text start="274.77" dur="6.36">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that mortgage</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="5.73">applications auto loans and the rest</text>
  <text start="281.13" dur="6">well it&amp;#39;s all starting to freeze up and</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="6.6">if this does happen and credit does</text>
  <text start="287.13" dur="4.56">freeze like it did back in 2008 we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.1" dur="4.34">going to be in for a lot of trouble now</text>
  <text start="291.69" dur="5.22">the latest survey signals the steepest</text>
  <text start="294.44" dur="4.75">contraction since the fourth quarter of</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="5.37">2008 when the economy was in the depths</text>
  <text start="299.19" dur="5.04">of its worst post-war recession and we</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="4.11">see right now that this is going to</text>
  <text start="304.23" dur="6.51">spread all over the place it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="306.39" dur="6.72">to be isolated to one area because just</text>
  <text start="310.74" dur="4.02">like the housing market it spread to</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="3.03">many different areas not just here in</text>
  <text start="314.76" dur="3.42">the United States but to many different</text>
  <text start="316.14" dur="4.62">countries and now we see other countries</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="4.23">where their bubbles have blown up</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="3.75">larger than the United States well</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s going to spread back to the</text>
  <text start="324.51" dur="4.8">United States so it&amp;#39;s all interconnected</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="5.22">and all they did was push things in all</text>
  <text start="329.31" dur="3.84">different directions and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="331.77" dur="3.99">watching this we&amp;#39;ve been following this</text>
  <text start="333.15" dur="5.64">and we know that all of this has what</text>
  <text start="335.76" dur="5.07">been one big gigantic illusion and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.79" dur="4.35">seeing all these indicators and all</text>
  <text start="340.83" dur="5.3">these indicators are showing us that</text>
  <text start="343.14" dur="5.28">there are major problems ahead of us and</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="2.74">they&amp;#39;re approaching very very quickly</text>
  <text start="348.42" dur="3.18">now</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="5.25">China and Russia they are continually</text>
  <text start="351.6" dur="5.01">moving forward where they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="354.12" dur="4.35">things without the dollar and the US</text>
  <text start="356.61" dur="5.28">received a major blow to its global</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="6.51">hegemony and one which is sure to</text>
  <text start="361.89" dur="6.72">trigger more talks with Washington</text>
  <text start="364.98" dur="6.54">against China against Russia we see that</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="5.58">China has established a payment versus</text>
  <text start="371.52" dur="4.65">payment system to clear Chinese you want</text>
  <text start="374.19" dur="5.25">and Russian ruble transaction now the</text>
  <text start="376.17" dur="5.79">aim which we are understanding is to</text>
  <text start="379.44" dur="4.53">reduce the risks and improve the</text>
  <text start="381.96" dur="5.7">efficiency of its foreign exchange</text>
  <text start="383.97" dur="6.71">system the new mechanism which is going</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="5.73">to rival the u.s. Swift interbank</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="5.31">payment system and what does it actually</text>
  <text start="393.39" dur="5.43">do well it allows for a simultaneous</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="5.02">settlement of transactions in two</text>
  <text start="398.82" dur="4.2">different currencies it was launched on</text>
  <text start="401.01" dur="5.07">Monday after we&amp;#39;re seeing approval from</text>
  <text start="403.02" dur="6.51">China central bank and we see right now</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="6.3">that again they&amp;#39;re doing everything step</text>
  <text start="409.53" dur="6.12">by step to make sure they&amp;#39;re prepared</text>
  <text start="412.38" dur="5.58">and ready for what is coming and that is</text>
  <text start="415.65" dur="4.5">the dollar declining that is the dollar</text>
  <text start="417.96" dur="4.92">is going to be doomed and this is a</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="6.3">major blow now China is going to be</text>
  <text start="422.88" dur="6.03">buying Saudi oil in you one here is</text>
  <text start="426.45" dur="6.03">another country where they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="428.91" dur="5.25">to be using the dollar and we need to</text>
  <text start="432.48" dur="4.47">understand something very important</text>
  <text start="434.16" dur="6.6">Russia just made a deal with Saudi</text>
  <text start="436.95" dur="6.33">Arabia with their oil market they also</text>
  <text start="440.76" dur="5.1">made a deal with their military assets</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="6.12">by supplying in the s400 missile system</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="7.26">we also understand that the global oil</text>
  <text start="449.4" dur="5.16">market could follow in Saudi Arabia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="3.33">footsteps</text>
  <text start="454.56" dur="4.17">and this would spell a catastrophe for</text>
  <text start="456.45" dur="5.189">the United States dollar as they were as</text>
  <text start="458.73" dur="6.47">the world&amp;#39;s reserve currency so all of</text>
  <text start="461.639" dur="5.761">this is happening all at once and it is</text>
  <text start="465.2" dur="4.21">accelerating more countries are looking</text>
  <text start="467.4" dur="4.17">at this saying you know something we can</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="4.08">trade in yuan we don&amp;#39;t need to use the</text>
  <text start="471.57" dur="4.29">dollar then as well as saying this Saudi</text>
  <text start="473.49" dur="4.62">Arabia&amp;#39;s saying this Iran is doing this</text>
  <text start="475.86" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re gonna be seeing Syria do this most</text>
  <text start="478.11" dur="3.39">likely Iraq is going to be doing this we</text>
  <text start="479.91" dur="3.479">know that China and Russia are already</text>
  <text start="481.5" dur="3.06">doing this and the rest of the Middle</text>
  <text start="483.389" dur="4.521">Eastern countries where Russia is</text>
  <text start="484.56" dur="6.54">talking peace in Libya helping Lebanon</text>
  <text start="487.91" dur="5.319">helping many of the other countries they</text>
  <text start="491.1" dur="5.28">are all going to be turning towards</text>
  <text start="493.229" dur="6.361">Russia turning towards China and they</text>
  <text start="496.38" dur="8.16">will end up using the yuan which means</text>
  <text start="499.59" dur="6.27">once again that the dollar is going to</text>
  <text start="504.54" dur="3.39">be sent back to United States because</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="5.64">these countries they won&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="5.909">dollar to purchase the oil there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="511.5" dur="3.39">reason to keep it in reserves and if</text>
  <text start="513.839" dur="2.58">they don&amp;#39;t need to keep it in reserves</text>
  <text start="514.89" dur="3.149">they&amp;#39;re gonna send it back to United</text>
  <text start="516.419" dur="3.541">States if it comes back to the United</text>
  <text start="518.039" dur="3.781">States we&amp;#39;re gonna have more dollars in</text>
  <text start="519.96" dur="3.6">circulation and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="521.82" dur="3.87">this in depth for the last couple of</text>
  <text start="523.56" dur="4.26">days we are going to see inflation</text>
  <text start="525.69" dur="4.68">because as there are more dollars in</text>
  <text start="527.82" dur="5.91">circulation that means that Dow the</text>
  <text start="530.37" dur="5.55">value of the dollar decreases we already</text>
  <text start="533.73" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re already starting to see this</text>
  <text start="535.92" dur="4.5">happen right in front of our noses it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.71" dur="3.21">not something that happens very quickly</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;ve been following this for quite a</text>
  <text start="541.92" dur="4.95">while it&amp;#39;s a very slow process and the</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="3.87">reason why it&amp;#39;s very slow is because</text>
  <text start="546.87" dur="3.93">they don&amp;#39;t want the rest of the world to</text>
  <text start="549.24" dur="4.349">wake up to really understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="550.8" dur="5.13">going on central bankers work very very</text>
  <text start="553.589" dur="4.381">quietly very methodically and they make</text>
  <text start="555.93" dur="3.84">sure that whatever they&amp;#39;re doing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="557.97" dur="3.57">really not important don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="3.63">pay attention to that wanted to look at</text>
  <text start="561.54" dur="4.56">the stock market instead because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="563.4" dur="4.41">what&amp;#39;s most important but really the</text>
  <text start="566.1" dur="3.45">stock market is the least important and</text>
  <text start="567.81" dur="4.13">everything else they&amp;#39;re doing behind the</text>
  <text start="569.55" dur="4.38">scenes that&amp;#39;s where the importance lies</text>
  <text start="571.94" dur="4.899">that&amp;#39;s where we should be looking</text>
  <text start="573.93" dur="7.17">because they&amp;#39;re already setting up the</text>
  <text start="576.839" dur="5.671">next system they&amp;#39;re already doing it I</text>
  <text start="581.1" dur="2.67">mean right in front of us and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="582.51" dur="3.81">following it we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it</text>
  <text start="583.77" dur="4.17">every single year and we can see how</text>
  <text start="586.32" dur="2.16">they announce that we&amp;#39;re going to make a</text>
  <text start="587.94" dur="2.759">payments</text>
  <text start="588.48" dur="3.96">them they made a payment system they</text>
  <text start="590.699" dur="3.51">announced that they were going to trade</text>
  <text start="592.44" dur="3.6">between the two countries China and</text>
  <text start="594.209" dur="3.151">Russia not using the dollar and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="596.04" dur="3.51">gonna have oil trade using their own</text>
  <text start="597.36" dur="4.56">currencies they went ahead and they did</text>
  <text start="599.55" dur="4.05">it we saw that China was making</text>
  <text start="601.92" dur="4.14">bilateral trade agreements with many</text>
  <text start="603.6" dur="4.77">many different countries and here we are</text>

  <text start="617.37" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;ve done it they&amp;#39;re gonna be using</text>
  <text start="620.49" dur="5.45">the yuan so other countries can use it</text>
  <text start="623.88" dur="4.889">to pay for oil here we are today</text>
  <text start="625.94" dur="6.07">countries are already signing on the</text>

  <text start="632.01" dur="3.93">much done everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="633.449" dur="5.88">talking about and yes it was a slow</text>
  <text start="635.94" dur="5.13">process yes it took some time yes they</text>
  <text start="639.329" dur="3.151">duplicated everything that they had that</text>
  <text start="641.07" dur="4.59">we have in the west over in the east</text>
  <text start="642.48" dur="6.18">like their payment system it&amp;#39;s all being</text>
  <text start="645.66" dur="4.91">done right now because they understand</text>
  <text start="648.66" dur="4.83">that the system is going to fall apart</text>
  <text start="650.57" dur="5.23">the central bankers are ready to move</text>
  <text start="653.49" dur="3.18">everything away from the United States</text>
  <text start="655.8" dur="1.95">because they don&amp;#39;t care what country</text>
  <text start="656.67" dur="3.359">they go to they have no allegiance</text>
  <text start="657.75" dur="3.959">whatsoever makes no difference to them</text>
  <text start="660.029" dur="4.591">as long as they can control the creation</text>
