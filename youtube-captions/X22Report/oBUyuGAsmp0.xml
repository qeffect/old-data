  <text start="43.71" dur="7.619">now we understand Greece still working</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="5.28">with the ECB talking to Russia and it</text>
  <text start="51.329" dur="5.16">seems like they might be pivoting</text>
  <text start="53.22" dur="5.37">towards Russia because they made a</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="5.101">statement that we want Russia to help us</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="4.95">rebuild the Greek economy both trade</text>

  <text start="75.17" dur="10.57">to help the economy grow the central</text>
  <text start="80.94" dur="8.219">banking system the IMF will continually</text>
  <text start="85.74" dur="5.58">put the country into debt this is the</text>
  <text start="89.159" dur="5.091">big difference because as we can see and</text>
  <text start="91.32" dur="5.46">from one of the politicians in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="94.25" dur="5.95">where they surveyed all the countries</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="6.949">that the IMF is involved with they have</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="6.87">seen that every single country has</text>

  <text start="112.02" dur="6.09">countries into debt they give them more</text>
  <text start="114.869" dur="6.18">debt they impose austerity on the people</text>
  <text start="118.11" dur="6.869">and the economy of each of these</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="7.71">countries does not grow and of course</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="5.93">Greece now has the choice of saying you</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="5.371">know something we&amp;#39;re going to default</text>
  <text start="130.909" dur="7.061">we&amp;#39;re going to slide over to rush</text>
  <text start="134.13" dur="5.31">to the brick system and of course what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="3.36">going to happen they&amp;#39;ll lift the ban</text>
  <text start="139.44" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ll be able to sell their products</text>
  <text start="141.33" dur="5.48">to Russia the gas pipeline is going to</text>
  <text start="143.52" dur="7.23">be built and they&amp;#39;re gonna bail out the</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="7.18">banks and they&amp;#39;re going to help the</text>
  <text start="150.75" dur="6.75">country get back on its feet and if this</text>
  <text start="153.99" dur="7.98">occurs the rest of the countries Italy</text>
  <text start="157.5" dur="5.58">Spain France Portugal they&amp;#39;re all going</text>
  <text start="161.97" dur="3.32">to look at this and say you know</text>

  <text start="165.29" dur="6.4">look how good it still look how good</text>
  <text start="167.82" dur="7.26">they&amp;#39;re doing and this is what the</text>
  <text start="171.69" dur="5.28">central bankers are worried about now</text>
  <text start="175.08" dur="4.58">here in the United States they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="176.97" dur="7.32">continually trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="179.66" dur="7.78">everything is perfectly fine we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="184.29" dur="5.37">this incredible recovery and this is</text>
  <text start="187.44" dur="3.78">what a recovery looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.66" dur="4.71">trying to convince us that yes this is</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="6.12">what it looks like and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="6.42">is that we are totally not in a recovery</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="8.78">we are in a major collapse of the entire</text>
  <text start="200.79" dur="8.49">system just because the stock market is</text>
  <text start="206.12" dur="5.79">continually propped up that doesn&amp;#39;t show</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="6.83">us what the economy is actually doing</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="11.23">when we actually look around and we see</text>
  <text start="216.11" dur="11.5">stores closing housing declining people</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="7.26">out of work this tells us what is really</text>
  <text start="227.61" dur="4.53">going on in this country when we see the</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="6.059">infrastructure completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="232.14" dur="8.16">roads bridges aqueducts everything you</text>
  <text start="236.459" dur="5.851">see it it&amp;#39;s falling apart the system is</text>
  <text start="240.3" dur="4.08">in a major collapse now of course</text>
  <text start="242.31" dur="4.38">everyone&amp;#39;s going to wake up when the</text>
  <text start="244.38" dur="5.67">market comes down but this collapse has</text>
  <text start="246.69" dur="7.44">been happening all along do you really</text>
  <text start="250.05" dur="7.38">think back in 1929 when the stock market</text>
  <text start="254.13" dur="5.55">crashed the economy just went south in</text>
  <text start="257.43" dur="7.29">that minute now it&amp;#39;s been it was</text>
  <text start="259.68" dur="7.47">happening all along in 2008 it started</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="5.25">declined way before that</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="5.76">just that everyone kept it quiet they</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="4.8">told everyone everything was fine we see</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="5.7">a DP they came out with their numbers</text>
  <text start="274.77" dur="6.42">today and after missing expectations and</text>
  <text start="278.61" dur="5.58">a dismal eweek februari print march</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="5.55">turned out even worse march adp</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="4.199">employment change was a mere a hundred</text>
  <text start="286.74" dur="5.7">and eighty nine thousand against</text>
  <text start="288.389" dur="7.261">expectations of about 225,000 dropping</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="7.759">to its lowest since January of 2014</text>
  <text start="295.65" dur="8.57">large business hiring that was the worst</text>
  <text start="300.199" dur="7.661">they only added about 19 thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="5.89">jobs growth is strong but slowing this</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="5.58">is what they&amp;#39;re telling us it&amp;#39;s strong</text>
  <text start="310.11" dur="6.77">but it slowed up a little bit but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="313.44" dur="8.539">really weak and accelerating lower</text>
  <text start="316.88" dur="9.75">manufacturing jobs only added a thousand</text>
  <text start="321.979" dur="6.94">and we can see right now this system is</text>
  <text start="326.63" dur="6.7">completely falling apart we are a</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="10.021">part-time nation people cannot find the</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="7.29">high-paying full-time jobs and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.94" dur="4.32">continually looking and those people are</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="6">continually looking they&amp;#39;re not counted</text>
  <text start="343.26" dur="6.689">and this is where we&amp;#39;re getting these</text>
  <text start="346.62" dur="6.299">manipulated unemployment numbers we see</text>
  <text start="349.949" dur="9.301">that households today are struggling to</text>
  <text start="352.919" dur="9.93">save money half of us households can</text>
  <text start="359.25" dur="5.96">even save a few cents according to the</text>
  <text start="362.849" dur="5.611">results of a new survey by bankrate.com</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="6.19">one in five said they&amp;#39;re not even able</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="4.62">to save a penny and I believe this I</text>
  <text start="371.4" dur="3.989">think most of the people today are</text>
  <text start="373.08" dur="4.29">living on credit if they didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="375.389" dur="4.831">their credit cards I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="5.39">be able to make it today even those</text>
  <text start="380.22" dur="5.25">people who are working I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="382.76" dur="4.21">substituting what they&amp;#39;ve lost an income</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="3.419">and using their credit cards making</text>
  <text start="386.97" dur="4.229">their small payments but eventually what</text>
  <text start="388.889" dur="5.481">happens as everyone knows it cannot be</text>
  <text start="391.199" dur="5.911">sustained as time goes on we see</text>
  <text start="394.37" dur="5.56">manufacturing declining is a</text>
  <text start="397.11" dur="3.94">manufacturing tumbled to 51.5 missing</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="4.479">expectations of</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="6.48">2.5 this is the lowest since May 2013</text>
  <text start="404.409" dur="5.311">under the covers it is even uglier with</text>
  <text start="407.53" dur="5.58">the lowest new orders since january 2014</text>
  <text start="409.72" dur="6.09">as US manufacturing data has missed five</text>
  <text start="413.11" dur="5.19">of the last seven months and dropped for</text>
  <text start="415.81" dur="8.22">four for five months in a row which</text>
  <text start="418.3" dur="11.19">hasn&amp;#39;t happened since 2008 the system</text>
  <text start="424.03" dur="7.83">again is not working anymore yes they</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="5.07">can manipulate the numbers they can make</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="5.25">us look at unemployment and they can</text>
  <text start="434.56" dur="5.13">continually massage them manipulate them</text>
  <text start="437.11" dur="5.13">they can massage GDP the massage</text>
  <text start="439.69" dur="5.279">inflation they can do all of this they</text>
  <text start="442.24" dur="7.169">can pump the market up but reality is</text>
  <text start="444.969" dur="8.7">reality and when this continually creeps</text>
  <text start="449.409" dur="6.421">up and reality sets in all this</text>
  <text start="453.669" dur="4.351">manipulation is just going to be that</text>
  <text start="455.83" dur="4.92">manipulation people are going to say</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="5.13">wait a minute it really doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="460.75" dur="4.38">sense anything anymore there are more</text>
  <text start="463.15" dur="5.19">people on the streets today than ever</text>
  <text start="465.13" dur="4.98">before they have no homes why is real</text>
  <text start="468.34" dur="5.46">estate collapsing why are more stores</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="6.179">closing I mean look what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="473.8" dur="5.399">Canada UK in the United States stores</text>
  <text start="476.289" dur="6.62">are closing left and right people are</text>
  <text start="479.199" dur="6.27">being laid off manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="482.909" dur="6.781">declining the Baltic Dry Index dropped</text>
  <text start="485.469" dur="8.401">six points to 596 now we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="489.69" dur="6.55">improve a little bit not much it only</text>
  <text start="493.87" dur="5.43">got up to about 60 to then it dropped</text>
  <text start="496.24" dur="6.239">back down and the only reason right now</text>
  <text start="499.3" dur="12.619">that I can see that it has gone up is</text>
  <text start="502.479" dur="12.75">because the the higher capsize rates</text>
  <text start="511.919" dur="6.37">increased which pushed the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="515.229" dur="8.67">Index up a little bit it wasn&amp;#39;t because</text>
  <text start="518.289" dur="9.151">of manufacturing it was because the</text>
  <text start="523.899" dur="6.591">capsized rates increased manufacturing</text>
  <text start="527.44" dur="7.009">is declining and continually declining</text>
  <text start="530.49" dur="3.959">we see US auto sales</text>
  <text start="534.64" dur="6.42">not do well whatsoever us car buyers</text>
  <text start="538.09" dur="5.49">stepped on the brakes in March general</text>
  <text start="541.06" dur="5.88">motor sales fell two percent Ford and</text>
  <text start="543.58" dur="8.43">Nissan three percent Honda down five</text>
  <text start="546.94" dur="8.16">percent and we&amp;#39;re wondering how has GM</text>
  <text start="552.01" dur="7.08">continually kept their sales up all this</text>
  <text start="555.1" dur="5.52">time well we know a couple of reasons we</text>
  <text start="559.09" dur="4.2">know they were channel stuff and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="560.62" dur="5.97">basically what they do is they create</text>
  <text start="563.29" dur="5.1">the cars they manufacture them and the</text>
  <text start="566.59" dur="3.21">dealers take delivery but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="568.39" dur="4.05">people that are actually buying them and</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="5.52">they stuff the Lots with many many cars</text>
  <text start="572.44" dur="4.83">we understand that the auto industry has</text>
  <text start="575.32" dur="4.17">been letting in subprime people and</text>
  <text start="577.27" dur="7.92">actually anyone with a harpy can get a</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="9.57">loan to purchase a car this is drying up</text>
  <text start="585.19" dur="7.17">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder to sell</text>
  <text start="589.06" dur="5.04">these cars because those people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="592.36" dur="7.05">just drawing up they just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="594.1" dur="8.43">resources to keep this up and how is GM</text>
  <text start="599.41" dur="5.34">continually keeping this going well they</text>
  <text start="602.53" dur="6.6">had help from the government that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="604.75" dur="8.42">right who is buying the cars the US</text>
  <text start="609.13" dur="11.09">government they have purchased about</text>
  <text start="613.17" dur="9.13">twenty four percent of the automobiles</text>
  <text start="620.22" dur="4.18">roughly about a hundred percent higher</text>
  <text start="622.3" dur="6.12">than GM&amp;#39;s headline rate of sales</text>
  <text start="624.4" dur="7.29">increase and if we look at this we can</text>
  <text start="628.42" dur="5.93">see throughout all this time period they</text>
  <text start="631.69" dur="7.29">are continually purchasing the cars</text>
  <text start="634.35" dur="7.2">pushing them up these aren&amp;#39;t real sales</text>
  <text start="638.98" dur="6.26">these are sales to the government</text>
  <text start="641.55" dur="6.34">subprime sales most of these people are</text>
  <text start="645.24" dur="6.73">delinquent on their loans the cars are</text>
  <text start="647.89" dur="9">getting repossessed again this this is</text>
  <text start="651.97" dur="7.02">completely fake phony and false we see</text>

  <text start="707.19" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s the weather this is why the economy</text>
  <text start="710.22" dur="3.57">is not doing well because the Northeast</text>
  <text start="712.11" dur="4.83">had snow but the rest of the country is</text>

  <text start="716.94" dur="3.63">doing well no maybe economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="719.04" dur="3.06">well is because we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="720.57" dur="3.48">manufacturing people aren&amp;#39;t out there</text>

  <text start="728.67" dur="4.289">closing and they&amp;#39;re laying off more</text>
  <text start="730.29" dur="5.16">people as the government continually</text>
  <text start="732.959" dur="4.711">adds more and more debt to the economic</text>
  <text start="735.45" dur="5.009">system where they keep us in the dark</text>
  <text start="737.67" dur="4.53">because they&amp;#39;re using manipulated</text>
  <text start="740.459" dur="4.891">illusionary numbers to pretend that</text>
  <text start="742.2" dur="5.759">we&amp;#39;re in a recovery actually these GDP</text>
  <text start="745.35" dur="5.58">numbers are much much lower you have to</text>
  <text start="747.959" dur="3.991">remember they manipulate these numbers</text>
  <text start="750.93" dur="2.849">they went all the way back to nineteen</text>
  <text start="751.95" dur="3.27">twenty nine added research and</text>
  <text start="753.779" dur="4.381">development recalculated all the way up</text>
  <text start="755.22" dur="5.13">to the present day the deflation that</text>
  <text start="758.16" dur="7.86">we&amp;#39;re seeing here in the US except for</text>
  <text start="760.35" dur="8.79">food of course adds to the GDP so what</text>
  <text start="766.02" dur="8.1">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this</text>
  <text start="769.14" dur="9.24">entire economy is in a collapse right</text>
  <text start="774.12" dur="6.81">now they just haven&amp;#39;t announced it when</text>

  <text start="1066.11" dur="7.29">what they did was they came out and make</text>
  <text start="1068.09" dur="7.86">plained that china is not using IT</text>

  <text start="1117.11" dur="5.13">the NSA can spy on everyone you have to</text>
  <text start="1120.38" dur="3.06">remember the spying is for many</text>
  <text start="1122.24" dur="5.659">different agendas to spy on the American</text>
  <text start="1123.44" dur="8.04">people do blackmail government officials</text>

  <text start="1186.559" dur="4.801">which I hope it will because you have to</text>
  <text start="1189.59" dur="5.939">remember the founding fathers of the</text>
  <text start="1191.36" dur="7.89">United States said that the rights of</text>

  <text start="1346.82" dur="6.84">Obama took out his pen his paper and he</text>
  <text start="1351.89" dur="5.85">decided to create another executive</text>

  <text start="1370.85" dur="6.99">Russia China North Korea Syria and he</text>
  <text start="1375.17" dur="4.56">did this because it&amp;#39;s easy to do you</text>
  <text start="1377.84" dur="5.97">don&amp;#39;t have to prove anything all you</text>
  <text start="1379.73" dur="8.88">have to say is that yes we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1383.81" dur="7.89">China who cyber attacked this company</text>
  <text start="1388.61" dur="5.46">this website and we&amp;#39;re going to place</text>
  <text start="1391.7" dur="5.07">sanctions on China and it makes it</text>

  <text start="1396.77" dur="6.84">country with absolutely no proof proof</text>
  <text start="1400.07" dur="5.28">whatsoever Obama said cyber threats</text>
  <text start="1403.61" dur="5.07">posed one of the most serious economic</text>
  <text start="1405.35" dur="6.69">and national security challenges to the</text>
  <text start="1408.68" dur="6.57">United States and his new executive</text>
  <text start="1412.04" dur="6.71">order will give the u.s. the authority</text>

  <text start="1418.87" dur="6.61">but he hasn&amp;#39;t really mentioned what the</text>
  <text start="1421.37" dur="5.49">specific penalties are the executive</text>

  <text start="1439.28" dur="10.11">question is with this new executive</text>
  <text start="1442.52" dur="11.37">order can they go after companies like</text>
  <text start="1449.39" dur="6.96">WikiLeaks or Edward Snowden who you know</text>
  <text start="1453.89" dur="5.85">get information about like say the TPP</text>

  <text start="1467.09" dur="4.439">yes this falls under this</text>

  <text start="1597.769" dur="6.601">elements highlighted by this new bill</text>

  <text start="1604.37" dur="6.63">about basically what it would do it</text>
  <text start="1608.36" dur="6.06">would mandate a national ID card for</text>
  <text start="1611" dur="7.62">every American as a condition of working</text>
  <text start="1614.42" dur="6.75">it would also force employers in America</text>

  <text start="1625.94" dur="4.8">government permission to work so</text>
  <text start="1628.04" dur="7.26">basically if you want a job you will</text>
  <text start="1630.74" dur="7.53">need to get one of these cards and it</text>
  <text start="1635.3" dur="4.17">will check to see if maybe I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1638.27" dur="3.87">what requirements they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="1639.47" dur="3.93">but you know oh look as credits not that</text>
  <text start="1642.14" dur="3.45">great maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t give him the</text>
  <text start="1643.4" dur="4.08">job because he might steal or something</text>
  <text start="1645.59" dur="4.35">like that I mean look at the automobile</text>
  <text start="1647.48" dur="6.93">industry right now they check your</text>
  <text start="1649.94" dur="9.03">credit to get auto insurance it makes no</text>
  <text start="1654.41" dur="6.29">sense if you pay in full they still</text>
  <text start="1658.97" dur="7.23">check your credit and your rate is</text>
  <text start="1660.7" dur="7.18">adjusted on your credit score and we can</text>
  <text start="1666.2" dur="5.79">see right now they&amp;#39;re going to use this</text>
  <text start="1667.88" dur="5.46">to track and you keep an eye and you</text>
  <text start="1671.99" dur="3.03">actually have to get permission from the</text>
  <text start="1673.34" dur="4.11">government because every time they do</text>
  <text start="1675.02" dur="5.91">this the government says yes you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1677.45" dur="6.87">clear you can work oh no you can&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="1680.93" dur="6.81">and this is going to contain a lot of</text>

  <text start="1975.47" dur="5.1">bilateral security agreement and what</text>
  <text start="1977.51" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;ve seen is that opium production has</text>
  <text start="1980.57" dur="8.34">been on the rise in Afghanistan ever</text>
  <text start="1983.48" dur="10.76">since the u.s. went into Afghanistan so</text>
  <text start="1988.91" dur="9.99">the mercenary firm Blackwater or Academy</text>

  <text start="2012.26" dur="6.36">basically what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="2015.46" dur="6.689">since the u.s. toppled the Taliban in</text>
  <text start="2018.62" dur="7.59">2002 opium production in the country has</text>

  <text start="2047.929" dur="6.18">pay for their secretive operations</text>
  <text start="2051.28" dur="4.48">that&amp;#39;s why it is tripled if you look at</text>
  <text start="2054.109" dur="4.56">this and then you look at Syria where</text>
  <text start="2055.76" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re bombing the Islamic state in</text>
  <text start="2058.669" dur="6.45">Syria isn&amp;#39;t it strange how their</text>

  <text start="2157.31" dur="7.25">want to go to war and we know they</text>

  <text start="2304.46" dur="4.2">we can see they are building up for a</text>

  <text start="2381.41" dur="9.9">is made we can see we will know what</text>
  <text start="2387.83" dur="5.49">happened because as soon as I ran starts</text>

  <text start="2663.319" dur="6.811">be ready this year intended to replace</text>
  <text start="2666.56" dur="5.91">the ss-18 Satan and carry extensive</text>
  <text start="2670.13" dur="4.77">counter missile defense measures</text>
  <text start="2672.47" dur="6.48">they have the boring class nuclear</text>
  <text start="2674.9" dur="6.39">submarine this submarine has a</text>
  <text start="2678.95" dur="4.74">next-generation nuclear reactor can dive</text>

  <text start="2683.69" dur="4.86">20 nuclear intercontinental ballistic</text>
  <text start="2686.48" dur="4.139">missiles one of the primary things that</text>
  <text start="2688.55" dur="4.68">the US military planners worried is how</text>
  <text start="2690.619" dur="6.331">quiet these subs are in fact these subs</text>
  <text start="2693.23" dur="6.99">are so quiet that they&amp;#39;re come almost</text>
  <text start="2696.95" dur="6">completely silent why is this a problem</text>
  <text start="2700.22" dur="4.47">well imagine a scenario where Russia</text>
  <text start="2702.95" dur="3.83">nuclear subs approach our coastline</text>
  <text start="2704.69" dur="5.909">completely undetected and launch</text>
  <text start="2706.78" dur="6.27">missiles toward our cities we could be</text>
  <text start="2710.599" dur="6.181">wiped out before even know what hit us</text>
  <text start="2713.05" dur="5.95">actually back in 2012 a Russian nuclear</text>
  <text start="2716.78" dur="4.47">power attack submarine armed with</text>
  <text start="2719" dur="5.01">long-range cruise missiles operated</text>
  <text start="2721.25" dur="5.64">undetected in the Gulf of Mexico for</text>
  <text start="2724.01" dur="5.19">several weeks and it traveled in</text>
  <text start="2726.89" dur="5.01">strategic US waters was only confirmed</text>
  <text start="2729.2" dur="5.6">after it left the region that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="2731.9" dur="5.459">quiet it is they even know it was there</text>
  <text start="2734.8" dur="3.87">so we can see right now they have many</text>
  <text start="2737.359" dur="3.961">different missiles they have the new</text>
  <text start="2738.67" dur="4.21">s500 missile defense system which is</text>
  <text start="2741.32" dur="6.57">being developed right now which will be</text>
  <text start="2742.88" dur="6.66">out very soon this basically is going to</text>
  <text start="2747.89" dur="2.85">fundamentally change the balance of</text>
  <text start="2749.54" dur="4.2">power between the United States and</text>
  <text start="2750.74" dur="4.34">Russia once fully deployed the s500 will</text>
  <text start="2753.74" dur="3.27">be able to intercept our</text>
  <text start="2755.08" dur="3.88">intercontinental ballistic missiles this</text>
  <text start="2757.01" dur="4.14">means that the concept of mutually</text>
  <text start="2758.96" dur="6.33">assured destruction does not necessarily</text>
  <text start="2761.15" dur="7.92">apply any longer the s500 is not an</text>
  <text start="2765.29" dur="6.6">upgrade to the s400 but a new design it</text>
  <text start="2769.07" dur="5.789">uses a lot of new technology and a</text>
  <text start="2771.89" dur="4.5">superior to the s400 it was signed to</text>
  <text start="2774.859" dur="3.721">intercept ballistic missiles it is</text>
  <text start="2776.39" dur="4.29">planned to have a range of about 500 to</text>
  <text start="2778.58" dur="5.7">600 kilometres and hit a target of</text>
  <text start="2780.68" dur="8.04">altitudes about 40 kilometers and it</text>
  <text start="2784.28" dur="8.01">also can bring down low orbiting orbital</text>
  <text start="2788.72" dur="8.01">satellites so we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="2792.29" dur="6.78">that we do not want a war with a major</text>
  <text start="2796.73" dur="5.4">major power because it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="2799.07" dur="5.58">turn out well for anyone listen everyone</text>
  <text start="2802.13" dur="3.72">thanks a lot for listening be well be</text>
