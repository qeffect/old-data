  <text start="280.46" dur="4.08">deteriorating and it&amp;#39;s deteriorating</text>
  <text start="282.26" dur="3.87">very very quickly now of course if you</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="3.54">look at the stock market you look at</text>
  <text start="286.13" dur="3.539">unemployment GDP all the manipulative</text>
  <text start="288.08" dur="4.83">numbers from the government the central</text>

  <text start="292.91" dur="4.65">what&amp;#39;s happening in the background</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="5.77">actually it looks like 1929 2008 we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="297.56" dur="4.32">all eyes were on you know the stock</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="4.65">market and everything else but behind</text>
  <text start="301.88" dur="4.58">the scenes things were rapidly</text>
  <text start="304.49" dur="5.22">deteriorating and breaking apart</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="4.9">homebuilders well there they have this</text>
  <text start="309.71" dur="3.84">new sense of hope which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="311.36" dur="4.23">ridiculous but when we look at</text>
  <text start="313.55" dur="5.12">november&amp;#39;s data for housing</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="5.61">four starts and permits they collapsed</text>
  <text start="318.67" dur="5.77">mortgage apps are declining interest</text>
  <text start="321.2" dur="7.56">rates inched up a little bit and housing</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="5.82">starts crashed by 18.7 percent this is</text>
  <text start="328.76" dur="5.07">the biggest monthly plunge since the</text>
  <text start="330.26" dur="6.47">crisis peak in 2005 housing starts are</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="6">down six point nine percent year-on-year</text>
  <text start="336.73" dur="7.57">there&amp;#39;s a 43.9 percent collapse in</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="5.97">multifamily starts housing permits</text>
  <text start="344.3" dur="5.42">plunged by four-point-seven percent</text>
  <text start="345.8" dur="7.89">month on month what does this tell you</text>
  <text start="349.72" dur="7.87">things are breaking down very very</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="6">quickly and it tells you that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="357.59" dur="4.47">have that much more time until they</text>
  <text start="359.69" dur="5.66">bring down this economy remember they</text>
  <text start="362.06" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t want a Black Swan type of an event</text>
  <text start="365.35" dur="4.9">because they don&amp;#39;t have control over</text>
  <text start="367.43" dur="5.91">this they want to keep control because</text>
  <text start="370.25" dur="4.8">if a Black Swan event does occur let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.34" dur="3.39">say it happens out in Europe and a bank</text>
  <text start="375.05" dur="4.92">goes down like maybe Italy Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="376.73" dur="5.31">and that goes down and then it hits</text>
  <text start="379.97" dur="4.02">another bank and another bank and all of</text>
  <text start="382.04" dur="4.88">a sudden all the banks start crumbling</text>
  <text start="383.99" dur="5.31">and falling apart well remember the Fed</text>
  <text start="386.92" dur="5.05">the EU they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that the</text>
  <text start="389.3" dur="5.91">banks are strong they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="391.97" dur="5.37">these stress tests and if the economy</text>
  <text start="395.21" dur="3.36">comes down this way the people are going</text>
  <text start="397.34" dur="6.02">to look at the central bank&amp;#39;s and say</text>
  <text start="398.57" dur="7.98">this was your fault you lied to us and</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="6.88">we can see right now that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="406.55" dur="7.2">lying to us for a very long time we see</text>
  <text start="410.24" dur="7.29">the GDP numbers well they are being</text>
  <text start="413.75" dur="9.06">revised and revised and revised we see</text>
  <text start="417.53" dur="7.38">the now cast which predicts what the GDP</text>
  <text start="422.81" dur="5.34">is going to be it one from three percent</text>
  <text start="424.91" dur="6.3">to two-point-eight percent 2.2% it is</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="5.04">down to one point eight percent now for</text>
  <text start="431.21" dur="3.84">the fourth quarter Wow we went from</text>
  <text start="433.19" dur="3.15">three point two percent it&amp;#39;s going down</text>
  <text start="435.05" dur="2.22">one point eight percent of course the</text>
  <text start="436.34" dur="3.6">government didn&amp;#39;t come up with their</text>
  <text start="437.27" dur="3.81">numbers and we know that they manipulate</text>
  <text start="439.94" dur="3.18">those numbers but that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="441.08" dur="3.87">predicting right now so you can see</text>
  <text start="443.12" dur="3.87">where we stand most likely if you take</text>
  <text start="444.95" dur="4.28">out research and development Obamacare</text>
  <text start="446.99" dur="5.78">and everything like that GDP</text>
  <text start="449.23" dur="7.29">zero or negative and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="452.77" dur="7.05">stock market well the markets are</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="6.51">priming for a major inflection point the</text>
  <text start="459.82" dur="5.04">dow is currently more overbought based</text>
  <text start="463.03" dur="6.38">on the 14-day relative strength index</text>
  <text start="464.86" dur="8.55">than at any point in the last 20 years</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="7.89">that includes the peak of the housing</text>
  <text start="473.41" dur="7.89">bubble and the peak of the tech bubble</text>
  <text start="477.3" dur="6.3">most likely this is all going to start</text>
  <text start="481.3" dur="4.44">to fall apart in the year of 2017 and</text>
  <text start="483.6" dur="4.93">then for those people who look at</text>
  <text start="485.74" dur="6.84">numbers if you notice 2017 has the</text>
  <text start="488.53" dur="6.39">number 7 in it and we&amp;#39;ve noticed in the</text>
  <text start="492.58" dur="6.18">past people pointed out that central</text>
  <text start="494.92" dur="6.42">bankers like to have their events with</text>
  <text start="498.76" dur="8.46">the number 7 in it so this is very</text>
  <text start="501.34" dur="8.01">interesting as we approach 2017 now a</text>
  <text start="507.22" dur="5.28">couple reports ago we talked about quad</text>
  <text start="509.35" dur="7.47">witching and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="512.5" dur="9.66">quad witching well it has arrived it has</text>
  <text start="516.82" dur="7.98">arrived today which means that things</text>
  <text start="522.16" dur="6.12">are going to start to really break apart</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="8.19">they&amp;#39;re going to be volatile we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="528.28" dur="6.84">to see moves that are erratic and we can</text>
  <text start="532.99" dur="6.24">see right now we&amp;#39;re starting to see this</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="6.63">a little bit we see out in Europe stocks</text>
  <text start="539.23" dur="6.48">move from session lows to highs and the</text>
  <text start="541.75" dur="5.79">span of minutes we see the yield on the</text>
  <text start="545.71" dur="4.8">10-year Treasury drop from the highest</text>
  <text start="547.54" dur="5.37">since 2014 snapping a six-day streak</text>
  <text start="550.51" dur="4.32">higher underpinned by the feds more</text>
  <text start="552.91" dur="6.12">hawkish outlook for interest rate</text>
  <text start="554.83" dur="6.75">increase next year and we see that the</text>
  <text start="559.03" dur="5.94">US equity market open was a chaotic</text>
  <text start="561.58" dur="6.96">scene of volatility complex tails equity</text>
  <text start="564.97" dur="6.57">markets top runs VIX and stocks tumbling</text>
  <text start="568.54" dur="6.48">together and we can see this is the</text>
  <text start="571.54" dur="6.99">beginning and things are rapidly falling</text>
  <text start="575.02" dur="6.6">apart now doug casey is out there saying</text>
  <text start="578.53" dur="4.57">at this point you should be selling all</text>
  <text start="581.62" dur="3.85">your bonds</text>
  <text start="583.1" dur="5.61">the bond market going to be a disaster</text>
  <text start="585.47" dur="8.49">get out of it right now at the same time</text>
  <text start="588.71" dur="8.81">all of this is happening China they are</text>
  <text start="593.96" dur="6.98">dumping Treasuries not just China</text>

  <text start="606.59" dur="4.17">back in time and we look at the latest</text>
  <text start="608.93" dur="4.38">monthly Treasury international capital</text>
  <text start="610.76" dur="4.62">data for the month of October which</text>
  <text start="613.31" dur="4.32">showed that the troubling trend</text>
  <text start="615.38" dur="5.4">presented one month ago has accelerated</text>
  <text start="617.63" dur="6.33">to an unprecedented degree we call that</text>
  <text start="620.78" dur="6.44">in mid-november we reported that in the</text>

  <text start="634.79" dur="7.76">2016 this was completely unprecedented</text>
  <text start="638" dur="6.42">in size now let&amp;#39;s fast-forward to today</text>
  <text start="642.55" dur="4.24">when we look at the latest monthly</text>
  <text start="644.42" dur="7.17">update for the month of October we find</text>
  <text start="646.79" dur="7.88">that until a month ago it was 375</text>

  <text start="671.6" dur="5.94">period in history and of course the</text>
