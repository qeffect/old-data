  <text start="87.53" dur="6.84">the IG separate the coma report from the</text>
  <text start="90.5" dur="6.15">Pfizer why was it a separate report this</text>
  <text start="94.37" dur="4.679">was a very important step in the plan</text>
  <text start="96.65" dur="6.03">the Patriots needed to establish that</text>
  <text start="99.049" dur="6.211">Comey was above FBI policies pursuing a</text>
  <text start="102.68" dur="4.32">political agenda took classified</text>
  <text start="105.26" dur="4.38">information leaked it out to the</text>

  <text start="109.64" dur="5.64">there are two sets of laws or rules one</text>
  <text start="113.09" dur="4.65">for the people and the other was for the</text>
  <text start="115.28" dur="5.4">deep state and the question is if he was</text>
  <text start="117.74" dur="6.419">able to do all of this what else was he</text>
  <text start="120.68" dur="8.61">capable of think about it he violated</text>
  <text start="124.159" dur="9.631">FBI policies 25 times not once not twice</text>
  <text start="129.29" dur="7.25">not three times it was 25 times this</text>
  <text start="133.79" dur="7.41">wasn&amp;#39;t an accident this was premeditated</text>
  <text start="136.54" dur="9.34">planned so if he was able to do all of</text>
  <text start="141.2" dur="6.12">this what else is he capable of we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="145.88" dur="3.48">talking about this a little bit later in</text>
  <text start="147.32" dur="5.639">this report but first it seems that</text>
  <text start="149.36" dur="6.42">Patriots found another leaker now this</text>
  <text start="152.959" dur="5.341">is Trump&amp;#39;s personal assistant she</text>
  <text start="155.78" dur="5.13">resigned and she was leaking out</text>
  <text start="158.3" dur="3.83">information her name is Madeleine</text>
  <text start="160.91" dur="3.05">Western out</text>
  <text start="162.13" dur="3.84">she resigned after she was caught</text>
  <text start="163.96" dur="5.7">leaking details about Trump&amp;#39;s family and</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="6.18">Oval Office operation to reporters now</text>
  <text start="169.66" dur="4.71">western help joined Trump&amp;#39;s transition</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="6.21">team from the RNC and was not considered</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="5.79">a trump loyalists in the past six months</text>
  <text start="178.36" dur="3.99">Westar Houghton had tried to expand the</text>
  <text start="180.16" dur="4.32">boundaries of her job to encompass a</text>
  <text start="182.35" dur="4.32">broader set of tasks and to include</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="4.14">foreign travel said one of eyes are</text>
  <text start="186.67" dur="4.26">close to the White House who suggested</text>
  <text start="188.62" dur="5.16">that West are out had tried to act like</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="5.01">a de facto chief of staff and this</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="4.02">worked several White House officials</text>
  <text start="195.94" dur="4.02">cabinet secretaries who thought she</text>
  <text start="197.8" dur="3.84">should stick to her primary task of</text>
  <text start="199.96" dur="4.38">serving as the president&amp;#39;s personal</text>
  <text start="201.64" dur="6.09">secretary with a dusk a desk just</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="5.85">outside the Oval Office and again here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="207.73" dur="5.22">another individual that was leaking</text>
  <text start="210.19" dur="6.03">information I wonder how much they paid</text>
  <text start="212.95" dur="6.78">her because you know she was receiving</text>
  <text start="216.22" dur="6.72">funds for what she was dishing out so</text>
  <text start="219.73" dur="4.47">let&amp;#39;s review what&amp;#39;s in this report now</text>
  <text start="222.94" dur="7.4">like we said</text>
  <text start="224.2" dur="8.06">Kumi he violated FBI policies 25 times</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="4.36">here a couple of them</text>
  <text start="232.26" dur="4.54">Comey did not seek authorization from</text>
  <text start="234.7" dur="4.35">the FBI before providing memos two four</text>
  <text start="236.8" dur="4.86">six and seven to his attorneys this was</text>
  <text start="239.05" dur="4.2">on page 2 Comey did not seek FBI</text>
  <text start="241.66" dur="4.5">authorization before providing the</text>
  <text start="243.25" dur="5.67">contents of memo 4 through richmond to a</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="5.37">reporter this is on page 2 as described</text>
  <text start="248.92" dur="4.83">in this report we conclude that commis</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="4.53">retention handling and dissemination of</text>
  <text start="253.75" dur="4.5">certain memos violated apartment and FBI</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="6.66">policies and his FBI employment</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="6.48">agreement page 3 Comey told the OIG that</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="4.11">he did not notify anyone that the FBI</text>
  <text start="264.73" dur="3.84">that he was going to share these memos</text>
  <text start="266.83" dur="3.96">with anyone and did not seek</text>
  <text start="268.57" dur="4.77">authorization from the FBI prior to</text>
  <text start="270.79" dur="6.12">emailing these four memos to Fitzgerald</text>
  <text start="273.34" dur="5.67">page 38 accordingly Comey stated that he</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="3.9">did not notify anyone at the FBI that he</text>
  <text start="279.01" dur="3.78">was going to share the contents of the</text>
  <text start="280.81" dur="3.78">memo full with Richmond or the media and</text>
  <text start="282.79" dur="5.04">that he did not seek authorization from</text>
  <text start="284.59" dur="5.539">FBI to provide memo for to Richmond page</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="5.479">40 and it goes on and</text>
  <text start="290.129" dur="7.26">on and on and like I said before he</text>
  <text start="293.309" dur="7.051">violated the FBI policies 25 times they</text>
  <text start="297.389" dur="6.84">wanted this out there to show everyone</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="9.989">that he does truly believe that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.229" dur="8.881">above the law above the policies and if</text>
  <text start="310.349" dur="6.84">he can do this what else does he think</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="7.44">he&amp;#39;s above and all to push a political</text>
  <text start="317.189" dur="6.57">agenda think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="320.55" dur="7.589">this is why they put this out there this</text>
  <text start="323.759" dur="9.81">is the introduction to let you know how</text>
  <text start="328.139" dur="8.161">these people act and how they think of</text>
  <text start="333.569" dur="7.261">themselves I mean he was the director of</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="5.269">the FBI and he was not following any of</text>
  <text start="340.83" dur="5.399">the rules</text>
  <text start="341.569" dur="7.541">he imagined everyone else in the FBI now</text>
  <text start="346.229" dur="4.71">the report concluded that James Comey</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="3.899">violated Department and FBI policies</text>
  <text start="350.939" dur="4.2">pertaining to the retention handling and</text>
  <text start="353.009" dur="4.981">dissemination of FBI records and</text>
  <text start="355.139" dur="5.7">information the Comey report concluded</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="5.399">that FBI director former FBI director</text>
  <text start="360.839" dur="5.88">James Comey stole memos and kept them at</text>
  <text start="363.389" dur="5.76">his home but FBI officials cleared Comey</text>
  <text start="366.719" dur="4.73">saying the stolen documents did not</text>
  <text start="369.149" dur="4.83">contain classified material only</text>
  <text start="371.449" dur="4.75">confidential material so who are these</text>
  <text start="373.979" dur="4.62">people that made the determination that</text>
  <text start="376.199" dur="5.34">they were not classified material only</text>
  <text start="378.599" dur="6.42">confidential material well it was bill</text>
  <text start="381.539" dur="5.97">priest AB James Baker Lisa Paige Peter</text>
  <text start="385.019" dur="5.55">struck those four people got together</text>
  <text start="387.509" dur="7.291">and said hey let&amp;#39;s categorize these</text>
  <text start="390.569" dur="5.93">memos and the ones that call me took we</text>
  <text start="394.8" dur="4.979">determine are confidential and not</text>
  <text start="396.499" dur="5.56">felonies and the ones he left behind we</text>
  <text start="399.779" dur="4.14">will say are classified but he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="402.059" dur="5.76">subject to criminal exposure because he</text>
  <text start="403.919" dur="7.26">didn&amp;#39;t take those three home so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="407.819" dur="7.291">say Comey violated FBI policies 25 times</text>
  <text start="411.179" dur="7.35">and he had help from the same exact</text>
  <text start="415.11" dur="7.769">players who decided they weren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="418.529" dur="5.751">to follow FBI policies priest Abbe Baker</text>
  <text start="422.879" dur="4.29">paid struck</text>
  <text start="424.28" dur="7.3">they were all in on it we already knew</text>
  <text start="427.169" dur="8.071">this we knew that all these people work</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="7.709">together and they had one mission remove</text>
  <text start="435.24" dur="6.72">Trump set him up now</text>
  <text start="439.289" dur="5.491">the report cites witnesses who said that</text>
  <text start="441.96" dur="4.709">the FBI and Comey wanted to use the</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="3.99">briefing to collect information that</text>
  <text start="446.669" dur="4.05">could be used in the Russian probe</text>
  <text start="448.77" dur="3.75">come--as said that he had the meeting</text>
  <text start="450.719" dur="4.611">with Trump merely to give him a heads-up</text>
  <text start="452.52" dur="5.04">that the dossier might be published</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="5.769">representative Jim Jordan says the</text>
  <text start="457.56" dur="8.25">findings suggest that Comey was out to</text>
  <text start="461.099" dur="8.401">get the president now we know that Comey</text>
  <text start="465.81" dur="5.55">drafted seven memos stemming from nine</text>
  <text start="469.5" dur="4.56">conversations he had with Trump</text>
  <text start="471.36" dur="5.07">beginning January 7 2017 through April</text>
  <text start="474.06" dur="3.99">2017 and this is according to the</text>
  <text start="476.43" dur="5.07">Freedom of Information Act Docs</text>

  <text start="500.039" dur="5.791">IG report shortly after commis removal a</text>
  <text start="503.639" dur="5.101">set of the seven memos was provided to</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="5.73">the OIG by but by a department employee</text>
  <text start="508.74" dur="5.01">who claimed whistleblower status this</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="4.26">individual viewed the memos is extremely</text>
  <text start="513.75" dur="4.62">sensitive documents and was concerned</text>
  <text start="515.82" dur="5.009">that there should be a separate set</text>
  <text start="518.37" dur="5.159">deposited somewhere for safekeeping the</text>

  <text start="523.529" dur="3.481">consistent with the requirements for</text>
  <text start="525.329" dur="4.591">classified information even though only</text>
  <text start="527.01" dur="6.689">memo one had any classification markings</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="6.06">at the time so who is the FBI Department</text>
  <text start="533.699" dur="5.521">of Justice whistleblower as of right now</text>

  <text start="552.27" dur="2.96">interviewed by John Durham and the FBI</text>
  <text start="554.279" dur="2.751">in fact</text>
  <text start="555.23" dur="4.44">there is no way you can finish this</text>
  <text start="557.03" dur="4.29">investigation without interviewing the</text>
  <text start="559.67" dur="3.33">former president of the United States</text>
  <text start="561.32" dur="4.59">because his national security adviser</text>
  <text start="563" dur="6.84">said bingo he was at the head of it and</text>
  <text start="565.91" dur="6.18">he has to do this under oath think about</text>
  <text start="569.84" dur="5.25">this for a second you think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="572.09" dur="6">saving this you think this is the grand</text>
  <text start="575.09" dur="6.06">finale maybe Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="578.09" dur="5.37">following the disastrous IG report on</text>
  <text start="581.15" dur="5.79">James Comey shows in the strongest of</text>
  <text start="583.46" dur="5.01">terms how unfairly I and tens of</text>
  <text start="586.94" dur="4.05">millions of great people who support me</text>
  <text start="588.47" dur="5.16">were treated our rights and liberties</text>

  <text start="593.63" dur="5.13">dishonest fool which should be given our</text>
  <text start="596.15" dur="5.04">stolen time back think about what he</text>

  <text start="611.48" dur="5.28">take Comey and others to task makes no</text>
  <text start="614.21" dur="3.24">sense not to prosecute him Comey got a</text>

  <text start="617.45" dur="4.47">I fear from my country he tried to</text>
  <text start="619.97" dur="5.37">kneecap our duly elected president and</text>
  <text start="621.92" dur="5.7">there are no consequences Trump tweeted</text>
  <text start="625.34" dur="5.04">out once again the fact that James Comey</text>
  <text start="627.62" dur="5.37">was not prosecuted for the absolutely</text>
  <text start="630.38" dur="5.25">horrible thing he did just shows how</text>
  <text start="632.99" dur="5.31">fair and reasonable attorney general</text>
  <text start="635.63" dur="4.8">bill Barr is so many people and experts</text>
  <text start="638.3" dur="5.04">that I&amp;#39;ve watched and read would have</text>
  <text start="640.43" dur="3.9">taken an entirely different course Comey</text>
  <text start="643.34" dur="5.25">got lucky</text>
  <text start="644.33" dur="6.06">so he&amp;#39;s letting everyone know that Comey</text>
  <text start="648.59" dur="4.46">should have been prosecuted of course</text>
  <text start="650.39" dur="5.79">but why waste time on these memos</text>
  <text start="653.05" dur="7.24">showing that bill Barr is fair and</text>
  <text start="656.18" dur="6.87">reasonable that he&amp;#39;s just not going</text>
  <text start="660.29" dur="4.71">after people just to go after people if</text>
  <text start="663.05" dur="5.04">he sees something there</text>
  <text start="665" dur="6.15">go prosecute if he doesn&amp;#39;t he will not</text>
  <text start="668.09" dur="6.54">why is Trump doing this why is he</text>
  <text start="671.15" dur="5.43">letting everyone know look Barr didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="674.63" dur="5.94">go after him this is not a witch-hunt</text>
  <text start="676.58" dur="7.65">like Muller this is a fair and</text>
  <text start="680.57" dur="6.39">reasonable attorney general he&amp;#39;s not out</text>
