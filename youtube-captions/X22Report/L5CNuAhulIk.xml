  <text start="663.89" dur="7.02">migration measures they are working now</text>
  <text start="667.88" dur="5.76">when you compare this from July to</text>
  <text start="670.91" dur="3.24">August of the last eight of the last ten</text>
  <text start="673.64" dur="4.92">years</text>
  <text start="674.15" dur="7.26">it shows that this drop is not related</text>
  <text start="678.56" dur="6.27">to a recent historical pattern that this</text>
  <text start="681.41" dur="6.33">drop is because of what the Trump</text>
  <text start="684.83" dur="6.05">administration is doing so normally</text>
  <text start="687.74" dur="6.24">there is no drop in July in August and</text>
  <text start="690.88" dur="5.56">if you go back 8 and 10 years it shows</text>
  <text start="693.98" dur="4.98">that yeah this is not a pattern we don&amp;#39;t</text>
