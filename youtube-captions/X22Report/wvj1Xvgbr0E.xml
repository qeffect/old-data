  <text start="120.2" dur="4.169">pushing the idea that we need to go</text>
  <text start="122.869" dur="3.75">cashless and we discussed this many</text>
  <text start="124.369" dur="4.951">times before but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="126.619" dur="4.951">now from the banks is they are</text>
  <text start="129.32" dur="4.65">definitely making this push and it looks</text>
  <text start="131.57" dur="5.34">like they&amp;#39;re trying to track who has</text>
  <text start="133.97" dur="6.42">cash and who is using cash because</text>
  <text start="136.91" dur="5.97">coming from JPMorgan Chase we see they</text>
  <text start="140.39" dur="7.349">changed some of their policies about</text>
  <text start="142.88" dur="8.07">cash and starting March 2016 when anyone</text>

  <text start="150.95" dur="5.27">payment for a loan or credit card you</text>

  <text start="158.389" dur="5.761">them is to make a cash deposit or</text>

  <text start="195.5" dur="4.53">completely step away from cash and we</text>
  <text start="198.139" dur="4.02">see that the banks are going to be</text>
  <text start="200.03" dur="5.429">making this push because we realize what</text>
  <text start="202.159" dur="4.711">is coming down the pike here and this is</text>
  <text start="205.459" dur="3.541">why they&amp;#39;ve been preparing and getting</text>
  <text start="206.87" dur="5.25">ready to bail in documents we see the</text>
  <text start="209" dur="5.43">economy is slowly and surely slipping</text>
  <text start="212.12" dur="5.28">into this devastating collapse and it is</text>
  <text start="214.43" dur="5.22">going to get worse and bill halter is</text>
  <text start="217.4" dur="5.399">out there and he&amp;#39;s saying one of the</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="8.239">ways to see this coming one of the signs</text>
  <text start="222.799" dur="8.55">is when the comex fails to deliver on</text>
  <text start="227.889" dur="6.07">gold and he&amp;#39;s saying that the situation</text>
  <text start="231.349" dur="5.07">can only last or continue as long as</text>
  <text start="233.959" dur="4.831">volts have gold and the owners are</text>
  <text start="236.419" dur="4.831">willing to fill the deficit between</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="5.849">supply and demand the global financial</text>
  <text start="241.25" dur="7.019">system it&amp;#39;s going to completely seized</text>
  <text start="244.639" dur="6.331">up and closed for trading once gold</text>
  <text start="248.269" dur="4.981">delivery fails and he&amp;#39;s saying this will</text>
  <text start="250.97" dur="6.75">only take about 48 hours after the</text>
  <text start="253.25" dur="8.549">failure and after the failure the</text>
  <text start="257.72" dur="7.439">ability to procure metals sell stocks or</text>
  <text start="261.799" dur="8.161">bonds or do anything else financial at</text>
  <text start="265.159" dur="7.23">that point it will not be an option he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.96" dur="5.55">saying that the pace of the collapse has</text>
  <text start="272.389" dur="5.34">shifted gears as evidenced by trade</text>
  <text start="275.51" dur="5.45">earnings and even central bank&amp;#39;s Japan&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.729" dur="5.93">new policy of negative interest rates is</text>
  <text start="280.96" dur="4.84">showing that there is stress and</text>
  <text start="283.659" dur="5.711">everything is starting to break down</text>
  <text start="285.8" dur="5.7">right now and we can see it from</text>
  <text start="289.37" dur="3.26">everything that we talked about where</text>
  <text start="291.5" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re looking at the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="5.29">GDP unemployment retail stores closing</text>
  <text start="296.33" dur="4.86">going bankrupt</text>
  <text start="297.92" dur="4.77">we see corporations with mass layoffs we</text>
  <text start="301.19" dur="3.84">see the unemployment numbers of course</text>
  <text start="302.69" dur="4.65">which are completely manipulated it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.03" dur="5.07">all starting to break down and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.34" dur="7.05">seeing major major fluctuations in the</text>
  <text start="310.1" dur="7.65">market now on to Zika we realize that</text>
  <text start="314.39" dur="5.4">the government&amp;#39;s the World Health</text>
  <text start="317.75" dur="3.24">Organization and of course the CDC</text>
  <text start="319.79" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re coming up with their computer</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="5.1">model to let us know how many people are</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="4.61">going to be infected but we know at this</text>
  <text start="326.09" dur="4.62">point that things aren&amp;#39;t making sense</text>
  <text start="327.82" dur="6.19">because we&amp;#39;ve seen the study of how many</text>
  <text start="330.71" dur="6.33">people how many cases are reported with</text>
  <text start="334.01" dur="5.49">microcephaly and how many people</text>
  <text start="337.04" dur="4.32">actually have it and then how many</text>
  <text start="339.5" dur="3.72">people actually had the Zika virus at</text>
  <text start="341.36" dur="3.09">the same time and all of this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="3.63">make sense because after the four</text>
  <text start="344.45" dur="5.42">thousand or so people that are reported</text>
  <text start="346.85" dur="6.63">to have microcephaly there was only 267</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="5.56">cases confirmed and out of the 267 only</text>
  <text start="353.48" dur="6.99">six people had the Zika virus as there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.43" dur="6.98">no correlation on any of this and right</text>
  <text start="360.47" dur="5.85">now they&amp;#39;re doing something very odd</text>
  <text start="362.41" dur="7.83">they&amp;#39;re telling women to hold off</text>
  <text start="366.32" dur="3.92">getting pregnant for at least two years</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="7.18">without doing any conclusive scientific</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="7.92">study or any type of evidence to back</text>
  <text start="378.23" dur="7.35">any of this up and all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="382.94" dur="5.16">see announcements from international</text>
  <text start="385.58" dur="4.68">pharmaceutical giants saying that</text>
  <text start="388.1" dur="7.32">they&amp;#39;re already creating or have a</text>
  <text start="390.26" dur="7.38">vaccine for Zika one Indian drug</text>
  <text start="395.42" dur="4.26">manufacturer has already announced it</text>
  <text start="397.64" dur="3.9">has developed a Zika vaccine other</text>
  <text start="399.68" dur="6.03">manufacturers are saying they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="401.54" dur="5.37">close so they already knew that this was</text>
  <text start="405.71" dur="3.06">going to problem they already had this</text>
  <text start="406.91" dur="3.93">in development and they were all ready</text>
  <text start="408.77" dur="5.21">to push this out and it&amp;#39;s just very odd</text>
  <text start="410.84" dur="6.03">how this all of a sudden came out at the</text>
  <text start="413.98" dur="6.46">exact moment when they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="416.87" dur="7.8">to push vaccines we see that facebook</text>
  <text start="420.44" dur="7.17">right now is now removing speech that</text>
  <text start="424.67" dur="6.6">presumably almost everyone everybody</text>
  <text start="427.61" dur="5.37">might decide is racist oh</text>
  <text start="431.27" dur="5.1">with speech that only someone at</text>
  <text start="432.98" dur="6.99">Facebook decides is racist what does</text>
  <text start="436.37" dur="6.2">this mean it means we are starting to</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="5.7">see what is called controlled or</text>
  <text start="442.57" dur="5.83">permitted speech is going to be a body</text>
  <text start="445.67" dur="5.25">of people who will then decide if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="6.02">racist were not racist and they will</text>
  <text start="450.92" dur="7.47">decide what is free speech and what is</text>
  <text start="454.42" dur="6.94">controlled speech this is exactly how it</text>
  <text start="458.39" dur="5.19">begins and then they push it a little</text>
  <text start="461.36" dur="6.48">bit further then a little bit further</text>
  <text start="463.58" dur="8.52">and we see that German Chancellor Angela</text>
  <text start="467.84" dur="7.8">Merkel and Mark Zuckerberg they were at</text>
  <text start="472.1" dur="5.82">a UN development summit in New York they</text>
  <text start="475.64" dur="6.14">sat down there was an open microphone</text>
  <text start="477.92" dur="6.02">and we see Merkel was asking Zuckerberg</text>
  <text start="481.78" dur="4.87">you know what could be done to stop</text>
  <text start="483.94" dur="7.27">anti-immigration postings being written</text>
  <text start="486.65" dur="6.12">on Facebook and he kind of answered were</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="4.17">already working on that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="492.77" dur="5.79">stop that from happening now just a few</text>
  <text start="495.38" dur="6.45">weeks ago Facebook was forced to back</text>
  <text start="498.56" dur="7.38">down when caught permitting anti-israel</text>
  <text start="501.83" dur="8.49">postings but censoring equivalent anti</text>
  <text start="505.94" dur="8.82">Palestinian postings because what</text>
  <text start="510.32" dur="6.33">happens here is that those people who</text>
  <text start="514.76" dur="4.2">think that yes we&amp;#39;re permitting free</text>
  <text start="516.65" dur="4.59">speech they&amp;#39;re really controlling and</text>
  <text start="518.96" dur="3.24">permitting the speech they want remember</text>
  <text start="521.24" dur="3.18">everyone comes from a different</text>
  <text start="522.2" dur="4.92">background different religion different</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="4.65">political views and certain groups have</text>
  <text start="527.12" dur="4.47">different views than other groups so</text>
  <text start="529.07" dur="5.37">which group is right and this is why the</text>
  <text start="531.59" dur="4.89">founding fathers said no this is all</text>
  <text start="534.44" dur="5.1">free speech if you don&amp;#39;t want to listen</text>
  <text start="536.48" dur="6.39">to it don&amp;#39;t listen to it but you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="539.54" dur="4.8">say oh we like this speech instead of</text>
  <text start="542.87" dur="2.84">that speech because it&amp;#39;s not free then</text>
  <text start="544.34" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s controlled it&amp;#39;s permitted and</text>
  <text start="545.71" dur="4.15">everyone has a completely different</text>
  <text start="547.91" dur="4.77">background the group of people that</text>
  <text start="549.86" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re putting together to view which</text>
  <text start="552.68" dur="5.61">speech is good or bad has a completely</text>
  <text start="554.84" dur="6.33">different political religious type of</text>
  <text start="558.29" dur="5.31">background then other people and this is</text>
  <text start="561.17" dur="3.99">why it&amp;#39;s so important that everyone have</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="3.75">the right to talk</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="4.169">really about any group at any time now</text>
  <text start="567.35" dur="3.479">if you don&amp;#39;t want to listen to it don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="569.329" dur="2.911">listen to it just like on the TV if you</text>
  <text start="570.829" dur="2.911">don&amp;#39;t want to listen to that station you</text>
  <text start="572.24" dur="3.48">turn to a different station if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="573.74" dur="6.06">want to watch a movie or show you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="575.72" dur="5.989">do it you send your message that way but</text>
  <text start="579.8" dur="5.19">we see what they&amp;#39;re trying to do here</text>
  <text start="581.709" dur="5.141">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop people from</text>
  <text start="584.99" dur="4.589">speaking freely and they do this very</text>
  <text start="586.85" dur="5.19">slowly it&amp;#39;s almost like taxing when they</text>
  <text start="589.579" dur="4.74">say oh we&amp;#39;re going to tax the rich then</text>
  <text start="592.04" dur="3.779">we&amp;#39;re only going to tax the kind of rich</text>
  <text start="594.319" dur="2.401">then we&amp;#39;re going to tax only the middle</text>
  <text start="595.819" dur="3.06">class and they brought it all the way</text>
  <text start="596.72" dur="3.69">down the poor they start at the upper</text>
  <text start="598.879" dur="4.02">level when people go yes we have to stop</text>
  <text start="600.41" dur="6.27">braces we have to stop hate speech and</text>
  <text start="602.899" dur="5.79">then they slowly take away more and more</text>
  <text start="606.68" dur="5.089">and more and this is how they get people</text>
  <text start="608.689" dur="7.041">into it this is how they get their</text>
  <text start="611.769" dur="6.88">agenda pushed forward Twitter right now</text>
  <text start="615.73" dur="5.049">they&amp;#39;ve shut down more than 125</text>
  <text start="618.649" dur="3.3">terrorism-related accounts how did they</text>
  <text start="620.779" dur="3.99">do this well they have a team of people</text>
  <text start="621.949" dur="5.49">who look at it and say yeah they said</text>
  <text start="624.769" dur="3.93">something about this Islam or something</text>
  <text start="627.439" dur="6.15">else and we&amp;#39;re just going to take it</text>
  <text start="628.699" dur="6.24">down now do we really know that this is</text>
  <text start="633.589" dur="2.971">what it was all about this is what the</text>
  <text start="634.939" dur="3.9">Twitter feed was all about no we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="636.56" dur="5.06">and this is kind of scary too because</text>
  <text start="638.839" dur="5.041">anyone out there mentioning anything or</text>
  <text start="641.62" dur="5.98">anyone that has an opposing or a</text>

  <text start="649.069" dur="5.731">racist terror let&amp;#39;s just take it down</text>
  <text start="652.279" dur="4.771">and this is how it begins and this is</text>
  <text start="654.8" dur="5.279">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now so after a</text>
  <text start="657.05" dur="4.769">12-year legal battle we see the US</text>

  <text start="720.29" dur="6.81">colorful it is when they want to point</text>

  <text start="734.089" dur="4.771">right out of the open I mean they would</text>
  <text start="737.18" dur="4.89">have it underground they would have it</text>
  <text start="738.86" dur="5.61">hidden they wouldn&amp;#39;t have a launch tower</text>

  <text start="744.47" dur="4.11">rocket into space to put up a</text>
  <text start="746.57" dur="3.84">communication satellite but it&amp;#39;s amazing</text>
  <text start="748.58" dur="3.87">how the u.s. can come up with a</text>
  <text start="750.41" dur="4.89">perfectly clear satellite picture</text>
  <text start="752.45" dur="4.74">compared to the Ukraine when they were</text>
  <text start="755.3" dur="4.2">trying to show Russia invading and it</text>
  <text start="757.19" dur="5.12">was blurred black and white and you</text>
  <text start="759.5" dur="8.1">couldn&amp;#39;t make anything because it was so</text>
  <text start="762.31" dur="7.57">bad that it didn&amp;#39;t show anything now</text>
  <text start="767.6" dur="4.53">Turkey is trying to shut their borders</text>
  <text start="769.88" dur="4.14">they do not want the refugees coming in</text>
  <text start="772.13" dur="4.17">from Syria as Russia continually bombs</text>

  <text start="789.05" dur="4.46">states you have to take in the refugees</text>
  <text start="791.75" dur="6.17">but we see what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="793.51" dur="8.17">turkey is building up a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="797.92" dur="7.24">military troops on the border military</text>
  <text start="801.68" dur="5.43">assets jeh Johnson is in Turkey helping</text>
  <text start="805.16" dur="5.66">them secure the borders and the question</text>

  <text start="810.82" dur="5.139">securing the borders why is jay johnson</text>
  <text start="814.459" dur="3.991">there why are they thinking about</text>
  <text start="815.959" dur="5.07">erecting a wall why are they monitoring</text>
  <text start="818.45" dur="6.24">the borders because when turkey attacks</text>

  <text start="829.4" dur="5.16">factions out of there</text>
  <text start="831.92" dur="4.2">tree and we can see this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="834.56" dur="4.279">they&amp;#39;re doing we&amp;#39;re getting confirmation</text>
  <text start="836.12" dur="5.7">right now that Saudi Arabia has</text>
  <text start="838.839" dur="6.761">mercenaries at least a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="841.82" dur="6.6">thousand mercenaries ready to go to go</text>

  <text start="865.279" dur="4.74">mercenaries they&amp;#39;ve been training them</text>
  <text start="867.11" dur="5.19">remember all of these training centers</text>
  <text start="870.019" dur="6.841">that are that that they erected in</text>
  <text start="872.3" dur="6.899">Jordan in Saudi Arabia in Qatar well</text>
  <text start="876.86" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re continually training paid</text>
  <text start="879.199" dur="6.031">mercenaries and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="881.54" dur="6.15">using these mercenaries to invade Syria</text>
  <text start="885.23" dur="5.94">and they&amp;#39;re just waiting for the go</text>
  <text start="887.69" dur="5.88">ahead from the US the US now is setting</text>
  <text start="891.17" dur="5.039">up their airbase in Syria which outlet</text>

  <text start="896.209" dur="2.461">government they&amp;#39;re not even supposed to</text>
  <text start="897.35" dur="4.26">be there actually this is an act of war</text>
  <text start="898.67" dur="4.74">they went into a country they</text>
  <text start="901.61" dur="4.05">commandeered an airbase they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="903.41" dur="5.21">extending the airbase from 700 meters to</text>
  <text start="905.66" dur="6.419">1,300 meters so they can land c-130</text>
  <text start="908.62" dur="6.76">transport planes and doing this without</text>
  <text start="912.079" dur="5.541">the permission of the government and we</text>
  <text start="915.38" dur="6.6">can see all of this is in preparation</text>
  <text start="917.62" dur="7">for a major major offensive which most</text>
  <text start="921.98" dur="5.16">likely will kick off World War 3 but the</text>
  <text start="924.62" dur="5.25">question we have to ask is they just</text>
  <text start="927.14" dur="4.819">can&amp;#39;t go in there and invade what are</text>
  <text start="929.87" dur="6.62">they going to do to convince the world</text>
