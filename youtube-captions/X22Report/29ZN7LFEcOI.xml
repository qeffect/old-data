  <text start="23.14" dur="6.479">hi and welcome to the x 22 report my</text>
  <text start="26.599" dur="5.701">name is dave and this is episode 75 and</text>
  <text start="29.619" dur="6.15">today&amp;#39;s title of this episode is bubbles</text>
  <text start="32.3" dur="7.429">bubbles the economic collapse bubble and</text>
  <text start="35.769" dur="8.801">we&amp;#39;ll see why we&amp;#39;re calling this the</text>
  <text start="39.729" dur="8.771">major major be-all end-all of all</text>
  <text start="44.57" dur="8.669">bubbles but let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="48.5" dur="7.979">economic collapse news and basically the</text>
  <text start="53.239" dur="7.581">Swiss banks forced to disclose us client</text>
  <text start="56.479" dur="8.25">names in tax evasion disputes basically</text>
  <text start="60.82" dur="9.25">like I said before when we see the</text>
  <text start="64.729" dur="10.291">government adding more taxes on to the</text>
  <text start="70.07" dur="8.82">people or even looking for those people</text>
  <text start="75.02" dur="10.44">that owe taxes and going outside of the</text>
  <text start="78.89" dur="10.2">country and forcing other countries to</text>
  <text start="85.46" dur="8.85">give up the names of these people you</text>
  <text start="89.09" dur="11.1">know we are at the end game of this</text>
  <text start="94.31" dur="9.72">entire monetary system I mean they are</text>
  <text start="100.19" dur="10.08">looking everywhere and anywhere to get</text>
  <text start="104.03" dur="7.65">revenue to pay the debt the interest on</text>
  <text start="110.27" dur="5.37">the debt because what they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="111.68" dur="7.729">in now in tax revenue is no way enough</text>
  <text start="115.64" dur="7.05">and we have I mean right now we have 17</text>
  <text start="119.409" dur="6.881">trillion approx we&amp;#39;re getting very close</text>
  <text start="122.69" dur="7.049">it&amp;#39;s like almost 16.9 or so dollars</text>
  <text start="126.29" dur="5.22">worth of debt so just think of the</text>
  <text start="129.739" dur="6.931">interest on that and if the interest</text>
  <text start="131.51" dur="8.46">picks up two or three two I&amp;#39;m een to</text>
  <text start="136.67" dur="6.12">% or four percent I mean that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="139.97" dur="7.019">be in an enormous payment and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="142.79" dur="6.809">way with the tax revenue that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.989" dur="5.791">bringing in right now we&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="149.599" dur="6.72">cover this because even though they tell</text>
  <text start="152.78" dur="6.06">us that the jobs are all coming back and</text>
  <text start="156.319" dur="4.491">everyone is making and everyone had you</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="5.64">know the unemployment is going down</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="5.53">again what type of jobs are these what</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="4.979">type of income or bring people bringing</text>
  <text start="166.34" dur="5.399">in and just because you have a temporary</text>
  <text start="169.459" dur="6.661">job does not mean you have a full-time</text>
  <text start="171.739" dur="7.111">job making the same salary producing and</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="6.119">paying the same taxes that you did</text>
  <text start="178.85" dur="6.63">before I&amp;#39;ll give you an example I know</text>
  <text start="182.239" dur="6.121">someone who had a very nice job he was</text>
  <text start="185.48" dur="7.38">making about a hundred and forty or</text>
  <text start="188.36" dur="8.18">around that area and now today can only</text>
  <text start="192.86" dur="6.659">find a job for 55,000 so this person</text>
  <text start="196.54" dur="7.39">that used to pay a lot more in taxes is</text>
  <text start="199.519" dur="7.051">no longer paying the same amount in</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="7.79">taxes and this goes with a lot of people</text>
  <text start="206.57" dur="8.55">a lot of people have a part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="211.72" dur="7.84">who are bringing a lot less money who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="215.12" dur="7.52">trimmed their lifestyle down to the bare</text>
  <text start="219.56" dur="9.03">bones of renting a small apartment</text>
  <text start="222.64" dur="10.81">having one car not going on vacations</text>
  <text start="228.59" dur="9.39">not buying things on credit and living</text>
  <text start="233.45" dur="8.21">very lean on just what they bring in not</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="7.319">spending anything just food electric</text>
  <text start="241.66" dur="5.68">rent and that&amp;#39;s it and maybe their car</text>
  <text start="245.299" dur="4.731">payments and that is it unless they owe</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="5.519">their a car but most of the people</text>
  <text start="250.03" dur="6.12">across the country are starting to live</text>
  <text start="252.859" dur="7.951">like this and the government with their</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="8.079">manipulated equations for unemployment</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="6.15">GDP and inflation does show the</text>
  <text start="264.229" dur="5.31">difference between the way it used to be</text>
  <text start="266.96" dur="3.569">and the way it is and what I did was I</text>
  <text start="269.539" dur="6.71">put it together I said</text>
  <text start="270.529" dur="8.28">just see here so if we look at the the</text>
  <text start="276.249" dur="4.06">modified calculation they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="278.809" dur="3.99">unemployment is around seven and a half</text>
  <text start="280.309" dur="4.86">percent right now but if we go back</text>
  <text start="282.799" dur="4.86">before they modify the calculation and</text>
  <text start="285.169" dur="4.83">we use the straight up calculation that</text>
  <text start="287.659" dur="5.07">they use before it&amp;#39;s at twenty-three</text>
  <text start="289.999" dur="6.8">percent the unemployment now let&amp;#39;s look</text>
  <text start="292.729" dur="6.93">at inflation their modified calculation</text>
  <text start="296.799" dur="5.98">is telling us that there&amp;#39;s only one</text>
  <text start="299.659" dur="5.91">percent inflation the unmodified</text>
  <text start="302.779" dur="8.58">calculation is showing five percent</text>
  <text start="305.569" dur="10.23">inflation GDP the modified calculation</text>
  <text start="311.359" dur="8.01">is showing two percent gdp the</text>
  <text start="315.799" dur="7.56">unmodified calculation is negative two</text>
  <text start="319.369" dur="8.13">percent so there is a very big</text>
  <text start="323.359" dur="7.38">difference when we talk about these</text>
  <text start="327.499" dur="6.06">numbers and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="330.739" dur="7.01">these numbers like the stock market</text>
  <text start="333.559" dur="7.32">numbers the unemployment GDP inflation</text>
  <text start="337.749" dur="6.79">all these things are completely</text>
  <text start="340.879" dur="11.64">meaningless because look at reality now</text>
  <text start="344.539" dur="10.23">I keep track of food and oil gas on the</text>
  <text start="352.519" dur="4.77">site inflation deflation and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="354.769" dur="5.04">tracking this and from the beginning you</text>
  <text start="357.289" dur="4.05">can see prices went up they came down a</text>
  <text start="359.809" dur="3.09">little bit they&amp;#39;re leveling off and</text>
  <text start="361.339" dur="6.78">updated again at the end of the month</text>
  <text start="362.899" dur="8.12">here and compared to what it was just a</text>
  <text start="368.119" dur="8.16">few years ago everything has gone up or</text>
  <text start="371.019" dur="8.98">they are masking the products in size</text>
  <text start="376.279" dur="7.38">giving you less but for the same amount</text>
  <text start="379.999" dur="5.64">of money and it&amp;#39;s very confusing to the</text>
  <text start="383.659" dur="5.46">public who is not looking at this</text>
  <text start="385.639" dur="6.87">because when something was a gallon and</text>
  <text start="389.119" dur="6.12">is no longer a gallon but costing the</text>
  <text start="392.509" dur="5.07">same amount and you try to manipulate</text>
  <text start="395.239" dur="5.73">the way the package looks it gives a</text>
  <text start="397.579" dur="6.301">very false representation and a false</text>
  <text start="400.969" dur="6.751">price of what something actually costs</text>
  <text start="403.88" dur="7.77">for instance ice cream Breyers for</text>
  <text start="407.72" dur="7.05">instance there is no longer you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="411.65" dur="5.55">getting a gallon or a half gallon of ice</text>
  <text start="414.77" dur="5.31">cream you&amp;#39;re getting less they made the</text>
  <text start="417.2" dur="4.32">cover bigger the price is pretty much</text>
  <text start="420.08" dur="4.11">the same where it went up a little bit</text>
  <text start="421.52" dur="4.38">and but you see this with many different</text>
  <text start="424.19" dur="3.84">products and they&amp;#39;re doing this a lot</text>
  <text start="425.9" dur="4.56">where they&amp;#39;re shrinking things or giving</text>
  <text start="428.03" dur="3.9">you less or giving you one more less of</text>
  <text start="430.46" dur="3.3">something that you would have normally</text>
  <text start="431.93" dur="4.14">got eight of and now you&amp;#39;re only getting</text>
  <text start="433.76" dur="5.73">seven and this is how they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="436.07" dur="13.65">control the inflation so you do not see</text>
  <text start="439.49" dur="12.81">it okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now now the</text>
  <text start="449.72" dur="5.76">EU extends deficit deadlines for most</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="5.46">European countries they admit that</text>
  <text start="455.48" dur="4.89">austerity is not working and they had</text>
  <text start="457.76" dur="4.98">this debacle with this Excel spreadsheet</text>
  <text start="460.37" dur="4.65">that the calculations were off but</text>
  <text start="462.74" dur="5.24">basically they&amp;#39;re extending everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="465.02" dur="6.21">deadline for like Poland to 2014</text>
  <text start="467.98" dur="7.3">slovenia the 2015 portugal to 2050</text>
  <text start="471.23" dur="6.93">netherlands 2014 spain 2016 and it goes</text>
  <text start="475.28" dur="5.67">on and basically what this means is more</text>
  <text start="478.16" dur="5.4">debt more debt more debt and this is the</text>
  <text start="480.95" dur="4.98">only way they know how to handle this by</text>
  <text start="483.56" dur="4.74">cutting things and trying to reduce your</text>
  <text start="485.93" dur="6.33">debt they realize they just can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="488.3" dur="6.87">and instead the people rather have a</text>
  <text start="492.26" dur="5.91">complete collapse then coming back on</text>
  <text start="495.17" dur="4.53">things because most think about I mean I</text>
  <text start="498.17" dur="4.2">live in America right here but think</text>
  <text start="499.7" dur="5.64">about your own country where you are and</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="6.06">the people who are not awake they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="505.34" dur="5.67">want their everyday lives to change if</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="4.62">you imagine your neighbor who doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="511.01" dur="4.44">know anything who&amp;#39;s just going along on</text>
  <text start="513.05" dur="3.96">the credit card and spending and just</text>
  <text start="515.45" dur="2.969">going on their trips and they got their</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="3.6">job they&amp;#39;re still getting the same pay</text>
  <text start="518.419" dur="5.25">all of a sudden saying you have to live</text>
  <text start="520.61" dur="5.57">on half the salary now you do not have</text>
  <text start="523.669" dur="7.111">credit because now you have bad credit</text>
  <text start="526.18" dur="7.48">people most of the population will not</text>
  <text start="530.78" dur="6.72">be able to handle that and when this</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="6.63">collapse hits and when it</text>
  <text start="537.5" dur="6.89">hits in different stages people are</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="8.64">going to have a very tough time handling</text>
  <text start="544.39" dur="7.42">this type of problem people do not like</text>
  <text start="548.93" dur="4.59">change especially the change when they</text>
  <text start="551.81" dur="4.11">have to change their lifestyle</text>
  <text start="553.52" dur="4.14">especially when they look around and</text>
  <text start="555.92" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s embarrassing when other people are</text>
  <text start="557.66" dur="4.82">looking at them going what happened to</text>
  <text start="559.43" dur="5.88">them it&amp;#39;s very difficult for people to</text>
  <text start="562.48" dur="6.27">handle this and this is when problems</text>
  <text start="565.31" dur="8.12">arise so when the collapse comes and</text>
  <text start="568.75" dur="8.02">when they do this in waves maybe only</text>
  <text start="573.43" dur="6.34">you know a quarter of the neighborhood</text>
  <text start="576.77" dur="4.89">you&amp;#39;re living in might have a huge</text>
  <text start="579.77" dur="4.26">problem and the other people might not</text>
  <text start="581.66" dur="5.25">and not see anything but those people</text>
  <text start="584.03" dur="6.18">will now be woken up because they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="586.91" dur="5.94">the problem of not having a job running</text>
  <text start="590.21" dur="6.81">out of money and having to live on a lot</text>
  <text start="592.85" dur="6.06">less compared to those who are going</text>
  <text start="597.02" dur="4.68">about their daily lives like nothing has</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="5.01">ever happened and can&amp;#39;t understand why</text>
  <text start="601.7" dur="4.26">these people have a problems and why</text>
  <text start="603.92" dur="4.29">people say just go get a job I mean I</text>
  <text start="605.96" dur="5.7">was with someone driving in the car and</text>
  <text start="608.21" dur="5.13">you know we see people on the side of</text>
  <text start="611.66" dur="4.38">the road night it just breaks my heart</text>
  <text start="613.34" dur="5.87">when I see a mother and children and a</text>
  <text start="616.04" dur="6.3">father standing out saying lost my job</text>
  <text start="619.21" dur="6.31">lost our home we have no place to go</text>
  <text start="622.34" dur="6.36">please help and I always try to please</text>
  <text start="625.52" dur="6.33">ionno Matt no matter what I always try</text>
  <text start="628.7" dur="5.46">to help because think about if you were</text>
  <text start="631.85" dur="6.27">in that position it&amp;#39;s no fault of your</text>
  <text start="634.16" dur="7.98">own it&amp;#39;s no fault I mean it&amp;#39;s the system</text>
  <text start="638.12" dur="7.68">is preventing people from getting jobs</text>
  <text start="642.14" dur="5.79">and from producing and sometimes when</text>
  <text start="645.8" dur="4.77">you&amp;#39;re in this situation you find that</text>
  <text start="647.93" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s no way out and the person I was</text>
  <text start="650.57" dur="4.98">with in the car is like look at these</text>
  <text start="652.04" dur="6.42">people go get a job but until you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="655.55" dur="5.97">that situation you don&amp;#39;t know how hard</text>
  <text start="658.46" dur="5.49">it is to find a job when you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="661.52" dur="7.35">one especially when there are very few</text>
  <text start="663.95" dur="7.4">jobs out there and I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="668.87" dur="5.21">the jobs making five six seven</text>
  <text start="671.35" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;s an hour because I hate to say it</text>
  <text start="674.08" dur="7.74">unemployment pays more than that in most</text>
  <text start="676.93" dur="7.92">states so you know that it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="681.82" dur="4.98">to keep you in a place and keep your</text>

  <text start="1409" dur="5.039">happens like the Boston event that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1412.539" dur="4.411">they wanted everyone to hand in their</text>

  <text start="1452.049" dur="5.01">phone dies down nobody can take pictures</text>
  <text start="1454.48" dur="4.26">because what they realized with the</text>
  <text start="1457.059" dur="3.87">mobile kill switch that they used in</text>
  <text start="1458.74" dur="4.65">Boston is that people were still be able</text>
  <text start="1460.929" dur="6.421">to take pictures and that was a problem</text>
  <text start="1463.39" dur="6.45">and when they turn the mobile system</text>

  <text start="1846.74" dur="6.96">chemically altered or added chemically</text>
  <text start="1849.83" dur="6.689">to create these foods and what happens</text>
  <text start="1853.7" dur="5.449">is it goes to your brain and it makes</text>
  <text start="1856.519" dur="7.321">you crave more of that type of food</text>
  <text start="1859.149" dur="6.52">secondly the chemicals in your body your</text>

  <text start="1868.279" dur="6.321">what happens is it your body starts to</text>
  <text start="1871.97" dur="7.08">store</text>
  <text start="1874.6" dur="7.18">these chemicals which turn into fat and</text>
  <text start="1879.05" dur="5.94">if you look at the children of today and</text>
  <text start="1881.78" dur="6.27">even adults who eat this type of food</text>

  <text start="1888.05" dur="6">anything that&amp;#39;s boxed just read the</text>
  <text start="1890.48" dur="6.99">label even cereals read the label most</text>
  <text start="1894.05" dur="5.43">of it is not food and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1897.47" dur="5.01">having a problem in America it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1899.48" dur="6.81">simple but everyone is addressing the</text>
  <text start="1902.48" dur="6.99">wrong problems it&amp;#39;s the food you can eat</text>
  <text start="1906.29" dur="9.269">these foods and exercise as much as you</text>
  <text start="1909.47" dur="11.22">can and you will not lose weight most of</text>
  <text start="1915.559" dur="9.391">the people today eat chemically modified</text>
  <text start="1920.69" dur="7.44">foods and their body stores it and you</text>
  <text start="1924.95" dur="7.68">get heavier and heavier and you crave it</text>
  <text start="1928.13" dur="7.2">more and more you be surprised if you</text>
  <text start="1932.63" dur="5.58">come off I&amp;#39;ll give you an example let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1935.33" dur="5.58">take bread for example I make my own</text>
  <text start="1938.21" dur="8">bread these are the ingredients in the</text>
  <text start="1940.91" dur="9.83">bread whole wheat flour I use two and</text>
  <text start="1946.21" dur="11.59">three-quarters tablespoons of butter I</text>
  <text start="1950.74" dur="10.75">use agave nectar yeast and salt and</text>
  <text start="1957.8" dur="6.24">water six ingredients I can make a loaf</text>
  <text start="1961.49" dur="5.18">of bread it&amp;#39;s all it takes and I use</text>
  <text start="1964.04" dur="6.75">organic whole wheat flour by the way and</text>
  <text start="1966.67" dur="5.98">it takes me it takes four hours to make</text>
  <text start="1970.79" dur="6.54">the bread but once you mix it up it</text>
  <text start="1972.65" dur="9.39">takes four hours for it to rise and to</text>
  <text start="1977.33" dur="7.64">bake and if you take what I just said go</text>
  <text start="1982.04" dur="5.73">to your supermarket and look at bread</text>
  <text start="1984.97" dur="4.959">let me know how many chemicals are in</text>
  <text start="1987.77" dur="4.89">that loaf of bread and you can comment</text>
  <text start="1989.929" dur="5.791">on the x 22 I know I&amp;#39;m getting off the</text>
  <text start="1992.66" dur="6.57">subject but when it comes to food we all</text>
  <text start="1995.72" dur="7.47">have to start using our brain and start</text>
  <text start="1999.23" dur="6.63">eating healthier and actually I hate to</text>
  <text start="2003.19" dur="4.349">say this you know it&amp;#39;s cheaper to make</text>
  <text start="2005.86" dur="3.659">your own stuff than it is to buy</text>
  <text start="2007.539" dur="5.161">loaf of bread I can make each loaf of</text>
  <text start="2009.519" dur="6.72">bread for about 85 cents you go there</text>
  <text start="2012.7" dur="5.789">what are you spending two three four</text>
  <text start="2016.239" dur="6.331">dollars the pen what what what loaf</text>
  <text start="2018.489" dur="8.75">you&amp;#39;re getting so it&amp;#39;s cheaper to make</text>
  <text start="2022.57" dur="4.669">your own food from scratch actually and</text>
  <text start="2027.479" dur="5.95">there&amp;#39;s another benefit to it since we</text>
  <text start="2030.94" dur="6.319">got off of all this chemically altered</text>
  <text start="2033.429" dur="8.25">food my children myself and my wife</text>
