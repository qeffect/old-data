  <text start="110.409" dur="5.581">corner because the economy is</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="7">deteriorating very very quickly and we</text>
  <text start="115.99" dur="6.659">can see right now that the United States</text>
  <text start="119.56" dur="5.72">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="122.649" dur="5.731">going to have many options left here and</text>
  <text start="125.28" dur="6.01">they&amp;#39;re going to have to do something to</text>
  <text start="128.38" dur="5.579">explain away why this economy is</text>
  <text start="131.29" dur="4.41">deteriorating so quickly especially when</text>
  <text start="133.959" dur="4.111">it crashes because you have to remember</text>
  <text start="135.7" dur="5.909">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us all along that</text>
  <text start="138.07" dur="6.509">this economy is recovered everything is</text>
  <text start="141.609" dur="8.011">fine there are no bubbles they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="144.579" dur="7.951">to be raising interest rates and anyone</text>
  <text start="149.62" dur="4.8">that doesn&amp;#39;t believe this is peddling</text>
  <text start="152.53" dur="5.03">fiction and that&amp;#39;s coming from Obama</text>
  <text start="154.42" dur="5.159">when this whole entire system comes down</text>
  <text start="157.56" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re going to they&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="159.579" dur="4.321">an explanation of why this happened</text>
  <text start="161.97" dur="2.489">because they can&amp;#39;t just say we were</text>
  <text start="163.9" dur="2.309">wrong</text>
  <text start="164.459" dur="3.551">because the neighborhood&amp;#39;s going to say</text>
  <text start="166.209" dur="4.051">well then what do we need the central</text>
  <text start="168.01" dur="5.399">bank for they didn&amp;#39;t help they made the</text>
  <text start="170.26" dur="5.25">situation worse they lied to us but we</text>
  <text start="173.409" dur="5.16">can see around the world that the</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="5.64">situation is not improving whatsoever we</text>
  <text start="178.569" dur="6.241">know that Greece has very high</text>
  <text start="181.15" dur="6.36">unemployment austerity is being pushed</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="5.28">on the people and that is so Greece can</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="4.979">get more debt and the eurozone finance</text>
  <text start="190.09" dur="4.56">ministers say Greece they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="192.489" dur="4.65">receive another 2.8 billion euros in</text>
  <text start="194.65" dur="6.539">bailout loans after deciding that Athens</text>
  <text start="197.139" dur="5.94">had progressed sufficiently with all the</text>
  <text start="201.189" dur="4.86">reforms and austerity that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="203.079" dur="5.041">they improve this situation it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="206.049" dur="7.64">mean that the people are all working now</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="9.63">what it means is they cut their exposure</text>
  <text start="213.689" dur="7.091">more people are out of work and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.75" dur="6.18">doing what the central bankers want so</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="6.239">they can put more debt on their books so</text>
  <text start="223.93" dur="5.519">they can pay the creditors and what this</text>
  <text start="227.019" dur="5.101">really means is they didn&amp;#39;t want grease</text>
  <text start="229.449" dur="5.31">to collapse because that would look bad</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="4.289">for the central bankers adding more debt</text>
  <text start="234.759" dur="3.331">to the country and then collapsing it</text>
  <text start="236.409" dur="2.76">does not look good because the rest of</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="2.579">the countries around the world are going</text>
  <text start="239.169" dur="5.13">to say whoa whoa what just happened here</text>
  <text start="240.669" dur="5.761">this is why they push for austerity this</text>
  <text start="244.299" dur="5.101">is why they want them to cut their</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="5.759">expenses so they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="5.399">take on more debt they don&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="252.189" dur="5.431">to get rid of the debt they want them to</text>
  <text start="254.799" dur="6.9">take more debt and just barely stay</text>
  <text start="257.62" dur="5.94">afloat we see right now the US</text>
  <text start="261.699" dur="5.22">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="263.56" dur="5.729">blaming Millennials for what is</text>
  <text start="266.919" dur="4.8">happening in for what is happening in</text>
  <text start="269.289" dur="6.091">the economy they&amp;#39;re saying the economy</text>
  <text start="271.719" dur="7.17">is lousy because the Millennials they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="275.38" dur="5.19">not spending their money they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="278.889" dur="4.28">buying goods they&amp;#39;re not buying</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="6.96">furniture they&amp;#39;re not buying jewelry</text>
  <text start="283.169" dur="8.081">they&amp;#39;re not buying gadgets the question</text>
  <text start="287.53" dur="5.689">is why aren&amp;#39;t they well most of the</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="4.169">Millennials they can&amp;#39;t even find a job</text>
  <text start="293.219" dur="3.271">those that are graduating from college</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="3.951">this</text>
  <text start="296.49" dur="6.26">student loan debt is very very high and</text>
  <text start="299.37" dur="5.669">they only can find part-time work and</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="5.259">you have to remember the value of the</text>
  <text start="305.039" dur="6.121">dollar has decreased so much that it</text>
  <text start="308.009" dur="7.051">really doesn&amp;#39;t go that far especially</text>
  <text start="311.16" dur="6.9">when housing prices continually moved up</text>
  <text start="315.06" dur="4.56">rents continually moved up getting a</text>
  <text start="318.06" dur="4.35">part-time job and having the student</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="6.389">loans that&amp;#39;s not going to help and the</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="6.53">Millennials right now well they have it</text>
  <text start="326.009" dur="7.351">a lot worse than many of the generations</text>
  <text start="328.94" dur="10.05">because they&amp;#39;re in the down side path of</text>
  <text start="333.36" dur="10.83">this entire fight system where it is</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="8.44">crashing now the baby boomers who came</text>
  <text start="344.19" dur="7.469">in and in 70s they came in in the</text>
  <text start="347.43" dur="8.7">beginning stages very low debt there was</text>
  <text start="351.659" dur="7.951">hyper inflation or inflation interest</text>
  <text start="356.13" dur="6.779">rates were very high and you could have</text>
  <text start="359.61" dur="5.489">purchased the house in 1969 for like</text>
  <text start="362.909" dur="4.23">twenty five thousand dollars and by 1975</text>
  <text start="365.099" dur="5.31">that same house was worth seventy-five</text>
  <text start="367.139" dur="6.09">thousand dollars but your income</text>
  <text start="370.409" dur="7.76">increased from five thousand all the way</text>
  <text start="373.229" dur="8.011">up to 25,000 in that same period today</text>
  <text start="378.169" dur="6.43">income is going wages going the opposite</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="5.16">direction housing prices are continually</text>
  <text start="384.599" dur="4.531">moving up because they created these</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="6.18">bubbles once again and if you really</text>
  <text start="389.13" dur="5.759">look these Millennials those who are</text>
  <text start="392.58" dur="4.41">graduating college there&amp;#39;s the total</text>
  <text start="394.889" dur="8.701">amount of student loan debt is around</text>
  <text start="396.99" dur="8.91">1.4 trillion dollars so they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="403.59" dur="6.329">not to blame it&amp;#39;s the circumstances that</text>
  <text start="405.9" dur="7.59">surround them they don&amp;#39;t have the same</text>
  <text start="409.919" dur="6.15">experience as the baby boomers back in</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="5.549">the 70s very different experience</text>
  <text start="416.069" dur="5.461">because at one point you have the</text>
  <text start="419.039" dur="4.891">beginning of the Fiat system now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="421.53" dur="5.1">at the end of the file system and the</text>
  <text start="423.93" dur="5.13">entire system is falling apart this is</text>
  <text start="426.63" dur="4.49">why us home ownership rate is</text>
  <text start="429.06" dur="6">at its lowest that it&amp;#39;s ever been</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="8.86">because nobody the upcoming generation</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="6.69">cannot afford homes for Millennials the</text>
  <text start="439.98" dur="4.53">home ownership rate fell to thirty four</text>
  <text start="441.75" dur="6.03">percent from around forty percent for</text>
  <text start="444.51" dur="4.92">young adults in prior decades over the</text>
  <text start="447.78" dur="4.5">past three decades the u.s. averaged</text>
  <text start="449.43" dur="5.04">nearly a hundred and twenty thousand</text>
  <text start="452.28" dur="4.35">more business bursts then deaths per</text>
  <text start="454.47" dur="5.04">year between two thousand eight and two</text>
  <text start="456.63" dur="5.099">thousand eleven on average thirty</text>
  <text start="459.51" dur="5.19">thousand more businesses died then were</text>
  <text start="461.729" dur="6.811">born and this is according to the Census</text>
  <text start="464.7" dur="7.2">Bureau the core of the US job creation</text>
  <text start="468.54" dur="6.3">machine has been faltering and is not a</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="9.75">sign of a healthy or even a recovering</text>
  <text start="474.84" dur="8.73">economy like I said we&amp;#39;re at the end</text>
  <text start="481.65" dur="6.9">game here this is what it looks like</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="7.95">when the entire system is imploding it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488.55" dur="5.85">a completely different experience coming</text>
  <text start="491.52" dur="7.62">off the gold standard in 1971 when the</text>
  <text start="494.4" dur="8.25">Fiat system was being created and all</text>
  <text start="499.14" dur="6.44">they had to do is have inflation raise</text>
  <text start="502.65" dur="7.019">interest rates and everyone felt good</text>
  <text start="505.58" dur="5.95">the opposite is happening right now we</text>
  <text start="509.669" dur="4.761">see the Federal Reserve labor market</text>
  <text start="511.53" dur="6.9">condition index while that is crashing</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="5.77">they were expecting a 1.5 rise and it</text>
  <text start="518.43" dur="4.38">plunged by two-point-two percent in</text>
  <text start="520.2" dur="5.52">September and that is from a downwardly</text>
  <text start="522.81" dur="4.77">revised August drop of negative</text>
  <text start="525.72" dur="6.15">one-point-three percent from eight point</text>
  <text start="527.58" dur="7.74">seven percent drop so we can see right</text>
  <text start="531.87" dur="10.589">now we are in the same situation that we</text>
  <text start="535.32" dur="11">were back in 2001 2008 going back even</text>
  <text start="542.459" dur="6.691">further to the other recessionary times</text>
  <text start="546.32" dur="6.7">every single time the Fed labor market</text>
  <text start="549.15" dur="6.51">condition index was declining we entered</text>
  <text start="553.02" dur="7.439">a recession / some type of depression</text>
  <text start="555.66" dur="7.31">and here we are today in the same exact</text>
  <text start="560.459" dur="6.451">position</text>
  <text start="562.97" dur="5.31">now we know the US government central</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="4.14">bankers they&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="568.28" dur="4.6">getting rid of cash that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="571.05" dur="4.95">ultimate goal they want to get rid of</text>
  <text start="572.88" dur="4.89">cash they want to control the currency</text>
  <text start="576" dur="4.44">this way you can&amp;#39;t take anything out of</text>
  <text start="577.77" dur="6.27">the bank of you are not using cash they</text>
  <text start="580.44" dur="7.29">can track all your purchases they can do</text>
  <text start="584.04" dur="6.48">bail-ins with ease and we see the US</text>
  <text start="587.73" dur="4.43">Federal Reserve well they&amp;#39;re planning to</text>
  <text start="590.52" dur="5.22">publish a paper later this year</text>
  <text start="592.16" dur="7.18">outlining its views on the startup</text>
  <text start="595.74" dur="5.82">financial innovations sweeping the</text>
  <text start="599.34" dur="6.48">banking sector and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="601.56" dur="8.61">fed governor Brainard and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="605.82" dur="6.12">the Fed recognizes blockchain and it may</text>
  <text start="610.17" dur="4.05">represent the most significant</text>
  <text start="611.94" dur="5.31">development in many years in payments</text>
  <text start="614.22" dur="5">clearing and settlement and the central</text>
  <text start="617.25" dur="7.56">banks right now he says they are working</text>
  <text start="619.22" dur="8.74">to set this up there conducting a 360</text>
  <text start="624.81" dur="7.28">degree analysis and they will move</text>
  <text start="627.96" dur="7.77">forward with this maybe by next year</text>
  <text start="632.09" dur="5.47">because right now the bank&amp;#39;s the central</text>
  <text start="635.73" dur="4.77">banks they&amp;#39;ve been testing the</text>
  <text start="637.56" dur="8.1">applications of block trade block chain</text>
  <text start="640.5" dur="10.17">for trading derivatives and it&amp;#39;s a way</text>
  <text start="645.66" dur="8.31">they can replace the existing system so</text>
  <text start="650.67" dur="5.48">here we are already they are getting</text>
  <text start="653.97" dur="5.75">prepared and ready to do away with</text>
  <text start="656.15" dur="6.16">currency everything will go digital and</text>
  <text start="659.72" dur="7.3">of course we know why they want to do</text>
  <text start="662.31" dur="7.11">this they have complete control they can</text>
  <text start="667.02" dur="5.64">track you they can shut down your</text>
  <text start="669.42" dur="5.79">purchases at any time you&amp;#39;ll never have</text>
  <text start="672.66" dur="5.76">cash on hand so you can&amp;#39;t keep anything</text>
  <text start="675.21" dur="5.79">in your home for taxes purposes they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="678.42" dur="5.91">have records of everything that you do</text>
  <text start="681" dur="6.54">and if you do not agree with the</text>
  <text start="684.33" dur="5.58">government or the powers-that-be they</text>
  <text start="687.54" dur="6.57">can shut you down with a flip of a</text>
  <text start="689.91" dur="6.36">switch and also when the entire system</text>
  <text start="694.11" dur="5.67">comes crumbling down</text>
  <text start="696.27" dur="5.58">all I have to do is go into your account</text>
  <text start="699.78" dur="3.48">and take whatever they need of course</text>
  <text start="701.85" dur="5.39">it&amp;#39;s all digital because you can&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="703.26" dur="8.69">it out so what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="707.24" dur="7.68">creating a way to have full control of</text>
  <text start="711.95" dur="7.18">the system and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="714.92" dur="8.65">these central bankers they do believe</text>
  <text start="719.13" dur="7.17">that after the economy crashes and all</text>
  <text start="723.57" dur="6.89">said and done they&amp;#39;re going to restart</text>
  <text start="726.3" dur="8.55">the system they don&amp;#39;t even question it</text>
  <text start="730.46" dur="7.15">this is their plan to explain away why</text>
  <text start="734.85" dur="4.2">the crash happened make people believe</text>
  <text start="737.61" dur="4.38">that it was another group another</text>
  <text start="739.05" dur="6.9">country this is why we had to go to war</text>
  <text start="741.99" dur="7.46">and most likely after the war depending</text>
  <text start="745.95" dur="8.13">on how many people are left they will</text>
