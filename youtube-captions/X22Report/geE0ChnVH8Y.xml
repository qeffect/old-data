  <text start="50.39" dur="3.33">anyone remembers watching the old</text>
  <text start="51.89" dur="3.419">westerns when the cowboy or the</text>
  <text start="53.72" dur="3.42">gunslinger would swagger up to the bar</text>
  <text start="55.309" dur="2.611">sling the coin across the counter and</text>
  <text start="57.14" dur="2.099">ask for another</text>
  <text start="57.92" dur="3.239">chances or that coin would have been a</text>
  <text start="59.239" dur="5.07">silver dollar they use real server coins</text>
  <text start="61.159" dur="5.011">back then between 1878 and 1921 it would</text>
  <text start="64.309" dur="3.181">have been the Morgan Silver Dollar but</text>
  <text start="66.17" dur="2.76">they went out of circulation when the</text>

  <text start="68.93" dur="3.45">rarer by the day the Morgan Silver</text>
  <text start="70.58" dur="3.33">Dollar is a great coin to start a</text>
  <text start="72.38" dur="3.39">collection off so if you want something</text>
  <text start="73.91" dur="3.54">different and unusual to buy someone for</text>
  <text start="75.77" dur="4.019">a holiday gift Morgan&amp;#39;s Silver Dollar</text>

  <text start="86.81" dur="4.43">collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="88.789" dur="5.58">understand that the plan is to</text>
  <text start="91.24" dur="5.859">transition into a new economic structure</text>
  <text start="94.369" dur="6.39">now we know that Q has already told us</text>
  <text start="97.099" dur="5.821">this when Q first came online Hugh made</text>
  <text start="100.759" dur="4.47">some posts about the Fed showed us</text>
  <text start="102.92" dur="5.49">around the world that the Rothschilds</text>
  <text start="105.229" dur="5.521">they control all these banks and they</text>
  <text start="108.41" dur="6.09">control the central bank and the Federal</text>
  <text start="110.75" dur="6.39">Reserve is immune to US laws and then</text>
  <text start="114.5" dur="3.479">later on Q came out and told us that</text>
  <text start="117.14" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s going to be an economic</text>
  <text start="117.979" dur="6">structure change that gold was going to</text>
  <text start="121.13" dur="6.81">bring down the Fed and we can see that</text>
  <text start="123.979" dur="9.331">the plan is moving forward Trump the</text>
  <text start="127.94" dur="8.73">Patriots they are using what the central</text>
  <text start="133.31" dur="7.47">bank&amp;#39;s normally do they&amp;#39;re using their</text>
  <text start="136.67" dur="7.26">strategy and then you have to think how</text>
  <text start="140.78" dur="5.34">would they prepare a nation where most</text>
  <text start="143.93" dur="3.389">of the people are sleeping where most of</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="4.53">the people don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="147.319" dur="7.981">on where something&amp;#39;s going to happen and</text>
  <text start="150.65" dur="6.8">people are going to lose maybe part of</text>
  <text start="155.3" dur="5.219">their savings maybe all their savings I</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="7.06">mean going through this transition you</text>
  <text start="160.519" dur="7.05">can&amp;#39;t protect the entire population 100</text>
  <text start="164.51" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible so what do</text>
  <text start="167.569" dur="4.92">you do to prepare for all of this how do</text>
  <text start="170.15" dur="4.94">you prepare the country for a transition</text>
  <text start="172.489" dur="7.28">can you just come out and say hey listen</text>
  <text start="175.09" dur="7.239">the economy that were in right now is</text>
  <text start="179.769" dur="5.14">completely fake phony false it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="182.329" dur="5.041">illusion the central banks they created</text>
  <text start="184.909" dur="6.42">it it&amp;#39;s their economy it will never work</text>
  <text start="187.37" dur="6.479">and we&amp;#39;re gonna get rid of it but as we</text>
  <text start="191.329" dur="6.061">get rid of it a lot of people are gonna</text>
  <text start="193.849" dur="6.151">get hurt supplies on the shelves they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="4.019">gonna disappear credits gonna freeze up</text>
  <text start="200" dur="5.099">and we&amp;#39;re gonna have major major</text>
  <text start="201.409" dur="6.42">problems well that wouldn&amp;#39;t work you</text>
  <text start="205.099" dur="4.441">would have complete panic people would</text>
  <text start="207.829" dur="3.931">just be out there going what are you</text>
  <text start="209.54" dur="3.419">talking about I&amp;#39;m gonna lose everything</text>
  <text start="211.76" dur="3.509">and people would run to the banks and</text>
  <text start="212.959" dur="3.78">try to take their funds out and they</text>
  <text start="215.269" dur="3.181">would you know take all the cash they</text>
  <text start="216.739" dur="4.56">possibly can and we know that banks</text>
  <text start="218.45" dur="5.429">don&amp;#39;t have the cash and we know that the</text>
  <text start="221.299" dur="4.681">Federal Reserve note that we all have in</text>
  <text start="223.879" dur="5.39">our wallet that eventually is going to</text>
  <text start="225.98" dur="7.5">be worthless so how do you prepare a</text>
  <text start="229.269" dur="6.271">country for something like this well</text>
  <text start="233.48" dur="5.52">there are different ways you can do it</text>
  <text start="235.54" dur="6.129">one of the ways most likely that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239" dur="5.4">doing it is everything is happening</text>
  <text start="241.669" dur="5.641">behind the scenes when we look at</text>
  <text start="244.4" dur="5.28">tariffs people look at it like oh look</text>
  <text start="247.31" dur="5.31">the trade look what&amp;#39;s happening here you</text>
  <text start="249.68" dur="3.54">know we&amp;#39;re putting penalties on other</text>
  <text start="252.62" dur="3.149">countries</text>
  <text start="253.22" dur="4.169">and things like that and we know that</text>
  <text start="255.769" dur="4.02">tariffs are being used to even the</text>
  <text start="257.389" dur="5.4">playing field between different</text>
  <text start="259.789" dur="5.431">countries with the u.s. because over</text>
  <text start="262.789" dur="4.591">many many years the deep state the</text>
  <text start="265.22" dur="4.56">central bank they&amp;#39;ve ruined our trade</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="4.95">and of course trade needs to change over</text>
  <text start="269.78" dur="3.77">going to transition so tariffs will be</text>
  <text start="272.33" dur="5.91">used for that</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="6.57">what if tariffs are being used for</text>
  <text start="278.24" dur="7.28">something else</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="10.5">what if tariffs are being used to scare</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="8.649">retailers into stocking up supplies</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="6.85">thinking they&amp;#39;re doing this because they</text>
  <text start="294.169" dur="6.301">don&amp;#39;t want to pay higher cost</text>
  <text start="297.47" dur="8.25">the line think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="7.68">you can force retailers into packing</text>
  <text start="305.72" dur="4.65">their warehouses and we&amp;#39;ll be getting</text>
  <text start="308.15" dur="4.92">into that in just a minute but before we</text>
  <text start="310.37" dur="6.06">do I want to talk about the economy</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="4.74">right now now everything is falling</text>
  <text start="316.43" dur="3.99">apart and it&amp;#39;s going to accelerate</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="5.82">things are going to change dramatically</text>
  <text start="320.42" dur="4.98">in 2019 think about what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="323.63" dur="4.8">out in the Middle East this is based on</text>
  <text start="325.4" dur="6.15">a petro dollar system as he pulls the</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="5.04">troops out of the Middle East things are</text>
  <text start="331.55" dur="3.36">just gonna start to change because once</text>
  <text start="333.47" dur="3.9">the people take control of their country</text>
  <text start="334.91" dur="4.17">just like Assad now has control over his</text>
  <text start="337.37" dur="5.22">country they&amp;#39;re not going to be using</text>
  <text start="339.08" dur="6.81">the dollar in their reserves most likely</text>
  <text start="342.59" dur="7.23">they will not be selling oil using the</text>
  <text start="345.89" dur="7.71">Federal Reserve note the US dollar so</text>
  <text start="349.82" dur="7.17">this was set up back in the 70s by the</text>
  <text start="353.6" dur="6.96">deeps a by the central banks and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356.99" dur="6.679">being dismantled right now so when all</text>
  <text start="360.56" dur="7.109">the troops start to come home countries</text>
  <text start="363.669" dur="5.801">they are going to run their system the</text>
  <text start="367.669" dur="2.671">way they want it to be run and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="369.47" dur="3.84">talking about the countries in the</text>
  <text start="370.34" dur="5.85">Middle East you&amp;#39;re going to see things</text>
  <text start="373.31" dur="4.74">change very very quickly Trump the</text>
  <text start="376.19" dur="3.81">Patriots know this they know that</text>
  <text start="378.05" dur="3.21">everything is going to accelerate the</text>
  <text start="380" dur="3.21">people&amp;#39;s economy and I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="381.26" dur="4.35">about their statistical numbers I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="4.23">talking about the real economy things</text>
  <text start="385.61" dur="2.46">are gonna start to fall apart very very</text>
  <text start="387.44" dur="2.97">rapidly</text>
  <text start="388.07" dur="5.49">most likely in 2019 as the Fed</text>
  <text start="390.41" dur="6.36">continually raised rates and we can see</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="6.12">it already if we look at income spending</text>
  <text start="396.77" dur="5.82">savings they have plunged to the lowest</text>
  <text start="399.68" dur="4.95">since 2013 and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this</text>
  <text start="402.59" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re in the beginning phase when you</text>
  <text start="404.63" dur="5.13">come on to this Fiat system you know you</text>
  <text start="407.87" dur="3.98">see inflation you see high interest</text>
  <text start="409.76" dur="4.409">rates because you&amp;#39;re coming off a</text>
  <text start="411.85" dur="4.72">standard of gold and you&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="414.169" dur="4.351">towards hey let&amp;#39;s just create currency</text>
  <text start="416.57" dur="4.29">willy-nilly it makes no difference in</text>
  <text start="418.52" dur="5.19">that devalue is the dollar interest</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="3.99">rates are raised inflation and everyone</text>
  <text start="423.71" dur="3.209">thinks that things are getting better</text>
  <text start="424.85" dur="4.86">because you need more dollars to pay for</text>
  <text start="426.919" dur="4.291">the same exact thing at the end of the</text>
  <text start="429.71" dur="5.4">system which we&amp;#39;re in right now</text>
  <text start="431.21" dur="6.51">everything changes they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="435.11" dur="6">created all the currency they&amp;#39;ve put us</text>
  <text start="437.72" dur="5.12">into debt they put us into global debt</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="6.839">like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="442.84" dur="8.41">wages are not going to be moving up the</text>
  <text start="447.949" dur="5.25">debt level is too high for the people to</text>
  <text start="451.25" dur="3.78">sustain it&amp;#39;s too high for the government</text>
  <text start="453.199" dur="4.351">to sustain it&amp;#39;s too high for the world</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="4.71">to sustain and this is where everything</text>
  <text start="457.55" dur="4.14">starts to break down and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="459.74" dur="4.92">what we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="461.69" dur="5.28">retail and everything else start to</text>
  <text start="464.66" dur="4.979">decline even quicker than it is right</text>
  <text start="466.97" dur="4.199">now we are going to get a little bump up</text>
  <text start="469.639" dur="3.631">because of what is happening with the</text>
  <text start="471.169" dur="4.891">FICO scores people are gonna use a lot</text>
  <text start="473.27" dur="4.47">of credit during this holiday season but</text>
  <text start="476.06" dur="5.22">after this we&amp;#39;re gonna see things</text>
  <text start="477.74" dur="5.19">decline very very rapidly we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="481.28" dur="3.78">at durable goods and we can see and this</text>
  <text start="482.93" dur="5.239">is washers dryers and bigger ticket</text>
  <text start="485.06" dur="5.76">items we see that they are declining and</text>
  <text start="488.169" dur="5.081">they thought and they expected they were</text>
  <text start="490.82" dur="5.67">going to be you know moving up but they</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="6.09">aren&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;ve dropped and this is going</text>
  <text start="496.49" dur="6.45">to be a problem moving forward we also</text>
  <text start="499.34" dur="5.85">see GDP is being revised remember these</text>
  <text start="502.94" dur="5.67">numbers GDP when you look at</text>
  <text start="505.19" dur="5.789">unemployment all they do is manipulate</text>
  <text start="508.61" dur="6.119">the numbers to make you think that</text>
  <text start="510.979" dur="6.331">things are ok here and Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="514.729" dur="4.711">this on purpose to make the mainstream</text>
  <text start="517.31" dur="5.43">media to make the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="519.44" dur="5.39">bank to make them not point the finger</text>
  <text start="522.74" dur="6.289">at Trump that&amp;#39;s the whole point of this</text>
  <text start="524.83" dur="7.21">while they work in the background now</text>
  <text start="529.029" dur="6.101">retailers they&amp;#39;re very nervous about</text>
  <text start="532.04" dur="5.52">higher tariffs in 2019 so companies</text>
  <text start="535.13" dur="5.94">around the country are stockpiling goods</text>
  <text start="537.56" dur="4.98">their warehouses are stuffed to capacity</text>
  <text start="541.07" dur="3.57">now do you think the American people are</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="5.91">just gonna go out and buy all that stuff</text>
  <text start="544.64" dur="6.99">no like I said in the beginning how do</text>
  <text start="548.45" dur="7.32">you prepare a nation and how do you make</text>
  <text start="551.63" dur="8.36">all these retailers stuff their</text>
  <text start="555.77" dur="6.77">warehouses to the brim with goods</text>
  <text start="559.99" dur="6.3">food supplies anything that you would</text>
  <text start="562.54" dur="6.78">need well you scare them with tariffs</text>
  <text start="566.29" dur="5.22">and dozens of companies include</text>
  <text start="569.32" dur="5.28">retailers vendors customer broker supply</text>
  <text start="571.51" dur="6.09">chain experts they&amp;#39;re all doing it</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="3.87">they are binge buying right now like</text>
  <text start="577.6" dur="3.03">there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow</text>
  <text start="578.47" dur="5.58">and the Christmas season this holiday</text>
  <text start="580.63" dur="6.66">season is almost over so why are they</text>
  <text start="584.05" dur="4.86">doing this they&amp;#39;re doing it to get</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="4.799">prepared they might not know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="588.91" dur="6.39">doing this but I believe this is a plan</text>
  <text start="592.089" dur="6.511">that was put into place and they were</text>
  <text start="595.3" dur="5.61">hoping by saying lik look things are</text>
  <text start="598.6" dur="5.609">gonna be a lot more expensive go out and</text>
  <text start="600.91" dur="5.46">purchase it now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="604.209" dur="6.241">second we&amp;#39;ve been saying this for a very</text>
  <text start="606.37" dur="5.64">long time when inflation hits and that</text>
  <text start="610.45" dur="3.09">means all the reserve dollars come back</text>
  <text start="612.01" dur="3.48">to the United States that means there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.54" dur="4.77">a lot of dollars floating around in the</text>
  <text start="615.49" dur="5.28">economy which means that the prices of</text>
  <text start="618.31" dur="4.02">items it&amp;#39;s going to go up actually what</text>
  <text start="620.77" dur="3.66">it really means is that it takes more</text>
  <text start="622.33" dur="5.49">dollars to buy the same exact thing so</text>
  <text start="624.43" dur="5.55">that loaf of bread that might not be</text>
  <text start="627.82" dur="6.24">three four or five dollars it might be</text>
  <text start="629.98" dur="7.62">fifteen eighteen twenty five dollars the</text>
  <text start="634.06" dur="5.279">retailer&amp;#39;s the customs brokers the</text>
  <text start="637.6" dur="4.17">supply chain experts and all these</text>
  <text start="639.339" dur="5.821">individuals that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="641.77" dur="5.879">about with tariffs that things are going</text>
  <text start="645.16" dur="5.81">to increase in price so they&amp;#39;re buying</text>
  <text start="647.649" dur="5.551">them now to make sure they have them now</text>
  <text start="650.97" dur="4.84">now of course we know that Trump is</text>
  <text start="653.2" dur="4.68">working out a deal with China and he</text>
  <text start="655.81" dur="4.41">says they&amp;#39;re very very close and most</text>
  <text start="657.88" dur="5.67">likely we&amp;#39;re going to see a deal now</text>
  <text start="660.22" dur="9.27">remember the Trump doctrine is economic</text>
