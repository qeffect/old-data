  <text start="273.94" dur="5.58">seeing the same thing happen in the UK</text>
  <text start="276.52" dur="4.649">we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Germany we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="5.82">it throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="281.169" dur="7.261">in China and yes the US sales of new</text>
  <text start="285.34" dur="5.4">passenger vehicles they are measured by</text>

  <text start="298.439" dur="6.25">sales in the full year of 2018 drop 6.8</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="5.49">percent reflecting 12 months of</text>

  <text start="316.779" dur="4.14">the UK now of course people said well it</text>
  <text start="318.819" dur="4.201">has to be the brexit that&amp;#39;s what it is</text>
  <text start="320.919" dur="4.981">you see once you start to vote yourself</text>
  <text start="323.02" dur="6.899">away this is what happens well not so</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="8.37">fast we&amp;#39;re seeing this in other areas</text>
  <text start="329.919" dur="6.24">outside of the UK in China throughout</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="5.009">other European markets and especially</text>
  <text start="336.159" dur="7.021">Germany we&amp;#39;re also seeing registrations</text>
  <text start="339.279" dur="6.63">they have dropped what does that tell</text>
  <text start="343.18" dur="7.169">you has nothing to do with the brexit it</text>
  <text start="345.909" dur="7.711">tells you that people are not purchasing</text>
  <text start="350.349" dur="5.91">new vehicles why not because when people</text>
  <text start="353.62" dur="4.949">do not have high paying jobs when</text>
  <text start="356.259" dur="4.59">unemployment is rising in many of these</text>
  <text start="358.569" dur="6.87">countries when debt levels get to a</text>
  <text start="360.849" dur="6.68">certain area people pull back and this</text>
  <text start="365.439" dur="4.741">is exactly what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="367.529" dur="7.42">remember the central bank system their</text>
  <text start="370.18" dur="6.18">global system is deteriorating imploding</text>
  <text start="374.949" dur="4.59">on itself actually if you look at</text>
  <text start="376.36" dur="7.16">Germany their German industrial activity</text>
  <text start="379.539" dur="6.69">plunged the most since 2009 it declined</text>
  <text start="383.52" dur="6.819">how could this be I thought everything</text>
  <text start="386.229" dur="5.101">was great throughout Europe the ECB they</text>
  <text start="390.339" dur="3.63">said they were going to start to raise</text>
  <text start="391.33" dur="5.179">rates but industrial production fell for</text>
  <text start="393.969" dur="5.43">a third month in November</text>
  <text start="396.509" dur="5.56">something is happening this is what it</text>
  <text start="399.399" dur="5.94">looks like when a central bank system</text>
  <text start="402.069" dur="6.241">falls apart now we&amp;#39;re watching the</text>
  <text start="405.339" dur="4.741">Central Bank global system fall apart if</text>
  <text start="408.31" dur="3.87">you look at the United States we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.08" dur="3.299">having the same exact problems the only</text>
  <text start="412.18" dur="2.5">difference with the United States is</text>
  <text start="413.379" dur="5.801">that the central</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="9.12">Bank is embedded within the United</text>
  <text start="419.18" dur="6.39">States and in the past the deep state</text>
  <text start="423.8" dur="4.41">the central bank</text>
  <text start="425.57" dur="4.8">they were one in the same and they were</text>
  <text start="428.21" dur="5.07">able to manipulate everything together</text>
  <text start="430.37" dur="6.06">now things are changing Trump has the</text>
  <text start="433.28" dur="5.79">magic wand Trump has the ability to</text>
  <text start="436.43" dur="5.519">manipulate he&amp;#39;s using their tools he</text>
  <text start="439.07" dur="6.99">also which I do believe has control over</text>
  <text start="441.949" dur="7.081">the central bank and he&amp;#39;s dictating to</text>
  <text start="446.06" dur="5.37">the central bank what he wants done even</text>
  <text start="449.03" dur="4.259">though he&amp;#39;s telling the world I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="451.43" dur="5.82">believe this is happening this is on</text>
  <text start="453.289" dur="6.651">purpose to blame the Fed now if we look</text>
  <text start="457.25" dur="6.419">at job openings in the United States</text>
  <text start="459.94" dur="6.25">something has just changed according to</text>
  <text start="463.669" dur="6.12">the BLS after an upward revision in</text>
  <text start="466.19" dur="6.24">October job openings from 7 million to</text>
  <text start="469.789" dur="6.571">7.1 million in November this number</text>
  <text start="472.43" dur="6.03">tumbled by 243 thousand to 6.6 million</text>
  <text start="476.36" dur="5.309">this is the lowest number since last</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="5.4">June and there&amp;#39;s a graph that we always</text>
  <text start="481.669" dur="5.131">look at where we look at job hires verse</text>
  <text start="483.86" dur="7.86">12-month accumulative change in payrolls</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="7.89">and if we go back to 2006 2007 we saw</text>
  <text start="491.72" dur="4.979">the job hires start to decline and we</text>
  <text start="494.69" dur="4.699">saw the 12-month cumulative change in</text>
  <text start="496.699" dur="7.44">payrolls also start to clump to decline</text>
  <text start="499.389" dur="6.611">this time the job hires mom they started</text>
  <text start="504.139" dur="3.631">to decline they inched up a little bit</text>
  <text start="506" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re starting to decline once again</text>
  <text start="507.77" dur="4.319">and the 12-month cumulative change in</text>
  <text start="509.87" dur="4.65">payrolls they are starting to decline</text>
  <text start="512.089" dur="5.551">and you can see there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="514.52" dur="5.37">separation compared to the amount of job</text>
  <text start="517.64" dur="5.1">hires and to the amount of 12-month</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="6.87">cumulative change in payrolls we are</text>
  <text start="522.74" dur="8.7">entering a recession the manipulation is</text>
  <text start="526.76" dur="7.38">coming to an end and Trump right now is</text>
  <text start="531.44" dur="4.35">doing everything he possibly can using</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="4.68">the tools of the central bank that each</text>
  <text start="535.79" dur="7.77">state to keep the economy looking like</text>
  <text start="538.82" dur="8.67">it is doing absolutely fantastically he</text>
  <text start="543.56" dur="5.3">already knows that this economy is one</text>
  <text start="547.49" dur="4.68">gigantic illusion</text>
  <text start="548.86" dur="4.66">he already said he has the magic one he</text>

  <text start="553.52" dur="3.93">market up he already knows that he can</text>
  <text start="555.65" dur="5.28">manipulate the data to make it look</text>
  <text start="557.45" dur="6.27">fantastic he already knows because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.93" dur="4.98">already baked in the plan he already</text>
  <text start="563.72" dur="5.58">knows how they&amp;#39;re going to bring down</text>
  <text start="565.91" dur="6.83">the central bank system the only thing</text>
  <text start="569.3" dur="6.66">that they need to do right now is drop</text>
  <text start="572.74" dur="6.64">breadcrumbs to let the rest of the</text>
  <text start="575.96" dur="6.57">country the world know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="579.38" dur="7.53">about to do they need to educate them in</text>
  <text start="582.53" dur="6.75">every step of the way they also need to</text>
  <text start="586.91" dur="5.43">get rid of certain players in certain</text>

  <text start="598.7" dur="5.43">Fed is doing what Trump wants them to do</text>
  <text start="601.55" dur="3.77">and Trump tweeted out something very</text>
  <text start="604.13" dur="5.19">very interesting today</text>
  <text start="605.32" dur="4.54">he said economic numbers looking really</text>
  <text start="609.32" dur="3.27">good</text>
  <text start="609.86" dur="5.4">now really is in all caps can you</text>
