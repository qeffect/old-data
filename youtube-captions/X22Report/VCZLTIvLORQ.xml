  <text start="65.36" dur="7.35">is the globalist economic structure is</text>
  <text start="68.659" dur="7.201">slowly being dismantled let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="72.71" dur="5.1">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="75.86" dur="3.869">we need to keep in mind something very</text>
  <text start="77.81" dur="3.87">important I mean we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="79.729" dur="5.691">the economic indicators we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="81.68" dur="5.43">looking at GDP housing unemployment and</text>
  <text start="85.42" dur="3.67">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the</text>
  <text start="87.11" dur="3.929">statistical numbers that the government</text>
  <text start="89.09" dur="3.24">puts out the central bank puts out we</text>
  <text start="91.039" dur="4.021">hear what the corporate media saying</text>
  <text start="92.33" dur="5.12">would see the stock market rising and we</text>
  <text start="95.06" dur="7.14">need to remember that the central banks</text>
  <text start="97.45" dur="7.27">they are absolute pros that making it</text>
  <text start="102.2" dur="6.479">look like the economy is doing well when</text>
  <text start="104.72" dur="5.55">it really isn&amp;#39;t this is their trick</text>
  <text start="108.679" dur="5.161">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been using for</text>
  <text start="110.27" dur="5.279">thousands of years and yes the bank has</text>
  <text start="113.84" dur="3.84">been around for thousands of years not</text>
  <text start="115.549" dur="5.341">here in the United States but around the</text>
  <text start="117.68" dur="4.95">world and they&amp;#39;ve come and gone and here</text>
  <text start="120.89" dur="5.159">we are once again they&amp;#39;re bigger than</text>
  <text start="122.63" dur="6.09">ever and they know and they have the</text>
  <text start="126.049" dur="4.35">ability to convince everyone that the</text>
  <text start="128.72" dur="3.989">economy is doing well and when it</text>
  <text start="130.399" dur="5.041">crashes they have the ability to say it</text>
  <text start="132.709" dur="4.351">was in our fault it was the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="135.44" dur="3.84">fault it was the people&amp;#39;s fault it was</text>
  <text start="137.06" dur="5.34">everyone else&amp;#39;s fault except theirs and</text>
  <text start="139.28" dur="5.31">this is done on purpose but one thing we</text>
  <text start="142.4" dur="6.149">need to remember is that the everyday</text>
  <text start="144.59" dur="6.69">person when they lose their job when</text>
  <text start="148.549" dur="5.791">they&amp;#39;re not making money or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="151.28" dur="6.12">making a lot less money and they have a</text>
  <text start="154.34" dur="7.17">lot of debt and when you retire your</text>
  <text start="157.4" dur="6.99">money is not there you realize how bad</text>
  <text start="161.51" dur="6.08">the situation is now even if you do</text>
  <text start="164.39" dur="7.29">retire and you&amp;#39;re receiving your pension</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="7.2">that pretty much stays static while you</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="6.809">see inflation gas prices move up</text>
  <text start="174.79" dur="6.52">electricity increases food prices go up</text>
  <text start="178.489" dur="5.011">and the money that they told you you are</text>
  <text start="181.31" dur="4.08">going to need for retirement but which</text>
  <text start="183.5" dur="3.84">would be more than enough is never</text>
  <text start="185.39" dur="4.26">enough this is why we see a lot</text>
  <text start="187.34" dur="4.8">the older generation getting part-time</text>
  <text start="189.65" dur="5.55">jobs right now and the situation is just</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="8.28">getting worse because we are at the end</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="9.39">of the entire fiat cycle it only lasts</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="9.09">for about 45 maybe 50 years at the most</text>
  <text start="204.59" dur="7.32">and once it&amp;#39;s all said and done you</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="4.47">can&amp;#39;t go any further and here we are</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="4.77">today now we see that 65 percent of</text>
  <text start="213.98" dur="5.31">Americans they save little or nothing</text>
  <text start="216.68" dur="7.05">half of them they struggle through</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="7.38">retirement and what we&amp;#39;re seeing today</text>
  <text start="223.73" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s not just the older generation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.67" dur="4.679">the younger generation that has gone</text>
  <text start="229.04" dur="4.86">through college put themselves into debt</text>
  <text start="231.349" dur="4.711">and they can&amp;#39;t find those high-paying</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="4.559">jobs that they were promised yes there</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="3.989">was a certain period of time where</text>
  <text start="238.459" dur="5.131">people could come out of college and</text>
  <text start="240.049" dur="6.181">find that job this was in the beginning</text>
  <text start="243.59" dur="6.42">stages - the middle stage of their FEA</text>
  <text start="246.23" dur="6.629">system but when we&amp;#39;re at the end of the</text>
  <text start="250.01" dur="4.379">system it just doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore and</text>
  <text start="252.859" dur="2.401">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="254.389" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="255.26" dur="5.55">indicators showing us that the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.959" dur="4.77">economy what you can feel and touch it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="5.13">really starting to decline very very</text>
  <text start="262.729" dur="5.701">rapidly housing starts permits there</text>
  <text start="265.94" dur="5.19">plunging rental units they&amp;#39;re crashing</text>
  <text start="268.43" dur="4.98">and we could see the housing data came</text>
  <text start="271.13" dur="4.8">out and the housing sales data is</text>
  <text start="273.41" dur="4.4">completely dismal we see that permits</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="5.04">have plunged in February and</text>
  <text start="277.81" dur="5.109">multi-family unit data well that has</text>
  <text start="280.97" dur="6.629">declined very very rapidly we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="282.919" dur="5.941">a 7% plunge in housing starts now they</text>
  <text start="287.599" dur="3.451">thought it was only going to be negative</text>
  <text start="288.86" dur="4.89">two point seven percent but it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="291.05" dur="5.7">much lower than that we see a 5.7</text>
  <text start="293.75" dur="6.33">percent tumble in permits this is the</text>
  <text start="296.75" dur="5.07">biggest since February of 2017 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="4.32">starting to look like the housing bubble</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="4.8">has popped and if we look at housing</text>
  <text start="304.4" dur="4.28">starts urine year and we look at the</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="5.13">graph we can see the trajectory is</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="8.62">downward and if we go back in time we</text>
  <text start="311.75" dur="7.53">can see from 2008 to 2011 it was pumped</text>
  <text start="317.3" dur="3.989">up once again then it dropped and they</text>
  <text start="319.28" dur="4.349">pumped it up very very slowly</text>
  <text start="321.289" dur="5.791">now we&amp;#39;re declining declining declining</text>
  <text start="323.629" dur="5.731">declining ever since 2012 and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="327.08" dur="7.199">do anything about it and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="329.36" dur="9.119">to the point where we&amp;#39;re at 0% that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="334.279" dur="6.961">where we were back in 2006 and here we</text>
  <text start="338.479" dur="5.36">are once again which means that this is</text>
  <text start="341.24" dur="5.909">another indicator letting us know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.839" dur="5.98">you know we&amp;#39;re on the path of everything</text>
  <text start="347.149" dur="6.75">starting to fall apart we talked about</text>
  <text start="349.819" dur="6.57">retail quite a bit how these retail</text>
  <text start="353.899" dur="3.54">stores these huge chains how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="356.389" dur="3.09">going bankrupt</text>
  <text start="357.439" dur="4.861">well Moody&amp;#39;s is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.479" dur="5.601">saying well it looks like there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="5.429">more bankruptcies they are coming and</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="5.799">they&amp;#39;re saying that we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="367.729" dur="5.22">lot of these retailers go belly-up and</text>
  <text start="370.879" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re already starting to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="372.949" dur="4.76">them and it happened in in 2017 and 2018</text>
  <text start="376.369" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s just gonna get worse</text>
  <text start="377.709" dur="7.27">so what Moody&amp;#39;s is saying and what their</text>
  <text start="381.979" dur="5.94">research report is saying is that there</text>
  <text start="384.979" dur="4.98">are forecasting at least six retail and</text>
  <text start="387.919" dur="4.35">apparel issuers to folding over the next</text>
  <text start="389.959" dur="4.591">12 months with most of these occurring</text>
  <text start="392.269" dur="4.98">in the first half of the year the</text>
  <text start="394.55" dur="4.619">problem is that if that it only gets</text>
  <text start="397.249" dur="4.831">worse from there and the rating agency</text>
  <text start="399.169" dur="5.661">expects upcoming maturities for</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="5.309">distressed issuers will spike in 2019</text>
  <text start="404.83" dur="3.939">defaults are growing as many struggle</text>
  <text start="407.389" dur="3.541">with high leverage and challenge</text>
  <text start="408.769" dur="3.781">operating performance these challenges</text>
  <text start="410.93" dur="4.739">are compounded by the biggest risk</text>
  <text start="412.55" dur="5.339">mounting maturities which spike in 2019</text>
  <text start="415.669" dur="5.31">now a lot of these retailers have debt</text>
  <text start="417.889" dur="6.3">coming due they have these maturities</text>
  <text start="420.979" dur="5.58">that are coming to and in 2019 and we</text>
  <text start="424.189" dur="4.921">see a lot of stores Sears while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="426.559" dur="6.681">in a huge amount of trouble Neiman</text>
  <text start="429.11" dur="8.099">Marcus clears bi-lo Guitar Center</text>
  <text start="433.24" dur="7.449">99-cent stores Nine West evergreen and</text>
  <text start="437.209" dur="5.371">it just goes on and on and on and the</text>
  <text start="440.689" dur="4.44">situation is just going to get worse and</text>
  <text start="442.58" dur="5.28">worse it&amp;#39;s not going to improve I mean</text>
  <text start="445.129" dur="4.53">look at Toys R Us today I mean something</text>
  <text start="447.86" dur="2.82">that&amp;#39;s been around for what 70 years</text>
  <text start="449.659" dur="3.931">come</text>
  <text start="450.68" dur="5.12">lately gone same thing with RadioShack</text>
  <text start="453.59" dur="5.699">we&amp;#39;re gonna see it happen what Sears</text>
  <text start="455.8" dur="7.57">most of these stores will not exist</text>
  <text start="459.289" dur="7.561">anymore everything is completely falling</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="6.12">apart and it has to fall apart don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="466.85" dur="4.56">me wrong because this system that were</text>
  <text start="469.49" dur="5.01">in this is a globalist central bank</text>
  <text start="471.41" dur="6.539">system they&amp;#39;ve developed it they created</text>
  <text start="474.5" dur="6.21">it they molded it and they made everyone</text>
  <text start="477.949" dur="6.03">believe that everything was fine I mean</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="5.28">go back to the late 70s the 80s the 90s</text>
  <text start="483.979" dur="3.391">there were people on there saying that</text>
  <text start="485.99" dur="4.53">the middle class was going to disappear</text>
  <text start="487.37" dur="4.769">we&amp;#39;re adding too much debt this as we</text>
  <text start="490.52" dur="3.63">move forward won&amp;#39;t be able to be</text>
  <text start="492.139" dur="4.021">sustained and things are gonna start to</text>
  <text start="494.15" dur="5.85">break down well we saw the breakdown in</text>
  <text start="496.16" dur="6.12">2008 but the central banks they have the</text>
  <text start="500" dur="5.34">ability and they know how to manipulate</text>
  <text start="502.28" dur="6.419">the system so they can keep it running</text>
  <text start="505.34" dur="5.25">and they can&amp;#39;t do it forever and they</text>
  <text start="508.699" dur="4.621">know this this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="510.59" dur="4.8">preparing since that time to make sure</text>
  <text start="513.32" dur="4.019">that they can move their system to</text>
  <text start="515.39" dur="5.85">another location they weren&amp;#39;t quite</text>
  <text start="517.339" dur="6.541">finished in 2008 they had more to do and</text>
  <text start="521.24" dur="5.01">we can see right now it looks like</text>
  <text start="523.88" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re pretty much ready to go now at</text>
  <text start="526.25" dur="3.99">the same time</text>
  <text start="527.51" dur="4.74">Trump is dismantling everything that</text>
  <text start="530.24" dur="4.02">they put in place now it&amp;#39;d be great if</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="4.47">he can just you know say I want</text>
  <text start="534.26" dur="4.17">everything gone all at once but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.72" dur="4.5">quite impossible they&amp;#39;ve been doing this</text>
  <text start="538.43" dur="4.2">since 1913 and if you don&amp;#39;t even want to</text>
  <text start="541.22" dur="3.39">go back that far let&amp;#39;s say they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="542.63" dur="4.68">doing this since 1971 when we went on</text>
  <text start="544.61" dur="5.58">the petro dollar system that&amp;#39;s about 47</text>
  <text start="547.31" dur="5.13">years ago and to dismantle everything</text>
  <text start="550.19" dur="4.86">that they&amp;#39;ve done in 40 you know in</text>
  <text start="552.44" dur="5.58">those 47 years to do it within one year</text>
  <text start="555.05" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s pretty darn impossible you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="558.02" dur="5.61">need a lot more time but you can see</text>
  <text start="560.3" dur="5.13">right now that the TPP the NAFTA all the</text>
  <text start="563.63" dur="4.59">bilateral trades that are going to be</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="5.219">worked out here the tariffs are being</text>

  <text start="573.23" dur="4.919">were put into place to keep the central</text>
  <text start="574.94" dur="4.889">banking system operational and once you</text>
  <text start="578.149" dur="3.841">start removing all these things</text>
  <text start="579.829" dur="4.19">the central bank starts to break down</text>
  <text start="581.99" dur="3.829">this is the main mission of</text>
  <text start="584.019" dur="4.831">all this now countries are starting to</text>
  <text start="585.819" dur="5.161">realize that the dollar will no longer</text>
  <text start="588.85" dur="3.75">exist and a lot of people think that the</text>
  <text start="590.98" dur="4.259">petrol yuyuan is going to take years and</text>
  <text start="592.6" dur="5.849">years and years to you know get up to</text>
  <text start="595.239" dur="5.551">speed and allow it to become maybe a</text>
  <text start="598.449" dur="4.531">reserve currency or maybe part of a</text>
  <text start="600.79" dur="3.81">reserve currency but it really isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="602.98" dur="4.74">going to take that much time it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="604.6" dur="4.709">simple all they have to do is make the</text>
  <text start="607.72" dur="3.479">announcement I mean really think about</text>
  <text start="609.309" dur="3.93">it they made the announcement when we</text>
  <text start="611.199" dur="4.5">came off the gold standard in 1971 in</text>
  <text start="613.239" dur="4.71">World War two they decided okay after</text>
  <text start="615.699" dur="5.07">the war let&amp;#39;s start a whole new system</text>
  <text start="617.949" dur="4.74">and this is really what they wanted to</text>
  <text start="620.769" dur="4.92">do this time they wanted to have</text>
  <text start="622.689" dur="4.471">something like a great war and after it</text>
  <text start="625.689" dur="3.15">was all said and done saying okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="627.16" dur="4.38">move to the new system but now we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="628.839" dur="5.94">have that right now that has been</text>
  <text start="631.54" dur="7.19">stopped up to this point but countries</text>
  <text start="634.779" dur="8.25">realize that the dollar cannot go on and</text>
  <text start="638.73" dur="6.88">we can see that china is liquidating</text>
  <text start="643.029" dur="4.74">Treasuries according to the latest just</text>

  <text start="850.09" dur="2.55">don&amp;#39;t really have</text>
  <text start="850.87" dur="3.63">that much manufacturing anymore even</text>
  <text start="852.64" dur="3.51">though it&amp;#39;s being you know he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="854.5" dur="3.51">to bring it back but you just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="856.15" dur="3.9">bring everything back because it took</text>
  <text start="858.01" dur="4.35">years and years and years to send it off</text>
  <text start="860.05" dur="4.32">to other countries you just can&amp;#39;t bring</text>
  <text start="862.36" dur="3.66">it back in months or two months or three</text>
  <text start="864.37" dur="4.08">months or four months it&amp;#39;s gonna take</text>
  <text start="866.02" dur="5.52">years because you have to undo</text>
  <text start="868.45" dur="5.19">everything that they did so here we are</text>
  <text start="871.54" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re in the process we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="873.64" dur="6.3">dismantling phase to trigger the central</text>
  <text start="876.88" dur="6.149">bank into doing something to bring the</text>
  <text start="879.94" dur="7.02">central bank down to shift the narrative</text>
  <text start="883.029" dur="5.431">to take back control that&amp;#39;s what this is</text>
  <text start="886.96" dur="3.69">all about now we&amp;#39;re gonna go through a</text>
  <text start="888.46" dur="3.68">transition Russia went through I mean</text>
  <text start="890.65" dur="4.439">Soviet Union went through the transition</text>
  <text start="892.14" dur="5.35">we went through a transition in 1971 we</text>
  <text start="895.089" dur="5.341">went through a transition during after a</text>
  <text start="897.49" dur="5.099">World War two we&amp;#39;re gonna go through a</text>
  <text start="900.43" dur="6.14">transition but this time the reserve</text>
  <text start="902.589" dur="8.071">currency is leaving the United States</text>
  <text start="906.57" dur="7.12">it&amp;#39;s going someplace else and this is</text>
  <text start="910.66" dur="6.21">going to be a shock to the people here</text>
  <text start="913.69" dur="6.71">in this country because before Bretton</text>
  <text start="916.87" dur="7.37">Woods we became the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="920.4" dur="6.61">everything was good we had manufacturing</text>
  <text start="924.24" dur="3.969">1971 we came off the gold standard and</text>
  <text start="927.01" dur="5.79">went to a petro dollar Center but we</text>
  <text start="928.209" dur="8.25">stayed as the reserve currency now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="932.8" dur="6.11">at the end of the petrodollar system we</text>
  <text start="936.459" dur="5.401">will no longer be the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="938.91" dur="5.11">this has been slated for another country</text>
  <text start="941.86" dur="3.99">where they have manufacturing think</text>
  <text start="944.02" dur="3.54">about when we became the reserve country</text>
  <text start="945.85" dur="5.19">I&amp;#39;m talking about the United States we</text>
  <text start="947.56" dur="8.36">have manufacturing the country was</text>
  <text start="951.04" dur="8.37">booming we took in other countries gold</text>
  <text start="955.92" dur="5.65">what is happening in China they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="959.41" dur="5.03">amassing a huge amount of gold so is</text>
  <text start="961.57" dur="5.04">Russia they have all the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="964.44" dur="4">they have the Belton Road that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="966.61" dur="3.9">building right now where it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="968.44" dur="4.61">go through all the manufacturing areas</text>
  <text start="970.51" dur="6.21">to distribute to the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="973.05" dur="5.68">they started the petro yuyuan they have</text>
  <text start="976.72" dur="4.14">all the exchanges like we do here in the</text>
  <text start="978.73" dur="5.07">United States they have the payment</text>
  <text start="980.86" dur="3.55">system like the Swift there&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="983.8" dur="3.31">but</text>
  <text start="984.41" dur="6.06">they duplicated it why do you think they</text>
  <text start="987.11" dur="6.779">did all this because everything is going</text>
  <text start="990.47" dur="5.609">to shift the question is is this going</text>
  <text start="993.889" dur="5.01">to be a central banking system or is</text>
  <text start="996.079" dur="5.13">this going to be a people run system now</text>
  <text start="998.899" dur="4.951">I do believe that they&amp;#39;re going to bring</text>
  <text start="1001.209" dur="5.401">cryptocurrencies into this I do believe</text>
  <text start="1003.85" dur="5.37">at a lower level that people will be</text>
  <text start="1006.61" dur="6.05">using crypto currencies and these</text>
  <text start="1009.22" dur="6.239">currencies will be within each country</text>
  <text start="1012.66" dur="5.619">just like it is today that each country</text>
  <text start="1015.459" dur="5.101">has their own fiat currency except for</text>
  <text start="1018.279" dur="3.87">the European Union where they all use</text>
  <text start="1020.56" dur="3.779">the same currency but this is when they</text>
  <text start="1022.149" dur="4.111">were trying to push their one-world</text>
  <text start="1024.339" dur="4.401">currency their one-world government and</text>
  <text start="1026.26" dur="5.789">this was the beginning stages of it now</text>
  <text start="1028.74" dur="6.01">it&amp;#39;s going to turn out that each country</text>
  <text start="1032.049" dur="5.701">most likely for the people&amp;#39;s usage will</text>
  <text start="1034.75" dur="5.49">have crypto currencies and it won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1037.75" dur="4.829">created by the central banking system at</text>
  <text start="1040.24" dur="5.429">higher levels governments might trade or</text>
  <text start="1042.579" dur="5.58">use a different currency but where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1045.669" dur="6.231">headed right now is for a very big</text>
  <text start="1048.159" dur="5.431">change a very big transition and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1051.9" dur="3.37">accelerating and it&amp;#39;s coming very</text>
  <text start="1053.59" dur="3.959">quickly you can see how much has been</text>
  <text start="1055.27" dur="5.01">done already and this is just going to</text>
  <text start="1057.549" dur="5.76">accelerate and the screams are going to</text>
  <text start="1060.28" dur="4.68">get louder and louder as Trump does more</text>
  <text start="1063.309" dur="3.811">and you&amp;#39;re gonna hear the screams from</text>
