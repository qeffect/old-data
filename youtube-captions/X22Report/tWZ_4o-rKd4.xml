  <text start="67.19" dur="5.039">from the Fed note the transition is</text>
  <text start="69.08" dur="5.97">happening quietly let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="72.229" dur="5.221">economic collapse financial news now the</text>
  <text start="75.05" dur="3.87">central banks they are out there and</text>
  <text start="77.45" dur="3.45">that it&amp;#39;s like they have a bullhorn and</text>
  <text start="78.92" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re screaming on the top of their</text>
  <text start="80.9" dur="6.87">lungs that there&amp;#39;s a great depression</text>
  <text start="83.99" dur="6.9">headed our way and they keep telling us</text>
  <text start="87.77" dur="6.81">that it&amp;#39;s going to be awful because of</text>
  <text start="90.89" dur="5.46">the us&amp;#39;s fiscal policies what basically</text>
  <text start="94.58" dur="4.709">what Trump is doing and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.35" dur="5.97">continually telling us all of this where</text>
  <text start="99.289" dur="6.091">they&amp;#39;re telling us that if this keeps up</text>
  <text start="102.32" dur="6.02">the entire system is going to collapse</text>
  <text start="105.38" dur="7.73">what&amp;#39;s actually happening right now is</text>
  <text start="108.34" dur="9.25">that the entire economic system is</text>
  <text start="113.11" dur="7.36">quietly moving to a new system we are</text>
  <text start="117.59" dur="5.37">transitioning right now right before our</text>
  <text start="120.47" dur="2.759">eyes it doesn&amp;#39;t happen with a snap of a</text>
  <text start="122.96" dur="2.88">finger</text>
  <text start="123.229" dur="4.171">everything has to be prepped just like</text>
  <text start="125.84" dur="4.169">the central bankers were prepping</text>
  <text start="127.4" dur="4.559">everything to be moved away from the</text>
  <text start="130.009" dur="4.501">United States and they did this very</text>
  <text start="131.959" dur="5.37">slowly and methodically the difference</text>
  <text start="134.51" dur="5.52">here today is that there&amp;#39;s not that much</text>
  <text start="137.329" dur="5.791">time Trump has been in office around two</text>
  <text start="140.03" dur="5.34">years or so and again the central</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="3.929">bankers had many many years to move</text>
  <text start="145.37" dur="4.56">everything away and to bring everything</text>
  <text start="147.049" dur="5.28">back in just a year or two is a very</text>
  <text start="149.93" dur="4.17">difficult task and most likely it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="152.329" dur="4.951">be accomplished within this period of</text>
  <text start="154.1" dur="5.19">time what can be accomplished is setting</text>
  <text start="157.28" dur="4.08">everything up so when we enter this</text>
  <text start="159.29" dur="4.259">transition we can start moving things</text>
  <text start="161.36" dur="5.159">back here that means getting rid of</text>
  <text start="163.549" dur="4.711">certain deals giving tax incentives and</text>
  <text start="166.519" dur="3.181">things like that to make sure that the</text>
  <text start="168.26" dur="3.21">companies do come back that they</text>
  <text start="169.7" dur="4.319">promised to come back here</text>
  <text start="171.47" dur="5.7">some of them will some of them won&amp;#39;t but</text>
  <text start="174.019" dur="6.661">you need to make the u.s. prepared and</text>
  <text start="177.17" dur="5.67">ready for this major major transition</text>
  <text start="180.68" dur="3.959">which we&amp;#39;re going through right now the</text>
  <text start="182.84" dur="3.929">economy is breaking down very very</text>
  <text start="184.639" dur="2.43">quickly and if we look at Sears right</text>
  <text start="186.769" dur="1.47">now</text>
  <text start="187.069" dur="2.851">we can see that Sears they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="188.239" dur="4.47">putting off bankruptcy they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="189.92" dur="5.219">bailed out with a lot more debt and it</text>
  <text start="192.709" dur="4.321">looks like it&amp;#39;s time for them to go</text>
  <text start="195.139" dur="4.231">bankrupt and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more</text>
  <text start="197.03" dur="4.56">stores go bankrupt as we move forward</text>
  <text start="199.37" dur="5.31">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting as we know</text>
  <text start="201.59" dur="5.58">the IMF is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.68" dur="4.919">continually telling us that something</text>
  <text start="207.17" dur="4.89">bad is headed our way a severe recession</text>
  <text start="209.599" dur="5.64">or the Second Great Depression now the</text>
  <text start="212.06" dur="5.459">IMF they came out with another global</text>
  <text start="215.239" dur="5.67">economic forecast and for the first time</text>
  <text start="217.519" dur="6.45">since 2016 saw the DC based organization</text>
  <text start="220.909" dur="6.571">cut its global growth forecast they are</text>
  <text start="223.969" dur="8.821">warning now that if we enter this Great</text>
  <text start="227.48" dur="10.439">Depression we could slash the US public</text>
  <text start="232.79" dur="7.05">wealth by five trillion dollars at the</text>
  <text start="237.919" dur="4.231">same time governments around the world</text>
  <text start="239.84" dur="4.56">many of which faced similar dangers do</text>
  <text start="242.15" dur="5.069">not clearly publicize their overall net</text>
  <text start="244.4" dur="4.979">worths the IMF said in a new report</text>
  <text start="247.219" dur="4.83">noting that few governments know how</text>
  <text start="249.379" dur="6">much they own or how they use those</text>
  <text start="252.049" dur="5.011">assets for public&amp;#39;s well-being now</text>
  <text start="255.379" dur="3.961">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about what the</text>
  <text start="257.06" dur="6.3">IMF is saying here is they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="8.1">that countries they should start to look</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="9.149">at their assets and see what they own</text>
  <text start="267.44" dur="8.099">and how much they owe and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.509" dur="5.461">saying here is the following knowing</text>
  <text start="275.539" dur="4.291">what a government owns and how they can</text>
  <text start="277.97" dur="4.319">put their assets to better use matters</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="4.769">because they can earn about 3 percent of</text>
  <text start="282.289" dur="6.181">GDP more in revenues each year and</text>
  <text start="284.599" dur="6.81">reduce risks the IMF right now is</text>
  <text start="288.47" dur="5.52">desperate they want countries to push</text>
  <text start="291.409" dur="4.5">austerity they want countries to look at</text>
  <text start="293.99" dur="5.91">what assets they have maybe use them as</text>
  <text start="295.909" dur="7.411">collateral or sell them off and the IMF</text>
  <text start="299.9" dur="5.04">right now is looking at different assets</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="4.14">and the assets they&amp;#39;re talking about is</text>
  <text start="304.94" dur="6.18">public infrastructure such as roads</text>
  <text start="307.46" dur="5.639">bridges sewer pipes as well as the money</text>
  <text start="311.12" dur="5.46">governments have in the bank their</text>
  <text start="313.099" dur="6.901">financial investments payments all of it</text>
  <text start="316.58" dur="6.11">that&amp;#39;s owed to them or these two</text>
  <text start="320" dur="5.91">assets that they can use as collateral</text>
  <text start="322.69" dur="5.5">the IMF is saying that natural resource</text>
  <text start="325.91" dur="3.87">reserves in the ground are also part of</text>
  <text start="328.19" dur="2.97">the asses something that is particularly</text>
  <text start="329.78" dur="3.84">important for natural resource rich</text>
  <text start="331.16" dur="4.56">countries but assets also include</text>
  <text start="333.62" dur="4.98">state-owned enterprise such as public</text>
  <text start="335.72" dur="4.77">banks and in many countries utilities</text>
  <text start="338.6" dur="7.08">such as public electricity and water</text>
  <text start="340.49" dur="7.92">companies they want countries now to use</text>
  <text start="345.68" dur="6.17">whatever they have to put this off</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="6.09">because they know that their system is</text>
  <text start="351.85" dur="5.65">imploding very very quickly remember it</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="5">wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to go this long we were</text>
  <text start="357.5" dur="5.4">supposed to have an event already and</text>
  <text start="359.5" dur="6.34">they know that this is going to crash</text>
  <text start="362.9" dur="5.34">and it&amp;#39;s going to implode on itself and</text>
  <text start="365.84" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re trying to get countries to stop</text>
  <text start="368.24" dur="4.41">this to put it off a little bit longer</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="6.15">so they can get someone in place where</text>
  <text start="372.65" dur="5.64">we can have an event and we see that the</text>
  <text start="376.64" dur="4.5">central banks are very very worried</text>
  <text start="378.29" dur="5.79">about this I mean if we look at the US</text>
  <text start="381.14" dur="5.97">right now the United States has been in</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="5.25">decline for nearly four decades and so</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="4.02">has many other countries because the</text>
  <text start="389.33" dur="6.39">central bank system doesn&amp;#39;t last that</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="7.56">long now the US financial crisis has</text>
  <text start="395.72" dur="6.72">sunk by negative seventeen percent in</text>
  <text start="398.69" dur="5.28">2016 as a share of GDP the federal</text>
  <text start="402.44" dur="4.41">mortgage giants like Fannie Mae and</text>
  <text start="403.97" dur="4.77">Freddie Mac which the government took</text>
  <text start="406.85" dur="4.65">over during the crisis have lent a</text>
  <text start="408.74" dur="5.19">staggering amount forty-four percent of</text>
  <text start="411.5" dur="4.62">GDP to the private sector but the</text>
  <text start="413.93" dur="4.77">biggest source of risk come from state</text>
  <text start="416.12" dur="3.78">and local government retirement pensions</text>
  <text start="418.7" dur="3.96">which we discussed many many times</text>
  <text start="419.9" dur="6.15">before which can lose money when Wall</text>
  <text start="422.66" dur="5.22">Street sinks meaning the shortfall has</text>
  <text start="426.05" dur="3.57">to come out of local government budgets</text>
  <text start="427.88" dur="3.9">towns and states that have to cut</text>
  <text start="429.62" dur="5.46">spending elsewhere creating a drag on</text>
  <text start="431.78" dur="6.27">the economy so we have a lot of debt the</text>
  <text start="435.08" dur="4.83">global economy is imploding they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="438.05" dur="5.67">saying it&amp;#39;s because of what the US is</text>
  <text start="439.91" dur="5.91">doing and this all started in 2016 when</text>
  <text start="443.72" dur="5.58">Trump came into office I mean it seems</text>
  <text start="445.82" dur="6.48">kind of coincidental that all this just</text>
  <text start="449.3" dur="4.8">so happened to start at that time know</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="3.96">what really happened was it was</text>
  <text start="454.1" dur="4.05">always declining if you remember we</text>
  <text start="456.26" dur="3.99">reported on this many many times before</text>
  <text start="458.15" dur="5.43">every time the IMF put out a for scat</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="5.01">forecast during Obama&amp;#39;s term the</text>
  <text start="463.58" dur="3.78">forecast was always three point eight</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="3.87">three point nine four percent GDP and</text>
  <text start="467.36" dur="5.6">they always lowered it as it came to the</text>
  <text start="469.13" dur="7.35">real number of the GDP numbers and they</text>
  <text start="472.96" dur="4.9">adjusted but the initial report where it</text>
  <text start="476.48" dur="2.64">went all over the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="2.97">everyone was like wow the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="4.26">doing great this is fantastic</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="4.38">and then we came in at two percent two</text>
  <text start="483.38" dur="4.2">point one percent sometimes one point</text>
  <text start="485.21" dur="6.03">nine percent it was absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="487.58" dur="5.01">the economy has not improved what</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;ve done was they manipulated the</text>
  <text start="492.59" dur="3.9">statistical these statistical numbers to</text>
  <text start="494.45" dur="4.2">make it look like the economy is</text>
  <text start="496.49" dur="5.82">improving that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="498.65" dur="5.43">nothing else everything else is status</text>
  <text start="502.31" dur="3.27">quo they haven&amp;#39;t done anything else what</text>
  <text start="504.08" dur="4.38">Trump is doing right now and the</text>
  <text start="505.58" dur="5.67">Patriots they are preparing for this</text>
  <text start="508.46" dur="5.94">major transition the central bank&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="5.69">worrying and they&amp;#39;re panicking right now</text>
  <text start="514.4" dur="5.25">because they know their system is</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="4.69">imploding on itself they also know that</text>
  <text start="519.65" dur="5.34">Trump continually contradicts the Fed</text>
  <text start="521.63" dur="5.49">and they&amp;#39;re telling countries listen we</text>
  <text start="524.99" dur="3.92">need your help right now you need to</text>
