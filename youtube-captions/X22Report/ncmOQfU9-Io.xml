  <text start="156.19" dur="8.16">magic wand Trump but this brings up a</text>
  <text start="160.21" dur="6.23">very interesting point because you know</text>
  <text start="164.35" dur="4.28">it states through manipulation of course</text>
  <text start="166.44" dur="6.37">the United States looks like it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="6.09">fantastically unemployment GDP and it</text>
  <text start="172.81" dur="4.32">looks like the stock market is</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="5.89">continually rising yes it dips down</text>
  <text start="177.13" dur="7.74">every so often so the United States is</text>
  <text start="180.61" dur="7.44">standing tall through manipulation the</text>
  <text start="184.87" dur="7.58">rest of the world the EU with all the</text>
  <text start="188.05" dur="9.06">different nations Asia it looks like</text>
  <text start="192.45" dur="8.98">that whole entire space is not doing</text>
  <text start="197.11" dur="7.44">well think about this for a second why</text>
  <text start="201.43" dur="5.4">would the United States be doing so well</text>
  <text start="204.55" dur="5.19">through manipulation and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="206.83" dur="7.11">world they can&amp;#39;t do anything about it</text>
  <text start="209.74" dur="7.02">but expose how the central bank system</text>
  <text start="213.94" dur="4.98">is collapsing we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="5.13">about that in just a minute but first</text>
  <text start="218.92" dur="5.4">let&amp;#39;s head out to the UK and we see May</text>
  <text start="221.89" dur="5.76">is out there and she&amp;#39;s looking for a</text>
  <text start="224.32" dur="6.3">delay she tried pushing her deal</text>
  <text start="227.65" dur="5.55">actually the --use deal through and it</text>
  <text start="230.62" dur="5.55">was rejected twice and now she&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="233.2" dur="5.91">for delay but not a very long delay or a</text>
  <text start="236.17" dur="5.1">long extension she calls it but we need</text>
  <text start="239.11" dur="4.2">something where people can talk about it</text>
  <text start="241.27" dur="4.14">and then we can vote back you know on my</text>
  <text start="243.31" dur="4.35">deal again and I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="245.41" dur="5.85">going to work and I don&amp;#39;t think the EU</text>
  <text start="247.66" dur="8.43">is going to change the deal I think the</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="8.82">EU and certain individuals want the UK</text>
  <text start="256.09" dur="8.64">in limbo and they&amp;#39;re getting what they</text>
  <text start="260.08" dur="6.26">want now it&amp;#39;s very interesting here in</text>
  <text start="264.73" dur="4.74">the United States and around the world</text>
  <text start="266.34" dur="6.28">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing precious metals move</text>
  <text start="269.47" dur="4.11">up and we know that the central bankers</text>
  <text start="272.62" dur="3.42">around the world</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="5.07">they like to manipulate gold and silver</text>
  <text start="276.04" dur="6.66">and how do they do this well they throw</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="5.79">paper contracts at gold and silver it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.7" dur="4.2">not really gold and silver it&amp;#39;s paper</text>
  <text start="284.44" dur="4.95">stuff they made up to say that this is</text>
  <text start="286.9" dur="6.54">gold and silver so what happened it</text>
  <text start="289.39" dur="7.74">looks like they dumped 1 billion of</text>
  <text start="293.44" dur="6.95">paper gold into the future markets</text>
  <text start="297.13" dur="7.2">what did that do it send precious metals</text>
  <text start="300.39" dur="6.19">below 1300 but if you know notice</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="6.14">something very interesting every time</text>
  <text start="306.58" dur="8.16">they do this the recovery time is</text>
  <text start="310.47" dur="5.71">shorter and shorter which means every</text>
  <text start="314.74" dur="3.72">time they try to bring down gold and</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="6.39">silver gold and silver doesn&amp;#39;t stay</text>
  <text start="318.46" dur="8.43">there it pops right back up which means</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re losing some control here and we</text>
  <text start="326.89" dur="5.04">need to understand is that these central</text>
  <text start="329.44" dur="6.26">bankers they&amp;#39;re trying to keep their</text>
  <text start="331.93" dur="7.89">system alive but they&amp;#39;re exposed and</text>
  <text start="335.7" dur="7.45">like we&amp;#39;ve been mentioning Powell well</text>
  <text start="339.82" dur="5.55">he is not going to raise rates the Fed</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="5.72">will taper its balance sheet roll-off</text>
  <text start="345.37" dur="7.86">and this will be ending in September and</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="7.6">it looks like Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="353.23" dur="5.91">have just controlled it all now very</text>
  <text start="356.47" dur="6.3">interestingly something happened and I</text>
