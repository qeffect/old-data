  <text start="78.67" dur="5.22">points maybe 30 thousand points it</text>
  <text start="80.98" dur="5.46">really doesn&amp;#39;t matter because when</text>
  <text start="83.89" dur="5.61">something is manipulated when the Swiss</text>

  <text start="89.5" dur="5.64">the Fed are manipulating the stock</text>
  <text start="92.2" dur="6.18">market it&amp;#39;s really absolutely</text>
  <text start="95.14" dur="5.52">meaningless and when we look at what is</text>
  <text start="98.38" dur="5.01">really going on in the economy we can</text>
  <text start="100.66" dur="5.22">see that things are breaking down very</text>
  <text start="103.39" dur="5.78">very quickly now we talked about the</text>
  <text start="105.88" dur="6.3">Toronto real estate market before and</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="6.309">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="112.18" dur="5.43">whole entire market well it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="115.479" dur="3.721">to fall apart now the Toronto real</text>

  <text start="120.42" dur="6.94">well they suffered their biggest monthly</text>
  <text start="123.64" dur="5.82">drum on record and we could see at this</text>
  <text start="127.36" dur="4.53">point that the prices have dropped by</text>
  <text start="129.46" dur="3.84">four point six percent and more</text>
  <text start="131.89" dur="4.23">troubling than the prices the price</text>
  <text start="133.3" dur="5.73">gigantic price drop is that the buyers</text>
  <text start="136.12" dur="6.33">and sellers they&amp;#39;re disagreeing about</text>
  <text start="139.03" dur="5.67">fair clearing prices and right now</text>
  <text start="142.45" dur="4.77">transactions have tumbled by forty point</text>
  <text start="144.7" dur="5.58">four percent and this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="147.22" dur="7.2">year-over-year decline since 2009 and we</text>
  <text start="150.28" dur="7.14">know what happened in 2009 when we look</text>
  <text start="154.42" dur="5.46">at Manhattan when we look at San</text>
  <text start="157.42" dur="5.25">Francisco when we look at all the major</text>
  <text start="159.88" dur="4.89">cities well we&amp;#39;re going to see huge</text>
  <text start="162.67" dur="5.7">problems in the real estate market in</text>
  <text start="164.77" dur="6.299">these cities the reason why is because a</text>
  <text start="168.37" dur="5.19">lot of these purchases have been have</text>
  <text start="171.069" dur="4.951">been made by foreign investors have been</text>
  <text start="173.56" dur="5.61">made by hedge funds investment companies</text>
  <text start="176.02" dur="6.2">they haven&amp;#39;t been made by the everyday</text>
  <text start="179.17" dur="6.51">American or the wealthy American and</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="5.799">what happens when a foreign</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="5.669">country decides you know what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="188.019" dur="6.541">going to implement new rules and it cuts</text>
  <text start="191.349" dur="5.461">off the spicket of money flowing into</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="4.47">the United States well this is what</text>
  <text start="196.81" dur="5.129">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now the Chinese</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="5.129">government latest crackdown on capital</text>
  <text start="201.939" dur="4.651">outflows and corporate leverage well</text>
  <text start="204.159" dur="5.791">it&amp;#39;s intensifying right now and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.59" dur="5.25">really bad news for these big cities</text>
  <text start="209.95" dur="4.53">like Manhattan now these new</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="4.319">restrictions that are being imposed on a</text>
  <text start="214.48" dur="5.25">lot of these different Chinese companies</text>
  <text start="216.159" dur="5.821">well they will likely lead to an 84</text>
  <text start="219.73" dur="4.679">percent drop in Chinese overseas</text>
  <text start="221.98" dur="5.67">property investment this year and a</text>
  <text start="224.409" dur="5.491">further 18 percent most likely by 2018</text>
  <text start="227.65" dur="7.05">now the markets that are most vulnerable</text>
  <text start="229.9" dur="7.649">to this slowdown is the u.s. the UK Hong</text>
  <text start="234.7" dur="5.28">Kong Australia with commercial</text>
  <text start="237.549" dur="4.261">properties the most valuable now</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="5.429">Manhattan commercial real estate prices</text>
  <text start="241.81" dur="5.819">could fall by quite a bit here and</text>
  <text start="245.409" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re worried that these prices might</text>
  <text start="247.629" dur="6.72">fall by 30 percent if they pull out from</text>
  <text start="251.319" dur="5.73">these markets and we see at this point</text>
  <text start="254.349" dur="5.281">that if this does happen and is already</text>
  <text start="257.049" dur="5.521">started it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="5.969">disaster and the real estate market is</text>
  <text start="262.57" dur="5.279">going to implode now we understand that</text>
  <text start="265.599" dur="4.1">the banks have been out there saying</text>
  <text start="267.849" dur="4.56">that listen we can&amp;#39;t lend to the people</text>
  <text start="269.699" dur="6.131">because you know we just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="272.409" dur="5.25">enough funds to do this and if Congress</text>
  <text start="275.83" dur="4.35">would just you know remove some of the</text>
  <text start="277.659" dur="6.811">restrictions this would just really help</text>
  <text start="280.18" dur="6.69">us out now the FDIC vice-chairman thomas</text>
  <text start="284.47" dur="4.62">hoening he is in front of the Senate</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="7.169">Banking Committee and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="289.09" dur="7.44">this is absolute nonsense the banks are</text>
  <text start="294.039" dur="5.041">full of it he said if the bank&amp;#39;s wanted</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="4.919">to increase lending they could easily do</text>
  <text start="299.08" dur="4.29">so without lower capital requirements</text>
  <text start="301.449" dur="4.381">and he pointed out something very</text>
  <text start="303.37" dur="5.01">interesting that the ten largest bank</text>
  <text start="305.83" dur="6.929">holding companies in the u.s. plowed</text>
  <text start="308.38" dur="7.289">over 100 percent of their earnings into</text>
  <text start="312.759" dur="5.731">the share buybacks and dividends if they</text>
  <text start="315.669" dur="3.751">had retained more of their income they</text>
  <text start="318.49" dur="5.52">could have boosted</text>
  <text start="319.42" dur="8.63">lending by one trillion dollars but that</text>
  <text start="324.01" dur="6.84">would be a problem because all of this</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="6.1">created currency out of thin air that</text>
  <text start="330.85" dur="6.03">the Fed is doing that would enter the</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="6.51">public domain if that entered the public</text>
  <text start="336.88" dur="7.05">domain guess what there be more dollars</text>
  <text start="340.66" dur="5.97">in circulation that means we would have</text>
  <text start="343.93" dur="5.4">inflation this is why they told the</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="4.59">bank&amp;#39;s buy back your stock pump it into</text>
  <text start="349.33" dur="6.38">the stock market pump up the stock</text>
  <text start="351.22" dur="7.92">market so he was looking at the entire</text>
  <text start="355.71" dur="6.34">banking system as he was telling the</text>
  <text start="359.14" dur="5.13">Senate and he said that listen these</text>
  <text start="362.05" dur="4.71">banks they could be lending right now</text>
  <text start="364.27" dur="4.53">has nothing to do with regulations the</text>
  <text start="366.76" dur="4.29">largest banks on his list JPMorgan Chase</text>
  <text start="368.8" dur="5.88">earned around 26 billion over the four</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="6.39">quarters but a ploughed 27 point six</text>
  <text start="374.68" dur="5.34">billion or a hundred percent 106 percent</text>
  <text start="377.44" dur="5.64">of his income into the share buybacks</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="5.64">and dividends if it retained that income</text>
  <text start="383.08" dur="4.53">it would have raised its capital by that</text>
  <text start="385.66" dur="3.99">amount and it would have been enough to</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="5.49">make an additional 250 billion of loans</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="5.46">under current capital rules and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="393.1" dur="4.02">looking at this and saying that all of</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="4.47">these banks are full of it they just</text>
  <text start="397.12" dur="4.08">want deregulation right now they could</text>
  <text start="399.58" dur="4.19">be lending out with no problem but</text>
  <text start="401.2" dur="5.43">remember the central banking system is</text>
  <text start="403.77" dur="4.66">controlling what they are doing now we</text>
  <text start="406.63" dur="4.83">know the central bank they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="5.49">currency out of thin air and they know</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="5.67">that if this currency because they</text>
  <text start="413.92" dur="5.31">created a lot if it hits the public this</text>
  <text start="417.13" dur="4.05">would be a huge problem this is why</text>
  <text start="419.23" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;ve been keeping it within the</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="6">system which it benefits the stock</text>
  <text start="424.09" dur="7.62">market it benefits the banks it benefits</text>
  <text start="427.18" dur="6.75">the elite not the everyday person so we</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="4.32">see right now that what the banks are</text>
  <text start="433.93" dur="5.46">saying well it&amp;#39;s turning out to be a</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="5.55">complete lie we see that the US services</text>
  <text start="439.39" dur="5.73">economy they have crashed 211 month lows</text>
  <text start="441.58" dur="5.49">and we see the is M which is the service</text>
  <text start="445.12" dur="4.62">industry that is collapse new orders are</text>
  <text start="447.07" dur="5.53">collapsing and we can see manufacturing</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="4.93">is collapsing the sir</text>
  <text start="452.6" dur="4.35">versus industry that is collapsing and</text>
  <text start="454.67" dur="4.62">we need to understand that all of this</text>
  <text start="456.95" dur="4.95">is part of the same exact thing now</text>
  <text start="459.29" dur="4.86">remember the economy has been shifting</text>
  <text start="461.9" dur="4.83">into different areas because as the</text>
  <text start="464.15" dur="5.64">economy economy breaks down and as the</text>
  <text start="466.73" dur="6.2">deep state the central bank&amp;#39;s continue</text>
  <text start="469.79" dur="6.21">continually moved everything overseas</text>
  <text start="472.93" dur="5.83">well they had it come up with some type</text>
  <text start="476" dur="4.29">of explanation of why the economy looks</text>
  <text start="478.76" dur="2.19">the way it is and why it&amp;#39;s functioning</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="2.52">the way it is</text>
  <text start="480.95" dur="3.27">think about it when Nixon took us off</text>
  <text start="482.81" dur="4.1">the gold standard they made up the</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="6.36">excuse that they were speculators and</text>
  <text start="486.91" dur="5.89">now we come to understand that this had</text>
  <text start="490.58" dur="3.81">nothing to do with speculators this had</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="4.11">to do with countries who wanted their</text>
  <text start="494.39" dur="4.59">goal back this had to do with the United</text>
  <text start="496.91" dur="6.54">States coming off the gold standard and</text>
  <text start="498.98" dur="5.97">going on to the petrodollar system so we</text>
  <text start="503.45" dur="4.44">see the same thing happening right now</text>
  <text start="504.95" dur="4.5">the economy is shifting into many</text>
  <text start="507.89" dur="3.96">different areas because as it breaks</text>
  <text start="509.45" dur="4.529">down they have to explain away why this</text>
  <text start="511.85" dur="4.56">is all happening why we lost a</text>
  <text start="513.979" dur="4.5">manufacturing why the service economy is</text>
  <text start="516.41" dur="3.84">not doing well why the housing market is</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="3.631">not doing well why we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="520.25" dur="3.45">illusion and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="522.11" dur="5.16">continually do this in to the very very</text>
  <text start="523.7" dur="5.34">end now we have visit debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="527.27" dur="3.33">coming up and we know it&amp;#39;s coming up</text>
  <text start="529.04" dur="3.57">very very soon as the end of September</text>
  <text start="530.6" dur="3.99">we know that Congress is going on</text>
  <text start="532.61" dur="4.02">vacation they don&amp;#39;t return until after</text>
  <text start="534.59" dur="5.33">Labor Day and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="536.63" dur="6.36">it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter what they do</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="6.28">it&amp;#39;s too late for that it&amp;#39;s like saying</text>
  <text start="542.99" dur="5.73">to a household who&amp;#39;s bringing in $50,000</text>
  <text start="546.2" dur="4.86">a year and has $500,000 worth of debt</text>
  <text start="548.72" dur="5.49">saying hey listen at this point we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="551.06" dur="5.55">going to put a debt ceiling and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="554.21" dur="6.06">not going to be able to do anything well</text>
  <text start="556.61" dur="7.83">they have $500,000 debt they cannot meet</text>
  <text start="560.27" dur="7.35">the everyday payment of the $500,000</text>
  <text start="564.44" dur="4.11">debt yeah they can&amp;#39;t take out more but</text>
  <text start="567.62" dur="2.49">guess what they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="568.55" dur="5.4">eventually do they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="570.11" dur="6.18">declare bankruptcy to reset what they</text>
  <text start="573.95" dur="4.08">have here because the $50,000 coming in</text>
  <text start="576.29" dur="3.18">is just not enough this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.03" dur="4.8">seeing this is what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="579.47" dur="6.52">now in the country the amount of debt</text>
  <text start="582.83" dur="5.26">and the fake unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="585.99" dur="4.26">well they give the illusion that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="588.09" dur="4.02">at full employment but when you look at</text>
  <text start="590.25" dur="2.43">the tax receipts you see that the tax</text>
  <text start="592.11" dur="3.48">receipts</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="4.2">well they don&amp;#39;t even cover what the</text>
  <text start="595.59" dur="4.22">government is spending and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="596.88" dur="7.05">even cover how much we owe on the loans</text>
  <text start="599.81" dur="6.4">which goes back to the Fed so even if</text>
  <text start="603.93" dur="3.48">they implement the debt ceiling there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.21" dur="3.84">no way to do anything</text>
  <text start="607.41" dur="5.97">people can&amp;#39;t still find work people are</text>
  <text start="610.05" dur="4.89">working at lower paying jobs and the tax</text>
  <text start="613.38" dur="4.38">receipts coming into the federal</text>
  <text start="614.94" dur="3.96">government it just doesn&amp;#39;t work so</text>
  <text start="617.76" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;re going to make this big argument</text>
  <text start="618.9" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;re going to go back and forth</text>
  <text start="620.37" dur="2.46">eventually they&amp;#39;re going to raise the</text>
  <text start="621.63" dur="4.38">debt ceiling because they have no other</text>
  <text start="622.83" dur="4.98">choice but to do this and the scenario</text>
  <text start="626.01" dur="4.59">is always the same but what we see</text>
  <text start="627.81" dur="5.25">happening right now is that as they</text>
  <text start="630.6" dur="4.86">worry about that instead of worrying</text>
  <text start="633.06" dur="4.41">about is this a real economy is the</text>
  <text start="635.46" dur="3.66">economy deteriorating no we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="637.47" dur="4.05">fine because we&amp;#39;re receiving money free</text>
  <text start="639.12" dur="5.19">money from the Fed from foreign entities</text>
  <text start="641.52" dur="4.53">from you know corporations this is why</text>
  <text start="644.31" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re so blinded in what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="646.05" dur="6.66">going on they&amp;#39;re completely out of touch</text>
  <text start="648.69" dur="5.31">with real America and when we look at</text>
  <text start="652.71" dur="2.55">all these different bubbles and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654" dur="3.42">many bubbles all over the place the</text>
  <text start="655.26" dur="5.18">student loan bubble the stock market</text>
  <text start="657.42" dur="5.7">bubble the bond bubble the the</text>
  <text start="660.44" dur="4.99">automobile bubble we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="663.12" dur="6.26">subprime auto loan industry</text>
  <text start="665.43" dur="7.44">well this bubble is starting to pop and</text>
  <text start="669.38" dur="5.74">we had this back in 2008 and that was</text>
  <text start="672.87" dur="4.44">with the housing industry and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.12" dur="5.61">seeing is that the value of the</text>
  <text start="677.31" dur="5.04">underlying assets in these subprime</text>
  <text start="680.73" dur="4.35">securities of the auto loans that are</text>

  <text start="689.19" dur="5.58">they are slowing right now and even</text>
  <text start="692.19" dur="4.65">worse the total vehicle sales they have</text>

  <text start="696.84" dur="5.79">despite ridiculous offer such as 0% down</text>
  <text start="699.3" dur="5.67">and interest refinancing and this is a</text>
  <text start="702.63" dur="5.07">major warning that the credit cycle is</text>
  <text start="704.97" dur="5.04">once again turning so when we look at</text>
  <text start="707.7" dur="4.71">this we can see that yes sales are down</text>
  <text start="710.01" dur="4.77">the underlying values in these</text>
  <text start="712.41" dur="4.05">securities they&amp;#39;re garbage once again</text>
  <text start="714.78" dur="4.97">because they&amp;#39;re made up of subprime</text>
  <text start="716.46" dur="5.87">individuals the bubble is bur</text>
  <text start="719.75" dur="4.77">thing right now and it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="722.33" dur="4.92">worse before it gets better</text>
  <text start="724.52" dur="4.44">and this time we&amp;#39;re going to see that</text>
  <text start="727.25" dur="3.96">this time we&amp;#39;re going to have to go</text>
  <text start="728.96" dur="4.17">through this transition the stimulus</text>
  <text start="731.21" dur="3.93">from the central bank which they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="733.13" dur="4.2">going to do and the most likely going to</text>
  <text start="735.14" dur="3.66">lower the rates quite a bit this is not</text>
  <text start="737.33" dur="3.24">going to help the economy because the</text>
  <text start="738.8" dur="3.66">real economy well it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="740.57" dur="3.9">falling apart at this point they might</text>
  <text start="742.46" dur="3.48">try helicopter money where they just say</text>
  <text start="744.47" dur="3.96">here take the free money take the free</text>
  <text start="745.94" dur="4.98">money spend it but most people I think I</text>
  <text start="748.43" dur="4.62">know for myself are just going to use it</text>
  <text start="750.92" dur="3.99">just to live on if they actually do this</text>
  <text start="753.05" dur="5.61">and once again</text>
  <text start="754.91" dur="5.43">this money will also be taxed so this is</text>
  <text start="758.66" dur="4.95">going to turn out to be a no situation</text>
  <text start="760.34" dur="5.46">it might look great in the beginning but</text>
  <text start="763.61" dur="4.14">a couple months down the line it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="765.8" dur="4.89">to completely fall apart because it will</text>
  <text start="767.75" dur="6.05">not be able to support the entire</text>
  <text start="770.69" dur="6.99">economy it will be completely impossible</text>
  <text start="773.8" dur="6.63">now Trump is out there and he is ready</text>
  <text start="777.68" dur="5.16">to launch trade war with China and</text>
  <text start="780.43" dur="4.3">Beijing of course is saying listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="782.84" dur="4.23">going to retaliate against the United</text>
  <text start="784.73" dur="5.76">States if they start to do this now when</text>
  <text start="787.07" dur="6.45">we really look at this if Trump really</text>
  <text start="790.49" dur="6.84">goes through with this trade war with</text>
  <text start="793.52" dur="5.64">China who do you think is going to be</text>
  <text start="797.33" dur="4.17">the winner and who do you really think</text>
  <text start="799.16" dur="5.25">is going to be the loser or is this</text>
  <text start="801.5" dur="6.6">really being set up for the transition</text>
  <text start="804.41" dur="6.75">because right now we need to have a jolt</text>
  <text start="808.1" dur="6.69">and shock to the system now think about</text>
  <text start="811.16" dur="7.53">this for a second yes the US has the</text>
  <text start="814.79" dur="8.58">reserve currency of the world but the US</text>
  <text start="818.69" dur="7.83">doesn&amp;#39;t really produce that much who is</text>
  <text start="823.37" dur="6.03">the manufacturing powerhouse when you go</text>
  <text start="826.52" dur="6.48">to stores most of the products they made</text>
  <text start="829.4" dur="7.58">in China now if the United States goes</text>
  <text start="833" dur="7.11">ahead and they implement tariffs</text>
  <text start="836.98" dur="7.63">sanctions and they start this trade war</text>
  <text start="840.11" dur="8.42">and China decides to follow through and</text>
  <text start="844.61" dur="7.74">say you know something you want to play</text>
  <text start="848.53" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re going to place sanctions tariffs</text>
  <text start="852.35" dur="6.25">or do whatever they need to do</text>
  <text start="853.63" dur="10.379">on the United States on every piece of</text>
  <text start="858.6" dur="8.53">product that we create well all the</text>
  <text start="864.009" dur="4.94">products that we import they come to a</text>
  <text start="867.13" dur="5.399">screeching halt the majority of them</text>
  <text start="868.949" dur="5.111">it&amp;#39;s going to hurt the businesses here</text>
  <text start="872.529" dur="4.261">in the United States it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="874.06" dur="6.12">hurt China China has the rest of the</text>
  <text start="876.79" dur="5.76">world to deliver their manufactured</text>
  <text start="880.18" dur="4.649">products yes they might slow a little</text>
  <text start="882.55" dur="4.709">bit but you think Walmart&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="884.829" dur="5.07">well no a lot of people out of work</text>
  <text start="887.259" dur="5.221">you think K Mart&amp;#39;s going to do well</text>
  <text start="889.899" dur="4.62">while they&amp;#39;re already doing poorly how</text>
  <text start="892.48" dur="4.409">about all the other chain stores when</text>
  <text start="894.519" dur="3.12">you look at the tag most of it is made</text>
  <text start="896.889" dur="6.62">right there</text>
  <text start="897.639" dur="10.581">it&amp;#39;s going to hurt the retail industry</text>
  <text start="903.509" dur="12.31">we consume right now we don&amp;#39;t produce</text>
  <text start="908.22" dur="9.969">China produces they can outlast the</text>
  <text start="915.819" dur="5.281">United States in this war now I think</text>
  <text start="918.189" dur="5.52">Trump understands this and I think what</text>
  <text start="921.1" dur="6.81">he&amp;#39;s trying to do at this point is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="923.709" dur="7.201">trying to jolt the system and bring back</text>
  <text start="927.91" dur="5.609">manufacturing because eventually this is</text>
  <text start="930.91" dur="5.4">going to happen if we stop importing</text>
  <text start="933.519" dur="5.55">from China he&amp;#39;s going to force everyone</text>
  <text start="936.31" dur="5.07">to create things here to survive right</text>
  <text start="939.069" dur="6.061">because he knows China is going to</text>
  <text start="941.38" dur="7.019">create or push through different types</text>
  <text start="945.13" dur="5.91">of sanctions if they go that far and the</text>
  <text start="948.399" dur="7.74">United States at that point has no other</text>
  <text start="951.04" dur="8.489">choice but to start producing because</text>
  <text start="956.139" dur="6.69">one way or another I mean this economy</text>
  <text start="959.529" dur="6.601">is not going to last we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="962.829" dur="5.641">seen all the red flags reverse we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="966.13" dur="6.54">seen all the signs and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="968.47" dur="7.049">a complete disaster and when it does hit</text>
  <text start="972.67" dur="4.409">and we have no manufacturing here I mean</text>
  <text start="975.519" dur="4.651">he tried he tried to make deals with</text>
  <text start="977.079" dur="4.891">different corporations but in there</text>
  <text start="980.17" dur="4.889">going to those countries that have</text>
  <text start="981.97" dur="4.529">hardly any regulations they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="985.059" dur="3.93">those countries that have tax Ben</text>
  <text start="986.499" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re going to those countries</text>
  <text start="988.989" dur="4.44">that are giving other benefits and the</text>
  <text start="991.809" dur="4.65">United States has nothing to offer right</text>
  <text start="993.429" dur="6.06">now this is why all these companies left</text>
  <text start="996.459" dur="5.4">actually this was created by the central</text>
  <text start="999.489" dur="5.34">bank the deep state and it pretty much</text>
  <text start="1001.859" dur="4.98">forced all these countries all these</text>
  <text start="1004.829" dur="4.38">companies out of the country now this</text>
  <text start="1006.839" dur="5.16">was being done on purpose because what</text>
  <text start="1009.209" dur="5.91">their plan was for the future was to</text>
  <text start="1011.999" dur="6.18">have this one-world type of system where</text>
  <text start="1015.119" dur="4.71">all the countries were the same and to</text>
  <text start="1018.179" dur="4.17">bring the United States down to a</text>
  <text start="1019.829" dur="5.161">certain level they had to get rid of a</text>
  <text start="1022.349" dur="4.74">lot of manufacturing and this is what</text>
  <text start="1024.99" dur="4.889">they&amp;#39;ve been in the process of doing now</text>
  <text start="1027.089" dur="4.651">we&amp;#39;re trying to reverse this at the last</text>
  <text start="1029.879" dur="4.111">moment and this is going to be a little</text>
  <text start="1031.74" dur="4.769">difficult and a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1033.99" dur="5.429">understand what is going on because</text>
  <text start="1036.509" dur="4.471">they&amp;#39;ve been you know in the dark all</text>
  <text start="1039.419" dur="3.75">this time they think the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1040.98" dur="3.929">fantastic stock markets going up this</text>
  <text start="1043.169" dur="3.15">will last forever a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1044.909" dur="3.87">thought this in 2008 when they were</text>
  <text start="1046.319" dur="4.23">owning two three four homes they said</text>
  <text start="1048.779" dur="3.6">this party&amp;#39;s never going to end</text>
  <text start="1050.549" dur="3.151">we&amp;#39;re going to hold on to these houses</text>
  <text start="1052.379" dur="2.941">we&amp;#39;re going to become very very wealthy</text>
  <text start="1053.7" dur="3.99">because the housing prices are going to</text>
  <text start="1055.32" dur="3.78">continually move up and up and up a lot</text>
  <text start="1057.69" dur="3.75">of people thought this they thought</text>
  <text start="1059.1" dur="3.99">flipping was never going to end I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1061.44" dur="5.04">never get hurt with this because real</text>
  <text start="1063.09" dur="7.35">estate always goes up everything fell</text>
  <text start="1066.48" dur="4.26">apart the same thing is happening right</text>
  <text start="1070.44" dur="3.15">now</text>
  <text start="1070.74" dur="4.799">the difference is there needs to be a</text>
  <text start="1073.59" dur="4.199">transition because when the system falls</text>
  <text start="1075.539" dur="3.72">apart this time there&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="1077.789" dur="4.02">stimulus that&amp;#39;s going to help the</text>
  <text start="1079.259" dur="4.17">economy the lower interest rates are not</text>
  <text start="1081.809" dur="4.521">going to help because they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="1083.429" dur="5.641">done the damage the real economy is</text>
  <text start="1086.33" dur="4.809">reeling right now and there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="1089.07" dur="3.51">they can do to fix it yeah they can pump</text>
  <text start="1091.139" dur="3.39">the banks up they can pretend the stock</text>
  <text start="1092.58" dur="3.41">market&amp;#39;s up to a hundred thousand points</text>
  <text start="1094.529" dur="4.801">it really is meaningless at the point if</text>
  <text start="1095.99" dur="6.7">the rest of the country can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1099.33" dur="5.789">anything so we all need to be ready we</text>
  <text start="1102.69" dur="6">know the transition is coming and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1105.119" dur="6.39">quietly being done right now it might</text>
  <text start="1108.69" dur="4.829">not be obvious to many people but all of</text>
  <text start="1111.509" dur="3.42">these things need to be done and of</text>
  <text start="1113.519" dur="4.26">course the deep state what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1114.929" dur="4.521">is they&amp;#39;re trying to stop it at every</text>
  <text start="1117.779" dur="4.191">turn they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1119.45" dur="4.229">want this to happen and this is why you</text>
  <text start="1121.97" dur="3.959">see everything this is why you see this</text>
  <text start="1123.679" dur="3.99">battle being fought right in front of us</text>
  <text start="1125.929" dur="4.171">this is why it&amp;#39;s all over the corporate</text>
  <text start="1127.669" dur="4.98">media this is why when Trump tries to do</text>
  <text start="1130.1" dur="4.14">something they try to block him this is</text>
  <text start="1132.649" dur="3.721">why they make it seem like it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="1134.24" dur="5.45">good and I&amp;#39;m not saying that Trump is a</text>
  <text start="1136.37" dur="7.559">savior he is there for a specific reason</text>
  <text start="1139.69" dur="7.42">to transition the entire system into</text>
  <text start="1143.929" dur="5.13">something completely new that is it he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1147.11" dur="4.77">not there to do anything else they</text>
  <text start="1149.059" dur="5.281">already understand how bad the system is</text>
  <text start="1151.88" dur="5.07">think about it we had two choices here</text>
  <text start="1154.34" dur="4.049">they needed an outsider I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="1156.95" dur="4.56">people think that he&amp;#39;s an insider but</text>
  <text start="1158.389" dur="4.861">there&amp;#39;s no way that he is an insider at</text>
  <text start="1161.51" dur="4.56">all they wouldn&amp;#39;t be fighting him this</text>
  <text start="1163.25" dur="5.789">much it wouldn&amp;#39;t be necessary did they</text>
  <text start="1166.07" dur="7.459">fight Obama did they fight Bush did they</text>
  <text start="1169.039" dur="8.311">fight Clinton no I mean if Clinton was</text>
  <text start="1173.529" dur="6.88">elected we being more right now TPP</text>
  <text start="1177.35" dur="6.919">would be passed the entire system would</text>
  <text start="1180.409" dur="7.801">be a nightmare and we would be a</text>
  <text start="1184.269" dur="7.78">third-world country we&amp;#39;d be in war and</text>
  <text start="1188.21" dur="7.11">when we come out of war the whole system</text>
  <text start="1192.049" dur="4.951">would be nothing that we would want the</text>
  <text start="1195.32" dur="5.359">manufacturing that they actually brought</text>
  <text start="1197" dur="5.61">back here under the TPP well other</text>
  <text start="1200.679" dur="3.191">individuals from other countries would</text>
  <text start="1202.61" dur="3.569">be able to work here in the United</text>
  <text start="1203.87" dur="5.01">States at the rate of pay that they were</text>
  <text start="1206.179" dur="4.291">being paid in their country so the</text>
  <text start="1208.88" dur="3.899">American worker would have to compete</text>
  <text start="1210.47" dur="5.64">with those workers which would be</text>
  <text start="1212.779" dur="5.64">completely impossible and we see that</text>
  <text start="1216.11" dur="6.15">that plan that wouldn&amp;#39;t have worked out</text>
  <text start="1218.419" dur="5.22">well for everyone here in America it</text>
  <text start="1222.26" dur="3.36">would have worked out well for the elite</text>
  <text start="1223.639" dur="3.571">it would have worked it well out for the</text>
  <text start="1225.62" dur="4.439">central bankers it would have worked</text>
  <text start="1227.21" dur="5.699">well for their plan so they brought</text>
  <text start="1230.059" dur="4.98">Trump in they needed him he understands</text>
  <text start="1232.909" dur="4.051">bankruptcy he understands restructuring</text>
  <text start="1235.039" dur="4.5">he understands transition he&amp;#39;s a</text>
