  <text start="72.11" dur="5.7">political and geopolitical news now we</text>
  <text start="75.08" dur="5.64">can see that the deep state they are</text>
  <text start="77.81" dur="5.129">doing whatever they possibly can to push</text>
  <text start="80.72" dur="4.14">their agenda they&amp;#39;re back into a corner</text>
  <text start="82.939" dur="4.561">and they do believe they have the upper</text>
  <text start="84.86" dur="4.619">hand where they&amp;#39;re gonna be able to get</text>
  <text start="87.5" dur="5.28">all these people like Paul mana fort</text>
  <text start="89.479" dur="6.121">Flynn and the rest and Muller right now</text>
  <text start="92.78" dur="4.259">he&amp;#39;s really off the path of Russian</text>
  <text start="95.6" dur="3.57">collusion actually he&amp;#39;s not even looking</text>
  <text start="97.039" dur="4.11">at Russian collusion anymore he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="99.17" dur="4.289">after everything else but Russian</text>
  <text start="101.149" dur="3.36">collusion and former Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="103.459" dur="3.061">manager Paul Manafort</text>
  <text start="104.509" dur="3.81">well he filed a motion with a court in</text>
  <text start="106.52" dur="4.889">Virginia to throw out the charges levied</text>
  <text start="108.319" dur="5.701">by special counsel Robert Mueller manna</text>
  <text start="111.409" dur="4.951">fort was charged with litany of formal</text>
  <text start="114.02" dur="5.31">accusations last fall that are primarily</text>
  <text start="116.36" dur="5.369">primarily related to mana forts allege</text>
  <text start="119.33" dur="4.739">efforts to submit false tax returns</text>

  <text start="127.729" dur="4.831">motion filed by manna fort and his legal</text>
  <text start="129.769" dur="5.521">team on Tuesday argues that the crimes</text>
  <text start="132.56" dur="4.709">mana for allegedly committed are invalid</text>
  <text start="135.29" dur="3.9">because they are they had essentially</text>
  <text start="137.269" dur="3.841">nothing to do with Trump colluding with</text>
  <text start="139.19" dur="4.32">the Russians which is what the Justice</text>
  <text start="141.11" dur="5.159">Department tasked the Special Counsel to</text>
  <text start="143.51" dur="5.19">investigate now unlike the old</text>
  <text start="146.269" dur="4.741">Independent Counsel system the Special</text>
  <text start="148.7" dur="5.28">Counsel regulations do not permit a</text>
  <text start="151.01" dur="6.089">special counsels jurisdiction to be wide</text>
  <text start="153.98" dur="4.92">in perimeter and fuzzy at the borders</text>
  <text start="157.099" dur="4.411">and this is what his attorneys are</text>
  <text start="158.9" dur="5.4">saying and this is their argument saying</text>
  <text start="161.51" dur="4.41">this was not part of his mandate to</text>
  <text start="164.3" dur="2.7">start looking into all these things and</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="3.75">this is what&amp;#39;s happening with Trump</text>
  <text start="167" dur="5.599">right now Mueller is no longer looking</text>
  <text start="169.67" dur="6.959">at Russian collusion he&amp;#39;s looking into</text>
  <text start="172.599" dur="6.28">Trump&amp;#39;s finances and we know there was</text>
  <text start="176.629" dur="5.071">an interview with stormy Daniels on 60</text>
  <text start="178.879" dur="5.791">minutes and this is not about him having</text>
  <text start="181.7" dur="4.59">sex with her this is about the payment</text>
  <text start="184.67" dur="3.78">of 130</text>
  <text start="186.29" dur="5.039">thousand dollars where they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="188.45" dur="7.47">get Trump where he didn&amp;#39;t disclose this</text>
  <text start="191.329" dur="6.03">in his election campaign and this is</text>
  <text start="195.92" dur="3.239">what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="197.359" dur="3.841">been trying to build this up with stormy</text>
  <text start="199.159" dur="4.321">Daniels let everyone know who she is</text>
  <text start="201.2" dur="3.989">what has happened and now they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="3.27">be bringing in the payment part of it</text>
  <text start="205.189" dur="3.901">and this is what they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="206.75" dur="4.26">get Trump on and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="4.649">there&amp;#39;s going to be other information</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="5.36">that&amp;#39;s going to be coming out of where</text>
  <text start="213.739" dur="6.301">this payment really originated from and</text>
  <text start="216.37" dur="6.67">why it was paid to her and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="220.04" dur="6.72">basically stop the deep state in their</text>
  <text start="223.04" dur="5.91">tracks we see right now Ron Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="226.76" dur="5.069">has officially been subpoenaed to appear</text>
  <text start="228.95" dur="7.56">before the committee of the judiciary on</text>
  <text start="231.829" dur="7.05">April 5th 2018 so we can see at this</text>
  <text start="236.51" dur="6.649">point all of a sudden things are</text>
  <text start="238.879" dur="8.431">starting to move now Q has told us that</text>
  <text start="243.159" dur="7.601">Facebook Twitter YouTube Google the rest</text>
  <text start="247.31" dur="6.299">are going to be looked at the FTC is</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="6.409">going to be investigating these social</text>
  <text start="253.609" dur="7.38">media platforms and this had to do with</text>
  <text start="257.169" dur="6.731">mining personal data selling personal</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="5.971">data and then eventually moving towards</text>
  <text start="263.9" dur="5.639">regulation maybe I bored the internet</text>
  <text start="266.96" dur="4.44">Bill of Rights to control these social</text>
  <text start="269.539" dur="4.531">media giants or maybe even break them up</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="4.829">and Q has also said that a lot of these</text>
  <text start="274.07" dur="4.379">will not survive we know that Zuckerberg</text>
  <text start="276.229" dur="6.841">has been selling off a lot of his stocks</text>
  <text start="278.449" dur="7.621">and basically he sees the writing on the</text>
  <text start="283.07" dur="5.76">wall maybe they&amp;#39;re using Facebook as the</text>
  <text start="286.07" dur="5.37">sacrificial lamb to show that yeah will</text>
  <text start="288.83" dur="4.86">conform to regulations we don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="291.44" dur="5.43">what happens as long as we can keep</text>
  <text start="293.69" dur="6.3">control of Google and the rest it makes</text>
  <text start="296.87" dur="6.109">no difference to us now the CEO</text>
  <text start="299.99" dur="6.209">Zuckerberg he will not testify to UK</text>
  <text start="302.979" dur="6.16">parliamentary committee he will which</text>
  <text start="306.199" dur="5.641">she says he will testify in front of the</text>
  <text start="309.139" dur="4.681">US Congress and we will see how that</text>
  <text start="311.84" dur="5.639">plays out but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="313.82" dur="5.83">about all of this and we can also put to</text>
  <text start="317.479" dur="4.241">all of this a boom for rod Rowe</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="5.519">Steen who has been subpoenaed to appear</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="6.6">before the committee of the judiciary we</text>
  <text start="325.169" dur="6.06">can also say boom to Facebook where the</text>
  <text start="328.32" dur="6.06">FTC is looking into this we can also see</text>
  <text start="331.229" dur="6.75">that Twitter following a report from</text>
  <text start="334.38" dur="5.31">citron research which exposes a major</text>
  <text start="337.979" dur="5.011">potential problem for the social media</text>
  <text start="339.69" dur="6.12">company and this is from citron research</text>
  <text start="342.99" dur="7.049">calm alongside Facebook and Google</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="8.04">Twitter is now being hauled in by Senate</text>
  <text start="350.039" dur="7.731">Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley to a</text>
  <text start="353.85" dur="10.069">hearing on data privacy on April 10th</text>
  <text start="357.77" dur="9.64">now Twitter this year will generate 400</text>
  <text start="363.919" dur="9.491">million dollars just by selling user</text>
  <text start="367.41" dur="8.7">data not advertising in 2017 ad revenue</text>
  <text start="373.41" dur="5.28">declined to 2 point 1 1 billion from</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="6.119">2.25 billion in the prior year while</text>
  <text start="378.69" dur="7.199">data licensing revenue grew to 333</text>
  <text start="382.229" dur="7.141">million from 282 million in the prior</text>
  <text start="385.889" dur="7.051">year so they&amp;#39;re already going towards</text>
  <text start="389.37" dur="5.25">Twitter now looking at what they have</text>
  <text start="392.94" dur="4.68">been doing this is another boom and</text>
  <text start="394.62" dur="6.12">again all these social media companies</text>
  <text start="397.62" dur="6.39">are going to be controlled and regulated</text>
  <text start="400.74" dur="5.04">and most likely hopefully the internet</text>
  <text start="404.01" dur="3.39">Bill of Rights is going to be pushed out</text>
  <text start="405.78" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re saying listen we need to</text>
  <text start="407.4" dur="4.769">implement this and I think what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="410.55" dur="4.83">to happen here with these companies</text>
  <text start="412.169" dur="5.911">they&amp;#39;re going to be exposed exposed on</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="5.849">how the intelligence agencies help them</text>
  <text start="418.08" dur="5.309">create a lot of their algorithms how the</text>
  <text start="421.229" dur="4.951">intelligence agencies are intertwined</text>
  <text start="423.389" dur="6.481">within these organizations how they were</text>
  <text start="426.18" dur="7.44">being used to silence certain groups and</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="6.479">allow others to speak freely and I think</text>
  <text start="433.62" dur="6.299">all of this is coming out now this is</text>
  <text start="436.349" dur="7.231">what the deep state is afraid of a free</text>
  <text start="439.919" dur="6.421">and open platform they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="443.58" dur="4.829">they don&amp;#39;t like the Constitution where</text>
  <text start="446.34" dur="4.799">people have the right to speak freely</text>
  <text start="448.409" dur="5.191">this is look look what they do to social</text>
  <text start="451.139" dur="5.851">media if you say something they</text>
  <text start="453.6" dur="7.02">just shut it down you can tell just from</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="6.27">this of what they would do if they were</text>
  <text start="460.62" dur="5.79">able to get rid of the Bill of Rights</text>
  <text start="463.26" dur="5.67">here in the u.s. they would take people</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="6.36">away this is why they want to take</text>
  <text start="468.93" dur="6.29">weapons away from the people this is why</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="5.34">there&amp;#39;s been such a push for gun control</text>
  <text start="475.22" dur="4.75">now let&amp;#39;s step back for a second we have</text>
  <text start="478.11" dur="3.66">two different worlds here we have the</text>
  <text start="479.97" dur="5.37">social media world where they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="481.77" dur="6.69">control they can silence people just by</text>
  <text start="485.34" dur="6.63">clicking a button you ask questions you</text>
  <text start="488.46" dur="5.94">show different proof you show different</text>
  <text start="491.97" dur="6.12">information than the establishment click</text>
  <text start="494.4" dur="5.19">you&amp;#39;re gone you&amp;#39;re silenced we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="498.09" dur="3.15">have to hear from you there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="499.59" dur="4.56">internet Bill of Rights you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="501.24" dur="7.38">the freedom to speak freely so they can</text>
  <text start="504.15" dur="7.17">control who is seen who is not seen take</text>
  <text start="508.62" dur="5.7">this a step further if they are doing</text>
  <text start="511.32" dur="5.64">this and so on social media they would</text>
  <text start="514.32" dur="5.99">like to do this with everyone in the</text>
  <text start="516.96" dur="5.87">public but there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="520.31" dur="4.96">people have weapons people would notice</text>
  <text start="522.83" dur="4.72">what is going on here and before they</text>
  <text start="525.27" dur="4.53">can do that they need to move remove the</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="3.57">weapons from the people because the</text>
  <text start="529.8" dur="3.54">people will not stand for this because</text>
  <text start="531.12" dur="5.64">we have the right to speak freely if you</text>
  <text start="533.34" dur="6.36">remove the weapons from the people with</text>
  <text start="536.76" dur="6.15">a push of a button click that person is</text>
  <text start="539.7" dur="5.16">taken away that person who&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="542.91" dur="5.85">speak out maybe on a corner in the city</text>
  <text start="544.86" dur="7.02">or anywhere else is taken away you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="548.76" dur="6.09">fight back you don&amp;#39;t have a weapon the</text>
  <text start="551.88" dur="5.37">people don&amp;#39;t have a weapon to fight for</text>
  <text start="554.85" dur="4.74">their freedom yes you can scream that</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="3.96">you have these rights just like the</text>
  <text start="559.59" dur="2.97">people on YouTube just like the people</text>
  <text start="561.21" dur="4.65">on Facebook just like the people on</text>
  <text start="562.56" dur="6.24">Twitter but guess what they flip a</text>
  <text start="565.86" dur="6.84">button they push a button and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="568.8" dur="6.39">silenced the same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="572.7" dur="5.52">happen once they get all the weapons you</text>
  <text start="575.19" dur="6.27">can see their actions you can see what</text>
  <text start="578.22" dur="4.68">they really want to do this is not you</text>
  <text start="581.46" dur="3.27">know something that&amp;#39;s just out there</text>
  <text start="582.9" dur="4.54">saying oh this could happen they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="584.73" dur="5.98">already started it they&amp;#39;ve already been</text>
  <text start="587.44" dur="5.37">trying to do this and this is why</text>
  <text start="590.71" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s been such a push to remove the</text>
  <text start="592.81" dur="3.54">weapons from the people if you go back</text>
  <text start="594.58" dur="4.17">in time and you look at how many mass</text>
  <text start="596.35" dur="6.11">shootings there were under Obama</text>
  <text start="598.75" dur="8.55">there was a reason the UN arms treaty</text>
  <text start="602.46" dur="7.72">was signed by John Kerry was sitting</text>
  <text start="607.3" dur="6.75">there waiting for some type of an event</text>
  <text start="610.18" dur="6.33">so the Senate would come in vote on it</text>
  <text start="614.05" dur="5.03">and hopefully pass it they tried every</text>
  <text start="616.51" dur="5.58">single time and it didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="619.08" dur="6.64">because this in their minds would give</text>
  <text start="622.09" dur="5.88">our rights to the UN this is what they</text>
  <text start="625.72" dur="3.33">want and the UN could come down and say</text>
  <text start="627.97" dur="3.93">okay everyone doesn&amp;#39;t have a weapon</text>
  <text start="629.05" dur="4.77">everyone has to be fingerprinted you</text>
  <text start="631.9" dur="4.11">needed a code to operate a weapon you</text>
  <text start="633.82" dur="4.53">kit you can&amp;#39;t do anything and all these</text>
  <text start="636.01" dur="5.97">other weapons all these ar-15s and</text>
  <text start="638.35" dur="5.31">everything those are gone this is what</text>
  <text start="641.98" dur="4.35">they were trying to do</text>
  <text start="643.66" dur="5.28">all throughout Obama&amp;#39;s presidency this</text>
  <text start="646.33" dur="6.42">is why the mass shooting percentage went</text>
  <text start="648.94" dur="5.73">up dramatically because every single</text>
  <text start="652.75" dur="4.74">time they tried to do the same thing</text>
  <text start="654.67" dur="7.07">they tried to push the legislation it</text>
  <text start="657.49" dur="6.99">didn&amp;#39;t work and here we are today and</text>
  <text start="661.74" dur="6.4">basically what Q is saying that these</text>
  <text start="664.48" dur="5.76">platforms need to be regulated they we</text>
  <text start="668.14" dur="4.68">need the internet Bill of Rights to give</text>
  <text start="670.24" dur="6.99">everyone the freedom to say whatever</text>
  <text start="672.82" dur="7.71">they want to say even if it counters the</text>
  <text start="677.23" dur="5.25">establishment and yes we do have the</text>
  <text start="680.53" dur="4.17">bill of rights today but these again are</text>
  <text start="682.48" dur="3.93">private companies this is why we need</text>
  <text start="684.7" dur="3.63">the internet Bill of Rights because a</text>
  <text start="686.41" dur="4.56">lot of people use social media today and</text>
  <text start="688.33" dur="5.1">it gives the people the right to say</text>
  <text start="690.97" dur="4.17">what they need to say on the social</text>
  <text start="693.43" dur="5.4">media platforms because it is open to</text>
  <text start="695.14" dur="5.91">the public today it is open and you know</text>
  <text start="698.83" dur="5.37">and anyone can use it but when you start</text>
  <text start="701.05" dur="5.789">censoring certain groups well we have a</text>
  <text start="704.2" dur="4.68">problem and I&amp;#39;m not saying to censor</text>
  <text start="706.839" dur="6">anyone I&amp;#39;m saying there should be open</text>
  <text start="708.88" dur="6.57">to everyone to speak freely we see the</text>

  <text start="742.379" dur="5.041">elections were on the up-and-up and I</text>
  <text start="744.36" dur="6.06">wonder if this is the direction that the</text>
  <text start="747.42" dur="6.899">u.s. is eventually going to go in once</text>
  <text start="750.42" dur="6.06">the election report does come out we see</text>
  <text start="754.319" dur="4.14">the UK government has issued warrants</text>
  <text start="756.48" dur="5.039">for seizure of Russian capital and</text>
  <text start="758.459" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re not just you know expelling the</text>
  <text start="761.519" dur="7.591">Russian diplomats they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="763.709" dur="6.12">their assets and we see that the world</text>
  <text start="769.11" dur="3">right now</text>
  <text start="769.829" dur="5.51">without any proof without any</text>
  <text start="772.11" dur="6.029">investigation without any evidence is</text>
  <text start="775.339" dur="7.031">expelling Russian diplomats except for</text>
  <text start="778.139" dur="7.711">Greece Austria Portugal China and other</text>
  <text start="782.37" dur="7.68">countries they decided not to do this</text>
  <text start="785.85" dur="5.849">they decided they won&amp;#39;t but the EU</text>
  <text start="790.05" dur="4.349">countries like France Germany Poland</text>
  <text start="791.699" dur="6.63">Lithuania Denmark Netherlands Italy</text>
  <text start="794.399" dur="6.63">Spain and the rest they decided yes we</text>
  <text start="798.329" dur="4.38">will follow suit yes Ukraine is included</text>
  <text start="801.029" dur="4.321">in this Canada is included in this</text>
  <text start="802.709" dur="5.101">Australia is included in this Norway&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="805.35" dur="5.789">include included in this and we see</text>
  <text start="807.81" dur="5.879">right now they all climbed aboard no one</text>
  <text start="811.139" dur="5.971">is asking for any evidence no one is</text>
  <text start="813.689" dur="5.971">asking for an investigation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="817.11" dur="4.289">basically not following international</text>
  <text start="819.66" dur="6.299">law they&amp;#39;re not giving any of the</text>
  <text start="821.399" dur="7.771">evidence to Russia this is a hit job to</text>
  <text start="825.959" dur="5.341">push Russia to the edge what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="829.17" dur="5.07">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to start</text>
  <text start="831.3" dur="5.729">a war and I do believe that Trump right</text>
  <text start="834.24" dur="5.219">now went along with this again he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="837.029" dur="4.86">using the strategy of keeping the</text>
  <text start="839.459" dur="4.86">corporate media away from what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="841.889" dur="6.18">really trying to do expelling a couple</text>
  <text start="844.319" dur="6.181">diplomats throughout this is not going</text>
  <text start="848.069" dur="5.831">to be a big deal right now actually it</text>
  <text start="850.5" dur="5.65">shows what countries are still within</text>
  <text start="853.9" dur="3.9">deep state because other countries are</text>
  <text start="856.15" dur="3.87">saying no wait you know something we we</text>
  <text start="857.8" dur="4.86">need some type of evidence we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="860.02" dur="5.76">to expel Russia we don&amp;#39;t want to do this</text>
  <text start="862.66" dur="4.56">you know show us something here the</text>
  <text start="865.78" dur="3.63">other country is like okay we&amp;#39;ll just go</text>
  <text start="867.22" dur="5.61">along with it which is come to me is</text>
  <text start="869.41" dur="6.78">unbelievable now we see that Germany has</text>
  <text start="872.83" dur="6.36">issued a permit for the construction and</text>
  <text start="876.19" dur="5.88">operation of an offshore section of the</text>
  <text start="879.19" dur="5.25">Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the exclusive</text>
  <text start="882.07" dur="4.89">economic zone of Germany in the Baltic</text>
  <text start="884.44" dur="5.13">Sea which means that they&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="886.96" dur="3.99">ahead with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline</text>
  <text start="889.57" dur="4.44">this is something the u.s. the deep</text>
  <text start="890.95" dur="5.04">state has been trying to stop and we see</text>
  <text start="894.01" dur="5.19">the authorisation from regulators in</text>
  <text start="895.99" dur="5.16">Russia Finland Sweden Denmark through</text>
  <text start="899.2" dur="4.32">territories of which the pipeline is set</text>
  <text start="901.15" dur="4.89">to run as well are due to be obtained in</text>
  <text start="903.52" dur="5.31">the coming months and the scheduled</text>
  <text start="906.04" dur="4.14">construction will be carried out this</text>
  <text start="908.83" dur="4.14">year as planned</text>
  <text start="910.18" dur="6.42">so we see right now everything is being</text>
  <text start="912.97" dur="5.84">moved forward Germany is working with</text>
  <text start="916.6" dur="6">Russia they&amp;#39;re going to be getting gas</text>
  <text start="918.81" dur="6.13">from Russia into Europe and the whole</text>
  <text start="922.6" dur="5.88">thing that the deep state tried to do to</text>
  <text start="924.94" dur="6.39">stop this has not worked we see Russia</text>
  <text start="928.48" dur="6.95">right now they are out there trying to</text>
  <text start="931.33" dur="7.83">get Afghanistan the u.s. the Taliban</text>
  <text start="935.43" dur="7">together to talk about peace and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="939.16" dur="6">hoping to get the u.s. involved in this</text>
  <text start="942.43" dur="4.35">just like they were getting the u.s.</text>
  <text start="945.16" dur="3.63">involved in the peace talks with North</text>
  <text start="946.78" dur="4.86">Korea and we could see right now that</text>
  <text start="948.79" dur="5.01">all of this is about peace now I know</text>
  <text start="951.64" dur="4.53">the corporate media and certain</text>
  <text start="953.8" dur="4.2">alternative media stations channels are</text>
  <text start="956.17" dur="5.28">out there saying that Trump is putting</text>
  <text start="958" dur="5.43">together a war cabinet no way is he</text>
  <text start="961.45" dur="3.39">putting together a war cabinet it makes</text>
  <text start="963.43" dur="3.96">no sense if he really wanted to go to</text>
  <text start="964.84" dur="6.3">war he had so many opportunities</text>
  <text start="967.39" dur="4.98">he fired missiles into Syria why didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="971.14" dur="3">we go to war that was the perfect</text>
  <text start="972.37" dur="4.44">opportunity could have brought the</text>
  <text start="974.14" dur="6.29">troops right in went up against Russia</text>
  <text start="976.81" dur="6.21">could have had a war didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="980.43" dur="5.38">instead we&amp;#39;re gonna be removing the</text>
  <text start="983.02" dur="4.24">soldiers from Syria actually the funding</text>
  <text start="985.81" dur="3.52">was cut off from the mod</text>
  <text start="987.26" dur="5.09">Remmel the paid mercenaries the funding</text>
  <text start="989.33" dur="6.81">was cut off from the Kurds deliveries of</text>
  <text start="992.35" dur="6.04">US assets military assets was being is</text>
  <text start="996.14" dur="4.55">being cut off all of its being cut off</text>
  <text start="998.39" dur="4.62">we could have had a war with North Korea</text>
  <text start="1000.69" dur="4.24">everyone was telling us how plans were</text>
  <text start="1003.01" dur="3.81">being drawn up this is what the losses</text>
  <text start="1004.93" dur="5.07">were gonna be like instead behind the</text>
  <text start="1006.82" dur="5.19">scenes peace was being discussed here we</text>
  <text start="1010" dur="5.25">are headed towards Iran yes Bolton is</text>
  <text start="1012.01" dur="6.3">now in that position it&amp;#39;s to keep an eye</text>
  <text start="1015.25" dur="6.18">on him to see how the neocons operate to</text>
  <text start="1018.31" dur="5.64">see what they are up to are we going to</text>
  <text start="1021.43" dur="6">war with Iran why would we go to a war</text>
  <text start="1023.95" dur="5.129">with Iran right now Russia China backs</text>
  <text start="1027.43" dur="3.6">Iran that means we would go to war with</text>
  <text start="1029.079" dur="3.691">Russia and China what we have we had an</text>
  <text start="1031.03" dur="4.29">opportunity with Syria we had an</text>
  <text start="1032.77" dur="4.11">opportunity with North Korea why would</text>
  <text start="1035.32" dur="4.65">we go to war with Iran right now makes</text>
  <text start="1036.88" dur="4.74">no sense why wait all this time we had</text>
  <text start="1039.97" dur="3.69">perfect opportunities go to war</text>
  <text start="1041.62" dur="4.65">this is not about war this is not a war</text>
  <text start="1043.66" dur="6.39">cabinet this is keeping your enemies</text>
  <text start="1046.27" dur="6.45">very close to study them to watch what</text>
  <text start="1050.05" dur="6.45">they do and then eventually to get rid</text>
  <text start="1052.72" dur="6.54">of them which he will eventually do so</text>
  <text start="1056.5" dur="6.72">basically this is not about war this is</text>
  <text start="1059.26" dur="8.13">about removing the deep state removing</text>
  <text start="1063.22" dur="7.5">the neocons one individual at a time the</text>
  <text start="1067.39" dur="5.49">plan is basically happening right in</text>
  <text start="1070.72" dur="4.95">front of us we can see it all unfolding</text>
  <text start="1072.88" dur="5.94">right now is it at the speed that</text>
  <text start="1075.67" dur="4.38">everyone wants of course not this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1078.82" dur="2.87">that something you can just go in there</text>
  <text start="1080.05" dur="5.03">and just change with a snap of a finger</text>
  <text start="1081.69" dur="7.24">this is a deep state which is very deep</text>
  <text start="1085.08" dur="7.06">this is a central banking system which</text>
  <text start="1088.93" dur="6.3">has their tentacles in almost everything</text>
  <text start="1092.14" dur="7.74">and they&amp;#39;ve been running the system for</text>
  <text start="1095.23" dur="7.23">a very long time Trump the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="1099.88" dur="4.05">still have a lot of work to do and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1102.46" dur="4.29">trying to do this in a very short period</text>
  <text start="1103.93" dur="5.31">of time yes he could have fired all the</text>
  <text start="1106.75" dur="4.95">mouthpieces he could have fired all the</text>
  <text start="1109.24" dur="4.5">surface individuals but that wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1111.7" dur="3.72">have stopped the deep state because the</text>
  <text start="1113.74" dur="3.89">deep state are the people behind the</text>
  <text start="1115.42" dur="5.16">scenes behind the curtain the unelected</text>
  <text start="1117.63" dur="5.049">individuals</text>
  <text start="1120.58" dur="3.9">and this is where you need to get to you</text>
  <text start="1122.679" dur="4.441">need to get to the source you need to</text>
  <text start="1124.48" dur="6.299">get to that point where you can say I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1127.12" dur="7.049">cut the source off from the rest and</text>
  <text start="1130.779" dur="5.541">guess what the all the tentacles</text>
  <text start="1134.169" dur="4.38">everything else they just die off</text>
  <text start="1136.32" dur="4.18">because once they lose their funding</text>
  <text start="1138.549" dur="4.771">just like the Islamic state it&amp;#39;s game</text>
  <text start="1140.5" dur="5.549">over we see right now there&amp;#39;s footage</text>
  <text start="1143.32" dur="4.65">that has been released in Syria where</text>
  <text start="1146.049" dur="5.1">there was a secret underground tunnel</text>
  <text start="1147.97" dur="5.64">and make makeshift field hospitals that</text>
  <text start="1151.149" dur="5.311">were used by the paid mercenaries in</text>
  <text start="1153.61" dur="4.23">Syria so they dug underground they were</text>
  <text start="1156.46" dur="3.599">able to move back and forth they had</text>
  <text start="1157.84" dur="3.6">hospitals they kept military assets</text>
  <text start="1160.059" dur="4.171">rockets bombs</text>
  <text start="1161.44" dur="7.219">you name it they had it underground it</text>
  <text start="1164.23" dur="7.919">was all built to keep the war going and</text>
  <text start="1168.659" dur="7.181">we see right now that it is pretty much</text>
  <text start="1172.149" dur="7.081">over and done with in Syria the deep</text>
  <text start="1175.84" dur="5.64">state tried many many times to get that</text>
  <text start="1179.23" dur="2.73">chemical attack false flag off the</text>
  <text start="1181.48" dur="3.84">ground</text>
  <text start="1181.96" dur="5.939">it failed Russia intercepted they found</text>
  <text start="1185.32" dur="5.069">the chemical weapons they just couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1187.899" dur="4.051">get it to work they couldn&amp;#39;t push the</text>
  <text start="1190.389" dur="3.51">false flag it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="1191.95" dur="3.78">harder out in the Middle East to do</text>
  <text start="1193.899" dur="3.721">these things and I believe it&amp;#39;s game</text>
  <text start="1195.73" dur="4.14">over for the deep state out there unless</text>
  <text start="1197.62" dur="4.38">they do something very very big but I</text>
  <text start="1199.87" dur="3.689">see right now the deep state they are</text>
  <text start="1202" dur="4.169">regrouping we&amp;#39;re seeing a dead cat</text>
  <text start="1203.559" dur="4.921">bounce right now they are pushing their</text>
  <text start="1206.169" dur="5.01">agenda and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if we</text>
  <text start="1208.48" dur="5.25">see something else happen to really push</text>
  <text start="1211.179" dur="5.941">their agenda forward and we can see at</text>
  <text start="1213.73" dur="6.21">this time that Trump is with the</text>
  <text start="1217.12" dur="5.61">Patriots are pushing their plan to take</text>
  <text start="1219.94" dur="6.18">control of the system so we have both of</text>
  <text start="1222.73" dur="6.63">these factions moving forward trying to</text>
  <text start="1226.12" dur="5.64">control the narrative trying to gain</text>
  <text start="1229.36" dur="4.199">control of the system and I do believe</text>
  <text start="1231.76" dur="4.59">the deep state they&amp;#39;re backed into a</text>
  <text start="1233.559" dur="5.041">corner they&amp;#39;re gonna have no place to go</text>
  <text start="1236.35" dur="4.53">and it&amp;#39;s going to get harder and harder</text>
  <text start="1238.6" dur="4.14">for them to push their agenda because</text>
  <text start="1240.88" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re really they have nothing left</text>
  <text start="1242.74" dur="6.439">except maybe an event they might push an</text>
  <text start="1247.21" dur="4.98">event they still have that opportunity</text>
  <text start="1249.179" dur="5.201">remember the last event that is dying</text>
  <text start="1252.19" dur="4.2">off right now the march was held</text>
  <text start="1254.38" dur="4.41">and now they have pretty much nothing</text>
  <text start="1256.39" dur="4.65">else so it looks like if they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1258.79" dur="5.19">to do something we&amp;#39;re going to see maybe</text>
  <text start="1261.04" dur="5.88">another event and if they do have the</text>
  <text start="1263.98" dur="6.39">ability to do this we will see this</text>
  <text start="1266.92" dur="5.01">event and we will see them try to push</text>
  <text start="1270.37" dur="3.18">their agenda once again</text>
