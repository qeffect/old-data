  <text start="124.539" dur="6.931">has a specific reason there are no</text>
  <text start="128.32" dur="7.11">coincidences and we know from queuing</text>
  <text start="131.47" dur="7.14">the post that the people follow the</text>
  <text start="135.43" dur="7.08">Stars and I do believe this college</text>
  <text start="138.61" dur="7.86">emission scandal is something they were</text>
  <text start="142.51" dur="6.75">working on investigating to produce to</text>
  <text start="146.47" dur="6.3">the public that look these people that</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="5.4">you see they&amp;#39;re playing characters this</text>
  <text start="152.77" dur="4.08">is what they&amp;#39;re really like and I think</text>
  <text start="154.66" dur="6.09">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do here is to</text>
  <text start="156.85" dur="6.03">break the brainwashing of people</text>
  <text start="160.75" dur="4.98">thinking that oh if a</text>
  <text start="162.88" dur="5.1">movie star or a TV star says it then it</text>
  <text start="165.73" dur="3.12">must be right and true and we must</text>
  <text start="167.98" dur="4.65">believe them</text>
  <text start="168.85" dur="8.82">and I believe this is why this came out</text>
  <text start="172.63" dur="7.89">this whole entire story of TV and CEOs</text>
  <text start="177.67" dur="4.62">and others where they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="180.52" dur="4.56">corrupt and it looks like the mainstream</text>
  <text start="182.29" dur="4.53">media you know they&amp;#39;re trying to spin</text>
  <text start="185.08" dur="4.38">this and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="186.82" dur="4.71">what is going on and they say things</text>
  <text start="189.46" dur="4.53">like after all she seems like such a</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="5.3">nice lady on television well remember</text>
  <text start="193.99" dur="5.42">their characters they&amp;#39;re playing a role</text>
  <text start="196.83" dur="5.77">this is not who they really are</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="6.82">but I think this was done on purpose we</text>
  <text start="202.6" dur="6.54">also see with Jesse Smollett he was</text>
  <text start="206.23" dur="5.1">indicted on 16 counts of felony</text>
  <text start="209.14" dur="4.98">disorderly conduct he&amp;#39;s pleading not</text>
  <text start="211.33" dur="4.56">guilty but something very interesting</text>
  <text start="214.12" dur="3.99">about this whole story first of all it</text>
  <text start="215.89" dur="4.83">was shown to be a hoax</text>
  <text start="218.11" dur="4.97">so people understood that yeah look</text>
  <text start="220.72" dur="4.92">Trump supporters are not attacking</text>
  <text start="223.08" dur="6.7">people of color or anything like that</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="6.93">this was made up and I believe the</text>
  <text start="229.78" dur="6.18">police were pointed in the right</text>
  <text start="232.57" dur="7.56">direction to figure all of this out but</text>
  <text start="235.96" dur="5.87">what came out of this is that former</text>
  <text start="240.13" dur="3.99">First Lady Michelle Obama</text>
  <text start="241.83" dur="4.84">attempted to pull strings for Jesse</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="5.28">Smollett and have the case taken over by</text>
  <text start="246.67" dur="6.69">the FBI only to have the prosecutor she</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="5.809">reached out to recuse herself so when</text>
  <text start="253.36" dur="4.59">the facts were still breaking and</text>
  <text start="255.209" dur="5.771">Smollett was considering the victim of a</text>
  <text start="257.95" dur="4.56">hate crime a former Obama administration</text>
  <text start="260.98" dur="3.93">official attempted to have the case</text>
  <text start="262.51" dur="3.66">redirected from the Chicago Police</text>
  <text start="264.91" dur="4.34">Department to the FBI</text>
  <text start="266.17" dur="6.87">and they did this through text messages</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="5.32">Tina Chen who worked as Obama&amp;#39;s chief of</text>
  <text start="273.04" dur="4.92">staff during her time in the White House</text>
  <text start="274.57" dur="6.63">reached out to Chicago prosecutor Kim</text>
  <text start="277.96" dur="5.34">Fox by text messages in early February</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="4.26">she requested that the Chicago Police</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="4.19">hand over the case to the FBI for them</text>
  <text start="285.46" dur="4.74">to pursue federal hate crime charges</text>
  <text start="287.49" dur="6.07">when she received a positive response</text>
  <text start="290.2" dur="5.49">from Fox Chen then relayed the</text>
  <text start="293.56" dur="3.06">information to one of smollett relatives</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="3.84">who said the</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="7.26">would be a victory for the family but</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="7.05">guess what it didn&amp;#39;t work out and that</text>
  <text start="303.88" dur="5.67">didn&amp;#39;t happen so I remember all these</text>
  <text start="306.58" dur="5.339">calls coming in and it seems like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="3.869">starting to figure out where all this</text>
  <text start="311.919" dur="5.22">information and what has been happening</text>
  <text start="313.419" dur="6.111">and who did this in this case so now</text>
  <text start="317.139" dur="5.611">it&amp;#39;s starting to make sense we see that</text>
  <text start="319.53" dur="6.01">Trump is continually making the push</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="5.1">dropping carpet bombs to wake the people</text>
  <text start="325.54" dur="4.439">up he said the following in tweet</text>

  <text start="332.47" dur="4.62">those 81 subpoenas it&amp;#39;s ridiculous just</text>
  <text start="335.53" dur="2.759">because you&amp;#39;re still upset over an</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="3.12">election that happened two and a half</text>
  <text start="338.289" dur="6">years ago you should not be allowed to</text>

  <text start="480.92" dur="6.3">possibly can out there to show that</text>
  <text start="483.89" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re gonna get Trump but once again he</text>
  <text start="487.22" dur="6.57">didn&amp;#39;t dangle a pardon</text>
  <text start="488.78" dur="6.72">he completely said no to Cohen he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="493.79" dur="3.51">given a pardon to anybody even though</text>
  <text start="495.5" dur="4.04">they&amp;#39;re trying to say well he made this</text>
  <text start="497.3" dur="5.25">quote from a movie and that means though</text>
  <text start="499.54" dur="5.76">he was quoting a movie to tell him</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="6.56">listen we&amp;#39;re not gonna do anything relax</text>
  <text start="505.3" dur="7.15">again this is not gonna hold up we see</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="6.16">Trump now flips the control of the first</text>
  <text start="512.45" dur="6.45">federal appeals court and it looks like</text>
  <text start="515.27" dur="5.31">the Senate confirmed Judge Paul Matti to</text>
  <text start="518.9" dur="4.8">the US Court of Appeals to the Third</text>

  <text start="523.7" dur="5.43">divided into 13 federal appeals courts</text>
  <text start="526.07" dur="5.43">for example the Third Circuit includes</text>
  <text start="529.13" dur="5.4">Pennsylvania New Jersey Delaware and US</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="6.96">Virgin Islands the Senate confirmed this</text>
  <text start="534.53" dur="6.75">new judge by a vote of 54 to 46 joe</text>
  <text start="538.46" dur="5.49">Manchin was the sole Democrat to join</text>
  <text start="541.28" dur="5.97">all Republicans in supporting this</text>
  <text start="543.95" dur="6.57">nomination so it looks like Trump is on</text>
  <text start="547.25" dur="4.71">his way in filling these seats now</text>
  <text start="550.52" dur="4.17">something very interesting with</text>
  <text start="551.96" dur="6.11">WikiLeaks we know the DNC is suing</text>
  <text start="554.69" dur="7.35">because they&amp;#39;re saying that WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="558.07" dur="5.37">wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to disseminate the emails</text>
  <text start="562.04" dur="3.86">of Clinton</text>
  <text start="563.44" dur="6.06">but we see that something now is</text>
  <text start="565.9" dur="5.7">changing with in this case the night</text>
