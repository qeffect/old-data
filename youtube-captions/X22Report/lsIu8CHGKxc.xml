  <text start="94.509" dur="3.871">know the central banks have been buying</text>
  <text start="96.19" dur="4.56">a lot of the stocks because they needed</text>
  <text start="98.38" dur="5.31">to pump up the stock market we know that</text>
  <text start="100.75" dur="5.7">the banks were receiving free money from</text>
  <text start="103.69" dur="4.23">the Fed and they were told not to loan</text>
  <text start="106.45" dur="3.72">it out but to put it back into the</text>
  <text start="107.92" dur="4.08">market to pump it up and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="110.17" dur="4.979">seeing right now is that the stock</text>
  <text start="112" dur="6.78">market right now has broke the longest</text>
  <text start="115.149" dur="8.941">streak ever without a 3% correction in</text>

  <text start="146.35" dur="6.419">or more only four times the fewest for a</text>
  <text start="149.35" dur="5.699">full year since 1964 and when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="152.769" dur="4.951">looking at this we can see that you know</text>
  <text start="155.049" dur="5.341">the corporate media the Fed the</text>
  <text start="157.72" dur="4.14">government they&amp;#39;re out there saying hey</text>
  <text start="160.39" dur="4.05">look at the stock market everything is</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="4.32">fine the economy&amp;#39;s fine and this is</text>
  <text start="164.44" dur="4.23">absolutely meaningless because we know</text>
  <text start="166.18" dur="6.99">the fang stocks that whole entire</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="5.61">indicee that is propped up by the</text>
  <text start="173.17" dur="3.409">central banks</text>
  <text start="174.28" dur="4.62">we know that the banks were receiving</text>
  <text start="176.579" dur="4.75">free money from the Fed they were told</text>
  <text start="178.9" dur="5.01">not to loan it out but to put it back</text>
  <text start="181.329" dur="5.331">into the stock market they went to zero</text>
  <text start="183.91" dur="5.3">percent interest rates hoping that</text>
  <text start="186.66" dur="4.26">or retail investors would take their</text>
  <text start="189.21" dur="4.29">money and put it into the stock market</text>
  <text start="190.92" dur="5.64">to get the return and get it out of the</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="6.78">bank and hopefully take the profits and</text>
  <text start="196.56" dur="7.83">go spend it well a lot of this didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="200.28" dur="7.35">happen and right now the only thing the</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="5.61">central banks have well it&amp;#39;s the stock</text>
  <text start="207.63" dur="5.84">market it&amp;#39;s the bond market it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="210" dur="6.33">manipulation of the entire system</text>
  <text start="213.47" dur="5.35">because without manipulating all of this</text>
  <text start="216.33" dur="5.91">they have absolutely nothing the entire</text>
  <text start="218.82" dur="7.05">economy just implodes and once again the</text>
  <text start="222.24" dur="9.42">stock market is not the driver of the</text>
  <text start="225.87" dur="8.58">economy it&amp;#39;s an indicator that is</text>
  <text start="231.66" dur="6.6">controlled by the central bank to fool</text>
  <text start="234.45" dur="8.51">us into thinking the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="6.9">well think about 2008 and before that I</text>
  <text start="242.96" dur="4.96">mean during the time where there was a</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="5.85">housing crisis where Bear Stearns was in</text>
  <text start="247.92" dur="5.82">trouble Lehman was got about to implode</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="5">all the Corporations were saying look</text>
  <text start="253.74" dur="5.67">look at our earnings they&amp;#39;re fantastic</text>
  <text start="256.01" dur="5.62">even though they were all in trouble AIG</text>
  <text start="259.41" dur="4.35">was in trouble and the stock market was</text>
  <text start="261.63" dur="5.09">at like 14,000 points continually moving</text>
  <text start="263.76" dur="5.7">higher and higher the housing market was</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="6.04">completely ripping itself apart that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.46" dur="5.7">the true real economy even though the</text>
  <text start="272.76" dur="6.51">market continually moved up or stayed</text>
  <text start="275.16" dur="5.55">very high that was an illusion to make</text>
  <text start="279.27" dur="3.66">you think that everything was fine until</text>
  <text start="280.71" dur="3.3">the very last moment when the market</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="3.45">came down and everyone started to</text>
  <text start="284.01" dur="5.28">realize well wait a minute them the</text>
  <text start="286.38" dur="5.16">entire system it&amp;#39;s already falling apart</text>
  <text start="289.29" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s not falling apart it is already</text>
  <text start="291.54" dur="7.29">falling apart just like now the entire</text>
  <text start="295.23" dur="5.64">system has already fallen apart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="4.14">already imploding look at retail look at</text>
  <text start="300.87" dur="4.98">housing now look at GDP numbers these</text>
  <text start="302.97" dur="4.92">are my GDP unemployment the rest is</text>
  <text start="305.85" dur="3.6">manipulated numbers but when you look at</text>
  <text start="307.89" dur="3.029">this and you can see that you know</text>
  <text start="309.45" dur="3.5">there&amp;#39;s a lot more strip malls that are</text>
  <text start="310.919" dur="5.671">empty a lot of people looking for jobs</text>
  <text start="312.95" dur="6.31">all of this is showing that the economy</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="3.78">is already imploding we&amp;#39;re just waiting</text>
  <text start="319.26" dur="2.64">for the</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="3.09">red flare to go into the sky to say</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re in a recession and that is when</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="4.23">the stock market Falls it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="325.47" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s when the economy completely</text>
  <text start="327.69" dur="2.97">implodes at that point that just means</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="4.41">yeah</text>
  <text start="330.66" dur="5.85">they lost control the economy is doomed</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="4.29">now Goldman Sachs is out there and</text>
  <text start="336.51" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re looking at all different</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="2.97">indicators and of course they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="339.84" dur="5.22">at the stock market and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="5.55">well this one economic indicator and</text>
  <text start="345.06" dur="4.2">this is according to constant who works</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="5.28">for Goldman Sachs has emerged as a red</text>
  <text start="349.26" dur="5.4">flag of caution now according to Goldman</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="4.8">the most actionable economic indicator</text>
  <text start="354.66" dur="4.319">currently is the manufacturing is M</text>
  <text start="356.91" dur="3.96">which has so far provided the green</text>
  <text start="358.979" dur="5.341">light for stocks to maintain their</text>
  <text start="360.87" dur="5.43">ascent even as hard economic data has</text>
  <text start="364.32" dur="4.05">been anything but stellar in recent</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="3.98">weeks economic growth is the most</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="3.75">important driver of corporate earnings</text>
  <text start="370.28" dur="3.49">remember they didn&amp;#39;t say corporate</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="3.18">revenue of corporate sales corporate</text>
  <text start="373.77" dur="4.11">earnings which could be manipulated and</text>
  <text start="375.3" dur="3.78">equity performance if we really look at</text>
  <text start="377.88" dur="2.909">the corporate revenue in the corporate</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="3.959">sales we can see they&amp;#39;ve been declining</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="5.761">quite a bit these corporations have been</text>
  <text start="383.039" dur="6.241">selling and closing manufacturing plants</text>
  <text start="386.55" dur="6.75">laying off individuals buying back their</text>
  <text start="389.28" dur="5.67">stock to pump up their earnings and what</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re going to see once again is that</text>
  <text start="394.95" dur="2.969">this whole thing is going to come</text>
  <text start="396.96" dur="4.23">crashing down</text>
  <text start="397.919" dur="5.851">now Simon Black is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.19" dur="5.28">saying that this next stock market crash</text>
  <text start="403.77" dur="5.1">will be faster and bigger than ever</text>
  <text start="406.47" dur="4.56">before some of the blame for high</text>
  <text start="408.87" dur="3.78">valuation goes to the so-called Fang</text>
  <text start="411.03" dur="4.02">stocks which is Facebook Amazon Netflix</text>
  <text start="412.65" dur="5.04">and Google whose average p/e is now</text>
  <text start="415.05" dur="4.589">around a hundred and thirty but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.69" dur="5.18">something different about today&amp;#39;s bull</text>
  <text start="419.639" dur="7.411">market if we really look at it</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="6.34">everything is going up at once leading</text>
  <text start="427.05" dur="3.989">up to the tech bubble bursting investors</text>
  <text start="429.21" dur="3.959">would dump defensive stocks thereby</text>
  <text start="431.039" dur="4.861">pushing down their valuations to buy</text>
  <text start="433.169" dur="5.791">high-flying tech stocks like Intel Cisco</text>
  <text start="435.9" dur="6.66">the result was a valuation dispersion</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="5.4">the S&amp;amp;P cap-weighted index which was</text>
  <text start="442.56" dur="5.52">influenced by the high valuations the of</text>

  <text start="478.87" dur="5.97">we say this is not as hyperbole but</text>
  <text start="482.63" dur="4.41">based on quantitative perspective</text>
  <text start="484.84" dur="4.15">dispersions in valuations and growth</text>
  <text start="487.04" dur="5.06">rates are among the lowest in the last</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="6.39">40 years talks are at their most</text>
  <text start="492.1" dur="5.17">idiosyncratic since 2001 so ask yourself</text>
  <text start="495.38" dur="3.84">with stocks trading at some of the</text>
  <text start="497.27" dur="4.77">highest levels in history is now the</text>
  <text start="499.22" dur="5.88">time to be adding more equity risk to</text>
  <text start="502.04" dur="6.42">your portfolio slowing global growth</text>

  <text start="510.86" dur="6.679">China and cyber terrorism well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.88" dur="4.65">just to name a few potential pitfalls</text>
  <text start="517.539" dur="4.93">investors continually</text>
  <text start="519.53" dur="5.81">put money to work without care in the</text>
  <text start="522.469" dur="6.421">world of what&amp;#39;s going on everywhere else</text>
  <text start="525.34" dur="4.99">well this tells you something this tells</text>
  <text start="528.89" dur="3.15">you that it&amp;#39;s just not the retail</text>
  <text start="530.33" dur="3.51">investor that&amp;#39;s pumping this up because</text>
  <text start="532.04" dur="3.42">people would get nervous people would</text>
  <text start="533.84" dur="4.04">say you know something let me take my</text>
  <text start="535.46" dur="5.31">profits now let me get out of the market</text>
  <text start="537.88" dur="6.67">but essential banks they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="540.77" dur="6.57">pumping this up they don&amp;#39;t own all the</text>
  <text start="544.55" dur="5.58">stocks they own quite a bit of it but we</text>
  <text start="547.34" dur="4.83">can see right now that the retail</text>
  <text start="550.13" dur="4.95">investor they&amp;#39;re eventually going to get</text>
  <text start="552.17" dur="4.38">nervous and people are gonna say you</text>
  <text start="555.08" dur="3.45">know something we need to start to sound</text>
  <text start="556.55" dur="6.06">we have to remember the pensions also</text>
  <text start="558.53" dur="6.9">invested in a lot of these investments</text>
  <text start="562.61" dur="4.11">where they&amp;#39;re not getting that 8% return</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re not even getting anything close</text>
  <text start="566.72" dur="4.26">so again people are going to lose their</text>
  <text start="569.06" dur="3.69">pensions during this time period when</text>
  <text start="570.98" dur="4.56">the market comes down people are going</text>
  <text start="572.75" dur="4.65">to learn lose their life savings when</text>
  <text start="575.54" dur="6.21">this market comes down it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="577.4" dur="8.46">a complete and utter disaster now</text>
  <text start="581.75" dur="5.6">through July 27 exchange-traded funds</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="5.18">ETFs took</text>
  <text start="587.35" dur="6.81">record 391 billion surpassing 2016 s</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="5.04">record inflow of 390 billion so all</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="596.08" dur="4.29">pumping this bubble up bigger and bigger</text>
  <text start="599.2" dur="4.35">and bigger</text>
  <text start="600.37" dur="5.34">and if stocks go up for another year</text>
  <text start="603.55" dur="2.49">which they may it&amp;#39;s simply not worth the</text>
  <text start="605.71" dur="2.25">risk</text>
  <text start="606.04" dur="4.77">to chase them higher because the</text>
  <text start="607.96" dur="5.1">downturn when this thing comes down is</text>
  <text start="610.81" dur="4.17">going to be devastating and people say</text>
  <text start="613.06" dur="3.75">well no this is ridiculous you know if</text>
  <text start="614.98" dur="4.47">the central bank keeps purchasing</text>
  <text start="616.81" dur="5.16">everything&amp;#39;s gonna be fine well you have</text>

  <text start="621.97" dur="4.14">thought when the Dow hit a thousand in</text>
  <text start="623.92" dur="4.98">the 70s everything was going to be</text>
  <text start="626.11" dur="6.24">fantastic when everyone thought when the</text>
  <text start="628.9" dur="6.72">Dow hit 10,000 it was going to never end</text>
  <text start="632.35" dur="5.9">when it hit 14,000 in 2008 everyone</text>
  <text start="635.62" dur="7.59">thought wow look at this here we are at</text>
  <text start="638.25" dur="9.49">23,000 do you really think that this is</text>
  <text start="643.21" dur="8.34">gonna go on forever it&amp;#39;s impossible it</text>
  <text start="647.74" dur="6.54">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter because when the</text>
  <text start="651.55" dur="4.74">real economy continually breaks down and</text>
  <text start="654.28" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s a slow processor just not doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="662.38" dur="7.05">and what happens is it starts out very</text>
  <text start="664.72" dur="6.96">slowly we see a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="669.43" dur="4.8">deterioration in retail a little bit in</text>
  <text start="671.68" dur="5.7">housing people really don&amp;#39;t notice it</text>
  <text start="674.23" dur="4.74">they keep purchasing we see that numbers</text>
  <text start="677.38" dur="4.61">are continually manipulated even further</text>
  <text start="678.97" dur="5.55">and further each day and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="681.99" dur="4.12">things start to accelerate a couple</text>
  <text start="684.52" dur="3.18">hundred stores closed down after this</text>
