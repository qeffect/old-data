  <text start="44.879" dur="6.241">reserve currency of the world and they</text>
  <text start="47.82" dur="4.44">are now pushing their agenda forward and</text>
  <text start="51.12" dur="2.97">we&amp;#39;re going to get into that a little</text>
  <text start="52.26" dur="3.66">bit later in this report but let&amp;#39;s get</text>

  <text start="64.53" dur="3.69">corporate media they&amp;#39;re all saying that</text>
  <text start="66.24" dur="4.11">oh yes there is a recovery it looks like</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="5.189">manufacturing could be up unemployment</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="5.1">could be going down but in reality it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="73.409" dur="4.861">completely false it is just that</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="6.3">propaganda Spain right now their</text>

  <text start="88.95" dur="8.029">people out of work and we are seeing</text>
  <text start="92.939" dur="8.881">this run its course all throughout</text>
  <text start="96.979" dur="6.881">Europe every single country things are</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="4.68">not getting better is actually getting</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="5.49">worse and we can tell it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="106.5" dur="5.34">by all the data that is coming out of</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="4.65">all these areas and of course if you</text>
  <text start="111.84" dur="4.05">listen to the corporate media they like</text>
  <text start="114" dur="3.96">to spin this information they like to</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="4.079">take bits and pieces and they tell you</text>
  <text start="117.96" dur="4.409">that things are getting better but again</text>
  <text start="119.969" dur="4.44">it is a complete illusion they told us</text>
  <text start="122.369" dur="5.221">that things were getting better back in</text>
  <text start="124.409" dur="5.611">the summer and the fall of 2013 and here</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="5.09">we are Greece is getting another bail</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="5.43">out Cyprus is getting another bailout</text>
  <text start="132.68" dur="5.58">unemployment continually goes up we are</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="5.28">seeing protests we are seeing rioting</text>
  <text start="138.26" dur="4.479">France they told us they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="140.73" dur="5.25">recovery span they said the same thing</text>
  <text start="142.739" dur="4.521">guess what they are going nowhere the</text>
  <text start="145.98" dur="4.979">only thing they&amp;#39;ve been doing is</text>
  <text start="147.26" dur="6.369">manipulating data using social security</text>
  <text start="150.959" dur="5.371">reserves in Spain to pay off certain</text>
  <text start="153.629" dur="6.271">things France has been raising taxes</text>
  <text start="156.33" dur="5.46">they raise taxes to like 75 percent for</text>
  <text start="159.9" dur="3.899">those who are very wealthy and of course</text>
  <text start="161.79" dur="3.69">those are going to come down to the</text>
  <text start="163.799" dur="3.601">middle class and down to the poor</text>
  <text start="165.48" dur="4.679">because this is always how it happens</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="5.46">because they do not have the revenue to</text>
  <text start="170.159" dur="4.741">pay for everything now here in the US we</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="4.79">are seeing the same exact thing but</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="6.479">again all eyes on the stock market and</text>
  <text start="177.65" dur="5.89">if you look beyond the stock market you</text>
  <text start="181.379" dur="4.741">can see what&amp;#39;s actually going on now</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="5.759">Gannett their fourth-quarter profit was</text>
  <text start="186.12" dur="6.06">down by twelve percent then this is the</text>
  <text start="189.299" dur="5.041">company that is a media company that</text>
  <text start="192.18" dur="4.199">publishes like USA Today and they own</text>
  <text start="194.34" dur="4.05">dozens of other type of newspapers and</text>
  <text start="196.379" dur="5.521">television stations and they earned</text>
  <text start="198.39" dur="7.319">about ninety point seven million and the</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="7.35">quarter ended of december twenty ninth</text>
  <text start="205.709" dur="6.81">and that was down from a hundred and 3.1</text>
  <text start="209.25" dur="6.419">million so their profits are falling</text>
  <text start="212.519" dur="5.701">because what they&amp;#39;re saying is that they</text>
  <text start="215.669" dur="5.611">are not getting the same companies</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="5.4">advertising in the media and of course</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re not advertising because their</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="4.11">sales are not up so if their sales</text>
  <text start="225.87" dur="4.679">aren&amp;#39;t up they don&amp;#39;t have the money to</text>
  <text start="227.73" dur="6.629">advertise and this is what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="230.549" dur="6.901">all over the place and again retail</text>
  <text start="234.359" dur="5.761">sales usually advertise on TV and in</text>
  <text start="237.45" dur="5.369">newspapers if they are closing stores</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="5.459">laying off people because they are not</text>
  <text start="242.819" dur="5.551">bringing in the revenue it makes it very</text>
  <text start="245.579" dur="4.981">tough for them to pay for these gigantic</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="6.209">ad spots and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="7.139">is that radio shack is closing 500</text>
  <text start="254.579" dur="6.571">stores they closed 500 stores last year</text>
  <text start="257.699" dur="8.451">and they&amp;#39;re closing 500 more this year</text>
  <text start="261.15" dur="8.18">so what we are seeing is that retail is</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="5.92">not thriving it&amp;#39;s not getting better</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="4.809">people do not have the disposable income</text>
  <text start="272.07" dur="4.349">to pay for</text>
  <text start="274.139" dur="5.071">the goods that&amp;#39;s what it comes down to</text>
  <text start="276.419" dur="5.4">and if we look at the retail chain</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="6.269">stores year-to-year percentage it is</text>
  <text start="281.819" dur="6.96">right now at zero percent if we look</text>
  <text start="285.479" dur="5.671">back to two thousand eight it was around</text>
  <text start="288.779" dur="8.82">at negative 2 percent then it rose to</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="9.12">about about 5.2 percent by 2010 and then</text>
  <text start="297.599" dur="5.43">we had a steady decline from that point</text>
  <text start="300.27" dur="4.53">on to now back to zero percent now again</text>
  <text start="303.029" dur="4.591">we have to remember we have to use</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="6.329">common sense if unemployment was much</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="6.06">higher back in 2010 and now we&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="311.129" dur="5.22">to six point seven percent wouldn&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="313.68" dur="5.91">think that people have more income now</text>
  <text start="316.349" dur="5.731">to spend in retail and retail sales</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="5.329">would be going up why are they going</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="5.79">down well because the numbers are</text>
  <text start="324.919" dur="6.071">manipulated it&amp;#39;s a complete illusion and</text>
  <text start="327.87" dur="4.62">people do not have the disposable income</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="5.19">and this is what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="5.549">now factory orders drop most in five</text>
  <text start="336.18" dur="4.919">months factory orders dropped around</text>
  <text start="338.039" dur="7.5">1.5% in December their biggest fall</text>
  <text start="341.099" dur="8.07">since July and us December durables</text>
  <text start="345.539" dur="7.62">orders drop 4.2 percent we can see what</text>
  <text start="349.169" dur="7.201">is happening things are not going well</text>
  <text start="353.159" dur="5.211">factory orders are dropping people are</text>
  <text start="356.37" dur="5.009">not buying and guess what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="358.37" dur="6.88">inventory surged to new record high and</text>
  <text start="361.379" dur="6.681">at the fastest pace in six months again</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="6.24">we have to remember the automobile</text>
  <text start="368.06" dur="6.329">manufacturers have been channel stuffing</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="6.389">these dealerships are reported this on I</text>
  <text start="374.389" dur="5.68">on this yesterday and they have more</text>
  <text start="377.879" dur="4.951">than a hundred and fourteen days worth</text>
  <text start="380.069" dur="5.611">of inventory yes manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="4.639">producing but they&amp;#39;re reaching the point</text>
  <text start="385.68" dur="7.38">where they can&amp;#39;t give any more inventory</text>
  <text start="387.469" dur="7.93">to two dealerships retail stores are not</text>
  <text start="393.06" dur="4.949">taking orders anymore because they just</text>
  <text start="395.399" dur="5.04">can&amp;#39;t move the stuff so factories are</text>
  <text start="398.009" dur="4.89">starting to seize up right now and this</text>
  <text start="400.439" dur="6.181">is what we see happening and we have to</text>
  <text start="402.899" dur="5.041">remember things are an illusion just</text>
  <text start="406.62" dur="3.33">remember this every time you</text>
  <text start="407.94" dur="3.75">here these government officials and</text>
  <text start="409.95" dur="4.26">their ridiculous stats that come out</text>
  <text start="411.69" dur="5.1">always think the opposite and look past</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="4.65">that and we&amp;#39;re looking at things that</text>
  <text start="416.79" dur="3.69">there are happening now all over the</text>

  <text start="533.94" dur="4.59">they want they want everyone to believe</text>

  <text start="555.88" dur="4.98">down type of market right now because we</text>
  <text start="558.279" dur="5.071">I believe what we hit the top and we are</text>
  <text start="560.86" dur="3.39">on our way down at this point but I</text>
  <text start="563.35" dur="3.12">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to come down</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="5.43">tomorrow I think we have a little bit</text>

  <text start="603.13" dur="3.63">the market up as best they could it</text>
  <text start="604.96" dur="4.86">pretty much went nowhere actually and we</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="8.329">might even see a decline in the markets</text>
  <text start="609.82" dur="7.59">tomorrow now we understand that china is</text>
  <text start="615.089" dur="4.151">positioning themselves to become the</text>

  <text start="631.089" dur="5.011">people in China they want everyone to</text>
  <text start="633.43" dur="5.099">old own gold and if you compare to the</text>
  <text start="636.1" dur="4.59">united states where they say gold is a</text>
  <text start="638.529" dur="4.051">relic do not own it it&amp;#39;s better if you</text>
  <text start="640.69" dur="4.38">have a piece of paper that&amp;#39;s more</text>

  <text start="1064.82" dur="5.849">I believe this was for the insurance</text>
  <text start="1067.429" dur="5.001">company this was used to create revenue</text>
  <text start="1070.669" dur="5.691">for the government and</text>

  <text start="1077.86" dur="5.91">the American people of their money and</text>
  <text start="1080.95" dur="5.64">this is all this is because the US</text>
  <text start="1083.77" dur="6.03">government cannot pay for the debt right</text>
  <text start="1086.59" dur="5.37">now it&amp;#39;s unsustainable they cannot do it</text>
  <text start="1089.8" dur="3.54">they do not have their tax revenue at</text>
  <text start="1091.96" dur="3.42">this point and this is why they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1093.34" dur="4.65">all across the world using facta and</text>
  <text start="1095.38" dur="4.74">having other banks turn in people who</text>

  <text start="1113.11" dur="4.29">what is happening here their deaths</text>
  <text start="1114.82" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re desperate right now to get as</text>
  <text start="1117.4" dur="4.65">much revenue as possible and they</text>
  <text start="1119.83" dur="4.65">thought Obamacare was going to be the</text>
  <text start="1122.05" dur="4.32">answer because I just saw a report that</text>
  <text start="1124.48" dur="4.23">they were supposedly going to bring in</text>
  <text start="1126.37" dur="4.38">about 16 billion eight billion for the</text>
  <text start="1128.71" dur="5.85">insurance companies eight billion worth</text>
  <text start="1130.75" dur="5.91">of revenue into the government but that</text>
  <text start="1134.56" dur="4.8">has been pretty much falling apart at</text>
  <text start="1136.66" dur="5.43">this time and we understand that people</text>
  <text start="1139.36" dur="4.65">are not signing up companies do not want</text>
  <text start="1142.09" dur="4.26">it they are laying off they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="1149.74" dur="3.9">people they&amp;#39;re limiting the amount of</text>

  <text start="1163.36" dur="4.41">whatever you want to call it now they</text>
  <text start="1165.76" dur="4.32">revise that and now they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1167.77" dur="4.17">about 2.3 million well why don&amp;#39;t we just</text>
  <text start="1170.08" dur="3.96">double that number right now it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1171.94" dur="3.42">to be about 4.6 million because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1174.04" dur="3.3">always off and they&amp;#39;re always low</text>
  <text start="1175.36" dur="5.4">bowling this because companies have</text>
  <text start="1177.34" dur="6.36">already made the move forever 21 home</text>
  <text start="1180.76" dur="6.06">depot and many other companies have</text>
  <text start="1183.7" dur="4.65">already said listen we are not paying</text>
  <text start="1186.82" dur="3.6">for health insurance you can go to the</text>
  <text start="1188.35" dur="4.05">exchange will pay for the employees were</text>
  <text start="1190.42" dur="4.17">working full time but we are cutting</text>
  <text start="1192.4" dur="4.98">hours so we don&amp;#39;t have to get involved</text>
  <text start="1194.59" dur="5.85">with Obamacare and many of the companies</text>
  <text start="1197.38" dur="5.76">if you are working will pay for the the</text>

  <text start="1207.47" dur="5.04">have to remember if you do not take the</text>
  <text start="1209.84" dur="6.75">insurance what happens you are penalized</text>
  <text start="1212.51" dur="5.94">there are taxes intertwined in Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1216.59" dur="5.25">and you will be paying more and more</text>
  <text start="1218.45" dur="6.81">taxes because this is a cash grab they</text>
  <text start="1221.84" dur="4.98">need the revenue and right now what they</text>
  <text start="1225.26" dur="3.42">thought was going to happen is not</text>
  <text start="1226.82" dur="4.71">happening they will not be getting the</text>
  <text start="1228.68" dur="5.4">revenue and they are running into</text>
  <text start="1231.53" dur="4.5">problems with this now we have to</text>
  <text start="1234.08" dur="4.08">remember that they understand that the</text>

  <text start="1261.44" dur="5.87">we can see they&amp;#39;re dressing them up in</text>

  <text start="1288.02" dur="5.01">right now to get everything ready and</text>
  <text start="1290.9" dur="5.94">one of the biggest things is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1293.03" dur="6.27">trying to get as many weapons off the</text>
  <text start="1296.84" dur="6.69">street as possible especially in those</text>
  <text start="1299.3" dur="6.99">areas that are very dense where there is</text>
  <text start="1303.53" dur="5.75">a huge population and this is why if you</text>
  <text start="1306.29" dur="6.24">look at all the states and the cities</text>
  <text start="1309.28" dur="9.24">they have implemented your cone ian gun</text>

  <text start="1329.83" dur="4.87">really cut down on what people have</text>
  <text start="1332.63" dur="4.08">because the amount of the population is</text>

  <text start="1336.71" dur="5.25">to control the people in these air</text>
  <text start="1339.8" dur="3.87">is and this is why like New York created</text>
  <text start="1341.96" dur="3.75">the SAFE Act which is like the Dianne</text>

  <text start="1383.15" dur="6.93">them in and there is there even</text>
  <text start="1386.18" dur="6.93">proposing a firearm insurance liability</text>

  <text start="1932.74" dur="7.26">when the deal goes south they could say</text>
  <text start="1935.71" dur="6.81">look he said they had lone Wolf&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="1940" dur="5.19">had Iranian operatives within the United</text>
  <text start="1942.52" dur="5.76">States and all of a sudden we have a</text>
  <text start="1945.19" dur="4.8">certain event and we can see what is</text>
  <text start="1948.28" dur="4.92">happening now they are building the</text>
  <text start="1949.99" dur="4.95">propaganda with Assad and I&amp;#39;ve discussed</text>
  <text start="1953.2" dur="4.92">this in length and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1954.94" dur="5.52">continually build the propaganda with</text>
  <text start="1958.12" dur="4.47">Assad because eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1960.46" dur="4.05">happen is they&amp;#39;re going to be there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1962.59" dur="4.95">going to be an event where they need to</text>
  <text start="1964.51" dur="4.5">go into Syria and this is telling us</text>
  <text start="1967.54" dur="4.11">right here what I&amp;#39;m going to discuss</text>
  <text start="1969.01" dur="4.86">next of why they need to go in there</text>
  <text start="1971.65" dur="4.26">because they&amp;#39;re making no headway with</text>
  <text start="1973.87" dur="3.48">the rebels and this is this has been</text>
  <text start="1975.91" dur="4.62">going on for quite a while right now</text>
  <text start="1977.35" dur="5.34">things since 2011 or so now US</text>
  <text start="1980.53" dur="3.87">intelligence chief james clapper</text>
  <text start="1982.69" dur="3.9">testified before a US House of</text>
  <text start="1984.4" dur="4.92">Representatives Intelligence Committee</text>
  <text start="1986.59" dur="5.25">on Tuesday that last year&amp;#39;s agreement to</text>
  <text start="1989.32" dur="5.4">eliminate Syria&amp;#39;s chemical weapons left</text>
  <text start="1991.84" dur="5.37">President Bashar Assad in a strengthened</text>
  <text start="1994.72" dur="5.31">position thus proc the prospects are</text>
  <text start="1997.21" dur="6">right are right now that Assad is</text>
  <text start="2000.03" dur="6.63">actually in a strengthened position then</text>
  <text start="2003.21" dur="4.48">when we discuss this last year clapper</text>
  <text start="2006.66" dur="2.68">also said</text>
  <text start="2007.69" dur="3.75">ods government is likely to stay in</text>
  <text start="2009.34" dur="3.959">power with the current state of fighting</text>
  <text start="2011.44" dur="5.579">between the regime and rebel forces and</text>
  <text start="2013.299" dur="7.08">he foresees kind of that that this</text>
  <text start="2017.019" dur="5.701">entire fighting is a complete stalemate</text>
  <text start="2020.379" dur="4.711">where neither the regime or the opposite</text>
  <text start="2022.72" dur="6.299">opposition can prevail and they are</text>
  <text start="2025.09" dur="6.75">telling you this right now the fighting</text>
  <text start="2029.019" dur="5.04">that is going on is going to go nowhere</text>
  <text start="2031.84" dur="4.679">at this time and they understand this</text>
  <text start="2034.059" dur="4.49">this is why they did the false flag back</text>
  <text start="2036.519" dur="5.461">in August because they realized it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2038.549" dur="6.46">time it&amp;#39;s time to strike it&amp;#39;s time to</text>
  <text start="2041.98" dur="6.54">move into Syria nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="2045.009" dur="6.06">their goal is exactly the same they just</text>
  <text start="2048.52" dur="4.889">needed to regroup and create a new plan</text>
  <text start="2051.069" dur="4.32">this is why you see the Syrian</text>
  <text start="2053.409" dur="5.311">electronic army and you see it in the</text>
  <text start="2055.389" dur="7.44">news them attacking everywhere on paypal</text>
  <text start="2058.72" dur="6.09">ebay Microsoft CNN and they are building</text>
  <text start="2062.829" dur="3.961">the propaganda there this is why you see</text>
  <text start="2064.81" dur="3.809">the biological emic weapons chemical</text>
  <text start="2066.79" dur="4.23">weapons they have reports that it is</text>
  <text start="2068.619" dur="4.621">hidden in the Alawite communities and</text>
  <text start="2071.02" dur="4.589">the UN inspectors have no knowledge of</text>
  <text start="2073.24" dur="4.2">this but America but the American</text>
  <text start="2075.609" dur="4.29">intelligence does have information on</text>
  <text start="2077.44" dur="5.37">this this is why you see before the</text>
  <text start="2079.899" dur="5.25">Geneva 2 talks he the reports are coming</text>
  <text start="2082.81" dur="4.71">out that he has something to do with war</text>
  <text start="2085.149" dur="5.28">crimes they&amp;#39;re destroying villages and</text>
  <text start="2087.52" dur="5.04">you can see what they are building right</text>
  <text start="2090.429" dur="5.19">now because they are ready and they were</text>
  <text start="2092.56" dur="5.46">preparing for the event to strike into</text>
  <text start="2095.619" dur="6.361">Syria and they realize the only way to</text>
  <text start="2098.02" dur="5.64">do this is to do it someplace in America</text>
  <text start="2101.98" dur="4.349">because this will wake up the American</text>
  <text start="2103.66" dur="5.459">people it will wake up Congress and when</text>
  <text start="2106.329" dur="4.951">this happens they can say listen they</text>
  <text start="2109.119" dur="5.041">struck the financial institution we had</text>
  <text start="2111.28" dur="5.4">reports of Syrian electronic army going</text>
  <text start="2114.16" dur="5.189">back you know months now and they</text>
  <text start="2116.68" dur="4.74">finally did it they hit the banking</text>
  <text start="2119.349" dur="3.691">industry they hit the stock market this</text>
  <text start="2121.42" dur="3.689">is why we&amp;#39;ve been seeing glitches and</text>
  <text start="2123.04" dur="5.039">the NASDAQ and the chicago mercantile</text>
  <text start="2125.109" dur="4.71">and they are just preparing for what is</text>
  <text start="2128.079" dur="4.111">coming they also said that they have</text>
  <text start="2129.819" dur="4.711">biological chemical weapons hidden we</text>
  <text start="2132.19" dur="4.889">can see those being used here in the</text>
  <text start="2134.53" dur="6.15">states and they are just building this</text>
  <text start="2137.079" dur="4.441">up and when the time is right they will</text>
  <text start="2140.68" dur="3.96">do</text>
  <text start="2141.52" dur="7.14">this and this will allow the US people</text>
  <text start="2144.64" dur="7.29">to beg for war with Syria and they will</text>
  <text start="2148.66" dur="5.31">eventually get the entire war started</text>
  <text start="2151.93" dur="4.83">and this will spread because we have to</text>
  <text start="2153.97" dur="8.13">remember Russia and China are backing</text>
  <text start="2156.76" dur="7.83">Syria Iran has a pact with Syria that</text>
  <text start="2162.1" dur="4.44">they will help them if they are invaded</text>
  <text start="2164.59" dur="3.42">so we can see what is happening right</text>
  <text start="2166.54" dur="4.92">now and that gives them a direct line</text>
  <text start="2168.01" dur="5.93">once they strike Syria to go into a ram</text>
  <text start="2171.46" dur="7.02">because Iran is going to join the fight</text>
  <text start="2173.94" dur="6.37">this is how this is going to play out we</text>
  <text start="2178.48" dur="4.44">can see them building we can see what</text>
  <text start="2180.31" dur="5.45">they&amp;#39;re doing and they are ready to move</text>
  <text start="2182.92" dur="5.67">forward with this and again this whole</text>
  <text start="2185.76" dur="4.96">the whole reason for this is they think</text>
  <text start="2188.59" dur="4.41">they can prop the US dollar for a longer</text>
  <text start="2190.72" dur="6.69">period of time but the bigger reason is</text>
  <text start="2193" dur="6.48">to get into China because that is the</text>
  <text start="2197.41" dur="4.62">biggest threat this is where they want</text>
  <text start="2199.48" dur="4.38">the war this is why Japan has been</text>
  <text start="2202.03" dur="3.78">moving military assets trying to change</text>
  <text start="2203.86" dur="4.17">their constitution this is why the</text>
  <text start="2205.81" dur="4.65">United States is moving their base on</text>
  <text start="2208.03" dur="5.22">Japan so they can ship in more</text>
  <text start="2210.46" dur="4.62">sophisticated weapons we can see they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2213.25" dur="3.84">been setting this up this is why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2215.08" dur="4.11">called the pivot to Asia because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2217.09" dur="4.83">moving all the military assets in this</text>
  <text start="2219.19" dur="5.19">region to get ready for World War three</text>
  <text start="2221.92" dur="4.91">okay now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="2224.38" dur="5.61">Obamacare website is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="2226.83" dur="5.38">Michelle Obama had her friend do it they</text>
  <text start="2229.99" dur="4.44">didn&amp;#39;t code it right it wasn&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="2232.21" dur="5.37">correctly there are so many flaws</text>
  <text start="2234.43" dur="5.16">security flaws in it the taxpayers of</text>
  <text start="2237.58" dur="3.96">the United States spent billions and</text>
  <text start="2239.59" dur="5.46">billions of dollars on something that</text>
  <text start="2241.54" dur="6.27">just does not work and their fear has</text>
  <text start="2245.05" dur="6.3">always been that your information was</text>
  <text start="2247.81" dur="5.91">not safe that this website can be hacked</text>
  <text start="2251.35" dur="4.59">could be cyber attack and the whole</text>
  <text start="2253.72" dur="5.52">entire thing can come tumbling down and</text>
  <text start="2255.94" dur="6.9">right now there is some fear out there</text>
  <text start="2259.24" dur="5.76">from former Soviet republic that</text>
  <text start="2262.84" dur="5.16">inserted malicious code into the</text>
  <text start="2265" dur="4.68">Obamacare site US intelligence is urging</text>
  <text start="2268" dur="3.9">the Obama administration to check its</text>

  <text start="2273.78" dur="3.76">developers linked to</text>
  <text start="2275.29" dur="4.59">the belorus government helped produce</text>

  <text start="2288.94" dur="4.74">in bella risk by software developers</text>
  <text start="2291.34" dur="4.07">under state control and that makes the</text>
  <text start="2293.68" dur="4.65">software a potential target for</text>
  <text start="2295.41" dur="5.47">cyberattacks cyber security officials</text>
  <text start="2298.33" dur="5.07">said the concerns are compounded by an</text>
  <text start="2300.88" dur="4.73">internal data hijacking incident last</text>
  <text start="2303.4" dur="4.68">year involving belorus of course and</text>
  <text start="2305.61" dur="5.44">they are looking at this and we</text>
  <text start="2308.08" dur="6.69">understand this would be a perfect way</text>
  <text start="2311.05" dur="8.19">out of this disaster what this disaster</text>
  <text start="2314.77" dur="7.41">website for Obama having Russia attack</text>
  <text start="2319.24" dur="6.3">the website bringing it down completely</text>
  <text start="2322.18" dur="5.79">destroying it allowing the propaganda to</text>
  <text start="2325.54" dur="5.79">go forward to blame Russia for cyber</text>
  <text start="2327.97" dur="7.74">attacking and this we can see is all in</text>
  <text start="2331.33" dur="7.86">preparation for Obama to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="2335.71" dur="5.76">website and to demonize Russia it is</text>
  <text start="2339.19" dur="5.34">perfect they are completely setting this</text>
  <text start="2341.47" dur="5.91">up and we can see this moving forward</text>
  <text start="2344.53" dur="5.61">now there is a report out there saying</text>
  <text start="2347.38" dur="4.95">that the u.s. is evaluating China&amp;#39;s EMP</text>
  <text start="2350.14" dur="4.83">threat and this goes on to say that the</text>
  <text start="2352.33" dur="5.6">growing EMP threat seems to escape the</text>
  <text start="2354.97" dur="5.58">Obama administration according to Rachel</text>
  <text start="2357.93" dur="4.93">amarin Feld of the washington-based</text>
  <text start="2360.55" dur="3.96">American Center for Democracy she</text>
  <text start="2362.86" dur="4.23">pointed out that as far back as</text>
  <text start="2364.51" dur="5.04">September 2002 Defense Secretary Donald</text>
  <text start="2367.09" dur="4.92">Rumsfeld had warned that countries have</text>
  <text start="2369.55" dur="5.19">placed ballistic missiles in ships such</text>
  <text start="2372.01" dur="5.81">as cargo commercial ships all over the</text>
  <text start="2374.74" dur="6.99">world at any given time run Seoul said</text>
  <text start="2377.82" dur="6.75">there there&amp;#39;s any number of ships off</text>
  <text start="2381.73" dur="5.52">our coast coming and going on</text>
  <text start="2384.57" dur="5.14">transporter erector launchers and they</text>
  <text start="2387.25" dur="5.1">simply erected fire off the ballistic</text>
  <text start="2389.71" dur="5.82">missile put it down cover it up their</text>
  <text start="2392.35" dur="5.52">radar signatures not signatures not any</text>
  <text start="2395.53" dur="4.08">different than the 50 others quote in</text>
  <text start="2397.87" dur="4.71">close proximity so what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="2399.61" dur="5.76">is that any cargo ship coming in off the</text>
  <text start="2402.58" dur="5.91">coast of the US could have a ballistic</text>
  <text start="2405.37" dur="4.01">missile there could be a launcher inside</text>
  <text start="2408.49" dur="2.96">they could</text>
  <text start="2409.38" dur="4.53">raised the launcher shoot off a</text>
  <text start="2411.45" dur="4.56">ballistic missile and exploded over the</text>
  <text start="2413.91" dur="4.47">United States which would cause an EMP</text>
  <text start="2416.01" dur="5.58">effect and this is what Rumsfeld said</text>
  <text start="2418.38" dur="5.58">back in 2002 and it&amp;#39;s amazing how these</text>
  <text start="2421.59" dur="5.67">things always come up later on and then</text>
  <text start="2423.96" dur="6.06">actually end up happening but this goes</text>
  <text start="2427.26" dur="5.01">on to say that Cooper has contended that</text>
  <text start="2430.02" dur="4.56">the North Koreans tend to undertake</text>
  <text start="2432.27" dur="5.22">missile tests using a south polar orbit</text>
  <text start="2434.58" dur="5.1">against the US does not have a missile</text>
  <text start="2437.49" dur="4.65">defense especially if the missile has an</text>
  <text start="2439.68" dur="4.65">EMP nuclear device called a super EMP</text>
  <text start="2442.14" dur="4.77">which North Korea is thought to be</text>
  <text start="2444.33" dur="4.74">developing so this report is telling us</text>
  <text start="2446.91" dur="4.77">that the Obama administration is not</text>
  <text start="2449.07" dur="5.58">looking at any type of EMP attack and</text>
  <text start="2451.68" dur="5.49">going back as far as 2002 back to</text>
  <text start="2454.65" dur="6.45">Rumsfeld they are stating that this</text>
  <text start="2457.17" dur="7.77">could be possible to bring down the</text>
  <text start="2461.1" dur="6.18">power grid and knock out our electronics</text>
  <text start="2464.94" dur="4.77">so you know we can see what is happening</text>
  <text start="2467.28" dur="6.75">here the propaganda is being built up</text>
  <text start="2469.71" dur="7.88">over and over demonizing North cara d</text>
  <text start="2474.03" dur="6.84">minh izing china and this is going</text>
  <text start="2477.59" dur="6.04">forward and on and on and on as time</text>
  <text start="2480.87" dur="4.71">goes on because we understand all those</text>
  <text start="2483.63" dur="4.65">countries that do not have a private</text>
  <text start="2485.58" dur="6.03">western central bank which are a threat</text>
  <text start="2488.28" dur="5.94">to the US government and the central</text>
  <text start="2491.61" dur="5.43">bankers are the enemy and this is why</text>
  <text start="2494.22" dur="6.21">they continually demonize these</text>
  <text start="2497.04" dur="5.7">countries okay now the FBI is conducting</text>
  <text start="2500.43" dur="5.34">interviews in the US with people from</text>
  <text start="2502.74" dur="6.15">the Caucasus and this is we understand</text>
  <text start="2505.77" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s a very small community of people</text>
  <text start="2508.89" dur="3.69">from the caucuses in the United States</text>
  <text start="2510.54" dur="5.19">but the FBI is trying to find</text>
  <text start="2512.58" dur="5.22">information if they&amp;#39;ve heard anything</text>
  <text start="2515.73" dur="4.02">about any type of terrorists threats</text>
  <text start="2517.8" dur="4.89">because they&amp;#39;re worried if something</text>
  <text start="2519.75" dur="6.63">does happen in Sochi Olympics something</text>
  <text start="2522.69" dur="6.48">might occur here and again this is all</text>
  <text start="2526.38" dur="5.1">part of the agenda to demonize Russia</text>
  <text start="2529.17" dur="4.14">actually to demonize all those countries</text>
  <text start="2531.48" dur="4.77">that do not have a private western</text>
  <text start="2533.31" dur="4.56">central bank because any country that</text>
  <text start="2536.25" dur="4.14">does not have a private western central</text>
  <text start="2537.87" dur="4.32">bank is the enemy of the central bankers</text>
  <text start="2540.39" dur="2.82">and the US government and this is why</text>
  <text start="2542.19" dur="3.21">you see</text>
  <text start="2543.21" dur="4.29">all the information coming out from the</text>
  <text start="2545.4" dur="5.52">cyber attacks from China from North</text>
  <text start="2547.5" dur="4.95">Korea from Syria from Russia and this is</text>
  <text start="2550.92" dur="4.41">why they build this propaganda up</text>
  <text start="2552.45" dur="4.71">because eventually when the war get</text>
  <text start="2555.33" dur="4.14">started these are the countries that</text>
  <text start="2557.16" dur="4.41">people will say oh yeah I understand</text>
  <text start="2559.47" dur="4.47">that I remember hearing about this and</text>
  <text start="2561.57" dur="4.799">they&amp;#39;re the ones who attacked us listen</text>
