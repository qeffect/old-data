  <text start="37.81" dur="5.79">third 2016 and the title of the episode</text>
  <text start="40.3" dur="5.85">is the entire economy is all smoke and</text>
  <text start="43.6" dur="5.79">mirrors prepare for the economic</text>
  <text start="46.15" dur="5.88">collapse let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="49.39" dur="6.72">collapse financial news now today the</text>
  <text start="52.03" dur="5.97">market was moving quickly downward when</text>
  <text start="56.11" dur="3.6">the job numbers came out and we can see</text>
  <text start="58" dur="5.97">all over the corporate media the job</text>
  <text start="59.71" dur="8.34">numbers were not good but we saw at the</text>
  <text start="63.97" dur="7.2">same exact time gold surged by 30 plus</text>
  <text start="68.05" dur="9.03">dollars now it&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="71.17" dur="9.059">all of this is that we received terrible</text>
  <text start="77.08" dur="5.34">job numbers but the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="80.229" dur="7.531">dropped to four-point-seven percent now</text>
  <text start="82.42" dur="6.809">I look at the information and I said</text>
  <text start="87.76" dur="3.149">that most likely they&amp;#39;re going to bring</text>
  <text start="89.229" dur="4.171">it to around four point eight percent</text>
  <text start="90.909" dur="4.531">well they surpass that and I decide you</text>
  <text start="93.4" dur="5.66">know what let&amp;#39;s go for it let&amp;#39;s go for</text>
  <text start="95.44" dur="6.57">4.7 because that looks really good and</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="5.65">this will convince everyone that we are</text>
  <text start="102.01" dur="6.84">in a complete recovery but when we look</text>
  <text start="104.71" dur="6.36">at the job numbers they are awful the</text>
  <text start="108.85" dur="5.28">BLS they reported that in May that they</text>
  <text start="111.07" dur="7.35">added thirty eight thousand jobs well</text>
  <text start="114.13" dur="6.87">this is the lowest since 2010 the</text>
  <text start="118.42" dur="5.91">household survey well that was just as</text>
  <text start="121" dur="5.67">bad twenty-six thousand jobs added in</text>
  <text start="124.33" dur="5.299">May bringing the total to about a</text>
  <text start="126.67" dur="5.25">hundred and fifty one thousand jobs and</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="4.39">we know that the unemployment rate it</text>
  <text start="131.92" dur="4.649">dropped to four-point-seven percent this</text>
  <text start="134.019" dur="6.901">is the lowest since august of 2007 and</text>
  <text start="136.569" dur="9.081">what happened in 2008 that&amp;#39;s right the</text>
  <text start="140.92" dur="9.51">entire economy started to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="9.85">the unemployment rate shot up so we see</text>
  <text start="150.43" dur="7.11">there are 90 4.7 million people that are</text>
  <text start="155.5" dur="3.719">out of the labor force it increased by</text>
  <text start="157.54" dur="5.099">six hundred and sixty four thousand in</text>
  <text start="159.219" dur="4.661">one month and of course what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="162.639" dur="2.951">saying is that these people don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="163.88" dur="3.27">job they don&amp;#39;t want to earn a living</text>
  <text start="165.59" dur="3.33">they don&amp;#39;t want to support the family</text>
  <text start="167.15" dur="3.81">they don&amp;#39;t want to go on vacation they</text>
  <text start="168.92" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t pay rent they don&amp;#39;t to pay their</text>
  <text start="170.96" dur="6.3">electric bill no what&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="173.39" dur="7.14">there are no jobs this is the problem so</text>
  <text start="177.26" dur="5.85">in total there&amp;#39;s about 102 million plus</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="6.27">Americans who are either on it who are</text>
  <text start="183.11" dur="6.87">unemployed or no longer looking for work</text>
  <text start="186.8" dur="7.97">because they can&amp;#39;t find any so we have a</text>
  <text start="189.98" dur="7.37">major major problem in this country now</text>
  <text start="194.77" dur="6.51">the US government reported that in May</text>
  <text start="197.35" dur="6.43">59,000 full-time jobs were lost however</text>
  <text start="201.28" dur="6.13">we see there were a hundred and eighteen</text>
  <text start="203.78" dur="5.46">thousand part-time jobs that were gained</text>
  <text start="207.41" dur="3.39">now I don&amp;#39;t know where they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="209.24" dur="3.87">this number from because when we look at</text>
  <text start="210.8" dur="4.26">retail we see stores closing left and</text>
  <text start="213.11" dur="4.62">right and these numbers do not make</text>
  <text start="215.06" dur="5.67">sense but if we take what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="217.73" dur="5.66">and we take it as truth which we know it</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="5.58">is not but let&amp;#39;s just go down that path</text>
  <text start="223.39" dur="7.71">we see that we&amp;#39;re replacing these</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="10.88">full-time jobs with part-time jobs so</text>
  <text start="231.1" dur="13.32">over the past two months the labor force</text>
  <text start="237.19" dur="13.21">has lost 312,000 full-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="9.76">we&amp;#39;ve gained 118 part-time jobs this</text>
  <text start="250.4" dur="6.99">does not look good this shows us that</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="6.48">things are not going well so we have</text>
  <text start="257.39" dur="6.02">millions of people out of the job market</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="7.1">because they can&amp;#39;t find work we have</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="6.52">people losing their full-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="267.76" dur="6.79">somewhere somehow people are getting</text>
  <text start="269.93" dur="10.01">part-time jobs and think about this for</text>
  <text start="274.55" dur="9.9">a second once the full impact of</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="5.95">Obamacare hits businesses where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.45" dur="4.65">going to reduce hours get rid of</text>
  <text start="285.89" dur="5.37">employees what do you think the scenario</text>
  <text start="289.1" dur="6.33">is going to look like it is going to</text>
  <text start="291.26" dur="5.909">look a lot worse now since december of</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="5.609">2014</text>
  <text start="297.169" dur="7.55">the US has added 455,000 waiters and</text>
  <text start="301.039" dur="7.321">bartenders while losing 10,000</text>
  <text start="304.719" dur="6.461">manufacturing workers and if we go back</text>
  <text start="308.36" dur="5.549">in time we can see that all the</text>
  <text start="311.18" dur="5.37">manufacturing jobs are being replaced</text>
  <text start="313.909" dur="6.12">with waiters bartenders waitresses</text>
  <text start="316.55" dur="6.26">because these people cannot find the</text>
  <text start="320.029" dur="5.7">same full-time jobs manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="6.699">pretty much dead here in the US a lot of</text>
  <text start="325.729" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s been shipped off overseas so when</text>
  <text start="329.509" dur="5.041">we&amp;#39;re looking at all these indicators we</text>
  <text start="331.909" dur="6.271">are seeing that this economy is not</text>
  <text start="334.55" dur="7.26">doing what the president has said where</text>
  <text start="338.18" dur="5.94">he said that the economy is in full</text>
  <text start="341.81" dur="4.199">recovery this is what they want everyone</text>
  <text start="344.12" dur="4.229">to believe we are coming up to an</text>
  <text start="346.009" dur="4.801">election time period you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="348.349" dur="5.581">make it look really really good actually</text>
  <text start="350.81" dur="5.279">this happened right when we were in the</text>
  <text start="353.93" dur="3.84">2008 elections where they tried to</text>
  <text start="356.089" dur="4.11">pretend the economy was doing very well</text>
  <text start="357.77" dur="4.41">everything was contained and it</text>
  <text start="360.199" dur="4.53">completely fell apart right before the</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="5.489">elections and it feels like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.729" dur="8.49">heading down that same path now to add</text>
  <text start="367.669" dur="7.47">to the misery we see in April the US</text>
  <text start="373.219" dur="5.7">service sector had a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="375.139" dur="7.351">bounce but today it looks like the</text>
  <text start="378.919" dur="6.9">service sector well it imploded once</text>
  <text start="382.49" dur="5.489">again and it is not getting better new</text>
  <text start="385.819" dur="5.57">orders actually dropped it&amp;#39;s the biggest</text>
  <text start="387.979" dur="6.02">drop since 2008 and as we move forward</text>
  <text start="391.389" dur="6.941">things are not looking good at all</text>
  <text start="393.999" dur="7.15">actually US commercial bankruptcies they</text>
  <text start="398.33" dur="4.589">are soaring right now standard &amp;amp; poor&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.149" dur="5.13">reported that among the companies it</text>
  <text start="402.919" dur="6.06">rates there are 12 defaults in May which</text>
  <text start="406.279" dur="6.48">pushed its speculative grade corporate</text>
  <text start="408.979" dur="7.61">default rate up to 4.1 percent now this</text>
  <text start="412.759" dur="5.97">is the highest since december of 2010</text>
  <text start="416.589" dur="4.66">when we were recovering from the</text>
  <text start="418.729" dur="5.25">financial crisis according to the</text>
  <text start="421.249" dur="5.16">government of course so just five months</text>
  <text start="423.979" dur="5.951">ago the default rate was two-point-eight</text>
  <text start="426.409" dur="6.491">percent that&amp;#39;s how fast</text>
  <text start="429.93" dur="4.92">it is deteriorating even during the</text>
  <text start="432.9" dur="5.46">early phase of the financial crisis in</text>
  <text start="434.85" dur="5.849">September of 2008 when Lehman you know</text>
  <text start="438.36" dur="5.279">when they file for bankruptcy when</text>
  <text start="440.699" dur="5.391">everything was going crazy the default</text>
  <text start="443.639" dur="6.541">rate was only two point nine six percent</text>
  <text start="446.09" dur="6.94">we&amp;#39;re at 4.1 right now and then of</text>
  <text start="450.18" dur="5.28">course in 2009 it&amp;#39;s skyrocketed to</text>
  <text start="453.03" dur="6.84">twelve percent so right now we&amp;#39;re worse</text>
  <text start="455.46" dur="9.179">off then when we hit that crisis in 2008</text>
  <text start="459.87" dur="6.9">I mean red flags anybody what do you</text>
  <text start="464.639" dur="5.37">think is happening here this whole</text>
  <text start="466.77" dur="6.78">entire economy that the US government</text>
  <text start="470.009" dur="8.97">created with the Fed is all done with</text>
  <text start="473.55" dur="7.649">smoke and mirrors it&amp;#39;s an illusion so</text>
  <text start="478.979" dur="3.841">the total u.s. commercial bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="481.199" dur="4.831">filings in mace were thirty two percent</text>
  <text start="482.82" dur="6.3">from a year ago and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="486.03" dur="4.759">the American bankruptcy institute it was</text>
  <text start="489.12" dur="4.35">the seventh month in a row</text>
  <text start="490.789" dur="7.06">year-over-year that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="493.47" dur="5.55">increases in commercial filings and we</text>
  <text start="497.849" dur="2.431">know that commercial bankruptcies</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="3.959">they&amp;#39;re going to go higher and higher</text>
  <text start="500.28" dur="7.44">it&amp;#39;s going to get worse and worse as we</text>
  <text start="502.979" dur="6.331">move forward and of course Obama is out</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="5.309">there patting himself on the back that</text>
  <text start="509.31" dur="6.779">the economy is fantastic he has</text>
  <text start="513.029" dur="6.301">completely transformed America well in</text>
  <text start="516.089" dur="5.911">more ways than one but he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="519.33" dur="5.31">take credit for all of this and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522" dur="5.13">going to happen is that this economy is</text>
  <text start="524.64" dur="6.27">going to come tumbling down one way or</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="6.57">another now of course as we know the</text>
  <text start="530.91" dur="4.71">government the central bank they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="533.7" dur="4.259">going to take the blame for this they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="535.62" dur="4.409">never admit that they did anything wrong</text>
  <text start="537.959" dur="4.711">they&amp;#39;ll never admit that the economy was</text>
  <text start="540.029" dur="5.491">never strong they&amp;#39;re waiting for this</text>
  <text start="542.67" dur="5.1">special event and when the special event</text>
  <text start="545.52" dur="4.83">occurs we don&amp;#39;t know exactly what it is</text>
  <text start="547.77" dur="4.2">but it has to be something big it has to</text>
  <text start="550.35" dur="4.739">be something where the financial</text>
  <text start="551.97" dur="4.65">institution is hit they will blame this</text>
  <text start="555.089" dur="3.541">on another terrorist group another</text>
  <text start="556.62" dur="5.61">country whatever they have to do to take</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="5.16">blame off themselves this is why they</text>
  <text start="562.23" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t care that they&amp;#39;re creating bubbles</text>
  <text start="563.79" dur="3.81">this is why they don&amp;#39;t care if people</text>
  <text start="565.53" dur="4.44">realize is that people realize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.6" dur="4.62">going on because they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="569.97" dur="3.57">take your eyes and move them someplace</text>
  <text start="572.22" dur="3.51">else just like they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="573.54" dur="4.26">everyone&amp;#39;s eyes on the stock market just</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="4.5">look at the stock market that will tell</text>
  <text start="577.8" dur="4.8">you the story of the economy which we</text>
  <text start="580.23" dur="4.47">know is completely false it&amp;#39;s fake phony</text>
  <text start="582.6" dur="4.71">and false now as this economy</text>
  <text start="584.7" dur="5.13">continually deteriorates and we move</text>
  <text start="587.31" dur="3.72">into that collapse scenario Obama came</text>
  <text start="589.83" dur="4.5">out with a whopper saying let&amp;#39;s raise</text>
  <text start="591.03" dur="5.52">Social Security benefits yes this is the</text>
  <text start="594.33" dur="4.08">time to do it because the government</text>
  <text start="596.55" dur="5.04">needs to support everyone make everyone</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="6.78">feel good for when this economy</text>
  <text start="601.59" dur="5.73">collapses and if you notice the entire</text>
  <text start="605.19" dur="4.47">country is being supported by the</text>
  <text start="607.32" dur="4.74">government at this point the bubbles are</text>
  <text start="609.66" dur="5.55">being supported by the central bank and</text>
  <text start="612.06" dur="5.49">the government at this point and we have</text>
  <text start="615.21" dur="5.58">to realize that the US has approximately</text>
  <text start="617.55" dur="5.34">80 trillion unfunded liabilities for</text>
  <text start="620.79" dur="4.56">Social Security Medicare and other</text>
  <text start="622.89" dur="4.62">entitlements sitting atop a workforce</text>
  <text start="625.35" dur="5.58">that is rapidly aging and an economy</text>
  <text start="627.51" dur="5.82">that is collapsing now the president</text>
  <text start="630.93" dur="7.2">claims the sastra known as Obamacare is</text>
  <text start="633.33" dur="8.88">a complete success that he created 14</text>
  <text start="638.13" dur="7.89">million jobs well we know all this is</text>
  <text start="642.21" dur="10.13">not true i mean the thirteenth exchange</text>
  <text start="646.02" dur="8.67">has closed defaulted and we see that</text>
  <text start="652.34" dur="5.89">they haven&amp;#39;t reached the numbers in</text>
  <text start="654.69" dur="6.18">obamacare whatsoever the 14 million jobs</text>
  <text start="658.23" dur="6.71">he&amp;#39;s talking about well what are they</text>
  <text start="660.87" dur="7.35">part time non existing government jobs</text>
  <text start="664.94" dur="7.3">well guess what if you really look at</text>
  <text start="668.22" dur="8.28">this and we look at the facts there are</text>
  <text start="672.24" dur="7.32">fewer full-time full pay breadwinner</text>
  <text start="676.5" dur="8.73">jobs in America today then when bill</text>
  <text start="679.56" dur="9.36">clinton was president 16 years ago that</text>
  <text start="685.23" dur="5.79">should tell you something and we see at</text>
  <text start="688.92" dur="4.77">this point he&amp;#39;s using whatever he</text>
  <text start="691.02" dur="6.45">possibly can to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="693.69" dur="6.03">look how great the economy is and we</text>
  <text start="697.47" dur="3.69">what&amp;#39;s happening right now the opposite</text>
  <text start="699.72" dur="3.06">is happening they did this back in two</text>
  <text start="701.16" dur="3.23">thousand eight where they try to</text>
  <text start="702.78" dur="4.31">convince us that everything was fine</text>
  <text start="704.39" dur="5.08">where the economy was doing well</text>
  <text start="707.09" dur="5.5">everything&amp;#39;s contained there now</text>
  <text start="709.47" dur="4.86">forecasting a recession it feels like</text>
  <text start="712.59" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re at the same point once again but</text>
  <text start="714.33" dur="4.98">eight years later feels like nothing has</text>
  <text start="717.21" dur="4.92">really changed well actually things have</text>
  <text start="719.31" dur="4.86">changed it&amp;#39;s gotten a lot worse because</text>
  <text start="722.13" dur="4.02">this time the American people are</text>
  <text start="724.17" dur="4.56">sitting on the sidelines and the central</text>
  <text start="726.15" dur="6.56">bank and the US government created this</text>
  <text start="728.73" dur="7.32">entire fake phony and false economy and</text>
  <text start="732.71" dur="8.35">when this comes down it&amp;#39;s going to come</text>
