  <text start="54.91" dur="6.27">is februari 22nd 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="58.39" dur="4.79">episode is so it begins corporate media</text>
  <text start="61.18" dur="5.46">sets up narrative that the economy is</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="5.71">worsening let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="66.64" dur="6.089">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="68.89" dur="6.089">looking at the hard economic data and we</text>
  <text start="72.729" dur="5.971">have been seeing there are multiple</text>
  <text start="74.979" dur="6.601">signs of a recession actually we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="78.7" dur="6.86">recession and there are cities and towns</text>
  <text start="81.58" dur="9.09">and different areas that are trying to</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="7.87">survive and out in Philadelphia we see</text>
  <text start="90.67" dur="6.26">that Philadelphia became the first US</text>
  <text start="93.43" dur="6.39">city to pass a soda tax last summer and</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="4.51">of course city officials were eagerly</text>
  <text start="99.82" dur="3.84">looking forward to the surplus</text>
  <text start="101.44" dur="4.34">tax-funded windfall that they were going</text>
  <text start="103.66" dur="5.73">to get from the sales of the soda and</text>
  <text start="105.78" dur="7.21">they went ahead and they place this tax</text>
  <text start="109.39" dur="8.339">on soda now it came effective January</text>
  <text start="112.99" dur="6.69">first and they received for a 10 pack of</text>
  <text start="117.729" dur="5.371">flavored water carried a 51-percent</text>
  <text start="119.68" dur="5.85">beverage tax and since PA has a sales</text>
  <text start="123.1" dur="5.07">tax of six percent and Philly already</text>
  <text start="125.53" dur="6.11">charges another 2% the sales tax was</text>
  <text start="128.17" dur="5.76">eight percent in other words a purchase</text>
  <text start="131.64" dur="3.79">which until last year came to six</text>
  <text start="133.93" dur="3.119">dollars and forty-seven cents had</text>
  <text start="135.43" dur="4.98">overnight become nine dollars and</text>
  <text start="137.049" dur="4.5">seventy-five cents and these city</text>
  <text start="140.41" dur="2.52">officials were you know were rubbing</text>
  <text start="141.549" dur="3.811">their hands together gung-ho here come</text>
  <text start="142.93" dur="7.08">was all the money well guess what</text>
  <text start="145.36" dur="10.65">happened the opposite money didn&amp;#39;t start</text>
  <text start="150.01" dur="9.569">pouring in yes they had sales but there</text>
  <text start="156.01" dur="6.99">was a sticker shock and the purchases of</text>
  <text start="159.579" dur="6.361">soda collapsed supermarkets distributors</text>
  <text start="163" dur="6.54">are reporting a 30-percent to fifty</text>
  <text start="165.94" dur="6.75">percent drop in beverage sales and now</text>
  <text start="169.54" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re planning on layoffs now this has</text>
  <text start="172.69" dur="6.629">nothing to do with the soda tax because</text>
  <text start="176.35" dur="4.639">these distributors</text>
  <text start="179.319" dur="5.961">and supermarkets were having problems</text>
  <text start="180.989" dur="7.271">from the start but this just added to it</text>
  <text start="185.28" dur="4.75">one of the city&amp;#39;s largest distributors</text>
  <text start="188.26" dur="3.869">told Philadelphia website it would cut</text>
  <text start="190.03" dur="5.159">twenty percent of its workforce in March</text>
  <text start="192.129" dur="5.821">and owner of six shoprite stores in</text>
  <text start="195.189" dur="6.181">Philadelphia says he expects to shed 300</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="6.48">workers this spring what they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="201.37" dur="7.049">is a sales declined larger than anything</text>
  <text start="204.43" dur="7.32">they&amp;#39;ve seen before and we can see at</text>
  <text start="208.419" dur="5.4">this point that this is spreading too</text>
  <text start="211.75" dur="4.079">many areas and it has been for quite a</text>
  <text start="213.819" dur="3.87">while now the corporate media in the</text>
  <text start="215.829" dur="3.66">past has been hiding all this because</text>
  <text start="217.689" dur="3.961">they don&amp;#39;t come out and tell you hey the</text>
  <text start="219.489" dur="4.14">economy&amp;#39;s doing poorly they were going</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="4.11">with the Obama narrative saying that</text>
  <text start="223.629" dur="4.351">we&amp;#39;re recovering this is what you can</text>
  <text start="225.76" dur="4.949">expect from a recovery this is how</text>
  <text start="227.98" dur="6.03">anicut recovery works no this is how an</text>
  <text start="230.709" dur="6">illusion works this is how a bubble</text>
  <text start="234.01" dur="5.55">works so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="236.709" dur="7.381">Reuters they did an opinion poll to more</text>
  <text start="239.56" dur="6.299">than 4,200 US adults and one third of</text>
  <text start="244.09" dur="4.289">the respondents said they were eating in</text>
  <text start="245.859" dur="6">restaurant less often than three months</text>
  <text start="248.379" dur="6.72">ago the poll was conducted in the second</text>
  <text start="251.859" dur="5.4">half of January of them 62 percent cited</text>
  <text start="255.099" dur="5.82">well we just don&amp;#39;t have the money and</text>
  <text start="257.259" dur="7.771">the cost of the food where we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="5.611">out to eat it&amp;#39;s too expensive and we</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="5">know that restaurant prices they have</text>
  <text start="266.53" dur="6.9">been rising we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation now</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="5.889">so the price index for food away from</text>
  <text start="273.43" dur="4.769">home a subcategory in the consumer price</text>
  <text start="275.919" dur="7.081">index increased by two to three percent</text>
  <text start="278.199" dur="6.661">every year since 2012 in January it rose</text>
  <text start="283" dur="4.139">two-point-four percent year-over-year so</text>
  <text start="284.86" dur="6.149">we can see inflation is taking hold</text>
  <text start="287.139" dur="6.15">right now grocery stores well they</text>
  <text start="291.009" dur="6.291">aren&amp;#39;t reporting blockbuster numbers</text>
  <text start="293.289" dur="7.38">either and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="7.089">people are not spending the money in</text>
  <text start="300.669" dur="6.86">supermarkets they&amp;#39;re purchasing exactly</text>
  <text start="304.389" dur="5.131">what they need so in a most recent</text>
  <text start="307.529" dur="5.051">restaurant Performance Index the</text>
  <text start="309.52" dur="3.739">National Restaurant Association said</text>
  <text start="312.58" dur="3.119">this</text>
  <text start="313.259" dur="5.83">same-store sales and customer traffic</text>
  <text start="315.699" dur="7.11">readings in December well those have</text>
  <text start="319.089" dur="6.66">declined they are contracting for the</text>
  <text start="322.809" dur="4.44">third month in a row forty-two percent</text>
  <text start="325.749" dur="3.051">of operator said they&amp;#39;re same-store</text>
  <text start="327.249" dur="3.39">sales declined year-over-year</text>
  <text start="328.8" dur="3.459">forty-seven percent of the operator said</text>
  <text start="330.639" dur="4.17">their customer traffic decline</text>
  <text start="332.259" dur="6.09">year-over-year so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="334.809" dur="5.79">right now is that things are continually</text>
  <text start="338.349" dur="5.641">declining they haven&amp;#39;t improved and as</text>
  <text start="340.599" dur="6.6">inflation hits well that means your</text>
  <text start="343.99" dur="4.59">currency is devalued which is going to</text>
  <text start="347.199" dur="6.18">make it harder and harder for people</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="7.559">because we know wages are declining so</text>
  <text start="353.379" dur="4.76">we see that the national association of</text>
  <text start="356.139" dur="6">realtors while they were out there and</text>
  <text start="358.139" dur="5.83">my good buddy larry young who&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="362.139" dur="4.351">chief economist of national association</text>
  <text start="363.969" dur="3.72">of realtors said that existing home</text>
  <text start="366.49" dur="3.569">sales while they jumped</text>
  <text start="367.689" dur="5.48">three-point-three percent well above the</text>
  <text start="370.059" dur="5.521">one point one percent consent consensus</text>
  <text start="373.169" dur="4.99">well last month they dropped by one</text>
  <text start="375.58" dur="4.799">point six percent so where do they</text>
  <text start="378.159" dur="5.49">really go well they&amp;#39;re bouncing around</text>
  <text start="380.379" dur="5.04">zero because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="383.649" dur="3.66">existing home sales they haven&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="385.419" dur="4.2">moved anywhere but what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="387.309" dur="6.78">about all of this is there&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="389.619" dur="7.47">disconnect between the existing home</text>
  <text start="394.089" dur="5.7">sales and mortgage applications because</text>
  <text start="397.089" dur="4.95">mortgage applications they have tumbled</text>
  <text start="399.789" dur="4.73">in recent weeks the prior week they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="402.039" dur="5.28">tumbled around three point seven percent</text>
  <text start="404.519" dur="7.87">this week they tumbled negative two</text>
  <text start="407.319" dur="7.62">points to point zero percent so someone</text>
  <text start="412.389" dur="5.07">is lying once again and if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="414.939" dur="4.83">noticed over time every time we have a</text>
  <text start="417.459" dur="5.16">decline in existing home sales we have a</text>
  <text start="419.769" dur="5.37">little bit of a pop to even out what is</text>
  <text start="422.619" dur="4.08">happening but there&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="425.139" dur="3">disconnect to the mortgage application</text>
  <text start="426.699" dur="5.07">and what&amp;#39;s even more interesting than</text>
  <text start="428.139" dur="5.88">that home builder Toll Brothers well</text>
  <text start="431.769" dur="5.16">they posted a three point eight percent</text>
  <text start="434.019" dur="7.23">full and quarterly profits for their new</text>
  <text start="436.929" dur="9.36">homes so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that this</text>
  <text start="441.249" dur="6.48">illusion is falling apart</text>
  <text start="446.289" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s going to rapidly fall apart as we</text>
  <text start="447.729" dur="4.53">move ahead now the corporate media</text>
  <text start="450.219" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared of course to</text>
  <text start="452.259" dur="5.09">blame this on the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="454.99" dur="5.789">they weren&amp;#39;t going to blame it on Obama</text>
  <text start="457.349" dur="5.71">they were lockstep with his recovery</text>
  <text start="460.779" dur="4.41">narrative they were telling you how</text>
  <text start="463.059" dur="4.021">great everything was and we were looking</text>
  <text start="465.189" dur="4.671">at all the economic hard data showing</text>
  <text start="467.08" dur="6.299">that this economy never recovered at all</text>
  <text start="469.86" dur="5.949">completely impossible the numbers were</text>
  <text start="473.379" dur="4.831">manipulated statistics were manipulated</text>
  <text start="475.809" dur="4.051">but he didn&amp;#39;t recover so now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.21" dur="5.009">making the case that because of trumps</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="8.16">immigration ban this is going to cause</text>
  <text start="483.219" dur="8.37">another housing crash now remember the</text>
  <text start="488.02" dur="6.479">ban is for illegal immigrants actually</text>
  <text start="491.589" dur="5.82">those who are a threat right now to the</text>
  <text start="494.499" dur="6.06">United States maybe couldn&amp;#39;t committed a</text>
  <text start="497.409" dur="6.59">crime you know or anything like that but</text>
  <text start="500.559" dur="7.32">everyday legal immigrants guess what</text>
  <text start="503.999" dur="5.741">they&amp;#39;re not affected by any of this but</text>
  <text start="507.879" dur="4.981">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.74" dur="5.969">trying to link everything to show this</text>
  <text start="512.86" dur="7.01">is why the economy is going to fall</text>
  <text start="515.709" dur="8.341">apart now very interestingly Trump</text>
  <text start="519.87" dur="6.04">warned that America&amp;#39;s spending and</text>
  <text start="524.05" dur="5.099">that&amp;#39;s the government spending is out of</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="6.479">control officials gathered to discuss</text>
  <text start="529.149" dur="4.68">the budget and when they looked at the</text>
  <text start="532.389" dur="5.551">national debt when they looked at the</text>
  <text start="533.829" dur="9.24">budget guess what well he says the</text>
  <text start="537.94" dur="6.959">budget is absolutely out of control the</text>
  <text start="543.069" dur="4.5">hiring freeze for non-essential workers</text>
  <text start="544.899" dur="6.24">will remain we have an enormous work to</text>
  <text start="547.569" dur="11.341">do on the national debt and the economy</text>
  <text start="551.139" dur="11.94">is reeling from all of this but the</text>
  <text start="558.91" dur="8.31">corporate media is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="563.079" dur="6.69">making a case where the economy is</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="5.01">worsening now now go back a couple of</text>
  <text start="569.769" dur="6.63">reports i talked about how the corporate</text>
  <text start="572.23" dur="7.169">media is going to actually verify that</text>
  <text start="576.399" dur="3.211">the economy is not doing well and hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="579.399" dur="3.81">been</text>
  <text start="579.61" dur="7.46">well because during in a discussion</text>
  <text start="583.209" dur="8.37">between mika brzezinski and scarborough</text>
  <text start="587.07" dur="7.24">they were talking about how Trump is</text>
  <text start="591.579" dur="7.081">going to be using alternative facts and</text>
  <text start="594.31" dur="6.3">how he&amp;#39;s going to be controlling what</text>
  <text start="598.66" dur="5.34">people think and of course she said this</text>
  <text start="600.61" dur="6.33">is our job but within all of this she</text>
  <text start="604" dur="8.07">talked about how the economy is</text>
  <text start="606.94" dur="8.28">worsening and he she said he could</text>
  <text start="612.07" dur="4.949">undermine the message so much that he</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="6.059">can actually control exactly what people</text>
  <text start="617.019" dur="6.151">think in regards to the economy now</text>
  <text start="621.279" dur="4.081">think about what&amp;#39;s happening here we</text>
  <text start="623.17" dur="4.109">already have Janet Yellen saying listen</text>
  <text start="625.36" dur="4.26">the economy is disappointing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="627.279" dur="4.68">weakening but when things start to</text>
  <text start="629.62" dur="4.56">rapidly fall apart do not blame the Fed</text>
  <text start="631.959" dur="5.161">we have the corporate media out there</text>
  <text start="634.18" dur="6.54">saying that his immigration band well</text>
  <text start="637.12" dur="6.57">that could be a reason why housing might</text>
  <text start="640.72" dur="5.07">crash well we know for a fact that is</text>
  <text start="643.69" dur="5.339">not the reason why housing is going to</text>
  <text start="645.79" dur="5.789">crash because we know that housing has</text>
  <text start="649.029" dur="5.25">been pumped up in 22 cities with</text>
  <text start="651.579" dur="4.771">investment companies hedge funds foreign</text>
  <text start="654.279" dur="4.021">investors paying for these houses in</text>
  <text start="656.35" dur="3.96">cash the American person is on the</text>
  <text start="658.3" dur="3.96">sidelines we can tell by the mortgage</text>
  <text start="660.31" dur="6.48">application and all the people have been</text>
  <text start="662.26" dur="9">laid off in these banks so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="666.79" dur="6.93">making a complete story out of how the</text>
  <text start="671.26" dur="5.16">economy is starting to worsen and</text>
  <text start="673.72" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re worried about how he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="676.42" dur="5.88">use alternative facts to show that the</text>
  <text start="678.85" dur="6.72">economy is not doing as bad as they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="682.3" dur="7.95">reporting so they&amp;#39;re going to show us</text>
  <text start="685.57" dur="10.73">how bad the economy is and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="690.25" dur="10.35">already started to do it now remember</text>
  <text start="696.3" dur="6.07">they talked about alternative facts well</text>
  <text start="700.6" dur="4.679">if we go back to two thousand eight and</text>
  <text start="702.37" dur="4.2">subprime securities those few</text>
  <text start="705.279" dur="3.331">individuals that looked at these</text>
  <text start="706.57" dur="5.129">subprime securities and look inside and</text>
  <text start="708.61" dur="4.5">said we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute I&amp;#39;m looking at</text>
  <text start="711.699" dur="1.83">this and I see all the people that have</text>
  <text start="713.11" dur="2.039">these</text>
  <text start="713.529" dur="5.16">mortgages and most of them defaulting</text>
  <text start="715.149" dur="5.701">and the rating agencies are saying that</text>
  <text start="718.689" dur="5.76">these are triple-a but when I&amp;#39;m looking</text>
  <text start="720.85" dur="8.64">at them I have an alternative fact that</text>
  <text start="724.449" dur="6.481">says these are garbage now of course the</text>
  <text start="729.49" dur="6">hundreds and hundreds of millions of</text>
  <text start="730.93" dur="7.8">people say well that&amp;#39;s wrong the rating</text>
  <text start="735.49" dur="7.11">agencies said well that&amp;#39;s wrong we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="738.73" dur="8.19">believe in alternative facts we believe</text>
  <text start="742.6" dur="6.929">in our facts well these individuals had</text>
  <text start="746.92" dur="5.609">an alternative they were showing that</text>
