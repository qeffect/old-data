  <text start="50.39" dur="4.8">news now we have been watching the</text>
  <text start="52.76" dur="4.44">market we&amp;#39;ve been watching gold and we</text>
  <text start="55.19" dur="4.74">can see gold is on the move once again</text>
  <text start="57.2" dur="5.429">the market is flat today not really</text>
  <text start="59.93" dur="6.36">moving up or down not really moving</text>
  <text start="62.629" dur="5.521">anywhere and this is going to continue</text>
  <text start="66.29" dur="3.84">on like this where gold is going to</text>
  <text start="68.15" dur="4.35">continually make more and more new highs</text>
  <text start="70.13" dur="5.25">and most likely the market is going to</text>
  <text start="72.5" dur="7.68">stay flat because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="75.38" dur="7.59">that this system that the government the</text>
  <text start="80.18" dur="8.69">central bankers have created its run its</text>
  <text start="82.97" dur="7.95">course everything is a complete illusion</text>
  <text start="88.87" dur="7.14">what&amp;#39;s really happening in the economy</text>
  <text start="90.92" dur="7.62">is it&amp;#39;s deteriorating on all sectors and</text>
  <text start="96.01" dur="4.6">we get these reports that come out</text>
  <text start="98.54" dur="5.49">letting us know that the job market is</text>
  <text start="100.61" dur="6.72">good we&amp;#39;re getting information that</text>
  <text start="104.03" dur="6.81">hiring is rebounding that there are more</text>
  <text start="107.33" dur="5.67">open positions now and I&amp;#39;ve explained</text>
  <text start="110.84" dur="5.99">this before because the jolt survey came</text>
  <text start="113" dur="5.73">out that showed that in June and</text>
  <text start="116.83" dur="4.63">remember this report is one month</text>
  <text start="118.73" dur="4.71">delayed to the payrolls report the</text>
  <text start="121.46" dur="6.859">number of jobs opening rebounded from a</text>
  <text start="123.44" dur="7.769">revised 5.5 14 million to 5.6 24 million</text>
  <text start="128.319" dur="6.241">missing the expectations of 5.6 75</text>
  <text start="131.209" dur="7.89">million but what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="134.56" dur="8.649">that hiring is actually slowing right</text>
  <text start="139.099" dur="6">now compared to a year ago and because</text>
  <text start="143.209" dur="4.64">we have open positions doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="145.099" dur="5.881">companies are going to actually hire</text>
  <text start="147.849" dur="5.801">because what they do is they keep these</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="6.81">open rex they tell people to interview</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="6.69">but never to fulfill the jobs because</text>
  <text start="157.79" dur="5.97">each department if they just say alright</text>
  <text start="160.34" dur="3.96">we don&amp;#39;t need this wreck because they</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="3.09">won&amp;#39;t let us</text>
  <text start="164.3" dur="5.13">higher they&amp;#39;ll never get it back this is</text>
  <text start="166.85" dur="3.93">how the department see this so they keep</text>
  <text start="169.43" dur="3.36">the open wreck they keep interviewing</text>
  <text start="170.78" dur="4.86">the people but from the top they tell</text>
  <text start="172.79" dur="4.74">them listen you can do all this but</text>
  <text start="175.64" dur="3.71">we&amp;#39;re on a hiring freeze right now but</text>
  <text start="177.53" dur="5.66">we do have all these open positions</text>
  <text start="179.35" dur="6.43">which is again fake phony and false and</text>
  <text start="183.19" dur="6.22">what we&amp;#39;re looking at is we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="185.78" dur="7.35">before back in 2008 it looks like the</text>
  <text start="189.41" dur="6.99">employment market peaked at a certain</text>
  <text start="193.13" dur="6.75">level and that was back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="196.4" dur="8.1">six going into 2007 the market came</text>
  <text start="199.88" dur="7.86">crashing down if we fast forward to 2014</text>
  <text start="204.5" dur="5.79">2015 we see the same thing we see the</text>
  <text start="207.74" dur="6.3">same exact pattern and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="210.29" dur="6.69">system is mimicking what happened back</text>
  <text start="214.04" dur="7.14">in two thousand eight we&amp;#39;re headed for a</text>
  <text start="216.98" dur="6.87">disaster now bank of america came out</text>
  <text start="221.18" dur="6.03">with a report showing that the american</text>
  <text start="223.85" dur="6.45">people they&amp;#39;re just tapped out spending</text>
  <text start="227.21" dur="5.249">is slowing now friday we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="230.3" dur="4.35">the retail sales report it will be</text>
  <text start="232.459" dur="4.761">released but when we look at the bank of</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="6.089">america report ahead of time here on</text>
  <text start="237.22" dur="5.47">their credit and debit card data they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.739" dur="5.851">showing that consumer spending slowed in</text>
  <text start="242.69" dur="7.019">july with retail sales x autos are down</text>
  <text start="246.59" dur="5.79">by 0.3% month on month and these again</text>
  <text start="249.709" dur="6.991">are seasonally adjusted so this is a lot</text>
  <text start="252.38" dur="8.579">worse and this follows the flat pace in</text>
  <text start="256.7" dur="7.83">june for retail sales now when the</text>
  <text start="260.959" dur="8.071">retail sales report comes out tomorrow i</text>
  <text start="264.53" dur="7.82">mean friday most likely it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="269.03" dur="7.11">show that spending is decreasing and</text>
  <text start="272.35" dur="6.7">when we look at this we see that that</text>
  <text start="276.14" dur="6.57">fast food has been slowing since the</text>
  <text start="279.05" dur="7.98">recession it is growing at a slower pace</text>
  <text start="282.71" dur="7.44">and it looks like people are not going</text>
  <text start="287.03" dur="7.08">out to eat as much the other thing that</text>
  <text start="290.15" dur="6.87">we see slowing is spending on home</text>
  <text start="294.11" dur="4.05">improvement and home goods now</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="3.15">traditionally this is</text>
  <text start="298.16" dur="3.87">the most visible concurrent and slightly</text>
  <text start="300.17" dur="4.77">lagging indicator to the US housing</text>
  <text start="302.03" dur="5.67">sector sales at home improvement stores</text>
  <text start="304.94" dur="6.45">tumbled in July and they were down three</text>
  <text start="307.7" dur="4.89">point four percent year-on-year now</text>
  <text start="311.39" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;re going to have to wait for the</text>
  <text start="312.59" dur="3.48">retail sales report to come out we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="314.87" dur="3.45">see what the spending is and of course</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="5.76">most of the time the government will add</text>
  <text start="318.32" dur="5.16">in multiple seasonal adjustments to pump</text>
  <text start="321.83" dur="4.65">the numbers up to where they need them</text>
  <text start="323.48" dur="4.71">to go but when we look at it we will</text>
  <text start="326.48" dur="3.51">know right off the bat because we will</text>
  <text start="328.19" dur="4.41">cut through all of that and find out the</text>
  <text start="329.99" dur="5.46">truth of what people are actually doing</text>
  <text start="332.6" dur="6.63">now this report is showing people are</text>
  <text start="335.45" dur="6.27">using their debit credit cards mostly</text>
  <text start="339.23" dur="4.44">credit cards because many people just</text>
  <text start="341.72" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t have the cash to go out and</text>
  <text start="343.67" dur="4.08">purchase goods and it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="346.1" dur="4.47">harder and harder as time goes on</text>
  <text start="347.75" dur="7.44">because in today&amp;#39;s world most of the</text>
  <text start="350.57" dur="8.55">people are living on credit if you took</text>
  <text start="355.19" dur="6.3">away the credit cards today most people</text>
  <text start="359.12" dur="5.16">would not be able to survive most people</text>
  <text start="361.49" dur="6.57">would not be able to buy their food they</text>
  <text start="364.28" dur="7.35">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to make it and this</text>
  <text start="368.06" dur="6.42">shows us that this economy can&amp;#39;t move</text>
  <text start="371.63" dur="6.84">forward like this it&amp;#39;s impossible it</text>
  <text start="374.48" dur="6.51">cannot work even the post office they</text>
  <text start="378.47" dur="5.19">have been in trouble for a very long</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="5.28">time and the US Postal Service in the</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="8.45">third quarter they came out with their</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="8.82">numbers they have lost 1.6 billion</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="5.5">they&amp;#39;re going to need a bailout and if</text>
  <text start="395.09" dur="5.19">we look at everything everything is</text>
  <text start="397.61" dur="5.43">going to need a ban a bailout Fannie and</text>
  <text start="400.28" dur="4.68">Freddie if there&amp;#39;s a crisis they need a</text>
  <text start="403.04" dur="4.49">bailout the Postal Service needs a bail</text>
  <text start="404.96" dur="4.86">out the banks are going to need bail ins</text>
  <text start="407.53" dur="5.11">because they we know they can&amp;#39;t whether</text>
  <text start="409.82" dur="7.2">a financial crisis they have no cash on</text>
  <text start="412.64" dur="10.05">hand and another problem is public</text>
  <text start="417.02" dur="9.03">public pensions a report came out and it</text>
  <text start="422.69" dur="5.55">was released which pointed out that the</text>

  <text start="446.72" dur="4.02">know that&amp;#39;s completely impossible and</text>
  <text start="448.72" dur="6.449">they&amp;#39;re going to have to readjust this</text>
  <text start="450.74" dur="6.959">to a four percent or lower return and</text>
  <text start="455.169" dur="4.75">I&amp;#39;m going to go with the lower side but</text>
  <text start="457.699" dur="6.87">let&amp;#39;s be conservative and say it&amp;#39;s four</text>
