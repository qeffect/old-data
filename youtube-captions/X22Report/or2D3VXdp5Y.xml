  <text start="27.359" dur="4.721">hi and welcome to the x 22 report my</text>
  <text start="30.039" dur="4.261">name is dave and this is episode 100 and</text>
  <text start="32.08" dur="4.319">title of this episode is the damn is</text>
  <text start="34.3" dur="4.65">about to burst and nobody can stop it</text>
  <text start="36.399" dur="5.16">well basically the world right now is in</text>
  <text start="38.95" dur="5.1">crisis mode Europe is having problems</text>
  <text start="41.559" dur="5.101">the Mideast is having problems Japan is</text>
  <text start="44.05" dur="4.829">having problems and the United States</text>
  <text start="46.66" dur="7.859">everything is perfect here so we have</text>
  <text start="48.879" dur="8.011">nothing to worry about and basically the</text>
  <text start="54.519" dur="5.88">illusion and everything that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="56.89" dur="6.149">here people really don&amp;#39;t realize the</text>
  <text start="60.399" dur="5.341">problems that are occurring because the</text>
  <text start="63.039" dur="6.271">news just doesn&amp;#39;t you know report on</text>
  <text start="65.74" dur="6.39">them and basically since banks are</text>
  <text start="69.31" dur="5.849">losing tons of money the only way they</text>
  <text start="72.13" dur="7.02">know how to recoup and make money is by</text>
  <text start="75.159" dur="8.1">using fees so what the major banks are</text>
  <text start="79.15" dur="8.46">doing now and these are the big Wall</text>
  <text start="83.259" dur="7.381">Street banks they and these banks</text>
  <text start="87.61" dur="4.95">consider consist of JPMorgan Chase Bank</text>
  <text start="90.64" dur="8.96">of America Wells Fargo and Citigroup</text>
  <text start="92.56" dur="12.419">they are starting to use basically a</text>
  <text start="99.6" dur="8.229">payroll bank cards and paying people on</text>
  <text start="104.979" dur="7.111">these cards so it&amp;#39;s basically like</text>
  <text start="107.829" dur="6.72">paying people on a gift card and they</text>
  <text start="112.09" dur="5.61">control the accounts and every time you</text>
  <text start="114.549" dur="5.371">use them there&amp;#39;s a fee every time you go</text>
  <text start="117.7" dur="5.279">to draw every time that you want a paper</text>
  <text start="119.92" dur="6.449">statement every time you lose your card</text>
  <text start="122.979" dur="6.091">there&amp;#39;s fee fee fee fee fee and on these</text>
  <text start="126.369" dur="6.511">low end employees who work at Walmart</text>
  <text start="129.07" dur="6.72">Home Depot walgreens Taco Bell most of</text>
  <text start="132.88" dur="3.93">these fees are larger than what they</text>
  <text start="135.79" dur="4.199">make or</text>
  <text start="136.81" dur="5.88">a road what they make and they end up</text>
  <text start="139.989" dur="5.491">making even less from getting their</text>
  <text start="142.69" dur="5.67">payment this way and for some it might</text>
  <text start="145.48" dur="6.06">be easier and better but in the long run</text>
  <text start="148.36" dur="6.3">by continually using this they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="7.559">going to tack on fie upon fie upon fee</text>
  <text start="154.66" dur="7.439">and basically here are some examples of</text>
  <text start="159.099" dur="6.271">what those fees are and they quickly add</text>
  <text start="162.099" dur="6.691">up when you use them like a dollar 75 to</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="6.06">make a withdrawal from most atms 295 for</text>
  <text start="168.79" dur="6.21">a paper statement six dollars to replace</text>
  <text start="171.43" dur="6.42">a card some years some users who have</text>
  <text start="175" dur="5.819">these payroll cards have to pay seven</text>
  <text start="177.85" dur="6.81">dollars inactivity fees for not using</text>
  <text start="180.819" dur="7.14">their cars their cards so we can see how</text>
  <text start="184.66" dur="6.9">this is the new norm coming into the</text>
  <text start="187.959" dur="6.121">system and basically targeted for those</text>
  <text start="191.56" dur="6.09">people who are not making that much</text>
  <text start="194.08" dur="8.52">money and for the little that they make</text>
  <text start="197.65" dur="8.1">the big Wall Street banks are basically</text>
  <text start="202.6" dur="4.68">raping them with all these fees and if</text>
  <text start="205.75" dur="4.59">you notice even with checking and</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="5.51">savings and all this the fees have</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="7.8">gotten completely out of control and</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="7.75">bakes are are trying to make up for all</text>
  <text start="218.14" dur="6.599">of their losses and all of their bad</text>
  <text start="220.54" dur="5.99">investments by charging everyone a fee</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="5.671">now I remember there was a time that</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="8.079">when you opened up an account he would</text>
  <text start="230.41" dur="6.06">get a TV a toaster or something with a</text>
  <text start="234.609" dur="5.121">certain of money that you deposit into</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="6.54">that account today you see none of this</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="6.4">they used to reward you for opening</text>
  <text start="243.01" dur="5.91">account they used to reward you with no</text>
  <text start="246.13" dur="5.22">fees they used to reward you with some</text>
  <text start="248.92" dur="5.159">type of gift of saying thank you for</text>
  <text start="251.35" dur="5.16">putting your money and your trust in our</text>
  <text start="254.079" dur="5.551">bank but all those small banks and all</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="6.18">those mom-and-pop type of banks are all</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="5.43">completely gone or almost all completely</text>
  <text start="262.69" dur="5.7">gone and now the big Wall Street banks</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="5.109">have taken over and they are just raping</text>
  <text start="268.39" dur="4.389">everyone with read</text>
  <text start="270.169" dur="4.351">oculus fees for everything you do</text>
  <text start="272.779" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s a fee if you blink if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="274.52" dur="4.41">fee if you look at your account there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.319" dur="5.041">a fee if you click on this button so it</text>
  <text start="278.93" dur="5.37">really is getting out of hand and I said</text>
  <text start="281.36" dur="5.88">this back in my other episodes when you</text>
  <text start="284.3" dur="5.82">are when the people start getting taxed</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="5.489">and there are more laws more regulations</text>
  <text start="290.12" dur="5.28">and more is taken from you we are</text>
  <text start="292.729" dur="5.851">getting closer to the collapse because</text>
  <text start="295.4" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re just scraping at the bottom of</text>
  <text start="298.58" dur="4.769">the barrel trying to get whatever they</text>
  <text start="300.8" dur="6.06">possibly can before everything</text>
  <text start="303.349" dur="6.481">completely falls apart okay let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="6.229">on here now the job report from ATP came</text>
  <text start="309.83" dur="7.739">out and they said they added 188,000</text>
  <text start="313.089" dur="9.85">jobs but as we always know that these</text>
  <text start="317.569" dur="7.831">jobs are always revised and basically it</text>
  <text start="322.939" dur="5.97">really is meaningless because if you</text>
  <text start="325.4" dur="5.129">look at what the real job numbers are</text>
  <text start="328.909" dur="4.32">and you look at the potential people</text>
  <text start="330.529" dur="5.221">that are out of work it&amp;#39;s around twenty</text>
  <text start="333.229" dur="4.47">three percent because they have changed</text>
  <text start="335.75" dur="6.569">the calculation of unemployment and if</text>
  <text start="337.699" dur="6.69">you&amp;#39;d like to see the real calculation</text>
  <text start="342.319" dur="4.611">that they used before they changed</text>
  <text start="344.389" dur="7.981">everything you can go to shadow stats</text>
  <text start="346.93" dur="8.5">calm and on that site he shows you right</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="4.68">on the front page or you might have to</text>
  <text start="355.43" dur="3.659">go up to the top link and choose</text>
  <text start="357.05" dur="5.339">unemployment GDP or an inflation and</text>
  <text start="359.089" dur="6.17">they will shows you what the</text>
  <text start="362.389" dur="6.51">government&amp;#39;s unemployment is compared to</text>
  <text start="365.259" dur="7.21">the old calculation of how they used to</text>
  <text start="368.899" dur="7.61">do the unemployment and that is hovering</text>
  <text start="372.469" dur="6.301">around twenty three percent or so now</text>
  <text start="376.509" dur="4.511">France wants to temporarily suspend</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="5.1">trade talks with the u.s. over NSA</text>
  <text start="381.02" dur="5.31">spying now of course they do because</text>
  <text start="383.87" dur="3.779">they don&amp;#39;t know what information the</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="4.799">United States government learned about</text>
  <text start="387.649" dur="7.77">this and how can this deal be honest</text>
  <text start="391.129" dur="6.87">between two nations between many nations</text>
  <text start="395.419" dur="4.59">and it basically goes on to say frame</text>
  <text start="397.999" dur="4.111">once France wants to delay the biggest</text>
  <text start="400.009" dur="3.751">bilateral trade deal in history by two</text>
  <text start="402.11" dur="4.77">weeks after learning the u.s.</text>
  <text start="403.76" dur="6.96">a has allegedly been tracking economic</text>
  <text start="406.88" dur="7.31">communications of EU member states and</text>
  <text start="410.72" dur="6.78">again if they are all in this together</text>
  <text start="414.19" dur="5.92">why would they need to spy the only</text>
  <text start="417.5" dur="6.05">reason you do this is to getting it to</text>
  <text start="420.11" dur="7.95">get an advantage over someone else and</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="7.35">basically the EU states are realizing</text>
  <text start="428.06" dur="4.77">this and they&amp;#39;re putting the Holt on</text>
  <text start="430.9" dur="5.55">everything they&amp;#39;re saying whoa whoa whoa</text>
  <text start="432.83" dur="7.2">let&amp;#39;s stop here now Portugal and Greece</text>
  <text start="436.45" dur="6.39">are now vying to be this week&amp;#39;s crisis</text>
  <text start="440.03" dur="5.85">in Europe we&amp;#39;ve had Cyprus which was</text>
  <text start="442.84" dur="5.38">downgraded by S&amp;amp;P and moody&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="445.88" dur="4.46">recently had been pushed back up to I</text>
  <text start="448.22" dur="5.49">believe a triple c or negative Triple C</text>
  <text start="450.34" dur="5.83">after they did their debt exchange you</text>
  <text start="453.71" dur="4.83">know because they have longer maturities</text>
  <text start="456.17" dur="4.14">on their debt but they still have the</text>
  <text start="458.54" dur="3.99">dead and they&amp;#39;ll be taking on some more</text>
  <text start="460.31" dur="4.59">debt because when you have for some</text>
  <text start="462.53" dur="3.96">reason credit agencies love when you</text>
  <text start="464.9" dur="4.14">have lots of debt and you&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="466.49" dur="5.01">those payments on tons and tons of debt</text>
  <text start="469.04" dur="4.8">and they think you&amp;#39;re a good risk see I</text>
  <text start="471.5" dur="4.23">think it was the opposite you have so</text>
  <text start="473.84" dur="4.14">much debt you&amp;#39;re barely getting by and</text>
  <text start="475.73" dur="6.12">making the minimum payment you&amp;#39;re a bad</text>
  <text start="477.98" dur="6.93">risk because anything can set off you</text>
  <text start="481.85" dur="5.31">defaulting on everything I rather have</text>
  <text start="484.91" dur="4.47">someone that has no debt that pays off</text>
  <text start="487.16" dur="6.69">someone you know that pays off</text>
  <text start="489.38" dur="6.9">everything completely on time and has no</text>
  <text start="493.85" dur="7.29">debt that that to me is a very good risk</text>
  <text start="496.28" dur="8.13">this basically it just shows you hmm who</text>
  <text start="501.14" dur="5.22">can we give the most debt to and who are</text>
  <text start="504.41" dur="7.95">these people that would just go ahead</text>
  <text start="506.36" dur="8.58">and scrape by and worry about making</text>
  <text start="512.36" dur="4.739">their minimum payment on this huge debt</text>
  <text start="514.94" dur="4.59">load will give them a good credit rating</text>
  <text start="517.099" dur="4.711">so they can take on some more debt and</text>
  <text start="519.53" dur="4.17">who cares if they can feed their family</text>
  <text start="521.81" dur="3.39">or not as long as we know they&amp;#39;ll make</text>
  <text start="523.7" dur="4.35">that minimum payment because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="525.2" dur="4.2">worried that&amp;#39;s the people we need and it</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="5.1">feels like they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="529.4" dur="7.29">with the countries the countries with</text>
  <text start="533.15" dur="4.56">more and more debt get great credit</text>
  <text start="536.69" dur="3.69">ratings</text>
  <text start="537.71" dur="5.58">look at the u.s. I mean the biggest</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="7.08">debtor nation and I hate saying that the</text>
  <text start="543.29" dur="6.66">United States has 17 trillion worth of</text>
  <text start="547.46" dur="4.41">debt actually it&amp;#39;s more if you count in</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="5.64">all the other stuff but let&amp;#39;s just use</text>
  <text start="551.87" dur="8.7">17 trillion 17 trillion dollars and</text>
  <text start="555.59" dur="8.85">their credit they&amp;#39;re the the rating from</text>
  <text start="560.57" dur="6.12">these credit agencies is very high but</text>
  <text start="564.44" dur="6.03">any little thing can set it off in the</text>
  <text start="566.69" dur="6.75">oil it becomes defaulted on and all this</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="6.78">debt can&amp;#39;t be repaid it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="573.44" dur="7.29">to me whatsoever but this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="577.25" dur="6.33">that Portugal and Greece they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="580.73" dur="7.53">very tough times unemployment is very</text>
  <text start="583.58" dur="7.77">very high and this is spreading</text>
  <text start="588.26" dur="4.65">throughout Europe it&amp;#39;s Cypress I mean</text>
  <text start="591.35" dur="3.75">they can pretend they can move the</text>
  <text start="592.91" dur="5.07">credit ratings up or down these are the</text>
  <text start="595.1" dur="5.1">same credit rating agencies that were</text>
  <text start="597.98" dur="6.12">telling us that these you know the real</text>
  <text start="600.2" dur="7.41">estate subprime security bundles were</text>
  <text start="604.1" dur="8.09">triple-a and everything was great and</text>
  <text start="607.61" dur="7.62">they had him at these triple-a scores</text>
  <text start="612.19" dur="5.2">even when the default even when the</text>
  <text start="615.23" dur="7.17">collapse was happening to me they they</text>
  <text start="617.39" dur="8.07">still had him at these great ratings</text>
  <text start="622.4" dur="5.13">even though like Goldman Sachs as they</text>
  <text start="625.46" dur="3.39">were selling these things to people they</text>
  <text start="627.53" dur="6.48">were betting against it because they</text>
  <text start="628.85" dur="8.85">knew it was crap okay let&amp;#39;s move on here</text>
  <text start="634.01" dur="6.42">now SMP talking about movies and SP and</text>
  <text start="637.7" dur="4.08">all these credit ratings agencies SMP</text>
  <text start="640.43" dur="5.01">cut the ratings on deutsche bank</text>
  <text start="641.78" dur="7.88">barclays and credit swiss and they drop</text>
  <text start="645.44" dur="6.72">them basically from a plus to an A and</text>
  <text start="649.66" dur="5.38">they probably should be much further</text>
  <text start="652.16" dur="7.8">down but you know this is how it begins</text>
  <text start="655.04" dur="8.25">and again who can trust what SP has to</text>
  <text start="659.96" dur="5.01">say they are all kind of folded SMP kind</text>
  <text start="663.29" dur="3.93">of folded when the United States</text>
  <text start="664.97" dur="6.03">government sue them and they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="667.22" dur="4.05">give because SP downgraded the United</text>
  <text start="671" dur="2.88">State</text>
  <text start="671.27" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s the first time and United States</text>
  <text start="673.88" dur="5.55">from stop stop them from downgrading</text>
  <text start="676.25" dur="8.69">them a second time by suing them and</text>
  <text start="679.43" dur="8.19">basically just bathing give a rating but</text>
  <text start="684.94" dur="7.75">now Obamacare we talked a lot about</text>
  <text start="687.62" dur="9.21">Obamacare and basically they&amp;#39;re holding</text>
  <text start="692.69" dur="8.52">off on the employer mandate until 2015</text>
  <text start="696.83" dur="8.28">and this is where basically the you know</text>
  <text start="701.21" dur="5.4">the businesses how to have a certain if</text>
  <text start="705.11" dur="3.09">they went over a certain number of</text>
  <text start="706.61" dur="4.5">employees or they had certain number of</text>
  <text start="708.2" dur="6.12">hours even you take health insurance or</text>
  <text start="711.11" dur="6.92">get penalized and I basically it looks</text>
  <text start="714.32" dur="8.04">like the government the Congress Senate</text>
  <text start="718.03" dur="7.95">woke up you know reddit after the fact</text>
  <text start="722.36" dur="6.09">and basically had you know the oh</text>
  <text start="725.98" dur="5.95">look what this says here we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="728.45" dur="6.18">destroy the economy with this and the</text>
  <text start="731.93" dur="5.37">job market with this and we are not</text>
  <text start="734.63" dur="4.91">ready to do this and I believe that</text>
  <text start="737.3" dur="4.77">everyone&amp;#39;s starting to realize this and</text>
  <text start="739.54" dur="4.45">they are not ready for the collapse they</text>
  <text start="742.07" dur="4.86">still have certain things they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="743.99" dur="5.7">to accomplish and especially the Obama</text>
  <text start="746.93" dur="4.7">administration central bankers and they</text>
  <text start="749.69" dur="5.75">realized if they pass this right now</text>
  <text start="751.63" dur="6.73">everything would come crumbling down and</text>
  <text start="755.44" dur="7.9">you know they did a they&amp;#39;re so far</text>
  <text start="758.36" dur="8.31">removed from the everyday person they</text>

  <text start="1513.659" dur="7.11">already control the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1517.259" dur="6.481">five corporations own the media system</text>
  <text start="1520.769" dur="4.29">especially the Associated Press so they</text>
  <text start="1523.74" dur="3.779">have control and this goes back to</text>
  <text start="1525.059" dur="4.73">nineteen thirteen when they just weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1527.519" dur="4.801">going to control the monetary system</text>
  <text start="1529.789" dur="5.411">they&amp;#39;re also need to control the flow of</text>

  <text start="1535.2" dur="6.599">they you know couldn&amp;#39;t foresee this</text>
  <text start="1537.659" dur="8.13">happening the internet is like the Wild</text>
  <text start="1541.799" dur="6.75">West they have no control over it they</text>
  <text start="1545.789" dur="6">have no control of other alternative</text>
  <text start="1548.549" dur="5.88">news media outlets channels opening up</text>

  <text start="1554.429" dur="8.1">different sides to the same story they</text>
  <text start="1557.72" dur="8.399">do not like this they need to control it</text>
  <text start="1562.529" dur="9.6">this is why they have continually</text>
  <text start="1566.119" dur="8.471">reintroduced sista into the government</text>
  <text start="1572.129" dur="4.561">and now it&amp;#39;s pending again in the Senate</text>
  <text start="1574.59" dur="4.549">waiting for something to happen they</text>
  <text start="1576.69" dur="5.67">would like to shut down the internet</text>
  <text start="1579.139" dur="5.831">altogether as discussed in previous</text>
  <text start="1582.36" dur="5.909">episode they have already created a</text>
  <text start="1584.97" dur="5.13">separate system that the government</text>
  <text start="1588.269" dur="5.221">would use a separate internet which is</text>
  <text start="1590.1" dur="4.949">wireless running on a 4G network and if</text>
  <text start="1593.49" dur="3.12">you go back to I think there&amp;#39;s maybe six</text>
  <text start="1595.049" dur="4.83">or seven episodes or five or something</text>
  <text start="1596.61" dur="6.72">like that back there was a news report</text>
  <text start="1599.879" dur="6.061">on this and it would be encrypted and</text>
  <text start="1603.33" dur="3.39">separate and apart from the internet so</text>
  <text start="1605.94" dur="3.15">they have no problem</text>
  <text start="1606.72" dur="5.52">shutting down the internet because they</text>
  <text start="1609.09" dur="9.36">have something already established they</text>
  <text start="1612.24" dur="9.299">don&amp;#39;t want people out there making it</text>
  <text start="1618.45" dur="5.49">harder for them to carry on false lags</text>
  <text start="1621.539" dur="5.101">like for instance Boston bombing there</text>
  <text start="1623.94" dur="4.859">were too many pictures they shut the</text>
  <text start="1626.64" dur="4.89">cell phones off which they really let</text>
  <text start="1628.799" dur="4.921">them off they shot the cell towers off</text>
  <text start="1631.53" dur="4.17">so people couldn&amp;#39;t transfer information</text>
  <text start="1633.72" dur="4.28">back and forth what they didn&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="1635.7" dur="4.77">is that when the phones are not</text>
  <text start="1638" dur="3.97">connected to the cell towers they can</text>
  <text start="1640.47" dur="3.839">still take pictures and want to turn</text>
  <text start="1641.97" dur="4.62">back on basically people were allowed to</text>
  <text start="1644.309" dur="5.25">send pictures and that&amp;#39;s why the FBI</text>
  <text start="1646.59" dur="5.85">wanted to see every picture that every</text>
  <text start="1649.559" dur="5.73">person had so they can see what story</text>
  <text start="1652.44" dur="6.119">they were going to make up for the</text>
  <text start="1655.289" dur="5.401">Boston bombing and since this time in</text>
  <text start="1658.559" dur="3.661">one of my previous episodes they came</text>
  <text start="1660.69" dur="5.82">out saying that they don&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="1662.22" dur="6.78">the cell tower killed type of action</text>
  <text start="1666.51" dur="5.07">they did from the DHS was enough it</text>
  <text start="1669" dur="5.13">would be better if they had a kill</text>
  <text start="1671.58" dur="4.979">switch on each and every person cell</text>
  <text start="1674.13" dur="7.26">phone which would make them in operable</text>
  <text start="1676.559" dur="7.411">in time of crisis and it&amp;#39;s easy to do by</text>
  <text start="1681.39" dur="4.98">just having an update in the software</text>
  <text start="1683.97" dur="4.89">download to your phone without you even</text>
  <text start="1686.37" dur="4.32">knowing that it&amp;#39;s embedded in there and</text>
  <text start="1688.86" dur="6.12">all the new phones would just you know</text>
  <text start="1690.69" dur="6.57">have it already built in and basically</text>
  <text start="1694.98" dur="4.439">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to control</text>
  <text start="1697.26" dur="4.409">they&amp;#39;re trying to warn us that cyber</text>
  <text start="1699.419" dur="4.971">attacks are coming they will hit the</text>
  <text start="1701.669" dur="7.831">banks they will hit key infrastructure</text>
  <text start="1704.39" dur="8.289">areas like water electrical nuclear plus</text>
  <text start="1709.5" dur="5.19">do we really need the internet is it</text>
  <text start="1712.679" dur="4.141">really worth having because of all the</text>
  <text start="1714.69" dur="5.07">trouble that&amp;#39;s coming out of the</text>
  <text start="1716.82" dur="6.69">internet and this is basically what</text>
  <text start="1719.76" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re going on to say now staying with</text>

  <text start="1781.77" dur="6.6">of false flag with this many people in a</text>
  <text start="1785.49" dur="7.05">certain area especially on july 4th this</text>
  <text start="1788.37" dur="6.72">also can be considered a potential type</text>
  <text start="1792.54" dur="5.61">of false flag now today they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="1795.09" dur="5.43">the toy gun march that seemed like it</text>
