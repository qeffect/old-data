  <text start="88.869" dur="4.641">starting to see that things are starting</text>
  <text start="90.82" dur="5.94">to break down the people out in Greece</text>
  <text start="93.51" dur="5.109">basically had enough already and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.76" dur="4.83">seeing one of the first strikes and the</text>
  <text start="98.619" dur="6.241">protests occurring after the deal was</text>
  <text start="101.59" dur="6.3">made to bail out Greece and this bailout</text>
  <text start="104.86" dur="6">is really no bailout basically it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="107.89" dur="5.909">plan to put the country further into</text>
  <text start="110.86" dur="4.619">debt and as time goes on things are just</text>
  <text start="113.799" dur="3.421">going to get worse and worse and right</text>
  <text start="115.479" dur="4.851">now the people are out and they were</text>
  <text start="117.22" dur="6.39">chanting in rallies held in Athens and</text>
  <text start="120.33" dur="5.98">they are just fed up with what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="123.61" dur="5.73">on and they brought basically everything</text>
  <text start="126.31" dur="6.11">to a screeching halt for about 24 hours</text>
  <text start="129.34" dur="6.209">schools hospitals banks museums</text>
  <text start="132.42" dur="6.4">pharmacies public services basically</text>
  <text start="135.549" dur="5.371">they did a 24 hour workout and this is</text>
  <text start="138.82" dur="5.009">something that the bankers need to be</text>
  <text start="140.92" dur="9.09">aware of is that the power of the people</text>
  <text start="143.829" dur="9.451">is very strong we are a society made up</text>
  <text start="150.01" dur="8.43">of many many many individuals and when</text>
  <text start="153.28" dur="8.76">we join together our power is unlimited</text>
  <text start="158.44" dur="5.7">and this is what the government&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="5.07">central bank&amp;#39;s fear the</text>
  <text start="164.14" dur="6.12">most this is why they continually keep</text>
  <text start="167.11" dur="6.45">us divided and keep us arguing about</text>
  <text start="170.26" dur="6">fringe issues they don&amp;#39;t want us as a</text>
  <text start="173.56" dur="7.47">people coming together they can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="176.26" dur="7.199">it happen now out in Australia they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="181.03" dur="5.429">come out with their job numbers and they</text>
  <text start="183.459" dur="4.921">said listen we&amp;#39;ve added 58 thousand six</text>
  <text start="186.459" dur="6.091">hundred jobs in October this is the</text>
  <text start="188.38" dur="6.87">biggest monthly jump since 2012 and the</text>
  <text start="192.55" dur="5.07">vast majority were full-time jobs and it</text>
  <text start="195.25" dur="5.55">looks like everything is fine what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="6">very interesting about Australia it</text>
  <text start="200.8" dur="7.89">looks like the media the corporate media</text>
  <text start="203.62" dur="7.8">is questioning the numbers from the</text>
  <text start="208.69" dur="4.829">government basically the corporate media</text>
  <text start="211.42" dur="5.81">in Australia is saying they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="213.519" dur="6.321">believe the job figures for October</text>
  <text start="217.23" dur="8.2">they&amp;#39;re telling everyone to be skeptical</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="7.45">treat with extreme caution nearly 60,000</text>
  <text start="225.43" dur="4.95">jobs created in Australia last month a</text>
  <text start="227.29" dur="5.759">full and the jobless rate in Victoria of</text>
  <text start="230.38" dur="5.37">point seven percent points something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.049" dur="4.921">wrong here now this is what the</text>
  <text start="235.75" dur="3.48">corporate media was supposed to do they</text>
  <text start="237.97" dur="3.87">weren&amp;#39;t call the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.23" dur="5.039">supposed to be journalists investigative</text>
  <text start="241.84" dur="4.649">journalists to keep the government&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="244.269" dur="4.351">check but of course they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="246.489" dur="5.041">the job so then all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="248.62" dur="4.709">needed another type of news media to</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="3.12">call them out on different things and</text>
  <text start="253.329" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s how the alternative media was</text>
  <text start="254.65" dur="5.49">born but we see in Australia not saying</text>
  <text start="258.669" dur="3.451">in all portions of it they are</text>
  <text start="260.14" dur="6.27">definitely calling out the government</text>
  <text start="262.12" dur="7.44">saying that these numbers are fake and</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="6.33">they wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if next month</text>
  <text start="269.56" dur="4.89">of the revised lower and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="272.74" dur="4.02">wait and see how that goes now here in</text>
  <text start="274.45" dur="6.18">the States we are continually seeing</text>
  <text start="276.76" dur="5.969">this economy declining it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="280.63" dur="5.88">worse day by day I mean look at the</text>
  <text start="282.729" dur="6.421">stock market today down 250 plus points</text>
  <text start="286.51" dur="5.31">we have been seeing a fluctuation in the</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="5.4">market since August now we know we they</text>
  <text start="291.82" dur="5.07">have the high-frequency traders the</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="3.45">plunge protection team they do whatever</text>
  <text start="296.89" dur="3.84">they possibly can the key</text>
  <text start="298" dur="5.55">the market up sometimes it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="300.73" dur="5.31">that well and this is how you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.55" dur="4.71">not a free market this is how you know</text>
  <text start="306.04" dur="7.56">it&amp;#39;s a controlled market today the</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="7.11">market fell and it&amp;#39;s basically tumbling</text>
  <text start="313.6" dur="3.27">now of course they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="315.37" dur="3.51">boost this up for Friday because they</text>
  <text start="316.87" dur="3.57">love happy endings on Friday but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="3.12">have to wait to see but when we look at</text>
  <text start="320.44" dur="5.52">the other economic indicators what do we</text>
  <text start="322" dur="12.27">see I mean we are seeing us a u.s.</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="12.03">freight and rail deliveries continually</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="6.03">declining transportation is a gaygent</text>
  <text start="337.99" dur="7.53">into how well the real economy is doing</text>
  <text start="340.3" dur="8.31">and it&amp;#39;s just continually getting worse</text>
  <text start="345.52" dur="4.71">in October the number of freight</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="4.38">shipments in North America fell from</text>
  <text start="350.23" dur="5.61">September so basically we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="352.99" dur="6.39">constant decline of freight deliveries</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="6.75">we&amp;#39;re seeing a 5.3 percent decrease and</text>
  <text start="359.38" dur="6.15">this is the worst since october of 2011</text>
  <text start="362.59" dur="8.01">and this is coming from the cast freight</text>
  <text start="365.53" dur="7.23">index we are seeing that the railroads</text>
  <text start="370.6" dur="5.42">they&amp;#39;re reporting October traffic was</text>
  <text start="372.76" dur="6.45">down four point three percent from 2014</text>
  <text start="376.02" dur="6.34">their car loads dropped twenty point</text>
  <text start="379.21" dur="4.89">seven percent and intermodal fell 20</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="7.2">point three percent from the previous</text>
  <text start="384.1" dur="6.99">month and we have to remember the goods</text>
  <text start="389.56" dur="4.05">that they&amp;#39;re shipping around the United</text>
  <text start="391.09" dur="4.98">States depends on what the people are</text>
  <text start="393.61" dur="6.63">doing what businesses are doing are they</text>
  <text start="396.07" dur="6.75">purchasing do they have jobs to make</text>
  <text start="400.24" dur="5.7">that extra money to go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="402.82" dur="6.24">and we&amp;#39;re not seeing it because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="6.84">seeing that stores their revenue is</text>
  <text start="409.06" dur="6.27">falling Macy&amp;#39;s banana republic and many</text>
  <text start="412.78" dur="5.639">other retail outlets are saying sales do</text>
  <text start="415.33" dur="4.77">not look good at this point of course</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="3.511">they&amp;#39;re blaming everything else except</text>
  <text start="420.1" dur="5.64">for the economy except for those people</text>
  <text start="421.93" dur="6.06">that don&amp;#39;t have jobs and if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="425.74" dur="4.77">purchasing then the freight and the</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="3.93">railroad do not have to deliver if they</text>
  <text start="430.51" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t have to deliver the</text>
  <text start="431.92" dur="4.89">factories don&amp;#39;t have to produce this is</text>
  <text start="434.62" dur="5.87">why we see a decline in freight and</text>
  <text start="436.81" dur="6.51">railroad and in manufacturing and if</text>
  <text start="440.49" dur="5.02">manufacturing is not producing guess</text>
  <text start="443.32" dur="4.58">what they don&amp;#39;t need the raw material</text>
  <text start="445.51" dur="5.72">this is why we see the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="447.9" dur="8.59">dropping once again another 20 points 2</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="9.34">579 at this point of the year we are</text>
  <text start="456.49" dur="6.45">going into the holiday seasons this is</text>
  <text start="460.57" dur="5.22">when people go out and purchase items</text>
  <text start="462.94" dur="5.55">this is when stores stock up this is</text>
  <text start="465.79" dur="7.02">when manufacturers go overboard to</text>
  <text start="468.49" dur="6.06">create we&amp;#39;re not seeing it we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="472.81" dur="3.66">the opposite it happened where this</text>
  <text start="474.55" dur="7.85">number right now should be close to</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="7.98">1,500 it&amp;#39;s completely more than half</text>
  <text start="482.4" dur="5.32">away from where it&amp;#39;s supposed to be at</text>
  <text start="484.45" dur="7.92">this point and we are starting to see</text>
  <text start="487.72" dur="7.02">the same exact patterns that we saw back</text>
  <text start="492.37" dur="8.43">in two thousand eight they haven&amp;#39;t gone</text>
  <text start="494.74" dur="8.97">away I mean most of the time a stark a</text>
  <text start="500.8" dur="5.01">stock market crash doesn&amp;#39;t just come out</text>
  <text start="503.71" dur="5.22">of nowhere normally there are very</text>
  <text start="505.81" dur="6.18">specific leading indicators that we look</text>
  <text start="508.93" dur="6.18">for that will tell us that a major</text>
  <text start="511.99" dur="5.91">trouble is on the horizon one of the</text>
  <text start="515.11" dur="6.24">leading indicators is like junk bond</text>
  <text start="517.9" dur="5.88">market right now closely watched a high</text>
  <text start="521.35" dur="6.77">yield bond ETF known as J and K is</text>
  <text start="523.78" dur="7.83">sitting at 35.7 7 if it falls below 35</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="6.51">we have a red flag and it&amp;#39;ll be the</text>
  <text start="531.61" dur="6.72">first time this has done so since 2009</text>
  <text start="534.63" dur="6.3">so far this year nearly 300 US</text>
  <text start="538.33" dur="5.67">corporations have seen their bonds</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="4.93">downgraded that&amp;#39;s the most downgrades</text>
  <text start="544" dur="6.6">per year since the financial crisis of</text>
  <text start="545.86" dur="8.55">08 and 09 because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="550.6" dur="6.81">right now is something that looks very</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="5.58">very close to two thousand eight now of</text>
  <text start="557.41" dur="5.25">course as we know the Fed they have the</text>
  <text start="559.99" dur="5.37">ability to continually pump the market</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="6.47">up they are the masters of this</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="7.95">and we know they want a controlled crash</text>
  <text start="569.13" dur="7.209">we see the Fed is out there fed st.</text>
  <text start="573.31" dur="6.57">Louis feds Bullard and he came up with</text>
  <text start="576.339" dur="6.711">the idea that the economy now is very</text>
  <text start="579.88" dur="5.91">close to being normal except for zerp</text>
  <text start="583.05" dur="5.05">except for the four trillion dollars on</text>
  <text start="585.79" dur="4.44">the balance sheet of the Fed except for</text>
  <text start="588.1" dur="3.84">retail contracting except for house</text>

  <text start="614.5" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re continually throwing people out</text>
  <text start="615.91" dur="5.01">of the unemployment arena and not</text>

  <text start="627.459" dur="5.911">central bankers say it is always the</text>
  <text start="630.279" dur="6.511">opposite now something strange is</text>
  <text start="633.37" dur="11.04">happening on the coast of Texas we are</text>
  <text start="636.79" dur="12.239">seeing a gargantuan oil um traffic jam</text>
  <text start="644.41" dur="8.7">of tankers I mean they are backlogged in</text>
  <text start="649.029" dur="6.861">Houston and there&amp;#39;s a backlog about</text>

  <text start="663.43" dur="7.08">and more oil there is no demand for this</text>
  <text start="667.3" dur="5.279">prices are falling of course we know the</text>
  <text start="670.51" dur="4.68">United States is behind this to put</text>
  <text start="672.579" dur="5.521">pressure on Russia to destroy their oil</text>
  <text start="675.19" dur="5.759">industry to put pressure on China and</text>
  <text start="678.1" dur="5.58">you keep the economy here in the United</text>
  <text start="680.949" dur="7.08">States alive which keeping these oil</text>
  <text start="683.68" dur="6.89">prices down allows businesses to be more</text>
  <text start="688.029" dur="5.521">profitable because as oil prices</text>
  <text start="690.57" dur="4.9">continually come down this is a savings</text>
  <text start="693.55" dur="5.67">because as we know these companies</text>
  <text start="695.47" dur="5.849">they&amp;#39;re manufacturing they&amp;#39;re delivering</text>
  <text start="699.22" dur="6.45">and this saves them billions and</text>
  <text start="701.319" dur="7.5">billions of dollars Russia right now is</text>
  <text start="705.67" dur="5.64">taking the next step they are launching</text>
  <text start="708.819" dur="5.341">a crude benchmark to end the dependence</text>
  <text start="711.31" dur="4.8">on the dollar now we&amp;#39;ve seen them come</text>
  <text start="714.16" dur="4.77">up with their own payment system we&amp;#39;ve</text>
