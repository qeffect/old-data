  <text start="41.03" dur="4.73">is US government making preparations to</text>
  <text start="43.79" dur="5.03">protect itself when the people revolt</text>
  <text start="45.76" dur="6.16">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="48.82" dur="5.23">political and geopolitical news now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="51.92" dur="4.59">starting to look like a lot more people</text>
  <text start="54.05" dur="3.719">are catching on to Obamacare where</text>
  <text start="56.51" dur="3.569">they&amp;#39;re looking at it and saying you</text>
  <text start="57.769" dur="5.161">know something this is not for the</text>
  <text start="60.079" dur="6.72">people because Pew Research did a survey</text>
  <text start="62.93" dur="6.479">and it was released on Wednesday saying</text>
  <text start="66.799" dur="5.101">that 54% of Americans they completely</text>
  <text start="69.409" dur="4.201">disapprove of the Affordable Care Act</text>
  <text start="71.9" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s not affordable it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="73.61" dur="4.259">not a benefit to me the duck need</text>
  <text start="75.65" dur="5.19">deductibles are too high and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="77.869" dur="4.351">seeing this number increase and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="80.84" dur="2.88">going to continually increase because</text>
  <text start="82.22" dur="4.829">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="83.72" dur="6.24">calling for higher premiums once again</text>
  <text start="87.049" dur="4.14">and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="89.96" dur="3.54">the people are going to say enough is</text>
  <text start="91.189" dur="3.931">enough we can&amp;#39;t have this this is not</text>
  <text start="93.5" dur="5.33">affordable this is not good for the</text>
  <text start="95.12" dur="6.69">people and guess what it really isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="98.83" dur="7.12">now the House of Representatives they</text>
  <text start="101.81" dur="8.16">approved a bill and this bill which is</text>
  <text start="105.95" dur="6.84">the email Privacy Act HB 699 it closes a</text>
  <text start="109.97" dur="4.14">loophole in the 1986 electronic</text>
  <text start="112.79" dur="4.29">communication Privacy Act that allows</text>
  <text start="114.11" dur="5.1">emails to be accessed by law enforcement</text>
  <text start="117.08" dur="4.95">with only a subpoena to the company</text>
  <text start="119.21" dur="5.37">storing them not a warrant so they had</text>
  <text start="122.03" dur="5.37">to come up with a new bill which the</text>
  <text start="124.58" dur="8.82">House of Representatives voted on and it</text>
  <text start="127.4" dur="10.07">passed but the question I have this</text>
  <text start="133.4" dur="7.32">information no matter where it is if</text>
  <text start="137.47" dur="8.189">it&amp;#39;s kept with a company if it&amp;#39;s kept in</text>
  <text start="140.72" dur="4.939">your home is your private information</text>
  <text start="145.689" dur="9.071">why do we need more laws don&amp;#39;t we have</text>
  <text start="152.18" dur="7.08">one already it&amp;#39;s called the Fourth</text>
  <text start="154.76" dur="6.42">Amendment the Fourth Amendment says they</text>
  <text start="159.26" dur="4.92">need a warrant to look and search</text>
  <text start="161.18" dur="5.46">through your private information</text>
  <text start="164.18" dur="6.139">plain and simple I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="166.64" dur="6.42">if you had a piece of paper in a lockbox</text>
  <text start="170.319" dur="6.821">or you had a flash drive in a lock</text>
  <text start="173.06" dur="6.87">blocks can they just get a subpoena and</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="3.87">look at it no they need a warrant if it</text>
  <text start="179.93" dur="4.01">is in a bank</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="7.289">in a vault in your safety deposit box</text>
  <text start="183.94" dur="6.43">what do they need that&amp;#39;s right a warrant</text>
  <text start="188.299" dur="4.53">so why is this any different it</text>
  <text start="190.37" dur="7.02">shouldn&amp;#39;t be but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="192.829" dur="8.041">that our congresspeople the government</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="5.819">employees there they&amp;#39;re just no no one</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="5.16">is referring back to the rights of the</text>
  <text start="203.209" dur="5.31">people now we all have to protect</text>
  <text start="206.03" dur="4.019">ourselves we can&amp;#39;t depend on all these</text>
  <text start="208.519" dur="4.05">ridiculous laws because if they need</text>
  <text start="210.049" dur="4.171">another law on top of another law on top</text>
  <text start="212.569" dur="3.151">of another law when we already have a</text>
  <text start="214.22" dur="4.98">law and they&amp;#39;re not even following that</text>
  <text start="215.72" dur="5.909">law what&amp;#39;s the use so each and every one</text>
  <text start="219.2" dur="5.58">needs to protect their information now</text>
  <text start="221.629" dur="6.631">if you were writing personal information</text>
  <text start="224.78" dur="6.269">on a piece of paper or you had personal</text>
  <text start="228.26" dur="5.19">documentation what would you do with it</text>
  <text start="231.049" dur="4.231">you would lock it up in some type of</text>
  <text start="233.45" dur="2.399">safe in some type of box you would have</text>
  <text start="235.28" dur="3.63">a key</text>
  <text start="235.849" dur="5.461">because it&amp;#39;s your personal information</text>
  <text start="238.91" dur="4.829">it&amp;#39;s valuable if you have personal</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="5.16">information in email or in electronic</text>
  <text start="243.739" dur="4.231">form what do you do well if you have a</text>
  <text start="246.47" dur="4.949">flash drive you can lock it up in the</text>
  <text start="247.97" dur="7.29">safe or in a box with a key or if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.419" dur="7.29">email you need to use encryption if you</text>
  <text start="255.26" dur="5.189">don&amp;#39;t want people spying on you shield</text>
  <text start="258.709" dur="4.411">your phone you can use a product like</text>
  <text start="260.449" dur="4.801">block it pocket comm they have these</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="4.62">little sleeves you can slide your phone</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="3.419">into it you can slide your credit cards</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="2.52">in it that you know the ones that have</text>
  <text start="268.669" dur="4.201">the little chips and nobody can scan you</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="7.5">as you walk by you can do all of these</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="7.41">things to protect yourself I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="277.76" dur="6.45">why we need more and more laws it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="6.66">getting out of hand we should refer to</text>
  <text start="284.21" dur="5.239">what the Founding Fathers did they did</text>
  <text start="286.94" dur="4.44">it on purpose because they knew</text>
  <text start="289.449" dur="4.111">governments become tyrannical</text>
  <text start="291.38" dur="5.13">governments become out of control</text>
  <text start="293.56" dur="4.66">governments like to spy on people they</text>
  <text start="296.51" dur="4.17">knew this</text>
  <text start="298.22" dur="5.25">now yeah was it yesterday of the day</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="6.38">before we mentioned the NDAA and we</text>
  <text start="303.47" dur="8.67">mentioned one of the amendments was to</text>
  <text start="307.06" dur="10.3">include women in the draft and it looks</text>
  <text start="312.14" dur="8.67">like Congress now voted that yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="6.3">going to add this where every woman will</text>
  <text start="320.81" dur="7.14">need to register with the Selective</text>
  <text start="323.66" dur="8.37">Service to be drafted at a later time</text>
  <text start="327.95" dur="8.64">and they&amp;#39;re opening up the Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="332.03" dur="7.56">to women in combat roles and we see</text>
  <text start="336.59" dur="6.66">right now that they&amp;#39;re not doing this</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="6.18">because oh it&amp;#39;s equal rights for men and</text>
  <text start="343.25" dur="4.53">women I have no problem with equal</text>
  <text start="345.77" dur="4.77">rights for men and women I have</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="4.2">daughters I believe they&amp;#39;re equal to</text>
  <text start="350.54" dur="5.94">every single man they can do everything</text>
  <text start="351.98" dur="7.86">that a man can do and what I see</text>
  <text start="356.48" dur="11.33">happening is is that when we get into</text>
  <text start="359.84" dur="12.72">war I believe they want all Americans</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="6.7">ready to go for the draft because we</text>
  <text start="372.56" dur="7.76">have to remember something very</text>
  <text start="374.51" dur="10.56">important this war will be fought on</text>
  <text start="380.32" dur="5.91">American soil people say well how how</text>
  <text start="385.07" dur="4.65">can that be</text>
  <text start="386.23" dur="5.65">remember today the weaponry very very</text>
  <text start="389.72" dur="5.78">different than the weaponry of World War</text>
  <text start="391.88" dur="7.14">two World War one today there are</text>
  <text start="395.5" dur="7.6">missile systems hypersonic missile</text>
  <text start="399.02" dur="8.91">systems ballistic missile systems that</text>
  <text start="403.1" dur="8.7">can reach the US countries do have the</text>
  <text start="407.93" dur="9.48">ability to fly planes without being</text>
  <text start="411.8" dur="8.61">detected and drop armed forces onto US</text>
  <text start="417.41" dur="6.95">soil they have the ability to sneak up</text>
  <text start="420.41" dur="7.59">under the water without being detected</text>
  <text start="424.36" dur="5.14">so when people say oh you know this</text>
  <text start="428" dur="3.99">world war is going to be fought in</text>
  <text start="429.5" dur="6.09">Europe it&amp;#39;s going to be fought every</text>
  <text start="431.99" dur="6.93">we&amp;#39;re and they realize this and they</text>
  <text start="435.59" dur="5.64">need every single American involved in</text>
  <text start="438.92" dur="5.58">this just like in Europe when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="441.23" dur="5.52">fought on their land it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="444.5" dur="5.43">disaster but the central bankers don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="5.82">care this is a risk they&amp;#39;re willing to</text>
  <text start="449.93" dur="4.95">take the risk of the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.57" dur="5.88">willing to take they&amp;#39;ll go hide in their</text>
  <text start="454.88" dur="8.79">bunkers until it&amp;#39;s all over now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="458.45" dur="9.51">is suspecting that North Korea fired</text>
  <text start="463.67" dur="6.09">another mid-range missile now there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="467.96" dur="3.96">clear evidence that they actually did</text>
  <text start="469.76" dur="5.43">this we&amp;#39;re getting this information out</text>
  <text start="471.92" dur="5.94">of South Korea once again we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="475.19" dur="4.2">information from the US but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="5.07">real confirmation they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="479.39" dur="5.67">was a second attempt and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="482.93" dur="3.87">doing is they&amp;#39;re building up the idea</text>
  <text start="485.06" dur="4.65">that North Korea will have the ability</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="5.19">to reach the United States that they are</text>
  <text start="489.71" dur="3.78">a major major threat now remember the</text>
  <text start="491.99" dur="3.66">North North Korea wanted to sit down</text>
  <text start="493.49" dur="5.57">with the u.s. and talk about what is</text>
  <text start="495.65" dur="6.69">going on here because they realize that</text>
  <text start="499.06" dur="6.88">they will not survive this it will be a</text>
  <text start="502.34" dur="5.4">complete disaster for them not for China</text>
  <text start="505.94" dur="5.49">not for Russia but yes for North Korea</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="5.67">and all the sanctions the u.s. placed on</text>
  <text start="511.43" dur="4.89">North Korea but guess what</text>
  <text start="513.41" dur="4.8">it doesn&amp;#39;t work even Obama said</text>
  <text start="516.32" dur="3.36">sanctions don&amp;#39;t work when they remove</text>
  <text start="518.21" dur="3.51">the sanctions on Cuba but they keep</text>
  <text start="519.68" dur="4.68">placing sanctions on different countries</text>
  <text start="521.72" dur="5.81">think about it North Korea has been</text>
  <text start="524.36" dur="8.09">sanctioned five times by the UN</text>
  <text start="527.53" dur="11.88">resolution 1718 2006 resolution 1874</text>
  <text start="532.45" dur="10.83">2009 resolution 2020 87 in the year 2013</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="8.55">resolution 2094 in the year 2013</text>
  <text start="543.28" dur="8.4">resolution 2270 in the year 2016 and</text>
  <text start="547.96" dur="7.69">resolution 2270 is the strongest one yet</text>
  <text start="551.68" dur="6.34">spelling out in great detail how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.65" dur="4.92">going to sanction the shipment of</text>
  <text start="558.02" dur="5.81">products and everything else with North</text>
  <text start="560.57" dur="5.32">Korea but North Korea and every country</text>
  <text start="563.83" dur="5.39">they always get</text>
  <text start="565.89" dur="8.069">sanctions and one of the common tactics</text>
  <text start="569.22" dur="6.9">is to change the ship&amp;#39;s Rhee flag it</text>
  <text start="573.959" dur="5.25">under a different name change the</text>
  <text start="576.12" dur="4.38">destination and the ports trade without</text>
  <text start="579.209" dur="4.861">using the dollar</text>
  <text start="580.5" dur="6.779">we saw Cuba was doing it Iran was doing</text>
  <text start="584.07" dur="8.31">it Syria is doing it Russia is doing it</text>
  <text start="587.279" dur="7.171">so sanctions don&amp;#39;t work now out in</text>
  <text start="592.38" dur="4.74">Ukraine it looks like the US Department</text>
  <text start="594.45" dur="4.35">state deputy spokesperson Mark Toner is</text>
  <text start="597.12" dur="5.88">trying to convince the world that</text>
  <text start="598.8" dur="6.18">Ukraine implemented most of the Minsk</text>
  <text start="603" dur="3.99">agreement terms and Russia and the</text>
  <text start="604.98" dur="4.859">southeastern people they failed to take</text>
  <text start="606.99" dur="4.77">the same steps and when you really look</text>
  <text start="609.839" dur="6.411">at this actually the opposite has</text>
  <text start="611.76" dur="7.139">happened what he forgot to say was that</text>
  <text start="616.25" dur="5.44">Kiev was supposed to change their</text>
  <text start="618.899" dur="5.341">constitution and allow the southeastern</text>
  <text start="621.69" dur="3.99">people to hold elections and this was</text>
  <text start="624.24" dur="5.539">supposed to be done by the end of</text>
  <text start="625.68" dur="7.409">December of 2015 which it was never done</text>
  <text start="629.779" dur="5.351">so this is the sticking point that</text>
  <text start="633.089" dur="4.74">Russia the southeastern people have been</text>
  <text start="635.13" dur="6.63">saying Kiev is not doing plus they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="637.829" dur="6.811">been moving heavy military equipment up</text>
  <text start="641.76" dur="4.41">to the contact line and we can see that</text>
  <text start="644.64" dur="3.389">a lot of this propaganda that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="646.17" dur="3.659">out right now is to convince the world</text>
  <text start="648.029" dur="4.291">that Kiev is abiding by the mins to</text>
  <text start="649.829" dur="5.581">ceasefire agreement and the southeastern</text>
  <text start="652.32" dur="4.379">people are not now the question is why</text>
  <text start="655.41" dur="3.21">are they building this up once again</text>
  <text start="656.699" dur="5.781">well they want the entire country but</text>
  <text start="658.62" dur="7.01">why because recently they discovered a</text>
  <text start="662.48" dur="7.87">huge amount of oil and gas in the</text>
  <text start="665.63" dur="7.84">Kharkov region and we know that dunams</text>
  <text start="670.35" dur="5.929">and Lugansk in those regions they have a</text>
  <text start="673.47" dur="7.53">lot of oil and gas in those regions and</text>
  <text start="676.279" dur="7.961">they want these areas back they want the</text>
  <text start="681" dur="5.459">entire area and it looks like at this</text>
  <text start="684.24" dur="3.99">point things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="686.459" dur="3.87">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re pushing for a</text>
  <text start="688.23" dur="6.859">major offensive now in the South China</text>
  <text start="690.329" dur="8.041">Sea China is out there saying listen we</text>
  <text start="695.089" dur="4.721">see what the US is doing here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="698.37" dur="2.82">trying to provoke us</text>
  <text start="699.81" dur="4.38">and you know what we&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="701.19" dur="6.18">since the US doesn&amp;#39;t even belong in this</text>
  <text start="704.19" dur="6.48">area it&amp;#39;s none of none of these</text>
  <text start="707.37" dur="6.72">countries are part of the US we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="710.67" dur="7.02">do the following we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="714.09" dur="5.85">talks with all the countries that have a</text>
  <text start="717.69" dur="6.03">problem with us in the South China Sea</text>
  <text start="719.94" dur="6.66">China will work with South East and Asia</text>
  <text start="723.72" dur="4.95">nations to make the South China Sea a</text>
  <text start="726.6" dur="4.8">region of peace and friendship and</text>
  <text start="728.67" dur="4.44">cooperation and we do not want the</text>
  <text start="731.4" dur="3.629">United States involved in this because</text>
  <text start="733.11" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s no reason for them to even be</text>

  <text start="751.32" dur="4.11">would be those countries that you talk</text>
  <text start="753.27" dur="5.94">to China so China at this point is</text>
  <text start="755.43" dur="7.38">trying to tamp this down by excluding</text>
  <text start="759.21" dur="5.25">the US and talking to the other nations</text>

  <text start="767.61" dur="3.36">they want to continually push and push</text>
  <text start="769.5" dur="4.5">and push until they get something</text>
  <text start="770.97" dur="5.55">started there now France and a lot of</text>
  <text start="774" dur="6.3">European countries are saying you know</text>

  <text start="1020.85" dur="5.37">disinformation practiced by some parties</text>
  <text start="1022.829" dur="5.671">at the US administration so we do have a</text>

  <text start="1028.5" dur="7.439">word out that yes we have been</text>
  <text start="1031.61" dur="6.87">misinformed about this and most likely</text>
  <text start="1035.939" dur="5.971">as we were reporting everything else</text>
  <text start="1038.48" dur="6.189">because the government doesn&amp;#39;t tell the</text>

  <text start="1053.4" dur="9.5">truth and now we have a hospital that</text>
  <text start="1057.809" dur="7.531">was hit in Syria now the militants</text>
  <text start="1062.9" dur="4.36">they&amp;#39;ve broken the ceasefire and it</text>
  <text start="1065.34" dur="4.74">looks like the UN Syria envoy is saying</text>
  <text start="1067.26" dur="5.51">that ceasefire is barely alive</text>
  <text start="1070.08" dur="5.7">and it looks like the u.s. is trying to</text>
  <text start="1072.77" dur="5.289">use whatever they possibly can to cancel</text>
  <text start="1075.78" dur="4.83">the ceasefire peace Dale and blame it on</text>
  <text start="1078.059" dur="5.641">Assad and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="1080.61" dur="5.49">that the Syrian forces the Russian</text>
  <text start="1083.7" dur="4.8">forces they&amp;#39;re getting ready for a major</text>

  <text start="1089.76" dur="5.01">building up their forces and we see the</text>
  <text start="1091.89" dur="3.81">Islamic state the new sewer front the</text>
  <text start="1094.77" dur="3.51">Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="1095.7" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;ve been shelling and firing</text>
  <text start="1098.28" dur="5.63">missiles at civilians in Aleppo</text>
  <text start="1101.43" dur="6.72">in Aleppo about 40 people were killed</text>
  <text start="1103.91" dur="7.75">140 were injured and it seems like a</text>
  <text start="1108.15" dur="7.25">hospital was hit right now Doctors</text>
  <text start="1111.66" dur="7.77">Without Borders Hospital it was hit and</text>
  <text start="1115.4" dur="6.04">we realize that the Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="1119.43" dur="4.65">they broke the ceasefire they are firing</text>
  <text start="1121.44" dur="4.26">on Aleppo because they understand that</text>
  <text start="1124.08" dur="4.14">Russia and Syria they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="1125.7" dur="5.1">to mount this major major offensive the</text>
  <text start="1128.22" dur="6.42">u.s. knows this and they need to get out</text>
  <text start="1130.8" dur="5.87">of this the whole entire ceasefire peace</text>
  <text start="1134.64" dur="5.25">talk agenda</text>
  <text start="1136.67" dur="6.04">so the Doctors Without Borders they</text>
  <text start="1139.89" dur="5.46">condemned the strikes on the hospital</text>
  <text start="1142.71" dur="4.62">now they didn&amp;#39;t name who did it they</text>
  <text start="1145.35" dur="4.74">didn&amp;#39;t say oh it was definitely Assad</text>
  <text start="1147.33" dur="5.67">it was definitely Russia they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1150.09" dur="5.37">really say that they just condemned what</text>
  <text start="1153" dur="4.26">happened there but of course the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1155.46" dur="3.42">came out with the propaganda and said it</text>
  <text start="1157.26" dur="5.28">was decided was decided was Assad to</text>
  <text start="1158.88" dur="6.33">cease fire talks are off but when you</text>
  <text start="1162.54" dur="6.45">look you see that the Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="1165.21" dur="8.13">the terrorists they were firing on the</text>
  <text start="1168.99" dur="5.88">civilians in that area and of course the</text>
  <text start="1173.34" dur="2.73">United States is out there saying this</text>
  <text start="1174.87" dur="4.83">is horrific</text>
  <text start="1176.07" dur="6.21">this is unbelievable well didn&amp;#39;t the US</text>
  <text start="1179.7" dur="5.79">just do this in Yemen with Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="1182.28" dur="6.21">didn&amp;#39;t they just do it with in</text>
  <text start="1185.49" dur="5.31">Afghanistan first they tried to deny it</text>
  <text start="1188.49" dur="7.56">then there was proof and they had to</text>
  <text start="1190.8" dur="7.53">admit to it and most likely it was the</text>
  <text start="1196.05" dur="5.67">Free Syrian Army and the terrorists once</text>
  <text start="1198.33" dur="7.62">again and they&amp;#39;re using this to get out</text>
  <text start="1201.72" dur="6.99">of the ceasefire and peace talks now we</text>
  <text start="1205.95" dur="5.52">see that the base the military base in</text>
  <text start="1208.71" dur="3.15">Qatar that Turkey is building well guess</text>
  <text start="1211.47" dur="3.54">what</text>
  <text start="1211.86" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s a multi-purpose military base for</text>
  <text start="1215.01" dur="6.3">its Air Force and it will house about</text>
  <text start="1217.53" dur="8.34">3,000 soldiers and it is now operational</text>
  <text start="1221.31" dur="8.4">and we can see right now that they have</text>
  <text start="1225.87" dur="7.32">a base there they have a base in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="1229.71" dur="5.7">and we can see at this point all of this</text>
  <text start="1233.19" dur="7.11">is being readied</text>
  <text start="1235.41" dur="9.66">for this upcoming war now Germany very</text>
  <text start="1240.3" dur="10.62">interestingly is spending about 65</text>
  <text start="1245.07" dur="8.94">million to upgrade a new military base</text>
  <text start="1250.92" dur="5.61">air base at Turkey&amp;#39;s Incirlik Air Base</text>
  <text start="1254.01" dur="6.99">and it should be finished by the summer</text>
  <text start="1256.53" dur="8.04">of 2017 it will house about 400 German</text>
  <text start="1261" dur="5.7">soldiers a fully equipped command and</text>
  <text start="1264.57" dur="5.64">control post and facilities for a full</text>
  <text start="1266.7" dur="10.43">wing of Tornado fighters and Airbus</text>
  <text start="1270.21" dur="11.63">tankers so we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="1277.13" dur="7.66">military assets the building of bases</text>
  <text start="1281.84" dur="7.44">troops being moved into different</text>
  <text start="1284.79" dur="9.87">locations all of this is being done for</text>
  <text start="1289.28" dur="9.64">what is coming and that is war and we</text>
  <text start="1294.66" dur="7.71">see that the u.s. is looking at placing</text>
  <text start="1298.92" dur="6.93">intermediate range missiles because back</text>
  <text start="1302.37" dur="6.45">in 2014 back in 2015 they were saying</text>
  <text start="1305.85" dur="5.94">that Russia violated violated the INF</text>
  <text start="1308.82" dur="4.56">treaty Russia rejected this but the US</text>
  <text start="1311.79" dur="4.74">Department is using this saying well</text>
  <text start="1313.38" dur="6.54">since they violated it guess what we can</text>
  <text start="1316.53" dur="8.25">now put in intermediate range missiles</text>
  <text start="1319.92" dur="6.27">and Russia hat can&amp;#39;t say anything about</text>
  <text start="1324.78" dur="5.61">it because they violated the INF</text>
  <text start="1326.19" dur="7.11">agreement now they use this so they have</text>
  <text start="1330.39" dur="5.97">the ability to do this and we see right</text>
  <text start="1333.3" dur="6.81">now all of this is building up at this</text>
  <text start="1336.36" dur="6.21">point now Ashton Carter Obama they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1340.11" dur="5.52">trying to explain away why the 250 US</text>
  <text start="1342.57" dur="4.76">soldiers are in northern Syria without</text>
