  <text start="107.909" dur="4.92">get any everything under control and</text>
  <text start="110.34" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re seeing that SP and rating agencies</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="3.96">are going and downgrading many of the</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="2.879">countries I believe they should be</text>
  <text start="116.789" dur="4.911">downgraded even further because most of</text>
  <text start="118.439" dur="7.051">the countries have a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="121.7" dur="6.729">very high unemployment and they do not</text>
  <text start="125.49" dur="5.579">have the revenue coming in to sustain</text>
  <text start="128.429" dur="4.981">the payments on the debt so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="131.069" dur="4.711">understand how these rating agencies can</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="4.32">sit there with the ratings they have</text>
  <text start="135.78" dur="4.019">with these countries but then again we</text>

  <text start="496.83" dur="4.86">happening at this time and right now of</text>
  <text start="499.86" dur="4.32">course the United States sees this and</text>
  <text start="501.69" dur="4.14">says ho ho wait a minute the United</text>
  <text start="504.18" dur="4.5">States has warned North Korea against</text>

  <text start="526.23" dur="5.37">not in the interest of the regional</text>
  <text start="527.82" dur="5.97">stability and of course they do not want</text>

  <text start="702.53" dur="6.95">and to provide Ukraine of it sovereignty</text>
  <text start="705.38" dur="7.38">and this is what Russia has said now</text>
  <text start="709.48" dur="5.26">Russia is very concerned of the missile</text>
  <text start="712.76" dur="4.35">shield ranging from Poland all the way</text>
  <text start="714.74" dur="4.83">down to Romania across Europe and of</text>
  <text start="717.11" dur="5.25">course this was set up to protect the</text>
  <text start="719.57" dur="4.68">European area from Iran because of their</text>
  <text start="722.36" dur="4.08">nuclear weapons and there&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="724.25" dur="3.69">there they could strike any second and a</text>
  <text start="726.44" dur="4.28">lot of the missiles are pointed to</text>
  <text start="727.94" dur="5.97">Russia and to Iran and to China and</text>
  <text start="730.72" dur="6.91">right now Russia is going to deploy a</text>
  <text start="733.91" dur="7.26">missile system in the call&amp;#39;n grad to</text>
  <text start="737.63" dur="5.01">neutralize the missile shield in Europe</text>
  <text start="741.17" dur="4.41">ranging from Poland all the way down to</text>
  <text start="742.64" dur="4.74">Romania and Russia has stationed</text>
  <text start="745.58" dur="5.67">missiles with a range of about 500</text>

  <text start="755.89" dur="8.4">and we can see what&amp;#39;s going on here they</text>
  <text start="760.34" dur="8.61">are preparing because again the US was</text>
  <text start="764.29" dur="8.02">in peace talks with Iran and they had</text>
  <text start="768.95" dur="8.01">this six-month interim of relieving</text>
  <text start="772.31" dur="6.51">sanctions and letting and talking to</text>
  <text start="776.96" dur="3.96">Iran and Russia was out there since</text>
  <text start="778.82" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;re doing this piece why do you need</text>
  <text start="780.92" dur="4.62">this missile shield anymore you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="782.66" dur="4.62">really need it and Obama and his</text>
  <text start="785.54" dur="3.3">administration said no we are not going</text>
  <text start="787.28" dur="3.78">to dismantle it that stain where it is</text>
  <text start="788.84" dur="6.6">period that&amp;#39;s that and then all of a</text>
  <text start="791.06" dur="6.39">sudden we see the United States you know</text>
  <text start="795.44" dur="4.98">tighten the sanctions and not and not</text>
  <text start="797.45" dur="6.27">letting certain businesses and oil</text>
  <text start="800.42" dur="4.92">companies do business because again the</text>
  <text start="803.72" dur="3.12">central bankers do not have control of</text>
  <text start="805.34" dur="3.88">the central bank in Iran and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="806.84" dur="4.599">want Iran selling the natural</text>
  <text start="809.22" dur="4.739">is without using the US dollar as the</text>
  <text start="811.439" dur="5.371">reserve currency at this time so I ran</text>
  <text start="813.959" dur="5.43">back down and now of course the the</text>
  <text start="816.81" dur="4.8">corporate media is spinnin it that Iran</text>
  <text start="819.389" dur="4.2">has backed out of the nuclear deals</text>
  <text start="821.61" dur="5.01">which is the illusion part of the entire</text>
  <text start="823.589" dur="4.651">thing because again Iran was testing</text>
  <text start="826.62" dur="3.659">ballistic missiles in the u.s. didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="5.25">have a problem with that and that should</text>
  <text start="830.279" dur="5.971">have been you know a huge problem if</text>
  <text start="833.49" dur="4.26">this is nuclear talks and they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="836.25" dur="3.689">concerned about their nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="837.75" dur="5.16">but again they want them to do this</text>
  <text start="839.939" dur="5.4">because eventually this whole entire</text>
  <text start="842.91" dur="4.32">deal and this piece that they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="845.339" dur="4.591">about is going to completely fall apart</text>
  <text start="847.23" dur="5.099">because this is a Sharad and what they</text>
  <text start="849.93" dur="7.199">want to do is they want to build this up</text>
  <text start="852.329" dur="7.411">and have some type of event occur and</text>
  <text start="857.129" dur="7.5">blame it on Iran and this is where they</text>
  <text start="859.74" dur="7.32">are moving at this time now the</text>
  <text start="864.629" dur="4.531">Department of Energy was hit with a huge</text>

  <text start="894.75" dur="5.519">Department of Energy and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="897.449" dur="4.471">saying is that this hit was much larger</text>
  <text start="900.269" dur="3.18">than they said they just didn&amp;#39;t get a</text>
  <text start="901.92" dur="4.2">little bit of information they got a lot</text>

  <text start="914.79" dur="5.789">lot more information now the question I</text>
  <text start="918" dur="4.62">have this is Department of Energy they</text>
  <text start="920.579" dur="3.63">hadn&amp;#39;t attacked back in January which</text>
  <text start="922.62" dur="4.019">they blamed on China this one they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.209" dur="5.521">still investigating and they haven&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="926.639" dur="5.49">blame on this yet will this be used in</text>
  <text start="929.73" dur="4.709">the cyber attack that is coming very</text>
  <text start="932.129" dur="4.65">soon to the United States because they</text>
  <text start="934.439" dur="4.71">they need this event to take all eyes</text>
  <text start="936.779" dur="5.37">off of the collapse that is coming and</text>
  <text start="939.149" dur="3.781">we will have to see because now they</text>
  <text start="942.149" dur="3.471">have only in from</text>
  <text start="942.93" dur="5.849">nation they have access codes to certain</text>
  <text start="945.62" dur="5.65">systems and they don&amp;#39;t know the full</text>
  <text start="948.779" dur="5.521">extent of the damage they don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="951.27" dur="5.25">malware was placed into the system they</text>
  <text start="954.3" dur="4.5">are still inspecting it and they are</text>
  <text start="956.52" dur="6.06">looking into this right now now we</text>
  <text start="958.8" dur="6.99">understand that Syria that event with</text>
  <text start="962.58" dur="8.46">the chemical weapons was you know</text>
  <text start="965.79" dur="7.08">completely a complete setback for the</text>
  <text start="971.04" dur="2.85">central bankers in the US government</text>
  <text start="972.87" dur="4.19">because they really wanted to get the</text>
  <text start="973.89" dur="5.46">war started back in August and right now</text>
  <text start="977.06" dur="4.839">before this happened they send troops</text>
  <text start="979.35" dur="4.38">down to Jordan and they sent a lot of</text>
  <text start="981.899" dur="3.481">military acids and back then they said</text>
  <text start="983.73" dur="3.479">it was only for training that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="985.38" dur="3.72">were sending it there but we all knew</text>
  <text start="987.209" dur="3.511">that this was not for training because</text>
  <text start="989.1" dur="3.78">we understand there&amp;#39;s CENTCOM which is</text>
  <text start="990.72" dur="4.83">an underground base that holds officers</text>
  <text start="992.88" dur="5.399">and that was set up and it is protected</text>
  <text start="995.55" dur="6.06">from missile attacks that was going to</text>
  <text start="998.279" dur="6.18">be used for the command center while</text>
  <text start="1001.61" dur="5.22">they were striking Syria and these</text>
  <text start="1004.459" dur="4.771">troops and the military assets in Jordan</text>
  <text start="1006.83" dur="4.86">were going to be used for the strike</text>
  <text start="1009.23" dur="6.18">into Syria and right now the president</text>
  <text start="1011.69" dur="5.85">came out and said that the American</text>
  <text start="1015.41" dur="4.52">troops stationed in Jordan will remain</text>
  <text start="1017.54" dur="5.99">there until the security situation in</text>
  <text start="1019.93" dur="7.24">Syria improves now the question is how</text>
  <text start="1023.53" dur="6.399">is this a security situation in Syria</text>
  <text start="1027.17" dur="4.11">going to improve now the only reason</text>
  <text start="1029.929" dur="3.451">you&amp;#39;re there keeping them there is</text>
  <text start="1031.28" dur="5.01">because they are planning something and</text>
  <text start="1033.38" dur="5.189">eventually they will be going in to</text>
  <text start="1036.29" dur="4.169">remove Assad and the way they need to</text>
  <text start="1038.569" dur="5.101">get in there and the only way they can</text>
  <text start="1040.459" dur="5.161">get in there is to do some type of an</text>
  <text start="1043.67" dur="3.539">event and we know a certain couple</text>
  <text start="1045.62" dur="4.71">things that are happening right now we</text>
  <text start="1047.209" dur="6.061">understand UN is bringing up charges</text>
  <text start="1050.33" dur="4.5">against Assad for war crimes they did</text>
  <text start="1053.27" dur="3.42">this with Qaddafi and they brought the</text>
  <text start="1054.83" dur="4.2">NATO forces in and removed him and</text>
  <text start="1056.69" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re trying the same tactic that way</text>
  <text start="1059.03" dur="5.94">we understand that cNN has reported that</text>
  <text start="1061.61" dur="5.49">Assad has a hidden cache of chemical</text>
  <text start="1064.97" dur="4.44">weapons and right now chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1067.1" dur="4.26">or a border ship going out to sea to</text>
  <text start="1069.41" dur="3.66">dispose of them and who knows some of</text>
  <text start="1071.36" dur="3.99">those chemical weapons could make their</text>
  <text start="1073.07" dur="3.04">way back into the u.s. we also have the</text>

  <text start="1076.11" dur="6">of some type of radioactive material</text>
  <text start="1079.32" dur="4.71">stolen in mexico they found the people</text>

  <text start="1086.75" dur="5.559">missing radiation that they cannot find</text>
  <text start="1089.79" dur="6.65">at this time so they are definitely</text>
  <text start="1092.309" dur="8.821">planning something at this time now I</text>
  <text start="1096.44" dur="6.91">believe this Kansas terrorism plot is a</text>

  <text start="1142.95" dur="4.74">dianne feinstein mike rogers was saying</text>
