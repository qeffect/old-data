  <text start="142.69" dur="5.97">Florida was empty of course that wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="146.23" dur="4.86">true whatsoever they took the pictures</text>
  <text start="148.66" dur="3.96">before the people actually really got</text>
  <text start="151.09" dur="3.869">there or just a couple of people&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="152.62" dur="4.679">couple of people were there and they</text>
  <text start="154.959" dur="6.211">snapped pictures and they used that just</text>
  <text start="157.299" dur="6.151">like when he was being inaugurated they</text>
  <text start="161.17" dur="3.9">said that there was really nobody there</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="3.33">compared to Obama&amp;#39;s crowd and of course</text>
  <text start="165.07" dur="4.47">the pictures weren&amp;#39;t taken at the same</text>
  <text start="166.78" dur="3.59">exact time and of course they lied about</text>
  <text start="169.54" dur="3.72">that</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="5.709">CNN falsely edited a video to make it</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="4.77">appear Trump defiantly overfed fish</text>
  <text start="176.079" dur="4.831">during a visit with the Japanese Prime</text>
  <text start="178.03" dur="4.98">Minister now the Japanese Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="180.91" dur="4.139">actually led the way with the feeding</text>
  <text start="183.01" dur="4.17">and dump the whole thing in then Trump</text>
  <text start="185.049" dur="6.05">fouled but they left that little part</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="7.199">now CNN foster reported about Anthony</text>
  <text start="191.099" dur="5.53">scaramouche&amp;#39;s meeting with a Russian but</text>
  <text start="194.379" dur="4.59">retracted it due to a significant</text>
  <text start="196.629" dur="5.491">breakdown in the process which means</text>
  <text start="198.969" dur="6.061">they knew it was they were found out and</text>
  <text start="202.12" dur="4.739">it was completely fake we see CNN</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="3.72">falsely reported that the former FBI</text>
  <text start="206.859" dur="3.78">director James Comey would dispute</text>
  <text start="208.75" dur="5.069">president Trump&amp;#39;s claim that he was told</text>
  <text start="210.639" dur="4.921">he was not under investigation well we</text>
  <text start="213.819" dur="5.971">know that was false and we also know</text>
  <text start="215.56" dur="6.66">that Comey leaked classified memos to</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="4.83">his friend which then gave it to The</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="5.25">Times New York Times which was</text>
  <text start="224.62" dur="5.67">completely illegal and we see the whole</text>
  <text start="227.47" dur="6.12">thing falling apart we also see at last</text>
  <text start="230.29" dur="5.16">but not least Russian collusion Russian</text>
  <text start="233.59" dur="3.989">collusion it&amp;#39;s perhaps the greatest hoax</text>
  <text start="235.45" dur="5.7">perpetrated on the American people there</text>
  <text start="237.579" dur="7.201">was no collusion whatsoever now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.15" dur="8.16">very interesting is that the New York</text>
  <text start="244.78" dur="9.15">City police raided Newsweek magazine and</text>
  <text start="249.31" dur="7.019">its parent IBT media and the outline</text>
  <text start="253.93" dur="3.989">reports the reason for the visit was not</text>
  <text start="256.329" dur="4.111">clear but one employee said police were</text>
  <text start="257.919" dur="5.731">taking photos of the company&amp;#39;s servers</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="5.58">which is very interesting now it gets</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="5.25">even more interesting than this because</text>
  <text start="266.02" dur="5.28">police also visited the office in</text>
  <text start="268.9" dur="5.43">December this is coming from a former</text>
  <text start="271.3" dur="5.64">employee and they were told that it was</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="4.769">because a white substance had been</text>
  <text start="276.94" dur="4.319">mailed to executive news director Ken</text>
  <text start="279.099" dur="3.69">Lee which they were then told turn out</text>
  <text start="281.259" dur="5.791">to be a false alarm</text>
  <text start="282.789" dur="6.241">now this looks like this is a function</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="5.64">of the police where they&amp;#39;re gathering</text>
  <text start="289.03" dur="5.97">evidence then logging it taking pictures</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="3.42">of the racks the servers which I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="295" dur="2.49">know why you would take a picture of the</text>
  <text start="296.11" dur="3.75">server because you want what&amp;#39;s inside</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="4.29">the server but they also took pictures</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="5.67">of the serial number stickers and asset</text>
  <text start="301.78" dur="5.85">tags so the big question here is what</text>
  <text start="305.53" dur="4.919">are they looking for why are they</text>
  <text start="307.63" dur="6.93">gathering evidence does this have to do</text>
  <text start="310.449" dur="6.661">with Clinton because they did have a new</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="4.7">article coming out saying that Clinton</text>
  <text start="317.11" dur="4.1">can still be President</text>
  <text start="319.26" dur="5.34">is there something that&amp;#39;s on the servers</text>
  <text start="321.21" dur="5.55">that were dumped on there and they need</text>
  <text start="324.6" dur="3.9">to get that off because it&amp;#39;s damaging</text>
  <text start="326.76" dur="4.53">evidence to maybe someone in government</text>
  <text start="328.5" dur="4.74">the deep state we don&amp;#39;t know as of yet</text>
  <text start="331.29" dur="4.32">and it&amp;#39;s very interesting that the FBI</text>
  <text start="333.24" dur="4.62">was not involved but it was the New York</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="5.16">City police but we&amp;#39;ll have to watch this</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="6.36">and see where this goes now US Secretary</text>
  <text start="340.77" dur="7.68">of Education Betsy Davos announced the</text>
  <text start="344.22" dur="7.62">death of common core now she said listen</text>
  <text start="348.45" dur="4.44">the federal government tried to improve</text>
  <text start="351.84" dur="2.94">education</text>
  <text start="352.89" dur="3.36">she said we saw two presidents from</text>
  <text start="354.78" dur="3.27">different political parties and</text>
  <text start="356.25" dur="4.07">philosophies take two different</text>
  <text start="358.05" dur="4.71">approaches federally mandated</text>
  <text start="360.32" dur="4.99">assessments federal money federal</text>
  <text start="362.76" dur="5.93">standards all originated in Washington</text>
  <text start="365.31" dur="6.47">and none solved the problem too many of</text>
  <text start="368.69" dur="6.66">America&amp;#39;s students are still unprepared</text>
  <text start="371.78" dur="5.86">first we had No Child Left Behind the</text>
  <text start="375.35" dur="4.12">general consensus among federal</text>
  <text start="377.64" dur="3.12">policymakers was that greater</text>
  <text start="379.47" dur="4.23">accountability would lead to better</text>
  <text start="380.76" dur="5.16">schools highlighting America&amp;#39;s education</text>
  <text start="383.7" dur="4.23">woes had become an American pastime and</text>
  <text start="385.92" dur="4.07">they thought surely if schools were</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="4.8">forced to answer for their failures</text>
  <text start="389.99" dur="6.34">students would ultimately be better off</text>
  <text start="392.73" dur="7.91">turns out it didn&amp;#39;t it didn&amp;#39;t work at</text>
  <text start="396.33" dur="6.93">all then we had Obama the Obama</text>
  <text start="400.64" dur="4.57">administration dangled billions of</text>
  <text start="403.26" dur="5.04">dollars through the race to the top</text>
  <text start="405.21" dur="5.67">competition and then the grand making</text>
  <text start="408.3" dur="5.48">process not so subtly encouraged States</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="5.91">to adopt the Common Core State Standards</text>
  <text start="413.78" dur="6.46">with a price tag price tag of nearly</text>
  <text start="416.79" dur="5.67">four and a half billion dollars it was</text>
  <text start="420.24" dur="5.73">billed as the largest ever federal</text>
  <text start="422.46" dur="5.88">investment in school reform now when it</text>
  <text start="425.97" dur="4.77">first came out they said yes this is</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="5.28">what we need we need an educational</text>
  <text start="430.74" dur="5.31">system and it&amp;#39;s all calm in court sounds</text>
  <text start="433.62" dur="5.28">fantastic but it was never tested it was</text>
  <text start="436.05" dur="7.41">never it was never a critique created by</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="8.19">teachers and they spent hundreds of</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="8.16">millions of dollars in doing this now</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="8.64">years later we&amp;#39;ve had tests to see how</text>
  <text start="451.62" dur="4.8">our children have been doing and despite</text>
  <text start="455.73" dur="2.67">the change</text>
  <text start="456.42" dur="3.33">despite this common core where</text>
  <text start="458.4" dur="3.39">everyone&amp;#39;s going to learn which we</text>
  <text start="459.75" dur="4.47">talked about in great length and many</text>
  <text start="461.79" dur="4.62">many reports ago about how this is not</text>
  <text start="464.22" dur="4.95">going to help Society it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="5.96">actually dumb down America and this is</text>
  <text start="469.17" dur="6.75">exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing basically</text>
  <text start="472.37" dur="7.68">reading and science they didn&amp;#39;t improve</text>
  <text start="475.92" dur="9.81">at all actually the math scores dropped</text>
  <text start="480.05" dur="8.44">dramatically it didn&amp;#39;t work actually the</text>
  <text start="485.73" dur="5.81">founding fathers they talked about</text>
  <text start="488.49" dur="5.49">education and they said the best</text>
  <text start="491.54" dur="7.06">education is to have the local</text>
  <text start="493.98" dur="5.939">communities the parents decide what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.6" dur="5.37">best for their children</text>
  <text start="499.919" dur="4.921">and guess what who&amp;#39;s gonna want the best</text>
  <text start="503.97" dur="4.68">for their children</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="7.14">but a mother and a father the community</text>
  <text start="508.65" dur="5.67">as a whole and they wanted it at this</text>
  <text start="511.98" dur="4.499">low level they didn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="514.32" dur="4.26">government to decide what type of</text>
  <text start="516.479" dur="5.011">education we were going to get actually</text>
  <text start="518.58" dur="6.96">ever since the part of Education was put</text>
  <text start="521.49" dur="6.81">into place our education has been</text>
  <text start="525.54" dur="5.7">declining ever since think about that</text>
  <text start="528.3" dur="6.75">for a second if we left it up to the</text>
  <text start="531.24" dur="6.96">communities to decide how to teach what</text>
  <text start="535.05" dur="6.66">to teach and what was good for our</text>
  <text start="538.2" dur="5.4">children we would be incredibly well</text>
  <text start="541.71" dur="4.08">today but of course those in government</text>
  <text start="543.6" dur="4.29">the deep state in the cabal they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="545.79" dur="4.91">want this they wanted a dumbed down</text>
  <text start="547.89" dur="5.61">America because they knew exactly what</text>
  <text start="550.7" dur="4.66">they were going to do in the end it was</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="4.38">called a one-world government where all</text>
  <text start="555.36" dur="5.49">the people are dumbed down and you just</text>
  <text start="557.88" dur="5.4">do what they say you can&amp;#39;t think you</text>
  <text start="560.85" dur="4.74">can&amp;#39;t make decisions all you can do is</text>
  <text start="563.28" dur="6.03">work work work work work that&amp;#39;s all they</text>
  <text start="565.59" dur="6">wanted and we can see now looking back</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="4.83">after we told you that we said this was</text>
  <text start="571.59" dur="4.32">going to happen now looking back we can</text>
  <text start="574.14" dur="3.99">see this is exactly what they were</text>
  <text start="575.91" dur="4.38">trying to do remember they were trying</text>
  <text start="578.13" dur="4.59">to push the TPP they were gonna place</text>
  <text start="580.29" dur="4.02">court systems that were above the</text>
  <text start="582.72" dur="3.18">government&amp;#39;s would which would</text>
  <text start="584.31" dur="4.98">tell the governments what to do that is</text>
  <text start="585.9" dur="7.59">a one-world government and the whole</text>
  <text start="589.29" dur="8.07">thing is falling apart we see the entire</text>
  <text start="593.49" dur="6.78">meeting up in Vancouver is a complete</text>
  <text start="597.36" dur="5.63">force because North Korea and South</text>
  <text start="600.27" dur="7.05">Korea they&amp;#39;re talking to each other</text>
  <text start="602.99" dur="7.21">they&amp;#39;re trying to get together talk to</text>
  <text start="607.32" dur="5.459">each other and go in the right direction</text>
  <text start="610.2" dur="3.9">and if the United States and the</text>
  <text start="612.779" dur="2.511">coalition forces and all these other</text>
  <text start="614.1" dur="5.25">countries stay out of their business</text>
  <text start="615.29" dur="8.62">guess what they can decide on how to</text>
  <text start="619.35" dur="8.01">proceed to the next level of discussions</text>
  <text start="623.91" dur="4.5">but again the Cabal the deep state they</text>
  <text start="627.36" dur="2.7">don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="628.41" dur="5.76">this is why they didn&amp;#39;t invite Russia</text>
  <text start="630.06" dur="6.51">and China into the talks in Vancouver</text>
  <text start="634.17" dur="6.18">because they don&amp;#39;t want a solution they</text>
  <text start="636.57" dur="6.63">want war now Trump made this very</text>
  <text start="640.35" dur="5.52">interesting statement he says Russia is</text>
  <text start="643.2" dur="5.04">not helping us at all with North Korea</text>
  <text start="645.87" dur="4.91">and of course the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="648.24" dur="5.16">there saying that you know Russia is</text>
  <text start="650.78" dur="4.9">bypassing the sanctions helping North</text>
  <text start="653.4" dur="5.04">Korea and it sounds really bad but you</text>
  <text start="655.68" dur="5.67">really need to understand what Trump</text>
  <text start="658.44" dur="7.17">actually really does when he says these</text>
  <text start="661.35" dur="7.05">things there&amp;#39;s little tidbits of things</text>
  <text start="665.61" dur="4.979">in there because he&amp;#39;s a very smart</text>
  <text start="668.4" dur="5.31">businessman he knows how to make deals</text>
  <text start="670.589" dur="7.081">and he knows how to maneuver these</text>
  <text start="673.71" dur="7.14">idiots in corporate in the corporate</text>
  <text start="677.67" dur="4.89">media and government remember these</text>
  <text start="680.85" dur="3.39">politicians they they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="682.56" dur="3.87">politicians they they really have no</text>
  <text start="684.24" dur="4.349">background in much of anything maybe</text>
  <text start="686.43" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s a few but most of them they</text>
  <text start="688.589" dur="3.331">really don&amp;#39;t know much they&amp;#39;re really in</text>
  <text start="689.94" dur="4.8">there for themselves and that&amp;#39;s all they</text>
  <text start="691.92" dur="8.43">think about so let&amp;#39;s listen to what he</text>
  <text start="694.74" dur="8.039">said and why he said it now Trump is</text>
  <text start="700.35" dur="4.29">blaming Russia for fault for failing to</text>
  <text start="702.779" dur="2.31">wrench it up economic pressure on North</text>
  <text start="704.64" dur="2.58">Korea</text>
  <text start="705.089" dur="5.011">he said Russia is not helping us at all</text>
  <text start="707.22" dur="5.91">with North Korea Trump also complained</text>
  <text start="710.1" dur="6.6">that Russia was filling in the economic</text>

  <text start="889.82" dur="5.519">the corporate media the Cabal is great</text>

  <text start="895.339" dur="5.611">they&amp;#39;ve been using for a very long time</text>
  <text start="897.589" dur="5.821">now if misinformation doesn&amp;#39;t work and</text>
  <text start="900.95" dur="5.91">the Cabal the deeps they can&amp;#39;t get what</text>
  <text start="903.41" dur="5.81">they want they tried to push their</text>

  <text start="909.22" dur="5.8">trying different tactics to get the</text>
  <text start="913.16" dur="5.57">other country to react now one of those</text>
  <text start="915.02" dur="8.34">tactics was having drones attack a</text>
  <text start="918.73" dur="6.19">Russian base in Syria and this was a</text>
  <text start="923.36" dur="4.32">multiple drone attack and we discussed</text>
  <text start="924.92" dur="5.18">this before but Russia was able to</text>
  <text start="927.68" dur="4.8">pretty much destroy the drones and</text>
  <text start="930.1" dur="6.67">actually take control electronically and</text>
  <text start="932.48" dur="6.84">land the drones now they&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="936.77" dur="5.759">at these drones and what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="939.32" dur="7.56">saying is that it really looks like this</text>
  <text start="942.529" dur="6.961">is the CIA they said sophisticated</text>
  <text start="946.88" dur="5.19">technology and a Ukrainian connection</text>
  <text start="949.49" dur="5.82">indicate that the swarm attack with 13</text>
  <text start="952.07" dur="5.43">unmanned aerial vehicles was not the</text>
  <text start="955.31" dur="6.87">work solely of a Syrian anti-government</text>
  <text start="957.5" dur="9.48">militant group those captured intact</text>
  <text start="962.18" dur="7.68">UAVs provide information forensic</text>
  <text start="966.98" dur="6">information about who authored the plot</text>
  <text start="969.86" dur="5.849">now they release some images of the UAVs</text>
  <text start="972.98" dur="4.979">and these are rudimentary construction</text>
  <text start="975.709" dur="4.921">looks like plywood and things like that</text>
  <text start="977.959" dur="4.591">but the navigation technology and</text>
  <text start="980.63" dur="4.35">explosives onboard worse</text>
  <text start="982.55" dur="6.51">fistic ated and professionally made this</text>
  <text start="984.98" dur="6.299">was no amateurish mission the drones</text>
  <text start="989.06" dur="5.04">were unlikely to have been made by Sri</text>
  <text start="991.279" dur="7.321">Milton&amp;#39;s when they looked at it they see</text>
  <text start="994.1" dur="7.77">that the explosives were petn substances</text>
  <text start="998.6" dur="6.179">and it indicates that is from Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1001.87" dur="6.81">this is the preliminary research shows</text>
  <text start="1004.779" dur="6.391">that the PT the petn was used as a base</text>
  <text start="1008.68" dur="5.49">for an explosive substance used in the</text>
  <text start="1011.17" dur="6.06">amma which is more powerful than HEC</text>
  <text start="1014.17" dur="4.789">Sojin the specified explosive is</text>
  <text start="1017.23" dur="6.24">produced in a number of countries</text>
  <text start="1018.959" dur="7.331">Ukraine is one of those places and that</text>
  <text start="1023.47" dur="5.94">points to the Americans as the bridging</text>
  <text start="1026.29" dur="5.73">agency between Ukraine and Syria another</text>
  <text start="1029.41" dur="5.299">key factor is that at the time of the</text>
  <text start="1032.02" dur="5.909">attacks the Russians detected a u.s.</text>
  <text start="1034.709" dur="4.841">poseidon&amp;#39;s surveillance aircraft which</text>
  <text start="1037.929" dur="5.041">was flying very close to where the</text>
  <text start="1039.55" dur="5.399">drones were and they would have the</text>
  <text start="1042.97" dur="4.07">ability to guide the drones to the</text>
  <text start="1044.949" dur="6.151">precise location of the Russian bases</text>
  <text start="1047.04" dur="7.45">now normally the u.s. Navy fleet has</text>
  <text start="1051.1" dur="9.18">these planes they&amp;#39;re commonly thought as</text>
  <text start="1054.49" dur="9.569">a US Navy fleet plane but the CIA they</text>
  <text start="1060.28" dur="7.92">have their own Poseidon aircraft and we</text>
  <text start="1064.059" dur="8.25">know the CIA they would use it on a</text>
  <text start="1068.2" dur="8.06">Russian base now the question is what</text>
  <text start="1072.309" dur="7.681">were they trying to do the objective was</text>
  <text start="1076.26" dur="4.9">trying to get Turkey involved in this</text>
  <text start="1079.99" dur="5.189">Detroit they were trying to make it look</text>
  <text start="1081.16" dur="5.49">like it came from Turkey to try to sever</text>
  <text start="1085.179" dur="4.411">the relationship between Turkey and</text>
  <text start="1086.65" dur="7.529">Russia and trying to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="1089.59" dur="6.78">on Russia now the other thing that we</text>
  <text start="1094.179" dur="7.141">need to look at is they might have used</text>
  <text start="1096.37" dur="8.25">these drones to test to see how the</text>
  <text start="1101.32" dur="6.77">Russian air defenses actually work what</text>
  <text start="1104.62" dur="7.59">signals they send out how they perform</text>
  <text start="1108.09" dur="7.73">it might have been a test to see what</text>
  <text start="1112.21" dur="6.13">they can do later on now we</text>
  <text start="1115.82" dur="5.73">see out in Syria there&amp;#39;s been reports</text>
  <text start="1118.34" dur="5.52">that this new Kurdish 30,000 force this</text>
  <text start="1121.55" dur="4.35">Border Guard forces heading towards the</text>
  <text start="1123.86" dur="4.62">border turkeys out there screaming and</text>
  <text start="1125.9" dur="5.52">yelling saying that they will attack</text>
  <text start="1128.48" dur="7.26">unless the u.s. draws support for the</text>
  <text start="1131.42" dur="8.31">Kurdish force and the Syrians are saying</text>
  <text start="1135.74" dur="8.13">listen if turkey invades we will destroy</text>
  <text start="1139.73" dur="7.62">their planes their troops their tanks we</text>
  <text start="1143.87" dur="7.62">will attack and the Syrian Air Defense</text>
  <text start="1147.35" dur="6.09">is ready to go so it looks like what the</text>
  <text start="1151.49" dur="2.91">cabal wants with this information that</text>
  <text start="1153.44" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re putting out in the corporate</text>
  <text start="1154.4" dur="5.28">media then it was picked up they want</text>
  <text start="1156.74" dur="5.43">something to happen here now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1159.68" dur="3.96">interesting is that Tillerson and Trump</text>
  <text start="1162.17" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re going back from forth with</text>
  <text start="1163.64" dur="4.8">good-cop bad-cop and they&amp;#39;re keeping the</text>
  <text start="1165.83" dur="4.65">Cabal the deep state completely confused</text>
  <text start="1168.44" dur="4.29">and what&amp;#39;s really going on here now</text>
  <text start="1170.48" dur="7.11">something very important Tillerson said</text>
  <text start="1172.73" dur="7.23">that he denied that the United States</text>
  <text start="1177.59" dur="5.67">had any intention to build a Syria</text>
  <text start="1179.96" dur="7.01">Turkey border for saying the issue which</text>
  <text start="1183.26" dur="8.63">got Turkey all riled up has been miss</text>
  <text start="1186.97" dur="7.57">portrayed misrepresented misinformation</text>
  <text start="1191.89" dur="4.44">think about that for a second miss</text>
  <text start="1194.54" dur="5.01">information</text>
  <text start="1196.33" dur="6.9">now Tillerson was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="1199.55" dur="7.59">the US troops will remain in syria to</text>
  <text start="1203.23" dur="5.05">stop the resurrection of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1207.14" dur="2.73">state now the corporate media was out</text>
  <text start="1208.28" dur="3.3">there saying that there it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1209.87" dur="3.24">open-ended policy we&amp;#39;re never leaving</text>
  <text start="1211.58" dur="2.27">Syria no that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1213.11" dur="4.44">here</text>
  <text start="1213.85" dur="6.43">what he&amp;#39;s saying is that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1217.55" dur="6.33">going to be in Syria right now to make</text>
  <text start="1220.28" dur="8.43">sure the Cabal does not have the ability</text>
  <text start="1223.88" dur="7.92">to resurrect the Islamic state and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1228.71" dur="6.27">saying that if the US did withdraw from</text>
  <text start="1231.8" dur="5.58">Syria it would help Assad and give Iran</text>
  <text start="1234.98" dur="3.09">an opportunity to strengthen its role in</text>
  <text start="1237.38" dur="2.25">the region</text>
  <text start="1238.07" dur="5.48">you know let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="1239.63" dur="7.83">second Iran is already in the region</text>
  <text start="1243.55" dur="5.95">Assad already has the upper hand I mean</text>
  <text start="1247.46" dur="3.9">the United States staying in</text>
  <text start="1249.5" dur="4.29">Syria doesn&amp;#39;t stop Assad from running</text>
  <text start="1251.36" dur="4.59">the country doesn&amp;#39;t stop Assad from</text>
  <text start="1253.79" dur="5.25">anything actually if the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1255.95" dur="8.91">no longer exists if al-qaeda no longer</text>
  <text start="1259.04" dur="9.48">exists why would the u.s. stay in Syria</text>
  <text start="1264.86" dur="8.91">for a little bit longer to stop the</text>
  <text start="1268.52" dur="7.32">Cabal to keep Assad in power by keeping</text>
  <text start="1273.77" dur="4.56">the rebels member they&amp;#39;re not funded</text>
  <text start="1275.84" dur="4.44">anymore the moderate rebels the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1278.33" dur="4.23">state they&amp;#39;re out of the picture pretty</text>
  <text start="1280.28" dur="5.84">much al Qaeda pretty much out of the</text>
  <text start="1282.56" dur="9.3">picture if the u.s. stays in there and</text>
  <text start="1286.12" dur="6.91">it&amp;#39;s not part of the Cabal where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1291.86" dur="1.8">actually fighting against the Islamic</text>

  <text start="1293.66" dur="5.91">it holds the country intact right now</text>
  <text start="1298.04" dur="3.39">now I&amp;#39;m in saying this is a situation</text>
  <text start="1299.57" dur="4.38">where the u.s. is going to stay forever</text>
  <text start="1301.43" dur="5.37">I think they&amp;#39;ve worked out a deal with</text>
  <text start="1303.95" dur="6.87">Russia with Syria to stay in there until</text>
  <text start="1306.8" dur="6.54">the Cabal is completely gone once the</text>
  <text start="1310.82" dur="5.28">Cabal is completely gone the United</text>
  <text start="1313.34" dur="5.43">States will leave they actually sent</text>
  <text start="1316.1" dur="6.78">some of the soldiers out of the US right</text>
  <text start="1318.77" dur="7.14">now Tilson also explained that the US</text>
  <text start="1322.88" dur="6.09">needs Russia&amp;#39;s cooperation in order to</text>
  <text start="1325.91" dur="6.57">strengthen the de-escalation area in the</text>
  <text start="1328.97" dur="6.6">south western Syria area so we see</text>
  <text start="1332.48" dur="5.25">already that what the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="1335.57" dur="5.66">putting out and what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="1337.73" dur="6.84">are two separate and different things</text>
  <text start="1341.23" dur="5.92">because the Cabal is being hammered from</text>
  <text start="1344.57" dur="4.32">all different directions right now we</text>
  <text start="1347.15" dur="4.77">see the CDC they were going to have</text>
  <text start="1348.89" dur="5.43">these new talks on January 16th they</text>
  <text start="1351.92" dur="4.26">cancelled it and they didn&amp;#39;t cancel it</text>
  <text start="1354.32" dur="3.3">because of what happened in Hawaii they</text>
  <text start="1356.18" dur="3.72">actually cancelled it before that</text>
  <text start="1357.62" dur="4.83">happened but they&amp;#39;re saying that they</text>
  <text start="1359.9" dur="4.23">canceled it because they have a more</text>
  <text start="1362.45" dur="4.68">pressing issue and that is the flu</text>
  <text start="1364.13" dur="5.07">epidemic in the United States and that</text>
  <text start="1367.13" dur="4.11">was the reason they gave now I just</text>
  <text start="1369.2" dur="6.48">wanted to go over a little bit of</text>
  <text start="1371.24" dur="5.79">different points of Q and what he parts</text>

  <text start="1380.03" dur="2.8">and I&amp;#39;m going to be doing this</text>
  <text start="1382.16" dur="3.04">throughout</text>
