  <text start="106.93" dur="5.1">holiday season most likely is going to</text>
  <text start="109.6" dur="3.659">be a complete and utter disaster for</text>
  <text start="112.03" dur="2.79">retail and that has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="113.259" dur="3.661">online sales I know people are gonna</text>
  <text start="114.82" dur="4.2">start to bring that up that yes online</text>
  <text start="116.92" dur="3.629">is doing a lot better even if it does</text>
  <text start="119.02" dur="5.13">and they tell you this billions of</text>
  <text start="120.549" dur="5.46">dollars increase in online sales</text>
  <text start="124.15" dur="4.109">remember it retails a trillion dollar</text>
  <text start="126.009" dur="5.79">business and this is a very small</text>
  <text start="128.259" dur="5.82">fraction of the retail industry but we</text>
  <text start="131.799" dur="3.571">can see already that stores are really</text>
  <text start="134.079" dur="3.271">getting hit and I think this is going to</text>
  <text start="135.37" dur="3.39">get worse as time goes on the corporate</text>
  <text start="137.35" dur="3.3">media I know is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="138.76" dur="4.259">you know look at the lines on Black</text>

  <text start="143.019" dur="4.53">are out there shopping but again we</text>
  <text start="145.69" dur="3.12">don&amp;#39;t have the real numbers all we have</text>
  <text start="147.549" dur="3.391">is the corporate media out there pushing</text>
  <text start="148.81" dur="3.69">propaganda trying to get to pee trying</text>
  <text start="150.94" dur="3.9">to get the everyday person out there to</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="4.98">shop but we see right now that j.crew</text>
  <text start="154.84" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re saying that listen sales are not</text>
  <text start="157.48" dur="3.84">good whatsoever they&amp;#39;re down 12% in the</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="2.88">third quarter they&amp;#39;re gonna be worse</text>
  <text start="161.32" dur="2.88">probably in the fourth quarter we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="162.94" dur="3.359">gonna be able to keep things going and</text>
  <text start="164.2" dur="4.62">moving along here we&amp;#39;re gonna be closing</text>
  <text start="166.299" dur="4.201">50 more stores and I think we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="168.82" dur="3.449">see a lot more retailers come out and</text>
  <text start="170.5" dur="3.84">say you know something we just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.269" dur="3.961">have a good Christmas a good holiday</text>
  <text start="174.34" dur="4.35">season and we&amp;#39;re gonna start closing</text>
  <text start="176.23" dur="3.81">some stores here we&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="2.699">stores closed since the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="180.04" dur="3.93">of the year and I think it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="181.389" dur="5.341">continue on as we move forward we see</text>
  <text start="183.97" dur="6.48">you already that just 10 companies</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="6.36">for 33% of all market gains now was very</text>
  <text start="190.45" dur="5.16">interesting is why would PE rise at a</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="5.729">time when the Fed is tightening now so</text>
  <text start="195.61" dur="4.89">Jen speculated assuming that analysts</text>
  <text start="198.819" dur="3.691">have not factored tax reform into their</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="5.31">earnings forecast tax reform</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="6.089">expectations have been the driver for of</text>
  <text start="205.81" dur="3.12">PE expansion now there is a problem with</text>
  <text start="208.599" dur="3.451">this</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="5.24">while the sp500 index rate is currently</text>
  <text start="212.05" dur="4.499">around twenty six point six percent</text>
  <text start="214.17" dur="3.52">assuming that the US companies generate</text>
  <text start="216.549" dur="3.031">around forty three percent of their</text>
  <text start="217.69" dur="4.35">profits abroad and paid thirty five</text>
  <text start="219.58" dur="4.8">percent of their US profits on taxes the</text>
  <text start="222.04" dur="4.37">average tax rate outside the US would be</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="4.32">around fifteen point five percent a</text>
  <text start="226.41" dur="4.299">decrease in the u.s. tax from thirty</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="3.99">five to twenty percent as planned by</text>
  <text start="230.709" dur="4.051">Trump&amp;#39;s tax reform would thus</text>
  <text start="232.69" dur="5.19">theoretically boost earnings by eight</text>
  <text start="234.76" dur="6.24">point five percent the 12-month Ford PE</text>
  <text start="237.88" dur="4.02">has risen by twelve percent over the</text>
  <text start="241" dur="2.91">last twelve months</text>
  <text start="241.9" dur="5.13">in other words roughly a hundred and</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="6.75">fifty percent of trumps tax cuts have</text>
  <text start="247.03" dur="8.01">been priced in now so Jen calculated</text>
  <text start="250.66" dur="6.359">that ten contributors of the sp500 bull</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="5.61">run have accounted for thirty three</text>
  <text start="257.019" dur="6.091">percent of the S&amp;amp;P 500 performance now</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="5.01">tying everything together the bank also</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="4.38">points out that all of the companies</text>
  <text start="265.66" dur="4.2">listed below have been have seen their</text>
  <text start="267.49" dur="7.37">PE expand over the last 12 months in</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="8.49">some cases Walmart Boeing Amazon have</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="5.65">dramatically increased their PE in fact</text>
  <text start="278.35" dur="4.35">only three companies Apple and two banks</text>
  <text start="280.51" dur="5.31">have 12-month PE s that are below the</text>
  <text start="282.7" dur="5.46">market average so when we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="3.599">this we have to wonder what is going on</text>
  <text start="288.16" dur="3.15">here and I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="289.419" dur="3.391">manipulation I think there&amp;#39;s a lot that</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="3.69">we don&amp;#39;t know behind the scenes and</text>
  <text start="292.81" dur="4.229">again when things start to crash and</text>
  <text start="295" dur="5.34">fall apart this is when the truth starts</text>
  <text start="297.039" dur="6.271">to really come out we see the u.s. PMI</text>
  <text start="300.34" dur="6.18">has tumbled to four-month lows which</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="5.609">signals around a two percent GDP growth</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="4.01">and remember GDP has been manipulated</text>
  <text start="308.919" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;ve gone all the way back to 1929</text>
  <text start="310.53" dur="4.389">included research and development and</text>
  <text start="312.729" dur="3.091">manipulated GDP numbers even further</text>
  <text start="314.919" dur="2.941">than that</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="4.47">and we can see that a lot of the GDP</text>
  <text start="317.86" dur="4.62">about 70% of it is made up of retail</text>
  <text start="320.29" dur="5.1">spending now if retail is doing poorly</text>
  <text start="322.48" dur="5.1">how were these GDP numbers moving up we</text>
  <text start="325.39" dur="5.55">also know that health care and of course</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="5.76">with Obamacare that really boosted GDP</text>
  <text start="330.94" dur="6.3">because as premiums go up guess what so</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="5.25">does GDP so we also see that that / US</text>
  <text start="337.24" dur="4.83">service business activity</text>
  <text start="338.59" dur="5.79">well that hit a low a four-month low we</text>
  <text start="342.07" dur="5.34">see US manufacturing PMI it&amp;#39;s at a</text>
  <text start="344.38" dur="6.27">two-month low US manufacturing output is</text>
  <text start="347.41" dur="5.28">it at - is at a two-month low and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.65" dur="5.16">starting to see that things aren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="352.69" dur="6.21">as well as everyone thinks now we</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="5.1">understand that we have a lot of debt</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="4.68">not just here in the United States but</text>
  <text start="360.91" dur="3.9">around the world and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="363.58" dur="3.75">debt here in the United States we can</text>
  <text start="364.81" dur="4.5">see that the gross national debt in the</text>
  <text start="367.33" dur="6">US hit around twenty point five trillion</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="6.96">or 105 percent of GDP but when we look</text>
  <text start="373.33" dur="8.73">at Japan their national debt is around</text>
  <text start="376.27" dur="7.65">250 250 percent of GDP but whose debt</text>
  <text start="382.06" dur="5.55">bubble is going to burst</text>
  <text start="383.92" dur="6.48">first well China is now where Japan was</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="7.08">before it&amp;#39;s credible bubble blew up in</text>
  <text start="390.4" dur="8.52">the early 90s but guess what Canada</text>
  <text start="394.69" dur="8.25">Canada rules their private sector debt</text>
  <text start="398.92" dur="6.66">in Canada has more than doubled from 2.2</text>
  <text start="402.94" dur="5.28">trillion in 2006 to four point five</text>
  <text start="405.58" dur="6.47">trillion and private sector debt as a</text>
  <text start="408.22" dur="8.49">parent as a percent of GDP has soared to</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="7.96">217 percent and guess what this is</text>
  <text start="416.71" dur="5.28">within a hair of where Japan was in the</text>
  <text start="420.01" dur="5.91">third quarter of 93 before the credit</text>
  <text start="421.99" dur="6.42">bubble imploded so who&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="425.92" dur="5.82">first it looks like Canada is leading</text>
  <text start="428.41" dur="5.04">the pack right now now everyone&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="431.74" dur="3.51">there saying well yeah we see a lot of</text>
  <text start="433.45" dur="4.26">debt we see that the economy is not</text>
  <text start="435.25" dur="4.89">doing well but we see all we also see</text>
  <text start="437.71" dur="4.62">the manipulation and I think the central</text>
  <text start="440.14" dur="4.47">bank can keep this going forever well a</text>
  <text start="442.33" dur="3.42">lot of people said that back in 2008</text>
  <text start="444.61" dur="2.61">where they thought everything was going</text>
  <text start="445.75" dur="3.99">to continue on forever and Eric actually</text>
  <text start="447.22" dur="4.74">back then everyone believed the illusion</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="3.78">that everything was great we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="451.96" dur="3.57">looking at everything right now we know</text>
  <text start="453.52" dur="4.44">that things are not going well we know</text>
  <text start="455.53" dur="5.25">that inflation is starting to creep up</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="4.769">everything behind the scenes of what the</text>
  <text start="460.78" dur="3.479">Fed and the government is telling us we</text>
  <text start="462.729" dur="3.631">see that things are really breaking down</text>
  <text start="464.259" dur="3.72">very quickly now I know we have the</text>
  <text start="466.36" dur="3.51">crypto market we have the gold market</text>
  <text start="467.979" dur="4.351">and people saying they I forget about</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="5.28">gold let&amp;#39;s go to crypto I think all of</text>
  <text start="472.33" dur="5.399">these are important in their own way</text>
  <text start="475.15" dur="5.1">where crypto which is an electronic form</text>
  <text start="477.729" dur="7.171">of currency which I believe will be</text>
  <text start="480.25" dur="6.69">great for decentralization it will take</text>
  <text start="484.9" dur="4.71">the power away from the Fed if they</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="5.159">don&amp;#39;t get their hands around it and I</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="4.529">think it puts the creation of currency</text>
  <text start="492.099" dur="3.75">back into the people&amp;#39;s hands and plus</text>
  <text start="494.139" dur="4.141">it&amp;#39;s electronic so it&amp;#39;s very easy to use</text>
  <text start="495.849" dur="5.88">around the world and no one is dependent</text>
  <text start="498.28" dur="6">on a centralized system I also think</text>
  <text start="501.729" dur="5.011">gold silver and other precious metals</text>
  <text start="504.28" dur="4.949">are very good to have I mean there are</text>
  <text start="506.74" dur="3.329">many reasons why gold is very good it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.229" dur="3.411">tangible</text>
  <text start="510.069" dur="5.431">with inherent value there is no</text>
  <text start="512.64" dur="5.529">counterparty risk it&amp;#39;s a store of value</text>
  <text start="515.5" dur="4.829">and it&amp;#39;s been a store of value for a</text>
  <text start="518.169" dur="6.571">very long time it&amp;#39;s a long-term</text>
  <text start="520.329" dur="7.741">inflation hedge it has a 16 a 6,000 year</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="7.08">history a 2,500 year track record as</text>
  <text start="528.07" dur="6.209">money it&amp;#39;s a safe haven and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.82" dur="5.55">portable anonymous wealth where you can</text>
  <text start="534.279" dur="6.631">take these gold coins deep physical bars</text>
  <text start="537.37" dur="4.8">and you don&amp;#39;t have to you know nobody</text>
  <text start="540.91" dur="3.84">can really track this it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="542.17" dur="5.06">difficult to track and you can move it</text>
  <text start="544.75" dur="5.49">from one area to another plus it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="547.23" dur="7.27">universally accepted in all different</text>
  <text start="550.24" dur="6.75">areas and yes when you purchase gold</text>
  <text start="554.5" dur="3.959">they be fed and the the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="3.69">they might write it down but if you get</text>
  <text start="558.459" dur="3.87">it in smaller denominations they have no</text>
  <text start="560.68" dur="4.469">clue that you have it if you get silver</text>
  <text start="562.329" dur="5.161">they really don&amp;#39;t have any idea that you</text>
  <text start="565.149" dur="4.231">have this and this is why they would</text>
  <text start="567.49" dur="3.48">like to go to an electronic form of</text>
  <text start="569.38" dur="2.94">their currency and I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="570.97" dur="4.08">cryptocurrency unless they come up with</text>
  <text start="572.32" dur="5.34">their coin and they force everyone to</text>
  <text start="575.05" dur="5.25">use it they can track every one but they</text>
  <text start="577.66" dur="4.11">like to use electronic version of their</text>
  <text start="580.3" dur="2.88">currency because it makes it very easy</text>
  <text start="581.77" dur="3.9">for them to</text>
  <text start="583.18" dur="4.83">in you it makes it very easy to track</text>
  <text start="585.67" dur="4.05">all your purchases because you&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="588.01" dur="5.1">your debit card to your credit card and</text>
  <text start="589.72" dur="4.89">we see right now that there&amp;#39;s reasons to</text>
  <text start="593.11" dur="3.21">have gold there&amp;#39;s reasons to have</text>
  <text start="594.61" dur="2.43">cryptocurrency because depending on the</text>
  <text start="596.32" dur="3.57">situation</text>
  <text start="597.04" dur="6.24">you&amp;#39;re gonna need both and we see that</text>
  <text start="599.89" dur="5.25">the situation is changing very rapidly I</text>
