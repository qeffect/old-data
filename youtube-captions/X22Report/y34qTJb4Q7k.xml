  <text start="214.18" dur="9.509">about having a free trade deal and they</text>
  <text start="221.26" dur="6.24">are walking their respective trade teams</text>
  <text start="223.689" dur="6.54">through a process to deliver a US UK</text>
  <text start="227.5" dur="5.129">trade deal on the day after a No Deal</text>
  <text start="230.229" dur="5.4">brexit is scheduled to have an October</text>
  <text start="232.629" dur="4.98">thirty-first it will be an interim trade</text>
  <text start="235.629" dur="6.03">agreement that goes into effect November</text>
  <text start="237.609" dur="6.9">1st 2019 think about what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="257.259" dur="6.211">bilateral trade deal ahead of the brexit</text>
  <text start="259.68" dur="5.919">this strategic approach a deal that</text>
  <text start="263.47" dur="6.15">delivers both the bragg&amp;#39;s result and the</text>
  <text start="265.599" dur="8.551">economic stability to offset any brexit</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="8.19">downside concerns think about what Trump</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="5.609">and Boers are doing here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="277.81" dur="6.63">trapping the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.759" dur="7.231">trapping the EU now what most likely</text>
  <text start="284.44" dur="5.039">they&amp;#39;re constructing is a bilateral</text>
  <text start="286.99" dur="5.7">trade deal between the US and UK that</text>
  <text start="289.479" dur="6.541">has genuine reciprocity and negligible</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="5.19">trade barriers it&amp;#39;s going to be like a</text>
  <text start="296.02" dur="4.7">free trade</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="6.69">highway between the UK and the US but</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="7.77">only between the UK and the US now with</text>
  <text start="304.57" dur="7.38">the with EU no longer in the picture and</text>
  <text start="308.49" dur="8.71">no longer to influence trade agreements</text>
  <text start="311.95" dur="8.28">involving the UK companies countries</text>
  <text start="317.2" dur="6.18">could get tariff free access to the US</text>
  <text start="320.23" dur="5.73">market by operating out of Britain and</text>
  <text start="323.38" dur="4.98">using transnational shipping through</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="5.64">Britain so everything is gonna go</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="4.07">through the UK think about this for a</text>
  <text start="331.6" dur="3.96">second</text>
  <text start="332.43" dur="5.47">eventually all corporations in the EU</text>
  <text start="335.56" dur="5.37">who wanted to do business with North</text>
  <text start="337.9" dur="6.57">America it would start operations in the</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="6.75">UK or the EU would have to drop its</text>
  <text start="344.47" dur="7.59">one-way tariff policy think about all</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="7.68">the leverage that this creates the power</text>
  <text start="352.06" dur="6.15">that this creates and what are the</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="9.63">central bankers though well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.21" dur="10.23">stuck boom so Trump and Boris they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="364.99" dur="7.14">stopped the fear-mongering they will</text>
  <text start="368.44" dur="9.03">stop the the EU they will force business</text>
  <text start="372.13" dur="9.3">into the UK and the central bankers what</text>
  <text start="377.47" dur="6.84">are they going to do think about it now</text>
  <text start="381.43" dur="9.15">Trump mentioned that the u.s. is going</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="8.37">to delay and modify the next tariffs so</text>
  <text start="390.58" dur="5.22">some of the tariffs that he was going to</text>
  <text start="392.68" dur="5.09">place on China they decided to delay</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="4.53">them right now and those include</text>
  <text start="397.77" dur="5.71">cellphones laptops video game consoles</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="6.27">and whatnot and we need to go back to</text>
  <text start="403.48" dur="5.52">Trump&amp;#39;s post he posted this today</text>
  <text start="406.6" dur="4.32">through massive devaluation of their</text>
  <text start="409" dur="4.14">currency and pumping vast sums of money</text>
  <text start="410.92" dur="4.44">into their system the tens of billions</text>
  <text start="413.14" dur="5.37">of dollars that the u.s. is receiving is</text>
  <text start="415.36" dur="5.07">a gift from China prices not up no</text>
  <text start="418.51" dur="5.04">inflation farmers getting more than</text>
  <text start="420.43" dur="6.57">China would be spending fake news won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="4.93">report now the decision to postpone and</text>
  <text start="427" dur="3.52">modify</text>
  <text start="428.48" dur="4.56">looks political from the perspective of</text>
  <text start="430.52" dur="6.27">timing additionally the use of term</text>
  <text start="433.04" dur="6.12">nextstep tariffs by light hyzer implies</text>
  <text start="436.79" dur="4.49">a sense of inevitability to a</text>
  <text start="439.16" dur="6.15">predetermined process of increasing</text>
  <text start="441.28" dur="5.86">tariffs now it appears that Trump he</text>
  <text start="445.31" dur="4.89">made this move based on a state</text>
  <text start="447.14" dur="5.67">statement by Liu he about China making</text>
  <text start="450.2" dur="4.71">good on a prior promise to purchase</text>
  <text start="452.81" dur="4.5">significant agricultural products</text>
  <text start="454.91" dur="6">what is Trump waiting for he&amp;#39;s waiting</text>
  <text start="457.31" dur="4.08">to see if they&amp;#39;re lying or they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="460.91" dur="2.46">lying</text>
  <text start="461.39" dur="3.99">so Trump has delayed these September</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="4.77">first tariffs to see if Liu he will</text>
  <text start="465.38" dur="6.66">deliver on the agricultural promise or</text>
  <text start="468.14" dur="7.74">if Jean Shan is manipulating a lie to</text>
  <text start="472.04" dur="7.23">gain breathing room now most likely</text>
  <text start="475.88" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re probably lying because they want</text>
  <text start="479.27" dur="5.79">to see what&amp;#39;s going to happen with the</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="6.6">2020 elections but the benefit to the US</text>
  <text start="485.06" dur="4.02">would mean a pending farm subsidy</text>
  <text start="487.43" dur="4.41">wouldn&amp;#39;t be needed and based on the</text>
  <text start="489.08" dur="4.8">timing of the phone contact message from</text>
  <text start="491.84" dur="3.75">China this scenario appears to be the</text>
  <text start="493.88" dur="3.78">most likely background let&amp;#39;s put the</text>
  <text start="495.59" dur="5.19">economic free trade deal plan together</text>
  <text start="497.66" dur="4.71">here trump is positioning the UK trade</text>
  <text start="500.78" dur="5.04">deal to be the ultimate leverage to</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="4.92">force the EU into negotiation Trudeau is</text>
  <text start="505.82" dur="4.47">in trouble</text>
  <text start="507.29" dur="5.85">a new report came out about him that he</text>
  <text start="510.29" dur="4.98">interfered and we know that the</text>
  <text start="513.14" dur="6.23">elections are coming up in Canada that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="515.27" dur="6.6">in October and Trump wants the u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="519.37" dur="4.98">ratified so he&amp;#39;s waiting for after the</text>
  <text start="521.87" dur="5.4">Canadian election we&amp;#39;ll see who is then</text>
  <text start="524.35" dur="5.08">president of Canada and then he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="527.27" dur="5.48">to go after the US MCA to get that</text>
  <text start="529.43" dur="6.27">ratified that will be his primary focus</text>
  <text start="532.75" dur="6.73">then Trump is going to announce a u.s.</text>
  <text start="535.7" dur="5.03">and Japan deal once all that said and</text>
  <text start="539.48" dur="6.21">done</text>
  <text start="540.73" dur="8.65">China China will be the focal point with</text>
  <text start="545.69" dur="8.37">everything else set in stone Trump is</text>
  <text start="549.38" dur="7.29">going to move in on China and he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="554.06" dur="4.53">to trap and corner China into making</text>
  <text start="556.67" dur="4.95">this deal now will it be the end of this</text>
  <text start="558.59" dur="3.38">year next year I do believe it will be</text>
