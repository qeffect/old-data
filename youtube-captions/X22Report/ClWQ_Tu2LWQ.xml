  <text start="126.12" dur="7.399">that out of the TBA C minutes it seems</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="6.78">like they were mentioning and discussing</text>
  <text start="133.519" dur="6.72">how the Federal Reserve Note might not</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="5.61">be the reserve currency of the world and</text>

  <text start="148.019" dur="4.83">be getting into that in just a minute</text>
  <text start="149.36" dur="6.82">but first out in Europe we can see that</text>
  <text start="152.849" dur="5.551">the economy out in Europe is completely</text>
  <text start="156.18" dur="6.38">breaking down they might be the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.4" dur="5.87">weakest link when we hit the economic</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="4.14">recession</text>
  <text start="164.27" dur="4.59">depression collapse of the central bank</text>
  <text start="166.7" dur="3.96">system and once again you need to</text>
  <text start="168.86" dur="5.52">remember here in the United States when</text>
  <text start="170.66" dur="5.7">you see all the data coming in for the</text>
  <text start="174.38" dur="4.62">economy and Trump is telling us how</text>
  <text start="176.36" dur="4.92">great the economy is this is an illusion</text>
  <text start="179" dur="4.53">he&amp;#39;s using these weapons against the</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="4.23">central bankers remember we&amp;#39;re still in</text>

  <text start="194.03" dur="4.83">central banks around the world but</text>
  <text start="196.64" dur="4.23">Europe is having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="198.86" dur="5.49">and what&amp;#39;s very different about Europe</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="5.7">to the United States the central bank is</text>
  <text start="204.35" dur="4.74">here in the United States we can</text>
  <text start="206.57" dur="8.07">continually create currency borrow and</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="8.1">spend the EU with the ECB they are made</text>
  <text start="214.64" dur="6.27">up of many nations something like 19</text>
  <text start="217.19" dur="6.18">nations and they don&amp;#39;t have the power</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="7.08">just to continually borrow and borrow</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="7.5">and borrow and borrow because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.99" dur="4.89">hooked into many different nations using</text>
  <text start="230.87" dur="3.21">one central bank system yes they all</text>
  <text start="232.88" dur="3.8">have their own little central bank</text>
  <text start="234.08" dur="7.26">within their country but their main</text>
  <text start="236.68" dur="8.23">source of currency is coming from the</text>
  <text start="241.34" dur="7.53">ECB but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="244.91" dur="7.14">we&amp;#39;re seeing the economy deteriorate in</text>
  <text start="248.87" dur="5.01">many of these countries and industrial</text>
  <text start="252.05" dur="4.65">production of course the 19 Nation euro</text>
  <text start="253.88" dur="6.27">area is falling at its fastest pace</text>
  <text start="256.7" dur="5.43">since the financial crisis and we can</text>
  <text start="260.15" dur="5.19">see that this is going to be a big</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="7.23">problem this leaves Europe&amp;#39;s GDP at a</text>
  <text start="265.34" dur="8.43">risk for barely reaching 1% of in 2019 a</text>
  <text start="269.36" dur="8.19">sharp slowdown from 2018 and even with</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="5.7">Germany the powerhouse of all this it is</text>
  <text start="277.55" dur="5.97">not helping they&amp;#39;re on the verge or</text>

  <text start="283.52" dur="5.7">economic numbers have consistently</text>
  <text start="285.44" dur="6.21">missed every single forecast this is not</text>
  <text start="289.22" dur="3.24">a good sign and we know and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="291.65" dur="3.36">talking about this we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="292.46" dur="5">researching it we know the truth about</text>
  <text start="295.01" dur="5.379">the economy this economy</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="6.03">is an illusion and we know the Trump and</text>
  <text start="300.389" dur="6.131">many others they&amp;#39;re preparing to make a</text>
  <text start="303.49" dur="5.37">move on the central bank system we</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="4.98">cannot stay in the central banking</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="5.16">system the way it is today it will not</text>
  <text start="311.5" dur="5.94">work it&amp;#39;s not designed to work the</text>
  <text start="314.02" dur="5.579">central bankers know this now Trump is</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="4.289">doing everything he possibly can he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.599" dur="4.831">doing a fantastic job bringing jobs back</text>
  <text start="321.729" dur="6.06">bringing manufacturing back and getting</text>
  <text start="324.43" dur="5.489">people off of the various programs and</text>
  <text start="327.789" dur="6">making them dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="329.919" dur="7.021">and he has to do this remember</text>
  <text start="333.789" dur="5.791">throughout the entire time the central</text>
  <text start="336.94" dur="5.789">bank came in to power they continually</text>
  <text start="339.58" dur="5.309">created programs which the American</text>
  <text start="342.729" dur="3.991">people became dependent on government</text>
  <text start="344.889" dur="4.681">now the founding fathers never wanted</text>
  <text start="346.72" dur="5.25">this and we can see with the various</text>
  <text start="349.57" dur="4.14">programs welfare food stamps and whatnot</text>
  <text start="351.97" dur="3.06">they needed to do this because the</text>
  <text start="353.71" dur="4.799">central bank system does not work for</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="7.05">everyone you have different levels and</text>
  <text start="358.509" dur="5.641">most of the people well they knew that</text>
  <text start="362.08" dur="4.649">it was not going to work for them so</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="4.079">they had to create these programs to</text>
  <text start="366.729" dur="3.271">allow these people to live and if</text>
  <text start="368.229" dur="2.731">they&amp;#39;re dependent on government and</text>
  <text start="370" dur="1.949">they&amp;#39;re getting their check and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.96" dur="2.67">getting their food stamps and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="371.949" dur="4.051">getting everything else they won&amp;#39;t say a</text>
  <text start="373.63" dur="5.55">word it&amp;#39;s much easier to control the</text>
  <text start="376" dur="4.83">people but right now more than 1.4</text>
  <text start="379.18" dur="6.18">million households dropped off the food</text>
  <text start="380.83" dur="7.38">stamps since Trump came into office what</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="5.279">does this tell us this tells us there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.21" dur="5.22">a lot less people that are dependent on</text>
  <text start="390.639" dur="4.59">government now can he just get rid of</text>
  <text start="393.43" dur="3.87">all the people and make them all not</text>
  <text start="395.229" dur="4.201">dependent on government now that would</text>
  <text start="397.3" dur="4.679">be impossible but he needs to reduce the</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="5.64">numbers quite a bit and there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="401.979" dur="5.071">for this because when we move to a new</text>

  <text start="705.2" dur="6.36">you really do the math and you really</text>
  <text start="708.92" dur="6.3">look at what&amp;#39;s going on you can see</text>
  <text start="711.56" dur="7.41">they&amp;#39;re completely wrong think about</text>
  <text start="715.22" dur="7.23">what has happened here two-thirds of</text>

  <text start="726.79" dur="5.83">smaller refund check merely indicates</text>
  <text start="729.71" dur="5.13">that early tax filers overpaid their</text>
  <text start="732.62" dur="4.71">taxes by a smaller amount throughout the</text>
  <text start="734.84" dur="4.92">year in other words taxpayers kept more</text>

  <text start="744.26" dur="3.87">seem like a bonus to some taxpayers but</text>
  <text start="746.69" dur="3.69">it is merely a sign that taxes were</text>
  <text start="748.13" dur="4.89">overpaid during the year essentially a</text>
  <text start="750.38" dur="4.04">taxpayer who gets a large refund gave an</text>
  <text start="753.02" dur="4.32">interest-free loan to the government</text>
  <text start="754.42" dur="5.5">that money would have been better used</text>
  <text start="757.34" dur="6.09">if it had gone toward paying down bills</text>
  <text start="759.92" dur="4.98">or been saved in a bank that paid</text>
  <text start="763.43" dur="3.18">interest and we know that there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="764.9" dur="3.72">much interest in a bank today but it</text>

  <text start="776.21" dur="6.18">jr. pointed this out and reply to Harris</text>
  <text start="779.09" dur="5.34">of course refunds are down people are</text>
  <text start="782.39" dur="4.68">paying less in taxes and the code is</text>
  <text start="784.43" dur="5.01">simplified a refund means you overpaid</text>
  <text start="787.07" dur="5.19">and got money back when you pay less the</text>
  <text start="789.44" dur="6.18">refund will be less do you really not</text>
  <text start="792.26" dur="8">understand that now do the effect of</text>

  <text start="809.99" dur="5.099">that Trump he&amp;#39;s been contradicting the</text>
  <text start="812.48" dur="4.56">Fed and I do believe that he is in</text>
  <text start="815.089" dur="3.601">control of the Fed q has been telling us</text>
  <text start="817.04" dur="4.07">that the Fed is going to be restructured</text>
  <text start="818.69" dur="5.22">and gold is going to bring down the Fed</text>
  <text start="821.11" dur="5.26">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that Italy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="823.91" dur="5.55">salvini he&amp;#39;s calling for the end</text>
  <text start="826.37" dur="5.73">of Italy&amp;#39;s central bank he&amp;#39;s called for</text>
  <text start="829.46" dur="6.6">the elimination of the central bank and</text>
  <text start="832.1" dur="6.51">prison prison time for fraudsters now</text>
  <text start="836.06" dur="5.34">the message that went out some people</text>
  <text start="838.61" dur="6.06">are saying that well it was translated</text>
  <text start="841.4" dur="6.18">you know incorrectly he might be saying</text>
  <text start="844.67" dur="5.79">that we should restructure the central</text>
  <text start="847.58" dur="4.62">bank but yes those fraudsters should</text>
  <text start="850.46" dur="5.1">still go to prison but what he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="852.2" dur="6.51">saying he&amp;#39;s saying listen we need to</text>
  <text start="855.56" dur="4.74">take the corruption out of this I mean</text>
  <text start="858.71" dur="4.17">if we have to get rid of all the people</text>
  <text start="860.3" dur="4.2">and restructure it so be it I believe</text>
  <text start="862.88" dur="3.03">that&amp;#39;s almost the same thing Q was</text>
  <text start="864.5" dur="3.99">saying that there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="865.91" dur="5.46">restructuring remember the source of the</text>
  <text start="868.49" dur="5.07">corruption comes from the free creation</text>
  <text start="871.37" dur="5.58">of currency with no checks and balances</text>
  <text start="873.56" dur="5.82">and that is the Federal Reserve the ECB</text>
  <text start="876.95" dur="4.26">and all the central bank&amp;#39;s throughout</text>
  <text start="879.38" dur="4.05">the world remember Q has been telling us</text>
  <text start="881.21" dur="4.8">that all these central banks are</text>
  <text start="883.43" dur="4.82">Rothschild controlled there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="886.01" dur="4.38">why Q has been telling us this now</text>
  <text start="888.25" dur="4.27">something very interesting the Treasury</text>
  <text start="890.39" dur="5.16">boring Advisory Committee they publish</text>
  <text start="892.52" dur="6.18">minutes to its quarterly refunding</text>
  <text start="895.55" dur="5.58">decision two weeks ago and the most</text>
  <text start="898.7" dur="4.74">interesting part of the discussion was</text>
  <text start="901.13" dur="5.34">the unique challenges faced by the</text>
  <text start="903.44" dur="5.19">Treasury over the medium term especially</text>
  <text start="906.47" dur="4.08">the possibility of significant finance</text>
  <text start="908.63" dur="5.13">and gaps over the next 10 years</text>
  <text start="910.55" dur="4.74">amounting to over 12 trillion and the</text>
  <text start="913.76" dur="4.32">potential need for more domestic</text>
  <text start="915.29" dur="5.9">investor participation if foreign</text>
  <text start="918.08" dur="6.84">reserve growth slows which means that</text>
  <text start="921.19" dur="5.74">many countries are not purchasing</text>
  <text start="924.92" dur="5.94">Treasuries and they&amp;#39;re dumping</text>
  <text start="926.93" dur="6.21">Treasuries so the TBA C is also</text>
  <text start="930.86" dur="4.14">increasingly worried that foreign</text>
  <text start="933.14" dur="4.26">investors already hold significant</text>
  <text start="935" dur="4.35">dollar debt which is why the US will</text>
  <text start="937.4" dur="4.35">have to increasingly rely on domestic</text>
  <text start="939.35" dur="5.94">savings to fund its future budget</text>
  <text start="941.75" dur="6.47">deficit and here the TBA C made a</text>
  <text start="945.29" dur="5.91">surprising I guess tongue-in-cheek</text>
  <text start="948.22" dur="5.86">observation namely that the reserve</text>
  <text start="951.2" dur="6.36">managers have been gradually increasing</text>
  <text start="954.08" dur="5.91">allocation to other currencies and that</text>
  <text start="957.56" dur="5.52">the u.s. d the u.s. dollar</text>
  <text start="959.99" dur="8.76">&amp;#39;sheriff FX reserves has steadily come</text>
  <text start="963.08" dur="7.29">down from 72% in 2000 to 62% now even</text>
  <text start="968.75" dur="4.68">though the US dollar is still the</text>
  <text start="970.37" dur="6.93">dominant reserve currency needless to</text>
  <text start="973.43" dur="7.92">say it seems like they were joking but</text>
  <text start="977.3" dur="7.47">were they really joking because you</text>
  <text start="981.35" dur="6.359">never question the reserve status it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="984.77" dur="4.05">generally frowned upon and people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="987.709" dur="6.181">like to talk about it</text>
  <text start="988.82" dur="6.87">and it you can see throughout time that</text>
  <text start="993.89" dur="5.1">other countries when they were the</text>
  <text start="995.69" dur="7.2">reserve currency well all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="998.99" dur="5.43">one day it just came to an end and it</text>

  <text start="1004.42" dur="5.609">last time just ask any of the countries</text>
  <text start="1007.48" dur="5.91">which have joy the reserve currency</text>
