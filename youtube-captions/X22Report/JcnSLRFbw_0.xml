  <text start="1289.57" dur="5.4">do have a say in it because these are</text>
  <text start="1291.88" dur="7.83">our elected officials they work for us</text>
  <text start="1294.97" dur="8.04">why all of a sudden did his son get</text>
  <text start="1299.71" dur="6.39">involved with a gas company and joined</text>
  <text start="1303.01" dur="7.07">the board of directors in Ukraine at the</text>
  <text start="1306.1" dur="7.49">same exact moment when there was a coup</text>
  <text start="1310.08" dur="6.76">when the United States central bankers</text>
  <text start="1313.59" dur="5.23">implemented the puppet regime when the</text>
  <text start="1316.84" dur="4.53">United States bailed them out with 1</text>
  <text start="1318.82" dur="6.21">billion and the IMF billed them out with</text>
  <text start="1321.37" dur="6.9">17 billion why all of a sudden is he</text>
  <text start="1325.03" dur="6.45">there now and it is our business because</text>
  <text start="1328.27" dur="6.54">these people work for us we do not work</text>
  <text start="1331.48" dur="6.75">for them and he is associated with the</text>
  <text start="1334.81" dur="5.84">vice president so it does become our</text>
  <text start="1338.23" dur="4.579">business at this time</text>
  <text start="1340.65" dur="4.47">okay now we understand that Donetsk had</text>
  <text start="1342.809" dur="4.741">a referendum but it looks like the UN is</text>
  <text start="1345.12" dur="5.64">not going to recognized on ensk a lot of</text>
  <text start="1347.55" dur="6.09">nations do recognize that Donetsk is</text>
  <text start="1350.76" dur="4.68">autonomous at this time but the UN of</text>
  <text start="1353.64" dur="4.71">course you know the UN is kind of</text>
  <text start="1355.44" dur="4.56">controlled by the United States central</text>
  <text start="1358.35" dur="5.87">bankers and they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="1360" dur="7.14">recognize Donetsk at this point now</text>
  <text start="1364.22" dur="5.08">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="1367.14" dur="5.52">Ukrainian authorities have been using</text>
  <text start="1369.3" dur="4.89">helicopters and they had the UN symbol</text>
  <text start="1372.66" dur="4.53">on there now they&amp;#39;ll own these</text>
  <text start="1374.19" dur="5.7">helicopters out to the UN for</text>
  <text start="1377.19" dur="4.32">peacekeeping operations and they place</text>
  <text start="1379.89" dur="4.169">the UN symbols on there and the</text>
  <text start="1381.51" dur="5.52">helicopters were returned to Ukraine but</text>
  <text start="1384.059" dur="4.741">they just so happened to take off they</text>
  <text start="1387.03" dur="4.47">just so happen to forgot to take off the</text>
  <text start="1388.8" dur="5.34">UN logo as they were flying them around</text>
  <text start="1391.5" dur="4.74">in the country and of course Russia is</text>
  <text start="1394.14" dur="4.14">out there saying that you know Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1396.24" dur="3.96">Authority should have removed UN symbols</text>
  <text start="1398.28" dur="3.81">from the helicopters used by the</text>
  <text start="1400.2" dur="4.29">Ukrainian National Guard because it is a</text>
  <text start="1402.09" dur="4.339">little confusing thinking that oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1404.49" dur="5.88">the UN coming in and it really is</text>
  <text start="1406.429" dur="6.851">Ukrainian forces paid mercenaries the</text>
  <text start="1410.37" dur="5.58">the National Guard flying around in UN</text>
  <text start="1413.28" dur="5.46">helicopters now I kind of think they did</text>
  <text start="1415.95" dur="4.95">this on purpose to confuse the situation</text>
  <text start="1418.74" dur="4.71">and to let these people let their guard</text>
  <text start="1420.9" dur="4.08">down and this is why they actually did</text>
  <text start="1423.45" dur="3.3">it right now now there&amp;#39;s a political</text>
  <text start="1424.98" dur="4.199">commentator out there saying that the</text>
  <text start="1426.75" dur="5.22">United States is backing the Hunta in</text>
  <text start="1429.179" dur="5.221">Kiev to implement a global strategy of</text>
  <text start="1431.97" dur="4.62">encircling Russian and I&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="1434.4" dur="3.93">many times the United States central</text>
  <text start="1436.59" dur="5.25">bankers are out there at this time and</text>
  <text start="1438.33" dur="6.63">they are encircling China containing</text>
  <text start="1441.84" dur="5.49">China as President Obama says and making</text>
  <text start="1444.96" dur="5.25">sure when this world war starts they</text>
  <text start="1447.33" dur="5.099">have all bases and everything ready to</text>
  <text start="1450.21" dur="4.8">go we see the same thing happening in</text>
  <text start="1452.429" dur="6.361">Russia they have the missile shield set</text>
  <text start="1455.01" dur="6.57">up NATO and US forces have been moving</text>
  <text start="1458.79" dur="5.16">in troops and military assets and at</text>
  <text start="1461.58" dur="4.97">this time they have been surrounding</text>
  <text start="1463.95" dur="5.19">Russia because they are preparing for</text>
  <text start="1466.55" dur="5.26">war and this is what they do</text>
  <text start="1469.14" dur="4.41">incrementally they continually move in</text>
  <text start="1471.81" dur="2.64">more and more and if you look at the</text>
  <text start="1473.55" dur="2.34">basis</text>
  <text start="1474.45" dur="3.75">surrounding and I mentioned this before</text>
  <text start="1475.89" dur="4.92">in another report where there are many</text>
  <text start="1478.2" dur="5.85">many bases surrounding China and if you</text>
  <text start="1480.81" dur="5.1">look at the Eastern European bases with</text>
  <text start="1484.05" dur="6.54">NATO in the United States all these</text>
  <text start="1485.91" dur="8.73">bases pretty much encircle Russia at</text>
  <text start="1490.59" dur="8.94">this time now Ukraine is agreeing to</text>
  <text start="1494.64" dur="7.47">have talks with the Donetsk people but</text>
  <text start="1499.53" dur="5.31">they don&amp;#39;t want them included so who are</text>
  <text start="1502.11" dur="5.49">they having talks with I guess United</text>
  <text start="1504.84" dur="4.74">States and Russia because the Kiev</text>
  <text start="1507.6" dur="5.91">agrees to hold a dialogue as part of the</text>
  <text start="1509.58" dur="8.58">OSCE plan but it&amp;#39;s but its success</text>
  <text start="1513.51" dur="6.96">remains doubtful as the people who were</text>
  <text start="1518.16" dur="4.38">fighting for their democracy and freedom</text>
  <text start="1520.47" dur="4.41">and to be autonomous from Ukraine are</text>
  <text start="1522.54" dur="4.8">not invited just like the first talks</text>
  <text start="1524.88" dur="6.36">the first talks they were not invited</text>
  <text start="1527.34" dur="6.72">either so how do you have talks without</text>
  <text start="1531.24" dur="5.52">the people being invited it makes no</text>
  <text start="1534.06" dur="5.07">sense because if they invite them then</text>
  <text start="1536.76" dur="4.59">they recognize them if they recognize</text>
  <text start="1539.13" dur="4.59">them the world views them differently if</text>
  <text start="1541.35" dur="4.02">they do if they say oh no they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1543.72" dur="4.35">invited because we don&amp;#39;t recognize them</text>
  <text start="1545.37" dur="5.13">the world says well what&amp;#39;s the purpose</text>
  <text start="1548.07" dur="4.5">of these talks then so really they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1550.5" dur="4.2">not looking for peace right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1552.57" dur="5.46">looking to push their agenda forward and</text>
  <text start="1554.7" dur="6.9">that is to continually try to capture</text>
  <text start="1558.03" dur="5.46">the entire country of Ukraine so at this</text>
  <text start="1561.6" dur="3.45">time as we can see from all the evidence</text>
  <text start="1563.49" dur="3.87">and the actions of the United States</text>
  <text start="1565.05" dur="3.81">central bankers so far they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1567.36" dur="5.93">looking for peace because they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1568.86" dur="8.7">driving this mission all along now</text>
  <text start="1573.29" dur="8.68">Ukraine this is unbelievable Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1577.56" dur="7.53">just issued 1 billion bonds backed by</text>

  <text start="1611.88" dur="7.83">world is this happening and why isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1615.68" dur="6.67">anyone stopping this so we can see at</text>
  <text start="1619.71" dur="4.92">this point that the united states</text>

  <text start="1643.53" dur="6.15">this should never be allowed to happen</text>
  <text start="1646.74" dur="5.76">now of course Ukraine&amp;#39;s bondholders</text>
  <text start="1649.68" dur="6.51">could face losses if the people of</text>

  <text start="1954.74" dur="6.15">when we connect everything it creates a</text>
  <text start="1957.62" dur="6.059">picture and here&amp;#39;s more to this picture</text>
  <text start="1960.89" dur="6.27">because we understand they are going to</text>
  <text start="1963.679" dur="6.421">do something very soon and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1967.16" dur="5.7">seeing right now is Obama imme meets the</text>
