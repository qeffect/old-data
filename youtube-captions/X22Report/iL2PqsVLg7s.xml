  <text start="33.51" dur="4.51">today&amp;#39;s title the episode is the</text>
  <text start="35.89" dur="4.68">economic collapse is starting to heat up</text>
  <text start="38.02" dur="5.039">and we&amp;#39;re seeing this all around the</text>
  <text start="40.57" dur="7.32">world and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of things</text>
  <text start="43.059" dur="9.241">going on and today we see the market the</text>
  <text start="47.89" dur="7.77">asian market is down the european and US</text>
  <text start="52.3" dur="6.419">markets are up gold is rising again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="55.66" dur="6.39">up by $22 or so in the market inched up</text>
  <text start="58.719" dur="6.961">by 89 points it&amp;#39;s above 15,000 points</text>
  <text start="62.05" dur="7.05">right now but when we stop looking at</text>
  <text start="65.68" dur="6.509">the stock market and we look around the</text>
  <text start="69.1" dur="7.14">world and we see what is really going on</text>
  <text start="72.189" dur="9.021">it paints a completely different picture</text>
  <text start="76.24" dur="9.69">and for instance if we go out to Italy</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="9.31">Italy Greece Portugal yes they will</text>
  <text start="85.93" dur="7.71">probably get bailed out with more money</text>
  <text start="90.52" dur="6.98">that is loan to them but every single</text>
  <text start="93.64" dur="8.1">time this happens it results in the same</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="7.329">problem they can&amp;#39;t repay the money they</text>
  <text start="101.74" dur="5.669">received so they need more of it and it</text>
  <text start="104.829" dur="5.07">continually puts them in this cycle that</text>
  <text start="107.409" dur="4.771">they will never get out of until the</text>
  <text start="109.899" dur="5.521">time comes where they just can&amp;#39;t borrow</text>
  <text start="112.18" dur="7.229">any more I mean it&amp;#39;s a very simple thing</text>
  <text start="115.42" dur="5.879">if you take a a person and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="119.409" dur="3.691">living their lives and they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="121.299" dur="3.6">20,000 let&amp;#39;s say they&amp;#39;re making fifty</text>
  <text start="123.1" dur="3.42">thousand dollars and they have a hundred</text>
  <text start="124.899" dur="4.021">and fifty thousand dollars worth of debt</text>
  <text start="126.52" dur="4.2">of credit card debt and they continually</text>
  <text start="128.92" dur="4.89">take out a credit card to cover the</text>
  <text start="130.72" dur="6.27">interest payments on that debt sooner or</text>
  <text start="133.81" dur="5.01">later you can&amp;#39;t take out any more</text>
  <text start="136.99" dur="4.5">the amount of money that you&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="138.82" dur="4.89">in just doesn&amp;#39;t cover it anymore and the</text>
  <text start="141.49" dur="4.08">party ends basically that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="143.71" dur="7.38">going to see we&amp;#39;re definitely going to</text>
  <text start="145.57" dur="7.41">see the party end so here are some 11</text>
  <text start="151.09" dur="5.19">signs that Italy is descending into a</text>

  <text start="178.81" dur="4.62">quarters in a row number five it is</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="4.2">being projected that Italy&amp;#39;s GDP will</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="4.86">shrink by one point eight percent number</text>
  <text start="185.74" dur="5.79">six industrial production in Italy has</text>

  <text start="212.5" dur="5.28">a hundred and thirty percent number 11</text>
  <text start="215.89" dur="6.11">and is being projected illy will need a</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="7.56">major EU bailout within six months so</text>
  <text start="222" dur="6.51">basically yes they can continually bail</text>
  <text start="225.34" dur="6">out all these people and eventually</text>
  <text start="228.51" dur="5.23">they&amp;#39;ll get back you know for a little</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="4.17">while that everything&amp;#39;s fine and then</text>
  <text start="233.74" dur="4.44">all of a sudden the same thing will</text>
  <text start="235.51" dur="5.31">happen just like in greece bailout one</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="4.02">bailout two and then we used up all that</text>
  <text start="240.82" dur="3.36">money we can&amp;#39;t make the interest</text>
  <text start="242.2" dur="4.77">payments we can&amp;#39;t do anything we need</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="5.85">another bailout and we will see this</text>
  <text start="246.97" dur="5.82">over and over and over until the country</text>
  <text start="250.03" dur="4.44">completely says and everyone else says</text>
  <text start="252.79" dur="10.83">we can&amp;#39;t loan you any more money we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.47" dur="12.03">done here and basically in China the US</text>
  <text start="263.62" dur="4.95">and Europe have always suppressed the</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="3.87">rising price of gold and this was on the</text>
  <text start="268.57" dur="3.62">China radio</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="4.89">and the China Radio International</text>
  <text start="272.19" dur="5.289">sponsored newspaper World News Journal</text>

  <text start="288.37" dur="6.59">come in they purchase Russia is doing</text>
  <text start="290.86" dur="6.24">the same exact thing and basically the</text>
  <text start="294.96" dur="4.48">majority of its gold reserves have been</text>
  <text start="297.1" dur="4.62">located in the US and European countries</text>
  <text start="299.44" dur="5.07">the US and Europe have always suppressed</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="4.59">the rising price of gold they intend to</text>
  <text start="304.51" dur="4.17">weaken gold function as an international</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="4.139">reserve currency they don&amp;#39;t want to see</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="5.54">other countries turning to gold reserves</text>
  <text start="310.449" dur="8.101">instead of the u.s. dollar or euro and</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="8.44">basically in was like two episodes or</text>
  <text start="318.55" dur="7.2">one episode ago we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="322.66" dur="6.03">Bundesbank is saying that china is going</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="7.19">to become the next world reserve</text>
  <text start="328.69" dur="7.4">currency they have a huge gold reserve</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="8.05">Russia has huge gold reserves and</text>
  <text start="336.09" dur="9.19">basically the England us and the Western</text>
  <text start="340.99" dur="7.71">nations deal mostly in fiat and they do</text>
  <text start="345.28" dur="5.25">not have huge gold reserves they are</text>
  <text start="348.7" dur="5.13">trying to catch up now with the central</text>
  <text start="350.53" dur="6.21">bank bankers buying up the gold as they</text>
  <text start="353.83" dur="5.28">smack down the price of gold they just</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="4.799">gobble it up just like all of us should</text>
  <text start="359.11" dur="4.589">be doing instead of selling it we should</text>
  <text start="361.539" dur="5.071">be you know basically saying you know</text>
  <text start="363.699" dur="7.891">what this stuff is on sale and we need</text>
  <text start="366.61" dur="8.46">to buy it now Japan the Japanese people</text>
  <text start="371.59" dur="6.66">are also purchasing gold right now in</text>
  <text start="375.07" dur="7.77">Japan gold bullion demand in 2013 is</text>
  <text start="378.25" dur="8.19">twice the level seen in 2012 and I like</text>
  <text start="382.84" dur="5.88">the way this article puts it that gold</text>
  <text start="386.44" dur="4.62">is your insurance policy and you have to</text>
  <text start="388.72" dur="5.55">think of it this way I think how much</text>
  <text start="391.06" dur="8.25">money you throw out on automobile</text>
  <text start="394.27" dur="7.88">insurance homeowners insurance if you</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="2.84">have life insurance</text>
  <text start="402.35" dur="6.73">you spend a couple hundred dollars a</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="5.76">month on insurance which you never get</text>
  <text start="409.08" dur="5.25">back it disappears into the ether for</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="4.92">this ridiculous protection that might</text>
  <text start="414.33" dur="6.51">not happen to you and over the course of</text>
  <text start="416.79" dur="8.7">your life you will spend oodles amount</text>
  <text start="420.84" dur="8.84">of money on this insurance think of gold</text>
  <text start="425.49" dur="8.4">and silver as your insurance policy on</text>
  <text start="429.68" dur="5.739">fiat currency so basically if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.89" dur="3.48">spending I&amp;#39;m just going to make up a</text>
  <text start="435.419" dur="4.081">number here two hundred dollars a month</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="7.17">on auto insurance which you never see</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="8.15">again it&amp;#39;s just gone you are spending</text>
  <text start="444.54" dur="5.4">twenty four hundred dollars a year and</text>
  <text start="447.65" dur="4.12">it&amp;#39;s basically taking money and throwing</text>
  <text start="449.94" dur="2.64">it out the window because they&amp;#39;re you</text>
  <text start="451.77" dur="2.52">know they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="452.58" dur="5.1">protect you you know if you get into a</text>
  <text start="454.29" dur="7.62">car accident gold silver you know</text>
  <text start="457.68" dur="6.96">palladium any type of the Prussian</text>
  <text start="461.91" dur="5.28">precious metals you purchase the</text>
  <text start="464.64" dur="5.58">precious metals that is your insurance</text>
  <text start="467.19" dur="5.55">policy against the collapse of fiat</text>
  <text start="470.22" dur="6.3">currency but the best thing about it</text>
  <text start="472.74" dur="7.62">this insurance policy continually goes</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="6.959">up in value and you hold on to it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.36" dur="6.48">yours you get to keep it if you look at</text>
  <text start="483.479" dur="7.051">a graph from just say from the 1900s now</text>
  <text start="486.84" dur="8.16">yes gold and silver they dip down but</text>
  <text start="490.53" dur="8.1">the trend has always been up it has</text>
  <text start="495" dur="5.49">never gone down down down down yes it</text>
  <text start="498.63" dur="4.349">might have dipped for a year or so or</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="5.7">two years but then the trend always goes</text>
  <text start="502.979" dur="5.161">up and makes up the difference so I like</text>
  <text start="506.19" dur="5.09">the way they put this it is an insurance</text>
  <text start="508.14" dur="6.029">policy and we have been conditioned to</text>
  <text start="511.28" dur="5.68">buy other insurance and we have no</text>
  <text start="514.169" dur="4.891">problem spending the money but when it</text>
  <text start="516.96" dur="3.81">comes to gold and silver people always</text>
  <text start="519.06" dur="2.94">are cautious and like oh you know I</text>
  <text start="520.77" dur="2.85">don&amp;#39;t want to do that but you have no</text>
  <text start="522" dur="3.9">problem throwing money out the window</text>
  <text start="523.62" dur="4.77">for automobile insurance or for</text>
  <text start="525.9" dur="4.17">homeowners or for life insurance or for</text>
  <text start="528.39" dur="6.68">health insurance whatever you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.07" dur="5">spending it on okay let&amp;#39;s move on here</text>
  <text start="535.529" dur="7.211">now last week we got the jobs report and</text>
  <text start="539.16" dur="6.82">the news was going around saying how</text>
  <text start="542.74" dur="5.099">great the job market is the stock market</text>
  <text start="545.98" dur="6.96">you know is going up because of this</text>
  <text start="547.839" dur="6.601">great news and this is 15 signs of the</text>
  <text start="552.94" dur="3.389">quality of jobs in America is going</text>
  <text start="554.44" dur="4.53">downhill I&amp;#39;m not going to read all 15 I</text>
  <text start="556.329" dur="4.981">picked out some of the ones that I</text>
  <text start="558.97" dur="5.64">thought were really good and highlighted</text>
  <text start="561.31" dur="7.769">what is really going on in the in in the</text>
  <text start="564.61" dur="7.289">country and number two in America today</text>
  <text start="569.079" dur="5.401">only 44 seven percent of adults have a</text>
  <text start="571.899" dur="4.68">full-time job number three even though</text>
  <text start="574.48" dur="5.01">even though the US economy created</text>
  <text start="576.579" dur="6.241">nearly 200,000 jobs in June the number</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="6.17">of full-time jobs actually decrease then</text>
  <text start="582.82" dur="6.68">we&amp;#39;ve seen this where the jobs are</text>
  <text start="585.66" dur="7.03">decreasing and they&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="589.5" dur="6.13">flipping over now into part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="592.69" dur="5.339">because as people lose their jobs there</text>
  <text start="595.63" dur="5.01">are high paying full time jobs it is</text>
  <text start="598.029" dur="5.131">very difficult to get that same type of</text>
  <text start="600.64" dur="6.36">job again now you can I&amp;#39;ve had friends</text>
  <text start="603.16" dur="6.21">who lost their job here and they tried</text>
  <text start="607" dur="4.74">for a couple of months to get the same</text>
  <text start="609.37" dur="5.279">type of paying job but they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="611.74" dur="5.49">they had to move away into another part</text>
  <text start="614.649" dur="3.961">of the country to get that same exact</text>
  <text start="617.23" dur="3.87">job they didn&amp;#39;t make any more money</text>
  <text start="618.61" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re just saying even they had to</text>
  <text start="621.1" dur="4.5">sell their house some people how to sell</text>
  <text start="623.14" dur="4.98">at a loss some people broke even and</text>
  <text start="625.6" dur="7.44">some people made a little bit depending</text>
  <text start="628.12" dur="7.11">on when they purchase the home okay one</text>
  <text start="633.04" dur="4.38">out of every ten jobs in the United</text>
  <text start="635.23" dur="4.5">States is now filled through a temp</text>
  <text start="637.42" dur="5.039">agency now that makes sense to me</text>
  <text start="639.73" dur="4.859">because as more of these full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="642.459" dur="4.351">are being replaced by temp by people</text>
  <text start="644.589" dur="3.93">getting one or two or three temp jobs to</text>
  <text start="646.81" dur="4.79">make up the difference they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="648.519" dur="5.781">through temp agencies to get work</text>
  <text start="651.6" dur="4.989">according to one recent survey</text>
  <text start="654.3" dur="4.96">seventy-six percent of all Americans are</text>
  <text start="656.589" dur="6.171">living paycheck to paycheck again if</text>
  <text start="659.26" dur="7.29">you&amp;#39;re went from a full-time job and now</text>
  <text start="662.76" dur="4.99">that job you no longer have and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="666.55" dur="4.38">making less</text>
  <text start="667.75" dur="5.64">and food is going up fuel is going up</text>
  <text start="670.93" dur="5.66">insurance is definitely going up I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="673.39" dur="8.13">know any of you but auto insurance is</text>
  <text start="676.59" dur="7.39">going up quite a bit I notice every</text>
  <text start="681.52" dur="5.85">single time my policy comes up there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="683.98" dur="6.39">always an increase all right let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="687.37" dur="5.46">on here high-paying manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="690.37" dur="3.93">continue to be shipped overseas sadly</text>
  <text start="692.83" dur="3.78">there are fewer Americans employed a</text>
  <text start="694.3" dur="3.54">manufacturer now more than there was in</text>
  <text start="696.61" dur="3.06">nineteen fifty even though the</text>
  <text start="697.84" dur="4.17">population of the country has more than</text>
  <text start="699.67" dur="4.71">doubled since then well basically all</text>
  <text start="702.01" dur="5.19">the manufacturing jobs have been moved</text>
  <text start="704.38" dur="5.04">off into other countries in the United</text>
  <text start="707.2" dur="4.71">States we have very few manufacturing</text>
  <text start="709.42" dur="5.04">jobs and most of the companies have</text>
  <text start="711.91" dur="4.44">moved off into different countries</text>
  <text start="714.46" dur="4.22">because the labors cheaper taxes are</text>
  <text start="716.35" dur="5.31">cheaper everything is cheaper over there</text>
  <text start="718.68" dur="5.14">at this point an astounding fifty three</text>
  <text start="721.66" dur="4.94">percent of all american workers make</text>
  <text start="723.82" dur="5.34">less than thirty thousand a year and</text>
  <text start="726.6" dur="5.23">making less than thirty thousand year is</text>

  <text start="892.48" dur="4.05">thought was a very interesting things</text>
  <text start="893.68" dur="6.18">are pushing to repeal credit union</text>
  <text start="896.53" dur="6.48">federal tax exemptions and the way I see</text>
  <text start="899.86" dur="6">this is that the banks the Fed the</text>
  <text start="903.01" dur="6.63">government they&amp;#39;re all looking for ways</text>
  <text start="905.86" dur="8.13">to create new taxes and to get more</text>
  <text start="909.64" dur="7.74">money into the government to cover the</text>
  <text start="913.99" dur="5.91">shortfall of all these jobs that are</text>
  <text start="917.38" dur="7.29">being lost and the tax revenue coming in</text>
  <text start="919.9" dur="9">to pay the interest on the national debt</text>
  <text start="924.67" dur="8.7">and basically credit unions are exempt</text>
  <text start="928.9" dur="6.95">from paying tax and basically the</text>
  <text start="933.37" dur="9.93">exemption costs about 1.6 billion</text>
  <text start="935.85" dur="9.67">per year and the major banks are very</text>
  <text start="943.3" dur="3.81">upset about this and the government is</text>
  <text start="945.52" dur="4.44">probably looking at this going ho this</text>
  <text start="947.11" dur="7.919">is a whole brand new tax revenue that we</text>
  <text start="949.96" dur="7.379">can bring in plus banks are losing their</text>
  <text start="955.029" dur="4.171">I&amp;#39;m not even call them depositors</text>
  <text start="957.339" dur="5.19">anymore I&amp;#39;m gonna call them creditors</text>
  <text start="959.2" dur="6.449">they&amp;#39;re losing their creditors to credit</text>
  <text start="962.529" dur="5.641">unions because people are fed up with</text>
  <text start="965.649" dur="4.711">the major banks and the banks are losing</text>
  <text start="968.17" dur="4.35">money and they don&amp;#39;t want to lose money</text>
  <text start="970.36" dur="4.65">they want people coming back and</text>
  <text start="972.52" dur="5.069">depositing their money into the banks</text>
  <text start="975.01" dur="5.79">and this is why I see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="977.589" dur="6.69">making a big stink because especially</text>
  <text start="980.8" dur="6.72">when the balance hit guess what if more</text>
  <text start="984.279" dur="7.951">depositors or creditors they have the</text>
  <text start="987.52" dur="8.31">more they can take from you now it looks</text>
  <text start="992.23" dur="5.51">like Israel attack Syria weapon depot</text>

  <text start="1033.42" dur="7.83">airplane that was flying only in their</text>

  <text start="1041.25" dur="8.88">third attack inside Syria since January</text>
  <text start="1045.9" dur="7.83">and we know the Syrian forces are not</text>

  <text start="1053.73" dur="5.49">from the United States government</text>

  <text start="1079.09" dur="7.7">get into Syria will lead them into Iran</text>
  <text start="1082.57" dur="7.86">because Iran has a pact with Syria and</text>
  <text start="1086.79" dur="5.11">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a direct line to invade Iran</text>
  <text start="1090.43" dur="3.96">at this point because Iran is going to</text>
  <text start="1091.9" dur="5.9">come to Syria&amp;#39;s rescue but there is a</text>
  <text start="1094.39" dur="8.85">problem Russia is and China are backing</text>
  <text start="1097.8" dur="9.76">Syria and Iran and basically Putin knows</text>
  <text start="1103.24" dur="6.21">what&amp;#39;s going on and he&amp;#39;s urging the</text>
  <text start="1107.56" dur="5.16">Syrian opposition leadership to</text>

  <text start="1173.89" dur="9.78">let&amp;#39;s talk about this and basically the</text>
  <text start="1180.16" dur="8.07">Syrian opposition is sticking to their</text>
  <text start="1183.67" dur="6.39">demands they want weapons and basically</text>
  <text start="1188.23" dur="8.22">they don&amp;#39;t have time for peace right now</text>
  <text start="1190.06" dur="9.15">and basically the the one of the rebels</text>
  <text start="1196.45" dur="4.5">Syrian leaders I will not read said I</text>
  <text start="1199.21" dur="3.63">will not rest until i procure the</text>
  <text start="1200.95" dur="4.2">advanced weapons needed to hit back</text>
  <text start="1202.84" dur="4.71">at Assad and his allies I give myself</text>
  <text start="1205.15" dur="5.49">one month to achieve what I am intent on</text>
  <text start="1207.55" dur="7.89">doing and basically they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1210.64" dur="6.72">about p state their whole goal is to</text>
  <text start="1215.44" dur="4.53">overthrow the government backed by the</text>
  <text start="1217.36" dur="6.41">United States government that is their</text>
  <text start="1219.97" dur="7.83">intention that is what they&amp;#39;re doing now</text>
  <text start="1223.77" dur="7.57">also Putin says Egypt now is moving</text>
  <text start="1227.8" dur="6.06">towards a civil war and basically the</text>
  <text start="1231.34" dur="5.19">Russian president is warning that he</text>
  <text start="1233.86" dur="5.01">sees this coming and I can see why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1236.53" dur="3.96">saying this because basically Morsi was</text>
  <text start="1238.87" dur="6.87">backed by the United States government</text>
  <text start="1240.49" dur="9.12">he was paid in aid billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="1245.74" dur="6.33">to Egypt to keep the reserve currency in</text>
  <text start="1249.61" dur="5.55">check to keep the central bank in check</text>
  <text start="1252.07" dur="6.18">and basically he kind of screwed up he</text>
  <text start="1255.16" dur="6.06">backed the rebels in Syria the people</text>
  <text start="1258.25" dur="5.46">you know didn&amp;#39;t like this the people</text>
  <text start="1261.22" dur="4.92">rose up and they said we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1263.71" dur="5.67">Morsi there anymore we want him I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1266.14" dur="6.42">stood and we want our own leader that</text>
  <text start="1269.38" dur="7.85">has no ties that receives no aid that is</text>
  <text start="1272.56" dur="7.86">not paid off by the US government and</text>
  <text start="1277.23" dur="7.57">basically it looks like the government</text>
  <text start="1280.42" dur="6.33">the US government is creating havoc in</text>
  <text start="1284.8" dur="4.71">this region because they are very</text>
  <text start="1286.75" dur="6.99">nervous because they need to make sure</text>
  <text start="1289.51" dur="6.18">that the next person in power they can</text>
  <text start="1293.74" dur="5.42">control because they do not want the</text>
  <text start="1295.69" dur="6.27">reserve currency of that country to</text>
  <text start="1299.16" dur="8.29">basically be removed and they want the</text>
  <text start="1301.96" dur="10.74">central bank to be kept there and the</text>
  <text start="1307.45" dur="7.62">people don&amp;#39;t want America involved or</text>
  <text start="1312.7" dur="6.45">the Obama and Obama administration</text>
  <text start="1315.07" dur="6.33">involved at all and basically the US</text>
  <text start="1319.15" dur="6.15">government cannot let this happen and</text>
  <text start="1321.4" dur="6.38">this is why we might see the exact</text>
  <text start="1325.3" dur="9.32">duplicate of what&amp;#39;s happening in Syria</text>
  <text start="1327.78" dur="7.99">we will see paid mercenaries fighting</text>
  <text start="1334.62" dur="4.24">again</text>
  <text start="1335.77" dur="7.4">whatever government or is there saying</text>
  <text start="1338.86" dur="6.87">that we they want to overthrow but it</text>
  <text start="1343.17" dur="4.63">you can see this how this is going to</text>
  <text start="1345.73" dur="4.77">turn out the same things happening in</text>
  <text start="1347.8" dur="7.11">Syria right now these are not true civil</text>
  <text start="1350.5" dur="9.69">wars these are not true you know battles</text>

  <text start="1363.7" dur="7.5">the central banks now I thought it was</text>
  <text start="1369.61" dur="4.2">interesting that Kokesh was in</text>

  <text start="2445.3" dur="3.96">United States in the Bank of England</text>
  <text start="2446.44" dur="5.94">have their document that they created in</text>
  <text start="2449.26" dur="4.98">at 2012 and I have that in the documents</text>
  <text start="2452.38" dur="3.69">section if you go to resources documents</text>
  <text start="2454.24" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;m still working on that I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2456.07" dur="3.48">gotten back to it but I will be updating</text>
  <text start="2457.9" dur="3.99">that with more documents and putting</text>
  <text start="2459.55" dur="9.809">explanations for all the documents and I</text>
  <text start="2461.89" dur="10.229">will get to that now if we look at why</text>
  <text start="2469.359" dur="5.22">your money will probably not be safe</text>
  <text start="2472.119" dur="4.591">let&amp;#39;s just look at Cypress they told us</text>
  <text start="2474.579" dur="3.691">that capital controls will be in effect</text>
  <text start="2476.71" dur="4.28">for two weeks and they said well more</text>
  <text start="2478.27" dur="5.45">week now we&amp;#39;re over a hundred days they</text>
  <text start="2480.99" dur="5.05">took the top part of their money a</text>
  <text start="2483.72" dur="4.33">percentage and they took that money away</text>
  <text start="2486.04" dur="4.01">then the second part of the percentage</text>
  <text start="2488.05" dur="4.769">of their account they traded it in for</text>
  <text start="2490.05" dur="4.569">crappy bank stock which the bank is</text>
  <text start="2492.819" dur="4.491">defaulting so you got the folding bank</text>
  <text start="2494.619" dur="5.521">stock which makes sense and then we had</text>
  <text start="2497.31" dur="4.42">the rest of the money frozen where you</text>
  <text start="2500.14" dur="3.06">are now allowed to touch it you&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="2501.73" dur="5.49">allowed to take out a certain amount of</text>
  <text start="2503.2" dur="7.5">money each day now in many of the</text>
  <text start="2507.22" dur="8.129">countries in Europe and the UK and in</text>
  <text start="2510.7" dur="7.5">America we do have insurance for money</text>
  <text start="2515.349" dur="7.111">that is deposited for under here in the</text>
  <text start="2518.2" dur="10.02">estate&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s 250,000 the only problem</text>
  <text start="2522.46" dur="8.82">is is that the insurance is good for</text>
  <text start="2528.22" dur="6.869">money if we have like one bank or two</text>
  <text start="2531.28" dur="4.89">banks fail what happens if we have a</text>
  <text start="2535.089" dur="5.52">collapse</text>
  <text start="2536.17" dur="7.47">of all the major banks there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2540.609" dur="7.71">only roughly around 4 billion dollars in</text>
  <text start="2543.64" dur="8.219">the fund of FDIC and there&amp;#39;s about six</text>
  <text start="2548.319" dur="7.621">and a half trillion of event of insured</text>
  <text start="2551.859" dur="7.831">deposits what this means is for every</text>
  <text start="2555.94" dur="7.859">10,000 in deposits it&amp;#39;s protected by</text>
  <text start="2559.69" dur="6.27">only six dollars in reserves and further</text>
  <text start="2563.799" dur="5.52">the FBI&amp;#39;s fund could borrow from the</text>
  <text start="2565.96" dur="6.45">Treasury but the dodd-frank act now</text>
  <text start="2569.319" dur="6.331">bands taxpayer bailouts of most</text>
  <text start="2572.41" dur="7.05">speculative derivatives activities and</text>
  <text start="2575.65" dur="9.919">these would be likely triggered of a</text>
  <text start="2579.46" dur="9.089">2008 style collapse so the basically</text>
  <text start="2585.569" dur="5.411">your money in the bank even though it</text>
  <text start="2588.549" dur="4.981">says insured there won&amp;#39;t even be enough</text>
  <text start="2590.98" dur="6.93">to cover this and there are other</text>
  <text start="2593.53" dur="7.11">problems with covering this type of</text>
  <text start="2597.91" dur="4.409">money and we&amp;#39;ve said this and I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="2600.64" dur="4.11">this before and many other people have</text>
  <text start="2602.319" dur="4.921">said this before if you haven&amp;#39;t started</text>
  <text start="2604.75" dur="4.859">taking money out of the bank I would</text>
  <text start="2607.24" dur="4.349">start doing so because you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="2609.609" dur="4.141">wake up the next morning like the people</text>
  <text start="2611.589" dur="4.441">in Cyprus and I hate to say this but</text>
  <text start="2613.75" dur="5">most of the people in Cyprus who had</text>
  <text start="2616.03" dur="5.49">businesses have lost their businesses</text>
  <text start="2618.75" dur="6.25">who are now living on the streets or</text>
  <text start="2621.52" dur="6.27">saved all of their lives and their money</text>
  <text start="2625" dur="5.52">is just frozen in these banks and they</text>
  <text start="2627.79" dur="5.67">can&amp;#39;t get to it the reason why they kept</text>
  <text start="2630.52" dur="6.87">capital controls in effect is because</text>
  <text start="2633.46" dur="6.42">they don&amp;#39;t want bank runs the news the</text>
  <text start="2637.39" dur="5.969">mainstream media if you notice kind of</text>
  <text start="2639.88" dur="5.04">you know just forgot about it you know</text>
  <text start="2643.359" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re just telling everyone Cyprus is</text>
  <text start="2644.92" dur="7.11">good to go and everything is ok but we</text>
  <text start="2647.319" dur="8.49">know for a fact it is not people still</text>
  <text start="2652.03" dur="5.88">have their money frozen so for those</text>
  <text start="2655.809" dur="4.951">people who haven&amp;#39;t taken their money out</text>
  <text start="2657.91" dur="8.449">I personally would and this is my</text>
  <text start="2660.76" dur="5.599">opinion I would do it just to be safe</text>
  <text start="2666.92" dur="4.08">now I just wanted to go back for a</text>
  <text start="2669.23" dur="4.41">second for those people but I mean I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2671" dur="4.95">been getting questions about how can I</text>
  <text start="2673.64" dur="5.969">protect myself with the spying and</text>
  <text start="2675.95" dur="6.659">things like that I can tell you what i</text>
  <text start="2679.609" dur="6.661">do i use two different browsers i use i</text>
  <text start="2682.609" dur="7.381">don&amp;#39;t use internet explorer I you either</text>
  <text start="2686.27" dur="8.339">use firefox or I use chrome and I use</text>
  <text start="2689.99" dur="7.95">extensions or add-ons that you can add</text>
  <text start="2694.609" dur="8.881">on through the settings function of the</text>
  <text start="2697.94" dur="9.26">browser and it allows you to install a</text>
  <text start="2703.49" dur="8.67">proxy server which will allow you to</text>
  <text start="2707.2" dur="9.55">surf the web from another location so</text>
  <text start="2712.16" dur="8.13">it&amp;#39;s not your location so basically what</text>
  <text start="2716.75" dur="5.7">happens is when you install this proxy</text>
  <text start="2720.29" dur="5.16">server it might show you that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2722.45" dur="5.909">browsing the web from Africa or from</text>
  <text start="2725.45" dur="5.94">another state in the US or from Mexico</text>
  <text start="2728.359" dur="6.75">if you don&amp;#39;t want to use that you can</text>
  <text start="2731.39" dur="8.57">also use start page which is start page</text>
  <text start="2735.109" dur="7.771">com that will mask your searches</text>
  <text start="2739.96" dur="6.73">basically what happens with that it goes</text>
  <text start="2742.88" dur="9.08">out to Google but it does it through its</text>
  <text start="2746.69" dur="8.01">own proxy servers so it doesn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2751.96" dur="5.619">where the searches are coming from and</text>
  <text start="2754.7" dur="6">even if you click over to the site you</text>
  <text start="2757.579" dur="5.76">can use it in stealth mode through a</text>
  <text start="2760.7" dur="4.98">proxy server so it doesn&amp;#39;t even show you</text>
  <text start="2763.339" dur="5.49">going to that site so there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="2765.68" dur="5.55">different methods that you can use some</text>
  <text start="2768.829" dur="4.77">of the better proxies you might have to</text>
  <text start="2771.23" dur="5.879">purchase but there are free ones out</text>
  <text start="2773.599" dur="10.591">there and you can use them with the</text>
  <text start="2777.109" dur="9.541">proxy service listen everyone I want to</text>
  <text start="2784.19" dur="4.379">thank you very much very much I&amp;#39;ll</text>
