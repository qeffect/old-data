  <text start="117.18" dur="9.09">happening and why it is happening when</text>
  <text start="122.4" dur="6.6">we look at the UK for instance the</text>
  <text start="126.27" dur="4.23">people have voted for a brexit the</text>
  <text start="129" dur="4.409">people said listen we don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="5.73">part of the EU government please listen</text>
  <text start="133.409" dur="6.531">to us and give us the brexit it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="6.899">three years now and they&amp;#39;ve gone through</text>
  <text start="139.94" dur="5.799">Theresa May she tried to bring up the</text>
  <text start="143.129" dur="6.06">vote three times then we moved on to</text>
  <text start="145.739" dur="5.61">Boris Johnson he said we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="149.189" dur="5.16">have a brexit by October 31st</text>
  <text start="151.349" dur="5.161">he created a deal that is very very</text>
  <text start="154.349" dur="6.271">similar to Theresa May but within the</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="5.47">deal that&amp;#39;s where it is completely</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="7.27">different</text>
  <text start="161.98" dur="8.399">and Boris Johnson is using this deal</text>
  <text start="167.89" dur="7.26">because this is what the EU wanted he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="170.379" dur="8.58">using this to force the brexit he wants</text>
  <text start="175.15" dur="6.21">the EU to agree he&amp;#39;s showing them hey</text>
  <text start="178.959" dur="6.691">listen this is what you wanted except</text>
  <text start="181.36" dur="7.26">for what Trump and Boris Johnson have</text>
  <text start="185.65" dur="5.58">decided to do here and Trump and Boris</text>
  <text start="188.62" dur="6.449">Johnson I&amp;#39;m gonna use this later on to</text>
  <text start="191.23" dur="7.71">trap the EU this is everything that you</text>
  <text start="195.069" dur="6.75">wanted so vote for it and we can see</text>
  <text start="198.94" dur="5.46">there is pushback and you can see that</text>
  <text start="201.819" dur="6.26">there are certain individuals that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="204.4" dur="7.199">want this to happen no matter what and</text>
  <text start="208.079" dur="6.581">we&amp;#39;re coming down to the wire here now</text>
  <text start="211.599" dur="5.371">if they don&amp;#39;t vote for this we might be</text>
  <text start="214.66" dur="6.449">headed right for a No Deal brexit if</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="5.76">they do vote for this well the EU is</text>
  <text start="221.109" dur="3.63">going to be in trouble no matter which</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="4.619">way you look at this it looks like what</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ve done here is they trapped the EU</text>
  <text start="227.349" dur="3.661">now of course the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="229.419" dur="6.15">everyone else does making it seem like</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="7.62">ooh this is a great deal for the EU this</text>
  <text start="235.569" dur="6.301">is exactly what they wanted and Boris</text>
  <text start="238.63" dur="6.389">Johnson is not delivering I think the</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="5.549">opposite is happening I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="245.019" dur="5.94">starting to realize what he&amp;#39;s done here</text>
  <text start="247.419" dur="4.35">and he&amp;#39;s trapped them into a no-win</text>
  <text start="250.959" dur="2.791">situation</text>
  <text start="251.769" dur="4.111">and again they&amp;#39;re gonna try and do</text>
  <text start="253.75" dur="5.76">whatever they possibly can to get out of</text>
  <text start="255.88" dur="6.509">this but once this happens this is going</text>
  <text start="259.51" dur="5.04">to spread to other countries this is</text>
  <text start="262.389" dur="5.431">what the central banks are most afraid</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="6.239">of now we know here in the United States</text>
  <text start="267.82" dur="5.04">and around the world the economic system</text>
  <text start="270.789" dur="3.69">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the central bank</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="4.17">economic system and everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="274.479" dur="4.381">understand there is a difference between</text>
  <text start="277.03" dur="5.04">what Trump and the Patriots are building</text>
  <text start="278.86" dur="6.3">what Boris Johnson is building those are</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="6.779">going to be people run economies what we</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="8.36">have now since 1913 since 1945 since</text>
  <text start="288.849" dur="7.771">1971 is a central bank system</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="8.17">we are in a central bank system which is</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="9.48">a Fiat system which is run on debt that</text>
  <text start="301.69" dur="7.11">is what is collapsing now and Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.1" dur="5.4">driving it to the extreme he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="308.8" dur="6.78">care what happens to it he&amp;#39;s using all</text>
  <text start="311.5" dur="7.47">the weapons against them and as the</text>
  <text start="315.58" dur="7.56">central bank system implodes it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="318.97" dur="5.58">to take its toll on a lot of these banks</text>
  <text start="323.14" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re already seeing it with Deutsche</text>
  <text start="324.55" dur="7.17">Bank we know they have a large exposure</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="4.35">to the derivative market and Deutsche</text>
  <text start="331.72" dur="5.37">Bank right now they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="333.13" dur="5.46">laying off a huge amount of people most</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="5.64">likely we&amp;#39;re gonna see this with other</text>
  <text start="338.59" dur="6.72">banking systems because remember the</text>
  <text start="342.73" dur="4.23">central bank system is falling apart</text>
  <text start="345.31" dur="4.44">everything that they created and</text>
  <text start="346.96" dur="4.2">designed and pushed debt to all the</text>
  <text start="349.75" dur="2.79">different countries and pushed debt</text>
  <text start="351.16" dur="3.93">around the world</text>
  <text start="352.54" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s having the problem Trump</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="5.91">of the Patriots and soon Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="357.01" dur="6.99">they&amp;#39;re undoing everything the central</text>
  <text start="361" dur="5.1">bank has done this is why the central</text>
  <text start="364" dur="4.53">bank major media the deep state this is</text>
  <text start="366.1" dur="5.28">why they&amp;#39;re so upset this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="368.53" dur="6.39">continually pushing for a recession they</text>
  <text start="371.38" dur="6.72">haven&amp;#39;t stopped that they would rather</text>
  <text start="374.92" dur="6.18">have a recession in this country than</text>
  <text start="378.1" dur="6.03">have Trump undo everything that they</text>
  <text start="381.1" dur="5.97">have done they&amp;#39;d rather destroy people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="384.13" dur="5.79">lives and make people go bankrupt lose</text>
  <text start="387.07" dur="7.83">their homes and whatnot they&amp;#39;d rather</text>
  <text start="389.92" dur="7.37">have that then Trump redo the trade</text>

  <text start="618.839" dur="5.521">they understand how this works</text>
  <text start="621.889" dur="5.23">think think about it when we go back to</text>
  <text start="624.36" dur="5">the Obama administration period of time</text>
  <text start="627.119" dur="5.541">when we came out of the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="629.36" dur="5.439">back then when they were pushing</text>
  <text start="632.66" dur="5.56">stimulus when they were lowering the</text>
  <text start="634.799" dur="6.811">rates they told us that this is what a</text>
  <text start="638.22" dur="6.63">recovery looks like this is what happens</text>
  <text start="641.61" dur="6.059">and it&amp;#39;s okay that the central bank does</text>
  <text start="644.85" dur="4.529">this and what what did we see as they</text>
  <text start="647.669" dur="4.14">lowered rates and as they push stimulus</text>
  <text start="649.379" dur="6.45">many many times not just once three</text>
  <text start="651.809" dur="5.75">three and a half stealth stimulus what</text>

  <text start="657.559" dur="5.83">we saw everything and this is of course</text>
  <text start="661.259" dur="4.82">the statistical numbers look a lot</text>
  <text start="663.389" dur="5.94">better and they told us this is what a</text>
  <text start="666.079" dur="5.05">recovery looks like now Trump wants to</text>
  <text start="669.329" dur="3.69">lower rates and start stimulus they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="671.129" dur="4.8">telling us that that will crash the</text>

  <text start="675.929" dur="5.31">economy what crashes the economy is when</text>
  <text start="679.139" dur="4.2">the central bank raises the rates they</text>
  <text start="681.239" dur="4.89">hit a tipping point and then they drop</text>
  <text start="683.339" dur="4.8">the rates and then all of a sudden a</text>
  <text start="686.129" dur="5.04">couple months later we head into a</text>
  <text start="688.139" dur="5.341">recession because they tipped the</text>
  <text start="691.169" dur="3.061">economy over the edge it&amp;#39;s a domino</text>
  <text start="693.48" dur="4.32">effect</text>
  <text start="694.23" dur="6.96">and when the avalanche starts and that</text>
  <text start="697.8" dur="5.79">whole mound of snow coming down the hill</text>
  <text start="701.19" dur="4.08">gets larger and larger and larger you</text>
