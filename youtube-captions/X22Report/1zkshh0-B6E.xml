  <text start="51.69" dur="6.57">x-22 report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="54" dur="7.34">episode 1260 a and today&amp;#39;s date is April</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="5.43">21st 2017 and the top of the episode is</text>
  <text start="61.34" dur="5.44">billionaires are now terrified of a</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="5.28">major correction this summer let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="66.78" dur="5.31">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="68.97" dur="5.13">news now we can see this is Friday and</text>
  <text start="72.09" dur="4.83">normally what they try to do with the</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="5.28">market is they try to have a happy</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="4.35">ending to the week and it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="3.239">seem like that it&amp;#39;s getting more and</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="2.58">more difficult to do this with the</text>
  <text start="82.619" dur="2.971">market we know the stock market is</text>
  <text start="83.85" dur="3.75">completely manipulated has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="85.59" dur="4.529">with earnings it has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="87.6" dur="4.14">how corporations are doing it has to do</text>
  <text start="90.119" dur="3.631">with the free money that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="91.74" dur="3.81">pumping into the market because there</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="3.57">are many many individuals out there</text>
  <text start="95.55" dur="4.74">saying that the market doesn&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="5.549">sense anymore but we can see after three</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="5.579">days of slamming down gold they had a</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="5.821">very tough time bringing gold down and</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="5.851">we can see today that gold is holding</text>
  <text start="108.69" dur="5.76">steady right now and this is very</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="4.74">interesting because in the past they</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="3.81">used to throw thousands upon thousands</text>
  <text start="116.46" dur="4.53">of contracts that gold and gold would</text>
  <text start="118.26" dur="5.76">come right down but it seems like this</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="4.5">is not the case anymore I mean does it</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="2.97">mean it&amp;#39;s not going to happen no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="125.49" dur="4.529">going to have to see as time goes on</text>
  <text start="126.99" dur="6.33">because like I said if we go into May</text>
  <text start="130.019" dur="6.151">into June into July and they try to slam</text>
  <text start="133.32" dur="8.639">gold down again and it doesn&amp;#39;t move and</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="8.58">it increases by say 20 30 40 50 dollars</text>
  <text start="141.959" dur="6.571">we know right there and then that is a</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="6.15">sign that they cannot bring gold down</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="4.11">anymore they&amp;#39;re losing control and this</text>
  <text start="150.9" dur="3.36">is something that we need to watch now</text>
  <text start="152.64" dur="3.24">there are other people out there and</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re saying no gold is going to be</text>
  <text start="155.88" dur="6.18">going back down to 1150 $1000 but after</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="4.32">these three slam downs one right after</text>
  <text start="162.06" dur="2.82">another during this week you would think</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="3.99">they would have hit that number already</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="3.96">and that just didn&amp;#39;t happen so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="3.42">gonna have to watch that very very</text>
  <text start="168.84" dur="4.679">carefully because we can see that</text>
  <text start="170.82" dur="6.6">anything can happen right now because we</text>
  <text start="173.519" dur="5.491">are in a period of complete chaos but we</text>
  <text start="177.42" dur="4.86">can see the economy is still breaking</text>

  <text start="184.53" dur="4.5">the first three months of 2017 and</text>
  <text start="186.84" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re expecting the next month well</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s not going to get any better</text>
  <text start="190.86" dur="6.42">whatsoever now this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="193.08" dur="5.489">quarterly fall since 2010 and we know</text>
  <text start="197.28" dur="3.87">what happened during that period we were</text>
  <text start="198.569" dur="5.491">in a recession the Great Recession out</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="5.58">in Spain things do not look good for the</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="5.28">people there now we know the stock</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="5.25">market is doing very well it&amp;#39;s staying</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="5.58">up we know the stock market in Europe is</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="6.27">doing very well but the economies of</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="6.53">these countries they have been declining</text>
  <text start="218.25" dur="5.91">for a very long time euro activereports</text>
  <text start="221.45" dur="4.6">the proportion of children living below</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="4.409">the party poverty line in Spain has</text>
  <text start="226.05" dur="6.659">increased by 9 percentage points between</text>
  <text start="228.569" dur="9.5">2008 and 2014 to reach almost 40 percent</text>
  <text start="232.709" dur="8.491">already and Spain has the --use third</text>
  <text start="238.069" dur="6.161">highest rate of child poverty after</text>
  <text start="241.2" dur="5.19">Romania and Greece and as child poverty</text>
  <text start="244.23" dur="5.22">continually rises we can see the</text>
  <text start="246.39" dur="5.129">sharpest increase which is about 56% was</text>
  <text start="249.45" dur="4.55">among households of four people two</text>

  <text start="267.39" dur="5.13">people over 65 Spanish poverty rates</text>
  <text start="270.539" dur="4.38">across the whole nation remain very</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="5.31">extreme right now so things are not</text>
  <text start="274.919" dur="3.901">improving out in Europe actually we can</text>
  <text start="277.83" dur="3.03">see that things are actually</text>
  <text start="278.82" dur="3.48">deteriorating out in Europe and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.86" dur="3.809">getting worse and worse for the people</text>
  <text start="282.3" dur="4.05">here in the United States while we see</text>
  <text start="284.669" dur="4.741">the economy is completely breaking down</text>
  <text start="286.35" dur="4.89">now we get a report that existing home</text>
  <text start="289.41" dur="4.59">sales they have soared to 10-year highs</text>
  <text start="291.24" dur="4.62">and they dropped in February down to 3.9</text>
  <text start="294" dur="3.15">percent and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="295.86" dur="2.34">that mortgage rates have ticked up a</text>
  <text start="297.15" dur="3.329">little bit and they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="298.2" dur="4.08">existing home sales well they have</text>
  <text start="300.479" dur="3.961">increased by four point four percent but</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="4.41">when we look at this very closely we see</text>
  <text start="304.44" dur="4.47">that these are in the hot cities and</text>
  <text start="306.69" dur="5.28">what I say hot cities I mean these are</text>
  <text start="308.91" dur="5.67">the bubble cities the bubble areas where</text>
  <text start="311.97" dur="4.169">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing the bubbles higher</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="3.299">and higher and</text>
  <text start="316.139" dur="3.99">is where hedge fund investment companies</text>
  <text start="317.879" dur="5.25">foreign investors speculators are all in</text>
  <text start="320.129" dur="6.12">these areas pushing real estate up and</text>
  <text start="323.129" dur="4.65">buying homes now remember people are</text>
  <text start="326.249" dur="3.901">writing and saying well I don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="327.779" dur="4.2">anything in my town it looks like things</text>
  <text start="330.15" dur="3.269">are going really well with real estate</text>
  <text start="331.979" dur="3.361">and then other people are writing and</text>
  <text start="333.419" dur="3.87">saying well it is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="4.789">where I live right now real estate is</text>
  <text start="337.289" dur="7.59">dropping drop jobs are very hard to find</text>
  <text start="340.129" dur="7.6">this is what happened during 2007-2008</text>
  <text start="344.879" dur="5.701">and I&amp;#39;ve said this before back during</text>
  <text start="347.729" dur="5.49">that time period up in the state of New</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="5.28">York well we saw a real estate start to</text>
  <text start="353.219" dur="4.32">drop off and when we spoke to other</text>
  <text start="355.86" dur="4.169">individuals like in Florida and other</text>
  <text start="357.539" dur="4.62">areas they didn&amp;#39;t really see anything</text>
  <text start="360.029" dur="5.61">actually things were still booming and</text>
  <text start="362.159" dur="6.301">what happened was as time went on six or</text>
  <text start="365.639" dur="4.261">eight months later all of a sudden those</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="3.359">areas were hit and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="369.9" dur="5.16">interesting about this those areas that</text>
  <text start="371.819" dur="6.66">were last to get hit were the areas that</text>
  <text start="375.06" dur="5.31">got hit the hardest and this is what</text>
  <text start="378.479" dur="4.201">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we&amp;#39;re seeing many</text>
  <text start="380.37" dur="4.319">different areas in the country where all</text>
  <text start="382.68" dur="4.109">of a sudden things have just completely</text>
  <text start="384.689" dur="3.811">dropped off a cliff and other areas</text>
  <text start="386.789" dur="4.111">where they&amp;#39;re in there like you know</text>
  <text start="388.5" dur="5.58">Arizona where they&amp;#39;re out in San</text>
  <text start="390.9" dur="5.129">Francisco in Texas Miami they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="4.049">trying to keep these bubbles up and</text>
  <text start="396.029" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re still trying to pump them up but</text>
  <text start="398.129" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re seeing breaks in the bubble like</text>
  <text start="399.479" dur="5.16">in Miami out in New York area in San</text>
  <text start="402.659" dur="3.78">Francisco and some areas are still</text>
  <text start="404.639" dur="4.02">holding but eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="406.439" dur="5.1">happen it&amp;#39;s going to hit all different</text>
  <text start="408.659" dur="5.341">areas at the same time and when things</text>
  <text start="411.539" dur="3.09">come down is going to be absolutely</text>
  <text start="414" dur="4.61">awful</text>
  <text start="414.629" dur="6.51">just think about what happened back in</text>
  <text start="418.61" dur="4.809">2007-2008 when you saw those pictures of</text>
  <text start="421.139" dur="4.14">those individuals in California just</text>
  <text start="423.419" dur="2.99">leaving their houses and people are</text>
  <text start="425.279" dur="3.63">scratching their head going wow</text>
  <text start="426.409" dur="4.48">California really has it bad they have</text>
  <text start="428.909" dur="3.54">all these rows of homes people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="430.889" dur="2.941">living on it living in their homes</text>
  <text start="432.449" dur="3.481">anymore they just left their furniture</text>
  <text start="433.83" dur="4.079">they left everything in there thank God</text>
  <text start="435.93" dur="4.65">it didn&amp;#39;t hit my area yet and then all</text>
  <text start="437.909" dur="6.391">of a sudden it did hit your area later</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="5.79">on now we see the markets PMI survey for</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="5.28">manufacturing and services well that</text>
  <text start="446.37" dur="5.039">plunge back below pre-election lows</text>
  <text start="449.58" dur="3.839">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this with</text>
  <text start="451.409" dur="4.021">different sectors of the economy right</text>
  <text start="453.419" dur="6">now where they&amp;#39;re going back to where</text>
  <text start="455.43" dur="5.489">they were prior to Trump and we knew</text>
  <text start="459.419" dur="5.46">this was some type of dead cat bounce</text>
  <text start="460.919" dur="8.34">because the economy has not changed at</text>
  <text start="464.879" dur="7.26">all it is exactly the same no new jobs</text>
  <text start="469.259" dur="4.53">were really created manufacturing has</text>
  <text start="472.139" dur="4.59">not been brought back to the United</text>
  <text start="473.789" dur="5.13">States the Fed is still creating</text>
  <text start="476.729" dur="5.31">currency the Treasury is still borrowing</text>
  <text start="478.919" dur="5.55">currency China Russia and many other</text>
  <text start="482.039" dur="4.59">nations are still selling Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="484.469" dur="4.41">and we could see right now that nothing</text>
  <text start="486.629" dur="4.561">has really changed in the economy</text>
  <text start="488.879" dur="4.32">actually the debt has increased that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.19" dur="4.86">what&amp;#39;s changed the economy has gotten</text>
  <text start="493.199" dur="4.801">worse that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s changed the Fed has</text>
  <text start="496.05" dur="4.23">started raising interest rates to bring</text>
  <text start="498" dur="6.06">down the economy that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s changed</text>
  <text start="500.28" dur="5.78">and we see right now that said Fisher he</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="4.74">is out there saying that yes the economy</text>
  <text start="506.06" dur="5.44">has some weak growth right now in the</text>
  <text start="508.8" dur="5.76">first first quarter but this is</text>
  <text start="511.5" dur="6">temporary and interest rate hike should</text>
  <text start="514.56" dur="5.7">be able to proceed as planned because we</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="4.919">don&amp;#39;t see the economy being weak like</text>
  <text start="520.26" dur="4.11">this any longer it&amp;#39;s going to all of a</text>
  <text start="522.419" dur="3.961">sudden improve in the second third</text>
  <text start="524.37" dur="4.56">fourth quarter so interest rate hikes</text>
  <text start="526.38" dur="6.209">guess what they&amp;#39;re still on the table</text>
  <text start="528.93" dur="6.3">and we&amp;#39;re going to raise the rates now</text>
  <text start="532.589" dur="5.701">of course he&amp;#39;s saying this and they know</text>
  <text start="535.23" dur="6.27">for a fact that this economy is not just</text>
  <text start="538.29" dur="4.859">going to turn around they know that Wow</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="3.42">all of a sudden has the second quarter</text>
  <text start="543.149" dur="5.701">hits all of a sudden we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="544.92" dur="6.69">three four percent GDP no completely</text>
  <text start="548.85" dur="4.95">impossible but they&amp;#39;re saying this</text>
  <text start="551.61" dur="4.5">because they want to raise the interest</text>
  <text start="553.8" dur="4.59">rates every time they raise it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.11" dur="5.49">another notch which allows them to bring</text>
  <text start="558.39" dur="6.75">the economy slowed it down and crash it</text>
  <text start="561.6" dur="5.489">this is what happened in 2006-2007 they</text>
  <text start="565.14" dur="4.11">started to raise the interest rates and</text>
  <text start="567.089" dur="4.44">when the housing market started to break</text>
  <text start="569.25" dur="3.81">apart company started to fold all of a</text>
  <text start="571.529" dur="3.391">sudden they started to bring the</text>
  <text start="573.06" dur="4.35">interest rates down once again because</text>
  <text start="574.92" dur="4.62">they already got the result they wanted</text>
  <text start="577.41" dur="4.26">and they knew it was a domino effect and</text>
  <text start="579.54" dur="3.9">it would just keep going after that and</text>
  <text start="581.67" dur="3.6">didn&amp;#39;t matter where the rates went</text>
  <text start="583.44" dur="4.65">they knew that things would rapidly fall</text>
  <text start="585.27" dur="6.93">apart they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing once</text>

  <text start="833.06" dur="5.71">everything is in motion and this is why</text>
  <text start="836.51" dur="4.57">everyone needs to be ready for what is</text>
  <text start="838.77" dur="5.07">about to happen and I&amp;#39;ve said this many</text>

  <text start="850.03" dur="4.17">we can see that we&amp;#39;re heading down this</text>
  <text start="851.86" dur="5.19">path and it looks like we&amp;#39;re on the path</text>
  <text start="854.2" dur="4.71">to a complete collapse of the system all</text>
  <text start="857.05" dur="3.81">the promises of jobs coming back</text>
  <text start="858.91" dur="2.43">manufacturing that is not going to</text>
  <text start="860.86" dur="2.79">happen</text>
  <text start="861.34" dur="5.52">reducing the debt not going to happen</text>
  <text start="863.65" dur="6.03">all this stuff is not going to happen</text>
  <text start="866.86" dur="5.16">because when you look at a corporation</text>
  <text start="869.68" dur="4.35">and the corporation is in a huge amount</text>
  <text start="872.02" dur="4.23">of debt and they don&amp;#39;t have revenue</text>
  <text start="874.03" dur="5.43">coming in to pay for the interest on</text>

  <text start="889.42" dur="5.55">bankruptcy that is we need to clean</text>
  <text start="892.39" dur="6.66">house and get rid of all this so we can</text>
  <text start="894.97" dur="6.99">start over and this will be painful this</text>
  <text start="899.05" dur="5.61">is not a fun thing to go through and we</text>
  <text start="901.96" dur="4.95">can see right now this is where we are</text>
