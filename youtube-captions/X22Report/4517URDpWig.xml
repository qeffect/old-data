  <text start="264.28" dur="3.54">cyber attack event just like the Boston</text>
  <text start="265.75" dur="3.78">bombing and you have to be very careful</text>
  <text start="267.82" dur="5.6">when you play with the internet but</text>
  <text start="269.53" dur="7.79">anyhow you can</text>
  <text start="273.42" dur="6.12">see how fragile the markets are this has</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="5.69">not this had nothing to do with earnings</text>
  <text start="279.54" dur="6.69">this had nothing to do with how</text>
  <text start="283.01" dur="7.44">different businesses are doing or any of</text>
  <text start="286.23" dur="7.59">the technicals just one little blip of</text>

  <text start="310.38" dur="6.9">horrifying scares people and in the</text>
  <text start="314.73" dur="6.66">panic sets in and this is why I say the</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="6.36">human factor the central bankers have a</text>
  <text start="321.39" dur="3.39">tough time controlling because they</text>
  <text start="323.64" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t know what the hell these humans</text>
  <text start="324.78" dur="6.33">are going to do so that is their wild</text>
  <text start="328.65" dur="5.19">card yeah they can control printing</text>
  <text start="331.11" dur="6.12">money you know the gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="333.84" dur="5.97">all the financials and you know they can</text>
  <text start="337.23" dur="4.59">fund the banks they can control the</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="4.86">other nations to a point I mean their</text>
  <text start="341.82" dur="4.92">government that in that way they can</text>
  <text start="344.67" dur="6">start up wars with other countries but</text>
  <text start="346.74" dur="7.89">when the people do something out of the</text>
  <text start="350.67" dur="8.25">ordinary unexpected that can throw the</text>
  <text start="354.63" dur="6.18">entire market into a tailspin that they</text>
  <text start="358.92" dur="3.96">will not be able to stop and this is</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="3.66">what I&amp;#39;m talking about when people say</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="7.44">oh they can kick this can down forever</text>
  <text start="364.47" dur="8.82">no they they can up to a point and I</text>
  <text start="370.32" dur="6.35">thought this was a great instance of how</text>
  <text start="373.29" dur="6.27">fragile and how just a couple of words</text>
  <text start="376.67" dur="6.28">can knock down the market and make</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="5.88">people go whoa what just happened just</text>
  <text start="382.95" dur="5.01">like in the case of the Boston bombing</text>
  <text start="385.44" dur="5.07">they can close an entire city the clear</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="5.67">martial law and has people scared in</text>
  <text start="390.51" dur="5.79">their homes that didn&amp;#39;t happen over six</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="6.12">weeks a year that hope that happened in</text>
  <text start="396.3" dur="6.06">minutes so this should be telling</text>
  <text start="399.75" dur="6.17">everyone something this should be</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="6.5">showing you within minutes</text>
  <text start="405.92" dur="5.82">this could happen that&amp;#39;s the way I see</text>
  <text start="408.86" dur="5.28">it I see it as boom one minute the</text>
  <text start="411.74" dur="4.86">switch is off next minute they turn it</text>
  <text start="414.14" dur="4.35">on nobody even knows what&amp;#39;s going you</text>
  <text start="416.6" dur="8.31">don&amp;#39;t even have time to react you just</text>
  <text start="418.49" dur="9.45">do what they say okay moving on I see</text>
  <text start="424.91" dur="6.87">the war drums are getting louder I see</text>
  <text start="427.94" dur="7.43">that we&amp;#39;re trying to push war forward</text>
  <text start="431.78" dur="6.21">and I see Israel is helping with that</text>
  <text start="435.37" dur="5.26">where they&amp;#39;re saying that Syria use</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="6.83">chemical arms and it&amp;#39;s probably nerve</text>
  <text start="440.63" dur="7.95">gas of course and they are trying to get</text>
  <text start="444.82" dur="9.67">America into this war they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="448.58" dur="9.36">bring us into Iran and the Senate just</text>
  <text start="454.49" dur="5.91">passed the law you know while the Boston</text>
  <text start="457.94" dur="8">bombing was going on that we will back</text>
  <text start="460.4" dur="8.31">Israel if they go into war with Iran and</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="5.83">you know the reason when they pass this</text>
  <text start="468.71" dur="6.24">is because we are going to war with Iran</text>
  <text start="471.77" dur="5.34">when is this going to happen we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="474.95" dur="5.85">know but from what they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="477.11" dur="4.56">now they are pushing us towards that</text>
  <text start="480.8" dur="4.17">because you have to remember what</text>
  <text start="481.67" dur="5.91">President Obama said the use of chemical</text>
  <text start="484.97" dur="6.06">weapons is a red line for the united</text>
  <text start="487.58" dur="7.8">states that would trigger unspecified us</text>
  <text start="491.03" dur="6.96">action so the is really said hey all we</text>
  <text start="495.38" dur="5.4">gotta do is say they&amp;#39;re using some type</text>
  <text start="497.99" dur="4.98">of chemical arms nerve gas or whatever</text>

  <text start="521.93" dur="11.1">and they&amp;#39;re sending ships over there and</text>
  <text start="528.46" dur="7.12">this is really starting to look ugly I</text>
  <text start="533.03" dur="5.49">mean they&amp;#39;re just getting everything</text>
  <text start="535.58" dur="3.93">into position and everything is starting</text>
  <text start="538.52" dur="6.66">to move</text>
  <text start="539.51" dur="7.77">in the direction of war now us rejects</text>
  <text start="545.18" dur="8.25">North Korea&amp;#39;s demands do we recognize as</text>
  <text start="547.28" dur="7.74">a nuclear-armed state we are never the</text>
  <text start="553.43" dur="6.9">United States government and the central</text>
  <text start="555.02" dur="7.92">bankers are never going to say North</text>
  <text start="560.33" dur="6.36">Korea is a nuclear-armed state because</text>
  <text start="562.94" dur="6.87">first of all they are trading oil with</text>
  <text start="566.69" dur="7.41">Iran bypassing the US dollar they were</text>
  <text start="569.81" dur="6.57">in line with China China is trading with</text>
  <text start="574.1" dur="7.26">other countries bypassing the US dollar</text>
  <text start="576.38" dur="8.85">I don&amp;#39;t care what North Korea does the</text>
  <text start="581.36" dur="5.61">US the central bankers are never going</text>
  <text start="585.23" dur="3.96">to let them off the hook they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="4.2">to continue with the fear-mongering</text>
  <text start="589.19" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re going to continue putting</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="5.61">pressure on them until they finally do</text>
  <text start="594.32" dur="5.22">something to start the war now if they</text>
  <text start="596.78" dur="6.42">don&amp;#39;t start the war over there they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="599.54" dur="5.67">do it in Iran Syria with Israel or if</text>
  <text start="603.2" dur="4.53">that doesn&amp;#39;t start it it&amp;#39;ll be China</text>
  <text start="605.21" dur="8.31">Japan so you see what they&amp;#39;re setting up</text>
  <text start="607.73" dur="8.16">here not just one area to get us into</text>
  <text start="613.52" dur="5.85">war they&amp;#39;re setting up many different</text>
  <text start="615.89" dur="6">areas so whatever button they can push</text>
  <text start="619.37" dur="7.35">and we go into war that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="621.89" dur="12.87">we&amp;#39;re heading into the war now since the</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="13.19">Boston bombing it seems like they are</text>
  <text start="634.76" dur="8.48">now coming out with why we need drones</text>
  <text start="639.91" dur="7.2">why we need surveillance up in the air</text>
  <text start="643.24" dur="8.44">why we need to label gunpowder</text>
  <text start="647.11" dur="7.3">ammunition why we need more gun control</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="4.26">oh wait a minute the gun control kind of</text>
  <text start="654.41" dur="8.18">backfired on them with the Boston</text>

  <text start="788.9" dur="6.04">too young to even apply for a gun permit</text>

  <text start="794.94" dur="5.58">of backfired on them I mean when they</text>
  <text start="798.089" dur="5.581">stole in so background checks wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="800.52" dur="6.03">have helped in this situation because</text>
  <text start="803.67" dur="5.06">wherever they sold them from those</text>
  <text start="806.55" dur="5.01">people were clean</text>
  <text start="808.73" dur="6.76">so this whole thing is completely</text>
  <text start="811.56" dur="7.16">falling apart in their face and plus</text>
  <text start="815.49" dur="6.21">they didn&amp;#39;t use guns they used a bomb</text>
  <text start="818.72" dur="5.17">supposedly I mean this is this is their</text>

  <text start="826.92" dur="5.49">selling bomb parts and but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="829.92" dur="7.05">ridiculous but they didn&amp;#39;t use normal</text>
  <text start="832.41" dur="7.83">except for gunpowder which is really not</text>
  <text start="836.97" dur="5.07">a bomb but you know they threw that in</text>
  <text start="840.24" dur="3.9">there they&amp;#39;re using pressure cookers</text>
  <text start="842.04" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s a bill out there you know that</text>
  <text start="844.14" dur="5.01">they have to make a law against pressure</text>
  <text start="846.78" dur="4.35">cookers a mutt we might as well you know</text>
  <text start="849.15" dur="3.18">make a law against you know we need</text>

  <text start="858.87" dur="8.28">of it I mean it&amp;#39;s getting so ridiculous</text>
  <text start="861.42" dur="11.58">it&amp;#39;s unbelievable now since the Boston</text>
  <text start="867.15" dur="8.4">bombing weapons and ammo have gone right</text>
  <text start="873" dur="5.52">back into shortages again because now</text>

  <text start="878.52" dur="4.47">holy crap they&amp;#39;re telling me they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="880.47" dur="4.32">terrorists all over the place I better</text>

  <text start="898.56" dur="6.36">50 round boxes and i purchased a couple</text>
  <text start="901.44" dur="6.96">of boxes and they had like 42 in stock i</text>
  <text start="904.92" dur="5.81">look today it&amp;#39;s 0 and i&amp;#39;m like holy crap</text>

  <text start="910.73" dur="11.86">you can see that this whole entire plan</text>
  <text start="915" dur="10.32">is completely backfiring and you know</text>
  <text start="922.59" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s just amazing so we have to look at</text>
  <text start="925.32" dur="5.52">what are they going to do next what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="927.27" dur="6.12">their plan B yes Obama said he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="930.84" dur="3.99">to buy pack bypass Congress with</text>
  <text start="933.39" dur="4.68">executive orders but that&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="934.83" dur="5.92">going to do it that that doesn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="938.07" dur="6.25">anything because we have to the second</text>
  <text start="940.75" dur="6.36">amendment an executive orders and</text>
  <text start="944.32" dur="3.99">outlaws so that really can&amp;#39;t do it so</text>
  <text start="947.11" dur="4.62">they have to come up with something</text>
  <text start="948.31" dur="6.87">that&amp;#39;s going to really bring it home</text>
  <text start="951.73" dur="7.68">they need to get the guns any way they</text>
  <text start="955.18" dur="8.82">can they need to isolate groups in</text>
  <text start="959.41" dur="6.33">America so they can show that the there</text>
  <text start="964" dur="5.13">are domestic terrorists there are</text>
  <text start="965.74" dur="5.52">homegrown milla militants and they have</text>
  <text start="969.13" dur="5.64">to keep people in fear and that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="971.26" dur="7.86">see the terrorists on the railroad</text>
  <text start="974.77" dur="7.94">system that it&amp;#39;s al Qaeda with Iran ties</text>
  <text start="979.12" dur="9.66">they&amp;#39;re keeping the fear-mongering at a</text>
  <text start="982.71" dur="9.61">new level so makes it easier for them to</text>
  <text start="988.78" dur="11.27">take away more rights this is what</text>
  <text start="992.32" dur="7.73">they&amp;#39;re doing and we can see this in the</text>
  <text start="1000.08" dur="8.61">laws with the Internet sista being one</text>
  <text start="1004.98" dur="11.1">of them and a a new law which is</text>
  <text start="1008.69" dur="12.16">resolution 1580 where the UN wants to</text>
  <text start="1016.08" dur="6.75">control the internet they will monitor</text>
  <text start="1020.85" dur="4.109">it they will tax it they will do</text>
  <text start="1022.83" dur="7.65">whatever they have to but they will be</text>
  <text start="1024.959" dur="12.151">in control of it and to me the internet</text>
  <text start="1030.48" dur="9.39">is freedom the internet is our right to</text>
  <text start="1037.11" dur="6.68">be free and to have free speech and to</text>
  <text start="1039.87" dur="10.88">talk to each other plus it looks like</text>
  <text start="1043.79" dur="10.48">the the law about online taxing is</text>
  <text start="1050.75" dur="6.27">trying to get through the Congress where</text>
  <text start="1054.27" dur="5.4">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what state you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1057.02" dur="5.23">they&amp;#39;re going to tax you on all</text>
  <text start="1059.67" dur="5.28">purchases and I can see this having a</text>
  <text start="1062.25" dur="5.34">terrible effect on online businesses</text>
  <text start="1064.95" dur="4.53">because most people go to online</text>
  <text start="1067.59" dur="4.65">businesses because you don&amp;#39;t have to pay</text>
  <text start="1069.48" dur="5.279">taxes most of the time and you can get</text>
  <text start="1072.24" dur="6.059">things pretty inexpensive</text>
  <text start="1074.759" dur="8.94">but when they start putting taxes it</text>
  <text start="1078.299" dur="8.79">kind of disrupts what what the sales are</text>
  <text start="1083.699" dur="4.89">and you know why would I go to the</text>
  <text start="1087.089" dur="4.26">internet because now I have to pay tax</text>
  <text start="1088.589" dur="4.231">taxes and shipping and even if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1091.349" dur="3.45">getting free shipping i still have to</text>
  <text start="1092.82" dur="3.329">pay taxes so I might as well just go to</text>
  <text start="1094.799" dur="3.78">the store and pick it up because it</text>
  <text start="1096.149" dur="3.93">makes no sense for me to do it on the</text>
  <text start="1098.579" dur="5.73">internet and they&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="1100.079" dur="10.29">revenue of internet businesses go down</text>
  <text start="1104.309" dur="9.9">because of this now Representative Mike</text>
  <text start="1110.369" dur="7.56">Rogers says that these Chinese cyber</text>
  <text start="1114.209" dur="8.7">terrorism is going to make 911 pale in</text>
  <text start="1117.929" dur="8.94">comparison and basically what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1122.909" dur="8.88">saying is that Chinese hackers connected</text>
  <text start="1126.869" dur="7.23">to the Chinese government we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1131.789" dur="6.75">inquiring about us infrastructure such</text>
  <text start="1134.099" dur="6.54">as energy the pipeline&amp;#39;s water treatment</text>
  <text start="1138.539" dur="5.31">facility facilities and financial</text>
  <text start="1140.639" dur="8.27">institutions basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1143.849" dur="11.091">doing is they are setting this whole</text>
  <text start="1148.909" dur="9.25">entire cyber attack up for the big event</text>
  <text start="1154.94" dur="6.429">we saw the Chinese government and</text>
  <text start="1158.159" dur="7.38">general I think was a dempsey stating</text>
  <text start="1161.369" dur="9.45">that a cyber attack is as is as a</text>
  <text start="1165.539" dur="8.07">effective as a nuclear bomb and I said</text>
  <text start="1170.819" dur="6.18">this yesterday and more and more reports</text>
  <text start="1173.609" dur="6.02">are coming out and you can see this is</text>
  <text start="1176.999" dur="5.37">the direction they&amp;#39;re heading in and</text>
  <text start="1179.629" dur="6.07">they President Obama is even putting</text>
  <text start="1182.369" dur="5.071">sanctions on the Chinese because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1185.699" dur="4.55">where they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s coming from</text>
  <text start="1187.44" dur="5.219">and of course they have no clue I mean</text>
  <text start="1190.249" dur="6.191">we have no idea where this is coming</text>
  <text start="1192.659" dur="5.76">from because these hackers use proxy</text>
  <text start="1196.44" dur="4.679">servers they and they can bounce it</text>
  <text start="1198.419" dur="4.95">anywhere from anywhere i can use proxy</text>
  <text start="1201.119" dur="5.581">servers you can go on the internet just</text>
  <text start="1203.369" dur="4.721">google proxy free proxy servers or paid</text>
  <text start="1206.7" dur="3.339">proxy servers</text>
  <text start="1208.09" dur="5.1">it will give you a different address and</text>
  <text start="1210.039" dur="4.861">show whatever you&amp;#39;re doing you can do</text>
  <text start="1213.19" dur="4.05">all your browsing through the proxy</text>
  <text start="1214.9" dur="5.25">server and it will hide your identity</text>
  <text start="1217.24" dur="6.87">and it will show you it will show the</text>
  <text start="1220.15" dur="5.759">person looking and watching you come</text>
  <text start="1224.11" dur="5.37">into their website as coming from a</text>
  <text start="1225.909" dur="5.01">different country so they have no clue</text>
  <text start="1229.48" dur="10.38">this is where it&amp;#39;s coming from they have</text>
  <text start="1230.919" dur="12.661">no idea and this cyber event is going to</text>
  <text start="1239.86" dur="8.22">bring us I believe the way they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1243.58" dur="9.569">setting it up into a war and the only</text>
  <text start="1248.08" dur="11.19">way to do that is to make the American</text>
  <text start="1253.149" dur="14.551">people suffer make them want war make</text>
  <text start="1259.27" dur="9.87">them feel angry pissed off and this is</text>
  <text start="1267.7" dur="4.849">the only way to do it they did it with</text>
  <text start="1269.14" dur="6.95">911 they did it with Pearl Harbor and</text>
  <text start="1272.549" dur="7.661">people get outraged but we are so</text>
  <text start="1276.09" dur="8.23">sleeping right now we are so in a daze</text>
  <text start="1280.21" dur="7.74">right now that it takes more and more to</text>
  <text start="1284.32" dur="5.79">snap the American people awake to see</text>
  <text start="1287.95" dur="5.07">what&amp;#39;s happening because most of the</text>
  <text start="1290.11" dur="4.98">people are so into themselves they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1293.02" dur="5.49">even see it and less there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1295.09" dur="9.15">horrific happening they have no clue</text>
  <text start="1298.51" dur="8.61">they have no idea they have no way to</text>
  <text start="1304.24" dur="4.35">understand what needs to be done so the</text>
  <text start="1307.12" dur="4.14">government is going to make them</text>
  <text start="1308.59" dur="5.88">understand what needs to be done in this</text>
  <text start="1311.26" dur="5.82">situation plus it enables the government</text>
  <text start="1314.47" dur="5.67">and the central bankers to rob the</text>
  <text start="1317.08" dur="5.28">people of their money because they can</text>
  <text start="1320.14" dur="7.05">siphon the money off from the banks</text>
  <text start="1322.36" dur="7.11">during the cyber attack now is that the</text>
  <text start="1327.19" dur="4.8">only way they can get their money no but</text>
  <text start="1329.47" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s sure hits home when you know you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1414.11" dur="5.94">to do this the central bankers to cover</text>
  <text start="1416.6" dur="5.88">up this an economic collapse and what</text>
  <text start="1420.05" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s so easy to blame just like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1422.48" dur="7.61">doing now it was China it was North</text>
  <text start="1424.91" dur="8.61">Korea it was Iran it is so easy to do</text>
  <text start="1430.09" dur="7.39">and this is the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1433.52" dur="6.21">continually letting us know there are</text>
  <text start="1437.48" dur="4.95">other terrorists out there there are</text>

  <text start="1450.74" dur="10.8">fear mongering right now now right now</text>
  <text start="1458.84" dur="4.05">since the Boston bombing since you know</text>
  <text start="1461.54" dur="4.4">we&amp;#39;re talking about terrorism and</text>
  <text start="1462.89" dur="5.94">everything like that the government is</text>
  <text start="1465.94" dur="5.08">debating on their anti-terrorism bill</text>
  <text start="1468.83" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s amazing how quickly these bills</text>
  <text start="1471.02" dur="3.78">just appear out of nowhere just like the</text>
  <text start="1473.69" dur="4.56">Patriot Act</text>
  <text start="1474.8" dur="5.91">appeared out of nowhere when the 911</text>
  <text start="1478.25" dur="5.07">happened it just it&amp;#39;s just all of a</text>
  <text start="1480.71" dur="5.6">sudden it just they just have them ready</text>
  <text start="1483.32" dur="6.54">to go just like the Sandy Hook shooting</text>
  <text start="1486.31" dur="5.26">holy we have the gun legislation ready</text>
  <text start="1489.86" dur="2.88">to go we did was just sitting on our</text>
  <text start="1491.57" dur="3.54">desk they were just waiting for the</text>
  <text start="1492.74" dur="6.12">event and the same things going to</text>
  <text start="1495.11" dur="6.15">happen you know as we move forward they</text>

  <text start="1512.96" dur="11.76">for the anti-terrorism does two things</text>
  <text start="1517.73" dur="9.05">that I&amp;#39;m going to read them to you the</text>
  <text start="1524.72" dur="4.59">first one is preventive detention</text>
  <text start="1526.78" dur="5.98">meaning someone can be held in custody</text>
  <text start="1529.31" dur="6.15">for up to three days just on a suspicion</text>
  <text start="1532.76" dur="5.85">of being involved in a terrorism but</text>
  <text start="1535.46" dur="6.33">without charge being laid the person can</text>
  <text start="1538.61" dur="8.55">then be bound by certain probationary</text>
  <text start="1541.79" dur="8.25">conditions for up to one year and if he</text>
  <text start="1547.16" dur="7.86">or she refuses can be jailed for 12</text>
  <text start="1550.04" dur="7.17">months the second is an investigative</text>
