  <text start="123.77" dur="4.89">what their actions are not what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="125.929" dur="5.42">talking about but we need to see and</text>
  <text start="128.66" dur="5.61">follow what they&amp;#39;re actually doing</text>

  <text start="159.2" dur="5.86">changing the economic landscape now he</text>
  <text start="162.709" dur="4.571">sent a warning tweet a</text>

  <text start="167.28" dur="5.459">their products if they continue a plan</text>
  <text start="169.709" dur="5.071">for manufacturing in China now we know</text>
  <text start="172.739" dur="4.11">that Trump he&amp;#39;s pushing to make a deal</text>
  <text start="174.78" dur="5.67">with China we know that he&amp;#39;s placed</text>
  <text start="176.849" dur="7.351">tariffs on China we know that this is to</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="5.52">force companies out of China maybe into</text>
  <text start="184.2" dur="4.11">another country or back to United States</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="5.43">preferably back into the United States</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="6.45">and if you follow the basic roadmap of</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="4.919">America first there is a very clear</text>
  <text start="194.76" dur="4.259">picture now Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="196.319" dur="5.341">following Apple will not be given tariff</text>

  <text start="218.549" dur="6.361">to be hit with tariffs if you make them</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="6.84">in the US there&amp;#39;s no penalty and that is</text>
  <text start="224.91" dur="7.799">subtle as a brick through a window but</text>
  <text start="228.63" dur="7.53">if you read into what Trump is saying he</text>
  <text start="232.709" dur="7.59">is telling Apple you&amp;#39;re going to get hit</text>
  <text start="236.16" dur="5.79">with penalties now secretary Ross warned</text>
  <text start="240.299" dur="4.231">the professional investment class that</text>

  <text start="252.239" dur="6.511">they left off when talks collapsed</text>
  <text start="253.889" dur="6.511">that&amp;#39;s a very big tell Trump is not</text>
  <text start="258.75" dur="3.269">going to accept anything less than a</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="3.989">full and complete structural change in</text>
  <text start="262.019" dur="5.911">the US trade position with China now</text>
  <text start="264.389" dur="6.381">within this trade deal there are certain</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="6.989">compliance and enforcement clauses and</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="7.54">they are non-negotiable Trump will not</text>
  <text start="274.919" dur="7.591">negotiate on these now in the message to</text>

  <text start="304.979" dur="5.581">for Trump against the Democrats we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="5.07">been seeing change around the world and</text>
  <text start="310.56" dur="6.259">we need to keep in mind of the date</text>
  <text start="312.84" dur="7.549">October 21st 2019 that&amp;#39;s the Canadian</text>
  <text start="316.819" dur="7.57">election if Justin Trudeau from Canada</text>

  <text start="360.87" dur="5.579">will last for a very long time now when</text>
  <text start="365.039" dur="3.391">you start to look at this and you step</text>
  <text start="366.449" dur="4.44">back a little bit you can see Trump he</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="6.15">is positioning for an economic platform</text>
  <text start="370.889" dur="6.75">in 2020 with specific deliverables none</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="5.69">of the 2022 candidates have any economic</text>

  <text start="386.37" dur="6.75">about trade or economics they talk about</text>
  <text start="388.259" dur="7.891">nothing and he&amp;#39;s trying to position all</text>

  <text start="524.54" dur="6.88">implement their digital tax on the US</text>
  <text start="528.09" dur="6.06">and we can see that Trump he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="531.42" dur="5.22">playing around and we know that many of</text>
  <text start="534.15" dur="4.73">these countries they need funding</text>
  <text start="536.64" dur="4.86">because they&amp;#39;re in a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="538.88" dur="5.98">most of the countries in Europe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="6.63">ready to collapse under the debt that</text>
  <text start="544.86" dur="5.19">they continually incur and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.13" dur="3.99">trying to figure out a way to pay for</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="5.97">all this they were going down the path</text>
  <text start="552.12" dur="6.06">of global warming to put a carbon tax on</text>
  <text start="556.02" dur="4.62">everyone and hopefully that would offset</text>
  <text start="558.18" dur="6.75">everything but that has not worked out</text>
  <text start="560.64" dur="5.73">for them and we already see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="564.93" dur="5.34">trying to maneuver</text>
  <text start="566.37" dur="7.05">away to place taxes in other areas and</text>
  <text start="570.27" dur="4.92">Trump is stomping them the White House</text>
  <text start="573.42" dur="3.81">came out and they made a statement</text>
  <text start="575.19" dur="7.29">saying that the u.s. is extremely</text>
  <text start="577.23" dur="8.16">disappointed by the tax and we know why</text>

  <text start="594.21" dur="5.55">low interest rates stimulus and they</text>
  <text start="597.72" dur="2.7">tried to end this and everything started</text>
  <text start="599.76" dur="2.49">to fall apart</text>
  <text start="600.42" dur="4.169">the Patriots stepped in and said whoa</text>

  <text start="718" dur="7.11">first let&amp;#39;s just look at the ECB</text>
  <text start="721.99" dur="5.49">statement and it says as market mature</text>
  <text start="725.11" dur="4.76">central bank&amp;#39;s conclude that a formal</text>
  <text start="727.48" dur="4.98">gold agreement is no longer necessary</text>
  <text start="729.87" dur="4.45">signatories of the fourth central bank</text>
  <text start="732.46" dur="3.54">gold agreement no longer seen need for</text>

  <text start="736" dur="4.74">and matured signatory central banks</text>
  <text start="738.88" dur="3.69">confirmed Gore remains an important</text>
  <text start="740.74" dur="4.02">important element of global monetary</text>

  <text start="744.76" dur="7.17">plans to sell significant amounts of</text>
  <text start="747.55" dur="7.2">gold so central banks they haven&amp;#39;t sold</text>
  <text start="751.93" dur="4.71">gold in ten years since their strategy</text>
  <text start="754.75" dur="4.4">is strictly to by their agreement</text>
  <text start="756.64" dur="6.03">regarding the selling of gold becomes</text>
  <text start="759.15" dur="6.939">absolutely pointless what does this tell</text>
  <text start="762.67" dur="5.58">us it tells us they&amp;#39;re gonna be holding</text>
  <text start="766.089" dur="3.75">on to their gold why are they holding on</text>
  <text start="768.25" dur="3.69">to their gold why are they just</text>
  <text start="769.839" dur="5.671">purchasing why aren&amp;#39;t they selling</text>
  <text start="771.94" dur="6.93">anymore because they understand that</text>
  <text start="775.51" dur="7.34">their system is collapsing their fiat</text>
  <text start="778.87" dur="7.14">currency is going to be worth Zippo</text>
  <text start="782.85" dur="5.44">what&amp;#39;s going to be worth something gold</text>
  <text start="786.01" dur="5.13">this is why they&amp;#39;re not selling it this</text>
  <text start="788.29" dur="4.65">is why they&amp;#39;re purchasing it I know over</text>
  <text start="791.14" dur="4.23">the many many many years they&amp;#39;ve told us</text>
  <text start="792.94" dur="4.71">that gold isn&amp;#39;t important we just hold</text>
  <text start="795.37" dur="4.41">it as a relic it means absolutely</text>
  <text start="797.65" dur="5.189">nothing Bernanke was out there saying</text>
  <text start="799.78" dur="6.42">this when Senator Ron Paul was</text>
  <text start="802.839" dur="6.451">questioning him but it turns out the</text>
  <text start="806.2" dur="6.3">central banks understand that gold is</text>
  <text start="809.29" dur="5.61">money this is why they&amp;#39;re buying it this</text>
  <text start="812.5" dur="4.32">is why they&amp;#39;re saying we&amp;#39;re not selling</text>
  <text start="814.9" dur="5.88">it so this agreement is absolutely</text>
  <text start="816.82" dur="6.06">worthless this is telling us that the</text>
  <text start="820.78" dur="4.679">system is coming down which tells us if</text>
  <text start="822.88" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re holding on to gold and they&amp;#39;re</text>
