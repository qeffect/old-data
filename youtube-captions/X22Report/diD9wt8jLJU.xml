  <text start="57.58" dur="5.009">that the economy is continually</text>
  <text start="59.62" dur="7.53">declining not getting better whatsoever</text>
  <text start="62.589" dur="7.411">and we see out in Australia retail is</text>
  <text start="67.15" dur="5.719">struggling out there and building</text>
  <text start="70" dur="5.58">approvals or on a downward trend and</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="4.511">things are not looking good in Australia</text>
  <text start="75.58" dur="4.44">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this a lot in</text>
  <text start="77.38" dur="4.41">many different countries right now where</text>
  <text start="80.02" dur="3.45">things are starting to rapidly fall</text>

  <text start="97.66" dur="4.65">there are certain areas like the united</text>

  <text start="110.44" dur="4.59">indicators that we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="111.82" dur="5.79">now they are showing us that things are</text>
  <text start="115.03" dur="6.12">rapidly deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="117.61" dur="7.14">and every time we look at these we say</text>
  <text start="121.15" dur="5.73">okay here&amp;#39;s where we were now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="124.75" dur="4.159">gotten even worse and it&amp;#39;s signal</text>
  <text start="126.88" dur="6.54">signaling us that we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="128.909" dur="7.871">we see the is M New York it just dropped</text>
  <text start="133.42" dur="6">to 50.4 this is just barely above the</text>
  <text start="136.78" dur="6.179">contraction point and it is the lowest</text>
  <text start="139.42" dur="6.209">since 2015 but what we see is the</text>
  <text start="142.959" dur="6.211">employment print of the New York is M</text>
  <text start="145.629" dur="6.151">and that collapsed adjust 40.9 this is</text>
  <text start="149.17" dur="5.16">the second worst print in the current</text>
  <text start="151.78" dur="7.819">decade and we talk a lot about</text>
  <text start="154.33" dur="7.919">manufacturing and manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="159.599" dur="4.451">declining it&amp;#39;s deteriorating it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.249" dur="4.981">getting worse ever</text>
  <text start="164.05" dur="4.88">every time we look at it we know since</text>
  <text start="167.23" dur="5.46">the last job numbers we lost about</text>
  <text start="168.93" dur="7.38">29,000 manufacturing jobs and in 60</text>
  <text start="172.69" dur="6.81">years the US economy has not suffered a</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="5.5">16-month continuous urine ear drop in</text>
  <text start="179.5" dur="4.59">factory orders without being in</text>
  <text start="181.81" dur="5.13">recession we have confirmation from the</text>
  <text start="184.09" dur="5.82">Department of Commerce that said yeah</text>
  <text start="186.94" dur="5.82">this is what happened the factory orders</text>
  <text start="189.91" dur="4.8">drop for 16 consecutive months yarn year</text>
  <text start="192.76" dur="4.8">and they declined by one point seven</text>
  <text start="194.71" dur="6.51">percent from last month so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.56" dur="6.6">looking at right now is things in the</text>
  <text start="201.22" dur="9.42">economy like manufacturing people</text>
  <text start="204.16" dur="11.87">ordering employment GDP retail housing</text>
  <text start="210.64" dur="8.39">it&amp;#39;s all sinking it&amp;#39;s declining it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="6.31">deteriorating it&amp;#39;s not getting better</text>
  <text start="219.03" dur="4.54">now of course the US government central</text>
  <text start="222.34" dur="3.6">bankers want you&amp;#39;re looking at the stock</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="4.02">market and everyone looks over there and</text>
  <text start="225.94" dur="3.69">says everything has to be fine what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.59" dur="4.29">the problem here but the stock market</text>
  <text start="229.63" dur="4.109">doesn&amp;#39;t match up to what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="231.88" dur="4.829">on in the economy and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="233.739" dur="4.861">before back in 1929 we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="236.709" dur="4.171">before back in two thousand one we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="238.6" dur="5.16">seen this before back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="240.88" dur="5.04">eight where all of a sudden out of</text>
  <text start="243.76" dur="6.24">nowhere which they like you to believe</text>
  <text start="245.92" dur="5.88">the market just drops and it&amp;#39;s cut in</text>
  <text start="250" dur="5.28">half how did this happen it just</text>
  <text start="251.8" dur="6.51">happened no if you&amp;#39;re following the</text>
  <text start="255.28" dur="5.519">economy there&amp;#39;s many different things</text>
  <text start="258.31" dur="5.22">that lead up to this up to that point</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="5.581">and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="8.07">we&amp;#39;ve been following the deterioration</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="9.75">of the economy and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="271.6" dur="7.65">earnings from companies well the first</text>
  <text start="276.13" dur="6.9">quarter earnings of this year they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.25" dur="6.39">going to decline and what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="5.7">see is something we haven&amp;#39;t seen since</text>
  <text start="285.64" dur="6.12">the last financial crisis because</text>
  <text start="288.73" dur="6.09">revenues of the SP 500 companies are now</text>
  <text start="291.76" dur="5.64">expected to decline by 1.1 percent in</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="4.2">the first quarter at the end</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="3.42">of the fourth quarter before company</text>
  <text start="299.02" dur="4.41">began reporting their fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="300.82" dur="5.64">results revenues were expected to</text>
  <text start="303.43" dur="4.59">decline by three-point-two percent now</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="5.51">everything after everything was said and</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="7.769">done revenues tracked by factset</text>
  <text start="311.97" dur="5.65">actually fell by five point five percent</text>
  <text start="315.789" dur="4.261">the fifth quarter in a row</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="5.609">year-over-year where revenues have</text>
  <text start="320.05" dur="6.69">declined now we haven&amp;#39;t seen anything</text>
  <text start="323.229" dur="5.28">like this since factset started tracking</text>
  <text start="326.74" dur="5.13">the data in the third quarter of two</text>
  <text start="328.509" dur="5.641">thousand eight now we know we have a</text>
  <text start="331.87" dur="3.66">booming stock market because the central</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="3.72">banker is the US government they keep</text>
  <text start="335.53" dur="7.65">reminding us of that that the stock</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="8.34">market is at all time new highs and what</text>
  <text start="343.18" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="346.21" dur="5.579">getting these indicators these economic</text>
  <text start="348.4" dur="5.389">indicators that track back to two</text>
  <text start="351.789" dur="7.591">thousand eight and most of them are</text>
  <text start="353.789" dur="7.781">worse than 2008 now think about this for</text>
  <text start="359.38" dur="5.43">a second if these economic economic</text>
  <text start="361.57" dur="6.18">indicators are worse than 2008 how in</text>
  <text start="364.81" dur="5.789">the world are we in any type of recovery</text>
  <text start="367.75" dur="5.909">whatsoever I know the unemployment</text>
  <text start="370.599" dur="4.891">numbers they&amp;#39;re continually telling us</text>
  <text start="373.659" dur="3.211">that people are getting jobs even though</text>
  <text start="375.49" dur="3.359">the unemployment went up to five percent</text>
  <text start="376.87" dur="3.45">but that&amp;#39;s just a little blip because</text>
  <text start="378.849" dur="3.211">there are so many layoffs they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="380.32" dur="4.23">keep track up with the manipulation</text>
  <text start="382.06" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s going on here but what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="384.55" dur="5.429">not saying is the quality of jobs aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="387.13" dur="4.59">there if you take a full-time job that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.979" dur="4.381">making seventy eighty ninety thousand</text>
  <text start="391.72" dur="6.09">dollars a year and you replace it with a</text>
  <text start="394.36" dur="4.799">part-time job there&amp;#39;s something wrong in</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="3.18">the economy and this is what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="399.159" dur="3.841">happening we&amp;#39;ve been removing the</text>
  <text start="400.99" dur="3.6">manufacturing jobs and these people have</text>
  <text start="403" dur="4.05">been getting service sector jobs and</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="4.44">they can&amp;#39;t survive on one they need to</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="3.839">get one two three four and once they get</text>
  <text start="409.03" dur="4.22">one two three four those are counted as</text>
  <text start="410.889" dur="5.221">one two three four full-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="4.599">this is why we have this illusion right</text>
  <text start="416.11" dur="5.97">now but they don&amp;#39;t want to talk about</text>
  <text start="417.849" dur="7.261">that now despite the market continually</text>
  <text start="422.08" dur="6.63">booming and everything fine we see the</text>
  <text start="425.11" dur="5.64">IPO market is in the worst shape since</text>
  <text start="428.71" dur="4.26">2009 and</text>
  <text start="430.75" dur="7.25">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a lot of things</text>
  <text start="432.97" dur="8.33">don&amp;#39;t match up with the central bankers</text>
  <text start="438" dur="6.43">manipulated statistical information and</text>
  <text start="441.3" dur="5.08">this is getting worse and worse as time</text>
  <text start="444.43" dur="5.91">goes on and they&amp;#39;re going to have a very</text>
  <text start="446.38" dur="6.48">difficult time keeping this going now</text>
  <text start="450.34" dur="5.25">very interestingly the IMF president</text>
  <text start="452.86" dur="5.16">Christine Lagarde admitted that for the</text>
  <text start="455.59" dur="4.56">IMF and this is for any central bank</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="6.899">because this is how central banks work</text>
  <text start="460.15" dur="7.92">they profit on debt on the interest on</text>
  <text start="464.919" dur="7.141">the debt that is their product for the</text>
  <text start="468.07" dur="10.5">IMF to thrive the world has to go down</text>
  <text start="472.06" dur="9.54">hill so she added that when the world</text>
  <text start="478.57" dur="7.26">goes well and we&amp;#39;ve had years of growth</text>
  <text start="481.6" dur="6.569">as was the case back in 2006-2007 the</text>
  <text start="485.83" dur="4.44">IMF doesn&amp;#39;t do that well financially and</text>
  <text start="488.169" dur="5.221">otherwise because you&amp;#39;re not taking out</text>
  <text start="490.27" dur="5.55">loans you don&amp;#39;t owe this money to the</text>
  <text start="493.39" dur="6">central bank they can&amp;#39;t step into the</text>
  <text start="495.82" dur="6.96">country and buy up all the assets on</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="7.89">pennies on the dollar and what she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.78" dur="6.6">saying is once the world deteriorates to</text>
  <text start="507.28" dur="4.23">a point where they can&amp;#39;t make it on</text>
  <text start="509.38" dur="4.98">their own and they need to continually</text>
  <text start="511.51" dur="4.8">borrow and borrow and borrow this is</text>
  <text start="514.36" dur="5.1">when the central bank&amp;#39;s really really</text>
  <text start="516.31" dur="8.33">thrive because they&amp;#39;re able to capture</text>
  <text start="519.46" dur="10.53">all the physical hard assets they get to</text>
  <text start="524.64" dur="9.55">rape and pillage countries and at this</text>
  <text start="529.99" dur="8.7">point we can see the world is flooded</text>
  <text start="534.19" dur="8.22">with debt and at this point the central</text>
  <text start="538.69" dur="6.84">banks are capturing all of these hard</text>
  <text start="542.41" dur="5.85">assets and they always do this right</text>
  <text start="545.53" dur="4.23">before the entire system collapses</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="3.06">because they don&amp;#39;t want to be stuck with</text>
  <text start="549.76" dur="4.8">all this paper and ink that&amp;#39;s worthless</text>
  <text start="551.32" dur="8.91">if they have land if they have ports if</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="9.719">they have gold they have anything that</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="8.76">is physical that you can touch and feel</text>
  <text start="564.279" dur="6.87">that&amp;#39;s worth something this is what they</text>
  <text start="568.99" dur="3.659">want this is why when people say well</text>
  <text start="571.149" dur="2.85">why don&amp;#39;t they just print up as much</text>
  <text start="572.649" dur="3.841">paper in it because they want and keep</text>
  <text start="573.999" dur="5.13">it all because they know it&amp;#39;s worthless</text>
  <text start="576.49" dur="5.399">they know they&amp;#39;re just creating out of</text>
  <text start="579.129" dur="4.171">thin air and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="581.889" dur="3.36">happen is the system&amp;#39;s going to die so</text>
  <text start="583.3" dur="4.68">they don&amp;#39;t want to hold on to it they</text>
  <text start="585.249" dur="5.361">want to trade it in for the hard assets</text>
  <text start="587.98" dur="7.76">and this is what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="590.61" dur="8.349">now we see today that there was an</text>
  <text start="595.74" dur="6.399">unprecedented link of what&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="598.959" dur="5.37">Panama papers and there was something</text>
  <text start="602.139" dur="4.26">like 11 million documents there are a</text>
  <text start="604.329" dur="4.831">lot of politicians a lot of world</text>
  <text start="606.399" dur="4.891">leaders a lot of companies like 200,000</text>
  <text start="609.16" dur="3.869">companies foundations trusts and</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="3.779">everything else that was thrown into</text>
  <text start="613.029" dur="3.54">here and if you notice there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="615.069" dur="2.88">different agendas associated with this</text>
  <text start="616.569" dur="4.62">and if you notice on the top of the list</text>
  <text start="617.949" dur="6.05">they had like Putin they had President</text>
  <text start="621.189" dur="4.861">Xi Jinping and they had many other</text>
  <text start="623.999" dur="4.06">leaders going throughout this they threw</text>
  <text start="626.05" dur="4.979">in some of the private western central</text>
  <text start="628.059" dur="7.171">bank leaders just as good measure but we</text>
  <text start="631.029" dur="5.971">can see the agenda on this is not just</text>
  <text start="635.23" dur="5.49">one there&amp;#39;s many different agendas in</text>
  <text start="637" dur="6.949">this one again going back to that</text>
  <text start="640.72" dur="8.52">operation where they&amp;#39;re going to hit</text>
  <text start="643.949" dur="8.351">China Russia and make them look evil</text>
  <text start="649.24" dur="8.73">this is part of it the other agenda</text>
  <text start="652.3" dur="9.63">might be that this is maybe the signal</text>
  <text start="657.97" dur="5.76">that the war on cash has started because</text>
  <text start="661.93" dur="5.49">what they&amp;#39;re saying is look these people</text>
  <text start="663.73" dur="6.32">are hiding cash maybe we should get rid</text>
  <text start="667.42" dur="5.009">of cash because if we get rid of cash</text>
  <text start="670.05" dur="4.599">it&amp;#39;ll be easier to track things and we</text>
  <text start="672.429" dur="5.551">know there was a call to get rid of cash</text>
  <text start="674.649" dur="5.94">and they&amp;#39;re going to push this and we</text>
  <text start="677.98" dur="4.919">can see right now this by pushing this</text>
  <text start="680.589" dur="5.31">and all this information out there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="682.899" dur="5.49">creating chaos they have many different</text>
  <text start="685.899" dur="5.88">agendas associated with it and if you</text>
  <text start="688.389" dur="6.961">notice what&amp;#39;s left I&amp;#39;ll look what&amp;#39;s left</text>
  <text start="691.779" dur="5.821">off of all of this that is American</text>
  <text start="695.35" dur="6.09">politicians</text>
  <text start="697.6" dur="8.58">if you really look at the list it looks</text>
  <text start="701.44" dur="8.85">like America is squeaky clean no one</text>
  <text start="706.18" dur="5.909">deals in any type of criminal activity</text>
  <text start="710.29" dur="3.33">or anything like that and we know all</text>
  <text start="712.089" dur="4.411">these world leaders are all the same</text>
