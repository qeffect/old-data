  <text start="97.31" dur="5.43">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="99.619" dur="7.021">financial news now the central bankers</text>
  <text start="102.74" dur="6.5">they understand that their system which</text>
  <text start="106.64" dur="5.49">they designed does not last forever</text>
  <text start="109.24" dur="6.1">there comes a point in time where their</text>
  <text start="112.13" dur="5.34">system needs to be reset where they need</text>
  <text start="115.34" dur="5.52">to take what they have at this moment</text>
  <text start="117.47" dur="5.82">create some type of an event I make it</text>
  <text start="120.86" dur="5.1">seem like they needed to start a new</text>
  <text start="123.29" dur="4.02">system because of that event and when I</text>
  <text start="125.96" dur="4.65">say event it could be a war or something</text>
  <text start="127.31" dur="7.47">like that normally it&amp;#39;s a war and this</text>
  <text start="130.61" dur="5.97">time they don&amp;#39;t have that and they know</text>
  <text start="134.78" dur="4.8">that their system is coming down now</text>
  <text start="136.58" dur="5.37">what&amp;#39;s very odd about all of this is</text>
  <text start="139.58" dur="6.92">they&amp;#39;re doing a lot of different strange</text>
  <text start="141.95" dur="9.06">things first they&amp;#39;re continuing the idea</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="5.86">that migrants are needed in all of these</text>
  <text start="151.01" dur="4.97">countries and you have to think yourself</text>
  <text start="152.36" dur="6.33">well why do they need migrants well</text>
  <text start="155.98" dur="5.56">Christine Lagarde came out she she&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="158.69" dur="6.06">head of the IMF and she said that Spain</text>
  <text start="161.54" dur="5.88">must open its borders to more than 5</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="7.489">million migrants over the coming decades</text>
  <text start="167.42" dur="8.25">in order to fund the pension system now</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="5.891">what she&amp;#39;s saying here is they need more</text>
  <text start="175.67" dur="6.36">people in the country so they can</text>
  <text start="178.13" dur="6.88">actually contribute to the pension</text>
  <text start="182.03" dur="5.05">system to keep it up and running</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="4.649">and normally what countries do is they</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="4.86">bring in more and more people into their</text>
  <text start="189.659" dur="6.451">country to help the GDP numbers to help</text>
  <text start="191.94" dur="7.32">the economy why would you need more and</text>
  <text start="196.11" dur="5.459">more individuals in a country where</text>
  <text start="199.26" dur="5.369">their unemployment rate their youth</text>
  <text start="201.569" dur="5.821">unemployment rate is at 34% you have</text>
  <text start="204.629" dur="5.731">plenty of individuals that will go out</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="5.79">and take jobs well what happens is the</text>
  <text start="210.36" dur="6.36">central banking system it has destroyed</text>
  <text start="213.18" dur="5.43">the job market there are no longer these</text>
  <text start="216.72" dur="5.4">high-paying jobs as we can see in many</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="5.129">areas wages are coming down there are</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="4.14">low-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="7.231">and usually the migrants that come in</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="6.93">they fill these jobs this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="4.859">seeing high unemployment all over the</text>
  <text start="233.19" dur="4.98">globe right now because what is</text>
  <text start="235.829" dur="5.52">happening is there&amp;#39;s no place for these</text>
  <text start="238.17" dur="5.879">highly educated individuals to go they</text>
  <text start="241.349" dur="4.651">don&amp;#39;t want to take those jobs and this</text>
  <text start="244.049" dur="3.931">is why they&amp;#39;re trying to bring in these</text>
  <text start="246" dur="4.38">migrants into all these different</text>
  <text start="247.98" dur="3.96">countries because it will keep their</text>
  <text start="250.38" dur="4.56">system going a little bit longer</text>
  <text start="251.94" dur="7.229">remember they thought that their system</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="7.349">would be reset by now or in the process</text>
  <text start="259.169" dur="4.531">of being reset and they didn&amp;#39;t care how</text>
  <text start="262.289" dur="4.021">long a war lasts or anything like that</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="5.07">because it reduces the population and it</text>
  <text start="266.31" dur="4.89">allows them to explain away why there</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="6">are shortages why you can&amp;#39;t get certain</text>
  <text start="271.2" dur="5.81">items and it allows them to reset the</text>
  <text start="274.77" dur="5.91">entire thing now the entire economic</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="7.48">system is completely falling apart right</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="5.669">now the debt level is reaching a point</text>
  <text start="284.49" dur="3.27">where it cannot be sustained and no a</text>
  <text start="286.349" dur="5.271">lot of people think oh yes they can</text>
  <text start="287.76" dur="7.74">sustain it no they can&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="291.62" dur="6.88">mathematically impossible yes they can</text>
  <text start="295.5" dur="6.27">create more currency but use common</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="6.09">sense if you have your household or</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="4.14">you&amp;#39;re an individual and you keep taking</text>
  <text start="304.59" dur="3.359">out credit cards and you&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="305.91" dur="3.84">twenty five or thirty thousand dollars a</text>
  <text start="307.949" dur="3.961">year and you take this credit card for</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="3.9">ten thousand bring it up to the max take</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="3.27">out this credit card bring it up to the</text>
  <text start="313.65" dur="3.36">max take this credit card bring it up to</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="3.42">the max and your interest rate is at 30</text>
  <text start="317.01" dur="3.81">percent</text>
  <text start="318.6" dur="4.29">you cannot sustained it now if the</text>
  <text start="320.82" dur="5.4">interest rate drops you can take out</text>
  <text start="322.89" dur="6.17">more debt but there comes a point where</text>
  <text start="326.22" dur="4.95">you can&amp;#39;t do this anymore</text>
  <text start="329.06" dur="4.51">governments around the world they are</text>
  <text start="331.17" dur="4.92">running into this problem and if we look</text>
  <text start="333.57" dur="3.42">at the debt problem total household debt</text>
  <text start="336.09" dur="3">and I&amp;#39;m not just talking about</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="4.86">governance I&amp;#39;m talking about everyday</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="4.83">people also they can&amp;#39;t sustained the</text>
  <text start="341.85" dur="3.78">amount of debt remember our entire</text>
  <text start="343.92" dur="5.25">system is designed by central bankers</text>
  <text start="345.63" dur="6.15">that designed it around debt so total</text>
  <text start="349.17" dur="5.97">household debt it hit a new record high</text>
  <text start="351.78" dur="5.79">rising by eighty two billion two three</text>
  <text start="355.14" dur="4.83">thirteen point two nine trillion in the</text>
  <text start="357.57" dur="6.02">second quarter of 2018 three point five</text>
  <text start="359.97" dur="6.39">percent higher than a year earlier I</text>
  <text start="363.59" dur="6.13">mean this is not a good situation for</text>
  <text start="366.36" dur="6.87">the everyday person because salaries</text>
  <text start="369.72" dur="4.86">aren&amp;#39;t moving up in the same way now</text>
  <text start="373.23" dur="4.04">remember in the beginning of the system</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="6.57">back in the 70s we had inflation</text>
  <text start="377.27" dur="7.54">salaries jumped the housing prices</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="5.37">jumped everything moved up because what</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="4.73">was happening is they were creating a</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="6.72">lot of currency as they created currency</text>
  <text start="389.54" dur="6.37">all of a sudden there was inflation the</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="4.52">value of the dollar decreased they were</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="3.99">able to raise the interest rates and</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="4.03">they were able to try it they were able</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="4.41">to control it a little bit in this</text>
  <text start="401.79" dur="4.05">fashion and then came the 80s where</text>
  <text start="404.31" dur="3.15">everything started even out and they</text>
  <text start="405.84" dur="5.16">were able to lower the interest rates a</text>
  <text start="407.46" dur="7.05">little bit which pushed ahead the credit</text>
  <text start="411" dur="6.21">boom and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="414.51" dur="5.04">that people with all this debt they</text>
  <text start="417.21" dur="4.26">can&amp;#39;t go out and they can&amp;#39;t purchase you</text>
  <text start="419.55" dur="5.13">know everyday items it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="421.47" dur="5.4">very very difficult because if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="5.22">have a job where you&amp;#39;re getting cost of</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="5.13">living if you don&amp;#39;t have a job that is</text>
  <text start="429.9" dur="4.77">making more money than you were making</text>
  <text start="432" dur="5.63">before if you have a part-time job or no</text>
  <text start="434.67" dur="6.21">job at all you can&amp;#39;t go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="437.63" dur="6.55">goods like you used to this is why we</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="5.01">see a complete breakdown of the retail</text>
  <text start="444.18" dur="3.739">sector now</text>
  <text start="445.89" dur="5.88">the retail sales they&amp;#39;ve come out and</text>
  <text start="447.919" dur="6.731">thanks to a major downward revision</text>
  <text start="451.77" dur="6.26">they saw July retail sales beat</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="6.239">expectations by 0.5% month a month</text>
  <text start="458.03" dur="7.33">clothing food service and gas station</text>
  <text start="460.889" dur="6.84">sales jumped hmm food service gas</text>
  <text start="465.36" dur="6.39">stations remember the price of fuel went</text>
  <text start="467.729" dur="6.331">up that is included in retail sales so</text>
  <text start="471.75" dur="6">when you strip this away did retail</text>
  <text start="474.06" dur="6.359">sales actually go up actually it really</text>
  <text start="477.75" dur="4.889">didn&amp;#39;t and when you look at this you can</text>
  <text start="480.419" dur="5.4">see that many of the areas they are</text>
  <text start="482.639" dur="6">still having trouble now us industrial</text>
  <text start="485.819" dur="4.651">production rose about 0.1 percent month</text>
  <text start="488.639" dur="4.68">a month in July it missed expectations</text>
  <text start="490.47" dur="6.12">after June&amp;#39;s print was revised higher to</text>
  <text start="493.319" dur="6.451">8 1 % month a month game manufacturing</text>
  <text start="496.59" dur="6.03">production also slowed from 0.8% month a</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="5.85">month in June to 0.3% month a month in</text>
  <text start="502.62" dur="5.549">July and what&amp;#39;s happening here is</text>
  <text start="505.62" dur="5.699">they&amp;#39;re manipulating a lot of this data</text>
  <text start="508.169" dur="5.221">and you see one month you know it beat</text>
  <text start="511.319" dur="3.9">expectations another month it come down</text>
  <text start="513.39" dur="4.41">quite a bit and when you start to look</text>
  <text start="515.219" dur="5.731">at this you can see that what we have</text>
  <text start="517.8" dur="6.9">here is not sustainable because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="520.95" dur="5.97">seeing a lot more down months of US</text>
  <text start="524.7" dur="7.17">production industrial production than we</text>
  <text start="526.92" dur="6.69">have months of upward movement and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.87" dur="3.51">starting to see this around the globe</text>
  <text start="533.61" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re starting to see this everywhere</text>
  <text start="535.38" dur="5.25">where these numbers actually don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="538.92" dur="5.1">sense and all they keep doing is</text>
  <text start="540.63" dur="5.28">revising them manipulating them removing</text>
  <text start="544.02" dur="5.04">things adding things back to make it</text>
  <text start="545.91" dur="5.88">look like everything is working out and</text>
  <text start="549.06" dur="4.49">what is happening here is the economy is</text>
  <text start="551.79" dur="4.26">really breaking down actually the</text>
  <text start="553.55" dur="4.12">statistical numbers don&amp;#39;t even match</text>
  <text start="556.05" dur="4.229">what is really happening in the economy</text>
  <text start="557.67" dur="4.289">I mean I&amp;#39;m getting people writing in</text>
  <text start="560.279" dur="4.171">from all different parts of the country</text>
  <text start="561.959" dur="4.801">even Canada saying that the real estate</text>
  <text start="564.45" dur="5.73">market is just like collapsing in their</text>
  <text start="566.76" dur="5.4">area and they&amp;#39;re saying that stores are</text>
  <text start="570.18" dur="3.81">leaving left and right and malls are</text>
  <text start="572.16" dur="4.86">quite empty that there&amp;#39;s hardly any</text>
  <text start="573.99" dur="6.51">traffic in the stores and no all the</text>
  <text start="577.02" dur="6.629">sales are not going to Amazon but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.5" dur="4.11">very interesting about everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.649" dur="3.721">been happening</text>
  <text start="584.61" dur="5.7">is what is happening with the central</text>
  <text start="587.37" dur="5.339">bank and the banks now we know they</text>
  <text start="590.31" dur="5.519">would love to go to a cashless system</text>
  <text start="592.709" dur="5.37">and we know that they&amp;#39;re very scared of</text>

  <text start="598.079" dur="4.411">to ATMs</text>
  <text start="599.279" dur="4.891">when the system comes down and we know</text>
  <text start="602.49" dur="3.539">that the central bankers sooner or later</text>
  <text start="604.17" dur="3.599">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to bring the system</text>
  <text start="606.029" dur="3.75">down and control the narrative and</text>
  <text start="607.769" dur="3.451">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to do it before Trump</text>
  <text start="609.779" dur="3.211">or the Patriots bring it down where they</text>
  <text start="611.22" dur="5.16">control the narrative so we have that</text>

  <text start="706.25" dur="7.449">machines and to me what this seems like</text>
  <text start="710.49" dur="5.49">is that the central bank the bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="713.699" dur="3.791">are preparing to shut down these</text>
  <text start="715.98" dur="4.959">machines now</text>
  <text start="717.49" dur="4.98">if this does happen and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="720.939" dur="4.111">you hear in the corporate media that you</text>
  <text start="722.47" dur="7.169">you know there&amp;#39;s cyber attacks against</text>
  <text start="725.05" dur="9.149">ATM machines they might make the case of</text>
  <text start="729.639" dur="8.39">why we don&amp;#39;t need ATMs anymore and we</text>
  <text start="734.199" dur="6.42">should go to a cashless society and</text>
  <text start="738.029" dur="5.05">remember we talked about this quite a</text>
  <text start="740.619" dur="5.01">while ago where they were talking about</text>
  <text start="743.079" dur="5.401">getting rid of cash now this is</text>
  <text start="745.629" dur="6.63">different than crypto currencies this is</text>
  <text start="748.48" dur="7.62">the central bank controlling their</text>
  <text start="752.259" dur="6.06">centralized fiat cash now why would they</text>
  <text start="756.1" dur="6.149">want to do this we talked about this</text>
  <text start="758.319" dur="7.101">before when the collapse hits they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="762.249" dur="5.88">want people running to the ATM machines</text>
  <text start="765.42" dur="4.06">they don&amp;#39;t want these machines around</text>
  <text start="768.129" dur="3.24">they don&amp;#39;t want people running to the</text>
  <text start="769.48" dur="4.469">bank&amp;#39;s trying to get cash out actually</text>
  <text start="771.369" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s difficult from many many people</text>
  <text start="773.949" dur="3.721">that have been riding in to get cash out</text>
  <text start="776.259" dur="3.57">and I&amp;#39;m not talking about 200-300</text>
  <text start="777.67" dur="5.129">talking about five thousand ten thousand</text>
  <text start="779.829" dur="5.55">when you go into the banks so if the</text>
  <text start="782.799" dur="5.46">system as we can see it is falling apart</text>
  <text start="785.379" dur="6.51">once it collapses what are people going</text>
  <text start="788.259" dur="5.25">to do they&amp;#39;re going to run to the</text>
  <text start="791.889" dur="3.39">banking system they&amp;#39;re gonna run to the</text>
  <text start="793.509" dur="3.69">ATMs are gonna run to the banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="795.279" dur="3.36">gonna try to get cash out well if you</text>
  <text start="797.199" dur="3.42">run to the banks inside where the</text>
  <text start="798.639" dur="3.961">tellers are it&amp;#39;s very easy for them to</text>
  <text start="800.619" dur="3.84">say listen you&amp;#39;re not taking the cash</text>
  <text start="802.6" dur="6.5">out ATMs</text>
  <text start="804.459" dur="6.99">well you got to get rid of them because</text>
  <text start="809.1" dur="4.51">beforehand when people hear things are</text>
  <text start="811.449" dur="4.23">happening people are gonna run to them</text>
  <text start="813.61" dur="4.079">yes you can electronically shut them</text>
  <text start="815.679" dur="4.741">down but you would have to do this to</text>
  <text start="817.689" dur="4.671">every single machine to move us into a</text>
  <text start="820.42" dur="4.74">cashless society</text>
  <text start="822.36" dur="4.899">you start getting rid of everything</text>
  <text start="825.16" dur="4.95">where people have access to that has to</text>
  <text start="827.259" dur="5.031">do with cash and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="830.11" dur="6">what the central bankers are up to and</text>
  <text start="832.29" dur="6.399">with this story about the FBI warning of</text>
  <text start="836.11" dur="6.269">a cyberattack on ATM machines not just</text>
  <text start="838.689" dur="6.45">here in the US but globally well it</text>
  <text start="842.379" dur="5.04">tells us that they are pushing a certain</text>
  <text start="845.139" dur="6.031">agenda because it&amp;#39;s very odd that</text>
  <text start="847.419" dur="9.301">they&amp;#39;re shutting down many many ATMs and</text>
  <text start="851.17" dur="7.469">UK and Spain in many countries and all</text>
  <text start="856.72" dur="4.08">of a sudden we&amp;#39;re getting a warning of a</text>
  <text start="858.639" dur="4.591">cyberattack so the central bankers it</text>
  <text start="860.8" dur="5.159">looks like they&amp;#39;re preparing and trying</text>
  <text start="863.23" dur="5.64">to move us away from cash into their</text>
  <text start="865.959" dur="4.261">digital fiat system and again this is</text>
  <text start="868.87" dur="4.079">different than cryptocurrency where</text>
  <text start="870.22" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s a digital currency completely</text>
  <text start="872.949" dur="3.841">different because the central bank&amp;#39;s do</text>
  <text start="874.36" dur="6.029">not control that they do control this</text>
  <text start="876.79" dur="6.96">and it&amp;#39;s centralized we know it makes it</text>
  <text start="880.389" dur="6.211">easier for them to control a digital</text>
  <text start="883.75" dur="5.699">currency than people have in cash so if</text>
  <text start="886.6" dur="6">the system comes down it&amp;#39;s very easy for</text>
  <text start="889.449" dur="6.75">them to lock everyone out of the entire</text>
  <text start="892.6" dur="5.64">system if it&amp;#39;s all digital and you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="896.199" dur="4.651">do anything with it so it looks like</text>
  <text start="898.24" dur="5.67">this could be one of their final moves</text>
  <text start="900.85" dur="6.9">before they push forward with their</text>
  <text start="903.91" dur="5.489">agenda so everyone needs to be prepared</text>
  <text start="907.75" dur="4.13">and ready for what is coming because</text>
  <text start="909.399" dur="4.711">we&amp;#39;re getting a lot of strange</text>
  <text start="911.88" dur="4.42">information coming out of the central</text>
  <text start="914.11" dur="4.919">bank out of the banking system out of</text>
  <text start="916.3" dur="5.099">the IMF letting us know that this system</text>
  <text start="919.029" dur="4.471">can&amp;#39;t continue on the way it is and</text>
  <text start="921.399" dur="4.62">certain things need to happen and we</text>
  <text start="923.5" dur="3.81">know that they never expected it to go</text>
  <text start="926.019" dur="3.901">this long because they thought they were</text>
  <text start="927.31" dur="4.32">going to have some type of an event so</text>
  <text start="929.92" dur="2.82">we see that things are definitely</text>
  <text start="931.63" dur="4.44">happening right now</text>
  <text start="932.74" dur="7.56">and like I&amp;#39;ve said before be prepared</text>
  <text start="936.07" dur="6.42">have cash on hand have supplies because</text>
  <text start="940.3" dur="5.099">we will be going through a transition</text>
  <text start="942.49" dur="5.61">one way or another to get out of this</text>
  <text start="945.399" dur="5.401">central banking system listen everyone</text>
