  <text start="53.31" dur="5.37">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the</text>
  <text start="56.55" dur="5.31">x22 report my name is Damon this is</text>
  <text start="58.68" dur="5.97">episode 1372 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.86" dur="5.7">September 6 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.65" dur="6.42">episode is it begins central bank shake</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="5.28">up and the control of the Fed let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.07" dur="4.65">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.84" dur="4.17">news now as we know the economy not just</text>
  <text start="75.72" dur="4.08">here in the United States but in many</text>
  <text start="77.01" dur="6.69">different areas people are struggling</text>
  <text start="79.8" dur="6.21">every single day and out in Canada there</text>
  <text start="83.7" dur="3.9">was a report showing that Canadian</text>
  <text start="86.01" dur="3.75">employees they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;re living</text>
  <text start="87.6" dur="3.87">paycheck to paycheck and the report says</text>
  <text start="89.76" dur="3.3">that more than third of those polled</text>
  <text start="91.47" dur="4.77">said that they feel overwhelmed by debt</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="5.85">levels nearly half of workers are living</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="6.03">paycheck to paycheck due to soaring</text>
  <text start="98.91" dur="6.12">spending and debt levels and basically</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="5.52">what they said is if their paycheck is a</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="5.97">little bit late guess what they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="107.79" dur="5.76">survive and the poll found 47 percent of</text>
  <text start="111" dur="3.69">respondents said it would be very very</text>
  <text start="113.55" dur="3.929">difficult to meet their financial</text>
  <text start="114.69" dur="6.12">obligations if their paychecks were</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="4.95">delayed by even a week and this is</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="4.14">happening here in the United States and</text>
  <text start="122.429" dur="5.521">across Europe it&amp;#39;s not just happening in</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="4.47">one area there are many many individuals</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="4.56">and we can see why this is all happening</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="5.67">because the global economy is ripping</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="4.02">itself apart and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="135.09" dur="3.51">and as we look at all the different</text>
  <text start="136.53" dur="3.81">economic indicators that each one of</text>
  <text start="138.6" dur="5.4">these economic indicators they are</text>
  <text start="140.34" dur="6.45">deteriorating very very quickly now for</text>
  <text start="144" dur="5.34">example up in Canada still we know that</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="5.37">the housing market is booming and the</text>
  <text start="149.34" dur="4.86">housing bubble is just whoa out of this</text>
  <text start="152.16" dur="3.42">world right now same thing happening in</text>
  <text start="154.2" dur="3.39">the United States especially in the 20</text>
  <text start="155.58" dur="3.66">cities that Case Shiller reports on</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="3.3">these are the cities that the Fed was</text>
  <text start="159.24" dur="5.73">able to blow up the bubbles once again</text>
  <text start="160.89" dur="7.59">and in Canada what we are seeing right</text>
  <text start="164.97" dur="6.21">now is well it looks like the bubble is</text>
  <text start="168.48" dur="4.62">starting to deflate it&amp;#39;s starting to pop</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="4.83">because what we are seeing in the</text>
  <text start="173.1" dur="5.43">Greater Toronto Area this is the largest</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="5.49">housing market in Canada well it plunged</text>
  <text start="178.53" dur="6.87">by thirty four point eight percent in</text>
  <text start="181.5" dur="5.11">August compared to a year ago and what</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="3.97">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="186.61" dur="6.84">is that detached homes they have dropped</text>
  <text start="189.37" dur="8.7">by negative 41.6% semi-detached homes</text>
  <text start="193.45" dur="9.86">fell by negative 37.3% townhouses fell</text>
  <text start="198.07" dur="9.96">by negative 27.5% condos fell by 28% and</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="6.76">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that even the total</text>
  <text start="208.03" dur="4.56">sales they have plunged a number of</text>
  <text start="210.07" dur="6.24">active listings of homes for sale soared</text>
  <text start="212.59" dur="5.7">by 65 percent year-over-year and those</text>
  <text start="216.31" dur="3.899">people who are trying to sell their</text>
  <text start="218.29" dur="4.38">homes they&amp;#39;re having a very difficult</text>
  <text start="220.209" dur="6.53">time and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the prices</text>
  <text start="222.67" dur="6.33">well they have plunged by 20%</text>
  <text start="226.739" dur="5.411">basically what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="229" dur="8.7">that the housing market in Toronto has</text>
  <text start="232.15" dur="7.74">entered a bear market and this is not</text>
  <text start="237.7" dur="3.48">just going to happen in Canada it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.89" dur="4.29">gonna happen throughout the United</text>
  <text start="241.18" dur="5.46">States in Europe Australia because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="5.19">all working with the same exact system</text>
  <text start="246.64" dur="5.159">that debt levels are too high people</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="5.19">aren&amp;#39;t making enough money the housing</text>
  <text start="251.799" dur="4.741">prices are skyrocketing because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="254.56" dur="3.899">created all these bubbles and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="256.54" dur="3.87">seeing right now is everything starting</text>
  <text start="258.459" dur="3.541">to fall apart and if you really look at</text>
  <text start="260.41" dur="2.819">all the economic indicators and all the</text>
  <text start="262" dur="2.88">different sectors we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="263.229" dur="4.201">that things are rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="264.88" dur="4.2">very very quickly now we know the</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="3.78">central bank they were out there and</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="5.22">they were saying listen we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="5.58">shrink our balance sheet and of course</text>
  <text start="274.3" dur="5.64">through the corporate media making these</text>
  <text start="276.79" dur="5.31">announcements they said that it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="5.46">to begin they&amp;#39;re gonna start selling off</text>
  <text start="282.1" dur="5.31">a lot of their assets but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="285.4" dur="5.67">interesting about all this is that the</text>
  <text start="287.41" dur="6.69">central bank balance sheet it&amp;#39;s about to</text>
  <text start="291.07" dur="5.43">hit 20 trillion dollars actually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.1" dur="3.6">continually moving up and up and up and</text>
  <text start="296.5" dur="2.79">I know they&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="297.7" dur="5.61">shrinking it but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="299.29" dur="5.7">now is they are basically in a gigantic</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="6.12">bubble themselves if you really look at</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="6.12">it and they keep adding to their balance</text>
  <text start="309.43" dur="4.32">sheet because what are they doing they</text>
  <text start="311.11" dur="6.33">are buying bonds they are buying toxic</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="5.4">real estate the mortgages and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="2.88">seeing right now is that it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="319.15" dur="3.6">worse its own</text>
  <text start="320.32" dur="5.1">going up and when the next crisis hits</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="6.06">guess what the central banks will unveil</text>
  <text start="325.42" dur="6.45">truly nuclear levels of QE and money</text>
  <text start="328.81" dur="4.79">printing because this is all they have</text>
  <text start="331.87" dur="5.19">left they have nothing else left to do</text>
  <text start="333.6" dur="5.2">now we see this huge shake-up in the</text>
  <text start="337.06" dur="2.94">central bank Stanley Fisher the</text>
  <text start="338.8" dur="3.69">number-two official at the Federal</text>
  <text start="340" dur="4.5">Reserve well he submitted his</text>
  <text start="342.49" dur="2.79">resignation on Wednesday citing personal</text>
  <text start="344.5" dur="3.09">reasons</text>
  <text start="345.28" dur="6.27">and what we&amp;#39;re starting to see is that</text>
  <text start="347.59" dur="6.11">these individuals in the central bank in</text>
  <text start="351.55" dur="4.77">government they&amp;#39;re gonna jump ship</text>
  <text start="353.7" dur="5.5">they&amp;#39;re gonna start to resign they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="356.32" dur="5.88">gonna start to leave and we can see that</text>
  <text start="359.2" dur="5.43">if this does happen and it is happening</text>
  <text start="362.2" dur="4.02">right now this is a chance to take</text>
  <text start="364.63" dur="4.26">control of the central bank system</text>
  <text start="366.22" dur="5.13">actually Trump could take control of the</text>
  <text start="368.89" dur="4.35">central bank system and actually maybe</text>
  <text start="371.35" dur="4.08">dissolve it I think that would be the</text>
  <text start="373.24" dur="4.53">best course of action will he do it we</text>
  <text start="375.43" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t know right now so we could see</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="4.23">right now that this is all moving</text>
  <text start="379.57" dur="4.29">forward right now and we see at this</text>
  <text start="382" dur="3.78">point that there might be more</text>
  <text start="383.86" dur="3.57">individuals that resigned now remember</text>
  <text start="385.78" dur="2.46">these individuals they were appointed by</text>
  <text start="387.43" dur="3.42">Obama</text>
  <text start="388.24" dur="3.99">so right now Trump faces a major task</text>
  <text start="390.85" dur="4.23">and choosing the next chairman of the</text>
  <text start="392.23" dur="4.44">Fed before February and replacing most</text>
  <text start="395.08" dur="4.68">of the central bank&amp;#39;s Board of Governors</text>
  <text start="396.67" dur="5.99">now one Fed Walker called it the biggest</text>
  <text start="399.76" dur="9.03">overhaul of the feds leadership since</text>
  <text start="402.66" dur="9.7">1936 I would rather see him dissolve the</text>
  <text start="408.79" dur="6.12">Federal Reserve take control of who</text>
  <text start="412.36" dur="5.66">creates the currency there is no reason</text>
  <text start="414.91" dur="6.09">to have the central banking system and</text>
  <text start="418.02" dur="4.96">we could see that Putin he decided to</text>
  <text start="421" dur="3.87">take control of their central bank and</text>
  <text start="422.98" dur="3.78">this is why the central bankers are very</text>
  <text start="424.87" dur="4.71">angry with Putin because he&amp;#39;s taking</text>
  <text start="426.76" dur="5.25">control of it this might be the first</text>
  <text start="429.58" dur="6.27">step where Trump takes control of the</text>
  <text start="432.01" dur="5.85">central bank and detaches it from the</text>
  <text start="435.85" dur="3.51">private western central bank system and</text>
  <text start="437.86" dur="3.27">the United States government takes</text>
  <text start="439.36" dur="4.71">control and then eventually can dissolve</text>
  <text start="441.13" dur="6.3">it will this happen we don&amp;#39;t know right</text>
  <text start="444.07" dur="7.95">now but this is a very good opportunity</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="6.57">to do this now we also see that doja</text>
  <text start="452.02" dur="3.78">Bank they are out there</text>
  <text start="454" dur="3.9">they are saying this remember Deutsche</text>
  <text start="455.8" dur="5.37">Bank is the largest commercial bank in</text>
  <text start="457.9" dur="5.91">Germany and they are warning about this</text>
  <text start="461.17" dur="5.79">fallout from cheap money they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="463.81" dur="4.53">that everywhere we look it looks like a</text>
  <text start="466.96" dur="5.15">bubble we&amp;#39;re seeing bubbles everywhere</text>
  <text start="468.34" dur="6.62">and we&amp;#39;re getting very nervous now the</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="5.59">chief executive officer John crime</text>
  <text start="474.96" dur="4.24">called for an end to the error of cheap</text>
  <text start="477.7" dur="3.57">money in Europe saying that the</text>
  <text start="479.2" dur="4.5">prolonged period of rock-bottom interest</text>
  <text start="481.27" dur="3.87">rates is starting to inflate asset</text>
  <text start="483.7" dur="3.96">bubbles and putting the bank at a</text>
  <text start="485.14" dur="5.04">disadvantage to us rivals well of course</text>
  <text start="487.66" dur="3.78">this is what&amp;#39;s happening and what</text>
  <text start="490.18" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re saying is that we are seeing</text>
  <text start="491.44" dur="5.49">signs of bubbles in more and more parts</text>
  <text start="494.59" dur="4.02">of the capital market where we wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="496.93" dur="4.5">want to where we wouldn&amp;#39;t have expected</text>
  <text start="498.61" dur="4.08">them he said adding that the interest</text>
  <text start="501.43" dur="3.9">rate policy has been partly responsible</text>
  <text start="502.69" dur="5.55">for the decline in earnings at European</text>
  <text start="505.33" dur="5.7">banks what the central banks have done</text>
  <text start="508.24" dur="4.41">they have basically made the situation a</text>
  <text start="511.03" dur="4.62">lot worse they haven&amp;#39;t made it a lot</text>
  <text start="512.65" dur="5.639">better at all actually what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="515.65" dur="6.06">is they have propped up the banks with</text>
  <text start="518.289" dur="5.391">cheap money they&amp;#39;ve created all these</text>
  <text start="521.71" dur="4.77">bubbles all over the place and</text>
  <text start="523.68" dur="5.71">everyone&amp;#39;s starting to realize that if</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="5.609">the central banks cut off the stimulus I</text>
  <text start="529.39" dur="4.02">know they&amp;#39;re doing it covertly some are</text>
  <text start="532.089" dur="3.111">just doing it right out there and they</text>
  <text start="533.41" dur="6.39">start raising interest rates the whole</text>
  <text start="535.2" dur="6.67">system falls apart and this is why the</text>
  <text start="539.8" dur="3.87">central banks can&amp;#39;t do this I know they</text>
  <text start="541.87" dur="2.969">talk about it a lot I know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543.67" dur="2.13">telling you they&amp;#39;re gonna shrink their</text>
  <text start="544.839" dur="2.401">balance sheet they&amp;#39;re gonna raise</text>
  <text start="545.8" dur="3">interest rates they&amp;#39;re gonna do all</text>
  <text start="547.24" dur="3.15">these things but it is completely</text>
  <text start="548.8" dur="4.65">impossible because if they start doing</text>
  <text start="550.39" dur="5.73">all these things guess what the illusion</text>
  <text start="553.45" dur="7.26">disappears and the whole system falls</text>
  <text start="556.12" dur="7.23">apart so crying urged the ECB that they</text>
  <text start="560.71" dur="4.92">should basically wave goodbye to loose</text>
  <text start="563.35" dur="3.81">monetary policy because while it helped</text>
  <text start="565.63" dur="4.05">the banks the financial markets and</text>
  <text start="567.16" dur="5.04">individual countries emerge from the</text>
  <text start="569.68" dur="7.86">financial crisis it is now causing even</text>
  <text start="572.2" dur="7.62">greater upheaval and this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="577.54" dur="4.56">correct and if they do wave goodbye to</text>
  <text start="579.82" dur="5.25">all of this the whole thing just comes</text>
  <text start="582.1" dur="4.1">crashing down the central banks know</text>
  <text start="585.07" dur="4.4">this</text>
  <text start="586.2" dur="6.72">fed noses this is why they are prepping</text>
  <text start="589.47" dur="5.19">and preparing everything in China and</text>
  <text start="592.92" dur="3">Russia this is why everything&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="594.66" dur="2.97">duplicated this is why everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="595.92" dur="3.12">being moved this is why we see</text>
  <text start="597.63" dur="4.65">everything happening right now this is</text>
  <text start="599.04" dur="5.13">why gold is going up now again the</text>
  <text start="602.28" dur="3.78">central bank&amp;#39;s they might smash it back</text>
  <text start="604.17" dur="5.28">down but gold should be much much higher</text>
  <text start="606.06" dur="7.8">at this point and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="609.45" dur="6.33">as this system comes down as all these</text>
  <text start="613.86" dur="3.27">economic indicators point to one thing</text>
  <text start="615.78" dur="3.99">and one thing only where the entire</text>
  <text start="617.13" dur="4.41">economy is falling apart everyone needs</text>
  <text start="619.77" dur="3.87">to be ready and prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="621.54" dur="4.11">coming this is not going to be something</text>
  <text start="623.64" dur="4.17">where all of a sudden the stock market</text>
  <text start="625.65" dur="4.2">comes down and everything is fun because</text>
  <text start="627.81" dur="3.96">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is that these</text>
  <text start="629.85" dur="5.19">businesses they&amp;#39;re going to use the</text>
  <text start="631.77" dur="5.61">stock market as their excuse when the</text>
  <text start="635.04" dur="4.38">market comes down and maybe we have a</text>
  <text start="637.38" dur="4.11">little correction corporations</text>
  <text start="639.42" dur="3.93">businesses they&amp;#39;re going to use this to</text>
  <text start="641.49" dur="3.63">say this is why we&amp;#39;re laying off people</text>
  <text start="643.35" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re gonna use this to their</text>
  <text start="645.12" dur="4.29">advantage and they&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="648.15" dur="3.45">shutting plants they&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="649.41" dur="3.72">shutting corporations we saw this back</text>
  <text start="651.6" dur="3.27">in 2008 and there&amp;#39;s looking at me a lot</text>
  <text start="653.13" dur="3.51">of companies that go completely out of</text>
  <text start="654.87" dur="3.45">business because a lot what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
