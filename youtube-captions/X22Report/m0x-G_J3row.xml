  <text start="59.44" dur="6.39">gold and a little bit but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="63.07" dur="5.909">looking at right here is the US</text>
  <text start="65.83" dur="8.25">government central bankers their mission</text>
  <text start="68.979" dur="7.021">is to keep this illusion alive up until</text>
  <text start="74.08" dur="4.89">the collapse and throughout the collapse</text>
  <text start="76" dur="6.049">and the only way they the only way they</text>
  <text start="78.97" dur="7.89">can do this is they need to manipulate</text>
  <text start="82.049" dur="6.61">everything to convince the public the</text>
  <text start="86.86" dur="4.71">economy is doing well they did it back</text>
  <text start="88.659" dur="4.621">in 2007 going into 2008 they did it very</text>
  <text start="91.57" dur="5.549">well but since that period of time</text>
  <text start="93.28" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;ve mastered the illusion but when</text>
  <text start="97.119" dur="4.081">we look at these economic indicators we</text>
  <text start="99.46" dur="3.57">see that things are rapidly starting to</text>
  <text start="101.2" dur="4.89">fall apart we know that the unemployment</text>
  <text start="103.03" dur="4.56">numbers they are completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="106.09" dur="4.919">here in the United States we understand</text>
  <text start="107.59" dur="5.19">they manipulate them and Europe is doing</text>
  <text start="111.009" dur="3.03">the same thing as the united states</text>
  <text start="112.78" dur="4.5">where they don&amp;#39;t count those people who</text>
  <text start="114.039" dur="5.131">have fallen off a job market we see the</text>
  <text start="117.28" dur="4.32">eurozone July unemployment rate has</text>
  <text start="119.17" dur="4.979">inched up to 10.1 percent and you have</text>
  <text start="121.6" dur="5.699">to remember this is the manipulated</text>
  <text start="124.149" dur="5.071">number just like the United States is</text>
  <text start="127.299" dur="4.111">telling the world that we are at five</text>
  <text start="129.22" dur="7.98">percent we know these numbers are much</text>
  <text start="131.41" dur="10.38">much worse we see out in Canada now the</text>
  <text start="137.2" dur="6.87">first half of 2015 we saw Canada enter a</text>
  <text start="141.79" dur="5.19">recession with two quarters of negative</text>
  <text start="144.07" dur="6.14">gdp then all of a sudden everything</text>
  <text start="146.98" dur="8.82">bounced back well that dead cat bounce</text>
  <text start="150.21" dur="9.27">it is over the second quarter of 2016</text>
  <text start="155.8" dur="5.82">GDP slumped to one-point-six percent</text>
  <text start="159.48" dur="4.9">double dipping to the worst since the</text>
  <text start="161.62" dur="7.35">second quarter of two thousand nine</text>
  <text start="164.38" dur="6.51">now the problem with this plunge is that</text>
  <text start="168.97" dur="5.64">oil prices actually had their best</text>
  <text start="170.89" dur="8.7">quarter in seven years as the economy</text>
  <text start="174.61" dur="7.53">tanked so we can see when we look at all</text>
  <text start="179.59" dur="5.22">these different countries they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="182.14" dur="4.92">starting to get hit right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="7.14">starting to see GDP go down unemployment</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="9.15">go up housing that bubble is popping and</text>
  <text start="191.95" dur="8.57">we know out in Japan for the last 21</text>
  <text start="196.21" dur="6.72">years their unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="200.52" dur="4.2">continually gets lower and lower and</text>
  <text start="202.93" dur="3.93">lower right now they&amp;#39;re at three percent</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="4.27">and everyone is saying well if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.86" dur="5.22">in this recession and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="208.99" dur="6.42">chugging along here and their economy is</text>
  <text start="212.08" dur="6.72">not that great and the Bank of Japan</text>
  <text start="215.41" dur="4.95">owns most of the stock market how is</text>
  <text start="218.8" dur="4.65">their unemployment rate of three percent</text>
  <text start="220.36" dur="4.86">well there&amp;#39;s a hidden problem in all</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="4.65">this just like the United States where</text>
  <text start="225.22" dur="5.67">their unemployment is a five percent the</text>
  <text start="228.1" dur="6.57">number of men in their prime working</text>
  <text start="230.89" dur="6.45">years are joining the ranks of Japan&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.67" dur="6.27">long-term unemployment and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="237.34" dur="7.14">not counted what&amp;#39;s happening here is we</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="7.4">see manufacturing it is shrinking in</text>
  <text start="244.48" dur="7.04">Japan the number of manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="7.899">dropped to 10.3 million in june from</text>
  <text start="251.52" dur="8.92">11.7 million a decade ago and they are</text>
  <text start="256.239" dur="7.861">becoming a service state like the United</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="6.36">States their health care and welfare</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="6.93">sector added 2.7 million jobs their</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="6.72">manufacturing is declining and we can</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="4.74">see right now they&amp;#39;re heading in the</text>
  <text start="273.52" dur="5.06">same direction as the united states</text>
  <text start="275.77" dur="5.91">where they will no longer manufacture</text>
  <text start="278.58" dur="5.17">now is that day today no but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="281.68" dur="3.93">moving in that direction and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.75" dur="5.4">starting to see that those individuals</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="4.92">who don&amp;#39;t or can&amp;#39;t find jobs it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="6.15">like the United States they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="290.53" dur="7.05">counted they&amp;#39;re off the job market now</text>
  <text start="295.3" dur="4.95">when we look at gold we under</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="6.059">Stan Gold is a problem for the central</text>
  <text start="300.25" dur="6.599">bankers they can&amp;#39;t let gold rise and we</text>
  <text start="303.639" dur="9.171">know they suppress it every chance they</text>
  <text start="306.849" dur="10.29">possibly can get now we saw that someone</text>
  <text start="312.81" dur="7.419">dumped almost five billion of notional</text>
  <text start="317.139" dur="5.4">gold into the futures market to bring</text>
  <text start="320.229" dur="5.101">the price close to thirteen hundred</text>
  <text start="322.539" dur="6.87">dollars an ounce and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="325.33" dur="6.389">this last week and this week actually</text>
  <text start="329.409" dur="5.341">this is a good time for everyone start</text>
  <text start="331.719" dur="6.42">purchasing it&amp;#39;s on sale remember what</text>
  <text start="334.75" dur="5.699">they did back in 2007-2008 with the</text>
  <text start="338.139" dur="3.511">subprime securities where they kept the</text>
  <text start="340.449" dur="3.18">illusion of life even though everyone</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="3.569">was defaulting and he subprime</text>
  <text start="343.629" dur="5.371">securities were worthless they were</text>
  <text start="345.219" dur="8.031">garbage they kept the illusion alive to</text>
  <text start="349" dur="8.639">everyone that these were triple-a</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="5.919">incredible investments look what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.639" dur="3.93">doing to gold right now they need to</text>
  <text start="359.169" dur="4.771">keep that illusion alive by continually</text>
  <text start="361.569" dur="4.38">suppressing gold and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.94" dur="5.43">going to happen just like back in 2008</text>
  <text start="365.949" dur="6.33">it will all fall apart the illusion will</text>
  <text start="369.37" dur="7.53">be ripped away and gold will move up</text>
  <text start="372.279" dur="8.551">once again we see atb came out with</text>
  <text start="376.9" dur="8.609">their job numbers and we can see right</text>
  <text start="380.83" dur="6.72">now that job numbers are manipulated the</text>
  <text start="385.509" dur="7.31">initial jobless claims are rising right</text>
  <text start="387.55" dur="9.78">now ATP is saying that the trend is good</text>
  <text start="392.819" dur="7.991">but jobs shrank and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="397.33" dur="7.32">that construction jobs fell by 2000 no</text>
  <text start="400.81" dur="8.4">manufacturing jobs were created service</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="7.53">jobs well they were added to and we can</text>
  <text start="409.21" dur="9.06">see right now that these type of jobs</text>
  <text start="412.18" dur="10.47">are all low-paying type of jobs and we</text>
  <text start="418.27" dur="7.1">can see that nothing has changed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="422.65" dur="5.04">continually manipulating all of this and</text>
  <text start="425.37" dur="5.74">there are no manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="427.69" dur="9.53">construction jobs are dropping</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="9.87">adding bartenders waitresses servers and</text>
  <text start="437.22" dur="6.16">all of this is happening as we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="440.98" dur="6.21">this incredible recovery of an economy</text>
  <text start="443.38" dur="6.69">and we can see right now this is not a</text>
  <text start="447.19" dur="5.64">recovery this is a collapse of the</text>
  <text start="450.07" dur="4.14">system now since all these jobs are</text>
  <text start="452.83" dur="4.14">being created they&amp;#39;re telling us how</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="5.46">great it is we would think that retail</text>
  <text start="456.97" dur="4.53">would expand stores would open more</text>
  <text start="459.67" dur="4.98">people will be shopping online online</text>
  <text start="461.5" dur="6.27">would be booming we&amp;#39;re not seeing this</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="6.09">actually eight hundred and twelve</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="8.69">thousand cable subscribers well they</text>
  <text start="470.74" dur="8.79">decided to cut their services why</text>
  <text start="476.46" dur="7.57">because they don&amp;#39;t have the funds to pay</text>
  <text start="479.53" dur="7.71">for it so right now we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="484.03" dur="5.64">there&amp;#39;s 1.4 million fewer paid pay-tv</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="6.75">subscribers in the second quarter of</text>
  <text start="489.67" dur="6.99">2016 compared to 2015 and no they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="7.65">moving over to other systems they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.66" dur="7.55">saying we can do without we see pending</text>
  <text start="501.64" dur="5.88">home sales well guess what on a</text>
  <text start="504.21" dur="8.019">year-to-year basis pending home sales</text>
  <text start="507.52" dur="7.74">have dropped by 2.2% now they thought it</text>
  <text start="512.229" dur="6.391">was going to rise by 2.2% they were</text>
  <text start="515.26" dur="4.95">completely off now they made many many</text>
  <text start="518.62" dur="4.859">different revisions negative revisions</text>
  <text start="520.21" dur="6.54">and we can see to improve the month on</text>
  <text start="523.479" dur="5.851">month number they revised the</text>
  <text start="526.75" dur="4.61">information and they were able to put</text>
  <text start="529.33" dur="5.76">out there that there was a positive</text>
  <text start="531.36" dur="5.47">month of one-point-three percent but</text>
  <text start="535.09" dur="4.8">when we look at what&amp;#39;s happening from a</text>
  <text start="536.83" dur="6.12">year-to-year basis we are down by</text>
  <text start="539.89" dur="5.07">negative two point two percent all</text>
  <text start="542.95" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re doing is manipulating the data</text>
  <text start="544.96" dur="9.48">to convince you that things are going</text>
  <text start="547.69" dur="10.86">well but guess what they are not we see</text>
  <text start="554.44" dur="6.33">the chicago PMI well we had a dead cat</text>
  <text start="558.55" dur="5.229">bounce once again and we can see right</text>
  <text start="560.77" dur="6.15">now that that</text>
  <text start="563.779" dur="5.821">bounce well it doesn&amp;#39;t exist anymore and</text>
  <text start="566.92" dur="8.339">we can see that they missed expectations</text>
  <text start="569.6" dur="9.75">of 50 point 54.0 9 it came in at 51.5 it</text>
  <text start="575.259" dur="7.541">slowed down in the summer and we can see</text>
  <text start="579.35" dur="7.26">right now that the June jump and the</text>
  <text start="582.8" dur="11.789">July kind of jump all those gains were</text>
  <text start="586.61" dur="10.26">completely erased gone out in Finland we</text>
  <text start="594.589" dur="5.6">see they&amp;#39;re going to do an experiment</text>
  <text start="596.87" dur="6.209">and that experiment is unleashing</text>
  <text start="600.189" dur="5.231">helicopter money so they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="603.079" dur="4.38">randomly select a group of two to three</text>
  <text start="605.42" dur="4.2">thousand citizens already on</text>
  <text start="607.459" dur="4.471">unemployment benefits and they will</text>
  <text start="609.62" dur="5.219">begin to receive a monthly basic income</text>
  <text start="611.93" dur="5.879">of 560 euros which is about 600 600</text>
  <text start="614.839" dur="7.92">dollars the basic income will place</text>
  <text start="617.809" dur="8.21">their existing benefits and they want to</text>
  <text start="622.759" dur="7.83">see how this pilot program does and</text>
  <text start="626.019" dur="7.81">they&amp;#39;re going to run it until 2018 to</text>
  <text start="630.589" dur="6.36">see if helicopter money works will these</text>
  <text start="633.829" dur="8.37">people go out and purchase goods to</text>
  <text start="636.949" dur="7.281">stimulate the economy most likely it</text>
  <text start="642.199" dur="7.771">will not because we know from the past</text>
  <text start="644.23" dur="7.51">this does not work people save it</text>
  <text start="649.97" dur="3.809">because they don&amp;#39;t know when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="651.74" dur="4.019">going to receive another check like this</text>
  <text start="653.779" dur="7.35">they&amp;#39;re not just going to run out and</text>
  <text start="655.759" dur="7.08">purchase goods like crazy and most of</text>
  <text start="661.129" dur="4.08">the time the helicopter money is not</text>
  <text start="662.839" dur="4.29">even enough to say hey I can pay for my</text>
  <text start="665.209" dur="5.341">rent my electric and everything else and</text>
  <text start="667.129" dur="8.101">go out and purchase goods so this</text>
  <text start="670.55" dur="6.269">experiment most likely will fail we see</text>
  <text start="675.23" dur="4.169">that the International Bank of</text>
  <text start="676.819" dur="4.231">Reconstruction and Development one of</text>
  <text start="679.399" dur="5.16">the five member institutions of the</text>
