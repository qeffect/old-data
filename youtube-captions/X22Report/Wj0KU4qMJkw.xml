  <text start="435.09" dur="7.5">were a globalist society controlled by</text>
  <text start="439.08" dur="6.87">the central bankers they had everything</text>
  <text start="442.59" dur="5.73">in place they had everything the way</text>

  <text start="452.79" dur="4.08">have an event to explain away the</text>
  <text start="454.68" dur="5.48">collapse so when they were able to</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="7.47">restart the system they be able to</text>
  <text start="460.16" dur="7.6">restart it globally that whole plan is</text>
  <text start="464.34" dur="7.89">falling apart that whole plan doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="9.48">exist anymore and now we have Trump</text>
  <text start="472.23" dur="7.23">pointing at the Fed every single time he</text>

  <text start="496.41" dur="6.21">best interest of this country and</text>
  <text start="498.41" dur="6.85">compared it to a country that spy that</text>
  <text start="502.62" dur="5.13">cheats and does all these other things</text>
  <text start="505.26" dur="4.68">think about that for a second he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.75" dur="4.05">comparing them to China</text>
  <text start="509.94" dur="5.84">actually they&amp;#39;re much worse than China</text>
  <text start="511.8" dur="3.98">but who do you compare them to</text>
