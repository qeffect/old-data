  <text start="192.43" dur="10.47">retail real estate the automobile</text>
  <text start="197.109" dur="7.53">industry is all going to suffer and this</text>
  <text start="202.9" dur="4.05">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing in each one of</text>
  <text start="204.639" dur="4.47">these countries there is no economic</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="5.399">growth whatsoever you know what there is</text>
  <text start="209.109" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s growth in debt and of course</text>
  <text start="212.349" dur="3.09">when the central bankers tell us there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.359" dur="3.78">growth that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="215.439" dur="6.541">ah that debt has grown the country is</text>
  <text start="218.139" dur="6.121">doing fantastic but no that is not real</text>
  <text start="221.98" dur="6.05">economic growth they told us for years</text>
  <text start="224.26" dur="8.009">upon years upon years that Greece is</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="7.139">doing well they see economic growth all</text>
  <text start="232.269" dur="9.381">they saw and all they reported on was</text>
  <text start="235.169" dur="10.021">the increasing of debt on the people</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="8.53">because that&amp;#39;s what central bankers want</text>
  <text start="245.19" dur="8.56">their product is debt they make their</text>
  <text start="250.18" dur="6.57">money on pushing debt out countries</text>
  <text start="253.75" dur="5.159">that&amp;#39;s the purpose of the central bank</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="6.33">the purpose of the central bank is not</text>
  <text start="258.909" dur="7.32">for the people it&amp;#39;s to enslave each one</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="6.63">of these countries and it so happens</text>
  <text start="266.229" dur="5.791">that most of the countries are enslaved</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="6.38">to the central bank and this is what we</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="7.889">need to break free of we see Greece is</text>
  <text start="276.09" dur="6.43">continually trying to figure out some</text>
  <text start="279.909" dur="4.681">way to get out of the situation they are</text>
  <text start="282.52" dur="4.29">in and it seems like they are</text>
  <text start="284.59" dur="4.74">continually leaning towards the bricks</text>
  <text start="286.81" dur="5.7">and Russia I mean Greece plans to sign a</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="5.43">memorandum on the political support of</text>
  <text start="292.51" dur="3.36">the Turkish dream project at st.</text>
  <text start="294.76" dur="5.13">Petersburg internet</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="6.27">economic forum coming up very soon we</text>
  <text start="299.89" dur="6.18">also see that Russia and Greece they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.14" dur="7.53">talking about co manufacturing the</text>
  <text start="306.07" dur="5.22">coalition akov rifles in Greece the</text>
  <text start="309.67" dur="3.36">verbal proposal was made during the</text>
  <text start="311.29" dur="4.05">recent visit of Greek defense minister</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="7.47">in Moscow where he discussed several</text>
  <text start="315.34" dur="8.07">defense issues with the Russian side the</text>
  <text start="320.5" dur="6.45">first time that this proposal was made</text>
  <text start="323.41" dur="5.16">was back in two thousand six when Russia</text>
  <text start="326.95" dur="4.02">has suggested the establishment of</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="6">weapons production factories in Greece</text>
  <text start="330.97" dur="6.24">for exports to third countries however</text>
  <text start="334.57" dur="4.92">there were hurdles that they had to get</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="5.28">over and one of them of course is that</text>
  <text start="339.49" dur="8.58">Greece was part of NATO which they still</text>
  <text start="342.49" dur="8.22">are and the United States right now I</text>
  <text start="348.07" dur="6.39">don&amp;#39;t think Greece really cares what</text>
  <text start="350.71" dur="5.22">NATO or the United States things I think</text>
  <text start="354.46" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re looking at their economy I think</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re looking at their people we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.42" dur="5.93">elected into power and they need to</text>
  <text start="361.81" dur="6.48">follow through which I hope they do</text>
  <text start="364.35" dur="7.27">which I hope they don&amp;#39;t go with the ECB</text>
  <text start="368.29" dur="6.12">/ IMF where they impose austerity on the</text>
  <text start="371.62" dur="5.82">people because the people elected this</text>
  <text start="374.41" dur="6.27">government to get rid of austerity to</text>
  <text start="377.44" dur="5.31">create jobs to spur economic growth not</text>
  <text start="380.68" dur="4.11">to get more debt because if they go with</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="6.5">the deal they&amp;#39;re only going to get more</text>
  <text start="384.79" dur="7.26">dead period and we know right now that</text>
  <text start="389.25" dur="7.21">Greece does not have the funds to make</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="8.7">the next payment so we see that Russia</text>
  <text start="396.46" dur="7.08">is extending its hand to Greece we see</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="8.27">the bricks is extending their hand to</text>
  <text start="403.54" dur="9.15">Greece and the ECB IMF will not budge on</text>
  <text start="409.02" dur="7.33">pensions on austerity or anything like</text>
  <text start="412.69" dur="8.88">that whatsoever Goldman Sachs is out</text>
  <text start="416.35" dur="10.2">there saying Greece might need to change</text>
  <text start="421.57" dur="7.77">its government it might be necessary to</text>
  <text start="426.55" dur="5.19">do this to reach a deal with</text>
  <text start="429.34" dur="5.49">ECB IMF because this new government is</text>
  <text start="431.74" dur="6.3">not cooperating like the older</text>
  <text start="434.83" dur="5.04">government of Greece just saying yes we</text>
  <text start="438.04" dur="4.86">will take on new debt and a lot of this</text>
  <text start="439.87" dur="7.769">debt is odious debt where it was created</text>
  <text start="442.9" dur="7.65">in fraud with Goldman Sachs so we can</text>
  <text start="447.639" dur="6.961">see right now they&amp;#39;re pushing this</text>
  <text start="450.55" dur="6.75">forward we might see something occur in</text>
  <text start="454.6" dur="4.53">Greece we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch a</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="4.5">situation very closely because we see a</text>
  <text start="459.13" dur="4.89">color of revolution occurring now in</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="4.23">Macedonia and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="464.02" dur="3.93">Greece decides to say you know something</text>
  <text start="466.03" dur="3.359">we&amp;#39;re going to default we&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="467.95" dur="3.9">with Russia but the brick system</text>
  <text start="469.389" dur="4.921">whatever they decide to do this is going</text>
  <text start="471.85" dur="4.14">to create a huge problem for the</text>
  <text start="474.31" dur="4.32">eurozone we&amp;#39;re going to see other</text>
  <text start="475.99" dur="4.26">countries looking at this con hmm maybe</text>
  <text start="478.63" dur="6.77">we should do something we might see</text>
  <text start="480.25" dur="7.65">something being created inside Greece to</text>
  <text start="485.4" dur="4.12">maybe replace this government it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.9" dur="3.21">strange that they would even mention</text>
  <text start="489.52" dur="4.14">something like this at this point in</text>
  <text start="491.11" dur="6.66">time so we&amp;#39;ll have to watch this very</text>
  <text start="493.66" dur="7.77">very carefully we see here in the united</text>
  <text start="497.77" dur="6.3">states that the American people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="501.43" dur="5.52">just tapped out they just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="504.07" dur="7.59">funds and of course everyone&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="506.95" dur="9.62">about oh the the income&amp;#39;s around the</text>
  <text start="511.66" dur="7.11">u.s. increased by point four percent</text>
  <text start="516.57" dur="4.87">well if you make in fifteen dollars an</text>
  <text start="518.77" dur="3.81">hour so what is point four percent if</text>
  <text start="521.44" dur="3.39">you&amp;#39;re making twenty dollars an hour</text>
  <text start="522.58" dur="4.41">what is point four percent it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="524.83" dur="6.449">cost of living actually that&amp;#39;s all it is</text>
  <text start="526.99" dur="6.57">and right now we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="531.279" dur="5.691">the American people they&amp;#39;re not spending</text>
  <text start="533.56" dur="6.69">their money if they get any extra money</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="7.18">they&amp;#39;re holding on to it because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="540.25" dur="5.16">nervous they&amp;#39;re nervous what tomorrow is</text>
  <text start="544.15" dur="3.12">going to bring and they don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="545.41" dur="4.94">it&amp;#39;s going to bring they don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="547.27" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re going to have a job or not I</text>
  <text start="550.35" dur="5.29">mean the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="553.3" dur="4.74">thought oh if we bring down the oil</text>
  <text start="555.64" dur="3.93">prices gas will be cheaper people will</text>
  <text start="558.04" dur="4.77">take that money during the holiday</text>
  <text start="559.57" dur="6.3">season and they&amp;#39;ll just spend like crazy</text>
  <text start="562.81" dur="5.43">no actually what that did was allowed</text>
  <text start="565.87" dur="7.59">people to put food on their table for</text>
  <text start="568.24" dur="8.07">another 10 days that&amp;#39;s it and we know</text>
  <text start="573.46" dur="5.4">that the oil prices that came down was</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="3.9">not just for the US economy was many</text>
  <text start="578.86" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s being used for many different</text>
