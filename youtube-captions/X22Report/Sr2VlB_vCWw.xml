  <text start="108.1" dur="3.75">this and tracking this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="109.72" dur="3.179">now it&amp;#39;s very interesting as everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="111.85" dur="3.45">saying that everything is moving to</text>
  <text start="112.899" dur="4.591">online and we kind of debunked this a</text>
  <text start="115.3" dur="5.429">long time ago and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="117.49" dur="5.31">right now is that the malls well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120.729" dur="5.821">deteriorating at a very very fast pace</text>

  <text start="128.74" dur="5.4">properties they reported earnings and</text>
  <text start="131.26" dur="5.61">shares while they plunged by 26% on</text>
  <text start="134.14" dur="4.26">Friday they had already been dropping</text>
  <text start="136.87" dur="4.47">for years because the brick-and-mortar</text>

  <text start="153.16" dur="6.57">quarters results fell below their</text>
  <text start="156.66" dur="5.829">expectations as their revenues were</text>

  <text start="164.8" dur="5.82">is coming from CEO Steven Lebovitz now</text>

  <text start="173.129" dur="4.271">stores have been closing down left and</text>
  <text start="175.36" dur="4.89">right they&amp;#39;re going bankrupt and there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="193.45" dur="6.03">that douve in the same way they</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="6.03">completely imploded on themselves</text>

  <text start="229.299" dur="3.991">since the end of July of 2016 and it</text>
  <text start="231.879" dur="2.79">goes on and on and on and we can see</text>
  <text start="233.29" dur="4.349">that malls they&amp;#39;re having a very</text>
  <text start="234.669" dur="5.641">difficult time right now and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="237.639" dur="4.111">see a lot more stores closed after this</text>
  <text start="240.31" dur="3.42">holiday season because we could see</text>
  <text start="241.75" dur="3.209">right now according to all really all</text>
  <text start="243.73" dur="2.789">the reports and I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="244.959" dur="3.331">the corporate media and every the</text>
  <text start="246.519" dur="3.42">government and the Fed I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="248.29" dur="3.809">what is really happening out on the</text>
  <text start="249.939" dur="3.63">street with everyday people where they</text>
  <text start="252.099" dur="2.82">are losing their jobs that people in</text>
  <text start="253.569" dur="4.32">retail they&amp;#39;re losing their jobs and</text>
  <text start="254.919" dur="5.461">they can&amp;#39;t find these high-paying jobs I</text>
  <text start="257.889" dur="3">know the unemployment numbers are at 4.1</text>
  <text start="260.38" dur="2.7">percent</text>
  <text start="260.889" dur="3.661">but when you look at the manipulation</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="3.03">you can see how they got this number</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="3.839">down we&amp;#39;ve discussed it many many times</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="3.6">before we know that they don&amp;#39;t count</text>
  <text start="268.389" dur="3.451">those people that haven&amp;#39;t been on an</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="4.199">interview for four weeks a part-time job</text>
  <text start="271.84" dur="3.69">is considered a full-time job and when</text>
  <text start="273.909" dur="3.061">you put all this together you can see</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="2.879">how they can manipulate this and</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="4.11">continually bring the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="278.409" dur="4.741">down and they continually convince</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="4.41">everyone that everything is fantastic</text>
  <text start="283.15" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;ve done this in the past and they</text>
  <text start="285.49" dur="4.019">had a manipulate even further because</text>
  <text start="287.32" dur="5.819">the economy is deteriorating at a very</text>
  <text start="289.509" dur="5.731">very fast pace now we understand this</text>
  <text start="293.139" dur="4.861">debt ceiling charade it&amp;#39;s being played</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="5.37">out every few years in Congress and is</text>
  <text start="298" dur="5.22">being played out right now and what</text>
  <text start="300.61" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that instead</text>
  <text start="303.22" dur="4.86">of raising the debt ceiling Congress</text>
  <text start="305.71" dur="5.91">this time they decided to you know just</text>
  <text start="308.08" dur="6.139">suspend it and they only suspended it</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="5.34">through December 8th after which the</text>
  <text start="314.219" dur="6.161">whole argument about the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="4.2">will start up once again and we know</text>
  <text start="320.38" dur="3.9">that they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="321.16" dur="6.87">until 2018 but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="324.28" dur="6.6">now is that over just the six years that</text>
  <text start="328.03" dur="4.98">debt has ballooned by five point seven</text>
  <text start="330.88" dur="4.41">trillion or thirty nine percent from</text>
  <text start="333.01" dur="5.22">fourteen point eight trillion to 20</text>
  <text start="335.29" dur="6.45">point five trillion the current host</text>
  <text start="338.23" dur="6.42">debt ceiling spike has reached 640</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="5.22">billion and continues to surge so we</text>
  <text start="344.65" dur="5.19">have seen in the last eight weeks the</text>
  <text start="346.96" dur="7.14">debt has spiked by six hundred and forty</text>
  <text start="349.84" dur="6.42">billion dollars that&amp;#39;s a half a more</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="5.58">than half a trillion right now in eight</text>
  <text start="356.26" dur="6.12">weeks and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before if we</text>
  <text start="359.68" dur="4.59">go back in time and we go back to 2013</text>
  <text start="362.38" dur="4.29">when they had the debt ceiling argument</text>
  <text start="364.27" dur="5.01">well they suspended it or whatever they</text>
  <text start="366.67" dur="5.22">did at that time the debt rose by four</text>
  <text start="369.28" dur="4.83">hundred and sixty-four billion in 2015</text>
  <text start="371.89" dur="4.41">the debt ceil that the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="374.11" dur="3.84">argument once again all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="376.3" dur="3.8">had a spike in November of six hundred</text>
  <text start="377.95" dur="6.9">and fifty billion and here we are today</text>
  <text start="380.1" dur="8.2">six hundred and forty billion surge in</text>
  <text start="384.85" dur="6.57">the debt so nothing has gone away</text>
  <text start="388.3" dur="5.43">everything is status quo and the</text>
  <text start="391.42" dur="4.86">government they can&amp;#39;t do anything they</text>
  <text start="393.73" dur="5.4">have to continually borrow money and</text>
  <text start="396.28" dur="5.67">they have to continually fund all these</text>
  <text start="399.13" dur="5.46">entitlement programs and it is getting</text>
  <text start="401.95" dur="6.03">worse and worse as time goes on it is</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="6.27">not improving whatsoever now I know on</text>
  <text start="407.98" dur="5.49">November first the Treasury warned and</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="5.07">they said the following if Congress</text>
  <text start="413.47" dur="5.67">fails to increase or further suspend the</text>
  <text start="415.93" dur="6">debt limit by December eighth as it has</text>
  <text start="419.14" dur="4.74">in the past they can take certain</text>
  <text start="421.93" dur="3.84">extraordinary measures to continue to</text>
  <text start="423.88" dur="5.039">finance the government on a temporary</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="4.8">basis now extraordinary measures will</text>
  <text start="428.919" dur="4.141">allow the government to continue to meet</text>
  <text start="430.57" dur="4.2">its obligations through January 2018 and</text>
  <text start="433.06" dur="4.02">we know they&amp;#39;re going to be used the</text>
  <text start="434.77" dur="3.6">stabilization fund where they have</text>
  <text start="437.08" dur="3.63">trillions and trillions of dollars in</text>
  <text start="438.37" dur="4.26">this fund where they can basically fund</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="4.26">the government for quite a while now</text>
  <text start="442.63" dur="3.9">again this was created out of thin air a</text>
  <text start="444.97" dur="3.9">lot of the money was stolen and put into</text>
  <text start="446.53" dur="3.66">this fund and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="448.87" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re gonna be pushing this all the</text>
  <text start="450.19" dur="3.72">way into January of 2018 but once again</text>
  <text start="452.05" dur="2.88">we have the same exact problem this is</text>
  <text start="453.91" dur="2.61">not going to go away</text>
  <text start="454.93" dur="2.91">and what&amp;#39;s going to happen is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="3.36">gonna raise this debt ceiling because</text>
  <text start="457.84" dur="4.32">they have no alternative and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="459.88" dur="7.11">add more and more debt this will never</text>
  <text start="462.16" dur="7.979">ever end now there was a report which</text>
  <text start="466.99" dur="5.25">was recently published by UPS and they</text>
  <text start="470.139" dur="3.991">wanted to show what has been happening</text>
  <text start="472.24" dur="4.429">around the world especially with the</text>
  <text start="474.13" dur="5.73">wealthy individuals the billionaires and</text>
  <text start="476.669" dur="5.261">what we&amp;#39;re seeing today is that those</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="4.86">individuals they are becoming wealthier</text>
  <text start="481.93" dur="5.88">and wealthier as the eighty to ninety</text>
  <text start="484.72" dur="6.569">percent of the population is actually</text>
  <text start="487.81" dur="5.25">getting poor and poor their wages are</text>
  <text start="491.289" dur="4.291">continuing declining they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="493.06" dur="6.6">their assets and they&amp;#39;re losing their</text>
  <text start="495.58" dur="6.78">jobs and billionaires right now increase</text>
  <text start="499.66" dur="7.5">their combined global wealth by almost a</text>
  <text start="502.36" dur="8.54">fifth last year to a record six trillion</text>
  <text start="507.16" dur="7.98">dollars more than twice the GDP of UK</text>
  <text start="510.9" dur="6.759">there are now 1542 dollar billionaires</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="4.62">across the world after a hundred and</text>
  <text start="517.659" dur="5.07">forty five multimillionaires saw their</text>
  <text start="519.76" dur="6.21">wealth tick over into nine zero fortunes</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="6.121">last year now the UBS billionaires</text>
  <text start="525.97" dur="4.8">report 2017 is an indication that we are</text>
  <text start="528.85" dur="4.92">entering a new and very unique time in</text>
  <text start="530.77" dur="6.48">history not since the Gilded Age of the</text>
  <text start="533.77" dur="5.67">early 1900s have we seen such a dramatic</text>
  <text start="537.25" dur="4.23">rise in the wealth of small handful of</text>
  <text start="539.44" dur="4.14">people this was during the rise of the</text>
  <text start="541.48" dur="4.2">industrial era where a small handful of</text>
  <text start="543.58" dur="4.41">individuals and families they were able</text>
  <text start="545.68" dur="4.62">to reshape the entire culture to work in</text>
  <text start="547.99" dur="4.65">their favor we are seeing the same thing</text>
  <text start="550.3" dur="4.74">happen once again and back then what we</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="4.05">saw was a backlash from the general</text>
  <text start="555.04" dur="4.169">public and I believe we&amp;#39;re gonna most</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="5.13">likely say the same exact thing now the</text>
  <text start="559.209" dur="4.831">government realizes that they have a</text>
  <text start="561.82" dur="4.83">debt problem they realize they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="564.04" dur="5.039">bringing enough bringing in enough funds</text>
  <text start="566.65" dur="3.6">they realize that the tax receipts the</text>
  <text start="569.079" dur="2.76">federal tax receipts that are coming</text>
  <text start="570.25" dur="5.04">into the government they are declining</text>
  <text start="571.839" dur="4.681">and they needed to go out and find more</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="5.669">income and this is why they created</text>
  <text start="576.52" dur="6.63">FATCA and Gatka and faka that allows the</text>
  <text start="580.959" dur="6.061">government to go out around the world</text>
  <text start="583.15" dur="5.429">and say listen you owe us this money no</text>
  <text start="587.02" dur="3.21">matter if your work</text>
  <text start="588.579" dur="4.531">in the United States or not you just owe</text>
  <text start="590.23" dur="5.819">it and it forced the banks and financial</text>
  <text start="593.11" dur="5.039">institutions to report these individuals</text>
  <text start="596.049" dur="4.47">because the government at this point is</text>
  <text start="598.149" dur="4.38">desperate to find as much as they</text>
  <text start="600.519" dur="4.47">possibly can to keep their whole entire</text>
  <text start="602.529" dur="4.23">system funded and this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="604.989" dur="3.6">been doing right now and what has</text>
  <text start="606.759" dur="4.14">happened since this time since they</text>
  <text start="608.589" dur="4.29">passed FATCA those people who are</text>
  <text start="610.899" dur="5.1">renouncing their citizenship that</text>
  <text start="612.879" dur="4.8">continually Rises and it sounds like a</text>
  <text start="615.999" dur="2.94">very small number but it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="617.679" dur="4.5">moving up and up and up</text>
  <text start="618.939" dur="5.52">now the latest list that came out is</text>
  <text start="622.179" dur="4.14">that there&amp;#39;s about one thousand three</text>
  <text start="624.459" dur="4.8">hundred and seventy-six people that are</text>
  <text start="626.319" dur="4.5">renouncing their citizenship now it does</text>
  <text start="629.259" dur="3.601">sound like it&amp;#39;s a small number but the</text>
  <text start="630.819" dur="4.911">total of 2017 is projected to be more</text>
