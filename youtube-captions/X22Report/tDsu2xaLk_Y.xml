  <text start="53.1" dur="7.709">hi and welcome to the x-22 report my</text>
  <text start="57.239" dur="6.631">name is Dave and is episode 1614 bien</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="5.581">today&amp;#39;s date is July 12th 2018 and the</text>
  <text start="63.87" dur="4.68">title the episode is expecting a call</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="4.56">soon enjoy the show</text>
  <text start="68.55" dur="5.52">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="70.95" dur="4.169">political and geopolitical news now it</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="4.29">looks like today</text>
  <text start="75.119" dur="7.89">Peter struck he is testifying in public</text>
  <text start="78.36" dur="7.83">in front of Congress and we understand</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="4.801">that Lisa Paige well she decided that</text>
  <text start="86.19" dur="3.959">she wasn&amp;#39;t going to appear before the</text>
  <text start="87.81" dur="5.729">House Judiciary Committee and Paul Ryan</text>
  <text start="90.149" dur="6.991">right now is saying that he might hold</text>
  <text start="93.539" dur="7.351">her in contempt of Congress now I</text>
  <text start="97.14" dur="7.32">watched some of the questions going back</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="7.259">and forth to Peter struck and I go back</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="6.329">to Q when Q says enjoy the show because</text>
  <text start="108.149" dur="5.071">to me it seemed like a show and it</text>
  <text start="110.789" dur="6.601">seemed like this was gonna go absolutely</text>
  <text start="113.22" dur="7.5">nowhere why because they&amp;#39;re questioning</text>
  <text start="117.39" dur="6">an individual without having all the</text>
  <text start="120.72" dur="6.32">information they only have the</text>
  <text start="123.39" dur="7.47">information that was rewritten</text>
  <text start="127.04" dur="7.36">manipulated and then given to them the</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="8.099">real report which is classified which is</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="8.88">redacted they have not seen and to ask</text>
  <text start="138.959" dur="5.791">someone questions and get answers it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.28" dur="2.85">just not going to happen and the</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="2.43">individual is going to say I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="3.87">to answer that and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="147.18" dur="3.779">been seeing and the debate and the</text>
  <text start="150" dur="4.769">questions</text>
  <text start="150.959" dur="6.631">it was very heated on both sides and the</text>
  <text start="154.769" dur="7.44">whole thing was you know politically</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="7.649">charged and it&amp;#39;s a gigantic show I think</text>
  <text start="162.209" dur="7.921">would be better off if we had the facts</text>
  <text start="165.239" dur="8.161">if we had the real information we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170.13" dur="8.21">have that as of yet so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="7.23">with all of this is one gigantic show</text>
  <text start="178.34" dur="4.41">because it&amp;#39;s gonna go nowhere</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re not gonna get anything out of it</text>
  <text start="182.75" dur="6.92">because what they need is the</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="6.36">real report not the rewritten report by</text>
  <text start="189.67" dur="6.36">Rod Rosenstein not the redacted report</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="5.7">not portions of the report they need the</text>
  <text start="196.03" dur="4.49">whole thing and I saw that they wanted</text>
  <text start="198.64" dur="4.2">you know to release some of the</text>
  <text start="200.52" dur="4.96">testimony behind closed doors with Peter</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="4.59">struck well yes that&amp;#39;s one little piece</text>
  <text start="205.48" dur="3.78">of it let them you know what release it</text>
  <text start="207.43" dur="3.72">but if you&amp;#39;re gonna release that lets</text>
  <text start="209.26" dur="4.68">release everything let&amp;#39;s be completely</text>
  <text start="211.15" dur="5.54">transparent to the American people let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="213.94" dur="5.46">release the IG report unredacted</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="5.74">unclassified let&amp;#39;s get the real truth</text>
  <text start="219.4" dur="5.96">out there not just a little piece not</text>
  <text start="222.43" dur="6.84">just what they want but everything and</text>
  <text start="225.36" dur="8.04">until this happens nothing&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="229.27" dur="8.01">happen so Q has been telling us that</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="6.61">we&amp;#39;re going to see this IG report we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.28" dur="5.16">going to see arrests made we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="240.01" dur="4.65">see the truth come out we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="242.44" dur="6.24">see people reject it we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="244.66" dur="7.47">people very upset well again it is time</text>
  <text start="248.68" dur="5.339">and we went over the timeline where some</text>
  <text start="252.13" dur="5.16">think it&amp;#39;s going to be late July August</text>
  <text start="254.019" dur="7.431">some say it&amp;#39;s going to be September but</text>
  <text start="257.29" dur="7.47">at this point it needs to happen because</text>
  <text start="261.45" dur="8.02">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a clown</text>
  <text start="264.76" dur="9.3">show and it&amp;#39;s absolutely ridiculous so</text>
  <text start="269.47" dur="8.04">let&amp;#39;s wait until we get the real facts</text>
  <text start="274.06" dur="5.19">because the real facts you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="277.51" dur="3.51">scream and yell and argue and things</text>
  <text start="279.25" dur="2.22">like that because of fact as a fact as a</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="3.03">fact</text>
  <text start="281.47" dur="6.18">and the truth you can&amp;#39;t do anything with</text>
  <text start="284.05" dur="5.28">it you can try to hammer at it but guess</text>
  <text start="287.65" dur="4.62">what it&amp;#39;s the truth it will stand up to</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="7.2">anything and that&amp;#39;s the part we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.27" dur="8.22">missing in all of this we see Trump when</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="6.84">he was out with the NATO leaders we see</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="5.61">that he is declaring a victory at the</text>
  <text start="303.37" dur="6.299">NATO meeting and he&amp;#39;s saying that he was</text>
  <text start="306.1" dur="5.46">able to get the NATO members to increase</text>
  <text start="309.669" dur="4.381">the amount that they&amp;#39;re pouring into</text>
  <text start="311.56" dur="6.419">NATO instead of 2% they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="5.19">moving up to 4% we also see that the</text>
  <text start="317.979" dur="2.361">corporate media is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="319.24" dur="3.5">Trump has three</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="4.92">and to leave NATO and he doesn&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="322.74" dur="5.25">Congress to do it and whatnot but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.26" dur="5.76">very interesting is McCrone has come out</text>
  <text start="327.99" dur="4.98">and said listen some news agencies</text>
  <text start="331.02" dur="3.03">reported the u.s. president had</text>
  <text start="332.97" dur="3.06">threatened to pull out of the</text>
  <text start="334.05" dur="4.08">seven-year-old alliance over frustration</text>
  <text start="336.03" dur="3.81">with the member states lack of</text>
  <text start="338.13" dur="5.099">commitment to agree goals including</text>
  <text start="339.84" dur="7.47">spending 2% of GDP on defense macron</text>
  <text start="343.229" dur="6.111">said no direct threat was issued Trump</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="5.55">warned that the US could go it alone if</text>
  <text start="349.34" dur="6.43">others didn&amp;#39;t step up it fell short of a</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="5.4">direct threat to formally withdraw and</text>
  <text start="355.77" dur="6.51">again I think Trump was using this to</text>
  <text start="358.26" dur="5.909">get these NATO members to start to pay</text>
  <text start="362.28" dur="6.09">up instead of having the United States</text>
  <text start="364.169" dur="6.361">pay out for all of them and I think this</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="3.75">was a strategy that he used now all over</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="3.449">the corporate media we see that the</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="4.08">reporting that North Korea officials</text>
  <text start="373.979" dur="4.381">they didn&amp;#39;t show up Thursday at a</text>
  <text start="376.2" dur="4.469">scheduled meeting with US officials to</text>
  <text start="378.36" dur="5.73">discuss their returning the remains of</text>
  <text start="380.669" dur="5.191">American soldiers and instead suggested</text>
  <text start="384.09" dur="4.29">talking with the United Nations military</text>
  <text start="385.86" dur="4.47">leaders about the issue now North Korea</text>
  <text start="388.38" dur="4.56">asked the United Nations command to hold</text>
  <text start="390.33" dur="4.08">general level military talks about</text>
  <text start="392.94" dur="4.199">returning the remains of the American</text>
  <text start="394.41" dur="5.49">troops killed in the Korean War North</text>
  <text start="397.139" dur="5.311">Korea wants a US general to appear at</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="6.21">the table to quickly finalize the</text>
  <text start="402.45" dur="5.61">repatriation issue and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="4.8">meeting has been rescheduled and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="408.06" dur="4.35">going to meet on Sunday and we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="410.91" dur="3.27">how that goes but of course what the</text>
  <text start="412.41" dur="4.47">corporate media is doing is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.18" dur="5.489">out there saying that oh look see North</text>
  <text start="416.88" dur="6.33">Korea they&amp;#39;re not abiding by the deal</text>
  <text start="419.669" dur="5.31">the u.s. is not working with North Korea</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="4.8">anymore it&amp;#39;s slipping away</text>
  <text start="424.979" dur="4.981">we don&amp;#39;t have peace but Trump he tried</text>
  <text start="428.01" dur="4.26">to combat this today by releasing a</text>
  <text start="429.96" dur="5.01">letter from Kim jong-un the letter was</text>
  <text start="432.27" dur="5.79">sent to trump and he tweeted a copy of a</text>
  <text start="434.97" dur="4.35">letter after landing in London and the</text>
  <text start="438.06" dur="4.53">letter went something like this</text>
  <text start="439.32" dur="4.8">your excellency mr. president the</text>
  <text start="442.59" dur="3.299">significant first meeting with your</text>

  <text start="445.889" dur="4.351">we signed together in Singapore 24 days</text>
  <text start="447.69" dur="4.5">ago was indeed the start of a meaningful</text>
  <text start="450.24" dur="3.28">journey I deeply appreciate the</text>
  <text start="452.19" dur="3.25">energetic and</text>
  <text start="453.52" dur="3.81">extraordinary efforts made by your</text>
  <text start="455.44" dur="3.449">excellency mr. president for the</text>
  <text start="457.33" dur="3.149">improvement of relations between the two</text>
  <text start="458.889" dur="3.481">countries and the faithful</text>
  <text start="460.479" dur="4.201">implementation of the joint statement I</text>
  <text start="462.37" dur="4.59">firmly believe that the strong will</text>
  <text start="464.68" dur="4.799">sincere efforts and unique approach of</text>
  <text start="466.96" dur="5.37">myself and your excellency mr. president</text>
  <text start="469.479" dur="6.06">aimed at opening up a new future between</text>
  <text start="472.33" dur="6.6">the DPRK and the US will surely come to</text>
  <text start="475.539" dur="5.34">fruition wishing that the invariable</text>
  <text start="478.93" dur="3.6">trust and confidence in your excellency</text>
  <text start="480.879" dur="3.391">mr. president will be further</text>
  <text start="482.53" dur="4.56">strengthened in the future process of</text>
  <text start="484.27" dur="6.42">taking practical actions I extend my</text>
  <text start="487.09" dur="7.109">conviction that the epoch I&amp;#39;ll progress</text>
  <text start="490.69" dur="5.789">in promoting the DPRK US relations will</text>
  <text start="494.199" dur="5.671">bring our next meeting forward kim</text>
  <text start="496.479" dur="7.021">jeong-hoon and this is kind of confirmed</text>
  <text start="499.87" dur="7.62">by moon jae-in who says that north korea</text>
  <text start="503.5" dur="7.08">us talks on track criticism was a ploy</text>
  <text start="507.49" dur="5.31">and South Korean president moon jae-in</text>
  <text start="510.58" dur="3.72">said on Thursday that North Korea&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.8" dur="3.9">criticism of the United States after</text>
  <text start="514.3" dur="5.01">recent talks on denuclearization was</text>
  <text start="516.7" dur="4.889">part of its strategy and negotiations</text>
  <text start="519.31" dur="5.37">between them are on the right track and</text>
  <text start="521.589" dur="4.231">it looks like everything is going in the</text>
  <text start="524.68" dur="4.56">right direction in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="525.82" dur="5.7">basically took this and tried to spin it</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="4.89">in a way to show that things weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="531.52" dur="4.92">really working out and this is why</text>
  <text start="534.13" dur="4.5">Pompeo and the rest were saying no</text>
  <text start="536.44" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;re absolutely wrong I was there I</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="4.11">know it was said and we see right now</text>
  <text start="540.67" dur="3.18">that things are headed in the right</text>
  <text start="542.74" dur="4.26">direction remember the deep state</text>
  <text start="543.85" dur="4.83">doesn&amp;#39;t want peace they don&amp;#39;t want any</text>
  <text start="547" dur="3.3">of this they&amp;#39;ve been fighting this all</text>
  <text start="548.68" dur="3.93">along and they&amp;#39;re continually fighting</text>
  <text start="550.3" dur="4.83">it and the way they you but the way they</text>
  <text start="552.61" dur="5.7">do this is they use the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="555.13" dur="4.38">as their mouthpiece to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="558.31" dur="3.69">this is the way it&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="559.51" dur="5.639">because if you have you know five ten</text>
  <text start="562" dur="5.01">twenty different mainstream media</text>
  <text start="565.149" dur="3.721">outlets reporting the same thing people</text>
  <text start="567.01" dur="3.569">believe it even though it can completely</text>
  <text start="568.87" dur="3.93">fake phony and false which most the time</text>
  <text start="570.579" dur="4.231">it is they think that if they</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="3.24">continually do this and everyone reports</text>
  <text start="574.81" dur="4.08">on everyone reads from the script</text>
  <text start="576.04" dur="5.489">everyone believes it we see the Islamic</text>
  <text start="578.89" dur="6.66">state they are trying to get out of</text>
  <text start="581.529" dur="5.941">Syria right now and it looks like Iraq</text>
  <text start="585.55" dur="4.14">is expecting</text>
  <text start="587.47" dur="4.08">huge convoy of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="589.69" dur="4.38">militants it looks like they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="591.55" dur="5.85">try to me you know get over the border</text>
  <text start="594.07" dur="5.34">from Syria to Iraq and Iraq is on high</text>
  <text start="597.4" dur="3.72">alert and they&amp;#39;re ready for the Islamic</text>
  <text start="599.41" dur="3.75">state militants to try to cross the</text>
  <text start="601.12" dur="3.36">border and you know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="603.16" dur="3.33">happen they&amp;#39;re gonna hit them hard and</text>
  <text start="604.48" dur="4.92">pretty much that&amp;#39;s gonna be the end of</text>
  <text start="606.49" dur="4.65">that convoy we see right now a senior</text>
  <text start="609.4" dur="5.79">officer saying listen all we need to do</text>
  <text start="611.14" dur="7.14">is get it Lib liberate it Lib and the</text>
  <text start="615.19" dur="4.68">war is over game over for the Islamic</text>
  <text start="618.28" dur="4.11">state and the rest of the paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="619.87" dur="3.9">terrorists and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="622.39" dur="3.84">heading in that direction because they</text>
  <text start="623.77" dur="4.71">can see already that they&amp;#39;re making huge</text>
  <text start="626.23" dur="5.22">gains in the southwestern portion of</text>
  <text start="628.48" dur="4.95">Syria and it Lib is up in the north and</text>
  <text start="631.45" dur="3.27">all they have to do is liberate that and</text>
  <text start="633.43" dur="3.42">I believe they have the forces to do</text>
  <text start="634.72" dur="5.22">this and it&amp;#39;s just a matter of days</text>
  <text start="636.85" dur="5.94">before the whole thing is all done and</text>
  <text start="639.94" dur="3.51">the paid mercenaries they have nowhere</text>
  <text start="642.79" dur="2.76">to go</text>
  <text start="643.45" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re stuck and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="645.55" dur="4.98">trying to escape out of Syria right now</text>
  <text start="648.37" dur="5.28">and a lot of the moderate rebels are</text>
  <text start="650.53" dur="6.27">just surrendering to the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="653.65" dur="5.7">right now now we understand that q told</text>
  <text start="656.8" dur="5.19">us that North Korea was on the agenda to</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="3.66">have peace to get the deep state out of</text>
  <text start="661.99" dur="2.88">North Korea</text>
  <text start="663.01" dur="6.27">and it turned out to be absolutely</text>
  <text start="664.87" dur="6.54">correct after North Korea we heard that</text>
  <text start="669.28" dur="5.7">Iran was next and we can see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="671.41" dur="6.93">huge push now with Iran and we see that</text>
  <text start="674.98" dur="6.3">Trump got the u.s. out of the nuclear</text>
  <text start="678.34" dur="4.62">deal with Iran Iran is scrambling right</text>
  <text start="681.28" dur="3.81">now going to all the European nations</text>
  <text start="682.96" dur="5.25">all the European nations well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.09" dur="6.57">not so fast to pay up and to do what</text>
  <text start="688.21" dur="5.64">Iran wants and we also see there are</text>
  <text start="691.66" dur="4.47">certain protests happening in Iran but</text>
  <text start="693.85" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re really not that big at this</text>
  <text start="696.13" dur="4.41">point but you can see the strategy the</text>
  <text start="698.56" dur="6.84">strategy is to put a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="700.54" dur="10.41">Iran the strategy is to make Iran kneel</text>
  <text start="705.4" dur="7.95">to the will of what Trump wants now we</text>
  <text start="710.95" dur="6.21">saw this happen out in North Korea and</text>
  <text start="713.35" dur="6.24">in the beginning stages we saw Kim</text>
  <text start="717.16" dur="3.96">jong-eun firing the missiles testing</text>
  <text start="719.59" dur="3.9">nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="721.12" dur="3.389">the president saying that you know we</text>
  <text start="723.49" dur="3.539">will destroy you</text>
  <text start="724.509" dur="4.171">our nuclear button is a lot bigger he</text>
  <text start="727.029" dur="4.11">called Kim jong-un a lot of different</text>
  <text start="728.68" dur="5.19">names and then all of a sudden things</text>
  <text start="731.139" dur="5.01">started to change and then we saw peace</text>
  <text start="733.87" dur="5.279">and then we heard of a summit and then</text>
  <text start="736.149" dur="5.281">all of a sudden we had peace we had a</text>
  <text start="739.149" dur="5.971">summit we had denuclearization</text>
  <text start="741.43" dur="8.579">we had North Korea destroy their nuclear</text>
  <text start="745.12" dur="7.649">facility we had Kim Jong moon destroy a</text>
  <text start="750.009" dur="7.05">lot of their missiles and this is</text>
  <text start="752.769" dur="8.61">ongoing it&amp;#39;s still in process it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="757.059" dur="7.26">in the works with Iran we see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="761.379" dur="6.091">lot of pressure on Iran now Trump is</text>
  <text start="764.319" dur="7.2">saying that he expects to receive a call</text>
  <text start="767.47" dur="8.13">from the Iranian officials in the future</text>
  <text start="771.519" dur="7.651">with an offer to alleviate what is</text>
  <text start="775.6" dur="7.049">happening right now now he was saying</text>
  <text start="779.17" dur="7.979">this at a conference during the NATO</text>
  <text start="782.649" dur="6.331">summit in Brussels and Trump said Tehran</text>
  <text start="787.149" dur="4.11">was treating the United States with much</text>
  <text start="788.98" dur="4.68">more respect right now than they did in</text>
  <text start="791.259" dur="3.601">the past and I know they&amp;#39;re having a lot</text>
  <text start="793.66" dur="3.839">of problems and their economy is</text>
  <text start="794.86" dur="3.63">collapsing at a certain point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="797.499" dur="3.44">gonna give me a call</text>
  <text start="798.49" dur="4.649">they&amp;#39;re gonna say let&amp;#39;s make a deal</text>
  <text start="800.939" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re feeling a lot of pain right now</text>
  <text start="803.139" dur="5.101">and I know a lot of people are out there</text>
  <text start="806.679" dur="3.871">and they&amp;#39;re saying that there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="808.24" dur="4.439">be regime change in Iran but this is not</text>
  <text start="810.55" dur="4.199">really Trump&amp;#39;s policy I mean maybe there</text>
  <text start="812.679" dur="4.77">will be but at this point I don&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="814.749" dur="5.221">happening just like with North Korea</text>
  <text start="817.449" dur="5.37">there was no regime change there&amp;#39;s there</text>
  <text start="819.97" dur="5.07">was no invasion do I think there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="822.819" dur="4.7">to be an invasion or something like that</text>
  <text start="825.04" dur="6.839">in Iran no I really don&amp;#39;t think so</text>
  <text start="827.519" dur="7.18">remember Russia and China they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="831.879" dur="7.02">supporting North Korea still supporting</text>
  <text start="834.699" dur="8.55">Iran and for the United States to go in</text>
  <text start="838.899" dur="8.55">and have regime change or to have an</text>
  <text start="843.249" dur="6.84">invasion or to start a war is it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="847.449" dur="5.461">make sense because why would you have</text>
  <text start="850.089" dur="4.791">peace with North Korea and then start a</text>
  <text start="852.91" dur="4.16">war with Iran both</text>
  <text start="854.88" dur="5.94">layers are still hovering in the</text>
  <text start="857.07" dur="6.53">background that is Russia and China so</text>
  <text start="860.82" dur="5.55">it really makes no sense to do that I</text>
  <text start="863.6" dur="6.01">think the strategy here is to put</text>
  <text start="866.37" dur="8.73">pressure on certain individuals within</text>
  <text start="869.61" dur="8.04">the country make them feel it and all of</text>
  <text start="875.1" dur="5.19">a sudden have things change I mean what</text>
  <text start="877.65" dur="5.34">happened in North Korea almost the same</text>
  <text start="880.29" dur="4.53">thing now in the background we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="882.99" dur="3.42">seeing what is happening here we know</text>
  <text start="884.82" dur="3.93">that Russia is involved we know China is</text>
  <text start="886.41" dur="5.37">involved and there&amp;#39;s certain other</text>
  <text start="888.75" dur="6.72">things happening behind the scenes where</text>
  <text start="891.78" dur="7.68">all of a sudden this call will come</text>
  <text start="895.47" dur="8.07">through and we will see changes being</text>
  <text start="899.46" dur="5.51">made with Iran because what is happening</text>
  <text start="903.54" dur="4.56">right now think about it</text>
  <text start="904.97" dur="5.32">Putin is going to meet with Trump now we</text>
  <text start="908.1" dur="5.58">know the deep state doesn&amp;#39;t want this we</text>
  <text start="910.29" dur="4.68">know that this is their worst nightmare</text>
  <text start="913.68" dur="2.91">now of course they already started the</text>
  <text start="914.97" dur="5.61">propaganda saying that Trump is a</text>
  <text start="916.59" dur="7.47">Russian agent he&amp;#39;s a plant he&amp;#39;s meeting</text>
  <text start="920.58" dur="5.91">with Putin to you know get ready to have</text>
  <text start="924.06" dur="3.48">Russia interfere with the next elections</text>
  <text start="926.49" dur="3.66">I mean they&amp;#39;re making up all these</text>
  <text start="927.54" dur="6.03">different things what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="930.15" dur="6.6">here is the deep state their entire</text>
  <text start="933.57" dur="7.95">operation is about to implode on itself</text>
  <text start="936.75" dur="7.05">and already we can see with Israel</text>
  <text start="941.52" dur="6.3">Netanyahu is out there and yes he is</text>
  <text start="943.8" dur="8.61">part of this he&amp;#39;s saying Israel it is</text>
  <text start="947.82" dur="7.89">not seeking to topple Assad at all what</text>
  <text start="952.41" dur="7.26">they want is they want me Iranian forces</text>
  <text start="955.71" dur="7.38">to quit Syria they&amp;#39;d feel a lot more</text>
  <text start="959.67" dur="5.19">comfortable if Iran was completely out</text>
  <text start="963.09" dur="3.24">of Syria doesn&amp;#39;t matter if its troops</text>
  <text start="964.86" dur="4.26">advisers doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference</text>
  <text start="966.33" dur="5.91">Putin already understands this this is</text>
  <text start="969.12" dur="5.46">why he made the call and said listen we</text>
  <text start="972.24" dur="4.22">need all foreign troops out of Syria</text>
  <text start="974.58" dur="5.34">this was the beginning stages of it and</text>
  <text start="976.46" dur="6.34">remember nothing happens overnight they</text>
  <text start="979.92" dur="5.76">do it in stages they release some</text>
  <text start="982.8" dur="5.4">breadcrumbs they put it out there see</text>
  <text start="985.68" dur="2.92">how people react and they continue on</text>
  <text start="988.2" dur="3.04">just</text>
  <text start="988.6" dur="5.219">Trump a couple months ago said the</text>
  <text start="991.24" dur="5.909">troops will be leaving Syria well that</text>
  <text start="993.819" dur="6.601">still holds true and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="997.149" dur="6.92">right now is they&amp;#39;re pushing that plan</text>
  <text start="1000.42" dur="7.62">and they&amp;#39;re pushing the plan with Iran</text>
  <text start="1004.069" dur="6.161">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="1008.04" dur="4.68">plan being played out right in front of</text>
  <text start="1010.23" dur="5.01">us just like North Korea where everyone</text>
  <text start="1012.72" dur="5.099">up to the last minute thought we were</text>
  <text start="1015.24" dur="4.92">going to war actually when we were</text>
  <text start="1017.819" dur="5.07">bombing Syria everyone thought we were</text>
  <text start="1020.16" dur="5.1">going to invade Syria with hundreds of</text>
  <text start="1022.889" dur="4.32">thousands of troops yes this was the</text>
  <text start="1025.26" dur="2.669">deep States dream this is what they</text>
  <text start="1027.209" dur="3.33">always wanted</text>
  <text start="1027.929" dur="4.65">same thing with North Korea it didn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1045.059" dur="7.471">finalize their entire plane and what</text>
  <text start="1048.24" dur="7.64">their strategy is to remove the troops</text>
  <text start="1052.53" dur="6.42">from Syria to give Syria back to Assad</text>
  <text start="1055.88" dur="5.47">to get rid of the rest of the terrorists</text>
  <text start="1058.95" dur="5.04">there and what they&amp;#39;re going to do with</text>
  <text start="1061.35" dur="5.61">Iran we&amp;#39;re gonna see all this play out</text>
