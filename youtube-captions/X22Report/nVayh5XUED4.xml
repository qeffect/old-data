  <text start="30.71" dur="4.98">hi and welcome you listening to the ex</text>
  <text start="34.1" dur="4.56">wanting to report my name is Dave and</text>

  <text start="38.66" dur="5.309">is August 11th 2016 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="41.449" dur="6.451">the episode is us government just went</text>
  <text start="43.969" dur="6.601">into overdrive pushing war let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="47.9" dur="5.579">into the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="50.57" dur="5.04">geopolitical news now out in Germany we</text>
  <text start="53.479" dur="4.381">understand there were many different</text>
  <text start="55.61" dur="6.479">false flags and we knew part of the</text>
  <text start="57.86" dur="7.05">agenda was to create tougher laws for</text>
  <text start="62.089" dur="5.271">the people not for the terrorists and we</text>
  <text start="64.91" dur="4.59">see that Germany&amp;#39;s interior minister</text>
  <text start="67.36" dur="4.84">unveiled a proposal to boost security</text>
  <text start="69.5" dur="6.75">after the recent attacks and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="72.2" dur="5.88">creating new security laws now they went</text>
  <text start="76.25" dur="4.77">on to say that they were going to boost</text>
  <text start="78.08" dur="4.38">security after the attacks including</text>
  <text start="81.02" dur="4.709">making the easier to deport foreigners</text>
  <text start="82.46" dur="6.54">deemed dangerous and stripping dual</text>
  <text start="85.729" dur="6.93">nationals who fight for extremist groups</text>
  <text start="89" dur="5.97">of their German citizenship well first</text>
  <text start="92.659" dur="5.451">of all two-port foreigners deemed</text>
  <text start="94.97" dur="5.07">dangerous what are the criteria for this</text>
  <text start="98.11" dur="4.93">they really don&amp;#39;t list it</text>
  <text start="100.04" dur="4.77">they also said they&amp;#39;ll be creating</text>
  <text start="103.04" dur="3.48">several thousand jobs at federal</text>
  <text start="104.81" dur="3.69">security services over the coming years</text>
  <text start="106.52" dur="5.669">and making promoting terrorism a</text>
  <text start="108.5" dur="5.79">criminal offense well what is promoting</text>
  <text start="112.189" dur="4.671">terrorism actually mean it&amp;#39;s funny how</text>
  <text start="114.29" dur="5.509">they use these vague general terms</text>
  <text start="116.86" dur="6.399">because if you really think about it</text>
  <text start="119.799" dur="5.32">those individuals who talk out against</text>
  <text start="123.259" dur="5.64">the government they can say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="125.119" dur="6.96">terrorists today under the US laws the</text>
  <text start="128.899" dur="4.831">founding fathers would be terrorists and</text>
  <text start="132.079" dur="4.53">we can see that most of the countries</text>
  <text start="133.73" dur="4.289">are going down this path and the reason</text>
  <text start="136.609" dur="3.841">why they&amp;#39;re creating all of these</text>
  <text start="138.019" dur="5.761">draconian laws is because they can use</text>
  <text start="140.45" dur="6.45">them later on to say yes this fits into</text>
  <text start="143.78" dur="5.85">our model you are the terrorists because</text>
  <text start="146.9" dur="5.73">when the people start to rise up when</text>
  <text start="149.63" dur="6.93">the system breaks down they will go</text>
  <text start="152.63" dur="6.419">after those individuals and they want</text>
  <text start="156.56" dur="4.5">the definition to be very broad very</text>
  <text start="159.049" dur="5.071">general so they can fit it to any</text>
  <text start="161.06" dur="5.789">category so they</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="5.07">and use them against their own people</text>
  <text start="166.849" dur="3.36">and this is what each and every one of</text>
  <text start="169.19" dur="4.62">these countries are doing because they</text>
  <text start="170.209" dur="5.571">know exactly what&amp;#39;s happening here this</text>
  <text start="173.81" dur="5.52">doesn&amp;#39;t stop terrorism</text>
  <text start="175.78" dur="7.36">most of the terrorism is created by the</text>
  <text start="179.33" dur="6.06">governments they&amp;#39;re inside jobs to scare</text>
  <text start="183.14" dur="4.05">the people into doing things they</text>
  <text start="185.39" dur="5.879">wouldn&amp;#39;t normally do like give up their</text>
  <text start="187.19" dur="6.9">rights give up their weapons and to be</text>
  <text start="191.269" dur="5.58">controlled and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="194.09" dur="6.539">and we&amp;#39;re looking at this situation</text>
  <text start="196.849" dur="6.901">across Europe the Middle East the</text>
  <text start="200.629" dur="5.881">Pacific and we&amp;#39;re seeing the entire</text>
  <text start="203.75" dur="5.549">situation it&amp;#39;s really ramping up right</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="5.67">now because in the end what they really</text>
  <text start="209.299" dur="4.77">want is to cover up this economic</text>
  <text start="212.18" dur="6.059">collapse and the only way to do that is</text>
  <text start="214.069" dur="6.78">to have some type of an event to start a</text>
  <text start="218.239" dur="6">war and this way they can explain away</text>
  <text start="220.849" dur="6.151">why all of this economic turmoil is</text>
  <text start="224.239" dur="5.761">happening and we&amp;#39;re seeing out in</text>
  <text start="227" dur="5.819">Ukraine well the situation is really</text>
  <text start="230" dur="6.78">heating up right now and this should not</text>
  <text start="232.819" dur="7.081">come as a surprise to anybody we have</text>
  <text start="236.78" dur="4.709">been following this we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>

  <text start="245.629" dur="5.401">bass area probing shelling into the area</text>
  <text start="249.079" dur="6.321">seeing where the weaknesses are what</text>
  <text start="251.03" dur="7.35">they need to improve the United States</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="4.799">UK and other nations have been giving</text>
  <text start="258.38" dur="5.75">non-lethal lethal weapons to Ukraine</text>
  <text start="260.199" dur="6.701">they&amp;#39;ve been training the military and</text>

  <text start="270.53" dur="7.71">frontline zones of the Donetsk area and</text>

  <text start="278.24" dur="6.179">push this war forward we see ukrainian</text>
  <text start="282.02" dur="4.26">President poroshenko ordered the</text>
  <text start="284.419" dur="3.601">country&amp;#39;s foreign ministry to initiate</text>

  <text start="295.36" dur="4.119">special monitoring mission to</text>
  <text start="297.889" dur="3.421">into Crimea now of course Russia is</text>
  <text start="299.479" dur="3.601">gonna say why do we need this we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="301.31" dur="3.479">well Ukraine&amp;#39;s gonna make the case that</text>
  <text start="303.08" dur="4.829">things are getting out of hand</text>
  <text start="304.789" dur="6.9">there&amp;#39;s terrorism there we need to</text>
  <text start="307.909" dur="8.25">monitor what&amp;#39;s going on and we see the</text>
  <text start="311.689" dur="7.41">propaganda already starting in the US</text>
  <text start="316.159" dur="7.021">corporate media in the UK corporate</text>
  <text start="319.099" dur="7.051">media we see headlines like this Ukraine</text>
  <text start="323.18" dur="6.359">says Russia has 40,000 troops amassed in</text>
  <text start="326.15" dur="7.949">Crimea with very bad intentions now we</text>
  <text start="329.539" dur="7.321">saw this back a couple of years ago when</text>
  <text start="334.099" dur="4.111">the coup d&amp;#39;etat was happening they told</text>
  <text start="336.86" dur="3.299">us there were hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="338.21" dur="3.919">soldiers on the border and we have to</text>
  <text start="340.159" dur="5.31">remember back in that time period</text>
  <text start="342.129" dur="6.01">Germany UK the United States Ukraine</text>
  <text start="345.469" dur="4.41">flew over the border of Germany using</text>
  <text start="348.139" dur="5.101">the open sky treaty and they saw</text>
  <text start="349.879" dur="4.59">absolutely nothing an NBC crew drove up</text>
  <text start="353.24" dur="4.049">and down the border of Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="354.469" dur="4.711">Russia they couldn&amp;#39;t find the troops the</text>
  <text start="357.289" dur="6.63">u.s. tried to prove it</text>
  <text start="359.18" dur="7.32">by having these 1970 satellite imagery</text>
  <text start="363.919" dur="4.47">they were black-and-white zoomed out and</text>
  <text start="366.5" dur="3.75">then they use Photoshop to circle things</text>
  <text start="368.389" dur="4.131">and this was a dot that was a dot and</text>
  <text start="370.25" dur="6.599">they labeled it but of course as we know</text>
  <text start="372.52" dur="7.66">the satellite imagery today is color 3d</text>
  <text start="376.849" dur="6.18">and they can zoom in right up to a</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="4.769">license plate and read it so we knew</text>
  <text start="383.029" dur="4.29">that that was completely fake and phony</text>
  <text start="384.949" dur="4.261">the other photos they tried to use we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="387.319" dur="5.31">back in 2009 where they showed a tank</text>
  <text start="389.21" dur="5.79">convoy coming into Ukraine and you can</text>
  <text start="392.629" dur="5.16">do a very quick search on Google just go</text>
  <text start="395" dur="4.71">to images take the URL of the image and</text>
  <text start="397.789" dur="4.53">you can find all the images and the</text>
  <text start="399.71" dur="4.47">dates from the original image and when</text>
  <text start="402.319" dur="5.16">it was produced and you can say okay</text>
  <text start="404.18" dur="6.69">this picture is from 2009 this picture</text>
  <text start="407.479" dur="8.521">is from 2005 and they&amp;#39;re just recycling</text>
  <text start="410.87" dur="6.99">it so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="416" dur="7.56">United States government orchestrating</text>
  <text start="417.86" dur="10.849">this entire thing poroshenko well he is</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="8.04">putting all units on combat-ready alert</text>
  <text start="428.709" dur="5.671">he&amp;#39;s brought a huge number</text>
  <text start="431.6" dur="5.25">of troops up to the border of Crimea and</text>
  <text start="434.38" dur="7.51">up to the border of Donetsk and Lugansk</text>
  <text start="436.85" dur="8.88">and they&amp;#39;re just waiting for the right</text>
  <text start="441.89" dur="6.06">time to go to war here now of course</text>
  <text start="445.73" dur="5.28">they do not want it to look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.95" dur="6.81">coming from Ukraine this is why they</text>
  <text start="451.01" dur="5.34">went into Crimea to try to destroy the</text>
  <text start="454.76" dur="5.13">area pretend they were terrorists in</text>
  <text start="456.35" dur="5.55">there hoping that Russia would retaliate</text>
  <text start="459.89" dur="4.77">but we have to watch the actions of</text>
  <text start="461.9" dur="5.19">Russia Russia is not going to start a</text>
  <text start="464.66" dur="5.85">war they&amp;#39;re not gonna fire the first</text>
  <text start="467.09" dur="6.02">shot actually even if they&amp;#39;re fired upon</text>
  <text start="470.51" dur="5.73">I don&amp;#39;t even think they would fire back</text>
  <text start="473.11" dur="6.1">because they know what the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="476.24" dur="5.04">trying to do they know what Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="479.21" dur="5.91">trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying to provoke</text>
  <text start="481.28" dur="6.24">them once again to go to war Russia is</text>
  <text start="485.12" dur="4.76">beating the Islamic state in Syria the</text>
  <text start="487.52" dur="5.46">u.s. their backs are against the wall</text>
  <text start="489.88" dur="6.4">they have no alternative at this point</text>
  <text start="492.98" dur="5.58">but to push forward doesn&amp;#39;t mean their</text>
  <text start="496.28" dur="5.81">plans are going to work out absolutely</text>
  <text start="498.56" dur="6.15">not but their goals are always the same</text>
  <text start="502.09" dur="4.99">so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch this this</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="4.85">situation very very carefully because we</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="5.399">see things are really heating up and</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="5.409">we&amp;#39;re gonna see something happen that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.479" dur="5.75">going to be really big very soon now we</text>
  <text start="514.969" dur="5.461">see the United States is orchestrating</text>
  <text start="518.229" dur="4.841">everything that&amp;#39;s going on in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="520.43" dur="6.51">they control the government they tell</text>
  <text start="523.07" dur="5.97">them what to do same thing in the Middle</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="4.44">East with all those puppet governments</text>
  <text start="529.04" dur="6.87">and we can see the United States is</text>
  <text start="531.38" dur="7.17">behind this and Russia laid out what</text>
  <text start="535.91" dur="4.38">exactly happened there gathering</text>
  <text start="538.55" dur="4.89">evidence they&amp;#39;re presenting it to the</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="5.28">United States and the United States is</text>
  <text start="543.44" dur="5.16">out there the US ambassador to Ukraine</text>
  <text start="545.57" dur="4.92">Geoffrey Pyatt who says that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="548.6" dur="3.63">see any evidence to back up Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="550.49" dur="4.86">claim that Ukraine was preparing an act</text>
  <text start="552.23" dur="5.82">of provocation in Crimea and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.35" dur="6.53">just nothing so far that cooperates</text>
  <text start="558.05" dur="7.38">Russian allegation there&amp;#39;s nothing here</text>
  <text start="561.88" dur="6.34">well then they say that in Turkey</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="6.3">and all the evidence is pointing to the</text>
  <text start="568.22" dur="7.309">United States every time the United</text>
  <text start="571.73" dur="5.88">States comes out and says we see nothing</text>
  <text start="575.529" dur="4.901">ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine</text>
  <text start="577.61" dur="6.72">nine nine nine percent of the time they</text>
  <text start="580.43" dur="6.75">are behind it so the Russian Federal</text>
  <text start="584.33" dur="5.25">Security Service said that they have</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="4.59">eliminated the spy ring which was</text>
  <text start="589.58" dur="6.87">organized by the Ukrainian defense</text>
  <text start="591.77" dur="6.89">ministry in Crimea and they got their</text>
  <text start="596.45" dur="5.49">documents they got their information</text>
  <text start="598.66" dur="4.9">that they were preparing to sabotage the</text>
  <text start="601.94" dur="5.16">critical and life-supporting elements in</text>
  <text start="603.56" dur="10.02">that area and we know that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="607.1" dur="9.72">backing the Ukraine government and we</text>
  <text start="613.58" dur="5.39">know that this was the plan from the</text>
  <text start="616.82" dur="6.51">beginning now the plan did not work out</text>
  <text start="618.97" dur="7.54">but Russia knows the u.s. is not going</text>
  <text start="623.33" dur="5.19">to give up because their goal like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="626.51" dur="4.29">been saying for a very long time is to</text>
  <text start="628.52" dur="4.5">get Crimea back and the southeastern</text>
  <text start="630.8" dur="4.729">section they did not get what they paid</text>
  <text start="633.02" dur="6.33">for they paid for the entire Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="635.529" dur="8.111">the central bankers they want what they</text>

  <text start="643.64" dur="7.38">drill now in the Black Sea it is a</text>
  <text start="648.38" dur="4.56">three-day anti sabotage drill to counter</text>
  <text start="651.02" dur="5.009">potential under underwater attacks and</text>
  <text start="652.94" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re doing this on purpose right now</text>
  <text start="656.029" dur="4.56">because they see what is happening and</text>
  <text start="658.04" dur="4.919">they&amp;#39;re bringing their forces into this</text>
  <text start="660.589" dur="4.981">area now a lot of times the u.s.</text>

  <text start="722.51" dur="3.99">Italy is going to reopen their embassy</text>
  <text start="724.79" dur="4.08">they closed it back in February of 2015</text>
  <text start="726.5" dur="3.87">and now they&amp;#39;re going to reopen it in</text>
  <text start="728.87" dur="5.01">Tripoli why because the unity government</text>
  <text start="730.37" dur="6">is there and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="733.88" dur="5.399">Italy they have their special forces</text>
  <text start="736.37" dur="6.81">operating in Libya with UK with France</text>
  <text start="739.279" dur="6.331">and the United States and the sources</text>
  <text start="743.18" dur="4.82">said they were there operating under the</text>
  <text start="745.61" dur="4.979">direct command of the premier&amp;#39;s office</text>
  <text start="748" dur="5.32">now remember the unity government has</text>
  <text start="750.589" dur="7.921">made a call out to the international</text>
  <text start="753.32" dur="7.139">community for their help and I would</text>
  <text start="758.51" dur="4.38">suspect in the next couple of days or</text>
  <text start="760.459" dur="5.011">maybe a couple weeks we will see other</text>
  <text start="762.89" dur="4.65">countries get involved in Libya</text>
  <text start="765.47" dur="3.5">they&amp;#39;re already involved but we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="767.54" dur="4.62">to see more of it</text>
  <text start="768.97" dur="6.7">Turkey right now is moving closer and</text>
  <text start="772.16" dur="5.82">closer to Russia so all the indicators</text>
  <text start="775.67" dur="4.88">that we are seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="777.98" dur="5.64">Russia and Turkey are getting closer</text>
  <text start="780.55" dur="7.27">Turkey and the US are moving further and</text>
  <text start="783.62" dur="7.05">further away and Turkey lashed out at</text>
  <text start="787.82" dur="5.519">NATO saying NATO has no right to dictate</text>
  <text start="790.67" dur="5.159">what foreign policy decisions turkey</text>
  <text start="793.339" dur="6.961">should take and what countries it should</text>
  <text start="795.829" dur="6.901">build relations with and Turkey is a</text>
  <text start="800.3" dur="7.32">sovereign country and NATO does not have</text>
  <text start="802.73" dur="6.51">this right so Turkey what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="807.62" dur="3.99">right now is they&amp;#39;re going to resume</text>
  <text start="809.24" dur="6.87">airstrikes against the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="811.61" dur="6.719">working with Russia so does that mean</text>
  <text start="816.11" dur="3.839">turkey is abandoning the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="818.329" dur="3.601">this is what Russia wants them to do</text>
  <text start="819.949" dur="5.521">they want them to close the borders</text>
  <text start="821.93" dur="4.86">between Syria and Turkey and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="825.47" dur="3.96">have to watch this situation very</text>
  <text start="826.79" dur="5.31">closely but earlier one came out and</text>
  <text start="829.43" dur="7.649">this is a huge blow to the</text>
  <text start="832.1" dur="8.46">u.s. he is now suggesting that Turkey</text>
  <text start="837.079" dur="7.411">will abandon the US dollar in bilateral</text>
  <text start="840.56" dur="9.589">trade between Turkey and Russia they</text>
  <text start="844.49" dur="9.75">will transact in lira or rubles directly</text>
  <text start="850.149" dur="6.521">so here is another country where Russia</text>
  <text start="854.24" dur="5.459">and China have stepped in and said</text>
  <text start="856.67" dur="5.49">listen we don&amp;#39;t need the dollar we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="859.699" dur="6.83">just go through our currencies bypass it</text>
  <text start="862.16" dur="7.489">completely and this is continuing and</text>
  <text start="866.529" dur="6.101">more and more countries are doing this</text>
  <text start="869.649" dur="5.981">which is not a very good sign because</text>
  <text start="872.63" dur="6.6">what this means is is that once the</text>
  <text start="875.63" dur="8.43">Middle East Falls once these countries</text>
  <text start="879.23" dur="7.95">take back and control the oil production</text>
  <text start="884.06" dur="6.54">and they sell the oil not using the</text>
  <text start="887.18" dur="7.579">dollar the petro dollar yes it is doomed</text>
  <text start="890.6" dur="8.27">and all the countries that are dealing</text>
  <text start="894.759" dur="6.341">outside of the dollar they&amp;#39;ll be okay</text>
  <text start="898.87" dur="4.389">those countries that are holding on to</text>
  <text start="901.1" dur="4.44">the dollar they&amp;#39;re gonna have a problem</text>
  <text start="903.259" dur="4.32">the countries that are not using the</text>
  <text start="905.54" dur="3.75">dollar for reserves they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="907.579" dur="3.93">whole on to the dollar they&amp;#39;ll send it</text>
  <text start="909.29" dur="4.799">back to the US and this is where we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="911.509" dur="6.75">see hyperinflation this is where we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="914.089" dur="7.43">see the dollar collapse and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.259" dur="8.31">getting very close to this point in time</text>
  <text start="921.519" dur="8.201">we see Russia they have bombed the</text>
  <text start="926.569" dur="6.12">Islamic state chemical factories where</text>
  <text start="929.72" dur="5.239">they created their chemical weapons we</text>

  <text start="944.389" dur="7.591">that was the United States and we see</text>
  <text start="948.38" dur="6.329">right now the United States their plans</text>
  <text start="951.98" dur="3.75">are not going well at all and I</text>
  <text start="954.709" dur="2.641">shouldn&amp;#39;t say the United States because</text>
  <text start="955.73" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s really not the people it&amp;#39;s the</text>
