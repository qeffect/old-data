  <text start="105.64" dur="5.08">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="107.93" dur="4.829">financial news now the central bankers</text>
  <text start="110.72" dur="4.289">they are getting really really nervous</text>
  <text start="112.759" dur="4.53">about the blockchain cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="115.009" dur="4.17">the banks they don&amp;#39;t even know to do at</text>
  <text start="117.289" dur="3.841">this point and they don&amp;#39;t know which</text>
  <text start="119.179" dur="3.901">direction to go in should they join the</text>
  <text start="121.13" dur="3.599">blockchain but then again if they do</text>
  <text start="123.08" dur="4.289">join the blockchain people will figure</text>
  <text start="124.729" dur="4.831">out that do we really need the banks to</text>
  <text start="127.369" dur="3.811">handle any transactions that we really</text>
  <text start="129.56" dur="3.33">need to go through the banking system</text>
  <text start="131.18" dur="2.76">for this and this is what they&amp;#39;re most</text>
  <text start="132.89" dur="5.55">afraid of now</text>
  <text start="133.94" dur="7.56">German online bank bit bond announced it</text>
  <text start="138.44" dur="5.82">now allows users to transfer loans</text>
  <text start="141.5" dur="6.02">anywhere in the world using Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="144.26" dur="3.26">other Kryptonian</text>
  <text start="154.4" dur="5.55">and this is going to hurt the banks why</text>
  <text start="157.459" dur="5.731">because you can bypass the banks it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.95" dur="6.08">almost like countries who are trading in</text>
  <text start="163.19" dur="7.32">their own currency or maybe the yen or</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="8.23">the ruble or the you wan or anything</text>
  <text start="170.51" dur="6.059">else and they bypass the dollar what</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="4.65">does it do it hurts the dollar the same</text>
  <text start="176.569" dur="4.98">thing that&amp;#39;s happening here people are</text>
  <text start="178.91" dur="4.469">starting to figure out that hey we</text>
  <text start="181.549" dur="4.951">really don&amp;#39;t need the banks now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.379" dur="5.341">very interesting is that HSB</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="4.8">see you know the bank that was</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="3.81">implicated in money laundering scandals</text>
  <text start="191.3" dur="3.63">and everything else like that</text>
  <text start="192.53" dur="4.53">has completed the world&amp;#39;s first</text>
  <text start="194.93" dur="5.79">commercially viable trade finance</text>
  <text start="197.06" dur="6.42">transaction using blockchain in the</text>
  <text start="200.72" dur="5.82">process opening the door to mass</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="5.34">adoption of the technology in the nine</text>
  <text start="206.54" dur="4.98">trillion market for trade finance now</text>
  <text start="208.82" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re trying to bring this in but once</text>
  <text start="211.52" dur="7.23">again why do we need the banking system</text>
  <text start="215.18" dur="5.91">there&amp;#39;s no reason for it and they</text>
  <text start="218.75" dur="5.37">understand this and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.09" dur="6.93">trying to figure out some way somehow to</text>
  <text start="224.12" dur="6.99">join in on this new technology now the</text>
  <text start="228.02" dur="5.7">blockchain is developed where it allows</text>
  <text start="231.11" dur="5.4">people to basically have these</text>
  <text start="233.72" dur="5.489">transactions without the banking system</text>
  <text start="236.51" dur="5.25">you can get paid without the banking</text>
  <text start="239.209" dur="5.131">system you can loan money to people</text>
  <text start="241.76" dur="4.979">without the banking system you can</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="4.47">receive a loan without the banking</text>
  <text start="246.739" dur="3.691">system you can do all of this without</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="3.959">the banking system this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="4.589">afraid of we see the New York Stock</text>
  <text start="252.769" dur="4.231">Exchange they&amp;#39;re planning for physical</text>
  <text start="255.019" dur="4.59">delivery of Bitcoin remember they have a</text>
  <text start="257" dur="5.1">futures market and instead of using</text>
  <text start="259.609" dur="5.431">finite currency they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="262.1" dur="5.16">Bitcoin now again what does this really</text>
  <text start="265.04" dur="3.87">mean well it started out with the co max</text>
  <text start="267.26" dur="3.06">that they would physically deliver gold</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="3.72">and then eventually what happened they</text>
  <text start="270.32" dur="4.409">said yeah we&amp;#39;re gonna use fiat currency</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="3.72">I think in the beginning stages to get</text>
  <text start="274.729" dur="3.331">to convince everyone to get into the</text>
  <text start="276.35" dur="3.84">futures market they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="278.06" dur="4.38">move in this direction and then</text>
  <text start="280.19" dur="5.7">eventually move away from it to try to</text>
  <text start="282.44" dur="5.19">destroy what is happening in the crypto</text>
  <text start="285.89" dur="3.69">market and they&amp;#39;re gonna try to push</text>
  <text start="287.63" dur="4.02">this and I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="289.58" dur="3.63">work but we can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.65" dur="3.81">doing whatever they possibly can to try</text>
  <text start="293.21" dur="4.14">to maneuver people around this to say</text>
  <text start="295.46" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;re still needed this is why you need</text>
  <text start="297.35" dur="6.69">it and I&amp;#39;m thinking right now that a lot</text>
  <text start="301.01" dur="7.08">of the wealthy people the elites they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="304.04" dur="5.879">starting to realize that guess what this</text>
  <text start="308.09" dur="3.9">is going to be the new future of</text>
  <text start="309.919" dur="3.151">currency and they&amp;#39;re preparing for this</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="3">and I&amp;#39;m going to tell you how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="4.529">preparing for this in just a moment but</text>
  <text start="314.99" dur="5.52">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the st.</text>
  <text start="317.599" dur="5.131">Louis Fed President James bull yard</text>
  <text start="320.51" dur="4.95">came out and he was talking about</text>
  <text start="322.73" dur="6.6">cryptocurrencies again and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="6.36">that crypto currencies they are not a</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="4.86">currency and he&amp;#39;s saying that listen</text>
  <text start="331.82" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re not a currency because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.19" dur="6.21">not created by a central bank and</text>
  <text start="337.4" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s no central management of the</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="3.03">cryptocurrency which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="342.68" dur="2.76">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="4.71">and he&amp;#39;s also saying crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="345.44" dur="5.7">are backed by absolutely nothing well</text>
  <text start="348.14" dur="5.34">what is the dollar back by what is the</text>
  <text start="351.14" dur="4.88">you wan back by what is the rule back by</text>
  <text start="353.48" dur="6.03">what is any of these things back by</text>
  <text start="356.02" dur="5.2">absolutely nothing as soon as we came</text>
  <text start="359.51" dur="3.96">off the gold standard they are backed by</text>
  <text start="361.22" dur="5.31">nothing and again what is gold backed by</text>
  <text start="363.47" dur="5.49">well it&amp;#39;s the belief and it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="366.53" dur="4.2">understanding that this is worth</text>
  <text start="368.96" dur="3.96">something and if a lot of people believe</text>
  <text start="370.73" dur="3.96">this then it&amp;#39;s worth something the same</text>
  <text start="372.92" dur="3.24">that wasn&amp;#39;t crypto currency you just</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="2.85">can&amp;#39;t pick it up on the street and say</text>
  <text start="376.16" dur="4.02">hey look I have a couple of bitcoins</text>
  <text start="377.54" dur="5.76">here it takes a lot of horsepower a lot</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="3.6">of processing energy to create these</text>
  <text start="383.3" dur="2.64">coins</text>
  <text start="383.78" dur="4.1">unlike the central bank where they can</text>
  <text start="385.94" dur="5.1">create trillions of dollars without</text>
  <text start="387.88" dur="5.23">energy without work without anything and</text>
  <text start="391.04" dur="4.2">they can do it in a split second but the</text>
  <text start="393.11" dur="4.95">worst part about the finance system is</text>
  <text start="395.24" dur="5.34">that once they create it they loan it to</text>
  <text start="398.06" dur="4.5">governments with interest attached which</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="4.98">then trickles down to the everyday</text>
  <text start="402.56" dur="4.38">person where it enslaves the people</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="3.18">where they have to pay this back and</text>
  <text start="406.94" dur="4.79">then you have to hook taxes to this to</text>
  <text start="408.74" dur="5.88">pay back all of this funny money</text>
  <text start="411.73" dur="5.65">compared to cryptocurrency when it is</text>
  <text start="414.62" dur="6.6">created guess what there is no interest</text>
  <text start="417.38" dur="5.46">attached there&amp;#39;s no payback there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.22" dur="5.28">nothing you have to do</text>
  <text start="422.84" dur="6.65">same thing with gold and silver gold and</text>
  <text start="426.5" dur="6.3">silver if we are using this as a base</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="4.84">there is no payback plus gold and silver</text>
  <text start="432.8" dur="5.13">just like cryptocurrencies are both same</text>
  <text start="434.33" dur="5.46">mining you need equipment it takes time</text>
  <text start="437.93" dur="3.99">you need to find deposit you have to</text>
  <text start="439.79" dur="7.29">really find out where it is and</text>
  <text start="441.92" dur="8.73">basically this builds the value of this</text>
  <text start="447.08" dur="6.36">type of currency compared to the central</text>
  <text start="450.65" dur="3.63">bank where they just print it out of</text>
  <text start="453.44" dur="2.64">thin air</text>
  <text start="454.28" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s no work behind it they loaned it</text>
  <text start="456.08" dur="2.91">to governments where they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="5.01">loaning it to the people with interest</text>
  <text start="458.99" dur="6.21">attached now we understand the elite</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="5.19">they always know what&amp;#39;s happening they</text>
  <text start="465.2" dur="4.29">always realize way in advance because</text>
  <text start="467.81" dur="4.32">they can see the writing on the wall</text>
  <text start="469.49" dur="4.14">and they prepare for certain scenarios</text>
  <text start="472.13" dur="2.94">like the stock market they have the</text>
  <text start="473.63" dur="3.63">insider information they understand what</text>
  <text start="475.07" dur="4.47">is happening and everything else and we</text>
  <text start="477.26" dur="4.71">can see right now the elite right now</text>
  <text start="479.54" dur="4.41">they understand that the crypto market</text>
  <text start="481.97" dur="4.23">is brand-new the blockchain technology</text>
  <text start="483.95" dur="4.05">and they realize that eventually we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.2" dur="4.38">going to be transitioning into this now</text>
  <text start="488" dur="4.44">gold is also going to be a part of this</text>
  <text start="490.58" dur="4.35">because this is going to be used as a</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="4.95">confidence builder maybe on a very high</text>
  <text start="494.93" dur="3.87">level with countries looking at other</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="3.18">countries maybe like China and Russia</text>
  <text start="498.8" dur="3.69">where they&amp;#39;re saying listen we have a</text>
  <text start="500.57" dur="3.84">lot of gold or backing everything up</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="3.96">this is the confidence builder but on a</text>
  <text start="504.41" dur="4.41">lower level we&amp;#39;re gonna be using crypto</text>
  <text start="506.45" dur="4.92">currencies because again it is easier to</text>
  <text start="508.82" dur="4.769">transact and we can use the blockchain</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="4.289">and it is a truth machine where we can</text>
  <text start="513.589" dur="5.161">track everything and we know who&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="515.659" dur="9.061">what now the elite they are hoarding</text>
  <text start="518.75" dur="9">right now a huge amount of Bitcoin over</text>
  <text start="524.72" dur="5.04">ten billion worth of Bitcoin right now</text>
  <text start="527.75" dur="4.79">is being placed under grant in</text>
  <text start="529.76" dur="5.55">underground bunkers across the world and</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="4.99">we&amp;#39;re seeing there are companies like</text>
  <text start="535.31" dur="3.99">zap oh they built a network of</text>
  <text start="537.53" dur="5.16">underground vaults on five continents</text>
  <text start="539.3" dur="6.69">including one in a decommissioned Swiss</text>
  <text start="542.69" dur="5.43">military bunker and they are keeping</text>
  <text start="545.99" dur="3.599">these elites offlined</text>
  <text start="548.12" dur="3.3">wallets they&amp;#39;re not connected to the</text>
  <text start="549.589" dur="5.431">network so you can&amp;#39;t mess with them and</text>
  <text start="551.42" dur="6">their vaulting their private keys to</text>
  <text start="555.02" dur="5.31">make sure that nobody gets hold of it</text>
  <text start="557.42" dur="6.3">and what we see happening right now is</text>
  <text start="560.33" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re realizing that eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="563.72" dur="4.86">going to happen is they&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="566.42" dur="5.55">their funds their currency in</text>
  <text start="568.58" dur="5.19">cryptocurrency for this transition now</text>
  <text start="571.97" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re also doing this with gold and</text>
  <text start="573.77" dur="3.54">things like that</text>
  <text start="575" dur="5.1">but we can see right now they are now</text>
  <text start="577.31" dur="5.13">moving into this realm and this should</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="6.45">tell you something they should tell you</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="5.79">that we are headed in this direction why</text>
  <text start="586.55" dur="4.38">because the</text>
  <text start="588.23" dur="4.92">higher central bank system is completely</text>
  <text start="590.93" dur="5.34">collapsing and falling apart I mean look</text>
  <text start="593.15" dur="5.88">into Argentina right now their peso is</text>
  <text start="596.27" dur="4.53">collapsing and it looks like the central</text>
  <text start="599.03" dur="3.21">bank they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="600.8" dur="4.29">possibly can they spent over 1 billion</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="5.22">buying pesos on Friday and it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="605.09" dur="3.9">work at all nothing is helping right now</text>
  <text start="607.46" dur="4.29">and it looks like the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="608.99" dur="6.45">starting to crash and the IMF the biz</text>
  <text start="611.75" dur="5.4">the Fed they realize the move here is to</text>
  <text start="615.44" dur="3.36">get rid of the central banks I believe</text>
  <text start="617.15" dur="3.66">this is the end game this is what Trump</text>
  <text start="618.8" dur="3.84">is moving towards the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="620.81" dur="5.28">moving towards is to eventually get rid</text>
  <text start="622.64" dur="5.28">of the central banking system and when</text>
  <text start="626.09" dur="3.78">you look to see what the central bank is</text>
  <text start="627.92" dur="3.45">doing right now you could see that</text>
  <text start="629.87" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re getting very nervous and afraid</text>
  <text start="631.37" dur="8.58">now the IMF they&amp;#39;re gonna be launching a</text>
  <text start="635.3" dur="9.48">public and private borrowing database</text>
  <text start="639.95" dur="7.5">now they&amp;#39;re going to take what everybody</text>
  <text start="644.78" dur="4.38">owes a hundred ninety countries will be</text>
  <text start="647.45" dur="4.89">included in the database and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="649.16" dur="6.53">going all the way back to 1950 that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="652.34" dur="7.02">right all the way back to 1950 and</text>
  <text start="655.69" dur="6.88">they&amp;#39;re going to keep everything in this</text>
  <text start="659.36" dur="6.27">database now the question is why are</text>
  <text start="662.57" dur="4.83">they doing this well you have to</text>
  <text start="665.63" dur="4.35">remember the global economy right now</text>
  <text start="667.4" dur="5.43">has a huge amount of debt and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="669.98" dur="4.8">rising very very quickly the central</text>
  <text start="672.83" dur="4.74">bank&amp;#39;s realize they can&amp;#39;t have the debt</text>
  <text start="674.78" dur="4.74">rise too quickly or it will implode the</text>
  <text start="677.57" dur="3.6">system it&amp;#39;s just the way the system is</text>
  <text start="679.52" dur="3.69">designed they understand this they like</text>
  <text start="681.17" dur="3.57">to keep everyone in limbo and when</text>
  <text start="683.21" dur="3.45">things get to a certain point where they</text>
  <text start="684.74" dur="3.39">can&amp;#39;t keep everyone in limbo what they</text>
  <text start="686.66" dur="3.99">need to do is they need to have an event</text>
  <text start="688.13" dur="3.66">and they need to have actually a war or</text>
  <text start="690.65" dur="4.74">something like that where they can say</text>
  <text start="691.79" dur="5.49">oh this is why we need to sacrifice this</text>
  <text start="695.39" dur="3.3">is what&amp;#39;s happening right now this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="697.28" dur="3.39">not because of debt it&amp;#39;s not because the</text>
  <text start="698.69" dur="3.78">economy it&amp;#39;s because of war and once the</text>
  <text start="700.67" dur="4.8">war is over what they can do is say</text>
  <text start="702.47" dur="5.79">listen the war demolished the financial</text>
  <text start="705.47" dur="5.4">system we need to restart it and this is</text>
  <text start="708.26" dur="4.82">how they get around wiping out the debt</text>
  <text start="710.87" dur="6.78">they still will hold certain countries</text>
  <text start="713.08" dur="7.51">you know to the debt but eventually what</text>
  <text start="717.65" dur="4.5">will happen is they will restart the</text>
  <text start="720.59" dur="4.25">system everything will be real</text>
  <text start="722.15" dur="5.13">valuated everything will be repriced and</text>
  <text start="724.84" dur="4.96">we will move on to a different currency</text>
  <text start="727.28" dur="4.44">this is what they normally do this time</text>
  <text start="729.8" dur="4.23">around I don&amp;#39;t believe they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="731.72" dur="4.65">the event that they want so they need to</text>
  <text start="734.03" dur="5.52">move into a different type of tactic now</text>
  <text start="736.37" dur="5.49">remember central bank&amp;#39;s they always see</text>
  <text start="739.55" dur="5.25">debt as listen you just can&amp;#39;t wipe it</text>
  <text start="741.86" dur="6.3">out you always oh it to us unless we say</text>
  <text start="744.8" dur="5.13">otherwise unless we cause you know the</text>
  <text start="748.16" dur="3.72">event where we can restart our system</text>
  <text start="749.93" dur="4.2">then we don&amp;#39;t really care that much but</text>
  <text start="751.88" dur="4.68">if we can&amp;#39;t restart the system then</text>
  <text start="754.13" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re going to use the debt to blackmail</text>
  <text start="756.56" dur="5.19">all the countries and with rising</text>
  <text start="759.65" dur="3.96">interest rates and what we see happening</text>
  <text start="761.75" dur="5.25">right now they&amp;#39;re very nervous so</text>
  <text start="763.61" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;re creating this database to keep</text>
  <text start="767" dur="6.96">track of who owes what when the system</text>
  <text start="770.33" dur="5.64">collapses and remember the central banks</text>
  <text start="773.96" dur="6.09">have always said that the deaths the</text>
  <text start="775.97" dur="7.92">debt must be repaid so they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="780.05" dur="7.41">keep a running tally now of private and</text>
  <text start="783.89" dur="6.09">public debt because remember all this</text>
  <text start="787.46" dur="5.91">currency that was issued around the</text>
  <text start="789.98" dur="7.38">world is not the people&amp;#39;s currency look</text>
  <text start="793.37" dur="8.01">at the Euro look at the dollar look at</text>
  <text start="797.36" dur="9.06">all of it it belongs to the central bank</text>
  <text start="801.38" dur="7.29">and it is a instrument of debt it is not</text>
  <text start="806.42" dur="5.9">something that you say well this has</text>
  <text start="808.67" dur="8.76">value it&amp;#39;s a debt instrument and you owe</text>
  <text start="812.32" dur="7.75">the debt on this funny money this</text>
  <text start="817.43" dur="5.76">currency that they created and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="820.07" dur="5.04">going to keep track now of all this and</text>
  <text start="823.19" dur="4.02">this is why the IMF is doing this</text>
  <text start="825.11" dur="4.47">because they understand eventually</text>
  <text start="827.21" dur="3.57">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the system is</text>
  <text start="829.58" dur="3.99">going to break down they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="830.78" dur="4.38">preparing for their system to collapse</text>
  <text start="833.57" dur="4.38">and I think what they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="835.16" dur="5.25">do with this database is they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="837.95" dur="4.47">to go to each country and say listen you</text>
  <text start="840.41" dur="3.99">will not transition away from us you owe</text>
  <text start="842.42" dur="4.29">this amount of debt the people owe this</text>
  <text start="844.4" dur="5.19">much debt and basically you need to</text>
  <text start="846.71" dur="6.09">repay this and you can&amp;#39;t move away</text>
  <text start="849.59" dur="5.81">because we want this how do you repay it</text>
  <text start="852.8" dur="3.41">well they can hand over gold I guess</text>
  <text start="855.4" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;re not going to accept</text>
  <text start="856.21" dur="4.98">cryptocurrency they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="858.31" dur="6.45">accept a new created currency by the</text>
  <text start="861.19" dur="5.67">government they&amp;#39;re gonna want land</text>
  <text start="864.76" dur="3.269">they&amp;#39;re gonna want other things and I</text>
  <text start="866.86" dur="3.06">think they&amp;#39;re gonna use this to</text>
  <text start="868.029" dur="3.301">blackmail countries to say listen if you</text>
  <text start="869.92" dur="3.3">can&amp;#39;t pay this back then you need to</text>
  <text start="871.33" dur="3.6">stay in the system until it&amp;#39;s all paid</text>
  <text start="873.22" dur="5.16">back which you know is completely</text>
  <text start="874.93" dur="5.159">impossible and they know this or they</text>
  <text start="878.38" dur="3.72">will say listen we&amp;#39;re gonna restart the</text>
  <text start="880.089" dur="3.541">system we will wipe out your debt but</text>
  <text start="882.1" dur="2.94">you will be in the new system and you</text>
  <text start="883.63" dur="4.11">cannot remove yourself from the new</text>
  <text start="885.04" dur="7.65">system they&amp;#39;re gonna use this to</text>
  <text start="887.74" dur="6.9">blackmail every single country to keep</text>
  <text start="892.69" dur="3.66">them in the system now we have crypto</text>
  <text start="894.64" dur="3.63">currencies on the other hand where the</text>
  <text start="896.35" dur="3.06">people and this is where the people this</text>
  <text start="898.27" dur="3.27">is where it&amp;#39;s very important for the</text>
  <text start="899.41" dur="3.45">people to say listen we don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="901.54" dur="3.42">in the central banking system and if we</text>
  <text start="902.86" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t use it even if the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="904.96" dur="4.98">agree in that the majority of the people</text>
  <text start="907.06" dur="5.67">the population says listen we will</text>
  <text start="909.94" dur="4.47">transact without the government because</text>
  <text start="912.73" dur="4.38">we don&amp;#39;t need the government to transact</text>
  <text start="914.41" dur="4.83">and we will use the cryptocurrency of</text>
  <text start="917.11" dur="6.83">our choice and as soon as the atomic</text>
  <text start="919.24" dur="10.92">swaps come into play and the exchanges</text>
  <text start="923.94" dur="7.99">become decentralized it&amp;#39;s game over for</text>
  <text start="930.16" dur="4.29">all these governments for all the</text>
  <text start="931.93" dur="4.77">central banks for everything because it</text>
  <text start="934.45" dur="4.77">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what crypto you&amp;#39;re in you</text>
  <text start="936.7" dur="5.55">can do an atomic swamp and you can</text>
  <text start="939.22" dur="5.369">purchase anything and you can see that</text>
  <text start="942.25" dur="5.22">at this point that would be even maybe</text>
  <text start="944.589" dur="5.401">even better to have that because it</text>
  <text start="947.47" dur="5.19">would be very very difficult then to</text>
  <text start="949.99" dur="5.67">control the cryptocurrencies because</text>
  <text start="952.66" dur="6.26">it&amp;#39;s not just one currency anymore it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="955.66" dur="7.02">many different currencies and basically</text>
  <text start="958.92" dur="7.18">it would be very difficult for a central</text>
  <text start="962.68" dur="5.49">bank or an individual or anyone else to</text>
  <text start="966.1" dur="4.17">try to smash one down because if people</text>
  <text start="968.17" dur="4.44">are using many and everything is</text>
  <text start="970.27" dur="4.71">decentralized it makes it very very</text>
  <text start="972.61" dur="4.77">difficult and I think this is where this</text>
  <text start="974.98" dur="3.45">is all headed and like I said this is</text>
  <text start="977.38" dur="3.69">like the beginning stages of the</text>
  <text start="978.43" dur="4.409">internet and the central banks they are</text>
  <text start="981.07" dur="3.95">sweating it out the banks are sweating</text>
  <text start="982.839" dur="4.411">it out and you can see how quickly</text>
  <text start="985.02" dur="4.57">everything is moving I mean in the</text>
  <text start="987.25" dur="7.44">beginning of this report we talked about</text>
  <text start="989.59" dur="8.16">how this online bank bit bond and this</text>
  <text start="994.69" dur="5.97">is in Germany how they&amp;#39;re allowing users</text>
  <text start="997.75" dur="7.41">to transfer loans anywhere in the world</text>
  <text start="1000.66" dur="6.75">using bitcoins and other Kryptos which</text>
  <text start="1005.16" dur="4.86">means a lot of people are going to be</text>
  <text start="1007.41" dur="4.49">using the blockchain and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1010.02" dur="5.4">going to be using the banking systems</text>
  <text start="1011.9" dur="5.44">you don&amp;#39;t need them so you can see how</text>
  <text start="1015.42" dur="3.21">quickly this is happening especially</text>
  <text start="1017.34" dur="2.64">when there&amp;#39;s technology already out</text>
  <text start="1018.63" dur="2.85">there and you have the internet you have</text>
  <text start="1019.98" dur="3.36">everything else and everyone uses the</text>
  <text start="1021.48" dur="4.01">excuses of what happens if the internet</text>
  <text start="1023.34" dur="4.29">goes on well if the internet goes down</text>
  <text start="1025.49" dur="4.89">everything comes to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="1027.63" dur="6.06">how much is on the Internet today</text>
  <text start="1030.38" dur="5.77">everything if the internet goes down you</text>
  <text start="1033.69" dur="4.32">can forget pretty much everything I mean</text>
  <text start="1036.15" dur="3.63">yeah maybe we&amp;#39;ll be buying locally and</text>
  <text start="1038.01" dur="4.08">stuff and this is why I still say you</text>
  <text start="1039.78" dur="4.44">should have gold and silver I mean they</text>
  <text start="1042.09" dur="6.54">can try that but that would hurt the</text>
  <text start="1044.22" dur="6.81">world economy would make no sense and I</text>
  <text start="1048.63" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t believe those people at this point</text>
  <text start="1051.03" dur="5.49">are gonna push it to that extreme and if</text>
  <text start="1054.27" dur="5.88">they do it&amp;#39;s bringing us back to the</text>
  <text start="1056.52" dur="5.19">dark ages at that point and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1060.15" dur="3.72">gonna be able to use their system</text>
  <text start="1061.71" dur="3.87">because once they bring that down guess</text>
  <text start="1063.87" dur="4.11">what online banking and all the other</text>
  <text start="1065.58" dur="5.16">stuff that they can control completely</text>
  <text start="1067.98" dur="6.36">disappears also so I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1070.74" dur="5.58">gonna move to that extreme I think</text>
  <text start="1074.34" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re gonna try other methods because</text>
  <text start="1076.32" dur="5.52">it won&amp;#39;t make any sense at this point to</text>
  <text start="1079.59" dur="5.61">do so we can see right now that things</text>
  <text start="1081.84" dur="6">are changing rapidly the transition it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1085.2" dur="4.05">being prepared right now central banks</text>
  <text start="1087.84" dur="3.96">are going to try to fight it with this</text>
  <text start="1089.25" dur="5.19">database that they&amp;#39;re creating and we</text>
  <text start="1091.8" dur="6.18">can see that again we&amp;#39;re heading towards</text>
  <text start="1094.44" dur="6.72">a crossroads here and we&amp;#39;re heading to a</text>
  <text start="1097.98" dur="4.89">point where we have one side the central</text>
  <text start="1101.16" dur="3.93">banks where they want to control the</text>
  <text start="1102.87" dur="3.99">narrative and we have the Patriots the</text>

  <text start="1106.86" dur="4.08">from the deep state from the central</text>
  <text start="1109.05" dur="4.83">banking system on the other side and</text>
  <text start="1110.94" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re going to be butting heads very</text>
