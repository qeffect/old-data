  <text start="58.109" dur="6.891">episode 1560 2bn today&amp;#39;s date is May 7th</text>
  <text start="62.6" dur="5.589">2018 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65" dur="6.25">prepare yourself deep state narrative</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="4.801">falling apart let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.25" dur="5.72">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.99" dur="8.76">geopolitical news now we are entering</text>
  <text start="76.97" dur="6.969">very troubled times because the deep</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="4.71">state they are being called out on</text>
  <text start="83.939" dur="4.621">pretty much everything and their</text>
  <text start="86.46" dur="5.76">narrative is falling apart and if their</text>
  <text start="88.56" dur="6.15">narrative falls apart guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="92.22" dur="4.95">going to make a move and this is why in</text>
  <text start="94.71" dur="4.799">the title I said prepare yourself</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="5.759">because what we are seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="99.509" dur="5.22">that Mueller&amp;#39;s case is literally falling</text>
  <text start="102.929" dur="4.591">apart even though the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="5.161">not presenting it that way if you look</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="5.58">really closely at what is happening you</text>
  <text start="109.89" dur="4.92">can see that things well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="113.1" dur="4.71">going well and remember I talked about</text>
  <text start="114.81" dur="5.929">propaganda propaganda works really</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="5.46">really well until you have to show proof</text>
  <text start="120.739" dur="4.841">that&amp;#39;s when it starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="123.27" dur="3.87">because yeah you can point fingers you</text>
  <text start="125.58" dur="4.739">can say things you can bring charges</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="6.27">against someone but when a lawyer or a</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="5.611">judge or anyone says can you show me the</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="4.38">proof can you show me the evidence that</text>
  <text start="135.93" dur="4.919">you have that where you made this</text>
  <text start="137.79" dur="5.55">decision on what you&amp;#39;re saying and if</text>
  <text start="140.849" dur="4.11">you can&amp;#39;t present it the propaganda</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="3.869">falls apart and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="144.959" dur="4.591">seeing right now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="147.209" dur="4.441">with Syria with the chemical gas attacks</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="4.35">and things like that you know when they</text>
  <text start="151.65" dur="5.699">say can we see the proof and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="153.9" dur="7.229">hand it over that&amp;#39;s how you know now</text>
  <text start="157.349" dur="5.851">three separate judges have rendered</text>
  <text start="161.129" dur="5.371">harsh setbacks to the Mueller</text>
  <text start="163.2" dur="4.02">investigation demanding if you can</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="4.29">believe it</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="6.9">facts and evidence to back up the</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="6.63">special counsels claims and they want</text>
  <text start="174.12" dur="5.729">unredacted format they want evidence</text>
  <text start="177.42" dur="5.25">they want all the information on how he</text>
  <text start="179.849" dur="6.381">came to his conclusions now federal</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="6.849">judge judge Emmett G Sullivan</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="6.839">ordered Mueller&amp;#39;s team to turn over any</text>
  <text start="189.519" dur="6.701">exculpatory evidence to Flynn&amp;#39;s defense</text>
  <text start="193.069" dur="6.091">now the judge invoked the brady rule</text>
  <text start="196.22" dur="5.43">which requires prosecutors to turn over</text>
  <text start="199.16" dur="4.29">previously unfiled evidence that it</text>
  <text start="201.65" dur="4.619">might have a material impact on a</text>

  <text start="225.23" dur="4.49">stroszek did not think Flint was lying</text>
  <text start="227.87" dur="4.86">to them and we discussed this before</text>
  <text start="229.72" dur="6.34">James Comey was recently caught lying</text>
  <text start="232.73" dur="4.95">about it himself a leaked transcript of</text>

  <text start="253.79" dur="6.21">authorizing the original investigation</text>
  <text start="255.889" dur="6.75">now Ellis also said that Mueller</text>
  <text start="260" dur="4.5">shouldn&amp;#39;t have unfettered power to</text>
  <text start="262.639" dur="3.631">prosecute Manta for four charges that</text>
  <text start="264.5" dur="4.11">have nothing to do with collusion</text>
  <text start="266.27" dur="5.49">between the Trump campaign and the</text>

  <text start="293.599" dur="4.25">Russians now this is where it gets</text>
  <text start="296.66" dur="4.68">really crazy</text>
  <text start="297.849" dur="6.94">remember Mueller accused the 13 Russian</text>
  <text start="301.34" dur="6.75">nationals and three Russian entities one</text>
  <text start="304.789" dur="7.231">of which was concorde management well</text>
  <text start="308.09" dur="8.43">guess what Concorde management decided</text>
  <text start="312.02" dur="7.11">to fight it and Mueller he probably</text>
  <text start="316.52" dur="2.97">didn&amp;#39;t see this coming at all because he</text>
  <text start="319.13" dur="2.49">knew</text>
  <text start="319.49" dur="3.899">that these individuals were in Russia</text>
  <text start="321.62" dur="3.57">and it would look like it was great</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="3.631">headlines and it would look like it had</text>
  <text start="325.19" dur="3.509">something to do with Russia and now</text>
  <text start="327.02" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re fighting back</text>
  <text start="328.699" dur="5.551">Concorde could now force prosecutors to</text>
  <text start="332.24" dur="4.769">turn over discovery about how the case</text>
  <text start="334.25" dur="4.47">was assembled as well as evidence that</text>
  <text start="337.009" dur="5.13">might undermine the prosecution&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="338.72" dur="5.25">theories Mueller&amp;#39;s team tried to say</text>
  <text start="342.139" dur="3.78">that Concorde never formally accepted</text>
  <text start="343.97" dur="4.199">the court summons related to the case</text>

  <text start="377.36" dur="8.52">means a lawyer whose methods are petty</text>
  <text start="380.71" dur="8.94">underhanded or disreputable and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="6.36">exactly what Mueller has been doing a</text>

  <text start="430.099" dur="8.1">road it&amp;#39;s all coming down around them</text>
  <text start="434.33" dur="6.389">why because they have no real proof it</text>
  <text start="438.199" dur="5.071">was all propaganda from the beginning</text>
  <text start="440.719" dur="6.721">and when they start to ask for real hard</text>
  <text start="443.27" dur="6.66">evidence and the methods used to get the</text>
  <text start="447.44" dur="5.19">evidence and to present the evidence</text>
  <text start="449.93" dur="5.55">that&amp;#39;s where propaganda falls</text>
  <text start="452.63" dur="4.65">and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing we</text>
  <text start="455.48" dur="4.26">see that former FBI director James Comey</text>
  <text start="457.28" dur="3.81">well it we found out that he often</text>
  <text start="459.74" dur="4.11">removes sensitive national security</text>
  <text start="461.09" dur="5.82">documents from the FBI headquarters and</text>
  <text start="463.85" dur="5.13">stored documents at his home and guess</text>
  <text start="466.91" dur="3.54">what you&amp;#39;re not allowed to do that of</text>
  <text start="468.98" dur="2.91">course he&amp;#39;s out there saying well I made</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="4.71">copies of them and I didn&amp;#39;t realize that</text>
  <text start="471.89" dur="5.76">was not part of the the requirements of</text>
  <text start="475.16" dur="6.33">classified information he knows exactly</text>
  <text start="477.65" dur="7.83">the law he knows exactly what he can and</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="6.84">cannot do and 18 US Code section 19 24</text>
  <text start="485.48" dur="4.68">stipulates whoever being an officer</text>
  <text start="488.33" dur="3.96">employee contractor or consultant of the</text>

  <text start="512.3" dur="6.39">imprisoned for not more than five years</text>
  <text start="514.52" dur="6.54">or both and we see right now that he</text>
  <text start="518.69" dur="4.71">knew exactly what was going on and again</text>
  <text start="521.06" dur="4.17">he was dealing with the Clinton emails</text>
  <text start="523.4" dur="4.11">she was trading in classified</text>
  <text start="525.23" dur="4.59">information so we can see why they were</text>
  <text start="527.51" dur="4.8">trying to keep this under the table</text>
  <text start="529.82" dur="4.38">where no one wanted to talk about it but</text>
  <text start="532.31" dur="3.9">now it&amp;#39;s all coming out and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.2" dur="4.98">starting to see that everything is</text>
  <text start="536.21" dur="6.6">closing in around them and they are in</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="5.25">big big big trouble right now now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="542.81" dur="4.22">starting to see some propaganda come out</text>
  <text start="544.43" dur="4.47">of North Korea where kim jung-eun</text>
  <text start="547.03" dur="4.06">supposedly and i think this is coming</text>
  <text start="548.9" dur="4.83">from the deep state saying listen trump</text>
  <text start="551.09" dur="4.77">better lay off or you know something</text>
  <text start="553.73" dur="4.65">Bad&amp;#39;s gonna happen with these peace</text>
  <text start="555.86" dur="4.11">deals it might not go forward and I</text>
  <text start="558.38" dur="4.65">think what&amp;#39;s happening right now is that</text>
  <text start="559.97" dur="6.3">the date of the summit is coming up and</text>
  <text start="563.03" dur="6.27">I think the deep state might be prepared</text>
  <text start="566.27" dur="5.46">to do something - maybe disrupt this</text>
  <text start="569.3" dur="4.2">whole entire thing because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="571.73" dur="6">like what is happening they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="573.5" dur="6.96">peace they want war and I think they</text>
  <text start="577.73" dur="4.5">might try something during this period</text>
  <text start="580.46" dur="3.45">and I think this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="582.23" dur="4.38">this a little bit of propaganda come out</text>
  <text start="583.91" dur="5.279">where all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="586.61" dur="3.959">we have a message and of course this is</text>
  <text start="589.189" dur="3.06">the corporate media who controls the</text>
  <text start="590.569" dur="2.94">corporate media to deep state you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="592.249" dur="3.57">really know if this is what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="593.509" dur="5.37">being said which is most likely not the</text>
  <text start="595.819" dur="5.281">case and we can see right now that they</text>
  <text start="598.879" dur="3.721">might be pushing this because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="601.1" dur="4.409">broadcasting what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="602.6" dur="6.299">they might try some type of an event</text>
  <text start="605.509" dur="6.18">during this summit to try to push this</text>
  <text start="608.899" dur="5.22">war so we can see right now that things</text>
  <text start="611.689" dur="4.2">might start to happen because we can see</text>
  <text start="614.119" dur="2.791">the whole Mueller case is starting to</text>
  <text start="615.889" dur="2.82">implode on it</text>
  <text start="616.91" dur="4.529">the whole Russian collusion is starting</text>
  <text start="618.709" dur="3.8">to implode and things are not going well</text>
  <text start="621.439" dur="4.5">at all</text>
  <text start="622.509" dur="6.401">Trump lashed out at John Kerry we know</text>
  <text start="625.939" dur="5.791">that John Kerry basically he&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="628.91" dur="5.969">shadow diplomacy he&amp;#39;s trying to go</text>
  <text start="631.73" dur="5.849">behind Trump&amp;#39;s back and make deals keep</text>

  <text start="637.579" dur="3.901">keep everything they have together</text>
  <text start="639.619" dur="4.71">because once everything starts to</text>
  <text start="641.48" dur="5.339">unravel and you find out who&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="644.329" dur="3.901">involved in these things that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="646.819" dur="3.87">things start to fall apart and this is</text>
  <text start="648.23" dur="4.319">not for peace this is not because they</text>
  <text start="650.689" dur="3.721">made great deals this is because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="652.549" dur="4.111">laundering money they&amp;#39;re involved in</text>
