  <text start="108.479" dur="5.401">you think it should go it might not</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="5.189">happen in the timeframe that you think</text>
  <text start="113.88" dur="5.93">it&amp;#39;s going to happen because your</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="6.93">expectations are different from the plan</text>
  <text start="119.81" dur="5.83">but if we start to look at what has been</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="4.32">happening and we look at certain</text>
  <text start="125.64" dur="7.2">indicators and we look at the events</text>
  <text start="127.829" dur="8.491">that have occurred we can see how the</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="6.63">plan is going to work do we know the</text>
  <text start="136.32" dur="7.29">exact timing no but we can look at it</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="8.31">and say hey we see it happening take for</text>
  <text start="143.61" dur="6.63">example the economy we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="147.78" dur="4.05">is going to make a move against the</text>
  <text start="150.24" dur="4.86">Federal Reserve this is why he has</text>
  <text start="151.83" dur="4.44">Andrew Jackson hanging on his wall it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.1" dur="3.3">not a coincidence</text>
  <text start="156.27" dur="5.609">he just didn&amp;#39;t throw it up there there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.4" dur="6.059">a reason for it and there&amp;#39;s a reason why</text>
  <text start="161.879" dur="3.251">Trump is continually contradicting the</text>
  <text start="164.459" dur="3.731">Fed</text>
  <text start="165.13" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s all part of the plan to make</text>
  <text start="168.19" dur="4.92">everyone aware of what the Fed is doing</text>
  <text start="170.38" dur="4.95">now remember the Fed many people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="173.11" dur="5.52">know about the Fed people don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="175.33" dur="5.34">understand what the Fed does or that the</text>
  <text start="178.63" dur="5.25">Fed is really not part of the government</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="6.54">Trump continually out there tweeting and</text>
  <text start="183.88" dur="6.72">contradicting the Fed he is bringing the</text>
  <text start="187.21" dur="5.16">attention to the Fed now everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.6" dur="3.99">probably saying well the only people</text>
  <text start="192.37" dur="3.81">that see that are those people that are</text>
  <text start="194.59" dur="3.54">following Trump those people that see</text>
  <text start="196.18" dur="4.53">his tweets well you have to remember</text>
  <text start="198.13" dur="5.28">good tweet bad tweet doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="200.71" dur="5.43">matter the mainstream media loves to</text>
  <text start="203.41" dur="5.91">take his tweets and they love to talk</text>
  <text start="206.14" dur="5.43">about it now they might say the actual</text>
  <text start="209.32" dur="5">opposite of what he&amp;#39;s trying to do but</text>
  <text start="211.57" dur="7.01">that doesn&amp;#39;t matter because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.32" dur="7.09">talking about the Fed telling the people</text>
  <text start="218.58" dur="6.67">what Trump is doing and how he&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="221.41" dur="7.02">this is actually part of the plan he</text>
  <text start="225.25" dur="6.48">wants people to think about what the Fed</text>
  <text start="228.43" dur="7.59">is actually doing and to question what</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="7.32">the Fed is actually doing and he needs</text>
  <text start="236.02" dur="6.33">to control the economy and convince the</text>
  <text start="239.05" dur="8.52">American people that he has made the</text>
  <text start="242.35" dur="10.95">economy look absolutely fantastic and he</text>
  <text start="247.57" dur="11.13">has accomplished that he has he has full</text>
  <text start="253.3" dur="6.96">control of the economic narrative we</text>
  <text start="258.7" dur="4.77">know the unemployment numbers came out</text>
  <text start="260.26" dur="6.36">today the BLS reported that in April the</text>
  <text start="263.47" dur="4.86">US economy added 263 thousand jobs now</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="4.23">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if these things are</text>
  <text start="268.33" dur="5.99">manipulated or not that people are not</text>
  <text start="270.85" dur="7.35">counted remember he&amp;#39;s using the weapons</text>
  <text start="274.32" dur="6.73">against them the same exact weapons that</text>
  <text start="278.2" dur="6.63">they use against us he&amp;#39;s using against</text>
  <text start="281.05" dur="6.75">them and they really can&amp;#39;t say much now</text>
  <text start="284.83" dur="6.03">according to these numbers construction</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="5.48">is up 33,000 jobs professional and</text>
  <text start="290.86" dur="5.67">business services they&amp;#39;re up 76,000</text>
  <text start="293.28" dur="5.04">Manufacturing&amp;#39;s up 4,000 jobs retail is</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="3.89">down 12,000 jobs</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="5.57">they lost 12,000 which makes sense</text>
  <text start="300.42" dur="7.14">because retail has been struggling</text>
  <text start="303.89" dur="6.7">the average early earnings year on year</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="5.76">has dropped the labor force</text>
  <text start="310.59" dur="4.86">participation rate unexpectedly dropped</text>
  <text start="313.32" dur="6.21">back to the lowest level since the 60s</text>
  <text start="315.45" dur="7.65">sliding from 63% to 62.8%</text>
  <text start="319.53" dur="5.31">the unemployment rate came down from</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="5.28">three point eight percent</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="9.12">down to three point six percent a new</text>
  <text start="328.38" dur="8.22">forty nine year low now if you look at</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="4.26">this and you just look at the numbers</text>
  <text start="336.6" dur="2.79">because this is the numbers that the</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="3.27">deep state the central banks have been</text>
  <text start="339.39" dur="5.91">putting out there this is what people</text>
  <text start="341.49" dur="5.61">look at Wow look what he just did the</text>
  <text start="345.3" dur="5.1">black population the Hispanic population</text>
  <text start="347.1" dur="6.51">the Asian population unemployment</text>
  <text start="350.4" dur="7.68">dropped to record low he&amp;#39;s controlling</text>
  <text start="353.61" dur="9.14">it all and at the same time what is he</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="8.61">doing he&amp;#39;s bringing manufacturers back</text>
  <text start="362.75" dur="7.96">he&amp;#39;s bringing businesses back and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.69" dur="8.16">getting companies to invest here in the</text>

  <text start="518.339" dur="8.281">this you feel good and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="523.01" dur="7">what he&amp;#39;s doing this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="526.62" dur="6.81">to make everyone feel good about the</text>
  <text start="530.01" dur="8.16">economy to make everyone understand that</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="6.81">he took a mediocre economy and built it</text>
  <text start="538.17" dur="3.63">up to what it is today now when people</text>
  <text start="540.24" dur="3.48">see jobs coming back like the steel</text>
  <text start="541.8" dur="5.37">industry this is going to create a lot</text>
  <text start="543.72" dur="5.79">of jobs when he sees other manufacturers</text>
  <text start="547.17" dur="6.33">coming back this is just going to add to</text>
  <text start="549.51" dur="6.54">it and the reason for all this which is</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="5.52">not going to happen right now not before</text>
  <text start="556.05" dur="6.15">the elections the reason for all this is</text>
  <text start="559.02" dur="5.75">to use this and turn it around to go</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="7.77">after the central bank system</text>
  <text start="564.77" dur="9.57">because he created an economy that is</text>
  <text start="569.97" dur="9.3">second to none anything the Fed does now</text>
  <text start="574.34" dur="7.95">any move they make they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="579.27" dur="6.24">blamed for bringing down the economy</text>
  <text start="582.29" dur="5.5">this has been the plan since the</text>
  <text start="585.51" dur="6.6">beginning now of course we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="587.79" dur="6.42">through different areas of the plan some</text>
  <text start="592.11" dur="3.69">of its not going to make sense and we</text>
  <text start="594.21" dur="3.5">need to understand that he still has</text>
  <text start="595.8" dur="4.77">seats to fill in the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="597.71" dur="6.34">he&amp;#39;s looking for the right person that</text>
  <text start="600.57" dur="6.17">is on the same page as him that will do</text>
  <text start="604.05" dur="5.79">what he needs them to do without</text>
  <text start="606.74" dur="5.08">question and I don&amp;#39;t mean that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="609.84" dur="4.17">not gonna question what they&amp;#39;re doing I</text>
  <text start="611.82" dur="3.81">mean they&amp;#39;re on the same page and</text>
  <text start="614.01" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re gonna go after the same exact</text>
  <text start="615.63" dur="8.25">thing where they&amp;#39;re going to get rid and</text>
  <text start="619.83" dur="7.26">restructure the Federal Reserve and then</text>
  <text start="623.88" dur="6.78">have the Fed bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="627.09" dur="5.1">later on remember they keep making the</text>
  <text start="630.66" dur="2.1">argument that the Fed has to be</text>
  <text start="632.19" dur="3.66">independent</text>
  <text start="632.76" dur="4.59">let it be independent let the Fed be</text>
  <text start="635.85" dur="5.25">independent that&amp;#39;s what everyone thinks</text>
  <text start="637.35" dur="4.89">and when they bring down the economic</text>
  <text start="641.1" dur="6.06">system because they wanted to raise</text>
  <text start="642.24" dur="9.27">rates this independent organization will</text>
  <text start="647.16" dur="7.89">be audited and Trump will continually</text>
  <text start="651.51" dur="6.77">tweet out and blame it all on the Fed</text>
  <text start="655.05" dur="7.38">now if the Fed is going to be blamed for</text>
  <text start="658.28" dur="7.9">the economy coming down the stock market</text>
  <text start="662.43" dur="5.88">coming down what about the rest of the</text>
  <text start="666.18" dur="7.29">central bank systems around the world</text>
  <text start="668.31" dur="7.11">the ECB the IMF will guess what like a</text>
  <text start="673.47" dur="5.31">domino effect remember they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.42" dur="7.08">responsible for the entire global</text>
  <text start="678.78" dur="6.36">economic system they tell countries what</text>
  <text start="682.5" dur="4.95">to do they tell countries listen if you</text>
  <text start="685.14" dur="6">want more money guess what you need</text>
  <text start="687.45" dur="6.75">austerity they dictate what they want</text>
  <text start="691.14" dur="4.89">the countries to do to get more currency</text>
  <text start="694.2" dur="4.02">to put them further and further into</text>
  <text start="696.03" dur="3.1">debt and they&amp;#39;re the ones who&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="699.13" dur="7.9">that everything has been fine yes things</text>
  <text start="703.91" dur="5.22">are slowing yes the global growth is not</text>
  <text start="707.03" dur="4.26">going the way we want but that&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="709.13" dur="5.19">of Trump now Trump is going to make the</text>
  <text start="711.29" dur="5.64">deal with China tariffs are not gonna be</text>
  <text start="714.32" dur="5.58">here forever he&amp;#39;s using them as leverage</text>
  <text start="716.93" dur="7.31">he wants jobs to come back here and once</text>
  <text start="719.9" dur="6.69">he removes the tariffs the central banks</text>
  <text start="724.24" dur="4.66">they&amp;#39;re standing there with their pants</text>
  <text start="726.59" dur="6.69">down they will have nothing at this</text>

  <text start="734.99" dur="6.48">economy look too good no they can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="738.23" dur="6.45">anything this is going to be the trap</text>
  <text start="741.47" dur="6.84">that he is setting because any move they</text>
  <text start="744.68" dur="6.3">make if the ECB decides to lower rates</text>
  <text start="748.31" dur="5.37">or increase rates and the economy starts</text>
