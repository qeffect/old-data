  <text start="88.78" dur="5.94">getting worse not better and if we use</text>
  <text start="91.84" dur="6.57">common sense we can realize that yeah</text>
  <text start="94.72" dur="4.98">the economy is not doing what the US</text>
  <text start="98.41" dur="4.92">government the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="99.7" dur="7.14">telling us it&amp;#39;s doing the opposite now</text>
  <text start="103.33" dur="5.489">when you really think about this you say</text>
  <text start="106.84" dur="5.19">to yourself okay we&amp;#39;re getting very</text>
  <text start="108.819" dur="6.481">close to full employment if we look in</text>
  <text start="112.03" dur="6.869">the past when we were very close to full</text>
  <text start="115.3" dur="7.319">employment we noticed that the economy</text>
  <text start="118.899" dur="7.89">did much much better we notice that</text>
  <text start="122.619" dur="8.151">retail expanded we noticed that housing</text>
  <text start="126.789" dur="7.051">improved we noticed the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="130.77" dur="6.52">continually increased because there was</text>
  <text start="133.84" dur="6.42">more demand they didn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="137.29" dur="5.34">manipulate the GDP numbers the</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="4.76">unemployment numbers the inflation</text>
  <text start="142.63" dur="6.26">numbers they didn&amp;#39;t have to change the</text>
  <text start="145.02" dur="8.86">calculations by adding in Obamacare</text>
  <text start="148.89" dur="7.8">research and development into the GDP we</text>
  <text start="153.88" dur="5.16">didn&amp;#39;t see a million manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="156.69" dur="7.48">leave the United States being replaced</text>
  <text start="159.04" dur="5.37">by a million or so part-time bartenders</text>
  <text start="164.17" dur="4.56">and</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="6.78">waiters and other part-time jobs they</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="9.83">never talked about negative interest</text>
  <text start="171.19" dur="10.92">rates or a cashless society you know why</text>
  <text start="178.56" dur="8.35">because they didn&amp;#39;t need to because the</text>
  <text start="182.11" dur="7.71">economy was working as best it possibly</text>
  <text start="186.91" dur="6.48">could under the control of the central</text>
  <text start="189.82" dur="6.72">bank but as we know the economy&amp;#39;s under</text>
  <text start="193.39" dur="6.09">a central bank using a Fiat system only</text>
  <text start="196.54" dur="4.71">lasts 40 to 45 years and we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="5.16">end stage of this in the beginning</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="6.57">stages things work out well the middle</text>
  <text start="204.64" dur="5.25">stage not bad they start to get a little</text>
  <text start="207.82" dur="5.1">bit worse and worse but as you can see</text>
  <text start="209.89" dur="8.28">as we are approaching the end cycle of</text>
  <text start="212.92" dur="7.11">this you can see exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="5.7">pushing and what agendas they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="220.03" dur="7.05">I mean if you look at this when did you</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="7.58">ever see interest rates at zero or even</text>
  <text start="227.08" dur="7.29">talked about going negative never and</text>
  <text start="231.45" dur="6.13">this is spreading its in Europe right</text>
  <text start="234.37" dur="4.5">now they already put out trial balloons</text>
  <text start="237.58" dur="2.97">in the United States with the Fed</text>
  <text start="238.87" dur="4.26">mentioning it because you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.55" dur="5.25">heading in that direction we already see</text>
  <text start="243.13" dur="6.6">Canada right now the Bank of Canada she</text>
  <text start="245.8" dur="8.31">finally said that yeah they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="249.73" dur="6.689">into negative interest rates Canada&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.11" dur="7.17">economy is still going to be in</text>
  <text start="256.419" dur="7.831">recession in 2016 zero percent interest</text>
  <text start="261.28" dur="5.43">rates will be in 2016 and later in 2016</text>
  <text start="264.25" dur="4.29">they are looking at negative interest</text>
  <text start="266.71" dur="4.41">rates I think it&amp;#39;s going to be much much</text>
  <text start="268.54" dur="4.29">sooner than that because the economy the</text>
  <text start="271.12" dur="5.49">way it&amp;#39;s going right now is completely</text>
  <text start="272.83" dur="6.48">falling apart and you know you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="276.61" dur="5.37">to see more and more currency printing</text>
  <text start="279.31" dur="6.78">as we go through 2016 because this</text>
  <text start="281.98" dur="6.75">collapse has been upon us it&amp;#39;s been here</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="5.07">and the only thing that&amp;#39;s keeping this</text>
  <text start="288.73" dur="5.85">illusion alive illusion alive is the</text>
  <text start="291.16" dur="6.66">stock market and the manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="294.58" dur="5.73">and as we look at what</text>
  <text start="297.82" dur="5.04">going on in the real economy we see that</text>
  <text start="300.31" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s what all those numbers are that</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="5.12">the government and central bank are</text>
  <text start="304" dur="5.88">putting out fake illusionary numbers</text>
  <text start="307.98" dur="5.05">because when we look at the real</text>
  <text start="309.88" dur="6.6">information we see everything is not</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="5.25">doing well look at the UK now of course</text>
  <text start="316.48" dur="3.51">they use the word unexpected this is a</text>
  <text start="318.28" dur="4.17">surprise to us I can&amp;#39;t believe this is</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="4.83">happening how can it be everything is</text>

  <text start="343.75" dur="7.89">have happened with the unemployment so</text>
  <text start="347.2" dur="6.27">low that everything is recovering well</text>
  <text start="351.64" dur="4.83">we all knew this was going to happen if</text>
  <text start="353.47" dur="4.68">you looked at reality if you looked at</text>
  <text start="356.47" dur="4.26">the illusionary governor government</text>
  <text start="358.15" dur="6.54">numbers in the UK throughout Europe and</text>

  <text start="606.25" dur="4.59">trying to take away but you can make</text>
  <text start="608.8" dur="5.13">that decision and what you want to do</text>
  <text start="610.84" dur="5.91">and the best way to do this is look at</text>
