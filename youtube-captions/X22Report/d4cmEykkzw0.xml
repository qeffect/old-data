  <text start="325.74" dur="8.85">people are going to be laid off and this</text>
  <text start="330.63" dur="6.21">is continuing throughout this fantastic</text>
  <text start="334.59" dur="3.87">recovery because whenever you see</text>
  <text start="336.84" dur="6.03">recovery what do you see</text>
  <text start="338.46" dur="9.39">layoffs well no you see things expand</text>
  <text start="342.87" dur="6.81">you see things grow you see more offices</text>
  <text start="347.85" dur="3.42">open where they hire more people if</text>
  <text start="349.68" dur="5.34">business is fantastic</text>
  <text start="351.27" dur="5.46">we know that IBM revenue for the last</text>
  <text start="355.02" dur="5.03">couple of months down we know</text>
  <text start="356.73" dur="7.05">caterpillar negative sales for 31 months</text>
  <text start="360.05" dur="6.61">and of course they came out today with</text>
  <text start="363.78" dur="5.13">their magical GDP numbers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="366.66" dur="3.87">telling us that the economy grew at two</text>
  <text start="368.91" dur="5.91">point three percent in the second</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="6.63">quarter and when we look at this we see</text>
  <text start="374.82" dur="5.49">okay the first quarter was negative</text>
  <text start="377.16" dur="9.15">negative 2.1 well without anyone looking</text>
  <text start="380.31" dur="7.91">they revised it to 0.9 percent so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="5.94">very interesting</text>
  <text start="388.22" dur="6.4">so they&amp;#39;re going backwards revising the</text>
  <text start="392.25" dur="7.68">numbers making everything look better</text>
  <text start="394.62" dur="7.41">than it really is and I&amp;#39;m sorry they</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="3.75">went back to 2014 and they took the</text>
  <text start="402.03" dur="2.91">negative two point one then they they</text>
  <text start="403.68" dur="4.29">brought it up to negative point nine</text>
  <text start="404.94" dur="5.039">last quarter it was negative point two</text>
  <text start="407.97" dur="7.56">percent and they brought it into the</text>
  <text start="409.979" dur="11.071">positive range of point six percent so</text>
  <text start="415.53" dur="8.19">we can see right now this is exactly</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="5.82">that what they do every single time they</text>
  <text start="423.72" dur="5.54">go backwards in time to make everything</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="2.39">look good</text>
  <text start="429.33" dur="6.209">but right now when we look at this the</text>
  <text start="431.189" dur="8.28">economic expansion is the worst on</text>
  <text start="435.539" dur="6.481">record since World War two since the</text>
  <text start="439.469" dur="5.04">recession ended in 2009 which is</text>
  <text start="442.02" dur="5.31">according to the government the economy</text>
  <text start="444.509" dur="5.31">has advanced at a 2.2 percent annual</text>
  <text start="447.33" dur="4.769">pace through the end of last year that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.819" dur="4.831">more than half percentage point worse</text>
  <text start="452.099" dur="7.37">than the next weakest expansion of the</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="7.169">past 70 years the one from 2001 to 2007</text>
  <text start="459.469" dur="5.111">while there have been highs and lows in</text>
  <text start="461.819" dur="5.19">individual quarters overall the economy</text>
  <text start="464.58" dur="6.329">has failed to break out of its roughly 2</text>
  <text start="467.009" dur="9.12">percent pattern for 6 years and when we</text>
  <text start="470.909" dur="10.021">look at the GDP numbers we start to see</text>
  <text start="476.129" dur="7.171">things here many said that the first</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="8.579">quarter economy does not expose the true</text>
  <text start="483.3" dur="7.889">strength of the US consumer instead of</text>
  <text start="489.509" dur="4.791">shopping in stores they&amp;#39;re shopping</text>
  <text start="491.189" dur="7.651">online which wasn&amp;#39;t captured or</text>
  <text start="494.3" dur="7.119">comparable and it doesn&amp;#39;t correlate so</text>
  <text start="498.84" dur="4.889">that kind of fell apart what actually</text>
  <text start="501.419" dur="4.68">happened was that personal consumption</text>
  <text start="503.729" dur="5.071">expenditures at a percent of GDP</text>
  <text start="506.099" dur="4.801">actually declined from one point four</text>
  <text start="508.8" dur="5.539">percent to one point two percent when</text>
  <text start="510.9" dur="6.03">netting out the harsh winter impact as</text>
  <text start="514.339" dur="4.721">in the real economic driver was even</text>
  <text start="516.93" dur="5.19">weaker and this time you can&amp;#39;t blame it</text>
  <text start="519.06" dur="5.07">on the weather so how did the first</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="5.1">quarter GDP rise by 0.8 percent in</text>
  <text start="524.13" dur="4.8">absolute terms of consumer spending that</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="5.429">70 percent driver of the US economy</text>
  <text start="528.93" dur="6.21">declined simple the B EA saw fit to</text>
  <text start="532.649" dur="5.43">boost the first quarter cap X fixed</text>
  <text start="535.14" dur="6.87">investment from a decline of 0.1 percent</text>
  <text start="538.079" dur="7.681">to 0.6 percent and the punchline it used</text>
  <text start="542.01" dur="6.75">the traditional GDP plug inventory even</text>
  <text start="545.76" dur="5.28">more aggressively with change in private</text>
  <text start="548.76" dur="5.79">inventories rising 0.9 percent instead</text>
  <text start="551.04" dur="5.6">of the original 0.5 percent basically</text>
  <text start="554.55" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re just manipulating the numbers</text>
  <text start="556.64" dur="6.16">again and again to convince us that we</text>
  <text start="561.42" dur="4.8">are in this fan</text>
  <text start="562.8" dur="6.529">tastic recovery but what I find very</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="6.809">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="569.329" dur="5.68">the American people they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="573.029" dur="4.16">wake up a little bit and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="575.009" dur="6.27">starting to realize there is something</text>
  <text start="577.189" dur="7.75">wrong because when we look at the</text>
  <text start="581.279" dur="6.62">Bloomberg&amp;#39;s consumer comfort index it</text>
  <text start="584.939" dur="7.171">plunged by the most in September of 2014</text>
  <text start="587.899" dur="8.38">to hover at 18 month lows basically what</text>
  <text start="592.11" dur="9.269">it&amp;#39;s saying is 70% of Americans see the</text>
  <text start="596.279" dur="7.891">state of the economy as negative now the</text>
  <text start="601.379" dur="6.541">1% of Americans see the state of economy</text>
  <text start="604.17" dur="8.75">as incredible well we know who the 1%</text>
  <text start="607.92" dur="8.579">are but the majority of people are</text>
  <text start="612.92" dur="9.129">starting to realize something just isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="616.499" dur="7.68">right I can&amp;#39;t put my finger on it the</text>
  <text start="622.049" dur="4.26">stock market doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="624.179" dur="3.061">been talking to a lot of people a lot of</text>
  <text start="626.309" dur="2.301">people that aren&amp;#39;t awaked</text>
  <text start="627.24" dur="4.409">I mean I just bring it up in</text>
  <text start="628.61" dur="4.389">conversation and we start talking about</text>
  <text start="631.649" dur="3.48">the stock market and things like that</text>
  <text start="632.999" dur="3.57">and they&amp;#39;re saying yeah something</text>
  <text start="635.129" dur="5.43">doesn&amp;#39;t seem right they keep saying</text>
  <text start="636.569" dur="7.2">earnings are down companies aren&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="640.559" dur="6.69">well businesses are laying off people we</text>
  <text start="643.769" dur="5.36">see it in the paper we see it online but</text>
  <text start="647.249" dur="6.12">the stock market keeps going up</text>
  <text start="649.129" dur="6.281">something just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense well</text>
  <text start="653.369" dur="3.66">what doesn&amp;#39;t make sense is you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="655.41" dur="5.13">make sense of manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="657.029" dur="6.09">compared to what&amp;#39;s really going on there</text>
  <text start="660.54" dur="4.259">are two different animals and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="663.119" dur="4.741">separating they&amp;#39;re going their own ways</text>
  <text start="664.799" dur="5.16">and people are starting to realize this</text>
  <text start="667.86" dur="5.459">I mean people started to realize this in</text>
  <text start="669.959" dur="5.22">2008 this is why the central bank the</text>
  <text start="673.319" dur="3.68">Fed was out there telling everyone no</text>
  <text start="675.179" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s contained</text>
  <text start="676.999" dur="6.46">we don&amp;#39;t forecast any type of recession</text>
  <text start="680.489" dur="5.25">you people are crazy you know all you</text>
  <text start="683.459" dur="3.63">crazy people talking about that the</text>
  <text start="685.739" dur="3.09">system&amp;#39;s gonna collapse</text>
  <text start="687.089" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re looking at the numbers and</text>
  <text start="688.829" dur="5.94">everything looks fine we are just fine</text>
  <text start="692.129" dur="3.861">and of course all those crazy people</text>
  <text start="694.769" dur="3.411">became</text>
  <text start="695.99" dur="5.01">the people that were right the people</text>
  <text start="698.18" dur="5.849">that knew something was wrong the people</text>
  <text start="701" dur="6.45">that was calling the government out the</text>
  <text start="704.029" dur="5.731">Fed out and saying no we&amp;#39;re gonna stick</text>
  <text start="707.45" dur="4.74">by this because we&amp;#39;re looking at real</text>
  <text start="709.76" dur="5.31">information we&amp;#39;re looking at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="712.19" dur="7.94">really going on down at the street level</text>
  <text start="715.07" dur="9.78">and something is definitely going on and</text>
  <text start="720.13" dur="7.269">of course once it all fell apart all</text>
  <text start="724.85" dur="4.859">those people and the corporate media all</text>
  <text start="727.399" dur="6.481">those people that were out there calling</text>

  <text start="744.62" dur="4.65">will get better after this little bump</text>
  <text start="746.899" dur="5.06">in the road and I remember some of the</text>

  <text start="1517.71" dur="8.43">responsible for it and of course when a</text>
  <text start="1522.45" dur="6.93">US Marine is caught going to Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1526.14" dur="5.58">they were stopped in Austria they were</text>

  <text start="1536.91" dur="4.89">didn&amp;#39;t have the special permits to go</text>
  <text start="1538.44" dur="4.77">over to Ukraine which I find very</text>
  <text start="1541.8" dur="4.5">interesting why didn&amp;#39;t they take a</text>
  <text start="1543.21" dur="7.98">military plane over to that area why</text>
  <text start="1546.3" dur="6.18">were they taking commercial flights but</text>
  <text start="1551.19" dur="5.1">we can see at this point in time they</text>
  <text start="1552.48" dur="6.89">said it was a complete oversight we</text>
  <text start="1556.29" dur="6.51">forgot to give them the clearance and we</text>
  <text start="1559.37" dur="6.07">see at this point in time that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="1562.8" dur="7.41">swept under the rug but the Russian</text>
  <text start="1565.44" dur="7.85">soldier who is allegedly in Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="1570.21" dur="5.58">being broadcasted all over the place</text>
  <text start="1573.29" dur="4.75">because what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="1575.79" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re building up the propaganda</text>
  <text start="1578.04" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re continually pushing it because</text>
  <text start="1581.28" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re really not following the Mint&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1582.57" dur="5.33">to agreement now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="1585.39" dur="6.81">United States has come out again and</text>
  <text start="1587.9" dur="7.24">imposed further sanctions against Russia</text>
  <text start="1592.2" dur="5.07">over the events in eastern Ukraine they</text>
  <text start="1595.14" dur="4.62">added 11 more people and 15 more</text>
  <text start="1597.27" dur="4.68">companies and they&amp;#39;ve been put on the</text>
  <text start="1599.76" dur="6.2">sanctions list so this shows that</text>
  <text start="1601.95" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re trying to help the peace process</text>
  <text start="1605.96" dur="6.79">know what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="1608.58" dur="9.14">they&amp;#39;re provoking Russia they want</text>
  <text start="1612.75" dur="8.01">Russia to do something the new firms are</text>

  <text start="1624" dur="5.52">linked to one of the country&amp;#39;s major</text>
  <text start="1625.83" dur="5.4">banks so we can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1629.52" dur="3.72">continually doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="1631.23" dur="5.55">u.s. has said you know what we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1633.24" dur="5.7">continually add more sanctions we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1636.78" dur="4.769">gonna provoke Russia because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1638.94" dur="3.979">responsible for all of this the US has</text>
  <text start="1641.549" dur="4.13">nothing to do with it</text>
  <text start="1642.919" dur="6.851">even though the US has advisors in their</text>

  <text start="1649.77" dur="7.44">Guard now the Regular Army bringing in</text>
  <text start="1652.049" dur="6.801">military weapons but it&amp;#39;s all Russia now</text>
  <text start="1657.21" dur="5.16">not against the United States I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1658.85" dur="5.88">against those in power making our troops</text>
  <text start="1662.37" dur="9.27">do things that make no sense</text>
  <text start="1664.73" dur="10.89">to push their personal agendas and we</text>
  <text start="1671.64" dur="7.83">can see right now the general who says</text>
  <text start="1675.62" dur="7.99">Russia is America&amp;#39;s biggest threat well</text>
  <text start="1679.47" dur="7.62">he&amp;#39;s going to replace General Martin</text>

  <text start="1687.09" dur="6.12">Marine General Joseph Dunford as the</text>
  <text start="1690.39" dur="8.3">chairman of the Joint Chiefs and we</text>
  <text start="1693.21" dur="5.48">might see things ramped up at this point</text>
  <text start="1699.02" dur="9.69">we see out in Turkey Germany is not too</text>

  <text start="1715.77" dur="5.67">thoroughly rethink this deployment and</text>
  <text start="1719.179" dur="3.521">they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1721.44" dur="3.93">following along</text>
  <text start="1722.7" dur="5.84">what Germany really wants they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1725.37" dur="4.95">criticizing the Turkish president and</text>
  <text start="1728.54" dur="6.55">they don&amp;#39;t believe they should be</text>

  <text start="1735.09" dur="7.28">understand there&amp;#39;s a certain agenda here</text>
  <text start="1737.429" dur="9.211">and we know they&amp;#39;re pushing the agenda</text>
  <text start="1742.37" dur="6.61">we see the u.s. is delivering eight f16</text>

  <text start="1927.84" dur="7.36">they&amp;#39;re continuing with the propaganda</text>

  <text start="1938.74" dur="5.879">concluded that Syria has failed to fully</text>
  <text start="1941.95" dur="6.63">and transparently account for its</text>
  <text start="1944.619" dur="6.78">arsenal and they have developed new</text>
  <text start="1948.58" dur="7.74">capabilities and are still using</text>
  <text start="1951.399" dur="8.49">chemical weapons they have just taken it</text>
  <text start="1956.32" dur="7.349">to the next level they&amp;#39;re pointing at</text>
  <text start="1959.889" dur="6.42">Syria saying yes everything that we did</text>
  <text start="1963.669" dur="4.801">was a waste of time we&amp;#39;re still coming</text>
  <text start="1966.309" dur="3.511">after you because we&amp;#39;re still using the</text>
  <text start="1968.47" dur="6.689">same propaganda that you&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="1969.82" dur="8.609">chemical weapons this is exactly what is</text>
  <text start="1975.159" dur="4.86">happening now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="1978.429" dur="4.98">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1980.019" dur="5.16">have been planning a false flag an event</text>
  <text start="1983.409" dur="3.571">that will occur here in the United</text>
  <text start="1985.179" dur="6.21">States and we know this is going to be</text>
  <text start="1986.98" dur="7.949">part of a cyber attack they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1991.389" dur="5.701">leading up to this even this is part of</text>
  <text start="1994.929" dur="4.291">their agenda to pass legislation but</text>
  <text start="1997.09" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s also to continually keep everyone</text>
  <text start="1999.22" dur="6.179">informed that this is coming sooner or</text>
  <text start="2002.19" dur="5.489">later and we see that they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="2005.399" dur="5.52">that US military bases are at risk for a</text>
  <text start="2007.679" dur="5.85">cyber attack against the bases PowerGrid</text>
  <text start="2010.919" dur="4.671">and other utility systems just like here</text>
  <text start="2013.529" dur="4.89">in the main parts of the United States</text>
  <text start="2015.59" dur="4.12">according to a new report of the defense</text>

  <text start="2028.379" dur="4.01">occur it would knock them out</text>
  <text start="2032.879" dur="5.23">so you can see where we&amp;#39;re headed right</text>
  <text start="2034.989" dur="5.52">here now we understand something most</text>
  <text start="2038.109" dur="3.66">likely will happen coming up this August</text>

  <text start="2043.33" dur="4.289">Day indicators are definitely pointing</text>
  <text start="2045.46" dur="4.08">to this and normally what we see is some</text>
  <text start="2047.619" dur="4.68">type of advisory warning we saw this</text>
  <text start="2049.54" dur="5.129">back in 2014 we saw it back in 2013 and</text>
  <text start="2052.299" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;re getting our first advisory warning</text>
  <text start="2054.669" dur="6.15">now the US has issued a worldwide travel</text>
  <text start="2058.059" dur="4.681">caution for citizens and this is</text>
  <text start="2060.819" dur="3.57">including India because we know that it</text>

  <text start="2066.579" dur="6.78">to come in and attack us because we want</text>
  <text start="2068.74" dur="8.569">war so they sent out this warning</text>
  <text start="2073.359" dur="6.29">because of these increased threats</text>
  <text start="2077.309" dur="4.57">coming from the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="2079.649" dur="5.17">they&amp;#39;re saying because of all these</text>

  <text start="2091.26" dur="9.67">Europe it could be the UK the US and</text>
  <text start="2097.92" dur="6.939">right now they have this advisory that</text>
  <text start="2100.93" dur="5.85">just went up so this tells us they are</text>
  <text start="2104.859" dur="4.26">definitely planning something that fits</text>
  <text start="2106.78" dur="4.74">into the indicators and we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="2109.119" dur="3.421">to watch this situation very carefully</text>
