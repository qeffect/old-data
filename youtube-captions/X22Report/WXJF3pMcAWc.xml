  <text start="53.57" dur="4.59">hi and welcome you listening to the X</text>
  <text start="56.69" dur="5.07">when it&amp;#39;s your report my name is Dave</text>
  <text start="58.16" dur="6.87">and this is episode 1586 a and today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="61.76" dur="6.15">date is June 7th 2018 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="65.03" dur="5.28">episode is the move away from the euro</text>
  <text start="67.91" dur="5.61">has begun Italy looking at parallel</text>
  <text start="70.31" dur="5.669">currencies let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.52" dur="5.13">collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="75.979" dur="5.011">understand and we know that the central</text>
  <text start="78.65" dur="5.13">bankers they need control over</text>
  <text start="80.99" dur="7.08">everything everything that has to do</text>
  <text start="83.78" dur="8.43">with the creation of currency and with</text>
  <text start="88.07" dur="6.06">cryptocurrency with fiat currency they</text>
  <text start="92.21" dur="2.7">want complete and utter control actually</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="3.18">they don&amp;#39;t want anyone using</text>
  <text start="94.91" dur="3.959">cryptocurrency whatsoever they want a</text>
  <text start="97.31" dur="4.32">centralized system and if they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="98.869" dur="5.401">use any type of cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="101.63" dur="4.739">they want complete and utter control but</text>
  <text start="104.27" dur="4.739">it&amp;#39;s very difficult in a decentralized</text>
  <text start="106.369" dur="4.951">system so what they would like to do is</text>
  <text start="109.009" dur="4.47">they would like to have a centralized</text>
  <text start="111.32" dur="5.49">system and I think this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="113.479" dur="6.811">trying to move into where they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="116.81" dur="6.449">to have governments regulators regulate</text>
  <text start="120.29" dur="4.619">the crypto market now some people say</text>
  <text start="123.259" dur="3.211">this is going to be great some other</text>
  <text start="124.909" dur="3.781">people are say this is not going to be</text>
  <text start="126.47" dur="4.829">so great but what we see happening right</text>
  <text start="128.69" dur="6.45">now is that coinbase and remember</text>
  <text start="131.299" dur="6.931">coinbase handed over information to the</text>
  <text start="135.14" dur="5.4">IRS so people could be taxed on their</text>
  <text start="138.23" dur="4.38">crypto trades now it doesn&amp;#39;t mean they</text>
  <text start="140.54" dur="5.34">traded one crypto for another it&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="142.61" dur="4.11">they cashed out into US dollars coin</text>
  <text start="145.88" dur="3.66">base right now</text>
  <text start="146.72" dur="4.92">they have initiated the process to</text>
  <text start="149.54" dur="3.3">become a fully regulated broker dealer</text>
  <text start="151.64" dur="4.29">by the US Securities and Exchange</text>
  <text start="152.84" dur="5.39">Commission and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="155.93" dur="5.91">moving in the direction to become a</text>
  <text start="158.23" dur="5.68">regulated broker dealer and basically</text>
  <text start="161.84" dur="5.04">all information will be then handed over</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="6.2">to the IRS now again this is not a</text>
  <text start="166.88" dur="5.699">decentralized exchange this is a</text>
  <text start="170.11" dur="5.5">centralized exchange with a</text>
  <text start="172.579" dur="5.521">decentralized exchange which there is</text>
  <text start="175.61" dur="5.909">not many out there as of yet but soon</text>
  <text start="178.1" dur="7.38">there will be just like the internet how</text>
  <text start="181.519" dur="5.241">that basically went from Internet 1.0</text>
  <text start="185.48" dur="3.74">where you</text>
  <text start="186.76" dur="4.759">dial up and get into it this is the</text>
  <text start="189.22" dur="6.45">beginning stages of the crypto</text>
  <text start="191.519" dur="7.091">revolution this is going to go way</text>
  <text start="195.67" dur="6.09">beyond what anyone or anyone can even</text>
  <text start="198.61" dur="4.5">think of as time goes on and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.76" dur="3.69">gonna be so many different industries</text>
  <text start="203.11" dur="3.989">using it it&amp;#39;s going to be mind-boggling</text>
  <text start="205.45" dur="4.77">almost like the Internet no one could</text>
  <text start="207.099" dur="6.36">ever think of the internet being on a</text>
  <text start="210.22" dur="5.93">handheld phone where you can just swipe</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="5.881">and touch the screen and do your banking</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="6.61">you can purchase items you can surf the</text>
  <text start="219.34" dur="5.399">web you can do pretty much everything on</text>
  <text start="222.76" dur="4.349">that little device the same thing is</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="4.62">gonna happen with crypto currencies with</text>
  <text start="227.109" dur="3.78">the blockchain technology and if you</text>
  <text start="229.359" dur="4.291">want to learn more about this you can go</text>
  <text start="230.889" dur="6.331">to the x-22 Report school comm you can</text>
  <text start="233.65" dur="6.179">learn how crypto currencies work or you</text>
  <text start="237.22" dur="4.95">can join the trading room and you can</text>
  <text start="239.829" dur="4.681">watch traders trade the crypto</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="4.679">currencies go to the website read what</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="4.86">they have to say read the information</text>
  <text start="246.849" dur="6.42">there and you can join either one of</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="7.41">them or both if you like now we see that</text>
  <text start="253.269" dur="6.81">the u.s. they are placing tariffs on all</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="6.66">different countries Canada the EU Mexico</text>
  <text start="260.079" dur="5.851">and Putin is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="263.44" dur="4.47">that all these terror tariffs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="4.98">pretty much the same as economic</text>
  <text start="267.91" dur="6.06">sanctions in disguise and I kind of</text>
  <text start="270.91" dur="4.89">agree with him the tariffs are sanctions</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="4.44">on all these countries now all of this</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="5.91">is being done on purpose there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="278.41" dur="7.47">reason why all this is happening because</text>
  <text start="281.71" dur="7.47">what is happening here is these deals</text>
  <text start="285.88" dur="4.95">that were created in the past NAFTA TPP</text>
  <text start="289.18" dur="3.75">which is struck down already the TTIP</text>
  <text start="290.83" dur="3.72">which is really not going anywhere</text>
  <text start="292.93" dur="5.07">because the u.s. is not really involved</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="6.42">these were created by the globalist this</text>
  <text start="298" dur="5.31">was for a one world system and this was</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="5.22">the beginning stages of it TPP was gonna</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="5.34">really bring us into that realm of a</text>
  <text start="306.19" dur="5.67">one-world government one world currency</text>
  <text start="308.65" dur="4.949">and what Trump and the Patriots what</text>
  <text start="311.86" dur="4.429">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.599" dur="5.04">trying to break this apart this is why</text>
  <text start="316.289" dur="4.421">Trump went after NAFTA right in the</text>
  <text start="318.639" dur="4.801">beginning even though it&amp;#39;s tied up</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="4.8">Congress and is very difficult to</text>
  <text start="323.44" dur="3.75">unravel this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.51" dur="3">renegotiating right now but I think</text>
  <text start="327.19" dur="2.91">what&amp;#39;s gonna happen is eventually</text>
  <text start="328.51" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to go and basically</text>
  <text start="330.1" dur="4.65">just cancel the whole damn thing</text>
  <text start="332.05" dur="5.58">just like TPP because it doesn&amp;#39;t benefit</text>
  <text start="334.75" dur="6.93">the American people and the reason why</text>
  <text start="337.63" dur="5.67">all these tariffs or sanctions whatever</text>
  <text start="341.68" dur="3.48">you want to call them are being placed</text>
  <text start="343.3" dur="4.38">in all these different countries is to</text>
  <text start="345.16" dur="6.45">basically make all these countries</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="6.3">buckle under the pressure and rework all</text>
  <text start="351.61" dur="5.31">these deals we need new trade deals</text>
  <text start="353.98" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re moving into a new system the</text>
  <text start="356.92" dur="4.08">system that we&amp;#39;re in right now is a</text>
  <text start="358.66" dur="4.2">central banking system it&amp;#39;s based off</text>
  <text start="361" dur="4.76">the Federal Reserve Note the petro</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="5.55">dollar which was created in 1971 and</text>
  <text start="365.76" dur="4.78">we&amp;#39;ve been using this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="368.41" dur="4.38">and people have gotten used to it people</text>
  <text start="370.54" dur="5.73">think debt is wealth and you know the</text>
  <text start="372.79" dur="7.26">whole type of thinking about the economy</text>
  <text start="376.27" dur="6.06">is a central banking thinking model we</text>
  <text start="380.05" dur="4.77">need to get out of this this is why</text>
  <text start="382.33" dur="5.49">bilateral trades are being worked on</text>
  <text start="384.82" dur="4.95">this is why we see China they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="387.82" dur="4.74">the belt and road which is the Silk Road</text>
  <text start="389.77" dur="5.78">and we can see that there&amp;#39;s a new system</text>
  <text start="392.56" dur="6.54">being formed while the old system is</text>
  <text start="395.55" dur="5.56">being destroyed and that is what is</text>
  <text start="399.1" dur="5.31">happening right now the old system is</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="5.31">being destroyed to make room for this</text>
  <text start="404.41" dur="5.19">new system and the only way to do that</text>
  <text start="406.42" dur="6">is to bring the whole system down think</text>
  <text start="409.6" dur="6.03">about what the whole system supports it</text>
  <text start="412.42" dur="6">supports the central bankers it supports</text>
  <text start="415.63" dur="6.06">Wall Street it supports the deep state</text>
  <text start="418.42" dur="7.05">it supports all of this if you destroy</text>
  <text start="421.69" dur="6.93">the source of where all this comes from</text>
  <text start="425.47" dur="5.13">you destroy all of it and where does it</text>
  <text start="428.62" dur="4.41">come from it comes from the central</text>
  <text start="430.6" dur="5.37">banks it comes from the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="433.03" dur="7.44">it comes from the IMF it comes from the</text>
  <text start="435.97" dur="6.81">biz they&amp;#39;ve taken over the world I mean</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="5.79">this is what they&amp;#39;ve done they&amp;#39;ve taken</text>
  <text start="442.78" dur="6.15">over the creation of currency for almost</text>
  <text start="446.26" dur="5.64">the entire world and they put countries</text>
  <text start="448.93" dur="5.13">into debt they have full control but we</text>
  <text start="451.9" dur="2.4">see this completely breaking up right</text>
  <text start="454.06" dur="2.36">now</text>
  <text start="454.3" dur="5.28">we see there are many many problems and</text>
  <text start="456.42" dur="5.17">countries well they realize that all</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="4.2">this debt is not helping their country</text>
  <text start="461.59" dur="4.53">Italy for instance they&amp;#39;re in a big</text>
  <text start="463.78" dur="4.47">Durham big trouble right now and with</text>
  <text start="466.12" dur="4.89">their new leadership they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="468.25" dur="6.72">go in a different direction and we can</text>
  <text start="471.01" dur="8.81">see that Italy in the past they proposed</text>
  <text start="474.97" dur="8.37">for maybe a parallel currency system now</text>
  <text start="479.82" dur="5.35">this was exposed how Italy they were</text>
  <text start="483.34" dur="5.55">planning to print the lira</text>
  <text start="485.17" dur="7.17">but EU back president destroyed the bid</text>
  <text start="488.89" dur="6.21">to oust the euro and they were planning</text>
  <text start="492.34" dur="5.58">on this plan B where they were going to</text>
  <text start="495.1" dur="5.4">have a parallel currency and they might</text>
  <text start="497.92" dur="6.21">have they might have gone from the Euro</text>
  <text start="500.5" dur="6.78">and moved into the lira and we can see</text>
  <text start="504.13" dur="6.95">that that plan didn&amp;#39;t work out but Italy</text>
  <text start="507.28" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;re thinking about another plan and</text>
  <text start="511.08" dur="5.71">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this</text>
  <text start="514.48" dur="5.58">might be the biggest threat to the euro</text>
  <text start="516.79" dur="6.51">zone now former busy f-- economist</text>
  <text start="520.06" dur="6.93">William white said this is how this</text>
  <text start="523.3" dur="6.63">whole thing might unfold the trigger for</text>
  <text start="526.99" dur="5.58">a crisis could be anything if the system</text>
  <text start="529.93" dur="5.13">as a whole is unstable</text>
  <text start="532.57" dur="5.4">moreover the size of the trigger event</text>
  <text start="535.06" dur="5.76">need not bear any relation to the</text>
  <text start="537.97" dur="4.8">systemic outcome the lesson is that</text>
  <text start="540.82" dur="4.59">policymakers should be focused less on</text>
  <text start="542.77" dur="4.89">identifying potential triggers than on</text>
  <text start="545.41" dur="5.76">identifying signs of potential</text>
  <text start="547.66" dur="7.04">instability now bill says the financial</text>
  <text start="551.17" dur="6.57">system is so fragile that practically</text>
  <text start="554.7" dur="5.05">anything could trigger a crisis better</text>
  <text start="557.74" dur="4.35">to watch for the signs of potential</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="7.7">instability and one of the hotspots</text>
  <text start="562.09" dur="8.25">today is Italy italy&amp;#39;s new government</text>
  <text start="567.45" dur="6.04">this is an unexpected coalition between</text>
  <text start="570.34" dur="6.12">two populist parties could blow up the</text>
  <text start="573.49" dur="5.01">fragile trust that keeps Europe together</text>
  <text start="576.46" dur="4.53">and the leading parties may even be</text>
  <text start="578.5" dur="6.21">planning for it the discussion between</text>
  <text start="580.99" dur="6">lega Nord and five star included an idea</text>
  <text start="584.71" dur="3.4">called the minibot that would</text>
  <text start="586.99" dur="5.05">effectively serve</text>
  <text start="588.11" dur="7.289">as a parallel currency now the bot is</text>
  <text start="592.04" dur="5.7">Italy&amp;#39;s Treasury bill and as in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="595.399" dur="5.341">it serves as a kind of cash equivalent</text>
  <text start="597.74" dur="5.219">in electronic trading the minibot would</text>
  <text start="600.74" dur="4.589">be a government debt instrument in paper</text>
  <text start="602.959" dur="5.041">form that pays zero interest and never</text>
  <text start="605.329" dur="4.44">ensures the government would use it to</text>
  <text start="608" dur="4.41">pay social benefits and accept it for</text>
  <text start="609.769" dur="4.831">tax payments private businesses would</text>
  <text start="612.41" dur="4.619">not be would not be required to accept</text>
  <text start="614.6" dur="4.799">it but they could private businesses and</text>
  <text start="617.029" dur="4.081">individuals would also in theory buy</text>
  <text start="619.399" dur="3.721">them in e-bot as a way to pay their</text>
  <text start="621.11" dur="3.9">taxes but they would buy them at a</text>
  <text start="623.12" dur="4.469">discount so traders would immediately</text>
  <text start="625.01" dur="4.53">set up an arbitrage where the person</text>
  <text start="627.589" dur="5.131">getting the social social benefits</text>
  <text start="629.54" dur="8.43">payment could sell them for euros for</text>
  <text start="632.72" dur="9.51">call it a 5% or 10% haircut and they are</text>
  <text start="637.97" dur="7.799">pushing this idea to move away from the</text>
  <text start="642.23" dur="6">euro now if they do this which they</text>
  <text start="645.769" dur="4.861">might because they keep saying Italy</text>
  <text start="648.23" dur="5.52">first they&amp;#39;re getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="650.63" dur="6.449">refugees within their country if they do</text>
  <text start="653.75" dur="6.6">this and other Mediterranean countries</text>
  <text start="657.079" dur="6.901">see this they&amp;#39;re going to move in the</text>
  <text start="660.35" dur="7.4">same direction and this might be the</text>
  <text start="663.98" dur="7.59">trigger that brings down the fragile</text>
  <text start="667.75" dur="7.149">global economy because we know that this</text>
  <text start="671.57" dur="6.66">economy it&amp;#39;s based on an illusion it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="674.899" dur="6.81">based on fake data it&amp;#39;s baked it&amp;#39;s based</text>
  <text start="678.23" dur="7.89">on a central banking model system that</text>
  <text start="681.709" dur="5.791">implodes every 40 to 45 years and one</text>
  <text start="686.12" dur="4.17">little thing can bring the whole thing</text>
  <text start="687.5" dur="4.74">down this is what central bankers mostly</text>
  <text start="690.29" dur="4.35">worried about they worried about</text>
  <text start="692.24" dur="4.62">something coming out of left field that</text>
  <text start="694.64" dur="2.99">they didn&amp;#39;t expect that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="696.86" dur="2.58">control</text>
  <text start="697.63" dur="4.209">just like here in the United States</text>
  <text start="699.44" dur="5.79">their main problem here in the United</text>
  <text start="701.839" dur="6">States is they can print currency no</text>
  <text start="705.23" dur="4.859">problem they can prop up the banking</text>
  <text start="707.839" dur="5.25">system no problem they can manipulate</text>
  <text start="710.089" dur="5.041">the stock market no problem they can</text>
  <text start="713.089" dur="5.101">manipulate the interest rates no problem</text>
  <text start="715.13" dur="5.769">the one thing they can&amp;#39;t do here is make</text>

  <text start="822.059" dur="4.58">everyone else is telling you how great</text>
  <text start="823.199" dur="8.13">the market is I mean I can think back to</text>
  <text start="826.639" dur="7.601">2006 2007 where I was where people were</text>
  <text start="831.329" dur="4.74">selling their homes and they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="834.24" dur="3.959">get anyone to look at their house they</text>
  <text start="836.069" dur="3.81">couldn&amp;#39;t get anyone to come but if you</text>
  <text start="838.199" dur="4.23">listen to the corporate media they were</text>
  <text start="839.879" dur="3.71">telling you how great it was and they</text>
  <text start="842.429" dur="3.78">said this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="843.589" dur="3.94">nobody&amp;#39;s coming and they started</text>
  <text start="846.209" dur="4.5">lowering their prices and still nobody</text>
  <text start="847.529" dur="6.24">was coming and just maybe six eight</text>
  <text start="850.709" dur="4.141">months before that there were tons of</text>
  <text start="853.769" dur="3.571">people</text>
  <text start="854.85" dur="3.66">and it just all dried up but the</text>
  <text start="857.34" dur="2.36">corporate media and everyone else was</text>
  <text start="858.51" dur="4.17">telling you that it was great that</text>
  <text start="859.7" dur="5.8">prices are continually rising everything</text>
  <text start="862.68" dur="6.27">is fantastic and then we come to learn</text>
  <text start="865.5" dur="5.16">the whole thing was breaking down this</text>
  <text start="868.95" dur="4.05">is what&amp;#39;s happening right now the whole</text>
  <text start="870.66" dur="5.13">thing is breaking down in countries are</text>
  <text start="873" dur="6.53">looking for an escape route they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="875.79" dur="6.99">looking to protect themselves and</text>
  <text start="879.53" dur="6.55">everything is going to change we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="882.78" dur="6.12">already seeing the changes we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="886.08" dur="5.22">seeing the globalists at work anymore</text>
  <text start="888.9" dur="5.49">because if that was true TPP would have</text>
  <text start="891.3" dur="6.98">been passed TTIP would have been passed</text>
  <text start="894.39" dur="7.2">the belton road that would never exist</text>
  <text start="898.28" dur="6.22">under the globalist system that would be</text>
  <text start="901.59" dur="6.9">squashed and pushed down really really</text>
  <text start="904.5" dur="5.31">hard the central bank&amp;#39;s they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="908.49" dur="2.64">worry about anything they would they</text>
  <text start="909.81" dur="4.8">wouldn&amp;#39;t care because they knew they</text>
  <text start="911.13" dur="5.97">were in control and we would see</text>
  <text start="914.61" dur="6.18">illegals pouring into this country</text>
  <text start="917.1" dur="7.11">because they&amp;#39;d have to basically blend</text>
  <text start="920.79" dur="6">and even out every single country so</text>
  <text start="924.21" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s no difference in the amount of</text>
  <text start="926.79" dur="5.46">pay and of course the United States the</text>
  <text start="929.61" dur="4.29">the pay is quite high compared to other</text>
  <text start="932.25" dur="3.93">countries so they&amp;#39;re not going to bring</text>
  <text start="933.9" dur="3.78">other countries up to the level of the</text>
  <text start="936.18" dur="3.87">United States they were going to bring</text>
  <text start="937.68" dur="5.13">the United States down to the level of</text>
  <text start="940.05" dur="6.33">other countries so you can have cross</text>
  <text start="942.81" dur="7.59">workers in any country getting the same</text>
  <text start="946.38" dur="7.71">exact pay this is the model they wanted</text>
  <text start="950.4" dur="7.05">we don&amp;#39;t see that right now we see the</text>
  <text start="954.09" dur="4.44">opposite happening we see TPP struck</text>
  <text start="957.45" dur="3.9">down TTIP</text>
  <text start="958.53" dur="5.49">not going anywhere the belt and road the</text>
  <text start="961.35" dur="6.11">Silk Road building we searing more and</text>
  <text start="964.02" dur="8.22">more countries move to China Russia</text>
  <text start="967.46" dur="7.21">dealing outside of the dollar we see</text>
  <text start="972.24" dur="4.68">here in the United States the hundred</text>
  <text start="974.67" dur="4.38">dollar bill half of it is the Federal</text>
  <text start="976.92" dur="6.45">Reserve Note the other half is the US</text>
  <text start="979.05" dur="7.08">Treasury and it&amp;#39;s gold and it tells you</text>
  <text start="983.37" dur="4.75">how to overthrow your government there</text>
  <text start="986.13" dur="5.98">are changes changes</text>
  <text start="988.12" dur="5.969">opening if you look for them I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="992.11" dur="3.9">not gonna be on the corporate media it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="994.089" dur="3.271">not gonna be in the newspapers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="996.01" dur="3.09">not gonna tell you any of this just like</text>
  <text start="997.36" dur="4.05">going back to the 70s they didn&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="999.1" dur="4.05">you hey by the way the reason why we</text>
  <text start="1001.41" dur="3.03">have oil shortages because we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="1003.15" dur="3.87">off the gold center right now you guys</text>

  <text start="1009.33" dur="3.72">central bank we&amp;#39;re gonna take it off the</text>
  <text start="1010.8" dur="4.44">checks and balances of gold and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1013.05" dur="4.08">gonna remove that but we&amp;#39;re gonna lie to</text>
  <text start="1015.24" dur="4.59">you to say that there&amp;#39;s speculators and</text>
  <text start="1017.13" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re removing the currency</text>
  <text start="1019.83" dur="4.56">off the gold standard and also that them</text>
  <text start="1022.86" dur="5.099">then we&amp;#39;re gonna take the currency and</text>
  <text start="1024.39" dur="5.4">hook it to oil out in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1027.959" dur="4.021">and we promise them that we will protect</text>
  <text start="1029.79" dur="4.98">them and if anyone tries to invade those</text>

  <text start="1084.99" dur="5.52">moving away from the global system but</text>
  <text start="1087.929" dur="6.271">the only way to completely get out of it</text>
