  <text start="61.59" dur="5.31">December 28th 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="64.62" dur="5.63">the episode is Russia presents evidence</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="5.91">against the Cabal and repeats their call</text>
  <text start="70.25" dur="5.5">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="5.97">political and geopolitical news now it</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="5.64">looks like Obamacare is not doing as</text>
  <text start="78.78" dur="4.35">well as the corporate media wants</text>
  <text start="81.39" dur="4.68">everyone to think and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="83.13" dur="4.98">tracking Obamacare where we know that</text>
  <text start="86.07" dur="4.38">the enrollment is going down because</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="4.68">premiums are going up the exchanges what</text>
  <text start="90.45" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re going bankrupt and we can see</text>
  <text start="92.79" dur="3.27">that a lot of people are starting to</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="4.71">realize that this system this health</text>
  <text start="96.06" dur="4.559">care system is not a very good system</text>
  <text start="98.55" dur="4.17">right now they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="100.619" dur="3.931">eight point seven million people that</text>
  <text start="102.72" dur="5.55">enrolled in health care health care</text>
  <text start="104.55" dur="6.45">plans for 2018 using the marketplace for</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="5.4">Obama care and this is actually quite</text>
  <text start="111" dur="4.08">low now remember when Obamacare came</text>
  <text start="113.67" dur="2.85">online it was though all those people</text>
  <text start="115.08" dur="3.72">that already health had health insurance</text>
  <text start="116.52" dur="4.8">those people who are Medicare Medicaid</text>
  <text start="118.8" dur="5.49">they just you know moved over to this</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="4.92">new system and it looks like from the</text>
  <text start="124.29" dur="4.859">height you know where they were getting</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="4.98">12 15 million people to join it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="3.241">declining every single year if we go</text>
  <text start="131.22" dur="3.36">back to 2016</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="5.79">there was 11.5 million people that were</text>
  <text start="134.58" dur="7.35">enrolled in Obamacare now in the year of</text>
  <text start="138.18" dur="6.839">2016 going into 2017 we can see that it</text>
  <text start="141.93" dur="6">has dropped to 9 2.2 million and here we</text>
  <text start="145.019" dur="4.921">are at 8.7 million and again these</text>
  <text start="147.93" dur="3.24">numbers will be revised once again</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="4.019">because when people start getting the</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="4.47">bills for Obama care next year they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="153.959" dur="3.75">gonna start dropping out so this number</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="4.8">is going to drop even further and what</text>
  <text start="157.709" dur="4.59">this tells us is that Obama care is just</text>
  <text start="160.44" dur="5.28">too expensive for the everyday person</text>
  <text start="162.299" dur="5.671">and if we really want to show government</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="4.68">that we we we really don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="167.97" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s like any other product if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="2.309">want a certain product what do you do</text>
  <text start="171.63" dur="3.03">you don&amp;#39;t buy it</text>
  <text start="172.709" dur="4.081">then the corporation realizes no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.66" dur="5.52">buying this product product nobody wants</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="6.03">it same thing with government products</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="4.619">that&amp;#39;s what this really is if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="182.82" dur="3.99">go ahead and we don&amp;#39;t go and purchase</text>
  <text start="184.799" dur="4.41">this it shows the government that</text>
  <text start="186.81" dur="5.36">yeah we don&amp;#39;t want this because if this</text>
  <text start="189.209" dur="6.811">number drops to two three million people</text>
  <text start="192.17" dur="6.039">then they say well look we have the real</text>
  <text start="196.02" dur="4.71">numbers here people don&amp;#39;t want it look</text>
  <text start="198.209" dur="3.301">how low it&amp;#39;s gotten it&amp;#39;s ridiculous it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="3.33">not working</text>
  <text start="201.51" dur="5.49">that people have spoken this is how we</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="6.3">get our message across this is how we</text>
  <text start="207" dur="4.68">tell them it&amp;#39;s not for us and we could</text>
  <text start="210.36" dur="3.09">see that message is coming through</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="4.05">because every single year it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="4.14">continually declining where people are</text>
  <text start="215.73" dur="4.55">saying now this is not good we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="6.95">need this we can see that the entire</text>
  <text start="220.28" dur="7.87">Trump Russian probe is a complete sham</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="6.52">Mueller isn&amp;#39;t even investigating ties to</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="5.399">Russia Russian collusion anymore he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.06" dur="7.2">not even doing that what is he doing</text>
  <text start="233.549" dur="7.951">what is he looking for well he is using</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="5.61">a form of financial terrorism to</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="4.41">bankrupt Trump associates with</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="4.56">white-collar crime investigations that</text>
  <text start="245.91" dur="5.93">have absolutely no connection to the</text>
  <text start="248.43" dur="5.58">2016 election much less Russia and</text>
  <text start="251.84" dur="3.94">Muller he&amp;#39;s assembled a team of</text>
  <text start="254.01" dur="3.979">prosecutors with expertise in handling</text>
  <text start="255.78" dur="5.579">financial investigations and</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="4.871">white-collar crime and obtained guilty</text>
  <text start="261.359" dur="5.191">place for crimes that were committed</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="5.88">during the election year so as we can</text>
  <text start="266.55" dur="3.75">see with mana Ford and the rest he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.74" dur="3.6">going in a completely different</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="4.53">direction and this whole Russian</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="4.32">collusion thing is completely made-up</text>
  <text start="274.83" dur="4.5">and you could see this has nothing</text>
  <text start="276.66" dur="4.71">nothing to do about Russian hacking the</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="4.14">u.s. elections but rather about</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="4.71">attempting to tie up former Trump</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="5.28">associates with charges that have</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="4.83">nothing to do with the election or even</text>
  <text start="288.75" dur="4.53">Trump in general with the hope that they</text>
  <text start="290.91" dur="4.89">will eventually turn on the President</text>
  <text start="293.28" dur="5.25">and give them information that they can</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="4.589">use this is the strategy that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.53" dur="4.92">using right now will it work</text>
  <text start="300.389" dur="4.771">most likely not out in Israel we see</text>
  <text start="303.45" dur="3.689">things are really heating up there the</text>
  <text start="305.16" dur="3.81">original police conclude their</text>
  <text start="307.139" dur="6.211">corruption and the investigation against</text>
  <text start="308.97" dur="6.89">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and we</text>
  <text start="313.35" dur="6.25">see that there are many different</text>
  <text start="315.86" dur="7.28">indictments against him</text>
  <text start="319.6" dur="5.64">his family other people in his</text>
  <text start="323.14" dur="6.45">administration and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="325.24" dur="7.2">is that when these come out in 2018 and</text>
  <text start="329.59" dur="6.18">might be as soon as May 2018 it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="4.77">to be earth-shattering and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="335.77" dur="3.36">seeing right now is that these</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="4.38">indictment recommendations will bear a</text>
  <text start="339.13" dur="5.16">lot of information that we didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="341.59" dur="4.83">and it will cause an earthquake here</text>
  <text start="344.29" dur="4.68">this is coming from Israel</text>
  <text start="346.42" dur="4.86">now Netanyahu is accused of offering to</text>
  <text start="348.97" dur="4.62">pass legislation favorable to a</text>
  <text start="351.28" dur="4.47">newspaper publisher in exchange for</text>
  <text start="353.59" dur="4.47">favorable coverage however the bill</text>
  <text start="355.75" dur="3.63">never passed another case involving</text>
  <text start="358.06" dur="3.45">bribery related to the purchase of</text>
  <text start="359.38" dur="5.07">submarines from Germany and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="361.51" dur="4.62">involve Netanyahu however at least two</text>
  <text start="364.45" dur="4.02">of his confidence are under</text>
  <text start="366.13" dur="5.76">investigation for suspicion of</text>
  <text start="368.47" dur="6.15">wrongdoing his wife Sarah is mired in</text>
  <text start="371.89" dur="4.89">three legal disputes two involving the</text>
  <text start="374.62" dur="3.96">receipt of illegal gifts and favors from</text>
  <text start="376.78" dur="5.13">businessman exchange for advancing their</text>
  <text start="378.58" dur="6.15">interest in another case she&amp;#39;s accused</text>
  <text start="381.91" dur="5.79">of fraudulently receiving about $100,000</text>
  <text start="384.73" dur="4.68">for her participation in a scam to order</text>
  <text start="387.7" dur="3.84">meals at Israel&amp;#39;s expense without</text>
  <text start="389.41" dur="4.32">authorization and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="391.54" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s a lot more charger so we can see</text>
  <text start="393.73" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s a lot happening out in the world</text>
  <text start="396.31" dur="3.51">today especially in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="3.42">Israel and many different places and</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see how this play</text>
  <text start="401.53" dur="7.83">plays out and this might cause elections</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="6.93">to occur in Israel and Netanyahu might</text>
  <text start="409.36" dur="6.63">be ousted and there might be a someone</text>
  <text start="412.24" dur="5.58">else completely different in office so</text>
  <text start="415.99" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="3.99">because we could see everything in the</text>
  <text start="419.71" dur="4.56">Middle East is completely changing right</text>
  <text start="421.81" dur="5.22">now Kiev is planning to hold regular</text>
  <text start="424.27" dur="8.21">mobilization in early 2018 and as we</text>
  <text start="427.03" dur="8.34">know the u.s. is providing Kiev with</text>
  <text start="432.48" dur="5.64">lethal well some people say lethal some</text>
  <text start="435.37" dur="7.83">people say non-lethal this was already</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="8.02">created and signed off by Obama this is</text>
  <text start="443.2" dur="5.43">the Ukrainian Freedom Act and I believe</text>
  <text start="446.14" dur="4.65">this was being used to get those</text>
  <text start="448.63" dur="4.8">individuals to vote for the tax plan and</text>
  <text start="450.79" dur="5.4">what is going to be sent over to Ukraine</text>
  <text start="453.43" dur="4.56">is not going to be worth that much it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.19" dur="4.2">not going to change anything it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="5.67">going to help Ukrainian forces it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="460.39" dur="5.91">gonna do what John McCain Lindsey Graham</text>
  <text start="463.66" dur="4.5">and the rest want they think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.3" dur="3.54">gonna be getting all these weapons and</text>
  <text start="468.16" dur="4.14">all these things and they&amp;#39;re gonna win</text>
  <text start="469.84" dur="4.98">over the southeastern people but I think</text>
  <text start="472.3" dur="4.29">what is happening is what it would but</text>
  <text start="474.82" dur="4.5">going to be shipped over there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.59" dur="5.07">going to be so miniscule that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="479.32" dur="5.07">gonna do anything and I think what Trump</text>
  <text start="481.66" dur="4.38">has done here is he&amp;#39;s convinced them</text>
  <text start="484.39" dur="4.1">that yeah listen if you vote for my tax</text>
  <text start="486.04" dur="5.97">plan I will send some stuff over there</text>
  <text start="488.49" dur="5.37">now again what stuff is he gonna be</text>
  <text start="492.01" dur="5.28">sending over there we&amp;#39;ll have to say</text>
  <text start="493.86" dur="6.52">right now we see there&amp;#39;s you know sniper</text>
  <text start="497.29" dur="6.18">rifles we see maybe anti-tank guns</text>
  <text start="500.38" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s not signed off as of yet and even</text>
  <text start="503.47" dur="3.93">if they do if they sent over one two</text>
  <text start="504.97" dur="4.83">three four five ten that is not going to</text>
  <text start="507.4" dur="4.61">change anything in Ukraine because you</text>
  <text start="509.8" dur="4.97">have to remember go back in time the</text>
  <text start="512.01" dur="6.43">United States has been supplying</text>
  <text start="514.77" dur="6.37">weaponry all along to Kiev covertly</text>
  <text start="518.44" dur="4.95">and on the books they&amp;#39;ve also had</text>
  <text start="521.14" dur="4.29">soldiers there training</text>
  <text start="523.39" dur="5.88">Ukrainian forces now they&amp;#39;ve tried many</text>
  <text start="525.43" dur="7.65">attempts to go into southeastern Ukraine</text>
  <text start="529.27" dur="6.63">and it didn&amp;#39;t work those people there</text>
  <text start="533.08" dur="5.52">fought back and pushed Ukrainian army</text>
  <text start="535.9" dur="4.74">and was a complete disaster for the</text>
  <text start="538.6" dur="4.41">Ukrainian army there was one point where</text>
  <text start="540.64" dur="4.19">they were pushing them back so far they</text>
  <text start="543.01" dur="4.71">could have taken over the entire country</text>
  <text start="544.83" dur="5.23">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this</text>
  <text start="547.72" dur="5.61">is their last-ditch attempt and they</text>
  <text start="550.06" dur="4.65">think by voting for this tax plan that</text>
  <text start="553.33" dur="3.33">all these weapons are going to be</text>
  <text start="554.71" dur="3.42">delivered to Ukraine and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="556.66" dur="3.84">turn the tides but I think what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="558.13" dur="4.59">to happen here is the weapons that are</text>
  <text start="560.5" dur="4.38">going to be delivered or maybe you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="562.72" dur="4.8">get caught up in red tape and it will</text>
  <text start="564.88" dur="5.34">never be delivered I think Trump played</text>
  <text start="567.52" dur="4.53">them to get their vote on the tax deal</text>
  <text start="570.22" dur="4.38">and I think that&amp;#39;s what is really going</text>
  <text start="572.05" dur="5.58">on out in Ukraine but we&amp;#39;ll have to wait</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="7.2">and see because as we know the neocons</text>
  <text start="577.63" dur="6.3">and the rest they played dirty they push</text>
  <text start="581.8" dur="3.54">events they might have an event Ukraine</text>
  <text start="583.93" dur="3.33">to say see we need more of these weapons</text>
  <text start="585.34" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see what happens</text>
  <text start="587.26" dur="3.3">you can see that they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="588.82" dur="3.72">a war in North Korea they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="590.56" dur="4.89">push one in Ukraine and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="592.54" dur="4.32">going to give up we see Lavrov is saying</text>
  <text start="595.45" dur="3.57">that there is no need for the United</text>
  <text start="596.86" dur="5.61">States to get involved into a bloody war</text>
  <text start="599.02" dur="5.51">with North Korea he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="602.47" dur="5.67">United States is misinterpreting what</text>
  <text start="604.53" dur="6.97">Russia is saying and now he said that</text>
  <text start="608.14" dur="5.55">Russia says the following Russia does</text>
  <text start="611.5" dur="5.1">not share the desire of some states or</text>
  <text start="613.69" dur="5.34">to exert maximum pressure on North Korea</text>
  <text start="616.6" dur="4.59">which is often interpreted by them as</text>
  <text start="619.03" dur="5.34">establishing full economic and political</text>
  <text start="621.19" dur="6.48">blockade of his of this country by all</text>
  <text start="624.37" dur="5.4">available means Russia&amp;#39;s position here</text>
  <text start="627.67" dur="5.25">is completely opposite to what the</text>
  <text start="629.77" dur="6.06">neocons the war mongers the Cabal really</text>
  <text start="632.92" dur="4.95">want to do and they keep taking what</text>
  <text start="635.83" dur="5.79">Russia is saying and they&amp;#39;re twisting it</text>
  <text start="637.87" dur="6.23">and what they&amp;#39;re saying is that listen</text>
  <text start="641.62" dur="5.28">there needs to be a peaceful resolution</text>
  <text start="644.1" dur="4.84">North Korea is not going to attack</text>
  <text start="646.9" dur="3.6">anyone North Korea is not going to do</text>
  <text start="648.94" dur="3.45">anything now I see the Cabal the</text>
  <text start="650.5" dur="3.72">corporate media they&amp;#39;re playing up North</text>
  <text start="652.39" dur="3.57">Korea big-time where they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="654.22" dur="4.44">the defectors they had radiation</text>
  <text start="655.96" dur="4.95">detected on them one of them had some</text>
  <text start="658.66" dur="3.96">type of anthrax antibodies on them as</text>

  <text start="869.74" dur="7.03">what he&amp;#39;s saying here is that listen</text>
  <text start="873.2" dur="6.389">were continually calling you on this and</text>
  <text start="876.77" dur="5.1">if you don&amp;#39;t abide but what is happening</text>
  <text start="879.589" dur="5.131">here in Syria by what we&amp;#39;re saying we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="881.87" dur="4.62">going to the UN the world will vote and</text>
  <text start="884.72" dur="5.16">you know what the world&amp;#39;s going to vote</text>
  <text start="886.49" dur="5.73">the world is going to vote to remove</text>
  <text start="889.88" dur="4.74">yourself from a country that is</text>
  <text start="892.22" dur="5.489">sovereign that you weren&amp;#39;t invited into</text>
  <text start="894.62" dur="9.9">and there&amp;#39;s no reason for them to even</text>
  <text start="897.709" dur="9.091">be there now James Madison that the</text>
  <text start="904.52" dur="4.56">troops are going to stay in Syria until</text>
  <text start="906.8" dur="5.25">achieving progress in the political</text>
  <text start="909.08" dur="5.16">sediment now Lavrov pointed out that</text>
  <text start="912.05" dur="4.38">such state is surprising because it</text>
  <text start="914.24" dur="4.14">means that Washington where you reserves</text>
  <text start="916.43" dur="3.93">the right to determine the progress and</text>
  <text start="918.38" dur="4.47">wants to keep control over part of</text>
  <text start="920.36" dur="6.12">Syrian territory to achieve the result</text>
  <text start="922.85" dur="6.6">it wants and the United States they</text>
  <text start="926.48" dur="5.76">don&amp;#39;t have this right there they have no</text>
  <text start="929.45" dur="7.05">rights in this country whatsoever to</text>
  <text start="932.24" dur="9.12">demand anything and they affirmed that</text>
  <text start="936.5" dur="8.04">the UN sc2 254 which the United States</text>
  <text start="941.36" dur="5.849">supported the decision on the future of</text>
  <text start="944.54" dur="6.6">Syria can only be taken by the Syrian</text>
  <text start="947.209" dur="6.151">people and this is what Russia is</text>
  <text start="951.14" dur="4.92">pushing right now so we&amp;#39;ve had many many</text>
  <text start="953.36" dur="6.15">calls for the United States to leave</text>
  <text start="956.06" dur="5.82">Syria and I think the next step they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="959.51" dur="6.99">going to the UN and the United States</text>
  <text start="961.88" dur="6.84">will be forced to leave Syria and we can</text>
  <text start="966.5" dur="4.77">see that time is ticking down for the</text>
  <text start="968.72" dur="5.94">Cabal it&amp;#39;s ticking down in North Korea</text>
  <text start="971.27" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s taken down in Ukraine and once</text>
  <text start="974.66" dur="3.54">again unless they tried something with</text>
  <text start="976.64" dur="3.9">Iran or someplace else</text>
  <text start="978.2" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re rotating actually</text>
  <text start="980.54" dur="3.45">if you really look at it</text>
  <text start="981.5" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re trying everything and once again</text>
  <text start="983.99" dur="4.97">they&amp;#39;re being pushed against the wall</text>
  <text start="986.42" dur="4.61">their backs are against the wall</text>
  <text start="988.96" dur="4.35">they only have one thing left because</text>
  <text start="991.03" dur="3.93">you could see here in the states the</text>
  <text start="993.31" dur="3.36">corporate media they&amp;#39;re struggling to</text>
  <text start="994.96" dur="3.48">keep their stories straight on what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="996.67" dur="3.54">really going on and every time they try</text>
  <text start="998.44" dur="3.51">to report on something you know what the</text>
  <text start="1000.21" dur="4.2">ridiculous things like you know Trump is</text>
  <text start="1001.95" dur="4.98">watching TV all day long I mean all this</text>
  <text start="1004.41" dur="4.02">garbage is just fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="1006.93" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re just throwing anything they</text>
  <text start="1008.43" dur="4.68">possibly can out there and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1010.47" dur="5.4">even make sense half the time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1013.11" dur="4.62">keeping that public busy with garbage</text>
  <text start="1015.87" dur="3.75">because they don&amp;#39;t want people to</text>
  <text start="1017.73" dur="4.62">realize and understand what is really</text>
  <text start="1019.62" dur="6.66">happening around the world that their</text>
  <text start="1022.35" dur="5.82">power is being eliminated and it looks</text>
  <text start="1026.28" dur="3.03">like they might be preparing and I</text>
  <text start="1028.17" dur="3.03">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="1029.31" dur="3.899">type of an event during the Olympic</text>
  <text start="1031.2" dur="3.57">period of time or maybe in the next</text>
  <text start="1033.209" dur="3.301">couple of weeks because we could see</text>
  <text start="1034.77" dur="3.15">that time is really ticking down and</text>
  <text start="1036.51" dur="5.22">they don&amp;#39;t have that much time out there</text>
  <text start="1037.92" dur="6.96">because once the United States starts to</text>
  <text start="1041.73" dur="5.16">leave because the UN the people there</text>
  <text start="1044.88" dur="4.17">might be a resolution that is brought up</text>
  <text start="1046.89" dur="5.58">their vote on it and the United States</text>
  <text start="1049.05" dur="4.8">has to leave well it&amp;#39;s game over because</text>
  <text start="1052.47" dur="4.5">then they have North Korea Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="1053.85" dur="4.98">Iran and if they don&amp;#39;t have Syria Iran&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1056.97" dur="3.42">not going to do you know it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="1058.83" dur="3.9">to do them that much good because Russia</text>
  <text start="1060.39" dur="3.39">and China backs them so what are they</text>
  <text start="1062.73" dur="3.09">really going to do there you know what</text>
  <text start="1063.78" dur="4.46">Rana is not going to attack anyone so</text>
  <text start="1065.82" dur="5.13">this is gonna be a tough tough situation</text>
  <text start="1068.24" dur="6.46">so all they have left is Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="1070.95" dur="5.04">North Korea and this is the only thing</text>
  <text start="1074.7" dur="3.3">they can do unless they have some type</text>
  <text start="1075.99" dur="4.77">of an event in Syria before they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1078" dur="4.62">before they actually leave and we can</text>
  <text start="1080.76" dur="5.22">see right now it could happen anywhere</text>
  <text start="1082.62" dur="5.01">anytime within the next month or two</text>
  <text start="1085.98" dur="3.72">listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
