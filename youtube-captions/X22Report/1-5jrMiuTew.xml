  <text start="28.89" dur="3.299">and the title of this episode is I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="30.929" dur="3.031">believe there&amp;#39;s going to be an economic</text>
  <text start="32.189" dur="6.631">collapse and the reason why I say this</text>
  <text start="33.96" dur="7.379">is when you look around and you look at</text>
  <text start="38.82" dur="5.58">the stock market it&amp;#39;s making all-time</text>
  <text start="41.339" dur="5.881">highs the SPS making all-time highs and</text>
  <text start="44.4" dur="5.369">gold is being pushed down below 1,400</text>
  <text start="47.22" dur="4.649">silvers being pushed down and to</text>
  <text start="49.769" dur="4.051">everyone else looking at it everyone&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="53.82" dur="4.619">mean look the stock market continually</text>
  <text start="56.28" dur="4.14">goes up all the companies are doing well</text>
  <text start="58.439" dur="6.621">they&amp;#39;re all making profits there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="60.42" dur="10.559">nothing wrong but you know if you take a</text>
  <text start="65.06" dur="10.419">closer look you can see that nothing</text>
  <text start="70.979" dur="8.221">makes sense that companies really aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="6.901">making profits actually a lot of</text>
  <text start="79.2" dur="7.29">companies are laying off or being</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="7.08">prepared to lay off so you know we have</text>
  <text start="86.49" dur="4.769">to look at everything and not just the</text>
  <text start="89.46" dur="5.939">stock market because the stock market is</text>
  <text start="91.259" dur="6.81">not a gauge for the entire economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.399" dur="5.58">not the gauge of what the government is</text>
  <text start="98.069" dur="5.4">doing it&amp;#39;s not the gauge of all the laws</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="8.551">they&amp;#39;re passing it&amp;#39;s not the gauge of</text>
  <text start="103.469" dur="8.161">the wars they are in acting so yeah to</text>

  <text start="169.76" dur="4.44">sometimes I talk without thinking and</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="6.75">then I go back and go holy crap what did</text>
  <text start="174.2" dur="11.52">I say but I I know two people that just</text>
  <text start="178.67" dur="9.63">got let go from their jobs and they are</text>
  <text start="185.72" dur="5.73">starting to look for jobs and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="188.3" dur="6">having a tough time right now trying to</text>
  <text start="191.45" dur="5.66">find jobs and they&amp;#39;re you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="194.3" dur="5.67">wondering like what&amp;#39;s going on because</text>
  <text start="197.11" dur="6.43">everything that they hear and they read</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="6.06">and everything that the government is</text>
  <text start="203.54" dur="4.47">telling them is that it should be you</text>
  <text start="206.03" dur="4.35">know quite easy to find a job because</text>
  <text start="208.01" dur="6.99">the unemployment has come down quite a</text>
  <text start="210.38" dur="9.359">bit and they also noticed that the jobs</text>
  <text start="215" dur="6.57">that they do find that are out there the</text>
  <text start="219.739" dur="6.481">salaries are lower than what they were</text>
  <text start="221.57" dur="10.56">making so you know this is a good</text>
  <text start="226.22" dur="8.97">indication where reality and fiction you</text>
  <text start="232.13" dur="9.09">know start to meet and for those people</text>
  <text start="235.19" dur="9.389">who either lose their jobs or are still</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="8.43">looking for them they know what the</text>
  <text start="244.579" dur="8.241">reality is because I remember when there</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="6.6">was a good time where there were jobs</text>
  <text start="252.82" dur="6.88">all over the place I mean I mean back</text>
  <text start="256.25" dur="4.919">then I open up a newspaper and you you</text>
  <text start="259.7" dur="4.14">know I&amp;#39;m in the technology field it was</text>
  <text start="261.169" dur="6.181">it was you could take your pick I mean I</text>
  <text start="263.84" dur="7.319">was going on interviews you know four</text>
  <text start="267.35" dur="6.02">five six times a week and that is a good</text>
  <text start="271.159" dur="6.29">job market</text>
  <text start="273.37" dur="7.769">a you can look on the internet and find</text>
  <text start="277.449" dur="6.331">hardly any jobs out there and even when</text>
  <text start="281.139" dur="5.191">you do send your resume and things like</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="7.109">that most of these people never get back</text>
  <text start="286.33" dur="8.91">to you so you know you can see where</text>
  <text start="290.889" dur="7.59">things are not connected and the reality</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="6.12">of the job market and the fictional job</text>
  <text start="298.479" dur="5.041">market you know are starting to butt</text>
  <text start="301.36" dur="4.07">against each other because as more and</text>
  <text start="303.52" dur="3.99">more people become unemployed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.43" dur="4.209">getting harder and harder for them to</text>
  <text start="307.51" dur="5.25">find jobs and they it makes no sense to</text>
  <text start="309.639" dur="5.191">anyone but again you don&amp;#39;t know it until</text>
  <text start="312.76" dur="7.83">you&amp;#39;re in it and you see it for</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="9.089">yourselves now let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="6.389">economic collapse news the the stock</text>
  <text start="323.919" dur="8.881">market is definitely a disconnect from</text>
  <text start="326.979" dur="7.351">reality I mean it it it the stock market</text>
  <text start="332.8" dur="5.67">is just going higher and higher and</text>
  <text start="334.33" dur="10.769">higher and to me all that tells me is</text>
  <text start="338.47" dur="11.37">that we have a really far fall down when</text>
  <text start="345.099" dur="7.32">it pops when the bubble bursts it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="349.84" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re building it up so high that it</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="8.43">is going to be disastrous when this</text>
  <text start="355.33" dur="8.13">thing goes and in this article I think</text>
  <text start="360.849" dur="6.211">this was on Zero Hedge basically it says</text>
  <text start="363.46" dur="6.84">investors take note stocks are always</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="8.4">the last to get it this bubble will end</text>
  <text start="370.3" dur="7.38">as all bubbles do in a disaster so you</text>
  <text start="375.46" dur="6.45">know it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how high this</text>
  <text start="377.68" dur="6.33">goes because when it when it collapses</text>
  <text start="381.91" dur="7.92">people are going to be shocked and</text>
  <text start="384.01" dur="8.879">stunned of what just happened ok</text>
  <text start="389.83" dur="5.519">the eurozone is entering its longest</text>
  <text start="392.889" dur="5.491">ever slump the GDP in the quarter shrank</text>
  <text start="395.349" dur="6.331">by 0.2% which is worse than 0.1%</text>
  <text start="398.38" dur="6.81">shrinkage that had been expected so</text>
  <text start="401.68" dur="5.34">basically the bad news is that this is</text>
  <text start="405.19" dur="5.52">now the euro zone&amp;#39;s long</text>
  <text start="407.02" dur="6.99">ever slump and we know this the euro</text>
  <text start="410.71" dur="6.81">peon nations are not doing well because</text>
  <text start="414.01" dur="5.76">of the massive unemployment the</text>

  <text start="424.27" dur="11.07">over the place and it there is no way</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="9.69">that in anyone&amp;#39;s and anyone who can see</text>
  <text start="435.34" dur="7.05">this say that everything is ok because</text>
  <text start="438.49" dur="6.78">you wouldn&amp;#39;t have unemployment at 12:15</text>
  <text start="442.39" dur="5.28">youth unemployment at 62 percent it it</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="5.16">just doesn&amp;#39;t work that way because the</text>
  <text start="447.67" dur="6.12">less people employed the less they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.43" dur="5.55">spending in retail the less that that</text>
  <text start="453.79" dur="4.86">other companies have to manufacture it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="455.98" dur="4.89">a whole cycle that just completely just</text>
  <text start="458.65" dur="8.01">falls apart and we&amp;#39;re seeing this over</text>

  <text start="518.17" dur="6.32">years the graph only goes one way and</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="5.91">that is up let&amp;#39;s even go back further</text>
  <text start="524.49" dur="5.86">even in the Great Depression when they</text>
  <text start="527.17" dur="8">were confiscating gold they were giving</text>
  <text start="530.35" dur="9.12">people $20 an ounce for their gold as</text>
  <text start="535.17" dur="7.14">soon as the government had the gold they</text>
  <text start="539.47" dur="5.97">upped at the 35</text>
  <text start="542.31" dur="6.49">so those people who hid their gold and</text>
  <text start="545.44" dur="6.45">then give it in all of a sudden went</text>

  <text start="572.86" dur="6.69">on I I buy more I find that this is</text>
  <text start="577.87" dur="3.69">great because I know where it&amp;#39;s going I</text>
  <text start="579.55" dur="4.92">know the only place is going it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="581.56" dur="5.34">up that&amp;#39;s all I know they can do</text>

  <text start="586.9" dur="6.35">the paper market they can do what they</text>
  <text start="590.11" dur="5.91">have to do because they want the price</text>
  <text start="593.25" dur="4.09">let&amp;#39;s think of it this way the reason</text>
  <text start="596.02" dur="3.42">why the price is going down because</text>
  <text start="597.34" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it as cheap as</text>
  <text start="599.44" dur="5.43">possible for them to buy it why do they</text>
  <text start="602.56" dur="3.84">want to buy on the highs so let&amp;#39;s do</text>
  <text start="604.87" dur="3.3">what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re bringing down</text>

  <text start="1138.75" dur="7.99">most of the people don&amp;#39;t even see this</text>
  <text start="1141.49" dur="7.68">happening now there was a breaking story</text>
  <text start="1146.74" dur="5.34">that multiple explosive devices were</text>
  <text start="1149.17" dur="6.48">found in a home near Los Angeles now I</text>
  <text start="1152.08" dur="6.48">don&amp;#39;t know any more about this I just</text>
  <text start="1155.65" dur="6.36">saw this headline and if something comes</text>
  <text start="1158.56" dur="6.44">out of this you know we&amp;#39;ll have to watch</text>
  <text start="1162.01" dur="8.75">this I just wanted to bring that up and</text>
  <text start="1165" dur="8.29">this was an interesting story in our tea</text>
  <text start="1170.76" dur="5.2">authorities hunting for nuclear gauge</text>
  <text start="1173.29" dur="4.95">lost in West Virginia now a portable</text>
  <text start="1175.96" dur="4.38">gauge containing a dangerous radioactive</text>
  <text start="1178.24" dur="4.83">material fell off the back of a truck in</text>
  <text start="1180.34" dur="5.13">West Virginia and officials are offering</text>
  <text start="1183.07" dur="4.53">a reward for the missing device I just</text>
  <text start="1185.47" dur="6.18">want to say how does something like this</text>
  <text start="1187.6" dur="7.59">fall off the back of a truck I mean</text>
  <text start="1191.65" dur="6.99">really a radioactive device with</text>
  <text start="1195.19" dur="5.84">material I mean they don&amp;#39;t have this tie</text>
  <text start="1198.64" dur="6.15">down somehow</text>
  <text start="1201.03" dur="5.4">so I mean was it did it really fall off</text>
  <text start="1204.79" dur="2.79">the truck or is that all they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1206.43" dur="3.19">because</text>
  <text start="1207.58" dur="4.86">this sounds a little strange to me and</text>
  <text start="1209.62" dur="4.05">it just seems something just doesn&amp;#39;t sit</text>
  <text start="1212.44" dur="3.57">right with me so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="1213.67" dur="5.37">take we&amp;#39;re gonna have to just watch this</text>
  <text start="1216.01" dur="4.71">you know you know and they go on to say</text>
  <text start="1219.04" dur="3.57">it is critical for anyone who has</text>
  <text start="1220.72" dur="4.89">information about the lost nuclear gauge</text>
  <text start="1222.61" dur="5.16">to contact the Pennsylvania DEP Nuclear</text>
  <text start="1225.61" dur="5.1">Regulatory Commission or local law</text>
  <text start="1227.77" dur="4.68">enforcement agency immediately as long</text>
  <text start="1230.71" dur="4.32">as the device is not tampered with or</text>
  <text start="1232.45" dur="4.92">damaged it prevents no hazards of Public</text>
  <text start="1235.03" dur="5.1">Safety so basically what I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="1237.37" dur="8.34">like holy crap let&amp;#39;s say didn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="1240.13" dur="6.75">fall off the truck and it was stolen but</text>
  <text start="1245.71" dur="3.48">you know they don&amp;#39;t want to get people</text>
  <text start="1246.88" dur="5.82">in a panic so it&amp;#39;s better to say it fell</text>
  <text start="1249.19" dur="5.94">off you know it&amp;#39;s almost like yeah this</text>
  <text start="1252.7" dur="3.93">TV and stereo equipment just fell off</text>
  <text start="1255.13" dur="2">the back of the truck you know what I</text>
  <text start="1256.63" dur="4.32">mean</text>
  <text start="1257.13" dur="7.47">but let&amp;#39;s say somebody has this now and</text>
  <text start="1260.95" dur="8.66">they connect this to a bomb or something</text>
  <text start="1264.6" dur="8.08">now this is like some type of dirty</text>
  <text start="1269.61" dur="8.86">radioactive type of bomb that can be</text>
  <text start="1272.68" dur="8.01">used in some type of event I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1278.47" dur="4.56">saying it will happen I&amp;#39;m just reading</text>
  <text start="1280.69" dur="3.75">this article I&amp;#39;m reading what happened</text>

  <text start="1284.44" dur="6.72">what they&amp;#39;re reporting and my mind</text>
  <text start="1287.05" dur="5.66">starts to wander and wonder what is</text>
  <text start="1291.16" dur="5.81">really going on here</text>
  <text start="1292.71" dur="6.97">and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this</text>

  <text start="1299.68" dur="4.62">more articles coming out and I I see</text>
  <text start="1302.53" dur="2.88">more and more people talking about this</text>
  <text start="1304.3" dur="3.42">and you know how I am with the</text>
  <text start="1305.41" dur="3.66">cyberattacks and for those people who</text>
  <text start="1307.72" dur="3.96">are in know we&amp;#39;re just signing up I</text>
  <text start="1309.07" dur="4.47">believe the cyber attack is the perfect</text>
  <text start="1311.68" dur="3.99">storm I said it yesterday if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1313.54" dur="4.29">heard what I said just go back and and</text>
  <text start="1315.67" dur="5.73">listen to that broadcast but I see this</text>
  <text start="1317.83" dur="6.57">general is saying you know mark my words</text>
  <text start="1321.4" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s going to get worse this disruptive</text>
  <text start="1324.4" dur="5.07">destructive attacks on our country will</text>
  <text start="1326.65" dur="5.01">get worse if we don&amp;#39;t do something the</text>
  <text start="1329.47" dur="9.18">theft of intellectual property will get</text>
  <text start="1331.66" dur="11.03">worse and he goes on to say that we need</text>
  <text start="1338.65" dur="9">to do something but they always meant</text>
  <text start="1342.69" dur="6.82">you know basically cyberattacks could</text>
  <text start="1347.65" dur="5.61">well be seen in the not-too-distant</text>
  <text start="1349.51" dur="6.87">future on key US infrastructure sectors</text>
  <text start="1353.26" dur="6.18">such as public utilities power grid</text>
  <text start="1356.38" dur="6.75">water supply and financial services they</text>
  <text start="1359.44" dur="7.17">always if you noticed every time a</text>

  <text start="1366.61" dur="6.08">a cyberattack it&amp;#39;s always two things</text>
  <text start="1370.24" dur="8.159">that they include infrastructure and</text>

  <text start="1396.96" dur="4.329">they&amp;#39;re right the officials warned us</text>
  <text start="1399.49" dur="5.819">all along that this would happen and</text>
  <text start="1401.289" dur="6.931">they already said for many many months</text>

  <text start="1519.87" dur="8.55">main event okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now</text>
  <text start="1527.07" dur="4.8">there was an interesting article and I</text>
  <text start="1528.42" dur="4.65">put I put this on the x-22 site on this</text>
  <text start="1531.87" dur="3.69">page and also I&amp;#39;m going to put this</text>
  <text start="1533.07" dur="4.98">article on the article section of the</text>
  <text start="1535.56" dur="5.57">site how some states are not legally</text>
  <text start="1538.05" dur="5.82">ratify the sixteenth amendment and</text>
  <text start="1541.13" dur="10.48">basically the sixteenth Amendment is you</text>
  <text start="1543.87" dur="13.14">know the the the formation of the IRS</text>
  <text start="1551.61" dur="6.87">and the ability to tax the people so</text>
  <text start="1557.01" dur="4.2">basically this is what the sixteenth</text>
  <text start="1558.48" dur="6.63">Amendment says it allows the United</text>
  <text start="1561.21" dur="6.27">States Congress to levy an income tax</text>
  <text start="1565.11" dur="5.19">without apportioning it among the states</text>
  <text start="1567.48" dur="4.95">or basing it on census results the</text>
  <text start="1570.3" dur="3.84">amendment exempted income taxes from</text>
  <text start="1572.43" dur="4.23">Constitution requires regarding direct</text>
  <text start="1574.14" dur="5.49">taxes after income taxes on wrens</text>
  <text start="1576.66" dur="11.46">dividends and interest rule to be direct</text>
  <text start="1579.63" dur="10.38">taxes so basically basically it says the</text>
  <text start="1588.12" dur="4.35">Congress shall have power to lay and</text>
  <text start="1590.01" dur="5.19">collect taxes on incomes from whatever</text>

  <text start="1595.2" dur="7.7">the several states and without regard to</text>
  <text start="1597.39" dur="8.43">any census or enumeration so basically</text>
  <text start="1602.9" dur="5.11">this is the sixteenth amendment now what</text>
  <text start="1605.82" dur="3.13">this article is saying is that the</text>
  <text start="1608.01" dur="3.549">sixteen mm</text>
  <text start="1608.95" dur="5.189">was not ratified and he goes on to say</text>
  <text start="1611.559" dur="5.34">the sixteenth amendment had been sent</text>
  <text start="1614.139" dur="4.53">out in 1909 to the state governors for</text>
  <text start="1616.899" dur="4.321">ratification by the state legislators</text>
  <text start="1618.669" dur="6.651">after having been passed by Congress</text>
  <text start="1621.22" dur="8.4">there were 48 states at that time and</text>
  <text start="1625.32" dur="5.979">3/4 or 36 of them were required to give</text>
  <text start="1629.62" dur="4.529">their approval in order for it to be</text>
  <text start="1631.299" dur="4.74">ratified the process took almost the</text>
  <text start="1634.149" dur="7.471">whole term of the Taft administration</text>
  <text start="1636.039" dur="7.801">from 1909 to 1913 Knox had received</text>
  <text start="1641.62" dur="4.86">responses from 42 states when he</text>
  <text start="1643.84" dur="6.809">declared the 16th amendment ratified on</text>
  <text start="1646.48" dur="6.24">February 25th 1913 interesting 1913</text>
  <text start="1650.649" dur="4.53">isn&amp;#39;t that when the fed was started okay</text>
  <text start="1652.72" dur="3.72">just a few days before leaving office to</text>
  <text start="1655.179" dur="4.59">make way for the administration of</text>

  <text start="1663.97" dur="4.89">rejected it and he counted 38 states as</text>
  <text start="1666.76" dur="4.139">having approved it we will now examine</text>
  <text start="1668.86" dur="3.659">some of the key evidence bill Benson</text>
  <text start="1670.899" dur="3.74">found regarding the approval of the</text>
  <text start="1672.519" dur="5.731">amendment in many of those states in</text>
  <text start="1674.639" dur="5.951">Oklahoma the legislation changed the</text>
  <text start="1678.25" dur="4.95">wording of the amendment so that so that</text>
  <text start="1680.59" dur="4.74">its meaning was virtually the opposite</text>
  <text start="1683.2" dur="3.93">of what was intended by Congress and</text>
  <text start="1685.33" dur="4.68">this was the version they sent back to</text>
  <text start="1687.13" dur="5.22">Knox yet Knox counted Oklahoma as</text>
  <text start="1690.01" dur="5.039">approving it despite a memo from its</text>
  <text start="1692.35" dur="5.549">chief legal counsel Reuben Clark that</text>
  <text start="1695.049" dur="5.25">states were not allowed to change it in</text>
  <text start="1697.899" dur="3.931">any way attorneys who have studied the</text>
  <text start="1700.299" dur="3.75">subject have agreed that Kentucky in</text>
  <text start="1701.83" dur="6.27">Oklahoma should not have been counted as</text>
  <text start="1704.049" dur="7.171">approvals by by Philander Knox and</text>
  <text start="1708.1" dur="4.38">moreover if any state could be shown to</text>
  <text start="1711.22" dur="3.329">have violated its own state</text>
  <text start="1712.48" dur="4.65">constitutional laws in its approval</text>
  <text start="1714.549" dur="6.061">process when that state&amp;#39;s approval would</text>
  <text start="1717.13" dur="7.08">have to be thrown out that gets us past</text>
  <text start="1720.61" dur="5.88">the presumptive conclusion argument</text>
  <text start="1724.21" dur="4.23">which says that the actions of the</text>
  <text start="1726.49" dur="4.559">executive official cannot be judged by a</text>
  <text start="1728.44" dur="5.849">court and admits that Knox could be</text>
  <text start="1731.049" dur="4.891">wrong if we subtract Kentucky and</text>
  <text start="1734.289" dur="5.191">Oklahoma from the third eighth approval</text>
  <text start="1735.94" dur="6.03">the count now is at 36 the exact number</text>
  <text start="1739.48" dur="3.029">needed for ratification if any more</text>
  <text start="1741.97" dur="3.419">states can</text>
  <text start="1742.509" dur="5.34">have been invalid approvals the 16th</text>
  <text start="1745.389" dur="6.48">amendment must be regarded as null and</text>
  <text start="1747.849" dur="6.5">void Texas and Louisiana violated</text>
  <text start="1751.869" dur="6.06">provisions in their state constitutions</text>
  <text start="1754.349" dur="5.14">prohibiting that the legislators from</text>
  <text start="1757.929" dur="3.9">empowering the federal government with</text>
  <text start="1759.489" dur="7.081">any additional taxing authority now the</text>
  <text start="1761.829" dur="7.62">number is down to 33 how much more it</text>
  <text start="1766.57" dur="5.039">isn&amp;#39;t it is to authenticate a</text>
  <text start="1769.449" dur="4.29">constitutional amendment yet a number of</text>
  <text start="1771.609" dur="6.3">states that not do this returning</text>
  <text start="1773.739" dur="6.27">uncertified unsigned and/or unsealed</text>
  <text start="1777.909" dur="4.71">copies and did not rectify their</text>
  <text start="1780.009" dur="6.03">decadent negligence even after being</text>
  <text start="1782.619" dur="5.64">reminded and warned by Knox the most</text>
  <text start="1786.039" dur="5.31">egregious offenders were Ohio California</text>
  <text start="1788.259" dur="6.42">Arkansas Mississippi and Minnesota which</text>
  <text start="1791.349" dur="7.14">did not send any copy at all so Knox</text>
  <text start="1794.679" dur="6.36">could have not could not have known what</text>
  <text start="1798.489" dur="4.91">they even voted on since four of these</text>
  <text start="1801.039" dur="4.62">states were already disqualified above</text>
  <text start="1803.399" dur="4.69">California is now subtracted from the</text>
  <text start="1805.659" dur="6.81">list of valid approvals reducing it to</text>
  <text start="1808.089" dur="6.39">20 so basically it goes on to say and</text>
  <text start="1812.469" dur="4.29">you know I skipped some of the things so</text>
  <text start="1814.479" dur="6.6">that&amp;#39;s why the count might seem off but</text>
  <text start="1816.759" dur="6.78">it goes on to say you know that we</text>
  <text start="1821.079" dur="5.67">didn&amp;#39;t have the number of states to</text>
  <text start="1823.539" dur="8.01">actually ratify the sixteenth amendment</text>
  <text start="1826.749" dur="8.1">and it didn&amp;#39;t really matter they just</text>
  <text start="1831.549" dur="5.49">did whatever they wanted to do and the</text>
  <text start="1834.849" dur="9.56">sixteenth amendment was they just said</text>
  <text start="1837.039" dur="11.19">it was ratified so you know so basically</text>
  <text start="1844.409" dur="7.54">from what this is saying that all these</text>
  <text start="1848.229" dur="6.51">taxes and everything are null and void</text>
  <text start="1851.949" dur="7.2">and again they need these taxes because</text>
  <text start="1854.739" dur="7.02">of the fed because when you when you</text>
  <text start="1859.149" dur="5.64">borrow money and you need to repay it on</text>
  <text start="1861.759" dur="5.61">interest you need the taxes from the</text>
  <text start="1864.789" dur="5.46">people to pay the interest on the debt</text>
  <text start="1867.369" dur="4.74">and this is why they needed the</text>
  <text start="1870.249" dur="5.27">sixteenth amendment and they needed this</text>
  <text start="1872.109" dur="3.41">to go forward</text>
  <text start="1875.919" dur="10.781">so basically we&amp;#39;re living in an</text>
  <text start="1882.919" dur="9.18">environment and as we find out more and</text>
  <text start="1886.7" dur="8.669">more of laws and amendments and things</text>
  <text start="1892.099" dur="6.36">that they try to pass always seem to be</text>
  <text start="1895.369" dur="6.21">in the dead of night it always seems to</text>
  <text start="1898.459" dur="5.31">be in the 12th hour it always seems to</text>
  <text start="1901.579" dur="7.01">be buried and thousands of pages of</text>
  <text start="1903.769" dur="9.301">documentation it always seems not to be</text>
  <text start="1908.589" dur="6.4">legal just like we see what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1913.07" dur="6.689">with Obama gait and I&amp;#39;ll just call it</text>
  <text start="1914.989" dur="7.201">Obama gate because it&amp;#39;s Benghazi IRS the</text>

  <text start="1928.399" dur="7.97">is a different angle and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1930.979" dur="10.41">these things on purpose for their agenda</text>
  <text start="1936.369" dur="10.69">and we can see this over and over and</text>
  <text start="1941.389" dur="10.02">they always seem to create an event to</text>
  <text start="1947.059" dur="8.1">knock our view away from what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1951.409" dur="5.75">going on and they are experts at this</text>
  <text start="1955.159" dur="5.19">and if you have never seen wag the dog</text>
  <text start="1957.159" dur="7.39">see that movie because it is amazing the</text>
  <text start="1960.349" dur="7.44">way you know something comes up they</text>
  <text start="1964.549" dur="6.151">need a story they make us look someplace</text>
  <text start="1967.789" dur="6.09">else with the distraction a lot is going</text>
  <text start="1970.7" dur="5.699">on right now they&amp;#39;re going to need a lot</text>
  <text start="1973.879" dur="5.99">of events a lot of distractions and</text>
  <text start="1976.399" dur="5.94">another thing that&amp;#39;s interesting back in</text>
  <text start="1979.869" dur="5.44">2008 mmm going a little off track here</text>
  <text start="1982.339" dur="4.17">I noticed right before the crash and I</text>
  <text start="1985.309" dur="4.891">think I mentioned this before one of my</text>
  <text start="1986.509" dur="8.46">other episodes that gold go look on KITT</text>
  <text start="1990.2" dur="9.779">go and take the graph from 2007 to 2008</text>
  <text start="1994.969" dur="8.4">and look at the graph from 2013 right</text>
  <text start="1999.979" dur="7.32">now to that in the 2012 2013 right</text>
  <text start="2003.369" dur="5.641">before the crash of 2008 gold went down</text>
  <text start="2007.299" dur="4.081">and it was</text>
  <text start="2009.01" dur="4.28">and that as far as is being pushed down</text>
  <text start="2011.38" dur="5.82">now but it was pushed pretty far over</text>
  <text start="2013.29" dur="7.06">many days it dropped and I find the</text>
  <text start="2017.2" dur="6.42">pattern very interesting that it</text>
  <text start="2020.35" dur="4.86">happened a couple of months right before</text>
  <text start="2023.62" dur="5.34">the crash and the same things happening</text>
  <text start="2025.21" dur="7.92">now and this also corresponds with the D</text>
  <text start="2028.96" dur="5.82">H insider from Hagman and Hagman and if</text>
  <text start="2033.13" dur="4.8">you don&amp;#39;t know his tight is the homeland</text>
  <text start="2034.78" dur="6.12">security u.s. calm and if you look up</text>
  <text start="2037.93" dur="6.51">the H insider they said during the</text>
  <text start="2040.9" dur="6.15">spring look for the dips in gold and</text>

  <text start="2047.05" dur="5.7">closer to the economic collapse and I</text>
  <text start="2049.99" dur="6.45">just find it and they said this back and</text>
  <text start="2052.75" dur="6.27">I think with December of 2012 that right</text>
  <text start="2056.44" dur="7.4">now we&amp;#39;re in May because he also said in</text>
  <text start="2059.02" dur="7.889">the springtime we are seeing these dips</text>
  <text start="2063.84" dur="4.42">which is amazing to me that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2066.909" dur="4.591">happening right now</text>
  <text start="2068.26" dur="6.98">and we see many other things happening</text>
  <text start="2071.5" dur="6.33">even though it looks you know like</text>
  <text start="2075.24" dur="4.12">everything is fine and you really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2077.83" dur="4.079">believe because when you walk out your</text>

  <text start="2089.11" dur="7.98">is this true is this really happening</text>
  <text start="2091.33" dur="8.76">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s I guess our way of coping</text>
  <text start="2097.09" dur="4.59">and dealing with it and then you come</text>
  <text start="2100.09" dur="3.72">back to it and you say you know what</text>
  <text start="2101.68" dur="6.48">there&amp;#39;s too much evidence there&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="2103.81" dur="6.33">much real hard facts that point is that</text>
  <text start="2108.16" dur="4.59">- yes there is a collapse and how can</text>
  <text start="2110.14" dur="4.8">other people see this when you leave and</text>
  <text start="2112.75" dur="8.18">you stop listening to the alternative</text>

  <text start="2120.93" dur="6.19">know that you know like Greg hunter from</text>
