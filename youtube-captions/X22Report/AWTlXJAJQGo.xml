  <text start="85.41" dur="6.69">printed at 98 for April better than</text>
  <text start="88.979" dur="5.281">expected and it&amp;#39;s showing that right now</text>
  <text start="92.1" dur="7.17">the current conditions are at the</text>
  <text start="94.26" dur="7.2">highest level since november of 2000 now</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="4.44">once again we have to remember people</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="4.98">believe and they think that things are</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="4.71">going well because well the stock market</text>
  <text start="106.44" dur="4.679">is at all times yes it&amp;#39;s been bobbing up</text>
  <text start="108.42" dur="5.22">and down and people believe that jobs</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="4.981">are coming back manufacturing is coming</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="5.1">back and the economy is going to do very</text>
  <text start="116.1" dur="4.62">well but we can see that things well</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re really not doing well and most</text>
  <text start="120.72" dur="5.52">of the time these consumer surveys well</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="4.56">they really don&amp;#39;t show the whole entire</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="5.219">picture because when we start looking at</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="5.3">some of these economic indicators we see</text>
  <text start="131.459" dur="5.821">that things are rapidly changing and</text>
  <text start="133.85" dur="5.59">things are rapidly falling apart you be</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="4.47">a strategist Matthew mish has been</text>
  <text start="139.44" dur="5.37">looking at the spiking loan</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="6.66">delinquencies and he made some startling</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="5.85">discoveries showing that households</text>
  <text start="148.41" dur="4.62">making over a hundred thousand per year</text>
  <text start="150.66" dur="4.889">are two and a half times more likely to</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="4.89">default on loan payments over the next</text>
  <text start="155.549" dur="4.891">12 months than those making under 40,000</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="5.22">because making more money just means you</text>
  <text start="160.44" dur="5.01">can afford more debt now first the</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="4.44">survey evidence suggests the rise in</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="3.99">consumer perceptions has occurred</text>
  <text start="167.58" dur="4.439">primarily in the middle and upper</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="3.96">household incomes and those consumers</text>
  <text start="172.019" dur="4.44">concern with missing a payment are</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="6.51">highest in the upper income category of</text>
  <text start="176.459" dur="5.401">a hundred thousand dollars plus and the</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="3.87">most shocking results of the</text>
  <text start="181.86" dur="5.01">survey suggests that Millennials are</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="6.27">over five times more likely default than</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="5.28">folks aged 45 and above and another</text>
  <text start="190.05" dur="4.98">discovery shows that people with the</text>
  <text start="192.15" dur="5.1">most debt were also found to be most at</text>
  <text start="195.03" dur="4.65">risk of default well that just</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="5.28">completely makes sense now you be as</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="4.89">concluded that people are just far more</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="5.76">comfortable defaulting on debt in</text>
  <text start="204.57" dur="5.67">general in the post-crisis error and we</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="4.32">can see that auto delinquencies while</text>
  <text start="210.24" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re rising we see corporate defaults</text>
  <text start="212.61" dur="4.71">those are rising those individuals that</text>
  <text start="215.31" dur="5.46">were working in retail well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="6.84">losing their jobs we see the traffic for</text>
  <text start="220.77" dur="5.49">restaurants that is declining and we see</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="4.98">that the Fed the Fed is just raising</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="5.28">interest rates and what we see and what</text>
  <text start="229.14" dur="5.13">we understand right now is that us home</text>
  <text start="231.54" dur="5.58">buyers well they can&amp;#39;t afford a four</text>
  <text start="234.27" dur="5.75">percent mortgage and the Fed wants to</text>
  <text start="237.12" dur="5.85">raise interest rates further by 1.5%</text>
  <text start="240.02" dur="5.29">what do you think is going to happen the</text>
  <text start="242.97" dur="5.07">housing market is going to start to</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="5.1">collapse as this happens now we</text>
  <text start="248.04" dur="4.35">discussed how the fed they&amp;#39;re raising</text>
  <text start="250.41" dur="4.38">interest rates because they know that</text>
  <text start="252.39" dur="5.36">this is going to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="6.02">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is more</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="6.33">indication that the Fed is actually</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="6.4">communicating a collapse of the economy</text>
  <text start="264.08" dur="6.16">now the Fed is clearly and plainly</text>
  <text start="267.21" dur="6.54">telling us that it intends to take the</text>
  <text start="270.24" dur="6.9">US and completely collapse it not just</text>
  <text start="273.75" dur="6.419">the US but the global economy now the</text>
  <text start="277.14" dur="7.2">Fed is messaging two to three more rate</text>
  <text start="280.169" dur="8.041">hikes this year into a sluggish very</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="6.72">very very weak slow economy and the</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="5.43">federal funds rate has been raised by 80</text>
  <text start="291.06" dur="6.18">basis points and meanwhile the 10-year</text>
  <text start="293.64" dur="8.1">US Treasury yield has flatlined and at</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="6.78">this pace the spread which is as near a</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="4.739">foolproof indicator of recession or a</text>
  <text start="304.02" dur="5.22">collapse of the economy as we have</text>
  <text start="306.479" dur="7.261">suggest by year end we will have a</text>
  <text start="309.24" dur="5.329">collapse scenario the spread is simply</text>
  <text start="313.74" dur="3.799">the diff</text>
  <text start="314.569" dur="5.641">of what banks borrow short Len long and</text>
  <text start="317.539" dur="5.011">live on the spread between the two again</text>
  <text start="320.21" dur="5.939">borrow short on daily basis at neuro</text>
  <text start="322.55" dur="7.319">zero and then long at near the 10-year</text>
  <text start="326.149" dur="6.871">yield now the spread is minimal or</text>
  <text start="329.869" dur="7.38">negative recession is either underway or</text>
  <text start="333.02" dur="7.229">imminent pretty much clockwork from 1952</text>
  <text start="337.249" dur="6.39">1981 the Federal Reserve was intent on</text>
  <text start="340.249" dur="6.15">raising rates via the FFR the federal</text>
  <text start="343.639" dur="4.68">funds rate but to do so it had to raise</text>
  <text start="346.399" dur="4.651">the short-term federal funds rate</text>
  <text start="348.319" dur="5.07">significantly higher than the 10-year to</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="5.369">successfully raise longer rates the</text>
  <text start="353.389" dur="6.45">impact of a successful pushing longer</text>
  <text start="356.419" dur="7.71">term rates higher were rate in version</text>
  <text start="359.839" dur="6.78">and recessions now from 1981 to present</text>
  <text start="364.129" dur="4.56">the Federal Reserve has undertaken five</text>
  <text start="366.619" dur="4.89">rate cycles cutting rates but</text>
  <text start="368.689" dur="7.5">subsequently only partially hiking them</text>
  <text start="371.509" dur="7.22">back up each cycle cut-rate deeper held</text>
  <text start="376.189" dur="5.25">them at the cycle minimum longer and</text>
  <text start="378.729" dur="6.04">subsequently height them less than</text>
  <text start="381.439" dur="7.53">previous but what we need to understand</text>
  <text start="384.769" dur="6.031">is that each time the US economy went</text>
  <text start="388.969" dur="3.57">into recession before the Federal</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="5.25">Reserve could effectively push the</text>
  <text start="392.539" dur="7.11">ten-year 10-year yield higher via its</text>
  <text start="396.05" dur="6.269">short-term ffr or more simply put that</text>
  <text start="399.649" dur="5.7">feds tool to hike long-term rates killed</text>
  <text start="402.319" dur="5.88">the interest rate sensitive economy</text>
  <text start="405.349" dur="6.27">before a long-term rate increase could</text>
  <text start="408.199" dur="5.99">be achieved hmm haven&amp;#39;t we said this</text>
  <text start="411.619" dur="5.19">before haven&amp;#39;t we looked at this before</text>
  <text start="414.189" dur="6.97">where we looked at two thousand seven</text>
  <text start="416.809" dur="7.01">six 2007-2008 and we saw exactly what</text>
  <text start="421.159" dur="5.34">they did now if the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="423.819" dur="5.14">follows this path that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.499" dur="5.28">communicating right now if the ten-year</text>
  <text start="428.959" dur="5.1">performs as it has for the last four</text>
  <text start="431.779" dur="5.61">decades and the inverted spread</text>
  <text start="434.059" dur="5.88">indicates what it has for the last seven</text>
  <text start="437.389" dur="5.661">decades we will begin the collapse</text>
  <text start="439.939" dur="7.95">scenario starting late 2017 and</text>
  <text start="443.05" dur="6.489">completely collapsing in 2018 and</text>
  <text start="447.889" dur="6.09">this is the pattern they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="449.539" dur="7.261">all along broken down so we can see it</text>
  <text start="453.979" dur="5.701">as plain as day and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="456.8" dur="4.44">that the Fed they are preparing and</text>
  <text start="459.68" dur="3.959">they&amp;#39;re communicating to the world right</text>
  <text start="461.24" dur="5.669">now letting everyone know that they are</text>
  <text start="463.639" dur="5.071">bringing this economy down so what does</text>
  <text start="466.909" dur="3.991">everyone need to do at this point they</text>
  <text start="468.71" dur="4.109">need to be prepared and ready we need to</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="3">watch what is happening because we could</text>
  <text start="472.819" dur="3.06">see what&amp;#39;s happening in the stock market</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="4.169">we can see what&amp;#39;s happening around the</text>
  <text start="475.879" dur="5.19">world and we can see what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="478.069" dur="6.66">doing right now it is all coming</text>
  <text start="481.069" dur="6.96">together now turkey what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="484.729" dur="5.641">is they are planning to confiscate gold</text>
  <text start="488.029" dur="5.311">of course to help their citizens and</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="5.729">this is the way the government&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="493.34" dur="4.319">leaders the central banks this is what</text>
  <text start="496.099" dur="4.5">they like to push out there that</text>
  <text start="497.659" dur="6.301">everything that we&amp;#39;re doing is really to</text>
  <text start="500.599" dur="5.75">help you to keep you safe and we can see</text>
  <text start="503.96" dur="4.379">right now Turkey&amp;#39;s dwindling credit and</text>
  <text start="506.349" dur="5.73">significant decline in their currency</text>
  <text start="508.339" dur="6.39">well has led them to this clever idea of</text>
  <text start="512.079" dur="4.811">confiscating gold and making it seem</text>
  <text start="514.729" dur="4.17">like they&amp;#39;re not really confiscating the</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="4.74">gold and making it seem like it&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="518.899" dur="5.07">for you of course the people in Turkey</text>
  <text start="521.63" dur="4.29">the Turkish central bank has come up</text>
  <text start="523.969" dur="4.62">with an idea on how to confiscate</text>
  <text start="525.92" dur="5.22">private gold while pretending they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="528.589" dur="4.831">helping you earn money their objective</text>
  <text start="531.14" dur="3.99">is to take the private gold stocks of</text>
  <text start="533.42" dur="4.62">the citizens available to the financial</text>
  <text start="535.13" dur="4.399">system for themselves this turkey</text>
  <text start="538.04" dur="3.63">central bank is launching two new</text>
  <text start="539.529" dur="5.411">investment opportunities for physical</text>
  <text start="541.67" dur="6.57">gold what are they well they are issuing</text>
  <text start="544.94" dur="6.269">a gold bond on one hand and on the other</text>
  <text start="548.24" dur="5.55">an instrument for the loan of gold and</text>
  <text start="551.209" dur="4.171">gold jewelry the scheme is that the</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="3.75">Turkish government is really seeking to</text>
  <text start="555.38" dur="4.17">use the precious metal in the private</text>
  <text start="557.54" dur="5.1">sector making it available to the</text>
  <text start="559.55" dur="6.21">financial industry now this is being</text>
  <text start="562.64" dur="5.22">marked as broadening the financial</text>
  <text start="565.76" dur="3.99">system allowing citizens to earn</text>
  <text start="567.86" dur="3.57">additional income with their gold</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="5.16">reserves under their mattresses by</text>
  <text start="571.43" dur="6.06">turning it over to the government and of</text>
  <text start="574.91" dur="4.56">course we can see what is happening here</text>
  <text start="577.49" dur="3.82">now remember when we talk about gold</text>
  <text start="579.47" dur="3.52">confiscation when we</text>
  <text start="581.31" dur="3.48">about the government doing these type of</text>
  <text start="582.99" dur="4.65">things they&amp;#39;re not going to come to your</text>
  <text start="584.79" dur="6.09">home and just take everything that you</text>
  <text start="587.64" dur="6.6">have what they do is they make it seem</text>
  <text start="590.88" dur="6.99">like what we&amp;#39;re doing is to help you or</text>
  <text start="594.24" dur="7.89">you need to help the government and this</text>
  <text start="597.87" dur="7.44">is a way where they make you think that</text>

  <text start="605.31" dur="6.09">robbing you at the same time just like</text>
