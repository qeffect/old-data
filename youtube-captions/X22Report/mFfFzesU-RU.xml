  <text start="52.98" dur="5.34">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the</text>
  <text start="56.28" dur="5.91">x22 report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.32" dur="6.95">episode 1326 a and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="62.19" dur="5.429">7th 2017 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.27" dur="5.38">massive inflection point headed our way</text>
  <text start="67.619" dur="5.25">will this lead to a crash this fall</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="4.95">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="4.801">financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="75.6" dur="3.78">strange things happen in the market</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="4.11">especially with gold and silver where</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="4.68">all of a sudden someone sells you know</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="4.979">thousands upon thousands of contracts</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="5.52">brings down the gold price and the</text>
  <text start="86.759" dur="5.601">silver price and we know that this is</text>
  <text start="89.58" dur="6.929">complete manipulation we also seen on</text>
  <text start="92.36" dur="5.77">the stock market where Amazon all of a</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="3.86">sudden just dropped out of nowhere now</text>
  <text start="98.13" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re saying these are all glitches</text>
  <text start="100.369" dur="7.871">and just last night we had a silver</text>
  <text start="104.91" dur="6.78">flash crash now this is being reported</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="6.48">as a glitch and this implies there was</text>
  <text start="111.69" dur="5.13">no person or fat-finger banker spoofing</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="7.05">the market it just was a computer error</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="7.02">and all of a sudden 8200 contracts were</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="5.909">dumped into the market in five minutes</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="8.1">and silver drops 6% before all of a</text>
  <text start="127.679" dur="6.181">sudden snapping back so the question is</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="4.049">because we know that these markets are</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="3.81">manipulated we know that they use these</text>
  <text start="135.989" dur="3.631">systems we know that the Fed has a</text>
  <text start="137.67" dur="3.929">trading desk we know they have a</text>
  <text start="139.62" dur="3.6">computer system where they can make the</text>
  <text start="141.599" dur="3.151">market go up they can make the market go</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="4.769">down they can make the market do</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="5.79">whatever they want and the question is</text>
  <text start="147.989" dur="5.041">are these really glitches or were they</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="4.71">planning on doing something and then all</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="4.02">of a sudden change their mind because</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="4.89">these are becoming more and more</text>
  <text start="157.05" dur="5.519">frequent and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="160.14" dur="4.08">that a lot of this doesn&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="162.569" dur="4.89">sense actually the market doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="6.09">make sense because things are not adding</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="4.981">up because look what&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="170.31" dur="6.42">retail market look what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="172.44" dur="5.64">corporate tax revenue so for the market</text>
  <text start="176.73" dur="4.589">to continually move up and up and up</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="5.85">something does not make sense plus we</text>
  <text start="181.319" dur="4.98">know central banks and other countries</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="3.02">around the world they&amp;#39;ve been buying a</text>
  <text start="186.299" dur="2.991">lot</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="6.09">of tech stocks they&amp;#39;ve been basically</text>
  <text start="189.29" dur="7.41">keeping the market up there in the tech</text>
  <text start="193.04" dur="5.25">sector so we know that unemployment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.7" dur="3.21">manipulated we know the markets</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="3.48">manipulated we know GDPs</text>
  <text start="199.91" dur="4.22">manipulated everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="201.77" dur="4.53">looking at is completely manipulated and</text>
  <text start="204.13" dur="3.97">people say why do you know this is</text>
  <text start="206.3" dur="4.68">manipulated are you just saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="208.1" dur="6.12">manipulated because when you put all the</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="5.85">pieces together it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense in</text>
  <text start="214.22" dur="5.519">what they&amp;#39;re reporting let&amp;#39;s look at the</text>
  <text start="216.83" dur="4.29">new Beale BLS report that they put out</text>
  <text start="219.739" dur="4.801">they said they added two hundred and</text>
  <text start="221.12" dur="6.06">twenty two thousand jobs now the BLS</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="4.44">reported that 31,000 employees they</text>
  <text start="227.18" dur="4.5">couldn&amp;#39;t work due to poor weather</text>
  <text start="228.98" dur="5.96">conditions which is roughly in line with</text>
  <text start="231.68" dur="5.7">the 35,000 average for June and yet some</text>
  <text start="234.94" dur="5.41">221 thousand workers who usually work</text>
  <text start="237.38" dur="6.63">full-time could only work part-time due</text>
  <text start="240.35" dur="6.06">to the weather last month really in</text>
  <text start="244.01" dur="4.979">maybe the weather was that bad all right</text>
  <text start="246.41" dur="4.859">that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense at all and then</text>
  <text start="248.989" dur="6.601">we look at this and we say okay where</text>
  <text start="251.269" dur="6.601">are all these jobs coming from now we</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="4.25">know that retail they&amp;#39;re closing stores</text>
  <text start="257.87" dur="5.58">we know a lot of people being laid off</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="5.5">we know that the food industry well the</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="5.339">restaurant Performance Index is dropping</text>
  <text start="265.34" dur="6.48">traffic is drying up and this is where</text>
  <text start="268.789" dur="6.121">all the workers are basically moving</text>
  <text start="271.82" dur="5.52">into now we know that the corporate jobs</text>
  <text start="274.91" dur="4.74">they are still laying off so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="277.34" dur="5.22">continually telling us overtime that</text>
  <text start="279.65" dur="6.6">we&amp;#39;re adding retail jobs we&amp;#39;re adding</text>
  <text start="282.56" dur="7.169">the foodservice jobs we&amp;#39;re adding health</text>
  <text start="286.25" dur="5.4">jobs and when you look at this this is</text>
  <text start="289.729" dur="5.731">just all part-time stuff we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="291.65" dur="7.23">really added manufacturing or real good</text>
  <text start="295.46" dur="5.15">full-time jobs where they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="298.88" dur="4.8">all these jobs are being added or</text>
  <text start="300.61" dur="5.95">basically in the part-time world so the</text>
  <text start="303.68" dur="5.43">question is how did the June payroll</text>
  <text start="306.56" dur="4.979">surprise so strongly to the upside</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="5.52">because we know that ADP well it looks</text>
  <text start="311.539" dur="4.531">like they were dropping in the amount of</text>
  <text start="314.63" dur="4.56">jobs that were being added in the</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="4.33">private sector well it was because of</text>
  <text start="319.19" dur="5.17">local government</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="5.97">they hired 35,000 jobs in June and</text>
  <text start="324.36" dur="4.559">they&amp;#39;re saying that the food service</text>
  <text start="326.37" dur="5.85">industry and drink places well they</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="6.78">added 29,000 jobs and we have the health</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="6.12">sector we had education and when we look</text>
  <text start="335.699" dur="5.581">at this we can see that these are all</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="5.37">part-time type of work some of the</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="5.009">government jobs they were full-time but</text>
  <text start="343.71" dur="8.67">then they also said that the retail</text>
  <text start="346.289" dur="8.671">sector added 8,000 people really with</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="4.7">all these stores shutting down with</text>
  <text start="354.96" dur="5.519">these stores declaring bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="357.08" dur="8.29">they&amp;#39;re adding employees to the retail</text>
  <text start="360.479" dur="5.94">sector even if they added 8,000 how many</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="5.6">were lost</text>
  <text start="366.419" dur="8.28">what 8,000 added to Amazon let&amp;#39;s say and</text>
  <text start="370.97" dur="6.46">what 75,000 lost in the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="374.699" dur="6.69">business that&amp;#39;s not a plus to the</text>
  <text start="377.43" dur="8.16">economy that&amp;#39;s a loss of jobs and we can</text>
  <text start="381.389" dur="8.161">see that these numbers are moving in the</text>
  <text start="385.59" dur="6.35">opposite direction of reality because</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re not even making sense anymore</text>
  <text start="391.94" dur="7.469">because when you see three thousand five</text>
  <text start="395.76" dur="7.08">thousand eight thousand stores closed</text>
  <text start="399.409" dur="3.94">you know that these jobs are completely</text>
  <text start="402.84" dur="4.17">lost</text>
  <text start="403.349" dur="5.461">where are they going to get jobs we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="407.01" dur="4.2">at another retail manufacturer or</text>
  <text start="408.81" dur="4.829">another retail store I should say no</text>
  <text start="411.21" dur="4.949">because too many of them are closing</text>
  <text start="413.639" dur="3.78">right now so we could see that these</text>
  <text start="416.159" dur="3.841">numbers really don&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="417.419" dur="4.68">whatsoever and as we move forward into</text>
  <text start="420" dur="4.76">this year well we&amp;#39;re going to have the</text>
  <text start="422.099" dur="6.481">manipulated numbers the BLS the GDP</text>
  <text start="424.76" dur="5.71">retail sales housing sales and all these</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="4.23">other things they&amp;#39;re going to be heading</text>
  <text start="430.47" dur="5.4">in one direction into manipulation world</text>
  <text start="432.81" dur="4.74">and the reality is going to be going in</text>
  <text start="435.87" dur="3.63">the opposite direction and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="3.27">to be separating which we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="4.11">for a very long time</text>
  <text start="440.82" dur="4.98">which tells us that these manipulated</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="5.489">numbers they&amp;#39;re really not making any</text>
  <text start="445.8" dur="5.88">sense at all now let&amp;#39;s think about this</text>
  <text start="449.099" dur="4.29">for a second we have retail businesses</text>
  <text start="451.68" dur="2.58">that are closing down people are losing</text>
  <text start="453.389" dur="2.761">their jobs</text>
  <text start="454.26" dur="5.97">there&amp;#39;s more and more real estate that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.15" dur="7.59">going to be basically empty out in strip</text>
  <text start="460.23" dur="4.41">malls in malls and a lot of these strip</text>
  <text start="463.74" dur="3.39">malls and moles</text>
  <text start="464.64" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re going to be going bankrupt a lot</text>
  <text start="467.13" dur="4.08">of these retail stores are going</text>
  <text start="468.99" dur="4.47">bankrupt a lot of small businesses are</text>
  <text start="471.21" dur="4.53">going bankrupt this is not because of</text>
  <text start="473.46" dur="6.21">online it&amp;#39;s because people aren&amp;#39;t making</text>
  <text start="475.74" dur="6.45">the same funds like they used to because</text>
  <text start="479.67" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re getting laid off and they only</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="3.75">can maybe find part-time jobs or they</text>
  <text start="484.2" dur="5.85">can&amp;#39;t find jobs at all so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="6.51">making the same salary as they were now</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re seeing commercial chapter 11</text>
  <text start="492.45" dur="5.94">bankruptcy z&amp;#39; well they&amp;#39;re on the rise</text>
  <text start="495.36" dur="7.5">they&amp;#39;ve jumped 16 percent year-over-year</text>
  <text start="498.39" dur="6.63">in June to 581 filings across the u.s.</text>
  <text start="502.86" dur="4.62">and these are all types large</text>
  <text start="505.02" dur="5.1">corporations tiny sole proprietorships</text>
  <text start="507.48" dur="5.43">and we can see that coming from the</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="4.859">american bankruptcy institute we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.91" dur="5.85">seeing that there are more and more</text>
  <text start="514.979" dur="8.19">filings that are occurring right now now</text>
  <text start="518.76" dur="7.95">the next wave of these bankruptcies well</text>
  <text start="523.169" dur="5.701">it is building right now and large and</text>
  <text start="526.71" dur="4.08">small retail operations while they&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="528.87" dur="4.56">the forefront and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="530.79" dur="6.39">something very important that when we</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="7.5">see all of these stores closed these are</text>
  <text start="537.18" dur="6.36">the big chain stores we also have to</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="5.7">remember there are many mom-and-pop type</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="6.54">of stores fashion shops and things like</text>
  <text start="546.63" dur="7.5">that that are closing so we have those</text>
  <text start="550.08" dur="5.7">piled on top of the chain stores which</text>
  <text start="554.13" dur="3.92">we can see we&amp;#39;re having a complete</text>
  <text start="555.78" dur="5.01">brick-and-mortar meltdown right now and</text>
  <text start="558.05" dur="4.54">again as we move forward we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="560.79" dur="6.06">see a lot more of this we also see</text>
  <text start="562.59" dur="7.38">consumer bankruptcies they are rising</text>
  <text start="566.85" dur="6.51">right now now the primary cause for the</text>
  <text start="569.97" dur="6.33">increase in filings are the 1.1 2</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="5.31">trillion in auto loans the trillion</text>
  <text start="576.3" dur="6.3">dollars in credit card debt and other</text>
  <text start="578.67" dur="6.99">consumer loans people well they spent</text>
  <text start="582.6" dur="5.28">the money and now the bill is coming due</text>
  <text start="585.66" dur="4.56">and they don&amp;#39;t have the funds to</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="4.5">make these payments either they lost</text>
  <text start="590.22" dur="5.82">their job or they lost their job and</text>
  <text start="592.38" dur="5.49">they got a part-time job and making ends</text>
  <text start="596.04" dur="3.84">meet becomes very very difficult so</text>
  <text start="597.87" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of consumer</text>
  <text start="599.88" dur="5.94">bankruptcies now on the rise the same</text>
  <text start="602.85" dur="5.19">with commercial bankruptcies I mean</text>
  <text start="605.82" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re heading into an area where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="608.04" dur="5.64">going to be completely one gigantic</text>
  <text start="610.71" dur="6.69">disaster now an analyst and Bank of</text>
  <text start="613.68" dur="6.9">America this analyst has written that</text>
  <text start="617.4" dur="7.65">over the next six months higher interest</text>
  <text start="620.58" dur="8.88">rates will likely be much more negative</text>
  <text start="625.05" dur="8.7">for stocks and credit yes credit given</text>
  <text start="629.46" dur="6.39">new Central Bank policies now we can see</text>
  <text start="633.75" dur="5.52">that we&amp;#39;re at the end of this credit</text>
  <text start="635.85" dur="5.31">cycle and we can see that the central</text>
  <text start="639.27" dur="3.12">bank is raising the interest rates we</text>
  <text start="641.16" dur="4.47">can see that they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="642.39" dur="6.12">unwind their balance sheet and what this</text>
  <text start="645.63" dur="6.69">analyst is saying is that by the Fed</text>
  <text start="648.51" dur="6.66">tightening and by the ECB saying that</text>
  <text start="652.32" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re going to be tightening well the</text>
  <text start="655.17" dur="5.25">bond yield they&amp;#39;re going to be rising</text>
  <text start="657.48" dur="5.67">and the volatility is going to be</text>
  <text start="660.42" dur="4.95">reducing the tech stocks now the Bank of</text>
  <text start="663.15" dur="5.31">America analyst says when looking at</text>
  <text start="665.37" dur="7.14">near-term catalysts he views the summer</text>
  <text start="668.46" dur="6.48">this summer of 2017 as a massive</text>
  <text start="672.51" dur="5.97">inflection point in central bank</text>
  <text start="674.94" dur="5.43">liquidity trade as this all happens this</text>
  <text start="678.48" dur="5.52">analyst is saying that we will likely</text>
  <text start="680.37" dur="6.77">lead to a big fall in the market most</text>
  <text start="684" dur="5.31">likely during the autumn time period and</text>
  <text start="687.14" dur="4.36">what they&amp;#39;re saying is they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="689.31" dur="5.13">at going all the way back in the past of</text>
  <text start="691.5" dur="6.6">when the Fed was tightening and when</text>
  <text start="694.44" dur="7.23">things started to turn downward and they</text>
  <text start="698.1" dur="6.84">pinpointed when the Fed reaches the</text>
  <text start="701.67" dur="6.27">interest rates around 2% or so very</text>
  <text start="704.94" dur="5.16">close to 2% this is when the market is</text>
  <text start="707.94" dur="5.43">going to start to fall apart and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="710.1" dur="8.76">expecting the Fed to raise the rates</text>
  <text start="713.37" dur="7.98">once again and maybe twice before the</text>
  <text start="718.86" dur="5.19">fall which will bring us</text>
  <text start="721.35" dur="6.21">to that point in time of where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="724.05" dur="5.01">very close to that 2% and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="727.56" dur="4.68">seeing right now if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="729.06" dur="6.6">we can see that this has happened pretty</text>
  <text start="732.24" dur="6.42">much almost every single time going all</text>
  <text start="735.66" dur="4.77">the way back to the to the Great</text>
  <text start="738.66" dur="5.19">Depression of 1929</text>
  <text start="740.43" dur="7.86">every time the Fed Titan where they were</text>
  <text start="743.85" dur="7.89">raising rates the market crashed now the</text>
  <text start="748.29" dur="5.31">last time we saw this was back in O 7</text>
  <text start="751.74" dur="5.16">where they were raising the interest</text>
  <text start="753.6" dur="5.73">rates in 2005-2006 they got it up to a</text>
  <text start="756.9" dur="5.09">certain point which was around 5% and</text>
  <text start="759.33" dur="5.52">then all of a sudden things started to</text>
  <text start="761.99" dur="6.82">completely fall apart and the entire</text>
  <text start="764.85" dur="6.84">system fell apart well we are very close</text>
  <text start="768.81" dur="5.97">to that period of where we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="771.69" dur="6.57">see the market fall apart and if it does</text>
  <text start="774.78" dur="7.35">hit this point we will start to see</text>
  <text start="778.26" dur="8.28">everything come apart and the entire</text>
  <text start="782.13" dur="7.14">system will start to fall now I believe</text>
  <text start="786.54" dur="6.18">that they&amp;#39;re going to do this in two</text>
  <text start="789.27" dur="7.29">parts yes the market might fall during</text>
  <text start="792.72" dur="5.82">the autumn time period but the Fed which</text>
  <text start="796.56" dur="4.68">they want to do they want to step in and</text>
  <text start="798.54" dur="5.22">they want to push stimulus and they want</text>
  <text start="801.24" dur="3.99">to lower the rates at this point because</text>
  <text start="803.76" dur="3.15">they know they can&amp;#39;t raise the rates and</text>
  <text start="805.23" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re going to lower the rates maybe</text>
  <text start="806.91" dur="3.99">even go in the negative territory and</text>
  <text start="808.56" dur="4.91">they&amp;#39;re going to ramp up stimulus and</text>
  <text start="810.9" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re going to say that they have</text>
  <text start="813.47" dur="5.59">saved the economy and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="816.69" dur="3.6">continue to pump in as much stimulus and</text>
  <text start="819.06" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re going to drop the rates</text>
  <text start="820.29" dur="4.44">dramatically during this period of time</text>
  <text start="822.6" dur="3.66">and of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="824.73" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re all going to say look what the</text>
  <text start="826.26" dur="6.99">Fed did they save the economy and once</text>
  <text start="830.04" dur="6.15">the economy is pumped up a little bit</text>
  <text start="833.25" dur="4.62">where they say okay it&amp;#39;s recovering now</text>
  <text start="836.19" dur="3.51">even though it really isn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="837.87" dur="4.08">the stock market everything else is</text>
  <text start="839.7" dur="4.14">going to be falling apart like crazy all</text>
  <text start="841.95" dur="4.71">of a sudden we&amp;#39;re going to get hit with</text>
  <text start="843.84" dur="5.73">some type of an event which they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="846.66" dur="4.56">blame this on maybe Trump maybe they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="849.57" dur="4.41">blame this on a cyber attack because a</text>
  <text start="851.22" dur="3.96">cyber attack will be very easy for them</text>
  <text start="853.98" dur="4.05">to use to say listen</text>
  <text start="855.18" dur="4.41">yes it was a cyberattack on the</text>
  <text start="858.03" dur="3.36">financial institutions we had to close</text>
  <text start="859.59" dur="3.75">the bank and they really have to show no</text>
  <text start="861.39" dur="3.78">proof because we can see in the past</text>
  <text start="863.34" dur="4.98">with everything that had been done with</text>
  <text start="865.17" dur="5.19">the Russian hacking the BNC attacks with</text>
  <text start="868.32" dur="3.84">the Sony attack from North Korea which</text>
  <text start="870.36" dur="3.27">really never happened they really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="872.16" dur="2.64">have to show any proof they just have to</text>
  <text start="873.63" dur="3.48">come out in the corporate media and tell</text>
  <text start="874.8" dur="3.78">you that this is happening and most</text>
  <text start="877.11" dur="3.27">likely this is what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="878.58" dur="4.35">during this time period so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="880.38" dur="4.38">probably going to see something if this</text>
  <text start="882.93" dur="3.23">analyst is correct and we know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="884.76" dur="5.88">lot of other people like David Stockman</text>
  <text start="886.16" dur="6.04">Charles nanner Harry dent and many</text>
  <text start="890.64" dur="4.05">others that are saying that yes during</text>
  <text start="892.2" dur="4.98">this time period it looks like we might</text>
  <text start="894.69" dur="4.71">have a major problem now if they boost</text>
  <text start="897.18" dur="5.79">it up we might see the market come down</text>
  <text start="899.4" dur="6.6">once again probably in the spring time</text>
  <text start="902.97" dur="4.5">period of 2018 and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="906" dur="3.27">going to blame this on something else so</text>
  <text start="907.47" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;ll pump it up for the next couple</text>
  <text start="909.27" dur="3.48">of months and then all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="910.95" dur="3.36">whole thing will come apart and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="912.75" dur="4.8">have to close the banking system they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="914.31" dur="6.29">have to use baylin&amp;#39;s and the fun starts</text>
  <text start="917.55" dur="6.08">this is when the real collapse happens</text>
  <text start="920.6" dur="5.14">so we&amp;#39;re watching this very carefully</text>
  <text start="923.63" dur="3.34">we&amp;#39;re listening to what all these</text>
  <text start="925.74" dur="3.33">individuals are saying we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="926.97" dur="4.89">all the indicators putting them together</text>
  <text start="929.07" dur="4.38">and again this is not something that you</text>
  <text start="931.86" dur="3.81">can just pinpoint and say yes it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="933.45" dur="4.11">to happen at this point in time but with</text>
  <text start="935.67" dur="3.69">all the indicators and you add them all</text>
  <text start="937.56" dur="3.45">up and you go back in history and you</text>
  <text start="939.36" dur="4.62">put everything together you can get a</text>
  <text start="941.01" dur="6.39">general idea of when this is going to</text>
  <text start="943.98" dur="7.26">happen and we have never seen except two</text>
  <text start="947.4" dur="6.87">the lead-up of 2008 an economy fall</text>
  <text start="951.24" dur="4.68">apart like this before I mean yes if you</text>
  <text start="954.27" dur="3.06">go back to the other recession points in</text>
  <text start="955.92" dur="3.45">time even if you go back to the Great</text>
  <text start="957.33" dur="3.98">Depression you can see leading up to</text>
  <text start="959.37" dur="4.89">that point things were breaking down</text>
  <text start="961.31" dur="5.08">dramatically in the real economy I&amp;#39;m not</text>
