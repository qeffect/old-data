  <text start="31.22" dur="5.08">hi and welcome you listening to the x 22</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="3.75">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="36.3" dur="5.009">episode 829 and today&amp;#39;s date is november</text>
  <text start="38.73" dur="4.77">29th 2015 and the thought of this</text>
  <text start="41.309" dur="5.131">episode is the current economic collapse</text>
  <text start="43.5" dur="5.04">news brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="46.44" dur="3.63">economic collapse news now over the</text>
  <text start="48.54" dur="4.17">weekend we&amp;#39;ve had another mass shooting</text>
  <text start="50.07" dur="5.239">at the Planned Parenthood it was a</text>
  <text start="52.71" dur="5.19">standoff and as soon as this was over</text>
  <text start="55.309" dur="4.871">Obama came out and said enough is enough</text>
  <text start="57.9" dur="5.429">now we have to understand there is</text>
  <text start="60.18" dur="6.42">legislation which is just sitting there</text>
  <text start="63.329" dur="6.301">in Congress gaining no traction</text>
  <text start="66.6" dur="8.28">whatsoever and Obama has made it his</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="6.75">mission to basically push the</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="3.81">legislation that&amp;#39;s sitting there which</text>
  <text start="76.38" dur="4.98">is the Dianne Feinstein bill many other</text>
  <text start="78.69" dur="7.62">bills and the UN arms treaty through he</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="7.11">wants them through to try to get the</text>
  <text start="86.31" dur="4.94">weapons away from the people this is his</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="6.33">mission so we are going to see many</text>
  <text start="91.25" dur="6.25">events occur up until the time where</text>
  <text start="94.8" dur="6.39">he&amp;#39;s removed from office which is next</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="6.69">year so we can expect all throughout</text>
  <text start="101.19" dur="5.459">next year more and more these of these</text>
  <text start="104.19" dur="5.61">types of events because their mission is</text>
  <text start="106.649" dur="4.651">to take away the weapons from the people</text>
  <text start="109.8" dur="5.94">before this entire system comes</text>
  <text start="111.3" dur="8.939">crumbling them now as we know since the</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="8.78">false flag events in Paris we know</text>
  <text start="120.239" dur="7.291">France has been pushing many different</text>
  <text start="124.52" dur="5.65">types of legislation to basically take</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="6.02">the rights away from the people and we</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="8.819">see at this point that they are using</text>
  <text start="133.55" dur="7.84">these draconian laws to really make it</text>
  <text start="138.989" dur="4.561">difficult for the people to protest</text>
  <text start="141.39" dur="3.959">about certain things and things the</text>
  <text start="143.55" dur="3.63">government does not like they will</text>
  <text start="145.349" dur="5.64">enforce the laws what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="147.18" dur="8.52">now France basically is using their</text>
  <text start="150.989" dur="7.351">state emergency act to limit the number</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="6.15">of activists that want to protest the</text>
  <text start="158.34" dur="5.49">global warming summit at least 24</text>
  <text start="161.85" dur="2.75">environmental activists have been placed</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="4.07">under a house</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="6.03">best to avoid violent provocations while</text>
  <text start="167.9" dur="6.2">Paris is hosting a high-profile United</text>
  <text start="170.63" dur="6.45">Nations meeting on global warming and we</text>
  <text start="174.1" dur="4.87">can see at this point this is how is</text>
  <text start="177.08" dur="5.1">this is basically how government</text>
  <text start="178.97" dur="5.07">controls the people because of what</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="3.87">happened with the terrorists now they</text>
  <text start="184.04" dur="4.02">have the ability to say okay you can</text>
  <text start="186.05" dur="4.71">protest you&amp;#39;re fine with that oh you</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="6.36">cannot protest because we want this to</text>
  <text start="190.76" dur="5.52">pass we want people to listen to what</text>
  <text start="194.42" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;re saying we don&amp;#39;t want the crowds</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="5.37">out there basically taking their</text>
  <text start="200.21" dur="3.93">attention away from what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="201.65" dur="5.4">on here and we can see this at this</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="7.98">point is going to get worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="207.05" dur="7.68">time goes on now the u.s. is going to be</text>
  <text start="212.12" dur="6.18">declaring new broader support for</text>
  <text start="214.73" dur="5.76">Ukraine as we know the Mint&amp;#39;s to cease</text>
  <text start="218.3" dur="3.72">fire agreement expires the end of this</text>
  <text start="220.49" dur="3.45">year we understand the United States and</text>
  <text start="222.02" dur="4.62">many other nations are in their training</text>
  <text start="223.94" dur="5.52">their armed guards I mean the the army</text>
  <text start="226.64" dur="6.06">the National Guard Special Forces</text>
  <text start="229.46" dur="5.46">bringing in defensive lethal weapons</text>
  <text start="232.7" dur="5.7">into Ukraine we understand there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="234.92" dur="6.9">power outage in Crimea shelling has</text>
  <text start="238.4" dur="5.55">begun back in Donetsk and Lugansk all</text>
  <text start="241.82" dur="4.53">coming from the Kyiv region and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.95" dur="5.46">seeing that this is accelerating at this</text>
  <text start="246.35" dur="5.73">point and right now Geoffrey Pyatt the</text>
  <text start="249.41" dur="4.53">US ambassador to Ukraine says the US</text>
  <text start="252.08" dur="5.04">government intends to continue assist in</text>
  <text start="253.94" dur="6.74">Ukraine on its path of transformation</text>
  <text start="257.12" dur="7.95">and Obama on the eve of thanksgiving</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="6.88">signed the new defense bill which gives</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="5.22">three hundred billion dollars basically</text>
  <text start="267.56" dur="4.43">to ukraine so we can see how this is all</text>
  <text start="270.29" dur="5.28">starting to come together at this point</text>
  <text start="271.99" dur="7.63">now as soon as turkey shot down the</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="8">su-24 turkey decided that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="279.62" dur="8.94">going to violate greece airspace anymore</text>
  <text start="283.57" dur="7.39">so ever since they shot it down turkish</text>
  <text start="288.56" dur="5.1">warplanes abruptly ceased violating</text>
  <text start="290.96" dur="6.99">greek airspace after downing the Russian</text>
  <text start="293.66" dur="6.45">plane because Greece came out</text>
  <text start="297.95" dur="5.15">call them on it and said listen you shot</text>
  <text start="300.11" dur="5.97">down a plane that was in the country for</text>
  <text start="303.1" dur="5.68">17 or 10 seconds like you said of course</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="5.52">as we know today the plane never really</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="5.43">violated the airspace but if we go along</text>
  <text start="311.6" dur="5.07">with the Turkish story and you shot it</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="5.13">down and we understand from Greece they</text>
  <text start="316.67" dur="6.15">violated just in the last year thousands</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="4.71">upon thousands of times and guess what</text>
  <text start="322.82" dur="4.29">Greece did not shoot them down</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="5.46">whatsoever now we see a lot of protests</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="4.38">going on right now in the UK we see</text>
  <text start="329.51" dur="4.53">thousands of people they are mass</text>
  <text start="331.49" dur="4.22">protests have taken to London streets</text>
  <text start="334.04" dur="4.14">and other cities across the country</text>
  <text start="335.71" dur="5.83">urging the government not to conduct</text>
  <text start="338.18" dur="5.43">airstrikes in Syria get out of Syria</text>
  <text start="341.54" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t bomb Syria we don&amp;#39;t want our</text>
  <text start="343.61" dur="5.16">troops there we don&amp;#39;t want our planes</text>
  <text start="345.2" dur="5.82">their period that is it there is no</text>
  <text start="348.77" dur="4.47">reason why the u.s. the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="5.82">in all these countries need to be in</text>
  <text start="353.24" dur="6.54">Syria the only reason they&amp;#39;re there is</text>
  <text start="356.84" dur="5.37">to remove Assad to build the pipeline to</text>
  <text start="359.78" dur="4.62">put in the central bank to capture the</text>
  <text start="362.21" dur="4.74">natural gas the oil put it on the dollar</text>
  <text start="364.4" dur="6.9">that eventually go into Iran to prop the</text>
  <text start="366.95" dur="5.76">system up Damascus has already said when</text>
  <text start="371.3" dur="4.59">all the terrorists are out of the</text>
  <text start="372.71" dur="7.29">country and Syria is free of terrorism</text>
  <text start="375.89" dur="7.04">and Assad is reelected president once</text>
  <text start="380" dur="7.7">again they want Russia to come in and</text>
  <text start="382.93" dur="7.63">basically develop the oil with Syria and</text>
  <text start="387.7" dur="4.63">right now they have data that oil and</text>
  <text start="390.56" dur="4.7">gas deposits on the shelf off the coast</text>
  <text start="392.33" dur="5.22">of Syria have enormous potential and</text>
  <text start="395.26" dur="4.9">they want Russia to come in they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="397.55" dur="4.71">want the United States they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="400.16" dur="4.77">England they don&amp;#39;t want France they want</text>
  <text start="402.26" dur="3.87">Russia to come in and help them extract</text>
  <text start="404.93" dur="3.42">this and guess what the United States</text>
  <text start="406.13" dur="6.54">government central bankers are not going</text>
  <text start="408.35" dur="6.45">to let this happen now we see a lot of</text>
  <text start="412.67" dur="5.91">excuses coming out of the US government</text>
  <text start="414.8" dur="6.03">central bankers why Obama his</text>
  <text start="418.58" dur="5.58">administration decided not to bomb the</text>
  <text start="420.83" dur="5.97">convoys and we see a former CIA deputy</text>
  <text start="424.16" dur="4.56">director Michael Morell saying that</text>
  <text start="426.8" dur="3.24">Obama didn&amp;#39;t order the bombing of the</text>
  <text start="428.72" dur="2.86">Islamic state oil transportation</text>
  <text start="430.04" dur="2.83">infrastructure be</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="5.88">cause he was concerned about</text>
  <text start="432.87" dur="7.229">environmental damage yes he was</text>
  <text start="437.46" dur="7.28">concerned about that he didn&amp;#39;t go after</text>
  <text start="440.099" dur="6.66">oil wells he didn&amp;#39;t go after the convoys</text>
  <text start="444.74" dur="3.88">because you know you don&amp;#39;t want all that</text>
  <text start="446.759" dur="3.87">spilled oil but they went after the</text>
  <text start="448.62" dur="4.71">refineries which is very interesting</text>
  <text start="450.629" dur="5.01">they went after the electrical grid in</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="5.459">Aleppo which is very interesting they</text>
  <text start="455.639" dur="5.191">went after grain silos in Syria which is</text>
  <text start="458.789" dur="3.93">very interesting know the reason why</text>
  <text start="460.83" dur="3.959">they didn&amp;#39;t go after all of that is</text>
  <text start="462.719" dur="5.16">because it would stop the funding to</text>
  <text start="464.789" dur="5.461">their proxy army that&amp;#39;s why they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.879" dur="4.59">go in there this is why Russia went in</text>
  <text start="470.25" dur="4.199">there and started to destroy the convoys</text>
  <text start="472.469" dur="4.29">of the oil tankers the United States de</text>
  <text start="474.449" dur="3.511">said ok we&amp;#39;re going to destroy the</text>
  <text start="476.759" dur="3.861">convoys but we&amp;#39;re going to send down</text>
  <text start="477.96" dur="5.549">leaflets warn the drivers to get out and</text>
  <text start="480.62" dur="4.299">they staged an event where they bombed a</text>
  <text start="483.509" dur="3.21">couple of them and then they said they</text>
  <text start="484.919" dur="4.441">ran out of ammunition we cannot finish</text>
  <text start="486.719" dur="4.711">the job so we could see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="4.859">right now they&amp;#39;re putting on a show for</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="4.829">the American people and the world and in</text>
  <text start="494.219" dur="4.891">reality what&amp;#39;s happening is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.259" dur="5.821">really not bombing the convoys right now</text>
  <text start="499.11" dur="5.7">Putin is approved he has approved the</text>
  <text start="502.08" dur="4.5">economic sanctions against Turkey he</text>
  <text start="504.81" dur="4.829">signed a decree imposing a package of</text>
  <text start="506.58" dur="4.999">economic sanctions the measures include</text>
  <text start="509.639" dur="4.921">banning several Turkish organizations</text>
  <text start="511.579" dur="5.26">importing of certain goods and employers</text>
  <text start="514.56" dur="4.8">in Russia will be prohibited from hiring</text>
  <text start="516.839" dur="6">Turkish nationals to work starting the</text>
  <text start="519.36" dur="6.96">first of January of 2016 we see Russia</text>
  <text start="522.839" dur="6">right now basically is bringing in the</text>
  <text start="526.32" dur="5.31">t-90 tanks they arrived in Syria and</text>
  <text start="528.839" dur="6.331">they pushed him up to Aleppo to join the</text>
  <text start="531.63" dur="5.28">army and and to help out there the t-90</text>
  <text start="535.17" dur="4.68">tanks offer the Syrian army several</text>
  <text start="536.91" dur="6.06">features and they&amp;#39;re a little different</text>
  <text start="539.85" dur="7.94">than the t-55 and the t-72 they had the</text>
  <text start="542.97" dur="8.16">to a force 46 m125 smoothbore tank gun a</text>
  <text start="547.79" dur="5.53">four-stroke v12 piston engine and they</text>
  <text start="551.13" dur="4.41">also have the explosive reactive armor</text>
  <text start="553.32" dur="6.24">on them and we can see they&amp;#39;re making a</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="7.44">push pushing the moderates the Islamic</text>
  <text start="559.56" dur="5.17">state completely out of the country we</text>
  <text start="562.98" dur="5.049">see turkey right now</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="6.81">is boosting the arm supply into Syria</text>
  <text start="568.029" dur="7.231">weapons ammunition equipment all being</text>
  <text start="571.54" dur="7.229">moved into Syria and they&amp;#39;re exchanging</text>
  <text start="575.26" dur="5.009">it for oil antiquities that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="578.769" dur="2.731">state which is the proxy on by the</text>
  <text start="580.269" dur="3.961">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="581.5" dur="5.61">has looted from Syria and all of this is</text>
  <text start="584.23" dur="7.32">being done right now to build up the</text>
  <text start="587.11" dur="6.99">forces and help them out now Russia is</text>
  <text start="591.55" dur="5.07">saying they are ready to coordinate</text>
  <text start="594.1" dur="4.62">steps to block the border between Turkey</text>
  <text start="596.62" dur="4.26">and Syria they want President Hollande</text>
  <text start="598.72" dur="7.2">to help with this and implement a</text>
  <text start="600.88" dur="9.509">framework to cut the flow of weapons and</text>
  <text start="605.92" dur="7.46">the oil from Syria into Turkey and we</text>
  <text start="610.389" dur="8.581">know oregon&amp;#39;s Sun is behind all of this</text>
  <text start="613.38" dur="8.41">and we can see right now France is not</text>
  <text start="618.97" dur="4.859">going to work out a framework to cut off</text>
  <text start="621.79" dur="4.32">the border because they know that this</text>
  <text start="623.829" dur="4.831">helps the proxy army their main goal is</text>
  <text start="626.11" dur="6.659">always to get Assad France has already</text>
  <text start="628.66" dur="9">said yes we need Assad gone Assad cannot</text>
  <text start="632.769" dur="7.5">stay and all of this is a huge pretext</text>
  <text start="637.66" dur="6.419">to basically set up a safe zone and</text>
  <text start="640.269" dur="8.341">invade Syria this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="644.079" dur="6.331">setting up at this point so us is out</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="3.57">there saying that they demand turkey to</text>
  <text start="650.41" dur="3.659">seal up the hundred kilometer border</text>
  <text start="652.18" dur="3.93">region with Syria and it sounds</text>
  <text start="654.069" dur="4.051">fantastic they&amp;#39;re going to seal it up</text>
  <text start="656.11" dur="4.409">they&amp;#39;re going to make sure the Islamic</text>
  <text start="658.12" dur="4.44">state has no access there&amp;#39;s no way to</text>
  <text start="660.519" dur="4.921">bring the oil in there&amp;#39;s no ammunition</text>
  <text start="662.56" dur="6.529">going back and forth and of course this</text>
  <text start="665.44" dur="7.05">is a complete illusion coincidentally</text>
  <text start="669.089" dur="7.201">30,000 troops that they want to set up</text>
  <text start="672.49" dur="7.649">on the border to protect it is exactly</text>
  <text start="676.29" dur="8.229">what they estimated which would be</text>
  <text start="680.139" dur="8.551">needed to carve out a nato occupied safe</text>
  <text start="684.519" dur="8.401">zone coincidence i think not so right</text>
  <text start="688.69" dur="6.36">now the u.s. along with the coalition</text>
  <text start="692.92" dur="3.779">forces they&amp;#39;re trying to make it look</text>
  <text start="695.05" dur="3.54">like yes we&amp;#39;re going to seal this up</text>
  <text start="696.699" dur="4.711">that the border</text>
  <text start="698.59" dur="6.51">we&amp;#39;ll be safe and sound and we need the</text>
  <text start="701.41" dur="5.04">troops 30,000 of them to protect it but</text>
  <text start="705.1" dur="3.03">what it looks like they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="706.45" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re going to be using these 30,000</text>
  <text start="708.13" dur="6.39">troops to set up a safe zone in that</text>
  <text start="711.52" dur="5.49">area and might even be used to invade</text>
  <text start="714.52" dur="4.59">when needed we already know that turkey</text>
  <text start="717.01" dur="5.91">has moved more tanks up to the border</text>
  <text start="719.11" dur="6.78">and all of this with the immigration</text>
  <text start="722.92" dur="7.19">crisis where turkey just released all</text>
  <text start="725.89" dur="7.74">these refugees out into Europe it was</text>
  <text start="730.11" dur="6.88">used to create chaos it was used to</text>
  <text start="733.63" dur="5.64">bring in Europe into the fight and we</text>
  <text start="736.99" dur="6.75">can start to see what this was all done</text>
  <text start="739.27" dur="10.64">for basically this is for the European</text>
  <text start="743.74" dur="10.17">army a new model army so turkey dumped</text>
  <text start="749.91" dur="6.49">all these refugees on to Europe Europe</text>
  <text start="753.91" dur="4.73">is setting up border controls NATO is a</text>
  <text start="756.4" dur="5.82">fossil and they want to set up a</text>
  <text start="758.64" dur="5.71">European army now if a major NATO player</text>
  <text start="762.22" dur="3.9">like turkey is done from NATO then this</text>
  <text start="764.35" dur="4.44">means that the western central planners</text>
  <text start="766.12" dur="6.12">no longer have a multilateral beach head</text>
  <text start="768.79" dur="5.04">position at the historic crossroads of</text>
  <text start="772.24" dur="4.86">Europe Middle East and Asia this</text>
  <text start="773.83" dur="6.75">presents a some key problems for the</text>
  <text start="777.1" dur="5.79">west and NATO who&amp;#39;s going to lead in</text>
  <text start="780.58" dur="5.73">administrating Syria&amp;#39;s newly proposed</text>
  <text start="782.89" dur="6.87">safe zone it&amp;#39;s an ideal opportunity for</text>
  <text start="786.31" dur="5.91">a new power to move into the void which</text>
  <text start="789.76" dur="6.06">is the European Union back in March of</text>
  <text start="792.22" dur="8.37">2015 on 21st century wire they reported</text>
  <text start="795.82" dur="7.26">that basically a European Commission</text>
  <text start="800.59" dur="4.41">President jean-claude Juncker announced</text>
  <text start="803.08" dur="5.64">that the European Union now needs a</text>
  <text start="805" dur="7.17">standing army or an EU army to defend</text>
  <text start="808.72" dur="6.36">its values you know to defend themselves</text>
  <text start="812.17" dur="4.8">against sudden existential threats and</text>
  <text start="815.08" dur="4.5">he wasn&amp;#39;t referring to the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="816.97" dur="5.22">he was referring to Russia and two</text>
  <text start="819.58" dur="5.22">months later Juncker said the same exact</text>
  <text start="822.19" dur="4.5">thing such an army would also help us to</text>
  <text start="824.8" dur="3.6">form common foreign and security</text>
  <text start="826.69" dur="5.4">policies and allow Europe to take a</text>
  <text start="828.4" dur="4.47">responsibility in Europe and we can see</text>
  <text start="832.09" dur="4.37">right now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="832.87" dur="6.3">doing is they need to bring together</text>
  <text start="836.46" dur="4.78">European nations and with Turkey</text>
  <text start="839.17" dur="2.88">releasing the refugees under the</text>
  <text start="841.24" dur="3.15">direction of the United States</text>
  <text start="842.05" dur="5.6">government central bankers we see</text>
  <text start="844.39" dur="7.41">Germany France Britain and others</text>
  <text start="847.65" dur="7.24">planning the new EU army and it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="851.8" dur="4.77">final stages of planning right now the</text>
  <text start="854.89" dur="4.41">German Chancellor will ask Britain to</text>
  <text start="856.57" dur="5.04">stand aside as she promotes an ambitious</text>
  <text start="859.3" dur="6.63">blueprint to integrate continental</text>
  <text start="861.61" dur="5.79">Europe&amp;#39;s armed forces so what do we see</text>
  <text start="865.93" dur="3.12">happening on why do they need this well</text>
  <text start="867.4" dur="3.629">we understand that the entire system is</text>
  <text start="869.05" dur="4.08">coming crumbling down and we have the</text>
  <text start="871.029" dur="4.351">eurozone crisis the Greek economic</text>
  <text start="873.13" dur="5.73">meltdown Spain Portugal Cyprus Ireland&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="875.38" dur="5.16">all their economies are a complete</text>
  <text start="878.86" dur="6.919">disaster and it is spreading throughout</text>
  <text start="880.54" dur="9.09">Europe they have the migrant crisis</text>
  <text start="885.779" dur="6.281">which provides a perfect pretext to call</text>
  <text start="889.63" dur="6.12">for a new centralized federal EU border</text>
  <text start="892.06" dur="8.55">control agency this fits perfectly into</text>
  <text start="895.75" dur="6.959">the EU army so this was all planned it</text>
  <text start="900.61" dur="6.75">was to create this system to create</text>
  <text start="902.709" dur="9.451">chaos and to bring Europe into the fight</text>
  <text start="907.36" dur="8.099">here by creating this EU army the Paris</text>
  <text start="912.16" dur="6.33">attack was very important in order to</text>
  <text start="915.459" dur="5.011">join together with the Syrian conflict</text>
  <text start="918.49" dur="3.66">so they needed everyone together they</text>
  <text start="920.47" dur="3.23">needed an event because what was</text>
  <text start="922.15" dur="5.52">happening was Russia was completely</text>
  <text start="923.7" dur="5.86">destroying their proxy army in Syria and</text>
  <text start="927.67" dur="3.63">they needed a way to bring everyone</text>
  <text start="929.56" dur="5.58">together and this is what is happening</text>
  <text start="931.3" dur="6.69">right now and they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="935.14" dur="6">form this and this is going to be the</text>
  <text start="937.99" dur="4.98">battleground of World War three we can</text>
  <text start="941.14" dur="4.069">see everything is being set up all</text>
  <text start="942.97" dur="6.33">pieces are being moved into place and</text>
  <text start="945.209" dur="7.601">right now from all of this happening we</text>
  <text start="949.3" dur="6.03">see that countries are enacting these</text>
  <text start="952.81" dur="6.18">emergency policies decrees military</text>
  <text start="955.33" dur="5.64">actions and for the security state we</text>
  <text start="958.99" dur="3.81">could see that all of a sudden they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="960.97" dur="4.35">going to be creating this new EU FBI</text>
  <text start="962.8" dur="3.84">agency to help combat terror they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="965.32" dur="3.6">also considering</text>
  <text start="966.64" dur="5.37">creating this new EU CIA to help with</text>
  <text start="968.92" dur="6.09">the situation and we can see at this</text>

  <text start="975.01" dur="7.8">readied to go into Syria full force to</text>
  <text start="980.95" dur="4.56">remove Assad then eventually go into</text>

  <text start="999.61" dur="6.54">time before we see another event occur</text>
  <text start="1003" dur="5.01">they need to get this war off the ground</text>
  <text start="1006.15" dur="4.5">and they&amp;#39;re pushing as hard as they</text>
