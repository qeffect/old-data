  <text start="198.81" dur="5.31">the overall trend tends to be down and</text>
  <text start="202.08" dur="4.65">when you step back and you take a</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="5.46">longer-term view of things you can see</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="4.53">the devastation is breaking through and</text>
  <text start="209.58" dur="4.02">you can see what&amp;#39;s going on here the Dow</text>

  <text start="240.06" dur="6.33">have already seen almost a third of</text>
  <text start="243.15" dur="4.309">their value wiped out and this is just</text>
  <text start="246.39" dur="3.09">the beginning</text>
  <text start="247.459" dur="5.861">does it mean it&amp;#39;s gonna happen tomorrow</text>
  <text start="249.48" dur="5.52">no but what we&amp;#39;re taking away from all</text>
  <text start="253.32" dur="3.659">this is that the economy is</text>
  <text start="255" dur="3.15">deteriorating very very quickly and if</text>
  <text start="256.979" dur="2.581">we look at the housing market which</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="2.55">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="3.66">just look at the housing market here in</text>

  <text start="264.39" dur="6.18">globe we can see how things are just</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="5.88">completely imploding on itself when we</text>
  <text start="270.57" dur="5.4">look at Australia for instance we can</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="5.97">see that home prices they stopped rising</text>
  <text start="275.97" dur="5.48">in many places and when you look at this</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="6.48">you can see out in Sydney and Melbourne</text>
  <text start="281.45" dur="7.81">housing prices they are falling by over</text>
  <text start="285.51" dur="6.12">a thousand a week the boom time is over</text>

  <text start="291.63" dur="6.78">the implosion of housing prices it has</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="3.84">found what many have been predicting</text>
  <text start="298.41" dur="4.259">prices are dipping as interest rates are</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="6.21">rising with our biggest cities feeling</text>
  <text start="302.669" dur="6.271">the winds of change most keenly now</text>
  <text start="306.57" dur="5.49">finally gravity has caught up with that</text>
  <text start="308.94" dur="5.849">stupidity and prices are falling and in</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="5.039">Australia we&amp;#39;ve just tipped into</text>
  <text start="314.789" dur="5.471">negative territory with Canada right on</text>
  <text start="317.099" dur="7.891">the cusp in each country</text>
  <text start="320.26" dur="8.04">a reverse wealth effect is kicking in</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="7.33">homeowners they are seeing their equity</text>
  <text start="328.3" dur="6.96">in their houses it&amp;#39;s drying up their net</text>
  <text start="332.32" dur="4.68">worth is drying up and people are</text>
  <text start="335.26" dur="3.66">getting nervous and afraid they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="337" dur="4.56">starting to panic because they remember</text>
  <text start="338.92" dur="5.1">what happened back in 2008 and a lot of</text>
  <text start="341.56" dur="4.98">people believe this is their wealth and</text>
  <text start="344.02" dur="4.26">for many it is because a lot of people</text>

  <text start="348.28" dur="3.18">of people are depending on the house</text>
  <text start="349.99" dur="3.48">price continually moving up you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="351.46" dur="4.35">getting appreciation and eventually when</text>
  <text start="353.47" dur="4.41">you hit that certain age you want to</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="4.23">sell your house and reap the profits</text>

  <text start="364.33" dur="4.95">central banks have set up over time is</text>
  <text start="366.93" dur="5.41">falling apart right in front of our eyes</text>
  <text start="369.28" dur="4.98">and it&amp;#39;s accelerating right now and all</text>
  <text start="372.34" dur="4.02">the plans that the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="374.26" dur="3.96">put into place with the deep state that</text>
  <text start="376.36" dur="2.9">is also falling apart think about what</text>

  <text start="386.11" dur="4.32">years and years and years and when you</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="4.02">start removing them what happens things</text>
  <text start="390.43" dur="5.33">start to fall apart</text>
  <text start="391.63" dur="6.81">how in Sweden this is at the Rick&amp;#39;s Bank</text>
  <text start="395.76" dur="4.51">they were trying to go cashless they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.44" dur="4.29">saying we don&amp;#39;t need cash it&amp;#39;s not a big</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="4.29">deal and this was in preparation for the</text>
  <text start="402.73" dur="3.15">baylin&amp;#39;s because what they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="404.56" dur="2.52">to happen was they didn&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="405.88" dur="3.42">running to the banks taking out their</text>
  <text start="407.08" dur="3.9">savings in cash and then you know hiding</text>
  <text start="409.3" dur="3.57">it someplace else because they wanted to</text>
  <text start="410.98" dur="5.7">use bail-ins to go in and take those</text>
  <text start="412.87" dur="5.72">funds to keep the banks alive but right</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="4.83">now they realize that their plans</text>

  <text start="640.11" dur="4.6">portion of the Great Recession up to</text>
  <text start="643.09" dur="4.05">this point and everything that they were</text>
  <text start="644.71" dur="4.89">trying to do so we don&amp;#39;t forget what</text>
  <text start="647.14" dur="4.89">they were up to and even going back in</text>
  <text start="649.6" dur="6.48">time to show what they were planning all</text>
  <text start="652.03" dur="6.21">along this way we can always counter the</text>
  <text start="656.08" dur="3.81">argument from the mainstream media from</text>
  <text start="658.24" dur="3.18">the central bank where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="659.89" dur="3.87">well the economy&amp;#39;s falling apart right</text>
  <text start="661.42" dur="4.17">now because of Trump well we know better</text>

  <text start="672.73" dur="4.23">market is going to implode on itself now</text>
  <text start="675.43" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re talking about how the economy is</text>
  <text start="676.96" dur="4.47">not as great as Trump is saying it is</text>
  <text start="679.45" dur="3.66">but we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the economy</text>
  <text start="681.43" dur="4.23">for a very long time and we already knew</text>
  <text start="683.11" dur="3.09">that all of this was happening I mean</text>
  <text start="685.66" dur="4.5">think about it</text>
  <text start="686.2" dur="5.76">if you go back to 2008 and prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="690.16" dur="4.35">we were reporting on save the surprise</text>
  <text start="691.96" dur="4.14">securities and we were looking at</text>
  <text start="694.51" dur="3.21">subprime securities talking about how</text>
  <text start="696.1" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re manipulated there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="697.72" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re triple-a everyone in these</text>
  <text start="699.76" dur="4.29">subprime securities all wrapped up these</text>
  <text start="702.04" dur="3.51">are people that really couldn&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="704.05" dur="4.53">the homes they&amp;#39;re defaulting</text>
  <text start="705.55" dur="4.44">a lot of speculators in there and when</text>
  <text start="708.58" dur="3.78">we are looking at this we can say that</text>
  <text start="709.99" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s no way that the system can go on</text>
  <text start="712.36" dur="4.41">much further and if we looked at</text>
  <text start="714.67" dur="3.75">corporations back then we could say you</text>
  <text start="716.77" dur="3.51">know look at these corporations AIG</text>
  <text start="718.42" dur="3.18">Lehman and the rest they&amp;#39;re falling</text>
  <text start="720.28" dur="3.059">about look at the banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="721.6" dur="3.33">falling apart now of course people would</text>
  <text start="723.339" dur="3.211">have called us crazy they would have</text>
  <text start="724.93" dur="4.44">said what are you crazy look the economy</text>
  <text start="726.55" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s fantastic actually if you really</text>
  <text start="729.37" dur="3.06">look at those individuals that were</text>
  <text start="730.54" dur="3.81">looking into subprime security they did</text>
  <text start="732.43" dur="4.519">call them crazy actually Peter Schiff</text>
  <text start="734.35" dur="5.789">was out there and they called him crazy</text>
  <text start="736.949" dur="7.63">who&amp;#39;s really the crazy people the people</text>
  <text start="740.139" dur="6.541">who are believing the propaganda so back</text>
  <text start="744.579" dur="3.301">then if we were reporting on all this</text>
  <text start="746.68" dur="4.05">and there was a lot of people that were</text>
  <text start="747.88" dur="5.579">and looking into it in the beginning</text>
  <text start="750.73" dur="4.979">you&amp;#39;d be crazy but when it all fell</text>
  <text start="753.459" dur="5.211">apart you&amp;#39;d be like wow they were right</text>
  <text start="755.709" dur="5.391">here we are looking at all of this</text>
  <text start="758.67" dur="4.539">showing that it was falling apart</text>
  <text start="761.1" dur="4.479">countering what the mainstream media was</text>
  <text start="763.209" dur="3.721">doing back then if we were be countering</text>
  <text start="765.579" dur="3.51">the mainstream media because they had a</text>
  <text start="766.93" dur="6.269">completely different story and today</text>
  <text start="769.089" dur="6.661">we&amp;#39;re showing the same exact thing the</text>
  <text start="773.199" dur="4.981">mainstream media the central bank they</text>
  <text start="775.75" dur="4.829">just put the news out there to shape</text>
  <text start="778.18" dur="3.599">their narrative it&amp;#39;s not about telling</text>
  <text start="780.579" dur="2.94">the people the truth it&amp;#39;s not about</text>
  <text start="781.779" dur="4.321">telling the people this is what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="783.519" dur="4.68">happening then mainstream media protects</text>
  <text start="786.1" dur="3.81">the central bank there in collusion if</text>
  <text start="788.199" dur="3.24">you want to talk about collusion talk</text>
  <text start="789.91" dur="3.39">about the deep state the central bank</text>
  <text start="791.439" dur="4.65">and the mainstream media they are</text>
  <text start="793.3" dur="5.82">colluding and if you look at the economy</text>
  <text start="796.089" dur="4.531">today we already knew because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="799.12" dur="3.99">tracking it that the economy never</text>
  <text start="800.62" dur="4.459">really recovered it&amp;#39;s not because Trump</text>
  <text start="803.11" dur="4.289">all of a sudden implemented tariffs</text>
  <text start="805.079" dur="4.781">that&amp;#39;s not why the economy&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="807.399" dur="5.61">do well the economy never ever really</text>
  <text start="809.86" dur="6.12">recovered they created an illusion</text>
  <text start="813.009" dur="5.371">to make you think it did yes it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="815.98" dur="5.039">easy to do it&amp;#39;s very easy to go out and</text>
  <text start="818.38" dur="4.889">create and modify the statistical</text>
  <text start="821.019" dur="3.87">numbers and people would they look at</text>
  <text start="823.269" dur="4.291">them believe the economy&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="824.889" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s very easy to continually push the</text>
  <text start="827.56" dur="4.68">stock market up and to print a lot of</text>
  <text start="830.139" dur="3.63">currency or just push a button and then</text>
  <text start="832.24" dur="3.42">pass it along to banks to make it look</text>
  <text start="833.769" dur="4.17">like everything is great it&amp;#39;s very easy</text>
  <text start="835.66" dur="4.32">to create a stress test which is</text>
  <text start="837.939" dur="3.541">absolutely meaningless put it out in the</text>
  <text start="839.98" dur="3.539">mainstream media and tell people this is</text>
  <text start="841.48" dur="3.779">very important they passed the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="843.519" dur="4.92">passed the stress test so that means</text>
  <text start="845.259" dur="6.091">they are strong no it doesn&amp;#39;t just like</text>
  <text start="848.439" dur="4.741">s P and the rest the rest of the rating</text>
  <text start="851.35" dur="4.109">agency said the subprime securities were</text>
  <text start="853.18" dur="4.709">triple-a rated were they</text>
  <text start="855.459" dur="4.5">No so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="857.889" dur="3.661">headed towards this transition the</text>
  <text start="859.959" dur="2.761">central banks now a back peddling</text>

  <text start="873.309" dur="5.161">happen but it&amp;#39;s too late for that</text>
