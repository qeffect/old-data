  <text start="86.34" dur="4.889">financial news now we know the deep</text>
  <text start="89.01" dur="6.39">State the central bankers they were</text>
  <text start="91.229" dur="7.681">trying to do one of two things one they</text>
  <text start="95.4" dur="5.79">were trying to bring illegals into this</text>
  <text start="98.91" dur="3.27">country to increase the population of</text>
  <text start="101.19" dur="2.55">this country and there are many</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="3.63">different agendas associated with this</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="4.83">and then we&amp;#39;re trying to do the same</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="7.59">thing throughout Europe why because the</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="6.87">economy needs the population to grow the</text>
  <text start="113.4" dur="5.4">other thing they were trying to do if</text>
  <text start="115.44" dur="5.91">that didn&amp;#39;t work they were trying to</text>
  <text start="118.8" dur="4.5">create some type of an event which would</text>
  <text start="121.35" dur="4.71">actually lead to a war which would</text>
  <text start="123.3" dur="5.34">decrease the population which would then</text>
  <text start="126.06" dur="5.789">allow it to grow once again</text>
  <text start="128.64" dur="6.87">I think about this for a second the</text>
  <text start="131.849" dur="9.261">central bank system needs the population</text>
  <text start="135.51" dur="10.17">to continually grow otherwise it stalls</text>
  <text start="141.11" dur="8.409">otherwise the debt well it cannot be</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="5.479">sustained the entire system and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="149.519" dur="6.571">talking about the central bank system</text>
  <text start="151.159" dur="7.691">it&amp;#39;s dependent on a population that is</text>
  <text start="156.09" dur="6.93">continually growing at a certain pace</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="4.94">and when a central bank system doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="163.02" dur="4.999">have the</text>
  <text start="163.79" dur="6.39">ingredient the system implodes because</text>
  <text start="168.019" dur="3.631">it cannot operate and this is a this is</text>
  <text start="170.18" dur="6.089">the problem with the central bank system</text>
  <text start="171.65" dur="7.919">and Steven Chu and Nobel laureate outed</text>
  <text start="176.269" dur="4.44">the central bank and reveals the secret</text>
  <text start="179.569" dur="3.931">which we&amp;#39;re gonna be getting into in</text>
  <text start="180.709" dur="5.071">just a moment but first let&amp;#39;s start</text>
  <text start="183.5" dur="5.42">looking at the economy here and we know</text>
  <text start="185.78" dur="6.39">that this economy is being propped up by</text>
  <text start="188.92" dur="5.409">Trump of the Patriots we know that he</text>
  <text start="192.17" dur="4.379">needs to do this to put everything in</text>
  <text start="194.329" dur="5">place because this entire economic</text>
  <text start="196.549" dur="7.261">system is going to look very different</text>
  <text start="199.329" dur="7.181">after the entire system comes down and a</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="5.31">new one is put into its place we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="4.97">gonna have the Federal Reserve Note it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.12" dur="5.33">not going to be a petrol dollar</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="5.679">everything&amp;#39;s not gonna be based on oil</text>
  <text start="214.45" dur="5.739">trade is not going to be based on oil</text>
  <text start="217.159" dur="6.211">and the system is not going to be run as</text>
  <text start="220.189" dur="6.3">a center a private western central bank</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="5.609">system but when you look at the economy</text>
  <text start="226.489" dur="4.731">you can see their sister and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="228.979" dur="4.29">about the central bank system it is</text>
  <text start="231.22" dur="5.439">imploding right in front of horizon</text>
  <text start="233.269" dur="6.3">Trump is using all their tools their</text>
  <text start="236.659" dur="5.401">manipulation to keep the system alive if</text>
  <text start="239.569" dur="6.051">you look at housing once again remember</text>
  <text start="242.06" dur="7.049">he cannot allow housing to collapse</text>
  <text start="245.62" dur="6.759">because if he lets housing go it goes</text>
  <text start="249.109" dur="4.951">into many other industries and the</text>
  <text start="252.379" dur="4.23">people who own their homes</text>
  <text start="254.06" dur="5.19">well they don&amp;#39;t feel confident in the</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="4.5">economic system because as the housing</text>
  <text start="259.25" dur="5.039">market comes down all the houses</text>
  <text start="261.109" dur="6.721">depreciate people lose their investments</text>
  <text start="264.289" dur="5.791">he cannot allow this to happen and since</text>
  <text start="267.83" dur="5.91">the Fed right now under the patriot</text>
  <text start="270.08" dur="7.19">control they have kept the rates stable</text>
  <text start="273.74" dur="7.049">in 2019 but with the housing market</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="6.73">declining as quickly as it is I believe</text>
  <text start="280.789" dur="6.961">the Fed might have to cut rates so we</text>
  <text start="284" dur="8.25">can get through 2020 if you look at the</text>
  <text start="287.75" dur="7.02">sales of homes home purchases fell in</text>
  <text start="292.25" dur="4.79">all four regions led by a 7.9 percent</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="5.32">drop in the Midwest this</text>
  <text start="297.04" dur="7.83">the 13th straight month of annual</text>
  <text start="300.09" dur="8.89">existing home sales declines and we see</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="6.57">that to prop this up once again I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="308.98" dur="5.55">think it&amp;#39;s just good enough to keep the</text>
  <text start="311.44" dur="6.81">rate stable I do believe that Trump is</text>
  <text start="314.53" dur="5.55">now going to push for cutting the rates</text>
  <text start="318.25" dur="3.75">and I believe is gonna start tweeting</text>
  <text start="320.08" dur="3.27">this out and actually this is the</text>
  <text start="322" dur="2.99">perfect time to do it because remember</text>
  <text start="323.35" dur="5.1">we talked about this many times before</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="8.08">the best time for a housing is the</text>
  <text start="328.45" dur="6.81">spring and summer everyone&amp;#39;s coming off</text>
  <text start="333.07" dur="4.89">of school the weather is getting better</text>
  <text start="335.26" dur="4.65">the flowers come out it&amp;#39;s great for</text>
  <text start="337.96" dur="5.16">moving and people want to be in their</text>
  <text start="339.91" dur="5.43">homes before school starts once again</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="3.6">and a lot of people move during this</text>
  <text start="345.34" dur="3.84">time because it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to move</text>
  <text start="346.72" dur="4.08">during the summer than it is in the</text>
  <text start="349.18" dur="5.1">winter when you have snow ice and other</text>
  <text start="350.8" dur="5.61">things like that if he sees what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.28" dur="4.41">happening which I believe he does and</text>
  <text start="356.41" dur="5.55">his people around him sees what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.69" dur="5.55">happening he&amp;#39;s going to push the Fed to</text>
  <text start="361.96" dur="4.2">start cutting rates and I believe</text>
  <text start="364.24" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re going to have to do this within</text>
  <text start="366.16" dur="5.28">this spring time period and we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="369.34" dur="3.27">to see how this all plays out now</text>
  <text start="371.44" dur="2.55">something very interesting we know</text>
  <text start="372.61" dur="2.61">there&amp;#39;s many different individuals that</text>
  <text start="373.99" dur="3.84">are running for president and we know</text>
  <text start="375.22" dur="4.38">that Elizabeth Warren who is not really</text>
  <text start="377.83" dur="3.84">a Native American at all she kind of</text>
  <text start="379.6" dur="4.38">lied about the whole thing got into law</text>
  <text start="381.67" dur="2.85">school by saying that she was a Native</text>
  <text start="383.98" dur="3.69">American</text>
  <text start="384.52" dur="3.9">she took a DNA test and she&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="387.67" dur="3.99">Native American</text>
  <text start="388.42" dur="7.5">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that she</text>
  <text start="391.66" dur="8.19">is proposing a 640 billion student debt</text>
  <text start="395.92" dur="5.7">forgiveness free college now think about</text>
  <text start="399.85" dur="3.51">what she&amp;#39;s doing of course she&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="401.62" dur="4.02">this to get elected I mean that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="5.1">completely obvious is she ever gonna get</text>
  <text start="405.64" dur="4.29">this done most likely not because first</text>
  <text start="408.46" dur="3.87">of all she&amp;#39;s not gonna be President but</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="6.12">even if she was there&amp;#39;s no way that this</text>
  <text start="412.33" dur="7.32">was going to happen the problem with all</text>
  <text start="416.05" dur="5.55">of this is that we need to go to the</text>
  <text start="419.65" dur="5.94">root of the problem this is not a fix</text>
  <text start="421.6" dur="6.39">this is a ploy to get elected yeah</text>
  <text start="425.59" dur="4.35">people will feel great but get guess</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="2.79">what it&amp;#39;s almost like the minimum wage</text>
  <text start="429.94" dur="4.23">raise</text>
  <text start="430.78" dur="5.55">it doesn&amp;#39;t fix anything it sounds great</text>
  <text start="434.17" dur="4.41">until you experience it and you say yeah</text>
  <text start="436.33" dur="4.56">this did not help because here I am once</text>
  <text start="438.58" dur="4.94">again a couple years later back to where</text>
  <text start="440.89" dur="5.16">we started she tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="443.52" dur="4.39">student loan debt is crushing millions</text>
  <text start="446.05" dur="3.89">of families that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m calling for</text>
  <text start="447.91" dur="4.5">something truly transformational</text>
  <text start="449.94" dur="4.72">universal free college and the</text>
  <text start="452.41" dur="3.81">cancellation of debt for more than 95</text>
  <text start="454.66" dur="5.07">percent of Americans with student loan</text>
  <text start="456.22" dur="6.18">debt read all about it here ok first of</text>
  <text start="459.73" dur="5.4">all who&amp;#39;s paying for all this we know</text>
  <text start="462.4" dur="5.43">that the government cannot pay any more</text>
  <text start="465.13" dur="5.46">of this the taxpayers right now can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.83" dur="5.46">pay for any of this because there is</text>
  <text start="470.59" dur="5.94">just too much debt so someone&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="473.29" dur="6.44">have to pay for this and guess what it</text>
  <text start="476.53" dur="5.13">will be all the taxpayers in the country</text>
  <text start="479.73" dur="3.91">will this fix anything</text>
  <text start="481.66" dur="5.58">no you&amp;#39;re just shifting the problem</text>
  <text start="483.64" dur="6.36">that&amp;#39;s all you&amp;#39;re doing what needs to be</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="5.94">done is we need to go to the root of the</text>
  <text start="490" dur="6.96">problem why do we need student loans to</text>
  <text start="493.18" dur="8.69">get into college why do we need loans to</text>
  <text start="496.96" dur="8.63">purchase a house a car or even finance</text>
  <text start="501.87" dur="7.54">washers and dryers I mean in the past</text>
  <text start="505.59" dur="6.579">people used to use cash to pay for these</text>
  <text start="509.41" dur="5.1">things I mean I was in a phone store the</text>
  <text start="512.169" dur="4.861">other day and I saw you can finance the</text>
  <text start="514.51" dur="5.73">charger for the phone which is just</text>
  <text start="517.03" dur="5.639">unbelievable the problem that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="520.24" dur="5.01">having today is that the dollar is</text>
  <text start="522.669" dur="5.731">continually losing value and if it</text>
  <text start="525.25" dur="5.1">continually loses value guess what</text>
  <text start="528.4" dur="3.56">you&amp;#39;re never gonna fix the problem</text>
  <text start="530.35" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;re gonna need more and more loans</text>
  <text start="531.96" dur="3.82">that&amp;#39;s why we need to go back to the</text>
  <text start="534.37" dur="4.41">root of the problem I mean look at</text>
  <text start="535.78" dur="5.55">Social Security for instance this is not</text>
  <text start="538.78" dur="5.22">the government&amp;#39;s money everyone that</text>
  <text start="541.33" dur="5.43">works contributes to Social Security</text>
  <text start="544" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s a retirement plan that you are</text>
  <text start="546.76" dur="4.71">putting money into the system and then</text>
  <text start="549.37" dur="5.73">when you retire you get this money back</text>
  <text start="551.47" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s like a forced retirement plan it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.1" dur="3.06">like if you started a private one it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.45" dur="4.59">the same type of thing the government</text>
  <text start="558.16" dur="6.38">has been borrowing or taking the money</text>
  <text start="561.04" dur="6.35">out of the Social Security</text>
  <text start="564.54" dur="5.22">counts and using it for other things and</text>
  <text start="567.39" dur="4.53">now we find out that the trustees report</text>
  <text start="569.76" dur="4.77">came out and social security fund will</text>
  <text start="571.92" dur="5.22">go negative in 2020 so what does this</text>
  <text start="574.53" dur="6.09">mean well the social securities program</text>
  <text start="577.14" dur="7.07">cost will exceed its income in 2020 for</text>
  <text start="580.62" dur="7.68">the first time since 1982</text>
  <text start="584.21" dur="6.88">the system is buckling under the weight</text>
  <text start="588.3" dur="5.31">it cannot continue on in this fashion</text>
  <text start="591.09" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible but those</text>
  <text start="593.61" dur="5.79">individuals that don&amp;#39;t want to let this</text>
  <text start="596.61" dur="5.49">system go they&amp;#39;re pushing back remember</text>
  <text start="599.4" dur="5.58">Trump would would like to have Herman</text>
  <text start="602.1" dur="6.21">came and Steven Moore nominated and put</text>
  <text start="604.98" dur="5.58">into the Fed we see already that there</text>
  <text start="608.31" dur="3.99">are Republicans out there that do not</text>
  <text start="610.56" dur="4.65">want Herman Cain remember these</text>
  <text start="612.3" dur="4.94">individuals they take their instruction</text>
  <text start="615.21" dur="4.2">from the central bank the bad</text>
  <text start="617.24" dur="2.74">individuals within the central bank am I</text>
  <text start="619.41" dur="3.06">talking about</text>
  <text start="619.98" dur="5.4">the good people there there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s split</text>
  <text start="622.47" dur="5.1">Trump is bringing in people to basically</text>
  <text start="625.38" dur="3.84">restructure at the entire system there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="627.57" dur="3.21">still bad people just like within</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="3.66">government there was a deep state and</text>
  <text start="630.78" dur="3.81">Trump came in and he&amp;#39;s restructuring the</text>
  <text start="632.88" dur="4.8">government it&amp;#39;s the same thing with the</text>
  <text start="634.59" dur="6.03">central bank and we see that Herman Cain</text>
  <text start="637.68" dur="4.92">he does not have a chance I mean Trump</text>
  <text start="640.62" dur="4.14">tweeted out the following my friend</text>
  <text start="642.6" dur="4.74">Herman Cain a truly truly wonderful man</text>
  <text start="644.76" dur="4.23">has asked me not to nominate him for a</text>
  <text start="647.34" dur="4.05">seat on the Federal Reserve Board I will</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="5.76">respect his wishes Herman is a great</text>
  <text start="651.39" dur="6.21">American who truly loves our country so</text>
  <text start="654.75" dur="6.75">now we need to look at who is not voting</text>
  <text start="657.6" dur="7.19">for him and we see that Senator Kevin</text>
  <text start="661.5" dur="8.4">Cramer he said he will not vote for Cain</text>
  <text start="664.79" dur="8.41">Mitt Romney Lisa Murkowski and Cory</text>
  <text start="669.9" dur="6.84">Gardner now Lisa Murkowski is controlled</text>
  <text start="673.2" dur="6.42">by Feinstein Romney well he&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="676.74" dur="6.15">against Trump and you can see how they</text>
  <text start="679.62" dur="3.81">are stopping him they know what he&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="682.89" dur="3.66">to</text>
  <text start="683.43" dur="5.88">they know that restructuring is coming</text>
  <text start="686.55" dur="4.26">and just because we don&amp;#39;t get Herman</text>
  <text start="689.31" dur="4.02">Cain or Steven Moore well Steve Moore</text>
  <text start="690.81" dur="4.47">he&amp;#39;s still in the running even though we</text>
  <text start="693.33" dur="4.49">don&amp;#39;t get these individuals he will</text>
  <text start="695.28" dur="5.45">bring up other individuals and</text>
  <text start="697.82" dur="6.86">he will get the people he needs in the</text>
  <text start="700.73" dur="8.19">Federal Reserve to restructure it now</text>
  <text start="704.68" dur="7.75">Nobel laureate Steven Chu came out and</text>
  <text start="708.92" dur="6.3">he said a couple of things about this</text>
  <text start="712.43" dur="6.29">economy he said the world economy is</text>
  <text start="715.22" dur="6.3">based on ever increasing population a</text>
  <text start="718.72" dur="5.11">scheme that economists don&amp;#39;t talk about</text>
  <text start="721.52" dur="5.1">and the government&amp;#39;s won&amp;#39;t face a scheme</text>
  <text start="723.83" dur="6.36">that makes sustainability impossible and</text>
  <text start="726.62" dur="5.79">that is likely to eventually fail he</text>
  <text start="730.19" dur="4.47">said the world needs a new model of how</text>
  <text start="732.41" dur="5.01">to generate a rising standard of living</text>
  <text start="734.66" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s not dependent on a pyramid scheme</text>
  <text start="737.42" dur="4.86">now that&amp;#39;s very interesting that he said</text>
  <text start="739.76" dur="4.83">a pyramid scheme now he really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="742.28" dur="4.8">specify what that new model was gonna</text>
  <text start="744.59" dur="4.98">look like but he offers a solution to</text>
  <text start="747.08" dur="3.33">the population growth that we rely on</text>
  <text start="749.57" dur="3.69">right now</text>
  <text start="750.41" dur="4.71">he said increased economic prosperity in</text>
  <text start="753.26" dur="3.45">all economic models supported by</text>
  <text start="755.12" dur="3.21">governments and global competitors are</text>
  <text start="756.71" dur="4.47">based on having more young people</text>
  <text start="758.33" dur="4.68">workers than older people two schemes</text>
  <text start="761.18" dur="4.98">come to mind one is the pyramid scheme</text>
  <text start="763.01" dur="5.43">the other is a Ponzi scheme I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="766.16" dur="4.59">going to explain them but you can look</text>
  <text start="768.44" dur="2.55">them up and you can find out what they</text>
  <text start="770.75" dur="2.58">are</text>
  <text start="770.99" dur="4.88">he said depending on a pyramid scheme or</text>
  <text start="773.33" dur="5.19">a Ponzi scheme there&amp;#39;s no such thing as</text>
  <text start="775.87" dur="5.35">sustainability there are at least two</text>
  <text start="778.52" dur="4.32">problems with it depending on a pyramid</text>
  <text start="781.22" dur="3.96">scheme or a Ponzi scheme there is no</text>
  <text start="782.84" dur="4.47">such thing as sustainability as</text>
  <text start="785.18" dur="4.41">standards of living increase population</text>
  <text start="787.31" dur="3.93">growth declines so if the economy</text>
  <text start="789.59" dur="4.92">succeeds in raising standards of living</text>
  <text start="791.24" dur="5.04">it undermines itself the economists know</text>
  <text start="794.51" dur="3.69">this but they don&amp;#39;t really talk about it</text>
  <text start="796.28" dur="3.99">in the open and there&amp;#39;s really no</text>
  <text start="798.2" dur="3.45">discussion in government every</text>
  <text start="800.27" dur="3.51">government says you have to have an</text>
  <text start="801.65" dur="4.44">increase in population whether you do it</text>
  <text start="803.78" dur="5.37">through immigrants or the home</text>
  <text start="806.09" dur="5.51">population so this is a problem now</text>
  <text start="809.15" dur="4.83">think about what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="811.6" dur="4.39">what was the deep state and the central</text>
  <text start="813.98" dur="4.11">bankers trying to do throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="815.99" dur="6.18">and in the United States they were</text>
  <text start="818.09" dur="5.76">trying to bring illegals in why because</text>
  <text start="822.17" dur="3.33">they needed to increase the population</text>
  <text start="823.85" dur="3.57">yes this is one agenda they had many</text>
  <text start="825.5" dur="4.83">agendas associated with this because it</text>
  <text start="827.42" dur="3.78">helps their system the same thing in</text>
  <text start="830.33" dur="2.91">Europe they</text>
  <text start="831.2" dur="4.77">all these countries the European</text>
  <text start="833.24" dur="4.89">countries to accept immigrants not just</text>
  <text start="835.97" dur="6.03">one country the whole block</text>
  <text start="838.13" dur="7.23">why because their system would not be</text>
  <text start="842" dur="6.03">able to continue without this this is</text>
  <text start="845.36" dur="6.87">the problem with a central bank system</text>
  <text start="848.03" dur="5.39">now if Clinton came into office this</text>
  <text start="852.23" dur="4.68">would be a little bit different because</text>
  <text start="853.42" dur="7">they would then depend on an event this</text>
  <text start="856.91" dur="6.27">event would bring us to war war would</text>
  <text start="860.42" dur="4.64">decrease the population and what the</text>
  <text start="863.18" dur="5.46">central bankers could do is they could</text>
  <text start="865.06" dur="6.64">reset the system and start it all over</text>
  <text start="868.64" dur="4.92">again and what would you have if you</text>
  <text start="871.7" dur="3.42">have a decrease in population with war</text>
  <text start="873.56" dur="3.93">and you reset the system</text>
  <text start="875.12" dur="3.3">you have population growth this is what</text>
  <text start="877.49" dur="4.14">their system needs</text>
  <text start="878.42" dur="6.66">so without Clinton they have to depend</text>
  <text start="881.63" dur="6.48">on the illegals coming into the country</text>
  <text start="885.08" dur="4.86">to keep the system operational and I</text>
  <text start="888.11" dur="4.32">believe they were bringing the illegals</text>
  <text start="889.94" dur="5.19">into all over the place until they have</text>
  <text start="892.43" dur="4.8">the event move forward now they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="895.13" dur="7.11">have that event and what is Trump doing</text>
  <text start="897.23" dur="8.31">so Trump is building a wall which stops</text>
  <text start="902.24" dur="5.31">the flow of illegals guess who doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="905.54" dur="3.09">like this well the deep state because</text>
  <text start="907.55" dur="3.18">there&amp;#39;s drug trafficking human</text>
  <text start="908.63" dur="5.87">trafficking they can&amp;#39;t get their votes</text>
  <text start="910.73" dur="7.5">the central bankers can&amp;#39;t increase the</text>
  <text start="914.5" dur="7.74">population so Trump is hitting them from</text>
  <text start="918.23" dur="7.02">all sides look at the nations in Europe</text>
  <text start="922.24" dur="5.8">they&amp;#39;re putting up barriers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="925.25" dur="6.06">want the population to grow they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="928.04" dur="6.33">stopping the central bank like I said</text>
  <text start="931.31" dur="6.9">before the central bank is completely</text>
  <text start="934.37" dur="6.75">exposed right now no event no population</text>
  <text start="938.21" dur="4.83">growth which means their system while</text>
  <text start="941.12" dur="4.95">everyone&amp;#39;s staring at them comes</text>
  <text start="943.04" dur="6">crashing down and there&amp;#39;s nothing they</text>
  <text start="946.07" dur="5.85">can do about it at this time and Trump</text>
  <text start="949.04" dur="7.23">and many other leaders they are pushing</text>
  <text start="951.92" dur="6.36">for a completely new system completely</text>
  <text start="956.27" dur="4.2">separate and apart from the private</text>
  <text start="958.28" dur="5.55">western central bank system that system</text>
  <text start="960.47" dur="4.41">is going to go away so think about what</text>
  <text start="963.83" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="964.88" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re in the Middle East the central</text>
  <text start="967.88" dur="4.37">bankers couldn&amp;#39;t expand the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="970.19" dur="4.44">in the Middle East now it&amp;#39;s contracting</text>
  <text start="972.25" dur="3.85">Trump is putting up the wall stopping</text>
  <text start="974.63" dur="3.959">the illegals coming to the country</text>
  <text start="976.1" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s no population growth many of the</text>
  <text start="978.589" dur="4.11">countries in the European law they are</text>
  <text start="980.75" dur="2.43">stopping the illegals from coming into</text>
  <text start="982.699" dur="3.901">the country</text>
  <text start="983.18" dur="6.57">Soros wanted to bring individuals from</text>
  <text start="986.6" dur="5.13">Africa into Europe why to push</text>
  <text start="989.75" dur="4.399">population growth to keep the system</text>
  <text start="991.73" dur="6.539">alive because they know they&amp;#39;re exposed</text>
  <text start="994.149" dur="5.68">Trump and many other individuals around</text>
  <text start="998.269" dur="4.68">the world who are leaders of countries</text>
  <text start="999.829" dur="5.19">they are putting the brakes on the</text>
  <text start="1002.949" dur="5.101">private western central bank system and</text>
  <text start="1005.019" dur="6.421">they&amp;#39;re making sure that it is</text>
  <text start="1008.05" dur="6.959">completely closed off so when it goes</text>
  <text start="1011.44" dur="5.699">down they can&amp;#39;t do anything about it and</text>
  <text start="1015.009" dur="4.801">they&amp;#39;re completely exposed because they</text>
  <text start="1017.139" dur="5.82">don&amp;#39;t have the event they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
