  <text start="255.069" dur="7.13">in 2013 the US government got rid of</text>
  <text start="259.599" dur="6.241">that department that counts layoffs</text>
  <text start="262.199" dur="6.701">because of budget constraints we see</text>

  <text start="329.629" dur="5.1">back their stock why were they doing</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="7.5">this because sales are continually</text>
  <text start="334.729" dur="8.611">declining 32 consecutive months of</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="6.18">declining global retail sales and over a</text>
  <text start="343.34" dur="4.979">year longer than the decline observed</text>
  <text start="345.77" dur="4.169">during the great financial crisis so</text>
  <text start="348.319" dur="3.69">right now during the great recession</text>
  <text start="349.939" dur="5.66">that started back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="352.009" dur="9.12">they went 19 months with declining sales</text>
  <text start="355.599" dur="12.761">now it&amp;#39;s been 32 months since the end of</text>
  <text start="361.129" dur="8.94">2012 this is the recovery and if we look</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="4.83">at the information a little bit closer</text>
  <text start="370.069" dur="5.4">we see Asia drop from nineteen percent</text>
  <text start="373.19" dur="4.83">down to twenty-five percent it got worse</text>
  <text start="375.469" dur="5.491">North America slid to negative five</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="4.41">percent Latin America is a little bit</text>
  <text start="380.96" dur="3">more positive instead of negative fifty</text>
  <text start="382.43" dur="7.769">percent it&amp;#39;s only negative thirty seven</text>
  <text start="383.96" dur="13.889">percent this is horrible how can this</text>
  <text start="390.199" dur="11.551">system continue on well we know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="397.849" dur="6.84">a people driven economy we know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="401.75" dur="5.58">central bank economy and then they can</text>
  <text start="404.689" dur="5.15">as long as they can continually pump up</text>
  <text start="407.33" dur="7.32">the bubbles they&amp;#39;re going to do this</text>
  <text start="409.839" dur="7.39">they&amp;#39;re going to do it until they get</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="4.5">that special event started where</text>
  <text start="417.229" dur="4.351">everything is blamed on another country</text>
  <text start="419.15" dur="5.759">or group for this total collapse of the</text>
  <text start="421.58" dur="6.48">system I mean we had existing home sales</text>
  <text start="424.909" dur="4.471">come out today and I see it all over the</text>
  <text start="428.06" dur="3.28">corporate media it&amp;#39;s the highest since</text>
  <text start="429.38" dur="4.66">februari of 2007 this</text>
  <text start="431.34" dur="4.049">is incredible but when we look at this</text>
  <text start="434.04" dur="5.28">we see the national association of</text>
  <text start="435.389" dur="5.28">realtors basically kind of manipulated</text>
  <text start="439.32" dur="5.01">the numbers they had a little seasonal</text>
  <text start="440.669" dur="5.97">adjustments and basically what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="4.98">seeing here is that the sales were</text>
  <text start="446.639" dur="4.53">completely manipulated think about this</text>
  <text start="449.31" dur="4.919">for a second they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="451.169" dur="5.03">existing home sales are going up but</text>
  <text start="454.229" dur="7.41">mortgage applications are at all-time</text>
  <text start="456.199" dur="8.171">lows how can this be are you trying to</text>
  <text start="461.639" dur="4.801">tell me that all these people in the</text>
  <text start="464.37" dur="4.5">United States have all this cash on hand</text>
  <text start="466.44" dur="6.66">and they&amp;#39;re just pouring it into real</text>
  <text start="468.87" dur="8.18">estate when we look closer at this we</text>
  <text start="473.1" dur="7.89">see investment companies hedge funds</text>
  <text start="477.05" dur="8.52">continually purchasing homes with cash</text>
  <text start="480.99" dur="7.739">foreign investors purchasing with cash</text>
  <text start="485.57" dur="6.099">the American people they&amp;#39;re not buying</text>
  <text start="488.729" dur="6.121">these homes all of these homes are being</text>
  <text start="491.669" dur="4.831">kept off the market and we have to</text>
  <text start="494.85" dur="4.68">remember the national association of</text>
  <text start="496.5" dur="7.47">realtors continually manipulate data or</text>
  <text start="499.53" dur="6.66">they come out with certain remarks about</text>
  <text start="503.97" dur="4.77">how the real estate market is actually</text>
  <text start="506.19" dur="4.56">doing if we go back in time and we look</text>
  <text start="508.74" dur="4.169">at what Lawrence yen has said and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="510.75" dur="6.479">gone over this before if we go back to</text>
  <text start="512.909" dur="7.94">July thirty-first 2007 home prices are</text>
  <text start="517.229" dur="6.391">falling we are encouraged at home prices</text>
  <text start="520.849" dur="5.141">at least for now have stopped declining</text>
  <text start="523.62" dur="6.18">said lawrence yun if we go back to</text>
  <text start="525.99" dur="6.18">october eleventh two thousand seven the</text>
  <text start="529.8" dur="4.26">speculative excesses have been removed</text>
  <text start="532.17" dur="3.48">from the market and home sales are</text>
  <text start="534.06" dur="4.02">returning to fundamentally healthy</text>
  <text start="535.65" dur="6.96">levels while prices remain near record</text>
  <text start="538.08" dur="7.68">highs he&amp;#39;s trying to tell us back in</text>
  <text start="542.61" dur="5.64">2007 that homes are going to do a lot</text>
  <text start="545.76" dur="5.78">better as time goes on but what happened</text>
  <text start="548.25" dur="7.589">the entire thing fell apart July tenth</text>
  <text start="551.54" dur="6.19">2008 I mean January tenth 2008 stable</text>
  <text start="555.839" dur="4.611">existing home sales expected in early</text>
  <text start="557.73" dur="5.16">two thousand eight then a gradual rise a</text>
  <text start="560.45" dur="4.81">meaningful recovery in existing home</text>
  <text start="562.89" dur="4.41">sales could occur as early as the</text>
  <text start="565.26" dur="5.84">spring did we see a recovery back in two</text>
  <text start="567.3" dur="6.12">thousand eight no we did not</text>
  <text start="571.1" dur="6.34">fast-forward to September twentieth of</text>
  <text start="573.42" dur="6.06">2008 Yun also said that he expects the</text>
  <text start="577.44" dur="4.59">worst of the housing slowdown is over or</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="4.98">nearly so the winter months are always</text>
  <text start="582.03" dur="6.57">weaker but this winter in 2008 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.46" dur="7.56">going to be much much stronger and of</text>
  <text start="588.6" dur="6.75">course in June twenty-second of 2015 no</text>
  <text start="592.02" dur="7.14">the the real estate markets not in a</text>
  <text start="595.35" dur="6.65">bubble it&amp;#39;s clearly not a bubble we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="599.16" dur="5.85">just seeing higher prices more sales</text>
  <text start="602" dur="6.4">well what are we really seeing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.01" dur="6.06">seeing none of this I again have been</text>
  <text start="608.4" dur="5.58">looking around this country and I have</text>
  <text start="611.07" dur="5.4">been having people email me now saying</text>
  <text start="613.98" dur="5.94">okay I thought you were wrong before and</text>
  <text start="616.47" dur="6.48">guess what I am now seeing home prices</text>
  <text start="619.92" dur="5.52">come down actually some people have</text>
  <text start="622.95" dur="5.69">bought homes and they&amp;#39;re trying to sell</text>
  <text start="625.44" dur="5.4">it a year later and they can&amp;#39;t sell them</text>
  <text start="628.64" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re continually reducing their</text>
  <text start="630.84" dur="6.87">prices they&amp;#39;re having a problem the</text>
  <text start="633.51" dur="8.73">traffic is drying up we&amp;#39;re at the stage</text>
  <text start="637.71" dur="7.76">we were in 2008 it is not getting better</text>
  <text start="642.24" dur="7.08">and it&amp;#39;s not going to get better for</text>
  <text start="645.47" dur="7">pretty much everybody I mean think about</text>
  <text start="649.32" dur="7.08">this think about how many people lost</text>
  <text start="652.47" dur="5.78">their retirement during 2008 lost a lot</text>
  <text start="656.4" dur="5.64">of their wealth their homes their jobs</text>
  <text start="658.25" dur="6.97">and now it&amp;#39;s what seven eight years</text>
  <text start="662.04" dur="5.79">later many of those people are retiring</text>
  <text start="665.22" dur="4.97">and without their retirement what do</text>
  <text start="667.83" dur="5.58">they do they have to go back to work</text>
  <text start="670.19" dur="6.46">actually a recent analysis found that</text>
  <text start="673.41" dur="5.03">half of us households 55 and older have</text>
  <text start="676.65" dur="6.36">no money stashed away for retirement</text>
  <text start="678.44" dur="8.86">whatsoever half of Americans oh no</text>
  <text start="683.01" dur="5.88">stocks at all the idea that all older</text>
  <text start="687.3" dur="4.56">Americans own their home free and clear</text>
  <text start="688.89" dur="5.4">is simply not true anymore only</text>
  <text start="691.86" dur="5.37">thirty-five percent on their home free</text>
  <text start="694.29" dur="4.3">and clear from debt and this is not</text>
  <text start="697.23" dur="3.91">including taxes</text>
  <text start="698.59" dur="4.35">insurance and maintenance twenty-four</text>
  <text start="701.14" dur="4.05">percent are still saddled with mortgage</text>
  <text start="702.94" dur="6.89">debt and forty-one percent do not own a</text>
  <text start="705.19" dur="7.32">home meaning they have to pay rent and</text>
  <text start="709.83" dur="6.91">of course their wages are not going up</text>
  <text start="712.51" dur="7.35">but rent is the median net worth four a</text>
  <text start="716.74" dur="9">55 and older is 34 thousand seven</text>
  <text start="719.86" dur="10.11">hundred and sixty dollars what is going</text>
  <text start="725.74" dur="7.53">on here this system this economy that</text>
  <text start="729.97" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re living in is not helping the older</text>
  <text start="733.27" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s not helping the younger it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="735.85" dur="6.08">helping the middle it&amp;#39;s helping no one</text>
  <text start="738.64" dur="6.69">right now and most of these people are</text>
  <text start="741.93" dur="5.38">having a very rough time making it this</text>
  <text start="745.33" dur="3.41">is why we see them going back to work</text>
  <text start="747.31" dur="5.66">getting one or two part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="748.74" dur="9.58">because as we know there is inflation on</text>
  <text start="752.97" dur="8.8">food living expenses and everything else</text>
  <text start="758.32" dur="8.13">and think about the youth of America who</text>
  <text start="761.77" dur="7.61">saddled with student loan debt who can&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="847.839" dur="3.271">is looking at it saying okay yeah</text>
  <text start="849.43" dur="4.56">something is going on with the economy</text>
  <text start="851.11" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re kind of admitting certain things</text>

  <text start="858.7" dur="4.71">started to admit it during that point in</text>
  <text start="861.19" dur="3.66">time because now they&amp;#39;re backed into a</text>
  <text start="863.41" dur="3.21">corner and they have to say something</text>
  <text start="864.85" dur="3.21">because a lot of people saying what</text>
  <text start="866.62" dur="3.54">you&amp;#39;re telling me doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>

  <text start="1028.709" dur="7.44">September 13 2015 I mean if we look at</text>
  <text start="1034.53" dur="4.559">all this evidence and we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1036.149" dur="4.731">coming here we know from all the</text>
  <text start="1039.089" dur="5.941">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="1040.88" dur="10.09">from the past up until now we know this</text>
  <text start="1045.03" dur="9.69">is not going to work out it the system</text>
  <text start="1050.97" dur="7.38">will completely collapse and fall apart</text>
  <text start="1054.72" dur="7.199">now this system right now that&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="1058.35" dur="7.65">apart we all need to be prepared for</text>
  <text start="1061.919" dur="6.87">what is coming just like you prepare for</text>
  <text start="1066" dur="5.97">everything else there&amp;#39;s no difference</text>
  <text start="1068.789" dur="4.831">here we know it&amp;#39;s coming it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1071.97" dur="4.26">mathematical fact that this system</text>
  <text start="1073.62" dur="6.779">cannot go on I mean look out in the</text>
  <text start="1076.23" dur="6.03">Middle East we see everything completely</text>
  <text start="1080.399" dur="5.071">falling apart and remember the petro</text>
  <text start="1082.26" dur="5.13">dollar system was created back in 1971</text>
  <text start="1085.47" dur="5.13">as we came off the gold standard to</text>
  <text start="1087.39" dur="7.11">support the dollar and as more and more</text>
  <text start="1090.6" dur="5.699">countries rise up the petro dollar is</text>
  <text start="1094.5" dur="5.06">threatened if the petrodollar is</text>
  <text start="1096.299" dur="6.991">threatened and removed from the system</text>
  <text start="1099.56" dur="5.17">guess what this system cannot survive</text>
  <text start="1103.29" dur="3.72">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="1104.73" dur="5.22">this is why John Kerry was out there</text>
  <text start="1107.01" dur="4.86">telling us if the Iran deal which has</text>
  <text start="1109.95" dur="6.48">nothing to do with nuclear weapons does</text>
  <text start="1111.87" dur="6.93">not go through we&amp;#39;re doomed so this is</text>
  <text start="1116.43" dur="5.76">why I continually say everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="1118.8" dur="7.05">be prepared if you&amp;#39;re stocking up on</text>

  <text start="1139.26" dur="5.25">what will happen is people are going to</text>
  <text start="1142.22" dur="4">basically become desperate because</text>
  <text start="1144.51" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re going to realize okay the</text>
  <text start="1146.22" dur="5.85">dollars crashing food is wiped out on</text>
