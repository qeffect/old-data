  <text start="587.25" dur="8.1">this has been set up going back in time</text>

  <text start="607.8" dur="5.1">agreements or whatever they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="609.15" dur="5.7">sign and they&amp;#39;re gonna review it and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="612.9" dur="5.52">sure what&amp;#39;s in there is going to pretty</text>
  <text start="614.85" dur="7.32">darn damaging and I believe all the</text>
  <text start="618.42" dur="5.85">players are all set this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="622.17" dur="4.74">been cleaning house and taking the time</text>
  <text start="624.27" dur="6.75">because how do you prosecute some</text>
  <text start="626.91" dur="6.57">someone or a group of people if everyone</text>
  <text start="631.02" dur="5.46">in the department is in on it it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="633.48" dur="7.08">be done you need to clean it out first</text>
  <text start="636.48" dur="7.14">so the plan is moving forward you need</text>
  <text start="640.56" dur="5.63">to take these steps first before you can</text>
  <text start="643.62" dur="5.43">actually unseal the indictments and</text>
  <text start="646.19" dur="4.42">start the prosecution you need evidence</text>
  <text start="649.05" dur="3.96">you need a clean house</text>
  <text start="650.61" dur="6.66">you need fresh people in there to</text>
  <text start="653.01" dur="6.66">actually do the job now we see the</text>
  <text start="657.27" dur="4.2">Senate they&amp;#39;re voting to restore net</text>
  <text start="659.67" dur="4.23">neutrality it looks like the US Senate</text>
  <text start="661.47" dur="4.23">voted to keep the 2015 net neutrality</text>
  <text start="663.9" dur="4.5">then it goes to the house and if the</text>
  <text start="665.7" dur="4.97">house votes for it well then it goes to</text>
  <text start="668.4" dur="5.04">Trump most likely he&amp;#39;s going to veto it</text>
  <text start="670.67" dur="4.9">the deep state they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="673.44" dur="5.13">whatever they possibly can to get back</text>
  <text start="675.57" dur="5.43">what Trump is getting rid of and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="678.57" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re continually trying now with</text>
  <text start="681" dur="6.3">North Korea the corporate media they are</text>
  <text start="683.97" dur="5.55">really pushing there the agenda for the</text>
  <text start="687.3" dur="3.539">deep state and we&amp;#39;ve been hearing from</text>
  <text start="689.52" dur="3.15">the corporate media that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="690.839" dur="5.341">threatening to cancel the summit it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="698.85" dur="4.53">York Times and everyone is just</text>
  <text start="701.19" dur="4.5">continually repeating the same exact</text>
  <text start="703.38" dur="5.4">thing over and over and over now</text>
  <text start="705.69" dur="6.24">the North Koreans they did make a</text>
  <text start="708.78" dur="5.91">statement and we have the statement that</text>
  <text start="711.93" dur="5.81">they made and what they did was they</text>
  <text start="714.69" dur="6.18">took a piece of it and they went with it</text>
  <text start="717.74" dur="6.07">so basically the you</text>
  <text start="720.87" dur="5.46">deparment has informed everyone that the</text>
  <text start="723.81" dur="5.58">talks the summit is on they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="726.33" dur="6.36">preparations North Korea never notify</text>

  <text start="732.69" dur="5.01">president is going to Singapore where</text>
  <text start="735.24" dur="4.38">the meetings going to take place so if</text>

  <text start="742.65" dur="6.36">corporate media says about it as the</text>
  <text start="745.77" dur="5.31">truth one thing is clear North Korea</text>
  <text start="749.01" dur="4.38">isn&amp;#39;t making any unilateral concessions</text>

  <text start="1124.1" dur="4.41">was a staged whatever what was going on</text>
  <text start="1126.23" dur="4.47">at that time but it&amp;#39;s not an up-to-date</text>
  <text start="1128.51" dur="4.95">video but it looks like a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1130.7" dur="6.42">are using this to say hey look</text>
  <text start="1133.46" dur="5.76">Hamas is behind all of this Hamas is</text>
  <text start="1137.12" dur="4.38">faking the deaths and this whole video</text>
  <text start="1139.22" dur="4.5">has been completely debunked now the</text>
  <text start="1141.5" dur="4.5">Israeli military says their rocket</text>
  <text start="1143.72" dur="4.85">warning were sounded on the</text>

  <text start="1148.57" dur="5.77">they&amp;#39;re saying that it went off rockets</text>
  <text start="1151.76" dur="5.49">were incoming but they come to find out</text>
  <text start="1154.34" dur="5.16">that there were no rockets that were</text>
  <text start="1157.25" dur="6.24">headed towards them that this was a</text>
  <text start="1159.5" dur="7.77">false alarm and they&amp;#39;re looking into why</text>
  <text start="1163.49" dur="5.4">this happened and most likely maybe they</text>
  <text start="1167.27" dur="3.36">were supposed to be Rockets coming in</text>
  <text start="1168.89" dur="3.72">and they were getting prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="1170.63" dur="4.32">for it because most of the time we see</text>
  <text start="1172.61" dur="5.73">this we see these things as false Flags</text>
  <text start="1174.95" dur="7.08">where Rockets are shot off they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1178.34" dur="7.59">hit anything and Israel says they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1182.03" dur="6.75">being attacked and this is the same</text>
  <text start="1185.93" dur="4.8">false flag they continually use over and</text>
  <text start="1188.78" dur="4.08">over and over and maybe this time it</text>
  <text start="1190.73" dur="4.29">didn&amp;#39;t go as planned they set off the</text>
  <text start="1192.86" dur="6.42">alarms and there was nothing at this</text>
  <text start="1195.02" dur="6.45">time now we also see that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1199.28" dur="6.45">army they&amp;#39;ve discovered hidden weapons</text>
  <text start="1201.47" dur="7.29">in caves they found tanks they found</text>
  <text start="1205.73" dur="5.97">explosives they found ammunition they</text>
  <text start="1208.76" dur="6.39">found medical supplies and a lot of this</text>
  <text start="1211.7" dur="6.27">is from Israel a lot of it from us and</text>
  <text start="1215.15" dur="6.36">we can see that all this information is</text>
  <text start="1217.97" dur="5.28">now coming out that they were behind the</text>
  <text start="1221.51" dur="5.97">terrorist groups the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="1223.25" dur="7.17">the deep state and as they find more and</text>
  <text start="1227.48" dur="5.58">more of all of this they&amp;#39;re finding out</text>
  <text start="1230.42" dur="4.32">which we already do and I think many of</text>
  <text start="1233.06" dur="4.62">the countries already knew that they</text>
  <text start="1234.74" dur="6.3">were behind all of this this was the</text>

  <text start="1254.18" dur="3.48">there won&amp;#39;t be any propaganda coming</text>
  <text start="1255.65" dur="4.34">the Islamic state anymore the Islamic</text>

  <text start="1263.36" dur="4.949">nothing left and it&amp;#39;s going nowhere and</text>
  <text start="1266.75" dur="5.309">I think with everything else going on</text>
  <text start="1268.309" dur="6.511">with Mueller&amp;#39;s case going nowhere with</text>
  <text start="1272.059" dur="3.481">Horowitz&amp;#39;s report coming out very very</text>
  <text start="1274.82" dur="2.73">soon</text>
  <text start="1275.54" dur="5.46">I think the deep states going to be</text>
  <text start="1277.55" dur="4.74">scrambling here and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1281" dur="4.23">surprised if there are some type of</text>

  <text start="1285.23" dur="5.76">stuff&amp;#39;s going to hit and I think this</text>
  <text start="1287.75" dur="5.7">might be the Mayflower&amp;#39;s that cue has</text>
  <text start="1290.99" dur="4.71">been talking about we see the OPCW</text>
  <text start="1293.45" dur="5.67">report on the chemical attack this was</text>
  <text start="1295.7" dur="5.82">the report on the February 4th attack</text>
  <text start="1299.12" dur="4.41">and this is where the OPCW didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="1301.52" dur="4.53">into Syria they didn&amp;#39;t have anyone on</text>
  <text start="1303.53" dur="5.97">the ground they relied on social media</text>
  <text start="1306.05" dur="5.7">they relied on other people giving them</text>
  <text start="1309.5" dur="4.5">information and they come to the</text>
  <text start="1311.75" dur="5.52">conclusion that yes chlorine was used</text>
  <text start="1314" dur="5.58">and we don&amp;#39;t know who used it and we</text>
  <text start="1317.27" dur="4.74">came to this conclusion because people</text>
  <text start="1319.58" dur="4.95">told us that chlorine was used and they</text>
  <text start="1322.01" dur="5.85">showed us empty canisters but again</text>
  <text start="1324.53" dur="6.75">nobody was on the ground nobody was</text>
  <text start="1327.86" dur="6.87">there because the attack took place in</text>
  <text start="1331.28" dur="7.92">the terrorists area so they couldn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="1334.73" dur="6.81">into the area so once again this report</text>
  <text start="1339.2" dur="4.49">is ridiculous Russia&amp;#39;s out there saying</text>
  <text start="1341.54" dur="6.12">we don&amp;#39;t even understand this report</text>
  <text start="1343.69" dur="5.35">because they didn&amp;#39;t even visit Syria how</text>
  <text start="1347.66" dur="2.85">are they couldn&amp;#39;t how are they coming to</text>
  <text start="1349.04" dur="4.74">this conclusion imagine if you were on</text>
  <text start="1350.51" dur="6.12">trial for a robbery or murder or</text>
  <text start="1353.78" dur="4.59">anything and all they did was listen to</text>
  <text start="1356.63" dur="3.51">other people and get their information</text>
  <text start="1358.37" dur="4.14">for social media there was no</text>

  <text start="1362.51" dur="5.64">that information to convict you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1365.45" dur="4.56">absolutely ridiculous because you don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1378.86" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t even understand this but once</text>
  <text start="1380.45" dur="5.07">again the OPCW what they do is they</text>
  <text start="1383.27" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t pin it on anyone and they just say</text>
  <text start="1385.52" dur="3.82">yeah it was used but we don&amp;#39;t know who</text>
