  <text start="125.75" dur="6.53">on the people you build software to</text>
  <text start="128.119" dur="7.49">allow this what about the Constitution</text>
  <text start="132.28" dur="8.88">what about the rights of the individuals</text>
  <text start="135.609" dur="7.931">you violated the people the government</text>
  <text start="141.16" dur="6.22">doesn&amp;#39;t have the right to do this</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="7.35">without a warrant and of course they</text>
  <text start="147.38" dur="6">didn&amp;#39;t have one so the propaganda the US</text>
  <text start="150.89" dur="5.43">government central bankers used was that</text>
  <text start="153.38" dur="6.21">Russia hacked 500 million yahoo accounts</text>

  <text start="159.59" dur="3.76">terrible and of course it&amp;#39;s propaganda</text>
  <text start="161.35" dur="5.96">but Yahoo</text>
  <text start="163.35" dur="6.09">and the US government hacked all user</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="5.58">accounts and nobody has a problem with</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="5.94">that well everyone should have a problem</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="7.11">with that the government is continually</text>
  <text start="175.38" dur="6.77">spying on the people and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="180" dur="5.1">more and more documentation come out</text>
  <text start="182.15" dur="6.22">more and more information come out that</text>
  <text start="185.1" dur="5.42">they&amp;#39;re spying on everyone we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="5.36">that the Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="190.52" dur="8.64">through the Freedom of Information Act</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="9.58">that they were spying on and tracking</text>
  <text start="199.16" dur="7.87">American citizens who visited gun shows</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="8.67">across the country well how did they do</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="8.58">this they set up license plate tracking</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="7.98">systems they recorded the license plates</text>
  <text start="215.61" dur="7.11">at the gun shows and they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="219.96" dur="6.6">track to correlate and track them</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="8.24">wherever they go and we can see right</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="7.71">now what they&amp;#39;re doing is a violation of</text>
  <text start="230.96" dur="6.46">your rights they&amp;#39;re spying on everyone</text>
  <text start="234.27" dur="7.11">because we know the government is very</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="7.59">worried about those individuals that</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="6.75">have weapons and they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="245.01" dur="7.26">they possibly can to map out who has the</text>
  <text start="248.13" dur="6.9">weapons now they&amp;#39;re spying on</text>
  <text start="252.27" dur="5.55">law-abiding citizens they haven&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="5.34">anything they went to a gun show they</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="4.5">wanted to purchase a weapon maybe to</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="4.65">hang up in their home to use for</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="5.01">self-defense but that doesn&amp;#39;t give the</text>
  <text start="265.02" dur="5.28">government the right to spy and track</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="5.49">these individuals actually it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="6.95">violation of the 1986 firearm owners</text>
  <text start="272.82" dur="4.43">Protection Act and the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="277.88" dur="7.77">so we can see right now the government</text>
  <text start="280.17" dur="8.82">is spying on everyone in all aspects</text>
  <text start="285.65" dur="6.07">this is the biggest threat to the</text>
  <text start="288.99" dur="5.3">government the people when the people</text>
  <text start="291.72" dur="5.37">decide listen this government is corrupt</text>
  <text start="294.29" dur="5.68">not working for the people</text>
  <text start="297.09" dur="4.68">and the people say you know something we</text>
  <text start="299.97" dur="5.84">need to clean out the government and</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="6.81">start over this is their biggest worry</text>
  <text start="305.81" dur="5.95">because they have a nice little thing</text>
  <text start="308.58" dur="5.339">going up in the government limousines</text>
  <text start="311.76" dur="5.37">bringing them around insider information</text>
  <text start="313.919" dur="7.591">deals with corporations free money from</text>
  <text start="317.13" dur="7.71">the central bank they have one set of</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="5.67">laws we have another set of laws I mean</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="6.56">if you go back in time it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="327.18" dur="8.16">look like Washington is the kingdom and</text>
  <text start="331.4" dur="6.579">we&amp;#39;re the peasants this is what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="4.17">turned into and it wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to be</text>
  <text start="337.979" dur="3.511">this way it was supposed to be these</text>
  <text start="339.51" dur="4.44">individuals were supposed to be working</text>
  <text start="341.49" dur="5.25">for we the people but they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="343.95" dur="6.719">for we the corporations we the foreign</text>
  <text start="346.74" dur="6.87">governments their self-interests for</text>
  <text start="350.669" dur="6.361">profit for the central bank&amp;#39;s everyone</text>
  <text start="353.61" dur="6.089">but the people and now we see the US</text>
  <text start="357.03" dur="4.32">government is pushing climate change</text>
  <text start="359.699" dur="4.621">which used to be called global warming</text>
  <text start="361.35" dur="5.1">but when winters got so cold how do we</text>
  <text start="364.32" dur="3.81">explain away that things are warming up</text>
  <text start="366.45" dur="3.57">anymore so they called it climate change</text>
  <text start="368.13" dur="5.969">and we know the climate always changes</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="7.98">the Sun isn&amp;#39;t controls most of the</text>
  <text start="374.099" dur="7.561">climate here on earth and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378" dur="6.63">starting to use climate change and of</text>
  <text start="381.66" dur="6.84">course remember Obama bypass Congress to</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="5.4">push the climate agenda forward but</text>
  <text start="388.5" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re coming out with a lot of</text>
  <text start="390.03" dur="6.509">information and they&amp;#39;re warning</text>
  <text start="393" dur="6.12">governments that this global warming</text>
  <text start="396.539" dur="6.361">this climate change is going to have an</text>
  <text start="399.12" dur="6.87">effect on the world and on the people</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="7.199">and what they&amp;#39;re saying and this is</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="6.929">coming from a 13-page report from the</text>
  <text start="410.099" dur="5.421">nation&amp;#39;s intelligence agency who just</text>
  <text start="412.919" dur="6.691">adopted this whole global warming</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="8.04">climate change thing and there&amp;#39;s stating</text>
  <text start="419.61" dur="8.67">that that climate change can fuel</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="7.53">terrorism really so the United States</text>
  <text start="428.28" dur="6.99">government central bankers paying</text>

  <text start="443.55" dur="6.929">creating the Islamic state to spread out</text>
  <text start="447.24" dur="4.979">throughout the Middle East that had to</text>
  <text start="450.479" dur="2.701">do with global warming climbing trees</text>
  <text start="452.219" dur="3.931">know that had to do with the US</text>
