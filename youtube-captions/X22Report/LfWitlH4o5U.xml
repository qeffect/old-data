  <text start="86.47" dur="6.03">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="88.96" dur="6.6">as we know the central bank controlled</text>
  <text start="92.5" dur="5.009">world it is coming to an end and we need</text>
  <text start="95.56" dur="3.93">to remember that there are good guys and</text>
  <text start="97.509" dur="4.561">bad guys in the central bank just like</text>
  <text start="99.49" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;s good guys and bad guys in the</text>
  <text start="102.07" dur="5.85">government right now the deep state they</text>
  <text start="105.07" dur="6.089">still have operatives still working in</text>
  <text start="107.92" dur="5.4">these areas and this is why we see</text>
  <text start="111.159" dur="5.161">everything happening at once and even</text>
  <text start="113.32" dur="5.579">know Powell was put into place into the</text>
  <text start="116.32" dur="4.979">Fed chair position by Trump there are</text>
  <text start="118.899" dur="4.981">still others within the Fed that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="121.299" dur="4.831">agree with what he&amp;#39;s doing they want a</text>
  <text start="123.88" dur="3.9">different outcome especially when you</text>
  <text start="126.13" dur="4.44">move up and you move up to the</text>
  <text start="127.78" dur="5.19">Rothschilds they definitely want a</text>
  <text start="130.57" dur="6.57">different outcome because their plan</text>
  <text start="132.97" dur="7.29">their entire plan was to move the system</text>
  <text start="137.14" dur="6.03">someplace else with a huge event and</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="5.58">started all over and they were hoping</text>
  <text start="143.17" dur="5.7">that the United States would lose in</text>
  <text start="145.84" dur="4.41">this event which would be a war and they</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="2.55">would be able to have this one-world</text>
  <text start="150.25" dur="4.23">government that&amp;#39;s what they were</text>
  <text start="151.42" dur="4.35">planning for now we know the central</text>
  <text start="154.48" dur="3.66">bank system is coming to an end because</text>
  <text start="155.77" dur="4.83">it doesn&amp;#39;t last that long throughout</text>
  <text start="158.14" dur="4.62">history the central bank system was only</text>
  <text start="160.6" dur="4.87">designed to last 40 to 45 years and that</text>
  <text start="162.76" dur="4.42">is it yes they can continually print</text>
  <text start="165.47" dur="3.18">they can continually create the currency</text>
  <text start="167.18" dur="3.96">but eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="168.65" dur="3.72">the system breaks down and you really</text>
  <text start="171.14" dur="2.94">can&amp;#39;t do anything to stop it</text>
  <text start="172.37" dur="3.87">it gets worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="174.08" dur="4.77">and the beginning everyone feels great</text>
  <text start="176.24" dur="4.8">because there&amp;#39;s inflation there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="178.85" dur="4.44">that much debt all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="181.04" dur="4.32">home prices wages they just boom they</text>
  <text start="183.29" dur="3.42">shoot up and then eventually what</text>
  <text start="185.36" dur="3.12">happens it starts to slow a little bit</text>
  <text start="186.71" dur="5.07">slow a bit and then when you come to the</text>
  <text start="188.48" dur="5.37">end phase everything turns around so</text>
  <text start="191.78" dur="5.43">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is increased</text>
  <text start="193.85" dur="6.45">financial instability and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="197.21" dur="5.64">to see that this creation of currency it</text>
  <text start="200.3" dur="5.73">is all coming to an end now remember the</text>
  <text start="202.85" dur="4.859">idea that it&amp;#39;s impossible for a</text>
  <text start="206.03" dur="3.81">government to go bust is absolutely</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="3.661">ridiculous I mean the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="209.84" dur="3.72">the central banks they want you to</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="4.5">believe this where they say like all we</text>
  <text start="213.56" dur="5.37">have to do is create more currency no</text>
  <text start="215.87" dur="5.31">problems we can never go bust well look</text>
  <text start="218.93" dur="5.76">at countries from the past look at</text>
  <text start="221.18" dur="6.12">Argentina look at Germany look at</text>
  <text start="224.69" dur="4.17">Zimbabwe look at all of these countries</text>
  <text start="227.3" dur="4.26">I know if you go further back in time</text>
  <text start="228.86" dur="5.72">you&amp;#39;ll find some more they&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="231.56" dur="6.42">gone bust and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a</text>
  <text start="234.58" dur="5.56">complete and utter destruction of the</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="4.56">entire system and what central banks</text>
  <text start="240.14" dur="4.71">like to do is when the whole system</text>
  <text start="242.54" dur="5.16">starts to fall apart they like to go</text>
  <text start="244.85" dur="5.28">from one fiat system to another now I</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="4.74">know people call it Phi at Fiat I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="250.13" dur="4.109">gonna use Fiat right now because a lot</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="3.63">of people agree with Fiat and a lot of</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="3.78">people don&amp;#39;t agree with Fayette but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="256.07" dur="6.12">saying that you can pronounce it both</text>
  <text start="258.019" dur="7.231">ways so right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="262.19" dur="5.91">that the central bank wanted us to move</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="7.35">from one fiat system to another that is</text>
  <text start="268.1" dur="7.86">always their plan the new plan is not</text>
  <text start="272.6" dur="6.15">that the new plan is to have a people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.96" dur="4.29">system where the people create their own</text>
  <text start="278.75" dur="4.5">currency maybe you&amp;#39;ll be backed by gold</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="5.46">maybe gold will be in the background to</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="5.25">give confidence to people now Alistair</text>
  <text start="285.71" dur="5.13">McCloud he wrote this great article and</text>
  <text start="288.5" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s titled the end of the nanny state</text>
  <text start="290.84" dur="4.98">and what happens to prices when gold is</text>
  <text start="292.76" dur="6.21">money let me just read a portion of this</text>
  <text start="295.82" dur="3.92">to get an idea of how things are going</text>
  <text start="298.97" dur="3.93">to change</text>
  <text start="299.74" dur="5.77">when gold is money and bank credit is</text>
  <text start="302.9" dur="4.98">eliminated trade imbalances cannot arise</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="4.89">this is to say cross-border purchases</text>
  <text start="307.88" dur="4.77">cannot be financed by credit other</text>
  <text start="310.4" dur="4.23">perhaps than self-extinguishing trade</text>
  <text start="312.65" dur="4.71">finance specifically for the purpose of</text>
  <text start="314.63" dur="4.92">trade settlement imports including oil</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="5.4">and other commodities have to be paid</text>
  <text start="319.55" dur="5.58">for an aggregated basis by exports it is</text>
  <text start="322.76" dur="4.65">for this reason that trade imbalances</text>
  <text start="325.13" dur="5.64">cannot occur between nations settling</text>
  <text start="327.41" dur="5.55">their trade with sound money the</text>
  <text start="330.77" dur="4.4">implication is that most commodity</text>
  <text start="332.96" dur="5.16">speculation in fiat money economies is</text>
  <text start="335.17" dur="4.93">eliminated with gold because speculation</text>
  <text start="338.12" dur="4.11">whether it be backed by lines of credit</text>
  <text start="340.1" dur="4.08">or in futures which ultimately are</text>
  <text start="342.23" dur="4.8">backed by credit becomes severely</text>
  <text start="344.18" dur="5.01">restricted speculation cannot be</text>
  <text start="347.03" dur="3.54">eliminated entirely because there is</text>
  <text start="349.19" dur="3.3">nothing to stop two parties from</text>
  <text start="350.57" dur="3.84">entering into a wager without the</text>
  <text start="352.49" dur="4.47">services of a credit issuing banker</text>
  <text start="354.41" dur="5.13">therefore destabilizing price trends are</text>
  <text start="356.96" dur="4.92">less likely to be set in motion the</text>
  <text start="359.54" dur="4.74">demand for risk management through the</text>
  <text start="361.88" dur="5.16">use of derivatives is likely to recede</text>
  <text start="364.28" dur="4.83">as well due to the absence of volatility</text>
  <text start="367.04" dur="4.14">of the currency side of prices an</text>
  <text start="369.11" dur="4.95">absence of central bank intervention</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="6.15">which ceases with sound money ends the</text>
  <text start="374.06" dur="5.58">destabilizing credit cycle it is this</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="4.65">that dries fluctuations in the</text>
  <text start="379.64" dur="4.38">purchasing power of currencies both by</text>
  <text start="381.98" dur="4.53">increasing the quality of money and</text>
  <text start="384.02" dur="4.77">credit and by destabilizing our monetary</text>
  <text start="386.51" dur="4.62">preferences the price volatility we</text>
  <text start="388.79" dur="5.06">experienced today is almost entirely due</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="6.86">to excessive quantities of dollars</text>
  <text start="393.85" dur="6.91">sloshing around in the global system</text>
  <text start="397.99" dur="4.69">eliminate that and you eliminate the</text>
  <text start="400.76" dur="5.91">single most important source of price</text>
  <text start="402.68" dur="5.46">volatility and everything that we see</text>
  <text start="406.67" dur="4.64">today and we have to remember we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="408.14" dur="5.88">brainwashed to think this is normal</text>
  <text start="411.31" dur="5.5">Ashley if you go back to 1913 prior to</text>
  <text start="414.02" dur="5.01">the 1913 they talked about central</text>
  <text start="416.81" dur="5.01">bank&amp;#39;s they talked about having a sound</text>
  <text start="419.03" dur="3.63">money system and then after 1913 the</text>
  <text start="421.82" dur="3.6">central bank</text>
  <text start="422.66" dur="6.38">well they got rid of all of this and as</text>
  <text start="425.42" dur="6.12">time went on they removed a lot more and</text>
  <text start="429.04" dur="3.56">this is what they do to brainwash the</text>
  <text start="431.54" dur="4.06">public into</text>
  <text start="432.6" dur="7.55">looking at the central bank but we know</text>
  <text start="435.6" dur="8.52">the central bank this is the entire</text>
  <text start="440.15" dur="7.54">problem of our system because out of</text>
  <text start="444.12" dur="5.67">this comes corruption comes borrowing</text>
  <text start="447.69" dur="7.89">comes funneling of money to different</text>
  <text start="449.79" dur="6.9">areas comes payoffs and to stop a lot of</text>
  <text start="455.58" dur="4.38">this I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s all gonna go</text>
  <text start="456.69" dur="5.67">away but to stop a lot of this you got</text>
  <text start="459.96" dur="5.03">to go to the source just like if you</text>
  <text start="462.36" dur="5.79">think about the Islamic state in Syria</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="4.96">where they said you know this group was</text>
  <text start="468.15" dur="4.53">impossible to stop it&amp;#39;s gonna go on for</text>
  <text start="469.95" dur="5.87">six years well all you had to do is stop</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="6.69">the money supply and that was the oil</text>
  <text start="475.82" dur="5.98">shipping to Turkey where they filled up</text>
  <text start="479.37" dur="4.62">on oil put him on trucks drove them into</text>
  <text start="481.8" dur="4.89">Turkey and this kept the whole entire</text>
  <text start="483.99" dur="3.27">system going Russia came along shut it</text>
  <text start="486.69" dur="4.26">all down</text>
  <text start="487.26" dur="5.67">guess what revenue fell to zero what</text>
  <text start="490.95" dur="4.38">happened to the Islamic state they no</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="3.87">longer exist today maybe in small</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="3.69">pockets but they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="496.8" dur="5.76">operation do the same thing with the</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="8.16">deep state go to the source of where</text>
  <text start="502.56" dur="9.53">they get their currency stop it guess</text>
  <text start="507.18" dur="9.299">what happens you cut off everything now</text>
  <text start="512.09" dur="6.97">the central bank players they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="516.479" dur="3.99">going to want to give this up the deep</text>
  <text start="519.06" dur="3.539">state they&amp;#39;re not going to want to give</text>
  <text start="520.469" dur="5.641">this up they&amp;#39;re gonna continually fight</text>
  <text start="522.599" dur="5.191">until the very end and you can see what</text>
  <text start="526.11" dur="3.48">the Federal Reserve there are good guys</text>
  <text start="527.79" dur="4.65">and bad guys within this organization</text>
  <text start="529.59" dur="5.16">now we need to remember the ultimate</text>
  <text start="532.44" dur="3.36">goal is to go after the central bank</text>
  <text start="534.75" dur="3.3">this is why again</text>
  <text start="535.8" dur="5.61">Trump has Andrew Jackson hanging in his</text>
  <text start="538.05" dur="5.19">on his wall in his office and there</text>
  <text start="541.41" dur="3.99">right now he&amp;#39;s working with Powell to</text>
  <text start="543.24" dur="5.31">push this entire system to the very edge</text>
  <text start="545.4" dur="4.65">while keeping the illusion of life that</text>
  <text start="548.55" dur="3.72">the economy is doing well this way it</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="5.25">cannot be blamed on him remember it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="552.27" dur="5.64">about optics but right now the Federal</text>
  <text start="555.3" dur="4.83">Reserve they&amp;#39;re gonna be publishing a</text>
  <text start="557.91" dur="4.02">semi-annual report on financial</text>
  <text start="560.13" dur="5.19">stability the report the first of which</text>
  <text start="561.93" dur="4.18">will come on November 28th it will</text>
  <text start="565.32" dur="1.9">include</text>
  <text start="566.11" dur="2.729">a summary of the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="4.32">framework for assessing the resilience</text>
  <text start="568.839" dur="4.891">of the US financial system now I do</text>
  <text start="571.54" dur="5.609">believe they&amp;#39;re gonna use this to</text>
  <text start="573.73" dur="5.849">explain their part of the narrative and</text>
  <text start="577.149" dur="4.921">they&amp;#39;re going to try to counter what is</text>
  <text start="579.579" dur="4.231">going on here because they&amp;#39;re gonna put</text>
  <text start="582.07" dur="4.259">out that everything is great their</text>
  <text start="583.81" dur="4.38">policy is working and everything is</text>
  <text start="586.329" dur="4.681">fantastic just like the stress test</text>
  <text start="588.19" dur="4.88">remember what they&amp;#39;re doing here is</text>
  <text start="591.01" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re setting up an illusion</text>
  <text start="593.07" dur="6.43">showing everyone how great they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="596.14" dur="6">and by showing the stress test of banks</text>
  <text start="599.5" dur="5.67">that they could say wasn&amp;#39;t us we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="602.14" dur="4.77">showing them all strong this look we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.17" dur="3.75">putting out a report we&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="606.91" dur="4.23">everything we&amp;#39;re doing is fantastic</text>
  <text start="608.92" dur="3.96">Trump has already pointed to the Federal</text>
  <text start="611.14" dur="4.23">Reserve saying that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="612.88" dur="5.07">responsible one for when the economy</text>
  <text start="615.37" dur="5.969">comes down so again both sides they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="617.95" dur="5.629">both going to battle and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="621.339" dur="6.451">to keep the narrative but right now</text>
  <text start="623.579" dur="6.25">Trump his team the Patriots they do have</text>
  <text start="627.79" dur="3.33">the narrative there&amp;#39;s nothing the</text>
  <text start="629.829" dur="3.12">central bank can do at this point</text>
  <text start="631.12" dur="4.44">because the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="632.949" dur="5.191">fantastically as Trump continually comes</text>
  <text start="635.56" dur="5.79">out and tells the world that the central</text>
  <text start="638.14" dur="5.58">bank as they raise rates that just that</text>
  <text start="641.35" dur="5.4">little portion of him just saying that</text>
  <text start="643.72" dur="6.39">people are gonna start to let it seep in</text>
  <text start="646.75" dur="7.11">that ya rates are rising the housing</text>
