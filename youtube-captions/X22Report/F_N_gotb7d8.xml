  <text start="68.49" dur="5.64">credit crisis let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="3.66">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="74.13" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on all the</text>
  <text start="75.51" dur="4.38">different indicators that have been</text>
  <text start="77.73" dur="5.01">showing us that the economy is breaking</text>
  <text start="79.89" dur="4.49">down and we are continually getting more</text>
  <text start="82.74" dur="4.59">and more indicators showing us that</text>
  <text start="84.38" dur="5.32">everything is about to change now we</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="4.74">talked about new home sales and we can</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="4.83">see that they have declined we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="92.07" dur="5.73">seeing existing home sales they tumbled</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="6.69">by 2.5 percent now remember we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="97.8" dur="7.14">into the spring summer months this is</text>
  <text start="101.22" dur="5.46">normally the best time for housing now</text>
  <text start="104.94" dur="4.44">of course we know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="106.68" dur="4.98">interest rates are moving up refi</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="5.4">applications are declining mortgage apps</text>
  <text start="111.66" dur="6.12">are declining and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="114.78" dur="6.3">it&amp;#39;s taken its toll we saw the same</text>
  <text start="117.78" dur="7.35">thing happened back in two thousand five</text>
  <text start="121.08" dur="5.79">six seven when the Fed was raising their</text>
  <text start="125.13" dur="3.81">rates they did it very very slowly so no</text>
  <text start="126.87" dur="3.869">one really realized what was going on</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="2.82">and what was going to happen because the</text>
  <text start="130.739" dur="2.461">corporate media was telling us that</text>
  <text start="131.76" dur="3.78">everything was great the Fed was telling</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="5.069">us everything was great but we can see</text>
  <text start="135.54" dur="6.81">that things are rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="138.269" dur="7.231">now purchases fell in three of the four</text>
  <text start="142.35" dur="5.669">regions including 2.9 percent decline in</text>
  <text start="145.5" dur="6.39">the South three point three percent drop</text>
  <text start="148.019" dur="6.871">in the West and we can see that from all</text>
  <text start="151.89" dur="4.89">of this things are rapidly changing now</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="4.379">the Fed did come out with their minutes</text>
  <text start="156.78" dur="5.55">and they were saying well instead of</text>
  <text start="159.269" dur="5.581">three to four rate increases maybe we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="162.33" dur="5.43">have one more right now because they can</text>
  <text start="164.85" dur="5.07">see the toll that it is taking on the</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="3.99">economy now of course the central bank</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="3.81">doesn&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for bringing</text>
  <text start="171.75" dur="3.989">it down by raising their rates so</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re gonna slow the process down to</text>
  <text start="175.739" dur="5.101">make it seem like well it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="177.69" dur="7.17">us this is what they did in 2006 going</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="6.02">into 2007 they increase the rates and</text>
  <text start="184.86" dur="4.25">then as things</text>
  <text start="186.86" dur="4.23">started to break down they started to</text>
  <text start="189.11" dur="3.81">lower them now they didn&amp;#39;t slowly lower</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="5.37">them the rates came down like an</text>
  <text start="192.92" dur="5.91">elevator with you know no brakes or</text>
  <text start="196.46" dur="4.32">anything they just dropped the same</text>
  <text start="198.83" dur="3.39">thing is gonna happen once again and we</text>
  <text start="200.78" dur="3.17">might even move into negative territory</text>
  <text start="202.22" dur="4.89">once things start to really fall apart</text>
  <text start="203.95" dur="5.17">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="207.11" dur="3.93">lawrence yun from the National</text>
  <text start="209.12" dur="4.02">Association of Realtors is out there</text>
  <text start="211.04" dur="6.27">saying that we are seeing no breakout in</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="6.72">home sales and this is very strange</text>
  <text start="217.31" dur="6.75">because this isn&amp;#39;t a time when the</text>
  <text start="219.86" dur="7.83">economy is doing very well well the</text>
  <text start="224.06" dur="4.5">economy is not doing very well this is</text>
  <text start="227.69" dur="3.48">an illusion</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s funny how Fitch and all these</text>
  <text start="231.17" dur="4.59">rating agencies and all the financial</text>
  <text start="233.03" dur="5.04">pun ins and the National Association of</text>
  <text start="235.76" dur="4.62">Realtors they can&amp;#39;t understand what is</text>
  <text start="238.07" dur="5.04">going on here because in their heads the</text>
  <text start="240.38" dur="4.109">economy is doing well and they think</text>
  <text start="243.11" dur="4.17">everything is great and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="244.489" dur="5.22">explain why people aren&amp;#39;t shopping in</text>
  <text start="247.28" dur="5.67">retail why aren&amp;#39;t people purchasing</text>
  <text start="249.709" dur="5.761">homes everyone has a job so why are the</text>
  <text start="252.95" dur="5.52">delinquencies rising and it all doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="6.36">make any sense this is what happens when</text>
  <text start="258.47" dur="5.36">an illusion breaks down and again as</text>
  <text start="261.83" dur="5.25">interest rates continually move up</text>
  <text start="263.83" dur="6.339">things are going to break and that is</text>
  <text start="267.08" dur="4.74">what we are seeing right now now we can</text>
  <text start="270.169" dur="4.651">see that there&amp;#39;s been a lot of talk</text>
  <text start="271.82" dur="6.27">about trade with China especially with</text>
  <text start="274.82" dur="6.24">the ZTE phones and we talked about that</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="6.36">with Q in previous reports and it looks</text>
  <text start="281.06" dur="6.84">like Steve minuchin was in charge of</text>
  <text start="284.45" dur="6.99">going out and you know haggling with</text>
  <text start="287.9" dur="7.11">China and I think he was put into this</text>
  <text start="291.44" dur="6.42">position on purpose Trump is testing him</text>
  <text start="295.01" dur="4.38">wants to see what he does and it looks</text>
  <text start="297.86" dur="4.41">like that</text>
  <text start="299.39" dur="6.3">he&amp;#39;s going against what Trump really</text>
  <text start="302.27" dur="7.53">wants because we need to remember the</text>
  <text start="305.69" dur="7.74">ZTE phone according to Q is used for</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="5.869">other reasons and right now Trump is</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="4.71">saying listen we want a change in</text>
  <text start="315.669" dur="3.941">management there&amp;#39;s going to be heavy</text>
  <text start="318.14" dur="5.519">fines</text>
  <text start="319.61" dur="7.019">and minutiae is really on the other side</text>
  <text start="323.659" dur="5.07">right now trying to mend everything</text>
  <text start="326.629" dur="5.91">trying to say no everything is fine</text>
  <text start="328.729" dur="6.66">and it looks like minutia n-- eventually</text>
  <text start="332.539" dur="6">might be the next individual to go we</text>
  <text start="335.389" dur="5.52">saw it happen with many people within</text>
  <text start="338.539" dur="4.951">his administration and I think minuchin</text>
  <text start="340.909" dur="4.171">who&amp;#39;s a Goldman Sachs boy I think he was</text>
  <text start="343.49" dur="5.31">put into place because in the beginning</text>
  <text start="345.08" dur="7.049">phase of Trump coming into office this</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="5.579">was someone he had to accept and I think</text>
  <text start="352.129" dur="4.171">now as he&amp;#39;s taking more and more control</text>
  <text start="354.379" dur="3.991">he doesn&amp;#39;t have to accept these</text>
  <text start="356.3" dur="4.95">individuals anymore he can clean house</text>
  <text start="358.37" dur="5.18">and I think this is the next move the</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="5.46">same thing that&amp;#39;s gonna happen with</text>
  <text start="363.55" dur="6.16">nikki Haley it&amp;#39;s gonna happen with many</text>
  <text start="366.71" dur="4.62">others because these are all leftovers</text>
  <text start="369.71" dur="4.709">these are individuals that were put into</text>
  <text start="371.33" dur="6.57">place by the deep state those who were</text>
  <text start="374.419" dur="5.97">in control at the time and those</text>
  <text start="377.9" dur="4.53">Republicans and whatnot who said you</text>
  <text start="380.389" dur="3.99">need to take these individuals and you</text>
  <text start="382.43" dur="5.4">need to put them into the into your</text>
  <text start="384.379" dur="7.5">cabinet so we see right now that things</text>
  <text start="387.83" dur="5.639">are changing now the FDIC may came out</text>
  <text start="391.879" dur="3.421">with their quarterly report on</text>
  <text start="393.469" dur="5.01">commercial banks and saving institutions</text>
  <text start="395.3" dur="5.85">and they cited in the media mostly for</text>
  <text start="398.479" dur="4.021">the 56 billion in profits at the FDIC</text>
  <text start="401.15" dur="3.75">insured commercial banks and savings</text>
  <text start="402.5" dur="5.069">institutions made in the first quarter</text>
  <text start="404.9" dur="5.37">which was up 27 percent from a year ago</text>
  <text start="407.569" dur="5.641">an estimated 6.6 billion of the profits</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="6.989">were actually due to the tax law changes</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="6.299">and it remained mostly unmentioned that</text>
  <text start="417.259" dur="4.891">this increase in profits came after the</text>
  <text start="419.509" dur="5.19">huge charge off banks took in the fourth</text>
  <text start="422.15" dur="6.6">quarter mostly due to the write downs of</text>
  <text start="424.699" dur="6.75">tax assets also a result of the new tax</text>
  <text start="428.75" dur="4.319">law now they didn&amp;#39;t mention that at all</text>
  <text start="431.449" dur="3.96">now these writedowns</text>
  <text start="433.069" dur="5.22">slashed bank profits in the fourth</text>
  <text start="435.409" dur="4.591">quarter to 25 billion the worst quarter</text>
  <text start="438.289" dur="6.391">since the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="440" dur="7.919">now the FDIC said the following</text>
  <text start="444.68" dur="5.639">we had an undue disruption to the</text>
  <text start="447.919" dur="4.801">financial system during the last</text>
  <text start="450.319" dur="5.491">downturn and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="452.72" dur="5.97">another one so they said an undue</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="5.7">disruption well that&amp;#39;s when banks</text>
  <text start="458.69" dur="6.02">stopped lending that&amp;#39;s when credit</text>
  <text start="461.51" dur="5.28">freezes up in a credit dependent economy</text>
  <text start="464.71" dur="2.92">everything then comes to a halt</text>
  <text start="466.79" dur="3.93">paychecks</text>
  <text start="467.63" dur="5.85">start bouncing deliveries stop</text>
  <text start="470.72" dur="7.35">everything stops because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="473.48" dur="7.32">credit credit freezes and these warnings</text>
  <text start="478.07" dur="5.7">about the end of the credit cycle aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="480.8" dur="5.25">coming out of the blue because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="483.77" dur="4.44">seen in other data that default in</text>
  <text start="486.05" dur="5.55">subprime auto loans and subprime credit</text>
  <text start="488.21" dur="6.69">card loans are already surging these are</text>
  <text start="491.6" dur="6.15">early flags that the credit cycle has</text>
  <text start="494.9" dur="5.15">entered the next phase we also see that</text>
  <text start="497.75" dur="5.31">individuals aren&amp;#39;t taking out loans</text>
  <text start="500.05" dur="6.43">because we&amp;#39;ve seen and we reported on</text>
  <text start="503.06" dur="5.07">this that this is declining merging at</text>
  <text start="506.48" dur="4.68">mortgage applications are declining</text>
  <text start="508.13" dur="5.52">refinance applications are declining we</text>
  <text start="511.16" dur="6.179">see all of this happening at the same</text>
  <text start="513.65" dur="5.49">time which means we&amp;#39;re heading down the</text>
  <text start="517.339" dur="5.491">same exact path that happened back when</text>
  <text start="519.14" dur="8.55">yes right before the financial crisis of</text>
  <text start="522.83" dur="6.87">2008 and the FDIC is out there warning</text>
  <text start="527.69" dur="3.3">everyone we don&amp;#39;t want to have the same</text>
  <text start="529.7" dur="4.02">thing happen again</text>
  <text start="530.99" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re basically telegraphing that</text>
  <text start="533.72" dur="6.33">we&amp;#39;re headed towards a credit crisis</text>
  <text start="536.36" dur="6.15">once again now Russia they are</text>
  <text start="540.05" dur="4.5">continually purchasing gold they have</text>
  <text start="542.51" dur="4.47">added to their gold reserves they are</text>
  <text start="544.55" dur="5.91">surging above nineteen hundred tons they</text>
  <text start="546.98" dur="5.94">are they fifth largest in the world and</text>
  <text start="550.46" dur="5.91">we see right now that they keep on</text>
  <text start="552.92" dur="6.12">adding gold I mean through April 2018</text>
  <text start="556.37" dur="5.27">the Central Bank of Russia has added 2.3</text>
  <text start="559.04" dur="6.15">million ounces of or approximately 70</text>
  <text start="561.64" dur="7.57">1.54 tons of gold and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="565.19" dur="7.68">adding gold like crazy now why are they</text>
  <text start="569.21" dur="6.6">adding all of this gold well if it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="6.26">confidence booster because when the</text>
  <text start="575.81" dur="5.76">system breaks down and countries are</text>
  <text start="579.13" dur="4.09">scrambling and and also you have to</text>
  <text start="581.57" dur="3.17">remember the countries are repatriating</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="3.359">their gold there&amp;#39;s a reason for all this</text>
  <text start="584.74" dur="3.61">when countries are</text>
  <text start="586.579" dur="3.151">rambling when we&amp;#39;re in this credit</text>
  <text start="588.35" dur="4.789">crisis when we&amp;#39;re in this financial</text>
  <text start="589.73" dur="6.75">calamity what do they do they look for</text>
  <text start="593.139" dur="6.61">something that&amp;#39;s secure that&amp;#39;s they have</text>
  <text start="596.48" dur="8.659">confidence in and throughout time</text>
  <text start="599.749" dur="10.101">gold silver they are confidence boosters</text>
  <text start="605.139" dur="6.971">that&amp;#39;s why Russia and China have been</text>
  <text start="609.85" dur="4.419">purchasing as much as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="612.11" dur="5.339">now they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing at a time</text>
  <text start="614.269" dur="4.651">when gold is very inexpensive because</text>
  <text start="617.449" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s being manipulated and things like</text>
  <text start="618.92" dur="3.359">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re gonna back</text>
  <text start="620.629" dur="4.05">their currency no but they&amp;#39;re gonna say</text>
  <text start="622.279" dur="5.85">listen we can show you the gold we have</text>
  <text start="624.679" dur="6.481">it here it is you don&amp;#39;t have to worry if</text>
  <text start="628.129" dur="5.341">something happens we have it compared to</text>
  <text start="631.16" dur="2.94">the United States we don&amp;#39;t know if they</text>
  <text start="633.47" dur="1.829">have the gold</text>
  <text start="634.1" dur="4.139">there&amp;#39;s been no audit there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="635.299" dur="7.02">nothing so we have no clue if there is</text>
  <text start="638.239" dur="5.611">gold now if there isn&amp;#39;t gold the United</text>
  <text start="642.319" dur="3.63">States is gonna lose confidence in a</text>
  <text start="643.85" dur="4.289">split second other countries are gonna</text>
  <text start="645.949" dur="3.93">look at this and say okay they have 21</text>
  <text start="648.139" dur="3.151">trillion dollars of debt of course</text>
  <text start="649.879" dur="2.88">that&amp;#39;s being reported we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="651.29" dur="3.709">unfunded liabilities and things like</text>
  <text start="652.759" dur="4.89">that and they have no gold</text>
  <text start="654.999" dur="5.68">you think countries are going to react</text>
  <text start="657.649" dur="6.331">in a way where they say hey maybe we</text>
  <text start="660.679" dur="5.1">should start looking at other currencies</text>
  <text start="663.98" dur="4.439">maybe we should look and be looking at</text>
  <text start="665.779" dur="5.4">other countries to make deals this is</text>
  <text start="668.419" dur="4.86">what&amp;#39;s been happening and once this</text>
  <text start="671.179" dur="4.08">whole thing falls apart and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="673.279" dur="4.61">realised that the u.s. does not have</text>
  <text start="675.259" dur="5.971">gold or they have a little bit of gold</text>
  <text start="677.889" dur="7.901">it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="681.23" dur="6.419">disaster now Russia is saying they are</text>
  <text start="685.79" dur="5.19">ready to ditch the dollar now remember</text>
  <text start="687.649" dur="6.6">China and Russia they&amp;#39;ve been creating</text>
