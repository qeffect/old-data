  <text start="53.05" dur="5.31">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.83" dur="5.67">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.36" dur="7.2">episode 1343 b and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="62.5" dur="5.49">27th 2017 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="65.56" dur="5.49">is are the elite getting ready to go all</text>
  <text start="67.99" dur="5.73">out let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="71.05" dur="4.98">political and geopolitical news now</text>
  <text start="73.72" dur="4.05">things are not going very well for</text>
  <text start="76.03" dur="4.35">Debbie wasserman-schultz</text>
  <text start="77.77" dur="4.29">we discussed how destroyed computer</text>
  <text start="80.38" dur="4.83">equipment was recovered from a home of</text>
  <text start="82.06" dur="7.23">owned by Imran and his wife and the</text>
  <text start="85.21" dur="9.36">daily callers Luke rosy AK is out with</text>
  <text start="89.29" dur="7.35">another bombshell Imran a one wire 283</text>
  <text start="94.57" dur="4.77">thousand dollars to Pakistan before</text>
  <text start="96.64" dur="6.33">attempting to flee the country to join</text>
  <text start="99.34" dur="7.95">his wife and she left the country with</text>
  <text start="102.97" dur="6.78">12 thousand dollars cash and basically</text>
  <text start="107.29" dur="4.38">we can see that this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="2.85">completely falling apart now Debbie</text>
  <text start="111.67" dur="3.08">wasserman-schultz</text>
  <text start="112.6" dur="5.219">is now trying to distance herself</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="5.5">claiming that mr. a1 was a part-time</text>
  <text start="117.819" dur="6.3">employee who serviced had been</text>
  <text start="120.25" dur="7.14">terminated and we can see that he went</text>
  <text start="124.119" dur="5.911">from a full-time employee to a part-time</text>
  <text start="127.39" dur="5.25">employee and this part-time employee was</text>
  <text start="130.03" dur="5.429">making a hundred and sixty-five thousand</text>
  <text start="132.64" dur="4.92">dollars which is kind of ridiculous and</text>
  <text start="135.459" dur="6.061">we can see that this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="137.56" dur="6.06">starting to unravel right now and more</text>
  <text start="141.52" dur="4.62">and more information is coming out and</text>
  <text start="143.62" dur="4.44">we can see that once they start looking</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="3.12">through these smashed hard drives and</text>
  <text start="148.06" dur="3.96">maybe they can get whatever they can get</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="4.83">off of the drives we&amp;#39;re going to find</text>
  <text start="152.02" dur="4.65">out a lot of information and I think</text>
  <text start="154.09" dur="5.04">there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="4.98">are going to be investigated because of</text>
  <text start="159.13" dur="4.38">this and it&amp;#39;s going to lead into more</text>
  <text start="161.65" dur="3.78">people and it&amp;#39;s just going to continue</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="4.62">on so this whole thing is starting to</text>
  <text start="165.43" dur="5.73">unravel I mean we can see already within</text>
  <text start="168.13" dur="4.74">the Trump administration with scour</text>
  <text start="171.16" dur="4.35">Moochie that you know they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="172.87" dur="4.71">after all these leakers and this whole</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="3.21">Trump with sessions thing I know the</text>
  <text start="177.58" dur="2.31">corporate media is playing up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.72" dur="4.23">loving this this is all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="179.89" dur="6.6">reporting on this is to nudge sessions</text>
  <text start="182.95" dur="6.18">to start the investigation in to</text>
  <text start="186.49" dur="6.9">all of this into the leakers into the</text>
  <text start="189.13" dur="7.23">Clinton emails and basically take</text>
  <text start="193.39" dur="6.24">everything and blow it wide open because</text>
  <text start="196.36" dur="5.97">this is what has to be done right now we</text>
  <text start="199.63" dur="5.73">have to expose the corruption and I</text>
  <text start="202.33" dur="5.55">think this is part of the plan and now</text>
  <text start="205.36" dur="4.98">is the time to start doing this and you</text>
  <text start="207.88" dur="4.74">can see that everything&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="5.76">come apart for the elite the deep state</text>
  <text start="212.62" dur="7.5">they&amp;#39;re very worried about this now out</text>
  <text start="216.1" dur="8.4">in the EU we can see that Poland Hungary</text>
  <text start="220.12" dur="8.34">the Czech Republic well they&amp;#39;re refusing</text>
  <text start="224.5" dur="7.17">to accept refugees and the EU is now</text>
  <text start="228.46" dur="5.84">forcing these countries and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="231.67" dur="5.88">saying listen you better accept these</text>
  <text start="234.3" dur="5.89">refugees it&amp;#39;s your legal obligation to</text>
  <text start="237.55" dur="6.36">do so and countries now are fighting</text>
  <text start="240.19" dur="6.95">back and Brussels right now is mounting</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="6.21">a legal fight to fight these countries</text>
  <text start="247.14" dur="6.34">into complying with their refugee quotas</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="5.82">so we can see there&amp;#39;s a lot of problems</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="4.5">going on and it looks like the elite</text>
  <text start="255.94" dur="4.74">well they&amp;#39;re back against the wall and</text>
  <text start="257.98" dur="6.15">they want certain things to happen and</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re just not happening now we see</text>
  <text start="264.13" dur="6.69">Ukraine well this is now coming into the</text>
  <text start="267.52" dur="7.11">mist the the mix they have cut the</text>
  <text start="270.82" dur="6.54">energy to the Donetsk area they&amp;#39;re left</text>
  <text start="274.63" dur="5.25">totally in the dark so the electricity</text>
  <text start="277.36" dur="4.86">supplies are cut off now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.88" dur="5.85">seeing and I believe that the elite</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="6.81">right now the deep state the neocons the</text>
  <text start="285.73" dur="6.26">bad guys they are going all out right</text>
  <text start="289.03" dur="5.43">now trying to get something started</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="4.3">because think about what is happening</text>
  <text start="294.46" dur="4.29">right now we see the corporate media out</text>
  <text start="296.29" dur="3.78">there and they&amp;#39;re saying North Korea is</text>
  <text start="298.75" dur="4.5">getting ready to fire another missile</text>
  <text start="300.07" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s going to be an ICBM they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="303.25" dur="3.39">all this propaganda coming out saying</text>
  <text start="304.9" dur="3.63">North Korea is going to be striking the</text>
  <text start="306.64" dur="3.78">United States they&amp;#39;re getting prepared</text>
  <text start="308.53" dur="3.63">to hit the United States States they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.42" dur="4.14">going to you know use the nuclear hammer</text>
  <text start="312.16" dur="5.55">and all this came out because the CIA</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="5">Chief Mark Mike Pompeo suggested regime</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="3.83">change now North Korea understand</text>
  <text start="319.56" dur="5.82">and that this is what they want to do</text>
  <text start="321.54" dur="7.26">and the corporate media is trying to</text>
  <text start="325.38" dur="5.43">provoke this into happening the elite</text>
  <text start="328.8" dur="6.3">the deep state the bad guys they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.81" dur="7.62">pushing this to happen now out in South</text>
  <text start="335.1" dur="6.47">Korea we can see that army general</text>
  <text start="338.43" dur="5.1">Vincent Brooks is saying listen an</text>
  <text start="341.57" dur="4.96">intercontinental ballistic missile this</text>
  <text start="343.53" dur="4.47">is a game-changer and this heightens the</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="2.81">risk that the nation will be able to hit</text>
  <text start="348" dur="4.8">the United States sooner than expected</text>
  <text start="349.34" dur="5.65">they are really playing this up right</text>
  <text start="352.8" dur="4.74">now because it looks like they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="354.99" dur="4.2">to be pushing their agenda in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="357.54" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing the agenda</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="5.07">with North Korea and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="361.83" dur="4.8">pushing their agenda in Syria the only</text>
  <text start="364.26" dur="4.02">problem in Syria is they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="5.49">losing the battle and I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="368.28" dur="6.42">they have that much left there but out</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="7.08">in Syria what we are seeing at this</text>
  <text start="374.7" dur="8.73">point is that the moderate rebels the</text>
  <text start="379.2" dur="6.6">Islamic state al Qaeda al sham it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="383.43" dur="5.28">falling apart right now and we know that</text>
  <text start="385.8" dur="4.88">Trump has already said listen Libya is</text>
  <text start="388.71" dur="4.59">going to have to take care of itself</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="5.91">Lebanon is going to have to take care of</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="5.22">itself he&amp;#39;s looking to withdraw troops</text>
  <text start="396.59" dur="5.59">from Syria</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="6.6">he&amp;#39;s already stopped the funding to the</text>
  <text start="402.18" dur="7.83">moderate rebels and they&amp;#39;ve cut off most</text>
  <text start="405.12" dur="7.47">of the black or dark money going into</text>
  <text start="410.01" dur="5.67">the terrorist groups so they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="412.59" dur="5.84">very rough time now Russia just signed a</text>
  <text start="415.68" dur="4.62">federal law on the ratification of the</text>
  <text start="418.43" dur="3.7">protocol and agreement of the</text>
  <text start="420.3" dur="6.06">establishment of the Syrian Army Air</text>
  <text start="422.13" dur="7.5">Force for 49 years so basically what is</text>
  <text start="426.36" dur="6.809">going to happen here is that Russia will</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="5.97">have access to the airbase in Syria for</text>
  <text start="433.169" dur="6.331">basically the next 50 years which means</text>
  <text start="435.6" dur="8.28">that Russia is going nowhere in Syria</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="7.77">now once again we can see what is</text>
  <text start="443.88" dur="5.82">happening here Russia is setting up</text>
  <text start="447.27" dur="5.82">saying the United States will go no</text>
  <text start="449.7" dur="6.36">further the deep state their plan well</text>
  <text start="453.09" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s down the toilet here and we can see</text>
  <text start="456.06" dur="4.5">already that Trump he gets this he</text>
  <text start="458.25" dur="5.22">understands this we see already that</text>
  <text start="460.56" dur="5.04">he&amp;#39;s looking to bring troops out of</text>
  <text start="463.47" dur="4.35">Syria and bringing back to the United</text>
  <text start="465.6" dur="5.22">States he&amp;#39;s also looking at Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="467.82" dur="4.95">and he wants an investigation of what</text>
  <text start="470.82" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;ve been doing there for 17 years he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="5.34">made no decision as of right now to</text>
  <text start="475.68" dur="3.9">bring troops into Afghanistan and if you</text>
  <text start="478.11" dur="3.33">notice he always says well we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="479.58" dur="3.36">we&amp;#39;ll see what we&amp;#39;re going to do and I</text>
  <text start="481.44" dur="4.17">think what he&amp;#39;s trying to do he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="482.94" dur="6.21">putting this off right now because he</text>
  <text start="485.61" dur="6.21">realizes what is happening and basically</text>
  <text start="489.15" dur="4.17">he has a very big decision because</text>
  <text start="491.82" dur="4.05">either we&amp;#39;re going to go down the path</text>
  <text start="493.32" dur="4.319">with the deep state the neocons which</text>
  <text start="495.87" dur="3.96">hopefully we&amp;#39;re not going down this path</text>
  <text start="497.639" dur="4.681">or we&amp;#39;re going to be going down the path</text>
  <text start="499.83" dur="6.089">where you know something the empire</text>
  <text start="502.32" dur="5.31">building is over and it&amp;#39;s time to bring</text>
  <text start="505.919" dur="4.231">everyone home now</text>
  <text start="507.63" dur="6.149">this Russian bill that was just passed</text>
  <text start="510.15" dur="5.009">passed by the house he&amp;#39;s going to have</text>
  <text start="513.779" dur="3.471">to make a decision of what he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="515.159" dur="6.901">do here now corporations</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="8.53">the EU they&amp;#39;re all telling him this is a</text>
  <text start="522.06" dur="6.9">bad idea and if you go through with this</text>
  <text start="525.78" dur="5.67">this is not going to turn out well for</text>
  <text start="528.96" dur="3.87">the United States they&amp;#39;re not saying</text>
  <text start="531.45" dur="2.76">it&amp;#39;s not going to turn out well for</text>
  <text start="532.83" dur="4.44">Russia think about what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="534.21" dur="5.49">right now they&amp;#39;re out there saying we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="537.27" dur="7.8">going to retaliate against the United</text>
  <text start="539.7" dur="7.139">States Europe you know our allies and we</text>
  <text start="545.07" dur="4.56">can see corporations are saying listen</text>
  <text start="546.839" dur="5.401">this is going to hurt businesses this is</text>
  <text start="549.63" dur="7.53">not going to be a good thing so once</text>
  <text start="552.24" dur="7.469">again those individuals in Congress who</text>
  <text start="557.16" dur="5.91">are pushing this they&amp;#39;re not doing it</text>
  <text start="559.709" dur="5.581">for the people of United States they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="563.07" dur="5.519">not doing this to make the situation</text>
  <text start="565.29" dur="7.71">better they&amp;#39;re doing it to keep their</text>
  <text start="568.589" dur="8.131">system alive that&amp;#39;s the main purpose of</text>
  <text start="573" dur="7.38">this because if they can continually say</text>
  <text start="576.72" dur="6.15">that Russia is the enemy they can have</text>
  <text start="580.38" dur="5.579">their board this is what they really</text>
  <text start="582.87" dur="3.87">want the elite right now they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="585.959" dur="3.061">whatever they</text>
  <text start="586.74" dur="5.25">possibly can to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="589.02" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re going all out right now we might</text>
  <text start="591.99" dur="5.61">even see an event if they can actually</text>
  <text start="593.73" dur="5.64">pull it off I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re able</text>
  <text start="597.6" dur="5.79">to do it but they might be able to do it</text>
  <text start="599.37" dur="5.61">and Trump he&amp;#39;s going to be screwed no</text>
  <text start="603.39" dur="4.59">matter which way he turns it makes no</text>
  <text start="604.98" dur="4.95">difference at this point because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.98" dur="4.56">either you&amp;#39;re go against the</text>
  <text start="609.93" dur="4.8">corporations and the EU or you go</text>
  <text start="612.54" dur="4.14">against the corporate media personally I</text>
  <text start="614.73" dur="5.549">think you just say all right corporate</text>
  <text start="616.68" dur="6.029">media I&amp;#39;m doing it we&amp;#39;re repairing</text>
  <text start="620.279" dur="5.461">relations with Russia deal with it and</text>
  <text start="622.709" dur="4.801">let them flounder about make up all this</text>
  <text start="625.74" dur="5.82">different stuff and let them go through</text>
  <text start="627.51" dur="7.38">the motions and basically this might</text>
  <text start="631.56" dur="5.61">have to happen because if the EU decides</text>
  <text start="634.89" dur="4.5">because they could do a couple of things</text>
  <text start="637.17" dur="3.479">here where you know the United States</text>
  <text start="639.39" dur="3.36">says you know we&amp;#39;re going to supply you</text>
  <text start="640.649" dur="3.75">gas we&amp;#39;re going to help out they might</text>
  <text start="642.75" dur="3.81">just say you know something you just put</text>
  <text start="644.399" dur="4.171">sanctions on Russia we&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="646.56" dur="3.51">against everything that you just did</text>
  <text start="648.57" dur="3.68">we&amp;#39;re going to buy the gas from Russia</text>
  <text start="650.07" dur="4.079">we&amp;#39;re going to be joining the Silk Road</text>
  <text start="652.25" dur="4.089">we&amp;#39;re going to be joining the belton</text>
  <text start="654.149" dur="6.481">Road we&amp;#39;re going to do everything with</text>
  <text start="656.339" dur="6.861">China and Russia screw the US so what</text>
  <text start="660.63" dur="7.35">does the US have at this point</text>
  <text start="663.2" dur="6.61">absolutely nothing so he has a huge</text>
  <text start="667.98" dur="4.5">decision to make now maybe he can</text>
  <text start="669.81" dur="4.11">negotiate his way out of this maybe he</text>
  <text start="672.48" dur="6.99">can come up with something completely</text>
  <text start="673.92" dur="7.979">different that maybe you know makes both</text>
  <text start="679.47" dur="6.78">sides happy I don&amp;#39;t know if he has that</text>
  <text start="681.899" dur="6.331">ability maybe he can but we see at this</text>
  <text start="686.25" dur="4.649">point that things are coming down to the</text>
  <text start="688.23" dur="5.94">wire and I think this is why at this</text>
  <text start="690.899" dur="5.13">time he&amp;#39;s pushing sessions he&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="694.17" dur="4.26">them let&amp;#39;s start the investigations</text>
  <text start="696.029" dur="5.761">let&amp;#39;s go after the leakers it&amp;#39;s enough</text>
