  <text start="38.27" dur="4.89">sep tember 10th 2015 and the title this</text>
  <text start="40.7" dur="5.46">episode is us propaganda being used to</text>
  <text start="43.16" dur="4.68">push the war with Syria and Russia now</text>
  <text start="46.16" dur="3.3">before I get started I just want to make</text>
  <text start="47.84" dur="4.59">an announcement of what happened</text>
  <text start="49.46" dur="5.37">yesterday and today with the site the</text>
  <text start="52.43" dur="4.59">site was attacked it started at midnight</text>
  <text start="54.83" dur="6.33">and went all through the morning and it</text>
  <text start="57.02" dur="6.48">really got really intense around six or</text>
  <text start="61.16" dur="4.38">seven in the morning or so and the</text>
  <text start="63.5" dur="3.81">hosting company decided that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="65.54" dur="3.51">want to have this interfere with their</text>
  <text start="67.31" dur="4.46">other customers so they disconnected the</text>
  <text start="69.05" dur="5.16">database so the site went down and</text>
  <text start="71.77" dur="5.29">during that time they said the site was</text>
  <text start="74.21" dur="4.59">compromised yes something has happened</text>
  <text start="77.06" dur="4.68">they don&amp;#39;t know exactly what it is and</text>
  <text start="78.8" dur="5.429">what I started to do was take the</text>
  <text start="81.74" dur="6.42">database and the files and move them to</text>
  <text start="84.229" dur="6.211">a backup server so this way the site and</text>
  <text start="88.16" dur="5.4">go back up and run and this is what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="90.44" dur="4.83">doing I&amp;#39;m creating the primary and a</text>
  <text start="93.56" dur="3.87">backup server so if this ever happens</text>
  <text start="95.27" dur="4.59">again I can switch right over to the</text>
  <text start="97.43" dur="5.31">backup server but yes the site was</text>
  <text start="99.86" dur="6">attacked it brought it down and it took</text>
  <text start="102.74" dur="5.25">me pretty much the entire day to get it</text>
  <text start="105.86" dur="4.53">up and running once again but it looks</text>
  <text start="107.99" dur="4.44">like the site is running it looks like</text>
  <text start="110.39" dur="5.01">everything is back to normal a couple</text>
  <text start="112.43" dur="4.38">things I need to fix the forum maybe</text>
  <text start="115.4" dur="3.45">some other little things here and there</text>
  <text start="116.81" dur="5.36">but it looks like everything is back to</text>
  <text start="118.85" dur="7.44">normal I know everyone was emailing me</text>
  <text start="122.17" dur="6.16">commenting on YouTube and I tried to</text>
  <text start="126.29" dur="3.57">answer some people I put some comments</text>
  <text start="128.33" dur="4.08">on YouTube to let you know the site was</text>
  <text start="129.86" dur="5.07">attacked the best place I think to go</text>
  <text start="132.41" dur="5.28">when something like this does occur is</text>
  <text start="134.93" dur="6.809">the Twitter account which is Twitter</text>
  <text start="137.69" dur="6.24">sports / x 22 report and there I was</text>
  <text start="141.739" dur="5.22">updating what was happening so if you</text>
  <text start="143.93" dur="5.22">wanted to follow x 22 report on twitter</text>
  <text start="146.959" dur="3.78">you can do that in this way i can get</text>
  <text start="149.15" dur="4.44">the message out there of what is</text>
  <text start="150.739" dur="5.821">happening because it&amp;#39;s just impossible</text>
  <text start="153.59" dur="4.89">for me to answer all the emails that are</text>
  <text start="156.56" dur="4.799">coming in and work on the server again</text>
  <text start="158.48" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;m a one-man shop here I don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="161.359" dur="5.041">crew of people working</text>
  <text start="163.79" dur="4.559">it&amp;#39;s just me so I can&amp;#39;t be in all places</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="4.88">at once but I do appreciate everyone</text>
  <text start="168.349" dur="5.491">everyone&amp;#39;s concern what was going on and</text>
  <text start="171.28" dur="5.14">I was just concentrating on getting</text>
  <text start="173.84" dur="4.05">everything back to normal let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="176.42" dur="6.539">right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="10.2">geopolitical news now we understand at</text>
  <text start="182.959" dur="7.62">this point in the game that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="188.09" dur="4.519">government the central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="190.579" dur="5.16">really going to push propaganda</text>
  <text start="192.609" dur="8.371">everywhere and they&amp;#39;re going to push</text>
  <text start="195.739" dur="9.93">certain bills certain laws and we know</text>
  <text start="200.98" dur="8.289">they will not stop taking away our</text>
  <text start="205.669" dur="5.82">rights they&amp;#39;re going to go completely</text>
  <text start="209.269" dur="4.08">full throttle on this we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="211.489" dur="3.87">seeing it with all these fake shootings</text>
  <text start="213.349" dur="4.381">and I looked at the Virginia shooting</text>
  <text start="215.359" dur="4.651">once again and I see a lot of people</text>
  <text start="217.73" dur="4.14">doing a lot of hard work on this and I</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="3.78">see and I have the original video and</text>
  <text start="221.87" dur="5.549">they&amp;#39;re absolutely right the gun that</text>
  <text start="223.79" dur="7.619">was firing there are no shells popping</text>
  <text start="227.419" dur="7.051">out of it and I see a lot of</text>
  <text start="231.409" dur="6.841">inconsistencies in the story but what</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="9.18">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is using all</text>
  <text start="238.25" dur="8.639">these staged shootings to try to get the</text>
  <text start="243.65" dur="5.13">gun laws passed to remove these rights</text>
  <text start="246.889" dur="5.761">from the people and we&amp;#39;re gonna see this</text>
  <text start="248.78" dur="8.449">ramp up a lot coming up because Obama</text>
  <text start="252.65" dur="9.98">has already stated this has to be done</text>
  <text start="257.229" dur="7.81">before he leaves office and we know that</text>
  <text start="262.63" dur="6.58">most of these I&amp;#39;m not saying all of them</text>
  <text start="265.039" dur="7.62">but most of them are completely fake to</text>
  <text start="269.21" dur="5.19">make people believe that guns are bad</text>
  <text start="272.659" dur="3">but instead you need to look at the</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="3.21">source it&amp;#39;s almost like when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="275.659" dur="3.781">driving down the road and someone hits</text>
  <text start="277.61" dur="5.779">you with the car or crashes into you I</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="7.5">mean back in God when was this back in</text>
  <text start="283.389" dur="6.191">1992 I was in a head or head-on</text>
  <text start="286.94" dur="5.46">collision I didn&amp;#39;t get hurt or anything</text>
  <text start="289.58" dur="5.88">like that but the person who hit me</text>
  <text start="292.4" dur="5.479">backed up with my bumper in their bumper</text>
  <text start="295.46" dur="6.829">one around me and left</text>
  <text start="297.879" dur="9.1">come to find out that person was drunk</text>
  <text start="302.289" dur="8.44">now did I blame the car no it was the</text>
  <text start="306.979" dur="6.69">person using the car as a weapon the</text>
  <text start="310.729" dur="5.58">same thing with guns the same thing with</text>
  <text start="313.669" dur="6.06">knives with axes it&amp;#39;s not the weapon</text>
  <text start="316.309" dur="5.91">weapon can&amp;#39;t do anything by itself so</text>
  <text start="319.729" dur="5.01">when we see this we need to go to the</text>
  <text start="322.219" dur="4.68">source of why this is happening and if</text>
  <text start="324.739" dur="4.92">we look most of these people are on</text>
  <text start="326.899" dur="6.93">medications most of these people have</text>
  <text start="329.659" dur="8.16">mental problems and the FBI and other</text>
  <text start="333.829" dur="6.57">agencies use them and convince them to</text>
  <text start="337.819" dur="3.87">do things they normally wouldn&amp;#39;t do or</text>
  <text start="340.399" dur="5.63">they might even take the motor</text>
  <text start="341.689" dur="4.34">medication which actually makes it worse</text>
  <text start="346.389" dur="3.55">but of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="348.649" dur="2.91">doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk about that they</text>
  <text start="349.939" dur="3.15">just want to talk about the gun now if</text>
  <text start="351.559" dur="3.63">someone went around with a knife and</text>
  <text start="353.089" dur="4.17">stab someone and this happens many many</text>
  <text start="355.189" dur="4.05">times with a bat with an axe with it</text>
  <text start="357.259" dur="4.77">with a knife there are many many stories</text>
  <text start="359.239" dur="4.53">across the net about this the corporate</text>
  <text start="362.029" dur="4.2">media doesn&amp;#39;t want to touch that because</text>
  <text start="363.769" dur="4.68">that doesn&amp;#39;t push their agenda their</text>
  <text start="366.229" dur="4.65">agenda is to get to get the weapons away</text>
  <text start="368.449" dur="3.661">from the people because when you remove</text>
  <text start="370.879" dur="4.231">the weapons from the people the people</text>
  <text start="372.11" dur="5.519">can be controlled when the people have</text>
  <text start="375.11" dur="5.279">the weapons they can control the</text>
  <text start="377.629" dur="6.51">government and they know this and this</text>
  <text start="380.389" dur="6.74">is why they&amp;#39;re pushing so hard now a lot</text>
  <text start="384.139" dur="5.55">of the big corporations are still</text>
  <text start="387.129" dur="5.68">fighting the US government we know the</text>
  <text start="389.689" dur="4.65">FBI and other agencies they want not</text>
  <text start="392.809" dur="3.06">even back doors anymore they just want</text>
  <text start="394.339" dur="3.45">to come right through the front and they</text>
  <text start="395.869" dur="4.89">want the method and the keys to</text>
  <text start="397.789" dur="5.34">encryption and it looks like Microsoft</text>
  <text start="400.759" dur="4.5">right now Apple and many others are</text>
  <text start="403.129" dur="5.82">continually battling the US government</text>
  <text start="405.259" dur="6.63">in federal Pierce appeals court and many</text>
  <text start="408.949" dur="6.18">customers now are looking to smaller</text>
  <text start="411.889" dur="5.61">email encryption services and there are</text>
  <text start="415.129" dur="5.22">many out there that you can either get</text>
  <text start="417.499" dur="6.63">them for free or pay a small fee to have</text>
  <text start="420.349" dur="5.67">the encryption and everyone at this</text>
  <text start="424.129" dur="4.32">point needs to really protect themselves</text>
  <text start="426.019" dur="4.62">from what is happening here I mean we</text>
  <text start="428.449" dur="2.701">see right now that the government will</text>
  <text start="430.639" dur="2.971">do what</text>
  <text start="431.15" dur="5.43">ever they have to do to get the</text>
  <text start="433.61" dur="7.19">information from the people and it they</text>
  <text start="436.58" dur="8.01">don&amp;#39;t care how I mean they want to know</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="7.89">what you are doing where you&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="444.59" dur="4.1">your purchases where you&amp;#39;re driving</text>
  <text start="449.26" dur="9.4">what&amp;#39;s in your email what your texting</text>
  <text start="454.33" dur="8.74">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter they want all of this</text>
  <text start="458.66" dur="9.6">information and they have no right to</text>
  <text start="463.07" dur="8.13">have it and you need to use different</text>
  <text start="468.26" dur="5.46">functionality different applications</text>
  <text start="471.2" dur="5.25">different products to protect yourself</text>
  <text start="473.72" dur="6.17">they&amp;#39;re out there you just need to use</text>
  <text start="476.45" dur="8.07">them startpage calm you can use that</text>
  <text start="479.89" dur="7.18">that will mask your searches to Google</text>
  <text start="484.52" dur="4.71">you can also use their proxies and I</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="4.47">know some of the proxies in there don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="489.23" dur="5.04">allow you to see the full web page</text>
  <text start="491.54" dur="4.5">because a lot of sites will limit it but</text>
  <text start="494.27" dur="6.06">it is there for you to use everything is</text>
  <text start="496.04" dur="8.25">not perfect I mean you can write your</text>
  <text start="500.33" dur="6.27">own encryption or find encryption to use</text>
  <text start="504.29" dur="4.59">use an email surface that has encryption</text>
  <text start="506.6" dur="5.1">just to make it a little bit more</text>
  <text start="508.88" dur="4.71">difficult for the government because</text>
  <text start="511.7" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s no there&amp;#39;s no reason they need</text>
  <text start="513.59" dur="4.11">to read what you&amp;#39;re writing or what</text>
  <text start="515.51" dur="6.06">you&amp;#39;re saying you can use block a pocket</text>
  <text start="517.7" dur="6.09">com that&amp;#39;s a sleeve that fits your phone</text>
  <text start="521.57" dur="4.77">your iPad your credit card your driver&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.79" dur="5.88">license there&amp;#39;s its interwoven with</text>
  <text start="526.34" dur="4.92">copper silver and other metals to block</text>
  <text start="529.67" dur="2.82">the signal and we know the driver&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="3.24">license are going to come with the RFID</text>
  <text start="532.49" dur="5.19">chips they&amp;#39;re gonna have a bar code on</text>
  <text start="534.5" dur="4.59">the back this will all be sent up to a</text>
  <text start="537.68" dur="3.57">central database and they&amp;#39;ll have all</text>
  <text start="539.09" dur="5.76">the information on you and the RFID chip</text>
  <text start="541.25" dur="6.21">is to track you credit cards have RFID</text>
  <text start="544.85" dur="3.93">chips already in them and they broadcast</text>
  <text start="547.46" dur="4.31">all the time and people walking by with</text>
  <text start="548.78" dur="6.27">the scanner can steal your information</text>
  <text start="551.77" dur="5.95">actually now it&amp;#39;s even easier to get the</text>
  <text start="555.05" dur="4.8">information and these sleeves just block</text>
  <text start="557.72" dur="4.05">it same thing with your phone you slip</text>
  <text start="559.85" dur="3.17">it in there it blocks the signal you</text>
  <text start="561.77" dur="3.02">can&amp;#39;t be tracked</text>
  <text start="563.02" dur="3.39">so there are ways to do this and</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="5.19">everyone needs to do this because the</text>
  <text start="566.41" dur="5.96">FBI the US government they will not stop</text>
  <text start="569.98" dur="6.12">until they get their way and guess what</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="5.65">while they&amp;#39;re fighting they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="576.1" dur="3.3">doing it anyhow because they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="578.02" dur="3.14">they don&amp;#39;t care about the Bill of Rights</text>
  <text start="579.4" dur="5.34">they don&amp;#39;t care about the Constitution</text>
  <text start="581.16" dur="5.38">we&amp;#39;re heading towards the endgame I mean</text>
  <text start="584.74" dur="3.57">they would love nothing less to but to</text>
  <text start="586.54" dur="4.47">get rid of it they get rid of all your</text>
  <text start="588.31" dur="6.63">rights and this is where we&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="591.01" dur="8.15">right now we&amp;#39;re moving towards this now</text>
  <text start="594.94" dur="7.2">in Spain we understand that Catalonia</text>
  <text start="599.16" dur="6.04">wants to have a vote and they want to</text>
  <text start="602.14" dur="6.18">secede from Spain but Spain is saying</text>
  <text start="605.2" dur="5.61">absolutely not we will not let this</text>
  <text start="608.32" dur="7.37">happen span a Spanish Defense Minister</text>
  <text start="610.81" dur="10.67">has said that he will send out the army</text>
  <text start="615.69" dur="9.46">if they vote catalonia away from spain</text>

  <text start="626.08" dur="7.11">back independence and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="631.57" dur="4.47">have to watch this very very carefully</text>
  <text start="633.19" dur="6.33">because we could see War break out in</text>
  <text start="636.04" dur="8.51">Spain actually we see it happening</text>
  <text start="639.52" dur="9.66">everywhere now things are on the edge I</text>
  <text start="644.55" dur="7.06">mean if you really take a look and you</text>
  <text start="649.18" dur="6.12">really look around everything is</text>
  <text start="651.61" dur="6.21">starting to ramp up propaganda is being</text>

  <text start="1618.55" dur="8.64">always the same now we understand cyber</text>
  <text start="1624.13" dur="5.49">attacks are going to be used for the</text>
  <text start="1627.19" dur="3.99">main event and trend micro right Trend</text>
  <text start="1629.62" dur="3.12">Micro right now review</text>
  <text start="1631.18" dur="5.37">in the second quarter security roundup</text>
  <text start="1632.74" dur="6.63">report that the nature of attacks are</text>
  <text start="1636.55" dur="5.37">evolving and they&amp;#39;re not just going</text>
  <text start="1639.37" dur="5.46">after you know the corporate websites</text>
  <text start="1641.92" dur="5.91">and those things they&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="1644.83" dur="5.48">attacks are now focused on internet</text>
  <text start="1647.83" dur="5.43">connected physical infrastructure</text>
  <text start="1650.31" dur="7.06">they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s been a huge</text>
  <text start="1653.26" dur="7.05">increase and the attacks are becoming</text>
  <text start="1657.37" dur="7.32">more and more advanced as time goes on</text>
  <text start="1660.31" dur="7.68">and the reason for this is because they</text>
  <text start="1664.69" dur="5.52">are preparing and getting ready to bring</text>
  <text start="1667.99" dur="5.07">down parts of the infrastructure here in</text>
  <text start="1670.21" dur="5.79">this country because they need to do</text>
  <text start="1673.06" dur="9.96">this to prove to everyone that Russia</text>
  <text start="1676" dur="10.38">China the Islamic state these are the</text>
  <text start="1683.02" dur="5.18">enemies and they tacked America they</text>
  <text start="1686.38" dur="4.77">can&amp;#39;t just do it in one little location</text>
  <text start="1688.2" dur="6.73">they this has to be a coordinated effort</text>
  <text start="1691.15" dur="6.87">around the country to happen all at once</text>
  <text start="1694.93" dur="6.69">they tried this with 911 to coordinate</text>
  <text start="1698.02" dur="7.02">it I didn&amp;#39;t work out as planned because</text>
  <text start="1701.62" dur="5.49">again they&amp;#39;re not perfect they&amp;#39;re bump</text>
  <text start="1705.04" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re basically a bunch of bumbling</text>
  <text start="1707.11" dur="5.43">idiots that kind of get things done</text>
  <text start="1709.75" dur="7.02">sometimes not at all they make a lot of</text>
  <text start="1712.54" dur="5.55">errors but we see at this point they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1716.77" dur="3.51">been planning this for a long time this</text>
  <text start="1718.09" dur="4.94">is not something they do overnight this</text>
  <text start="1720.28" dur="6.32">has been planned for a very long time</text>
  <text start="1723.03" dur="6.01">operatives are already in position</text>
  <text start="1726.6" dur="4.72">everything is ready to go there just</text>
  <text start="1729.04" dur="5.06">waiting for the green light the same</text>
  <text start="1731.32" dur="7.19">thing with 911 and then we see the</text>
  <text start="1734.1" dur="8.53">airspace up and down the east coast is</text>
  <text start="1738.51" dur="7.36">completely unreliable with certain radar</text>
  <text start="1742.63" dur="6.3">systems and tracking systems and</text>
  <text start="1745.87" dur="6.69">directional systems and this is going to</text>
  <text start="1748.93" dur="5.97">be going until October so we need to be</text>
  <text start="1752.56" dur="3.69">on the lookout for something to occur or</text>
  <text start="1754.9" dur="5.91">it might be something completely</text>
  <text start="1756.25" dur="7.08">different that we we didn&amp;#39;t even say so</text>
  <text start="1760.81" dur="3.97">every little piece of information we</text>
  <text start="1763.33" dur="3.76">should be looking at</text>
  <text start="1764.78" dur="4.95">and we need to call them out on it as</text>
