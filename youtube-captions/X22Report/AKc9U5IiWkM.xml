  <text start="177.38" dur="3.66">Greece saying this is this should have</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="2.61">been done a long time ago instead of</text>
  <text start="181.04" dur="4.979">bringing it on the</text>
  <text start="181.7" dur="6.02">people and this is a very hot topic when</text>
  <text start="186.019" dur="4.591">they&amp;#39;re talking about deputy salaries</text>
  <text start="187.72" dur="4.45">especially in the Greek media because it</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="3.53">creates social tension people are very</text>
  <text start="192.17" dur="4.349">upset you know why do we always have to</text>

  <text start="221.45" dur="5.16">don&amp;#39;t cut the people first and keep</text>
  <text start="224.209" dur="6.331">yourself living fantastically because</text>
  <text start="226.61" dur="6.06">then you can&amp;#39;t feel what the people feel</text>
  <text start="230.54" dur="3.779">because you&amp;#39;re completely separated from</text>
  <text start="232.67" dur="3.87">them I don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="234.319" dur="4.831">about I have a driver I&amp;#39;m getting these</text>
  <text start="236.54" dur="4.979">great meals I have a golf course I have</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="4.74">fantastic salary there are no problems</text>
  <text start="241.519" dur="3.931">in the country and I agree with that</text>
  <text start="243.89" dur="3.84">even here in the United States when the</text>
  <text start="245.45" dur="5.009">government shuts down because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="247.73" dur="6.659">raise the debt ceiling those people who</text>
  <text start="250.459" dur="6.27">are in power in Congress well shut down</text>
  <text start="254.389" dur="5.25">the golf course shut down the hotel</text>
  <text start="256.729" dur="6.391">expenditures get rid of their health</text>
  <text start="259.639" dur="5.611">insurance get rid of their pensions one</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="4.59">at a time instead of affecting the</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="7.19">people that&amp;#39;s where they should be doing</text>
  <text start="267.71" dur="7.37">it so they realize what is going on now</text>
  <text start="272.44" dur="6.01">yesterday we talked about how the</text>
  <text start="275.08" dur="5.62">conference board reported that consumer</text>
  <text start="278.45" dur="3.75">confidence is the highest that they have</text>
  <text start="280.7" dur="3.36">ever seen now remember the conference</text>
  <text start="282.2" dur="4.41">board well they get grants from the</text>
  <text start="284.06" dur="3.81">government and that&amp;#39;s manipulated to</text>
  <text start="286.61" dur="4.5">make you think that everything is</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="6.6">fantastic and when we look at it what do</text>
  <text start="291.11" dur="6.92">we see well we see what we always seen</text>
  <text start="294.47" dur="5.759">in the past where the Gallup survey</text>
  <text start="298.03" dur="4.75">where they ran there they survey a</text>
  <text start="300.229" dur="4.081">random group of about 3,500 adults they</text>
  <text start="302.78" dur="3.24">found something completely different</text>
  <text start="304.31" dur="4.5">than what the government is putting out</text>
  <text start="306.02" dur="5.49">there which we&amp;#39;ve seen this in the past</text>
  <text start="308.81" dur="5">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the</text>
  <text start="311.51" dur="3.85">Americans confidence in the US economy</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="3.379">tumbled a</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="4.649">along with the Dow Jones Industrial</text>
  <text start="317.189" dur="6.121">Average last week it&amp;#39;s still in positive</text>
  <text start="320.009" dur="6.421">territory but it is dropped six points</text>
  <text start="323.31" dur="4.62">the week ending March 26th this is the</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="3.449">lowest weekly average since the</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="5.16">presidential election in November</text>
  <text start="329.879" dur="5.25">so the Gallup survey is reporting</text>
  <text start="333.09" dur="5.009">something completely different than the</text>
  <text start="335.129" dur="5.461">conference board and again we can see</text>
  <text start="338.099" dur="4.41">that when these numbers are taken from</text>
  <text start="340.59" dur="3.09">directly from the people we see</text>
  <text start="342.509" dur="3.361">something completely different</text>
  <text start="343.68" dur="3.84">especially when the government has their</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="5.039">hands in statistics like the</text>
  <text start="347.52" dur="5.73">unemployment like GDP like consumer</text>
  <text start="350.909" dur="4.801">confidence and all this we always see</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="4.74">different numbers because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="355.71" dur="4.949">skewing it in a way to make you believe</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="4.649">and convince you that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="360.659" dur="4.53">and they&amp;#39;ve been doing it in the past</text>
  <text start="362.639" dur="4.351">and they&amp;#39;re continually doing it they</text>
  <text start="365.189" dur="4.771">haven&amp;#39;t stopped now there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="5.039">talk about minimum wage hikes where</text>
  <text start="369.96" dur="4.41">people say yes we have to raise the</text>
  <text start="372.029" dur="5.461">minimum wage it will help the poor it</text>
  <text start="374.37" dur="5.82">will be better and the opposite argument</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="4.019">is that if you do do this well it</text>
  <text start="380.19" dur="3.42">doesn&amp;#39;t make things better and if you go</text>
  <text start="381.509" dur="4.291">back in time you can see that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="383.61" dur="4.2">raised the minimum wage many many times</text>
  <text start="385.8" dur="4.38">I mean I remember when I was back in</text>
  <text start="387.81" dur="5.52">high school the minimum wage was around</text>
  <text start="390.18" dur="5.159">3035 cents and now we can see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="393.33" dur="4.049">already you know up to 11 dollars or</text>
  <text start="395.339" dur="4.161">whatever it is twelve dollars and we can</text>
  <text start="397.379" dur="5.641">see that this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="399.5" dur="6.159">continuing problem unless we get rid of</text>
  <text start="403.02" dur="5.519">the central bank we&amp;#39;ve never gone to the</text>
  <text start="405.659" dur="6.87">heart of the problem and as you raise</text>
  <text start="408.539" dur="5.761">the minimum wage it helps a few number</text>
  <text start="412.529" dur="4.26">of people but again what happens is the</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="4.53">value of the dollar decreases and that</text>
  <text start="416.789" dur="4.261">minimum wage really doesn&amp;#39;t help out</text>
  <text start="418.83" dur="4.53">anymore and there is a study that was</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="5.03">done from dr. David Macpherson of</text>
  <text start="423.36" dur="6.959">Trinity University and dr. William even</text>
  <text start="426.08" dur="7.149">of Miami University pointing out the</text>
  <text start="430.319" dur="5.4">devastating consequences of minimum wage</text>
  <text start="433.229" dur="4.86">hikes the study takes a look at the city</text>
  <text start="435.719" dur="4.92">of st. Louis and its decision to hike</text>
  <text start="438.089" dur="5.73">minimum wage rates by forty three</text>
  <text start="440.639" dur="6.06">percent by 2018 from seven dollars and</text>
  <text start="443.819" dur="3.291">70 cents per hour to eleven dollars per</text>
  <text start="446.699" dur="2.55">hour</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="5.049">McPhearson figures such a high</text>
  <text start="449.249" dur="4.53">the city roughly a thousand jobs and as</text>
  <text start="452.159" dur="4.35">usual will hurt the young endless</text>
  <text start="453.779" dur="6.15">skilled workers the most he notes the</text>
  <text start="456.509" dur="5.7">minimum wage hikes often don&amp;#39;t help the</text>
  <text start="459.929" dur="4.02">poor at least those that are able to</text>
  <text start="462.209" dur="4.08">keep their jobs after the layoff notices</text>
  <text start="463.949" dur="4.11">are passed out but instead flow to the</text>
  <text start="466.289" dur="4.65">teenage workers of more affluent</text>
  <text start="468.059" dur="4.8">families beyond the consequences to the</text>
  <text start="470.939" dur="4.83">labor market raising the minimum wage</text>
  <text start="472.859" dur="4.83">has been criticized on the grounds that</text>
  <text start="475.769" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s poorly targeted to low income</text>
  <text start="477.689" dur="3.6">families for instance an early analysis</text>
  <text start="480.029" dur="3.45">found that the average family income</text>
  <text start="481.289" dur="4.79">event of a beneficiary of a twelve</text>
  <text start="483.479" dur="6.12">dollar minimum wage in Missouri exceeds</text>
  <text start="486.079" dur="5.2">$50,000 a year many of the employees are</text>
  <text start="489.599" dur="2.7">second or third earners and higher</text>
  <text start="491.279" dur="2.97">income household</text>
  <text start="492.299" dur="3.811">similarly the Census Bureau data showed</text>
  <text start="494.249" dur="3.87">that over a half fifty-two percent of</text>
  <text start="496.11" dur="4.139">the state&amp;#39;s poor residents don&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="498.119" dur="5.55">and wouldn&amp;#39;t be impacted by the raise at</text>
  <text start="500.249" dur="6.27">all and what normally happens when they</text>
  <text start="503.669" dur="4.59">raise these rates companies look at it</text>
  <text start="506.519" dur="3.12">and say just like McDonald&amp;#39;s and all the</text>
  <text start="508.259" dur="4.5">rest say you know something we can</text>
  <text start="509.639" dur="6.81">replace these individuals with computer</text>
  <text start="512.759" dur="5.22">terminals with robots because we can see</text>
  <text start="516.449" dur="3.39">right now the costs have reached a</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="4.47">certain level where we can make a</text>
  <text start="519.839" dur="4.5">decision pay this individual will</text>
  <text start="522.449" dur="5.64">replace it with a robot who will never</text>
  <text start="524.339" dur="6.901">ask for an hourly wage increase and</text>
  <text start="528.089" dur="5.94">again the only reason you need an hourly</text>
  <text start="531.24" dur="5.219">wage increase is because the value of</text>
  <text start="534.029" dur="5.16">the dollar is continually decreasing</text>
  <text start="536.459" dur="6.48">which makes the cost of living higher</text>
  <text start="539.189" dur="6.87">and why is this happening well it all</text>
  <text start="542.939" dur="6.061">points back to the central bank now</text>
  <text start="546.059" dur="5.7">pending home sales they have surged to</text>
  <text start="549" dur="4.649">the most since 2010 now we know what</text>
  <text start="551.759" dur="4.411">happens with pending home sales a lot of</text>
  <text start="553.649" dur="4.38">people you know put up some maybe a</text>
  <text start="556.17" dur="4.05">deposit on a home or write up a contract</text>
  <text start="558.029" dur="3.03">and most of these are completely</text>
  <text start="560.22" dur="3.21">canceled</text>
  <text start="561.059" dur="5.25">we know that existing home sales well</text>
  <text start="563.43" dur="5.25">those have declined new home sales while</text>
  <text start="566.309" dur="4.89">those shut up why again</text>
  <text start="568.68" dur="5.49">manipulation and we can see right now as</text>
  <text start="571.199" dur="4.531">we move forward these pending home sales</text>
  <text start="574.17" dur="3.719">will start to fall apart</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;ll revise the numbers and when you</text>
  <text start="577.889" dur="4.861">really look at pending home sales</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="6.39">year-over-year we see that they have</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="5.73">actually fallen by 2.4 percent and when</text>
  <text start="585.87" dur="6">you look at the graph going from late</text>
  <text start="588.48" dur="6.87">2015 all the way to 2017 it hovers</text>
  <text start="591.87" dur="6.12">around say zero and it hasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="595.35" dur="4.98">moved from there because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="597.99" dur="4.35">basically yes pending home sales have</text>
  <text start="600.33" dur="4.17">increased revised the numbers these</text>
  <text start="602.34" dur="3.45">contracts have been cancelled it drops</text>
  <text start="604.5" dur="3.24">to a negative number</text>
  <text start="605.79" dur="4.05">yes pending home sales increased and</text>
  <text start="607.74" dur="4.38">then again it goes to a negative number</text>
  <text start="609.84" dur="6.33">and this continually went on since the</text>
  <text start="612.12" dur="5.55">late 2015 so this is a poor reading to</text>
  <text start="616.17" dur="3.3">show us what&amp;#39;s really going on and when</text>
  <text start="617.67" dur="4.38">you really look at it nothing has been</text>
  <text start="619.47" dur="4.98">happening it&amp;#39;s flatline right now now</text>
  <text start="622.05" dur="5.64">there&amp;#39;s a lot of talk about Obamacare</text>
  <text start="624.45" dur="5.22">and how this is going to explode now we</text>
  <text start="627.69" dur="2.97">see the whole thing deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="629.67" dur="3.39">very quickly</text>
  <text start="630.66" dur="4.26">now the Atlanta journal-constitution</text>
  <text start="633.06" dur="4.59">pointed out that the Trump</text>
  <text start="634.92" dur="4.08">administration has until May 22nd to</text>
  <text start="637.65" dur="3.3">decide whether they will continue to</text>
  <text start="639" dur="4.14">pursue the the Obama administration&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="640.95" dur="4.5">appeal to provide subsidies to insurance</text>
  <text start="643.14" dur="5.22">who participate in the federal exchanges</text>
  <text start="645.45" dur="5.37">of course any decision to remove those</text>
  <text start="648.36" dur="5.13">subsidies would likely result in yet</text>
  <text start="650.82" dur="6.63">another massive round of premium hikes</text>
  <text start="653.49" dur="7.47">and further withdrawals from the already</text>
  <text start="657.45" dur="6.48">crippled health insurance program known</text>
  <text start="660.96" dur="5.67">as the Affordable Care Act and we can</text>
  <text start="663.93" dur="6.35">see that this whole entire health care</text>
  <text start="666.63" dur="5.94">system can implode on itself very easily</text>
  <text start="670.28" dur="4.57">without these individuals getting the</text>
  <text start="672.57" dur="6">subsidies the whole thing is a complete</text>
  <text start="674.85" dur="6.81">disaster and it wouldn&amp;#39;t survive this</text>
  <text start="678.57" dur="6.12">collapse Obamacare would be doomed</text>
  <text start="681.66" dur="4.47">now Trump might be pushing for this and</text>
  <text start="684.69" dur="3.81">he might be trying to say okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.13" dur="4.05">just get rid of it this way it it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="688.5" dur="3.24">possibility now something very</text>
  <text start="690.18" dur="4.98">interesting about Obamacare we know</text>
  <text start="691.74" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s a penalty there&amp;#39;s a tax on those</text>
  <text start="695.16" dur="3.03">individuals who decide you know</text>
  <text start="696.87" dur="3.51">something I just can&amp;#39;t afford this I</text>
  <text start="698.19" dur="3.39">cannot afford fifteen hundred eighteen</text>
  <text start="700.38" dur="3.6">hundred twenty two hundred dollars a</text>
  <text start="701.58" dur="4.47">month and then pay for a deductible</text>
  <text start="703.98" dur="6.51">I just don&amp;#39;t make enough money to do</text>
  <text start="706.05" dur="7.65">that so we can see from 2016 six point</text>
  <text start="710.49" dur="6.15">five million taxpayers paid three</text>
  <text start="713.7" dur="5.31">billion in Obamacare penalties for</text>
  <text start="716.64" dur="4.44">not help having health insurance now if</text>
  <text start="719.01" dur="4.89">you notice the news never talks about</text>
  <text start="721.08" dur="6.27">this that there are 6.5 million who</text>
  <text start="723.9" dur="5.28">can&amp;#39;t or it&amp;#39;s impossible for them to get</text>
  <text start="727.35" dur="3.57">health insurance and people say well</text>
  <text start="729.18" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re paying the penalties will the</text>
  <text start="730.92" dur="4.26">penalties range anywhere from three</text>
  <text start="732.75" dur="3.75">hundred to eight hundred depending on</text>
  <text start="735.18" dur="4.38">your income and things like that</text>
  <text start="736.5" dur="4.89">compared to fifteen or even a thousand</text>
  <text start="739.56" dur="4.14">let&amp;#39;s say even eight hundred every</text>
  <text start="741.39" dur="4.26">single month so you can see why they</text>
  <text start="743.7" dur="3.78">chose the penalties because it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="745.65" dur="3.99">not affordable even though it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="747.48" dur="4.83">the Affordable Care Act but the news</text>
  <text start="749.64" dur="4.62">never mentions oh wait we have about 6.4</text>
  <text start="752.31" dur="3.48">million people who don&amp;#39;t have health</text>
  <text start="754.26" dur="3.42">insurance they only talk about that 20</text>
  <text start="755.79" dur="3.78">million number and we broke that number</text>
  <text start="757.68" dur="3.69">down again to show you that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="759.57" dur="4.71">really twenty million people that Obama</text>
  <text start="761.37" dur="4.8">helped it&amp;#39;s really much much lower than</text>
  <text start="764.28" dur="3.36">that because some people already had</text>
  <text start="766.17" dur="3.54">health insurance people already had</text>
  <text start="767.64" dur="3.93">Medicaid and of course you had those</text>
  <text start="769.71" dur="2.97">people who came on because the</text>
  <text start="771.57" dur="3.39">government pays for their health</text>
  <text start="772.68" dur="4.08">insurance through subsidies so when you</text>
  <text start="774.96" dur="4.77">look at the numbers it&amp;#39;s not exactly</text>
  <text start="776.76" dur="6.9">what they&amp;#39;re saying now Deutsche Bank is</text>
  <text start="779.73" dur="5.1">putting odds on if the government is</text>
  <text start="783.66" dur="4.38">going to shut down because of that</text>
  <text start="784.83" dur="5.58">ceiling and Deutsche Bank&amp;#39;s Washington</text>
  <text start="788.04" dur="4.11">expert Frank Kelly estimates the</text>
  <text start="790.41" dur="4.5">probability of government shutdown at</text>
  <text start="792.15" dur="4.77">roughly 40 percent and notes that the</text>
  <text start="794.91" dur="4.32">next two weeks will be a critical will</text>
  <text start="796.92" dur="4.17">be critical to watch and we can see</text>
  <text start="799.23" dur="4.35">already that things are getting closer</text>
  <text start="801.09" dur="4.61">and April 28th or so this is when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="803.58" dur="5.73">gonna hit about 20 trillion dollars now</text>
  <text start="805.7" dur="6.04">the Fed presidents two of the Fed</text>
  <text start="809.31" dur="4.26">presidents they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="811.74" dur="4.16">markets are warm and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="813.57" dur="5.94">frothy this is why I put the title</text>
  <text start="815.9" dur="5.77">operation frothy and saying that because</text>
  <text start="819.51" dur="3.63">of this markets might come down and</text>
  <text start="821.67" dur="4.97">they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="823.14" dur="6.75">to increase the Fed rate multiple times</text>
  <text start="826.64" dur="7.39">during this year and I just want to go</text>
  <text start="829.89" dur="8.55">back a little bit in time to show you</text>
  <text start="834.03" dur="6.3">what the Fed does remember back in 2006</text>
  <text start="838.44" dur="3.96">that was Ben Bernanke when he was a Fed</text>
  <text start="840.33" dur="6.09">chair during that time period going</text>
  <text start="842.4" dur="6.27">through to 2007 they were raising the</text>
  <text start="846.42" dur="3.109">interest rates during this period of</text>
  <text start="848.67" dur="4.279">time</text>
  <text start="849.529" dur="6.75">to cool the housing mark so they raised</text>
  <text start="852.949" dur="6.24">the rates in January to 4.5% this is in</text>
  <text start="856.279" dur="4.35">2006 then he did it a March May and June</text>
  <text start="859.189" dur="5.911">all the way up to five and a quarter</text>
  <text start="860.629" dur="6.12">come 2007 well they kept the rates at</text>
  <text start="865.1" dur="4.409">five and a quarter and then they</text>
  <text start="866.749" dur="5.34">realized that home sales started to fall</text>
  <text start="869.509" dur="4.95">and things were getting a little shaky</text>
  <text start="872.089" dur="4.951">and they realized at this point that</text>
  <text start="874.459" dur="4.92">things weren&amp;#39;t going as well now was</text>
  <text start="877.04" dur="4.169">this planned most likely they knew the</text>
  <text start="879.379" dur="3.421">system how to come down remember they</text>
  <text start="881.209" dur="3.091">just don&amp;#39;t drop it automatically and</text>
  <text start="882.8" dur="3.899">they don&amp;#39;t want you to know they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="884.3" dur="5.399">ones who are doing it so come September</text>
  <text start="886.699" dur="5.58">18th of 2007 they started to lower the</text>
  <text start="889.699" dur="5.76">rate four point seven five four point</text>
  <text start="892.279" dur="5.641">five in December of 2007 four point two</text>
  <text start="895.459" dur="4.05">five and they kept going January but it</text>
  <text start="897.92" dur="3.69">was too late already they already</text>
  <text start="899.509" dur="6.151">started a chain reaction during this</text>
  <text start="901.61" dur="5.82">period so January of 2008 they load the</text>
  <text start="905.66" dur="3.839">three point five and then January 30th</text>
  <text start="907.43" dur="5.55">of the same month they lowered to three</text>
  <text start="909.499" dur="5.911">then March two point two five April two</text>
  <text start="912.98" dur="5.57">percent so they kept lowering it trying</text>
  <text start="915.41" dur="6.779">to stop what was coming here we are in</text>
  <text start="918.55" dur="6.279">2017 they raised it in 2016 they raised</text>
  <text start="922.189" dur="3.991">it in 2017 they&amp;#39;re gonna be raising it</text>
  <text start="924.829" dur="3.93">again and they want to do it like</text>
  <text start="926.18" dur="6.389">another three times which shows you</text>
  <text start="928.759" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re preparing to bring the system</text>
  <text start="932.569" dur="7.651">down because when they started this they</text>
  <text start="935.629" dur="6.75">noticed back in 2007 around September or</text>
  <text start="940.22" dur="4.349">so when they started lower the rate that</text>
  <text start="942.379" dur="4.95">things were rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="944.569" dur="4.74">and of course when we hit 2008 in March</text>
  <text start="947.329" dur="4.141">well they started bringing it down quite</text>
  <text start="949.309" dur="4.53">fast because Bear Stearns was failing</text>
  <text start="951.47" dur="3.869">Lehman was failing a lot of things were</text>
  <text start="953.839" dur="3.211">going on at the point in time but of</text>
  <text start="955.339" dur="4.021">course nobody let you know about this</text>
  <text start="957.05" dur="4.289">and we can see right now here they are</text>
  <text start="959.36" dur="3.69">telling us the market is too frothy</text>
  <text start="961.339" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re telling us they have to raise</text>
  <text start="963.05" dur="4.68">the rates and we could see what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="965.839" dur="3.391">to happen it&amp;#39;s going to start a chain</text>
  <text start="967.73" dur="1.979">reaction remember they&amp;#39;re raising it</text>
  <text start="969.23" dur="2.76">this time</text>
  <text start="969.709" dur="4.8">into a very weak economy actually the</text>
  <text start="971.99" dur="4.709">economy is one gigantic illusion and as</text>
  <text start="974.509" dur="3.45">they raise the rates of course what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="976.699" dur="3.51">going to happen is they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="977.959" dur="5.191">ok things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="980.209" dur="5.311">we&amp;#39;re gonna see how sales slow again go</text>
  <text start="983.15" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s gonna slow just like it did back</text>
  <text start="985.52" dur="4.56">in 2007 sales are gonna come to a</text>
  <text start="988.46" dur="3.63">screeching halt prices are gonna start</text>
  <text start="990.08" dur="3.21">to fall a lot of people are gonna be out</text>
  <text start="992.09" dur="4.7">of the market they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="993.29" dur="6.42">afford homes the markets gonna start to</text>
  <text start="996.79" dur="6.04">fluctuate quite a bit it&amp;#39;s gonna start</text>
  <text start="999.71" dur="5.16">coming down quite a bit and all of a</text>
  <text start="1002.83" dur="3.9">sudden when they hit that point in time</text>
  <text start="1004.87" dur="4.47">and the chain reaction is going they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1006.73" dur="5.73">gonna start decreasing the interest</text>
  <text start="1009.34" dur="5.58">rates just like they did back in 2007</text>
  <text start="1012.46" dur="4.62">going into 2008 and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1014.92" dur="4.2">the process has started already because</text>
  <text start="1017.08" dur="4.14">they already started the process because</text>
  <text start="1019.12" dur="3.57">they know what will trigger the market</text>
  <text start="1021.22" dur="3.42">to come down they know what will trigger</text>
  <text start="1022.69" dur="6.18">the housing market to come down we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1024.64" dur="5.91">following the same exact path so you</text>
  <text start="1028.87" dur="2.94">know what you need to do you need to get</text>
  <text start="1030.55" dur="3.09">prepared because they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="1031.81" dur="4.62">signaling they&amp;#39;re already telling you</text>
  <text start="1033.64" dur="4.44">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now and back</text>
  <text start="1036.43" dur="4.92">then if you want to go back in time to</text>
  <text start="1038.08" dur="6.66">2006 well they had to raise the interest</text>
  <text start="1041.35" dur="6.15">rates to cool the housing market that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1044.74" dur="5.67">what they said back then now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1047.5" dur="6.39">raising the interest rates to calm the</text>
  <text start="1050.41" dur="5.82">markets down and of course by the time</text>
  <text start="1053.89" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re finished everyone will forget</text>
  <text start="1056.23" dur="4.35">what they&amp;#39;ve done and all they will see</text>
  <text start="1058.36" dur="3.66">is the entire economy falling apart now</text>
  <text start="1060.58" dur="3.45">of course they&amp;#39;re gonna lay blame</text>
  <text start="1062.02" dur="3.48">probably the Trump most like you maybe</text>
  <text start="1064.03" dur="4.14">to someone else or another group or</text>
  <text start="1065.5" dur="5.58">country but the blame will always be</text>
  <text start="1068.17" dur="6.36">shifted away from them so we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="1071.08" dur="6.33">in that process the economy is already</text>
  <text start="1074.53" dur="5.49">set to come down they&amp;#39;ve already made</text>
  <text start="1077.41" dur="4.23">the decision and they&amp;#39;re not going back</text>
