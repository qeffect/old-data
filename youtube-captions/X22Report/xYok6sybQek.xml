  <text start="53.06" dur="4.92">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.57" dur="4.77">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.98" dur="6.39">episode 1400 5a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.34" dur="5.4">October 19th 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="64.37" dur="4.77">episode is the economic indicators are</text>
  <text start="66.74" dur="5.7">piling up and they are pointing towards</text>
  <text start="69.14" dur="5.88">a collapse let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.44" dur="4.5">collapse financial news now we have been</text>
  <text start="75.02" dur="4.11">tracking and following all these</text>
  <text start="76.94" dur="4.95">different indicators and a lot of these</text>
  <text start="79.13" dur="5.64">indicators yes they&amp;#39;re pointing to bad</text>
  <text start="81.89" dur="5.07">times ahead and we are getting more and</text>
  <text start="84.77" dur="4.56">more of these indicators and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="86.96" dur="4.05">piling up so when we start to look at</text>
  <text start="89.33" dur="3.48">all this stuff we&amp;#39;re starting to scratch</text>
  <text start="91.01" dur="4.89">our heads we&amp;#39;re starting to wonder what</text>
  <text start="92.81" dur="6.6">is going on here now we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="95.9" dur="6.93">UK retail sales they have slumped now</text>
  <text start="99.41" dur="5.61">they fell by 0.8 percent last month and</text>
  <text start="102.83" dur="5.22">it looks like the buying power of</text>
  <text start="105.02" dur="6.15">Britain&amp;#39;s well it&amp;#39;s being eroded away by</text>
  <text start="108.05" dur="5.16">inflation the UK third quarter retail</text>
  <text start="111.17" dur="7.71">sales growth is the weakest in four</text>
  <text start="113.21" dur="8.28">years as inflation hits the U K here in</text>
  <text start="118.88" dur="4.68">the United States we are seeing that the</text>
  <text start="121.49" dur="5.64">initial jobless claims they have crashed</text>
  <text start="123.56" dur="8.46">to the lowest level since 1973 so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="127.13" dur="6.24">back to 1973 initial jobless claims now</text>
  <text start="132.02" dur="3.78">let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="5.01">because we&amp;#39;ve seen this pattern before</text>
  <text start="135.8" dur="5.13">and we can go all the way back to the</text>
  <text start="138.38" dur="5.04">70s and the pattern seems to be the same</text>
  <text start="140.93" dur="5.49">every time initial jobless claims Falls</text>
  <text start="143.42" dur="5.97">and it continually Falls and reaches a</text>
  <text start="146.42" dur="5.58">certain point all of a sudden we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="149.39" dur="4.35">recession now this is one of the lowest</text>
  <text start="152" dur="4.5">points that we have seen because even if</text>
  <text start="153.74" dur="6.06">we go back to 2008 we can see that we</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="8.18">were down pretty darn low for initial</text>
  <text start="159.8" dur="4.88">jobless claims and we were even with</text>
  <text start="164.98" dur="5.71">1979-1989 type of area but this right</text>
  <text start="168.5" dur="4.29">now we&amp;#39;re going all the way back to the</text>
  <text start="170.69" dur="5.46">beginning when we pretty much came off</text>
  <text start="172.79" dur="5.55">what oh yes a gold standard so they are</text>
  <text start="176.15" dur="4.38">really pushing this to make us believe</text>
  <text start="178.34" dur="3.84">that everything is fine everything is</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="3.69">great and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="4.32">this is not what it&amp;#39;s really turning out</text>
  <text start="184.22" dur="5.91">to be we&amp;#39;re looking at these patterns</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="6.09">and if we go back to all the different</text>
  <text start="190.13" dur="4.17">years we can see that every time we were</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="4.44">in a recession the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="194.3" dur="4.44">claims they hit a very very low point</text>
  <text start="197.03" dur="3.33">and then they shot up afterwards and</text>
  <text start="198.74" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing a lot of these</text>
  <text start="200.36" dur="5.07">indicators showing the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="202.49" dur="6.39">we also see there we have mmmm many many</text>
  <text start="205.43" dur="5.43">problems in the pension arena and the</text>
  <text start="208.88" dur="4.079">state of Illinois well they&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="4.62">point of no return right now and it</text>
  <text start="212.959" dur="5.961">looks like it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="215.48" dur="5.79">and what we&amp;#39;re looking at right now is</text>
  <text start="218.92" dur="4.02">Illinois is gonna have to raise taxes</text>
  <text start="221.27" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to cut spending and</text>
  <text start="222.94" dur="4.15">we could see that they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="225.26" dur="4.83">be able to pay these pensions out</text>
  <text start="227.09" dur="5.13">because they are in the hole by billions</text>
  <text start="230.09" dur="5.01">and billions of dollars and this is</text>
  <text start="232.22" dur="5.55">going to be a huge problem for Illinois</text>
  <text start="235.1" dur="4.53">and not just Illinois&amp;#39;s but for many of</text>
  <text start="237.77" dur="3.51">the states out there it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="239.63" dur="3.69">absolutely awful and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="241.28" dur="3.81">following the pension problems and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.32" dur="3.81">not improving it&amp;#39;s actually getting</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="4.95">worse remember these pension programs</text>
  <text start="247.13" dur="4.77">they were looking for you know six seven</text>
  <text start="250.04" dur="5.1">eight percent return this is what their</text>
  <text start="251.9" dur="6.149">programs were structured around since</text>
  <text start="255.14" dur="5.25">interest rates have been so low they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.049" dur="5.761">not reaching this at all and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.39" dur="6.24">running into problems right now and we</text>
  <text start="263.81" dur="4.14">see that the entire economy when we look</text>
  <text start="266.63" dur="3.27">at housing we know our housing the</text>
  <text start="267.95" dur="4.16">existing home sales we know the new</text>
  <text start="269.9" dur="5.07">building permits new construction and</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="4.78">new home sales that has all been</text>
  <text start="274.97" dur="4.62">declining retail we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="276.89" dur="6.99">exact thing that has been declining and</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="7.079">when we look at GDP GDP is completely</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="4.56">fake phony and false and this is coming</text>
  <text start="286.669" dur="5.041">out of Charles Hugh Smith where he</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="6.479">points to this individual Dave where he</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="9.269">looked at the GDP and said listen basic</text>
  <text start="294.919" dur="8.25">math shows us that GDP is calculated to</text>
  <text start="300.979" dur="5.311">keep us in the dark</text>
  <text start="303.169" dur="6.901">now let me just read what is written</text>
  <text start="306.29" dur="6.18">here the rot eating away at our society</text>
  <text start="310.07" dur="4.82">and economy is typically papered over</text>
  <text start="312.47" dur="4.77">with bogus statistics that prove</text>
  <text start="314.89" dur="4.97">everything&amp;#39;s getting better every day in</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="5.35">every way the prime proof of rising</text>
  <text start="319.86" dur="5.489">prosperity is the gross domestic product</text>
  <text start="322.59" dur="4.879">so if we borrow money to pay people to</text>
  <text start="325.349" dur="5.761">dig holes and then fill them with</text>
  <text start="327.469" dur="7.51">excavated dirt GDP Rises - general</text>
  <text start="331.11" dur="7.399">applause the debt we took on to fund the</text>
  <text start="334.979" dur="6.84">make work is an accounted for at all</text>
  <text start="338.509" dur="4.09">longtime correspondent David P of Market</text>
  <text start="341.819" dur="3.87">daily briefing</text>
  <text start="342.599" dur="6.481">recently summarized the key flaw in GDP</text>
  <text start="345.689" dur="7.141">GDP doesn&amp;#39;t reflect changes in the</text>
  <text start="349.08" dur="6.72">balance sheet ie the debt now here&amp;#39;s his</text>
  <text start="352.83" dur="5.429">explanation once I learned about</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="5.25">accounting I figured out why the GDP</text>
  <text start="358.259" dur="5.851">metric was insufficient what is missing</text>
  <text start="361.05" dur="4.859">the balance sheet hurricanes are a</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="4.38">direct hit to your nation&amp;#39;s balance</text>
  <text start="365.909" dur="4.47">sheet the national income statement goes</text>
  <text start="368.49" dur="4.26">up because of increased spending to</text>
  <text start="370.379" dur="4.32">replace loss assets but the equity part</text>
  <text start="372.75" dur="4.259">of the national balance sheet ends up</text>
  <text start="374.699" dur="5.071">taking a hit in direct proportion to the</text>
  <text start="377.009" dur="5.101">damage that occurred even if you rebuild</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="4.29">everything just the way it was your</text>
  <text start="382.11" dur="5.309">assets remain the same while your</text>
  <text start="384.06" dur="4.74">liabilities have increased we know this</text>
  <text start="387.419" dur="3.87">because we use the balance sheet</text>
  <text start="388.8" dur="4.739">equation equity equals assets minus</text>
  <text start="391.289" dur="5.011">liabilities equity is another word for</text>
  <text start="393.539" dur="6.66">wealth so before the hurricane we have</text>
  <text start="396.3" dur="6.929">wealth equals house plus car - home debt</text>
  <text start="400.199" dur="6.601">plus car debt after hurricane we have</text>
  <text start="403.229" dur="8.09">wealth equals house plus car minus 2</text>
  <text start="406.8" dur="7.859">times home debt plus 2 times car debt</text>
  <text start="411.319" dur="8.051">wealth equity has declined by the sum</text>
  <text start="414.659" dur="7.26">home debt plus car debt so when we look</text>
  <text start="419.37" dur="4.889">at the GDP numbers and we see the GDP</text>
  <text start="421.919" dur="4.231">numbers we could see that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="424.259" dur="5.46">calculated correctly and they have done</text>
  <text start="426.15" dur="6.03">this for a very long time to make it</text>
  <text start="429.719" dur="4.681">seem like everything is fine they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="432.18" dur="5.72">look at the liability section they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="434.4" dur="7.859">also included research and development</text>
  <text start="437.9" dur="6.609">they&amp;#39;ve also included other aspects to</text>
  <text start="442.259" dur="4.65">GDP that revise the numbers and when you</text>
  <text start="444.509" dur="4.291">put all of this together you could see</text>
  <text start="446.909" dur="5.43">we have a major problem</text>
  <text start="448.8" dur="4.89">GDP right now is not at 2% it&amp;#39;s not at</text>
  <text start="452.339" dur="4.471">2.3 percent as</text>
  <text start="453.69" dur="7.23">at 2.5% it&amp;#39;s in the negative rain if we</text>
  <text start="456.81" dur="7.17">go to shadow stats where John is looking</text>
  <text start="460.92" dur="4.83">at the numbers he&amp;#39;s calculating the GDP</text>
  <text start="463.98" dur="3.3">the way it used to be calculated and we</text>
  <text start="465.75" dur="3.74">are in the negative territory this is</text>
  <text start="467.28" dur="4.29">before it was all manipulated and</text>
  <text start="469.49" dur="4.12">basically what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing is I</text>
  <text start="471.57" dur="3.39">mean if we look at all the statistical</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="1.92">numbers that the government and the feds</text>
  <text start="474.96" dur="2.7">throw at us</text>
  <text start="475.53" dur="5.52">throw throw at us we see that</text>
  <text start="477.66" dur="7.35">unemployment completely manipulated we</text>
  <text start="481.05" dur="7.5">see that GDP completely manipulated they</text>
  <text start="485.01" dur="6.9">manipulate the retail sales remember the</text>
  <text start="488.55" dur="6.18">retail sales are estimates this is not</text>
  <text start="491.91" dur="5.4">the numbers from the actual stores and</text>
  <text start="494.73" dur="5.25">if a store closes down they take it and</text>
  <text start="497.31" dur="6.75">they you know basically spread it out</text>
  <text start="499.98" dur="6.63">over a year the automobile industry they</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="4.58">use channel stuffing and every time cars</text>
  <text start="506.61" dur="5.73">are delivered to the lot that is</text>
  <text start="508.64" dur="5.86">considered a sale so when you start to</text>
  <text start="512.34" dur="3.66">look at all these different things you</text>
  <text start="514.5" dur="3.36">start to scratch your head and you start</text>
  <text start="516" dur="4.2">to wonder what is going on here</text>
  <text start="517.86" dur="4.98">I mean why aren&amp;#39;t they telling us the</text>
  <text start="520.2" dur="4.62">truth something is wrong</text>
  <text start="522.84" dur="4.71">the reason they can&amp;#39;t tell us the truth</text>
  <text start="524.82" dur="7.02">is because if they told us the truth the</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="6.12">economy is done for remember what they</text>
  <text start="531.84" dur="3.75">had to do to make us believe that the</text>
  <text start="533.67" dur="4.01">economy is doing well is they had to</text>
  <text start="535.59" dur="4.32">manipulate all these numbers and</text>
  <text start="537.68" dur="5.41">manipulate the stock market keep</text>
  <text start="539.91" dur="5.82">precious metals very low by doing this</text>
  <text start="543.09" dur="4.56">you can convince anyone that the</text>
  <text start="545.73" dur="4.47">economy&amp;#39;s doing well companies do this</text>
  <text start="547.65" dur="5.25">also they manipulate their books they</text>
  <text start="550.2" dur="4.17">manipulate their information and they</text>
  <text start="552.9" dur="3.75">can keep it going for quite a while and</text>
  <text start="554.37" dur="5.07">run did this in the past and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="556.65" dur="4.71">kept it going Bernie Madoff did this</text>
  <text start="559.44" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s a Ponzi scheme and they can do it</text>
  <text start="561.36" dur="3.03">and everyone thinks wow their business</text>
  <text start="562.86" dur="3.36">is incredible I got to get involved in</text>
  <text start="564.39" dur="3.72">that it&amp;#39;s all on the up-and-up because</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="3.69">look I saw the numbers everything looks</text>
  <text start="568.11" dur="4.08">great but you don&amp;#39;t know there&amp;#39;s tricky</text>
  <text start="569.91" dur="4.29">accounting behind the scenes and then</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="5.25">eventually what happens is this tricky</text>
  <text start="574.2" dur="5.46">count accounting rears its ugly head and</text>
  <text start="577.44" dur="3.66">people start to scratch their heads and</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="3.69">start to say okay something&amp;#39;s wrong here</text>
  <text start="581.1" dur="3.3">something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense the same</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="2.85">thing happened with the subprime</text>
  <text start="584.4" dur="2.94">securities they rated everything</text>
  <text start="586.2" dur="3.12">triple-a</text>
  <text start="587.34" dur="4.53">people started to look into things and</text>
  <text start="589.32" dur="5.22">things do not make sense now Robert</text>
  <text start="591.87" dur="6.36">Shiller is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="594.54" dur="5.91">that we might have a stock market panic</text>
  <text start="598.23" dur="4.53">like 1987</text>
  <text start="600.45" dur="4.32">it could happen once again there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="602.76" dur="5.25">something that might stop it though</text>
  <text start="604.77" dur="5.81">because after 1987 they did something</text>
  <text start="608.01" dur="5.79">they put in what&amp;#39;s called a kill switch</text>
  <text start="610.58" dur="5.41">the New York Stock Exchange instituted a</text>
  <text start="613.8" dur="5.43">rule 80 B which is a circuit breaker</text>
  <text start="615.99" dur="5.52">they did this to the S&amp;amp;P 500 they did it</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="5.46">to the Nasdaq they did to the bad system</text>
  <text start="621.51" dur="6.36">and what they can do right now if the</text>
  <text start="624.69" dur="4.89">market Falls by 20% or so they can throw</text>
  <text start="627.87" dur="5.03">the circuit breaker and shut everything</text>
  <text start="629.58" dur="5.73">down and they can stop everything and</text>
  <text start="632.9" dur="3.55">they&amp;#39;re saying if they do this they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="635.31" dur="2.79">be able to save it they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="636.45" dur="3.36">rework things and everything could be</text>
  <text start="638.1" dur="3.66">saved this is what they hope for and</text>
  <text start="639.81" dur="3.12">they did this on purpose because they</text>
  <text start="641.76" dur="3.24">know when the market starts to come down</text>
  <text start="642.93" dur="3.69">each one of the markets is going to come</text>
  <text start="645" dur="2.79">down and they&amp;#39;re gonna have to throw all</text>
  <text start="646.62" dur="3.9">the kill switches at once</text>
  <text start="647.79" dur="5.22">now when they open up again it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="650.52" dur="5.85">to get better while they did this during</text>
  <text start="653.01" dur="6.75">the 1929 crash where they you know</text>
  <text start="656.37" dur="6.72">closed everything down and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="659.76" dur="5.55">reopen but when they did everything got</text>
  <text start="663.09" dur="3.54">a lot worse and they could stop it again</text>
  <text start="665.31" dur="3.24">they can throw it like if they see it go</text>
  <text start="666.63" dur="3.48">down 5% they could hit the circuit</text>
