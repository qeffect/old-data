  <text start="183.549" dur="4.05">economy is recovering but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="185.62" dur="5.94">really seeing and what is the reality</text>
  <text start="187.599" dur="6.661">the reality is there is no recovery all</text>
  <text start="191.56" dur="5.61">these people are having a tough time</text>
  <text start="194.26" dur="5.819">making ends meet they&amp;#39;re not bringing in</text>

  <text start="210.79" dur="4.919">same exact thing of I that I has always</text>
  <text start="212.949" dur="4.41">been saying is that every time the</text>
  <text start="215.709" dur="3.721">government tells you something it is</text>
  <text start="217.359" dur="3.361">always the opposite if they tell you</text>
  <text start="219.43" dur="3.449">they didn&amp;#39;t know about something they</text>
  <text start="220.72" dur="4.53">actually did if they tell you were in a</text>
  <text start="222.879" dur="5.01">recovery we&amp;#39;re headed for disaster and</text>
  <text start="225.25" dur="4.68">if you look at the track record of the</text>
  <text start="227.889" dur="3.69">government it is always the same and not</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="3.75">just the United States government I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="231.579" dur="4.921">talking about any government around the</text>
  <text start="233.68" dur="4.41">world it is normally always the same now</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="3.84">here in the United States what are we</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="4.739">seeing here well we are seeing that</text>

  <text start="242.829" dur="4.141">in five months and more people now</text>
  <text start="245.56" dur="3.84">because the lay also starting to take</text>
  <text start="246.97" dur="5.549">effect and we&amp;#39;re seeing more people are</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="4.829">applying for unemployment and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.519" dur="2.97">seeing seeing this start to rise now of</text>
  <text start="254.229" dur="3.091">course last month there were like oh</text>
  <text start="255.489" dur="4.17">look we&amp;#39;re in this recovery we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="257.32" dur="4.8">starting to rebound and again you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="259.659" dur="4.651">go bye week you know each week or each</text>
  <text start="262.12" dur="4.079">month that we&amp;#39;re looking at you have to</text>
  <text start="264.31" dur="4.289">take it over a long stretch of time and</text>
  <text start="266.199" dur="5.431">if we go back over time we can see</text>
  <text start="268.599" dur="5.551">they&amp;#39;re fake unemployment numbers don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="4.38">even make sense for what is happening</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="3.87">in the economy because when we look at</text>
  <text start="276.01" dur="4.74">the economy we see real estate</text>
  <text start="278.02" dur="6.69">completely imploding retail imploding we</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="6.29">see people are being laid off left and</text>
  <text start="284.71" dur="5.7">right and these unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="287.04" dur="5.98">make no sense whatsoever they are</text>
  <text start="290.41" dur="4.23">completely useless right now and when we</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="3.54">look at the job situation we have to</text>
  <text start="294.64" dur="4.8">remember how they calculate all this all</text>
  <text start="296.56" dur="5.49">those people who have not been on an</text>
  <text start="299.44" dur="6.36">interview in the last like four weeks or</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="6.15">so they are not included in unemployment</text>
  <text start="305.8" dur="5.58">if you are continually sending out</text>
  <text start="308.2" dur="5.22">resumes or looking for a job or going to</text>
  <text start="311.38" dur="4.14">offices and pushing and pushing and</text>
  <text start="313.42" dur="4.32">pushing and trying to get a job you were</text>
  <text start="315.52" dur="4.29">not counted anymore if it&amp;#39;s over a</text>
  <text start="317.74" dur="4.74">certain period of time and there was a</text>
  <text start="319.81" dur="4.53">survey out there saying that a and this</text>
  <text start="322.48" dur="3.12">is a new poll suggests that finding</text>
  <text start="324.34" dur="3.36">employment particularly for the</text>
  <text start="325.6" dur="5.49">long-term unemployed continues to be a</text>
  <text start="327.7" dur="5.07">struggle for Americans forty-seven</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="3.9">percent agree with the statement I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="4.68">completely given up on looking for a job</text>
  <text start="334.99" dur="5.58">sixty percent say looking for work has</text>
  <text start="337.45" dur="4.74">been harder than expected forty-six</text>
  <text start="340.57" dur="3.96">percent of the unemployed respondents</text>
  <text start="342.19" dur="3.99">reported not having had any job</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="4.17">interviews in the prior month and</text>

  <text start="351.94" dur="3.51">five percent of respondents say the</text>
  <text start="353.38" dur="4.5">economy is most responsible for them</text>
  <text start="355.45" dur="3.96">being out of work and I can say from the</text>
  <text start="357.88" dur="3.21">people that I know that have been</text>
  <text start="359.41" dur="4.29">sending out resumes and trying to get</text>
  <text start="361.09" dur="5.7">headhunters and everyone to work for</text>
  <text start="363.7" dur="5.34">them it has been very very difficult to</text>
  <text start="366.79" dur="3.99">get anyone to come back and say listen</text>
  <text start="369.04" dur="3.63">let up we&amp;#39;ll bring you in for an</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="4.62">interview what usually happens is they</text>

  <text start="2612.5" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re seeing is they&amp;#39;re building these</text>
  <text start="2614.329" dur="5.931">towers US troops are in the northern</text>

  <text start="2632.48" dur="7.29">of an event occur someplace in the</text>
  <text start="2635.75" dur="8.04">United States or in Europe and what is</text>
  <text start="2639.77" dur="8.099">very interesting is someone emailed this</text>
  <text start="2643.79" dur="7.02">to me Louis and it&amp;#39;s a Craigslist ad and</text>
  <text start="2647.869" dur="5.601">it says role players for military mock</text>
  <text start="2650.81" dur="4.549">simulated disaster in Atlanta</text>
  <text start="2653.47" dur="4.66">compensation a hundred dollars a day</text>

  <text start="2660.95" dur="4.919">the simulation of mass casualty exercise</text>
  <text start="2663.55" dur="4.87">role players will participate in an</text>

  <text start="2677.15" dur="3.69">for the simulation as a training</text>
  <text start="2678.53" dur="5.25">exercise for the medical units this is</text>
  <text start="2680.84" dur="8.64">going to happen the jun 27th 28th and</text>
  <text start="2683.78" dur="8.9">29th so it looks like this could be an</text>
  <text start="2689.48" dur="7.23">indicator of something happening during</text>
  <text start="2692.68" dur="6.25">the later part of June and it looks like</text>
  <text start="2696.71" dur="3.72">it could be some type of false flag</text>
  <text start="2698.93" dur="4.14">events so we&amp;#39;re going to have to keep an</text>
  <text start="2700.43" dur="4.68">eye on this and we already know today</text>
  <text start="2703.07" dur="4.8">and we&amp;#39;ve seen it all over the net that</text>
  <text start="2705.11" dur="5.91">Tampa was having these black op drills</text>
  <text start="2707.87" dur="5.28">in Tampa flying in helicopters live</text>

  <text start="2720.71" dur="8.34">York and it&amp;#39;s happening all over the</text>
  <text start="2723.56" dur="7.56">place now we understand and this we</text>
  <text start="2729.05" dur="5.7">talked about this quite a bit there was</text>
  <text start="2731.12" dur="7.44">a dry run in California to knock out the</text>
  <text start="2734.75" dur="5.28">power grid in California and of course</text>
  <text start="2738.56" dur="3.15">all the government officials and all the</text>
  <text start="2740.03" dur="4.89">experts are out there saying yes this</text>
  <text start="2741.71" dur="5.31">was a dry run it was military it was</text>
  <text start="2744.92" dur="4.17">like a military op they do exactly what</text>
  <text start="2747.02" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re going to do and then all of a</text>
  <text start="2749.09" dur="4.71">sudden no this was yesterday an advanced</text>
  <text start="2752.06" dur="4.86">group of hackers recently attacked a</text>
  <text start="2753.8" dur="5.25">u.s. public utility compromising its</text>
  <text start="2756.92" dur="3.75">control system network without affecting</text>
  <text start="2759.05" dur="3.78">the utilities operation according to the</text>
  <text start="2760.67" dur="4.23">US Department of Homeland Security so it</text>
  <text start="2762.83" dur="4.62">looks like they&amp;#39;re making little dry</text>
  <text start="2764.9" dur="4.59">runs to make sure they&amp;#39;re able to do</text>
  <text start="2767.45" dur="3.72">what they need to do here DHS said that</text>
  <text start="2769.49" dur="4.5">hacking group may have launched the</text>
  <text start="2771.17" dur="4.65">latest attack via internet portal that</text>
  <text start="2773.99" dur="5.31">allowed workers to access the utilities</text>
  <text start="2775.82" dur="7.05">controls so we have a dry run and now we</text>
  <text start="2779.3" dur="5.91">have a dry run of a cyber attack you</text>
  <text start="2782.87" dur="3.81">think they&amp;#39;re planning something here do</text>
  <text start="2785.21" dur="3.99">you think the power is going to go out</text>
  <text start="2786.68" dur="6.99">and we start putting all this together</text>
  <text start="2789.2" dur="9.75">we have the buildup in Syria we have the</text>
  <text start="2793.67" dur="8.55">opposition is the new government being</text>
  <text start="2798.95" dur="5.64">formed all the embassies for Syria were</text>
  <text start="2802.22" dur="5.61">closed government officials were asked</text>
  <text start="2804.59" dur="5.52">to leave and there&amp;#39;s a drill going on at</text>
  <text start="2807.83" dur="4.26">the same time the elections are going on</text>

  <text start="2822.29" dur="4.74">through the State Department and these</text>
  <text start="2824" dur="6.54">packages are not checked because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2827.03" dur="5.13">exempt from inspection so we can see</text>
