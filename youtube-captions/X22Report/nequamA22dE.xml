  <text start="38.02" dur="4.98">January eighth 2016 and the title the</text>
  <text start="40.66" dur="5.43">episode is US government has been moving</text>
  <text start="43" dur="5.97">all military assets in place to start</text>
  <text start="46.09" dur="5.07">World War three let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="48.97" dur="5.22">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="51.16" dur="8.67">geopolitical news now at this point we</text>
  <text start="54.19" dur="8.16">realize that Obamacare is not put into</text>
  <text start="59.83" dur="4.68">place to help the everyday American I</text>
  <text start="62.35" dur="4.32">mean we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re seeing evidence of this</text>
  <text start="64.51" dur="4.89">where people are complaining their</text>
  <text start="66.67" dur="5.37">premiums are skyrocketing it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="69.4" dur="4.74">affordable the deductibles are very high</text>
  <text start="72.04" dur="4.22">and people are not reaping any of the</text>
  <text start="74.14" dur="6.3">benefits of having health insurance and</text>
  <text start="76.26" dur="6.719">as we know Congress exempted themselves</text>
  <text start="80.44" dur="5.82">from Obama you&amp;#39;re actually the president</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="4.89">exempted exempted himself from Obamacare</text>
  <text start="86.26" dur="4.5">so that should tell you something about</text>
  <text start="87.869" dur="4.811">Obamacare because if something is so</text>
  <text start="90.76" dur="3.69">great and they&amp;#39;re telling you it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="92.68" dur="3.78">great and it&amp;#39;s going to be incredible</text>
  <text start="94.45" dur="4.409">for all of you then it should be</text>
  <text start="96.46" dur="4.92">incredible for them and the question is</text>
  <text start="98.859" dur="4.021">why aren&amp;#39;t they taking it why because</text>
  <text start="101.38" dur="3.809">their health insurance is about a</text>
  <text start="102.88" dur="4.65">hundred times better than what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="105.189" dur="5.46">giving the people so here&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="107.53" dur="4.799">instance of where government is not</text>
  <text start="110.649" dur="5.191">working for the people and you have to</text>
  <text start="112.329" dur="7.29">remember how Obamacare came about this</text>
  <text start="115.84" dur="7.769">legislation was written by the health</text>
  <text start="119.619" dur="6">industry the corporations and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="123.609" dur="4.26">they all got together sitting in a room</text>
  <text start="125.619" dur="5.071">saying hey listen how can we make an</text>
  <text start="127.869" dur="6.061">incredible amount of money and not give</text>
  <text start="130.69" dur="4.35">any benefits to the American people so</text>
  <text start="133.93" dur="2.79">they came up with this plan and they</text>
  <text start="135.04" dur="4.47">said this is what we can do we make it</text>
  <text start="136.72" dur="4.5">mandatory and we make sure that everyone</text>
  <text start="139.51" dur="4.68">can do it but how do we do this how do</text>
  <text start="141.22" dur="4.59">we force everyone into it I&amp;#39;m sure Obama</text>
  <text start="144.19" dur="3.42">raised his hand and said hey listen we</text>
  <text start="145.81" dur="5.97">can put a penalty this way i can bring</text>
  <text start="147.61" dur="7.77">tax revenue into the country to pay off</text>
  <text start="151.78" dur="5.82">this debt or just basically make it so</text>
  <text start="155.38" dur="4.65">we can continually on we can continue on</text>
  <text start="157.6" dur="4.76">with the government and actually i can</text>
  <text start="160.03" dur="4.14">enter what intertwined texts into this</text>
  <text start="162.36" dur="4.66">now we</text>
  <text start="164.17" dur="4.56">no this is coming from much higher we</text>
  <text start="167.02" dur="4.5">know corporations are also involved in</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="4.11">this so basically they set out a plan to</text>
  <text start="171.52" dur="4.53">say this is how we&amp;#39;re going to do it</text>
  <text start="172.84" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re going to set a low premium in the</text>
  <text start="176.05" dur="4.17">beginning will make the deductibles</text>
  <text start="177.97" dur="3.54">really high so this way the insurance</text>
  <text start="180.22" dur="3.269">companies don&amp;#39;t have to pay out and</text>
  <text start="181.51" dur="4.41">slowly but surely since it&amp;#39;s mandatory</text>
  <text start="183.489" dur="5.371">there&amp;#39;s no competition we could just</text>
  <text start="185.92" dur="5.52">raise the premiums and let people argue</text>
  <text start="188.86" dur="3.69">it makes no difference because what are</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="2.78">they gonna argue they can&amp;#39;t go to a</text>
  <text start="192.55" dur="3.39">different company they&amp;#39;re all the same</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="4.57">they&amp;#39;re not going to find anything</text>
  <text start="195.94" dur="4.68">better and if they don&amp;#39;t go in there</text>
  <text start="198.79" dur="5.16">they get hit with the penalty so we</text>
  <text start="200.62" dur="7.08">continually force people into it and we</text>
  <text start="203.95" dur="6.33">can see right now this entire scheme was</text>
  <text start="207.7" dur="5.73">not a benefit to the people whatsoever</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="7.88">and it&amp;#39;s getting worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="7.91">and if Congress the people who are in</text>
  <text start="218.16" dur="5.74">government representing representing us</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="5.89">would have taken the time to read it to</text>
  <text start="223.9" dur="7.07">understand what was going on this would</text>
  <text start="227.23" dur="5.849">never have been passed but of course</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="3.85">they didn&amp;#39;t care about that they&amp;#39;re too</text>
  <text start="233.079" dur="3.841">busy lining their pockets they&amp;#39;re too</text>
  <text start="234.82" dur="4.979">busy about themselves now of course now</text>
  <text start="236.92" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re saying after all this time well</text>
  <text start="239.799" dur="4.831">Obamacare doesn&amp;#39;t work and now we have</text>
  <text start="242.41" dur="4.79">to repeal it so we&amp;#39;re going to give this</text>
  <text start="244.63" dur="5.43">legislation to say look we tried and</text>
  <text start="247.2" dur="4.99">unless they had a veto-proof piece of</text>
  <text start="250.06" dur="3.72">legislation we know what the president</text>
  <text start="252.19" dur="3.329">was going to do and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="253.78" dur="3.81">he did the House of Representative</text>
  <text start="255.519" dur="6.03">passed the legislation send it to the</text>
  <text start="257.59" dur="6.84">president desk the measure passed by 242</text>
  <text start="261.549" dur="7.411">181 but guess what the President did he</text>
  <text start="264.43" dur="6.93">vetoed it I mean seriously was he going</text>
  <text start="268.96" dur="4.44">to do anything else he wasn&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="271.36" dur="4.8">say okay let&amp;#39;s repeal Obamacare we know</text>
  <text start="273.4" dur="6.57">this is completely unconstitutional we</text>
  <text start="276.16" dur="5.79">know the judge was blackmailed because</text>
  <text start="279.97" dur="7.65">as soon as he made his ruling he left</text>
  <text start="281.95" dur="8.939">the country and all of this was to help</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="9.229">corporations to help bring in revenue</text>
  <text start="290.889" dur="5.96">and to tax the people more</text>
  <text start="296.889" dur="8.43">and they provide no benefit whatsoever</text>
  <text start="299.969" dur="8.081">people are suffering because of it now</text>
  <text start="305.319" dur="7.171">Obama now is trying to push as we know</text>
  <text start="308.05" dur="8.16">his gun control and there&amp;#39;s numerous</text>
  <text start="312.49" dur="6.539">polls out there and I saw the video with</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="4.38">the wife of the American sniper where</text>
  <text start="319.029" dur="3.66">she&amp;#39;s saying this is ridiculous that</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="3.659">you&amp;#39;re trying to get the weapons away</text>
  <text start="322.689" dur="3.6">from the everyday person because this is</text>
  <text start="324.249" dur="3.361">not going to help whatsoever actually</text>
  <text start="326.289" dur="4.081">ninety-nine point nine percent of the</text>
  <text start="327.61" dur="5.7">population that has weapons has not</text>
  <text start="330.37" dur="4.59">committed anything and of course it</text>
  <text start="333.31" dur="2.759">would be nice if she mentioned that all</text>
  <text start="334.96" dur="4.56">these things while these mass shootings</text>
  <text start="336.069" dur="6.87">were false flags but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="339.52" dur="7.739">right now is polls are coming out and</text>
  <text start="342.939" dur="8.521">the majority of Americans oppose Obama</text>
  <text start="347.259" dur="6.421">coming in and forcing this new gun</text>
  <text start="351.46" dur="6.389">control on the American people without</text>
  <text start="353.68" dur="6.69">working with Congress and he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="357.849" dur="7.651">allowed to make any laws or anything</text>
  <text start="360.37" dur="9.03">that&amp;#39;s the job of Congress but he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="365.5" dur="6.719">wait for Congress because the powers</text>
  <text start="369.4" dur="6.319">above him are saying get the weapons</text>
  <text start="372.219" dur="7.92">away from the people anyway you can and</text>
  <text start="375.719" dur="6.31">this has been his goal this has been the</text>
  <text start="380.139" dur="5.481">central bankers goal the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.029" dur="7.1">goal we need to control the people and</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="6.19">according to a new Rasmussen report and</text>
  <text start="389.129" dur="5.621">the poll they did of a thousand likely</text>
  <text start="391.81" dur="5.31">us voters fifty-eight percent say the</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="5.46">government should only do what the</text>
  <text start="397.12" dur="4.68">President and Congress agree on when</text>
  <text start="400.21" dur="3.78">they talking about gun control the</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="6.169">president should not be doing it on his</text>
  <text start="403.99" dur="6.69">own which I completely agree and</text>
  <text start="407.969" dur="5.29">Congress right now is not ready to do</text>
  <text start="410.68" dur="7.159">anything they tried with all of these</text>
  <text start="413.259" dur="7.02">false flag mass shootings the hoaxes and</text>
  <text start="417.839" dur="4.48">guess what they couldn&amp;#39;t get traction</text>
  <text start="420.279" dur="7.11">they tried one after another after</text>
  <text start="422.319" dur="7.911">another and it just didn&amp;#39;t work it</text>
  <text start="427.389" dur="5.541">didn&amp;#39;t move and get traction</text>
  <text start="430.23" dur="6.03">and this is why the president is doing</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="6.66">it on his own right now now out in North</text>
  <text start="436.26" dur="6.36">Korea still there is no proof that it</text>
  <text start="439.59" dur="5.55">was a nuclear blast but we see American</text>
  <text start="442.62" dur="5.31">lawmakers they&amp;#39;re calling to bolster the</text>
  <text start="445.14" dur="4.05">US military presence in the Pacific they</text>
  <text start="447.93" dur="6.27">want to increase the investment a</text>
  <text start="449.19" dur="8.88">missile defense and basically all these</text>
  <text start="454.2" dur="5.81">calls for increasing the missile defense</text>
  <text start="458.07" dur="7.08">in the Pacific are coming from</text>
  <text start="460.01" dur="11.8">contractors lobbyists those government</text>
  <text start="465.15" dur="9.38">employees who have contracts or those</text>
  <text start="471.81" dur="5.85">government employees that are getting</text>
  <text start="474.53" dur="6.46">money from these contractors they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="477.66" dur="6.6">pushing this really hard and we see that</text>
  <text start="480.99" dur="5.73">Senator Tom cotton released a statement</text>
  <text start="484.26" dur="4.77">calling for the country to reinvest in</text>
  <text start="486.72" dur="4.89">missile defense in the Pacific Mike</text>
  <text start="489.03" dur="6.38">Rogers called for Obama to dramatically</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="6.15">enhance trilateral missile defense and</text>
  <text start="495.41" dur="4.87">we see there are calls coming from</text>
  <text start="497.76" dur="6.21">Lockheed Martin missile defense system</text>
  <text start="500.28" dur="5.91">in South Korea Raytheon is saying yes we</text>
  <text start="503.97" dur="6.44">should be doing this and they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="506.19" dur="8.76">a lot of these representatives to push</text>
  <text start="510.41" dur="7.87">their goal and that is for the US</text>
  <text start="514.95" dur="7.89">government to spend more money on these</text>
  <text start="518.28" dur="6.99">missile systems and the other part of</text>
  <text start="522.84" dur="5.43">this agenda is basically to set these up</text>
  <text start="525.27" dur="6.29">and have them point to China and have</text>
  <text start="528.27" dur="7.35">them point to North Korea to continually</text>
  <text start="531.56" dur="7.87">maneuver military assets all in the</text>
  <text start="535.62" dur="6">Pacific which is a ring around China to</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="5.76">move military assets which they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="541.62" dur="6.54">doing in Eastern Europe to point all of</text>
  <text start="545.19" dur="5.37">it towards Russia and bring more and</text>
  <text start="548.16" dur="4.38">more military assets into Africa and the</text>
  <text start="550.56" dur="4.86">Middle East and all of this is being</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="5.25">done in preparation for World War three</text>
  <text start="555.42" dur="4.92">now yesterday we reported that South</text>
  <text start="557.79" dur="5.33">Korea is setting up their speaker</text>
  <text start="560.34" dur="5.51">systems their loudspeaker systems to</text>
  <text start="563.12" dur="7.2">basically blast propaganda into the</text>
  <text start="565.85" dur="7.79">North are also playing pop music into</text>
  <text start="570.32" dur="6.24">North Korea and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="5.98">South Korea as they&amp;#39;re setting this up</text>
  <text start="576.56" dur="5.279">and continually using the propaganda</text>
  <text start="579.62" dur="4.92">through the loudspeaker system they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581.839" dur="4.491">saying if North Korea attacks the</text>
  <text start="584.54" dur="5.46">loudspeakers we will immediately</text>
  <text start="586.33" dur="7.18">retaliate against them so you can see at</text>
  <text start="590" dur="6.089">this point they are getting ready with</text>
  <text start="593.51" dur="4.47">their provocation and they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="596.089" dur="3.75">making statements that if something does</text>
  <text start="597.98" dur="4.64">occur which they&amp;#39;re hoping it does</text>
  <text start="599.839" dur="5.971">because they would like to start the war</text>

  <text start="694.13" dur="4.27">long enough to get this offensive</text>
  <text start="696.57" dur="4.41">going because as we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="698.4" dur="4.73">continually bringing in military assets</text>

  <text start="747.78" dur="6.17">denied all these allegations but there</text>
  <text start="750.78" dur="6.03">is proof that there are people there and</text>
  <text start="753.95" dur="4.87">basically Britain acknowledged that yet</text>
  <text start="756.81" dur="3.9">ok we have military personnel in there</text>
  <text start="758.82" dur="3.21">but their trainers their advisers</text>
  <text start="760.71" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re just helping out a little bit in</text>

  <text start="763.98" dur="8.13">anything well they are doing things</text>
  <text start="766.8" dur="7.71">they&amp;#39;re engaged in combat and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="788.64" dur="4.47">we give bring in the puppet government</text>
  <text start="791.1" dur="4.29">once again and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="793.11" dur="5.15">trying to do all of this time but guess</text>
  <text start="795.39" dur="6.57">what it&amp;#39;s a lot harder than they thought</text>
  <text start="798.26" dur="6.4">we see her one is trying to make the</text>
  <text start="801.96" dur="5.22">case of why his troops are needed in</text>
  <text start="804.66" dur="5.46">Iraq he&amp;#39;s saying well look we were just</text>
  <text start="807.18" dur="4.86">attacked by the Islamic state now we</text>
  <text start="810.12" dur="3.47">know the Islamic state is the proxy army</text>
  <text start="812.04" dur="4.38">of the United States government and</text>
  <text start="813.59" dur="7.6">Turkey and the other coalition forces</text>
  <text start="816.42" dur="6.18">and if her one didn&amp;#39;t have his troops</text>
  <text start="821.19" dur="3.24">there guess what the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="822.6" dur="5.13">wouldn&amp;#39;t attacked but he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="824.43" dur="5.52">make the case to the world well this is</text>
  <text start="827.73" dur="2.94">why we&amp;#39;re here because look they were</text>
  <text start="829.95" dur="2.76">attacking</text>
  <text start="830.67" dur="5.16">bases in northern Iraq and thank God</text>
  <text start="832.71" dur="6.51">turkey the troops were there because we</text>
  <text start="835.83" dur="4.83">helped in the battle now again we know</text>
  <text start="839.22" dur="2.58">this is not the Islamic state because</text>
  <text start="840.66" dur="3.96">they wouldn&amp;#39;t be attacking their own</text>
  <text start="841.8" dur="7.7">practicing their own proxy army most</text>
  <text start="844.62" dur="7.65">likely it was other individuals in Iraq</text>
  <text start="849.5" dur="5.26">who want the puppet government out of</text>
  <text start="852.27" dur="3.9">Iraq and they were attacking in this</text>
  <text start="854.76" dur="4.77">region or it could have been the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="856.17" dur="5.91">army that was attacking or the whole</text>
  <text start="859.53" dur="5.22">thing could have just been made up but</text>
  <text start="862.08" dur="5.31">whatever it is her one is trying to</text>
  <text start="864.75" dur="5.37">convince the world of why he needs the</text>
  <text start="867.39" dur="5.88">troops in northern Iraq trying to</text>
  <text start="870.12" dur="5.37">convince the other governments a rack of</text>
  <text start="873.27" dur="7.98">why they should stay but guess what Iraq</text>
  <text start="875.49" dur="7.89">continually says remove your troops we</text>
  <text start="881.25" dur="5.25">see the Syrian rebels right now they are</text>
  <text start="883.38" dur="5.58">warning the UN do not put pressure on us</text>
  <text start="886.5" dur="5.37">because we don&amp;#39;t believe that this UN</text>
  <text start="888.96" dur="5.82">peace deal is in our benefit they have</text>
  <text start="891.87" dur="5.34">doubts about the un-led drive for peace</text>
  <text start="894.78" dur="6.06">talks which are about to begin in</text>
  <text start="897.21" dur="4.92">January 25th and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="900.84" dur="4.56">they don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="902.13" dur="5.85">attend right now because Assads future</text>
  <text start="905.4" dur="4.95">has not been determined and Russia</text>
  <text start="907.98" dur="4.95">continually repeats that Assad will be</text>
  <text start="910.35" dur="4.71">staying in power unless the people vote</text>
  <text start="912.93" dur="4.11">him out of power of course the United</text>
  <text start="915.06" dur="4.02">States is out there and they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="917.04" dur="6.09">the meme that Assad is going to be</text>
  <text start="919.08" dur="6.51">removed as of 27 2017 he can stay</text>
  <text start="923.13" dur="5.04">throughout this year but when 2017 comes</text>
  <text start="925.59" dur="6.98">we&amp;#39;re going to have a regime change well</text>
  <text start="928.17" dur="7.41">no there is no regime change the people</text>
  <text start="932.57" dur="6.48">will decide what&amp;#39;s going on so this</text>
  <text start="935.58" dur="7.38">tells us that the United States is</text>
  <text start="939.05" dur="7.03">buying time and they&amp;#39;re coming up with a</text>
  <text start="942.96" dur="5.73">complete different tactic to go after</text>
  <text start="946.08" dur="4.22">Assad because they know the people are</text>
  <text start="948.69" dur="4.92">not going to vote him out of office</text>
  <text start="950.3" dur="5.02">especially as Russia and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="953.61" dur="3.45">defense forces continually push the</text>
  <text start="955.32" dur="5.43">Islamic state out of the country right</text>
  <text start="957.06" dur="5.25">now the us ground troops I remember when</text>
  <text start="960.75" dur="3.33">Obama said there were going to be no</text>
  <text start="962.31" dur="2.189">ground troops in Syria or Iraq but I</text>
  <text start="964.08" dur="3.059">guess</text>
  <text start="964.499" dur="6.87">he lied to us once again the us ground</text>
  <text start="967.139" dur="6.99">forces are now stationed in the areas of</text>
  <text start="971.369" dur="6.45">the tishreen dam northeast of Aleppo</text>
  <text start="974.129" dur="4.98">remember Aleppo Russia the Syrian</text>
  <text start="977.819" dur="3.69">defense forces have been pushing the</text>
  <text start="979.109" dur="6.18">Islamic state out of that area and why</text>
  <text start="981.509" dur="5.67">would the u.s. go into the area where</text>
  <text start="985.289" dur="7.14">the Islamic state has been pushed out</text>
  <text start="987.179" dur="6.96">because right now ah the Syrian the free</text>
  <text start="992.429" dur="3.51">syrian army or the syrian democratic</text>
  <text start="994.139" dur="3.18">forces whatever they&amp;#39;re calling them</text>
  <text start="995.939" dur="4.35">today i&amp;#39;m just going to keep calling</text>
  <text start="997.319" dur="7.05">them the free syrian army they have</text>
  <text start="1000.289" dur="12.14">control of the dam so US troops are</text>
  <text start="1004.369" dur="14.91">coming in to fortify and control the dam</text>
  <text start="1012.429" dur="10.18">so Russia and the Assad forces can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1019.279" dur="5.581">come in and hit that area and push out</text>
  <text start="1022.609" dur="8.55">the Islamic state and the Free Syrian</text>
  <text start="1024.86" dur="10.729">Army and if by accident Russia or Assad</text>
  <text start="1031.159" dur="7.41">hits the US troops they have their war</text>
  <text start="1035.589" dur="5.11">so we can see right now what the plan is</text>
  <text start="1038.569" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re positioning the US troops in</text>
  <text start="1040.699" dur="5.7">these certain areas to reinforce the</text>
  <text start="1044.329" dur="3.48">Free Syrian Army and the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1046.399" dur="5.791">which really the Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="1047.809" dur="8.85">Islamic state are one in the same so at</text>
  <text start="1052.19" dur="8.189">this point they are waiting and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1056.659" dur="7.831">hoping for some type of incident because</text>
  <text start="1060.379" dur="9.331">you know by doing this the risk factor</text>
  <text start="1064.49" dur="9.24">goes way up now the o pwc came out with</text>
  <text start="1069.71" dur="6.15">report and we understand they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1073.73" dur="6.949">yes they were sarin gas being used in</text>
  <text start="1075.86" dur="8.929">Assyria and the report now cooperates</text>
  <text start="1080.679" dur="7.75">the Syrian government&amp;#39;s assertions that</text>
  <text start="1084.789" dur="6.461">the factions were responsible for the</text>
  <text start="1088.429" dur="5.511">chemical attack the Free Syrian Army the</text>
  <text start="1091.25" dur="6.049">Islamic state via al Qaeda at the time</text>
  <text start="1093.94" dur="8.939">because remember</text>
  <text start="1097.299" dur="7.98">asad invited the organization for</text>
  <text start="1102.879" dur="5.64">prohibition of chemical weapons into the</text>
  <text start="1105.279" dur="5.72">country to investigate who used the</text>
  <text start="1108.519" dur="5.311">sarin gas and the report right now is</text>
  <text start="1110.999" dur="5.56">basically backing up everything he said</text>
  <text start="1113.83" dur="7.679">that it was the Free Syrian Army that it</text>
  <text start="1116.559" dur="11.97">was Al Qaeda at the time and we know</text>
  <text start="1121.509" dur="12.061">during the 2013-14 art me out of the</text>
  <text start="1128.529" dur="10.291">area Assad his forces found sarin gas in</text>
  <text start="1133.57" dur="7.109">a cave MIT did a test of where the</text>
  <text start="1138.82" dur="4.049">missile was actually fired and they said</text>
  <text start="1140.679" dur="5.37">it was impossible for the sarin gas</text>
  <text start="1142.869" dur="5.721">missile to be fired from where the ass</text>
  <text start="1146.049" dur="5.73">up where the Assad forces were based</text>
  <text start="1148.59" dur="6.269">when they recalculated the trajectory it</text>
  <text start="1151.779" dur="6.15">actually came from the Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="1154.859" dur="4.601">so we can see right now the US</text>
  <text start="1157.929" dur="4.411">government central banker is completely</text>
