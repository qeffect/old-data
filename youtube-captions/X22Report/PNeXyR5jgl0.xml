  <text start="89.97" dur="4.8">bad news we talked about retail a couple</text>
  <text start="92.79" dur="5.219">of days ago how it wasn&amp;#39;t going to look</text>
  <text start="94.77" dur="7.47">good and retail came out and it is a</text>
  <text start="98.009" dur="6.21">complete disaster but in the eurozone we</text>
  <text start="102.24" dur="5.729">see the quarterly rate of growth has</text>
  <text start="104.219" dur="7.561">halved from january to march with a</text>
  <text start="107.969" dur="8.76">point six percent expansion france and</text>
  <text start="111.78" dur="8.759">italy they have stalled right now it</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="6.06">does not look good growth in germany the</text>
  <text start="120.539" dur="4.5">union&amp;#39;s biggest economy slowed</text>

  <text start="125.039" dur="4.561">quarter there at point seven percent it</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="4.23">slowed the point for so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="129.6" dur="5.61">seeing right now is a complete breakdown</text>
  <text start="132" dur="6.89">of the economic system and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="135.21" dur="8.07">spreading here in the united states</text>
  <text start="138.89" dur="8.47">retail is a complete disaster retail the</text>
  <text start="143.28" dur="6.84">sales excluding autos &amp;amp; gas fell by 0.1%</text>
  <text start="147.36" dur="6.87">month a month they expected it to rise</text>
  <text start="150.12" dur="6.3">by 0.3% this is the weakest since</text>
  <text start="154.23" dur="5.9">january and they can&amp;#39;t really blame the</text>
  <text start="156.42" dur="8.49">weather right now we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="160.13" dur="8.38">stores closing people being laid off</text>
  <text start="164.91" dur="8.76">and the situation is not getting better</text>
  <text start="168.51" dur="10.71">the weakness was from Sporting Goods</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="9.21">sales department stores and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="179.22" dur="7.65">seeing right now is that retail is dead</text>
  <text start="182.88" dur="6.29">in the water and year-on-year growth in</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="6.96">retail slow to two-point-three percent</text>
  <text start="189.17" dur="9.37">this is at a level where we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="7.86">last recession so the situation has not</text>
  <text start="198.54" dur="6.57">improved and if you look at retail</text>
  <text start="201.69" dur="6.84">coming out of 2008 it has gone</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="8.28">absolutely nowhere we&amp;#39;ve been hovering</text>
  <text start="208.53" dur="7.38">on the line of recession for all of</text>
  <text start="213.39" dur="5.1">these years I know they tried to make it</text>
  <text start="215.91" dur="4.83">look good but again you have to remember</text>
  <text start="218.49" dur="6.99">the central banks all they can do is</text>
  <text start="220.74" dur="6.84">create currency they can&amp;#39;t make people</text>
  <text start="225.48" dur="4.92">go purchase especially when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.58" dur="4.53">getting laid off and what happens is</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="6.559">when people aren&amp;#39;t purchasing in retail</text>
  <text start="232.11" dur="8.78">and retail is slowing inventories build</text>
  <text start="236.959" dur="8.891">manufacturing slows the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="240.89" dur="8.55">drops and we&amp;#39;re continually seeing this</text>
  <text start="245.85" dur="6.51">and when we look at these retail numbers</text>
  <text start="249.44" dur="4.98">the electronics appliance stores they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.36" dur="4.29">down by negative point one percent</text>
  <text start="254.42" dur="4.33">building materials down by negative</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="5.58">point five percent food and beverage</text>
  <text start="258.75" dur="6.36">beverage down- point-six percent health</text>
  <text start="262.23" dur="7.05">&amp;amp; personal care stores point one percent</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="5.61">gasoline stations down- 2.7% clothing</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="5.76">down negative point five percent</text>
  <text start="270.72" dur="6.449">Sporting Goods down- 2.2% general</text>
  <text start="275.04" dur="5.04">merchandise down negative point one</text>
  <text start="277.169" dur="7.681">percent department stores down negative</text>
  <text start="280.08" dur="6.48">0.5% so restaurants food services</text>
  <text start="284.85" dur="3.81">drinking places down negative point two</text>
  <text start="286.56" dur="5.01">percent so when we look at all this what</text>
  <text start="288.66" dur="7.83">do we see we see that everything is</text>
  <text start="291.57" dur="7.01">continually contracting auto inventory</text>
  <text start="296.49" dur="5.82">sales ratio pushes back to recession</text>
  <text start="298.58" dur="7">psychol highs for the 18th month in a</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="6.51">row annual changes in sales declined and</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="5.4">inventories have shot up and we talked</text>
  <text start="308.82" dur="4.05">about channel stuffing before how the</text>
  <text start="310.98" dur="6.39">auto manufacturers channel stuff the</text>
  <text start="312.87" dur="10.29">lots and as they bring in more cars that</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="9.87">is counted as a sale so sales have been</text>
  <text start="323.16" dur="7.67">declining inventories are going up this</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="10.8">is what we saw during the recession in</text>
  <text start="330.83" dur="10.42">2008 and the situation is dire right now</text>
  <text start="338.04" dur="7.14">it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse as we move</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="6">forward remember with the auto industry</text>
  <text start="345.18" dur="3.959">they tried to bring in all the subprime</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="3.57">people you don&amp;#39;t have credit you have a</text>
  <text start="349.139" dur="3.061">heartbeat doesn&amp;#39;t really matter we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="350.82" dur="3.18">give you an automobile because this is</text>
  <text start="352.2" dur="5.67">what the central bankers can control</text>
  <text start="354" dur="9">they can control handing out debt auto</text>
  <text start="357.87" dur="7.77">loans housing student loans they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="363" dur="6.09">get people to take their hard-earned</text>
  <text start="365.64" dur="5.49">money and use it in retail many people</text>
  <text start="369.09" dur="4.56">their credit cards are maxed out so they</text>
  <text start="371.13" dur="4.8">can&amp;#39;t even use that but to get an auto</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="5.49">loan to get a student loan to get a</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="5.34">mortgage they try to make it possible</text>
  <text start="379.14" dur="4.589">for everyone by lowering the</text>
  <text start="381.27" dur="4.86">requirements further and further and</text>
  <text start="383.729" dur="6.121">further down until they hit zero and</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="6.78">then what do you do now everyone has a</text>
  <text start="389.85" dur="6.9">huge amount of debt this country this</text>
  <text start="392.91" dur="9.53">world that the central bankers run they</text>
  <text start="396.75" dur="8.13">run it on debt this is what they push</text>
  <text start="402.44" dur="8.89">we&amp;#39;re seeing producer prices they</text>
  <text start="404.88" dur="10.56">unexpectedly slit by negative 0.4% now</text>
  <text start="411.33" dur="6.54">remember as gas prices drop prices on</text>
  <text start="415.44" dur="6.06">goods will also drop at the same time</text>
  <text start="417.87" dur="5.79">now I noticed that milk and other things</text>
  <text start="421.5" dur="4.59">are starting to move up once again even</text>
  <text start="423.66" dur="6.96">no gas prices are going down and this is</text>
  <text start="426.09" dur="6.95">not a good sign so we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="430.62" dur="4.41">entire economy</text>
  <text start="433.04" dur="3.91">start to fall apart we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="435.03" dur="4.44">deflation we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation at the</text>
  <text start="436.95" dur="5.31">same time I think it&amp;#39;s going to be like</text>
  <text start="439.47" dur="4.62">a tidal wave where the water recedes we</text>
  <text start="442.26" dur="4.47">see the deflation and then all of a</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="4.65">sudden out of nowhere we get hit with</text>
  <text start="446.73" dur="5.52">the gigantic tidal wave and then all of</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="5.67">a sudden we see hyperinflation now</text>
  <text start="452.25" dur="6.63">something very interesting happened</text>
  <text start="454.41" dur="10.14">today and it&amp;#39;s time to worry because we</text>
  <text start="458.88" dur="9.51">heard this before James Bullard came out</text>
  <text start="464.55" dur="7.16">and said the following we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="468.39" dur="8.85">recession risk likely in the near term</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="9.16">now back in July 10 2008 he went out and</text>
  <text start="477.24" dur="8.61">said we&amp;#39;re going to see modest growth</text>
  <text start="480.87" dur="7.68">and in august of 2008 he said the</text>
  <text start="485.85" dur="7.29">economy according to available real-time</text>
  <text start="488.55" dur="6.869">data was good Bernanke came out and said</text>
  <text start="493.14" dur="4.74">we are not forecasting a recession</text>
  <text start="495.419" dur="6.75">anytime soon in the same year that we</text>
  <text start="497.88" dur="7.08">had the recession which is 2008 and back</text>
  <text start="502.169" dur="5.371">in 2008 James Bullard said that there</text>
  <text start="504.96" dur="4.769">was no recession according to the</text>
  <text start="507.54" dur="4.53">conventional definition of two</text>
  <text start="509.729" dur="7.341">consecutive quarters of negative gdp</text>
  <text start="512.07" dur="9">growth so we fast forward to today</text>
  <text start="517.07" dur="10.75">August of 2016 where he said the same</text>
  <text start="521.07" dur="9.63">exact thing this tells us right now we</text>
  <text start="527.82" dur="5.97">are very close to this economic collapse</text>
  <text start="530.7" dur="6.78">because when they come out and they tell</text>
  <text start="533.79" dur="6.15">us don&amp;#39;t worry about it we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="5.52">forecasting a recession we don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="539.94" dur="7.61">see it not even a year or two years from</text>
  <text start="543" dur="7.62">now this is the time to start to worry</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="5.11">because that means they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="550.62" dur="5.1">fool everyone into thinking that the</text>
  <text start="552.66" dur="5.13">economy is healthy and then all of a</text>
  <text start="555.72" dur="4.29">sudden everything is going to collapse</text>
  <text start="557.79" dur="7.73">we saw it happen in 2008 they are</text>
  <text start="560.01" dur="8.45">following the same exact pattern</text>
  <text start="565.52" dur="6.5">and everyone should be worried everyone</text>
  <text start="568.46" dur="6.92">should be prepared at this point</text>
  <text start="572.02" dur="5.98">everyone should be going to the store</text>
  <text start="575.38" dur="5.74">doesn&amp;#39;t matter where you go and they</text>
  <text start="578" dur="8.94">need to start purchasing food water</text>
  <text start="581.12" dur="8.88">supplies get a weapon have cash on hand</text>
  <text start="586.94" dur="7.11">get gold and silver because it looks</text>
  <text start="590" dur="5.97">like the time period of one we hit it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="594.05" dur="4.05">going to be absolutely awful and you</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="6.12">have to remember something very very</text>
  <text start="598.1" dur="6.57">important because we only find this out</text>
  <text start="602.09" dur="5.04">afterwards I mean we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="604.67" dur="5.19">about that we&amp;#39;re in a recession most</text>
  <text start="607.13" dur="3.69">likely a depression right now but the</text>
  <text start="609.86" dur="4.68">United States government hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="610.82" dur="8.4">announced it if we go back in time to</text>
  <text start="614.54" dur="8.79">2008 during august of two thousand two</text>
  <text start="619.22" dur="6.66">thousand eight the economy was already</text>
  <text start="623.33" dur="5.52">in a recession for eight months now they</text>
  <text start="625.88" dur="7.86">came out with that information many many</text>
  <text start="628.85" dur="6.39">many many months later on so think about</text>
  <text start="633.74" dur="2.58">what&amp;#39;s happening right now everything</text>
  <text start="635.24" dur="4.43">that you&amp;#39;re seeing everything then we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="636.32" dur="8.19">been talking about GDP retail</text>
  <text start="639.67" dur="8.14">unemployment the contraction of all the</text>
  <text start="644.51" dur="6.81">economic sectors this is exactly what we</text>
  <text start="647.81" dur="6.81">saw in 2008 well actually this time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="651.32" dur="6.15">a little bit worse because we&amp;#39;re below</text>
  <text start="654.62" dur="7.5">the 2008 levels in many of these areas</text>
  <text start="657.47" dur="7.05">and this shows us that they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="662.12" dur="6.72">to even let us know when we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="664.52" dur="7.46">recession or depression they won&amp;#39;t say a</text>
  <text start="668.84" dur="5.1">word even when the markets coming down I</text>
  <text start="671.98" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t even think that going to mention</text>
  <text start="673.94" dur="5.25">it they might say we&amp;#39;re approaching it</text>
  <text start="676.54" dur="4.93">but it will take them a couple of months</text>
  <text start="679.19" dur="6.03">to admit that there is a major major</text>
  <text start="681.47" dur="5.7">problem and they won&amp;#39;t even tell you</text>
  <text start="685.22" dur="4.71">that we&amp;#39;ve been in it for many many</text>
  <text start="687.17" dur="6.18">months well I&amp;#39;m telling you we have been</text>
  <text start="689.93" dur="5.82">in it this is it and it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="693.35" dur="5.94">worse if you&amp;#39;re feeling the pain right</text>
  <text start="695.75" dur="5.519">now in a couple of months</text>
  <text start="699.29" dur="5.549">the pain is going to get worse not to</text>
  <text start="701.269" dur="5.37">scare you not to say everyone has to</text>
  <text start="704.839" dur="3.75">feel the pain but those people are</text>
  <text start="706.639" dur="3.901">feeling it it&amp;#39;s going to get worse those</text>
  <text start="708.589" dur="4.771">who are not feeling it well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="710.54" dur="7.289">going to feel it this is just the way it</text>
  <text start="713.36" dur="7.83">works and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="717.829" dur="6.481">we&amp;#39;re heading right into the same area</text>
  <text start="721.19" dur="5.79">that we headed into in 2008 think about</text>
  <text start="724.31" dur="6.06">during 2008 what was coming up during</text>
  <text start="726.98" dur="7.5">this period the elections where are we</text>
