  <text start="64.96" dur="4.409">episode is it is becoming extremely hard</text>
  <text start="67.69" dur="4.98">to ignore the fact the economy is</text>
  <text start="69.369" dur="5.461">collapsing let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>

  <text start="74.83" dur="5.01">following all the economic facts and we</text>
  <text start="77.619" dur="4.941">are getting more and more indicators</text>
  <text start="79.84" dur="6.419">that are just pointing in one direction</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="6.49">and one direction only we are seeing</text>
  <text start="86.259" dur="4.92">signs that problems well they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="89.05" dur="4.849">all around us they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="91.179" dur="6.271">everywhere and the entire system is</text>

  <text start="103.149" dur="5.821">percent and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="106.24" dur="5.6">is that they&amp;#39;ve been channel stuffing</text>
  <text start="108.97" dur="6.149">all the dealer lumps right now and</text>
  <text start="111.84" dur="6.129">basically they have to stop production</text>
  <text start="115.119" dur="4.951">because there are so many cars and they</text>
  <text start="117.969" dur="4.711">have to wait for all these cars to be</text>
  <text start="120.07" dur="5.67">sold now what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is there</text>
  <text start="122.68" dur="5.76">are many dealerships that just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="125.74" dur="6.39">move the cars and this is now becoming a</text>

  <text start="151.9" dur="4.679">rapidly right now and it goes back to</text>
  <text start="155.47" dur="3.92">the same thing we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="156.579" dur="6.03">for a very long time these individuals</text>
  <text start="159.39" dur="4.93">who are losing their jobs these people</text>
  <text start="162.609" dur="3.63">who are not making enough money they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.32" dur="5.43">not thinking about going out and buying</text>
  <text start="166.239" dur="5.131">a new car yes they went ahead and they</text>
  <text start="169.75" dur="3.81">went to the subprime people to the sub</text>
  <text start="171.37" dur="4.649">sub sub prime people because they needed</text>
  <text start="173.56" dur="4.92">to do this the central bankers of the</text>
  <text start="176.019" dur="4.231">auto industry to get as many people in</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="4.47">as possible because they were running</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="5.879">out of good people with good credit</text>
  <text start="182.95" dur="3.78">those who had jobs so they were going to</text>

  <text start="190.959" dur="7.92">people this is the problem right now and</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="4.329">we could see that people are out there</text>
  <text start="198.879" dur="4.17">and they&amp;#39;re saying you know something I</text>
  <text start="200.019" dur="6.72">can basically hold off I don&amp;#39;t need a</text>
  <text start="203.049" dur="6.931">new vehicle at this point or they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="212.049" dur="3.33">talked about how the housing market is</text>
  <text start="213.579" dur="4.5">continuing declining and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="215.379" dur="5.67">more information that pretty much backs</text>
  <text start="218.079" dur="5.94">all of this up u.s. construction right</text>
  <text start="221.049" dur="6.091">right now be spending on construction it</text>
  <text start="224.019" dur="6.241">is collapsed in July to one point six</text>
  <text start="227.14" dur="7.02">percent this is the weakest since 2011</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="5.67">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="234.16" dur="3.6">the federal government construction</text>
  <text start="235.93" dur="3.75">spending while it crashed by nine point</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="4.259">five percent this is the largest drop</text>
  <text start="239.68" dur="4.23">since December of 2010 public</text>
  <text start="242.019" dur="3.961">construction spending has hovered in</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="5.49">negative territory for the most part of</text>
  <text start="245.98" dur="5.4">the past year government projects share</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="4.32">of total construction outlays will let</text>
  <text start="251.38" dur="6.21">with less than 22 percent anjuna</text>
  <text start="253.72" dur="7.319">smallest since 2006 this is not</text>
  <text start="257.59" dur="7.139">transitory when we look at the graph and</text>
  <text start="261.039" dur="6.411">we go back to 2008 2009 we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="264.729" dur="5.94">trending downward we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="4.99">manufacturing well really nothing has</text>
  <text start="270.669" dur="3.601">improved there the hard data and the</text>
  <text start="272.44" dur="6.33">American economy it is completely</text>
  <text start="274.27" dur="6.869">collapsing and the soft data that might</text>
  <text start="278.77" dur="4.23">be going up but the hard data the hard</text>
  <text start="281.139" dur="4.801">data that shows what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="283" dur="5.789">in the economy it&amp;#39;s falling apart new</text>
  <text start="285.94" dur="4.5">orders are slumping right now and it</text>
  <text start="288.789" dur="3.661">looks like at this point that the</text>
  <text start="290.44" dur="4.65">situation in manufacturing has not</text>
  <text start="292.45" dur="4.649">improved whatsoever now we see that</text>
  <text start="295.09" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;ve been revising the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="297.099" dur="5.19">the DEA also had to adjust personal</text>
  <text start="299.68" dur="5.4">income spending with the full results</text>
  <text start="302.289" dur="6.901">released in July&amp;#39;s report now what it</text>
  <text start="305.08" dur="6.69">revealed was very striking over the</text>
  <text start="309.19" dur="5.599">revised period disposable personal</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="6.209">income for the US households was slashed</text>
  <text start="314.789" dur="5.561">culet illy by over a hundred twenty</text>
  <text start="317.979" dur="6.171">billion which is just under 40</text>
  <text start="320.35" dur="6.75">point four trillion now we also see that</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="5.88">government pay well that has remained</text>
  <text start="327.1" dur="6.27">flat over the past three years</text>
  <text start="330.03" dur="4.03">growing in the mid 2% to like around 3%</text>
  <text start="333.37" dur="3.15">range</text>
  <text start="334.06" dur="6.96">wages and salaries for private workers</text>
  <text start="336.52" dur="7.56">well they&amp;#39;ve steadily declined wage</text>
  <text start="341.02" dur="6.36">growth has slumped to just 2.5 percent</text>
  <text start="344.08" dur="6.27">in June but there&amp;#39;s something even more</text>
  <text start="347.38" dur="5.82">troubling about all of this in the</text>
  <text start="350.35" dur="5.85">revision that they put out the drop in</text>
  <text start="353.2" dur="4.4">income and burst in spending means for</text>
  <text start="356.2" dur="3.99">the average households bank account</text>
  <text start="357.6" dur="6.36">following the latest annual revision so</text>
  <text start="360.19" dur="6.48">what this means is that they revised</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="5.62">personal income personal spending and</text>
  <text start="366.67" dur="4.8">this revision means that a quarter</text>
  <text start="369.58" dur="5.01">trillion dollars or two hundred twenty</text>
  <text start="371.47" dur="7.05">six point three billion in savings was</text>
  <text start="374.59" dur="5.91">just wiped away from US households this</text>
  <text start="378.52" dur="4.71">means that either households will have</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="5.07">to incur this much debt to continue on</text>
  <text start="383.23" dur="4.53">their previous spending treadline or a</text>
  <text start="385.57" dur="5.01">quarter trillion and potential growth</text>
  <text start="387.76" dur="5.61">from the future economy has just been</text>
  <text start="390.58" dur="5.91">chopped off now we need to remember</text>
  <text start="393.37" dur="6.96">something seventy percent of u.s. GDP is</text>
  <text start="396.49" dur="5.22">the result of consumer spending and what</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="401.71" dur="4.53">trying to manipulate everything and</text>
  <text start="403.33" dur="7.23">these manipulations well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="406.24" dur="7.47">working out too well we also see income</text>
  <text start="410.56" dur="5.55">growth there&amp;#39;s a problem there now after</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="3.96">last week&amp;#39;s revised BLS data which</text>
  <text start="416.11" dur="4.62">showed desperate Americans saving the</text>
  <text start="417.67" dur="7.44">least since the recession personal</text>
  <text start="420.73" dur="7.26">income growth ended in June at 0%</text>
  <text start="425.11" dur="6.36">they missed expectations and falling to</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="7.26">its lowest level since November spending</text>
  <text start="431.47" dur="7.07">growth has also slumped so real personal</text>
  <text start="435.25" dur="6.66">spending month on month has declined</text>
  <text start="438.54" dur="6.88">rapidly and it has completely stalled</text>
  <text start="441.91" dur="5.58">and when we look at the economy we can</text>
  <text start="445.42" dur="4.05">see that this does have an effect on</text>
  <text start="447.49" dur="3.78">what is going on in the retail market in</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="4.29">the housing market in the automobile</text>
  <text start="451.27" dur="4.89">market and it show</text>
  <text start="453.76" dur="4.02">is that most of this manipulated data</text>
  <text start="456.16" dur="7.53">that they&amp;#39;ve been throwing at us is</text>
  <text start="457.78" dur="8.49">completely not true and when we really</text>
  <text start="463.69" dur="3.84">look closely at what the economy has</text>
  <text start="466.27" dur="4.05">been doing we can see that it is</text>
  <text start="467.53" dur="5.7">completely falling apart these are the</text>
  <text start="470.32" dur="4.5">real facts yes they can throw out the</text>
  <text start="473.23" dur="4.26">unemployment numbers they can tell it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.82" dur="6.17">1% it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter but when we</text>
  <text start="477.49" dur="6.39">start looking at spending patterns</text>
  <text start="480.99" dur="5.92">income patterns when we look at the</text>
  <text start="483.88" dur="6.27">automobile market the retail market this</text>
  <text start="486.91" dur="5.28">is actually telling us the true story of</text>
  <text start="490.15" dur="3.96">what is going on remember what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="492.19" dur="4.68">been doing is they&amp;#39;ve been creating this</text>
  <text start="494.11" dur="4.68">illusion to make us believe that this</text>
  <text start="496.87" dur="5.07">economy is doing well and they needed</text>
  <text start="498.79" dur="5.85">all different ways to keep this illusion</text>
  <text start="501.94" dur="5.16">alive now one of the ways was during the</text>
  <text start="504.64" dur="5.61">Obama presidency where they needed a way</text>
  <text start="507.1" dur="4.35">for the Treasury bonds to be purchased</text>
  <text start="510.25" dur="3.75">because a lot of countries were dumping</text>
  <text start="511.45" dur="4.8">Treasury bonds and the Fed was having a</text>
  <text start="514" dur="5.13">difficult time continually buying all</text>
  <text start="516.25" dur="7.83">the Treasuries not that they can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="519.13" dur="7.65">they wanted a different financial area</text>
  <text start="524.08" dur="4.98">where they can have Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="526.78" dur="5.79">continually be purchased so they came up</text>
  <text start="529.06" dur="6.75">with the idea of my RA which is a</text>
  <text start="532.57" dur="6.36">retirement vehicle and they wanted the</text>
  <text start="535.81" dur="6.27">American people out there to use this</text>
  <text start="538.93" dur="5.43">now once again this is part of the Ponzi</text>
  <text start="542.08" dur="4.01">scheme because when you place your money</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="5.19">into these my Ras</text>
  <text start="546.09" dur="8.05">guess what you&amp;#39;re purchasing US</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="6.75">government bonds so back then in 2015</text>
  <text start="554.14" dur="4.32">Obama ordered the creation of the</text>
  <text start="556.3" dur="4.77">so-called starter accounts three years</text>
  <text start="558.46" dur="3.24">ago and it became available at the end</text>
  <text start="561.07" dur="3.87">of 2015</text>
  <text start="561.7" dur="5.4">since then around 20,000 accounts have</text>
  <text start="564.94" dur="4.44">been open with participants contributing</text>
  <text start="567.1" dur="4.83">around 34 million dollars and according</text>
  <text start="569.38" dur="4.95">to the Treasury the median account</text>
  <text start="571.93" dur="6.87">balance was around 500 bucks</text>
  <text start="574.33" dur="9.21">the program has cost though 70 million</text>
  <text start="578.8" dur="8.76">dollars and it&amp;#39;s costing 10 million a</text>
  <text start="583.54" dur="7.5">year to keep this operational</text>
  <text start="587.56" dur="6.6">so basically the government is spending</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="6.799">a lot of money to have the people of the</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="6.51">United States buy Treasury bonds and</text>
  <text start="597.839" dur="6.97">right now Trump is looking at this and</text>
  <text start="600.67" dur="6.659">saying no more this is done he&amp;#39;s cutting</text>
  <text start="604.809" dur="5.791">it off there&amp;#39;s no purpose in it right</text>
  <text start="607.329" dur="5.911">now what the government actually did but</text>
  <text start="610.6" dur="5.31">as they set up some type of Ponzi scheme</text>
  <text start="613.24" dur="3.209">and we see these Ponzi schemes all over</text>
  <text start="615.91" dur="3.21">the place</text>
  <text start="616.449" dur="4.921">stock market is really a Ponzi scheme is</text>
  <text start="619.12" dur="4.199">completely manipulated and when we look</text>
  <text start="621.37" dur="4.589">at the stock market today the last time</text>
  <text start="623.319" dur="4.83">the stocks were this expensive was back</text>
  <text start="625.959" dur="4.8">in the year 2000 and we know what</text>
  <text start="628.149" dur="5.701">happened in the year 2000 this was the</text>
  <text start="630.759" dur="5.94">tech bubble and we know what happened</text>
  <text start="633.85" dur="5.279">during this period and we are right back</text>
  <text start="636.699" dur="7.2">at where we were back then</text>
  <text start="639.129" dur="7.411">with the valuation of stocks so what are</text>
  <text start="643.899" dur="6.24">we seeing right now we are seeing</text>
  <text start="646.54" dur="6.769">everything continually pointing to one</text>
  <text start="650.139" dur="6.12">thing and one thing only the economy is</text>
  <text start="653.309" dur="6.041">deteriorating very very quickly we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="656.259" dur="4.651">seeing these real facts that are coming</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="4.13">out these real indicators that are</text>
  <text start="660.91" dur="5.58">coming out they are showing us that</text>
  <text start="663.48" dur="5.26">everything is rapidly falling apart and</text>
  <text start="666.49" dur="4.709">there&amp;#39;s nothing the government can do</text>
  <text start="668.74" dur="6.269">there&amp;#39;s nothing the Fed can do because</text>
  <text start="671.199" dur="6.12">what happens when reality sets in</text>
  <text start="675.009" dur="5.19">this is there this has always been their</text>
  <text start="677.319" dur="5.88">problem when people start to realize</text>
  <text start="680.199" dur="5.49">that the economy isn&amp;#39;t what it really is</text>
  <text start="683.199" dur="5.221">this is when it falls apart this is when</text>
  <text start="685.689" dur="5.431">they lose control they can manipulate up</text>
  <text start="688.42" dur="5.009">to a certain point but people stops and</text>
  <text start="691.12" dur="4.529">they stop believing in the manipulation</text>
  <text start="693.429" dur="5.25">at a certain point and this is where</text>
  <text start="695.649" dur="6.93">everything starts to go south and we</text>
  <text start="698.679" dur="6.45">realize that at this time they need to</text>
  <text start="702.579" dur="4.17">keep the illusion going for as long as</text>
  <text start="705.129" dur="3.841">they possibly can because what they want</text>
  <text start="706.749" dur="3.51">to do is they want to turn around and</text>
  <text start="708.97" dur="3.839">blame this all on Trump they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="710.259" dur="4.62">started the process of pointing the</text>
  <text start="712.809" dur="3.78">finger at Trump at his policies and</text>
  <text start="714.879" dur="3.841">everything that it&amp;#39;s been doing and we</text>
  <text start="716.589" dur="4.381">can see as we move forward they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="718.72" dur="5.15">to continually do this now</text>
  <text start="720.97" dur="6.03">we know that Trump is going to be</text>
  <text start="723.87" dur="4.75">looking at this sanctions bill that the</text>
  <text start="727" dur="3.96">Senate passed and then think it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="728.62" dur="3.87">of veto proof right now unless you can</text>
  <text start="730.96" dur="4.11">come up with some way and we mention</text>
  <text start="732.49" dur="7.38">other ways yesterday in the report of</text>
  <text start="735.07" dur="6.6">how he can maybe lessen the impact but</text>
  <text start="739.87" dur="3.95">again we have to understand that this</text>
  <text start="741.67" dur="6.3">might have an effect on the economy also</text>
  <text start="743.82" dur="7.02">because if this is signed or even if you</text>
  <text start="747.97" dur="7.08">vetoes it it will still go forward and</text>
  <text start="750.84" dur="6.46">this will bring other countries closer</text>
  <text start="755.05" dur="4.68">together we&amp;#39;ll bring China Russia even</text>
  <text start="757.3" dur="5.16">closer I&amp;#39;ll bring the European countries</text>
  <text start="759.73" dur="5.28">even closer and other countries might</text>
  <text start="762.46" dur="6.83">start making deals with each other where</text>
  <text start="765.01" dur="7.38">they might not trade in the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="769.29" dur="7.48">just to get back at the United States</text>
  <text start="772.39" dur="7.65">now once again this is going to have an</text>
  <text start="776.77" dur="6.81">effect on the entire economy because as</text>
  <text start="780.04" dur="6.36">the petro dollar fails as more and more</text>
  <text start="783.58" dur="5.31">countries they decide not to use it</text>
  <text start="786.4" dur="5.37">well those dollars come back to the</text>
  <text start="788.89" dur="5.67">United States and what we see here is</text>
  <text start="791.77" dur="5.64">once those dollars enter circulation we</text>
  <text start="794.56" dur="4.62">will see inflation and once these</text>
  <text start="797.41" dur="4.14">countries stop using the petro dollar to</text>
  <text start="799.18" dur="8.28">purchase oil what happens to the price</text>
  <text start="801.55" dur="9.63">of oil that might even go up so what the</text>
  <text start="807.46" dur="5.19">deep state what these bad guys are doing</text>
  <text start="811.18" dur="4.65">right now they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="812.65" dur="6.96">possibly can to maintain control of the</text>
  <text start="815.83" dur="6.99">system and by doing this they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="819.61" dur="8.55">if it hurts the system they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="822.82" dur="7.85">about anyone except themselves because</text>
  <text start="828.16" dur="5.94">look what purpose does it serve in</text>
  <text start="830.67" dur="5.68">pushing these sanctions out there I mean</text>
  <text start="834.1" dur="5.16">the allies of the United States are</text>
  <text start="836.35" dur="7.61">saying this is completely wrong but the</text>
  <text start="839.26" dur="6.63">Senate the house they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="843.96" dur="5.53">corporations are saying this is not</text>
  <text start="845.89" dur="5.699">going to work out well but it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="849.49" dur="4.69">matter because they&amp;#39;re not working for</text>
  <text start="851.589" dur="6.161">the people they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="854.18" dur="6.21">or other entities and this is the major</text>
  <text start="857.75" dur="4.68">problem and as we continue down this</text>
  <text start="860.39" dur="4.949">path going throughout this the rest of</text>
  <text start="862.43" dur="4.98">this year as we&amp;#39;ve been tracking all</text>
  <text start="865.339" dur="4.681">this we&amp;#39;re seeing everything deteriorate</text>
  <text start="867.41" dur="6.179">very very quickly it&amp;#39;s accelerating</text>
  <text start="870.02" dur="6.24">right now other countries even the</text>
  <text start="873.589" dur="6.81">allies of the u.s. they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="876.26" dur="7.68">move away from the US and we can see</text>
  <text start="880.399" dur="6.901">that as this happens well it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="883.94" dur="5.37">to turn out well for the US because the</text>
  <text start="887.3" dur="3.44">system is going to collapse these other</text>
  <text start="889.31" dur="4.339">countries are going to be looking at</text>
  <text start="890.74" dur="4.78">Russia or China or other countries</text>
  <text start="893.649" dur="5.021">they&amp;#39;re not going to be doing business</text>
  <text start="895.52" dur="7.71">with the US and this is not going to</text>
  <text start="898.67" dur="6.39">help the situation at all but when we</text>
  <text start="903.23" dur="5.609">look at what the government is doing the</text>
  <text start="905.06" dur="6.48">Senate the house the bad guys they</text>
  <text start="908.839" dur="4.021">really don&amp;#39;t care because they only see</text>
  <text start="911.54" dur="5.1">one thing and one thing only</text>
  <text start="912.86" dur="5.52">they want their way and we can see right</text>
  <text start="916.64" dur="4.38">now there are so many different black</text>
  <text start="918.38" dur="5.88">swans out there that could hit at any</text>
  <text start="921.02" dur="5.58">moment and the Fed the government</text>
  <text start="924.26" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do yes the Fed</text>
  <text start="926.6" dur="3.66">will then step in and they&amp;#39;ll say oh</text>
  <text start="928.43" dur="4.849">don&amp;#39;t worry about it we&amp;#39;ll save the</text>
  <text start="930.26" dur="5.25">economy once again and they&amp;#39;ll start</text>
  <text start="933.279" dur="5.201">creating as much currency as they</text>
  <text start="935.51" dur="5.94">possibly can called stimulus this is</text>
  <text start="938.48" dur="5.28">exactly what they want to do they want</text>
  <text start="941.45" dur="3.93">to lower the interest rates dramatically</text>
  <text start="943.76" dur="2.79">because they realize that that cannot be</text>
  <text start="945.38" dur="3.329">sustained and once they start to</text>
  <text start="946.55" dur="3.45">stimulus up again the debt starts to</text>
  <text start="948.709" dur="5.371">rise very very quickly</text>
  <text start="950" dur="5.85">and remember their objective is to</text>
  <text start="954.08" dur="3.6">control all of this to make sure they</text>
  <text start="955.85" dur="4.71">have the right blame the right narrative</text>
  <text start="957.68" dur="8.399">and this is what they are trying to do</text>
  <text start="960.56" dur="7.35">and this is their entire plan but we can</text>
  <text start="966.079" dur="3.301">see right now there are so many</text>
  <text start="967.91" dur="2.489">different factions or so many things</text>
  <text start="969.38" dur="4.49">happening right now</text>
  <text start="970.399" dur="6.151">that one little thing can go wrong and</text>
  <text start="973.87" dur="5.409">their whole narrative goes down the</text>
  <text start="976.55" dur="5.34">toilet and people point the finger at</text>
  <text start="979.279" dur="4.381">the central bank and there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="981.89" dur="3.689">they can do about it so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="983.66" dur="4.109">trying to do right now is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="985.579" dur="3.901">to maneuver</text>
  <text start="987.769" dur="4.531">in such a way where they can bring the</text>
  <text start="989.48" dur="4.589">economy down on their own terms this is</text>
  <text start="992.3" dur="3">why they&amp;#39;re looking at the interest</text>
  <text start="994.069" dur="3.51">rates this is why they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="995.3" dur="4.289">unwinding because they know once they</text>
  <text start="997.579" dur="3.75">start doing these things this is not</text>
  <text start="999.589" dur="2.761">going to work out for the economy but</text>
  <text start="1001.329" dur="2.7">they can say they&amp;#39;re trying to make the</text>
  <text start="1002.35" dur="4.32">economy better and then point their</text>

  <text start="1006.67" dur="4.56">way we&amp;#39;re looking at this this economy</text>
