  <text start="105.899" dur="5.22">need some type of an event to explain</text>
  <text start="108.869" dur="4.11">why the whole system is coming down of</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="4.89">course they&amp;#39;re never going to expose</text>
  <text start="112.979" dur="6.331">themselves they&amp;#39;re going to say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.009" dur="6.271">because of XYZ during this period of</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="6.229">time we understand that people they have</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="6.44">a very difficult time getting by and</text>
  <text start="125.539" dur="7.121">this is why we&amp;#39;ve seen throughout time</text>
  <text start="128.72" dur="5.97">that people had to resort to not just</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="4.8">one person working to people working</text>
  <text start="134.69" dur="6.49">maybe even two people working having two</text>
  <text start="137.46" dur="5.34">jobs and they still can&amp;#39;t make it then</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="4.53">they had to bring on credit cards think</text>
  <text start="142.8" dur="4.62">about the beginning of when the central</text>
  <text start="145.71" dur="5.43">bank took us off the gold standard and</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="5.97">how things completely changed remember</text>
  <text start="151.14" dur="5.13">when you&amp;#39;re able to buy an automobile</text>
  <text start="153.39" dur="5.28">with cash remember when one person was</text>
  <text start="156.27" dur="5.609">able to work remember when you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="5.149">need credit cards and the dollar was</text>
  <text start="161.879" dur="3.641">actually kind of worth something and</text>
  <text start="163.819" dur="4.511">then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="165.52" dur="5.19">came off that the gold standard and</text>
  <text start="168.33" dur="4.11">everything started to fall apart he</text>
  <text start="170.71" dur="4.14">needed more than one person to work</text>
  <text start="172.44" dur="6.64">maybe two people working with two jobs</text>
  <text start="174.85" dur="5.82">you need a credit cards you needed to</text>
  <text start="179.08" dur="3.08">continually use credit cards and get</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="5.19">additional credit cards</text>
  <text start="182.16" dur="6.73">we went from paying cash for cars to</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="4.83">financing to extending the finance terms</text>
  <text start="188.89" dur="5.1">to leasing to extending the leasing</text>
  <text start="190.69" dur="7.02">terms all of this is happening because</text>
  <text start="193.99" dur="8.28">the entire central bank system is</text>
  <text start="197.71" dur="9.18">falling apart the dollar is continually</text>
  <text start="202.27" dur="7.49">losing value and as it loses value it is</text>
  <text start="206.89" dur="5.82">harder and harder for people to survive</text>
  <text start="209.76" dur="6.25">it come we&amp;#39;re gonna end up at a point</text>
  <text start="212.71" dur="6.57">where the whole system is just going to</text>
  <text start="216.01" dur="4.98">freeze up why because of debt because</text>
  <text start="219.28" dur="4.14">the dollar will be worth absolutely</text>
  <text start="220.99" dur="6.09">nothing and you&amp;#39;ll need a lot more of it</text>
  <text start="223.42" dur="5.91">just to get by it won&amp;#39;t even help that</text>
  <text start="227.08" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s two people working or two people</text>
  <text start="229.33" dur="5.67">working with two jobs the credit cards</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="7.08">won&amp;#39;t even work because you&amp;#39;ll run out</text>
  <text start="235" dur="7.5">of space to add credit then what do you</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="5.43">do this is why they need to restart the</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="5.07">system when I say they I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="244.27" dur="5.28">the central bank system they understand</text>
  <text start="247.57" dur="4.41">that their system only lasts for a</text>
  <text start="249.55" dur="6">particular time they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="251.98" dur="5.52">tell the everyday person the mainstream</text>
  <text start="255.55" dur="4.02">media is not going to tell the everyday</text>
  <text start="257.5" dur="3.78">person because then everyone be looking</text>
  <text start="259.57" dur="4.14">why are we in this system that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="261.28" dur="6.3">make sense and you can see right now</text>
  <text start="263.71" dur="5.33">that the system is struggling think</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="5.43">about this for a second</text>
  <text start="269.04" dur="6.91">something isn&amp;#39;t right the Fed cut rates</text>
  <text start="273.01" dur="6.03">and we can see the Fed is going to cut</text>
  <text start="275.95" dur="6.87">rates again we see there&amp;#39;s negative</text>
  <text start="279.04" dur="5.58">rates in Europe but US credit card</text>
  <text start="282.82" dur="5.12">interest rates have soared to the</text>
  <text start="284.62" dur="6.39">highest since 2001 why</text>
  <text start="287.94" dur="6.76">and despite credit card rates being an</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="6.36">18-year high u.s. revolving debt largely</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="4.77">made up of credit card debt has exploded</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="8.4">in July to as high as</text>
  <text start="299.47" dur="11.46">on record why because people need to use</text>
  <text start="305.77" dur="9.06">credit to purchase goods many people out</text>
  <text start="310.93" dur="9.66">there they don&amp;#39;t have enough cash to</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="8.61">purchase goods they rely on credit think</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="6.57">about it if we stripped away all credit</text>
  <text start="323.44" dur="6.96">cards this would be a disaster for the</text>
  <text start="327.16" dur="5.31">United States the majority of people</text>
  <text start="330.4" dur="5.49">would not be able to survive</text>
  <text start="332.47" dur="6.12">then strip away automobile loans student</text>
  <text start="335.89" dur="7.17">loans everything that has to do with</text>
  <text start="338.59" dur="6.75">credit if you had to survive on the</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="6.42">dollar and what you have in your bank</text>
  <text start="345.34" dur="5.82">account how many people could on the way</text>
  <text start="349.48" dur="4.25">they are living they would have to</text>
  <text start="351.16" dur="6.12">really change the way they were living</text>
  <text start="353.73" dur="6.82">what would that look like would that</text>
  <text start="357.28" dur="5.97">look like the us that we know or would</text>
  <text start="360.55" dur="6.39">it look completely different this is why</text>
  <text start="363.25" dur="8.01">all of this has been introduced because</text>
  <text start="366.94" dur="7.8">they know their system was never going</text>
  <text start="371.26" dur="6.96">to allow the people to survive if they</text>
  <text start="374.74" dur="8.84">just used cash this is why they needed</text>
  <text start="378.22" dur="7.41">to introduce credit introduced loans and</text>
  <text start="383.58" dur="5.98">continually do this this is why they</text>
  <text start="385.63" dur="6.96">created the credit score we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="389.56" dur="5.97">any of this if we were out of a central</text>
  <text start="392.59" dur="7.71">bank system and we were in a sound money</text>
  <text start="395.53" dur="6.48">system why would we need credit yes</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="3.78">there might be times where we say okay</text>
  <text start="402.01" dur="4.86">listen I used up all my cash</text>
  <text start="404.08" dur="4.47">I need credit to get by but the everyday</text>
  <text start="406.87" dur="5.4">person just to survive</text>
  <text start="408.55" dur="4.86">they wouldn&amp;#39;t need credit and you</text>
  <text start="412.27" dur="5.1">probably wouldn&amp;#39;t need credit to</text>
  <text start="413.41" dur="7.89">purchase a car maybe a home maybe maybe</text>
  <text start="417.37" dur="8.04">not but otherwise to live your everyday</text>
  <text start="421.3" dur="5.43">life to go out shopping to buy food you</text>
  <text start="425.41" dur="3.06">wouldn&amp;#39;t need it actually if you Swit</text>
  <text start="426.73" dur="4.47">though if you stripped away credit right</text>
  <text start="428.47" dur="4.05">now the US would look like a third-world</text>
  <text start="431.2" dur="3.51">nation</text>
  <text start="432.52" dur="4.98">people would not be able to survive it</text>
  <text start="434.71" dur="4.41">would be a disaster and this is why Q is</text>
  <text start="437.5" dur="3.12">told us that gold is going to destroy</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="4.62">the Fed the Fed is going to be</text>
  <text start="440.62" dur="4.549">restructured the entire system is going</text>
  <text start="443.74" dur="5.1">to be restructured</text>
  <text start="445.169" dur="7">already we have citigroup out there they</text>
  <text start="448.84" dur="5.88">released an analyst note and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.169" dur="6.211">expecting gold prices to trade stronger</text>
  <text start="454.72" dur="7.47">for longer possibly breaching 2,000 and</text>
  <text start="458.38" dur="7.59">and posting new cyclical highs at some</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="6.21">point in the next year or two now i know</text>
  <text start="465.97" dur="4.5">that gold is down today don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="468.4" dur="4.5">about gold bobbing up and down</text>
  <text start="470.47" dur="4.199">you&amp;#39;re not buying it then selling it</text>
  <text start="472.9" dur="4.04">buying it then selling it trying to make</text>
  <text start="474.669" dur="6.271">a profit that&amp;#39;s not the purpose of gold</text>
  <text start="476.94" dur="5.62">think about China Russia and many of the</text>
  <text start="480.94" dur="3.75">countries out there are they out there</text>
  <text start="482.56" dur="5.16">buying it selling it no when the price</text>
  <text start="484.69" dur="5.909">goes down like this this is an indicator</text>
  <text start="487.72" dur="3.65">that it&amp;#39;s on sale if I told you that hey</text>
  <text start="490.599" dur="4.051">look</text>
  <text start="491.37" dur="4.72">see these television sets they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="3.989">thousand dollars apiece</text>
  <text start="496.09" dur="5.46">but today they dropped to eight hundred</text>
  <text start="498.639" dur="5.641">or seven hundred what would you do you</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="4.5">would go out and you purchase the TV now</text>
  <text start="504.28" dur="5.669">what&amp;#39;s really the TV worth absolutely</text>
  <text start="506.05" dur="7.14">nothing when gold loses value people</text>
  <text start="509.949" dur="5.611">freak out and they sell it no it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="513.19" dur="4.8">same as a TV but gold is worth something</text>
  <text start="515.56" dur="5.46">as the price comes down it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="517.99" dur="4.95">indicator letting you know right now for</text>
  <text start="521.02" dur="6.629">this very short period of time it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="522.94" dur="8.88">sale you can get a lot more gold with</text>
  <text start="527.649" dur="8.371">that paper currency so do it because</text>
  <text start="531.82" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;re expecting gold to move back up but</text>
  <text start="536.02" dur="5.49">everyone looks at it and says I must get</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="6.93">out of it today no it&amp;#39;s an insurance</text>
  <text start="541.51" dur="6.42">policy and gold this is something we</text>
  <text start="545.8" dur="6">need to watch because gold is going to</text>
  <text start="547.93" dur="8.67">take off like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="551.8" dur="8.34">and once Trump and the Patriots start</text>
  <text start="556.6" dur="6.69">transitioning us into this new economic</text>
  <text start="560.14" dur="5.76">system it is going to be way too late</text>
  <text start="563.29" dur="5.01">for most people</text>
  <text start="565.9" dur="3.74">now think about what the central bank</text>
  <text start="568.3" dur="4.32">has done in the past</text>
  <text start="569.64" dur="9.55">remember back in 2011 gold started to</text>
  <text start="572.62" dur="11.07">rise it hit 1500 1600 1700 1800 from</text>
  <text start="579.19" dur="6.63">April through August of that year and it</text>
  <text start="583.69" dur="6.089">hit nineteen hundred and change on</text>
  <text start="585.82" dur="7.11">August 23rd 2011 and then it was brought</text>
  <text start="589.779" dur="7.941">back down and the following five years</text>
  <text start="592.93" dur="10.98">it stayed at 1100 remember they never</text>
  <text start="597.72" dur="9.04">expected Trump to win they thought by</text>
  <text start="603.91" dur="5.369">holding the gold price down no one would</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="5.18">realize what was going on that it was</text>
  <text start="609.279" dur="5.511">the central bank that was the problem</text>
  <text start="611.94" dur="7.72">they were going to have their event</text>
  <text start="614.79" dur="6.46">since Trump has won that entire plan is</text>
  <text start="619.66" dur="5.91">out the window</text>
  <text start="621.25" dur="6.87">all of a sudden we went from 1,100 up to</text>
  <text start="625.57" dur="5.7">1500 yes when he got elected it was</text>
  <text start="628.12" dur="6.99">around 12 and change 1300 but we&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="631.27" dur="5.67">up to 1550 yes it&amp;#39;s going to come down a</text>
  <text start="635.11" dur="4.32">little bit it&amp;#39;s gonna bob up and down</text>
  <text start="636.94" dur="5.67">but when we look back in time you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="639.43" dur="6.42">gonna watch it move up every single time</text>
  <text start="642.61" dur="5.88">and every single time you see the gold</text>
  <text start="645.85" dur="4.89">price dip like this this is my personal</text>
  <text start="648.49" dur="5.25">opinion this is what I do you purchase</text>
  <text start="650.74" dur="7.289">more if you can&amp;#39;t afford gold purchase</text>
  <text start="653.74" dur="6.03">silver and once again this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="658.029" dur="3.81">watching because gold is going to be the</text>
  <text start="659.77" dur="5.91">indicator when it hits 2000 when it hits</text>
  <text start="661.839" dur="8.101">2500 this is letting you know that the</text>
  <text start="665.68" dur="7.95">central bank Fiat system is dying every</text>
  <text start="669.94" dur="6.51">time gold moves up that means the</text>
  <text start="673.63" dur="6.18">central bank fiat system is dying a</text>
  <text start="676.45" dur="4.98">little bit more and people when gold</text>
  <text start="679.81" dur="2.969">hits a certain price and people start to</text>
  <text start="681.43" dur="4.83">realize what&amp;#39;s going on the everyday</text>
  <text start="682.779" dur="5.871">person starts to realize this everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.26" dur="5.55">going to make a mad rush to gold</text>
  <text start="688.65" dur="6.09">which means the central bank Fiat system</text>
  <text start="691.81" dur="4.11">is going to completely implode on itself</text>
  <text start="694.74" dur="5.159">this</text>
  <text start="695.92" dur="6.84">system is going to die no matter what</text>
  <text start="699.899" dur="4.901">the Patriots now are in control to</text>
  <text start="702.76" dur="4.319">transition us out of this system</text>
  <text start="704.8" dur="5.52">just like the central bankers the deeps</text>
  <text start="707.079" dur="7.741">they transitioned us from a somewhat</text>
  <text start="710.32" dur="5.069">gold back system prior to 71 into a Fiat</text>
  <text start="714.82" dur="2.28">system</text>
  <text start="715.389" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;re just reversing everything right</text>
  <text start="717.1" dur="6.84">now and Q has told us that gold is going</text>
  <text start="721.449" dur="6.211">to destroy the Fed and we&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="723.94" dur="6.06">gold continually move up and this is</text>
  <text start="727.66" dur="4.289">what we need to watch because there are</text>
  <text start="730" dur="4.56">certain levels that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
