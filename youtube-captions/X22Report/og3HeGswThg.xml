  <text start="61.19" dur="4.929">2017 and thought of the episode is the</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="3.96">IMF is pushing the media to play up</text>
  <text start="66.119" dur="5.371">their warning about the collapsing</text>
  <text start="68.13" dur="7.349">economy let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.49" dur="5.58">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="4.82">starting to hear from many different</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="5.82">financial puniness economists that the</text>
  <text start="80.299" dur="6.311">economy around the world the global</text>
  <text start="82.89" dur="5.64">economy is not doing very well and we</text>
  <text start="86.61" dur="4.11">understand that the central banks they</text>
  <text start="88.53" dur="4.379">have been pushing their agenda by</text>
  <text start="90.72" dur="5.13">creating a lot of currency keeping the</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="6.39">interest rates very low and they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="95.85" dur="7.53">all they possibly can to keep us in this</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="6.27">illusion but it&amp;#39;s breaking apart and we</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="4.529">can see that there is a German financial</text>
  <text start="105.569" dur="4.681">analyst mark Friedrich he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="107.909" dur="4.32">saying that listen the European Central</text>
  <text start="110.25" dur="4.619">Bank if they can if they continue to</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="4.861">keep its monetary policy unchanged the</text>
  <text start="114.869" dur="5.28">way they&amp;#39;re doing right now it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="6.149">to be disastrous keeping the interest</text>
  <text start="120.149" dur="6.181">rate at 0% and pumping money into the</text>
  <text start="123.239" dur="4.921">economy would only further delay of a</text>
  <text start="126.33" dur="5.489">collapse of the European financial</text>
  <text start="128.16" dur="5.49">system and we see right now that this is</text>
  <text start="131.819" dur="4.441">all the central banks are doing right</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="4.68">now because they cannot do much of</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="4.11">anything else they can&amp;#39;t really raise</text>
  <text start="138.33" dur="4.59">interest rates they can&amp;#39;t lower interest</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="4.68">rates further all they can do is create</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="5.91">currency keep everything the way it is</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="6.57">unchanged and hopefully they can blame</text>
  <text start="148.83" dur="5.76">this entire collapse of the system on</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="5.43">someone else now he&amp;#39;s out there saying</text>
  <text start="154.59" dur="4.289">that the current policy is expensive as</text>
  <text start="157.05" dur="4.35">the central bank is trying to buy time</text>
  <text start="158.879" dur="4.591">to keep the money carousel going and all</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="4.71">at the expense of the people and</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="4.349">according to Friedrich the central bank</text>
  <text start="166.11" dur="3.93">should have ended its QE program by</text>
  <text start="167.819" dur="4.59">December 2017 but as we know they</text>
  <text start="170.04" dur="4.38">extended it to 2018 because if they stop</text>
  <text start="172.409" dur="4.08">it guess what happens the whole thing</text>
  <text start="174.42" dur="4.86">just completely falls apart and this is</text>
  <text start="176.489" dur="5.22">what we&amp;#39;re seeing now Friedrich is out</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="4.439">there saying listen there will be an</text>
  <text start="181.709" dur="4.201">extra two hundred and seventy billion</text>
  <text start="183.719" dur="4.441">euros and then two trillion</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="3.84">and we all will be responsible for that</text>
  <text start="188.16" dur="4.2">the ECB is getting more and more</text>
  <text start="189.75" dur="5.19">reckless and this only delays a collapse</text>
  <text start="192.36" dur="3.99">first of all an attempt to save southern</text>
  <text start="194.94" dur="3.69">your countries including Italy</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="4.2">I see no good in this policy the</text>
  <text start="198.63" dur="3.69">interest rate remains zero and will</text>
  <text start="200.55" dur="4.68">remain at this level in the future</text>
  <text start="202.32" dur="5.07">he also underscored the economic growth</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="3.9">is still sluggish across the European</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="4.35">Union and it doesn&amp;#39;t look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.13" dur="4.08">going to get any better now we</text>
  <text start="211.74" dur="4.11">understand this we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="213.21" dur="4.47">this for a very long time other people</text>
  <text start="215.85" dur="4.05">now are coming out and saying yeah</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="4.26">everything they&amp;#39;ve done really hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="219.9" dur="4.71">done pretty much of anything except keep</text>
  <text start="221.94" dur="4.59">us in this illusion now most of the</text>
  <text start="224.61" dur="5.76">public right now here in the United</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="5.34">States they think everything is doing ok</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="4.02">they think everything&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="231.87" dur="5.82">everything&amp;#39;s perfect and right now we</text>
  <text start="234.39" dur="6.18">can see American consumers well their</text>
  <text start="237.69" dur="6.65">optimism their confidence is at the</text>
  <text start="240.57" dur="8.58">highest point since the dot-com bubble</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="9.28">now this is back in 99 2000 going into</text>
  <text start="249.15" dur="8.3">2001 now the dot-com bubble was much</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="7.32">higher than it was back in 2008</text>
  <text start="257.45" dur="6.73">2007-2008 and we&amp;#39;re reaching the same</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="5.82">exact point and people really do believe</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="5.16">that everything is going to be ok but</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="5.22">there is one little hitch to this whole</text>
  <text start="269.34" dur="4.95">thing is that they don&amp;#39;t feel the job</text>
  <text start="271.98" dur="3.84">market is as strong as it should be now</text>
  <text start="274.29" dur="3.629">of course they&amp;#39;re out there telling you</text>
  <text start="275.82" dur="4.47">that it&amp;#39;s low 4.2% or something like</text>
  <text start="277.919" dur="3.361">that and this is kind of strange that</text>
  <text start="280.29" dur="3.54">the people think that the job market</text>
  <text start="281.28" dur="4.74">isn&amp;#39;t strong well there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="3.45">realizing this because when they lose a</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="3.42">job or they&amp;#39;re trying to find a</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="3.75">different job they can&amp;#39;t find the same</text>
  <text start="289.44" dur="3.42">pay they can&amp;#39;t find the same job and</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="3.6">many people have lost their job they</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="3.48">only can find part-time jobs this is why</text>
  <text start="294.63" dur="4.92">this is a huge problem</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="5.25">now why while they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="299.55" dur="5.63">everyone is completely confident in the</text>
  <text start="301.59" dur="6.03">economy we see retail it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="4.57">deteriorating stores are closing people</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="4.02">are losing jobs corporations their</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="4.71">revenues are terrible look at Under</text>
  <text start="311.64" dur="5.07">Armour right now down 75 percent from</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="4.86">their highs and they&amp;#39;re cutting their</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="6.36">outlook why because their revenue</text>
  <text start="319.32" dur="6.03">has dipped by 4% and this is the first</text>
  <text start="323.07" dur="5.19">decline in revenue since it floated in</text>
  <text start="325.35" dur="5.31">2005 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="328.26" dur="5.67">that it&amp;#39;s starting to hit all these</text>
  <text start="330.66" dur="4.92">corporations none of these buybacks and</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="5.28">none of these things they can do will</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="4.95">ever mask the revenue the sales that</text>
  <text start="339.21" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re bringing in because you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="4.38">really fake that because revenue sales</text>
  <text start="343.74" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s all there is</text>
  <text start="344.91" dur="4.47">earnings you can fake and it looks like</text>
  <text start="347.07" dur="5.04">a lot of these companies there is a huge</text>
  <text start="349.38" dur="4.83">amount of problems and they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="4.65">to report that yet sales aren&amp;#39;t what</text>
  <text start="354.21" dur="5.58">they seem and a lot of companies are out</text>
  <text start="356.76" dur="4.68">there saying that sales aren&amp;#39;t good and</text>
  <text start="359.79" dur="2.73">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of stores doing this</text>
  <text start="361.44" dur="4.71">and this is why they&amp;#39;re going bankrupt</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="7.05">we see the Chicago PMI and now this is</text>
  <text start="366.15" dur="5.04">the Chicago PMI survey it is surged like</text>
  <text start="369.57" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before now this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="371.19" dur="3.96">mean this is the hard data we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="373.44" dur="3.09">this before this is an estimate and</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="4.02">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="376.53" dur="4.95">estimate is that employment fell and the</text>
  <text start="379.17" dur="5.16">direction reversed and it signals a</text>
  <text start="381.48" dur="4.71">contraction so the hard data is going to</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="4.23">probably most likely show the opposite</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="3.59">of what the survey is showing now we</text>
  <text start="388.56" dur="4.05">know that the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="389.78" dur="5.26">they&amp;#39;re going to be unveiling a huge tax</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="5.52">reform plan and if we look at the</text>
  <text start="395.04" dur="5.43">details of the plan we see that the</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="4.77">focus of the entire thing the whole tax</text>
  <text start="400.47" dur="4.23">reform is on corporate tax reform with</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="4.26">the notion that an employer will somehow</text>
  <text start="404.7" dur="4.5">pass on their savings to employees via</text>
  <text start="407.16" dur="3.96">raises we know that&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="409.2" dur="3.48">happen first off while the phrase</text>
  <text start="411.12" dur="4.62">corporate taxes is a great political</text>
  <text start="412.68" dur="5.76">prop the reality is that nearly 50% of</text>
  <text start="415.74" dur="5.97">large corporations pay zero corporate</text>
  <text start="418.44" dur="5.28">income tax in 2012 the Government</text>
  <text start="421.71" dur="4.14">Accountability Office performed a study</text>
  <text start="423.72" dur="5.25">in which it discovered that 43% of</text>
  <text start="425.85" dur="7.34">companies with 10 plus 10 million plus</text>
  <text start="428.97" dur="7.77">in assets pay zero corporate income tax</text>
  <text start="433.19" dur="5.5">it&amp;#39;s not as if the other 57% are picking</text>
  <text start="436.74" dur="3.63">up the slack either it is well known</text>
  <text start="438.69" dur="3.78">that the large corporations go above and</text>
  <text start="440.37" dur="6.03">beyond to avoid paying the full required</text>
  <text start="442.47" dur="5.22">tax rate why are they giving a tax break</text>
  <text start="446.4" dur="3.21">to corporations</text>
  <text start="447.69" dur="4.77">why aren&amp;#39;t they giving it to the</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="5.79">everyday person well</text>
  <text start="452.46" dur="4.41">this would be a problem if they started</text>
  <text start="455.4" dur="3.269">the discussion about individual tax</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="3.21">reform because that eventually leads to</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="3.571">the elephant in the room and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.08" dur="3.839">entitlements that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re staying</text>
  <text start="462.24" dur="4.2">away from this the other reason I</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="4.981">believe they&amp;#39;re going after the pushing</text>
  <text start="466.44" dur="5.129">the corporate tax reform is because when</text>
  <text start="468.9" dur="4.169">the system falls apart they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="471.569" dur="3.061">need to help the corporations because</text>
  <text start="473.069" dur="3.72">most of these corporations are gonna</text>
  <text start="474.63" dur="4.849">completely collapse under the weight of</text>
  <text start="476.789" dur="5.761">the economy breaking down because their</text>
  <text start="479.479" dur="5.021">sales they won&amp;#39;t be there their earnings</text>
  <text start="482.55" dur="4.649">and their buybacks that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="484.5" dur="4.229">doing the fake accounting data that</text>
  <text start="487.199" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;ve been putting out there it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="488.729" dur="3.66">going to hit them and it looks like what</text>
  <text start="491.039" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="492.389" dur="5.611">to create this bailout type of program</text>
  <text start="495.81" dur="3.09">that will eventually help the</text>
  <text start="498" dur="3.3">corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.9" dur="3.989">when the entire system falls apart and</text>
  <text start="501.3" dur="4.619">it looks like that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="502.889" dur="4.71">to do at this point now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="505.919" dur="3.571">currently spends around 65 percent of</text>
  <text start="507.599" dur="3.81">its budget on entitlement spending this</text>
  <text start="509.49" dur="4.979">is why then how can I mention anything</text>
  <text start="511.409" dur="4.711">about individual tax reform that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="514.469" dur="3.781">they&amp;#39;re going after their corporations</text>
  <text start="516.12" dur="4.44">and there&amp;#39;s other reasons nearly half of</text>
  <text start="518.25" dur="4.649">American households receive some kind of</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="5.1">government assistance today those</text>
  <text start="522.899" dur="6.75">households that do pay taxes cover only</text>
  <text start="525.66" dur="6.63">some of this and the other comes from</text>
  <text start="529.649" dur="4.951">the borrowing of a government where they</text>
  <text start="532.29" dur="4.71">borrow money from the Fed and we see</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="4.2">right now that at this point the tax</text>
  <text start="537" dur="3.779">receipts coming into the government is</text>
  <text start="538.8" dur="3.33">not even enough to pay for the state if</text>
  <text start="540.779" dur="4.111">the interest rates move up just a little</text>
  <text start="542.13" dur="4.47">bit the whole thing just completely</text>
  <text start="544.89" dur="4.56">comes tumbling down they will not be</text>
  <text start="546.6" dur="5.58">able to pay for anything out in China we</text>
  <text start="549.45" dur="6.15">see the Chinese yield curve has now in</text>
  <text start="552.18" dur="5.96">been inverted for ten straight days is</text>
  <text start="555.6" dur="6.66">the longest period of inversion ever and</text>
  <text start="558.14" dur="7.99">this is a warning that something bad is</text>
  <text start="562.26" dur="6.319">headed our way and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing a</text>
  <text start="566.13" dur="4.68">lot of this now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="568.579" dur="6.07">and we mentioned this a couple reports</text>
  <text start="570.81" dur="6.39">ago the IMF came out with their global</text>
  <text start="574.649" dur="6.241">financial crash scenario and they</text>
  <text start="577.2" dur="4.98">highlighted a certain area where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.89" dur="4.23">going to be problems and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="582.18" dur="4.02">predicting some type of collapse in the</text>
  <text start="585.12" dur="4.23">system</text>
  <text start="586.2" dur="5.7">this week the IMF has gone a step</text>
  <text start="589.35" dur="4.29">further what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="591.9" dur="4.95">going to the mainstream financial media</text>
  <text start="593.64" dur="4.8">to publicize its warning about the</text>
  <text start="596.85" dur="3.99">danger of historically low volatility</text>
  <text start="598.44" dur="5.61">and related short volatility strategies</text>
  <text start="600.84" dur="5.01">and what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.05" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re wanting the the</text>
  <text start="605.85" dur="5.22">corporate media to push the idea that</text>
  <text start="608.73" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re going to have problems in the</text>
  <text start="611.07" dur="4.65">future and this is exactly what is going</text>
  <text start="614.22" dur="4.65">to happen and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="5.34">broadcasting all of this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="618.87" dur="3.84">letting everyone know that yes we</text>
  <text start="621.06" dur="3.66">understand that the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="622.71" dur="4.29">as well as we thought we understand that</text>
  <text start="624.72" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re heading for this global crisis and</text>
  <text start="627" dur="3.78">we want everyone to know about it now</text>
  <text start="629.1" dur="3.9">the question is why are they doing this</text>
  <text start="630.78" dur="4.08">why do they want the corporate media out</text>
  <text start="633" dur="3.21">there pushing this because again what</text>
  <text start="634.86" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="636.21" dur="4.11">try to blame another group another</text>
  <text start="638.19" dur="3.66">person they don&amp;#39;t want the blame for it</text>
  <text start="640.32" dur="2.88">so if they come out with their warning</text>
  <text start="641.85" dur="3.54">the corporate media as we can see as</text>
  <text start="643.2" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="645.39" dur="4.74">talking about the stock market how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.91" dur="4.62">overvalued that something might go wrong</text>
  <text start="650.13" dur="4.59">there black swans they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="652.53" dur="2.91">how the economy isn&amp;#39;t as strong as we</text>
  <text start="654.72" dur="3.72">all think</text>
  <text start="655.44" dur="5.55">and now the IMF is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="658.44" dur="4.71">courting the media to push that agenda</text>
  <text start="660.99" dur="5.28">and they&amp;#39;re doing this on purpose</text>
  <text start="663.15" dur="5.73">because they want this information out</text>
  <text start="666.27" dur="5.7">there because the central banks they</text>
  <text start="668.88" dur="5.79">always have a plan I mean we hear all</text>
  <text start="671.97" dur="4.89">this talk about you know cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="674.67" dur="4.2">and how Christine Lagarde is all for</text>
  <text start="676.86" dur="4.77">Bitcoin and how they like the</text>
  <text start="678.87" dur="5.34">cryptocurrency well think about it the</text>
  <text start="681.63" dur="5.01">central bankers they&amp;#39;d been dying for a</text>
  <text start="684.21" dur="4.05">digital currency they don&amp;#39;t want cash I</text>
  <text start="686.64" dur="3.54">mean right now they do have a digital</text>
  <text start="688.26" dur="4.02">currency but it&amp;#39;s also in cash they</text>
  <text start="690.18" dur="4.47">would like to get cash out of the</text>
  <text start="692.28" dur="4.08">picture why because this way they can</text>
  <text start="694.65" dur="4.26">control everything if they move to</text>
  <text start="696.36" dur="3.9">cryptocurrency they have full control</text>
  <text start="698.91" dur="3">now people say well this is</text>
  <text start="700.26" dur="3.6">decentralized why would they push a</text>
  <text start="701.91" dur="4.05">decentralized system no they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="703.86" dur="4.59">pushing Bitcoin by itself they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="705.96" dur="3.81">pushing like coin or dash or any of that</text>
  <text start="708.45" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re not trying to take control the</text>
  <text start="709.77" dur="4.46">entire blockchain system what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="711.84" dur="6.15">trying to do just like they did back in</text>
  <text start="714.23" dur="5.539">1913 and even before this they want</text>
  <text start="717.99" dur="4.449">control of the creation</text>
  <text start="719.769" dur="7.38">currency they want the government&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="722.439" dur="8.34">sign on to a coin that the central</text>
  <text start="727.149" dur="6.72">bank&amp;#39;s control yes there might be other</text>
  <text start="730.779" dur="4.771">cryptocurrencies out there but just like</text>
  <text start="733.869" dur="5.07">today there&amp;#39;s gold or silver there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="735.55" dur="4.769">cryptocurrency but the only currency</text>
  <text start="738.939" dur="3.12">that can be used here in the United</text>
  <text start="740.319" dur="3.031">States is the dollar and many of the</text>
  <text start="742.059" dur="3.12">countries have their own currencies</text>
  <text start="743.35" dur="3.779">where the private western central banks</text>
  <text start="745.179" dur="5.64">control it just like in Europe there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="747.129" dur="6.15">the euro and they want you to use this</text>
  <text start="750.819" dur="3.48">because again this is how they make</text>
  <text start="753.279" dur="4.831">their money because the government</text>
  <text start="754.299" dur="6.181">borrows from the central banks and the</text>
  <text start="758.11" dur="4.409">people have to pay the interest on the</text>
  <text start="760.48" dur="4.049">borrowing and this is where taxes come</text>
  <text start="762.519" dur="6.12">in so what they really want to do is</text>
  <text start="764.529" dur="5.46">they want to create a coin and they want</text>
  <text start="768.639" dur="3.151">government and this is their gonna be</text>
  <text start="769.989" dur="4.681">their next step they&amp;#39;re gonna want them</text>
  <text start="771.79" dur="6.959">to pass laws saying this is the official</text>
  <text start="774.67" dur="6.24">currency of the country and each country</text>
  <text start="778.749" dur="5.161">most likely is going to be forced to do</text>
  <text start="780.91" dur="5.669">this now is this going to work we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="783.91" dur="5.789">know and if the central banks get</text>
  <text start="786.579" dur="5.31">control of this and force us to use this</text>
  <text start="789.699" dur="3.48">coin guess what they&amp;#39;re going to create</text>
  <text start="791.889" dur="3.601">this out of thin air</text>
  <text start="793.179" dur="4.89">loan it to the government and the people</text>
  <text start="795.49" dur="3.99">will then use this digital currency yes</text>
  <text start="798.069" dur="3.2">it will be decentralized they&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="799.48" dur="4.579">their servers all over the place and</text>
  <text start="801.269" dur="6.1">once again will be under their control</text>
  <text start="804.059" dur="5.051">now on the other hand we need to say</text>
  <text start="807.369" dur="4.83">listen we don&amp;#39;t even need you why would</text>
  <text start="809.11" dur="4.949">we need a central bank to create a</text>
  <text start="812.199" dur="4.38">currency when it&amp;#39;s already been creating</text>
  <text start="814.059" dur="5.851">on its own so what we need to do at this</text>
  <text start="816.579" dur="5.161">point is we need once the system starts</text>
  <text start="819.91" dur="3.69">to reset once we go through this</text>
  <text start="821.74" dur="4.98">collapse scenario which they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="823.6" dur="5.25">calling for we need to push the idea</text>
  <text start="826.72" dur="4.369">that we don&amp;#39;t need the central bank and</text>
  <text start="828.85" dur="6.029">the only way to do this is for</text>
  <text start="831.089" dur="5.92">businesses to start accepting Bitcoin -</text>
  <text start="834.879" dur="4.29">litecoin whatever cryptocurrency it is</text>
  <text start="837.009" dur="5.16">they need to accept it people need to be</text>
  <text start="839.169" dur="5.46">paid in this cryptocurrency and we will</text>
  <text start="842.169" dur="5.25">then bypass everything the central bank</text>
  <text start="844.629" dur="6.5">is doing and they can&amp;#39;t tax this money</text>
  <text start="847.419" dur="5.79">because it&amp;#39;s not a Federal Reserve Note</text>
  <text start="851.129" dur="5.8">we&amp;#39;re dealing in a</text>
  <text start="853.209" dur="5.341">lately separate currency and I believe</text>
  <text start="856.929" dur="3.361">this is the direction that the people</text>
  <text start="858.55" dur="3.69">need to go and now the central bank</text>
  <text start="860.29" dur="3.329">doesn&amp;#39;t want this to happen there were</text>
  <text start="862.24" dur="3.509">there were a little bit late to the</text>
  <text start="863.619" dur="3.871">internet where the Cabal the</text>
  <text start="865.749" dur="3.661">establishment they thought it was a joke</text>
  <text start="867.49" dur="3.75">social media was a joke they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="869.41" dur="3.45">realize how powerful it was going to get</text>
  <text start="871.24" dur="2.969">because they thought they owned the</text>
  <text start="872.86" dur="2.49">corporate media you know the five</text>
  <text start="874.209" dur="3.06">different company or seven different</text>
  <text start="875.35" dur="3.239">companies and they just passed around</text>
  <text start="877.269" dur="3.271">the same exact story to all these</text>
  <text start="878.589" dur="3.271">different areas and they thought the</text>
  <text start="880.54" dur="3.57">Internet that&amp;#39;s not going to do anything</text>
  <text start="881.86" dur="3.959">well they learn their lesson they</text>
  <text start="884.11" dur="4.259">realized that they should have got into</text>
  <text start="885.819" dur="4.05">this way ahead of time and controlled</text>
  <text start="888.369" dur="3.27">the Internet and they wouldn&amp;#39;t be having</text>
  <text start="889.869" dur="3.45">this problem today so they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="891.639" dur="3.721">cryptocurrency we know it&amp;#39;s not that big</text>
  <text start="893.319" dur="4.531">and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="895.36" dur="4.62">trying to get on board before everyone</text>
  <text start="897.85" dur="3.81">starts to realize what cryptocurrency is</text>
  <text start="899.98" dur="3.06">because a lot of people don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="901.66" dur="4.2">it is a lot of people don&amp;#39;t own it and</text>
  <text start="903.04" dur="5.099">they&amp;#39;re trying to create and pass laws</text>
  <text start="905.86" dur="3.569">right now where they can control it now</text>
  <text start="908.139" dur="3.271">I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s going to work</text>
  <text start="909.429" dur="4.14">hopefully it doesn&amp;#39;t hopefully the</text>
  <text start="911.41" dur="4.08">people say no hopefully those people in</text>
  <text start="913.569" dur="3.421">the crypto market say we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="915.49" dur="4.079">central bank there&amp;#39;s no reason for it</text>
  <text start="916.99" dur="4.529">but again we have our government idiots</text>
  <text start="919.569" dur="4.56">who might go along with it because</text>
  <text start="921.519" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;ll be paid off somehow someway but</text>
  <text start="924.129" dur="4.531">we can see as we go through this major</text>
  <text start="926.679" dur="3.69">collapse scenario the IMF is already</text>
  <text start="928.66" dur="3.81">pushing it out there we already know</text>
  <text start="930.369" dur="4.44">because we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it we need</text>
  <text start="932.47" dur="3.989">to make a decision at a certain point in</text>
  <text start="934.809" dur="3.12">time because there will be every set</text>
