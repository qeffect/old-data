  <text start="66.88" dur="6.15">taken down let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="69.91" dur="5.1">collapse financial news now since Trump</text>
  <text start="73.03" dur="3.75">has been out there contradicting the Fed</text>
  <text start="75.01" dur="4.86">you can see it all over the news the</text>
  <text start="76.78" dur="4.8">mainstream media where now the central</text>
  <text start="79.87" dur="4.17">banks like the IMF the biz the</text>
  <text start="81.58" dur="6">mainstream media everyone is taking</text>
  <text start="84.04" dur="6">sides and this is part of the plan now</text>
  <text start="87.58" dur="5.1">when this system starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="90.04" dur="4.05">and really start to fall apart where the</text>
  <text start="92.68" dur="3.03">manipulation is not going to do anything</text>
  <text start="94.09" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re going to notice a lot of different</text>
  <text start="95.71" dur="6.24">changes happening I mean yes we saw the</text>
  <text start="98.47" dur="6.92">market come down a little bit we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="101.95" dur="5.85">it pushed up again but when we see gold</text>
  <text start="105.39" dur="4.6">start to move up and we don&amp;#39;t see the</text>
  <text start="107.8" dur="3.99">central bank slamming it down with paper</text>
  <text start="109.99" dur="3.78">contracts where they try to slam it down</text>
  <text start="111.79" dur="4.2">with paper contracts but they cannot</text>
  <text start="113.77" dur="6.56">bring down the price and gold keeps</text>
  <text start="115.99" dur="8.13">moving up then you know something is up</text>
  <text start="120.33" dur="5.41">yes gold has moved up a little bit but</text>
  <text start="124.12" dur="4.71">once again if it starts to move up and</text>
  <text start="125.74" dur="5.969">move up and the central bank comes in</text>
  <text start="128.83" dur="4.5">and throws paper contracts at it and it</text>
  <text start="131.709" dur="3.871">doesn&amp;#39;t go down maybe just a couple</text>
  <text start="133.33" dur="4.2">dollars and it continually moves up you</text>
  <text start="135.58" dur="4.26">know something is up right there and</text>
  <text start="137.53" dur="4.47">then now Goldman Sachs and Bank of</text>
  <text start="139.84" dur="5.69">America they&amp;#39;re out there saying that</text>
  <text start="142" dur="8.25">yeah we think gold could climb to over</text>
  <text start="145.53" dur="7.39">$1300 per ounce now when we see the</text>
  <text start="150.25" dur="4.59">central bank lose complete manipulation</text>
  <text start="152.92" dur="4.74">and the economy completely implodes on</text>
  <text start="154.84" dur="6.6">itself you&amp;#39;re gonna see gold not move up</text>
  <text start="157.66" dur="8.49">above 1,300 1,400 1,500 you&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="161.44" dur="6.84">it go to 3,000 4,000 5,000 7,000 so this</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="3.99">is something to watch and we can see</text>
  <text start="168.28" dur="3.06">that gold has moved up a little bit if</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="3.93">you notice when the market comes down</text>
  <text start="171.34" dur="4.86">people get nervous and afraid and they</text>
  <text start="174.07" dur="4.83">go into assets that they know will</text>
  <text start="176.2" dur="5.16">protect their wealth and gold has moved</text>
  <text start="178.9" dur="4.68">up a little bit but is this the big one</text>
  <text start="181.36" dur="6.48">no I don&amp;#39;t think so as of yet but you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="183.58" dur="7.829">notice the changes in gold</text>
  <text start="187.84" dur="7.229">the central bank loses all of its power</text>
  <text start="191.409" dur="4.83">to manipulate that market and of course</text>
  <text start="195.069" dur="4.681">the way they manipulate it is they just</text>
  <text start="196.239" dur="5.761">continually throw paper gold at the real</text>
  <text start="199.75" dur="4.08">physical gold market and they try to</text>
  <text start="202" dur="4.049">bring down the price and control at</text>
  <text start="203.83" dur="4.86">every single time same thing with the</text>
  <text start="206.049" dur="5.3">crypto currency market where you had</text>
  <text start="208.69" dur="5.46">mount GOx and those individuals that</text>
  <text start="211.349" dur="4.78">confiscated all those bitcoins they</text>
  <text start="214.15" dur="4.02">threw it onto the market I mean this was</text>
  <text start="216.129" dur="4.681">done on purpose it was all completely</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="5.37">set up to bring the Bitcoin market down</text>
  <text start="220.81" dur="5.85">and every time they sold all the Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="5.13">you saw a Bitcoin move down down down</text>
  <text start="226.66" dur="6">and this was all part of the plan to</text>
  <text start="228.67" dur="7.679">demonize cryptocurrency but one thing</text>
  <text start="232.66" dur="6.21">for sure is that trump has started the</text>
  <text start="236.349" dur="5.161">push of the plan to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="238.87" dur="5.67">central banking system and here are a</text>
  <text start="241.51" dur="5.67">couple reasons why we really don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="6.36">the Fed why the Fed should not even</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="5.91">exist and why it hurts the people of not</text>
  <text start="250.9" dur="6.329">just the United States but around the</text>
  <text start="253.09" dur="5.519">world now we like to think that we have</text>
  <text start="257.229" dur="4.651">a government of the people by the people</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="6.24">for the people but the truth is is that</text>
  <text start="261.88" dur="5.94">we have an unelected unaccountable group</text>
  <text start="264.849" dur="7.171">of central planners that have more power</text>
  <text start="267.82" dur="6.81">over our economy than anyone else in our</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="6.06">society does and this is not just the</text>
  <text start="274.63" dur="8.219">United States it&amp;#39;s also the ECB the IMF</text>
  <text start="278.08" dur="7.89">the biz and the rest they are unelected</text>
  <text start="282.849" dur="8.181">leaders who are controlling countries</text>
  <text start="285.97" dur="9.54">forcing them to write laws like</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="8.08">austerity and other type of laws forcing</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="5.7">the government to do what they want the</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="4.679">Federal Reserve is actually independent</text>
  <text start="301.21" dur="5.22">of the government in fact the Federal</text>
  <text start="303.789" dur="4.831">Reserve has argued vehemently in federal</text>
  <text start="306.43" dur="4.41">court that it is not an agency of the</text>
  <text start="308.62" dur="4.29">federal government and therefore it not</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="5.759">subject to the Freedom of Information</text>
  <text start="312.91" dur="6.15">Act the Federal Reserve openly admits</text>
  <text start="316.599" dur="4.671">that 12 Regional Federal Reserve banks</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="4.64">are organized much like private</text>
  <text start="321.27" dur="4.2">raishin x&amp;#39; the regional Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="323.7" dur="5.25">Bank&amp;#39;s issue shares of stock to the</text>
  <text start="325.47" dur="5.46">member banks that own them 100% of the</text>
  <text start="328.95" dur="4.41">shareholders of the Federal Reserve they</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="6.18">are private banks the US government owns</text>
  <text start="333.36" dur="5.82">zero shares the Federal Reserve is not</text>
  <text start="337.11" dur="3.96">an agency of the federal government but</text>
  <text start="339.18" dur="4.59">has been given power to regulate our</text>
  <text start="341.07" dur="5.39">banks and financial institutions this</text>
  <text start="343.77" dur="5.13">should not be happening according to</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="5.56">article 1 section 8 of the US</text>
  <text start="348.9" dur="4.74">Constitution the US Congress is the one</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="4.47">that is supposed to have the authority</text>
  <text start="353.64" dur="6.12">to coin money regulate the value thereof</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="5.37">of foreign coin and fix the standard of</text>
  <text start="359.76" dur="5.73">weights and measures so why is the</text>
  <text start="361.86" dur="6.48">Federal Reserve doing it if you look at</text>
  <text start="365.49" dur="5.58">the US dollar it actually says Federal</text>
  <text start="368.34" dur="5.13">Reserve Note at the top and the</text>
  <text start="371.07" dur="6.42">financial word a note is an instrument</text>

  <text start="377.49" dur="5.99">executive order 1 1 1 1 0 which</text>
  <text start="381.87" dur="4.59">authorized the US Treasury to issue</text>
  <text start="383.48" dur="4.9">United States notes which were created</text>
  <text start="386.46" dur="3.96">by the US government directly and not by</text>
  <text start="388.38" dur="4.92">the Federal Reserve he was assassinated</text>
  <text start="390.42" dur="4.68">shortly after the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="3.33">determines what levels some of the most</text>
  <text start="395.1" dur="4.67">important interest rates in our systems</text>
  <text start="396.63" dur="5.88">are going to be set at in a free market</text>
  <text start="399.77" dur="5.8">the free market would determine those</text>
  <text start="402.51" dur="4.89">interest rates not a central bank of</text>
  <text start="405.57" dur="5.43">course they&amp;#39;re determining it because</text>
  <text start="407.4" dur="5.52">they are pushing their own agenda the</text>
  <text start="411" dur="4.65">greatest period of economic growth in US</text>
  <text start="412.92" dur="6.03">history was when there was no central</text>
  <text start="415.65" dur="6.42">bank the Federal Reserve was designed to</text>
  <text start="418.95" dur="5.52">be a perpetual debt machine the bankers</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="4.65">that designed it intended to trap the US</text>
  <text start="424.47" dur="4.2">government in a perpetual debt spiral</text>
  <text start="426.72" dur="4.47">from which it could never possibly</text>
  <text start="428.67" dur="4.77">escape since the Federal Reserve was</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="4.62">established 100 years ago the u.s.</text>
  <text start="433.44" dur="6.93">national debt has gotten more than 5</text>
  <text start="435.81" dur="6.9">thousand times larger a permanent</text>
  <text start="440.37" dur="5.34">federal income tax was established the</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="5.1">exact same year that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="445.71" dur="4.83">was created this was not a coincidence</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="3.9">in order to pay for all of the</text>
  <text start="450.54" dur="4.09">government debt that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="451.71" dur="5.71">would create a federal income tax</text>
  <text start="454.63" dur="5.61">was necessary the whole idea was to</text>
  <text start="457.42" dur="4.35">transfer wealth from our pockets to the</text>
  <text start="460.24" dur="4.41">federal government and from the federal</text>
  <text start="461.77" dur="6.45">government to the bankers the period</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="5.88">prior to 1913 when there was no income</text>
  <text start="468.22" dur="6.48">tax was the greatest period of economic</text>
  <text start="470.53" dur="5.85">growth in US history for the time the</text>
  <text start="474.7" dur="5.61">Federal Reserve was created until now</text>
  <text start="476.38" dur="6.15">the US dollar has lost 98% of its value</text>
  <text start="480.31" dur="5.31">from the time that President Nixon took</text>
  <text start="482.53" dur="3.51">off took us off the gold standard until</text>
  <text start="485.62" dur="3.65">now</text>
  <text start="486.04" dur="7.14">the US dollar has lost 83% of its value</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="6.04">during the 100 years before the Federal</text>
  <text start="493.18" dur="3.96">Reserve was created the US economy</text>
  <text start="495.31" dur="3.84">really had any problems with inflation</text>
  <text start="497.14" dur="4.44">but since the Federal Reserve was</text>
  <text start="499.15" dur="4.32">established the US economy has</text>
  <text start="501.58" dur="4.89">experienced constant and never-ending</text>
  <text start="503.47" dur="5.64">inflation in the century before the</text>
  <text start="506.47" dur="5.58">reciprocal Reserve was created the</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="5.309">average annual rate of inflation was</text>
  <text start="512.05" dur="4.41">about 1/2 a percent in the centuries</text>
  <text start="514.419" dur="4.761">since the Federal Reserve was created</text>
  <text start="516.46" dur="6.9">the average annual rate of inflation was</text>

  <text start="525.22" dur="5.97">of wealth through hidden tax of</text>
  <text start="527.98" dur="6.45">inflation since the Federal Reserve was</text>
  <text start="531.19" dur="8.58">created there&amp;#39;s been 18 distinct</text>

  <text start="547.93" dur="5.67">2001 2008 and the one that is</text>
  <text start="551.14" dur="4.17">approaching according to an official</text>
  <text start="553.6" dur="3.93">government report the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="555.31" dur="4.74">made sixteen point one trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="557.53" dur="5.07">in secret loans to the big banks during</text>
  <text start="560.05" dur="4.68">the last financial crisis many people</text>
  <text start="562.6" dur="3.81">say this is a lot more this is why we</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="4.08">need to audit the Fed we need to</text>
  <text start="566.41" dur="3.99">understand what they&amp;#39;re doing but of</text>
  <text start="568.81" dur="4.71">course they don&amp;#39;t want anyone to audit</text>
  <text start="570.4" dur="4.92">them because it&amp;#39;s a secret because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.52" dur="4.14">a private corporation and the people</text>
  <text start="575.32" dur="5.31">don&amp;#39;t have the right to know well then</text>
  <text start="577.66" dur="6">this should not be part of the American</text>
  <text start="580.63" dur="5.19">system we don&amp;#39;t need it then most</text>
  <text start="583.66" dur="3.99">Americans have absolutely no idea where</text>
  <text start="585.82" dur="2.49">money comes from and the truth is is</text>
  <text start="587.65" dur="2.49">that the federal is</text>
  <text start="588.31" dur="4.23">serve it just creates it out of thin air</text>
  <text start="590.14" dur="3.63">this is how it&amp;#39;s done when the US</text>
  <text start="592.54" dur="2.88">government decides that it wants to</text>
  <text start="593.77" dur="4.35">spend another billion or trillion</text>
  <text start="595.42" dur="6.06">dollars that it doesn&amp;#39;t have it does not</text>
  <text start="598.12" dur="5.94">print up a billion dollars it creates</text>
  <text start="601.48" dur="5.07">and prints up US Treasury bonds and</text>
  <text start="604.06" dur="4.56">makes them and and takes them over to</text>
  <text start="606.55" dur="5.25">the Federal Reserve the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="608.62" dur="5.4">creates a billion dollars or trillion or</text>
  <text start="611.8" dur="5.97">whatever it is out of thin air and says</text>
  <text start="614.02" dur="4.65">okay here&amp;#39;s our currency that we just</text>
  <text start="617.77" dur="5.19">create out of thin air</text>
  <text start="618.67" dur="6.75">give me the Treasury bonds that&amp;#39;s it so</text>
  <text start="622.96" dur="6.06">why do we need the Fed to do this if we</text>
  <text start="625.42" dur="6.27">can create and print Treasury bonds even</text>
  <text start="629.02" dur="4.2">if we do it electronically why do we</text>
  <text start="631.69" dur="3.72">need the Federal Reserve to do that</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="4.14">it makes no sense I mean the US</text>
  <text start="635.41" dur="4.11">government it could actually create</text>
  <text start="637.36" dur="3.81">money spend it directly into the economy</text>
  <text start="639.52" dur="6.78">without the Federal Reserve being</text>
  <text start="641.17" dur="7.35">involved at all but if that happened we</text>
  <text start="646.3" dur="4.11">wouldn&amp;#39;t be 21 trillion dollars in debt</text>
  <text start="648.52" dur="5.55">and that wouldn&amp;#39;t serve the interest of</text>
  <text start="650.41" dur="5.34">the bankers at all now Congress they</text>
  <text start="654.07" dur="5.79">have the power to shut down the Federal</text>
  <text start="655.75" dur="7.25">Reserve at any time they can just do it</text>
  <text start="659.86" dur="6.86">but right now most of our politicians</text>
  <text start="663" dur="6.16">fully endorse the current system they</text>
  <text start="666.72" dur="4.68">become very very wealthy off of this</text>
  <text start="669.16" dur="5.64">system why would they want it to go away</text>
  <text start="671.4" dur="6.76">so nothing is going to happen until we</text>
  <text start="674.8" dur="6.6">clean house until we get rid of all</text>
  <text start="678.16" dur="5.4">these individuals that understand that</text>
  <text start="681.4" dur="5.7">the deep state the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="683.56" dur="6.57">all one in the same and we need these</text>
  <text start="687.1" dur="6.48">individuals to see what the problem is</text>
  <text start="690.13" dur="5.76">and to get these people in line to show</text>
  <text start="693.58" dur="3.6">them and to say you know something we</text>
  <text start="695.89" dur="3.84">really don&amp;#39;t need the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="697.18" dur="5.61">this is why Rand Paul Ron Paul have been</text>
  <text start="699.73" dur="6.53">pushing the audit the Fed bill for a</text>
  <text start="702.79" dur="7.169">very long time Trump is out there now</text>
  <text start="706.26" dur="5.5">contradicting the Fed basically what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="709.959" dur="4.561">happening is they&amp;#39;re pushing the plan</text>
  <text start="711.76" dur="4.77">forward this is all part of the same</text>
  <text start="714.52" dur="3.36">plan getting with it a deep state</text>

  <text start="717.88" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s all tied into the same thing</text>
  <text start="720.13" dur="3.39">everyone thinks it&amp;#39;s separate it really</text>
  <text start="722.08" dur="4.29">is in how do you think the deep state</text>
  <text start="723.52" dur="5.48">was able to fund all their operations</text>
  <text start="726.37" dur="5.54">think about it if we were on a system</text>
  <text start="729" dur="5.56">that was backed by gold and we only</text>
  <text start="731.91" dur="6.03">created the currency for the amount of</text>
  <text start="734.56" dur="8.36">gold that we had can the government</text>
  <text start="737.94" dur="8.28">borrow additional funds no yes</text>

  <text start="750.76" dur="7.23">know create funding through maybe drug</text>
  <text start="755.05" dur="5.79">deals and things like that but that</text>
  <text start="757.99" dur="4.49">wouldn&amp;#39;t be enough compared to what they</text>
  <text start="760.84" dur="5.36">get from the central bank this is</text>
  <text start="762.48" dur="7.36">trillions of dollars that are completely</text>
  <text start="766.2" dur="7.99">missing that are funneled into certain</text>
  <text start="769.84" dur="6.66">programs and if you get rid of the</text>
  <text start="774.19" dur="3.78">source just like they got rid of the</text>
  <text start="776.5" dur="3.99">source of the Islamic state funding</text>
  <text start="777.97" dur="4.71">which was the oil convoy they completely</text>

  <text start="782.68" dur="5.7">the central bank the deep state then</text>
  <text start="784.96" dur="7.02">implodes on itself it&amp;#39;s all connected</text>
  <text start="788.38" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s all one in the same and it gets</text>
  <text start="791.98" dur="2.96">worse and worse as time goes on I mean</text>
  <text start="793.99" dur="5.21">think about it</text>
  <text start="794.94" dur="8.2">leading up to the 60s and the 70s when</text>
  <text start="799.2" dur="6.64">Kennedy was trying to create currency</text>
  <text start="803.14" dur="4.38">outside of the Federal Reserve the</text>
  <text start="805.84" dur="4.17">central bank&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t like that the</text>
  <text start="807.52" dur="5.4">deep state they don&amp;#39;t like that this is</text>
  <text start="810.01" dur="6.81">not something they wanted and think</text>
  <text start="812.92" dur="6.03">about it they waited from 1913 to 1971</text>
  <text start="816.82" dur="3.3">to come off the gold standard yes they</text>
  <text start="818.95" dur="3.87">were doing other things getting</text>
  <text start="820.12" dur="4.95">everything prepared for what they wanted</text>
  <text start="822.82" dur="4.38">but you have to remember they are very</text>
  <text start="825.07" dur="5.21">patient and we&amp;#39;ve we went through</text>
  <text start="827.2" dur="6.6">different stages we had a World War 2</text>
  <text start="830.28" dur="6.22">where all the gold was sent to the US</text>
  <text start="833.8" dur="6.69">and the Federal Reserve was in control</text>
  <text start="836.5" dur="6.3">of this gold gee it seems like this was</text>
  <text start="840.49" dur="3.87">their plan in the first place and then</text>
  <text start="842.8" dur="4.89">of course what he do you take the hard</text>
  <text start="844.36" dur="4.86">assets and you create currency which is</text>
  <text start="847.69" dur="4.77">absolutely worthless because it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="849.22" dur="5.61">paper or electronic blips and this is</text>
  <text start="852.46" dur="3.21">what the central bankers do they take</text>
  <text start="854.83" dur="4.53">their</text>
  <text start="855.67" dur="6.72">phony paper money and they put countries</text>
  <text start="859.36" dur="5.34">into debt and they buy up their assets</text>
  <text start="862.39" dur="3.57">through their other shell corporations</text>
  <text start="864.7" dur="4.74">there are other investment funds and</text>
  <text start="865.96" dur="6.63">things like that we&amp;#39;re in this gigantic</text>
  <text start="869.44" dur="7.26">scam and they&amp;#39;re scamming the entire</text>
  <text start="872.59" dur="7.08">world and it&amp;#39;s time to end all this and</text>
