  <text start="162.59" dur="4.679">any way you want the bottom line is when</text>
  <text start="165.29" dur="3.509">you really look at what&amp;#39;s going on you</text>
  <text start="167.269" dur="4.321">can see what&amp;#39;s really happening I mean</text>
  <text start="168.799" dur="5.91">let&amp;#39;s look out in the UK right now the</text>
  <text start="171.59" dur="5.369">UK there&amp;#39;s a huge housing real estate</text>
  <text start="174.709" dur="4.59">downturn right now the same thing that</text>
  <text start="176.959" dur="4.351">we&amp;#39;re seeing in Australia in Canada the</text>
  <text start="179.299" dur="4.381">u.s. of course everyone&amp;#39;s making it seem</text>
  <text start="181.31" dur="3.87">like everything&amp;#39;s fantastic but when you</text>
  <text start="183.68" dur="2.34">look at this you can see that there were</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="3.57">major major</text>
  <text start="186.02" dur="5.46">problems now out in the UK we have this</text>
  <text start="188.75" dur="4.68">company called countrywide this is UK&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.48" dur="5.31">largest real estate service group with</text>
  <text start="193.43" dur="6.45">over 10,000 employees in 900 locations</text>
  <text start="196.79" dur="5.64">and they&amp;#39;re seeing their shares drop by</text>
  <text start="199.88" dur="5.64">like something like 60% what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="7.59">problem the problem is they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="205.52" dur="7.08">problems selling homes people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="210.02" dur="6.27">coming to purchase traffic is drawing up</text>
  <text start="212.6" dur="7.74">and it&amp;#39;s getting worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="7.77">and countrywide said it&amp;#39;s problem had</text>
  <text start="220.34" dur="5.97">been exacerbated by a flagging housing</text>
  <text start="224.06" dur="4.83">market particularly in London the prime</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="4.41">central London housing market continues</text>
  <text start="228.89" dur="4.44">to experience low levels of activity</text>
  <text start="230.72" dur="4.56">owing to political and economic</text>
  <text start="233.33" dur="4.44">uncertainty now of course they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="235.28" dur="5.16">the brexit to explain away what is</text>
  <text start="237.77" dur="5.07">happening here but we see this happening</text>
  <text start="240.44" dur="4.44">in Canada we see it happening in</text>
  <text start="242.84" dur="5.01">Australia we&amp;#39;re seeing it happen in the</text>
  <text start="244.88" dur="6.12">US this has nothing to do with brexit</text>
  <text start="247.85" dur="6.78">what is happening here is that people</text>
  <text start="251" dur="5.73">the everyday person who has a job cannot</text>
  <text start="254.63" dur="4.53">go out and afford anything anymore</text>
  <text start="256.73" dur="4.77">they can&amp;#39;t take on a new loan it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.16" dur="4.77">completely impossible and it is</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="4.08">spreading we&amp;#39;re seeing in Australia</text>
  <text start="263.93" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Canada we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="265.58" dur="5.25">it throughout Europe the UK the United</text>
  <text start="268.1" dur="5.04">States it&amp;#39;s all starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="270.83" dur="4.41">now here in the United States we had the</text>
  <text start="273.14" dur="4.41">GDP numbers come out and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="275.24" dur="6.66">reason why we&amp;#39;re seeing all this this is</text>
  <text start="277.55" dur="6.18">to control the narrative to control what</text>
  <text start="281.9" dur="4.26">is coming up and all this is being</text>
  <text start="283.73" dur="5.24">prepared for the economic transition</text>
  <text start="286.16" dur="5.58">remember who put this system into place</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="5.11">it was the central bank system who</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="5.34">started manipulating the data the deep</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="4.77">state the central bank this is just a</text>
  <text start="297.08" dur="5.73">continuation of what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="298.85" dur="6.09">why why all of a sudden have they taking</text>
  <text start="302.81" dur="5.58">this to the extreme do you really think</text>
  <text start="304.94" dur="8.04">GDP miraculously went up to 4% overnight</text>
  <text start="308.39" dur="8.339">no it&amp;#39;s impossible they they manipulate</text>
  <text start="312.98" dur="6.9">the data on purpose now they change the</text>
  <text start="316.729" dur="5.011">calculation of real GDP from using 2000</text>
  <text start="319.88" dur="4.26">nine dollars to twenty twelve dollars</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="4.71">which boosted growth strictly from a</text>
  <text start="324.14" dur="4.92">lower rate of inflation now remember the</text>
  <text start="326.45" dur="3.96">Fed is out there and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="329.06" dur="2.94">media is out there the corporate media</text>
  <text start="330.41" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="332" dur="3.81">inflation is like you know 1% one point</text>
  <text start="334.22" dur="3.51">two percent one point five percent we</text>
  <text start="335.81" dur="5.4">want to get it up to two percent but if</text>
  <text start="337.73" dur="7.2">you go out and you ask the average</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="6.32">household about real inflation and you</text>
  <text start="344.93" dur="6.24">talk about health care costs insurance</text>
  <text start="347.53" dur="5.83">food energy do you really think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="351.17" dur="5.31">gonna say yeah it&amp;#39;s about one percent no</text>
  <text start="353.36" dur="6.27">they are likely to give you an earful</text>
  <text start="356.48" dur="6.36">that the cost of living is substantially</text>
  <text start="359.63" dur="6.63">higher than one point two percent but if</text>
  <text start="362.84" dur="5.25">you look if you look at what the Fed has</text>
  <text start="366.26" dur="4.92">been doing they&amp;#39;ve been telling you that</text>
  <text start="368.09" dur="5.1">we don&amp;#39;t see inflation and we know that</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="6.69">this is completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="373.19" dur="6.36">now this revision which was almost</text>
  <text start="377.87" dur="5.01">entirely due to the change in the</text>
  <text start="379.55" dur="5.46">inflation rate on a nominal basis there</text>
  <text start="382.88" dur="4.74">was virtually no real change at all in</text>
  <text start="385.01" dur="5.94">other words stronger economic growth</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="6.3">came from a mathematical adjustment</text>
  <text start="390.95" dur="6.3">rather than the increases in actual</text>
  <text start="393.92" dur="7.08">economic activity the change to a lower</text>
  <text start="397.25" dur="5.46">inflation rate also boosted disposable</text>
  <text start="401" dur="4.23">incomes and personal consumption</text>
  <text start="402.71" dur="8.51">expenditures which also boosted the</text>
  <text start="405.23" dur="9.15">savings rate but that changed that</text>
  <text start="411.22" dur="7.87">calculation that they changed it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="414.38" dur="7.56">change an economic reality yes on paper</text>
  <text start="419.09" dur="4.58">it looks great but in reality that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.94" dur="4.13">something completely different</text>
  <text start="423.67" dur="4.72">despite the adjusted bump in savings</text>
  <text start="426.07" dur="5.38">consumer activity continues to remain</text>
  <text start="428.39" dur="5.88">weak given that roughly seventy percent</text>
  <text start="431.45" dur="6.3">of the economic calculation comes from</text>
  <text start="434.27" dur="5.97">personal consumption so if we watch</text>
  <text start="437.75" dur="4.05">consumer activity which is a good</text>
  <text start="440.24" dur="4.74">leading indicator of where the economy</text>
  <text start="441.8" dur="6">is headed next we can see that consumers</text>
  <text start="444.98" dur="5.61">are not very active why do you think</text>
  <text start="447.8" dur="4.94">retail is plummeting why do you think</text>
  <text start="450.59" dur="4.31">people are not purchasing homes</text>
  <text start="452.74" dur="5.34">why do you think automobile sales are</text>
  <text start="454.9" dur="7.11">dropping because the plan was to get</text>
  <text start="458.08" dur="5.97">everyone in subprime sub subprime anyone</text>
  <text start="462.01" dur="3.87">that has a heartbeat they&amp;#39;re running out</text>
  <text start="464.05" dur="4.83">people that&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="465.88" dur="5.49">so changing the math doesn&amp;#39;t change</text>
  <text start="468.88" dur="5.07">reality and if you look on the street</text>
  <text start="471.37" dur="6.68">and you talk to the everyday person you</text>
  <text start="473.95" dur="6.15">can see that reality does not match the</text>
  <text start="478.05" dur="5.47">statistical information that they</text>
  <text start="480.1" dur="4.34">changed but this is all being done on</text>
  <text start="483.52" dur="2.82">purpose</text>
  <text start="484.44" dur="3.97">because what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.34" dur="3.84">pushing the economy to the edge to</text>
  <text start="488.41" dur="3.39">control the narrative because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="490.18" dur="4.23">gonna go back and say hey wait a minute</text>
  <text start="491.8" dur="4.35">who&amp;#39;s been doing this who&amp;#39;s in charge of</text>
  <text start="494.41" dur="2.82">this we&amp;#39;re we getting these numbers</text>
  <text start="496.15" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;ve been telling me all along</text>
  <text start="497.23" dur="4.47">that the economy&amp;#39;s doing fantastically</text>
  <text start="499.57" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re these the same calculations that</text>
  <text start="501.7" dur="4.92">Obama was using I mean the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="504.67" dur="4.98">know that these are fake numbers what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.62" dur="7.35">going on here that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="509.65" dur="6.27">happen now remember under Obama and many</text>
  <text start="513.97" dur="4.41">other presidents they were putting a lot</text>
  <text start="515.92" dur="4.68">of people on food stamps getting a lot</text>
  <text start="518.38" dur="4.95">of people on to entitlement programs and</text>
  <text start="520.6" dur="4.71">they were making everyone dependent on</text>
  <text start="523.33" dur="3.33">the government and once you have</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="4.41">everyone dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="526.66" dur="6.11">you can control people now remember what</text>
  <text start="529.72" dur="7.29">they wanted to do is they wanted to</text>
  <text start="532.77" dur="7.54">place everyone on the government</text>
  <text start="537.01" dur="5.97">entitlement programs also give them</text>
  <text start="540.31" dur="5.07">universal basic income just continually</text>
  <text start="542.98" dur="4.92">create currency create currency even if</text>
  <text start="545.38" dur="4.83">the economy collapses they would put the</text>
  <text start="547.9" dur="5.16">printing presses into double overdrive</text>
  <text start="550.21" dur="6">and people still get their entitlements</text>
  <text start="553.06" dur="6.57">now when the economy collapses we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="556.21" dur="4.77">doing that and if you had people on all</text>
  <text start="559.63" dur="3.03">these entitlement programs like food</text>
  <text start="560.98" dur="3.39">stamps and things like that and people</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="3.93">weren&amp;#39;t receiving it you might have</text>
  <text start="564.37" dur="5.88">riots you might have people very upset</text>
  <text start="566.59" dur="6.48">so before the transition occurs you need</text>
  <text start="570.25" dur="6.39">to get everyone off of the government</text>
  <text start="573.07" dur="5.34">assistant programs yes there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="576.64" dur="4.38">going to be people on there but you</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t want to have the majority of the</text>
  <text start="581.02" dur="5.46">American people on it because they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="583.39" dur="7.4">rise up and they&amp;#39;ll be very pissed</text>
  <text start="586.48" dur="6.69">when their payments stopped so right now</text>
  <text start="590.79" dur="5.89">the Trump administration the Patriots</text>
  <text start="593.17" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re removing people from the food</text>
  <text start="596.68" dur="5.19">stamps about 3.5 million people have</text>
  <text start="599.08" dur="5.49">been lifted off food stamps right now so</text>
  <text start="601.87" dur="3.81">when the system falls apart they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="604.57" dur="3.03">have to look at the government and say</text>
  <text start="605.68" dur="3.27">hey how come we&amp;#39;re not getting our money</text>
  <text start="607.6" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;re getting very angry I can&amp;#39;t eat</text>
  <text start="608.95" dur="4.8">right now people are going to figure out</text>
  <text start="610.84" dur="5.04">a way to get their food maybe get a</text>
  <text start="613.75" dur="4.22">part-time job or at some other way and</text>
  <text start="615.88" dur="5.1">many people they were receiving this</text>
  <text start="617.97" dur="6.46">money where they really didn&amp;#39;t need it</text>
  <text start="620.98" dur="5.58">and they were just on it and all of this</text>
  <text start="624.43" dur="4.38">is being done for a particular reason</text>
  <text start="626.56" dur="3.66">now again I&amp;#39;m not saying that everyone</text>
  <text start="628.81" dur="3.5">was on there that didn&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="630.22" dur="4.74">be certain people that really do need it</text>
  <text start="632.31" dur="5.62">but to have three and a half million</text>
  <text start="634.96" dur="4.32">people on there it wasn&amp;#39;t going to work</text>
  <text start="637.93" dur="3.96">as we go through this transition because</text>
  <text start="639.28" dur="4.29">guess what the government cannot pay for</text>
  <text start="641.89" dur="3.81">all this this is not what the Founding</text>
  <text start="643.57" dur="3.63">Fathers really wanted and the only way</text>
  <text start="645.7" dur="3.84">to get off of this and I know it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="647.2" dur="3.69">be difficult for many people and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="649.54" dur="2.73">going to be difficult as we go through</text>
  <text start="650.89" dur="3.45">this transition nobody said this was</text>
  <text start="652.27" dur="3.78">going to be easy nobody said there was</text>
  <text start="654.34" dur="3.24">going to be a light switch what you just</text>
