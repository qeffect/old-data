  <text start="164.09" dur="8.58">everything happen in real time and the</text>
  <text start="168.5" dur="6.78">economy is part of the plan now what</text>
  <text start="172.67" dur="6.36">Trump and the Patriots have done they</text>
  <text start="175.28" dur="5.58">have made the economy look fantastic the</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="4.289">BLS was out there they released its</text>
  <text start="180.86" dur="4.65">latest jobs report and it was another</text>
  <text start="183.319" dur="6.931">record month for the Trump economy a</text>

  <text start="199.04" dur="7.44">level in July of nineteen million 481</text>
  <text start="203.38" dur="8.26">when you start looking at all of this</text>
  <text start="206.48" dur="8.52">you can see they are building the</text>
  <text start="211.64" dur="5.819">people&amp;#39;s economy this is not the central</text>
  <text start="215" dur="5.459">bank economy people are getting confused</text>
  <text start="217.459" dur="5.821">with this just because you see things</text>
  <text start="220.459" dur="5.25">happening like the mainstream media out</text>
  <text start="223.28" dur="4.319">there saying the stock market is falling</text>
  <text start="225.709" dur="4.411">him this is what we expected it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="227.599" dur="4.831">to get a lot worse the economy is going</text>
  <text start="230.12" dur="5.7">to crash everything&amp;#39;s going to fall</text>
  <text start="232.43" dur="6.33">apart what they&amp;#39;re talking about is the</text>
  <text start="235.82" dur="7.08">central bank system this is the central</text>
  <text start="238.76" dur="7.59">bank economy Trump the Patriots they are</text>
  <text start="242.9" dur="5.25">building the people&amp;#39;s economy now Trump</text>
  <text start="246.35" dur="5.07">needs to keep the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="248.15" dur="4.709">alive long enough to transition us but</text>
  <text start="251.42" dur="4.02">when you hear the mainstream media out</text>
  <text start="252.859" dur="4.651">there talking about the economy that</text>
  <text start="255.44" dur="4.289">were in today they&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="257.51" dur="6.06">central bank economy just like when we</text>
  <text start="259.729" dur="7.231">go back to 1971 and we heard about gold</text>
  <text start="263.57" dur="6.03">speculation and how we&amp;#39;re gonna take the</text>
  <text start="266.96" dur="4.74">United States off the gold standard and</text>
  <text start="269.6" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;re moving on to a petro dollar system</text>
  <text start="271.7" dur="4.29">of course that he mentioned the petro</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="4.77">dollar system this was the deep state</text>
  <text start="275.99" dur="4.02">transfer and the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.58" dur="4.83">transferring us to a system that they</text>
  <text start="280.01" dur="5.25">were developing all throughout the 60s</text>
  <text start="282.41" dur="5.3">no one knew about it the same thing is</text>
  <text start="285.26" dur="6.42">happening right now but in Reverse and</text>
  <text start="287.71" dur="5.35">right now Trump and the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="291.68" dur="5.1">have total control construction</text>
  <text start="293.06" dur="4.71">manufacturing it is all coming back to</text>
  <text start="296.78" dur="2.639">the United States</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="4.019">and Trump needs to do this in a very</text>
  <text start="299.419" dur="5.28">short period of time now Trump is still</text>
  <text start="301.789" dur="6.211">working on the trade deals with China</text>
  <text start="304.699" dur="5.97">and yes he&amp;#39;s implemented new or is going</text>
  <text start="308" dur="6.569">to implement new tariffs this is all</text>
  <text start="310.669" dur="5.97">being done on purpose why because Trump</text>
  <text start="314.569" dur="5.611">has been briefed that the Chinese</text>
  <text start="316.639" dur="6.75">economy is significantly weaker than</text>
  <text start="320.18" dur="6.359">anyone is emitting openly these new</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="6.241">tariffs will thus impose a punitive cost</text>
  <text start="326.539" dur="5.28">on G&amp;#39;s economy with the secondary</text>
  <text start="329.63" dur="5.069">benefit of encouraging further foreign</text>
  <text start="331.819" dur="5.521">capital evacuation from China companies</text>
  <text start="334.699" dur="4.861">leaving China companies coming back to</text>
  <text start="337.34" dur="4.979">the United States it is worth noting</text>
  <text start="339.56" dur="5.759">here that the ongoing protests in Hong</text>
  <text start="342.319" dur="5.581">Kong also trapped Beijing between its</text>
  <text start="345.319" dur="6.6">impulse to dominate and its desire to</text>
  <text start="347.9" dur="6.81">placate global investors by escalating</text>
  <text start="351.919" dur="5.28">the trade fight Trump is showing Beijing</text>
  <text start="354.71" dur="6.09">that he will risk his own electoral</text>
  <text start="357.199" dur="7.891">position in order to win Trump is using</text>
  <text start="360.8" dur="8.69">leverage Trump is putting the screws to</text>
  <text start="365.09" dur="7.169">China remember he&amp;#39;s dealing and</text>
  <text start="369.49" dur="3.79">negotiating with China to benefit the</text>
  <text start="372.259" dur="4.321">American people</text>
  <text start="373.28" dur="5.04">China is looking at what is going on</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="6.63">with our electoral process and they</text>
  <text start="378.32" dur="8.099">realize Trump is going to win China has</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="5.19">big problems Trump knows this this is</text>
  <text start="386.419" dur="5.071">why he placed additional tariffs to show</text>
  <text start="388.4" dur="4.59">that he means business and this is all</text>
  <text start="391.49" dur="5.669">being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="392.99" dur="7.799">now since the Fed came out and they</text>
  <text start="397.159" dur="6.781">lowered the rates everyone is out there</text>
  <text start="400.789" dur="5.88">saying look see we knew it once the</text>
  <text start="403.94" dur="4.71">rates came down the trade wars are on</text>
  <text start="406.669" dur="3.3">the stock market&amp;#39;s falling remember the</text>
  <text start="408.65" dur="3.12">stock market&amp;#39;s really not the gauge of</text>
  <text start="409.969" dur="3.331">the economy this is what the mainstream</text>
  <text start="411.77" dur="3.72">media the central bank has brainwashed</text>
  <text start="413.3" dur="6.149">two people into thinking so Trump is</text>
  <text start="415.49" dur="5.669">still using these tools against them but</text>
  <text start="419.449" dur="4.821">you need to go back in time a little bit</text>
  <text start="421.159" dur="6.301">remember back in December of 2018</text>
  <text start="424.27" dur="4.57">when all of a sudden the market came</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="4.37">down</text>
  <text start="428.84" dur="6.45">and it looked like it was crashing and</text>
  <text start="431.83" dur="7.149">back then we had CNBC and many other</text>
  <text start="435.29" dur="6.689">mainstream media outlets out there</text>
  <text start="438.979" dur="5.19">saying that oh this is awful this is the</text>
  <text start="441.979" dur="4.321">beginning of the end and the article</text>
  <text start="444.169" dur="4.56">back then was three reasons why the</text>
  <text start="446.3" dur="3.869">stock market is plummeting and what you</text>
  <text start="448.729" dur="4.47">should do and one of them the reasons</text>
  <text start="450.169" dur="4.951">was the ongoing trade war now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.199" dur="5.341">very interesting back in December 2018</text>
  <text start="455.12" dur="7.859">yes the market did come down what</text>
  <text start="458.54" dur="8.51">happened after that the market made new</text>
  <text start="462.979" dur="6.451">highs it recovered any went even higher</text>
  <text start="467.05" dur="7.06">wait didn&amp;#39;t we still have the trade war</text>
  <text start="469.43" dur="8.4">going on yes we did here we are in 2019</text>
  <text start="474.11" dur="7.02">were the month of August and the</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="7.32">headline for CNBC is Dow drops a hundred</text>
  <text start="481.13" dur="7.47">points on trade war fears heads for</text>
  <text start="485.15" dur="6.21">second worst week of 2019 so let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="488.6" dur="6.8">about this for a sec did the trade wars</text>
  <text start="491.36" dur="6.119">end with China since December of 2018 no</text>
  <text start="495.4" dur="4.239">actually Trump was going to place</text>
  <text start="497.479" dur="5.851">tariffs on Mexico he&amp;#39;s looking to place</text>
  <text start="499.639" dur="8.611">tariffs on other countries what he added</text>
  <text start="503.33" dur="8.58">another 10% on China think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.25" dur="6.63">happening right now the market yes is</text>
  <text start="511.91" dur="7.35">going to dip the market is going to go</text>
  <text start="514.88" dur="7.02">up remember just because it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="519.26" dur="5.97">down doesn&amp;#39;t mean that everything is</text>
  <text start="521.9" dur="6.51">crashing Trump the Patriots they have</text>
  <text start="525.23" dur="6.66">the magic wand you&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="528.41" dur="5.61">market completely recover of course what</text>
  <text start="531.89" dur="4.35">Trump is saying right now is that the</text>
  <text start="534.02" dur="6.689">markets coming down it&amp;#39;s because the fed</text>
  <text start="536.24" dur="9.18">they didn&amp;#39;t cut the rates far enough we</text>
  <text start="540.709" dur="8.371">need to cut them even more what did he</text>
  <text start="545.42" dur="5.96">just do he set up the Fed and the Fed is</text>
  <text start="549.08" dur="5.22">going to cut the rates even further and</text>
  <text start="551.38" dur="6.619">what&amp;#39;s going to happen to the market the</text>
  <text start="554.3" dur="8.139">market is going to go up</text>
  <text start="557.999" dur="8.43">why did he do it this way this is all</text>
  <text start="562.439" dur="7.71">part of the plan it allows him to blame</text>
  <text start="566.429" dur="6.24">what is happening on the Fed it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="570.149" dur="5.88">simple and then the market starts to</text>
  <text start="572.669" dur="6.09">move up because Trump will get what he</text>
  <text start="576.029" dur="5.1">wants he&amp;#39;s also going to do the same</text>
  <text start="578.759" dur="4.25">thing when he needs stimulus which is</text>
  <text start="581.129" dur="6.18">coming very very soon</text>
  <text start="583.009" dur="7.961">remember Trump has the magic wand the</text>
  <text start="587.309" dur="6.96">Patriots are in total control and the</text>
  <text start="590.97" dur="6.439">market is going to make new highs now</text>
  <text start="594.269" dur="7.5">once again the market is not the economy</text>
  <text start="597.409" dur="6.97">he&amp;#39;s just using the tools against the</text>
  <text start="601.769" dur="5.25">mainstream media the central bank and</text>
  <text start="604.379" dur="5.43">all the economists out there remember</text>
  <text start="607.019" dur="6.12">this system that were in nothing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="609.809" dur="5.88">changed is an illusion the central bank</text>
  <text start="613.139" dur="5.43">economy is an illusion it&amp;#39;s not a free</text>
  <text start="615.689" dur="7.5">open market we&amp;#39;re not seeing free open</text>
  <text start="618.569" dur="7.1">trade it&amp;#39;s a controlled market down to</text>
  <text start="623.189" dur="5.82">the nth degree</text>
  <text start="625.669" dur="8.71">Trump the Patriots they&amp;#39;re keeping it</text>
  <text start="629.009" dur="7.91">alive long enough basically the economy</text>
  <text start="634.379" dur="6.24">right now is on life support</text>
  <text start="636.919" dur="6.67">just keeping it beating until it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="640.619" dur="5.46">longer needed and what they&amp;#39;re doing in</text>
  <text start="643.589" dur="5.79">the background is they&amp;#39;re setting up the</text>
  <text start="646.079" dur="6.21">new system that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s bringing back</text>
  <text start="649.379" dur="5.88">jobs manufacturers putting the screws to</text>
  <text start="652.289" dur="6.54">China creating new bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="655.259" dur="6.84">agreements changing regulations removing</text>
  <text start="658.829" dur="6.15">the globalist trade deals this is all</text>
  <text start="662.099" dur="6.9">being done on purpose calling out the</text>

  <text start="668.999" dur="6.57">part of the plan were headed into the</text>
  <text start="671.909" dur="7.41">next phase the next phase is going to be</text>
  <text start="675.569" dur="7.59">calls to audit or to nationalize the Fed</text>
  <text start="679.319" dur="6.151">and this is going to be coming very very</text>
  <text start="683.159" dur="3.691">soon now of course he&amp;#39;s not gonna come</text>
  <text start="685.47" dur="2.939">out and say hey you know what I was just</text>
  <text start="686.85" dur="3.929">thinking the other day we should just</text>

  <text start="700.089" dur="5.25">to play it up and it will take some time</text>
  <text start="701.92" dur="7.349">and most likely he will probably begin</text>
  <text start="705.339" dur="8.97">this in the year of 2020 and as we move</text>
  <text start="709.269" dur="8.85">forward he&amp;#39;ll increase his attacks on</text>
  <text start="714.309" dur="7.38">the Fed he&amp;#39;s building the narrative over</text>
