  <text start="145.42" dur="5.19">ridiculous they&amp;#39;re manipulated and</text>

  <text start="150.61" dur="4.32">still that everything is great now yes</text>
  <text start="153.489" dur="3.211">the unemployment numbers went up to four</text>

  <text start="156.7" dur="4.38">looking at it saying hey</text>
  <text start="158.05" dur="7.35">four-point-seven percent pretty darn</text>

  <text start="165.4" dur="8.369">are good and we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="170.319" dur="5.611">hard data it is coming in and guess what</text>
  <text start="173.769" dur="7.101">it&amp;#39;s not looking good whatsoever</text>
  <text start="175.93" dur="6.03">actually out in England we can see that</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="4.3">the</text>
  <text start="181.96" dur="7.14">month of December well it wasn&amp;#39;t too</text>
  <text start="185.17" dur="6.21">good for retail there and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.1" dur="5.07">seeing coming out of the video of the</text>
  <text start="191.38" dur="5.76">European Commission showed that retail</text>
  <text start="194.17" dur="5.46">sales slowed in December now correct me</text>
  <text start="197.14" dur="5.63">if I&amp;#39;m wrong but isn&amp;#39;t December like one</text>
  <text start="199.63" dur="6.32">of the biggest shopping holidays ever</text>
  <text start="202.77" dur="7.33">isn&amp;#39;t this where retail stores online</text>
  <text start="205.95" dur="6.97">businesses make all their money to carry</text>
  <text start="210.1" dur="5.55">them through the rest of the year but</text>
  <text start="212.92" dur="5.58">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this</text>
  <text start="215.65" dur="6.48">holiday season in December was worse</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="5.37">than last holiday season and retail</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="6.09">sales fell by point one percent</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="6.54">year-on-year now we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="228.22" dur="4.35">thing here in the United States very</text>
  <text start="230.41" dur="4.95">interesting because they&amp;#39;ve been telling</text>
  <text start="232.57" dur="5.88">us that everything&amp;#39;s fantastic retail is</text>
  <text start="235.36" dur="6.54">incredible we know stores are already</text>
  <text start="238.45" dur="6.45">closing and there&amp;#39;s a lot more that are</text>
  <text start="241.9" dur="5.39">going to close and restaurants guess</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="4.56">what traffic is driving drying up and</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="5.71">sales are declining look at Ruby</text>
  <text start="249.46" dur="7.35">Tuesday&amp;#39;s sales decline by four point</text>
  <text start="253" dur="7.11">one percent when we look at the gap</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="6.74">Banana Republic sales are down seven</text>
  <text start="260.11" dur="5.93">percent and five point three percent</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="9.18">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="266.04" dur="9.43">complete disaster stores online sales</text>
  <text start="272.73" dur="6.94">guess what they have gone nowhere</text>
  <text start="275.47" dur="5.7">actually they&amp;#39;re contracting and this is</text>
  <text start="279.67" dur="3.6">a race against time right now because</text>
  <text start="281.17" dur="4.62">the central banker is the elite they</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="4.71">know this the entire systems imploding</text>
  <text start="285.79" dur="4.61">on itself now of course the job numbers</text>
  <text start="287.98" dur="5.64">came out they only moved up about</text>
  <text start="290.4" dur="5.95">156,000 jobs where that&amp;#39;s how many new</text>
  <text start="293.62" dur="4.95">jobs they created but something very</text>
  <text start="296.35" dur="4.35">interesting here they revised a lot of</text>
  <text start="298.57" dur="6.81">the numbers they did a revision in</text>
  <text start="300.7" dur="7.59">October revision in November and what</text>
  <text start="305.38" dur="5.58">they really did was they drove the</text>
  <text start="308.29" dur="7.5">numbers up a little bit to show that</text>
  <text start="310.96" dur="7.26">look we actually hit 156,000 they were</text>
  <text start="315.79" dur="4.56">actually expecting 178,000 but they did</text>
  <text start="318.22" dur="4.77">whatever they possibly could to try to</text>
  <text start="320.35" dur="5.22">get the numbers higher now when we look</text>
  <text start="322.99" dur="7.62">at this we see the revision in November</text>
  <text start="325.57" dur="8.97">went from 178,000 to 204,000 October was</text>
  <text start="330.61" dur="5.85">revised down from 140 to 135 for a net</text>
  <text start="334.54" dur="6.33">revision of the past two months of</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="9.51">19,000 additional jobs which they added</text>
  <text start="340.87" dur="7.11">in to right now to show that hey we came</text>
  <text start="345.97" dur="4.08">pretty close and that&amp;#39;s why unemployment</text>
  <text start="347.98" dur="5.46">moved down to point four point seven</text>
  <text start="350.05" dur="7.62">because it wasn&amp;#39;t enough but still it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.44" dur="7.59">under five percent full employment the</text>
  <text start="357.67" dur="8.04">only problem is more people fell off of</text>
  <text start="361.03" dur="6.27">a labor force the BLS announced that the</text>
  <text start="365.71" dur="5.01">total number of people not in the labor</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="6.54">force group ones more rising by 18,000</text>
  <text start="370.72" dur="5.01">in December and a whopping eight hundred</text>
  <text start="373.84" dur="6.05">and forty-one thousand in the past three</text>
  <text start="375.73" dur="7.17">months this is an all-time new high of</text>
  <text start="379.89" dur="10.75">ninety-five point 102 million Americans</text>
  <text start="382.9" dur="10.37">no longer in the workforce so how are</text>
  <text start="390.64" dur="4.74">they telling us that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="393.27" dur="3.52">well of course they say well these</text>
  <text start="395.38" dur="6.39">people aren&amp;#39;t looking for jobs they</text>
  <text start="396.79" dur="8.46">don&amp;#39;t want jobs really 95 million or so</text>
  <text start="401.77" dur="5.49">people don&amp;#39;t want to work and remember</text>
  <text start="405.25" dur="3.54">how they come up with this number if you</text>
  <text start="407.26" dur="4.98">haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview in four</text>
  <text start="408.79" dur="6.24">weeks guess what you&amp;#39;re just not counted</text>
  <text start="412.24" dur="5.48">anymore you don&amp;#39;t want a job you can be</text>
  <text start="415.03" dur="5.01">sending out your resume but you decided</text>
  <text start="417.72" dur="4.69">since nobody&amp;#39;s calling you back for an</text>
  <text start="420.04" dur="4.71">interview that you don&amp;#39;t want a job well</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="3.99">actually it&amp;#39;s the opposite people who</text>
  <text start="424.75" dur="3.66">are sending out thousands and thousands</text>
  <text start="426.4" dur="4.77">of resumes who are not getting any</text>
  <text start="428.41" dur="6">answer back well they want the job</text>
  <text start="431.17" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s just none out there so where are</text>
  <text start="434.41" dur="5.13">all these jobs that they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="6.02">about how how great everything is well</text>
  <text start="439.54" dur="8.68">what are we saying well health care</text>
  <text start="442.11" dur="8.7">added jobs about 70,000 we see that</text>
  <text start="448.22" dur="6.04">employment in the food services and</text>
  <text start="450.81" dur="7.11">drinking places well they trend it up by</text>
  <text start="454.26" dur="6.18">30,000 even though we see traffic drying</text>
  <text start="457.92" dur="4.77">up in restaurants sales declining and</text>
  <text start="460.44" dur="6.03">restaurants well that&amp;#39;s a very strange</text>
  <text start="462.69" dur="7.85">number right off the bat we see that the</text>
  <text start="466.47" dur="6.87">government added around 12,000 jobs and</text>
  <text start="470.54" dur="7.02">construction jobs while they declined by</text>
  <text start="473.34" dur="7.89">3,000 and manufacturing jobs also</text>
  <text start="477.56" dur="6.01">declined by 40 or so thousand and what</text>
  <text start="481.23" dur="5.03">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the jobs</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="6.5">that are continually added their</text>
  <text start="486.26" dur="6.67">low-paying part-time jobs once again and</text>
  <text start="490.07" dur="5.98">every time a person gets a low-paying</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="7.26">part-time job they are considered full</text>
  <text start="496.05" dur="6.869">time when they lose that job depending</text>
  <text start="500.19" dur="4.68">on how many hours they work and what</text>
  <text start="502.919" dur="4.801">their dollar amount is and it varies</text>
  <text start="504.87" dur="6.78">from state to state when they get laid</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="6.6">off just like those people in macys the</text>
  <text start="511.65" dur="5.189">majority of them can&amp;#39;t apply for</text>
  <text start="514.32" dur="5.519">unemployment insurance because they</text>
  <text start="516.839" dur="5.13">didn&amp;#39;t work enough hours and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="519.839" dur="4.231">make enough money so they were counted</text>
  <text start="521.969" dur="3.331">as a full-time job they get laid off and</text>
  <text start="524.07" dur="5.91">they can&amp;#39;t apply for the unemployment</text>
  <text start="525.3" dur="9.3">insurance and they&amp;#39;re not counted as a</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="7.17">job that was lost because it was a</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="4.62">part-time job and you can see how this</text>
  <text start="537.15" dur="5.13">whole thing works the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="539.22" dur="5.54">completely manipulated and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="542.28" dur="7.55">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="544.76" dur="8.47">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been using since</text>
  <text start="549.83" dur="5.79">1994 they change the calculation they</text>
  <text start="553.23" dur="7.109">changed the way everything is done</text>
  <text start="555.62" dur="7.42">because they knew that this was going to</text>
  <text start="560.339" dur="5.851">happen and as we move forward throughout</text>
  <text start="563.04" dur="4.71">this period from 1994 and on they had to</text>
  <text start="566.19" dur="3.99">continually change the calculation and</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="5.22">how this was done the only reason you do</text>
  <text start="570.18" dur="6.06">this is because you know the numbers</text>
  <text start="572.97" dur="5.13">aren&amp;#39;t going to make sense if you keep</text>
  <text start="576.24" dur="4.86">the calculations the same because it</text>
  <text start="578.1" dur="5.13">would show that we&amp;#39;re in a bad recession</text>
  <text start="581.1" dur="4.08">right now and of course Obama doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="583.23" dur="5.82">want people to say that throughout his</text>
  <text start="585.18" dur="7.62">presidency everything was no good it was</text>
  <text start="589.05" dur="7.08">a recession that we never recovered but</text>
  <text start="592.8" dur="5.52">when everything is said and done and the</text>
  <text start="596.13" dur="5.43">truth comes out we&amp;#39;re going to find out</text>
  <text start="598.32" dur="5.72">that we have been in a recession we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="601.56" dur="5.34">heading towards a depression a collapse</text>
  <text start="604.04" dur="6.13">we see factory orders while they plunge</text>
  <text start="606.9" dur="5.79">the most since august of 2014 november</text>
  <text start="610.17" dur="6.06">so orders plunge by 2.4% month a month</text>
  <text start="612.69" dur="6.09">and the biggest drop since august this</text>
  <text start="616.23" dur="5.07">drop comes despite a hundred and three</text>
  <text start="618.78" dur="6.9">percent month-on-month rise in defense</text>
  <text start="621.3" dur="6.06">aircraft orders and non-defense aircraft</text>
  <text start="625.68" dur="3.9">order crashed by seventy three point</text>
  <text start="627.36" dur="5.07">eight percent I mean this is horrific</text>
  <text start="629.58" dur="9.12">here so the only thing that was keeping</text>
  <text start="632.43" dur="11.7">it up was the defense orders remove all</text>
  <text start="638.7" dur="6.81">of that this is worse than ever and when</text>
  <text start="644.13" dur="3.18">we look at this we can see factory</text>
  <text start="645.51" dur="5.61">orders decline for the twenty third</text>
  <text start="647.31" dur="6.9">month of the last 25 what does that tell</text>
  <text start="651.12" dur="7.14">you it tells you that things are a lot</text>
  <text start="654.21" dur="6.63">worse than what they&amp;#39;re telling us we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="658.26" dur="4.41">heading towards the end stage and</text>
  <text start="660.84" dur="5.49">something very interesting about fed</text>
  <text start="662.67" dur="6.3">Williams where he said listen everyone</text>
  <text start="666.33" dur="7.53">you might as well get used to sub two</text>
  <text start="668.97" dur="7.98">percent gdp or even lower meaning that</text>
  <text start="673.86" dur="5.94">the stimulus is not working all of this</text>
  <text start="676.95" dur="4.89">is not working at all and we should just</text>
  <text start="679.8" dur="4.89">get used to that the economy is never</text>
  <text start="681.84" dur="6.27">really going to cut recover fully I mean</text>
  <text start="684.69" dur="7.65">this is what they&amp;#39;re saying even at full</text>
  <text start="688.11" dur="7.02">employment now the wages aren&amp;#39;t where</text>
  <text start="692.34" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re supposed to be because people</text>
  <text start="695.13" dur="4.56">are working part-time a lot of people</text>
  <text start="696.75" dur="7.22">aren&amp;#39;t working at all manufacturing</text>
  <text start="699.69" dur="9">factory orders industrial production all</text>
  <text start="703.97" dur="7.12">dead in the water here retail store</text>
  <text start="708.69" dur="7.04">information the data is coming in and</text>
  <text start="711.09" dur="8.63">it&amp;#39;s horrific stores are already closing</text>
  <text start="715.73" dur="7.24">does this really sound like a recovery</text>
  <text start="719.72" dur="6.73">but don&amp;#39;t worry the dow is approaching</text>
  <text start="722.97" dur="6.21">20,000 points that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="726.45" dur="4.71">to get it to and they&amp;#39;re putting up this</text>
  <text start="729.18" dur="4.68">huge production making it look really</text>
  <text start="731.16" dur="6.57">great and everyone&amp;#39;s gonna go hara hara</text>
  <text start="733.86" dur="6.6">when it hits 20,000 points i think we</text>
  <text start="737.73" dur="5.85">saw this before i mentioned it before</text>
  <text start="740.46" dur="5.01">when the dow hit a thousand and guess</text>
  <text start="743.58" dur="4.02">what happened afterwards it came</text>
  <text start="745.47" dur="6.57">crashing down that&amp;#39;s going to be the</text>
  <text start="747.6" dur="6.36">signal when it hits 20,000 points let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="752.04" dur="4.2">see if they can do it I do believe they</text>
