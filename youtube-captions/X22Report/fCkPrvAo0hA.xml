  <text start="53.37" dur="4.98">hi and welcome you listening to the X</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="5.099">when we to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="58.35" dur="6.06">this is episode 1271 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="5.191">is May 4th 2017 and the plot of the</text>
  <text start="64.41" dur="5.19">episode is the economy is rolling over</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="5.34">which will result in a catastrophe let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="69.6" dur="5.73">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.27" dur="5.97">news now we&amp;#39;ve been following the</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="4.77">jobless claims for quite a while right</text>
  <text start="78.24" dur="4.02">now we know that these numbers are</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="4.56">completely manipulated we know how it</text>
  <text start="82.26" dur="4.32">works if you&amp;#39;re in retail and you lose</text>
  <text start="84.66" dur="4.739">your job and your part-time you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="4.55">really not counted as losing your job so</text>
  <text start="89.399" dur="5.121">you really don&amp;#39;t have the ability to</text>
  <text start="91.13" dur="6.46">make a claim and what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="94.52" dur="5.05">since Trump has become president and</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="4.01">even before he was president is that</text>
  <text start="99.57" dur="5.82">jobless claims they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="101.6" dur="5.86">heading downward now every so often we</text>
  <text start="105.39" dur="5.16">have a little spike up but then again it</text>
  <text start="107.46" dur="4.38">continues the path moving down but</text>
  <text start="110.55" dur="5.01">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="111.84" dur="6.15">this is that when we look at the past</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="6.259">and we look at the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="117.99" dur="8.01">claims going back in time if we look at</text>
  <text start="121.819" dur="7.961">2007 after 2006 going into 2008 we look</text>
  <text start="126" dur="8.58">at 1999 2000 2001 we go back all the way</text>
  <text start="129.78" dur="6.99">to 1990 to 1991 and we go further back</text>
  <text start="134.58" dur="5.16">we can see that there is a definite</text>
  <text start="136.77" dur="5.52">pattern and every time the initial</text>
  <text start="139.74" dur="6.84">jobless claims reach a certain level and</text>
  <text start="142.29" dur="7.95">they decline to a certain point all of a</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="6.39">sudden we end up in a recession or a</text>
  <text start="150.24" dur="5.999">great recession or a depression and</text>
  <text start="152.97" dur="5.73">we&amp;#39;ve seen this multiple times going</text>
  <text start="156.239" dur="7.411">back in history and we&amp;#39;ve seen this back</text>
  <text start="158.7" dur="9.33">in 2006-2007 we also saw it back in 2000</text>
  <text start="163.65" dur="8.339">2001 and we are now at the lowest point</text>
  <text start="168.03" dur="7.14">that we&amp;#39;ve ever been since 1973 which</text>
  <text start="171.989" dur="5.761">means the fall and I mean the fall of</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="5.97">the entire system is going to be that</text>
  <text start="177.75" dur="7.049">much greater and we can see that these</text>
  <text start="181.14" dur="5.88">patterns are continually showing us that</text>
  <text start="184.799" dur="4.681">things are getting worse</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="4.59">and worse now I know Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="189.48" dur="4.95">and he&amp;#39;s saying that you know more</text>
  <text start="191.61" dur="4.5">manufacturing jobs more manufacturers</text>
  <text start="194.43" dur="3.93">going to be building here in the United</text>
  <text start="196.11" dur="4.47">States and jobs and coming back to the</text>
  <text start="198.36" dur="4.92">United States even Apple is out there</text>
  <text start="200.58" dur="6.54">and they are promoting their advanced</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="5.01">manufacturing CEO Tim Cook and he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="207.12" dur="3.95">there saying that we&amp;#39;re going to invest</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="5.85">about a 1 billion dollars that would</text>
  <text start="211.07" dur="6.4">bring advanced manufacturing to the</text>
  <text start="214.14" dur="5.61">United States and he says that the 1</text>
  <text start="217.47" dur="4.89">billion would have to be our US money</text>
  <text start="219.75" dur="4.29">which we have to borrow to get and</text>
  <text start="222.36" dur="4.83">people say well don&amp;#39;t they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="5.79">cash doesn&amp;#39;t Apple have this money well</text>
  <text start="227.19" dur="5.13">most of Apple&amp;#39;s cash is registered</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="5.55">overseas the result of profits that have</text>
  <text start="232.32" dur="5.25">not been taxed in the US Apple&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.38" dur="4.8">overseas cash can be and is already</text>
  <text start="237.57" dur="4.95">invested in the u.s. such as Treasury</text>
  <text start="240.18" dur="4.98">securities but it cannot be used for</text>
  <text start="242.52" dur="4.44">capital expenditures or share buybacks</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="4.08">in the u.s. without being repatriated</text>
  <text start="246.96" dur="5.85">under the US tax code and thus</text>
  <text start="249.24" dur="5.88">triggering an income tax event so this</text>
  <text start="252.81" dur="5.7">is why they&amp;#39;re going to borrow very</text>
  <text start="255.12" dur="6.69">interesting now we need to understand</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="7.71">that 7 million manufacturing jobs were</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="6.9">lost here since 1979 and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="266.22" dur="4.53">coming back we can pretend that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="4.2">all going to come back lickety-split no</text>
  <text start="270.75" dur="6.45">problem but this has been going on since</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="7.8">1979 and here we are in 2017 and these</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="6.15">jobs that the Apple CEO is talking about</text>
  <text start="280.71" dur="6.45">well they&amp;#39;re not going to be jobs for</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="5.04">people these are going to be robots this</text>
  <text start="287.16" dur="5.04">is why he&amp;#39;s saying advanced</text>
  <text start="288.39" dur="6.42">manufacturing he&amp;#39;s saying that robots</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="4.77">are going to manufacture here in the</text>
  <text start="294.81" dur="5.04">United States and why do they want</text>
  <text start="296.97" dur="5.34">robots because robots no matter which</text>
  <text start="299.85" dur="4.62">country they&amp;#39;re in they don&amp;#39;t get paid</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="4.35">you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about a pension</text>
  <text start="304.47" dur="5.19">you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about salary</text>
  <text start="306.66" dur="5.58">increase robots cost the same in every</text>
  <text start="309.66" dur="5.55">single country so it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if</text>
  <text start="312.24" dur="4.62">the manufacturing is here or not here I</text>
  <text start="315.21" dur="4.34">mean yes there&amp;#39;s taxes and other things</text>
  <text start="316.86" dur="3.91">but if that is all stripped away</text>
  <text start="319.55" dur="3.95">manufacturing</text>
  <text start="320.77" dur="4.53">will be exactly the same and we can see</text>
  <text start="323.5" dur="4.5">this is where they are headed right now</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="6.119">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="328" dur="6.509">manufacturing most likely on a grand</text>
  <text start="331.419" dur="5.28">scale will never return here to the</text>
  <text start="334.509" dur="4.051">United States because we can see already</text>
  <text start="336.699" dur="5.581">overseas in China and other areas</text>
  <text start="338.56" dur="8.22">they&amp;#39;re already turning to automation to</text>
  <text start="342.28" dur="7.47">robots to create the products and this</text>
  <text start="346.78" dur="6.09">is going to be a huge problem and as we</text>
  <text start="349.75" dur="6.06">move forward these jobs most likely will</text>
  <text start="352.87" dur="4.979">not exist in the future now we can still</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="4.199">become a manufacturing powerhouse by</text>
  <text start="357.849" dur="3.121">having manufacturers come back to the</text>
  <text start="360.009" dur="3.84">United States and maybe there&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="360.97" dur="6.06">other jobs to maintain the robots but</text>
  <text start="363.849" dur="5.25">there won&amp;#39;t be as many jobs so we can</text>
  <text start="367.03" dur="4.68">see right now the promise of bringing</text>
  <text start="369.099" dur="5.88">back all these jobs it is just not going</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="5.519">to work after the crash bringing back</text>
  <text start="374.979" dur="4.891">the manufacturing companies and creating</text>
  <text start="377.229" dur="3.961">other high skill level jobs to maintain</text>
  <text start="379.87" dur="3.12">the robots and things like that</text>
  <text start="381.19" dur="4.68">yes that is a completely different story</text>
  <text start="382.99" dur="5.34">so we&amp;#39;re seeing that factory orders here</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="4.799">in the United States well they have</text>
  <text start="388.33" dur="5.49">completely disappointed factory orders</text>
  <text start="390.669" dur="5.97">rose just 0.2 percent they expected a</text>
  <text start="393.82" dur="6.36">point four percent game and it was the</text>
  <text start="396.639" dur="5.701">0.3% tumble in core orders and if we</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="3.93">exclude transportation that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="402.34" dur="4.71">talking about this is the biggest month</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="6.029">a month drop since February of 2016 we</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="5.82">also see US productivity it has dropped</text>
  <text start="410.139" dur="5.34">for four of the last six quarters</text>
  <text start="412.87" dur="5.34">plunging 0.6 percent in the first</text>
  <text start="415.479" dur="6">quarter dramatically worse than the</text>
  <text start="418.21" dur="5.67">point 1 percent decline expected now we</text>
  <text start="421.479" dur="5.43">can see that things are absolutely</text>
  <text start="423.88" dur="5.039">getting worse in the United States we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="426.909" dur="4.471">been following this we&amp;#39;ve been tracking</text>
  <text start="428.919" dur="5.791">it and we realize when we understand</text>
  <text start="431.38" dur="4.95">that each of the economic sectors that</text>
  <text start="434.71" dur="3.239">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at they have been</text>
  <text start="436.33" dur="2.94">contracting there has been no</text>
  <text start="437.949" dur="2.911">improvement whatsoever</text>
  <text start="439.27" dur="4.199">every time the corporate media talks</text>
  <text start="440.86" dur="5.309">about a surge you need to put it in into</text>
  <text start="443.469" dur="3.54">context because they say oh housing is</text>
  <text start="446.169" dur="3.18">surging</text>
  <text start="447.009" dur="4.41">but when housing is in the negative</text>
  <text start="449.349" dur="4.29">range and there&amp;#39;s negative sales or it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.419" dur="3.261">close to zero and they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.639" dur="3.771">surging by</text>
  <text start="454.68" dur="4.59">point eight-percent that&amp;#39;s not really a</text>
  <text start="457.41" dur="3.84">surd on the grand scale because if you</text>
  <text start="459.27" dur="4.56">step back and look at the graph you can</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="4.56">see that housing was at four five six</text>
  <text start="463.83" dur="3.959">percent at that point in time the same</text>
  <text start="465.81" dur="5.07">thing with manufacturing the same thing</text>
  <text start="467.789" dur="6.121">with pretty much everything but they use</text>
  <text start="470.88" dur="5.069">these type of words to convince you that</text>
  <text start="473.91" dur="2.94">things are a lot better than they really</text>
  <text start="475.949" dur="4.771">are because when you hear in the news</text>
  <text start="476.85" dur="6.72">well factory orders surged by 0.2</text>
  <text start="480.72" dur="4.89">percent it does sound good until you</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="6.93">step back and you look and you say okay</text>
  <text start="485.61" dur="7.65">the previous months well they were at 1%</text>
  <text start="490.5" dur="6.3">they were at 0.8%</text>
  <text start="493.26" dur="8.01">and now it&amp;#39;s at 0.2 percent that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="496.8" dur="6.69">really a surge that&amp;#39;s a decline and we</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="4.709">need to understand they use this to</text>
  <text start="503.49" dur="5.04">convince everyone that the economy is</text>
  <text start="505.979" dur="6.211">still doing well and we know that it is</text>
  <text start="508.53" dur="6.08">not now Kyle bass is out there and he is</text>
  <text start="512.19" dur="5.399">warning that China&amp;#39;s credit system</text>
  <text start="514.61" dur="5.5">expanded too recklessly and too quickly</text>
  <text start="517.589" dur="4.801">and it&amp;#39;s beginning to unravel now we</text>
  <text start="520.11" dur="4.59">looked at this before we know that the</text>
  <text start="522.39" dur="4.83">credit indicator showing us that things</text>
  <text start="524.7" dur="4.59">are rapidly falling apart and we know</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="4.98">from Bill halter that credit is</text>
  <text start="529.29" dur="4.56">eventually going to freeze up and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.2" dur="3.66">starting to get confirmation about all</text>
  <text start="533.85" dur="4.23">this because Kyle bass is saying that</text>
  <text start="535.86" dur="4.44">the ballooning assets and Chinese wealth</text>
  <text start="538.08" dur="6.84">management products are another sign of</text>
  <text start="540.3" dur="6.51">a looming credit crisis in the nation he</text>
  <text start="544.92" dur="3.63">says as soon as liabilities have</text>
  <text start="546.81" dur="4.08">problems meaning the depositors decide</text>
  <text start="548.55" dur="5.4">not to roll their holdings all hell</text>
  <text start="550.89" dur="6.18">breaks loose think about this in the</text>
  <text start="553.95" dur="4.98">u.s. our asset liability mismatch at the</text>
  <text start="557.07" dur="6.33">peak of our subprime greatness was</text>
  <text start="558.93" dur="8.55">around 2% China&amp;#39;s mismatch is around 10%</text>
  <text start="563.4" dur="7.14">of the system he said in the US the</text>
  <text start="567.48" dur="5.85">first bumps in the road that hit in</text>
  <text start="570.54" dur="6.18">early 2007 we didn&amp;#39;t start to really</text>
  <text start="573.33" dur="6.629">accelerate until mid 2008 even a large</text>
  <text start="576.72" dur="5.88">unraveling takes a while and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="579.959" dur="4.921">starting to see the economy start to</text>
  <text start="582.6" dur="5.55">roll over and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="584.88" dur="6.209">things completely break down now he says</text>
  <text start="588.15" dur="5.55">what you see when the liquidity dries up</text>
  <text start="591.089" dur="4.111">is people start going down and this is</text>
  <text start="593.7" dur="4.05">the beginning of the Chinese credit</text>
  <text start="595.2" dur="4.35">crisis and judging by the collapse in</text>
  <text start="597.75" dur="4.86">both Chinese stocks and bonds the</text>
  <text start="599.55" dur="6.33">deleveraging is accelerating right now</text>
  <text start="602.61" dur="5.52">and what we are seeing is a complete</text>
  <text start="605.88" dur="5.37">breakdown of the system remember what</text>
  <text start="608.13" dur="6.27">they did back in 2008 they pumped in all</text>
  <text start="611.25" dur="5.01">this free money and it wasn&amp;#39;t just here</text>
  <text start="614.4" dur="4.95">in the United States the Fed did this</text>
  <text start="616.26" dur="6.78">around the world to pump the global</text>
  <text start="619.35" dur="6.48">economy up to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="623.04" dur="5.79">the economy was still strong was still</text>
  <text start="625.83" dur="5.699">surviving and getting better and they</text>
  <text start="628.83" dur="5.27">use this for the last eight to nine</text>
  <text start="631.529" dur="5.821">years right now well what&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="634.1" dur="5.47">they&amp;#39;ve blown this up so far that they</text>
  <text start="637.35" dur="5.04">can&amp;#39;t do it anymore they notice they</text>
  <text start="639.57" dur="5.82">realizes they understand that we are at</text>
  <text start="642.39" dur="5.34">a point where nothing else will help</text>
  <text start="645.39" dur="4.92">this is why they&amp;#39;re starting to raise</text>
  <text start="647.73" dur="4.26">the interest rates this is why the Fed</text>
  <text start="650.31" dur="3.719">was out there saying that oh this</text>
  <text start="651.99" dur="4.68">economic situation that we&amp;#39;re in it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.029" dur="4.891">really transitory it&amp;#39;s going to improve</text>
  <text start="656.67" dur="4.2">in the next quarter and remember their</text>
  <text start="658.92" dur="6.06">next Fed meeting comes up in June right</text>
  <text start="660.87" dur="5.46">in between the last GDP numbers and the</text>
  <text start="664.98" dur="3.45">GDP numbers are going to be coming out</text>
  <text start="666.33" dur="3.81">and most likely everyone will forget</text>
  <text start="668.43" dur="3.09">about the point seven percent the Fed</text>
  <text start="670.14" dur="2.699">will come out and say that the economy</text>
  <text start="671.52" dur="3.9">looks strong the labor market looks</text>
  <text start="672.839" dur="4.171">fantastic it it&amp;#39;s growing once again GDP</text>
  <text start="675.42" dur="3.539">looks a lot better even though the GDP</text>
  <text start="677.01" dur="5.28">numbers haven&amp;#39;t come out and they will</text>
  <text start="678.959" dur="4.831">raise the rate once again and the</text>
  <text start="682.29" dur="3.66">corporate media will play it up and say</text>
  <text start="683.79" dur="4.919">that the economy is strong and this is</text>
  <text start="685.95" dur="5.73">why the Fed is doing this because they</text>
  <text start="688.709" dur="5.221">can&amp;#39;t go backwards right now and they</text>
  <text start="691.68" dur="3.57">can&amp;#39;t hold the interest rates after they</text>
  <text start="693.93" dur="3.24">told everyone they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="695.25" dur="3.69">raising it to three times during the</text>
  <text start="697.17" dur="3.24">year because if they continually hold it</text>
  <text start="698.94" dur="3.66">throughout the year they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="700.41" dur="4.619">lose credibility and people are going to</text>
  <text start="702.6" dur="5.19">start to realize that the economy is not</text>
  <text start="705.029" dur="6.75">what they&amp;#39;re saying it is so they are</text>
  <text start="707.79" dur="7.41">forced right now to raise the interest</text>
  <text start="711.779" dur="6.511">rates they cannot do a 180 and start</text>
  <text start="715.2" dur="6.57">lowering the rates just yet the only way</text>
  <text start="718.29" dur="5.97">they can do this is when the economy</text>
  <text start="721.77" dur="5.61">starts to fall apart they want to hit</text>
  <text start="724.26" dur="7.05">that trigger point where the economy</text>
  <text start="727.38" dur="5.88">starts to rapidly degrade and fall apart</text>
  <text start="731.31" dur="4.77">now we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this all along the</text>
  <text start="733.26" dur="5.16">economy is falling apart the economy is</text>
  <text start="736.08" dur="4.44">getting worse it is rolling over right</text>
  <text start="738.42" dur="5.28">now they just want to put it over the</text>
  <text start="740.52" dur="5.73">edge they want it to start heading down</text>
  <text start="743.7" dur="6.21">that hill and they want it to gain speed</text>
  <text start="746.25" dur="6.27">why because their end result is you need</text>
  <text start="749.91" dur="4.08">us you need the Fed and of course</text>
  <text start="752.52" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;ll point the finger at Trump at</text>
  <text start="753.99" dur="4.11">this point saying look what he just did</text>
  <text start="755.76" dur="3.96">from all his policies remember they</text>
  <text start="758.1" dur="3.54">needed him to be in the White House for</text>
  <text start="759.72" dur="5.28">a certain period of time so they can</text>
  <text start="761.64" dur="7.2">blame what is about to happen he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="765" dur="5.7">in there and it is now may if they start</text>
  <text start="768.84" dur="4.2">raising the rates now which they have</text>
  <text start="770.7" dur="5.55">been and they raise it again in June</text>
  <text start="773.04" dur="6.66">then maybe in August that will trigger</text>
  <text start="776.25" dur="5.76">the entire system coming down that will</text>
  <text start="779.7" dur="5.49">be enough time to start blaming it on</text>
  <text start="782.01" dur="4.98">Trump now at the same time Trump on the</text>
  <text start="785.19" dur="4.23">other hand is trying to blow up these</text>
  <text start="786.99" dur="4.02">bubbles as fast as he possibly can to</text>
  <text start="789.42" dur="3.78">bring it down so he can control the</text>
  <text start="791.01" dur="4.05">narrative and blame it on the central</text>
  <text start="793.2" dur="5.25">bank and everything that is happening</text>
  <text start="795.06" dur="7.29">right now is because the economy it was</text>
  <text start="798.45" dur="5.46">never designed to last this long if you</text>
  <text start="802.35" dur="4.14">go back in time you can see the reserve</text>
  <text start="803.91" dur="5.64">currencies they only last 40 to 45 years</text>
  <text start="806.49" dur="6.15">then they collapse why because of too</text>
  <text start="809.55" dur="5.97">much debt and this is a pattern that</text>
  <text start="812.64" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing all along and here we</text>
  <text start="815.52" dur="5.43">are today we are at the end of this</text>
  <text start="818.43" dur="5.16">cycle this is why wages are going down</text>
  <text start="820.95" dur="4.41">this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing deflation this</text>
  <text start="823.59" dur="3.51">is why they had to manipulate all these</text>
  <text start="825.36" dur="3.33">statistics to make you think that</text>
  <text start="827.1" dur="3.96">everything is fine in their system is</text>
  <text start="828.69" dur="3.87">working just like it&amp;#39;s supposed to this</text>
  <text start="831.06" dur="2.88">is why in the beginning of their system</text>
  <text start="832.56" dur="2.82">they didn&amp;#39;t have to really manipulate</text>
  <text start="833.94" dur="3.27">anything because it was the beginning</text>
  <text start="835.38" dur="3.99">and there wasn&amp;#39;t that much debt they</text>
  <text start="837.21" dur="3.87">were just starting off the one thing</text>
  <text start="839.37" dur="4.29">they did have to do because they came</text>
  <text start="841.08" dur="5.37">off the gold standard was adjust for</text>
  <text start="843.66" dur="4.98">inflation because they were creating so</text>
  <text start="846.45" dur="4.5">much currency and the currency lost</text>
  <text start="848.64" dur="3.87">value because it came off the gold</text>
  <text start="850.95" dur="3.66">standard this is why everyone got a</text>
  <text start="852.51" dur="3">raise back in the 70s this is why</text>
  <text start="854.61" dur="3.63">housing</text>
  <text start="855.51" dur="4.17">went up so fast this is why we saw all</text>
  <text start="858.24" dur="4.2">this happening that&amp;#39;s why the interest</text>
  <text start="859.68" dur="5.12">rates were so high now we see the</text>
  <text start="862.44" dur="7.38">opposite we&amp;#39;re on the opposite end</text>
  <text start="864.8" dur="8.83">40-plus years later and we are looking</text>
  <text start="869.82" dur="5.73">at a collapse scenario so get ready get</text>
