  <text start="34.08" dur="5.64">date is March seventeenth 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="37.769" dur="4.021">title this episode is the perfect</text>
  <text start="39.72" dur="4.56">economic storm is now forming and it</text>
  <text start="41.79" dur="3.99">will collapse the economy and for those</text>
  <text start="44.28" dur="4.199">people who are celebrating st. Patrick&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="45.78" dur="5.209">Day happy st. Patrick&amp;#39;s Day let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="48.479" dur="5.131">right into the economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="50.989" dur="4.691">we&amp;#39;re going to head out Cyprus and what</text>
  <text start="53.61" dur="3.659">is happening out there well pretty much</text>
  <text start="55.68" dur="4.799">the same thing that&amp;#39;s been happening all</text>
  <text start="57.269" dur="6.54">along they used the bail in documents it</text>
  <text start="60.479" dur="5.791">was a test they wanted to see if the</text>
  <text start="63.809" dur="4.981">people would riot or they would rise up</text>
  <text start="66.27" dur="5.22">they did absolutely nothing they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="68.79" dur="6.06">stuck in this capital control type of</text>
  <text start="71.49" dur="5.61">situation for over a year now and right</text>
  <text start="74.85" dur="5.339">now the Cyprus finest finance minister</text>
  <text start="77.1" dur="5.64">is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying that you</text>
  <text start="80.189" dur="5.04">know what maybe by the end of spring of</text>
  <text start="82.74" dur="6.57">this year we will lift the capital</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="7.231">controls and the people of Cyprus they</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="6.659">still have a ban on cashing in checks</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="7.35">and a 300 euro cash withdrawal limit</text>
  <text start="95.969" dur="5.28">daily remains in for so they still can</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="4.71">get their money out we have to think</text>
  <text start="101.249" dur="6.091">back when they first implemented the</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="5.76">balance they told the people that they</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="5.699">would only have these capital controls</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="4.14">in effect for about two weeks then it</text>
  <text start="113.039" dur="3.241">went into a month then it went into</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="4.229">three months then it went into a year</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="5.85">and now it&amp;#39;s the end of spring which is</text>
  <text start="118.649" dur="4.83">really the end of May going into June at</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="3.57">this point and you know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="3.81">happen as we approach that date they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="4.26">going to extend it because what are they</text>
  <text start="127.289" dur="5.851">afraid of they&amp;#39;re afraid of every single</text>
  <text start="129.96" dur="5.339">person running to the bank and taking</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="4.98">all of their money out you also have to</text>
  <text start="135.299" dur="5.701">remember they also told the people of</text>
  <text start="138.12" dur="5.1">Cyprus that they were only taking out</text>
  <text start="141" dur="4.47">percent or so and then it went up to a</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="5.01">10 and then went up to 15 then all of a</text>
  <text start="145.47" dur="5.97">sudden everyone was getting forty seven</text>
  <text start="148.23" dur="4.89">percent taken out of their savings so we</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="4.2">can see this was completely planned</text>
  <text start="153.12" dur="5.61">nothing has changed all they do is</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="4.89">continually a they extend the timeline</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="4.2">of when they&amp;#39;re going to remove the</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="4.11">capital controls and again they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="162.93" dur="4.11">going to do it because they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.64" dur="4.89">going to happen they know the people are</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="5.84">going to make a huge run on the banks</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="7.62">but again all of this is in preparation</text>
  <text start="172.88" dur="5.77">for this perfect economic storm and what</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="3.51">I mean by that if we take a look around</text>
  <text start="178.65" dur="3.6">and we see what&amp;#39;s happening and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="180.66" dur="3.96">talking about the stock market we know</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s in a bubble we know the Fed the</text>
  <text start="184.62" dur="4.02">US government the banks are all</text>
  <text start="186.66" dur="6.48">controlling that money has been pumped</text>
  <text start="188.64" dur="6.78">into that to pump this up to as high as</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="4.319">it possibly can go until the entire</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="3.569">system comes crashing down but if we</text>
  <text start="197.459" dur="3.271">look at other indicators and we look</text>
  <text start="198.989" dur="3.511">around the United States and especially</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="4.289">in Europe right now because this is</text>
  <text start="202.5" dur="5.4">really mimicking the reefs the</text>
  <text start="205.019" dur="5.311">depression of 1929 we&amp;#39;re seeing Europe</text>
  <text start="207.9" dur="5.309">is in a recession / depression I mean</text>
  <text start="210.33" dur="4.53">that the amount of unemployment the</text>
  <text start="213.209" dur="4.471">amount of debt that these countries have</text>
  <text start="214.86" dur="4.74">people are finding it very difficult to</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="5.43">make ends meet and it is it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="6.48">very very hard on the people but if we</text>
  <text start="223.11" dur="5.28">look in the United States also we see</text>
  <text start="226.08" dur="6.09">indicators we see retail businesses</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="7.379">going out of business one retail chain</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="6.93">after another and we see store closing</text>
  <text start="235.769" dur="5.841">one retail chain after another now we</text>
  <text start="239.1" dur="4.65">did I did report that Sbarro&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="241.61" dur="5.56">declared bankruptcy they closed about</text>
  <text start="243.75" dur="4.829">155 stores quiznos now is also declaring</text>
  <text start="247.17" dur="4.68">bankruptcy and now there&amp;#39;s a report out</text>
  <text start="248.579" dur="5.011">there that office depot is it expecting</text>
  <text start="251.85" dur="3.3">to shed some of the excess stores</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="3.48">created by its recent purchase of</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="5.399">officemax so we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="257.07" dur="6.3">additional stores closed and again the</text>
  <text start="260.549" dur="5.911">same thing with men&amp;#39;s wearhouse with jos</text>
  <text start="263.37" dur="4.71">a bank jos a bank and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="266.46" dur="4.74">be closing more stores and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="6.4">to see this trend continue as we go</text>
  <text start="271.2" dur="9.4">further into 2014 because again all</text>
  <text start="274.48" dur="8.67">retail corporations they were depending</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="4.98">on the holiday season to get them</text>
  <text start="283.15" dur="5.28">through the entire year and guess what</text>
  <text start="285.58" dur="6.66">happened the holiday season did not go</text>
  <text start="288.43" dur="6.15">anywhere it the sales were completely</text>
  <text start="292.24" dur="4.35">down they pumped the stores full of</text>
  <text start="294.58" dur="4.41">inventory they can&amp;#39;t get rid of it and</text>
  <text start="296.59" dur="4.26">they know it and they&amp;#39;re realizing that</text>
  <text start="298.99" dur="3.57">they need to get rid of all these stores</text>
  <text start="300.85" dur="5.99">we got to lay off all these people and</text>
  <text start="302.56" dur="7.02">this is why we see Macy&amp;#39;s jcpenney</text>
  <text start="306.84" dur="6.97">RadioShack all closing hundreds of</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="6.6">stores sbarro build a bear all doing the</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="5.16">same exact thing barnes and noble target</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="7.11">best buy and we&amp;#39;re going to see more and</text>
  <text start="318.97" dur="6.99">more of these stores start to close now</text>
  <text start="323.29" dur="5.76">what else are we seeing that is setting</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="5.7">up this entire perfect storm well the</text>
  <text start="329.05" dur="4.95">housing market and we realize right now</text>
  <text start="331.66" dur="6.03">the housing market is in terrible shape</text>
  <text start="334" dur="5.04">of course when from the outside and from</text>
  <text start="337.69" dur="3.54">what people are seeing there seeing home</text>
  <text start="339.04" dur="4.17">prices going up but they&amp;#39;re reaching the</text>
  <text start="341.23" dur="5.25">top of the bubble here but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="6.06">seeing are all the indicators leading up</text>
  <text start="346.48" dur="6.69">to the implosion of the housing market</text>
  <text start="349.27" dur="7.5">we see as of 2013 between august and</text>
  <text start="353.17" dur="7.11">october and going forward we see many of</text>
  <text start="356.77" dur="6.21">the major mortgage companies going out</text>
  <text start="360.28" dur="5.91">of business or laying off thousands upon</text>
  <text start="362.98" dur="5.34">thousands of people we also see mortgage</text>
  <text start="366.19" dur="4.89">applications plunging by sixty-six</text>
  <text start="368.32" dur="5.82">percent home builder confidence misses</text>
  <text start="371.08" dur="5.52">expectations again future sales</text>
  <text start="374.14" dur="5.28">expectations dropped once again to 10</text>
  <text start="376.6" dur="5.34">month losed the West plunged and the</text>
  <text start="379.42" dur="5.21">northeast drop to multi-year lows and</text>
  <text start="381.94" dur="7.2">guess what I mentioned this on Saturday</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="7.36">Blackstone they are trying to unload as</text>
  <text start="389.14" dur="5.79">many properties as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="5.43">because they realize the housing market</text>
  <text start="394.93" dur="5.94">has reached the top and now it&amp;#39;s time to</text>
  <text start="397.42" dur="6.33">get out they need retail investors of</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="5.01">homes or the ordinary everyday person to</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="4.35">purchase these homes to get rid of it</text>
  <text start="405.88" dur="5.07">but they are having a very rough time</text>
  <text start="408.1" dur="5.4">because people just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="410.95" dur="3.9">capital to purchase these homes and this</text>
  <text start="413.5" dur="6.45">is the problem that they&amp;#39;re all running</text>
  <text start="414.85" dur="7.35">into plus we see foreclosures in the the</text>
  <text start="419.95" dur="4.56">main areas in the Northeast and on the</text>
  <text start="422.2" dur="5.49">west they&amp;#39;re all increasing the</text>
  <text start="424.51" dur="5.22">percentage of foreclosures going up what</text>
  <text start="427.69" dur="4.92">else are we saying well manufacturing</text>
  <text start="429.73" dur="5.82">misses for the seventh month of the last</text>
  <text start="432.61" dur="5.46">eight the outlook completely plunges</text>
  <text start="435.55" dur="4.47">right now March data once again fell</text>
  <text start="438.07" dur="4.35">below the consensus the general business</text>
  <text start="440.02" dur="5.94">conditions six months ahead fell by the</text>
  <text start="442.42" dur="8.79">most since October 2011 to its lowest</text>
  <text start="445.96" dur="8.82">since July 2013 so again this is not</text>
  <text start="451.21" dur="7.47">going well at all and February&amp;#39;s biggest</text>
  <text start="454.78" dur="6.36">miss on more auto inventory stacking</text>
  <text start="458.68" dur="4.77">again we understand the automobile is</text>
  <text start="461.14" dur="4.77">producing cars like crazy they are</text>
  <text start="463.45" dur="4.74">channel stuffing they&amp;#39;re pushing more</text>
  <text start="465.91" dur="4.62">and more cars on to the dealer lots and</text>
  <text start="468.19" dur="4.77">guess what the people are just not</text>
  <text start="470.53" dur="4.56">buying these cars and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="472.96" dur="4.38">is a seven point four percent surge in</text>
  <text start="475.09" dur="4.65">Motor Vehicles the biggest in at least</text>
  <text start="477.34" dur="4.29">six months which are already sitting a</text>
  <text start="479.74" dur="4.32">record levels of absolute inventories</text>
  <text start="481.63" dur="5.25">and the highest in frontera to sales</text>
  <text start="484.06" dur="4.35">since the financial crisis indexes for</text>
  <text start="486.88" dur="4.47">consumer durables and consumer</text>
  <text start="488.41" dur="5.76">non-energy non-durables moved up 2.1</text>
  <text start="491.35" dur="6.06">percent and point nine percent and again</text>
  <text start="494.17" dur="5.52">the production of automobiles jumped</text>
  <text start="497.41" dur="4.2">four point six percent of course we got</text>
  <text start="499.69" dur="3.51">to make these GDP numbers look good we</text>
  <text start="501.61" dur="4.11">got to show that there&amp;#39;s manufacturing</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="4.89">going on even though all of this is</text>
  <text start="505.72" dur="4.14">completely fake and it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="508.09" dur="3.81">illusion because all these cars are just</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="4.53">sitting on a lot no one&amp;#39;s coming to</text>
  <text start="511.9" dur="5.88">purchase them and this is the main</text>
  <text start="514.39" dur="6.48">problem that they&amp;#39;re having now all of</text>
  <text start="517.78" dur="6.24">this information will become completely</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="7.38">irrelevant why because in 11 days the</text>
  <text start="524.02" dur="6.03">Fed will revise the entire data serious</text>
  <text start="528.25" dur="3.66">well of course to make things look</text>
  <text start="530.05" dur="3.57">better because right now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="531.91" dur="4.02">looking good at all so what do they do</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="4.8">they step in they step in and they start</text>
  <text start="535.93" dur="4.62">manipulating all the numbers the Federal</text>
  <text start="538.42" dur="3.51">Reserve Board plans to issue its annual</text>
  <text start="540.55" dur="4.05">revision to the in debt</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="5.219">of ended industrial production and the</text>
  <text start="544.6" dur="6.42">related measures of capacity utilization</text>
  <text start="547.149" dur="6.69">at noon on march 28 2014 the revised</text>
  <text start="551.02" dur="4.83">indexes will incorporate data from the</text>
  <text start="553.839" dur="4.5">US Geological Survey regarding metallic</text>
  <text start="555.85" dur="5.07">and nonmetallic materials except for</text>
  <text start="558.339" dur="4.591">fuels the update will also include</text>
  <text start="560.92" dur="4.8">revisions to the monthly indicators and</text>
  <text start="562.93" dur="5.099">to seasonal factors for each industry in</text>
  <text start="565.72" dur="4.83">addition the estimation methods for some</text>
  <text start="568.029" dur="5.011">series may be changed any modifications</text>
  <text start="570.55" dur="4.5">to the methods for estimating the output</text>
  <text start="573.04" dur="4.62">of an industry will affect the index</text>
  <text start="575.05" dur="4.86">from 1972 to the present so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.66" dur="4.61">going to go back in time revised things</text>
  <text start="579.91" dur="6.06">to the present we saw this happen with</text>
  <text start="582.27" dur="6.61">inflation we saw this happen with GDP</text>
  <text start="585.97" dur="5.28">and here we are again doing the same</text>
  <text start="588.88" dur="5.28">exact thing because they need to</text>
  <text start="591.25" dur="5.43">manipulate these numbers to fit their</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="4.679">illusion and if it doesn&amp;#39;t fit they just</text>
  <text start="596.68" dur="3.659">change them that&amp;#39;s all they do and</text>
  <text start="598.839" dur="4.201">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this and</text>
  <text start="600.339" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re taking it one step further well</text>
  <text start="603.04" dur="3.69">since we don&amp;#39;t have that much</text>
  <text start="604.899" dur="3.751">manufacturing going on here in the</text>
  <text start="606.73" dur="4.26">United States what they&amp;#39;re good but</text>
  <text start="608.65" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re deciding to do let&amp;#39;s just change</text>
  <text start="610.99" dur="5.76">the definition of manufacturing very</text>
  <text start="614.35" dur="3.6">simple so now we&amp;#39;ll have manufacturing</text>
  <text start="616.75" dur="4.68">in the United States because we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="617.95" dur="6.3">to change what a manufacturer is so what</text>
  <text start="621.43" dur="5.159">exactly are they going to do well those</text>
  <text start="624.25" dur="4.68">firms that are factory factory lists</text>
  <text start="626.589" dur="4.021">goods producers firms that handle every</text>
  <text start="628.93" dur="4.44">part of making their products except the</text>
  <text start="630.61" dur="5.04">actual creation of the products those</text>
  <text start="633.37" dur="6.77">will now be called manufacturers and</text>
  <text start="635.65" dur="7.08">again what this does is it allows the</text>
  <text start="640.14" dur="5.08">government the Fed to show that there is</text>
  <text start="642.73" dur="4.5">manufacturing going on and again the</text>
  <text start="645.22" dur="4.08">upshot would be an overnight increase in</text>
  <text start="647.23" dur="5.01">the apparent size of the US industrial</text>
  <text start="649.3" dur="5.37">sector without adding a single assembly</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="4.71">line this is fantastic backers of the</text>
  <text start="654.67" dur="4.169">change say this would give a truer</text>
  <text start="656.95" dur="4.68">picture of the nation&amp;#39;s productive</text>
  <text start="658.839" dur="4.951">capability because these firms still do</text>
  <text start="661.63" dur="4.35">most other functions of manufacturing</text>
  <text start="663.79" dur="4.23">from designing goods to overseeing their</text>
  <text start="665.98" dur="4.59">production and distribution but again</text>
  <text start="668.02" dur="4.98">there is actually no manufacturing going</text>

  <text start="1341" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re going to invade there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1342.38" dur="5.46">be war but Putin if you really look at</text>
  <text start="1344.99" dur="5.819">his actions this is not exactly how he</text>
  <text start="1347.84" dur="5.1">moves again if he really wanted war he</text>
  <text start="1350.809" dur="4.441">would have led the United States go into</text>
  <text start="1352.94" dur="3.9">Syria Russia would have got involved and</text>
  <text start="1355.25" dur="4.86">we would have had world war three at</text>
  <text start="1356.84" dur="6.48">that point again look at his actions not</text>
  <text start="1360.11" dur="7.17">the propaganda of the media right now</text>
  <text start="1363.32" dur="8.31">Putin has had naval officers cities</text>
  <text start="1367.28" dur="7.59">towns all come to him Crimea voted to</text>
  <text start="1371.63" dur="6.179">remove itself from Ukraine and join with</text>
  <text start="1374.87" dur="5.67">Russia without troops without firing a</text>
  <text start="1377.809" dur="5.281">shot without having a coup or anything</text>
  <text start="1380.54" dur="5.129">like that and now Russia is saying to</text>
  <text start="1383.09" dur="6.75">America and German inspectors guess what</text>
  <text start="1385.669" dur="6.901">fly over Russia using the open sky</text>
  <text start="1389.84" dur="5.219">treaty and you can see for yourself that</text>
  <text start="1392.57" dur="4.71">we do not have any type of troop</text>
  <text start="1395.059" dur="4.201">build-up and the flights will be</text>

  <text start="1403.19" dur="4.53">national nuclear threat reduction center</text>
  <text start="1405.799" dur="4.081">and again they&amp;#39;re going to fly over to</text>
  <text start="1407.72" dur="6.089">verify true position of Russian troops</text>
  <text start="1409.88" dur="6.51">and military equipment now we understand</text>
  <text start="1413.809" dur="5.281">that Yatsenyuk which is the I guess</text>
  <text start="1416.39" dur="6.18">temporary Prime Minister the acting</text>
  <text start="1419.09" dur="5.67">Prime Minister he was not voted in none</text>
  <text start="1422.57" dur="4.62">of the government in Ukraine has been</text>
  <text start="1424.76" dur="4.65">voted in they&amp;#39;ve been put into positions</text>
  <text start="1427.19" dur="4.02">and there has been no election</text>
  <text start="1429.41" dur="3.81">whatsoever because they&amp;#39;re very nervous</text>
  <text start="1431.21" dur="3.42">if they actually had an election these</text>
  <text start="1433.22" dur="5.15">people would be voted out and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1434.63" dur="8.1">they didn&amp;#39;t have one Yatsenyuk visited</text>
  <text start="1438.37" dur="6.54">the president and what has been coming</text>
  <text start="1442.73" dur="6.27">out of this is that he brought over some</text>
  <text start="1444.91" dur="6.19">Scythian gold to the US and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1449" dur="5.37">saying it&amp;#39;s worth about twenty billion</text>
  <text start="1451.1" dur="5.88">dollars worth of natural cultural values</text>
  <text start="1454.37" dur="5.34">and these values might become guarantees</text>
  <text start="1456.98" dur="5.28">for the international monetary fund loan</text>
  <text start="1459.71" dur="4.05">so again we understand that the Fed the</text>
  <text start="1462.26" dur="4.62">United States government flew in with</text>
  <text start="1463.76" dur="5.64">unmarked planes and took Ukrainian gold</text>
  <text start="1466.88" dur="3.85">out of the country and flew away with it</text>
  <text start="1469.4" dur="4.68">we don&amp;#39;t know where it went</text>
  <text start="1470.73" dur="7.29">and here we are again seeing more of the</text>
  <text start="1474.08" dur="6.729">assets of the country being removed this</text>
  <text start="1478.02" dur="5.01">is what the central bankers do the US</text>
  <text start="1480.809" dur="4.351">government this is what they do they go</text>
  <text start="1483.03" dur="3.99">into each one of these countries they</text>
  <text start="1485.16" dur="4.2">take the gold they take the natural</text>
  <text start="1487.02" dur="5.85">resources they put the country into a</text>
  <text start="1489.36" dur="5.58">huge amount of debt and this is how they</text>
  <text start="1492.87" dur="3.39">proceed with every single country in</text>
  <text start="1494.94" dur="3.989">those countries that do have natural</text>
  <text start="1496.26" dur="4.95">resources like oil they are put on the</text>
  <text start="1498.929" dur="4.681">US dollar and every single country then</text>
  <text start="1501.21" dur="4.349">has to use the US dollar to pay for that</text>
  <text start="1503.61" dur="4.17">oil and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="1505.559" dur="6.151">now now we all pretty much probably</text>
  <text start="1507.78" dur="6.63">understand that Crimea voted to join</text>
  <text start="1511.71" dur="4.38">Russia and not be a part of Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1514.41" dur="4.17">anymore and about ninety three percent</text>
  <text start="1516.09" dur="4.95">of voters in Crimean referendum have</text>
  <text start="1518.58" dur="5.07">answered yes to the autonomous republic</text>
  <text start="1521.04" dur="5.16">joining Russia and again the United</text>
  <text start="1523.65" dur="5.88">States is out there saying that they</text>
  <text start="1526.2" dur="5.4">will never recognize this referendum and</text>
  <text start="1529.53" dur="3.87">in a telephone call with Putin President</text>
  <text start="1531.6" dur="3.9">Obama emphasized that Crimean referendum</text>
  <text start="1533.4" dur="4.62">which violates the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="1535.5" dur="5.25">Constitution and occurred under duress</text>
  <text start="1538.02" dur="4.2">of Russian military intervention would</text>
  <text start="1540.75" dur="3.9">never be recognized by the United States</text>
  <text start="1542.22" dur="4.35">and the international community and this</text>
  <text start="1544.65" dur="4.92">is coming from the White House statement</text>
  <text start="1546.57" dur="4.92">and again this was not under Russian</text>
  <text start="1549.57" dur="4.08">duress if you look around at the polls</text>
  <text start="1551.49" dur="4.77">and you hear what people were saying and</text>
  <text start="1553.65" dur="4.8">other international journalists that</text>
  <text start="1556.26" dur="4.799">were there there were no Russian troops</text>
  <text start="1558.45" dur="4.83">there was no one at gunpoint this is all</text>
  <text start="1561.059" dur="4.201">propaganda to make you believe that</text>
  <text start="1563.28" dur="4.32">these people were forced but who is</text>
  <text start="1565.26" dur="4.32">actually forced and where was there an</text>
  <text start="1567.6" dur="5.819">actual coup oh that&amp;#39;s right when they</text>
  <text start="1569.58" dur="7.86">overthrew Ukrainian government when they</text>
  <text start="1573.419" dur="6.241">made an agreement and they basically</text>
  <text start="1577.44" dur="4.05">didn&amp;#39;t adhere to the agreement they just</text>
  <text start="1579.66" dur="3.93">overthrew the government forced everyone</text>
  <text start="1581.49" dur="4.8">out put the people in there as they</text>
  <text start="1583.59" dur="4.31">wanted had them start writing up and</text>
  <text start="1586.29" dur="4.32">drawing up the papers to join the EU</text>
  <text start="1587.9" dur="5.529">raided the gold shipped it out of the</text>
  <text start="1590.61" dur="5.55">country and everything is being held</text>
  <text start="1593.429" dur="5.841">together with force and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1596.16" dur="5.61">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now since Crimea</text>
  <text start="1599.27" dur="5.08">separated and is now joining Russia of</text>
  <text start="1601.77" dur="6.57">course they&amp;#39;re imposing sanctions</text>
  <text start="1604.35" dur="6.24">the EU is imposing sanctions on 21</text>
  <text start="1608.34" dur="5.31">Russian and Ukrainian officials the</text>
  <text start="1610.59" dur="6.06">United States is imposing sanctions on</text>
  <text start="1613.65" dur="5.97">11 Russian and Ukrainian fischels and</text>
  <text start="1616.65" dur="5.19">again these sanctions are going to do</text>
  <text start="1619.62" dur="4.679">absolutely nothing because most of the</text>
  <text start="1621.84" dur="5.1">officials knew that this was coming and</text>
  <text start="1624.299" dur="6.481">most of them took their money out</text>
  <text start="1626.94" dur="6.33">already and again this is just something</text>
  <text start="1630.78" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re doing to show that the United</text>
  <text start="1633.27" dur="3.69">States and the EU can do something</text>
  <text start="1635.13" dur="3.99">because there&amp;#39;s nothing left for them to</text>
  <text start="1636.96" dur="4.349">do at this point because their backs are</text>
  <text start="1639.12" dur="5.37">against the wall they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1641.309" dur="5.73">maneuver some type of an event to occur</text>
  <text start="1644.49" dur="4.2">to get some type of war started they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1647.039" dur="3.691">been trying to use the propaganda that</text>
  <text start="1648.69" dur="3.45">Russia has been invading Ukraine they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1650.73" dur="4.23">going to be in there at any minute they</text>
  <text start="1652.14" dur="4.8">have 200,000 troops on the borders which</text>
  <text start="1654.96" dur="3.99">is absolutely ridiculous because now</text>
  <text start="1656.94" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re flying over the countries with</text>
  <text start="1658.95" dur="5.849">the Swiss to prove that this is</text>
  <text start="1660.84" dur="7.68">completely false and again they need an</text>
  <text start="1664.799" dur="7.771">event to move their war agenda forward</text>
  <text start="1668.52" dur="6.59">because they understand this economy the</text>
  <text start="1672.57" dur="7.05">private western central bank economy is</text>
  <text start="1675.11" dur="6.73">completely imploding on itself now</text>
  <text start="1679.62" dur="5.34">Russia since the sanctions came on some</text>
  <text start="1681.84" dur="6.15">of their Russian officials Russian now</text>
  <text start="1684.96" dur="5.82">is hinting it may force Ukraine into</text>
  <text start="1687.99" dur="5.939">default may ask Ukraine for its twenty</text>
  <text start="1690.78" dur="7.769">billion chair for ex-soviet debt so</text>
  <text start="1693.929" dur="7.49">again russia holds all the cards they</text>
  <text start="1698.549" dur="6.151">have strong manufacturing they are</text>
  <text start="1701.419" dur="6.401">basically teamed up with China and other</text>
  <text start="1704.7" dur="5.459">nations they hold a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="1707.82" dur="5.55">they hold a huge amount of dollar</text>
  <text start="1710.159" dur="6.541">reserves and again they could implode</text>
  <text start="1713.37" dur="5.58">the economy if they really wanted to and</text>
  <text start="1716.7" dur="3.87">if you really look at this the central</text>
  <text start="1718.95" dur="3.599">bankers US government would actually</text>
  <text start="1720.57" dur="4.29">like that because this would allow them</text>
  <text start="1722.549" dur="4.471">to go to war with Russia if Russia went</text>
  <text start="1724.86" dur="4.47">went ahead and said you know what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1727.02" dur="4.889">dumping all the Treasuries the central</text>
  <text start="1729.33" dur="4.829">bankers would probably most likely like</text>
  <text start="1731.909" dur="4.231">this scenario and they would like this</text>
  <text start="1734.159" dur="3.601">because again they need an event to get</text>
  <text start="1736.14" dur="3.6">started they need to cover the second</text>
  <text start="1737.76" dur="4.8">collapse they can manipulate the numbers</text>
  <text start="1739.74" dur="6.09">as much as they possibly can but after a</text>
  <text start="1742.56" dur="7.58">while fake can just cover up fake so</text>
  <text start="1745.83" dur="7.26">much now in another move Putin is</text>
  <text start="1750.14" dur="5.41">responding to us European sanction he</text>
  <text start="1753.09" dur="6.03">signs order recognizing Crimea as a</text>
  <text start="1755.55" dur="6.87">sovereign state so that has been pushed</text>
  <text start="1759.12" dur="6.5">for now of course obama declares that</text>
  <text start="1762.42" dur="5.79">support for Crimean self-determination</text>
  <text start="1765.62" dur="4.15">constitutes and an unusual and</text>
  <text start="1768.21" dur="3.06">extraordinary threat to the national</text>
  <text start="1769.77" dur="3.36">security and foreign policy of the</text>

  <text start="1773.13" dur="4.17">national emergency to deal with that</text>
  <text start="1774.78" dur="6.63">threat and this is all propaganda</text>
  <text start="1777.3" dur="5.7">building this up and of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1781.41" dur="4.46">seeing this all over the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1783" dur="6.48">and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="1785.87" dur="5.62">Russia is going to do something which we</text>
  <text start="1789.48" dur="3.69">know they are actually not going to do</text>
  <text start="1791.49" dur="4.89">because they already did it they already</text>
  <text start="1793.17" dur="8.64">got Crimea away from Ukraine and to join</text>
  <text start="1796.38" dur="7.47">Russia now we understand in Libya that</text>
  <text start="1801.81" dur="4.47">militia pretty much they&amp;#39;re holding</text>
  <text start="1803.85" dur="4.59">control of Libya they hold control of</text>
  <text start="1806.28" dur="4.62">the ports and they were filling up this</text>
  <text start="1808.44" dur="3.72">North Korean oil tanker which is really</text>
  <text start="1810.9" dur="6.15">not North Korean which is really</text>
  <text start="1812.16" dur="6.84">Egyptian and this North Korea oil tanker</text>
  <text start="1817.05" dur="4.56">you know sailed out they fired upon it</text>
  <text start="1819" dur="5.01">was on fire but i guess it was captured</text>
  <text start="1821.61" dur="4.83">and brought back because the united</text>
  <text start="1824.01" dur="3.81">states navy commando seized a and</text>
  <text start="1826.44" dur="4.17">diverted an oil tanker in the</text>

  <text start="1835.23" dur="5.07">its contents on the black market the</text>
  <text start="1837.33" dur="5.58">Pentagon said and of course the central</text>
  <text start="1840.3" dur="7.05">bankers the US government is not going</text>
  <text start="1842.91" dur="7.77">to allow the Libyan people to sell this</text>
  <text start="1847.35" dur="7.38">oil not using the US dollar so what did</text>
  <text start="1850.68" dur="7.23">they do they sent in the Navy SEALs to</text>
  <text start="1854.73" dur="5.34">get the oil tanker back this is how</text>
  <text start="1857.91" dur="6.48">desperate they are to do this right now</text>
  <text start="1860.07" dur="7.29">because the Libyan people are much</text>
  <text start="1864.39" dur="5.31">stronger they&amp;#39;re organized they are</text>
  <text start="1867.36" dur="4.11">pushing the government the puppet</text>
  <text start="1869.7" dur="4.53">government i should say out</text>
  <text start="1871.47" dur="4.26">abia and this is the biggest threat to</text>
  <text start="1874.23" dur="2.699">the central bankers and the US</text>
  <text start="1875.73" dur="3.27">government because if they completely</text>
