  <text start="911.66" dur="4.54">they believe they&amp;#39;re above the US</text>
  <text start="914.22" dur="6.63">government and they&amp;#39;ll never let this</text>
  <text start="916.2" dur="8.55">happen and we also know that why is the</text>
  <text start="920.85" dur="6.3">Fed in power think about it yes in 1913</text>
  <text start="924.75" dur="6.089">they snuck this law in the president</text>
  <text start="927.15" dur="6.09">help them at that time but why since</text>
  <text start="930.839" dur="6.421">that period of time has the Fed stayed</text>
  <text start="933.24" dur="5.52">in power what benefit do they add to the</text>
  <text start="937.26" dur="3.6">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="938.76" dur="4.199">I mean to the United says government not</text>
  <text start="940.86" dur="5.01">the central bankers they don&amp;#39;t add any</text>
  <text start="942.959" dur="4.471">benefit so why would they keep them the</text>
  <text start="945.87" dur="6">only reason they would keep them as if</text>
  <text start="947.43" dur="8.31">they&amp;#39;re receiving money currency from</text>
  <text start="951.87" dur="5.52">the Fed what other reason why because</text>
  <text start="955.74" dur="6.14">they have these incredible economic</text>
  <text start="957.39" dur="6.72">skills to keep the country balanced no</text>
  <text start="961.88" dur="8.55">because they&amp;#39;ve done such a wonderful</text>
  <text start="964.11" dur="9.51">job since they were created in 1913 know</text>
  <text start="970.43" dur="4.45">the only reason the Fed right now which</text>
  <text start="973.62" dur="7.469">is not part of the government whatsoever</text>
  <text start="974.88" dur="8.07">is in power is because they use free</text>
  <text start="981.089" dur="5.581">money which they create out of thin air</text>
  <text start="982.95" dur="8.55">and they give it to the government</text>
  <text start="986.67" dur="5.97">employees and this is how they control</text>
  <text start="991.5" dur="3.089">them there&amp;#39;s no other reason to keep</text>
  <text start="992.64" dur="7.71">them because the government has the</text>
  <text start="994.589" dur="7.291">ability to create its own currency they</text>
  <text start="1000.35" dur="3.359">don&amp;#39;t need the Fed there&amp;#39;s no reason if</text>
  <text start="1001.88" dur="5.72">they can create a Treasury bond they can</text>
  <text start="1003.709" dur="6.12">create currency if they can mint a coin</text>
  <text start="1007.6" dur="5.59">they have the ability plus it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="1009.829" dur="6.63">Constitution so there&amp;#39;s absolutely no</text>
  <text start="1013.19" dur="5.37">reason and right now we can see that all</text>
  <text start="1016.459" dur="5.281">the central banks around the world as</text>
  <text start="1018.56" dur="6.869">time goes on their losing control the</text>
  <text start="1021.74" dur="8.099">markets right now are fluctuating people</text>
  <text start="1025.429" dur="9.321">are losing faith and when this crashes</text>
  <text start="1029.839" dur="10.791">it will make 2008 look like a picnic</text>
  <text start="1034.75" dur="8.559">it&amp;#39;s going to be absolutely horrific and</text>
  <text start="1040.63" dur="6.16">of course what are they doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1043.309" dur="7.86">pushing carbon taxes they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="1046.79" dur="6">climate or global warming very very hard</text>
  <text start="1051.169" dur="2.701">right now because we&amp;#39;re coming out of</text>
  <text start="1052.79" dur="3.66">the summer month and I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you</text>
  <text start="1053.87" dur="4.91">right now this winter will probably be</text>
  <text start="1056.45" dur="7.14">one of the worst winters we&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text>
  <text start="1058.78" dur="7.779">because the entire earth is not</text>
  <text start="1063.59" dur="8.61">controlled by humans living on the</text>
  <text start="1066.559" dur="8.881">planet the climate here is controlled by</text>
  <text start="1072.2" dur="6.21">solar output I mean think about how long</text>
  <text start="1075.44" dur="5.13">the earth has been around and what has</text>
  <text start="1078.41" dur="4.44">happened to the earth do you really</text>
  <text start="1080.57" dur="4.37">think the humans on this planet are</text>
  <text start="1082.85" dur="6.36">really affecting what is going on here</text>
  <text start="1084.94" dur="6.13">now and it&amp;#39;s already proven because if</text>
  <text start="1089.21" dur="3.93">you look back at the time they told us</text>
  <text start="1091.07" dur="5.67">that all these ice sheets and everything</text>
  <text start="1093.14" dur="4.499">else was going to disappear well they</text>
  <text start="1096.74" dur="2.509">haven&amp;#39;t snow</text>
  <text start="1097.639" dur="3.48">still here actually it&amp;#39;s gotten worse I</text>
  <text start="1099.249" dur="4.33">remember when they showed his pictures</text>
  <text start="1101.119" dur="4.201">of polar bears floating around saying</text>
  <text start="1103.579" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re going to drown well that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1105.32" dur="8.339">complete lie because their hair is</text>
  <text start="1106.669" dur="9.96">hollow and it is created to float the</text>
  <text start="1113.659" dur="5.43">fat on the polar bear allows them to</text>
  <text start="1116.629" dur="4.59">float and their hairs are Hollow which</text>
  <text start="1119.089" dur="3.45">allows them to float and of course those</text>
  <text start="1121.219" dur="4.08">pictures were taken during the summer</text>
  <text start="1122.539" dur="4.38">months when the ice broke up but they</text>
  <text start="1125.299" dur="4.86">didn&amp;#39;t take him in the winter showing</text>
  <text start="1126.919" dur="4.8">the ice all together this is how they</text>
  <text start="1130.159" dur="3.21">lie to everyone now if you don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1131.719" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;re lying about that then there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1133.369" dur="4.02">reason to listen to me whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1134.539" dur="7.8">because you really then have to believe</text>
  <text start="1137.389" dur="7.681">their story about the economy how we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1142.339" dur="7.13">in the right going to war all across the</text>
  <text start="1145.07" dur="6.75">world but we see that this is not true</text>
  <text start="1149.469" dur="6.82">we see the government continually lies</text>
  <text start="1151.82" dur="6.829">and everything they say is always the</text>
  <text start="1156.289" dur="5.79">opposite I mean look at Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1158.649" dur="4.63">Obamacare when they were pushing it very</text>
  <text start="1162.079" dur="3.361">hard of course you couldn&amp;#39;t read it</text>
  <text start="1163.279" dur="3.56">because it was a secret they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1165.44" dur="4.079">anyone to know what was really in there</text>
  <text start="1166.839" dur="6.31">they told us and this is a quote from</text>
  <text start="1169.519" dur="6.72">the President Obama said back in 2008 by</text>
  <text start="1173.149" dur="7.11">reducing premiums by as much as 2500 per</text>
  <text start="1176.239" dur="11.16">family insurance will be affordable by</text>
  <text start="1180.259" dur="9.48">everybody well guess what since 2008 the</text>
  <text start="1187.399" dur="4.2">average family premium has climbed a</text>
  <text start="1189.739" dur="4.8">total of four thousand eight hundred and</text>
  <text start="1191.599" dur="6.69">sixty five dollars and more and more</text>
  <text start="1194.539" dur="7.74">people who are signing up can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="1198.289" dur="5.67">it and those who have signed up pay so</text>
  <text start="1202.279" dur="6.48">much that they&amp;#39;re eligible for food</text>
  <text start="1203.959" dur="7.231">stamps and if Obamacare doesn&amp;#39;t reach</text>
