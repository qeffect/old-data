  <text start="109.96" dur="8.7">and basically when you take his tweets</text>
  <text start="114.52" dur="7.62">it maps out the plan and it is</text>
  <text start="118.66" dur="6.06">completely in plain sight it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="122.14" dur="6">really hidden he&amp;#39;s been telling you this</text>
  <text start="124.72" dur="7.349">plan for a very long time and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="128.14" dur="6.599">about economic security which has to do</text>
  <text start="132.069" dur="5.821">with border security which has to do</text>
  <text start="134.739" dur="5.521">with making the playing field even</text>
  <text start="137.89" dur="4.879">across the world and of course we know</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="5.699">that globalism well that didn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="142.769" dur="5.921">actually did the opposite and this is</text>
  <text start="145.959" dur="5.581">why he&amp;#39;s dismantling all of this right</text>
  <text start="148.69" dur="5.189">now and we&amp;#39;re gonna be discussing this</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="3.839">plan and economic security a little bit</text>
  <text start="153.879" dur="3.541">later in this report let but let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="155.379" dur="5.461">start off with what&amp;#39;s happening here and</text>
  <text start="157.42" dur="6.899">how the mainstream media is trying to</text>
  <text start="160.84" dur="4.5">show that because of their shutdown all</text>
  <text start="164.319" dur="2.761">these different</text>
  <text start="165.34" dur="4.35">are happening like the weather forecast</text>
  <text start="167.08" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re not predicted correctly Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.69" dur="8.519">losing his base right now hope is fading</text>
  <text start="173.53" dur="6.63">because of the shutdown and everything</text>
  <text start="178.209" dur="4.261">is revolving around the shutdown and</text>
  <text start="180.16" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it seem like this</text>
  <text start="182.47" dur="4.98">is the worst thing ever remember the</text>
  <text start="185.17" dur="4.56">mainstream media the deep state the</text>
  <text start="187.45" dur="5.369">central bank they want everyone</text>
  <text start="189.73" dur="6.38">dependent on government and the longer</text>
  <text start="192.819" dur="7.071">their shutdown goes it shows that people</text>
  <text start="196.11" dur="7.18">really don&amp;#39;t need the government and</text>
  <text start="199.89" dur="6.55">people can survive without it</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="5.64">and if we go back to the founding</text>
  <text start="206.44" dur="6.18">fathers they wanted everyone to be</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="6.29">independent they didn&amp;#39;t want everyone to</text>
  <text start="212.62" dur="6">depend on the government for handouts</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="6.19">this is why they created this country</text>
  <text start="218.62" dur="5.06">without the central bank and there was a</text>
  <text start="221.41" dur="5.549">reason for this so people can get ahead</text>
  <text start="223.68" dur="6.16">once the central bank was introduced</text>
  <text start="226.959" dur="5.551">back in 1930 actually before that time</text>
  <text start="229.84" dur="6.48">but this is the third one in 1913 this</text>
  <text start="232.51" dur="5.819">is one everyone needed to depend on the</text>
  <text start="236.32" dur="5.52">government why because the central</text>
  <text start="238.329" dur="7.351">bank&amp;#39;s system does not help the</text>
  <text start="241.84" dur="5.19">population it helps very few but the</text>
  <text start="245.68" dur="4.77">majority of the population</text>
  <text start="247.03" dur="5.25">it doesn&amp;#39;t help and they know this and</text>
  <text start="250.45" dur="5.34">they know eventually what will happen is</text>
  <text start="252.28" dur="7.53">their paper currency will devalue over</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="6.06">time especially when they are allowed to</text>
  <text start="259.81" dur="4.609">just create currency out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="261.85" dur="6.45">continually do it and that means their</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="6.581">currency devalues people cannot live</text>
  <text start="268.3" dur="4.56">their everyday life and they had to</text>
  <text start="271" dur="4.41">create other things so people could live</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="6.47">which is called credit which enslaves</text>
  <text start="275.41" dur="7.47">the people the whole system is rigged</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="6.25">for the central banks and the government</text>
  <text start="282.88" dur="4.8">continually has to grow and grow and get</text>
  <text start="285.58" dur="5.91">bigger and bigger to support the</text>
  <text start="287.68" dur="5.34">population the founding fathers they</text>
  <text start="291.49" dur="2.82">didn&amp;#39;t want a central bank this is why</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="3.72">Andrew Jackson wouldn&amp;#39;t be talking about</text>
  <text start="294.31" dur="4.95">him a little bit later that&amp;#39;s why he</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="7.2">didn&amp;#39;t want the central bank that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="7.5">campaign to get rid of it he got rid of</text>
  <text start="303.94" dur="5.37">the second one we&amp;#39;re in the third</text>
  <text start="306.76" dur="5.84">central bank in this country if you</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="6.6">notice it continually pops up over time</text>
  <text start="312.6" dur="6.76">but Trump right now he is doing</text>
  <text start="315.91" dur="6.54">everything he possibly can to give the</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="6.33">United States economic security which is</text>
  <text start="322.45" dur="5.61">national security now already with China</text>
  <text start="325.69" dur="4.77">we know the trade delegation was out in</text>
  <text start="328.06" dur="4.41">China we know that Trump has been</text>
  <text start="330.46" dur="4.98">tweeting that there&amp;#39;s a trade deal on</text>
  <text start="332.47" dur="5.61">the horizon well China came out and they</text>
  <text start="335.44" dur="6.24">offered the US trade negotiators a six</text>
  <text start="338.08" dur="7.2">year boost in imports and what did they</text>
  <text start="341.68" dur="7.7">offer well they offered one trillion</text>
  <text start="345.28" dur="8.72">dollars over six years</text>
  <text start="349.38" dur="7.18">so to help reduce the trade imbalance</text>
  <text start="354" dur="4.39">China has offered to increase US imports</text>
  <text start="356.56" dur="5.28">by one trillion during the next six</text>
  <text start="358.39" dur="6.45">years is this enough no this is just the</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="5.46">beginning because we need to remember</text>
  <text start="364.84" dur="4.68">the globalists the elite the central</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="3.48">bank&amp;#39;s they were moving everything out</text>
  <text start="369.52" dur="4.74">of the country</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="6.81">Trump is fighting all of these forces to</text>
  <text start="374.26" dur="7.34">bring it back and it looks like he might</text>
  <text start="377.59" dur="7.83">be using leverage what do I mean by this</text>
  <text start="381.6" dur="8.49">or remember since Trump has become</text>
  <text start="385.42" dur="10.11">president he has all the information</text>
  <text start="390.09" dur="8.23">that the five eyes have he has all that</text>
  <text start="395.53" dur="4.92">data he knows what&amp;#39;s been going on</text>
  <text start="398.32" dur="3.8">remember the deep state has been using</text>
  <text start="400.45" dur="7.14">this information to blackmail</text>
  <text start="402.12" dur="7.81">politicians blackmailed judges blackmail</text>
  <text start="407.59" dur="3.17">other government officials in other</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="5.69">countries</text>
  <text start="410.76" dur="7.67">Trump has access to all of this</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="5.43">Trump has repeatedly stated that</text>
  <text start="418.43" dur="5.35">economic security is national security</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="7.76">and with that cornerstone is the</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="7.38">foundation any evidence of 5i Ally</text>
  <text start="428.81" dur="7.12">participating in the scheme against</text>
  <text start="431.16" dur="7.56">Trump becomes leverage now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="435.93" dur="5.01">interesting is that European official</text>
  <text start="438.72" dur="5.25">said they will make tariffs on steel</text>
  <text start="440.94" dur="5.46">imports to the region permanent to help</text>
  <text start="443.97" dur="4.92">stem the glut of supply sparked by Trump</text>
  <text start="446.4" dur="4.35">trade war against China the move</text>
  <text start="448.89" dur="4.38">highlights that protectionism is</text>
  <text start="450.75" dur="5.1">spreading and Trump trade war with China</text>
  <text start="453.27" dur="5.91">isn&amp;#39;t wrenching itself into the global</text>
  <text start="455.85" dur="5.79">economy the EU will impose quotas on 26</text>
  <text start="459.18" dur="4.56">product categories and levy 25 percent</text>
  <text start="461.64" dur="4.23">duty on imports exceeding those quotas</text>
  <text start="463.74" dur="4.05">the move cements proposals laid out last</text>
  <text start="465.87" dur="4.35">July with the stated aim of protecting</text>
  <text start="467.79" dur="6.39">European steel makers amid Chinese</text>
  <text start="470.22" dur="7.41">overcapacity hmm seems like all these</text>
  <text start="474.18" dur="6.27">countries are falling in line now</text>
  <text start="477.63" dur="4.71">remember Trump has 50 years of business</text>
  <text start="480.45" dur="4.47">skills and various predatory and</text>
  <text start="482.34" dur="5.01">adversarial financial deals leveraged or</text>
  <text start="484.92" dur="4.26">the ability to force an opponent to take</text>
  <text start="487.35" dur="4.25">an action that benefits your position is</text>
  <text start="489.18" dur="6.65">the most valuable weapon in deals in</text>
  <text start="491.6" dur="9.73">business or politics it&amp;#39;s all the same</text>
  <text start="495.83" dur="7.36">so what leverage is he is he using he</text>
  <text start="501.33" dur="5.46">might be using the leverage of the five</text>
  <text start="503.19" dur="7.32">eyes the declassification that</text>
  <text start="506.79" dur="7.5">implicates many individuals across the</text>
  <text start="510.51" dur="5.61">ocean and he could use this to get what</text>
  <text start="514.29" dur="4.59">he wants remember the five eyes those</text>
  <text start="516.12" dur="6.93">countries are Australia Canada New</text>
  <text start="518.88" dur="9">Zealand and the UK so what is Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.05" dur="9">primary objective save the US through</text>
  <text start="527.88" dur="5.9">economics economic security is national</text>
  <text start="532.05" dur="5.01">security he tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="533.78" dur="5.62">the United States has been reminded time</text>
  <text start="537.06" dur="4.41">again in recent years that economic</text>
  <text start="539.4" dur="5.42">security is not merely related to</text>
  <text start="541.47" dur="6.24">national security economic security is</text>
  <text start="544.82" dur="3.73">national security it is vital to our</text>
  <text start="547.71" dur="4.2">national</text>
  <text start="548.55" dur="7.5">strengths take a listen to what Trump</text>
  <text start="551.91" dur="6.42">said back in 2017 the United States has</text>
  <text start="556.05" dur="4.8">been reminded time and time again in</text>
  <text start="558.33" dur="5.96">recent years that economic security is</text>
  <text start="560.85" dur="7.19">not merely related to national security</text>
  <text start="564.29" dur="15.91">economic security is national security</text>
  <text start="568.04" dur="15.73">it is vital to our national strength we</text>
  <text start="580.2" dur="7.05">also know that we will not have lasting</text>
  <text start="583.77" dur="6.33">prosperity if we do not confront grave</text>
  <text start="587.25" dur="7.05">threats to security sovereignty and</text>
  <text start="590.1" dur="8.31">stability facing our world today this is</text>
  <text start="594.3" dur="7.5">all about national security which is</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="7.62">economic security this is why Trump is</text>
  <text start="601.8" dur="6.33">pushing so hard and all of those</text>
  <text start="606.03" dur="4.98">resistant politicians and their schemes</text>
  <text start="608.13" dur="5.88">their games their strategies their just</text>
  <text start="611.01" dur="7.95">annoying little flies that he&amp;#39;s swatting</text>
  <text start="614.01" dur="8.43">with every move that&amp;#39;s it Trump&amp;#39;s agenda</text>
  <text start="618.96" dur="5.37">is the primary focus the agenda is</text>
  <text start="622.44" dur="5.03">bigger much bigger and far more</text>
  <text start="624.33" dur="5.91">consequential than their obstruction</text>
  <text start="627.47" dur="3.79">remember this has been the plane going</text>
  <text start="630.24" dur="4.62">back many years</text>
  <text start="631.26" dur="8.82">remember Trump set back in 2017 economic</text>
  <text start="634.86" dur="7.88">security is national security the</text>
  <text start="640.08" dur="6.56">globalists were telling us the opposite</text>
  <text start="642.74" dur="7.48">so let&amp;#39;s look and let&amp;#39;s go back to 2011</text>
  <text start="646.64" dur="5.77">Trump has been telegraphing the plan for</text>
  <text start="650.22" dur="5.46">a very long time and the there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="652.41" dur="9.18">reason why he was tweeting this out back</text>
  <text start="655.68" dur="8.79">then October 25th 2011 printing money is</text>
