  <text start="64.559" dur="6.601">is the plan continues to unfold next</text>
  <text start="67.86" dur="5.16">phase has been launched let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="71.16" dur="4.05">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="5.099">geopolitical news now in yesterday&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="4.53">report we saw that the travel ban that</text>
  <text start="78.119" dur="3.211">Trump has been trying to get through</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="4.26">well it&amp;#39;s been shot down again by the</text>
  <text start="81.33" dur="4.61">Fourth Circuit Court and now he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="84" dur="4.59">to take it to the Supreme Court and</text>
  <text start="85.94" dur="5.17">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how that turns out and</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="4.74">we could see that the beep state they</text>
  <text start="91.11" dur="4.259">are trying to stop him at every turn and</text>
  <text start="93.33" dur="5.16">this is why a lot of things that he is</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="5.25">doing it is behind the scenes trying to</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="4.71">set things up and I&amp;#39;ll explain that in a</text>
  <text start="100.619" dur="5.941">little bit but first Jared Kushner right</text>
  <text start="103.2" dur="6.15">now it looks like the FBI is looking at</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="7.89">Jared Kushner for collusion with Russia</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="7.68">they&amp;#39;re saying that he is a target but</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="4.5">again they don&amp;#39;t have any evidence they</text>
  <text start="117.03" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t have anything there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="118.95" dur="3.33">looking into what he has been dealing</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="3.72">with has he been dealing with the</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="4.589">Russians and most likely he probably has</text>
  <text start="124.47" dur="4.2">been but does it mean that he&amp;#39;s dealing</text>
  <text start="126.869" dur="4.23">with them in the in a way where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="128.67" dur="4.62">Russian collusion or is he dealing with</text>
  <text start="131.099" dur="5.101">them in terms of business now the</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="6.09">Kirshner family the father of Jared</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="5.52">Kushner he was arrested he has a</text>
  <text start="139.38" dur="5.16">criminal background we see that Jared</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="6">Kushner yes he does some underhanded</text>
  <text start="144.54" dur="6.39">things and I don&amp;#39;t believe that he</text>
  <text start="147.72" dur="6.06">should be advising Trump in office right</text>
  <text start="150.93" dur="4.86">now I think he should be removed and it</text>
  <text start="153.78" dur="4.039">looks like Steve Bannon actually</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="4.26">mentioned this around two months ago</text>
  <text start="157.819" dur="4.121">where he expressed concerns that</text>
  <text start="160.05" dur="4.98">Kushner&amp;#39;s meeting with Russian officials</text>
  <text start="161.94" dur="5.64">could harm Trump&amp;#39;s presidency now does</text>
  <text start="165.03" dur="4.44">this mean it&amp;#39;s Russian collusion now</text>
  <text start="167.58" dur="3.3">just because you meet with Russians just</text>
  <text start="169.47" dur="3.18">because you&amp;#39;re doing business with</text>
  <text start="170.88" dur="3.27">Russians just because you&amp;#39;re Banking</text>
  <text start="172.65" dur="4.71">with Russians it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.15" dur="5.61">Russian collusion think about all the</text>
  <text start="177.36" dur="4.65">people that you do business with where</text>
  <text start="179.76" dur="4.679">the bank does business with where your</text>
  <text start="182.01" dur="4.53">money is and things like that I mean if</text>
  <text start="184.439" dur="2.681">you&amp;#39;re in business for yourself you</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="2.71">might</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="3.69">one day do business with someone that is</text>
  <text start="189.25" dur="3.39">Russian it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="190.81" dur="5.3">colluding with that individual you have</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="6.989">to prove that individuals are actually</text>
  <text start="196.11" dur="6.07">colluding and there was a plan a scheme</text>
  <text start="199.629" dur="5.041">you just can&amp;#39;t say well he did business</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="3.36">with Russia or Trump has done business</text>
  <text start="204.67" dur="3.03">with Russia</text>
  <text start="205.54" dur="4.289">so that&amp;#39;s Russian collusion and this is</text>
  <text start="207.7" dur="4.89">where they&amp;#39;re getting into the problem</text>
  <text start="209.829" dur="5.311">of trying to tell everyone that there is</text>
  <text start="212.59" dur="5.28">collusion because you need to prove that</text>
  <text start="215.14" dur="5.129">link yeah propaganda is great where you</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="5.04">can say like oh yes he had an investment</text>
  <text start="220.269" dur="4.56">with Russia or he spoke to a Russian but</text>
  <text start="222.91" dur="3.12">you really need to prove it beyond that</text>
  <text start="224.829" dur="4.02">and this is where they&amp;#39;re having the</text>
  <text start="226.03" dur="6.9">problem because they have nothing now</text>
  <text start="228.849" dur="7.2">the FBI is refusing to hand over commis</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="5.49">memos to Congress the House Oversight</text>
  <text start="236.049" dur="4.261">Committee Chairman jason Chaffetz said</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="3.78">that the FBI had decided to withhold</text>
  <text start="240.31" dur="4.59">documents including memos notes</text>
  <text start="242.2" dur="5.22">summaries and recordings requested by</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="6.059">his committee in regards to the ongoing</text>
  <text start="247.42" dur="6.48">Russian probe this was revealed in the</text>
  <text start="250.959" dur="4.5">letter sent by Chavez the FBI responding</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="4.139">to the agency&amp;#39;s decision to withhold the</text>
  <text start="255.459" dur="6">documents requested by the committee on</text>
  <text start="258.039" dur="5.491">May 16th now according to a statement by</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="4.68">the Oversight Committee Chaffetz</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="5.13">requested the memos notes some reason</text>
  <text start="266.139" dur="4.561">everything else to assist in the</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="4.77">committee&amp;#39;s investigation of the FBI&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.7" dur="4.56">independence and which are outside the</text>
  <text start="273.43" dur="5.1">scope of the special counsels</text>
  <text start="275.26" dur="6.629">investigation now the documents are due</text>
  <text start="278.53" dur="5.75">June 8th but that may not happen as it</text>
  <text start="281.889" dur="5.821">appears the FBI is suddenly unwilling to</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="6.31">cooperate the FBI is withholding those</text>
  <text start="287.71" dur="5.75">documents citing to the appointment of</text>
  <text start="290.59" dur="5.85">Robert Mueller as special prosecutor and</text>
  <text start="293.46" dur="5.65">Chaffetz says Congress and the American</text>
  <text start="296.44" dur="5.28">people well they have the right and duty</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="4.89">to examine this issue independently of</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="4.74">the special counsels investigation and</text>
  <text start="304" dur="5.61">he&amp;#39;s right we should be able to see all</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="5.73">this information I mean it was read to</text>
  <text start="309.61" dur="5.52">the New York Times a New York Times</text>
  <text start="312.19" dur="5.01">published what was read to them we</text>
  <text start="315.13" dur="3.99">should be able to see the memo I believe</text>
  <text start="317.2" dur="3.66">he&amp;#39;s right and that should be out there</text>
  <text start="319.12" dur="6.9">now it looks like</text>
  <text start="320.86" dur="6.989">Bannen is back and the escalating crisis</text>
  <text start="326.02" dur="4.889">surrounding the Russian investigation</text>
  <text start="327.849" dur="5.401">with the special council it looks like</text>
  <text start="330.909" dur="5.581">they brought Bannon back because he is</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="6.539">very good at handling this so he is now</text>
  <text start="336.49" dur="7.919">back working with Trump and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.789" dur="8.041">handling certain parts of the Russian</text>
  <text start="344.409" dur="6.841">investigation and he is going to help</text>
  <text start="347.83" dur="6.149">out in this area now I wanted to talk</text>
  <text start="351.25" dur="4.529">about what Trump has been doing out in</text>
  <text start="353.979" dur="4.53">the Middle East now we can see the</text>
  <text start="355.779" dur="4.98">corporate media they&amp;#39;ve been showing his</text>
  <text start="358.509" dur="3.78">speeches they&amp;#39;ve been you know picking</text>
  <text start="360.759" dur="3.18">apart his speech is actually Trump</text>
  <text start="362.289" dur="3.271">didn&amp;#39;t even write these speeches he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.939" dur="3.871">out there giving the speech they want</text>
  <text start="365.56" dur="5.49">him to give just like he fired the</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="6.06">Tomahawk missiles into Syria and they</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="5.639">hit the base but he warned Russia Syria</text>
  <text start="373.87" dur="5.849">they removed the planes they moved two</text>
  <text start="376.689" dur="4.5">personnel and really the base Billy</text>
  <text start="379.719" dur="3.151">didn&amp;#39;t sustain that much damage they</text>
  <text start="381.189" dur="3.57">were flying planes out of there an hour</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="4.259">later and of course what happened was</text>
  <text start="384.759" dur="3.84">the corporate media was like oh wow</text>
  <text start="387.129" dur="3.331">now Trump is the president he&amp;#39;s our</text>
  <text start="388.599" dur="3.961">president and we&amp;#39;re hoping that he</text>
  <text start="390.46" dur="4.079">invades Syria now well that really</text>
  <text start="392.56" dur="4.71">didn&amp;#39;t happen but he got the deep state</text>
  <text start="394.539" dur="5.791">on his side for a little period of time</text>
  <text start="397.27" dur="5.34">then the North Korea came up and again</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="6.059">the information was that the US has</text>
  <text start="402.61" dur="4.709">Ronald Reagan the USS Carl Vinson the</text>
  <text start="406.389" dur="4.89">USS Nimitz</text>
  <text start="407.319" dur="6.331">they were all going towards North Korea</text>
  <text start="411.279" dur="4.741">and then it turned out that none of them</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="5.16">were going to North Korea and things</text>
  <text start="416.02" dur="5.22">started to break down so he is out in</text>
  <text start="418.81" dur="5.55">Saudi Arabia he visited Israel he</text>
  <text start="421.24" dur="5.599">visited Brussels with NATO met the Pope</text>
  <text start="424.36" dur="6.809">and they&amp;#39;re taught he was talking about</text>
  <text start="426.839" dur="6.19">extremism terrorism but behind the</text>
  <text start="431.169" dur="3.481">scenes to all of this and we need to</text>
  <text start="433.029" dur="4.11">understand what is happening here the</text>
  <text start="434.65" dur="4.919">system is breaking down and we mentioned</text>
  <text start="437.139" dur="4.89">that there was a representative that he</text>
  <text start="439.569" dur="5.34">sent to the beltram road system he spoke</text>
  <text start="442.029" dur="4.081">to shishun ping in mar-a-lago because he</text>
  <text start="444.909" dur="2.82">didn&amp;#39;t want to speak to him in the White</text>
  <text start="446.11" dur="2.729">House there were too many leaks and we</text>
  <text start="447.729" dur="3.66">know the White House is completely</text>
  <text start="448.839" dur="4.581">bugged and we can see that things are in</text>
  <text start="451.389" dur="4.251">motion behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="453.42" dur="7.44">we need to remember back in time</text>
  <text start="455.64" dur="8.13">remember when in 1970 1971 72 when</text>
  <text start="460.86" dur="5.13">Kissinger was in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="5.7">setting up the deals behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="465.99" dur="5.25">setting up the petrodollar that with</text>
  <text start="469.47" dur="4.59">Saudi Arabia other Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="471.24" dur="5.31">countries where the United States would</text>
  <text start="474.06" dur="4.56">protect them militarily they would use</text>
  <text start="476.55" dur="3.57">the dollar on the oil this was all</text>
  <text start="478.62" dur="2.85">happening behind the scenes while the</text>
  <text start="480.12" dur="4.53">corporate media was telling us there was</text>
  <text start="481.47" dur="4.02">a shortage of oil Trump now is doing the</text>
  <text start="484.65" dur="2.79">opposite</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="4.89">he knows the petro dollar system is</text>
  <text start="487.44" dur="5.31">coming to an end he understands that</text>
  <text start="490.38" dur="5.1">deals has to be made within the Middle</text>
  <text start="492.75" dur="5.85">East he understands that we need to have</text>
  <text start="495.48" dur="6.11">trade and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="498.6" dur="5.91">that trumps outreach to the Middle East</text>
  <text start="501.59" dur="6.58">cannot be divorced from China&amp;#39;s own</text>
  <text start="504.51" dur="5.76">plans for the Middle East China will now</text>
  <text start="508.17" dur="4.62">have to be involved now the belt and</text>
  <text start="510.27" dur="4.26">road system well the Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="512.79" dur="4.53">countries they will be getting involved</text>
  <text start="514.53" dur="4.949">in this because they will need to</text>
  <text start="517.32" dur="5.67">because their systems will no longer</text>
  <text start="519.479" dur="5.491">depend and actually live on the</text>
  <text start="522.99" dur="5.7">petrodollar system because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.97" dur="6.99">disappearing so we can see this part of</text>
  <text start="528.69" dur="6.21">the plan where they&amp;#39;re bringing in the</text>
  <text start="531.96" dur="7.56">Arab states the Middle East into this</text>
  <text start="534.9" dur="8.04">system and Beijing well they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="539.52" dur="5.85">to set up and have and integrate China</text>
  <text start="542.94" dur="5.61">into East and West Asia</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="5.25">now we can see that the deep state</text>
  <text start="548.55" dur="4.35">doesn&amp;#39;t want this to happen they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="550.62" dur="4.74">want any of this and those that are</text>
  <text start="552.9" dur="5.58">invited are India they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="555.36" dur="7.37">other nations like Saudi Arabia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.48" dur="8.94">looking at nations like Libya Iraq Syria</text>
  <text start="562.73" dur="10.39">Iran - all join in on this belt in road</text>
  <text start="567.42" dur="7.68">system for open free trade now this has</text>
  <text start="573.12" dur="4.65">to be done at this point because</text>
  <text start="575.1" dur="4.68">remember trade is very important as the</text>
  <text start="577.77" dur="5.1">petrodollar system completely</text>
  <text start="579.78" dur="4.92">disintegrates the Middle Eastern nations</text>
  <text start="582.87" dur="3.42">they will not be able to survive and</text>
  <text start="584.7" dur="2.56">when he&amp;#39;s out there talking about</text>
  <text start="586.29" dur="3.13">getting rid of</text>
  <text start="587.26" dur="4.23">tourism you know he really means it he</text>
  <text start="589.42" dur="3.51">needs the terrorists and that is the</text>
  <text start="591.49" dur="3.84">deep state that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="592.93" dur="4.16">talking about to come to an end now</text>
  <text start="595.33" dur="4.2">what&amp;#39;s going to happen here is that</text>
  <text start="597.09" dur="5.38">everything is going to shift from the</text>
  <text start="599.53" dur="4.71">west to the east this is the plan and</text>
  <text start="602.47" dur="3.69">again the deep state is trying to put a</text>
  <text start="604.24" dur="2.79">stop to all of this they don&amp;#39;t want any</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="2.88">of this to happen</text>
  <text start="607.03" dur="4.41">they wanted their TPP they wanted all</text>
  <text start="609.04" dur="4.74">this stuff and we need to remember these</text>
  <text start="611.44" dur="5.04">deep state the central bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="613.78" dur="5.46">wanted the United States to be a third</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="5.13">world country because the globalist view</text>
  <text start="619.24" dur="4.65">was that you needed to bring all the</text>
  <text start="621.61" dur="4.98">countries down to a certain level where</text>
  <text start="623.89" dur="4.41">everyone received the same pay so those</text>
  <text start="626.59" dur="3.96">individuals could go anywhere in the</text>
  <text start="628.3" dur="3.96">world and work in all different</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="4.92">countries because it would be one</text>
  <text start="632.26" dur="5.76">currency one pay and the way of life</text>
  <text start="635.47" dur="4.83">would be the same everywhere and it</text>
  <text start="638.02" dur="6.44">wouldn&amp;#39;t be this high living standard of</text>
  <text start="640.3" dur="6.93">life only the top echelon like the 1%</text>
  <text start="644.46" dur="4.15">would be in that area like we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="647.23" dur="3.15">almost today this is what they were</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="3.69">trying to do and they knew the United</text>
  <text start="650.38" dur="2.46">States would have to be brought down to</text>
  <text start="652.3" dur="5.27">that level</text>
  <text start="652.84" dur="7.7">a nationalist / globalist would contain</text>

  <text start="660.54" dur="8.35">the way of life the way it is today plus</text>
  <text start="665.2" dur="7.13">have trade with countries around the</text>
  <text start="668.89" dur="7.08">world by joining a free trade system</text>
  <text start="672.33" dur="6.97">because we will not have the US dollar</text>
  <text start="675.97" dur="4.77">as a reserve currency where countries</text>
  <text start="679.3" dur="3.21">take on the dollar they keep it in</text>
  <text start="680.74" dur="3.57">reserves and they send the products back</text>
  <text start="682.51" dur="3.33">to the United States because they have</text>
  <text start="684.31" dur="3.84">to keep those dollars and reserves to</text>
  <text start="685.84" dur="4.38">pay for the oil that system is coming to</text>
  <text start="688.15" dur="4.29">an end this is why he needs to be both</text>
  <text start="690.22" dur="4.65">because we need to be part of that trade</text>
  <text start="692.44" dur="6.53">system because we will no longer be able</text>
  <text start="694.87" dur="6.24">to use the dollar as a reserve currency</text>
  <text start="698.97" dur="4.12">we won&amp;#39;t be able to use the dollar as</text>
  <text start="701.11" dur="4.29">putting pressure on all these countries</text>
  <text start="703.09" dur="3.69">to make them do what we want countries</text>
  <text start="705.4" dur="3.33">will no longer have to hold the dollar</text>
  <text start="706.78" dur="3.78">in reserve and as they receive these</text>
  <text start="708.73" dur="4.02">dollars they have to send products back</text>
  <text start="710.56" dur="6.24">to the United States this will no longer</text>
  <text start="712.75" dur="6.75">be in place and this is why at this</text>
  <text start="716.8" dur="4.35">point these deals need to be made just</text>
  <text start="719.5" dur="4.2">like when we were coming off the</text>
  <text start="721.15" dur="4.35">old Standard and Kissinger was in the</text>
  <text start="723.7" dur="3.99">Middle East making deals behind the</text>
  <text start="725.5" dur="5.1">scenes the same thing is happening right</text>
  <text start="727.69" dur="4.68">now but the opposite way that is what is</text>
  <text start="730.6" dur="4.5">happening now Trump is heading out to</text>
  <text start="732.37" dur="5.52">the g7 summit this does not include</text>
  <text start="735.1" dur="6.63">China or Russia and the main topics for</text>
  <text start="737.89" dur="6.66">this g7 summit is terrorism North Korea</text>
  <text start="741.73" dur="4.86">and Trump&amp;#39;s stance on climate change now</text>
  <text start="744.55" dur="4.83">the g7 leaders they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="746.59" dur="4.89">convince him that yes the United States</text>
  <text start="749.38" dur="5.01">needs to be part of the Paris agreement</text>
  <text start="751.48" dur="4.86">and Trump did promise that the United</text>
  <text start="754.39" dur="3.75">States will not be joining this we will</text>
  <text start="756.34" dur="4.95">have to wait to see what he does</text>
  <text start="758.14" dur="4.5">will they influence him in joining the</text>
  <text start="761.29" dur="3.96">climate change now we have to remember</text>
  <text start="762.64" dur="5.28">all of these countries in the g7 summit</text>
  <text start="765.25" dur="4.23">the deep state a lot of these countries</text>
  <text start="767.92" dur="4.86">are part of the deep state they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="769.48" dur="4.71">to try to influence him and push him in</text>
  <text start="772.78" dur="4.14">the direction of the United States</text>
  <text start="774.19" dur="5.79">staying with the Paris agreement this is</text>
  <text start="776.92" dur="4.74">a real test for Trump at this point how</text>
  <text start="779.98" dur="4.98">strong is he</text>
  <text start="781.66" dur="4.95">how strong are those individuals trying</text>
  <text start="784.96" dur="4.44">to get rid of the deep state because</text>
  <text start="786.61" dur="5.19">this is what it really comes down to and</text>
  <text start="789.4" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;ll have to see what he does at this</text>
  <text start="791.8" dur="4.44">point because he might fold and all</text>
  <text start="794.2" dur="4.05">these plans might go down the toilet</text>
  <text start="796.24" dur="3.33">because they still have a lot of</text>
  <text start="798.25" dur="3.27">influence remember the deep States been</text>
  <text start="799.57" dur="3.99">around for a very long time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="801.52" dur="4.29">entrenched in government that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="803.56" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s that deep state there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="805.81" dur="4.68">individuals trying to get rid of Trump</text>
  <text start="808.66" dur="4.17">at this point and we can see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="810.49" dur="4.95">lot of pressure to remove him because</text>
  <text start="812.83" dur="5.67">they don&amp;#39;t want all of this stuff undone</text>
  <text start="815.44" dur="4.74">and this is why we see the attack on</text>
  <text start="818.5" dur="5.58">Trump and it this is why we see it</text>
  <text start="820.18" dur="5.67">coming out at him so hard and fast now</text>
  <text start="824.08" dur="4.32">out in the Philippines we understand</text>
  <text start="825.85" dur="5.75">that you dirty he declared martial law</text>
  <text start="828.4" dur="5.85">on an island within the Philippines and</text>
  <text start="831.6" dur="5.68">this is due to the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="834.25" dur="4.95">now Duterte claims and he&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="837.28" dur="4.2">with this information that he&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="839.2" dur="6.15">targeted for an assassination by the CIA</text>
  <text start="841.48" dur="6.15">now we know they want the Philippines to</text>
  <text start="845.35" dur="5.13">encircle China this was the plan from</text>
  <text start="847.63" dur="5.22">the beginning and Duterte well he</text>
  <text start="850.48" dur="4.47">doesn&amp;#39;t want to work with the United</text>
  <text start="852.85" dur="4.47">States he&amp;#39;s working with China right now</text>
  <text start="854.95" dur="6.27">and Russia and he&amp;#39;s out there saying</text>
  <text start="857.32" dur="6.9">that he knows the CIA sent the Islamic</text>
  <text start="861.22" dur="6.63">state to his country to try to remove to</text>
  <text start="864.22" dur="5.43">remove him and to assassinate him which</text>
  <text start="867.85" dur="4.23">is very interesting because now these</text>
  <text start="869.65" dur="6.42">countries are actually calling out the</text>
  <text start="872.08" dur="7.26">CIA and the deep state where they are</text>
  <text start="876.07" dur="5.1">the ones who created the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="879.34" dur="4.14">from the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="881.17" dur="5.04">we even have Russia out there the far</text>
  <text start="883.48" dur="5.85">the Russian Foreign Ministry is accusing</text>
  <text start="886.21" dur="5.06">the United States and NATO of supporting</text>
  <text start="889.33" dur="6">the Islamic state in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="891.27" dur="6.73">basically what they said is that US and</text>
  <text start="895.33" dur="5.28">NATO they are covering up their own</text>
  <text start="898" dur="5.85">support for the terrorists which are the</text>
  <text start="900.61" dur="6.57">Islamic state and what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="903.85" dur="5.61">about is that if you remember the report</text>
  <text start="907.18" dur="4.02">came out that Russia was arming the</text>
  <text start="909.46" dur="3.51">Taliban and the report came out that</text>
  <text start="911.2" dur="3.66">said they were not arming the Taliban</text>
  <text start="912.97" dur="4.53">that was completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="914.86" dur="5.88">but what the Russians are saying right</text>
  <text start="917.5" dur="6.84">now is they have documentation and proof</text>
  <text start="920.74" dur="6.48">that the u.s. is supporting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="924.34" dur="5.79">state in Afghanistan now this is what</text>
  <text start="927.22" dur="4.59">they said the u.s. detained but then</text>
  <text start="930.13" dur="3.98">released the son of the head of the</text>
  <text start="931.81" dur="5.46">terrorist Islamic movement of Uzbekistan</text>
  <text start="934.11" dur="6.16">he is now an Isis commander in</text>
  <text start="937.27" dur="4.77">Afghanistan there was a night landing of</text>
  <text start="940.27" dur="4.92">two helicopters without identification</text>
  <text start="942.04" dur="6.18">in extremist controlled territory in</text>
  <text start="945.19" dur="5.88">this saiad district the helicopters then</text>
  <text start="948.22" dur="4.83">flew back to a NATO base now this is</text>
  <text start="951.07" dur="4.26">where it gets interesting they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="953.05" dur="5.16">that the u.s. resorted to a well known</text>
  <text start="955.33" dur="5.22">trick of manipulating public opinion by</text>
  <text start="958.21" dur="4.43">presenting in the same context reports</text>
  <text start="960.55" dur="5.88">about the appearance of an unidentified</text>
  <text start="962.64" dur="6.34">helicopters in the Kunduz province the</text>
  <text start="966.43" dur="5.22">facts we have at our disposal show that</text>
  <text start="968.98" dur="5.25">the reality is completely different the</text>
  <text start="971.65" dur="5.4">Islamic state commandos who were going</text>
  <text start="974.23" dur="5.7">to buy arms from the Americans were</text>
  <text start="977.05" dur="5.76">caught at the same time with a huge sum</text>
  <text start="979.93" dur="8.08">of money and the US had to explain the</text>
  <text start="982.81" dur="8.02">way of what actually happened and Russia</text>
  <text start="988.01" dur="4.95">tract the helicopters they knew exactly</text>
  <text start="990.83" dur="4.74">was what was going on and they have</text>
  <text start="992.96" dur="5.22">proof that yes the deep state the</text>
  <text start="995.57" dur="5.91">intelligence operative operatives they</text>
  <text start="998.18" dur="7.11">are supporting and funding the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1001.48" dur="6.12">state in Afghanistan now the Italian</text>
  <text start="1005.29" dur="5.49">Prime Minister is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="1007.6" dur="6.06">NATO needs to speak with Russia there</text>
  <text start="1010.78" dur="6.15">needs to be a dialogue it&amp;#39;s enough of</text>
  <text start="1013.66" dur="6">this Russian aggression no one is</text>
  <text start="1016.93" dur="4.77">believing this anymore and we can see</text>
  <text start="1019.66" dur="5.52">right now that whole thing is completely</text>
  <text start="1021.7" dur="6.139">falling apart now out in Syria we see</text>
  <text start="1025.18" dur="5.67">Russia and China they share the same</text>
  <text start="1027.839" dur="5.321">stance on the Syrian crisis they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1030.85" dur="4.229">saying the Istana talks that is the</text>
  <text start="1033.16" dur="4.71">format that needs to be going forward</text>
  <text start="1035.079" dur="5.431">and we can see right now that they are</text>
  <text start="1037.87" dur="4.53">all for a ceasefire they are all for</text>
  <text start="1040.51" dur="3.75">ensuring humanitarian access and</text>
  <text start="1042.4" dur="4.38">creating more favorable conditions for</text>
  <text start="1044.26" dur="5.4">the start of an exclusive intra-syrian</text>
  <text start="1046.78" dur="7.11">dialogue in Geneva and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1049.66" dur="6.9">China Russia Syria they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="1053.89" dur="5.52">have peace the deep state they are still</text>
  <text start="1056.56" dur="5.13">pushing their agenda to either split</text>
  <text start="1059.41" dur="4.41">Syria or to get Assad I think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1061.69" dur="3.6">about to split Syria at this point</text>
  <text start="1063.82" dur="3.75">because they realize there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="1065.29" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re getting into Damascus because we</text>
  <text start="1067.57" dur="4.2">could see at this point that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1069.73" dur="4.08">state they are in retreat they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="1071.77" dur="3.96">ground in northern Syria and the eastern</text>
  <text start="1073.81" dur="4.38">Aleppo province they&amp;#39;re being steadily</text>
  <text start="1075.73" dur="5.01">rolled back by the Syria&amp;#39;s elite Tiger</text>
  <text start="1078.19" dur="4.41">forces in the south the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1080.74" dur="6">suffered a dramatic setback it was</text>
  <text start="1082.6" dur="6.66">forced to concede a whopping 20 2,700</text>
  <text start="1086.74" dur="5.49">square kilometers south of Palmyra in</text>
  <text start="1089.26" dur="5.76">just a few days and we see right now</text>
  <text start="1092.23" dur="5.19">that the Islamic state they have nowhere</text>
  <text start="1095.02" dur="4.2">to go at this point they are pretty much</text>
  <text start="1097.42" dur="4.5">done and the deep state knows this and</text>
  <text start="1099.22" dur="5.13">we see that they are preparing and</text>
  <text start="1101.92" dur="3.84">training paid mercenaries because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1104.35" dur="3.87">really what the Islamic state is all</text>
  <text start="1105.76" dur="4.38">made up of all the terrorist groups are</text>
  <text start="1108.22" dur="4.56">made up of this and they&amp;#39;re preparing</text>
  <text start="1110.14" dur="4.2">and getting ready to do something now</text>
  <text start="1112.78" dur="4.47">when is this going to happen we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1114.34" dur="3.9">know we have reports and this is coming</text>
  <text start="1117.25" dur="2.58">from Mike Stern of it saying that</text>
  <text start="1118.24" dur="3.69">something might happen June 1st and</text>
  <text start="1119.83" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re getting very close to that date</text>
  <text start="1121.93" dur="4.98">patterns have shown us that normally</text>
  <text start="1124.39" dur="5.4">this type of thing happens during the</text>
  <text start="1126.91" dur="4.86">month of August when Congress leaves and</text>
  <text start="1129.79" dur="4.17">they go on vacation and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1131.77" dur="3.66">return until after Labor Day now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1133.96" dur="3.15">going to have to watch the situation</text>
  <text start="1135.43" dur="4.35">very closely because we can see that</text>
  <text start="1137.11" dur="4.2">things are starting to unravel with many</text>
  <text start="1139.78" dur="2.94">different things especially with the</text>
  <text start="1141.31" dur="4.11">Russian collusion the Russian aggression</text>
  <text start="1142.72" dur="5.52">and we see that there is interest in</text>
  <text start="1145.42" dur="6.03">these Seth rich murder and all of this</text>
  <text start="1148.24" dur="5.76">is now starting to fall apart the deep</text>
  <text start="1151.45" dur="6">state is going to only let it get so far</text>
  <text start="1154" dur="6.9">until they pull some type of an event</text>
  <text start="1157.45" dur="5.55">out of their bag of tricks and we can</text>
  <text start="1160.9" dur="6.21">see right now this is where we are</text>
  <text start="1163" dur="7.23">headed now at the same time Trump and</text>
  <text start="1167.11" dur="5.52">his administration those people who are</text>
  <text start="1170.23" dur="4.89">fighting against the deep state they are</text>
  <text start="1172.63" dur="4.38">preparing the United States for a</text>
  <text start="1175.12" dur="4.38">complete reset of the system which means</text>
  <text start="1177.01" dur="3.18">the Fiat system will completely</text>
  <text start="1179.5" dur="5.7">disappear</text>
  <text start="1180.19" dur="7.14">a new system will be started up the US</text>
  <text start="1185.2" dur="4.5">dollar as the reserve currency will no</text>
  <text start="1187.33" dur="4.32">longer exist we will have to go within</text>
  <text start="1189.7" dur="6.06">the United States to support ourselves</text>
  <text start="1191.65" dur="6.24">like looking for oil this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1206.38" dur="5.1">is going to start in 2018 very</text>
  <text start="1208.41" dur="5.53">interesting we also see that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1211.48" dur="4.77">looking at all the different land that</text>
  <text start="1213.94" dur="4.68">was put up for collateral on the debt</text>
  <text start="1216.25" dur="5.4">and seeing what natural resources are</text>
  <text start="1218.62" dur="6.48">there and this is all in preparation for</text>
  <text start="1221.65" dur="4.77">the system coming down and we can see</text>
  <text start="1225.1" dur="3.78">that the central bank well they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1226.42" dur="4.77">the same exact thing but except a little</text>
  <text start="1228.88" dur="5.28">different they&amp;#39;re looking to keep their</text>
  <text start="1231.19" dur="6.33">system going the way it is now it will</text>
  <text start="1234.16" dur="5.04">collapse but what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="1237.52" dur="3.83">they&amp;#39;re going to try to pump it up once</text>
  <text start="1239.2" dur="5.28">again showing that the central bank is</text>
  <text start="1241.35" dur="4.27">saving the system the way it is a lot of</text>

  <text start="1245.62" dur="5.64">the credit is going to freeze up just</text>
  <text start="1247.99" dur="5.01">like with the collapse that Trump is</text>
  <text start="1251.26" dur="3.93">trying to do the whole thing is going to</text>
  <text start="1253" dur="2.46">be the same the only difference is we</text>
  <text start="1255.19" dur="1.68">will</text>
  <text start="1255.46" dur="2.85">we&amp;#39;ll be under the control of the</text>

  <text start="1258.31" dur="5.61">of the system where they create currency</text>
  <text start="1261.49" dur="5.37">with interest attached the new system is</text>
  <text start="1263.92" dur="5.37">going to be with no interest attached</text>
  <text start="1266.86" dur="4.59">where the people actually create their</text>

  <text start="1271.45" dur="4.53">dependent on itself for a certain period</text>
  <text start="1273.91" dur="5.55">of time where we can rebuild</text>
