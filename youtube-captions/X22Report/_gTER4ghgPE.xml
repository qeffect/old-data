  <text start="107.19" dur="4.219">to do something they&amp;#39;ve never done</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="3.781">before and this is all without</text>

  <text start="113.19" dur="5.76">course does manipulation but what we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="151.799" dur="7.351">real human of losses stocks endured less</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="5.61">adversity in 2017 than in any other year</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="6.75">on record going back more than a hundred</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="6.48">years this is unbelievable and the</text>
  <text start="165.9" dur="4.47">reason for this is because it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="167.88" dur="6">all it&amp;#39;s all manipulated it&amp;#39;s to make</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="6.69">you think that this is the best thing</text>
  <text start="173.88" dur="5.94">since sliced bread this is what they do</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="5.16">look what the housing market did back</text>
  <text start="179.82" dur="5.129">prior to 2008 it could just continually</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="4.62">moved up look at the market every single</text>
  <text start="184.949" dur="2.311">time we had some type of recession or</text>
  <text start="186.84" dur="2.22">depression</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="4.44">where it continually moved up and it</text>
  <text start="189.06" dur="4.709">looked fantastic I mean back in the 70s</text>
  <text start="191.7" dur="4.05">the market hit a thousand they they</text>
  <text start="193.769" dur="2.911">thought this was unbelievable that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.75" dur="2.64">never gonna end</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="3.66">and then everything came to a crashing a</text>
  <text start="198.39" dur="4.739">crashing end and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="7.229">to see right now now we understand that</text>
  <text start="203.129" dur="6.301">the US will not allow an audit of the</text>
  <text start="207.569" dur="4.741">gold reserves now we know minuchin was</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="4.8">in there he held up one gold bar letting</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="3.69">everyone know that the gold is there but</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="4.259">of course we didn&amp;#39;t see the rest of the</text>
  <text start="216" dur="5.609">golden of the auditors didn&amp;#39;t even go</text>
  <text start="218.489" dur="5.821">into all the different areas where the</text>
  <text start="221.609" dur="6.63">gold were to check the bars of gold now</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="6.45">there is another theory coming out from</text>
  <text start="228.239" dur="7.231">bullion star precious metals expert</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="8.97">Ronan Manley and he saying that yes the</text>
  <text start="235.47" dur="6.629">US does have gold it&amp;#39;s not missing it is</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="3.75">there because the u.s. claims that are</text>
  <text start="242.099" dur="3.601">holding about eight thousand one hundred</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="5.31">and thirty three tons of physical gold</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="7.2">in its reserves he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="7.559">gold well the reason why they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="252.9" dur="6.72">allow an audit it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s low</text>
  <text start="256.349" dur="6.451">purity which means it might have been</text>
  <text start="259.62" dur="5.01">replaced refined and whatever and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.8" dur="5.01">sitting there and it doesn&amp;#39;t pass the</text>
  <text start="264.63" dur="5.58">smell test now it might be there for</text>
  <text start="267.81" dur="4.889">viewing but if anyone went ahead and</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="4.47">actually audited and took you know</text>
  <text start="272.699" dur="4.291">taking a look at the gold bars drill</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="4.5">through it to see what it&amp;#39;s really what</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="5.94">it really is and check the purity of it</text>
  <text start="279.18" dur="5.82">well that would be a problem and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="4.769">saying that this is most likely the</text>
  <text start="285" dur="5.25">story and this is the problem this is</text>
  <text start="287.699" dur="6.241">why they won&amp;#39;t let auditors into the</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="4.83">area where the gold is and we see</text>
  <text start="293.94" dur="2.49">there&amp;#39;s many different theories that are</text>
  <text start="295.08" dur="3.3">out there many people say the gold is</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="4.709">completely gone I think the goal that</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="4.65">was there is completely gone and over</text>
  <text start="301.139" dur="3.571">time they replaced it with this crap</text>
  <text start="303.03" dur="6.59">type of gold where it&amp;#39;s very very low</text>
  <text start="304.71" dur="7.59">purity and it doesn&amp;#39;t meet the trade</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="4.15">specifications where countries would</text>
  <text start="312.3" dur="3.81">take it back and they&amp;#39;d say yes this is</text>
  <text start="313.77" dur="4.32">our gold and I think a lot of them have</text>
  <text start="316.11" dur="4.109">been swapped out over the many over the</text>
  <text start="318.09" dur="2.639">years and replaced with this and maybe</text>
  <text start="320.219" dur="3.09">it may be</text>
  <text start="320.729" dur="4.53">a lot of it is even fake but we need to</text>
  <text start="323.309" dur="3.48">understand is that other countries</text>
  <text start="325.259" dur="3.99">around the world</text>
  <text start="326.789" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;ve been ramping up their gold</text>
  <text start="329.249" dur="5.67">purchases and this is for a specific</text>
  <text start="331.529" dur="6.271">reason countries don&amp;#39;t do this just just</text>
  <text start="334.919" dur="5.37">to do it think about your family if</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="5.1">you&amp;#39;re gonna buy or trade your paper</text>
  <text start="340.289" dur="5.19">currency in for fiscal gold or silver</text>
  <text start="342.9" dur="3.78">and you&amp;#39;re planning to hold it not trade</text>
  <text start="345.479" dur="3.12">it and try to make a profit but just</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="4.769">hold it to protect your wealth you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.599" dur="5.1">doing it for a specific reason now the</text>
  <text start="351.449" dur="4.83">gold prices the silver prices they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.699" dur="5.64">very very low at this point and we</text>
  <text start="356.279" dur="4.95">understand that the transition has been</text>
  <text start="359.339" dur="3.931">taking place for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="361.229" dur="5.131">what I mean by this I don&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="363.27" dur="5.369">we&amp;#39;re seeing the entire economy move</text>
  <text start="366.36" dur="4.709">over to the east just yet we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="368.639" dur="4.89">everything put into place first and this</text>
  <text start="371.069" dur="4.56">takes time it doesn&amp;#39;t happen overnight</text>
  <text start="373.529" dur="4.11">and they do it very slowly very</text>
  <text start="375.629" dur="3.18">methodically to make sure that everyone</text>
  <text start="377.639" dur="3.12">doesn&amp;#39;t realize that this is really</text>
  <text start="378.809" dur="3.51">happening and we see that the BRIC</text>
  <text start="380.759" dur="3.93">nations they want to start this gold</text>
  <text start="382.319" dur="4.981">trade system and we see nations like</text>
  <text start="384.689" dur="4.32">China we see nations like Russia and</text>
  <text start="387.3" dur="3.389">many other nations</text>
  <text start="389.009" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="390.689" dur="5.581">but what a lot of people don&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="392.399" dur="8.94">is that there are many other countries</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="8.069">like Kazakhstan now this country is in a</text>
  <text start="401.339" dur="6.75">geographical position and it has natural</text>
  <text start="404.339" dur="6.931">resources like gold rare earths and many</text>
  <text start="408.089" dur="5.85">other elements within its borders and we</text>
  <text start="411.27" dur="5.429">understand that Russia China this is</text>
  <text start="413.939" dur="4.831">part of the their system and they</text>
  <text start="416.699" dur="5.49">understand that they have a lot what</text>
  <text start="418.77" dur="4.139">they need and when you look at China and</text>
  <text start="422.189" dur="3.21">Russia</text>
  <text start="422.909" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;ve been acquiring quite a bit of</text>
  <text start="425.399" dur="5">gold and recently as we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="428.309" dur="5.94">gonna be starting this gold trade system</text>
  <text start="430.399" dur="6.91">now if you look at Russia the Central</text>
  <text start="434.249" dur="6.66">Bank of Russia they added 900 thousand</text>
  <text start="437.309" dur="6.991">ounces 27.9 nine tons of gold to their</text>
  <text start="440.909" dur="8.82">reserves raising the capital raising the</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="8.159">total of gold to 1820 8.88 tons or 58.8</text>
  <text start="449.729" dur="4.691">million ounces in October of 2017</text>
  <text start="452.459" dur="5.051">they added 700</text>
  <text start="454.42" dur="6.12">announces in September of 2017</text>
  <text start="457.51" dur="5.19">they added 1.1 million ounces of gold</text>
  <text start="460.54" dur="3.54">now China has been doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="462.7" dur="3.69">they keep there&amp;#39;s a little bit more</text>
  <text start="464.08" dur="3.87">hidden and they are doing this on</text>
  <text start="466.39" dur="3.27">purpose because eventually what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="467.95" dur="6">to happen and we discussed this before</text>
  <text start="469.66" dur="6.9">is their system on a high level the</text>
  <text start="473.95" dur="4.41">petrol you want or the sto or whatever</text>
  <text start="476.56" dur="4.56">they come out with it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="8.43">matter what they call it it will it will</text>
  <text start="481.12" dur="7.74">be backed by gold why because this will</text>
  <text start="486.79" dur="4.62">allow the world to see that this is a</text>
  <text start="488.86" dur="5.07">stable system this is what the central</text>
  <text start="491.41" dur="6.24">banks likes to do in the beginning they</text>
  <text start="493.93" dur="6.3">present a system that is stable that</text>
  <text start="497.65" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s backed by something they make</text>
  <text start="500.23" dur="3.51">people believe in it that this is the</text>
  <text start="502.27" dur="3.75">new system this is where we should be</text>
  <text start="503.74" dur="5.34">going we shouldn&amp;#39;t be looking at the old</text>
  <text start="506.02" dur="5.34">system where has a lot of debt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.08" dur="3.81">backed by absolutely nothing and of</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="3.39">course they just don&amp;#39;t do this they need</text>
  <text start="512.89" dur="4.86">a summon event they need some type of an</text>
  <text start="514.75" dur="5.52">event to distract everyone to say listen</text>
  <text start="517.75" dur="4.44">we can&amp;#39;t go back to the old system we</text>
  <text start="520.27" dur="4.59">need to start a new system because of</text>
  <text start="522.19" dur="4.59">what has happened and we need to go to a</text>
  <text start="524.86" dur="3.63">place where there&amp;#39;s manufacturing we</text>
  <text start="526.78" dur="4.17">need to go to a place where everything</text>
  <text start="528.49" dur="5.52">was in place and this is going to be</text>
  <text start="530.95" dur="5.33">China and Russia now on a high level the</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="5.58">countries are going to be backed by gold</text>
  <text start="536.28" dur="7.81">trade before between countries are going</text>
  <text start="539.59" dur="6.51">to be backed by gold the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="544.09" dur="5.97">gonna be using most likely some type of</text>
  <text start="546.1" dur="6.33">cashless digital system most likely</text>
  <text start="550.06" dur="5.73">crypto currencies this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="6.03">gonna try to do they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="555.79" dur="4.05">convince the world that this is where</text>
  <text start="558.46" dur="5.16">you need to move and the central banks</text>
  <text start="559.84" dur="6.27">need to manage this and we see right now</text>
  <text start="563.62" dur="5.04">that we are getting ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="566.11" dur="4.77">for this transition everything is almost</text>
  <text start="568.66" dur="5.4">in place it&amp;#39;s very very close right now</text>
  <text start="570.88" dur="5.49">where everything they need is in place</text>
  <text start="574.06" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;ve done their testing they have the</text>
  <text start="576.37" dur="3.92">petro yuyuan which they&amp;#39;re pushing out</text>
  <text start="578.26" dur="5.19">to the pub to two countries right now</text>
  <text start="580.29" dur="6.61">countries are climbing aboard using the</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="4.41">petrol yuan we see that China and Russia</text>
  <text start="586.9" dur="4.8">there</text>
  <text start="587.86" dur="5.76">be taking away the trade the gold trade</text>
  <text start="591.7" dur="3.84">system away from the West they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="593.62" dur="4.95">be developing it and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="595.54" dur="5.16">revalue the gold price this is where</text>
  <text start="598.57" dur="4.62">their gold holdings come into effect</text>
  <text start="600.7" dur="4.379">because once you reevaluate and say okay</text>
  <text start="603.19" dur="3.93">look what&amp;#39;s happening they can even say</text>
  <text start="605.079" dur="4.171">look they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating it in the</text>
  <text start="607.12" dur="5.1">West and this is the real gold price</text>
  <text start="609.25" dur="4.44">right now but on a high level this is</text>
  <text start="612.22" dur="4.47">why they&amp;#39;re doing this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="613.69" dur="4.889">been ramping up on gold low level they</text>
  <text start="616.69" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t care that much because they know</text>
  <text start="618.579" dur="4.291">they&amp;#39;re gonna be able to convince</text>
  <text start="619.99" dur="4.529">governments once they take control while</text>
  <text start="622.87" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re hoping to convince governments</text>
  <text start="624.519" dur="4.621">to pass laws that&amp;#39;s all they need all</text>
  <text start="626.95" dur="5.19">they need is to have governments around</text>
  <text start="629.14" dur="6.509">the world Pat to pass these laws so they</text>
  <text start="632.14" dur="5.34">can push their agenda now this is the</text>
  <text start="635.649" dur="3.961">reason why we need to wake a lot of</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="3.96">people up this is why we need to spread</text>
  <text start="639.61" dur="3.69">the word this is why we need to let</text>
  <text start="641.44" dur="3.389">everyone know what is going on this is</text>
  <text start="643.3" dur="4.89">why we need to let everyone know that</text>
  <text start="644.829" dur="6.391">this can&amp;#39;t happen because if they have</text>
  <text start="648.19" dur="5.25">the ability and they take control of the</text>
  <text start="651.22" dur="5.489">crypto market and they bring us into a</text>
  <text start="653.44" dur="6.93">cashless society and they monitor it</text>
  <text start="656.709" dur="5.851">it&amp;#39;s not going to be this decentralized</text>
  <text start="660.37" dur="4.11">system it&amp;#39;s going to be a centralized</text>
  <text start="662.56" dur="5.88">system and they will use the blockchain</text>
  <text start="664.48" dur="6.45">to manage everything and we can see</text>
  <text start="668.44" dur="4.29">right now that if the people truly want</text>
  <text start="670.93" dur="4.32">a currency that has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="672.73" dur="5.25">the central bank we need to stand up and</text>
  <text start="675.25" dur="7.14">say listen we need a decentralized</text>
  <text start="677.98" dur="6.12">people run system now right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="682.39" dur="3.03">like the Wild West they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="684.1" dur="3.9">take control that they never took</text>
  <text start="685.42" dur="4.56">control of the internet hopefully they</text>
  <text start="688" dur="5.25">won&amp;#39;t be able to take control of the</text>
  <text start="689.98" dur="4.89">blockchain system but again this is a</text>
  <text start="693.25" dur="4.019">little different because they&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="694.87" dur="4.079">their lesson from the internet they</text>
  <text start="697.269" dur="3.901">thought the internet was there not a big</text>
  <text start="698.949" dur="3.841">deal let them do whatever they want who</text>
  <text start="701.17" dur="2.039">cares it&amp;#39;s not going to amount to</text>
  <text start="702.79" dur="4.2">anything</text>
  <text start="703.209" dur="6.931">we control the major media stations out</text>
  <text start="706.99" dur="7.17">there and we can pump in any news we</text>
  <text start="710.14" dur="5.88">want and it makes no difference well it</text>
  <text start="714.16" dur="3.989">did make a difference and they learned</text>
  <text start="716.02" dur="4.17">their lesson and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="718.149" dur="3.241">trying to get a jump on this very very</text>
  <text start="720.19" dur="2.31">early</text>
  <text start="721.39" dur="3.18">this is why we see all these things</text>
  <text start="722.5" dur="3.93">happening right now and let me just say</text>
  <text start="724.57" dur="5.19">the cryptocurrency system the blockchain</text>
  <text start="726.43" dur="5.43">system is a fantastic system it depends</text>
  <text start="729.76" dur="3.9">who runs it it depends if it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="731.86" dur="4.65">people running it or if it&amp;#39;s a central</text>
  <text start="733.66" dur="4.05">bank running it gold and silver having a</text>
  <text start="736.51" dur="3.84">currency backed by gold and silver is</text>
  <text start="737.71" dur="6.09">fantastic as long as the central bankers</text>
  <text start="740.35" dur="6.69">aren&amp;#39;t controlling the financial system</text>
  <text start="743.8" dur="4.26">if they&amp;#39;re in control gold and silver is</text>
  <text start="747.04" dur="4.5">meaningless</text>
  <text start="748.06" dur="6">the Kryptos are meaningless and this is</text>
  <text start="751.54" dur="4.68">what we need to fight that is our true</text>
  <text start="754.06" dur="4.08">enemy because remember the central</text>
  <text start="756.22" dur="2.39">bank&amp;#39;s if they have control of all of</text>
  <text start="758.14" dur="3.66">this</text>
  <text start="758.61" dur="5.62">they control countries if they can come</text>
  <text start="761.8" dur="5.1">if they can control countries they can</text>
  <text start="764.23" dur="5.88">control what countries do because they</text>
  <text start="766.9" dur="4.56">put them into debt they can control the</text>
  <text start="770.11" dur="4.29">people they can keep them in line</text>
  <text start="771.46" dur="5.88">because then your slave to that debt and</text>
  <text start="774.4" dur="4.98">we see right now this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="777.34" dur="4.08">fighting against we shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="779.38" dur="3.5">fighting amongst each other we shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="781.42" dur="3.93">be doing any of that we should be</text>
  <text start="782.88" dur="5.17">looking at the financial system saying</text>
  <text start="785.35" dur="4.56">that we need to take this back and this</text>
  <text start="788.05" dur="4.17">is where they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="789.91" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda to take</text>
  <text start="792.22" dur="4.5">control of the entire financial system</text>
  <text start="794.86" dur="3.72">and if they get controlled the crypto</text>
  <text start="796.72" dur="6.57">market and they have government&amp;#39;s passed</text>
  <text start="798.58" dur="7.02">laws guess what they control a world</text>
  <text start="803.29" dur="4.17">currency they might split it up into two</text>
  <text start="805.6" dur="3.57">or three or four or five or six but</text>
  <text start="807.46" dur="4.2">eventually what they can do is merge</text>
  <text start="809.17" dur="4.44">them into one very easily on the</text>
  <text start="811.66" dur="6.24">blockchain it won&amp;#39;t be that difficult</text>
  <text start="813.61" dur="8.37">and this is what we need to do we need</text>
  <text start="817.9" dur="6.63">to stop them at every turn and we can</text>
  <text start="821.98" dur="6">see right now that the transition has</text>
  <text start="824.53" dur="6.39">been taken place for a very long time</text>
  <text start="827.98" dur="5.58">everything has been replicated out in</text>
  <text start="830.92" dur="5.07">the East they&amp;#39;re completing it right now</text>
  <text start="833.56" dur="5.61">which means the next phase of all this</text>
  <text start="835.99" dur="5.97">is to start to dismantle what has</text>
  <text start="839.17" dur="5.46">happened here in the West and bring</text>
  <text start="841.96" dur="4.56">online all the systems out in the East</text>
  <text start="844.63" dur="3.93">and they will do this very slowly it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="846.52" dur="3.83">not going to happen the next day but</text>
  <text start="848.56" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re gonna bring them all online and</text>
  <text start="850.35" dur="4.39">they&amp;#39;re gonna start making this shift</text>
  <text start="852.55" dur="2.75">and we&amp;#39;re gonna see once they have</text>
  <text start="854.74" dur="1.969">everything</text>
  <text start="855.3" dur="5.219">been running and everything running at</text>
  <text start="856.709" dur="6.181">the same time as the West guess what all</text>
  <text start="860.519" dur="4.651">they have to do is throw the switch and</text>
  <text start="862.89" dur="5.28">what I mean by that is have something to</text>
  <text start="865.17" dur="4.89">distract everyone of why we need to go</text>
  <text start="868.17" dur="3.81">to that new system so you need to be</text>
  <text start="870.06" dur="3.209">ready and prepared because no matter</text>
  <text start="871.98" dur="5.66">what we&amp;#39;re looking at here the</text>
  <text start="873.269" dur="8.491">transition is happening it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="877.64" dur="5.439">there and maybe the people will control</text>
  <text start="881.76" dur="3.9">it maybe the central banks will control</text>
  <text start="883.079" dur="3.721">but no matter what everything is about</text>
  <text start="885.66" dur="2.76">to change</text>
