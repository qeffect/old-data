  <text start="88.229" dur="5.761">there&amp;#39;s this entire plan that is moving</text>
  <text start="92.13" dur="4.669">forward now we don&amp;#39;t know the entire</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="5.43">plan because if we knew the entire plan</text>
  <text start="96.799" dur="5.35">those who oppose the plan would also</text>
  <text start="99.42" dur="5.25">know it this is why we don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="102.149" dur="5.76">entire scope of the plan and all the</text>
  <text start="104.67" dur="5.96">details about the plan and this is why Q</text>

  <text start="123.42" dur="2.879">the people and what moves and</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="3.99">countermoves</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="4.821">they&amp;#39;re going to use but one thing is</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="3.54">for sure and one thing that we do know</text>
  <text start="131.12" dur="4.36">because we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="133.079" dur="6.091">been following it is that this economy</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="6.96">is based on an illusion and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="6.74">watching this illusion over many years</text>
  <text start="142.44" dur="5.31">and we can see with this illusion</text>
  <text start="145.91" dur="6.52">eventually there&amp;#39;s going to come a point</text>
  <text start="147.75" dur="7.53">in time when people are going to have to</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="6.33">be prepared it might not be right now in</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="5.76">this very moment but when things start</text>
  <text start="158.76" dur="4.89">to fall apart when things start to</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="3.64">really deteriorate when we start the</text>
  <text start="163.65" dur="4.449">transit</text>
  <text start="164.68" dur="6.19">people are going to start to realize ooh</text>
  <text start="168.099" dur="5.051">maybe I should have been prepared and it</text>
  <text start="170.87" dur="5.52">reminds me of people who have been</text>
  <text start="173.15" dur="4.86">through storms where they say now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.39" dur="4.319">not gonna be that bad I&amp;#39;m not gonna get</text>
  <text start="178.01" dur="4.38">batteries I&amp;#39;m not gonna get food I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="180.709" dur="3.241">gonna get extra water because most</text>
  <text start="182.39" dur="3.66">likely it&amp;#39;s gonna be absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="3.9">and then all of a sudden the storm hits</text>
  <text start="186.05" dur="5.13">and they find out that they&amp;#39;re without</text>
  <text start="187.85" dur="8.219">electric stores have no food they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="191.18" dur="6.66">find fuel and there&amp;#39;s no water and this</text>
  <text start="196.069" dur="3.361">could be through a hurricane this could</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="3.78">be through a winter storm this could be</text>
  <text start="199.43" dur="4.77">through anything and you know what they</text>
  <text start="201.62" dur="6.089">wished at that time they wished they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="204.2" dur="5.84">prepared and we are seeing the first</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="5.971">indicators that Americans are not</text>
  <text start="210.04" dur="5.65">prepared for what is coming and it could</text>
  <text start="213.68" dur="5.7">be anything that&amp;#39;s coming but if there</text>
  <text start="215.69" dur="5.91">is an economic problem this is something</text>
  <text start="219.38" dur="4.71">you really need to be prepared for now</text>
  <text start="221.6" dur="4.53">when we look at the economy we look at</text>
  <text start="224.09" dur="5.179">all these statistics and we look at all</text>
  <text start="226.13" dur="6.51">these numbers we know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="229.269" dur="5.791">manipulated we know they&amp;#39;re there for a</text>
  <text start="232.64" dur="6.15">purpose there&amp;#39;s a reason for them and</text>
  <text start="235.06" dur="5.98">Trump is using them to go after the</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="3.72">central banks in the deep state because</text>
  <text start="241.04" dur="3.69">he wants to control the narrative that</text>
  <text start="242.51" dur="3.87">was the whole point of all of this is to</text>
  <text start="244.73" dur="3.72">use their weapon against them to control</text>
  <text start="246.38" dur="3.6">the narrative now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="248.45" dur="3.06">interesting is when we look at initial</text>
  <text start="249.98" dur="4.44">jobless claims I mean they have they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="251.51" dur="5.909">the lowest that we&amp;#39;ve ever seen since</text>
  <text start="254.42" dur="5.76">1969 I mean think about that for a</text>
  <text start="257.419" dur="6.87">second we have such low employment which</text>
  <text start="260.18" dur="7.23">doesn&amp;#39;t mean we have good jobs if these</text>
  <text start="264.289" dur="4.711">numbers are real well a lot of people</text>
  <text start="267.41" dur="3.03">have part-time jobs but we know that</text>
  <text start="269" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;re manipulated and we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.44" dur="4.16">much lower than they really are but</text>
  <text start="271.82" dur="5.4">every time the initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="274.6" dur="7.48">reach a certain point where they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="277.22" dur="8.819">very low it indicates we are headed into</text>
  <text start="282.08" dur="5.76">a recession or a depression and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="286.039" dur="4.44">seen this cycle before it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="9.82">something that&amp;#39;s new this was back in</text>
  <text start="290.479" dur="9.761">the 70s in 69 to 70 74 to 75 we</text>
  <text start="297.66" dur="5.91">scene in the 80s we&amp;#39;ve seen it in the</text>
  <text start="300.24" dur="8.19">90s we&amp;#39;ve seen it in 2000 we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="6.99">in 2008 and we&amp;#39;re seeing it again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="5.61">something that we&amp;#39;ve seen over and over</text>
  <text start="310.56" dur="7.05">and over again so what is this indicator</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="6.33">that is showing us that the American</text>
  <text start="317.61" dur="7.23">people are not prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="6.39">coming well we&amp;#39;re in this shutdown think</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="4.62">about all those people that work for the</text>
  <text start="326.76" dur="5.04">government they have families the living</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="4.44">off a paycheck just like everyone else</text>
  <text start="331.8" dur="4.59">and then all of a sudden which they</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="5.34">could never expect to happen the</text>
  <text start="336.39" dur="5.04">shutdown hit and people like alright</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;ve been through this before it will</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="6.51">blow over in two or three weeks not a</text>
  <text start="344.04" dur="7.74">big deal mom there are certain families</text>
  <text start="347.94" dur="7.14">certain people that are struggling right</text>
  <text start="351.78" dur="6.18">now because they were living paycheck to</text>
  <text start="355.08" dur="5.76">paycheck and maybe they didn&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="357.96" dur="5.19">much in savings and the government</text>
  <text start="360.84" dur="4.53">shutdown right now is highlighting just</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="5.18">how much Americans rely on others as</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="5.76">opposed to themselves and how little</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="5.64">they have saved for an emergency or how</text>
  <text start="371.13" dur="8.25">little they prepared for an emergency</text>
  <text start="373.97" dur="9.22">now again being prepared is something</text>
  <text start="379.38" dur="8.91">you do to protect yourself and your</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="6.93">family for a certain event and this</text>
  <text start="388.29" dur="3.99">could be a storm this could be an</text>
  <text start="390.12" dur="2.79">earthquake this could be an economic</text>
  <text start="392.28" dur="3.51">disaster</text>
  <text start="392.91" dur="6.12">it could be war it doesn&amp;#39;t matter and</text>
  <text start="395.79" dur="6.57">you&amp;#39;re never gonna know when it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="399.03" dur="7.11">to hit exactly and how damaging it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="6.57">going to be so right now the government</text>
  <text start="406.14" dur="4.62">shutdown is perfectly proving that</text>
  <text start="408.93" dur="4.62">Americans are not prepared for a</text>
  <text start="410.76" dur="6.36">financial disaster of any kind let alone</text>
  <text start="413.55" dur="4.83">an economic recession the shutdown is</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="4.14">proving just how little government</text>
  <text start="418.38" dur="5.37">actually does and just how financially</text>
  <text start="421.26" dur="5.88">illiterate many Americans have allowed</text>
  <text start="423.75" dur="5.46">themselves to become now not blaming</text>
  <text start="427.14" dur="4.309">this on anyone don&amp;#39;t blame yourselves</text>
  <text start="429.21" dur="6.56">the system was</text>
  <text start="431.449" dur="6.15">they set up to hurt you the system was</text>
  <text start="435.77" dur="4.53">created to keep you in debt this is a</text>
  <text start="437.599" dur="3.96">central bank system and they keep</text>
  <text start="440.3" dur="2.579">telling you we&amp;#39;ll get a credit card</text>
  <text start="441.559" dur="3.061">because think about it they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="442.879" dur="3.9">telling you oh you know what be</text>
  <text start="444.62" dur="6.12">financially independent buy gold buy</text>
  <text start="446.779" dur="5.31">silver stock up on food water don&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="450.74" dur="3.81">out loans they&amp;#39;re not telling you that</text>
  <text start="452.089" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re saying hey take out a loan for</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="5.459">college hey take out a loan for a car</text>
  <text start="457.189" dur="4.29">hey take out a loan for a house you want</text>
  <text start="460.009" dur="3.421">to buy groceries can&amp;#39;t afford don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="461.479" dur="2.91">worry this credit card what you want</text>
  <text start="463.43" dur="2.669">this product don&amp;#39;t worry there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="464.389" dur="3.661">credit card if you don&amp;#39;t make enough</text>
  <text start="466.099" dur="4.5">money and a lot of Americans don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="4.109">enough money so what do they do they</text>
  <text start="470.599" dur="4.801">have to resort to credit this was part</text>
  <text start="472.159" dur="5.07">of the central bank&amp;#39;s plan 60% of</text>
  <text start="475.4" dur="4.47">Americans have less than a thousand in</text>
  <text start="477.229" dur="5.31">savings for a rainy day fund or for an</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="5.099">immediate emergency and it&amp;#39;s been about</text>
  <text start="482.539" dur="4.021">ten years since their Great Recession</text>
  <text start="484.969" dur="3.75">now we know we&amp;#39;ve been living in this</text>
  <text start="486.56" dur="4.65">illusion so it&amp;#39;s been 10 years since</text>
  <text start="488.719" dur="4.891">they started the illusion and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="4.56">still in the solution but the recession</text>
  <text start="493.61" dur="4.559">left many americans jobless with no</text>
  <text start="495.77" dur="5.149">money or a lot of Americans with a</text>
  <text start="498.169" dur="5.25">part-time job instead of a full-time job</text>
  <text start="500.919" dur="6.61">the government shutdown serves as a</text>
  <text start="503.419" dur="6.81">painful warning and a preview for what</text>
  <text start="507.529" dur="6.901">will happen once unemployment rises from</text>
  <text start="510.229" dur="7.141">50-year lows Americans are far too</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="4.83">dependent on others including the</text>
  <text start="517.37" dur="3.779">government remember this is what the</text>
  <text start="519.26" dur="4.17">deep state wanted they wanted everyone</text>
  <text start="521.149" dur="5.701">dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="5.67">why because it&amp;#39;s easier to control the</text>
  <text start="526.85" dur="4.83">population when you&amp;#39;re dependent on the</text>
  <text start="529.1" dur="5.429">government and we&amp;#39;re also dependent on</text>
  <text start="531.68" dur="5.61">the central bank system they need to</text>
  <text start="534.529" dur="5.49">create currency or the entire system</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="5.849">dies the government needs to borrow or</text>
  <text start="540.019" dur="5.341">the entire system dies think look how</text>
  <text start="543.139" dur="6.361">they created and developed this whole</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="6.75">thing the people are dependent on the</text>
  <text start="549.5" dur="4.5">government the mass that the vast</text>
  <text start="552.11" dur="5.969">majority of the people in this country</text>
  <text start="554" dur="7.14">the government is dependent on the</text>
  <text start="558.079" dur="5.76">Federal Reserve the central bank because</text>
  <text start="561.14" dur="3.9">without the central bank the government</text>
  <text start="563.839" dur="3.69">can&amp;#39;t borrow</text>
  <text start="565.04" dur="4.76">without the government borrowing well</text>
  <text start="567.529" dur="6.48">they can&amp;#39;t make people dependent on them</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="7.99">so where is the problem it goes right</text>
  <text start="574.009" dur="6.781">back to the central bank but my point is</text>
  <text start="577.79" dur="7.739">is that this government shutdown is just</text>
  <text start="580.79" dur="8.239">giving us a window into what it would be</text>
  <text start="585.529" dur="7.56">like if the vast majority of people</text>
  <text start="589.029" dur="7.3">received no paychecks if the American</text>
  <text start="593.089" dur="8.521">people weren&amp;#39;t able to go to the store</text>
  <text start="596.329" dur="7.111">and purchase food this is showing us</text>
  <text start="601.61" dur="3.57">that if credit breaks down remember</text>
  <text start="603.44" dur="3.6">credit as part of the central bank</text>
  <text start="605.18" dur="6.12">system if it breaks down like it did</text>
  <text start="607.04" dur="9.239">back in 2008 if it breaks down supplies</text>
  <text start="611.3" dur="7.17">to the stores would cease and whole how</text>
  <text start="616.279" dur="5.821">would you survive during this period</text>
  <text start="618.47" dur="6.059">during this transition now to get out of</text>
  <text start="622.1" dur="6.45">this central bank system we need to move</text>
  <text start="624.529" dur="8.191">into a different system that period is</text>
  <text start="628.55" dur="6.24">the transition where they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="632.72" dur="5.34">preparations to move everything remember</text>
  <text start="634.79" dur="6.75">queue has been telling us that gold will</text>
  <text start="638.06" dur="5.969">bring down the Fed they also understand</text>
  <text start="641.54" dur="5.01">that there&amp;#39;s going to be a structure</text>
  <text start="644.029" dur="4.68">type of change what it&amp;#39;s exactly going</text>
  <text start="646.55" dur="4.17">to be we don&amp;#39;t know I do believe that</text>
  <text start="648.709" dur="3.511">they&amp;#39;ll be taking over the central bank</text>
  <text start="650.72" dur="5.07">and eventually destroy the central bank</text>
  <text start="652.22" dur="5.07">and if they do do this we have to</text>
  <text start="655.79" dur="4.83">remember one thing that&amp;#39;s very important</text>
  <text start="657.29" dur="5.31">most of Americans yes they have jewelry</text>
  <text start="660.62" dur="5.43">but they&amp;#39;ve been they haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="662.6" dur="5.37">stacking gold or silver so they have to</text>
