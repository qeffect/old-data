  <text start="50.79" dur="5.009">going to do is we&amp;#39;re going to head out</text>
  <text start="51.809" dur="7.651">to Spain and Spain is really getting hit</text>
  <text start="55.799" dur="7.021">hard right now the Spaniards between the</text>
  <text start="59.46" dur="6.39">ages of 18 to 24 are saying that they</text>
  <text start="62.82" dur="4.38">will take any job whatsoever doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="65.85" dur="5.309">matter how much you&amp;#39;re going to pay us</text>
  <text start="67.2" dur="6.209">we just want a job and forty eight point</text>
  <text start="71.159" dur="5.46">six percent of Spaniards have said this</text>
  <text start="73.409" dur="5.88">and the reason why they have said this</text>
  <text start="76.619" dur="5.161">is because there is just no work out</text>
  <text start="79.289" dur="5.19">there at this time eighty four point</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="6.089">nine percent felt very or fairly likely</text>
  <text start="84.479" dur="5.43">to have work on what is available 61.7</text>
  <text start="87.869" dur="4.411">percent considered equally likely to</text>
  <text start="89.909" dur="4.471">have to go abroad and seventy nine point</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="4.89">two percent said they need to study more</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="5.46">despite this an overwhelming majority</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="5.04">eighty percent are convinced that at</text>
  <text start="99.84" dur="4.919">least in the near future we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="6.839">be financially dependent on their family</text>

  <text start="118.38" dur="7.919">hundred jobs that&amp;#39;s how bad it is there</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="8.131">are no jobs people are struggling and</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="6.361">they cannot make ends meet at all and</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="7.11">that&amp;#39;s how difficult it is here in</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="6.84">America warm our Walmart put-up job</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="3.22">openings for about six hundred people</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="4.74">and they</text>
  <text start="140.47" dur="8.04">r23 applications to get a job at Walmart</text>
  <text start="144.24" dur="6.88">things are really bad all over but you</text>
  <text start="148.51" dur="4.89">know what the US government the Fed the</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="5.13">eurozone they&amp;#39;re keeping the illusion up</text>
  <text start="153.4" dur="5.76">that everything is fine and we are in</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="5.94">this fabulous recovery how does it feel</text>
  <text start="159.16" dur="6.57">doesn&amp;#39;t it feel fabulous now out in</text>
  <text start="162.19" dur="5.7">Russia the VTB which is the second</text>
  <text start="165.73" dur="4.08">largest bank in Russia they are</text>
  <text start="167.89" dur="4.5">complaining over the lowering of its</text>
  <text start="169.81" dur="4.77">long-term rating by Fitch saying the</text>
  <text start="172.39" dur="4.41">assessment is incomplete due to a lack</text>
  <text start="174.58" dur="4.25">of internal information and the</text>
  <text start="176.8" dur="4.83">conclusions have been since</text>
  <text start="178.83" dur="5.17">sensationalized and this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="181.63" dur="4.71">that the bank does not maintain contract</text>
  <text start="184" dur="4.94">relations with Fitch Ratings the agency</text>
  <text start="186.34" dur="4.98">has no access to nonpublic information</text>
  <text start="188.94" dur="4.36">provided to other rating agencies and</text>
  <text start="191.32" dur="4.11">does not possess complete information</text>
  <text start="193.3" dur="4.92">for an objective assessment on the</text>
  <text start="195.43" dur="6">credit quality of VTB and we have to</text>
  <text start="198.22" dur="5.25">remember that right now China has been</text>
  <text start="201.43" dur="4.98">setting up their own credit rating</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="7.5">agency and these credit rating agencies</text>
  <text start="206.41" dur="6.84">are usually paid by other companies to</text>
  <text start="210.97" dur="6">rate them and this is how it works and</text>
  <text start="213.25" dur="6.269">we can see during 2008 SMP Fitch Moody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="5.28">they were all rating the subprime</text>
  <text start="219.519" dur="4.921">securities as triple-a and look what</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="4.35">happened there the entire thing just</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="4.95">collapsed and everyone was getting them</text>
  <text start="226.6" dur="4.139">because they were rated triple-a so if i</text>
  <text start="229.39" dur="3.39">was looking at these credit rating</text>
  <text start="230.739" dur="4.201">agencies i wouldn&amp;#39;t take it you know i</text>
  <text start="232.78" dur="4.11">wouldn&amp;#39;t put too much stock in what they</text>
  <text start="234.94" dur="5.31">are saying at this point and we also</text>
  <text start="236.89" dur="9.06">have to remember that Russia China North</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="7.95">Korea Iran Syria and other nations who</text>
  <text start="245.95" dur="5.34">are not with the private western central</text>
  <text start="248.2" dur="4.8">bank central bankers go after these</text>
  <text start="251.29" dur="3.81">country and that countries and they</text>
  <text start="253" dur="4.739">tried to provoke them and this is what</text>
  <text start="255.1" dur="5.639">they do and this is what they always try</text>
  <text start="257.739" dur="6.501">to do because they those countries that</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="7.201">are not or do not have a central bank</text>
  <text start="264.24" dur="6.25">controlled by the western central</text>
  <text start="267.94" dur="4.92">bankers they are considered enemies of</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="3.5">the central bankers and we can see this</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="4.3">happening all over the</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="6">now the Baltic Dry Index crashes again</text>
  <text start="277.16" dur="4.18">another eighteen percent in two days and</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="3.27">for those people who don&amp;#39;t know what the</text>
  <text start="281.34" dur="4.44">Baltic Dry Index is I&amp;#39;ll read this to</text>
  <text start="283.26" dur="4.29">you changes in the Baltic Dry Index can</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="4.8">give investors insight into global</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="5.01">supply and demand trends this change is</text>
  <text start="290.58" dur="5.27">often considered a leading indicator of</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="5.54">future economic growth or contraction</text>
  <text start="295.85" dur="4.39">because the good shipped our raw</text>
  <text start="298.1" dur="4.03">pre-production material which is</text>
  <text start="300.24" dur="4.2">typically in an area with very low</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="5.7">levels of speculation and what has</text>
  <text start="304.44" dur="6.81">happened is is that the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="6.78">drop by eighteen percent and this is a</text>
  <text start="311.25" dur="5.37">in a four-month low and the index is</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="5.25">utterly collapse over forty percent in</text>
  <text start="316.62" dur="6.33">the last two weeks and the last time we</text>
  <text start="319.86" dur="5.01">saw this happen where it dropped quite a</text>
  <text start="322.95" dur="6.42">bit and we&amp;#39;ll have to see what happens</text>
  <text start="324.87" dur="8.4">later on but in May May twentieth of</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="6.63">2008 the index reached its record high</text>
  <text start="333.27" dur="5.04">level since its introduction in 1985</text>
  <text start="336" dur="5.1">reaching eleven thousand seven hundred</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="6.36">and ninety three points half a year</text>
  <text start="341.1" dur="7.1">later on December fifth of 2008 now this</text>
  <text start="344.67" dur="9.18">is the same year the index dropped by</text>
  <text start="348.2" dur="8.08">ninety-four percent to 663 look how</text>
  <text start="353.85" dur="4.56">quickly this can change and they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="5.88">worried right now because it is because</text>
  <text start="358.41" dur="7.05">it is down about forty percent right now</text>
  <text start="362.16" dur="6.36">and this is an indicator that something</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="9.18">is going wrong that something is about</text>
  <text start="368.52" dur="8.76">to happen now the IMF is now adding four</text>
  <text start="374.64" dur="4.92">European countries to the financial risk</text>
  <text start="377.28" dur="4.74">list and of course we have all the</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="5.61">others we have you know Cyprus we have</text>
  <text start="382.02" dur="6.93">Portugal we have Spain we have Italy we</text>
  <text start="385.17" dur="5.46">have greece and spain i don&amp;#39;t know if i</text>
  <text start="388.95" dur="4.4">said that once pain but right now</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re adding dead mark finland norway</text>
  <text start="393.35" dur="4.96">poland to its list of countries that</text>
  <text start="396.18" dur="4.35">must have regular check-ups of their</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="4.08">financial sectors under an effort to</text>
  <text start="400.53" dur="3.75">prevent a repeat of the global financial</text>
  <text start="402.39" dur="3.55">crisis and they&amp;#39;re worried about these</text>
  <text start="404.28" dur="4.83">countries again</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="6.48">we can see that this whole eurozone is</text>
  <text start="409.11" dur="6.88">completely falling apart and these</text>
  <text start="412.42" dur="6.33">countries cannot make it they cannot</text>
  <text start="415.99" dur="5.1">have the amount of debt they cannot make</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="5.04">it with high unemployment with the</text>
  <text start="421.09" dur="4.26">people suffering can&amp;#39;t find jobs and if</text>
  <text start="423.79" dur="5.07">you have a hundred thousand people</text>
  <text start="425.35" dur="6.99">applying for what was a 600 jobs we have</text>
  <text start="428.86" dur="5.1">major major problems and everyone is</text>
  <text start="432.34" dur="3.48">just sweeping this under the rug not</text>
  <text start="433.96" dur="4.23">everyone but the government&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="435.82" dur="3.96">central bankers are pretending that</text>
  <text start="438.19" dur="3.96">everything is fine because they do not</text>
  <text start="439.78" dur="4.77">want to let on that something is wrong</text>
  <text start="442.15" dur="4.71">because all of a sudden if they do they</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="3.54">would be panic everywhere and they</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="3.87">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to steal the wealth</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="5.52">from every single person and they want</text>
  <text start="450.73" dur="5.07">everyone in to the stock markets they</text>
  <text start="453.61" dur="4.44">want everyone in and they want to keep</text>
  <text start="455.8" dur="4.56">building this up and when the time is</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="4.77">right everything will come crashing down</text>
  <text start="460.36" dur="5.64">and all of those people will lose</text>
  <text start="462.82" dur="4.83">millions of dollars they&amp;#39;ll lose their</text>
  <text start="466" dur="4.38">investment they&amp;#39;ll lose their pensions</text>
  <text start="467.65" dur="5.97">they will lose pretty much everything</text>
  <text start="470.38" dur="5.7">and at this time no one will have work</text>
  <text start="473.62" dur="5.04">and this is what they are doing they did</text>
  <text start="476.08" dur="7.5">it in 2008 and they&amp;#39;re going to do it</text>
  <text start="478.66" dur="7.22">again and to help this along of course</text>
  <text start="483.58" dur="6.3">there is Obamacare and as we know</text>
  <text start="485.88" dur="7.62">Obamacare was never intended to help the</text>
  <text start="489.88" dur="7.17">people it was never intended to give</text>
  <text start="493.5" dur="5.83">inexpensive health insurance to the</text>
  <text start="497.05" dur="5.01">people of the United States it was</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="5.76">always intended to make the insurance</text>
  <text start="502.06" dur="6.56">companies profitable to bring in tax</text>
  <text start="505.09" dur="6.06">revenue so they can maintain the</text>
  <text start="508.62" dur="4.87">incredible amount of debt that the</text>
  <text start="511.15" dur="6.15">United States is accumulating and this</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="6.33">is why Obamacare was created and it was</text>
  <text start="517.3" dur="5.7">not to give health insurance to every</text>
  <text start="519.82" dur="6.66">single person inexpensively so they can</text>
  <text start="523" dur="5.67">live better lives it was not that at all</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="4.8">because if it was you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="528.67" dur="5.1">add taxes in you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to add</text>
  <text start="531.28" dur="5.7">penalties in and this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="533.77" dur="5.46">done because we can see that this is not</text>
  <text start="536.98" dur="5.22">for the people and if</text>
  <text start="539.23" dur="4.74">look at this Obamacare is projected by</text>
  <text start="542.2" dur="6.87">the Congressional Budget Office to</text>
  <text start="543.97" dur="9.69">funnel in one trillion dollars over the</text>
  <text start="549.07" dur="8.04">next decade 2014 to 20 23 from American</text>
  <text start="553.66" dur="7.08">taxpayers through Washington to the</text>
  <text start="557.11" dur="6.27">health insurance companies Obamacare&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="4.41">government run exchanges isn&amp;#39;t even a</text>
  <text start="563.38" dur="3.84">full-fledged private insurance rather</text>
  <text start="565.15" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s sort of like a private-public</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="6.24">hybrid private insurance companies pay</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="6.6">for costs below 45,000 then if anything</text>
  <text start="573.46" dur="5.1">is above that the taxpayers generously</text>
  <text start="576.4" dur="5.49">pick up the tab and the government pays</text>
  <text start="578.56" dur="6.27">for the rest so insurers not only don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="581.89" dur="4.92">have to pay out all of their costs they</text>
  <text start="584.83" dur="4.41">also don&amp;#39;t have to swallow all of their</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="6.66">losses and like I said before there is a</text>
  <text start="589.24" dur="6">clause in Obamacare for bailouts if the</text>
  <text start="593.47" dur="4.92">insurance companies are losing money</text>
  <text start="595.24" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t you worry the government will make</text>
  <text start="598.39" dur="4.77">up the difference and this goes on to</text>
  <text start="600.61" dur="5.37">say if an insurance company expects its</text>
  <text start="603.16" dur="5.16">costs in a given year to be X and those</text>
  <text start="605.98" dur="6.06">costs end up being more than X plus 2</text>
  <text start="608.32" dur="7.05">percent tax payers will cover at least</text>
  <text start="612.04" dur="6.9">eighty percent of any additional costs</text>
  <text start="615.37" dur="6.6">the ensure a cruise and we can see what</text>
  <text start="618.94" dur="5.64">is happening here there are hidden taxes</text>
  <text start="621.97" dur="4.71">within Obamacare there are penalties if</text>
  <text start="624.58" dur="4.29">you don&amp;#39;t take it there are penalties if</text>
  <text start="626.68" dur="5.54">businesses don&amp;#39;t take it and what this</text>
  <text start="628.87" dur="7.68">is going to do is this is going to</text>
  <text start="632.22" dur="6.07">completely decimate the job market</text>
  <text start="636.55" dur="4.53">because we can see already that</text>
  <text start="638.29" dur="5.55">companies are taking the full time</text>
  <text start="641.08" dur="4.86">employees making them part time give</text>
  <text start="643.84" dur="3.57">them a certain number of hours so they</text>
  <text start="645.94" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t have to pay for health insurance</text>
  <text start="647.41" dur="3.54">and they&amp;#39;re telling these people to go</text>
  <text start="649.27" dur="3.24">on the exchanges and of course once</text>
  <text start="650.95" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re in the part-time position you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="652.51" dur="4.2">not going out buying these policies</text>
  <text start="654.01" dur="5.4">because it is too expensive and as we</text>
  <text start="656.71" dur="5.66">know these policies are not cheap plus</text>
  <text start="659.41" dur="6.69">the deductibles are high so most likely</text>
  <text start="662.37" dur="5.8">you will never ever receive any benefit</text>
  <text start="666.1" dur="4.74">from the health insurance company unless</text>
  <text start="668.17" dur="4.2">your illness is catastrophic and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="670.84" dur="2.04">in the hospital but of course you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.37" dur="2.28">gonna have to pay</text>
  <text start="672.88" dur="3.33">that first five to ten thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="674.65" dur="3.39">whatever your deductible is first and</text>
  <text start="676.21" dur="4.26">then the insurance company will kick in</text>
  <text start="678.04" dur="4.68">afterwards so they&amp;#39;re going to decimate</text>
  <text start="680.47" dur="4.47">the job market and we already see it</text>
  <text start="682.72" dur="4.62">happening forever 21 and home depot and</text>
  <text start="684.94" dur="5.04">many many other companies where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="687.34" dur="4.26">cutting the hours or they are saying</text>
  <text start="689.98" dur="3.78">listen we&amp;#39;re only going to give</text>
  <text start="691.6" dur="4.38">insurance to your spouse the one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="693.76" dur="4.41">working here your wife or your husband</text>
  <text start="695.98" dur="4.98">will need to go to the exchanges so that</text>
  <text start="698.17" dur="5.31">person now is making less money and if</text>
  <text start="700.96" dur="5.37">you decide not to take it you have to</text>
  <text start="703.48" dur="4.8">pay a penalty or attacks and that goes</text>
  <text start="706.33" dur="3.96">to the government and then funnel to the</text>
  <text start="708.28" dur="5.1">insurance company so everyone&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="710.29" dur="6.21">a piece of the action because this is to</text>

  <text start="724.18" dur="6.81">set up to do and again like I always say</text>
  <text start="727.81" dur="5.73">the title of the bill the law now is the</text>
  <text start="730.99" dur="6.15">Affordable Care Act whatever they put on</text>
  <text start="733.54" dur="5.7">there it is always the opposite it is</text>

  <text start="745.47" dur="6.61">now we understand that the government</text>
  <text start="748.12" dur="6.3">wants to spy on us with NSA with DHS and</text>
  <text start="752.08" dur="5.64">their fusion centers and they like to</text>
  <text start="754.42" dur="5.7">take control and mostly what they like</text>
  <text start="757.72" dur="4.29">to do is tax the people because when</text>
  <text start="760.12" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re entering this end game they</text>
  <text start="762.01" dur="6.57">continually throw on more and more taxes</text>
  <text start="764.56" dur="7.11">and I saw this today where the</text>

  <text start="793.18" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re going to help us the Home Energy</text>
  <text start="794.95" dur="3.77">scoring tool can be a powerful motivator</text>

  <text start="827.64" dur="4.889">as soon as the pro program becomes</text>
  <text start="829.71" dur="5.129">available and soon it will be mandatory</text>

  <text start="843" dur="5.22">the size of your home matters because</text>
  <text start="844.62" dur="6.57">larger homes use more energy and this is</text>
  <text start="848.22" dur="6.48">all being done so they know how much to</text>
  <text start="851.19" dur="6.39">tax you for your energy uses in your</text>

  <text start="857.58" dur="4.44">carbon taxes that will eventually hit</text>
  <text start="860.01" dur="4.53">even though we have record cold</text>

  <text start="864.54" dur="6.45">reason global warming is out there again</text>
  <text start="867.3" dur="7.2">is to impose carbon taxes on every</text>
  <text start="870.99" dur="5.31">single person and this is going to</text>
  <text start="874.5" dur="4.71">definitely be part of it because during</text>
  <text start="876.3" dur="5.25">the endgame what governments do just</text>
  <text start="879.21" dur="4.29">like in France they tried the echo tax</text>
  <text start="881.55" dur="3.72">and the people went crazy over that and</text>
  <text start="883.5" dur="4.74">said absolutely no way but they did</text>
  <text start="885.27" dur="4.98">impose a income tax on those people</text>
  <text start="888.24" dur="4.44">making more than 70 making more than a</text>
  <text start="890.25" dur="4.95">million dollars and they imposed a 75</text>
  <text start="892.68" dur="4.95">percent tax here in America we have</text>
  <text start="895.2" dur="4.77">Obamacare and many other taxes and other</text>
  <text start="897.63" dur="5.04">laws where they&amp;#39;re going after people</text>
  <text start="899.97" dur="4.74">overseas and getting the banks like in</text>
  <text start="902.67" dur="4.53">Switzerland to turn in those people who</text>
  <text start="904.71" dur="5.07">have accounts in those banks and those</text>
  <text start="907.2" dur="5.009">people who have US passports but work in</text>
  <text start="909.78" dur="4.86">another country they want to tax those</text>
  <text start="912.209" dur="4.651">people and this will be leading into</text>
  <text start="914.64" dur="5.31">another tax and they will score your</text>
  <text start="916.86" dur="5.16">home and from that score what they will</text>
  <text start="919.95" dur="3.87">do is say okay now you need to pay</text>
  <text start="922.02" dur="4.05">twelve hundred dollars because you</text>
  <text start="923.82" dur="3.959">scored very low on your home now you</text>

  <text start="935.79" dur="2.8">would you like and this is how they are</text>
  <text start="937.83" dur="5.11">playing this</text>
  <text start="938.59" dur="8.13">out now a watchdog group says that the</text>
  <text start="942.94" dur="6.06">NSA snooping failed to prevent any type</text>

  <text start="949" dur="6.18">knew this that the NSA was not there to</text>
  <text start="952.09" dur="6.63">spy to try to find terrorists because we</text>

  <text start="967.6" dur="5.58">this information retrieved and they</text>
  <text start="970.54" dur="6.21">would do it maybe on paper maybe encode</text>

  <text start="982.63" dur="4.14">really what it&amp;#39;s set up for is to spy on</text>
  <text start="984.64" dur="3.96">every single American because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="986.77" dur="3.66">contracted with pretty much every single</text>

  <text start="996.58" dur="7.56">possible they even intercepted computers</text>

  <text start="1007.44" dur="4.98">have a backdoor into knowing what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1009.33" dur="5.4">doing and right now out of the 225</text>

  <text start="1042.63" dur="7.26">that normally would not be passed pretty</text>
  <text start="1044.94" dur="7.95">much like Obamacare now what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1049.89" dur="5.82">now is the states are trying to rein in</text>
  <text start="1052.89" dur="5.25">the NSA and what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="1055.71" dur="4.05">California state senators drop</text>
  <text start="1058.14" dur="3.42">legislation that would prevent the state</text>
  <text start="1059.76" dur="4.25">from aiding the NSA&amp;#39;s collection of</text>
  <text start="1061.56" dur="4.83">phone and internet made a metadata on</text>
  <text start="1064.01" dur="4.39">grounds it is a direct threat to our</text>
  <text start="1066.39" dur="3.42">liberty and freedom yeah and it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="1068.4" dur="4.15">much in violation of the Fourth</text>
  <text start="1069.81" dur="4.57">Amendment on the same day along</text>
  <text start="1072.55" dur="4.8">acre in Oklahoma introduced a similar</text>
  <text start="1074.38" dur="5.58">bill and Arizona has also introduced a</text>
  <text start="1077.35" dur="6.81">full state proposed reform and Missouri</text>
  <text start="1079.96" dur="6.27">Kansas have introduced legislation just</text>
  <text start="1084.16" dur="4.17">like those other states and Washington</text>
  <text start="1086.23" dur="3.84">and Utah and few other states are</text>
  <text start="1088.33" dur="4.14">mulling over the model legislation as</text>
  <text start="1090.07" dur="4.32">well so it looks like the states are now</text>
  <text start="1092.47" dur="3.72">taking a step back looking at this and</text>
  <text start="1094.39" dur="3.66">saying you know what we need to start</text>
  <text start="1096.19" dur="5.01">doing something and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1098.05" dur="5.28">put legislation together to rein in what</text>
  <text start="1101.2" dur="3.6">has gotten completely out of control and</text>
  <text start="1103.33" dur="3.78">the reason why it&amp;#39;s out of control is</text>
  <text start="1104.8" dur="4.5">because they were worried they&amp;#39;re afraid</text>
  <text start="1107.11" dur="4.56">and they need to know what everyone is</text>
  <text start="1109.3" dur="4.86">doing because they understand that this</text>
  <text start="1111.67" dur="5.25">collapse is coming and we are getting</text>
  <text start="1114.16" dur="4.44">close and they need to go and put these</text>
  <text start="1116.92" dur="3.75">people on certain lists that are going</text>

  <text start="1127.12" dur="7.5">all of this has happened this is why the</text>
  <text start="1129.85" dur="7.74">DHS right now is giving grants to every</text>

  <text start="1137.59" dur="8.37">and having them pretty much be compliant</text>
  <text start="1142.27" dur="6.18">to what the DHS wants and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1145.96" dur="4.68">seeing now is thousands of surveillance</text>

  <text start="1155.68" dur="3.96">not there for crime the cameras are</text>
  <text start="1157.6" dur="4.08">there to keep an eye on every single</text>
  <text start="1159.64" dur="3.63">person so they know what everyone is</text>
  <text start="1161.68" dur="3.66">doing their fitted with facial</text>
  <text start="1163.27" dur="3.78">recognition they are then hooked up into</text>
  <text start="1165.34" dur="3.99">a database where they take that</text>
  <text start="1167.05" dur="5.1">information and they compared to who you</text>
  <text start="1169.33" dur="4.8">are who you are meeting with and pretty</text>
  <text start="1172.15" dur="4.86">soon once they get all of our DNA</text>
  <text start="1174.13" dur="5.9">information that will be supplied once</text>
  <text start="1177.01" dur="5.64">they get the real ID all enabled and</text>
  <text start="1180.03" dur="4.36">activated in every single state that</text>
  <text start="1182.65" dur="3.21">will also play into the database and</text>
  <text start="1184.39" dur="3.87">just think about what they&amp;#39;re doing here</text>
  <text start="1185.86" dur="3.57">they have the real ID which everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1188.26" dur="4.11">driver&amp;#39;s license with all your</text>

  <text start="1235.58" dur="4.23">very worried and put them into</text>
  <text start="1236.99" dur="5.1">interrogation it&amp;#39;s almost like the TSA</text>
  <text start="1239.81" dur="6.27">lists but about a hundred times worse</text>
  <text start="1242.09" dur="5.52">and of course the officials are out</text>
  <text start="1246.08" dur="3.51">there with all these cameras and getting</text>
  <text start="1247.61" dur="3.69">the grants and stuff say that data is</text>
  <text start="1249.59" dur="3.36">not kept at determine if the cameras are</text>
  <text start="1251.3" dur="4.2">driving down krumwell of course there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1252.95" dur="5.87">no data being kept because this has</text>
  <text start="1255.5" dur="7.17">nothing to do with crime whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="1258.82" dur="6.09">again Homeland Security is infiltrating</text>

  <text start="1280.91" dur="5.82">they are to the federal agencies</text>
  <text start="1282.91" dur="6.64">mandates and equally unsettling however</text>
  <text start="1286.73" dur="5.7">is that all of the added surveillance</text>
  <text start="1289.55" dur="5.19">and added firepower crime is not going</text>
  <text start="1292.43" dur="4.8">down because all of this stuff that</text>
  <text start="1294.74" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re doing is not to fight crime it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1453.17" dur="5.3">sell any type of natural resources and</text>
  <text start="1455.92" dur="5.26">that&amp;#39;s why they had to go into Yemen</text>
  <text start="1458.47" dur="5.17">they had to go into Libya Lebanon and</text>
  <text start="1461.18" dur="4.41">Iraq because they had to put them back</text>

  <text start="1476.1" dur="4.26">government have to do well they have to</text>
  <text start="1478.5" dur="9.17">send in drones they have to send in</text>

  <text start="1489.93" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;ll train the government people and</text>
  <text start="1491.64" dur="4.65">this is all about maintaining control</text>

  <text start="1496.29" dur="7.94">dollar falls apart and now the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1500.01" dur="6.87">in Sudan and Somalia France is in the</text>

  <text start="1518.01" dur="4.549">them al-qaeda and we can see this</text>
  <text start="1520.559" dur="4.231">happening everywhere and right now</text>
  <text start="1522.559" dur="4.721">american troops secretly deployed in</text>

  <text start="1527.28" dur="4.35">in Somalia as trainers and advisers is</text>
  <text start="1529.47" dur="4.29">not surprising as the entire African</text>

  <text start="1533.76" dur="4.47">the United States and we see this</text>
  <text start="1535.44" dur="7.68">happening in Sudan in Sudan there is a</text>
  <text start="1538.23" dur="7.32">puppet government and in the rebels are</text>
  <text start="1543.12" dur="3.54">controlled by China and Chinese pumping</text>
  <text start="1545.55" dur="3.18">billions of dollars into the</text>
  <text start="1546.66" dur="3.33">infrastructure and we can see what is</text>
  <text start="1548.73" dur="4.56">happening the same thing happened in</text>
  <text start="1549.99" dur="5.37">Libya China was pumping in billions of</text>

  <text start="1555.36" dur="6.63">all of a sudden United States went into</text>
  <text start="1558.45" dur="6">Libya overthrew Gaddafi and put the</text>

  <text start="1564.45" dur="4.41">and we can see this is happening all</text>
  <text start="1566.97" dur="5.459">over the place but what&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="1568.86" dur="6.39">that again the rebels in these countries</text>
  <text start="1572.429" dur="6.031">are fighting back Baghdad says it will</text>
  <text start="1575.25" dur="7.26">sue anyone who buys unauthorized oil</text>
  <text start="1578.46" dur="6.39">from Iraqi Kurdistan and Libya has</text>

  <text start="1584.85" dur="4.47">attempting to load crude from its</text>
  <text start="1586.89" dur="4.47">insurgent east and what we seeing right</text>
  <text start="1589.32" dur="3.48">now is the puppet government who are</text>
  <text start="1591.36" dur="2.58">controlled by the West private western</text>
  <text start="1592.8" dur="5.34">central bankers and the US government</text>
  <text start="1593.94" dur="8.25">are saying listen if you buy oil from</text>
  <text start="1598.14" dur="6.12">the rebels which of course are not using</text>
  <text start="1602.19" dur="3">the US dollar as the reserve currency to</text>

  <text start="1605.19" dur="9.27">for any type of currency or even gold we</text>
  <text start="1609.15" dur="7.8">are going to sue or destroy the tankers</text>
  <text start="1614.46" dur="5.37">because the central bankers will lose</text>
  <text start="1616.95" dur="9.54">money if they do this and this is why</text>
  <text start="1619.83" dur="9.6">this is happening right now okay now we</text>
  <text start="1626.49" dur="4.77">understand eventually the private</text>
  <text start="1629.43" dur="4.71">western central bankers are going to</text>
  <text start="1631.26" dur="4.71">start a war and China is going to be</text>

  <text start="1635.97" dur="4.53">involved but China is the main target at</text>
  <text start="1638.67" dur="3.24">this time because the United States the</text>

  <text start="1991.679" dur="5.281">to let everyone know that china is about</text>
  <text start="1995.249" dur="3.51">to do something are they really going to</text>
  <text start="1996.96" dur="4.409">do something I don&amp;#39;t think so but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1998.759" dur="4.29">have to wait and see and it goes on to</text>
  <text start="2001.369" dur="3.571">say that some of these warships that</text>
  <text start="2003.049" dur="3.241">China has been building include</text>
  <text start="2004.94" dur="3.66">hovercraft</text>
  <text start="2006.29" dur="5.76">crafts capable of carrying one battalion</text>

  <text start="2012.05" dur="5.79">all building up before what we know that</text>
  <text start="2015.89" dur="4.38">is coming and which is going to be world</text>
  <text start="2017.84" dur="5.43">war 3 and this will eventually happen</text>
  <text start="2020.27" dur="5.37">because they understand that the</text>
  <text start="2023.27" dur="4.74">economic situation is dire they</text>
  <text start="2025.64" dur="6.75">understand that the dollar is imploding</text>

  <text start="2037.7" dur="4.44">be blamed for the collapse they will</text>
  <text start="2039.89" dur="6.78">definitely blame this on some other</text>
  <text start="2042.14" dur="7.35">country because eventually they think</text>
  <text start="2046.67" dur="5.37">they will have this world war three the</text>
  <text start="2049.49" dur="5.939">in-system will be you know reset it</text>
  <text start="2052.04" dur="5.97">might even be nuclear and whoever is</text>

  <text start="2065.63" dur="5.13">lot of the population during this time</text>
  <text start="2068.179" dur="5.401">period and they will start the entire</text>
  <text start="2070.76" dur="4.83">system all over and this is why they are</text>
  <text start="2073.58" dur="5.28">after every single country&amp;#39;s natural</text>
  <text start="2075.59" dur="6.75">resources at this point and in the u.s.</text>

  <text start="2082.34" dur="5.61">military forces have been building up</text>
  <text start="2085.19" dur="4.8">and it&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re coming to the end game</text>
  <text start="2087.95" dur="4.56">here that is the whole reason why this</text>
  <text start="2089.99" dur="4.59">is all coming out now this is the whole</text>
  <text start="2092.51" dur="5.73">reason for the spying this is the whole</text>
  <text start="2094.58" dur="6.54">reason for keeping track of every single</text>

  <text start="2107.39" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and eventually they</text>
  <text start="2109.25" dur="5.37">need to disarm the American people and</text>
  <text start="2111.59" dur="4.68">we should see some false flags coming up</text>
  <text start="2114.62" dur="4.26">where we&amp;#39;re going to see some type of</text>
  <text start="2116.27" dur="4.86">horrific event that will include</text>
  <text start="2118.88" dur="5.1">shooting children it will be bloody and</text>
  <text start="2121.13" dur="5.37">they write as soon as this happens you</text>
  <text start="2123.98" dur="5.25">will know because the president the</text>
  <text start="2126.5" dur="5.19">government will be right on it and this</text>
  <text start="2129.23" dur="5.79">will be played out like you&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="2131.69" dur="6.42">seen before and the President Obama will</text>
  <text start="2135.02" dur="5.13">come out saying that we need gun control</text>
  <text start="2138.11" dur="4.65">gun control gun control as soon</text>
  <text start="2140.15" dur="6.449">as it happens and you will definitely</text>
  <text start="2142.76" dur="5.519">see this coming up soon now we</text>
  <text start="2146.599" dur="3.21">understand that target was hit we</text>
  <text start="2148.279" dur="4.191">understand that the market was hit and</text>
  <text start="2149.809" dur="5.97">now there was another report saying that</text>
  <text start="2152.47" dur="6.309">holiday hackers hit at least three other</text>
  <text start="2155.779" dur="5.191">major retailers at this time and right</text>
  <text start="2158.779" dur="3.211">now the other retailers are unknown and</text>
  <text start="2160.97" dur="3.809">they&amp;#39;re not releasing the information</text>
  <text start="2161.99" dur="5.97">about it and but there are making the</text>
  <text start="2164.779" dur="6.211">case that these attacks have come from</text>
  <text start="2167.96" dur="6.24">someplace in the Eastern Europe the</text>
  <text start="2170.99" dur="4.619">eastern area at this time and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2174.2" dur="2.79">even believe you know what are they</text>
  <text start="2175.609" dur="3.48">trying to say is it North Korea Russia</text>
  <text start="2176.99" dur="3.78">China and it seems like that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2179.089" dur="3.921">they&amp;#39;re pointing to right this time at</text>
  <text start="2180.77" dur="5.46">this time and they&amp;#39;re saying back in</text>
  <text start="2183.01" dur="5.89">November they there were a series of</text>
  <text start="2186.23" dur="5.879">trial hacks that were made and took</text>
  <text start="2188.9" dur="5.73">place and this was the staging for the</text>
  <text start="2192.109" dur="3.92">December hacks and we can see they are</text>
  <text start="2194.63" dur="3.989">definitely building their case and</text>
  <text start="2196.029" dur="5.32">saturday i said they were building this</text>
  <text start="2198.619" dur="5.371">up because we understand that sis but is</text>
  <text start="2201.349" dur="4.44">pending in the Senate and they want this</text>
  <text start="2203.99" dur="4.23">pass and they they can definitely make a</text>
  <text start="2205.789" dur="5.28">case right now saying listen we need to</text>
  <text start="2208.22" dur="5.25">start sharing information with all these</text>
  <text start="2211.069" dur="4.561">corporations because all this data is</text>
  <text start="2213.47" dur="4.23">coming in much much later and if we have</text>
  <text start="2215.63" dur="3.84">the ability to share all this and take</text>
  <text start="2217.7" dur="3.839">control the internet it would be much</text>
  <text start="2219.47" dur="4.859">easier for this for us to take you know</text>
  <text start="2221.539" dur="4.921">to have control and to stop whatever is</text>
  <text start="2224.329" dur="4.26">going on it&amp;#39;s the same case about the</text>
  <text start="2226.46" dur="3.629">NSA spying on the people you know if we</text>
  <text start="2228.589" dur="3.331">had control of spying on every single</text>
  <text start="2230.089" dur="3.361">person we can stop these terrorists</text>
  <text start="2231.92" dur="3.03">attacks and of course they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="2233.45" dur="3.69">who actually do the terrorist attacks</text>
  <text start="2234.95" dur="4.71">though there&amp;#39;s nothing to stop now we</text>
  <text start="2237.14" dur="5.07">understand and I&amp;#39;ve talked about this</text>
  <text start="2239.66" dur="4.439">quite often that eventually we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2242.21" dur="4.109">to have the doomsday cyber attack and</text>
  <text start="2244.099" dur="3.421">that is going to hit the power grid that</text>
  <text start="2246.319" dur="3.631">is going to hit the financial</text>
  <text start="2247.52" dur="5.97">institution that is going to bring the</text>
  <text start="2249.95" dur="5.97">country to its knees and we can see and</text>
  <text start="2253.49" dur="5.819">what&amp;#39;s strange about this is that there</text>
  <text start="2255.92" dur="5.81">was a nother freak algo halted bond</text>
  <text start="2259.309" dur="5.851">trading for five seconds during Friday</text>

  <text start="2266.779" dur="6.681">know happened and this is what it says</text>
  <text start="2269.66" dur="6.02">on january 10th 2013</text>
  <text start="2273.46" dur="3.69">tenth of a second before the Labor</text>
  <text start="2275.68" dur="4.14">Department released the widely</text>
  <text start="2277.15" dur="5.939">anticipated employment situation report</text>
  <text start="2279.82" dur="5.97">trading activity exploded in Treasury</text>

  <text start="2302.95" dur="5.04">the news was officially released in</text>
  <text start="2305.05" dur="4.92">Washington DC meaning that anyone wanted</text>
  <text start="2307.99" dur="4.2">the trade on the news would have to wait</text>
  <text start="2309.97" dur="5.55">until the halt was lifted almost four</text>
  <text start="2312.19" dur="4.77">seconds later and this isn&amp;#39;t the first</text>
  <text start="2315.52" dur="3.75">time that the Treasury features have</text>
  <text start="2316.96" dur="5.49">been halted it was happen in november</text>
  <text start="2319.27" dur="5.55">eighth of 2013 it also happened in june</text>
  <text start="2322.45" dur="5.76">seventh of 2013 but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2324.82" dur="10.35">interesting about this is that before</text>
  <text start="2328.21" dur="9.78">june of 2013 this didn&amp;#39;t happen it was</text>
  <text start="2335.17" dur="4.98">very very rare and you didn&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="2337.99" dur="6.66">happen and now you&amp;#39;re seeing it more</text>
  <text start="2340.15" dur="9.84">often and this is telling us that there</text>
  <text start="2344.65" dur="8.31">is definitely something going on now I</text>
  <text start="2349.99" dur="6.93">thought it was interesting the way Obama</text>
  <text start="2352.96" dur="6.659">came out and he&amp;#39;s saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2356.92" dur="5.34">calling this a year of action now I</text>
  <text start="2359.619" dur="4.951">remember when he was campaigning to be</text>
  <text start="2362.26" dur="4.29">elected and he was saying change and of</text>
  <text start="2364.57" dur="4.65">course this is not the change that</text>
  <text start="2366.55" dur="8.37">everyone envisioned unemployment close</text>
  <text start="2369.22" dur="10.41">to thirty percent the the debt over 17</text>
  <text start="2374.92" dur="7.02">trillion it just you know we&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="2379.63" dur="6.63">more wars across the world than we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2381.94" dur="6.06">ever had and this I don&amp;#39;t believe is the</text>
  <text start="2386.26" dur="4.56">change that everyone was believing and</text>
  <text start="2388" dur="4.67">now when he says the year of action this</text>
  <text start="2390.82" dur="4.769">kind of makes me a little nervous</text>
  <text start="2392.67" dur="4.689">because everyone must think in their</text>
  <text start="2395.589" dur="3.631">minds of course because were brainwashed</text>
  <text start="2397.359" dur="4.561">to think this way year of action means</text>
  <text start="2399.22" dur="6.27">it&amp;#39;s good for the country in my mind</text>
  <text start="2401.92" dur="5.94">year of action means a collapse</text>
  <text start="2405.49" dur="6">DHS taking over every single law</text>
  <text start="2407.86" dur="6.72">enforcement people being rounded up</text>
  <text start="2411.49" dur="5.28">because this is the year of action but</text>
  <text start="2414.58" dur="5.7">he goes on to say I&amp;#39;ll keep doing</text>
  <text start="2416.77" dur="5.76">everything I can to create a to create</text>
  <text start="2420.28" dur="5.339">new jobs and new opportunities for</text>
  <text start="2422.53" dur="5.79">American families with Congress or on my</text>
  <text start="2425.619" dur="5.641">own and with everyone willing to play</text>
  <text start="2428.32" dur="6.06">their part and that&amp;#39;s kind of nervous</text>
  <text start="2431.26" dur="6.12">because he really needs Congress he</text>
  <text start="2434.38" dur="6.15">can&amp;#39;t do anything on his own he&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="2437.38" dur="5.79">executive branch he takes orders he</text>
  <text start="2440.53" dur="5.46">doesn&amp;#39;t tell you what to do he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2443.17" dur="5.72">tell Congress what to do but this also</text>
  <text start="2445.99" dur="6.27">goes on to say and this goes further is</text>
  <text start="2448.89" dur="6.1">that you know he wants to mobilize the</text>
  <text start="2452.26" dur="6.03">country around the national mission of</text>
  <text start="2454.99" dur="7.29">making sure our economy offers everyone</text>
  <text start="2458.29" dur="7.41">who works hard so everyone who works</text>
  <text start="2462.28" dur="8.01">hard a fair shot at opportunity and</text>
  <text start="2465.7" dur="9.419">success what does that mean that</text>
  <text start="2470.29" dur="7.59">everyone who works hard working folks</text>
  <text start="2475.119" dur="5.131">are looking for the kind of stable</text>
  <text start="2477.88" dur="5.61">secure jobs that went overseas in the</text>
  <text start="2480.25" dur="7.23">past couple decades and I will make sure</text>
  <text start="2483.49" dur="7.05">that everyone has this type of working</text>
  <text start="2487.48" dur="5.1">that will have new jobs will have a</text>
  <text start="2490.54" dur="4.71">Grodin growing middle class he sounds</text>
  <text start="2492.58" dur="5.19">like a dictator to me business owners</text>
  <text start="2495.25" dur="6.03">are ready to play their part and hire</text>
  <text start="2497.77" dur="6.15">more workers really business owners are</text>
  <text start="2501.28" dur="3.87">ready to hire more people well what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2503.92" dur="3.66">been saying is that they&amp;#39;ve been laying</text>
  <text start="2505.15" dur="6.12">off thousands of people if that is the</text>
  <text start="2507.58" dur="5.85">case why do we have unemployment the</text>
  <text start="2511.27" dur="3.75">amount of people that have fallen off</text>
