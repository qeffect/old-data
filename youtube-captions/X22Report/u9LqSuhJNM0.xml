  <text start="301.819" dur="6.75">putting the Betsy Ross flag on their</text>
  <text start="304.31" dur="7.53">weapons and Kaepernick posted an</text>
  <text start="308.569" dur="6.87">out-of-context Frederick Douglass quote</text>
  <text start="311.84" dur="7.68">on Twitter for Independence Day he said</text>
  <text start="315.439" dur="7.35">the following what I have I or those I</text>
  <text start="319.52" dur="5.34">represent to do with our national</text>
  <text start="322.789" dur="3.391">independence this fourth of July is</text>
  <text start="324.86" dur="3.45">yours not mine</text>
  <text start="326.18" dur="4.979">there is not a nation on the earth</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="4.859">guilty of practices more shocking and</text>
  <text start="331.159" dur="4.07">bloody than are the people of these</text>
  <text start="333.169" dur="7.11">United States at this very hour</text>
  <text start="335.229" dur="8.831">Frederick Douglass however remember</text>
  <text start="340.279" dur="6.871">context is key and he took this one</text>
  <text start="344.06" dur="6.87">sentence and it&amp;#39;s completely out of</text>
  <text start="347.15" dur="6.949">context so Ted Cruz decided you know</text>
  <text start="350.93" dur="6.479">something I&amp;#39;m going to set him straight</text>
  <text start="354.099" dur="5.35">Ted Cruz tweeted out the following in</text>
  <text start="357.409" dur="4.111">response to what Kaepernick said you</text>
  <text start="359.449" dur="4.051">quote a mighty and historic speech by</text>
  <text start="361.52" dur="5.04">the great abolish NIST Frederick</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="5.939">Douglass but without context many modern</text>
  <text start="366.56" dur="7.68">readers will misunderstand - two</text>
  <text start="369.439" dur="7.35">critical points number one this speech</text>
  <text start="374.24" dur="5.19">was given in 1852 before the Civil War</text>
  <text start="376.789" dur="3.541">when the abomination of slavery still</text>
  <text start="379.43" dur="3.06">existed</text>
  <text start="380.33" dur="5.04">thanks to Douglass and so many other</text>
  <text start="382.49" dur="4.739">heroes we ended that grotesque evil and</text>
  <text start="385.37" dur="4.699">have made enormous strides to protect</text>
  <text start="387.229" dur="6.36">the civil rights of everybody number two</text>
  <text start="390.069" dur="6.07">Douglass was not anti-american he was</text>
  <text start="393.589" dur="5.341">rightly and passionately anti-slavery</text>
  <text start="396.139" dur="5.18">indeed he included the speech as follows</text>
  <text start="398.93" dur="5.43">allow me to say in conclusion</text>
  <text start="401.319" dur="5.261">notwithstanding the dark picture I have</text>
  <text start="404.36" dur="5.369">this day presented of the state of the</text>
  <text start="406.58" dur="6.569">nation I do not despair of this country</text>
  <text start="409.729" dur="6.271">there are forces in operation which must</text>
  <text start="413.149" dur="5.281">inevitably work the downfall of slavery</text>
  <text start="416" dur="5.27">the arm of the Lord is not shortened and</text>
  <text start="418.43" dur="5.88">the doom of slavery is certain I</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="5.53">therefore leave off where I began with</text>
  <text start="424.31" dur="4.18">hope while drawing encouragement from</text>
  <text start="426.8" dur="4.36">the Declaration of Independence</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="5.16">the great principals it contains and the</text>
  <text start="431.16" dur="5.28">genius of American institutions my</text>
  <text start="433.65" dur="5.25">spirit is also cheered by the obvious</text>
  <text start="436.44" dur="5.759">tendency of the age and Ted Cruz</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="5.9">continued let me encourage everyone read</text>
  <text start="442.199" dur="5.431">the entire speech it is powerful</text>
  <text start="444.8" dur="4.72">inspirational historically important in</text>
  <text start="447.63" dur="4.89">bending the arc of history toward</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="6.36">justice and Kaepernick took this</text>
  <text start="452.52" dur="7.23">completely out of context to try to fit</text>
  <text start="455.88" dur="7.19">his agenda Douglass even referred to the</text>
  <text start="459.75" dur="6.96">Constitution as a glorious Liberty</text>
  <text start="463.07" dur="7.39">document read its preamble consider its</text>
  <text start="466.71" dur="6.299">purpose is slavery among them is it at</text>
  <text start="470.46" dur="6.84">the gateway or is it in the temple it is</text>
  <text start="473.009" dur="6.75">neither he said he continued well I do</text>
  <text start="477.3" dur="5.67">not intend to argue this question on the</text>
  <text start="479.759" dur="5.071">present occasion let me ask if it be not</text>
  <text start="482.97" dur="4.439">somewhat singler that if the</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="4.8">Constitution were intended to be by its</text>
  <text start="487.409" dur="4.26">framers and adopters a slaveholding</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="4.529">instrument why neither slavery</text>
  <text start="491.669" dur="5.521">slaveholding nor slave can anywhere be</text>
  <text start="494.159" dur="4.681">found in it it should be abundantly</text>
  <text start="497.19" dur="4.89">clear to the reader that Douglass</text>
  <text start="498.84" dur="5.49">opposed slavery but had hope that</text>
  <text start="502.08" dur="6.869">America of all countries could write the</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="6.769">wrong his hope was not misplaced now</text>
  <text start="508.949" dur="7.231">something very interesting with kappanna</text>
  <text start="511.099" dur="8.951">because he raised $20,000 in celebrity</text>
  <text start="516.18" dur="8.64">donations for a group honoring a</text>
  <text start="520.05" dur="7.82">convicted cop killer now this is very</text>
  <text start="524.82" dur="8.43">interesting and you know this individual</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="9.159">who&amp;#39;s a former quarterback he is on the</text>
  <text start="533.25" dur="7.98">payroll of those who are trying to push</text>
  <text start="537.029" dur="7.141">an agenda and this is why he&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="541.23" dur="6.21">outspoken this is why he&amp;#39;s pushing this</text>
  <text start="544.17" dur="6.96">so hard he&amp;#39;s making millions and</text>
  <text start="547.44" dur="6.269">millions of dollars here in the United</text>
  <text start="551.13" dur="6.06">States a little bit of a contradiction</text>
  <text start="553.709" dur="5.82">of what he is doing right now now very</text>
  <text start="557.19" dur="4.86">interestingly Trump is considering an</text>
