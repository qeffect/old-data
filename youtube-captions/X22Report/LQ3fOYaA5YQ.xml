  <text start="85.36" dur="6.09">news now going all the way back to when</text>
  <text start="88.33" dur="5.46">Trump was elected president we talked</text>
  <text start="91.45" dur="4.26">about how he had to control the</text>
  <text start="93.79" dur="4.02">narrative and there was a battle going</text>
  <text start="95.71" dur="4.17">on between a central body in the deep</text>
  <text start="97.81" dur="4.32">state where they were both trying to</text>
  <text start="99.88" dur="4.89">control the narrative of how the economy</text>
  <text start="102.13" dur="5.58">was doing now and the beginning when</text>
  <text start="104.77" dur="5.4">Trump first came into office the central</text>
  <text start="107.71" dur="6.33">bank had control or deep state had</text>
  <text start="110.17" dur="7.76">control and they used this control to</text>
  <text start="114.04" dur="6.66">push their agenda and as time went on</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="4.39">they were continually pushing their</text>
  <text start="120.7" dur="4.529">agenda thinking that they still had</text>
  <text start="122.32" dur="6.09">control where they thought okay after</text>
  <text start="125.229" dur="5.601">Trump was in office for a year we will</text>
  <text start="128.41" dur="5.16">then start to bring down the economy and</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="5.53">everything that he was doing we&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="133.57" dur="3.389">blame it on him while everything has</text>
  <text start="136.36" dur="3.75">changed</text>
  <text start="136.959" dur="5.521">the central bank no longer is in control</text>
  <text start="140.11" dur="4.68">they are not controlling the narrative</text>
  <text start="142.48" dur="4.47">the deep state they are no longer in</text>
  <text start="144.79" dur="3.69">control they&amp;#39;re not controlling the</text>
  <text start="146.95" dur="4.17">narrative we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about</text>
  <text start="148.48" dur="6.56">that in just a bit and why everything</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="7.05">has changed and why Trump has done it</text>
  <text start="155.04" dur="5.35">but first I want to go out to what is</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="3.63">happening out in the UK and we</text>
  <text start="160.39" dur="3.83">understand that this brexit deal is</text>
  <text start="161.8" dur="3.66">absolutely awful it is terrible and</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="2.92">everyone saw</text>
  <text start="165.46" dur="3.66">to get wind of this and they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="167.14" dur="5.04">to see that yeah it&amp;#39;s weighted towards</text>
  <text start="169.12" dur="4.95">the EU this was not a brexit deal it was</text>
  <text start="172.18" dur="5.55">basically the same exact thing that they</text>
  <text start="174.07" dur="8.18">had but a lot worse and we know this for</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="9.78">a fact because May tried to hide certain</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="7">pages from the brexit people so they</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="3.78">wouldn&amp;#39;t understand the analysis of it</text>
  <text start="189.25" dur="2.97">so they wouldn&amp;#39;t understand what was</text>
  <text start="191.29" dur="3.9">really going on</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="5.97">we even have former US Secretary of</text>
  <text start="195.19" dur="5.01">State out there John Kerry he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="198.19" dur="6.6">Northern Ireland and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="200.2" dur="8.49">the people should accept this deal or</text>
  <text start="204.79" dur="7.92">it&amp;#39;s going to reignite terror in the</text>
  <text start="208.69" dur="6.27">region now of course we know that Kerry</text>
  <text start="212.71" dur="3.54">is part of the deep state he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="214.96" dur="4.23">looking out for the best interests of</text>
  <text start="216.25" dur="5.4">the people first of all you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="219.19" dur="4.8">to tell people to accept something if</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s very good if something is already</text>
  <text start="223.99" dur="3.03">good and people read it and they say oh</text>
  <text start="225.49" dur="3.9">yeah you know what this works for us</text>
  <text start="227.02" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;ll just accept it because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="229.39" dur="5.31">great for them when you force someone to</text>
  <text start="232.45" dur="5.31">take it and tell them that this is good</text>
  <text start="234.7" dur="5.97">or something bad will happen that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="4.05">you know it&amp;#39;s not good and this is what</text>
  <text start="240.67" dur="4.53">the deep State has been doing for a very</text>
  <text start="241.81" dur="5.55">long time they continually push their</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="4.86">agenda by telling you listen if you</text>
  <text start="247.36" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t do this well we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="250.06" dur="4.29">terror we&amp;#39;re gonna see a collapse we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.34" dur="6.06">gonna see something else happen and they</text>
  <text start="254.35" dur="6.05">use this for many many many years but</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="5.52">everything&amp;#39;s changing right now and</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="6.43">Trump the Patriots they are in complete</text>
  <text start="263.92" dur="6.78">control control over what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="266.83" dur="7.92">the narrative now the economy is falling</text>
  <text start="270.7" dur="7.08">apart why because they&amp;#39;re pushing it to</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="5.67">the edge this is not by accident this is</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="4.05">not the central bank doing it well it is</text>
  <text start="280.42" dur="3.12">the central bank doing it but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="281.83" dur="3.84">under the control of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="283.54" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re telling them what to do actually</text>
  <text start="285.67" dur="5.34">Putin took control of his private</text>
  <text start="288.88" dur="5.039">western central bank and now he dictates</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="4.83">to the central bank that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.919" dur="4.211">happening right now Trump I do believe</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="5.14">has the Inside Man</text>
  <text start="298.13" dur="4.68">and he&amp;#39;s continually doing what he wants</text>
  <text start="300.98" dur="4.28">he can tell Powell to raise the interest</text>
  <text start="302.81" dur="5.7">rates he can tell them to freeze them</text>
  <text start="305.26" dur="5.95">but we know that this is all being done</text>
  <text start="308.51" dur="4.22">on purpose and as we move forward here</text>
  <text start="311.21" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re going to see the economy</text>
  <text start="312.73" dur="3.94">completely rip itself apart now we</text>
  <text start="314.78" dur="3.78">talked about raising interest rates for</text>
  <text start="316.67" dur="3.75">a very long time we know when the rates</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="4.32">go up everything starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="320.42" dur="4.95">remember this entire economy was built</text>
  <text start="322.88" dur="6.09">on a central bank deep state illusion</text>
  <text start="325.37" dur="7.26">and we&amp;#39;re getting evidence that it is</text>
  <text start="328.97" dur="5.1">falling apart very very rapidly now as</text>
  <text start="332.63" dur="3.3">the interest rates continually move up</text>
  <text start="334.07" dur="4.53">what do we see happening we see real</text>
  <text start="335.93" dur="5.37">estate well it&amp;#39;s starting to implode on</text>
  <text start="338.6" dur="5.36">itself Toll Brothers right now announced</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="7.83">that its fourth quarter results are</text>
  <text start="343.96" dur="8.8">absolutely terrible orders are now down</text>
  <text start="349.13" dur="9.33">thirteen percent from a year ago they</text>
  <text start="352.76" dur="7.92">were expecting their estimates to be up</text>
  <text start="358.46" dur="4.14">by five percent but they&amp;#39;re down by 13</text>
  <text start="360.68" dur="4.89">percent and they&amp;#39;re blaming this on the</text>
  <text start="362.6" dur="4.29">interest rates of course because when</text>
  <text start="365.57" dur="3.66">you raise the interest rates what does</text>
  <text start="366.89" dur="4.65">it do it bums a lot of people out of the</text>
  <text start="369.23" dur="3.99">market it makes it impossible for these</text>
  <text start="371.54" dur="3.45">individuals to purchase a home now</text>
  <text start="373.22" dur="3.87">remember two things were happening at</text>
  <text start="374.99" dur="3.45">once interest rates were coming down and</text>
  <text start="377.09" dur="4.71">prices were going up</text>
  <text start="378.44" dur="4.77">well prices are very high if you start</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="3.66">to raise interest rates what happens you</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="4.56">have high prices high interest rates you</text>
  <text start="385.46" dur="5.1">can&amp;#39;t purchase the home that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="387.77" dur="6.12">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and Toll Brothers</text>
  <text start="390.56" dur="4.65">they were focusing all their business a</text>
  <text start="393.89" dur="5.52">lot of their business I should say in</text>
  <text start="395.21" dur="8.24">California on high-end homes and orders</text>
  <text start="399.41" dur="8.19">for the state they&amp;#39;re down by 39 percent</text>
  <text start="403.45" dur="8.23">this is an absolute disaster but this is</text>
  <text start="407.6" dur="7.02">the entire plan this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="411.68" dur="4.8">been pushing now let&amp;#39;s think about all</text>
  <text start="414.62" dur="6.44">of this for a second and take a step</text>
  <text start="416.48" dur="7.8">back now the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="421.06" dur="6.49">they were going to use what Trump was</text>
  <text start="424.28" dur="6.12">doing with tariffs they tried to build a</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="4.049">narrative around this saying listen if</text>
  <text start="430.4" dur="4.199">Trump can</text>
  <text start="431.599" dur="5.46">you know pushes these tariffs he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="434.599" dur="5.011">slow down global growth and bring the</text>
  <text start="437.059" dur="4.89">economy down and they were gonna try to</text>
  <text start="439.61" dur="4.739">use this because he made the economy</text>
  <text start="441.949" dur="6.09">great now let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="444.349" dur="6.27">second when he came into office in 2016</text>
  <text start="448.039" dur="4.49">the economy was doing pretty much</text>
  <text start="450.619" dur="5.07">nothing he was built on an illusion</text>
  <text start="452.529" dur="4.961">Trump came in and they thought okay we</text>
  <text start="455.689" dur="4.95">know the economy&amp;#39;s built on the illusion</text>
  <text start="457.49" dur="5.879">he really can&amp;#39;t do anything with it well</text>
  <text start="460.639" dur="5.31">Trump took that of the illusion multiple</text>
  <text start="463.369" dur="3.75">multiplied it by five and then all of a</text>
  <text start="465.949" dur="4.351">sudden we saw the economy doing</text>
  <text start="467.119" dur="3.57">fantastically so they said okay wait a</text>
  <text start="470.3" dur="2.639">minute</text>
