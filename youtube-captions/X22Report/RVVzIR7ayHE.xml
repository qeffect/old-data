  <text start="473.04" dur="5.64">are going on and actually later in this</text>
  <text start="475.14" dur="7.64">report i broke down because what happens</text>
  <text start="478.68" dur="11.52">is the government does things very</text>
  <text start="482.78" dur="12.1">slowly just like if we go back to Nazi</text>
  <text start="490.2" dur="7.95">Germany back in the late 20s early 30s</text>
  <text start="494.88" dur="7.26">and then moving past you know the later</text>
  <text start="498.15" dur="10.07">30s to 40s but they enacted all</text>
  <text start="502.14" dur="8.91">different type of laws and and rules</text>
  <text start="508.22" dur="4.09">just like they&amp;#39;re doing today but it</text>
  <text start="511.05" dur="3.57">didn&amp;#39;t all happen in one so they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="512.31" dur="3.6">come out and say you know all the Jewish</text>
