  <text start="51.58" dur="5.36">let&amp;#39;s talk about I youth unemployment</text>
  <text start="53.77" dur="6.12">because the UN put out a report and</text>
  <text start="56.94" dur="5.02">they&amp;#39;re focusing in on youth</text>

  <text start="67.45" dur="7.49">and the youth to adult unemployment</text>

  <text start="140.38" dur="5.88">through the report what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="142.51" dur="6.75">saying is that the next generation they</text>

  <text start="309.64" dur="5.22">closely at it and it seems that</text>
  <text start="311.53" dur="7.74">everything is contained and we&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="314.86" dur="6.48">this before we&amp;#39;ve heard the Fed come out</text>
  <text start="319.27" dur="5.04">telling us that things are contained</text>
  <text start="321.34" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re taken care of and then what</text>

  <text start="413.2" dur="4.77">retail sales are not going as well the</text>
  <text start="416.14" dur="3.15">trucking industry is declining because</text>

  <text start="430.12" dur="5.49">to burst</text>
  <text start="431.8" dur="7.35">and the week of the 14th to the 18th</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="6.029">this week the Fed is going to make a</text>
  <text start="439.15" dur="4.889">decision should they raise interest</text>
  <text start="441.639" dur="7.191">rates or keep them at 0 or go to</text>
  <text start="444.039" dur="8.22">negative and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="448.83" dur="5.32">this week is going to shape up to be an</text>
  <text start="452.259" dur="6.421">absolutely critical week for global</text>

  <text start="466.539" dur="4.951">stocks really started to slide all over</text>
  <text start="469.449" dur="3.661">the world here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="471.49" dur="5.519">dow jones industrial average is down</text>

  <text start="478.81" dur="4.8">from the peak of the market so what does</text>
  <text start="481.389" dur="5.34">the Fed do did they leave them at zero</text>
  <text start="483.61" dur="6.299">percent maybe go to negative well if</text>
  <text start="486.729" dur="4.921">they do that guess what the world will</text>
  <text start="489.909" dur="5.421">look at the Fed they will lose</text>
  <text start="491.65" dur="6.919">credibility after seven years</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="5.32">unemployment approaching full recovery</text>
  <text start="498.569" dur="5.081">telling us that the economy has</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="5.91">recovered they&amp;#39;re leaving the in trace</text>
  <text start="503.65" dur="6.21">interest rates at zero or going negative</text>
  <text start="506.56" dur="7.529">which shows the economy really hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="8.609">improved whatsoever or do they have the</text>
  <text start="514.089" dur="6.39">event ready to go if they do they will</text>
  <text start="518.469" dur="4.26">raise the interest rates now they can do</text>
  <text start="520.479" dur="5.36">this in two different ways they can</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="7.17">raise it by a small percentage point</text>
  <text start="525.839" dur="7.06">this will signal everyone that okay the</text>
  <text start="529.899" dur="5.911">event is ready to go they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="532.899" dur="7.201">bring down the economy and they need to</text>
  <text start="535.81" dur="8.43">show the world first that everything</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;ve done worked and when they do</text>
  <text start="544.24" dur="4.289">this they can say see we raise the</text>
  <text start="546.25" dur="4.8">interest rates everything is fine the</text>
  <text start="548.529" dur="4.861">system did not collapse we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="4.529">raise them once again and now during</text>
  <text start="553.39" dur="4.65">this period of raising the interest</text>
  <text start="555.579" dur="4.831">rates this is when they will bring down</text>
  <text start="558.04" dur="5.25">the economy or they might have the event</text>
  <text start="560.41" dur="4.9">all ready to go they might already get</text>
  <text start="563.29" dur="4.39">the might already have the green light</text>
  <text start="565.31" dur="5.6">and they might just go all out and say</text>
  <text start="567.68" dur="7.32">okay we&amp;#39;re going half a percentage and</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="5.2">as they&amp;#39;re doing this the event occurs</text>
  <text start="575" dur="4.25">so we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this</text>
  <text start="576.11" dur="6.36">situation very very carefully but a</text>
  <text start="579.25" dur="6.19">perfect storm at this point is brewing</text>
  <text start="582.47" dur="5.67">and this week could potentially be one</text>
  <text start="585.44" dur="5.28">of the most chaotic that we&amp;#39;ve seen in a</text>
  <text start="588.14" dur="5.12">very long time so we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="590.72" dur="5.85">watch the Fed and see where this goes</text>
  <text start="593.26" dur="4.9">China right now the ICBC is going to</text>

  <text start="615.2" dur="5.37">dollars right now and we can see that</text>
  <text start="618.41" dur="4.92">everything at this point is shifting</text>
  <text start="620.57" dur="4.35">from the west to the east United States</text>
  <text start="623.33" dur="3.09">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
