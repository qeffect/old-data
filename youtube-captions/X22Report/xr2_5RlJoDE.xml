  <text start="181.139" dur="4.171">their own currencies completely</text>
  <text start="183.299" dur="5.131">bypassing the dollar at this time and</text>
  <text start="185.31" dur="5.609">this is a continuing trend which is not</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="5.25">stopping here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="190.919" dur="5.011">understand the central bankers and the</text>
  <text start="193.68" dur="4.5">US government they are pushing common</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="4.44">coordinate as we know they always put</text>
  <text start="198.18" dur="4.559">fantastic titles on two bills that</text>
  <text start="200.37" dur="4.619">become laws like the Affordable Care Act</text>
  <text start="202.739" dur="4.86">the Patriot Act and this is Common Core</text>
  <text start="204.989" dur="5.22">and it sounds fantastic the common core</text>
  <text start="207.599" dur="5.07">the core the foundation of Education but</text>
  <text start="210.209" dur="4.05">as we can see this is not the fact</text>
  <text start="212.669" dur="3.69">whatsoever basically what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="214.259" dur="3.991">is you&amp;#39;re using federal funds trying to</text>
  <text start="216.359" dur="3.361">bribe the states and taking this on of</text>
  <text start="218.25" dur="3.599">course most of the states have now</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re starting to realize this might</text>
  <text start="221.849" dur="4.23">have been a mistake where our children</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="5.729">are not really being educated basically</text>
  <text start="226.079" dur="6.24">what this is is a hewn huge brainwashing</text>
  <text start="229.349" dur="4.681">type of education system to make the</text>
  <text start="232.319" dur="3.42">children believe that the government is</text>
  <text start="234.03" dur="3.599">in control of everything that government</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="4.08">gives the people their rights the</text>
  <text start="237.629" dur="4.14">government can take away their rights</text>
  <text start="239.819" dur="4.95">and we can see right now from the way</text>
  <text start="241.769" dur="5.761">the education system system is going it</text>
  <text start="244.769" dur="4.56">is basically just a dumb down the next</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="3.51">generation a lot of states are taking a</text>
  <text start="249.329" dur="3.06">look at this and saying maybe we</text>
  <text start="251.04" dur="3.509">shouldn&amp;#39;t have this and we should not</text>
  <text start="252.389" dur="3.511">implement this in our state&amp;#39;s and a lot</text>
  <text start="254.549" dur="3.15">of parents are looking at this saying</text>
  <text start="255.9" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re going to take them out of public</text>
  <text start="257.699" dur="4.141">school until this is absolutely removed</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="3.96">more parents or removing their children</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="3.93">from traditional school environments and</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="4.079">are choosing to homeschool them instead</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="4.139">due to increased concern over the use of</text>
  <text start="267.599" dur="3.781">common core standards North Carolina</text>
  <text start="269.909" dur="3.681">homeschooling increased by fourteen</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="4.1">percent we&amp;#39;re also seeing an increase in</text>
  <text start="273.59" dur="3.75">percentage in Virginia California and</text>
  <text start="275.48" dur="3.45">New York and it&amp;#39;s starting to spread</text>
  <text start="277.34" dur="4.98">across the country in a lot of states</text>
  <text start="278.93" dur="5.46">right now are introducing bills to</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="4.35">repeal Common Core because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.39" dur="4.59">starting to realize that this is not</text>
  <text start="286.67" dur="5.4">good for the next generation of our</text>
  <text start="288.98" dur="5.88">youth and it is definitely not now we</text>
  <text start="292.07" dur="5.19">understand President Obama definitely</text>
  <text start="294.86" dur="4.77">has an agenda with these illegals coming</text>
  <text start="297.26" dur="4.32">over the border and we can see one part</text>
  <text start="299.63" dur="3.12">of it is to try to get them on Obamacare</text>
  <text start="301.58" dur="3.21">but they&amp;#39;re having a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="3.48">problem with this because of the mandate</text>
  <text start="304.79" dur="4.02">but now if things are starting to become</text>
  <text start="306.23" dur="4.83">a little bit more clear and what is</text>
  <text start="308.81" dur="3.9">going on here those who have received</text>
  <text start="311.06" dur="4.26">amnesty will not be eligible for</text>
  <text start="312.71" dur="4.98">Obamacare at this time those workers</text>
  <text start="315.32" dur="4.92">won&amp;#39;t count against business employee</text>
  <text start="317.69" dur="5.55">total that trigger employee mandate</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="5.22">penalties making illegal immigrants much</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="4.41">more attractive than either native-born</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="4.13">Americans or legal immigrants who are</text>
  <text start="327.65" dur="4.17">eligible for Obamacare coverage</text>
  <text start="329.59" dur="4.3">Obamacare is employer mandate which will</text>
  <text start="331.82" dur="3.93">partially take effect in January require</text>
  <text start="333.89" dur="2.88">businesses with a certain number of</text>
  <text start="335.75" dur="4.02">full-time employees to provide</text>
  <text start="336.77" dur="5.04">affordable health coverage as defined by</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="4.14">the federal government or pay a 3,000</text>
  <text start="341.81" dur="4.05">per worker penalty for failing to do so</text>
  <text start="343.91" dur="4.2">so right now these illegals that are</text>
  <text start="345.86" dur="4.5">coming right over to the border and of</text>
  <text start="348.11" dur="7.5">course the President Obama has signed</text>
  <text start="350.36" dur="9.03">the executive order where the agencies</text>
  <text start="355.61" dur="6.45">the Department of Homeland Security the</text>
  <text start="359.39" dur="3.9">Border Patrol agents they cannot deport</text>
  <text start="362.06" dur="3.12">them so basically they are allowed to</text>
  <text start="363.29" dur="3.6">stay in the country they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="365.18" dur="4.17">legal citizens at this time there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.89" dur="4.65">still illegal immigrants they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="369.35" dur="4.05">have the ability to deport them they can</text>
  <text start="371.54" dur="4.59">get working permits right now under the</text>
  <text start="373.4" dur="4.59">executive order and they can sign up for</text>
  <text start="376.13" dur="5.19">health insurance but right now they</text>
  <text start="377.99" dur="6.84">cannot pretty much sign up for Obamacare</text>
  <text start="381.32" dur="5.85">at once they become legal citizens then</text>
  <text start="384.83" dur="6">yes they can so right now it looks like</text>
  <text start="387.17" dur="5.19">it is a plus for the corporations to</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="4.08">hire them because they don&amp;#39;t have to pay</text>
  <text start="392.36" dur="4.41">that $3,000 penalty so we can see how</text>
  <text start="394.91" dur="2.94">this is going to work more and more</text>
  <text start="396.77" dur="2.52">illegals are going to come over the</text>
  <text start="397.85" dur="4.77">border they&amp;#39;re going to get these jobs</text>
  <text start="399.29" dur="4.86">the corporation&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="402.62" dur="2.94">about shelling out the three thousand</text>
  <text start="404.15" dur="3.16">dollars and once these people become</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="3.61">legal citizens</text>
  <text start="407.31" dur="3.78">guess what they will be let go the next</text>
  <text start="409.17" dur="3.81">batch of illegals will come in and we</text>
  <text start="411.09" dur="4.5">can see this is how it&amp;#39;s going to work</text>
  <text start="412.98" dur="3.93">the corporation&amp;#39;s been affirmed benefit</text>
  <text start="415.59" dur="3.72">from this when they become legal</text>
  <text start="416.91" dur="3.63">citizens Obamacare benefits from this so</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="3.63">we can see this is going to be an</text>
  <text start="420.54" dur="5.15">ongoing trend and things are starting to</text>
  <text start="422.94" dur="7.2">get clearer and clearer as time goes on</text>
  <text start="425.69" dur="6.55">now there are Russian warships sitting</text>
  <text start="430.14" dur="3.45">in the English Channel four vessels</text>
  <text start="432.24" dur="3.78">which departed the Russian northern</text>
  <text start="433.59" dur="5.25">fleet main base on November 20th led by</text>
  <text start="436.02" dur="5.13">anti-submarine ships entered the english</text>
  <text start="438.84" dur="4.8">channel four exercises that include anti</text>
  <text start="441.15" dur="5.07">sabotage training damage control in case</text>
  <text start="443.64" dur="4.17">of fire and water intake Frances Navy</text>
  <text start="446.22" dur="3.6">confirmed that the location of the ships</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="5.04">and said it was not unusual to have</text>
  <text start="449.82" dur="4.92">Russian warships in the channel and it</text>
  <text start="452.85" dur="3.75">seems like they might be staying there</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="3.78">also because there are there is bad</text>
  <text start="456.6" dur="3.39">weather and they&amp;#39;re waiting for this to</text>
  <text start="458.52" dur="2.73">clear up so they might be sitting there</text>
  <text start="459.99" dur="3.45">of course NATO&amp;#39;s trying to make this</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="4.56">into a big deal that Russian warships</text>
  <text start="463.44" dur="4.35">are in the area and they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="465.81" dur="3.99">precautions and of course this is not</text>
  <text start="467.79" dur="4.32">the case whatsoever and they&amp;#39;ve made a</text>
  <text start="469.8" dur="4.82">lot of propaganda statements about</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="4.89">Russian planes all over the place and</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="5.32">almost ninety nine percent of the time</text>
  <text start="477" dur="4.68">they are in international airspace they</text>
  <text start="479.94" dur="3.63">do not fly into the air spate of the</text>
  <text start="481.68" dur="3.3">country&amp;#39;s NATO does this all the time</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="3.48">the United States does this all the time</text>
  <text start="484.98" dur="3.27">and many of the other countries do this</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="3.87">all the time but they&amp;#39;re making it a</text>
  <text start="488.25" dur="5.31">bigger deal to pretty much provoke</text>
  <text start="490.92" dur="5.58">provoke provoke and use the propaganda</text>
  <text start="493.56" dur="5.16">to make it look like Russia is invading</text>
  <text start="496.5" dur="5.94">all of these different areas or getting</text>
  <text start="498.72" dur="6.54">ready to invade these areas in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="502.44" dur="5.4">it seems like poroshenko has changed the</text>
  <text start="505.26" dur="4.08">laws once again Ukraine&amp;#39;s president has</text>
  <text start="507.84" dur="3.72">announced plans to change the nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.34" dur="5.01">legislation to make it possible to</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="5.79">appoint foreigners to top government</text>
  <text start="514.35" dur="5.61">positions how convenient this has been</text>
  <text start="517.35" dur="4.62">dubbed unprecedented and may indicate</text>
  <text start="519.96" dur="4.17">the country is being governed from the</text>
  <text start="521.97" dur="4.11">outside now of course what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.13" dur="3.39">trying to do is bring outside foreigners</text>
  <text start="526.08" dur="3.6">into the government just like they</text>
  <text start="527.52" dur="4.44">brought in paid mercenaries to help</text>
  <text start="529.68" dur="4.8">fight the southeastern people and</text>
  <text start="531.96" dur="4.95">eventually the people in Crimea and we</text>
  <text start="534.48" dur="3.84">can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="536.91" dur="3.96">government is being controlled by</text>
  <text start="538.32" dur="5.46">outside forces and more outside forces</text>
  <text start="540.87" dur="5.13">are coming into the area now in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="543.78" dur="5.31">their economy is completely falling</text>
  <text start="546" dur="6.75">apart inflation is basically the same as</text>
  <text start="549.09" dur="5.55">War warns one analyst it may lead to</text>
  <text start="552.75" dur="4.53">protest if people blame the authorities</text>
  <text start="554.64" dur="4.95">for failing to conduct proper policies</text>
  <text start="557.28" dur="5.18">and we can see right now their currency</text>
  <text start="559.59" dur="6.45">has plunged by forty-eight percent</text>
  <text start="562.46" dur="6.4">people are having a hard time purchasing</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="5.43">things inflation spite to nineteen point</text>
  <text start="568.86" dur="4.05">eight percent last month and we can see</text>
  <text start="571.47" dur="3.29">things are not getting better and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.91" dur="6.27">getting harder and harder for people to</text>
  <text start="574.76" dur="8.14">survive now it seems that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="579.18" dur="6.84">state in the city of muscle has decided</text>
  <text start="582.9" dur="6.3">to cut all mobile phone networks in that</text>
  <text start="586.02" dur="5.34">city to pretty much stop everyone from</text>
  <text start="589.2" dur="5.31">reporting what is really going on there</text>
  <text start="591.36" dur="4.98">and we can see they&amp;#39;re pushing their</text>
  <text start="594.51" dur="4.32">ability to spread out throughout these</text>
  <text start="596.34" dur="4.14">cities and we know the Iraqi forces are</text>
  <text start="598.83" dur="4.14">trying to maneuver their way into the</text>
  <text start="600.48" dur="4.31">city and we can see they&amp;#39;re just cutting</text>
  <text start="602.97" dur="4.41">down everything that&amp;#39;s been going on</text>
  <text start="604.79" dur="4.39">Syrian troops have captured several</text>
  <text start="607.38" dur="4.98">Islamic state positions in the city of</text>
  <text start="609.18" dur="4.74">Deir al-zor and basically the Syrian</text>
  <text start="612.36" dur="4.23">army managed to push large numbers of</text>
  <text start="613.92" dur="4.8">militants out of villages in Aleppo so</text>
  <text start="616.59" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re making great strides in Syria</text>
  <text start="618.72" dur="3.87">pushing the Islamic state back but of</text>
  <text start="621.06" dur="4.44">course the United States is out there</text>
  <text start="622.59" dur="6.87">NATO is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="625.5" dur="7.2">that oh these bombing runs the Syrian</text>
  <text start="629.46" dur="5.4">government they&amp;#39;re killing innocent</text>
  <text start="632.7" dur="5.7">civilians and look what they&amp;#39;re doing in</text>
  <text start="634.86" dur="6.24">these areas and Syria was out there and</text>
  <text start="638.4" dur="4.82">they&amp;#39;re completely rejecting and saying</text>
  <text start="641.1" dur="4.47">the United States is fabricating</text>
  <text start="643.22" dur="4.21">creating these accusations that their</text>
  <text start="645.57" dur="3.54">forces are targeting civilians which</text>
  <text start="647.43" dur="3.36">they are not and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="649.11" dur="4.23">the Coalition has been flying missions</text>
  <text start="650.79" dur="6.51">in Syria and in Iraq and they have been</text>
  <text start="653.34" dur="5.91">killing to hunt and of course as we know</text>
  <text start="657.3" dur="4.02">the United States government it really</text>
  <text start="659.25" dur="3.6">doesn&amp;#39;t matter they&amp;#39;re hitting the</text>
  <text start="661.32" dur="3.96">infrastructure if there are civilians</text>
  <text start="662.85" dur="4.02">there so be it they&amp;#39;re dead look what</text>
  <text start="665.28" dur="5.07">happens when they use drone strikes in</text>
  <text start="666.87" dur="5.85">yemen in leben lebanon in libya and pack</text>
  <text start="670.35" dur="4.35">Stan they hit an apartment building</text>
  <text start="672.72" dur="4.41">there might be two terrorists and the</text>
  <text start="674.7" dur="5.1">other 50 might be innocent civilians and</text>
  <text start="677.13" dur="5.61">lately the US government has been paying</text>
  <text start="679.8" dur="5.28">out for killing innocent civilians so</text>
  <text start="682.74" dur="4.62">right now the US government is trying to</text>
  <text start="685.08" dur="4.29">gin up this argument that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="687.36" dur="4.68">government is just flying these missions</text>
  <text start="689.37" dur="5.88">and just targeting civilians and again</text>
  <text start="692.04" dur="5.4">as of right now the Coalition has killed</text>
  <text start="695.25" dur="3.93">more civilians than the Syrian</text>
  <text start="697.44" dur="4.14">government the US state department said</text>
  <text start="699.18" dur="4.68">wednesday it was horrified by Syrian</text>
  <text start="701.58" dur="4.08">government bombings in rocca province</text>
  <text start="703.86" dur="3.93">which is said had killed dozens of</text>
  <text start="705.66" dur="4.08">civilians and demolished residential</text>
  <text start="707.79" dur="4.02">areas and if you look at the coalition</text>
  <text start="709.74" dur="4.02">they have killed over hundreds of</text>
  <text start="711.81" dur="4.32">civilians at this point in time and</text>
  <text start="713.76" dur="4.65">destroyed their main infrastructure so</text>
  <text start="716.13" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re just trying to use this again to</text>
  <text start="718.41" dur="4.68">demonize the Syrian government because</text>
  <text start="720.69" dur="4.32">the you as we know their main mission is</text>
  <text start="723.09" dur="4.59">to get Assad and that&amp;#39;s where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="725.01" dur="6.41">trying to do right now now it seems like</text>
  <text start="727.68" dur="7.47">the western-backed death squads</text>
  <text start="731.42" dur="5.74">basically in Syria are receiving a</text>
  <text start="735.15" dur="4.32">portion of their training inside guitar</text>
  <text start="737.16" dur="4.2">via the Qatari government and the United</text>
  <text start="739.47" dur="3.96">States and we know this the training</text>
  <text start="741.36" dur="3.84">bases in Jordan the training bases in</text>
  <text start="743.43" dur="4.17">Saudi Arabia the training bases in</text>
  <text start="745.2" dur="3.87">guitar all these people are being</text>
  <text start="747.6" dur="5.28">trained there by the United States</text>
  <text start="749.07" dur="5.84">Israel UK and Arab nations and they make</text>
  <text start="752.88" dur="4.98">up the Islamic state Syrian rebel</text>
  <text start="754.91" dur="4.48">sources have reported to the news agency</text>
  <text start="757.86" dur="3.09">that many of the fighters trained at</text>
  <text start="759.39" dur="4.47">guitar belonged to the Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="760.95" dur="5.34">an umbrella group for of death squad</text>
  <text start="763.86" dur="4.08">fanatics passed off as moderate by</text>
  <text start="766.29" dur="4.11">Western governments of course the</text>
  <text start="767.94" dur="3.9">reality is that there is no discernible</text>
  <text start="770.4" dur="3.6">difference between the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="771.84" dur="3.96">Free Syrian Army and other militant</text>
  <text start="774" dur="4.02">rebel group operating against the</text>
  <text start="775.8" dur="4.98">government of Assad and we know this for</text>
  <text start="778.02" dur="4.5">a fact they had to separate this because</text>
  <text start="780.78" dur="3.75">people were complaining that wait a</text>
  <text start="782.52" dur="4.5">minute we&amp;#39;re giving arms to the al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="784.53" dur="3.48">part of the Free Syrian Army and this is</text>
  <text start="787.02" dur="2.85">when the government United Sates</text>
  <text start="788.01" dur="3.21">government came outside oh no these are</text>
  <text start="789.87" dur="3.03">moderate people and these are the</text>
  <text start="791.22" dur="3.87">terrorists we&amp;#39;re not we&amp;#39;re not funding</text>
  <text start="792.9" dur="4.92">them we&amp;#39;re not giving them arms but in</text>
  <text start="795.09" dur="4.5">reality the Islamic state al-qaeda the</text>
  <text start="797.82" dur="4.23">Free Syrian Army they&amp;#39;re all paid</text>
  <text start="799.59" dur="4.59">mercenaries they&amp;#39;re all there for one</text>
  <text start="802.05" dur="4.8">purpose and one purpose only</text>
  <text start="804.18" dur="5.19">get Assad now the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="806.85" dur="5.13">supplied not by black market oil or</text>
  <text start="809.37" dur="5.04">hostage ransoms but by billions of</text>
  <text start="811.98" dur="4.91">dollars worth of supplies carried into</text>
  <text start="814.41" dur="5.67">Syria across NATO member turkey borders</text>
  <text start="816.89" dur="6.25">via hundreds of trucks a day the report</text>
  <text start="820.08" dur="6.15">titled the Islamic state supply channels</text>
  <text start="823.14" dur="5.34">through Turkey confirms what has been</text>
  <text start="826.23" dur="4.47">reported by Jill political analyst sins</text>
  <text start="828.48" dur="4.35">at least twenty eleven that NATO member</text>
  <text start="830.7" dur="3.87">Turkey has allowed a torrent and</text>
  <text start="832.83" dur="4.92">supplies fighters and weapons to cross</text>
  <text start="834.57" dur="5.43">its borders unopposed to Rio to resupply</text>
  <text start="837.75" dur="4.83">the Islamic state positions inside of</text>
  <text start="840" dur="5.82">Syria so basically what is happening all</text>
  <text start="842.58" dur="5.43">this that talk about their using the oil</text>
  <text start="845.82" dur="5.459">they&amp;#39;re bringing in billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="848.01" dur="4.59">and all these ransom payments that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="851.279" dur="3.741">where they&amp;#39;re getting the money and we</text>
  <text start="852.6" dur="4.799">knew for a fact that Turkey was</text>
  <text start="855.02" dur="3.64">supporting the Islamic state because</text>
  <text start="857.399" dur="4.411">they have the backing of the United</text>
  <text start="858.66" dur="4.86">States government Israel UK they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="861.81" dur="3.779">and the other Arab nations they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="863.52" dur="3.99">part of this and they all have the</text>
  <text start="865.589" dur="4.021">funding set up to make sure they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="867.51" dur="4.44">self-sufficient and all this is the</text>
  <text start="869.61" dur="5.39">being done covertly and this is why the</text>
  <text start="871.95" dur="9.54">United States coalition bombed</text>
  <text start="875" dur="9.76">refineries they hit the gas oil fields</text>
  <text start="881.49" dur="6.06">they hit the pipeline&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="884.76" dur="4.56">trying to make us and convince us that</text>
  <text start="887.55" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re destroying their revenue but</text>
  <text start="889.32" dur="4.65">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re destroying</text>
  <text start="890.94" dur="5.1">the infrastructure of Syria and we can</text>
  <text start="893.97" dur="3.54">see right now this is not where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="896.04" dur="4.59">getting the money even the UN was out</text>
  <text start="897.51" dur="6.48">there saying listen why don&amp;#39;t we hit the</text>
  <text start="900.63" dur="5.49">convoy of trucks and trucks and destroy</text>
  <text start="903.99" dur="4.2">all their trucks and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="906.12" dur="3.659">not doing this whatsoever because this</text>
  <text start="908.19" dur="5.28">is not how they&amp;#39;re really making their</text>
  <text start="909.779" dur="6.06">money now right now we understand that</text>
  <text start="913.47" dur="4.26">more and more troops are being left in</text>
  <text start="915.839" dur="3.601">Afghanistan more troops will be headed</text>
  <text start="917.73" dur="4.29">towards Afghanistan but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="919.44" dur="4.5">interesting is that officials have said</text>
  <text start="922.02" dur="5.4">that the US military has been ordered to</text>
  <text start="923.94" dur="6.72">transfer aircraft and other resources</text>
  <text start="927.42" dur="5.19">from Afghanistan to the Middle East to</text>
  <text start="930.66" dur="4.23">bolster the airstrikes on the Islamic</text>
  <text start="932.61" dur="4.26">state inside Iraq and Syria so it looks</text>
  <text start="934.89" dur="2.8">like they&amp;#39;re planning on something big</text>
  <text start="936.87" dur="2.56">to happen in</text>
  <text start="937.69" dur="5.46">course they&amp;#39;re bringing the Air Force</text>
  <text start="939.43" dur="6.63">these uh these assets like the a-10</text>
  <text start="943.15" dur="5.79">ground attack aircraft and the Reaper a</text>
  <text start="946.06" dur="5.07">combat unmanned aerial vehicle two bases</text>
  <text start="948.94" dur="4.5">in Kuwait and we also know there is an</text>
  <text start="951.13" dur="5.31">airbase right inside a rack that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="953.44" dur="4.65">took taken over they kicked the Iraqis</text>
  <text start="956.44" dur="3.57">out of there they&amp;#39;re setting up the</text>
  <text start="958.09" dur="4.89">vision headquarters and we can see right</text>
  <text start="960.01" dur="5.52">now these aircrafts most likely will be</text>
  <text start="962.98" dur="5.19">transferred to this airbase and we will</text>
  <text start="965.53" dur="5.73">see more and more military assets come</text>
