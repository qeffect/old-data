  <text start="218.04" dur="5.16">is coming out the system is</text>
  <text start="220.469" dur="4.38">deteriorating at an accelerated pace and</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="3.989">it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="224.849" dur="4.98">as time goes on now this is all part of</text>

  <text start="246.93" dur="3.929">throughout this year it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="249.15" dur="2.94">improve we had something very</text>
  <text start="250.859" dur="5.19">interesting happen today</text>
  <text start="252.09" dur="7.739">the Chicago PMI stats came out today</text>
  <text start="256.049" dur="7.141">around 9:45 a.m. Eastern Standard Time</text>
  <text start="259.829" dur="6.421">and they reported that the index well it</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="6.36">fell from 57 to 55 point two this is the</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="6">lowest since January of 2017 and it</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="5.549">looked like the Chicago PMI was</text>
  <text start="272.25" dur="5.37">declining and then all of a sudden at</text>
  <text start="275.099" dur="4.741">11:21 Eastern Standard Time</text>
  <text start="277.62" dur="4.71">there was a correction and they said oh</text>
  <text start="279.84" dur="6.84">no no it&amp;#39;s not declining it&amp;#39;s improving</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="7.559">and they gave us the manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="5.7">of 59.4 it looked like they let out the</text>
  <text start="289.889" dur="5.551">real numbers and then they realize what</text>
  <text start="292.38" dur="5.279">they did and they revised the numbers</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="4.199">and reissued the number saying this is a</text>
  <text start="297.659" dur="3.721">correction which I thought was very</text>
  <text start="299.639" dur="4.62">interesting now in the real estate</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="6.06">market we see depending home sales well</text>
  <text start="304.259" dur="5.011">they have tumbled to five point four</text>

  <text start="336.259" dur="4.44">time for real estate and we discussed</text>
  <text start="338.419" dur="5.58">this many many times before what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="340.699" dur="6.45">seeing is a complete breakdown of the</text>
  <text start="343.999" dur="6.12">system and it looks like the real estate</text>
  <text start="347.149" dur="5.76">market is going to crash now what we</text>
  <text start="350.119" dur="5.4">need to realize is that there are</text>
  <text start="352.909" dur="4.71">bubbles everywhere there are bubbles in</text>
  <text start="355.519" dur="5.16">the real estate market the Case Shiller</text>
  <text start="357.619" dur="6.09">index that looks at these 20 cities they</text>
  <text start="360.679" dur="6.87">have blown up the bubbles in some areas</text>
  <text start="363.709" dur="6.54">way above what it was back in 2008</text>
  <text start="367.549" dur="5.76">now Minneapolis Fed president Neel</text>
  <text start="370.249" dur="6.24">Kashkari is that they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="373.309" dur="6.51">listen we can&amp;#39;t tell if there is a</text>
  <text start="376.489" dur="6.33">bubble we have a very hard time spawning</text>
  <text start="379.819" dur="5.28">the bubbles remember Ben Bernanke he</text>
  <text start="382.819" dur="4.85">says yeah we can&amp;#39;t tell his bubbles we</text>
  <text start="385.099" dur="5.31">can&amp;#39;t spot them and this is when he was</text>
  <text start="387.669" dur="4.75">telling us there was no recession</text>
  <text start="390.409" dur="5.04">forecasting any type of recession in the</text>
  <text start="392.419" dur="4.8">year of 2008 and in the year of 2008 all</text>
  <text start="395.449" dur="3.87">the bubbles popped and we were in a</text>
  <text start="397.219" dur="4.32">recession so they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="399.319" dur="5.28">us that they can&amp;#39;t figure out where the</text>
  <text start="401.539" dur="4.321">bubbles are and if we look at the 20</text>
  <text start="404.599" dur="3.451">different cities we&amp;#39;re not going to look</text>
  <text start="405.86" dur="4.739">at all of them but if we look at most of</text>
  <text start="408.05" dur="5.959">them we can see that there are bubbles</text>
  <text start="410.599" dur="8.16">let&amp;#39;s look at the case-shiller us home</text>
  <text start="414.009" dur="8.23">price index well as we can see we are</text>
  <text start="418.759" dur="7.38">way above the housing bubble back in</text>
  <text start="422.239" dur="6.93">2008 if we look at different areas like</text>
  <text start="426.139" dur="9.15">in Boston the housing bubble right now</text>
  <text start="429.169" dur="9.3">is 9% above the peak of 2005 if we look</text>
  <text start="435.289" dur="6.95">at Seattle the housing bubble right now</text>
  <text start="438.469" dur="7.95">is 13% above the peak back in July of</text>
  <text start="442.239" dur="7.121">2007 if we look at Denver it is 38</text>
  <text start="446.419" dur="6.39">percent above the housing bubble back in</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="3.929">August of 2006 if we look at dallas-fort</text>
  <text start="452.809" dur="3.6">worth</text>
  <text start="453.289" dur="6.541">it is 37 percent above the housing</text>
  <text start="456.409" dur="6.57">bubble back in June of 2007 Atlanta the</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="6.03">same thing Portland the same thing San</text>
  <text start="462.979" dur="5.94">Francisco the same thing New York the</text>
  <text start="465.86" dur="5.85">same thing so when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="468.919" dur="5.46">can see where the bubbles are we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="5.789">above that bubble range which tells us</text>
  <text start="474.379" dur="6.481">on the way down it is going to be a</text>
  <text start="477.499" dur="6.39">disaster and remember these bubbles were</text>
  <text start="480.86" dur="5.759">propped up not by the everyday American</text>
  <text start="483.889" dur="4.8">it was propped up with free money hedge</text>
  <text start="486.619" dur="4.08">funds and most of these places they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.689" dur="3.93">out there they&amp;#39;re completely empty no</text>
  <text start="490.699" dur="2.46">one&amp;#39;s even living in them some are</text>
  <text start="492.619" dur="2.931">rented</text>
  <text start="493.159" dur="5.87">but these hedge funds have purchased</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="6.639">thousands upon thousands of homes</text>
  <text start="499.029" dur="5.62">foreign buyers came in and they bought</text>
  <text start="502.189" dur="4.41">them as investments rent them if you can</text>
  <text start="504.649" dur="4.711">hold on to them let them go up in value</text>
  <text start="506.599" dur="5.34">and when this comes down it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="4.44">be a complete disaster and we can see</text>
  <text start="511.939" dur="5.4">these bubbles from a mile away</text>
  <text start="513.8" dur="5.82">so can the said they&amp;#39;re lying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.339" dur="3.421">the ones who created the bubbles but</text>
  <text start="519.62" dur="3.75">they don&amp;#39;t want to they want to pretend</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="6.059">that we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t see anything now</text>
  <text start="523.37" dur="6.24">we see a bubble in the tech market there</text>

  <text start="707.839" dur="5.071">system breakdown and we can see it we</text>
  <text start="711.499" dur="4.56">can see what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="712.91" dur="5.369">everyday people&amp;#39;s economy when you look</text>
  <text start="716.059" dur="4.231">around you see stores closing you see</text>
  <text start="718.279" dur="2.791">more and more houses for sale there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="720.29" dur="2.85">traffic</text>
  <text start="721.07" dur="4.17">you see the housing bubbles have been</text>
  <text start="723.14" dur="6.33">blown up to the top and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="725.24" dur="5.99">ready to pop and again this is the plan</text>
  <text start="729.47" dur="5.94">of the central bank this is the plan of</text>
  <text start="731.23" dur="7.84">Trump now we have to remember Trump is</text>
  <text start="735.41" dur="7.41">an office right now and he is preparing</text>
  <text start="739.07" dur="6.72">us for this transition and the only way</text>
  <text start="742.82" dur="5.79">to do this is to cut off the funding</text>
  <text start="745.79" dur="4.17">from the central bank because this is</text>
  <text start="748.61" dur="3.45">how the deep State survives remember the</text>
  <text start="749.96" dur="4.5">deep state is intertwined into</text>
  <text start="752.06" dur="4.23">government they have their claws in</text>
  <text start="754.46" dur="3.9">everything they&amp;#39;ve been there for quite</text>
  <text start="756.29" dur="4.53">a while they&amp;#39;ve been listening in to all</text>
  <text start="758.36" dur="3.84">conversations they are trying to find</text>
  <text start="760.82" dur="3.96">something on Trump and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="762.2" dur="5.94">whatever they possibly can and Fitch</text>
  <text start="764.78" dur="5.16">came out with a warning saying that the</text>
  <text start="768.14" dur="4.08">most plausible scenario for the dollar</text>
  <text start="769.94" dur="4.44">being meaningfully displaced does not</text>
  <text start="772.22" dur="4.47">begin with the emergence of a viable</text>
  <text start="774.38" dur="6.09">alternative but rather it being</text>
  <text start="776.69" dur="5.82">undermined right here in the US and they</text>
  <text start="780.47" dur="5.46">are right because what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="782.51" dur="4.92">right now he is doing many of the things</text>
  <text start="785.93" dur="3.96">behind the scenes and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="787.43" dur="4.92">Trump there are many other individuals</text>
  <text start="789.89" dur="5.55">that are working with him and remember</text>
  <text start="792.35" dur="5.82">he needs to tread lightly through all of</text>
  <text start="795.44" dur="5.16">this because the deep state they will</text>
  <text start="798.17" dur="3.72">try to stop them at every turn and it</text>
  <text start="800.6" dur="3.69">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that this plan is going to</text>
  <text start="801.89" dur="4.44">work just like the central bank&amp;#39;s plan</text>
  <text start="804.29" dur="5.31">the deep state plans don&amp;#39;t always work</text>
  <text start="806.33" dur="5.73">but we can see that they are moving in</text>
  <text start="809.6" dur="5.31">this direction now one way they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="812.06" dur="5.7">trying to cut off the funding and bring</text>
  <text start="814.91" dur="7.14">the system down and to remove the dollar</text>
  <text start="817.76" dur="6.66">is they&amp;#39;re trying to pass two pieces of</text>
  <text start="822.05" dur="4.5">legislation and they&amp;#39;re working their</text>
  <text start="824.42" dur="3.99">way through Congress one is called the</text>
  <text start="826.55" dur="4.44">Federal Reserve transparency a</text>
  <text start="828.41" dur="6.18">transparency Act and the other is the</text>
  <text start="830.99" dur="4.77">financial choice act now the first would</text>
  <text start="834.59" dur="3.75">allow the Government Accountability</text>
  <text start="835.76" dur="5.07">Office to audit the monetary policy</text>
  <text start="838.34" dur="4.41">decisions of the Fed and make subsequent</text>
  <text start="840.83" dur="5.36">recommendations for administrative or</text>
  <text start="842.75" dur="6.78">legislative action now this is not the</text>
  <text start="846.19" dur="6.88">surface level audits this is a deep</text>
  <text start="849.53" dur="4.98">audit to find out what the Fed has been</text>
  <text start="853.07" dur="4.08">up to this</text>
  <text start="854.51" dur="4.68">ii would restrict the feds ability to</text>
  <text start="857.15" dur="5.04">provide financial sector support to</text>
  <text start="859.19" dur="5.46">avert or address a crisis and empower a</text>
  <text start="862.19" dur="4.95">commission to review and recommend</text>
  <text start="864.65" dur="5.64">changes to feds operations as well as to</text>
  <text start="867.14" dur="5.51">consider a rules-based rather than a</text>
  <text start="870.29" dur="4.5">discretionary monetary policy framework</text>
  <text start="872.65" dur="4.15">basically what these pieces of</text>
  <text start="874.79" dur="3.78">legislation are doing is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="876.8" dur="4.53">going to be taking control of the</text>
  <text start="878.57" dur="5.61">Federal Reserve and this needs to be</text>
  <text start="881.33" dur="8.37">done now remember this is part of the</text>
  <text start="884.18" dur="6.93">plan to counter the deep state and again</text>
  <text start="889.7" dur="3.39">the deep state is going to try to</text>
  <text start="891.11" dur="5.22">maneuver and they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="893.09" dur="6.3">stop this now if these pieces of</text>
  <text start="896.33" dur="4.74">legislation are implemented the proposal</text>
  <text start="899.39" dur="5.7">would diminish the appeal of a dollar as</text>
  <text start="901.07" dur="6.72">a reserve currency over time investors</text>
  <text start="905.09" dur="5.16">considering dollar assets and other</text>
  <text start="907.79" dur="5.04">dollar exposures would weigh the risk of</text>
  <text start="910.25" dur="5.22">political interference in a monetary</text>
  <text start="912.83" dur="5.28">policy decisions and the possibility of</text>
  <text start="915.47" dur="4.98">the feds remit being broadened to</text>
  <text start="918.11" dur="4.38">include congressional priorities such as</text>
  <text start="920.45" dur="5.16">indirect funding of infrastructure</text>
  <text start="922.49" dur="6.38">investment now those individuals that</text>
  <text start="925.61" dur="6.72">are supporting the F RTA and the FCA</text>
  <text start="928.87" dur="4.93">they argue that the risks identified by</text>
  <text start="932.33" dur="3.63">those concerned about the feds</text>
  <text start="933.8" dur="4.26">independence and incidentally the</text>
  <text start="935.96" dur="6.27">dollars global role are in fact the</text>
  <text start="938.06" dur="7.08">purpose of the proposed legislation so</text>
  <text start="942.23" dur="6.51">Fitch is warning that if the world is</text>
  <text start="945.14" dur="7.14">granted more transparency into the said</text>
  <text start="948.74" dur="8.36">and what it does and how it works it</text>
  <text start="952.28" dur="7.73">would end the u.s. hegemony and the US</text>
  <text start="957.1" dur="6.18">would lose its place as the sole</text>
  <text start="960.01" dur="6.52">dominant geopolitical superpower and</text>
  <text start="963.28" dur="6.97">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do right</text>
  <text start="966.53" dur="5.43">now they are trying to rework the system</text>
  <text start="970.25" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re trying to get this legislation</text>
  <text start="971.96" dur="5.31">passed and remember there are many</text>
  <text start="974.06" dur="5.19">things happening all at once and just</text>
  <text start="977.27" dur="3.96">like someone working in a corporation</text>
  <text start="979.25" dur="2.76">and you&amp;#39;re trying to change things in a</text>
  <text start="981.23" dur="3.12">corporation</text>
  <text start="982.01" dur="4.44">especially when you have everyone</text>
  <text start="984.35" dur="4.22">fighting against you you just can&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="986.45" dur="3.74">out and say hey I&amp;#39;m doing this I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="988.57" dur="3.36">doing that I don&amp;#39;t care what you say</text>
  <text start="990.19" dur="3">because we could see this didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="991.93" dur="4.38">just like in government actually</text>
  <text start="993.19" dur="6.48">governments even worse Trump tried in</text>
  <text start="996.31" dur="5.19">the beginning to make deals and work</text>
  <text start="999.67" dur="3.54">with the deep state because I think in</text>
  <text start="1001.5" dur="4.92">his mind that he thought that he&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="1003.21" dur="4.65">able to work as a businessman with these</text>
  <text start="1006.42" dur="4.44">individuals but these individuals are</text>
  <text start="1007.86" dur="4.8">not businessmen or business women these</text>
  <text start="1010.86" dur="4.17">individuals are part of a deep state</text>
  <text start="1012.66" dur="4.05">system where they want where they want</text>
  <text start="1015.03" dur="3.93">what they want and they talk in</text>
  <text start="1016.71" dur="5.13">absolutes and they don&amp;#39;t see any gray</text>
  <text start="1018.96" dur="6.36">areas the gray area is the negotiation</text>
  <text start="1021.84" dur="5.85">they don&amp;#39;t see any of this so Trump has</text>
  <text start="1025.32" dur="5.73">completely changed his tactic right now</text>
  <text start="1027.69" dur="7.5">and you can see bit by bit he needs to</text>
  <text start="1031.05" dur="7.26">unravel and remove what the deep state</text>
  <text start="1035.19" dur="5.46">has done and one of those ways and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1038.31" dur="5.01">remember it&amp;#39;s not just him he&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="1040.65" dur="6.21">with other individuals that are with him</text>
  <text start="1043.32" dur="6.27">on this they&amp;#39;re trying to cut off the</text>
  <text start="1046.86" dur="4.14">funding of these individuals because</text>
  <text start="1049.59" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s the only way you can destroy them</text>
  <text start="1051" dur="5.31">and this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1053.4" dur="4.71">right now and in the process they will</text>
  <text start="1056.31" dur="3.81">get rid of the central bank now this</text>
  <text start="1058.11" dur="4.92">will have a cascading effect of course</text>
  <text start="1060.12" dur="5.61">because that threatens the dollar as a</text>
  <text start="1063.03" dur="5.21">reserve currency it removes the central</text>
  <text start="1065.73" dur="5.94">bank which puts the whole system into</text>
  <text start="1068.24" dur="5.92">chaos and this is where we are headed</text>
  <text start="1071.67" dur="5.01">right now now remember Trump was out in</text>
  <text start="1074.16" dur="5.04">Saudi Arabia he was out in the Middle</text>
  <text start="1076.68" dur="5.58">East and we can see right now OPEC has</text>
  <text start="1079.2" dur="4.59">come up with a new strategy to balance</text>
  <text start="1082.26" dur="3.72">their oil market now remember Saudi</text>
  <text start="1083.79" dur="4.83">Arabia has been speaking to Russia Trump</text>
  <text start="1085.98" dur="6.69">has also sent a representative to the</text>
  <text start="1088.62" dur="6">China&amp;#39;s belton Road conference and we</text>
  <text start="1092.67" dur="4.2">can see right now that OPEC well they</text>
  <text start="1094.62" dur="5.73">have a new strategy to balance the oil</text>
  <text start="1096.87" dur="6.45">market and it&amp;#39;s to cut oil exports to</text>
  <text start="1100.35" dur="6.27">the US a move intended to drain near</text>
  <text start="1103.32" dur="5.04">record high crude oil inventories OPEC</text>
  <text start="1106.62" dur="3.33">originally thought the six months of</text>
  <text start="1108.36" dur="3.42">combined production cuts will be</text>
  <text start="1109.95" dur="4.98">sufficient to balance the oil market but</text>
  <text start="1111.78" dur="5.1">the market still looks oversupplied so</text>
  <text start="1114.93" dur="3.42">in a global marketplace why does it</text>
  <text start="1116.88" dur="3.96">really matter where the Saudis send</text>
  <text start="1118.35" dur="4.079">their oil in terms of a global supply a</text>
  <text start="1120.84" dur="3.209">barrel sent to Asia</text>
  <text start="1122.429" dur="4.95">is the same as a barrel exported to the</text>
  <text start="1124.049" dur="7.08">US but the difference is is that the US</text>
  <text start="1127.379" dur="5.49">has real-time data on crude oil storage</text>
  <text start="1131.129" dur="4.8">unlike most other places in the world</text>
  <text start="1132.869" dur="5.371">and that data is publicly available so</text>
  <text start="1135.929" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re going to use this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1138.24" dur="5.1">going to experiment by cutting off oil</text>
  <text start="1140.519" dur="4.65">to the United States bringing down the</text>
  <text start="1143.34" dur="4.079">amount of oil that is being brought into</text>
  <text start="1145.169" dur="5.551">the United States which means we might</text>
  <text start="1147.419" dur="5.191">see oil prices move up a little bit from</text>
  <text start="1150.72" dur="4.649">this but we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this all</text>
  <text start="1152.61" dur="7.069">turns out and I think behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="1155.369" dur="7.201">what this is all about is shifting the</text>
  <text start="1159.679" dur="5.921">shipments of oil now remember Trump is</text>
  <text start="1162.57" dur="6.27">looking in Alaska he&amp;#39;s looking to drill</text>
  <text start="1165.6" dur="5.64">offshore he&amp;#39;s looking at the land he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1168.84" dur="4.409">looking at what natural resources there</text>
  <text start="1171.24" dur="3.929">are there&amp;#39;s a review going on right now</text>
  <text start="1173.249" dur="2.491">so when we start putting all this</text>
  <text start="1175.169" dur="2.73">together</text>
  <text start="1175.74" dur="6.21">we can see where this is all headed and</text>
  <text start="1177.899" dur="7.62">he has to do this one step at a time one</text>
  <text start="1181.95" dur="6.12">piece of legislation at a time and as we</text>
  <text start="1185.519" dur="6.6">move forward he will be doing more and</text>
  <text start="1188.07" dur="6.089">more and we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="1192.119" dur="3.66">in the central bank the deep state they</text>
  <text start="1194.159" dur="3.15">are pushing to bring down the system</text>
  <text start="1195.779" dur="4.081">they want to control what is happening</text>
  <text start="1197.309" dur="4.44">because once they do this in their minds</text>
  <text start="1199.86" dur="3.779">they think they can stop everything that</text>
  <text start="1201.749" dur="3.51">is happening because the Trump will be</text>
  <text start="1203.639" dur="3.78">too busy with the collapse that they</text>
  <text start="1205.259" dur="3.961">created this legislation might</text>
  <text start="1207.419" dur="3.51">completely disappear we might have an</text>
  <text start="1209.22" dur="4.409">event that follows along with this and</text>
  <text start="1210.929" dur="7.681">this is part of their plan his plan is</text>
  <text start="1213.629" dur="7.53">to get all of this past or very close to</text>
  <text start="1218.61" dur="5.46">getting past trying to unravel what</text>
  <text start="1221.159" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;ve done and make a move to get rid</text>
  <text start="1224.07" dur="3.569">of the deep state and the central bank</text>
  <text start="1225.779" dur="3.931">and we can see there&amp;#39;s a huge fight</text>
  <text start="1227.639" dur="4.38">going on right now but one thing is for</text>
  <text start="1229.71" dur="5.699">sure we are going to go through a period</text>
  <text start="1232.019" dur="5.221">where it&amp;#39;s going to be a huge reset and</text>
  <text start="1235.409" dur="5.311">during this period it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="1237.24" dur="5.639">difficult to get supplies to get oil</text>
  <text start="1240.72" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult to get</text>
  <text start="1242.879" dur="4.65">food it&amp;#39;s very difficult to get anything</text>
  <text start="1245.85" dur="3.6">because credit is going to freeze up the</text>
