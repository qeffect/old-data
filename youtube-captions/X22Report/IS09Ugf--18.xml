  <text start="107.6" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the crypto</text>
  <text start="108.71" dur="4.74">market and the cryptocurrencies they are</text>
  <text start="111.41" dur="3.06">growing right now and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="113.45" dur="3.63">individuals getting into</text>
  <text start="114.47" dur="6.39">cryptocurrencies and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="117.08" dur="5.7">IRS is coming down on those individuals</text>
  <text start="120.86" dur="4.83">that are investing in crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="122.78" dur="5.13">on Tuesday a California federal court</text>
  <text start="125.69" dur="4.709">ordered the crypto currency exchange</text>
  <text start="127.91" dur="5.9">coinbase to turn over records on</text>
  <text start="130.399" dur="6.091">thousands of customers to the IRS and</text>
  <text start="133.81" dur="4.72">this means that they&amp;#39;re going to turn</text>
  <text start="136.49" dur="5.01">over birthday to address account</text>
  <text start="138.53" dur="5.52">activity for any user who bought sold</text>
  <text start="141.5" dur="4.62">sent or received more than twenty</text>
  <text start="144.05" dur="5.49">thousand worth of Bitcoin in their</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="5.34">accounts between 2013 and 2015 now we</text>
  <text start="149.54" dur="3.96">need to understand that right now US</text>
  <text start="151.46" dur="4.59">citizens are supposed to pay capital</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="5.79">gains tax on cryptocurrency because</text>
  <text start="156.05" dur="8.28">right now the IRS looks at this and they</text>
  <text start="159.29" dur="8.85">see it as a investment where there is</text>
  <text start="164.33" dur="6.32">capital gains and the court order shows</text>
  <text start="168.14" dur="5.31">more than 10,000 people bought or sold</text>
  <text start="170.65" dur="7.6">more than 20,000 worth of cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="173.45" dur="7.5">but only 800 to 900 taxpayers have</text>
  <text start="178.25" dur="6.39">actually filed so it looks like the IRS</text>
  <text start="180.95" dur="4.98">now is going after those individuals who</text>
  <text start="184.64" dur="4.439">are dealing in crip</text>
  <text start="185.93" dur="4.44">currencies most likely Bitcoin at this</text>
  <text start="189.079" dur="4.47">point and then it will spread to other</text>
  <text start="190.37" dur="4.89">areas to try to get their currency</text>
  <text start="193.549" dur="5.041">because you have to remember the IRS is</text>
  <text start="195.26" dur="6.47">an arm of the central bank they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="198.59" dur="7.319">task force that goes out and collects on</text>
  <text start="201.73" dur="7.089">their on their debt that they push out</text>
  <text start="205.909" dur="6.33">to the world and they want the interest</text>
  <text start="208.819" dur="6.84">payments they want the the currency or</text>
  <text start="212.239" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;ll take whatever they can take and</text>
  <text start="215.659" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;ve done this to countries I mean</text>
  <text start="217.549" dur="3.651">are they going to come in and take you</text>
  <text start="219.169" dur="5.371">know an individual you know person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.2" dur="5.409">house or stuff like that yeah that does</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="3.99">happen but the central bankers are more</text>
  <text start="226.609" dur="6.511">interested the people who are running it</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="7.439">are more interested in taking land and</text>
  <text start="233.12" dur="4.47">huge swaths of ports and things like</text>
  <text start="235.969" dur="3.45">that from countries where they can</text>
  <text start="237.59" dur="4.259">control the country they can put them</text>
  <text start="239.419" dur="6.3">into debt but they want the people to be</text>
  <text start="241.849" dur="7.2">enslaved in their system and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="245.719" dur="7.38">trying to stop everyone everywhere from</text>
  <text start="249.049" dur="5.671">dealing in anything outside of the</text>
  <text start="253.099" dur="4.14">Federal Reserve Note that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="5.91">everything outside of it is considered</text>
  <text start="257.239" dur="6.031">theirs because if you invest in a house</text>
  <text start="260.63" dur="4.95">if you invest in gold or silver if you</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="3.869">invest in cryptocurrencies if you invest</text>
  <text start="265.58" dur="4.2">in the stock market which is really not</text>
  <text start="267.139" dur="5.28">the Federal Reserve Note if you make a</text>
  <text start="269.78" dur="6.18">gain and you go and you transfer it into</text>
  <text start="272.419" dur="6.211">dollars you have to pay for that gain</text>
  <text start="275.96" dur="5.19">because they want their piece of the</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="4.409">action because you&amp;#39;re dealing in the</text>
  <text start="281.15" dur="3.72">Federal Reserve Note if you just keep it</text>
  <text start="283.039" dur="6">in that investment and you never cash</text>
  <text start="284.87" dur="6.06">out you don&amp;#39;t have to worry so we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="289.039" dur="4.38">what happens with these individuals how</text>
  <text start="290.93" dur="5.91">far they can get and if coinbase</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="5.191">goes along with this we see right now</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="5.52">the New York Times is out there and</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;ve reported a piece that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.36" dur="7.679">going to get rid of Tillerson and</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="8.339">replace Tillerson with Pompeo and what</text>
  <text start="310.039" dur="5.761">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this</text>
  <text start="313.159" dur="4.051">story might not be true now the New York</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="3.63">Times is reporting that they got this</text>
  <text start="317.21" dur="3.6">anonymous source within the white house</text>
  <text start="319.43" dur="2.82">and this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen now</text>
  <text start="320.81" dur="4.889">the White House has come out and said</text>
  <text start="322.25" dur="6.06">yeah no changes are planned at the State</text>
  <text start="325.699" dur="5.701">Department Trump is not firing Tillerson</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="4.919">he&amp;#39;s not being replaced and we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="331.4" dur="3.45">to see how this all plays out and Trump</text>
  <text start="333.229" dur="4.201">is already out there saying that the New</text>
  <text start="334.85" dur="5.46">York Times is fake news now once again</text>
  <text start="337.43" dur="5.4">this might have been set up where there</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="3.81">was a leak to see what the New York</text>
  <text start="342.83" dur="4.38">Times would do with it if they would</text>
  <text start="344.12" dur="4.41">actually go you know go ahead and</text>
  <text start="347.21" dur="5.04">actually do a little bit more research</text>
  <text start="348.53" dur="6">in you know discovering is this true is</text>
  <text start="352.25" dur="4.71">this not true you know let&amp;#39;s talk to</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="4.02">other sources but it looks like they ran</text>
  <text start="356.96" dur="3.929">with the story and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="358.55" dur="4.53">right now is that there&amp;#39;s a lot of sites</text>
  <text start="360.889" dur="4.351">that are just popping up in all</text>
  <text start="363.08" dur="4.17">different areas where they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="365.24" dur="3.12">out all these different fake news</text>
  <text start="367.25" dur="2.669">stories and I&amp;#39;m not talking about the</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="3.36">corporate media I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="369.919" dur="3.901">alternative media where a lot of them</text>
  <text start="371.72" dur="5.34">are just outrageous and I think this is</text>
  <text start="373.82" dur="5.969">an attempt to muddy the waters where</text>
  <text start="377.06" dur="5.1">other alternative media sites go ahead</text>
  <text start="379.789" dur="5.071">and report on it to try to mess them up</text>
  <text start="382.16" dur="4.259">to CC you shouldn&amp;#39;t be listening to them</text>
  <text start="384.86" dur="3.51">because they&amp;#39;re not telling you the</text>
  <text start="386.419" dur="4.891">truth they came up with this crazy story</text>
  <text start="388.37" dur="5.25">and we can see right now that this is</text>
  <text start="391.31" dur="4.95">something this is a tactic that they use</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="3.6">to try to convince everyone that you</text>
  <text start="396.26" dur="2.31">shouldn&amp;#39;t be listening to the</text>
  <text start="397.22" dur="3.09">alternative media and remember they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.57" dur="5.61">trying whatever they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="6.81">shut down any other type of information</text>
  <text start="404.18" dur="4.53">that has to do with what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="407.12" dur="3.75">around the world they just want you to</text>
  <text start="408.71" dur="4.8">listen to the korver media whatever they</text>
  <text start="410.87" dur="5.13">say that should be it we see right now</text>
  <text start="413.51" dur="5.1">that US Congress has withdrawn arty</text>
  <text start="416" dur="4.979">America&amp;#39;s capital credentials Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="418.61" dur="4.35">planning to retaliate Russia is going to</text>
  <text start="420.979" dur="4.021">classify state purchases to protect</text>
  <text start="422.96" dur="4.679">foreign firms from US sanctions and</text>
  <text start="425" dur="5.099">Moscow right now has exempted Russian</text>
  <text start="427.639" dur="5.011">state-run companies and departments from</text>

  <text start="435.44" dur="5.039">signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev</text>
  <text start="438.26" dur="5.04">and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="440.479" dur="6.631">trying to protect the different</text>
  <text start="443.3" dur="6.54">corporations different state-run</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="5.88">companies from US sanctions they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.84" dur="3.72">trying to block all this and once again</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="2.07">we can</text>
  <text start="453.56" dur="3.77">you already that Russia came out with a</text>
  <text start="455.06" dur="5.52">warning to the United States listen if</text>
  <text start="457.33" dur="7.3">you or when you implement more sanctions</text>
  <text start="460.58" dur="6.69">do not confiscate our gold our reserves</text>
  <text start="464.63" dur="4.02">because this would be financial war and</text>
  <text start="467.27" dur="4.11">you can see why they&amp;#39;re saying this</text>
  <text start="468.65" dur="4.05">because the Cabal they&amp;#39;re gonna become</text>
  <text start="471.38" dur="4.039">desperate they&amp;#39;re gonna go after</text>
  <text start="472.7" dur="4.32">everything they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="475.419" dur="5.291">eventually what they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="477.02" dur="6.72">do is go after gold go after reserves go</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="6">after anything they possibly can to stay</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="5.399">alive we said that we see that North</text>
  <text start="486.71" dur="5.37">Korea they have released photos of the</text>
  <text start="489.139" dur="5.25">ICBM which is of course capable of</text>
  <text start="492.08" dur="3.87">hitting the US and this is the story</text>
  <text start="494.389" dur="4.261">that they&amp;#39;re going with they&amp;#39;re playing</text>
  <text start="495.95" dur="5.279">this up big time right now so everyone</text>
  <text start="498.65" dur="5.4">gets scared and everyone is frightened</text>
  <text start="501.229" dur="7.321">about North Korea but as we know North</text>
  <text start="504.05" dur="7.88">Korea is not going to fire an ICBM and</text>
  <text start="508.55" dur="5.669">hit the United States it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="511.93" dur="5.77">everyone was calling for war in</text>
  <text start="514.219" dur="5.611">September October November North Korea</text>
  <text start="517.7" dur="5.25">is protecting themselves from the Cabal</text>
  <text start="519.83" dur="6.48">and like I said last report I do believe</text>
  <text start="522.95" dur="9.09">that they&amp;#39;re allowing North Korea to</text>
  <text start="526.31" dur="11.1">develop and to become a nuclear power</text>
  <text start="532.04" dur="7.86">now once they do this the IAEA is going</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="5.04">to go in there and inspect they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="539.9" dur="4.439">to keep an eye on them and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="542.45" dur="3.389">make sure that North Korea is abiding by</text>
  <text start="544.339" dur="4.201">all the rules just like the rest of the</text>
  <text start="545.839" dur="4.921">countries now the u.s. is out there and</text>
  <text start="548.54" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re telling all the countries out</text>
  <text start="550.76" dur="5.82">there saying that they must cut ties</text>
  <text start="553.01" dur="6.96">with North Korea they want China to stop</text>
  <text start="556.58" dur="5.25">dealing with North Korea and basically</text>
  <text start="559.97" dur="3.48">China and Russia are saying yeah this</text>
  <text start="561.83" dur="3.72">would be a big mistake I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="563.45" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re gonna follow along in these type</text>
  <text start="565.55" dur="4.26">of suggestions and we&amp;#39;re gonna do our</text>
  <text start="567.98" dur="4.59">own things we&amp;#39;re gonna continue with the</text>
  <text start="569.81" dur="5.43">diplomatic talks and we&amp;#39;re going to stay</text>
  <text start="572.57" dur="4.86">close to North Korea now something else</text>
  <text start="575.24" dur="3.599">that&amp;#39;s very interesting is that there</text>
  <text start="577.43" dur="3.48">are news reports out there saying that</text>
  <text start="578.839" dur="6.241">Chinese troops they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="580.91" dur="6.7">deploying into Syria now this makes no</text>
  <text start="585.08" dur="5.5">sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="6">the Islamic state and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="590.58" dur="4.41">jihadists the al-qaeda the moderate</text>
  <text start="593.61" dur="4.919">rebels the Syrian democratic forces</text>
  <text start="594.99" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re finished in Syria this is the</text>
  <text start="598.529" dur="7.891">end stage of all of this</text>
  <text start="601.83" dur="7.47">why would China send troops in now they</text>
  <text start="606.42" dur="7.05">should have sent it in you know a month</text>
  <text start="609.3" dur="7.229">or a year ago and now there&amp;#39;s a story</text>
  <text start="613.47" dur="4.47">saying that according to reports Chinese</text>
  <text start="616.529" dur="3.841">special forces are going to be deployed</text>
  <text start="617.94" dur="5.399">in Syria to help defeat the estimated</text>
  <text start="620.37" dur="5.67">you know twenty-five hundred other types</text>
  <text start="623.339" dur="3.811">of separatist currently fighting near</text>
  <text start="626.04" dur="4.35">the Turkish border</text>
  <text start="627.15" dur="4.92">now China came out and said yeah this is</text>
  <text start="630.39" dur="4.53">not true we&amp;#39;re not sending any type of</text>
  <text start="632.07" dur="5.82">troops there we have no knowledge of</text>
  <text start="634.92" dur="6.09">this and once again this looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="637.89" dur="6.9">fake news now maybe China&amp;#39;s lying but to</text>
  <text start="641.01" dur="7.71">me why would China all of a sudden send</text>
  <text start="644.79" dur="7.44">in troops when Russia is saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="648.72" dur="6.3">removing their troops Syria has taken</text>
  <text start="652.23" dur="5.58">back the country this makes no sense and</text>
  <text start="655.02" dur="5.37">this looks like this is another attempt</text>
  <text start="657.81" dur="4.29">to muddy the waters and make it seem</text>
  <text start="660.39" dur="4.41">like something&amp;#39;s happening when it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="662.1" dur="4.8">because as we can see everything is</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="4.62">falling apart in Syria for the Cabal I</text>
  <text start="666.9" dur="4.28">mean this is the end game for them there</text>
  <text start="669.42" dur="6.39">unless they have some type of an event</text>
  <text start="671.18" dur="7.06">they&amp;#39;re done we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="675.81" dur="5.01">Iraqi forces the senior commander is</text>
  <text start="678.24" dur="4.349">saying listen once the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="680.82" dur="4.94">completely out of our country and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="682.589" dur="10.291">almost we&amp;#39;re almost there we want the US</text>
  <text start="685.76" dur="8.77">forces to leave we want us gone and this</text>
  <text start="692.88" dur="4.14">is not the only place we&amp;#39;re hearing this</text>
  <text start="694.53" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re hearing this from Syria and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="697.02" dur="5.01">very interesting is that there are four</text>
  <text start="699.72" dur="5.13">hundred US Marines they&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="702.03" dur="6.36">leaving Syria right now because their</text>
  <text start="704.85" dur="6.33">mission is complete the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="708.39" dur="4.41">pretty much gone and there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="711.18" dur="4.38">for the forces to be there now we know</text>
  <text start="712.8" dur="5.73">there&amp;#39;s a lot more forces there than 400</text>
  <text start="715.56" dur="5.52">and I think this is the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="718.53" dur="5.85">US forces where they&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="721.08" dur="6.54">moving them from Syria now the cabal</text>
  <text start="724.38" dur="5.64">knows this they know that the forces are</text>
  <text start="727.62" dur="4.95">gonna end up leaving they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="730.02" dur="4.35">recalled and there&amp;#39;s gonna be nothing</text>
  <text start="732.57" dur="3.78">that they can do about this unless</text>
  <text start="734.37" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s some type of an event of course</text>
  <text start="736.35" dur="5.28">which we might see happen but at this</text>
  <text start="739.47" dur="3.69">point we can see that out of the</text>
  <text start="741.63" dur="4.14">thousands and thousands of troops that</text>
  <text start="743.16" dur="3.75">they have in Syria and Iraq a lot of</text>
  <text start="745.77" dur="3.45">these troops are going to be coming home</text>
  <text start="746.91" dur="5.25">and we&amp;#39;re already starting to see the</text>
  <text start="749.22" dur="5.91">beginning stages of this because again</text>
  <text start="752.16" dur="5.04">Russia Syria they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="755.13" dur="5.55">there&amp;#39;s no reason for the United States</text>
  <text start="757.2" dur="6.18">to be in Syria anymore it&amp;#39;s against</text>
  <text start="760.68" dur="4.32">international law it&amp;#39;s an invasion if</text>
  <text start="763.38" dur="3.12">you really look at it from their</text>
  <text start="765" dur="3.33">perspective because they never got</text>
  <text start="766.5" dur="4.86">permission from the elected government</text>
  <text start="768.33" dur="6.39">and at this point the United States has</text>
  <text start="771.36" dur="6.09">no choice but to leave and it has</text>
  <text start="774.72" dur="4.82">already started now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="777.45" dur="4.83">Syrian army they have shifted attention</text>
  <text start="779.54" dur="5.2">to the remaining jihadist groups since</text>
  <text start="782.28" dur="4.47">the Islamic state is nearly defeated and</text>
  <text start="784.74" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re going after many other jihadist</text>
  <text start="786.75" dur="6.45">groups and they&amp;#39;re cleaning house right</text>
  <text start="789.54" dur="6.24">now now again the Cabal they are not</text>
  <text start="793.2" dur="5.79">finished they&amp;#39;re hanging on they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="795.78" dur="4.92">still trying to push their event and we</text>
  <text start="798.99" dur="3.66">can see right now that they&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="800.7" dur="5.64">out of time we&amp;#39;re getting close to the</text>
  <text start="802.65" dur="6.84">end here very close so NATO has come out</text>
  <text start="806.34" dur="8.07">and they are warning of World War 3</text>
  <text start="809.49" dur="7.08">Hyper war because of the constant cyber</text>
  <text start="814.41" dur="5.13">attacks from North Korea China and</text>
  <text start="816.57" dur="4.53">Russia now NATO is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="819.54" dur="4.71">saying that they&amp;#39;re continually being</text>
  <text start="821.1" dur="6.3">bombarded by cyber attacks and we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="824.25" dur="5.01">the brink of a hyper war and this is</text>
  <text start="827.4" dur="4.2">from the growing threat of China and</text>
  <text start="829.26" dur="4.29">Russia and North Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="831.6" dur="4.65">monitoring North Korea they&amp;#39;re hitting</text>
  <text start="833.55" dur="5.25">the infrastructure they&amp;#39;re hitting the</text>
  <text start="836.25" dur="5.39">financial institutions and they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="838.8" dur="6.06">there trying to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="841.64" dur="6.88">this could be a trigger for World War 3</text>
  <text start="844.86" dur="6.3">now Russia and China they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="848.52" dur="4.92">to start a war they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="851.16" dur="3.57">hitting the financial institutions they</text>
  <text start="853.44" dur="4.589">don&amp;#39;t need to do this</text>
  <text start="854.73" dur="5.82">they already know the entire Western</text>
  <text start="858.029" dur="5.131">economy is gonna be coming down they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="860.55" dur="6.659">already part of this there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="863.16" dur="7.859">to start the war and if you look back</text>
  <text start="867.209" dur="5.94">over time Russia China they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="871.019" dur="6.331">calling for peace they&amp;#39;ve been calling</text>
  <text start="873.149" dur="9.361">for economic cooperation around the</text>
  <text start="877.35" dur="7.56">world and once again they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="882.51" dur="4.74">to be cyber attacking the United States</text>
  <text start="884.91" dur="4.619">it&amp;#39;s the cabal with the central bank</text>
  <text start="887.25" dur="5.16">here in the United States that wants</text>
  <text start="889.529" dur="6.961">some type of war some type of an event</text>
  <text start="892.41" dur="6.33">to cover all of this up and you can see</text>
  <text start="896.49" dur="4.44">right now they&amp;#39;re still trying to push</text>
  <text start="898.74" dur="5.039">this and this is why everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="900.93" dur="7.38">be concerned about some type of an event</text>
  <text start="903.779" dur="8.55">occurring to bring us to war but as we</text>
  <text start="908.31" dur="7.32">can see if we were gonna stop North</text>
  <text start="912.329" dur="4.62">Korea from becoming a nuclear power this</text>
  <text start="915.63" dur="5.069">would have done this would have been</text>
  <text start="916.949" dur="7.32">done a long time ago think back to Iraq</text>
  <text start="920.699" dur="6.87">think back to Libya think back to Syria</text>
  <text start="924.269" dur="5.041">to Ukraine now with Iraq they said they</text>
  <text start="927.569" dur="4.83">had weapons of mass destruction we</text>
  <text start="929.31" dur="5.18">needed to stop them and we needed to go</text>
  <text start="932.399" dur="5.88">in there before they built bigger</text>
  <text start="934.49" dur="5.709">weapons of mass destruction and of</text>
  <text start="938.279" dur="4.11">course they showed you know there are</text>
  <text start="940.199" dur="3.811">little evidence to convince us this is</text>
  <text start="942.389" dur="3.841">why we needed to go in Iraq but we knew</text>
  <text start="944.01" dur="4.019">the real reason is because Iraq decided</text>
  <text start="946.23" dur="4.109">to sell their oil not using the dollar</text>
  <text start="948.029" dur="5.31">now they had the evidence with North</text>
  <text start="950.339" dur="4.891">Korea showing that oh look they shot</text>
  <text start="953.339" dur="3.841">their missile they have nuclear tests</text>
  <text start="955.23" dur="3.419">they&amp;#39;re developing weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="957.18" dur="3.779">destruction we should go in there and</text>
  <text start="958.649" dur="5.49">stop them but this time it didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="960.959" dur="6.841">and they&amp;#39;re continually testing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="964.139" dur="6.121">developing they&amp;#39;re creating a nuclear</text>
  <text start="967.8" dur="5.719">bomb they&amp;#39;re creating a missile that</text>
  <text start="970.26" dur="5.25">could fly with a nuclear warhead on top</text>
  <text start="973.519" dur="5.021">if the Kabala</text>
  <text start="975.51" dur="5.55">was in control they would have gone into</text>
  <text start="978.54" dur="4.38">North Korea already now the only way</text>
  <text start="981.06" dur="4.259">they can get in there is to have some</text>
  <text start="982.92" dur="5.2">type of major event because at this</text>
  <text start="985.319" dur="4.571">point they can&amp;#39;t make their case they</text>
  <text start="988.12" dur="4.05">can&amp;#39;t go in front of Congress they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="989.89" dur="3.99">go in front of the American people and</text>
  <text start="992.17" dur="5.4">say let&amp;#39;s go in there because North</text>
  <text start="993.88" dur="8.25">Korea has done nothing and China and</text>
  <text start="997.57" dur="8.4">Russia are right there next to North</text>
  <text start="1002.13" dur="5.67">Korea and the United States is making a</text>
  <text start="1005.97" dur="6.45">big deal about this I should say the</text>
  <text start="1007.8" dur="6.39">Cabal the corporate media nikki Haley so</text>
  <text start="1012.42" dur="2.79">if they were going to do something they</text>
  <text start="1014.19" dur="4.05">would have done it already</text>
  <text start="1015.21" dur="5.79">you don&amp;#39;t wait until the country has the</text>
  <text start="1018.24" dur="5.25">nuclear weapons it makes no sense you do</text>
  <text start="1021" dur="6.15">it beforehand like they did with Iraq</text>
  <text start="1023.49" dur="6.089">with Libya and the rest so we can see</text>
  <text start="1027.15" dur="5.07">right now they have lost their window of</text>
  <text start="1029.579" dur="5.49">opportunity which means they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1032.22" dur="5.52">the power and the only thing they have</text>
  <text start="1035.069" dur="4.14">left is to create some type of major</text>
