  <text start="308.919" dur="8.56">Trump well he&amp;#39;s doing the exact opposite</text>
  <text start="313.749" dur="5.651">think about what he has done to push the</text>
  <text start="317.479" dur="3.62">economy in the right direction and we</text>
  <text start="319.4" dur="4.739">mentioned this many many times before</text>

  <text start="332.09" dur="6.509">this is being done on purpose and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="333.71" dur="9.569">using the entire money printing system</text>

  <text start="349.129" dur="5.88">against the people for a very long time</text>
  <text start="351.319" dur="7.43">and if you look during the time of Obama</text>
  <text start="355.009" dur="6.72">the national debt completely skyrocketed</text>
  <text start="358.749" dur="6.1">under Trump yes it&amp;#39;s moved up but not</text>
  <text start="361.729" dur="5.701">like Obama Trump is using the end stage</text>

  <text start="367.43" dur="4.229">America great again when I mean what I</text>
  <text start="369.529" dur="4.62">mean by that is he&amp;#39;s going to redo the</text>
  <text start="371.659" dur="5.701">infrastructure he&amp;#39;s going to build up</text>
  <text start="374.149" dur="6.211">the military he&amp;#39;s going to make sure</text>
  <text start="377.36" dur="4.44">that the businesses are coming back to</text>
  <text start="380.36" dur="4.169">the United States and the trade deals</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="4.799">that we have are incredible trade deals</text>
  <text start="384.529" dur="4.021">because once we come off this petro</text>
  <text start="386.599" dur="5.16">dollar system that the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.55" dur="7.44">created it&amp;#39;s going to be a whole new</text>

  <text start="705.96" dur="5.49">is what we want out of the economic</text>
  <text start="707.91" dur="7.02">trade deal trump is going to get what he</text>
  <text start="711.45" dur="5.76">wants and China to save face to get a</text>
  <text start="714.93" dur="4.98">better trade or a better economic</text>
  <text start="717.21" dur="5.16">outcome they&amp;#39;re going to say okay North</text>
  <text start="719.91" dur="6.81">Korea is going to be nuclear ice why is</text>
  <text start="722.37" dur="7.29">this because Trump has the upper hand US</text>
  <text start="726.72" dur="5.88">and Europe are much more important for</text>
  <text start="729.66" dur="5.82">China than China is for the US and</text>
  <text start="732.6" dur="5.99">Europe the u.s. is now actively</text>
  <text start="735.48" dur="5.55">contemplating the launch of mmt and</text>
  <text start="738.59" dur="4.21">exploding the u.s. twin deficit by</text>
  <text start="741.03" dur="5.07">issuing virtually unlimited amounts of</text>
  <text start="742.8" dur="5.58">debt which it ostensibly can do as long</text>
  <text start="746.1" dur="4.26">as the US dollar is the world&amp;#39;s reserve</text>
  <text start="748.38" dur="4.62">currency which it still is and remember</text>
  <text start="750.36" dur="4.44">Trump is using everything out of the</text>
  <text start="753" dur="3.18">Federal Reserve using everything the</text>
  <text start="754.8" dur="4.95">deep State the central banks have used</text>
  <text start="756.18" dur="9.45">in the past to make America great again</text>
  <text start="759.75" dur="8.58">and once Trump does this China will</text>
  <text start="765.63" dur="4.44">benefit why because China&amp;#39;s current</text>
  <text start="768.33" dur="3.81">account deficit will turn negative</text>
  <text start="770.07" dur="4.26">meaning that China will henceforth need</text>
  <text start="772.14" dur="5.46">financing from the rest of the world and</text>
  <text start="774.33" dur="6.03">specifically the u.s. it is not Beijing</text>
  <text start="777.6" dur="5.85">that has leverage over the US but rather</text>
  <text start="780.36" dur="5.22">the u.s. whose ability and desire to</text>
  <text start="783.45" dur="3.45">allocate capital to China could mean all</text>
  <text start="785.58" dur="4.8">the difference for China&amp;#39;s economic</text>
  <text start="786.9" dur="7.38">growth or lack thereof and when you look</text>
  <text start="790.38" dur="5.67">at it as the GDP numbers rise in Europe</text>
  <text start="794.28" dur="5.64">and the United States</text>
  <text start="796.05" dur="6.71">it helps China when China&amp;#39;s GDP Rises it</text>
  <text start="799.92" dur="6.24">does not help the United States and</text>
  <text start="802.76" dur="7.3">Europe so actually Europe and the United</text>
  <text start="806.16" dur="7.29">States they help China and China they</text>
  <text start="810.06" dur="5.4">understand this but again leaders of</text>
  <text start="813.45" dur="5.58">both country they want what they want</text>
  <text start="815.46" dur="6.84">Trump has played this perfectly played</text>
  <text start="819.03" dur="6.39">this so China well they have no place to</text>
  <text start="822.3" dur="5.97">go except to agree with what Trump is</text>
  <text start="825.42" dur="5">offering because Trump is just going to</text>
  <text start="828.27" dur="4.04">add more tariffs</text>
  <text start="830.42" dur="4.349">and is going to put pressure on China</text>
  <text start="832.31" dur="4.529">the cost does not come back to the</text>
  <text start="834.769" dur="5.791">people of the United States the cost is</text>
  <text start="836.839" dur="6.481">absorbed by China and they are taxed</text>
  <text start="840.56" dur="5.19">think about what Trump is doing Trump is</text>
  <text start="843.32" dur="3.629">telling the Federal Reserve not to raise</text>
  <text start="845.75" dur="3.149">interest rates they didn&amp;#39;t raise</text>
  <text start="846.949" dur="3.981">interest rates Trump is telling the</text>
  <text start="848.899" dur="4.74">Federal Reserve to cut interest rates</text>
  <text start="850.93" dur="5.019">most likely we&amp;#39;re going to see this we</text>
  <text start="853.639" dur="4.26">know the Federal Reserve well they</text>
  <text start="855.949" dur="5.64">stopped they&amp;#39;re going to stop winding</text>
  <text start="857.899" dur="6.3">down and they&amp;#39;re looking at a stimulus</text>
  <text start="861.589" dur="5.971">package once the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="864.199" dur="6.601">announces a stimulus package guess what</text>
  <text start="867.56" dur="7.35">all of a sudden all this money is going</text>
  <text start="870.8" dur="7.2">to flow into the United States and Trump</text>
  <text start="874.91" dur="6.15">is going to use this China understands</text>
  <text start="878" dur="5.279">this China realizes that they want a</text>
  <text start="881.06" dur="4.98">piece of this to keep their economic</text>
  <text start="883.279" dur="6.331">system going remember the plan before</text>
  <text start="886.04" dur="6.02">was to shift everything over to China to</text>
  <text start="889.61" dur="6.27">shift everything why do you think</text>
  <text start="892.06" dur="6.279">Clinton Biden and the rest were selling</text>
  <text start="895.88" dur="3.09">secrets to the Chinese bringing them up</text>
  <text start="898.339" dur="2.881">to speed</text>
  <text start="898.97" dur="5.25">bringing their technology up to speed</text>
  <text start="901.22" dur="6.54">and what we see happening right now is</text>
  <text start="904.22" dur="8.04">Trump is using all of this against China</text>
  <text start="907.76" dur="7.199">and China well they have no other place</text>
  <text start="912.26" dur="3.42">to go they&amp;#39;re going to have to do this</text>
  <text start="914.959" dur="4.171">because think about it</text>
  <text start="915.68" dur="5.73">the United States pushing more stimulus</text>
  <text start="919.13" dur="4.47">what do you think the ECB is going to do</text>
  <text start="921.41" dur="3.539">they&amp;#39;re going to push more stimulus now</text>
  <text start="923.6" dur="3.51">everyone&amp;#39;s saying well here we are we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.949" dur="4.681">back to where we started now Trump is</text>
  <text start="927.11" dur="3.96">not doing what all the other presidents</text>
  <text start="929.63" dur="3.36">have done what the deep state the</text>
  <text start="931.07" dur="4.62">central banks have done what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="932.99" dur="6.959">is he&amp;#39;s pushing the federal reserve into</text>

  <text start="939.949" dur="4.08">Federal Reserve is independent they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="942.17" dur="5.07">doing this on their own</text>

  <text start="950.6" dur="5.28">independent that can be politicized so</text>
  <text start="953.44" dur="4.629">Trump could lo they&amp;#39;re making sure that</text>
  <text start="955.88" dur="4.31">they are independent that&amp;#39;s the way the</text>
  <text start="958.069" dur="5.851">world sees them but behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="960.19" dur="8.019">they&amp;#39;re doing exactly what they want</text>
  <text start="963.92" dur="7.05">when the system overheats burns down who</text>
  <text start="968.209" dur="5.281">is to blame it&amp;#39;s the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="970.97" dur="5.809">remember they&amp;#39;re independent they made</text>
