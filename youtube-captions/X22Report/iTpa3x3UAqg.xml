  <text start="123.71" dur="3.839">steady it might be down a little bit</text>
  <text start="125.78" dur="4.83">might be a little bit up but really we</text>
  <text start="127.549" dur="7.111">haven&amp;#39;t seen any big moves and we can</text>
  <text start="130.61" dur="6.629">see right now they&amp;#39;re keeping everything</text>
  <text start="134.66" dur="6.329">on solid ground they don&amp;#39;t want anything</text>
  <text start="137.239" dur="6.931">to happen during this period and we know</text>
  <text start="140.989" dur="7.22">for a fact that this economy that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="144.17" dur="7.59">in well its continually collapsing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.209" dur="7.631">deteriorating its declining and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="7.02">starting to see more corporations more</text>
  <text start="155.84" dur="5.61">retail stores well they&amp;#39;re taking the</text>
  <text start="158.78" dur="4.53">hit we see the performance sports group</text>
  <text start="161.45" dur="5.4">the maker of Bower ice hockey equipment</text>
  <text start="163.31" dur="5.16">and Eastern baseball and softball gear</text>
  <text start="166.85" dur="5.1">they have filed for bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="168.47" dur="6.269">protection and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="171.95" dur="7.98">Sports Authority performance Sports</text>
  <text start="174.739" dur="7.95">Group we can see Aero pastel and</text>
  <text start="179.93" dur="7.559">many other retailers they are filing</text>
  <text start="182.689" dur="10.22">bankruptcy and the reason for all of</text>
  <text start="187.489" dur="8.761">this is because the weakening of</text>
  <text start="192.909" dur="4.871">consumer demand now many people say well</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="3.06">people don&amp;#39;t want to play ice hockey</text>
  <text start="197.78" dur="3.84">anymore people don&amp;#39;t want to buy</text>
  <text start="199.31" dur="7.319">clothing no what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="201.62" dur="8.869">is people do not have the discretionary</text>
  <text start="206.629" dur="7.23">funds to go out and purchase these goods</text>
  <text start="210.489" dur="5.17">this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing it happen to so</text>
  <text start="213.859" dur="5.041">many business now I can understand if</text>
  <text start="215.659" dur="5.851">there were certain products in a certain</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="4.11">store and they were very expensive and</text>
  <text start="221.51" dur="3.72">this was the only store that it happened</text>
  <text start="223.01" dur="6.479">to yes you can make the case that hey</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="6.509">people just aren&amp;#39;t interested the demand</text>
  <text start="229.489" dur="4.08">for this type of product is not there</text>
  <text start="231.739" dur="4.5">anymore but we&amp;#39;re seeing it with</text>
  <text start="233.569" dur="4.681">clothing we&amp;#39;re seeing it with shoes</text>
  <text start="236.239" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re seeing it with Sporting Goods</text>
  <text start="238.25" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re seeing it with many different</text>
  <text start="240.469" dur="4.501">things with people going out to eat and</text>
  <text start="242.78" dur="4.859">this shows us this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="244.97" dur="5.79">with what people want it&amp;#39;s what people</text>
  <text start="247.639" dur="5.551">can afford and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="5.52">as we move forward that things are</text>
  <text start="253.19" dur="6.78">really starting to deteriorate quite</text>
  <text start="256.28" dur="5.79">quickly now the powers ability neocons</text>
  <text start="259.97" dur="4.41">the elites the global is the central</text>
  <text start="262.07" dur="3.92">banks they can continually keep the</text>
  <text start="264.38" dur="5.599">illusion alive of course they can</text>
  <text start="265.99" dur="6.64">but we&amp;#39;re not looking at the manipulated</text>
  <text start="269.979" dur="5.921">indicators that they use we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="4.77">at the other economic indicators where</text>
  <text start="275.9" dur="4.5">they ever have a very tough time</text>
  <text start="277.4" dur="4.889">manipulating and all you have to do is</text>
  <text start="280.4" dur="3.6">go to the street and you can see that</text>
  <text start="282.289" dur="3.81">while that storage is closed</text>
  <text start="284" dur="3.9">oh that storage is closed and if you</text>
  <text start="286.099" dur="6.301">start to talk to people you realize that</text>
  <text start="287.9" dur="6.5">business is not doing as good as they</text>
  <text start="292.4" dur="5.549">make it out to it make it out to be</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="7.12">things are rapidly deteriorating we see</text>
  <text start="297.949" dur="6.381">real disposable income per capita slides</text>
  <text start="301.52" dur="5.639">for the second straight month and</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="5.32">personal income rose less than expected</text>
  <text start="307.159" dur="3.951">in September it was a point three</text>
  <text start="309.65" dur="3.46">percent versus a point four percent</text>
  <text start="311.11" dur="4.19">expectation</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="5.36">and thanks to a downward revision in</text>
  <text start="315.3" dur="7.89">August spending rose more than expected</text>
  <text start="318.47" dur="6.94">0.5% verse 8.4% and we can see that they</text>
  <text start="323.19" dur="3.87">continually revise these numbers they</text>
  <text start="325.41" dur="3.09">manipulate these numbers to get the</text>
  <text start="327.06" dur="5.52">numbers where they want and they</text>
  <text start="328.5" dur="6.84">continually do this and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="332.58" dur="6.47">actually looking at here which is most</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="7.59">notable is the decline in real</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="5.8">disposable income which declined to</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="4.53">thirty nine thousand ninety-two dollars</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="5.37">in September from thirty-nine thousand</text>
  <text start="347.46" dur="5.67">one hundred and seventeen in July and we</text>
  <text start="350.22" dur="7.02">are continually seeing this we&amp;#39;re real</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="8.58">disposable income is declining and this</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="8.42">is a major problem because as income</text>
  <text start="361.71" dur="7.26">declines people have less to spend as</text>
  <text start="365.66" dur="7.18">the value of the dollar declines we see</text>
  <text start="368.97" dur="7.14">prices go up so you have a declining</text>
  <text start="372.84" dur="6.27">wage prices going up something has to</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="4.62">break and what that is is people</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="5.04">actually going out and spending the</text>
  <text start="380.73" dur="4.77">money on goods and we&amp;#39;re seeing it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="3.51">seeing the restaurant Performance Index</text>
  <text start="385.5" dur="4.29">drop we&amp;#39;re seeing retail not looking</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="3.99">good we saw last year during the holiday</text>
  <text start="389.79" dur="3.42">season it was one of the worst holiday</text>
  <text start="391.65" dur="3.99">seasons that we&amp;#39;ve had and right after</text>
  <text start="393.21" dur="4.71">that we saw many many stores closed well</text>
  <text start="395.64" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing occur again</text>
  <text start="397.92" dur="5.79">and it&amp;#39;s not just going to go away</text>
  <text start="400.89" dur="6">they just can&amp;#39;t fix it the central bank</text>
  <text start="403.71" dur="7.59">the US government they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="406.89" dur="6.36">ability just to create jobs this the</text>
  <text start="411.3" dur="3.42">Federal Reserve the central banks they</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="2.58">don&amp;#39;t have the ability to say hey you</text>
  <text start="414.72" dur="4.32">know what we&amp;#39;re going to put everyone to</text>
  <text start="415.83" dur="5.7">work yes they can print currency and</text>
  <text start="419.04" dur="3.75">just pay everyone but that&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="421.53" dur="3.42">band-aid fix that&amp;#39;s not going to help</text>
  <text start="422.79" dur="4.5">yes in the short run people will feel</text>
  <text start="424.95" dur="5">better but in the long run it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="427.29" dur="6.3">break down it won&amp;#39;t go anywhere and</text>
  <text start="429.95" dur="5.5">people will get very upset and the</text>
  <text start="433.59" dur="5.4">country will stop manufacturing it just</text>
  <text start="435.45" dur="6.12">will not work and we&amp;#39;re seeing more</text>
  <text start="438.99" dur="5.16">indicators right now letting us know</text>

  <text start="492.889" dur="6.27">to break and we&amp;#39;re going to be heading</text>
  <text start="496" dur="6.4">downward just like we did in 2008 we see</text>

  <text start="564.709" dur="6.271">can see that we are heading down a path</text>
  <text start="567.41" dur="6.239">where we were back in August of 19th of</text>
  <text start="570.98" dur="6.359">2015 where all of a sudden the market</text>
  <text start="573.649" dur="6.331">dropped and the VIX shot up showing</text>

  <text start="579.98" dur="5.299">we&amp;#39;re almost at that point</text>
  <text start="581.05" dur="7.86">once again we are also seeing three</text>
  <text start="585.279" dur="7.471">major indicators letting us know there</text>
  <text start="588.91" dur="6.54">are major problems the globally bond</text>
  <text start="592.75" dur="5.16">yields are spiking with bond yields</text>
  <text start="595.45" dur="4.199">rising earning yields will follow the</text>
  <text start="597.91" dur="5.64">only way for earning yields to rise is</text>
  <text start="599.649" dur="6.301">for stock prices to fall long bond leads</text>
  <text start="603.55" dur="6.09">stocks to the upside this year well</text>
  <text start="605.95" dur="8">they&amp;#39;re now leading down the market is</text>
  <text start="609.64" dur="6.84">being held up by just five to six stocks</text>
  <text start="613.95" dur="4.75">the number of individual companies above</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="6.419">their 50-day moving average has been in</text>
  <text start="618.7" dur="8.52">a virtual freefall since February just a</text>
  <text start="622.899" dur="8.451">handful of companies remain kind of</text>
  <text start="627.22" dur="8.549">strong everything else is breaking down</text>
  <text start="631.35" dur="7.27">they&amp;#39;re becoming weaker and we can see</text>
  <text start="635.769" dur="7.051">right now that as this continually</text>
  <text start="638.62" dur="6.24">happens this is this market the economy</text>
  <text start="642.82" dur="5.04">and everything else is heading into a</text>
  <text start="644.86" dur="5.13">crisis mode now the third indicator</text>
  <text start="647.86" dur="5.58">shows us that we have major problems</text>
  <text start="649.99" dur="7.77">here because earnings have already</text>
  <text start="653.44" dur="6.389">collapsed right now to 2012 levels so</text>
  <text start="657.76" dur="7.889">stocks would need to crash over 25%</text>
  <text start="659.829" dur="8.461">double - below 1500 just to catch up so</text>
  <text start="665.649" dur="6.18">bond yields are spiking stock internals</text>
  <text start="668.29" dur="7.32">in a freefall earnings well they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="671.829" dur="5.461">severe collapse mode here and you know</text>
  <text start="675.61" dur="5.25">what&amp;#39;s very interesting we saw this</text>
  <text start="677.29" dur="8.34">before this is nothing new we saw this</text>
  <text start="680.86" dur="8.49">back in 2008 and it&amp;#39;s really starting to</text>
  <text start="685.63" dur="5.43">look like 2008 once again and we can see</text>
  <text start="689.35" dur="3.299">right now from all the economic</text>
  <text start="691.06" dur="4.86">indicators from everything that we look</text>
  <text start="692.649" dur="5.37">at we can see that the economy guess</text>
  <text start="695.92" dur="6.109">what it&amp;#39;s being propped up there trying</text>
  <text start="698.019" dur="7.921">to hold it together because this is</text>
  <text start="702.029" dur="6.49">prepared and ready to collapse now again</text>
  <text start="705.94" dur="5.899">they want to collapse this on their own</text>
  <text start="708.519" dur="5.491">terms they want everything in place and</text>
  <text start="711.839" dur="3.071">we can see we&amp;#39;re coming up to the</text>
  <text start="714.01" dur="3.08">elections</text>
  <text start="714.91" dur="4.53">and depending on what happens here</text>
  <text start="717.09" dur="4.63">that&amp;#39;s going to depend on when they</text>
  <text start="719.44" dur="3.72">bring the economy down because when we</text>
  <text start="721.72" dur="3.75">look out into the Middle East the petro</text>
  <text start="723.16" dur="5.82">dollar we see that is under threat right</text>
  <text start="725.47" dur="6.63">now they realize that they&amp;#39;re stuck they</text>
