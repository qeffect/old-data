  <text start="35.15" dur="5.19">episode 891 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="37.43" dur="5.19">februari 11th 2016 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="40.34" dur="4.26">the episode is the market is starting to</text>
  <text start="42.62" dur="4.47">crack under the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="44.6" dur="5.52">pressure let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="47.09" dur="6.63">economic collapse financial news well we</text>
  <text start="50.12" dur="6.54">are seeing that the market fluctuations</text>
  <text start="53.72" dur="5.13">are continuing we see that the market</text>
  <text start="56.66" dur="5.43">was down quite a bit today they pumped</text>
  <text start="58.85" dur="8.909">it up to about 250 so points and we see</text>
  <text start="62.09" dur="7.44">gold surging to new highs and we need to</text>
  <text start="67.759" dur="3.72">be very careful about what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="69.53" dur="5.16">right now we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="71.479" dur="4.89">entire economic system crumble apart and</text>
  <text start="74.69" dur="4.289">fall apart because more and more people</text>
  <text start="76.369" dur="5.64">are becoming awakened to what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="78.979" dur="6.871">happening here and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="82.009" dur="5.701">going to be running to the exits and I</text>
  <text start="85.85" dur="6.24">know a lot of people are saying wow gold</text>
  <text start="87.71" dur="7.219">has gone up it&amp;#39;s skyrocketing and a lot</text>
  <text start="92.09" dur="5.4">of financial pundants and a lot of</text>
  <text start="94.929" dur="4.3">others are out there saying wow this is</text>
  <text start="97.49" dur="4.5">going to go skyrocketing at this point</text>
  <text start="99.229" dur="5.911">I&amp;#39;m thinking the opposite at this time</text>
  <text start="101.99" dur="6.84">because we need to think about what the</text>
  <text start="105.14" dur="6.929">central bankers are trying to do here</text>
  <text start="108.83" dur="7.62">they are trying to keep the economy</text>
  <text start="112.069" dur="9.33">propped up because they cannot have it</text>
  <text start="116.45" dur="8.699">come down just yet and if gold surges to</text>
  <text start="121.399" dur="8.491">new highs at this point this would be a</text>
  <text start="125.149" dur="8.761">problem so most likely we are going to</text>
  <text start="129.89" dur="6.48">see a flash crash of some sort either</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="4.799">maybe tomorrow or the beginning of next</text>
  <text start="136.37" dur="5.85">week which will bring gold back down</text>
  <text start="138.709" dur="5.041">twenty thirty forty dollars and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="142.22" dur="3.18">going to be a lot of paper contracts</text>
  <text start="143.75" dur="3.75">that are going to be thrown on to this</text>
  <text start="145.4" dur="4.38">and most likely it will be brought down</text>
  <text start="147.5" dur="6.09">let&amp;#39;s see if this actually happens</text>
  <text start="149.78" dur="6.179">because if they do do this we know that</text>
  <text start="153.59" dur="4.02">this is completely manipulated we know</text>
  <text start="155.959" dur="5.01">that they&amp;#39;re not ready to bring down the</text>
  <text start="157.61" dur="4.739">economy we know at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="160.969" dur="3.061">going to try to keep this going for a</text>
  <text start="162.349" dur="6.36">little bit longer if</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="7.41">Gold continually Rises and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="168.709" dur="5.131">slow it down no matter what they do if</text>
  <text start="171.44" dur="4.68">they do the flash crash and it</text>
  <text start="173.84" dur="5.4">continually goes up we know at this</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="4.41">point that this system is coming down</text>
  <text start="179.24" dur="3.41">because what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="5.82">everyone&amp;#39;s going to be looking at gold</text>
  <text start="182.65" dur="5.35">they&amp;#39;re going to see it rising and a lot</text>
  <text start="186.35" dur="4.32">of people are going to be taking their</text>
  <text start="188" dur="5.88">funds out of the stock market out of the</text>
  <text start="190.67" dur="5.789">banks and piling it into gold and this</text>
  <text start="193.88" dur="7.02">will just accelerate as time goes on</text>
  <text start="196.459" dur="6.081">remember the Fed gave us the signal when</text>
  <text start="200.9" dur="5.61">they raised the interest rates by 25</text>
  <text start="202.54" dur="8.86">basis point letting us know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="6.949">prepared to bring down this economy this</text>
  <text start="211.4" dur="5.19">was the signal even though the other</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="6.491">countries and the other central banks</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="7.53">were going negative we see the United</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="7.77">States where was showing and forcing the</text>
  <text start="224.12" dur="4.649">issue that we were in a recovery so</text>
  <text start="227.72" dur="3.03">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this</text>
  <text start="228.769" dur="4.291">situation very very carefully but we see</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="6.12">the market at this point it is</text>
  <text start="233.06" dur="5.76">completely falling apart and when we</text>
  <text start="236.87" dur="4.47">look around the globe we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="238.82" dur="5.58">realize that everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="241.34" dur="6">talking about all of these economic</text>
  <text start="244.4" dur="9.45">indicators global trade the Baltic Dry</text>

  <text start="253.85" dur="8.189">manipulation of statistics unemployment</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="6.731">you name it it is all pointing to one</text>
  <text start="262.039" dur="6.121">thing and one thing only and that is a</text>
  <text start="264.53" dur="7.009">major economic crisis which we will be</text>
  <text start="268.16" dur="6.81">seeing now the initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="271.539" dur="8.011">came out and the initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="274.97" dur="8.699">they dropped last week from 285 to 269</text>
  <text start="279.55" dur="7.17">269 thousand and goldman is out there</text>
  <text start="283.669" dur="5.661">saying there is only a limited evidence</text>
  <text start="286.72" dur="6.03">that the rising claims is due to</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="6.1">distress in the energy sector and</text>
  <text start="292.75" dur="5.099">continuing claims drop modestly to about</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="5.739">2.2 39 million</text>
  <text start="297.849" dur="6">goldman adds the persistence of the</text>
  <text start="301.169" dur="4.87">recent move suggests more might be going</text>
  <text start="303.849" dur="4.68">on and we are treating the increase as</text>
  <text start="306.039" dur="6.6">more than just noise the trend of</text>
  <text start="308.529" dur="8.28">initial jobless claims is on the upward</text>
  <text start="312.639" dur="5.82">trend we&amp;#39;ve hit the bottom in September</text>
  <text start="316.809" dur="3.241">they&amp;#39;ve done all their manipulation</text>
  <text start="318.459" dur="4.621">they&amp;#39;ve done whatever they possibly</text>
  <text start="320.05" dur="6.239">could and we see that initial jobless</text>
  <text start="323.08" dur="4.859">claims dropped a little bit and because</text>
  <text start="326.289" dur="2.97">they dropped a little bit we see the</text>
  <text start="327.939" dur="2.9">corporate media is out there and of</text>
  <text start="329.259" dur="5.16">course being pushed by the US government</text>
  <text start="330.839" dur="10.6">saying that since initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="334.419" dur="10.89">are low this shows no sign of rising</text>
  <text start="341.439" dur="7.2">layoffs really no signs of layoffs</text>
  <text start="345.309" dur="5.4">whatsoever as of december to january</text>
  <text start="348.639" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;re up two hundred eighteen percent in</text>

  <text start="844.36" dur="5.789">is completely falling apart now a lot of</text>
  <text start="847.72" dur="5.16">countries are going negative interest</text>

  <text start="860.5" dur="8.16">doing whatever they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="863.95" dur="6.78">this system alive and you know what this</text>

  <text start="883.69" dur="5.519">want you to they want you to take it and</text>
  <text start="885.88" dur="5.28">put it into the stock market but most</text>
  <text start="889.209" dur="5.971">people are taking it out of the banks</text>
  <text start="891.16" dur="7.08">and keeping it because they&amp;#39;re nervous</text>
  <text start="895.18" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re scared Yellen is discussing</text>
  <text start="898.24" dur="5.82">negative rates in a congressional</text>
  <text start="899.89" dur="8.96">testimony and we know that ECB Sweden</text>
  <text start="904.06" dur="7.769">Japan Switzerland have all done this and</text>
  <text start="908.85" dur="6.04">we see they have no clue at this point</text>
  <text start="911.829" dur="7.221">of what to do as the economy falls apart</text>
  <text start="914.89" dur="7.47">remember they want a controlled collapse</text>
  <text start="919.05" dur="5.26">they want to make sure that they have</text>
  <text start="922.36" dur="3.539">the ability to bring it down when they</text>
  <text start="924.31" dur="5.19">want to bring it down they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="925.899" dur="6.81">outside forces coming in and destroying</text>
  <text start="929.5" dur="5.279">what they want to do here because as we</text>
  <text start="932.709" dur="5.25">know they don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for</text>
  <text start="934.779" dur="4.62">what is going to happen here and this is</text>
  <text start="937.959" dur="2.94">why they&amp;#39;re going to try to prop it up</text>
  <text start="939.399" dur="4.171">as best they can they&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="940.899" dur="3.841">negative interest rates they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="943.57" dur="3.329">push the markets up they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="944.74" dur="4.11">slam gold down there going to try all</text>
  <text start="946.899" dur="6.651">these different things to keep everyone</text>
  <text start="948.85" dur="6.57">in the dark that everything is okay and</text>
  <text start="953.55" dur="4.06">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch these</text>
  <text start="955.42" dur="4.89">situations very carefully now something</text>
  <text start="957.61" dur="7.18">very interesting we know that the Zika</text>
  <text start="960.31" dur="8.04">virus is being hyped up pushed out</text>
  <text start="964.79" dur="6.59">they&amp;#39;re that it causes microcephaly and</text>
  <text start="968.35" dur="5.56">I see in the corporate media already</text>
  <text start="971.38" dur="8.64">they&amp;#39;re trying to shift the focus now</text>
  <text start="973.91" dur="10.98">saying the economy might get weaker</text>
  <text start="980.02" dur="7.57">because of the Zika virus because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="984.89" dur="5.67">happening in all of these countries and</text>
  <text start="987.59" dur="5.31">this might affect the economy I mean</text>
  <text start="990.56" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="992.9" dur="3.81">to explain away why this is happening</text>
  <text start="995.54" dur="5.79">right now because you have to remember</text>
  <text start="996.71" dur="9.24">for the last eight years the central</text>
  <text start="1001.33" dur="8.15">bank the Fed the US government has been</text>
  <text start="1005.95" dur="6.45">pushing the meme that we&amp;#39;ve recovered</text>
  <text start="1009.48" dur="5.74">we&amp;#39;re fine unemployment&amp;#39;s down to four</text>
  <text start="1012.4" dur="5.46">point nine percent we have a very strong</text>
  <text start="1015.22" dur="5.49">economy the stock market&amp;#39;s up there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1017.86" dur="4.55">nothing to worry about I mean added this</text>
  <text start="1020.71" dur="4.53">to edit the state of the union address</text>
  <text start="1022.41" dur="7.08">Obama was telling us that the economy is</text>
  <text start="1025.24" dur="7.83">absolutely perfect but we know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1029.49" dur="6.94">we know it&amp;#39;s falling apart we know</text>
  <text start="1033.07" dur="5.58">things are getting worse and this is why</text>
  <text start="1036.43" dur="5.48">we&amp;#39;re looking at indicators we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1038.65" dur="7.74">looking at every aspect of the economy</text>
  <text start="1041.91" dur="6.22">to give us a picture of what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1046.39" dur="4.38">going on because you know the corporate</text>
  <text start="1048.13" dur="4.89">media the government they&amp;#39;re never going</text>
  <text start="1050.77" dur="3.84">to tell you what&amp;#39;s going on all they do</text>
  <text start="1053.02" dur="4.47">is look at the stock market all day long</text>
  <text start="1054.61" dur="4.17">and anyone that comes up that tells you</text>
  <text start="1057.49" dur="5.1">that you know something there&amp;#39;s problems</text>
  <text start="1058.78" dur="5.7">something&amp;#39;s wrong retails closing they</text>
  <text start="1062.59" dur="5.58">pretend that that person is a crazy</text>
  <text start="1064.48" dur="5.6">person and the government and the</text>
  <text start="1068.17" dur="6.09">corporate media will continue</text>
  <text start="1070.08" dur="7.96">continually keep this illusion alive</text>
  <text start="1074.26" dur="7.34">until the very very end and at that</text>
  <text start="1078.04" dur="7.71">point it is going to be too late for</text>
  <text start="1081.6" dur="6.88">everyone and I just want to make sure</text>
  <text start="1085.75" dur="5.01">that everyone realizes at this point and</text>
  <text start="1088.48" dur="4.47">if you&amp;#39;ve been following all these</text>
  <text start="1090.76" dur="4.14">reports and all those people that have</text>
  <text start="1092.95" dur="5.04">been sending me things putting the</text>
  <text start="1094.9" dur="7.05">picture together here we realize that</text>
  <text start="1097.99" dur="6.569">this economy cannot be sustained the way</text>
  <text start="1101.95" dur="6.3">it is right now it&amp;#39;s not a people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1104.559" dur="7.711">economy it&amp;#39;s a central bank economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1108.25" dur="6.89">a government illusionary economy and it</text>
  <text start="1112.27" dur="6.539">will collapse just like it did in 2008</text>
  <text start="1115.14" dur="6.37">remember they told us back then that</text>
  <text start="1118.809" dur="5.521">everything was going to be fine and if</text>
  <text start="1121.51" dur="5.07">you listen to them and you went out and</text>
  <text start="1124.33" dur="5.849">you purchase a home right before it</text>
  <text start="1126.58" dur="7.92">collapsed you went out and you purchased</text>
  <text start="1130.179" dur="8.281">a new car or you took out a loan guess</text>
  <text start="1134.5" dur="7.29">what you have problems afterwards that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1138.46" dur="5.49">why we saw people leaving their homes in</text>
  <text start="1141.79" dur="3.84">California this is why we see</text>
  <text start="1143.95" dur="5.37">foreclosures this is why we saw short</text>
  <text start="1145.63" dur="8.58">sales this is why the economy fell apart</text>
  <text start="1149.32" dur="8.64">in 2008 that was actually the collapse</text>
  <text start="1154.21" dur="6.84">of the economy but what they did was</text>
  <text start="1157.96" dur="5.55">they blew it back up with this money</text>
  <text start="1161.05" dur="5.73">printing with manipulating statistical</text>
  <text start="1163.51" dur="4.65">numbers to keep the system alive a</text>
  <text start="1166.78" dur="4.44">little bit longer and what have they</text>
  <text start="1168.16" dur="5.58">been doing all this time well yes we</text>
  <text start="1171.22" dur="4.74">know they&amp;#39;ve been moving military assets</text>
  <text start="1173.74" dur="5.63">around the world preparing for a major</text>
  <text start="1175.96" dur="6.57">event but they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for</text>
  <text start="1179.37" dur="7.12">when this system comes down they took</text>
  <text start="1182.53" dur="5.7">the time to make extra preps to make</text>
  <text start="1186.49" dur="4.939">sure they were prepared for what it was</text>

  <text start="1202.21" dur="4.92">to be a lot worse than the first one</text>
  <text start="1204.73" dur="6.02">this one is going to affect all those</text>
  <text start="1207.13" dur="8.22">people that weren&amp;#39;t affected this one is</text>
  <text start="1210.75" dur="7.27">going to completely implode everything</text>
