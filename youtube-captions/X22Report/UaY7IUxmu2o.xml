  <text start="33.719" dur="4.201">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="6.419">episode 939 a and today&amp;#39;s data is april</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="6.5">7 2016 and total the episode is the</text>
  <text start="41.399" dur="5.611">economic recovery mirage is fading fast</text>
  <text start="44.42" dur="5.56">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="6.81">collapse financial news now today we see</text>
  <text start="49.98" dur="6.03">the market is down gold is back up and</text>
  <text start="53.82" dur="5.309">once again we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="5.33">market fluctuate quite a bit and we can</text>
  <text start="59.129" dur="5.041">see that this is going to continually</text>
  <text start="61.34" dur="5.889">happen as we move throughout this year</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="5.28">and most likely will see more down</text>
  <text start="67.229" dur="3.961">markets than up markets but they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="69.45" dur="5.97">continually try to push the market up</text>
  <text start="71.19" dur="5.97">again gold as we see it move up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="75.42" dur="3.39">going to be harder and harder for the US</text>
  <text start="77.16" dur="4.17">government central bankers to suppress</text>
  <text start="78.81" dur="6.119">the gold and we&amp;#39;re going to see higher</text>
  <text start="81.33" dur="5.069">lows and higher highs as we move forward</text>
  <text start="84.929" dur="4.23">so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch that very</text>
  <text start="86.399" dur="5.58">very carefully because as we see gold</text>
  <text start="89.159" dur="5.221">move up by fifty seventy eighty dollars</text>
  <text start="91.979" dur="5.911">maybe even a hundred and they try to</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="5.43">suppress it by you know 20 30 40 50 we</text>
  <text start="97.89" dur="3.57">need to look at this because this is an</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="4.769">indicator that they are losing control</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="5.31">gold is pushing up as more and more</text>
  <text start="104.579" dur="4.5">people see this they&amp;#39;re going to scratch</text>
  <text start="106.77" dur="3.75">their head and say hey maybe I should be</text>
  <text start="109.079" dur="3.781">buying some gold right now and that will</text>
  <text start="110.52" dur="4.379">push the market up even further so this</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="3.719">is something we need to watch now the</text>
  <text start="114.899" dur="6.481">economy here in the United States is</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="8.671">continually falling apart the mirage its</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="6.269">fading away and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="125.25" dur="5.459">initial jobless claims for three</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="5.15">consecutive weeks we had an increase but</text>
  <text start="130.709" dur="4.881">remember they&amp;#39;re manipulating</text>
  <text start="132.799" dur="4.901">unemployment so they need to manipulate</text>
  <text start="135.59" dur="4.45">initial jobless claims because it would</text>
  <text start="137.7" dur="4.02">make any sense let&amp;#39;s see unemployment is</text>
  <text start="140.04" dur="4.47">down to five percent it was at four</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="6.03">point nine percent at one period but</text>
  <text start="144.51" dur="4.5">initial jobless claims are rising people</text>
  <text start="147.75" dur="3.9">would scratch their heads and say this</text>
  <text start="149.01" dur="4.979">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense this can&amp;#39;t be so what</text>
  <text start="151.65" dur="4.26">they do is they manipulate all of these</text>
  <text start="153.989" dur="3.181">numbers because they need it to</text>
  <text start="155.91" dur="3.21">correspond but it&amp;#39;s getting more and</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="5.249">more difficult as time goes on because</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="4.949">as we know there are continual layoffs</text>
  <text start="162.419" dur="3.721">occurring it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="164.069" dur="5.25">we just laid off a hundred people we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.14" dur="6.929">seeing tens of thousands of people being</text>
  <text start="169.319" dur="7.411">laid off continuing claims they are</text>
  <text start="173.069" dur="5.28">rising they have jumped and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="176.73" dur="5.159">to see them continually manipulate these</text>
  <text start="178.349" dur="6.03">numbers until the very end and when we</text>
  <text start="181.889" dur="6.031">look at the chart of unemployment the</text>
  <text start="184.379" dur="8.821">initial jobless claims we can see how it</text>
  <text start="187.92" dur="6.929">follows the line of their story because</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="5.909">they need it to be this way to keep the</text>
  <text start="194.849" dur="7.381">illusion alive now very interestingly we</text>
  <text start="199.109" dur="4.5">talked about bubbles everywhere we know</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="3.509">there&amp;#39;s a real estate bubble we know</text>
  <text start="203.609" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;s a student loan bubble auto loan</text>
  <text start="205.739" dur="6.18">bubble Treasury bond bubble derivatives</text>
  <text start="208.199" dur="6.24">bubble and very interestingly everyone</text>
  <text start="211.919" dur="4.951">keeps talking about you know how there</text>
  <text start="214.439" dur="3.571">are so many jobs out there and of course</text>
  <text start="216.87" dur="3.269">this is coming from the corporate media</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="3.899">the US government central bankers and we</text>
  <text start="220.139" dur="4.141">talked about the opposite how there are</text>
  <text start="221.909" dur="5.821">no jobs out there that this is a</text>
  <text start="224.28" dur="5.31">complete illusion and people are sending</text>
  <text start="227.73" dur="3.119">out resumes getting no response a lot of</text>
  <text start="229.59" dur="4.289">people looking at it and saying there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.849" dur="4.95">no place to send my resume now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.879" dur="3.39">telling everyone to go back to school to</text>
  <text start="235.799" dur="3.06">get an education because once you get</text>
  <text start="237.269" dur="3.541">that education you can come out of</text>
  <text start="238.859" dur="4.231">school and you can get a job but what</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="6.03">we&amp;#39;re finding out is that many of the</text>
  <text start="243.09" dur="5.669">graduates today can&amp;#39;t find this job so</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="3.989">they&amp;#39;re living with their parents taking</text>
  <text start="248.759" dur="4.47">on whatever part time job they have and</text>
  <text start="250.829" dur="4.711">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to pay back their</text>
  <text start="253.229" dur="5.13">student loans well what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="6.77">right now is that forty percent of those</text>
  <text start="258.359" dur="6.09">students they stopped making payments</text>
  <text start="262.31" dur="5.38">actually many of them have never even</text>
  <text start="264.449" dur="5.041">made a payment and the Department of</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="5.4">Education they can&amp;#39;t figure out why this</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="7.35">is happening about one in six borrowers</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="6.06">or 3.6 million were in default on 56</text>
  <text start="276.84" dur="4.859">billion in student debt meaning they had</text>
  <text start="279.15" dur="4.92">gone at least a year without making a</text>
  <text start="281.699" dur="4.411">payment well there are others that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="284.07" dur="4.379">gone three months six months but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="4.559">not counted yet in this three million</text>
  <text start="288.449" dur="6.181">more owing roughly sixty six billion</text>
  <text start="290.669" dur="7.171">we&amp;#39;re at least a month behind meantime</text>
  <text start="294.63" dur="6.87">another three million owing almost 110</text>
  <text start="297.84" dur="5.39">were in forbearance or deferment meaning</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="6.09">they have received permission to</text>
  <text start="303.23" dur="6.64">temporarily halt payments now one of the</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="6.45">ways you can do this is to say I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="309.87" dur="6.89">unemployed right now now the event Corp</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="6">which services the student loans and</text>
  <text start="316.76" dur="5.98">offers like different payment plans tied</text>
  <text start="320.04" dur="6.45">to income saying that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="322.74" dur="7.01">reach these borrowers about 230 to 300</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="6.72">times two letters emails texts calls</text>
  <text start="329.75" dur="7.03">anyway they possibly can and ninety</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="7.64">percent of the borrower&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="336.78" dur="6.3">respond and they don&amp;#39;t make payments and</text>
  <text start="340.85" dur="3.94">they&amp;#39;re scratching their heads trying to</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="4.41">figure out I don&amp;#39;t understand the</text>
  <text start="344.79" dur="3.87">economy strong there&amp;#39;s plenty of jobs</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="4.08">out there that&amp;#39;s what the government</text>
  <text start="348.66" dur="6.78">telling us why can&amp;#39;t these people pay</text>
  <text start="351.57" dur="8.46">their loans well when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="355.44" dur="8.22">realize that guess what there are no</text>
  <text start="360.03" dur="6.84">jobs this is just another indicator</text>
  <text start="363.66" dur="4.379">showing us that if everything was fine</text>
  <text start="366.87" dur="3.9">and the government was telling us the</text>
  <text start="368.039" dur="5.461">truth people coming out of college would</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="7.94">have these incredible paying jobs but</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="8.21">they don&amp;#39;t so they&amp;#39;re not finding jobs</text>
  <text start="378.71" dur="7.05">they&amp;#39;re not paying back their loans and</text>
  <text start="381.71" dur="6.61">guess what they can&amp;#39;t file bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="385.76" dur="3.7">with student loans so this is a problem</text>
  <text start="388.32" dur="5.51">it&amp;#39;s stuck with them for the rest of</text>
  <text start="389.46" dur="8.78">their lives and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="393.83" dur="8.559">that this bubble this student bubble</text>
  <text start="398.24" dur="6.67">it&amp;#39;s going to pop because one the</text>
  <text start="402.389" dur="6.541">students and we see the numbers forty</text>
  <text start="404.91" dur="8.009">percent already as this grows the US</text>
  <text start="408.93" dur="7.739">will not be able to collect on trillions</text>
  <text start="412.919" dur="6.12">of dollars because as we can see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.669" dur="6.741">getting harder and harder for people to</text>
  <text start="419.039" dur="6.721">find work it&amp;#39;s not getting better at all</text>
  <text start="423.41" dur="4.8">now last time we talked about class</text>
  <text start="425.76" dur="4.32">eight trucking and we talked about how</text>
  <text start="428.21" dur="3.49">going back to the beginning of this year</text>
  <text start="430.08" dur="4.77">it was down forty-eight percent</text>
  <text start="431.7" dur="6.39">in truck orders but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="434.85" dur="9">right now is that the class 8 truck</text>
  <text start="438.09" dur="8.25">dater went from bad to worse orders for</text>
  <text start="443.85" dur="4.74">new big rigs plunged and inventories of</text>
  <text start="446.34" dur="4.79">unsold trucks or to their highest levels</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="8.22">since just before the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="451.13" dur="9.33">about 67,000 class 8 trucks are sitting</text>
  <text start="456.81" dur="7.41">on dealer lots completely unsold and</text>
  <text start="460.46" dur="7.26">what we see right now is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="464.22" dur="5.43">seeing class a truck new net orders</text>
  <text start="467.72" dur="5.14">declining since the beginning of this</text>
  <text start="469.65" dur="7.68">year not improving whatsoever now if we</text>
  <text start="472.86" dur="6.75">look at us railroads they are down by 13</text>
  <text start="477.33" dur="5.67">points seven percent from the same point</text>
  <text start="479.61" dur="7.2">of last year and their car loads</text>
  <text start="483" dur="9.15">containers trailers deliveries they are</text>
  <text start="486.81" dur="7.86">all down this tells us at this point</text>
  <text start="492.15" dur="6.9">that there&amp;#39;s no rebound in economic</text>
  <text start="494.67" dur="7.17">growth everything is slowing down we</text>
  <text start="499.05" dur="6.11">look at corporations we see their</text>
  <text start="501.84" dur="7.14">earnings this year are completely a</text>
  <text start="505.16" dur="5.74">gigantic disaster they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="508.98" dur="4.499">laying off people they&amp;#39;re buying back</text>
  <text start="510.9" dur="5.69">their stock pushing the stock market up</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="7.471">and sales revenue and everything else is</text>
  <text start="516.59" dur="8.23">declining this is not a recovery this is</text>
  <text start="520.95" dur="6.99">a complete disaster now Puerto Rico as</text>
  <text start="524.82" dur="5.55">we mentioned yesterday decided to create</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="5.93">legislation where they are not going to</text>
  <text start="530.37" dur="6">pay back any of the debt right now and</text>
  <text start="533.87" dur="7.17">right now we see that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="8.19">be implementing capital controls to</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="6.25">restrict the outflow of cash and to try</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="7.23">to stabilize the entire economy there</text>
  <text start="547.29" dur="8.04">and the situation in Puerto Rico is</text>
  <text start="551.79" dur="7.02">getting Messier and Messier each and</text>
  <text start="555.33" dur="6.09">every day and this really looks like</text>
  <text start="558.81" dur="5.73">what has happened in Greece and Cyprus</text>
  <text start="561.42" dur="4.17">and Europe and now it&amp;#39;s spreading over</text>
  <text start="564.54" dur="3.51">here in the United State</text>
  <text start="565.59" dur="4.98">and we have many different states that</text>
  <text start="568.05" dur="8.34">are in the same place where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.57" dur="7.62">teetering on a complete default and most</text>
  <text start="576.39" dur="3.87">likely looking at capital controls and</text>
  <text start="578.19" dur="5.22">we were going to see we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="580.26" dur="5.6">this happen as time goes on because what</text>
  <text start="583.41" dur="6.57">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a complete</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="6.4">implosion of the system now yes the</text>
  <text start="589.98" dur="5.13">central bank are is going to continually</text>
  <text start="592.26" dur="4.74">try to prop the system up they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="595.11" dur="3.93">to do whatever they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="597" dur="4.86">the illusion alive that everything is</text>
  <text start="599.04" dur="5.13">fine but when we really look at the</text>
  <text start="601.86" dur="6.21">situation and we look at the real</text>
  <text start="604.17" dur="8.37">economic indicators we see that whatever</text>
  <text start="608.07" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;re telling us can&amp;#39;t be true now if</text>
  <text start="612.54" dur="4.89">we only look at the stock market we can</text>
  <text start="614.82" dur="6">say oh okay yeah everything looks good</text>
  <text start="617.43" dur="7.73">but if you look at everything else that</text>
  <text start="620.82" dur="7.08">makes up the entire economy you realize</text>
  <text start="625.16" dur="5.34">the entire system is crashing at this</text>
  <text start="627.9" dur="6.48">point the same thing happened in 1929</text>
  <text start="630.5" dur="6.61">2001 2008 stock market was hitting</text>
  <text start="634.38" dur="5.85">all-time new highs and behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="637.11" dur="7.44">in the cover of night everything was</text>
  <text start="640.23" dur="6.18">falling apart but of course nobody wants</text>
  <text start="644.55" dur="4.95">to go there until that day when</text>
  <text start="646.41" dur="5.64">everything comes to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="649.5" dur="5.81">now out in Japan the finance ministry</text>
  <text start="652.05" dur="7.89">plans to increase the number of 10,000</text>
  <text start="655.31" dur="6.37">yen bills in circulation because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="659.94" dur="2.91">looking at what is going on here we know</text>
  <text start="661.68" dur="5.22">there are negative interest rates and</text>
  <text start="662.85" dur="6.72">more and more people are hoarding cash</text>
  <text start="666.9" dur="4.83">right now and the total amount of cash</text>
  <text start="669.57" dur="5.31">stash at home is estimated to have</text>
  <text start="671.73" dur="5.94">surged by nearly 5 trillion yen to some</text>
  <text start="674.88" dur="5.79">40 trillion yen in the past year and</text>
  <text start="677.67" dur="4.73">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s just Japan think about</text>
  <text start="680.67" dur="5.28">it if there&amp;#39;s negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="682.4" dur="5.98">why would you keep your currency in the</text>
  <text start="685.95" dur="5.19">bank it makes no sense to do so because</text>
  <text start="688.38" dur="4.17">you end up paying them and we know in</text>
  <text start="691.14" dur="2.58">all the other areas throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="692.55" dur="6.4">where there&amp;#39;s negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="693.72" dur="7.69">the people are doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="698.95" dur="5.57">and they should be because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="701.41" dur="5.64">reason to keep your currency in the bank</text>
  <text start="704.52" dur="3.85">now we have other reasons to keep the</text>
  <text start="707.05" dur="3.45">currency out of the bank because we know</text>
  <text start="708.37" dur="3.96">the balance are coming we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="710.5" dur="3">going to be locking down the banks we</text>
  <text start="712.33" dur="3.78">know there&amp;#39;s going to be capital</text>
  <text start="713.5" dur="5.16">controls and you will not be able to get</text>
  <text start="716.11" dur="3.93">whatever you have in there out and this</text>
  <text start="718.66" dur="3.42">is why we&amp;#39;ve been saying that everyone</text>
  <text start="720.04" dur="4.41">needs to be prepared for what is coming</text>
  <text start="722.08" dur="4.23">you should keep cash on hand of course</text>
  <text start="724.45" dur="4.07">don&amp;#39;t tell anyone where it is but you</text>
  <text start="726.31" dur="5.01">should also keep gold and silver on hand</text>
  <text start="728.52" dur="5.83">could be junk silver or copper or</text>
  <text start="731.32" dur="8.19">anything else that has value that you</text>
  <text start="734.35" dur="7.56">can trade later on and everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="739.51" dur="5.76">look at their situation and say okay if</text>
  <text start="741.91" dur="5.79">I have a hundred in cash is that enough</text>
  <text start="745.27" dur="4.71">if I have 200 in cash is that enough if</text>
  <text start="747.7" dur="5.19">I have whatever amount is that enough</text>
  <text start="749.98" dur="5.82">from when the system completely falls</text>
  <text start="752.89" dur="6.03">apart because as we know when everything</text>
  <text start="755.8" dur="5.91">starts to rapidly fall apart most likely</text>
  <text start="758.92" dur="5.37">we will see inflation where the cost of</text>
  <text start="761.71" dur="5.82">goods will continually rise well</text>
  <text start="764.29" dur="6.5">actually the value of your currency will</text>
  <text start="767.53" dur="7.32">fall and I&amp;#39;ll make it look like that the</text>
  <text start="770.79" dur="7.3">prices of products are increasing so we</text>
  <text start="774.85" dur="5.79">need to include that in our calculation</text>
  <text start="778.09" dur="5.31">of what you&amp;#39;ll actually need and if you</text>
  <text start="780.64" dur="5.88">have gold and silver those are just</text>
  <text start="783.4" dur="6.75">going to rise as time goes on it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="786.52" dur="5.34">insurance policy so this is why everyone</text>
  <text start="790.15" dur="4.17">has been saying listen keep these things</text>

  <text start="794.32" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t forget about the food water and</text>
  <text start="796.72" dur="4.83">everything like that because as we know</text>
  <text start="798.85" dur="3.87">as the currency is devalued you don&amp;#39;t</text>
