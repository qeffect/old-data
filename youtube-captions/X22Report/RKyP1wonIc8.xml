  <text start="222.17" dur="4.59">supplying weapons to Ukraine in the</text>

  <text start="226.76" dur="5.22">media report is completely fake phony</text>
  <text start="229.49" dur="4.65">and false and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of this</text>
  <text start="231.98" dur="4.14">where they&amp;#39;re trying to put out these</text>
  <text start="234.14" dur="3.93">stories and make people think certain</text>
  <text start="236.12" dur="5.19">things and they&amp;#39;re turning out to be not</text>
  <text start="238.07" dur="6.21">true whatsoever we see do dirtay has met</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="5.79">Putin in Vietnam and he thanked Putin</text>
  <text start="244.28" dur="4.68">for helping in getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="247.1" dur="3.36">Islamic state Duterte</text>
  <text start="248.96" dur="4.47">instead of getting weapons from the</text>
  <text start="250.46" dur="4.56">United States he actually moved away</text>
  <text start="253.43" dur="3.9">from the United States when Obama was</text>
  <text start="255.02" dur="4.83">president and moved towards Russia and</text>
  <text start="257.33" dur="5.73">actually moved towards China where they</text>
  <text start="259.85" dur="5.64">made a deal where the Philippines was</text>
  <text start="263.06" dur="4.2">able to sell their ships in the South</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="5.28">China Sea with absolutely no problem and</text>
  <text start="267.26" dur="6.57">China&amp;#39;s warships were able to dock in</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="5.19">the Philippines and Duterte met Putin</text>
  <text start="273.83" dur="5.19">out in Vietnam and thanked him for the</text>
  <text start="275.96" dur="5.7">weapons thanked him for helping to get</text>
  <text start="279.02" dur="5.34">rid of the Islamic state and we see that</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="5.37">the deep state the Cabal they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="284.36" dur="4.95">whatever they possibly can to stop Trump</text>
  <text start="287.03" dur="4.41">from meeting Putin in Vietnam I mean</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="3.78">they have put out stories that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.44" dur="4.74">not going to meet they have no time for</text>
  <text start="293.09" dur="6.81">this but guess what Putin and Trump they</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="4.71">met in Vietnam they shook hands and they</text>
  <text start="299.9" dur="2.37">said that they weren&amp;#39;t going to meet</text>
  <text start="300.89" dur="2.82">because of scheduling conflicts I mean</text>
  <text start="302.27" dur="3.75">they made up every excuse in the book</text>
  <text start="303.71" dur="4.44">because they don&amp;#39;t want these two to</text>
  <text start="306.02" dur="5.28">talk to each other they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="308.15" dur="5.7">world seeing the United States president</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="4.679">and the President of Russia actually</text>
  <text start="313.85" dur="5.84">meeting shaking hands because Russia is</text>
  <text start="315.979" dur="5.011">supposed to be the enemy and once again</text>
  <text start="319.69" dur="4.27">Trump</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="5.28">really wanted to work with Putin and I</text>
  <text start="323.96" dur="4.32">think behind the scenes and as we can</text>
  <text start="326.27" dur="3.48">see this is what they really been doing</text>
  <text start="328.28" dur="4.259">they&amp;#39;ve been working with each other</text>
  <text start="329.75" dur="5.88">behind the scenes out in North Korea in</text>
  <text start="332.539" dur="6.931">Syria in Afghanistan and many other</text>
  <text start="335.63" dur="7.05">areas to calm everything down but the</text>
  <text start="339.47" dur="6.99">Cabal doesn&amp;#39;t want everything calmed</text>
  <text start="342.68" dur="6.81">down we see that Saudi Arabia Kuwait</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="6.39">they asked their citizens to leave</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="7.32">Lebanon we see that Israel and many</text>
  <text start="352.85" dur="9.3">other nations are pushing a war with</text>
  <text start="356.81" dur="7.859">Lebanon Syria and Iran and the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="362.15" dur="4.079">yes involved in this and the US air</text>
  <text start="364.669" dur="3.691">force came out and said yes that</text>
  <text start="366.229" dur="4.051">ballistic missile that was fired by the</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="6.3">Yemeni rebels that targeted the Saudi</text>
  <text start="370.28" dur="6.69">capital yes it was from Iran it bore the</text>
  <text start="374.66" dur="7.08">Iranian markings we see the components</text>
  <text start="376.97" dur="8.85">they were from Iran now once again that</text>
  <text start="381.74" dur="5.82">doesn&amp;#39;t mean Iran fired the missile the</text>
  <text start="385.82" dur="3.96">United States sells their missiles to</text>
  <text start="387.56" dur="6.479">many many different nations the Islamic</text>
  <text start="389.78" dur="7.319">state was using weapons from the United</text>
  <text start="394.039" dur="6.481">States al Qaeda has been using weapons</text>
  <text start="397.099" dur="5.1">from Russia and the United States where</text>
  <text start="400.52" dur="4.41">did they get this from well you can get</text>
  <text start="402.199" dur="5.451">this stuff on the black market and just</text>
  <text start="404.93" dur="5.459">because a missile was fired and again</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="5.199">allegedly fired at the Saudi capital</text>
  <text start="410.389" dur="5.131">which makes no sense for the Yemeni</text>
  <text start="412.849" dur="4.651">people and the Houthis to do because</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="4.92">they are too busy fighting the war</text>
  <text start="417.5" dur="3.81">within their country we can see that</text>
  <text start="420.44" dur="3.719">there</text>
  <text start="421.31" dur="6.93">this whole false flag agenda is to get</text>
  <text start="424.159" dur="7.471">something moving forward we see French</text>
  <text start="428.24" dur="6.859">President Emmanuel macron he visited</text>

  <text start="435.099" dur="7.151">meeting now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="438.62" dur="6.93">that they&amp;#39;re laying the groundwork for a</text>
  <text start="442.25" dur="4.44">war they&amp;#39;re trying to convince through</text>

  <text start="448.639" dur="5.871">pushing the idea that yes there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="450.409" dur="6.921">to be a war yes Iran has declared war</text>
  <text start="454.51" dur="4.29">and Lebanon has declared war and this</text>
  <text start="457.33" dur="3.57">whole thing is going to move forward</text>

  <text start="482.53" dur="4.83">United States strongly backs</text>
  <text start="484.18" dur="5.52">Lebanon&amp;#39;s independence and again we need</text>

  <text start="662.92" dur="4.05">figured if they can get something</text>
  <text start="664.15" dur="5.76">started with Iran well maybe it will</text>
  <text start="666.97" dur="4.8">flow into Syria and flow back into all</text>
  <text start="669.91" dur="4.8">the other Middle Eastern countries and</text>
  <text start="671.77" dur="6.569">we can have an all-out Great War this</text>
  <text start="674.71" dur="5.52">way so they are not done they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="678.339" dur="2.911">pushing their agenda it looks like</text>
  <text start="680.23" dur="3.32">they&amp;#39;re ready to pull the trigger</text>
  <text start="681.25" dur="5.339">because they&amp;#39;re running out of time and</text>
  <text start="683.55" dur="4.27">we can see right now that Russia and the</text>
  <text start="686.589" dur="4.261">United States that are close to reaching</text>
  <text start="687.82" dur="6.6">a final agreement in Syria and once this</text>
  <text start="690.85" dur="5.58">agreement is made this is going to be</text>
  <text start="694.42" dur="4.62">even more difficult for the GUP for the</text>
  <text start="696.43" dur="5.88">Cabal to push their agenda if there is a</text>
  <text start="699.04" dur="5.88">peace treaty in North Korea this is</text>
  <text start="702.31" dur="5.88">going to pose a huge huge problem for</text>
  <text start="704.92" dur="5.7">the Cabal and this is why they&amp;#39;re racing</text>
  <text start="708.19" dur="5.37">against time right now and they have no</text>
  <text start="710.62" dur="4.95">other alternative but to push their</text>
  <text start="713.56" dur="4.38">agenda and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised in</text>
  <text start="715.57" dur="4.44">the next couple of weeks if we see some</text>
  <text start="717.94" dur="3.84">type of huge event and we also have to</text>
  <text start="720.01" dur="2.19">remember what has been happening here in</text>
  <text start="721.78" dur="2.16">the United</text>
  <text start="722.2" dur="4.2">states where they&amp;#39;ve been having drills</text>
  <text start="723.94" dur="4.89">with an amusement park which is Kings</text>
  <text start="726.4" dur="4.32">Dominion they&amp;#39;ve been having drills in</text>
  <text start="728.83" dur="4.5">all different areas they&amp;#39;ve been having</text>
  <text start="730.72" dur="5.7">the grid X drill Wisconsin&amp;#39;s having a</text>
  <text start="733.33" dur="5.82">power grid drill going on coming up very</text>
  <text start="736.42" dur="5.64">soon and we see at this point the</text>
  <text start="739.15" dur="4.23">Pentagon is very worried about a cyber</text>
  <text start="742.06" dur="2.85">attack against the financial</text>
  <text start="743.38" dur="3.03">institutions and they&amp;#39;ve been giving us</text>
  <text start="744.91" dur="4.08">all these different warnings from all</text>
  <text start="746.41" dur="5.7">over the place and we see that they are</text>
  <text start="748.99" dur="5.73">prepared in every aspect right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="752.11" dur="4.32">just the matter of can they get this</text>
  <text start="754.72" dur="4.44">event off the ground a lot of times</text>
  <text start="756.43" dur="5.91">their plans don&amp;#39;t go the way they want</text>
  <text start="759.16" dur="5.37">them to go and they have to regroup and</text>
  <text start="762.34" dur="4.95">plan something else but something on</text>
  <text start="764.53" dur="4.92">this scale event of all events I think</text>
  <text start="767.29" dur="3.96">they have this one really planned out</text>
  <text start="769.45" dur="3.51">and they&amp;#39;ve been planning for a very</text>
  <text start="771.25" dur="5.67">long time it&amp;#39;s like the Doomsday event</text>
  <text start="772.96" dur="7.23">where they will use this as their last</text>
  <text start="776.92" dur="6.48">option because there&amp;#39;s nothing else left</text>
  <text start="780.19" dur="5.22">for them to do and they will push the</text>
  <text start="783.4" dur="4.23">event where you&amp;#39;ll see cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="785.41" dur="3.27">you&amp;#39;ll see physical attacks and it looks</text>
  <text start="787.63" dur="3.36">like they&amp;#39;re getting to the point where</text>
  <text start="788.68" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re going to be that desperate this</text>
  <text start="790.99" dur="3.69">is why you need to be ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="793" dur="4.22">because think about it we see the</text>
  <text start="794.68" dur="5.55">economy breaking down all over the place</text>
  <text start="797.22" dur="4.75">you know the Fed cannot keep the system</text>
  <text start="800.23" dur="3.6">going because they can&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="801.97" dur="4.14">everything they can manipulate and</text>
  <text start="803.83" dur="4.68">control certain things but if everyone</text>
  <text start="806.11" dur="4.26">starts losing jobs if everyone can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="808.51" dur="4.23">spend money and retail continually</text>
  <text start="810.37" dur="4.8">implodes they tighten up the subprime</text>
  <text start="812.74" dur="4.5">loan into automobiles the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="815.17" dur="5.4">going to be a disaster and we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="817.24" dur="5.66">in that direction and it&amp;#39;s going to come</text>
  <text start="820.57" dur="5.45">down they have to bring it down because</text>
  <text start="822.9" dur="6.1">they need to start the new system and</text>
  <text start="826.02" dur="4.81">they know eventually they would like to</text>
  <text start="829" dur="3.51">control they don&amp;#39;t want a Black Swan</text>
  <text start="830.83" dur="4.29">because it&amp;#39;s out of their control then</text>
  <text start="832.51" dur="5.13">they need to control everything because</text>
  <text start="835.12" dur="5.07">they have it planned out where they get</text>
  <text start="837.64" dur="5.43">us into some type of war once the war is</text>
  <text start="840.19" dur="4.74">over they restart the system we forget</text>
  <text start="843.07" dur="4.38">about the old system and how they were</text>
  <text start="844.93" dur="4.86">responsible for it and this has been</text>
  <text start="847.45" dur="4.65">their plan from the beginning so in the</text>
  <text start="849.79" dur="4.47">next couple of weeks we need to keep an</text>
  <text start="852.1" dur="3.989">eye open because we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="854.26" dur="3.36">event of all events I might even</text>
  <text start="856.089" dur="3.18">start in the Middle East which which it</text>
  <text start="857.62" dur="4.199">looks like right now or even North Korea</text>
