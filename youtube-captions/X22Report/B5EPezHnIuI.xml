  <text start="65.82" dur="6.6">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="68.49" dur="7.23">news now it&amp;#39;s one day after the election</text>
  <text start="72.42" dur="6.42">and today we saw the stock market</text>
  <text start="75.72" dur="6.27">skyrocket and gold all of a sudden shot</text>
  <text start="78.84" dur="6">up and people are scratching their heads</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="5.16">wondering why did this happen why did</text>
  <text start="84.84" dur="5.16">the market go up David Stockman was</text>
  <text start="87.15" dur="4.74">talking about a 25% decline in the</text>

  <text start="104.28" dur="8.759">the opposite direction now was this to</text>
  <text start="108.45" dur="9.15">help those individuals sell their stocks</text>
  <text start="113.039" dur="6.601">by pushing the market up maybe we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="3.51">have to wait to see in the next couple</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="4.25">of days because if it all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="121.11" dur="7.02">drops and we&amp;#39;ll have our answer and we</text>
  <text start="123.89" dur="6.97">can see right now that people have a new</text>
  <text start="128.13" dur="6.45">sense of hope because we have a new</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="5.37">candidate who supposedly is not an</text>
  <text start="134.58" dur="3.9">insider many people are saying that he</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="5.76">is an insider but we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to</text>
  <text start="138.48" dur="7.02">see how this all plays out but what we</text>
  <text start="141.99" dur="6">do know is that everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="145.5" dur="5.75">been talking about the economy the</text>
  <text start="147.99" dur="6.9">collapsing economy nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="151.25" dur="5.92">actually when Trump gets into the White</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="3.96">House if he makes it that far we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="4.59">about that a little bit later in the</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="5.52">political geopolitical report but if he</text>
  <text start="161.76" dur="5.34">does make it that far he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="164.37" dur="4.32">briefed on the entire economy he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="167.1" dur="2.969">to be briefed on what is happening out</text>
  <text start="168.69" dur="4.07">in the Middle East he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="170.069" dur="6.06">briefed on what is going on with Russia</text>
  <text start="172.76" dur="5.77">he&amp;#39;s gonna be told why this is all being</text>
  <text start="176.129" dur="4.591">done most likely he will be told that</text>
  <text start="178.53" dur="6.24">this economy is completely fake</text>
  <text start="180.72" dur="5.81">everything&amp;#39;s been manipulated and at</text>
  <text start="184.77" dur="5.34">that point he&amp;#39;ll have a decision to make</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="5.77">go along with the central bank and the</text>
  <text start="190.11" dur="4.62">shadow government because most likely</text>
  <text start="192.3" dur="3.47">they can&amp;#39;t bribe him that he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="194.73" dur="5.1">need the money</text>
  <text start="195.77" dur="6.91">they might threaten him or stand up to</text>
  <text start="199.83" dur="6.09">them and realize what he&amp;#39;s up against</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="5.88">and that will have to wait to say but</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="6.17">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now in the</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="3.53">economy is that nothing&amp;#39;s changed</text>
  <text start="212.15" dur="7.69">nothing has gotten better actually what</text>
  <text start="217.74" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re seeing is the economy is still</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="7.71">declining and we know as a businessman</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="6.36">he understands that if a business is</text>
  <text start="227.55" dur="4.05">failing and it&amp;#39;s declining sales aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="4.17">coming in what does he do he files for</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="4.68">bankruptcy he&amp;#39;s done this many many</text>
  <text start="233.46" dur="4.89">times before well he&amp;#39;s gonna realize</text>
  <text start="236.28" dur="5.22">that the economy here in the United</text>
  <text start="238.35" dur="9.75">States is not doing well so what does he</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="10.2">do he realizes how much debt the United</text>
  <text start="248.1" dur="5.609">States government is in what does he do</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="4.409">he realizes that interest rates could</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="5.881">never rise because it would crash the</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="5.011">system what does he do because what</text>
  <text start="259.59" dur="2.76">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now from all the</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="3.69">economic indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="262.35" dur="5.22">looking at which when we look back to</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="3.81">2008 they were the same exact indicators</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="3.48">that were showing that there was going</text>
  <text start="268.62" dur="4.44">to be a Great Recession in the year of</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="5.55">2008 and these indicators were showing</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="6.09">up in 2006 2007 and going into 2008 and</text>
  <text start="276.6" dur="6.27">there were a few that understood that</text>
  <text start="279.15" dur="5.97">this was coming well the same thing is</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="6.24">happening right now there are a few that</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="5.58">understand that this is coming and we</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="4.82">can see right now that GM they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="290.7" dur="5.28">to be laying off about 2,000 workers and</text>
  <text start="293.93" dur="5.62">the reason they&amp;#39;re doing this is because</text>
  <text start="295.98" dur="8.76">to us plants well they have slowing</text>
  <text start="299.55" dur="8.97">sales we see the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="5.13">are scrambling right now and it looks</text>
  <text start="308.52" dur="5.519">like they&amp;#39;re trying to make a case of</text>
  <text start="309.87" dur="5.06">why this economy might collapse or</text>
  <text start="314.039" dur="5.901">deteriorate</text>
  <text start="314.93" dur="7.489">decline during a trump presidency coming</text>
  <text start="319.94" dur="5.729">out of Business Insider we see that</text>
  <text start="322.419" dur="6.37">during the trump presidency housing</text>
  <text start="325.669" dur="6.601">could become even less affordable and we</text>
  <text start="328.789" dur="6.181">might enter a new housing crisis during</text>
  <text start="332.27" dur="5.13">his administration we can see the</text>
  <text start="334.97" dur="5.729">propaganda is running wild right now</text>
  <text start="337.4" dur="5.43">trying to explain why the economy is not</text>
  <text start="340.699" dur="5.361">going to be doing well under Trump and</text>
  <text start="342.83" dur="6.63">now they have the perfect excuse of</text>
  <text start="346.06" dur="7.51">letting us know why the economy has</text>
  <text start="349.46" dur="6.81">collapsed because Trump is now in the</text>
  <text start="353.57" dur="3.36">presidency now of course they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="356.27" dur="2.61">going to do it</text>
  <text start="356.93" dur="5.16">the second because he&amp;#39;s not in there</text>
  <text start="358.88" dur="6.93">just yet he hasn&amp;#39;t been briefed he has</text>
  <text start="362.09" dur="5.91">been told what to do yet but we can see</text>
  <text start="365.81" dur="5.07">right now they are planning for this</text>
  <text start="368" dur="5.099">they&amp;#39;re always planning and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.88" dur="8.61">always ready but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="373.099" dur="9.991">that the housing market is declining it</text>
  <text start="379.49" dur="6.899">has been for a very long time and we can</text>
  <text start="383.09" dur="4.829">see that the situation in housing has</text>
  <text start="386.389" dur="5.06">been declining this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="387.919" dur="5.97">following all of this information and</text>
  <text start="391.449" dur="5.321">tracking it for a very long time because</text>
  <text start="393.889" dur="4.891">we don&amp;#39;t want the US government the</text>
  <text start="396.77" dur="4.32">corporate media to tell us that oh all</text>
  <text start="398.78" dur="5.52">of a sudden out of nowhere the economy</text>
  <text start="401.09" dur="5.669">just fell apart no we can track it back</text>
  <text start="404.3" dur="4.709">and go backwards in time to show that no</text>
  <text start="406.759" dur="2.581">it&amp;#39;s been deteriorating for a very long</text>
  <text start="409.009" dur="3.181">time</text>
  <text start="409.34" dur="5.85">and you know we&amp;#39;re heading into this</text>
  <text start="412.19" dur="6.69">area of a major collapse of the system</text>
  <text start="415.19" dur="6.449">actually they&amp;#39;ve been planning on it we</text>
  <text start="418.88" dur="7.08">see wholesale inventory sales remain in</text>
  <text start="421.639" dur="6.421">deep recession territory September</text>
  <text start="425.96" dur="3.48">inventories rose just by 0.1 percent</text>
  <text start="428.06" dur="4.26">month a month they were expecting to go</text>
  <text start="429.44" dur="6.69">up by 0.2 percent sales missed</text>
  <text start="432.32" dur="6.45">expectations dramatically and we can see</text>
  <text start="436.13" dur="4.8">right now that these are all the</text>
  <text start="438.77" dur="7.41">different indicators pointing to a</text>
  <text start="440.93" dur="7.709">recession and we saw the same exact</text>
  <text start="446.18" dur="9.18">thing occur prior to two</text>
  <text start="448.639" dur="9.541">an8 so what is Trump going to do once he</text>
  <text start="455.36" dur="5.39">gets into the White House let&amp;#39;s just say</text>
  <text start="458.18" dur="5.97">he&amp;#39;s getting into the White House and</text>
  <text start="460.75" dur="6.219">now he has to make some decisions is he</text>
  <text start="464.15" dur="5.699">going to keep the Fed is he gonna get</text>
  <text start="466.969" dur="6.57">rid of Janet Yellen he&amp;#39;s gonna put</text>
  <text start="469.849" dur="5.97">another Fed governor in her place well</text>
  <text start="473.539" dur="4.711">the first thing he should do is most</text>
  <text start="475.819" dur="5.22">likely get rid of the central bank now</text>
  <text start="478.25" dur="5.36">he&amp;#39;s going is he going to do that well</text>
  <text start="481.039" dur="5.611">we don&amp;#39;t know because we&amp;#39;re getting some</text>
  <text start="483.61" dur="5.829">information that Trump might not be</text>
  <text start="486.65" dur="6.18">seeking yells resignation but won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="489.439" dur="6.081">nominate her for a second term now this</text>
  <text start="492.83" dur="6.54">could mean one or two things that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="495.52" dur="5.829">going to pick someone else or he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="499.37" dur="4.349">to get rid of the central bank and again</text>
  <text start="501.349" dur="5.391">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch this situation</text>
  <text start="503.719" dur="7.32">very closely because we can see that</text>
  <text start="506.74" dur="9.429">he&amp;#39;s in a position now to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="511.039" dur="8.91">central bank he&amp;#39;s in a position to get</text>
  <text start="516.169" dur="5.73">rid of Obamacare he&amp;#39;s in the position to</text>
  <text start="519.949" dur="7.051">do many different things most likely</text>
  <text start="521.899" dur="7.591">TTIP TPP that&amp;#39;s completely dead and when</text>
  <text start="527" dur="4.62">we look at this entire situation we can</text>
  <text start="529.49" dur="5.839">see that he has a lot of work ahead of</text>
  <text start="531.62" dur="6.57">him depending on which path he takes and</text>
  <text start="535.329" dur="6.25">we can see the shadow government is not</text>
  <text start="538.19" dur="5.07">going to go quietly into the night the</text>
  <text start="541.579" dur="5.781">central bank is not just going to say oh</text>
  <text start="543.26" dur="7.199">well we tried no they like power and</text>
  <text start="547.36" dur="6.01">when we look at the entire economy we</text>
  <text start="550.459" dur="5.401">can see that the economy is continually</text>
  <text start="553.37" dur="4.74">and rapidly deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="555.86" dur="5.49">quickly actually it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="558.11" dur="4.5">accelerate right now and we can see as</text>
  <text start="561.35" dur="2.52">we come up to the end of the year the</text>
  <text start="562.61" dur="4.83">holiday season&amp;#39;s is going to be a</text>
  <text start="563.87" dur="4.829">complete disaster and the situation is</text>
  <text start="567.44" dur="6.3">just going to get worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="568.699" dur="8.791">time goes on and at this point if people</text>
  <text start="573.74" dur="6.329">believe that Wow Trump is the president</text>
  <text start="577.49" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s no economic collapse everything</text>
  <text start="580.069" dur="2.43">is fixed well you&amp;#39;re in a dream world</text>
  <text start="582.17" dur="4.459">right</text>
  <text start="582.499" dur="7.74">now this is the furthest from the truth</text>
  <text start="586.629" dur="7.72">things are rapidly deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="590.239" dur="6.96">quickly just like in 2008 I mean think</text>
  <text start="594.349" dur="5.52">about 2008 for a second we had a new</text>
  <text start="597.199" dur="5.28">president back then right did the</text>
  <text start="599.869" dur="4.38">economy collapse the central bank of</text>
  <text start="602.479" dur="5.22">course stepped in they propped the</text>
  <text start="604.249" dur="3.96">system up by creating QE one two three</text>
  <text start="607.699" dur="5.07">four</text>
  <text start="608.209" dur="7.16">did that help the everyday person no so</text>
