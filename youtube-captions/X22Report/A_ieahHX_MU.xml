  <text start="89.979" dur="5.701">as we know Muller testified today and it</text>
  <text start="93.46" dur="4.56">was a complete disaster from Muller</text>
  <text start="95.68" dur="3.48">seemed like he didn&amp;#39;t know his report</text>
  <text start="98.02" dur="3.93">seems like he didn&amp;#39;t even write the</text>
  <text start="99.16" dur="6.63">report and he didn&amp;#39;t want to read back</text>
  <text start="101.95" dur="5.25">any of the passages at all he kept</text>
  <text start="105.79" dur="3.81">referring back to the report just like</text>
  <text start="107.2" dur="3.66">we thought was going to happen where he</text>
  <text start="109.6" dur="2.85">was going to say no no I can&amp;#39;t answer</text>
  <text start="110.86" dur="4.02">that I have to refer back the report or</text>
  <text start="112.45" dur="6.09">it&amp;#39;s in the report so he really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="114.88" dur="5.28">deviate at all and the DS they tried to</text>
  <text start="118.54" dur="2.91">push the idea of obstruction that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="120.16" dur="3.66">they were doing trying to push it push</text>
  <text start="121.45" dur="4.65">it push it trying to get something out</text>
  <text start="123.82" dur="5.359">of this so they can move ahead with</text>
  <text start="126.1" dur="7.56">their impeachment process but it failed</text>
  <text start="129.179" dur="6.511">it did not work they even tried to push</text>
  <text start="133.66" dur="4.859">the Russian collusion narrative and</text>
  <text start="135.69" dur="5.89">again they need that because everything</text>
  <text start="138.519" dur="5.461">else would fall apart that also failed</text>
  <text start="141.58" dur="3.57">and people are starting to wake up</text>
  <text start="143.98" dur="3.42">people are starting to scratch their</text>
  <text start="145.15" dur="4.919">head this doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense</text>
  <text start="147.4" dur="5.49">anymore this is the individual that was</text>
  <text start="150.069" dur="5.011">investigating everything we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="152.89" dur="5.569">going over this a little bit later and</text>
  <text start="155.08" dur="6.15">we&amp;#39;ll be reviewing the entire Muller</text>
  <text start="158.459" dur="4.51">testimony here but first I wanted to go</text>
  <text start="161.23" dur="2.88">back and update us on this</text>

  <text start="178.6" dur="7.32">Eric sparks to go back where you came</text>
  <text start="181.6" dur="7.62">from Don jr. responded to Ryan&amp;#39;s tweet</text>
  <text start="185.92" dur="6.03">that&amp;#39;s interesting it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="189.22" dur="4.56">those politicians are taking DC dem the</text>
  <text start="191.95" dur="4.759">narrative and carefully or not so</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="7.41">carefully crafting hoax stories to</text>
  <text start="196.709" dur="6.581">garner sympathy and relevance what is</text>
  <text start="201.19" dur="2.49">the deal with Democrats and hoaxes these</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="2.4">days</text>
  <text start="203.68" dur="4.88">apparently facts don&amp;#39;t work with their</text>
  <text start="205.69" dur="5.519">message and you see this quite often</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="4.63">where they&amp;#39;re out there telling you oh</text>
  <text start="211.209" dur="4.611">this person said that this person said</text>
  <text start="213.19" dur="4.92">that and it turns out to be a hoax and</text>
  <text start="215.82" dur="4.63">maybe we should start saying these are</text>
  <text start="218.11" dur="5.01">all small @ hoaxes because that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="220.45" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re all turning out to be there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="4.29">facts there&amp;#39;s no proof and when you</text>
  <text start="225.19" dur="5.31">really look deep into it it turns out to</text>
  <text start="227.41" dur="6.78">be fake now let&amp;#39;s go into the Muller</text>
  <text start="230.5" dur="5.489">hearing it unfolded exactly as we</text>
  <text start="234.19" dur="4.47">expected the push to keep the Russian</text>
  <text start="235.989" dur="5.491">story alive and the other push to show</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="6.12">that Trump obstructed the investigation</text>
  <text start="241.48" dur="5.55">so the DS can push impeachment that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.78" dur="4.2">what they want they need to get him out</text>
  <text start="247.03" dur="4.47">of office this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="248.98" dur="4.95">doing since the beginning but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="6.769">problem there&amp;#39;s no evidence of</text>
  <text start="253.93" dur="7.95">obstruction the DS they tried to push</text>
  <text start="258.269" dur="6.881">everything that they had but they</text>
  <text start="261.88" dur="7.92">couldn&amp;#39;t produce the evidence if there</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="6.96">was evidence if they had the obstruction</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="5.429">in the Muller report they would have</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="5.47">used it to push the impeachment</text>
  <text start="275.229" dur="6.851">resolution</text>
  <text start="277.58" dur="7.17">it wasn&amp;#39;t there now what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="282.08" dur="6.149">is they&amp;#39;re putting on this show to try</text>
  <text start="284.75" dur="4.919">to create this idea that there was</text>
  <text start="288.229" dur="5.4">obstruction so they can have another</text>
  <text start="289.669" dur="6.511">vote this will fail once again because</text>
  <text start="293.629" dur="3.6">people are gonna ask questions now</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="3.959">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="297.229" dur="6.211">question continued came up of who the</text>
  <text start="300.139" dur="4.951">report was written for was it written</text>
  <text start="303.44" dur="3.599">for the Attorney General Mark kept on</text>
  <text start="305.09" dur="4.77">saying yes it&amp;#39;s written for the Attorney</text>
  <text start="307.039" dur="4.261">General but was it really because when</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="3.779">you look at this report and you read it</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="5.1">is this really a report that you would</text>
  <text start="313.639" dur="6.691">give the Attorney General or is this a</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="7.019">report that you would give the DS to</text>
  <text start="320.33" dur="5.1">leak out to the mainstream media to make</text>
  <text start="323.419" dur="6.9">it look a lot worse than it was because</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="7.35">in volume 2 guess what they just said oh</text>
  <text start="330.319" dur="4.021">yeah there were no charges but this is</text>
  <text start="332.78" dur="2.849">what happened oh there were no charges</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="4.31">there was no proof but this is what</text>
  <text start="335.629" dur="5.361">happened it seems like they were just</text>
  <text start="338.65" dur="5.29">taking what the mainstream media had</text>
  <text start="340.99" dur="4.81">putting it into volume 2 and then</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="5.159">regurgitating it back out to the public</text>
  <text start="345.8" dur="7.35">and most of it I would say 99.9% of it</text>
  <text start="349.099" dur="5.521">is completely fake now the other thing</text>
  <text start="353.15" dur="4.949">is the other question they came up is</text>
  <text start="354.62" dur="4.949">about obstruction and this was shot down</text>
  <text start="358.099" dur="3.051">multiple times during the questioning</text>
  <text start="359.569" dur="4.551">and we&amp;#39;ll discuss that in a little bit</text>
  <text start="361.15" dur="5.62">another question was asked about</text>
  <text start="364.12" dur="5.829">exoneration and remember we discussed</text>
  <text start="366.77" dur="6.47">this yesterday prosecutors they collect</text>
  <text start="369.949" dur="6.87">evidence they put together a case and</text>
  <text start="373.24" dur="6.28">they don&amp;#39;t say oh this person is guilty</text>
  <text start="376.819" dur="6.231">this person&amp;#39;s exonerated they don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="379.52" dur="6.989">that that&amp;#39;s not for them to decide and</text>
  <text start="383.05" dur="5.589">if you look at any law book they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="386.509" dur="4.94">even mention the prosecutor saying</text>
  <text start="388.639" dur="6.93">exonerate remember everyone is innocent</text>
  <text start="391.449" dur="7.421">so if you can&amp;#39;t make the case you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="395.569" dur="5.19">say well I exonerate them when you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="5.729">make the case and prove that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.759" dur="7.121">guilty it falls back to innocent that</text>
  <text start="404.599" dur="8.261">they&amp;#39;re automatically exonerated</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="6.63">and this came up many many times first</text>
  <text start="412.86" dur="5.18">let&amp;#39;s start with obstruction</text>
  <text start="414.51" dur="5.97">Mike memo Lee tweeted out the filing</text>
  <text start="418.04" dur="5.4">Collins at any point during the</text>
  <text start="420.48" dur="7.41">investigation was it hindered or stopped</text>
  <text start="423.44" dur="8.34">Muller no Don jr. responded to Mike&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.89" dur="7.47">tweet in other words no obstruction</text>
  <text start="431.78" dur="5.05">Trump tweeted out the following Muller</text>
  <text start="435.36" dur="3.72">was asked whether or not the</text>
  <text start="436.83" dur="5.28">investigation was impeded in any way and</text>
  <text start="439.08" dur="6.69">he said no in other words there it there</text>
  <text start="442.11" dur="6.27">was no obstruction now representative</text>
  <text start="445.77" dur="5.31">Ben Kline a smaller about his</text>
  <text start="448.38" dur="6.21">interpretation of obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="451.08" dur="7.28">and he&amp;#39;s pointed to statute 18 us code</text>
  <text start="454.59" dur="5.73">15 section 12 subsection C and</text>
  <text start="458.36" dur="3.79">representative Klein pointed out that</text>
  <text start="460.32" dur="3.33">the Attorney General did not agree with</text>
  <text start="462.15" dur="4.71">Muller&amp;#39;s interpretation of the</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="5.58">obstruction statute Muller pretty much</text>
  <text start="466.86" dur="5.28">had no comment on this representative</text>
  <text start="469.23" dur="5.16">Kline brought up Andrew Weissman</text>
  <text start="472.14" dur="6.09">remember he&amp;#39;s the individual that went</text>
  <text start="474.39" dur="7.44">after author Andersen and he had a</text>
  <text start="478.23" dur="6.42">conviction against author Andersen later</text>
  <text start="481.83" dur="6.12">on it was overturned because his legal</text>
  <text start="484.65" dur="5.22">theory was unsound Weissman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.95" dur="3.96">interpretation of this statute permitted</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="4.14">the conviction of people involved in</text>
  <text start="491.91" dur="4.14">legal acts and shut down the firm and</text>
  <text start="494.01" dur="4.64">many people lost their job then a judge</text>
  <text start="496.05" dur="5.4">overturned this ruling and</text>
  <text start="498.65" dur="6.63">representative Kline was giving this as</text>
  <text start="501.45" dur="6.51">an example to Muller and saying listen</text>
  <text start="505.28" dur="5.77">your interpretation and Wiseman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.96" dur="3.99">interpretation does not hold up in the</text>
  <text start="511.05" dur="6.27">court of law</text>
  <text start="511.95" dur="8.99">and it&amp;#39;s the same here that&amp;#39;s why he was</text>
  <text start="517.32" dur="5.849">bringing this up let&amp;#39;s continue</text>
  <text start="520.94" dur="3.64">representative Collins caught former</text>
  <text start="523.169" dur="3.931">Special Counsel robert muller</text>
  <text start="524.58" dur="4.68">and a contradiction in his testimony in</text>
  <text start="527.1" dur="4.41">his opening statement Muller stated</text>
  <text start="529.26" dur="3.81">would you not address collusion which is</text>
  <text start="531.51" dur="3.6">not a legal term rather we focus on</text>
  <text start="533.07" dur="4.29">whether the evidence was sufficient to</text>
  <text start="535.11" dur="4.41">charge any member of the campaign with</text>
  <text start="537.36" dur="3.56">taking part in a criminal conspiracy and</text>
  <text start="539.52" dur="3.65">it was not</text>
  <text start="540.92" dur="5.699">that statement suggested that the report</text>
  <text start="543.17" dur="6.479">had not in fact concluded that Trump had</text>
  <text start="546.619" dur="5.64">colluded with Russia contrary to what</text>
  <text start="549.649" dur="4.85">the president has said and with common</text>
  <text start="552.259" dur="5.221">public understanding of the report</text>
  <text start="554.499" dur="5.5">Collins began by asking mother whether</text>
  <text start="557.48" dur="6.299">collusion and conspiracy were synonymous</text>
  <text start="559.999" dur="6.03">Muller said No however Collins read</text>
  <text start="563.779" dur="4.29">mother&amp;#39;s own report to him on page 180</text>
  <text start="566.029" dur="4.55">of all you meone of your report you</text>
  <text start="568.069" dur="4.92">wrote as defined in legal dictionaries</text>
  <text start="570.579" dur="5.26">collusion is largely synonymous with</text>
  <text start="572.989" dur="4.801">conspiracy as that crime is set forth in</text>
  <text start="575.839" dur="5.42">general federal conspiracy statute 18</text>
  <text start="577.79" dur="6.239">USC 371 are you sitting here today</text>
  <text start="581.259" dur="6.16">testifying something different than what</text>
  <text start="584.029" dur="5.73">you report States Muller struggled to</text>
  <text start="587.419" dur="4.38">explain the contradiction and ultimately</text>
  <text start="589.759" dur="5.281">admitted that the interpretation in his</text>
  <text start="591.799" dur="7.26">report was the correct one rather than</text>
  <text start="595.04" dur="10.379">the answer we he had just given to</text>
  <text start="599.059" dur="9.601">Congress so Collins caught Muller trying</text>
  <text start="605.419" dur="6.871">to deviate from what was in his report</text>
  <text start="608.66" dur="7.409">and Collins caught him on it now</text>
  <text start="612.29" dur="9.06">representative John Ratcliffe brought</text>
  <text start="616.069" dur="8.901">the heat to Muller take a listen to what</text>
  <text start="621.35" dur="6.539">he said the bottom of page 2 of volume 2</text>
  <text start="624.97" dur="4.63">reads as follows the evidence we</text>
  <text start="627.889" dur="3.81">obtained about the president&amp;#39;s actions</text>
  <text start="629.6" dur="4.049">and intent presents difficult issues</text>
  <text start="631.699" dur="3.901">that prevent us from conclusively</text>
  <text start="633.649" dur="3.961">determining that no criminal conduct</text>
  <text start="635.6" dur="3.899">occurred accordingly while this report</text>
  <text start="637.61" dur="3.629">does not conclude that the president</text>
  <text start="639.499" dur="4.77">committed a crime it also does not</text>
  <text start="641.239" dur="6.69">exonerate him oh I read that correctly</text>
  <text start="644.269" dur="5.641">yes all right now your report and today</text>
  <text start="647.929" dur="3.84">you said at all times the Special</text>
  <text start="649.91" dur="3.419">Counsel team operated under was guided</text>
  <text start="651.769" dur="4.29">by and followed Justice Department</text>
  <text start="653.329" dur="5.401">policies and principles so which DOJ</text>
  <text start="656.059" dur="4.59">policy or principle sets forth a legal</text>
  <text start="658.73" dur="4.049">standard that an investigated person is</text>

  <text start="665.509" dur="3.281">determined</text>
  <text start="666.78" dur="4.56">can you repeat the last part of that</text>
  <text start="668.79" dur="4.74">question yeah which DOJ policy or</text>
  <text start="671.34" dur="3.78">principle set forth a legal standard</text>
  <text start="673.53" dur="3.84">that an investigated person is not</text>
