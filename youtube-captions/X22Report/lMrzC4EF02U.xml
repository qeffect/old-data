  <text start="105.909" dur="7.051">throughout this recovery since 2008 the</text>
  <text start="109.33" dur="5.039">Fed the United States the establishment</text>
  <text start="112.96" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that the economy</text>
  <text start="114.369" dur="4.32">has been doing well the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.56" dur="4.199">booming this is what we can expect from</text>
  <text start="118.689" dur="4.411">a recovery then the economy was handed</text>
  <text start="120.759" dur="3.871">off to trump and they are still out</text>
  <text start="123.1" dur="4.47">there telling us that the economy is</text>
  <text start="124.63" dur="4.739">doing well the Fed in their meeting</text>
  <text start="127.57" dur="4.29">decided not to change anything because</text>
  <text start="129.369" dur="5.191">they are scared stiff of what would</text>
  <text start="131.86" dur="5.01">happen if they did do something the</text>
  <text start="134.56" dur="3.81">corporate media right now and the IMF</text>
  <text start="136.87" dur="4.02">they are starting to build the</text>
  <text start="138.37" dur="5.369">propaganda that oh maybe the economy is</text>
  <text start="140.89" dur="4.56">not doing as well at this point but for</text>
  <text start="143.739" dur="4.171">the most part many people think that the</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="5.039">economy&amp;#39;s doing doing very very well now</text>
  <text start="147.91" dur="4.26">as we can see the statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="150.489" dur="3.571">the manipulation is continuing that</text>
  <text start="152.17" dur="4.43">hasn&amp;#39;t stopped so right now we have</text>
  <text start="154.06" dur="4.5">employment that is at decade lows</text>
  <text start="156.6" dur="4.479">unemployment claims are at the lowest</text>
  <text start="158.56" dur="4.86">levels in 40 years the stock market is</text>
  <text start="161.079" dur="3.69">at record highs and climbing consumers</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="4.5">are more confident than they have ever</text>
  <text start="164.769" dur="5.821">been in a decade wages well they really</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="6.33">haven&amp;#39;t moved anywhere and people are</text>
  <text start="170.59" dur="5.97">hoping that this will improve now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.25" dur="4.17">not to love when you hear all this you</text>
  <text start="176.56" dur="5.1">it sounds fantastic the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="178.42" dur="5.879">well well we have to ask ourselves a</text>
  <text start="181.66" dur="5.13">question if things are so good then why</text>
  <text start="184.299" dur="5.16">is America&amp;#39;s saving rate post</text>
  <text start="186.79" dur="5.759">such a sharp decline and we talked about</text>
  <text start="189.459" dur="4.741">savings rate before and the answer is</text>
  <text start="192.549" dur="4.86">really not that surprising</text>
  <text start="194.2" dur="5.849">despite the bullish economic optics the</text>
  <text start="197.409" dur="5.25">reality of for the majority of Americans</text>
  <text start="200.049" dur="5.22">is they simply have not yet recovered</text>
  <text start="202.659" dur="4.47">from the financial crisis this goes down</text>
  <text start="205.269" dur="4.981">to the level of the people I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="207.129" dur="5.371">talking about the very wealthy I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="210.25" dur="4.47">talking about Wall Street I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="212.5" dur="4.65">about the everyday person in America</text>
  <text start="214.72" dur="5.609">because what they are seeing is the</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="6.179">rising cost of living and this is</text>
  <text start="220.329" dur="6.74">continually eating away at their income</text>
  <text start="223.329" dur="7.321">so the bottom 80% the rising cost of</text>
  <text start="227.069" dur="7.48">living outpace the medium level of</text>
  <text start="230.65" dur="7.53">disposable income and as a consequence</text>
  <text start="234.549" dur="6.72">this makes it very very difficult to</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="6.029">save and we&amp;#39;ve seen this for a very long</text>
  <text start="241.269" dur="5.821">time so as the cost of living began out</text>
  <text start="244.209" dur="5.911">to outpace incomes the difference came</text>
  <text start="247.09" dur="8.31">from savings and a continuous increase</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="8.459">in debt now remember debt is the product</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="4.98">of the central bank this is what they</text>
  <text start="258.579" dur="5.611">dish out this is what they sell</text>
  <text start="260.38" dur="6.75">countries and the people and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="264.19" dur="6.99">seeing right now is that debt is like a</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="9.659">cancer and it spreads and it eats away</text>
  <text start="271.18" dur="9.06">at pretty much everything so in 2000 the</text>
  <text start="276.789" dur="6.541">growth rate of debt sharply accelerated</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="6.48">above PCE growth this debt fueled</text>
  <text start="283.33" dur="6.72">consumption has not led to stronger</text>
  <text start="286.72" dur="7.08">rates of economic growth and like I said</text>
  <text start="290.05" dur="6.72">debt is a sickness it&amp;#39;s a disease it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="293.8" dur="6.06">cancer and it&amp;#39;s a cancer on individuals</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="5.639">wealth because it&amp;#39;s siphons potential</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="6.149">savings from income as those funds are</text>
  <text start="302.409" dur="5.79">diverted to debt services riving rising</text>
  <text start="306.009" dur="4.351">levels of debt means rising levels of</text>
  <text start="308.199" dur="4.59">debt service which reduces actual</text>
  <text start="310.36" dur="4.38">disposable personal income that could be</text>
  <text start="312.789" dur="5.551">saved or reinvested back into the</text>
  <text start="314.74" dur="5.429">economy like purchasing retail and we</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="6.24">know for a fact</text>
  <text start="320.169" dur="6.72">retail is having a problem so the</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="4.889">mirages of consumer wealth has been a</text>
  <text start="326.889" dur="6.36">function of surging debt levels wealth</text>
  <text start="329.469" dur="5.94">is not borrowed but saved they tricked</text>
  <text start="333.249" dur="4.111">us into thinking and they come out with</text>
  <text start="335.409" dur="4.35">these stats all the time oh the people</text>
  <text start="337.36" dur="4.799">are out there spending because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.759" dur="4.201">getting the data from the credit cards</text>
  <text start="342.159" dur="3.241">they&amp;#39;ve been using well that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="343.96" dur="4.019">adding more debt that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you</text>
  <text start="345.4" dur="5.94">have the savings to purchase these goods</text>
  <text start="347.979" dur="5.511">and the reality is that since savings</text>
  <text start="351.34" dur="4.829">are the cornerstone of economic growth</text>
  <text start="353.49" dur="5.019">savings provides for productive</text>
  <text start="356.169" dur="5.61">investment and in lending and it should</text>
  <text start="358.509" dur="6.481">be of no surprise that this correlates</text>
  <text start="361.779" dur="6.091">to GDP it correlates to retail it</text>
  <text start="364.99" dur="6.149">correlates to PCE it correlates to all</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="4.53">of this now while many are out they are</text>
  <text start="371.139" dur="3.9">in the suggesting that debt is not a</text>
  <text start="372.4" dur="5.069">problem the evidence well it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="375.039" dur="4.981">darn clear that rising debt levels have</text>
  <text start="377.469" dur="6.391">impeded economic growth savings and</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="7.259">consumptions since 1980 that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="383.86" dur="5.07">things started really go downhill now</text>
  <text start="387.279" dur="3.69">the average American is still living</text>
  <text start="388.93" dur="3.419">well beyond their means the reality is</text>
  <text start="390.969" dur="3.901">that the economic growth will remain</text>
  <text start="392.349" dur="4.44">mired at lower levels as savings</text>
  <text start="394.87" dur="5.34">continue to be diverted from productive</text>
  <text start="396.789" dur="5.49">investment into debt services and this</text>
  <text start="400.21" dur="7.019">is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="402.279" dur="7.07">and it&amp;#39;s absolutely awful and this is</text>
  <text start="407.229" dur="5.09">not going to get better anytime soon</text>
  <text start="409.349" dur="5.261">because when you look through all the</text>
  <text start="412.319" dur="3.791">manipulation and you you know you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="414.61" dur="2.82">pay attention to that because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.11" dur="3.69">just throwing these numbers at you and</text>
  <text start="417.43" dur="4.919">it just sounds great when you look at</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="3.899">the bottom line just like the subprime</text>
  <text start="422.349" dur="3.09">securities you know they threw out</text>
  <text start="423.699" dur="3.661">triple-a they told the everything was</text>
  <text start="425.439" dur="3.331">fine everything was contained but when</text>
  <text start="427.36" dur="4.35">you look through that and you actually</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="5.1">look within the securities and what was</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="3.269">all wrapped up in there you found out</text>
  <text start="433.87" dur="2.909">the truth and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="434.979" dur="3.9">doing we&amp;#39;ve been looking past the</text>
  <text start="436.779" dur="5.01">manipulation and looking at the truth</text>
  <text start="438.879" dur="5.31">and again the truth is going to shine</text>
  <text start="441.789" dur="5.43">through there&amp;#39;s you can&amp;#39;t stop it you</text>
  <text start="444.189" dur="5.82">can delay it but eventually it pushes</text>
  <text start="447.219" dur="4.581">through and reality sets in and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.009" dur="4">what we&amp;#39;re going to see we see US</text>
  <text start="451.8" dur="5.169">manufacturing worker productivity</text>
  <text start="454.009" dur="6.21">it has crashed most in eight years now</text>
  <text start="456.969" dur="5.111">the productivity quarter-on-quarter</text>
  <text start="460.219" dur="5.73">crashed around five percent this is the</text>
  <text start="462.08" dur="5.309">biggest drop since 2009 and this is when</text>
  <text start="465.949" dur="4.44">the economy was in a recession and every</text>
  <text start="467.389" dur="5.34">time we see the US manufacturing</text>
  <text start="470.389" dur="5.31">productivity drop guess what it is a</text>
  <text start="472.729" dur="4.951">sign that we are in a recession and</text>
  <text start="475.699" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;ve seen this going all the way back</text>
  <text start="477.68" dur="6.659">to the 2001 dot-com bubble we saw it</text>
  <text start="481.009" dur="6.81">back in 2008 and we are seeing the same</text>
  <text start="484.339" dur="7.2">exact pattern once again now we talk a</text>
  <text start="487.819" dur="6.24">lot about the new world order but what</text>
  <text start="491.539" dur="6.171">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is there&amp;#39;s a new</text>
  <text start="494.059" dur="6.42">economic world order headed our way and</text>
  <text start="497.71" dur="3.34">we&amp;#39;ve discussed this before it&amp;#39;s bail-in</text>
  <text start="500.479" dur="3.78">Road</text>
  <text start="501.05" dur="4.799">it&amp;#39;s that initiative and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="504.259" dur="5.071">change the lives of children and</text>
  <text start="505.849" dur="4.141">grandchildren and it is coming very very</text>
  <text start="509.33" dur="3.6">quickly</text>
  <text start="509.99" dur="4.44">now once the project is around</text>
  <text start="512.93" dur="5.01">twenty-five to thirty seven thirty</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="6.209">percent complete guess what the impact</text>
  <text start="517.94" dur="5.25">will be felt globally how soon will this</text>
  <text start="520.639" dur="4.831">happen we&amp;#39;re looking at about five years</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="4.17">right now maybe even sooner because</text>
  <text start="525.47" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re really pushing this very hard</text>
  <text start="527.36" dur="6.62">and believe me that five years comes</text>
  <text start="529.43" dur="7.349">very very quickly now natural resources</text>
  <text start="533.98" dur="6.339">they&amp;#39;re going to be funneled into the</text>
  <text start="536.779" dur="6.261">eastern countries or they will simply</text>
  <text start="540.319" dur="5.491">never leave from the country and</text>
  <text start="543.04" dur="4.21">everything they mined extract it and</text>
  <text start="545.81" dur="4.8">everything like that is going to stay</text>
  <text start="547.25" dur="5.1">out their global employees will</text>
  <text start="550.61" dur="4.14">disappear from the West now think about</text>
  <text start="552.35" dur="7.469">this for a second why have they been</text>
  <text start="554.75" dur="8.49">moving all corporations jobs employees</text>
  <text start="559.819" dur="4.981">out of the United States why do you</text>
  <text start="563.24" dur="3.659">think all of this was happening over a</text>
  <text start="564.8" dur="4.07">very long period of time because they</text>
  <text start="566.899" dur="4.951">knew in the central banking system knew</text>
  <text start="568.87" dur="4.39">that eventually what was going to happen</text>
  <text start="571.85" dur="2.7">is that this system was going to die</text>
  <text start="573.26" dur="5.67">and they were going to transfer</text>
  <text start="574.55" dur="5.96">everything out to the east so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.93" dur="4.469">seeing right now this was all in</text>
  <text start="580.51" dur="4.929">preparation for what was coming</text>
  <text start="583.399" dur="4.86">everything shifting from the west to the</text>
  <text start="585.439" dur="5.52">east and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="588.259" dur="5.97">be ride when everything starts to shift</text>
  <text start="590.959" dur="5.43">the transition hits which is a collapse</text>
  <text start="594.229" dur="5.431">of the old system and the birth of a new</text>
  <text start="596.389" dur="5.97">system and we&amp;#39;re in the old system now</text>
  <text start="599.66" dur="3.169">let&amp;#39;s look at some facts on the Belton</text>
  <text start="602.359" dur="7.14">Road</text>
  <text start="602.829" dur="10.95">it connects 65 countries and 4.4 billion</text>
  <text start="609.499" dur="7.67">people in 2016 Chinese companies signed</text>
  <text start="613.779" dur="6.61">8150 eight contracts in 61 countries</text>
  <text start="617.169" dur="5.62">worth a hundred and fifty billion</text>
  <text start="620.389" dur="4.47">dollars in 2016 China&amp;#39;s trade with one</text>
  <text start="622.789" dur="4.53">belt one road countries reached nine</text>
  <text start="624.859" dur="4.801">hundred and fifty three billion over the</text>
  <text start="627.319" dur="5.25">next ten years China will spend two</text>
  <text start="629.66" dur="5.009">trillion on one belt one road</text>
  <text start="632.569" dur="6.14">infrastructure and more amazingly they</text>
  <text start="634.669" dur="8.19">are not tasked asking the investig--</text>
  <text start="638.709" dur="6.58">to pay it back what is also very clear</text>
  <text start="642.859" dur="4.38">from the map is that China has no</text>
  <text start="645.289" dur="4.59">interest in controlling the seas now</text>
  <text start="647.239" dur="5.79">this is very interesting they realize</text>
  <text start="649.879" dur="5.25">the seas well it takes a very long time</text>
  <text start="653.029" dur="4.26">to ship anything and they&amp;#39;re saying you</text>
  <text start="655.129" dur="7.92">know what the US can control the Seas</text>
  <text start="657.289" dur="7.82">they don&amp;#39;t care so the US you know the</text>
  <text start="663.049" dur="4.74">seventh the eighth the ninth US fleets</text>
  <text start="665.109" dur="6.34">they can continually sail the seas no</text>
  <text start="667.789" dur="9.931">problem because what China is doing is</text>
  <text start="671.449" dur="9.031">they are going over land and we can see</text>
  <text start="677.72" dur="5.309">that this is going to be a lot more</text>
  <text start="680.48" dur="5.25">efficient now if we look at this we can</text>

  <text start="738.88" dur="6.52">countries are signing on to this the US</text>
  <text start="742.1" dur="5.1">has not and what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="745.4" dur="3.33">all those resources and everything out</text>
  <text start="747.2" dur="4.31">there and all the products are going to</text>

  <text start="769.64" dur="5.01">representative to the belton Road</text>
  <text start="771.08" dur="5.04">meeting remember the globalists they</text>
  <text start="774.65" dur="3">didn&amp;#39;t want that they wanted their own</text>
  <text start="776.12" dur="2.58">system which was completely different</text>
  <text start="777.65" dur="4.05">where they were going to blend all the</text>

  <text start="802.16" dur="5.36">they were on a different plan this is</text>
  <text start="805.07" dur="6.21">why they had the court systems with TPP</text>
  <text start="807.52" dur="6.79">above the government court system or the</text>
  <text start="811.28" dur="5.61">government rule this way they called the</text>
  <text start="814.31" dur="6.87">shots and told these countries what to</text>
