  <text start="80.91" dur="4.9">technology that is going to be the</text>
  <text start="83.65" dur="3.12">future and they&amp;#39;re very too worried</text>
  <text start="85.81" dur="3.3">about it and this is why all those</text>
  <text start="86.77" dur="4.32">reports came out saying that you know if</text>
  <text start="89.11" dur="4.08">cryptocurrency continues on its path</text>
  <text start="91.09" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s going to damage their business</text>
  <text start="93.19" dur="3.179">actually it&amp;#39;s going to put them out of</text>
  <text start="94.45" dur="4.26">business that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="96.369" dur="4.411">afraid of and this is why Jamie Dimon</text>
  <text start="98.71" dur="5.49">and other banksters came out and said</text>
  <text start="100.78" dur="6.42">that bitcoin is a fraud it&amp;#39;s in a bubble</text>
  <text start="104.2" dur="5.279">and they pretty much manipulated it now</text>
  <text start="107.2" dur="4.559">if you remember we talked about this</text>
  <text start="109.479" dur="4.741">with an interview with Jeff Nielsen and</text>
  <text start="111.759" dur="6.541">how they can throw tons of you know</text>
  <text start="114.22" dur="5.459">pre-printed currency at the crypto</text>
  <text start="118.3" dur="5.94">market or use mount</text>
  <text start="119.679" dur="6.061">GOx to dump Bitcoin or anything else</text>
  <text start="124.24" dur="3.989">like that first they would buy it up</text>
  <text start="125.74" dur="5.01">then they would dump it and make it look</text>
  <text start="128.229" dur="5.76">very volatile and we can see that</text>
  <text start="130.75" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this and basically</text>
  <text start="133.989" dur="5.061">showing the world see it was in a bubble</text>
  <text start="136.33" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s very volatile don&amp;#39;t use it and</text>
  <text start="139.05" dur="5.65">Jamie Dimon he came out and said bitcoin</text>
  <text start="141.94" dur="5.04">is a fraud even though we know the</text>
  <text start="144.7" dur="5.009">bank&amp;#39;s their investment houses are</text>
  <text start="146.98" dur="5.07">investing in it even the central banks</text>
  <text start="149.709" dur="6.181">are investing in it and we could see</text>
  <text start="152.05" dur="4.32">right now JP Morgan Chase they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="3.66">trouble</text>
  <text start="156.37" dur="6.78">now remember the banks they decided that</text>
  <text start="159.55" dur="6.6">you cannot use the credit cards that</text>
  <text start="163.15" dur="6.6">they issued to purchase Bitcoin because</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="5.16">they want to protect you from volatility</text>
  <text start="169.75" dur="3.93">but you can use your credit card to</text>
  <text start="171.31" dur="5.16">gamble that&amp;#39;s fine but you can&amp;#39;t use it</text>
  <text start="173.68" dur="4.41">to purchase Bitcoin because they want to</text>
  <text start="176.47" dur="3.269">protect the public yeah that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="3.509">bangs want to do they want to protect</text>
  <text start="179.739" dur="4.11">the public the central bank&amp;#39;s want to</text>
  <text start="181.599" dur="2.64">protect the people now that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="183.849" dur="2.641">it is</text>
  <text start="184.239" dur="4.381">they&amp;#39;re protecting themselves</text>
  <text start="186.49" dur="5.31">and it looks like JPMorgan Chase has</text>
  <text start="188.62" dur="4.98">been busted for Bitcoin fraud now</text>
  <text start="191.8" dur="4.71">there&amp;#39;s been a lawsuit in Manhattan</text>
  <text start="193.6" dur="5.52">federal court accusing it of charging</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="5.34">surprise fees when it stopped letting</text>
  <text start="199.12" dur="4.68">customers buy cryptocurrency with credit</text>
  <text start="201.85" dur="5.52">cards in late January and began treating</text>
  <text start="203.8" dur="6.96">the purchases as cash advances now the</text>
  <text start="207.37" dur="5.88">lawsuit accuses Jace JPMorgan Chase of</text>
  <text start="210.76" dur="4.62">violating the u.s. Truth in Lending Act</text>
  <text start="213.25" dur="4.05">which requires credit card issuers to</text>
  <text start="215.38" dur="4.4">notify customers in writing of any</text>
  <text start="217.3" dur="5.34">significant change in charges or terms</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="4.54">simply put the bank switched from</text>
  <text start="222.64" dur="3.84">charging regular interest rates to</text>
  <text start="224.32" dur="4.98">charging higher cash advance rates on</text>
  <text start="226.48" dur="5.16">purchases of crypto currencies without</text>
  <text start="229.3" dur="4.68">notifying their customers you see how</text>
  <text start="231.64" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re protecting the public so the</text>

  <text start="270.46" dur="6.56">people know what they&amp;#39;re doing is they</text>
  <text start="273.52" dur="5.91">are basically ripping people off and</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="4.33">they&amp;#39;re trying to force people out of</text>

  <text start="355.2" dur="6.51">has a warning out saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="6.15">starting to see cracks in Canadian</text>
  <text start="361.71" dur="5.94">credit more specifically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.68" dur="5.4">seeing is consumer credit it is becoming</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="5.07">a problem yet again and it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="5.49">in Canada and why this is all happening</text>
  <text start="372.72" dur="4.62">because of low interest rates and the</text>
  <text start="375.57" dur="5.28">cheap and easy access to capital</text>
  <text start="377.34" dur="7.17">well basically has gone from a solution</text>
  <text start="380.85" dur="6.45">now to a problem and lenders are seeing</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="6.09">delinquency rates roll out in time and</text>
  <text start="387.3" dur="5.34">duration now we know that interest rates</text>
  <text start="390.6" dur="4.92">are moving up we know that real estate</text>
  <text start="392.64" dur="5.25">is cooling in Canada we&amp;#39;re seeing a huge</text>
  <text start="395.52" dur="4.32">drop in prices and sales and everything</text>
  <text start="397.89" dur="5.73">else and there is growing speculation</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="7.56">that the debt burden poses a threat to</text>
  <text start="403.62" dur="5.88">the financial system even as Canadian</text>
  <text start="407.4" dur="4.32">housing prices remain one of the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.5" dur="4.59">true bubbles and they&amp;#39;re still up there</text>
  <text start="411.72" dur="5.81">we see everything starting to break down</text>
  <text start="414.09" dur="6.12">and it doesn&amp;#39;t look good now RBC adds</text>
  <text start="417.53" dur="4.69">roll rates in National Bank of Canada&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.21" dur="6.66">Canadian credit card trust program are</text>
  <text start="422.22" dur="6.99">at the highest since 2008 and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="3.99">seeing early stages of delinquency sixty</text>
  <text start="429.21" dur="4.4">to eighty nine date delinquencies and</text>
  <text start="430.86" dur="5.34">roll rates are above the 10-year average</text>
  <text start="433.61" dur="4.18">they&amp;#39;re starting to see a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="436.2" dur="6.33">problems now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="437.79" dur="8.4">we discuss the subprime problems where</text>
  <text start="442.53" dur="6.39">we saw small subprime lenders declare</text>
  <text start="446.19" dur="4.53">bankruptcy and it&amp;#39;s getting worse now</text>
  <text start="448.92" dur="3.87">one of the collapse small lenders was</text>
  <text start="450.72" dur="3.45">Summit Financial Corp</text>
  <text start="452.79" dur="4.68">and when it filed for bankruptcy on</text>
  <text start="454.17" dur="6.6">March 23rd it disclosed that it owed</text>
  <text start="457.47" dur="5.19">Bank of America 77 million dollars now</text>
  <text start="460.77" dur="4.44">this loan was secured by the auto loan</text>
  <text start="462.66" dur="6.66">summit had extended to subprime</text>
  <text start="465.21" dur="7.11">customers who are now defaulting in</text>
  <text start="469.32" dur="5.7">large numbers now in the bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="472.32" dur="4.89">documents Bank of America allege that</text>
  <text start="475.02" dur="5.88">summit had repossessed many of these</text>
  <text start="477.21" dur="7.37">cars without writing down the bad loans</text>
  <text start="480.9" dur="6.21">thus under reporting the losses and</text>
  <text start="484.58" dur="3.25">misrepresenting the value of the</text>
  <text start="487.11" dur="3.33">collateral</text>
  <text start="487.83" dur="4.92">this allowed summit to borrow more from</text>
  <text start="490.44" dur="5.85">Bank of America to fund more subprime</text>
  <text start="492.75" dur="6.6">loans summit is just a very tiny lender</text>
  <text start="496.29" dur="5.93">right compared to all the others can you</text>
  <text start="499.35" dur="5.67">imagine if this was happening in other</text>
  <text start="502.22" dur="4.81">subprime lenders which most likely it is</text>
  <text start="505.02" dur="5.66">doesn&amp;#39;t this remind you of something</text>
  <text start="507.03" dur="5.85">oh yeah the subprime securities where</text>
  <text start="510.68" dur="4.96">the rating agencies said they were</text>
  <text start="512.88" dur="5.25">triple-a and actually what was being</text>
  <text start="515.64" dur="3.9">hidden from the public was that all the</text>
  <text start="518.13" dur="5.07">loans inside of these subprime</text>
  <text start="519.54" dur="4.8">securities they were defaulting well it</text>
  <text start="523.2" dur="4.56">looks like the same thing is happening</text>
  <text start="524.34" dur="5.73">once again so what is the exposure to</text>
  <text start="527.76" dur="4.74">all of this well it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="530.07" dur="5.16">say but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="532.5" dur="5.76">that it&amp;#39;s not just auto loans but</text>
  <text start="535.23" dur="6.21">subprime mortgages and subprime consumer</text>
  <text start="538.26" dur="6.21">loans and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="6.12">that there are a huge amount of problems</text>
  <text start="544.47" dur="5.73">now if we look at the non banks lenders</text>
  <text start="547.56" dur="4.62">they have surged six-fold since the</text>
  <text start="550.2" dur="4.11">financial crisis - nearly three hundred</text>
  <text start="552.18" dur="5.37">and forty five billion at the end of</text>
  <text start="554.31" dur="6.39">2017 here are the top contenders Wells</text>
  <text start="557.55" dur="4.71">Fargo eighty 1 billion Citigroup thirty</text>
  <text start="560.7" dur="4.2">billion Bank of America 30 billion</text>
  <text start="562.26" dur="5.85">JPMorgan Chase 28 billion goldman sachs</text>
  <text start="564.9" dur="4.86">22 billion morgan stanley 16 billion we</text>
  <text start="568.11" dur="3.99">still don&amp;#39;t fully understand the</text>
  <text start="569.76" dur="4.92">magnitude of it even the banks might not</text>
  <text start="572.1" dur="4.59">Bank of America is finding out in the</text>
  <text start="574.68" dur="4.32">summit bankruptcy what has been going on</text>
  <text start="576.69" dur="5.82">here and this is going to trickle down</text>
  <text start="579" dur="7.02">to all the other banks and when all said</text>
  <text start="582.51" dur="4.05">and done we&amp;#39;re gonna find out that a lot</text>
  <text start="586.02" dur="2.7">of thing</text>
  <text start="586.56" dur="3.99">have been happening behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="588.72" dur="5.01">just like in the subprime securities and</text>
  <text start="590.55" dur="7.68">were already starting to see this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="593.73" dur="6.89">seeing the mortgage refiled to the</text>
  <text start="598.23" dur="5.4">lowest since the financial crisis and</text>
  <text start="600.62" dur="5.8">things are not improving right now we</text>
  <text start="603.63" dur="5.61">see that the coming from the mortgage</text>
  <text start="606.42" dur="4.83">banker Association data mortgage demand</text>
  <text start="609.24" dur="4.11">continues to slide and last week</text>
  <text start="611.25" dur="6.3">mortgage application volumes slumped</text>
  <text start="613.35" dur="6.81">another 1.9 percent and even though the</text>
  <text start="617.55" dur="5.66">rates dipped a little bit it still looks</text>
  <text start="620.16" dur="5.16">like applications are declining and</text>
  <text start="623.21" dur="4.9">initial purchase applications have</text>
  <text start="625.32" dur="5.34">dropped by 2 percent this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="628.11" dur="4.68">starting to fall apart and when you look</text>
  <text start="630.66" dur="4.32">at the Mortgage Bankers Association and</text>
  <text start="632.79" dur="9.18">you look at their graph it has been on a</text>
  <text start="634.98" dur="8.76">downward trend since 2013 and it looks</text>
  <text start="641.97" dur="3.78">like it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="643.74" dur="4.98">time goes on now the Mortgage Bankers</text>
  <text start="645.75" dur="6.18">Association expects nothing short of a</text>
  <text start="648.72" dur="6.869">bloodbath it forecasts overall mortgage</text>
  <text start="651.93" dur="7.44">purchase volume to grow about 5% in 2018</text>
  <text start="655.589" dur="6.061">but refinancing volume to drop by 27%</text>
  <text start="659.37" dur="5.04">and I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot worse</text>
  <text start="661.65" dur="4.14">than this when we look at Wells Fargo we</text>
  <text start="664.41" dur="3.33">can see that residential mortgage</text>
  <text start="665.79" dur="5.31">applications they have been declining</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="4.98">over time since 2013 and it looks like</text>
  <text start="671.1" dur="4.29">the situation is just getting worse and</text>
  <text start="672.72" dur="4.38">worse and as interest rates move up the</text>
  <text start="675.39" dur="4.5">whole thing is just going to get a lot</text>
  <text start="677.1" dur="6.239">worse as time goes on we&amp;#39;re also seeing</text>
  <text start="679.89" dur="6.12">that there are trend cycles that are</text>

  <text start="857.67" dur="3.99">instance they&amp;#39;ve gotten rid of a lot of</text>
  <text start="860.19" dur="3.36">the bankers they threw him into jail</text>
  <text start="861.66" dur="4.59">they took control of their economy</text>
  <text start="863.55" dur="4.32">same thing with Russia they took control</text>
  <text start="866.25" dur="3.99">of the private western central bank and</text>
  <text start="867.87" dur="5.37">their economies are doing very well</text>
  <text start="870.24" dur="4.95">those countries that listen to the</text>
  <text start="873.24" dur="3.33">central bank they have a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="875.19" dur="4.259">debt they have a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="876.57" dur="6.86">austerity and they&amp;#39;re not doing well the</text>
  <text start="879.449" dur="7.89">central bankers biggest worry is that if</text>
  <text start="883.43" dur="6.13">there&amp;#39;s a country that is not working</text>
  <text start="887.339" dur="4.471">with the sent a private western central</text>
  <text start="889.56" dur="4.889">bank and they do very well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="891.81" dur="5.04">afraid the rest of the world is going to</text>
  <text start="894.449" dur="3.45">see this and say why do we need the</text>
  <text start="896.85" dur="2.729">central banks that&amp;#39;s why all those</text>
  <text start="897.899" dur="3.031">countries that don&amp;#39;t have a private</text>
  <text start="899.579" dur="3.391">western central bank that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="900.93" dur="3.899">sanctions are placed on them that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="902.97" dur="3.809">they&amp;#39;re the enemies that&amp;#39;s why they keep</text>
  <text start="904.829" dur="3.57">this up now the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="906.779" dur="3.3">make sure that they don&amp;#39;t destroy a</text>
  <text start="908.399" dur="3.481">country they keep them in limbo they</text>
  <text start="910.079" dur="3.781">make sure they have a lot of credit they</text>
  <text start="911.88" dur="4.38">make sure there&amp;#39;s austerity but they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="913.86" dur="3.81">never allow the country to go down</text>
  <text start="916.26" dur="3.6">because then the rest of the world will</text>
  <text start="917.67" dur="4.919">look at it and say whoa under the</text>
  <text start="919.86" dur="4.5">central banking rule they destroyed this</text>
  <text start="922.589" dur="3.961">country that will not let that happen</text>
  <text start="924.36" dur="4.349">they will always make sure that they</text>
  <text start="926.55" dur="4.38">strike some type of deal where the</text>
  <text start="928.709" dur="3.99">country never folds and they want to</text>
  <text start="930.93" dur="4.68">make sure that you never see those</text>
  <text start="932.699" dur="5.221">countries without a central bank this is</text>
  <text start="935.61" dur="4.5">why like I said they put sanctions on</text>
  <text start="937.92" dur="3.93">them this is why they&amp;#39;re the enemy but</text>
  <text start="940.11" dur="3.209">if you look at Russia even though they</text>
  <text start="941.85" dur="4.679">play sanctions on certain individuals</text>
  <text start="943.319" dur="5.491">the country is doing very well they have</text>
  <text start="946.529" dur="3.721">a very little bit of debt they&amp;#39;ve taken</text>
  <text start="948.81" dur="3.269">control of the private western central</text>
  <text start="950.25" dur="4.019">bank they have a lot of gold they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="952.079" dur="3.81">continually purchasing gold and we could</text>
  <text start="954.269" dur="2.221">see at this point that as we move</text>
  <text start="955.889" dur="3.121">forward</text>
  <text start="956.49" dur="4.709">a lot of the globalist infrastructure</text>
  <text start="959.01" dur="5.49">that they put into place well it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="961.199" dur="5.491">start to rip itself apart and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="964.5" dur="5.01">already starting to see this the central</text>
  <text start="966.69" dur="5.31">banks are already out there letting</text>
  <text start="969.51" dur="5.1">everyone know that if Trump continues in</text>
  <text start="972" dur="5.819">this way that this is going to destroy</text>
  <text start="974.61" dur="5.49">their system remember it&amp;#39;s their system</text>
  <text start="977.819" dur="5.13">that they created to benefit them this</text>
  <text start="980.1" dur="4.65">is not a system for the people so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="982.949" dur="4.44">headed towards a transition</text>
  <text start="984.75" dur="4.589">it&amp;#39;s coming very very quickly the banks</text>
  <text start="987.389" dur="4.26">are worried about cryptocurrency they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="989.339" dur="3.901">worried about that this is gonna put</text>
  <text start="991.649" dur="2.911">them out of business because again if</text>
  <text start="993.24" dur="3.659">you&amp;#39;re using cryptocurrency the</text>
  <text start="994.56" dur="4.56">blockchain there&amp;#39;s really no reason for</text>
  <text start="996.899" dur="4.201">the banking system because you can do</text>
  <text start="999.12" dur="4.199">things in all different ways actually I</text>
  <text start="1001.1" dur="5.9">was just reading an article about a new</text>
  <text start="1003.319" dur="7.861">cryptocurrency that will allow you to</text>
  <text start="1007" dur="6.16">purchase real estate and not go through</text>
  <text start="1011.18" dur="4.469">the banks whatsoever everything&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="1013.16" dur="5.64">on the blockchain and there&amp;#39;s no need</text>
  <text start="1015.649" dur="5.971">for the banking system and I think as</text>
  <text start="1018.8" dur="5.97">time goes on we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more</text>
  <text start="1021.62" dur="4.919">of this and this is why the the</text>
  <text start="1024.77" dur="4.139">banksters came out with their report</text>
  <text start="1026.539" dur="4.561">saying that you know cryptocurrency is a</text>
  <text start="1028.909" dur="4.65">threat to their business we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="1031.1" dur="3.989">through this transition and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1033.559" dur="3.811">to take a certain period of time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1035.089" dur="4.381">gonna it&amp;#39;s gonna hurt just like when we</text>
  <text start="1037.37" dur="3.87">went from the gold standard off to the</text>
  <text start="1039.47" dur="3.66">petrodollar again we were still the</text>

  <text start="1044.99" dur="4.38">going to be the reserve currency anymore</text>
  <text start="1047" dur="3.96">so it&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot more pain because</text>
  <text start="1049.37" dur="3.27">we have a lot more debt we have a lot</text>
  <text start="1050.96" dur="3.81">more derivatives we have a lot more of</text>
  <text start="1052.64" dur="4.74">everything that we probably need exist</text>
