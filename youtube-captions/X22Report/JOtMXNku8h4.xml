  <text start="124.27" dur="5.609">major changes around the world and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="126.4" dur="5.55">been talking about how the people they</text>
  <text start="129.879" dur="4.741">started to realize they started to</text>
  <text start="131.95" dur="6.45">recognize that the direction we were all</text>
  <text start="134.62" dur="6.6">headed in is not a good direction that</text>
  <text start="138.4" dur="3.63">globalism having the central bank in</text>
  <text start="141.22" dur="3.9">control</text>
  <text start="142.03" dur="4.89">having the elite telling us what we</text>
  <text start="145.12" dur="3.78">should believe in what we should do and</text>
  <text start="146.92" dur="5.67">not really telling us the truth about</text>
  <text start="148.9" dur="6.66">what their actual plans were well the</text>
  <text start="152.59" dur="5.399">people they&amp;#39;re starting to wake up and</text>
  <text start="155.56" dur="5.759">this is spreading around the world I</text>
  <text start="157.989" dur="6.661">mean look at France for instance lepen</text>
  <text start="161.319" dur="7.021">she is basically beating out Makram</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="7.229">McCrone his ratings are down the tubes</text>
  <text start="168.34" dur="7.349">people realize and understand that these</text>
  <text start="171.879" dur="7.681">are not leaders of the people they are</text>
  <text start="175.689" dur="5.761">the leaders for the central bank the</text>
  <text start="179.56" dur="4.89">leaders for the elite for the</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="5.58">establishment and everything is changing</text>
  <text start="184.45" dur="5.73">and this is why Trump is working so hard</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="5.489">right now to create these new trade</text>
  <text start="190.18" dur="5.279">deals to create everything because they</text>
  <text start="192.519" dur="6.09">know that once we move out of this</text>
  <text start="195.459" dur="5.64">central bank system it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="198.609" dur="4.141">very bumpy and everything needs to be in</text>
  <text start="201.099" dur="4.95">place remember they&amp;#39;ve been removing</text>
  <text start="202.75" dur="5.909">everything for a very long time Trump</text>
  <text start="206.049" dur="5.821">right now is out in Japan and he is</text>
  <text start="208.659" dur="6.571">meeting with Shinzo Abe a and he is</text>
  <text start="211.87" dur="7.049">wasting no time lashing out at what he</text>
  <text start="215.23" dur="5.25">sees as an imbalance between the pair we</text>
  <text start="218.919" dur="4.141">have a problem with trade we have a</text>
  <text start="220.48" dur="4.439">problem with trade everywhere this is</text>
  <text start="223.06" dur="3.599">the way the elite the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.919" dur="4.111">wanted it they wanted the other</text>
  <text start="226.659" dur="4.23">countries to benefit and the United</text>
  <text start="229.03" dur="3.72">States not to because eventually that</text>
  <text start="230.889" dur="3.27">what they were going to do is they were</text>
  <text start="232.75" dur="2.629">going to shift everything away from the</text>
  <text start="234.159" dur="3.991">United States and it&amp;#39;s pretty evident</text>
  <text start="235.379" dur="5.32">company is manufacturing everything was</text>
  <text start="238.15" dur="4.739">being moved away and this was being done</text>
  <text start="240.699" dur="5.43">on purpose and this is why they made</text>
  <text start="242.889" dur="5.94">terrible trade deals this way they can</text>
  <text start="246.129" dur="6.36">bring down the u.s. down to the level of</text>
  <text start="248.829" dur="6.03">a third world nation and Trump now is</text>
  <text start="252.489" dur="5.131">dealing with a bay out in Japan and</text>
  <text start="254.859" dur="7.501">saying that we need to have fair trade</text>
  <text start="257.62" dur="7.53">and he said Japan has had a substantial</text>
  <text start="262.36" dur="6.059">edge for many years but that&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="5.449">maybe that&amp;#39;s why you like us so much mr.</text>
  <text start="268.419" dur="4.951">Trump told some of the Japanese leaders</text>
  <text start="270.599" dur="5.32">including Toyota Honda and Nissan that</text>
  <text start="273.37" dur="4.47">we need to start changing things and we</text>
  <text start="275.919" dur="4.891">need to make it a little bit more fair</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="4.74">and he continued with this deal we hope</text>
  <text start="280.81" dur="2.789">to address the trade imbalance remove</text>
  <text start="282.58" dur="3.36">the barriers to the United States</text>
  <text start="283.599" dur="4.801">exports and ensure fairness and</text>
  <text start="285.94" dur="4.83">reciprocity in our relationship we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.4" dur="4.68">getting close he continued we hope to</text>
  <text start="290.77" dur="4.35">have a several further announcement soon</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="4.98">and some very big ones</text>
  <text start="295.12" dur="6.99">over the next few months and we see that</text>
  <text start="298.06" dur="6.329">things absolutely need to change and</text>
  <text start="302.11" dur="4.29">this is why Trump is making all these</text>
  <text start="304.389" dur="5.361">bilateral trade agreements around the</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="7.079">world not following the globalist agenda</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="4.69">we see the European Central Bank well</text>
  <text start="313.479" dur="4.231">they&amp;#39;re gonna be in a little bit of</text>
  <text start="314.44" dur="6.09">trouble here president mario draghi he</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="5.58">is set to step down from his role later</text>
  <text start="320.53" dur="5.43">this year and EU officials economists</text>
  <text start="323.29" dur="4.71">and observers are debating who would be</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="4.23">his likely successor and how this power</text>
  <text start="328" dur="5.76">transition will affect the course of</text>
  <text start="330.19" dur="5.479">monetary policy in the eurozone now we</text>
  <text start="333.76" dur="6.51">have another individual stepping down</text>
  <text start="335.669" dur="8.921">from the central bank system we need a</text>
  <text start="340.27" dur="7.11">patriot in there that believes in sound</text>
  <text start="344.59" dur="5.07">money just like Trump is trying to put</text>
  <text start="347.38" dur="7.71">people into the Fed we need people in</text>
  <text start="349.66" dur="8.819">the ECB the EU and they need to push</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="5.31">sound money if we can get a coordinated</text>
  <text start="358.479" dur="5.221">effort where there are Patriots in all</text>
  <text start="360.4" dur="5.61">these positions change can completely</text>
  <text start="363.7" dur="4.589">happen and when I&amp;#39;m say change I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="366.01" dur="5.76">talking about bringing down the central</text>
  <text start="368.289" dur="5.791">bank system and they&amp;#39;re looking at many</text>
  <text start="371.77" dur="4.769">different individuals nothing set as of</text>
  <text start="374.08" dur="5.519">yet but you can see that it is happening</text>
  <text start="376.539" dur="5.431">around the world now like we said in</text>
  <text start="379.599" dur="6.061">other reports Trump is going to continue</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="6.569">to jab at the Fed and this is going to</text>
  <text start="385.66" dur="6.81">accelerate well it looks like he is</text>
  <text start="388.539" dur="6.481">right on track it looks like he is doing</text>
  <text start="392.47" dur="5.46">exactly what we thought he was going to</text>
  <text start="395.02" dur="8.19">do he&amp;#39;s in Japan and he decided to take</text>
  <text start="397.93" dur="7.95">a swipe at the Fed and he said that the</text>
  <text start="403.21" dur="5.1">stock market would be as much as 10,000</text>
  <text start="405.88" dur="4.86">points higher had the board kept</text>
  <text start="408.31" dur="5.359">interest rates steady saying US growth</text>
  <text start="410.74" dur="6.33">could have also exceeded three percent</text>
  <text start="413.669" dur="6.151">now Trump is doing this on purpose like</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;ve said many many times before this</text>
  <text start="419.82" dur="4.48">mission to get rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="422.56" dur="4.68">this is going to be one of the hardest</text>
  <text start="424.3" dur="4.26">things the Patriots are going to come up</text>
  <text start="427.24" dur="3.87">against</text>
  <text start="428.56" dur="5.19">much harder than arresting those people</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="6.48">for treason because the central bank</text>
  <text start="433.75" dur="5.82">remember they&amp;#39;re not part of the US</text>
  <text start="437.59" dur="4.56">system they&amp;#39;re not part of any country</text>
  <text start="439.57" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re separate and apart and they do</text>
  <text start="442.15" dur="4.35">believe that they are above the laws</text>
  <text start="443.95" dur="5.19">that the laws cannot affect them and</text>
  <text start="446.5" dur="3.87">remember they do have control over each</text>
  <text start="449.14" dur="3.21">and every country because a lot of</text>
  <text start="450.37" dur="5.07">countries are in debt this is their</text>
  <text start="452.35" dur="8.34">weapon it&amp;#39;s not nuclear weapons it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="455.44" dur="7.86">you know bombs what they use is debt</text>
  <text start="460.69" dur="4.95">debt is their weapon and this is how</text>
  <text start="463.3" dur="4.86">they can control governments this is how</text>
  <text start="465.64" dur="5.37">they can control people and this is a</text>
  <text start="468.16" dur="4.23">much more powerful weapon than a nuclear</text>
  <text start="471.01" dur="5.46">weapon a nuclear weapon just wipes</text>
  <text start="472.39" dur="6.21">everything out this weapon controls the</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="2.76">people and the government&amp;#39;s that exist</text>
  <text start="478.6" dur="3.63">today</text>
  <text start="479.23" dur="6.42">and Trump is going to need a coordinated</text>
  <text start="482.23" dur="4.71">effort to remove the central bank think</text>
  <text start="485.65" dur="4.8">about what&amp;#39;s happening around the world</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="7.229">right now the elite leaders in all these</text>
  <text start="490.45" dur="6.75">countries one by one they are losing</text>
  <text start="494.169" dur="4.771">this is the first step actually it&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="497.2" dur="4.2">know many steps beyond the first step</text>
  <text start="498.94" dur="4.62">but this is the one of the major first</text>
  <text start="501.4" dur="4.829">steps that needs to happen</text>
  <text start="503.56" dur="5.25">the other one was Trump being elected</text>
  <text start="506.229" dur="4.471">and removing a lot of the globalist</text>
  <text start="508.81" dur="4.409">trade deals or reworking a lot of the</text>
  <text start="510.7" dur="6.42">globalist trade deals and getting all</text>
  <text start="513.219" dur="5.341">these countries on board if you really</text>
  <text start="517.12" dur="4.77">watch what he&amp;#39;s doing and you watch what</text>
  <text start="518.56" dur="6.029">the world is doing right now the world</text>
  <text start="521.89" dur="5.73">is going up against the elite the</text>
  <text start="524.589" dur="5.791">central bank and it&amp;#39;s happening all at</text>
  <text start="527.62" dur="5.46">once in real time and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="530.38" dur="5.49">many many other countries step up to the</text>
  <text start="533.08" dur="5.84">plate I mean think about just go back a</text>
  <text start="535.87" dur="5.76">year or two look how much has changed</text>
  <text start="538.92" dur="4.48">look where we are today yes I know</text>
  <text start="541.63" dur="4.59">people wanted things that happen you</text>
  <text start="543.4" dur="5.34">know yesterday but this is part of a</text>
  <text start="546.22" dur="5.76">major plan and the plan had to be</text>
  <text start="548.74" dur="6.75">executed just right because we only have</text>
  <text start="551.98" dur="6.03">one chance at this and it looks like it</text>
  <text start="555.49" dur="5.219">is working I mean look at Angela Merkel</text>
  <text start="558.01" dur="4.38">in Germany she&amp;#39;s sweating it out she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.709" dur="3.541">saying now the u.s. is part of</text>
  <text start="562.39" dur="4.83">China and Russia we&amp;#39;re gonna lump them</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="4.92">all together because they&amp;#39;re not with us</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="4.53">anymore and guess what</text>
  <text start="569.17" dur="6.26">Italy is not with them Australia is not</text>
  <text start="571.75" dur="6.63">with them the UK is not with them</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="4.84">Hungary is not with them and many other</text>
  <text start="578.38" dur="4.38">countries and a lot of countries are</text>
  <text start="580.27" dur="4.98">gonna start pulling away once the brexit</text>
  <text start="582.76" dur="4.47">happens in the UK you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="585.25" dur="3.69">many many countries start to pull away</text>
  <text start="587.23" dur="3.3">and this is what the central bank has</text>
  <text start="588.94" dur="4.89">been trying to stop because they know</text>
  <text start="590.53" dur="6.21">that once this happens it&amp;#39;s game over</text>
  <text start="593.83" dur="6.78">for them and they&amp;#39;re already seeing it</text>
  <text start="596.74" dur="6.57">it is game over so we are headed in the</text>
  <text start="600.61" dur="5.79">right direction there are moves and</text>
  <text start="603.31" dur="5.76">countermoves and the people are taking</text>
  <text start="606.4" dur="5.4">control we are headed towards a new</text>
  <text start="609.07" dur="4.77">economic structure this structure is not</text>
  <text start="611.8" dur="4.68">going to be based around a central bank</text>
  <text start="613.84" dur="5.91">this structure is going to be based</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="5.85">around what the people want and they</text>
  <text start="619.75" dur="6.03">want a sound money system the everyday</text>
  <text start="622.33" dur="5.88">person what do they really want they</text>
  <text start="625.78" dur="4.77">want to earn a living provide for their</text>
  <text start="628.21" dur="3.95">family and they&amp;#39;d rather not see</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="4.86">everything that they&amp;#39;ve earned</text>
  <text start="632.16" dur="5.44">completely be wiped out because of the</text>
  <text start="635.41" dur="4.29">dollar losing its value every single day</text>
  <text start="637.6" dur="4.29">why do you think Congress put the</text>
  <text start="639.7" dur="4.44">mandate on the Fed where there should be</text>
  <text start="641.89" dur="5.01">no inflation which means the value of</text>
  <text start="644.14" dur="5.85">the dollar doesn&amp;#39;t lose its value and we</text>
  <text start="646.9" dur="5.22">should have full employment there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="649.99" dur="5.97">reason for that because this is what the</text>
  <text start="652.12" dur="5.88">everyday person on the street wants they</text>
  <text start="655.96" dur="3.45">want to have a job and everything that</text>
  <text start="658" dur="3.66">they earn they don&amp;#39;t want it to</text>
  <text start="659.41" dur="4.26">disappear they don&amp;#39;t want these cycles</text>
  <text start="661.66" dur="3.96">these booms and busts they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
