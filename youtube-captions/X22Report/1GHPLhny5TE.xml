  <text start="42.03" dur="3.239">been talking about walmart how their</text>
  <text start="43.5" dur="4.44">business model is based on the SNAP</text>
  <text start="45.269" dur="6.991">program this is the food stamp program</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="8.899">and what we&amp;#39;re finding out is that the</text>
  <text start="52.26" dur="7.14">everyday person is a lot poorer than</text>
  <text start="56.839" dur="5.081">everyone really thinks and I have to</text>
  <text start="59.4" dur="4.92">thank Joe who sent me this link to this</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="5.91">article and what I&amp;#39;m going to explain</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="6.6">what this is we know that Walmart</text>
  <text start="67.83" dur="5.179">depends on the SNAP program but what</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="5.129">they&amp;#39;re seeing is that the overall</text>
  <text start="73.009" dur="6.451">shopper even the people who are not on</text>
  <text start="76.049" dur="6.6">the SNAP program are much poorer than</text>
  <text start="79.46" dur="8.13">everyone realizes they don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="82.649" dur="7.231">disposable income to pay for that extra</text>
  <text start="87.59" dur="6.97">merchandise and this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="7.04">a decline in retail at this point and we</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="4.949">have to remember there are an estimated</text>
  <text start="96.92" dur="5.409">48 million Americans who are receiving</text>
  <text start="99.509" dur="5.22">food stamps right now while roughly</text>
  <text start="102.329" dur="5.25">eighty percent of us consumers shop at</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="5.07">Walmart at some point during the year</text>
  <text start="107.579" dur="5.1">and what they&amp;#39;re seeing is that these</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="4.71">people even if they&amp;#39;re not on the food</text>
  <text start="112.679" dur="4.591">stamp program they have budgetary</text>
  <text start="114.509" dur="4.771">constraints and they can&amp;#39;t afford to go</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="4.049">out and buy the other merchandise and</text>
  <text start="119.28" dur="3.659">this goes on to say that 10 years ago</text>
  <text start="121.319" dur="4.08">roughly fifty percent of Walmart</text>
  <text start="122.939" dur="4.441">shoppers cited low prices as the most</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="4.201">important reason to shop at Walmart</text>
  <text start="127.38" dur="4.89">today that number is seventy-five</text>
  <text start="129.6" dur="5.219">percent because people are looking for</text>
  <text start="132.27" dur="5.279">cheaper items lower prices because they</text>
  <text start="134.819" dur="6.211">don&amp;#39;t have that disposable income they</text>
  <text start="137.549" dur="6.091">don&amp;#39;t have the jobs they don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="5.19">full time high paying job because what</text>
  <text start="143.64" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re seeing is many of the big</text>
  <text start="146.22" dur="6.51">corporations laying off right now and</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="6.39">it&amp;#39;s hurting the entire middle class and</text>

  <text start="155.43" dur="4.71">class into the poor and we are</text>
  <text start="158.25" dur="4.41">definitely seeing this am right now the</text>
  <text start="160.14" dur="4.5">struggle is universal for all retails</text>
  <text start="162.66" dur="5.52">and this is why we see these stores</text>
  <text start="164.64" dur="6.69">closing and sales are down around eight</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="6.99">to ten percent from the first of this</text>
  <text start="171.33" dur="6">year across all retailers so everyone is</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="4.89">having the same problem and this is not</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="4.14">going to get better because of all the</text>
  <text start="180.06" dur="4.79">announcements from the beginning of this</text>
  <text start="181.47" dur="7.5">year you know Adele 15,000 people Sony</text>

  <text start="203.459" dur="6.361">laying off stores are closing and these</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="6.15">jobs are also disappearing and what</text>
  <text start="209.82" dur="5.43">Walmart didn&amp;#39;t just reveal how poor its</text>
  <text start="212.82" dur="6.06">customers really are it revealed just</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="7.17">how poor so many us shoppers are and</text>
  <text start="218.88" dur="5.88">this is the entire point is that every</text>
  <text start="222.42" dur="4.65">single American out there who is</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="5.16">struggling who couldn&amp;#39;t get that job</text>

  <text start="242.04" dur="3.72">been out there where people don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="244.32" dur="3.15">see it and all these numbers have been</text>
  <text start="245.76" dur="5.25">manipulated and people don&amp;#39;t know this</text>
  <text start="247.47" dur="4.829">and again they realize this the and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="3.03">when I say they I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="252.299" dur="3.81">central bankers US government they</text>
  <text start="254.04" dur="4.919">realize that this collapse is coming and</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="4.35">they don&amp;#39;t they need to get this war</text>
  <text start="258.959" dur="3.721">this event started because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="5.101">want to be blamed on for for this</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="6.32">collapse and before this collapse</text>
  <text start="265.56" dur="8.37">happens they desperately desperately</text>

  <text start="273.93" dur="3.75">American people</text>
  <text start="274.98" dur="6.87">and what has happened right now is that</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="6.81">President Obama was at a summit a us-eu</text>
  <text start="281.85" dur="4.32">summit held this week in Brussels and</text>
  <text start="284.49" dur="3.84">President Obama and his European</text>

  <text start="327.93" dur="5.1">privately-owned weapons and ammunition</text>
  <text start="329.6" dur="5.86">President Obama quietly signed his name</text>
  <text start="333.03" dur="4.68">to a document that if carried out would</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="4.59">amount to nothing less than the de facto</text>
  <text start="337.71" dur="4.89">repeal of the Second Amendment and we</text>
  <text start="340.05" dur="7.2">have to remember this they just can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="342.6" dur="7.77">ahead and repeal an amendment the United</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="5.67">States has to have a majority vote from</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="4.38">all the states with another amendment to</text>

  <text start="354.75" dur="4.41">signed something does not remove an</text>
  <text start="357.03" dur="3.72">amendment but this went on to say and</text>
  <text start="359.16" dur="4.59">this is coming out of the new American</text>
  <text start="360.75" dur="5.1">article 2 of the treaty defined the</text>

  <text start="381.99" dur="4.53">women within this game now think about</text>
  <text start="384.39" dur="4.26">this for a second they already knew they</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="5.63">were doing this look at President</text>
  <text start="388.65" dur="6.81">Obama&amp;#39;s executive orders they match this</text>
  <text start="392.15" dur="5.95">exactly they already knew they were</text>
  <text start="395.46" dur="6.15">going to push this agenda Ford for a</text>
  <text start="398.1" dur="6.72">long time I mean just look we have the</text>
  <text start="401.61" dur="5.01">UN arms treaty pending in the Senate</text>
  <text start="404.82" dur="3.69">right now was signed by John Kerry it is</text>
  <text start="406.62" dur="3.75">pending on us in the Senate</text>
  <text start="408.51" dur="4.8">and they are going to vote on this but</text>
  <text start="410.37" dur="4.98">before they do we know what the central</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="4.74">bankers the US government is going to do</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="5.22">they are going to create a false flag to</text>
  <text start="418.05" dur="3.63">help push this forward and this is why</text>
  <text start="420.57" dur="2.94">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing all these mass</text>
  <text start="421.68" dur="4.95">shootings this is why we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="423.51" dur="5.94">everything going on at this time now 50</text>
  <text start="426.63" dur="4.77">senators are standing together to</text>
  <text start="429.45" dur="3.54">protect the right to keep and bear arms</text>
  <text start="431.4" dur="4.38">as guaranteed by the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="432.99" dur="5.13">and have taken pen in hand to let the</text>
  <text start="435.78" dur="4.83">president know how they feel about this</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="3.81">plan to rob their constituents of one of</text>
  <text start="440.61" dur="3.33">their most basic rights and of course</text>
  <text start="441.93" dur="4.14">they can&amp;#39;t rob us of our rights the</text>
  <text start="443.94" dur="3.72">rights belong to us they just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="446.07" dur="3.96">remove the Second Amendment because they</text>
  <text start="447.66" dur="5.25">you know enacted another law it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.03" dur="4.89">work that way the center&amp;#39;s the Senators</text>
  <text start="452.91" dur="4.01">enumerated six reason the president</text>
  <text start="454.92" dur="5.91">should refuse to present the eighth the</text>
  <text start="456.92" dur="6.22">the arms trade treaty to the Senate for</text>
  <text start="460.83" dur="5.1">ratification among the objections raised</text>
  <text start="463.14" dur="5.46">by the senatorial signatures is the</text>
  <text start="465.93" dur="4.5">ambiguity of the treaty as well as the</text>
  <text start="468.6" dur="5.13">grant to foreign sources of authority</text>
  <text start="470.43" dur="6.81">the power to impose judgment or control</text>
  <text start="473.73" dur="6.21">on the US again they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="477.24" dur="4.8">control and the ambiguity of this law</text>
  <text start="479.94" dur="3.75">doesn&amp;#39;t really tell us what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="482.04" dur="3.45">happen and we know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="483.69" dur="3.3">happen they&amp;#39;re going to try to disarm</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="5.22">every single person and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="486.99" dur="5.61">use the arms trade treaty for this and</text>
  <text start="490.71" dur="3.57">we know this for a fact and it seems</text>
  <text start="492.6" dur="4.35">that the strong partnership between</text>
  <text start="494.28" dur="5.28">European Union and the United States</text>
  <text start="496.95" dur="5.04">might be the wedge President Obama uses</text>
  <text start="499.56" dur="5.37">two separate Americans from their</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="6.15">firearms and their freedom and we can</text>
  <text start="504.93" dur="5.61">see they are definitely going ahead and</text>
  <text start="508.14" dur="5.16">they are definitely going to push this</text>
  <text start="510.54" dur="6.059">agenda forward because they understand</text>
  <text start="513.3" dur="5.85">that the dollar is collapsing at this</text>
  <text start="516.599" dur="5.791">time and they are desperately seeking to</text>
  <text start="519.15" dur="6.81">get this next event moved forward and we</text>
  <text start="522.39" dur="6.15">can see it&amp;#39;s the same oppositional group</text>
  <text start="525.96" dur="5.28">who is in Ukraine right now where they</text>
  <text start="528.54" dur="4.02">want to disarm the people in Ukraine the</text>
  <text start="531.24" dur="3.03">only reason they want to do this because</text>
  <text start="532.56" dur="5.58">they don&amp;#39;t want to lose their power it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.27" dur="6.42">the same in the US government they want</text>
  <text start="538.14" dur="4.23">the people disarmed because they want</text>
  <text start="540.69" dur="3.81">the power they do not want to lose</text>
  <text start="542.37" dur="4.92">it and they&amp;#39;re very nervous with</text>
  <text start="544.5" dur="4.77">Americans having weapons because if you</text>
  <text start="547.29" dur="4.77">have a weapon and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="549.27" dur="6.09">Americans who have weapons and they push</text>
  <text start="552.06" dur="5.13">into Washington they could remove the</text>
  <text start="555.36" dur="5.52">government just like we&amp;#39;ve seen in every</text>
  <text start="557.19" dur="5.399">single other country now right now what</text>
  <text start="560.88" dur="3.66">the United States is trying to do they</text>
  <text start="562.589" dur="2.94">are in talks with India and China and</text>
  <text start="564.54" dur="4.02">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is convince</text>
  <text start="565.529" dur="6.631">them to isolate Russia at this time and</text>
  <text start="568.56" dur="5.55">of course what they&amp;#39;re doing is is is</text>
  <text start="572.16" dur="4.56">because of Ukraine right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="5.19">trying to have them impose sanctions not</text>
  <text start="576.72" dur="4.41">to deal in trade with Russia at this</text>
  <text start="579.3" dur="3.84">time and it looks like they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="581.13" dur="3.209">really making that much of a headway at</text>
  <text start="583.14" dur="3.03">this time but they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="584.339" dur="5.19">continually push and push and push and</text>
  <text start="586.17" dur="6.3">we understand that this event that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="589.529" dur="5.071">coming is being pushed in Syria at this</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="4.8">time and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="594.6" dur="6.12">CIA is feeding intelligence information</text>
  <text start="597.27" dur="5.7">to rebel terrorists in Syria and what</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re doing is American spy satellites</text>
  <text start="602.97" dur="3.48">have been listening in on communications</text>
  <text start="604.68" dur="4.47">from Syrian government forces and</text>
  <text start="606.45" dur="5.19">passing that intelligence to rebels</text>

  <text start="611.64" dur="5.28">various British media report right now</text>
  <text start="613.8" dur="4.95">and serene generals giving orders on the</text>
