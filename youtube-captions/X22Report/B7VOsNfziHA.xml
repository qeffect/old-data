  <text start="57.88" dur="6.66">episode 1644 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is August</text>
  <text start="61.57" dur="5.52">21st 2018 and the tout of the episode is</text>
  <text start="64.54" dur="5.16">the global economy is overdue for a</text>
  <text start="67.09" dur="5.669">disaster and for many this will come as</text>
  <text start="69.7" dur="5.61">a shock let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.759" dur="4.171">collapse financial news now let&amp;#39;s start</text>
  <text start="75.31" dur="3.75">off today by talking about crypto</text>
  <text start="76.93" dur="4.5">currencies and we know that the central</text>
  <text start="79.06" dur="3.96">bank&amp;#39;s they do not like crypto</text>
  <text start="81.43" dur="3.299">currencies anything that goes up against</text>
  <text start="83.02" dur="2.82">their system they&amp;#39;re completely against</text>
  <text start="84.729" dur="5.971">I mean look at the precious metals</text>
  <text start="85.84" dur="7.889">market for years upon years since 1971</text>
  <text start="90.7" dur="5.91">when they took the entire currency</text>
  <text start="93.729" dur="4.111">system off the gold standard they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="96.61" dur="3.539">been telling us that gold is absolutely</text>
  <text start="97.84" dur="4.11">worthless you shouldn&amp;#39;t have it you</text>
  <text start="100.149" dur="3.181">shouldn&amp;#39;t own it and they&amp;#39;ve done this</text>
  <text start="101.95" dur="4.169">throughout the many years and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="103.33" dur="5.49">learned how to suppress it then all of a</text>
  <text start="106.119" dur="6.181">sudden in 2008 cryptocurrencies appear</text>
  <text start="108.82" dur="5.579">and you know there was nothing in the</text>
  <text start="112.3" dur="3.78">beginning and then started to build and</text>
  <text start="114.399" dur="5.481">they realize what cryptocurrencies could</text>
  <text start="116.08" dur="5.76">be and they took control over it by</text>
  <text start="119.88" dur="3.64">dumping a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="121.84" dur="3.96">cryptocurrencies on the market first</text>
  <text start="123.52" dur="5.7">they purchased a lot made it seem like</text>
  <text start="125.8" dur="5.73">everyone was in on it then they dumped</text>
  <text start="129.22" dur="4.71">them later on to bring the price down I</text>
  <text start="131.53" dur="4.5">mean let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="133.93" dur="4.2">isn&amp;#39;t this what they do in the stock</text>
  <text start="136.03" dur="5.01">market isn&amp;#39;t this what they do with</text>
  <text start="138.13" dur="5.73">every single market think about real</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="5.25">estate they pump it up they bring it</text>
  <text start="143.86" dur="3.9">down they pump it up they bring it down</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="5.01">they pretty much do it to everything</text>
  <text start="147.76" dur="5.97">even the entire economy they do this why</text>
  <text start="151.3" dur="4.1">because it makes people get out of it</text>
  <text start="153.73" dur="4.08">when they want them to get out of it</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="4.66">they demonize it when they need to</text>
  <text start="157.81" dur="4.08">demonize it and this is what we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="3.69">in the past but countries are looking at</text>
  <text start="161.89" dur="4.56">this and they&amp;#39;re saying you know</text>
  <text start="163.75" dur="5.129">something this is a way around the</text>
  <text start="166.45" dur="5.009">system that were in we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="168.879" dur="6.291">deal with the dollar there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="171.459" dur="5.851">for it and Turkey right now they are</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="3.19">taking their funds because of all the</text>
  <text start="177.31" dur="3.21">sanctions and everything else that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="178.36" dur="4.53">going on there and they&amp;#39;re moving their</text>
  <text start="180.52" dur="6.18">currency into crypto currencies about</text>
  <text start="182.89" dur="6.959">18% right now of consumers</text>
  <text start="186.7" dur="6.69">in Turkey have moved their currency and</text>
  <text start="189.849" dur="5.521">moved it into cryptocurrency now it</text>
  <text start="193.39" dur="4.23">doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a lot but when you</text>
  <text start="195.37" dur="4.53">start to look at the breakdown of all</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="4.68">the other countries even the US I mean</text>
  <text start="199.9" dur="4.98">everyone thought when Bitcoin was going</text>
  <text start="202.3" dur="5.88">up that everyone owned it no it was a</text>
  <text start="204.88" dur="5.79">very small number of individuals that</text>
  <text start="208.18" dur="4.919">owned it but we know that Mount Coxon</text>
  <text start="210.67" dur="4.89">many other players they were buying a</text>
  <text start="213.099" dur="4.051">lot of it to drive the prices up think</text>
  <text start="215.56" dur="4.38">about how they work the real estate</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="5.19">market how do you drive up prices there</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="3.9">well you hold on to all the inventory</text>
  <text start="222.34" dur="2.88">which the banks did you don&amp;#39;t foreclose</text>
  <text start="223.84" dur="3.36">on the houses you don&amp;#39;t put them out on</text>
  <text start="225.22" dur="4.26">the market you have hedge funds</text>
  <text start="227.2" dur="4.59">investment companies buy up the real</text>
  <text start="229.48" dur="4.95">estate hold on to it rent it if you can</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="6.71">but never sell it that drives the price</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="6.27">up stock market have a central bank</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="4.15">create currency out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="240.7" dur="5.039">shove it into the stock market to drive</text>
  <text start="242.65" dur="6.149">it up that&amp;#39;s what the Swiss National</text>
  <text start="245.739" dur="6.361">Bank has done the same thing happened</text>
  <text start="248.799" dur="5.041">with crypto currencies someone and we</text>
  <text start="252.1" dur="5.009">know who it is the central bank system</text>
  <text start="253.84" dur="7.139">the powers that be purchased a lot of it</text>
  <text start="257.109" dur="7.381">then they dumped it only 8% of Americans</text>
  <text start="260.979" dur="5.791">own crypto currencies and if you look at</text>
  <text start="264.49" dur="4.95">many of the other countries it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="5.22">lower than that this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="4.83">stages the reason why they did it</text>
  <text start="271.99" dur="4.59">ahead of time because they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="274.27" dur="4.709">people to realize what this was all</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="4.709">about then you want people to realize</text>
  <text start="278.979" dur="3.721">that this was an alternative just like</text>
  <text start="281.289" dur="3.511">the precious metals market if you speak</text>
  <text start="282.7" dur="3.99">to people about gold and silver they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="3.54">be like I don&amp;#39;t want to own that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.69" dur="5.19">no reason to and there&amp;#39;s a very small</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="7.34">population that owns gold and silver the</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="6.36">central bankers do this on purpose and</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="8.37">when you look at it you can see that</text>
  <text start="298.24" dur="8.67">this is a prime area to invest in why</text>
  <text start="304.05" dur="4.96">well think about it the price has</text>
  <text start="306.91" dur="4.35">already dropped they already pushed it</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="4.92">down not a lot of people own it right</text>
  <text start="311.26" dur="5.13">now and it&amp;#39;s at a very very low level</text>
  <text start="313.93" dur="4.77">and this is actually a great time to</text>
  <text start="316.39" dur="3.249">invest I mean this is my opinion when</text>
  <text start="318.7" dur="3.88">I&amp;#39;m looking at the quick</text>
  <text start="319.639" dur="3.691">currency market I mean think about the</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="4.139">stock market</text>
  <text start="323.33" dur="7.29">if stocks come down is that a good time</text>
  <text start="326.719" dur="6.301">to invest of course so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="330.62" dur="3.599">right now is that many people are</text>
  <text start="333.02" dur="3.269">starting to get into it and especially</text>
  <text start="334.219" dur="5.491">those countries that are in trouble they</text>
  <text start="336.289" dur="5.731">are moving their currency that is</text>
  <text start="339.71" dur="3.63">devaluing and they&amp;#39;re moving in into</text>
  <text start="342.02" dur="2.34">cryptocurrency because then you can move</text>
  <text start="343.34" dur="4.68">it out of the country and you can move</text>
  <text start="344.36" dur="4.919">it into another currency very easily and</text>
  <text start="348.02" dur="3.509">if you want to know more about this you</text>
  <text start="349.279" dur="4.17">can go to the x-22 report school calm</text>
  <text start="351.529" dur="4.35">this is a link that will bring you over</text>

  <text start="381.159" dur="8.62">system this is their trade system and</text>
  <text start="384.699" dur="10.75">Turkey is a fantastic candidate for the</text>
  <text start="389.779" dur="9.181">OBE or why because turkey connects the</text>
  <text start="395.449" dur="8.4">European and Asian markets and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="6.479">conduit to Europe from Asia and this is</text>
  <text start="403.849" dur="3.09">something that the Chinese would like</text>
  <text start="405.439" dur="3.54">and this is something that they need and</text>
  <text start="406.939" dur="3.51">it looks like turkey is moving in that</text>
  <text start="408.979" dur="3.18">direction if you notice with all these</text>
  <text start="410.449" dur="4.861">sanctions and everything that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="412.159" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s forcing countries to move towards</text>
  <text start="415.31" dur="5.069">China Russia to the one belt one Road</text>
  <text start="417.589" dur="5.281">move away from the dollar you start to</text>
  <text start="420.379" dur="4.681">think is this being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="5.88">because it&amp;#39;s starting to feel that way</text>
  <text start="425.06" dur="7.05">how do you destroy a system well you</text>
  <text start="428.75" dur="8.039">move everyone away from the dollar you</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="7.979">move everyone to another system you move</text>
  <text start="436.789" dur="5.701">everyone from everything that the</text>
  <text start="440.089" dur="4.92">central bankers control and remember</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="4.349">Russia has taken over their central bank</text>
  <text start="445.009" dur="5.13">system that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to be done</text>
  <text start="446.839" dur="5.521">here in the United States and to get</text>
  <text start="450.139" dur="3.15">this done well you start moving</text>
  <text start="452.36" dur="3.059">countries</text>
  <text start="453.289" dur="3.69">you start pushing them away you start</text>
  <text start="455.419" dur="3.571">pushing them into crypto currencies you</text>
  <text start="456.979" dur="5.701">start pushing them into other trade</text>
  <text start="458.99" dur="7.109">systems and these countries then move on</text>
  <text start="462.68" dur="7.409">to the new system away from the central</text>
  <text start="466.099" dur="7.141">banking system and this is where many of</text>

  <text start="476.149" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re moving on to the one belt one</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="8.549">road system remember the central bankers</text>
  <text start="481.969" dur="7.56">they wanted the TPP system where they</text>
  <text start="486.979" dur="4.53">had a court system above the governments</text>
  <text start="489.529" dur="4.26">of every single country this is what</text>
  <text start="491.509" dur="5.481">they were pushing for and they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="493.789" dur="5.731">get it we see here in the United States</text>
  <text start="496.99" dur="4.719">foreclosures they have risen for the</text>
  <text start="499.52" dur="5.869">first time in thirty six month and this</text>
  <text start="501.709" dur="7.02">is coming from Adam data solutions now</text>
  <text start="505.389" dur="5.89">foreclosures rose from a year ago in 96</text>
  <text start="508.729" dur="5.91">of the 219 metropolitan statistical</text>
  <text start="511.279" dur="6.42">areas or 44% of the market analyzed in</text>
  <text start="514.639" dur="5.301">the report 33 of those areas posted</text>
  <text start="517.699" dur="4.71">their third straight monthly increase</text>
  <text start="519.94" dur="5.259">metro area postings year-over-year</text>
  <text start="522.409" dur="5.071">increases in foreclosure started starts</text>

  <text start="532.37" dur="7.44">Pennsylvania up 10% Miami Florida up 29%</text>
  <text start="535.91" dur="6.71">San Francisco up 10% and what we see</text>
  <text start="539.81" dur="7.74">here right now is that it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="542.62" dur="6.25">starting as interest rates move up a lot</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="2.88">of people are kicked out of the market</text>
  <text start="548.87" dur="4.23">those people that have adjustable rate</text>
  <text start="550.43" dur="4.589">mortgages or type of mortgages that</text>
  <text start="553.1" dur="4.049">change with the interest rates they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.019" dur="4.05">going to get into trouble those people</text>
  <text start="557.149" dur="3.63">that were underwater they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="559.069" dur="3.931">stay underwater because the prices are</text>
  <text start="560.779" dur="4.471">starting to come down traffic is going</text>
  <text start="563" dur="3.779">to dry up because once the prices come</text>
  <text start="565.25" dur="2.639">down people really don&amp;#39;t want to sell</text>
  <text start="566.779" dur="4.74">because they were hoping to get that</text>
  <text start="567.889" dur="5.341">high set a sale price and now that</text>
  <text start="571.519" dur="3.901">they&amp;#39;re not getting it why sell right</text>
  <text start="573.23" dur="4.349">now let&amp;#39;s hold on to it and we&amp;#39;ll wait</text>
  <text start="575.42" dur="4.44">it out which means there&amp;#39;s a lot less</text>
  <text start="577.579" dur="5.31">houses on the market which means there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="579.86" dur="6.02">a lot less traffic and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="582.889" dur="4.261">see this right now we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="585.88" dur="4.27">2006</text>
  <text start="587.15" dur="6.21">going into 2007 and now we are seeing it</text>
  <text start="590.15" dur="8.09">because this entire real estate market</text>
  <text start="593.36" dur="8.04">is one gigantic illusion as a reminder</text>
  <text start="598.24" dur="5.86">housing and not the financial markets or</text>
  <text start="601.4" dur="5.61">stocks that has traditionally been the</text>
  <text start="604.1" dur="5.58">most relevant aspirational asset for the</text>
  <text start="607.01" dur="7.29">US middle-class and as such is the best</text>
  <text start="609.68" dur="7.65">indicator of economic prosperity because</text>
  <text start="614.3" dur="5.85">people invest in their homes they buy</text>
  <text start="617.33" dur="5.37">the real estate because later on they</text>
  <text start="620.15" dur="4.74">were hoping to sell this make a huge</text>
  <text start="622.7" dur="4.53">profit from the appreciation and use</text>
  <text start="624.89" dur="4.89">this for retirement so when the prices</text>
  <text start="627.23" dur="5.76">of homes come down and people go</text>
  <text start="629.78" dur="5.73">underwater they can&amp;#39;t use this for</text>
  <text start="632.99" dur="5.67">retirement their investment is worthless</text>
  <text start="635.51" dur="5.7">right now they can&amp;#39;t get their money out</text>
  <text start="638.66" dur="5.31">of the home and they&amp;#39;re stuck in the</text>
  <text start="641.21" dur="4.35">home and this is a very good sign to let</text>
  <text start="643.97" dur="4.02">us know where everything is moving</text>
  <text start="645.56" dur="6.63">remember the stock market it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.99" dur="7.02">absolutely meaningless now if you read</text>
  <text start="652.19" dur="6.38">between the lines you can hear many of</text>
  <text start="655.01" dur="6.3">the billionaires out there they are</text>
  <text start="658.57" dur="6.34">transmitting messages and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="916.11" dur="5.669">it just can&amp;#39;t happen and what you need</text>
  <text start="918.93" dur="5.37">to do is you need to continually create</text>

  <text start="1002.6" dur="2.25">any further</text>
  <text start="1003.32" dur="3.33">yes they might be able to push it along</text>
  <text start="1004.85" dur="3.54">a little bit longer but eventually</text>
  <text start="1006.65" dur="3.6">what&amp;#39;s going to happen it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1008.39" dur="3.63">crack and break we&amp;#39;re already seeing the</text>
  <text start="1010.25" dur="5.76">cracks we&amp;#39;re just waiting for the break</text>

  <text start="1016.01" dur="5.91">overdue for a disaster the central blank</text>
  <text start="1019.49" dur="6.09">bankers were planning on a disaster a</text>
  <text start="1021.92" dur="6.24">long time ago probably a year ago</text>
  <text start="1025.58" dur="5.82">because we would already be most likely</text>
  <text start="1028.16" dur="5.79">in some type of war some type of an</text>
  <text start="1031.4" dur="5.7">event where they&amp;#39;d be able to blame what</text>
  <text start="1033.95" dur="6.57">was happening on that event we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1037.1" dur="6.09">have that right now and there&amp;#39;s a battle</text>
  <text start="1040.52" dur="3.99">going on between both sides because the</text>
  <text start="1043.19" dur="5.01">central bankers they know if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1044.51" dur="5.46">blamed for this they&amp;#39;re done for because</text>
  <text start="1048.2" dur="5.55">that means they brought the global</text>
  <text start="1049.97" dur="5.85">economy down if the countries and that</text>
  <text start="1053.75" dur="5.04">people point the finger at the central</text>
  <text start="1055.82" dur="4.38">bank&amp;#39;s they lose they know this Trump</text>
  <text start="1058.79" dur="4.08">and the Patriots they&amp;#39;re pretty much</text>
  <text start="1060.2" dur="4.89">doing the same thing they&amp;#39;re pumping up</text>
  <text start="1062.87" dur="5.79">this economy using the same manipulation</text>
  <text start="1065.09" dur="7.59">that was used before but putting this</text>
  <text start="1068.66" dur="6.57">into overdrive to show the economy is</text>
  <text start="1072.68" dur="4.88">doing very very well to try to switch</text>
  <text start="1075.23" dur="5.22">the narrative onto the central banks</text>
  <text start="1077.56" dur="5.29">because they know that this economy it</text>
  <text start="1080.45" dur="6">can&amp;#39;t go much longer there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="1082.85" dur="5.34">left here the debt is too high if we</text>
  <text start="1086.45" dur="4.23">continually add more and more debt and</text>
  <text start="1088.19" dur="3.42">the tax receipts they aren&amp;#39;t increasing</text>
  <text start="1090.68" dur="2.31">think about it</text>
  <text start="1091.61" dur="3.36">think of how many people have part-time</text>
  <text start="1092.99" dur="3.6">jobs think aha think about how many</text>
  <text start="1094.97" dur="3.87">people are out of the labor market think</text>
  <text start="1096.59" dur="5.25">about how much of the manufacturing has</text>
  <text start="1098.84" dur="5.13">been moved out of the country yes you</text>
  <text start="1101.84" dur="6.09">can bring back a thousand or 2,000 jobs</text>
  <text start="1103.97" dur="6.21">but we lost millions and the factories</text>
  <text start="1107.93" dur="5.58">aren&amp;#39;t here they&amp;#39;re broken down</text>
  <text start="1110.18" dur="6.54">buildings with nothing in them and a lot</text>
  <text start="1113.51" dur="7.44">of them are turned into maybe lofts so</text>
  <text start="1116.72" dur="6.66">what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is both sides dry</text>
  <text start="1120.95" dur="5.37">in this economy and there&amp;#39;s no place for</text>
  <text start="1123.38" dur="5.58">the economy to go and they&amp;#39;re both</text>
  <text start="1126.32" dur="3.42">trying to gain the narrative to blame it</text>
  <text start="1128.96" dur="3.87">on each other</text>
  <text start="1129.74" dur="5.58">and if the central bank wins that</text>
  <text start="1132.83" dur="3.45">narrative well it&amp;#39;s going to be disaster</text>
  <text start="1135.32" dur="2.64">for the people and it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="1136.28" dur="4.5">complete shock because they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1137.96" dur="4.8">who gets hurt Trump in the Patriots well</text>
  <text start="1140.78" dur="3.99">they have other plans they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1142.76" dur="4.38">bring back manufacturing they&amp;#39;re trying</text>

  <text start="1147.14" dur="4.89">was they&amp;#39;re trying to switch everything</text>
  <text start="1150.14" dur="4.05">around most likely the US will</text>

  <text start="1168.92" dur="4.32">will have to join and I believe this is</text>
  <text start="1171.2" dur="3.99">where we&amp;#39;re moving towards because we</text>
