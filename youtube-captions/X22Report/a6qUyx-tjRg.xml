  <text start="42.81" dur="5.52">control of a rand banking system let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="46.35" dur="5.4">get right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="48.33" dur="6.45">financial news now today we saw a gold</text>
  <text start="51.75" dur="4.23">slammed back down once again and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="54.78" dur="4.89">very interesting about this a couple</text>
  <text start="55.98" dur="6.81">days before we had 18,000 contracts put</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="5.31">into the market sold off and it brought</text>
  <text start="62.79" dur="5.64">gold down yesterday with the IMP we had</text>
  <text start="64.98" dur="5.78">the FOMC minutes gold was brought down</text>
  <text start="68.43" dur="4.38">with that then we had today lacquer</text>
  <text start="70.76" dur="3.61">telling everyone that you know</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="4.98">everything is fine don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="74.37" dur="5.51">and gold has dropped even further but</text>
  <text start="77.79" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s very interesting is that people</text>
  <text start="79.88" dur="7.96">central banks countries they&amp;#39;re gobbling</text>
  <text start="83.31" dur="7.5">it up to me it looks like everything</text>
  <text start="87.84" dur="6.9">just went on sale silver went on sale</text>
  <text start="90.81" dur="5.28">gold went on sale and at this point</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="5.28">everyone should be thinking themselves</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="8.25">hmmm if they&amp;#39;re that desperate to push</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="6.54">gold down like they&amp;#39;ve been doing once</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="6.54">they lose control what is going to</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="7.02">happen it&amp;#39;s going to move up I mean if</text>
  <text start="110.88" dur="4.83">you look at the u.s. debt clock or down</text>
  <text start="113.58" dur="3.87">at the bottom right hand corner they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="5.58">using the calculation that they used</text>
  <text start="117.45" dur="7.59">back in 1913 with the m2 money supply</text>
  <text start="121.29" dur="5.7">and we see that gold right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="125.04" dur="4.71">estimating around seven thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="126.99" dur="4.019">per ounce silver they&amp;#39;re estimating</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="4.44">around seven hundred and seventy nine</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="7.351">dollars per ounce which is the true</text>
  <text start="134.19" dur="6.03">ratio between gold and silver and think</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="6.39">about how much you can purchase silver</text>
  <text start="140.22" dur="7.86">for right now so when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="8.58">can say to ourselves hmm maybe I should</text>
  <text start="148.08" dur="10.769">pick up some to ensure my wealth just in</text>
  <text start="153.33" dur="7.739">case something happens and we know that</text>
  <text start="158.849" dur="5.14">something will happen</text>
  <text start="161.069" dur="5.14">because we can see the manipulation we</text>
  <text start="163.989" dur="5.791">can see what the US government central</text>
  <text start="166.209" dur="6.601">bankers have been doing now the initial</text>
  <text start="169.78" dur="4.019">jobless claims they came out and I see</text>
  <text start="172.81" dur="3.48">all over the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.799" dur="5.851">saying oh look the trend is back going</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="5.49">down everything is fine less people are</text>
  <text start="179.65" dur="4.289">applying nothing to worry about actually</text>
  <text start="181.78" dur="5.459">the trend is not going down it is moving</text>
  <text start="183.939" dur="5.091">up at this point and again the initial</text>
  <text start="187.239" dur="4.98">jobless claims they don&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="6.659">because according to challenger gray &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="192.219" dur="6.751">christmas layoffs are continually</text>
  <text start="195.689" dur="6.821">trending upward but initial jobless</text>
  <text start="198.97" dur="5.28">claims according to the US government in</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="5.039">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="204.25" dur="6.269">downward something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="207.549" dur="6.06">someone is lying now we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="210.519" dur="6.06">about retail and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="213.609" dur="5.701">of stores come in with sales declining</text>
  <text start="216.579" dur="4.201">now Walmart came in and it&amp;#39;s all over</text>
  <text start="219.31" dur="3.299">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re making a</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="5.239">really big deal about this how Walmart</text>
  <text start="222.609" dur="5.97">surged 9% they beat expectations</text>
  <text start="226.019" dur="4.81">everything looks amazing guess what</text>
  <text start="228.579" dur="4.351">retail isn&amp;#39;t as bad as we thought it was</text>
  <text start="230.829" dur="4.351">it looks like everything&amp;#39;s improving at</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="4.169">this point well then you got to look</text>
  <text start="235.18" dur="4.07">closely what they did to do this and</text>
  <text start="237.099" dur="4.17">what&amp;#39;s very funny about this other</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="4.629">corporations have done this in the past</text>
  <text start="241.269" dur="4.351">to make their revenues look better make</text>
  <text start="243.879" dur="4.04">their sales look better where they</text>
  <text start="245.62" dur="5.789">closed factories laid off employees</text>
  <text start="247.919" dur="7.15">bought back their stock and this is</text>
  <text start="251.409" dur="5.88">exactly what Walmart did they spend 4.3</text>
  <text start="255.069" dur="5.04">billion in buybacks and dividends in the</text>
  <text start="257.289" dur="6.511">quarter and they created four billion in</text>
  <text start="260.109" dur="6.12">free cash flow and what&amp;#39;s even more</text>
  <text start="263.8" dur="6.06">interesting than that do you really</text>
  <text start="266.229" dur="5.701">think that people all of a sudden ran</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="6.54">out to walmart and started purchasing</text>
  <text start="271.93" dur="6.269">like crazy no of course not now we did</text>
  <text start="276.4" dur="4.5">come off of tax season maybe some people</text>
  <text start="278.199" dur="5.551">got revenues maybe we can give them that</text>
  <text start="280.9" dur="8.069">but when we look closely at this we see</text>
  <text start="283.75" dur="8.21">that food stamp dollars we&amp;#39;re used in</text>
  <text start="288.969" dur="5.551">walmart in the amount of 13 to 18</text>
  <text start="291.96" dur="4.9">billion dollars so</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="6.269">as the people are getting laid off</text>
  <text start="296.86" dur="7.35">they&amp;#39;re applying for food stamps they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.789" dur="8.91">going into a Walmart and purchasing food</text>
  <text start="304.21" dur="9.35">and from the buybacks by laying off by</text>
  <text start="309.699" dur="6.09">closing stores with food stamp money</text>
  <text start="313.56" dur="5.829">they were able to show that look</text>
  <text start="315.789" dur="6.03">everything is fine so is really</text>
  <text start="319.389" dur="3.99">everything fine no because you know</text>
  <text start="321.819" dur="3.901">what&amp;#39;s going to happen next month and</text>
  <text start="323.379" dur="4.231">the month after that all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="325.72" dur="3.81">unexpectedly like they they like to use</text>
  <text start="327.61" dur="2.88">sales are going to decline now of course</text>
  <text start="329.53" dur="2.46">they can&amp;#39;t blame it on the weather</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="3.39">because it&amp;#39;s spring it&amp;#39;s beautiful and</text>
  <text start="331.99" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s warm so they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="333.88" dur="5.819">able to do this and they&amp;#39;ll try to</text>
  <text start="337.03" dur="4.35">explain it way some other way but right</text>
  <text start="339.699" dur="5.071">now they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="341.38" dur="7.17">that retail sales there on the men</text>
  <text start="344.77" dur="6.09">everything is fine now caterpillar they</text>
  <text start="348.55" dur="4.769">came out well their sales are not doing</text>
  <text start="350.86" dur="6.029">well at all I mean if we think back to</text>
  <text start="353.319" dur="9.021">the Great Recession they had 19 months</text>
  <text start="356.889" dur="9.231">of the colliding sales 19 months from</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="9.069">2008 all the way up to the beginning of</text>
  <text start="366.12" dur="6.97">or the middle of 2010 right now during</text>
  <text start="371.409" dur="3">this incredible recovery that the</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="4.109">president continually tells us that</text>
  <text start="374.409" dur="4.73">we&amp;#39;re in that the Fed continually tells</text>
  <text start="377.199" dur="5.75">us that the economy is strong</text>
  <text start="379.139" dur="9.161">caterpillar has had 41 months of</text>
  <text start="382.949" dur="8.431">declining sales it is worse off it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.3" dur="7.709">almost it&amp;#39;s more than double what it was</text>
  <text start="391.38" dur="6.49">during the recession period so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.009" dur="3.63">break down where it&amp;#39;s going wrong</text>
  <text start="397.87" dur="3.87">because people say well it must be Latin</text>
  <text start="399.639" dur="4.741">America that&amp;#39;s where the problem is well</text>
  <text start="401.74" dur="4.32">no that&amp;#39;s not where the problem is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="4.319">one of the problems but it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="406.06" dur="5.63">entire problem when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="408.699" dur="7.47">see that North America sales are down</text>
  <text start="411.69" dur="7.15">eleven percent when we look at Asia</text>
  <text start="416.169" dur="6.24">Pacific we see sales are down ten</text>
  <text start="418.84" dur="7.71">percent yes Latin America that is the</text>
  <text start="422.409" dur="5.081">worst it is thirty-seven percent we see</text>
  <text start="426.55" dur="5.17">Europe</text>
  <text start="427.49" dur="5.579">Africa Middle East down six percent so</text>
  <text start="431.72" dur="5.099">when we look at this it&amp;#39;s not just one</text>
  <text start="433.069" dur="8.25">area it&amp;#39;s a combination of all the areas</text>
  <text start="436.819" dur="9.301">and there&amp;#39;s no sign of improvement</text>
  <text start="441.319" dur="8.961">whatsoever another sign another</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="7.41">indicator someone is lying once again</text>
  <text start="450.28" dur="5.74">because if this is a recovery I hate to</text>
  <text start="453.53" dur="4.859">see what the entire collapse is going to</text>
  <text start="456.02" dur="6.09">look like and it&amp;#39;s going to look</text>
  <text start="458.389" dur="8.101">horrific we see the philly fed remember</text>
  <text start="462.11" dur="7.739">we had that bounce in March well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.49" dur="7.23">gone too now we see that the philly fed</text>
  <text start="469.849" dur="6.841">it dropped to negative 1 point 6 and</text>
  <text start="473.72" dur="4.439">negative 1 point 8 in new orders so</text>
  <text start="476.69" dur="3.92">there they tumbled right back to</text>
  <text start="478.159" dur="7.111">contraction so we have this strange blip</text>
  <text start="480.61" dur="6.16">out of nowhere last month but it out of</text>
  <text start="485.27" dur="4.92">the eight of the nine we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="486.77" dur="6.709">contraction signaling recession</text>
  <text start="490.19" dur="6.029">recession recession recession and</text>
  <text start="493.479" dur="5.291">looking at caterpillar looking at the</text>
  <text start="496.219" dur="5.82">philly fed looking at retail this is a</text>
  <text start="498.77" dur="7.199">lot worse than a recession we are going</text>
  <text start="502.039" dur="5.581">through the collapse now of course no</text>
  <text start="505.969" dur="4.92">one&amp;#39;s going to admit to it especially</text>
  <text start="507.62" dur="5.729">the president and the government not the</text>
  <text start="510.889" dur="4.59">Fed because there had been telling us</text>
  <text start="513.349" dur="4.471">that everything is fine you imagine if</text>
  <text start="515.479" dur="6.381">they came out and all of a sudden said</text>
  <text start="517.82" dur="8.209">hey oh we&amp;#39;re in a recession right now</text>
  <text start="521.86" dur="6.64">you mean you lied to us all these years</text>
  <text start="526.029" dur="6.161">no they have to keep the illusion alive</text>
  <text start="528.5" dur="7.26">they just can&amp;#39;t admit to that and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.19" dur="5.16">seeing more and more investors flee the</text>
  <text start="535.76" dur="3.21">stock market I mean bank of america is</text>

  <text start="627.41" dur="4.98">convince the American people that</text>
  <text start="628.7" dur="6.24">everything is fine now we know what the</text>
  <text start="632.39" dur="4.35">central bankers are planning their</text>
  <text start="634.94" dur="4.86">planning to go into each one of the</text>
  <text start="636.74" dur="4.47">countries and push debt out further and</text>
  <text start="639.8" dur="4.71">further because this is how their system</text>
  <text start="641.21" dur="6.18">operates they need to push debt if they</text>
  <text start="644.51" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t push debt their system comes to an</text>
  <text start="647.39" dur="3.42">end and this is why they&amp;#39;re going into</text>
  <text start="649.31" dur="3.15">many different countries and having</text>
  <text start="650.81" dur="3">regime change because they need to set</text>
  <text start="652.46" dur="3.42">up a central bank in there they need get</text>
  <text start="653.81" dur="3.93">full control and they need to capture</text>
  <text start="655.88" dur="5.31">the oil market put the dollar on the oil</text>
  <text start="657.74" dur="5.67">and keep the system operating and this</text>
  <text start="661.19" dur="4.01">was the deal with the RAM because what</text>
  <text start="663.41" dur="7.07">we&amp;#39;re hearing right now from the IMF</text>
  <text start="665.2" dur="9.15">their warning Iran not to count on oil</text>
  <text start="670.48" dur="7.3">for their revenue to boost their economy</text>
  <text start="674.35" dur="5.62">they should seek other opportunities but</text>
  <text start="677.78" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t depend on oil and don&amp;#39;t sell oil</text>
  <text start="679.97" dur="4.77">right now very interesting because</text>
  <text start="682.01" dur="5.52">remember what Iran did they said they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="684.74" dur="4.65">going to sell oil not using the dollar</text>
  <text start="687.53" dur="3.89">the IMF which is controlled by the</text>

  <text start="713.269" dur="5.13">need to come in line with the IMF so</text>
  <text start="716.239" dur="7.76">they can reconnect them to the global</text>
  <text start="718.399" dur="9.96">economy this was the whole entire deal</text>
  <text start="723.999" dur="7.15">the entire deal was not nuclear the</text>
  <text start="728.359" dur="5.85">entire deal was to get into the banking</text>
