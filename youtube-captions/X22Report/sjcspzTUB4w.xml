  <text start="143.2" dur="7.18">having money outside of their system</text>

  <text start="150.38" dur="7.68">on the stock market in the meantime</text>
  <text start="154.36" dur="7.92">things are falling apart and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.06" dur="8.399">falling apart rapidly we see Freddie Mac</text>
  <text start="162.28" dur="5.799">well Freddie just issued a warning now</text>
  <text start="166.459" dur="3.181">why would they issue a warning right now</text>
  <text start="168.079" dur="6.091">the real estate markets fantastic isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="169.64" dur="7.14">it and what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the</text>
  <text start="174.17" dur="5.88">real estate market and reef eyes well</text>
  <text start="176.78" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re about to get worse the</text>
  <text start="180.05" dur="4.32">population of</text>
  <text start="181.37" dur="5.28">refinance candidates has already plunged</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="6.6">by more than half and as Black Knight</text>
  <text start="186.65" dur="6.24">pointed out at the end of november they</text>
  <text start="190.97" dur="3.39">were still two million borrowers who</text>
  <text start="192.89" dur="4.23">could save about 200 a month by</text>
  <text start="194.36" dur="5.25">refinancing a cumulative 1 billion a</text>
  <text start="197.12" dur="4.88">month in potential savings this is less</text>
  <text start="199.61" dur="6.36">than half of the 2.1 billion a month</text>
  <text start="202" dur="7.09">available just four weeks ago since then</text>
  <text start="205.97" dur="8.07">the number has shrunk substantially as</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="7.289">rate continually move up Freddie their</text>
  <text start="214.04" dur="4.83">explicit warning says that if rates</text>
  <text start="216.379" dur="4.681">continue their upward trend expect</text>
  <text start="218.87" dur="7.429">mortgage activity to be significantly</text>
  <text start="221.06" dur="10.23">subdued in 2017 what are they saying</text>
  <text start="226.299" dur="7.66">real estate is going to slow its going</text>
  <text start="231.29" dur="6.36">to decline and if you don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="233.959" dur="8.101">buyers what happens to the prices they</text>
  <text start="237.65" dur="7.86">start falling rapidly unless they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="242.06" dur="5.94">continually manipulated by the Fed but</text>
  <text start="245.51" dur="5.129">they can&amp;#39;t manipulate everything this is</text>
  <text start="248" dur="5.7">why we see the 20 cities that they can</text>
  <text start="250.639" dur="6.09">manipulate and everything outside of</text>
  <text start="253.7" dur="5.849">that prices are coming down I just</text>
  <text start="256.729" dur="8.551">trekked across the country they are</text>
  <text start="259.549" dur="11.43">dropping quite a bit there&amp;#39;s no traffic</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="9.96">to these homes now as the dow is soaring</text>
  <text start="270.979" dur="9.421">to all-time new highs home builder</text>
  <text start="275.24" dur="7.08">confidence surges now this is kind of</text>
  <text start="280.4" dur="4.29">strange because interest rates are going</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="4.92">up mortgage applications they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="5.49">continually declining Freddie matches</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="6.06">put out a warning and home builder</text>
  <text start="290.18" dur="7.2">confidence explodes to its highest since</text>
  <text start="293.3" dur="7.41">2005 of course we know what happened in</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="6.15">two thousand seven and eight real estate</text>
  <text start="300.71" dur="6.2">collapsed well that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="303.53" dur="6.81">happen now remember most of this stuff</text>
  <text start="306.91" dur="6.73">that the corporate media is putting out</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="4.44">there about confidence levels and things</text>
  <text start="313.64" dur="4.53">like that</text>
  <text start="314.78" dur="8.73">it&amp;#39;s completely made up take for example</text>
  <text start="318.17" dur="8.28">us manufacturing PMI the survey well us</text>
  <text start="323.51" dur="5.4">manage us manufacturing PMI they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.45" dur="6.18">telling us that hit new time wholetime</text>
  <text start="328.91" dur="6.12">new highs it&amp;#39;s doing fantastic but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.63" dur="7.44">entirely decoupled from industrial</text>
  <text start="335.03" dur="8.34">production and export sales well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="340.07" dur="7.68">completely stagnated so what do you</text>
  <text start="343.37" dur="7.26">believe the soft survey data or hard</text>
  <text start="347.75" dur="7.56">real data I&amp;#39;m going to go with the whore</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="6.63">real data I&amp;#39;m going to say ok the survey</text>
  <text start="355.31" dur="4.68">was completely manipulated to make</text>
  <text start="357.26" dur="6.03">things look good just like hmm the</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="7.2">unemployment just like GDP just like the</text>
  <text start="363.29" dur="6.689">stock market you start to see a common</text>
  <text start="367.19" dur="5.4">thread through all of this where the</text>
  <text start="369.979" dur="5.551">central bank the US government wherever</text>
  <text start="372.59" dur="8.22">they can manipulate they do it but the</text>
  <text start="375.53" dur="7.38">hard facts contradict everything that</text>
  <text start="380.81" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re manipulating which is kind of</text>
  <text start="382.91" dur="8.52">strange even the Philly and the Empire</text>
  <text start="386.96" dur="8.25">fed surveys well they surged once again</text>
  <text start="391.43" dur="8.19">now we&amp;#39;ve seen this before if we go back</text>
  <text start="395.21" dur="10.38">in time we&amp;#39;ve seen the Philly and the</text>
  <text start="399.62" dur="11.79">Empire fed they surged right before the</text>
  <text start="405.59" dur="8.4">collapse in 2008 they want everyone to</text>
  <text start="411.41" dur="5.19">believe that everything is doing fine</text>
  <text start="413.99" dur="3.75">and when you look at the Empire fed in</text>
  <text start="416.6" dur="5.28">the philly fed labor market conditions</text>
  <text start="417.74" dur="6">they remain weak Manufacturing&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="5.01">reporting declines in employment and</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="10.32">hours worked inventories continue to</text>
  <text start="426.89" dur="10.92">fall so we have some problems here the</text>
  <text start="434.06" dur="5.609">data is not matching up and you know you</text>
  <text start="437.81" dur="4.02">hear the government out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="439.669" dur="4.441">saying that you know tax receipts are at</text>
  <text start="441.83" dur="4.53">all-time new highs but you need to break</text>
  <text start="444.11" dur="4.459">this down because they&amp;#39;re telling us the</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="4.97">revenue coming in remember</text>
  <text start="448.569" dur="6.12">they enacted to laws FATCA and gatka</text>
  <text start="451.33" dur="5.729">where they go across the globe and they</text>
  <text start="454.689" dur="6">tax those people who were never taxed</text>
  <text start="457.059" dur="7.051">before who have funds in other countries</text>
  <text start="460.689" dur="5.551">but when you look at the real revenue</text>
  <text start="464.11" dur="6.239">coming in from the workforce here in the</text>
  <text start="466.24" dur="7.169">United States it has been declining not</text>
  <text start="470.349" dur="6.511">increasing and we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve discussed</text>
  <text start="473.409" dur="6.331">that in earlier reports even when we go</text>
  <text start="476.86" dur="7.41">from state to state we also see those</text>
  <text start="479.74" dur="8.609">revenues decline so it&amp;#39;s a play on words</text>
  <text start="484.27" dur="6.269">and what they do here and it sounds</text>
  <text start="488.349" dur="4.35">great until you we through all the data</text>
  <text start="490.539" dur="5.67">and you say wait a minute I see what</text>
  <text start="492.699" dur="5.01">they just did since those two laws they</text>
  <text start="496.209" dur="3.151">went around the globe and they included</text>
  <text start="497.709" dur="4.17">all that and saying wow look at this</text>
  <text start="499.36" dur="3.779">everyone&amp;#39;s working but if you remove</text>
  <text start="501.879" dur="3.51">those individuals and you look at the</text>
  <text start="503.139" dur="6.87">people who are actually working and what</text>
  <text start="505.389" dur="7.231">they&amp;#39;re contributing guess what it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="510.009" dur="7.82">the revenues aren&amp;#39;t there it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="512.62" dur="7.769">working how can it be think about it if</text>
  <text start="517.829" dur="4.721">people are losing their full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="520.389" dur="7.411">people are falling off the job market</text>
  <text start="522.55" dur="8.19">people are getting part-time jobs people</text>
  <text start="527.8" dur="8.37">are making less money wages and salaries</text>
  <text start="530.74" dur="6.57">are going down that means less taxes so</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="2.789">what the government is trying to</text>
  <text start="537.31" dur="4.74">convince us of and what the central bank</text>
  <text start="538.959" dur="6.5">is trying to convince us of it makes no</text>
  <text start="542.05" dur="8.789">sense now something very interesting</text>
  <text start="545.459" dur="8.74">happened the Fed came out and it said</text>
  <text start="550.839" dur="7.56">the largest UX US banks will have to pay</text>
  <text start="554.199" dur="8.12">as much as 2 billion more a year to</text>
  <text start="558.399" dur="7.581">ensure against a future market collapse</text>
  <text start="562.319" dur="8.231">now that&amp;#39;s very interesting in itself a</text>
  <text start="565.98" dur="9.31">future market collapse they need more</text>
  <text start="570.55" dur="7.07">funds they outlined a new rule designed</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="5.01">to further protect the financial system</text>
  <text start="577.62" dur="5.59">do you really think it&amp;#39;s protecting the</text>
  <text start="580.3" dur="8.25">financial system now</text>
  <text start="583.21" dur="8.02">this system is planned to come down and</text>
  <text start="588.55" dur="5.83">what they&amp;#39;re saying here is the rules</text>
  <text start="591.23" dur="4.86">demand Wall Street holds more debt that</text>
  <text start="594.38" dur="6.68">could be converted to shareholder equity</text>
  <text start="596.09" dur="7.77">if a bank is pushed into bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="601.06" dur="6.63">investor owned stock is the main buffer</text>
  <text start="603.86" dur="9.33">against failure then they move to</text>
  <text start="607.69" dur="7.08">depositors they do the ballons you see</text>
  <text start="613.19" dur="3.51">how this is playing out here and</text>
  <text start="614.77" dur="4.33">something else that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="616.7" dur="6.18">is that the Fed officials they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="619.1" dur="9.96">declined to identify the four banks that</text>
  <text start="622.88" dur="7.47">lack sufficient debt under tLAC so this</text>
  <text start="629.06" dur="5.49">is very interesting that they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="630.35" dur="6.42">to identify or reveal these institutions</text>
  <text start="634.55" dur="4.59">now we know many of these banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="636.77" dur="5.28">insolvent many of these banks were as we</text>
  <text start="639.14" dur="6.42">know do not have cash on hand and we</text>
  <text start="642.05" dur="5.94">know the stress tests it&amp;#39;s a propaganda</text>
  <text start="645.56" dur="4.14">piece to make everyone feel good that</text>
  <text start="647.99" dur="5.07">the banks are doing well they put this</text>
  <text start="649.7" dur="6.27">into place after 2008 to make everyone</text>
  <text start="653.06" dur="4.95">think that look we&amp;#39;re doing these hard</text>
  <text start="655.97" dur="5.25">tests to make sure that these banks are</text>
  <text start="658.01" dur="7.11">okay we know that&amp;#39;s fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="661.22" dur="7.32">and what is happening here is their</text>
  <text start="665.12" dur="5.61">propping up the banking system they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="668.54" dur="5.52">not protecting the people they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="670.73" dur="7.17">depict protecting anything else except</text>
  <text start="674.06" dur="6.24">themselves we see the war on cash is</text>
  <text start="677.9" dur="3.69">escalating we know that Australia is</text>

  <text start="753.529" dur="3.391">up the banks and when we look at</text>
  <text start="755.3" dur="5.31">different countries we see that</text>
  <text start="756.92" dur="8.94">Australia the populated the popularity</text>

  <text start="782.269" dur="7.951">credit cards or around 20 and we can see</text>
  <text start="786.889" dur="6.18">right now that they are trying to get</text>

  <text start="793.069" dur="9.75">using debit and credit and we know this</text>
  <text start="798.62" dur="7.56">is part of their plan they want the cash</text>
  <text start="802.819" dur="7.89">inside of the bank&amp;#39;s makes it much</text>
