  <text start="156.25" dur="9.18">that are looking for jobs think about</text>
  <text start="159.58" dur="10.14">this the US economy depends on retail we</text>
  <text start="165.43" dur="7.38">lost manufacturing GDP 70% of it is made</text>
  <text start="169.72" dur="6.42">up of people spending money in retail</text>
  <text start="172.81" dur="7.5">now we know online sales is only 10% of</text>
  <text start="176.14" dur="7.679">retail and if we go back to 2008 we saw</text>
  <text start="180.31" dur="5.759">that there was a record 6,000 163 retail</text>
  <text start="183.819" dur="3.481">stores that were closed down at that</text>
  <text start="186.069" dur="3.091">time because we</text>
  <text start="187.3" dur="4.17">were going through a major recession</text>
  <text start="189.16" dur="3.93">which we really never recovered from but</text>
  <text start="191.47" dur="3.45">what they did was they convinced us that</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="4.08">we recovered they&amp;#39;re very good at this</text>
  <text start="194.92" dur="3.51">the central banking system they know how</text>
  <text start="197.17" dur="3.03">to play with the numbers they know how</text>
  <text start="198.43" dur="3.72">to play with the economy to make it look</text>
  <text start="200.2" dur="6.6">like everything is fantastic think about</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="6.18">it go back to 1929 no one knew that the</text>
  <text start="206.8" dur="2.25">economy was a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="208.33" dur="5.55">disaster</text>
  <text start="209.05" dur="9">fast forward to 2007-2008 people thought</text>
  <text start="213.88" dur="7.29">everything was great until it wasn&amp;#39;t so</text>
  <text start="218.05" dur="4.26">so far in 2017 there&amp;#39;s between seven and</text>
  <text start="221.17" dur="4.8">eight thousand stores that have been</text>
  <text start="222.31" dur="7.29">shut down and we still have two more</text>
  <text start="225.97" dur="4.74">months to go so right now we can see</text>
  <text start="229.6" dur="4.17">that 2017</text>
  <text start="230.71" dur="5.22">is going to be the year where we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="233.77" dur="4.59">the most store closings now we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.93" dur="4.8">even gone into this holiday season and</text>
  <text start="238.36" dur="3.78">once this holiday season is a disaster</text>
  <text start="240.73" dur="2.46">of course the corporate median</text>
  <text start="242.14" dur="4.17">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna make it seem like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.19" dur="6.98">really good it&amp;#39;s going to be even worse</text>
  <text start="246.31" dur="6.69">now think about this once again we have</text>
  <text start="250.17" dur="5.8">300 retailers that have declared</text>
  <text start="253" dur="6.09">bankruptcy so far in 2017 and we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="4.86">pace to lose over 147 million square</text>
  <text start="259.09" dur="4.65">feet of retail space by the end of the</text>
  <text start="260.83" dur="4.77">year but what they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us</text>
  <text start="263.74" dur="3.72">is that we just can&amp;#39;t find people to</text>
  <text start="265.6" dur="3.51">work and we have all these jobs that are</text>
  <text start="267.46" dur="5.42">just open and ready for people to come</text>
  <text start="269.11" dur="7.02">in now let&amp;#39;s look at corporations their</text>
  <text start="272.88" dur="5.14">revenue their sales have been declining</text>
  <text start="276.13" dur="5.25">forget about their earnings that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.02" dur="5.1">manipulated revenue and sales have been</text>
  <text start="281.38" dur="4.05">declining do you really think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.12" dur="5.31">hiring we also talked about how</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="5.31">corporations out in California are</text>
  <text start="288.43" dur="4.02">buying office buildings but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="290.74" dur="4.11">nobody in them actually there I have no</text>
  <text start="292.45" dur="6.09">plans to fill the office buildings with</text>
  <text start="294.85" dur="6.15">anyone they&amp;#39;re completely empty they</text>
  <text start="298.54" dur="5.73">thought the economy was gonna boom the</text>
  <text start="301" dur="6.45">economy is not booming the whole thing</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="7.55">is falling apart but they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="307.45" dur="7.41">anyone to know about this so this whole</text>
  <text start="311.82" dur="4.87">jolts number of there&amp;#39;s so many job</text>
  <text start="314.86" dur="3.57">openings out there yes</text>
  <text start="316.69" dur="4.2">there could be job openings because what</text>
  <text start="318.43" dur="2.67">corporations do and if you ever worked</text>
  <text start="320.89" dur="1.8">in</text>
  <text start="321.1" dur="3.57">corporation they have these job wrecks</text>
  <text start="322.69" dur="7.13">where they keep them open in each</text>
  <text start="324.67" dur="7.74">department and they interview people and</text>
  <text start="329.82" dur="4.87">they keep them open they want to close</text>
  <text start="332.41" dur="3.96">them because if they close them and they</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="4.32">say they don&amp;#39;t need them they lose them</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="5.37">very hard to get back now the</text>
  <text start="339.01" dur="6.24">corporation might say listen and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="5.97">seen this before prior to 2008 we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="3.96">a hiring freeze but you can still</text>
  <text start="347.71" dur="3.09">interview people but we&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="3.81">hiring people but em we&amp;#39;re gonna say</text>
  <text start="350.8" dur="3.96">these positions are open this is what</text>
  <text start="353.02" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and the same</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="5.52">thing happened leading up to the</text>
  <text start="356.98" dur="6.66">recession of 2008 we also see you as</text>
  <text start="360.28" dur="7.11">consumers right now they are in a huge</text>
  <text start="363.64" dur="6.96">amount of debt us credit card debt has</text>
  <text start="367.39" dur="5.1">risen above 1 trillion with student</text>
  <text start="370.6" dur="5.25">loans auto loans they&amp;#39;re hitting</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="6.93">all-time highs now this is a complete</text>
  <text start="375.85" dur="8.1">disaster because we are we&amp;#39;re at that</text>
  <text start="379.42" dur="9">point where we were back in 2007 going</text>
  <text start="383.95" dur="6.17">into 2008 and we know right after that</text>
  <text start="388.42" dur="5.31">everything fell apart</text>
  <text start="390.12" dur="7.9">so this non revolving credit reached a</text>
  <text start="393.73" dur="7.29">fresh record of 2.7 8 trillion revolving</text>
  <text start="398.02" dur="5.37">or credit card debt is now back over 8</text>
  <text start="401.02" dur="5.34">trillion dollars or one point zero zero</text>
  <text start="403.39" dur="5.25">six trillion to be precise and fast</text>
  <text start="406.36" dur="7.23">approaching the old time bubble high of</text>
  <text start="408.64" dur="9.54">one point zero two trillion which was</text>
  <text start="413.59" dur="5.97">hit in the summer of 2008 and speaking</text>
  <text start="418.18" dur="3.57">of student loan in auto loans</text>
  <text start="419.56" dur="4.17">the feds latest data showed that in the</text>
  <text start="421.75" dur="5.88">third quarter these rose to all-time</text>
  <text start="423.73" dur="8.12">high of 1.1 1/2 trillion for auto loans</text>
  <text start="427.63" dur="6.63">and we are exactly back where we were</text>
  <text start="431.85" dur="4.87">during the recession now why are people</text>
  <text start="434.26" dur="5.34">using credit cards today because when</text>
  <text start="436.72" dur="6.06">people lose their jobs when people have</text>
  <text start="439.6" dur="5.43">no money they need to survive on credit</text>
  <text start="442.78" dur="4.29">even when people have jobs than they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.03" dur="5.58">not getting cost of living they still</text>
  <text start="447.07" dur="5.97">have to survive on credit if people have</text>
  <text start="450.61" dur="4.35">part-time jobs they need to survive on</text>
  <text start="453.04" dur="5.64">credit and I don&amp;#39;t mean going out</text>
  <text start="454.96" dur="5.549">in TVs washers dryers stereos things</text>
  <text start="458.68" dur="3.93">like that because if that was true</text>
  <text start="460.509" dur="4.051">retail would be booming right now what</text>
  <text start="462.61" dur="4.61">people are buying they&amp;#39;re buying food</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re trying to get by with rent</text>
  <text start="467.22" dur="5.289">they&amp;#39;re trying to get by with their car</text>
  <text start="469.81" dur="5.579">payment this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="472.509" dur="6.511">now and remember the central bank pushes</text>
  <text start="475.389" dur="6.511">their entire scheme by pushing out more</text>
  <text start="479.02" dur="4.799">debt and this is why we see the savings</text>
  <text start="481.9" dur="3.48">rate continually dropping people are</text>
  <text start="483.819" dur="3.121">using their savings because they have to</text>
  <text start="485.38" dur="4.56">do what they have to pay off their</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="5.49">credit cards and they pay off a little</text>
  <text start="489.94" dur="4.05">bit so they can you know spend two three</text>
  <text start="492.43" dur="5.16">hundred dollars during that month and</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="6.63">maybe pay off twenty twenty five thirty</text>
  <text start="497.59" dur="4.38">of that credit card and it all depends</text>
  <text start="500.62" dur="2.4">on the credit card and payments and</text>
  <text start="501.97" dur="3.78">things like that but this is what people</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="6.66">have been doing and it&amp;#39;s very very tough</text>
  <text start="505.75" dur="6.69">now we see the yield curve now the yield</text>
  <text start="509.68" dur="5.19">curve is collapsing and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="4.8">happen before when the Fed races the Fed</text>
  <text start="514.87" dur="3.779">fund rate and they&amp;#39;ve done it a lot</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="3.299">faster in the past and the yield curve</text>
  <text start="518.649" dur="3.421">just completely crashes they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="520.539" dur="2.971">very very slow right now because they</text>
  <text start="522.07" dur="3.93">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen if they</text>
  <text start="523.51" dur="4.139">continually push it up very high the</text>
  <text start="526" dur="2.85">entire thing is going to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="527.649" dur="2.791">this is why people have been mentioned</text>
  <text start="528.85" dur="3.239">in the yield curve because everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="6.66">starting to realize we have major</text>
  <text start="532.089" dur="7.651">problems here now as we know the economy</text>
  <text start="537.1" dur="5.04">is deteriorating very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="4.11">this holiday season is not going to be</text>
  <text start="542.14" dur="3.09">any better we&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="543.85" dur="3.96">housing market implode remember this</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="5.22">summer the housing market it was</text>
  <text start="547.81" dur="3.06">absolutely awful and during the summer</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="3.24">months</text>
  <text start="550.87" dur="4.89">housing usually does very very well this</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="5.1">time around not so much</text>
  <text start="555.76" dur="6">last summer not so much and going into</text>
  <text start="558.79" dur="5.46">this year 2018 it&amp;#39;s going to be even</text>
  <text start="561.76" dur="5.46">worse because we&amp;#39;re on the downside of</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="5.13">these gigantic bubbles the people out</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="3.42">there just don&amp;#39;t have the funds this is</text>
  <text start="569.38" dur="3.51">why builders are coming up with all</text>
  <text start="570.64" dur="4.77">these different type of plans when you</text>
  <text start="572.89" dur="4.259">see builders or the Fed or the</text>
  <text start="575.41" dur="4.11">government come up with types of plans</text>
  <text start="577.149" dur="3.93">of trying to help people which they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="579.52" dur="5.04">really not trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="581.079" dur="4.891">to get people to take out more loans you</text>
  <text start="584.56" dur="2.61">know we&amp;#39;re in trouble when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="585.97" dur="1.93">telling you hey listen if you buy a</text>
  <text start="587.17" dur="1.72">house</text>
  <text start="587.9" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;ll help you pay off some of your</text>
  <text start="588.89" dur="5.52">student loans you know were in trouble</text>
  <text start="591.65" dur="5.82">if they&amp;#39;re lowing the credit standards</text>
  <text start="594.41" dur="5.58">and going to the sub subprime for auto</text>
  <text start="597.47" dur="4.53">loans you know we are in trouble if</text>
  <text start="599.99" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re just trying to get anyone to</text>
  <text start="602" dur="4.71">take a student loan out you know we are</text>
  <text start="604.43" dur="4.62">in trouble and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="606.71" dur="4.47">seeing for quite a while now the central</text>
  <text start="609.05" dur="4.47">bankers they understood and they still</text>
  <text start="611.18" dur="4.53">understand that the system was coming</text>
  <text start="613.52" dur="5.01">down and I&amp;#39;m not talking about the Fed</text>
  <text start="615.71" dur="5.7">they knew this the ECB they know this</text>
  <text start="618.53" dur="5.82">the biz they know this IMF they know</text>
  <text start="621.41" dur="4.98">this and they made plans the central</text>
  <text start="624.35" dur="5.25">bankers they&amp;#39;re controlling the world</text>
  <text start="626.39" dur="5.52">right now because they hold all they</text>
  <text start="629.6" dur="6.66">hold the key to each country because</text>
  <text start="631.91" dur="6.36">they supply them with currency they</text>
  <text start="636.26" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t care about the laws they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="638.27" dur="4.8">care about that they just care about</text>
  <text start="640.61" dur="3.54">supplying the currency to the</text>
  <text start="643.07" dur="2.97">governments because once you put a</text>
  <text start="644.15" dur="4.62">government into debt you control them</text>
  <text start="646.04" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s that simple and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="648.77" dur="4.98">right now is they&amp;#39;ve been making plans</text>
  <text start="651.92" dur="4.89">and they&amp;#39;ve been pushing their plans for</text>
  <text start="653.75" dur="4.77">quite a while to shift everything and</text>
  <text start="656.81" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s going to be shifted away from the</text>
  <text start="658.52" dur="4.95">dollar what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a huge D</text>
  <text start="661.76" dur="3.09">dollarization right now and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="663.47" dur="3.57">unfolding right in front of our eyes</text>
  <text start="664.85" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s been unfolding for a quite a while</text>
  <text start="667.04" dur="4.89">but central bank&amp;#39;s what they do is they</text>
  <text start="669.68" dur="4.86">do this very slowly very methodically so</text>

  <text start="763.91" dur="4.17">joining the one belt one road system</text>
  <text start="765.589" dur="4.591">just like we&amp;#39;ve discussed many many</text>
  <text start="768.08" dur="6.27">times before many other countries are</text>
  <text start="770.18" dur="7.62">joining this this whole thing is being</text>
  <text start="774.35" dur="5.91">created and built right now because the</text>
  <text start="777.8" dur="5.52">central bankers know and they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="780.26" dur="5.79">any allegiance to any country a group</text>
  <text start="783.32" dur="4.53">they don&amp;#39;t care what they care about is</text>
  <text start="786.05" dur="2.88">okay we have this dying system we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="787.85" dur="3.03">want to be blamed for it because we want</text>
  <text start="788.93" dur="4.35">to start this new system someplace else</text>
  <text start="790.88" dur="5.73">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and</text>
  <text start="793.28" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;ve been mapping this for many many</text>
  <text start="796.61" dur="3.74">years and it&amp;#39;s been very slow very</text>
  <text start="798.35" dur="5.52">methodical and they&amp;#39;ve been doing this</text>
  <text start="800.35" dur="7.39">very very carefully so people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="803.87" dur="5.7">realize it and the deal like in during</text>
  <text start="807.74" dur="3.84">World War Two before World War two was</text>
  <text start="809.57" dur="4.55">made that the u.s. would become the</text>
  <text start="811.58" dur="5.48">reserve currency after the war and</text>
  <text start="814.12" dur="5.35">they&amp;#39;re doing it once again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="817.06" dur="3.88">making preparations they moved</text>
  <text start="819.47" dur="4.08">everything from the west to the east and</text>
  <text start="820.94" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this and many people</text>
  <text start="823.55" dur="5.76">have not picked up on this and we can</text>
  <text start="826.01" dur="5.579">see right now that many countries are de</text>
  <text start="829.31" dur="5.06">dólar rising right now because they</text>
  <text start="831.589" dur="5.701">realize that this is the time to do it</text>
  <text start="834.37" dur="4.99">the you see more countries do it because</text>
  <text start="837.29" dur="5.52">they understand the dollar is dead and</text>
  <text start="839.36" dur="6.81">there&amp;#39;s no place to go except maybe for</text>
  <text start="842.81" dur="5.37">maybe towards the you wan the SDF to</text>
  <text start="846.17" dur="3.87">cryptocurrency and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="848.18" dur="4.23">see how this plays out because we do</text>
  <text start="850.04" dur="3.69">have many factors all happening at once</text>
  <text start="852.41" dur="2.27">but we know what the central bankers</text>
  <text start="853.73" dur="3.589">want they</text>
  <text start="854.68" dur="5.25">control of the creation of currency</text>
  <text start="857.319" dur="4.591">because that&amp;#39;s all they have if you take</text>
  <text start="859.93" dur="4.949">that away from them you don&amp;#39;t need them</text>
  <text start="861.91" dur="5.19">they have no power whatsoever because</text>
  <text start="864.879" dur="5.101">then they can&amp;#39;t put countries into debt</text>
  <text start="867.1" dur="7.579">they can&amp;#39;t enslave the people so what</text>
  <text start="869.98" dur="9.389">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a slow grind</text>
  <text start="874.679" dur="7.9">to a collapse and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="879.369" dur="6.421">accelerate once they&amp;#39;re ready to pull</text>
  <text start="882.579" dur="6.091">the plug and the dollar is gonna go down</text>
  <text start="885.79" dur="5.099">fast the system is gonna go down fast</text>
  <text start="888.67" dur="3.539">but they like to cover this up with some</text>
  <text start="890.889" dur="2.61">type of an event and this is what</text>
  <text start="892.209" dur="2.88">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to plan this is why</text>
  <text start="893.499" dur="2.4">they&amp;#39;ve been holding off because they</text>
  <text start="895.089" dur="2.09">just don&amp;#39;t want to do it because</text>

  <text start="913.99" dur="6.75">this to happen and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="916.929" dur="5.7">holding off switching everyone over</text>
  <text start="920.74" dur="5.55">because they&amp;#39;re waiting for something to</text>

  <text start="927.279" dur="4.68">collapse hasn&amp;#39;t happened as of yet</text>
