  <text start="131.739" dur="6.03">everything leading up to the next</text>

  <text start="137.769" dur="6">controlled the economic narrative but</text>
  <text start="142.569" dur="5.791">he&amp;#39;s going to be pushing this to the</text>
  <text start="143.769" dur="7.351">next level he&amp;#39;s going to show that he is</text>
  <text start="148.36" dur="6.29">in complete and utter control yes I know</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="7.71">the market came down today but this is</text>

  <text start="158.83" dur="3.72">this to his advantage we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="160.54" dur="3.57">discussing that in a little bit but</text>
  <text start="162.55" dur="2.4">first we know we&amp;#39;re heading towards this</text>
  <text start="164.11" dur="3.33">transition</text>
  <text start="164.95" dur="5.28">we know the Federal Reserve it is being</text>
  <text start="167.44" dur="4.799">controlled by the Patriots we understand</text>
  <text start="170.23" dur="5.88">that we&amp;#39;re going to be moving out of a</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="6.031">central bank system and to prepare the</text>
  <text start="176.11" dur="5.64">American people for all of this what</text>
  <text start="178.27" dur="8.01">does Trump need to do he needs to get</text>
  <text start="181.75" dur="7.95">everyone off of the government&amp;#39;s welfare</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="4.739">system or most of them as many people as</text>
  <text start="189.7" dur="4.68">he possibly can</text>
  <text start="191.019" dur="5.731">why he cannot have people dependent on</text>
  <text start="194.38" dur="5.7">the government remember over the many</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="5.34">many years this was the entire plan if</text>
  <text start="200.08" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;re dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="202.09" dur="4.56">you are controlled if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="5.1">dependent on the government guess what</text>
  <text start="206.65" dur="5.49">you can survive on your own plus going</text>
  <text start="209.44" dur="5.66">through this transition the government</text>
  <text start="212.14" dur="4.71">will not be able to help the people</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="4.359">they&amp;#39;ll be going through their own</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="6.919">transition until everything is ironed</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="8.791">out we&amp;#39;re going to be in a very bumpy</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="6.671">situation Trump knows this plus he needs</text>
  <text start="228.25" dur="5.579">to cut down on the expensive for all</text>
  <text start="230.44" dur="5.639">these entitlement programs and he&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="233.829" dur="4.491">the beginning stages of doing a lot of</text>
  <text start="236.079" dur="5.551">this now the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="238.32" dur="5.08">they&amp;#39;re looking into altering how it</text>
  <text start="241.63" dur="4.5">determines the national poverty level</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="5.97">which may put some Americans at risk of</text>
  <text start="246.13" dur="5.1">losing access to welfare programs the</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="4.47">measure is calculated at three times the</text>
  <text start="251.23" dur="5.49">cost of minimum food diet adjusted every</text>
  <text start="253.84" dur="5.519">year as prices rise it was first set in</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="4.17">the 60s and in 2018 a family for making</text>
  <text start="259.359" dur="3.991">no more than twenty five thousand nine</text>
  <text start="260.89" dur="4.68">hundred was considered under the poverty</text>
  <text start="263.35" dur="4.71">level this figure determines eligibility</text>
  <text start="265.57" dur="6.51">for federal state nonprofit programs</text>
  <text start="268.06" dur="7.47">like Medicaid and food stamps now the</text>
  <text start="272.08" dur="5.459">change is being reported as an effort by</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="4.22">the Trump administration to make it more</text>
  <text start="277.539" dur="5.25">difficult to access welfare programs</text>
  <text start="279.75" dur="5.86">remember the amount of debt the</text>
  <text start="282.789" dur="4.561">government has the amount of tax</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="5.4">receipts coming into the government and</text>
  <text start="287.35" dur="7.08">the amount of interest on this debt we</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="7.11">know the entire system is unsustainable</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="4.27">this can can&amp;#39;t continue moving forward</text>
  <text start="298.12" dur="3.28">this is why</text>
  <text start="298.7" dur="6.87">Trump the Patriots are pushing the</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="7.11">agenda very very hard to basically run</text>
  <text start="305.57" dur="6.42">the entire system into the ground and at</text>
  <text start="308.51" dur="6.42">the same time use all this free money to</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="5.4">build America back up now if we go back</text>
  <text start="314.93" dur="4.86">in time we know there were certain</text>
  <text start="317.39" dur="5.46">individuals that wanted everyone</text>
  <text start="319.79" dur="4.83">dependent on the government plus it was</text>
  <text start="322.85" dur="5.49">easy to make these people vote a certain</text>
  <text start="324.62" dur="6.06">way and they had complete and utter</text>
  <text start="328.34" dur="4.49">control these people especially if you</text>
  <text start="330.68" dur="5.82">had a control over their insurance</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="5.74">control over their welfare control over</text>
  <text start="336.5" dur="4.38">the food they eat control over</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="5.54">everything you completely control the</text>
  <text start="340.88" dur="5.49">people now the opposite is happening</text>
  <text start="344.11" dur="4.87">Trump said back in December</text>
  <text start="346.37" dur="4.71">millions of able-bodied working-age</text>
  <text start="348.98" dur="4.47">adults continued to collect food stamps</text>
  <text start="351.08" dur="4.98">without working or even looking for work</text>
  <text start="353.45" dur="6.03">our goal is to move these Americans from</text>
  <text start="356.06" dur="7.2">dependence to independence and into a</text>
  <text start="359.48" dur="7.08">good paying job and rewarding career yes</text>
  <text start="363.26" dur="6.6">the government was not originally set up</text>
  <text start="366.56" dur="5.99">by the founding fathers to help every</text>
  <text start="369.86" dur="6.96">single American person the government</text>
  <text start="372.55" dur="7.48">was set up to administer everything for</text>
  <text start="376.82" dur="6.57">the states in one place foreign policy</text>
  <text start="380.03" dur="5.91">and things like that it was not there to</text>
  <text start="383.39" dur="4.98">have everyone dependent on it and really</text>
  <text start="385.94" dur="5.7">think about it why would everyone have</text>
  <text start="388.37" dur="6.06">to be dependent on government why does</text>
  <text start="391.64" dur="5.64">everyone need food stamps why do people</text>
  <text start="394.43" dur="6.06">need welfare why do people need all of</text>
  <text start="397.28" dur="7.2">this think about the central bank think</text>
  <text start="400.49" dur="8.07">about the dollar losing value think</text>
  <text start="404.48" dur="5.67">about how there aren&amp;#39;t enough jobs</text>
  <text start="408.56" dur="4.65">well-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="410.15" dur="6.75">think about the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="6.27">bank moving corporations manufacturers</text>
  <text start="416.9" dur="5.07">out of the United States what does this</text>
  <text start="419.48" dur="4.53">do well it makes a lot of people below</text>
  <text start="421.97" dur="4.44">the poverty line they can&amp;#39;t find jobs</text>
  <text start="424.01" dur="3.74">how do you survive well you need to be</text>
  <text start="426.41" dur="5.279">dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="427.75" dur="6.159">you&amp;#39;re stagnant throughout life you</text>
  <text start="431.689" dur="4.8">can&amp;#39;t move up you can&amp;#39;t move down you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.909" dur="5.37">dependent on the money that government</text>
  <text start="436.489" dur="4.14">gives you if they had it their way and</text>
  <text start="439.279" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;m talking about the central bank deep</text>
  <text start="440.629" dur="4.29">state they would want everyone dependent</text>
  <text start="442.879" dur="5.01">on the government which means complete</text>
  <text start="444.919" dur="6.63">and utter control Trump is reversing</text>
  <text start="447.889" dur="6.33">this now now we know their trade talks</text>
  <text start="451.549" dur="4.26">are continuing with China and the</text>
  <text start="454.219" dur="3.51">mainstream media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="455.809" dur="3.301">well because of these tariffs and</text>
  <text start="457.729" dur="3.15">because the trade talks are not going</text>
  <text start="459.11" dur="3.089">well look at the stock market it is</text>
  <text start="460.879" dur="2.49">falling it&amp;#39;s down like six hundred</text>
  <text start="462.199" dur="5.01">points oh my god</text>

  <text start="467.209" dur="7.591">the economy well we know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="470.719" dur="7.68">happen we know that this is just a</text>
  <text start="474.8" dur="4.319">little blip actually Trump planned it</text>
  <text start="478.399" dur="3.84">this way</text>
  <text start="479.119" dur="5.64">he knew that Chinese were going to react</text>
  <text start="482.239" dur="5.61">like this he prepared for this we</text>
  <text start="484.759" dur="6.45">discussed this already and we could see</text>
  <text start="487.849" dur="6.36">already the mainstream media is jumping</text>
  <text start="491.209" dur="4.83">on this and they&amp;#39;re saying that Trump is</text>
  <text start="494.209" dur="5.13">going to be responsible for bringing</text>
  <text start="496.039" dur="5.37">down the economy The Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="499.339" dur="4.29">was out there and this is the editorial</text>
  <text start="501.409" dur="4.71">board of the Wall Street Journal bluntly</text>
  <text start="503.629" dur="5.49">called out Trump for threatening to</text>
  <text start="506.119" dur="5.61">impose more tariffs on China in an</text>
  <text start="509.119" dur="4.59">off-the-cuff weekend tweet saying he is</text>
  <text start="511.729" dur="4.59">endangering the prospects of any</text>

  <text start="516.319" dur="4.681">his own presidency according to the</text>
  <text start="519.74" dur="3.149">journal Trump is engaging in</text>
  <text start="521" dur="5.61">brinksmanship that could have a</text>
  <text start="522.889" dur="6.32">devastating effect on the economy now</text>
  <text start="526.61" dur="7.5">think about what is happening here</text>
  <text start="529.209" dur="6.94">remember Trump needs to control the</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="3.93">economic narrative and he needs to show</text>
  <text start="536.149" dur="5.211">the American People that he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="538.04" dur="6.39">complete control do you really think</text>
  <text start="541.36" dur="6.159">that he&amp;#39;s going to sit here and just say</text>
  <text start="544.43" dur="5.399">okay listen China is not agreeing I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="547.519" dur="4.29">gonna place tariffs here the stock</text>

  <text start="563.67" dur="6.18">he knew China wasn&amp;#39;t going to budge well</text>
  <text start="567.78" dur="4.86">they will be budging very very soon</text>
  <text start="569.85" dur="4.62">remember the tariffs really have no</text>
  <text start="572.64" dur="3.96">effect on the cost of the products to</text>
  <text start="574.47" dur="7.02">the everyday person here in the United</text>
  <text start="576.6" dur="8.4">States the cost is at the Chinese level</text>
  <text start="581.49" dur="6.51">and what Trump is going to do he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="585" dur="6.21">to use this against the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="588" dur="5.4">against all these individuals that are</text>
  <text start="591.21" dur="5.76">saying he is bringing down the economy</text>

  <text start="650.51" dur="4">Trump is going to push this very hard he</text>

  <text start="654.51" dur="5.82">and let everyone know that he&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="657.39" dur="4.64">longer in control of the economy then</text>
  <text start="660.33" dur="4.74">he&amp;#39;s gonna show the mainstream media is</text>
