  <text start="25.609" dur="4.201">is dave and this is episode number 70</text>
  <text start="27.47" dur="3.66">and the title of this episode is the</text>
  <text start="29.81" dur="5.13">financial collapse is going to hit like</text>
  <text start="31.13" dur="5.31">a tidal wave and a lot of stuff is</text>
  <text start="34.94" dur="3.84">happening today and I&amp;#39;ll explain why</text>
  <text start="36.44" dur="4.5">later on why I think it&amp;#39;s going to hit</text>
  <text start="38.78" dur="4.949">like a tidal wave but the Fed did come</text>
  <text start="40.94" dur="4.71">out with its minutes and it&amp;#39;s funny one</text>
  <text start="43.729" dur="5.07">that when the Fed was coming out with</text>
  <text start="45.65" dur="8.1">the information the market kind of</text>
  <text start="48.799" dur="7.051">reacted all over the place today and to</text>
  <text start="53.75" dur="3.96">me that shows one thing I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="55.85" dur="5.22">the Fed is coming out saying that they</text>
  <text start="57.71" dur="5.339">want to you know scale back taper off</text>
  <text start="61.07" dur="3.78">whatever you want to call up the amount</text>
  <text start="63.049" dur="5.631">of money printing and it&amp;#39;s funny when</text>
  <text start="64.85" dur="8.22">they say that the market took a dive and</text>
  <text start="68.68" dur="8.35">to me this this feels like it&amp;#39;s a test</text>
  <text start="73.07" dur="5.61">and it&amp;#39;s like what you know the Fed is</text>
  <text start="77.03" dur="3.27">doing is saying let&amp;#39;s see how the market</text>
  <text start="78.68" dur="6.75">reacts if we say this let&amp;#39;s see how the</text>
  <text start="80.3" dur="10.47">market reacts if I say that and it if QE</text>
  <text start="85.43" dur="9.45">is removed right now the market will</text>
  <text start="90.77" dur="6.48">completely collapse that is the only</text>
  <text start="94.88" dur="6.27">thing that&amp;#39;s keeping it afloat right now</text>
  <text start="97.25" dur="8.04">and just from the news you can tell that</text>
  <text start="101.15" dur="7.29">the market is so fragile right now I</text>
  <text start="105.29" dur="4.71">know I keep saying this but it and again</text>
  <text start="108.44" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s a disconnect from the real economy</text>
  <text start="110" dur="5.159">but people look at this as it is the</text>
  <text start="113.9" dur="3.96">economy I was speaking with someone</text>
  <text start="115.159" dur="4.921">today and he asked me how do I think the</text>
  <text start="117.86" dur="5.43">economy is doing I said well I think</text>
  <text start="120.08" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s doing poorly I said if you look at</text>
  <text start="123.29" dur="3.99">unemployment you know unemployment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="125.54" dur="3.93">very high and then he said you know but</text>
  <text start="127.28" dur="4.08">I see unemployment isn&amp;#39;t around eight</text>
  <text start="129.47" dur="4.41">percent I go yeah but did you know that</text>
  <text start="131.36" dur="4.47">they change the calculation on how they</text>
  <text start="133.88" dur="3.93">calculate unemployment</text>
  <text start="135.83" dur="4.35">you use the old calculation it&amp;#39;s around</text>
  <text start="137.81" dur="6.9">twenty-two twenty-three percent and he</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="7.68">was you know like shocked and couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="144.71" dur="5.61">believe what I was saying and had no</text>
  <text start="147.86" dur="4.46">clue that this happened and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="150.32" dur="5.31">tell you right now most of the people</text>
  <text start="152.32" dur="5.71">have no clue they have no idea what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.63" dur="4.5">happening they have no idea that these</text>
  <text start="158.03" dur="3.87">things have been manipulated they have</text>
  <text start="160.13" dur="3.81">no all they see he just said yeah but</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="5.13">the stock market&amp;#39;s up but that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="163.94" dur="7.47">anyone is looking at it is a it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="167.03" dur="7.56">perfect illusion it&amp;#39;s like the perfect</text>
  <text start="171.41" dur="4.77">magic trick you know when a magician has</text>
  <text start="174.59" dur="3.9">the sleight of hand and you&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="176.18" dur="3.39">in one area and he&amp;#39;s doing something</text>
  <text start="178.49" dur="3.87">else like putting the quarter in his</text>
  <text start="179.57" dur="5.19">pocket this is what the stock market is</text>
  <text start="182.36" dur="5.01">everyone&amp;#39;s looking at the stock market</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="6.26">while everything else over to the right</text>
  <text start="187.37" dur="8.25">is going on and nobody notices it and</text>
  <text start="191.02" dur="9.34">you know this is just unbelievable but</text>
  <text start="195.62" dur="9.649">it looks like boch Kim says the world</text>
  <text start="200.36" dur="9.3">may face rate risk if us exits from QE</text>
  <text start="205.269" dur="9.94">now even they&amp;#39;re saying if you if us</text>
  <text start="209.66" dur="8.09">exits from QE basically that&amp;#39;s it the</text>
  <text start="215.209" dur="6.871">whole thing comes tumbling down Japan</text>
  <text start="217.75" dur="9.489">boom it comes tumbling down and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.08" dur="8.49">pretty much it and basically like I said</text>
  <text start="227.239" dur="5.151">before the Fed is stuck and I know Peter</text>
  <text start="230.57" dur="5.16">Schiff says it&amp;#39;s a lot you know the the</text>
  <text start="232.39" dur="4.93">it&amp;#39;s basically like a drug addict you</text>
  <text start="235.73" dur="3.24">know continually taking drugs can</text>
  <text start="237.32" dur="3.36">continually taking drugs you know</text>
  <text start="238.97" dur="3.45">feeling better but you know you need</text>
  <text start="240.68" dur="5.76">more drugs to even feel more you know</text>
  <text start="242.42" dur="7.68">much more better and eventually to kick</text>
  <text start="246.44" dur="6.84">the habit you have to go cold turkey the</text>
  <text start="250.1" dur="6.48">same thing that&amp;#39;s happening here is they</text>
  <text start="253.28" dur="6.12">are continually feeding the system with</text>
  <text start="256.58" dur="5.88">this money printing and eventually they</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="7.55">either have to go cold turkey and stop</text>
  <text start="262.46" dur="4.49">it or continue printing</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="4.859">but if they taper back it won&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="5.19">because the markets won&amp;#39;t be satisfied</text>
  <text start="272.009" dur="6.151">and they&amp;#39;ll start falling and then</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="5.549">people will get nervous and then people</text>
  <text start="278.16" dur="4.74">will start selling institutional</text>
  <text start="281.039" dur="3.66">investors will start selling and then</text>
  <text start="282.9" dur="4.739">BOOM before you know it we have a</text>
  <text start="284.699" dur="5.491">complete collapse if you continue pretty</text>
  <text start="287.639" dur="4.951">continually prints we have what&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="290.19" dur="4.41">a bubble in the stock market in the</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="7.139">housing sector in the Treasury bond</text>
  <text start="294.6" dur="8.879">sector and those pop and we have the</text>
  <text start="299.729" dur="5.91">same problem basically in the minutes</text>
  <text start="303.479" dur="4.681">which pretty much sums up that there is</text>
  <text start="305.639" dur="4.891">a bubble I mean they don&amp;#39;t come out and</text>
  <text start="308.16" dur="7.14">say it you know just like they said in</text>
  <text start="310.53" dur="9.69">2008 the sub T sub prime problem is</text>
  <text start="315.3" dur="8.16">contained now contained for who the</text>
  <text start="320.22" dur="6.69">American people know contained for them</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="5.87">so they don&amp;#39;t get hurt same thing here</text>
  <text start="326.91" dur="5.039">he goes on to say a few participants</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="4.99">expressed concern that conditions in</text>
  <text start="331.949" dur="5.101">certain US financial markets were</text>
  <text start="334.32" dur="4.95">becoming too buoyant one participant</text>
  <text start="337.05" dur="4.17">caution that the emergence of financial</text>
  <text start="339.27" dur="4.769">imbalances could prove difficult for</text>
  <text start="341.22" dur="6.09">regulators to identify and address and</text>
  <text start="344.039" dur="5.551">that if that and that it would be</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="4.289">appropriate to adjust monetary policy to</text>
  <text start="349.59" dur="6.27">help guard against risk to financial</text>
  <text start="351.599" dur="6.54">stability basically it&amp;#39;s a lot of mumbo</text>
  <text start="355.86" dur="4.589">jumbo basically the same we have a</text>
  <text start="358.139" dur="5.31">bubble and we need to do something about</text>
  <text start="360.449" dur="5.011">these bubbles and they are it&amp;#39;s becoming</text>
  <text start="363.449" dur="5.581">risky and they know this and this is why</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="6.23">they want to scale back or do something</text>
  <text start="369.03" dur="5.46">else but they&amp;#39;re kind of stuck and</text>
  <text start="371.69" dur="5.68">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out what</text>
  <text start="374.49" dur="9.899">they&amp;#39;re going to do now in regards to</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="8.609">this and on the people someone wrote</text>
  <text start="384.389" dur="4.5">something very interesting and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="385.979" dur="6.72">to read it because I thought it made a</text>
  <text start="388.889" dur="5.4">lot of sense and basically it goes on to</text>
  <text start="392.699" dur="4.501">say and you can go on to the people and</text>
  <text start="394.289" dur="6.541">it&amp;#39;s under the economic collapse poll</text>
  <text start="397.2" dur="8.31">and it says we just got the confirmation</text>
  <text start="400.83" dur="7.71">from the Fed minutes the stock act was</text>
  <text start="405.51" dur="6.75">done so the Senate and reps can can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="408.54" dur="5.7">to jail for this Ben will tell them when</text>
  <text start="412.26" dur="5.58">he&amp;#39;s going to pull the rug out the</text>
  <text start="414.24" dur="6.84">record number of short sells talking</text>
  <text start="417.84" dur="5.04">over 2 trillion u.s. dollars he ran the</text>
  <text start="421.08" dur="3.6">market up he&amp;#39;ll tell the banks and</text>
  <text start="422.88" dur="3.81">elected officials he&amp;#39;s gonna pull the</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="4.32">rug and bam we are left holding</text>
  <text start="426.69" dur="4.68">worthless paper a two trillion dollar</text>
  <text start="429" dur="5.06">short is like a five trillion profit</text>
  <text start="431.37" dur="6.42">they are selling now they&amp;#39;ll buy back in</text>
  <text start="434.06" dur="6.52">for margin at the drop rate why else was</text>
  <text start="437.79" dur="4.91">everyone else selling into the rise they</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t have the stock act to hide behind</text>
  <text start="442.7" dur="5.32">10-year bond broke two percent for the</text>
  <text start="445.08" dur="5.67">first time in years today on the news</text>
  <text start="448.02" dur="6.84">interest rate rise equals default and</text>
  <text start="450.75" dur="6.87">bond failure gold edged higher at the at</text>
  <text start="454.86" dur="5.37">the same time these are inverse</text>
  <text start="457.62" dur="5.52">indicators this is setting up for this</text>
  <text start="460.23" dur="4.41">year if we make it to 2014 it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="463.14" dur="3.99">because the rug is tossed back onto the</text>
  <text start="464.64" dur="4.95">bus a two percent drop would could</text>
  <text start="467.13" dur="4.08">initiate a flash crash depends on volume</text>
  <text start="469.59" dur="5.15">of single trades and margin calls on</text>
  <text start="471.21" dur="6.48">these high shorts could easily do it so</text>
  <text start="474.74" dur="4.12">this goes along with other things that</text>
  <text start="477.69" dur="3.51">I&amp;#39;ve been hearing today and there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="478.86" dur="5.4">article MarketWatch saying that they</text>
  <text start="481.2" dur="5.76">feel around August September we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="484.26" dur="5.33">to have some type of stock market crash</text>
  <text start="486.96" dur="8.03">and it&amp;#39;s funny because the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="489.59" dur="9.4">has been pushed off until September and</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="7.75">I&amp;#39;m hearing a lot of reports coming in</text>
  <text start="498.99" dur="8.04">saying that you know august/september is</text>
  <text start="502.74" dur="6.87">the time frame and you know we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="507.03" dur="7.949">to say but I mean it&amp;#39;s starting to look</text>
  <text start="509.61" dur="9.81">this way now the other interesting is</text>
  <text start="514.979" dur="6.891">thing is is that they pushed off the</text>
  <text start="519.42" dur="5.46">debt ceiling they suspended it and</text>
  <text start="521.87" dur="5.14">basically the read this the Treasury</text>
