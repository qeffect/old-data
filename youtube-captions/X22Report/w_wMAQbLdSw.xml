  <text start="332.41" dur="11.46">public and you can&amp;#39;t track me but they</text>
  <text start="338.02" dur="10.5">don&amp;#39;t care we see that US intelligence</text>
  <text start="343.87" dur="10.17">agencies are going to boost surveillance</text>
  <text start="348.52" dur="6.42">on the American public now clapper James</text>
  <text start="354.04" dur="6.09">clapper the Director of National</text>

  <text start="363.07" dur="4.98">the Senate arms service Intelligence</text>
  <text start="364.81" dur="5.81">Committee saying that okay because of</text>
  <text start="368.05" dur="5.4">the threats facing the United States</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="7.06">we&amp;#39;re going to boost their surveillance</text>
  <text start="373.45" dur="7.529">on the American people and they might</text>
  <text start="377.68" dur="5.43">use new generation of smart household</text>
  <text start="380.979" dur="5.371">devices to increase to increase their</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="8.09">surveillance capabilities so what does</text>
  <text start="386.35" dur="9.629">this mean well they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="391.2" dur="7.44">objects physical objects devices that</text>
  <text start="395.979" dur="7.821">connect to the internet like vehicles</text>
  <text start="398.64" dur="9.73">buildings electronics software sensors</text>
  <text start="403.8" dur="8.85">or anything else and they will turn</text>
  <text start="408.37" dur="7.52">these devices into spying apparatus</text>
  <text start="412.65" dur="8.11">a--&amp;#39;s where they can listen in and</text>
  <text start="415.89" dur="6.79">understand what is going on so basically</text>
  <text start="420.76" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re saying we don&amp;#39;t care what the</text>
  <text start="422.68" dur="4.14">bill of rights say we don&amp;#39;t care that</text>
  <text start="425.5" dur="3.35">you have these rights the Fourth</text>
  <text start="426.82" dur="3.16">Amendment it makes no difference to us</text>
  <text start="428.85" dur="4.61">we</text>
  <text start="429.98" dur="7.56">will continually spy on every single</text>
  <text start="433.46" dur="8.64">person we will track you we will monitor</text>
  <text start="437.54" dur="8.1">you and we will gain access to your</text>
  <text start="442.1" dur="9.32">devices and this is how we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.64" dur="7.68">approaching the problem of terrorism</text>
  <text start="451.42" dur="5.41">well this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="5.52">terrorism this has to do with the United</text>
  <text start="456.83" dur="5.04">States government central bankers so</text>
  <text start="458.84" dur="4.92">worried about the population so worried</text>
  <text start="461.87" dur="5.52">about what the people are thinking so</text>
  <text start="463.76" dur="6.96">worried about their positions their</text>
  <text start="467.39" dur="5.76">power structure that they need to keep</text>
  <text start="470.72" dur="5.91">an eye on as many people as they</text>
  <text start="473.15" dur="7.59">possibly can and basically correlate the</text>
  <text start="476.63" dur="5.97">data to find out where the threat is</text>
  <text start="480.74" dur="3.99">because as we know they&amp;#39;re setting up a</text>
  <text start="482.6" dur="6.45">task force to go after anti-government</text>
  <text start="484.73" dur="8.34">extremists and they&amp;#39;re using Oregon as</text>
  <text start="489.05" dur="5.55">the test case and we see why all this is</text>
  <text start="493.07" dur="4.77">happening at this point we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="494.6" dur="6.06">happening in France right now where the</text>
  <text start="497.84" dur="6.6">government is taken on more of the power</text>
  <text start="500.66" dur="7.26">of more like a dictatorship where the</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="6.33">people don&amp;#39;t have the rights and we see</text>
  <text start="507.92" dur="8.01">that each country it&amp;#39;s definitely moving</text>
  <text start="510.77" dur="8.49">in this direction now the United States</text>
  <text start="515.93" dur="5.81">Preventive Services Task Force they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="519.26" dur="5.91">making a recommendation right now and</text>
  <text start="521.74" dur="7.9">they want mandatory depression screening</text>
  <text start="525.17" dur="6.48">for all Americans they want to force</text>
  <text start="529.64" dur="4.11">health insurance companies to pay for</text>
  <text start="531.65" dur="3.78">the screening and to be on a bomb a care</text>
  <text start="533.75" dur="4.98">to be on this insurance they want</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="5.97">everyone&amp;#39;s screen for depression well we</text>
  <text start="538.73" dur="7.59">see there&amp;#39;s a couple agendas associated</text>
  <text start="541.4" dur="6.66">with this one the pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="546.32" dur="4.5">companies they&amp;#39;re going to be issuing</text>
  <text start="548.06" dur="6.12">drugs too many people and their profits</text>
  <text start="550.82" dur="6.41">are going to soar to under Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="554.18" dur="5.4">executive orders for it gun control</text>
  <text start="557.23" dur="4.18">guess what if you have depression and</text>
  <text start="559.58" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re on medication you can&amp;#39;t own a</text>
  <text start="561.41" dur="6.239">weapon</text>
  <text start="563.48" dur="6.719">three as the economy comes down they can</text>
  <text start="567.649" dur="5.37">keep everyone doped up people won&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="570.199" dur="5.01">what&amp;#39;s going on and I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.019" dur="4.32">many more associated with this and then</text>
  <text start="575.209" dur="4.731">we see everything that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="577.339" dur="5.581">doing with the executive orders and</text>
  <text start="579.94" dur="5.23">Obamacare how all this is now fitting</text>
  <text start="582.92" dur="6.719">into each other and where they&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="585.17" dur="8.31">with this I mean we are in very scary</text>
  <text start="589.639" dur="6.741">times right now and every day that</text>
  <text start="593.48" dur="5.34">passes it&amp;#39;s getting scarier and scarier</text>
  <text start="596.38" dur="6.6">the rights are being chipped away from</text>
  <text start="598.82" dur="6.72">the people and this is spreading and</text>
  <text start="602.98" dur="5.08">eventually people are going to wake up</text>
  <text start="605.54" dur="4.919">when it&amp;#39;s too late it always happens</text>
  <text start="608.06" dur="6.54">like this well it&amp;#39;s good for the people</text>
  <text start="610.459" dur="5.701">they say well it&amp;#39;s okay until it affects</text>
  <text start="614.6" dur="3.27">them and they say wait wait wait wait a</text>
  <text start="616.16" dur="3">minute what I mean you can just come</text>
  <text start="617.87" dur="3.54">right into my house without a warrant</text>
  <text start="619.16" dur="4.229">what do you mean you can just look into</text>
  <text start="621.41" dur="4.89">my bank account what do you mean you can</text>
  <text start="623.389" dur="7.56">look through my car when this starts to</text>
  <text start="626.3" dur="8.159">happen it&amp;#39;s already too late they</text>
  <text start="630.949" dur="5.281">already have the control and this is why</text>
  <text start="634.459" dur="6.801">everyone at this point needs to stand up</text>
  <text start="636.23" dur="8.099">and say no this is not okay anymore and</text>
  <text start="641.26" dur="5.8">we need to start by getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="644.329" dur="5.75">central bank we need to get rid of most</text>
  <text start="647.06" dur="6.42">of the government we need to basically</text>
  <text start="650.079" dur="5.981">restart the entire system without the</text>
  <text start="653.48" dur="4.08">central bank and we need to set up new</text>
  <text start="656.06" dur="4.23">rules for the government where</text>

  <text start="669.26" dur="7.889">not allowed except any type of funds in</text>
  <text start="671.98" dur="7.63">any manner whatsoever because these</text>
  <text start="677.149" dur="4.74">people in government they&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="679.61" dur="5.43">be working for the people not for</text>

  <text start="992.029" dur="7.171">war and people fleeing everywhere</text>
  <text start="996.07" dur="5.01">because we already see in Europe that if</text>
  <text start="999.2" dur="5.79">they can&amp;#39;t get everything under control</text>
  <text start="1001.08" dur="6.49">the Schengen might be suspended for two</text>

  <text start="1015.1" dur="8.46">done Austria hungry they&amp;#39;ve already done</text>
  <text start="1019" dur="7.23">this they said we have until march maybe</text>
  <text start="1023.56" dur="4.92">the summer and if they can&amp;#39;t come up</text>
  <text start="1026.23" dur="7.979">with any type of solution the Schengen</text>
  <text start="1028.48" dur="8.729">goes down the drain and that&amp;#39;s it out in</text>

  <text start="1037.209" dur="3.99">preparing and getting ready to go into</text>
  <text start="1038.74" dur="4.339">my soul and the United States is yeah</text>
  <text start="1041.199" dur="4.081">we&amp;#39;re not going to be a part of this</text>
  <text start="1043.079" dur="4.571">this is coming from Lieutenant General</text>
  <text start="1045.28" dur="5.01">vincent stewart director of the Defense</text>
  <text start="1047.65" dur="5.07">Intelligence Agency saying yeah at this</text>
  <text start="1050.29" dur="4.44">time the muscle operation is going to be</text>
  <text start="1052.72" dur="5.31">way too complicated almost like that</text>
  <text start="1054.73" dur="5.85">Ramadi offensive we weren&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1058.03" dur="4.529">involved in that either because you know</text>
  <text start="1060.58" dur="3.8">it was just too complicated because we&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1062.559" dur="3.721">have to defend the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="1064.38" dur="3.37">everyone would know that we were</text>
  <text start="1066.28" dur="3.81">defending them and the same things going</text>
  <text start="1067.75" dur="4.62">to happen in my soul so we&amp;#39;re just out</text>
  <text start="1070.09" dur="4.589">at this point so basically what is</text>
  <text start="1072.37" dur="5.4">happening is the u.s. is stepping back</text>
  <text start="1074.679" dur="4.711">and they know at this point there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1077.77" dur="4.56">nothing they can do because it would</text>
  <text start="1079.39" dur="6">completely be obvious that they were</text>
  <text start="1082.33" dur="4.2">protecting their proxy armies so most</text>
  <text start="1085.39" dur="3.539">likely they&amp;#39;re going to try to get them</text>
  <text start="1086.53" dur="4.56">out of there airlift them out we saw</text>
  <text start="1088.929" dur="4.5">this having in Ramadi but the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="1091.09" dur="4.32">troops are getting ready and prepared to</text>
  <text start="1093.429" dur="4.711">go in there and most likely they will</text>
  <text start="1095.41" dur="6.24">clear that area</text>
  <text start="1098.14" dur="5.79">Lavrov is out there saying that Isis</text>
  <text start="1101.65" dur="6.81">leaders stay in constant contact with</text>
  <text start="1103.93" dur="7.95">Turkish government they say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1108.46" dur="7.95">developing a new approach to the war in</text>

  <text start="1116.41" dur="8.19">Islamic state command is holding back</text>
  <text start="1121.15" dur="8.04">door negotiations with Turkish</text>
  <text start="1124.6" dur="9.11">leadership for this new plan and we see</text>
  <text start="1129.19" dur="8.13">a new plan developing we see the US has</text>
  <text start="1133.71" dur="6.46">commandeered an airfield in Syria</text>
  <text start="1137.32" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re extending it to bring in c-130</text>
  <text start="1140.17" dur="6.48">transport planes turkey is building a</text>
  <text start="1142.9" dur="7.74">war a wall we have jay johnson from DHS</text>
  <text start="1146.65" dur="5.64">he&amp;#39;s assisting there Israel is putting</text>
  <text start="1150.64" dur="6.9">up a fence all around its country</text>
  <text start="1152.29" dur="10.59">Tunisia is putting up a wall between</text>
  <text start="1157.54" dur="8.19">Libya and itself we see amphibious</text>
  <text start="1162.88" dur="5.21">warships from the US sailing over to the</text>
  <text start="1165.73" dur="6.15">mid east the same ships that were used</text>
  <text start="1168.09" dur="7.93">back in 2013 during that sarin gas false</text>
  <text start="1171.88" dur="10.46">flag with Assad and we see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1176.02" dur="6.32">getting prepared and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1182.46" dur="6.88">push the peace talks once again in Syria</text>
  <text start="1187.14" dur="4.03">Moscow saying it&amp;#39;s impossible to</text>
  <text start="1189.34" dur="5.37">negotiate with the US and the Saudi back</text>
  <text start="1191.17" dur="6.6">opposition the Syrian opposition they</text>
  <text start="1194.71" dur="4.74">demand a ceasefire right now and they</text>
  <text start="1197.77" dur="8.04">want humanitarian aid before talks</text>
  <text start="1199.45" dur="10.95">continue now it looks like they tried to</text>
  <text start="1205.81" dur="8.04">assassinate Assad his mother passed away</text>
  <text start="1210.4" dur="9.06">and they were having a funeral convoy</text>
  <text start="1213.85" dur="8.22">and they were missile attacks on the</text>
  <text start="1219.46" dur="4.92">convoy four of his convoy members they</text>
  <text start="1222.07" dur="6.26">were killed in the attack and they were</text>
  <text start="1224.38" dur="7.499">trying to hit Assad now most likely</text>
  <text start="1228.33" dur="6.459">actually 99.999%</text>
  <text start="1231.879" dur="5.94">it was the u.s. it was Israel it was the</text>
  <text start="1234.789" dur="4.38">UK I mean it could have been any of the</text>
  <text start="1237.819" dur="3.51">terrorist groups they got instructions</text>
  <text start="1239.169" dur="4.91">they knew where Assad was going to be</text>
  <text start="1241.329" dur="4.861">and they made an attempt on his life</text>
  <text start="1244.079" dur="4.03">because that would solve a lot of their</text>
  <text start="1246.19" dur="4.949">problems wouldn&amp;#39;t it let&amp;#39;s get rid of</text>
  <text start="1248.109" dur="6.12">Assad for remember Russia is not there</text>
  <text start="1251.139" dur="5.551">because of Assad Russia is there to keep</text>
  <text start="1254.229" dur="5.69">the country&amp;#39;s sovereignty saying there</text>
  <text start="1256.69" dur="7.529">is there no country should be allowed to</text>
  <text start="1259.919" dur="6.46">invade another country and replace</text>
  <text start="1264.219" dur="4.65">whatever government is there the people</text>
  <text start="1266.379" dur="6.33">should decide and I completely agree</text>
  <text start="1268.869" dur="6.48">with that NATO is going to continue to</text>
  <text start="1272.709" dur="4.68">deploy Patriot batteries to turkey they</text>
  <text start="1275.349" dur="4.43">have the AWAC surveillance planes they</text>

  <text start="1285.099" dur="8.76">Black Sea NATO is surrounding turkey at</text>
  <text start="1288.639" dur="8.7">this point why is there really a threat</text>
  <text start="1293.859" dur="8.46">to Turkey not at this point is turkey a</text>
  <text start="1297.339" dur="8.49">threat to Syria yes is turkey going to</text>
  <text start="1302.319" dur="7.5">mount some type of offensive in Syria</text>
  <text start="1305.829" dur="6.84">it&amp;#39;s starting to look like that now the</text>
  <text start="1309.819" dur="6.41">UN is telling Turkey to open its borders</text>
  <text start="1312.669" dur="8.521">and the bombing in Aleppo and we know</text>

  <text start="1321.19" dur="6.629">Aleppo right now and this is a big big</text>
  <text start="1325.179" dur="9">problem for the US for the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1327.819" dur="12.39">and at this point we are looking at a</text>
  <text start="1334.179" dur="10.47">situation where the u.s. is coming up</text>

  <text start="1372.94" dur="3.96">at this point they can&amp;#39;t bring in their</text>
