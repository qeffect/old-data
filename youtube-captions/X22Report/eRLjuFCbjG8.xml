  <text start="103.25" dur="6.119">but when all that is said and done the</text>
  <text start="107.27" dur="4.62">main focus is going to be on the central</text>
  <text start="109.369" dur="6.78">bank and what we&amp;#39;re watching out in the</text>
  <text start="111.89" dur="7.649">UK this is the coming attraction of how</text>
  <text start="116.149" dur="7.61">they&amp;#39;re going to fight against the</text>
  <text start="119.539" dur="7.2">Patriots and how they&amp;#39;re going to resist</text>
  <text start="123.759" dur="6.67">against the Patriots because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="126.739" dur="5.461">want their system removed and that is</text>
  <text start="130.429" dur="4.92">what we&amp;#39;re watching this is the first</text>
  <text start="132.2" dur="5.52">stage of it all and we know that the</text>
  <text start="135.349" dur="5.151">central bank the EU the establishment</text>
  <text start="137.72" dur="5.58">will not allow the brexit to happen</text>
  <text start="140.5" dur="7.72">remember what happens if it does happen</text>
  <text start="143.3" dur="8.7">the world gets a view of what it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="148.22" dur="7.56">where non-elected leaders the central</text>
  <text start="152" dur="5.969">bank doesn&amp;#39;t call the shots guess what</text>
  <text start="155.78" dur="4.799">the central bank doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone to</text>
  <text start="157.969" dur="4.591">see this this will go against everything</text>
  <text start="160.579" dur="4.77">that they&amp;#39;ve been lying about</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="4.71">and then everyone will learn the truth</text>
  <text start="165.349" dur="3.871">they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen so what</text>
  <text start="167.27" dur="4.65">are they going to do they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="169.22" dur="5.01">everything they can to stop the brexit</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="4.62">to stop the removal of the central bank</text>
  <text start="174.23" dur="6.6">and remember there are many layers</text>
  <text start="176.54" dur="5.97">before we get to the source and we can</text>
  <text start="180.83" dur="5.67">see that these layers are going to block</text>
  <text start="182.51" dur="7.62">the Patriots at every turn just expect</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="7.29">that and we can see that Bors Johnson</text>

  <text start="206.15" dur="5.88">necessary top judges should be subjected</text>
  <text start="209.84" dur="4.83">to u.s. style accountability and he went</text>
  <text start="212.03" dur="5.459">on to say that the lessons of America</text>
  <text start="214.67" dur="4.53">are relevant and of course he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="219.2" dur="4.92">political appointment of judges and</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="7.02">other measures think about what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.12" dur="7.44">saying here he&amp;#39;s realizing that there is</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="5.25">corruption within the legal system just</text>
  <text start="231.56" dur="3.709">like there&amp;#39;s corruption here in the</text>
  <text start="233" dur="5.22">United States within the legal system</text>
  <text start="235.269" dur="5.261">certain individuals were placed in</text>
  <text start="238.22" dur="5.25">certain positions and certain</text>
  <text start="240.53" dur="7.17">individuals have been blackmailed to</text>
  <text start="243.47" dur="7.519">carry out a certain agenda Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="7.11">is realizing this and he&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="250.989" dur="6.101">pushing for change now the central bank</text>
  <text start="254.81" dur="4.59">the EU the establishment they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="257.09" dur="4.26">the same tactics that they&amp;#39;re using on</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="4.05">Trump Sky News tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="261.35" dur="4.2">the Greater London Authority has</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="3.99">referred Prime Minister Boris Johnson to</text>
  <text start="265.55" dur="4.32">the independent office for police</text>
  <text start="267.44" dur="4.56">conduct for a possible investigation</text>

  <text start="280.72" dur="5.56">they want him to resign they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="283.76" dur="4.469">an investigation what are they doing</text>
  <text start="286.28" dur="4.319">here they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re following the</text>
  <text start="288.229" dur="5.281">same exact playbook as they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="290.599" dur="5.611">with Trump but we know that</text>
  <text start="293.51" dur="3.59">Boris Johnson understands what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="296.21" dur="5.46">on here</text>
  <text start="297.1" dur="7.21">Trump truss Boris Johnson now does this</text>
  <text start="301.67" dur="4.53">mean he&amp;#39;s going to succeed hopefully he</text>
  <text start="304.31" dur="3.99">does hopefully he&amp;#39;s strong enough</text>
  <text start="306.2" dur="5.64">hopefully he has those individuals</text>
  <text start="308.3" dur="7.23">behind him to counter everything the</text>
  <text start="311.84" dur="7.08">deep state the EU the establishment is</text>
  <text start="315.53" dur="4.74">trying to do here because this is what</text>
  <text start="318.92" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s going to look like actually I think</text>
  <text start="320.27" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse once we get</text>
  <text start="322.31" dur="5.19">to the main main source of the central</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="5.43">bank in apparatus when we go to remove</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="4.41">it I think this is when everyone is</text>
  <text start="330.08" dur="3.78">going to see the real battle yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.91" dur="3.42">watching the mainstream media now with</text>
  <text start="333.86" dur="3.9">the swamp and how they&amp;#39;re spending the</text>
  <text start="335.33" dur="4.62">truth just wait until the central bank</text>
  <text start="337.76" dur="4.26">is hit that is going to be something</text>
  <text start="339.95" dur="4.02">completely different so what are they</text>
  <text start="342.02" dur="4.65">going to find with Boris Johnson most</text>
  <text start="343.97" dur="4.44">likely nothing they&amp;#39;re trying to build a</text>
  <text start="346.67" dur="3.69">narrative that&amp;#39;s what the deep State the</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="4.35">EU the establishment is trying to do</text>
  <text start="350.36" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re trying to build this narrative</text>
  <text start="352.76" dur="5.49">where he looks guilty what do you think</text>
  <text start="356.42" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;ve done with Trump they built a</text>
  <text start="358.25" dur="3.75">narrative to make it seem like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.41" dur="4.74">guilty of course it&amp;#39;s all propaganda</text>
  <text start="362" dur="4.98">they have no evidence or facts but we</text>
  <text start="365.15" dur="4.56">can see they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing out</text>
  <text start="366.98" dur="4.5">in the UK as they were doing here in the</text>
  <text start="369.71" dur="3.21">United States now here in the United</text>
  <text start="371.48" dur="4.38">States we understand that the central</text>
  <text start="372.92" dur="6.15">bank system is completely imploding it</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="6.54">does not work long-term and when we look</text>
  <text start="379.07" dur="5.94">at wages debt and the wealth effect you</text>
  <text start="382.4" dur="4.41">can see it now according to the latest</text>
  <text start="385.01" dur="4.26">census bureau figures released this</text>
  <text start="386.81" dur="5.55">month real American incomes remain</text>
  <text start="389.27" dur="5.67">essentially flat in 2018 after three</text>
  <text start="392.36" dur="4.68">straight years of growth median</text>
  <text start="394.94" dur="3.66">household income was around 63 thousand</text>
  <text start="397.04" dur="4.97">one hundred seventy nine and 2018 an</text>
  <text start="398.6" dur="6.87">uptick of about point nine percent but</text>
  <text start="402.01" dur="6.58">when we go back in time the medium</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="10.18">household income in the US is unchanged</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="11.92">since 1989 it&amp;#39;s pretty much flat while</text>
  <text start="415.65" dur="8.64">the top 1% they nearly rose around 4</text>
  <text start="420.51" dur="6.629">times since the 80s that&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="424.29" dur="3.83">difference right there and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="427.139" dur="5.491">problem</text>
  <text start="428.12" dur="7.45">we have a problem in the system we have</text>
  <text start="432.63" dur="6.39">the upper tier and then we have the</text>
  <text start="435.57" dur="6.27">lower tier and as you can see over a</text>
  <text start="439.02" dur="7.709">long period of time a central bank</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="6.63">system does not work it implodes on</text>
  <text start="446.729" dur="4.831">itself and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="448.47" dur="5.64">right now in the beginning stages we all</text>
  <text start="451.56" dur="4.8">understand there&amp;#39;s inflation we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="4.559">coming out off of a sound money system</text>
  <text start="456.36" dur="4.71">and then they start creating currency</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="5.101">which means the dollar starts to lose</text>
  <text start="461.07" dur="5.04">value and everyone thinks this is</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="4.8">fantastic in the beginning oh look my</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="5.48">house went up oh look my salary went up</text>
  <text start="468.57" dur="5.909">oh look wait a minute now I have to pay</text>
  <text start="471.59" dur="6.4">20 times more for groceries than I did</text>
  <text start="474.479" dur="7.231">before yes this is all part of it think</text>
  <text start="477.99" dur="6.179">about it take two households one that is</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="4.41">still unsound money making $50,000 a</text>
  <text start="484.169" dur="5.911">year I&amp;#39;m just picking that number out of</text>
  <text start="486.12" dur="6.299">the clear blue sky here $50,000 a year</text>
  <text start="490.08" dur="5.76">there are no credit cards there is no</text>
  <text start="492.419" dur="7.641">debt and there&amp;#39;s no taxes it&amp;#39;s backed by</text>
  <text start="495.84" dur="8.13">sound money the value of that dollar</text>
  <text start="500.06" dur="6.85">remains the same so you go to the</text>
  <text start="503.97" dur="5.58">grocery store and you can buy 20 items</text>
  <text start="506.91" dur="4.17">with that dollar then you have another</text>
  <text start="509.55" dur="5.03">household which is on the central bank</text>
  <text start="511.08" dur="6.06">system they&amp;#39;re making $50,000 a year</text>
  <text start="514.58" dur="7.12">we&amp;#39;ve come off the sound money system</text>
  <text start="517.14" dur="7.59">now the dollar is losing value but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="521.7" dur="4.889">at the end stage of the system we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="3.479">both at the end stage of the system the</text>
  <text start="526.589" dur="3.841">first individuals still on sound money</text>
  <text start="528.209" dur="5.911">but there is no end stage because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.43" dur="6.27">sound money there&amp;#39;s no interest on the</text>
  <text start="534.12" dur="6.63">money that is created because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.7" dur="7.83">backed by something like gold so that</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="5.64">value stays the same the other system is</text>
  <text start="544.53" dur="4.95">the central bank system where we are</text>
  <text start="546.39" dur="7.4">today so you&amp;#39;re making $50,000 a year</text>
  <text start="549.48" dur="6.96">and the dollar continually loses value</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="5.74">when you look at the other household</text>
  <text start="556.44" dur="10.71">that $1 paid for 20 items in the grocery</text>
  <text start="559.53" dur="10.92">store in the Central Bank household that</text>
  <text start="567.15" dur="6.57">20 dot that $1 can&amp;#39;t buy anything it</text>
  <text start="570.45" dur="7.29">takes 20 dollars to purchase groceries</text>
  <text start="573.72" dur="7.95">but the cart is only filled up a quarter</text>
  <text start="577.74" dur="7.94">of the way big difference now to survive</text>
  <text start="581.67" dur="5.91">this individual needs to take out credit</text>
  <text start="585.68" dur="3.97">because they need to make up the</text>
  <text start="587.58" dur="6.81">difference because how else will they</text>
  <text start="589.65" dur="7.38">survive because with inflation you see</text>
  <text start="594.39" dur="5.52">everything continually rising and rising</text>
  <text start="597.03" dur="7.11">and rising wages are not they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="599.91" dur="6.48">stagnant for what 30 years so now you</text>
  <text start="604.14" dur="6.03">need to take on credit so you&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="606.39" dur="5.97">$50,000 a year your money doesn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="610.17" dur="4.89">that far you can&amp;#39;t buy groceries so you</text>
  <text start="612.36" dur="6.15">have to use debt you use debt to</text>
  <text start="615.06" dur="6.93">purchase the groceries and you start</text>
  <text start="618.51" dur="5.49">racking up debt so now you have over the</text>
  <text start="621.99" dur="4.38">year say 10 or 12 thousand dollars worth</text>
  <text start="624" dur="3.81">of debt now you have interest on top of</text>
  <text start="626.37" dur="6.38">that you know credit card interest is</text>
  <text start="627.81" dur="7.37">what 20 30 % maybe if you&amp;#39;re lucky 15</text>
  <text start="632.75" dur="5.26">but you still have to pay that interest</text>
  <text start="635.18" dur="5.11">now as time goes on and you look both at</text>
  <text start="638.01" dur="5.61">both households what do you say the</text>
  <text start="640.29" dur="7.23">sound money household their dollar still</text>
  <text start="643.62" dur="6.09">fills up the cart with 20 items the</text>
  <text start="647.52" dur="5.37">central bank household they&amp;#39;ve taken on</text>
  <text start="649.71" dur="5.97">more debt now they&amp;#39;re up to 18 thousand</text>
  <text start="652.89" dur="6.12">and the $20.00 that used to spend on</text>
  <text start="655.68" dur="4.83">groceries now it takes 30 dollars to</text>
  <text start="659.01" dur="4.68">spend on those groceries this is why</text>
  <text start="660.51" dur="6.6">you&amp;#39;re adding on more debt look what</text>
  <text start="663.69" dur="6.06">happens here everything starts to fall</text>
  <text start="667.11" dur="5.19">apart for that individual making 50,000</text>
  <text start="669.75" dur="4.5">and for those people saying well I get a</text>
  <text start="672.3" dur="5.04">bump in cost-of-living all right let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="674.25" dur="4.11">give you the 2% in cost-of-living how</text>
  <text start="677.34" dur="4.08">does that help you</text>
  <text start="678.36" dur="4.84">it doesn&amp;#39;t why because the next year</text>
  <text start="681.42" dur="3.88">inflation</text>
  <text start="683.2" dur="4.23">which is hidden which is not really</text>
  <text start="685.3" dur="5.279">reporting on makes it even worse so you</text>
