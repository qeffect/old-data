  <text start="128.08" dur="5.34">the panic that the deep state is in and</text>
  <text start="130.6" dur="6.39">we pointed out this is why they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="133.42" dur="6.18">all this right now cue right now has</text>
  <text start="136.99" dur="4.62">been dark for many days and a lot of</text>
  <text start="139.6" dur="4.35">people have their theories of why cue is</text>
  <text start="141.61" dur="5.97">dark some are saying that cue is locked</text>
  <text start="143.95" dur="6.15">out of the account saying that cue just</text>
  <text start="147.58" dur="7.23">disappeared is never coming back but</text>
  <text start="150.1" dur="8.46">there is a specific reason why cue had</text>
  <text start="154.81" dur="5.46">to go dark it&amp;#39;s not because oh let me go</text>
  <text start="158.56" dur="4.32">dark right now because I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="160.27" dur="6.69">speak there&amp;#39;s a specific reason actually</text>
  <text start="162.88" dur="5.43">there&amp;#39;s a law and this is why cue had to</text>
  <text start="166.96" dur="3.03">go dark and we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about</text>
  <text start="168.31" dur="3.96">that a little bit later but let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="169.99" dur="4.95">through what the deep state has been</text>
  <text start="172.27" dur="5.4">doing what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do and</text>
  <text start="174.94" dur="5.79">how Trump the Patriots how they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="177.67" dur="6.48">countering all of this because out of</text>
  <text start="180.73" dur="7.68">all of this you&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="184.15" dur="6.9">entire country go from dark to light it</text>
  <text start="188.41" dur="7.11">will give way to light and the American</text>
  <text start="191.05" dur="6.33">people will learn the truth now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.52" dur="6.96">very interesting we know the mainstream</text>
  <text start="197.38" dur="7.829">media they like to push out fake news</text>
  <text start="202.48" dur="4.44">now there&amp;#39;s different forms of it but a</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="4.651">lot of times what they like to do is</text>
  <text start="206.92" dur="6">they like to withhold news or not report</text>
  <text start="209.86" dur="4.95">on news and this way they can say oh we</text>
  <text start="212.92" dur="5.94">never said that we just didn&amp;#39;t report on</text>
  <text start="214.81" dur="5.97">it but if you have a news story that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.86" dur="4.74">out there and you&amp;#39;ve been telling other</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="4.59">stories and this counters a story that</text>
  <text start="223.6" dur="3.48">you&amp;#39;ve been putting out there you should</text>
  <text start="225.37" dur="6.96">put it out there</text>
  <text start="227.08" dur="7.77">so NBC News they deliberately hit vital</text>
  <text start="232.33" dur="5.61">information that would have helped clear</text>
  <text start="234.85" dur="5.58">Brett Kavanaugh of the serial rape</text>
  <text start="237.94" dur="3.51">allegations by Julie sweat Nick and her</text>
  <text start="240.43" dur="4.71">attorney Michael</text>
  <text start="241.45" dur="6.93">vanetti so on September 30th a week</text>
  <text start="245.14" dur="5.42">prior to Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s confirmation during</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="4.41">the most intense days of this scandal</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="6.52">Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s confirmation was still very</text>
  <text start="252.79" dur="5.94">much in doubt and NBC didn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="257.08" dur="5.55">public to know something very specific</text>
  <text start="258.73" dur="4.2">if you recall although he withheld a</text>
  <text start="262.63" dur="3.06">name</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="5.1">Aven Annie tweeted out a sworn statement</text>
  <text start="265.69" dur="4.95">from a woman who backed up sweat Nick&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.03" dur="4.89">are outrageous rape allegations in her</text>
  <text start="270.64" dur="4.83">statement the second woman swore that</text>
  <text start="272.92" dur="5.52">she too had witnessed Kavanagh spiked</text>
  <text start="275.47" dur="7.86">punch balls and take sexual advantage of</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="6.75">girls well unbeknownst to us NBC</text>
  <text start="283.33" dur="5.94">interviewed this anonymous witness on</text>
  <text start="285.19" dur="7.02">September 30th and she recanted but only</text>
  <text start="289.27" dur="6.24">now is NBC News bothering to report this</text>
  <text start="292.21" dur="6.27">bombshell so let me read what this woman</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="6.06">has said here referring to Kavanaugh</text>
  <text start="298.48" dur="4.74">spiking the punch I didn&amp;#39;t ever think it</text>
  <text start="301.57" dur="3.42">was Bret the woman said to reporters in</text>
  <text start="303.22" dur="3.99">a phone interview arranged by a vanetti</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="3.96">on September 30th after repeated</text>
  <text start="307.21" dur="3.54">requests to speak with other witnesses</text>
  <text start="308.95" dur="4.38">who might cooperate sweatin exclaims</text>
  <text start="310.75" dur="4.169">when asked in the phone interview if she</text>
  <text start="313.33" dur="4.11">ever witnessed Kavanaugh act</text>
  <text start="314.919" dur="7.141">inappropriately towards girls the woman</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="7.83">replied no but he gets worse on October</text>
  <text start="322.06" dur="6.12">3rd NBC News again spoke to this woman</text>
  <text start="325.27" dur="7.28">and this time she all but accused a</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="7.91">vanetti of fabricating her statement</text>
  <text start="332.55" dur="6.24">and they sat on this they should have</text>
  <text start="336.09" dur="6.54">come out with this information but they</text>
  <text start="338.79" dur="7.2">didn&amp;#39;t want to we see Sarah Carter put</text>
  <text start="342.63" dur="5.18">up an article about Papadopoulos saying</text>
  <text start="345.99" dur="5.49">that the FBI withheld exculpatory</text>
  <text start="347.81" dur="5.47">information from the secret court now</text>
  <text start="351.48" dur="4.77">former Trump campaign adviser George</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="4.65">papadopolis may hold the key to some of</text>
  <text start="356.25" dur="3.66">the most important questions lawmakers</text>
  <text start="357.93" dur="4.17">have been asking in recent months about</text>
  <text start="359.91" dur="4.95">the FBI&amp;#39;s handling of the Russian probe</text>
  <text start="362.1" dur="5.76">into Trump&amp;#39;s campaign did the FBI</text>
  <text start="364.86" dur="5.16">withhold exculpatory evidence from</text>
  <text start="367.86" dur="7.29">America&amp;#39;s most secret Court and if so</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="7.56">what was it so Mark meadows said the</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="4.44">following George papadopolis was the</text>
  <text start="377.58" dur="4.61">reason why this whole Russia</text>
  <text start="379.59" dur="5.73">investigation was opened</text>
  <text start="382.19" dur="5.47">hopefully he said we will learn today</text>
  <text start="385.32" dur="5.31">what was said and what was not said I</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="6.57">think what we&amp;#39;ll find is that this was</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="5.28">not colluding with Russia Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="394.23" dur="3.9">said that he made it perfectly clear to</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="5.01">the undercover Bureau operative and</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="5.19">british-based professor Stephan halper</text>
  <text start="400.92" dur="5.649">that there was no collusion between the</text>
  <text start="403.32" dur="6.17">Trump campaign and Russia</text>
  <text start="406.569" dur="6.1">so mark Meadows tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="409.49" dur="5.399">following George papadopolis the</text>
  <text start="412.669" dur="4.261">supposed key informant told the FBI</text>
  <text start="414.889" dur="4.761">there was no collusion before the FISA</text>
  <text start="416.93" dur="5.31">warrant and the FBI omitted that</text>
  <text start="419.65" dur="5.44">exculpatory information from the</text>
  <text start="422.24" dur="5.73">application anyway with all we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="425.09" dur="7.579">learned about FISA abuses this is deeply</text>
  <text start="427.97" dur="6.75">troubling mark meadow said so Halper who</text>
  <text start="432.669" dur="3.571">Papadopoulos suspected in late summer of</text>
  <text start="434.72" dur="4.5">2016 to be recording this conversation</text>
  <text start="436.24" dur="5.26">had questioned him extensively in</text>
  <text start="439.22" dur="4.41">private conversation as to whether or</text>
  <text start="441.5" dur="4.44">not the Trump campaign had been in</text>
  <text start="443.63" dur="4.159">communication with Russia he also</text>
  <text start="445.94" dur="3.949">questioned whether there was any</text>
  <text start="447.789" dur="4.241">coordination between Russia and the</text>
  <text start="449.889" dur="3.971">campaign to obtain Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="452.03" dur="6.06">emails that have been hacked from her</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="6.54">server Papadopoulos said I think I told</text>
  <text start="458.09" dur="4.47">him something along the lines of I have</text>
  <text start="460.4" dur="4.59">no idea what the hell you are talking</text>
  <text start="462.56" dur="6.27">about what you are talking about is</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="7.5">treason and I have nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="5.1">that so stop bothering me about it now</text>
  <text start="472.49" dur="4.049">the exchange between halper and</text>
  <text start="473.93" dur="4.35">Papadopoulos is important because it was</text>
  <text start="476.539" dur="4.171">this information that was obtained by</text>
  <text start="478.28" dur="3.689">the FBI that was purposefully kept from</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="3.78">the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance</text>
  <text start="481.969" dur="4.35">Court when the FBI and department judges</text>
  <text start="484.49" dur="4.829">sought a warrant to gather all the</text>
  <text start="486.319" dur="5.791">communications and spy on another former</text>
  <text start="489.319" dur="5.761">Trump campaign advisor quarter-page this</text>
  <text start="492.11" dur="5.22">is the exculpatory information that the</text>
  <text start="495.08" dur="5.699">government has fought so hard to keep</text>
  <text start="497.33" dur="5.22">from the public this is what they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="500.779" dur="4.44">want people to know because if this was</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="4.919">known then this FISA warrant should have</text>
  <text start="505.219" dur="4.56">never been issued and the spying should</text>
  <text start="507.469" dur="5.49">have never happened and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="509.779" dur="4.531">anyone to know this but it&amp;#39;s all coming</text>
  <text start="512.959" dur="3.601">out</text>
  <text start="514.31" dur="4.529">let&amp;#39;s get into what is happening with</text>
  <text start="516.56" dur="4.469">this bomber and these packages that are</text>
  <text start="518.839" dur="4.56">being sent all over the place right now</text>
  <text start="521.029" dur="6.54">two more suspicious packages were</text>
  <text start="523.399" dur="7.771">discovered today and they found this and</text>
  <text start="527.569" dur="7.231">this was sent to Cory Booker very</text>
  <text start="531.17" dur="6.389">interesting in the Camden office but was</text>
  <text start="534.8" dur="5.37">intercepted in Florida very interesting</text>
  <text start="537.559" dur="4.291">a 12 package meanwhile was addressed to</text>
  <text start="540.17" dur="3.99">both CNN and former Director of National</text>
  <text start="541.85" dur="5.88">Intelligence turned activist CNN</text>
  <text start="544.16" dur="5.909">commentator James clapper now police</text>
  <text start="547.73" dur="3.719">evacuated the Manhattan post office in</text>
  <text start="550.069" dur="3.93">response to all this</text>
  <text start="551.449" dur="4.471">clapper called the packages domestic</text>
  <text start="553.999" dur="3.931">terrorism remember clapper he lied to</text>
  <text start="555.92" dur="4.019">the American people telling everyone</text>
  <text start="557.93" dur="3.87">that you know they don&amp;#39;t spy on American</text>
  <text start="559.939" dur="5.88">people but once again when you look at</text>
  <text start="561.8" dur="7.17">the package no postmarks at all they</text>
  <text start="565.819" dur="7.32">didn&amp;#39;t invalidate the stamps very odd</text>
  <text start="568.97" dur="5.789">very strange now it&amp;#39;s all over the</text>
  <text start="573.139" dur="5.161">mainstream media I&amp;#39;m sure everyone heard</text>
  <text start="574.759" dur="6.75">it that they arrested the man who sent</text>
  <text start="578.3" dur="7.229">the packages they identified him as</text>
  <text start="581.509" dur="6.33">Cesar seoc jr. now it seems like this</text>
  <text start="585.529" dur="5.221">individual has many different names but</text>
  <text start="587.839" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;ll use Cesar his first name to</text>
  <text start="590.75" dur="5.97">identify him and social media posts</text>
  <text start="594.319" dur="4.83">reveal that seoc attended at least one</text>
  <text start="596.72" dur="4.739">Trump rally and they show a picture of</text>
  <text start="599.149" dur="5.88">him holding up a sign welcome President</text>
  <text start="601.459" dur="5.911">Trump now the man is 56 was arrested in</text>
  <text start="605.029" dur="4.86">Miami area after discovering DNA</text>
  <text start="607.37" dur="4.829">evidence that led them to a packaging</text>
  <text start="609.889" dur="4.67">center which then led them to the</text>
  <text start="612.199" dur="5.041">plantation Auto Zone in Broward County</text>
  <text start="614.559" dur="5.441">miles away from the sunrise florida</text>
  <text start="617.24" dur="5.279">office of congresswoman debbie Wasserman</text>
  <text start="620" dur="5.009">Schultz and that is the return address</text>
  <text start="622.519" dur="4.771">that&amp;#39;s on the package but we need to</text>
  <text start="625.009" dur="4.95">remember the bomb had the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="627.29" dur="5.07">flag on it and so far we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="629.959" dur="2.79">Caesar being associated with the Islamic</text>
  <text start="632.36" dur="2.909">state</text>
  <text start="632.749" dur="4.71">he never tweeted out anything about the</text>
  <text start="635.269" dur="3.841">Islamic state and it&amp;#39;s strange that this</text>
  <text start="637.459" dur="4.441">individual would put this on there</text>
  <text start="639.11" dur="6.12">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense at all</text>
  <text start="641.9" dur="7.05">they found his van in a parking lot so</text>
  <text start="645.23" dur="7.92">let&amp;#39;s go and look at who he sent this to</text>
  <text start="648.95" dur="8.13">he sent it to Obama Clinton Biden CNN</text>
  <text start="653.15" dur="7.439">Brennan Holder Wasserman Schultz waters</text>
  <text start="657.08" dur="5.58">clapper Booker Soros De Niro and all</text>
  <text start="660.589" dur="3.391">these people that are in government</text>
  <text start="662.66" dur="3.119">they&amp;#39;re the ones who are under</text>
  <text start="663.98" dur="4.95">investigation and then we have the</text>
  <text start="665.779" dur="7.621">others that either pay for certain</text>
  <text start="668.93" dur="7.46">events maybe with refugees and then we</text>
  <text start="673.4" dur="7.32">have others who are outspoken critics of</text>
  <text start="676.39" dur="5.92">Trump so those are where all the</text>
  <text start="680.72" dur="4.89">packages have gone now</text>
  <text start="682.31" dur="5.85">the bombers van and this is very</text>
  <text start="685.61" dur="4.38">interesting the stickers are not really</text>
  <text start="688.16" dur="3.15">sick errs they are large print stickers</text>
  <text start="689.99" dur="3.69">that were put together with slight</text>
  <text start="691.31" dur="4.2">photoshop and then it looks like it was</text>

  <text start="711.08" dur="7.83">closer to the images they show memes and</text>
  <text start="714.37" dur="7.21">many add-ins use these type of memes but</text>
  <text start="718.91" dur="6.54">again we&amp;#39;re not riding around with these</text>
  <text start="721.58" dur="5.94">memes on our cars this is not how Trump</text>

  <text start="741.56" dur="5.469">negative we look at the positive</text>
  <text start="745.11" dur="3.96">and this is very strange that this</text>
  <text start="747.029" dur="3.451">individual would put all this out there</text>
  <text start="749.07" dur="3.81">so on his van he has all these stickers</text>

  <text start="755.49" dur="5.25">dashboard I mean they went all out on</text>
  <text start="757.589" dur="6.511">this one so when we look at the</text>
  <text start="760.74" dur="6.39">individuals Twitter feed most of the</text>
  <text start="764.1" dur="5.25">posts are very strange their memes and a</text>
  <text start="767.13" dur="6.48">lot of it is just repeated over and over</text>
  <text start="769.35" dur="6.239">and over and over and it seems that this</text>
  <text start="773.61" dur="5.07">individual has different Twitter</text>
  <text start="775.589" dur="4.771">accounts but they show the same tweets</text>

  <text start="780.36" dur="4.38">doesn&amp;#39;t really write that much on it and</text>
  <text start="782.64" dur="4.379">they just keep putting it out there over</text>
  <text start="784.74" dur="4.14">and over and over and the one part where</text>
  <text start="787.019" dur="4.201">they show the person wrote something</text>
  <text start="788.88" dur="5.31">Caesar wrote something it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>

  <text start="794.19" dur="4.95">individual has a mental illness maybe he</text>
  <text start="797.25" dur="4.89">has a problem we don&amp;#39;t know as of yet</text>
  <text start="799.14" dur="6.87">but let&amp;#39;s go back to the van The Daily</text>

  <text start="817.589" dur="4.291">strange and he had these new sticker not</text>

  <text start="821.88" dur="5.519">you know gigantic sticker placed on the</text>
  <text start="824.85" dur="5.91">car and it doesn&amp;#39;t look like this was on</text>

  <text start="870.089" dur="4.321">would see sun fade so that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="872.459" dur="7.111">strange right off the bat</text>
  <text start="874.41" dur="6.99">so let&amp;#39;s talk about Caesar here the</text>
  <text start="879.57" dur="3.93">mainstream media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="881.4" dur="3.39">that Caesar is a registered Republican</text>

  <text start="884.79" dur="5.7">kind of predicted it that this was a</text>
  <text start="887.61" dur="6.18">complete and utter setup and we knew the</text>
  <text start="890.49" dur="5.46">plan and again if you take a look at his</text>
  <text start="893.79" dur="4.95">Twitter feed on one of his Twitter</text>
  <text start="895.95" dur="4.11">accounts he&amp;#39;s not following Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="898.74" dur="3.75">not following anyone he&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="900.06" dur="4.86">following Democrats which is kind of</text>
  <text start="902.49" dur="7.05">strange he&amp;#39;s following people like Jimmy</text>

  <text start="921.21" dur="6.33">seems like he is following Trump so this</text>
  <text start="925.47" dur="4.05">individual goes under you know different</text>
  <text start="927.54" dur="5.85">names here so this is kind of strange he</text>

  <text start="944.97" dur="4.32">that are associated with this name so it</text>
  <text start="947.04" dur="5.4">looks like the Twitter accounts just</text>
