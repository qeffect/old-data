  <text start="211.049" dur="5.371">not everyone at the same exact time and</text>
  <text start="213.269" dur="5.97">we can see this and go back to 2008 not</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="4.939">everyone was caught up in the 2008</text>
  <text start="219.239" dur="4.2">recession some people made out very well</text>

  <text start="238.889" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a complete and</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="4.259">utter breakdown if we look at Auto Sales</text>

  <text start="259.5" dur="5.97">thousand vehicles or 1.8 percent and</text>
  <text start="262.49" dur="4.87">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that this was the</text>
  <text start="265.47" dur="5.43">first overall decline since the</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="6.239">financial crisis now compared to 2015</text>

  <text start="292.289" dur="5.22">that the automobile industry it&amp;#39;s taking</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="5.43">its hit right now and when we really</text>
  <text start="297.509" dur="5.25">look at it what is going on well we have</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="4.5">a lot of soaring defaults on subprime</text>
  <text start="302.759" dur="3.601">auto loans that means there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="304.68" dur="3.239">people that just aren&amp;#39;t going out buying</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="4.35">the cars the ones that have purchased</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="4.74">the cars guess what they&amp;#39;re defaulting</text>
  <text start="310.71" dur="4.11">on their loans they&amp;#39;ve went all the way</text>
  <text start="312.659" dur="4.111">to the bottom trying to get subprime</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="4.17">people in to take these loans they got</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="3.78">the loans and now they&amp;#39;re defaulting on</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="4.71">them we see</text>
  <text start="320.55" dur="5.58">negative equity in trade ins as a result</text>
  <text start="323.7" dur="5.76">of years of lengthening loan terms and</text>
  <text start="326.13" dur="6.56">rolling everything over and it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="6.45">sustained this way it just doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="332.69" dur="4.15">and going into 2018 it&amp;#39;s just gonna get</text>
  <text start="335.91" dur="4.08">worse because it&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot of</text>
  <text start="336.84" dur="5.28">more people losing their jobs more</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="3.6">retail stores are gonna close more</text>
  <text start="342.12" dur="3.15">corporations and remember these</text>
  <text start="343.59" dur="3.87">corporations they have a maken they</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="4.59">haven&amp;#39;t been making profits sales</text>
  <text start="347.46" dur="4.79">they&amp;#39;ve been buying back their stocks</text>
  <text start="349.86" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ve been taking out cheap money</text>
  <text start="352.25" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;ve been shutting different</text>
  <text start="354.78" dur="4.11">locations down to make their earnings</text>
  <text start="357.54" dur="5.64">look good which are completely different</text>
  <text start="358.89" dur="6.3">then revenue and sales we see the</text>
  <text start="363.18" dur="4.77">brick-and-mortar meltdown is now</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="5.39">reaching movie theaters so we&amp;#39;ve have</text>
  <text start="367.95" dur="5.12">the retail industry with stores</text>
  <text start="370.58" dur="5.68">brick-and-mortar stores we have</text>
  <text start="373.07" dur="6.76">restaurants traffic is declining sales</text>
  <text start="376.26" dur="6.26">and restaurants are declining automobile</text>
  <text start="379.83" dur="6.63">industry is declining now it&amp;#39;s hitting</text>
  <text start="382.52" dur="5.71">movie theaters and when you look at this</text>
  <text start="386.46" dur="4.56">you say well wait a minute how could it</text>
  <text start="388.23" dur="6.87">be movie theaters I mean the last Jedi</text>
  <text start="391.02" dur="8.49">just came out I made 517 million well if</text>
  <text start="395.1" dur="9.32">we go back in time we see the Star Wars</text>
  <text start="399.51" dur="8.13">movie the force has awakened that made</text>
  <text start="404.42" dur="6.91">900 something million dollars now yes</text>
  <text start="407.64" dur="6.84">the last Jedi has longer to go but at</text>
  <text start="411.33" dur="6">the same time period the other movie</text>
  <text start="414.48" dur="7.23">made a lot more money and if we look at</text>
  <text start="417.33" dur="7.14">this we can see that ticket sales are</text>
  <text start="421.71" dur="5.67">going down less people are going to the</text>
  <text start="424.47" dur="4.56">theaters prices of tickets are moving up</text>
  <text start="427.38" dur="2.97">and yes this could kick a lot of people</text>
  <text start="429.03" dur="4.08">out saying you know I&amp;#39;m not gonna pay</text>
  <text start="430.35" dur="6">that high price and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="433.11" dur="6.6">right now is that it&amp;#39;s starting to hit</text>
  <text start="436.35" dur="5.16">the entertainment industry the number of</text>
  <text start="439.71" dur="5.07">actual tickets sold in the u.s. movie</text>
  <text start="441.51" dur="6.98">theaters in 2017 fell by 3.6 percent</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="7.04">year-over-year now this is according to</text>
  <text start="448.49" dur="5.59">the numbers this is a site that</text>
  <text start="451.82" dur="2.69">calculates all this and collects all the</text>
  <text start="454.08" dur="3.52">data</text>
  <text start="454.51" dur="5.49">and what we&amp;#39;re looking at right now is</text>
  <text start="457.6" dur="6.48">that the peak</text>
  <text start="460" dur="9.84">ticket sales they are down 21 percent</text>
  <text start="464.08" dur="8.16">since 2002 this tells us that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="469.84" dur="5.4">seeing a decline since that period of</text>
  <text start="472.24" dur="5.46">time and it&amp;#39;s accelerating and as the</text>
  <text start="475.24" dur="6.05">price of tickets move up less people can</text>
  <text start="477.7" dur="6.3">afford it as the price of food out in</text>
  <text start="481.29" dur="4.47">restaurants moves up less people can</text>
  <text start="484" dur="4.59">afford it as people lose their jobs</text>
  <text start="485.76" dur="5.2">people don&amp;#39;t go out to the movies people</text>
  <text start="488.59" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t go out to dinner and this is</text>
  <text start="490.96" dur="4.29">exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="493.03" dur="6.45">movie theaters have been trying to</text>
  <text start="495.25" dur="6.39">combat this by redoing their theaters</text>
  <text start="499.48" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re putting in recliner chairs wider</text>
  <text start="501.64" dur="4.25">chairs making it feel like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="502.96" dur="6.21">watching the movie in your living room</text>
  <text start="505.89" dur="5.41">but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to work right now it</text>
  <text start="509.17" dur="3.72">looks like a lot of people are saying</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="2.7">you know what I&amp;#39;m opting out right now</text>
  <text start="512.89" dur="3">I&amp;#39;m not going to be going to the</text>
  <text start="514" dur="4.229">theaters and what&amp;#39;s even more</text>
  <text start="515.89" dur="4.29">interesting is that the major production</text>
  <text start="518.229" dur="5.041">houses like Warner Brothers Walt Disney</text>
  <text start="520.18" dur="5.22">Paramount Pictures Sony&amp;#39;s Sony Pictures</text>
  <text start="523.27" dur="4.92">and Universal they noticed this and</text>
  <text start="525.4" dur="5.34">there&amp;#39;s been a downward trend since the</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="6.63">recession where they&amp;#39;re releasing less</text>
  <text start="530.74" dur="10.23">and less movies in 2017 they released</text>
  <text start="534.82" dur="8.43">just 79 movies down 38% since 2006 so</text>
  <text start="540.97" dur="5.04">what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is a</text>
  <text start="543.25" dur="5.58">deterioration in different sectors right</text>
  <text start="546.01" dur="6.08">now and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s coming out into the</text>
  <text start="548.83" dur="6.21">open showing that there are problems and</text>
  <text start="552.09" dur="6.97">we can see right now that this is going</text>
  <text start="555.04" dur="6.69">to continue and remember most of these</text>
  <text start="559.06" dur="4.5">theaters are near malls or inside of</text>
  <text start="561.73" dur="3.87">moles and we know that the traffic in</text>
  <text start="563.56" dur="4.29">malls have been drying up and if these</text>
  <text start="565.6" dur="4.41">theaters if they start to close down</text>
  <text start="567.85" dur="4.14">because they&amp;#39;re not getting the ticket</text>
  <text start="570.01" dur="3.69">sales and they can&amp;#39;t make a profit it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.99" dur="2.94">going to affect the malls and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="573.7" dur="3.45">to be a domino effect and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="574.93" dur="4.82">be absolutely terrible we see the</text>
  <text start="577.15" dur="5.85">services PMI syncs to six months lows as</text>
  <text start="579.75" dur="4.81">confidence tumbles we also see the</text>
  <text start="583" dur="3.3">housing markets not just here in the</text>
  <text start="584.56" dur="3.99">United States and Canada but we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="586.3" dur="3.96">seeing the housing markets</text>
  <text start="588.55" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re beginning to crack in Australia</text>
  <text start="590.26" dur="6">New Zealand London now property values</text>
  <text start="593.53" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re all starting to crash Australia</text>
  <text start="596.26" dur="4.77">home prices fell in the final three</text>
  <text start="598.45" dur="4.41">months of 2017 we&amp;#39;re also seeing it in</text>
  <text start="601.03" dur="5.22">New Zealand we&amp;#39;re seeing it in London</text>
  <text start="602.86" dur="5.64">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="606.25" dur="5.13">the whole thing is starting to</text>
  <text start="608.5" dur="4.95">completely fall apart now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="611.38" dur="4.85">interesting is that a lot of these homes</text>
  <text start="613.45" dur="4.89">were purchased by foreign buyers and</text>
  <text start="616.23" dur="3.67">that is starting to drive back</text>
  <text start="618.34" dur="4.8">especially the Chinese because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="619.9" dur="5.79">starting to redirect their investments</text>
  <text start="623.14" dur="4.83">back into their own country into the</text>
  <text start="625.69" dur="7.11">belt and Road and away from real estate</text>
  <text start="627.97" dur="7.11">and remember the everyday person is not</text>
  <text start="632.8" dur="3.57">out there purchasing these homes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="635.08" dur="4.53">not going out taking a mortgage because</text>
  <text start="636.37" dur="5.46">a lot of these people they are barely</text>
  <text start="639.61" dur="4.38">hanging on many people can&amp;#39;t find a high</text>
  <text start="641.83" dur="4.44">paying job many people can&amp;#39;t find jobs</text>
  <text start="643.99" dur="4.25">at all and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="646.27" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s completely falling apart and</text>
  <text start="648.24" dur="5.89">whenever a housing starts to decline</text>

  <text start="663.16" dur="4.26">deteriorating it&amp;#39;s spreading to all</text>
  <text start="665.65" dur="4.29">different sectors it&amp;#39;s spreading to</text>

  <text start="669.94" dur="5.97">this happen all at once now at the same</text>
  <text start="673.48" dur="4.26">time that this is happening we see and</text>
  <text start="675.91" dur="5.01">as we know we discussed this before the</text>

  <text start="680.92" dur="4.59">it was going to go live after Christmas</text>
  <text start="683.08" dur="5.58">and it looks like it is slated to go</text>
  <text start="685.51" dur="6.18">live on January 18th that&amp;#39;s when they</text>
  <text start="688.66" dur="5.31">expect to start this and the Shanghai</text>
  <text start="691.69" dur="4.7">International Energy exchange a unit of</text>

  <text start="704.47" dur="4.32">first for China&amp;#39;s commodities market</text>
  <text start="706.81" dur="5.73">because the exchange is registered in</text>

  <text start="712.54" dur="6.21">said the trading is going to start</text>
  <text start="714.61" dur="7.38">January 18th why is this important for</text>
  <text start="718.75" dur="5.82">China because Futures Trading would</text>
  <text start="721.99" dur="5.13">some control over pricing from the main</text>
  <text start="724.57" dur="5.94">international benchmarks which are based</text>
  <text start="727.12" dur="5.909">on dollars denominating oil contracts in</text>

  <text start="735.25" dur="5.13">country&amp;#39;s key long-term goals and China</text>
  <text start="737.89" dur="4.259">would benefit from having a benchmark</text>
  <text start="740.38" dur="3.81">that reflects the grades of oil that are</text>
  <text start="742.149" dur="4.921">mostly consumed by local refineries and</text>
  <text start="744.19" dur="6.93">differ from those underpinning Western</text>
  <text start="747.07" dur="6.57">contracts how do you choose work well</text>
  <text start="751.12" dur="5.37">future contracts fixed prices today for</text>
  <text start="753.64" dur="4.8">delivery at a later date consumers use</text>
  <text start="756.49" dur="4.77">them to protect against higher prices</text>
  <text start="758.44" dur="5.91">down the line speculators use them to</text>
  <text start="761.26" dur="5.31">bet on where prices are headed in 2017</text>
  <text start="764.35" dur="5.31">oil futures contracts in new york and</text>
  <text start="766.57" dur="6.15">london outstripped physical trading by a</text>
  <text start="769.66" dur="6.39">factor of 23 crude oil is among the most</text>
  <text start="772.72" dur="7.59">actively traded commodities with two</text>
  <text start="776.05" dur="6.06">benchmarks West Texas Intermediate or WT</text>

  <text start="787.06" dur="3.6">London</text>
  <text start="787.72" dur="5.91">why didn&amp;#39;t China begin training futures</text>
  <text start="790.66" dur="5.82">until now well lower crude prices have</text>
  <text start="793.63" dur="6.3">played a part Chinese all Chinese oil</text>
  <text start="796.48" dur="6.21">futures well they were proposed in 2012</text>
  <text start="799.93" dur="5.43">following spikes above $100 a barrel but</text>
  <text start="802.69" dur="4.32">prices in 2017 have averaged little more</text>
  <text start="805.36" dur="4.11">than $50 a barrel</text>
  <text start="807.01" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s also concern over volatility</text>
  <text start="809.47" dur="5.34">trying to introduce domestic crude</text>
  <text start="811.24" dur="6">futures in 1993 only to stop a year</text>
  <text start="814.81" dur="4.11">later because of volatility and it looks</text>
  <text start="817.24" dur="4.2">like they worked out all the problems</text>
  <text start="818.92" dur="6.3">and this has been in the works for some</text>
  <text start="821.44" dur="6.99">time could the yuan challenge the</text>
  <text start="825.22" dur="5.369">dollars dominance and oil yes it could</text>
  <text start="828.43" dur="4.44">but it could take a couple of years</text>
  <text start="830.589" dur="4.56">since most of the world right now trades</text>
  <text start="832.87" dur="4.709">oil using the dollars but it would</text>
  <text start="835.149" dur="4.68">happen slowly and this is what the</text>
  <text start="837.579" dur="4.32">central bankers like they like things to</text>
  <text start="839.829" dur="5.7">happen slowly so you don&amp;#39;t notice it</text>
  <text start="841.899" dur="6.211">and remember China is creating the</text>
  <text start="845.529" dur="5.971">belton road so on the other hand paying</text>
  <text start="848.11" dur="6.21">you wan for oil could become part of the</text>
  <text start="851.5" dur="4.88">one belt one road initiative and this</text>
  <text start="854.32" dur="5.09">would develop ties across your a</text>
  <text start="856.38" dur="7.16">Middle East it would allow the Chinese</text>
  <text start="859.41" dur="7.17">to participate in soundies Aramco&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="863.54" dur="5.95">planned initial public offerings they</text>
  <text start="866.58" dur="6.3">could help the Saudi opinion toward</text>
  <text start="869.49" dur="7.38">accepting the yuan so we can see that</text>
  <text start="872.88" dur="7.32">this is going to go up against the petro</text>
  <text start="876.87" dur="6.33">dollar what&amp;#39;s certain is that the BRICS</text>
  <text start="880.2" dur="8.19">supported the petro yuan move at their</text>
  <text start="883.2" dur="7.079">summit in Jia men and we see that many</text>
  <text start="888.39" dur="5.85">other countries like Russia Venezuela</text>
  <text start="890.279" dur="7.231">and many others are considering using</text>
  <text start="894.24" dur="5.64">the petrol yuyuan so we can see that</text>
  <text start="897.51" dur="4.56">with the economy completely falling</text>
  <text start="899.88" dur="4.68">apart with countries moving away from</text>
  <text start="902.07" dur="4.41">the petro dollar and it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="904.56" dur="4.8">happen like tomorrow but it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="906.48" dur="5.37">happen slowly with a one belt one Road</text>
  <text start="909.36" dur="5.19">initiative time all these different</text>
  <text start="911.85" dur="5.04">areas together having the Petra you want</text>
  <text start="914.55" dur="5.49">have in the futures market we can see</text>
  <text start="916.89" dur="7.17">how this is being set up and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="920.04" dur="6.18">to be used to move everything away from</text>
  <text start="924.06" dur="4.2">the West now remember everything that</text>
  <text start="926.22" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ve been doing has been done over</text>
  <text start="928.26" dur="3.93">time it&amp;#39;s not like yesterday they flew</text>
  <text start="930.51" dur="3.81">they they flipped a switch and</text>
  <text start="932.19" dur="3.51">everything just moved everything has</text>
  <text start="934.32" dur="3.18">been planned for quite a while the</text>
  <text start="935.7" dur="4.079">central bankers they do this very</text>
  <text start="937.5" dur="4.05">methodically they take their time and</text>
  <text start="939.779" dur="3.541">make sure that no one really notices it</text>
  <text start="941.55" dur="3.779">and the corporate media that there</text>
  <text start="943.32" dur="4.829">they&amp;#39;re not looking at this at all and</text>
  <text start="945.329" dur="5.401">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="948.149" dur="4.291">getting ready and prepared to make the</text>
  <text start="950.73" dur="3.39">switch over to the new system what they</text>
  <text start="952.44" dur="3.959">really wanted was some type of</text>
  <text start="954.12" dur="4.56">distraction to distract the world for</text>
  <text start="956.399" dur="4.261">another couple of years so this way they</text>
  <text start="958.68" dur="4.68">can switch everything and when</text>
  <text start="960.66" dur="4.32">everything comes back and the</text>
  <text start="963.36" dur="3.51">distraction is over like war whatever</text>
  <text start="964.98" dur="3.51">they can say listen we need to go to a</text>
  <text start="966.87" dur="4.469">different system we need to go someplace</text>
  <text start="968.49" dur="4.89">where there&amp;#39;s manufacturing where&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="971.339" dur="5.461">there where there&amp;#39;s gold where the</text>
  <text start="973.38" dur="5.34">system can be maintained and sustained</text>
  <text start="976.8" dur="3.87">and we need to get away from the other</text>
  <text start="978.72" dur="4.5">system that&amp;#39;s what they really wanted to</text>
  <text start="980.67" dur="4.47">do but at this point right now they have</text>
  <text start="983.22" dur="4.32">been planning they&amp;#39;ve been prepping and</text>
  <text start="985.14" dur="3.47">we&amp;#39;re getting very close to that stage</text>
  <text start="987.54" dur="2.2">and when we go through this transition</text>
  <text start="988.61" dur="3.5">period</text>
  <text start="989.74" dur="4.23">well it&amp;#39;s going to take everything that</text>
