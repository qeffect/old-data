  <text start="406.02" dur="4.53">nervous and we can</text>
  <text start="408.449" dur="4.5">see why because as they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="410.55" dur="3.72">threatened with ballons they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="412.949" dur="3.09">you know something I don&amp;#39;t want to keep</text>
  <text start="414.27" dur="4.38">my money in the bank I wanted someplace</text>
  <text start="416.039" dur="4.321">else and I will only keep a little bit</text>

  <text start="420.36" dur="4.019">is exactly what everyone should be doing</text>
  <text start="422.099" dur="4.141">continually doing only keep enough in</text>
  <text start="424.379" dur="4.01">the bank to pay your bills keep your</text>
  <text start="426.24" dur="4.44">money in precious metals or other places</text>
  <text start="428.389" dur="4.24">don&amp;#39;t tell anyone where it is this is my</text>
  <text start="430.68" dur="3.539">personal opinion this is what I do and</text>
  <text start="432.629" dur="2.88">this is what I believe that everyone</text>
  <text start="434.219" dur="3.66">should be doing at this point because</text>
  <text start="435.509" dur="4.8">you never know when this is going to</text>
  <text start="437.879" dur="5.4">occur and you need gold and silver you</text>
  <text start="440.309" dur="7.35">also need cash on hand just in case now</text>
  <text start="443.279" dur="7.89">Obama was out there and he is being</text>
  <text start="447.659" dur="5.79">interviewed and he asserts wherever we</text>
  <text start="451.169" dur="4.68">have been involved over the last several</text>
  <text start="453.449" dur="5.19">years I think the outcome has been</text>
  <text start="455.849" dur="6.15">better because of American leadership we</text>
  <text start="458.639" dur="5.76">are hugely influential we&amp;#39;re the one</text>
  <text start="461.999" dur="4.59">indispensable nation but when it comes</text>
  <text start="464.399" dur="4.531">to nation-building when it comes to what</text>
  <text start="466.589" dur="7.13">is going to be a generational project in</text>
  <text start="468.93" dur="8.819">place like Libya Syria Iraq Yemen</text>
  <text start="473.719" dur="6.491">Lebanon we can&amp;#39;t help but we can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="477.749" dur="4.2">for them in other words the Libyan</text>
  <text start="480.21" dur="3.749">people failed and the Syrian people</text>
  <text start="481.949" dur="4.02">failed and the Iraqi people failed</text>
  <text start="483.959" dur="4.26">according to the American president now</text>
  <text start="485.969" dur="3.72">think about what he&amp;#39;s saying the United</text>
  <text start="488.219" dur="4.23">States government the central bankers</text>
  <text start="489.689" dur="5.01">went into these countries they overthrew</text>
  <text start="492.449" dur="4.26">the elected government in these</text>
  <text start="494.699" dur="4.14">countries they replaced it with a puppet</text>
  <text start="496.709" dur="3.93">government this was not for the people</text>
  <text start="498.839" dur="5.82">this was for these central bankers</text>
  <text start="500.639" dur="5.911">because in Iraq in Lebanon and all these</text>
  <text start="504.659" dur="3.48">other countries they wanted to sell</text>
  <text start="506.55" dur="3">their oil not using the dollar they</text>
  <text start="508.139" dur="4.65">wanted to accept other currencies they</text>
  <text start="509.55" dur="5.46">wanted to accept gold or silver and they</text>
  <text start="512.789" dur="3.81">the central bankers could not let this</text>
  <text start="515.01" dur="3.42">happen so basically what happened is</text>
  <text start="516.599" dur="3.57">they went into all these countries and</text>
  <text start="518.43" dur="3.75">they overthrew them because they knew</text>
  <text start="520.169" dur="3.691">they needed to prop up this dollar for a</text>
  <text start="522.18" dur="3.99">longer period of time before the</text>
  <text start="523.86" dur="4.26">collapse occurred and we can see right</text>
  <text start="526.17" dur="4.76">now all the people now are fighting back</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="6.18">saying listen we never wanted this you</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="5.68">invaded our country replaced it with a</text>
  <text start="534.3" dur="4.62">government of your choosing set up a</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="4.95">central bank and you are continued our</text>
  <text start="538.92" dur="3.27">controlling us and now we want our</text>
  <text start="541.56" dur="2.55">countries</text>

  <text start="937.9" dur="3.87">because they don&amp;#39;t want them to destroy</text>
  <text start="939.82" dur="3.15">the Islamic state what they want to do</text>
  <text start="941.77" dur="3.39">is they want them</text>
  <text start="942.97" dur="4.5">to handle the uprising that is going on</text>
  <text start="945.16" dur="3.869">in Iraq and that is the people of Iraq</text>
  <text start="947.47" dur="6.39">and the same things happening in Lebanon</text>
  <text start="949.029" dur="6.391">Libya Yemen it is all same the people</text>
  <text start="953.86" dur="3.899">are sick and tired of the puppet</text>

  <text start="961.449" dur="8.58">to free servicemen held only if they</text>
  <text start="965.639" dur="7">meet their demands and basically their</text>
  <text start="970.029" dur="4.701">demand is they want their own state they</text>
  <text start="972.639" dur="4.981">want part of Syria and part of Iraq and</text>
  <text start="974.73" dur="4.779">that is their their demands this is</text>
  <text start="977.62" dur="4.29">coming from an unofficial source and</text>
  <text start="979.509" dur="4.5">again we can see already they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="981.91" dur="4.14">building up to go into Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="984.009" dur="5.041">using the propaganda to get troops into</text>
  <text start="986.05" dur="6.089">this area and as we can see right now</text>
  <text start="989.05" dur="5.399">the Islamic state forces are reported by</text>
  <text start="992.139" dur="5.01">Western military sources to be massing</text>
  <text start="994.449" dur="4.95">heavily in central and northern Syria</text>
  <text start="997.149" dur="6.12">especially south of Aleppo they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="999.399" dur="6.81">trying to retake the queres military</text>
  <text start="1003.269" dur="5.19">airbase once again and we have to really</text>
  <text start="1006.209" dur="5.55">look at what&amp;#39;s going on here they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1008.459" dur="7.201">been showing that they can down planes</text>
  <text start="1011.759" dur="6.75">of course are they really doing this who</text>
  <text start="1015.66" dur="4.71">knows but it&amp;#39;s propaganda to get the</text>
  <text start="1018.509" dur="3.75">no-fly zone to get the buffer zone now</text>
  <text start="1020.37" dur="4.079">they&amp;#39;re going after an airbase once</text>
  <text start="1022.259" dur="4.83">again they tried to do this once before</text>
  <text start="1024.449" dur="4.171">but the Syrian Armed Forces came in and</text>
  <text start="1027.089" dur="3.781">they push them out so they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1028.62" dur="4.98">once again and as soon as they capture</text>
  <text start="1030.87" dur="4.53">an air base and they keep it basically</text>
  <text start="1033.6" dur="6.51">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the United</text>
  <text start="1035.4" dur="6.45">States Israel UK and all the Arab forces</text>
  <text start="1040.11" dur="4.229">the coalition are going to say listen we</text>
  <text start="1041.85" dur="3.989">need to lock down this area we need a</text>
  <text start="1044.339" dur="4.531">no-fly zone we need a buffer zone</text>
  <text start="1045.839" dur="5.22">because they do have the ability to fly</text>
  <text start="1048.87" dur="4.62">planes to shoot down planes and we can</text>
  <text start="1051.059" dur="5.401">see this is definitely building up right</text>
  <text start="1053.49" dur="5.939">now now we understand the FBI was</text>
  <text start="1056.46" dur="4.5">completely wrong about the Sony hacking</text>
  <text start="1059.429" dur="3.48">it did not come from North Korea</text>
  <text start="1060.96" dur="4.26">whatsoever and there are more</text>

  <text start="1065.22" dur="4.17">them you know something you&amp;#39;re way off</text>
  <text start="1066.929" dur="4.23">base with this and it had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="1069.39" dur="3">in North Korea basically what that</text>
  <text start="1071.159" dur="2.941">happens is the government just</text>
  <text start="1072.39" dur="3.63">continually lies to the people they</text>
  <text start="1074.1" dur="2.7">never admit that they&amp;#39;re lying they put</text>
  <text start="1076.02" dur="2.37">it out there in the New</text>
  <text start="1076.8" dur="3.69">used to make everyone convinced that it</text>
  <text start="1078.39" dur="4.05">was new North Korea to demonize North</text>
  <text start="1080.49" dur="3.6">Korea because again the players are</text>
  <text start="1082.44" dur="3.33">always the same this is where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1084.09" dur="6.47">going to be going to war with North</text>
  <text start="1085.77" dur="8.73">Korea Iran Syria China Russia and others</text>
  <text start="1090.56" dur="6.19">but the FBI is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1094.5" dur="3.75">saying the cyber terrorists who hacked</text>
  <text start="1096.75" dur="3.15">Sony Pictures and now they&amp;#39;re not saying</text>
  <text start="1098.25" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s North Korea they&amp;#39;re just saying the</text>
  <text start="1099.9" dur="3.09">cyber terrorists because they know it</text>
  <text start="1101.67" dur="4.08">was an inside job they know it was a</text>
  <text start="1102.99" dur="5.73">disgruntled employee and there&amp;#39;s was</text>
  <text start="1105.75" dur="5.22">part of a different group they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1108.72" dur="4.44">that they have threatened to attack in</text>
  <text start="1110.97" dur="4.47">American news media organization and</text>
  <text start="1113.16" dur="4.32">this is coming out in the FBI bulletin</text>

  <text start="1117.48" dur="3.87">organization by the guardians of peace</text>
  <text start="1119.1" dur="4.23">the hacker group that has claimed credit</text>
  <text start="1121.35" dur="3.84">for the sony attack makes then two other</text>
  <text start="1123.33" dur="3.96">such organizations in the near future</text>
  <text start="1125.19" dur="6.99">and they&amp;#39;re getting prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="1127.29" dur="6.66">for this now they want that movie which</text>
  <text start="1132.18" dur="5.19">sony created the interview of course</text>
  <text start="1133.95" dur="5.7">this movie was controlled and created by</text>
  <text start="1137.37" dur="3.99">the US government they wanted it made</text>
  <text start="1139.65" dur="3.33">because they were hoping it would be</text>
  <text start="1141.36" dur="3.63">leaked into North Korea and they were</text>
  <text start="1142.98" dur="4.29">hoping that someone would follow through</text>
  <text start="1144.99" dur="4.86">on this and assassinate the leader of</text>
  <text start="1147.27" dur="5.82">North Korea so what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1149.85" dur="4.92">right now is South Korea activists say</text>
  <text start="1153.09" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re going to launch balloons and</text>
  <text start="1154.77" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re going to tie copies of the</text>
  <text start="1157.35" dur="4.29">interview on to the balloons and have</text>
  <text start="1160.14" dur="3.57">them float into North Korea and</text>
  <text start="1161.64" dur="5.91">hopefully somebody there will see it and</text>
  <text start="1163.71" dur="6.6">act upon it and use it to assassinate</text>
  <text start="1167.55" dur="4.86">the leader now again this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1170.31" dur="3.96">ridiculous this is going to go nowhere</text>
  <text start="1172.41" dur="4.29">but you could see how desperate they are</text>
  <text start="1174.27" dur="6.87">to do this and to get rid of this leader</text>
  <text start="1176.7" dur="6.99">and again this is all part of what they</text>
  <text start="1181.14" dur="7.53">have been planning I see 2015 coming up</text>
  <text start="1183.69" dur="8.76">I see the economy declining even further</text>
