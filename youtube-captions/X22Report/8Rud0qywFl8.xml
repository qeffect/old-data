  <text start="225.739" dur="6.241">they can control governments around the</text>

  <text start="244.76" dur="4.32">the sovereignty of the people they then</text>
  <text start="247.13" dur="4.139">have control of the country think about</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="5.82">it they have control of the creation of</text>
  <text start="251.269" dur="6.451">money currency they have control over</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="6.99">the corporate media and if they can get</text>
  <text start="257.72" dur="5.55">control over what laws and what the</text>
  <text start="261.89" dur="5">government has to do in each one of</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="5.79">these countries they can sit on top of</text>
  <text start="266.89" dur="5.589">every single government and every</text>
  <text start="269.06" dur="6.93">government would be a puppet this is why</text>
  <text start="272.479" dur="8.071">they want the TTIP the TPP set up past</text>
  <text start="275.99" dur="8.489">so badly this would give them their</text>
  <text start="280.55" dur="6.03">one-world government and non when we</text>
  <text start="284.479" dur="5.581">look at the internet which has been</text>
  <text start="286.58" dur="6.6">moved to the UN now they can control the</text>
  <text start="290.06" dur="5.1">information flow on the internet they</text>
  <text start="293.18" dur="4.56">have control of the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="295.16" dur="5.84">have control of the currency and they</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="7.37">have control over the government&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="301" dur="6.07">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and</text>
  <text start="305.11" dur="4.54">what they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.07" dur="5.909">going to try to get rid of freedoms</text>
  <text start="309.65" dur="3.93">rights and each and every one of these</text>
  <text start="312.979" dur="2.761">countries</text>
  <text start="313.58" dur="4.89">even here in the United States it is</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="6.57">already started here in the United</text>
  <text start="318.47" dur="6.96">States I mean think about it civil asset</text>
  <text start="322.31" dur="5.639">forfeiture now this allows cops to seize</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="5.69">your property cash jewelry cars and even</text>
  <text start="327.949" dur="6.421">your home without without charging or</text>
  <text start="331.12" dur="5.5">convicting you with a crime the fifth</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="4.289">and fourteenth amendments are supposed</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="3.419">to prohibit the government taking of</text>
  <text start="338.659" dur="3.931">life liberty and property without due</text>
  <text start="340.039" dur="4.921">process of law but they found a way</text>
  <text start="342.59" dur="4.049">around it which they really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="3.419">because nothing overrides the</text>
  <text start="346.639" dur="4.02">Constitution the rights of the people</text>
  <text start="348.379" dur="5.371">but what they do is they try to make you</text>
  <text start="350.659" dur="5.91">believe that they found a way around it</text>
  <text start="353.75" dur="6.24">unless the people stand up guess what</text>
  <text start="356.569" dur="5.22">they will win every single time and make</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="4.26">everyone believe that they have the</text>
  <text start="361.789" dur="4.891">right to do this so what they did was in</text>
  <text start="364.25" dur="4.44">a civil asset forfeiture case the</text>
  <text start="366.68" dur="5.849">government proceeds directly against</text>
  <text start="368.69" dur="7.11">your property you don&amp;#39;t need to be</text>
  <text start="372.529" dur="5.371">convicted of a crime so a criminal</text>
  <text start="375.8" dur="4.32">procedure does not apply so they just go</text>
  <text start="377.9" dur="4.319">after your property and because the</text>
  <text start="380.12" dur="4.949">forfeiture is against your property you</text>
  <text start="382.219" dur="6.181">are a third-party claimant in related</text>
  <text start="385.069" dur="7.171">court proceedings basically this is</text>
  <text start="388.4" dur="6.509">legalized theft they did this throughout</text>
  <text start="392.24" dur="5.16">history you be riding down a road in</text>
  <text start="394.909" dur="4.201">your horse and carriage the government</text>
  <text start="397.4" dur="3.81">individuals would stop the horse and</text>
  <text start="399.11" dur="4.019">carriage and say give me your gold give</text>
  <text start="401.21" dur="4.709">me your silver you have no right to it</text>
  <text start="403.129" dur="5.76">the king wants it this is exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.919" dur="6.951">going on right here we also have the</text>
  <text start="408.889" dur="3.981">destruction of the health care system</text>
  <text start="413.259" dur="4.9">the Obama administration promised</text>
  <text start="415.55" dur="3.69">Americans the Affordable Care Act it</text>
  <text start="418.159" dur="2.22">would you know you&amp;#39;ll be able to keep</text>
  <text start="419.24" dur="3.179">your plan you&amp;#39;ll be able to keep your</text>
  <text start="420.379" dur="4.59">doctor premiums would be very low</text>
  <text start="422.419" dur="4.951">families making less than 250,000 per</text>
  <text start="424.969" dur="5.7">year when out see any form of tax</text>
  <text start="427.37" dur="5.909">increase there be more choices lower</text>
  <text start="430.669" dur="5.581">costs and every American would be</text>
  <text start="433.279" dur="4.771">insured mul not a single one of those</text>
  <text start="436.25" dur="3.81">promises have been kept in fact the</text>
  <text start="438.05" dur="5.959">opposite of every one of those has</text>
  <text start="440.06" dur="7.33">happened we also see excessive taxation</text>
  <text start="444.009" dur="5.961">Grover Norquist president of the</text>
  <text start="447.39" dur="5.13">Americans for Tax Reform said the</text>
  <text start="449.97" dur="5.7">American income tax is perhaps the most</text>
  <text start="452.52" dur="7.04">dramatic example of how our government</text>
  <text start="455.67" dur="8.85">grows at the expense of Liberty slowly</text>
  <text start="459.56" dur="7.18">constantly continuously and you can see</text>
  <text start="464.52" dur="4.08">it over time if we go back a hundred and</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="6.03">two years back to nineteen thirteen</text>
  <text start="468.6" dur="8.01">after 103 years we can see back in 1913</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="9.21">the top tax bracket was seven percent</text>
  <text start="476.61" dur="8.22">today it&amp;#39;s close to forty percent the</text>
  <text start="481.98" dur="5.94">tax bracket range back in 1913 was</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="7.68">between one and seven percent today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.92" dur="7.5">between ten and forty percent we see the</text>
  <text start="492.51" dur="5.91">family standard deduction in today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="495.42" dur="5.52">dollars was ninety four thousand eight</text>
  <text start="498.42" dur="7.44">hundred and thirty seven today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.94" dur="11.78">12,600 back in 1913 total pages and tax</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="10.83">code it was only 400 today 70 3954</text>
  <text start="512.72" dur="11.29">actually what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that</text>
  <text start="516.69" dur="11.04">if you work 52 weeks during 2016 16</text>
  <text start="524.01" dur="8.25">weeks of your labor went to the IRS so</text>
  <text start="527.73" dur="9.06">in reality you&amp;#39;re working what is that</text>
  <text start="532.26" dur="8.4">for months or so for free for the</text>
  <text start="536.79" dur="6.24">government and as time goes on this is</text>
  <text start="540.66" dur="6.24">going to get worse and worse this is how</text>
  <text start="543.03" dur="6.66">they enslave the population slowly but</text>
  <text start="546.9" dur="5.58">surely and we can see it when you look</text>
  <text start="549.69" dur="6.69">back over time it is completely apparent</text>
  <text start="552.48" dur="5.85">and we know that they&amp;#39;re very afraid of</text>
  <text start="556.38" dur="3.75">the people lining out about all of this</text>
  <text start="558.33" dur="3.72">many people don&amp;#39;t look at this they just</text>
  <text start="560.13" dur="3.18">accept it every single day and they</text>
  <text start="562.05" dur="2.4">realize eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="3.42">happen is people are going to get upset</text>
  <text start="564.45" dur="5.19">this happens throughout history and</text>
  <text start="566.73" dur="4.38">people are taxed way too much they work</text>
  <text start="569.64" dur="4.47">and work and work they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="571.11" dur="6.21">anywhere most of their money that they</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="6.08">earn goes to the government and what</text>
  <text start="577.32" dur="5.6">happens is these</text>
  <text start="580.19" dur="4.77">people in power they need to use force</text>
  <text start="582.92" dur="4.32">on those who are trying to take their</text>
  <text start="584.96" dur="3.72">power and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="587.24" dur="3.15">trying to take the weapons away from</text>
  <text start="588.68" dur="3.39">people this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="590.39" dur="2.94">make people believe they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="592.07" dur="2.94">freedom of the speech this is why</text>
  <text start="593.33" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re setting up free free speech</text>
  <text start="595.01" dur="5.52">zones this is why they created the drone</text>
  <text start="598.55" dur="4.98">laws where they&amp;#39;re saying that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="600.53" dur="6.2">fly drones and we&amp;#39;re already seeing that</text>
  <text start="603.53" dur="7.05">police departments now well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="606.73" dur="8.38">attaching stun guns to their police</text>
  <text start="610.58" dur="7.35">drones and we can see that they are in</text>
  <text start="615.11" dur="5.07">the initial phases right now but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="617.93" dur="4.83">experimenting with them and you know</text>
  <text start="620.18" dur="5.43">this is just one step away from arming a</text>
  <text start="622.76" dur="5.22">drone which eventually will happen and</text>
  <text start="625.61" dur="4.38">we knew this was going to happen going</text>
  <text start="627.98" dur="5.16">way back because it started out as</text>
  <text start="629.99" dur="5.28">cameras lights we&amp;#39;re just going to fly</text>
  <text start="633.14" dur="4.02">the drones over to observe and now</text>
  <text start="635.27" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re putting stun guns on there</text>
  <text start="637.16" dur="5.01">because if there is a crowd if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="639.5" dur="5.88">something going on they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="642.17" dur="5.4">these drones to keep order and once they</text>
  <text start="645.38" dur="5.07">figure out that the stun guns are not</text>
  <text start="647.57" dur="6.89">enough they will mount these drones with</text>
  <text start="650.45" dur="6.39">lethal weapons and this as we know</text>
  <text start="654.46" dur="4.3">always happens throughout history it</text>
  <text start="656.84" dur="5.88">might not be with drones but it&amp;#39;s with</text>
  <text start="658.76" dur="6.84">other technology of that time where they</text>
  <text start="662.72" dur="6.06">use it on the people and we can see</text>
  <text start="665.6" dur="5.61">right now what they&amp;#39;re most afraid of is</text>
  <text start="668.78" dur="5.04">the people they&amp;#39;re afraid for their</text>
  <text start="671.21" dur="4.59">authority they&amp;#39;re afraid that we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="673.82" dur="4.8">figure out it&amp;#39;s the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.8" dur="4.89">afraid we&amp;#39;ll figure out that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="678.62" dur="4.59">corrupt with they&amp;#39;re afraid that we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="680.69" dur="5.16">figure out it&amp;#39;s time for them to go if</text>
  <text start="683.21" dur="7.77">we can just stop fighting with each</text>
  <text start="685.85" dur="8.78">other and we can come together all come</text>
  <text start="690.98" dur="7.14">together black white orange purple</text>
  <text start="694.63" dur="6.94">doesn&amp;#39;t matter we&amp;#39;re all people we all</text>
  <text start="698.12" dur="6.81">want the same thing we want to live we</text>
  <text start="701.57" dur="5.76">want to bring up our children we want to</text>
  <text start="704.93" dur="5.19">make money that and keep the money that</text>
  <text start="707.33" dur="3.84">we earn we don&amp;#39;t want to hand it over to</text>
  <text start="710.12" dur="3.39">the government we don&amp;#39;t want to hand</text>
  <text start="711.17" dur="2.529">over our rights or freedoms we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="713.51" dur="2.079">want</text>
  <text start="713.699" dur="5.55">government to tell us what to do what to</text>
  <text start="715.589" dur="6.81">put in our bodies so if we can just all</text>
  <text start="719.249" dur="4.92">come together and stop fighting because</text>
  <text start="722.399" dur="4.88">the government really wants us to fight</text>
  <text start="724.169" dur="6.181">amongst each other once we can stop this</text>
  <text start="727.279" dur="6.52">we can be a force to be reckoned with</text>
  <text start="730.35" dur="8.429">and let me just say the government could</text>

  <text start="1247.76" dur="3.12">moving to the next</text>
  <text start="1248.87" dur="3.72">days and looks like what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1250.88" dur="5.01">to be doing is bringing in truck mounted</text>
  <text start="1252.59" dur="7.17">anti-aircraft weapons that could bring</text>

  <text start="1283.94" dur="4.32">where do we go from here well it looks</text>
  <text start="1286.19" dur="5.91">like we&amp;#39;re getting closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="1288.26" dur="6.84">world war because at that point they</text>
  <text start="1292.1" dur="5.16">want Syria and Russia to attack the</text>
