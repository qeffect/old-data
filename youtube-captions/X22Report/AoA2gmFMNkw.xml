  <text start="391.849" dur="8.22">well conspiracy no more we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="397.219" dur="5.79">about how certain individuals were</text>
  <text start="400.069" dur="5.761">prosecuted by because they manipulated</text>
  <text start="403.009" dur="5.94">the silver market now we have three</text>
  <text start="405.83" dur="6.989">individuals that have been manipulating</text>
  <text start="408.949" dur="6.39">the gold market and they were doing</text>
  <text start="412.819" dur="4.35">exactly what we&amp;#39;ve been telling everyone</text>
  <text start="415.339" dur="4.32">for a very long time we all thought the</text>
  <text start="417.169" dur="4.29">same thing someone&amp;#39;s throwing out these</text>
  <text start="419.659" dur="3.63">paper contracts millions of them and</text>

  <text start="423.289" dur="6.901">we have an individual and JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="427.3" dur="5.71">engage in a six year</text>
  <text start="430.19" dur="5.85">spoofing scheme that defrauded investors</text>
  <text start="433.01" dur="6.72">in gold silver platinum and palladium</text>
  <text start="436.04" dur="6.15">future contracts John Edmonds then 36</text>
  <text start="439.73" dur="5.34">pled guilty under seal in the District</text>
  <text start="442.19" dur="7.77">of Connecticut then we have an engine</text>
  <text start="445.07" dur="6.72">individual in Bear Stearns quarry Flom</text>
  <text start="449.96" dur="4.77">who worked as a trader at Bear Stearns</text>
  <text start="451.79" dur="5.04">and Bank of Nova Scotia also admitted to</text>
  <text start="454.73" dur="3.99">precious metals manipulation saying he</text>
  <text start="456.83" dur="4.49">placed thousands of bogus orders for</text>
  <text start="458.72" dur="7.56">future contracts over a nine-year period</text>
  <text start="461.32" dur="8.26">then we have Christian trunks another</text>
  <text start="466.28" dur="8.34">former JP Morgan metals trader pleaded</text>
  <text start="469.58" dur="9.15">guilty to precious metals spoofing to</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="6.99">manipulate the price now this trading</text>
  <text start="478.73" dur="4.92">strategy was admittedly intended to</text>
  <text start="481.61" dur="5.76">inject materially false and misleading</text>
  <text start="483.65" dur="5.91">liquidity and price information into the</text>
  <text start="487.37" dur="4.56">precious metal futures contracts markets</text>
  <text start="489.56" dur="4.83">by placing the spoof orders in order to</text>
  <text start="491.93" dur="5.61">deceive other market participants about</text>
  <text start="494.39" dur="4.53">the existence of supply and demand the</text>
  <text start="497.54" dur="3.6">spoof orders were designed to</text>
  <text start="498.92" dur="4.5">artificially move the price of precious</text>
  <text start="501.14" dur="4.77">metals future contracts in a direction</text>
  <text start="503.42" dur="4.89">that was favorable to Edmonds and his</text>
  <text start="505.91" dur="4.2">co-conspirators at the bank to the</text>
  <text start="508.31" dur="5.01">detriment of other market participants</text>
  <text start="510.11" dur="6">in pleading guilty Edmonds admitted that</text>
  <text start="513.32" dur="6">he learned his deceptive trading</text>
  <text start="516.11" dur="5.64">strategy from more senior traders at the</text>
  <text start="519.32" dur="4.29">bank and he personally deployed the</text>
  <text start="521.75" dur="4.2">strategy hundreds of times with that</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="5.64">knowledge and consent of his immediate</text>
  <text start="525.95" dur="8.46">supervisors hmm so what he&amp;#39;s saying here</text>
  <text start="529.25" dur="9.66">is that there are many many others who</text>
  <text start="534.41" dur="6.99">are involved in this scheme so that</text>
  <text start="538.91" dur="4.17">whole conspiracy thing about who</text>
  <text start="541.4" dur="5.28">someone&amp;#39;s manipulating the gold market</text>
  <text start="543.08" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s no longer a conspiracy someone</text>
  <text start="546.68" dur="5.31">manipulating the silver market it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="548.36" dur="6.72">longer a conspiracy people now are being</text>
  <text start="551.99" dur="6.69">arrested maybe that&amp;#39;s why we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="555.08" dur="5.7">seen the gold price or the silver get</text>
  <text start="558.68" dur="3.39">hit with millions and millions of</text>
  <text start="560.78" dur="3.57">contracts</text>
  <text start="562.07" dur="6">haven&amp;#39;t you noticed that this has not</text>
  <text start="564.35" dur="5.13">happened and as time goes on I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="568.07" dur="5.31">think we&amp;#39;re going to see it anymore</text>
  <text start="569.48" dur="7.4">which tells you something who is taking</text>
  <text start="573.38" dur="7.139">control of the economic system that</text>
  <text start="576.88" dur="5.8">Patriots are now very interestingly we</text>
  <text start="580.519" dur="5.791">mentioned this in the beginning Boston</text>
  <text start="582.68" dur="5.639">Fed president Eric Rosen gren said that</text>
  <text start="586.31" dur="5.279">the US central bank should be careful</text>
  <text start="588.319" dur="5.64">not to cut interest rates too much now</text>
  <text start="591.589" dur="4.56">because it would push us homeowners and</text>
  <text start="593.959" dur="6.961">businesses to take on more debt thus</text>
  <text start="596.149" dur="8.911">making any recession more painful now we</text>
  <text start="600.92" dur="7.349">need to think the opposite here the</text>
  <text start="605.06" dur="4.8">recession is not going to happen when</text>
  <text start="608.269" dur="4.32">the interest rates are lowered and</text>
  <text start="609.86" dur="4.44">stimulus has started the recession was</text>
  <text start="612.589" dur="5.581">going to happen when they continually</text>
  <text start="614.3" dur="5.43">raised the rates and they tightened so</text>
  <text start="618.17" dur="2.909">whatever the central bank is saying</text>
  <text start="619.73" dur="4.289">whatever the mainstream media is saying</text>
  <text start="621.079" dur="6.51">the opposite effect is going to happen</text>
  <text start="624.019" dur="6.781">and as we move forward once Trump gets</text>
  <text start="627.589" dur="6.81">the Fed to cut rates again and start</text>
  <text start="630.8" dur="5.49">stimulus we&amp;#39;re going to see the entire</text>
  <text start="634.399" dur="4.321">economic system take off now of course</text>
  <text start="636.29" dur="4.08">this is statistically remember he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="638.72" dur="4.229">doing this because he needs to keep the</text>
  <text start="640.37" dur="7.469">central bank system alive he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="642.949" dur="6.601">looking to cut taxes that is very</text>
  <text start="647.839" dur="4.591">important that will put a lot more money</text>
  <text start="649.55" dur="5.64">back into the people&amp;#39;s pockets to keep</text>
  <text start="652.43" dur="5.969">the system alive long enough to make it</text>
  <text start="655.19" dur="5.19">through the 2020 election this is all</text>
  <text start="658.399" dur="7.261">being done on purpose this is part of</text>
  <text start="660.38" dur="8.67">the plan because they understand that</text>
  <text start="665.66" dur="7.289">this system was supposed to implode on</text>
  <text start="669.05" dur="6.33">itself years ago and they were expecting</text>
  <text start="672.949" dur="4.291">someone else to be president right now</text>
  <text start="675.38" dur="4.68">they didn&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="677.24" dur="4.56">so Trump and the Patriots they needed a</text>
  <text start="680.06" dur="4.079">way to keep the system alive because of</text>
  <text start="681.8" dur="6">the system completely imploded on itself</text>
  <text start="684.139" dur="5.7">guess what Trump would never make it to</text>
  <text start="687.8" dur="4.8">the next term and they couldn&amp;#39;t continue</text>
  <text start="689.839" dur="3.961">with the plan now once we&amp;#39;re in the next</text>
  <text start="692.6" dur="5.4">term</text>
  <text start="693.8" dur="7.17">Trump at that point he has freedom the</text>
  <text start="698" dur="8.88">Patriots have a lot more freedom to do</text>
  <text start="700.97" dur="9.15">what he needs to do and remember their</text>
  <text start="706.88" dur="5.73">entire mission at this point is to</text>
  <text start="710.12" dur="2.97">restructure the Fed q has told us this</text>
  <text start="712.61" dur="4.89">before</text>
  <text start="713.09" dur="7.05">and to bring this system out of a</text>
  <text start="717.5" dur="5.07">central bank economy and into a people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="720.14" dur="5.22">economy just like it was brought out of</text>
  <text start="722.57" dur="5.94">a sound money system or parsley a sound</text>
  <text start="725.36" dur="6.6">money system back in 71 and it brought</text>

  <text start="731.96" dur="5.16">where the central bankers had full</text>

  <text start="774.41" dur="4.74">weapons against them we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="776.78" dur="5.1">the market hit all-time highs I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="779.15" dur="7.61">be surprised if we hit 28 29 maybe even</text>
  <text start="781.88" dur="9.78">30,000 Dow because once it hits that</text>
  <text start="786.76" dur="7.45">Trump coming into 2020 can say look at</text>

  <text start="794.21" dur="5.37">lowest unemployment GDP numbers are</text>
  <text start="796.87" dur="4.63">incredible look at this stock market and</text>
  <text start="799.58" dur="3.65">look at gold I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="801.5" dur="4.05">mention gold but we&amp;#39;ll look at gold</text>
  <text start="803.23" dur="6.13">because gold is gonna continually rise</text>

  <text start="819.44" dur="5.64">gets too high now remember if we go back</text>
  <text start="821.57" dur="5.99">to the 1913 calculation gold should be</text>
  <text start="825.08" dur="6.92">around 5954</text>
  <text start="827.56" dur="6.24">and silver should be at 724 per ounce</text>
  <text start="832" dur="3.36">remember they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating the</text>
  <text start="833.8" dur="4.62">gold and silver market for a very long</text>
  <text start="835.36" dur="4.74">time this is not where the price of gold</text>
  <text start="838.42" dur="4.44">and silver should be at this point and</text>
  <text start="840.1" dur="5.73">this is why I think gold is going to</text>
  <text start="842.86" dur="4.65">rise almost to this point or maybe it</text>
  <text start="845.83" dur="4.199">will hit this point do I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="847.51" dur="5.31">gonna be this year now but we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="850.029" dur="6.991">see incredible gains which lets us know</text>
  <text start="852.82" dur="5.03">that the Fiat paper system it&amp;#39;s dead in</text>
  <text start="857.02" dur="4.97">the water</text>
  <text start="857.85" dur="6.94">because it tells us it takes five</text>
  <text start="861.99" dur="6.42">thousand nine hundred and fifty four</text>
  <text start="864.79" dur="7.68">dollars now to buy one ounce of gold</text>
  <text start="868.41" dur="7.38">think about going all the way back to</text>
  <text start="872.47" dur="5.1">the Great Depression when it was around</text>
  <text start="875.79" dur="6.01">$35 an ounce</text>

  <text start="884.47" dur="3.63">buy one ounce</text>

  <text start="888.1" dur="4.38">failing that you need that much more</text>
  <text start="891.16" dur="3.21">that means the gold didn&amp;#39;t really go up</text>

  <text start="894.37" dur="5.13">the dollar it has been losing value over</text>
  <text start="897.88" dur="3.69">time and it takes a lot more of those</text>
  <text start="899.5" dur="5.49">dollars you need a lot more of them to</text>
  <text start="901.57" dur="7.32">buy the same exact ounce which tells you</text>
  <text start="904.99" dur="9.72">the Fiat system is dying and if we get</text>
  <text start="908.89" dur="9.39">to 2,000 2,500 3,000 the world is going</text>
