  <text start="52.74" dur="5.16">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="56.52" dur="4.83">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.9" dur="6.39">episode 1389 bee and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="5.46">September 29th 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="5.33">episode is is the kebab planning a</text>
  <text start="66.81" dur="5.34">global takedown of the financial system</text>
  <text start="69.62" dur="5.59">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="5.28">political and geopolitical news now</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="5.52">something strange is really happening in</text>
  <text start="77.43" dur="6.15">Cuba we see that there was this sonic</text>
  <text start="80.73" dur="4.29">blast and it really can&amp;#39;t be explained</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="2.73">the Cuban government saying that we have</text>
  <text start="85.02" dur="3.12">nothing to do with it&amp;#39;s actually the US</text>
  <text start="86.31" dur="3.9">government is saying they don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="88.14" dur="4.56">it was actually Cuba and I&amp;#39;m wondering</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="4.94">if they&amp;#39;re just using this as a type of</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="6.33">cover of why they&amp;#39;re withdrawing</text>
  <text start="95.15" dur="5.44">personnel from the Embassy there and it</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="3.21">looks like these senior US officials</text>
  <text start="100.59" dur="4.11">have told the associate press that the</text>
  <text start="102.24" dur="4.47">u.s. is pulling roughly 60% of its staff</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="3.75">out of Cuba and morning American</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="4.74">travelers not to visit due to specific</text>
  <text start="108.45" dur="6.12">attacks that have harm US diplomats and</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="5.37">at this point nobody really is saying</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="4.17">what this really is they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="5.67">the emergency personnel will remain in</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="4.98">this area and the Cuban government even</text>
  <text start="122.49" dur="2.79">the US government they don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="123.72" dur="3.959">that Cuba did this because this is kind</text>
  <text start="125.28" dur="5.699">of strange why would they go ahead and</text>
  <text start="127.679" dur="6.091">use a sonic device on the embassy it</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="4.831">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense whatsoever it is kind</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="4.05">of an act of war if they did do this</text>
  <text start="135.81" dur="5.34">because they actually attacked the</text>
  <text start="137.82" dur="5.16">people there and this some something</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="5.25">else seems like something has gone wrong</text>
  <text start="142.98" dur="5.1">now maybe something happened with the US</text>
  <text start="146.4" dur="3.72">where they were experimenting with</text>
  <text start="148.08" dur="4.77">something and something went awry and</text>
  <text start="150.12" dur="3.69">they don&amp;#39;t want to be found out and</text>
  <text start="152.85" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re just pointing the finger</text>
  <text start="153.81" dur="4.92">someplace else but we could see right</text>
  <text start="155.97" dur="6.03">now that people are leaving this area</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="6.06">now we know the Catalonian referendum</text>

  <text start="164.79" dur="4.32">Sunday when it&amp;#39;s going to happen the</text>
  <text start="166.62" dur="4.41">Spanish government they&amp;#39;re very angry</text>

  <text start="171.03" dur="2.73">it they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="172.35" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re sending the police out there and</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="7.16">there are going to be very big crowds on</text>
  <text start="177.36" dur="7.02">Sunday they&amp;#39;re getting ready to vote on</text>
  <text start="180.92" dur="5.05">their independence and we can see right</text>
  <text start="184.38" dur="2.38">now that they&amp;#39;re not going to be giving</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="2.799">up the kind</text>
  <text start="186.76" dur="3.96">government is saying yes we are moving</text>
  <text start="188.769" dur="3.39">forward with this they have their ballot</text>
  <text start="190.72" dur="4.829">boxes they&amp;#39;re made of grey and black</text>
  <text start="192.159" dur="5.521">opaque plastic and they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="195.549" dur="4.141">to hold this vote now there might be</text>
  <text start="197.68" dur="3.57">riots at this point in time we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="199.69" dur="3.689">to see what the spanish government does</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="4.11">and we could see that wall street and</text>
  <text start="203.379" dur="3.571">the rest of the nations they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="205.36" dur="3.81">nervous about this they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="5.429">to happen and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this</text>
  <text start="209.17" dur="4.5">happen as the brexit has happened and of</text>
  <text start="212.379" dur="3.841">course they&amp;#39;re still struggling with</text>
  <text start="213.67" dur="4.62">this we see Catalonia where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.22" dur="3.84">looking to separate themselves and maybe</text>
  <text start="218.29" dur="4.05">they will join the EU maybe they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="4.649">join it we don&amp;#39;t know at this point but</text>
  <text start="222.34" dur="3.509">we can see that this is all being done</text>
  <text start="224.709" dur="3.571">and there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot more</text>
  <text start="225.849" dur="4.2">countries that are looking to do this</text>
  <text start="228.28" dur="3.48">where they&amp;#39;re saying okay we want we</text>
  <text start="230.049" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t want to be part of the EU we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="4.619">want to be part of this country anymore</text>
  <text start="233.019" dur="5.101">and we want our independence and we can</text>
  <text start="236.379" dur="6.031">see that it was happening in the UK with</text>
  <text start="238.12" dur="5.82">Scotland and out in Syria well this is</text>
  <text start="242.41" dur="3.87">the United States actually pushing the</text>
  <text start="243.94" dur="4.889">Kurds at this point and this is not an a</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="4.65">grassroots type of uprising this is a</text>
  <text start="248.829" dur="4.77">little different out in Syria and of</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="5.369">course the Cabal is going to try to use</text>
  <text start="253.599" dur="4.89">what Catalonia is doing to what is</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="4.05">happening out in Iraq and Syria the</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="4.531">difference is the United States the</text>
  <text start="260.349" dur="5.671">Cabal they set that up they pushed it</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="5.519">just like the Arab you know spring the</text>
  <text start="266.02" dur="5.85">uprising in Syria that was all</text>
  <text start="268.539" dur="5.31">orchestrated by the Cabal by the deep</text>
  <text start="271.87" dur="5.4">state at the time to make it look like</text>
  <text start="273.849" dur="5.811">yes they want Assad out of power but if</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="6.84">you really look at it the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="7.36">there for Assad Assad brought in the</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="4.679">Russian government to help remove the</text>
  <text start="287.02" dur="4.14">paid mercenaries which were brought in</text>
  <text start="288.789" dur="4.94">by the United States by the coalition</text>
  <text start="291.16" dur="4.83">forces and he cleared the country of</text>
  <text start="293.729" dur="4.151">terrorism and the people if they had a</text>
  <text start="295.99" dur="4.71">vote today guess what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="5.37">vote for Assad we see something strange</text>
  <text start="300.7" dur="5.31">going on in North Korea right now South</text>
  <text start="303.25" dur="4.56">Korean president moon jae-in has called</text>
  <text start="306.01" dur="5.61">for the long-delayed transfer of its</text>
  <text start="307.81" dur="7.349">wartime operational control from the</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="6.599">Pentagon and what they&amp;#39;re saying is they</text>
  <text start="315.159" dur="5.48">want to transfer the wartime operational</text>
  <text start="318.219" dur="5.6">control and they think</text>
  <text start="320.639" dur="6.24">is the time to do it now it was taken</text>
  <text start="323.819" dur="4.62">away back in 1950 when General Douglas</text>
  <text start="326.879" dur="5.07">MacArthur took charge of the South</text>
  <text start="328.439" dur="5.97">Korean army in 1994 a US general served</text>
  <text start="331.949" dur="4.02">as its commander since then Seoul has</text>
  <text start="334.409" dur="4.41">taken back peacetime control of its</text>
  <text start="335.969" dur="5.19">Armed Forces but it delegated command to</text>
  <text start="338.819" dur="4.62">the US now they want control over</text>
  <text start="341.159" dur="4.171">everything they want the u.s. to step</text>
  <text start="343.439" dur="4.711">back they want to take control of</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="5.25">everything and I think at this point I</text>
  <text start="348.15" dur="5.069">think moon jae-in wants the control</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="5.79">because they don&amp;#39;t want the u.s. the</text>
  <text start="353.219" dur="5.01">Pentagon the Cabal to do something with</text>
  <text start="356.37" dur="3.569">North Korea and get things out of</text>
  <text start="358.229" dur="3.81">control I think they want control of the</text>
  <text start="359.939" dur="4.771">Armed Forces I think they want control</text>
  <text start="362.039" dur="5.1">of their country this way he can calm</text>
  <text start="364.71" dur="5.25">the situation down moon jae-in he wants</text>
  <text start="367.139" dur="5.041">peace in this area he does not want war</text>
  <text start="369.96" dur="4.919">he wants to talk to North Korea and of</text>
  <text start="372.18" dur="5.4">course the Cabal completely against this</text>
  <text start="374.879" dur="5.521">we see that Turkey they have made their</text>
  <text start="377.58" dur="4.53">payment for the s400 air defense system</text>
  <text start="380.4" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;ve received the payment but right</text>
  <text start="382.11" dur="3.779">now Russia is saying that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="3.599">have any dates of when they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="385.889" dur="4.111">supply this but most likely it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="387.779" dur="4.2">to be in the next couple of months we</text>
  <text start="390" dur="5.129">see the Iraqi government they have</text>
  <text start="391.979" dur="6.06">implemented a no-fly zone over the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="395.129" dur="4.621">Kurdistan area in particularly the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="398.039" dur="5.19">government no-fly zone covers the three</text>
  <text start="399.75" dur="5.099">KRG control provinces and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="403.229" dur="4.05">want planes flying over right now</text>
  <text start="404.849" dur="4.34">because they know what is going on here</text>
  <text start="407.279" dur="5.61">they understand that the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="409.189" dur="6.4">controlling the Kurds in this area they</text>
  <text start="412.889" dur="6.93">know that they&amp;#39;re trying to push chaos</text>
  <text start="415.589" dur="6.54">in this area why because they want to</text>
  <text start="419.819" dur="4.921">split these countries up this has been</text>
  <text start="422.129" dur="4.65">planned since the since the beginning</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="4.889">the Brookings Institute they&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="426.779" dur="6.63">these plans they wanted to separate the</text>
  <text start="429.629" dur="6.481">countries into the Kurds into the Sunni</text>
  <text start="433.409" dur="5.581">into the Shia into the Alawite and</text>
  <text start="436.11" dur="5.459">separate the entire area that was their</text>
  <text start="438.99" dur="4.47">plan all along and this is why the</text>
  <text start="441.569" dur="3.75">United States the Cabal was going into</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="3.75">all these countries having regime change</text>
  <text start="445.319" dur="4.14">and the last part of it was to break</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="5.669">them all apart and they&amp;#39;re still trying</text>
  <text start="449.459" dur="5.101">to do the last part of their plan but I</text>
  <text start="452.879" dur="3.961">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to work I think</text>
  <text start="454.56" dur="4.109">Russia Syria Iraq the government&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="456.84" dur="3.48">completely against this they know</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="3.781">exactly what the Cabal is trying to do</text>
  <text start="460.32" dur="3.93">and I think they&amp;#39;re gonna try to stop</text>
  <text start="462.45" dur="5.1">this any way they possibly can and all</text>
  <text start="464.25" dur="5.12">they have to do is continually beat the</text>
  <text start="467.55" dur="3.99">paid mercenaries push them out and</text>
  <text start="469.37" dur="4.45">Russia is already calling for United</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="4.59">States to leave this area we also see</text>
  <text start="473.82" dur="4.62">the long the largest stronghold of the</text>
  <text start="476.13" dur="4.86">Islamic state forces in central Syria</text>
  <text start="478.44" dur="5.25">well that has just been secured by the</text>
  <text start="480.99" dur="4.71">Syrian Arab army this is the Assad army</text>
  <text start="483.69" dur="4.26">and we see right now that the paid</text>
  <text start="485.7" dur="6">mercenaries they are doomed</text>
  <text start="487.95" dur="5.219">at this point we see the leader of the</text>
  <text start="491.7" dur="3.62">so-called the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="493.169" dur="5.781">Baghdad II who is completely fictional</text>
  <text start="495.32" dur="6.099">has released a 46 minute long message</text>
  <text start="498.95" dur="5.68">talking about you know how they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="501.419" dur="4.801">come after the Western nations I mean</text>
  <text start="504.63" dur="4.44">this again this is their last-ditch</text>
  <text start="506.22" dur="5.16">effort to try to scare the people of</text>
  <text start="509.07" dur="4.92">Europe the people of America and we know</text>
  <text start="511.38" dur="6.599">that these paid mercenaries the Islamic</text>
  <text start="513.99" dur="7.77">state it&amp;#39;s run by our own governments I</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="6.171">mean our black op type of intelligent</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="6.36">agencies are running all of this and</text>
  <text start="524.15" dur="6.939">again they&amp;#39;re behind all of this and</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="5.55">this is their last-ditch effort to try</text>
  <text start="531.089" dur="5.281">to scare everyone is it going to work</text>
  <text start="533.67" dur="4.83">well they might push some events in</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="4.02">different areas to try to get their</text>
  <text start="538.5" dur="3.06">message out that they&amp;#39;re still here and</text>
  <text start="540.39" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re still gonna try to do whatever</text>
  <text start="541.56" dur="5.19">they possibly can but I think time is</text>
  <text start="543.42" dur="6.6">ticking down and they&amp;#39;re losing their</text>
  <text start="546.75" dur="4.74">grip and this is this is the point where</text>
  <text start="550.02" dur="4.5">we should all be a little bit worried</text>
  <text start="551.49" dur="4.98">because when they can&amp;#39;t do anything else</text>
  <text start="554.52" dur="3.39">and time is ticking down and they have</text>
  <text start="556.47" dur="3.09">no other options left</text>
  <text start="557.91" dur="3.929">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to do something now</text>
  <text start="559.56" dur="6.72">very interestingly we saw airport</text>
  <text start="561.839" dur="6.691">systems they crash globally and people</text>
  <text start="566.28" dur="4.17">couldn&amp;#39;t get to their flights and</text>
  <text start="568.53" dur="4.38">something I mean they&amp;#39;re saying it was a</text>
  <text start="570.45" dur="4.62">glitch just like it was a glitch when</text>
  <text start="572.91" dur="6.51">the eastern seaboard the power went down</text>
  <text start="575.07" dur="6.84">I think this is all done on purpose</text>
  <text start="579.42" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re checking to see what they can do</text>
  <text start="581.91" dur="5.22">and back in 2003 when we had the power</text>
  <text start="585.39" dur="2.72">outage on the eastern seaboard I was in</text>
  <text start="587.13" dur="3.59">Manhattan at the</text>
  <text start="588.11" dur="5.19">and the power you know just completely</text>
  <text start="590.72" dur="3.75">failed him what I saw there was that</text>
  <text start="593.3" dur="4.259">people in the beginning were very very</text>
  <text start="594.47" dur="5.609">friendly and restaurants and bars they</text>
  <text start="597.559" dur="5.161">were giving away food very very cheaply</text>
  <text start="600.079" dur="4.86">because there was no power and what I</text>
  <text start="602.72" dur="3.959">saw was a lot of these buildings along</text>
  <text start="604.939" dur="4.59">with these corporations they had</text>
  <text start="606.679" dur="5.7">generators on top of their office</text>
  <text start="609.529" dur="5.4">buildings or in the basements but they</text>
  <text start="612.379" dur="4.981">only had enough fuel to last 2 or 3</text>
  <text start="614.929" dur="5.491">hours and the problem was is that trucks</text>
  <text start="617.36" dur="7.079">couldn&amp;#39;t get in there to refill the</text>
  <text start="620.42" dur="5.94">generators so power only lasted for</text>
  <text start="624.439" dur="5.46">about two to three hours and then boom</text>
  <text start="626.36" dur="7.259">it was done and a lot of the Manhattan</text>
  <text start="629.899" dur="5.34">was completely without power even as the</text>
  <text start="633.619" dur="3.75">generators went down there was just</text>
  <text start="635.239" dur="3.6">nothing and of course the rest of the</text>
  <text start="637.369" dur="3.66">people who weren&amp;#39;t prepared for this at</text>
  <text start="638.839" dur="3.9">all just had no power whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="641.029" dur="4.77">everyone didn&amp;#39;t know what to do at the</text>
  <text start="642.739" dur="5.01">point even the cell towers they were</text>
  <text start="645.799" dur="3.72">barely operating and Cole&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.749" dur="3.93">he couldn&amp;#39;t get calls in and out or</text>
  <text start="649.519" dur="4.771">anything like that the lines were very</text>
  <text start="651.679" dur="4.41">congested and at the time I was in an</text>
  <text start="654.29" dur="4.139">office where I was worked in the</text>
  <text start="656.089" dur="5.701">technology office and we had a lot of</text>
  <text start="658.429" dur="5.22">these battery power backups that we used</text>
  <text start="661.79" dur="3.87">for computer systems and we use them to</text>
  <text start="663.649" dur="3.891">power our devices and things like that</text>
  <text start="665.66" dur="3.69">but you can see that there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="667.54" dur="4.359">corporations a lot of businesses that</text>
  <text start="669.35" dur="4.769">are not prepared for this now this</text>
  <text start="671.899" dur="4.62">glitch that we&amp;#39;re seeing we need to</text>
  <text start="674.119" dur="4.741">understand what is happening here</text>
  <text start="676.519" dur="3.66">because if something like this can be</text>
  <text start="678.86" dur="3.06">brought down the power grid can be</text>
  <text start="680.179" dur="4.38">brought down we have a lot of warnings</text>
  <text start="681.92" dur="4.949">out there telling us that it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="684.559" dur="5.34">open and vulnerable to any type of</text>
  <text start="686.869" dur="4.621">malware attack the reason why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="689.899" dur="3.81">been building this up for a very long</text>
  <text start="691.49" dur="4.23">time telling us that North Korea could</text>
  <text start="693.709" dur="4.47">attack us Russia could attack us trying</text>
  <text start="695.72" dur="4.199">to could attack us is because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="698.179" dur="4.171">been preparing for this for quite a</text>
  <text start="699.919" dur="5.82">while I believe the malware is already</text>
  <text start="702.35" dur="5.539">set into these systems this is why they</text>
  <text start="705.739" dur="4.921">have these tests every single year</text>
  <text start="707.889" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re practicing they want to make</text>
  <text start="710.66" dur="4.769">sure they they know exactly what to</text>
  <text start="713.329" dur="4.081">expect and this is what they do in any</text>
  <text start="715.429" dur="3.63">type of false-flag think about the false</text>
  <text start="717.41" dur="3.659">flags that we see the physical false</text>
  <text start="719.059" dur="2.821">flags that we see they run through these</text>
  <text start="721.069" dur="3.031">tests</text>
  <text start="721.88" dur="5.1">of you know having the bomber come in</text>
  <text start="724.1" dur="4.44">having a shootout in a mall and they run</text>
  <text start="726.98" dur="3.57">through these tests over and over and</text>
  <text start="728.54" dur="3.03">over and then they have last tests and</text>
  <text start="730.55" dur="3.24">all of a sudden they have the false flag</text>
  <text start="731.57" dur="4.14">the same thing is going to happen with</text>
  <text start="733.79" dur="5.22">the cyber attack this is a little bit</text>
  <text start="735.71" dur="6.33">more complex they need to show that yes</text>
  <text start="739.01" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re being attacked and they really</text>
  <text start="742.04" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t have to hurt the systems they just</text>
  <text start="744.86" dur="4.02">have to make it look like they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="746.21" dur="3.18">you know attacked or shut certain things</text>
  <text start="748.88" dur="2.22">down</text>
  <text start="749.39" dur="3.18">to make people believe this because the</text>
  <text start="751.1" dur="3.75">corporate media can blow this completely</text>
  <text start="752.57" dur="3.72">out of proportion and make everyone</text>
  <text start="754.85" dur="4.02">believe it&amp;#39;s a lot worse than it really</text>
  <text start="756.29" dur="5.64">is and they can close the banking system</text>
  <text start="758.87" dur="7.08">with no problem and this would be the</text>
  <text start="761.93" dur="7.86">start of the system coming down and we</text>
  <text start="765.95" dur="5.34">might actually see the Cabal becomes so</text>
  <text start="769.79" dur="3.24">desperate the central bank becomes so</text>
  <text start="771.29" dur="4.74">desperate because if they cannot start</text>
  <text start="773.03" dur="5.88">that war to cover up this economic class</text>
  <text start="776.03" dur="5.49">this collapse they they&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="778.91" dur="5.58">something because they just can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="781.52" dur="5.7">well the economy just fell apart yes it</text>
  <text start="784.49" dur="4.59">crashed we told you a lie for the last</text>
  <text start="787.22" dur="3.3">eight or nine years because you know</text>
  <text start="789.08" dur="3.15">what happens when the collapse happens</text>
  <text start="790.52" dur="3.72">the truth starts to come out you start</text>
  <text start="792.23" dur="3.69">to realize what&amp;#39;s really going on you</text>
  <text start="794.24" dur="3.48">start to realize that all these</text>
  <text start="795.92" dur="4.8">companies well they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="797.72" dur="5.96">bankrupt the financial institutions</text>
  <text start="800.72" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re completely insolvent and the Fed</text>
  <text start="803.68" dur="6.49">they have no answer for any of this so</text>
  <text start="806.15" dur="6.93">they need something to distract everyone</text>
  <text start="810.17" dur="5.34">and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="813.08" dur="3.93">to try to do and this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="815.51" dur="2.88">been building up for this is why Janet</text>
  <text start="817.01" dur="4.59">Napolitano when she was leaving</text>
  <text start="818.39" dur="5.55">DHS it&amp;#39;s not if but when we have some</text>
  <text start="821.6" dur="5.25">pipe some type of cyber attack and I do</text>
  <text start="823.94" dur="5.13">believe that this is still being planned</text>
  <text start="826.85" dur="4.74">behind the scenes this is going to be</text>
  <text start="829.07" dur="4.35">their last event if they can&amp;#39;t get the</text>
  <text start="831.59" dur="3.24">war started even if they do get the war</text>
  <text start="833.42" dur="4.17">started they&amp;#39;re going to implement this</text>
  <text start="834.83" dur="4.5">also they&amp;#39;re gonna you know have some</text>
  <text start="837.59" dur="4.14">type of cyber attack with the war but if</text>
  <text start="839.33" dur="5.19">they can&amp;#39;t get the physical part of the</text>
  <text start="841.73" dur="5.25">war started I think they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="844.52" dur="4.95">push this type of an event because you</text>
  <text start="846.98" dur="3.57">really don&amp;#39;t have to prove that much I</text>
  <text start="849.47" dur="3.99">mean they can have the corporate media</text>
  <text start="850.55" dur="4.95">out there repeating it over and over and</text>
  <text start="853.46" dur="4.5">over that the institutions are</text>
  <text start="855.5" dur="4.65">attacked the institution&amp;#39;s can say yes</text>
  <text start="857.96" dur="4.14">we are being attacked and this could be</text>
  <text start="860.15" dur="4.05">coming from DHS it could be coming from</text>
  <text start="862.1" dur="3.99">the CIA but again they can bounce it off</text>
  <text start="864.2" dur="3.72">many servers to make it look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="866.09" dur="3.66">coming from different areas and they</text>
  <text start="867.92" dur="4.14">they can make the financial institutions</text>
  <text start="869.75" dur="4.68">believe that yes this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="872.06" dur="6.33">outside shut everything down it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="874.43" dur="6.63">easy to do and by having now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="878.39" dur="9.14">planted within the system all they have</text>
  <text start="881.06" dur="10.56">to do is basically have that turn on and</text>
  <text start="887.53" dur="6.52">let it do its job and they can have it</text>
  <text start="891.62" dur="4.29">maybe siphon off some of the funds or</text>
  <text start="894.05" dur="3.69">make it look like funds aren&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="895.91" dur="4.2">there and the financial institutions</text>
  <text start="897.74" dur="6.39">will then report that they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="900.11" dur="6.42">major problems and this is why we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="904.13" dur="4.17">been always saying keep only what you</text>
  <text start="906.53" dur="3.24">need in the banking system to pay your</text>
  <text start="908.3" dur="2.13">bills that&amp;#39;s personally that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="909.77" dur="3.68">opinion</text>
  <text start="910.43" dur="5.1">keep a lot of it in gold and silver I</text>
  <text start="913.45" dur="4.36">mean if you&amp;#39;re gonna keep cash don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="915.53" dur="4.2">tell anyone where it is but we can see</text>
  <text start="917.81" dur="4.44">that this is eventually going to happen</text>
  <text start="919.73" dur="3.96">and remember there are bail in documents</text>
  <text start="922.25" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;ve created them they create them</text>
  <text start="923.69" dur="4.8">for a reason they don&amp;#39;t just create them</text>
  <text start="925.64" dur="4.11">out of thin air they need them later on</text>
  <text start="928.49" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;s why they create them and they</text>
  <text start="929.75" dur="4.74">test them they tested it in Cyprus they</text>
  <text start="931.94" dur="5.49">try to in Greece they did it in India</text>
  <text start="934.49" dur="5.88">and they continually test what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="937.43" dur="6">going to do to make sure that everything</text>
  <text start="940.37" dur="5.34">is done properly and we can see right</text>
  <text start="943.43" dur="3.96">now that they create these things</text>
  <text start="945.71" dur="3.06">because they realize that the</text>
  <text start="947.39" dur="3.48">government&amp;#39;s are not going to bail out</text>
  <text start="948.77" dur="4.17">anything they&amp;#39;re gonna have to go into</text>
  <text start="950.87" dur="3.72">the banking system and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="952.94" dur="5.01">have to shut the banking system down and</text>
  <text start="954.59" dur="7.62">keep it shut down for a prolonged period</text>
  <text start="957.95" dur="6.18">of time and when this does happen this</text>
  <text start="962.21" dur="4.29">will be the beginning of the system</text>
  <text start="964.13" dur="4.56">coming down now it might be a few couple</text>
  <text start="966.5" dur="3.36">of banks in the beginning where comes</text>
  <text start="968.69" dur="3.27">out in the corporate media saying oh</text>
  <text start="969.86" dur="4.32">these little mom-and-pop banks were head</text>
  <text start="971.96" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s not a big deal but they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="974.18" dur="3">into it and then they can say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="975.71" dur="4.44">growing a little bit more and a little</text>
  <text start="977.18" dur="4.68">bit more and before you know it it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="980.15" dur="3.66">entire financial system and remember the</text>
  <text start="981.86" dur="4.86">stock market the bad system the Nasdaq</text>
  <text start="983.81" dur="5.45">they all have kill switches they were</text>
  <text start="986.72" dur="4.37">created a couple of years ago</text>
  <text start="989.26" dur="4.11">because they can stop the market from</text>
  <text start="991.09" dur="4.74">coming down when it gets out of hand and</text>
  <text start="993.37" dur="3.99">the free money the plunge Protection</text>
  <text start="995.83" dur="3.75">team can&amp;#39;t handle it anymore they just</text>
  <text start="997.36" dur="5.64">throw the switch and say okay the</text>
  <text start="999.58" dur="6.51">markets are now closed so we can see</text>
  <text start="1003" dur="6.12">that the Cabal this is going to be their</text>
