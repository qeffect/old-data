  <text start="170.64" dur="4.2">continually pushing out the idea and we</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="3.599">talked about this yesterday that the</text>
  <text start="174.84" dur="4.35">economy is going to be going into a</text>

  <text start="192.72" dur="5.4">elections were coming up they did this</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="5.119">on purpose they&amp;#39;re putting it out there</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="5.94">and projecting it right now on purpose</text>
  <text start="201.049" dur="6.19">because they do believe they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="5.09">control they do believe that if the</text>
  <text start="207.239" dur="4.981">economy comes down during this period</text>
  <text start="209.15" dur="5.11">they will blame it on Trump and he will</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="5.67">not get reelected this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.26" dur="5.43">hoping actually think back to 2008 when</text>
  <text start="217.89" dur="5.069">the economy completely fell apart we had</text>
  <text start="219.69" dur="4.859">Obama and we had McCain now they were</text>
  <text start="222.959" dur="4.59">running for election</text>
  <text start="224.549" dur="4.681">neither was a good choice I know but</text>
  <text start="227.549" dur="6.181">what happened was the stock market</text>
  <text start="229.23" dur="6.69">completely fell apart Obama was saying</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="4.2">that the economy was not really doing</text>
  <text start="235.92" dur="4.05">that well that there were problems</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="4.889">McCain had no clue he was reporting that</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="4.95">the economy&amp;#39;s fine Obama was informed</text>
  <text start="242.819" dur="3.361">about what was really going on and how</text>
  <text start="244.92" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re going to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="7.38">and this enabled him to push ahead in</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="5.88">the polls they&amp;#39;re trying to use this</text>
  <text start="253.56" dur="5.13">strategy now in the upcoming election in</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="5.13">2020 this is why they&amp;#39;re laying the</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="4.77">groundwork right now for 2019 saying</text>
  <text start="261.63" dur="4.44">that the economy is going to slow and</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="5.25">then in 2020 it&amp;#39;s going to crash and</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re hoping with this that the</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="3.269">American people say huh</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="3.66">look at that the whole thing just fell</text>

  <text start="325.36" dur="4.049">completely declining now this is not</text>
  <text start="327.849" dur="5.011">because of Trump this is not because of</text>

  <text start="332.86" dur="5.279">cuts the economy wasn&amp;#39;t real from the</text>
  <text start="335.65" dur="5.699">beginning all Trump is doing right now</text>
  <text start="338.139" dur="4.981">is he&amp;#39;s massaging the statistical</text>
  <text start="341.349" dur="3.481">numbers now it&amp;#39;s very interesting and</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;ll get into this in the next report</text>

  <text start="346.75" dur="5.819">report on the success of the statistical</text>
  <text start="350.199" dur="6.18">numbers they don&amp;#39;t want to give Trump</text>
  <text start="352.569" dur="6.18">credit because they know that it&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="356.379" dur="4.771">gigantic manipulation game and they</text>

  <text start="361.15" dur="5.759">just kind of ignoring it all together</text>
  <text start="363.099" dur="6.35">and they&amp;#39;re saying yeah it looks good</text>
  <text start="366.909" dur="5.43">but and they make up another whole story</text>
  <text start="369.449" dur="4.75">because they know exactly what their</text>
  <text start="372.339" dur="4.471">agenda is and they know they know what</text>
  <text start="374.199" dur="4.981">Trump is trying to do little do they</text>

  <text start="832.38" dur="7.53">full control this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="835.37" dur="5.62">now we can see that everything is going</text>
  <text start="839.91" dur="3.06">to change we&amp;#39;re going to be owned</text>
  <text start="840.99" dur="5.76">through this transition and I believe</text>
  <text start="842.97" dur="6.99">that Trump Xi Jinping Putin they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="846.75" dur="6.05">working together to change and get out</text>

  <text start="852.8" dur="4.03">believe they&amp;#39;re going to try to make</text>
  <text start="854.55" dur="4.56">this as easily as possible this is why</text>
  <text start="856.83" dur="5.7">they need key players in certain</text>
  <text start="859.11" dur="5.07">positions and I think what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="862.53" dur="4.02">happen here is we will enter a</text>
  <text start="864.18" dur="5.37">transition and we know from cue gold</text>
  <text start="866.55" dur="5.16">will eventually bring down the Fed and I</text>
  <text start="869.55" dur="7.83">do believe these countries are going to</text>
  <text start="871.71" dur="9.24">move back into gold in some form some</text>
  <text start="877.38" dur="5.58">way do I think all the currency will be</text>
  <text start="880.95" dur="4.95">backed by gold no I think they&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="882.96" dur="5.22">gold as a confidence builder showing</text>
  <text start="885.9" dur="4.29">that yes we still have currency maybe</text>
  <text start="888.18" dur="5.76">you&amp;#39;ll be a cryptocurrency maybe you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="890.19" dur="6.33">be paper currency but we have gold that</text>
  <text start="893.94" dur="6.18">were holding in our vaults just in case</text>

  <text start="900.12" dur="5.13">doing here is okay</text>
  <text start="902.49" dur="4.89">and I believe this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="905.25" dur="4.02">shooting for this is why Russia China</text>
  <text start="907.38" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;ve been accumulating a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="909.27" dur="4.44">this was being done for a completely</text>
  <text start="911.94" dur="6.51">different reason now I think they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="918.45" dur="9.45">central bank system an Anan asked Q if</text>
  <text start="923.7" dur="5.79">the US has gold Hugh said yes we have</text>
  <text start="927.9" dur="4.05">gold and it will bring down the Fed now</text>
  <text start="929.49" dur="4.62">it might not be in Fort Knox but there</text>
  <text start="931.95" dur="3.03">must be gold someplace maybe it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="934.11" dur="3.87">national parks</text>
  <text start="934.98" dur="6.48">maybe it&amp;#39;s protected and they know the</text>
  <text start="937.98" dur="7.32">gold is there that could be but once</text>
  <text start="941.46" dur="7.38">again they already have the gold so we</text>
  <text start="945.3" dur="4.89">know that the US China Russia many other</text>
  <text start="948.84" dur="3.69">countries have the goal</text>

  <text start="952.53" dur="3.93">hate the most even though they have it</text>
  <text start="954.33" dur="4.83">they don&amp;#39;t want the people to know that</text>
  <text start="956.46" dur="4.98">gold is real money and they&amp;#39;re nervous</text>
