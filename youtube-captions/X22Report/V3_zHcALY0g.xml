  <text start="87.17" dur="6.42">where the central bank was in control of</text>
  <text start="90.59" dur="6.029">everything and then Trump came into the</text>
  <text start="93.59" dur="6.449">picture and in the beginning the central</text>
  <text start="96.619" dur="5.61">bank was on a certain agenda taking</text>
  <text start="100.039" dur="4.531">orders from the deep state you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="102.229" dur="6.21">working together and they were raising</text>
  <text start="104.57" dur="6.899">the rates trying to destroy the economy</text>
  <text start="108.439" dur="5.57">because they knew that if the economy</text>
  <text start="111.469" dur="5.911">was strong during the 2020 election</text>
  <text start="114.009" dur="6.4">people would vote for Trump because when</text>
  <text start="117.38" dur="4.82">people lose money people lose their</text>
  <text start="120.409" dur="4.231">investments people lose their pension</text>
  <text start="122.2" dur="6.22">people say you know something this is</text>
  <text start="124.64" dur="7.95">not good for us and they were raising</text>
  <text start="128.42" dur="6.12">the rates in 2016 2017 2018 Trump the</text>
  <text start="132.59" dur="5.7">Patriots they turned everything around</text>
  <text start="134.54" dur="8.7">and we have an indicator showing that</text>
  <text start="138.29" dur="10.26">the Fed actually has no reason to cut</text>
  <text start="143.24" dur="8.88">rates remember during 2016 2017 2018 and</text>
  <text start="148.55" dur="7.56">going into 2019 the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="152.12" dur="7.32">were much higher the GDP numbers were a</text>
  <text start="156.11" dur="6.6">little bit lower the stock market was</text>
  <text start="159.44" dur="4.49">lower so think about this for a sec the</text>
  <text start="162.71" dur="6.169">numbers have it in</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="9.119">proved in the year 2019 now the Fed in</text>
  <text start="168.879" dur="8.431">their minutes it showed that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="173.049" dur="7.711">have any reason to cut the policy rates</text>
  <text start="177.31" dur="6.079">they looked at the economy and they</text>
  <text start="180.76" dur="5.49">reported that it is stronger than ever</text>
  <text start="183.389" dur="6.671">consumers are spending unemployment is</text>
  <text start="186.25" dur="8.79">very low and everything looks fantastic</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="8.789">so why do they cut they cut the rates</text>
  <text start="195.04" dur="8.279">because the Patriots are in control and</text>
  <text start="198.849" dur="7.47">it seems like the Fed is now divided Fed</text>
  <text start="203.319" dur="5.67">officials are taking sides we have the</text>
  <text start="206.319" dur="5.971">good Fed officials and we have the bad</text>
  <text start="208.989" dur="4.95">Fed officials now remember there are</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="5.819">certain individuals within the Federal</text>
  <text start="213.939" dur="7.2">Reserve that want the Federal Reserve to</text>
  <text start="218.109" dur="4.74">be in full control then we have the good</text>
  <text start="221.139" dur="5.011">guys who say the Federal Reserve the</text>
  <text start="222.849" dur="7.01">central bank system well we shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="7.169">have this and for a very long time</text>
  <text start="229.859" dur="7.66">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="233.319" dur="8.7">central bank system and now they have</text>
  <text start="237.519" dur="7.201">the opportunity to do so and we</text>
  <text start="242.019" dur="5.22">understand that the central bank system</text>
  <text start="244.72" dur="5.909">is not a benefit to the people</text>
  <text start="247.239" dur="6.96">whatsoever creating currency with</text>
  <text start="250.629" dur="7.251">interest attached does not work for the</text>
  <text start="254.199" dur="6.96">people and we can see that eventually</text>
  <text start="257.88" dur="6.009">this all has to be dismantled</text>
  <text start="261.159" dur="5.341">just like the globalist trade deals now</text>
  <text start="263.889" dur="5.191">very interestingly we know that the</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="5.039">China trade talks are coming up China</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="5.13">right now they&amp;#39;re losing between a third</text>
  <text start="271.539" dur="4.671">and a half of its pig herds as a result</text>
  <text start="274.21" dur="5.01">of the unprecedented decimation</text>
  <text start="276.21" dur="5.53">unleashed by African swine fever and</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re having a problem what does this</text>
  <text start="281.74" dur="6.78">mean China is increasingly finding</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="6.24">itself at America&amp;#39;s mercy China&amp;#39;s hog</text>
  <text start="288.52" dur="6.84">herd is collapsing Beijing right now is</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="6.24">importing US pork and it has exploded to</text>
  <text start="295.36" dur="4.56">a weekly record according</text>
  <text start="297.55" dur="5.37">to USDA data in a week ending October</text>
  <text start="299.92" dur="5.07">third Pig imports soared to a hundred</text>
  <text start="302.92" dur="3.92">and forty two thousand two hundred</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="4.29">metric tons more than seven times</text>
  <text start="306.84" dur="4.45">greater than September&amp;#39;s total shipment</text>
  <text start="309.28" dur="4.44">of nineteen thousand nine hundred tons</text>
  <text start="311.29" dur="4.92">China signal it might import as much as</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="4.98">four hundred thousand tonnes to stem a</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="6.36">domestic shortfall and now it appears</text>
  <text start="318.7" dur="6.54">that the US may be the easiest source to</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="7.32">get the pigs what does this mean</text>
  <text start="325.24" dur="8.52">this means that Trump has leverage right</text>
  <text start="329.89" dur="7.29">now on the trade talks he can use this</text>
  <text start="333.76" dur="5.61">to his advantage which I believe he will</text>
  <text start="337.18" dur="6.45">be doing now Trump let everyone know</text>
  <text start="339.37" dur="7.17">that the US and China they are now going</text>
  <text start="343.63" dur="6.66">to meet on the trade talks and he</text>
  <text start="346.54" dur="7.17">doesn&amp;#39;t really know if he really wants</text>
  <text start="350.29" dur="5.82">to make a deal remember tariffs are in</text>
  <text start="353.71" dur="5.04">place cut it&amp;#39;s putting pressure on</text>
  <text start="356.11" dur="5.31">companies companies are finding it very</text>
  <text start="358.75" dur="5.22">expensive to stay in China once they</text>
  <text start="361.42" dur="4.62">move out of China it&amp;#39;s too expensive to</text>
  <text start="363.97" dur="4.89">move back in so either they go to</text>
  <text start="366.04" dur="7.05">another country or they have to come</text>
  <text start="368.86" dur="7.35">back to the United States and Trump</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="4.68">doesn&amp;#39;t know should we make a deal or</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="2.82">should we keep this going for a little</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="4.32">bit longer he tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="379.03" dur="6.06">big day of negotiations with China they</text>
  <text start="382.09" dur="4.74">want to make a deal but do why I meet</text>
  <text start="385.09" dur="4.29">with the Vice Premier tomorrow at the</text>
  <text start="386.83" dur="6.33">White House we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this</text>
  <text start="389.38" dur="8.06">all plays out now Trump now has made a</text>
  <text start="393.16" dur="7.44">move to take back the American economy</text>
  <text start="397.44" dur="7.51">take it back from the central bankers</text>
  <text start="400.6" dur="8.55">from the deep state and Trump made his</text>
  <text start="404.95" dur="6.48">move remember there was a contract that</text>
  <text start="409.15" dur="6.03">the Obama administration signed it was a</text>
  <text start="411.43" dur="5.91">long-term deal and a giant Chinese</text>
  <text start="415.18" dur="3.75">company was set to control the second</text>

  <text start="449.74" dur="6.51">that Long Beach port kind of rings a</text>
  <text start="453.52" dur="6.57">bell actually makes us think of Adam</text>
