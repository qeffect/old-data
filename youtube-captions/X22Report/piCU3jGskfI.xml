  <text start="100.53" dur="6.399">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="103.33" dur="7.05">political and geopolitical news now we</text>
  <text start="106.929" dur="6.151">know that Trump on his campaign trail he</text>
  <text start="110.38" dur="5.43">kept on talking about NAFTA he kept on</text>
  <text start="113.08" dur="6.239">talking about global warming and he made</text>
  <text start="115.81" dur="6.419">a lot of promises and like we said we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="119.319" dur="6.03">looking at both sides here to see if he</text>
  <text start="122.229" dur="5.101">is within the deep state and now we are</text>
  <text start="125.349" dur="4.08">leaning towards more that the deep state</text>
  <text start="127.33" dur="4.47">has him now there are still certain</text>
  <text start="129.429" dur="5.431">parts of him where he&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="131.8" dur="6.03">certain things but it looks like things</text>
  <text start="134.86" dur="7.349">are closing in around him and that 1%</text>
  <text start="137.83" dur="7.2">hope is dropping in percentages to may</text>
  <text start="142.209" dur="5.041">be 0.5% hope because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="145.03" dur="3.69">right now is that on the day the White</text>
  <text start="147.25" dur="2.909">House threatened to withdraw from the</text>
  <text start="148.72" dur="4.95">North American Free Trade Agreement</text>
  <text start="150.159" dur="6.061">that&amp;#39;s NAFTA Trump&amp;#39;s son-in-law Jared</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="4.44">Kushner well he emerged as the key</text>
  <text start="156.22" dur="4.799">conduit between the United States and</text>
  <text start="158.11" dur="5.4">Canada now according to White House</text>
  <text start="161.019" dur="5.401">officials aides to Canadian Prime</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="5.49">Minister Justin Trudeau called Kushner</text>
  <text start="166.42" dur="4.26">urgently on April 26 after seeing news</text>
  <text start="169" dur="3.54">reports that Trump was considering</text>
  <text start="170.68" dur="3.18">signing the executive order which was</text>
  <text start="172.54" dur="4.259">going to withdraw the United States from</text>
  <text start="173.86" dur="5.79">NAFTA now Kushner who has an expansive</text>
  <text start="176.799" dur="4.77">profile that includes foreign policy</text>
  <text start="179.65" dur="3.63">speaks regularly to Canadian officials</text>
  <text start="181.569" dur="4.021">on ranges of issues</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="3.57">well Kushner told his Canadian</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="3.24">counterpart that</text>
  <text start="186.85" dur="4.08">this was a matter the leaders need to</text>
  <text start="188.83" dur="4.53">discuss themselves according to the</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="5.09">White House official and of course the</text>
  <text start="193.36" dur="6.6">White House official remains anonymous</text>
  <text start="196.02" dur="7.51">now the Canadian media reports something</text>
  <text start="199.96" dur="6.17">completely different that Trudeau wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="203.53" dur="5.79">the one who called Kushner Kushner</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="6.94">actually reached out to Trudeau chief of</text>
  <text start="209.32" dur="7.83">staff to suggest a call between the two</text>
  <text start="213.07" dur="10.05">leaders so if this is true it looks like</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="9.54">Kushner has basically saved NAFTA or is</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="7.38">getting involved in the everyday</text>
  <text start="226.69" dur="6.33">politics in the White House where Trump</text>
  <text start="230.5" dur="4.58">promised to get rid of NAFTA he was</text>
  <text start="233.02" dur="5.37">ready to sign the Executive Order and</text>
  <text start="235.08" dur="6.94">Kushner stepped in now this tells us</text>
  <text start="238.39" dur="6.57">that Kushner then is working for the</text>
  <text start="242.02" dur="6.8">deep state now let&amp;#39;s move on to the</text>
  <text start="244.96" dur="6.54">Paris climate deal now during Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="248.82" dur="4.9">campaign he said he was going to remove</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="4.11">the United States from the Paris climate</text>
  <text start="253.72" dur="5.07">deal because global warming is a</text>
  <text start="255.61" dur="5.87">complete hoax and he ran on this so he</text>
  <text start="258.79" dur="4.77">ran on getting rid of NAFTA he ran on</text>
  <text start="261.48" dur="4.48">pulling the United States out of the</text>
  <text start="263.56" dur="5.51">Paris climate deal and now the White</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="5.85">House well they decided to delay</text>
  <text start="269.07" dur="4.72">removing the United States out of the</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="5.55">Paris climate deal now what do I mean by</text>
  <text start="273.79" dur="7.86">that they decided not to meet on this</text>
  <text start="277.36" dur="8.4">issue until after the g7 leaders meet in</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="6.11">late May and we know through different</text>
  <text start="285.76" dur="4.86">reports that Ivanka and Jared are</text>
  <text start="287.76" dur="5.64">supposedly talking to Trump saying we</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="7.02">need to stay in the Paris climate deal</text>
  <text start="293.4" dur="7.42">now when we come up to that point where</text>
  <text start="297.64" dur="5.54">Trump has to make a decision and he goes</text>
  <text start="300.82" dur="5.64">back on his promise if he does do this</text>
  <text start="303.18" dur="6.07">he is then in line with the deep State</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="5.55">and he has gone back on his word with</text>
  <text start="309.25" dur="6.75">NAFTA he has gone back on his word with</text>
  <text start="312.01" dur="6.69">the Paris climate deal and he is going</text>
  <text start="316" dur="4.38">down a path where he is getting into bed</text>
  <text start="318.7" dur="4.17">with the deep state</text>
  <text start="320.38" dur="5.16">turning his back on everyone that voted</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="4.26">for him now in the beginning we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.54" dur="3.45">starting we needed to look at every</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="3.51">single thing and every action that he</text>
  <text start="328.99" dur="4.92">did because a lot of things are being</text>
  <text start="330.64" dur="4.44">said now he hasn&amp;#39;t signed on to the</text>
  <text start="333.91" dur="2.97">Paris climate deal</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="3.6">he hasn&amp;#39;t removed the United States from</text>
  <text start="336.88" dur="2.55">the Paris climate deal he has done</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="3.38">nothing yet</text>
  <text start="339.43" dur="5.43">NAFTA he still intend to go in in in</text>
  <text start="342.06" dur="6.07">negotiations to see how that all works</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="6">out now we&amp;#39;re still waiting to see what</text>
  <text start="348.13" dur="6.51">he does at this point but we can see</text>
  <text start="350.86" dur="6.51">that things are not in his favor as of</text>
  <text start="354.64" dur="5.31">right now the only thing that is working</text>
  <text start="357.37" dur="3.81">is that the arrests of people caught</text>
  <text start="359.95" dur="3.84">trying to sneak into the United States</text>
  <text start="361.18" dur="5.61">from the Mexican border well it is</text>
  <text start="363.79" dur="6.84">declined again it&amp;#39;s amazing when you</text>
  <text start="366.79" dur="5.49">follow the law and you actually take</text>
  <text start="370.63" dur="4.5">those people who are coming across the</text>
  <text start="372.28" dur="6.72">border illegally and you send them back</text>
  <text start="375.13" dur="6.84">all of a sudden less and less people try</text>
  <text start="379" dur="4.83">to do it unless and less illegal</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="3.48">immigrants enter the country it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="383.83" dur="3.18">the same as immigrants these are</text>
  <text start="385.45" dur="4.29">illegals that aren&amp;#39;t going through the</text>
  <text start="387.01" dur="6.21">process and it&amp;#39;s amazing how you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="389.74" dur="6.39">need a wall for any of this now we know</text>
  <text start="393.22" dur="5.88">that Yates and clapper they testified</text>
  <text start="396.13" dur="6.71">yesterday and both Yates and clapper</text>
  <text start="399.1" dur="7.22">they said absolutely nothing and</text>
  <text start="402.84" dur="5.41">actually showed no proof whatsoever</text>
  <text start="406.32" dur="3.58">there was nothing really</text>
  <text start="408.25" dur="5.19">accomplished by this whole entire thing</text>
  <text start="409.9" dur="7.17">and what we are seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="413.44" dur="6.24">the bigger question right now is how did</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="4.8">these leaks occur who did the unmasking</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="5.64">because those things are actually</text>
  <text start="421.87" dur="8.13">against the law so as of right now there</text>
  <text start="425.32" dur="6.36">is no proof that Trump and Russia were</text>
  <text start="430" dur="4.62">colluding with each other they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="431.68" dur="7.2">produce anything so one thing that did</text>
  <text start="434.62" dur="7.35">come out is when Yates was asked the</text>
  <text start="438.88" dur="5.52">same question as clapper whether clapper</text>
  <text start="441.97" dur="4.65">had ever leaped either classified or</text>
  <text start="444.4" dur="4.92">unclassified information to the media he</text>
  <text start="446.62" dur="5.31">asserted he had not when asked the same</text>
  <text start="449.32" dur="4.58">question to Yates she had spoken to</text>
  <text start="451.93" dur="4.4">reporters on background and</text>
  <text start="453.9" dur="4.2">per said he had done the same but that</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="4.8">did not include sharing classified</text>
  <text start="458.1" dur="5.61">information now they just admitted that</text>
  <text start="461.13" dur="5.94">they didn&amp;#39;t leak classified information</text>
  <text start="463.71" dur="7.23">if the White House has documentation</text>
  <text start="467.07" dur="6.71">that says the opposite well guess what</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="5.099">they lied in front of Congress and</text>
  <text start="473.78" dur="4.69">they&amp;#39;re going to be in big trouble for</text>
  <text start="476.039" dur="6.091">that and I think this is why Trump was</text>
  <text start="478.47" dur="4.949">out there setting Yates up by asked her</text>
  <text start="482.13" dur="4.319">this question asked her this question</text>
  <text start="483.419" dur="6.181">because I think they might have actual</text>
  <text start="486.449" dur="4.831">paperwork that shows that yes they did</text>
  <text start="489.6" dur="3.18">leak this information or they have some</text>
  <text start="491.28" dur="1.889">type of proof but we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and</text>
  <text start="492.78" dur="3.21">see</text>
  <text start="493.169" dur="4.921">now Judicial Watch is stepping in and</text>
  <text start="495.99" dur="3.899">they announced today that it has filed a</text>
  <text start="498.09" dur="3.57">Freedom of Information Act lawsuit</text>
  <text start="499.889" dur="3.981">against the US Department of Justice for</text>
  <text start="501.66" dur="4.95">emails of former acting Attorney General</text>
  <text start="503.87" dur="6.94">Sally Yates from her government account</text>
  <text start="506.61" dur="7.559">and they want all her emails to track</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="6.27">down exactly when what went on during</text>
  <text start="514.169" dur="5.37">this period with Flynn and everything</text>
  <text start="517.08" dur="4.709">else now are they going to receive these</text>
  <text start="519.539" dur="4.56">emails what we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see</text>
  <text start="521.789" dur="5.761">but we can see that most of the time</text>
  <text start="524.099" dur="5.761">Judicial Watch does get what they want</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="3.96">now when Trump came into office many</text>
  <text start="529.86" dur="3.63">people were saying you know why did</text>
  <text start="531.51" dur="4.019">Trump keep call me on because we know</text>
  <text start="533.49" dur="3.99">that call me was covering for Hillary</text>
  <text start="535.529" dur="5.161">Clinton and no one really could</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="6.06">understand it well it looks like Trump</text>
  <text start="540.69" dur="5.6">just had enough of Comey right now he</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="6.51">basically said you are fired and he is</text>
  <text start="546.29" dur="5.29">terminating coaming he informed FBI</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="3.87">director James Comey that he has been</text>
  <text start="551.58" dur="4.71">terminated and removed from office</text>
  <text start="553.92" dur="4.08">Trump acted based on the clear</text>
  <text start="556.29" dur="4.32">recommendation from both Deputy Attorney</text>
  <text start="558" dur="5.339">General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="5.01">General Jeff Sessions and we can see</text>
  <text start="563.339" dur="5.511">right now that he basically said that</text>
  <text start="565.62" dur="6.36">Comey cannot effectively lead the FBI</text>
  <text start="568.85" dur="6.88">new leadership is needed to restore</text>
  <text start="571.98" dur="8.16">trust and he should have done this right</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="6.39">from the beginning now out in France we</text>
  <text start="580.14" dur="5.13">understand that Makram he won the</text>
  <text start="582.12" dur="4.74">election but marine lepen she is out</text>
  <text start="585.27" dur="4.08">there saying that when</text>
  <text start="586.86" dur="5.25">well something is wrong with the</text>
  <text start="589.35" dur="4.95">elections and she&amp;#39;s saying they might</text>
  <text start="592.11" dur="5.28">have been rigged now we know this was</text>
  <text start="594.3" dur="6.39">done using paper ballots now in France</text>
  <text start="597.39" dur="6.39">and this is very important if a ballot</text>
  <text start="600.69" dur="6.03">is damaged it cannot be cast and what</text>
  <text start="603.78" dur="5.28">happened was up to one third of the</text>
  <text start="606.72" dur="6.03">ballots sent out to voters an estimated</text>
  <text start="609.06" dur="6.66">60% of the pens ballots were destroyed</text>
  <text start="612.75" dur="5.85">at the time of mailing now I don&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="6.33">burnt up I don&amp;#39;t mean discarded I mean</text>
  <text start="618.6" dur="5.94">they were ripped if they are ripped they</text>
  <text start="622.05" dur="6.06">cannot be used and they cannot use them</text>
  <text start="624.54" dur="5.88">and they arrived in this state when</text>
  <text start="628.11" dur="3.72">people open up their envelopes this is</text>
  <text start="630.42" dur="3.03">what they look like they look like they</text>
  <text start="631.83" dur="3.39">had a little tear in them and it looks</text>
  <text start="633.45" dur="4.59">like the tears are in all different</text>
  <text start="635.22" dur="5.73">places and it looks like it was done by</text>
  <text start="638.04" dur="6.03">individuals and this is one way to</text>
  <text start="640.95" dur="4.86">manipulate an election because we know</text>
  <text start="644.07" dur="3.03">that everything was being done by paper</text>
  <text start="645.81" dur="4.14">ballots we knew they were using clear</text>
  <text start="647.1" dur="4.23">boxes and we knew that they were going</text>
  <text start="649.95" dur="2.97">to have to manipulate it in one way or</text>
  <text start="651.33" dur="3.84">another because they couldn&amp;#39;t blame</text>
  <text start="652.92" dur="4.79">Russia and cyber attacking the election</text>
  <text start="655.17" dur="4.8">system because it wasn&amp;#39;t being done</text>
  <text start="657.71" dur="4.36">electronically so they had to figure out</text>
  <text start="659.97" dur="3.99">a new way of doing it and it looks like</text>
  <text start="662.07" dur="4.32">this is what they have done</text>
  <text start="663.96" dur="4.83">now tensions they are definitely rising</text>
  <text start="666.39" dur="5.07">in Venezuela and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="668.79" dur="4.92">about this we know that Marco Rubio he</text>
  <text start="671.46" dur="4.5">decided to push forth this bill that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="673.71" dur="5.13">going to basically fund a regime change</text>
  <text start="675.96" dur="4.59">in Venezuela and we also have something</text>
  <text start="678.84" dur="3.93">else happening at the same exact time</text>
  <text start="680.55" dur="4.26">three South American countries are</text>
  <text start="682.77" dur="5.97">preparing to hold a large military drill</text>
  <text start="684.81" dur="5.91">near Venezuela later this year now</text>
  <text start="688.74" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s going to be the involvement of</text>
  <text start="690.72" dur="6.72">the US military in this drill and this</text>
  <text start="693.54" dur="7.8">raises concerns about the u.s. the US</text>
  <text start="697.44" dur="5.79">has true intentions in the area are they</text>
  <text start="701.34" dur="4.05">bringing the military up to this area</text>
  <text start="703.23" dur="5.61">because they know that there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="705.39" dur="5.18">be regime change at this point and this</text>
  <text start="708.84" dur="3.21">is where it gets really interesting</text>
  <text start="710.57" dur="3.97">remember Michelle</text>
  <text start="712.05" dur="6.36">temer who was put into place who was</text>
  <text start="714.54" dur="6.72">unelected because Rousseff was removed</text>
  <text start="718.41" dur="5.94">from her post because of certain</text>
  <text start="721.26" dur="5.97">allegations about different things that</text>
  <text start="724.35" dur="6.09">went on in her presidency and we know</text>
  <text start="727.23" dur="5.76">that this individual temer well</text>
  <text start="730.44" dur="7.86">basically the United States controls</text>
  <text start="732.99" dur="9.06">this person and Brazil invited the u.s.</text>
  <text start="738.3" dur="4.92">to participate in these drills and we</text>
  <text start="742.05" dur="2.79">have to remember the US has funneled</text>
  <text start="743.22" dur="4.41">millions into Venezuelan opposition</text>
  <text start="744.84" dur="6.27">parties since they failed us-led kuis</text>
  <text start="747.63" dur="5.76">Chavez in 2002 they&amp;#39;ve spent between 50</text>
  <text start="751.11" dur="3.96">and 60 million since that point to have</text>
  <text start="753.39" dur="3.54">regime change and now they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="755.07" dur="5.13">add another 10 million because of</text>
  <text start="756.93" dur="6.09">Rubio&amp;#39;s bill if that is passed so we can</text>
  <text start="760.2" dur="6.09">see that it looks like they&amp;#39;re on track</text>
  <text start="763.02" dur="6">to have regime change in Venezuela now</text>
  <text start="766.29" dur="4.98">out in Syria it looks like the Arab</text>
  <text start="769.02" dur="3.54">League well they had a change of heart</text>
  <text start="771.27" dur="4.5">right now they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="772.56" dur="5.73">not going to suspend Syria&amp;#39;s membership</text>
  <text start="775.77" dur="5.07">any more that is now canceled they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="778.29" dur="6.51">going to allow them to remain now we</text>
  <text start="780.84" dur="6.3">know that Russia and Syria Iran Turkey</text>
  <text start="784.8" dur="4.74">they set up this no-fly zone now the</text>
  <text start="787.14" dur="5.04">Pentagon is out there saying listen we</text>
  <text start="789.54" dur="5.55">will fly our planes anywhere we want we</text>
  <text start="792.18" dur="5.13">will hit any target that we need to hit</text>
  <text start="795.09" dur="3.75">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what Russia says it</text>
  <text start="797.31" dur="3.48">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what Syria says and</text>
  <text start="798.84" dur="4.08">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all this</text>
  <text start="800.79" dur="4.23">is that the United States is in a</text>
  <text start="802.92" dur="4.41">sovereign country with an elected</text>
  <text start="805.02" dur="5.03">president they were not invited into</text>
  <text start="807.33" dur="5.79">this country and they are telling this</text>
  <text start="810.05" dur="5.47">president and the country that they can</text>
  <text start="813.12" dur="5.22">fly their planes anywhere they want and</text>
  <text start="815.52" dur="5.31">destroy any target they want well</text>
  <text start="818.34" dur="5.07">actually no they really can&amp;#39;t and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="820.83" dur="5.88">very worrisome about all of this is if</text>
  <text start="823.41" dur="5.4">they attempt to do this and Syria or</text>
  <text start="826.71" dur="4.23">Russia one of their systems locks on and</text>
  <text start="828.81" dur="5.04">knocks one of their jets out of the sky</text>
  <text start="830.94" dur="6.45">we are then moving into World War 3 now</text>
  <text start="833.85" dur="6.87">is this all talk most likely but we can</text>
  <text start="837.39" dur="5.49">see right now that the deep state they</text>
  <text start="840.72" dur="4.2">want they what they want and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="842.88" dur="5.07">want to be told that they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="844.92" dur="5.94">something in a sovereign country where</text>
  <text start="847.95" dur="4.28">basically they invaded now the corporate</text>
  <text start="850.86" dur="5.09">media is out there and there</text>
  <text start="852.23" dur="4.98">using another anonymous source to let</text>
  <text start="855.95" dur="3.24">everyone know what the Trump</text>
  <text start="857.21" dur="3.36">administration is doing they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="859.19" dur="4.11">that the Trump administration has</text>
  <text start="860.57" dur="5.94">approved heavier weapons for the Syrian</text>
  <text start="863.3" dur="6.54">Kurds to support efforts to retake Raqqa</text>
  <text start="866.51" dur="6.36">from the Islamic state and can we really</text>
  <text start="869.84" dur="5.78">believe this at this point we cannot</text>
  <text start="872.87" dur="5.37">because nothing can be confirmed</text>
  <text start="875.62" dur="5.47">basically this is just out there telling</text>
  <text start="878.24" dur="5.16">everyone that this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="881.09" dur="4.56">and we could see that most likely this</text>
  <text start="883.4" dur="4.29">is coming from the deep state and this</text>
  <text start="885.65" dur="4.47">is being run from the Pentagon from the</text>
  <text start="887.69" dur="5.37">CIA where they want to bring in more</text>
  <text start="890.12" dur="5.07">weapons into this area because as I see</text>
  <text start="893.06" dur="3.69">it right now even though Trump is</text>
  <text start="895.19" dur="3.63">teetering back and forth and leaning</text>
  <text start="896.75" dur="3.06">more toward the deep side even though he</text>
  <text start="898.82" dur="3.72">just fired Comey</text>
  <text start="899.81" dur="5.76">which is a bright light in a very dark</text>
  <text start="902.54" dur="5.58">tunnel we can see that the deep state</text>
  <text start="905.57" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re still using tricks to convince</text>
  <text start="908.12" dur="5.4">us that this is the way it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="911.3" dur="4.83">happening and then it turns out that it</text>
  <text start="913.52" dur="5.13">really isn&amp;#39;t so we need to watch this</text>
  <text start="916.13" dur="4.83">very very carefully because we have to</text>
  <text start="918.65" dur="5.37">understand that Trump fired 59 missiles</text>
  <text start="920.96" dur="4.41">into Syria and the corporate media was</text>
  <text start="924.02" dur="3.96">out there telling us that troops are</text>
  <text start="925.37" dur="4.44">being ready to be maneuvered in we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="927.98" dur="3.99">going to be invading and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="929.81" dur="3.48">be going into North Korea and all this</text>
  <text start="931.97" dur="3.51">information that they&amp;#39;ve been throwing</text>
  <text start="933.29" dur="4.14">at us really turned out to be fake the</text>
  <text start="935.48" dur="4.62">three aircraft carriers are headed</text>
  <text start="937.43" dur="4.59">towards North Korea and we could see</text>
  <text start="940.1" dur="4.77">that most of this stuff turns out to be</text>
  <text start="942.02" dur="4.86">fake you know China was amassing 150,000</text>
  <text start="944.87" dur="4.5">troops on the border Russia was doing</text>
  <text start="946.88" dur="6.36">the same and all of this turned out to</text>
  <text start="949.37" dur="6.39">be completely fake news to push their</text>
  <text start="953.24" dur="5.22">agenda to make us think we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="955.76" dur="4.95">war I mean they still want war but</text>
  <text start="958.46" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re trying to build it up just like</text>
  <text start="960.71" dur="4.59">we build up on North Korea where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="963.29" dur="4.17">keep saying that they&amp;#39;re testing nuclear</text>
  <text start="965.3" dur="4.44">weapons and so far they haven&amp;#39;t shown us</text>
  <text start="967.46" dur="6.03">any proof now again we&amp;#39;re getting this</text>
  <text start="969.74" dur="6.42">from another anonymous source and it</text>
  <text start="973.49" dur="5.91">doesn&amp;#39;t fit into the pattern of what</text>
  <text start="976.16" dur="5.4">Trump is doing and even though we see</text>
  <text start="979.4" dur="5.46">that he delayed the climate meeting even</text>
  <text start="981.56" dur="4.44">though that he&amp;#39;s negotiating NAFTA he</text>
  <text start="984.86" dur="4.47">still hasn&amp;#39;t made</text>
  <text start="986" dur="5.91">a final decision he has made a final</text>
  <text start="989.33" dur="4.86">decision with Co me which he just fired</text>
  <text start="991.91" dur="4.92">because Co me was working with the deep</text>
  <text start="994.19" dur="5.31">state so we are still looking at all</text>
  <text start="996.83" dur="5.73">these indicators to where he actually</text>
  <text start="999.5" dur="6.02">really stands now something very</text>
  <text start="1002.56" dur="7.26">interesting they keep bringing up the</text>
  <text start="1005.52" dur="6.94">idea that North Korea is going to hit us</text>
  <text start="1009.82" dur="4.59">with an EMP they have satellites flying</text>
  <text start="1012.46" dur="5.58">in space right now where they have the</text>
  <text start="1014.41" dur="6.24">ability to basically shoot down an EMP</text>
  <text start="1018.04" dur="5.04">wave into the u.s. and knock out the</text>
  <text start="1020.65" dur="3.799">power infrastructure others are saying</text>
  <text start="1023.08" dur="4.17">that they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="1024.449" dur="5.37">cyberattack the u.s. power grid and</text>
  <text start="1027.25" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re continually bringing this up</text>
  <text start="1029.819" dur="5.051">saying that North Korea is getting ready</text>
  <text start="1032.65" dur="5.189">to do this and every time I hear this</text>
  <text start="1034.87" dur="5.55">type of news I think that the deep state</text>
  <text start="1037.839" dur="4.531">they have already planned to do this and</text>
  <text start="1040.42" dur="5.22">to blame this on North Korea and like I</text>
  <text start="1042.37" dur="7.02">said they had been planning and pushing</text>
  <text start="1045.64" dur="7.23">a main event to get this war started and</text>
  <text start="1049.39" dur="6.78">what better way to do this by pushing</text>
  <text start="1052.87" dur="5.07">their agenda by knocking out certain</text>
  <text start="1056.17" dur="4.35">parts of the power grid and this is what</text>
  <text start="1057.94" dur="4.8">I do believe back in 2003 is what they</text>
  <text start="1060.52" dur="4.86">were doing where they were testing to</text>
  <text start="1062.74" dur="5.52">see if they had the ability to bring</text>
  <text start="1065.38" dur="5.52">down parts of the power grid and they</text>
  <text start="1068.26" dur="5.61">were able to bring down the East Coast</text>
  <text start="1070.9" dur="4.77">for a couple of days and I believe this</text>
  <text start="1073.87" dur="3.96">was all being done in purpose everything</text>
  <text start="1075.67" dur="4.38">they do is being done because they</text>
  <text start="1077.83" dur="5.01">planned it well in advance they knew</text>
  <text start="1080.05" dur="4.8">that eventually that they had certain</text>
  <text start="1082.84" dur="3.72">plans and they have multiple all at once</text>
  <text start="1084.85" dur="3.9">where they&amp;#39;re going to use this and like</text>
  <text start="1086.56" dur="4.38">I said from the beginning they will be</text>
  <text start="1088.75" dur="4.5">using some type of cyber tech maybe an</text>
  <text start="1090.94" dur="4.92">EMP to convince us that they just</text>
  <text start="1093.25" dur="3.99">exploded a nuclear weapon even though it</text>
  <text start="1095.86" dur="3.93">really wasn&amp;#39;t coming from North Korea</text>
  <text start="1097.24" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re going to try to use this type of</text>
  <text start="1099.79" dur="6.81">false flag to convince us to get into</text>
  <text start="1103.24" dur="5.25">war and this is going to be a last-ditch</text>
  <text start="1106.6" dur="3.87">attempt if they can&amp;#39;t get anything else</text>
  <text start="1108.49" dur="4.53">done because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1110.47" dur="5.28">nothing else is being done in this area</text>
  <text start="1113.02" dur="5.4">because they have a major problem the</text>
  <text start="1115.75" dur="3.99">president that was just elected in South</text>
  <text start="1118.42" dur="3.42">Korea he</text>
  <text start="1119.74" dur="5.22">wants to have a dialogue with North</text>
  <text start="1121.84" dur="5.16">Korea now most likely they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1124.96" dur="4.65">have maybe some type of an event in</text>
  <text start="1127" dur="5.58">South Korea to try to change the South</text>
  <text start="1129.61" dur="5.069">Korean a president&amp;#39;s mind and this is</text>
  <text start="1132.58" dur="5.69">what we are looking at right now because</text>
  <text start="1134.679" dur="6.121">we can see that at this point they are</text>
  <text start="1138.27" dur="6.37">desperate they need to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="1140.8" dur="6.12">and they are running out of time because</text>
  <text start="1144.64" dur="4.01">we can see right now in Syria this whole</text>
  <text start="1146.92" dur="4.37">strategy and Syria for these</text>
  <text start="1148.65" dur="6.97">de-escalation zones is to basically</text>
  <text start="1151.29" dur="7.45">protect the West part portion of Syria</text>
  <text start="1155.62" dur="5.37">and then to drive east and to get rid of</text>
  <text start="1158.74" dur="4.38">the Islamic state once and for all</text>
  <text start="1160.99" dur="4.05">to get rid of the United States once and</text>
  <text start="1163.12" dur="3.18">for all and we can see this is part of</text>
  <text start="1165.04" dur="2.55">the strategy and this is what the United</text>
  <text start="1166.3" dur="2.52">States government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="1167.59" dur="3.15">very worried about the deep state that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1168.82" dur="4.41">what they&amp;#39;re worried about about all of</text>
  <text start="1170.74" dur="4.74">this and we could see out in Syria North</text>
  <text start="1173.23" dur="3.81">Korea things are really not going well</text>
  <text start="1175.48" dur="3.12">for them so they are going to become</text>
  <text start="1177.04" dur="4.29">very very desperate they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1178.6" dur="4.5">push their agenda and most likely we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1181.33" dur="4.74">going to see an event because we can see</text>
  <text start="1183.1" dur="6.45">right now that the economy it is</text>
  <text start="1186.07" dur="6.57">breaking down JP Morgan already warned</text>

  <text start="1194.44" dur="6.84">preparing for a balun and we see right</text>
