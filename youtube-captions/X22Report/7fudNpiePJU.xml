  <text start="72.47" dur="4.95">with the travel ban with Trump it looks</text>
  <text start="75.229" dur="4.191">like Trump and his staff decided that</text>
  <text start="77.42" dur="5.489">they were going to create a whole new</text>
  <text start="79.42" dur="6.16">travel type of ban and Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="82.909" dur="5.221">Secretary John Kelly well he previewed</text>

  <text start="88.13" dur="4.529">Munich Security Conference gathering</text>
  <text start="90.259" dur="5.31">that the travel ban will no longer stop</text>

  <text start="110.95" dur="5.89">we can see that it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="113.509" dur="6.11">because the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="116.84" dur="5.989">bankers the establishment those in power</text>

  <text start="122.829" dur="6.611">now Trump has been leaking information</text>
  <text start="126.43" dur="5.649">out of the White House and he was doing</text>
  <text start="129.44" dur="4.68">this on purpose the drafts that were</text>
  <text start="132.079" dur="4.981">being leaked out certain information</text>
  <text start="134.12" dur="7.05">that was being leaked out it was all</text>
  <text start="137.06" dur="8.76">being done on purpose he wanted to flush</text>
  <text start="141.17" dur="7.5">out the leakers and expose them just</text>
  <text start="145.82" dur="5.19">like he&amp;#39;s going to expose the central</text>
  <text start="148.67" dur="5.4">bankers the corporate media of how the</text>
  <text start="151.01" dur="5.91">economy&amp;#39;s really doing and he already</text>
  <text start="154.07" dur="4.77">set that in motion coming out of got</text>
  <text start="156.92" dur="5.789">news we see that the White House deputy</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="6.42">chief of staff and hashtag never Trump</text>
  <text start="162.709" dur="6">Republican Katie Walsh has been</text>
  <text start="165.26" dur="5.009">identified as the source behind a bunch</text>
  <text start="168.709" dur="3.81">of leaks from the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="170.269" dur="4.351">to the New York Times and other media</text>
  <text start="172.519" dur="4.31">outlets now this is according to</text>
  <text start="174.62" dur="6.109">multiple sources in the White House and</text>
  <text start="176.829" dur="5.77">we can see right now that everyone knows</text>
  <text start="180.729" dur="3.251">not to talk to</text>
  <text start="182.599" dur="4.56">in the White House unless you want to</text>
  <text start="183.98" dur="5.729">see it in the press and the only</text>
  <text start="187.159" dur="5.7">question is whether or not she&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="189.709" dur="5.4">it at the behest of the White House</text>
  <text start="192.859" dur="5.46">chief of staff Priebus or if she&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="195.109" dur="6.391">it to advance herself in the DC media</text>
  <text start="198.319" dur="5.79">circles and Walsh is referred to as</text>
  <text start="201.5" dur="4.709">Madam President in the White House says</text>
  <text start="204.109" dur="5.49">a senior aide and it isn&amp;#39;t a compliment</text>
  <text start="206.209" dur="7.17">and we can see right now that Trump at</text>
  <text start="209.599" dur="6.661">this point is deliberately feeding her</text>
  <text start="213.379" dur="5.881">fake information and actually feeding</text>
  <text start="216.26" dur="5.909">others fake information and by doing</text>
  <text start="219.26" dur="6.119">this he knows exactly where the leaks</text>
  <text start="222.169" dur="5.611">originate and he knows exactly who the</text>
  <text start="225.379" dur="4.98">individuals are and this is an ongoing</text>
  <text start="227.78" dur="4.319">thing right now now Paul Craig Roberts</text>
  <text start="230.359" dur="3.99">is out there and he&amp;#39;s explaining the</text>
  <text start="232.099" dur="4.59">stakes for Trump and all of us and we</text>
  <text start="234.349" dur="4.56">have to understand the war on terror we</text>
  <text start="236.689" dur="4.26">know was a complete hoax that was to</text>
  <text start="238.909" dur="7.021">transform the intelligence Eze such as</text>
  <text start="240.949" dur="8.731">the NSA CIA FBI into the Gestapo secret</text>
  <text start="245.93" dur="5.369">police agency and to push war out into</text>
  <text start="249.68" dur="3.66">these regions to go into these countries</text>
  <text start="251.299" dur="4.951">have regime change to keep the</text>
  <text start="253.34" dur="6.179">petrodollar the dollar within these</text>
  <text start="256.25" dur="7.86">countries where they use it on their oil</text>
  <text start="259.519" dur="6.39">sales and Trump right now is threatened</text>
  <text start="264.11" dur="4.559">by these agencies because he rejects the</text>
  <text start="265.909" dur="5.121">neoconservative agenda that supports the</text>
  <text start="268.669" dur="5.761">military-industrial complex and the</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="6.419">military security annual budget now</text>
  <text start="274.43" dur="6.69">Glenn Greenwald is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="277.449" dur="6.431">Trump&amp;#39;s policies of reducing tensions</text>
  <text start="281.12" dur="6.24">between Russia conflicts with this</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="6.81">military security complex and at this</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="6.63">point Trump has no alternative but to</text>
  <text start="290.69" dur="6.09">fight because they&amp;#39;re gonna either take</text>
  <text start="293.99" dur="6.209">him down or he&amp;#39;s gonna have to figure</text>
  <text start="296.78" dur="5.97">out a way to take them down and this is</text>
  <text start="300.199" dur="6.831">where we are at this point where we have</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="7.08">this war between the administration and</text>
  <text start="307.03" dur="6.04">these agencies that have been empowered</text>
  <text start="309.83" dur="5.79">for a very long time and things are</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="3.33">going to get worse way before they get</text>
  <text start="315.62" dur="2.37">better</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="5.36">because we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="317.99" dur="8.82">Obama he is behind this soft coup and</text>
  <text start="321.76" dur="7.689">this soft coup is underway and Obama is</text>
  <text start="326.81" dur="4.889">tied to activist group training tens of</text>
  <text start="329.449" dur="5.19">thousands of agitators to protest</text>
  <text start="331.699" dur="4.981">Trump&amp;#39;s policies and we can see that</text>
  <text start="334.639" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re out there every so often you</text>
  <text start="336.68" dur="6.14">know pushing their agenda and he put out</text>
  <text start="339.949" dur="6.361">a manual published with the ofa partner</text>
  <text start="342.82" dur="6.49">indivisible advisers protesters to go</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="5.639">into halls quietly so as not to raise</text>
  <text start="349.31" dur="5.729">alarms grab seats at the front of the</text>
  <text start="351.949" dur="5.311">room but do not all sit together spread</text>
  <text start="355.039" dur="7.35">out in the audience so it looks like</text>
  <text start="357.26" dur="7.43">everyone is against Trump this will help</text>
  <text start="362.389" dur="4.5">reinforce the impression of broad</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="4.69">consensus and they&amp;#39;ve created this</text>
  <text start="366.889" dur="7.621">manual that tells these individuals on</text>
  <text start="369.38" dur="8.64">how to do all of this a script advises</text>
  <text start="374.51" dur="5.719">callers to complain I&amp;#39;m honestly scared</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="4.709">that a known racist and an anti-semite</text>
  <text start="380.229" dur="5.381">will be working just feet from the Oval</text>
  <text start="382.729" dur="5.25">Office it is everyone&amp;#39;s business if a</text>
  <text start="385.61" dur="5.01">man who promoted white supremacy is</text>
  <text start="387.979" dur="6.601">serving as an advisor to the president</text>
  <text start="390.62" dur="5.58">this is for Bannen progressive groups</text>
  <text start="394.58" dur="4.05">are circulating information about town</text>
  <text start="396.2" dur="6.24">hall meetings on moveon.org</text>
  <text start="398.63" dur="8.52">and this is sources one of his funded</text>
  <text start="402.44" dur="8.55">groups and Obama is behind the civil</text>
  <text start="407.15" dur="6.42">unrest because he&amp;#39;s taken to Twitter and</text>
  <text start="410.99" dur="3.959">he states boldly to believe in that the</text>
  <text start="413.57" dur="4.2">people can bring about change through</text>
  <text start="414.949" dur="5.731">their own action he&amp;#39;s employing to rise</text>
  <text start="417.77" dur="3.51">up and create civil unrest on a massive</text>
  <text start="420.68" dur="3.03">scale</text>
  <text start="421.28" dur="5.009">and this goes along with the ex CIA</text>
  <text start="423.71" dur="4.53">operative who says who&amp;#39;s Robert Steele</text>
  <text start="426.289" dur="3.871">who says come May first and we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="428.24" dur="4.23">to see if this actually happens they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="430.16" dur="5.58">planning on tens of millions of people</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="6.54">paid agitators to go out onto the street</text>
  <text start="435.74" dur="7.109">and to have civil unrest to create a</text>
  <text start="439.01" dur="6">civil war now again do we know this is</text>
  <text start="442.849" dur="4.201">going to happen no this is a warning</text>
  <text start="445.01" dur="4.86">saying this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="447.05" dur="3.88">but when we look at the central banks</text>
  <text start="449.87" dur="4.24">the deeps</text>
  <text start="450.93" dur="5.37">we can see with the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="4.98">are pushing their agenda as hard as they</text>
  <text start="456.3" dur="4.35">possibly can they do not want someone</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="4.799">they can&amp;#39;t control in the White House</text>
  <text start="460.65" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s completely obvious and we see</text>
  <text start="463.889" dur="4.731">already that they&amp;#39;re out there trying to</text>
  <text start="465.78" dur="5.84">push and invoke the 25th amendment and</text>
  <text start="468.62" dur="5.889">they&amp;#39;re saying unless Trump gets a grip</text>
  <text start="471.62" dur="7.12">well we might have to invoke the 25th</text>
  <text start="474.509" dur="7.62">amendment and we can see that there is</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="6.69">many Republicans Democrats all saying</text>
  <text start="482.129" dur="7.26">the same thing now they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="485.43" dur="5.519">article 4 to the 25th amendment and in</text>
  <text start="489.389" dur="3.33">the abstract the amendment itself is</text>
  <text start="490.949" dur="4.081">about presidential succession and</text>
  <text start="492.719" dur="4.41">includes language about the power of the</text>
  <text start="495.03" dur="5.33">office when a president is incapacitated</text>
  <text start="497.129" dur="5.731">and what they&amp;#39;re talking about is a</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="4.51">specific text that they&amp;#39;re referring to</text>
  <text start="502.86" dur="3.54">is whenever the vice president and a</text>
  <text start="504.87" dur="4.109">majority of either the principal</text>
  <text start="506.4" dur="4.769">officers of the executive departments or</text>
  <text start="508.979" dur="5.011">if such other body as Congress may by</text>
  <text start="511.169" dur="5.25">law provide transmit to the president</text>
  <text start="513.99" dur="4.289">pro tempore of the Senate and the</text>
  <text start="516.419" dur="3.211">Speaker of the House of Representatives</text>
  <text start="518.279" dur="3.661">their written declaration that the</text>
  <text start="519.63" dur="3.75">president is unable to discharge the</text>
  <text start="521.94" dur="3.36">powers and duties of his office</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="4.019">the vice president shall immediately</text>
  <text start="525.3" dur="4.02">assume the powers and duties of the</text>
  <text start="527.399" dur="3.18">office as Acting President so what does</text>
  <text start="529.32" dur="4.38">all this mean exactly</text>
  <text start="530.579" dur="5.07">well it means Congress isn&amp;#39;t the only</text>
  <text start="533.7" dur="4.259">institution that can remove a president</text>
  <text start="535.649" dur="5.371">from office between elections under the</text>
  <text start="537.959" dur="5.101">25th amendment a sitting vice president</text>
  <text start="541.02" dur="5.28">and a majority of the executive branches</text>
  <text start="543.06" dur="5.19">cabinet could on their own agree to</text>
  <text start="546.3" dur="3.81">transfer power out of the hands of the</text>
  <text start="548.25" dur="5.339">sitting president and to the vice</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="8.039">president now if Trump decides to argue</text>
  <text start="553.589" dur="7.911">this and you know object to all this</text>
  <text start="558.149" dur="7.321">well then it would go to Congress and</text>
  <text start="561.5" dur="5.949">they would vote on it now we can see</text>
  <text start="565.47" dur="6.03">right now that they&amp;#39;re trying to make it</text>
  <text start="567.449" dur="6.061">seem like the president well he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="571.5" dur="8.339">have all his faculties he&amp;#39;s losing his</text>
  <text start="573.51" dur="9.99">grip he is losing it and he not he might</text>
  <text start="579.839" dur="6.361">not be mentally stable so</text>
  <text start="583.5" dur="6.78">this is why they might have to invoke</text>
  <text start="586.2" dur="6.48">the 25th amendment so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="590.28" dur="6.66">right now in other words is for the</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="7.02">first time the concept of soft palace</text>
  <text start="596.94" dur="4.65">coup has been officially brought up on</text>
  <text start="599.7" dur="4.89">the public meeting now remember the deep</text>
  <text start="601.59" dur="5.85">state the central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="604.59" dur="5.94">bringing this all out into the open to</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="5.91">get the people riled up they are showing</text>
  <text start="610.53" dur="5.79">everyone that listen doesn&amp;#39;t matter what</text>
  <text start="613.35" dur="6.27">the elections call for doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="616.32" dur="6.72">that he won the elections we will make</text>
  <text start="619.62" dur="6.12">the final decision and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="623.04" dur="4.74">show you how we&amp;#39;re going to do it now if</text>
  <text start="625.74" dur="4.31">we can&amp;#39;t get him out of office this way</text>
  <text start="627.78" dur="5.04">and guess what</text>
  <text start="630.05" dur="5.68">we&amp;#39;ll take it to the next level we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="632.82" dur="4.17">have him removed by killing him now of</text>
  <text start="635.73" dur="2.97">course they&amp;#39;re not out there saying that</text>
  <text start="636.99" dur="3.24">but we can see what they tried to do</text>
  <text start="638.7" dur="3.81">with Andrew Jackson they did it with</text>
  <text start="640.23" dur="5.04">Lincoln they did it with John F Kennedy</text>
  <text start="642.51" dur="5.19">they will try to assassinate now Andrew</text>
  <text start="645.27" dur="4.95">Jackson they attempted to assassinate</text>
  <text start="647.7" dur="5.13">him but he survived and he got rid of</text>
  <text start="650.22" dur="5.25">the central bank John F Kennedy not so</text>
  <text start="652.83" dur="4.17">lucky but we can see right now that if</text>
  <text start="655.47" dur="2.88">they can&amp;#39;t get their way remember all</text>
  <text start="657" dur="4.71">the things they&amp;#39;ve tried up to this</text>
  <text start="658.35" dur="6.99">point before he was even put into the</text>
  <text start="661.71" dur="7.4">White House the recount going with B</text>
  <text start="665.34" dur="6.66">cyber attacks with Russia Russia and</text>

  <text start="683.42" dur="6.28">pushed to get him out of office or to</text>
  <text start="687.84" dur="4.7">make it so he can&amp;#39;t get into office now</text>
  <text start="689.7" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;re on the back end he&amp;#39;s in office and</text>
  <text start="692.54" dur="6.16">he has the ability to break this wide</text>
  <text start="696.18" dur="5.13">open and they&amp;#39;re trying to stop him at</text>
  <text start="698.7" dur="4.5">this point and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="701.31" dur="4.62">battle and it&amp;#39;s going to get worse as we</text>
  <text start="703.2" dur="5.31">move throughout this year now we can see</text>
  <text start="705.93" dur="5.61">that the central bankers the elite the</text>
  <text start="708.51" dur="4.35">deep state they&amp;#39;re using the same exact</text>

  <text start="991.23" dur="5.01">this would make people worry because</text>
  <text start="993.63" dur="5.16">they would blame this on North Korea Kim</text>
  <text start="996.24" dur="5.67">jong-un killed his half-brother he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1001.91" dur="5.58">he might just go off and blast them off</text>
  <text start="1004.37" dur="5.25">and you know start a war you can see</text>
  <text start="1007.49" dur="4.92">where this was going and what they were</text>
  <text start="1009.62" dur="6.54">trying to do they&amp;#39;re building a story</text>
  <text start="1012.41" dur="7.77">right now how the leader of North Korea</text>
  <text start="1016.16" dur="6.42">is completely unstable and if he&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="1020.18" dur="4.59">unstable to kill his brother and an</text>
  <text start="1022.58" dur="5.79">airport what is he going to do with</text>
  <text start="1024.77" dur="6.36">nuclear weapons now we can see China</text>
  <text start="1028.37" dur="5.34">they are separating themselves from</text>
  <text start="1031.13" dur="6.21">North Korea because China right now</text>
  <text start="1033.71" dur="6.45">suspended all imports of coal from North</text>
  <text start="1037.34" dur="4.35">Korea as part of its efforts to</text>

  <text start="1041.69" dur="4.95">Council&amp;#39;s sanctions after they came out</text>
  <text start="1044.6" dur="6.69">after North Korea tested their other</text>

  <text start="1051.29" dur="4.71">sales accounted for more than 50 percent</text>
  <text start="1053.15" dur="5.19">of North Korea&amp;#39;s exports to China so</text>
  <text start="1056" dur="5.13">this is going to have a huge impact on</text>
  <text start="1058.34" dur="3.71">the economy of North Korea but at the</text>

  <text start="1071.69" dur="3.72">back Russia actually did the same thing</text>
  <text start="1074.03" dur="4.11">with North Korea because Putin</text>
  <text start="1075.41" dur="5.25">understands that if a war is started</text>
  <text start="1078.14" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to pull Russia China</text>
