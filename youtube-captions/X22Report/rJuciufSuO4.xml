  <text start="73.36" dur="5.429">economic collapse financial news now as</text>
  <text start="75.85" dur="5.58">we can see from the beginning of 2017 to</text>
  <text start="78.789" dur="5.521">this point thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="81.43" dur="5.46">stores have closed hundreds have gone</text>
  <text start="84.31" dur="5.089">bankrupt there are so much more space</text>
  <text start="86.89" dur="6.75">out there strip malls they&amp;#39;re becoming</text>
  <text start="89.399" dur="5.86">you know emptier and emptier and we see</text>
  <text start="93.64" dur="3.119">right now that the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="95.259" dur="3">government numbers they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="96.759" dur="3.75">trying to convince everyone that retail</text>
  <text start="98.259" dur="4.081">sales are doing very very well during</text>
  <text start="100.509" dur="3.961">the holiday season and yes you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="102.34" dur="3.6">get a bump up of sales and during the</text>
  <text start="104.47" dur="3.99">holiday season because people do go out</text>
  <text start="105.94" dur="4.379">and shop but the problem is is that</text>
  <text start="108.46" dur="2.82">there&amp;#39;s not enough people going out and</text>
  <text start="110.319" dur="3.271">shopping there&amp;#39;s not enough people</text>
  <text start="111.28" dur="5.88">spending the amount of money they need</text>
  <text start="113.59" dur="5.039">to stay open and we went back in time to</text>
  <text start="117.16" dur="2.819">this time last year</text>
  <text start="118.629" dur="3.421">where the corporate media was saying</text>
  <text start="119.979" dur="4.62">Black Friday was fantastic Cyber Monday</text>
  <text start="122.05" dur="2.879">incredible stores are doing better than</text>
  <text start="124.599" dur="2.52">ever</text>
  <text start="124.929" dur="4.021">and then during the holiday season</text>
  <text start="127.119" dur="3.48">stores started to close down they</text>
  <text start="128.95" dur="3.869">started to report that sales aren&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="130.599" dur="3.39">great and remember the numbers that the</text>
  <text start="132.819" dur="2.821">government is putting out there the</text>
  <text start="133.989" dur="3.231">numbers that the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="135.64" dur="5.52">putting out there number right now</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="5.2">they&amp;#39;re manipulated their estimates and</text>
  <text start="141.16" dur="2.37">if they don&amp;#39;t like the numbers they get</text>
  <text start="142.42" dur="2.72">from the retails and of course the</text>
  <text start="143.53" dur="4.62">retailers don&amp;#39;t have the numbers in yet</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="7.179">they change them and the stores that are</text>
  <text start="148.15" dur="6.18">closing they spread out those sales over</text>
  <text start="152.319" dur="3.841">the year they don&amp;#39;t just say it it stops</text>
  <text start="154.33" dur="3.81">today there&amp;#39;s no more sales from the</text>
  <text start="156.16" dur="3.84">store if they closed down all their</text>
  <text start="158.14" dur="3.54">stores today they take those sales they</text>
  <text start="160" dur="3.81">spread them out over the year and they</text>
  <text start="161.68" dur="4.23">calculate them to show that yes we are</text>
  <text start="163.81" dur="3.99">still very very strong in the retail</text>
  <text start="165.91" dur="3.9">industry and we&amp;#39;ve been showing that</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people being laid off</text>
  <text start="169.81" dur="5.7">and of course the BLS is not really</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="5.759">showing this because remember the way</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="4.559">they calculate jobs if you have a</text>
  <text start="178.209" dur="3.991">part-time job you&amp;#39;re automatically</text>
  <text start="180.069" dur="5.071">counted as having a full-time job if you</text>
  <text start="182.2" dur="3.869">lose that part-time job the calculation</text>
  <text start="185.14" dur="4.739">well it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="186.069" dur="6.06">different are you working over 30 hours</text>
  <text start="189.879" dur="3.961">a week in each state is different did</text>
  <text start="192.129" dur="3.42">you make a certain amount of money each</text>
  <text start="193.84" dur="3.539">state is different and if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="195.549" dur="4.34">well then you&amp;#39;re a part-time job and</text>
  <text start="197.379" dur="5.45">they don&amp;#39;t count that as a loss if</text>
  <text start="199.889" dur="5.141">you&amp;#39;re making over a certain amount and</text>
  <text start="202.829" dur="3.49">you&amp;#39;re working a certain number of hours</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="5.549">then they count it as a loss so you can</text>
  <text start="206.319" dur="7.111">see how this can change and skew the</text>
  <text start="210.579" dur="6.571">stats and this is what they have done</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="6.36">now the retail industry meltdown is</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="7.319">hitting women very hard now a lot of</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="6.24">women hold jobs in retail and women&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.469" dur="4.321">and this is what this is according to</text>
  <text start="226.03" dur="5.34">Women&amp;#39;s policy research women have lost</text>
  <text start="228.79" dur="7.44">about a hundred and twenty nine thousand</text>
  <text start="231.37" dur="6.899">retail positions in the last year and we</text>
  <text start="236.23" dur="5.58">can see that this is going to continue</text>
  <text start="238.269" dur="5.61">this trend is going to continue as we</text>
  <text start="241.81" dur="3.989">move forward because we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="243.879" dur="4.5">lot more stores closed because as we can</text>
  <text start="245.799" dur="4.53">see as more and more people lose their</text>
  <text start="248.379" dur="3.841">job as more and more people try to get</text>
  <text start="250.329" dur="5.16">part-time jobs or can&amp;#39;t find jobs they</text>
  <text start="252.22" dur="5.97">just don&amp;#39;t make the funds to pay for the</text>
  <text start="255.489" dur="5.131">goods wages are declining sales are</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="4.319">declining credit card debt is at its</text>
  <text start="260.62" dur="4.019">highest point we&amp;#39;ve ever seen which</text>
  <text start="262.509" dur="4.621">means a lot of people are at their</text>
  <text start="264.639" dur="4.321">maximum of what they can spend on their</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="5.219">credit cards and this makes it very</text>
  <text start="268.96" dur="6.84">difficult for individuals families to</text>
  <text start="272.349" dur="5.31">make ends meet to buy gifts and it makes</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="3.72">it very difficult to move forward</text>
  <text start="277.659" dur="5.581">because they&amp;#39;re still looking for those</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="5.82">jobs they still want a full-time job</text>
  <text start="283.24" dur="4.89">they still want a high paying job</text>
  <text start="285.34" dur="7.29">because who doesn&amp;#39;t want to make money</text>
  <text start="288.13" dur="6.599">to go on vacation to make sure you can</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="4.86">pay all your bills to make sure that you</text>
  <text start="294.729" dur="4.25">can pay your rent or mortgage to make</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="4.56">sure that you can live comfortably</text>
  <text start="298.979" dur="6.341">everyone wants this nobody wants to sit</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="4.98">there under a bridge or be poor and be</text>
  <text start="305.32" dur="4.89">thrown out of their apartment or their</text>
  <text start="307.03" dur="7.109">house or worry every single day to try</text>
  <text start="310.21" dur="5.819">to make ends meet and their idea of you</text>
  <text start="314.139" dur="4.14">know them telling us that oh these</text>
  <text start="316.029" dur="3.971">people just don&amp;#39;t want to work it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.279" dur="3.521">absolutely ridiculous because we</text>
  <text start="320" dur="3.66">to remember the way they figure it out</text>
  <text start="321.8" dur="3.45">is if you haven&amp;#39;t been an onion if you</text>
  <text start="323.66" dur="2.07">haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview in four</text>
  <text start="325.25" dur="2.67">weeks</text>
  <text start="325.73" dur="4.92">you&amp;#39;re just not counted as looking for a</text>
  <text start="327.92" dur="5.49">job anymore so you could see how they</text>
  <text start="330.65" dur="4.38">skew everything to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="333.41" dur="3.75">alive and you need to look through this</text>
  <text start="335.03" dur="5.94">illusion to see what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="337.16" dur="6.15">here now let&amp;#39;s take home sales and home</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="6">builders now home builders right now</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="8.72">their optimism is sky-high it&amp;#39;s reached</text>
  <text start="346.97" dur="7.89">the point of where it was back in 2008</text>
  <text start="352.03" dur="6.52">now this is very interesting because</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="6.09">during that period of time when we look</text>
  <text start="358.55" dur="5.31">at this home builder optimism was</text>
  <text start="360.95" dur="6.96">continually moving up and up and up and</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="9.24">at the same time the average Joe home</text>
  <text start="367.91" dur="8.73">buying conditions was dropping we are</text>
  <text start="373.1" dur="6.84">now seeing the same exact pattern that</text>
  <text start="376.64" dur="7.74">we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past and what this</text>
  <text start="379.94" dur="7.68">means is is that guess what the housing</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="5.49">market is coming down affordability is</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="5.85">now out of the reach of many individuals</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="5.7">if you&amp;#39;re losing your job you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="393.47" dur="4.02">making the same amount of money if you</text>
  <text start="395.57" dur="2.82">have a part-time one or two or three</text>
  <text start="397.49" dur="3.51">part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="398.39" dur="4.68">you&amp;#39;re not going to purchase a home if</text>
  <text start="401" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;re graduating college and you have a</text>
  <text start="403.07" dur="4.05">huge student loan and you can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="405.26" dur="3.719">that high paying job and you&amp;#39;re living</text>
  <text start="407.12" dur="5.52">with your parents you&amp;#39;re not going out</text>
  <text start="408.979" dur="7.231">buying that home this is what we are</text>
  <text start="412.64" dur="6.33">seeing and what this means is that the</text>
  <text start="416.21" dur="3.99">housing market which has been pumped up</text>
  <text start="418.97" dur="2.91">in 20 different cities to make us</text>
  <text start="420.2" dur="6.51">believe that the housing market is doing</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="7.65">well is starting to come down and we can</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="5.19">see right now that inflation has been</text>
  <text start="429.53" dur="4.79">pushed into the housing market it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="5.519">pushed into the stock market into the</text>

  <text start="437.419" dur="3.901">insurance and it&amp;#39;s been exported out to</text>
  <text start="440.3" dur="3.42">other countries</text>
  <text start="441.32" dur="5.46">well this inflation is starting to show</text>
  <text start="443.72" dur="5.64">up here back in the states and if gas</text>
  <text start="446.78" dur="5.04">prices move up were in really big</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="4.56">trouble and as we move forward right now</text>
  <text start="451.82" dur="4.77">we can see that things are star</text>
  <text start="453.92" dur="8.61">to really fall apart and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="456.59" dur="7.41">to see inflation now when I say this we</text>
  <text start="462.53" dur="4.56">need to look at what is happening right</text>
  <text start="464" dur="5.52">now and the single best means of</text>
  <text start="467.09" dur="4.95">measuring inflation vers deflationary</text>
  <text start="469.52" dur="7.53">forces in the US financial system is the</text>

  <text start="477.05" dur="5.34">rallies the system is predicting</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="5.91">inflation when it falls the system is</text>
  <text start="482.39" dur="5.85">fearing deflation running back to 2010</text>
  <text start="485.66" dur="6.26">we&amp;#39;ve been in a long-term deflationary</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="7.65">downtrend on this ratio but we have seen</text>
  <text start="491.92" dur="6.34">inflation you know pop up in food prices</text>
  <text start="495.89" dur="3.48">and other things but a lot of it the</text>
  <text start="498.26" dur="3.39">central bank&amp;#39;s have been trying to</text>
  <text start="499.37" dur="6.06">export away from the people so you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="501.65" dur="5.91">really see it this deflationary pull has</text>
  <text start="505.43" dur="4.86">dragged down the entire commodity</text>
  <text start="507.56" dur="5.22">complex over the same time period but</text>
  <text start="510.29" dur="5.22">this is about to end now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.78" dur="5.67">seeing is the TLT ratio has massive</text>
  <text start="515.51" dur="5.16">support and current levels and given the</text>
  <text start="518.45" dur="5.73">clear descending wedge pattern its form</text>
  <text start="520.67" dur="7.16">right now the odds are favouring a sharp</text>
  <text start="524.18" dur="7.02">breakout to the upside sometime in 2018</text>
  <text start="527.83" dur="6.61">which means that inflation is going to</text>
  <text start="531.2" dur="5.79">spike and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this in</text>
  <text start="534.44" dur="5.1">food prices we&amp;#39;re starting to see it in</text>
  <text start="536.99" dur="4.47">many different areas and as the Middle</text>
  <text start="539.54" dur="3.96">East breaks down and people aren&amp;#39;t using</text>
  <text start="541.46" dur="3.93">the dollar to pay for the natural</text>

  <text start="560.42" dur="6">can&amp;#39;t happen but we do see it happening</text>
  <text start="563.39" dur="4.86">now think about what is happening the</text>
  <text start="566.42" dur="3.66">Middle East right now is pivoting</text>
  <text start="568.25" dur="3.81">towards Russia they&amp;#39;re looking and this</text>
