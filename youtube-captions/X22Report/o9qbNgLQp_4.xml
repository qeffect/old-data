  <text start="96.799" dur="8.85">to push fear and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="101.45" dur="6.779">we&amp;#39;re seeing out in the UK the central</text>
  <text start="105.649" dur="6.481">bank is now projecting that if the</text>
  <text start="108.229" dur="7.95">brexit happens the country would go into</text>

  <text start="116.179" dur="7.171">skyrocket people would lose jobs left</text>
  <text start="118.88" dur="6.839">and right the fear mongering will</text>
  <text start="123.35" dur="6.48">intensify as we get closer to October</text>
  <text start="125.719" dur="6.451">31st so what the central bank did they</text>
  <text start="129.83" dur="3.989">indicated that Ireland could be facing</text>

  <text start="133.819" dur="5.671">EU without a deal if a no brexit deal is</text>
  <text start="137.209" dur="6">realized the effect will be felt in the</text>
  <text start="139.49" dur="7.2">early part of 2020 in all areas of the</text>
  <text start="143.209" dur="5.311">economy and they put out a forecast of</text>
  <text start="146.69" dur="4.53">course I made a couple of charts with</text>
  <text start="148.52" dur="5.43">dashed lines and they said this is what</text>
  <text start="151.22" dur="5.16">happens if we have a brexit deal this is</text>
  <text start="153.95" dur="5.18">what happens if we don&amp;#39;t have a brexit</text>
  <text start="156.38" dur="6.06">deal and if you stay with the EU</text>
  <text start="159.13" dur="6.87">everything would be just absolutely fine</text>
  <text start="162.44" dur="6.68">and what they&amp;#39;re saying here is that</text>
  <text start="166" dur="5.95">through their forecasts you would see</text>
  <text start="169.12" dur="4.27">unemployment it would rise from five</text>
  <text start="171.95" dur="5.57">point three percent to six point nine</text>
  <text start="173.39" dur="7.2">percent in 2021 GDP growth would decline</text>
  <text start="177.52" dur="5.35">now think about what the deep state but</text>
  <text start="180.59" dur="4.2">the central bank is saying here if you</text>
  <text start="182.87" dur="3.53">don&amp;#39;t follow our plan and you don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="184.79" dur="4.05">a deal in the best interest of the EU</text>
  <text start="186.4" dur="4.66">your entire country is going to go into</text>
  <text start="188.84" dur="4.44">a recession but if you stay with the</text>
  <text start="191.06" dur="3.75">central bank and you make a incredible</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="5.52">deal which does not benefit the people</text>
  <text start="194.81" dur="7.26">your country will be fine and what I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="198.8" dur="6.18">like to do is I like to bring us back to</text>
  <text start="202.07" dur="6.44">when the central bankers took us off the</text>
  <text start="204.98" dur="7.02">gold standard this is back in 1970-71</text>
  <text start="208.51" dur="5.17">now back then did they tell us that hey</text>
  <text start="212" dur="3.42">listen when we take you off the gold</text>
  <text start="213.68" dur="4.04">standard you&amp;#39;re gonna be going into a</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="5.01">recession they&amp;#39;ll be long gas lines</text>

  <text start="220.43" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;ll be tough for many many people no</text>
  <text start="223.25" dur="4.17">they didn&amp;#39;t say this they said</text>
  <text start="224.96" dur="3.96">everything is going to be spent actually</text>
  <text start="227.42" dur="4.68">they didn&amp;#39;t say anything you know why</text>
  <text start="228.92" dur="5.13">because they didn&amp;#39;t tell anyone they</text>
  <text start="232.1" dur="5.07">said oh look there&amp;#39;s an oil crisis</text>
  <text start="234.05" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s why we have a problem who created</text>
  <text start="237.17" dur="5.64">the oil crisis oh that&amp;#39;s right the</text>
  <text start="239.48" dur="11.01">central bank the deep state go back to</text>
  <text start="242.81" dur="10.97">the 70s from 73 to 75 in the UK they had</text>
  <text start="250.49" dur="7.26">an oil crisis there were stagflation</text>
  <text start="253.78" dur="7.78">people had no jobs the average inflation</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="9.6">was 9.2 percent in 73 16 percent in 74</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="7.47">24 percent in 75 think about this this</text>
  <text start="267.35" dur="5.64">is what happened when the central</text>
  <text start="269.03" dur="6.57">bankers put us on their system now yes</text>
  <text start="272.99" dur="4.98">in the beginning they make it seem like</text>
  <text start="275.6" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s incredible this is going to benefit</text>
  <text start="277.97" dur="4.98">everybody and those people in the</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="5.19">beginning they feel like it does but as</text>
  <text start="282.95" dur="6.15">soon as we went on their system the</text>
  <text start="285.47" dur="5.49">currency lost value that&amp;#39;s why you saw</text>
  <text start="289.1" dur="4.319">inflation that&amp;#39;s why you saw your homes</text>
  <text start="290.96" dur="4.29">go up that&amp;#39;s why you saw your salaries</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="2.641">go up it wasn&amp;#39;t because you were making</text>
  <text start="295.25" dur="6.29">more</text>
  <text start="296.06" dur="9.57">it had a readjustment a canal</text>
  <text start="301.54" dur="6.7">to buy a cup of coffee do you feel like</text>
  <text start="305.63" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s a good situation well isn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="308.24" dur="5.55">the same situation when we came off the</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="7.17">gold standard you needed more cash to</text>
  <text start="313.79" dur="7.25">purchase the same exact thing to do the</text>
  <text start="316.85" dur="7.35">same work you received more dollars but</text>
  <text start="321.04" dur="6.22">did that benefit you not really because</text>
  <text start="324.2" dur="5.13">everything else went up you see what</text>
  <text start="327.26" dur="6.9">happened here and think about the United</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="7.08">States this was 1969 to 1975 the United</text>
  <text start="334.16" dur="3.33">States was in a recession of course they</text>
  <text start="336.41" dur="4.8">said the same thing we have an oil</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="7.86">crisis we had lines at the gas station</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="5.46">red green flags odd-even plates that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.35" dur="4.77">when you can fill up remember they were</text>
  <text start="346.67" dur="8.28">transferring us from a gold standard</text>
  <text start="350.12" dur="7.38">system onto a complete fiat system that</text>
  <text start="354.95" dur="4.47">was backed by the petro dollar where the</text>
  <text start="357.5" dur="4.41">deal was made out in the Middle East and</text>
  <text start="359.42" dur="4.79">it took time to adjust and when you came</text>
  <text start="361.91" dur="5.79">off something that was solid sound money</text>
  <text start="364.21" dur="6.4">well you saw this now we&amp;#39;re going the</text>
  <text start="367.7" dur="5.42">other way think about it we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="6.12">from this broken-down</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="8.56">unreliable fiat system are we seeing the</text>
  <text start="376.73" dur="7.2">16% inflation now are we seeing 8%</text>
  <text start="381.68" dur="3.87">interest rates 10% interest rates</text>
  <text start="383.93" dur="3.6">because they needed to do that to combat</text>
  <text start="385.55" dur="6">the inflation are we seeing that our</text>
  <text start="387.53" dur="6.09">wages increasing or doubling like we saw</text>
  <text start="391.55" dur="3.96">a bat or tripling that we saw back in</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="4.5">the seventh no actually everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.51" dur="4.83">going the opposite way so when we make</text>
  <text start="398.12" dur="5.07">this transition this time it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="4.86">be a little bit tougher and this is why</text>
  <text start="403.19" dur="6.62">trumpet the Patriots this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="405.2" dur="8.52">been pushing to create an economy that</text>
  <text start="409.81" dur="6.88">will be able to withstand the entire</text>
  <text start="413.72" dur="4.77">transition move they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="416.69" dur="3.48">it as painless as possible now can they</text>
  <text start="418.49" dur="4.14">make it completely painless now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.17" dur="5.22">completely impossible a lot of people</text>
  <text start="422.63" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s going to take them by surprise but</text>
  <text start="425.39" dur="4.15">they&amp;#39;re going to do the best they</text>
  <text start="426.41" dur="5.73">possibly can and the only way to do this</text>

  <text start="563.13" dur="4.77">over the Chinese and Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="565.5" dur="5.1">the following good things are happening</text>
  <text start="567.9" dur="5.55">at China trade talk meeting warmer</text>
  <text start="570.6" dur="4.89">feelings than in recent past more like</text>

  <text start="575.49" dur="3.81">vice premier today all would like to see</text>
  <text start="577.77" dur="3.33">something significant happen</text>
  <text start="579.3" dur="3.36">he continued one of the great things</text>
  <text start="581.1" dur="4.17">about China deal is that the fact that</text>
  <text start="582.66" dur="4.74">the various reasons we do not have to go</text>
  <text start="585.27" dur="4.02">through the very long and politically</text>
  <text start="587.4" dur="4.89">complex congressional approval process</text>

  <text start="592.92" dur="5.67">on behalf of our country fast and clean</text>
  <text start="596.97" dur="4.11">and he&amp;#39;s absolutely right</text>

  <text start="607.38" dur="6.2">he can make a deal we&amp;#39;re trying to no</text>
  <text start="608.76" dur="7.89">the question is why is China warmer</text>
