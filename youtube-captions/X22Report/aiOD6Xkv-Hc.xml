  <text start="32.129" dur="7.261">episode 596 and today&amp;#39;s date is februari</text>
  <text start="35.82" dur="6.15">19 2015 and the title this episode is</text>
  <text start="39.39" dur="5.809">obama says that the economy is poised</text>
  <text start="41.97" dur="5.97">for a great year as the economy</text>
  <text start="45.199" dur="5.081">collapses let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="3.99">economic collapse news now we understand</text>
  <text start="50.28" dur="3.209">the battle between Greece and your group</text>
  <text start="51.93" dur="3.75">is still continuing but right now the</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="5.25">Greek government they submitted a letter</text>
  <text start="55.68" dur="5.97">to the Eurogroup asking for a six-month</text>
  <text start="58.739" dur="5.401">extension of the loan agreement now the</text>
  <text start="61.65" dur="5.34">urek group has two options either accept</text>
  <text start="64.14" dur="5.13">or reject the Greek requests now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="6.03">come out and they said we looked at this</text>
  <text start="69.27" dur="5.73">and we&amp;#39;re going to reject it Germany</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="4.98">actually slams the Greek bailout</text>
  <text start="75" dur="5.82">extension proposal the Greek letter is</text>
  <text start="78" dur="5.009">not clear at all Germany says but opens</text>
  <text start="80.82" dur="4.439">a men&amp;#39;s room for interpretation to</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="5.64">mention the three most important points</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="5.011">it includes no clear commitment to</text>
  <text start="88.649" dur="3.991">successfully conclude the current</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="5.43">program and it falls short of a clear</text>
  <text start="92.64" dur="4.859">freeze of Greek measures this is why the</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="4.799">letter is not in line with the last year</text>
  <text start="97.499" dur="5.79">group position it rather represents a</text>
  <text start="100.499" dur="6.72">Trojan horse intending to bridge</text>
  <text start="103.289" dur="5.64">financing and never really go along with</text>
  <text start="107.219" dur="4.29">what we want and that is to pay the full</text>
  <text start="108.929" dur="6.061">amount of the debt and we can see they</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="7.28">cannot come together on this and as the</text>
  <text start="114.99" dur="7.379">Eurogroup continually pushes and Greece</text>
  <text start="118.789" dur="6.28">continually tries to give proposals and</text>
  <text start="122.369" dur="4.081">extend what has been going on we can see</text>
  <text start="125.069" dur="3.601">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="4.04">that Greece most likely will turn to</text>
  <text start="128.67" dur="5.22">Russia because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="130.49" dur="5.59">things are not working out not at all I</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="5.19">mean the Eurogroup is continually giving</text>
  <text start="136.08" dur="4.68">ultimatums Greece is handing over</text>
  <text start="139.08" dur="2.969">proposals they&amp;#39;re not going to pay</text>
  <text start="140.76" dur="4.259">that they&amp;#39;re not going to impose</text>
  <text start="142.049" dur="7.651">austerity they&amp;#39;re getting extensions</text>
  <text start="145.019" dur="6.36">from the emergency loan program and this</text>
  <text start="149.7" dur="3.75">is really actually going nowhere at this</text>
  <text start="151.379" dur="4.17">point and they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="153.45" dur="5.52">finally make a decision as the clock</text>
  <text start="155.549" dur="5.101">ticks down either you know what the debt</text>
  <text start="158.97" dur="3.78">is cancelled we&amp;#39;re writing it off</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="3.839">completely and we&amp;#39;re no longer going</text>
  <text start="162.75" dur="3.209">with the Eurogroup now they might be</text>
  <text start="164.489" dur="3.09">doing this in secret where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="165.959" dur="4.441">preparing everything to go with Russia</text>
  <text start="167.579" dur="6.121">and they just need the time to do this</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="4.5">and this is what it&amp;#39;s looking like to me</text>
  <text start="173.7" dur="3.42">at this point but we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="4.77">continually watch this and follow what</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="6.989">is going on now here in the United</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="7.98">States we see that the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="184.109" dur="5.49">claims they&amp;#39;ve beat expectations and</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="3.869">again we have to remember how this is</text>
  <text start="189.599" dur="3.901">all calculated all the retail stores and</text>
  <text start="191.519" dur="5.19">all those people that are being laid off</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="6.03">all those people that can&amp;#39;t find jobs</text>
  <text start="196.709" dur="5.37">who are continually continually looking</text>
  <text start="199.53" dur="5.7">but having been on an interview for four</text>
  <text start="202.079" dur="5.63">weeks or so they&amp;#39;re just not counted but</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="5.25">we see that for the ninth week in a row</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="6.131">the smooth average of initial jobless</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="8.129">claims in Texas surged continuing claims</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="6.6">jump 58,000 22.4 25 million the biggest</text>
  <text start="218.609" dur="5.401">jump in 2015 notably missing</text>
  <text start="220.44" dur="6.87">expectations the trend of employment has</text>
  <text start="224.01" dur="6.119">clearly changed at this point and we see</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="4.17">as time goes on things will be getting</text>
  <text start="230.129" dur="2.491">worse and of course they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="231.48" dur="3.3">have to admit they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="232.62" dur="3.479">manipulate these numbers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="3.69">going to have to show that yeah yeah all</text>
  <text start="236.099" dur="3.72">these people they&amp;#39;re not looking we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.47" dur="3.15">not going to be counting these people</text>
  <text start="239.819" dur="4.56">and this is what they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="4.949">doing to keep the unemployment where it</text>
  <text start="244.379" dur="4.561">is and we know this is completely fake</text>
  <text start="246.569" dur="3.901">phony and false even the CEO of Gallup</text>
  <text start="248.94" dur="3.54">came out and said yeah it&amp;#39;s a big lie</text>
  <text start="250.47" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s no way that the unemployment is</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="4.65">five point six five point seven percent</text>
  <text start="254.31" dur="5.399">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible and we know</text>
  <text start="257.13" dur="4.859">this because when we look at what is</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="4.321">going on and the amount of people and</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="4.05">the amount of people that are going that</text>
  <text start="264.03" dur="3.99">are being laid off and the amount of</text>
  <text start="266.039" dur="3.781">stores that are closing the amount of</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="3.51">people who are being laid off in the</text>
  <text start="269.82" dur="3.36">stores the amount to people who are</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="3.06">being laid off because of the oil</text>
  <text start="273.18" dur="4.17">suppression</text>
  <text start="274.59" dur="5.1">there is no way that unemployment is</text>
  <text start="277.35" dur="4.68">where it is today it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="279.69" dur="3.96">impossible but again we have to remember</text>
  <text start="282.03" dur="3.18">how they counted those people have one</text>
  <text start="283.65" dur="4.98">part time job or two part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="285.21" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re counted as a full-time job if</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re working in a part-time job and</text>
  <text start="290.28" dur="4.44">they don&amp;#39;t work a certain number of</text>
  <text start="292.98" dur="5.61">hours or receive a certain number of</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="6.21">dollars and they get laid off they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="298.59" dur="4.38">plot for unemployment insurance so you</text>
  <text start="300.93" dur="3.66">can see how this works to the benefit of</text>
  <text start="302.97" dur="5.28">the government with their manipulated</text>
  <text start="304.59" dur="6.12">numbers now we see the philly fed it has</text>
  <text start="308.25" dur="4.35">been falling for the third month in a</text>
  <text start="310.71" dur="6.18">row philly fed printed worse than</text>
  <text start="312.6" dur="8.28">expected at 5.2 against expectations of</text>
  <text start="316.89" dur="6.75">an 8.4 it&amp;#39;s the lowest in a year new</text>
  <text start="320.88" dur="5.61">orders tumbled to its lowest and a year</text>
  <text start="323.64" dur="6.51">but most critically hope the six-month</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="10.02">forward outlook index tumbled from 50.9</text>
  <text start="330.15" dur="7.38">to 29.7 we can see it is definitely not</text>
  <text start="336.51" dur="3.09">getting better and when we look at</text>
  <text start="337.53" dur="5.01">caterpillar what are we seeing well</text>
  <text start="339.6" dur="5.85">Calla put caterpillar just reported that</text>
  <text start="342.54" dur="5.91">in January it suffered its worst retail</text>
  <text start="345.45" dur="5.52">sales since Lehman with global sales</text>
  <text start="348.45" dur="4.86">plunging fourteen percent from last</text>
  <text start="350.97" dur="4.92">January when sales in turn had dropped</text>
  <text start="353.31" dur="4.71">eight percent from a year before while</text>
  <text start="355.89" dur="4.14">the year before had slid three percent</text>
  <text start="358.02" dur="4.41">from the from the year before that and</text>
  <text start="360.03" dur="5.28">so on and when we look at caterpillar</text>
  <text start="362.43" dur="5.58">what are we seeing well we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="365.31" dur="6.89">during the Great Recession going from</text>

  <text start="388.79" dur="7.24">the entire company is disintegrating the</text>
  <text start="393.78" dur="4.89">economy not just in the United States</text>
  <text start="396.03" dur="5.43">but around the world it is not getting</text>

  <text start="438.84" dur="7.53">too many yards and too few orders that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.469" dur="5.611">exactly it people are not out there</text>

  <text start="454.349" dur="4.32">this what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now the</text>
  <text start="456.18" dur="7.829">Baltic Dry Index popped up two points to</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="8.761">about 5 11 but the glut from the Baltic</text>
  <text start="464.009" dur="6.21">Dry Index has pushed new vessel prices</text>
  <text start="467.43" dur="5.91">to eight year lows and caused a</text>
  <text start="470.219" dur="5.45">49-percent plunge in first-half orders</text>
  <text start="473.34" dur="5.1">at the nation&amp;#39;s more than 1500</text>

  <text start="508.4" dur="5.29">this moment when our economy is growing</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="6.3">and creating jobs Obama wrote that now</text>
