  <text start="120.869" dur="3.901">worse every single day and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="122.88" dur="4.32">saying this in the reports that the</text>

  <text start="127.2" dur="4.56">countries i mean it&amp;#39;s ranging anywhere</text>

  <text start="131.76" dur="3.839">on which country and you have to</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="4.049">remember the youth this is the</text>
  <text start="135.599" dur="4.441">foundation of every single country</text>
  <text start="137.849" dur="2.97">because they come at a college or they</text>
  <text start="140.04" dur="2.85">come out of</text>

  <text start="157.65" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re seeing just not in Europe but in</text>
  <text start="159.569" dur="5.04">the US we&amp;#39;re seeing that youth</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="4.86">unemployment is getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="164.609" dur="4.981">and right now the International Monetary</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="5.399">Fund has warned about the high level of</text>
  <text start="169.59" dur="4.709">youth unemployment in Italy but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.379" dur="4.89">not worried about it in Greece which is</text>
  <text start="174.299" dur="5.22">much much higher and right now with</text>
  <text start="177.269" dur="4.761">youth joblessness over forty two percent</text>
  <text start="179.519" dur="5.461">the highest level ever recorded since</text>
  <text start="182.03" dur="5.079">1977 they&amp;#39;re saying that this is going</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="4.8">to have a major problem in this country</text>
  <text start="187.109" dur="4.77">and I hate to say it it&amp;#39;s going to have</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="4.349">this problem is going to be in every</text>
  <text start="191.879" dur="3.84">single one of the countries even the</text>
  <text start="194.129" dur="4.98">United States because without the youth</text>
  <text start="195.719" dur="5.58">working we have major problems and what</text>
  <text start="199.109" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re worried about is that since the</text>
  <text start="201.299" dur="4.171">youth cannot find employment in Italy</text>
  <text start="203.519" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re going to leave the country and</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="3.87">go someplace else and what this goes on</text>
  <text start="207.959" dur="3">to say that the soaring youth</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="3.539">unemployment in Italy leaves an</text>
  <text start="210.959" dur="4.71">increasing number of young people with</text>
  <text start="212.879" dur="5.551">no option but to migrate to countries</text>
  <text start="215.669" dur="4.261">with better economies and more jobs and</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s getting harder to find those</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="4.919">countries and as more more more more of</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="4.259">those people pour in to other countries</text>
  <text start="224.849" dur="4.17">that do have good economies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.009" dur="3.93">going to have going to run into a point</text>
  <text start="229.019" dur="3.96">where these people still can&amp;#39;t get jobs</text>
  <text start="230.939" dur="5.401">because there&amp;#39;s just too many of them</text>
  <text start="232.979" dur="5.97">and this is a no-win situation and we</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="5.31">see this problem continually happening</text>
  <text start="238.949" dur="4.801">in every single country it is not</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="3.69">getting better it is getting worse so</text>
  <text start="243.75" dur="3.15">when they&amp;#39;re out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="4.369">they&amp;#39;re saying this incredible recovery</text>
  <text start="246.9" dur="6.269">GDP is going to grow how there&amp;#39;s nobody</text>
  <text start="249.709" dur="5.821">working there&amp;#39;s no one producing it</text>
  <text start="253.169" dur="5.22">makes no sense in what they are saying</text>
  <text start="255.53" dur="4.989">now here in the United States I talk</text>
  <text start="258.389" dur="4.65">about real estate quite a bit and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.519" dur="4.981">following the pattern of mortgage</text>
  <text start="263.039" dur="4.831">applications declining we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="265.5" dur="4.05">the insiders are dumping their real</text>
  <text start="267.87" dur="4.5">estate they bought it in cash they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="4.03">trying to get everyday American people</text>
  <text start="272.37" dur="3.069">to buy it and there</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="3.989">having a very tough time finding those</text>
  <text start="275.439" dur="5.341">people but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now a</text>
  <text start="277.569" dur="6.72">greater share of the u.s. mortgages were</text>
  <text start="280.78" dur="7.229">30 to 59 days past due in the fourth</text>
  <text start="284.289" dur="6.69">quarter of 2013 and rising in the first</text>
  <text start="288.009" dur="5.94">quarter of 2014 so what does this</text>
  <text start="290.979" dur="5.131">actually tell us it tells us those</text>
  <text start="293.949" dur="3.9">people who are being laid off those</text>
  <text start="296.11" dur="4.5">people who are trying to get by are</text>
  <text start="297.849" dur="6.06">having a tough time right now paying</text>
  <text start="300.61" dur="5.22">their mortgages and this is just getting</text>
  <text start="303.909" dur="5.25">worse and worse because the unemployment</text>
  <text start="305.83" dur="6.329">is not really going down it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="309.159" dur="5.401">going up more people are unemployed more</text>
  <text start="312.159" dur="5.19">people are underemployed and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="4.71">getting worse with these people trying</text>
  <text start="317.349" dur="4.891">to pay their mortgages trying to pay</text>
  <text start="319.27" dur="6.03">their rent trying to buy food trying to</text>
  <text start="322.24" dur="4.979">clothe their children and this situation</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="5.13">is showing us that the real estate</text>
  <text start="327.219" dur="7.111">market is not going to get better the</text>
  <text start="330.43" dur="6.509">economy is in a downward spiral and we</text>
  <text start="334.33" dur="5.88">realize and the government realizes that</text>
  <text start="336.939" dur="5.76">there is a collapse on the horizon and</text>
  <text start="340.21" dur="5.4">we can see it coming we know it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="342.699" dur="5.43">and every time we go through this data</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="7.049">we see more and more evidence that it is</text>
  <text start="348.129" dur="7.231">coming faster and faster towards us now</text>
  <text start="352.659" dur="6.421">out on the cliven Bundy ranch we see</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="6.39">that this had nothing to do with turtles</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="4.589">tortoises it had nothing to do with fees</text>
  <text start="361.75" dur="3.9">it had nothing to do with anything that</text>
  <text start="363.669" dur="3.601">they were talking about because what</text>
  <text start="365.65" dur="2.639">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and thank you for</text>
  <text start="367.27" dur="4.709">those people who sent me this</text>
  <text start="368.289" dur="6.541">information that Harry Reid is a part of</text>
  <text start="371.979" dur="6">this so is his son Rory Reid they are a</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="4.799">part of this whole problem in my last</text>
  <text start="377.979" dur="3.84">report I said I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="379.629" dur="4.32">it led up to a governor official well</text>
  <text start="381.819" dur="5.07">here we are with the government official</text>
  <text start="383.949" dur="4.83">this goes on to say that Harry Reid had</text>
  <text start="386.889" dur="5.75">plans for a solar plant that would go</text>
  <text start="388.779" dur="7.32">right we&amp;#39;re Bundy&amp;#39;s cattle grazing has</text>
  <text start="392.639" dur="6.551">has been done here one document produced</text>
  <text start="396.099" dur="5.19">by the BML BLM indicates that this area</text>
  <text start="399.19" dur="4.83">where Bundy grazes his cattle has been</text>
  <text start="401.289" dur="4.951">designated a solar energy zone the</text>
  <text start="404.02" dur="3.269">document states in part nongovernmental</text>
  <text start="406.24" dur="2.97">organizations</text>
  <text start="407.289" dur="5.011">expressed concern that the regional</text>
  <text start="409.21" dur="5.909">mitigation strategy for the dry lake and</text>
  <text start="412.3" dur="5.789">solar energy zone utilizes gold Butte as</text>
  <text start="415.119" dur="4.95">a location for off-site mitigation for</text>
  <text start="418.089" dur="4.771">impact from the solar development and</text>
  <text start="420.069" dur="4.8">that those restoration activities are</text>
  <text start="422.86" dur="5.729">not durable with the presence of</text>
  <text start="424.869" dur="6.42">trespass cattle Reed and his oldest son</text>
  <text start="428.589" dur="6.45">Rory are both involved an effort by a</text>
  <text start="431.289" dur="6.66">Chinese energy giant enn energy group to</text>
  <text start="435.039" dur="5.21">build a 5 billion solo solar farm and</text>
  <text start="437.949" dur="6.18">panel manufacturing plant in the</text>
  <text start="440.249" dur="5.35">Southern Nevada desert Reed has been one</text>
  <text start="444.129" dur="3.75">of the project&amp;#39;s most prominent</text>
  <text start="445.599" dur="5.52">advocates helping recruit the company</text>
  <text start="447.879" dur="5.4">during a 2011 trip to China and applying</text>
  <text start="451.119" dur="4.561">his political muscle on behalf of the</text>
  <text start="453.279" dur="5.01">project in Nevada so we can see right</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="6.12">now that all of this again is a complete</text>
  <text start="458.289" dur="5.94">lie why the BLM was there why they</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="5.13">wanted cheese why they took his cattle</text>
  <text start="464.229" dur="5.101">all of it was an illusion it was fake</text>
  <text start="466.93" dur="3.87">just like everything else the government</text>
  <text start="469.33" dur="4.949">tells us it always comes back to</text>
  <text start="470.8" dur="7.019">corporate money control the people and</text>
  <text start="474.279" dur="8.49">we see this continually happening over</text>
  <text start="477.819" dur="7.83">and over again now there is a newspaper</text>
  <text start="482.769" dur="6.18">out there or a website out there that</text>
  <text start="485.649" dur="5.7">the daily cause and they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="488.949" dur="4.53">saying that and their labeling cliven</text>
  <text start="491.349" dur="4.29">Bundy right now as the right-wing</text>
  <text start="493.479" dur="4.71">extremists and their enablers are</text>
  <text start="495.639" dur="4.471">defending a far-right domestic terrorist</text>
  <text start="498.189" dur="4.29">lawbreaker by the name of cliven Bundy</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="4.139">who is threatening a range war against</text>
  <text start="502.479" dur="3.9">the federal government and we have to</text>
  <text start="504.249" dur="5.19">remember when they start labeling people</text>
  <text start="506.379" dur="5.22">domestic terrorists extremists things</text>
  <text start="509.439" dur="5.85">like that we have to think of the NDAA</text>
  <text start="511.599" dur="6">and this is how they will use this</text>
  <text start="515.289" dur="4.081">against the people the people that</text>
  <text start="517.599" dur="4.05">aren&amp;#39;t doing what the federal government</text>
  <text start="519.37" dur="4.319">wants they can start labeling them</text>
  <text start="521.649" dur="4.771">domestic terrorists once your or an</text>
  <text start="523.689" dur="5.13">extremist or a radical right-wing</text>
  <text start="526.42" dur="4.71">extremist or whatever they like to call</text>
  <text start="528.819" dur="4.471">you because then this fits into the NDAA</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="4.92">then they can say well according to the</text>
  <text start="533.29" dur="5.37">end a NDAA law you are domestic</text>
  <text start="536.05" dur="4.74">terrorist we need to lock you up for one</text>
  <text start="538.66" dur="4.98">year without due process and we</text>
  <text start="540.79" dur="5.22">can see how this could apply to every</text>
  <text start="543.64" dur="4.29">single person that criticizes or does</text>
  <text start="546.01" dur="3.51">not go along with the government because</text>
  <text start="547.93" dur="5.34">most of the time the federal government</text>
  <text start="549.52" dur="7.05">is pushing individual agendas in the</text>
  <text start="553.27" dur="5.04">Senate in the White House and any part</text>
  <text start="556.57" dur="5.25">of the government because it goes back</text>
  <text start="558.31" dur="5.55">to corporations money control the people</text>
  <text start="561.82" dur="3.78">so every time you see the government</text>
  <text start="563.86" dur="3.54">come down hard on the people just like</text>
  <text start="565.6" dur="5.43">this with snipers and helicopters and</text>
  <text start="567.4" dur="6.24">armed men and dogs this is not how a</text>
  <text start="571.03" dur="5.49">government conducts itself when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="6.27">dealing with a person that is trampling</text>
  <text start="576.52" dur="6.03">on the rights of a turtle or owes fees</text>
  <text start="579.91" dur="5.49">it is another reason that goes far</text>
  <text start="582.55" dur="5.61">beyond what the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="585.4" dur="5.25">telling everyone and I see in ABC news</text>
  <text start="588.16" dur="5.31">and other news organizations they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="590.65" dur="5.73">even lead into Harry Reid or anything</text>
  <text start="593.47" dur="5.04">like this or fracking or anything else</text>
  <text start="596.38" dur="4.59">that has to do with this they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="598.51" dur="7.17">mention it whatsoever but there has been</text>
  <text start="600.97" dur="6.48">an update with BLM and clive in bundy it</text>
  <text start="605.68" dur="3.3">seems like they&amp;#39;ve made some type of</text>
  <text start="607.45" dur="3.69">deal right here the Bureau of Land</text>
  <text start="608.98" dur="5">Management is backing away from the</text>
  <text start="611.14" dur="6.51">Bundy ranch citing safety issues and</text>
  <text start="613.98" dur="5.2">again safety issues for who first of all</text>
  <text start="617.65" dur="3.78">the people are out there in their own</text>
  <text start="619.18" dur="3.96">free will fighting against something</text>
  <text start="621.43" dur="3.9">that the federal government is trying to</text>
  <text start="623.14" dur="4.68">push on them and what the government is</text>
  <text start="625.33" dur="5.67">trying to push on them is fake false and</text>
  <text start="627.82" dur="5.64">phony and completely illegal and what</text>
  <text start="631" dur="4.02">they are doing and this goes on to say</text>

  <text start="966.18" dur="4.23">we can see that something is definitely</text>
  <text start="967.98" dur="3.66">up and something is about to happen and</text>
  <text start="970.41" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s an additional</text>

  <text start="979.02" dur="4.62">planning something they are definitely</text>
  <text start="981.06" dur="4.29">getting ready to do something and we all</text>
  <text start="983.64" dur="5.13">need to be ready because there could be</text>
  <text start="985.35" dur="6.6">a false flag on the way at this time to</text>
  <text start="988.77" dur="8.43">push the agenda forward and to get this</text>
  <text start="991.95" dur="8.13">war started now Canada is considering an</text>
  <text start="997.2" dur="5.7">internet bill that&amp;#39;s like sistah but on</text>
  <text start="1000.08" dur="4.53">steroids earlier this week politicians</text>
  <text start="1002.9" dur="4.17">in Canada introduced the digital privacy</text>
  <text start="1004.61" dur="4.32">act a bill that looks a lot like the</text>
  <text start="1007.07" dur="3.42">United States Cyber information sharing</text>
  <text start="1008.93" dur="3.81">a Protection Act but it goes a little</text>
  <text start="1010.49" dur="4.41">bit further because the SIS / bill says</text>
  <text start="1012.74" dur="4.05">they the companies could share</text>
  <text start="1014.9" dur="4.62">information if there is a cyber threat</text>
  <text start="1016.79" dur="5.37">the Canadian bill the digiti the digital</text>
  <text start="1019.52" dur="5.22">Privacy Act bill allows everyone to</text>
  <text start="1022.16" dur="4.92">share information even though there</text>
  <text start="1024.74" dur="4.23">isn&amp;#39;t a cyber threat and that they can</text>
  <text start="1027.08" dur="5.25">share it with anyone with with legal</text>
  <text start="1028.97" dur="5.82">immunity so it seems like every country</text>
  <text start="1032.33" dur="5.34">is going down the same path they want</text>
  <text start="1034.79" dur="4.8">the information from these companies</text>
  <text start="1037.67" dur="3.9">shared with the government so they can</text>
  <text start="1039.59" dur="4.29">continually spy on the people make their</text>
  <text start="1041.57" dur="5.25">lists understand what assets they have</text>
  <text start="1043.88" dur="5.4">who they&amp;#39;re in contact with this is what</text>
  <text start="1046.82" dur="5.82">this is all about it&amp;#39;s about control</text>
  <text start="1049.28" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s pretty much it now DHS is out</text>
  <text start="1052.64" dur="4.14">there with an additional alert about the</text>

  <text start="1064.58" dur="4.74">industrial control systems and they are</text>
  <text start="1067.13" dur="4.65">being investigated right now and this</text>
  <text start="1069.32" dur="5.92">goes to critical infrastructures like</text>
  <text start="1071.78" dur="7.149">power grid systems chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1075.24" dur="7.77">I mean chemical plants and other type of</text>

  <text start="1083.01" dur="6.63">all these things the heartbleed might</text>
  <text start="1085.65" dur="6.779">have been used for where I&amp;#39;ll say cyber</text>
  <text start="1089.64" dur="6.03">actors might have got into the system</text>
  <text start="1092.429" dur="5.281">and planted something there to be used</text>
  <text start="1095.67" dur="4.2">later on so we can see how all this</text>
  <text start="1097.71" dur="4.8">propaganda is starting to now move</text>

  <text start="1104.85" dur="6.36">we could see a blackout we could see</text>
  <text start="1107.4" dur="7.26">this bug really affect all the systems</text>
  <text start="1111.21" dur="4.89">and again we have to understand that the</text>
