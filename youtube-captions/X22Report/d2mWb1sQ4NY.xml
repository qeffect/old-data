  <text start="155.069" dur="8.461">happen for a little bit of time</text>
  <text start="159.39" dur="8.379">the Patriots need to educate the people</text>
  <text start="163.53" dur="7.03">the people need to understand what the</text>
  <text start="167.769" dur="4.92">central bank is all about if you go up</text>
  <text start="170.56" dur="3.959">to a person on the street most of the</text>

  <text start="182.739" dur="7.47">about they have no clue and this is why</text>
  <text start="186.939" dur="6.781">all of this has to be done in a way just</text>
  <text start="190.209" dur="5.61">like exposing the deep state showing who</text>
  <text start="193.72" dur="3.299">all these characters are it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="195.819" dur="3.78">exact process</text>

  <text start="202.18" dur="4.649">people are dumb or stupid or whatever</text>
  <text start="204.909" dur="4.711">you want to call it what I&amp;#39;m saying is</text>
  <text start="206.829" dur="5.13">that they&amp;#39;re not informed they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="209.62" dur="5.339">paying attention to the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="211.959" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;ve been paying attention to certain</text>
  <text start="214.959" dur="7.11">politicians or they haven&amp;#39;t been paying</text>
  <text start="217.989" dur="7.021">attention at all because they had no</text>
  <text start="222.069" dur="5.461">interest in it and this is why Trump and</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="6.119">the Patriots they need to make the</text>
  <text start="227.53" dur="6.929">people understand that the private West</text>
  <text start="231.129" dur="6.901">a central bank that is the main problem</text>

  <text start="238.03" dur="7.109">people into the fold who&amp;#39;ve never been</text>
  <text start="241.989" dur="7.441">in the fold who really haven&amp;#39;t paid</text>
  <text start="245.139" dur="6.901">attention or they believe that the</text>
  <text start="249.43" dur="5.669">central bank system is working to the</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="6.15">benefit of the people you have to show</text>
  <text start="255.099" dur="7.581">them you have to show the people what&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="308.59" dur="7.2">want to know who&amp;#39;s responsible for that</text>
  <text start="312.36" dur="6.01">that&amp;#39;s why Trump has been building this</text>
  <text start="315.79" dur="4.26">up now that&amp;#39;s not the only reason he</text>

  <text start="337.78" dur="4.38">parallel to the central bank system we</text>
  <text start="340.419" dur="3.331">saw this back in the 60s we had the</text>
  <text start="342.16" dur="5.58">petro dollar system being built and</text>
  <text start="343.75" dur="6.72">we&amp;#39;re on the gold standard until 1971</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="4.679">when they switched him well this time</text>
  <text start="350.47" dur="6.6">around they&amp;#39;re just gonna switch him</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="8.281">back but guess what this time it will</text>
  <text start="357.07" dur="8.04">benefit the people this time people will</text>
  <text start="360.7" dur="7.05">realize who is responsible for all the</text>
  <text start="365.11" dur="5.279">poverty for the wealth gap for</text>
  <text start="367.75" dur="5.82">everything that&amp;#39;s been done these these</text>
  <text start="370.389" dur="5.671">up and down cycles that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="373.57" dur="6.63">experienced throughout our lives the</text>
  <text start="376.06" dur="7.32">Great Recession of 2008 2009 they will</text>
  <text start="380.2" dur="6.24">understand and they will know who is</text>
  <text start="383.38" dur="5.969">responsible and who caused all of this</text>
  <text start="386.44" dur="5.61">and this is what Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="389.349" dur="6.451">are doing this is why Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="6.48">the following just out median household</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="7.2">income is at the highest point ever ever</text>
  <text start="398.53" dur="7.29">ever how about saying it this way in the</text>
  <text start="403" dur="5.52">history of our country also more people</text>
  <text start="405.82" dur="4.849">working today in the USA than at any</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="4.26">time in history</text>
  <text start="410.669" dur="6.97">tough numbers for the radical left</text>
  <text start="412.78" dur="9.53">Democrats to be impeach the president he</text>
  <text start="417.639" dur="7.171">just made the entire economic system</text>
  <text start="422.31" dur="5.829">incredible people</text>
  <text start="424.81" dur="6.93">this they feel it they know it now we</text>
  <text start="428.139" dur="6.421">know that this is a lot of stats that</text>
  <text start="431.74" dur="5.28">are being brought out by Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.56" dur="3.72">using the same exact weapons that the</text>
  <text start="437.02" dur="3.51">central bank the mainstream media has</text>
  <text start="438.28" dur="5.81">been using but what he&amp;#39;s been doing his</text>
  <text start="440.53" dur="7.08">bit he&amp;#39;s been creating a lot of jobs for</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="5.65">minorities and what they&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="5.55">is they&amp;#39;re an unemployment numbers going</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="7.56">down their wages going up and this is</text>
  <text start="453.16" dur="7.979">why he&amp;#39;s moving in this direction to</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="6.839">close the wealth gap now right on</text>
  <text start="461.139" dur="4.131">schedule and this is all according to</text>
  <text start="464.139" dur="5.221">the Patriots plan</text>
  <text start="465.27" dur="7.93">the IMF came out and said listen there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.36" dur="5.91">a synchronized global slowdown this is</text>
  <text start="473.2" dur="8.13">the weakest we&amp;#39;ve ever seen in our life</text>
  <text start="475.27" dur="10.95">and it&amp;#39;s because of the trade wars so</text>
  <text start="481.33" dur="6.75">already they fell into the trap this is</text>
  <text start="486.22" dur="4.73">exactly what Trump and the Patriots want</text>
  <text start="488.08" dur="7.459">they want the private west central bank</text>
  <text start="490.95" dur="7.36">to say why the system slowing down</text>
  <text start="495.539" dur="6.431">because they&amp;#39;re gonna get caught up in</text>
  <text start="498.31" dur="5.94">their lies and you can see how this is</text>
  <text start="501.97" dur="4.56">all being set up now if you go back in</text>
  <text start="504.25" dur="5.25">time and you look at the IMF global</text>
  <text start="506.53" dur="11.819">economic growth outlook and you go back</text>
  <text start="509.5" dur="12.86">to the year 2011 2012 2013 2014 guess</text>
  <text start="518.349" dur="7.651">what the global economic growth outlook</text>
  <text start="522.36" dur="7.09">was awful it only popped up when Trump</text>
  <text start="526" dur="6.959">came into office and then it slid right</text>
  <text start="529.45" dur="8.009">back down again and if you go back in</text>
  <text start="532.959" dur="8.511">time to the 90s to the 2000s every time</text>
  <text start="537.459" dur="7.081">we had a recession the global economic</text>
  <text start="541.47" dur="4.98">growth outlook was much lower so this is</text>
  <text start="544.54" dur="4.34">not out of the ordinary</text>
  <text start="546.45" dur="5.8">this is something that we&amp;#39;ve seen before</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="5.98">when the central bankers decided to have</text>
  <text start="552.25" dur="6.57">a recession</text>
  <text start="554.86" dur="7.73">this time they&amp;#39;re not deciding it this</text>
  <text start="558.82" dur="8.31">time their system is breaking down</text>
  <text start="562.59" dur="7.87">because we are at the end stage of the</text>
  <text start="567.13" dur="5.55">central bank system and there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="570.46" dur="5.07">they can do they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="572.68" dur="5.73">world economy faces difficult headwinds</text>
  <text start="575.53" dur="5.37">the global growth estimate for 2019 was</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="5.49">as high as three point nine percent mid</text>
  <text start="580.9" dur="5.67">2018 but the latest report suggests the</text>
  <text start="583.9" dur="4.62">world economy will grow three percent</text>
  <text start="586.57" dur="4.35">this year down from three point two</text>
  <text start="588.52" dur="3.78">percent seen in July with the 2020</text>
  <text start="590.92" dur="4.29">estimate lower to three point four</text>
  <text start="592.3" dur="5.94">percent now you need to understand the</text>
  <text start="595.21" dur="7.38">IMF always projects very high numbers</text>
  <text start="598.24" dur="7.35">then they backtrack so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="602.59" dur="5.22">talking about right now and that when</text>
  <text start="605.59" dur="4.92">they say is synchronized slowed down in</text>
  <text start="607.81" dur="7.35">an uncertain recovery they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="610.51" dur="8.16">about their system which is imploding</text>
  <text start="615.16" dur="7.08">right in front of our eyes and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="618.67" dur="6.78">blaming it on the trade war now when</text>
  <text start="622.24" dur="5.52">Trump makes this deal he&amp;#39;s completed</text>
  <text start="625.45" dur="4.2">phase one when he moves into Phase two</text>
  <text start="627.76" dur="3.42">and of course I hear all over the</text>
  <text start="629.65" dur="3.84">mainstream media that phase one is not</text>
  <text start="631.18" dur="6.57">really a big deal of course it&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="633.49" dur="6.9">deal we got through phase one China</text>
  <text start="637.75" dur="5.34">agreed they might backtrack a little bit</text>
  <text start="640.39" dur="7.05">but eventually with what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="643.09" dur="6.66">China the US has the leverage with food</text>
  <text start="647.44" dur="5.64">with pork and their crops and everything</text>
  <text start="649.75" dur="5.58">else they know this and we need to</text>
  <text start="653.08" dur="6.54">remember that negotiations there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="655.33" dur="7.91">always a push and a pull and a pull and</text>
  <text start="659.62" dur="5.88">a push until you meet in the middle and</text>
  <text start="663.24" dur="7.15">this is what we see happening right now</text>
  <text start="665.5" dur="7.77">and Trump is in no rush anyhow the</text>
  <text start="670.39" dur="6.3">tariffs are in place companies are</text>
  <text start="673.27" dur="6.21">moving out companies are saying listen</text>
  <text start="676.69" dur="3.45">if this keeps up we can&amp;#39;t stay here that</text>
  <text start="679.48" dur="2.28">much longer</text>
  <text start="680.14" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re either have to move to a different</text>
  <text start="681.76" dur="6.3">country or come back to the United</text>
  <text start="683.86" dur="6.72">States he rather have that happen</text>
  <text start="688.06" dur="7.05">and then make the deal he&amp;#39;s in no rush</text>
  <text start="690.58" dur="9.66">its 2019 he asked 2020 to make this deal</text>
  <text start="695.11" dur="9.48">and once this deal is made and there is</text>
  <text start="700.24" dur="6.15">no trade war and the global economy does</text>
  <text start="704.59" dur="3.9">not improve because as you can see out</text>
  <text start="706.39" dur="6.18">in Europe with negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="708.49" dur="7.44">with stimulus with the way the countries</text>
  <text start="712.57" dur="8.73">look in in the in the European Union</text>
  <text start="715.93" dur="8.16">Germany Spain Italy France this has</text>
  <text start="721.3" dur="6.47">nothing to do with the trade wars this</text>
  <text start="724.09" dur="6.69">has to do with the central bank system</text>
  <text start="727.77" dur="7.87">imploding on itself the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="730.78" dur="7.86">setting them up and they&amp;#39;re buying into</text>
  <text start="735.64" dur="6.36">it and they&amp;#39;re going along with what the</text>
  <text start="738.64" dur="5.82">Patriots want them to do there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="742" dur="3.9">out for them there&amp;#39;s gonna not gonna be</text>
  <text start="744.46" dur="4.17">an event there&amp;#39;s not gonna be a war</text>
  <text start="745.9" dur="5.97">actually with the Middle East</text>
  <text start="748.63" dur="4.41">breaking down with the Middle East when</text>
  <text start="751.87" dur="3.81">I say breaking down I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="753.04" dur="5.7">that Trump is breaking everything down</text>
