  <text start="205.06" dur="6.209">refugees into the country and that is</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="5.43">about it in germany what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="216.939" dur="6.901">their stay in denmark they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="221.019" dur="5.61">to do the same thing and they they have</text>
  <text start="223.84" dur="4.95">a controversial bill and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="226.629" dur="4.381">okay we&amp;#39;re going to take your funds your</text>
  <text start="228.79" dur="5.059">valuables and if you want to stay in the</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="6.99">country you we will need to take these</text>
  <text start="233.849" dur="6.191">so cash holdings and valuables can be</text>
  <text start="238" dur="3.87">secured by authorities if they are over</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="3.809">seven hundred and fifty euros which is</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="4.769">eight hundred and ten dollars and if the</text>
  <text start="243.849" dur="5.941">person has an outstanding bill or is</text>
  <text start="246.639" dur="4.801">expected to have one they&amp;#39;re saying by</text>
  <text start="249.79" dur="3.809">confiscating the personal belongings of</text>
  <text start="251.44" dur="4.769">refugees the states are implementing</text>
  <text start="253.599" dur="4.5">federal laws that require asylum seekers</text>
  <text start="256.209" dur="6.631">to use up their own resources before</text>
  <text start="258.099" dur="9.271">receiving state aid now we we know that</text>
  <text start="262.84" dur="7.98">turkey released all these refugees to</text>
  <text start="267.37" dur="6.12">cause major problems with it with</text>
  <text start="270.82" dur="4.92">throughout Europe and this was done on</text>
  <text start="273.49" dur="3.69">purpose under the instructions of the</text>
  <text start="275.74" dur="4.2">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="277.18" dur="4.5">because we know over the years Turkey</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="4.38">has been building and building up</text>
  <text start="281.68" dur="5.519">refugees keeping them there waiting for</text>
  <text start="284.32" dur="5.129">the right moment to do this and many</text>
  <text start="287.199" dur="5.701">people say this is a one part of the</text>
  <text start="289.449" dur="5.97">agenda is to blur the cultural and</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="5.46">national identity of the countries</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="4.71">another one is to get Europe</text>
  <text start="298.36" dur="5.67">more involved in what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="300.129" dur="7.26">Syria a way to push them to bring troops</text>
  <text start="304.03" dur="7.949">in so we can stop the refugees and we</text>
  <text start="307.389" dur="7.351">see that this is breaking the eurozone</text>
  <text start="311.979" dur="5.701">completely apart each country now is</text>
  <text start="314.74" dur="5.34">saying listen the Schengen out the</text>
  <text start="317.68" dur="6.18">window we are going to be controlling</text>
  <text start="320.08" dur="7.32">the borders at this point now out in</text>
  <text start="323.86" dur="6.989">Libya it seems that they have three</text>
  <text start="327.4" dur="6.96">governments now and one is enough but</text>
  <text start="330.849" dur="6.391">three Wow they have the one in Tripoli</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="5.279">they have the one in Tunisia and they</text>
  <text start="337.24" dur="3.78">have the one off to the east which is</text>
  <text start="339.639" dur="4.261">the puppet government Isis government</text>
  <text start="341.02" dur="6.929">central bankers and we have all three of</text>
  <text start="343.9" dur="5.789">these but the only government that</text>
  <text start="347.949" dur="4.53">really exists is the one in Tripoli</text>
  <text start="349.689" dur="6.151">under the Constitution all the others</text>
  <text start="352.479" dur="6.391">are fake all the others were created by</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="5.49">the UN the United States who wants to</text>
  <text start="358.87" dur="4.139">get back into Libya and they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="361.33" dur="3.239">major problem doing this they thought oh</text>
  <text start="363.009" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;ll just create this unity government</text>
  <text start="364.569" dur="4.291">but they never really talked to the</text>
  <text start="367.029" dur="4.081">government Ripley actually they rejected</text>
  <text start="368.86" dur="4.83">the plan but they still went forward</text>
  <text start="371.11" dur="5.489">with it because they don&amp;#39;t care what</text>
  <text start="373.69" dur="7.649">they think they need to get back into</text>
  <text start="376.599" dur="9.021">Libya period and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="381.339" dur="8.85">the US military along with the allies</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="9.34">they are getting ready for decisive</text>
  <text start="390.189" dur="7.65">action inside of Libya now remember this</text>
  <text start="394.96" dur="5.19">didn&amp;#39;t come out of nowhere they just</text>
  <text start="397.839" dur="4.86">didn&amp;#39;t decide how you know what let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="408.009" dur="5.701">happen to have all the military assets</text>
  <text start="410.05" dur="5.16">on standby and we have this plan ready</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="5.479">to go no this was planned from the</text>
  <text start="415.21" dur="9.66">beginning we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on this</text>
  <text start="419.189" dur="9.431">showing that the US UK Italy Egypt</text>
  <text start="424.87" dur="6.409">France preparing for this for a very</text>
  <text start="428.62" dur="2.659">long time</text>
  <text start="431.34" dur="4.02">these are the things that we look at</text>
  <text start="432.81" dur="4.8">this is what we are looking at to see</text>
  <text start="435.36" dur="4.14">what exactly are they doing and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.61" dur="3.809">trying to make it seem like the Islamic</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="4.56">state just appeared out of nowhere and</text>
  <text start="441.419" dur="4.761">now we need to go back into Libya well</text>
  <text start="444.06" dur="5.579">no they didn&amp;#39;t appear out of nowhere as</text>
  <text start="446.18" dur="6.07">they were losing the battle in syria</text>
  <text start="449.639" dur="5.971">because of russian forces Qatar Turkey</text>
  <text start="452.25" dur="5.52">the United States Saudi Arabia they were</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="4.97">airlifting the Islamic state out of</text>
  <text start="457.77" dur="6.48">Syria and bringing them into Libya</text>
  <text start="460.58" dur="7.45">because guess what Russia cut off their</text>
  <text start="464.25" dur="7.04">funding so what they do they went into</text>
  <text start="468.03" dur="6.48">Libya and they went into the oil</text>
  <text start="471.29" dur="6.52">refineries the ports and they took</text>
  <text start="474.51" dur="6.629">control there to basically fund their</text>
  <text start="477.81" dur="7.65">operations and when the people of Libya</text>
  <text start="481.139" dur="7.111">decided hey this can&amp;#39;t happen and they</text>
  <text start="485.46" dur="4.47">started to attack the Islamic state the</text>
  <text start="488.25" dur="3.69">news broke that the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="489.93" dur="3.84">attacking the oil refineries know they</text>
  <text start="491.94" dur="4.88">were given to the Islamic state so they</text>
  <text start="493.77" dur="7.47">can continue their funding in Libya and</text>
  <text start="496.82" dur="6.88">they tried to move into the Tripoli area</text>
  <text start="501.24" dur="5.34">to get more and more refineries more and</text>
  <text start="503.7" dur="7.37">more oil to fund their operations and</text>
  <text start="506.58" dur="7.86">they&amp;#39;re using this this whole propaganda</text>
  <text start="511.07" dur="5.56">scenario to go back into Libya and this</text>
  <text start="514.44" dur="5.88">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we see</text>
  <text start="516.63" dur="7.11">the u.s. is pushing forth troops into</text>
  <text start="520.32" dur="5.1">Iraq and into Syria the US State</text>
  <text start="523.74" dur="5.039">Department right now warned that muscle</text>
  <text start="525.42" dur="5.31">damn could collapse if the required</text>
  <text start="528.779" dur="4.291">resources are not available so the water</text>
  <text start="530.73" dur="5.1">will immerse many cities including</text>
  <text start="533.07" dur="4.47">Tikrit Samara muscle and it will</text>
  <text start="535.83" dur="4.55">displace hundreds of thousands of people</text>
  <text start="537.54" dur="6.39">and they&amp;#39;re trying to push this agenda</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="5.62">so everyone understands why they need to</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="6.93">bring in more troops into this area</text>
  <text start="546" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;re trying to make their case and we</text>
  <text start="550.86" dur="4.11">see already they&amp;#39;re accelerating boots</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="4.32">on the ground this is of course the</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="4.2">strategy to get the Islamic state but we</text>
  <text start="556.86" dur="4.05">know for a fact this is not the strategy</text>
  <text start="559.17" dur="4.86">to get to the to the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="560.91" dur="3.84">whatsoever this strategy is to bring</text>
  <text start="564.03" dur="3.36">more and more</text>
  <text start="564.75" dur="7.68">ground troops into this area and you</text>
  <text start="567.39" dur="9.38">have to ask why well Russia basically</text>
  <text start="572.43" dur="8.55">created a no-fly zone over Syria and</text>
  <text start="576.77" dur="7.87">they have trouble flying to the west</text>
  <text start="580.98" dur="6.57">they have trouble flying in the northern</text>
  <text start="584.64" dur="6.57">areas they still can fly a little bit in</text>
  <text start="587.55" dur="6.65">the southern areas because if Russia</text>
  <text start="591.21" dur="7.77">spots them hitting the infrastructure of</text>
  <text start="594.2" dur="7.21">Syria guess what&amp;#39;s going to happen Assad</text>
  <text start="598.98" dur="5.24">forces Russian forces they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="601.41" dur="5.84">shoot down these planes they know it and</text>
  <text start="604.22" dur="5.86">they&amp;#39;re going to be caught destroying</text>
  <text start="607.25" dur="6.01">infrastructure so they&amp;#39;re coming up with</text>
  <text start="610.08" dur="6.18">a new strategy their strategy is a safe</text>
  <text start="613.26" dur="6.36">zone their strategy is to bring in</text>
  <text start="616.26" dur="8.96">ground troops their strategy is a ground</text>
  <text start="619.62" dur="10.13">war at this time this is the new</text>
  <text start="625.22" dur="8.14">strategy now we realize that the US and</text>
  <text start="629.75" dur="5.65">Turkey they have been talking about</text>
  <text start="633.36" dur="3.72">securing the borders between Turkey and</text>
  <text start="635.4" dur="4.14">Syria for a very long time and this is</text>
  <text start="637.08" dur="6.72">the first step into creating a safe zone</text>
  <text start="639.54" dur="6.77">and we see right now John Kerry is out</text>
  <text start="643.8" dur="6.63">there saying that the us-led coalition</text>
  <text start="646.31" dur="9.13">has almost full control of the</text>
  <text start="650.43" dur="7.83">turkish-syrian border and the reason why</text>
  <text start="655.44" dur="5.28">they need control of this is they need</text>
  <text start="658.26" dur="4.89">to make sure that the Islamic state can</text>
  <text start="660.72" dur="4.98">move in and out easily they have full</text>
  <text start="663.15" dur="5.79">control over it they&amp;#39;re moving into</text>
  <text start="665.7" dur="7.29">Syria and increasing the amount of</text>
  <text start="668.94" dur="8.91">territory that they&amp;#39;re taking and they</text>
  <text start="672.99" dur="7.38">realize that Russia is helping Syria</text>
  <text start="677.85" dur="7.35">take over many of the bordering towns</text>
  <text start="680.37" dur="8.4">and they&amp;#39;re liberating them and sooner</text>
  <text start="685.2" dur="6.6">than later the Syrian forces are all</text>
  <text start="688.77" dur="6.12">going to occupy these areas which are</text>
  <text start="691.8" dur="6.27">very close to the border and Turkey</text>
  <text start="694.89" dur="3.72">right now they are watching the Russian</text>
  <text start="698.07" dur="2.94">military</text>
  <text start="698.61" dur="6.33">very closely as it approaches their</text>
  <text start="701.01" dur="5.94">border and they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="704.94" dur="3.69">going to keep an eye on this because</text>
  <text start="706.95" dur="5.22">they want to see what they&amp;#39;re doing what</text>
  <text start="708.63" dur="6.449">they&amp;#39;re planning and we see right now</text>
  <text start="712.17" dur="4.89">that turkey along with the United States</text>
  <text start="715.079" dur="9.44">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="717.06" dur="12.44">planning a ground invasion into Syria</text>
  <text start="724.519" dur="7.991">already they have taken territory and</text>
  <text start="729.5" dur="7.18">they have invaded Syria the Syrian</text>
  <text start="732.51" dur="7.56">government has formally appealed to the</text>
  <text start="736.68" dur="7.469">United Nations over incursions into its</text>
  <text start="740.07" dur="6.18">territory by Turkish troops and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="744.149" dur="4.5">saying they are bringing their troops</text>
  <text start="746.25" dur="5.48">into Syria without permission of the</text>
  <text start="748.649" dur="7.201">Syrian government and they&amp;#39;re firing at</text>
  <text start="751.73" dur="6.609">certain targets and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="755.85" dur="4.47">Turkish military actions inside Syria</text>
  <text start="758.339" dur="4.86">threatens to escalate the internal</text>

  <text start="769.32" dur="4.74">close to this town called jarabe &amp;#39;less</text>
  <text start="772.13" dur="4.17">because that is still under the control</text>
  <text start="774.06" dur="7.95">of the Islamic state and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="776.3" dur="9.099">bringing in military assets they</text>

  <text start="797.04" dur="6.75">everything is in order for this next</text>
  <text start="799.22" dur="6.88">offensive and it&amp;#39;s getting tougher and</text>

  <text start="816.899" dur="5.721">further and further east and these talks</text>
  <text start="819.6" dur="7.049">at this point are kind of meaningless</text>
  <text start="822.62" dur="6.459">because Russia and Syria are going to</text>
  <text start="826.649" dur="3.81">have this whole area clean very very</text>
  <text start="829.079" dur="3.091">soon and the United States government</text>
  <text start="830.459" dur="4.291">central bankers they realized</text>
  <text start="832.17" dur="4.8">right now Russian airstrikes they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="834.75" dur="4.86">helped the Syrian government forces to</text>

  <text start="839.61" dur="6.659">of 15 for the first time since 2011</text>
  <text start="844.07" dur="4.209">right now the Syrian Army is preparing</text>
  <text start="846.269" dur="6.5">military operations in three more</text>
  <text start="848.279" dur="8.37">directions so they have the upper hand</text>
  <text start="852.769" dur="7.901">the u.s. turkey the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="856.649" dur="5.761">they don&amp;#39;t and they know this right now</text>

  <text start="865.019" dur="4.5">not going to negotiate because of what</text>
  <text start="867.54" dur="4.919">Rush is doing they need to stop their</text>
  <text start="869.519" dur="6.51">air strikes first and once they stopped</text>
  <text start="872.459" dur="5.041">because they&amp;#39;re killing civilians they</text>
  <text start="876.029" dur="4.231">need to stop this and then we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="877.5" dur="6.87">now what they&amp;#39;re really saying is Russia</text>

  <text start="892.05" dur="6.62">have talks with you so we know right now</text>
  <text start="895.26" dur="6.48">that the u.s. only wanted the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="898.67" dur="6.57">to regroup this is their whole point of</text>
  <text start="901.74" dur="6.06">it and like I said we knew eventually</text>

  <text start="947.25" dur="3.779">at the situation very very closely</text>
  <text start="948.54" dur="4.52">because the United States they are</text>

  <text start="1075.44" dur="6.39">the United States or throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="1077.78" dur="8.19">to show that the Islamic state is still</text>
  <text start="1081.83" dur="5.81">very dangerous that we need to go into</text>
