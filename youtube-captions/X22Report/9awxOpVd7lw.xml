  <text start="102.119" dur="5.631">recover Hillary emails they were</text>
  <text start="104.039" dur="8.19">sufficient enough and threw the case out</text>
  <text start="107.75" dur="7.479">the door but DC Circuit Judge Steven</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="5.25">Williams a Ronald Reagan appointee well</text>
  <text start="115.229" dur="6.39">he had a little bit of a different view</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="7.681">and we see that he looked at this and</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="6.39">said well maybe there is something here</text>
  <text start="125.16" dur="5.909">the three-judge appeals court panel on</text>

  <text start="149.64" dur="4.98">in the court&amp;#39;s opinion it is therefore</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="5.33">abundantly clear that in terms of</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="4.41">assuring government recovery of emails</text>
  <text start="156.95" dur="7.149">appellants have not been given</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="8.25">everything they asked for so we can see</text>
  <text start="164.099" dur="6.03">right now that judicial watch president</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="4.56">tom fitton praised the ruling saying</text>
  <text start="170.129" dur="3.901">that it is now up to the trump</text>
  <text start="171.84" dur="4.32">administration to determine whether they</text>
  <text start="174.03" dur="5.33">would like to finally enforce the rule</text>
  <text start="176.16" dur="6.54">of law and try to retrieve all the email</text>
  <text start="179.36" dur="7.18">all the emails from clinton and r8</text>
  <text start="182.7" dur="6.179">and the bowl right now is in Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="5.16">court he can hand this over to the</text>
  <text start="188.879" dur="5.22">Attorney General and let the Attorney</text>
  <text start="191.7" dur="5.34">General run with this well we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="194.099" dur="5.461">wait and see how this turns out now we</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="6.72">understand that the establishment the</text>
  <text start="199.56" dur="6.57">elite the central bank&amp;#39;s Obama they are</text>
  <text start="203.76" dur="4.949">trying to shut down the alternative</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="4.8">media anything outside of their control</text>
  <text start="208.709" dur="3.741">they want to completely shut down this</text>
  <text start="210.93" dur="6.57">is why they came up with the fake news</text>
  <text start="212.45" dur="6.61">the whole fake news idea that if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.5" dur="3.41">not coming from the corporate media it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="6.239">all fake and we have to have</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="6.97">fact-checking individuals websites</text>
  <text start="225.299" dur="5.931">companies to do the research to make</text>
  <text start="227.88" dur="5.34">sure that these stories are real and</text>
  <text start="231.23" dur="4.78">facebook said okay you know we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="7.01">to create this algorithm we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="236.01" dur="7.77">use different websites to fact-check and</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="7.349">it looks like Facebook&amp;#39;s algorithm their</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="8.22">fake news system when a little haywire</text>
  <text start="247.579" dur="7.06">because Facebook activated a false</text>
  <text start="252" dur="5.34">safety check for an explosion in the</text>
  <text start="254.639" dur="5.671">city of Bangkok Thailand after its</text>
  <text start="257.34" dur="5.579">algorithm was fooled by trending posts</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="8.669">apparently related to the 2015 deadly</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="7.381">bombing at the erwin shrine a series of</text>
  <text start="268.979" dur="3.66">posts suggesting that there was an</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="4.38">explosion the city triggered the safety</text>
  <text start="272.639" dur="5.671">check on December 26 around nine p.m.</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="7.02">local time and it was asking users in</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="5.79">Thailand to mark themselves safe well</text>
  <text start="281.7" dur="5.88">there is no media sources to back this</text>
  <text start="284.1" dur="9.2">up there was no information to back any</text>
  <text start="287.58" dur="9.93">of this up and this was a real story and</text>
  <text start="293.3" dur="7.179">we come to find out that no it wasn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="297.51" dur="5.19">was completely fake and this brings up a</text>
  <text start="300.479" dur="6.141">lot of questions about how these systems</text>
  <text start="302.7" dur="8.94">are going to be run because we know that</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="7.45">the sites like snobs PolitiFact and all</text>
  <text start="311.64" dur="4.769">the rest well they&amp;#39;re run by the CIA</text>
  <text start="314.07" dur="2.52">they&amp;#39;re funded by Soros they&amp;#39;re funded</text>
  <text start="316.409" dur="5.091">by</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="7.08">gates and they&amp;#39;re all interconnected and</text>
  <text start="321.5" dur="4.15">basically what&amp;#39;s happening right now is</text>
  <text start="323.67" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re setting up what&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="325.65" dur="4.95">Ministry of Truth these are the facts</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="4.98">that we want you to believe and I always</text>
  <text start="330.6" dur="4.5">go back to everything that we&amp;#39;ve seen in</text>
  <text start="332.91" dur="4.02">the past because if the alternative</text>
  <text start="335.1" dur="4.5">media was out there or anyone out there</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="5.52">writing an article about Obamacare for</text>
  <text start="339.6" dur="5.25">instance the Affordable Care Act which</text>
  <text start="342.45" dur="3.99">we know is not affordable where people</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="3.57">were writing during that time period</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="4.71">because I remember reading the articles</text>
  <text start="348.42" dur="4.47">that you&amp;#39;re going to lose your doctor</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="3.54">you will not be able to keep your doctor</text>
  <text start="352.89" dur="4.11">now of course Obama came out and made a</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="7.17">speech saying you will be able to keep</text>
  <text start="357" dur="10.08">her doctor well his story because he</text>
  <text start="361.86" dur="6.6">said it well that was the fact and the</text>
  <text start="367.08" dur="3.84">other story that said you were going to</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="4.2">lose your doc your doctor well that</text>
  <text start="370.92" dur="5.04">would have been fake news but actually</text>
  <text start="372.66" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s the opposite when Obama came out</text>
  <text start="375.96" dur="3.48">and said premiums are going to be very</text>
  <text start="377.31" dur="7.71">low everyone&amp;#39;s going to be able to</text>
  <text start="379.44" dur="7.05">afford this well we looked at it there</text>
  <text start="385.02" dur="4.17">were articles written saying that no</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="5.61">premiums are going to rise companies are</text>
  <text start="389.19" dur="6.66">going to cut down on full-time positions</text>
  <text start="392.1" dur="5.97">and make them part time now again if we</text>
  <text start="395.85" dur="4.44">looked at that these two stories at that</text>
  <text start="398.07" dur="4.17">time the government story would have in</text>
  <text start="400.29" dur="3.66">fact and these other stories would have</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="4.74">been fake but again it was the other way</text>
  <text start="403.95" dur="4.59">around in 2011 when the government came</text>
  <text start="406.98" dur="3.12">out and said we are not backing the</text>
  <text start="408.54" dur="3.24">moderate rebels we&amp;#39;re not funding them</text>
  <text start="410.1" dur="4.71">we have nothing to do with these</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="5.67">individuals turns out that yes they did</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="4.68">they were supplying them arms they were</text>
  <text start="417.45" dur="5.97">funding them actually it wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="7.65">moderate rebels it was Al Qaeda at the</text>
  <text start="423.42" dur="6.39">time and again those individuals like</text>
  <text start="427.14" dur="4.77">myself who were saying that these are</text>
  <text start="429.81" dur="3.69">terrorists these are al-qaeda the United</text>
  <text start="431.91" dur="4.14">States is funding them that would have</text>
  <text start="433.5" dur="4.68">been fake and once again the government</text>
  <text start="436.05" dur="5.28">would have been fact but again it was</text>
  <text start="438.18" dur="6.05">the other way around go back to two</text>
  <text start="441.33" dur="4.89">thousand eight in a financial crisis the</text>
  <text start="444.23" dur="5.86">central bank told us they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="446.22" dur="6.84">forecasting a recession in 2008</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="5.72">while we were in 2008 that would have</text>
  <text start="453.06" dur="4.95">been fact the government backed it up</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="4.9">all those other people is that know</text>
  <text start="458.01" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re heading towards this crash it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="7.05">going to be a disaster that&amp;#39;s fake news</text>
  <text start="463.53" dur="8.34">but again it was the other way around so</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="6.78">again what is fake what is real the</text>
  <text start="471.87" dur="4.71">government wants you to believe that</text>
  <text start="474.54" dur="5.31">everything they say is real but it is</text>
  <text start="476.58" dur="5.01">not and we see this as spreading we know</text>
  <text start="479.85" dur="4.11">that Engle amirul she&amp;#39;s in her election</text>
  <text start="481.59" dur="8.16">year in 2017 she&amp;#39;s going to be setting</text>
  <text start="483.96" dur="8.459">up her own center of defense against</text>
  <text start="489.75" dur="6.6">fake news how interesting during an</text>
  <text start="492.419" dur="7.161">election year shut down all those sites</text>
  <text start="496.35" dur="6.18">all those people that are spewing out</text>
  <text start="499.58" dur="6.19">information that goes against what she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.53" dur="5.43">saying during an election year look do</text>
  <text start="505.77" dur="5.88">you see the pattern here do you see what</text>
  <text start="507.96" dur="7.069">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re shutting down</text>
  <text start="511.65" dur="6.99">those people who are not in agreement</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="5.5">with the government who might be</text>
  <text start="518.64" dur="4.29">pointing out certain things during an</text>
  <text start="520.529" dur="5.671">election year that they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="522.93" dur="5.79">anyone to see this is how these</text>
  <text start="526.2" dur="5.67">individuals work they don&amp;#39;t want freedom</text>
  <text start="528.72" dur="7.59">of speech they don&amp;#39;t want democracy they</text>
  <text start="531.87" dur="7.38">want control they want to rule and they</text>
  <text start="536.31" dur="7.05">don&amp;#39;t want the people to have any type</text>
  <text start="539.25" dur="9.35">of say that&amp;#39;s what these individuals are</text>
  <text start="543.36" dur="8.34">really like we see out in the UK the UK</text>
  <text start="548.6" dur="5.71">they were looking into voter fraud they</text>
  <text start="551.7" dur="6.09">were looking into the voting system and</text>
  <text start="554.31" dur="6.8">they&amp;#39;ve came up with an idea to get rid</text>
  <text start="557.79" dur="8.46">of all of it you will have to show ID as</text>
  <text start="561.11" dur="7.69">part of their new electoral system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="566.25" dur="4.11">funny because throughout the world you</text>
  <text start="568.8" dur="2.789">have to show your ID for everything to</text>
  <text start="570.36" dur="4.44">get into a country have to show your</text>
  <text start="571.589" dur="4.951">passport to get on a plane if you</text>
  <text start="574.8" dur="4.98">stopped by the police you need to show</text>
  <text start="576.54" dur="5.91">ID but to go vote for an individual</text>
  <text start="579.78" dur="4.23">who&amp;#39;s going to run your country you</text>
  <text start="582.45" dur="3.98">don&amp;#39;t have to show any ID</text>
  <text start="584.01" dur="5.67">actually this will get rid of a lot</text>
  <text start="586.43" dur="6.82">because it would be one person one ID</text>
  <text start="589.68" dur="7.76">anyone else coming in guess what this</text>
  <text start="593.25" dur="7.14">person already checked in who are you</text>
  <text start="597.44" dur="6.25">but again those people who manipulate</text>
  <text start="600.39" dur="6.87">elections those people who manipulate</text>
  <text start="603.69" dur="6.6">and try to stay in power they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="607.26" dur="6.48">this type of accountability they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="610.29" dur="5.76">like it and they try to make everyone</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="4.56">convinced that oh if we show voter ID</text>
  <text start="616.05" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s against freedoms as it well if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.3" dur="3.93">against freedoms then we should get rid</text>
  <text start="619.74" dur="5.27">of showing ID at the airport showing ID</text>
  <text start="622.23" dur="6.63">every time you go into an amusement park</text>
  <text start="625.01" dur="6.34">into a stadium we shouldn&amp;#39;t be searched</text>
  <text start="628.86" dur="3.87">every single time because that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="631.35" dur="5.07">violation of our rights so if you really</text>
  <text start="632.73" dur="8.96">want to take it that much further look</text>
  <text start="636.42" dur="7.26">what they&amp;#39;ve done no showing your ID</text>
  <text start="641.69" dur="5.38">doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re giving up your</text>
  <text start="643.68" dur="7.95">freedom to vote for someone it shows</text>
  <text start="647.07" dur="6.84">that you gave your vote and check yes we</text>

  <text start="763.08" dur="5.58">included in this and the only thing that</text>
  <text start="766.23" dur="4.38">Turkey asked was that if we have a</text>
  <text start="768.66" dur="4.8">ceasefire and we go into peace talks</text>
  <text start="770.61" dur="7.53">Assad cannot be in power so it looks</text>
  <text start="773.46" dur="7.2">like that Turkey is playing both sides</text>
  <text start="778.14" dur="4.56">still moving closer to Russia still</text>
  <text start="780.66" dur="5.22">pushing the idea that Assad can&amp;#39;t be in</text>
  <text start="782.7" dur="7.41">power but the people of Syria are going</text>
  <text start="785.88" dur="7.2">to look towards Assad and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="790.11" dur="5.34">to say well wait a minute Assad was with</text>
  <text start="793.08" dur="5.73">us since the beginning he brought in</text>
  <text start="795.45" dur="6.18">Russia to help we&amp;#39;ve beaten the Islamic</text>
  <text start="798.81" dur="5.67">state why should why should we remove</text>
  <text start="801.63" dur="6.39">this leader right now it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="804.48" dur="8.39">any sense but we can see that Russia has</text>
  <text start="808.02" dur="7.74">used Turkey has used this situation to</text>
  <text start="812.87" dur="4.3">create a ceasefire right now which means</text>
  <text start="815.76" dur="3.09">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="817.17" dur="4.47">bankers while their backs are against</text>
  <text start="818.85" dur="4.89">the wall and we could see that more</text>
  <text start="821.64" dur="4.83">weaponry is coming into the Kurds there</text>
  <text start="823.74" dur="6.09">they want a division in Syria that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="826.47" dur="6.93">their main plan and we see that Obama</text>
  <text start="829.83" dur="6.75">well he&amp;#39;s not going to give up he only</text>
  <text start="833.4" dur="5.52">has a couple of weeks left as president</text>
  <text start="836.58" dur="5.34">and we already see that Obama is set to</text>
  <text start="838.92" dur="6.9">announce economic sanctions and a covert</text>
  <text start="841.92" dur="6.39">cyber ops to hit Russia with a cyber</text>
  <text start="845.82" dur="4.9">attack now remember all of this is being</text>
  <text start="848.31" dur="4.81">done without evidence</text>
  <text start="850.72" dur="5.489">CIA produce no evidence Congress asked</text>
  <text start="853.12" dur="5.909">the CIA to present their evidence they</text>
  <text start="856.209" dur="4.82">declined actually when the Elector said</text>
  <text start="859.029" dur="6">yes we would like to an Intel briefing</text>
  <text start="861.029" dur="7.42">the CIA never followed through so right</text>
  <text start="865.029" dur="5.071">now there is no evidence whatsoever</text>
  <text start="868.449" dur="5.07">because believe me if they had it they</text>
  <text start="870.1" dur="5.429">would have given it over and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="873.519" dur="4.351">to take this one step further how do we</text>
  <text start="875.529" dur="5.55">know there&amp;#39;s no evidence well there&amp;#39;s a</text>
