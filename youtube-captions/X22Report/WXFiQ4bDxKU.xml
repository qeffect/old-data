  <text start="150.629" dur="9.121">paper with ink on it from 400 years ago</text>
  <text start="154.909" dur="9.94">or a gold coin think about that for a</text>
  <text start="159.75" dur="9.12">second now I know everyone has forgotten</text>
  <text start="164.849" dur="7.381">about Cyprus and but I like to bring it</text>
  <text start="168.87" dur="7.92">up every now and then Cyprus capital</text>
  <text start="172.23" dur="8.22">controls are hurting the economy says</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="8.49">the commerce minister so basically the</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="8.099">capital controls since March are still</text>
  <text start="185.28" dur="5.73">in effect and they&amp;#39;re saying since</text>
  <text start="188.549" dur="7.02">people cannot take out money spend money</text>
  <text start="191.01" dur="8.94">it is having a huge effect on the</text>
  <text start="195.569" dur="8.461">economy of Cyprus so what this tells us</text>
  <text start="199.95" dur="7.71">is they can&amp;#39;t release the capital</text>
  <text start="204.03" dur="7.889">controls because every single person in</text>
  <text start="207.66" dur="6.72">Cyprus would do a bank run on the system</text>
  <text start="211.919" dur="5.79">so they need to keep these capital</text>
  <text start="214.38" dur="4.859">controls in effect and they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="3.351">if it hurts the economy if it hurts the</text>
  <text start="219.239" dur="4.47">economy guess what they have to do</text>
  <text start="221.06" dur="10.45">Cyprus will need to either sell their</text>
  <text start="223.709" dur="9.81">gold or borrow more money and this is</text>
  <text start="231.51" dur="4.8">this is basically what it is and</text>
  <text start="233.519" dur="6.06">basically this article goes on to say</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="6.39">total deposits in Cyprus banking system</text>
  <text start="239.579" dur="9.391">dropped nine point nine percent in April</text>
  <text start="242.7" dur="9.96">to 5050 7.4 billion euros from 63.7 bill</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="6.21">and billion euros in March reflecting</text>
  <text start="252.66" dur="5.639">the bail-in of bank of cyprus depositors</text>
  <text start="255.18" dur="6.959">with savings of more than 100,000 euros</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="7.74">the central bank of cyprus said of those</text>
  <text start="262.139" dur="7.02">accounts 37.5 percent were converted</text>
  <text start="266.039" dur="5.37">into equity while a further twenty two</text>
  <text start="269.159" dur="5.331">point five percent are temporarily</text>
  <text start="271.409" dur="5.51">blocked to ensure Bank of Cyprus</text>
  <text start="274.49" dur="5.6">meets the terms of its recapitalisation</text>
  <text start="276.919" dur="8.701">so basically what we can see here is</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="7.5">capital controls and keeping the the</text>
  <text start="285.62" dur="6.269">people from getting their money is</text>
  <text start="287.59" dur="6.21">absolutely not working and how do we</text>
  <text start="291.889" dur="5.791">know it&amp;#39;s not working because the</text>
  <text start="293.8" dur="7.39">president of Cyprus asked the central</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="6.51">banks and the European nations to remove</text>
  <text start="301.19" dur="5.4">the capital controls and that has not</text>
  <text start="304.19" dur="6.14">been done and that they are still in</text>
  <text start="306.59" dur="7.22">effect and we will continually see</text>
  <text start="310.33" dur="7.989">Cyprus be hurt by these capital controls</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="7.09">okay let&amp;#39;s move on here experts the Fed</text>
  <text start="318.319" dur="6.66">is creating a number of significant and</text>
  <text start="320.9" dur="7.53">dangerous leverage driven speculative</text>
  <text start="324.979" dur="5.91">bubbles between now and 2014 and we know</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="6.209">this for a fact basically what is</text>
  <text start="330.889" dur="9.06">happening is the Fed is creating a stock</text>
  <text start="334.639" dur="8.551">a Treasury bond bubble and a real estate</text>
  <text start="339.949" dur="5.631">bubble at this point and these bubbles</text>
  <text start="343.19" dur="5.969">are growing and growing and growing and</text>
  <text start="345.58" dur="6.639">we know the Fed is responsible for this</text>
  <text start="349.159" dur="9.63">even though they tell us they are not</text>
  <text start="352.219" dur="9.271">back in before 2008 when asked are you</text>
  <text start="358.789" dur="5.511">creating a real estate bubble they said</text>
  <text start="361.49" dur="5.31">no there is no real estate bubble and</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="4.899">basically there was a real estate bubble</text>
  <text start="366.8" dur="5.16">so I&amp;#39;ve said this in the past whenever</text>
  <text start="369.199" dur="4.981">government officials the Fed central</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="5.1">bankers whenever they say something</text>
  <text start="374.18" dur="6">always think the opposite because they</text>
  <text start="377.06" dur="6.9">never tell you the truth they never want</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="5.88">you to figure out what is going on even</text>
  <text start="383.96" dur="4.889">the mainstream media is on their side</text>
  <text start="386.06" dur="4.62">and they will continually tell you</text>
  <text start="388.849" dur="4.91">something and when they tell you</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="5.94">something it is always the opposite and</text>
  <text start="393.759" dur="5.47">when they&amp;#39;re telling you to buy get into</text>
  <text start="396.62" dur="4.949">the stock market actually do the</text>
  <text start="399.229" dur="4.591">opposite do not get into the stock</text>
  <text start="401.569" dur="5.491">market because this what and put it this</text>
  <text start="403.82" dur="4.029">way Ben Bernanke a couple weeks ago was</text>
  <text start="407.06" dur="4.259">daring</text>
  <text start="407.849" dur="7.35">people to get into the stock market and</text>
  <text start="411.319" dur="6.39">he basically said I dare you and when</text>
  <text start="415.199" dur="5.73">someone tells you I dare you especially</text>
  <text start="417.709" dur="5.71">the person who is supposed to be you</text>
  <text start="420.929" dur="4.44">know the head of the economy the person</text>
  <text start="423.419" dur="3.81">who&amp;#39;s supposed to be understanding of</text>
  <text start="425.369" dur="3.81">what&amp;#39;s going on making it better for the</text>
  <text start="427.229" dur="4.56">people for him to come out and say I</text>
  <text start="429.179" dur="6.39">dare you that should tell you right</text>
  <text start="431.789" dur="8.22">there and then not to get into the stock</text>
  <text start="435.569" dur="8.55">market because in 2006-2007 when asked</text>
  <text start="440.009" dur="6.12">about the subprime and asked about are</text>
  <text start="444.119" dur="5.16">we going into recession basically in</text>
  <text start="446.129" dur="6.18">2008 that was asked he says the Fed</text>
  <text start="449.279" dur="5.07">doesn&amp;#39;t foresee any type of recession in</text>
  <text start="452.309" dur="3.75">the new in the in the not-too-distant</text>
  <text start="454.349" dur="5.46">future and guess what happened in</text>
  <text start="456.059" dur="6.39">October into 2009 a recession so he has</text>
  <text start="459.809" dur="5.22">no idea what he is talking about</text>
  <text start="462.449" dur="5.01">actually let me rephrase this he does</text>
  <text start="465.029" dur="6.06">have an idea he&amp;#39;s just not letting you</text>
  <text start="467.459" dur="8.04">know what is going on the people of the</text>
  <text start="471.089" dur="10.401">world because their agenda is to steal</text>
  <text start="475.499" dur="5.991">the wealth from the people by doing this</text>
  <text start="483.289" dur="6.54">now I know burn a key came out and you</text>

  <text start="500.939" dur="5.49">print print print print give this money</text>
  <text start="503.969" dur="4.891">to the banks let the bank&amp;#39;s the</text>

  <text start="508.86" dur="6.14">into the stock market and keep this baby</text>
  <text start="511.379" dur="7.981">pumped up if they start to taper oh wait</text>
  <text start="515" dur="8.709">just a mention of taper what happened to</text>
  <text start="519.36" dur="8.31">the markets the markets now are down by</text>
  <text start="523.709" dur="9.771">200 points or so now is it going to stay</text>
  <text start="527.67" dur="10.169">like that no I mean when the market is</text>
  <text start="533.48" dur="8">teetering on a disaster here gold was</text>
  <text start="537.839" dur="9.391">pushed down $31 or so</text>
  <text start="541.48" dur="10.729">the Dow 200 or so plus points and the SP</text>
  <text start="547.23" dur="13.53">23 points just for mentioning that the</text>
  <text start="552.209" dur="11.111">Fed might taper the money printing and</text>
  <text start="560.76" dur="6.519">basically Bernanke and this article goes</text>
  <text start="563.32" dur="7.8">on to say on what that has to do with</text>
  <text start="567.279" dur="7.321">interest rates we were a little puzzled</text>
  <text start="571.12" dur="6.54">by that and the article goes on to say</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="5.849">almost exactly 8 years after Greenspan</text>
  <text start="577.66" dur="5.09">now infamous conundrum comments about</text>
  <text start="580.449" dur="5.431">the unprecedented persistence of low</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="5.889">long-term interest rates Bernanke is now</text>
  <text start="585.88" dur="6.92">puzzled at the dramatic rise in interest</text>
  <text start="588.639" dur="7.471">rates following his recent taper remarks</text>
  <text start="592.8" dur="6.07">have no fear though just as Greenspan</text>
  <text start="596.11" dur="4.5">noted I am reasonably certain we would</text>
  <text start="598.87" dur="5.219">not automatically assume that it would</text>
  <text start="600.61" dur="5.88">mean what it meant in the past Bernanke</text>
  <text start="604.089" dur="5.851">said today that the sharp rise in rates</text>
  <text start="606.49" dur="6.06">was not about the taper but due to other</text>
  <text start="609.94" dur="6.6">factors including optimism about the</text>
  <text start="612.55" dur="7.469">economy let&amp;#39;s say that&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="616.54" dur="6.33"> the rise in interest rates and</text>
  <text start="620.019" dur="6.951">everything that&amp;#39;s going on has nothing</text>
  <text start="622.87" dur="9.81">to do with the optimism of the economy</text>
  <text start="626.97" dur="7.72">getting better and he goes on about you</text>
  <text start="632.68" dur="4.409">know it&amp;#39;s difficult to judge whether the</text>
  <text start="634.69" dur="4.74">markets are in sync or not generally</text>
  <text start="637.089" dur="3.961">speaking though I think what I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="639.43" dur="4.38">from the analysts and markapur</text>
  <text start="641.05" dur="4.83">participants is is not widely different</text>
  <text start="643.81" dur="4.41">from what you know the committee is</text>
  <text start="645.88" dur="4.47">thinking and trying as I tried today to</text>
  <text start="648.22" dur="4.349">communicate I think the most important</text>
  <text start="650.35" dur="4.14">thing I just want to convey again is</text>
  <text start="652.569" dur="4.441">that it&amp;#39;s important not to say the state</text>
  <text start="654.49" dur="5.12">that day this time of course this is</text>
  <text start="657.01" dur="7.009">what he&amp;#39;s saying it&amp;#39;s called political</text>
  <text start="659.61" dur="9.339">financial babble what is happening is</text>
  <text start="664.019" dur="10.701">interest rates are rising inflation is</text>
  <text start="668.949" dur="10.361">going up money printing doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="674.72" dur="8.01">back in the Great Depression they</text>
  <text start="679.31" dur="8.37">contracted the money supply so burn a</text>
  <text start="682.73" dur="7.5">key being a a student of the Great</text>
  <text start="687.68" dur="5.04">Depression said we are going to do the</text>
  <text start="690.23" dur="5.039">opposite instead of contract the money</text>
  <text start="692.72" dur="5.25">supply we&amp;#39;re going to increase the money</text>
  <text start="695.269" dur="5.37">supply but the difference was he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="697.97" dur="6.239">give it to the people he kept it within</text>
  <text start="700.639" dur="5.971">the banks he kept it within the banks</text>
  <text start="704.209" dur="6.961">and said not to loan it to the people to</text>
  <text start="706.61" dur="9.419">put it back into the equity markets so</text>
  <text start="711.17" dur="8.07">now the entire thing the entire illusion</text>
  <text start="716.029" dur="5.221">is starting to fall apart and the Fed</text>
  <text start="719.24" dur="5.19">doesn&amp;#39;t know what to do they&amp;#39;re puzzled</text>
  <text start="721.25" dur="5.81">by this because you know it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="724.43" dur="6.959">falling apart and they give you</text>
  <text start="727.06" dur="6.55">financial babble where people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="731.389" dur="5.161">understand what is really going on and</text>
  <text start="733.61" dur="5.699">what he&amp;#39;s really saying is listen this</text>
  <text start="736.55" dur="6.92">is what it comes down to if we keep</text>
  <text start="739.309" dur="8.851">pumping up the markets our end result is</text>
  <text start="743.47" dur="8.469">an economic collapse if we if we remove</text>
  <text start="748.16" dur="6.69">the money printing and we stop feeding</text>
  <text start="751.939" dur="5.7">the banks and the banks stop purchasing</text>
  <text start="754.85" dur="5.64">all these stocks we&amp;#39;re going to have an</text>
  <text start="757.639" dur="5.55">economic collapse so which way would you</text>
  <text start="760.49" dur="5.699">rather have it would you like me to</text>
  <text start="763.189" dur="5.07">continue money printing until we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="766.189" dur="4.471">do it anymore you see inflation get out</text>
  <text start="768.259" dur="4.62">of control or do you want me to just</text>
  <text start="770.66" dur="6.359">stop right now and just have a collapse</text>
  <text start="772.879" dur="7.02">right now at this point and this is</text>
  <text start="777.019" dur="4.891">basically what is going on and it</text>

  <text start="1152.51" dur="6.69">about what they&amp;#39;re doing now there was</text>
  <text start="1157.22" dur="5.13">an article that i found that said</text>

  <text start="1173.48" dur="8.73">making that hit list of targets and</text>
  <text start="1177.309" dur="8.831">general Alexander from the NSA has said</text>

  <text start="1191.47" dur="5.47">basically this has come out to say that</text>
  <text start="1194.63" dur="4.25">and I&amp;#39;ll read this to you the director</text>
  <text start="1196.94" dur="4.619">provides that any cyber operations</text>

  <text start="1218.309" dur="5.911">operations without presidential approval</text>
  <text start="1221.46" dur="6.51">and it also goes on to say that the</text>
  <text start="1224.22" dur="7.62">president and the US government can</text>
  <text start="1227.97" dur="8.699">create and do cyber attacks within the</text>
  <text start="1231.84" dur="10.44">United States and this is very strange</text>
  <text start="1236.669" dur="9.26">to me and I like what I&amp;#39;ve said to what</text>
  <text start="1242.28" dur="7.1">I&amp;#39;ve said before is that cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="1245.929" dur="9.011">are the main event for the US government</text>

  <text start="1254.94" dur="9">bills sista past which is also pending</text>
  <text start="1257.79" dur="8.16">in the Senate and the get us into war</text>
  <text start="1263.94" dur="6.35">with some type of false flag because I</text>

  <text start="1270.29" dur="7.84">propaganda has completely failed and no</text>
  <text start="1275.37" dur="6.75">one is buying it here in America the</text>

  <text start="1282.12" dur="8.73">people of America do not want to go to</text>
  <text start="1286.049" dur="8.281">war and the only way to push this agenda</text>
  <text start="1290.85" dur="6.69">just like the gun bill is to have a</text>
  <text start="1294.33" dur="6.839">false flag and to push the people into</text>
  <text start="1297.54" dur="6.09">going into war and we are going to see</text>
  <text start="1301.169" dur="11.671">something like this and for the</text>
  <text start="1303.63" dur="12.81">president to create and to basically say</text>
  <text start="1312.84" dur="6.48">that there is an emergency and implement</text>
  <text start="1316.44" dur="6.63">a cyber attack within the United States</text>
  <text start="1319.32" dur="7.229">he can do this easily with the executive</text>
  <text start="1323.07" dur="7.55">order of preparedness where he does not</text>
  <text start="1326.549" dur="6.811">need Congress or the people of the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1330.62" dur="5.38">to say there&amp;#39;s an emergency he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1333.36" dur="5.939">need their approval he can just declare</text>
  <text start="1336" dur="5.85">it and this falls directly into that</text>
  <text start="1339.299" dur="5.521">where he could cyber attack and</text>
  <text start="1341.85" dur="6.54">anything within the United States and I</text>
  <text start="1344.82" dur="5.76">mean what would you cyber attack let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1348.39" dur="4.71">say militias are forming and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1350.58" dur="5.28">communicating over the internet he can</text>
  <text start="1353.1" dur="6.03">cyber attack you know the internet and</text>

  <text start="1359.13" dur="6.44">don&amp;#39;t know why this is in here but I</text>
  <text start="1362.309" dur="9.031">thought it was very interesting that</text>
  <text start="1365.57" dur="9.64">this was part of the emergency cyber</text>
  <text start="1371.34" dur="9.66">action and it all needs is the approval</text>
  <text start="1375.21" dur="8.67">of the president now moving on there is</text>
  <text start="1381" dur="5.669">a toy gun march in washington DC</text>
  <text start="1383.88" dur="5.039">scheduled for july third which is very</text>
  <text start="1386.669" dur="6.901">interesting also because it corresponds</text>
  <text start="1388.919" dur="7.441">to the july 4th march on the capital&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1393.57" dur="5.729">by gun owners with or without loaded</text>

  <text start="1416.909" dur="6.661">Bridge and ending at the national mall</text>
  <text start="1419.37" dur="6.299">now this seems very interesting because</text>
  <text start="1423.57" dur="5.07">this was kind of the more that kokesh</text>
  <text start="1425.669" dur="6.571">wanted to do on july 4th and this is</text>
  <text start="1428.64" dur="6.39">with toy weapons and basically this what</text>
  <text start="1432.24" dur="6.54">this article goes on to say is the</text>
  <text start="1435.03" dur="6.3">follow the event aims to be a peaceful</text>
  <text start="1438.78" dur="5.43">protest of citizens armed with toy water</text>

  <text start="1449.1" dur="4.439">planned for the fourth of july and DC</text>
  <text start="1451.32" dur="3.839">the plans for that event were met with</text>
  <text start="1453.539" dur="3.51">much resistance from local law</text>
  <text start="1455.159" dur="4.681">enforcement vowed to take action against</text>
  <text start="1457.049" dur="4.62">protesters resulting in organizer adam</text>
  <text start="1459.84" dur="4.35">kokesh eventually cancelling the protest</text>
  <text start="1461.669" dur="6.481">however brought about the creation of</text>
  <text start="1464.19" dur="7.35">the toy gun march this to me seems like</text>
  <text start="1468.15" dur="6.95">this is going to be some type of setup</text>
  <text start="1471.54" dur="6.259">somehow somehow someway somehow</text>
  <text start="1475.1" dur="5.22">especially with people mark in marching</text>
  <text start="1477.799" dur="5.101">on the Capitals this is being marched on</text>
  <text start="1480.32" dur="6.54">July third and it just seems like</text>
  <text start="1482.9" dur="6.24">something is going to happen and the vh</text>
  <text start="1486.86" dur="4.65">insider who reported that something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1489.14" dur="4.529">going to happen on july 4th 5th 6th 7th</text>
  <text start="1491.51" dur="4.23">didn&amp;#39;t know the exact date but around</text>
  <text start="1493.669" dur="7.081">that period so what do we have happening</text>
  <text start="1495.74" dur="7.319">here Kokesh is March with real guns has</text>
  <text start="1500.75" dur="7.77">been replaced with the same exact March</text>
  <text start="1503.059" dur="7.441">with toy guns now we the FBI CIA or any</text>
  <text start="1508.52" dur="4.649">other type of agency can infiltrate this</text>
  <text start="1510.5" dur="5.46">group and they can say that someone</text>
  <text start="1513.169" dur="6.211">actually has a real gun that person with</text>
  <text start="1515.96" dur="6.51">the real gun can fire on people and then</text>
  <text start="1519.38" dur="5.31">the armed forces on the military can</text>
  <text start="1522.47" dur="4.8">step in put boots on the ground the</text>
  <text start="1524.69" dur="5.67">police force can put you know and DHS</text>
  <text start="1527.27" dur="7.17">can arrive and this thing can turn into</text>
  <text start="1530.36" dur="6.78">a huge huge huge mess which turns out to</text>
  <text start="1534.44" dur="5.729">be a false flag which which then could</text>
  <text start="1537.14" dur="5.19">move into martial law saying gun people</text>
  <text start="1540.169" dur="4.38">are crazy they were supposed to march</text>
  <text start="1542.33" dur="5.88">with toy guns but they actually have</text>

  <text start="1548.21" dur="8.15">now marching on the Capitals at the same</text>
  <text start="1552.38" dur="7.409">time the next day and this whole thing</text>
  <text start="1556.36" dur="9.91">complete can completely fall apart and</text>
  <text start="1559.789" dur="9.091">could work to get those gun laws that</text>
  <text start="1566.27" dur="5.159">are pending in the senate-passed martial</text>

  <text start="1574.789" dur="5.071">just seems that something is not right</text>
  <text start="1577.64" dur="5.58">and it feels like it&amp;#39;s a huge set up</text>
  <text start="1579.86" dur="6.27">just like the quantum cyberattack drill</text>
  <text start="1583.22" dur="5.579">which is also scheduled right before</text>
  <text start="1586.13" dur="4.32">july 4th which is June twenty-eighth</text>
  <text start="1588.799" dur="4.651">which is a friday which i already</text>
  <text start="1590.45" dur="8.43">discussed and this whole thing seems</text>
  <text start="1593.45" dur="11.94">like it is a complete set up and i would</text>
  <text start="1598.88" dur="9.36">be actually shocked if nothing happens</text>
