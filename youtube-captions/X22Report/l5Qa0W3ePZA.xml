  <text start="90.09" dur="4.139">central bank economy we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="91.59" dur="5.849">imploding we know the real information</text>
  <text start="94.229" dur="6.93">is showing that the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="97.439" dur="6.42">is not going to last unless the central</text>
  <text start="101.159" dur="3.96">bank does something to kick the can down</text>
  <text start="103.859" dur="4.311">the street like they&amp;#39;ve done in the past</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="7.53">and one of those things is to either</text>
  <text start="108.17" dur="7.72">drop the rates or create stimulus or do</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="5.22">both and Trump has been tweeting out</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="6.179">that he would like the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="7.621">to cut the rates he would like the</text>
  <text start="122.069" dur="6.69">Federal Reserve to have the stimulus</text>
  <text start="125.49" dur="5.37">again because this would help the</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="2.701">economy move along now we need to</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="3.9">remember</text>
  <text start="131.46" dur="6.12">Trump needs to have the economy doing</text>
  <text start="134.76" dur="5.55">well for the 2020 election he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="137.58" dur="5.129">be using the economy to win the election</text>
  <text start="140.31" dur="4.05">this is the entire plan even though the</text>
  <text start="142.709" dur="4.471">central bank&amp;#39;s system the entire</text>
  <text start="144.36" dur="4.56">economic system that they set up it is</text>
  <text start="147.18" dur="4.889">imploding on itself he knows this he</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="5.43">understands what is happening and the</text>
  <text start="152.069" dur="5.371">reason why he&amp;#39;s pushing the central bank</text>
  <text start="154.35" dur="6.48">because he wants all eyes on the central</text>
  <text start="157.44" dur="6.6">bank and the central bank well it looks</text>
  <text start="160.83" dur="5.579">like Trump might have maneuvered away</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="5.64">to get the central bank out there to say</text>
  <text start="166.409" dur="5.851">you know something we might have to cut</text>
  <text start="169.68" dur="4.529">rates and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="5.309">projecting out there to get ahead of</text>
  <text start="174.209" dur="6.45">what is coming but first let&amp;#39;s go to the</text>
  <text start="177.569" dur="6.06">UK because Nigel Farraj sent something</text>
  <text start="180.659" dur="5.761">very very interesting he said we have a</text>
  <text start="183.629" dur="6.72">genuine democratic crisis in this</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="8.039">country and the reason simple we voted</text>
  <text start="190.349" dur="5.06">to leave by quite a big majority in a</text>
  <text start="194.459" dur="3.9">referendum</text>
  <text start="195.409" dur="4.871">we then voted a year later in a general</text>
  <text start="198.359" dur="4.321">election for two political parties who</text>
  <text start="200.28" dur="7.53">told us they would respect our wishes</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="7.679">and carry out brexit we then saw 500 MPs</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="5.67">vote for article 50 which said we leave</text>
  <text start="210.359" dur="7.231">on March 29th with or without a</text>
  <text start="213.48" dur="5.819">withdrawal agreement the reason we</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="3.929">didn&amp;#39;t leave on March 29th is these</text>
  <text start="219.299" dur="3.951">people don&amp;#39;t want us to become an</text>
  <text start="221.519" dur="4.44">independent self-governing nation</text>
  <text start="223.25" dur="5.769">they&amp;#39;re doing their utmost to thwart</text>
  <text start="225.959" dur="4.71">brexit he tweeted out the following we</text>
  <text start="229.019" dur="3.601">have a genuine democratic crisis in this</text>
  <text start="230.669" dur="6.99">country this is a coalition of</text>
  <text start="232.62" dur="6.839">politicians against the people yes this</text>
  <text start="237.659" dur="4.431">is exactly what it is we&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="239.459" dur="6.93">this for a very long time the</text>
  <text start="242.09" dur="9.209">establishment the elite they do not want</text>
  <text start="246.389" dur="8.34">anyone leaving their system if the UK</text>
  <text start="251.299" dur="7.391">breaks apart from the EU and the UK</text>
  <text start="254.729" dur="6.781">thrives this is going to be a disaster</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="4.44">for the EU they know this same thing</text>
  <text start="261.51" dur="4.409">with the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="6.06">systems around the world if any country</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="6.93">leaves the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="5.94">system and it thrives which it would</text>
  <text start="272.849" dur="4.021">because they would create currency</text>
  <text start="275.13" dur="4.5">without loaning it to themselves</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="5.299">there&amp;#39;d be no interest attached which</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="5.4">means you wouldn&amp;#39;t have a huge debt load</text>
  <text start="282.169" dur="4.271">which means things would be a lot better</text>
  <text start="285.03" dur="3.29">you wouldn&amp;#39;t have corruption you would</text>
  <text start="286.44" dur="6.42">be able to erase a lot of these things</text>
  <text start="288.32" dur="6.37">and if those countries use gold as a</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="4.68">confidence builder or to back their</text>
  <text start="294.69" dur="5.49">currency well that would be incredible</text>
  <text start="297.54" dur="5.82">and what would that do that would</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="6.15">destroy the central bank system this is</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="4.86">what they&amp;#39;re most afraid of and this is</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="3.69">why they&amp;#39;re always going to try to stop</text>
  <text start="308.22" dur="3.99">it and remember these people in</text>
  <text start="310.02" dur="5.01">government most of them are corrupt most</text>
  <text start="312.21" dur="4.74">of them are corrupt by the central bank</text>
  <text start="315.03" dur="4.8">how do you think these people got</text>
  <text start="316.95" dur="4.65">wealthy you think all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="319.83" dur="4.14">got into government and on their</text>
  <text start="321.6" dur="5.88">government salary all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="323.97" dur="6.87">were able to pick the best investments</text>
  <text start="327.48" dur="5.94">ever they were able to make deals just</text>
  <text start="330.84" dur="5.64">out of the blue to increase their wealth</text>
  <text start="333.42" dur="7.32">now it&amp;#39;s called corruption they have the</text>
  <text start="336.48" dur="6.87">inside track and this is about to end</text>
  <text start="340.74" dur="5.1">now very interesting Lee as we know</text>
  <text start="343.35" dur="4.23">Trump needs to continually push that the</text>
  <text start="345.84" dur="3.6">economy is great and he&amp;#39;s manipulating</text>
  <text start="347.58" dur="3.21">the numbers he&amp;#39;s using all the tools</text>
  <text start="349.44" dur="3.99">that the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="350.79" dur="4.56">used against We the People he&amp;#39;s using it</text>
  <text start="353.43" dur="5.19">against them and they&amp;#39;re finding it very</text>
  <text start="355.35" dur="6.24">difficult to fight him he tweeted out</text>
  <text start="358.62" dur="5.9">today the average 401k balance has</text>
  <text start="361.59" dur="6.9">soared since the bottom of the market</text>
  <text start="364.52" dur="6.64">466 percent Wow and he&amp;#39;s letting all</text>
  <text start="368.49" dur="5.82">those people who have 401ks retirement</text>
  <text start="371.16" dur="5.78">plans look how well you are doing now</text>
  <text start="374.31" dur="6.18">don&amp;#39;t you feel good yes it is on paper</text>
  <text start="376.94" dur="6.25">but don&amp;#39;t you feel good that the economy</text>
  <text start="380.49" dur="3.27">is doing this well now he&amp;#39;s doing this</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="4.46">on purpose</text>
  <text start="383.76" dur="8.63">it&amp;#39;s part of the plan and then we have</text>
  <text start="387.65" dur="7.63">the China trade deal and the tariffs and</text>
  <text start="392.39" dur="4.72">we know that the Chinese are here in the</text>
  <text start="395.28" dur="4.59">United States they are working with</text>
  <text start="397.11" dur="4.95">Trump and Trump really doesn&amp;#39;t care at</text>
  <text start="399.87" dur="3.87">this point if they make a deal today or</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="3.39">if they make a deal in a couple of</text>
  <text start="403.74" dur="4.86">months it makes no difference whatsoever</text>
  <text start="405.45" dur="5.67">and he tweeted out many different tweets</text>
  <text start="408.6" dur="4.89">but let&amp;#39;s start with the first one talks</text>
  <text start="411.12" dur="4.41">with China continued in a very congenial</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="4.71">manner there is absolutely no need to</text>
  <text start="415.53" dur="5.22">rush as tariffs are now being paid to</text>
  <text start="418.2" dur="4.32">the United States by China of 25 percent</text>
  <text start="420.75" dur="3.6">on two hundred and fifty billion dollars</text>
  <text start="422.52" dur="3.48">worth of goods and products these</text>
  <text start="424.35" dur="4.62">massive payments go directly to the</text>
  <text start="426" dur="5.59">Treasury of the US the process has begun</text>
  <text start="428.97" dur="4.87">to place additional tariffs at 25</text>
  <text start="431.59" dur="4.59">sent on the remaining 325 billion</text>
  <text start="433.84" dur="4.05">dollars the US only sells China</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="4.35">approximately 100 billion dollars of</text>
  <text start="437.89" dur="4.89">goods and products a very big imbalance</text>
  <text start="440.53" dur="4.73">with the over 100 billion dollars in</text>
  <text start="442.78" dur="4.59">tariffs that we take in we will buy</text>
  <text start="445.26" dur="4.9">agricultural products from our great</text>
  <text start="447.37" dur="5.04">farmers in large amounts than China ever</text>
  <text start="450.16" dur="4.35">did and ship it to poor and starving</text>
  <text start="452.41" dur="4.53">countries in the form of humanitarian</text>
  <text start="454.51" dur="4.53">assistance in the meantime we will</text>
  <text start="456.94" dur="4.89">continue to negotiate with China in the</text>
  <text start="459.04" dur="7.5">hopes that they do not again try to redo</text>
  <text start="461.83" dur="6.87">the deal if we bought 15 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="466.54" dur="4.08">of agricultural from our farmers far</text>
  <text start="468.7" dur="4.65">more than China buys now we would have</text>
  <text start="470.62" dur="5.1">more than 85 billion dollars left over</text>
  <text start="473.35" dur="4.77">for a new infrastructure health care or</text>
  <text start="475.72" dur="4.62">anything else China would greatly slow</text>
  <text start="478.12" dur="5.52">down and we would automatically speed up</text>
  <text start="480.34" dur="5.22">we have been engaged in an unfair</text>
  <text start="483.64" dur="3.81">relationship with China for a very long</text>
  <text start="485.56" dur="4.56">time they have reneged on the</text>
  <text start="487.45" dur="4.77">commitments they made to the WTO the</text>
  <text start="490.12" dur="4.56">World Trade Organization particularly</text>
  <text start="492.22" dur="3.81">around intellectual property and Trump</text>
  <text start="494.68" dur="3.42">finished up with the following tweet</text>
  <text start="496.03" dur="5.55">build your products in the United States</text>
  <text start="498.1" dur="5.13">and there are no tariffs now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.58" dur="2.91">reverse a little bit remember when the</text>
  <text start="503.23" dur="2.97">mainstream media was out there and many</text>
  <text start="504.49" dur="3.45">politicians were out there even the</text>
  <text start="506.2" dur="4.95">central bank they were saying well if</text>
  <text start="507.94" dur="6.09">Trump puts these tariffs on China the</text>
  <text start="511.15" dur="5.19">10% we&amp;#39;re going to see an increase on</text>
  <text start="514.03" dur="5.73">consumer products and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="516.34" dur="6.5">devastating well did we see this no why</text>
  <text start="519.76" dur="6.12">because when you place tariffs on China</text>
  <text start="522.84" dur="5.8">the middleman who buys the product from</text>
  <text start="525.88" dur="4.62">China may be that product is 20 cents</text>
  <text start="528.64" dur="5.28">that means with 10% what is like 2 cents</text>
  <text start="530.5" dur="5.7">or something that middleman right there</text>
  <text start="533.92" dur="4.41">and then pays the tax and then another</text>
  <text start="536.2" dur="3.3">middleman comes in and purchases the</text>
  <text start="538.33" dur="3.27">goods from that middleman and an</text>
  <text start="539.5" dur="4.77">aluminum man comes in purchase the goods</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="4.95">and before you know it that 2 cents is</text>
  <text start="544.27" dur="5.73">completely gone so if even if you take</text>
  <text start="546.55" dur="6.84">the 25% on that it&amp;#39;s going to wash out</text>
  <text start="550" dur="6.15">it will it will barely be recognizable</text>
  <text start="553.39" dur="4.77">when it hits the United States but the</text>
  <text start="556.15" dur="4.59">mainstream media and the financial pun</text>
  <text start="558.16" dur="4.89">ins and the politicians that try to make</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="4.8">it seem like we&amp;#39;re going to see our TVs</text>
  <text start="563.05" dur="5.13">go from $800 to</text>
  <text start="565.54" dur="5.13">thousand dollars it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="568.18" dur="4.31">happen but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="5.82">that the central bank is out there and</text>
  <text start="572.49" dur="8.289">they&amp;#39;re already talking about rate cuts</text>
  <text start="576.49" dur="7.23">now look what they did to explain why</text>
  <text start="580.779" dur="4.29">they might have to use rate cuts now now</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="3.09">this is coming out of the Atlanta Fed</text>
  <text start="585.069" dur="4.291">now remember within the Central Bank</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="7.17">there are good guys and bad guys so in</text>
  <text start="589.36" dur="6.69">the Atlanta Fed Raphael Bostic said the</text>
  <text start="593.98" dur="5.159">central bank might have to cut interest</text>
  <text start="596.05" dur="5.58">rates if consumer spending suffers as a</text>
  <text start="599.139" dur="6.721">result of the new round of terrorists</text>
  <text start="601.63" dur="7.319">placed on Chinese goods overnight hmm</text>
  <text start="605.86" dur="5.399">that&amp;#39;s very interesting and they went on</text>
  <text start="608.949" dur="5.76">to say that well consumers really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="611.259" dur="6.27">feel much pain from the earlier tariffs</text>
  <text start="614.709" dur="5.791">but this time around it might be a lot</text>
  <text start="617.529" dur="5.011">worse well no it really isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="620.5" dur="5.1">but what the Fed is doing right now</text>
  <text start="622.54" dur="5.489">they&amp;#39;re projecting and getting ahead of</text>
  <text start="625.6" dur="5.4">what is coming that there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="628.029" dur="5.61">rate cuts coming and they&amp;#39;re pushing it</text>
  <text start="631" dur="5.209">out to the American people and this is</text>
  <text start="633.639" dur="7.291">being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="636.209" dur="9.31">now remember Trump is going to start to</text>
  <text start="640.93" dur="8.339">tweet out that the central bank the Fed</text>
  <text start="645.519" dur="5.851">needs to cut rates now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="649.269" dur="3.361">blame this on the tariffs now these</text>
  <text start="651.37" dur="4.199">tariffs going to last</text>
  <text start="652.63" dur="4.439">most likely not eventually we will have</text>
  <text start="655.569" dur="4.681">a deal with China but even if they do</text>
  <text start="657.069" dur="7.32">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to use this and blame</text>
  <text start="660.25" dur="8.519">it on Trump and they know that once the</text>
  <text start="664.389" dur="6.151">trade talks are worked out they know the</text>
  <text start="668.769" dur="3.901">tariffs are eventually going to go away</text>
  <text start="670.54" dur="4.14">which would mean if they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="672.67" dur="4.08">this reasoning they would be able to</text>
  <text start="674.68" dur="5.61">raise rates but we know they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="676.75" dur="6.36">going to do this so right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="680.29" dur="5.76">trying to get ahead of what is coming</text>
  <text start="683.11" dur="5.459">and that is rate cuts and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="686.05" dur="5.279">building the narrative to let everyone</text>
  <text start="688.569" dur="5.991">know that yes they&amp;#39;re thinking about it</text>
  <text start="691.329" dur="7.661">right now they&amp;#39;re also thinking about</text>
  <text start="694.56" dur="7.01">stimulus now why is this all happening</text>
  <text start="698.99" dur="5.37">this is all happening because the</text>
  <text start="701.57" dur="7.5">Federal Reserve they were on track to</text>
  <text start="704.36" dur="6.87">bring the economy down in 2020 right</text>
  <text start="709.07" dur="4.95">before the election that was the plan we</text>
  <text start="711.23" dur="4.5">know this from q.q told us that they</text>
  <text start="714.02" dur="4.68">knew that this was the plan and if you</text>
  <text start="715.73" dur="5.04">notice cue said they had a plan to stop</text>
  <text start="718.7" dur="4.47">all this Trump started to tweet out</text>
  <text start="720.77" dur="3.81">listen you&amp;#39;re ruining the economy you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="723.17" dur="4.5">ruining the economy you&amp;#39;re ruining the</text>
  <text start="724.58" dur="4.85">economy I&amp;#39;m making it better you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="727.67" dur="5.1">ruining it every time you raise rates</text>
  <text start="729.43" dur="5.2">the Fed they decided we&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="732.77" dur="4.08">raise rates anymore because all the</text>
  <text start="734.63" dur="5.04">fingers were pointed at them they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="736.85" dur="5.49">want to be in the spotlight neither does</text>
  <text start="739.67" dur="4.2">the ECB neither does the IMF none of</text>
  <text start="742.34" dur="5.04">these central banks they hide in the</text>
  <text start="743.87" dur="6.03">shadows and what is happening here is</text>
  <text start="747.38" dur="4.92">Trump is going to keep the pressure on</text>
  <text start="749.9" dur="6.18">them he&amp;#39;s gonna continually point at</text>
  <text start="752.3" dur="5.73">them once the China trade deals are all</text>
  <text start="756.08" dur="3.9">worked out once all this is said and</text>
  <text start="758.03" dur="4.77">done he&amp;#39;s gonna start tweeting out now</text>
  <text start="759.98" dur="4.89">the Fed is already prepared to do</text>
  <text start="762.8" dur="5.73">stimulus because now they can&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="764.87" dur="5.43">economy come down in 2020 they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="768.53" dur="2.97">blamed for it and Trump is not gonna let</text>
  <text start="770.3" dur="4.53">this happen the Patriots are not gonna</text>
  <text start="771.5" dur="6.57">let this happen the Fed does not like to</text>
  <text start="774.83" dur="6">be exposed remember who controls all the</text>
  <text start="778.07" dur="4.92">central banks the Rothschilds they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="780.83" dur="5.22">want their system going away they want</text>
  <text start="782.99" dur="6.12">to keep it so the Fed is going to launch</text>
  <text start="786.05" dur="5.85">something called a rate peg instead of</text>
  <text start="789.11" dur="4.32">QE now again all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="791.9" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re changing names around and</text>
  <text start="793.43" dur="6.9">they&amp;#39;re just changing on how they push</text>
  <text start="796.64" dur="6.48">stimulus so when zero percent short-term</text>
  <text start="800.33" dur="5.88">interest rates are no longer enough to</text>
  <text start="803.12" dur="5.49">stimulate the economy the Fed might</text>
  <text start="806.21" dur="5.04">announce a target for a slightly longer</text>
  <text start="808.61" dur="5.88">dated interest rate such as a one-year</text>
  <text start="811.25" dur="5.49">rate and it would buy just enough</text>
  <text start="814.49" dur="4.5">securities with those maturities to</text>
  <text start="816.74" dur="4.41">bring the one-year yield down to the</text>
  <text start="818.99" dur="4.71">target range and if more stimulus is</text>
  <text start="821.15" dur="5.64">needed in my targer target two year</text>
  <text start="823.7" dur="4.89">rates now under this policy the Federal</text>
  <text start="826.79" dur="3.84">Reserve would stand ready to use its</text>
  <text start="828.59" dur="3.82">balance sheet to hit the targeted</text>
  <text start="830.63" dur="3.67">interest rates but unlike the</text>
  <text start="832.41" dur="3.75">asset purchases that were undertaking in</text>
  <text start="834.3" dur="3.57">the recent recession there would be no</text>
  <text start="836.16" dur="4.71">specific commitments with regard to</text>
  <text start="837.87" dur="5.79">purchases of Treasury securities they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="840.87" dur="6.12">already thinking of a way to keep the</text>
  <text start="843.66" dur="6.84">system going past the 2020 elections</text>
  <text start="846.99" dur="6.03">this is being done on purpose first we</text>
  <text start="850.5" dur="4.95">started out with China they injected a</text>
  <text start="853.02" dur="4.68">huge amount of dollars of stimulus into</text>
  <text start="855.45" dur="4.59">the economy that&amp;#39;s not gonna last that</text>
  <text start="857.7" dur="4.85">much longer the Federal Reserve well</text>
  <text start="860.04" dur="5.46">they were unwinding their balance sheet</text>
  <text start="862.55" dur="6.31">then they decided okay we&amp;#39;re gonna stop</text>
  <text start="865.5" dur="6">doing this come the fall and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="868.86" dur="5.52">keep interest rates steady now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="871.5" dur="6.36">talking about rate cuts and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="874.38" dur="7.65">talking about stimulus who&amp;#39;s in control</text>
  <text start="877.86" dur="7.29">the Patriots this is all part of the</text>
  <text start="882.03" dur="5.97">plan to keep this system going long</text>
  <text start="885.15" dur="5.31">enough so Trump can win the election he</text>
  <text start="888" dur="5.52">needs to win the election to finish the</text>
  <text start="890.46" dur="7.38">job what is the job the job is to drain</text>
  <text start="893.52" dur="5.91">the swamp yes before the elections we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="897.84" dur="3.66">going to see a rest yes before the</text>
  <text start="899.43" dur="5.67">elections we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of these</text>
  <text start="901.5" dur="8.94">people&amp;#39;s go to jail but we still have a</text>
  <text start="905.1" dur="7.56">problem and that is the central bank yes</text>
  <text start="910.44" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re getting rid of the outliers we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="912.66" dur="4.5">getting rid of all these people but if</text>
  <text start="914.49" dur="6.81">we don&amp;#39;t get rid of the source guess</text>
  <text start="917.16" dur="6.63">what new people take their place and it</text>
  <text start="921.3" dur="5.19">starts all over again it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="923.79" dur="6.63">never-ending cycle because the central</text>
  <text start="926.49" dur="6.9">bank will corrupt other people so the</text>
  <text start="930.42" dur="5.52">first stage of his presidency is to get</text>
  <text start="933.39" dur="4.44">these people out of the picture and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="935.94" dur="4.74">talking about you know Clinton and Comey</text>
  <text start="937.83" dur="5.31">and the rest the second phase is to win</text>
  <text start="940.68" dur="5.61">the election with all these people gone</text>
  <text start="943.14" dur="4.56">he can concentrate on the central bank</text>
  <text start="946.29" dur="5.01">now a lot of people don&amp;#39;t think this but</text>
  <text start="947.7" dur="5.01">the central bank is a tougher nut people</text>
