  <text start="74.31" dur="5.25">continually look at all the economic</text>
  <text start="76.259" dur="7.021">indicators we are realizing that the</text>
  <text start="79.56" dur="6.12">majority of them 99.999% of them they</text>
  <text start="83.28" dur="5.25">have been declining and if we go back to</text>
  <text start="85.68" dur="5.67">2008 we know we&amp;#39;ve lost up to this point</text>
  <text start="88.53" dur="8.179">about 1.5 1.6 million manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="8.329">and we see we gained about 1.4 1.5</text>
  <text start="96.709" dur="6.371">bartender waiter waitresses jobs and</text>
  <text start="99.679" dur="5.83">we&amp;#39;re starting to look at the restaurant</text>
  <text start="103.08" dur="5.25">Performance Index and we reported on</text>
  <text start="105.509" dur="6.211">this about a month or so ago and this</text>
  <text start="108.33" dur="6.39">has dropped even further and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="5.129">seeing right now is that this restaurant</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="6.06">index has dropped for the fourth</text>
  <text start="116.849" dur="6.991">consecutive month in a row and we</text>
  <text start="120.78" dur="6.33">haven&amp;#39;t seen anything like this since</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="5.75">the first financial crisis and this has</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="4.76">dropped about three percent in March and</text>
  <text start="129.59" dur="5.77">we can see when we look at the graph</text>
  <text start="131.87" dur="7.03">everything has been declining it is not</text>
  <text start="135.36" dur="6.239">improving which means restaurants are</text>
  <text start="138.9" dur="4.559">slowing those bartenders waiters and</text>
  <text start="141.599" dur="4.561">waitresses jobs they&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="143.459" dur="4.411">to slow also and most likely we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="146.16" dur="4.799">to see a lot of people out of work in</text>
  <text start="147.87" dur="5.04">that sector so we&amp;#39;re seeing retail where</text>
  <text start="150.959" dur="4.321">people are losing jobs we see corporate</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="3.96">where people losing jobs we see the</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="3.539">banking sector people are losing jobs</text>
  <text start="156.87" dur="3.63">and now we&amp;#39;re all those jobs were</text>
  <text start="158.819" dur="5.011">shifting into those part-time bartender</text>
  <text start="160.5" dur="5.01">waiter waitress jobs there</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="3.36">we&amp;#39;re going to see the same thing happen</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="4.68">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see it happen</text>
  <text start="167.19" dur="4.62">already and as we move along things are</text>
  <text start="170.19" dur="4.92">getting worse and worse and not better</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="8.52">and when we look at the restaurant index</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="7.77">it looks a lot like 2008 it was one of</text>
  <text start="180.33" dur="6.45">the lead indicators back then and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="182.88" dur="6.51">seeing the same thing occur exactly how</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="5.13">it happened in 2008 and each one of</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="4.89">these economic indicators has an effect</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="4.8">on another and it is like a domino</text>
  <text start="194.28" dur="5.01">effect and each one leads into the other</text>
  <text start="196.71" dur="5.4">and before you know it the whole system</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="4.919">comes tumbling down and of course the</text>
  <text start="202.11" dur="4.44">government the central bank will blame</text>
  <text start="204.209" dur="4.141">this on whoever they want to blame it on</text>
  <text start="206.55" dur="4.04">because they can never accept</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="7.14">responsibility for what happened here</text>
  <text start="210.59" dur="8.32">now Google they are displaying a new</text>
  <text start="215.49" dur="5.719">message to help everyone and what</text>
  <text start="218.91" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re displaying right now is a</text>
  <text start="221.209" dur="6.281">full-page warning if a state-backed</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="5.88">attacker attempts to access your Gmail</text>
  <text start="227.49" dur="5.4">or any other type of an account that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.28" dur="5.52">on Google and they put up a message and</text>
  <text start="232.89" dur="4.44">the message reads the government back</text>
  <text start="235.8" dur="3.18">attackers may be trying to steal your</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="3.659">password there&amp;#39;s a chance this is a</text>
  <text start="238.98" dur="3.81">false alarm but we believe that the</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="3.72">government back attackers may be trying</text>
  <text start="242.79" dur="5.37">to trick you to get your google account</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="5.431">passwords now I wonder if they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="248.16" dur="4.859">to use this when the United States</text>
  <text start="250.14" dur="5.969">government actually spies on the people</text>
  <text start="253.019" dur="8.371">most likely not most likely this message</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="9.241">will be focused on China on Russia North</text>
  <text start="261.39" dur="6.69">Korea Iran Syria if any of these nations</text>
  <text start="265.35" dur="3.84">are trying to do anything this is what</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="2.76">they&amp;#39;re going to report but if the</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="4.86">government the US government is spying</text>
  <text start="270.84" dur="6.84">on you guess what you will never see</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="7.08">this message whatsoever now we see that</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="5.4">in the wake of all this terrorism where</text>
  <text start="281.13" dur="3.81">they keep pushing that oh they must have</text>
  <text start="283.08" dur="3.87">been using encryption that&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="4.92">and we can see that most of these</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="4.62">terrorism acts it&amp;#39;s an inside job so we</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="4.01">know they&amp;#39;re not using the everyday</text>
  <text start="291.57" dur="5.33">iphone they&amp;#39;re not using the everyday</text>
  <text start="293.87" dur="5.1">social media type of networking</text>
  <text start="296.9" dur="5.31">where they use Facebook or Twitter or</text>
  <text start="298.97" dur="5.009">Instagram or snapchat or any of these</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="4.65">things because if there was really a</text>
  <text start="303.979" dur="4.981">criminal a real terrorists they would</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="3.779">create and use their own methods of</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="4.11">communication to carry out whatever</text>
  <text start="310.639" dur="4.141">they&amp;#39;re going to do but of course the</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="2.909">government has their own agendas and</text>
  <text start="314.78" dur="2.609">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince people that</text>
  <text start="315.979" dur="3.931">you need to be spying on all the time</text>
  <text start="317.389" dur="4.741">now we see that in California which</text>
  <text start="319.91" dur="4.92">seems to be a test bed for all new</text>
  <text start="322.13" dur="5.22">legislation and what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="5.43">since the attackers used burner phones</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="7.14">they want everyone who&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="330.26" dur="7.71">purchase a throwaway phone to have ID</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="6.84">now now of course as we know do you</text>
  <text start="337.97" dur="5.819">think a real criminal a real terrorists</text>
  <text start="341.33" dur="5.01">or anyone who wants to commit some type</text>
  <text start="343.789" dur="5.461">of crime is gonna walk in with their own</text>
  <text start="346.34" dur="5.94">ID and you know the person behind the</text>
  <text start="349.25" dur="5.46">counter they don&amp;#39;t care you can give</text>
  <text start="352.28" dur="4.229">them anything it could be fake it could</text>
  <text start="354.71" dur="4.32">be phony it doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference</text>
  <text start="356.509" dur="5.421">because they&amp;#39;ll say okay good i saw it</text>
  <text start="359.03" dur="5.52">here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s your phone no big deal and</text>
  <text start="361.93" dur="5.38">it&amp;#39;s the same thing that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="364.55" dur="5.73">going through all our lives with alcohol</text>
  <text start="367.31" dur="6.599">purchases with cigarette purchases with</text>
  <text start="370.28" dur="7.169">everything else this only controls the</text>
  <text start="373.909" dur="5.94">law abiding citizen it doesn&amp;#39;t affect</text>
  <text start="377.449" dur="7.171">the criminals because they always have a</text>
  <text start="379.849" dur="7.981">way around this and this once again is</text>
  <text start="384.62" dur="5.729">to keep the people in line and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="387.83" dur="4.649">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.349" dur="4.951">very interesting they&amp;#39;re pushing the law</text>
  <text start="392.479" dur="5.91">and they&amp;#39;re saying okay this is going to</text>
  <text start="395.3" dur="7.26">help us with drug trafficking modern-day</text>
  <text start="398.389" dur="6.09">slavery terror and they&amp;#39;re making this</text>
  <text start="402.56" dur="3.9">whole entire list to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="404.479" dur="4.68">this is why we need this this is a good</text>
  <text start="406.46" dur="5.13">idea but guess what it&amp;#39;s the same thing</text>
  <text start="409.159" dur="4.681">with every other law they pass the</text>
  <text start="411.59" dur="4.44">criminals always find a way around it</text>
  <text start="413.84" dur="4.889">and the law abiding citizen is the one</text>
  <text start="416.03" dur="5.04">who suffers for it now out in the Middle</text>
  <text start="418.729" dur="5.731">East the United States now has agreed to</text>
  <text start="421.07" dur="4.409">fund a multi-million dollar project to</text>
  <text start="424.46" dur="3.509">install an electronic security</text>
  <text start="425.479" dur="5.611">surveillance system where well in</text>
  <text start="427.969" dur="5.7">Tunisia at the border web to news</text>
  <text start="431.09" dur="4.92">yeah with Libya the u.s. is going to</text>
  <text start="433.669" dur="4.171">step in and they&amp;#39;re going to spend about</text>
  <text start="436.01" dur="4.08">twenty four point nine million to</text>
  <text start="437.84" dur="4.2">strengthen security there the US defense</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="3.15">Threat Reduction agency awarded the</text>
  <text start="442.04" dur="3.81">contract to America Construction Group</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="5.34">btp and consulting an engineering firm</text>
  <text start="445.85" dur="4.11">aecom and according to the embassy the</text>
  <text start="448.58" dur="3.45">project involves the installation of</text>
  <text start="449.96" dur="5.76">integrated surveillance systems using</text>
  <text start="452.03" dur="6.06">sensors and security and they are going</text>
  <text start="455.72" dur="4.53">to close the border now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="458.09" dur="6.06">interesting how the US has the ability</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="7.28">to spend millions of dollars installing</text>
  <text start="464.15" dur="5.88">surveillance equipment sensors and</text>
  <text start="467.53" dur="5.92">constructing walls like they did in</text>
  <text start="470.03" dur="4.74">Turkey when Jay Johnson was out there</text>
  <text start="473.45" dur="4.59">and they were setting up surveillance</text>
  <text start="474.77" dur="4.35">balloons sensors spending millions of</text>
  <text start="478.04" dur="4.53">dollars they&amp;#39;re doing the same in</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="5.609">Tunisia and here in the United States</text>
  <text start="482.57" dur="3.9">they keep telling us it&amp;#39;s impossible to</text>
  <text start="484.729" dur="4.711">close down the borders it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="486.47" dur="5.25">to monitor the borders it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="489.44" dur="3.81">to do any of this well if we take those</text>
  <text start="491.72" dur="3.54">funds and we shifted them over here to</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="4.02">the United States it might be possible</text>
  <text start="495.26" dur="4.32">but it&amp;#39;s very interesting how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.27" dur="5.7">always possible that they&amp;#39;re always able</text>
  <text start="499.58" dur="6.51">to do this out in different areas</text>
  <text start="502.97" dur="8.49">because we know why they&amp;#39;re protecting</text>
  <text start="506.09" dur="9.24">their assets their way of life the petro</text>
  <text start="511.46" dur="6.269">dollar their proxy armies like the</text>
  <text start="515.33" dur="5.99">Islamic state now the king of Jordan is</text>
  <text start="517.729" dur="6.721">blaming turkey for terror in Europe and</text>
  <text start="521.32" dur="6.43">we see that it looks like at this point</text>
  <text start="524.45" dur="6.15">that they&amp;#39;re making her on the scapegoat</text>
  <text start="527.75" dur="6.209">for all of what it&amp;#39;s been happening he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.6" dur="6.66">the crazy dictator he&amp;#39;s creating terror</text>
  <text start="533.959" dur="5.581">and it looks like he is the new poster</text>
  <text start="537.26" dur="4.5">child for everything that has gone wrong</text>
  <text start="539.54" dur="4.41">in the Middle East and most likely</text>
  <text start="541.76" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re going to push him to spark a war</text>
  <text start="543.95" dur="3.12">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re heading down</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="3.72">this path and trying to do this now</text>
  <text start="547.07" dur="4.35">remember the central bankers the US</text>
  <text start="549.08" dur="4.83">government they are just men they are</text>
  <text start="551.42" dur="6.359">not perfect they can&amp;#39;t account for every</text>
  <text start="553.91" dur="7.29">variable or anomaly that occurs in the</text>
  <text start="557.779" dur="5.641">Middle East out in Eastern Europe in the</text>
  <text start="561.2" dur="3.78">Pacific and when another country steps</text>
  <text start="563.42" dur="4.44">in and foils they&amp;#39;re playing</text>
  <text start="564.98" dur="5.909">they have to regroup recalculate replan</text>
  <text start="567.86" dur="5.039">and try to meet that goal and this is</text>
  <text start="570.889" dur="5.581">what we see them continually doing they</text>
  <text start="572.899" dur="5.25">never stop and their goal is to remove</text>
  <text start="576.47" dur="3.63">Assad no matter what it could be</text>
  <text start="578.149" dur="4.351">political it could be war however they</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="6.33">need to do it this is how they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="582.5" dur="7.44">to do it and we see that they move to</text>
  <text start="586.43" dur="5.849">different areas if they can&amp;#39;t push their</text>
  <text start="589.94" dur="4.74">agenda in a certain area they move on to</text>
  <text start="592.279" dur="4.56">somewhere else they start an incident</text>
  <text start="594.68" dur="4.17">then they come back to that area because</text>
  <text start="596.839" dur="6.391">we saw this back in 2013 they had the</text>
  <text start="598.85" dur="6.299">sarin gas attack Russia stepped in Assad</text>
  <text start="603.23" dur="3.33">removed all the chemical weapons the</text>
  <text start="605.149" dur="3.841">United States stepped away for a couple</text>
  <text start="606.56" dur="6.12">of months then came back in July with</text>
  <text start="608.99" dur="5.43">the Islamic state came back again the</text>
  <text start="612.68" dur="4.98">the next year where they started bombing</text>
  <text start="614.42" dur="5.609">inside of Syria and we see at this point</text>
  <text start="617.66" dur="3.989">Russia&amp;#39;s stepped in again foiled their</text>
  <text start="620.029" dur="5.041">plans the Islamic state is being</text>
  <text start="621.649" dur="5.31">destroyed but this will not stop them</text>
  <text start="625.07" dur="3.93">right now we see hundreds of US troops</text>
  <text start="626.959" dur="5.281">they have established a base in Iraq&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="629" dur="6.3">Western Anbar province and they have set</text>
  <text start="632.24" dur="5.73">up artillery at the site and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="635.3" dur="4.68">monitoring the borders with Syria now</text>
  <text start="637.97" dur="4.65">this is the first independent US</text>
  <text start="639.98" dur="4.349">presence in the province since 2011 and</text>
  <text start="642.62" dur="4.68">we can see there are more and more</text>
  <text start="644.329" dur="4.651">troops coming into this area now the</text>
  <text start="647.3" dur="4.38">Islamic state is being beaten and</text>
  <text start="648.98" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re being wiped out why does the</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="4.019">u.s. need more and more troops why do</text>

  <text start="714.11" dur="6.149">al-zor in Aleppo and they are really</text>
  <text start="718.1" dur="2.909">pushing the Islamic state the proxy</text>
  <text start="720.259" dur="3.211">armies the United States government</text>
  <text start="721.009" dur="4.38">central bankers out of the country and</text>
  <text start="723.47" dur="4.829">the u.s. is backed into a corner right</text>
  <text start="725.389" dur="5.16">now so what they&amp;#39;re doing they have a</text>
  <text start="728.299" dur="5.88">new focus and we know what that is their</text>
  <text start="730.549" dur="7.41">new focus is Libya their new focus are</text>
  <text start="734.179" dur="6.931">all those areas where they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="737.959" dur="7.201">problems like in Yemen in Libya we know</text>
  <text start="741.11" dur="7.079">like in Lebanon in Iraq because they</text>
  <text start="745.16" dur="5.519">need to follow along with whatever the</text>
  <text start="748.189" dur="4.32">US government central bankers say and if</text>
  <text start="750.679" dur="3.241">they don&amp;#39;t follow along where what I</text>
  <text start="752.509" dur="4.711">mean by this is they&amp;#39;re putting the</text>
  <text start="753.92" dur="4.56">dollar on their natural resources to</text>
  <text start="757.22" dur="4.13">sell it to other countries if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="758.48" dur="6.449">not following along with this agenda</text>
  <text start="761.35" dur="5.709">guess what they are going to be removed</text>
  <text start="764.929" dur="5.4">from power and those countries where</text>
  <text start="767.059" dur="6.301">they&amp;#39;ve risen up and they&amp;#39;ve taken over</text>
  <text start="770.329" dur="5.01">the puppet government those areas need</text>
  <text start="773.36" dur="3.87">to be retaken and we knew this was going</text>
  <text start="775.339" dur="4.47">to happen we knew the US was going to go</text>
  <text start="777.23" dur="4.74">back into all of these countries to</text>
  <text start="779.809" dur="4.68">reestablish puppet governments in each</text>
  <text start="781.97" dur="4.82">one of these regions and this is why</text>
  <text start="784.489" dur="4.47">they are still using the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="786.79" dur="4.389">even though the Islamic state is being</text>
  <text start="788.959" dur="4.29">wiped out in Syria they&amp;#39;ve moved them to</text>
  <text start="791.179" dur="6.45">different locations within the Middle</text>
  <text start="793.249" dur="8.19">East into Libya into Yemen into Lebanon</text>
  <text start="797.629" dur="5.88">in Iraq they&amp;#39;re still there and we see</text>
  <text start="801.439" dur="5.94">at this point that there will be more</text>
  <text start="803.509" dur="5.55">false flags their fear tactics are not</text>
  <text start="807.379" dur="4.38">going to end because their agenda their</text>
  <text start="809.059" dur="4.411">goals are always the same and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="811.759" dur="3.99">going to keep pushing and pushing</text>
  <text start="813.47" dur="4.409">because they realize and they understand</text>
  <text start="815.749" dur="5.971">if they don&amp;#39;t do this their way of life</text>
  <text start="817.879" dur="6.091">goes down the drain I mean your way of</text>
  <text start="821.72" dur="4.13">life is getting worse and worse because</text>

  <text start="828.799" dur="2.691">being closed down</text>
  <text start="831.83" dur="3.54">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is trying</text>
  <text start="833.48" dur="5.7">to keep everything propped up long</text>
  <text start="835.37" dur="6.63">enough long enough to blame this on</text>
  <text start="839.18" dur="4.14">another country another group and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="842" dur="3.65">getting tougher and tougher because</text>
  <text start="843.32" dur="5.36">Russia is not playing along with this</text>
  <text start="845.65" dur="4.96">China is not playing along with this and</text>
  <text start="848.68" dur="4.15">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen if</text>
  <text start="850.61" dur="3.93">these countries do not play along and</text>
  <text start="852.83" dur="3.27">start something because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="854.54" dur="2.88">provoking provoking provoking and they</text>
  <text start="856.1" dur="3">want these countries to do something</text>

  <text start="861.23" dur="5.61">already it&amp;#39;s happening they&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="866.84" dur="3.6">to bite so what they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="868.91" dur="3.39">do is they&amp;#39;re going to have to create a</text>
  <text start="870.44" dur="3.15">false flag and what that means is</text>
  <text start="872.3" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re going to have to create an</text>
  <text start="873.59" dur="4.86">attack and then blame it on that country</text>
  <text start="876.29" dur="5.16">to make it look like yes they did attack</text>
