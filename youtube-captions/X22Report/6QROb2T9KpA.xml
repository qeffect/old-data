  <text start="105.22" dur="5.269">foods they&amp;#39;re becoming more and more</text>
  <text start="107.02" dur="6.78">expensive and people are going to have a</text>
  <text start="110.489" dur="6.821">hard time affording these type of foods</text>
  <text start="113.8" dur="5.7">Jason we be President of changos market</text>
  <text start="117.31" dur="3.869">at the crossroads former market said</text>

  <text start="121.179" dur="3.931">tomatoes on the vine was a dollar</text>
  <text start="122.8" dur="6.72">ninety-nine a pound now he says he has</text>
  <text start="125.11" dur="8.25">to sell them at 399 pounds and this is</text>
  <text start="129.52" dur="6.03">going to spread to many many countries</text>
  <text start="133.36" dur="4.769">and eventually we&amp;#39;ll see it here in the</text>
  <text start="135.55" dur="6.03">United States we will see inflation now</text>
  <text start="138.129" dur="5.521">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing inflation since they</text>
  <text start="141.58" dur="4.98">started started the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="143.65" dur="6.27">System back in nineteen thirteen and it</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="8.94">slowly is creeping up but it really has</text>
  <text start="149.92" dur="9.3">accelerated since the 1970s and this is</text>
  <text start="155.5" dur="6.93">just going to get worse because as we</text>
  <text start="159.22" dur="4.95">know across the sea they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="162.43" dur="4.11">petro dollar</text>
  <text start="164.17" dur="3.899">and that allows countries to purchase</text>
  <text start="166.54" dur="4.65">oil from the Middle Eastern countries</text>
  <text start="168.069" dur="6.271">and as these countries one-by-one give</text>
  <text start="171.19" dur="5.31">up the petro dollar the rest of the</text>
  <text start="174.34" dur="4.68">countries do not have to hold on to the</text>
  <text start="176.5" dur="5.28">dollar in their reserves which means</text>
  <text start="179.02" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re going to send it back here to</text>
  <text start="181.78" dur="3.42">the United States of course that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="183.61" dur="4.709">simplified way of saying that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="185.2" dur="5.73">going to see inflation and as more and</text>
  <text start="188.319" dur="5.25">more dollars hit the United States it</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="5.13">devalues the dollar as the value of the</text>
  <text start="193.569" dur="5.67">dollar goes down it costs more of those</text>
  <text start="196.06" dur="4.32">dollars to pay for the products and this</text>
  <text start="199.239" dur="3.301">is what we&amp;#39;re going to see we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="200.38" dur="4.68">seeing it with food now since they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="202.54" dur="5.58">been suppressing oil and gas is getting</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="6.39">cheaper and cheaper we&amp;#39;re not seeing the</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="6.33">inflation as much but if you notice food</text>
  <text start="211.45" dur="7.23">really hasn&amp;#39;t come down that much as</text>
  <text start="214.45" dur="7.08">that much as gas continually falls a lot</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="5.19">of the products right now are shrinking</text>
  <text start="221.53" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re giving you less and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="6.32">continually seeing this but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="226.9" dur="6.35">going to see over time is everything is</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="7.359">going to go skyrocketing up just like</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="7.9">Venezuela just like Argentina just like</text>
  <text start="237.549" dur="6.78">Canada and this will spread we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.15" dur="6.51">starting to see layoffs in many many</text>
  <text start="244.329" dur="7.291">corporations and retail and global</text>
  <text start="247.66" dur="6">equities researches trip Chowdhry they</text>
  <text start="251.62" dur="5.339">are looking at the tech industry and</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="6.87">they are predicting right now we are</text>
  <text start="256.959" dur="7.621">going to see mass layoffs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.53" dur="5.73">estimating around 300,000 jobs are going</text>
  <text start="264.58" dur="5.27">to be laid off and they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="266.26" dur="8.79">certain companies like EMC VMware HP IBM</text>
  <text start="269.85" dur="7.18">Cisco Oracle Microsoft and there are</text>
  <text start="275.05" dur="4.92">many many more companies that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="277.03" dur="5.46">listed and they&amp;#39;re reporting that the</text>
  <text start="279.97" dur="6.6">layoffs can range anywhere from fifteen</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="5.58">to thirty percent of the employees in</text>
  <text start="286.57" dur="4.71">each one of these companies now let me</text>
  <text start="288.07" dur="6.089">give you an example EMC for instance</text>
  <text start="291.28" dur="5.52">they have about 70,000 employees they</text>
  <text start="294.159" dur="3.97">said anywhere between 10 and 14 thousand</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="4.659">people will be laid off</text>
  <text start="298.129" dur="5.421">they&amp;#39;re looking at HP they&amp;#39;re saying at</text>
  <text start="301.459" dur="4.23">least thirty percent there which is</text>
  <text start="303.55" dur="3.509">72,000 people they have they have a</text>
  <text start="305.689" dur="4.56">total number of employees of about</text>
  <text start="307.059" dur="6.31">240,000 IBM total number of employees</text>
  <text start="310.249" dur="8.1">379 thousand they&amp;#39;re saying 25% layoffs</text>
  <text start="313.369" dur="9.181">and looking at 95,000 people so we are</text>
  <text start="318.349" dur="7.231">going to see mass layoffs coming down</text>
  <text start="322.55" dur="6.649">here and it is going to be a bloodbath</text>
  <text start="325.58" dur="6.209">as this economy completely falls apart</text>
  <text start="329.199" dur="6.4">now a couple weeks ago we had an</text>
  <text start="331.789" dur="8.4">incident where Iran basically captured</text>
  <text start="335.599" dur="8.011">two US ships which were riverine command</text>
  <text start="340.189" dur="5.46">boats and they sailed into Iranian</text>
  <text start="343.61" dur="4.259">waters this was done on purpose they</text>
  <text start="345.649" dur="5.64">were trying to provoke Iran before the</text>
  <text start="347.869" dur="6.121">p5 plus one deal was basically sealed</text>
  <text start="351.289" dur="6.21">and they were trying and hoping that</text>
  <text start="353.99" dur="5.489">Iran with either fire on the ships or</text>
  <text start="357.499" dur="7.85">they were hoping that they would capture</text>
  <text start="359.479" dur="11.821">the soldiers and maybe bring them in and</text>
  <text start="365.349" dur="8.83">imprison them and we know whatever the</text>
  <text start="371.3" dur="6.719">mission was it was to provoke a wren or</text>
  <text start="374.179" dur="5.73">to set up some type of false flag and we</text>
  <text start="378.019" dur="5.13">are seeing now that there is a leaked</text>
  <text start="379.909" dur="6.69">Ministry of Defense report which reveals</text>
  <text start="383.149" dur="6.6">that this mission was about transporting</text>
  <text start="386.599" dur="3.99">a top Islamic state leader the proxy</text>
  <text start="389.749" dur="7.59">army for the United States government</text>
  <text start="390.589" dur="9.69">central bankers into this area to maybe</text>
  <text start="397.339" dur="7.8">caused some type of trouble and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.279" dur="7.41">saying that the leader was on board of</text>
  <text start="405.139" dur="7.14">this ship and that was not released</text>
  <text start="407.689" dur="6.93">anywhere so if this is true they were</text>
  <text start="412.279" dur="4.68">planning some type of false flag event</text>
  <text start="414.619" dur="5.01">they were planning on inserting the</text>
  <text start="416.959" dur="4.83">Islamic state into Iran because as we</text>
  <text start="419.629" dur="4.32">know the authorization for war or any</text>
  <text start="421.789" dur="4.17">other war bill that they were going to</text>
  <text start="423.949" dur="5.101">come up with it&amp;#39;s going to include</text>
  <text start="425.959" dur="5.941">al-qaeda the Islamic state al-shabaab</text>
  <text start="429.05" dur="4.32">Boko Haram you name it</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="4.049">a terrorist group they&amp;#39;re allowed to go</text>
  <text start="433.37" dur="7.38">into any country and invade that country</text>
  <text start="435.949" dur="7.861">and it seems that this was maybe one of</text>
  <text start="440.75" dur="5.22">the agendas in this now out in Libya</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="5.43">things are really heating up we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.97" dur="5.94">hearing war talk from the US we see that</text>
  <text start="449.24" dur="5.22">the Libyan border between Tunisia and</text>
  <text start="451.91" dur="4.05">Libya has been closed we understand that</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="3.95">the puppet government which they created</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="5.34">which is called the unity government is</text>
  <text start="458.41" dur="4.36">stuck in Tunisia because the elected</text>
  <text start="461.3" dur="4.2">government in Tripoli will not let them</text>
  <text start="462.77" dur="4.56">in and right now they close the border</text>
  <text start="465.5" dur="4.949">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="467.33" dur="6.53">they&amp;#39;re closing down Libya getting ready</text>
  <text start="470.449" dur="7.411">to strike everything has been prepared</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="6.429">troops are on the ground jets are on the</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="6.179">ready and when they get the green light</text>
  <text start="480.289" dur="8.281">they&amp;#39;re going into Libya we see out in</text>
  <text start="484.039" dur="9.021">Syria the Russian involvement has helped</text>
  <text start="488.57" dur="7.68">Damascus and their forces dramatically</text>
  <text start="493.06" dur="8.139">when the US was helping back in 2014 and</text>
  <text start="496.25" dur="6.71">2015 the Syrian forces lost about</text>
  <text start="501.199" dur="5.34">eighteen percent of their territory</text>
  <text start="502.96" dur="6.04">since Russia has been there they have</text>
  <text start="506.539" dur="4.891">gained almost all of this territory back</text>
  <text start="509" dur="6.479">and they&amp;#39;re pushing the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="511.43" dur="6.06">further and further eastward and of</text>
  <text start="515.479" dur="4.11">course this is a problem for the United</text>
  <text start="517.49" dur="4.32">States government central bankers now</text>
  <text start="519.589" dur="6.181">the moderate rebels they are out there</text>
  <text start="521.81" dur="6.779">and they&amp;#39;re saying listen if these talks</text>
  <text start="525.77" dur="5.189">do not go well which they&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="528.589" dur="3.661">be on the twenty-fifth of January we</text>
  <text start="530.959" dur="3.301">don&amp;#39;t know right now they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="4.17">postponed they might go on they might</text>
  <text start="534.26" dur="4.29">not go on they might be postponed one to</text>
  <text start="536.42" dur="5.34">two days they&amp;#39;re still trying to figure</text>
  <text start="538.55" dur="5.159">this out but if these talks don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="541.76" dur="5.19">well they&amp;#39;re saying they are blaming</text>
  <text start="543.709" dur="7.351">Syria and Russia for the fail talks</text>
  <text start="546.95" dur="7.59">right off the bat and we see at this</text>
  <text start="551.06" dur="7.41">point right now is they are already</text>
  <text start="554.54" dur="5.61">setting up for a failure and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.47" dur="4.859">saying that Russia is continually</text>
  <text start="560.15" dur="5.64">hitting civilians Russia is doing</text>
  <text start="563.329" dur="4.711">everything against the UN resolutions</text>
  <text start="565.79" dur="4.05">and we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="568.04" dur="3.45">trying to set up everything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="569.84" dur="3.59">going to do once the talks fail because</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="4.32">we know what the agenda of the talks are</text>
  <text start="573.43" dur="5.71">basically let&amp;#39;s break it down this is</text>
  <text start="575.81" dur="6.36">their agenda Assad must step down Assad</text>
  <text start="579.14" dur="8.91">must step down Assad must step down that</text>
  <text start="582.17" dur="9.39">is it that&amp;#39;s the scope of the talks so</text>
  <text start="588.05" dur="5.16">what are we seeing right now well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="591.56" dur="4.8">seeing Senate Majority Leader Mitch</text>
  <text start="593.21" dur="6.32">McConnell he is moving to fast track and</text>
  <text start="596.36" dur="6.74">authorization of military force the AUMF</text>
  <text start="599.53" dur="6.31">for the president that would allow</text>
  <text start="603.1" dur="6.37">unrestricted warfare against the Islamic</text>
  <text start="605.84" dur="6.86">state there be no time or Geographic</text>
  <text start="609.47" dur="5.73">restrictions on this authorization and</text>
  <text start="612.7" dur="5.65">basically it&amp;#39;s like a blank check with</text>
  <text start="615.2" dur="6.29">no expiration date and they&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="618.35" dur="6.63">to send as many forces in as they want</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="7">now we know the White House is using the</text>
  <text start="624.98" dur="6.57">sep tember 11 2001 authorization but</text>
  <text start="628.49" dur="6.69">that&amp;#39;s kind of illegal because the 2001</text>
  <text start="631.55" dur="7.76">authorization doesn&amp;#39;t apply because that</text>
  <text start="635.18" dur="7.71">resolution was only for those who</text>
  <text start="639.31" dur="6.1">planned and carried out the 911 attacks</text>
  <text start="642.89" dur="4.5">and they blame that on al-qaeda now we</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="4.5">all know this was not al-qaeda because</text>
  <text start="647.39" dur="4.71">al Qaeda was created by the CIA we know</text>
  <text start="649.91" dur="4.92">it was an inside job the United States</text>
  <text start="652.1" dur="5.28">government the Bush family Israel the</text>
  <text start="654.83" dur="6.21">Mossad agents were all involved in this</text>
  <text start="657.38" dur="6.96">and bringing down the towers but this</text>
  <text start="661.04" dur="6.57">authorization back in two thousand one</text>
  <text start="664.34" dur="5.85">does not apply to what&amp;#39;s going on right</text>
  <text start="667.61" dur="3.99">now and we know since the State of the</text>
  <text start="670.19" dur="3.33">Union the president called for the</text>
  <text start="671.6" dur="3.72">authorization for war we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="673.52" dur="3.84">push for similar bills to the</text>
  <text start="675.32" dur="4.95">authorization for war and they&amp;#39;re fast</text>
  <text start="677.36" dur="5.22">tracking it right now why are they fast</text>
  <text start="680.27" dur="6.6">tracking it because they need to bring</text>
  <text start="682.58" dur="7.85">in troops not the 200 300 500 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="686.87" dur="6.87">using those special forces to basically</text>
  <text start="690.43" dur="7.63">carve out certain portions of Syria and</text>
  <text start="693.74" dur="5.73">hold the Islamic state safe in Iraq they</text>
  <text start="698.06" dur="4.08">they have a</text>
  <text start="699.47" dur="6.29">base in Syria they&amp;#39;re setting up a whole</text>
  <text start="702.14" dur="7.2">entire area in this in in the in the</text>
  <text start="705.76" dur="5.59">northeast of Syria to basically create a</text>
  <text start="709.34" dur="3.81">safe zone they&amp;#39;ve already controlled the</text>
  <text start="711.35" dur="5.69">borders between Syria and Turkey and</text>
  <text start="713.15" dur="10.23">this is all for one reason and that</text>
  <text start="717.04" dur="9.49">reason is for a ground invasion now US</text>
  <text start="723.38" dur="6.3">Vice President Joe Biden he is out there</text>
  <text start="726.53" dur="7.86">saying that US and Turkey are now</text>
  <text start="729.68" dur="8.55">prepared for military solutions if the</text>
  <text start="734.39" dur="7.74">talks go south so it&amp;#39;s not like all of a</text>
  <text start="738.23" dur="7.17">sudden they have troops and military</text>
  <text start="742.13" dur="5.46">assets in place they have been planning</text>
