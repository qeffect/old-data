  <text start="33.64" dur="3.96">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="34.96" dur="5.4">episode 813 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="37.6" dur="5.1">november 9th 2015 and the title of this</text>
  <text start="40.36" dur="4.379">episode is russia and china are now</text>
  <text start="42.7" dur="4.74">creating a completely separate gold</text>
  <text start="44.739" dur="4.291">market away from the dollar let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="47.44" dur="4.049">right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="49.03" dur="4.41">financial news looking at the market</text>
  <text start="51.489" dur="4.681">today it looks like the high frequency</text>
  <text start="53.44" dur="4.65">traders the plunge protection team they</text>
  <text start="56.17" dur="4.38">tried everything they could but they</text>
  <text start="58.09" dur="5.039">just couldn&amp;#39;t get the market up where</text>
  <text start="60.55" dur="4.439">they wanted with finish down today and</text>
  <text start="63.129" dur="4.581">we see a lot of the market has finished</text>
  <text start="64.989" dur="5.761">down you know we had these incredible</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="4.66">job numbers that came out on friday</text>
  <text start="70.75" dur="3.21">brought the unemployment rate down to</text>
  <text start="72.37" dur="3.14">five percent were in full recovery</text>
  <text start="73.96" dur="3.96">according to the government right now</text>
  <text start="75.51" dur="4.6">and when we look closely at these job</text>
  <text start="77.92" dur="5.07">numbers which we discussed before on</text>
  <text start="80.11" dur="7.02">friday we see that a lot of these</text>
  <text start="82.99" dur="7.53">numbers are completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="87.13" dur="8.61">false and they are manipulated to the</text>
  <text start="90.52" dur="7.65">extreme I mean the BLS is out there</text>
  <text start="95.74" dur="5.4">telling us that they created 271</text>
  <text start="98.17" dur="5.64">thousand jobs in October and of course</text>
  <text start="101.14" dur="4.68">they beat expect expectations but when</text>
  <text start="103.81" dur="4.35">we look closely we see there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="105.82" dur="5.88">wrong with these numbers I mean first of</text>
  <text start="108.16" dur="7.32">all 145,000 of all the jobs or fifty</text>
  <text start="111.7" dur="6.23">four percent our jobs arbitrarily added</text>
  <text start="115.48" dur="4.77">to the number by the birth-death model</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="5.29">the birth-death model provides an</text>
  <text start="120.25" dur="4.89">estimate of the net amount of unreported</text>
  <text start="123.22" dur="3.78">jobs lost to business closings and the</text>
  <text start="125.14" dur="4.56">unreported jobs created by new business</text>
  <text start="127" dur="5.34">openings the model is based on normally</text>
  <text start="129.7" dur="4.369">functioning economy unlike the one of</text>
  <text start="132.34" dur="3.869">the past seven years and thus</text>
  <text start="134.069" dur="3.67">overestimates the number of jobs from</text>
  <text start="136.209" dur="4.261">new business and underestimates the</text>
  <text start="137.739" dur="8.701">losses from closures if we kind of get</text>
  <text start="140.47" dur="11.07">rid of all this the birth-death model we</text>
  <text start="146.44" dur="8.37">only added about 126,000 jobs and we</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="7.05">have to say who got these jobs well it</text>
  <text start="154.81" dur="6.36">was low-paying part-time work so we went</text>
  <text start="158.59" dur="5.34">from full-time jobs and they were</text>
  <text start="161.17" dur="6">replaced with part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="6.08">and it went to those people 55 and older</text>
  <text start="167.17" dur="5.989">so let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="170.01" dur="5.679">this is not indicative of a recovery</text>
  <text start="173.159" dur="6.28">what we&amp;#39;re doing is we&amp;#39;re swapping out</text>
  <text start="175.689" dur="6.39">full-time to part-time and the older</text>
  <text start="179.439" dur="5.041">population is taking up the jobs the</text>
  <text start="182.079" dur="6.091">younger population they cannot find work</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="6.929">whatsoever so this five percent number</text>
  <text start="188.17" dur="7.189">is completely meaningless and what is</text>
  <text start="191.409" dur="3.95">really going on in the labor force</text>
  <text start="196.769" dur="5.351">normally during a real economic recovery</text>
  <text start="199.599" dur="5.301">people enter the labor force and the</text>
  <text start="202.12" dur="5.58">partition the participation rate rises</text>
  <text start="204.9" dur="5.41">but we&amp;#39;re seeing the opposite occur</text>
  <text start="207.7" dur="6.09">right now so if we were actually in a</text>
  <text start="210.31" dur="5.099">recovery would half of the 25 year-old</text>
  <text start="213.79" dur="6.3">population be living with their parents</text>
  <text start="215.409" dur="8.7">I mean right now the real job situation</text>
  <text start="220.09" dur="7.229">is so poor that young people are unable</text>
  <text start="224.109" dur="7.5">to form households at this point that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.319" dur="7.29">how bad it is and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="231.609" dur="4.891">rest of the industry and we look through</text>
  <text start="234.609" dur="3.59">these manipulated numbers they</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="6.12">continually throw at us we see that</text>
  <text start="238.199" dur="5.771">everything is the opposite of what the</text>
  <text start="242.62" dur="4.319">US government is telling us I mean look</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="6.84">at caterpillar for instance 34 months of</text>
  <text start="246.939" dur="7.14">non existing sales I mean basically the</text>
  <text start="250.81" dur="6.66">entire industrial market is in a</text>
  <text start="254.079" dur="7.201">full-fledged depression and we have</text>
  <text start="257.47" dur="6.09">proof of this because we see that the</text>
  <text start="261.28" dur="4.68">equipment of caterpillar which normally</text>
  <text start="263.56" dur="5.359">costs like 2.9 million dollars and this</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="6.15">is a caterpillar 99 to see wheel loader</text>
  <text start="268.919" dur="5.43">can be bought for fifteen thousand</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="4.559">dollars a ninety-nine percent discount</text>
  <text start="274.349" dur="3.94">this is because they can&amp;#39;t get rid of</text>
  <text start="276.669" dur="4.711">their equipment there&amp;#39;s no one out there</text>
  <text start="278.289" dur="7.861">to sell it to right now because the</text>
  <text start="281.38" dur="8.61">entire thing is collapsing and we see</text>
  <text start="286.15" dur="8.73">for thirty four months caterpillar has</text>
  <text start="289.99" dur="7.23">had terrible terrible sales 34 months</text>
  <text start="294.88" dur="4.08">compared to the recession</text>
  <text start="297.22" dur="5.28">recession which was nineteen months of</text>
  <text start="298.96" dur="9.42">negative sales we&amp;#39;re seeing 34 months of</text>
  <text start="302.5" dur="10.53">negative sales this shows us that we are</text>
  <text start="308.38" dur="6.81">completely not in a recovery whatsoever</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="4.41">the both the Dry Index which is the raw</text>
  <text start="315.19" dur="7.89">material for goods has dropped once</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="7.89">again to 628 points continually falling</text>
  <text start="323.08" dur="4.56">this is the raw material the factor is</text>
  <text start="325.33" dur="6.3">used to produce goods these goods then</text>
  <text start="327.64" dur="8.82">are sold to stores businesses and you</text>
  <text start="331.63" dur="8.33">know the people go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="6.69">these goods but we&amp;#39;re not seeing this</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="5.92">people are being laid off people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="4.11">have this discretionary funds and this</text>
  <text start="345.88" dur="3.51">is why we see the ball to our index</text>
  <text start="347.26" dur="5.22">continually falling usually at this time</text>
  <text start="349.39" dur="6.66">the Baltic Dry Index is rising we are</text>
  <text start="352.48" dur="5.82">not seeing this whatsoever now a former</text>
  <text start="356.05" dur="6.15">chief US accountant is saying that the</text>
  <text start="358.3" dur="9">u.s. debt is three times more than you</text>
  <text start="362.2" dur="7.62">think the former US Comptroller says</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="5.49">right now the u.s. debt is around 65</text>
  <text start="369.82" dur="5.13">trillion then the 18 trillion that is</text>
  <text start="372.79" dur="4.83">being said to us then we hear things</text>
  <text start="374.95" dur="4.65">like no it&amp;#39;s really around 200 trillion</text>
  <text start="377.62" dur="6.78">but let&amp;#39;s go with the sixty five</text>
  <text start="379.6" dur="6.48">trillion he is saying thanks to unfunded</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="10.89">liabilities which simply cannot be</text>
  <text start="386.08" dur="14.31">ignored we have a debt that is about 65</text>
  <text start="395.29" dur="8.189">trillion dollars and there&amp;#39;s no way to</text>
  <text start="400.39" dur="4.89">pay this off he&amp;#39;s saying that Americans</text>
  <text start="403.479" dur="4.651">have lost touch with reality when it</text>
  <text start="405.28" dur="7.17">comes to spending yeah well this is this</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="6.9">is absolutely true because the American</text>
  <text start="412.45" dur="6.27">people the American government when you</text>
  <text start="415.03" dur="5.1">have in a credit card and 11 unlimited</text>
  <text start="418.72" dur="5.73">credit card like the United States</text>
  <text start="420.13" dur="8.43">government they will continually spend</text>
  <text start="424.45" dur="5.85">and spend and spend and spend and for</text>
  <text start="428.56" dur="2.52">those people you know what I mean I was</text>
  <text start="430.3" dur="3.239">caught up in that</text>
  <text start="431.08" dur="3.959">at one time where you get that credit</text>
  <text start="433.539" dur="2.97">card a lot of people get the credit card</text>
  <text start="435.039" dur="4.291">right after high school sometimes in</text>
  <text start="436.509" dur="5.25">college and all of a sudden you have the</text>
  <text start="439.33" dur="5.309">ability just to swipe it and all of a</text>
  <text start="441.759" dur="4.171">sudden you can make a purchase and you</text>
  <text start="444.639" dur="3.691">don&amp;#39;t worry about the payment until</text>
  <text start="445.93" dur="3.72">later well this is what the US</text>
  <text start="448.33" dur="3.839">government&amp;#39;s been doing this is what a</text>
  <text start="449.65" dur="7.799">lot of people are doing and we have lost</text>
  <text start="452.169" dur="7.981">sense of what real money is and this was</text>
  <text start="457.449" dur="6.601">part of their plan and we see right now</text>
  <text start="460.15" dur="6">that this is a huge problem here in the</text>
  <text start="464.05" dur="3.929">United States especially when everyone</text>
  <text start="466.15" dur="3.78">is losing their jobs especially when</text>
  <text start="467.979" dur="4.56">prices are going up especially when</text>
  <text start="469.93" dur="4.62">people are making less and we</text>
  <text start="472.539" dur="5.641">continually take on more and more debt</text>
  <text start="474.55" dur="5.579">it doesn&amp;#39;t work out in the end and we</text>
  <text start="478.18" dur="4.56">know the central bankers the US</text>
  <text start="480.129" dur="5.07">government they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="482.74" dur="4.709">possibly can to make it that everyone</text>
  <text start="485.199" dur="4.74">goes electronic they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="487.449" dur="5.15">to have cash whatsoever and right now</text>
  <text start="489.939" dur="6.63">the central bankers are moving towards a</text>
  <text start="492.599" dur="8.671">cashless society they need a cashless</text>
  <text start="496.569" dur="7.35">society to keep this system operational</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="4.78">they&amp;#39;re nervous about people taking cash</text>
  <text start="503.919" dur="4.86">out about taking it out of the system</text>
  <text start="506.05" dur="5.579">and they cannot let this happen right</text>
  <text start="508.779" dur="6.12">now there are test cases around the</text>
  <text start="511.629" dur="7.381">world because there is a war on cash and</text>
  <text start="514.899" dur="6.841">it&amp;#39;s advancing on all fronts one area</text>
  <text start="519.01" dur="5.49">that is pretty much getting rid of all</text>
  <text start="521.74" dur="4.65">physical currency is Scandinavia Sweden</text>
  <text start="524.5" dur="4.649">became the first country to enlist its</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="5.52">own citizens as largely willing guinea</text>
  <text start="529.149" dur="6.781">pigs negative interest rates in a</text>
  <text start="531.91" dur="5.76">cashless society credit Swiss reports no</text>
  <text start="535.93" dur="4.29">matter where you go or what you want to</text>
  <text start="537.67" dur="7.979">purchase you will find a small sign</text>
  <text start="540.22" dur="7.38">saying we don&amp;#39;t accept cash a similar</text>
  <text start="545.649" dur="3.031">situation is unfolding in Denmark where</text>
  <text start="547.6" dur="4.16">nearly forty percent of the pain</text>
  <text start="548.68" dur="6.39">Democratic demographic uses mobile pay</text>
  <text start="551.76" dur="8.74">which is all payments on using a</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="9.53">smartphone in Africa the sub-saharan</text>
  <text start="560.5" dur="7.559">Africa people do not have bank accounts</text>
  <text start="564.6" dur="5.529">but they do have mobile phones and right</text>
  <text start="568.059" dur="7.65">now they are pushing a cashless society</text>
  <text start="570.129" dur="10.26">in this area and these are all test</text>
  <text start="575.709" dur="12.771">cases and this will then spread to other</text>
  <text start="580.389" dur="10.92">countries and paying with cash is</text>
  <text start="588.48" dur="5.44">basically a better alternative than no</text>
  <text start="591.309" dur="5.37">cash one reason is you can hold it</text>
  <text start="593.92" dur="4.409">physically second of all you know how</text>
  <text start="596.679" dur="3.681">much you have and how much you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="598.329" dur="5.76">spending third of all there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="600.36" dur="9.189">intermediaries so someone doesn&amp;#39;t profit</text>
  <text start="604.089" dur="12.03">from the transaction using no cash</text>
  <text start="609.549" dur="8.491">there&amp;#39;s always a middleman and what</text>
  <text start="616.119" dur="4.801">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="618.04" dur="5.669">central banks they need to get rid of</text>
  <text start="620.92" dur="3.81">the cash they&amp;#39;re nervous because of what</text>
  <text start="623.709" dur="3.24">happened in Greece where the people</text>
  <text start="624.73" dur="5.039">started to remove their funds from the</text>
  <text start="626.949" dur="5.79">banks and as more and more people remove</text>
  <text start="629.769" dur="4.35">their funds it gets harder and harder to</text>
  <text start="632.739" dur="4.801">do balance because part of the bail-in</text>
  <text start="634.119" dur="8.791">process is to trap those funds inside</text>
  <text start="637.54" dur="7.859">the banks and with negative interest</text>
  <text start="642.91" dur="5.69">rates they&amp;#39;re very nervous about people</text>
  <text start="645.399" dur="8.67">taking their funds out of the bank and</text>
  <text start="648.6" dur="6.579">keeping it not using it and the only way</text>
  <text start="654.069" dur="4.23">that the central banks can maintain</text>
  <text start="655.179" dur="7.65">negative interest rates is by abolishing</text>
  <text start="658.299" dur="7.65">cash all together I mean if we listen to</text>
  <text start="662.829" dur="6.54">chief economist Andrew hat Elaine from</text>
  <text start="665.949" dur="6.33">Bank of England as long as cash exists</text>

  <text start="686.29" dur="5.339">do this at this point and we will see</text>
  <text start="689.35" dur="4.829">this accelerate we will see it seep into</text>

  <text start="709" dur="5.7">weaken the euro and push up inflation</text>
  <text start="710.98" dur="7.17">and this is very strange because out in</text>
  <text start="714.7" dur="5.58">Europe they want to push negative</text>
  <text start="718.15" dur="5.88">interest rates to weaken the euro and</text>
