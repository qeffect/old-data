  <text start="34.52" dur="6.73">countries around the world are now</text>
  <text start="36.84" dur="7.68">dumping the petro dollar let&amp;#39;s get right</text>
  <text start="41.25" dur="6.87">into the economic collapse news now we</text>
  <text start="44.52" dur="6.24">understand that Greece they made their</text>
  <text start="48.12" dur="3.689">first payment a lot of talking heads are</text>
  <text start="50.76" dur="2.61">out there saying they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="51.809" dur="2.52">able to make their next payment they</text>
  <text start="53.37" dur="2.82">have to remember their rating the</text>
  <text start="54.329" dur="4.761">pension funds they&amp;#39;re trying to find</text>
  <text start="56.19" dur="4.68">money anywhere they possibly can and we</text>
  <text start="59.09" dur="5.97">understand they&amp;#39;ve been making a deal</text>
  <text start="60.87" dur="6.95">with Russia to spur economic growth and</text>
  <text start="65.06" dur="5.11">we see the International Monetary Fund</text>
  <text start="67.82" dur="6.64">they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s nothing to worry</text>
  <text start="70.17" dur="7.17">about they don&amp;#39;t see Greece exiting</text>
  <text start="74.46" dur="6.15">whatsoever and I&amp;#39;ve said this in many</text>
  <text start="77.34" dur="5.49">many reports whenever you hear a</text>
  <text start="80.61" dur="3.06">government official central banker</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="3.87">doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="83.67" dur="5.129">say something always think the opposite</text>
  <text start="86.7" dur="3.959">if they tell you we&amp;#39;re in a recovery we</text>
  <text start="88.799" dur="4.951">know we&amp;#39;re in a collapsed situation if</text>
  <text start="90.659" dur="7.561">they say that Greece is not exiting</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="6.869">guess what they&amp;#39;re going to exit it</text>
  <text start="98.22" dur="6.75">seems they try to convince you the other</text>
  <text start="100.619" dur="7.171">way and then the opposite happens we see</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="4.5">here in the United States where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="107.79" dur="2.189">trying to convince us that everything is</text>
  <text start="109.47" dur="3.39">fine</text>
  <text start="109.979" dur="5.371">the initial jobless claims they jumped</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="4.41">12,000 from a revised two hundred eighty</text>
  <text start="115.35" dur="5.1">two thousand to two hundred and ninety</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="5.75">four thousand back above the average for</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="5.55">the year and it seems like they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="123.02" dur="5.709">manipulating all these numbers so people</text>
  <text start="126" dur="4.289">don&amp;#39;t realize what&amp;#39;s really going on we</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="3.961">see a lot more companies starting to</text>
  <text start="130.289" dur="3.271">layoff SanDisk is going to let go about</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="4.049">five</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="7.53">of its workers that&amp;#39;s about 435 people</text>
  <text start="136.739" dur="8.011">in the oil industry we see there are</text>
  <text start="141.09" dur="9.36">over a hundred thousand people who have</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="6.69">been laid off this is not a good</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="3.03">situation and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="3.96">about this is that when they come out</text>
  <text start="153.48" dur="4.89">with the unemployment numbers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="5.22">count these people whatsoever even in</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="6.949">the initial jobless claims they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="6.63">count these people because if they did</text>
  <text start="165.319" dur="4.48">it would make everything out of whack</text>
  <text start="167.25" dur="4.26">and it would skew everything they</text>
  <text start="169.799" dur="5.821">manipulated it would make sense anymore</text>
  <text start="171.51" dur="6.63">and we talked about how the college</text>
  <text start="175.62" dur="6.75">graduates are having problems getting</text>
  <text start="178.14" dur="6.12">jobs and all of a sudden we see that the</text>
  <text start="182.37" dur="4.71">job prospects for recent college</text>
  <text start="184.26" dur="3.69">graduates are deteriorating this is</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="3.659">coming out of the corporate media</text>
  <text start="187.95" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re finally admitting there is a</text>
  <text start="190.739" dur="4.351">problem but the reason why they have to</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="4.34">admit it is because they&amp;#39;re getting to a</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="6.09">point where all these college students</text>
  <text start="198.2" dur="4.33">can&amp;#39;t pay back their loans how do they</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="3.39">explain it so they finally have two</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="3.66">commands like yeah it&amp;#39;s deteriorating a</text>
  <text start="204.57" dur="3.86">little bit but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="5.31">numbers and this is coming from the BLS</text>
  <text start="208.43" dur="5.71">graduates with bachelor degrees under</text>
  <text start="211.5" dur="5.73">their model unemployment has climbed a</text>
  <text start="214.14" dur="5.58">fourteen point nine percent now of</text>
  <text start="217.23" dur="5.069">course we know this number is probably</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="4.079">triple this because they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="222.299" dur="3.72">that unemployment is five and a half</text>
  <text start="223.799" dur="5.791">percent and we know this is getting</text>
  <text start="226.019" dur="6.151">close to 30 and if college graduates is</text>
  <text start="229.59" dur="4.86">at four point fourteen point nine we</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="5.73">know that this most likely is around</text>
  <text start="234.45" dur="7.319">forty five percent or so because we know</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="5.85">they don&amp;#39;t count everyone and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.769" dur="5.22">happening now is that the student loans</text>
  <text start="243.75" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re due there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="246.989" dur="4.08">people that cannot pay off their student</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="2.91">loans they can&amp;#39;t make the monthly</text>
  <text start="251.069" dur="3.721">payments they&amp;#39;re living with their</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="5.099">parents they can&amp;#39;t find high-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="5.46">and they they have to admit it after a</text>
  <text start="257.729" dur="4.471">while because things don&amp;#39;t make sense so</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="4.56">they come up with a story that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.2" dur="5.38">slowly deteriorating but we know from</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="5.02">the past reports college about eighty</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="7.679">none of them cannot find real work and</text>
  <text start="269.83" dur="8.7">it&amp;#39;s getting worse I mean my wife&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.259" dur="4.88">cousin graduating Binghamton has a</text>
  <text start="278.53" dur="3.84">part-time job</text>
  <text start="280.139" dur="3.75">he doesn&amp;#39;t need a college degree to get</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="5.039">a part-time job</text>
  <text start="283.889" dur="4.84">can&amp;#39;t find that full-time job actually</text>
  <text start="287.409" dur="5.54">most of the college graduates coming out</text>
  <text start="288.729" dur="7.41">of school have no skills whatsoever a</text>
  <text start="292.949" dur="6.49">degree is really meaningless today</text>
  <text start="296.139" dur="6.81">unless you have some skills what can you</text>
  <text start="299.439" dur="5.79">actually do but instead what they have</text>
  <text start="302.949" dur="5.28">is about 25 to 29 thousand dollars worth</text>
  <text start="305.229" dur="4.65">of debt and no real skills this is what</text>
