  <text start="100.969" dur="8.551">system that has been alive in this</text>
  <text start="105.049" dur="5.13">country since 1913 it is all coming to</text>
  <text start="109.52" dur="3.059">an end</text>
  <text start="110.179" dur="4.021">and we can see that the central bank</text>
  <text start="112.579" dur="3.481">economy remember there&amp;#39;s two economies</text>
  <text start="114.2" dur="4.709">happening right now we have the economy</text>
  <text start="116.06" dur="6.059">that trump is creating bringing back</text>
  <text start="118.909" dur="5.99">jobs bringing back manufacturing big and</text>
  <text start="122.119" dur="6.301">bringing back corporations creating</text>
  <text start="124.899" dur="5.47">different zones so corporations come in</text>
  <text start="128.42" dur="4.5">and say hey thanks for the tax incentive</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="4.681">I will set up shop here I will create</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="4.649">jobs which will then in turn create</text>
  <text start="135.05" dur="4.86">other jobs because when people have jobs</text>
  <text start="137.569" dur="4.701">they have money they can go spend it on</text>
  <text start="139.91" dur="6.21">shopping so stores will pop up</text>
  <text start="142.27" dur="5.77">restaurants will pop up and the entire</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="3.08">area will start to grow and this is many</text>
  <text start="148.04" dur="3.36">different areas across the country</text>
  <text start="149.2" dur="5.47">remember a lot of these areas have been</text>
  <text start="151.4" dur="5.1">hurting for a very long time but the</text>
  <text start="154.67" dur="5.399">people&amp;#39;s economy and this is the central</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="5.549">bank&amp;#39;s economy this economy is falling</text>
  <text start="160.069" dur="3.661">apart it was never designed to last it</text>
  <text start="162.049" dur="4.08">was never designed to go</text>
  <text start="163.73" dur="4.08">seventy eighty ninety years it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="166.129" dur="5.19">meant to go between forty and fifty</text>
  <text start="167.81" dur="6.27">years then it implodes under the weight</text>
  <text start="171.319" dur="5.571">of debt that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="174.08" dur="6.81">now and if we look at the housing market</text>
  <text start="176.89" dur="7.569">this is an indicator on how the central</text>
  <text start="180.89" dur="6.209">bank&amp;#39;s blow up bubbles then try to pop</text>
  <text start="184.459" dur="4.771">them and bring the system down if you</text>
  <text start="187.099" dur="4.381">look at California New York Florida</text>
  <text start="189.23" dur="5.22">Texas and all around the country you can</text>
  <text start="191.48" dur="4.8">see where these bubbles are how they</text>
  <text start="194.45" dur="4.009">created them and we went over this many</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="5.61">many times before where we had</text>
  <text start="198.459" dur="5.291">investment companies buy up thousands</text>
  <text start="201.89" dur="3.54">upon thousands of house keep them off</text>
  <text start="203.75" dur="2.97">the market rent them if they could but</text>
  <text start="205.43" dur="3.899">make sure they were off the market to</text>
  <text start="206.72" dur="6.54">drive the prices back up the central</text>
  <text start="209.329" dur="6.99">bank lowered interest rates and this way</text>
  <text start="213.26" dur="4.199">more people entered the market and we</text>
  <text start="216.319" dur="2.73">saw what happened when they were started</text>
  <text start="217.459" dur="3.75">to raise interest rates things started</text>
  <text start="219.049" dur="4.321">to fall apart but if we look out in</text>
  <text start="221.209" dur="4.89">California we see there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="4.35">problem happening here in all these</text>
  <text start="226.099" dur="3.301">states that are implementing more and</text>
  <text start="227.72" dur="3.87">more taxes why because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="229.4" dur="4.41">completely bankrupt this is what happens</text>
  <text start="231.59" dur="5.429">at the end of a system they need to</text>
  <text start="233.81" dur="3.87">implement tax after tax after tax just</text>
  <text start="237.019" dur="3.631">to stay afloat</text>
  <text start="237.68" dur="5.61">does it work no as we can see from past</text>
  <text start="240.65" dur="4.32">examples all it does is allow them to</text>
  <text start="243.29" dur="3">kick the can down the street for a</text>
  <text start="244.97" dur="3.329">little while longer</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="4.89">but while they&amp;#39;re kicking the can down</text>
  <text start="248.299" dur="5.491">the street what happens people start to</text>
  <text start="251.18" dur="4.679">move out of the states this is what we</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="4.169">see happening in New York recede</text>
  <text start="255.859" dur="6.361">happening in California and many other</text>
  <text start="257.959" dur="6.451">states around the country now the places</text>
  <text start="262.22" dur="4.68">where they created these bubbles well</text>
  <text start="264.41" dur="4.97">guess what people are starting to say</text>
  <text start="266.9" dur="8.28">you know what I can&amp;#39;t live here anymore</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="9.659">in California we are seeing County after</text>
  <text start="275.18" dur="6.12">County where growth has slowed the</text>
  <text start="279.039" dur="4.841">population of Silicon Valley the</text>
  <text start="281.3" dur="5.79">counties of San Mateo Santa Clara and</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="5.34">San Francisco only grew by 9,000 people</text>
  <text start="287.09" dur="5.55">in the 12-month period from July 1st</text>
  <text start="289.22" dur="5.879">2018 and it grew in all three counties</text>
  <text start="292.64" dur="4.38">but it was the smallest growth since</text>
  <text start="295.099" dur="4.711">2010 and</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="5.96">1/5 of the growth rate between 2011 and</text>
  <text start="299.81" dur="6.54">2015 which ranged between 45,000 to</text>
  <text start="302.98" dur="6.7">51,000 so think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="306.35" dur="6.12">the growth in California is declining in</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="4.98">many different counties Los Angeles</text>
  <text start="312.47" dur="6.06">northern counties the southern counties</text>
  <text start="314.66" dur="8.58">and we can see that if we go back in</text>
  <text start="318.53" dur="8.76">time to 2014 or 2013 12 2012 we see that</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="9.11">the California population growth was</text>
  <text start="327.29" dur="8.34">around 320,000 and 2013 are almost like</text>
  <text start="332.35" dur="8.04">345,000 in 2014 and then when we hit</text>
  <text start="335.63" dur="10.17">2015 and went down to 320 down to 270</text>
  <text start="340.39" dur="8.86">down to 190 down to 160 and you can see</text>
  <text start="345.8" dur="5.82">the trend over time now think about it</text>
  <text start="349.25" dur="6.11">California with the fires that are going</text>
  <text start="351.62" dur="5.94">on with people leaving and the</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="3.49">government completely corrupt cubist</text>
  <text start="357.56" dur="3.71">been telling us about this for a very</text>
  <text start="358.85" dur="6.75">long time we need to go back to post</text>
  <text start="361.27" dur="7.96">1368 and cue told us back then to watch</text>
  <text start="365.6" dur="6.06">California and I think what is happening</text>
  <text start="369.23" dur="5.34">out in California the entire state&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="371.66" dur="5.1">going to implode on itself and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="374.57" dur="4.68">going to see major major change out</text>
  <text start="376.76" dur="4.71">there not just with voting not just with</text>
  <text start="379.25" dur="4.41">what is happening but I think with the</text>
  <text start="381.47" dur="5.01">whole government structure which is</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="6.69">completely corrupt if we go back to post</text>
  <text start="386.48" dur="6.57">26 21 and annan says will voter fraud in</text>
  <text start="390.35" dur="6.39">California ever be brought to light Q</text>
  <text start="393.05" dur="7.11">says yes watch California was deliberate</text>
  <text start="396.74" dur="6.45">so yes voter fraud is going to be</text>
  <text start="400.16" dur="6.57">brought into the light but Q is saying</text>
  <text start="403.19" dur="5.94">watch California and it&amp;#39;s watch it</text>
  <text start="406.73" dur="5.09">because we you want to see how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.13" dur="6.15">falling apart first we had the fires</text>
  <text start="411.82" dur="6.46">then we can see that the economy is</text>
  <text start="415.28" dur="6.33">failing the housing market is imploding</text>
  <text start="418.28" dur="7.14">and you can see they&amp;#39;re fighting Trump</text>
  <text start="421.61" dur="6.24">with walls and everything like that the</text>
  <text start="425.42" dur="3.84">entire corrupt system the economic</text>
  <text start="427.85" dur="3.06">system we know they&amp;#39;re in a huge amount</text>
  <text start="429.26" dur="4.71">of debt is going to in</text>
  <text start="430.91" dur="6.38">load and I believe we&amp;#39;re watching all of</text>
  <text start="433.97" dur="6.12">this in real time we&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="437.29" dur="7.05">California New York and many other</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="8.25">states implode because of this economic</text>
  <text start="444.34" dur="6.43">debt burden and as the state implodes</text>
  <text start="448.34" dur="5.28">guess what happened to the corruption</text>
  <text start="450.77" dur="4.29">the corruption is then exposed because</text>
  <text start="453.62" dur="4.56">people want answers people want to know</text>
  <text start="455.06" dur="6.51">why this happened and I believe the plan</text>
  <text start="458.18" dur="7.31">here is to allow the central bank system</text>
  <text start="461.57" dur="5.7">to do what it does best and what is that</text>
  <text start="465.49" dur="4.57">implode on itself</text>
  <text start="467.27" dur="5.34">remember Trump has been continually</text>
  <text start="470.06" dur="4.86">pointing the finger at the Fed telling</text>
  <text start="472.61" dur="4.68">everyone it&amp;#39;s the Fed fault if they do</text>
  <text start="474.92" dur="5.19">anything now think about the Fed at this</text>
  <text start="477.29" dur="5.4">point if they raise rates Trump blames</text>
  <text start="480.11" dur="3.33">them if they lower rates and the economy</text>
  <text start="482.69" dur="3.9">falls apart</text>
  <text start="483.44" dur="6.63">Trump blames them there&amp;#39;s no place for</text>
  <text start="486.59" dur="5.7">them to go they don&amp;#39;t have an event that</text>
  <text start="490.07" dur="6.39">they can blame it on they&amp;#39;re sitting out</text>
  <text start="492.29" dur="6.57">in the light and they can&amp;#39;t scurry off</text>
  <text start="496.46" dur="5.97">into the darkness there&amp;#39;s no place to go</text>
  <text start="498.86" dur="6.18">and we see that they&amp;#39;re having a huge</text>
  <text start="502.43" dur="5.04">problem with this now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="505.04" dur="6.03">interesting is that Trump is trying to</text>
  <text start="507.47" dur="5.55">bring back the energy market into the</text>
  <text start="511.07" dur="4.11">United States we need to be energy</text>
  <text start="513.02" dur="5">independent because once we come off the</text>
  <text start="515.18" dur="5.549">petrodollar system guess what</text>
  <text start="518.02" dur="5.17">everything completely changes and you</text>
  <text start="520.729" dur="4.951">can see why Trump is trying to make the</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="5.43">United States energy independent and</text>
  <text start="525.68" dur="6.6">he&amp;#39;s trying to bring back coal mining</text>
  <text start="528.62" dur="5.91">and we see that Obama error judges</text>
  <text start="532.28" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re putting the brakes on this a</text>
  <text start="534.53" dur="4.29">federal judge in Montana delayed a Trump</text>
  <text start="537.17" dur="4.56">administration attempt to open up more</text>
  <text start="538.82" dur="4.95">federal lands to coal mining US District</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="3.42">Court Judge Brian Morris ruled that the</text>
  <text start="543.77" dur="3.87">Trump administration illegally</text>
  <text start="545.15" dur="5.55">overturned a moratorium placed on coal</text>
  <text start="547.64" dur="6.99">mining on federal lands by former</text>
  <text start="550.7" dur="5.73">President Obama now Obama in state of</text>
  <text start="554.63" dur="4.65">the policy in 2016 as part of his</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="4.71">administration&amp;#39;s environmental agenda to</text>
  <text start="559.28" dur="5.46">cut coal usage remember this is because</text>
  <text start="561.14" dur="6.84">of climate change and we can see that</text>
  <text start="564.74" dur="5.16">all of these Obama era judges are going</text>
  <text start="567.98" dur="3.9">to try to stop Trump I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="569.9" dur="4.46">stopping him on immigration they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="571.88" dur="7.07">stopping him on energy independence</text>
  <text start="574.36" dur="8.2">because they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="578.95" dur="5.95">everything the way it was they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="582.56" dur="4.23">want the United States to be energy</text>
  <text start="584.9" dur="4.29">independent they don&amp;#39;t want to stop the</text>
  <text start="586.79" dur="4.86">immigrants the illegal immigrants coming</text>
  <text start="589.19" dur="5.39">in from this country they want to</text>
  <text start="591.65" dur="5.76">continue on with their goal their goal</text>
  <text start="594.58" dur="5.02">is to bring down the United States their</text>
  <text start="597.41" dur="4.62">goal is to transfer everything out of</text>
  <text start="599.6" dur="4.26">the United States their goal is to bring</text>
  <text start="602.03" dur="6.15">the United States to its knees</text>
  <text start="603.86" dur="5.97">economically militarily and everything</text>
  <text start="608.18" dur="4.56">else and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="609.83" dur="5.85">trying to do for a very long time and as</text>
  <text start="612.74" dur="5.97">you can see once the petro dollar is</text>
  <text start="615.68" dur="5.91">gone once we are no longer the reserve</text>
  <text start="618.71" dur="5.31">currency we will need to be energy</text>
  <text start="621.59" dur="5.19">independent we&amp;#39;ll also need to have</text>
  <text start="624.02" dur="4.47">incredible trade deals because the</text>
  <text start="626.78" dur="3.71">system the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="628.49" dur="4.98">bankers have set up will no longer work</text>
  <text start="630.49" dur="6.01">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that we</text>
  <text start="633.47" dur="5.13">can see that the public they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="636.5" dur="5.67">to wake up and they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="638.6" dur="5.58">question the federal reserve richard ron</text>
  <text start="642.17" dur="4.02">has a column in The Washington Times</text>
  <text start="644.18" dur="4.38">that raises the question about the feds</text>
  <text start="646.19" dur="5.16">role in modern economy here&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="648.56" dur="5.31">portion of it is there a need for the</text>

  <text start="653.87" dur="5.58">policy mistakes too long to even</text>
  <text start="656.48" dur="4.71">summarize here the problem has been the</text>
  <text start="659.45" dur="3.9">assumption that the Fed had better</text>
  <text start="661.19" dur="4.62">information and tools than it had at</text>
  <text start="663.35" dur="5.34">times it was expected to lean against</text>
  <text start="665.81" dur="5.37">the wind as if it had information not</text>
  <text start="668.69" dur="5.67">available to the market or smarter</text>
  <text start="671.18" dur="5.37">people in Hayekian terms it suffered</text>
  <text start="674.36" dur="4.71">from the pretense of knowledge at this</text>

  <text start="681.11" dur="4.17">held the high level positions at the Fed</text>
  <text start="682.73" dur="4.53">including regional bank presidents have</text>
  <text start="685.28" dur="4.41">begun discussions about setting up a new</text>
  <text start="687.26" dur="5.67">Commission to rethink the whole idea of</text>
  <text start="689.69" dur="5.84">the Fed and its activities the structure</text>
  <text start="692.93" dur="3.84">that now exists is a jerry-built</text>
  <text start="695.53" dur="2.86">concoction</text>
  <text start="696.77" dur="3.23">that has been assembled in bits and</text>

  <text start="700" dur="7.33">increasingly appears to be past its</text>
  <text start="703.01" dur="9.72">expiration date you can see right now</text>
  <text start="707.33" dur="8.509">that people are questioning do we really</text>

  <text start="715.839" dur="4.091">restructure it</text>
  <text start="717.32" dur="5.28">remember Q&amp;#39;s post the Fed will be</text>
  <text start="719.93" dur="5.4">restructured gold will bring down the</text>
  <text start="722.6" dur="5.21">Fed and it looks like there are</text>
  <text start="725.33" dur="7.17">individuals out there who are already</text>
  <text start="727.81" dur="7.57">rethinking the whole idea on how the Fed</text>
  <text start="732.5" dur="5.39">should exist and we see that Trump is</text>
  <text start="735.38" dur="5.1">bringing in his own people with</text>
  <text start="737.89" dur="5.77">completely new ideas they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="740.48" dur="7.38">outside the system to rethink how the</text>
  <text start="743.66" dur="5.73">Fed should be used and the way I believe</text>
  <text start="747.86" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s going to be used as it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="749.39" dur="5.16">be exposed and then it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="751.37" dur="5.64">restructured where the people create</text>
  <text start="754.55" dur="4.08">their currency and there is no interest</text>
  <text start="757.01" dur="4.59">attached whatsoever</text>
  <text start="758.63" dur="4.86">Larry white and John Stossel also have</text>
  <text start="761.6" dur="4.77">questioned the role and power of the</text>
  <text start="763.49" dur="4.44">Federal Reserve in any event one thing</text>
  <text start="766.37" dur="3.99">that should be clear is that the Fed</text>
  <text start="767.93" dur="6.27">hasn&amp;#39;t used its existing powers either</text>
  <text start="770.36" dur="7.77">wisely or effectively or for the people</text>
  <text start="774.2" dur="7.02">of the United States why because the</text>
  <text start="778.13" dur="7.29">Federal Reserve they do not report to</text>
  <text start="781.22" dur="7.44">any government to any people they are a</text>
  <text start="785.42" dur="8.64">corporation outside of the system</text>
  <text start="788.66" dur="8.54">outside of the laws and they only report</text>
  <text start="794.06" dur="8.1">to themselves or to the Rothschilds and</text>
  <text start="797.2" dur="6.37">they use debt to control countries to</text>
  <text start="802.16" dur="5.669">control the people</text>
  <text start="803.57" dur="7.32">and now the narrative is shifting people</text>
  <text start="807.829" dur="5.491">are asking questions do we really need</text>
  <text start="810.89" dur="5.31">the Fed look what they&amp;#39;ve done in the</text>

  <text start="819.829" dur="4.801">behind and when the system comes down</text>
  <text start="823.01" dur="6.329">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the central bank</text>
