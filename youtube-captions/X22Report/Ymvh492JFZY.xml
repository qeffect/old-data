  <text start="43.379" dur="4.53">back in history for a second and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="45.33" dur="5.189">just go back prior to 2008 and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.909" dur="5.58">hear what the government officials told</text>
  <text start="50.519" dur="5.371">us and the Fed officials told us they</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="5.161">were telling us that the subprime was</text>
  <text start="55.89" dur="4.559">contained housing might dip a little bit</text>
  <text start="58.65" dur="5.04">but they&amp;#39;ve never seen housing prices</text>
  <text start="60.449" dur="5.131">really crash at all they&amp;#39;ve also told us</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="4.35">that they warned forecasting any type of</text>
  <text start="65.58" dur="5.52">recession in the near future and then</text>
  <text start="68.04" dur="4.56">after the crash of 2008 they said they</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="3.72">weren&amp;#39;t going to monetize the debt</text>
  <text start="72.6" dur="5.04">pretty much everything they said what</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="4.92">turned out to be a complete lie the</text>
  <text start="77.64" dur="4.92">opposite of what they were telling us</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="4.919">fast forward to today what are they</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="4.949">throwing at us they are throwing at us</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="5.731">unemployment numbers that completely do</text>
  <text start="87.509" dur="5.661">not make any sense whatsoever they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="4.649">match up to all the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="93.17" dur="4.629">everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing from</text>
  <text start="95.039" dur="5.131">housing to retail and unemployment it</text>
  <text start="97.799" dur="4.11">doesn&amp;#39;t match it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="3.6">whatsoever but they&amp;#39;re keeping the</text>
  <text start="101.909" dur="5.82">illusion alive and this is their job</text>
  <text start="103.77" dur="6.18">because their whole agenda is not to</text>
  <text start="107.729" dur="6.691">help the American people their whole</text>
  <text start="109.95" dur="7.349">agenda is to help themselves and to keep</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="5.519">their system alive so they can</text>
  <text start="117.299" dur="5.25">continually make more and more money and</text>
  <text start="119.939" dur="4.92">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing and we</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="4.441">look round the world and we can see how</text>
  <text start="124.859" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;re pushing this all over the place</text>
  <text start="126.99" dur="3.21">they are in the Middle East I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="128.85" dur="3.45">about the United States central bankers</text>
  <text start="130.2" dur="4.05">they are in the Middle East they are now</text>
  <text start="132.3" dur="5.43">in central Africa and they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="134.25" dur="6.09">more troops into central Africa they are</text>
  <text start="137.73" dur="3.12">in Ukraine and every place they&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="140.34" dur="3.72">to</text>
  <text start="140.85" dur="5.79">it is a complete disaster and has not</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="4.68">worked out for the people actually most</text>
  <text start="146.64" dur="4.86">of the people in these countries have it</text>
  <text start="148.74" dur="5.07">worse off at this time they completely</text>
  <text start="151.5" dur="5.4">put the countries into debt they robbed</text>
  <text start="153.81" dur="8.52">them all the natural resources and they</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="8.67">keep the country militarily enslaved to</text>
  <text start="162.33" dur="5.55">a private western central bank and they</text>
  <text start="165.57" dur="4.92">put all their natural resources on the</text>
  <text start="167.88" dur="4.26">US dollar and all they continually do is</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="4.31">throw more and more debt onto these</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="5.19">country now even those countries that</text>
  <text start="174.8" dur="4.66">weren&amp;#39;t militarily taken over are</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="4.29">treated the same way let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="179.46" dur="4.89">Greece let&amp;#39;s look at site but it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="5.04">a look at France look at Spain more and</text>
  <text start="184.35" dur="4.44">more debt is thrown onto these countries</text>
  <text start="186.66" dur="4.68">the government&amp;#39;s have to turn around and</text>
  <text start="188.79" dur="4.68">put more austerity on the people it</text>
  <text start="191.34" dur="5.79">makes it harder for the people the</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="6.21">people suffer but guess what this does</text>
  <text start="197.13" dur="5.64">not help anything it makes it worse and</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="5.94">as time goes on each one of these</text>
  <text start="202.77" dur="5.31">countries continually decline they act</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="5.19">they rack up more and more debt that</text>
  <text start="208.08" dur="5.1">people suffer and it will not get better</text>
  <text start="210.81" dur="4.68">and all we see is unemployment going up</text>
  <text start="213.18" dur="4.62">and we look here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="215.49" dur="4.53">see the same exact thing happening the</text>
  <text start="217.8" dur="3.84">only thing the only difference is that</text>
  <text start="220.02" dur="5.88">the United States has the ability to</text>
  <text start="221.64" dur="8.55">print money has the ability to overtake</text>
  <text start="225.9" dur="6.93">and a switch governments in other</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="4.56">countries to put their resources on the</text>
  <text start="232.83" dur="4.5">US dollar to keep that propped up here</text>
  <text start="234.75" dur="4.98">in the United States and we are seeing</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="4.83">that the people in the United States are</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="4.17">not better off for this actually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="242.16" dur="3.9">starting to get worse now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="3.93">seeing this every single day we look at</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="3.33">the retail market we look at the housing</text>
  <text start="247.83" dur="4.71">market we look at the real unemployment</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="6.11">figures we can see that this whole</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="7.29">entire situation this economic</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="6.67">catastrophe is absolutely getting worse</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="5.79">it is not getting better and this is a</text>
  <text start="262.17" dur="5.91">slow decline into an economic collapse</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="5.34">and this is what we are following we are</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="5.7">tracking this every single day and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="4.04">watching all the signs and indicators to</text>
  <text start="273.78" dur="3.77">let us know that</text>
  <text start="275" dur="5.28">this economy is completely declining and</text>
  <text start="277.55" dur="5.04">soon it will end up in a collapse it</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="5.25">happened during the Great Depression it</text>
  <text start="282.59" dur="6.3">happened in 2008 they pumped it up and</text>
  <text start="285.53" dur="6.81">here we are again we are headed for a</text>
  <text start="288.89" dur="6.03">major major collapse and you can argue</text>
  <text start="292.34" dur="7.53">that it&amp;#39;s not going to happen that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.92" dur="7.7">it the White House and the Fed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.87" dur="6.42">going to fix it all you can live in this</text>
  <text start="302.62" dur="5.98">illusion that is fine people did this</text>
  <text start="306.29" dur="3.93">back in two thousand eight people lived</text>
  <text start="308.6" dur="3.39">in the illusion that housing was going</text>
  <text start="310.22" dur="4.47">to continually go up it it will never</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="4.8">fall jobs will continually get better</text>
  <text start="314.69" dur="4.56">and better and people will continually</text>
  <text start="316.79" dur="4.74">make more money and those people who</text>
  <text start="319.25" dur="5.7">stayed in that illusion pretty much lost</text>
  <text start="321.53" dur="6.54">everything here you have the chance of</text>
  <text start="324.95" dur="5.96">protecting yourself protecting what you</text>
  <text start="328.07" dur="6.56">have preparing for an economic collapse</text>
  <text start="330.91" dur="6.88">preparing your family instead of being</text>
  <text start="334.63" dur="6.19">surprised by a major collapse saying</text>
  <text start="337.79" dur="6.42">what just happened we are doing this</text>
  <text start="340.82" dur="6.24">every single day to make everyone</text>
  <text start="344.21" dur="5.61">understand how this all fits in together</text>
  <text start="347.06" dur="5.7">and what the central bankers US</text>
  <text start="349.82" dur="6.57">government plans are let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="352.76" dur="6.659">economic lapse news now out in Cyprus we</text>
  <text start="356.39" dur="6.12">understand they had ballads and bailouts</text>
  <text start="359.419" dur="4.861">and capital controls and what what</text>
  <text start="362.51" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.28" dur="5.07">holding meetings and they&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="366.44" dur="6.12">all these bad loans the rising</text>
  <text start="369.35" dur="5.37">unemployment and an economy that is not</text>
  <text start="372.56" dur="4.65">going anywhere and these meetings are</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="5.16">taking place to try to restart the</text>
  <text start="377.21" dur="5.13">economy because of all these bail ins</text>
  <text start="379.88" dur="4.83">and bailouts it&amp;#39;s going nowhere it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.34" dur="3.84">actually going the way Greece has gone</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="4.56">and it&amp;#39;s getting more and more difficult</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="5.37">in Cyprus people still can&amp;#39;t transfer</text>
  <text start="389.27" dur="5.55">their money out of the country or take</text>
  <text start="391.55" dur="5.67">all of their money at this time so what</text>
  <text start="394.82" dur="6.599">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now in Cyprus is that</text>
  <text start="397.22" dur="6.42">things are getting much worse it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.419" dur="4.291">getting harder for the people the people</text>
  <text start="403.64" dur="4.23">are suffering the people in Greece are</text>
  <text start="405.71" dur="6.42">suffering the people in France Spain</text>
  <text start="407.87" dur="8.37">Italy everyone has had enough of what is</text>
  <text start="412.13" dur="6.03">going on here now here in the United</text>
  <text start="416.24" dur="5.19">States what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is that</text>
  <text start="418.16" dur="5.04">nonfarm productivity fell most in a year</text>
  <text start="421.43" dur="3.93">at one point seven percent in the first</text>
  <text start="423.2" dur="4.26">quarter notably worse than that</text>
  <text start="425.36" dur="5.91">one-point-two percent drop that was</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="6.6">expected so we can see Q that the first</text>
  <text start="431.27" dur="4.68">quarter of this year is really a lot</text>
  <text start="434.06" dur="3.93">worse than they&amp;#39;re even telling us of</text>
  <text start="435.95" dur="3.899">course they&amp;#39;re blaming this all on the</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="4.29">weather and that&amp;#39;s what we should be</text>
  <text start="439.849" dur="6.601">looking at but like I said in my report</text>
  <text start="442.28" dur="6.63">yesterday the spending the spending that</text>
  <text start="446.45" dur="5.79">people are doing is exactly consistent</text>
  <text start="448.91" dur="5.52">month-on-month from january to april so</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="3.81">it doesn&amp;#39;t look like the weather really</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="3.739">kept them inside and kept them from</text>
  <text start="456.05" dur="4.47">spending their money they are actually</text>
  <text start="458.169" dur="4.06">keeping their money at this time and</text>
  <text start="460.52" dur="3.6">most of the people their credit is</text>
  <text start="462.229" dur="3.781">probably maxed out at this point and</text>
  <text start="464.12" dur="4.35">they can&amp;#39;t get more credit cards so</text>
  <text start="466.01" dur="5.339">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of this credit</text>
  <text start="468.47" dur="4.259">spending pretty much died down now of</text>
  <text start="471.349" dur="4.081">course in the corporate news they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.729" dur="5.071">telling us o credit it&amp;#39;s increasing yeah</text>
  <text start="475.43" dur="4.26">this is car loans and student loans</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re giving out car loans to the</text>
  <text start="479.69" dur="5.34">subprime people they&amp;#39;re pumping this up</text>
  <text start="482.21" dur="5.28">in that way but if we look at the jobs</text>
  <text start="485.03" dur="4.65">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that Amazon I remember</text>
  <text start="487.49" dur="4.95">way back before the Christmas season</text>
  <text start="489.68" dur="4.979">Amazon was going to hire 70,000 just</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="4.409">thousands upon thousands of people and</text>
  <text start="494.659" dur="5.94">what really happened is they&amp;#39;ve created</text>
  <text start="496.849" dur="6.181">this working poor where they can barely</text>
  <text start="500.599" dur="5.041">make any money working for Amazon in the</text>
  <text start="503.03" dur="4.83">warehouses where they can really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="505.64" dur="4.26">sustain their living but they do have a</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="3.989">job but they can&amp;#39;t get out of the</text>
  <text start="509.9" dur="3.809">shelters they can&amp;#39;t really rent the</text>
  <text start="511.849" dur="3.721">place and it&amp;#39;s making it very difficult</text>
  <text start="513.709" dur="4.471">for them and all these jobs that they</text>
  <text start="515.57" dur="5.399">hired after the season was over they let</text>
  <text start="518.18" dur="4.529">them go they didn&amp;#39;t keep them and if we</text>
  <text start="520.969" dur="5.151">look at some of the stories like Andrew</text>
  <text start="522.709" dur="6.511">Cummins 43 working north of chattanooga</text>
  <text start="526.12" dur="5.469">at an amazon warehouse in jeffersonville</text>
  <text start="529.22" dur="4.5">indiana he worked here for three months</text>
  <text start="531.589" dur="4.351">he stowed away his clothes working 40</text>
  <text start="533.72" dur="5.04">hours a week at ten dollars an hour and</text>
  <text start="535.94" dur="5.97">then all of a sudden his job was done</text>
  <text start="538.76" dur="4.74">these are part-time short-lived jobs</text>
  <text start="541.91" dur="3.27">and of course it was out in the</text>
  <text start="543.5" dur="3.96">corporate media telling everyone that</text>
  <text start="545.18" dur="4.35">yes these are all permanent they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.46" dur="4.53">hiring they&amp;#39;re hiring but after the</text>
  <text start="549.53" dur="5.31">season was over we see them removing</text>
  <text start="551.99" dur="5.43">people and they&amp;#39;re not hiring them back</text>
  <text start="554.84" dur="4.89">at this time and this report went on to</text>
  <text start="557.42" dur="4.95">say they had this big hype that they</text>
  <text start="559.73" dur="5.04">were going to hire on and stuff and that</text>
  <text start="562.37" dur="4.53">didn&amp;#39;t happen they just worked you until</text>
  <text start="564.77" dur="5.46">the time was up and then it let everyone</text>
  <text start="566.9" dur="5.9">go he says so we can see what happened</text>
  <text start="570.23" dur="4.77">during this time period that the</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="3.43">corporate media likes to put out there</text>
  <text start="575" dur="4.02">especially during the holiday season</text>
  <text start="576.23" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re you know oh my god jobs ticking up</text>
  <text start="579.02" dur="4.14">on yeah they&amp;#39;re all part-time temporary</text>
  <text start="581" dur="4.62">jobs but when they&amp;#39;re over there over</text>
  <text start="583.16" dur="5.25">and here we are coming into the summer</text>
  <text start="585.62" dur="5.94">months and this is a very rough time for</text>
  <text start="588.41" dur="5.85">retail and for people hiring because</text>
  <text start="591.56" dur="7.83">they do very little bit of hiring during</text>
  <text start="594.26" dur="8.19">the summer months now if we look at what</text>
  <text start="599.39" dur="5.85">is happening in the housing market I</text>
  <text start="602.45" dur="5.22">mean we discuss this over and over but</text>
  <text start="605.24" dur="6.3">when you really look at this housing is</text>
  <text start="607.67" dur="6.24">really in bad shape mortgage loan</text>
  <text start="611.54" dur="5.52">applications and origination volumes are</text>
  <text start="613.91" dur="5.61">continually falling large banks are</text>
  <text start="617.06" dur="5.67">paying the price of this slow down their</text>
  <text start="619.52" dur="7.83">profits are way way down the overall</text>
  <text start="622.73" dur="7.65">volume of new mortgages fell 23% to 226</text>
  <text start="627.35" dur="5.01">billion in the first quarter from 293</text>
  <text start="630.38" dur="3.57">billion in the fourth quarter last year</text>
  <text start="632.36" dur="4.11">according to the Mortgage Bankers</text>
  <text start="633.95" dur="5.97">Association total mortgage origination</text>
  <text start="636.47" dur="6.06">among the ten largest banks dropped more</text>
  <text start="639.92" dur="5.04">significantly by twenty seven point five</text>
  <text start="642.53" dur="5.01">percent from the previous quarter to</text>
  <text start="644.96" dur="4.83">eighty eight point eight billion and by</text>
  <text start="647.54" dur="6.15">sixty six point seven percent from the</text>
  <text start="649.79" dur="7.56">1st quarter of 2013 so if we go back one</text>
  <text start="653.69" dur="8.81">year refinancing mortgage originations</text>
  <text start="657.35" dur="9">are down sixty six point seven percent</text>
  <text start="662.5" dur="5.53">this is not going well now this is the</text>

  <text start="1495.2" dur="5.25">they could have gone all out with World</text>

  <text start="1505.22" dur="4.56">American but I&amp;#39;m looking at the facts</text>
  <text start="1507.44" dur="4.71">and their actions not what these people</text>
  <text start="1509.78" dur="5.129">are saying because it&amp;#39;s a lot of lip</text>
  <text start="1512.15" dur="5.22">service here I&amp;#39;m looking at actually</text>
  <text start="1514.909" dur="5.431">what they have done and their actions</text>
  <text start="1517.37" dur="6.059">and the actions speak a lot louder than</text>
  <text start="1520.34" dur="6.15">what they are saying now it looks like</text>
  <text start="1523.429" dur="5.791">the anti-terrorism forces are continuing</text>
  <text start="1526.49" dur="5.25">with their agenda they&amp;#39;re not slowing</text>
  <text start="1529.22" dur="4.02">down and there&amp;#39;s about four thousand</text>
  <text start="1531.74" dur="3.33">combatants supporting the Kiev</text>
  <text start="1533.24" dur="5.34">authorities have been brought in to</text>
  <text start="1535.07" dur="6.03">Odessa reports that are militants of the</text>
  <text start="1538.58" dur="5.13">right sector fighters of the Kiev one</text>
  <text start="1541.1" dur="5.37">special task force battalions and ultras</text>
  <text start="1543.71" dur="4.65">of the SC the NIP pro have been brought</text>
  <text start="1546.47" dur="3.51">into the city and the overall number of</text>
  <text start="1548.36" dur="4.59">the commands propping up the Kiev regime</text>
  <text start="1549.98" dur="4.71">exceeds around 4,000 right now the most</text>
  <text start="1552.95" dur="3.93">dangerous thing is that the local police</text>
  <text start="1554.69" dur="4.65">have handed them the list of the pro</text>
  <text start="1556.88" dur="4.62">Federation movement activists he said in</text>
  <text start="1559.34" dur="3.9">addition we have the information the</text>
  <text start="1561.5" dur="4.679">whole city is blocked by checkpoints</text>
  <text start="1563.24" dur="5.669">traffic inside is practically paralyzed</text>
  <text start="1566.179" dur="5.851">at this time and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1568.909" dur="5.76">about this when i saw this is that the</text>
  <text start="1572.03" dur="4.74">local police handed them the list of the</text>
  <text start="1574.669" dur="3.681">activists and I&amp;#39;ve been saying this</text>
  <text start="1576.77" dur="5.399">quite often here in the united states</text>
  <text start="1578.35" dur="5.23">where DHS has infiltrated the local</text>
  <text start="1582.169" dur="5.071">authorities where they all have to come</text>
  <text start="1583.58" dur="6.66">into compliance right now DHS is dormant</text>
  <text start="1587.24" dur="7.14">because they are really put into place</text>
  <text start="1590.24" dur="5.64">for the domestic terrorist controlling</text>
  <text start="1594.38" dur="3.299">the American people they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1595.88" dur="3.029">interested in the other terrorists</text>
  <text start="1597.679" dur="3.901">because pretty much those are all</text>
  <text start="1598.909" dur="5.851">planned by the FBI CIA and the</text>
  <text start="1601.58" dur="5.849">government so they are dormant right now</text>
  <text start="1604.76" dur="4.89">waiting to be activated when the time</text>
  <text start="1607.429" dur="3.87">comes and I&amp;#39;ve always went back to that</text>
  <text start="1609.65" dur="3.899">they&amp;#39;ve been creating social profile</text>
  <text start="1611.299" dur="5.311">on every single person and creating less</text>
  <text start="1613.549" dur="5.431">and the local authorities will then take</text>
  <text start="1616.61" dur="5.039">those lists and go after those people</text>
  <text start="1618.98" dur="5.549">and we see the same thing happening here</text>
  <text start="1621.649" dur="5.071">in Ukraine where the local authorities</text>
  <text start="1624.529" dur="6.291">have the list of the people and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1626.72" dur="6.569">going to find those people so we can see</text>
  <text start="1630.82" dur="5.02">we can look into the future here a</text>
  <text start="1633.289" dur="4.321">little bit here and see how this is</text>
  <text start="1635.84" dur="4.23">going to proceed where they have</text>
  <text start="1637.61" dur="4.62">checkpoints where they have the list of</text>
  <text start="1640.07" dur="4.829">the people that might be a threat to the</text>
  <text start="1642.23" dur="4.86">government so we can see how this is all</text>
  <text start="1644.899" dur="4.64">playing out here of course Putin is</text>
  <text start="1647.09" dur="5.039">calling to the end of Kiev&amp;#39;s military</text>
  <text start="1649.539" dur="5.411">operations he&amp;#39;s saying let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="1652.129" dur="7.321">this he&amp;#39;s look at the postponed he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1654.95" dur="6.929">telling me the people of Donetsk to</text>
  <text start="1659.45" dur="6.959">postpone the May eleventh federalization</text>

  <text start="1666.409" dur="5.61">dialogue and what is going on here now</text>
  <text start="1668.84" dur="5.699">in Libya we understand that a new prime</text>
  <text start="1672.019" dur="6.24">minister was I don&amp;#39;t really want to call</text>
  <text start="1674.539" dur="5.911">it elected in but pretty much it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1678.259" dur="3.54">puppet regime still in place that is</text>
  <text start="1680.45" dur="3.63">controlled by the United States and</text>
  <text start="1681.799" dur="5.07">central bankers and of course the people</text>
  <text start="1684.08" dur="4.65">of Libya saying that we reject this new</text>
  <text start="1686.869" dur="4.471">prime minister we will not deal with</text>
  <text start="1688.73" dur="5.129">this Prime Minister they are branding</text>
  <text start="1691.34" dur="5.069">him illegitimate and they&amp;#39;re saying this</text>
  <text start="1693.859" dur="5.52">person is not for the people of Libya it</text>
  <text start="1696.409" dur="5.61">is for the central banks and the United</text>
  <text start="1699.379" dur="4.38">States government and Libya the people</text>
  <text start="1702.019" dur="4.38">in Libya of course they call them al</text>
  <text start="1703.759" dur="4.561">Qaeda United States central bankers call</text>
  <text start="1706.399" dur="3.51">them terrorists but is that it is the</text>
  <text start="1708.32" dur="3.87">people that are fighting back just like</text>
  <text start="1709.909" dur="4.11">in Ukraine as soon as these people</text>
  <text start="1712.19" dur="3.569">criticize the government and went</text>
  <text start="1714.019" dur="4.711">against the puppet regime they were</text>
  <text start="1715.759" dur="4.321">automatically called terrorists the same</text>
  <text start="1718.73" dur="3.539">things happening here in the Bundy ranch</text>
  <text start="1720.08" dur="3.689">as soon as the people stood up to the</text>
  <text start="1722.269" dur="4.441">government they were then called</text>
  <text start="1723.769" dur="5.37">domestic terrorists so you can see how</text>
  <text start="1726.71" dur="4.38">the government is working here now in</text>
  <text start="1729.139" dur="4.23">Syria we understand the elections are</text>
  <text start="1731.09" dur="4.38">coming up and right now about seventy</text>
  <text start="1733.369" dur="4.77">percent of Syrians do support Assad</text>
  <text start="1735.47" dur="5.73">ahead of the elections so most likely</text>
  <text start="1738.139" dur="4.831">Assad will win the elections and this is</text>
  <text start="1741.2" dur="3.51">going to be a problem with the central</text>
  <text start="1742.97" dur="2.31">bankers united states government because</text>
  <text start="1744.71" dur="2.67">there</text>
  <text start="1745.28" dur="4.56">thing is that the people do not like him</text>
  <text start="1747.38" dur="4.41">they don&amp;#39;t want him and once he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1749.84" dur="7.41">re-elected and of course Syria is</text>
  <text start="1751.79" dur="7.32">calling in China Russia Brazil Venezuela</text>
  <text start="1757.25" dur="3.48">all these countries to oversee the</text>
  <text start="1759.11" dur="4.47">elections to make sure it is done</text>
  <text start="1760.73" dur="4.83">properly and this will be a huge problem</text>
  <text start="1763.58" dur="6.48">for them to say that you know the people</text>
  <text start="1765.56" dur="5.94">are not with Assad and you can see why</text>
  <text start="1770.06" dur="2.88">the government is setting up the</text>
  <text start="1771.5" dur="4.38">opposition and calling them the</text>
  <text start="1772.94" dur="5.82">government now and giving them the</text>
  <text start="1775.88" dur="4.89">embassies and giving them a diplomatic</text>
  <text start="1778.76" dur="4.47">status at this point they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1780.77" dur="4.71">convince everyone that this is the</text>
  <text start="1783.23" dur="4.47">proper government there and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1785.48" dur="4.86">in the country they have no say in the</text>
  <text start="1787.7" dur="5.07">country and actually Assad is winning</text>
  <text start="1790.34" dur="5.7">and pushing these rebels out and this is</text>
  <text start="1792.77" dur="5.52">why I think the United States government</text>
  <text start="1796.04" dur="3.99">the central bankers are absolutely</text>
  <text start="1798.29" dur="4.47">planning something they&amp;#39;re not bringing</text>
