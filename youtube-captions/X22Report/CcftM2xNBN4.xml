  <text start="105.789" dur="4.411">thing they know how to do is well first</text>
  <text start="107.92" dur="4.02">well they know try to do two things one</text>
  <text start="110.2" dur="3.57">is propaganda in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="111.94" dur="3.569">where they make up stuff and they spread</text>
  <text start="113.77" dur="3.15">it around and hopefully everyone pays</text>
  <text start="115.509" dur="4.411">attention to that the other one is</text>
  <text start="116.92" dur="4.679">events where they create false flags to</text>
  <text start="119.92" dur="4.38">distract from what is really going on</text>
  <text start="121.599" dur="5.491">now we know that there are certain</text>
  <text start="124.3" dur="4.769">individuals in the FBI and within the</text>
  <text start="127.09" dur="5.31">Department of Justice well they are just</text>
  <text start="129.069" dur="5.091">criminals and everything that&amp;#39;s coming</text>

  <text start="148.36" dur="4.08">testifying in front of Congress and they</text>
  <text start="150.819" dur="3.691">were asking them questions but how do</text>
  <text start="152.44" dur="4.409">you ask questions if you don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="154.51" dur="4.89">meat and potatoes of the inspector</text>
  <text start="156.849" dur="5.371">general&amp;#39;s report but what we come to</text>
  <text start="159.4" dur="4.68">find out is that struck as we know was</text>
  <text start="162.22" dur="3.989">the main operative in operation</text>
  <text start="164.08" dur="4.35">crossfire hurricane and this of course</text>
  <text start="166.209" dur="6.451">this was a deep state plot to run</text>
  <text start="168.43" dur="8.61">attacks on Trump&amp;#39;s team now we know that</text>
  <text start="172.66" dur="6.45">struck was really a CIA agent he only</text>
  <text start="177.04" dur="3.479">held the ceremonial title in the bureau</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="4.95">but was really operating under the</text>
  <text start="180.519" dur="5.911">leadership of the CIA struck has been</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="4.769">covertly operating as the</text>

  <text start="237.459" dur="5.881">reference to Struck&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.079" dur="7.77">CIA post keep mine this is not an FBI</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="5.369">post at structs position at the FBI is</text>

  <text start="248.709" dur="7.77">counterintelligence division not section</text>
  <text start="251.709" dur="8.46">chief which is a CIA post so there is</text>
  <text start="256.479" dur="7.981">some type of confusion right now of what</text>
  <text start="260.169" dur="7.5">struck really a CIA agent put into the</text>
  <text start="264.46" dur="5.489">FBI to run certain operations according</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="5.041">to this document it seems that way and</text>
  <text start="269.949" dur="6.271">if this document is actually real then</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="6.51">he was a plant in the whole thing very</text>
  <text start="276.22" dur="5.819">interesting now we know that Mueller put</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="5.31">out the indictments during or right</text>
  <text start="282.039" dur="5.85">before the summit with Putin Trump and</text>
  <text start="284.53" dur="6.21">Putin and they put out this 30 page long</text>
  <text start="287.889" dur="4.861">indictment and it&amp;#39;s full of painstaking</text>
  <text start="290.74" dur="4.16">details about alleged Russian</text>
  <text start="292.75" dur="4.68">involvement but it makes numerous</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="5.38">assertions that the reader is required</text>
  <text start="297.43" dur="4.859">to accept on faith because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.28" dur="3.9">little or no evidence provided to back</text>
  <text start="302.289" dur="4.5">up the claims and the claims themselves</text>
  <text start="304.18" dur="4.59">could be false trails set up by any</text>
  <text start="306.789" dur="5.37">number of hostile intelligence services</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="6.889">to implicate Moscow now when we take a</text>
  <text start="312.159" dur="5.94">closer look at this document the</text>
  <text start="315.659" dur="3.471">indictment identifies by name and</text>
  <text start="318.099" dur="5.051">position</text>
  <text start="319.13" dur="6.09">the 12 alleged Gio GRU officers who</text>
  <text start="323.15" dur="4.56">knowingly and intentionally conspired</text>
  <text start="325.22" dur="5.07">with each other and with persons known</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="6.24">and unknown to the grand jury to</text>
  <text start="330.29" dur="9.39">basically you know to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="333.95" dur="8.03">2016 election all twelve alleged GRU</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="5.61">officers are described in detail</text>
  <text start="341.98" dur="5.44">together with the cover mechanisms they</text>
  <text start="345.29" dur="5.34">reportedly used and the targets they</text>
  <text start="347.42" dur="6.6">pursued but they are all in Russia and</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="6.39">as we know Russia will not extradite any</text>
  <text start="354.02" dur="6.15">of these individuals because it&amp;#39;s not in</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="6.21">their Constitution and there&amp;#39;s no chance</text>
  <text start="360.17" dur="4.92">that there will be any of these</text>
  <text start="363.23" dur="4.92">individuals coming to the US unless they</text>
  <text start="365.09" dur="7.47">go ahead and say I would like to do this</text>
  <text start="368.15" dur="7.65">and go to Washington and you know stand</text>
  <text start="372.56" dur="6.09">up for myself the document itself also</text>
  <text start="375.8" dur="5.25">provides no information on how the</text>
  <text start="378.65" dur="4.95">Russian officers and their positions</text>
  <text start="381.05" dur="6.18">were identified which suggests that it</text>
  <text start="383.6" dur="6.66">could have been a u.s. hack or agent in</text>
  <text start="387.23" dur="4.53">place either run by CIA or NSA they came</text>
  <text start="390.26" dur="5.67">up with the list of those individuals</text>
  <text start="391.76" dur="6.75">connected to GRU cyber operations that</text>
  <text start="395.93" dur="4.77">would be information involving sources</text>
  <text start="398.51" dur="3.69">and methods codeword protected material</text>
  <text start="400.7" dur="5.49">beyond top secret</text>
  <text start="402.2" dur="6.14">now since Mueller really had no case</text>
  <text start="406.19" dur="5.55">really didn&amp;#39;t have any information on</text>
  <text start="408.34" dur="6.61">Russian collusion or anyone accessing</text>
  <text start="411.74" dur="5.75">the elections they needed a group and</text>
  <text start="414.95" dur="5.79">they needed to come up with something of</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="5.35">plausible Russians and they used a</text>
  <text start="420.74" dur="4.56">generic list provided by either the CIA</text>
  <text start="422.84" dur="4.92">or NSA to come up with the culprits and</text>
  <text start="425.3" dur="3.99">then use those identities and the</text>
  <text start="427.76" dur="3.5">detailed information regarding them to</text>
  <text start="429.29" dur="5.34">provide credibility to their account</text>
  <text start="431.26" dur="5.44">what they did not do however is provide</text>
  <text start="434.63" dur="4.35">the actual evidence connecting the</text>
  <text start="436.7" dur="4.35">individuals to the hack interference or</text>
  <text start="438.98" dur="4.08">to connect the same to the Russian</text>
  <text start="441.05" dur="5.01">government now this is how the</text>
  <text start="443.06" dur="5.64">propaganda always works think about when</text>
  <text start="446.06" dur="5.34">we talked about Assad gassing his own</text>
  <text start="448.7" dur="4.469">people where they showed the pictures of</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="3.989">the children and the</text>
  <text start="453.169" dur="5.37">people being gassed they never made the</text>
  <text start="455.389" dur="5.851">link on how Assad did this how he did it</text>
  <text start="458.539" dur="4.68">where he did it and how he got the</text>
  <text start="461.24" dur="3.449">chemical weapons to do this they never</text>
  <text start="463.219" dur="5.66">could do that the same things happening</text>
  <text start="464.689" dur="7.021">here they they didn&amp;#39;t make any type of</text>
  <text start="468.879" dur="5.021">link to Russia they just came up with</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="6.179">names and said yes they did it and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="6.359">supposed to believe them so what is or</text>
  <text start="477.889" dur="4.951">is not contained in the document itself</text>
  <text start="480.259" dur="4.43">there is a clear misunderstanding</text>
  <text start="482.84" dur="3.629">regarding how a sophisticated</text>
  <text start="484.689" dur="4.57">intelligence organizations which</text>
  <text start="486.469" dur="5.73">certainly includes the GRU operates if</text>
  <text start="489.259" dur="5.551">there had been a large-scale you know</text>
  <text start="492.199" dur="3.511">Russian sanctioned plan to disrupt the</text>
  <text start="494.81" dur="3.59">US elections</text>
  <text start="495.71" dur="5.759">it would not be run by twelve</text>
  <text start="498.4" dur="5.289">identifiable GRU officers working with</text>
  <text start="501.469" dur="5.16">what appears to be the only limited</text>
  <text start="503.689" dur="4.681">cover and resources if Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.629" dur="4.831">objective were truly to undermine</text>
  <text start="508.37" dur="5.729">American democracy they would not be</text>
  <text start="511.46" dur="5.579">using computers connected to networks</text>
  <text start="514.099" dur="4.92">that could be penetrated to enable</text>
  <text start="517.039" dur="4.281">personal identification or discovery of</text>
  <text start="519.019" dur="5.01">the ultimate source of the activity</text>
  <text start="521.32" dur="5.17">everyone will be working in alias on</text>
  <text start="524.029" dur="4.411">standalone machines and the transmission</text>
  <text start="526.49" dur="5.159">of information would be done using</text>
  <text start="528.44" dur="5.519">cutouts to break out to break any chain</text>
  <text start="531.649" dur="4.38">of custody a cutout might consist of</text>
  <text start="533.959" dur="4.44">using thumb drives to transmit</text>
  <text start="536.029" dur="4.771">information from one computer to another</text>
  <text start="538.399" dur="4.261">there&amp;#39;d be no sending or receiving them</text>
  <text start="540.8" dur="4.729">for information by channels that would</text>
  <text start="542.66" dur="5.82">be identified by NSA or CIA and</text>
  <text start="545.529" dur="5.231">compromised so the idea that United</text>
  <text start="548.48" dur="4.859">States government identified twelve</text>
  <text start="550.76" dur="5.75">culprits who are responsible for trying</text>
  <text start="553.339" dur="6.421">to overthrow American democracy is</text>
  <text start="556.51" dur="4.75">absolutely ridiculous again it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="559.76" dur="3.24">same thing with the cyberattacks where</text>
  <text start="561.26" dur="3.21">they told us that Russia was cyber</text>
  <text start="563" dur="3.63">attacking North Korea with cyber</text>
  <text start="564.47" dur="4.26">attacking and within a couple of hours</text>
  <text start="566.63" dur="4.16">they had those individuals the same</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="6.45">thing is happening right now it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="570.79" dur="7.409">propaganda now we know that Putin</text>
  <text start="575.18" dur="6.96">dropped a bombshell and he was naming</text>
  <text start="578.199" dur="7.181">William Browder he was also saying that</text>
  <text start="582.14" dur="4.65">listen those 12 individuals we will</text>
  <text start="585.38" dur="3.569">question them in Rush</text>
  <text start="586.79" dur="4.409">we will allow Mueller to come over and</text>
  <text start="588.949" dur="5.671">question them and what we would like to</text>
  <text start="591.199" dur="6.181">do is we would like to question michael</text>
  <text start="594.62" dur="6.45">mcdowell former US ambassador to russia</text>
  <text start="597.38" dur="6.06">for certain crimes and whatnot and they</text>
  <text start="601.07" dur="4.8">would like to have Russia come over to</text>
  <text start="603.44" dur="4.949">here and the us go over to Russia</text>
  <text start="605.87" dur="5.1">so they can watch the interrogation and</text>
  <text start="608.389" dur="5.94">of course Putin asked Trump for</text>
  <text start="610.97" dur="5.16">permission to do this and Trump of</text>
  <text start="614.329" dur="3.45">course wasn&amp;#39;t there gone hmm maybe that</text>
  <text start="616.13" dur="4.35">sounds like a really good idea maybe we</text>
  <text start="617.779" dur="5.521">should do this now it appears that</text>
  <text start="620.48" dur="3.539">Michael McDowell is getting nervous he</text>
  <text start="623.3" dur="2.67">tweeted out</text>
  <text start="624.019" dur="5.341">I hope the White House corrects the</text>
  <text start="625.97" dur="5.7">record and denounces in categorical</text>
  <text start="629.36" dur="5.82">terms this ridiculous request from Putin</text>
  <text start="631.67" dur="6.15">not doing so creates moral equivalency</text>
  <text start="635.18" dur="4.529">between a legitimacy u.s. indictment of</text>
  <text start="637.82" dur="3.87">Russian intelligence officers and a</text>
  <text start="639.709" dur="5.701">crazy completely fabricated story</text>
  <text start="641.69" dur="7.079">invented by Putin now when we look at</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="6.479">this we see that McDowell is very very</text>
  <text start="648.769" dur="5.101">nervous about all of this and he does</text>
  <text start="651.889" dur="4.531">not want this to happen now do I think</text>
  <text start="653.87" dur="5.459">this is going to happen absolutely not</text>
  <text start="656.42" dur="6.029">and we do get word that the US Senate in</text>
  <text start="659.329" dur="5.94">a unanimous vote opposes Russia</text>
  <text start="662.449" dur="5.13">questioning and I don&amp;#39;t think Trump is</text>
  <text start="665.269" dur="4.38">going to go ahead and allow this to</text>
  <text start="667.579" dur="4.291">happen anyhow because then it looks like</text>
  <text start="669.649" dur="4.411">he&amp;#39;s working with Putin this is real</text>
  <text start="671.87" dur="4.829">Russian collusion and they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="674.06" dur="7.259">after certain individuals the better</text>
  <text start="676.699" dur="6.33">solution would be to allow the real</text>
  <text start="681.319" dur="5.01">evidence that was gathered here in the</text>
  <text start="683.029" dur="5.61">United States and allow that evidence to</text>
  <text start="686.329" dur="4.591">be produced along with the Inspector</text>
  <text start="688.639" dur="4.38">General report about what has been going</text>
  <text start="690.92" dur="4.89">on and let other investigations and</text>
  <text start="693.019" dur="5.88">other indictments move forward without</text>
  <text start="695.81" dur="4.469">the help of Russia this way we can leave</text>
  <text start="698.899" dur="3.211">that out of the picture and I think</text>
  <text start="700.279" dur="2.25">that&amp;#39;s exactly what is happening right</text>
  <text start="702.11" dur="3.659">now</text>
  <text start="702.529" dur="5.131">and we can see at this point the deep</text>
  <text start="705.769" dur="4.531">state was very very nervous about this</text>
  <text start="707.66" dur="5.1">because they knew if this was allowed it</text>
  <text start="710.3" dur="5.159">was game over and this is why these</text>
  <text start="712.76" dur="6.96">individuals were screaming very loudly</text>
  <text start="715.459" dur="5.281">not to let this happen we see the FBI</text>
  <text start="719.72" dur="4.02">director</text>
  <text start="720.74" dur="5.86">Kristopher ray he&amp;#39;s saying that China</text>
  <text start="723.74" dur="4.54">rather than Russia is the most</text>
  <text start="726.6" dur="4.2">significant long-term threat to United</text>
  <text start="728.28" dur="5.37">States Ray said that the FBI has</text>
  <text start="730.8" dur="5.64">economic espionage investigations in all</text>
  <text start="733.65" dur="5.04">50 states that trace back to the Chinese</text>
  <text start="736.44" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s very interesting because as we</text>
  <text start="738.69" dur="4.92">know there was a server that was not</text>
  <text start="741.42" dur="6">locked down and there were certain</text>
  <text start="743.61" dur="7.17">entities taking information this was a</text>
  <text start="747.42" dur="5.01">drop site I mean back in the old day you</text>
  <text start="750.78" dur="3.87">sit at a bench you marked something with</text>
  <text start="752.43" dur="4.38">chalk on the bench you leave the item</text>
  <text start="754.65" dur="4.49">there someone would come by pick it up</text>
  <text start="756.81" dur="4.95">and they would have the information</text>
  <text start="759.14" dur="4.93">today it&amp;#39;s a lot easier you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="761.76" dur="4.11">to go out of that out of the your area</text>
  <text start="764.07" dur="5.07">you can have a server right in your home</text>
  <text start="765.87" dur="4.89">you can make sure that it doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="769.14" dur="5.31">any Crip Shin make sure it&amp;#39;s not locked</text>
  <text start="770.76" dur="7.44">down and allow other foreign entities</text>
  <text start="774.45" dur="6.87">hack into it with ease and take the</text>
  <text start="778.2" dur="5.28">information and then you can say well I</text>
  <text start="781.32" dur="3.3">didn&amp;#39;t realize this was happening it</text>
  <text start="783.48" dur="3.84">wasn&amp;#39;t my fault</text>
  <text start="784.62" dur="6.03">I wasn&amp;#39;t giving information out but in</text>
  <text start="787.32" dur="5.37">reality that person really was</text>
  <text start="790.65" dur="4.5">because they knew exactly what they were</text>
  <text start="792.69" dur="5.16">doing they knew they were leaving the</text>
  <text start="795.15" dur="4.86">server wide open they knew that other</text>
  <text start="797.85" dur="3.84">foreign entities were going to hack into</text>
  <text start="800.01" dur="3.03">it and of course they were being paid</text>
  <text start="801.69" dur="3.78">for it and you just have to do is follow</text>
  <text start="803.04" dur="4.17">the money and you can find how this was</text>
  <text start="805.47" dur="3.84">done and of course what I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="807.21" dur="5.1">about is Clinton&amp;#39;s server now remember Q</text>
  <text start="809.31" dur="6.3">says they have the server they have the</text>
  <text start="812.31" dur="7.02">information they traced everything they</text>
  <text start="815.61" dur="7.65">have it all now Trump has been telling</text>
  <text start="819.33" dur="6">us how great the summit went in Helsinki</text>
  <text start="823.26" dur="3.72">with Putin and of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="825.33" dur="2.94">media is out there saying that it was a</text>
  <text start="826.98" dur="3.66">complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="828.27" dur="5.7">and Trump tweeted that this is all fake</text>
  <text start="830.64" dur="4.949">news fake news media wants so badly to</text>
  <text start="833.97" dur="3.93">see a major confrontation with Russia</text>
  <text start="835.589" dur="4.921">even a confrontation that could lead to</text>
  <text start="837.9" dur="5.37">war they are pushing so recklessly hard</text>
  <text start="840.51" dur="7.17">and Putin actually backed up Trump</text>
  <text start="843.27" dur="6.6">saying that the sit-down was very</text>
  <text start="847.68" dur="4.409">successful</text>
  <text start="849.87" dur="4.35">they made many different agreements they</text>
  <text start="852.089" dur="4.321">didn&amp;#39;t elaborate on their agreements but</text>
  <text start="854.22" dur="3.75">they said everything went very very well</text>
  <text start="856.41" dur="3.54">and I&amp;#39;m sure it did</text>
  <text start="857.97" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s everything the deep state didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="859.95" dur="5.1">want to happen they&amp;#39;re even hinting</text>
  <text start="862.14" dur="4.29">right now of a second summit and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="865.05" dur="4.55">gonna be talking about North Korea</text>
  <text start="866.43" dur="5.46">nuclear proliferation stopping terrorism</text>
  <text start="869.6" dur="4.21">cyberattacks trade Ukraine Middle East</text>
  <text start="871.89" dur="4.139">and much much more</text>
  <text start="873.81" dur="4.02">so we see that things are definitely</text>
  <text start="876.029" dur="4.261">turning around and the deep state they</text>
  <text start="877.83" dur="4.47">do not like this whatsoever and as the</text>
  <text start="880.29" dur="4.35">deep state is continually pushed back in</text>
  <text start="882.3" dur="4.979">the corner and more truth and facts come</text>
  <text start="884.64" dur="7.13">out which implicates certain individuals</text>
  <text start="887.279" dur="7.56">like Comey struck Paige Clinton Obama</text>
  <text start="891.77" dur="5.92">Brennan and the rest they&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="894.839" dur="6.471">very very nervous and what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="897.69" dur="6.92">to do is they&amp;#39;re going to push something</text>
  <text start="901.31" dur="6.219">very large which is going to be an event</text>
  <text start="904.61" dur="6.729">now in the beginning they might have</text>
  <text start="907.529" dur="6.481">some type of news they might try to clog</text>
  <text start="911.339" dur="4.741">the news feed with something ridiculous</text>
  <text start="914.01" dur="4.019">maybe like you know stormy Daniels which</text>
  <text start="916.08" dur="3.449">they tried to do it didn&amp;#39;t work but</text>
  <text start="918.029" dur="4.201">they&amp;#39;ll try to do something even when</text>
  <text start="919.529" dur="5.461">when with the meeting with Putin they</text>
  <text start="922.23" dur="4.5">pushed out the 12 indictments to show</text>
  <text start="924.99" dur="3.66">everyone that look Russia is really</text>
  <text start="926.73" dur="3.54">responsible for this and that whole</text>
  <text start="928.65" dur="3.12">thing fell by the wayside now of course</text>
  <text start="930.27" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re still pushing it trying to</text>
  <text start="931.77" dur="4.29">convince people but they&amp;#39;re getting to</text>
  <text start="933.63" dur="5.16">the point where the news that they push</text>
  <text start="936.06" dur="4.71">out the propaganda that they push out no</text>
  <text start="938.79" dur="3.69">one&amp;#39;s really believing it anymore now to</text>
  <text start="940.77" dur="3.569">really distract from everything what are</text>
  <text start="942.48" dur="5.07">they going to have to do they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="944.339" dur="5.971">to have to create another event maybe</text>
  <text start="947.55" dur="5.67">something on the scale of 9/11 where</text>
  <text start="950.31" dur="7.05">that takes up the newsfeed for days and</text>
  <text start="953.22" dur="6.3">date actually weeks on end so what could</text>
  <text start="957.36" dur="5.34">be next well it could be a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="959.52" dur="5.25">along with physical events around the</text>
  <text start="962.7" dur="4.2">country you know it&amp;#39;s going to have to</text>
  <text start="964.77" dur="5.46">be something very very large it could be</text>
  <text start="966.9" dur="6">an economic collapse and if they blame</text>
  <text start="970.23" dur="4.859">this on Trump this would clog the news</text>
  <text start="972.9" dur="3.559">feeds people will be very angry people</text>
  <text start="975.089" dur="5.911">become very very angry and pay attention</text>
  <text start="976.459" dur="6.951">when certain things happen and it hits</text>
  <text start="981" dur="5.079">home like it hits there</text>
  <text start="983.41" dur="6.359">while at their bank account their life</text>
  <text start="986.079" dur="6.601">savings their way of life then people</text>
  <text start="989.769" dur="5.75">wake up and they pay attention and this</text>
  <text start="992.68" dur="6.329">might be something that the deep state</text>
  <text start="995.519" dur="5.8">does where they along with the central</text>
  <text start="999.009" dur="3.661">bank they bring down the economy because</text>
  <text start="1001.319" dur="2.58">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been hearing and</text>
  <text start="1002.67" dur="4.589">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been showing is</text>
  <text start="1003.899" dur="5.49">that they have already put everything in</text>
  <text start="1007.259" dur="4.591">motion where they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="1009.389" dur="5.13">bring down the system and if they can do</text>
  <text start="1011.85" dur="5.07">this this would clog the news feed and</text>
  <text start="1014.519" dur="4.531">people would be very very angry now if</text>
  <text start="1016.92" dur="4.05">they can control the narrative and blame</text>
  <text start="1019.05" dur="4.2">this on all the policies of Trump then</text>
  <text start="1020.97" dur="4.38">guess what happens people become angry</text>
  <text start="1023.25" dur="3.48">and I think this might be where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1025.35" dur="4.05">headed now they could try anything else</text>
  <text start="1026.73" dur="4.62">and they probably will but we can see</text>
  <text start="1029.4" dur="3.419">that they&amp;#39;re going to move in a</text>
  <text start="1031.35" dur="5.52">direction where they&amp;#39;ll have no choice</text>
  <text start="1032.819" dur="6.031">but to have a major major event now we</text>
  <text start="1036.87" dur="4.89">see that turkey they&amp;#39;ve lifted their</text>
  <text start="1038.85" dur="4.589">two-year long state of emergency turkey</text>
  <text start="1041.76" dur="4.14">has lifted the state of emergency at</text>
  <text start="1043.439" dur="4.681">1:00 a.m. local time that has been</text>
  <text start="1045.9" dur="5.07">placed for two years since the 2016</text>
  <text start="1048.12" dur="5.309">failed coup and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1050.97" dur="5.579">that is over and done with we see out in</text>
  <text start="1053.429" dur="5.461">Iraq the Iraqi army and the Kurdish army</text>
  <text start="1056.549" dur="4.531">they have joined forces they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1058.89" dur="4.2">after the Islamic state now and they are</text>
  <text start="1061.08" dur="5.79">destroying the Islamic state we see</text>
  <text start="1063.09" dur="7.5">serious Assad they are set to recover</text>
  <text start="1066.87" dur="6.03">the Golan frontier and what is happening</text>
  <text start="1070.59" dur="4.199">here is the moderate rebels the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1072.9" dur="3.48">state al Qaeda al nusra and the rest of</text>
  <text start="1074.789" dur="4.321">the terrorist groups they are</text>
  <text start="1076.38" dur="5.1">surrendering or fleeing and it looks</text>
  <text start="1079.11" dur="5.46">like Assad&amp;#39;s forces are moving closer</text>
  <text start="1081.48" dur="5.51">and closer to the border of Israel in</text>
  <text start="1084.57" dur="4.92">the Golan Heights they have the border</text>
  <text start="1086.99" dur="5.11">controlled with Jordan they have the</text>
  <text start="1089.49" dur="7.02">border controlled with Iraq and it looks</text>
  <text start="1092.1" dur="8.01">like the Syrian Armed Forces the Russian</text>
  <text start="1096.51" dur="7.02">forces they have almost full control of</text>
  <text start="1100.11" dur="6.689">the country and time is now ticking down</text>
  <text start="1103.53" dur="4.92">where the US troops and the coalition</text>
  <text start="1106.799" dur="4.051">forces they&amp;#39;re going to have to do</text>
  <text start="1108.45" dur="4.83">something and I think it&amp;#39;s almost time</text>
  <text start="1110.85" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re going to see an announcement that</text>
  <text start="1113.28" dur="3.239">the Iranian advisers are no longer</text>
  <text start="1115.71" dur="3.24">needed in</text>
  <text start="1116.519" dur="5.19">Syria and we&amp;#39;re going to see the US</text>
  <text start="1118.95" dur="6.87">troops the coalition forces be removed</text>
  <text start="1121.709" dur="8.07">from Syria and this will really hit the</text>
  <text start="1125.82" dur="6.63">deep state hard because as we know their</text>
  <text start="1129.779" dur="6.57">entire mission was to control the Middle</text>
  <text start="1132.45" dur="5.219">East with a regime change in puppet</text>
  <text start="1136.349" dur="4.26">governments in all these different</text>
  <text start="1137.669" dur="5.25">countries once they lose this think</text>
  <text start="1140.609" dur="4.95">about what happens here they lose Iraq</text>
  <text start="1142.919" dur="5.49">they lose Lebanon they lose Libya they</text>
  <text start="1145.559" dur="6.03">lose Sudan they lose Afghanistan they</text>
  <text start="1148.409" dur="5.22">lose Syria it&amp;#39;s game over the petro</text>
  <text start="1151.589" dur="4.17">dollar system will no longer be</text>
  <text start="1153.629" dur="4.05">supported in these countries these</text>
  <text start="1155.759" dur="3.931">countries are going to turn to other</text>
  <text start="1157.679" dur="5.91">currencies this is what they were doing</text>
  <text start="1159.69" dur="7.529">prior to all the invasions going back</text>
  <text start="1163.589" dur="5.79">many many years and now we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="1167.219" dur="4.89">point in time where it&amp;#39;s all falling</text>
  <text start="1169.379" dur="6.18">apart this can no longer be propped up</text>
  <text start="1172.109" dur="5.88">the system must come down and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1175.559" dur="4.74">to come down because as we can see the</text>
  <text start="1177.989" dur="3.84">central bank forces they are preparing</text>
  <text start="1180.299" dur="3.93">their narrative they&amp;#39;re pushing the</text>
  <text start="1181.829" dur="4.621">economy to crash because they know they</text>
  <text start="1184.229" dur="4.02">have no alternative but that push it to</text>
  <text start="1186.45" dur="3.779">crash because if they allow it to crash</text>
  <text start="1188.249" dur="3.24">on its own they won&amp;#39;t be able to control</text>
  <text start="1190.229" dur="3.03">the narrative we have Trump in the</text>
  <text start="1191.489" dur="3.18">Patriots on the other side where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1193.259" dur="3.96">trying to control the narrative and then</text>
  <text start="1194.669" dur="5.521">we have the deep state the deep state</text>
  <text start="1197.219" dur="4.89">well they&amp;#39;re stuck and they can either</text>
  <text start="1200.19" dur="4.019">bring down the economy or have some</text>
  <text start="1202.109" dur="4.831">other type of an event or do both at the</text>
  <text start="1204.209" dur="5.13">same time but as we can see the whole</text>
  <text start="1206.94" dur="5.279">thing&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart and even</text>
  <text start="1209.339" dur="5.01">if the central banks don&amp;#39;t bring down</text>
  <text start="1212.219" dur="4.68">the economy it&amp;#39;s going to burn and</text>
  <text start="1214.349" dur="3.721">collapse on its own because as we can</text>
  <text start="1216.899" dur="3">see out in the middle east it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1218.07" dur="3.359">completely falling apart the petro</text>
  <text start="1219.899" dur="3.541">dollar is gonna be falling apart and</text>
