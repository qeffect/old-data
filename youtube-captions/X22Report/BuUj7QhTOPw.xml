  <text start="46.05" dur="3.809">every single person they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="48.359" dur="3.391">continue to spy on the government</text>

  <text start="56.67" dur="4.95">little later in this report but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="4.86">head out to Greece and we understand</text>
  <text start="61.62" dur="4.77">that Greece is having a very tough time</text>
  <text start="63.3" dur="5.93">they have a huge amount of Tet debt and</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="5.67">we understand that the unemployment is</text>
  <text start="69.23" dur="4.99">skyrocketing youth unemployment is over</text>
  <text start="72.06" dur="4.23">fifty percent and things are just</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="3.539">getting worse and of course you know</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="5.48">Greece is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="8.371">oh we&amp;#39;re going to be coming out of this</text>
  <text start="81.77" dur="6.75">the the bailout program will probably</text>
  <text start="86.13" dur="5.34">come out of this by next year and</text>
  <text start="88.52" dur="6.129">antonius summer US has been saying this</text>
  <text start="91.47" dur="6.329">and but if you really look of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="94.649" dur="5.641">happening here he says they have a</text>
  <text start="97.799" dur="6.75">surplus of a hundred eight hundred</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="7.92">million euros and this is not going to</text>
  <text start="104.549" dur="6.96">help them get out of the bailout program</text>
  <text start="108.21" dur="8.25">because the total payments due in 2014</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="6.991">are thirty 1.6 billion euros and the</text>
  <text start="116.46" dur="7.049">total lund phones available to meet that</text>

  <text start="126" dur="6.3">surplus doesn&amp;#39;t even make a dent at all</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="4.44">so what he&amp;#39;s saying he&amp;#39;s in a dream</text>
  <text start="132.3" dur="3.96">world right now just like every other</text>

  <text start="136.26" dur="4.57">people giving them hope that yes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.42" dur="4.24">almost over and we&amp;#39;re coming out of this</text>
  <text start="140.83" dur="3.99">no even though we have thirty percent</text>
  <text start="142.66" dur="3.69">unemployment and you know fifty or sixty</text>
  <text start="144.82" dur="4.47">percent unemployment for the youth</text>

  <text start="162.73" dur="3.51">this year and this is what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="164.47" dur="3.96">to see happen and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="166.24" dur="3.72">and you have to think back when they</text>
  <text start="168.43" dur="3.63">first got there first bailout the news</text>
  <text start="169.96" dur="3.66">was out there saying oh look we&amp;#39;ve taken</text>
  <text start="172.06" dur="3.45">care of Greece they got the bail out</text>
  <text start="173.62" dur="5.46">there on the right track that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="6.449">they&amp;#39;re fine and since that time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.08" dur="4.95">gotten worse it&amp;#39;s gotten worse they</text>
  <text start="181.959" dur="5.431">needed another bailout it&amp;#39;s got an even</text>
  <text start="184.03" dur="5.37">worse and here we are already where</text>
  <text start="187.39" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re looking to get another bailout</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="5.28">and of course it&amp;#39;s the same with every</text>
  <text start="192.43" dur="4.02">politician Greece is out there saying</text>
  <text start="194.68" dur="4.16">that we&amp;#39;re you know we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="196.45" dur="4.59">leaving the bailout process the</text>
  <text start="198.84" dur="5.11">president of France is out there saying</text>
  <text start="201.04" dur="4.83">that we&amp;#39;re in this recovery eurozone is</text>
  <text start="203.95" dur="3.42">out there saying we&amp;#39;re recovering the</text>
  <text start="205.87" dur="4.83">United States is saying we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="207.37" dur="5.64">great recovery and everything that you</text>
  <text start="210.7" dur="4.98">look at is completely the opposite of</text>
  <text start="213.01" dur="6.09">what they&amp;#39;re saying now let&amp;#39;s take a</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="6.089">look here in United States we see that</text>
  <text start="219.1" dur="4.77">retail sales are declining we saw a UPS</text>
  <text start="221.769" dur="5.611">saying they miss their expectation</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="5.31">housing is declining things are not</text>
  <text start="227.38" dur="3.96">going well people are feeling it</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="4.32">yesterday I reported on a gallup poll</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="5.25">and the question was you know are you</text>
  <text start="233.5" dur="5.04">doing better now compared to last year</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="4.92">and forty two percent say they are doing</text>
  <text start="238.54" dur="5.78">worse now than they were last year and</text>
  <text start="241.51" dur="6.449">we see right now consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="244.32" dur="6.55">missed by most in eight years people are</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="5.221">actually starting to feel it things</text>
  <text start="250.87" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t make sense the calculations and</text>
  <text start="253.18" dur="4.739">the statistical numbers coming from the</text>
  <text start="255.55" dur="5.57">government do not make sense to people</text>
  <text start="257.919" dur="6.121">six point seven percent how could retail</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="4.99">be worse off than last year when it was</text>
  <text start="264.04" dur="5.73">seven point eight percent makes no sense</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="7.459">how could housing be in a decline when</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="7.099">more people have work makes no sense</text>
  <text start="273.569" dur="5.37">people are actually feeling it and of</text>
  <text start="276.869" dur="3.961">course the government says oh my god our</text>
  <text start="278.939" dur="4.801">numbers aren&amp;#39;t making sense anymore and</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="5.039">people are catching on and what we need</text>
  <text start="283.74" dur="4.53">to do right now is make sure that people</text>
  <text start="285.869" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t see what is happening will change</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="4.139">unemployment which they have they change</text>
  <text start="290.339" dur="3.961">gdp which they have and now of course</text>
  <text start="292.409" dur="3.15">yesterday I said they changed inflation</text>
  <text start="294.3" dur="3.69">and how they&amp;#39;re going to calculate it</text>
  <text start="295.559" dur="4.021">and they&amp;#39;re going to make inflation look</text>
  <text start="297.99" dur="3.899">like there are there is no inflation but</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="4.709">if you go to the supermarket or you buy</text>
  <text start="301.889" dur="5.28">fuel you will see that prices are</text>
  <text start="304.289" dur="5.28">continually getting higher and I do</text>
  <text start="307.169" dur="4.71">track the products on the site and I</text>
  <text start="309.569" dur="3.57">noticed that milk at one store I go to</text>
  <text start="311.879" dur="2.4">and yes you can go to many different</text>
  <text start="313.139" dur="3.48">stores and they have all different</text>
  <text start="314.279" dur="4.68">prices but I go to the one store and the</text>
  <text start="316.619" dur="5.55">milk right there is at four dollars and</text>
  <text start="318.959" dur="5.341">nine cents and if you look at other</text>
  <text start="322.169" dur="4.8">products products have actually you know</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re there they were reduced in size</text>
  <text start="326.969" dur="4.68">but they keep the price the same they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.55" dur="4.769">tricking everyone to make everyone</text>
  <text start="331.649" dur="4.35">believe there is no inflation but if you</text>
  <text start="334.319" dur="4.08">really look and you go shopping your</text>
  <text start="335.999" dur="3.96">food bill continually Rises and I hate</text>
  <text start="338.399" dur="6.81">to say it most of the people out there</text>
  <text start="339.959" dur="7.77">are buying fuel and buying food I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="345.209" dur="5.43">sorry but you know housekeeping</text>
  <text start="347.729" dur="7.05">financial advice in inflation the</text>
  <text start="350.639" dur="6.75">calculation makes no sense to me okay</text>
  <text start="354.779" dur="5.43">now we understand that the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="357.389" dur="5.161">is coming and it&amp;#39;s coming in February</text>
  <text start="360.209" dur="4.591">and we all know that the government is</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="5.009">going to do one thing and one thing only</text>
  <text start="364.8" dur="4.769">because they have no choice because the</text>
  <text start="367.559" dur="5.19">revenue the tax revenue that they are</text>
  <text start="369.569" dur="6.15">bringing in cannot sustain the debt</text>
  <text start="372.749" dur="5.22">level that we have right now and all the</text>
  <text start="375.719" dur="5.55">programs they have running so they need</text>
  <text start="377.969" dur="5.34">to borrow more money to keep this system</text>
  <text start="381.269" dur="4.29">going and they will do this and</text>
  <text start="383.309" dur="5.07">continually do this until they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="385.559" dur="5.01">anymore and sooner or later just like in</text>
  <text start="388.379" dur="3.75">every household if you&amp;#39;re bringing in</text>
  <text start="390.569" dur="4.35">fifty thousand dollars a year and you</text>
  <text start="392.129" dur="4.79">have a hundred thousand dollar debt 150</text>
  <text start="394.919" dur="4.5">thousand dollars that on credit cards</text>
  <text start="396.919" dur="4.571">200,000 there comes a point where you</text>
  <text start="399.419" dur="4.5">cannot make that interest payment and</text>
  <text start="401.49" dur="4.949">all of a sudden the creditors say you</text>
  <text start="403.919" dur="2.97">know what we&amp;#39;re done here we don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="406.439" dur="2.73">can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="406.889" dur="4.83">you any more money even though the u.s.</text>
  <text start="409.169" dur="3.78">can print money people around countries</text>
  <text start="411.719" dur="3.57">around the world are going to say you</text>
  <text start="412.949" dur="4.83">know what we&amp;#39;re really losing faith in</text>
  <text start="415.289" dur="4.951">the United States here because your debt</text>
  <text start="417.779" dur="4.831">is so high you cannot come out of this</text>
  <text start="420.24" dur="8.85">and this is when the problem really</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="9.269">starts okay now Mexico is launching its</text>
  <text start="429.09" dur="5.43">first trusted traveler program open to</text>
  <text start="431.879" dur="4.59">the US citizens Mexico recently launched</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="4.649">its first trusted traveler program and</text>
  <text start="436.469" dur="4.771">the program is designed to expedite a</text>
  <text start="439.169" dur="4.59">process for US citizens to enter Mexico</text>
  <text start="441.24" dur="4.26">via major airports by providing a</text>
  <text start="443.759" dur="4.38">pre-approval process for low-risk</text>
  <text start="445.5" dur="4.55">travelers it is a program akin to the</text>
  <text start="448.139" dur="4.14">current US Customs and Border Protection</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="3.549">Global Entry programs designed to</text>

  <text start="462" dur="6.87">to do and you can you&amp;#39;ll see in a minute</text>
  <text start="463.68" dur="7.59">why this is turning into a complete</text>
  <text start="468.87" dur="4.469">tracking system of everyone that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="471.27" dur="3.6">been talking about you can pay online</text>
  <text start="473.339" dur="3.991">but you need you know you have to pay a</text>
  <text start="474.87" dur="5.759">fee of course and complete an in-person</text>
  <text start="477.33" dur="5.269">interview at a design location now the</text>
  <text start="480.629" dur="5.34">other things that you&amp;#39;ll have to provide</text>
  <text start="482.599" dur="7.6">you will have to provide a photo you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="485.969" dur="8.19">also have to take a complete biometric</text>
  <text start="490.199" dur="7.051">scan of your eyes and of your</text>
  <text start="494.159" dur="6.391">fingerprints this is how they are</text>
  <text start="497.25" dur="5.25">getting people to hand over there</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="4.229">biometrics for their eyes and their</text>
  <text start="502.5" dur="11.13">fingerprints like I said in my previous</text>
  <text start="504.779" dur="11.31">report the United the the United Arab</text>
  <text start="513.63" dur="4.589">Emirates was doing this they were using</text>
  <text start="516.089" dur="5.301">biometrics to keep track of the people</text>
  <text start="518.219" dur="5.641">the same thing is happening right now</text>
  <text start="521.39" dur="4.18">but they always do it in a way that</text>
  <text start="523.86" dur="3.86">people don&amp;#39;t realize it&amp;#39;s happening to</text>
  <text start="525.57" dur="5.91">them because this all feeds back into</text>
  <text start="527.72" dur="7.27">putting all your information and into a</text>
  <text start="531.48" dur="6">federal database to keep track of you</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="4.589">remember they&amp;#39;re starting the Real ID</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="2.88">and they&amp;#39;re trying to get all the states</text>
  <text start="539.579" dur="2.371">involved</text>
  <text start="540.36" dur="3.87">this and this will all filter into a</text>
  <text start="541.95" dur="4.86">federal database you&amp;#39;ll have your</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="4.26">license information now if you want to</text>
  <text start="546.81" dur="2.88">travel without them you know patting you</text>
  <text start="548.49" dur="3.51">down and you can get on the planes</text>
  <text start="549.69" dur="5.85">quickly all you have to do is get them</text>
  <text start="552" dur="6">given your your fingerprint and your eye</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="5.28">scan and that will go into the same</text>
  <text start="558" dur="5.55">exact database to track you this will</text>
  <text start="560.82" dur="4.709">also help in facial recognition when</text>
  <text start="563.55" dur="5.279">they&amp;#39;re tracking you all over the United</text>
  <text start="565.529" dur="5.821">States this will be used for checkpoints</text>
  <text start="568.829" dur="5.371">within the United States and it will</text>
  <text start="571.35" dur="7.049">will be used to track every single</text>
  <text start="574.2" dur="6.03">person now we understand that Obama was</text>
  <text start="578.399" dur="4.321">out there today and he was talking about</text>
  <text start="580.23" dur="5.789">the NSA spying and how they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="582.72" dur="6.75">rein it in and he was going on and on</text>
  <text start="586.019" dur="6.121">and on how great the NSA is and you know</text>
  <text start="589.47" dur="4.71">he brought up Edward Snowden and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="592.14" dur="3.75">saying you know this sensational way in</text>
  <text start="594.18" dur="4.44">which these disclosures have come out as</text>
  <text start="595.89" dur="4.259">often shed more heat than light and he</text>
  <text start="598.62" dur="3.81">was talking about Edward Snowden when he</text>
  <text start="600.149" dur="3.87">said this while revealing methods to our</text>
  <text start="602.43" dur="4.29">adversaries that could impact our</text>
  <text start="604.019" dur="5.041">operations in ways that we may not fully</text>
  <text start="606.72" dur="4.08">understand for years to come and of</text>
  <text start="609.06" dur="3.3">course this is a reference to Edward</text>
  <text start="610.8" dur="4.05">Snowden but Edward Snowden was saying</text>
  <text start="612.36" dur="4.77">listen you&amp;#39;re violating the Fourth</text>
  <text start="614.85" dur="4.62">Amendment of every single person in the</text>
  <text start="617.13" dur="4.56">United States and this isn&amp;#39;t right</text>
  <text start="619.47" dur="3.929">anyhow to stand up for the people and of</text>
  <text start="621.69" dur="3.93">course President Obama&amp;#39;s was out there</text>
  <text start="623.399" dur="3.901">and he also saying that we need the NSA</text>
  <text start="625.62" dur="3.99">program because it prevented multiple</text>
  <text start="627.3" dur="6.06">attacks and saved many innocent lives</text>
  <text start="629.61" dur="6.45">from terrorists out there but we have to</text>
  <text start="633.36" dur="5.099">remember there was a report that came</text>
  <text start="636.06" dur="4.139">out that said the investigation found</text>

  <text start="730.44" dur="6.66">opposite of what he says okay let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="733.74" dur="6.3">on here now we understand what happened</text>
  <text start="737.1" dur="6.69">in Syria we understand that the chemical</text>
  <text start="740.04" dur="5.82">weapons did not come from Assad this has</text>
  <text start="743.79" dur="4.109">been proven over and over again we</text>
  <text start="745.86" dur="3.87">understand that the government lied and</text>
  <text start="747.899" dur="6.421">again we have to go back to that</text>
  <text start="749.73" dur="7.68">incident Syrian government and Russia</text>
  <text start="754.32" dur="5.67">invited the chemical inspectors into the</text>
  <text start="757.41" dur="5.85">country a day before the attack and we</text>
  <text start="759.99" dur="4.83">have to say why would they invite the UN</text>
  <text start="763.26" dur="4.8">chemical inspectors because they were</text>
  <text start="764.82" dur="5.31">inspecting another chemical attack that</text>
  <text start="768.06" dur="4.17">happened to prove that Assad wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="770.13" dur="3.8">responsible for this they were there and</text>
  <text start="772.23" dur="4.859">then all of a sudden a chemical attack</text>
  <text start="773.93" dur="4.45">occurred and of course the president was</text>
  <text start="777.089" dur="3.48">out there saying that they crossed red</text>
  <text start="778.38" dur="5.49">line and again they couldn&amp;#39;t provide any</text>
  <text start="780.569" dur="4.95">type of proof whatsoever and the head of</text>
  <text start="783.87" dur="3.029">the UN weapons inspector said that the</text>
  <text start="785.519" dur="4.111">American case for the Syrian government</text>
  <text start="786.899" dur="5.701">firing chemical weapons was weak because</text>
  <text start="789.63" dur="6.03">the Rockets can only go two miles but</text>
  <text start="792.6" dur="6.33">government held territory is much</text>

  <text start="809.209" dur="4.711">for the device to have been fired from</text>
  <text start="811.339" dur="4.831">the Syrian government position where the</text>
  <text start="813.92" dur="5.58">Obama administration insists they</text>
  <text start="816.17" dur="6.599">originated so the government lied to us</text>
  <text start="819.5" dur="7.68">to get us into Syria and I like I said</text>
  <text start="822.769" dur="7.531">their goal has not changed their tactics</text>
  <text start="827.18" dur="4.92">will change to to reach the goal that</text>
  <text start="830.3" dur="4.58">they always want to reach they want to</text>
  <text start="832.1" dur="7.14">reach the goal of replacing Assad in</text>
  <text start="834.88" dur="6.939">government they their goal is to put the</text>
  <text start="839.24" dur="5.31">US dollar as the reserve currency into</text>
  <text start="841.819" dur="5.46">Syria and Iran and replace those</text>
  <text start="844.55" dur="6.539">governments that is the goal to keep the</text>
  <text start="847.279" dur="6.18">dollar propped up and this goes on to</text>
  <text start="851.089" dur="4.44">say that these missiles weren&amp;#39;t capable</text>
  <text start="853.459" dur="3.93">of flying six miles from the center of</text>
  <text start="855.529" dur="4.141">Syrian government controlled part of</text>
  <text start="857.389" dur="5.341">Damascus to the point of impact in the</text>
  <text start="859.67" dur="5.45">suburbs or even the 3.6 miles from the</text>
  <text start="862.73" dur="5.339">edge of government controlled ground and</text>
  <text start="865.12" dur="5.98">they are questioning the US intelligence</text>
  <text start="868.069" dur="6.39">of what they had and again the US</text>
  <text start="871.1" dur="7.71">government never gave proof of what they</text>
  <text start="874.459" dur="5.911">were talking about and the Syrian rebels</text>
  <text start="878.81" dur="6.839">most definitely have the ability to make</text>
  <text start="880.37" dur="7.5">these weapons and this is being proved</text>
  <text start="885.649" dur="5.761">over and over again and this was a</text>
  <text start="887.87" dur="7.139">failed false flag and this is why they</text>
  <text start="891.41" dur="5.909">had a back out with Russia saying listen</text>
  <text start="895.009" dur="4.861">if we just get rid of the chemical</text>
  <text start="897.319" dur="4.111">weapons it&amp;#39;s okay with Assad being in</text>
  <text start="899.87" dur="4.68">government and of course they had to go</text>
  <text start="901.43" dur="4.95">along with this but now things have</text>
  <text start="904.55" dur="4.83">changed again because remember their</text>
  <text start="906.38" dur="7.62">goal is the same it has not changed</text>
  <text start="909.38" dur="7.319">right now the US has accused the Syrian</text>
  <text start="914" dur="5.339">government of revisionism in seeking to</text>
  <text start="916.699" dur="5.64">characterize next week&amp;#39;s peace talks as</text>
  <text start="919.339" dur="6.331">aimed at tackling terrorism rather than</text>
  <text start="922.339" dur="6.12">the departure of president al-assad and</text>
  <text start="925.67" dur="4.859">what&amp;#39;s happening right now the US</text>
  <text start="928.459" dur="5.101">Secretary of State John Kerry insisted</text>
  <text start="930.529" dur="5.55">on Friday that President Assad has no</text>
  <text start="933.56" dur="5.129">place in Syria&amp;#39;s future and he said the</text>
  <text start="936.079" dur="4.381">United States had options to step up the</text>
  <text start="938.689" dur="4.501">pressure on him</text>
  <text start="940.46" dur="5.43">I believe as we begin to get into this</text>
  <text start="943.19" dur="5.16">process that it will become clear there</text>
  <text start="945.89" dur="5.43">is no political solution whatsoever if</text>
  <text start="948.35" dur="5.37">Assad is not discussing a transition and</text>
  <text start="951.32" dur="4.89">if he thinks he is going to be part of</text>
  <text start="953.72" dur="6.66">the future it is not going to happen</text>
  <text start="956.21" dur="6.75">said John Kerry we&amp;#39;re also not out of</text>
  <text start="960.38" dur="7.77">options with respect to what we may be</text>
  <text start="962.96" dur="7.23">able to increase in terms of pressure so</text>
  <text start="968.15" dur="4.26">they are starting already they waited</text>
  <text start="970.19" dur="6.15">the amount of time they needed to wait</text>
  <text start="972.41" dur="7.04">and here we are again again in my other</text>
  <text start="976.34" dur="5.88">report we saw the Syrian electronic army</text>
  <text start="979.45" dur="4.33">trying to hit Microsoft and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="982.22" dur="3.27">doing this quite a bit with the Syrian</text>
  <text start="983.78" dur="3.45">electronic army saying they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="985.49" dur="3.69">accessing the government sites and</text>
  <text start="987.23" dur="4.32">breaking in and hacking into them and</text>
  <text start="989.18" dur="4.89">the Syrian electronic army has been</text>
  <text start="991.55" dur="4.86">hacking into many other sites so we can</text>
  <text start="994.07" dur="4.74">see what they are trying to build right</text>
  <text start="996.41" dur="5.34">now and right now the united states</text>
  <text start="998.81" dur="5.04">united nations world food program said</text>
  <text start="1001.75" dur="3.63">foreign-backed militants in Syria are</text>

  <text start="1009.7" dur="6.09">building this up right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1012.25" dur="6">going to move this mission for now what</text>
  <text start="1015.79" dur="5.58">will this mission be it could very well</text>
  <text start="1018.25" dur="5.34">be an event here in the United States</text>
  <text start="1021.37" dur="4.92">because we have to go back to what</text>
  <text start="1023.59" dur="5.7">happened during that false flag with the</text>
  <text start="1026.29" dur="5.58">chemical weapons the president john</text>
  <text start="1029.29" dur="6.84">kerry the Obama administration realized</text>
  <text start="1031.87" dur="6.48">that this is not going well the UK</text>
  <text start="1036.13" dur="4.47">didn&amp;#39;t buy it the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="1038.35" dur="4.38">wasn&amp;#39;t buying it so what they did was</text>
  <text start="1040.6" dur="4.23">they pass the buck to Congress and said</text>
  <text start="1042.73" dur="4.05">listen you vote on this and then of</text>
  <text start="1044.83" dur="3.42">course it was leaked that if you know</text>
  <text start="1046.78" dur="3.96">Assad would get rid of their chemical</text>
  <text start="1048.25" dur="5.13">weapons the United States would go along</text>
  <text start="1050.74" dur="5.85">with that and that got the Congress and</text>
  <text start="1053.38" dur="6.72">Obama off the hook but we have to</text>
  <text start="1056.59" dur="7.23">remember our the submarines the troops</text>
  <text start="1060.1" dur="8.64">were all ready to go in and get the job</text>
  <text start="1063.82" dur="7.59">done of removing Assad so right now they</text>
  <text start="1068.74" dur="5.6">are preparing for something new and they</text>
  <text start="1071.41" dur="5.6">realize the American people from that in</text>
  <text start="1074.34" dur="7.41">student they are not willing to start a</text>
  <text start="1077.01" dur="7.23">war and to go into Syria when there is</text>
  <text start="1081.75" dur="5.279">some type of chemical weapon or some</text>
  <text start="1084.24" dur="5.64">type of an event on surion soil so this</text>
  <text start="1087.029" dur="5.821">actually means that something is going</text>
  <text start="1089.88" dur="5.19">to have have to happen here in the</text>
  <text start="1092.85" dur="4.47">United States to slap the American</text>
  <text start="1095.07" dur="5.219">people in their face and say listen they</text>
  <text start="1097.32" dur="5.91">just attacked us now we need to go get</text>
  <text start="1100.289" dur="4.861">them and this is how it looks like</text>
  <text start="1103.23" dur="8.46">they&amp;#39;re starting to play this out right</text>
  <text start="1105.15" dur="9.24">now now the u.s. is going into Baja rain</text>
  <text start="1111.69" dur="5.79">the US military plans to establish an</text>
  <text start="1114.39" dur="5.13">intelligence center in Baja rain because</text>
  <text start="1117.48" dur="4.11">of their dwindling presence in</text>
  <text start="1119.52" dur="4.379">Afghanistan doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re leaving</text>
  <text start="1121.59" dur="3.839">Afghanistan is that they&amp;#39;re having some</text>

  <text start="1147.149" dur="4.38">preparing because they understand that</text>
  <text start="1149.34" dur="4.02">they are losing control in the Middle</text>
  <text start="1151.529" dur="3.601">East and they are getting all their</text>

  <text start="1168.809" dur="5.641">next event and we can see how this is</text>
  <text start="1171.6" dur="6.299">actually going to play out and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1174.45" dur="6.24">going to play out well and again we have</text>

  <text start="1560.289" dur="6.48">what&amp;#39;s interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="1563.139" dur="7.41">that the attack on target what they have</text>
  <text start="1566.769" dur="6.66">uncovered is that inside the code and of</text>
  <text start="1570.549" dur="5.73">course I don&amp;#39;t know how much to believe</text>
  <text start="1573.429" dur="7.011">about this they are saying that there</text>
  <text start="1576.279" dur="8.37">are Russian symbols and Russian language</text>
  <text start="1580.44" dur="7.41">inside the malware and this goes on to</text>

  <text start="1599.889" dur="5.591">in the malware</text>
  <text start="1601.22" dur="8.189">now the reason why I say this looks like</text>
  <text start="1605.48" dur="6.36">it was planned probably by the central</text>
  <text start="1609.409" dur="7.77">bankers US government the powers that be</text>
  <text start="1611.84" dur="8.819">is because when John Kerry meant Lavrov</text>

  <text start="1620.659" dur="6.181">understood why they were trading</text>
  <text start="1623.27" dur="7.68">potatoes but if you look at this closer</text>
  <text start="1626.84" dur="5.85">it has been revealed that the virus used</text>

  <text start="1656.45" dur="6.27">kerry and lavrov trading potatoes it</text>
  <text start="1659.69" dur="8.34">seems like they know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1662.72" dur="9.72">here it seems like that something is</text>
  <text start="1668.03" dur="8.22">about to happen and they know it now</text>
  <text start="1672.44" dur="6.32">there is another report out there saying</text>
