  <text start="83.89" dur="4.62">of reports we&amp;#39;ve been talking about how</text>
  <text start="85.42" dur="5.55">the Patriots now are on the offensive</text>
  <text start="88.51" dur="4.889">they&amp;#39;re no longer defensive since the</text>
  <text start="90.97" dur="6.359">Muller report came out and certain</text>
  <text start="93.399" dur="6.621">individuals that were brought up on</text>
  <text start="97.329" dur="5.491">charges for lying or things like that</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="5.44">they are also on the offensive</text>
  <text start="102.82" dur="6.509">everything has changed right now because</text>
  <text start="105.46" dur="6.78">the threat against them is completely</text>
  <text start="109.329" dur="4.08">gone and now they can go on the</text>
  <text start="112.24" dur="2.519">offensive we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about</text>
  <text start="113.409" dur="4.53">that in just a minute but first let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="114.759" dur="5.79">start off with Assange now the gateway</text>
  <text start="117.939" dur="4.951">Punnett they&amp;#39;ve obtained exclusive</text>
  <text start="120.549" dur="4.771">testimony as well as photos from a</text>
  <text start="122.89" dur="5.789">fellow inmate of in prison WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="125.32" dur="7.08">founder Julian Assange inside London&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="128.679" dur="5.791">highest security prison now the inmate</text>
  <text start="132.4" dur="4.01">who wishes to remain anonymous sent</text>
  <text start="134.47" dur="4.98">multiple photos of a song from inside</text>
  <text start="136.41" dur="4.96">Belmarsh maximum-security prison and</text>
  <text start="139.45" dur="3.69">spoke to the gateway Punnett about the</text>
  <text start="141.37" dur="5.97">WikiLeaks founder situation using a</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="7.53">contraband phone he has inside and there</text>
  <text start="147.34" dur="5.31">are many many photos of Assange and you</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="4.53">can see this is before his health</text>
  <text start="152.65" dur="5.729">started to decline I do believe that the</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="6.06">lawyer was using his health to move him</text>
  <text start="158.379" dur="4.621">out of this area into someplace else</text>
  <text start="161.26" dur="4.71">where he&amp;#39;s a little bit more so</text>
  <text start="163" dur="6.57">and I think the lawyer at that time was</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="6.21">using this to stop Assange from being</text>
  <text start="169.57" dur="4.26">extradited to Sweden even though they</text>
  <text start="172.18" dur="3.27">can&amp;#39;t do that at this time and I think</text>
  <text start="173.83" dur="4.05">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do right now is</text>
  <text start="175.45" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re trying to protect him now like</text>
  <text start="177.88" dur="6">we said these are photos before he went</text>
  <text start="181" dur="4.92">into the hospital wing last month now</text>
  <text start="183.88" dur="4.71">from this inmate the inmate is saying</text>
  <text start="185.92" dur="5.9">that a lot of the prisoners within this</text>
  <text start="188.59" dur="5.43">prison they like Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="191.82" dur="5.53">everyone&amp;#39;s got a million questions for</text>
  <text start="194.02" dur="4.65">me said like is the Illuminati real he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.35" dur="3.66">probably heard the question a million</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="3.69">times he also noted that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="201.01" dur="4.41">media is controlled by the government</text>
  <text start="202.36" dur="6.03">and said that the Internet is one thing</text>
  <text start="205.42" dur="4.89">they can&amp;#39;t control and it sounded like a</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="3.599">little bit like Assange himself saying</text>
  <text start="210.31" dur="4.05">this but again we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="211.989" dur="4.261">confirmation who actually said this but</text>
  <text start="214.36" dur="4.32">this is something that Assange normally</text>
  <text start="216.25" dur="4.89">would say the inmate explained that</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="4.32">prison isn&amp;#39;t like the movies and he</text>
  <text start="221.14" dur="3.66">believes that Assange is safe from</text>
  <text start="223" dur="5.16">anyone who would want to harm him</text>
  <text start="224.8" dur="4.86">you can&amp;#39;t sneeze without permission the</text>
  <text start="228.16" dur="3.63">prisoner stated that Assange is still</text>
  <text start="229.66" dur="4.799">currently in the hospital wing of the</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="4.68">prison and like I said I do believe he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.459" dur="5.601">there for his safety to keep him</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="8.13">separated from the rest of the group and</text>
  <text start="240.06" dur="6.52">many times lawyers and those people that</text>
  <text start="244.6" dur="3.75">want to keep people safe they move them</text>
  <text start="246.58" dur="3.06">to the hospital wing where they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="248.35" dur="3.48">little bit safer because they have</text>
  <text start="249.64" dur="4.23">nurses and doctors and they&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="251.83" dur="4.2">the patient so it&amp;#39;s a little bit more</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="4.859">difficult to get into that area compared</text>
  <text start="256.03" dur="4.62">to the prison and I do believe that this</text>
  <text start="258.729" dur="4.261">whole thing with the number of charges</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="5.31">would you know conspiring with Chelsea</text>
  <text start="262.99" dur="6.36">Manning and working with Chelsea Manning</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="6.39">I do believe these charges that are on</text>
  <text start="269.35" dur="6.81">Assange right now these are just being</text>
  <text start="272.35" dur="5.96">used to take him out of the embassy put</text>
  <text start="276.16" dur="6.36">him into the prison keep him safe until</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="5.38">he is needed and maybe even extradited</text>
  <text start="282.52" dur="2.73">to the United States because if you</text>
  <text start="283.69" dur="3.87">notice they haven&amp;#39;t charged him with</text>
  <text start="285.25" dur="5.25">anything else and this charge is very</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="5.16">difficult to prove because Chelsea</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="4.169">Manning doesn&amp;#39;t know who she was talking</text>
  <text start="292.72" dur="3.719">to on the other hand on the other end</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="5.31">she thought she was talking to us</text>
  <text start="296.439" dur="5.391">but nobody really knows and this is</text>
  <text start="299.979" dur="5.73">going to be very very difficult to prove</text>
  <text start="301.83" dur="6.339">now Elijah Cummings and his wife they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="305.709" dur="5.1">in a little bit of hot water and it</text>
  <text start="308.169" dur="6.24">seems that the walls are closing in on</text>
  <text start="310.809" dur="5.28">them multiple charity watchdog said the</text>
  <text start="314.409" dur="3.09">previously undisclosed financial</text>
  <text start="316.089" dur="4.35">arrangements between rocky Moore</text>
  <text start="317.499" dur="6.93">Cummings charity and for-profit company</text>
  <text start="320.439" dur="6.3">raises many many red flags and what</text>
  <text start="324.429" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re saying is that a lot of this</text>
  <text start="326.739" dur="6.78">money flowed from the nonprofit into the</text>
  <text start="330.339" dur="4.771">profit which enriched her and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="333.519" dur="3.6">showing documents they&amp;#39;re shown in the</text>
  <text start="335.11" dur="5.729">showing the audit financial statements</text>
  <text start="337.119" dur="6.87">for many many years and there are major</text>
  <text start="340.839" dur="5.461">major problems now my Araki Moore</text>
  <text start="343.989" dur="5.07">Cummings charity the center for global</text>
  <text start="346.3" dur="5.909">policy solutions paid for her profit</text>
  <text start="349.059" dur="6.241">venture global policy solutions LLC over</text>
  <text start="352.209" dur="5.07">250,000 in management fees between 2013</text>
  <text start="355.3" dur="3.839">and 2015 and this is according to the</text>
  <text start="357.279" dur="4.68">audited financial statements covering</text>
  <text start="359.139" dur="4.38">those years the management fees were</text>
  <text start="361.959" dur="3.841">paid in addition to a cost-sharing</text>

  <text start="365.8" dur="5.19">share of equipment personnel and other</text>
  <text start="368.439" dur="4.47">expenditures rocky Moore Cummings</text>
  <text start="370.99" dur="3.87">charity is funded by companies with</text>
  <text start="372.909" dur="4.23">interest before her husband&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="5.099">congressional committee and this is</text>
  <text start="377.139" dur="6.65">coming out of the Washington Examiner so</text>
  <text start="379.959" dur="8.16">it looks like there&amp;#39;s a problem here and</text>
  <text start="383.789" dur="7.15">the IRS law doesn&amp;#39;t allow a charity for</text>
  <text start="388.119" dur="4.65">this purpose this isn&amp;#39;t for the public</text>
  <text start="390.939" dur="4.171">interest this is for her personal</text>
  <text start="392.769" dur="4.56">interest you can&amp;#39;t do that and that is</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="3.599">coming from Tom Anderson who is the</text>
  <text start="397.329" dur="5.4">national legal and policy Center</text>
  <text start="398.709" dur="6.54">investigator so it looks like the walls</text>
  <text start="402.729" dur="5.49">are closing in they&amp;#39;re digging up more</text>
  <text start="405.249" dur="5.07">information and they&amp;#39;re out there and</text>
  <text start="408.219" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re going to have to explain all of</text>
  <text start="410.319" dur="3.77">this they&amp;#39;re gonna have to produce</text>
  <text start="411.579" dur="4.74">records to show that this didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="414.089" dur="4.81">the way they&amp;#39;re saying it happened but</text>
  <text start="416.319" dur="4.77">they already have the audited financial</text>
  <text start="418.899" dur="4.62">statements this is going to be tough and</text>
  <text start="421.089" dur="5.01">it seems like they&amp;#39;re in a little bit of</text>
  <text start="423.519" dur="4.82">trouble Don jr. tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="426.099" dur="3.851">following I wonder why he isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="428.339" dur="4.131">investigating this</text>
  <text start="429.95" dur="5.07">Elijah Cummings wife used her charity to</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="7.95">enrich her for-profit company documents</text>
  <text start="435.02" dur="6.08">show and again why isn&amp;#39;t anyone looking</text>
  <text start="440.42" dur="4.17">at this</text>
  <text start="441.1" dur="6.73">why isn&amp;#39;t Nadler and the rest looking at</text>
  <text start="444.59" dur="7.19">this because they don&amp;#39;t want to look at</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="8.43">any of that now very interestingly</text>
  <text start="451.78" dur="5.83">Michael Flynn fired his lawyers and this</text>
  <text start="456.26" dur="2.58">is a very interesting development this</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="5.01">is coming out of the conservative tree</text>
  <text start="458.84" dur="7.32">house and it may well indicate a change</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="6.39">in Flynn&amp;#39;s strategy or even more</text>
  <text start="466.16" dur="6.78">interesting the execution of a</text>
  <text start="469.01" dur="8.31">pre-planned strategy for General Michael</text>
  <text start="472.94" dur="5.91">Flynn there is a possibility with legal</text>
  <text start="477.32" dur="2.91">distance happening as a result of</text>
  <text start="478.85" dur="5.63">Weitzman and Muller&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="480.23" dur="8.58">concluding that Flynn may be shifting to</text>
  <text start="484.48" dur="7.3">offense to separate court filings today</text>
  <text start="488.81" dur="4.77">show that General Michael Flynn has</text>
  <text start="491.78" dur="5.58">fired his legal team and retain new</text>
  <text start="493.58" dur="7.11">counsel the department justice is filing</text>
  <text start="497.36" dur="5.43">the evidentiary documents possibly jopi</text>
  <text start="500.69" dur="5.67">Anika&amp;#39;s 302 and kis lyac transcript</text>
  <text start="502.79" dur="6.39">under seal and this came from techno fog</text>
  <text start="506.36" dur="5.4">which brought this to our attention now</text>
  <text start="509.18" dur="4.71">additionally there is another motion by</text>
  <text start="511.76" dur="4.71">the Department of Justice Van grack and</text>
  <text start="513.89" dur="4.92">Jesse Liu where previous filings under</text>
  <text start="516.47" dur="5.67">seal the government is now saying can be</text>
  <text start="518.81" dur="6.99">released so this could be the scope</text>
  <text start="522.14" dur="6.69">memos provided by Rosenstein authorizing</text>
  <text start="525.8" dur="4.89">the targeting of Flynn this might be</text>
  <text start="528.83" dur="4.68">connected to Flynn strategy to stay in</text>
  <text start="530.69" dur="6.24">litigation and not drop his guilty plea</text>
  <text start="533.51" dur="5.01">to outlast Muller information has been</text>
  <text start="536.93" dur="4.68">floating around that Weitzman and mother</text>
  <text start="538.52" dur="6.56">threatened Flynn with prosecution of his</text>
  <text start="541.61" dur="8.34">son Flynn jr. to coerce a plea agreement</text>
  <text start="545.08" dur="10.45">so think about this Flynn outlasted</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="9.83">Muller and Wiseman Muller already gave</text>
  <text start="555.53" dur="5.41">his report he retired the threat is gone</text>
  <text start="559.78" dur="5.69">now</text>
  <text start="560.94" dur="7.98">flin can go on the offensive which is</text>
  <text start="565.47" dur="6.72">why he might be hiring a different legal</text>
  <text start="568.92" dur="7.14">team the legal team he had before was</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="7.71">for defense the legal team is hiring now</text>
  <text start="576.06" dur="7.11">is for offense where he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="579.9" dur="6.48">going after these individuals everything</text>
  <text start="583.17" dur="5.13">the game has completely changed now all</text>
  <text start="586.38" dur="4.71">those people that were on defense are</text>
  <text start="588.3" dur="8.61">now going on offense let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
