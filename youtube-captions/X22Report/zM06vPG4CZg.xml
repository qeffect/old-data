  <text start="133.73" dur="5.759">when is it going to implode why is it</text>
  <text start="136.489" dur="5.28">taking so long well you have to remember</text>
  <text start="139.489" dur="5.581">the central bank the US government</text>
  <text start="141.769" dur="5.401">working together they needed to create</text>
  <text start="145.07" dur="4.41">something they needed to build something</text>
  <text start="147.17" dur="6.06">and what do they build they built an</text>
  <text start="149.48" dur="5.58">economy built on an illusion now of</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="4.65">course they&amp;#39;re making it seem like this</text>
  <text start="155.06" dur="5.58">economy is the real economy and people</text>
  <text start="157.88" dur="4.98">have jobs retail is fine this is just an</text>
  <text start="160.64" dur="4.349">anomaly GDP numbers look great</text>
  <text start="162.86" dur="4.14">everything&amp;#39;s normalizing these are the</text>
  <text start="164.989" dur="4.681">words that they use and everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167" dur="5.549">going to be okay and it takes a long</text>
  <text start="169.67" dur="5.4">time to create an illusion actually</text>
  <text start="172.549" dur="5.761">takes a long time to build anything</text>
  <text start="175.07" dur="7.11">think about it if you wanted to build a</text>
  <text start="178.31" dur="5.82">skyscraper it takes quite a while it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="3.66">got to get the permits got to get</text>
  <text start="184.13" dur="2.46">everything into place gotta get the</text>
  <text start="185.84" dur="3.27">materials</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="4.86">and then you can start building and it</text>
  <text start="189.11" dur="5.64">takes time to complete the entire</text>
  <text start="191.45" dur="6.63">building but let&amp;#39;s say you wanted to</text>
  <text start="194.75" dur="6.319">bring the building down how long does</text>
  <text start="198.08" dur="7.799">that take it doesn&amp;#39;t take long at all a</text>
  <text start="201.069" dur="7.75">lot less time to set the charges and to</text>
  <text start="205.879" dur="5.461">demolish the building compared to how</text>
  <text start="208.819" dur="6.151">long it took to actually build that</text>
  <text start="211.34" dur="8.22">structure it&amp;#39;s the same thing with the</text>
  <text start="214.97" dur="6.66">economy to build this illusion to make</text>
  <text start="219.56" dur="5.64">you believe that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="221.63" dur="6.77">well to create these bubbles like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="7.02">never seen before and to keep it alive</text>
  <text start="228.4" dur="6.58">they needed to manipulate they needed to</text>
  <text start="232.22" dur="5.609">push stimulus they needed to do things</text>
  <text start="234.98" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;ve never done before and the only</text>
  <text start="237.829" dur="5.451">way they were able to do this is because</text>
  <text start="239.78" dur="6.87">of the laws that were passed in 2008 and</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="6.64">we also have additional laws where it</text>
  <text start="246.65" dur="6.57">allows them to bail in instead of</text>
  <text start="249.92" dur="6.86">getting bailed out now remember all of</text>
  <text start="253.22" dur="6.96">this was planned from the beginning</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="7.03">because they knew that this system would</text>
  <text start="260.18" dur="4.95">only last a certain period of time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.81" dur="3.66">like when we came off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="265.13" dur="3.45">in 1971 you think they just woke up one</text>
  <text start="267.47" dur="3.12">day say hey you know something</text>
  <text start="268.58" dur="4.44">we should come off the gold standard no</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="5.31">it was planned they probably wanted to</text>
  <text start="273.02" dur="4.769">do this much much earlier in time but it</text>
  <text start="275.9" dur="4.829">just so happened to end up during that</text>
  <text start="277.789" dur="5.071">period and they created this whole plan</text>
  <text start="280.729" dur="3.511">to come off the gold standard I move on</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="3.45">to the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="284.24" dur="6.57">and then we went through a transition</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="7.32">period well this next reset this next</text>
  <text start="290.81" dur="5.46">transition this has been planned for</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="5.3">quite a while and they needed to get</text>
  <text start="296.27" dur="5.399">everything in place to make sure that</text>
  <text start="298.93" dur="6.94">they&amp;#39;re able to do this because their</text>
  <text start="301.669" dur="8.671">entire goal is to continually keep</text>
  <text start="305.87" dur="6.96">control of the economy they want to</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="6.42">start the system over and they want to</text>
  <text start="312.83" dur="5.7">have total control of the system this is</text>
  <text start="316.76" dur="3.809">why people are talking about the SDR</text>
  <text start="318.53" dur="4.68">this is why people are talking about</text>
  <text start="320.569" dur="4.56">all different things now many people</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="4.5">would like the cryptocurrency where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.129" dur="7.951">completely decentralized and the central</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="6.78">bank has no hands in the till here now a</text>
  <text start="333.08" dur="3.179">lot of people would like that that would</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="4.56">be fantastic it&amp;#39;d be great if we got rid</text>
  <text start="336.259" dur="4.83">of the central banks now remember the</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="4.679">central banks they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="341.089" dur="7.2">disappear they want to be in control now</text>
  <text start="343.729" dur="7.05">they&amp;#39;ve planned on having an SDR for</text>
  <text start="348.289" dur="6.451">quite a while now remember this is going</text>
  <text start="350.779" dur="6.241">way way back and this would sit on top</text>
  <text start="354.74" dur="4.709">of everything else where the</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="5.91">government&amp;#39;s corporations would deal in</text>
  <text start="359.449" dur="6.12">the SDR and the rest of the countries</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="5.039">for the everyday person living they</text>
  <text start="365.569" dur="4.231">would use a different currency now a lot</text>
  <text start="367.969" dur="3.15">of people say well that&amp;#39;s never going to</text>
  <text start="369.8" dur="4.469">happen they&amp;#39;ll never come out with the</text>
  <text start="371.119" dur="5.76">SDR well this is kind of already in the</text>
  <text start="374.269" dur="5.07">works the central bankers this is their</text>
  <text start="376.879" dur="3.93">plan doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s going to work but</text>
  <text start="379.339" dur="4.14">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been planning on</text>
  <text start="380.809" dur="4.32">using now people say well what about</text>
  <text start="383.479" dur="4.53">cryptocurrency they want everything to</text>
  <text start="385.129" dur="5.49">go digital well this is still in their</text>
  <text start="388.009" dur="5.46">plans now cryptocurrency is quite do the</text>
  <text start="390.619" dur="5.431">blockchain technology is quite new but</text>
  <text start="393.469" dur="4.62">they might use it not in the way that we</text>
  <text start="396.05" dur="4.109">would like to be used not the way we</text>
  <text start="398.089" dur="4.38">want it to be used but in the way that</text>
  <text start="400.159" dur="7.11">they want to use it remember they want</text>
  <text start="402.469" dur="8.76">control of this system so they might use</text>
  <text start="407.269" dur="9.96">this as the digital currency where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.229" dur="10.8">local to each country and the SDR that</text>
  <text start="417.229" dur="7.41">is used for governments corporations to</text>
  <text start="422.029" dur="5.581">trade around the world now this wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="424.639" dur="3.96">be used by everyday people and this is</text>
  <text start="427.61" dur="3.149">why when you hear the word like</text>
  <text start="428.599" dur="4.59">one-world currency and things like that</text>
  <text start="430.759" dur="4.53">this is most likely what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="433.189" dur="5.4">about now they would like this to happen</text>
  <text start="435.289" dur="4.74">they would like something like this or</text>
  <text start="438.589" dur="5.31">maybe there&amp;#39;s gonna be a variation of</text>
  <text start="440.029" dur="5.37">this but their whole entire agenda which</text>
  <text start="443.899" dur="5.7">has been planned from the very beginning</text>
  <text start="445.399" dur="7.17">is to create an instance where they can</text>
  <text start="449.599" dur="4.921">control all of it and you can see this</text>
  <text start="452.569" dur="4.791">is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do right now</text>
  <text start="454.52" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re trying to push this agenda still</text>
  <text start="457.36" dur="4.929">will they succeed well I think if the</text>
  <text start="460.52" dur="3.78">people around the world and there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="462.289" dur="4.681">protests around the world against the</text>
  <text start="464.3" dur="7.98">central banking system and we can see</text>
  <text start="466.97" dur="7.319">with the TTIP the TPP we can see that</text>
  <text start="472.28" dur="4.83">people fought back and said you know</text>
  <text start="474.289" dur="5.31">something we do not want this well the</text>
  <text start="477.11" dur="3.899">same thing would have to happen with the</text>
  <text start="479.599" dur="4.531">central bank&amp;#39;s people would have to</text>
  <text start="481.009" dur="5.91">fight back and protest and say we do not</text>
  <text start="484.13" dur="4.5">want a central bank this would be the</text>
  <text start="486.919" dur="3.87">best thing for the people we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="488.63" dur="5.879">them there&amp;#39;s no benefit to the people</text>
  <text start="490.789" dur="5.1">the only benefit is to them but we can</text>
  <text start="494.509" dur="5.75">see right now that this has been planned</text>
  <text start="495.889" dur="7.111">and they are at their last stage of</text>
  <text start="500.259" dur="4.66">bringing down the system and this is why</text>
  <text start="503" dur="4.349">we&amp;#39;re seeing everything completely</text>
  <text start="504.919" dur="3.9">deteriorate very very quickly and when</text>
  <text start="507.349" dur="3.66">we look at many of the economic</text>
  <text start="508.819" dur="3.9">indicators we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="511.009" dur="2.941">rapidly falling apart I mean when we</text>
  <text start="512.719" dur="4.051">look at automotive when we look at</text>
  <text start="513.95" dur="5.519">housing the GP numbers when we look at</text>
  <text start="516.77" dur="4.559">retail I mean it is all crashing all</text>
  <text start="519.469" dur="5.041">together now they understand as they</text>
  <text start="521.329" dur="4.921">know this Trump actually knows that this</text>
  <text start="524.51" dur="3.66">is happening remember before he became</text>
  <text start="526.25" dur="4.74">president he said there&amp;#39;s bubbles all</text>
  <text start="528.17" dur="4.65">over the place after he was inaugurated</text>
  <text start="530.99" dur="4.289">he said the economy&amp;#39;s a complete mess so</text>
  <text start="532.82" dur="4.32">he understands that this is happening</text>
  <text start="535.279" dur="3.93">right now and he&amp;#39;s also dealt with</text>
  <text start="537.14" dur="3.03">bankruptcy he&amp;#39;s also dealt with</text>
  <text start="539.209" dur="3.721">restructuring</text>
  <text start="540.17" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s also dealt with everything that is</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="5.55">happening right now in this country and</text>
  <text start="544.85" dur="5.67">around the world and again we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="548.48" dur="4.919">seen stimulus like this before we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="550.52" dur="6.45">never seen QE until right now have we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="553.399" dur="6.601">never seen an unwinding of a Fed balance</text>
  <text start="556.97" dur="4.95">sheet at the same time they are raising</text>
  <text start="560" dur="6.329">interest rates so all of this is</text>
  <text start="561.92" dur="7.14">happening at the same exact time and we</text>
  <text start="566.329" dur="5.041">know what happens when rates move up we</text>
  <text start="569.06" dur="4.74">understand that it affects many</text>
  <text start="571.37" dur="4.32">industries it affects the mortgage</text>
  <text start="573.8" dur="5.039">industry it affects the automobile</text>
  <text start="575.69" dur="5.31">industry it affects the banking industry</text>
  <text start="578.839" dur="4.86">it affects many many different things</text>
  <text start="581" dur="6.74">and a lot of these things are going to</text>
  <text start="583.699" dur="6.861">crash and they&amp;#39;ve been planning for this</text>
  <text start="587.74" dur="4.8">crash and these central bankers they</text>
  <text start="590.56" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t care if the crash is hard if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="592.54" dur="7.17">soft it makes no difference to them on</text>
  <text start="595.57" dur="5.79">how this happens all they want is to</text>
  <text start="599.71" dur="4.22">control the narrative they want to make</text>
  <text start="601.36" dur="4.71">sure they are the ones telling everyone</text>
  <text start="603.93" dur="4.08">what comes next</text>
  <text start="606.07" dur="5.67">now of course it&amp;#39;s going to look like</text>
  <text start="608.01" dur="6.79">they&amp;#39;re just there to help and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="611.74" dur="5.01">just there to fix the problems because</text>
  <text start="614.8" dur="3.92">the government is asking them but this</text>
  <text start="616.75" dur="5.1">has been planned from the beginning and</text>
  <text start="618.72" dur="5.29">it seems that we&amp;#39;re at the final stage</text>
  <text start="621.85" dur="4.56">right now because when we look at</text>
  <text start="624.01" dur="5.34">everything with flattening or inverted</text>
  <text start="626.41" dur="6.39">yield curves when we look at the retail</text>
  <text start="629.35" dur="4.74">implosion when we look at the GDP</text>
  <text start="632.8" dur="2.88">numbers when we look at there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="634.09" dur="3.39">manufacturing left in this country when</text>
  <text start="635.68" dur="4.02">we see there&amp;#39;s debt that cannot be</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="4.11">sustained because the tax revenue that</text>
  <text start="639.7" dur="3.63">is coming in from corporations from</text>
  <text start="641.59" dur="3.75">everyday people are continually</text>
  <text start="643.33" dur="5.28">declining well we have a major problem</text>
  <text start="645.34" dur="6.84">here and this problem is not just going</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="7.44">to go away and remember to build a</text>
  <text start="652.18" dur="7.76">building it could take years for a</text>
  <text start="656.05" dur="8.22">building to come down it takes one day</text>
  <text start="659.94" dur="8.05">not even a day a couple of hours that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.27" dur="6.38">how quickly this system can come down</text>
  <text start="667.99" dur="5.1">and this is what we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="670.65" dur="5.23">we&amp;#39;re going to see the system come down</text>
  <text start="673.09" dur="7.26">because they needed to look horrific</text>
  <text start="675.88" dur="8.73">so they can do the next step think about</text>
  <text start="680.35" dur="6.87">what happened in 2008 when the system</text>
  <text start="684.61" dur="4.98">was coming down I mean there was a lot</text>
  <text start="687.22" dur="3.87">of fear-mongering there saying we better</text>
  <text start="689.59" dur="4.59">do this well the whole system just falls</text>
  <text start="691.09" dur="5.55">apart and of course the Fed came in and</text>
  <text start="694.18" dur="5.19">said we will start stimulus and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="696.64" dur="5.85">worry there&amp;#39;ll only be one QE then there</text>
  <text start="699.37" dur="5.22">was two three then QE forever they</text>
  <text start="702.49" dur="3.77">started buying bonds the government</text>
  <text start="704.59" dur="5.22">started manipulating all the numbers I</text>
  <text start="706.26" dur="6.61">mean the whole thing was one gigantic</text>
  <text start="709.81" dur="6.87">illusion at that point and the Fed will</text>
  <text start="712.87" dur="5.82">gain control of the stock market gain</text>
  <text start="716.68" dur="5.05">control of the real estate market gain</text>
  <text start="718.69" dur="4.36">control of pretty much everything and</text>
  <text start="721.73" dur="4.859">other central banks and countries around</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="6.12">the world also gain control so this time</text>
  <text start="726.589" dur="6.601">around they&amp;#39;re going to do the same</text>
  <text start="729.17" dur="6.39">exact thing fear-mongering the Fed needs</text>
  <text start="733.19" dur="6.209">to help the central bank&amp;#39;s need to help</text>
  <text start="735.56" dur="6.81">and we will start seeing this transition</text>
  <text start="739.399" dur="5.31">and this transition is going to be</text>
  <text start="742.37" dur="4.29">transitioning away from the dollar</text>
  <text start="744.709" dur="4.111">because they understand and we can see</text>
  <text start="746.66" dur="5.07">what&amp;#39;s happening in the Middle East this</text>
  <text start="748.82" dur="5.94">petro dollar system this system is</text>
  <text start="751.73" dur="6.69">coming to an end and when we transition</text>
  <text start="754.76" dur="7.68">it will be a new system there will be a</text>
  <text start="758.42" dur="6.9">new system in place and the dollar</text>
  <text start="762.44" dur="4.589">well that will no longer exist now they</text>
  <text start="765.32" dur="4.079">might call the next currency something</text>
  <text start="767.029" dur="4.62">else I mean it might be the crypto</text>
  <text start="769.399" dur="4.921">dollar might be something else a</text>
  <text start="771.649" dur="6">completely different name but they will</text>
  <text start="774.32" dur="6.74">create something in this country to be</text>
  <text start="777.649" dur="7.831">used locally and what that means is that</text>
  <text start="781.06" dur="9.37">the value of the dollar is going to have</text>
  <text start="785.48" dur="7.14">to be decreased which means the currency</text>
  <text start="790.43" dur="4.8">that you have in the bank the currency</text>
  <text start="792.62" dur="4.589">that is in your pension plans the</text>
  <text start="795.23" dur="4.62">currency that is in this stock market</text>
  <text start="797.209" dur="5.07">all this paper stuff that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="799.85" dur="5.19">right now well it&amp;#39;s all going to be</text>
  <text start="802.279" dur="4.201">devalued and a lot of people are going</text>
  <text start="805.04" dur="4.83">to be hurt by this they understand this</text>
  <text start="806.48" dur="5.76">I mean look what happened in Cyprus they</text>
  <text start="809.87" dur="4.44">lock down the banks people didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="812.24" dur="3.839">riot they said we&amp;#39;re taking your</text>
  <text start="814.31" dur="4.74">currency and there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do</text>
  <text start="816.079" dur="4.351">about it and it just happened and they</text>
  <text start="819.05" dur="4.349">were like they were they went through</text>
  <text start="820.43" dur="7.29">this for over a year they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="823.399" dur="6.69">make it seem like this is good for the</text>
  <text start="827.72" dur="4.14">people even though this is going to be</text>
  <text start="830.089" dur="4.68">the worst thing ever and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="831.86" dur="6.33">to make it seem like it has to be this</text>
  <text start="834.769" dur="6.991">way and as an American or as a Canadian</text>
  <text start="838.19" dur="7.519">or as an Australian you have to be loyal</text>
  <text start="841.76" dur="6.78">to the country just like in 1933 1929</text>
  <text start="845.709" dur="5.11">when they said if you know we need your</text>
  <text start="848.54" dur="5.789">gold we need you need to help America</text>
  <text start="850.819" dur="4.521">they&amp;#39;re going to create this entire</text>
  <text start="854.329" dur="4.921">narrative</text>
  <text start="855.34" dur="8.32">to make you feel guilty that you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="859.25" dur="7.74">doing what they want this is how they</text>
  <text start="863.66" dur="7.32">work because they&amp;#39;re going to make it</text>
  <text start="866.99" dur="7.08">seem like if you don&amp;#39;t sacrifice if you</text>
  <text start="870.98" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t do this well you&amp;#39;re not a true</text>
  <text start="874.07" dur="4.26">American if you don&amp;#39;t do this you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="876.26" dur="4.47">a true Canadian if you don&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="878.33" dur="5.49">you&amp;#39;re not a true Australian they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="880.73" dur="6.06">going to do this to make you feel like</text>
  <text start="883.82" dur="6.24">okay I should turn in my gold and silver</text>
  <text start="886.79" dur="5.34">I should just take the devalued new</text>
  <text start="890.06" dur="4.94">currency and I&amp;#39;ll just have to lose it</text>
  <text start="892.13" dur="5.7">because it&amp;#39;s best for the country and</text>
  <text start="895" dur="5.5">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been planning on</text>
  <text start="897.83" dur="6.74">for a very long time and this is how</text>
  <text start="900.5" dur="7.59">they&amp;#39;re going to try to reset the entire</text>
  <text start="904.57" dur="7.42">system they&amp;#39;re going to usher in a brand</text>
  <text start="908.09" dur="6.54">new currency and it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="911.99" dur="5.61">getting closer and closer to that time</text>
  <text start="914.63" dur="5.49">period because you know without stimulus</text>
  <text start="917.6" dur="5.07">you know with the rising interest rates</text>
  <text start="920.12" dur="4.59">you know with the economy deteriorating</text>
  <text start="922.67" dur="4.26">and imploding on itself and I know many</text>
  <text start="924.71" dur="4.47">people don&amp;#39;t see it there are others</text>
  <text start="926.93" dur="3.84">that are experiencing it right now</text>
  <text start="929.18" dur="3.93">everyone doesn&amp;#39;t experience everything</text>
  <text start="930.77" dur="5.99">at the same exact time but eventually we</text>
  <text start="933.11" dur="6.18">will everyone will be dragged into this</text>
  <text start="936.76" dur="5.2">everyone was dragged into this in the</text>
  <text start="939.29" dur="5.52">beginning of the system but then the</text>
  <text start="941.96" dur="4.62">system wasn&amp;#39;t built on debt the system</text>
  <text start="944.81" dur="3.24">was going into something completely</text>
  <text start="946.58" dur="3.96">different where they&amp;#39;re able to produce</text>
  <text start="948.05" dur="4.14">as many dollars as possible which</text>
  <text start="950.54" dur="3.54">actually devalued the dollar at that</text>
  <text start="952.19" dur="5.22">point but people thought they were</text>
  <text start="954.08" dur="5.01">making more currency it was part of the</text>
  <text start="957.41" dur="4.38">illusion to get on to the new system</text>
  <text start="959.09" dur="4.41">well we&amp;#39;re at the end of this system now</text>
  <text start="961.79" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s completely different it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="963.5" dur="5.1">opposite way this is why wages are</text>
  <text start="965.39" dur="5.49">dropping this is why the economy is</text>
  <text start="968.6" dur="6.48">deteriorating very very quickly we have</text>
  <text start="970.88" dur="7.17">a huge amount of debt and this time</text>
  <text start="975.08" dur="6.26">we&amp;#39;re coming from a system that does not</text>
  <text start="978.05" dur="6">work and they&amp;#39;re trying to bring in a</text>
  <text start="981.34" dur="4.96">new system that is going to be</text>
  <text start="984.05" dur="4.229">completely different and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="986.3" dur="4.289">to have to devalue because the</text>
  <text start="988.279" dur="4.47">United States right now is no longer the</text>
  <text start="990.589" dur="3.48">reserve currency of the world well it</text>
  <text start="992.749" dur="4.83">won&amp;#39;t be the reserve currency of the</text>
  <text start="994.069" dur="5.491">world before we still were we were just</text>
  <text start="997.579" dur="4.62">coming off a great system which was</text>
  <text start="999.56" dur="4.939">attached to gold we came off and then</text>
  <text start="1002.199" dur="4.981">all of a sudden the dollar was devalued</text>
  <text start="1004.499" dur="5.26">that&amp;#39;s why we saw inflation people</text>
  <text start="1007.18" dur="4.44">thought wow this is incredible I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1009.759" dur="3.421">making more money the house prices and</text>
  <text start="1011.62" dur="4.8">yes in the beginning of the system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1013.18" dur="5.629">great well we&amp;#39;re not there anymore that</text>
  <text start="1016.42" dur="4.529">greatness is gone that feeling of</text>
  <text start="1018.809" dur="4.51">greatness is gone the high interest</text>
  <text start="1020.949" dur="3.541">rates that is gone why do you think</text>
  <text start="1023.319" dur="2.37">we&amp;#39;re at negative interest rates why do</text>

  <text start="1025.689" dur="5.97">so we&amp;#39;re getting very very close to this</text>
  <text start="1028.87" dur="5.339">reset and the only way you can really</text>
  <text start="1031.659" dur="5.16">protect yourself I mean if you have lots</text>
  <text start="1034.209" dur="5">of land that would be great gold silver</text>
