  <text start="162.03" dur="6.929">looks like the UK is prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="165.57" dur="5.52">to remove itself from the EU and I</text>
  <text start="168.959" dur="5.011">believe that other countries now are</text>
  <text start="171.09" dur="4.35">gonna jump on board with this especially</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="3">with the immigration problems and</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="3.87">everything else I think there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="176.97" dur="4.17">many other European countries that say</text>
  <text start="179.31" dur="4.649">you know something maybe it&amp;#39;s time for</text>
  <text start="181.14" dur="4.499">us to leave the EU now here in the</text>
  <text start="183.959" dur="3.211">United States we see that consumer</text>
  <text start="185.639" dur="4.411">confidence well it discipline</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="6.23">in June we see that expectations were</text>
  <text start="190.05" dur="6.6">around 128 came in around 120 6.4 and</text>
  <text start="193.4" dur="6.37">those people that were looking to</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="4.74">purchase autos major appliances well the</text>
  <text start="199.77" dur="3.9">hope of purchasing those type of items</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="4.8">that kind of tumbled but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="203.67" dur="4.56">interesting is that we see the highest</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="4.89">income Americans they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="208.23" dur="6.12">confidence in the system and the</text>
  <text start="211.08" dur="6.689">lower-income Americans they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="5.07">confidence now soar so we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="217.769" dur="4.261">opposite effect right now because maybe</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="5.16">these individuals who aren&amp;#39;t making that</text>
  <text start="222.03" dur="4.44">much they believe in the future things</text>
  <text start="224.58" dur="3.81">are going to get a lot better and those</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="4.2">people that are taking advantage of the</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="5.34">system right now they&amp;#39;re looking at it</text>
  <text start="230.67" dur="7.23">going ok times up and everything&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="7.38">to change we see that that everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="6.57">about the change with Toys R Us in three</text>
  <text start="241.11" dur="6.03">days the last Toys R Us store will</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="5.31">completely disappear and this is not the</text>
  <text start="247.14" dur="4.68">only brick-and-mortar store and remember</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="4.59">Toys R Us already had an online presence</text>
  <text start="251.82" dur="6.03">too they had both but we can see that</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="6.33">this is really hitting hard and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.85" dur="5.04">affecting a lot of these retailers</text>
  <text start="260.7" dur="4.32">because the economy has been doing well</text>
  <text start="262.89" dur="3.45">for a very long time it&amp;#39;s been getting</text>
  <text start="265.02" dur="3.209">worse a lot of stores have been closing</text>
  <text start="266.34" dur="3.48">the corporate offices have been closing</text>
  <text start="268.229" dur="3.75">and a lot of people have been losing</text>
  <text start="269.82" dur="7.349">their jobs actually if we look at Toys R</text>
  <text start="271.979" dur="6.631">Us 33,000 employees when everything is</text>
  <text start="277.169" dur="4.831">all said and done and everything&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="278.61" dur="6">they will all be out of a job think</text>
  <text start="282" dur="3.96">about the rest of the retailers not just</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="3.48">thinking of the stores and the part time</text>
  <text start="285.96" dur="4.62">workers think about all the full time</text>
  <text start="288.09" dur="4.77">corporate employees that work for these</text>
  <text start="290.58" dur="4.29">organizations they&amp;#39;re all gonna have to</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="5.67">start looking for jobs and again if</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="5.549">retail is continually declining where</text>
  <text start="298.53" dur="3.87">are they finding these jobs and this has</text>
  <text start="300.419" dur="4.711">been the same argument that we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="302.4" dur="6.48">for a very long time no they&amp;#39;re not all</text>
  <text start="305.13" dur="7.98">going to amazon because amazon is a very</text>
  <text start="308.88" dur="9.289">small percentage of the entire retail</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="7.889">industry we see that us home prices well</text>
  <text start="318.169" dur="7.87">the growth is starting to slow</text>
  <text start="320.999" dur="8.63">now we saw this happen back in 2006-2007</text>
  <text start="326.039" dur="6.39">where housing prices they hit a peak and</text>
  <text start="329.629" dur="6.22">it was the top of the bubble and then</text>
  <text start="332.429" dur="6.39">they started coming down not nothing not</text>
  <text start="335.849" dur="5.25">everywhere in certain areas this started</text>
  <text start="338.819" dur="4.26">to happen I&amp;#39;ll give you an example in</text>
  <text start="341.099" dur="3.9">New York prices started to come down</text>
  <text start="343.079" dur="4.68">very slowly traffic started to dry up</text>
  <text start="344.999" dur="4.44">but in Miami in Florida they were still</text>
  <text start="347.759" dur="4.77">building speculators were still coming</text>
  <text start="349.439" dur="6.09">in this was back in 2006-2007 but when</text>
  <text start="352.529" dur="5.7">it hit right after 2008 it hit hard in</text>
  <text start="355.529" dur="6.09">Florida so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="358.229" dur="6.54">is that all of a sudden home prices and</text>
  <text start="361.619" dur="7.89">remember the bubble was inflated above</text>
  <text start="364.769" dur="6.27">the 2008 housing bubble and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="369.509" dur="4.76">starting to see home prices come down</text>
  <text start="371.039" dur="5.25">which means traffic is going to dry up</text>
  <text start="374.269" dur="4.27">individuals are gonna have a tougher</text>
  <text start="376.289" dur="3.571">time selling their houses and as they</text>
  <text start="378.539" dur="3.39">have a tougher time selling their houses</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="4.589">people are going to lose confidence</text>
  <text start="381.929" dur="4.74">remember confidence is built up when you</text>
  <text start="384.449" dur="4.08">believe you have all this equity in your</text>
  <text start="386.669" dur="4.05">home you feel good you feel comfortable</text>
  <text start="388.529" dur="4.41">when it starts to deflate when the</text>
  <text start="390.719" dur="5.13">prices start to come down people lose</text>
  <text start="392.939" dur="5.671">that feeling and they feel like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.849" dur="4.41">losing their money so they tighten up</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="3.059">they don&amp;#39;t go out and they spent they</text>
  <text start="400.259" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t go out and spend like they did</text>
  <text start="401.669" dur="4.56">they don&amp;#39;t take equity lines of credit</text>
  <text start="403.649" dur="5.01">out on their homes refinancing is going</text>
  <text start="406.229" dur="6.05">to die and we&amp;#39;re starting to see home</text>
  <text start="408.659" dur="6.69">prices fall in New York San Francisco</text>
  <text start="412.279" dur="5.59">Washington and many other cities and</text>
  <text start="415.349" dur="4.29">these are all the case-shiller 20-city</text>
  <text start="417.869" dur="3.93">composite where they look at these</text>
  <text start="419.639" dur="5.52">cities and say look housing is doing</text>
  <text start="421.799" dur="5.58">fantastically again the central bank was</text>
  <text start="425.159" dur="5.91">able to pump the bubbles up in these</text>
  <text start="427.379" dur="6.75">areas and now it is deflating we see</text>
  <text start="431.069" dur="5.07">right now there&amp;#39;s a conflicting story</text>
  <text start="434.129" dur="4.74">right now because Steve minuchin who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.139" dur="4.83">the secretary of the Treasury came out</text>
  <text start="438.869" dur="4.02">and put out a Twitter message that the</text>
  <text start="440.969" dur="3.78">White House was considering limiting</text>
  <text start="442.889" dur="3.66">investment in the United States from all</text>
  <text start="444.749" dur="5.73">countries that were trying to steal US</text>
  <text start="446.549" dur="6.061">technology and Trump is saying that no</text>
  <text start="450.479" dur="4.321">we had no plans to limit Chinese</text>
  <text start="452.61" dur="4.26">investment in US companies</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="3.48">I don&amp;#39;t know why minuchin was out there</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="3.9">putting this message out there now this</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="5.34">happened once before where minutia n--</text>
  <text start="460.77" dur="4.98">was out there telling the world</text>
  <text start="463.62" dur="4.65">something completely different that was</text>
  <text start="465.75" dur="4.919">going on actually that Trump was gonna</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="5.13">be you know looking at the TPP and most</text>
  <text start="470.669" dur="6.15">likely reinstating the TPP which never</text>
  <text start="473.4" dur="6.54">happened and once again venusian is out</text>
  <text start="476.819" dur="5.25">there tweeting on behalf of Trump and I</text>
  <text start="479.94" dur="4.74">think basically what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="482.069" dur="4.831">right now is kind of setting him up to</text>
  <text start="484.68" dur="5.519">take the fall later on and remember</text>
  <text start="486.9" dur="4.919">munition is a goldman sachs boy and i</text>
  <text start="490.199" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t believe he&amp;#39;s a good guy right now</text>
  <text start="491.819" dur="4.47">i think he&amp;#39;s on the bad side just like</text>
  <text start="494.789" dur="3.241">certain other people that were in the</text>
  <text start="496.289" dur="4.261">administration like McMasters</text>
  <text start="498.03" dur="5.009">I think Bolton is on that same side with</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="4.29">McMasters but again Trump is keeping</text>
  <text start="503.039" dur="5.13">them in there to keep an eye on all</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="6.72">these individuals we keep hearing that</text>
  <text start="508.169" dur="6.841">trade tariffs are going to crash the</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="5.64">world economy and we need to take a</text>
  <text start="515.01" dur="3.949">closer look at this and see what is</text>
  <text start="517.2" dur="4.92">going on here remember we have two sides</text>
  <text start="518.959" dur="5.411">fighting this out we understand that the</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="4.14">central banks they&amp;#39;re raising the rates</text>
  <text start="524.37" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re tightening right now because</text>
  <text start="526.26" dur="3.24">what they did was they created this</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="5.58">gigantic illusion where they have all</text>
  <text start="529.5" dur="4.95">this toxic stuff on their books from</text>
  <text start="533.13" dur="2.34">real estate and everything else and</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re trying to get rid of it right</text>
  <text start="535.47" dur="5.58">now they&amp;#39;re raising rates right now to</text>
  <text start="539.13" dur="4.35">start the collapse of the system and</text>
  <text start="541.05" dur="4.11">again Powell was out there once again</text>
  <text start="543.48" dur="2.64">saying that yes he&amp;#39;s getting ready to</text>
  <text start="545.16" dur="3.03">pop the bubbles</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="4.56">we know that the biz is trying to</text>
  <text start="548.19" dur="6.36">separate themselves from the insolvent</text>
  <text start="550.68" dur="5.46">banking system and right now we have</text>
  <text start="554.55" dur="3.75">this war where the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="556.14" dur="4.98">saying that all these tariffs well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="558.3" dur="5.3">going to crash the world economy but the</text>
  <text start="561.12" dur="5.579">thing is tariffs are not gonna do this</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="5.95">monetary policy will who&amp;#39;s in control</text>
  <text start="566.699" dur="5.64">the monetary policy that is the central</text>
  <text start="569.55" dur="6">bank now The Economist magazine put out</text>
  <text start="572.339" dur="4.951">this statement rising tariffs are the</text>
  <text start="575.55" dur="3.38">worst of many threats to the world</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="4.35">economy because among other things</text>
  <text start="578.93" dur="4.719">tariffs temporarily push up inflation</text>
  <text start="581.64" dur="4.97">making it harder for central banks to</text>
  <text start="583.649" dur="5.101">cushion the blow now this statement</text>
  <text start="586.61" dur="4.84">displays a deeply in</text>
  <text start="588.75" dur="5.73">Trench confusion if not utter</text>
  <text start="591.45" dur="5.43">misunderstanding of some of the basic</text>
  <text start="594.48" dur="4.38">economic concepts most important many</text>
  <text start="596.88" dur="4.02">people fail to correctly distinguish</text>
  <text start="598.86" dur="4.32">between the causes and effects of price</text>
  <text start="600.9" dur="5.88">inflation and those of monetary</text>

  <text start="617.37" dur="4.32">rise in prices of goods and services</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="5.33">which we can refer to as price inflation</text>
  <text start="621.69" dur="5.51">however this general rise in prices</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="5.71">following monetary inflation is</text>
  <text start="627.2" dur="5.23">disproportionate and staggered prices</text>
  <text start="630.27" dur="4.35">will rise at different times and to</text>
  <text start="632.43" dur="5.49">different extent as money reaches a</text>
  <text start="634.62" dur="6.15">lower purchasing power but monetary</text>
  <text start="637.92" dur="5.55">inflation also has a non-price effect</text>
  <text start="640.77" dur="5.1">one of these is the transfer of wealth</text>
  <text start="643.47" dur="5.31">between the last receiver of the new</text>
  <text start="645.87" dur="4.44">money toward the first receiver another</text>
  <text start="648.78" dur="3.57">and even more important is the</text>
  <text start="650.31" dur="4.08">distortion of the pattern of investment</text>
  <text start="652.35" dur="4.68">and production as the new money being</text>

  <text start="657.03" dur="4.08">stock markets and businesses the sort of</text>
  <text start="659.28" dur="4.29">artificially reducing the interest rate</text>
  <text start="661.11" dur="4.35">this latter effect explains the</text>

  <text start="665.46" dur="4.8">misaligned with consumer preferences and</text>
  <text start="668.19" dur="5.01">if we just look at the last part of this</text>
  <text start="670.26" dur="6.12">what happens is is we have an economic</text>
  <text start="673.2" dur="6.12">bust or crash because it&amp;#39;s misaligned</text>
