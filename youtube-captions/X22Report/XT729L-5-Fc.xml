  <text start="139.2" dur="3.599">see right now that Lebanon right now is</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="5.639">they&amp;#39;re using this for a proxy type of</text>
  <text start="142.799" dur="6.901">war with most likely Iran so we need to</text>
  <text start="146.549" dur="6">look at these nations Ecuador after a</text>

  <text start="154.44" dur="6.329">balloon to a nine-year high relative to</text>
  <text start="158.459" dur="4.261">its GDP we look at Ukraine and we</text>
  <text start="160.769" dur="5.19">understand what happened in Ukraine they</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="5.73">are defaulting they are in a huge amount</text>
  <text start="165.959" dur="6.06">of debt about seventeen point five</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="8.94">billion in debt right now and we see</text>
  <text start="172.019" dur="7.861">that the country is still struggling to</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="4.14">move forward we see Egypt Egypt&amp;#39;s credit</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="3.779">default swaps are hovering near the</text>
  <text start="181.53" dur="4.41">highest in September the cost for</text>
  <text start="183.659" dur="3.331">protection surged in June as regional</text>

  <text start="186.99" dur="6.83">we also see Pakistan Baja rain Turkey</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="6.99">all these nations right now are</text>
  <text start="193.82" dur="5.92">connected and if Venezuela goes down or</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="4.41">something happens as a Black Swan it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.74" dur="3.66">going to affect these nations and these</text>
  <text start="201.78" dur="4.08">nations are going to affect other</text>
  <text start="203.4" dur="5.61">nations and it&amp;#39;s going to be a domino</text>
  <text start="205.86" dur="6.87">effect we see that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="6.12">out there is trying to make it look like</text>
  <text start="212.73" dur="4.23">that the consumer debt problem is really</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="4.77">not a problem here in the United States</text>
  <text start="216.96" dur="4.47">and we talked about how people are</text>
  <text start="219.9" dur="3.39">living off credit cards we understand</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="3.54">the global debt problem and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.29" dur="4.71">saying that yes there&amp;#39;s a lot of debt</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="5.52">out there but according to the reports</text>
  <text start="228" dur="7.23">it doesn&amp;#39;t seem that the this type of</text>
  <text start="230.49" dur="8.13">debt is going to slow the economy or</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="5.97">hurt the economy just yet but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.62" dur="4.77">saying there are cracks forming and this</text>
  <text start="241.2" dur="3.72">is their way of saying that there isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="3.99">really a debt problem remember the</text>
  <text start="244.92" dur="3.87">central banking system they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="247.38" dur="5.1">to talk bad about the central bank the</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="5.91">Fed this is their product debt they</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t want debt to make they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="5.039">debt to seem bad they don&amp;#39;t want it they</text>
  <text start="257.43" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t want debt to look make</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="5.011">it look like the economy is doing poorly</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="4.86">because of the debt problem because if</text>
  <text start="264.75" dur="4.23">this is true then all the central banks</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="4.41">around the world who have been loaning</text>
  <text start="268.98" dur="4.59">their currency out with interest well</text>
  <text start="271.59" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re out of business so they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="273.57" dur="5.43">allow this to happen but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="6.87">interesting is that the ECB and other</text>
  <text start="279" dur="5.52">central banks they&amp;#39;re looking to maybe</text>
  <text start="282.42" dur="5.19">get rid of the deposit protection scheme</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="5.07">and what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the</text>
  <text start="287.61" dur="4.02">covered depositing claims under investor</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="4.53">compensation schemes should be replaced</text>
  <text start="291.63" dur="4.89">by limited discretionary exemptions to</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="4.53">be granted by the competent authority in</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="5.49">order to retain a degree of flexibility</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="5.88">now to translate all this what the ECB</text>
  <text start="302.01" dur="4.29">is saying is they wanted to get rid they</text>
  <text start="304.53" dur="4.11">want to get rid of the deposit level</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="5.46">right now which protects individuals</text>
  <text start="308.64" dur="6.21">with about a hundred thousand euros so</text>
  <text start="311.76" dur="4.83">if the bank goes belly-up you have the</text>
  <text start="314.85" dur="4.2">insurance and you get your money back</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="4.29">and they don&amp;#39;t want this because what</text>
  <text start="319.05" dur="3.9">the reasoning they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="320.88" dur="5.22">is that they&amp;#39;re saying that because of</text>
  <text start="322.95" dur="5.28">this protection like the FDIC the</text>
  <text start="326.1" dur="5.13">insurance where it protects you against</text>
  <text start="328.23" dur="6.54">a bank failing they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="331.23" dur="6.03">insurance makes it so people will go in</text>
  <text start="334.77" dur="5.31">and take their money out and there might</text>
  <text start="337.26" dur="5.22">be a bank run on these banks that are</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="6.27">failing which makes no sense to me</text>
  <text start="342.48" dur="7.32">because if it&amp;#39;s insured by the</text>
  <text start="346.35" dur="5.28">government you wouldn&amp;#39;t really see a</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="4.26">bank run I mean people if they hear a</text>
  <text start="351.63" dur="5.31">bank is failing they&amp;#39;re gonna go in and</text>
  <text start="354.06" dur="5.46">take their funds out anyhow what I think</text>
  <text start="356.94" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.52" dur="5.82">preparing for this next crisis they</text>
  <text start="362.22" dur="4.5">understand that most of these banks are</text>
  <text start="365.34" dur="3.78">completely insolvent especially in</text>
  <text start="366.72" dur="3.9">Europe here in the United States too but</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="3.75">Europe is a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="4.08">and I think what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="4.41">is they realize that their insurance</text>
  <text start="374.7" dur="5.25">that they have set up right now will not</text>
  <text start="377.28" dur="6.45">cover the number of banks that will be</text>
  <text start="379.95" dur="6.18">going down and they came out with this</text>
  <text start="383.73" dur="5.79">ECB paper it was published on November</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="6.08">8th 2017 entitled on revisions to the</text>
  <text start="389.52" dur="4.41">Union crisis management framework and</text>
  <text start="392.21" dur="4.8">the balance</text>
  <text start="393.93" dur="6.78">they are basically reworking the beylin</text>
  <text start="397.01" dur="6.67">documentation to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="400.71" dur="6.75">insurance part of it and we can see that</text>
  <text start="403.68" dur="6.15">it looks like they are preparing for the</text>
  <text start="407.46" dur="4.71">next crisis because they understand when</text>
  <text start="409.83" dur="4.47">this crisis hit people and they&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="412.17" dur="3.75">this before remember they do many tests</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="2.97">in all different countries to see how</text>
  <text start="415.92" dur="3.09">people are going to react to certain</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="2.82">things they saw in Greece when they</text>
  <text start="419.01" dur="3.93">heard you know they were going to be</text>
  <text start="420.09" dur="5.07">balanced banks might be shut down they</text>
  <text start="422.94" dur="3.66">ran to the banks they took out their</text>
  <text start="425.16" dur="3.84">currency it happened in Italy it</text>
  <text start="426.6" dur="5.76">happened in Spain and they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
  <text start="429" dur="4.89">excuse that you know the insurance makes</text>
  <text start="432.36" dur="3.78">people think that they have to go and</text>
  <text start="433.89" dur="4.98">rescue their money which makes no sense</text>
  <text start="436.14" dur="5.78">to me whatsoever they&amp;#39;re trying to cover</text>
  <text start="438.87" dur="5.43">themselves the central banking system is</text>
  <text start="441.92" dur="5.05">trying to cover themselves because they</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="4.41">know when these banks go belly-up they</text>
  <text start="446.97" dur="4.71">know that the insurance will not cover</text>
  <text start="448.71" dur="5.94">any of this here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="451.68" dur="5.73">know there&amp;#39;s not enough of</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="4.98">the FDIC insurance to cover the number</text>
  <text start="457.41" dur="4.74">of banks that will flow yes if one two</text>
  <text start="459.63" dur="5.069">or three banks fail they might have</text>
  <text start="462.15" dur="6.15">enough to cover those bangs if ten fail</text>
  <text start="464.699" dur="5.431">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible they will not</text>
  <text start="468.3" dur="5.81">be able to do it</text>
  <text start="470.13" dur="6.78">and we see at this point they</text>
  <text start="474.11" dur="4.809">implemented the FDIC insurance and other</text>
  <text start="476.91" dur="5.61">insurance around the world after the</text>
  <text start="478.919" dur="6.06">depression to build the confidence back</text>
  <text start="482.52" dur="4.8">up so people would say hey I can put my</text>
  <text start="484.979" dur="4.051">money in the bank it&amp;#39;s insured</text>
  <text start="487.32" dur="3.54">I don&amp;#39;t have to worry if the bank fails</text>
  <text start="489.03" dur="3.06">I will not lose my money because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.86" dur="4.559">what happened during the Great</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="7.68">Depression and now they want to get rid</text>
  <text start="495.419" dur="8.28">of it because the crisis is too big they</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="6.57">can&amp;#39;t control the size of this crisis</text>
  <text start="503.699" dur="4.051">and this is why you need to be ready and</text>
  <text start="506.34" dur="3.48">prepared and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="507.75" dur="6.39">balance for quite a while this is when</text>
  <text start="509.82" dur="7.38">the bank goes in and actually takes your</text>
  <text start="514.14" dur="7.019">currency and gives you worthless stock</text>
  <text start="517.2" dur="6.329">of that bank that is failing and then</text>
  <text start="521.159" dur="3.901">they create this bank holiday they put</text>
  <text start="523.529" dur="3.93">restrictions on how much you can take</text>
  <text start="525.06" dur="5.43">out of your own funds and all of a</text>
  <text start="527.459" dur="5.701">sudden your money is trapped inside of</text>
  <text start="530.49" dur="4.92">the bank that is a balun a bailout is</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="5.07">when the government uses taxpayer money</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="4.41">to give it to these financial</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="4.979">institutions to bail out whatever they</text>
  <text start="539.82" dur="5.01">need to be bailed out from and we see at</text>
  <text start="543.209" dur="4.341">this point that governments right now</text>
  <text start="544.83" dur="5.04">well they&amp;#39;re not doing the bailout thing</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="4.06">so the banks had to come up with some</text>
  <text start="549.87" dur="3.69">other idea and this is why they had</text>
  <text start="551.61" dur="3.87">created the bail in documents they</text>
  <text start="553.56" dur="4.14">tested it in Cyprus they tested it in</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="4.47">Greece they tested it in India they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="557.7" dur="5.55">testing it all over the place to see how</text>
  <text start="559.95" dur="5.13">this actually works and what the</text>
  <text start="563.25" dur="4.05">reaction is from the people and they</text>
  <text start="565.08" dur="4.14">realized that oh people are gonna be</text>
  <text start="567.3" dur="4.53">running to these banks to try to get</text>
  <text start="569.22" dur="4.77">their funds out of the banks and they</text>
  <text start="571.83" dur="4.259">know that that&amp;#39;s gonna be impossible</text>
  <text start="573.99" dur="4.68">because the banks don&amp;#39;t really keep that</text>
  <text start="576.089" dur="5.581">type of currency in the banks they also</text>
  <text start="578.67" dur="4.77">know that the insurance that they have</text>
  <text start="581.67" dur="3.6">in all these banks is not going to be</text>
  <text start="583.44" dur="3.87">enough to cover the number of banks that</text>
  <text start="585.27" dur="2.85">are going to be going down so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="587.31" dur="2.88">real</text>
