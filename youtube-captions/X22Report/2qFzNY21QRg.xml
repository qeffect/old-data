  <text start="101.97" dur="4.35">economy has been deteriorating for quite</text>
  <text start="104.76" dur="3.93">a while we&amp;#39;ve been watching this we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="4.95">been tracking it we&amp;#39;ve been sifting</text>
  <text start="108.69" dur="4.97">through all the statistical numbers that</text>
  <text start="111.27" dur="5.07">the Fed the government throws out and</text>
  <text start="113.66" dur="4.18">basically we weed through them and we</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="4.47">find out that most of them are</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="5.76">completely fake I say 99.999% of them</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re skewed in a certain way to make</text>
  <text start="123.6" dur="5.16">everyone believe that we are in this</text>
  <text start="126.06" dur="5.34">incredible recovery which we are not and</text>
  <text start="128.76" dur="4.62">we understand at this point there is a</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="4.38">battle going on within government we</text>
  <text start="133.38" dur="4.53">understand there&amp;#39;s factions that are</text>
  <text start="135.78" dur="4.77">fighting it out and the central bank</text>
  <text start="137.91" dur="6">realizes and they understand that the</text>
  <text start="140.55" dur="6.36">economy is pretty much dead so does the</text>
  <text start="143.91" dur="7.17">deep state so does the IMF so does the</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="7.799">biz they all realize understand that the</text>
  <text start="151.08" dur="6.39">dollar is dead it&amp;#39;s at its end stage and</text>
  <text start="154.709" dur="5.28">the central bankers they do what they do</text>
  <text start="157.47" dur="4.65">best they pump up the economy they</text>
  <text start="159.989" dur="4.921">create bubbles they make everyone think</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="4.35">that the economy is fantastic they make</text>
  <text start="164.91" dur="2.85">sure that everyone is all in there all</text>
  <text start="166.47" dur="3.45">talking about real estate they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="4.35">talking about the stock market how great</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="3.66">the economy is this is fantastic</text>
  <text start="172.11" dur="3.99">and then all of a sudden one day</text>
  <text start="173.58" dur="4.53">everyone wakes up and the market comes</text>
  <text start="176.1" dur="3.3">down and then companies start to lay off</text>
  <text start="178.11" dur="4.14">and people are scratching their heads</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="5.9">people lose fortunes this is how they</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="6.74">operate and the pattern fits</text>
  <text start="185.3" dur="5.88">the same way over time I mean if you</text>
  <text start="188.99" dur="4.89">look back in history they kind of used</text>
  <text start="191.18" dur="5.67">the same exact methods where they raise</text>
  <text start="193.88" dur="4.8">the interest rates very very slowly they</text>
  <text start="196.85" dur="4.32">bring everything down they pop the</text>
  <text start="198.68" dur="5.16">bubbles and then they start lowering the</text>
  <text start="201.17" dur="5.22">interest rates and we see at this time</text>
  <text start="203.84" dur="4.83">this is how they have been controlling</text>
  <text start="206.39" dur="4.26">the economy and this time it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="3.18">thing they&amp;#39;re raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re looking to raise the interest</text>
  <text start="211.85" dur="4.53">rates even further they know this is</text>
  <text start="213.77" dur="4.2">going to disrupt the economy because</text>
  <text start="216.38" dur="4.29">they kept it very very low before</text>
  <text start="217.97" dur="5.99">they&amp;#39;re unwinding at the same time I</text>
  <text start="220.67" dur="6.36">mean this spells disaster and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="223.96" dur="4.72">pretty much what&amp;#39;s going to happen if</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="3.96">they get their way it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="4.53">complete another disaster they will</text>
  <text start="230.99" dur="4.26">control the narrative they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="233.21" dur="3.63">blame whoever they need to blame they</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="2.73">can blame a country they complain the</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="5.64">president it makes no difference</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="9.3">whatsoever now we understand that on the</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="7.41">other side well we&amp;#39;re in this system the</text>
  <text start="247.28" dur="5.67">system is dead you really can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="249.89" dur="5.819">anything to get out of it now I know the</text>
  <text start="252.95" dur="5.61">corporate media the financial pun ins</text>
  <text start="255.709" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re out there and they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="258.56" dur="7.17">screaming and yelling because Trump is</text>
  <text start="261.109" dur="7.561">placing tariffs on steel now you need to</text>
  <text start="265.73" dur="7.32">think about this for a second the</text>
  <text start="268.67" dur="6.69">economy today cannot be sustained the</text>
  <text start="273.05" dur="5.07">debt levels are too high the real</text>
  <text start="275.36" dur="7.2">economy made up of the people has</text>
  <text start="278.12" dur="7.68">disintegrated 70% of GDP is made up of</text>
  <text start="282.56" dur="5.94">people spending their funds in retail it</text>
  <text start="285.8" dur="4.77">is not happening this is why GDP</text>
  <text start="288.5" dur="4.65">continually declines they had to</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="6.96">manipulate it just to get it into that</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="7.25">2% range they fudged the numbers just to</text>
  <text start="297.53" dur="7.29">get it where it is it&amp;#39;s much much lower</text>
  <text start="300.4" dur="8.01">so right now we have the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="6.06">out there the IMF is saying listen</text>
  <text start="308.41" dur="4.96">Trump&amp;#39;s plan to impose tariffs on steel</text>
  <text start="310.88" dur="5.39">in a loom aluminum would likely hurt</text>
  <text start="313.37" dur="5.28">both the US and the world economies and</text>
  <text start="316.27" dur="4.209">this would be a</text>
  <text start="318.65" dur="6.239">not a disaster now think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="320.479" dur="9.931">happening here the central banks they</text>
  <text start="324.889" dur="8.34">want to bring down the economy Trump he</text>
  <text start="330.41" dur="7.8">knows that this system is dead in the</text>
  <text start="333.229" dur="8.401">water what he&amp;#39;s doing now is not to help</text>
  <text start="338.21" dur="4.019">this economy out this economy is going</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="3.63">nowhere</text>
  <text start="342.229" dur="7.921">it needs a reboot it needs to be wiped</text>
  <text start="345.26" dur="8.879">out it needs to be cleansed so with him</text>
  <text start="350.15" dur="8.85">pushing forth this idea of tariffs on</text>
  <text start="354.139" dur="8.521">steel aluminum it&amp;#39;s not really to help</text>
  <text start="359" dur="6.9">America and there could be some</text>
  <text start="362.66" dur="4.62">underlying reasons why he&amp;#39;s doing this</text>
  <text start="365.9" dur="3.299">now I know a lot of people are gonna be</text>
  <text start="367.28" dur="3.54">out there saying oh my god you know</text>
  <text start="369.199" dur="4.801">these tariffs that&amp;#39;s gonna lead into war</text>
  <text start="370.82" dur="7.23">and so on and so forth yes we know that</text>
  <text start="374" dur="7.8">these type of trade wars end up in real</text>
  <text start="378.05" dur="6.45">wars but let&amp;#39;s go back in time you know</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="5.07">this is not the first time this happened</text>
  <text start="384.5" dur="6.63">this is how we got trade wars going into</text>
  <text start="386.87" dur="9.21">real wars bush george w bush we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="9.09">go back to 2002 of march well he decided</text>
  <text start="396.08" dur="8.55">to impose tariffs as high as 30 percent</text>
  <text start="400.22" dur="7.379">on global steel imports the temporary</text>
  <text start="404.63" dur="4.909">tariffs of 8 to 30 30 % were originally</text>
  <text start="407.599" dur="5.641">scheduled to remain into effect until</text>
  <text start="409.539" dur="6.31">2005 they were imposed to give us steel</text>
  <text start="413.24" dur="5.07">makers protection from what a us probe</text>
  <text start="415.849" dur="7.141">determined was a detrimental surge in</text>
  <text start="418.31" dur="7.02">steel imports as more than 30 steel</text>
  <text start="422.99" dur="4.98">makers had recently declared bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="425.33" dur="4.709">Canada Mexico were exempt from the</text>
  <text start="427.97" dur="3.71">towers because of penalties the United</text>
  <text start="430.039" dur="3.781">States would face under NAFTA</text>
  <text start="431.68" dur="4.359">additionally some developing countries</text>
  <text start="433.82" dur="5.76">such as Argentina Thailand and Turkey</text>
  <text start="436.039" dur="6.481">they were also exempt now on November 11</text>
  <text start="439.58" dur="5.399">2003 the World Trade Organization they</text>
  <text start="442.52" dur="5.07">came out against the steel tower saying</text>
  <text start="444.979" dur="7.141">that they had not been imposed during a</text>
  <text start="447.59" dur="6.63">period of import surge steel imports at</text>
  <text start="452.12" dur="5.43">actually dropped a bit during 2001 and</text>
  <text start="454.22" dur="5.52">2002 and that the tariffs therefore were</text>
  <text start="457.55" dur="5.339">a violation of America&amp;#39;s World Trade</text>
  <text start="459.74" dur="5.31">Organization tariff rate commitments the</text>
  <text start="462.889" dur="4.59">ruling authorized more than 2 billion in</text>
  <text start="465.05" dur="5.22">sanctions the largest penalty ever</text>
  <text start="467.479" dur="5.071">imposed by the World Trade Organisation</text>
  <text start="470.27" dur="5.73">against a member state now if the United</text>
  <text start="472.55" dur="5.88">States didn&amp;#39;t remove these tariffs they</text>
  <text start="476" dur="7.11">would have been sanctioned 2 billion</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="7.41">dollars but it was the markets response</text>
  <text start="483.11" dur="5.309">that broke the camel&amp;#39;s back</text>
  <text start="485.84" dur="4.47">what filed immediately after the tariffs</text>
  <text start="488.419" dur="7.141">were announced was a 30 percent plunge</text>
  <text start="490.31" dur="7.59">in the S&amp;amp;P 500 a slump in the dollar and</text>
  <text start="495.56" dur="5.94">a rally in bonds that slashed the</text>
  <text start="497.9" dur="7.769">10-year yields in half now let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="501.5" dur="7.919">about this the market plunged the dollar</text>
  <text start="505.669" dur="9.36">slumped and it looks like we were</text>
  <text start="509.419" dur="7.891">heading towards a disaster now the UN I</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="5.7">mean the World Trade Organization was</text>
  <text start="517.31" dur="6.419">going to impose sanctions the markets</text>
  <text start="520.729" dur="5.071">were crumbling and eventually what the</text>
  <text start="523.729" dur="3.991">United States did they back down and</text>
  <text start="525.8" dur="8.28">withdrew the tariffs on December 4th</text>
  <text start="527.72" dur="11.97">2003 well looking at this scenario by</text>
  <text start="534.08" dur="10.89">Trump implementing these tariffs this is</text>
  <text start="539.69" dur="6.269">a way to bring down the system because</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="4.17">we consider it ready</text>
  <text start="545.959" dur="6.301">he&amp;#39;s even pushing reciprocal taxes he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.14" dur="6.54">going all out right now he knows the</text>
  <text start="552.26" dur="7.829">central banking system is about to bring</text>
  <text start="555.68" dur="7.2">down the economy and it looks like he</text>
  <text start="560.089" dur="5.131">wants to control the narrative of the</text>
  <text start="562.88" dur="4.17">economy coming down instead of the</text>
  <text start="565.22" dur="8.13">central bank so what we have right now</text>
  <text start="567.05" dur="10.01">is that the entire system is being</text>
  <text start="573.35" dur="7.76">brought down by two different groups</text>
  <text start="577.06" dur="6.88">both trying to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="581.11" dur="4.659">because you know the tariffs they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="583.94" dur="5.569">going to help you know</text>
  <text start="585.769" dur="7.831">it states at all well they will help if</text>
  <text start="589.509" dur="6.37">the country is brought down declared</text>
  <text start="593.6" dur="3.149">bankruptcy like a corporation even</text>
  <text start="595.879" dur="2.61">though that&amp;#39;s not what he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="596.749" dur="5.31">but it&amp;#39;s almost the same type of thing</text>
  <text start="598.489" dur="7.53">and reset the whole thing he needs to</text>
  <text start="602.059" dur="6.27">build the case of why the system wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="606.019" dur="4.98">working in the first place and I think</text>
  <text start="608.329" dur="6.031">this is the first step of bringing down</text>
  <text start="610.999" dur="4.68">the system building a narrative to blame</text>
  <text start="614.36" dur="3">it on the central bank because I do</text>
  <text start="615.679" dur="3.931">believe and this is why he has Andrew</text>
  <text start="617.36" dur="5.009">Jackson hanging in the White House he</text>
  <text start="619.61" dur="5.49">wants to do what Andrew Jackson did get</text>
  <text start="622.369" dur="4.981">rid of the central bank now of course</text>
  <text start="625.1" dur="4.859">the central banks they don&amp;#39;t want to go</text>
  <text start="627.35" dur="6.329">anywhere and this is why we end up in</text>
  <text start="629.959" dur="10.53">wars so you can see how this all comes</text>
  <text start="633.679" dur="9.06">about when a president an entity within</text>
  <text start="640.489" dur="5.01">government that&amp;#39;s not elected goes up</text>
  <text start="642.739" dur="8.1">against the central bank the central</text>
  <text start="645.499" dur="8.041">bank pushes events they push Wars they</text>
  <text start="650.839" dur="4.771">push whatever they need to to stop this</text>
  <text start="653.54" dur="6.509">from happening and that&amp;#39;s how we</text>
  <text start="655.61" dur="9.209">actually get into Wars and we see right</text>
  <text start="660.049" dur="6.75">now that the push is on now again this</text>
  <text start="664.819" dur="4.5">transition that we&amp;#39;re heading towards</text>
  <text start="666.799" dur="4.111">can go either way and go with the</text>
  <text start="669.319" dur="4.89">central bank&amp;#39;s if they can control the</text>
  <text start="670.91" dur="6.359">narrative it will be their transition we</text>
  <text start="674.209" dur="7.23">will still be serving the central</text>
  <text start="677.269" dur="6.51">bankers if the central bankers don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="681.439" dur="4.44">control the narrative and Trump has the</text>
  <text start="683.779" dur="4.261">ability to do so and blame it on the</text>
  <text start="685.879" dur="3.75">central bankers I do believe we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="688.04" dur="4.129">going in the direction of the</text>
  <text start="689.629" dur="5.43">cryptocurrencies in some form or another</text>
  <text start="692.169" dur="6.241">and we could see already that Germany</text>
  <text start="695.059" dur="8.25">the German Federal Ministry of Finance&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="698.41" dur="7.599">has considered Bitcoin as tax-exempt so</text>
  <text start="703.309" dur="4.981">long as it is used as a means of payment</text>
  <text start="706.009" dur="5.49">the German federal authority published</text>
  <text start="708.29" dur="4.279">its decision to not subject purchases</text>
  <text start="711.499" dur="4.65">with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="712.569" dur="6.161">to taxes on February 27 citing the</text>
  <text start="716.149" dur="3.121">European courts 2015 decision which set</text>
  <text start="718.73" dur="2.88">a</text>
  <text start="719.27" dur="4.74">Siddhant for all members of the European</text>
  <text start="721.61" dur="4.11">Union the court justified its tax</text>
  <text start="724.01" dur="4.23">decision by stating that it considers</text>
  <text start="725.72" dur="6.51">cryptocurrencies as a legal means of</text>
  <text start="728.24" dur="6.69">payment now compared to the IRS the IRS</text>
  <text start="732.23" dur="5.01">treats Bitcoin like property meaning</text>
  <text start="734.93" dur="4.5">that each purchase using Bitcoin is</text>
  <text start="737.24" dur="4.47">technically considered to be a sale of</text>
  <text start="739.43" dur="5.52">property and is therefore subject to</text>
  <text start="741.71" dur="6.29">capital gains tax so we see the very big</text>
  <text start="744.95" dur="6.66">difference here we also see another</text>

  <text start="751.61" dur="4.35">Mark Carney he said something very</text>
  <text start="754.43" dur="3.96">interesting about cryptocurrencies and</text>
  <text start="755.96" dur="4.77">if you notice it&amp;#39;s the same theme with</text>
  <text start="758.39" dur="5.13">all these individuals that are hooked</text>
  <text start="760.73" dur="5.25">into the central banking system even</text>
  <text start="763.52" dur="4.26">minuchin who is in the Treasury is</text>
  <text start="765.98" dur="3.42">saying the same thing about</text>
  <text start="767.78" dur="3.69">cryptocurrencies because he&amp;#39;s a Goldman</text>
  <text start="769.4" dur="5.52">Sachs boy and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="771.47" dur="7.08">that he is tied in with the central</text>
  <text start="774.92" dur="6.3">banking system now Carney is out there</text>
  <text start="778.55" dur="5.79">and he is saying that crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="781.22" dur="6.09">such as Bitcoin are full are failing as</text>
  <text start="784.34" dur="5.34">a form of money and have shown clear</text>
  <text start="787.31" dur="5.34">signs of being a financial bubble</text>
  <text start="789.68" dur="4.56">well central bankers they do know what a</text>
  <text start="792.65" dur="4.53">financial bubble is because they do</text>
  <text start="794.24" dur="4.59">create them but their technology could</text>
  <text start="797.18" dur="2.55">improve the financial system in the</text>
  <text start="798.83" dur="3.9">future</text>
  <text start="799.73" dur="5.76">but right now it&amp;#39;s not good it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="802.73" dur="4.8">used as a digital currency it&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="805.49" dur="5.07">there right now and we shouldn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="807.53" dur="5.04">look at it right now Facebook banned</text>
  <text start="810.56" dur="3.51">advertisements of cryptocurrencies they</text>
  <text start="812.57" dur="5.34">started this last month we mentioned</text>
  <text start="814.07" dur="5.76">this and we see right now that he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="817.91" dur="4.86">there saying that you know the typical</text>
  <text start="819.83" dur="5.37">everyday investor doesn&amp;#39;t realize that</text>
  <text start="822.77" dur="4.23">you know Bitcoin and the other</text>
  <text start="825.2" dur="5.4">cryptocurrencies there in this gigantic</text>
  <text start="827" dur="7.23">bubble and it&amp;#39;s the same thing that led</text>
  <text start="830.6" dur="5.88">the markets into the 2007 2000 financial</text>
  <text start="834.23" dur="4.92">crisis actually it was the central banks</text>
  <text start="836.48" dur="4.98">that did this they created the bubbles</text>
  <text start="839.15" dur="4.23">and of course they said they can&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="841.46" dur="3.75">bubbles it&amp;#39;s amazing the central bankers</text>
  <text start="843.38" dur="3.69">are out there and they say they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="845.21" dur="5.82">see bubbles they can&amp;#39;t detect bubbles</text>
  <text start="847.07" dur="6.06">but they know cryptocurrency is in a</text>
  <text start="851.03" dur="3.3">bubble I mean</text>
  <text start="853.13" dur="4.68">about this for a second what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="854.33" dur="6.12">saying with their system it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="857.81" dur="5.07">to detect a financial bubble it they</text>
  <text start="860.45" dur="5.67">just don&amp;#39;t exist but we can spot them</text>
  <text start="862.88" dur="5.58">anywhere else I mean really I mean this</text>
  <text start="866.12" dur="4.92">is what they&amp;#39;re trying to push out there</text>
  <text start="868.46" dur="5.82">the propaganda is getting so bad and</text>
  <text start="871.04" dur="6.45">it&amp;#39;s really fallen by the wayside here</text>
  <text start="874.28" dur="6.78">it doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense anymore so</text>
  <text start="877.49" dur="6.51">here we are right now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="881.06" dur="5.46">take down of the economy has officially</text>
  <text start="884" dur="4.56">begun and we can already see it in the</text>
  <text start="886.52" dur="3.18">markets I mean they are tanking right</text>
  <text start="888.56" dur="3.3">now doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re gonna be pushed</text>
  <text start="889.7" dur="4.44">up remember the markets are manipulated</text>
  <text start="891.86" dur="4.79">but when things get out of control the</text>
  <text start="894.14" dur="5.19">manipulation falls by the wayside and</text>
  <text start="896.65" dur="5.41">everything just starts to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="899.33" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re already starting to see that</text>
  <text start="902.06" dur="4.59">falling apart now we have two entities</text>
  <text start="904.28" dur="4.26">right now trying to bring down the</text>
  <text start="906.65" dur="5.15">system we know because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="908.54" dur="7.41">tracking the system this system is a</text>
  <text start="911.8" dur="5.2">system that has died already it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="915.95" dur="5.13">that it is dying</text>
  <text start="917" dur="6.15">it has died already and they understand</text>
  <text start="921.08" dur="4.08">and they know that there&amp;#39;s nowhere to go</text>
  <text start="923.15" dur="4.8">with this system you can&amp;#39;t raise</text>
  <text start="925.16" dur="5.97">interest rates now I mean we mitten at</text>
  <text start="927.95" dur="7.05">0% Europe and many other areas are a</text>
  <text start="931.13" dur="5.1">negative percentage and you can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="935" dur="3.78">anywhere because if you start bringing</text>
  <text start="936.23" dur="3.63">them up guess what happens let&amp;#39;s see we</text>
  <text start="938.78" dur="3.3">have a problem in the student loan</text>
  <text start="939.86" dur="4.62">industry we have a problem in the</text>
  <text start="942.08" dur="4.59">automobile industry we have a problem in</text>
  <text start="944.48" dur="4.17">the housing industry we have a problem</text>
  <text start="946.67" dur="5.84">with credit cards with people paying</text>
  <text start="948.65" dur="6.93">back debt once the rates go up</text>
  <text start="952.51" dur="6.61">everything falls apart because when</text>
  <text start="955.58" dur="5.85">you&amp;#39;re at the end stage and you&amp;#39;re at 0%</text>
  <text start="959.12" dur="5.28">interest rates and you start raising the</text>
  <text start="961.43" dur="6.83">rates all of these things that are</text>
  <text start="964.4" dur="7.86">attached to debt start to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="968.26" dur="8.23">you can&amp;#39;t raise the rates because wages</text>
  <text start="972.26" dur="8.97">are continually falling and what that</text>
  <text start="976.49" dur="7.5">means is as wages are falling and rates</text>
  <text start="981.23" dur="5.34">are moving up how are people going to</text>
  <text start="983.99" dur="4.94">make payments if you go</text>
  <text start="986.57" dur="5.39">back to the beginning of the system</text>
  <text start="988.93" dur="6.21">salaries were increasing dramatically</text>
  <text start="991.96" dur="7">there was huge amount of inflation</text>
  <text start="995.14" dur="7.48">interest rates were high you are getting</text>
  <text start="998.96" dur="6.69">an incredible return on your CDs wages</text>
  <text start="1002.62" dur="4.53">were keeping up with what was going on</text>
  <text start="1005.65" dur="3.54">because we were coming off the gold</text>
  <text start="1007.15" dur="3.93">standard they were printing a lot of</text>
  <text start="1009.19" dur="3.24">dollars and this was the beginning of</text>
  <text start="1011.08" dur="3.75">the system there wasn&amp;#39;t that much debt</text>
  <text start="1012.43" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re at the opposite end right now and</text>
  <text start="1014.83" dur="5.25">you can see the effects and you can see</text>
  <text start="1017.89" dur="3.63">what is happening now back then when the</text>
  <text start="1020.08" dur="3.33">rates went up they had to do that to</text>
  <text start="1021.52" dur="3.39">counter everything but then they in the</text>
  <text start="1023.41" dur="4.049">eighties they were able to bring the</text>
  <text start="1024.91" dur="5.4">rates down and everyone felt incredible</text>
  <text start="1027.459" dur="5.88">because your wages went up interest</text>
  <text start="1030.31" dur="6.48">rates dropped which made payments a lot</text>
  <text start="1033.339" dur="7.5">less which made people the ability to</text>
  <text start="1036.79" dur="7.35">afford automobiles the ability to afford</text>
  <text start="1040.839" dur="5.881">homes the ability to go back to school</text>
  <text start="1044.14" dur="4.89">the ability to do a lot of different</text>
  <text start="1046.72" dur="4.32">things it freed up a lot of credit where</text>
  <text start="1049.03" dur="4.38">people were now able to take out credit</text>
  <text start="1051.04" dur="6.66">and spend money they really didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1053.41" dur="7.11">and of course back then a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1057.7" dur="5.73">didn&amp;#39;t have that much debt so this was</text>
  <text start="1060.52" dur="5.04">the beginning of their system we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="1063.43" dur="4.65">the opposite end the debt levels of</text>
  <text start="1065.56" dur="4.53">people are so high right now the wages</text>
  <text start="1068.08" dur="4.47">are dropping the interest rates are at</text>
  <text start="1070.09" dur="6.27">the lowest point if they start raising</text>
  <text start="1072.55" dur="6.03">them wages are still declining payments</text>
  <text start="1076.36" dur="5.13">will go up credit card payments will go</text>
  <text start="1078.58" dur="6.51">up people already have a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="1081.49" dur="5.91">debt and not not much in savings so that</text>
  <text start="1085.09" dur="4.89">right there is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="1087.4" dur="7.32">disaster this is why the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1089.98" dur="8.28">this is why Trump this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1094.72" dur="5.58">both bringing down the system they want</text>
  <text start="1098.26" dur="4.2">to control the narrative when it comes</text>
  <text start="1100.3" dur="6.72">down and we can see they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="1102.46" dur="6.78">pushing their agendas and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1107.02" dur="4.47">just a matter of time I think it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1109.24" dur="4.77">to be pushed even harder and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1111.49" dur="4.71">gonna go at it and they&amp;#39;re both gonna</text>
  <text start="1114.01" dur="5.81">try to bring it down and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1116.2" dur="3.62">have to see who wins and remember</text>
  <text start="1119.87" dur="7.32">the market is manipulated and every time</text>
  <text start="1123.71" dur="5.9">the market drops it is pushed back up</text>
  <text start="1127.19" dur="5.13">depending on which faction is doing it</text>
  <text start="1129.61" dur="4.78">because they all have their hands in the</text>
  <text start="1132.32" dur="5.25">market they all have the ability to</text>
  <text start="1134.39" dur="6.12">control it it&amp;#39;s not like just one has</text>
  <text start="1137.57" dur="5.7">the ability they all have the ability so</text>
