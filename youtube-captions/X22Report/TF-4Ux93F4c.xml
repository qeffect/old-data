  <text start="78.28" dur="6.36">watching wages decline since the</text>
  <text start="81.1" dur="6.03">recession of 2008-2009 and we never</text>
  <text start="84.64" dur="5.039">really recovered from the recession all</text>
  <text start="87.13" dur="4.92">they did was create this gigantic</text>
  <text start="89.679" dur="3.631">illusion which kept us in the dark most</text>
  <text start="92.05" dur="3.629">of the people in the dark unless people</text>
  <text start="93.31" dur="4.26">you know peel back the layers and look</text>
  <text start="95.679" dur="3.871">inside and saw what was really going on</text>
  <text start="97.57" dur="4.469">and they realized that they were</text>
  <text start="99.55" dur="4.53">fabricating a lot of the data and they</text>
  <text start="102.039" dur="3.87">were telling us lies just like they did</text>
  <text start="104.08" dur="3.989">prior to 2008 when they told us that</text>
  <text start="105.909" dur="3.75">subprime securities we&amp;#39;re all triple-a</text>
  <text start="108.069" dur="3.75">everything&amp;#39;s fine nothing to worry about</text>

  <text start="112.45" dur="3.779">everything is just absolutely perfect</text>
  <text start="114.25" dur="4.38">and of course when at once everything</text>
  <text start="116.229" dur="5.101">came crashing down we found out the</text>
  <text start="118.63" dur="4.62">truth they were lying to the public they</text>
  <text start="121.33" dur="4.649">even lied when they had to bail out all</text>
  <text start="123.25" dur="5.58">these corporations they lied and they</text>
  <text start="125.979" dur="5.251">lied and they lied well they told us</text>
  <text start="128.83" dur="3.96">that wages were starting to increase</text>
  <text start="131.23" dur="4.29">things were gonna be getting better and</text>
  <text start="132.79" dur="5.309">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now for the</text>
  <text start="135.52" dur="5.07">first time since November of 2009 real</text>
  <text start="138.099" dur="5.581">average hourly earnings tumbled for the</text>
  <text start="140.59" dur="5.31">fourth month in a row and despite all</text>
  <text start="143.68" dur="5.43">the hype all the hope and all the</text>
  <text start="145.9" dur="6.449">Phillips curve academic discussion</text>
  <text start="149.11" dur="6.68">it looks like wages are continually</text>
  <text start="152.349" dur="8.371">declining real earnings growth is</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="7.15">declining it&amp;#39;s just not there and here</text>
  <text start="160.72" dur="5.61">we are once again and if we go back to</text>
  <text start="162.94" dur="8.85">the Great Recession real average hourly</text>
  <text start="166.33" dur="10.25">earnings urine year plummeted in 2008</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="10.14">going into 2009 and it did plummet from</text>
  <text start="176.58" dur="7.09">2007 going into 2008 and it was pushed</text>
  <text start="181.93" dur="4.88">back up and then it dropped again and</text>
  <text start="183.67" dur="5.78">it&amp;#39;s been hovering around</text>
  <text start="186.81" dur="5.28">zero ever since and here we are</text>
  <text start="189.45" dur="6.09">approaching zero once again and we can</text>
  <text start="192.09" dur="5.85">see at this point in time that the wages</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="4.8">that people are receiving is continually</text>
  <text start="197.94" dur="4.65">declining now but government is</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="4.35">continually coming out and of course the</text>
  <text start="202.59" dur="4.05">statistical department&amp;#39;s the BLS and the</text>
  <text start="204.69" dur="3.27">rest are telling us how great the</text>
  <text start="206.64" dur="3.39">economy is doing then they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="207.96" dur="3.33">this since the Great Recession now this</text>
  <text start="210.03" dur="3.78">was all part of the plan to make</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="5.52">everyone believe that the economy was</text>
  <text start="213.81" dur="5.82">doing well and they continued this</text>
  <text start="216.81" dur="6.69">practice even when Trump was inaugurated</text>
  <text start="219.63" dur="5.91">as president it has not changed actually</text>
  <text start="223.5" dur="4.26">if you look at what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="225.54" dur="4.14">they actually accelerated the process</text>
  <text start="227.76" dur="3.21">where they&amp;#39;re telling us that things are</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="3.09">a lot better than they really are and</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="5.33">people are really starting to believe</text>
  <text start="232.77" dur="5.4">this this is where it gets scary now</text>
  <text start="236.3" dur="5.439">about a month ago</text>
  <text start="238.17" dur="6.18">UBS shattered shattered the narrative of</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="6.301">the surging GDP by showing just one</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="5.88">chart which revealed that excluding</text>
  <text start="248.04" dur="4.44">contributions from energy investment</text>
  <text start="250.23" dur="4.5">which are about to hit a brick wall now</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="5.039">that the price of oil has peaked and is</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="6.08">reverting lower once again US growth for</text>
  <text start="257.519" dur="5.9">the past two years has been slowing and</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="6.13">if we look at this we can see that yes</text>
  <text start="263.419" dur="6.671">GDP numbers have been fake now think</text>
  <text start="266.94" dur="6">about this do you remember when the US</text>
  <text start="270.09" dur="4.62">was blanketed by deep snow when every</text>
  <text start="272.94" dur="3.21">expert was rushing to convince those who</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="3.69">bothered to listen that the economy</text>
  <text start="276.15" dur="4.23">which suffer a sharp slowdown as a</text>
  <text start="278.4" dur="3.93">result of weather and they just kept on</text>
  <text start="280.38" dur="4.14">saying yes this is why the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="3.899">declining this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="2.97">is why it&amp;#39;s happening and of course we</text>
  <text start="286.229" dur="1.891">reported that this had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="287.49" dur="2.52">with the weather</text>
  <text start="288.12" dur="2.94">because the weather only hits in certain</text>
  <text start="290.01" dur="4.32">parts of the country the rest of the</text>
  <text start="291.06" dur="5.46">country is fine but they went on to try</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="3.81">to convince everyone that it was the</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="4.53">weather if you go back to 2015 the first</text>
  <text start="298.14" dur="5.67">quarter they showed that yes ooh look we</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="5.25">had problems and GDP came in at 0.2</text>
  <text start="303.81" dur="4.68">percent and then they revised the</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="5.22">numbers and they kept on revising the</text>
  <text start="308.49" dur="4.23">numbers all along now when we really</text>
  <text start="311.52" dur="3.75">look at this and we look at the growth</text>
  <text start="312.72" dur="4.74">we can see that they had so many</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="3.48">different numbers now during that year</text>
  <text start="317.46" dur="2.36">in the beginning of the year actually in</text>
  <text start="318.75" dur="3.23">December</text>
  <text start="319.82" dur="4.41">14 they said the economy was going to be</text>
  <text start="321.98" dur="3.72">growing at 3.2 percent now of course</text>
  <text start="324.23" dur="3.57">they always throw out these numbers at</text>
  <text start="325.7" dur="3.36">the end of the year going into the next</text>
  <text start="327.8" dur="3.09">year saying it&amp;#39;s gonna be growing at 3%</text>
  <text start="329.06" dur="5.52">that&amp;#39;s pretty much where they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="330.89" dur="5.55">app and these GDP numbers that come in</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="4.88">at the beginning of the year coming at</text>
  <text start="336.44" dur="6.27">point 2 percent negative 0.7 percent and</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="6.64">they rican tin you li revise the numbers</text>
  <text start="342.71" dur="5.58">over and over and over again now if you</text>
  <text start="346.1" dur="4.05">really look at it it came in at like</text>
  <text start="348.29" dur="3.84">negative 0.7 and what they did is they</text>
  <text start="350.15" dur="5.52">went through revisions like in April May</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="6.21">June July and - actually they kept doing</text>
  <text start="355.67" dur="6.72">it to get the numbers where they wanted</text>
  <text start="358.34" dur="6.33">where they wanted them to be and what</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;ve done here is they continue this</text>
  <text start="364.67" dur="5.19">practice moving forward where they just</text>
  <text start="368.48" dur="3.12">go back in time and they continually</text>
  <text start="369.86" dur="4.08">revise the numbers to make everyone</text>
  <text start="371.6" dur="3.3">believe that the economy&amp;#39;s doing a lot</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="3.39">better than it really is</text>
  <text start="374.9" dur="5.01">now of course which number is the truth</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="4.77">well if you strip away all these</text>
  <text start="379.91" dur="5.19">revisions and you go to John Williams</text>
  <text start="382.1" dur="5.55">with his calculation it shows that the</text>
  <text start="385.1" dur="5.94">GDP numbers have always been around zero</text>
  <text start="387.65" dur="7.05">or negative nothing has really been</text>
  <text start="391.04" dur="5.57">better than that and what has been</text>
  <text start="394.7" dur="5.94">happening is they&amp;#39;ve been stripping away</text>
  <text start="396.61" dur="6.34">all different things out of GDP to make</text>
  <text start="400.64" dur="3.63">it look a lot better than it is and they</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="5.85">just move it around from quarter to</text>
  <text start="404.27" dur="7.71">quarter now what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="408.8" dur="6.12">that all these cysts achill</text>
  <text start="411.98" dur="6.81">manipulations they are coming to an end</text>
  <text start="414.92" dur="6.78">because what happens is when when an</text>
  <text start="418.79" dur="5.31">economy deteriorates when it collapses</text>
  <text start="421.7" dur="4.53">the real economy the people&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="424.1" dur="4.17">that goes first and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="426.23" dur="3.42">been seeing it doesn&amp;#39;t happen overnight</text>
  <text start="428.27" dur="4.02">everyone goes all you&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="429.65" dur="3.54">about the collapse of the economy well</text>
  <text start="432.29" dur="4.74">think about it</text>
  <text start="433.19" dur="7.2">it takes the central bank&amp;#39;s a very long</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="6.54">time to pump it up I mean we were in a</text>
  <text start="440.39" dur="5.52">Great Recession in 2008-2009 they needed</text>
  <text start="443.57" dur="4.68">to create an illusion and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="445.91" dur="3.93">happen overnight they need to pump it up</text>
  <text start="448.25" dur="2.97">they need to gain confidence this is</text>
  <text start="449.84" dur="4">what they love to do</text>
  <text start="451.22" dur="5.08">they love to trick everyone</text>
  <text start="453.84" dur="5.19">into thinking the economy is strong and</text>
  <text start="456.3" dur="5.7">you can&amp;#39;t do this in a year or two years</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="6.15">it takes a long time for them to pump up</text>
  <text start="462" dur="6.18">the bubbles once again this recession</text>
  <text start="465.18" dur="5.67">that we were in was horrific</text>
  <text start="468.18" dur="5.1">there were many areas where they had to</text>
  <text start="470.85" dur="5.01">pump the bubbles up they had to gain</text>
  <text start="473.28" dur="5.1">control and manipulate everything to</text>
  <text start="475.86" dur="6.18">convince you the economy was doing well</text>
  <text start="478.38" dur="5.73">and here we are today and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="482.04" dur="6.18">the same exact thing that they did prior</text>
  <text start="484.11" dur="5.76">to 2008 they have fooled most of the</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="4.05">American public except the people that</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="5.01">have been listening to the x-22 report</text>
  <text start="492.27" dur="5.07">and many other alternative media sites</text>
  <text start="494.88" dur="3.99">where we&amp;#39;ve been tracking what has been</text>
  <text start="497.34" dur="4.65">happening in a few notice if</text>
  <text start="498.87" dur="8.51">unemployment has dropped a four point</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="9.12">one percent we would see an explosion in</text>
  <text start="507.38" dur="6.82">real estate we would see an explosion in</text>
  <text start="511.11" dur="5.4">the retail market we would see an</text>
  <text start="514.2" dur="5.269">explosion everywhere we would see Corp</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="5.37">we would say federal tax receipts</text>
  <text start="519.469" dur="2.95">explode because everyone has full-time</text>
  <text start="521.88" dur="2.43">jobs</text>
  <text start="522.419" dur="3.871">everyone&amp;#39;s making money everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="4.11">paying taxes we&amp;#39;re not saying it</text>
  <text start="526.29" dur="5.669">same thing with its set with the state</text>
  <text start="528.42" dur="8.669">tax receipts it&amp;#39;s not happening that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.959" dur="7.711">the real proof now the Fed they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="537.089" dur="6.361">using fake inflationary numbers all</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="6.78">along and they&amp;#39;ve been doing this to</text>
  <text start="543.45" dur="5.009">pretend that the economy is seeing no</text>
  <text start="546.45" dur="3.75">inflation of course they they moved it</text>
  <text start="548.459" dur="3.961">overseas into the stock market into the</text>
  <text start="550.2" dur="4.59">housing market and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="552.42" dur="5.34">right now is the Fed has raised the</text>
  <text start="554.79" dur="6.27">interest rates from one point two five</text>
  <text start="557.76" dur="6.21">percent to one point five percent now</text>
  <text start="561.06" dur="5.94">this is the short-term interest rate now</text>
  <text start="563.97" dur="7.28">they are slowly moving this up now this</text>
  <text start="567" dur="8.13">is the fifth time that they&amp;#39;ve done this</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="6.43">since 2015 does the first time was in</text>
  <text start="575.13" dur="5.07">December of 2015 when they did this now</text>
  <text start="577.68" dur="5.22">throughout this time period the Fed has</text>
  <text start="580.2" dur="5.82">routinely stated that it is confused as</text>
  <text start="582.9" dur="5.37">to why inflation is so low</text>
  <text start="586.02" dur="4.86">well if you look at the real models of</text>
  <text start="588.27" dur="5.16">detecting inflation and figuring and</text>
  <text start="590.88" dur="5.61">calculating inflation inflation is not</text>
  <text start="593.43" dur="5.099">low inflation is actually very high you</text>
  <text start="596.49" dur="4.26">can see it in many different areas the</text>
  <text start="598.529" dur="4.56">premiums of insurance you can see it in</text>
  <text start="600.75" dur="4.05">food in the stores you can see it in</text>
  <text start="603.089" dur="4.891">restaurants as they keep raising their</text>
  <text start="604.8" dur="5.01">prices you can see it in college tuition</text>
  <text start="607.98" dur="5.88">you can see it in different places this</text>
  <text start="609.81" dur="8.089">is the hint of what inflation is really</text>
  <text start="613.86" dur="7.05">doing and what is happening right now is</text>
  <text start="617.899" dur="5.321">that the the method the Fed uses to</text>
  <text start="620.91" dur="5.67">measure inflation is intentionally</text>
  <text start="623.22" dur="5.4">incorrect as a result the official</text>
  <text start="626.58" dur="4.65">inflation numbers reflect whatever the</text>
  <text start="628.62" dur="5.67">Fed wants as opposed to what is</text>
  <text start="631.23" dur="5.669">happening in reality now Alan Greenspan</text>
  <text start="634.29" dur="5.01">divides the entire gimme back in the 90s</text>
  <text start="636.899" dur="3.901">at that point the amount of debt in the</text>
  <text start="639.3" dur="5.55">u.s. financial had already become a</text>
  <text start="640.8" dur="6.15">systemic issue so Greenspan opted to</text>
  <text start="644.85" dur="4.29">paper over this fact via inflation</text>
  <text start="646.95" dur="4.46">hoping that by aggressively devaluing</text>
  <text start="649.14" dur="4.05">the US dollar he could keep the game</text>
  <text start="651.41" dur="4.06">moving along here</text>
  <text start="653.19" dur="4.11">the only problem as far as the Fed was</text>
  <text start="655.47" dur="3.989">concerned was that inflation numbers</text>
  <text start="657.3" dur="4.529">would reveal the Fed strategy so</text>
  <text start="659.459" dur="5.101">Greenspan started tinkering with how the</text>
  <text start="661.829" dur="4.771">Fed measured inflation removing various</text>
  <text start="664.56" dur="3.87">components like food and energy tweaking</text>
  <text start="666.6" dur="3.27">things so the Fed would no longer</text>
  <text start="668.43" dur="4.46">measure the cost of maintaining the same</text>
  <text start="669.87" dur="5.7">quality of life Greenspan hoped</text>
  <text start="672.89" dur="5.11">understating inflation publicly he would</text>
  <text start="675.57" dur="4.769">give him the cover he needed to pursue</text>
  <text start="678" dur="4.56">an aggressive devaluation of the US</text>
