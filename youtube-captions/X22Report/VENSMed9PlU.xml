  <text start="58.6" dur="7.199">episode 1627 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="62.53" dur="6.15">31st 2018 and the top of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.799" dur="6.271">the entire system is imploding and there</text>
  <text start="68.68" dur="6.27">is only one fix let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="72.07" dur="5.52">economic collapse financial news now a</text>
  <text start="74.95" dur="5.309">couple years ago Greece ran into a</text>
  <text start="77.59" dur="5.54">problem and they elected a new leader</text>
  <text start="80.259" dur="5.64">this new leader at tsipras supposed to</text>
  <text start="83.13" dur="5.739">basically go up against the central</text>
  <text start="85.899" dur="6.451">bankers didn&amp;#39;t really happen and Greece</text>
  <text start="88.869" dur="5.31">took on more debt and the IMF was out</text>
  <text start="92.35" dur="4.68">there that you was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="94.179" dur="5.55">the problems of Greece have been solved</text>
  <text start="97.03" dur="6.149">now the IMF is warning that the Greek</text>
  <text start="99.729" dur="7.14">debt is unsustainable right now without</text>
  <text start="103.179" dur="6.601">more debt relief measures Greece could</text>
  <text start="106.869" dur="5.28">struggle to maintain market access over</text>
  <text start="109.78" dur="6.21">the long run and what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="112.149" dur="5.28">that they&amp;#39;re projecting by 2022 which I</text>
  <text start="115.99" dur="4.59">believe is going to be much much sooner</text>
  <text start="117.429" dur="5.371">than that Greece is going to run in into</text>
  <text start="120.58" dur="4.59">another problem and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="122.8" dur="4.409">before now we need to remember that the</text>
  <text start="125.17" dur="5.13">central bank they don&amp;#39;t solve the</text>
  <text start="127.209" dur="5.61">problems they&amp;#39;d like you in debt they</text>
  <text start="130.3" dur="6.21">like the country to be in debt now they</text>
  <text start="132.819" dur="5.881">don&amp;#39;t want the country to default they</text>
  <text start="136.51" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t want the country to sink they like</text>
  <text start="138.7" dur="4.32">the country to be in that limbo state</text>
  <text start="140.95" dur="4.32">where they need to continually take on</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="4.2">debt and take on debt what do they have</text>
  <text start="145.27" dur="3.54">to push they&amp;#39;d have to push austerity</text>
  <text start="147.22" dur="3.269">they&amp;#39;d have to cut programs they have to</text>
  <text start="148.81" dur="3.96">do whatever they possibly can so they</text>
  <text start="150.489" dur="4.381">can take on that debt and this is what</text>
  <text start="152.77" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing and Greece once again</text>
  <text start="154.87" dur="4.259">is going to be running into that problem</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="4.289">because when we look at the whole</text>
  <text start="159.129" dur="7.321">central bank whole central bankers model</text>
  <text start="161.739" dur="7.021">we see that it&amp;#39;s continually working in</text>
  <text start="166.45" dur="4.2">this way where they put countries into</text>
  <text start="168.76" dur="3.72">debt they bail them out a little bit</text>
  <text start="170.65" dur="3.54">with more debt they say everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.48" dur="4.2">solved and a couple years later the same</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="5.61">thing happens again it&amp;#39;s a pattern and</text>
  <text start="176.68" dur="5.58">they know this most of the other people</text>
  <text start="179.8" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t know this country&amp;#39;s they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="182.26" dur="4.17">figure this out leaders they&amp;#39;re bought</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="3.03">and paid for and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="186.43" dur="3.779">doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="6.33">the only way around this is to get rid</text>
  <text start="190.209" dur="7.041">of what the central banking system the</text>
  <text start="193.84" dur="7.83">economy right now in the u.s. in the EU</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="6.97">in Canada in Australia it is completely</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="3.659">imploding on itself and we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="204.22" dur="3.48">all these different indicators like</text>
  <text start="205.329" dur="3.75">housing we&amp;#39;re looking at GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="207.7" dur="2.7">we&amp;#39;re looking at all these different</text>
  <text start="209.079" dur="2.58">things and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the economy</text>
  <text start="210.4" dur="3.39">is not improving whatsoever and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="211.659" dur="4.341">talking about the global economy when we</text>
  <text start="213.79" dur="4.83">look at the debt we can see the debt</text>
  <text start="216" dur="4.87">completely unsustainable it cannot be</text>
  <text start="218.62" dur="4.709">sustained at all if we look here in the</text>
  <text start="220.87" dur="5.119">United States we&amp;#39;ve been following new</text>
  <text start="223.329" dur="5.28">home sales existing home sales and</text>
  <text start="225.989" dur="5.681">they&amp;#39;re all declining pending home sales</text>
  <text start="228.609" dur="4.97">they are declining this is the summer</text>
  <text start="231.67" dur="4.11">months this is the hottest time now and</text>
  <text start="233.579" dur="4.03">everything is starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="4.349">Case Shiller is out there and this is</text>
  <text start="237.609" dur="5.19">their 20-city composite remember what</text>
  <text start="240.129" dur="6.061">they&amp;#39;ve done they&amp;#39;ve taken 20 cities</text>
  <text start="242.799" dur="6.381">they&amp;#39;ve had hedge funds and investment</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="6.409">companies purchase homes drive up prices</text>
  <text start="249.18" dur="7.869">interest rates came very very low and</text>
  <text start="252.599" dur="7.241">they made it look like we had a housing</text>
  <text start="257.049" dur="5.461">boom once again by pushing the prices up</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="4.889">because when prices of homes move up</text>
  <text start="262.51" dur="4.89">people feel comfortable like oh look on</text>
  <text start="264.729" dur="4.111">paper look how much I made I feel good</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="4.949">let me take a home equity line of credit</text>
  <text start="268.84" dur="6.389">out let me go purchase some goods this</text>
  <text start="272.349" dur="5.491">is what they tried to do once again but</text>
  <text start="275.229" dur="6.271">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a problem it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="7.1">happening in Australia Europe Canada and</text>
  <text start="281.5" dur="7.56">it is happening in the United States</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="7.78">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a slowdown in home</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="6.81">price appreciation this is according to</text>
  <text start="292.72" dur="6.78">Case Shiller we reported on this a while</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="6.18">back we noticed that we&amp;#39;ve hit the top</text>
  <text start="299.5" dur="4.65">where we were back in 2008 actually were</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="4.92">above that and now we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="304.15" dur="6.48">the prices of homes start to fall and</text>
  <text start="306.97" dur="7.47">when we look at this we can see that the</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="5.969">prices there coming down and this is not</text>
  <text start="314.44" dur="4.44">a good sign whatsoever because what</text>
  <text start="316.599" dur="3.93">happens when prices come down welp all</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="2.879">those individuals that have been</text>
  <text start="320.529" dur="3.06">purchasing their homes at the height of</text>
  <text start="321.759" dur="4.59">the market like in Canada</text>
  <text start="323.589" dur="6.32">I&amp;#39;m Australia in the United States well</text>
  <text start="326.349" dur="7.89">their mortgages are set at that high</text>
  <text start="329.909" dur="6.01">price when the price comes down well</text>
  <text start="334.239" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re going to be underwater they</text>
  <text start="335.919" dur="3.96">won&amp;#39;t be able to get rid of their houses</text>
  <text start="337.509" dur="4.65">those people in 2008 that bought at the</text>
  <text start="339.879" dur="4.88">height of the market they&amp;#39;re still stuck</text>
  <text start="342.159" dur="5.55">and this is just gonna make it worse and</text>
  <text start="344.759" dur="4.36">it&amp;#39;s not going to improve as time goes</text>
  <text start="347.709" dur="3.87">on now a lot of these individuals might</text>
  <text start="349.119" dur="5.19">have a short sell we&amp;#39;ve seen it before</text>
  <text start="351.579" dur="5.01">and the biggest areas right now that</text>
  <text start="354.309" dur="6.09">we&amp;#39;re seeing a decline are in Seattle</text>
  <text start="356.589" dur="6.63">Phoenix New York Detroit and many other</text>
  <text start="360.399" dur="7.13">cities it&amp;#39;s beginning to happen right</text>
  <text start="363.219" dur="7.2">now and we saw this happen back in</text>
  <text start="367.529" dur="5.5">2006-2007 leading up to 2008 the</text>
  <text start="370.419" dur="4.8">financial crisis and what happens is if</text>
  <text start="373.029" dur="5.01">people see the prices of homes coming</text>
  <text start="375.219" dur="4.8">down they take the houses off the market</text>
  <text start="378.039" dur="2.64">when people see the houses coming off</text>
  <text start="380.019" dur="4.8">the market</text>
  <text start="380.679" dur="7.02">traffic dries up once traffic dries up</text>
  <text start="384.819" dur="5.64">people watch the market and they see</text>
  <text start="387.699" dur="4.56">that it&amp;#39;s not improving they don&amp;#39;t sell</text>
  <text start="390.459" dur="3.93">the homes and everything starts to fall</text>
  <text start="392.259" dur="4.11">apart and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="394.389" dur="3.66">gonna be seeing because we&amp;#39;re headed in</text>
  <text start="396.369" dur="3.81">that direction actually they were</text>
  <text start="398.049" dur="4.8">already reporting on this and we</text>
  <text start="400.179" dur="5.64">reported on this yesterday that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="402.849" dur="7.08">not getting as many offers as they used</text>
  <text start="405.819" dur="6.48">to it&amp;#39;s all starting to dry up now in</text>
  <text start="409.929" dur="4.23">the United States we have a major major</text>
  <text start="412.299" dur="4.11">problem and this is a pension problem</text>
  <text start="414.159" dur="3.69">and we talked about this before we</text>
  <text start="416.409" dur="3.84">talked about private we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="417.849" dur="6.09">government and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="420.249" dur="7.77">that the pension problem is a very big</text>
  <text start="423.939" dur="6.33">deal the pension problem that we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="434.439" dur="7.2">problem is the size of Japan&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="438.809" dur="4.79">think about this for a second here how</text>
  <text start="441.639" dur="5.29">big this is</text>
  <text start="443.599" dur="5.88">so state and local pension plans in the</text>
  <text start="446.929" dur="4.23">u.s. now have less than three-quarters</text>

  <text start="451.159" dur="4.921">promised payouts their lowest level</text>
  <text start="453.589" dur="4.23">since at least 2001 and this is</text>

  <text start="698.12" dur="7.02">layer talking about how the economy is</text>
  <text start="701.36" dur="5.76">not doing as well as everyone thinks and</text>

  <text start="734.279" dur="4.5">just going to get worse and every year</text>
  <text start="736.44" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing and watching it get</text>

  <text start="792.6" dur="4.859">easier for many it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="794.7" dur="5.22">very difficult those people that have no</text>
