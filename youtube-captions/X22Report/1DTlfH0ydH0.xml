  <text start="112.25" dur="5.97">system when this system breaks apart and</text>
  <text start="116.03" dur="3.39">comes down just like in 2008 but of</text>
  <text start="118.22" dur="3.69">course this time it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot</text>
  <text start="119.42" dur="5.91">worse because they really didn&amp;#39;t fix the</text>
  <text start="121.91" dur="6.15">problems all they did was tape over them</text>
  <text start="125.33" dur="6">pretend they didn&amp;#39;t exist and they kept</text>
  <text start="128.06" dur="5.91">us in this illusionary world making us</text>
  <text start="131.33" dur="5.4">think that everything was fine but we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="133.97" dur="5.22">been drilling through all the economic</text>
  <text start="136.73" dur="4.95">data we&amp;#39;ve been looking at each sector</text>
  <text start="139.19" dur="4.65">and we&amp;#39;re noticing that a lot of the</text>
  <text start="141.68" dur="4.71">things that are occurring right now are</text>
  <text start="143.84" dur="4.05">very similar to 2008 and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="146.39" dur="5.04">statistics that we&amp;#39;re looking at are</text>
  <text start="147.89" dur="6.75">much worse prior to 2008 when the entire</text>
  <text start="151.43" dur="5.07">system came down now we know that this</text>
  <text start="154.64" dur="3.15">is not just going to be isolated in the</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="3.45">United States we know there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="157.79" dur="4.65">be many other countries like Canada</text>
  <text start="159.95" dur="4.11">Australia throughout Europe that are</text>
  <text start="162.44" dur="5.37">going to get hit this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="164.06" dur="8.64">global event and we can see in Canada</text>
  <text start="167.81" dur="7.8">well things are progressing into a</text>
  <text start="172.7" dur="4.35">perfect storm type of scenario</text>
  <text start="175.61" dur="4.019">especially in the housing market now</text>
  <text start="177.05" dur="4.29">remember the United States went through</text>
  <text start="179.629" dur="4.021">this before many other countries have</text>
  <text start="181.34" dur="4.2">also and we can see that there is a</text>
  <text start="183.65" dur="4.5">perfect storm that is brewing</text>
  <text start="185.54" dur="6">in several Canadian housing markets and</text>
  <text start="188.15" dur="6.3">there are extreme pricing bubbles there</text>
  <text start="191.54" dur="5.399">is over-indebted consumers a major</text>
  <text start="194.45" dur="5.73">tightening of mortgage rules and the</text>
  <text start="196.939" dur="7.531">prospect of rising rates all of this put</text>
  <text start="200.18" dur="7.44">together is a disaster now on the</text>
  <text start="204.47" dur="5.159">regulatory front Canada&amp;#39;s office of the</text>
  <text start="207.62" dur="5.399">superintendent of financial institutions</text>
  <text start="209.629" dur="6.72">is considering new rules that would</text>
  <text start="213.019" dur="6.931">require lenders to effectively stress</text>
  <text start="216.349" dur="6.241">test borrowers now from a practical</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="5.849">standpoint but a move would immediately</text>
  <text start="222.59" dur="6.229">remove around what say 20 percent of the</text>
  <text start="225.799" dur="7.86">average Canadians home buying power now</text>
  <text start="228.819" dur="8.32">take that add the rising of mortgage</text>
  <text start="233.659" dur="5.761">rates and the housing prices continually</text>
  <text start="237.139" dur="4.74">moving up it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot more</text>
  <text start="239.42" dur="4.11">than just 20% and that throws those</text>
  <text start="241.879" dur="5.371">individuals out of the housing market</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="7.44">and by doing this this is going to</text>
  <text start="247.25" dur="6.629">create a problem in Canada going back to</text>
  <text start="250.97" dur="5.79">2008 here in the United States we saw</text>
  <text start="253.879" dur="5.281">almost the same exact thing where there</text>
  <text start="256.76" dur="6.26">were rising rates they were locking down</text>
  <text start="259.16" dur="6.96">on who was getting a mortgage and as</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="5.38">time went on the entire system started</text>
  <text start="266.12" dur="4.32">to break down the same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="268.4" dur="4.019">happen out in Canada it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="270.44" dur="4.02">happen in Australia it&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="272.419" dur="4.68">throughout Europe and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="4.41">right now that we might be at the point</text>
  <text start="277.099" dur="4.29">which I think we are where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.87" dur="5.37">completely too late to stop what is</text>
  <text start="281.389" dur="5.431">coming there are signs that the global</text>
  <text start="284.24" dur="5.82">economy can&amp;#39;t avoid an economic</text>
  <text start="286.82" dur="6.599">apocalypse now let&amp;#39;s look at some of</text>
  <text start="290.06" dur="6.21">these signs we have a tightening of the</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="5.701">monetary policy so what does this mean</text>
  <text start="296.27" dur="4.35">well it means that the cycle of global</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="3.87">monetary tightening well it has begun</text>
  <text start="300.62" dur="4.38">and we can see that the market</text>

  <text start="317.24" dur="2.04">other signs we are seeing well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="2.97">seeing in</text>
  <text start="319.28" dur="5.76">converted and flattening yield curves in</text>
  <text start="321.71" dur="5.55">May of 2017 the Chinese government bond</text>

  <text start="334.04" dur="4.29">flattened and there are many market</text>
  <text start="336.889" dur="4.321">analysts out there saying that an</text>
  <text start="338.33" dur="4.86">inverted US yield curve well what does</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="4.17">that mean that means we&amp;#39;re heading into</text>

  <text start="458.36" dur="6.33">interesting happening here significant</text>
  <text start="461.39" dur="4.62">growth in the value of crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="464.69" dur="2.97">now a lot of people look at this and say</text>
  <text start="466.01" dur="3.72">I have what&amp;#39;s the big deal about that</text>
  <text start="467.66" dur="4.8">who cares about Bitcoin who cares about</text>
  <text start="469.73" dur="4.86">all of this cryptocurrency it makes no</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="4.68">sense whatsoever and what does it have</text>
  <text start="474.59" dur="4.23">to do with the economy anyhow well think</text>
  <text start="477.14" dur="4.83">about what&amp;#39;s been happening right now in</text>
  <text start="478.82" dur="5.94">the past five months the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="481.97" dur="4.89">industry well they have experienced</text>
  <text start="484.76" dur="7.73">tremendous growth in market</text>
  <text start="486.86" dur="9.21">capitalization why why has it seen such</text>
  <text start="492.49" dur="6.37">growth well remember a lot of these</text>
  <text start="496.07" dur="5.7">investors they&amp;#39;re receiving no interest</text>
  <text start="498.86" dur="6.14">in the banks whatsoever many people are</text>
  <text start="501.77" dur="5.55">very nervous about the fiat currency and</text>
  <text start="505" dur="4.75">investors are seeking to escape the</text>
  <text start="507.32" dur="5.81">formal banking and financial system and</text>
  <text start="509.75" dur="7.89">they&amp;#39;re looking for a place to put their</text>
  <text start="513.13" dur="7.089">currency so they&amp;#39;ve turned to crypto</text>
  <text start="517.64" dur="5.43">currencies now we can see this out in</text>
  <text start="520.219" dur="6.391">Japan where the Japanese businesses and</text>
  <text start="523.07" dur="5.88">citizens have been pouring billions into</text>
  <text start="526.61" dur="4.44">Bitcoin and we need to remember out in</text>
  <text start="528.95" dur="5.22">Japan they have negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="531.05" dur="4.38">and people are not sure of the economy</text>
  <text start="534.17" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re trying to escape all the</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="5.19">regulations they&amp;#39;re trying to escape the</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="4.53">control of the central bank we also see</text>
  <text start="540.62" dur="4.02">this in China we see this in a lot of</text>
  <text start="542.42" dur="5.22">the emerging markets and it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="544.64" dur="6.33">to grow here in the US yes it is quite</text>
  <text start="547.64" dur="6.45">small right now but we can see the big</text>
  <text start="550.97" dur="5.85">players they are getting into the crypto</text>
  <text start="554.09" dur="5.49">currency for a reason and we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="556.82" dur="4.62">lot of the big players starting to do</text>
  <text start="559.58" dur="5.49">this right now and that is a sure sign</text>
  <text start="561.44" dur="7.02">that something is about to change and</text>
  <text start="565.07" dur="5.67">change drastically because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="568.46" dur="6.27">seeing is that people are losing faith</text>
  <text start="570.74" dur="6.72">in the current system and yes we are at</text>
  <text start="574.73" dur="4.47">the beginning stages of this not many</text>
  <text start="577.46" dur="3.45">people know about crypto currencies if</text>
  <text start="579.2" dur="3.24">you ask them they might have heard</text>
  <text start="580.91" dur="4.29">something about it but they have no clue</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="3.81">what it is and normally what happens in</text>
  <text start="585.2" dur="4.59">the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="586.25" dur="6.75">all the insiders they get in first then</text>
  <text start="589.79" dur="5.22">it moves down to the next level the next</text>
  <text start="593" dur="4.2">level and before you know it the</text>
  <text start="595.01" dur="3.69">everyday person is trying to get in but</text>
  <text start="597.2" dur="4.11">all those people who got in in the</text>
  <text start="598.7" dur="5.67">beginning they met out very very well</text>
  <text start="601.31" dur="4.95">and all those individuals who waited</text>
  <text start="604.37" dur="3.33">because they couldn&amp;#39;t believe where they</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="3.51">weren&amp;#39;t sure or they didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="607.7" dur="4.05">anything about it they&amp;#39;re left out in</text>
  <text start="609.77" dur="3.93">the dark it&amp;#39;s the same thing with the</text>
  <text start="611.75" dur="4.8">stock market the housing market the</text>
  <text start="613.7" dur="5.13">insiders realized and they know from</text>
  <text start="616.55" dur="3.81">being insiders that they&amp;#39;ve reached the</text>
  <text start="618.83" dur="4.11">bubble the height of the bubble they</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="4.2">start getting out of the market getting</text>
  <text start="622.94" dur="5.43">out of the housing market and then</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="6.6">they&amp;#39;re celled off to sold off to retail</text>
  <text start="628.37" dur="4.47">investors retail speculators who say hey</text>
  <text start="631.16" dur="3.84">this is the perfect time to get in and</text>
  <text start="632.84" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m going to do and then all</text>
  <text start="635" dur="3.96">of a sudden the entire system comes</text>
  <text start="637.31" dur="4.8">crashing down though all those people</text>
  <text start="638.96" dur="5.01">are left with losing assets they lose</text>
  <text start="642.11" dur="3.15">all their money but the insiders they</text>
  <text start="643.97" dur="5.16">made it out I remember in the beginning</text>
  <text start="645.26" dur="6.15">of the internet craze where there were</text>
  <text start="649.13" dur="4.17">many many individuals that knew what was</text>
  <text start="651.41" dur="4.59">happening and they were buying up as</text>
  <text start="653.3" dur="6.12">many domain names as they possibly could</text>
  <text start="656" dur="6.089">they owned them and it could be for a</text>
  <text start="659.42" dur="4.62">major corporation it could be for you</text>
  <text start="662.089" dur="4.531">know so a small business but they took</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="5.7">those names and then they sold them off</text>
  <text start="666.62" dur="5.43">later on making millions of dollars</text>
  <text start="669.74" dur="4.37">because they understood that everyone</text>
  <text start="672.05" dur="4.47">wanted to have an online presence</text>
  <text start="674.11" dur="5.05">eventually maybe not in the beginning</text>
  <text start="676.52" dur="6.21">when we had AOL or if anyone remembers</text>
  <text start="679.16" dur="6.21">prodigy maybe not at that point but they</text>
  <text start="682.73" dur="4.53">knew it was coming so they started to</text>
  <text start="685.37" dur="4.02">purchase as many of the domain names as</text>
  <text start="687.26" dur="3.15">possible the same thing is happening</text>
  <text start="689.39" dur="3.57">right now</text>
  <text start="690.41" dur="5.19">these insiders these people who know</text>
  <text start="692.96" dur="4.26">they realize what is coming and this is</text>
  <text start="695.6" dur="3.66">why they&amp;#39;re making the move right now</text>
  <text start="697.22" dur="3.72">and we&amp;#39;re seeing it happen not just here</text>
  <text start="699.26" dur="3.75">in United States but all over the world</text>
  <text start="700.94" dur="4.02">actually it&amp;#39;s happening first all over</text>
  <text start="703.01" dur="4.56">the world and a little bit here in the</text>
  <text start="704.96" dur="4.11">United States because we&amp;#39;re kept in the</text>

  <text start="709.07" dur="5.88">still sleeping thinking that the dollar</text>
  <text start="710.87" dur="7.589">is the supreme currency and that is</text>

  <text start="726.56" dur="4.23">saying this and this is coming from Wolf</text>
  <text start="728.03" dur="5.28">Wolf Richter he wrote an article about</text>
  <text start="730.79" dur="6.6">this why the next recession will be a</text>
  <text start="733.31" dur="5.76">doozy for consumers and when you really</text>
  <text start="737.39" dur="4.17">think about it you could understand why</text>
  <text start="739.07" dur="7.46">this is going to be a problem now</text>
  <text start="741.56" dur="10.71">remember when we had other recessions</text>
  <text start="746.53" dur="8.64">they recovered jobs were created and the</text>
  <text start="752.27" dur="6.63">economy got better but something changed</text>
  <text start="755.17" dur="6.04">since 2000 and it could be seen in the</text>
  <text start="758.9" dur="4.8">employment population ratio which tracks</text>
  <text start="761.21" dur="6.69">people over 16 years of age who have</text>
  <text start="763.7" dur="7.23">jobs as defined by the BLS from 1960</text>

  <text start="770.93" dur="5.01">recessions but then during the recovery</text>
  <text start="773.83" dur="4.78">basically regained all the lost ground</text>
  <text start="775.94" dur="5.73">plus some ratcheting up to new records</text>
  <text start="778.61" dur="5.01">after each recession some of this had to</text>
  <text start="781.67" dur="5.01">do with women entering the workforce in</text>
  <text start="783.62" dur="8.19">large numbers now the ratio peak in</text>
  <text start="786.68" dur="7.98">April of 2000 was at 64.7% a new pattern</text>
  <text start="791.81" dur="4.74">was developed as before the ratio drops</text>
  <text start="794.66" dur="3.96">before the official recession begins and</text>
  <text start="796.55" dur="5.25">keeps dropping until after the recession</text>
  <text start="798.62" dur="6.05">has ended but when employment recovers</text>
  <text start="801.8" dur="5.64">the ratio picks up only slowly</text>
  <text start="804.67" dur="4.84">recovering only a fraction of the ground</text>
  <text start="807.44" dur="3.6">loss before the next recession hits this</text>
  <text start="809.51" dur="5.55">has happened over the last two</text>

  <text start="826.37" dur="6.66">during that time non-farm payrolls</text>
  <text start="830.48" dur="5.52">plunged by eight point seven million</text>
  <text start="833.03" dur="6.66">jobs over the seven plus years of the</text>

  <text start="902.989" dur="6.08">sure the next recession will be even</text>
  <text start="905.54" dur="6.599">tougher on people who want to work and</text>
