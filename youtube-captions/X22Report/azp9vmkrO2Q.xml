  <text start="171.97" dur="7.829">nothing to do with it whatsoever the</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="6.699">information that was coming out people</text>
  <text start="179.799" dur="5.461">were able to determine what was real</text>
  <text start="183.069" dur="5.131">what was fake and they went with their</text>
  <text start="185.26" dur="7.05">gut of what they knew and they wanted</text>
  <text start="188.2" dur="8.31">someone different than what we&amp;#39;ve had in</text>
  <text start="192.31" dur="7.14">the past and they went on to say in</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="5.16">summary that the data suggests that</text>
  <text start="199.45" dur="4.319">social media were not the most important</text>

  <text start="228.639" dur="7.141">they&amp;#39;re calling fake is a complete fake</text>
  <text start="232.449" dur="6.47">fight all they want to do is get rid of</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="6.569">all those individuals that are reporting</text>
  <text start="238.919" dur="6.04">out of their controlled information and</text>
  <text start="242.349" dur="4.081">you could see it today the corporate</text>
  <text start="244.959" dur="4.351">media welp</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;re on one path and the alternative</text>
  <text start="249.31" dur="6.799">media is on another path where the</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="7.579">alternative media is not backed by</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="9.34">different entities funded by</text>
  <text start="260.549" dur="7.3">billionaires for a certain agenda many</text>
  <text start="265.449" dur="4.701">of the alternative sites are individuals</text>
  <text start="267.849" dur="7.711">just trying to get the truth out there</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="8.92">now we see out in Berkeley where riots</text>
  <text start="275.56" dur="8.31">have taken place because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="279.07" dur="7.469">want a speech by Breitbart news editor</text>

  <text start="300.27" dur="5.739">they were throwing rocks through</text>
  <text start="302.199" dur="7.911">building win buildings windows they set</text>
  <text start="306.009" dur="6.991">generator on fire near the entrance and</text>
  <text start="310.11" dur="5.44">they were just creating havoc in the</text>
  <text start="313" dur="3.96">area police ordered protesters to</text>
  <text start="315.55" dur="3.66">disperse as a</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="5.67">at the school and they put the campus</text>

  <text start="328.569" dur="5.761">looking at right now is a protest and</text>
  <text start="332.38" dur="5.219">it&amp;#39;s not even a protest as it&amp;#39;s rioting</text>
  <text start="334.33" dur="5.429">because they didn&amp;#39;t want someone to</text>
  <text start="337.599" dur="5.371">speak at the student union let&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="339.759" dur="5.961">this in context right here someone was</text>
  <text start="342.97" dur="8.22">going to speak and they didn&amp;#39;t like it</text>
  <text start="345.72" dur="8.61">so they destroyed property they decided</text>
  <text start="351.19" dur="7.259">okay we&amp;#39;re going to destroy the property</text>
  <text start="354.33" dur="5.47">here on the college campus I mean think</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="3.5">about what they just did here because</text>
  <text start="359.8" dur="4.739">they didn&amp;#39;t want someone to speak</text>
  <text start="361.949" dur="4.871">imagine if there was a real problem what</text>
  <text start="364.539" dur="3.781">these individuals would do let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="366.82" dur="4.77">that the economic collapse started</text>
  <text start="368.32" dur="4.77">tomorrow they didn&amp;#39;t have credit they</text>
  <text start="371.59" dur="3.78">couldn&amp;#39;t get their funds they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="4.65">find food what do you think the rioting</text>
  <text start="375.37" dur="5.43">the rioting is going to be like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="4.649">going to be completely awful I mean</text>
  <text start="380.8" dur="4.679">wouldn&amp;#39;t a better solution if they</text>
  <text start="382.389" dur="7.77">really wanted a protest have no one show</text>
  <text start="385.479" dur="6.571">up to the guys speech and let him stand</text>
  <text start="390.159" dur="4.051">there with no one there wouldn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="4.649">send a better message I mean this is</text>
  <text start="394.21" dur="4.889">sending a message that they&amp;#39;re a bunch</text>
  <text start="396.699" dur="5.491">of babies and they&amp;#39;re just out there</text>
  <text start="399.099" dur="7.081">destroying things because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="7.02">like someone speaking now Trump is out</text>
  <text start="406.18" dur="9.12">there saying this is ridiculous a person</text>
  <text start="409.21" dur="9.6">was hired a he was going to speak and he</text>
  <text start="415.3" dur="5.25">has every right to speak freely and if</text>
  <text start="418.81" dur="4.199">Berkeley doesn&amp;#39;t get everything under</text>
  <text start="420.55" dur="6.54">control we&amp;#39;re gonna hold back federal</text>
  <text start="423.009" dur="8.431">funding this is I mean think about what</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="8.81">is happening here now we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="431.44" dur="7.59">has created this executive order to</text>
  <text start="435.9" dur="5.319">temporarily stop individuals coming in</text>
  <text start="439.03" dur="5.18">from different countries in the Middle</text>
  <text start="441.219" dur="6.301">East and during this period of time an</text>
  <text start="444.21" dur="6.7">iraqi-american man who made headlines</text>
  <text start="447.52" dur="6.3">early in the week who claimed that his</text>
  <text start="450.91" dur="4.11">sick mother died because of Donald</text>
  <text start="453.82" dur="4.62">Trump&amp;#39;s executive order on immigration</text>
  <text start="455.02" dur="5.61">and the original story was that Mike</text>
  <text start="458.44" dur="3.93">Haggar a US citizen born in Iraq was</text>
  <text start="460.63" dur="3.81">visiting relatives in Iraq but was</text>
  <text start="462.37" dur="4.62">forced to abandon his mother in that</text>
  <text start="464.44" dur="4.05">country when he tried to return home he</text>
  <text start="466.99" dur="3.9">said he was returning home with his</text>
  <text start="468.49" dur="3.6">family that included his sick mom they</text>
  <text start="470.89" dur="4.53">were returning home to the United States</text>
  <text start="472.09" dur="5.16">where his mother has lived since 1995 as</text>
  <text start="475.42" dur="4.29">they were waiting in line at the airport</text>
  <text start="477.25" dur="4.8">in Iraq he was told that he could pass</text>
  <text start="479.71" dur="3.78">through because he was a US citizen but</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="4.29">his family members including his mom</text>
  <text start="483.49" dur="5.73">weren&amp;#39;t allowed despite holding green</text>
  <text start="486.34" dur="5.52">cards he said I was just shocked I had</text>
  <text start="489.22" dur="5.34">to put my mom back on the wheel on on</text>
  <text start="491.86" dur="5.49">the wheelchair and take her back call</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="5.85">the ambulance she was very upset she</text>
  <text start="497.35" dur="3.69">knew right there if we send her back to</text>
  <text start="500.41" dur="2.34">the hospital</text>
  <text start="501.04" dur="5.97">she&amp;#39;s going to pass away she&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="502.75" dur="7.46">make it and she did pass away the</text>
  <text start="507.01" dur="9.589">problem is she passed away five days</text>
  <text start="510.21" dur="10.209">before the executive order and Fox 2</text>
  <text start="516.599" dur="7.721">went in and investigated and found out</text>
  <text start="520.419" dur="7.881">that she died five days before the</text>
  <text start="524.32" dur="7.65">entire story was a lie</text>
  <text start="528.3" dur="6.73">the I&amp;#39;m M leader of the Karbala Islamic</text>
  <text start="531.97" dur="5.73">educational center in Dearborn says Mike</text>
  <text start="535.03" dur="4.29">Hagar&amp;#39;s mom did not pass away this</text>
  <text start="537.7" dur="4.38">weekend after being barred from</text>
  <text start="539.32" dur="4.89">travelling to United States he confirmed</text>
  <text start="542.08" dur="8.84">that Hagar&amp;#39;s mother died before the ban</text>
  <text start="544.21" dur="12.87">was put into place so they use this and</text>
  <text start="550.92" dur="8.14">it was a complete lie again fake news</text>
  <text start="557.08" dur="5.49">and I just want to do a flashback right</text>
  <text start="559.06" dur="5.25">now if we go back in time to Obama where</text>
  <text start="562.57" dur="6.3">he gave a speech about immigration and</text>
  <text start="564.31" dur="6.9">he talked about securing the borders and</text>
  <text start="568.87" dur="5.58">here&amp;#39;s what he said I&amp;#39;ll agree on the</text>
  <text start="571.21" dur="5.28">need to better secure the border and a</text>
  <text start="574.45" dur="4.86">punishing ploy errs who choose to hire</text>
  <text start="576.49" dur="4.65">illegal immigrants you know we are a</text>
  <text start="579.31" dur="3.6">generous and welcoming people here in</text>
  <text start="581.14" dur="3.48">the United States but those who enter</text>
  <text start="582.91" dur="3.75">the country illegally and</text>
  <text start="584.62" dur="5.79">those who employ them disrespect the</text>
  <text start="586.66" dur="6.33">rule of law and they are showing</text>
  <text start="590.41" dur="5.55">disregard for those who are following</text>
  <text start="592.99" dur="4.59">the law securing simply cannot allow and</text>
  <text start="595.96" dur="5.61">here&amp;#39;s what he saw into the United</text>
  <text start="597.58" dur="7.02">States undetected undocumented unchecked</text>
  <text start="601.57" dur="5.25">and circumventing the line of people who</text>
  <text start="604.6" dur="5.19">are waiting patiently diligently and</text>
  <text start="606.82" dur="5.55">lawfully to become immigrants in this</text>
  <text start="609.79" dur="5.94">country now we can see the corporate</text>
  <text start="612.37" dur="7.34">media they are just continually pushing</text>
  <text start="615.73" dur="7.29">out fake news and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="619.71" dur="4.84">twisting everything and the right now</text>
  <text start="623.02" dur="4.11">the White House is slamming The</text>
  <text start="624.55" dur="5.64">Associated Press for fabricating a</text>
  <text start="627.13" dur="5.04">national story that claim that President</text>
  <text start="630.19" dur="5.79">Trump threatened Mexican president</text>
  <text start="632.17" dur="8.43">Enrique Pena Nieto with a US military</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="7.23">invasion into Mexico if Mexico didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="640.6" dur="6.18">curb the bad hombres near the US border</text>
  <text start="643.21" dur="8.07">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="646.78" dur="8.25">is that the Mexican Mexican president he</text>
  <text start="651.28" dur="6.47">also said yeah this never happened this</text>
  <text start="655.03" dur="5.58">conversation that they&amp;#39;re reporting on</text>
  <text start="657.75" dur="5.83">didn&amp;#39;t happen the president used didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="660.61" dur="7.08">use the terms bad hombres to the leader</text>
  <text start="663.58" dur="5.91">of Mexico none of that happened he said</text>
  <text start="667.69" dur="5.25">this is just a sad joke on the part of</text>
  <text start="669.49" dur="6.12">the news media and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="672.94" dur="6.96">interesting is that ap says their source</text>

  <text start="688.03" dur="8.64">does that mean what transcript do you</text>
  <text start="691.81" dur="6.78">have because there is no transcript so</text>
  <text start="696.67" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re all scratching their heads going</text>
  <text start="698.59" dur="4.47">I don&amp;#39;t even know where this information</text>
  <text start="700.06" dur="5.64">came from now are they making it up can</text>
  <text start="703.06" dur="5.55">they produce it I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;d be very</text>
  <text start="705.7" dur="5.64">interested to see the transcript now out</text>

  <text start="722.77" dur="4.65">and we can see that they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="724.36" dur="6.51">military assets into position getting</text>
  <text start="727.42" dur="6.3">prepared for what is coming now we see</text>

  <text start="748.96" dur="5.54">authorities eased sanctions against</text>
  <text start="750.7" dur="6.99">Russia&amp;#39;s Federal Security Service now</text>
  <text start="754.5" dur="6.28">the news picked this up and they said</text>
  <text start="757.69" dur="5.1">that yes the White House is easing</text>
  <text start="760.78" dur="4.59">sanctions against Russia now the White</text>
  <text start="762.79" dur="4.68">House came out and they said well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765.37" dur="4.92">not exactly true we&amp;#39;re not easing</text>
  <text start="767.47" dur="7.14">sanctions and this is coming from Sean</text>
  <text start="770.29" dur="6.3">Spicer saying that the Treasury after</text>
  <text start="774.61" dur="4.32">the sanctions are put into place they go</text>
  <text start="776.59" dur="3.99">back and look at specific carve outs for</text>
  <text start="778.93" dur="3.9">different industries or products and</text>
  <text start="780.58" dur="4.89">services it is a regular course of</text>
  <text start="782.83" dur="5.73">action that the Treasury does often when</text>
  <text start="785.47" dur="5.04">sanctions are imposed Trump himself also</text>
  <text start="788.56" dur="4.92">said I haven&amp;#39;t eased anything yet on</text>
  <text start="790.51" dur="6.24">Russia he&amp;#39;s looking into it</text>
  <text start="793.48" dur="7.37">he would like to do it but it has not</text>
  <text start="796.75" dur="6.9">been done right now and we can see that</text>
  <text start="800.85" dur="5.02">the move was widely interpreted as</text>
  <text start="803.65" dur="4.8">president Trump relaxing sanctions on</text>
  <text start="805.87" dur="3.75">Russia but foreign policy experts cited</text>
  <text start="808.45" dur="3.66">by the hill insisted that</text>
  <text start="809.62" dur="3.78">yeah the OFAC&amp;#39;s amendment was likely</text>
  <text start="812.11" dur="4.31">meant to clean up unintended</text>
  <text start="813.4" dur="5.97">consequences on American tech companies</text>
  <text start="816.42" dur="5.98">so we can see right now they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="819.37" dur="4.74">out information and they&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="822.4" dur="4.14">out there saying whatever they want to</text>
  <text start="824.11" dur="3.99">say without really doing fact-checking</text>
  <text start="826.54" dur="3.57">and this is what the corporate media has</text>
  <text start="828.1" dur="4.53">been doing and I understand everyone</text>
  <text start="830.11" dur="5.88">makes mistakes but we could see that</text>
  <text start="832.63" dur="7.05">they twist the stories they twist the</text>
  <text start="835.99" dur="4.65">information they add words in where they</text>
  <text start="839.68" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t belong</text>
  <text start="840.64" dur="6.27">like the Muslim ban there&amp;#39;s no Muslim</text>
  <text start="842.83" dur="6.6">ban because there&amp;#39;s no race religion or</text>
  <text start="846.91" dur="4.77">anything else associated in the</text>
  <text start="849.43" dur="3.81">executive order</text>
  <text start="851.68" dur="4.08">they like to play this up and then they</text>
  <text start="853.24" dur="6.51">and they they they push the agenda this</text>
  <text start="855.76" dur="6.21">way we see out in Ukraine poroshenko is</text>
  <text start="859.75" dur="4.89">realizing under Trump that he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="861.97" dur="4.91">going to be getting any money from the</text>
  <text start="864.64" dur="5.31">United States at this point or support</text>
  <text start="866.88" dur="4.57">from the United States at this point and</text>
  <text start="869.95" dur="3.81">that is front coming from the executive</text>
  <text start="871.45" dur="5.25">branch where the executive branch most</text>
  <text start="873.76" dur="5.31">likely will not give him support and he</text>
  <text start="876.7" dur="4.05">understands this and he understands that</text>
  <text start="879.07" dur="3.87">he can&amp;#39;t rely on Washington right now</text>
  <text start="880.75" dur="5.43">and this is why he has pushed forward</text>
  <text start="882.94" dur="5.3">with this war but something very</text>
  <text start="886.18" dur="5.73">interesting</text>
  <text start="888.24" dur="6.25">Putin first of all said that yes Kiev is</text>
  <text start="891.91" dur="5.25">provoking the flare up in fighting in in</text>
  <text start="894.49" dur="4.26">eastern Ukraine saying it was a ploy to</text>
  <text start="897.16" dur="5.81">win the support of the administration of</text>
  <text start="898.75" dur="8.1">Donald Trump because they need money now</text>
  <text start="902.97" dur="9.97">before all this happened we see that</text>
  <text start="906.85" dur="9.33">McCain and Graham they visited Ukraine</text>
  <text start="912.94" dur="5.64">the front lines they spoke to poroshenko</text>
  <text start="916.18" dur="6">we also know that Biden also visited</text>
  <text start="918.58" dur="8.009">this area and after they visited all of</text>
  <text start="922.18" dur="9.15">a sudden war in this area started to</text>
  <text start="926.589" dur="7.081">flare up and we can see that the OSCE is</text>
  <text start="931.33" dur="4.71">watching battle to Ukrainian battle</text>
  <text start="933.67" dur="5.46">tanks because they have been moved up to</text>
  <text start="936.04" dur="8.54">the front line and at this point we</text>
  <text start="939.13" dur="8.67">understand that Ukraine well they want</text>
  <text start="944.58" dur="6.34">the entire country back those</text>
  <text start="947.8" dur="6.06">individuals that were involved in the</text>
  <text start="950.92" dur="6.44">coup d&amp;#39;etat they want Crimea they want</text>
  <text start="953.86" dur="7.469">the southeast they want all of it and we</text>
  <text start="957.36" dur="7.419">see McCain right now is calling on Trump</text>
  <text start="961.329" dur="7.711">to help Ukraine and send over lethal</text>
  <text start="964.779" dur="7.411">weapons so the whole thing was to box</text>
  <text start="969.04" dur="7.5">Trump in to try to help Ukraine they</text>
  <text start="972.19" dur="7.11">planned this from the beginning and we</text>
  <text start="976.54" dur="4.669">can see that poroshenko realizes most</text>
  <text start="979.3" dur="4.65">likely his days are numbered there and</text>
  <text start="981.209" dur="4.361">he&amp;#39;s going to go and push a war now the</text>
  <text start="983.95" dur="4.47">corporate media is spinning this around</text>
  <text start="985.57" dur="4.92">saying that Russia is invading please</text>
  <text start="988.42" dur="2.669">we&amp;#39;ve been this we&amp;#39;ve been through this</text>
  <text start="990.49" dur="2.909">before</text>
  <text start="991.089" dur="5.37">if Russia really wanted to invade and</text>
  <text start="993.399" dur="6.151">take over Ukraine they would just do it</text>
  <text start="996.459" dur="5.281">they would send their air power in they</text>
  <text start="999.55" dur="4.95">would send full troops in first they</text>
  <text start="1001.74" dur="4.469">would bomb the entire area wipe out Kiev</text>
  <text start="1004.5" dur="4.259">they wouldn&amp;#39;t even know what to do and</text>
  <text start="1006.209" dur="5.55">they would just move in and take Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1008.759" dur="5.19">they had this chance a couple years ago</text>
  <text start="1011.759" dur="5.161">the southeastern people were pushing the</text>
  <text start="1013.949" dur="4.44">Kiev forces back Kiev had major losses I</text>
  <text start="1016.92" dur="2.94">mean Russia could have just stepped in</text>
  <text start="1018.389" dur="4.351">and said okay let&amp;#39;s finish the job here</text>
  <text start="1019.86" dur="4.26">but they didn&amp;#39;t the southeastern people</text>
  <text start="1022.74" dur="3.74">they moved back they just want their</text>
  <text start="1024.12" dur="5.9">location they just want their area</text>
  <text start="1026.48" dur="6.49">Crimea just wants to be left alone and</text>
  <text start="1030.02" dur="5.35">what Putin stepped in and said listen</text>
  <text start="1032.97" dur="4.8">let&amp;#39;s have peace here&amp;#39;s the Mint&amp;#39;s -</text>
  <text start="1035.37" dur="5.01">agreement let&amp;#39;s talk about what is going</text>
  <text start="1037.77" dur="4.86">on here let&amp;#39;s stop the war and this is</text>
  <text start="1040.38" dur="4.709">when the United States Poland and other</text>
  <text start="1042.63" dur="5.25">countries came in and started to train</text>
  <text start="1045.089" dur="6.181">the forces once again bring in military</text>
  <text start="1047.88" dur="6.029">weapons and here we are once again doing</text>
  <text start="1051.27" dur="6.779">the same exact thing pushing the agenda</text>
  <text start="1053.909" dur="6.421">for war now we can see that the elite</text>
  <text start="1058.049" dur="6.181">the central bankers they understand they</text>
  <text start="1060.33" dur="7.469">can get Trump all hot and bothered about</text>
  <text start="1064.23" dur="6.48">Iran and China and we see right now the</text>
  <text start="1067.799" dur="6.901">United States might be looking to place</text>
  <text start="1070.71" dur="5.78">sanctions on Iran right now we have a</text>
  <text start="1074.7" dur="4.05">House Representative speaker Paul Ryan</text>
  <text start="1076.49" dur="5.439">who is saying that yeah we should be</text>
  <text start="1078.75" dur="6.51">placing sanctions on Iran don&amp;#39;t worry it</text>
  <text start="1081.929" dur="5.011">won&amp;#39;t affect the nuclear deal that we</text>
  <text start="1085.26" dur="4.289">have with Iran it doesn&amp;#39;t violate it</text>
  <text start="1086.94" dur="5.46">whatsoever but of course all the</text>
  <text start="1089.549" dur="6.571">stations do and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1092.4" dur="7.259">that the Iranian government is saying</text>
  <text start="1096.12" dur="5.52">that you know this threatening us is not</text>
  <text start="1099.659" dur="4.02">going to do anything we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="1101.64" dur="4.71">dumping the dollar you won&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1103.679" dur="4.38">control over Iran any more by</text>
  <text start="1106.35" dur="3.36">sanctioning anything because we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1108.059" dur="2.85">going to be using the dollar and you can</text>
  <text start="1109.71" dur="5.19">see why they&amp;#39;re moving in this direction</text>
  <text start="1110.909" dur="8.25">and the elite right now they want a war</text>
  <text start="1114.9" dur="4.649">started now Trump is out there and he</text>
  <text start="1119.159" dur="3.541">put</text>
  <text start="1119.549" dur="4.771">I ran on notice about firing missiles</text>
  <text start="1122.7" dur="4.26">and of course Iran is saying listen we</text>
  <text start="1124.32" dur="4.26">can create missiles we can fire them you</text>
  <text start="1126.96" dur="3.39">cannot stop us from defending our</text>
  <text start="1128.58" dur="3.36">country which again</text>
  <text start="1130.35" dur="3.74">the United States and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="1131.94" dur="6.15">world cannot and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="1134.09" dur="6.789">Iran has not started a war in two</text>
  <text start="1138.09" dur="5.1">hundred years yes they defended</text>
  <text start="1140.879" dur="4.29">themselves but they haven&amp;#39;t started one</text>
  <text start="1143.19" dur="4.439">where on the other hand the United</text>
  <text start="1145.169" dur="4.26">States has actually the United States</text>
  <text start="1147.629" dur="7.441">has gone into many countries and had</text>
  <text start="1149.429" dur="8.33">regime change under false pretenses now</text>
  <text start="1155.07" dur="5.699">we see that Trump has had his first</text>
  <text start="1157.759" dur="4.721">counterterrorism operation which ended</text>
  <text start="1160.769" dur="5.22">in the death of a u.s. Navy SEAL William</text>
  <text start="1162.48" dur="5.97">Ryan Owens and what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="1165.989" dur="4.591">that the whole operation was undertaken</text>
  <text start="1168.45" dur="5.75">without sufficient intelligence ground</text>
  <text start="1170.58" dur="6.51">support or adequate backup preparations</text>
  <text start="1174.2" dur="4.659">the medic on the scene said about 30</text>
  <text start="1177.09" dur="5.399">people including 10 women and children</text>
  <text start="1178.859" dur="4.851">they were killed and the US Central</text>
  <text start="1182.489" dur="3.92">Command said in a statement that</text>
  <text start="1183.71" dur="4.719">investigating team had concluded</text>
  <text start="1186.409" dur="5.051">regrettably that civilian non-combatants</text>
  <text start="1188.429" dur="6.87">were likely killed which we are</text>
  <text start="1191.46" dur="5.909">confirming with the medics now the US</text>
  <text start="1195.299" dur="5.641">official said the extremists base had</text>
  <text start="1197.369" dur="5.731">been identified as a target before the</text>
  <text start="1200.94" dur="3.239">Obama administration left office on</text>
  <text start="1203.1" dur="3.029">January 20th</text>
  <text start="1204.179" dur="4.051">but Obama said you know something passed</text>
  <text start="1206.129" dur="4.77">this intelligence on to Trump and let</text>
  <text start="1208.23" dur="4.379">him handle this so to me when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1210.899" dur="3.63">looking at this stuff we have to</text>
  <text start="1212.609" dur="3.81">understand they&amp;#39;re still powers that are</text>
  <text start="1214.529" dur="4.02">working within the government and this</text>
  <text start="1216.419" dur="5.7">kind of looks like it was a complete set</text>
  <text start="1218.549" dur="5.521">up for the Trump administration they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1222.119" dur="5.88">trying to push him in certain directions</text>
  <text start="1224.07" dur="7.65">and the question is is the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="1227.999" dur="7.8">actually sabotaging Trump are they</text>
  <text start="1231.72" dur="7.189">trying to get him to start or try to</text>
  <text start="1235.799" dur="5.49">provoke these countries into a war</text>
  <text start="1238.909" dur="5.171">because we understand the central bank</text>
  <text start="1241.289" dur="4.38">the elites this is exactly what they</text>
  <text start="1244.08" dur="3.839">want they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this for</text>
  <text start="1245.669" dur="4.44">quite a while and now we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1247.919" dur="5.311">pushing their agenda and now we can see</text>
  <text start="1250.109" dur="7.621">why the Doomsday Clock was pushed</text>
  <text start="1253.23" dur="6.81">to midnight because their plan is to</text>
  <text start="1257.73" dur="5.85">start this war now they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="1260.04" dur="4.74">wait any longer and the elite decided</text>
  <text start="1263.58" dur="3.54">you know something since Trump is in</text>
  <text start="1264.78" dur="4.74">office war is coming war was always</text>
  <text start="1267.12" dur="4.62">coming we know this because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="1277.26" dur="5.659">these countries what they were doing and</text>
  <text start="1279.69" dur="4.35">we know that the economic system is</text>
  <text start="1282.919" dur="2.5">deteriorating</text>
  <text start="1284.04" dur="4.47">we know the economic system is</text>
  <text start="1285.419" dur="6.061">collapsing and they&amp;#39;d like a war to</text>
  <text start="1288.51" dur="6.06">cover all of this up so when they move</text>
  <text start="1291.48" dur="5.97">that clock closer to midnight that was a</text>
  <text start="1294.57" dur="5.94">signal that they&amp;#39;re ready to go to war</text>
  <text start="1297.45" dur="5.609">and they&amp;#39;re going to push hard now now I</text>
  <text start="1300.51" dur="4.23">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1303.059" dur="5.461">we see something happened in the South</text>
  <text start="1304.74" dur="5.76">China Sea to really ramp this up because</text>

  <text start="1318.72" dur="6.079">gonna fall for it he spoke to Putin and</text>
  <text start="1321.09" dur="6.209">if you notice since Obama left office</text>
  <text start="1324.799" dur="4.26">the corporate media doesn&amp;#39;t say anything</text>
  <text start="1327.299" dur="3.661">about Russian aggression anymore</text>
