  <text start="97.469" dur="8.311">over this period now Europe has been</text>
  <text start="103.04" dur="4.45">using a lot of propaganda to let</text>
  <text start="105.78" dur="5.009">everyone know that the recession is</text>
  <text start="107.49" dur="5.489">behind them it&amp;#39;s all over and they want</text>
  <text start="110.789" dur="5.79">us to believe that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="112.979" dur="6.301">just like Greece did when they receive</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="4.68">the first bailout the eurozone was out</text>
  <text start="119.28" dur="4.229">there saying we solved the problem we</text>
  <text start="121.259" dur="4.021">gave them a bail out Greece is good to</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="4.53">go and everyone else was saying no way</text>
  <text start="125.28" dur="5.24">this cannot be sustained and here we are</text>
  <text start="128.039" dur="5.041">today more people are unemployed</text>
  <text start="130.52" dur="4.87">unemployment is in double digits they</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="5.189">have more debt they can&amp;#39;t pay it off</text>
  <text start="135.39" dur="5.65">they&amp;#39;re letting people go they have</text>
  <text start="138.269" dur="6.94">austerity things are not looking good</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="6.66">out there and it looks like people who</text>
  <text start="145.209" dur="4.471">left money in the banks in Greece the</text>
  <text start="147.7" dur="5.129">government is coming after them and just</text>
  <text start="149.68" dur="6.059">freezing their accounts and taking their</text>
  <text start="152.829" dur="7.171">money for taxes why would you keep your</text>
  <text start="155.739" dur="5.851">money in at this time I wouldn&amp;#39;t if I</text>
  <text start="160" dur="4.079">was out in Greece I would probably take</text>
  <text start="161.59" dur="5.16">it all out and keep it with me or</text>
  <text start="164.079" dur="4.351">someplace safe so this way nobody else</text>
  <text start="166.75" dur="4.43">can get their hands on it and just show</text>
  <text start="168.43" dur="8.369">that my bank account is completely empty</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="8.679">but in Europe so far in quarter three</text>
  <text start="176.799" dur="6.181">we&amp;#39;re seeing 13 of the 17 reporting</text>
  <text start="179.859" dur="7.621">companies missing their revenues and we</text>
  <text start="182.98" dur="7.289">are also seeing this in the u.s. we are</text>
  <text start="187.48" dur="9.27">seeing many many companies missing their</text>
  <text start="190.269" dur="9.78">revenue estimates okay now existing home</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="6.03">sales plunge at fastest pace in 15</text>
  <text start="200.049" dur="5.821">months and we&amp;#39;ve been over the housing</text>
  <text start="202.78" dur="5.76">and we understand that housing is in a</text>
  <text start="205.87" dur="5.1">decline even though Obama was out there</text>
  <text start="208.54" dur="5.099">during the summer the Fed was out there</text>
  <text start="210.97" dur="5.159">during the summer telling everyone that</text>
  <text start="213.639" dur="5.551">housing was you know getting back to</text>
  <text start="216.129" dur="5.881">normal it&amp;#39;s everything&amp;#39;s going well well</text>
  <text start="219.19" dur="5.639">it really wasn&amp;#39;t it was hedge funds it</text>
  <text start="222.01" dur="6.33">was investment companies paying cash for</text>
  <text start="224.829" dur="5.451">homes and their the interest rates were</text>
  <text start="228.34" dur="4.859">very low so there were a couple of</text>
  <text start="230.28" dur="5.5">people out there purchasing homes and</text>
  <text start="233.199" dur="4.111">once the interest rates moved up guess</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="3.989">what they couldn&amp;#39;t afford the homes</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="4.169">anymore and all those investment</text>
  <text start="239.769" dur="4.071">companies saw what was happening and</text>
  <text start="241.479" dur="5.04">they saw that if they didn&amp;#39;t get out now</text>
  <text start="243.84" dur="5.59">they would have been left with all these</text>
  <text start="246.519" dur="5.071">homes so they&amp;#39;re starting to sell these</text>
  <text start="249.43" dur="5.94">houses and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="251.59" dur="6.06">is a huge huge decline in homes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="5.1">seeing a decline in mortgages and</text>
  <text start="257.65" dur="5.16">everything is starting to plunge and of</text>
  <text start="260.47" dur="4.11">course we knew the economy was going to</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="5.34">start to get worse during this period of</text>
  <text start="264.58" dur="6.839">time and so did the government they were</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="6.18">expecting to go to war with Syria and</text>
  <text start="271.419" dur="6.27">then blame some type of cyber attack or</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="6.57">some type of event on another country</text>
  <text start="277.689" dur="6.54">and blame the entire economy collapsing</text>
  <text start="280.9" dur="6.419">on them that didn&amp;#39;t happen so here we</text>
  <text start="284.229" dur="5.761">are we&amp;#39;re at the next phase now the Fed</text>
  <text start="287.319" dur="5.22">is out there saying that they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.99" dur="4.56">taper because of the shutdown which we</text>
  <text start="292.539" dur="4.59">know is completely false we know the</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="5.94">whole entire economy from retail sales</text>
  <text start="297.129" dur="5.13">to housing to the fake stock market to</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="4.979">the manipulated numbers that this</text>
  <text start="302.259" dur="5.671">economy is continually collapsing so</text>
  <text start="305.469" dur="4.081">their way out right now is blaming it on</text>
  <text start="307.93" dur="3.81">the government and they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="3.75">blaming it on the Republicans and this</text>
  <text start="311.74" dur="3.359">is all because of the shutdown all the</text>
  <text start="313.3" dur="3.48">numbers are messed up and we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="315.099" dur="4.801">what kind of effect there you know this</text>
  <text start="316.78" dur="4.289">is going to have going forward and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="2.819">going to tell you what type of effect</text>
  <text start="321.069" dur="3.63">this is going to have its going to have</text>
  <text start="322.719" dur="4.38">an effect of the economy continually</text>
  <text start="324.699" dur="5.131">sliding down and they&amp;#39;re going to need a</text>
  <text start="327.099" dur="6.69">way out so what is the government going</text>
  <text start="329.83" dur="6.42">to do next that is the big question and</text>
  <text start="333.789" dur="5.071">this is what they&amp;#39;re preparing for they</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="7.25">are preparing for that event which will</text>
  <text start="338.86" dur="8.16">shift the blame of this economy</text>
  <text start="343.5" dur="7.33">collapsing to another country and this</text>
  <text start="347.02" dur="6.54">is what they&amp;#39;re building up to now fed</text>
  <text start="350.83" dur="5.04">Evans was out there he was even saying</text>
  <text start="353.56" dur="6.3">that it will take a few months to gauge</text>
  <text start="355.87" dur="6.03">the shutdown impact and he says October</text>
  <text start="359.86" dur="3.66">the tapering is off the table which it</text>
  <text start="361.9" dur="4.139">is it&amp;#39;s completely off because you know</text>
  <text start="363.52" dur="3.989">the fed controls the entire market they</text>
  <text start="366.039" dur="3.63">control the unemployment they control</text>
  <text start="367.509" dur="4.171">the GDP they control the stock market so</text>
  <text start="369.669" dur="4.65">you know with all this control you know</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re not ready to taper yet which</text>
  <text start="374.319" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re never ever going to do what they</text>
  <text start="376.81" dur="5.31">really want to do is increase creating</text>
  <text start="379.779" dur="5.431">the money but how do they do this</text>
  <text start="382.12" dur="5.969">without an event so guess what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="4.949">to happen an event will occur and right</text>
  <text start="388.089" dur="4.29">now they&amp;#39;re looking towards December and</text>
  <text start="390.159" dur="4.591">they&amp;#39;re going to look at all the labor</text>
  <text start="392.379" dur="4.561">reports they&amp;#39;re going to look at the GDP</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="3.9">growth which I believe it comes out in</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="3.18">November I think they&amp;#39;re shooting for</text>
  <text start="398.65" dur="3.21">and they&amp;#39;re going to look at all these</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="4.409">numbers and they&amp;#39;re going to say you</text>
  <text start="401.86" dur="4.08">know you know it looks like we might we</text>
  <text start="404.529" dur="3.151">might not we&amp;#39;re never going to give you</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="3.479">a straight answer no</text>
  <text start="407.68" dur="6.03">what they&amp;#39;re doing is building it back</text>
  <text start="409.419" dur="6.991">up again and waiting for this event to</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="5.25">occur so they can blame it on another</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="4.56">country and this is what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="418.96" dur="4.17">to do they haven&amp;#39;t changed their</text>
  <text start="420.97" dur="5.09">strategy at all it&amp;#39;s just been pushed</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="5.52">back a little bit but that is it and</text>
  <text start="426.06" dur="5.41">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="6.329">seeing a lot of people leave office</text>
  <text start="431.47" dur="5.759">Janet Napolitano we&amp;#39;re seeing the NSA</text>
  <text start="434.979" dur="4.801">chief leaving and we&amp;#39;re seeing new</text>
  <text start="437.229" dur="5.461">people come in even in Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="439.78" dur="7.02">we&amp;#39;re seeing people leaving their key</text>
  <text start="442.69" dur="6.449">positions Michael Evans will retire from</text>
  <text start="446.8" dur="5.79">his position at the end of the year and</text>
  <text start="449.139" dur="6.03">who knows we&amp;#39;ll see how long blois blank</text>
  <text start="452.59" dur="4.919">line remains in his position because</text>
  <text start="455.169" dur="5.731">usually when the collapse comes these</text>
  <text start="457.509" dur="8.461">types of people seem to run and leave</text>
  <text start="460.9" dur="8.22">their position oh and we also saw Jamie</text>
  <text start="465.97" dur="7.83">Dimon he is also stepping down and this</text>
  <text start="469.12" dur="6.9">all happens right before some type of an</text>
  <text start="473.8" dur="4.98">event which eventually leads into a</text>
  <text start="476.02" dur="5.61">collapse and again like I said in my</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="5.1">other reports this still will be the</text>
  <text start="481.63" dur="6.77">first part of the collapse because what</text>
  <text start="483.88" dur="7.8">they want to do is they want to increase</text>
  <text start="488.4" dur="6.46">QE they want to create more money</text>
  <text start="491.68" dur="5.07">because they understand that the nation</text>
  <text start="494.86" dur="4.89">the foreign nations who are holding the</text>
  <text start="496.75" dur="5.849">Treasury bonds will eventually start to</text>
  <text start="499.75" dur="5.88">sell and get rid of these Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="502.599" dur="4.771">and at this time right now the Fed</text>
  <text start="505.63" dur="3.18">doesn&amp;#39;t have the ability they can do it</text>
  <text start="507.37" dur="6.209">in secret but they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="508.81" dur="6.269">ability to you know eat up all the toxic</text>
  <text start="513.579" dur="3.991">real estate which will be coming very</text>
  <text start="515.079" dur="5.041">soon because housing is declining think</text>
  <text start="517.57" dur="4.649">about that then all the foreign nations</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="3.99">starting to sell their Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="522.219" dur="4.441">think about that now you have an</text>
  <text start="524.11" dur="4.44">increase of all of this what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="526.66" dur="3.419">happen if there&amp;#39;s a buyer if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="528.55" dur="3.99">seller of Treasury bonds there goes</text>
  <text start="530.079" dur="5.01">there has to be a buyer all these banks</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="4.86">can hold all these foreclosures so</text>
  <text start="535.089" dur="5.19">somebody has to give them money to keep</text>
  <text start="537.4" dur="3.76">them afloat so the Fed is going to do</text>
  <text start="540.279" dur="2.441">this and</text>
  <text start="541.16" dur="4.409">are going to pump up the market even</text>
  <text start="542.72" dur="6.239">higher and in order to do this they need</text>
  <text start="545.569" dur="5.82">the first part of the collapse of some</text>
  <text start="548.959" dur="5.911">type of event that will bring the market</text>
  <text start="551.389" dur="5.521">down which will make people say whoa</text>
  <text start="554.87" dur="4.259">wait what just happen here they&amp;#39;ll blame</text>
  <text start="556.91" dur="4.919">it on another country the Fed will step</text>
  <text start="559.129" dur="5.63">in and say listen to save everyone what</text>
  <text start="561.829" dur="5.7">we got to do is we got to increase</text>
  <text start="564.759" dur="5.411">quantitative easing because of what this</text>
  <text start="567.529" dur="4.471">country did the economy is slowing its</text>

  <text start="573.92" dur="5.159">5,000 points seven thousand points we</text>
  <text start="576.709" dur="4.92">need to pump this back up and this is</text>
  <text start="579.079" dur="8.76">what they&amp;#39;re going to do and this is</text>
  <text start="581.629" dur="8.52">going to happen very soon okay let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="625.069" dur="4.531">premium so how much it costs it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="627.529" dur="4.381">more expensive than what he was talking</text>
  <text start="629.6" dur="5.4">about and what else did he do to help</text>
  <text start="631.91" dur="6.09">the people well if you decided not to</text>

  <text start="868.9" dur="5.46">start out small and they ramp it up</text>
  <text start="871.3" dur="6.45">until it&amp;#39;s so horrific that everyone</text>

  <text start="1409.22" dur="6.179">see how they&amp;#39;re being pushed forward</text>
  <text start="1411.529" dur="6.451">with this we also saw Syria cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1415.399" dur="4.321">and guitar and they are building up</text>
  <text start="1417.98" dur="4.47">saying that the Syrian electronic army</text>
  <text start="1419.72" dur="6.24">is becoming more advanced and they are</text>
  <text start="1422.45" dur="7.16">able to bring down systems now and you</text>
  <text start="1425.96" dur="6.42">can see how this is going to play out</text>
  <text start="1429.61" dur="5.289">okay now let&amp;#39;s move on here now there</text>
  <text start="1432.38" dur="5.37">was a report about that there is a</text>
  <text start="1434.899" dur="5.4">massive vulnerability detected in the</text>
  <text start="1437.75" dur="6.87">national power grid and there is no way</text>
  <text start="1440.299" dur="5.76">to stop what was if it&amp;#39;s attacked the</text>
  <text start="1444.62" dur="4.439">power grid there&amp;#39;s no way to stop it</text>
  <text start="1446.059" dur="5.37">according to one group of engineers the</text>
  <text start="1449.059" dur="5.25">grid is so vulnerable that it wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1451.429" dur="5.49">even require a skilled hacker to</text>
  <text start="1454.309" dur="5.97">compromise it in fact when Adam Crain</text>
  <text start="1456.919" dur="5.281">and Chris Sistrunk decided to test some</text>
  <text start="1460.279" dur="5.191">new software they were developing they</text>
  <text start="1462.2" dur="5.219">identified a vulnerability so serious</text>
  <text start="1465.47" dur="5.25">that it could literally blind</text>
  <text start="1467.419" dur="5.431">operational controls controllers to such</text>
  <text start="1470.72" dur="2.86">an extent that they would be locked out</text>
  <text start="1472.85" dur="3.25">of my</text>
  <text start="1473.58" dur="7.11">during systems and unable to maintain</text>
  <text start="1476.1" dur="6.69">grid integrity the same systems used to</text>
  <text start="1480.69" dur="4.38">maintain the u.s. power grid are also</text>
  <text start="1482.79" dur="5.01">being used in other industries like</text>
  <text start="1485.07" dur="5.82">water treatment facilities and just this</text>
  <text start="1487.8" dur="6.54">past weekend the FBI put out a warning i</text>
  <text start="1490.89" dur="6.63">think on for water treatment places of a</text>
  <text start="1494.34" dur="6.72">threat of some type of cyber terrorist</text>
  <text start="1497.52" dur="8.25">attack or just an attack on those</text>
  <text start="1501.06" dur="8.49">systems and they reported this huge and</text>
  <text start="1505.77" dur="6.15">massive vulnerability to DHS and DHS</text>
  <text start="1509.55" dur="7.29">kind of just shrugged it off and really</text>
  <text start="1511.92" dur="6.54">didn&amp;#39;t respond to them and and what</text>
  <text start="1516.84" dur="4.14">makes the vulnerabilities particularly</text>
  <text start="1518.46" dur="5.01">troubling experts say is that the</text>
  <text start="1520.98" dur="6.09">traditional firewalls that they have in</text>
  <text start="1523.47" dur="6.93">place now are ill-equipped to stop these</text>
  <text start="1527.07" dur="6.15">attacks when the master crashes it can</text>
  <text start="1530.4" dur="6.9">no longer monitor or control any and all</text>
  <text start="1533.22" dur="7.38">the substations and this to me has been</text>
  <text start="1537.3" dur="6.69">done on purpose to bring down the power</text>
  <text start="1540.6" dur="5.04">grid on when this cyber attack hits and</text>
  <text start="1543.99" dur="3.33">we have to remember and I know I said</text>
  <text start="1545.64" dur="3.6">this many many times and you&amp;#39;ve probably</text>
  <text start="1547.32" dur="4.74">seen this and heard this over and over</text>
  <text start="1549.24" dur="5.37">and over but Janet Napolitano said not</text>
  <text start="1552.06" dur="4.59">if but when a cyber attack and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1554.61" dur="4.17">been using propaganda now for over two</text>
  <text start="1556.65" dur="5.88">years about hitting the power grid</text>
  <text start="1558.78" dur="6.99">hitting financial institutions and we</text>
  <text start="1562.53" dur="6.44">have seen many many glitches on the</text>
  <text start="1565.77" dur="7.61">internet in the financial industry and</text>
  <text start="1568.97" dur="8.56">it has nothing to do with healthcare.gov</text>
  <text start="1573.38" dur="7.57">that is because those glitches are poor</text>
  <text start="1577.53" dur="6.3">programming stolen code and it shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1580.95" dur="6.54">even be up and running at this time but</text>
  <text start="1583.83" dur="11.82">what&amp;#39;s interesting that Reuters is</text>
  <text start="1587.49" dur="11.49">reporting on quantum dawn to now I</text>
  <text start="1595.65" dur="6.9">reported this back in June that they did</text>
  <text start="1598.98" dur="5.7">a simulation of cyber attacks against</text>
  <text start="1602.55" dur="4.369">the financial institutions and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1604.68" dur="6.05">just mentioning it now it</text>
  <text start="1606.919" dur="7.86">it took place this past July and now</text>
  <text start="1610.73" dur="6.84">we&amp;#39;re into October and Reuters is just</text>
  <text start="1614.779" dur="5.161">letting everyone know about what</text>
  <text start="1617.57" dur="6.589">happened back in July I find that very</text>
  <text start="1619.94" dur="8.28">interesting what I think the quantum to</text>
  <text start="1624.159" dur="6.61">was all about was in preparation for</text>
  <text start="1628.22" dur="4.86">what is coming and I think now that the</text>
  <text start="1630.769" dur="5.941">reporting on this is getting everyone</text>
  <text start="1633.08" dur="6.809">aware of it because something some type</text>
  <text start="1636.71" dur="5.219">of cyber attack is coming very soon we</text>
  <text start="1639.889" dur="4.92">also have to remember we have the second</text>
  <text start="1641.929" dur="6.75">part of the thousand Bank cyberattack</text>
  <text start="1644.809" dur="5.1">drill coming up this week and we will</text>
  <text start="1648.679" dur="4.32">have to see what happens and we also</text>
  <text start="1649.909" dur="5.7">have the power grid drill coming up in</text>
  <text start="1652.999" dur="6.24">November and there&amp;#39;s also a simulation</text>
  <text start="1655.609" dur="7.081">of a bank collapse using the white paper</text>
  <text start="1659.239" dur="6.481">the FDIC Bank of England white paper to</text>
  <text start="1662.69" dur="5.339">perform balance on collapsing banks and</text>
  <text start="1665.72" dur="7.549">we also have to remember the UK is also</text>
  <text start="1668.029" dur="7.59">reported that they are also expecting</text>
  <text start="1673.269" dur="7.691">cyberattacks against their power grid</text>
  <text start="1675.619" dur="10.8">and they see this as very dangerous just</text>
  <text start="1680.96" dur="8.87">like the u.s. now we also saw over the</text>
  <text start="1686.419" dur="10.08">weekend a warning from the FBI that</text>
  <text start="1689.83" dur="9.669">there is a terrorist attack that is</text>
  <text start="1696.499" dur="5.971">imminent in Uganda it will be a kenya</text>
  <text start="1699.499" dur="6.12">mall style terror attack and i also</text>
  <text start="1702.47" dur="5.699">mentioned that china is making a two</text>
  <text start="1705.619" dur="5.19">billion dollar deal oil deal with Uganda</text>
  <text start="1708.169" dur="4.98">and it&amp;#39;s to develop a patrolling field</text>
  <text start="1710.809" dur="4.021">in Uganda and help propel the East</text>
  <text start="1713.149" dur="4.921">African nation into the club of</text>
  <text start="1714.83" dur="5.76">oil-producing countries and we can see</text>
  <text start="1718.07" dur="5.579">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1720.59" dur="6.839">al shabaab who are supposedly leading</text>
  <text start="1723.649" dur="7.081">this attack and the FBI is warning all</text>
  <text start="1727.429" dur="6.391">citizens in Uganda and the embassy out</text>
  <text start="1730.73" dur="5.879">there they are building this up to show</text>
  <text start="1733.82" dur="6.24">they can reach anywhere they can attack</text>
  <text start="1736.609" dur="6.601">anywhere and eventually this will</text>
  <text start="1740.06" dur="6.66">art to happen in the US and this is like</text>
  <text start="1743.21" dur="7.95">the run-up to the main event and this is</text>
  <text start="1746.72" dur="7.2">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now listen</text>
  <text start="1751.16" dur="5.34">everyone thanks a lot for listening be</text>
