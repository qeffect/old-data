  <text start="65.25" dur="4.229">something like this before and if we go</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="5.16">back to nineteen twenty nine Europe was</text>

  <text start="114.539" dur="8.46">well US manufacturing it printed at 53.9</text>
  <text start="119.249" dur="5.82">it missed epic expectations falling for</text>
  <text start="122.999" dur="6.421">their fourth straight month to the</text>
  <text start="125.069" dur="7.321">lowest since january 2014 market is out</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="7.289">there and they are warning this suggests</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="6.959">a slowdown and it could become more</text>
  <text start="136.709" dur="3.711">entrenched as we go through 2015 so it</text>
  <text start="139.349" dur="3.021">does not look</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="5.73">good companies are citing greater</text>
  <text start="142.37" dur="5.91">uncertainty about the outlook and if we</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="4.23">look even further than that u.s.</text>
  <text start="148.28" dur="4.35">construction spending in December drop</text>
  <text start="150.38" dur="4.8">point three percent they expected to</text>
  <text start="152.63" dur="5.1">rise point four percent but instead it</text>
  <text start="155.18" dur="6.12">dropped point three percent this is the</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="8.339">biggest monthly drop since june new</text>
  <text start="161.3" dur="7.49">orders that number came in at 53.5 this</text>
  <text start="166.069" dur="5.851">was the lowest number since before</text>
  <text start="168.79" dur="5.83">january of 2014 when they told us the</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="5.01">snow and the bad weather was the problem</text>
  <text start="174.62" dur="4.47">but the economy that&amp;#39;s why the gdp was</text>
  <text start="176.93" dur="4.559">so low well guess what there really</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="4.649">hasn&amp;#39;t been that much of bad weather and</text>
  <text start="181.489" dur="4.261">again when the bad weather does hit the</text>
  <text start="183.739" dur="3.571">United States it hits in certain</text>
  <text start="185.75" dur="4.38">sections it doesn&amp;#39;t hit the entire</text>
  <text start="187.31" dur="6.87">country all at once because as we know</text>
  <text start="190.13" dur="6.419">the South the mid-south the west south</text>
  <text start="194.18" dur="3.839">regions they&amp;#39;re really not having bad</text>
  <text start="196.549" dur="5.841">weather and there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong in</text>
  <text start="198.019" dur="8.611">those areas as we know the United States</text>
  <text start="202.39" dur="6.12">Saudi Arabia have been suppressing the</text>
  <text start="206.63" dur="4.53">oil prices putting pressure on Russia</text>
  <text start="208.51" dur="5.44">Venezuela Brazil and many other</text>
  <text start="211.16" dur="4.49">countries now there&amp;#39;s companies here in</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="3.81">America because it&amp;#39;s having some type of</text>
  <text start="215.65" dur="4.03">boomerang effect because they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="217.76" dur="3.75">you know something since the oil prices</text>
  <text start="219.68" dur="4.589">are going down it really doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="221.51" dur="4.49">any sense to keep the drilling going and</text>
  <text start="224.269" dur="6.121">they&amp;#39;re calling off the drilling until</text>
  <text start="226" dur="7.299">oil prices rebound and because of this</text>
  <text start="230.39" dur="4.62">the job situation not because of the oil</text>
  <text start="233.299" dur="4.021">workers and not because they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="5.699">less drilling is the surrounding</text>
  <text start="237.32" dur="5.639">businesses are hurting these services</text>
  <text start="240.709" dur="4.171">that pop up around these drilling sites</text>
  <text start="242.959" dur="4.441">like restaurant bars construction and</text>
  <text start="244.88" dur="5.01">more are feeling the slow down as well</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="4.669">people are not visiting these areas</text>
  <text start="249.89" dur="4.409">they&amp;#39;re not coming into the area&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.069" dur="4.331">businesses are not growing in these</text>
  <text start="254.299" dur="4.921">areas all of a sudden everything has</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="4.889">come to a standstill now we understand</text>
  <text start="259.22" dur="4.8">the president has been working for a</text>
  <text start="261.289" dur="5.311">very long time to establish relations</text>
  <text start="264.02" dur="4.11">with Cuba now is this a bad thing now I</text>
  <text start="266.6" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t think so but it&amp;#39;s part of a</text>
  <text start="268.13" dur="3.779">different agenda it&amp;#39;s not what everybody</text>
  <text start="269.57" dur="4.25">thinks and we can see right now and as</text>
  <text start="271.909" dur="4.521">we know Russia China</text>
  <text start="273.82" dur="4.71">they have been involved with Cuba Russia</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="4.23">has been talking with Cuba they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="278.53" dur="4.38">exploring for oil they&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="280.66" dur="3.75">about setting up a base in Cuba and of</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="3.75">course here comes United States because</text>
  <text start="284.41" dur="4.65">as we know wherever rush wherever Russia</text>
  <text start="286.66" dur="5.43">and China are the United States has to</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="5.7">follow now Cuba produces over about</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="6.24">50,000 barrels per day of oil and relies</text>
  <text start="294.76" dur="6.39">on Venezuela for around a hundred</text>
  <text start="298.33" dur="5.4">thousand barrels per day however since</text>
  <text start="301.15" dur="5.67">oil prices are being suppressed then as</text>
  <text start="303.73" dur="8.19">well as economy is reeling from the oil</text>
  <text start="306.82" dur="6.78">price suppression Cuban officials want</text>
  <text start="311.92" dur="4.59">to avoid the impacts of sudden drop in</text>
  <text start="313.6" dur="5.07">Venezuela support the commitment by Cuba</text>
  <text start="316.51" dur="5.61">and the u.s. to normalize relations may</text>
  <text start="318.67" dur="6.12">allow Cuba to buy more oil on the open</text>
  <text start="322.12" dur="5.34">market instead of Venezuela and of</text>
  <text start="324.79" dur="4.32">course as Cuba purchases oil from that</text>
  <text start="327.46" dur="3.72">Venezuela they don&amp;#39;t get any type of</text>
  <text start="329.11" dur="4.41">piece of the action because they can use</text>
  <text start="331.18" dur="4.83">any currency and they don&amp;#39;t have to use</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="3.81">the US dollar and this is why the United</text>
  <text start="336.01" dur="4.26">States has been trying to get into</text>
  <text start="337.33" dur="4.92">Venezuela trying to overthrow the</text>
  <text start="340.27" dur="4.62">government to place the natural</text>
  <text start="342.25" dur="4.62">resources on the US dollar and to put up</text>
  <text start="344.89" dur="4.17">it put in a puppet government and we can</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="3.84">see right now the United States Saudi</text>
  <text start="349.06" dur="4.23">Arabia they have been putting pressure</text>
  <text start="350.71" dur="6.48">on all of these countries and we can see</text>
  <text start="353.29" dur="5.52">this opens up a huge door for the United</text>
  <text start="357.19" dur="3.78">States and the United States companies</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="4.47">to bring expertise and experience to tap</text>
  <text start="360.97" dur="4.98">into the country&amp;#39;s offshore revenues</text>
  <text start="363.28" dur="5.28">have Cuba go out let&amp;#39;s say the Middle</text>
  <text start="365.95" dur="5.52">East and purchase that oil using US</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="4.32">dollars to pump up the dollar once again</text>
  <text start="371.47" dur="5.67">and this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="372.88" dur="7.65">out there now we understand that this</text>
  <text start="377.14" dur="5.61">year 2015 is most likely going to be a</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="4.95">really bad year for business we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="5.4">to see a lot of layoffs we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="385.48" dur="4.47">see real estate plunging yes we might</text>
  <text start="388.15" dur="2.76">see the short-term bump up because</text>
  <text start="389.95" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re trying to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="390.91" dur="5.31">possibly can to prop up the dollar</text>
  <text start="394.03" dur="4.5">before the main event occurs at the</text>
  <text start="396.22" dur="5.9">collapse hits but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="398.53" dur="7.02">situation now we understand the bankers</text>
  <text start="402.12" dur="5.06">the central bankers have been preparing</text>
  <text start="405.55" dur="4.63">for something for</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="5.85">a while by different legislation that</text>
  <text start="410.18" dur="6.66">they passed like ensuring derivatives</text>
  <text start="413.03" dur="6.389">using the FDIC creating baylon documents</text>
  <text start="416.84" dur="4.859">and each one of the country&amp;#39;s copying</text>
  <text start="419.419" dur="5.011">this and stealing money from the banks</text>
  <text start="421.699" dur="5.431">to prop themselves up and when we really</text>
  <text start="424.43" dur="5.13">look at this the banks the bank the bank</text>
  <text start="427.13" dur="5.55">stirs are stealing our assets in</text>
  <text start="429.56" dur="5.609">preparation for them to economically</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="5.34">survive what is coming they understand</text>
  <text start="435.169" dur="4.291">and they&amp;#39;re trying to get as many assets</text>
  <text start="438.02" dur="3.75">as they possibly come the Seventh</text>
  <text start="439.46" dur="4.23">Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that when</text>
  <text start="441.77" dur="4.47">you put money into the bank you have</text>
  <text start="443.69" dur="6.99">transferred ownership of that money to</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="7.049">the bank the g20 nations declared money</text>
  <text start="450.68" dur="4.53">in your bank account to not be money</text>
  <text start="453.289" dur="4.741">therefore the FDIC insurance for your</text>
  <text start="455.21" dur="4.23">savings really doesn&amp;#39;t exist at this</text>
  <text start="458.03" dur="4.139">point if you really think about it and</text>
  <text start="459.44" dur="5.28">also we have to understand if your bank</text>
  <text start="462.169" dur="7.921">is hit with some type of cyber attack</text>
  <text start="464.72" dur="8.52">the FDIC does not cover that money it on</text>
  <text start="470.09" dur="6.84">the FDIC only covers if the bank goes</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="5.669">under the MERS mortgage fraud is ongoing</text>
  <text start="476.93" dur="5.01">and homeowners are still having their</text>
  <text start="478.909" dur="5.401">home stolen without legal justification</text>
  <text start="481.94" dur="4.229">the Federal Reserve in 2012 began to</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="4.2">print money to the tune of 40 billion of</text>
  <text start="486.169" dur="5.521">dollars a month in order to purchase the</text>
  <text start="488.51" dur="5.58">mortgage-backed securities the bankers</text>
  <text start="491.69" dur="4.319">have practice stealing the secured</text>

  <text start="500.21" dur="5.76">funds in April of 2013 and we talked</text>
  <text start="503.78" dur="4.169">about this quite a bit the bank the</text>
  <text start="505.97" dur="4.319">bankers are manipulating the gold price</text>
  <text start="507.949" dur="4.801">we know are and remember back then</text>
  <text start="510.289" dur="4.29">Goldman Sachs said hey gold is to be</text>
  <text start="512.75" dur="4.289">going to is going to be going down</text>
  <text start="514.579" dur="5.46">everyone should sell as soon as they did</text>
  <text start="517.039" dur="5.461">it Goldman came in and bought as much as</text>
  <text start="520.039" dur="4.231">they possibly can now the only left</text>
  <text start="522.5" dur="5.339">thing left for the bankers to do at this</text>
  <text start="524.27" dur="6.03">point is to steal your bank account with</text>
  <text start="527.839" dur="5.31">balance and all they need right now is</text>
  <text start="530.3" dur="4.979">the correct crisis the event that will</text>
  <text start="533.149" dur="4.201">allow them to do this and if you notice</text>
  <text start="535.279" dur="4.771">in the past couple of months they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="537.35" dur="3.299">been ramping up on cyber attacks blaming</text>

  <text start="546.05" dur="5.219">China we see Iran we see Syria and of</text>
  <text start="549.199" dur="4.08">course this is all propaganda this will</text>
  <text start="551.269" dur="4.17">fit into their false flag event and</text>
  <text start="553.279" dur="3.631">they&amp;#39;ll try to convince everyone that it</text>
  <text start="555.439" dur="3.9">was one of these countries and as we</text>
  <text start="556.91" dur="4.89">know it will be an inside job and the</text>
  <text start="559.339" dur="4.771">last thing for them to do is to get at</text>
