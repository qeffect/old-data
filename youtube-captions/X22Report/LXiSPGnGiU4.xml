  <text start="61.5" dur="5.88">is August 10th 2018 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="64.53" dur="5.13">episode is the economic structure is</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="4.83">being dismantled to make way for the new</text>
  <text start="69.66" dur="5.43">one let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.21" dur="4.5">financial news now we know the Fed is</text>
  <text start="75.09" dur="3.33">out there and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="4.2">telling us that there is no inflation</text>
  <text start="78.42" dur="4.38">but the everyday person well they see</text>
  <text start="80.91" dur="3.84">inflation and we know that inflation is</text>
  <text start="82.8" dur="4.44">being stuffed into many different areas</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="4.92">of the economic sector and we know that</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="5.79">inflation is being stuffed into the</text>
  <text start="89.67" dur="6.27">stock market into education into the</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="4.979">housing market across the ocean to other</text>
  <text start="95.94" dur="4.2">countries and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="98.009" dur="4.441">inflation here in the United States now</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing inflation but once</text>
  <text start="102.45" dur="4.62">again they&amp;#39;ve been pushing it off into</text>
  <text start="104.91" dur="3.84">different areas so you really can&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="107.07" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;ve been creating a lot of currency</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="5.28">but not allowing it to hit the everyday</text>
  <text start="111.96" dur="4.29">person they&amp;#39;ve been shoving it back into</text>
  <text start="114.03" dur="5.13">the stock market putting it into the</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="6.539">housing market and now we see consumer</text>
  <text start="119.16" dur="7.26">prices they have met expectations by</text>
  <text start="122.789" dur="5.401">rising 2.9 percent year-on-year this is</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="5.789">the fastest rate of increase since</text>
  <text start="128.19" dur="7.35">December of 2011 and all of this is due</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="5.851">to rent and shelter costs and this is</text>
  <text start="135.54" dur="5.79">the highest CPI that we&amp;#39;ve seen since</text>
  <text start="138.06" dur="6">2008 now when we look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="141.33" dur="5.31">one of the biggest drivers was a surge</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="3.69">in shelter costs shelter inflation rose</text>
  <text start="146.64" dur="2.01">about three point five percent</text>
  <text start="147.75" dur="3.209">year-on-year</text>
  <text start="148.65" dur="4.83">rent inflation rose about three point</text>
  <text start="150.959" dur="5.431">six percent year-on-year and this is a</text>
  <text start="153.48" dur="5.55">major problem because as we know wages</text>
  <text start="156.39" dur="5.73">are not increasing when we see inflation</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="4.59">here we&amp;#39;re going to see prices of many</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="3.449">different products which means the value</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="5.46">of the dollar is decreasing it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="165.569" dur="4.801">to go up but wages they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="169.08" dur="2.4">go anywhere they haven&amp;#39;t been going</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="3.47">anywhere actually they&amp;#39;ve been declining</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="4.38">in a lot of the different sectors and</text>
  <text start="173.84" dur="4.24">this is going to make it very very</text>
  <text start="175.86" dur="3.87">difficult for many individuals</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="4.079">especially those people that are on a</text>
  <text start="179.73" dur="5.429">fixed income it&amp;#39;s going to be very very</text>
  <text start="182.159" dur="3.981">tough we see the Swiss National Bank</text>
  <text start="185.159" dur="3.441">they</text>
  <text start="186.14" dur="4.17">have been keeping the stock market</text>
  <text start="188.6" dur="3.57">propped up and when everyone was saying</text>
  <text start="190.31" dur="3.42">no the central bank does get involved in</text>
  <text start="192.17" dur="3.03">the stock market well here we have</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="3.57">evidence and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="4.65">this for quite a while where the Swiss</text>
  <text start="197.3" dur="5.25">central bank they are purchasing the</text>
  <text start="199.85" dur="4.38">fing stocks now what we look what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.55" dur="4.02">looking at here is that the Swiss</text>
  <text start="204.23" dur="4.59">National Bank they boosted their</text>
  <text start="206.57" dur="6">holdings of US stocks to eighty-seven</text>
  <text start="208.82" dur="5.34">point five billion up 6.6% or 5.4</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="4.08">billion from the eighty two billion at</text>
  <text start="214.16" dur="5.37">the end of the first quarter and just</text>
  <text start="216.65" dur="5.28">shy of their all-time high now on a</text>
  <text start="219.53" dur="5.52">share basis the Swiss National Bank</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="5.49">added thirty three point six 59 million</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="3.99">shares to its holdings of US stocks</text>
  <text start="227.42" dur="3.45">which at the end of the second quarter</text>
  <text start="229.04" dur="5.37">stood at one point three two zero</text>
  <text start="230.87" dur="6.3">billion now some notable observations in</text>
  <text start="234.41" dur="4.32">all this in the second quarter after the</text>
  <text start="237.17" dur="4.05">Swiss National Bank printed money out of</text>
  <text start="238.73" dur="5.789">thin air it then added four point eight</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="4.92">five million shares of AT&amp;amp;T six hundred</text>
  <text start="244.519" dur="3.781">and seventy-three thousand shares of</text>
  <text start="246.14" dur="4.83">Microsoft three hundred and five</text>
  <text start="248.3" dur="4.26">thousand shares of Apple two hundred and</text>
  <text start="250.97" dur="4.92">seventy two thousand shares of Facebook</text>
  <text start="252.56" dur="5.519">forty six thousand shares of Amazon and</text>
  <text start="255.89" dur="4.77">according to some calculation the Swiss</text>
  <text start="258.079" dur="6.09">National Bank portfolio now generates</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="6.96">over 1 billion worth of dividends they</text>
  <text start="264.169" dur="7.471">print money and we ship them our profits</text>
  <text start="267.62" dur="6.87">and as we can see that they and many</text>
  <text start="271.64" dur="5.22">others have been propping up the stock</text>
  <text start="274.49" dur="2.88">market it&amp;#39;s not based on anything</text>
  <text start="276.86" dur="2.94">anymore</text>
  <text start="277.37" dur="4.799">it&amp;#39;s completely manipulated and this is</text>
  <text start="279.8" dur="3.81">manipulation I mean think about it if</text>
  <text start="282.169" dur="2.551">you have the ability just to print money</text>
  <text start="283.61" dur="4.59">out of thin air and then go and buy</text>
  <text start="284.72" dur="5.88">stocks and own parts of companies that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.2" dur="5.73">incredible and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="290.6" dur="6.54">right now to keep this entire system</text>
  <text start="293.93" dur="5.31">operational under the central bank</text>
  <text start="297.14" dur="4.26">system remember we talked about Jacob</text>
  <text start="299.24" dur="5.19">Rothschild yesterday and how he said</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="4.079">that the new world order it&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="304.43" dur="3.51">apart and of course they&amp;#39;re blaming</text>
  <text start="305.479" dur="4.231">Trump and the policies that his economic</text>
  <text start="307.94" dur="4.4">policies with tariffs and things like</text>
  <text start="309.71" dur="6.11">that and what he&amp;#39;s really saying is that</text>
  <text start="312.34" dur="5.8">everything that the Rothschilds and</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="4.2">everyone else everything that they built</text>
  <text start="318.14" dur="6.47">where they were looking to have this</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="5.73">government one world type of order it is</text>
  <text start="324.61" dur="4.47">falling apart right now</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="5.4">and they&amp;#39;re going to try to save it by</text>
  <text start="329.08" dur="4.14">blaming it on Trump and his economic</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="4.38">policies and it&amp;#39;s not just Trump we know</text>
  <text start="333.22" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s Patriots behind the scenes but this</text>
  <text start="335.53" dur="4.47">is their plan right now because they</text>
  <text start="337.15" dur="4.23">have nothing left and they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="340" dur="2.31">that everything is starting to fall</text>
  <text start="341.38" dur="2.88">apart and we&amp;#39;re going to be talking</text>
  <text start="342.31" dur="4.53">about this a little bit later in the in</text>
  <text start="344.26" dur="5.04">the next report where a lot of people</text>
  <text start="346.84" dur="4.05">now are joining the movement I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="349.3" dur="3.42">about people in different parts of the</text>
  <text start="350.89" dur="3.51">world where they&amp;#39;re trying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="352.72" dur="3.57">figuring it out that there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="354.4" dur="4.02">wrong and they&amp;#39;re banding together and</text>
  <text start="356.29" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re going up against their leaders</text>
  <text start="358.42" dur="6.21">going up against the corporate media but</text>
  <text start="361.69" dur="5.55">how do you get rid of a central bank</text>
  <text start="364.63" dur="3.99">system where you have the deep state the</text>
  <text start="367.24" dur="4.2">central bank the Rothschild</text>
  <text start="368.62" dur="5.76">and the rest continually pushing their</text>
  <text start="371.44" dur="6.42">agenda where they&amp;#39;ve taken the u.s.</text>
  <text start="374.38" dur="5.63">moved all the jobs out overseas they</text>
  <text start="377.86" dur="5.1">destroyed the infrastructure and</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="6.13">basically destroyed what the u.s. used</text>
  <text start="382.96" dur="4.98">to be and you have to remember when</text>
  <text start="386.14" dur="4.529">Obama was president and presidents</text>
  <text start="387.94" dur="4.95">before him they were all doing this this</text>
  <text start="390.669" dur="4.831">is not just one person this was a group</text>
  <text start="392.89" dur="5.94">of individuals that were all doing the</text>
  <text start="395.5" dur="6.6">same exact thing and basically they took</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="7.04">away the free markets they made</text>
  <text start="402.1" dur="5.879">everything unfair unjust they put in</text>
  <text start="405.87" dur="4.35">redistributionist policies from</text>
  <text start="407.979" dur="4.831">Obamacare to massive government stimulus</text>
  <text start="410.22" dur="5.05">spending and bailout programs and</text>
  <text start="412.81" dur="5.43">attempt to re-engineer and command the</text>
  <text start="415.27" dur="5.459">US economy when these policies</text>
  <text start="418.24" dur="6.39">inevitably produced what socialism</text>
  <text start="420.729" dur="5.761">always produces hardship sluggishness we</text>
  <text start="424.63" dur="3.18">were told to suck it up and accept the</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="3.51">new normal this is the way it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="427.81" dur="5.22">be this is how you see an economy</text>
  <text start="430" dur="4.77">improve this is what they told us you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.03" dur="4.59">going to see anemic economic growth</text>
  <text start="434.77" dur="4.8">you&amp;#39;re gonna see bad trade deals you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.62" dur="4.74">gonna see the death of manufacturing</text>
  <text start="439.57" dur="5.22">you&amp;#39;re gonna see all of this and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="442.36" dur="5.28">just gonna have to deal with it because</text>
  <text start="444.79" dur="5.129">really what was happening here is they</text>
  <text start="447.64" dur="4.87">were preparing for a new system at the</text>
  <text start="449.919" dur="5.231">end of an old central bank system this</text>
  <text start="452.51" dur="4.89">what it looks like because it&amp;#39;s failing</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="4.35">and this is what they were trying to</text>
  <text start="457.4" dur="3.84">convince us of that this was normal and</text>
  <text start="459.5" dur="3.75">people were buying into it people were</text>
  <text start="461.24" dur="3.87">saying yes this is what a recovery looks</text>
  <text start="463.25" dur="4.86">like you know you only get up to 1.8</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="4.89">percent GDP you know all manufacturing</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="4.83">has to be moved out out of the country</text>
  <text start="470" dur="5.15">to overseas no this is not what a</text>
  <text start="472.94" dur="4.8">prosperous economy should look like</text>
  <text start="475.15" dur="4.21">retail shouldn&amp;#39;t be contracting we</text>
  <text start="477.74" dur="3.09">shouldn&amp;#39;t have to manipulate our GDP</text>
  <text start="479.36" dur="4.02">numbers we shouldn&amp;#39;t have to manipulate</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="3.96">our unemployment numbers we shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="483.38" dur="4.41">have to do all this we shouldn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="484.79" dur="5.4">have the central bank buy up the stocks</text>
  <text start="487.79" dur="4.59">in the stock market we shouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="490.19" dur="5.01">the central bake creating currency out</text>

  <text start="505.28" dur="4.17">move it around so no one can figure out</text>
  <text start="506.69" dur="4.67">what&amp;#39;s really going on and they needed</text>
  <text start="509.45" dur="5.19">to do this to keep the system going</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="5.35">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.64" dur="3.839">being all dismantled and when you</text>
  <text start="516.71" dur="4.08">dismantle something like this the old</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="4.611">you have to make way for something new</text>
  <text start="520.79" dur="5.22">but we&amp;#39;re gonna go through some pain and</text>

  <text start="606.829" dur="5.76">this entire system that we&amp;#39;re in this is</text>
  <text start="609.74" dur="4.95">an old central bank system they were</text>
  <text start="612.589" dur="4.141">preparing to move it someplace else and</text>
  <text start="614.69" dur="4.709">restart it because they knew that it was</text>
