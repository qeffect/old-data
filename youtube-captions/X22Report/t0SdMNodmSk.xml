  <text start="55.3" dur="2.64">sling the coin cross the counter and ask</text>
  <text start="57.4" dur="1.83">for another</text>
  <text start="57.94" dur="3.299">chances are that coin would have been a</text>
  <text start="59.23" dur="5.1">silver dollar they use real silver coins</text>
  <text start="61.239" dur="4.921">back then between 1878 and 1921 it would</text>
  <text start="64.33" dur="3.149">have been the Morgans silver dollar but</text>
  <text start="66.16" dur="2.64">they went out of circulation when the</text>
  <text start="67.479" dur="3.121">price of silver went up they&amp;#39;re getting</text>

  <text start="86.47" dur="6.72">collapse financial news now as we can</text>
  <text start="89.17" dur="7.01">see the central bankers they never do</text>
  <text start="93.19" dur="6.15">anything that will benefit the people I</text>
  <text start="96.18" dur="5.95">mean prime example is the brexit now we</text>
  <text start="99.34" dur="4.98">talked about how there&amp;#39;s a deal well it</text>
  <text start="102.13" dur="5.34">wasn&amp;#39;t for the people it&amp;#39;s weighted</text>
  <text start="104.32" dur="5.49">towards the EU the central bankers this</text>
  <text start="107.47" dur="4.59">is why the EU was out there threatening</text>
  <text start="109.81" dur="7.349">the people of the UK that you better</text>
  <text start="112.06" dur="8.76">accept this or else and you can tell by</text>
  <text start="117.159" dur="6.441">their threats that they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="120.82" dur="5.46">to go any other way except their way and</text>
  <text start="123.6" dur="4.12">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is most likely</text>
  <text start="126.28" dur="4.31">this plan is going to be in a</text>
  <text start="127.72" dur="4.769">transitional phase for a very long time</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="5.14">because we&amp;#39;ve said this from the</text>
  <text start="132.489" dur="5.551">beginning the central banks they want</text>
  <text start="135.73" dur="3.99">total control now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="138.04" dur="3.229">interesting is that we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="139.72" dur="4.769">has Andrew Jackson hanging on his wall</text>
  <text start="141.269" dur="4.841">this is the signal that he&amp;#39;s going after</text>
  <text start="144.489" dur="4.671">the central banks this is the ultimate</text>
  <text start="146.11" dur="6.03">plan he&amp;#39;s already mentioned that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.16" dur="6.609">not a globalist he&amp;#39;s getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="152.14" dur="8.27">globalist trade deals he&amp;#39;s pushing</text>
  <text start="155.769" dur="7.411">bilateral trade deals and he&amp;#39;s unwinding</text>
  <text start="160.41" dur="4.24">everything the central bank the deep</text>
  <text start="163.18" dur="4.38">state has done</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="4.32">to our economy he&amp;#39;s removing a lot of</text>
  <text start="167.56" dur="2.97">the regulations I mean can you do</text>
  <text start="168.97" dur="3.93">everything at once absolutely not</text>
  <text start="170.53" dur="4.08">completely impossible think about how</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="3.929">many years it took to put all these</text>
  <text start="174.61" dur="5.36">regulations into place to put all these</text>
  <text start="176.829" dur="5.791">tax laws into place to push</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="3.25">manufacturing businesses out of the</text>
  <text start="182.62" dur="3.089">country</text>
  <text start="183.22" dur="4.469">can he just reverse everything in two</text>
  <text start="185.709" dur="4.17">years three years four years no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.689" dur="4.561">gonna be very very difficult because</text>
  <text start="189.879" dur="4.56">they made it so intertwined that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.25" dur="4.079">very difficult to unwind all this but</text>
  <text start="194.439" dur="3.841">he&amp;#39;s doing it and not just him alone</text>
  <text start="196.329" dur="5.91">there&amp;#39;s many people working on this</text>
  <text start="198.28" dur="6.78">together and we know from cue where they</text>
  <text start="202.239" dur="5.551">gave us this list of Rothschild banks</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="5.549">and said this is the target the central</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="5.64">bank this is the ultimate goal is to get</text>
  <text start="210.609" dur="4.591">rid of the Rost route system we see that</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="5.279">Trump was out there and he is</text>
  <text start="215.2" dur="6.629">criticizing the brexit plan now he came</text>
  <text start="218.709" dur="5.011">out and he criticized Theresa May saying</text>
  <text start="221.829" dur="5.461">the divorce deal she has negotiate with</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="5.669">the EU jeopardizes jeopardizes Britain&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.29" dur="4.529">ability to seal a trade deal with</text>
  <text start="229.389" dur="5.31">America you know what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="231.819" dur="4.861">about this he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s hammering away at</text>
  <text start="234.699" dur="5.341">May saying this is an awful deal which</text>
  <text start="236.68" dur="5.85">it is may is not working in the best</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="5.159">interest of the people this is not</text>
  <text start="242.53" dur="4.859">really what the people want she&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="245.199" dur="6.481">along with the elite the establishment</text>
  <text start="247.389" dur="8.401">the central bankers and Trump said it is</text>
  <text start="251.68" dur="8.7">a great deal for the EU but not so much</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="7.17">for Britain yes this is exactly right so</text>
  <text start="260.38" dur="6.18">he&amp;#39;s telling me this is a bad deal and</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="5.85">he&amp;#39;s also saying listen we know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.56" dur="4.349">going on here this deal that is put</text>
  <text start="268.81" dur="4.56">together it&amp;#39;s weighted towards the</text>
  <text start="270.909" dur="4.021">central bank and this is why he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="273.37" dur="3.39">there and he&amp;#39;s pointing the finger yeah</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="5.88">this is a great deal for the EU now if</text>
  <text start="276.76" dur="7.379">it was any other President Obama Clinton</text>
  <text start="280.81" dur="5.34">Bush they would have said wow what a</text>
  <text start="284.139" dur="4.171">great deal the people should take it</text>
  <text start="286.15" dur="6">were behind you they would never call</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="7.56">out the EU or the central banks but here</text>
  <text start="292.15" dur="5.57">we are again pointing the finger at the</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="4.43">central bank</text>
  <text start="297.72" dur="5.22">he went on to say right now as the deal</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="4.44">stands they may not be able to trade</text>
  <text start="302.94" dur="4.38">with the US and I don&amp;#39;t think they want</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="6.45">that at all that would be a very big</text>
  <text start="307.32" dur="5.42">negative for the deal and Trump argue</text>
  <text start="311.19" dur="5.1">that may should restart negotiations</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="6.79">with Brussels with a view to secure in</text>
  <text start="316.29" dur="7.23">better terms for Britain he knows this</text>
  <text start="319.53" dur="6.36">is another lopsided deal pushed by the</text>
  <text start="323.52" dur="4.5">central bankers if you look back in time</text>
  <text start="325.89" dur="5.91">with the US and all the other countries</text>
  <text start="328.02" dur="6.12">around the world they push their own</text>
  <text start="331.8" dur="3.57">deals they don&amp;#39;t care what the people</text>
  <text start="334.14" dur="4.47">think they don&amp;#39;t care what the people</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="6.33">want it&amp;#39;s what they want why do you</text>
  <text start="338.61" dur="4.47">think they created the World Trade</text>
  <text start="341.7" dur="4.11">Organization why do you think they</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="4.8">created the IMF the biz why do they tell</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="5.85">us that gold is no good why do they</text>
  <text start="347.88" dur="5.64">demonize Bitcoin in particular because</text>
  <text start="351.66" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re preparing to create their own</text>
  <text start="353.52" dur="6.93">cryptocurrency they are preparing to</text>
  <text start="356.85" dur="7.71">centralize and control a digital</text>
  <text start="360.45" dur="6.93">currency that&amp;#39;s their entire plan all</text>
  <text start="364.56" dur="3.75">along and if you really look at Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="367.38" dur="2.82">you look at all the other</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="4.23">cryptocurrencies actually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="5.25">decentralized and the central bank can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="372.54" dur="6.54">control them that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="375.45" dur="6.06">afraid of a currency system that</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="4.71">competes with theirs and might be better</text>
  <text start="381.51" dur="4.23">than theirs and people might recognize</text>
  <text start="383.79" dur="3.66">it and people might say you know</text>
  <text start="385.74" dur="3.54">something why do we need the central</text>
  <text start="387.45" dur="5.3">bank but don&amp;#39;t worry their days are</text>
  <text start="389.28" dur="6.63">numbered because the ultimate goal is</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="5.71">complete transparency to let everyone</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="6.69">see what the central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="7.709">up to that&amp;#39;s the ultimate plan in all of</text>
  <text start="402.6" dur="7.11">this now what we&amp;#39;re seeing in the</text>
  <text start="406.169" dur="7.171">economy is that it&amp;#39;s deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="409.71" dur="5.85">very quickly and Trump had a certain</text>
  <text start="413.34" dur="5.579">period of time along with the Patriots</text>
  <text start="415.56" dur="5.85">who are working with him to do as much</text>
  <text start="418.919" dur="5.761">as he possibly could before the entire</text>
  <text start="421.41" dur="5.58">system fell apart now we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="5.19">consumer confidence and it looks like</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="4.14">that is fading right now and people are</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="3.36">becoming worried</text>
  <text start="431.13" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re seeing like GM for instance</text>
  <text start="433.23" dur="3.96">where they&amp;#39;re closing plants people are</text>
  <text start="434.79" dur="3.66">being laid off Trump is now lashing out</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="2.85">at GM saying listen we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="438.45" dur="3.63">cutting your subsidies this is</text>
  <text start="440.04" dur="2.7">ridiculous and we know it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="442.08" dur="3.33">happening to the</text>
  <text start="442.74" dur="6.9">automobile-manufacturing they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="445.41" dur="6.99">lying to everyone about how well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="5.76">really doing actually that is the same</text>
  <text start="452.4" dur="5.88">with almost every other piece of the</text>
  <text start="455.4" dur="4.71">economy where they just told people yeah</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="4.05">look it&amp;#39;s fantastic</text>
  <text start="460.11" dur="4.17">oh but by the way don&amp;#39;t let anyone see</text>
  <text start="462.33" dur="3.87">that we&amp;#39;re channel stuffing Lots don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="464.28" dur="3.84">let anyone know that as we put more and</text>
  <text start="466.2" dur="4.8">more cars into the lot we we count those</text>
  <text start="468.12" dur="4.23">as a sales and then we try to get the</text>
  <text start="471" dur="3.03">subprime people and then the sub</text>
  <text start="472.35" dur="5.58">subprime people then we try to give</text>
  <text start="474.03" dur="6.23">incentives many incentives to push these</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="5.73">cars and a lot of these people are</text>
  <text start="480.26" dur="5.98">delinquent on their payments and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.66" dur="5.46">all starting to show up now and Trump is</text>
  <text start="486.24" dur="6.15">looking out towards the future and</text>
  <text start="489.12" dur="6.24">saying what is going on here and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="492.39" dur="5.55">starting to realize that many parts of</text>
  <text start="495.36" dur="6.27">these corporations the manufacturers</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;ve been lying and you can see just</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="4.74">by his tweets he&amp;#39;s getting a little bit</text>
  <text start="503.7" dur="4.08">angry here but when we look at consumer</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="4.44">confidence and we look at the savings</text>
  <text start="507.78" dur="5.85">rate there&amp;#39;s a strange correlation with</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="5.039">what happens with the economy when</text>
  <text start="513.63" dur="7.08">consumer confidence reaches a certain</text>
  <text start="515.849" dur="8.461">point then starts to decline rapidly all</text>
  <text start="520.71" dur="7.29">of a sudden we enter a recession now at</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="7.35">the same time as confidence is moving up</text>
  <text start="528" dur="6.21">the saving rates of the American people</text>
  <text start="531.66" dur="5.01">that is in decline so we have confidence</text>
  <text start="534.21" dur="4.74">moving up saving rates moving down and</text>
  <text start="536.67" dur="5.52">when confidence hits a peak and the</text>
  <text start="538.95" dur="6.69">savings rate declines to a peak all of a</text>
  <text start="542.19" dur="5.76">sudden we enter a recession and people</text>
  <text start="545.64" dur="6.06">are spending money they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="547.95" dur="5.1">have yes you might feel good and of</text>
  <text start="551.7" dur="3.63">course what the central bankers normally</text>
  <text start="553.05" dur="4.53">do is they pump up these housing prices</text>
  <text start="555.33" dur="3.93">and when people see their housing prices</text>
  <text start="557.58" dur="4.259">move up they feel good they feel</text>
  <text start="559.26" dur="4.35">comfortable they say he&amp;#39;ll look look we</text>
  <text start="561.839" dur="2.521">have all this money in our house this is</text>
  <text start="563.61" dur="1.23">fantastic</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="2.72">so</text>
  <text start="564.84" dur="5.73">thing happens we can fall back on that</text>
  <text start="567.08" dur="5.35">so you are feeling comfortable you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.57" dur="4.89">feeling good and you go out and you</text>
  <text start="572.43" dur="4.86">purchase things that&amp;#39;s how the mindset</text>
  <text start="575.46" dur="4.35">works this is what&amp;#39;s been happening for</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="8.69">many many years what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="579.81" dur="10.77">now is the opposite home prices they are</text>
  <text start="585.98" dur="7.27">declining right now Case Shiller is even</text>
  <text start="590.58" dur="7.53">reporting that we&amp;#39;re seeing a slowdown</text>
  <text start="593.25" dur="7.77">in home prices now remember the central</text>
  <text start="598.11" dur="5.28">banks they pump up the economy in 20</text>
  <text start="601.02" dur="5.01">cities to show that housing prices were</text>
  <text start="603.39" dur="5.87">doing fantastically now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="606.03" dur="4.83">seeing is it can&amp;#39;t be sustained</text>
  <text start="609.26" dur="4.72">especially with the interest rates</text>
  <text start="610.86" dur="5.28">moving up and a lot of those other areas</text>

  <text start="643.71" dur="6.21">a hold on rates think about what Trump</text>
  <text start="647.31" dur="5.31">just did right now when he was out there</text>

  <text start="664.11" dur="5.73">now they&amp;#39;re on the same page because</text>
  <text start="667.2" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re starting to realize that their</text>
  <text start="669.84" dur="5.85">plan to bring down the economy well they</text>
  <text start="674.07" dur="3.39">need to stop it right now because</text>
  <text start="675.69" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re not in control of the narrative</text>
  <text start="677.46" dur="4.92">and they realize whoa when the Fed does</text>
  <text start="680.67" dur="3.6">raise interest rates things start to</text>
  <text start="682.38" dur="4.68">fall apart and if you look a little bit</text>
  <text start="684.27" dur="5.7">deeper why is this because the economy</text>
  <text start="687.06" dur="5.64">is a gigantic illusion they lied about</text>
  <text start="689.97" dur="6.15">all these statistical numbers they lied</text>
  <text start="692.7" dur="5.52">about the economy they lied about what</text>
  <text start="696.12" dur="6.36">the Fed has been doing all this time</text>
  <text start="698.22" dur="7.53">we really don&amp;#39;t know how much the Fed</text>
  <text start="702.48" dur="4.71">has really created I mean we have some</text>
  <text start="705.75" dur="3.93">idea but I&amp;#39;m telling you it&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="707.19" dur="4.71">lot worse than we even think their books</text>
  <text start="709.68" dur="4.83">are closed we have no idea where they</text>
  <text start="711.9" dur="6.36">funneled this money off to this is why</text>
  <text start="714.51" dur="6.48">in the end it&amp;#39;s all about auditing the</text>
  <text start="718.26" dur="4.68">Fed and once you do this and once the</text>
  <text start="720.99" dur="3.5">system comes down and people understand</text>
  <text start="722.94" dur="4.56">and realize what is happening here</text>

  <text start="727.5" dur="5.25">more central banks look what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="728.79" dur="6.66">done they destroyed a global economy and</text>
  <text start="732.75" dur="5.28">guess what who has control of the</text>
  <text start="735.45" dur="5.12">narrative at this point not the central</text>

  <text start="740.57" dur="5.77">they&amp;#39;re out there and they are warning</text>
  <text start="743.19" dur="5.73">that the global trade is slowing down</text>
  <text start="746.34" dur="4.98">and it&amp;#39;s going to slow down even further</text>
