  <text start="65.69" dur="5.58">event let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="68.81" dur="4.8">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="71.27" dur="5.269">now we know a couple weeks o Trump</text>
  <text start="73.61" dur="5.85">tweeted out that Obama was wiretapping</text>
  <text start="76.539" dur="5.021">his office and of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="79.46" dur="4.32">media went completely crazy over this</text>
  <text start="81.56" dur="4.14">and today we feel over the corporate</text>
  <text start="83.78" dur="4.05">media where they&amp;#39;re saying that all they</text>
  <text start="85.7" dur="4.619">have no evidence the White House has no</text>
  <text start="87.83" dur="5.01">evidence the GOP chair says there is no</text>
  <text start="90.319" dur="4.59">evidence but if you listen to what</text>
  <text start="92.84" dur="3.479">they&amp;#39;re actually saying it&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="94.909" dur="3.451">the corporate media is actually</text>
  <text start="96.319" dur="5.521">reporting GOP chair of House</text>
  <text start="98.36" dur="6.48">Intelligence panel Devin Nunez well he</text>
  <text start="101.84" dur="5.01">confirmed what he said last week namely</text>
  <text start="104.84" dur="4.74">that his panel has still not received</text>
  <text start="106.85" dur="6.389">any evidence from the Trump Organization</text>
  <text start="109.58" dur="5.489">on the wiretapping during the election</text>
  <text start="113.239" dur="3.811">campaign doesn&amp;#39;t mean that there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="115.069" dur="4.261">evidence it means he has not received</text>
  <text start="117.05" dur="3.92">yet now we know the White House says</text>
  <text start="119.33" dur="3.87">they need a little bit more time and</text>
  <text start="120.97" dur="3.819">they&amp;#39;re putting the information together</text>
  <text start="123.2" dur="3.6">and of course McCain and all the others</text>
  <text start="124.789" dur="3.48">they want to know what they have because</text>
  <text start="126.8" dur="4.17">they want to know where it&amp;#39;s coming from</text>
  <text start="128.269" dur="4.681">how did he find out who do we have to</text>
  <text start="130.97" dur="4.95">blackmail who do we have to get rid of</text>
  <text start="132.95" dur="4.679">and we see right now that Sean Spicer is</text>
  <text start="135.92" dur="3.51">out there saying that he&amp;#39;s extremely</text>
  <text start="137.629" dur="3.69">confident that the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="4.23">will produce evidence to back up his</text>
  <text start="141.319" dur="4.351">assertion he said Trump believes the</text>
  <text start="143.66" dur="4.23">evidence will vindicate him and once</text>
  <text start="145.67" dur="4.59">again I said this in the past he came</text>
  <text start="147.89" dur="4.59">out saying this now if he produces no</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="4.41">evidence whatsoever he has no paper</text>
  <text start="152.48" dur="5.31">trail absolutely nothing he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="154.67" dur="5.37">be seen as a liar so for him to come out</text>
  <text start="157.79" dur="5.64">and say something like this they must</text>
  <text start="160.04" dur="5.55">have had some type of information and to</text>
  <text start="163.43" dur="3.9">me what it looks like is most likely</text>
  <text start="165.59" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re trying to put this together and</text>
  <text start="167.33" dur="5.04">try to explain it to the American people</text>
  <text start="169.61" dur="4.65">because what we&amp;#39;re hearing from Judge</text>
  <text start="172.37" dur="4.17">Napolitano what we&amp;#39;re hearing from</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="5.129">Edward Snowden what we&amp;#39;re hearing from</text>
  <text start="176.54" dur="5.91">WikiLeaks is that there&amp;#39;s certain ways</text>
  <text start="179.389" dur="4.68">to I&amp;#39;ll use the word wiretap the</text>
  <text start="182.45" dur="3.179">office now today they don&amp;#39;t actually go</text>
  <text start="184.069" dur="3.361">in and they tap the wires it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="185.629" dur="3.72">completely set up it&amp;#39;s already done</text>
  <text start="187.43" dur="5.79">across the country and all the devices</text>
  <text start="189.349" dur="6.481">and we know that the NSA is collecting a</text>
  <text start="193.22" dur="4.349">lot of the information and we know if</text>
  <text start="195.83" dur="4.8">you go outside of the country to the</text>
  <text start="197.569" dur="5.101">other organizations like the British</text>
  <text start="200.63" dur="5.37">intelligence office and others in other</text>
  <text start="202.67" dur="5.879">countries they have access to the NSA</text>
  <text start="206" dur="5.58">database which it is illegal for them to</text>
  <text start="208.549" dur="4.951">take that information because old are</text>
  <text start="211.58" dur="3.03">saying is that hey we didn&amp;#39;t give it to</text>
  <text start="213.5" dur="3.18">the authorities here in the United</text>
  <text start="214.61" dur="3.9">States we gave it to the authority in a</text>
  <text start="216.68" dur="3.57">different country and it doesn&amp;#39;t violate</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="3.33">the people&amp;#39;s rights because we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="220.25" dur="3.75">doing it here in the United States it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.84" dur="5.489">like a workaround type of thing but</text>
  <text start="224" dur="6.45">again just recording and collecting in</text>
  <text start="227.329" dur="5.341">the information is a violation out of</text>
  <text start="230.45" dur="4.2">our rights even if they use it or don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="232.67" dur="3.87">use it because they&amp;#39;re still spying on</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="4.02">us because they&amp;#39;re going to look at it</text>
  <text start="236.54" dur="4.77">when they need it now according to</text>
  <text start="238.67" dur="5.039">Edward Snowden the u.s. spy agencies can</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="5.459">simply flip a switch to watch or listen</text>
  <text start="243.709" dur="5.43">in on anything going on in particular</text>
  <text start="246.769" dur="5.401">room by turning on particular devices</text>
  <text start="249.139" dur="5.491">cameras microphones etc now we know this</text>
  <text start="252.17" dur="5.73">to be true from vult 7 yes the</text>
  <text start="254.63" dur="6.24">technology is real and we know that the</text>
  <text start="257.9" dur="5.34">NSA the NSA the CIA the FBI and all the</text>
  <text start="260.87" dur="3.6">other agencies well they would say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.24" dur="2.91">against the law for us to actually</text>
  <text start="264.47" dur="3.419">listen in and to look at this</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="4.47">information and this is why they had the</text>
  <text start="267.889" dur="5.551">FISA Court because it allows them to go</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="4.44">to the FISA Court have another country</text>
  <text start="273.44" dur="4.89">look up the information and get it and</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="5.579">then transfer it over to the person in</text>
  <text start="278.33" dur="4.64">the United States and this is what Obama</text>
  <text start="280.639" dur="4.351">did now i&amp;#39;m sure the trump</text>
  <text start="282.97" dur="4.84">administration is trying to put this</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="5.88">together and piece it together and most</text>
  <text start="287.81" dur="5.82">likely trying to explain how this is all</text>
  <text start="290.87" dur="5.82">done and who is involved in all this</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="5.37">because when it does come out depending</text>
  <text start="296.69" dur="3.599">on how it comes out people are going to</text>
  <text start="299" dur="3.9">scratch their heads and say wait a</text>
  <text start="300.289" dur="5.281">minute it&amp;#39;s true that everyone is being</text>
  <text start="302.9" dur="5.37">spied on and you are collecting our</text>
  <text start="305.57" dur="5.52">information so we will have to wait and</text>
  <text start="308.27" dur="5.25">see how this whole turns out but we can</text>
  <text start="311.09" dur="3.84">see that those in power who are on the</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="2.67">corporate media the deep state the</text>
  <text start="314.93" dur="2.85">central bank there</text>
  <text start="316.19" dur="2.88">very nervous and they keep saying</text>
  <text start="317.78" dur="2.97">there&amp;#39;s no evidence there&amp;#39;s no evidence</text>
  <text start="319.07" dur="4.68">trying to convince the public there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="5.37">nothing he&amp;#39;s a liar but we can see that</text>
  <text start="323.75" dur="5.46">something is going to come out and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.12" dur="5.76">going to shock the entire world we see</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="4.74">Judicial Watch right now has filed a</text>
  <text start="331.88" dur="3.72">Freedom of Information Act lawsuit</text>
  <text start="333.95" dur="3.57">against the Central Intelligence Agency</text>
  <text start="335.6" dur="4.46">the United States Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="337.52" dur="4.89">and the Department of Treasury regarding</text>
  <text start="340.06" dur="4.51">records related to the investigation of</text>
  <text start="342.41" dur="4.14">retired youíd united states army</text>
  <text start="344.57" dur="3.99">lieutenant general Michael Flynn&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.55" dur="5.22">communication with Russian ambassador</text>
  <text start="348.56" dur="6.18">sergey kiss alack now the National</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="4.98">Security Agency refused to confirm or</text>
  <text start="354.74" dur="4.32">deny the existence of intelligence</text>
  <text start="356.75" dur="6.12">records about communications between</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="7.11">Flynn and the ambassador now they issued</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="6.12">a Freedom of Information request and the</text>
  <text start="366.17" dur="5.49">NSA has done absolutely nothing so they</text>
  <text start="368.99" dur="4.95">filed a lawsuit against the agency which</text>
  <text start="371.66" dur="5.4">failed to respond to their January 25th</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="6.15">2017 Freedom of Information Act request</text>
  <text start="377.06" dur="5.46">now in their complaint they are asking</text>
  <text start="380.09" dur="6.54">the court to order the agency to search</text>
  <text start="382.52" dur="7.47">for all records responsive to the FOI a</text>
  <text start="386.63" dur="5.97">request and demonstrate that the agency</text>
  <text start="389.99" dur="4.62">employed reasonable search methods order</text>
  <text start="392.6" dur="4.29">the agencies to produce by a specific</text>
  <text start="394.61" dur="4.71">date all non-exempt records and Vaughn</text>
  <text start="396.89" dur="4.59">index of all withheld records and</text>
  <text start="399.32" dur="5.22">instruct the agency to cease withholding</text>
  <text start="401.48" dur="5.58">all non-exempt records now we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="404.54" dur="4.62">wait to see how this goes again these</text>
  <text start="407.06" dur="4.8">agencies they don&amp;#39;t want to hand over</text>
  <text start="409.16" dur="4.92">certain information and if they did have</text>
  <text start="411.86" dur="3.96">the information and they did have the</text>
  <text start="414.08" dur="4.29">communications they would have just</text>
  <text start="415.82" dur="3.93">handed it over but what I suspect is</text>
  <text start="418.37" dur="4.14">that these communications show</text>
  <text start="419.75" dur="5.16">absolutely nothing and they know it and</text>
  <text start="422.51" dur="4.77">this is why they&amp;#39;re just sitting on it</text>
  <text start="424.91" dur="4.5">now the Department of Justice came out</text>
  <text start="427.28" dur="5.31">and it&amp;#39;s all over the corporate media</text>
  <text start="429.41" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re charging Russian spies over the</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="6.66">Yahoo hack back in 2014 saying that</text>
  <text start="436.28" dur="6.389">these two FS be intelligent officers</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="6.06">well they broke into yahoo they stole</text>
  <text start="442.669" dur="5.221">about 500 million yahoo user accounts</text>
  <text start="445.31" dur="4.03">this was back in 2014 and he decided to</text>
  <text start="447.89" dur="4.029">indict these</text>
  <text start="449.34" dur="4.47">two individuals now what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="451.919" dur="4.53">at this point is they&amp;#39;re keeping the</text>
  <text start="453.81" dur="5.01">Russians story alive they&amp;#39;re pushing it</text>
  <text start="456.449" dur="3.871">out there trying to tell you that this</text>
  <text start="458.82" dur="3.27">is exactly what they did because they</text>
  <text start="460.32" dur="3.599">have the ability to track it down to</text>
  <text start="462.09" dur="3.21">these two individuals think about it for</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="4.981">a second think about what happened with</text>
  <text start="465.3" dur="6.48">vault 7 where the CIA can compile</text>
  <text start="468.9" dur="5.1">malware compile information to make it</text>
  <text start="471.78" dur="5.699">look like it&amp;#39;s from Russia do you really</text>
  <text start="474" dur="6.24">think a state actor is going to access</text>
  <text start="477.479" dur="5.521">yahoo accounts 500 million of them take</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="5.94">a look at the email accounts and get</text>
  <text start="483" dur="6.9">caught no because the way they work is</text>
  <text start="486.18" dur="5.16">to show nothing and for them to say they</text>
  <text start="489.9" dur="4.11">tracked it down to these two individuals</text>
  <text start="491.34" dur="4.47">now remember these individuals are not</text>
  <text start="494.01" dur="5.01">here in the United States the indictment</text>
  <text start="495.81" dur="5.16">is meaningless because the Russian spies</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="3.09">well since they&amp;#39;re not here in the</text>
  <text start="500.97" dur="4.68">United States and they&amp;#39;re in Russia</text>
  <text start="502.11" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s a huge problem the u.s. does not</text>
  <text start="505.65" dur="4.32">have an extradition treaty with Russia</text>
  <text start="507.51" dur="5.49">so Russia is not going to be handing</text>
  <text start="509.97" dur="5.249">anyone over this whole thing is part of</text>
  <text start="513" dur="4.349">the propaganda because I know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="515.219" dur="5.101">nothing they can do at this point they</text>
  <text start="517.349" dur="6.93">want to keep the Russian propaganda</text>
  <text start="520.32" dur="6.06">alive that Russia is cyber attacking the</text>
  <text start="524.279" dur="4.201">United States which fits into them cyber</text>
  <text start="526.38" dur="4.17">attack in the dnc which fits into them</text>

  <text start="530.55" dur="4.56">Trump being associated with Russia this</text>
  <text start="533.64" dur="4.29">is how they&amp;#39;re trying to fit it in and</text>
  <text start="535.11" dur="6.599">they&amp;#39;re using this right now to convince</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="7.05">everyone that all of this is true why</text>
  <text start="541.709" dur="5.401">the question why do they keep saying all</text>
  <text start="544.98" dur="4.14">of this stuff why do they want it to be</text>
  <text start="547.11" dur="4.86">true we have to go back to what the Fed</text>

  <text start="551.97" dur="3.48">setting up the economy to fail remember</text>
  <text start="553.92" dur="3.24">the whole thing is based on the economy</text>
  <text start="555.45" dur="3.78">because this is what all the countries</text>
  <text start="557.16" dur="4.32">have in common they&amp;#39;re flooded with debt</text>
  <text start="559.23" dur="4.26">which cannot be sustained and they know</text>
  <text start="561.48" dur="3.57">once they start bringing it down they</text>
  <text start="563.49" dur="4.25">don&amp;#39;t want the finger being pointed at</text>

  <text start="843.06" dur="5.37">just stopped all trade with the south</text>

  <text start="849.69" dur="5.25">they stop trade with those individuals</text>
  <text start="852.81" dur="4.8">it looks like poroshenko is getting</text>
  <text start="854.94" dur="5.07">prepared to really go all out in this</text>
  <text start="857.61" dur="5.43">area remember we had Graham we had</text>
  <text start="860.01" dur="5.34">McCain visit Kiev they said this is the</text>

  <text start="870.51" dur="3.75">Russia I don&amp;#39;t really think Russia</text>
  <text start="872.13" dur="5.34">really cares but they&amp;#39;re doing all of</text>
  <text start="874.26" dur="4.86">this to provoke and push something big</text>
  <text start="877.47" dur="3.72">and we can see this is not just</text>
  <text start="879.12" dur="3.87">happening in Kiev it&amp;#39;s happening in many</text>
  <text start="881.19" dur="3.42">different areas now yesterday we</text>
  <text start="882.99" dur="4.47">reported or the day before we reported</text>
  <text start="884.61" dur="4.77">that Russia is bringing in troops into</text>
  <text start="887.46" dur="3.75">Egypt now Russia is out there and</text>
  <text start="889.38" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re saying this is completely untrue</text>
  <text start="891.21" dur="5.64">we have not brought in Special Forces</text>
  <text start="893.67" dur="6.3">into Egypt this is just not being done</text>
  <text start="896.85" dur="5.49">and they&amp;#39;re responding because the u.s.</text>
  <text start="899.97" dur="4.74">is claiming that this was the case and</text>
  <text start="902.34" dur="5.01">there was an Egyptian official claiming</text>
  <text start="904.71" dur="4.5">that 22 Russian troops were at a Western</text>
  <text start="907.35" dur="4.35">air base apparently with an eye on</text>
  <text start="909.21" dur="4.62">aiding Libyan National Army and Russia</text>
  <text start="911.7" dur="5.13">saying no this is not true whatsoever</text>
  <text start="913.83" dur="5.97">now the question we have to ask is why</text>
  <text start="916.83" dur="6.45">was this being put out there well it</text>
  <text start="919.8" dur="6.54">looks like the u.s. might be preparing</text>
  <text start="923.28" dur="4.59">to go into Libya because we can see that</text>
  <text start="926.34" dur="4.38">things are completely getting out of</text>
  <text start="927.87" dur="5.34">hand in Libya and we also see that the</text>
  <text start="930.72" dur="4.92">White House they have given the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="933.21" dur="5.22">commanders additional authority in</text>
  <text start="935.64" dur="6.09">selecting Yemen operations in order to</text>
  <text start="938.43" dur="4.68">achieve a strategic effect and what</text>
  <text start="941.73" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re saying is they won&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="943.11" dur="5.28">president&amp;#39;s approval for each strike now</text>
  <text start="944.94" dur="6.09">this seems a little odd to me because</text>
  <text start="948.39" dur="5.85">what Trump has said and what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="951.03" dur="5.25">are completely two different things it</text>
  <text start="954.24" dur="5.4">seems like he&amp;#39;s getting more and more</text>
  <text start="956.28" dur="5.67">involved in these wars in the Middle</text>
  <text start="959.64" dur="4.05">East following up on what Obama was</text>
  <text start="961.95" dur="5.91">doing but the deep state was doing and</text>
  <text start="963.69" dur="7.62">we can see that we have troops inside of</text>
  <text start="967.86" dur="6.93">Syria of course illegally and we have</text>

  <text start="982.98" dur="2.64">this</text>
  <text start="983.279" dur="5.49">is very interesting where they&amp;#39;re all in</text>
  <text start="985.62" dur="5.069">the Rocket Man beach area now president</text>
  <text start="988.769" dur="3.601">Trump says the purpose of the escalation</text>
  <text start="990.689" dur="5.101">is to defeat the Islamic state in raka</text>
  <text start="992.37" dur="5.639">however the Syrian army with his allies</text>
  <text start="995.79" dur="3.839">Russia and Iran are already close to</text>
  <text start="998.009" dur="5.37">defeating the Islamic state in Syria so</text>
  <text start="999.629" dur="6.45">why must the US military be sent in when</text>

  <text start="1013.459" dur="4.44">occupy the eastern Syria area is this</text>
  <text start="1016.399" dur="3.391">what they want to do they want to split</text>
  <text start="1017.899" dur="3.901">up Syria are they still going to be</text>
  <text start="1019.79" dur="4.289">going after Assad because what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1021.8" dur="4.649">the agenda here because the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1024.079" dur="4.951">state is completely done with right now</text>
  <text start="1026.449" dur="4.831">now if Trump is planning on handing</text>
  <text start="1029.03" dur="4.95">eastern Syria over to the Kurds well</text>
  <text start="1031.28" dur="4.139">this is completely illegal what gives</text>
  <text start="1033.98" dur="3.689">the United States the rights to do this</text>
  <text start="1035.419" dur="4.92">inside of Syria they have no rights to</text>

  <text start="1040.339" dur="5.07">after Assad well we see we&amp;#39;re on the</text>
