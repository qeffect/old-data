  <text start="245.98" dur="7.789">a very long time was to have a one-world</text>
  <text start="248.919" dur="8.28">currency do you have full control over</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="9.611">everything this was actually discussed</text>
  <text start="257.199" dur="11.28">at the g7 they discussed having a war a</text>

  <text start="286.21" dur="6.179">the TPP it failed but what we see</text>
  <text start="290.169" dur="5.671">happening here is that as Trump</text>
  <text start="292.389" dur="7.201">continually turns the screws the deep</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="8.009">state the central bankers they becoming</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="8.36">desperate they&amp;#39;re scared they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="307.95" dur="11.14">become afraid what happens they start to</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="6.72">reveal their true plan this is what</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing with the deep state</text>
  <text start="321.4" dur="7.319">think about when Trump brought up the</text>
  <text start="324.4" dur="6.509">border they fought against it and they</text>
  <text start="328.719" dur="4.26">showed their true colors and what they</text>
  <text start="330.909" dur="4.351">were really trying to do they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="332.979" dur="5.581">care about the gangs coming in human</text>
  <text start="335.26" dur="6.51">traffickers it&amp;#39;s the same thing with the</text>
  <text start="338.56" dur="6">central bankers they&amp;#39;re being exposed</text>
  <text start="341.77" dur="6.09">they realized what Trump is doing and</text>
  <text start="344.56" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop it what do they</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="4.65">do to stop it</text>
  <text start="348.7" dur="6.06">they reveal their true plans it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="352.51" dur="6.149">longer a secret it&amp;#39;s no longer a</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="7.76">conspiracy and that is exactly what</text>
  <text start="358.659" dur="8.931">they&amp;#39;re doing right now Trump right now</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="8.59">he is removing the old economic system</text>
  <text start="367.59" dur="7.629">getting rid of it and a new economic</text>
  <text start="371.11" dur="6.059">economic system is being born and we can</text>
  <text start="375.219" dur="5.431">see that this is happening not just here</text>
  <text start="377.169" dur="5.25">in the US but around the world and I</text>
  <text start="380.65" dur="3.69">believe there&amp;#39;s a lot more people</text>
  <text start="382.419" dur="4.05">following him and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="384.34" dur="4.35">leaders then we actually know about</text>
  <text start="386.469" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re not coming out and saying it</text>
  <text start="388.69" dur="8.159">right out to the public eventually they</text>
  <text start="392.409" dur="7.081">will but Boris Johnson he is fighting a</text>
  <text start="396.849" dur="4.981">good fight now it&amp;#39;s very interesting it</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="4.32">seems that the deep state the mainstream</text>
  <text start="401.83" dur="4.079">media they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing to</text>
  <text start="403.81" dur="6.329">Boris Johnson as they&amp;#39;ve been doing to</text>
  <text start="405.909" dur="10.251">Trump the report has come out that Boris</text>
  <text start="410.139" dur="9.231">Johnson lied to queen elizabeth ii about</text>
  <text start="416.16" dur="6.99">suspending Parliament now Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="419.37" dur="8.55">is saying this is absolutely fake phony</text>
  <text start="423.15" dur="6.57">and false I did not lied to her and what</text>
  <text start="427.92" dur="6.41">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="429.72" dur="7.16">to show that he lied to get his way</text>
  <text start="434.33" dur="7.54">isn&amp;#39;t this what they do with Trump</text>
  <text start="436.88" dur="7.9">remember it&amp;#39;s the same players now the</text>
  <text start="441.87" dur="6.3">highest civil court in Scotland ruled</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="5.79">that this advice and the suspension were</text>
  <text start="448.17" dur="5.46">unlawful because it was clearly designed</text>
  <text start="450.57" dur="6.03">to stymie parliamentary scrutiny of the</text>
  <text start="453.63" dur="4.86">government the court ruled that the true</text>
  <text start="456.6" dur="5.37">motive for suspending Parliament was not</text>
  <text start="458.49" dur="6.63">as Johnson told the Queen Johnson said</text>
  <text start="461.97" dur="5.61">that is not true the Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="465.12" dur="5.04">noted that a parallel court case was</text>
  <text start="467.58" dur="5.46">rejected by England&amp;#39;s High Court this</text>
  <text start="470.16" dur="7.89">and the Scottish case will be heard in</text>
  <text start="473.04" dur="8.09">the UK Supreme Court this week and we</text>
  <text start="478.05" dur="7.68">can see that they&amp;#39;re trying everything</text>
  <text start="481.13" dur="7.6">to shut him down because they know he</text>
  <text start="485.73" dur="6.33">will succeed now Trump is continually</text>
  <text start="488.73" dur="5.97">pointing the finger at the Fed that we</text>
  <text start="492.06" dur="5.4">need stimulus we need to cut rates why</text>
  <text start="494.7" dur="6.3">do we need this when Trump brings the</text>
  <text start="497.46" dur="6.35">interest rate to zero or negative well</text>
  <text start="501" dur="6.72">there&amp;#39;s no interest on the national debt</text>
  <text start="503.81" dur="8.53">the payments go way down we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="7.71">as many tax receipts to pay the debt we</text>
  <text start="512.34" dur="5.639">can shift them to other places if it</text>
  <text start="515.43" dur="3.049">goes to negative guess what that&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="4.671">better</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="7.031">it also makes the Fed obsolete because</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="7.6">they&amp;#39;re not lowing loaning currency with</text>
  <text start="525.51" dur="7.95">interest attached Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="530.25" dur="5.43">everything he possibly can to get the</text>
  <text start="533.46" dur="4.83">Fed on board now remember this is part</text>
  <text start="535.68" dur="4.77">of the show because the Fed has to look</text>
  <text start="538.29" dur="4.86">independent Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="540.45" dur="5.13">following European Central Bank acting</text>
  <text start="543.15" dur="5.129">quickly cut rates 10 basis points they</text>
  <text start="545.58" dur="5.05">are trying and succeeding</text>
  <text start="548.279" dur="5.05">depreciating the Euro against the very</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="5.97">strong dollar hurting US exports and the</text>
  <text start="553.329" dur="5.13">Fed sits and sits and sits they get paid</text>
  <text start="556.6" dur="6.45">to borrow money while we are paying</text>
  <text start="558.459" dur="7.111">interest and he&amp;#39;s telling the Fed you</text>
  <text start="563.05" dur="6.3">need to do something and I do believe</text>
  <text start="565.57" dur="5.73">the Fed they are going to make a move we</text>
  <text start="569.35" dur="4.34">already know they started to buy bonds</text>

  <text start="590.17" dur="5.729">the people out there they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="592.839" dur="4.981">realize what is going on and gold is</text>

  <text start="626.76" dur="7.09">it&amp;#39;s going to continually move higher</text>
  <text start="628.87" dur="8.85">and higher and higher now Trump he has</text>
  <text start="633.85" dur="7.429">decided to delay the China tariffs until</text>

  <text start="734.57" dur="7.42">redirecting their investments and their</text>
  <text start="739.529" dur="5.581">destination is long no longer China and</text>
  <text start="741.99" dur="5.06">they&amp;#39;re investing in other countries or</text>
  <text start="745.11" dur="7.14">back here into the United States</text>
  <text start="747.05" dur="8.349">now Beijing said listen we will go ahead</text>
  <text start="752.25" dur="7.5">and start to purchase agricultural</text>
  <text start="755.399" dur="7.44">products from the United States now as</text>
  <text start="759.75" dur="5.16">we can see they&amp;#39;re both trying to work</text>
  <text start="762.839" dur="5.431">out this deal and it&amp;#39;s a give-and-take</text>
  <text start="764.91" dur="6.21">type of thing so Beijing is considering</text>
  <text start="768.27" dur="5.04">whether term it to permit imports of</text>
  <text start="771.12" dur="5.7">American agricultural products including</text>
  <text start="773.31" dur="6.899">soybeans and pork and this would again</text>
  <text start="776.82" dur="6.3">alleviate the trade tensions and I think</text>
  <text start="780.209" dur="6.241">Trump is with he will be making headway</text>
  <text start="783.12" dur="5.279">and he will be making a deal Trump</text>
  <text start="786.45" dur="3.78">tweeted out the following it is expected</text>
  <text start="788.399" dur="4.141">that China will be buying large amounts</text>
  <text start="790.23" dur="5.7">of our agricultural products we also</text>
  <text start="792.54" dur="6">have Taiwan they have announced plans to</text>
  <text start="795.93" dur="4.05">buy 3.6 billion worth of American</text>
  <text start="798.54" dur="5.46">foreign products including soy beans</text>
  <text start="799.98" dur="8.19">corn wheat and meat products and this</text>
  <text start="804" dur="7.23">follows Beijing saying okay we will also</text>
  <text start="808.17" dur="7.79">purchase so Trump is making deals with</text>
  <text start="811.23" dur="9.109">many countries bypassing the globalists</text>
  <text start="815.96" dur="8.25">creating his own system why is he doing</text>
  <text start="820.339" dur="6.721">this he has to for the United States to</text>
  <text start="824.21" dur="6.06">be independent for the United States to</text>
  <text start="827.06" dur="6.63">drop the reserve currency what does</text>
  <text start="830.27" dur="6.6">Trump have to do well he needs to set up</text>
  <text start="833.69" dur="5.36">trade deals because countries who kept</text>
  <text start="836.87" dur="5.909">dollars in the reserves to pay for oil</text>
  <text start="839.05" dur="6.55">or to pay for other products they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="842.779" dur="4.591">have the dollar in the reserves if the</text>
  <text start="845.6" dur="3.179">United States is no longer the duck I</text>
  <text start="847.37" dur="4.32">should say the Federal Reserve Note is</text>
  <text start="848.779" dur="3.781">no longer the reserve currency so then</text>
  <text start="851.69" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re gonna be using their own</text>
  <text start="852.56" dur="5.79">currency to purchase good so Trump needs</text>
  <text start="855.23" dur="5.94">to set up trade deals that have nothing</text>
  <text start="858.35" dur="6.45">to do with the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="861.17" dur="6.27">what else does Trump have to do well he</text>
  <text start="864.8" dur="4.65">also has to make sure that we&amp;#39;re energy</text>
  <text start="867.44" dur="5.36">independent and I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="869.45" dur="6.27">the Green Deal and talking about oil</text>
  <text start="872.8" dur="5.56">because once we are no longer the</text>
  <text start="875.72" dur="8">reserve currency once we come off of the</text>
  <text start="878.36" dur="8.94">petro dollar the oil in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="883.72" dur="7.84">will no longer be purchased using the</text>
  <text start="887.3" dur="8.58">Federal Reserve Note which means we need</text>
  <text start="891.56" dur="8.07">to produce oil to sell it to other</text>
  <text start="895.88" dur="6.51">countries and to have it for the United</text>
  <text start="899.63" dur="6.02">States and what we&amp;#39;ve just found out is</text>
  <text start="902.39" dur="7.28">that the US has surpassed Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="905.65" dur="10.09">Russia to become the world&amp;#39;s top oil</text>
  <text start="909.67" dur="9.37">exporter and how did this happen this is</text>
  <text start="915.74" dur="5.55">from record shale production the u.s.</text>
  <text start="919.04" dur="5.28">shipped nearly nine million barrels of</text>
  <text start="921.29" dur="5.82">crude and other oil products a day in</text>
  <text start="924.32" dur="7.41">June surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia</text>
  <text start="927.11" dur="8.01">and the US had to do this and since 2010</text>
  <text start="931.73" dur="6.299">moving forward oil production here in</text>
  <text start="935.12" dur="5.76">the United States has been booming and</text>
  <text start="938.029" dur="7.261">when we look at 2016 going all over the</text>
  <text start="940.88" dur="8.58">2018-2019 we hit that mark where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="945.29" dur="7.92">with other countries which means</text>
  <text start="949.46" dur="7.8">the transition is getting closer and</text>
  <text start="953.21" dur="7.47">closer which means that as Trump</text>
  <text start="957.26" dur="6.45">continually creates these free trade</text>
  <text start="960.68" dur="7.26">deals as the u.s. becomes energy</text>
  <text start="963.71" dur="7.56">independent Trump and the Patriots will</text>
  <text start="967.94" dur="5.94">have the ability to remove the central</text>
  <text start="971.27" dur="6.09">bank to remove the Federal Reserve Note</text>
  <text start="973.88" dur="6.3">and bring us off of the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="977.36" dur="8.4">system and bring us to a sound money</text>
  <text start="980.18" dur="7.56">system this whole project wasn&amp;#39;t as</text>
  <text start="985.76" dur="4.05">simple as just saying okay let&amp;#39;s go back</text>
  <text start="987.74" dur="4.65">to the gold center there are many</text>
  <text start="989.81" dur="6.06">different things that had to be done in</text>
  <text start="992.39" dur="6.66">advance and this is what Trump has been</text>
  <text start="995.87" dur="6.24">working on we need to sell products we</text>
  <text start="999.05" dur="4.94">need to export we need manufacturing we</text>
  <text start="1002.11" dur="5.43">need companies here in the United States</text>
  <text start="1003.99" dur="6.099">we need to be energy independent we need</text>
  <text start="1007.54" dur="4.83">to have trade deals with other countries</text>
  <text start="1010.089" dur="4.831">because they will not be using the</text>
  <text start="1012.37" dur="5.07">Federal Reserve Note to purchase our</text>
  <text start="1014.92" dur="4.2">products here we&amp;#39;re going to have we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1017.44" dur="4.11">going to have to have some type of trade</text>
  <text start="1019.12" dur="5.969">with these countries and this is why</text>
  <text start="1021.55" dur="5.25">Trump has been doing this in the three</text>
  <text start="1025.089" dur="3.421">years that he&amp;#39;s been in office</text>
  <text start="1026.8" dur="4.649">remember the deep state essential</text>
  <text start="1028.51" dur="5.22">bankers had many many years to shift</text>
  <text start="1031.449" dur="5.13">everything he&amp;#39;s shifting everything back</text>
  <text start="1033.73" dur="4.709">in a very short period of time and he</text>
  <text start="1036.579" dur="5.911">has a lot more to go but we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1038.439" dur="6.63">closer and closer and as you can see the</text>
