  <text start="130.23" dur="5.74">we had many Democrats vote for this</text>
  <text start="135.19" dur="4.89">impeachment</text>
  <text start="135.97" dur="8.67">remember there&amp;#39;s many ways to drain a</text>

  <text start="144.64" dur="7.58">show that it wasn&amp;#39;t Trump it was in his</text>
  <text start="149.41" dur="7.04">administration it was all these</text>
  <text start="152.22" dur="7.27">individuals this is about exposing them</text>
  <text start="156.45" dur="6.18">draining the swamp and one way to drain</text>
  <text start="159.49" dur="7.16">a swamp like this is to have the people</text>

  <text start="189.84" dur="5.64">working in their best interest and I do</text>
  <text start="193.05" dur="5.52">believe that Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="195.48" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;ve accomplished this because as we</text>
  <text start="198.57" dur="5.49">know when this moves from the house and</text>
  <text start="201.66" dur="4.8">we know that Pelosi she&amp;#39;s trying to keep</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="3.99">this from entering the house she doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="206.46" dur="4.17">want to deliver the articles of</text>
  <text start="208.05" dur="4.95">impeachment doesn&amp;#39;t matter if she does</text>

  <text start="213" dur="6">discuss that in a little bit but we know</text>
  <text start="215.91" dur="6.84">when it gets there everything is going</text>
  <text start="219" dur="7.71">to change everything is going to be</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="7.26">turned around all eyes all fingers will</text>
  <text start="226.71" dur="8.07">be pointing at them at their crimes</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="8.07">at their treasonous acts at their crimes</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="5.4">against humanity this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="238.08" dur="4.32">been trying to cover up this is what</text>
  <text start="240.18" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to hide we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="5.31">talking about that in a little bit but</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="5.46">first it looks like mark meadows has had</text>
  <text start="247.71" dur="6.36">enough he decided that he will retire</text>
  <text start="250.86" dur="6.18">from Congress at the end of his term now</text>
  <text start="254.07" dur="4.88">he&amp;#39;s a four-term congressman and he</text>
  <text start="257.04" dur="6.3">represents the Western North Carolina</text>
  <text start="258.95" dur="8.86">area and he struggled with leaving and</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="5.76">he said it&amp;#39;s time for me to go and I</text>
  <text start="267.81" dur="3.06">think there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot more</text>
  <text start="269.1" dur="5.25">people that are saying you know</text>
  <text start="270.87" dur="6.09">something it&amp;#39;s time and I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.35" dur="4.95">going to be a lot of people that who are</text>
  <text start="276.96" dur="5.25">corrupt who are trying to hang on right</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="6.93">now they&amp;#39;re going to be resigning or</text>
  <text start="282.21" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re gonna be exposed for corruption</text>
  <text start="286.23" dur="4.27">and they will be heading down a</text>
  <text start="288.36" dur="8.05">completely different path</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="10.29">and Trump has been retweeting many Q</text>
  <text start="296.41" dur="7.35">followers and incarcerated et was</text>
  <text start="300.79" dur="6.39">retweeted and this tweet kind of sums up</text>
  <text start="303.76" dur="6.36">the impeachment where we are today where</text>
  <text start="307.18" dur="5.46">it is headed and what won&amp;#39;t happen let</text>
  <text start="310.12" dur="6.12">me read the tweet Trump has not been</text>
  <text start="312.64" dur="7.29">impeached the house can&amp;#39;t impeach they</text>
  <text start="316.24" dur="7.29">can only vote for impeachment then the</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="6.36">Senate trial or Supreme Court trial both</text>
  <text start="323.53" dur="5.82">have to vote to impeach Trump before he</text>
  <text start="326.29" dur="7.62">is actually removed from office which</text>
  <text start="329.35" dur="6.69">will not happen and of course it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="333.91" dur="5.22">going to happen because there is no</text>
  <text start="336.04" dur="5.73">crime the Supreme Court is going to look</text>
  <text start="339.13" dur="5.91">at this the Senate is going to look at</text>
  <text start="341.77" dur="6.99">this and there is no crime to charge</text>
  <text start="345.04" dur="8.07">Trump with and this is where everything</text>
  <text start="348.76" dur="6.27">is going to turn around now Pelosi is</text>
  <text start="353.11" dur="5.28">threatening to withhold the articles of</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="5.82">impeachment from the US Senate and she</text>
  <text start="358.39" dur="4.86">doesn&amp;#39;t care what Republicans say she</text>
  <text start="360.85" dur="5.85">doesn&amp;#39;t care she&amp;#39;s trying to tell the</text>
  <text start="363.25" dur="6.3">Senate what to do no she&amp;#39;s the Speaker</text>
  <text start="366.7" dur="5.73">of the House you now lose your control</text>
  <text start="369.55" dur="5.07">as it moves to the Senate and this is</text>
  <text start="372.43" dur="3.6">what they&amp;#39;re afraid of remember they had</text>
  <text start="374.62" dur="4.83">the control in the house they could</text>
  <text start="376.03" dur="7.71">change the law they can change the rules</text>
  <text start="379.45" dur="6.21">to fit their agenda and actually that</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="4.41">exposed them to the rest of the country</text>
  <text start="385.66" dur="5.91">the rest of the country saw that Trump</text>
  <text start="388.15" dur="7.62">had no chance to fight for himself</text>
  <text start="391.57" dur="7.64">there was no due process now they lose</text>
  <text start="395.77" dur="6.86">control this is what they&amp;#39;re afraid of</text>
  <text start="399.21" dur="7.6">this is where it gets sticky for them</text>
  <text start="402.63" dur="7.06">this is where it actually falls apart so</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="6.39">think about this for a second the deep</text>
  <text start="409.69" dur="6.47">State the Dems impeach the president for</text>
  <text start="413.2" dur="5.55">obstructing the deep state the dams</text>
  <text start="416.16" dur="5.259">obstructed the Republicans and the</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="5.49">president from following rules from due</text>
  <text start="421.419" dur="4.831">process and Pelosi is now obstruct</text>
  <text start="424.24" dur="4.38">the impeachment they just had by</text>
  <text start="426.25" dur="5.099">refusing to hand over the articles of</text>
  <text start="428.62" dur="6.72">impeachment so who&amp;#39;s really obstructing</text>
  <text start="431.349" dur="6.931">I believe it&amp;#39;s them Paul Sperry tweeted</text>
  <text start="435.34" dur="5.699">out the falling Pelosi earlier today</text>
  <text start="438.28" dur="3.75">warned Trump an ongoing threat to our</text>

  <text start="450.88" dur="5.58">sending articles to Senate for removal</text>
  <text start="453.22" dur="6">why delay one minute I agree</text>
  <text start="456.46" dur="4.199">why would she delay because she&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="3.78">to delay the whole thing do they want</text>
  <text start="460.659" dur="5.211">the impeachment to sit they can use this</text>
  <text start="463" dur="8.52">as a block what do they think is coming</text>

  <text start="505.719" dur="3.871">in American history</text>
  <text start="507.07" dur="5.04">now the do-nothing Party want to do</text>
