  <text start="127.32" dur="6.12">purpose remember look at the gold price</text>

  <text start="201.06" dur="9.39">ramp up in China very interestingly we</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="7.56">see that the people of China they are</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="8.16">selling their stocks getting rid of</text>
  <text start="214.29" dur="7.82">their fiat currency which is the central</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="7.67">bank currency which is a debt note and</text>
  <text start="222.11" dur="6.94">they&amp;#39;re using it to purchase gold</text>
  <text start="226.28" dur="5.5">they&amp;#39;re even taking their money out of</text>
  <text start="229.05" dur="5.55">the bank why because they want to</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="5.84">protect their assets you think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="234.6" dur="6.3">starting to realize what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="237.62" dur="5.41">many countries many people out there are</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="4.35">realizing what&amp;#39;s happening here in the</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="5.85">United States the mass majority they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="5.91">sleeping they&amp;#39;re not purchasing precious</text>
  <text start="248.88" dur="5.64">metals silver gold protecting their</text>
  <text start="251.16" dur="7.5">wealth they still believe in the Federal</text>
  <text start="254.52" dur="6">Reserve Note but soon this is going to</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="2.52">change and I&amp;#39;ve been saying this for a</text>
  <text start="260.52" dur="3.09">very long time</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="5.04">you need you need to be prepared the</text>
  <text start="263.61" dur="4.59">difference now compared to when Obama</text>
  <text start="266.22" dur="5.25">was president and thank God Clinton is</text>
  <text start="268.2" dur="6.51">not is that we&amp;#39;re heading towards this</text>
  <text start="271.47" dur="6.06">soft transition is going to be perfectly</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="4.02">smooth where nobody gets hurt no people</text>
  <text start="277.53" dur="5.96">are going to still get hurt you just</text>
  <text start="278.73" dur="8.189">can&amp;#39;t move from a complete debt system</text>
  <text start="283.49" dur="5.59">into a sound money system and just have</text>
  <text start="286.919" dur="3.631">people say hey everything&amp;#39;s perfect</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="3.27">everything that I had in the bank</text>
  <text start="290.55" dur="4.58">everything that I had before just</text>
  <text start="292.35" dur="4.719">transfer it right over no because that</text>
  <text start="295.13" dur="4.939">currency</text>
  <text start="297.069" dur="6.24">is continually losing value over time</text>
  <text start="300.069" dur="6.24">remember prior to 1971 we came from a</text>
  <text start="303.309" dur="5.871">sound money system and moved on to the</text>
  <text start="306.309" dur="6.121">petrodollar so your dollars at that time</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="8.199">were backed by gold let&amp;#39;s just say that</text>
  <text start="312.43" dur="7.289">and it had some value and then right</text>
  <text start="317.379" dur="4.47">after that it started to lose value</text>
  <text start="319.719" dur="5.6">now we&amp;#39;re going from something that has</text>
  <text start="321.849" dur="8.25">lost a lot of value into a new currency</text>
  <text start="325.319" dur="7">that will have value and this is going</text>
  <text start="330.099" dur="4.5">to be a problem for many people and this</text>
  <text start="332.319" dur="4.68">is why for a very long time we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="334.599" dur="4.47">saying we all should be prepared not</text>
  <text start="336.999" dur="3.961">just with gold and silver but with food</text>
  <text start="339.069" dur="4.53">and and and supplies and things like</text>
  <text start="340.96" dur="4.169">that because we are going to be going</text>
  <text start="343.599" dur="4.53">through this transition and it will be</text>
  <text start="345.129" dur="6.44">bumpy but Trump is pushing the agenda</text>
  <text start="348.129" dur="8.94">the Patriots are pushing their agenda to</text>
  <text start="351.569" dur="9.57">complete the new economic system and for</text>
  <text start="357.069" dur="8.551">the first time ever the United States</text>
  <text start="361.139" dur="7.51">has sent rice to China now think about</text>
  <text start="365.62" dur="6.089">that for a second the United States is</text>
  <text start="368.649" dur="7.91">sending rice to China China grows rice</text>
  <text start="371.709" dur="9.6">they have fields and fields of rice and</text>
  <text start="376.559" dur="7.84">Sun Valley rice an American company it</text>
  <text start="381.309" dur="6.48">secured a Chinese contract the Chinese</text>
  <text start="384.399" dur="5.85">importer bought two containers of medium</text>
  <text start="387.789" dur="7.61">grain rice from the American company</text>
  <text start="390.249" dur="9.361">while the trade deal is being hashed out</text>
  <text start="395.399" dur="10.69">now this company they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="399.61" dur="9.63">do this since 2004 the CEO of Sun Valley</text>
  <text start="406.089" dur="6.75">Rice said 15 years of patience and hard</text>
  <text start="409.24" dur="6.75">work have paid off it is truly an honor</text>
  <text start="412.839" dur="6.38">and a privilege to blaze this trail of</text>
  <text start="415.99" dur="5.819">trading history American rice in China</text>
  <text start="419.219" dur="5.2">our team has worked with incredible</text>
  <text start="421.809" dur="6.15">tenacity and diligence to reach this</text>
  <text start="424.419" dur="5.1">point the rice deal follows the sale of</text>
  <text start="427.959" dur="2.431">five hundred and forty four thousand</text>
  <text start="429.519" dur="4.291">tons</text>
  <text start="430.39" dur="5.07">American soybeans to China so I guess</text>
  <text start="433.81" dur="5.01">this is what Trump was talking about</text>
  <text start="435.46" dur="6.15">where China was going to purchase some</text>
  <text start="438.82" dur="4.85">of our agricultural products it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="441.61" dur="6.48">just soybeans anymore</text>
  <text start="443.67" dur="7.48">again the entire economic plan is moving</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="6.12">forward what does Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="451.15" dur="4.68">have to do they need to set up all of</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="4.47">these trade deals this is part of the</text>
  <text start="455.83" dur="5.9">new economic system and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="458.68" dur="7.95">hearing and this is excellent news that</text>
  <text start="461.73" dur="11.32">Peter Navarro has reengaged with China</text>
  <text start="466.63" dur="8.81">on the trade talks now where is the</text>
  <text start="473.05" dur="5.73">starting point for these trade talks</text>
  <text start="475.44" dur="5.53">well the prior 150-page agreement</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="5.67">negotiated by Robert light hyzer and</text>
  <text start="480.97" dur="5.76">Vice Premier Li he previously dismissed</text>
  <text start="484.45" dur="5.76">by Beijing after three months of intense</text>
  <text start="486.73" dur="6.42">discussion is now the starting point for</text>
  <text start="490.21" dur="6.15">the new talks this means the Chinese</text>
  <text start="493.15" dur="6.39">have acquiesced to the prior terms they</text>
  <text start="496.36" dur="5.04">rebuked the seven chapters each assigned</text>
  <text start="499.54" dur="4.65">to a specific trade sector are the</text>
  <text start="501.4" dur="5.01">baseline for light hyzer and lihi to</text>
  <text start="504.19" dur="6.24">reengage excellent news from the</text>
  <text start="506.41" dur="9.45">position of the US team and we can see</text>
  <text start="510.43" dur="9.45">that China has never negotiated nor</text>
  <text start="515.86" dur="7.7">accepted a less loss before this is the</text>
  <text start="519.88" dur="5.57">first time they&amp;#39;re doing this and again</text>
  <text start="523.56" dur="6.97">strategically Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="525.45" dur="8.77">position themselves to have China bow to</text>
  <text start="530.53" dur="6.24">their demands now lost in all the</text>
  <text start="534.22" dur="5.85">discussions by the Western media as the</text>
  <text start="536.77" dur="4.71">fact that no one has ever attempted to</text>
  <text start="540.07" dur="3.69">structure a comprehensive and</text>
  <text start="541.48" dur="5.22">enforceable trade agreement with China</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="5.99">before what the US team is attempting</text>
  <text start="546.7" dur="6.8">will be the roadmap for all other</text>
  <text start="549.75" dur="9.39">nations and they will write similar</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="8.44">agreements the trade plan with China</text>
  <text start="559.14" dur="5.32">will be completed now right now the</text>
  <text start="561.94" dur="5.04">tariffs will stay in</text>
  <text start="564.46" dur="6.21">and I do believe that the tariffs will</text>
  <text start="566.98" dur="7.08">stay in place even when the trade deal</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="6.57">is finalized because they will make sure</text>
  <text start="574.06" dur="5.52">that China is following through and I do</text>
  <text start="577.24" dur="4.92">believe once China follows through they</text>
  <text start="579.58" dur="6.15">will start to remove portions of the</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="8.31">tariffs this is playing out just like we</text>
  <text start="585.73" dur="8.07">said which means that Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="590.47" dur="6.17">they are completing the new economic</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="5.55">system that&amp;#39;s what this is all about</text>
  <text start="596.64" dur="4.27">removing everything the deep state the</text>
  <text start="599.35" dur="6.63">central bankers have done in the past</text>
  <text start="600.91" dur="6.72">and rebooting the American economy now</text>
  <text start="605.98" dur="3.69">when I say rebooting the air the</text>
  <text start="607.63" dur="4.649">American economy it doesn&amp;#39;t mean taking</text>
  <text start="609.67" dur="4.74">the central bank economy and just saying</text>
  <text start="612.279" dur="4.411">okay now we can move forward it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="6">removing the central bank economy and</text>
  <text start="616.69" dur="7.38">bringing in this new economic system and</text>
  <text start="620.41" dur="8.369">it will not be based on a central bank</text>
  <text start="624.07" dur="8.07">debt note with interest attached this</text>
  <text start="628.779" dur="5.341">system will now benefit the people of</text>
  <text start="632.14" dur="4.26">the United States look what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="634.12" dur="5.73">in the Federal Reserve right now Trump</text>
  <text start="636.4" dur="6.12">is nominating the same type of people</text>
  <text start="639.85" dur="5.28">every single time now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="642.52" dur="6.42">going to try to block this at every turn</text>
  <text start="645.13" dur="5.85">but eventually Trump the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="648.94" dur="4.71">will get their way and these people or</text>
  <text start="650.98" dur="6.06">many or maybe others will be in position</text>
  <text start="653.65" dur="5.73">in the Federal Reserve which will allow</text>
  <text start="657.04" dur="4.86">them to restructure the entire system</text>
  <text start="659.38" dur="5.49">and once there&amp;#39;s a sound money</text>

  <text start="664.87" dur="6.89">place or maybe one or two or three in</text>
  <text start="668.05" dur="7.02">place the restructuring will begin</text>
  <text start="671.76" dur="6.34">remember Q has told us that gold is</text>
