  <text start="100.79" dur="6.72">economy look good and they have been</text>
  <text start="104.479" dur="5.401">throwing manipulated numbers at us for a</text>
  <text start="107.51" dur="4.56">very long time trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="109.88" dur="3.66">that everything is fine and we are</text>
  <text start="112.07" dur="3.479">seeing that case shiller came out</text>
  <text start="113.54" dur="5.13">yesterday talking about how the prices</text>
  <text start="115.549" dur="4.981">on housing is continually rising and of</text>
  <text start="118.67" dur="4.129">course this month this data that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120.53" dur="5.339">providing is from two months ago and</text>
  <text start="122.799" dur="6.19">we&amp;#39;ve seen going forward that the data</text>
  <text start="125.869" dur="4.56">is not showing that housing is going</text>
  <text start="128.989" dur="3.361">well actually a lot of the data that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.429" dur="4.56">coming out is showing us that the</text>
  <text start="132.35" dur="5.28">economy is headed towards a major</text>
  <text start="134.989" dur="4.171">collapse in the system and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="137.63" dur="4.98">going through this collapse for quite a</text>
  <text start="139.16" dur="6.51">while and we see now that the new home</text>
  <text start="142.61" dur="6.27">sales basically disappointed existing</text>
  <text start="145.67" dur="5.49">home sales crashed in November and now</text>
  <text start="148.88" dur="4.97">we&amp;#39;re seeing pending home sales they</text>
  <text start="151.16" dur="4.77">have plunged by point nine percent and</text>
  <text start="153.85" dur="4.9">they thought they were going to have a</text>
  <text start="155.93" dur="4.92">rise of about point seven percent and it</text>
  <text start="158.75" dur="3.78">actually went the opposite way now of</text>
  <text start="160.85" dur="3.69">course makes this whole entire thing</text>
  <text start="162.53" dur="3.569">makes no sense because</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="3.21">schiller on the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="166.099" dur="3.45">telling us you know that everything is</text>
  <text start="167.75" dur="4.23">fine housing prices are continually</text>
  <text start="169.549" dur="4.56">going up but there&amp;#39;s no one purchasing</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="4.789">the homes which makes no sense</text>
  <text start="174.109" dur="5.311">whatsoever and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="176.769" dur="4.601">realtors are now saying people are</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="5.459">getting nervous because of what the Fed</text>
  <text start="181.37" dur="6.509">has done and people now are not going</text>
  <text start="184.879" dur="4.291">out and looking to purchase a home and</text>
  <text start="187.879" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;re finding that a lot of people</text>
  <text start="189.17" dur="3.81">saying okay that just kick me out I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="191.87" dur="3.239">going to wait a little bit to see what</text>
  <text start="192.98" dur="4.86">happens I&amp;#39;m not rushing into it and</text>
  <text start="195.109" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re saying that this is affecting</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="6.06">the real estate market now does it</text>
  <text start="201.409" dur="4.14">really have an effect right now or is it</text>
  <text start="203.9" dur="4.589">that a lot of people are being laid off</text>
  <text start="205.549" dur="5.131">I know that a lot of people with family</text>
  <text start="208.489" dur="5.851">this week&amp;#39;s I am with family this week</text>
  <text start="210.68" dur="7.19">and the stories that I&amp;#39;m hearing where</text>
  <text start="214.34" dur="7.319">people are being laid off from Sony from</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="5.41">accounting services they&amp;#39;re all being</text>
  <text start="221.659" dur="3.591">laid off and they&amp;#39;re getting very</text>
  <text start="223.28" dur="4.829">nervous or they hear rumblings of</text>
  <text start="225.25" dur="5.829">layoffs in the companies and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.109" dur="6.87">getting very nervous and we can see as</text>
  <text start="231.079" dur="7.011">we move into 2016 that the economy is</text>
  <text start="234.979" dur="6.811">going to continually head downward and</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="6.22">we&amp;#39;re getting indications that this is</text>
  <text start="241.79" dur="7.47">where we are headed now we have to</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="7.59">remember this entire system is inflated</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="4.199">into one gigantic bubbles yes there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.9" dur="3.479">multiple bubbles like the student loan</text>
  <text start="253.459" dur="3.45">bubble the Treasury bond bubble the</text>
  <text start="255.379" dur="4.741">stock market bubble the derivative</text>
  <text start="256.909" dur="5.671">bubble the housing bubble you name it we</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="4.019">have a bubble for it and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.58" dur="4.079">seeing right now all of this has been</text>
  <text start="264.139" dur="6.301">created by the central banks all of it</text>
  <text start="266.659" dur="7.38">is being propped up and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="270.44" dur="6.24">come crashing down now we realize that</text>
  <text start="274.039" dur="7.461">the derivative bubble is absolutely</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="7.65">gigantic and the United States has an</text>
  <text start="281.5" dur="4.419">incredible amount of exposure and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="3.57">talking about the banks in the United</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="6.571">States to derivative derivative</text>
  <text start="287.9" dur="9.66">contracts they exceed over 3 30 trillion</text>
  <text start="292.49" dur="5.83">dollars and the US banks the biggest US</text>
  <text start="297.56" dur="2.8">banks</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="5.34">collectively have more than two hundred</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="6.48">and forty seven trillion dollars of</text>
  <text start="303.66" dur="5.52">exposure to derivative contracts that is</text>
  <text start="306.84" dur="5.85">an amount of money that is more than</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="7.62">thirteen times the size of the u.s.</text>
  <text start="312.69" dur="7.89">national debt and it is a ticking time</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="6.12">bomb and globally what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="320.58" dur="6.74">that this derivative these derivative</text>
  <text start="322.92" dur="7.59">contracts they are a staggering 552</text>
  <text start="327.32" dur="4.39">trillion dollars and this is according</text>
  <text start="330.51" dur="4.8">to the bank for international</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="6.24">settlements now a derivative is a</text>
  <text start="335.31" dur="4.98">security with a price that is dependent</text>
  <text start="337.95" dur="4.44">upon or derived from one or more</text>
  <text start="340.29" dur="4.32">underlying assets the derivative itself</text>
  <text start="342.39" dur="5.12">it&amp;#39;s a contract between two or more</text>
  <text start="344.61" dur="5.58">parties based upon the assets or assets</text>
  <text start="347.51" dur="6.34">its value is determined by fluctuations</text>
  <text start="350.19" dur="5.94">in the underlying asset the most common</text>
  <text start="353.85" dur="4.98">underlying assets are stocks bonds</text>
  <text start="356.13" dur="6.78">commodities currencies interest rates</text>
  <text start="358.83" dur="6.3">market indexes and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="362.91" dur="5.16">derivative market it&amp;#39;s basically like a</text>
  <text start="365.13" dur="5.13">legalized type of gambling and these</text>
  <text start="368.07" dur="4.95">banks they are exposure compared to the</text>
  <text start="370.26" dur="5.64">amount of assets they have our amazing</text>
  <text start="373.02" dur="6.27">take Citigroup for instance their total</text>
  <text start="375.9" dur="6.15">assets is about 1.8 trillion their</text>
  <text start="379.29" dur="5.73">exposure to derivatives is about fifty</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="5.97">three trillion JPMorgan their total</text>
  <text start="385.02" dur="6.36">assets is about 2.4 trillion their total</text>
  <text start="388.02" dur="6.63">exposure is about fifty one trillion two</text>
  <text start="391.38" dur="7.38">derivatives Goldman Sachs their total</text>
  <text start="394.65" dur="6.51">assets are about 880 trillion dollar 880</text>
  <text start="398.76" dur="4.92">billion dollars a little bit less than a</text>
  <text start="401.16" dur="6.93">trillion and their total exposure to</text>
  <text start="403.68" dur="6.51">derivatives is 51 trillion bank of</text>
  <text start="408.09" dur="4.95">america has about two point one trillion</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="6.6">in assets their exposure to derivatives</text>
  <text start="413.04" dur="6.75">is 45 trillion and this goes on and on</text>
  <text start="416.79" dur="8.36">and on so there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="419.79" dur="9.36">exposure and we can see when this system</text>
  <text start="425.15" dur="6.79">falls apart it&amp;#39;s going to be a domino</text>
  <text start="429.15" dur="5.64">effect and it will bring down each</text>
  <text start="431.94" dur="6.09">one of these banks and this is why they</text>
  <text start="434.79" dur="6.69">have the balance set up and ready to go</text>
  <text start="438.03" dur="7.14">this is why come January the European</text>
  <text start="441.48" dur="6.66">banks European countries are supposed to</text>
  <text start="445.17" dur="4.35">have their bail in documents ready to go</text>
  <text start="448.14" dur="2.85">now there are certain countries that are</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="4.56">still fighting this saying that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.99" dur="6.21">not going to do this but they want</text>
  <text start="454.08" dur="5.46">everyone in line for what is coming and</text>
  <text start="457.2" dur="5.64">what is coming well that is the collapse</text>
  <text start="459.54" dur="5.88">of the entire system you do not put all</text>
  <text start="462.84" dur="5.52">of this into place unless you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="465.42" dur="6.96">expecting something to occur and we have</text>
  <text start="468.36" dur="6.99">been seeing balance in Cyprus we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="472.38" dur="5.36">it in banks in Italy we know Greece is</text>
  <text start="475.35" dur="6.9">getting ready to do balance as soon as</text>
  <text start="477.74" dur="6.61">2016 hits and Portugal right now has</text>
  <text start="482.25" dur="7.44">announced for the second time in less</text>
  <text start="484.35" dur="7.65">than two years some type of Balon this</text>
  <text start="489.69" dur="4.56">time around it was been if the country</text>
  <text start="492" dur="4.14">seventh largest banking group which ran</text>
  <text start="494.25" dur="4.2">into trouble and it couldn&amp;#39;t repay</text>
  <text start="496.14" dur="5.25">previous government cash injections so</text>
  <text start="498.45" dur="6.03">what do they do well they have a bailout</text>
  <text start="501.39" dur="6.33">for the bailout that they had and then</text>
  <text start="504.48" dur="7.08">they turned inside and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="8.55">go after the people&amp;#39;s money which is</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="7.71">called a ballon and we know this has</text>
  <text start="516.27" dur="5.87">been done in many different areas and</text>
  <text start="519.27" dur="7.74">they are preparing to do this across</text>
  <text start="522.14" dur="10.09">europe in canada in the united states</text>
  <text start="527.01" dur="7.47">and many other countries because they</text>
  <text start="532.23" dur="6.02">realize when this system comes crashing</text>
  <text start="534.48" dur="8.31">down they&amp;#39;ll have no alternative but to</text>
  <text start="538.25" dur="7">go ahead and take the people&amp;#39;s money and</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="5.19">give them worthless banks dog why would</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="6.06">you want a piece of paper from the bank</text>
  <text start="547.98" dur="5.94">if the bank is failing it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="551.31" dur="4.74">whatsoever what do you do with it you</text>
  <text start="553.92" dur="5.04">can&amp;#39;t do anything with it and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="556.05" dur="8.46">going to see this happen most likely in</text>
  <text start="558.96" dur="6.58">the near future now we understand the</text>
  <text start="564.51" dur="3.939">IMF makes</text>
  <text start="565.54" dur="4.289">lot of predictions they tell us that you</text>
  <text start="568.449" dur="2.971">know everything is going to be great and</text>
  <text start="569.829" dur="3.93">then all of a sudden everything doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="571.42" dur="5.849">turn out to be that great we see</text>
  <text start="573.759" dur="4.95">christine lagarde is now saying that the</text>
  <text start="577.269" dur="4.171">global economic growth will be</text>
  <text start="578.709" dur="4.471">disappointing next year and the outlook</text>
  <text start="581.44" dur="4.35">for the medium term has also</text>
  <text start="583.18" dur="5.31">deteriorated so what is she really</text>
  <text start="585.79" dur="5.82">saying she&amp;#39;s really saying it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="588.49" dur="4.92">be a lot worse than we really predicted</text>
  <text start="591.61" dur="3.149">now remember when they tell us that</text>
  <text start="593.41" dur="4.049">they&amp;#39;re going to see three percent</text>
  <text start="594.759" dur="5.01">growth globally they always take that</text>
  <text start="597.459" dur="4.56">and it goes down to 2.7 it was done to</text>
  <text start="599.769" dur="3.93">2.5 and they keep dropping the numbers</text>
  <text start="602.019" dur="4.32">now they&amp;#39;re already telling us it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="603.699" dur="4.83">going to be disappointing we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="606.339" dur="5.401">things start to deteriorate what this</text>
  <text start="608.529" dur="4.92">tells us is it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse</text>
  <text start="611.74" dur="3.45">than what they&amp;#39;re saying and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="613.449" dur="3.661">saying the prospect of rising interest</text>
  <text start="615.19" dur="4.319">rates in the United States and the</text>
  <text start="617.11" dur="4.38">economic slowdown in China they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="619.509" dur="4.01">contributing to this uncertainty and</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="4.289">higher risk of economic vulnerability</text>
  <text start="623.519" dur="4">worldwide it&amp;#39;s nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="625.779" dur="4.201">central bank has to do with everything</text>
  <text start="627.519" dur="6.241">else and they&amp;#39;re saying the spillover</text>
  <text start="629.98" dur="5.339">from the Fed hike and everything else is</text>
  <text start="633.76" dur="5.069">going to hit the emerging markets and</text>
  <text start="635.319" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re going to be put into a huge</text>
  <text start="638.829" dur="4.2">amount of risk and there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="640.449" dur="5.101">problems there and this is going to</text>
  <text start="643.029" dur="6.631">spread throughout the global economies</text>
  <text start="645.55" dur="5.729">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now because</text>
  <text start="649.66" dur="3.27">normally what the IMF comes out at the</text>
  <text start="651.279" dur="3.391">end of the year they tell us how great</text>
  <text start="652.93" dur="3.33">the next year is going to be how we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="654.67" dur="3.63">going to see incredible growth well of</text>
  <text start="656.26" dur="3.809">course towards the end of the year they</text>
  <text start="658.3" dur="3.18">completely backtracked on all that now</text>
  <text start="660.069" dur="3.361">they&amp;#39;re telling us it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="661.48" dur="6.45">little disappointing which tells us it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="663.43" dur="8.779">going to be a lot worse and we all need</text>
  <text start="667.93" dur="6.899">to be ready for this because as we know</text>
  <text start="672.209" dur="6.61">that this system everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="674.829" dur="7.291">been looking at retail real estate GDP</text>

  <text start="685.5" dur="6.55">what&amp;#39;s going on geopolitically it is all</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="4.32">leading up to one thing and that is a</text>
  <text start="692.05" dur="3.51">complete and utter collapse of the</text>

  <text start="696.94" dur="4.53">in the new spending bill that the United</text>
  <text start="699.52" dur="4.05">States passed of course it included</text>
  <text start="701.47" dur="5.1">sissa which President Obama said he was</text>
  <text start="703.57" dur="5.52">going to veto but of course he didn&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="706.57" dur="7.62">see that they have given away the voting</text>
  <text start="709.09" dur="11.36">rights to the emerging markets and they</text>
  <text start="714.19" dur="11.34">will have additional voting percentage</text>
  <text start="720.45" dur="8.61">to vote and Vito whatever the IMF comes</text>
  <text start="725.53" dur="7.53">up with so the emerging countries now</text>
  <text start="729.06" dur="10">including China Russia they will all</text>
  <text start="733.06" dur="11.49">have the power to veto decisions by the</text>
  <text start="739.06" dur="8.73">IMF compared to before when the United</text>
  <text start="744.55" dur="7.17">States had most of the voting power so</text>
  <text start="747.79" dur="7.95">right now we see that things are being</text>
  <text start="751.72" dur="8.34">shifted from the West over to the east</text>
  <text start="755.74" dur="8.01">and we see at this point that the BRIC</text>
  <text start="760.06" dur="8.67">countries are going to have more power</text>
  <text start="763.75" dur="8.28">now in deciding their fate and at this</text>

  <text start="788.26" dur="5.58">something we&amp;#39;re all eyes are off of them</text>
  <text start="790.6" dur="7.65">and it puts it on other countries or</text>
