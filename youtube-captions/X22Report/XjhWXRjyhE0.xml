  <text start="64.61" dur="5.009">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="67.009" dur="5.671">financial news now when we look around</text>
  <text start="69.619" dur="6.031">the world we see the people are choosing</text>
  <text start="72.68" dur="4.2">to move away from the establishment the</text>
  <text start="75.65" dur="3.45">elite not just here in the United States</text>
  <text start="76.88" dur="4.47">but we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Italy where they</text>
  <text start="79.1" dur="5.67">had the referendum we saw it in the UK</text>
  <text start="81.35" dur="5.58">where they had the brexit and we see</text>
  <text start="84.77" dur="3.9">here in the united states and we can see</text>
  <text start="86.93" dur="3.75">the establishment is reeling right now</text>
  <text start="88.67" dur="4.26">because they don&amp;#39;t want to give up our</text>
  <text start="90.68" dur="4.26">and remember the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="92.93" dur="4.469">establishment the elite they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="94.94" dur="6.45">to give up power whatsoever they will</text>
  <text start="97.399" dur="7.321">continually try to fight to get what</text>
  <text start="101.39" dur="7.17">they want and we&amp;#39;re already seeing this</text>
  <text start="104.72" dur="6.149">Russian hacking spreading across the</text>
  <text start="108.56" dur="3.839">globe I mean in Germany right now</text>
  <text start="110.869" dur="4.291">they&amp;#39;re saying their presidential</text>
  <text start="112.399" dur="6.72">elections well they might be hacked in</text>
  <text start="115.16" dur="7.17">the UK we have a former Labour member of</text>
  <text start="119.119" dur="6.631">the Parliament saying that mmmm Russian</text>
  <text start="122.33" dur="6.83">hacking might have swayed the EU</text>
  <text start="125.75" dur="7.17">referendum vote in favor of brexit and</text>
  <text start="129.16" dur="6.37">this is coming from Ben Bradshaw he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="5.46">joined the parade and of course what</text>
  <text start="135.53" dur="6.959">he&amp;#39;s saying that the hacking here in the</text>
  <text start="138.38" dur="6.48">United States is proven it&amp;#39;s not proven</text>
  <text start="142.489" dur="5.131">there&amp;#39;s no evidence but we can see why</text>
  <text start="144.86" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re all doing this right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.62" dur="6.93">creating this illusionary story to</text>
  <text start="151.01" dur="7.26">convince everyone why they need to</text>
  <text start="154.55" dur="6.53">cancel what has happened so far the</text>
  <text start="158.27" dur="7.53">brexit as we know they have not</text>
  <text start="161.08" dur="7.45">implemented article 50 Italy is getting</text>
  <text start="165.8" dur="4.95">prepared to vote on if they should stay</text>
  <text start="168.53" dur="5.28">with the EU or not they&amp;#39;re going down</text>
  <text start="170.75" dur="6.39">that path and we can see that all of</text>
  <text start="173.81" dur="5.7">these countries well they want all of</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="3.98">this stopped and I shouldn&amp;#39;t say the</text>
  <text start="179.51" dur="5.24">countries I should say the lis</text>
  <text start="181.12" dur="6.089">the central banking system the elite the</text>
  <text start="184.75" dur="3.659">establishment and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="187.209" dur="3.36">doing right now because what we see</text>
  <text start="188.409" dur="4.981">happening is that they want total</text>
  <text start="190.569" dur="6.271">control because the economy around the</text>
  <text start="193.39" dur="6.75">world is collapsing they&amp;#39;ve already set</text>
  <text start="196.84" dur="5.34">the time the day for this collapse now</text>
  <text start="200.14" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this collapse for</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="3.54">quite a while here in the United States</text>
  <text start="204.61" dur="2.909">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about unemployment</text>
  <text start="205.72" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about real estate</text>
  <text start="207.519" dur="4.711">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about GDP we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="210.43" dur="3.48">talking about corporate defaults we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="212.23" dur="4.11">been talking about delinquencies on auto</text>
  <text start="213.91" dur="4.949">loans we&amp;#39;ve been talking about pretty</text>
  <text start="216.34" dur="5.459">much every piece of economic sector we</text>
  <text start="218.859" dur="4.531">can get our hands on and we know from</text>
  <text start="221.799" dur="3.72">our analysis and everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="223.39" dur="3.87">been looking at where we say well the</text>
  <text start="225.519" dur="4.231">unemployment rate cannot be 4.6 percent</text>
  <text start="227.26" dur="5.28">it makes no sense because when we look</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="4.47">at other economic indicators and we feed</text>
  <text start="232.54" dur="3.779">it all back to the unemployment rate it</text>
  <text start="234.22" dur="4.68">makes no sense I mean for instance</text>
  <text start="236.319" dur="5.361">retail sales they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="3.959">us that everyone&amp;#39;s employed right now</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="4.75">should</text>
  <text start="242.859" dur="7.74">so that should mean that retail should</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="7.44">be incredible because they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="250.599" dur="5.181">the Dow is hitting 20,000 points the Fed</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="4.049">is raising interest rates</text>
  <text start="255.78" dur="6.699">unemployment is very low GDP is very</text>
  <text start="257.919" dur="9.241">high and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="262.479" dur="7.891">retail is going nowhere why because</text>
  <text start="267.16" dur="5.1">people aren&amp;#39;t spending they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="5.16">the jobs they don&amp;#39;t have the money</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="5.939">they&amp;#39;re not spending and right now in</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="3.98">the month of November remember in the</text>
  <text start="278.199" dur="3.831">month of November we have Black Friday</text>
  <text start="279.51" dur="7.9">Cyber Monday</text>
  <text start="282.03" dur="7.99">retail sales they only moved up point</text>
  <text start="287.41" dur="4.759">one percent month on month they thought</text>
  <text start="290.02" dur="4.32">it was going to rise point three percent</text>
  <text start="292.169" dur="5.411">now one of the biggest drivers of</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="5.19">weakness was Motor Vehicles sales they</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="6.72">tumbled by 0.5% month a month in</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="7.98">November but when we look at this we can</text>
  <text start="304.3" dur="8.1">see it wasn&amp;#39;t just Motor Vehicles we see</text>
  <text start="307.51" dur="6.3">that department stores well they are</text>
  <text start="312.4" dur="4.38">down</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="8.04">negative point two percent during the</text>
  <text start="316.78" dur="10.2">holiday season we see that Sporting</text>
  <text start="321.85" dur="9.6">Goods hobbies books music stores they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.98" dur="7.2">down negative 1 percent miscellaneous</text>
  <text start="331.45" dur="7.469">store retailers down negative 0.8</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="7.77">percent and the rest are 0.1% in the</text>
  <text start="338.919" dur="8.281">positive range maybe 0.2 but very very</text>
  <text start="341.95" dur="7.02">low for this time of year so we can see</text>
  <text start="347.2" dur="4.41">right now from what we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="348.97" dur="4.71">at where we&amp;#39;re saying that this</text>
  <text start="351.61" dur="7.83">unemployment number is fake phony and</text>
  <text start="353.68" dur="8.37">false well it still holds true when we</text>
  <text start="359.44" dur="4.35">look at the real estate market with</text>
  <text start="362.05" dur="6.63">mortgage applications they have fallen</text>
  <text start="363.79" dur="10.67">almost non-stop since July 4th and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="368.68" dur="10.02">at 2016 lows we&amp;#39;re at the same level</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="6.34">where we were back in 2008 during the</text>
  <text start="378.7" dur="6.51">Lehman crisis during the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="380.8" dur="7.95">and when we look at this we know that</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="7.11">interest rates moved up a little bit now</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="7.89">think about this they moved up a little</text>
  <text start="392.32" dur="6.99">bit a smidge and just moving the</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="5.16">interest rates a smidge which happened</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="4.35">in 2008 interest rates started to rise</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="6.06">and people can afford their homes they</text>
  <text start="403.66" dur="6.99">just left them well we noticed that</text>
  <text start="407.86" dur="5.55">before the interest rates moved up there</text>
  <text start="410.65" dur="5.67">were 8 point 3 million people who would</text>
  <text start="413.41" dur="5.87">be able to maybe take out a loan when</text>
  <text start="416.32" dur="6.18">the interest rates moved up those</text>
  <text start="419.28" dur="5.05">individuals were thrown out of the</text>
  <text start="422.5" dur="6.36">market how many were thrown out of the</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="6">market 4 million half so this is a</text>
  <text start="428.86" dur="5.1">problem for real estate because if</text>
  <text start="430.33" dur="5.94">interest rates continually rise this is</text>
  <text start="433.96" dur="4.2">going to be a huge problem now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="436.27" dur="3.74">just real estate because remember</text>
  <text start="438.16" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s new construction there&amp;#39;s lumber</text>
  <text start="440.01" dur="5.409">there&amp;#39;s concrete sales</text>
  <text start="443.65" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s sheetrock sales there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="445.419" dur="4.651">electricians there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.19" dur="5.91">appliances there&amp;#39;s furniture it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="450.07" dur="7.44">connected and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="453.1" dur="6.3">now is that with high home prices</text>
  <text start="457.51" dur="4.28">because remember they inflated these</text>
  <text start="459.4" dur="5.57">bubbles with high mortgage rates the</text>
  <text start="461.79" dur="7.87">real estate market is doomed</text>
  <text start="464.97" dur="8.11">we see industrial production well for</text>
  <text start="469.66" dur="7.56">the 15th straight month in a row it is</text>
  <text start="473.08" dur="7.41">declined this is the longest streak in</text>
  <text start="477.22" dur="5.94">US history without a recession I feel</text>
  <text start="480.49" dur="6.18">like I&amp;#39;m saying this quite a bit we were</text>
  <text start="483.16" dur="5.37">saying this economic indicator has been</text>
  <text start="486.67" dur="4.71">declining for eight months twelve months</text>
  <text start="488.53" dur="6.18">and this is the longest streak you know</text>
  <text start="491.38" dur="5.73">without declaring a recession and we can</text>
  <text start="494.71" dur="4.98">see right now that this is continuing</text>
  <text start="497.11" dur="4.98">every economic indicator that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="499.69" dur="4.14">looking at and we go back to 2008 which</text>
  <text start="502.09" dur="8.82">we saw the same exact thing happen it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.83" dur="9.06">happening right now we see GDP well that</text>
  <text start="510.91" dur="4.92">looks like it is declining why business</text>
  <text start="512.89" dur="5.49">inventories have dropped 0.2% month a</text>
  <text start="515.83" dur="4.29">month in October the last time we saw a</text>
  <text start="518.38" dur="5.789">bigger month a month drop was September</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="8.72">of 2011 and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="524.169" dur="7.861">GDP not going to be doing as well as</text>
  <text start="528.84" dur="8.77">Obama the central bank wants us to</text>
  <text start="532.03" dur="7.98">believe now we understand that Janet</text>
  <text start="537.61" dur="7.08">Yellen came out she made her little</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="8.43">speech and the Fed raised the interest</text>
  <text start="544.69" dur="5.61">rates 25 basis points very small we</text>
  <text start="548.44" dur="4.8">already see the stock market declining</text>
  <text start="550.3" dur="5.34">and most likely the market was pumped up</text>
  <text start="553.24" dur="3.78">so high because they knew once the Fed</text>
  <text start="555.64" dur="2.85">raised the interest rates and we knew</text>
  <text start="557.02" dur="2.94">they would have to do that or their</text>
  <text start="558.49" dur="2.79">credibility would have been shot because</text>
  <text start="559.96" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us all year they</text>
  <text start="561.28" dur="3.84">were going to raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="562.69" dur="5.31">maybe two three times this year but they</text>
  <text start="565.12" dur="4.08">never did it well they&amp;#39;re doing it the</text>
  <text start="568" dur="2.79">set they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing again</text>
  <text start="569.2" dur="3.9">for next year oh yes we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="570.79" dur="4.23">raising this two or three times in 2017</text>
  <text start="573.1" dur="4.02">which we know there&amp;#39;s no way they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="575.02" dur="5.22">going to do this now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.12" dur="4.019">signaling is they are ready to bring</text>
  <text start="580.24" dur="3.629">this economy</text>
  <text start="581.139" dur="4.081">down because really think about it Japan</text>
  <text start="583.869" dur="3.39">is a negative interest rates Europe is a</text>
  <text start="585.22" dur="3.149">negative interest rates and the united</text>
  <text start="587.259" dur="3.48">states government central bankers</text>
  <text start="588.369" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re raising the interest rates very</text>
  <text start="590.739" dur="6.54">slowly and you know what kind of fact</text>
  <text start="594.819" dur="4.86">this is going to have on the entire</text>
  <text start="597.279" dur="4.29">system with the debt with real estate</text>
  <text start="599.679" dur="4.62">and everything else it would be a</text>
  <text start="601.569" dur="4.26">complete disaster they know this this is</text>
  <text start="604.299" dur="4.65">why they&amp;#39;re only doing 25 basis point</text>
  <text start="605.829" dur="5.04">but it is a signal that things are going</text>
  <text start="608.949" dur="6.271">to dramatically change they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="610.869" dur="7.14">ready to bring this system down Harry</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="5.789">dent is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying well</text>
  <text start="618.009" dur="5.971">it looks like the market might be</text>
  <text start="621.009" dur="6.721">dropping right now it might be coming</text>
  <text start="623.98" dur="7.319">down seven to seventeen thousand points</text>
  <text start="627.73" dur="7.5">maybe even lower than that and this is</text>
  <text start="631.299" dur="5.28">very similar to the 1930s and it looks</text>
  <text start="635.23" dur="4.889">like we&amp;#39;re heading in that direction</text>
  <text start="636.579" dur="8.04">once again but all of this has been</text>
  <text start="640.119" dur="7.83">planned from the beginning Obama is</text>
  <text start="644.619" dur="6.44">leaving office he served eight years and</text>
  <text start="647.949" dur="8.37">he&amp;#39;s leaving with the economy in</text>
  <text start="651.059" dur="6.93">recovery this is a complete setup think</text>
  <text start="656.319" dur="4.2">about what they&amp;#39;ve done in the last</text>
  <text start="657.989" dur="5.59">portion of this year with unemployment</text>
  <text start="660.519" dur="7.831">GDP the stock market and raising the</text>
  <text start="663.579" dur="7.49">interest rates it is a setup for Trump</text>
  <text start="668.35" dur="5.489">if he makes it into into the White House</text>
  <text start="671.069" dur="5.62">because we can see right now they are</text>
  <text start="673.839" dur="7.68">prepared and ready to bring this entire</text>
  <text start="676.689" dur="6.93">system down and when it hits it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="681.519" dur="5.581">to be a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="683.619" dur="7.8">think about what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="687.1" dur="8.37">in the world I mean look at the Middle</text>
  <text start="691.419" dur="6.03">East where we have the petro dollar the</text>
  <text start="695.47" dur="4.709">petro dollar right now in the Middle</text>
  <text start="697.449" dur="5.25">East guess what it is doomed out there</text>
  <text start="700.179" dur="5.551">their plan to go into all of these</text>
  <text start="702.699" dur="6.81">countries to end up in Iran to support</text>
  <text start="705.73" dur="8.82">the petro dollar well that is completely</text>
  <text start="709.509" dur="8.041">falling apart and right now</text>
  <text start="714.55" dur="5.969">all the economic indicators are showing</text>
  <text start="717.55" dur="4.62">that we&amp;#39;re in a recession that actually</text>
  <text start="720.519" dur="6">we should be entering a collapse</text>
  <text start="722.17" dur="7.46">scenario and it&amp;#39;s all being kept up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="726.519" dur="7.32">all being propped up with manipulated</text>
  <text start="729.63" dur="6.1">statistics and keeping all eyes on the</text>
  <text start="733.839" dur="6">stock market that&amp;#39;s what is happening</text>
  <text start="735.73" dur="6.03">right now and as we move into 2017 we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="739.839" dur="3.93">going to see these economic indicators</text>
