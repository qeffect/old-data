  <text start="35.52" dur="5.429">episode 968 be and today&amp;#39;s date is May</text>
  <text start="38.579" dur="5.431">11 2016 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="40.949" dur="6.18">is us disregards international law to</text>
  <text start="44.01" dur="5.97">provoke war let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="47.129" dur="6.051">economic collapse financial news now the</text>
  <text start="49.98" dur="5.609">US government they are very worried and</text>
  <text start="53.18" dur="5.409">you&amp;#39;re probably asking yourself why is</text>
  <text start="55.589" dur="5.311">the US government so worried well</text>
  <text start="58.589" dur="6.691">they&amp;#39;re worried because the amount of</text>
  <text start="60.9" dur="7.77">debt that is out there the u.s. debt the</text>
  <text start="65.28" dur="7.08">European debt debt around the world they</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="7.83">know it cannot be sustained and one of</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="6.78">the reasons why the u.s. is pushing and</text>
  <text start="76.5" dur="6.33">pushing very hard for the European</text>
  <text start="79.14" dur="9.17">nations to complete the TTIP is that</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="13.469">they&amp;#39;re nervous about European courts</text>
  <text start="88.31" dur="10.739">suing US banks for the debt crisis now</text>
  <text start="96.299" dur="6.18">the u.s. they&amp;#39;ve bombed off many</text>
  <text start="99.049" dur="5.201">speculative investments to European</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="5.221">municipalities and companies and</text>
  <text start="104.25" dur="7.71">governments and they&amp;#39;re pushing very</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="8.07">hard for Europe to find to sign the TTIP</text>
  <text start="111.96" dur="5.369">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that Europe is</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="6.27">taking notice to this and we mentioned</text>
  <text start="117.329" dur="8.941">this before but the u.s. is very nervous</text>
  <text start="122.04" dur="7.949">at this point because the debt crisis is</text>
  <text start="126.27" dur="7.26">so large that if all of these countries</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="7.59">decide to sue this is going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="8.519">problem and with the TTIP in place it</text>
  <text start="137.579" dur="8.571">takes this part away from Europe they</text>
  <text start="142.049" dur="7.47">won&amp;#39;t be able to sue and this signals us</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="6">that we are getting closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="149.519" dur="6.75">this major collapse of the entire system</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="6.28">now out in France Frances prime minister</text>
  <text start="156.269" dur="3.991">Manuel Valls announced that the</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="3.93">government would be invoking article of</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="3.51">the Constitution in order to bypass</text>
  <text start="162.36" dur="5.1">Parliament and</text>
  <text start="163.77" dur="6.48">through a labor reform bill article 49</text>
  <text start="167.46" dur="5.18">diary of Francis Constitution allows for</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="5.43">reform by decree meaning the government</text>
  <text start="172.64" dur="6.91">can completely bypass the Parliament to</text>
  <text start="175.68" dur="6">enact laws as it sees fit now President</text>
  <text start="179.55" dur="4.37">Hollande who used this article last year</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="4.56">and he pushed through a law that</text>
  <text start="183.92" dur="6.01">loosened restrictions on shops taken</text>
  <text start="186.24" dur="7.41">staying closed on Sundays now people are</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="7.05">protesting and they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="5.76">whatsoever and we see from different</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="5.3">polls that fifty percent of the French</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="4.95">public were opposed to the labor reforms</text>
  <text start="202.28" dur="3.7">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s a heavy-handed way</text>
  <text start="204.36" dur="3.51">of using the Constitution to prevent the</text>
  <text start="205.98" dur="3">nation&amp;#39;s representative from having</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re saying this is coming from</text>
  <text start="208.98" dur="5.79">Laurent ball Mel and yes this is a way</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="3.93">of saying we don&amp;#39;t care what the people</text>
  <text start="214.77" dur="5.25">say we&amp;#39;re going to do what we want to do</text>
  <text start="217.38" dur="3.75">and we found a loophole and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="220.02" dur="4.4">to use it in this way we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="221.13" dur="6.54">deal with na via now the job reform</text>
  <text start="224.42" dur="7">simplifies labor rules facilitate</text>
  <text start="227.67" dur="6.39">facilitates layoffs in case of economic</text>
  <text start="231.42" dur="6.68">slowdowns and allows companies to strike</text>
  <text start="234.06" dur="7.97">deals with their employees on overtime</text>
  <text start="238.1" dur="9.06">hmmm are they preparing for something</text>
  <text start="242.03" dur="8.65">most likely now back in March they had</text>
  <text start="247.16" dur="6.01">many different protests and France so</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="4.46">the government water down the bill they</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="4.86">took out pro-business measures such as</text>
  <text start="255.14" dur="5.98">ceiling on severance packages in case of</text>
  <text start="258.03" dur="6.51">wrongful dismissal however the retreat</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="4.89">failed to calm unions and they railed</text>
  <text start="264.54" dur="3.96">against the idea that companies could</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="6.659">bypass them and sign deals on working</text>
  <text start="268.5" dur="5.64">hours with employees representatives but</text>
  <text start="272.669" dur="5.611">it looks like at this point they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="274.14" dur="7.82">care what the people say because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="7.16">going around the representatives and the</text>
  <text start="281.96" dur="6.43">only way they can stop it is with a</text>
  <text start="285.44" dur="5.83">no-confidence vote but it looks like</text>
  <text start="288.39" dur="5.94">this didn&amp;#39;t work out looks like they</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="4.89">needed the support of 58 lawmakers for</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="3.25">the no-confidence vote and they only</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="3.279">receive 56</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="4.049">so at this point it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="299.439" dur="4.171">going through and of course the people</text>
  <text start="301.629" dur="4.171">don&amp;#39;t have a saying if you notice many</text>
  <text start="303.61" dur="7.17">countries at this point like the u.s.</text>
  <text start="305.8" dur="8.31">like the UK France Spain Italy many of</text>
  <text start="310.78" dur="5.189">these countries Germany Australia Canada</text>
  <text start="314.11" dur="4.709">I mean most of the private was essential</text>
  <text start="315.969" dur="5.25">Bank countries they&amp;#39;re doing things even</text>
  <text start="318.819" dur="6.991">though the people don&amp;#39;t want this to be</text>
  <text start="321.219" dur="5.91">done and this shows us that none of</text>
  <text start="325.81" dur="3.96">these countries are working for the</text>
  <text start="327.129" dur="5.85">people yes sometimes when there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="329.77" dur="6.81">much pressure they&amp;#39;ll cave but if you</text>
  <text start="332.979" dur="6.301">see a protest of hundreds of thousands</text>
  <text start="336.58" dur="6.57">of people and they&amp;#39;re saying no we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="339.28" dur="6.21">want this I think that&amp;#39;s a signal that</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="6.109">maybe they should look at something else</text>
  <text start="345.49" dur="6.6">but governments they&amp;#39;re doing everything</text>
  <text start="349.259" dur="5.62">for themselves for central banks for</text>
  <text start="352.09" dur="8.37">corporations for foreign governments not</text>
  <text start="354.879" dur="8.271">for the people now out in Crimea Putin</text>
  <text start="360.46" dur="7.59">has come out and said Crimea right now</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="9.489">has now have a the final electrical</text>
  <text start="368.05" dur="7.47">supply line being fed into Crimea they</text>
  <text start="372.639" dur="6.03">no longer need electricity from Kiev</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="6.619">they&amp;#39;re completely independent for power</text>
  <text start="378.669" dur="6.691">now they do not need Kiev whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="382.139" dur="5.321">this new line the fourth one will bring</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="5.64">a total power from Russia to Crimea of</text>
  <text start="387.46" dur="5.34">about 800 megawatts which combined with</text>
  <text start="391" dur="4.199">the peninsula&amp;#39;s own capacity should be</text>
  <text start="392.8" dur="6.44">enough to satisfy the demand they need</text>
  <text start="395.199" dur="7.291">and we can see right now that Kiev</text>
  <text start="399.24" dur="5.109">cannot use this as a black male tactic</text>
  <text start="402.49" dur="5.94">like they&amp;#39;ve done in the past now the</text>
  <text start="404.349" dur="6.06">OSCE they are considering arming their</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="3.72">representatives in Ukraine because</text>
  <text start="410.409" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re coming under attack and I think</text>
  <text start="412.15" dur="4.259">this is what poroshenko wants I think</text>
  <text start="414.339" dur="5.101">this was staged because he wants the</text>
  <text start="416.409" dur="5.43">OSCE police force armed force in the</text>
  <text start="419.44" dur="4.8">south eastern area and it looks like</text>
  <text start="421.839" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re trying to maneuver a way to get</text>
  <text start="424.24" dur="5.5">the osc in this area but because every</text>
  <text start="427.659" dur="7.331">time they&amp;#39;re in there they&amp;#39;re being at</text>
  <text start="429.74" dur="6.63">and now we see armed OSC officers coming</text>
  <text start="434.99" dur="3.45">into this area we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="436.37" dur="4.889">watch a situation very closely because</text>
  <text start="438.44" dur="5.039">we realize that most likely there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="441.259" dur="6.511">going to be a summer offensive in</text>
  <text start="443.479" dur="8.31">Ukraine now as we know Obama has</text>
  <text start="447.77" dur="6.75">continually tried to provoke Russia and</text>
  <text start="451.789" dur="5.641">China and we see right now both Putin</text>
  <text start="454.52" dur="5.239">and G Jinping they&amp;#39;ve responded</text>
  <text start="457.43" dur="5.93">correctly they have refused to back down</text>
  <text start="459.759" dur="8.171">to Obama&amp;#39;s overt aggressive threat of</text>
  <text start="463.36" dur="7.299">war but neither of them have allowed</text>
  <text start="467.93" dur="6.81">themselves to be provoked in some sort</text>
  <text start="470.659" dur="8.961">of tit-for-tat in the South China Sea in</text>
  <text start="474.74" dur="8.399">South Korea in Ukraine in all the areas</text>
  <text start="479.62" dur="6.94">so whatever the White House is doing at</text>
  <text start="483.139" dur="6.631">this point to provoke war it is not</text>
  <text start="486.56" dur="6.87">working with China and Russia at this</text>
  <text start="489.77" dur="6.75">point because they realize exactly what</text>
  <text start="493.43" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and it seems at</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="4.47">this point they&amp;#39;re not going to give it</text>
  <text start="498.11" dur="5.549">to him where he&amp;#39;s trying to push war now</text>
  <text start="500.99" dur="6.06">of course is it just him alone now we</text>
  <text start="503.659" dur="7.731">know Obama is controlled by the central</text>
  <text start="507.05" dur="7.349">bankers by the elites the neocons and</text>
  <text start="511.39" dur="7.93">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that this entire</text>
  <text start="514.399" dur="8.671">group their main objective is to start</text>
  <text start="519.32" dur="7.8">war now they&amp;#39;re going to try to push war</text>
  <text start="523.07" dur="6.63">anyway they possibly can we realize that</text>
  <text start="527.12" dur="5.19">the US and NATO they&amp;#39;ve been bringing in</text>
  <text start="529.7" dur="7.11">military assets military troops into the</text>
  <text start="532.31" dur="6.839">Baltic region NATO maneuvering their</text>
  <text start="536.81" dur="6.18">military assets troops into this area</text>
  <text start="539.149" dur="5.31">and the Pentagon they plan to</text>
  <text start="542.99" dur="3.3">permanently deploy American troops tanks</text>
  <text start="544.459" dur="4.111">and other armored vehicles in Eastern</text>
  <text start="546.29" dur="4.919">Europe according to the US department of</text>
  <text start="548.57" dur="5.55">defense troops will be deployed in</text>
  <text start="551.209" dur="6.241">Eastern Europe and they&amp;#39;ll include 250</text>
  <text start="554.12" dur="5.579">tanks Bradley combat vehicles howitzers</text>
  <text start="557.45" dur="5.67">and more than 1,700 other vehicles and</text>
  <text start="559.699" dur="3.911">trucks now we have to remember how</text>
  <text start="563.12" dur="3.159">they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="563.61" dur="4.74">this and we discussed yesterday how the</text>
  <text start="566.279" dur="5.191">u.s. continually sites international law</text>
  <text start="568.35" dur="5.58">about the sea when Congress never</text>
  <text start="571.47" dur="4.739">ratified it and this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="573.93" dur="6.75">with military ships has to do with</text>
  <text start="576.209" dur="9.391">maritime everyday ships passing through</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="9.089">this area but we see the u.s. kind of</text>
  <text start="585.6" dur="6.33">disregards international law now what</text>
  <text start="589.769" dur="6.57">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the language</text>
  <text start="591.93" dur="7.649">regulation that allegedly no NATO</text>
  <text start="596.339" dur="6.421">military will be deployed permanently on</text>
  <text start="599.579" dur="5.731">the soil of former Warsaw Pact States</text>
  <text start="602.76" dur="7.17">takes into account the nato-russia</text>
  <text start="605.31" dur="5.91">agreement of 1997 back then the verbal</text>
  <text start="609.93" dur="4.32">commitment of US Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="611.22" dur="5.94">James Baker had been formalized that in</text>
  <text start="614.25" dur="5.22">time to come no NATO troops would ever</text>
  <text start="617.16" dur="5.73">be stationed east of the former Iron</text>
  <text start="619.47" dur="8.64">Curtain now meanwhile angle lemarchal</text>
  <text start="622.89" dur="10.41">NATO the u.s. they said okay permanent</text>
  <text start="628.11" dur="7.62">troops well we can get around this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="633.3" dur="7.34">going to say the troops are going to</text>
  <text start="635.73" dur="7.919">rotate now we&amp;#39;ve seen this before in</text>
  <text start="640.64" dur="5.02">Iraq they have an agreement with the</text>
  <text start="643.649" dur="4.041">Iraqi government that there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="645.66" dur="5.52">supposed to be thirty-eight hundred plus</text>
  <text start="647.69" dur="5.41">permanent soldiers in Iraq the way the</text>
  <text start="651.18" dur="4.38">US gets around this is says oh the other</text>
  <text start="653.1" dur="4.71">five thousand their temporary and we</text>
  <text start="655.56" dur="3.66">have more temporaries coming the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="657.81" dur="3.75">government says what&amp;#39;s the expiration</text>
  <text start="659.22" dur="5.04">date we don&amp;#39;t have one but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.56" dur="4.83">temporary actually back in 1971</text>
  <text start="664.26" dur="4.939">President Nixon said coming off the gold</text>
  <text start="666.39" dur="7.77">standard was temporary that&amp;#39;s the long</text>
  <text start="669.199" dur="9.731">period of temporary time here and we see</text>
  <text start="674.16" dur="7.859">that they use this to get around the</text>
  <text start="678.93" dur="6.81">laws same thing with the ceasefire in</text>
  <text start="682.019" dur="7.171">Syria well it&amp;#39;s the Free Syrian Army who</text>
  <text start="685.74" dur="5.4">is the Free Syrian Army ah we can&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="689.19" dur="4.5">you who that is but we&amp;#39;d like to include</text>
  <text start="691.14" dur="5.85">al-nusrah and al-qaeda with the Free</text>
  <text start="693.69" dur="3.72">Syrian Army and of course Russia had a</text>
  <text start="696.99" dur="2.49">site</text>
  <text start="697.41" dur="5.07">the UN regulations say no al Qaeda is a</text>
  <text start="699.48" dur="5.13">terrorist group but we can see this is</text>
  <text start="702.48" dur="7.109">exactly what they do they get around</text>
  <text start="704.61" dur="7.95">these laws by manipulating them a little</text>
  <text start="709.589" dur="5.571">bit and of course what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="712.56" dur="4.74">is Russia&amp;#39;s going to see this and</text>
  <text start="715.16" dur="6.159">they&amp;#39;re going to say okay if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="717.3" dur="7.11">going to place weaponry troops in this</text>
  <text start="721.319" dur="4.5">area and they have 4,000 here and then</text>
  <text start="724.41" dur="3.659">they rotate the four thousand eight they</text>
  <text start="725.819" dur="5.07">bring four thousand more in they still</text>
  <text start="728.069" dur="7.051">have four thousand so we&amp;#39;re going to set</text>
  <text start="730.889" dur="7.171">up our military asses and troops within</text>
  <text start="735.12" dur="5.459">our country to protect ourselves you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="738.06" dur="4.379">not doing outside the country like the</text>
  <text start="740.579" dur="6.87">US is doing they&amp;#39;re doing it within</text>
  <text start="742.439" dur="7.5">their country now out in Turkey we see</text>
  <text start="747.449" dur="4.651">the refugee crisis is getting worse and</text>
  <text start="749.939" dur="6.931">worse and we know that Iran has made a</text>
  <text start="752.1" dur="7.589">deal with the EU and we see this deal</text>
  <text start="756.87" dur="4.35">might be falling apart right now because</text>
  <text start="759.689" dur="4.14">part of the deal is that turkey passes</text>
  <text start="761.22" dur="5.84">legislation to meet 72 demands from the</text>
