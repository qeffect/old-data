  <text start="86.869" dur="4.2">had the president come out telling us</text>

  <text start="93.11" dur="4.35">agree are peddling fiction and were</text>
  <text start="95.42" dur="4.739">fools and then what happened was the</text>
  <text start="97.46" dur="4.979">market crashed even further and we saw</text>
  <text start="100.159" dur="4.201">the Atlanta Fed come out at the close of</text>
  <text start="102.439" dur="5.011">the markets saying that yeah we revised</text>
  <text start="104.36" dur="4.74">our predictions and it looks like GDP is</text>
  <text start="107.45" dur="4.47">going to be around point six percent</text>
  <text start="109.1" dur="5.729">well JP Morgan has just chimed in and</text>
  <text start="111.92" dur="6.57">they are saying well it looks like us</text>
  <text start="114.829" dur="6.21">growth has come to a screeching halt and</text>
  <text start="118.49" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re going to revise our GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="121.039" dur="5.851">and the GDP numbers are point one</text>
  <text start="123.71" dur="5.88">percent for the fourth quarter of 2015</text>
  <text start="126.89" dur="8.46">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all</text>
  <text start="129.59" dur="9.06">this is that during 2014 going into 2015</text>
  <text start="135.35" dur="6.24">the IMF the United States government the</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="5.13">central bankers Goldman Sachs JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="141.59" dur="4.47">Chase they all gave their predictions on</text>
  <text start="143.78" dur="5.22">how gdp was going to be three and a half</text>
  <text start="146.06" dur="4.769">percent three percent and as we went</text>
  <text start="149" dur="4.53">throughout the year they continually</text>
  <text start="150.829" dur="7.891">lowered it as time went on and here we</text>
  <text start="153.53" dur="8.04">are at the end of 2015 and the holiday</text>
  <text start="158.72" dur="5.91">season was a complete disaster and now</text>
  <text start="161.57" dur="6.36">the GDP numbers are worse than</text>
  <text start="164.63" dur="5.46">anyone thought they would be and all</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="6.51">their predictions are completely the</text>
  <text start="170.09" dur="6.24">opposite of what they were telling us so</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="5.49">we can see right now that this economy</text>
  <text start="176.33" dur="5.4">is going absolutely nowhere all the</text>
  <text start="179.93" dur="4.83">indicators and most of them right now</text>
  <text start="181.73" dur="7.59">are even worse than we were in 2008 and</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="6.15">2009 so moving forward this is not going</text>
  <text start="189.32" dur="3.57">to get any better actually things are</text>
  <text start="190.91" dur="4.02">going to crumble apart and fall apart</text>
  <text start="192.89" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how the markets react</text>
  <text start="194.93" dur="4.8">this evening because we know the Asian</text>
  <text start="197.54" dur="3.93">markets open first then they move to the</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="3.21">Europe and then they hit the United</text>
  <text start="201.47" dur="3.57">States and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch these to</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="3.69">see how things are going to go if things</text>
  <text start="205.04" dur="4.02">are continually to going to slide</text>
  <text start="206.63" dur="4.44">downward or is the high-frequency plunge</text>
  <text start="209.06" dur="4.14">protection team going to step in with</text>
  <text start="211.07" dur="4.14">more free money from the Fed and really</text>
  <text start="213.2" dur="3.65">pump up the markets to keep them from</text>
  <text start="215.21" dur="3.96">dropping right now because as we know</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="4.36">they don&amp;#39;t want this happening without</text>
  <text start="219.17" dur="6.84">them controlling it and bringing it down</text>
  <text start="221.21" dur="8.25">now as we know back on December second</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="5.85">NATO issued a formal invitation for</text>
  <text start="229.46" dur="5.1">Montenegro to join the military block</text>
  <text start="231.86" dur="5.67">and the government went oh okay what</text>
  <text start="234.56" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;ll do this but the people of the</text>
  <text start="237.53" dur="5.7">country said we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.35" dur="6.26">not so sure that we want to join NATO</text>
  <text start="243.23" dur="7.74">and we saw protests across Montenegro</text>
  <text start="246.61" dur="7.83">and at this point it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="250.97" dur="6.51">going to have a national referendum to</text>
  <text start="254.44" dur="5.799">determine if the country should swing</text>
  <text start="257.48" dur="5.07">towards NATO and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="8.101">that very carefully to see what happens</text>
  <text start="262.55" dur="9.45">there North Korea is reporting that they</text>
  <text start="268.34" dur="5.73">want a peace treaty with the United</text>
  <text start="272" dur="4.08">States now as we know United States</text>
  <text start="274.07" dur="3.81">government central bankers they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="276.08" dur="4.2">using propaganda to convince us that</text>
  <text start="277.88" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s nuclear explosions creating</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="3.54">these earthquakes but of course they</text>
  <text start="282.14" dur="4.23">haven&amp;#39;t put forth any proof whatsoever</text>
  <text start="283.82" dur="4.71">they have absolutely nothing but of</text>
  <text start="286.37" dur="4.65">course what they&amp;#39;ve been doing since</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="5.79">then is continually pushing propaganda</text>
  <text start="291.02" dur="5.36">increasing military budgets provoking</text>
  <text start="294.32" dur="3.929">North Korea anyway they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="296.38" dur="4.809">North Korea</text>
  <text start="298.249" dur="7.05">is saying they are willing to suspend</text>
  <text start="301.189" dur="7.88">all nuclear testing in return for a</text>
  <text start="305.299" dur="7.71">peace treaty to end the Korean War and</text>
  <text start="309.069" dur="7.6">they want the US military to stop with</text>
  <text start="313.009" dur="6.27">the exercises near their country the</text>
  <text start="316.669" dur="6.84">u.s. turned around and said now we</text>
  <text start="319.279" dur="6.87">reject that we are not going to look at</text>
  <text start="323.509" dur="3.81">the peace proposal right now and we are</text>
  <text start="326.149" dur="3.75">not going to stop with the military</text>
  <text start="327.319" dur="3.96">exercises we will continue with this</text>
  <text start="329.899" dur="3.87">because we have commitments with South</text>
  <text start="331.279" dur="4.92">Korea and we just can&amp;#39;t stop this for</text>
  <text start="333.769" dur="4.53">something called peace which is</text>
  <text start="336.199" dur="3.69">absolutely ridiculous it&amp;#39;s something so</text>
  <text start="338.299" dur="5.72">ridiculous that they won&amp;#39;t even look at</text>
  <text start="339.889" dur="7.11">I mean they&amp;#39;re asking for peace maybe</text>
  <text start="344.019" dur="4.96">just maybe the United States should say</text>
  <text start="346.999" dur="5.75">what wait a minute okay you&amp;#39;re asking</text>
  <text start="348.979" dur="7.53">for peace you&amp;#39;ll stop all nuclear</text>
  <text start="352.749" dur="6.43">testing and all we need to do is stop</text>
  <text start="356.509" dur="5.19">extra okay let&amp;#39;s pursue this but they</text>
  <text start="359.179" dur="4.38">rejected it flat out I mean we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="361.699" dur="3.69">to see how things turn out as time goes</text>
  <text start="363.559" dur="6.17">on but right now it is completely</text>
  <text start="365.389" dur="7.471">rejected right now the United States has</text>
  <text start="369.729" dur="6.49">allocated about 23 million dollars of</text>
  <text start="372.86" dur="7.109">aid to Ukraine and they are bringing in</text>
  <text start="376.219" dur="5.28">medical communication equipment and will</text>
  <text start="379.969" dur="4.7">be delivered to the Ukrainian military</text>
  <text start="381.499" dur="5.25">units participating in the training</text>
  <text start="384.669" dur="4.24">which is being conducted by the US</text>
  <text start="386.749" dur="5.82">instructors so they will be getting that</text>
  <text start="388.909" dur="6.08">aid Austria right now they are</text>
  <text start="392.569" dur="5.31">suspending the Schengen Agreement</text>
  <text start="394.989" dur="4.48">they&amp;#39;re saying that there is just too</text>
  <text start="397.879" dur="4.68">many refugees coming into their country</text>
  <text start="399.469" dur="5.43">there are no controls and they need to</text>
  <text start="402.559" dur="5.12">take control of what is going on they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="404.899" dur="5.52">saying all refugees must be controlled</text>
  <text start="407.679" dur="5.95">economic migrants must be sent to the</text>
  <text start="410.419" dur="5.97">countries of their origin and they are</text>
  <text start="413.629" dur="7.44">implementing strict monitoring systems</text>
  <text start="416.389" dur="8.43">for asylum seekers and they said that we</text>
  <text start="421.069" dur="6.24">can&amp;#39;t depend on these open borders each</text>
  <text start="424.819" dur="4.74">country at this point needs to take</text>
  <text start="427.309" dur="4.051">control of what is happening on their</text>
  <text start="429.559" dur="2.651">borders and it looks like they are</text>
  <text start="431.36" dur="4.05">definitely</text>
  <text start="432.21" dur="7.2">moving towards that area at this time</text>
  <text start="435.41" dur="5.979">now we know that the Iran sanctions they</text>
  <text start="439.41" dur="3.78">are being lifted because the IAEA has</text>
  <text start="441.389" dur="4.321">come out and they have confirmed that</text>
  <text start="443.19" dur="5.55">Iran has complied with its commitments</text>
  <text start="445.71" dur="7.489">under the agreement the p5 lot the p5</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="6.87">plus 1 agreement which they discussed so</text>
  <text start="453.199" dur="5.771">they&amp;#39;re lifting all the sanctions at</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="6.48">this time and we have to remember this</text>
  <text start="458.97" dur="5.699">whole agreement that the United States</text>
  <text start="462.09" dur="6.09">is making with Iran really has nothing</text>
  <text start="464.669" dur="6.75">to do with nuclear weapons and them</text>
  <text start="468.18" dur="6.2">creating a nuclear bomb because Iran has</text>
  <text start="471.419" dur="6.301">signed the eighth the IAEA agreement</text>
  <text start="474.38" dur="6.849">they are under the nuclear proliferation</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="7.14">agreement and they have inspections all</text>
  <text start="481.229" dur="7.381">the time this is about placing the</text>
  <text start="484.86" dur="7.619">United States dollar on their oil</text>
  <text start="488.61" dur="6.899">reserves and having Iran use the dollar</text>
  <text start="492.479" dur="4.5">to sell their oil this is what it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="495.509" dur="4.621">about and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="496.979" dur="6.271">this very carefully because we realize</text>
  <text start="500.13" dur="6">that once Iran decides not to do this</text>
  <text start="503.25" dur="5.37">and they decide to use the ruble the</text>
  <text start="506.13" dur="5.789">yuan and other currencies to sell their</text>
  <text start="508.62" dur="5.459">oil this is when trouble is going to</text>
  <text start="511.919" dur="3.48">occur in Iran from the United States</text>
  <text start="514.079" dur="3.691">this is when they&amp;#39;re going to say okay</text>
  <text start="515.399" dur="4.651">enough is enough we&amp;#39;re going in there</text>
  <text start="517.77" dur="4.949">and you have to remember we have two</text>
  <text start="520.05" dur="4.2">different entities that are putting a</text>
  <text start="522.719" dur="3.211">lot of pressure on Iran right now we</text>
  <text start="524.25" dur="5.12">have foreign governments like Israel</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="7.68">which is pushing Congress to continually</text>
  <text start="529.37" dur="6.19">place sanctions on Iran and then we have</text>
  <text start="533.61" dur="3.78">the central bankers that want to keep</text>
  <text start="535.56" dur="3.6">the system going which is controlling</text>
  <text start="537.39" dur="3.72">the White House where they want a</text>
  <text start="539.16" dur="6.33">central bank and they want the dollar on</text>
  <text start="541.11" dur="5.91">the oil reserves of Iran and this is why</text>
  <text start="545.49" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re seeing these little type of</text>
  <text start="547.02" dur="4.62">incidents happen because they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="549.18" dur="4.44">to gin something up to make sure that</text>
  <text start="551.64" dur="5.1">the sanctions steak stay in place and</text>
  <text start="553.62" dur="4.2">they want to make sure this is coming</text>
  <text start="556.74" dur="4.95">from the foreign governments to make</text>
  <text start="557.82" dur="6.72">sure that a war is started somehow some</text>
  <text start="561.69" dur="4.05">way but so far it has failed but right</text>
  <text start="564.54" dur="3.69">now</text>
  <text start="565.74" dur="5.45">of the testing of their ballistic</text>
  <text start="568.23" dur="6.15">missiles the US Treasury as they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="571.19" dur="5.65">removing sanction has decided to place</text>
  <text start="574.38" dur="6.3">sanctions on Iran because of their</text>
  <text start="576.84" dur="6.63">ballistic missile testing which is</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="5.67">completely ridiculous because weird</text>
  <text start="583.47" dur="6.42">where did this get the United States and</text>
  <text start="586.35" dur="5.7">Iran they&amp;#39;re back to the same area so</text>
  <text start="589.89" dur="4.77">they imposed sanctions on 11 companies</text>
  <text start="592.05" dur="6.06">and individuals for helping to supply</text>
  <text start="594.66" dur="5.31">Iran&amp;#39;s ballistic missile program so</text>
  <text start="598.11" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re removing sanctions they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="599.97" dur="7.05">adding sanctions and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="604.23" dur="4.83">point there is so much conflict between</text>
  <text start="607.02" dur="4.95">either side because we have two</text>
  <text start="609.06" dur="6.41">different powers controlling the United</text>
  <text start="611.97" dur="6.54">States government and if Iran does not</text>
  <text start="615.47" dur="4.66">basically meet the obligations of the</text>
  <text start="618.51" dur="3.39">White House which is controlled by the</text>
  <text start="620.13" dur="4.8">central bankers and they don&amp;#39;t place</text>
  <text start="621.9" dur="6.33">their oil on the dollar we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="624.93" dur="4.77">go to war if Iran continues down the</text>
  <text start="628.23" dur="5.31">path that they&amp;#39;re going which is a</text>
  <text start="629.7" dur="5.79">peaceful path the foreign governments</text>
  <text start="633.54" dur="7.23">are going to continually to try to</text>
  <text start="635.49" dur="8.31">provoke Iran and try to push war so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="640.77" dur="4.02">a no win situation at this point and</text>
  <text start="643.8" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this very</text>
  <text start="644.79" dur="7.05">carefully we see the Islamic state in</text>
  <text start="648.06" dur="5.58">dere airs or has abducted at least four</text>
  <text start="651.84" dur="4.74">hundred civilians after attacking</text>
  <text start="653.64" dur="6.8">government-held areas and they have</text>
  <text start="656.58" dur="8.04">captured children family members</text>
  <text start="660.44" dur="5.53">pro-regime fighters and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="664.62" dur="2.88">watch this because as we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="665.97" dur="4.11">most likely using them as human shields</text>
  <text start="667.5" dur="5.91">so this way Russia the Syrian Armed</text>
  <text start="670.08" dur="6.63">Forces can&amp;#39;t hit them Russia right now</text>
  <text start="673.41" dur="5.67">is helping the Syrian army prepare for</text>
  <text start="676.71" dur="7.77">one of their major offensives they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="679.08" dur="7.47">going into Aleppo and Aleppo is divided</text>
  <text start="684.48" dur="4.86">now between government control in the</text>
  <text start="686.55" dur="4.89">West and rebel control in the east the</text>
  <text start="689.34" dur="3.9">broader province is split as well with</text>
  <text start="691.44" dur="4.5">Isis largely in the east and rebel</text>
  <text start="693.24" dur="6.3">groups and Syria al-qaeda affiliate Al</text>

  <text start="699.54" dur="5.099">from Russia airstrikes and foreign</text>
  <text start="701.73" dur="4.95">fighters Syria&amp;#39;s armed forces are slowly</text>
  <text start="704.639" dur="5.221">advancing south and southeast of the</text>
  <text start="706.68" dur="5.7">city this will be the biggest military</text>
  <text start="709.86" dur="5.88">operation in Syria since the beginning</text>
  <text start="712.38" dur="5.759">of the war Russia is also beefing up its</text>
  <text start="715.74" dur="6.26">defensive measures they are bringing in</text>
  <text start="718.139" dur="7.231">their ka-52 attack helicopters and</text>
  <text start="722" dur="6.699">Russia is bringing in a new warfare</text>
  <text start="725.37" dur="4.8">system and this new system will be able</text>
  <text start="728.699" dur="3.87">to protect their helicopters from</text>
  <text start="730.17" dur="6.359">anti-aircraft threats and a range of</text>
  <text start="732.569" dur="8.431">several hundred kilometers and basically</text>
  <text start="736.529" dur="7.56">it will shield them against manpads and</text>
  <text start="741" dur="5.519">other type of projectiles heading</text>
  <text start="744.089" dur="4.291">towards these helicopters so we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="746.519" dur="3.961">to have to see what happens because if</text>
  <text start="748.38" dur="3.18">the Islamic state which is the proxy are</text>
  <text start="750.48" dur="5.029">in the United States government central</text>
  <text start="751.56" dur="7.079">bankers if they lose Aleppo completely</text>
  <text start="755.509" dur="6.431">basically what&amp;#39;s happening is that Assad</text>
  <text start="758.639" dur="6.63">is really taking back the country here</text>
  <text start="761.94" dur="6.68">and the United States with the proxy</text>
  <text start="765.269" dur="6.661">army is basically being pushed</text>
  <text start="768.62" dur="5.26">continuously out of the country and they</text>
  <text start="771.93" dur="4.5">will be done and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="773.88" dur="3.389">looking at all these different angles</text>
  <text start="776.43" dur="3.44">that the United States government</text>
  <text start="777.269" dur="6.451">central bankers are trying to use to</text>
  <text start="779.87" dur="7.959">demonize Assad with you know him with</text>
  <text start="783.72" dur="5.64">the starving of his people using barrel</text>
  <text start="787.829" dur="3.361">bombs using chemical weapons they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="789.36" dur="4.469">trying everything they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="791.19" dur="4.92">continually convince everyone that Assad</text>
  <text start="793.829" dur="5.541">must go and that&amp;#39;s their goal that will</text>
  <text start="796.11" dur="7.38">never change turkey right now is</text>
  <text start="799.37" dur="6.79">pleading with the Pentagon to help train</text>
  <text start="803.49" dur="5.07">fighters to secure the borders they want</text>
  <text start="806.16" dur="4.32">to set up a safe zone inside Syria</text>
  <text start="808.56" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;ve already talked to the chairman</text>
  <text start="810.48" dur="4.89">of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph</text>
  <text start="812.91" dur="5.58">Dunford General Joseph Dunford to help</text>
  <text start="815.37" dur="4.23">with the training and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="818.49" dur="3.48">have to watch this very carefully</text>
  <text start="819.6" dur="5.159">because if the United States agrees and</text>
  <text start="821.97" dur="5.52">they set up the safe zone inside Syria</text>
  <text start="824.759" dur="5.491">this is the first step where they&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="827.49" dur="5.13">this is no longer part of Syria this is</text>
  <text start="830.25" dur="3.15">a safe area where we can keep the</text>
  <text start="832.62" dur="3.09">refugees</text>
  <text start="833.4" dur="4.11">we can bring in troops from Turkey we</text>
  <text start="835.71" dur="3.81">can bring troops in from the UK from the</text>
  <text start="837.51" dur="4.56">United States to guard these refugees</text>
  <text start="839.52" dur="4.98">and they&amp;#39;ll be starting to split up</text>
  <text start="842.07" dur="3.93">Syria and we know Russia will not want</text>
  <text start="844.5" dur="4.29">this to happen so we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="846" dur="6.33">watch that scenario very very carefully</text>
  <text start="848.79" dur="5.64">now the US military is expanding its</text>
  <text start="852.33" dur="4.86">secret intelligence operations across</text>
  <text start="854.43" dur="4.65">Africa establishing a network of small</text>
  <text start="857.19" dur="3.48">air bases at the heart of the</text>
  <text start="859.08" dur="4.98">surveillance operations are small</text>
  <text start="860.67" dur="6.15">unarmed turboprop aircraft disguised as</text>
  <text start="864.06" dur="4.83">private planes they&amp;#39;re equipped with</text>
  <text start="866.82" dur="4.47">hidden sensors that can record full</text>
  <text start="868.89" dur="5.85">motion video track infrared heat</text>
  <text start="871.29" dur="5.97">patterns and vacuum up radio and cell</text>
  <text start="874.74" dur="5.79">phone signals the planes refuel on</text>
  <text start="877.26" dur="6.12">isolated air strips and we can see right</text>
  <text start="880.53" dur="4.77">now the United States is expanding its</text>
  <text start="883.38" dur="3.63">operations in Africa and you have to</text>
  <text start="885.3" dur="4.11">remember wherever Russia and China are</text>
  <text start="887.01" dur="5.28">this is why the United States is there</text>
  <text start="889.41" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re trying to establish bases all</text>
  <text start="892.29" dur="5.52">around Africa maintain control of their</text>
  <text start="895.56" dur="4.02">natural resources because this is what</text>
  <text start="897.81" dur="5.13">the private western central bankers do</text>
  <text start="899.58" dur="6.15">wherever there are natural resources and</text>
  <text start="902.94" dur="5.43">they need these natural resources they</text>
  <text start="905.73" dur="4.95">will go in they will use terrorism they</text>
  <text start="908.37" dur="5.1">will use force they will use any way</text>
  <text start="910.68" dur="5.46">they possibly can to get these areas and</text>
  <text start="913.47" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing it in Sudan we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="916.14" dur="4.32">seeing it in Nigeria we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="918.48" dur="5.04">it in all of these places instead of</text>
  <text start="920.46" dur="5.7">making economic deals they are stuck now</text>
  <text start="923.52" dur="4.59">with using terrorism because the system</text>
  <text start="926.16" dur="3.54">is coming down and this is what they</text>
  <text start="928.11" dur="4.83">have left and we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="929.7" dur="5.64">expanding throughout Africa and they are</text>
  <text start="932.94" dur="5.7">preparing and setting up military</text>
  <text start="935.34" dur="6.48">targets spying on all the locals making</text>
  <text start="938.64" dur="5.07">sure China and Russia aren&amp;#39;t in these</text>
  <text start="941.82" dur="5.28">areas and we can see at this point in</text>
  <text start="943.71" dur="5.93">time that everything is starting to heat</text>
  <text start="947.1" dur="5.43">up right now we see throughout the globe</text>
  <text start="949.64" dur="5.59">where aid is coming into Ukraine now</text>
  <text start="952.53" dur="6.42">military aid which is non-lethal and</text>
  <text start="955.23" dur="6.66">lethal weapons we see in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="958.95" dur="5.85">things are complete a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="961.89" dur="5.34">there and we see out in the Pacific and</text>
  <text start="964.8" dur="5.49">Africa everything is start</text>
  <text start="967.23" dur="6.81">to heat up why because the economy is</text>
  <text start="970.29" dur="6.12">starting to disintegrate the economy</text>
  <text start="974.04" dur="4.16">cannot be sustained the United States</text>
  <text start="976.41" dur="4.41">government central bankers know this</text>
  <text start="978.2" dur="5.56">everything has been done in preparation</text>
  <text start="980.82" dur="6.03">for war they&amp;#39;ve been moving military</text>
