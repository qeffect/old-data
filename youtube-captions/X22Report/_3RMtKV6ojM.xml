  <text start="55.809" dur="5.43">wake up and they&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="58.019" dur="5.47">everything about the economy is not what</text>
  <text start="61.239" dur="6.531">the central bank&amp;#39;s the government&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="63.489" dur="6.751">telling them it is out in the eurozone</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="5.56">we&amp;#39;re continually seeing consumer</text>
  <text start="70.24" dur="5.549">confidence drop it was expected to be at</text>
  <text start="73.33" dur="5.58">a negative seven point seven but it came</text>
  <text start="75.789" dur="5.881">in as a negative 8.5 and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="78.91" dur="3.84">happening is that people are starting to</text>
  <text start="81.67" dur="2.91">realize even though the government</text>
  <text start="82.75" dur="4.259">continually tells them that unemployment</text>
  <text start="84.58" dur="5.19">is getting better GDP is going to be</text>
  <text start="87.009" dur="4.521">incredible it&amp;#39;s going to be 3.5 and they</text>
  <text start="89.77" dur="5.7">keep using all these different</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="8.55">statistical figures but the reality is</text>
  <text start="95.47" dur="11.25">is that people who are on the streets</text>
  <text start="100.08" dur="9.039">people who are working everyday people</text>
  <text start="106.72" dur="4.89">who are going out to purchase every day</text>
  <text start="109.119" dur="6.541">people who are going to look to purchase</text>
  <text start="111.61" dur="7.86">a home every day realize something is</text>
  <text start="115.66" dur="5.79">happening in the economy why because</text>
  <text start="119.47" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re realizing that their job is not</text>
  <text start="121.45" dur="4.71">secure they&amp;#39;re realizing they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="124.78" dur="4.74">the purchasing power they once had</text>
  <text start="126.16" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re realizing that maybe this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="129.52" dur="5.579">a good time to purchase a home many</text>
  <text start="132.13" dur="5.52">people can&amp;#39;t purchase a home because</text>
  <text start="135.099" dur="5.25">they don&amp;#39;t have the extra funding many</text>
  <text start="137.65" dur="7.08">people have been laid off and never</text>
  <text start="140.349" dur="7.591">recovered I never were able to save that</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="5.28">money and those people that have been</text>
  <text start="147.94" dur="4.47">laid off are working one two three</text>
  <text start="150.01" dur="7.02">part-time jobs and this is why you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="152.41" dur="7.29">see the purchasing and retail and the US</text>
  <text start="157.03" dur="6.3">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="159.7" dur="6.48">going to do whatever they can to</text>
  <text start="163.33" dur="7.16">keep this illusion that we&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="166.18" dur="8.93">right now alive until the very end</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="10.81">because it is an illusion it&amp;#39;s not real</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="10.24">the economy is completely created by the</text>
  <text start="181.3" dur="6.6">central bank they can control a lot of</text>
  <text start="185.35" dur="5.34">it but not all of it it&amp;#39;s very hard to</text>
  <text start="187.9" dur="4.62">control all the stores closing it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="190.69" dur="4.44">hard to control the people who are laid</text>
  <text start="192.52" dur="6.39">off they can&amp;#39;t find jobs it&amp;#39;s very hard</text>
  <text start="195.13" dur="6.93">to control the housing market completely</text>
  <text start="198.91" dur="6.33">and they know this but all they have to</text>
  <text start="202.06" dur="5.43">do is control the statistics end of it</text>
  <text start="205.24" dur="4.8">and have the corporate media blurt that</text>
  <text start="207.49" dur="4.62">out and people will believe and their</text>
  <text start="210.04" dur="4.169">agenda right now is to keep this</text>
  <text start="212.11" dur="5.88">illusion alive until the very end and</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="5.221">even during the coming collapse because</text>
  <text start="217.99" dur="4.08">you have to remember they understand</text>
  <text start="219.43" dur="6.66">that this system is dead they want to</text>
  <text start="222.07" dur="5.91">start a new system and of course the</text>
  <text start="226.09" dur="4.86">central banks have plans for this so</text>
  <text start="227.98" dur="5.28">they need a transition period and this</text>
  <text start="230.95" dur="5.46">is we&amp;#39;re at right now this is a</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="4.86">transition period now they just can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="236.41" dur="3.84">to the wall flip the switch and say okay</text>
  <text start="238.12" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re done with the old system let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="6.62">to the new system it just wouldn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="242.56" dur="7.11">so what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="6.42">keeping all the statistical information</text>
  <text start="249.67" dur="6.749">out there in the most positive light</text>
  <text start="253.29" dur="6.729">until they can get that transition</text>
  <text start="256.419" dur="4.831">period started now the question</text>
  <text start="260.019" dur="2.971">everyone&amp;#39;s saying well what do you mean</text>
  <text start="261.25" dur="5.61">by transition period what what are you</text>
  <text start="262.99" dur="6.27">talking about think about back in the</text>
  <text start="266.86" dur="3.54">1970s 1971 when we&amp;#39;re coming off the</text>
  <text start="269.26" dur="4.26">gold standard when we were just starting</text>
  <text start="270.4" dur="7.23">this Fiat system think about what</text>
  <text start="273.52" dur="8.94">happened there we didn&amp;#39;t have an oil</text>
  <text start="277.63" dur="7.53">crisis we had a problem with our</text>
  <text start="282.46" dur="5.519">monetary system where the central bank</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="6.03">took us off the gold standard and they</text>
  <text start="287.979" dur="5.671">were in the middle of putting us on a</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="4.5">new system the petro dollar system now</text>
  <text start="293.65" dur="3.56">this is the in the beginning stages of a</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="4.23">Fiat system</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="7.93">and once you do this the dollar is</text>
  <text start="299.92" dur="8">devalued quite a bit but the debt was</text>
  <text start="305.14" dur="7.92">quite low at that time because it was</text>
  <text start="307.92" dur="6.67">held steady by the gold standard now</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="4.29">this is in the beginning stages so what</text>
  <text start="314.59" dur="4.98">happens in the beginning stages well we</text>
  <text start="317.35" dur="3.78">see the devaluation the central bank</text>
  <text start="319.57" dur="3.18">stepped in they were able to raise</text>
  <text start="321.13" dur="4.89">interest rates to soak up all those</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="6.36">extra dollars the central bank was</text>
  <text start="326.02" dur="7.02">making deals in the Middle East to place</text>
  <text start="329.11" dur="5.84">the dollar on their oil reserves and</text>
  <text start="333.04" dur="4.56">have other countries use the dollar</text>
  <text start="334.95" dur="7.51">which would then send inflation overseas</text>
  <text start="337.6" dur="6.87">and everything was readjusted people</text>
  <text start="342.46" dur="4.38">bought houses at 25,000 they were read</text>
  <text start="344.47" dur="4.77">justed 250 they went to a hundred and it</text>
  <text start="346.84" dur="4.61">wasn&amp;#39;t because they were appreciating it</text>
  <text start="349.24" dur="7.47">was because the value of the dollar was</text>
  <text start="351.45" dur="8.05">devalue quite a bit now that was in the</text>
  <text start="356.71" dur="4.35">beginning part of this system that we</text>
  <text start="359.5" dur="3.6">just went on now a lot of people had no</text>
  <text start="361.06" dur="5.28">work during the 70&amp;#39;s they couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="363.1" dur="6.75">jobs people couldn&amp;#39;t fill up their cars</text>
  <text start="366.34" dur="6.74">people were in tough situations other</text>
  <text start="369.85" dur="7.05">people were okay it was a mixed bag but</text>
  <text start="373.08" dur="5.05">right now we&amp;#39;re at the end stage of this</text>
  <text start="376.9" dur="3.51">and we&amp;#39;re going to be going through this</text>
  <text start="378.13" dur="6.81">transition once again but we have a huge</text>
  <text start="380.41" dur="7.98">amount of debt we have zero or negative</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="7.08">interest rates right now we have a</text>
  <text start="388.39" dur="7.92">situation where the rest of the world is</text>
  <text start="392.02" dur="8.64">looking at the United States saying the</text>
  <text start="396.31" dur="8.97">Full Faith of the US government behind</text>
  <text start="400.66" dur="8.25">the dollar no longer exists the</text>
  <text start="405.28" dur="9.18">petrodollar that all the countries have</text>
  <text start="408.91" dur="7.68">been using is disappearing the United</text>
  <text start="414.46" dur="4.53">States is losing control and this is</text>
  <text start="416.59" dur="9.6">what we see happening right now so this</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="9.05">transition period is happening because</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="4.22">they need</text>
  <text start="428.04" dur="6.63">to convert everything into the new</text>
  <text start="430.41" dur="7.41">system they need to cover it up they</text>
  <text start="434.67" dur="5.82">need to say ah the reason for all of</text>
  <text start="437.82" dur="5.46">this is because of this country this</text>
  <text start="440.49" dur="6.03">group and this is why this is happening</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="5.04">right now and once this transition</text>
  <text start="446.52" dur="4.23">period most likely going to be war is</text>
  <text start="448.32" dur="6.39">over they will then restart the entire</text>
  <text start="450.75" dur="5.88">system but during this period they need</text>
  <text start="454.71" dur="6.72">to make it look like everything is fine</text>
  <text start="456.63" dur="7.14">and when we look at precious metals for</text>
  <text start="461.43" dur="6.33">instance they can have precious metals</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="7.38">increase in price they just can&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="7.14">have to suppress it if you notice today</text>
  <text start="471.15" dur="6.57">all of a sudden out of the blue gold was</text>
  <text start="474.9" dur="5.76">slammed down and when we look closely at</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="6.66">this we see there were 10,000 contracts</text>
  <text start="480.66" dur="6.69">dumped in one minute this is very normal</text>
  <text start="484.38" dur="7.62">isn&amp;#39;t it which brought the gold price</text>
  <text start="487.35" dur="7.83">down and we can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="492" dur="7.26">going to continually do this to convince</text>
  <text start="495.18" dur="7.23">everyone that the economy is fine this</text>
  <text start="499.26" dur="5.46">is part of their agenda but we have to</text>
  <text start="502.41" dur="5.07">remember it they can&amp;#39;t do it for</text>
  <text start="504.72" dur="4.56">everything yes they can pick out certain</text>
  <text start="507.48" dur="3.69">locations for the housing market and</text>
  <text start="509.28" dur="5.28">make everyone believe that the housing</text>
  <text start="511.17" dur="5.249">market is doing very very well but they</text>
  <text start="514.56" dur="5.13">can do this with a lot of the builders</text>
  <text start="516.419" dur="6.391">with new homes but in many of the areas</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="5.88">they are declining rapidly and we see</text>
  <text start="522.81" dur="5.22">that existing home sales for july that</text>
  <text start="525.57" dur="5.67">missed expectations dropping one by one</text>
  <text start="528.03" dur="5.37">point six four percent and when we look</text>
  <text start="531.24" dur="4.47">at this we can see that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="533.4" dur="4.74">problem here because when we look at</text>
  <text start="535.71" dur="4.5">mortgage apps we see their declining</text>
  <text start="538.14" dur="4.74">they have dropped at the same time</text>
  <text start="540.21" dur="5.79">mortgage applications are dropping we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="542.88" dur="5.94">seen existing home sales and new home</text>
  <text start="546" dur="6.3">sales rise now we&amp;#39;ve seen new home sales</text>
  <text start="548.82" dur="8.07">rise a lot more than existing because</text>
  <text start="552.3" dur="6.42">new homes are easier to manipulate than</text>
  <text start="556.89" dur="3">the existing because new homes they can</text>
  <text start="558.72" dur="2.88">go to the builders they can have free</text>
  <text start="559.89" dur="4.08">money they can have hedge funds</text>
  <text start="561.6" dur="4.169">come in you know speculate saying okay</text>
  <text start="563.97" dur="3.989">we&amp;#39;re going to purchase this home now</text>
  <text start="565.769" dur="4.981">sale might not even go through but they</text>
  <text start="567.959" dur="5.331">can do this but we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="570.75" dur="6.66">discrepancy throughout all of this</text>
  <text start="573.29" dur="6.909">because the everyday American they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.41" dur="6.63">not in the market mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="580.199" dur="7.26">are declining I mean we have proof from</text>
  <text start="584.04" dur="5.34">credit Swiss saying when they surveyed</text>
  <text start="587.459" dur="8.221">their real estate agents that buyer</text>
  <text start="589.38" dur="10.47">traffic is disappearing it&amp;#39;s declining</text>
  <text start="595.68" dur="7.2">rapidly and I see to my area where there</text>
  <text start="599.85" dur="7.859">is many homes for sale but no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="602.88" dur="9.149">coming to look at them and all of this</text>
  <text start="607.709" dur="10.531">that we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="612.029" dur="9.961">collapse it is happening right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.24" dur="6.39">happening in many areas it might not be</text>
  <text start="621.99" dur="5.149">with the stock market I mean think about</text>
  <text start="624.63" dur="5.61">it the stock market go to 40,000 points</text>
  <text start="627.139" dur="6.101">50,000 points but if you have a hundred</text>
  <text start="630.24" dur="5.699">and ninety million or 210 million or 300</text>
  <text start="633.24" dur="6.209">million people out of work if you have</text>
  <text start="635.939" dur="8.181">strip malls that are vacant moles that</text>
  <text start="639.449" dur="8.521">are vacant people not shopping in retail</text>
  <text start="644.12" dur="6.43">GDP entering the negative area this is</text>
  <text start="647.97" dur="6.179">the stock market really tell us anything</text>
  <text start="650.55" dur="5.94">if corporate earnings are continually</text>
  <text start="654.149" dur="4.11">dropping and corporate sales are</text>
  <text start="656.49" dur="4.32">dropping and the stock market is still</text>
  <text start="658.259" dur="6.241">rising does it really say that the</text>
  <text start="660.81" dur="7.1">economy is okay does it really mean</text>
  <text start="664.5" dur="9.569">anything at this point no it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="667.91" dur="10.65">it&amp;#39;s an illusion the whole thing is one</text>
  <text start="674.069" dur="7.13">gigantic illusion that we&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="678.56" dur="5.86">yes can the central bank continually</text>
  <text start="681.199" dur="6.281">create currency loan it to the</text>
  <text start="684.42" dur="4.919">government can they keep the banks</text>
  <text start="687.48" dur="4.5">afloat can they keep the stock market</text>
  <text start="689.339" dur="5.31">going can they suppress gold yeah they</text>
  <text start="691.98" dur="3.66">can keep doing this but as more and more</text>
  <text start="694.649" dur="2.701">people lose their job</text>
  <text start="695.64" dur="5.19">as more and more stores closed as more</text>
  <text start="697.35" dur="6.54">and more of this continually happens the</text>
  <text start="700.83" dur="5.58">illusion starts to disappear because</text>
  <text start="703.89" dur="5.43">none of the people believe it anymore</text>
  <text start="706.41" dur="4.98">and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening right now it</text>
  <text start="709.32" dur="3.63">starts off very small where people say I</text>
  <text start="711.39" dur="5.19">don&amp;#39;t know if the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="712.95" dur="6.78">are really correct because something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="716.58" dur="4.95">wrong I got laid off you know 23 months</text>
  <text start="719.73" dur="5.73">ago I&amp;#39;ve been putting out my resume and</text>
  <text start="721.53" dur="6.6">I just can&amp;#39;t find that job or I look and</text>
  <text start="725.46" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s not there&amp;#39;s no job openings</text>
  <text start="728.13" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s no place to send my resume I go</text>
  <text start="730.56" dur="4.55">to headhunters they tell me there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="732.6" dur="6.41">lot of jobs but they never contact me</text>
  <text start="735.11" dur="8.5">and it starts all very small and then it</text>
  <text start="739.01" dur="8.08">grows and people become aware the</text>
  <text start="743.61" dur="6.99">illusion the terror rates falls to the</text>
  <text start="747.09" dur="7.26">side and people understand what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="750.6" dur="6.84">on and this is the race that the central</text>
  <text start="754.35" dur="7.44">bank is in because they can&amp;#39;t let the</text>
  <text start="757.44" dur="8.34">illusion disappear before they&amp;#39;re ready</text>
  <text start="761.79" dur="5.55">to bring the system down and this is</text>
