  <text start="43.51" dur="5.97">entire recovery is an illusion let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="47.32" dur="5.16">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="49.48" dur="5.91">news now we understand that the central</text>
  <text start="52.48" dur="4.829">banks needed to create a bubble and they</text>
  <text start="55.39" dur="5.309">created many different types of bubbles</text>
  <text start="57.309" dur="5.88">in the economy I mean we see the stock</text>
  <text start="60.699" dur="4.261">market bubble we see the bond bubble we</text>
  <text start="63.189" dur="3.961">see the derivative bubble the student</text>

  <text start="67.15" dur="5.039">housing bubble you name it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="69.939" dur="4.081">trying to create as many bubbles as they</text>
  <text start="72.189" dur="6.511">possibly can because they realize at</text>
  <text start="74.02" dur="7.29">this point the everyday person in each</text>
  <text start="78.7" dur="6.57">one of the countries they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="81.31" dur="5.94">means to go out and to do what they want</text>
  <text start="85.27" dur="4.05">them to do most of the people are</text>
  <text start="87.25" dur="5.21">unemployed most of the people are</text>
  <text start="89.32" dur="6.33">working part-time many of the people</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="6.37">don&amp;#39;t have funds they were hit back in</text>
  <text start="95.65" dur="5.19">2008 never recovered so they created</text>
  <text start="98.83" dur="5.37">these bubbles and what do they do well a</text>
  <text start="100.84" dur="5.58">lot of foreign oligarchs a lot of hedge</text>
  <text start="104.2" dur="5.76">funds investment companies the central</text>
  <text start="106.42" dur="6">banks created free money and a lot of</text>
  <text start="109.96" dur="5.55">this money is being put into real estate</text>
  <text start="112.42" dur="6.48">and what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="115.51" dur="6.99">parking the funds and they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="118.9" dur="7.62">these incredible bubbles driving prices</text>
  <text start="122.5" dur="6.869">up to show that sea real estate is back</text>
  <text start="126.52" dur="6.049">on track the problem is the people of</text>
  <text start="129.369" dur="7.351">the country they&amp;#39;re not the ones</text>
  <text start="132.569" dur="9.39">creating this demand because there is no</text>
  <text start="136.72" dur="7.53">demand and we see out in Canada out in</text>
  <text start="141.959" dur="2.95">many different parts like Vancouver in</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="3.09">Toronto</text>
  <text start="144.909" dur="5.311">yes housing prices have soared because</text>
  <text start="147.34" dur="7.709">of all of this hot cash coming into</text>
  <text start="150.22" dur="7.079">Canada and the Bank of Nova Scotia they</text>
  <text start="155.049" dur="4.231">decided to ease off on mortgage lending</text>
  <text start="157.299" dur="4.231">in these two areas because the prices</text>
  <text start="159.28" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re skyrocketing they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="161.53" dur="4.44">understand why because they see that</text>
  <text start="164.02" dur="4.71">people coming into the banks they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="6.12">taking out mortgages so something</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="4.89">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense here because when</text>
  <text start="172.09" dur="3.9">they look at the household incomes and</text>
  <text start="173.62" dur="3.99">they look at housing prices they see</text>
  <text start="175.99" dur="4.16">people are in a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="177.61" dur="5.16">people are not making the incomes and</text>
  <text start="180.15" dur="7.03">they see a lot of this is being driven</text>
  <text start="182.77" dur="7.14">by outside sources so the OECD they</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="4.68">assess the situation and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="189.91" dur="4.05">mmm we might have a problem here we</text>
  <text start="191.86" dur="5.3">could see a disorderly housing market</text>
  <text start="193.96" dur="5.61">correction in Toronto and Vancouver and</text>
  <text start="197.16" dur="4.93">this is a very big threat to Canada&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.57" dur="4.68">economy well we realize at this point in</text>
  <text start="202.09" dur="4.29">many other areas the housing market is</text>
  <text start="204.25" dur="5.42">starting to shake rattle and roll and</text>
  <text start="206.38" dur="8.55">fall apart and they said this would</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="9.4">completely destroy the financial</text>
  <text start="214.93" dur="5.54">stability of Canada a top bureaucrat</text>
  <text start="219.07" dur="5.13">overseeing the real estate sector</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="6.6">Carolyn Rodgers admits she did not</text>
  <text start="224.2" dur="6.9">realize how wildly speculative</text>
  <text start="227.07" dur="5.56">Vancouver&amp;#39;s market had become so we can</text>
  <text start="231.1" dur="3.27">see at this point things are really</text>
  <text start="232.63" dur="4.62">starting to heat up and we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="234.37" dur="4.86">seeing in the Alberta area that the rate</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="4.83">of insolvencies has jumped forty three</text>
  <text start="239.23" dur="4.83">point five percent in the past year and</text>
  <text start="242.08" dur="4.29">this is coming from the numbers from the</text>
  <text start="244.06" dur="4.83">federal office of the superintendent of</text>
  <text start="246.37" dur="4.08">bankruptcy in Canada and we see</text>
  <text start="248.89" dur="5.61">Edmonton&amp;#39;s is fifty three point three</text>
  <text start="250.45" dur="6.57">percent of insolvencies Calgary is at</text>
  <text start="254.5" dur="4.14">eighteen point three percent and we can</text>
  <text start="257.02" dur="5.4">see right now many of the countries</text>
  <text start="258.64" dur="6.09">around the world they are feeling the</text>
  <text start="262.42" dur="4.2">pressure right now the people of these</text>
  <text start="264.73" dur="2.91">countries are feeling the pressure the</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="3.54">governments are doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="267.64" dur="4.44">possibly can to cover up what is really</text>
  <text start="270.16" dur="4.8">happening and they&amp;#39;re continually doing</text>
  <text start="272.08" dur="5.49">this here in the United States we see</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="5.22">that they manipulate all statistics they</text>
  <text start="277.57" dur="5.43">have to because we are not in a recovery</text>
  <text start="280.18" dur="5.489">we were never in a recovery all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283" dur="4.8">doing is creating this gigantic illusion</text>
  <text start="285.669" dur="5.101">by keeping people in the dark of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="4.29">really going on we see a DP they came</text>
  <text start="290.77" dur="2.37">out with their numbers and they printed</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="3.329">out about a hundred and seventy three</text>
  <text start="293.14" dur="4.05">thousand for May this is still the</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="4.471">second lowest print</text>
  <text start="297.19" dur="6.81">last September as manufacturing the</text>
  <text start="299.89" dur="4.71">service sector completely implodes on</text>
  <text start="304" dur="4.7">itself</text>
  <text start="304.6" dur="6.84">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="308.7" dur="4.24">the job market really doesn&amp;#39;t look that</text>
  <text start="311.44" dur="3.06">good but what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.94" dur="2.97">manipulating the information trying to</text>
  <text start="314.5" dur="4.74">make it look a lot better than it really</text>
  <text start="315.91" dur="4.7">is and the US government is going to put</text>
  <text start="319.24" dur="3.6">out their unemployment numbers tomorrow</text>
  <text start="320.61" dur="4.54">but we see the initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="322.84" dur="4.71">they printed about two hundred sixty two</text>
  <text start="325.15" dur="4.35">hundred sixty seven thousand and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="327.55" dur="3.96">little bit better than they expected but</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s very odd is that we have more and</text>
  <text start="331.51" dur="4.62">more layoffs and the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="4.2">claims don&amp;#39;t go anywhere but we see the</text>
  <text start="336.13" dur="5.76">is em manufacturing and the is em</text>
  <text start="338.35" dur="5.97">service employment data suggests a very</text>
  <text start="341.89" dur="4.44">different picture because we know that</text>
  <text start="344.32" dur="4.79">manufacturing is losing jobs and we know</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="6.2">that the service sector is losing jobs</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="6.55">so who is getting jobs at this point</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="6.16">something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense someone is</text>
  <text start="355.66" dur="5.99">lying and I think we know who it is</text>
  <text start="358.69" dur="7.05">we CISM new york&amp;#39;s purchasing managers</text>
  <text start="361.65" dur="6.34">that survey collapsed it went from fifty</text>
  <text start="365.74" dur="5.82">seven to thirty seven point to the</text>
  <text start="367.99" dur="6.48">lowest since april 2009 this is the</text>
  <text start="371.56" dur="6.48">biggest monthly drop since May of 2007</text>
  <text start="374.47" dur="6.78">the Baltic Dry Index that is falling it</text>
  <text start="378.04" dur="5.76">is down to 606 it dropped six points now</text>
  <text start="381.25" dur="5.19">something very interesting and we talked</text>
  <text start="383.8" dur="5.79">about this in past reports where the</text>
  <text start="386.44" dur="4.95">smart money is leaving the stock market</text>
  <text start="389.59" dur="3.36">now of course the United States</text>
  <text start="391.39" dur="4.29">government central bankers the corporate</text>
  <text start="392.95" dur="5.52">media all the financial pundits are out</text>
  <text start="395.68" dur="6.42">there trying to convince you that the</text>
  <text start="398.47" dur="6.33">market is doing very well and they want</text>
  <text start="402.1" dur="4.23">you to believe that corporations are</text>
  <text start="404.8" dur="2.6">doing well and there&amp;#39;s nothing to worry</text>
  <text start="406.33" dur="4.71">about</text>
  <text start="407.4" dur="5.83">but if you really look at it stocks have</text>
  <text start="411.04" dur="4.59">gone nowhere since the end of March if</text>
  <text start="413.23" dur="5.7">you want to include the collapse at the</text>
  <text start="415.63" dur="6.21">beginning of the year and the massive</text>
  <text start="418.93" dur="4.47">short covering rally you could make an</text>
  <text start="421.84" dur="5.91">argument that stocks have gone nowhere</text>
  <text start="423.4" dur="7.68">since December of 2015 now if this is a</text>
  <text start="427.75" dur="5.419">start of a new bull market</text>
  <text start="431.08" dur="5.369">why have fun ant Financial Institutions</text>
  <text start="433.169" dur="5.131">been dumping stocks for 18 weeks</text>
  <text start="436.449" dur="6.24">straight</text>
  <text start="438.3" dur="8.889">hedge funds financial institutions high</text>
  <text start="442.689" dur="7.831">net worth clients are selling no one in</text>
  <text start="447.189" dur="8.581">the smart money category is buying the</text>
  <text start="450.52" dur="7.56">rally another question if this is the</text>
  <text start="455.77" dur="7.799">start of another bull market why are</text>
  <text start="458.08" dur="8.579">corporate profits collapsing this is not</text>
  <text start="463.569" dur="7.53">a bull market this is a manipulation of</text>
  <text start="466.659" dur="5.85">the markets to make you believe that we</text>
  <text start="471.099" dur="4.171">are in a bull market and when you really</text>
  <text start="472.509" dur="5.671">look at the stock market it reminds us</text>
  <text start="475.27" dur="5.13">of 2008 where we were in that August</text>
  <text start="478.18" dur="3.479">timeframe where the stock market was</text>
  <text start="480.4" dur="5.19">bouncing up and down going absolutely</text>
  <text start="481.659" dur="8.461">nowhere and if you go back to 1929 it</text>
  <text start="485.59" dur="10.259">looks exactly the same so we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="490.12" dur="7.32">the same thing but here in 2016 and</text>
  <text start="495.849" dur="4.741">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="497.44" dur="6.689">everyday American well they can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="500.59" dur="6.15">to live and over the past eight years we</text>
  <text start="504.129" dur="4.44">know Obama has been out there screaming</text>
  <text start="506.74" dur="4.2">and yelling that this is the recovery</text>
  <text start="508.569" dur="4.26">everything is fine but really what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="510.94" dur="4.079">been happening is that the central</text>
  <text start="512.829" dur="5.34">bankers the elite they&amp;#39;ve been strip</text>
  <text start="515.019" dur="5.791">mining the wealth from the US and many</text>
  <text start="518.169" dur="5.131">other countries around the world fully</text>
  <text start="520.81" dur="3.029">employed Americans well guess what</text>
  <text start="523.3" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="523.839" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;ve been borrowing from payday</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="5.58">lenders in order to pay for normal</text>
  <text start="528.61" dur="7.729">everyday living expenses and if you look</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="7.92">at wages and income it has been falling</text>
  <text start="536.339" dur="7.11">year after year making it harder and</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="7.14">harder for people to get by and</text>
  <text start="543.449" dur="6.431">companies are realizing that well wait a</text>
  <text start="546.55" dur="7.52">minute most of these people can&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="549.88" dur="8.1">it so instead of boosting their wages</text>
  <text start="554.07" dur="8.04">they are offering them low-interest</text>
  <text start="557.98" dur="6.58">loans now let&amp;#39;s think back in history</text>
  <text start="562.11" dur="5.09">remember when</text>
  <text start="564.56" dur="6.6">you were working that us but people were</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="8.04">working in maybe some type of factory or</text>
  <text start="571.16" dur="6.96">for a person and they took out a loan</text>
  <text start="575.24" dur="5.55">with that person well they were enslaved</text>
  <text start="578.12" dur="6.93">to that person until the loan was paid</text>
  <text start="580.79" dur="10.98">back aren&amp;#39;t we going down the same path</text>
  <text start="585.05" dur="8.64">here and this is what&amp;#39;s happening all</text>
  <text start="591.77" dur="5.759">around the country right now people are</text>
  <text start="593.69" dur="7.76">having a very difficult time making it</text>
  <text start="597.529" dur="7.231">through and corporations now have them</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="5.97">by not boosting their wages but by</text>
  <text start="604.76" dur="7.35">giving them loans they aren&amp;#39;t enslaved</text>
  <text start="607.42" dur="7.359">to these companies there are 12 million</text>
  <text start="612.11" dur="8.13">Americans who use payday loans each year</text>
  <text start="614.779" dur="9.271">and this is spreading it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="620.24" dur="7.11">as time goes on now we know the collapse</text>
  <text start="624.05" dur="5.46">is getting closer when Congress comes</text>
  <text start="627.35" dur="6.15">out just a few days ago and brings out a</text>
  <text start="629.51" dur="7.29">chart 5 to 76 and this bill that they</text>
  <text start="633.5" dur="6.14">introduced states the following no</text>
  <text start="636.8" dur="6.84">bailouts for State Territory and local</text>
  <text start="639.64" dur="6.04">governments Act the new bill prohibits</text>
  <text start="643.64" dur="4.8">any federal agency from funding any</text>
  <text start="645.68" dur="4.53">bankrupt city state or territory the</text>
  <text start="648.44" dur="4.14">bill also prohibits the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="650.21" dur="5.4">from financially assisting state and</text>
  <text start="652.58" dur="5.55">local governments well that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="655.61" dur="4.95">interesting because we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="658.13" dur="4.23">happening in Puerto Rico and this is</text>
  <text start="660.56" dur="5.49">just the beginning because they realize</text>
  <text start="662.36" dur="7.17">what&amp;#39;s coming this collapse but the</text>
  <text start="666.05" dur="5.97">president is out there and he is saying</text>
  <text start="669.53" dur="7.08">that the economy is better off now than</text>
  <text start="672.02" dur="6.74">when I started well when we look at the</text>
  <text start="676.61" dur="6.41">real information like student loans</text>
  <text start="678.76" dur="7.84">skyrocketing gigantic bubble food stamps</text>

  <text start="690.67" dur="4.96">skyrocketing health care costs let&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="694.1" dur="4.32">even talk about that because we know</text>
  <text start="695.63" dur="5.82">those premiums and the benefit</text>
  <text start="698.42" dur="5.1">are non-existent and the premiums are</text>

  <text start="729.32" dur="5.85">he really means is that he&amp;#39;s created</text>
  <text start="732.74" dur="3.96">these bubbles and the illusion is trying</text>
  <text start="735.17" dur="3.84">to convince everyone that we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="736.7" dur="5.1">better now when a US government official</text>
