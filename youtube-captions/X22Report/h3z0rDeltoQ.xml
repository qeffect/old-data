  <text start="117.439" dur="6.241">cash by Sunday and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="120.649" dur="6.601">interesting about this is that the</text>
  <text start="123.68" dur="6.689">people of Greece are saying thank God</text>
  <text start="127.25" dur="4.92">they took out the cash because they</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="5.251">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to pay for anything in</text>
  <text start="132.17" dur="5.46">any other way and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="135.62" dur="6.09">wholesalers can&amp;#39;t pay for supplies right</text>
  <text start="137.63" dur="7.25">now businesses which are import raw</text>
  <text start="141.71" dur="5.67">materials have been hardest hit and</text>
  <text start="144.88" dur="4.12">because of these capital controls it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.38" dur="3.66">making it very very difficult to go</text>
  <text start="149" dur="3.51">around and purchasing a lot of store</text>
  <text start="151.04" dur="3.63">owners are saying there&amp;#39;s nothing going</text>
  <text start="152.51" dur="4.91">on one right now a lot of people already</text>
  <text start="154.67" dur="5.01">raided the stores shelves are empty and</text>
  <text start="157.42" dur="3.88">having the physical cash having the</text>
  <text start="159.68" dur="4.77">physical gold having the physical silver</text>
  <text start="161.3" dur="6.269">is a really</text>
  <text start="164.45" dur="5.539">art thing to have on hand when the</text>
  <text start="167.569" dur="6.901">central bankers decide to cut off your</text>
  <text start="169.989" dur="6.071">electronic currency and right now we are</text>
  <text start="174.47" dur="5.81">definitely seeing this where people are</text>
  <text start="176.06" dur="7.259">saying okay cash is king right now</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="6.37">precious metals is something that</text>
  <text start="183.319" dur="5.971">everyone should also have because once</text>
  <text start="186.65" dur="4.68">cash is devalued and it becomes</text>
  <text start="189.29" dur="6.87">worthless you have to move on to the</text>
  <text start="191.33" dur="7.83">next physical type of currency and we</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="6.96">see out in Greece this has been proven</text>
  <text start="199.16" dur="9.12">and we see right now in Greece that</text>
  <text start="203.12" dur="8.58">PayPal has been shut down because of the</text>
  <text start="208.28" dur="4.83">capital controls paypal wallet from</text>
  <text start="211.7" dur="3.69">greek bank accounts as well as</text>
  <text start="213.11" dur="4.68">cross-border transactions funded by any</text>
  <text start="215.39" dur="5.849">cards or bank accounts are currently not</text>
  <text start="217.79" dur="9.12">available everything is frozen it is</text>
  <text start="221.239" dur="7.83">very very difficult to survive right now</text>
  <text start="226.91" dur="6.6">in greece unless you had some type of</text>
  <text start="229.069" dur="8.521">physical or something to barter and we</text>
  <text start="233.51" dur="6.36">are seeing out of the IMF and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="237.59" dur="5.31">saying this for quite a while but</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="5.33">they&amp;#39;ve come out with this analysis and</text>
  <text start="242.9" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="7.539">okay look we&amp;#39;ve come out with this new</text>
  <text start="248.54" dur="6.96">report and the entire idea of lending</text>
  <text start="252.739" dur="6.78">more and more money and raising taxes</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="7.74">only reduces shrinks collapses the</text>
  <text start="259.519" dur="6.331">economy it doesn&amp;#39;t help all these</text>
  <text start="263.24" dur="5.73">policies ever do is promote bondholders</text>
  <text start="265.85" dur="5.22">at the expense of the population the new</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="4.949">numbers now available reflect that the</text>
  <text start="271.07" dur="5.25">total rescue program from Greece for</text>
  <text start="273.919" dur="7.351">Greece has failed in the most</text>
  <text start="276.32" dur="10.219">spectacular manner so we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="281.27" dur="8.34">now more and more dead on a country</text>
  <text start="286.539" dur="8.351">imposing austerity propping up the</text>
  <text start="289.61" dur="8.67">bankers does nothing except make the</text>
  <text start="294.89" dur="7.119">situation much much</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="6.46">that&amp;#39;s it we didn&amp;#39;t need them to come</text>
  <text start="302.009" dur="5.071">out with this analysis we can see if</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="8.179">we&amp;#39;re with our own eyes we could see</text>
  <text start="307.08" dur="11.929">that adding debt imposing austerity</text>
  <text start="312.919" dur="11.401">putting people out of work does not help</text>
  <text start="319.009" dur="8.081">period it makes it worse for the country</text>
  <text start="324.32" dur="4.33">tsipras is saying the IMF report was</text>
  <text start="327.09" dur="3.69">never presented to us because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="328.65" dur="4.79">want you to have that they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="330.78" dur="8.97">you to know receiving more and more debt</text>
  <text start="333.44" dur="9.16">destroys your country and when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.75" dur="4.74">looking at this tsipras is saying okay</text>
  <text start="342.6" dur="5.67">what&amp;#39;s going on here this just proves</text>
  <text start="344.49" dur="7.32">our case you need to vote no on sunday&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="8.519">referendum and he&amp;#39;s cold on his people</text>
  <text start="351.81" dur="8.49">to remain united he says I call on you</text>
  <text start="356.789" dur="6.471">to vote no to ultimatums to imitate to</text>
  <text start="360.3" dur="5.85">intimidation to the fear campaign</text>
  <text start="363.26" dur="5.26">however I also call on you to say no to</text>
  <text start="366.15" dur="4.829">division he said no to those who are</text>
  <text start="368.52" dur="4.16">trying to spread panic and prevent you</text>
  <text start="370.979" dur="5.18">from deciding with composure and</text>
  <text start="372.68" dur="7.83">responsibility for your own future I</text>
  <text start="376.159" dur="8.021">call on you to the side for dignity and</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="4.99">democracy and of course as we know the</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="3.69">central bankers are out there and</text>
  <text start="385.5" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="6.6">to convince the world that Greece is</text>
  <text start="392.25" dur="4.02">going to vote yes now of course they can</text>
  <text start="394.47" dur="5.699">come in they can manipulate the elect</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="6.45">the the referendum and they can make it</text>
  <text start="400.169" dur="4.921">come out in their favor we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="402.72" dur="6.6">done many many times this is not that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.09" dur="5.91">any this is not new so we can see at</text>
  <text start="409.32" dur="4.05">this point in time and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="411" dur="5.31">have to watch this and see what happens</text>
  <text start="413.37" dur="4.859">as we get closer I see the poll numbers</text>
  <text start="416.31" dur="3.389">are saying oh it&amp;#39;s neck-and-neck we</text>
  <text start="418.229" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going to happen of</text>
  <text start="419.699" dur="4.44">course this is propaganda this is what</text>
  <text start="422.639" dur="3.691">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everyone of</text>
  <text start="424.139" dur="4.261">and we see other countries are</text>
  <text start="426.33" dur="5.16">supporting Greece in the no vote France</text>
  <text start="428.4" dur="3.3">by the thousands they&amp;#39;ve been protesting</text>
  <text start="431.49" dur="1.89">or</text>
  <text start="431.7" dur="3.84">urging Greeks to vote no in Sunday&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.38" dur="4.76">bailout referendum people took to the</text>
  <text start="435.54" dur="7.29">streets and they&amp;#39;re showing solidarity</text>
  <text start="438.14" dur="8.32">we see that a group of people went to</text>
  <text start="442.83" dur="7.26">the Greek supreme court trying to cancel</text>
  <text start="446.46" dur="5.67">the referendum and the grease Supreme</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="5.88">Court said no we&amp;#39;re going to let the</text>
  <text start="452.13" dur="6.03">referendum go forth and of course if we</text>
  <text start="455.97" dur="6.18">think about what&amp;#39;s going on here we can</text>
  <text start="458.16" dur="5.22">say ah these people were controlled by</text>
  <text start="462.15" dur="3.48">the central bankers or they were the</text>
  <text start="463.38" dur="4.11">central bankers themselves who went and</text>
  <text start="465.63" dur="3.42">said you know something let&amp;#39;s see if we</text>
  <text start="467.49" dur="3.6">can get this thing cancelled or they</text>
  <text start="469.05" dur="3.21">convince a group to say this is in the</text>
  <text start="471.09" dur="3.21">best interest just like they have the</text>
  <text start="472.26" dur="5.43">protesters out there trying to convince</text>
  <text start="474.3" dur="5.67">everyone yes we want austerity yes we</text>
  <text start="477.69" dur="5.16">want more debt yes we want more people</text>
  <text start="479.97" dur="5.67">unemployed yes we want people suffering</text>
  <text start="482.85" dur="4.89">on the streets with no food yes we want</text>
  <text start="485.64" dur="4.47">our children in poverty because we just</text>
  <text start="487.74" dur="6.18">had a UN report saying those countries</text>
  <text start="490.11" dur="9.03">that impose austerity the children grow</text>
  <text start="493.92" dur="6.96">up in poverty so we can see that all of</text>
  <text start="499.14" dur="3.63">this is being orchestrated by the</text>
  <text start="500.88" dur="6.14">central bankers they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="502.77" dur="8.16">convince everyone we need this yes vote</text>
  <text start="507.02" dur="5.89">now for the referendum the polling</text>
  <text start="510.93" dur="5.85">stations will be open from 7am to 7pm</text>
  <text start="512.91" dur="6.6">local time and there is a the result may</text>
  <text start="516.78" dur="5.16">be known before midnight pollsters</text>
  <text start="519.51" dur="5.19">haven&amp;#39;t confirmed if there will be exit</text>
  <text start="521.94" dur="6.69">polls now if there are no exit polls</text>
  <text start="524.7" dur="6.36">that is an indication that these this</text>
  <text start="528.63" dur="4.95">referendum i should say is completely</text>
  <text start="531.06" dur="6.03">fixed because the exit polls gives you</text>
  <text start="533.58" dur="5.52">some type of idea of how people are</text>
  <text start="537.09" dur="4.98">voting and when they do away with exit</text>
  <text start="539.1" dur="5.82">polls like they did in scotland this is</text>
  <text start="542.07" dur="5.94">a sure sign that this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="544.92" dur="4.41">fixed and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this</text>
  <text start="548.01" dur="4.86">plays out now there&amp;#39;s a software</text>
  <text start="549.33" dur="5.58">distributor singular logic which has</text>
  <text start="552.87" dur="5.34">been hired to run the vote counting and</text>
  <text start="554.91" dur="5.46">data processing and i don&amp;#39;t know again</text>
  <text start="558.21" dur="4.56">this is computer based so they could get</text>
  <text start="560.37" dur="4.769">in and somehow manipulate the numbers if</text>
  <text start="562.77" dur="3.659">they&amp;#39;d like and</text>
  <text start="565.139" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch a situation</text>
  <text start="566.429" dur="8.09">carefully watch what comes out of Greece</text>
  <text start="568.619" dur="8.791">watch what people spot and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="574.519" dur="6.521">take a look at this after the referendum</text>
  <text start="577.41" dur="5.909">to see if there was some type of</text>
  <text start="581.04" dur="5.279">manipulation and the votes came out to</text>
  <text start="583.319" dur="6.151">yes or it went smoothly no manipulation</text>
  <text start="586.319" dur="5.401">the people said okay we want no because</text>
  <text start="589.47" dur="5.399">you have to remember the people voted</text>
  <text start="591.72" dur="7.049">for tsipras they voted for this</text>
  <text start="594.869" dur="6.03">government to stop austerity to stop</text>
  <text start="598.769" dur="4.951">making these bad deals with the central</text>
  <text start="600.899" dur="6">bankers to put their country back on the</text>
  <text start="603.72" dur="6.389">track of economic growth this is why</text>
  <text start="606.899" dur="6.331">they voted for this government if the</text>
  <text start="610.109" dur="6.78">people come out now and vote yes it kind</text>
  <text start="613.23" dur="6.389">of counters what they voted for in the</text>
  <text start="616.889" dur="6.99">first place if they really decide to go</text>
  <text start="619.619" dur="7.231">with the central bankers agreement why</text>
  <text start="623.879" dur="7.05">did they vote for tsipras it makes no</text>
  <text start="626.85" dur="5.909">sense now we understand that Puerto Rico</text>
  <text start="630.929" dur="5.46">they cannot pay their debts and under</text>
  <text start="632.759" dur="6.62">the new Frank Dodd act guess what there</text>
  <text start="636.389" dur="4.98">are no bailouts for Puerto Rico and</text>
  <text start="639.379" dur="5.32">right now they&amp;#39;re trying to make the</text>
  <text start="641.369" dur="4.88">case if the IMF can bail out puerto rico</text>
  <text start="644.699" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="646.249" dur="5.14">to get the debt spread and to keep this</text>
  <text start="649.619" dur="3.78">thing propped up they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="651.389" dur="4.74">going down just yet and i&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="653.399" dur="6.331">about the economy because if it does go</text>
  <text start="656.129" dur="7.38">down who is to blame the central bankers</text>
  <text start="659.73" dur="5.279">and they know this so right now the IMF</text>
  <text start="663.509" dur="5.221">they&amp;#39;re trying to make the case that oh</text>
  <text start="665.009" dur="5.401">this could be an emerging type of</text>
  <text start="668.73" dur="7.069">country because it falls in the same</text>
  <text start="670.41" dur="12.179">category where you know Puerto Rico</text>
  <text start="675.799" dur="9.79">can&amp;#39;t pay the debt it has excessive</text>
  <text start="682.589" dur="6.391">borrowing inconsistent financial</text>
  <text start="685.589" dur="5.881">reporting and low tax collection so the</text>
  <text start="688.98" dur="4.229">kind of fits into the emerging type of</text>
  <text start="691.47" dur="5.309">countries where the IMF steps in and</text>
  <text start="693.209" dur="5.311">helps them out but again under the law</text>
  <text start="696.779" dur="3.781">as a</text>
  <text start="698.52" dur="5.01">us common wealthy Island also doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="700.56" dur="6.27">qualify for IMF aid but they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="703.53" dur="7.14">to make the case so they can bail it out</text>
  <text start="706.83" dur="5.94">and give them what more debt which we</text>
  <text start="710.67" dur="4.23">know is not going to help yes and the</text>
  <text start="712.77" dur="4.11">short term it will but you know what</text>
  <text start="714.9" dur="4.38">happens when that debt when that money</text>
  <text start="716.88" dur="4.56">runs out you&amp;#39;re back in the same</text>
  <text start="719.28" dur="7.65">position but worse because you have more</text>
  <text start="721.44" dur="6.9">debt and less revenue coming in here in</text>
  <text start="726.93" dur="5.97">the United States we see the</text>
  <text start="728.34" dur="6.51">unemployment rate is five point three</text>
  <text start="732.9" dur="5.22">percent we talked about the unemployment</text>

  <text start="1278" dur="5.09">symbolizes no that&amp;#39;s not freedom of</text>
  <text start="1280.37" dur="6.33">expression that&amp;#39;s not freedom of speech</text>
  <text start="1283.09" dur="6.7">the government doesn&amp;#39;t decide for you</text>
