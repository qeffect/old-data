  <text start="308.24" dur="5.959">class it wasn&amp;#39;t always this way we need</text>
  <text start="311.63" dur="6.69">to remember this a lot of people forgot</text>
  <text start="314.199" dur="7.391">if we go back in time it used to be a</text>
  <text start="318.32" dur="5.73">lot better actually if we go back in</text>
  <text start="321.59" dur="5.72">time before the Central Bank it was</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="5.459">incredible and since the central bank</text>
  <text start="327.31" dur="5.8">everything has just gotten worse</text>
  <text start="329.509" dur="7.41">as time goes on here are some more facts</text>
  <text start="333.11" dur="6.15">about jobs 30% of jobs are hardship jobs</text>

  <text start="356.27" dur="4.619">money way for retirement 15 percent are</text>
  <text start="359.03" dur="4.139">professional jobs paving the way for</text>
  <text start="360.889" dur="4.411">more comfortable life that includes more</text>
  <text start="363.169" dur="5.761">elaborate vacations and entertainment</text>
  <text start="365.3" dur="6.96">and a more expensive home and since the</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="6.419">central bank was implemented everything</text>
  <text start="372.26" dur="5.67">has gotten worse if we play this out for</text>
  <text start="375.349" dur="2.94">more years I mean past where we are</text>
  <text start="377.93" dur="4.049">today</text>

  <text start="381.979" dur="5.761">not going to get better it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="383.449" dur="6.69">get worse and for most Americans since</text>
  <text start="387.74" dur="4.5">the last recession that recession never</text>
  <text start="390.139" dur="4.65">ended for them they were never able to</text>
  <text start="392.24" dur="4.98">get back to where they were yes they</text>
  <text start="394.789" dur="4.711">were able to do without so they can live</text>
  <text start="397.22" dur="5.9">but they never got back to where they</text>
  <text start="399.5" dur="6.69">were now we&amp;#39;re seeing the entire</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="6.28">economic system deteriorate very very</text>
  <text start="406.19" dur="4.86">quickly we&amp;#39;re seeing homes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.4" dur="4.23">declining very rapidly we talked about</text>
  <text start="411.05" dur="4.89">the housing bubbles before now this has</text>
  <text start="413.63" dur="4.38">nothing to do with oh look what Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="415.94" dur="3.75">doing look what you know the past</text>
  <text start="418.01" dur="4.74">presidents have done yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="419.69" dur="6.599">partially to blame but it&amp;#39;s the central</text>
  <text start="422.75" dur="6.81">bank system the central bank system does</text>
  <text start="426.289" dur="5.31">not work it&amp;#39;s not designed to work it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.56" dur="2.67">only designed to put countries into debt</text>
  <text start="431.599" dur="3.511">and</text>
  <text start="432.23" dur="5.79">those at the top very very wealthy those</text>
  <text start="435.11" dur="5.85">at the top to have control that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="438.02" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s designed for and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="6.03">right now is the destruction of the</text>
  <text start="443.66" dur="6.09">central banking system and a lot of</text>
  <text start="446.99" dur="4.68">people are feeling it and as we move</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="4.23">forward right now with the Fed raising</text>
  <text start="451.67" dur="5.61">rates things are going to break apart</text>
  <text start="453.98" dur="6.42">and break down very very rapidly in San</text>
  <text start="457.28" dur="4.98">Diego right now home sales have</text>
  <text start="460.4" dur="5.34">collapsed by seventeen point five</text>
  <text start="462.26" dur="6.6">percent of lowest level in 11 years</text>
  <text start="465.74" dur="5.52">I mean think this is coming from core</text>
  <text start="468.86" dur="5.37">logic now they&amp;#39;re looking at this stuff</text>
  <text start="471.26" dur="3.99">go WOW things have rapidly changed this</text>
  <text start="474.23" dur="5.31">is unbelievable</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="7.79">in September there were 200 2942 homes</text>
  <text start="479.54" dur="8.1">that were sold in the county down from</text>
  <text start="483.04" dur="7.33">3568 sales last year so when we look at</text>
  <text start="487.64" dur="4.77">this we can see that San Diego is in</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="3.75">trouble this is just the beginning this</text>
  <text start="492.41" dur="4.86">is going to spread like wildfire to</text>
  <text start="494.12" dur="8.07">every single city think about this for a</text>
  <text start="497.27" dur="7.92">second back in 2007 right before the</text>
  <text start="502.19" dur="6.09">stock market came down before anyone</text>
  <text start="505.19" dur="4.74">really knew what was going on there were</text>
  <text start="508.28" dur="4.83">only two thousand one hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="509.93" dur="6.63">two homes sold in September of 2007</text>
  <text start="513.11" dur="8.58">compared to September of this year which</text>
  <text start="516.56" dur="8.4">is 2942 homes back then we were in a</text>
  <text start="521.69" dur="5.88">recession what are we in now if this</text>
  <text start="524.96" dur="4.05">number drops to where it was in 2007</text>
  <text start="527.57" dur="6.27">wouldn&amp;#39;t you say we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="529.01" dur="6.87">already yes we are and we need to</text>
  <text start="533.84" dur="6.06">remember something very very important</text>
  <text start="535.88" dur="6.66">here the central bank system was never</text>
  <text start="539.9" dur="4.56">designed to go this far the central bank</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="3.21">system was only designed to go to a</text>
  <text start="544.46" dur="2.55">certain point and they knew it was going</text>
  <text start="545.75" dur="3.39">to break down they knew it was going to</text>
  <text start="547.01" dur="4.2">collapse and they had to put and they</text>
  <text start="549.14" dur="3.81">had a you know plan for an event to</text>
  <text start="551.21" dur="5.19">cover it all up they don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="552.95" dur="5.73">right now so the plan now since Trump</text>
  <text start="556.4" dur="4.71">got into office and there are certain</text>
  <text start="558.68" dur="5.85">people working with him it&amp;#39;s to bring</text>
  <text start="561.11" dur="4.69">down the entire system it&amp;#39;s to bring</text>
  <text start="564.53" dur="4.719">down</text>
  <text start="565.8" dur="4.86">the central bank and you said well how</text>
  <text start="569.249" dur="3.291">do you know this what you&amp;#39;re just making</text>
  <text start="570.66" dur="5.549">this up how do you know this is the plan</text>
  <text start="572.54" dur="7.06">Q has already told us this Q is already</text>
  <text start="576.209" dur="7.32">said what they were going to do now</text>
  <text start="579.6" dur="5.459">remember when Trump was out there and he</text>
  <text start="583.529" dur="3.331">was saying that god I wish I can fire</text>
  <text start="585.059" dur="4.26">sessions I wish I can get rid of</text>
  <text start="586.86" dur="6.629">sessions he&amp;#39;s not really doing his job</text>
  <text start="589.319" dur="6.541">that was a strategy that he used to get</text>
  <text start="593.489" dur="5.64">the mainstream media the deep state to</text>
  <text start="595.86" dur="5.519">back sessions no no don&amp;#39;t fire sessions</text>
  <text start="599.129" dur="4.65">we like him there he&amp;#39;s doing the same</text>
  <text start="601.379" dur="4.89">thing with Powell right now he</text>
  <text start="603.779" dur="4.201">continually contradicts Powell he says I</text>
  <text start="606.269" dur="3.6">would like to get rid of Powell I like</text>
  <text start="607.98" dur="4.139">to replace Powell but I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="609.869" dur="4.981">do it right now and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="612.119" dur="7.71">right now is we&amp;#39;re seeing the mainstream</text>
  <text start="614.85" dur="8.07">media they are now backing Powell now</text>
  <text start="619.829" dur="6.031">this is exactly what Trump wants he</text>
  <text start="622.92" dur="5.849">wants them to back Powell</text>
  <text start="625.86" dur="5.729">why because when the system comes down</text>
  <text start="628.769" dur="5.28">he can say well you wanted him to do</text>
  <text start="631.589" dur="5.011">this you were backing him the entire</text>
  <text start="634.049" dur="5.97">time I was telling you this was not good</text>
  <text start="636.6" dur="5.729">for the economy if you look at CNBC Fed</text>
