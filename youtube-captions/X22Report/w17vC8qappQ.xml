  <text start="62.96" dur="6.89">banks and we all knew that eventually</text>
  <text start="66.17" dur="7.199">this would occur because right now</text>

  <text start="90.619" dur="3.75">to a point where they&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="92.72" dur="4.079">make a decision and I know that it</text>
  <text start="94.369" dur="4.051">Greece&amp;#39;s having a referendum and the</text>
  <text start="96.799" dur="4.14">people are going to vote should we stay</text>
  <text start="98.42" dur="4.89">with the EU or should we leave the EU at</text>
  <text start="100.939" dur="7.021">this time and we know that the IMF has</text>
  <text start="103.31" dur="9.659">been making plans for a default ed for</text>
  <text start="107.96" dur="7.289">Greece leaving the eurozone and time is</text>
  <text start="112.969" dur="5.07">running out for Greece at this point in</text>
  <text start="115.249" dur="5.19">time because they cannot make it verra</text>
  <text start="118.039" dur="5.19">focus was out there saying listen we do</text>
  <text start="120.439" dur="5.22">not have enough to make the next payment</text>
  <text start="123.229" dur="4.32">whatsoever so we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="125.659" dur="5.821">watch this situation very carefully and</text>
  <text start="127.549" dur="6.841">see what happens here now we notice here</text>
  <text start="131.48" dur="5.339">in the United States that gas prices now</text>
  <text start="134.39" dur="5.88">are increasing I&amp;#39;ve noticed that the</text>
  <text start="136.819" dur="6.541">pump I see out in Los Angeles the price</text>
  <text start="140.27" dur="6.41">of gas is basically almost up to four</text>
  <text start="143.36" dur="6.99">dollars once again and bryce&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="146.68" dur="6.01">basically creeping up and it no matter</text>
  <text start="150.35" dur="5.04">how much Saudi Arabia continually pumps</text>
  <text start="152.69" dur="5.55">out and floods the market prices are</text>
  <text start="155.39" dur="5.099">still going up at this time and it looks</text>
  <text start="158.24" dur="5.3">like they might be cutting back on that</text>
  <text start="160.489" dur="6.5">because we see that</text>
  <text start="163.54" dur="6.509">the United States is now making nice</text>
  <text start="166.989" dur="5.73">nice with Russia or are they we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="170.049" dur="4.291">about that a little bit later now here</text>
  <text start="172.719" dur="3.6">in the United States we understand that</text>
  <text start="174.34" dur="4.8">retail is completely falling apart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.319" dur="5.73">imploding on itself because right now</text>
  <text start="179.14" dur="4.439">Americans are tapped out they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="182.049" dur="3.631">have the funds to go out there and make</text>
  <text start="183.579" dur="3.571">those big purchases they don&amp;#39;t even have</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="3.479">enough money to make those small</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="3.419">purchases but of course the US</text>
  <text start="189.159" dur="3.631">government the central bankers are out</text>
  <text start="190.569" dur="4.831">there trying to convince us that no no</text>
  <text start="192.79" dur="4.559">they can still purchase all they need is</text>
  <text start="195.4" dur="5.1">a credit card and they can just add up</text>
  <text start="197.349" dur="5.551">the debt but guess what people right now</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="5.93">have so much debt they can&amp;#39;t make those</text>
  <text start="202.9" dur="6.78">small little payments anymore and we</text>
  <text start="206.43" dur="5.559">understand at this point in time that</text>
  <text start="209.68" dur="4.979">this whole thing is starting to crumble</text>
  <text start="211.989" dur="4.231">apart I mean think about this one out of</text>
  <text start="214.659" dur="5.041">every four american households spend</text>
  <text start="216.22" dur="6.389">half of their incomes just to cover the</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="4.409">rent or mortgage needless to say that</text>
  <text start="222.609" dur="3.451">doesn&amp;#39;t leave much for the shopping mall</text>
  <text start="224.109" dur="3.78">and this is one of the reasons why</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="3.299">people are not going out you have to</text>
  <text start="227.889" dur="3.511">remember these people came from high</text>
  <text start="229.359" dur="4.081">paying jobs they couldn&amp;#39;t find those</text>
  <text start="231.4" dur="4.199">jobs or at part time jobs now is this</text>
  <text start="233.44" dur="4.53">every single person in the country no so</text>
  <text start="235.599" dur="4.38">all those people are out there going oh</text>
  <text start="237.97" dur="5.31">well I have a great job yes there are</text>
  <text start="239.979" dur="5.73">still people that have good jobs but</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="5.97">this next round of layoffs said this</text>
  <text start="245.709" dur="6.18">next collapse hold on tight hopefully</text>
  <text start="249.25" dur="5.37">nothing happens to you but we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="251.889" dur="5.07">this before where people thought they</text>
  <text start="254.62" dur="3.899">were secure in their jobs they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="256.959" dur="4.62">really worrying and those were the</text>
  <text start="258.519" dur="6.811">people that were let go I mean there are</text>
  <text start="261.579" dur="5.791">other examples of why the economy is not</text>
  <text start="265.33" dur="4.95">improving why retail sales are</text>
  <text start="267.37" dur="6.72">continually falling the labor for the</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="7.44">labor force participation rate is at 38</text>
  <text start="274.09" dur="5.49">year lows right now with almost one in</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="5.1">three Americans not in the workforce</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="7.769">that&amp;#39;s over 93 million people completely</text>
  <text start="282.82" dur="7.86">not working and the other people who are</text>
  <text start="287.349" dur="5.94">working are not making the salaries</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="4.979">they&amp;#39;re working at part time jobs at</text>
  <text start="293.289" dur="3.56">this time and it&amp;#39;s very very difficult</text>
  <text start="295.659" dur="5.54">to</text>
  <text start="296.849" dur="8.49">take it today so what are we seeing us</text>
  <text start="301.199" dur="6.72">retailers are having problems we already</text>
  <text start="305.339" dur="4.83">understand that six thousand stores are</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="5.31">going to be closing this year they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="310.169" dur="5.55">already closed thousands upon thousands</text>
  <text start="313.229" dur="5.791">of stored closed last year we understand</text>
  <text start="315.719" dur="5.85">last holiday last Black Friday Cyber</text>
  <text start="319.02" dur="6.359">Monday were a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="321.569" dur="6.451">that&amp;#39;s during the hot time of the retail</text>
  <text start="325.379" dur="5.16">market we&amp;#39;re heading into the summer</text>
  <text start="328.02" dur="5.549">which is not the hot time for retail</text>
  <text start="330.539" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s hot for real estate but not for</text>
  <text start="333.569" dur="3.9">retail and we&amp;#39;re starting to see things</text>
  <text start="335.099" dur="4.08">start to really slow down now and a lot</text>
  <text start="337.469" dur="3.06">of economists are out there looking at</text>
  <text start="339.179" dur="5.371">the situation looking at the numbers</text>
  <text start="340.529" dur="5.82">saying yeah we are back in recession at</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="3.149">this point but of course the escarpment</text>
  <text start="346.349" dur="4.29">central bankers they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="347.699" dur="5.28">admit that they only admit that once the</text>
  <text start="350.639" dur="4.11">market comes crashing down and we might</text>
  <text start="352.979" dur="4.53">see that occur very soon now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="354.749" dur="5.37">lot of people talking about this fall or</text>
  <text start="357.509" dur="3.96">if it doesn&amp;#39;t happen this fall I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="360.119" dur="4.08">believe that we will make it through</text>
  <text start="361.469" dur="5.22">next year I believe it&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="364.199" dur="4.47">very very quickly and the whole entire</text>
  <text start="366.689" dur="6.09">system is going to come down and this</text>
  <text start="368.669" dur="6.39">time these big banks are completely</text>
  <text start="372.779" dur="5.7">insolvent at this time cannot be bailed</text>
  <text start="375.059" dur="5.7">out so they will be bailing in they will</text>
  <text start="378.479" dur="3.511">be going into the accounts to take the</text>
  <text start="380.759" dur="3.33">money and we see this happening in</text>
  <text start="381.99" dur="4.679">Greece right now the test case was</text>
  <text start="384.089" dur="4.26">Cyprus and we know that this is going to</text>
  <text start="386.669" dur="3.96">spread throughout all the European</text>
  <text start="388.349" dur="5.85">countries here in the United States</text>
  <text start="390.629" dur="7.95">Canada Australia New Zealand it will</text>
  <text start="394.199" dur="6.87">spread home builder sentiment is down</text>

  <text start="401.069" dur="7.88">expecting 57 despite all the previous</text>
  <text start="404.429" dur="8.85">hope for future sales traffic has fallen</text>

  <text start="415.079" dur="5.43">sentiment at this time consumers are</text>
  <text start="416.909" dur="6.57">exhibiting caution this is coming from</text>
  <text start="420.509" dur="6.15">the NAHB chief economist David Crowe</text>
  <text start="423.479" dur="5.61">saying they&amp;#39;re cautious right now before</text>

  <text start="429.089" dur="3.841">no people are just</text>
  <text start="430.71" dur="3.69">not going and making the purchase</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="3.36">because they don&amp;#39;t have the funds</text>

  <text start="490.74" dur="5.76">have a lot of student loan debt and</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="8.71">talking about student loan debt student</text>
  <text start="496.5" dur="8.19">loan debt is basically one of these the</text>
  <text start="501.96" dur="6.35">highest form of debt that has the</text>
  <text start="504.69" dur="6.81">highest rate of delinquency right now a</text>
  <text start="508.31" dur="6.82">large portion of this recovery here in</text>
  <text start="511.5" dur="9">the United States came from student loan</text>
  <text start="515.13" dur="7.92">and automobile loans that&amp;#39;s it it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="520.5" dur="6.09">come from the everyday person going out</text>
  <text start="523.05" dur="6.63">and purchasing these are the two things</text>
  <text start="526.59" dur="4.83">that the government could control they</text>
  <text start="529.68" dur="3.51">tell everyone to go back to school you</text>
  <text start="531.42" dur="3.45">can get a great job so people listen and</text>
  <text start="533.19" dur="4.11">they do it they take out the student</text>
  <text start="534.87" dur="5.52">loans colleges become more expensive you</text>
  <text start="537.3" dur="6.06">can&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t pay for this in cash so</text>
  <text start="540.39" dur="5.31">you take out loans they start accepting</text>
  <text start="543.36" dur="6.09">people who have subprime credit to go</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="5.64">into the auto industry they take out the</text>
  <text start="549.45" dur="3.9">loan they get the car they always wanted</text>
  <text start="551.34" dur="5.07">they stretch the payments over seven</text>
  <text start="553.35" dur="6.51">eight nine years everything seems fine</text>
  <text start="556.41" dur="5.49">until they can&amp;#39;t pay for it and this is</text>
  <text start="559.86" dur="3.419">what&amp;#39;s happening right now so right now</text>
  <text start="561.9" dur="9.32">this economy</text>
  <text start="563.279" dur="13.581">has been basically propped up by debt</text>
  <text start="571.22" dur="9.25">not economic growth basically it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="576.86" dur="5.62">debt and again garbage in garbage out</text>
  <text start="580.47" dur="4.409">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing I mean</text>
  <text start="582.48" dur="5.19">right now the student loans are about</text>
  <text start="584.879" dur="6.921">1.2 trillion and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="587.67" dur="7.649">that the number of delinquent people is</text>
  <text start="591.8" dur="6.31">continually rising and this is why Obama</text>
  <text start="595.319" dur="4.95">was out there telling everyone that they</text>
  <text start="598.11" dur="3.959">have new programs that they can defer</text>
  <text start="600.269" dur="2.76">you alone they can help you refinance</text>
  <text start="602.069" dur="3.301">your loan because they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="603.029" dur="4.711">realize that these people can&amp;#39;t pay it</text>
  <text start="605.37" dur="4.56">back and guess what you can&amp;#39;t write it</text>
  <text start="607.74" dur="5.25">off this is why he&amp;#39;s trying to change</text>
  <text start="609.93" dur="4.649">this he wants people to go bankrupt he</text>
  <text start="612.99" dur="3.87">wants people to write it off this way</text>
  <text start="614.579" dur="5.55">the government can bail the student loan</text>
  <text start="616.86" dur="6.599">debt problem out but right now they</text>
  <text start="620.129" dur="6.421">cannot do that we see manufacturing in</text>
  <text start="623.459" dur="4.86">this company country falling apart it is</text>
  <text start="626.55" dur="3.539">not getting better whatsoever we</text>
  <text start="628.319" dur="3.781">understand the bolter bolter Dry Index</text>
  <text start="630.089" dur="4.411">which is the shipment of raw material to</text>
  <text start="632.1" dur="4.95">factories and the factories are</text>
  <text start="634.5" dur="4.199">producing they order more raw material</text>
  <text start="637.05" dur="3.93">this is used for goods and other</text>
  <text start="638.699" dur="3.601">products and it&amp;#39;s sold all across the</text>
  <text start="640.98" dur="2.959">world and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="642.3" dur="4.32">that since the people aren&amp;#39;t buying</text>
  <text start="643.939" dur="4">companies aren&amp;#39;t purchasing factories</text>
  <text start="646.62" dur="3.36">aren&amp;#39;t producing they don&amp;#39;t need the raw</text>
  <text start="647.939" dur="4.471">material now we&amp;#39;ve seen the bowl to dry</text>
  <text start="649.98" dur="5.7">index go up a little bit this was</text>
  <text start="652.41" dur="5.88">because of these high capsize rates now</text>
  <text start="655.68" dur="5.459">it&amp;#39;s start and fall down again it&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="658.29" dur="5.399">630 it&amp;#39;s down four points once again and</text>
  <text start="661.139" dur="6.411">every time it&amp;#39;s propped up by hardwired</text>
  <text start="663.689" dur="6.471">rates it seems to drop down once again</text>

  <text start="984.83" dur="5.31">countries are doing it and the reason</text>
  <text start="989.15" dur="2.72">why they&amp;#39;re doing this is because</text>

  <text start="1640.48" dur="4.86">and we&amp;#39;ve captured and they did this</text>
  <text start="1642.88" dur="4.32">once before where they actually went</text>
  <text start="1645.34" dur="3.3">over the border a little bit or the</text>

  <text start="1648.64" dur="3.87">really no border line and they got them</text>
  <text start="1650.41" dur="3.81">and right now Louganis people are saying</text>
  <text start="1652.51" dur="6.9">no these are not Russian soldiers they</text>
  <text start="1654.22" dur="6.87">fight for us hear their ideas IDs and we</text>

  <text start="1668.29" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re trying to make but of course the</text>
  <text start="1669.73" dur="4.59">corporate media is all out they are</text>
  <text start="1671.59" dur="4.08">trying to convince everyone that yes we</text>
  <text start="1674.32" dur="6.84">have captured them and even if they did</text>
  <text start="1675.67" dur="7.95">it&amp;#39;s two soldiers that are in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1681.16" dur="5.79">actually there are officers in Ukraine</text>

  <text start="1686.95" dur="3.93">to come in to help with the mints to</text>
  <text start="1689.08" dur="3.42">agreement of course that was not</text>
  <text start="1690.88" dur="4.47">broadcasted all over the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1692.5" dur="5.97">they keep that kind of quiet and right</text>
  <text start="1695.35" dur="4.74">now these two soldiers they don&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="1698.47" dur="4.26">for the Russian government they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="1708.76" dur="3.96">have their IDs but we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="1710.679" dur="3.481">to see how this plays out and where this</text>
  <text start="1712.72" dur="3.089">goes maybe they&amp;#39;ll just return the</text>
  <text start="1714.16" dur="2.55">people just like they return the other</text>
  <text start="1715.809" dur="4.281">soldiers but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1716.71" dur="7.14">about this is they will only let certain</text>
  <text start="1720.09" dur="7.18">news reporters in to report this story</text>
  <text start="1723.85" dur="6.9">no outside reporters are allowed and</text>
  <text start="1727.27" dur="6.51">that raises some red flags for me now we</text>
  <text start="1730.75" dur="5.52">see that France is still holding on to</text>
  <text start="1733.78" dur="5.31">those Mistral ships Russia would like</text>

  <text start="1747.67" dur="4.65">always about 1.3 2 billion dollars for</text>
  <text start="1751" dur="3.15">canceling this contract now you have to</text>
  <text start="1752.32" dur="3.39">remember the United States is putting a</text>

  <text start="1755.71" dur="4.02">on France not to deliver these ships</text>
  <text start="1758.08" dur="5">friends would like to deliver these</text>
  <text start="1759.73" dur="5.46">ships but they cannot at this point</text>

  <text start="1875.32" dur="4.17">really pushing it and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1877.6" dur="4.829">the main strategy is to overthrow the</text>

  <text start="1997.409" dur="4.86">then they move to the next country and</text>
  <text start="1999.36" dur="5.34">we can see how they are progressing and</text>

  <text start="2219.59" dur="8.28">going in with ground troops now it looks</text>
  <text start="2223.61" dur="7.52">like there&amp;#39;s a 19-page strategy paper to</text>
  <text start="2227.87" dur="7.56">go into Libya and we understand that</text>
  <text start="2231.13" dur="5.83">Yemen Libya Lebanon Iraq they all have</text>
  <text start="2235.43" dur="4.32">the same problem the people are rising</text>
  <text start="2236.96" dur="5.13">up they want their country back and as</text>
  <text start="2239.75" dur="3.63">soon as the people push it too far this</text>
  <text start="2242.09" dur="3.51">is when the US government central</text>
  <text start="2243.38" dur="5.37">bankers step in and of course they use</text>
  <text start="2245.6" dur="6.33">proxy forces like Saudi Arabia to do</text>
  <text start="2248.75" dur="4.5">their dirty work because right now the</text>
  <text start="2251.93" dur="3.06">United States can&amp;#39;t get into these</text>
  <text start="2253.25" dur="5.22">countries because they do not have the</text>
  <text start="2254.99" dur="5.64">authorization for war but this 19-page</text>
  <text start="2258.47" dur="5.01">strategy paper for the mission obtained</text>
  <text start="2260.63" dur="5.03">by The Guardian focuses on air and naval</text>
  <text start="2263.48" dur="5.4">campaign in the Mediterranean and Libyan</text>
  <text start="2265.66" dur="6.04">territorial waters but it adds that</text>
  <text start="2268.88" dur="6.68">ground operations in Libya may be needed</text>
  <text start="2271.7" dur="6.03">to destroy those people who are</text>
  <text start="2275.56" dur="4.33">smuggling oil out of the country</text>
  <text start="2277.73" dur="5.97">basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is those</text>
  <text start="2279.89" dur="6.69">people who taking control of Libya they</text>
  <text start="2283.7" dur="5.46">are out there putting oil on ships and</text>
  <text start="2286.58" dur="5.58">selling it to other nations not using</text>
  <text start="2289.16" dur="4.77">the dollar and they do not like this ten</text>
  <text start="2292.16" dur="3.84">european union members have already</text>
  <text start="2293.93" dur="4.38">expressed their approval including Great</text>

  <text start="2303.8" dur="6.03">force to control the oil leaving Libya</text>
  <text start="2308.81" dur="3.95">and this is what they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="2309.83" dur="6.03">prepared for because the time has come</text>
  <text start="2312.76" dur="5.2">where the people have taken back their</text>

  <text start="2317.96" dur="5.4">selling it and now the central Baker&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2321.35" dur="4.05">need to put a stop to this and this is</text>
  <text start="2323.36" dur="5.28">what all these countries are doing at</text>
  <text start="2325.4" dur="6.09">this time now there is a security</text>
  <text start="2328.64" dur="5.58">researcher chris Roberts of one world he</text>
  <text start="2331.49" dur="4.26">has been speaking to the FBI and we</text>
  <text start="2334.22" dur="3.84">talked about this in previous reports</text>
  <text start="2335.75" dur="4.11">where they&amp;#39;re saying that the computer</text>
  <text start="2338.06" dur="4.8">systems of an airplane can be hacked and</text>
  <text start="2339.86" dur="4.41">they would be able to basically control</text>
  <text start="2342.86" dur="4.2">the plane or make it crash and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2344.27" dur="5.37">saying that yes he went ahead and he did</text>
  <text start="2347.06" dur="4.59">this he was able to basically increase</text>
  <text start="2349.64" dur="5.16">the thrust of one of the engines making</text>
  <text start="2351.65" dur="6.36">a change course he was able to basically</text>
  <text start="2354.8" dur="6.27">make the plane climb resulting in a</text>
  <text start="2358.01" dur="5.49">lateral or sideways movement he said he</text>
  <text start="2361.07" dur="4.74">did this about 15 times during flights</text>
  <text start="2363.5" dur="6.3">but really didn&amp;#39;t go beyond observing</text>
  <text start="2365.81" dur="6.87">data traffic and if this is true that</text>
  <text start="2369.8" dur="5.4">means anybody can get into these systems</text>
  <text start="2372.68" dur="5.4">and control these planes now of course</text>
  <text start="2375.2" dur="5.49">as we know the US government central</text>
  <text start="2378.08" dur="5.46">bankers are planning some type of an</text>
  <text start="2380.69" dur="4.74">event we also understand a lot of these</text>
  <text start="2383.54" dur="3.18">planes have remote control systems on</text>
  <text start="2385.43" dur="3">them where they can control them and</text>
  <text start="2386.72" dur="4.89">they don&amp;#39;t even eat passengers or a</text>
  <text start="2388.43" dur="5.64">flight crew on the plane to fly these</text>
  <text start="2391.61" dur="4.98">planes and basically they can just have</text>
  <text start="2394.07" dur="4.71">one of these planes or maybe a plane</text>
  <text start="2396.59" dur="4.56">that they have sitting someplace else</text>
  <text start="2398.78" dur="9.93">and they can just go ahead and use this</text>
  <text start="2401.15" dur="11.76">plane for an event and we see that the</text>
