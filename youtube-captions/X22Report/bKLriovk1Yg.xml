  <text start="100.97" dur="5.82">media the Internet in general allows</text>
  <text start="104.42" dur="4.41">people to talk about things outside of</text>

  <text start="132.95" dur="3.39">that corporate media has been pumping</text>
  <text start="134.6" dur="6.02">out a lot of propaganda which turns out</text>

  <text start="177.59" dur="6.739">learn about the truth through these</text>
  <text start="180.11" dur="6.58">different platforms and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="184.329" dur="4.911">all of us</text>
  <text start="186.69" dur="5.49">in leadership have to find ways in which</text>

  <text start="198.66" dur="4.44">that reinforce their own views one of</text>
  <text start="201.69" dur="2.97">the dangers of the Internet is that</text>
  <text start="203.1" dur="4.86">people can have entirely different</text>
  <text start="204.66" dur="4.92">realities they can be cocooned in</text>
  <text start="207.96" dur="5.43">information that reinforces their</text>
  <text start="209.58" dur="6.6">current biases well this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="213.39" dur="4.74">they were doing and what is happening is</text>
  <text start="216.18" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re losing the narrative they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="4.74">losing the push of this misinformation</text>
  <text start="220.95" dur="3.72">the propaganda that they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="222.87" dur="3.96">out there and a lot of the things that</text>
  <text start="224.67" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us turns out to be</text>
  <text start="226.83" dur="5.43">fake phony and false and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="4.56">to break it down and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="232.26" dur="4.17">realize that yes everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="5.3">been discussing everything that been</text>
  <text start="236.43" dur="6.48">pushed out there we&amp;#39;ve been analyzing</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="4.36">we&amp;#39;ve been researching and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="3.62">noticing that what they were saying</text>
  <text start="244.59" dur="4.23">compared to what we were looking at</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="4.6">completely do two different things and</text>
  <text start="248.82" dur="3.33">the alternative media the social media</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="3.51">of those people that are pushing</text>
  <text start="252.15" dur="3.809">different stories out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.64" dur="4.62">based in reality</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="5.491">and the propaganda is not now the</text>
  <text start="259.26" dur="5.76">corporate media they were supposed to be</text>
  <text start="261.45" dur="6.93">pushing out facts they&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="265.02" dur="6.33">have information that backed up their</text>
  <text start="268.38" dur="6.03">facts linking it to it or providing</text>
  <text start="271.35" dur="5.01">where they got these facts from but a</text>
  <text start="274.41" dur="4.83">lot of times what they do is they just</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="5.19">give information back by nothing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.24" dur="5.37">propaganda and they usually use words</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="4.53">like you know an unnamed anonymous</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="3.78">source</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="4.47">we have no documents or facts to back</text>
  <text start="288.39" dur="3.54">this up the whole Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="290.55" dur="2.7">things they had nothing to back it up</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="3.66">whatsoever they just made it up out of</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="5.25">thin air and then when you start digging</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="4.65">you start to realize that all of this</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="3.21">has turned out to be fake and this is</text>
  <text start="300.24" dur="2.88">why he&amp;#39;s out there right now because</text>
  <text start="301.71" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re very nervous because one</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="4.35">investigations start and they look into</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="4.5">the backgrounds of what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="307.47" dur="5.34">doing the spying the uranium one the</text>
  <text start="310.08" dur="4.86">pedo ring the child trafficking and</text>
  <text start="312.81" dur="5.729">everything else and you follow the money</text>
  <text start="314.94" dur="5.28">you follow the real facts you start to</text>
  <text start="318.539" dur="3.601">find out the truth</text>
  <text start="320.22" dur="5.07">this is what they really don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="322.14" dur="5.67">happen every time in the past where they</text>
  <text start="325.29" dur="4.83">presented anything like Assad is gassing</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="3.87">his own people they never could show</text>
  <text start="330.12" dur="4.71">proof they only show the aftermath</text>
  <text start="331.68" dur="5.52">showing the aftermath is not proof it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="5.1">like showing an earthquake that happened</text>
  <text start="337.2" dur="5.31">in a city saying that this was done by a</text>
  <text start="339.93" dur="4.14">nuclear weapon and they&amp;#39;re just showing</text>
  <text start="342.51" dur="2.7">you the aftermath well where&amp;#39;s the link</text>
  <text start="344.07" dur="3.18">to a nuclear weapon where&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="345.21" dur="3.45">radiation where&amp;#39;s the link who shot it</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="4.11">where did it come from</text>
  <text start="348.66" dur="4.68">do you have satellite imagery nothing</text>
  <text start="351.36" dur="3.59">like that and they do this with</text>
  <text start="353.34" dur="4.56">everything Assad gassing his own people</text>
  <text start="354.95" dur="4.18">yes they showed people that look like</text>
  <text start="357.9" dur="3.48">maybe they were gassed they were in a</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="4.74">hospital maybe something happened but</text>
  <text start="361.38" dur="5.19">where&amp;#39;s the evidence of who did it they</text>
  <text start="363.87" dur="5.85">never could produce that and that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="366.57" dur="5.01">you know it&amp;#39;s propaganda we see right</text>
  <text start="369.72" dur="4.38">now and we mentioned this in a report a</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="5.97">couple days ago where satellite images</text>
  <text start="374.1" dur="7.68">showed a Hong Kong ship giving fuel to a</text>
  <text start="377.55" dur="6.09">North Korean ship South Korea said they</text>
  <text start="381.78" dur="4.32">use the u.s. reconnaissance satellites</text>
  <text start="383.64" dur="4.29">and they captured this now they&amp;#39;ve taken</text>
  <text start="386.1" dur="4.95">the ship into custody</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="5.01">and they&amp;#39;re holding it saying that yes</text>
  <text start="391.05" dur="3.36">they were transferring fuel now China is</text>
  <text start="392.94" dur="4.38">out there saying this is absolutely not</text>
  <text start="394.41" dur="4.29">true whatsoever this didn&amp;#39;t happen we</text>
  <text start="397.32" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re talking about and</text>
  <text start="398.7" dur="4.41">once again North Korea it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="401.52" dur="6.18">matter because North Korea will always</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="7.32">find a way to get fuel to get currency</text>
  <text start="407.7" dur="5.34">to get the supplies they need Iran has</text>
  <text start="410.43" dur="5.549">been doing it series been doing it North</text>
  <text start="413.04" dur="6.42">Korea is doing it Cuba has been doing it</text>
  <text start="415.979" dur="8.19">there&amp;#39;s always a way around all of this</text>
  <text start="419.46" dur="6.959">and this is what these individuals in</text>
  <text start="424.169" dur="5.041">the US don&amp;#39;t understand the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="426.419" dur="4.471">that sanctions really don&amp;#39;t work they</text>
  <text start="429.21" dur="3.51">never have it sounds great on the</text>
  <text start="430.89" dur="3.87">corporate media it sounds great that</text>
  <text start="432.72" dur="4.89">this is what they&amp;#39;re doing but they</text>
  <text start="434.76" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t work at all and there&amp;#39;s proof that</text>
  <text start="437.61" dur="3.57">they don&amp;#39;t because there&amp;#39;s always a way</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="4.919">there&amp;#39;s always a black market for</text>
  <text start="441.18" dur="6.06">everything and again if somebody really</text>
  <text start="444.419" dur="5.041">needs something they&amp;#39;ll pay for it we</text>
  <text start="447.24" dur="4.44">see Russia and Turkey they sign loan</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="4.65">loan agreements on the supply of the</text>
  <text start="451.68" dur="3.57">s400 air defense system and it look</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="3.72">like Turkey&amp;#39;s going to be taking</text>
  <text start="455.25" dur="5.37">delivery very soon and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="457.83" dur="5.46">hitting the s400 air defense system in</text>
  <text start="460.62" dur="6.33">their country we see there&amp;#39;s this story</text>
  <text start="463.29" dur="6.15">out there that the US and Israel reached</text>
  <text start="466.95" dur="5.78">a joint strategic plan to counter</text>
  <text start="469.44" dur="6.15">Iranian influence in the Middle East now</text>
  <text start="472.73" dur="5.38">again this is something that they put</text>
  <text start="475.59" dur="4.95">out there and the Cabal wants everyone</text>
  <text start="478.11" dur="4.38">convinced that there&amp;#39;s some type of</text>
  <text start="480.54" dur="4.92">strategic plan now the plan has always</text>
  <text start="482.49" dur="5.37">been the same go into Syria have regime</text>
  <text start="485.46" dur="6.15">change go into Iran have regime change</text>
  <text start="487.86" dur="6.87">and we knew that the Cabal they were</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="6.9">preparing to do something very soon</text>
  <text start="494.73" dur="5.31">because their entire goal was to have</text>
  <text start="498.51" dur="3.93">regime change in Iran if they can get</text>
  <text start="500.04" dur="5.01">Iran to fall they&amp;#39;re thinking they can</text>
  <text start="502.44" dur="5.16">go back to Syria and have regime change</text>
  <text start="505.05" dur="4.26">there now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="507.6" dur="4.11">Iran has been under sanctions for a very</text>
  <text start="509.31" dur="6.14">long time they&amp;#39;ve had the p5 plus 1 deal</text>
  <text start="511.71" dur="6.96">which doesn&amp;#39;t allow them to acquire</text>
  <text start="515.45" dur="6.67">nuclear weapons now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="518.67" dur="7.98">interesting is that this us-israel</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="7.8">strategic plan is to make sure that Iran</text>
  <text start="526.65" dur="6.72">never gets nuclear weapons while the p5</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="4.89">plus 1 deal make sure that they never</text>
  <text start="533.37" dur="4.11">get nuclear weapons it was put into</text>
  <text start="534.81" dur="6.72">place on purpose so they could have</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="7.26">regime change so this plan that they</text>
  <text start="541.53" dur="4.47">have the strategic plan that first part</text>
  <text start="544.74" dur="3.45">is already done</text>
  <text start="546" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re also saying they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="548.19" dur="3.99">counter Iranian activity in the region</text>
  <text start="550.17" dur="6.15">we&amp;#39;ll talk about that in a little while</text>
  <text start="552.18" dur="7.05">to see what Iran is doing in the region</text>
  <text start="556.32" dur="4.98">to see if that holds water they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="559.23" dur="3.93">be countering Iranian ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="561.3" dur="3.99">development and the Iranian precision</text>
  <text start="563.16" dur="4.02">project in manufacturing precision</text>
  <text start="565.29" dur="4.14">guided missiles that is not covered</text>
  <text start="567.18" dur="5.76">under the p5 plus 1 deal they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="569.43" dur="6.09">want them to have any type of systems</text>
  <text start="572.94" dur="4.38">that can you know fire a weapon into</text>
  <text start="575.52" dur="3.69">other countries now it looks like</text>
  <text start="577.32" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re not going to be invading Iran</text>
  <text start="579.21" dur="6.75">because they have the s-300s 400 systems</text>
  <text start="582.9" dur="4.92">that they purchased from Russia and we</text>
  <text start="585.96" dur="3.42">could see that they need a different way</text>
  <text start="587.82" dur="3.24">of getting in there now what is</text>
  <text start="589.38" dur="4.19">happening right now is Iran is looking</text>
  <text start="591.06" dur="4.77">for ways to get around sanctions and</text>
  <text start="593.57" dur="4.21">they&amp;#39;re looking at the cryptocurrency so</text>
  <text start="595.83" dur="2.79">is North Korea so as many other</text>
  <text start="597.78" dur="2.61">countries they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="598.62" dur="3.96">cryptocurrencies where they can use this</text>
  <text start="600.39" dur="5.07">to get around sanctions Venezuela is</text>
  <text start="602.58" dur="5.97">looking to set up a petro cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="605.46" dur="4.86">to sell oil and this is one way where</text>
  <text start="608.55" dur="4.53">they can get around all the sanctions</text>
  <text start="610.32" dur="4.59">that the u.s. places on them and they</text>
  <text start="613.08" dur="4.17">need to stop these countries before this</text>
  <text start="614.91" dur="6.69">happens now it&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="617.25" dur="8.28">that at this moment all of a sudden Iran</text>
  <text start="621.6" dur="7.74">is having protests that is occurring in</text>
  <text start="625.53" dur="5.4">different cities around Iran and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="629.34" dur="4.98">think it&amp;#39;s about six different cities</text>
  <text start="630.93" dur="5.22">where people are rising up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.32" dur="5.22">very upset about the government about</text>
  <text start="636.15" dur="6.09">the economy and they&amp;#39;re screaming that</text>
  <text start="639.54" dur="4.8">we need to have regime change we need to</text>
  <text start="642.24" dur="4.14">get rid of our leader and this fits into</text>
  <text start="644.34" dur="5.4">the same exact model that has been in</text>
  <text start="646.38" dur="6.48">use over and over and over again here is</text>
  <text start="649.74" dur="6.72">the first event and it has just been</text>
  <text start="652.86" dur="5.64">initiated what they do is they bring in</text>
  <text start="656.46" dur="4.92">these protesters from the out from the</text>

  <text start="663.6" dur="3.27">hundreds of thousands of people if not</text>
  <text start="665.34" dur="3.03">millions of people at small groups and</text>
  <text start="666.87" dur="3.03">they spread them around the country they</text>
  <text start="668.37" dur="4.5">tried this with Russia and China already</text>
  <text start="669.9" dur="5.82">and what they do is they get the people</text>
  <text start="672.87" dur="5.97">going and what they hope is that more</text>
  <text start="675.72" dur="4.74">people will join this movement and if</text>
  <text start="678.84" dur="4.5">they can get more people to join this</text>
  <text start="680.46" dur="5.07">movement that means they can get it off</text>
  <text start="683.34" dur="3.51">the ground where they can push a regime</text>
  <text start="685.53" dur="3.84">change now a lot of the corporate media</text>
  <text start="686.85" dur="4.05">is not really saying much just yet some</text>
  <text start="689.37" dur="3.09">of the corporate media is saying new it</text>
  <text start="690.9" dur="4.8">looks like something&amp;#39;s happening in Iran</text>
  <text start="692.46" dur="5.19">we might be seeing regime change there</text>
  <text start="695.7" dur="3.75">remember this was the last country they</text>
  <text start="697.65" dur="4.71">wanted this to happen and we knew they</text>
  <text start="699.45" dur="4.73">were going to try to do something and we</text>
  <text start="702.36" dur="4.35">need to look at the entire situation</text>
  <text start="704.18" dur="4.93">Iran is working with Russia and China</text>
  <text start="706.71" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re selling their oil outside of the</text>
  <text start="709.11" dur="4.89">US dollar they&amp;#39;re working with Russia</text>
  <text start="712.23" dur="3.78">and China they&amp;#39;re making economic deals</text>
  <text start="714" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re joining their systems and they</text>
  <text start="716.01" dur="4.02">just recently joined Russia&amp;#39;s economic</text>
  <text start="718.26" dur="3.48">system and we see that they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="720.03" dur="3.6">for to use cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="721.74" dur="3.93">to bypass sanctions and it just so</text>
  <text start="723.63" dur="5.45">happens that all of a sudden there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="725.67" dur="6.72">protests going on at this exact moment</text>
  <text start="729.08" dur="6.18">where they needed to start something so</text>
  <text start="732.39" dur="5.1">this tells us already that this has been</text>
  <text start="735.26" dur="4">manufactured to make us believe that</text>
  <text start="737.49" dur="3.51">this is happening and if you look at the</text>
  <text start="739.26" dur="3.09">pictures yes there are people out there</text>
  <text start="741" dur="3.54">and of course this is their groups that</text>
  <text start="742.35" dur="3.72">they pay and this is from the</text>
  <text start="744.54" dur="3.18">intelligence agencies a lot of times</text>
  <text start="746.07" dur="5.91">Soros is behind all of this</text>
  <text start="747.72" dur="6.15">and they use this to build momentum now</text>
  <text start="751.98" dur="5.28">let&amp;#39;s go back to the part where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="753.87" dur="6.84">saying that Iran they are you know</text>
  <text start="757.26" dur="8.15">pushing different terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="760.71" dur="7.05">around the Middle East now 13 of the 14</text>
  <text start="765.41" dur="6.55">groups identified by the US intelligence</text>

  <text start="797.61" dur="4.02">with when they were invading Syria</text>
  <text start="799.83" dur="7.08">trying to go after the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="801.63" dur="9">that&amp;#39;s Sunni so the Society of the</text>

  <text start="823.14" dur="5.67">group</text>
  <text start="823.76" dur="7.99">the rest were created by the u.s. Israel</text>
  <text start="828.81" dur="6.57">Saudi Arabia the coalition forces the</text>
  <text start="831.75" dur="8.61">terrorist groups that they&amp;#39;re citing are</text>
  <text start="835.38" dur="9.06">not Iranian they&amp;#39;re from the US Israel</text>
  <text start="840.36" dur="5.91">Saudi Arabia yes Qatar Jordan and the</text>
  <text start="844.44" dur="4.53">rest of the coalition for the UK the</text>
  <text start="846.27" dur="8.01">rest that&amp;#39;s where the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="848.97" dur="6.149">are from so Iran is not a sponsor of</text>
  <text start="854.28" dur="3.659">terror</text>
  <text start="855.119" dur="6.84">in the middle-east actually Iran was</text>
  <text start="857.939" dur="6">invited into Syria to help fight the</text>
  <text start="861.959" dur="4.92">Islamic state al Qaeda the other</text>
  <text start="863.939" dur="5.61">terrorist groups that were there and if</text>
  <text start="866.879" dur="5.01">we go back in time we can see that there</text>
  <text start="869.549" dur="5.55">were terrorist attacks inside of Iran</text>
  <text start="871.889" dur="4.62">that were sponsored by the US they were</text>
  <text start="875.099" dur="3.81">carried out by the US Joint Special</text>
  <text start="876.509" dur="5.52">Operations Command over the past 30</text>
  <text start="878.909" dur="6.9">years and if you look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="882.029" dur="6.12">that it&amp;#39;s the United States the Israel</text>
  <text start="885.809" dur="5.91">the coalition forces that have been</text>
  <text start="888.149" dur="5.85">pushing terror in the Middle East all of</text>
  <text start="891.719" dur="3.66">this is to convince you and the</text>
  <text start="893.999" dur="3">corporate media just keeps repeating it</text>
  <text start="895.379" dur="3.63">repeating it repeating it that Iran is</text>
  <text start="896.999" dur="4.56">the sponsor of terror in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="899.009" dur="5.55">when actually it&amp;#39;s the opposite they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="901.559" dur="5.52">trying right now the Cabal is trying to</text>
  <text start="904.559" dur="4.83">push some type of regime change in Iran</text>
  <text start="907.079" dur="3.24">they know they can&amp;#39;t invade Russia and</text>
  <text start="909.389" dur="2.88">China back it up</text>
  <text start="910.319" dur="5.07">so they&amp;#39;re trying this tactic that</text>
  <text start="912.269" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;ve used in Ukraine Mayview they</text>
  <text start="915.389" dur="4.98">tried to use it in Syria they use it in</text>
  <text start="917.699" dur="4.2">Iraq they use it in Libya and eventually</text>
  <text start="920.369" dur="5.22">if they can get something off the ground</text>
  <text start="921.899" dur="6.69">and they can get all of this happening</text>
  <text start="925.589" dur="6.59">most likely the u.s. is going to try to</text>
  <text start="928.589" dur="6.15">get involved in helping these</text>
  <text start="932.179" dur="6.1">individuals which I mean by the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="934.739" dur="5.84">going to try to push the agenda in Iran</text>
  <text start="938.279" dur="4.77">to push it along and we see right now</text>
  <text start="940.579" dur="6.4">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do</text>
  <text start="943.049" dur="8.7">and this is their first attempt of their</text>
  <text start="946.979" dur="6.54">first event to try to start war this is</text>
  <text start="951.749" dur="4.68">eventually what they want</text>
  <text start="953.519" dur="4.59">and remember they never give up on their</text>
  <text start="956.429" dur="3">goals because remember they were trying</text>
  <text start="958.109" dur="2.52">to go through all the Middle East have</text>
  <text start="959.429" dur="4.62">regime change in all these countries</text>
  <text start="960.629" dur="5.04">into Syria the last country was Iran now</text>
  <text start="964.049" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re going to try to go into Iran and</text>
  <text start="965.669" dur="5.37">work backwards remember the p51 teapot</text>
  <text start="968.549" dur="4.5">the p5 plus 1 deal was to make sure they</text>
  <text start="971.039" dur="4.41">never got nuclear weapons if they had</text>
  <text start="973.049" dur="5.58">nuclear weapons there could be no</text>
  <text start="975.449" dur="6.36">invasion of Iran they won&amp;#39;t invade a</text>
  <text start="978.629" dur="5.341">country that is nuclear backed and they</text>
  <text start="981.809" dur="3.51">needed to make sure that they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="983.97" dur="3.449">going to be nuclear back because in</text>
  <text start="985.319" dur="3.521">Syria it was taking a very long time to</text>
  <text start="987.419" dur="2.831">have regime change</text>
  <text start="988.84" dur="3.72">Syria right now is kind of out of the</text>
  <text start="990.25" dur="4.35">picture so they have the skip over Syria</text>
  <text start="992.56" dur="3.69">go to Iran and we could see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="994.6" dur="3.39">trying in Ukraine they&amp;#39;re trying in Iran</text>
  <text start="996.25" dur="3.96">and North Korea they keep rotating and</text>
  <text start="997.99" dur="4.71">it looks like this is the first part of</text>
  <text start="1000.21" dur="5.13">the event where they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="1002.7" dur="4.44">something to happen here we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="1005.34" dur="3.39">a lot more of these in 2018 because what</text>
  <text start="1007.14" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is things are</text>
  <text start="1008.73" dur="5.13">rapidly falling apart we see that US</text>
  <text start="1011.46" dur="4.83">helicopters have evacuated the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1013.86" dur="4.41">state leaders from several areas across</text>
  <text start="1016.29" dur="4.92">the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor and</text>
  <text start="1018.27" dur="4.29">this is coming from reports of residents</text>
  <text start="1021.21" dur="4.08">who are living in the area saying yeah</text>
  <text start="1022.56" dur="5.37">the u.s. flew in the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1025.29" dur="5.61">leaders boarded the plane the</text>
  <text start="1027.93" dur="5.46">helicopters and they remove them from</text>
  <text start="1030.9" dur="3.23">the area we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this quite</text>
  <text start="1033.39" dur="4.11">often</text>
  <text start="1034.13" dur="6.01">Russia has evidence of all of this and</text>
  <text start="1037.5" dur="5.4">what is happening right now evidence is</text>
  <text start="1040.14" dur="6.27">coming out which which is proving that</text>
  <text start="1042.9" dur="4.86">the Cabal is behind the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1046.41" dur="2.7">and all those terrorist groups because</text>
  <text start="1047.76" dur="3.9">remember all of these groups were</text>
  <text start="1049.11" dur="5.13">created by them and they&amp;#39;re paid</text>
  <text start="1051.66" dur="4.8">covertly by them some write on the books</text>
  <text start="1054.24" dur="6.78">but we could see right now they are</text>
  <text start="1056.46" dur="6.78">using these paid mercenaries to blanket</text>
  <text start="1061.02" dur="4.8">the Middle East and have disruptions in</text>
  <text start="1063.24" dur="5.25">the Middle East so here we are right now</text>
  <text start="1065.82" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re at the end of 2017 we knew there</text>
  <text start="1068.49" dur="2.97">was going to be some type of an event we</text>
  <text start="1069.99" dur="2.91">didn&amp;#39;t know what it was going to be but</text>
  <text start="1071.46" dur="3.57">we knew they were going to try to start</text>
  <text start="1072.9" dur="4.47">something so all of a sudden out of</text>
  <text start="1075.03" dur="4.92">nowhere we see that there are protests</text>
  <text start="1077.37" dur="4.56">in six or seven cities right now it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1079.95" dur="4.41">small handful of people that are out</text>
  <text start="1081.93" dur="4.02">there and they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="1084.36" dur="2.43">something out and around now is this</text>
  <text start="1085.95" dur="3.12">going to work</text>
  <text start="1086.79" dur="4.26">most likely not it looks like China and</text>
  <text start="1089.07" dur="3.9">Russia they tried out there to have</text>
  <text start="1091.05" dur="4.02">certain protests and it was locked down</text>
  <text start="1092.97" dur="3.66">very very quickly and I think the same</text>
  <text start="1095.07" dur="3.84">thing is going to happen this is not a</text>
  <text start="1096.63" dur="3.99">grassroots uprising this is not</text>
  <text start="1098.91" dur="4.8">something that just appeared I didn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1103.71" dur="4.68">playbook they&amp;#39;ve been using over and</text>
  <text start="1105.63" dur="4.95">over and I expected in 2018 we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1108.39" dur="5.25">see a big push in other areas and</text>
  <text start="1110.58" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re gonna keep rotating until they</text>
  <text start="1113.64" dur="6.18">can&amp;#39;t do it anymore until everything is</text>
  <text start="1115.98" dur="6.12">locked down but again they could go the</text>
  <text start="1119.82" dur="2.86">next step where they have something even</text>
