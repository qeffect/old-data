  <text start="115.63" dur="3.58">investigating the Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="117.59" dur="4.44">which I don&amp;#39;t believe he was actually</text>
  <text start="119.21" dur="4.95">placed in there to investigate the</text>
  <text start="122.03" dur="3.66">Russian collusion because as we know</text>
  <text start="124.16" dur="3.33">from project Veritas and from other</text>
  <text start="125.69" dur="4.05">sources that this whole Russian</text>
  <text start="127.49" dur="5.88">collusion was a nothing burger it was</text>
  <text start="129.74" dur="6.45">completely made up and he was already in</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="5.61">the inside understanding that this was a</text>
  <text start="136.19" dur="5.04">made-up type of thing I think he was in</text>
  <text start="138.98" dur="4.14">there trying to cover the tracks and</text>
  <text start="141.23" dur="3.21">cover and you know remove certain</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="4.53">documents or get rid of certain</text>
  <text start="144.44" dur="5.52">documents and it looks like he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="147.65" dur="4.98">fast enough and what we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="149.96" dur="5.25">see now is that the dominoes are falling</text>
  <text start="152.63" dur="5.46">it looks like it doesn&amp;#39;t look good for</text>
  <text start="155.21" dur="7.26">the Cabal we&amp;#39;re already seeing that the</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="6.6">fusion GPS they were subpoenaed they</text>
  <text start="162.47" dur="4.58">didn&amp;#39;t want to hand over you know their</text>
  <text start="164.69" dur="6.78">accounting records they didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="167.05" dur="6.73">tell anyone who was the group or person</text>
  <text start="171.47" dur="5.55">who hired them to create the Trump</text>
  <text start="173.78" dur="5.22">dossier and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="177.02" dur="4.35">information is out there now and it</text>
  <text start="179" dur="5.879">looks like it&amp;#39;s confirmed that it was</text>
  <text start="181.37" dur="5.37">the Clinton campaign lawyer acting for</text>
  <text start="184.879" dur="6.061">Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="186.74" dur="9.66">campaign where this lawyer hired fusion</text>
  <text start="190.94" dur="7.14">GPS and created the dossier and it looks</text>
  <text start="196.4" dur="3.75">like this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="198.08" dur="4.68">Washington Post there&amp;#39;s a well sourced</text>
  <text start="200.15" dur="4.29">article one of the only well sourced</text>
  <text start="202.76" dur="5.03">articles that I&amp;#39;ve seen in a very long</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="8.04">time and it shows that yeah</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="9.37">Hillary Clinton is behind the Trump</text>
  <text start="212.48" dur="8.34">dossier and the DNC right now is now</text>
  <text start="217.16" dur="6.48">moving away from a hill Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="220.82" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re separating themselves and we see</text>
  <text start="223.64" dur="7.44">at this point that this is going to be</text>
  <text start="225.98" dur="6.84">very very damaging and at this point</text>
  <text start="231.08" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see what the Cabal</text>
  <text start="232.82" dur="5.51">does now</text>
  <text start="234.26" dur="7.29">the question is why was this leaked now</text>
  <text start="238.33" dur="6.55">why all of a sudden did this just come</text>
  <text start="241.55" dur="5.49">out well maybe it was leaked because</text>
  <text start="244.88" dur="4.71">Mueller&amp;#39;s investigation is finally</text>
  <text start="247.04" dur="6.24">asking some hard questions he couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="249.59" dur="7.5">get rid of the documents and everything</text>
  <text start="253.28" dur="5.579">was leading towards Clinton and there</text>
  <text start="257.09" dur="3.72">was nothing he could do because the team</text>
  <text start="258.859" dur="4.261">around him and individuals that were</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="5.64">looking at him asking questions well</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re the ones who were pressuring him</text>
  <text start="266.45" dur="3.93">into saying what is this there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="268.67" dur="3.51">Russian collusion because he&amp;#39;s been in</text>
  <text start="270.38" dur="4.02">there for a very long time investigating</text>
  <text start="272.18" dur="3.54">this couldn&amp;#39;t find anything he&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="2.22">at the Podesta group he&amp;#39;s looking at</text>
  <text start="275.72" dur="3.42">other documents there&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="276.62" dur="5.01">individuals in there and it looks like</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="4.83">at this point that he was caught up and</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="5.67">all this couldn&amp;#39;t dispose of the records</text>
  <text start="283.97" dur="7.29">in time and people are now asking a lot</text>
  <text start="287.3" dur="7.23">of questions so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="291.26" dur="5.88">now is things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="294.53" dur="6.45">and it does not look good for the Cabal</text>
  <text start="297.14" dur="5.07">now once again we&amp;#39;ve seen something like</text>
  <text start="300.98" dur="4.29">this before</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="5.31">where information comes out people are</text>
  <text start="305.27" dur="4.74">going to be questioned now if there is</text>
  <text start="307.52" dur="5.01">some type of an event just like you know</text>
  <text start="310.01" dur="4.02">9/11 when there was what 10 trillion</text>
  <text start="312.53" dur="3.33">dollars missing from the Pentagon that</text>
  <text start="314.03" dur="3.51">happened the day before and then</text>
  <text start="315.86" dur="3.69">everyone just forgot about it there</text>
  <text start="317.54" dur="2.49">might be some type of an event there</text>
  <text start="319.55" dur="3.27">might some</text>
  <text start="320.03" dur="5.34">there something might happen where all</text>
  <text start="322.82" dur="5.01">of a sudden all eyes are taken off of</text>
  <text start="325.37" dur="4.74">that and they&amp;#39;re moved someplace else</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="4.1">and we never go back to that so this is</text>
  <text start="330.11" dur="5.58">something that we need to watch because</text>
  <text start="331.93" dur="7.12">we can see that this is going to drag in</text>
  <text start="335.69" dur="5.97">other individuals and it&amp;#39;s going to lead</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="4.53">to something else and it&amp;#39;s gonna people</text>
  <text start="341.66" dur="4.38">gonna follow the money and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="343.58" dur="3.54">find out a lot more and we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.04" dur="2.91">gonna be a certain point where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="3.72">gonna say hey we can&amp;#39;t let them find out</text>
  <text start="348.95" dur="5.19">any more information because this is</text>
  <text start="350.84" dur="4.68">gonna open up everything to the public</text>
  <text start="354.14" dur="3.99">and this is not going to be good so I</text>
  <text start="355.52" dur="5.07">would expect some type of wag the dog</text>
  <text start="358.13" dur="4.23">type of an event to occur but we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="3.99">to watch this very carefully we see the</text>
  <text start="362.36" dur="3.84">US intelligence officials are fighting</text>
  <text start="364.58" dur="4.02">to renew the controversial spying</text>
  <text start="366.2" dur="4.89">program which allows agencies to conduct</text>
  <text start="368.6" dur="4.92">bulk surveillance on Internet users now</text>
  <text start="371.09" dur="4.11">this is section 702 of the Foreign</text>
  <text start="373.52" dur="3.39">Intelligence Surveillance Act which</text>
  <text start="375.2" dur="4.53">gives us intelligence permission to spy</text>
  <text start="376.91" dur="4.59">on and store Internet data and</text>
  <text start="379.73" dur="5.3">communications of foreign people living</text>
  <text start="381.5" dur="6.96">outside of the US now George W Bush</text>
  <text start="385.03" dur="6.37">authorized this whole thing it&amp;#39;s set to</text>
  <text start="388.46" dur="5.01">expire on December 31st if Congress</text>
  <text start="391.4" dur="4.17">doesn&amp;#39;t renew it now hopefully they</text>
  <text start="393.47" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t renew it because again this is a</text>
  <text start="395.57" dur="5.19">violation of our rights and of the</text>
  <text start="398.54" dur="4.32">amendments and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="400.76" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;ve renewed it in the past but this</text>
  <text start="402.86" dur="3.63">time I think it&amp;#39;s time for them to say</text>
  <text start="404.21" dur="4.44">you know something this should not be</text>
  <text start="406.49" dur="5.78">renewed because as we can see through</text>
  <text start="408.65" dur="7.35">Obama they were spying on Trump using</text>
  <text start="412.27" dur="5.4">the same thing the section 702 of the</text>
  <text start="416" dur="5.37">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</text>
  <text start="417.67" dur="7.66">which allows them to spy on American</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="6.66">citizens without any type of warrant now</text>
  <text start="425.33" dur="4.97">I know they say that oh if we capture an</text>
  <text start="428.03" dur="4.98">American it&amp;#39;s supposed to be you know</text>
  <text start="430.3" dur="6.22">masked and you need special permission</text>
  <text start="433.01" dur="4.98">and court orders to unmask it but we</text>
  <text start="436.52" dur="2.34">know that this isn&amp;#39;t the fact that we</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="4.89">know that there are certain individuals</text>
  <text start="438.86" dur="6.9">that went above and beyond and were able</text>
  <text start="442.88" dur="5.13">to unmask without you know any type of</text>
  <text start="445.76" dur="3.69">court order or anything like that they</text>
  <text start="448.01" dur="3.51">just did it because they said Oh</text>
  <text start="449.45" dur="4.53">national security we need to know this</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="3.92">now some of the spying programs review</text>
  <text start="453.98" dur="4.38">by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden</text>
  <text start="455.44" dur="6.7">Snowden which included in the section</text>
  <text start="458.36" dur="5.85">702 our prism upstream and prism sweeps</text>
  <text start="462.14" dur="4.89">up data from tech giants like Apple</text>
  <text start="464.21" dur="4.74">Google Facebook and Microsoft upstream</text>
  <text start="467.03" dur="3.29">is a form of bulk surveillance used to</text>
  <text start="468.95" dur="3.84">search Internet traffic and</text>
  <text start="470.32" dur="5.35">communications as they are in transit</text>
  <text start="472.79" dur="5.52">via cables and routers we also know they</text>
  <text start="475.67" dur="5.13">embedded malware into certain chips and</text>
  <text start="478.31" dur="4.55">they were installed in computers and we</text>
  <text start="480.8" dur="5.85">see at this point that now is the time</text>
  <text start="482.86" dur="7.42">to stop all this we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="486.65" dur="5.4">government spying on people and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.28" dur="3.36">really what it&amp;#39;s used for it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re not looking at different</text>
  <text start="493.64" dur="3.75">governments they can do that no matter</text>
  <text start="495.44" dur="4.38">what because it&amp;#39;s not covered by the</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="5.16">Constitution what they&amp;#39;re really doing</text>
  <text start="499.82" dur="6.3">is they&amp;#39;re using this to spy on everyday</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="7.35">Americans and now it is enough we need</text>
  <text start="506.12" dur="6.6">to stop it it can&amp;#39;t be renewed and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="509.9" dur="7.019">have to see what happens here now out in</text>
  <text start="512.72" dur="6.21">Spain and Catalan Catalonia we see that</text>
  <text start="516.919" dur="6.111">well things are starting to escalate</text>
  <text start="518.93" dur="9.12">quite a bit and we know that Spain</text>
  <text start="523.03" dur="7.87">invoked article 155 which takes away the</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="5.04">power of Catalonia and the Catalan</text>
  <text start="530.9" dur="4.86">separates leader said listen we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="533.09" dur="5.25">going to abide by this the Catalan</text>
  <text start="535.76" dur="4.83">people are out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="538.34" dur="6.33">the moment has come we need to defend</text>
  <text start="540.59" dur="8.43">the Republic we&amp;#39;re going to push for our</text>
  <text start="544.67" dur="8.25">independence and once again Spain is not</text>
  <text start="549.02" dur="6.69">going to sit by we might see a civil war</text>
  <text start="552.92" dur="5.7">break out from all of this we see there</text>
  <text start="555.71" dur="4.62">are two US aircraft carriers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.62" dur="4.71">heading to the Pacific because Trump is</text>
  <text start="560.33" dur="5.91">traveling to East Asia we see the USS</text>
  <text start="563.33" dur="5.82">Theodore Roosevelt the USS Nimitz they</text>
  <text start="566.24" dur="4.83">are in the Korea area and once again</text>
  <text start="569.15" dur="4.77">there are drills going on which are</text>
  <text start="571.07" dur="5.67">provoking North Korea and Trump is</text>
  <text start="573.92" dur="4.53">visiting different Asian countries at</text>
  <text start="576.74" dur="4.5">this point now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="578.45" dur="5.25">out in Libya right now the United States</text>
  <text start="581.24" dur="4.32">is taking a hands-off approach to Libya</text>
  <text start="583.7" dur="3.66">saying listen these individuals need to</text>
  <text start="585.56" dur="5">work this out themselves</text>
  <text start="587.36" dur="7.62">and the UN roadmap you know having that</text>
  <text start="590.56" dur="6.219">unelected government in in Libya where</text>
  <text start="594.98" dur="5.76">the people didn&amp;#39;t elect this government</text>
  <text start="596.779" dur="7.05">well this is starting to falter and we</text>
  <text start="600.74" dur="5.73">see that the UN government well it has</text>
  <text start="603.829" dur="5.101">stalled the people are not looking at</text>
  <text start="606.47" dur="5.07">this group of individuals as the</text>
  <text start="608.93" dur="4.74">government we see half car is taking</text>
  <text start="611.54" dur="4.56">more and more control it looks like he</text>
  <text start="613.67" dur="5.22">might be taking over Tripoli and if he</text>
  <text start="616.1" dur="5.91">does this it it&amp;#39;s going to be the end of</text>
  <text start="618.89" dur="4.92">the un-backed government which means the</text>
  <text start="622.01" dur="4.259">UN the United States the coalition</text>
  <text start="623.81" dur="4.92">forces they&amp;#39;re going to be pushed out</text>
  <text start="626.269" dur="4.26">completely and the people are going to</text>
  <text start="628.73" dur="5.13">take over the country now half tar has a</text>
  <text start="630.529" dur="5.881">relationship with Putin and we can see</text>
  <text start="633.86" dur="5.31">at this time that once this happens</text>
  <text start="636.41" dur="4.38">Russia is going to can start to control</text>
  <text start="639.17" dur="3.24">the Middle East they&amp;#39;ve controlled many</text>
  <text start="640.79" dur="4.56">parts of it but they&amp;#39;re going to control</text>
  <text start="642.41" dur="4.65">a lot more we see the Iraqi Kurds</text>
  <text start="645.35" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re calling for immediate ceasefire</text>
  <text start="647.06" dur="6.6">and cessation to all military operations</text>
  <text start="650.57" dur="5.61">we see Baghdad is moving in taking</text>
  <text start="653.66" dur="4.44">control of the Kurdish area and the</text>
  <text start="656.18" dur="4.05">referendum right now received no</text>
