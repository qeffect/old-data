  <text start="72.49" dur="3.659">they&amp;#39;re being bailed out and how the</text>
  <text start="74.29" dur="4.32">situation looks like the bear stearns</text>
  <text start="76.149" dur="3.631">type of moment where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="78.61" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t worry about it everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="79.78" dur="5.369">contained and nothing is wrong here</text>
  <text start="82.45" dur="4.89">please look over there and not over here</text>
  <text start="85.149" dur="3.691">but when we look at this situation we</text>
  <text start="87.34" dur="4.169">can see that the situation is actually</text>
  <text start="88.84" dur="5.22">getting worse as time goes on right now</text>
  <text start="91.509" dur="6.601">it looks like home capital their</text>

  <text start="98.11" dur="6.27">and you have to remember if we go back</text>
  <text start="99.88" dur="6.33">to the Greek bailout of 2015 and we look</text>
  <text start="104.38" dur="3.42">at the deposits in the banks we saw</text>
  <text start="106.21" dur="3.54">people continually taking their funds</text>
  <text start="107.8" dur="3.84">out of the bank and when we look at home</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="4.86">Capital Group it looks like the same</text>
  <text start="111.64" dur="5.52">thing is happening here where people are</text>

  <text start="121.81" dur="5.399">money and we want it before it fails now</text>
  <text start="124.959" dur="5.64">we have to look into the future here a</text>
  <text start="127.209" dur="5.701">little bit because once other banks</text>
  <text start="130.599" dur="3.961">start to fail you know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="132.91" dur="3.75">happen we know there&amp;#39;s a bail and</text>
  <text start="134.56" dur="3.899">document we know it&amp;#39;s not just here in</text>
  <text start="136.66" dur="3.42">the United States we know the UK is not</text>
  <text start="138.459" dur="3.39">the only other country that has a balun</text>
  <text start="140.08" dur="2.94">document document we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.849" dur="4.051">throughout Europe and many other</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="6.15">countries and we know eventually what</text>
  <text start="145.9" dur="5.1">they will do to stop the bank runs they</text>
  <text start="149.17" dur="3.69">will shut the banks down now they call</text>
  <text start="151" dur="4.41">them a bank holiday where they say oh</text>
  <text start="152.86" dur="4.5">maybe there&amp;#39;s a glitch in the system or</text>
  <text start="155.41" dur="4.02">something went on we need to shut it</text>
  <text start="157.36" dur="3.93">down maybe they&amp;#39;ll say there&amp;#39;s a cyber</text>
  <text start="159.43" dur="3.12">attack or something like that where they</text>
  <text start="161.29" dur="3.12">have to shut the banks down and once</text>
  <text start="162.55" dur="4.17">they do shut the bank&amp;#39;s down they will</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="5.549">then implement capital controls this is</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="5.79">one way to stop people from taking out</text>
  <text start="169.959" dur="4.411">their currency and then they will go in</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="3.66">and take the currency from the bank and</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="4.02">pretty much you&amp;#39;ll be left with nothing</text>
  <text start="176.17" dur="4.32">this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen in the</text>
  <text start="178.39" dur="3.81">future and we can see already people</text>
  <text start="180.49" dur="4.5">are already wide to this because they</text>
  <text start="182.2" dur="5.04">seen it going back in time where the</text>
  <text start="184.99" dur="5.07">system starts to deteriorate the bank</text>
  <text start="187.24" dur="3.93">starts to have troubles and people run</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="2.94">to the bank and say you know something</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="4.11">let my get let me get my currency before</text>
  <text start="193" dur="4.38">the whole entire banking system shuts</text>
  <text start="195.28" dur="4.2">down and capital controls are</text>
  <text start="197.38" dur="3.72">implemented and I can&amp;#39;t get anything now</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="3.06">a lot of people have seen what happened</text>
  <text start="201.1" dur="2.73">in Greece where they ran to the banks</text>
  <text start="202.54" dur="3.87">because the people saw what happened in</text>
  <text start="203.83" dur="4.47">Cyprus where those people didn&amp;#39;t run to</text>
  <text start="206.41" dur="3.72">the banks to get their funds out and all</text>
  <text start="208.3" dur="4.47">those people lost you know hundreds of</text>
  <text start="210.13" dur="4.29">thousands of dollars that they saved and</text>
  <text start="212.77" dur="3.99">put into the bank and then they had</text>
  <text start="214.42" dur="4.23">capital controls for over a year where</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="4.17">they couldn&amp;#39;t really get to it at all</text>
  <text start="218.65" dur="5.76">and we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="7.14">housing problem well it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="224.41" dur="4.56">isolated in one area we see out in</text>
  <text start="228.07" dur="3.42">Toronto</text>
  <text start="228.97" dur="6.27">well the bubbles are being blown up</text>
  <text start="231.49" dur="6.3">bigger and bigger and bigger and what</text>
  <text start="235.24" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now according to the</text>
  <text start="237.79" dur="4.92">Bank of Canada and Ministry of Finance</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="5.54">high ratio mortgage borrowers are</text>
  <text start="242.71" dur="5.79">extending themselves to the limit and</text>
  <text start="245.94" dur="5.38">these high ratio mortgages with low</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="6.24">income levels is a growing trend in</text>
  <text start="251.32" dur="5.82">Canada but Toronto and Vancouver will</text>
  <text start="254.74" dur="5.49">they take it to the next level across</text>
  <text start="257.14" dur="5.13">Canada 18 percent of high-risk mortgages</text>
  <text start="260.23" dur="4.17">have extremely low incomes for the homes</text>
  <text start="262.27" dur="4.59">therein and an increase of 38 percent</text>
  <text start="264.4" dur="4.17">over two years despite Vancouver&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.86" dur="4.32">insanely high prices</text>
  <text start="268.57" dur="5.73">Toronto still tops the risky business of</text>
  <text start="271.18" dur="6.99">subprime borrowers Toronto takes the top</text>
  <text start="274.3" dur="6.54">spot with a 53% increase during the same</text>
  <text start="278.17" dur="5.28">period bringing their total to 49</text>
  <text start="280.84" dur="5.64">percent coming in second is Vancouver</text>
  <text start="283.45" dur="6.06">which had a 25% increase over the past</text>
  <text start="286.48" dur="6.08">two years bringing their total to 39%</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="5.64">these two cities are moving much faster</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="4.9">than the average for the country and</text>
  <text start="295.15" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re getting to dangerously high</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="5.94">levels on what this means is the bubbles</text>
  <text start="301.39" dur="3.84">are growing and growing and growing and</text>
  <text start="303.4" dur="4.29">getting bigger and what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="305.23" dur="5.61">see is a lot of these bubbles pop we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.69" dur="6.18">already on track for this and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="6.12">to get worse out in India we see</text>
  <text start="313.87" dur="5.12">India is cracking down on cash as we</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="5.34">know they&amp;#39;re not allowing them to use</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="6.31">debit or credit cards what has taken</text>
  <text start="322.3" dur="5.76">hold is actually a money app a mobile</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="6.45">money app on the phone and people are</text>
  <text start="328.06" dur="5.43">using this to make payments now out in</text>
  <text start="331.75" dur="5.22">South Korea they&amp;#39;re doing away with</text>
  <text start="333.49" dur="5.58">coins and giving people payment cards</text>
  <text start="336.97" dur="3.93">where they&amp;#39;ll get their change on a card</text>
  <text start="339.07" dur="4.17">so a lot of these countries right now</text>
  <text start="340.9" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re doing away with cash at least</text>
  <text start="343.24" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re trying to make that move and</text>
  <text start="344.71" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re trying to basically create some</text>
  <text start="348.01" dur="4.56">type of electronic system which is still</text>
  <text start="351.13" dur="3.33">controlled by the central bank it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="352.57" dur="4.05">like Bitcoin where that&amp;#39;s completely out</text>
  <text start="354.46" dur="4.44">of the control of the central bank they</text>
  <text start="356.62" dur="3.87">want people in this electronic system</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="3.62">that is controlled by the central bank</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="6.32">to keep control of the people because</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="7.75">once they have you with using complete</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="5.11">electronic currency you can never take</text>
  <text start="370.27" dur="4.77">the currency out and hold it physically</text>
  <text start="371.92" dur="5.82">so you&amp;#39;re always in their system you</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="4.23">can&amp;#39;t escape the system and they always</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="4.65">know what you&amp;#39;re doing and they can</text>
  <text start="379.27" dur="6.06">close your account or deny you something</text>
  <text start="382.39" dur="6.06">with a flick of a switch we see here in</text>
  <text start="385.33" dur="5.46">United States American consumers they</text>
  <text start="388.45" dur="6.27">are holding one trillion in revolving</text>
  <text start="390.79" dur="5.43">credit mostly in credit card debt and we</text>
  <text start="394.72" dur="4.59">see that this is actually getting worse</text>
  <text start="396.22" dur="4.47">and worse credit card specialist Capital</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="4.35">One disclosed in its first quarter</text>

  <text start="409.63" dur="7.65">percent year-over-year to 1.5 billion</text>
  <text start="413.73" dur="7.42">dollars now consumer debt in the u.s. it</text>
  <text start="417.28" dur="5.82">is piling up right now there&amp;#39;s 1.4</text>
  <text start="421.15" dur="4.38">trillion in student loans which is</text>
  <text start="423.1" dur="3.96">already in crisis mode and the</text>
  <text start="425.53" dur="3.33">government backs them and they cannot be</text>
  <text start="427.06" dur="4.29">charged off unless there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="428.86" dur="4.26">going on in your personal life and you</text>
  <text start="431.35" dur="2.94">say hey listen I can&amp;#39;t pay this off and</text>
  <text start="433.12" dur="5.49">you have to prove to the government but</text>
  <text start="434.29" dur="6.98">otherwise you cannot do anything but pay</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="6.08">this off even if you don&amp;#39;t have a job</text>
  <text start="441.27" dur="5.79">you still have to pay it off in the end</text>
  <text start="444.69" dur="4.38">unless you make an incredible</text>
  <text start="447.06" dur="3.57">case of how you can get out of it most</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="4.38">of the time they&amp;#39;ll defer the payments</text>
  <text start="450.63" dur="4.68">until you&amp;#39;re back up on your feet we see</text>
  <text start="453.45" dur="5.67">the auto loan industry in the subprime</text>
  <text start="455.31" dur="7.89">loan package with auto loans is around</text>
  <text start="459.12" dur="7.26">1.1 trillion and this is a scenario</text>
  <text start="463.2" dur="5.55">where it&amp;#39;s almost like the subprime</text>
  <text start="466.38" dur="5.28">security in real estate but now they</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="6.6">have done this in auto loans and we can</text>
  <text start="471.66" dur="6">see right now according to a study 35 %</text>
  <text start="475.35" dur="4.62">of people said they pay as much as they</text>
  <text start="477.66" dur="5.25">can on each of their debt each month but</text>
  <text start="479.97" dur="4.83">they can&amp;#39;t keep up with it 19% said they</text>
  <text start="482.91" dur="3.96">pay off debts with the highest interest</text>
  <text start="484.8" dur="4.26">first and make minimum payments to</text>
  <text start="486.87" dur="4.019">others and what we&amp;#39;re seeing from all</text>
  <text start="489.06" dur="5.669">this is that people are having a very</text>
  <text start="490.889" dur="6.571">difficult time surviving and paying off</text>
  <text start="494.729" dur="5.431">all this debt especially when wages and</text>
  <text start="497.46" dur="4.53">income are continually declining when</text>
  <text start="500.16" dur="4.259">people are losing their jobs and retail</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="4.56">and corporations and business is</text>
  <text start="504.419" dur="4.381">starting to slow and I&amp;#39;m hearing from a</text>
  <text start="506.55" dur="4.14">lot of people that business is starting</text>
  <text start="508.8" dur="5.1">to slow and things are not looking good</text>
  <text start="510.69" dur="5.58">out in the corporate world right now and</text>
  <text start="513.9" dur="4.889">we can see that all of this is happening</text>
  <text start="516.27" dur="3.09">at once I mean look what is happening</text>
  <text start="518.789" dur="3.56">right now</text>
  <text start="519.36" dur="5.63">retail is in contraction GDP is</text>
  <text start="522.349" dur="5.081">absolutely awful and that is a</text>
  <text start="524.99" dur="4.9">manipulated number we&amp;#39;re actually in the</text>
  <text start="527.43" dur="4.23">negative range for GDP we look at</text>
  <text start="529.89" dur="4.74">corporate defaults we look at the</text>
  <text start="531.66" dur="5.07">default on credit cards we look at auto</text>
  <text start="534.63" dur="4.26">loans and the delinquencies on auto</text>
  <text start="536.73" dur="4.62">loans we look at what&amp;#39;s happening around</text>

  <text start="541.35" dur="5.81">just continually losing their jobs the</text>
  <text start="543.39" dur="6.63">situation is actually dire right now and</text>
  <text start="547.16" dur="5.35">the entire system is declining quick</text>
  <text start="550.02" dur="5.31">much faster than anyone thought now</text>
  <text start="552.51" dur="6.66">Congress will they reached a deal to</text>
  <text start="555.33" dur="7.2">extend the debt ceiling until October</text>
  <text start="559.17" dur="7.2">1st and they&amp;#39;re allowing the government</text>
  <text start="562.53" dur="6.54">to spend another trillion dollars to</text>
  <text start="566.37" dur="4.14">keep the government operational and we</text>
  <text start="569.07" dur="4.23">know that this is not a good situation</text>
  <text start="570.51" dur="4.92">in itself we know this is not going to</text>
  <text start="573.3" dur="4.98">help the situation because really think</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="5.069">about it going back in time they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="578.28" dur="4.589">always raised the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="580.499" dur="6.93">and now we&amp;#39;re going to spend a trillion</text>
  <text start="582.869" dur="6.93">dollars from May until October and we</text>
  <text start="587.429" dur="5.19">can see the spending is accelerating</text>
  <text start="589.799" dur="4.98">right now and as it continually</text>
  <text start="592.619" dur="3.57">accelerates it&amp;#39;s not going to help the</text>
  <text start="594.779" dur="3.42">situation because we&amp;#39;re just adding more</text>
  <text start="596.189" dur="4.32">and more debt more of our people losing</text>
  <text start="598.199" dur="4.41">the job less revenue is coming into the</text>
  <text start="600.509" dur="4.35">government it cannot pay the interest on</text>
  <text start="602.609" dur="6.3">this debt and that means the whole</text>
  <text start="604.859" dur="5.88">system cannot operate and that&amp;#39;s what we</text>
  <text start="608.909" dur="4.14">are seeing right now that&amp;#39;s where we are</text>
  <text start="610.739" dur="5.4">headed now think about what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="613.049" dur="8.46">doing right now GDP came out with a</text>
  <text start="616.139" dur="6.9">point 7 percent number and the Fed is</text>
  <text start="621.509" dur="3.63">looking at this saying well don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="623.039" dur="4.77">about that that&amp;#39;s a one-off thing we</text>
  <text start="625.139" dur="6.42">believe that the the country is going to</text>
  <text start="627.809" dur="5.43">grow at 3% from here on and nobody has</text>
  <text start="631.559" dur="4.92">to worry about it well this is</text>
  <text start="633.239" dur="5.52">absolutely ridiculous because when did</text>
  <text start="636.479" dur="4.68">they ever see the country grow at 3%</text>
  <text start="638.759" dur="7.23">when was the last time it actually grew</text>
  <text start="641.159" dur="7.02">3% for a year it hasn&amp;#39;t and remember</text>
  <text start="645.989" dur="3.9">this GDP number has been manipulated but</text>
  <text start="648.179" dur="4.68">what they&amp;#39;re really trying to do is</text>

  <text start="688.769" dur="5.43">now minuchin he came out and said</text>
  <text start="691.679" dur="5.76">everyone should thank me for the recent</text>
  <text start="694.199" dur="4.8">rise in bank stocks and then Trump came</text>
  <text start="697.439" dur="2.55">out and he said this at 8:00 10:00</text>
  <text start="698.999" dur="3.78">Eastern Standard Time</text>
  <text start="699.989" dur="5.01">Trump came out around 9:50 1:00 Eastern</text>
  <text start="702.779" dur="4.95">Standard Time and says you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="704.999" dur="6.09">actively considering breaking up the big</text>
  <text start="707.729" dur="6.03">banks and bringing back glass-steagall</text>
  <text start="711.089" dur="3.631">and you have to remember glass-steagall</text>
  <text start="713.759" dur="2.701">was</text>
  <text start="714.72" dur="4.56">put into place right after the Great</text>
  <text start="716.46" dur="6.26">Depression this way banks couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="719.28" dur="7.47">speculate with their investments and</text>
  <text start="722.72" dur="6.79">moving into the I think it was 1999</text>
  <text start="726.75" dur="6.27">going into mm laughs evil was removed</text>
  <text start="729.51" dur="5.22">and banks were able to speculate this is</text>
  <text start="733.02" dur="3.78">where the subprime securities came about</text>
  <text start="734.73" dur="4.65">and this is where everything started to</text>
  <text start="736.8" dur="4.98">go wrong now he&amp;#39;s looking to bring back</text>
  <text start="739.38" dur="6.63">glass-steagall break up the big banks</text>
  <text start="741.78" dur="7.89">and most likely go after the central</text>
  <text start="746.01" dur="4.71">bank remember Andrew Jackson is one of</text>
  <text start="749.67" dur="3.66">his heroes</text>
  <text start="750.72" dur="6.21">he put he&amp;#39;s hung his portrait right</text>
  <text start="753.33" dur="7.38">behind him and the reason he&amp;#39;s done this</text>
  <text start="756.93" dur="6.27">is because Andrew Jackson got rid of the</text>
  <text start="760.71" dur="4.92">second bank of the United States which</text>
  <text start="763.2" dur="4.5">was a central bank he got rid of it</text>
  <text start="765.63" dur="5.52">completely that&amp;#39;s what he campaigned on</text>
  <text start="767.7" dur="6.45">and it looks like Trump is heading down</text>
  <text start="771.15" dur="5.46">the same exact path I mean when have you</text>
  <text start="774.15" dur="6.09">ever heard a president come out and say</text>
  <text start="776.61" dur="4.62">hey I&amp;#39;m considering breaking up the big</text>
  <text start="780.24" dur="4.83">banks</text>
  <text start="781.23" dur="7.23">what other president hung Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="785.07" dur="6.27">up in their office I mean the central</text>
  <text start="788.46" dur="5.46">bank they wanted a wipe Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="791.34" dur="5.52">off the $20 bill that was their plan so</text>
  <text start="793.92" dur="5.94">they you completely forget that he</text>
  <text start="796.86" dur="7.29">removed the central bank actually if you</text>
  <text start="799.86" dur="7.62">go previous to 1913 there was mention in</text>
  <text start="804.15" dur="5.49">the children&amp;#39;s history books about the</text>
  <text start="807.48" dur="5.43">central banks and how the destructive</text>
  <text start="809.64" dur="5.31">and after 1913 it was like stricken from</text>
  <text start="812.91" dur="4.5">history they didn&amp;#39;t want you to know</text>
  <text start="814.95" dur="6.48">anything about it and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="817.41" dur="7.62">right now is he&amp;#39;s making the move he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="821.43" dur="6.72">making his move to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="825.03" dur="6.33">banking system the way we have it today</text>
  <text start="828.15" dur="5.52">and normally when someone comes out and</text>
  <text start="831.36" dur="3.51">talks about the banking or the central</text>
  <text start="833.67" dur="4.52">banks or anything like this</text>
  <text start="834.87" dur="5.94">well it doesn&amp;#39;t end up well for them and</text>
  <text start="838.19" dur="4.21">there was an attempt on Andrew Jackson&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="840.81" dur="4.23">life because he was trying to get rid of</text>
  <text start="842.4" dur="5.43">the central bank and most likely there</text>
  <text start="845.04" dur="3.299">will be an attempt on Trump&amp;#39;s life once</text>
  <text start="847.83" dur="2.989">he started</text>
  <text start="848.339" dur="5.19">making this move and we can see that</text>
  <text start="850.819" dur="4.721">Trump says a lot of things he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="853.529" dur="4.381">there he&amp;#39;s causing chaos I think this is</text>
  <text start="855.54" dur="4.769">all part of his plan to keep the</text>
  <text start="857.91" dur="4.679">corporate media you know going all over</text>
  <text start="860.309" dur="5.13">the place and trying to figure out what</text>
  <text start="862.589" dur="5.701">he&amp;#39;s all about and I think in the</text>
  <text start="865.439" dur="5.01">background he has a strategy he knows</text>
  <text start="868.29" dur="4.169">what he needs to do he knows he needs to</text>
  <text start="870.449" dur="4.95">go after the central bank he knows this</text>
  <text start="872.459" dur="4.201">is the cause of the problem and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="875.399" dur="3.62">going to have to watch this very</text>
  <text start="876.66" dur="5.369">carefully because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="879.019" dur="4.36">once he starts making his move towards</text>
  <text start="882.029" dur="3.631">the central bank and I know people think</text>
  <text start="883.379" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s just that easy but now these these</text>
  <text start="885.66" dur="4.469">characters in the central bank in the</text>
  <text start="887.999" dur="2.791">deep state they don&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="890.129" dur="4.411">happen</text>
  <text start="890.79" dur="6.659">think about how wealthy they become from</text>
  <text start="894.54" dur="5.31">this banking system where this central</text>
  <text start="897.449" dur="4.711">bank can create currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="899.85" dur="4.14">and say here you go I just paid you off</text>
  <text start="902.16" dur="3.659">here&amp;#39;s another five hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="903.99" dur="4.38">here&amp;#39;s another million just do what I</text>
  <text start="905.819" dur="5.161">say it didn&amp;#39;t cost the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="908.37" dur="5.49">anything they created these funds out of</text>
  <text start="910.98" dur="5.269">thin air because what are the purpose</text>
  <text start="913.86" dur="5.669">does the central bank serve what they</text>
  <text start="916.249" dur="5.83">monitor and they regulate the economy no</text>
  <text start="919.529" dur="5.1">they don&amp;#39;t their mandate is not to</text>
  <text start="922.079" dur="5.401">regulate the economy it&amp;#39;s not to make it</text>
  <text start="924.629" dur="5.58">better for the people their mandate is</text>
  <text start="927.48" dur="5.549">to debt their mandate is to profit it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="930.209" dur="5.93">a private corporation we have a private</text>
  <text start="933.029" dur="7.321">corporation that is running this country</text>
  <text start="936.139" dur="5.86">why in the world would we even want this</text>
  <text start="940.35" dur="3.989">actually the founding fathers they</text>
  <text start="941.999" dur="4.65">didn&amp;#39;t want this this is what they</text>
  <text start="944.339" dur="4.11">fought against this is what the</text>
  <text start="946.649" dur="4.201">Revolutionary War was all about it</text>
  <text start="948.449" dur="4.95">wasn&amp;#39;t about tea it was about getting</text>
  <text start="950.85" dur="6.989">rid of the central banking system having</text>
  <text start="953.399" dur="6.961">the government coin money having the</text>
  <text start="957.839" dur="3.87">government and when I say government I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="960.36" dur="4.139">talking about We the People the</text>
  <text start="961.709" dur="6.87">government having we the people the</text>
  <text start="964.499" dur="7.83">government manage our finances create</text>
  <text start="968.579" dur="5.581">the currency without interest so this</text>
  <text start="972.329" dur="4.641">way when they have to balance the book</text>
  <text start="974.16" dur="5.219">the books they can do this very easily</text>
  <text start="976.97" dur="4.359">where all the money that is out in</text>
  <text start="979.379" dur="2.761">circulation if you brought it all back</text>
  <text start="981.329" dur="3.781">in</text>
  <text start="982.14" dur="5.31">the books would be balanced compared to</text>
  <text start="985.11" dur="5.49">the central banking system where they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="987.45" dur="5.699">own the government currency and they</text>
  <text start="990.6" dur="5.22">attach interest to it even if that</text>
  <text start="993.149" dur="5.94">currency comes back they&amp;#39;re still short</text>
  <text start="995.82" dur="6.24">the books can never be balanced and we</text>
  <text start="999.089" dur="5.461">can see right now this is the move that</text>
  <text start="1002.06" dur="4.62">Trump is making this is why he&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="1004.55" dur="4.26">these statements this is why during his</text>
  <text start="1006.68" dur="4.08">campaign he mentioned the Federal</text>
  <text start="1008.81" dur="5.279">Reserve and if you notice when Clinton</text>
  <text start="1010.76" dur="5.759">was having her debate with Trump she got</text>
  <text start="1014.089" dur="5.131">very angry about mentioning the Federal</text>
  <text start="1016.519" dur="5.07">Reserve well the whole reason for this</text>
  <text start="1019.22" dur="4.44">is to get rid of the central bank and I</text>
  <text start="1021.589" dur="3.541">believe in the background this is</text>
  <text start="1023.66" dur="3.06">exactly what he&amp;#39;s doing in these</text>
  <text start="1025.13" dur="5.01">individuals that are in his</text>
  <text start="1026.72" dur="5.88">administration well if you notice he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1030.14" dur="4.08">actually starting to say the opposite of</text>
  <text start="1032.6" dur="3.989">all these people and all these people</text>
  <text start="1034.22" dur="4.77">are trying to cover up what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="1036.589" dur="5.73">and I believe that they&amp;#39;re on to</text>
  <text start="1038.99" dur="5.849">opposites opposite sides here where</text>
  <text start="1042.319" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re on different missions many of</text>
  <text start="1044.839" dur="4.321">those individuals in this administration</text>
  <text start="1045.799" dur="6.721">are trying to work with the central bank</text>

  <text start="1055.28" dur="4.2">and these people that are there well</text>
  <text start="1057.44" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re going to be removed eventually</text>
  <text start="1059.48" dur="5.43">and as we move forward him taking down</text>
  <text start="1063.14" dur="4.35">the central bank which is a perfect time</text>
  <text start="1064.91" dur="3.87">when the economy collapses it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1067.49" dur="3.569">be a complete disaster because</text>
  <text start="1068.78" dur="4.26">everything has to reset everything has</text>
  <text start="1071.059" dur="4.921">to be started from scratch it has to be</text>
