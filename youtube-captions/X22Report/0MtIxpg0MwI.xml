  <text start="53.76" dur="5.22">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the</text>
  <text start="56.879" dur="5.851">x22 report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.98" dur="6.69">episode 1373 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.73" dur="5.34">September 7th 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="65.67" dur="4.68">episode is central banks decide that</text>
  <text start="68.07" dur="5.339">discontinuing stimulus will collapse the</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="5.309">economy let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.409" dur="4.32">collapse financial news now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="75.659" dur="5.011">lot going on weather-wise we know that</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="6.42">Harvey hit Texas we know that Irma is</text>
  <text start="80.67" dur="5.19">heading towards Florida and we realized</text>
  <text start="84.149" dur="4.201">that there are other hurricanes that are</text>
  <text start="85.86" dur="4.7">approaching and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="4.079">that the corporate media they are now</text>
  <text start="90.56" dur="3.58">maneuvering to say you know these</text>
  <text start="92.429" dur="4.351">hurricanes are causing problems in the</text>
  <text start="94.14" dur="5.369">economy and the latest thing is that</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="5.1">jobless claims they&amp;#39;ve spiked since 2005</text>
  <text start="99.509" dur="4.89">the most since 2005 and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="101.88" dur="5.4">this is part of Harvey the hangover of</text>
  <text start="104.399" dur="5.071">Harvey and right now what we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="4.769">at is that initial jobless claims they</text>
  <text start="109.47" dur="6.149">spiked to about 62,000 last week thanks</text>
  <text start="112.049" dur="4.74">to a 51,000 surge in Texas now this is</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="3.661">only temporary</text>
  <text start="116.789" dur="4.801">this is not going to be permanent as we</text>
  <text start="119.28" dur="4.229">can see that you know once Texas gets on</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="4.44">its feet and once the kurma passes</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="3.181">through Florida yes for a short period</text>
  <text start="126.03" dur="3.539">of time</text>
  <text start="126.69" dur="5.37">things will happen but again the initial</text>
  <text start="129.569" dur="5.881">jobless claims this has been manipulated</text>
  <text start="132.06" dur="5.16">all along there really is nothing true</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="4.05">about it just like the unemployment</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="4.68">numbers these are completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="3.959">and we could see right now that the</text>
  <text start="141.9" dur="2.79">initial jobless claims they have falling</text>
  <text start="143.459" dur="3.841">and falling and falling and if we look</text>
  <text start="144.69" dur="4.98">back in time every time initial jobless</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="5.159">claims got to this level or even lower</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="5.09">or a little bit higher what happens is</text>
  <text start="152.459" dur="4.441">the economy goes into a recession and</text>
  <text start="154.76" dur="3.309">basically this is where we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="2.729">because we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the</text>
  <text start="158.069" dur="3.211">economic indicators would be looking at</text>
  <text start="159.629" dur="3.841">what has been going on and we can see</text>
  <text start="161.28" dur="3.569">that retail well it is getting hammered</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="4.739">right now Toys R Us</text>
  <text start="164.849" dur="6.42">well they&amp;#39;ve hired a bankruptcy law firm</text>
  <text start="168.209" dur="6.961">and this law firm is Kirkland and Ellis</text>
  <text start="171.269" dur="6.211">and they are a bankruptcy and</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="4.77">restructuring practice and they are the</text>
  <text start="177.48" dur="4.739">leader in the booming bankruptcy and</text>
  <text start="179.94" dur="6.169">restructuring industry and right now</text>
  <text start="182.219" dur="5.311">Toys R Us has about 1694 stores globally</text>
  <text start="186.109" dur="4.421">they have about</text>
  <text start="187.53" dur="5.039">5.2 billion in long-term debt and what</text>
  <text start="190.53" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re looking at is that they are losing</text>
  <text start="192.569" dur="4.561">sales now again they have an online</text>
  <text start="195.33" dur="5.82">presence this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="197.13" dur="6.45">online sales what this has to do with is</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="5.58">that the people they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="203.58" dur="4.95">extra funds to spend on toys that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="5.19">basically what it is and right now sales</text>
  <text start="208.53" dur="4.95">they are down by 15% now the company</text>
  <text start="211.92" dur="3.21">needs to restructure its debts</text>
  <text start="213.48" dur="5.31">particularly 400 million that is coming</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="6.6">to in 2018 and a bankruptcy filing is</text>
  <text start="218.79" dur="6.3">one of the options and we see this</text>
  <text start="221.73" dur="4.59">happening to a lot of the retail market</text>
  <text start="225.09" dur="2.73">where stores are saying you know</text>
  <text start="226.32" dur="3.21">something we just can&amp;#39;t make ends meet</text>
  <text start="227.82" dur="4.35">we don&amp;#39;t have the sales and that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="5.82">thing that you can&amp;#39;t fake you can&amp;#39;t fake</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="5.55">sales it&amp;#39;s either you have sales or you</text>
  <text start="235.35" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t have sales earnings you know</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="4.739">buying back stocks and manipulating your</text>
  <text start="240.36" dur="4.92">accounting numbers you can do that but</text>
  <text start="242.459" dur="4.951">sales and revenue very difficult to do</text>
  <text start="245.28" dur="3.179">and this is where corporations are</text>
  <text start="247.41" dur="4.23">starting to get into trouble because</text>
  <text start="248.459" dur="6.09">their sales are just not there now we</text>
  <text start="251.64" dur="4.62">talked about the housing market and we</text>
  <text start="254.549" dur="3.571">know there&amp;#39;s many many bubbles all over</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="3.449">the place and the US Department of</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="4.59">Housing and Urban Development suggests</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="5.101">that you spend no more than 30 percent</text>
  <text start="262.71" dur="3.959">of your annual budget on housing costs</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="4.14">as it could put you and your family at</text>
  <text start="266.669" dur="4.831">greater risk of being unable to afford</text>
  <text start="268.95" dur="4.38">other necessities now this is the rule</text>
  <text start="271.5" dur="4.38">of thumb that you&amp;#39;re supposed to use and</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="5.28">we know that during the 2008 crisis well</text>
  <text start="275.88" dur="6.18">basically that didn&amp;#39;t happen people were</text>
  <text start="278.61" dur="5.82">basically spending a lot more their</text>
  <text start="282.06" dur="4.74">mortgages were very high and it seems</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="4.62">like we&amp;#39;re back in that same exact</text>
  <text start="286.8" dur="4.619">position when we look at this website</text>
  <text start="289.05" dur="4.65">how much net they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="291.419" dur="5.821">average American family spends roughly</text>
  <text start="293.7" dur="5.279">fifty seven thousand per year and have</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="4.35">thrown caution to the wind with housing</text>
  <text start="298.979" dur="5.31">costs eating up nearly 33 percent of</text>
  <text start="301.59" dur="6.24">their annual budget so they&amp;#39;re saying in</text>
  <text start="304.289" dur="6.031">all there are about 40 million houses or</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="4.86">about one third that are occupied by</text>
  <text start="310.32" dur="4.29">people who can&amp;#39;t afford them and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.69" dur="4.14">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="5.38">where are most of these homes located</text>
  <text start="316.83" dur="5.25">well they&amp;#39;re located in the 20</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="4.32">where they&amp;#39;re blowing up these bubbles</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="4.12">remember all those people that purchase</text>
  <text start="324.31" dur="5">their homes at the height of the market</text>
  <text start="326.2" dur="6.18">back in 2008 most of those people are</text>
  <text start="329.31" dur="4.96">underwater right now where they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="332.38" dur="3.18">reached the same exact level where they</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="3.27">purchased their house they have</text>
  <text start="335.56" dur="3.93">mortgages that are very very high and</text>
  <text start="337.54" dur="4.32">most of them are completely underwater</text>
  <text start="339.49" dur="4.71">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="5.82">we are headed down the same exact path</text>
  <text start="344.2" dur="5.16">now data from Harvard found that over 18</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="4.05">million households are currently stuck</text>
  <text start="349.36" dur="5.22">spending more than 50% of their annual</text>
  <text start="351.73" dur="6.09">income on housing which is up 35 percent</text>
  <text start="354.58" dur="5.94">compared to 2001 levels and we could see</text>
  <text start="357.82" dur="5.31">at this point that we are in a bit of</text>
  <text start="360.52" dur="5.34">trouble here because incomes are going</text>
  <text start="363.13" dur="4.17">down and as incomes continually slide</text>
  <text start="365.86" dur="4.02">and as more and more people lose their</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="4.53">jobs this is going to be a major problem</text>
  <text start="369.88" dur="5.25">now something very interesting about all</text>
  <text start="371.83" dur="4.83">this is this also has to do with renters</text>
  <text start="375.13" dur="3.69">because right now the report is saying</text>
  <text start="376.66" dur="4.47">that more than 11 million renter</text>
  <text start="378.82" dur="5.49">households pay at least half of their</text>
  <text start="381.13" dur="6.06">incomes for housing so we can see that</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="4.08">we are headed to a point where a lot of</text>
  <text start="387.19" dur="3.36">individuals they&amp;#39;re going to be in</text>
  <text start="388.39" dur="4.95">trouble just like they were back in 2008</text>
  <text start="390.55" dur="4.92">now the central banks they are looking</text>
  <text start="393.34" dur="3.39">at the economy we know we have very low</text>
  <text start="395.47" dur="3.48">interest rates we know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="396.73" dur="4.35">continuing with stimulus they have not</text>
  <text start="398.95" dur="5.19">stopped us whatsoever we know that the</text>
  <text start="401.08" dur="5.91">Fed has been adding to their balance</text>
  <text start="404.14" dur="5.61">sheet it&amp;#39;s approaching 20 trillion</text>
  <text start="406.99" dur="4.92">dollars and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="409.75" dur="5.04">the central banks they understand and</text>
  <text start="411.91" dur="4.98">they realize if they stop stimulus the</text>
  <text start="414.79" dur="3.39">economy is going to collapse and this is</text>
  <text start="416.89" dur="2.73">why they haven&amp;#39;t stopped it this is why</text>
  <text start="418.18" dur="2.58">they haven&amp;#39;t raised interest rates this</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="2.96">is why interest rates are in the</text>
  <text start="420.76" dur="6.33">negative territory now the easy being</text>
  <text start="422.58" dur="8.02">they have kept their three key rates and</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="6.12">their pace of QE completely unchanged</text>
  <text start="430.6" dur="4.2">and they&amp;#39;ve came they&amp;#39;ve come out with</text>
  <text start="433.21" dur="4.05">their statement and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="434.8" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re not going to stop this until</text>
  <text start="437.26" dur="3.81">maybe 2018 now of course they always</text>
  <text start="439.06" dur="3.48">push this off into the future making</text>
  <text start="441.07" dur="4.2">everyone think that this is when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="442.54" dur="6.33">going to stop it but they cannot stop</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="6.42">the pace of stimulus if the central</text>
  <text start="448.87" dur="4.96">banks start to raise rates and they stop</text>
  <text start="451.69" dur="6.31">the stimulus the economy</text>
  <text start="453.83" dur="6.6">is doomed they know this this is why it</text>
  <text start="458" dur="4.44">has not stopped this is why the Fed is</text>
  <text start="460.43" dur="3.87">continually adding to their balance</text>
  <text start="462.44" dur="4.47">sheet because they realize that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="464.3" dur="4.95">headed towards a major collapse of the</text>
  <text start="466.91" dur="4.14">system and if they stop stimulus now and</text>
  <text start="469.25" dur="2.79">everyone realizes that they&amp;#39;re stopping</text>
  <text start="471.05" dur="3.42">and they&amp;#39;re start raising interest rates</text>
  <text start="472.04" dur="4.23">and the economy collapses everyone is</text>
  <text start="474.47" dur="3.75">going to blame them so R at this point</text>
  <text start="476.27" dur="3.45">they understand what is happening now</text>
  <text start="478.22" dur="2.94">something very interesting now this is</text>
  <text start="479.72" dur="3.03">not published widely over the corporate</text>
  <text start="481.16" dur="4.23">media because they really don&amp;#39;t want you</text>
  <text start="482.75" dur="5.19">to know about gold and this is an</text>
  <text start="485.39" dur="5.49">insurance policy against the economy</text>
  <text start="487.94" dur="5.91">coming down about also the Fiat dollar</text>
  <text start="490.88" dur="6.09">collapsing but Goldman Sachs was out</text>
  <text start="493.85" dur="7.55">there and they are saying that physical</text>
  <text start="496.97" dur="7.41">gold is the true currency of last resort</text>
  <text start="501.4" dur="4.51">gold is a hedge against geopolitical</text>
  <text start="504.38" dur="5.49">risks when the event leads to a</text>
  <text start="505.91" dur="6.39">debasement of the dollar and basically</text>
  <text start="509.87" dur="4.23">what they are saying because they</text>
  <text start="512.3" dur="3.54">understand and all these banks</text>
  <text start="514.1" dur="5.04">understand that eventually what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="515.84" dur="5.67">to happen is that dollar is going to die</text>
  <text start="519.14" dur="4.89">and what I mean by that it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="521.51" dur="3.9">devalued and devalued and devalued and</text>
  <text start="524.03" dur="3.5">it will be worth absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="5.19">because when you have so much debt and</text>
  <text start="527.53" dur="5.98">dollars all in circulation you see</text>
  <text start="530.6" dur="5.52">inflation and that is worth noting what</text>
  <text start="533.51" dur="6.87">goes up well cryptocurrency can go up</text>
  <text start="536.12" dur="5.61">gold silver definitely will go up and we</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="2.49">can see this is exactly what is</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="3.3">happening now they&amp;#39;re saying that gold</text>
  <text start="542.87" dur="4.44">is increasing right now not because of</text>
  <text start="545.03" dur="3.75">the geopolitical events that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.31" dur="2.22">seeing now with North Korea and</text>
  <text start="548.78" dur="4.35">everything like that</text>
  <text start="549.53" dur="6.15">this has to do with the market mechanics</text>
  <text start="553.13" dur="5.88">the underlying economy so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.68" dur="5.31">seeing right now is these banks they</text>
  <text start="559.01" dur="3.78">understand they&amp;#39;ve been accumulating a</text>
  <text start="560.99" dur="4.02">lot of gold a lot of silver don&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="562.79" dur="4.98">fooled by this central banks have been</text>
  <text start="565.01" dur="4.56">accumulating gold and silver countries</text>
  <text start="567.77" dur="3.51">have been accumulating gold and silver</text>
  <text start="569.57" dur="4.71">because they realize they understand</text>
  <text start="571.28" dur="5.13">that the dollar is not going to last now</text>
  <text start="574.28" dur="3.99">James Rickards was out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="576.41" dur="3.93">been talking about crypto currencies and</text>
  <text start="578.27" dur="4.35">he&amp;#39;s saying that the central banks and</text>
  <text start="580.34" dur="4.53">countries they don&amp;#39;t want to put an end</text>
  <text start="582.62" dur="4.97">to the crypto currencies they want to</text>
  <text start="584.87" dur="4.31">control the crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="587.59" dur="3.3">he&amp;#39;s saying that there is every</text>
  <text start="589.18" dur="3.84">indication that governments regulators</text>
  <text start="590.89" dur="6.09">tax authorities and the global elite are</text>
  <text start="593.02" dur="5.49">moving in for the crypto kill he said</text>
  <text start="596.98" dur="4.26">the future of Bitcoin and all the other</text>
  <text start="598.51" dur="4.53">cryptocurrencies may be a dystopia in</text>
  <text start="601.24" dur="4.23">which Big Brother controls what&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="603.04" dur="4.14">the blockchain and decides when and how</text>
  <text start="605.47" dur="4.05">you can buy or sell anything and</text>
  <text start="607.18" dur="4.32">everything this is what they want to do</text>
  <text start="609.52" dur="4.67">because they understand that this is</text>
  <text start="611.5" dur="5.43">going to be the next generation of</text>
  <text start="614.19" dur="4.9">electronic currency and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="616.93" dur="4.95">this to be an open decentralized system</text>
  <text start="619.09" dur="4.34">they want control of the entire system</text>
  <text start="621.88" dur="4.68">they want control of the blockchain</text>
  <text start="623.43" dur="5.08">because governments central bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
