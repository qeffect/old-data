  <text start="141.7" dur="3.03">corporate media&amp;#39;s makin seem like oh</text>
  <text start="143.35" dur="3.27">this was all planned and things like</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="4.44">that what they were doing is they were</text>
  <text start="146.62" dur="4.23">going to see how it worked out in 2017</text>
  <text start="149.17" dur="4.83">they wanted to see how the holiday</text>
  <text start="150.85" dur="5.19">season panned out and it didn&amp;#39;t so</text>
  <text start="154" dur="5.989">Macy&amp;#39;s right now is going to be closing</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="7.41">another 30 stores this is confirmed and</text>
  <text start="159.989" dur="6.731">back in 2014 Macy&amp;#39;s had about 800 stores</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="6.36">they are down 200 stores right now and</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="4.829">we&amp;#39;re going to see other retailers say</text>
  <text start="169.81" dur="3.45">you know something we need to close our</text>
  <text start="171.549" dur="5.641">doors remember the numbers they were</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="5.34">giving us prior to the holiday season</text>
  <text start="177.19" dur="3.45">where they&amp;#39;re saying that retail isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="178.6" dur="4.469">doing incredible this is what the</text>
  <text start="180.64" dur="4.2">brick-and-mortar stores needed they</text>
  <text start="183.069" dur="3.511">needed this boost and they were saying</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="2.37">no look at this as four point something</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="4.53">percent</text>
  <text start="187.21" dur="6.45">well it wasn&amp;#39;t that it grew by force for</text>
  <text start="191.11" dur="4.53">something percent it was that it was a</text>
  <text start="193.66" dur="3.69">little bit higher than last year and I</text>
  <text start="195.64" dur="4.29">think when we calculated it out it was</text>
  <text start="197.35" dur="6.9">like maybe 0.4 percent higher than last</text>
  <text start="199.93" dur="6.06">year which means the entire sales</text>
  <text start="204.25" dur="6.09">structure for the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="205.99" dur="7.71">stores is absolutely awful and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="6.42">a little bit above what happened last</text>
  <text start="213.7" dur="5.55">year and last year 6,800 something</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="4.23">stores how to close now if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="219.25" dur="4.89">point four percent point five percent</text>
  <text start="220.99" dur="5.88">point nine percent over that percentage</text>
  <text start="224.14" dur="6.21">of last year is that enough to keep all</text>
  <text start="226.87" dur="5.67">the stores open most likely not most</text>
  <text start="230.35" dur="4.53">likely we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of returns</text>
  <text start="232.54" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re gonna see the actual numbers</text>
  <text start="234.88" dur="3.51">remember this number that they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="236.92" dur="3.2">us is from the credit card company and</text>
  <text start="238.39" dur="5.4">this occludes a lot of different things</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="6.16">the actual sales from the stores the</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="5.49">traffic that they had and their actual</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="5.01">profits that is going to show us what</text>
  <text start="249.28" dur="5.61">they actually did and when those numbers</text>
  <text start="251.29" dur="5.34">started to come out last year in 2017 we</text>
  <text start="254.89" dur="3.81">realized it was a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="256.63" dur="4.62">disaster and stores how to go bankrupt</text>
  <text start="258.7" dur="4.2">they had a closed down and when we</text>
  <text start="261.25" dur="3.78">looked at the percentages of sales going</text>
  <text start="262.9" dur="5.37">from brick-and-mortar to online it</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="6.72">didn&amp;#39;t match up yes online sales are</text>
  <text start="268.27" dur="4.62">going to grow as time goes on more and</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="4.89">more people are gonna be going online</text>
  <text start="272.89" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s easier to do but it&amp;#39;s still not the</text>
  <text start="276.64" dur="4.74">apples to apples transfer of everything</text>
  <text start="279.7" dur="4.23">going from brick-and-mortar to online</text>
  <text start="281.38" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s so far apart right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.93" dur="5.07">not even close and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="286.39" dur="5.91">that the entire system is breaking down</text>
  <text start="289" dur="5.1">and it&amp;#39;s accelerating of course nobody</text>
  <text start="292.3" dur="3.27">wants to admit to this because everyone</text>
  <text start="294.1" dur="4.74">is out there trying to convince us and</text>
  <text start="295.57" dur="5.43">this is the mandate of the Fed where</text>
  <text start="298.84" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;ll never admit that the economy is</text>
  <text start="301" dur="3.63">doing poorly and those people in</text>
  <text start="303.4" dur="3.72">government are not going to come out and</text>
  <text start="304.63" dur="4.47">say hey listen you know we&amp;#39;ve had a huge</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="4.77">amount of problems here that the economy</text>
  <text start="309.1" dur="4.56">is toast it&amp;#39;s collapsing because to be</text>
  <text start="311.89" dur="2.79">panic all over the place they&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="313.66" dur="3.93">ever going to do it they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="5.31">keep it going and making it look good</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="3.27">until the very end until the system</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="1.769">comes down</text>
  <text start="320.86" dur="3">and then they&amp;#39;ll blame it on something</text>
  <text start="321.759" dur="4.741">else because that&amp;#39;s what they love to do</text>
  <text start="323.86" dur="4.109">they love to blame whatever happens on</text>
  <text start="326.5" dur="3.419">something else if things go right they</text>
  <text start="327.969" dur="4.771">take credit if things go wrong they</text>
  <text start="329.919" dur="5.31">blame it on something else we see out in</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="4.47">the rental market well it looks like</text>
  <text start="335.229" dur="4.021">things are going south and this might be</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="4.38">signs that things aren&amp;#39;t going well now</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="4.74">remember go back to 2008 when people</text>
  <text start="341.59" dur="4.5">were losing their homes they were short</text>
  <text start="343.99" dur="4.919">sales foreclosures a lot of these people</text>
  <text start="346.09" dur="4.829">had to go and rent and rentals boomed</text>
  <text start="348.909" dur="4.591">during this period of time and rents</text>
  <text start="350.919" dur="5.22">went up now we&amp;#39;re starting to see rents</text>
  <text start="353.5" dur="5.159">come back down and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="356.139" dur="4.89">this in many different areas Seattle is</text>
  <text start="358.659" dur="3.78">cooling off New York City the second</text>
  <text start="361.029" dur="4.17">most expensive major rental market in</text>
  <text start="362.439" dur="4.621">the u.s. the median asking rent for</text>
  <text start="365.199" dur="4.62">one-bedroom Apartments fell by 3.7</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="5.669">percent from a year ago for two bedrooms</text>
  <text start="369.819" dur="4.47">it fell by five percent and we are</text>
  <text start="372.729" dur="5.19">starting to see this in other cities</text>
  <text start="374.289" dur="7.41">like San Francisco Honolulu Chicago</text>
  <text start="377.919" dur="5.821">they&amp;#39;re all coming down Miami we see</text>
  <text start="381.699" dur="3.96">rents are coming down by negative two</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="4.2">point eight percent Chicago is fifteen</text>
  <text start="385.659" dur="5.281">point six percent San Francisco&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="387.94" dur="5.52">point nine percent we&amp;#39;re seeing Miami</text>
  <text start="390.94" dur="4.68">coming down by four percent Honolulu by</text>
  <text start="393.46" dur="4.59">seven point one percent and when we look</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="5.28">at this we could see hmm maybe something</text>
  <text start="398.05" dur="6.329">is going on here and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="400.9" dur="5.22">see that the push to keep these bubbles</text>
  <text start="404.379" dur="3.241">up in the real estate market in all</text>
  <text start="406.12" dur="3.569">these 20 cities that Case Shiller looks</text>
  <text start="407.62" dur="4.74">at these are also starting to have</text>
  <text start="409.689" dur="5.73">trouble where they&amp;#39;re having a difficult</text>
  <text start="412.36" dur="5.339">time keeping these bubbles as high as</text>
  <text start="415.419" dur="3.601">they they are right now especially if</text>
  <text start="417.699" dur="3.451">the Fed is going to start raising</text>
  <text start="419.02" dur="4.5">interest rates it&amp;#39;s going to throw a lot</text>
  <text start="421.15" dur="4.319">of people out of the market who would</text>
  <text start="423.52" dur="3.449">normally buy a house actually what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="425.469" dur="2.76">seeing over there a period of time</text>
  <text start="426.969" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that have</text>
  <text start="428.229" dur="4.47">already been out of the market and this</text>
  <text start="430.539" dur="3.69">is why mortgage applications really</text>
  <text start="432.699" dur="3.601">haven&amp;#39;t gone anywhere because most of</text>
  <text start="434.229" dur="4.081">the investments in real estate are</text>
  <text start="436.3" dur="4.2">speculators they&amp;#39;re hedge funds</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="4.079">investment companies foreign buyers and</text>
  <text start="440.5" dur="4.199">they&amp;#39;re buying you know two three four</text>
  <text start="442.389" dur="5.041">thousands of homes and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="444.699" dur="4.2">going to happen is that these</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="3.479">speculators are going to disappear just</text>
  <text start="448.899" dur="4.05">like they did in 2008 and you can have</text>
  <text start="450.909" dur="3.82">all these homes and all these condos</text>
  <text start="452.949" dur="3.52">they&amp;#39;re just going to be open</text>
  <text start="454.729" dur="4.291">and the same thing is going to happen</text>
  <text start="456.469" dur="3.51">and we&amp;#39;re heading in that direction now</text>
  <text start="459.02" dur="2.94">remember they&amp;#39;ve been pumping the</text>
  <text start="459.979" dur="5.071">bubbles up in these 20 cities the rest</text>
  <text start="461.96" dur="5.759">of the US well the rest of the US real</text>
  <text start="465.05" dur="5.369">estate market it is starting to fall</text>
  <text start="467.719" dur="5.07">apart houses aren&amp;#39;t hitting the height</text>
  <text start="470.419" dur="4.71">of where they were in 2008 in many</text>
  <text start="472.789" dur="5.641">places those prices are much much lower</text>
  <text start="475.129" dur="6.06">traffic isn&amp;#39;t as abundant as it was as</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="5.31">it once was and people are are lowering</text>
  <text start="481.189" dur="4.1">their prices just to get people to come</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="4.5">out and take a look at their homes and</text>
  <text start="485.289" dur="4.9">we can see that the retail market the</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="3.63">housing market has interest rates rise</text>
  <text start="490.189" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s going to put it&amp;#39;s going to have an</text>
  <text start="491.87" dur="3.509">effect on the student loan market it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="493.939" dur="3.75">gonna have an effect on the auto loan</text>
  <text start="495.379" dur="6.15">market and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of</text>
  <text start="497.689" dur="5.28">things change we saw this prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="501.529" dur="3.241">the Fed was doing the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="502.969" dur="3.78">they were raising interest rates</text>
  <text start="504.77" dur="3.449">very very slowly right at that time a</text>
  <text start="506.749" dur="3.63">lot of people had adjustable rate</text>
  <text start="508.219" dur="4.141">mortgages they felt the effect very</text>
  <text start="510.379" dur="3.72">quickly and they said oh my god I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="512.36" dur="3.75">afford my mortgage I&amp;#39;m just leaving the</text>
  <text start="514.099" dur="3.36">house as interest rates kept on moving</text>
  <text start="516.11" dur="3.809">up and up and up and they tried to lock</text>
  <text start="517.459" dur="3.99">in and it got out of control the same</text>
  <text start="519.919" dur="2.581">thing is happening right now not as many</text>
  <text start="521.449" dur="2.82">people have the adjustable rate</text>
  <text start="522.5" dur="6.18">mortgages but it&amp;#39;s gonna throw a lot of</text>
  <text start="524.269" dur="6.031">people out of the auto loan industry</text>
  <text start="528.68" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s going to throw a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="530.3" dur="4.56">of the housing loan industry where they</text>
  <text start="532.76" dur="4.98">can&amp;#39;t get these loans it&amp;#39;ll be very very</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="5.52">difficult because as interest rates move</text>
  <text start="537.74" dur="5.13">up you need to make a certain amount of</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="4.5">money to afford the house because when</text>
  <text start="542.87" dur="4.019">interest rates are low you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="544.88" dur="4.23">make as much money to afford the house</text>
  <text start="546.889" dur="5.551">that you want so we&amp;#39;re gonna see things</text>
  <text start="549.11" dur="6.209">change rapidly now the central banks</text>
  <text start="552.44" dur="4.55">they are trapped and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="555.319" dur="4.5">Charles Hughes Smith he wrote an article</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="5.26">why the financial system will break you</text>
  <text start="559.819" dur="5.13">can&amp;#39;t normalize markets and depend on</text>
  <text start="562.25" dur="6.06">extreme monetary stimulus he said in a</text>
  <text start="564.949" dur="5.521">nutshell central banks are promising to</text>
  <text start="568.31" dur="4.139">normalize their monetary policy extremes</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="5.369">in 2018 but there&amp;#39;s a problem with all</text>
  <text start="572.449" dur="5.551">this you can&amp;#39;t normalize markets that</text>
  <text start="575.839" dur="3.331">are now entirely dependent on extremes</text>
  <text start="578" dur="5.339">of monetary stimulus</text>
  <text start="579.17" dur="6.479">you can&amp;#39;t fix an economy where the</text>
  <text start="583.339" dur="5.12">entire economy is built on an illusion</text>
  <text start="585.649" dur="6.901">the recovery was built on an illusion</text>
  <text start="588.459" dur="6.19">so remember back in 2008 in response to</text>
  <text start="592.55" dur="3.659">the global financial crisis the central</text>
  <text start="594.649" dur="3.62">banks they lowered their interest rates</text>
  <text start="596.209" dur="4.861">to near zero in some places negative</text>
  <text start="598.269" dur="4.931">they boost private sector lending</text>
  <text start="601.07" dur="3.87">increased liquidity to enable private</text>

  <text start="790.18" dur="5.11">we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past when they raise</text>
  <text start="792.47" dur="5.789">the rates it didn&amp;#39;t work everything fell</text>
  <text start="795.29" dur="6">apart why because most of it was built</text>
  <text start="798.259" dur="5.971">on an illusion the subprime security</text>
  <text start="801.29" dur="6.96">built on an illusion it was fake</text>

  <text start="808.25" dur="4.98">believe they were because we were told</text>
  <text start="810.11" dur="4.349">they were the same thing today what the</text>

  <text start="820.67" dur="4.74">going to come down and I think want that</text>
  <text start="823.43" dur="3.959">the reason they&amp;#39;re raising the rates is</text>
  <text start="825.41" dur="4.64">so they can bring them back down again</text>
  <text start="827.389" dur="5.37">think about what they did prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="830.05" dur="4.839">the rates were low they started to bring</text>
  <text start="832.759" dur="3.741">them up and they reached a point where</text>
  <text start="834.889" dur="4.711">everything started to fall apart when</text>
  <text start="836.5" dur="5.379">everything started to fall apart they</text>
  <text start="839.6" dur="4.409">started to lower the rates again and</text>
  <text start="841.879" dur="4.89">they kept lowering them it didn&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="844.009" dur="5.611">because they already ignited the fuse</text>
  <text start="846.769" dur="4.201">and it was burning and people were</text>
  <text start="849.62" dur="3.51">getting out of the way people were</text>
  <text start="850.97" dur="3.72">abandoning their houses and businesses</text>
  <text start="853.13" dur="2.88">were coming down but</text>
  <text start="854.69" dur="2.37">they kept lowering the rates because</text>
  <text start="856.01" dur="3.3">they didn&amp;#39;t care what happened in the</text>
  <text start="857.06" dur="4.05">economy as long as they can bring the</text>
  <text start="859.31" dur="4.02">rates to where they needed to go because</text>
  <text start="861.11" dur="3.93">they knew they needed to do this I think</text>
  <text start="863.33" dur="3.96">the same thing is happening I think</text>
  <text start="865.04" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re bringing the rates up as far as</text>
  <text start="867.29" dur="4.71">they can get them so they can say when</text>
  <text start="869.3" dur="5.24">everything starts to fall apart they</text>
  <text start="872" dur="5.04">could say hey we need to bring the rates</text>
  <text start="874.54" dur="5.62">low and I think they&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="877.04" dur="5.64">negative at this point and we can see</text>
  <text start="880.16" dur="4.17">that this is all in preparation for the</text>
  <text start="882.68" dur="3.72">collapse now we know that everything is</text>
  <text start="884.33" dur="3.87">moving away from the West and moving to</text>
  <text start="886.4" dur="3.9">the east we see that China and Russian</text>
  <text start="888.2" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing and remember this</text>
  <text start="890.3" dur="5.91">is the central bank just moving their</text>
  <text start="892.73" dur="4.98">base of operation to someplace else to</text>
  <text start="896.21" dur="3.84">restart their system because their old</text>
  <text start="897.71" dur="4.26">system is crashing of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="900.05" dur="3.27">gonna blame this on something else they</text>
  <text start="901.97" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t want people to know that their old</text>
  <text start="903.32" dur="3.66">system is crashing they&amp;#39;ll say crash</text>
  <text start="905.12" dur="4.11">because it may be Bitcoin because of</text>
  <text start="906.98" dur="4.86">some type of distraction maybe war or</text>
  <text start="909.23" dur="4.65">some type of an event but whatever they</text>
  <text start="911.84" dur="4.35">do they&amp;#39;re not gonna take the blame for</text>
  <text start="913.88" dur="5.46">this and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="916.19" dur="6.06">there is going to be a push to take</text>
  <text start="919.34" dur="4.23">control of the cryptocurrency market and</text>
  <text start="922.25" dur="3.24">I think the central bankers are making</text>
  <text start="923.57" dur="4.64">this push right now where they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="925.49" dur="6.21">to take control and force everyone into</text>
  <text start="928.21" dur="6.88">what they want them to use just like</text>
  <text start="931.7" dur="5.37">back in 1913 they wanted everyone into</text>
  <text start="935.09" dur="5.22">their currency that they wanted to</text>
  <text start="937.07" dur="5.46">create today they want the same thing</text>
  <text start="940.31" dur="6.12">and the only way to do this is to create</text>
  <text start="942.53" dur="5.1">laws to force people into it because you</text>
  <text start="946.43" dur="3.12">can&amp;#39;t just tell the Cinch bank just</text>
  <text start="947.63" dur="4.74">can&amp;#39;t come out and say hey you need to</text>
  <text start="949.55" dur="4.29">use our Fed coin or our utility coin no</text>
  <text start="952.37" dur="5.16">they need governments around the world</text>
  <text start="953.84" dur="5.85">to tell their people to do this and the</text>
  <text start="957.53" dur="4.86">only way to do this is to scare them</text>
  <text start="959.69" dur="7.95">this is their tactic they use crash the</text>
  <text start="962.39" dur="7.98">economy crash Bitcoin crash the crypto</text>
  <text start="967.64" dur="4.86">system and say see what happens it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="970.37" dur="4.26">very volatile it&amp;#39;s very dangerous</text>
  <text start="972.5" dur="4.589">without the central bank&amp;#39;s managing it</text>
  <text start="974.63" dur="3.81">and I think this is the move they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="977.089" dur="3.331">gonna make now is this going to work I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="978.44" dur="3.6">not saying it&amp;#39;s going to work but this</text>
  <text start="980.42" dur="3.66">is the tactic they use we see already</text>
  <text start="982.04" dur="5.04">out in China the PBOC</text>
  <text start="984.08" dur="3.78">call for rectifying irregularities</text>
  <text start="987.08" dur="4.499">intellect</text>
  <text start="987.86" dur="5.61">use of some Bitcoin mining fields and</text>
  <text start="991.579" dur="6.301">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="993.47" dur="7.94">limit the amount of power the miners can</text>
  <text start="997.88" dur="6.18">use now think about it the entire</text>
  <text start="1001.41" dur="5.98">operation of mining Bitcoin and other</text>
  <text start="1004.06" dur="5.61">coins they&amp;#39;re in these huge server rooms</text>
  <text start="1007.39" dur="5.37">where these servers are working and it</text>
  <text start="1009.67" dur="6.75">uses a certain number of uses</text>
  <text start="1012.76" dur="7.199">electricity to generate and to operate</text>
  <text start="1016.42" dur="5.37">these servers if countries even here in</text>
  <text start="1019.959" dur="4.531">the United States put a regulation in</text>
  <text start="1021.79" dur="6.889">place where they limit the amount of</text>
  <text start="1024.49" dur="8.599">lectricity you can use well guess what</text>
  <text start="1028.679" dur="9.431">they&amp;#39;re able to stop the production of</text>
  <text start="1033.089" dur="6.791">Bitcoin - like corn or anything and you</text>
  <text start="1038.11" dur="4.29">can see that what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1039.88" dur="5.16">is they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out ways to</text>
  <text start="1042.4" dur="6.149">regulate and that&amp;#39;s the key word</text>
  <text start="1045.04" dur="5.55">regulate they want regulations to</text>
  <text start="1048.549" dur="4.62">control what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="1050.59" dur="6">and we can see that they might even tax</text>
  <text start="1053.169" dur="6.031">and again this is the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1056.59" dur="4.68">looking to take control of the currency</text>
  <text start="1059.2" dur="3.719">system I&amp;#39;m not saying this is exactly</text>
  <text start="1061.27" dur="3.6">what&amp;#39;s going to happen or they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1062.919" dur="3.691">succeed in what they&amp;#39;re trying to do but</text>
  <text start="1064.87" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re gonna give it their all to try</text>
  <text start="1066.61" dur="4.5">to do this hopefully the people say no</text>
  <text start="1069.16" dur="3.63">we don&amp;#39;t want this we don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="1071.11" dur="4.5">central bank&amp;#39;s getting their fingers</text>
  <text start="1072.79" dur="4.98">into this but again it all depends on</text>
  <text start="1075.61" dur="4.08">those people in government those people</text>
  <text start="1077.77" dur="3.69">in government when the central bank was</text>
  <text start="1079.69" dur="5.79">trying to get into the system they were</text>
  <text start="1081.46" dur="8.25">paid off and they allowed the central</text>
  <text start="1085.48" dur="6.6">banks to get into our system and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1089.71" dur="5.28">had it since 1913 yes we&amp;#39;ve had other</text>
  <text start="1092.08" dur="5.4">central banks but Andrew Jackson removed</text>
  <text start="1094.99" dur="6.02">the last one and hopefully this time</text>
  <text start="1097.48" dur="7.62">around they don&amp;#39;t have the ability to</text>
  <text start="1101.01" dur="6.159">get the government people to pass these</text>
  <text start="1105.1" dur="5.01">laws the people are going to have to</text>
  <text start="1107.169" dur="5.071">speak up and say no we don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="1110.11" dur="5.309">to happen we don&amp;#39;t need these laws and</text>
  <text start="1112.24" dur="4.56">hopefully other countries do this so</text>
  <text start="1115.419" dur="4.231">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1116.8" dur="4.199">getting everything prepared for the</text>
  <text start="1119.65" dur="3.569">system</text>
  <text start="1120.999" dur="3.09">to come down they want control of the</text>
  <text start="1123.219" dur="3.06">cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="1124.089" dur="5.22">they want their system moved from the</text>
  <text start="1126.279" dur="5.67">west to the east they want everything in</text>
  <text start="1129.309" dur="5.37">place and it looks like they&amp;#39;re almost</text>
  <text start="1131.949" dur="5.04">there we&amp;#39;re heading to this time period</text>
  <text start="1134.679" dur="4.44">of where they&amp;#39;re gonna have no choice</text>
  <text start="1136.989" dur="3.84">but to eventually bring it down because</text>
  <text start="1139.119" dur="3.33">if they don&amp;#39;t bring it down it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1140.829" dur="2.94">come down on its own and they won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1142.449" dur="3.42">able to control it and they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="1143.769" dur="4.65">losing control they like having full</text>
  <text start="1145.869" dur="3.99">control of when these things happen and</text>
  <text start="1148.419" dur="4.29">it looks like they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="1149.859" dur="4.77">keep this afloat for this period of time</text>
  <text start="1152.709" dur="5.01">until they can figure out a way to</text>
  <text start="1154.629" dur="4.83">distract everyone away from the real</text>
  <text start="1157.719" dur="3.24">reason of why the economy is coming down</text>
  <text start="1159.459" dur="4.71">and that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s their system</text>
  <text start="1160.959" dur="5.25">their system always comes down after a</text>
  <text start="1164.169" dur="4.2">certain number of years they can&amp;#39;t keep</text>
  <text start="1166.209" dur="3.72">it operational so they have to restart</text>
  <text start="1168.369" dur="3.9">it and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="1169.929" dur="4.11">now we&amp;#39;re at that time period so no</text>
