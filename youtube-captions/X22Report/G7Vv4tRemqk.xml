  <text start="499.21" dur="3.99">gonna be getting to that in just a</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="4.83">minute but the people of Iran they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="3.21">preparing for these sanctions now what</text>
  <text start="505.48" dur="2.7">are they doing that they takin their</text>
  <text start="506.41" dur="4.62">currency are they hiding under the</text>
  <text start="508.18" dur="5.87">mattress no they&amp;#39;re taking their</text>
  <text start="511.03" dur="7.64">currency and they&amp;#39;re turning it into</text>
  <text start="514.05" dur="7.15">precious metals including bars coins</text>
  <text start="518.67" dur="5.95">jewelry whatever they can get their</text>

  <text start="537.43" dur="5.58">to 1025 per coin people are changing</text>
  <text start="541.03" dur="4.71">their money into gold because it is real</text>
  <text start="543.01" dur="4.92">it is a reliable investment commodity</text>
  <text start="545.74" dur="5.07">and they know you really can&amp;#39;t sanction</text>
  <text start="547.93" dur="5.22">gold because it&amp;#39;s accepted everywhere</text>

  <text start="558.85" dur="4.92">these sanctions now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="560.59" dur="6.33">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="563.77" dur="6.78">hours before the renewed sanctions on</text>
  <text start="566.92" dur="6.93">Iran are set to snap back the Iranian</text>
  <text start="570.55" dur="6.51">president Hassan rouhani has announced</text>

  <text start="579.13" dur="5.76">step up the practical action to save the</text>
  <text start="581.83" dur="6.059">2015 nuclear deal now remember trump was</text>
  <text start="584.89" dur="5.999">out there saying that he would like to</text>
  <text start="587.889" dur="4.68">work on a new deal and Rohini is out</text>
  <text start="590.889" dur="4.771">there saying that Iran had always</text>
  <text start="592.569" dur="4.83">welcomed new negotiations but Washington</text>
  <text start="595.66" dur="3.9">would have to take clear steps to prove</text>
  <text start="597.399" dur="6.601">they can restore trust after we nicking</text>
  <text start="599.56" dur="6.329">on the 2015 jcpoa deal and bolton of</text>
  <text start="604" dur="3.72">course is out there saying if iran were</text>
  <text start="605.889" dur="4.351">really serious they&amp;#39;d come to the table</text>
  <text start="607.72" dur="5.909">we&amp;#39;ll find out whether they are or not</text>
  <text start="610.24" dur="6.209">and it seems like trump is using the</text>
  <text start="613.629" dur="4.71">same exact method that he used with kim</text>
  <text start="616.449" dur="4.38">jeong-hoon and i think eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.339" dur="5.821">going to happen here is that the iranian</text>
  <text start="620.829" dur="5.331">government is going to come to the table</text>
  <text start="624.16" dur="5.729">and they&amp;#39;re going to hash out a</text>
  <text start="626.16" dur="6.31">completely new deal do I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="629.889" dur="4.531">going to be regime change no that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="632.47" dur="3.659">the mo of the Trump administration this</text>
  <text start="634.42" dur="4.709">is not how they work because why would</text>
  <text start="636.129" dur="5.25">they have regime change at this point it</text>
  <text start="639.129" dur="4.56">would make no sense whatsoever it would</text>
  <text start="641.379" dur="4.56">start a war Russia would get involved</text>
  <text start="643.689" dur="3.061">China would get involved and you can see</text>
  <text start="645.939" dur="2.361">with North Korea</text>
  <text start="646.75" dur="4.439">there was no regime change there</text>
  <text start="648.3" dur="6.07">Venezuela where we had an attack on</text>
  <text start="651.189" dur="6.15">Maduro why would the u.s. not have</text>
  <text start="654.37" dur="6.329">regime change in North Korea no regime</text>
  <text start="657.339" dur="6.451">change in Syria but have it in Venezuela</text>
  <text start="660.699" dur="5.49">no there was another force that was</text>
  <text start="663.79" dur="5.52">pushing that agenda there because they</text>
  <text start="666.189" dur="4.59">took an opportunity where Maduro was out</text>
  <text start="669.31" dur="3.87">in the open and they thought they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="670.779" dur="3.841">able to get him because as we know the</text>
