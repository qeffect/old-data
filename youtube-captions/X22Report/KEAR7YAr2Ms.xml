  <text start="102.15" dur="6.09">also understand the economy is</text>
  <text start="104.48" dur="5.2">deteriorating and the government&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t have the ability to bring in the</text>
  <text start="109.68" dur="4.62">revenue to pay down the debt and as the</text>
  <text start="112.83" dur="4.38">debt continually grows and it&amp;#39;s growing</text>
  <text start="114.3" dur="4.29">very very quickly it&amp;#39;s getting more and</text>
  <text start="117.21" dur="6.48">more difficult because what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="7.139">is as the debt grows governments cannot</text>
  <text start="123.69" dur="5.28">operate they need to borrow more money</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="6.12">they need more austerity and the</text>
  <text start="128.97" dur="5.849">situation gets worse and worse as time</text>
  <text start="131.849" dur="6.331">goes on and we realize that the central</text>
  <text start="134.819" dur="7.741">bankers their ultimate plan is to have</text>
  <text start="138.18" dur="7.76">the people bail them out pay down the</text>
  <text start="142.56" dur="7.289">debt not all of it some of it and</text>
  <text start="145.94" dur="6.519">they&amp;#39;ve tried different plans but</text>
  <text start="149.849" dur="5.041">something very interesting is happening</text>
  <text start="152.459" dur="5.82">in Greece and before I mention that we</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="8.55">have to remember Cyprus remember when</text>
  <text start="158.279" dur="8.161">Cyprus was in trouble and the banks</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;re defaulting and they had to go in</text>
  <text start="166.44" dur="5.7">to the banks to prop up the system and</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;ve confiscated the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="3.93">currency they had capital controls</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="3.66">everything went on a bank holiday and</text>
  <text start="176.07" dur="3.81">the capital controls lasted for more</text>
  <text start="178.02" dur="5.04">than a year actually there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="5.01">capital controls in Cyprus and people</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="3.87">weren&amp;#39;t able to access their money</text>
  <text start="184.89" dur="3.3">transfer their money or anything like</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="4.71">that and everyone knew it was a test</text>
  <text start="188.19" dur="6.03">case this was a test case for balance</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="5.04">because we knew there was a bail-in</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="7.22">document that was created i believe it</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="8.85">was 2012 between the FDIC the Fed and</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="6.04">the Bank of England and they created it</text>
  <text start="205.53" dur="3.96">and then all of a sudden we had</text>
  <text start="207.48" dur="4.68">something happen in Cyprus and then all</text>
  <text start="209.49" dur="5.4">of a sudden Canada wanted it Europe</text>
  <text start="212.16" dur="4.17">wanted it and it spread because they</text>
  <text start="214.89" dur="4.62">realize that governments aren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="216.33" dur="5.16">bail them out now Christine Lagarde has</text>
  <text start="219.51" dur="3.48">come out and said you know to get rid of</text>
  <text start="221.49" dur="3.3">this debt we need to go to the people</text>
  <text start="222.99" dur="4.38">and they&amp;#39;re going to have to sacrifice</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="7.5">with a wealth tax this is one of their</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="7.5">plans now when we look at Greece it</text>
  <text start="232.29" dur="5.82">looks like they might be starting this</text>
  <text start="234.87" dur="7.98">or testing it out to see how the people</text>
  <text start="238.11" dur="7.46">react the greek finance ministry well</text>
  <text start="242.85" dur="6.75">they confirm some details on a</text>
  <text start="245.57" dur="6.25">long-planned registration of all kinds</text>
  <text start="249.6" dur="8.37">of private wealth that will go into</text>
  <text start="251.82" dur="8.81">effect februari of 2017 more than eight</text>
  <text start="257.97" dur="6.18">million five hundred thousand taxpayers</text>
  <text start="260.63" dur="7.47">registered in greece will be called on</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="10.23">to declare all movable and immovable</text>
  <text start="268.1" dur="9.22">assets their total wealth and even cash</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="7.95">they possess under the mattress hidden</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="7.74">in floorboards in safes even if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="8.04">below a hundred euro down to the one</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="9.75">euro they need to declare it and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="290.37" dur="6.9">have to register all of it and</text>
  <text start="294.81" dur="6.41">all this information is going to be</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="6.96">uploaded to the tax authorities website</text>
  <text start="301.22" dur="7.41">so you have real estate declared income</text>
  <text start="304.23" dur="9.99">income from rents vehicles cash gold</text>
  <text start="308.63" dur="10.75">silver jewelry antiques paintings you</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="7.65">name it they want to know about it so</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="6.81">then you have to start to think why do</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="6.84">they need all of this well it looks like</text>
  <text start="326.19" dur="7.199">it&amp;#39;s going to be what they call a</text>
  <text start="328.71" dur="10.41">one-time wealth tax so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="333.389" dur="11.631">looking to do is find as much wealth as</text>
  <text start="339.12" dur="8.22">they possibly can to pay down the entire</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="3.97">debt now I&amp;#39;m not saying they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="4.92">pay it off completely but they need</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="7.5">enough to start paying it off and</text>
  <text start="352.26" dur="6.6">they&amp;#39;re going to the people so the tax</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="4.049">is going to be on the middle upper class</text>
  <text start="358.86" dur="6.27">most likely it will then trickle down to</text>
  <text start="360.539" dur="7.461">the poor and the tax that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="365.13" dur="6.15">to use the rate they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="368" dur="7.32">it&amp;#39;s going to be a blended rate of about</text>
  <text start="371.28" dur="7.199">twenty eight point seven percent and</text>
  <text start="375.32" dur="8.099">starting to look like Greece is going to</text>
  <text start="378.479" dur="11.151">be the guinea pig for this wealth tax</text>
  <text start="383.419" dur="9.551">system and here we are because</text>
  <text start="389.63" dur="6.37">governments they have spent and spent</text>
  <text start="392.97" dur="6.41">and spent the debts of these countries</text>
  <text start="396" dur="7.65">are very very high the world debt is</text>
  <text start="399.38" dur="6.25">extremely high and the central banks</text>
  <text start="403.65" dur="4.079">they&amp;#39;re not just going to get rid of</text>
  <text start="405.63" dur="5.13">them they want the people to sacrifice</text>
  <text start="407.729" dur="8.581">they want the people to come up with the</text>
  <text start="410.76" dur="7.05">funds to pay for their debt problem just</text>
  <text start="416.31" dur="4.109">like they want the people to bail out</text>
  <text start="417.81" dur="5.55">the banks it always comes back to the</text>
  <text start="420.419" dur="4.731">people and this is why many people are</text>
  <text start="423.36" dur="5.1">out there and I&amp;#39;m doing this right now</text>
  <text start="425.15" dur="6.46">where you only keep enough in the</text>
  <text start="428.46" dur="5.22">to pay your bills the rest is hidden</text>
  <text start="431.61" dur="4.14">someplace else now I know they want you</text>
  <text start="433.68" dur="4.709">to count up the people in Greece they</text>
  <text start="435.75" dur="4.08">want them to count up the currency under</text>
  <text start="438.389" dur="2.521">the mattress to gold and silver but you</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="3.63">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen just like</text>
  <text start="440.91" dur="4.68">during the Depression where people were</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="5.76">asked to turn in their gold many people</text>
  <text start="445.59" dur="4.979">did not many people hid their gold the</text>
  <text start="449.22" dur="3.27">same things going to happen in Greece</text>
  <text start="450.569" dur="4.38">many people are going to say this is all</text>
  <text start="452.49" dur="5.579">I have in the bank that&amp;#39;s all I have you</text>
  <text start="454.949" dur="6.451">can you can tax that and this is why the</text>
  <text start="458.069" dur="6.451">Greek people in the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="5.19">entire election and everything going</text>
  <text start="464.52" dur="3.78">forward with tsipras this is why they</text>
  <text start="466.59" dur="3.09">ran to the bank center their currency</text>
  <text start="468.3" dur="3.06">out of the bank because they realize</text>
  <text start="469.68" dur="3.87">that something was about to happen</text>
  <text start="471.36" dur="4.11">because the current the country cannot</text>
  <text start="473.55" dur="4.44">continue on the way it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.47" dur="4.919">completely impossible and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="477.99" dur="6.03">to see that it really can I mean there</text>
  <text start="480.389" dur="7.171">are too far into a collapse scenario</text>
  <text start="484.02" dur="8.149">that there&amp;#39;s really no way of getting</text>
  <text start="487.56" dur="8.4">out of this situation Japan right now</text>
  <text start="492.169" dur="9.011">their economy has slowed in April to</text>
  <text start="495.96" dur="8.549">June and they have weak exports their</text>
  <text start="501.18" dur="6.15">recovery is not working whatsoever which</text>

  <text start="507.33" dur="5.899">these countries is not working and what</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="10.289">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that Greece</text>
  <text start="513.229" dur="12.041">Japan Germany France Italy UK Canada the</text>

  <text start="539.88" dur="6.959">by seventy percent of spending it is not</text>
  <text start="543.57" dur="6.18">doing well because when you look at this</text>
  <text start="546.839" dur="4.801">you have to ask yourself the government</text>
  <text start="549.75" dur="5.85">continually is out there telling us how</text>

  <text start="567.69" dur="8.01">discretionary items like dining out</text>
  <text start="570.98" dur="7.87">imploding right now the consumer is not</text>
  <text start="575.7" dur="7.17">strong consumer spending is weak and</text>
  <text start="578.85" dur="8.19">getting weaker spending using credit or</text>
  <text start="582.87" dur="7.8">loans that&amp;#39;s not real spending that that</text>
  <text start="587.04" dur="6.33">is debt you use that because you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="590.67" dur="5.34">have the funds so when we look at this</text>
  <text start="593.37" dur="7.62">people today because they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="596.01" dur="7.59">their jobs they don&amp;#39;t have the jobs they</text>
  <text start="600.99" dur="5.159">can&amp;#39;t find the jobs so they don&amp;#39;t have</text>

  <text start="610.769" dur="6.541">happening right now and since retail is</text>
  <text start="614.13" dur="7.889">declining manufacturers don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="617.31" dur="7.469">produce and we&amp;#39;re seeing this here in</text>
  <text start="622.019" dur="5.551">the US we had a couple of dead cat</text>

  <text start="805.08" dur="8.35">making deals with other countries their</text>
  <text start="808.99" dur="6.15">economies are moving along even though</text>
  <text start="813.43" dur="3.48">the corporate media continually tells us</text>
  <text start="815.14" dur="3.89">how bad everything is but you have to</text>
  <text start="816.91" dur="4.8">remember what they&amp;#39;re doing they are</text>
  <text start="819.03" dur="5.71">continually purchasing a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="821.71" dur="6.51">gold they&amp;#39;re continually out there</text>

  <text start="837.429" dur="8.491">country in the world to see a bail-in</text>
  <text start="839.639" dur="9.971">type of scenario and the reason why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="845.92" dur="5.399">saying this is that the fbd one of</text>
  <text start="849.61" dur="3.99">Ireland&amp;#39;s largest insurance companies</text>
  <text start="851.319" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;ve been moving cash out of the</text>
  <text start="853.6" dur="6.239">irish bank deposits and into bonds the</text>
  <text start="857.559" dur="5.97">reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this because of</text>
  <text start="859.839" dur="6">the warnings of a new property crash in</text>
  <text start="863.529" dur="5.34">the housing market in ireland and</text>
  <text start="865.839" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re worried that they&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="868.869" dur="5.041">into the banks and do a belen so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="871.749" dur="4.44">removing their funds from that area and</text>
  <text start="873.91" dur="4.619">they moved about a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="876.189" dur="4.02">million euros out of the irish banking</text>
  <text start="878.529" dur="6.92">system into corporate and sovereign</text>
  <text start="880.209" dur="7.5">bonds so we can see already that</text>
  <text start="885.449" dur="5.17">corporations individuals they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="887.709" dur="6.92">preparing for what is coming they</text>
  <text start="890.619" dur="8.041">understand now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="894.629" dur="7.3">the FDIC is saying that the u.s. biggest</text>
  <text start="898.66" dur="8.07">banks they do not have enough capital</text>
  <text start="901.929" dur="8.551">reserves to whether a financial crisis</text>
  <text start="906.73" dur="8.69">they&amp;#39;re completely inadequate and if we</text>
  <text start="910.48" dur="8.159">had the same crisis that we had in 2008</text>
  <text start="915.42" dur="7.089">these banks would go completely under</text>
  <text start="918.639" dur="6.271">and right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="922.509" dur="7.5">these banks will go under they do not</text>
  <text start="924.91" dur="8.909">have enough and these banks will never</text>
  <text start="930.009" dur="5.731">have enough and when we look at this and</text>
  <text start="933.819" dur="7.26">we look at the entire mess of the</text>
  <text start="935.74" dur="8.389">financial system these banks they had to</text>
  <text start="941.079" dur="5.76">follow a new regulation the Volcker rule</text>
  <text start="944.129" dur="8.68">that force banks to sell certain risky</text>
  <text start="946.839" dur="9.87">assets that might be toxic again and the</text>
  <text start="952.809" dur="7.2">rule was actually born in 2008 during</text>
  <text start="956.709" dur="6.241">after the financial crisis and it was</text>
  <text start="960.009" dur="5.641">supposed to go into effect by 2014</text>
  <text start="962.95" dur="4.95">but what happened was the bank said oh</text>
  <text start="965.65" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re not really ready can we delay</text>
  <text start="967.9" dur="6.06">this another year then another year went</text>
  <text start="970.15" dur="6.48">by another year went by and now they</text>
  <text start="973.96" dur="9.51">have a five-year extension through 2020</text>
  <text start="976.63" dur="10.38">to its eight years they had to sell off</text>
  <text start="983.47" dur="4.8">their high risk assets the reason why</text>
  <text start="987.01" dur="8.1">they haven&amp;#39;t been doing it is because</text>
  <text start="988.27" dur="10.56">they cannot find anyone to buy them so</text>
  <text start="995.11" dur="7.59">they&amp;#39;re holding them and this is a major</text>
  <text start="998.83" dur="6.74">problem so when the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="1002.7" dur="7.71">hits the banks will be insolvent and</text>
  <text start="1005.57" dur="8.56">they will proceed with ballons to bail</text>
  <text start="1010.41" dur="6.48">the banks out that means they will take</text>
  <text start="1014.13" dur="5.25">control of your funds inside of the bank</text>
  <text start="1016.89" dur="4.98">and they&amp;#39;ll give you worthless bank</text>
