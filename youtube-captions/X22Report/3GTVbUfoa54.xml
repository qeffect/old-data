  <text start="78.369" dur="4.981">gonna control it what is it going to be</text>
  <text start="80.35" dur="5.519">used for should we not use it it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="83.35" dur="5.31">central banking system their full</text>
  <text start="85.869" dur="4.021">control of everything even the founder</text>
  <text start="88.66" dur="3.48">of the world&amp;#39;s second biggest</text>
  <text start="89.89" dur="4.8">cryptocurrency aetherium has asked a</text>
  <text start="92.14" dur="6.47">question whether the central banking</text>
  <text start="94.69" dur="6.959">community whether their control is</text>
  <text start="98.61" dur="6.61">extended into the crypto cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="101.649" dur="5.791">realm and they&amp;#39;re asking about the I MMO</text>
  <text start="105.22" dur="4.319">blockchain project they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="107.44" dur="3.39">all different things and we need to</text>
  <text start="109.539" dur="3.271">understand something that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="110.83" dur="5.069">important right now and when we look at</text>
  <text start="112.81" dur="5.88">everything we can&amp;#39;t just say oh the</text>
  <text start="115.899" dur="5.61">central bankers control it oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.69" dur="3.959">created by the NSA so they can control</text>
  <text start="121.509" dur="2.761">everything and everything is just</text>
  <text start="122.649" dur="3.241">controlled think about the internet for</text>
  <text start="124.27" dur="4.92">a second now everyone&amp;#39;s gonna say well</text>
  <text start="125.89" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s controlled well certain ports parts</text>
  <text start="129.19" dur="4.89">of it is controlled yes they can control</text>
  <text start="131.77" dur="3.9">social media like YouTube they hacked</text>
  <text start="134.08" dur="4.56">can they can have an influence they can</text>
  <text start="135.67" dur="5.1">team up with the developers they can do</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="4.56">whatever they need to do try to control</text>
  <text start="140.77" dur="4.56">YouTube and gather data same thing with</text>
  <text start="143.2" dur="4.68">Facebook same thing with Google search</text>
  <text start="145.33" dur="5.94">engine but that&amp;#39;s not the Internet those</text>
  <text start="147.88" dur="4.89">are pieces that lay on the internet just</text>
  <text start="151.27" dur="3.93">like cryptocurrency just like the</text>
  <text start="152.77" dur="5.219">blockchain bitcoin is just one piece</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="5.16">aetherium is just one piece a theorem</text>
  <text start="157.989" dur="5.101">yes makes up a lot of the coins it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.36" dur="4.349">part of the coding but same same thing</text>
  <text start="163.09" dur="4.17">with HTML that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have</text>
  <text start="164.709" dur="4.291">full control over it now there are many</text>
  <text start="167.26" dur="4.71">people out there that have websites and</text>
  <text start="169" dur="5.4">they put their websites up they pay a</text>
  <text start="171.97" dur="4.47">host or they can set up a server in</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="3.78">their house and have a connection coming</text>
  <text start="176.44" dur="3.84">right into their house and guess what</text>
  <text start="178.18" dur="4.02">nobody can control it the same thing</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="4.26">with the blockchain the central bankers</text>
  <text start="182.2" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re not looking to control the</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="5.25">blockchain itself first of all be</text>
  <text start="187.21" dur="6.33">very very difficult to do secondly they</text>
  <text start="189.79" dur="6.3">want just to control a coin and they</text>
  <text start="193.54" dur="4.71">want everyone to use that coin that</text>
  <text start="196.09" dur="4.41">would be their endgame and just like the</text>
  <text start="198.25" dur="4.65">Internet with let&amp;#39;s say the alternative</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="4.2">media they never thought on the internet</text>
  <text start="202.9" dur="3.51">the alternative media was going to gain</text>
  <text start="204.7" dur="3.18">ground they never thought it&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="206.41" dur="4.41">possible they had the corporate media</text>
  <text start="207.88" dur="4.5">they control and they thought everyone</text>
  <text start="210.82" dur="3.45">would continually use the corporate</text>
  <text start="212.38" dur="4.08">media and that&amp;#39;s where you get your news</text>
  <text start="214.27" dur="4.5">and then the alternative media came</text>
  <text start="216.46" dur="3.99">along and all of a sudden they had a</text>
  <text start="218.77" dur="4.44">problem what they&amp;#39;re trying to do now</text>
  <text start="220.45" dur="4.14">with Bitcoin and other coins that are</text>
  <text start="223.21" dur="4.38">out there they&amp;#39;re trying to drive people</text>
  <text start="224.59" dur="4.89">away from it because they want really in</text>
  <text start="227.59" dur="4.14">the end to create their own coin and</text>
  <text start="229.48" dur="4.47">they want governments to acknowledge</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="3.78">their coin and say these are going to be</text>
  <text start="233.95" dur="3.42">the coins just like the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="235.51" dur="5.52">came out with the Federal Reserve Note</text>
  <text start="237.37" dur="5.85">and they forced everyone into that piece</text>
  <text start="241.03" dur="4.2">of paper all the other pieces of paper</text>
  <text start="243.22" dur="3.99">they can care less about somebody else</text>
  <text start="245.23" dur="3.24">can create it somebody else can create</text>
  <text start="247.21" dur="3.69">something where you can trade in gold</text>
  <text start="248.47" dur="5.07">physical and physical silver you can do</text>
  <text start="250.9" dur="4.65">that they don&amp;#39;t care but the government</text>
  <text start="253.54" dur="4.68">is saying this is the currency you need</text>
  <text start="255.55" dur="5.4">to use for all transactions here in the</text>
  <text start="258.22" dur="4.8">US and you have to pay your taxes using</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="4.02">the Federal Reserve Note the same thing</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="3.63">with the cryptocurrency market strip</text>
  <text start="264.97" dur="4.05">away the technology part and all that</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="5.01">other stuff they just want their coin</text>
  <text start="269.02" dur="4.95">and they want government&amp;#39;s to accept it</text>
  <text start="271.66" dur="3.69">then they want everyone in that coin</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="4.41">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been demonizing</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="4.95">everything else you just can&amp;#39;t say they</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="4.17">can control everything and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="5.19">really matter who created it because</text>
  <text start="282.55" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s laying on a system and there are</text>
  <text start="285.49" dur="4.32">many pieces to it just like the internet</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="4.86">and there&amp;#39;s many different functions to</text>
  <text start="289.81" dur="5.37">it and when you look at this you can see</text>
  <text start="292.48" dur="4.32">how this is laid out and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="295.18" dur="4.89">that it&amp;#39;s actually it&amp;#39;s quite impossible</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="5.61">to control something like this just like</text>
  <text start="300.07" dur="5.79">the internet you don&amp;#39;t know one</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="5.28">controlling my website I built it I put</text>
  <text start="305.86" dur="5.07">it up there I moved it three or four</text>
  <text start="307.69" dur="5.25">times and I have full control over it</text>
  <text start="310.93" dur="4.77">actually if I wanted more control I</text>
  <text start="312.94" dur="5.82">would get a line that&amp;#39;s coming into my</text>
  <text start="315.7" dur="4.86">home I would set up a server and host it</text>
  <text start="318.76" dur="2.249">myself if I want to complete full</text>
  <text start="320.56" dur="2.759">control</text>
  <text start="321.009" dur="4.5">over it well cryptocurrencies you have</text>
  <text start="323.319" dur="3.421">offline wallets you can control you</text>
  <text start="325.509" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t to be only exchanged you don&amp;#39;t to</text>
  <text start="326.74" dur="5.429">do any of that you can control all that</text>
  <text start="328.479" dur="6.42">so we see right now that it be very very</text>
  <text start="332.169" dur="4.53">difficult to control every aspect of it</text>
  <text start="334.899" dur="4.17">and that&amp;#39;s not really what they want to</text>
  <text start="336.699" dur="4.71">do that wouldn&amp;#39;t benefit them what they</text>
  <text start="339.069" dur="6.361">really want is they want their own</text>
  <text start="341.409" dur="6.57">little coin where everyone is pushed</text>
  <text start="345.43" dur="4.5">into where they can say this is the</text>
  <text start="347.979" dur="3.99">official coin everything else they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="349.93" dur="4.079">care about and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="351.969" dur="5.1">with paper currency and we can see right</text>
  <text start="354.009" dur="5.49">now this is the battle the people</text>
  <text start="357.069" dur="4.71">against the central bank if the people</text>
  <text start="359.499" dur="4.2">say listen we don&amp;#39;t want to go with the</text>
  <text start="361.779" dur="4.591">central bank currency while the people</text>
  <text start="363.699" dur="4.68">have to stand up and they have to say no</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="4.199">more central bank if there&amp;#39;s enough</text>
  <text start="368.379" dur="4.08">people around the world that do this the</text>
  <text start="370.569" dur="3.541">central bank goes down the tube and we</text>
  <text start="372.459" dur="3.721">will be making this transition one way</text>
  <text start="374.11" dur="4.649">or another we will be going into a</text>
  <text start="376.18" dur="5.43">different currency and we want it to be</text>
  <text start="378.759" dur="4.83">a controlled people&amp;#39;s currency without</text>
  <text start="381.61" dur="4.619">the central banking system we see</text>
  <text start="383.589" dur="5.13">case-shiller right now is reporting from</text>
  <text start="386.229" dur="5.61">their 20-city composite home price index</text>
  <text start="388.719" dur="6.63">that prices of homes they are rising</text>
  <text start="391.839" dur="5.521">very very quickly now this is very</text>
  <text start="395.349" dur="6.36">interesting because they have surpassed</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="5.279">the July 2006 record high we&amp;#39;re past</text>
  <text start="401.709" dur="3.57">that right now</text>
  <text start="402.639" dur="7.26">and we&amp;#39;re about three point eight times</text>
  <text start="405.279" dur="7.98">higher than the everyday worker pay</text>
  <text start="409.899" dur="5.61">which means the younger first-time</text>
  <text start="413.259" dur="4.83">homebuyers they&amp;#39;re gonna have a very</text>
  <text start="415.509" dur="4.71">difficult time purchasing a home because</text>
  <text start="418.089" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re seeing a huge amount of inflation</text>
  <text start="420.219" dur="4.081">in homes where they&amp;#39;re pumping up the</text>
  <text start="421.689" dur="5.19">bubbles and wages aren&amp;#39;t keeping up and</text>
  <text start="424.3" dur="5.909">this is going to be a major major</text>
  <text start="426.879" dur="4.89">problems and it&amp;#39;s going to hurt the real</text>
  <text start="430.209" dur="3.63">estate industry and as the interest</text>
  <text start="431.769" dur="3.33">rates rise the same things going to</text>
  <text start="433.839" dur="3.211">happen it&amp;#39;s going to kick a lot of these</text>
  <text start="435.099" dur="4.201">individuals that aren&amp;#39;t making a lot of</text>
  <text start="437.05" dur="3.839">money right out of the market because</text>
  <text start="439.3" dur="4.469">they can&amp;#39;t keep up with the prices of</text>
  <text start="440.889" dur="6.51">homes and if we look around the country</text>
  <text start="443.769" dur="5.971">we can see how out of whack this is I</text>
  <text start="447.399" dur="5.52">mean go to Los Angeles it&amp;#39;s a hundred</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="4.39">twenty two percent over the national</text>
  <text start="452.919" dur="3.401">level of income</text>
  <text start="454.13" dur="4.71">if we look at San Francisco it&amp;#39;s 107</text>
  <text start="456.32" dur="5.73">percent New York is 95 percent above</text>
  <text start="458.84" dur="4.86">this is completely unaffordable for the</text>
  <text start="462.05" dur="4.65">next generation and that&amp;#39;s what this is</text>
  <text start="463.7" dur="6.18">all about it&amp;#39;s the next generation and</text>
  <text start="466.7" dur="6.18">if we go back in time we can see that</text>
  <text start="469.88" dur="6.45">each generation it got harder and harder</text>
  <text start="472.88" dur="5.67">and harder as time went on and here we</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="4.44">are at the endgame and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="478.55" dur="4.53">difficult people for people if we go</text>
  <text start="480.77" dur="4.47">back to the beginning in 1970 or even</text>
  <text start="483.08" dur="4.59">prior to that well we didn&amp;#39;t really see</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="5.73">much inflation more on the gold standard</text>
  <text start="487.67" dur="6.03">we saw inflation right after we came off</text>
  <text start="490.97" dur="4.92">of the gold standard and they started to</text>
  <text start="493.7" dur="4.26">create a lot of currency that&amp;#39;s where we</text>
  <text start="495.89" dur="5.07">saw the inflation if you look at 1970s</text>
  <text start="497.96" dur="5.31">going to the 80s housing prices boom</text>
  <text start="500.96" dur="4.41">they just went up very very high if you</text>
  <text start="503.27" dur="4.32">look at wages boom they had to be</text>
  <text start="505.37" dur="5.49">readjusted because of what was happening</text>
  <text start="507.59" dur="5.22">now we&amp;#39;re at the opposite end wages are</text>
  <text start="510.86" dur="4.26">not moving up as quickly actually</text>
  <text start="512.81" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re declining in many areas but the</text>
  <text start="515.12" dur="4.29">housing prices they are continually</text>
  <text start="517.58" dur="3.839">being pushed up the stock market is</text>
  <text start="519.41" dur="5.31">continually being pushed up this is</text>
  <text start="521.419" dur="5.671">being done because people feel good when</text>
  <text start="524.72" dur="4.32">the housing prices are at their highest</text>
  <text start="527.09" dur="5.43">people feel good when the stock market</text>
  <text start="529.04" dur="5.49">is very high and it used to work where</text>
  <text start="532.52" dur="3.93">everything was great because wages were</text>
  <text start="534.53" dur="4.53">keeping up but we&amp;#39;re at the point now</text>
  <text start="536.45" dur="4.35">where they&amp;#39;ve disconnected and now the</text>
  <text start="539.06" dur="3.99">everyday person was coming out of</text>
  <text start="540.8" dur="6.21">college trying to get a job they cannot</text>
  <text start="543.05" dur="6.87">make that income and you see this at the</text>
  <text start="547.01" dur="4.71">end stage of an economy that is breaking</text>
  <text start="549.92" dur="3.93">down where they can&amp;#39;t raise interest</text>
  <text start="551.72" dur="4.44">rates where wages they&amp;#39;re pretty much</text>
  <text start="553.85" dur="5.34">flatlined where we see bubbles all over</text>
  <text start="556.16" dur="5.13">the place and bubbles are popping people</text>
  <text start="559.19" dur="3.78">can&amp;#39;t afford things because what happens</text>
  <text start="561.29" dur="3.78">is you can keep you keep creating these</text>
  <text start="562.97" dur="4.32">this currency over and over and over and</text>
  <text start="565.07" dur="4.77">before you know it it devalues the</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="4.65">currency and they call this inflation</text>
  <text start="569.84" dur="4.65">and it takes a lot more of those dollars</text>
  <text start="571.94" dur="4.2">to afford anything and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="574.49" dur="4.32">going to see this completely get out of</text>
  <text start="576.14" dur="4.5">control as time goes on now we just</text>
  <text start="578.81" dur="4.5">talked about this yesterday about the</text>
  <text start="580.64" dur="4.65">Italian banks and we talked about how</text>
  <text start="583.31" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re in really big trouble most of</text>
  <text start="585.29" dur="2.59">these banks are completely in some the</text>
  <text start="586.73" dur="3.57">central banks</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="4.5">been propping them up and they are</text>
  <text start="590.3" dur="3.58">imploding right now and it&amp;#39;s just funny</text>
  <text start="592.38" dur="3.86">that we just talked about this yesterday</text>
  <text start="593.88" dur="5.43">I mean Italy they woke up to a shear</text>
  <text start="596.24" dur="5.32">selling panic now we talked about this</text>
  <text start="599.31" dur="4.83">yesterday where everyone&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="601.56" dur="3.9">looking at the situation they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="604.14" dur="3.06">be margin calls they&amp;#39;re gonna be all</text>
  <text start="605.46" dur="4.53">these things happening and people are</text>
  <text start="607.2" dur="6.18">gonna start to sell and we saw a huge</text>
  <text start="609.99" dur="6.54">sell-off which mutated into a full-blown</text>
  <text start="613.38" dur="6.12">liquidation avalanche led by a furious</text>
  <text start="616.53" dur="6.72">repricing of the btp curve where two</text>

  <text start="678.57" dur="5.52">more currency and help these banks out</text>
  <text start="681.33" dur="4.92">maybe they will but what we can see from</text>

  <text start="691.2" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re gonna go into overdrive</text>
  <text start="693.39" dur="5.04">instead of unwinding cutting QE they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="696.66" dur="3.69">gonna switch gears and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="698.43" dur="3.75">create more QE because they start to</text>
  <text start="700.35" dur="4.8">realize what is happening here and</text>
  <text start="702.18" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to save these banks</text>
  <text start="705.15" dur="4.92">and save what is happening because they</text>
  <text start="707.64" dur="5.13">want to be in control of this whole</text>
  <text start="710.07" dur="4.53">thing coming down and I believe what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="712.77" dur="3.9">happening here is there&amp;#39;s holes in the</text>
  <text start="714.6" dur="2.85">dam and they&amp;#39;re putting fingers on the</text>
  <text start="716.67" dur="3.33">dam and they&amp;#39;re trying to hold</text>
  <text start="717.45" dur="3.5">everything together and it&amp;#39;s all falling</text>
  <text start="720" dur="3.08">apart remember</text>
  <text start="720.95" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that these banks</text>
  <text start="723.08" dur="4.14">are strong you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about</text>
  <text start="724.88" dur="4.77">the derivative market everything is</text>
  <text start="727.22" dur="4.92">great the economy is fine we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="729.65" dur="5.22">start to unwind we don&amp;#39;t need the QE</text>
  <text start="732.14" dur="5.37">anymore well everything&amp;#39;s falling apart</text>
  <text start="734.87" dur="4.32">very very quickly and they&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="737.51" dur="4.14">to try to stop it or just let it go if</text>
  <text start="739.19" dur="4.53">they let it go the world is gonna be</text>
  <text start="741.65" dur="4.65">looking at the central bank&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="743.72" dur="5.31">what just happened here you told us it</text>
  <text start="746.3" dur="6.27">was contained you told us everything was</text>
  <text start="749.03" dur="6.29">fine that the economy was strong and we</text>
  <text start="752.57" dur="5.64">can raise rates now and we can unwind</text>
  <text start="755.32" dur="4.6">but we can see this is not true we can</text>
  <text start="758.21" dur="3.51">see that it&amp;#39;s all breaking down very</text>
  <text start="759.92" dur="3.18">very quickly and again the central banks</text>
  <text start="761.72" dur="3.24">they don&amp;#39;t want them for this and this</text>
  <text start="763.1" dur="3.6">is going to spread they might put a</text>
  <text start="764.96" dur="4.41">band-aid over it they might put a little</text>
  <text start="766.7" dur="3.96">patch on the dam and stop that leak but</text>
  <text start="769.37" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s gonna be another one opening up</text>
  <text start="770.66" dur="3.66">and before you know it all these holes</text>
  <text start="772.7" dur="2.82">are gonna start spouting out water and</text>
  <text start="774.32" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to stop it and</text>
  <text start="775.52" dur="3.66">the dams gonna come down and we can see</text>
  <text start="777.8" dur="3.42">this is just the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="779.18" dur="4.89">economic meltdown it&amp;#39;s almost like if we</text>
  <text start="781.22" dur="4.38">go back to 2008 where they saved Bear</text>
  <text start="784.07" dur="3.27">Stearns and they said everything is</text>
  <text start="785.6" dur="4.83">contained don&amp;#39;t worry about it and then</text>
  <text start="787.34" dur="4.68">all of a sudden Lehman Brothers AIG the</text>
  <text start="790.43" dur="2.61">auto industry and everything just</text>
  <text start="792.02" dur="2.31">started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="793.04" dur="2.04">the same thing is going to happen and</text>
  <text start="794.33" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re gonna be going through a</text>
  <text start="795.08" dur="5.22">transition the transition is going to</text>
  <text start="797.87" dur="4.5">come the debt that is out there cannot</text>
  <text start="800.3" dur="3.48">be sustained their system and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="802.37" dur="3.45">talking about the central banking says</text>
  <text start="803.78" dur="4.38">only lasts for a certain period of time</text>
  <text start="805.82" dur="4.5">then it dies and they have to restart it</text>
  <text start="808.16" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re headed right now but</text>
  <text start="810.32" dur="3.72">what we need to do is we need to make</text>
  <text start="812.12" dur="4.32">sure that we restart it without the</text>
  <text start="814.04" dur="5.31">central bank we need to restart it with</text>
  <text start="816.44" dur="5.31">We the People and the central bank needs</text>
  <text start="819.35" dur="5.1">to be pushed out we don&amp;#39;t need them they</text>
  <text start="821.75" dur="6.42">don&amp;#39;t benefit we the people all they do</text>
  <text start="824.45" dur="6.6">is enslave the people into their system</text>
  <text start="828.17" dur="4.65">and there&amp;#39;s really no escape from their</text>
  <text start="831.05" dur="3.66">system and if you really think about it</text>
  <text start="832.82" dur="4.95">the only escape right now that people</text>
  <text start="834.71" dur="5.7">have had or is gold and silver which</text>
  <text start="837.77" dur="5.28">they suppress but you can still use it</text>
  <text start="840.41" dur="5.13">if you really wanted to to trade it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="843.05" dur="4.83">just a little difficult to use but then</text>
  <text start="845.54" dur="4.98">you also have cryptocurrency which is an</text>
  <text start="847.88" dur="5.43">electronic form which is outside of</text>
  <text start="850.52" dur="4.21">their system where you can use it to</text>
  <text start="853.31" dur="4.27">purchase and</text>
  <text start="854.73" dur="5.97">and whatnot and you can see right now</text>
  <text start="857.58" dur="6.57">this is what they&amp;#39;re mostly afraid of</text>
  <text start="860.7" dur="5.49">that we will transition away from their</text>
  <text start="864.15" dur="5.25">system and this is what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="866.19" dur="5.4">to stop they want to keep us in their</text>
  <text start="869.4" dur="5.37">new system whatever it&amp;#39;s going to be and</text>
  <text start="871.59" dur="5.97">I&amp;#39;m sure they have plans on convincing</text>
  <text start="874.77" dur="4.98">governments to go with their new system</text>
  <text start="877.56" dur="4.65">but the people around the world they</text>
  <text start="879.75" dur="4.89">need to start waking up people need to</text>
  <text start="882.21" dur="4.32">start to realize that we don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="884.64" dur="5.16">centrioles we don&amp;#39;t want their system we</text>
  <text start="886.53" dur="5.85">will control our own system we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="889.8" dur="4.65">need a private corporation we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="892.38" dur="4.59">the Ross trial we don&amp;#39;t need any of them</text>
  <text start="894.45" dur="6.27">they don&amp;#39;t benefit us so get prepared</text>
