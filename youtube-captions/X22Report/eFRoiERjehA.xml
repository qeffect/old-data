  <text start="110.679" dur="6.33">looks like the signups are starting for</text>
  <text start="113.38" dur="6.21">Obamacare once again and we can see that</text>
  <text start="117.009" dur="5.67">the premiums and deductibles they have</text>
  <text start="119.59" dur="4.74">been surging and 2018 it looks like</text>
  <text start="122.679" dur="3.631">these things are going to go through the</text>
  <text start="124.33" dur="4.439">roof and people are going to look at</text>
  <text start="126.31" dur="4.5">this and say wow this is a lot of money</text>
  <text start="128.769" dur="4.141">and this is going to be a crucial six</text>
  <text start="130.81" dur="4.89">week stretch that could test how</text>
  <text start="132.91" dur="4.23">Obamacare really does because we can see</text>
  <text start="135.7" dur="5.67">that a lot of the exchanges they&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="137.14" dur="6.959">belly-up they they went bankrupt a lot</text>
  <text start="141.37" dur="4.44">of money was spent on this and people</text>
  <text start="144.099" dur="3.691">right now are looking at this saying</text>
  <text start="145.81" dur="4.56">listen this is really really expensive</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="4.49">let me give you an example this is a</text>
  <text start="150.37" dur="4.92">real life example of Richard Taylor is</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="5.86">one of the people that didn&amp;#39;t end up</text>
  <text start="155.29" dur="5.82">where he made out with Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="158.14" dur="6.66">there&amp;#39;s many individuals like this now</text>
  <text start="161.11" dur="7.62">he&amp;#39;s 61 years old self-employed lives in</text>
  <text start="164.8" dur="7.62">Oklahoma and he has a meticulous tract</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="7.229">his medical cost since 1994 so he knows</text>
  <text start="172.42" dur="5.489">how much things are now in 2013 he</text>
  <text start="175.959" dur="4.34">signed up for the Affordable Care Act</text>
  <text start="177.909" dur="4.621">for the laws first year offering</text>
  <text start="180.299" dur="5.77">coverage of millions of Americans now</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="6.569">four years ago his annual premium from</text>
  <text start="186.069" dur="5.491">level silver plan was around 10,000 72</text>
  <text start="189.099" dur="4.351">dollars a year which is quite expensive</text>
  <text start="191.56" dur="5.039">he said it&amp;#39;s a lot more money than</text>
  <text start="193.45" dur="5.34">before Obamacare before it was a lot</text>
  <text start="196.599" dur="5.431">less but then he tracked it and said</text>
  <text start="198.79" dur="4.86">okay here we are in 2017 my premiums</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="3.72">have gone up a hundred and twelve</text>
  <text start="203.65" dur="4.47">percent I am now paying twenty one</text>
  <text start="205.75" dur="6.049">thousand three hundred and ninety two</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="7.979">dollars now to think about that for</text>
  <text start="211.799" dur="7.39">years and it is doubled and he is paying</text>
  <text start="216.099" dur="6.12">twenty one thousand dollars for medical</text>
  <text start="219.189" dur="4.44">coverage and this has been happening to</text>
  <text start="222.219" dur="3.63">many many people this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="223.629" dur="4.08">been opting out and taking the tax</text>
  <text start="225.849" dur="5.07">penalty because it&amp;#39;s a lot lot cheaper</text>
  <text start="227.709" dur="6.48">to do so it&amp;#39;s not even close to the</text>
  <text start="230.919" dur="5.1">twenty one thousand so we can see right</text>
  <text start="234.189" dur="3.961">now that this whole thing is not working</text>
  <text start="236.019" dur="4.89">and if we break it down to different</text>
  <text start="238.15" dur="6.149">states I mean we look at Iowa we look at</text>
  <text start="240.909" dur="5.431">Wyoming we look at Georgia Florida I</text>
  <text start="244.299" dur="4.14">mean we&amp;#39;re looking at anywhere from</text>
  <text start="246.34" dur="6.229">thirty five percent all the way up to</text>
  <text start="248.439" dur="6.871">seventy percent increase in premiums and</text>
  <text start="252.569" dur="7.03">many of there&amp;#39;s only three states where</text>
  <text start="255.31" dur="7.38">it is dropped and it&amp;#39;s Arizona North</text>
  <text start="259.599" dur="5.121">Dakota and Arkansas that&amp;#39;s it the rest</text>
  <text start="262.69" dur="5.19">of the states they have all increased</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="5.08">anywhere from eight percent all the way</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="3.39">up to seventy percent so it depends on</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="3.75">the state where you are so the majority</text>
  <text start="271.27" dur="4.95">of the states they&amp;#39;re seeing this huge</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="5.04">huge increase the median is around</text>
  <text start="276.22" dur="5.37">thirty five percent so this is</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="5.579">unsustainable the people well it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="281.59" dur="5.37">for the people and this is why our</text>
  <text start="284.169" dur="5.55">government employees you know the people</text>
  <text start="286.96" dur="5.28">in Congress the president back in the</text>
  <text start="289.719" dur="4.17">you know when Obama issued this whole</text>
  <text start="292.24" dur="3.959">thing and created it he&amp;#39;d even take it</text>
  <text start="293.889" dur="4.52">they all exempted themselves actually</text>
  <text start="296.199" dur="5.34">Obama came in and exempted the staff</text>
  <text start="298.409" dur="6.04">that&amp;#39;s how bad it is when your</text>
  <text start="301.539" dur="5.581">government exempts themselves and said</text>
  <text start="304.449" dur="6.03">and they tell you that this is great you</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="5.519">know there&amp;#39;s a problem now a couple days</text>
  <text start="310.479" dur="7.261">ago we talked about Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="312.639" dur="6.93">her law from PEC ins and they paid to</text>
  <text start="317.74" dur="4.59">have this dossier</text>
  <text start="319.569" dur="4.62">created now the amount wasn&amp;#39;t really out</text>
  <text start="322.33" dur="4.41">there and now that we learn that the</text>
  <text start="324.189" dur="5.19">total was just over 1 million dollars</text>
  <text start="326.74" dur="4.259">which they paid to fusion GPS we know</text>
  <text start="329.379" dur="4.47">that Obama has paid around nine hundred</text>
  <text start="330.999" dur="7.44">and seventy thousand and we see right</text>
  <text start="333.849" dur="7.05">now that this money went to create this</text>
  <text start="338.439" dur="4.081">dossier the opposition research of which</text>
  <text start="340.899" dur="3.42">one hundred sixty eight thousand was</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="4.289">sent to the British spy Christopher</text>
  <text start="344.319" dur="5.37">Steele so we can see that more and more</text>
  <text start="346.809" dur="7.53">information is coming out and we can see</text>
  <text start="349.689" dur="7.141">that yes Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s team paid for</text>
  <text start="354.339" dur="5.85">this and what was very interesting about</text>
  <text start="356.83" dur="8.369">this is that they try to hide it they</text>
  <text start="360.189" dur="7.891">try to hide the payment to fusion gps by</text>
  <text start="365.199" dur="6.21">routing it routing them through her law</text>
  <text start="368.08" dur="5.609">firm and this prompted the campaign</text>
  <text start="371.409" dur="3.9">Legal Center CLC to file a complaint</text>
  <text start="373.689" dur="3.66">with the Federal Election Committee</text>

  <text start="388.719" dur="4.641">payments for the dossier of research</text>

  <text start="478.319" dur="4.68">and more of it will continue to come out</text>
  <text start="481.68" dur="3.53">because we can see that these people are</text>

  <text start="521.94" dur="5.22">being stopped and these people might go</text>
  <text start="524.61" dur="4.89">to prison right now which is ridiculous</text>

  <text start="582.329" dur="5.011">they&amp;#39;re you know up to no good we see</text>
  <text start="586.23" dur="2.48">right now and we</text>
  <text start="587.34" dur="5.94">talking about this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="588.71" dur="7.66">that the u.s. is quietly pursuing direct</text>

  <text start="611.16" dur="5.1">involved in this even South Korea and</text>
  <text start="613.92" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re doing this because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="616.26" dur="5.16">trying to come the entire situation down</text>
  <text start="618.84" dur="5.67">and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised surprised if</text>
  <text start="621.42" dur="6.18">there is a deal that is made and this is</text>
  <text start="624.51" dur="6.3">a shock to the corporate media to the</text>

  <text start="630.81" dur="4.86">the UN Security Council to condemn</text>

  <text start="661.19" dur="5.86">completely eradicate the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="664.11" dur="7.14">from Syria now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="667.05" dur="7.29">second in eight weeks we&amp;#39;re talking the</text>
  <text start="671.25" dur="4.59">end of this year they&amp;#39;re going to remove</text>
  <text start="674.34" dur="5.34">the paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="675.84" dur="7.47">from Syria Russia and Syria Assad will</text>
  <text start="679.68" dur="6.3">have control of the full country at this</text>
  <text start="683.31" dur="4.44">point they&amp;#39;re going to ask the United</text>
  <text start="685.98" dur="4.07">States the coalition forces maybe even</text>
  <text start="687.75" dur="4.8">before this point to leave the country</text>
  <text start="690.05" dur="4.63">now we know that Tillerson was out there</text>
  <text start="692.55" dur="4.35">saying even if Iraq tells us to leave</text>
  <text start="694.68" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re not leaving so if Syria tells them</text>
  <text start="696.9" dur="4.62">to leave are they leaving because if a</text>
  <text start="699.15" dur="4.83">country tells another country listen we</text>
  <text start="701.52" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t want your Armed Forces here that</text>
  <text start="703.98" dur="6.75">is considered an invasion at that point</text>
  <text start="706.32" dur="6.33">and remember Syria never invited the</text>
  <text start="710.73" dur="4.8">United States or the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="712.65" dur="7.31">into the country so everything is going</text>
  <text start="715.53" dur="6.73">to change in the next eight weeks</text>
  <text start="719.96" dur="5.16">if everything goes as planned as Russia</text>
  <text start="722.26" dur="5.71">expects we&amp;#39;re going to see something</text>
  <text start="725.12" dur="4.62">happen now they have this eight weeks</text>
  <text start="727.97" dur="4.47">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the Cabal to maybe</text>
  <text start="729.74" dur="3.84">pull off an event will they will have to</text>
  <text start="732.44" dur="3.75">wait and see because we could see right</text>
  <text start="733.58" dur="5.37">now that they&amp;#39;re running out of time and</text>
  <text start="736.19" dur="5.399">it&amp;#39;s accelerating there it&amp;#39;s the clock</text>
  <text start="738.95" dur="4.5">is ticking down now and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="741.589" dur="6.12">in really big trouble because if they</text>
  <text start="743.45" dur="6.59">leave Syria Syria they have no chance of</text>
  <text start="747.709" dur="6.541">getting back in that is a done deal and</text>
  <text start="750.04" dur="6.58">Syria Russia Iran they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="754.25" dur="3.54">working with each other the rest of the</text>
  <text start="756.62" dur="3.3">Middle Eastern countries are going to</text>
  <text start="757.79" dur="3.12">see this and they&amp;#39;re going to be moving</text>
  <text start="759.92" dur="2.49">away from the United States and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="760.91" dur="4.17">gonna ask the United States to get out</text>
  <text start="762.41" dur="5.429">of their countries so everything is</text>
  <text start="765.08" dur="5.009">about to change and it&amp;#39;s happening very</text>
  <text start="767.839" dur="3.991">very quickly we see Russia wants new</text>
  <text start="770.089" dur="3.781">rules for Syria chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="771.83" dur="3.66">inspectors they don&amp;#39;t want to use the</text>
  <text start="773.87" dur="3.659">old rules that the United States was</text>
  <text start="775.49" dur="4.409">using in the coalition forces using they</text>
  <text start="777.529" dur="4.531">want something completely different so</text>
  <text start="779.899" dur="4.201">they can have an honest investigation on</text>
  <text start="782.06" dur="3.48">what was really going on here and of</text>
  <text start="784.1" dur="3">course United States the Kabala they</text>
  <text start="785.54" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t want an honest investigation</text>
  <text start="787.1" dur="2.97">because if there was an honest</text>
  <text start="788.69" dur="3.93">investigation where investigators</text>
  <text start="790.07" dur="4.11">actually went in to the site and they</text>
  <text start="792.62" dur="4.62">investigated what was going on there</text>
  <text start="794.18" dur="4.44">well we know what would happen the</text>
  <text start="797.24" dur="3.45">fingers will be pointing at the paid</text>
  <text start="798.62" dur="5.37">mercenaries at the Syrian democratic</text>
  <text start="800.69" dur="4.74">forces at the moderate rebels and they</text>
  <text start="803.99" dur="3.06">would be saying they&amp;#39;re the ones who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="805.43" dur="3.45">been using chemical weapons they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="807.05" dur="3.18">ones who brought him in or created them</text>
  <text start="808.88" dur="2.34">they&amp;#39;re the ones who used it</text>
  <text start="810.23" dur="3.299">they&amp;#39;re the ones who used it on the</text>
  <text start="811.22" dur="5.22">people and guess what if that does</text>
  <text start="813.529" dur="4.771">happen well their whole movement goes</text>
  <text start="816.44" dur="5.55">down the tube so they have two things</text>
  <text start="818.3" dur="5.07">working against them right now and we</text>
  <text start="821.99" dur="4.23">can see the clock is definitely ticking</text>
  <text start="823.37" dur="4.709">down now Kaspersky is out there and</text>
  <text start="826.22" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re saying that they have detected a</text>
  <text start="828.079" dur="5.491">virus that steals Bitcoin and other</text>
  <text start="830.48" dur="5.28">cryptocurrencies and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="833.57" dur="5.22">is that this new virus called crypto</text>
  <text start="835.76" dur="4.769">shuffler activates itself when a</text>
  <text start="838.79" dur="5.28">targeted user attempts to transfer money</text>
  <text start="840.529" dur="6.451">from one wallet to another now what</text>
  <text start="844.07" dur="5.37">happens is that this new virus is</text>
  <text start="846.98" dur="5.54">triggered and you know when you copy and</text>
  <text start="849.44" dur="5.21">paste your public your public address to</text>
  <text start="852.52" dur="5.73">send your cryptocurrency someplace else</text>
  <text start="854.65" dur="6.87">it takes a snapshot of this wild in</text>
  <text start="858.25" dur="6.03">memory and changes it to their public</text>
  <text start="861.52" dur="5.97">address and when you hit paste your</text>
  <text start="864.28" dur="6.48">money is going someplace else now if you</text>
  <text start="867.49" dur="5.31">are transferring money from one wallet</text>
  <text start="870.76" dur="4.26">to another or from an exchange to your</text>
  <text start="872.8" dur="5.61">wallet or from your wallet to an</text>
  <text start="875.02" dur="6.39">exchange make sure that you see what the</text>
  <text start="878.41" dur="6.3">public address is when you paste it make</text>
  <text start="881.41" dur="5.76">sure it matches if it switches well stop</text>
  <text start="884.71" dur="5.22">the transaction and don&amp;#39;t go any further</text>
  <text start="887.17" dur="5.85">because that means you have that virus</text>
  <text start="889.93" dur="5.04">on your system and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="893.02" dur="3.74">problem because it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="894.97" dur="4.17">impossible to get that money back and</text>
  <text start="896.76" dur="4.21">it&amp;#39;s almost like if you had a bank</text>
  <text start="899.14" dur="4.14">account and you are doing banking online</text>
  <text start="900.97" dur="4.68">and the computer took a snapshot of your</text>
  <text start="903.28" dur="4.53">bank account and you were giving someone</text>
  <text start="905.65" dur="4.74">your account number to send a wire or</text>
  <text start="907.81" dur="5.46">something and it switched it to someone</text>
  <text start="910.39" dur="4.74">else&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the same exact thing so this</text>
  <text start="913.27" dur="3.9">just doesn&amp;#39;t affect cryptocurrency this</text>
  <text start="915.13" dur="3.99">could be used for anything so I would be</text>
  <text start="917.17" dur="5.37">very very careful when you&amp;#39;re sending</text>
  <text start="919.12" dur="5.94">money on your system I would make sure</text>
  <text start="922.54" dur="5.13">you look at the account number your</text>
  <text start="925.06" dur="4.77">address and make sure it&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="927.67" dur="4.11">it is when you were looking at it when</text>
  <text start="929.83" dur="4.38">you before you copied it and make sure</text>
  <text start="931.78" dur="6.57">they match up completely and if they do</text>
  <text start="934.21" dur="8.22">then it&amp;#39;s okay to send the funds and we</text>
  <text start="938.35" dur="7.23">can see right now that the establishment</text>
  <text start="942.43" dur="7.02">the Cabal they&amp;#39;re out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="945.58" dur="4.86">trying to slow everyone using</text>
  <text start="949.45" dur="4.35">cryptocurrency because think about</text>
  <text start="950.44" dur="6.21">what&amp;#39;s happening here first we have the</text>
  <text start="953.8" dur="4.8">Ransom of wanna cry and many other type</text>
  <text start="956.65" dur="5.22">of malware&amp;#39;s where they&amp;#39;re saying and</text>
  <text start="958.6" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re demanding pick coin as ransom or</text>
  <text start="961.87" dur="3.6">they lock up your computer it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="963.22" dur="5.22">encrypted so they try to make the</text>
  <text start="965.47" dur="5.25">cryptocurrency they try to make it look</text>
  <text start="968.44" dur="4.53">evil like oh this is what other people</text>
  <text start="970.72" dur="4.41">use and this is why we can&amp;#39;t you know</text>
  <text start="972.97" dur="4.23">this is why you shouldn&amp;#39;t use it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="975.13" dur="3.42">out there reporting that there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="977.2" dur="3.45">virus and we know that most of these</text>
  <text start="978.55" dur="5.6">viruses they&amp;#39;re created by the CIA the</text>
  <text start="980.65" dur="5.3">Intelligence offices mi5 or many other</text>
  <text start="984.15" dur="4.53">intelligent organization</text>
  <text start="985.95" dur="5.4">and they done this on purpose again to</text>
  <text start="988.68" dur="4.589">scare the people to redirect the people</text>
  <text start="991.35" dur="3.359">into doing something else and it looks</text>
  <text start="993.269" dur="3.211">like this is what they&amp;#39;re doing it right</text>
  <text start="994.709" dur="4.38">now because remember everything that</text>
  <text start="996.48" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re doing is trying to save their</text>
  <text start="999.089" dur="6.091">system everything that you see out there</text>
  <text start="1001.76" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s them pushing their agenda and you</text>
  <text start="1005.18" dur="3.69">could see that they&amp;#39;re running out of</text>
  <text start="1006.23" dur="4.77">gas they have nothing left to push and</text>
  <text start="1008.87" dur="3.959">people are just shrugging it off now</text>
  <text start="1011" dur="4.44">saying it&amp;#39;s not that big of a deal</text>
  <text start="1012.829" dur="4.351">and this is why as people keep shrugging</text>
  <text start="1015.44" dur="3.81">it off and saying okay it&amp;#39;s not that big</text>
  <text start="1017.18" dur="4.26">of a deal they&amp;#39;re going to push the</text>
  <text start="1019.25" dur="4.89">bigger event because we can see right</text>
  <text start="1021.44" dur="4.68">now they&amp;#39;re going to have no choice and</text>
  <text start="1024.14" dur="3.929">there&amp;#39;s going to be a time it&amp;#39;s either</text>
  <text start="1026.12" dur="4.23">they do it or don&amp;#39;t do it and if that</text>
