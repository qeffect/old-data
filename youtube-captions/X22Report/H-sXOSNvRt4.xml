  <text start="119.25" dur="3.689">noticing something that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="120.869" dur="5.341">interesting is that all of them are</text>
  <text start="122.939" dur="5.49">starting to deteriorate decline very</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="4.559">rapidly and we talked about the</text>
  <text start="128.429" dur="5.491">restaurants Performance Index before and</text>
  <text start="130.769" dur="6.511">we see coming out of black box their</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="5.34">report it shows that things are not</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="2.489">going very well in the restaurant</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="4.289">industry</text>
  <text start="139.769" dur="6.421">now based on weekly sales data from over</text>
  <text start="143.549" dur="4.521">27,000 restaurants and about a hundred</text>
  <text start="146.19" dur="5.22">and fifty five brands representing about</text>
  <text start="148.07" dur="5.56">67 billion dollars in annual revenue</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="5.72">what did we find</text>
  <text start="153.63" dur="6.99">well we found that in May it was</text>
  <text start="157.13" dur="7.03">disappointing and Shayn restaurants are</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="5.94">not doing well same store sales were</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="4.41">down by negative 1.1 percent which</text>
  <text start="166.56" dur="5.25">represents a 0.1 percent decline from</text>
  <text start="168.57" dur="7.229">April at the same time same store</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="6.239">traffic growth also dropped by 3% that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="175.799" dur="5.19">down 3.2 percent on a rolling</text>
  <text start="178.049" dur="6.151">three-month basis now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="180.989" dur="4.921">here is things are rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="184.2" dur="2.28">people do not have the funds they used</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="2.13">to</text>
  <text start="186.48" dur="3.24">and as more and more people lose their</text>
  <text start="188.04" dur="5.009">jobs because people losing their jobs in</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="6.48">retail with major corporations we see</text>
  <text start="193.049" dur="5.55">that it is taking its toll now more</text>
  <text start="196.2" dur="5.429">concerning about all of this is that the</text>
  <text start="198.599" dur="5.791">restaurant industry has not reported a</text>
  <text start="201.629" dur="4.981">month of positive sales since February</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="4.709">of 2016 and this is according to black</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="4.739">box now when we look at the National</text>
  <text start="209.099" dur="4.73">Restaurant Association their report</text>
  <text start="211.349" dur="5.851">shows pretty much the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="213.829" dur="6.641">result of softer sales customer traffic</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="5.52">levels are down and optimism among</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="5.76">restaurant operators well that is</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="6.239">declining and we can see right now if we</text>
  <text start="226.23" dur="5.28">look at some of the data 22% of the</text>
  <text start="228.959" dur="5.911">restaurant operator said they expect</text>
  <text start="231.51" dur="5.67">economic conditions to improve in six</text>
  <text start="234.87" dur="4.38">months that sounds well that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="6.3">sound that bad but that&amp;#39;s 15 percent</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="7.79">down where was six months ago so really</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="7.439">it was 37% thought it was going to be</text>
  <text start="247.04" dur="5.559">better times ahead of us now only 22</text>
  <text start="250.919" dur="4.171">percent believe there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="252.599" dur="6.51">better times ahead of us which leaves</text>
  <text start="255.09" dur="6.66">the rest saying things are awful right</text>
  <text start="259.109" dur="5.81">now and we see no improvement whatsoever</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="6.419">and we can see from the retail industry</text>
  <text start="264.919" dur="4.631">that&amp;#39;s collapsing for a reason now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.169" dur="2.821">moving into the restaurant industry</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="4.35">which we&amp;#39;ve been seeing for quite a</text>
  <text start="270.99" dur="6.21">while but it&amp;#39;s actually deepening now</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="5.579">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see financial</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="5.939">institutions fall apart</text>
  <text start="279.479" dur="6.69">we know that Banco Popular well that was</text>
  <text start="283.139" dur="6.09">bailed in we see another Bank in Spain</text>
  <text start="286.169" dur="6.841">well they might be right behind Banco</text>
  <text start="289.229" dur="7.351">Popular this is Lee Burbank now this is</text>
  <text start="293.01" dur="5.31">a mini Bankia that was spun in 2011 from</text>
  <text start="296.58" dur="5.22">the forced marriage of three failed</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="5.7">saving banks in Spain and we see already</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="5.82">right now that shares already have</text>
  <text start="304.02" dur="7.32">plunged 17% at one point they were down</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="5.82">38% and we might be seeing another</text>
  <text start="311.34" dur="4.44">bailing like this is like a domino</text>
  <text start="313.44" dur="5.909">effect where it&amp;#39;s going from bank to</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="4.469">bank to bank now Goldman Sachs is saying</text>
  <text start="319.349" dur="3.09">that the</text>
  <text start="320.249" dur="5.85">last time the market acted like this was</text>
  <text start="322.439" dur="5.97">at the tech bubble peak and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.099" dur="5.37">starting to see a lot of economic</text>
  <text start="328.409" dur="6">indicators especially very important</text>
  <text start="331.469" dur="6.09">ones which always bring us into a</text>
  <text start="334.409" dur="5.87">recession when this happens and one</text>
  <text start="337.559" dur="6.3">indicator well is it has remained a</text>
  <text start="340.279" dur="7.75">fail-safe marker of economic contraction</text>
  <text start="343.859" dur="6.09">since the 60s and every time commercial</text>
  <text start="348.029" dur="4.98">and industrial loan balances have</text>
  <text start="349.949" dur="6.33">declined or simply stopped growing and</text>
  <text start="353.009" dur="6.18">that could be for any reason for a loan</text>
  <text start="356.279" dur="4.7">Titan loan supply or declining the ban</text>
  <text start="359.189" dur="4.86">doesn&amp;#39;t really make a difference a</text>
  <text start="360.979" dur="5.77">recession has already been in progress</text>
  <text start="364.049" dur="4.38">or it was going to start soon now from</text>
  <text start="366.749" dur="4.29">all the economic indicators that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="368.429" dur="4.32">been looking at we realized at this</text>
  <text start="371.039" dur="3.09">point we&amp;#39;re already in recession now the</text>
  <text start="372.749" dur="3.12">government is not going to come out and</text>
  <text start="374.129" dur="3.33">say hey we&amp;#39;re in a recession they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="375.869" dur="2.91">do this until months and months later</text>
  <text start="377.459" dur="3.96">and they go back in time they say oh</text>
  <text start="378.779" dur="5.16">yeah by the way the recession it started</text>
  <text start="381.419" dur="4.92">in July of 2016 just to let everyone</text>
  <text start="383.939" dur="4.921">know even though at that time they were</text>
  <text start="386.339" dur="4.8">saying there was no recession so what</text>
  <text start="388.86" dur="6.229">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is these</text>
  <text start="391.139" dur="6.63">indicators that are pretty exact on</text>
  <text start="395.089" dur="5.74">letting us know when there is a</text>
  <text start="397.769" dur="6.6">recession or a great economic crisis</text>
  <text start="400.829" dur="6.12">headed our way and if we look at the</text>
  <text start="404.369" dur="5.55">commercial and industrial loans every</text>
  <text start="406.949" dur="5.61">time we reach a certain peak of where</text>
  <text start="409.919" dur="5.4">all of a sudden loans start to decline</text>
  <text start="412.559" dur="4.95">where the creation is not there and it</text>
  <text start="415.319" dur="5.73">starts heading the other way we end up</text>
  <text start="417.509" dur="8.37">in a recession now we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="421.049" dur="9.561">the 90s we saw this back in 2000 2001 we</text>
  <text start="425.879" dur="8.7">saw it back in 2008 and here we are in</text>
  <text start="430.61" dur="7.989">2017 and we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact</text>
  <text start="434.579" dur="7.31">thing now u.s. loans have failed to post</text>
  <text start="438.599" dur="6.15">any material increase in over 30</text>
  <text start="441.889" dur="5.65">consecutive weeks suddenly the US finds</text>
  <text start="444.749" dur="5.97">itself on the verge of an inflection</text>
  <text start="447.539" dur="6.731">point now after growing around 7% year</text>
  <text start="450.719" dur="7.571">on year we have declined by 3</text>
  <text start="454.27" dur="7.56">and at the end of March and 2.6% at the</text>
  <text start="458.29" dur="5.58">end of April the latest bank loan update</text>
  <text start="461.83" dur="5.85">from the Fed showed that the annual rate</text>
  <text start="463.87" dur="6.77">of increase in the loans is now down 1.6</text>
  <text start="467.68" dur="5.88">percent this is the lowest since 2011</text>
  <text start="470.64" dur="5.95">now let&amp;#39;s take the commercial and</text>
  <text start="473.56" dur="6.45">industrial loans that is declining now</text>
  <text start="476.59" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;ve stopped growing let&amp;#39;s look at the</text>
  <text start="480.01" dur="4.32">commercial bank loans right now now</text>
  <text start="482.65" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;ve discussed this in the past and</text>
  <text start="484.33" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;ve been noticing that it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="485.92" dur="4.77">declining declining declining and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.5" dur="5.07">not seeing any type of growth anymore</text>
  <text start="490.69" dur="6.24">from this area and if this persists of</text>
  <text start="493.57" dur="5.04">this deceleration persists well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.93" dur="2.88">going to end up in a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="498.61" dur="4.38">because we see commercial and industrial</text>
  <text start="499.81" dur="4.98">we see commercial bank loans and the</text>
  <text start="502.99" dur="4.65">u.s. right now will post its first</text>
  <text start="504.79" dur="5.22">negative loan growth or rather loan</text>
  <text start="507.64" dur="5.52">contraction since the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="510.01" dur="6">in roughly four to six weeks let&amp;#39;s look</text>
  <text start="513.16" dur="7.71">at the real estate loan now after</text>
  <text start="516.01" dur="7.95">peaking in late 2016 real estate loan</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="5.31">growth has decelerated by nearly half to</text>
  <text start="523.96" dur="4.8">4.6 percent let&amp;#39;s take a look at</text>
  <text start="526.18" dur="5.61">commercial auto loans now this started</text>
  <text start="528.76" dur="5.64">around September 2016 and there has been</text>
  <text start="531.79" dur="6.93">a sharp slowdown in commercial auto</text>
  <text start="534.4" dur="7.05">loans and the growth now is down to just</text>
  <text start="538.72" dur="6.36">a third or three percent of what it was</text>
  <text start="541.45" dur="6">a year ago now keep in mind the Fed this</text>
  <text start="545.08" dur="4.11">week is going to be looking at the</text>
  <text start="547.45" dur="3.75">economy and they&amp;#39;re going to make a</text>
  <text start="549.19" dur="4.92">decision if they should raise the</text>
  <text start="551.2" dur="5.16">interest rate now they realize that the</text>
  <text start="554.11" dur="4.17">first quarter it was a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="556.36" dur="2.64">even though it was revised they said it</text>
  <text start="558.28" dur="2.97">was an anomaly</text>
  <text start="559" dur="4.98">as a one-off thing the economy is going</text>
  <text start="561.25" dur="4.44">to improve going forward but everything</text>
  <text start="563.98" dur="4.41">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at is that the</text>
  <text start="565.69" dur="4.35">economy is declining I mean think about</text>
  <text start="568.39" dur="3.96">what we&amp;#39;ve been looking at retail stores</text>
  <text start="570.04" dur="5.52">I mean they&amp;#39;re projecting you know nine</text>
  <text start="572.35" dur="5.82">to nine thousand to what 10,000 stores</text>
  <text start="575.56" dur="5.13">closing bankruptcies are going to</text>
  <text start="578.17" dur="4.53">continue next year they&amp;#39;re factoring</text>
  <text start="580.69" dur="4.92">that there&amp;#39;s going to be about 13,000</text>
  <text start="582.7" dur="5.069">retail stores we&amp;#39;re seeing auto loans</text>
  <text start="585.61" dur="4.62">real estate loan</text>
  <text start="587.769" dur="5.07">housing existing home sales new</text>
  <text start="590.23" dur="4.589">construction it&amp;#39;s all declining right</text>
  <text start="592.839" dur="4.831">now right now everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="594.819" dur="6.481">looking at it is a complete disaster now</text>
  <text start="597.67" dur="5.729">we know the Fed raised rates even though</text>
  <text start="601.3" dur="2.819">the first quarter GDP was a complete</text>
  <text start="603.399" dur="3.141">disaster</text>
  <text start="604.119" dur="4.26">we know the unemployment numbers are</text>
  <text start="606.54" dur="4.149">manipulated the stock market is</text>
  <text start="608.379" dur="5.851">manipulated pretty much everything that</text>
  <text start="610.689" dur="5.541">we&amp;#39;re seeing is a manipulation now the</text>
  <text start="614.23" dur="4.5">Fed is going to look at the data and</text>
  <text start="616.23" dur="3.759">they&amp;#39;re going to say yes of course</text>
  <text start="618.73" dur="3.479">they&amp;#39;re going to say unemployment&amp;#39;s down</text>
  <text start="619.989" dur="4.681">at four point three percent the stock</text>
  <text start="622.209" dur="4.68">market&amp;#39;s going up and the economy looks</text>
  <text start="624.67" dur="4.409">pretty strong they might make the</text>
  <text start="626.889" dur="5.01">decision to raise the rates at this</text>
  <text start="629.079" dur="5.22">point saying that the economy is fine</text>
  <text start="631.899" dur="4.56">now we know in the background the</text>
  <text start="634.299" dur="3.421">economy is not fine things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="636.459" dur="2.85">falling apart I mean think about the</text>
  <text start="637.72" dur="2.729">things that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at it is</text>
  <text start="639.309" dur="4.62">a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="640.449" dur="6.151">now one they might have already</text>
  <text start="643.929" dur="4.44">triggered the economy coming down</text>
  <text start="646.6" dur="4.529">because since they raised the rates the</text>
  <text start="648.369" dur="5.58">last time things have accelerated and</text>
  <text start="651.129" dur="4.92">things had turned to the downside so</text>
  <text start="653.949" dur="4.05">they might not raise the rates because</text>
  <text start="656.049" dur="4.2">they already see that the economy is</text>
  <text start="657.999" dur="4.65">faltering this is really why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="660.249" dur="5.25">doing this they&amp;#39;re trying to trigger the</text>
  <text start="662.649" dur="4.74">economy where it starts to accelerate to</text>
  <text start="665.499" dur="5.46">the downside this is what they wanted to</text>
  <text start="667.389" dur="5.521">happen they did this prior to 2008 now</text>
  <text start="670.959" dur="4.651">if they raise the rates that means the</text>
  <text start="672.91" dur="5.549">last interest rates that they brought up</text>

  <text start="685.179" dur="5.421">been looking at all these different</text>
  <text start="686.199" dur="7.26">economic sectors and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="690.6" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re not strong at all things are</text>

  <text start="719.619" dur="1.84">point</text>
  <text start="720.249" dur="4.15">where</text>
