  <text start="247.81" dur="6.519">bailout cash already and the eurozone</text>
  <text start="251.9" dur="5.25">taxpayers and the IMF are left wondering</text>
  <text start="254.329" dur="5.821">what their bailout funds have been spent</text>
  <text start="257.15" dur="6.09">on in Greece and they are seem to be</text>
  <text start="260.15" dur="4.98">running out of these funds and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="272.87" dur="6.81">thirty percent or so maybe just right</text>
  <text start="275.63" dur="6.72">under that and they are running out of</text>
  <text start="279.68" dur="6.27">funds quickly and sooner or leather</text>
  <text start="282.35" dur="4.83">later they will need another bailout to</text>
  <text start="285.95" dur="3.87">keep them going because you have to</text>
  <text start="287.18" dur="4.11">remember when you have no revenue and</text>
  <text start="289.82" dur="5.16">you keep laying off people cuz Greece</text>
  <text start="291.29" dur="6.84">had to you know to get more of their</text>

  <text start="309.23" dur="4.92">around 25,000 i think it was 12,500</text>
  <text start="312.02" dur="5.61">first go around and then the second will</text>
  <text start="314.15" dur="5.01">go around another 12,500 again now these</text>

  <text start="319.16" dur="3.99">unemployment they have no work they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="321.23" dur="3.75">not contributing so now the government</text>
  <text start="323.15" dur="3.9">has more dead more payments more</text>
  <text start="324.98" dur="4.41">interest there are no tax revenues</text>
  <text start="327.05" dur="4.29">coming in so what happens the money runs</text>
  <text start="329.39" dur="5.7">out everyone wants to know what are you</text>
  <text start="331.34" dur="5.79">using all this money for and it the</text>
  <text start="335.09" dur="4.26">cycle just keeps going and going until</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="5.82">they can&amp;#39;t do it anymore and eventually</text>
  <text start="339.35" dur="5.61">it will end and the people will not be</text>
  <text start="342.95" dur="3.63">able the i mean the the grease</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="3.75">government will not be able to keep this</text>

  <text start="401.15" dur="4.89">starting the</text>
  <text start="402.59" dur="5.85">manipulation just like America has been</text>
  <text start="406.04" dur="4.32">using you know change the calculation</text>
  <text start="408.44" dur="4.59">make everything look better and we can</text>
  <text start="410.36" dur="3.93">show that we are improving and I</text>
  <text start="413.03" dur="2.46">wouldn&amp;#39;t you know if I was Spain I</text>
  <text start="414.29" dur="2.63">wouldn&amp;#39;t be going around while we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="415.49" dur="5.45">down to twenty six percent that just</text>
  <text start="416.92" dur="8.32">doesn&amp;#39;t make it you know it&amp;#39;s not a good</text>
  <text start="420.94" dur="7.27">unemployment rate but this is what this</text>

  <text start="439.22" dur="7.19">found temporary and precarious jobs of</text>
  <text start="443.93" dur="5.4">which sixty percent were temporary</text>
  <text start="446.41" dur="4.69">contract so here we go again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.33" dur="3.96">counting people who get you know one</text>
  <text start="451.1" dur="5.22">shot one temporary job to temporary jobs</text>
  <text start="453.29" dur="6.24">as full-time jobs but again these are</text>
  <text start="456.32" dur="5.28">underemployed if you were making let</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="3.18">throw it at a figure forty thousand</text>
  <text start="461.6" dur="3.6">dollars before and you&amp;#39;re going to get a</text>
  <text start="462.71" dur="6.53">job that&amp;#39;s temporary for eleven dollars</text>

  <text start="469.24" dur="8.23">support your family or yourself and it</text>
  <text start="473.06" dur="6.24">should really be counted as a job so</text>
  <text start="477.47" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re basically doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="479.3" dur="5.34">as what America does if you&amp;#39;re under</text>
  <text start="481.67" dur="7.53">employed or if you have a temp contract</text>
  <text start="484.64" dur="6.75">you&amp;#39;re fully employed and this goes on</text>

  <text start="537.38" dur="3.66">documentation or we don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="539" dur="4.8">correct documentation and this goes on</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="6.27">to say that during a blitz a single team</text>
  <text start="543.8" dur="8.04">with decline between 600 and 1500 mah</text>
  <text start="547.31" dur="6.75">nikesh modification files at a time he</text>
  <text start="551.84" dur="5.27">said in a sworn statement in order to</text>
  <text start="554.06" dur="6.6">justify such mass denials employees</text>
  <text start="557.11" dur="6.25">devised fictitious reasons for the</text>
  <text start="560.66" dur="5.31">rejections such as claiming that the</text>
  <text start="563.36" dur="6.78">homeowner had not filed the appropriate</text>
  <text start="565.97" dur="5.85">paperwork when they really had and it</text>
  <text start="570.14" dur="4.32">goes on to say we were told to lie to</text>
  <text start="571.82" dur="4.29">customers and claim at the bank that</text>
  <text start="574.46" dur="5.1">Bank of America had not received</text>
  <text start="576.11" dur="6.63">documents it had requested and this went</text>
  <text start="579.56" dur="5.34">on from 2007 to 20 2012 we were told</text>
  <text start="582.74" dur="4.47">that admitting that the bank received</text>
  <text start="584.9" dur="5.13">documents would open a can of worms and</text>
  <text start="587.21" dur="4.86">a bank of america was required to</text>
  <text start="590.03" dur="4.05">underwrite application within 30 days of</text>
  <text start="592.07" dur="4.08">receiving homeowners documents but the</text>
  <text start="594.08" dur="5.28">bank did not have adequate staff for the</text>
  <text start="596.15" dur="6">task and they made the deadline go past</text>
  <text start="599.36" dur="4.44">30 days and this way they just kept</text>
  <text start="602.15" dur="3.39">people waiting and waiting waiting and</text>
  <text start="603.8" dur="4.71">nothing ever happened and this is why</text>
