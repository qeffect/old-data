  <text start="226" dur="4.47">go into what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="227.92" dur="5.52">people&amp;#39;s economy now I separate this</text>
  <text start="230.47" dur="5.76">into the people&amp;#39;s economy and the stock</text>
  <text start="233.44" dur="4.98">market and there are two different</text>
  <text start="236.23" dur="3.75">things happening here we have the stock</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="4.53">market now the stock market has been</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="5.34">used many many many many times by the</text>
  <text start="242.95" dur="4.56">central bank by the deep state to show</text>
  <text start="245.32" dur="4.47">everyone how the economy is doing it</text>
  <text start="247.51" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s like an indicator saying listen if</text>
  <text start="249.79" dur="3.69">the stock market&amp;#39;s up the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="5.94">doing well if the stock markets down the</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="5.819">economy&amp;#39;s doing poorly Trump well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.44" dur="3.299">taking control over the stock market in</text>
  <text start="259.299" dur="4.081">the beginning people are very confused</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="5.401">of why we would he all of a sudden say</text>
  <text start="263.38" dur="5.94">listen I control the stock market and</text>
  <text start="266.14" dur="6.96">look how great it&amp;#39;s doing what he was</text>
  <text start="269.32" dur="5.88">doing he was using everything the deep</text>
  <text start="273.1" dur="5.04">state and the central banks have used in</text>
  <text start="275.2" dur="5.97">the past and using it today they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="278.14" dur="4.89">always used the stock market as an</text>
  <text start="281.17" dur="3.57">indicator on how the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="2.82">now we know this really has nothing to</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="2.85">do with the economy you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.85" dur="3.36">completely manipulated Trump is</text>
  <text start="287.59" dur="2.94">manipulating he has the magic wand he</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="3.81">can make and go up he can make go down</text>
  <text start="290.53" dur="6.66">and this is what he&amp;#39;s been doing since</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="5.34">he got into office and right now the</text>
  <text start="297.19" dur="3.449">people&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="298.36" dur="5.01">behind-the-scenes that is what is</text>
  <text start="300.639" dur="4.261">falling apart now you need to remember</text>
  <text start="303.37" dur="2.729">one thing that&amp;#39;s very important and</text>
  <text start="304.9" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;ve been following this for a very</text>
  <text start="306.099" dur="5.701">long time in this was to make sure we</text>
  <text start="308.53" dur="6.539">understood what the real economy really</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="7.769">was before Trump came into office before</text>
  <text start="315.069" dur="7.53">any of this we knew when Obama was in</text>
  <text start="319.569" dur="6.57">office and we went over the calculations</text>
  <text start="322.599" dur="5.491">of an unemployment GDP and the rest we</text>
  <text start="326.139" dur="5.551">knew that this was a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="328.09" dur="5.97">illusion yes the central bankers knew</text>
  <text start="331.69" dur="4.11">this too yes the mainstream media knew</text>
  <text start="334.06" dur="3.329">this yes the deep state knew this</text>
  <text start="335.8" dur="3.57">because eventually what they were going</text>
  <text start="337.389" dur="4.411">to do is they were going to crash the</text>
  <text start="339.37" dur="5.4">system and blame it on something</text>
  <text start="341.8" dur="4.919">completely different their plans can</text>
  <text start="344.77" dur="4.23">interrupt it with Trump they never</text>
  <text start="346.719" dur="4.17">expected him to win or they really never</text>
  <text start="349" dur="4.62">expected Clinton to lose they thought</text>
  <text start="350.889" dur="5.881">they had everything set up and ready to</text>
  <text start="353.62" dur="4.859">go well they were surprised and shocked</text>
  <text start="356.77" dur="4.56">they didn&amp;#39;t know what was going on and</text>
  <text start="358.479" dur="5.55">what we&amp;#39;re seeing today is the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="361.33" dur="5.429">economy that was set up with this</text>
  <text start="364.029" dur="4.86">illusion it&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart now</text>
  <text start="366.759" dur="4.53">remember they were only able to keep the</text>
  <text start="368.889" dur="4.861">system alive for a short period of time</text>
  <text start="371.289" dur="3.331">before it really started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="373.75" dur="3.15">right now</text>
  <text start="374.62" dur="4.229">and if we look at the housing market we</text>
  <text start="376.9" dur="4.199">can see in the US and we can see all</text>
  <text start="378.849" dur="4.56">around the world the housing market is</text>
  <text start="381.099" dur="4.171">declining very very rapidly in Vancouver</text>
  <text start="383.409" dur="4.081">we are seeing that the market is</text>
  <text start="385.27" dur="4.799">declining very very rapidly right now</text>
  <text start="387.49" dur="6.09">and this really shouldn&amp;#39;t come as a</text>
  <text start="390.069" dur="5.761">surprise to anyone because we know that</text>
  <text start="393.58" dur="5.579">the entire Canadian housing market was</text>
  <text start="395.83" dur="6.269">pumped up with this gigantic inflow of</text>
  <text start="399.159" dur="5.16">funds we know that China was investing</text>
  <text start="402.099" dur="4.32">and this was a big bubble just like in</text>
  <text start="404.319" dur="4.5">Australia just like in the US but Canada</text>
  <text start="406.419" dur="5.43">seems to be one of the biggest bubbles</text>
  <text start="408.819" dur="8.19">that we&amp;#39;ve ever seen and that is falling</text>
  <text start="411.849" dur="8.1">apart right now and as the sales as</text>
  <text start="417.009" dur="6.481">prices as everything else comes down</text>
  <text start="419.949" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re going to see a gigantic disaster</text>
  <text start="423.49" dur="3.39">in the housing market now this is going</text>
  <text start="424.779" dur="6.441">to affect the everyday person because</text>
  <text start="426.88" dur="6.95">remember their house or their condo</text>
  <text start="431.22" dur="6.63">where their townhouse or their apartment</text>
  <text start="433.83" dur="7.68">that they purchased this is their</text>
  <text start="437.85" dur="6.27">biggest investment they&amp;#39;ve ever made</text>
  <text start="441.51" dur="5.91">this is where all of their funds are</text>
  <text start="444.12" dur="6.06">locked up and they&amp;#39;re hoping that their</text>
  <text start="447.42" dur="6.77">real estate investment appreciates over</text>
  <text start="450.18" dur="7.14">time and when it doesn&amp;#39;t this affects</text>
  <text start="454.19" dur="6.58">the everyday person they don&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="457.32" dur="5.64">confident they don&amp;#39;t feel strong they</text>
  <text start="460.77" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t feel like they have extra funds to</text>
  <text start="462.96" dur="5.01">go out and spend and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="465.81" dur="3.84">see this right now we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="467.97" dur="5.99">the real estate market come down and</text>
  <text start="469.65" dur="8.58">people well their optimism in the</text>
  <text start="473.96" dur="7.03">economy is declining yes Trump is using</text>

  <text start="498.87" dur="4.14">those things this is what they look at</text>
  <text start="501.21" dur="4.14">when they&amp;#39;re determining if the</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="4.5">economy&amp;#39;s doing well or not the</text>
  <text start="505.35" dur="5.1">mainstream media uses this to convince</text>

  <text start="513" dur="4.62">mainstream media that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="514.77" dur="5.639">to counter what the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="517.62" dur="5.43">might say about the economy under Trump</text>
  <text start="520.409" dur="4.981">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to argue about the</text>
  <text start="523.05" dur="4.83">economy when you see the stock market at</text>

  <text start="541.77" dur="5.28">and the president knows this now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.95" dur="5.28">very interesting is that the mainstream</text>

  <text start="635.76" dur="4.41">can&amp;#39;t do anything so this is what</text>
  <text start="637.95" dur="5.36">they&amp;#39;re trying to do now this was a plan</text>
  <text start="640.17" dur="5.91">this plan was developed a while ago</text>
  <text start="643.31" dur="5.95">where the central banks were going to</text>
  <text start="646.08" dur="6.48">bring down the economy of the United</text>
  <text start="649.26" dur="6.56">States and then blame this on a war or</text>

  <text start="662.22" dur="5.1">the side of Trump</text>
  <text start="663.54" dur="6.18">I believe he&amp;#39;s doing his bidding just</text>
  <text start="667.32" dur="5.64">like I do believe Mueller at this time</text>
  <text start="669.72" dur="5.42">is doing what Trump wants and we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="672.96" dur="4.68">talking about that in the next report</text>
  <text start="675.14" dur="6.46">but let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="677.64" dur="6.54">the mainstream media has all the Talking</text>
  <text start="681.6" dur="6.06">Heads out there and they even had Ben</text>
  <text start="684.18" dur="5.76">Bernanke out there now remember in 2008</text>
  <text start="687.66" dur="5.25">Ben Bernanke came out listen were not</text>
  <text start="689.94" dur="5.94">forecasting a recession anytime soon he</text>
  <text start="692.91" dur="4.28">said this in 2008 when we entered the</text>

  <text start="697.19" dur="4.11">October of 2008 actually way before that</text>
  <text start="700.07" dur="3.96">but that&amp;#39;s when the stock market came</text>
  <text start="701.3" dur="5.76">down former Fed chair Ben Bernanke said</text>
  <text start="704.03" dur="5.58">the following that the u.s. may soon</text>
  <text start="707.06" dur="5.19">face what&amp;#39;s been called a while eek</text>
  <text start="709.61" dur="4.77">coyote moment as benefits from the Trump</text>
  <text start="712.25" dur="5.55">administration&amp;#39;s various forms of fiscal</text>
  <text start="714.38" dur="5.34">stimulus like the 2017 tax cuts start to</text>
  <text start="717.8" dur="4.86">fade in 2020</text>
  <text start="719.72" dur="6.08">Wile E Coyote is going to go off the</text>
  <text start="722.66" dur="7.92">cliff Ben Bernanke this is what he said</text>
  <text start="725.8" dur="8.77">now all of a sudden he can forecast a</text>
  <text start="730.58" dur="8.43">recession I don&amp;#39;t think so let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="734.57" dur="9.15">post 2575 for a minute this was December</text>
  <text start="739.01" dur="5.64">10th 2018 cue the plan to have the Fed</text>
  <text start="743.72" dur="3.66">raised rates</text>
  <text start="744.65" dur="5.58">this is brackets bold steep incline</text>
  <text start="747.38" dur="4.8">beginning March 2019 in an effort to</text>
  <text start="750.23" dur="4.25">kill the economy prior to 2020</text>
  <text start="752.18" dur="6.17">presidential election is known and</text>
  <text start="754.48" dur="7.27">planned for structure change coming I</text>
  <text start="758.35" dur="6.34">think what&amp;#39;s happening here is Trump is</text>
  <text start="761.75" dur="5.13">using Powell to raise the rates</text>
  <text start="764.69" dur="4.62">yes Powell did come out and say he has</text>
  <text start="766.88" dur="3.78">some flexibility that he might not be</text>
  <text start="769.31" dur="3.21">raising the rates but we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="770.66" dur="4.17">what happens during this year and how</text>
  <text start="772.52" dur="7.14">many more times he raises it and what</text>
  <text start="774.83" dur="8.48">Trump comes out and says q is telling us</text>
  <text start="779.66" dur="6.9">they already know about this plan and</text>
  <text start="783.31" dur="5.65">they have planned for it I think they</text>
  <text start="786.56" dur="4.26">have Powell in there and I believe the</text>
  <text start="788.96" dur="3.6">deep state is building a mainstream</text>
  <text start="790.82" dur="3.24">media is believing that Powell is on</text>
  <text start="792.56" dur="4.17">their side and they&amp;#39;re doing exactly</text>
  <text start="794.06" dur="5.43">what they were that what they had</text>
  <text start="796.73" dur="5.43">planned for a while back where they were</text>
  <text start="799.49" dur="4.86">going to bring the economy down and I</text>
  <text start="802.16" dur="4.65">think what they&amp;#39;re thinking here is that</text>
  <text start="804.35" dur="4.65">okay let them raise rates let them raise</text>
  <text start="806.81" dur="3.15">rates and the economy will come down in</text>
  <text start="809" dur="3.78">2020</text>
  <text start="809.96" dur="5.51">I think q and team have a completely</text>
  <text start="812.78" dur="5.46">different plan and they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
  <text start="815.47" dur="5.38">against them to make them think to make</text>
  <text start="818.24" dur="5.97">them think that they are in control in</text>
  <text start="820.85" dur="4.89">the meantime I do believe Trump is going</text>
  <text start="824.21" dur="2.85">to continually blame the Fed if you</text>
  <text start="825.74" dur="3.93">notice there are news articles out there</text>
  <text start="827.06" dur="3.99">saying that no the Fed is right Trump</text>
  <text start="829.67" dur="3.03">shouldn&amp;#39;t be blaming the Fed</text>
  <text start="831.05" dur="3.63">the Fed knows exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="832.7" dur="4.17">they have to be independent and I</text>
  <text start="834.68" dur="4.58">believe they&amp;#39;re doing the cue Trump</text>
  <text start="836.87" dur="5.43">Patriots they&amp;#39;re doing this on purpose</text>
  <text start="839.26" dur="7.38">to get all of the mainstream media on</text>
  <text start="842.3" dur="7.5">the feds side think about it in this way</text>
  <text start="846.64" dur="5.71">when the economy comes down and the Fed</text>
  <text start="849.8" dur="4.77">continually raised rates and Trump</text>
  <text start="852.35" dur="3.75">blames the Fed and every time they raise</text>
  <text start="854.57" dur="3.45">rates and it comes down and the</text>
  <text start="856.1" dur="5.66">mainstream media is on the side of the</text>
  <text start="858.02" dur="7.26">fed and the entire system collapses</text>
  <text start="861.76" dur="6.58">well the mainstream media the Fed they</text>
  <text start="865.28" dur="5.64">all go down the tubes together because</text>
  <text start="868.34" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re supporting each other even</text>
  <text start="870.92" dur="5.63">though Trump and the Patriots they were</text>
  <text start="874.31" dur="5.61">controlling this whole entire thing</text>
  <text start="876.55" dur="6.37">what&amp;#39;s waiting in the wings now while</text>
  <text start="879.92" dur="5.31">Thomas Massie reintroduced audit the Fed</text>
  <text start="882.92" dur="5.34">bill it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it has to be voted</text>

  <text start="888.26" dur="7.38">people are angry and pissed off they</text>
  <text start="892.43" dur="5.79">will activate this bill and believe me</text>
  <text start="895.64" dur="6.06">it will speed through the house like</text>
  <text start="898.22" dur="5.88">you&amp;#39;ve never seen a bill get passed it</text>
