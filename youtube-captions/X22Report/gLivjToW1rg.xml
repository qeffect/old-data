  <text start="128.52" dur="5.76">the debt level gets way out of hand</text>

  <text start="136.89" dur="5.459">right now firsthand you&amp;#39;re watching the</text>
  <text start="139.319" dur="4.561">central bankers scramble to figure out a</text>
  <text start="142.349" dur="3.061">way in mainstream media and leap say</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re all hooked into this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="3.439">trying to figure out a way to explain</text>
  <text start="147" dur="3.87">why this is happening</text>
  <text start="148.849" dur="6.931">remember this was not part of the plan</text>
  <text start="150.87" dur="8.43">their plan was to have an event it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="155.78" dur="6.16">going to happen they are stuck now and</text>
  <text start="159.3" dur="5.61">they don&amp;#39;t know what to do now if you</text>
  <text start="161.94" dur="5.82">look at the Fed some of the Fed</text>
  <text start="164.91" dur="6.18">Edd&amp;#39;s and these are the bad guys they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="6.96">trying to slow down the collapse time</text>
  <text start="171.09" dur="6.35">remember the plan was in place to</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="5.85">continually push the interest rates and</text>
  <text start="177.44" dur="4.9">they weren&amp;#39;t going to stop this was the</text>
  <text start="180.57" dur="4.17">plan because they were going to give the</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="4.47">economy to trump they were gonna say ooh</text>
  <text start="184.74" dur="4.62">look the economy&amp;#39;s failing under Trump</text>
  <text start="186.81" dur="5.55">and they were going to push the interest</text>
  <text start="189.36" dur="6.12">rates up every single quarter until the</text>
  <text start="192.36" dur="5.25">entire system fell apart they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="195.48" dur="6.6">realize they didn&amp;#39;t understand that</text>
  <text start="197.61" dur="8.13">Trump took control of the economy using</text>
  <text start="202.08" dur="5.19">the magic one I don&amp;#39;t think they thought</text>
  <text start="205.74" dur="4.13">he would figure it out and how to</text>
  <text start="207.27" dur="6.9">manipulate everything how to use their</text>
  <text start="209.87" dur="8.98">manipulation tactics any turn the tables</text>
  <text start="214.17" dur="7.17">on them so right now not just here in</text>
  <text start="218.85" dur="4.85">the United States but globally because</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="5.1">it is a global central bank system</text>
  <text start="223.7" dur="6.46">globally we&amp;#39;re starting to see growth</text>
  <text start="226.44" dur="5.37">slow it&amp;#39;s been slowing all they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="230.16" dur="4.08">doing is manipulating the numbers to</text>
  <text start="231.81" dur="5.16">make us think that growth wasn&amp;#39;t slowing</text>
  <text start="234.24" dur="4.62">before and I don&amp;#39;t know if you remember</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="4.95">this but the IMF was always out there oh</text>
  <text start="238.86" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re gonna see 4% GDP worldwide oh</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re gonna see three point and it</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="3.84">always came down to like 2% well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.03" dur="4.2">getting to the point where their</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="5.22">manipulation can&amp;#39;t even hide the fact</text>
  <text start="250.23" dur="5.569">that everything is slowing and again</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="7.62">we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen in real time</text>
  <text start="255.799" dur="6.881">now out in the UK we are seeing Teresa</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="4.83">May she is struggling right now today</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="6.57">there was a no confidence vote she</text>
  <text start="265.2" dur="6.719">barely escaped that and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="5.419">seeing right now is the EU they are not</text>
  <text start="271.919" dur="7.441">bending they&amp;#39;ll extend the time period</text>
  <text start="274.669" dur="7.181">but they will not give on the deal now</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="5.01">what I think the central bankers really</text>
  <text start="281.85" dur="5.1">want I really think they want this</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="6.51">brexit deal completely cancelled and I</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="6.48">think they want a new vote this way they</text>
  <text start="290.88" dur="4.86">can manipulate it more so than they did</text>
  <text start="293.43" dur="3.87">in the past to try to get everyone to</text>
  <text start="295.74" dur="2.73">say oh yeah you know what that whole</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="2.85">brexit thing you</text>
  <text start="298.47" dur="3.87">yeah we don&amp;#39;t want it now we see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.15" dur="4.53">not working out and I do believe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.34" dur="5.55">trying to push this now May is gonna</text>
  <text start="304.68" dur="4.89">push ahead with her negotiations she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.89" dur="3.72">trying she&amp;#39;s gonna try to get this</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="4.92">brexit deal passed because it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="311.61" dur="5.28">not a brexit deal it&amp;#39;s all in favor to</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="4.86">the central bank it&amp;#39;s not in favor to</text>
  <text start="316.89" dur="5.19">the people and this is not really a</text>
  <text start="319.35" dur="8">great deal even Makran was out there</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="10.17">saying listen either we do this deal or</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="8.23">that&amp;#39;s it we cannot do any more because</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="5.46">the EU has reached the maximum of what</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="4.23">it can offer the UK and will not</text>
  <text start="337.71" dur="6.63">sacrifice European interest to help the</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="6.45">UK resolve its internal squabbles it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.34" dur="3.3">not really an internal squabble the</text>
  <text start="346.26" dur="4.47">people want something completely</text>
  <text start="347.64" dur="6.3">different the government who represent</text>
  <text start="350.73" dur="5.4">the people they&amp;#39;re voting down what may</text>
  <text start="353.94" dur="6.39">and the central bankers are presenting</text>
  <text start="356.13" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re saying this doesn&amp;#39;t work we want</text>
  <text start="360.33" dur="5.22">something completely different but again</text>
  <text start="362.61" dur="5.1">all these deep state operatives they</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="4.65">can&amp;#39;t see anything well I can&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="4.11">they just don&amp;#39;t want to acknowledge it</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="4.529">because they&amp;#39;re gonna continually push</text>
  <text start="371.82" dur="5.13">their agenda they don&amp;#39;t care what the</text>
  <text start="374.729" dur="4.051">people say they never have they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="376.95" dur="4.95">have an allegiance to a country or group</text>
  <text start="378.78" dur="7.199">the allegiance in to is to themselves to</text>
  <text start="381.9" dur="5.91">the central bank to the elite so what do</text>
  <text start="385.979" dur="4.641">we see happening right now well the</text>
  <text start="387.81" dur="6.39">entire world right now is slowing down</text>
  <text start="390.62" dur="5.68">the global economy is slowing down now</text>
  <text start="394.2" dur="4.11">again I&amp;#39;ll say this again this has</text>
  <text start="396.3" dur="3.33">nothing to do with Trump the global</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="2.73">economy and this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="399.63" dur="2.97">tracking it this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="401.04" dur="3.48">following it we weren&amp;#39;t doing it to</text>
  <text start="402.6" dur="3.42">predict the collapse we knew there was a</text>
  <text start="404.52" dur="3.75">collapse coming we just didn&amp;#39;t know when</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="4.709">it was gonna happen we didn&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="408.27" dur="4.709">much ammunition the central bank was</text>
  <text start="410.729" dur="4.531">going to use to keep the system afloat</text>
  <text start="412.979" dur="6.121">and again they never expected Trump to</text>
  <text start="415.26" dur="5.94">win and we&amp;#39;ve been following it to show</text>
  <text start="419.1" dur="3.84">that this economy this way we can go</text>
  <text start="421.2" dur="4.62">back in time we could show that this</text>
  <text start="422.94" dur="5.31">economy is an adjunct is in one gigantic</text>
  <text start="425.82" dur="5.25">illusion and everything that they throw</text>

  <text start="436.08" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;ve been doing this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="438.43" dur="5.52">now the mainstream media they are now</text>
  <text start="441.9" dur="5.05">shifting their narrative as they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="443.95" dur="4.17">trying to go down this track and here</text>
  <text start="446.95" dur="3.33">are some of the articles and it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="491.5" dur="4.08">reporting on for a very long time this</text>
  <text start="493.57" dur="5.81">is why they&amp;#39;ll never go after those</text>

  <text start="554.23" dur="4.92">going to have an event to cover this up</text>

  <text start="561.77" dur="5.07">and what they&amp;#39;re seeing right now and</text>
  <text start="564.92" dur="3.93">this is because of Trump also they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="566.84" dur="5.88">seeing that every time they do it</text>

  <text start="572.72" dur="4.14">says I made the economy great every time</text>
  <text start="574.52" dur="6.36">the Fed raises the rates they destroy</text>

  <text start="607.04" dur="4.47">and that&amp;#39;s why they raise the interest</text>
  <text start="609.14" dur="5.34">rates very very slowly so nobody catches</text>
  <text start="611.51" dur="4.68">on to what is happening the plan went</text>
  <text start="614.48" dur="3.45">down the tubes when Trump started to</text>
