  <text start="51.809" dur="6.27">episode 1106 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="55.26" dur="6.15">October 20th 2016 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="58.079" dur="6.33">episode is the entire economy is at a</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="6.27">tipping point let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="64.409" dur="6.391">economic collapse financial news we are</text>
  <text start="67.68" dur="6.71">at that point where we&amp;#39;re at a tipping</text>
  <text start="70.8" dur="7.65">point where we&amp;#39;re on the cusp of</text>
  <text start="74.39" dur="6.97">collapsing and we can see that around</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="6.089">the world the debt level is so high that</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="4.8">countries are collapsing right now I</text>
  <text start="84.539" dur="3.921">know the corporate media is really not</text>
  <text start="86.16" dur="5.76">really reporting on any of this I know</text>
  <text start="88.46" dur="5.53">people don&amp;#39;t really talk about this but</text>
  <text start="91.92" dur="5.4">when we look around the world we see</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="8.64">France we see Greece we see Spain Italy</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="8.359">Germany we&amp;#39;re seeing countries slide</text>
  <text start="102.63" dur="4.98">into a recession other countries are</text>
  <text start="105.679" dur="5.641">collapsing right in front of our eyes</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="8.119">and when we look at Greece for instance</text>
  <text start="111.32" dur="7.6">we can see that Greece has many many</text>
  <text start="115.729" dur="7.42">bailouts from the central banks where</text>
  <text start="118.92" dur="7.739">they gave them more and more debt and it</text>
  <text start="123.149" dur="6.391">has taken a toll on people and has taken</text>
  <text start="126.659" dur="6.091">a toll on businesses in Greece has taken</text>
  <text start="129.54" dur="7.71">a toll on the country itself and right</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="9.72">now the self-employed in Greece they</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="8.48">have very high taxes very high social</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="6.329">security contributions each year and</text>
  <text start="145.73" dur="5.86">many in Greece are looking at this and</text>
  <text start="148.799" dur="5.75">saying there is no reason to keep our</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="5.78">business inside of Greece anymore and</text>
  <text start="154.549" dur="9.541">they&amp;#39;re moving their businesses to</text>
  <text start="157.37" dur="11.41">Bulgaria because their taxes are at 10%</text>
  <text start="164.09" dur="10.54">instead of 29% social security</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="9.209">contributions are very low and as of</text>
  <text start="174.63" dur="4.06">right now there are 60,000 businesses</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="5.381">that</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="8.22">moved out of Greece and this is what</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="8.48">happens when you raise the taxes when</text>
  <text start="186.91" dur="9.48">you put these rules into place where</text>
  <text start="191.85" dur="9.76">businesses people cannot meet them it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.39" dur="7.32">an impossible situation and what happens</text>
  <text start="201.61" dur="5.24">is the company eventually or the person</text>
  <text start="203.71" dur="5.49">eventually decides enough is enough</text>
  <text start="206.85" dur="5.74">those people who are getting hit with</text>
  <text start="209.2" dur="5.55">FATCA in the United States well they say</text>
  <text start="212.59" dur="4.26">you know what I&amp;#39;m not gonna be a citizen</text>
  <text start="214.75" dur="6.18">of the United States because it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="5.94">too much corporations businesses that</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="5.19">are in the United States and being taxed</text>
  <text start="222.79" dur="6.54">heavenly heavily they move out of the</text>
  <text start="226.12" dur="6.72">United States to find cheaper labor less</text>
  <text start="229.33" dur="4.86">taxes this is why manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="232.84" dur="3.93">completely gone here in the United</text>
  <text start="234.19" dur="7.31">States this is why a lot of businesses</text>
  <text start="236.77" dur="8.43">have closed this is why the economy is</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="9.959">stalling right now and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="9.24">is people well they don&amp;#39;t have jobs I</text>
  <text start="251.459" dur="6.221">know the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="254.44" dur="5.13">they manipulate a lot of the numbers to</text>
  <text start="257.68" dur="3.8">make us believe that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="259.57" dur="5.849">and believe me there&amp;#39;s a lot of people</text>
  <text start="261.48" dur="8.65">that do believe that the economy is</text>
  <text start="265.419" dur="6.471">doing well because all they have to do</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="5.37">is manipulate the stock market</text>
  <text start="271.89" dur="7.33">manipulate unemployment manipulate</text>
  <text start="275.5" dur="7.11">initial jobless claims manipulate GDP</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="6.21">and people will believe whatever the</text>
  <text start="282.61" dur="4.49">government tells them that the economy</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="5.64">is doing well we have recovered fully</text>
  <text start="287.1" dur="7.09">we&amp;#39;re on the right track and people go</text>
  <text start="291.07" dur="6.18">along with this but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="294.19" dur="6.21">lately is the manipulated numbers well</text>
  <text start="297.25" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re not working in many cases for</text>
  <text start="300.4" dur="5.76">example initial jobless claims they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="302.8" dur="8.1">jumped over five percent this is the</text>
  <text start="306.16" dur="6.9">biggest weekly rise since May</text>
  <text start="310.9" dur="4.68">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="6.33">as more and more people lose their jobs</text>
  <text start="315.58" dur="8.46">this number is getting very difficult to</text>
  <text start="319.39" dur="7.02">keep down in the range where everyone</text>
  <text start="324.04" dur="5.88">says everyone has a job and no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.41" dur="4.68">applying for unemployment and eventually</text>
  <text start="329.92" dur="5.22">what&amp;#39;s going to happen it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="4.47">break out because again it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="335.14" dur="5.07">sense</text>
  <text start="335.56" dur="8.01">and we know that the people around the</text>
  <text start="340.21" dur="5.37">country there&amp;#39;s definitely something not</text>
  <text start="343.57" dur="5.7">right about the economy because we see</text>
  <text start="345.58" dur="6.36">consumer confidence is unchanged since</text>
  <text start="349.27" dur="5.07">two years ago and two years ago</text>
  <text start="351.94" dur="5.94">unemployment was what ten percent now</text>
  <text start="354.34" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re at five it&amp;#39;s half so why wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="357.88" dur="6.15">people think that things are getting</text>
  <text start="360.16" dur="5.61">better because I mean the president</text>
  <text start="364.03" dur="3.72">tells us that we&amp;#39;re completely recovered</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s if you don&amp;#39;t believe me you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="367.75" dur="5.4">peddling fiction but we can see from the</text>
  <text start="371.26" dur="4.89">real economic data from the real</text>
  <text start="373.15" dur="5.25">information that we look at the economy</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="4.8">is actually in a recession right now it</text>
  <text start="378.4" dur="6.69">has not improved whatsoever I mean yes</text>
  <text start="380.95" dur="6.84">when you take people and you throw them</text>
  <text start="385.09" dur="4.38">off the unemployment numbers and you say</text>
  <text start="387.79" dur="3.84">yeah yeah those couple hundred million</text>
  <text start="389.47" dur="3.84">people they don&amp;#39;t want jobs we just</text>
  <text start="391.63" dur="5.04">won&amp;#39;t count them look around employment</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="7.62">5% for 94.9 percent let&amp;#39;s go and lower</text>
  <text start="396.67" dur="6.57">and lower when you take GDP and you try</text>
  <text start="400.93" dur="4.59">to manipulate it as best you can throw</text>
  <text start="403.24" dur="5.79">in health insurance right make those</text>
  <text start="405.52" dur="8.34">premiums go up show people that are you</text>
  <text start="409.03" dur="8.46">know that that everyone is spending the</text>
  <text start="413.86" dur="6.39">whole thing&amp;#39;s fake because health</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="5.24">insurance does not contribute to really</text>
  <text start="420.25" dur="4.59">GDP doesn&amp;#39;t contribute to anything here</text>
  <text start="422.73" dur="3.46">raising the premiums doesn&amp;#39;t show that</text>
  <text start="424.84" dur="2.97">people are spending more money just</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="5.25">shows they have to pay more money for</text>
  <text start="427.81" dur="6.45">health insurance and we can see right</text>
  <text start="431.44" dur="6.84">now that we have so many bubbles around</text>
  <text start="434.26" dur="7.53">the country around the world they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="438.28" dur="6.51">getting ready to pop and we see that</text>
  <text start="441.79" dur="7.23">home sales they&amp;#39;re declining</text>
  <text start="444.79" dur="5.73">new home sales declining and the</text>
  <text start="449.02" dur="5.79">corporate media today is making a really</text>
  <text start="450.52" dur="8.22">big deal that existing home sales have</text>
  <text start="454.81" dur="6.72">surged we&amp;#39;re back on track well no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="458.74" dur="7.89">not because think about what happened</text>
  <text start="461.53" dur="11.1">here existing home sales went from 5.6</text>
  <text start="466.63" dur="11.28">all the way down to 5.3 and then move</text>
  <text start="472.63" dur="7.47">backed up to 5.5 point four seven so</text>
  <text start="477.91" dur="6.78">existing homes are not surging anywhere</text>
  <text start="480.1" dur="6.45">we&amp;#39;re back to the same level as we were</text>
  <text start="484.69" dur="4.7">back in June of 2015</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="6.83">and we&amp;#39;ve just been bouncing around</text>
  <text start="489.39" dur="6.58">existing home sales are not surging</text>
  <text start="493.38" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re stagnant they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="5.25">anywhere</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="5.08">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="501.22" dur="4.91">this is the third month in a row that</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="8.87">sales of previously owned homes are flat</text>
  <text start="506.13" dur="11.2">year-over-year so when we look at the</text>
  <text start="511.89" dur="10.33">economy all together we see that the</text>
  <text start="517.33" dur="8.82">manipulated numbers are trying to show</text>
  <text start="522.22" dur="7.11">everyone that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery if you</text>
  <text start="526.15" dur="6.51">take away the manipulation and you add</text>
  <text start="529.33" dur="8.16">all those people back for unemployment</text>
  <text start="532.66" dur="7.68">if you get rid of health insurance with</text>
  <text start="537.49" dur="6.27">the premiums skyrocketing and you take</text>
  <text start="540.34" dur="5.55">that out of GDP we have GDP in the</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="4.8">negative range if you add those people</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="5.19">back in who don&amp;#39;t have a job all of a</text>
  <text start="548.56" dur="9.18">sudden unemployment and you use the</text>
  <text start="551.08" dur="11.24">calculation back in the early 90s we see</text>
  <text start="557.74" dur="4.58">unemployment is at like 20-25 percent</text>
  <text start="563.37" dur="10.11">the manipulation manipulated the way we</text>
  <text start="568.45" dur="8.03">view the economy the economy is still</text>
  <text start="573.48" dur="3">deteriorating</text>
  <text start="576.55" dur="6.45">and they can&amp;#39;t stop it this is the</text>
  <text start="580.149" dur="5.971">biggest problem they can pretend they</text>
  <text start="583" dur="8.07">can keep the illusion alive but they</text>
  <text start="586.12" dur="8.58">cannot stop the underlying problem of</text>
  <text start="591.07" dur="7.25">the economy people are out of work we</text>
  <text start="594.7" dur="8.879">have no manufacturing the debt level is</text>
  <text start="598.32" dur="7.93">way too high it cannot be sustained the</text>
  <text start="603.579" dur="5.331">interest rates are close to zero around</text>
  <text start="606.25" dur="6.75">the world they&amp;#39;re in the negative range</text>
  <text start="608.91" dur="7.41">the Fed has trillions of toxic real</text>
  <text start="613" dur="7.32">estate and Treasury bonds on its books</text>
  <text start="616.32" dur="7.209">they are continually creating currency</text>
  <text start="620.32" dur="5.82">out of thin air corporate defaults are</text>
  <text start="623.529" dur="9.391">on the rise delinquencies are on the</text>
  <text start="626.14" dur="9.02">rise auto sales are declining think</text>
  <text start="632.92" dur="5.37">about what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="635.16" dur="7.36">industrial production is declining it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="638.29" dur="7.5">signaling a recession all of this is</text>
  <text start="642.52" dur="6.09">happening all at once so what you have</text>
  <text start="645.79" dur="5.46">is the real economic indicators and then</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="6.78">you have their illusion and their</text>
  <text start="651.25" dur="6.51">illusion is not working anymore this is</text>
  <text start="655.39" dur="5.009">why consumer confidence is declining</text>
  <text start="657.76" dur="8.01">because people realize there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="660.399" dur="8.371">wrong we see that the ECB is out there</text>
  <text start="665.77" dur="5.22">and they are saying they have no</text>
  <text start="668.77" dur="7.23">evidence whatsoever of any bubbles</text>
  <text start="670.99" dur="7.289">forming anywhere nothing actually the</text>
  <text start="676" dur="7.29">Federal Reserve has said the same exact</text>
  <text start="678.279" dur="8.791">thing there are no bubbles actually if I</text>
  <text start="683.29" dur="5.43">remember correctly back in 2008 they</text>
  <text start="687.07" dur="2.69">told us everything was fine there were</text>
  <text start="688.72" dur="3.63">no bubbles</text>
  <text start="689.76" dur="7.59">everything was contained the subprime</text>
  <text start="692.35" dur="5">was contained everything was fine and</text>
  <text start="697.529" dur="6.791">with the subprime back in 2008 hundreds</text>
  <text start="701.98" dur="6">of millions of people the government the</text>
  <text start="704.32" dur="5.85">central bankers they kept the illusion</text>
  <text start="707.98" dur="3.87">alive that the economy was doing well</text>
  <text start="710.17" dur="3.65">they didn&amp;#39;t even give any type of</text>
  <text start="711.85" dur="4.83">indication that something was wrong</text>
  <text start="713.82" dur="5.11">there were a few who said there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="716.68" dur="4.469">something wrong who are out there trying</text>
  <text start="718.93" dur="3.659">to get the word out that this</text>
  <text start="721.149" dur="3.511">real-estate market is gonna come</text>
  <text start="722.589" dur="4.021">tumbling down actually people even made</text>
  <text start="724.66" dur="4.89">bets they shorted the market people</text>
  <text start="726.61" dur="4.62">laughed at them you&amp;#39;re crazy I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="729.55" dur="3.3">go with the hundred millions people the</text>
  <text start="731.23" dur="6.299">government and the central bank because</text>
  <text start="732.85" dur="7.739">I believe them those people couldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="737.529" dur="4.981">woken up no matter what you have done at</text>
  <text start="740.589" dur="3.781">that point they would have still</text>
  <text start="742.51" dur="3.87">believed the government they would have</text>
  <text start="744.37" dur="3.51">still believed the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="746.38" dur="6.959">would have still believed at the central</text>
  <text start="747.88" dur="7.8">bank no one would believe the few that</text>
  <text start="753.339" dur="5.131">said the economy is failing today we</text>
  <text start="755.68" dur="4.83">have the same thing the few are out</text>
  <text start="758.47" dur="3.9">there saying there&amp;#39;s something wrong</text>
  <text start="760.51" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="762.37" dur="6.779">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this economy we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="766.3" dur="6.3">in a recession but the hundreds of</text>
  <text start="769.149" dur="5.491">millions of people they believe the</text>
  <text start="772.6" dur="5.669">government they believe everything they</text>
  <text start="774.64" dur="6.36">say they believe the central bank they</text>
  <text start="778.269" dur="5.82">believe the corporate media they believe</text>
  <text start="781" dur="5.519">up to the point when the entire system</text>
  <text start="784.089" dur="5.221">is collapsing and then they continually</text>
  <text start="786.519" dur="4.551">they will continually believe that the</text>
  <text start="789.31" dur="7.13">government will then rescue them</text>
  <text start="791.07" dur="8.769">from the collapse that they created and</text>
  <text start="796.44" dur="8.139">guess what the government never rescues</text>
  <text start="799.839" dur="8.071">anybody they rescue their banks they</text>
  <text start="804.579" dur="6.921">rescue their friends they rescue the</text>
  <text start="807.91" dur="6.119">elite they mold the system and</text>
  <text start="811.5" dur="6.94">manipulate the system to bring in more</text>
  <text start="814.029" dur="6.391">funds to themselves so we&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="818.44" dur="6.45">tipping point right now where this</text>
  <text start="820.42" dur="6.84">entire system is about to implode and</text>
  <text start="824.89" dur="3.15">guess what there&amp;#39;s hundreds of millions</text>
  <text start="827.26" dur="4.379">of people</text>
  <text start="828.04" dur="5.789">you can try to convince them they cannot</text>
  <text start="831.639" dur="6.541">be woken up right now they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
