  <text start="64.199" dur="5.551">disaster let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>

  <text start="78.57" dur="7.86">david weprin and a Senate bill 4561 by</text>
  <text start="83.49" dur="5.34">state senator Tony Avella and these New</text>
  <text start="86.43" dur="5.67">York politicians will require people to</text>
  <text start="88.83" dur="5.91">remove inaccurate irrelevant inadequate</text>
  <text start="92.1" dur="5.519">or excessive statements about others so</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="4.83">within 30 days this bill says of a</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="3.801">request from an individual all search</text>

  <text start="114.99" dur="4.29">takedown notice now basically what</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re doing here is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="119.28" dur="5.699">controlling speech and they also want to</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="5.94">do the following now if material is not</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="6.871">current to public debate or discourse</text>
  <text start="127.68" dur="6.93">and it&amp;#39;s not relevant anymore they want</text>
  <text start="131.85" dur="4.889">that information taken down now failure</text>
  <text start="134.61" dur="4.409">to comply with this would make the</text>
  <text start="136.739" dur="4.591">search engines or speakers liable for at</text>

  <text start="147.33" dur="5.82">works copies of books on google books</text>
  <text start="149.82" dur="6.93">and Amazon encyclopedias online</text>
  <text start="153.15" dur="5.97">encyclopedias now if a judge and a jury</text>
  <text start="156.75" dur="4.26">found that the speech was no longer</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="4.05">material to current public debate or</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="4.02">discourse well it would all have to be</text>
  <text start="163.17" dur="4.14">removed and the bill contains no</text>
  <text start="165.03" dur="4.41">exceptions even for material of genuine</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="4.23">historical interest but the deeper</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="4.65">problem with the bill is simply that it</text>
  <text start="171.54" dur="5.25">aims to censor what people say under a</text>
  <text start="174.09" dur="4.56">broad vague test based on what the</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="4.68">government thinks the public should or</text>
  <text start="178.65" dur="4.71">shouldn&amp;#39;t be discussing and again this</text>
  <text start="181.47" dur="3.9">is trying to control speech once again</text>
  <text start="183.36" dur="2.91">you notice with all these bills and</text>
  <text start="185.37" dur="3.24">everything that they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="186.27" dur="5.1">with political correctness all they want</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="4.8">to do and they continually try they want</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="5.1">to control what we&amp;#39;re saying what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="193.41" dur="6.78">thinking what we&amp;#39;re doing and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="6.27">their job because nothing overrides the</text>
  <text start="200.19" dur="6.15">First Amendment that is the law of the</text>
  <text start="202.74" dur="5.61">land and if we don&amp;#39;t support it and we</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="4.26">believe that these laws if they should</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="4.29">ever pass hopefully not if we believe</text>
  <text start="210.6" dur="4.32">that these are the laws then guess what</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;ve just given up that right they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="3.81">going to tell you you&amp;#39;ve given it up</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="3.51">even though you can&amp;#39;t give up a right so</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="3.18">we all have to say there nope we still</text>
  <text start="220.2" dur="3.6">have the First Amendment that law does</text>
  <text start="221.91" dur="3.6">not pertain it&amp;#39;s in violation of the</text>
  <text start="223.8" dur="5.82">First Amendment now a couple days ago</text>

  <text start="229.62" dur="5.73">talking about how GCHQ well they were</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="4.44">the ones who got the information for</text>
  <text start="235.35" dur="3.99">Obama then Sean Spicer was fielding</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="3.87">questions from reporters he also</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="6.03">mentioned it with other individuals now</text>
  <text start="241.53" dur="6.239">the UK spy agency GCHQ he they came out</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="5.399">and said no this is ridiculous this</text>
  <text start="247.769" dur="6.061">never happened now this came this whole</text>
  <text start="250.769" dur="5.701">thing came about because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="253.83" dur="4.589">evidence as of yet Trump has not</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="3.93">produced anything so many of these</text>
  <text start="258.419" dur="4.411">individuals were getting their</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="4.59">information from different sources who</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="4.92">said yes we know exactly what happened</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="4.53">and they put it out there again not</text>
  <text start="267.75" dur="4.38">backing it up with any type of proof at</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="5.79">all so at once again we have an</text>
  <text start="272.13" dur="5.849">intelligence source unnamed nobody knows</text>
  <text start="275.31" dur="6.78">who it is this person said that Spicer</text>
  <text start="277.979" dur="7.411">and general McMaster they apologized to</text>
  <text start="282.09" dur="6.24">Britain general McMaster contacted Sir</text>

  <text start="288.33" dur="4.74">national security adviser to apologize</text>
  <text start="290.669" dur="4.881">for the comments mr. Spicer conveyed his</text>
  <text start="293.07" dur="5.73">apology through sir Kim Darroch</text>
  <text start="295.55" dur="5.05">Britain&amp;#39;s US ambassador but again we</text>
  <text start="298.8" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t have any proof that they actually</text>
  <text start="300.6" dur="4.26">did this maybe they did maybe they</text>
  <text start="302.64" dur="5.279">didn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s really not important because</text>
  <text start="304.86" dur="5.28">what is important is that this one</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="5.75">statement that they said the spokesman</text>
  <text start="310.14" dur="6.52">added that it would be impossible for</text>
  <text start="313.669" dur="4.581">GCHQ to spy on mr. Trump as</text>
  <text start="316.66" dur="4.5">both countries are members of the five</text>
  <text start="318.25" dur="5.91">eyes alliance now the question is what</text>
  <text start="321.16" dur="4.68">is 5i well the five eyes Alliance it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="324.16" dur="4.14">secretive global surveillance</text>
  <text start="325.84" dur="4.95">arrangement of states comprised of the</text>

  <text start="343.21" dur="6.99">New Zealand government communication</text>
  <text start="345.82" dur="7.71">security bureau GCSB and here&amp;#39;s what we</text>
  <text start="350.2" dur="5.85">know about the five eyes under the</text>
  <text start="353.53" dur="5.15">agreement interception collection</text>
  <text start="356.05" dur="5.1">acquisition analysis and decryption is</text>
  <text start="358.68" dur="4.03">conducted by each of the state parties</text>
  <text start="361.15" dur="5.04">in their respective parts of the globe</text>
  <text start="362.71" dur="7.56">and all intelligence all the information</text>
  <text start="366.19" dur="6.3">is then shared by default the agreement</text>
  <text start="370.27" dur="4.5">is widened scope and establishes</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="4.56">jointly-run operation centers or</text>
  <text start="374.77" dur="4.29">operatives from multiple intelligent</text>
  <text start="377.05" dur="5.58">agencies of the five eyes States work</text>
  <text start="379.06" dur="5.85">alongside each other together the five</text>
  <text start="382.63" dur="5.07">eyes collaborated develop specific</text>
  <text start="384.91" dur="4.95">technical programs of collection and</text>
  <text start="387.7" dur="4.29">analysis one senior member of Britain&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.86" dur="5.94">intelligence community said when you get</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="6.84">a GCHQ pass it gives you access to the</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="5.7">NSA to you can walk into the NSA and</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="5.1">find GCHQ staff holding senior</text>
  <text start="401.5" dur="4.41">management positions and vice versa when</text>
  <text start="403.93" dur="5.04">the NSA has a piece of intelligence it</text>
  <text start="405.91" dur="5.25">will very often ask GCHQ for a second</text>
  <text start="408.97" dur="3.93">opinion there have been up and downs</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="5.52">over the years of course but in general</text>
  <text start="412.9" dur="6.99">the NSA and gchq are extremely close in</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="6.75">the relationship they rely on each other</text>
  <text start="419.89" dur="6.51">so despite rumors of a no spy packed</text>
  <text start="423.43" dur="5.76">there is no prohibition on intelligence</text>
  <text start="426.4" dur="6.269">gathering by 5i states on the citizens</text>
  <text start="429.19" dur="6.39">or residents of other five I states very</text>
  <text start="432.669" dur="6.061">interesting so they&amp;#39;re saying because</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="6.33">there are five I state that it would be</text>
  <text start="438.73" dur="6.12">impossible to get the information well</text>
  <text start="441.91" dur="6.509">not from what we know about them they</text>
  <text start="444.85" dur="5.61">share everything so really most likely</text>
  <text start="448.419" dur="4.731">they&amp;#39;d probably pass the law</text>
  <text start="450.46" dur="6.239">the information because we know that</text>
  <text start="453.15" dur="6.1">spies lie do you really think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.699" dur="5.911">going to come out and say yes we gave</text>
  <text start="459.25" dur="5.31">this to the United States know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.61" dur="4.08">going to lie on top of the line look</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="4.38">what happened with clapper here in the</text>
  <text start="466.69" dur="4.949">United States when he went in front of</text>
  <text start="468.94" dur="6.03">Congress and they add some point like</text>
  <text start="471.639" dur="4.62">are you spying on the American people he</text>
  <text start="474.97" dur="4.5">looked him straight in the face and said</text>
  <text start="476.259" dur="4.681">absolutely not and then we come to find</text>
  <text start="479.47" dur="3">out that he lied because there was other</text>
  <text start="480.94" dur="3.449">information and they did a little</text>
  <text start="482.47" dur="3.569">investigation and it showed that yes</text>
  <text start="484.389" dur="4.381">they were spying on the American people</text>
  <text start="486.039" dur="4.771">and he had to change his story they lie</text>
  <text start="488.77" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re not going to tell you the truth</text>
  <text start="490.81" dur="6.479">unless you have facts and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="494.5" dur="5.61">former CIA officer out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.289" dur="5.011">saying that CIA agents they are taught</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="6.059">to lie and if you get caught up in a lie</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="7.049">lie on top of that the primary mission</text>
  <text start="506.169" dur="6.391">is to protect the agency not the</text>
  <text start="509.349" dur="6.511">Constitution not the people but the spy</text>
  <text start="512.56" dur="5.43">agency most likely all the other spy</text>
  <text start="515.86" dur="4.289">agencies around the world have the same</text>
  <text start="517.99" dur="5.099">type of agreement where they protect</text>
  <text start="520.149" dur="7.111">themselves where they&amp;#39;re taught to lie</text>
  <text start="523.089" dur="6.87">this is what spies do they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="527.26" dur="4.68">for themselves they&amp;#39;re not working in</text>
  <text start="529.959" dur="4.38">the best interest of the people they</text>
  <text start="531.94" dur="5.04">tell you they are but it&amp;#39;s a lie so when</text>
  <text start="534.339" dur="5.25">you hear GCHQ come out and say this is</text>
  <text start="536.98" dur="5.49">ridiculous there is no way because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.589" dur="5.071">five eyes community well they share</text>
  <text start="542.47" dur="3.809">everything they have access to the NSA</text>
  <text start="544.66" dur="3.57">database now what&amp;#39;s even more</text>
  <text start="546.279" dur="5.101">interesting about all of it when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.23" dur="6.93">talking about these FISA warrants if we</text>
  <text start="551.38" dur="5.699">go back to October of 2016 this is</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="3.78">coming from heat street there are two</text>
  <text start="557.079" dur="4.021">separate sources with links to the</text>
  <text start="558.94" dur="4.41">counter intelligence community and they</text>
  <text start="561.1" dur="5.37">have confirmed to heat Street that the</text>
  <text start="563.35" dur="6.12">FBI sought and was granted a pfizer</text>
  <text start="566.47" dur="4.679">court warrant in October giving</text>
  <text start="569.47" dur="4.76">counterintelligence permission to</text>
  <text start="571.149" dur="5.761">examine the activities of us persons in</text>
  <text start="574.23" dur="5.95">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s campaign with ties to</text>
  <text start="576.91" dur="5.369">Russia now contrary to early reporting</text>
  <text start="580.18" dur="3.78">the New York Times which cited FBI</text>
  <text start="582.279" dur="4.051">sources that saying that the</text>
  <text start="583.96" dur="4.65">did not believe that the private server</text>
  <text start="586.33" dur="4.29">and Donald Trump Tower which was</text>
  <text start="588.61" dur="3.84">connected to Russia bank had any</text>
  <text start="590.62" dur="5.16">nefarious purpose the FBI&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="592.45" dur="7.08">counterintelligence arm sources say well</text>
  <text start="595.78" dur="6.78">they got a pfizer court request around</text>
  <text start="599.53" dur="6.56">possible financial and banking offenses</text>
  <text start="602.56" dur="6.99">related to the server his name was not</text>
  <text start="606.09" dur="6.19">specifically on it but this is how they</text>
  <text start="609.55" dur="5.88">got the FISA warrant the first request</text>
  <text start="612.28" dur="4.92">which sources say named Trump was denied</text>
  <text start="615.43" dur="4.5">we talked about this before this was</text>
  <text start="617.2" dur="5.16">back in June but the second was drawn</text>
  <text start="619.93" dur="5.09">more narrowly and was granted in October</text>
  <text start="622.36" dur="4.77">after evidence was presented of a server</text>
  <text start="625.02" dur="5.32">possibly related to the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="627.13" dur="6.66">and its alleged links to two banks the</text>
  <text start="630.34" dur="6">sv b bank and russia&amp;#39;s alpha bank so</text>
  <text start="633.79" dur="5.43">this is very interesting because they</text>
  <text start="636.34" dur="5.55">probably took this and then used it to</text>
  <text start="639.22" dur="4.92">spy on Trump but it doesn&amp;#39;t have his</text>
  <text start="641.89" dur="4.22">Trump name on there and it shows that he</text>
  <text start="644.14" dur="5.4">was they were looking into the</text>
  <text start="646.11" dur="6.13">connection of the two servers so what</text>
  <text start="649.54" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that there is a</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="5.22">paper trail of some sorts now i&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="655.42" dur="4.83">the trump administration they need to</text>
  <text start="657.46" dur="7.29">put all this together to show the links</text>
  <text start="660.25" dur="5.91">between Obama the FBI GCHQ and most</text>
  <text start="664.75" dur="3.12">likely this is what they&amp;#39;re working on</text>
  <text start="666.16" dur="3.24">if they can&amp;#39;t come up with any type of</text>
  <text start="667.87" dur="3.09">evidence well there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="669.4" dur="3.03">problem the corporate media is going to</text>
  <text start="670.96" dur="3.12">be all over him he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="672.43" dur="4.98">considered a liar no one&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="674.08" dur="7.23">believe them ever again so we see at</text>
  <text start="677.41" dur="6.66">this point that they do have some type</text>
  <text start="681.31" dur="4.83">of paper trail it might not have Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="684.07" dur="5.16">name on it but it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="686.14" dur="6.81">getting closer now today there was a</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="6.57">laptop that was stolen from a Secret</text>
  <text start="692.95" dur="4.8">Service agent now the laptop contained</text>

  <text start="704.05" dur="3.66">national security information and it was</text>
  <text start="706.18" dur="4.08">stolen from a Secret Service agent</text>
  <text start="707.71" dur="4.32">vehicle in Brooklyn now the Secret</text>
  <text start="710.26" dur="3.71">Service reported the laptop containing</text>

  <text start="723.76" dur="4.5">foreign leaders asteroid on laptop well</text>
  <text start="726.16" dur="5.22">the information on there could</text>
  <text start="728.26" dur="5.46">compromise national security now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="731.38" dur="3.69">very interesting that this was stolen</text>
  <text start="733.72" dur="3.96">because there are two things on there</text>
  <text start="735.07" dur="5.24">Clinton email probe and the layout of</text>
  <text start="737.68" dur="5.07">Trump Tower which leads us to believe is</text>
  <text start="740.31" dur="5.07">something being planned because they</text>
  <text start="742.75" dur="6.24">knew exactly where to get this laptop</text>
  <text start="745.38" dur="6.22">they knew exactly that these two things</text>
  <text start="748.99" dur="5.76">were on there and they stole it from a</text>
  <text start="751.6" dur="6.03">Secret Service agent this was an inside</text>
  <text start="754.75" dur="5.58">job and we&amp;#39;ll have to see where this</text>
  <text start="757.63" dur="6">goes from here because this is very odd</text>
  <text start="760.33" dur="5.76">now what&amp;#39;s even stranger is remember we</text>
  <text start="763.63" dur="3.93">talked about the alpha bank and how they</text>
  <text start="766.09" dur="4.05">made a really big deal that Trump is</text>
  <text start="767.56" dur="4.77">communicating with Russia and he has</text>
  <text start="770.14" dur="3.96">connections and it turned out that this</text>
  <text start="772.33" dur="5.85">was completely fake phony in false it</text>
  <text start="774.1" dur="5.76">was a server that was compromised spam</text>
  <text start="778.18" dur="4.8">was going all out all over the places</text>
  <text start="779.86" dur="5.37">well very interestingly the Russian bank</text>
  <text start="782.98" dur="3.8">alpha bank just reported to us</text>
  <text start="785.23" dur="4.86">authorities that the mysterious</text>
  <text start="786.78" dur="6.64">communications has recently resumed</text>
  <text start="790.09" dur="6.15">between the two computers one that Trump</text>
  <text start="793.42" dur="5.37">has in his business not personally but</text>
  <text start="796.24" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s in one of his businesses and their</text>
  <text start="798.79" dur="6.51">computer their server in Russia and</text>
  <text start="801.91" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re saying that activity has begun</text>
  <text start="805.3" dur="4.47">again and there&amp;#39;s information going back</text>
  <text start="806.8" dur="5.27">and forth and they looked closely at it</text>
  <text start="809.77" dur="5.28">and they&amp;#39;re saying that the activity</text>
  <text start="812.07" dur="6.67">maybe work of a hacker trying to create</text>
  <text start="815.05" dur="5.85">a political hoax or they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="818.74" dur="5.46">make it look like Trump is again</text>
  <text start="820.9" dur="6.24">communicating with Russia because how</text>
  <text start="824.2" dur="6">interestingly as the Russian propaganda</text>
  <text start="827.14" dur="4.74">of Trump being connected to Russia well</text>
  <text start="830.2" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s completely falling apart there is</text>
  <text start="831.88" dur="5.22">no evidence whatsoever I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="834.43" dur="6">surprised at this point where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="837.1" dur="5.82">trying to create something so Russia</text>
  <text start="840.43" dur="4.68">right away went to the Department of</text>
  <text start="842.92" dur="3.84">Justice said this is happening just to</text>
  <text start="845.11" dur="3.6">let you know you need to start an</text>
  <text start="846.76" dur="4.2">investigation and find out where exactly</text>
  <text start="848.71" dur="4.94">it&amp;#39;s coming from now</text>
  <text start="850.96" dur="5.22">communication attempted to trigger</text>
  <text start="853.65" dur="5.95">varick verification signals between</text>
  <text start="856.18" dur="5.76">alpha bank and a server associated with</text>
  <text start="859.6" dur="4.65">Trump&amp;#39;s organization the source said the</text>
  <text start="861.94" dur="4.38">spoofing attempt to is equivalent to</text>
  <text start="864.25" dur="4.38">someone in the u.s. sending an empty</text>
  <text start="866.32" dur="3.81">envelope to the Trump Tower but putting</text>
  <text start="868.63" dur="4.53">on the envelope a return address in</text>
  <text start="870.13" dur="5.28">Russia causing the Trump server to false</text>
  <text start="873.16" dur="5.01">return the communication back to Moscow</text>
  <text start="875.41" dur="5.16">so someone definitely knows what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="878.17" dur="4.83">doing and they&amp;#39;re trying to make it look</text>
  <text start="880.57" dur="5.22">like that these two servers are</text>
  <text start="883" dur="5.22">communicating and messages are going</text>
  <text start="885.79" dur="4.29">back and forth so we&amp;#39;ll have to watch</text>
  <text start="888.22" dur="4.89">that very carefully and see what comes</text>
  <text start="890.08" dur="6.05">out of this now we know that the</text>
  <text start="893.11" dur="7.05">Department of Justice they indicted two</text>
  <text start="896.13" dur="5.35">spies in Russia despise do not live in</text>
  <text start="900.16" dur="3.54">the United States they live in Russia</text>
  <text start="901.48" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s no extradition treaty between</text>
  <text start="903.7" dur="3.99">Russia and the United States so</text>
  <text start="905.44" dur="3.87">nothing&amp;#39;s going to happen Russia has</text>
  <text start="907.69" dur="4.92">just come out and said they have</text>
  <text start="909.31" dur="6.84">received absolutely nothing from the</text>
  <text start="912.61" dur="6.51">United States in respect to this whole</text>
  <text start="916.15" dur="4.77">hacking of Yahoo so so far nothing has</text>
  <text start="919.12" dur="4.02">happened they haven&amp;#39;t received any type</text>
  <text start="920.92" dur="5.01">of message whatsoever now we know the</text>
  <text start="923.14" dur="5.4">Dutch vote that has ended and we know</text>
  <text start="925.93" dur="5.7">that Guertin Wilder didn&amp;#39;t win but</text>
  <text start="928.54" dur="6.93">something very interesting did happen we</text>
  <text start="931.63" dur="6.39">know that mark wrote a he is a globalist</text>
  <text start="935.47" dur="6.21">he&amp;#39;s not going to split apart from the E</text>
  <text start="938.02" dur="5.73">but right before the elections to</text>
  <text start="941.68" dur="4.11">publicly funded websites used by Dutch</text>
  <text start="943.75" dur="4.23">voters to help them decide which party</text>
  <text start="945.79" dur="5.07">to vote for and the national election</text>
  <text start="947.98" dur="5.19">were inaccessible days before the</text>
  <text start="950.86" dur="4.65">election now most voters use them in</text>
  <text start="953.17" dur="5.64">weeks ahead of voting not on Election</text>
  <text start="955.51" dur="5.16">Day but they use it because they try to</text>
  <text start="958.81" dur="4.35">figure out who is the best candidate to</text>
  <text start="960.67" dur="4.38">vote for there&amp;#39;s like 30 questions on</text>
  <text start="963.16" dur="3.66">there and if they answer the questions</text>
  <text start="965.05" dur="3.93">that gives them some idea of who they</text>
  <text start="966.82" dur="4.92">should vote for and during this period</text>
  <text start="968.98" dur="5.61">right before the election the servers</text>
  <text start="971.74" dur="5.16">came under a ddos attack and they were</text>
  <text start="974.59" dur="5.58">inaccessible by everyone which I find</text>
  <text start="976.9" dur="6.12">very interesting because they knew that</text>
  <text start="980.17" dur="4.74">there might be cyber attacks so the</text>
  <text start="983.02" dur="3.54">Dutch government decided that all</text>
  <text start="984.91" dur="4.41">votes in the election would be hand</text>
  <text start="986.56" dur="4.83">counted after their intelligence agency</text>
  <text start="989.32" dur="3.63">warned of foreign governments that could</text>
  <text start="991.39" dur="5.19">attempt to influence the elections by</text>
  <text start="992.95" dur="5.58">hacking the computer system so just very</text>
  <text start="996.58" dur="4.29">interesting how the people didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="998.53" dur="4.02">access to these computers they were</text>
  <text start="1000.87" dur="4.56">going to do hand counts which they did</text>
  <text start="1002.55" dur="5.04">but people wanted questions answered to</text>
  <text start="1005.43" dur="3.42">see who is the best candidate and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1007.59" dur="3.45">just very interesting that it happened</text>
  <text start="1008.85" dur="4.65">at the exact the exact same time the</text>
  <text start="1011.04" dur="5.18">election going on now out in North Korea</text>
  <text start="1013.5" dur="6.6">we see things are really building up and</text>
  <text start="1016.22" dur="7.21">we are one poked away from a complete</text>
  <text start="1020.1" dur="6.33">disaster world war three right now the</text>
  <text start="1023.43" dur="5.85">Swift messaging system well they&amp;#39;ve cut</text>
  <text start="1026.43" dur="5.37">off all remaining banks in North Korea</text>
  <text start="1029.28" dur="5.1">and this is where money is transferred</text>
  <text start="1031.8" dur="5.73">around the world and right now North</text>
  <text start="1034.38" dur="6.72">Korea has been cut off we see Tillerson</text>
  <text start="1037.53" dur="5.7">is out there warning that the United</text>
  <text start="1041.1" dur="4.98">States patients with North Korea well it</text>
  <text start="1043.23" dur="5.91">is ended and like we said yesterday in</text>
  <text start="1046.08" dur="5.28">the report the foreign policy it looks</text>
  <text start="1049.14" dur="4.86">like the deep state has control over it</text>
  <text start="1051.36" dur="4.92">and they knew that they couldn&amp;#39;t start</text>
  <text start="1054" dur="4.17">anything with Russia which Trump it just</text>
  <text start="1056.28" dur="3.81">wasn&amp;#39;t a possibility so they look for</text>
  <text start="1058.17" dur="4.08">other hot buttons and they saw like oh</text>
  <text start="1060.09" dur="4.77">he gets really angry and upset with</text>
  <text start="1062.25" dur="4.2">North Korea and Iran and ever since that</text>
  <text start="1064.86" dur="4.68">point in time and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking</text>
  <text start="1066.45" dur="6.69">this they&amp;#39;ve been pushing North Korea to</text>
  <text start="1069.54" dur="5.88">get them all heated up and we can see</text>
  <text start="1073.14" dur="3.84">they are definitely doing it and we see</text>
  <text start="1075.42" dur="4.26">a Russian senator is out there saying</text>
  <text start="1076.98" dur="4.5">the US their withdrawal from the talks</text>

  <text start="1144.72" dur="6.49">April okay the United States South Korea</text>

  <text start="1157.66" dur="4.35">and they&amp;#39;re saying North Korea is going</text>
  <text start="1159.79" dur="5.34">to do something this makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1162.01" dur="6.48">whatsoever it&amp;#39;s almost like saying that</text>
  <text start="1165.13" dur="6.36">Russia is going to invade Ukraine Russia</text>
  <text start="1168.49" dur="5.4">is going to invade the Baltic States how</text>
  <text start="1171.49" dur="6.36">possibly can this be true does everyone</text>
  <text start="1173.89" dur="6.33">realize that Putin has cut his military</text>
  <text start="1177.85" dur="4.08">spending when you look at the figures</text>
  <text start="1180.22" dur="3.9">from the russian federal treasury</text>
  <text start="1181.93" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ve confirmed that russia&amp;#39;s defense</text>
  <text start="1184.12" dur="5.52">budget has been cut by twenty five point</text>
  <text start="1186.22" dur="5.52">five percent for 2017 does this sound</text>
  <text start="1189.64" dur="5.67">like a country that is ramping up for</text>
  <text start="1191.74" dur="6.12">war no actually who&amp;#39;s trying to increase</text>
  <text start="1195.31" dur="5.64">the military budget oh the United States</text>
  <text start="1197.86" dur="5.7">so we can see at this point a lot of</text>
  <text start="1200.95" dur="4.59">this stuff is propaganda the United</text>
  <text start="1203.56" dur="4.56">States Trump they need to sit down with</text>
  <text start="1205.54" dur="4.92">North Korea before we move this to the</text>
  <text start="1208.12" dur="5.46">next level and the next level will be</text>
  <text start="1210.46" dur="5.97">war because we know we have certain</text>
  <text start="1213.58" dur="6.45">forces training to take out Kim jong-un</text>

  <text start="1222.4" dur="4.56">the hall poking that kid I&amp;#39;ve said it</text>
  <text start="1224.35" dur="5.7">many many times and this could happen in</text>

  <text start="1237.46" dur="2.91">they been testing this to see if they</text>
  <text start="1238.9" dur="4.08">can gain control of their missiles</text>
