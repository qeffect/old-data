  <text start="44.11" dur="3.99">was kind of messed up and a couple</text>
  <text start="45.64" dur="4.02">people told me about it and I went on to</text>
  <text start="48.1" dur="4.61">different browser like Safari Internet</text>
  <text start="49.66" dur="6.36">Explorer Firefox and I realized that</text>
  <text start="52.71" dur="5.919">something was wrong and it looks like it</text>
  <text start="56.02" dur="4.35">turned out to be the caching so the site</text>
  <text start="58.629" dur="3.93">was not hacked it looks like something</text>
  <text start="60.37" dur="5.7">just got messed up deleted everything</text>
  <text start="62.559" dur="6.721">and we created the cache and it looks</text>
  <text start="66.07" dur="4.409">like the site is running okay now and I</text>
  <text start="69.28" dur="4.62">just want to thank those people that</text>
  <text start="70.479" dur="5.581">emailed me and let me know because I on</text>
  <text start="73.9" dur="6.27">the browser I was using it was fine so I</text>
  <text start="76.06" dur="6.75">don&amp;#39;t know if that was you know that was</text>
  <text start="80.17" dur="4.62">stuck in the browser that way or I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="82.81" dur="4.26">know what happened there but it&amp;#39;s fixed</text>
  <text start="84.79" dur="5.759">now so everything seems to be working</text>
  <text start="87.07" dur="8.869">now let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="90.549" dur="9.39">news and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the market</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="5.741">closed down today gold is up and of</text>
  <text start="99.939" dur="3.72">course if the market closes down they</text>
  <text start="101.68" dur="5.07">blame it on earnings of different</text>
  <text start="103.659" dur="4.32">companies and oh and the weather they</text>
  <text start="106.75" dur="3.17">always blame everything on the weather</text>
  <text start="107.979" dur="4.53">which is mean cookie dough cokes</text>
  <text start="109.92" dur="6.1">revenue earnings are down to whether</text>
  <text start="112.509" dur="5.04">Yahoo the earnings are down so it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="116.02" dur="3.599">revenue it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="117.549" dur="4.11">weather and that&amp;#39;s what they always come</text>
  <text start="119.619" dur="5.93">up with and that&amp;#39;s what they always use</text>
  <text start="121.659" dur="7.14">when when things aren&amp;#39;t going right so</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="8.83">but besides that let&amp;#39;s see what else is</text>
  <text start="128.799" dur="9.181">going on now in Europe car sales are not</text>
  <text start="134.379" dur="5.151">doing that well and car sales a double</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="7.22">dip and they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="139.53" dur="8.82">really moving along slowly compared to</text>
  <text start="145.2" dur="5.55">the US auto automobile manufacturer and</text>
  <text start="148.35" dur="4.95">I believe the automobile manufacturers</text>
  <text start="150.75" dur="4.62">in the US are getting a little bit of</text>
  <text start="153.3" dur="6.06">help and they&amp;#39;re starting to use the</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="7.11">same tactics they used way back where</text>
  <text start="159.36" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re giving you special deals on the</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="5.34">loans and this is how they got into</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="5.1">trouble before but they&amp;#39;re showing that</text>
  <text start="167.82" dur="6.15">car sales are doing ok in America and</text>
  <text start="170.61" dur="5.52">the European car manufacturer is not and</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="4.29">this went on to say the European car</text>
  <text start="176.13" dur="4.05">sales the last two months have been a</text>
  <text start="178.26" dur="4.74">bitter disappointment as sales have</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="11.25">collapsed once again down six point</text>
  <text start="183" dur="9.6">three percent and as we move on here</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="3.84">let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="192.6" dur="4.79">goodbye full-time jobs hello part-time</text>
  <text start="195.27" dur="5.31">jobs rest in peace middle-class and</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="6.4">really what is going on here everything</text>
  <text start="200.58" dur="6.74">all the full time jobs everyone was</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="6.18">getting prepared for Obamacare they were</text>
  <text start="207.32" dur="5.35">removing full-time people making them</text>
  <text start="209.97" dur="4.38">part-time cutting back on hours people</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="6.45">who are getting laid off in positions</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="6.72">that were being removed they were not</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="4.85">being replaced by anyone so those people</text>
  <text start="221.07" dur="4.889">had to go out and buy and and find</text>
  <text start="223.97" dur="4.92">part-time work because it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="225.959" dur="7.53">difficult to find full-time work and</text>
  <text start="228.89" dur="8.409">many people are receiving or get or</text>
  <text start="233.489" dur="6.511">getting one the two jobs to make up for</text>
  <text start="237.299" dur="5.101">the one full-time job and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="240" dur="6.56">this happen all over the place and of</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="9.42">course Obamacare doesn&amp;#39;t help because</text>
  <text start="246.56" dur="7.899">Obamacare is is a basically a penalty on</text>
  <text start="251.82" dur="4.83">business businesses and the people I</text>
  <text start="254.459" dur="4.681">mean if you really think about it all</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="6.84">businesses are getting prepared because</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="6.99">they thought in 2014 it was going to</text>
  <text start="263.49" dur="4.62">take effect and all businesses are</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="3.99">starting to get prepared for it but the</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="3.98">government has pushed it off until 2015</text>
  <text start="270.12" dur="5.39">because they realized that</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="7.29">this would really wreak havoc on the</text>
  <text start="275.51" dur="5.82">economy and the job situation and I</text>
  <text start="279.38" dur="3.539">don&amp;#39;t think they can change the</text>
  <text start="281.33" dur="5.16">calculation any more than they already</text>
  <text start="282.919" dur="6.271">have unless they just you know stop</text>
  <text start="286.49" dur="4.47">counting everybody and just say the</text>
  <text start="289.19" dur="4.259">unemployment rate is just good I mean</text>
  <text start="290.96" dur="7.34">it&amp;#39;s just you know what else can they do</text>
  <text start="293.449" dur="8.041">here but Obamacare is definitely a</text>
  <text start="298.3" dur="8.679">penalty on the people and I&amp;#39;ve gone over</text>
  <text start="301.49" dur="9.239">this before and those people who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="306.979" dur="6.211">take Obamacare you will be taxed so</text>
  <text start="310.729" dur="6.5">you&amp;#39;re penalized for not taking you know</text>
  <text start="313.19" dur="8.61">this great incredible health care system</text>
  <text start="317.229" dur="6.94">so you will be penalized businesses if</text>
  <text start="321.8" dur="4.53">they have full-time employees or</text>
  <text start="324.169" dur="4.591">part-time employees that are over a</text>
  <text start="326.33" dur="5.64">certain number of hours and they do not</text>
  <text start="328.76" dur="5.879">give them the health insurance they are</text>
  <text start="331.97" dur="5.34">also penalized and again I&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="334.639" dur="5.191">before if you are giving something to</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="7.229">the people and it&amp;#39;s good for the people</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="7.62">there is no reason for penalties to me</text>
  <text start="344.539" dur="5.041">this whole thing with Obamacare looks</text>
  <text start="347.45" dur="6.589">like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it was designed to help</text>
  <text start="349.58" dur="6.38">the health insurance to get rid of</text>
  <text start="354.039" dur="4.481">competition because now it&amp;#39;s mandatory</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="6.66">so now they can set the rates to</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="9">whatever they want and to drive in</text>
  <text start="362.62" dur="8.29">income tax or taxes to help with the</text>
  <text start="367.52" dur="5.82">payment of the national debt and what</text>
  <text start="370.91" dur="4.8">you know to raise revenue for the</text>
  <text start="373.34" dur="6.299">government otherwise I don&amp;#39;t see any</text>
  <text start="375.71" dur="7.47">other benefits for this thing now there</text>
  <text start="379.639" dur="6.331">was a very interesting article that had</text>
  <text start="383.18" dur="6.03">to do with KKR suspends first date of</text>
  <text start="385.97" dur="6.12">401 K replaces cash bonuses with stocks</text>
  <text start="389.21" dur="6.78">and a long time ago I work for a bank</text>
  <text start="392.09" dur="6.449">and they did this they did the same type</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="5.25">of thing where people used to get</text>
  <text start="398.539" dur="6.481">bonuses they took half of what your so</text>
  <text start="401.24" dur="4.68">let&amp;#39;s say your bonus was $10,000 they</text>
  <text start="405.02" dur="2.94">would take</text>
  <text start="405.92" dur="4.59">half of your bonus and give you company</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="6.6">stock and the other half you would get</text>
  <text start="410.51" dur="7.98">in cash and this is going to spread to</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="6.12">all companies and this is how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.49" dur="4.74">going to get away with paying people</text>
  <text start="420.68" dur="6.03">less because no we paid you but we just</text>
  <text start="423.23" dur="6.36">paid you in stock of the company and</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="5.55">what happens is and I know and I read</text>
  <text start="429.59" dur="15.24">this article and I didn&amp;#39;t see any type</text>
  <text start="432.26" dur="15.08">of you know details about how this works</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="6.6">because I know when I work for a bank to</text>
  <text start="447.34" dur="9.7">receive that stock you had to work there</text>
  <text start="451.43" dur="9.87">for five years to get that stock if you</text>
  <text start="457.04" dur="8.97">left on your own beforehand you received</text>
  <text start="461.3" dur="7.68">nothing so it is very different than</text>
  <text start="466.01" dur="4.89">receiving a cash bonus because if you</text>
  <text start="468.98" dur="5.55">receive the ten thousand cash bonus you</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="6.27">get I mean - taxes you get the full ten</text>
  <text start="474.53" dur="5.22">thousand dollars for but for those</text>
  <text start="477.17" dur="5.01">people they&amp;#39;re only getting five now</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="4.05">their incomes lower which means less</text>
  <text start="482.18" dur="3.06">disposable income because a lot of</text>
  <text start="483.8" dur="6.42">people might be counting on these</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="8.04">bonuses and now they are getting less</text>
  <text start="490.22" dur="6.09">which means they have to cut back on</text>
  <text start="493.28" dur="5.25">certain things and that stock who knows</text>
  <text start="496.31" dur="6.18">what that&amp;#39;s going to be worth in the end</text>
  <text start="498.53" dur="9.33">and we can see this where this could be</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="9.8">a template of where this could spread to</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="8.7">other companies which I think it will</text>
  <text start="512.29" dur="7">okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now premiums</text>
  <text start="516.56" dur="5.91">high in China and India and China gold</text>
  <text start="519.29" dur="5.37">deliveries double and this goes on to</text>
  <text start="522.47" dur="6.54">say gold premiums in China remain high</text>
  <text start="524.66" dur="5.7">at nearly $30 per ounce an indication of</text>
  <text start="529.01" dur="3.81">strong demand and the People&amp;#39;s Republic</text>
  <text start="530.36" dur="5.55">of China and premiums in India remain</text>
  <text start="532.82" dur="5.4">robust Chinese gold demand remains</text>
  <text start="535.91" dur="3.27">insatiable with record deliveries being</text>
  <text start="538.22" dur="3.6">seen on the show</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="5.43">hi gold exchange physical gold delivered</text>
  <text start="541.82" dur="5.58">to buyers by China&amp;#39;s largest billion in</text>
  <text start="544.61" dur="5.25">the first half this year almost matched</text>
  <text start="547.4" dur="6.12">the entire amount taken from the vault</text>
  <text start="549.86" dur="9.5">in all of 2012 so we can see that people</text>
  <text start="553.52" dur="10.14">are rushing into physical gold and in</text>
  <text start="559.36" dur="7.72">Vietnam and it&amp;#39;s funny when I read this</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="6.57">article and I thought about places like</text>
  <text start="567.08" dur="6.33">here in America in the UK and Australia</text>
  <text start="570.23" dur="5.85">and it&amp;#39;s probably all the same in in the</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="7.17">European nations also where we were</text>
  <text start="576.08" dur="9.18">brought up and kind of brainwashed to</text>
  <text start="580.58" dur="7.62">think that paper money was the real deal</text>
  <text start="585.26" dur="5.97">I mean you hear this the saying cash is</text>
  <text start="588.2" dur="5.91">king and we were brought up to think</text>
  <text start="591.23" dur="7.23">that having this piece of paper meant</text>
  <text start="594.11" dur="8.04">that you had actual money but in other</text>
  <text start="598.46" dur="7.38">countries it is very interesting the way</text>
  <text start="602.15" dur="7.86">they think let&amp;#39;s for example in this</text>
  <text start="605.84" dur="7.59">articles and it&amp;#39;s been my habit for ages</text>
  <text start="610.01" dur="7.83">buying gold whenever I can save up some</text>
  <text start="613.43" dur="7.35">money said Wang who is 57 with gold I</text>
  <text start="617.84" dur="5.31">can save my fortune and later on have</text>
  <text start="620.78" dur="5.4">something valuable to pass down to my</text>
  <text start="623.15" dur="5.76">children and grandchildren so they</text>
  <text start="626.18" dur="5.91">believe that gold and precious metals</text>
  <text start="628.91" dur="5.67">let&amp;#39;s just say are their real money and</text>
  <text start="632.09" dur="6">something of value and then I started to</text>
  <text start="634.58" dur="6">think in 1920 you know 25 28 whenever</text>
  <text start="638.09" dur="7.85">during that time period when gold was</text>
  <text start="640.58" dur="11.7">$20 an ounce if I gave each one of you</text>
  <text start="645.94" dur="9.31">$20 in your left hand and one ounce of</text>
  <text start="652.28" dur="5.03">gold in your right hand and you save</text>
  <text start="655.25" dur="8.16">that until right now</text>
  <text start="657.31" dur="8.95">which has real worth well the $20 that</text>
  <text start="663.41" dur="5.85">has lost what like 96% of its value and</text>
  <text start="666.26" dur="6.4">the ounce of gold today is approaching</text>
  <text start="669.26" dur="6.939">1300 which would you rather have</text>
  <text start="672.66" dur="8.34">I know which one I would definitely the</text>
  <text start="676.199" dur="7.101">gold so I it&amp;#39;s amazing how we were</text>
  <text start="681" dur="5.519">brought up to think gold is just</text>
  <text start="683.3" dur="4.899">something that you wear or you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.519" dur="5.731">for earrings it&amp;#39;s for rings it&amp;#39;s for</text>
  <text start="688.199" dur="6.091">necklaces and these pieces of paper are</text>
  <text start="692.25" dur="5.37">the real money and what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="694.29" dur="5.549">happen just like the people in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="697.62" dur="7.339">I&amp;#39;ve seen and the people in Greece have</text>
  <text start="699.839" dur="10.261">seen when banks go on a holiday or</text>
  <text start="704.959" dur="8.25">ballons happen they can take or freeze</text>
  <text start="710.1" dur="7.429">your accounts of this paper money and</text>
  <text start="713.209" dur="7.721">what do you have you have nothing and</text>
  <text start="717.529" dur="5.521">even if you had the paper money in your</text>
  <text start="720.93" dur="8.279">home or under your mattress</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="10.089">when hyperinflation hits and your dollar</text>
  <text start="729.209" dur="9.57">is worth nothing just like they saw in</text>
  <text start="733.139" dur="8.7">Germany then what and if we go back in</text>
  <text start="738.779" dur="6.511">time how many different paper currencies</text>
  <text start="741.839" dur="5.49">were there over you know in Timon</text>
  <text start="745.29" dur="5.94">I mean if when we look at America and it</text>
  <text start="747.329" dur="6.601">was the colonies were were here they use</text>
  <text start="751.23" dur="6.15">something called script is script worth</text>
  <text start="753.93" dur="8.31">anything today no it&amp;#39;s worth nothing but</text>
  <text start="757.38" dur="10.62">if you had silver or gold that is worth</text>
  <text start="762.24" dur="9.029">something now talking about gold and</text>
  <text start="768" dur="5.639">precious metals Brinks vaults are being</text>
  <text start="771.269" dur="7.05">depleted this has the appearance of a</text>
  <text start="773.639" dur="7.5">bank run on the banks and what as what</text>
  <text start="778.319" dur="4.861">we see here in this article it says they</text>
  <text start="781.139" dur="3.93">have gone from four hundred and forty</text>
  <text start="783.18" dur="4.29">seven thousand one hundred ninety nine</text>
  <text start="785.069" dur="4.2">on July third to a hundred and thirty</text>
  <text start="787.47" dur="5.58">four thousand five hundred twenty-five</text>
  <text start="789.269" dur="6.12">on July 9th which is a drop of three</text>
  <text start="793.05" dur="7.589">hundred and twelve six hundred and</text>
  <text start="795.389" dur="8.7">seventy four thousand ounces and if this</text>
  <text start="800.639" dur="5.911">is correct then this is a decline of 70%</text>

  <text start="908.459" dur="5.911">are getting better and they are going to</text>
  <text start="910.92" dur="7.68">be sadly disappointed when everything</text>
  <text start="914.37" dur="6.959">comes tumbling down now there was a</text>
  <text start="918.6" dur="5.88">report that inflation came in just as</text>
  <text start="921.329" dur="5.401">expected at 0.2 percent but of course</text>
  <text start="924.48" dur="5.16">you know the inflation calculation has</text>
  <text start="926.73" dur="8.609">been changed and if you don&amp;#39;t include</text>
  <text start="929.64" dur="9.31">energy you don&amp;#39;t include food yes then</text>
  <text start="935.339" dur="7.241">and if there is no inflation</text>
  <text start="938.95" dur="7.71">but if you include food and you include</text>
  <text start="942.58" dur="6.06">energy and inflation is on the rise I</text>
  <text start="946.66" dur="5.37">went over this yesterday in the episode</text>
  <text start="948.64" dur="5.07">the percentage of all of different</text>
  <text start="952.03" dur="4.14">products and you can just see for</text>
  <text start="953.71" dur="6.21">yourself I do have a page called</text>
  <text start="956.17" dur="7.02">inflation deflation and that shows that</text>
  <text start="959.92" dur="5.19">prices are starting to rise again and we</text>
  <text start="963.19" dur="5.07">first for some reason I always see it</text>
  <text start="965.11" dur="5.37">rise in milk first fuel and then I see</text>
  <text start="968.26" dur="5.42">milk and then it spreads down to all</text>
  <text start="970.48" dur="6.06">other type of crude food products and</text>
  <text start="973.68" dur="6.28">actually I like I said yesterday I see</text>
  <text start="976.54" dur="7.98">it in wine right now especially moving</text>
  <text start="979.96" dur="9.12">up but just from fuel alone I mean think</text>
  <text start="984.52" dur="7.97">about think back to 1995 or 1999 when</text>
  <text start="989.08" dur="6.48">fuel was like around 99 cents or so and</text>
  <text start="992.49" dur="5.65">now today it&amp;#39;s approaching four dollars</text>
  <text start="995.56" dur="4.62">some places five dollars so you can</text>
  <text start="998.14" dur="3.96">definitely see the inflation and if you</text>
  <text start="1000.18" dur="6.03">go back with food like a gallon of milk</text>
  <text start="1002.1" dur="6.6">as around 385 if you go back in time you</text>
  <text start="1006.21" dur="5.79">were looking at milk at 99 cents so</text>
  <text start="1008.7" dur="6.21">there is there is definitely inflation</text>
  <text start="1012" dur="8.91">so basically you need more of this paper</text>
  <text start="1014.91" dur="8.25">money to buy the same exact products now</text>
  <text start="1020.91" dur="4.71">I know we discussed Obamacare and the</text>
  <text start="1023.16" dur="5.19">job situation but there was a survey</text>
  <text start="1025.62" dur="5.55">that came out that said 74 74 percent of</text>
  <text start="1028.35" dur="5.88">small businesses will fire workers and</text>
  <text start="1031.17" dur="5.55">cut hours under Obamacare and they are</text>
  <text start="1034.23" dur="5.219">definitely getting prepared and getting</text>
  <text start="1036.72" dur="4.109">ready for Obamacare and this is why this</text>
  <text start="1039.449" dur="4.351">is taking place even though the</text>
  <text start="1040.829" dur="6.781">government and you know the president</text>
  <text start="1043.8" dur="6.27">decided that they&amp;#39;re going to just put</text>
  <text start="1047.61" dur="4.77">that part of Obamacare off which is</text>
  <text start="1050.07" dur="4.53">which he is really not allowed to do</text>
  <text start="1052.38" dur="4.8">under the Constitution he&amp;#39;s not allowed</text>
  <text start="1054.6" dur="4.71">after the law has the bill has been</text>
  <text start="1057.18" dur="3.72">passed and put into law he can&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="1059.31" dur="4.2">pick and choose which part of it he</text>
  <text start="1060.9" dur="4.71">wants to enact and which parts he</text>
  <text start="1063.51" dur="5.4">doesn&amp;#39;t want to end delay it&amp;#39;s not up to</text>
  <text start="1065.61" dur="5.61">him but the survey goes on to say that</text>
  <text start="1068.91" dur="3.87">77 percent continue to think the US</text>
  <text start="1071.22" dur="4.02">economy is in</text>
  <text start="1072.78" dur="4.89">is on the wrong track and eighty-three</text>

  <text start="1081.51" dur="4.65">ability of the immigration system is</text>
  <text start="1082.95" dur="5.04">completely broken which I do believe the</text>
  <text start="1086.16" dur="3.33">immigration system is completely broken</text>
  <text start="1087.99" dur="3.87">especially what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1089.49" dur="5.85">where they&amp;#39;re trying to pass the bill</text>
  <text start="1091.86" dur="7.08">and allow all these immigrants get work</text>
  <text start="1095.34" dur="8.04">and they are not covered under the</text>
  <text start="1098.94" dur="6.6">Obamacare and this this is complete even</text>
  <text start="1103.38" dur="3.54">though it was voted down I&amp;#39;m sure this</text>
  <text start="1105.54" dur="6.84">will be brought up again</text>
  <text start="1106.92" dur="8.58">and tried to be passed okay let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="1112.38" dur="7.44">on here now Japan scrambles fighter jets</text>
  <text start="1115.5" dur="6.24">to track Russian bombers and there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1142.74" dur="2.97">are they&amp;#39;re trying to make it like</text>
  <text start="1144.27" dur="3.21">things are getting out of hand and they</text>
  <text start="1145.71" dur="5.58">had a scramble that the fighter is</text>
  <text start="1147.48" dur="9.12">because Russia came too close and I mean</text>
  <text start="1151.29" dur="10.23">really come on now Japanese they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1156.6" dur="7.56">moving to nationalize islands where</text>
  <text start="1161.52" dur="6.27">China and Japan really have no claim on</text>

  <text start="1170.7" dur="4.41">bolster its territorial claims in a move</text>
  <text start="1173.31" dur="3.69">that could complicate already simmering</text>

  <text start="1184.08" dur="5.82">somehow and by Japan going out saying</text>
  <text start="1186.57" dur="6">that these are our Islands now this will</text>

  <text start="1525.94" dur="4.17">are starting to use facial recognition</text>
  <text start="1527.26" dur="5.79">software to arrest suspects and again</text>
  <text start="1530.11" dur="8.88">this is against your Fourth Amendment</text>
  <text start="1533.05" dur="9.33">right and they are using this and to</text>
  <text start="1538.99" dur="6.54">track each individual and you can see</text>
  <text start="1542.38" dur="6.95">how this can get out of hand where they</text>
  <text start="1545.53" dur="6.9">can now put your face and a name of</text>
  <text start="1549.33" dur="6.13">where you&amp;#39;ve been who you met who are</text>
  <text start="1552.43" dur="5.64">the people you met with all day long</text>
  <text start="1555.46" dur="4.77">what restaurant you went into who was in</text>
  <text start="1558.07" dur="3.84">that restaurant oh this person went in</text>
  <text start="1560.23" dur="3.54">there I was wondering if they met with</text>
  <text start="1561.91" dur="5.48">this person and this person has criminal</text>
  <text start="1563.77" dur="6.83">activities or this is a complete</text>
  <text start="1567.39" dur="6.04">surveillance state at this point and</text>
  <text start="1570.6" dur="4.15">this is against your constitutional</text>
  <text start="1573.43" dur="3.27">right you should not be able to be</text>
  <text start="1574.75" dur="10.41">followed these records should not be</text>
  <text start="1576.7" dur="10.8">able to be kept and this is system which</text>
  <text start="1585.16" dur="5.79">I believe they want to spread which is</text>
  <text start="1587.5" dur="7.17">spreading across America is to keep tabs</text>
  <text start="1590.95" dur="7.05">on each person and not just to keep tabs</text>
  <text start="1594.67" dur="6.69">with cameras but to understand who each</text>
  <text start="1598" dur="8.04">person is who each person is meeting</text>
  <text start="1601.36" dur="10.22">with and this is a very serious</text>
  <text start="1606.04" dur="7.71">situation okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now</text>
  <text start="1611.58" dur="5.23">now there was a very interesting article</text>
  <text start="1613.75" dur="8.28">said forget prism fair few is the NSA</text>
  <text start="1616.81" dur="8.64">project to own the Internet now there is</text>
  <text start="1622.03" dur="9.87">something called a fair few and Blarney</text>
  <text start="1625.45" dur="8.94">and this is upstream technology upstream</text>
  <text start="1631.9" dur="5.16">means you get inside the system before</text>
  <text start="1634.39" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s in the internet and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1637.06" dur="6.84">they want to tap in to the fiber-optic</text>
  <text start="1640.57" dur="9.09">cables before and collect the data at</text>
  <text start="1643.9" dur="9.36">that point and this person Drake refers</text>
  <text start="1649.66" dur="7.28">to as a highly classified program for</text>
  <text start="1653.26" dur="8.13">tapping into the world intercontinental</text>
  <text start="1656.94" dur="7.66">fiber-optic cables and this is the</text>
  <text start="1661.39" dur="8.85">highest level means to own the Internet</text>
  <text start="1664.6" dur="7.94">and what they will do once the NSA</text>
  <text start="1670.24" dur="6.15">receives the information is collected it</text>
  <text start="1672.54" dur="7.36">will transmit the data back to the</text>
  <text start="1676.39" dur="7.56">agency to be analyzed by the data mining</text>
  <text start="1679.9" dur="7.11">programs so what they&amp;#39;re saying is they</text>
  <text start="1683.95" dur="7.55">won&amp;#39;t need backdoors they will have a</text>
  <text start="1687.01" dur="10.74">way to get everyone&amp;#39;s information</text>
  <text start="1691.5" dur="9.01">without asking companies and again this</text>
  <text start="1697.75" dur="5.75">is a surveillance state this is against</text>
  <text start="1700.51" dur="5.94">your Fourth Amendment right and these</text>
  <text start="1703.5" dur="5.2">government officials should be brought</text>
  <text start="1706.45" dur="6.24">up on charges because all of this</text>
  <text start="1708.7" dur="7.17">information does not work if it does</text>
  <text start="1712.69" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;d be catching criminals if it does</text>
  <text start="1715.87" dur="7.16">they would have caught every single</text>
  <text start="1718.15" dur="4.88">terrorist that was out there if it does</text>
  <text start="1724.17" dur="7.03">we would have really like no crime</text>
  <text start="1728.86" dur="5.28">because they would know what is going on</text>
  <text start="1731.2" dur="6.18">but they&amp;#39;re not using it for that they</text>
  <text start="1734.14" dur="5.63">are using it to keep tabs on people to</text>
  <text start="1737.38" dur="5.27">understand where the problems will be</text>
  <text start="1739.77" dur="5.52">when the economic collapse hits they</text>
  <text start="1742.65" dur="4.59">want they are creating lists they are</text>
  <text start="1745.29" dur="4.47">putting people into groups they are</text>
  <text start="1747.24" dur="4.2">wanting to know who talks to who and</text>
  <text start="1749.76" dur="4.41">what groups you belong to if you belong</text>
  <text start="1751.44" dur="5.79">to the NRA if you belong to any type of</text>
  <text start="1754.17" dur="7.05">militia they want to know where everyone</text>
  <text start="1757.23" dur="7.23">is so when the time comes it is much</text>
  <text start="1761.22" dur="7.92">easier to collect those people just like</text>
  <text start="1764.46" dur="9.15">the Germans did in World War two now</text>
  <text start="1769.14" dur="6.66">South Korea is going and saying that</text>
  <text start="1773.61" dur="7.35">North Korea is behind the cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="1775.8" dur="6.629">and they know this because from the IPS</text>
  <text start="1780.96" dur="3.93">that they have collected they are very</text>
  <text start="1782.429" dur="3.781">similar to the other cyberattacks that</text>
  <text start="1784.89" dur="4.02">they receive but I said this before</text>
  <text start="1786.21" dur="5.219">using proxy servers you can bounce</text>
  <text start="1788.91" dur="5.73">cyberattacks off of many many different</text>
  <text start="1791.429" dur="6.901">servers and the only IP address is the</text>
  <text start="1794.64" dur="5.91">last server that you say and let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1798.33" dur="7.65">use an example when the United States</text>
  <text start="1800.55" dur="8.58">government used stuck next to completely</text>
  <text start="1805.98" dur="5.04">hit Iran and damaged the nuclear</text>
  <text start="1809.13" dur="4.53">facility do you think that they just</text>
  <text start="1811.02" dur="4.59">came from the United States to create</text>
  <text start="1813.66" dur="4.019">this cyberattack no they bounced it off</text>
  <text start="1815.61" dur="6.18">many different servers so it wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1817.679" dur="9.151">look like it was coming from the US the</text>
  <text start="1821.79" dur="8.07">same thing is happening here and this is</text>
  <text start="1826.83" dur="6.53">more propaganda for the cyberattack main</text>
  <text start="1829.86" dur="6.24">event which will eventually be coming</text>
  <text start="1833.36" dur="6.64">listen everyone I really appreciate</text>
