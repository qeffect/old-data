  <text start="147.65" dur="4.41">almost time for the central bankers to</text>
  <text start="149.69" dur="4.049">suppress gold once again because once it</text>
  <text start="152.06" dur="3.36">reaches a certain point they like to</text>
  <text start="153.739" dur="4.351">come in and throw a lot of paper</text>
  <text start="155.42" dur="4.89">contracts at it to bring it back down so</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="5.09">no one is the wiser of what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="160.31" dur="5.7">going on here we see Boeing right now</text>
  <text start="163.18" dur="7.21">well they&amp;#39;re going to have three more</text>
  <text start="166.01" dur="6.72">waves of layoffs in 2017 why well</text>
  <text start="170.39" dur="5.879">because orders are collapsing sales</text>
  <text start="172.73" dur="6.21">aren&amp;#39;t very good and things are going</text>
  <text start="176.269" dur="5.011">very very poorly for Boeing orders have</text>
  <text start="178.94" dur="4.74">plunged fifty three percent in</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="4.14">two years order cancellations have</text>

  <text start="185.42" dur="4.74">production is getting cut and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="188" dur="5.13">going to see a lot of well layoffs</text>
  <text start="190.16" dur="6.93">coming to this company and this is not</text>
  <text start="193.13" dur="7.4">the only company we see many companies</text>
  <text start="197.09" dur="6.96">where their sales they&amp;#39;re just not there</text>
  <text start="200.53" dur="6.1">they&amp;#39;re just barely getting by retail</text>
  <text start="204.05" dur="6.21">stores are foreclosing left and right</text>
  <text start="206.63" dur="8.73">laying off thousands of people and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="8.88">continually seeing this why because what</text>
  <text start="215.36" dur="8.67">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is an illusion</text>
  <text start="219.14" dur="8.37">the economy is not doing what the</text>
  <text start="224.03" dur="7.26">central bank&amp;#39;s what Obama is telling us</text>
  <text start="227.51" dur="6.6">it&amp;#39;s really doing now Obama did one more</text>
  <text start="231.29" dur="4.68">thing maybe he&amp;#39;ll do another but for the</text>
  <text start="234.11" dur="5.22">economy to keep this bubble inflated</text>
  <text start="235.97" dur="7.17">he&amp;#39;s done one more thing to keep</text>
  <text start="239.33" dur="7.2">everything going the way he wants before</text>
  <text start="243.14" dur="6.03">he leaves office now we know that the</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="5.34">real estate market has taken a hit we</text>
  <text start="249.17" dur="6.08">understand that they&amp;#39;ve tried everything</text>
  <text start="251.87" dur="5.88">and people are just not purchasing homes</text>
  <text start="255.25" dur="4.239">yes they want you to believe they are in</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="4.71">the 20 cities that case shiller looks at</text>
  <text start="259.489" dur="6.391">but around the country home sales are</text>
  <text start="262.46" dur="4.8">declining prices are falling and they</text>
  <text start="265.88" dur="3.08">tried everything they lowered the</text>
  <text start="267.26" dur="6.42">interest rates to the lowest point ever</text>
  <text start="268.96" dur="8.41">they brought in subprime buyers and he</text>
  <text start="273.68" dur="8.489">decided to do one more thing he decided</text>
  <text start="277.37" dur="10.41">to lower the insurance premiums for</text>
  <text start="282.169" dur="9.211">subprime borrowers now he only has what</text>
  <text start="287.78" dur="8.67">nine days left in office and he decided</text>
  <text start="291.38" dur="7.05">to do this right now so what this means</text>
  <text start="296.45" dur="3.96">is those subprime people that were</text>
  <text start="298.43" dur="4.109">thrown out of the market because the</text>
  <text start="300.41" dur="5.009">insurance premiums were too high they</text>
  <text start="302.539" dur="5.341">lowered it to bring them back in so they</text>
  <text start="305.419" dur="6.661">can get mortgages remember the central</text>
  <text start="307.88" dur="6.02">banks work on debt they need to keep the</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="6.14">bubble inflated</text>
  <text start="313.9" dur="8.07">out we saw this back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="318.22" dur="7.979">eight and it seems that we&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="321.97" dur="5.97">same thing again where we&amp;#39;re open we</text>
  <text start="326.199" dur="5.371">open up the loans to subprime people</text>
  <text start="327.94" dur="5.729">we&amp;#39;re lowering the insurance premiums to</text>
  <text start="331.57" dur="5.73">bring more of these individuals into the</text>
  <text start="333.669" dur="9.991">fold so they can keep this bubble</text>
  <text start="337.3" dur="9.989">inflated and we have to think back when</text>
  <text start="343.66" dur="9">oldest fell apart in 2008 remember the</text>
  <text start="347.289" dur="10.651">FHA required a 1.7 billion taxpayer</text>
  <text start="352.66" dur="7.67">bailout last time around we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="357.94" dur="5.91">see the same thing happen once again</text>
  <text start="360.33" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re going to need a bailout because</text>
  <text start="363.85" dur="5.16">you know when everything starts to fall</text>
  <text start="366.28" dur="4.05">apart most of these individuals and I</text>
  <text start="369.01" dur="3.15">have nothing against these individuals</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="3.959">they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to pay</text>
  <text start="372.16" dur="4.83">their mortgages jobs are going to be</text>
  <text start="374.289" dur="6.421">lost and everything is going to be a</text>
  <text start="376.99" dur="7.41">complete disaster but you can see what</text>
  <text start="380.71" dur="6.989">they&amp;#39;re doing he wants the economy to</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="5.19">thrive a couple of months after he</text>
  <text start="387.699" dur="4.47">leaves they can&amp;#39;t come down a month or</text>
  <text start="389.59" dur="5.04">two after he leaves very suspicious if</text>
  <text start="392.169" dur="6.211">that happens but if six months eight</text>
  <text start="394.63" dur="7.74">months into Trump&amp;#39;s presidency and the</text>
  <text start="398.38" dur="6.39">cut the economy collapses well they can</text>
  <text start="402.37" dur="5.76">make the case that because of trumps</text>
  <text start="404.77" dur="5.01">policies his economic policies look what</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="4.259">happened had nothing to do with Obama</text>
  <text start="409.78" dur="4.889">and I believe this is where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="412.389" dur="5.131">moving and this is what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="414.669" dur="6.18">do because we can see this is a complete</text>
  <text start="417.52" dur="6.3">set up now we know the European banks</text>
  <text start="420.849" dur="4.891">they are in a lot of trouble right now</text>
  <text start="423.82" dur="4.92">we know the Italian banks are in trouble</text>
  <text start="425.74" dur="5.37">the German bank deutsche bank is in</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="5.25">trouble and we know the Spanish banks</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="6.869">they are also in trouble now according</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="7.23">to a report banco popular has a</text>
  <text start="437.979" dur="5.541">provision deficit of a well 1.9 billion</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="4.29">euros in other words it has</text>
  <text start="443.52" dur="4.3">non-performing loans and other toxic</text>
  <text start="445.51" dur="5.13">toxic assets on its books who</text>
  <text start="447.82" dur="6.86">whose losses would amount to about 1.9</text>
  <text start="450.64" dur="8.16">billion euros but it has not yet booked</text>
  <text start="454.68" dur="8.08">those losses if it did if it actually</text>
  <text start="458.8" dur="9.63">booked those losses it could end up with</text>
  <text start="462.76" dur="7.47">about 2.4 billion in capital gap that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.43" dur="5.16">the equivalent of roughly sixty percent</text>
  <text start="470.23" dur="6.24">of its current market cap and UBS right</text>
  <text start="473.59" dur="4.64">now is acknowledging that their previous</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="4.5">forecast on the banks capacity to absorb</text>
  <text start="478.23" dur="7.21">loss provisions well they&amp;#39;ve been a</text>
  <text start="480.97" dur="8.55">little too optimistic and we can see</text>
  <text start="485.44" dur="7.68">right now that banco popular is in big</text>
  <text start="489.52" dur="8.4">trouble right now now there could be</text>
  <text start="493.12" dur="7.62">maybe a big european bank or another</text>
  <text start="497.92" dur="4.95">bank maybe they could step in and the</text>
  <text start="500.74" dur="4.59">only way that will happen is if</text>
  <text start="502.87" dur="5.37">Popular&amp;#39;s balance sheets are given a</text>
  <text start="505.33" dur="7.11">thorough spring clean beforehand pay for</text>
  <text start="508.24" dur="7.65">by spain&amp;#39;s taxpayers and we can see that</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="7.38">this is a huge problem because we have</text>
  <text start="515.89" dur="5.85">all these European banks they are</text>
  <text start="519.82" dur="3.599">imploding on themselves and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="521.74" dur="5.04">continually putting band-aid fixes on</text>
  <text start="523.419" dur="5.881">all of them eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="526.78" dur="5.07">happen is one of them is going to go</text>
  <text start="529.3" dur="4.29">down and it&amp;#39;s going to create a domino</text>
  <text start="531.85" dur="4.29">effect and remember there was a report</text>
  <text start="533.59" dur="4.29">out there that the United States the</text>
  <text start="536.14" dur="4.08">banks here in the United States well</text>
  <text start="537.88" dur="4.17">they have some skin in the game where</text>
  <text start="540.22" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re connected to the derivatives in</text>
  <text start="542.05" dur="3.66">the European banks so you can see how</text>
  <text start="543.97" dur="3.33">this is going to play out when</text>
  <text start="545.71" dur="3.75">everything starts to fall about fall</text>
  <text start="547.3" dur="4.23">apart it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete domino</text>
  <text start="549.46" dur="6.6">effect and it will hit the United States</text>
  <text start="551.53" dur="6.78">and when this happens the whole thing</text>
  <text start="556.06" dur="5.85">completely falls apart now the central</text>
  <text start="558.31" dur="6.81">bankers they understand that this is a</text>
  <text start="561.91" dur="5.82">situation where this could go at any</text>
  <text start="565.12" dur="4.32">moment and they don&amp;#39;t want this to go at</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="3.69">any moment they want to bring it down</text>
  <text start="569.44" dur="4.14">themselves they want to bring it down</text>
  <text start="571.42" dur="4.11">under Trump they want to make sure that</text>
  <text start="573.58" dur="4.05">everyone blames him and then of course</text>
  <text start="575.53" dur="3">they&amp;#39;ll link it to Russia because we</text>
  <text start="577.63" dur="3.1">could see what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="578.53" dur="6.309">they&amp;#39;re taking Trump and run</text>
  <text start="580.73" dur="6.84">and like putting them as one and we can</text>
  <text start="584.839" dur="4.951">see at this point this is exactly their</text>
  <text start="587.57" dur="3.93">plan now because they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="589.79" dur="3.75">blamed for this and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="591.5" dur="5.55">right now is they&amp;#39;re inflating these</text>
  <text start="593.54" dur="5.97">bubbles to the biggest bubbles we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="597.05" dur="4.44">ever seen and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="599.51" dur="4.259">happen is the solution is just going to</text>
  <text start="601.49" dur="4.98">come to an end it always does look look</text>
  <text start="603.769" dur="3.93">through history look back in time and</text>
  <text start="606.47" dur="3.09">everyone says well no it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="607.699" dur="5.76">different this time it&amp;#39;s never different</text>
  <text start="609.56" dur="6.269">actually everyone says this it at those</text>
  <text start="613.459" dur="4.951">times back in 2008 it&amp;#39;s different this</text>
  <text start="615.829" dur="4.741">time back in 2001 it&amp;#39;s different this</text>
  <text start="618.41" dur="4.2">time back in nineteen so it&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="620.57" dur="5.49">this time it is never different it is</text>
  <text start="622.61" dur="6.9">always the same and we see right now</text>
  <text start="626.06" dur="6.269">that this system well it&amp;#39;s ripping</text>
  <text start="629.51" dur="4.86">itself apart it&amp;#39;s the tier rating we see</text>
  <text start="632.329" dur="4.351">housing is in trouble retails in trouble</text>
  <text start="634.37" dur="5.75">GDP is one gigantic illusion</text>
  <text start="636.68" dur="7.11">unemployment well that&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="640.12" dur="6.01">manipulated illusion and companies are</text>
  <text start="643.79" dur="6.21">laying off more and more people the</text>
  <text start="646.13" dur="7.41">whole thing is about to come down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="650" dur="5.819">going to crash and those people who are</text>
  <text start="653.54" dur="4.56">not prepared and ready they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="655.819" dur="5.01">be completely shocked all those people</text>
  <text start="658.1" dur="6.15">who are thinking that this is going to</text>
  <text start="660.829" dur="6.271">last forever well I hate to say it it is</text>
  <text start="664.25" dur="4.889">not going to last forever it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="667.1" dur="4.049">fall apart and collapse and all those</text>
  <text start="669.139" dur="4.31">people say no you&amp;#39;ve been saying this</text>
  <text start="671.149" dur="4.831">for a long time when it does happen</text>
  <text start="673.449" dur="4.721">those people are going to scurry off and</text>
  <text start="675.98" dur="3.719">disappear just like they did back in two</text>
  <text start="678.17" dur="4.38">thousand eight when everyone was saying</text>

  <text start="682.55" dur="3.839">and people continually said well you</text>
  <text start="685.01" dur="2.699">just keep on saying it and it&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="686.389" dur="3.63">going to happen and all of a sudden</text>
