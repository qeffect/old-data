  <text start="62.47" dur="5.79">on agricultural products and now it</text>
  <text start="65.049" dur="6.301">really is starting to hurt the European</text>
  <text start="68.26" dur="5.43">markets we&amp;#39;re seeing that because of</text>
  <text start="71.35" dur="5.99">these sanctions and because of what</text>
  <text start="73.69" dur="7.26">Russia did the countries in Europe like</text>

  <text start="104.65" dur="4.74">tractors and trailers to dump artichokes</text>
  <text start="107.049" dur="5.07">cauliflower manure in the streets and</text>

  <text start="112.119" dur="3.18">they cannot cope with the falling prices</text>
  <text start="113.83" dur="4.14">for their products and of course they</text>
  <text start="115.299" dur="5.281">can&amp;#39;t because as we know since they</text>
  <text start="117.97" dur="4.95">cannot sell this merchandise here this</text>
  <text start="120.58" dur="4.71">food what they do is they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="122.92" dur="4.89">it and if you have a lot of surplus</text>
  <text start="125.29" dur="4.259">around prices start to fall and they</text>
  <text start="127.81" dur="3.659">can&amp;#39;t make their money and this is</text>
  <text start="129.549" dur="5.27">exactly what&amp;#39;s happening and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="131.469" dur="5.041">starting to hurt the farmers in Europe</text>
  <text start="134.819" dur="4.441">now</text>
  <text start="136.51" dur="6.119">understand that the United States is</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="4.839">maneuvering military soldiers into the</text>
  <text start="142.629" dur="4.08">West African countries and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="144.099" dur="5.511">pumping in like 88 million dollars into</text>
  <text start="146.709" dur="6.36">this area to help out the so-called</text>
  <text start="149.61" dur="5.019">situation well China is looking at this</text>
  <text start="153.069" dur="2.821">and they&amp;#39;re saying you know what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.629" dur="2.731">going to up the amount of money that</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re going to send to these same exact</text>
  <text start="157.36" dur="6.06">countries they they have up their amount</text>
  <text start="159.79" dur="5.279">to 32.5 four million dollars and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="4.14">saying that they&amp;#39;re going to bring in</text>
  <text start="165.069" dur="4.17">more doctors and more help into these</text>
  <text start="167.56" dur="3.75">same exact countries now we can</text>
  <text start="169.239" dur="4.441">understand why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="171.31" dur="5.009">because they have an interest in these</text>
  <text start="173.68" dur="5.16">countries we understand they have deals</text>
  <text start="176.319" dur="4.2">with many of these countries to help</text>
  <text start="178.84" dur="2.85">with their natural resources or pumping</text>
  <text start="180.519" dur="3.421">in billions of dollars to their</text>
  <text start="181.69" dur="4.26">infrastructure they&amp;#39;re creating railways</text>
  <text start="183.94" dur="4.199">there and now they see the United States</text>
  <text start="185.95" dur="4.95">coming into this region and of course it</text>
  <text start="188.139" dur="4.77">is a fight to capture these countries</text>
  <text start="190.9" dur="4.649">and this is why I keep saying that this</text>
  <text start="192.909" dur="4.531">Ebola outbreak does look like it was a</text>
  <text start="195.549" dur="4.5">tactic of the United States central</text>
  <text start="197.44" dur="5.07">bankers to maneuver soldiers into the</text>
  <text start="200.049" dur="4.921">area to pretty much decimate the</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="5.369">economies to have the banks bail them</text>
  <text start="204.97" dur="4.28">out and of course with any type of virus</text>
  <text start="207.879" dur="3.961">or anything that&amp;#39;s going around</text>
  <text start="209.25" dur="4.449">sometimes you just can&amp;#39;t control it and</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="4.109">sometimes it spreads in other places</text>
  <text start="213.699" dur="5.25">where you didn&amp;#39;t expect it to spread and</text>
  <text start="215.949" dur="5.25">this is why we see all these warnings</text>
  <text start="218.949" dur="5.13">coming out saying that you know this</text>
  <text start="221.199" dur="5.19">could go global this could spread to</text>
  <text start="224.079" dur="6.511">millions of people we had that ship from</text>
  <text start="226.389" dur="6.361">Liberia that docked in Louisiana and of</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="3.66">course CDC and all of them rushed over</text>
  <text start="232.75" dur="4.65">there but they said it was malaria but</text>
  <text start="234.25" dur="5.459">again malaria cannot be given to someone</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="4.38">and you have to be bitten by one of</text>
  <text start="239.709" dur="4.291">these mosquitoes or you can get it from</text>
  <text start="241.78" dur="4.079">a blood transfusion so we can see that</text>
  <text start="244" dur="4.349">this is really starting to ramp up and</text>
  <text start="245.859" dur="4.5">build up and right now we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="248.349" dur="3.991">have to watch all of this very very</text>
  <text start="250.359" dur="4.921">carefully because if it still stays</text>
  <text start="252.34" dur="4.92">contained in these countries and it</text>
  <text start="255.28" dur="5.4">doesn&amp;#39;t spread to any other countries</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="6.48">and nothing else happens then we know</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="6.06">for sure this was manufactured it was</text>
  <text start="263.74" dur="5.78">all a setup it was meant to get into</text>
  <text start="266.74" dur="2.78">these countries</text>
  <text start="269.529" dur="6.9">it looks like the ceasefire in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="272.559" dur="6.36">is pretty much having a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="276.429" dur="4.88">problem right now because I posted this</text>
  <text start="278.919" dur="6.39">on the Sentinel alerts and it seems that</text>
  <text start="281.309" dur="6.37">Russia is being blamed for using a</text>
  <text start="285.309" dur="5.9">tactical nuclear weapon at the Lugansk</text>
  <text start="287.679" dur="5.97">airport now again we understand that</text>
  <text start="291.209" dur="4.54">Ukraine and the pro-russian people we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.649" dur="4.62">making a deal they have the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="295.749" dur="4.32">they were putting the final touches on a</text>
  <text start="298.269" dur="5.61">peace deal and the question we have to</text>
  <text start="300.069" dur="7.83">ask ourselves why in the world would</text>
  <text start="303.879" dur="7.85">Russia use a tactical nuke in this area</text>
  <text start="307.899" dur="6.78">in the south eastern section it makes</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="5.59">absolutely no sense and of course</text>
  <text start="314.679" dur="5.04">Ukraine is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="317.319" dur="6.48">that yes Russia&amp;#39;s the ones who are doing</text>
  <text start="319.719" dur="6.87">it they are they set it up Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="323.799" dur="4.47">media earlier and a quoted saying that</text>
  <text start="326.589" dur="3.39">one of the journalists that Russia army</text>
  <text start="328.269" dur="4.68">had delivered to tactical nuclear</text>
  <text start="329.979" dur="7.47">strikes on the Lugansk airport from a</text>
  <text start="332.949" dur="6.72">self-propelled tie loop had to s4 mortar</text>
  <text start="337.449" dur="6.15">system thus causing the Ukrainian troops</text>
  <text start="339.669" dur="6.39">to leave the area now again it makes no</text>
  <text start="343.599" dur="5.21">sense what would be the motive Russia</text>
  <text start="346.059" dur="5.94">has pretty much brokered the peace deal</text>
  <text start="348.809" dur="6.73">Russia stepped in and said let&amp;#39;s put a</text>
  <text start="351.999" dur="5.28">ceasefire in place and right now why</text>
  <text start="355.539" dur="3.54">would they blow it up and start</text>
  <text start="357.279" dur="5.31">something and I said this in my reports</text>
  <text start="359.079" dur="6.93">going back that Ukraine is still trying</text>
  <text start="362.589" dur="5.16">to start and push this war agenda the</text>
  <text start="366.009" dur="4.23">bankers didn&amp;#39;t get what they wanted and</text>
  <text start="367.749" dur="4.92">we can see already that they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="370.239" dur="5.61">to say yes yes rushes to blame Russia</text>
  <text start="372.669" dur="6.87">shot down the mh17 and we know most of</text>
  <text start="375.849" dur="6.96">this is propaganda now we understand</text>
  <text start="379.539" dur="6.74">what is going on here NATO has been</text>
  <text start="382.809" dur="6.65">infiltrating Ukraine by sending them</text>
  <text start="386.279" dur="5.22">masses amount of military weapons</text>
  <text start="389.459" dur="4.99">poroshenko was in the United States</text>
  <text start="391.499" dur="5.65">looking for military assets and aid</text>
  <text start="394.449" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s a bill floating around which</text>
  <text start="397.149" dur="5.911">would give a lot of military aid and a</text>
  <text start="399.459" dur="6.121">lot of dollars to Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="403.06" dur="6.44">this was all done on purpose and we can</text>
  <text start="405.58" dur="7.62">see that all of this is being ginned up</text>
  <text start="409.5" dur="6.669">to get this war agenda started once</text>
  <text start="413.2" dur="6.719">again and to demonize Russia and here we</text>
  <text start="416.169" dur="7.591">are once again while Putin is out there</text>
  <text start="419.919" dur="6.451">who spoke to poroshenko laid out a peace</text>
  <text start="423.76" dur="5.01">plan where we haven&amp;#39;t heard the United</text>
  <text start="426.37" dur="4.799">States talk about peace at all we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="4.619">never even hear them mention it or let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="431.169" dur="3.75">have a dialogue nothing all they keep</text>
  <text start="433.389" dur="5.371">saying and they only deal in absolutes</text>
  <text start="434.919" dur="6.481">is stop don&amp;#39;t do this we will retaliate</text>
  <text start="438.76" dur="6.06">we will crush you that&amp;#39;s what you hear</text>
  <text start="441.4" dur="7.89">and we can see right now that again the</text>
  <text start="444.82" dur="7.409">bankers Kiev Yatsenyuk they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="449.29" dur="5.61">push this agenda as hard as they</text>
  <text start="452.229" dur="3.871">possibly can and with this is not the</text>
  <text start="454.9" dur="2.97">only thing will say and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="456.1" dur="2.85">see how Russia reacts and already</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re saying this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="458.95" dur="4.29">ridiculous it&amp;#39;s complete propaganda but</text>
  <text start="461.77" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re going to have to see as this goes</text>
  <text start="463.24" dur="4.83">forward and they continually do more and</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="4.14">more to try to get this started what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.07" dur="4.02">going to happen because I&amp;#39;m reading</text>
  <text start="470.08" dur="4.709">reports now that the shelling and the</text>
  <text start="472.09" dur="4.829">firing is not dying down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.789" dur="3.75">intensifying right now and it really</text>
  <text start="476.919" dur="3.571">does look like they&amp;#39;re trying to really</text>
  <text start="478.539" dur="4.38">push this agenda now the Navy the NATO</text>
  <text start="480.49" dur="4.11">chief is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="482.919" dur="4.321">there&amp;#39;s two week old truce between</text>
  <text start="484.6" dur="7.86">Ukraine and the pro-russian militants is</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="7.71">pretty much it name only the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="492.46" dur="7.89">is a name only and it really is</text>
  <text start="494.95" dur="9.54">meaningless okay now we understand that</text>
  <text start="500.35" dur="7.289">the p5 the p5 plus one deal with Iran</text>
  <text start="504.49" dur="6.78">and the other nations are still going on</text>
  <text start="507.639" dur="9.741">and we see what&amp;#39;s happening each time i</text>
  <text start="511.27" dur="9">ran meets the deal and meets the</text>
  <text start="517.38" dur="5.709">agreement the united states central</text>
  <text start="520.27" dur="4.439">bankers seemed to tweak it or change a</text>
  <text start="523.089" dur="2.971">little bit and say you know what we</text>
  <text start="524.709" dur="2.551">really want you to do this now you know</text>
  <text start="526.06" dur="6.63">what we really want you to do this now</text>
  <text start="527.26" dur="8.31">so Iran had the IAEA come back in and</text>
  <text start="532.69" dur="4.71">inspect their nuclear program once again</text>
  <text start="535.57" dur="4.02">and the UN nuclear</text>
  <text start="537.4" dur="3.96">bodies report on Iran including the very</text>
  <text start="539.59" dur="4.08">recent one prove that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="541.36" dur="4.28">Republic has honored the interim nuclear</text>
  <text start="543.67" dur="6.09">deal its sign with the six world powers</text>
  <text start="545.64" dur="6.07">late last year the IAEA has been saying</text>
  <text start="549.76" dur="3.81">all along that Iran has honored the</text>
  <text start="551.71" dur="3.66">agreement that was made in november</text>
  <text start="553.57" dur="4.2">according to a monthly update by the UN</text>
  <text start="555.37" dur="4.38">nuclear agency released on friday a rank</text>
  <text start="557.77" dur="4.95">continues to meet its commitments under</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="5.43">the accord so we can see right now they</text>
  <text start="562.72" dur="5.31">have done everything the other countries</text>
  <text start="565.18" dur="6.03">want them to do but what they put what</text>
  <text start="568.03" dur="5.55">this whole thing is about is is about</text>
  <text start="571.21" dur="5.09">their banking system this nuclear thing</text>
  <text start="573.58" dur="7.23">this is a smokescreen they really want</text>
  <text start="576.3" dur="7.99">their natural resources inside of Iran</text>
  <text start="580.81" dur="5.19">to be put on the US dollar the central</text>
  <text start="584.29" dur="4.14">bankers want to take control of their</text>
  <text start="586" dur="4.8">banks they want to infiltrate their</text>
  <text start="588.43" dur="4.11">country they want to take it over and</text>
  <text start="590.8" dur="4.5">they want to use the US dollar as a</text>
  <text start="592.54" dur="5.94">reserve currency for all oil trade in</text>
  <text start="595.3" dur="5.79">Iran and of course this is a big problem</text>
  <text start="598.48" dur="6.09">and this is why that deal that Obama has</text>
  <text start="601.09" dur="5.16">whether ram is under lock and key nobody</text>
  <text start="604.57" dur="3.51">can really see it there&amp;#39;s only a certain</text>
  <text start="606.25" dur="4.23">number of people they can see it it is</text>
  <text start="608.08" dur="5.46">unclassified but it&amp;#39;s heavily guarded</text>
  <text start="610.48" dur="5.04">and you have to view it in a room you</text>
  <text start="613.54" dur="3.72">cannot have a camera phone you cannot</text>
  <text start="615.52" dur="3.81">take it out you cannot copy it you could</text>
  <text start="617.26" dur="5.01">only read it and only certain people can</text>
  <text start="619.33" dur="4.53">see this deal and we know why because</text>
  <text start="622.27" dur="4.44">this has nothing to do with the nuclear</text>
  <text start="623.86" dur="4.86">deal this is a complete smokescreen to</text>
  <text start="626.71" dur="4.2">convince everyone that this is what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="628.72" dur="3.99">about in the meantime behind closed</text>
  <text start="630.91" dur="3.51">doors they&amp;#39;re trying to get into the</text>
  <text start="632.71" dur="4.2">banking system and this is why the IMF</text>
  <text start="634.42" dur="5.31">has been looking at their banking</text>
  <text start="636.91" dur="4.83">structure and at their banking system</text>
  <text start="639.73" dur="3.39">because eventually they like to get in</text>
  <text start="641.74" dur="3.24">there but I don&amp;#39;t think Iran is going to</text>
  <text start="643.12" dur="4.71">cooperate this is why there&amp;#39;s having a</text>
  <text start="644.98" dur="4.71">very very rough time getting the steel</text>
  <text start="647.83" dur="4.62">closed because every single time the</text>
  <text start="649.69" dur="5.28">IAEA comes out there they say yes</text>
  <text start="652.45" dur="4.26">everything is fine there they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="654.97" dur="3.57">exactly what you want them to do we</text>

  <text start="733.75" dur="3.87">right now they do not want people to</text>

  <text start="768.13" dur="3.93">saying they&amp;#39;re doing something</text>
  <text start="769.24" dur="5.21">completely different different now what</text>
  <text start="772.06" dur="8.73">we see now is that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="774.45" dur="9.97">released 49 hostages to Turkey now this</text>
  <text start="780.79" dur="8.37">is kind of strange because let me say</text>
  <text start="784.42" dur="10.47">they decapitated English and UK citizens</text>
  <text start="789.16" dur="6.96">but they let the hostages go now of</text>
  <text start="794.89" dur="3.24">course we know these videos were</text>
  <text start="796.12" dur="4.17">completely fake phony and false and we</text>
  <text start="798.13" dur="4.23">know that they were not decapitated we</text>
  <text start="800.29" dur="4.65">know that who knows where they are</text>
  <text start="802.36" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re probably living someplace else</text>
  <text start="804.94" dur="3.84">we know that this was a complete setup</text>
  <text start="806.65" dur="4.14">and this was all propaganda but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="808.78" dur="5.01">very interesting we understand that</text>
  <text start="810.79" dur="5.4">turkey has an arrangement with the</text>
  <text start="813.79" dur="5.22">Islamic state where they traffic the oil</text>
  <text start="816.19" dur="4.29">through Turkey out to Europe and we know</text>
  <text start="819.01" dur="3.72">the United States is not going to stop</text>
  <text start="820.48" dur="3.75">them because they can control what the</text>
  <text start="822.73" dur="2.94">Islamic state is doing they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="824.23" dur="3.75">US dollar just like they want them to</text>
  <text start="825.67" dur="5.4">their selling the oil that they get from</text>
  <text start="827.98" dur="5.01">Syria to pay for this covert operation</text>
  <text start="831.07" dur="4.47">right now and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="832.99" dur="5.12">this seems a little strange and even the</text>
  <text start="835.54" dur="5.28">news agencies are out there saying that</text>
  <text start="838.11" dur="5.59">the official explanation sounds a bit</text>
  <text start="840.82" dur="4.83">too good to be true a former Turkish</text>
  <text start="843.7" dur="4.02">diplomat who chairs the istanbul-based</text>
  <text start="845.65" dur="4.89">Center for economics and foreign policy</text>
  <text start="847.72" dur="5.76">studies there are some very legitimate</text>
  <text start="850.54" dur="4.38">and unanswered questions about how this</text>
  <text start="853.48" dur="3.87">all came about and how it happened</text>
  <text start="854.92" dur="5.64">because the Turkish government is saying</text>
  <text start="857.35" dur="4.59">that they did not pay a ransom they</text>
  <text start="860.56" dur="3.63">didn&amp;#39;t do anything and they just</text>
  <text start="861.94" dur="4.68">released a minute is very very odd but</text>
  <text start="864.19" dur="5.52">we know the real reason because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="866.62" dur="4.5">all part of the system and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="869.71" dur="3.45">really think the Islamic state actually</text>
  <text start="871.12" dur="4.71">had them it could have been the tribes</text>
  <text start="873.16" dur="5.49">of the country that kept them hostage</text>
  <text start="875.83" dur="4.32">and they negotiated something where no</text>
  <text start="878.65" dur="3.09">one knew what took place and they</text>
  <text start="880.15" dur="5.16">release them and this had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="881.74" dur="6.15">with the Islamic state whatsoever now</text>
  <text start="885.31" dur="5.34">Russia is still out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="887.89" dur="5.13">saying that the international</text>
  <text start="890.65" dur="4.29">counterterrorism operation should be</text>
  <text start="893.02" dur="4.44">carried out either with the consent of</text>

  <text start="897.46" dur="4.68">Security Council authorization we view</text>
  <text start="899.8" dur="4.74">other options as illegal and undermining</text>

  <text start="923.14" dur="5.67">military action and they&amp;#39;re saying right</text>
  <text start="925.72" dur="5.61">now that if the United States wants to</text>
  <text start="928.81" dur="4.89">do this then it has to be with all the</text>
  <text start="931.33" dur="4.44">countries in the United Nations getting</text>
  <text start="933.7" dur="4.17">a vote on it and not the United States</text>
  <text start="935.77" dur="2.55">just going in there because they want to</text>
  <text start="937.87" dur="3.93">go in</text>
  <text start="938.32" dur="6">and really the question is why is the</text>
  <text start="941.8" dur="5.34">United States going in there think about</text>
  <text start="944.32" dur="5.16">it for a second Syria has not attacked</text>
  <text start="947.14" dur="5.34">the Islamic state has not attacked the</text>
  <text start="949.48" dur="6.24">United States what reasoning do they</text>
  <text start="952.48" dur="7.08">actually have at this point Syria is</text>
  <text start="955.72" dur="6.18">taking the matters in in their own hands</text>
  <text start="959.56" dur="4.29">inside Syria they&amp;#39;re bombing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="961.9" dur="4.17">state they&amp;#39;re hitting them down pushing</text>
  <text start="963.85" dur="4.02">them back even though here the corporate</text>
  <text start="966.07" dur="3.84">media wants you to believe that oh no</text>
  <text start="967.87" dur="4.26">the Islamic states so big they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="969.91" dur="4.98">spread out all over the place no what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="972.13" dur="4.56">happening is Syria is doing the job</text>
  <text start="974.89" dur="3.87">pushing them back just with the Free</text>
  <text start="976.69" dur="4.47">Syrian Army because actually they&amp;#39;re one</text>
  <text start="978.76" dur="4.53">in the same really and we can see that</text>
  <text start="981.16" dur="3.87">they don&amp;#39;t want that information getting</text>
  <text start="983.29" dur="3.81">out there so they keep using the</text>
  <text start="985.03" dur="3.69">propaganda that they&amp;#39;re growing more</text>
  <text start="987.1" dur="3.54">people are coming into it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="988.72" dur="4.68">spreading all over the private western</text>
  <text start="990.64" dur="5.01">central bank countries and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="993.4" dur="3.51">a hundred here forty there and this is</text>
  <text start="995.65" dur="3.77">why they have no numbers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="996.91" dur="6.12">keeping everything confused right now</text>
  <text start="999.42" dur="6.01">now the European Center for information</text>
  <text start="1003.03" dur="6.18">policy and security they&amp;#39;re saying if</text>
  <text start="1005.43" dur="6.3">this Isis problem is as big as they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1009.21" dur="3.84">saying now of course we know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1011.73" dur="4.23">really going on here but they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1013.05" dur="4.95">if there is a terrorist threat like this</text>
  <text start="1015.96" dur="4.83">then we have a huge huge problem and</text>
  <text start="1018" dur="7.74">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the borders</text>
  <text start="1020.79" dur="8.399">are not secure enough the EC IPS</text>
  <text start="1025.74" dur="5.16">president Barrett Barrett ski said that</text>
  <text start="1029.189" dur="3.421">this warrants an immediate alert to</text>

  <text start="1062.67" dur="3.51">right after the elections they want to</text>
  <text start="1064.83" dur="2.88">keep the borders open because they want</text>
  <text start="1066.18" dur="2.94">the illegal immigrants continually</text>

  <text start="1100.82" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s becoming very very confusing but</text>
  <text start="1103.13" dur="6.539">now the EC IPS is issuing an extensive</text>

  <text start="1148.13" dur="6.019">Australia is on high alert because of</text>
  <text start="1150.62" dur="6.21">what happened there where they had dupes</text>

  <text start="1185.69" dur="9.45">in a couple reports back there is a new</text>
