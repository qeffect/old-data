  <text start="106.11" dur="4.289">instance and every time we look at</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="3.63">housing the corporate media the US</text>

  <text start="117.209" dur="4.47">drying up and they&amp;#39;re making it seem</text>
  <text start="119.039" dur="5.521">like housing is the best thing since</text>
  <text start="121.679" dur="7.011">sliced bread and it&amp;#39;s incredible right</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="8.1">now but we see housing deteriorating in</text>
  <text start="128.69" dur="6.25">many locations it is falling apart right</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="4.38">in front of our eyes if you know where</text>
  <text start="134.94" dur="6.11">to look you can see what is happening</text>
  <text start="137.04" dur="8.58">and we&amp;#39;ve been looking in these areas</text>
  <text start="141.05" dur="6.97">for instance in Vancouver home sales</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="6.15">have fallen by twenty six percent from a</text>
  <text start="148.02" dur="6.51">year earlier and when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="151.77" dur="5.07">can see that the situation in Vancouver</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="4.59">and many other places like Australia in</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="4.86">many different cities inside of the</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="4.949">United States housing is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="4.379">very very quickly d</text>
  <text start="164.069" dur="5.881">properties were hit the hardest and</text>

  <text start="174.12" dur="7.28">price of the detached vancouver property</text>
  <text start="177.689" dur="6.63">has dropped by seventeen percent and</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="4.959">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this</text>
  <text start="184.319" dur="4.32">housing bubble that the central banks</text>
  <text start="186.359" dur="5.49">have created not just here in the united</text>
  <text start="188.639" dur="6.93">states around the world they&amp;#39;re popping</text>
  <text start="191.849" dur="6.331">I can see it in the northeastern section</text>
  <text start="195.569" dur="6.06">of the United States down in the south</text>
  <text start="198.18" dur="5.399">in the Midwest and out west now yes</text>
  <text start="201.629" dur="4.14">there are certain cities where the</text>
  <text start="203.579" dur="4.231">central bank the US government they have</text>
  <text start="205.769" dur="4.8">the ability to control the markets but</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="5.429">they can&amp;#39;t control every market and what</text>
  <text start="210.569" dur="5.521">we&amp;#39;re starting to see is all these</text>
  <text start="213.239" dur="5.46">outlying markets they are deteriorating</text>
  <text start="216.09" dur="5.609">very rapidly houses are sitting on the</text>
  <text start="218.699" dur="5.581">market for a hundred and fifty days 180</text>
  <text start="221.699" dur="4.41">days individuals are continually</text>
  <text start="224.28" dur="4.859">lowering the prices and we can see right</text>
  <text start="226.109" dur="5.49">now the situation is getting worse as</text>
  <text start="229.139" dur="4.53">time goes on and as we enter this fall</text>
  <text start="231.599" dur="3.72">going into the winter months the</text>
  <text start="233.669" dur="5.761">situation is going to deteriorate very</text>
  <text start="235.319" dur="6.961">very quickly now we see Obama he is out</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="6.69">in China and he arrived in China for the</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="6.179">g20 meeting and we already see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="246.12" dur="4.729">draft of a communique that&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="248.459" dur="8.52">been leaked from the g20 meeting and</text>
  <text start="250.849" dur="8.67">this meeting is already preset they</text>
  <text start="256.979" dur="4.831">already know what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="259.519" dur="4.751">they understand that the economy is</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="6.06">falling apart they understand the debt</text>
  <text start="264.27" dur="7.32">level is too high so what does this tell</text>
  <text start="267.87" dur="7.139">us there&amp;#39;s more stimulus coming why do</text>
  <text start="271.59" dur="5.25">you think the Fed was out there and they</text>
  <text start="275.009" dur="4.351">put out this report telling everyone</text>
  <text start="276.84" dur="6.66">that just in case there&amp;#39;s an economic</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="8.279">shock we are ready to do QE either a 2</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="7.409">trillion per year or three or four or as</text>
  <text start="287.639" dur="5.25">I would say much much more than that but</text>
  <text start="290.909" dur="7.191">what&amp;#39;s very interesting as Obama arrived</text>
  <text start="292.889" dur="9.351">in China there was no staircase for</text>
  <text start="298.1" dur="5.97">the plane the president was forced to</text>
  <text start="302.24" dur="6.09">use the emergency exit for his final</text>
  <text start="304.07" dur="8.76">arrival in China China is actually</text>
  <text start="308.33" dur="7.89">snubbing the US president and we can see</text>
  <text start="312.83" dur="6.75">right now that China Russia and North</text>
  <text start="316.22" dur="5.55">Korea all those countries that do not</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="5.31">belong to this private west central</text>
  <text start="321.77" dur="4.8">bank&amp;#39;s system they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="324.89" dur="4.53">United States right now and the central</text>
  <text start="326.57" dur="5.97">bankers and saying we are not going to</text>
  <text start="329.42" dur="4.56">follow along in what you&amp;#39;re doing we</text>
  <text start="332.54" dur="3.24">understand that the United States is in</text>
  <text start="333.98" dur="7.05">the Pacific and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="335.78" dur="8.61">provoking China at every turn but we can</text>
  <text start="341.03" dur="5.46">see that China and Russia they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="344.39" dur="3.93">to keep the peace they understand what</text>
  <text start="346.49" dur="4.29">the central bankers want they understand</text>
  <text start="348.32" dur="4.32">the central bankers their system is</text>
  <text start="350.78" dur="3.06">dying and when I say the central bankers</text>
  <text start="352.64" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;m talking about the private western</text>
  <text start="353.84" dur="5.24">central bankers the Rothschilds their</text>
  <text start="356.24" dur="7.47">system is dying right now the dollar</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="5.86">it&amp;#39;s at its end game and we can see it</text>
  <text start="363.71" dur="3.78">by looking at all these countries</text>
  <text start="364.94" dur="5.34">because they&amp;#39;re getting rid of their US</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="5.34">Treasuries we understand that china is</text>
  <text start="370.28" dur="4.17">the single largest holder of US</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="4.53">Treasuries right now outside the federal</text>
  <text start="374.45" dur="4.53">reserve of course and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="377.36" dur="5.7">accumulated nearly about a trillion</text>
  <text start="378.98" dur="7.5">dollars in US Treasury since 2000 in</text>
  <text start="383.06" dur="7.62">total choad China now holds about 1.2 4</text>
  <text start="386.48" dur="6.96">trillion and US Treasuries China ceased</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="6.03">accumulating these Treasuries in July of</text>
  <text start="393.44" dur="7.46">2011 and has been net selling the US</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="7.05">Treasuries since now since July 2011</text>

  <text start="403.76" dur="8.45">in US trade surplus dollars and through</text>
  <text start="406.4" dur="10.67">recycled none of them into US Treasuries</text>
  <text start="412.21" dur="9.91">so where do they put this what they do</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="10.45">with the surplus dollars China has been</text>
  <text start="422.12" dur="9.449">buying gold they&amp;#39;ve been buying a lot of</text>
  <text start="427.52" dur="6.72">gold they understand what is coming</text>

  <text start="509.079" dur="5.291">warships into this area because</text>
  <text start="511.879" dur="3.931">eventually just like we knew the United</text>
  <text start="514.37" dur="3.659">States was going to be going into Libya</text>
  <text start="515.81" dur="4.829">the rest of the coalition forces and</text>
  <text start="518.029" dur="4.94">most of them already have teams on the</text>
  <text start="520.639" dur="6.151">ground they&amp;#39;ll be bringing in heavier</text>
  <text start="522.969" dur="5.56">military assets into the area we see</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="4.169">Russia and Turkey right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="528.529" dur="4.05">moving closer to a free-trade deal of</text>
  <text start="530.959" dur="4.05">course we understand they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="532.579" dur="5.101">about the Turkish stream and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.009" dur="5.7">talking about many other deals we</text>
  <text start="537.68" dur="5.909">understand that Turkey they have invaded</text>
  <text start="540.709" dur="7.68">Syria we understand this is an 80 US</text>
  <text start="543.589" dur="7.05">mission we realize the u.s. try to pull</text>
  <text start="548.389" dur="5.521">off this coup in Turkey it didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="550.639" dur="6.271">out so Obama during the g20 meeting he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.91" dur="4.89">out there saying that the United States</text>
  <text start="556.91" dur="3.84">has committed to bringing those</text>
  <text start="558.8" dur="4.92">responsible for turkeys attempted coup</text>
  <text start="560.75" dur="4">to justice which means nothing&amp;#39;s ever</text>
  <text start="563.72" dur="3.22">going to happen</text>
  <text start="564.75" dur="6.06">because the United States was behind it</text>
  <text start="566.94" dur="6.09">and he went on to say listen if turkey</text>
  <text start="570.81" dur="4.62">can present proof that Gulen was</text>
  <text start="573.03" dur="4.95">responsible for this we will extradite</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="4.79">him right away now we know the CIA was</text>
  <text start="577.98" dur="6">involved we understand the United States</text>
  <text start="580.22" dur="8.23">was involved in all of this and we</text>
  <text start="583.98" dur="6.93">realized right now that Obama as he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="588.45" dur="3.75">saying this is lying we know that</text>
  <text start="590.91" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re never going to bring themselves</text>
  <text start="592.2" dur="7.65">to justice it makes no sense turkey</text>
  <text start="596.58" dur="5.85">right now has opened up a new military</text>
  <text start="599.85" dur="4.74">Battlefront Turkish tanks and armored</text>
  <text start="602.43" dur="4.5">vehicles they&amp;#39;ve entered Syria in the</text>
  <text start="604.59" dur="4.47">northern province of Aleppo opening up</text>
  <text start="606.93" dur="5.61">yet another battlefront within last two</text>
  <text start="609.06" dur="5.28">weeks you&amp;#39;re using leopard tanks &amp;amp; M 60t</text>
  <text start="612.54" dur="5.22">tanks which are involved in the</text>
  <text start="614.34" dur="9.21">offensive and we can see right now they</text>
  <text start="617.76" dur="9">are pushing in this area the US who</text>
  <text start="623.55" dur="8.82">provided the high mar rocket launchers</text>
  <text start="626.76" dur="9.39">to turkey they are using them to strike</text>
  <text start="632.37" dur="5.43">into Syria now now we know that the</text>
  <text start="636.15" dur="5.1">United States didn&amp;#39;t provide these</text>
  <text start="637.8" dur="5.46">missile launchers just to have them sit</text>
  <text start="641.25" dur="4.35">there on the border we knew eventually</text>
  <text start="643.26" dur="4.5">they were going to be used and we can</text>
  <text start="645.6" dur="4.56">see this is the beginning stages of a</text>
  <text start="647.76" dur="5.22">much deeper offensive that is coming</text>
  <text start="650.16" dur="6.6">remember what happened in the past where</text>
  <text start="652.98" dur="6.09">Ashton Carter visited all the different</text>
  <text start="656.76" dur="4.47">coalition forces and asked each country</text>
  <text start="659.07" dur="4.92">to bring in more and more military</text>
  <text start="661.23" dur="6.93">assets do you really think this plan</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="5.76">only involves Turkey no we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="668.16" dur="4.89">Special Op teams already on the ground</text>
  <text start="669.75" dur="7.5">we already understand the US has no</text>
  <text start="673.05" dur="8.73">choice at this point we know Russia is</text>
  <text start="677.25" dur="6.6">trying to formulate and push a peace</text>
  <text start="681.78" dur="3.84">deal with the United States now the</text>
  <text start="683.85" dur="4.17">United States the only way they&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="685.62" dur="6.63">peace in this area is if Assad is</text>
  <text start="688.02" dur="7.77">removed or at the same time I saw is</text>
  <text start="692.25" dur="5.55">removed and they can separate Syria into</text>
  <text start="695.79" dur="2.61">different areas they would take that</text>
  <text start="697.8" dur="3.03">leave</text>
  <text start="698.4" dur="6.48">sod in Damascus in a little tiny section</text>
  <text start="700.83" dur="6.63">and split up the rest of Syria and we</text>
  <text start="704.88" dur="4.35">can see right now the talks have come to</text>
  <text start="707.46" dur="3.06">an end there is no deal right now</text>
  <text start="709.23" dur="3.33">because Russia is looking at the</text>
  <text start="710.52" dur="4.26">situation and they keep coming back to</text>
  <text start="712.56" dur="4.59">the same thing listen we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="714.78" dur="4.62">be splitting up Syria the people have to</text>
  <text start="717.15" dur="4.56">decide that and we&amp;#39;re not removing Assad</text>
  <text start="719.4" dur="5.16">because that&amp;#39;s up to the people if the</text>
  <text start="721.71" dur="6.12">people decide not to keep him in power</text>
  <text start="724.56" dur="5.31">which I mean Assad they will vote and</text>
  <text start="727.83" dur="5.25">they will decide who their leaders going</text>
  <text start="729.87" dur="4.98">to be an outside force is not going to</text>
  <text start="733.08" dur="3.78">make the decision for the people of that</text>
  <text start="734.85" dur="3.36">country because you remember the United</text>
  <text start="736.86" dur="2.79">States they don&amp;#39;t care and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="738.21" dur="4.08">about the United States government they</text>
  <text start="739.65" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t care about democracy freedom look</text>
  <text start="742.29" dur="3.39">what they did to the Libyan people they</text>
  <text start="743.91" dur="5.7">forced a government on them which they</text>
  <text start="745.68" dur="5.79">did not choose the same thing happened</text>
  <text start="749.61" dur="5.13">in Ukraine actually the same thing</text>
  <text start="751.47" dur="6.5">happened throughout the Middle East now</text>
  <text start="754.74" dur="6.83">we&amp;#39;re getting some information that</text>
  <text start="757.97" dur="7.42">Mossad they are training special spies</text>
  <text start="761.57" dur="6.19">to assassinate certain key leaders in</text>
  <text start="765.39" dur="5.28">the Middle East which I mean like Iran</text>
  <text start="767.76" dur="5.76">maybe maybe Syria and other areas where</text>
  <text start="770.67" dur="4.74">there are problems and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="773.52" dur="3.66">have to watch this situation very very</text>
  <text start="775.41" dur="5.39">carefully because I said the only way to</text>
  <text start="777.18" dur="7.71">get Assad out of power at this point is</text>
  <text start="780.8" dur="5.68">to have an assassination or to have an</text>
  <text start="784.89" dur="5.88">all-out war which it really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="786.48" dur="9.66">matter at that point so at this time we</text>
  <text start="790.77" dur="8.28">can see that the powers at be which is</text>
  <text start="796.14" dur="10.11">Israel which is the United States UK</text>
  <text start="799.05" dur="10.67">Spain France Turkey the only way to get</text>
  <text start="806.25" dur="8.7">Assad out of power is to remove him and</text>
  <text start="809.72" dur="9.73">to remove him means to kill him and if</text>
  <text start="814.95" dur="8.4">they can pull this off they&amp;#39;re one step</text>
  <text start="819.45" dur="6.96">closer into capturing Syria so I believe</text>
  <text start="823.35" dur="5.94">this might be their next move because we</text>
  <text start="826.41" dur="4.56">can see the United States will not have</text>
  <text start="829.29" dur="2.85">any type of peace with Russia I know</text>
  <text start="830.97" dur="2.7">Russia continually try</text>
  <text start="832.14" dur="3.87">eyes they&amp;#39;re trying to calm the</text>
  <text start="833.67" dur="3.54">situation down but you have to remember</text>
  <text start="836.01" dur="4.23">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="837.21" dur="6.75">bankers they have a goal their goal is</text>
  <text start="840.24" dur="6.72">to capture Syria to get rid of Assad to</text>
  <text start="843.96" dur="5.43">build the pipeline to place the private</text>
  <text start="846.96" dur="3.75">western central bank inside Syria to</text>
  <text start="849.39" dur="4.17">place the dollar on their natural</text>
  <text start="850.71" dur="5.88">resources which is oil then move into a</text>
  <text start="853.56" dur="4.89">ram this has been the plan since the</text>
  <text start="856.59" dur="3.81">beginning they haven&amp;#39;t deviated from</text>
  <text start="858.45" dur="5.88">this plan yes it&amp;#39;s been taking a very</text>
  <text start="860.4" dur="6.9">long time we need to understand right</text>
  <text start="864.33" dur="5.19">now that all indicators are pointing to</text>
  <text start="867.3" dur="3.72">this type of scenario now it might</text>
  <text start="869.52" dur="2.91">change around a little bit it might be</text>
  <text start="871.02" dur="4.08">able to end up a little different</text>
  <text start="872.43" dur="4.5">because every plan is not foolproof but</text>
  <text start="875.1" dur="3.63">we need to watch what is happening right</text>
  <text start="876.93" dur="4.56">now because we can see we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="878.73" dur="6.05">into this fall the economies around the</text>
  <text start="881.49" dur="7.86">world they are deteriorating rapidly</text>
  <text start="884.78" dur="7">retail awful GDP manipulated and even</text>
  <text start="889.35" dur="4.08">the manipulated number awful we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="891.78" dur="3.69">looking at housing it is falling apart</text>
  <text start="893.43" dur="4.62">very very quickly and when housing falls</text>
  <text start="895.47" dur="4.32">apart people start to wake up and they</text>
  <text start="898.05" dur="3.69">start to realize that something&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="899.79" dur="4.59">with the economy the second thing if the</text>
  <text start="901.74" dur="5.61">stock market doesn&amp;#39;t continually rise</text>
  <text start="904.38" dur="5.22">and that falls between housing and the</text>
  <text start="907.35" dur="3.84">stock market people really wake up and</text>
  <text start="909.6" dur="4.41">they understand that something is wrong</text>
  <text start="911.19" dur="4.41">so even if we have housing falling apart</text>
  <text start="914.01" dur="3.72">many of the people are going to say okay</text>
  <text start="915.6" dur="3.66">something is wrong here just like back</text>
  <text start="917.73" dur="3.18">in two thousand eight the market was</text>
  <text start="919.26" dur="3.6">still up high but housing was</text>
  <text start="920.91" dur="3.39">deteriorating very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="922.86" dur="3.27">things started to rapidly fall apart</text>
  <text start="924.3" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re starting to see the same exact</text>
  <text start="926.13" dur="4.11">thing right now and people are going to</text>
  <text start="928.68" dur="4.22">be waking up because I&amp;#39;ve been speaking</text>
  <text start="930.24" dur="5.37">to a lot of people and they&amp;#39;re realizing</text>
  <text start="932.9" dur="4.69">there is something wrong with the real</text>
  <text start="935.61" dur="3.45">estate market everything that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="937.59" dur="3.36">out of the US government the central</text>
  <text start="939.06" dur="3.78">bankers people are saying I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="940.95" dur="4.74">believe them because it&amp;#39;s not happening</text>
  <text start="942.84" dur="5.64">in my area anymore things are have</text>
  <text start="945.69" dur="5.88">rapidly changed something is not right</text>
  <text start="948.48" dur="5.4">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the US</text>
  <text start="951.57" dur="5.31">government central bankers the clock is</text>
  <text start="953.88" dur="5.64">ticking down we can see there is no</text>
  <text start="956.88" dur="5.43">peace deal in Syria which means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="959.52" dur="4.32">moving closer and closer to this main</text>
  <text start="962.31" dur="3.69">event because they&amp;#39;ve been giving us all</text>
  <text start="963.84" dur="4.62">these indicators about</text>
  <text start="966" dur="5.76">the banks how they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="968.46" dur="5.97">balance how the fed is preparing for an</text>
  <text start="971.76" dur="4.77">economic shock how the president decided</text>
  <text start="974.43" dur="4.02">to have this executive order with the</text>
  <text start="976.53" dur="5.55">succession of the Secretary of Treasury</text>
  <text start="978.45" dur="5.85">and we can see many things are occurring</text>
  <text start="982.08" dur="5.13">all at once and this is what we need to</text>
  <text start="984.3" dur="6.12">watch because we&amp;#39;re heading into this</text>
  <text start="987.21" dur="5.99">full time period and we can see that</text>
  <text start="990.42" dur="5.58">things are rapidly falling apart and</text>
  <text start="993.2" dur="5.19">when everything goes south they will</text>
  <text start="996" dur="4.47">give the green light for the main event</text>
