  <text start="62.57" dur="5.939">24th 2018 and the title of the episode</text>
  <text start="65.299" dur="6.151">is did Trump just lay out the plan to</text>
  <text start="68.509" dur="5.64">get rid of the Fed let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.45" dur="5.58">economic collapse financial news now as</text>
  <text start="74.149" dur="5.25">we watch the economy slide to the</text>
  <text start="77.03" dur="3.6">downside and everything starts to fall</text>
  <text start="79.399" dur="2.97">apart I mean we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="80.63" dur="2.76">homes autos which we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking</text>
  <text start="82.369" dur="4.56">about in just a minute</text>
  <text start="83.39" dur="6.539">one thing that is completely constant in</text>
  <text start="86.929" dur="6.061">all of this is that Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="89.929" dur="6.621">and he continually criticizes the Fed</text>
  <text start="92.99" dur="7.71">and what we are watching right now is</text>
  <text start="96.55" dur="7.179">Trump setting up the narrative to bring</text>
  <text start="100.7" dur="4.02">down the Federal Reserve to bring it to</text>
  <text start="103.729" dur="5.401">its knees</text>
  <text start="104.72" dur="6.989">to set up a way to audit it to expose it</text>
  <text start="109.13" dur="5.07">to the people of America to expose it to</text>
  <text start="111.709" dur="5.881">the people of the world in what the</text>
  <text start="114.2" dur="5.429">central bank does remember the plan is</text>
  <text start="117.59" dur="5.13">not to just go after the deep state it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="119.629" dur="6.24">to go after the source of their funding</text>
  <text start="122.72" dur="5.039">to go after the source of what made the</text>
  <text start="125.869" dur="3.571">deep State and what made the deep state</text>
  <text start="127.759" dur="5.791">it was easy money</text>
  <text start="129.44" dur="5.97">it was the Fed printing money out of</text>
  <text start="133.55" dur="4.439">thin air and the government borrowing</text>
  <text start="135.41" dur="3.24">and it wasn&amp;#39;t tied to checks and</text>
  <text start="137.989" dur="2.551">balances</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="5.52">they were just able to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="140.54" dur="6.86">wanted with this currency and as we</text>
  <text start="144.17" dur="8.099">watched the entire economic system</text>
  <text start="147.4" dur="7.059">deteriorate well it looks like Trump is</text>
  <text start="152.269" dur="5.58">gonna continually point the finger at</text>
  <text start="154.459" dur="7.67">the Fed and as we watch the economy</text>
  <text start="157.849" dur="7.53">slide into a recession a depression</text>
  <text start="162.129" dur="6.22">Trump is gonna continually come out more</text>
  <text start="165.379" dur="5.58">so than ever before to contradict and</text>
  <text start="168.349" dur="6.601">actually tell you what the Fed is doing</text>
  <text start="170.959" dur="6.301">and why the economy is falling apart now</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="4.23">when we look at the economy we can see</text>
  <text start="177.26" dur="5.339">that October auto sales</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="7.11">they have tumbled I mean dealerships</text>
  <text start="182.599" dur="4.731">around the country are saying that car</text>
  <text start="186.29" dur="5.77">sales are</text>
  <text start="187.33" dur="7.56">down 12% traffic is drying up now a</text>
  <text start="192.06" dur="5.2">couple reports ago we talked about how</text>
  <text start="194.89" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re changing the credit scores I</text>
  <text start="197.26" dur="4.62">wonder if this is why because they</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="5.1">realize as the system breaks down those</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="4.77">people with bank credit they need better</text>
  <text start="204.13" dur="4.35">credit so they can take on more debt or</text>
  <text start="206.65" dur="4.5">they need better credit to get a</text>
  <text start="208.48" dur="5.22">automobile and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="211.15" dur="6.24">exactly what is happening here new home</text>
  <text start="213.7" dur="6.12">sales this is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="217.39" dur="3.69">right in front of our eyes new home</text>
  <text start="219.82" dur="4.2">sales right now in September they</text>
  <text start="221.08" dur="5.52">plunged to their lowest since December</text>
  <text start="224.02" dur="7.61">2016 crashing by five point five percent</text>
  <text start="226.6" dur="9.24">month a month we&amp;#39;re also seeing a 13.2%</text>
  <text start="231.63" dur="7.84">collapse from last year this is the</text>
  <text start="235.84" dur="7.8">biggest drop since May 2011 and we know</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="6.81">what happened in 2009-2010 we went fully</text>
  <text start="243.64" dur="4.86">into the Great Recession we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="5.13">starting to see sale prices they have</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="4.58">declined three and a half percent from a</text>
  <text start="251.41" dur="4.829">year ago</text>
  <text start="253.08" dur="4.51">this is a complete and utter disaster we</text>
  <text start="256.239" dur="3.87">know why it&amp;#39;s happening we discussed</text>
  <text start="257.59" dur="4.95">this many times as the Fed raises its</text>
  <text start="260.109" dur="4.711">rates it&amp;#39;s going to affect the housing</text>
  <text start="262.54" dur="3.75">industry and things are going to fall</text>
  <text start="264.82" dur="7.47">apart and this is going to affect other</text>
  <text start="266.29" dur="9.06">industries lumber copper roofing tar you</text>
  <text start="272.29" dur="6.75">name it concrete it&amp;#39;s going to affect</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="7.01">many different industries now while this</text>
  <text start="279.04" dur="6.6">is happening the supply of homes is</text>
  <text start="282.36" dur="6.04">rising right now so that whole argument</text>
  <text start="285.64" dur="4.92">that oh there&amp;#39;s no houses on the market</text>
  <text start="288.4" dur="4.25">this is why people aren&amp;#39;t buying well</text>
  <text start="290.56" dur="5.07">this is falling by the wayside now</text>
  <text start="292.65" dur="5.25">because if we go back a couple of months</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="6.3">we had about six and a half months of</text>
  <text start="297.9" dur="8.47">supply now we have 7.1 months and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="5.1">rising very very quickly something is</text>
  <text start="306.37" dur="4.43">wrong</text>
  <text start="307.03" dur="6.84">the housing market is falling apart and</text>
  <text start="310.8" dur="5.41">it&amp;#39;s happening very fast actually if we</text>
  <text start="313.87" dur="5.07">look in the northeast section of the</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="4.71">country we saw a decline in purchases</text>
  <text start="318.94" dur="5.4">around 40 point 6</text>
  <text start="320.92" dur="5.13">percent I mean really think about what</text>
  <text start="324.34" dur="4.35">is happening here and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="326.05" dur="4.53">watching and following the housing</text>
  <text start="328.69" dur="4.11">market for a very long time and it is</text>
  <text start="330.58" dur="4.26">completely falling apart it was falling</text>
  <text start="332.8" dur="5.67">apart before but now since the Fed is</text>
  <text start="334.84" dur="7.11">raising rates its accelerating now if we</text>
  <text start="338.47" dur="6.72">go back in time I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="341.95" dur="7.26">what we saw prior to other recessions</text>
  <text start="345.19" dur="6.6">and show everyone that it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="4.71">difficult to look at statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="351.79" dur="4.05">and try to make heads or tails if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.92" dur="4.29">heading into a recession this is why we</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="5.37">have to go past this and look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.21" dur="5.58">really going on at the peoples level so</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="6.06">let&amp;#39;s go back in time stock prices hit</text>
  <text start="363.79" dur="6.48">an all-time high in October of 2007 the</text>
  <text start="367.27" dur="7.32">latest GDP data showed we hit 4 percent</text>
  <text start="370.27" dur="7.2">in the second quarter equally strong</text>
  <text start="374.59" dur="4.86">third quarter in GDP growth so we hit 4</text>
  <text start="377.47" dur="6.21">percent in second quarter around 4</text>
  <text start="379.45" dur="7.79">percent in third quarter and we can see</text>
  <text start="383.68" dur="5.91">that everything was fine in 2007</text>
  <text start="387.24" dur="4.87">remember this was right on the verge of</text>
  <text start="389.59" dur="6.9">the Great Recession which began in</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="6.12">December of 2007 but the thing is they</text>
  <text start="396.49" dur="3.68">didn&amp;#39;t tell us this is when it began</text>
  <text start="398.23" dur="6.06">they told us that everything was fine in</text>
  <text start="400.17" dur="6.13">June of 2008 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke</text>
  <text start="404.29" dur="4.73">declared that the risk of a substantial</text>
  <text start="406.3" dur="5.88">downturn appears to have diminished</text>
  <text start="409.02" dur="6.16">stressing the upside risks to inflation</text>
  <text start="412.18" dur="5.04">instead the futures market agreed</text>
  <text start="415.18" dur="4.02">wholeheartedly betting on more than a</text>
  <text start="417.22" dur="5.55">full percentage point of Fed rate hikes</text>
  <text start="419.2" dur="5.73">by year n this was smack in the middle</text>
  <text start="422.77" dur="4.17">of what turned out to be the worst</text>
  <text start="424.93" dur="7.14">recession since the Great Depression so</text>
  <text start="426.94" dur="7.2">when he said this in 2008 we were</text>
  <text start="432.07" dur="5.01">already in the recession because it</text>
  <text start="434.14" dur="6.54">started in 2007 and he was telling us</text>
  <text start="437.08" dur="5.9">there were no problems when Lehman</text>
  <text start="440.68" dur="5.7">Brothers collapsed in August 2008 the</text>
  <text start="442.98" dur="7.18">GDP data showed it rising in every</text>
  <text start="446.38" dur="5.52">single quarter since 2001 we had a</text>
  <text start="450.16" dur="4.15">little dip here and there but it was</text>
  <text start="451.9" dur="6.62">moving up</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="7.51">what this tells us is that even though</text>
  <text start="458.52" dur="4.68">GDP was up unemployment was very low the</text>
  <text start="461.82" dur="4.83">Fed coming out telling us that</text>
  <text start="463.2" dur="5.9">everything was fine we were in a</text>
  <text start="466.65" dur="6.21">recession that started in December of</text>
  <text start="469.1" dur="5.74">2007 remembered they don&amp;#39;t tell you when</text>
  <text start="472.86" dur="3.21">it started right now I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.84" dur="3.18">looking at it and saying we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="476.07" dur="3.72">recession right now we&amp;#39;ve been in a</text>
  <text start="478.02" dur="4.41">recession for quite awhile the</text>
  <text start="479.79" dur="4.8">statistical numbers are the illusion</text>
  <text start="482.43" dur="5.239">that people think that the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484.59" dur="6.18">fine just like in 2007 of December and</text>
  <text start="487.669" dur="4.571">2008 of January February March April</text>
  <text start="490.77" dur="3.99">everyone thought everything was great</text>
  <text start="492.24" dur="5.52">until October when the market came down</text>
  <text start="494.76" dur="4.82">but then we go back in time well they</text>
  <text start="497.76" dur="6.15">said the recession actually started in</text>
  <text start="499.58" dur="5.89">2007 and remember in August companies</text>
  <text start="503.91" dur="4.88">were having problems left and right and</text>
  <text start="505.47" dur="5.94">we really didn&amp;#39;t know much about them</text>
  <text start="508.79" dur="4.059">what&amp;#39;s happening now is the same thing</text>
  <text start="511.41" dur="4.05">that happened all these other times but</text>
  <text start="512.849" dur="5.041">it&amp;#39;s much much worse and the plan is a</text>
  <text start="515.46" dur="5.43">little different because the Fed is not</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="5.01">controlling this right now so these</text>
  <text start="520.89" dur="3.66">numbers are not a gauge of the economy</text>
  <text start="522.9" dur="4.56">even though Trump is putting it out</text>
  <text start="524.55" dur="6.57">there he&amp;#39;s using the deep state central</text>
  <text start="527.46" dur="7.17">bank weapons against them now Trump is</text>
  <text start="531.12" dur="5.43">out there and he is going after Powell</text>
  <text start="534.63" dur="3.9">now I do believe Powell is working with</text>
  <text start="536.55" dur="3.63">him and Trump said in no uncertain terms</text>
  <text start="538.53" dur="4.02">that he was intentionally sending a</text>
  <text start="540.18" dur="4.35">direct message to mr. Powell that he</text>
  <text start="542.55" dur="4.23">wanted lower interest rates now remember</text>
  <text start="544.53" dur="4.94">we gotta go back in time Trump said that</text>
  <text start="546.78" dur="5.19">he thought that Powell was an easy money</text>
  <text start="549.47" dur="3.01">person who he was putting into this</text>
  <text start="551.97" dur="3.18">position</text>
  <text start="552.48" dur="6.09">he knew damn well that he was not easy</text>
  <text start="555.15" dur="4.77">money he knew what the plan was that he</text>
  <text start="558.57" dur="2.45">was going to go in there and raise</text>
  <text start="559.92" dur="3.27">interest rates</text>
  <text start="561.02" dur="5.65">Trump&amp;#39;s been in business for a very long</text>
  <text start="563.19" dur="6.75">time everyone knows that when you raise</text>
  <text start="566.67" dur="4.65">the interest rates in a dead economy it</text>
  <text start="569.94" dur="2.73">pushes people out of the housing market</text>
  <text start="571.32" dur="3.69">pushes people out of the automobile</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="4.98">market people have a difficult time</text>
  <text start="575.01" dur="5.46">getting student loans credit card debt</text>
  <text start="577.65" dur="6.66">Rises very very quickly you have to pay</text>
  <text start="580.47" dur="5.82">the debt on the government loans and if</text>
  <text start="584.31" dur="2.56">the interest rate moves up well there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.29" dur="3.91">more in</text>
  <text start="586.87" dur="5.82">on that I mean everyone knows this he</text>
  <text start="590.2" dur="6.78">did this on purpose this was to bring</text>
  <text start="592.69" dur="7.44">down the entire system and he&amp;#39;s setting</text>
  <text start="596.98" dur="4.47">up the Fed right now he went on to say</text>
  <text start="600.13" dur="4.5">that the Fed is supposed to be</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="5.7">independent in theory and he suggested</text>
  <text start="604.63" dur="7.77">that he wouldn&amp;#39;t keep quiet and let the</text>
  <text start="607.15" dur="7.77">central bank wreck the economy whoa did</text>
  <text start="612.4" dur="7.29">he just tell us what he&amp;#39;s planning to do</text>
  <text start="614.92" dur="7.23">yes he did he&amp;#39;s telling everyone and</text>
  <text start="619.69" dur="6">he&amp;#39;s projecting it out there for the</text>
  <text start="622.15" dur="7.53">future that it was the central bank the</text>
  <text start="625.69" dur="10.26">Fed that wrecked the economy he just set</text>
  <text start="629.68" dur="9.6">the narrative up so as we see this</text>
  <text start="635.95" dur="5.97">economy deteriorate and decline very</text>
  <text start="639.28" dur="6.09">very rapidly Trump is gonna come out and</text>
  <text start="641.92" dur="5.52">blame the fent blame the Fed and he went</text>
  <text start="645.37" dur="3.68">on to say every time we do something</text>
  <text start="647.44" dur="5.7">great</text>
  <text start="649.05" dur="7.45">Powell raises the interest rates it</text>
  <text start="653.14" dur="5.4">almost looks like he&amp;#39;s happy when he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="656.5" dur="4.35">raising the interest rates yeah he is</text>
  <text start="658.54" dur="3.63">because this is a part of the plan they</text>
  <text start="660.85" dur="5.4">know that this is going to bring down</text>
  <text start="662.17" dur="6.81">the entire system and the president</text>
  <text start="666.25" dur="6.24">declined to elaborate on what he just</text>
  <text start="668.98" dur="7.26">said which means they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="672.49" dur="6.69">together he just set up the narrative he</text>
  <text start="676.24" dur="5.94">just told the entire world who is going</text>
  <text start="679.18" dur="5.13">to be responsible for the economy coming</text>
  <text start="682.18" dur="5.03">down who we&amp;#39;re going to have to audit</text>
  <text start="684.31" dur="6.57">who we&amp;#39;re gonna have to nationalize and</text>
  <text start="687.21" dur="6.73">who we&amp;#39;re going to have to expose so at</text>
  <text start="690.88" dur="5.46">this time we can see that the narrative</text>
  <text start="693.94" dur="3.81">is being set up now the central bank and</text>
  <text start="696.34" dur="3.51">all those other players remember there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="697.75" dur="3.21">good guys bad guys within the Federal</text>
  <text start="699.85" dur="2.37">Reserve with in all the different</text>
  <text start="700.96" dur="3.45">central banks around the world and this</text>
  <text start="702.22" dur="4.14">is why the IMF is very worried the</text>
  <text start="704.41" dur="3.66">business very worried the deep state</text>
  <text start="706.36" dur="3.51">players they are very worried and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="708.07" dur="4.5">get into that in the next report but</text>
  <text start="709.87" dur="4.53">they are scrambling right now because</text>
  <text start="712.57" dur="4.41">the plan is not just to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="714.4" dur="4.95">deep state the plan encompasses much</text>
  <text start="716.98" dur="3.24">much more of that because if you just</text>
