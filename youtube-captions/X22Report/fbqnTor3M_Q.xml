  <text start="36.579" dur="6.841">probability of the first part of the</text>
  <text start="39.01" dur="6.6">collapse in the fall and I will discuss</text>
  <text start="43.42" dur="4.65">why I believe that this is going to</text>
  <text start="45.61" dur="5.19">happen and what&amp;#39;s going to happen and we</text>
  <text start="48.07" dur="5.19">see the markets have finished and a</text>
  <text start="50.8" dur="6.63">positive note gold and silver have been</text>
  <text start="53.26" dur="7.95">pushed down a little bit and let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="57.43" dur="8.82">into the economic collapse news in</text>
  <text start="61.21" dur="8.79">Cyprus let&amp;#39;s go back to Cyprus what the</text>
  <text start="66.25" dur="10.31">central bankers and what they always</text>
  <text start="70" dur="11.31">want is hard assets and the goal of</text>
  <text start="76.56" dur="7.989">basically bringing down a country is to</text>
  <text start="81.31" dur="7.559">get those hard assets natural resources</text>
  <text start="84.549" dur="8.011">gold silver and oil natural gas things</text>
  <text start="88.869" dur="6.301">like that copper lithium because they</text>
  <text start="92.56" dur="5.76">are printing money and this money is</text>
  <text start="95.17" dur="6.15">paper it&amp;#39;s really worth nothing they</text>
  <text start="98.32" dur="4.829">know it they want all the things that</text>
  <text start="101.32" dur="5.07">are worth something so when something</text>
  <text start="103.149" dur="6.871">collapses and the paper value plummets</text>
  <text start="106.39" dur="6.6">to nothing they have real hard assets</text>
  <text start="110.02" dur="6.84">the people are left with paper so in</text>
  <text start="112.99" dur="7.71">Cyprus right now they really want the</text>
  <text start="116.86" dur="6.719">gold that Cyprus has plus all their</text>
  <text start="120.7" dur="5.64">deposits of any type of natural</text>
  <text start="123.579" dur="4.65">resources and right now Cyprus is</text>
  <text start="126.34" dur="5.61">resisting pressure from the European</text>
  <text start="128.229" dur="6.211">Commission and the IMF to sell its gold</text>
  <text start="131.95" dur="3.93">reserves for the bailout and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="134.44" dur="3.69">looking at alternatives</text>
  <text start="135.88" dur="5.01">and cypress is trying to come up with</text>
  <text start="138.13" dur="4.68">different ways to hold this off and not</text>
  <text start="140.89" dur="6.63">sell their gold and Cyprus has around</text>
  <text start="142.81" dur="8.4">13.9 tons of gold which is 447,000 troy</text>
  <text start="147.52" dur="6.33">ounces and they want this and right now</text>
  <text start="151.21" dur="6.57">Cyprus is resisting and this is what all</text>
  <text start="153.85" dur="6.6">these bail-ins bailouts the the theft of</text>
  <text start="157.78" dur="7.16">the people&amp;#39;s wealth this is what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.45" dur="8.07">all about it&amp;#39;s all about getting the</text>
  <text start="164.94" dur="5.44">hard assets from the countries from the</text>
  <text start="168.52" dur="4.08">people because when they know the</text>
  <text start="170.38" dur="5.16">economic collapse is coming and they</text>
  <text start="172.6" dur="5.49">know the paper is going to 0 this is</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="4.67">what they need to have and people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="5.34">really understand this anymore and</text>
  <text start="180.21" dur="7.26">yesterday when I said you know people in</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="8.33">other countries in other areas and in</text>
  <text start="187.47" dur="10.33">they know that gold silver platinum</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="8.83">copper oil natural gas lithium all these</text>
  <text start="197.8" dur="5.36">different real estate land all these</text>
  <text start="200.59" dur="5.19">things are worth something in the end</text>
  <text start="203.16" dur="6.04">the only thing that won&amp;#39;t be worth</text>
  <text start="205.78" dur="5.94">something is the paper or the electronic</text>
  <text start="209.2" dur="7.8">money that you think you have in the</text>
  <text start="211.72" dur="9.6">bank now in the news today you know</text>
  <text start="217" dur="6.87">Bernanke came out and he told everyone</text>
  <text start="221.32" dur="5.91">what he was going to do and which was</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="5.52">nothing really it&amp;#39;s more of the Fed</text>
  <text start="227.23" dur="6.81">babble that he always spews out of his</text>
  <text start="229.39" dur="9.63">mouth and what I found interesting there</text>
  <text start="234.04" dur="8.31">was a an article in The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="239.02" dur="5.99">Journal and I see now that the</text>
  <text start="242.35" dur="6.54">mainstream media is starting to pick up</text>
  <text start="245.01" dur="6.13">of what&amp;#39;s really happening and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.89" dur="4.29">starting to report on this it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="251.14" dur="4.26">because when I look back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="253.18" dur="4.619">eight I saw the same thing starting to</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="5.28">happen where the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="5.461">started to talk about the housing is in</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="4.86">a bubble it was always really at the</text>
  <text start="263.26" dur="4.68">last moment when they started to talk</text>
  <text start="265.54" dur="4.29">about this because the housing market</text>
  <text start="267.94" dur="3.87">was reaching its height than they</text>
  <text start="269.83" dur="5.55">started talking about the stock market</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="5.88">and you saw a couple of articles come</text>
  <text start="275.38" dur="7.38">out about this and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="277.69" dur="9.35">this now again and this goes on to say a</text>
  <text start="282.76" dur="7.02">jobless recovery is a phony recovery and</text>
  <text start="287.04" dur="6.4">there let me just read a little bit of</text>
  <text start="289.78" dur="6.12">this to you in recent months Americans</text>
  <text start="293.44" dur="5.13">have heard reports out of Washington and</text>
  <text start="295.9" dur="5.04">in the media that the economy is looking</text>

  <text start="334.63" dur="5.51">unemployment calculations that garner</text>
  <text start="336.67" dur="7.95">headlines I find this absolutely</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="8.41">fascinating because myself and many</text>

  <text start="365.08" dur="6.54">other old alternate alternative media</text>
  <text start="368.26" dur="4.32">outlets or other type of channels that</text>
  <text start="371.62" dur="3.24">are not controlled by the mainstream</text>
  <text start="372.58" dur="4.65">media have been saying this for how long</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="4.44">now and now all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="377.23" dur="4.14">mainstream media is coming out with it</text>
  <text start="379.3" dur="6.2">just like they came out with the NSA</text>
  <text start="381.37" dur="8.82">spying they&amp;#39;re always behind and always</text>
  <text start="385.5" dur="7.84">years late on what the news really is</text>
  <text start="390.19" dur="5.31">but it goes on to say even the federal</text>
  <text start="393.34" dur="6">government payroll is turning two</text>
  <text start="395.5" dur="6.3">part-timers in June 2012 58,000 federal</text>
  <text start="399.34" dur="4.74">workers were part-timers this year it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="3.57">a hundred and forty eight thousand</text>
  <text start="404.08" dur="2.94">we still don&amp;#39;t know how the budget</text>
  <text start="405.37" dur="3.569">sequester will play out for many</text>
  <text start="407.02" dur="5.94">agencies have resorted to furloughs</text>
  <text start="408.939" dur="8.07">rather than layoffs and they are right i</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="6.72">mean a it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a complete illusion</text>
  <text start="417.009" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s a manipulation of the calculation</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="8.43">it&amp;#39;s a manipulation of all statistical</text>
  <text start="422.889" dur="7.321">numbers and really again if people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="428.11" dur="5.489">have jobs what does that really mean</text>
  <text start="430.21" dur="12.169">when we think about when people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="433.599" dur="8.78">work well retail stores and retail sales</text>
  <text start="442.8" dur="9.04">don&amp;#39;t do very well they are retail does</text>
  <text start="448.509" dur="7.28">not expand it contracts and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="451.84" dur="8.579">that all these retail stores that a</text>
  <text start="455.789" dur="7.361">couple episodes back they were they all</text>
  <text start="460.419" dur="5.191">added up to a thousand plus a couple</text>
  <text start="463.15" dur="6.359">thousand plus stores that are closing</text>
  <text start="465.61" dur="6.48">for the the main retail chains so we see</text>
  <text start="469.509" dur="5.041">that happening what else happens we</text>
  <text start="472.09" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t see main corporations or</text>
  <text start="474.55" dur="5.07">businesses expanding we don&amp;#39;t see small</text>
  <text start="476.74" dur="6.12">businesses expanding we don&amp;#39;t see any of</text>
  <text start="479.62" dur="5.639">this happening when people don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="482.86" dur="6.359">jobs they have less disposable income</text>
  <text start="485.259" dur="6.421">and this is why we don&amp;#39;t see the the</text>
  <text start="489.219" dur="6.87">purchasing of big-ticket items we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="491.68" dur="8.01">see retail sales going up we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="496.089" dur="6.36">anything like this happening we see the</text>
  <text start="499.69" dur="6.689">actual opposite of all this happening</text>
  <text start="502.449" dur="7.381">and this is how we put all this together</text>
  <text start="506.379" dur="6.511">and we say well how great can the job</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="5.999">market be if everything is contracting</text>
  <text start="512.89" dur="4.439">it makes no sense now it makes sense to</text>
  <text start="515.829" dur="4.5">us because you know we&amp;#39;re paying</text>
  <text start="517.329" dur="6.39">attention it wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense for the</text>
  <text start="520.329" dur="5.88">Fed unless they changed the calculation</text>
  <text start="523.719" dur="4.411">and manipulated numbers that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="526.209" dur="4.471">what happens but again they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="528.13" dur="7.22">you&amp;#39;re looking at that all eyes on the</text>
  <text start="530.68" dur="4.67">stock market okay</text>
  <text start="536.06" dur="8.07">now speaking of the housing recovery the</text>
  <text start="540.26" dur="8.43">the housing starts miss most since</text>
  <text start="544.13" dur="8.34">January 2007 permits have biggest miss</text>
  <text start="548.69" dur="6.839">in history and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="552.47" dur="7.26">this a lot the housing momentum is</text>
  <text start="555.529" dur="7.201">starting to slow and a couple episodes</text>
  <text start="559.73" dur="6.42">back we talked about how the mortgage</text>
  <text start="562.73" dur="6.54">applications were down and the mortgage</text>
  <text start="566.15" dur="6.57">applications are down even more they are</text>
  <text start="569.27" dur="6.319">forty five percent down more mordric</text>
  <text start="572.72" dur="7.8">mortgage applications or back to the</text>
  <text start="575.589" dur="8.051">2011 lows and as the mortgage</text>
  <text start="580.52" dur="5.25">applications people are not applying for</text>
  <text start="583.64" dur="4.8">mortgages they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="585.77" dur="4.98">anything and it always lags behind the</text>
  <text start="588.44" dur="5.91">sales and eventually what we&amp;#39;ll see is</text>
  <text start="590.75" dur="6.029">the sale start to decline these hedge</text>
  <text start="594.35" dur="4.38">funds and other investors that were</text>
  <text start="596.779" dur="3.961">buying up the homes they are trying to</text>
  <text start="598.73" dur="5.04">get out of them right now they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="600.74" dur="6.66">want them and since the job market is an</text>
  <text start="603.77" dur="7.819">illusion Americans right now do not have</text>
  <text start="607.4" dur="8.28">the resources to purchase these type of</text>
  <text start="611.589" dur="7.121">huge ticket items because again we have</text>
  <text start="615.68" dur="5.37">to use common sense here if the housing</text>
  <text start="618.71" dur="6.39">market is so great and it&amp;#39;s recovering</text>
  <text start="621.05" dur="9.72">why is the Fed still purchasing all of</text>
  <text start="625.1" dur="9.06">this toxic real estate every single</text>
  <text start="630.77" dur="6.78">month for 40 to 45 billion dollars it</text>
  <text start="634.16" dur="6.35">makes no sense if the real estate market</text>
  <text start="637.55" dur="5.76">is going up why do they have to do that</text>
  <text start="640.51" dur="5.47">the bank&amp;#39;s you know should wait until</text>
  <text start="643.31" dur="4.98">the housing market as they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="645.98" dur="4.35">has been moving up they should sell</text>
  <text start="648.29" dur="4.47">their homes but they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="650.33" dur="4.47">because it&amp;#39;s easier for the Fed just to</text>
  <text start="652.76" dur="4.5">come in and purchase it the Fed knows</text>
  <text start="654.8" dur="4.83">that this is completely fake they try to</text>
  <text start="657.26" dur="9.98">get people into the market it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="659.63" dur="7.61">work and it&amp;#39;s not working now</text>

  <text start="1020.61" dur="7.17">house and buy a bigger more expensive</text>
  <text start="1022.77" dur="9.27">house because they believe what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1027.78" dur="7.26">saying and this is what happened in 2008</text>
  <text start="1032.04" dur="4.95">now right now if we look back in two</text>
  <text start="1035.04" dur="6.32">thousand eight we saw a mortgage</text>

  <text start="1041.36" dur="7.09">we&amp;#39;re still strong because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1044.58" dur="5.58">little bit of a lag time and we can see</text>
  <text start="1048.45" dur="5.94">that other people who are not paying</text>
  <text start="1050.16" dur="7.83">attention do not see this so something</text>
  <text start="1054.39" dur="8">is going to happen this fall this is why</text>
  <text start="1057.99" dur="7.23">they want everyone in at this time</text>
  <text start="1062.39" dur="7.27">because they are going to bring this</text>
  <text start="1065.22" dur="7.14">down or they know of something that will</text>
  <text start="1069.66" dur="4.92">bring this down could be the Treasury</text>
  <text start="1072.36" dur="5.04">bond market could be interest rates</text>
  <text start="1074.58" dur="6.33">going up could be Japan it could be many</text>
  <text start="1077.4" dur="6.45">many factors that this will be coming</text>
  <text start="1080.91" dur="6.42">this will be tumbling down it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1083.85" dur="6.51">like when Goldman came out and told</text>
  <text start="1087.33" dur="6.69">everyone there bearish on gold and the</text>
  <text start="1090.36" dur="7.71">next day or so gold was smacked down 200</text>
  <text start="1094.02" dur="7.98">plus dollars now we could have all sold</text>
  <text start="1098.07" dur="6.93">our physical gold but since we know</text>
  <text start="1102" dur="5.61">what&amp;#39;s going on and we see physical gold</text>
  <text start="1105" dur="9.47">is getting harder and harder to find we</text>
  <text start="1107.61" dur="11.76">realized that the physical market is</text>
  <text start="1114.47" dur="8.29">really not affected by this and that</text>
  <text start="1119.37" dur="6.81">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is smack down</text>
  <text start="1122.76" dur="7.77">the gold so they can acquire gold and</text>
  <text start="1126.18" dur="7.14">get rid of their paper crap now those</text>
  <text start="1130.53" dur="4.44">people who are sleeping said ho gold is</text>
  <text start="1133.32" dur="3.75">in a bubble we better sell and they</text>
  <text start="1134.97" dur="4.86">probably sold at the the lowest you know</text>
  <text start="1137.07" dur="4.26">amount and they all got out and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1139.83" dur="3.66">been trying you know the central banks</text>
  <text start="1141.33" dur="4.53">and the Fed and the the government and</text>
  <text start="1143.49" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to push everyone out</text>
  <text start="1145.86" dur="7.68">of gold because that&amp;#39;s what they want</text>
  <text start="1149.16" dur="8.28">they want the gold so we see this and</text>
  <text start="1153.54" dur="6.18">something is coming something is going</text>
  <text start="1157.44" dur="4.65">to happen in the fall because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1159.72" dur="6.42">always the opposite they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="1162.09" dur="10.44">everyone everything is okay it is always</text>
  <text start="1166.14" dur="9.15">the opposite and then went on to say and</text>
  <text start="1172.53" dur="5.37">I think these are very funny quotes Wall</text>
  <text start="1175.29" dur="7.83">Street hasn&amp;#39;t benefited more than Main</text>
  <text start="1177.9" dur="7.35">Street really and says fed very focused</text>
  <text start="1183.12" dur="4.2">on Main Street anyone out there see that</text>
  <text start="1185.25" dur="8.1">that they&amp;#39;re really focused on the</text>
  <text start="1187.32" dur="9.63">people yeah I see it and there was a</text>
  <text start="1193.35" dur="4.919">question asked to Ben are you printing</text>
  <text start="1196.95" dur="5.75">money</text>
  <text start="1198.269" dur="6.75">he said not literally I mean just and</text>
  <text start="1202.7" dur="4.209">there was a follow-up question to that</text>
  <text start="1205.019" dur="9.801">if the Fed were to tighten policy the</text>
  <text start="1206.909" dur="12.96">economy would tank and this is just</text>
  <text start="1214.82" dur="7.959">unbelievable what I mean if you really</text>
  <text start="1219.869" dur="5.97">listen to what is said and what is</text>
  <text start="1222.779" dur="5.97">saying he doesn&amp;#39;t care about Main Street</text>
  <text start="1225.839" dur="7.53">he doesn&amp;#39;t care about the people because</text>
  <text start="1228.749" dur="6.451">the Fed is not part of the government</text>
  <text start="1233.369" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s not part of the people it&amp;#39;s a</text>
