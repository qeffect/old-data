  <text start="55.18" dur="5.46">x22 report by name is dave in this</text>
  <text start="57.13" dur="6.42">episode 1455 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="60.64" dur="5.04">December 22nd 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="63.55" dur="3.87">the episode is the central banks moved</text>
  <text start="65.68" dur="5.04">their plan forward be prepared and</text>
  <text start="67.42" dur="5.88">cautious let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="70.72" dur="5.43">collapse financial news now we have been</text>
  <text start="73.3" dur="4.29">watching the crypto market and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="76.15" dur="4.5">been talking about it had the interview</text>
  <text start="77.59" dur="5.7">with Jeff Nielsen I discussed it in my</text>
  <text start="80.65" dur="6.03">other report and all of a sudden we saw</text>
  <text start="83.29" dur="5.88">a Bitcoin take a drop do I think this is</text>
  <text start="86.68" dur="4.469">the big drop no not yet</text>
  <text start="89.17" dur="4.92">I mean it took a drop and it bounced</text>
  <text start="91.149" dur="5.371">back a little bit what a more concerned</text>
  <text start="94.09" dur="6.93">about is this is how the central bankers</text>
  <text start="96.52" dur="6.599">work they pump things up by using free</text>
  <text start="101.02" dur="4.95">money just like the stock market the</text>
  <text start="103.119" dur="4.441">housing market sometimes they let it</text>
  <text start="105.97" dur="4.53">drop a little bit and then pop it up</text>
  <text start="107.56" dur="5.55">again because when people see this they</text>
  <text start="110.5" dur="5.31">think oh okay everything is still okay</text>
  <text start="113.11" dur="5.369">let me get get in and then those people</text>
  <text start="115.81" dur="5.669">that were hesitant who see it drop and</text>
  <text start="118.479" dur="5.371">then it goes back up they say oh look</text>
  <text start="121.479" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s really stable it&amp;#39;s going up again I</text>
  <text start="123.85" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t have to fear anything let me get</text>
  <text start="126.009" dur="5.521">into the market and I think this is what</text>
  <text start="128.38" dur="4.829">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and from</text>
  <text start="131.53" dur="2.73">everything that I&amp;#39;ve been studying and</text>
  <text start="133.209" dur="4.471">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="134.26" dur="6.36">the central bank&amp;#39;s love to create</text>
  <text start="137.68" dur="5.85">bubbles they love to do this and they</text>
  <text start="140.62" dur="5.16">use them in all different ways to push</text>
  <text start="143.53" dur="3.27">their agenda and I could see how they</text>
  <text start="145.78" dur="3.66">could push their agenda using</text>
  <text start="146.8" dur="5.73">cryptocurrency where they can pump it up</text>
  <text start="149.44" dur="5.909">and then dump it where they sell masses</text>
  <text start="152.53" dur="4.59">massive amount of cryptocurrencies just</text>
  <text start="155.349" dur="3.691">like they do with the gold and silver</text>
  <text start="157.12" dur="4.38">contracts and and we also have to</text>
  <text start="159.04" dur="4.47">understand that they started the futures</text>
  <text start="161.5" dur="6.06">market which they&amp;#39;re going to try to use</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="5.61">to control Bitcoin and most likely it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.56" dur="3.66">you know smash it down</text>
  <text start="169.12" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s that would be their plan they</text>
  <text start="171.22" dur="3.75">want to show that it&amp;#39;s volatile they</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="5.089">want to show people that you shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="174.97" dur="8.219">be getting into this now gold and silver</text>
  <text start="178.319" dur="7.191">this is a store of wealth this has</text>
  <text start="183.189" dur="5.681">worked for thousands of years</text>
  <text start="185.51" dur="8.339">it worked in this system until the</text>
  <text start="188.87" dur="8.94">central bank&amp;#39;s got laws passed and the</text>
  <text start="193.849" dur="6.36">government in our country and across the</text>
  <text start="197.81" dur="6.12">globe different governments allowed</text>
  <text start="200.209" dur="7.11">central banks to take control and to</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="5.779">start creating their currency out of</text>
  <text start="207.319" dur="5.461">thin air with interest attached to it</text>
  <text start="209.709" dur="7.12">cryptocurrency I do believe would be a</text>
  <text start="212.78" dur="6.929">fantastic currency because it is</text>
  <text start="216.829" dur="3.69">decentralized because there is no</text>
  <text start="219.709" dur="4.051">central bank</text>
  <text start="220.519" dur="7.821">you don&amp;#39;t need banks everything is</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="7.259">accounted for but if the central banks</text>
  <text start="228.34" dur="6.959">push their agenda like I see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="231.019" dur="6.901">doing right now where they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="235.299" dur="4.571">take hold of the crypto market because</text>
  <text start="237.92" dur="5.37">they finally see something where they</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="7.259">can say we can completely get away from</text>
  <text start="243.29" dur="5.46">cash all at once we don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="247.129" dur="3.36">the dollar we know the dollar is doomed</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="3.959">we know the euro is not gonna go</text>
  <text start="250.489" dur="4.411">anywhere we see that crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="252.709" dur="3.691">this is perfect because there was never</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="4.1">cash in the first place</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="7.199">so we don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it and</text>
  <text start="259" dur="7.449">once again if they are able to if</text>
  <text start="263.599" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re able to convince those in the</text>
  <text start="266.449" dur="5.671">government that crypto currencies and</text>
  <text start="270.169" dur="4.201">I&amp;#39;m just gonna use the word evil if</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re evil the ones that are out there</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="5.91">Bitcoin or like coin or - or any of them</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="4.71">and they need and we need and this is</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="4.199">what they do they make it look like</text>
  <text start="281.99" dur="6.27">these are volatile these are unsafe we</text>
  <text start="284.479" dur="6.091">need something that is stable they will</text>
  <text start="288.26" dur="4.02">introduce the Fed coin which I do</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="3.77">believe they&amp;#39;re already they already</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="4.53">have and it&amp;#39;s waiting in the wings and</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="5.259">we can see that they&amp;#39;re moving in this</text>
  <text start="296.81" dur="5.729">direction and this is why I&amp;#39;m saying be</text>
  <text start="299.599" dur="4.261">prepared and cautious with this because</text>
  <text start="302.539" dur="3.571">we can see what has been happening</text>
  <text start="303.86" dur="5.97">lately and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="5.46">all this is that goldman sachs and this</text>
  <text start="309.83" dur="4.05">is something that we need to understand</text>
  <text start="311.57" dur="4.17">and recognize because all these banking</text>
  <text start="313.88" dur="3.24">systems are arms of the central bank</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="1.85">they work with the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.12" dur="3.11">members</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="5.37">bored of the central bank&amp;#39;s and they</text>
  <text start="320.23" dur="5.4">like having the central banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="322.96" dur="7.34">preparing to launch a crypto currency</text>
  <text start="325.63" dur="6.9">trading desk and we understand that</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re not doing this in the best</text>
  <text start="332.53" dur="7.17">interest of the people you know for</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="7.39">investments for the people they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="339.7" dur="8.55">it to corner the market control the</text>
  <text start="344.47" dur="5.97">market and maybe uh sure in the Fed coin</text>
  <text start="348.25" dur="5.01">and we can see that we&amp;#39;re heading down</text>
  <text start="350.44" dur="4.59">this path where it looks like they might</text>
  <text start="353.26" dur="5.28">be pushing their agenda now the central</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="5.91">banks they understand that the dollar is</text>
  <text start="358.54" dur="4.92">doomed and they know that people are</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="3.84">gonna need something to trade with and</text>
  <text start="363.46" dur="3.69">it would be great if there was something</text>
  <text start="364.78" dur="4.68">that didn&amp;#39;t involve cash crypto</text>
  <text start="367.15" dur="3.93">currencies looks like this could be it</text>
  <text start="369.46" dur="4.89">now the people are going to have to</text>
  <text start="371.08" dur="4.89">fight against this because they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="374.35" dur="4.29">make it look like and they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="375.97" dur="6">to push their agenda by convincing</text>
  <text start="378.64" dur="4.89">government that crypto currency is awful</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="3.33">and of course they&amp;#39;re gonna come out and</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="3.84">reports telling you how many people lost</text>
  <text start="385.3" dur="4.14">money once they crash it they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="387.37" dur="3.45">tell you how bad it was and this is why</text>
  <text start="389.44" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s unsafe this is why you need the</text>
  <text start="390.82" dur="5.25">central banking system this is why they</text>
  <text start="393.34" dur="4.92">need to control it this is why they need</text>
  <text start="396.07" dur="4.32">to stabilize it this is why we already</text>
  <text start="398.26" dur="5.31">have laws written up all we need is</text>
  <text start="400.39" dur="7.74">government to pass them that gives the</text>
  <text start="403.57" dur="6.75">central bank&amp;#39;s the sole ownership of the</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="4.41">crypto currency that will be used here</text>
  <text start="410.32" dur="4.8">in the United States and around the</text>
  <text start="412.54" dur="4.44">world on a low level and they might use</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="3.96">something else on a higher level and</text>
  <text start="416.98" dur="4.64">this is what we&amp;#39;re watching right now</text>
  <text start="419.08" dur="7.56">and we can see that this could be a play</text>
  <text start="421.62" dur="7.57">to actually have this done so this is</text>
  <text start="426.64" dur="4.32">why I&amp;#39;m saying be prepared and cautious</text>
  <text start="429.19" dur="4.23">you could still be in the market I mean</text>
  <text start="430.96" dur="4.41">I wouldn&amp;#39;t mortgage your house or take</text>
  <text start="433.42" dur="4.05">out credit cards and go into the Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="435.37" dur="4.95">market or any other crypto currency</text>
  <text start="437.47" dur="5.22">market that&amp;#39;d be ridiculous being in the</text>
  <text start="440.32" dur="5.19">market is fine is my personal opinion</text>
  <text start="442.69" dur="6.63">you can use the crypto markets we can</text>
  <text start="445.51" dur="5.69">get some profits out of it use it maybe</text>
  <text start="449.32" dur="4.01">buy gold and silver or just take the</text>
  <text start="451.2" dur="4.8">fits you can do that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="4.05">fantastic but I wouldn&amp;#39;t go all in</text>
  <text start="456" dur="2.97">some people go like just like in the</text>
  <text start="457.38" dur="3.45">stock market people see going up and</text>
  <text start="458.97" dur="3.3">they go all in and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="460.83" dur="3.21">everything is lost and you know they</text>
  <text start="462.27" dur="3.3">have nothing left we&amp;#39;ve seen this happen</text>
  <text start="464.04" dur="4.71">in the past you don&amp;#39;t want to do this</text>
  <text start="465.57" dur="4.92">because you want to be diversified you</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="6.72">want to be prepared for anything that</text>
  <text start="470.49" dur="8.52">could happen now out in Canada we see</text>
  <text start="475.47" dur="4.98">the housing affordability hits a 27 year</text>
  <text start="479.01" dur="4.77">low and it looks like the everyday</text>
  <text start="480.45" dur="6.06">person they just can&amp;#39;t afford the homes</text>
  <text start="483.78" dur="5.49">now houses are starting to fall but it</text>
  <text start="486.51" dur="4.86">has come it&amp;#39;s completely out of the</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="4.32">reach of the everyday person now the</text>
  <text start="491.37" dur="4.35">percent of income the median family</text>
  <text start="493.59" dur="4.97">would have to use to service that pushes</text>
  <text start="495.72" dur="5.88">above 50% in Toronto and Vancouver</text>
  <text start="498.56" dur="5.74">currently Toronto is at 70 1.7 percent</text>
  <text start="501.6" dur="5.97">and Vancouver is at 79 point 8 percent</text>
  <text start="504.3" dur="6.12">and people they just can&amp;#39;t afford homes</text>
  <text start="507.57" dur="5.909">this is a telltale sign that the housing</text>
  <text start="510.42" dur="4.38">market is in a bubble we see here in the</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="4.191">United States the humid consumer</text>
  <text start="514.8" dur="5.07">confidence it is decline right now</text>
  <text start="517.67" dur="3.82">people are looking at the situation</text>
  <text start="519.87" dur="4.68">saying that you know we&amp;#39;re not very</text>
  <text start="521.49" dur="4.83">confident in what is going on and we</text>
  <text start="524.55" dur="4.86">mentioned this yesterday or the day</text>
  <text start="526.32" dur="5.73">before where the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="529.41" dur="3.99">there saying wow retail sales people</text>
  <text start="532.05" dur="3.42">while they actually did say retail sales</text>
  <text start="533.4" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re saying spending is at an</text>
  <text start="535.47" dur="5.28">all-time high where people are using</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="5.82">debt and we said that savings while</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="5.97">savings savings have been declining and</text>
  <text start="543.3" dur="8.25">if we take a closer look we see that the</text>
  <text start="546.72" dur="6.57">US consumer is completely tapped out the</text>
  <text start="551.55" dur="4.29">Department of Commerce reported that in</text>
  <text start="553.29" dur="5.64">November personal income rose by lower</text>
  <text start="555.84" dur="9.15">than expected point three percent and US</text>
  <text start="558.93" dur="10.92">consumers well their savings rate right</text>
  <text start="564.99" dur="6.78">now is continually declining and in the</text>
  <text start="569.85" dur="3.81">latest month it tumbled a three point</text>
  <text start="571.77" dur="7.77">two percent to two point nine percent</text>
  <text start="573.66" dur="7.71">the lowest since 2007 which as a</text>
  <text start="579.54" dur="3.99">reminder is one month before the</text>
  <text start="581.37" dur="3.65">recession started so when you look at</text>
  <text start="583.53" dur="5.16">this we see since</text>
  <text start="585.02" dur="6.46">2013 the savings rate continually</text>
  <text start="588.69" dur="5.45">declines and we&amp;#39;ve reached the point of</text>
  <text start="591.48" dur="5.88">like I said where we&amp;#39;re back to 2007</text>
  <text start="594.14" dur="5.23">which tells you that people need to use</text>
  <text start="597.36" dur="5.58">their credit cards because they have</text>
  <text start="599.37" dur="7.22">nothing saved and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="602.94" dur="7.65">credit cards we see they have shot up in</text>
  <text start="606.59" dur="6.52">the late the beginning parts of 2017</text>
  <text start="610.59" dur="5.07">going into 2017 and people are using</text>
  <text start="613.11" dur="5.13">more and more of their credit cards like</text>
  <text start="615.66" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before and this tells</text>
  <text start="618.24" dur="4.98">us something this tells us that people</text>
  <text start="620.85" dur="5.43">they just don&amp;#39;t have the funds we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="623.22" dur="5.4">seeing retail shut down people being</text>
  <text start="626.28" dur="5.36">laid off we see subway right now is</text>
  <text start="628.62" dur="6.57">closing nine hundred and nine stores in</text>
  <text start="631.64" dur="5.61">2017 this is the beginning of a crisis</text>
  <text start="635.19" dur="4.47">because when we look at it we see that</text>
  <text start="637.25" dur="3.91">you know the restaurant chain was</text>
  <text start="639.66" dur="3.27">supposed to be doing fantastic everyone</text>
  <text start="641.16" dur="6.05">was getting hired there&amp;#39;s more and more</text>
  <text start="642.93" dur="9.57">waiters and waitresses but we see huge</text>
  <text start="647.21" dur="7.81">restaurant chains shutting down and this</text>
  <text start="652.5" dur="3.96">does not look good and this is at an</text>
  <text start="655.02" dur="4.65">affordable price where people can go in</text>
  <text start="656.46" dur="5.76">and buy a sandwich so already we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="659.67" dur="4.83">seeing something is wrong here we see</text>
  <text start="662.22" dur="5.34">durable goods orders they stumbled in</text>
  <text start="664.5" dur="3.9">November you remove aircrafts and parts</text>
  <text start="667.56" dur="3.06">and things like that</text>
  <text start="668.4" dur="4.08">it looks like durable goods really is</text>
  <text start="670.62" dur="3.69">not doing well whatsoever and that is</text>
  <text start="672.48" dur="3.45">like washer dryers the big-ticket items</text>
  <text start="674.31" dur="3.3">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="675.93" dur="3.57">everything&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="677.61" dur="3.87">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
