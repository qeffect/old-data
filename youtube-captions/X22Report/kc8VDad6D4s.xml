  <text start="120.009" dur="5.82">think this is not just about getting rid</text>
  <text start="123.64" dur="5.28">of the deep state arresting a few</text>
  <text start="125.829" dur="5.541">individuals if you look at this plan it</text>
  <text start="128.92" dur="5.52">encompasses everything it encompasses</text>
  <text start="131.37" dur="6.85">the deep state it includes</text>

  <text start="169.159" dur="9.841">that country or the world and we are</text>
  <text start="174.42" dur="9.06">seeing a complete and utter breakdown of</text>
  <text start="179" dur="8.14">the central banking system the plan is</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="5.94">to bring this central bank system which</text>
  <text start="187.14" dur="5.189">is not really that hard to do because</text>
  <text start="189.42" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s designed to implode on itself this</text>
  <text start="192.329" dur="4.74">is why they need a major event this is</text>
  <text start="194.64" dur="6.269">why they need something is to bring the</text>
  <text start="197.069" dur="6.78">central bank to its knees by doing what</text>
  <text start="200.909" dur="5.791">they&amp;#39;ve always done in the past except</text>
  <text start="203.849" dur="4.89">just turn up the dial turn up the volume</text>
  <text start="206.7" dur="5.67">and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="208.739" dur="6.211">and we can see that the central bankers</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re always going to try to stay in</text>
  <text start="214.95" dur="4.14">control they never want to give up</text>
  <text start="216.45" dur="4.2">control I mean perfect example is the</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="4.229">brexit and people are starting to</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="5.6">realize that this deal is absolutely</text>
  <text start="223.319" dur="6.861">awful and it is not good for the people</text>
  <text start="226.25" dur="8.59">Jeremy Corbyn was out there looking at</text>
  <text start="230.18" dur="6.25">Theresa Mayes deal with the EU and the</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="3">Prime Minister Theresa May is</text>
  <text start="236.43" dur="5.399">continually out there saying that this</text>
  <text start="237.84" dur="5.88">is the best possible deal and Jeremy</text>
  <text start="241.829" dur="5.581">Corbyn said well this is the only deal</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="5.82">that you put forth so if you have just</text>
  <text start="247.41" dur="4.88">this one deal of course you&amp;#39;re gonna say</text>
  <text start="249.54" dur="5.339">this is the best possible deal and</text>
  <text start="252.29" dur="7.659">Jeremy Gordon Corbin is out there saying</text>
  <text start="254.879" dur="9.301">this entire plan it is not good for the</text>
  <text start="259.949" dur="7.051">people of the UK it&amp;#39;s not in favor and</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s actually going to make people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="267" dur="5.159">lives a lot worse it&amp;#39;s not going to make</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="3.449">it a lot better now of course what these</text>
  <text start="272.159" dur="4.051">individuals and what the central bank</text>
  <text start="273.419" dur="4.231">usually does they tell you how great</text>
  <text start="276.21" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s going to be they tell you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.65" dur="4.769">gonna be fantastic for you and you know</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="4.169">what don&amp;#39;t even look at it and if you</text>
  <text start="282.419" dur="7.351">don&amp;#39;t take it well we&amp;#39;re gonna make</text>
  <text start="284.699" dur="7.081">things worse for you we&amp;#39;re gonna make</text>
  <text start="289.77" dur="3.57">things so bad that you&amp;#39;ll have to take</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="4.7">this deal which tells you something if</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="6.08">someone is forcing you to do something</text>
  <text start="296.48" dur="4.23">that deal is absolutely awful and the</text>
  <text start="299.42" dur="3.42">central bankers as we can see in the</text>
  <text start="300.71" dur="5.88">brexit deal they never want to give up</text>
  <text start="302.84" dur="5.55">that control so Trump Xi Jinping Putin I</text>
  <text start="306.59" dur="4.56">do believe they&amp;#39;re all working together</text>
  <text start="308.39" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re all working towards a common</text>
  <text start="311.15" dur="3.36">goal and that is getting rid of the deep</text>
  <text start="313.19" dur="3.54">state getting rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="314.51" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re all working together now Trump</text>
  <text start="316.73" dur="4.71">when he was campaigning he said he was</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="5.37">gonna get rid of NAFTA we know NAFTA</text>
  <text start="321.44" dur="5.61">well there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that have</text>
  <text start="324.2" dur="6.03">to be done in Congress has to terminate</text>
  <text start="327.05" dur="5.61">NAFTA there has to be a vote so Trump</text>
  <text start="330.23" dur="3.93">decided that he was going to renegotiate</text>
  <text start="332.66" dur="4.47">the deal and he came up with this new</text>
  <text start="334.16" dur="6.63">deal the u.s. MCA and right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="6.96">saying okay it is time it is time to get</text>
  <text start="340.79" dur="5.4">rid of NAFTA it&amp;#39;s been a disaster for</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="5.01">the United States and we have a new deal</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="5.94">and he wants Congress to vote on this to</text>
  <text start="349.1" dur="5.94">get it rid of it completely and I think</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="6.27">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen once</text>
  <text start="355.04" dur="6.99">they get rid of NAFTA they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="4.74">eventually get rid of the US MCA and go</text>
  <text start="362.03" dur="4.02">in a completely different direction</text>
  <text start="363.14" dur="5.15">which will be bet a lot more beneficial</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="5.46">for the United States</text>
  <text start="368.29" dur="6.25">remember the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="371.51" dur="6.06">banking establishment they&amp;#39;ve created</text>
  <text start="374.54" dur="5.25">this spiderweb of laws and everything</text>
  <text start="377.57" dur="6.3">else to keep their system operational</text>
  <text start="379.79" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;ve done this on purpose to make</text>
  <text start="383.87" dur="4.98">sure that NOAA can just unwind it</text>
  <text start="385.76" dur="6.39">quickly I mean you can unwind it it just</text>
  <text start="388.85" dur="7.31">takes some time we see that Trump and</text>
  <text start="392.15" dur="7.89">gee they met during the talks in</text>
  <text start="396.16" dur="5.77">Argentina and we see that Trump and gee</text>
  <text start="400.04" dur="5.45">they agree to keep the us-china trade</text>
  <text start="401.93" dur="8.73">war from escalating they decided to</text>
  <text start="405.49" dur="8.41">temporarily halt the tariffs now this is</text>
  <text start="410.66" dur="5.7">very interesting we know that G and</text>
  <text start="413.9" dur="3.99">Trump they&amp;#39;re working together even</text>
  <text start="416.36" dur="4.08">though you even though you see these</text>
  <text start="417.89" dur="4.92">tariffs and you see what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="420.44" dur="3.68">they&amp;#39;re doing it on purpose they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="422.81" dur="4.49">doing it</text>
  <text start="424.12" dur="5.31">pletely against what the central banks</text>
  <text start="427.3" dur="4.35">actually wanted now remember China the</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="4.049">entire country of China is not against</text>
  <text start="431.65" dur="3.39">the United States there are certain deep</text>
  <text start="433.479" dur="3.271">state factions within the United States</text>
  <text start="435.04" dur="4.8">that the deep state here in the United</text>
  <text start="436.75" dur="7.919">States works with and they work in</text>
  <text start="439.84" dur="8.07">unison to try to mold everything in the</text>
  <text start="444.669" dur="5.521">way they want it and G and Trump right</text>
  <text start="447.91" dur="5.43">now they are undoing this Putin is</text>
  <text start="450.19" dur="4.8">undoing this so right now there&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="3.96">be no more tariffs now the reason for</text>
  <text start="454.99" dur="5.1">the tariffs was to bring the United</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="4.619">States back to a level where we could</text>
  <text start="460.09" dur="4.56">have trade and even out the trade</text>
  <text start="461.919" dur="5.611">platform Trump&amp;#39;s been telling telling us</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="5.82">about this for a very long time since</text>
  <text start="467.53" dur="5.31">they put this truce into place I believe</text>
  <text start="470.47" dur="4.02">this is going to move forward and things</text>
  <text start="472.84" dur="5.25">are stark are gonna start to even out</text>
  <text start="474.49" dur="5.19">between China and the US or a certain</text>
  <text start="478.09" dur="4.47">inner workings behind the scenes that</text>
  <text start="479.68" dur="5.91">were going on and I do believe they are</text>
  <text start="482.56" dur="4.44">preparing and getting ready to go after</text>
  <text start="485.59" dur="3.93">the central bank there needed to be</text>
  <text start="487" dur="3.45">certain things in place before this</text>
  <text start="489.52" dur="2.34">happens and a lot of things are</text>
  <text start="490.45" dur="3.149">happening behind the scenes just like</text>
  <text start="491.86" dur="3.809">with the deep state I mean just because</text>
  <text start="493.599" dur="4.141">you don&amp;#39;t see what&amp;#39;s happening doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="495.669" dur="4.801">mean there&amp;#39;s not anything going on and</text>
  <text start="497.74" dur="4.679">right now ji putin they&amp;#39;ve been b</text>
  <text start="500.47" dur="4.919">they&amp;#39;ve been talking behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="502.419" dur="7.351">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing this entire</text>
  <text start="505.389" dur="7.32">system to break away from the central</text>
  <text start="509.77" dur="5.569">bank establishment and this is why Trump</text>
  <text start="512.709" dur="6.151">has been out there contradicting the Fed</text>
  <text start="515.339" dur="5.89">every chance that he gets making sure</text>
  <text start="518.86" dur="4.229">that everyone understands who is</text>
  <text start="521.229" dur="3.391">responsible and when everyone when you</text>
  <text start="523.089" dur="3.601">start it when you think of the Fed and</text>
  <text start="524.62" dur="5.13">and when you think of what they do and</text>
  <text start="526.69" dur="5.49">what they&amp;#39;re all about everyone connects</text>
  <text start="529.75" dur="3.87">the dots and they say okay it&amp;#39;s the Fed</text>
  <text start="532.18" dur="3.57">while they&amp;#39;re connected to the IMF</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re connected to the ECB they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.75" dur="4.589">connected to the biz they&amp;#39;re connected</text>
  <text start="537.25" dur="6.45">to all of it they&amp;#39;re connected to the</text>
  <text start="540.339" dur="4.921">Rothschild banking system and this is</text>
  <text start="543.7" dur="4.17">why Trump is pointing out the Fed</text>
  <text start="545.26" dur="4.89">because right now the Fed they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="3.99">one who are dictating what should be</text>
  <text start="550.15" dur="2.939">going on because if you look back in</text>
  <text start="551.86" dur="3.539">time</text>
  <text start="553.089" dur="4.05">each country had a private western</text>
  <text start="555.399" dur="3.36">central bank that was in control and had</text>
  <text start="557.139" dur="3.721">the reserve currency of the world</text>
  <text start="558.759" dur="4.8">this time it&amp;#39;s much much larger it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.86" dur="5.729">much much much more global than it ever</text>
  <text start="563.559" dur="5.101">was before and the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="566.589" dur="5.16">move it from country to country after</text>
  <text start="568.66" dur="5.94">usually a major major event after World</text>
  <text start="571.749" dur="4.77">War two I mean it was England now it</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="4.039">moved to the United States and after</text>
  <text start="576.519" dur="7.19">this event that they wanted to have</text>
  <text start="578.639" dur="8.32">maybe 2019 2020 around that time period</text>
  <text start="583.709" dur="6.581">after that event the war it was going to</text>
  <text start="586.959" dur="6.54">move to China and the IMF was going to</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="7.14">be working with this new currency but</text>
  <text start="593.499" dur="7.14">now everything&amp;#39;s changed now the</text>
  <text start="597.43" dur="6.449">narrative has turned on the central bank</text>
