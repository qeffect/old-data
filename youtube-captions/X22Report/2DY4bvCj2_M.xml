  <text start="81.159" dur="5.311">could but you can definitely notice from</text>
  <text start="84.13" dur="6.059">the graph of how the market did where</text>

  <text start="110.38" dur="4.41">following in the footsteps of the United</text>

  <text start="122.65" dur="5.1">doing very well we have added the jobs</text>
  <text start="124.75" dur="5.909">and then a month later they thought</text>
  <text start="127.75" dur="5.819">there was going to be a 10,000 drop in</text>
  <text start="130.659" dur="6.511">jobs in November now this was back about</text>
  <text start="133.569" dur="8.581">two to three months now and instead of a</text>
  <text start="137.17" dur="8.01">10,000 drop all of a sudden they came</text>
  <text start="142.15" dur="7.13">out with numbers saying that 70 1400</text>
  <text start="145.18" dur="6.779">jobs were added the most in 15 years and</text>
  <text start="149.28" dur="6.28">this is the equivalent of 1 million jobs</text>
  <text start="151.959" dur="6.42">added in the US now the corporate media</text>
  <text start="155.56" dur="4.53">the alternative media was out there and</text>
  <text start="158.379" dur="4.111">they&amp;#39;re saying ok something doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="160.09" dur="4.16">sense here this can&amp;#39;t be true but the</text>
  <text start="162.49" dur="6.329">government say yes these are the numbers</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="9.549">everything is fine and we come to find</text>
  <text start="168.819" dur="6.601">out that all of this was completely</text>
  <text start="173.799" dur="3.961">manipulated now they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="175.42" dur="4.849">technical error of course this is what</text>
  <text start="177.76" dur="4.68">they use when they get caught and</text>
  <text start="180.269" dur="6.821">Australia&amp;#39;s Treasury secretary John</text>
  <text start="182.44" dur="7.2">Fraser he was testifying uh in front of</text>
  <text start="187.09" dur="4.11">the parliamentary committee and he</text>
  <text start="189.64" dur="4.189">admitted that the job growth for the two</text>
  <text start="191.2" dur="5.67">months in question may have been</text>
  <text start="193.829" dur="5.621">overstated and of course they said it</text>
  <text start="196.87" dur="5.79">was technical issues it&amp;#39;s the same thing</text>
  <text start="199.45" dur="5.34">the u.s. uses where they said yeah we</text>
  <text start="202.66" dur="4.32">had problems and the numbers weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="204.79" dur="4.949">right it&amp;#39;s almost like when we look back</text>
  <text start="206.98" dur="5.58">at the GDP numbers we look at the</text>
  <text start="209.739" dur="5.131">unemployment numbers when we look at the</text>
  <text start="212.56" dur="4.95">sales of homes they always go back and</text>
  <text start="214.87" dur="6.63">they revised the numbers down when no</text>
  <text start="217.51" dur="6.75">one is looking they pump him up but we</text>
  <text start="221.5" dur="5.819">are catching what they&amp;#39;re doing every</text>
  <text start="224.26" dur="4.44">single time and we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot</text>
  <text start="227.319" dur="4.14">of countries do this because as the</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="5.31">economy completely falls apart they need</text>
  <text start="231.459" dur="5.851">a way to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="234.01" dur="5.64">everything is fine and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="9.179">do this because what we&amp;#39;re seeing out in</text>
  <text start="239.65" dur="11.519">the economy it is slowly dying and it is</text>
  <text start="246.489" dur="7.381">not going to recover any time soon the</text>
  <text start="251.169" dur="6.75">Baltic Dry Index right now dropped</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="5.339">another point it&amp;#39;s at 290 and I see in</text>
  <text start="257.919" dur="2.97">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="259.209" dur="4.591">mention the ball to join next which they</text>
  <text start="260.889" dur="5.071">normally never do and I see one of the</text>
  <text start="263.8" dur="4.53">headlines out there saying that the</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="3.51">Baltic index plunges to all-time lows</text>
  <text start="268.33" dur="3.48">because eventually they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="269.47" dur="7.83">to recognize to something going on here</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="8.43">and it says this could spark recession</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="4.35">fears well we&amp;#39;ve been tracking the</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="3.27">Baltic Dry Index for a very long time</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="4.56">and if you notice the corporate media</text>
  <text start="283.51" dur="4.83">only steps in when they have to because</text>
  <text start="286.21" dur="4.739">people are saying well what about this</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="4.17">aren&amp;#39;t you reporting on this it&amp;#39;s so low</text>
  <text start="290.949" dur="5.551">right now no one has ever seen this</text>
  <text start="292.51" dur="5.28">before what does this mean well what it</text>
  <text start="296.5" dur="6.12">means is is that</text>
  <text start="297.79" dur="7.47">global trade is seizing up this is a</text>
  <text start="302.62" dur="7.58">record decline for the 12th straight</text>

  <text start="310.2" dur="11.23">down from its peak of 11,000 793 in May</text>
  <text start="317.05" dur="9.24">of 2008 marking the lowest level since</text>
  <text start="321.43" dur="8.43">the record began in 1985 we are not</text>
  <text start="326.29" dur="6.8">sparking fears of a recession we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="329.86" dur="9.63">even in a recession we are in a global</text>
  <text start="333.09" dur="9.16">depression at this point the CEO of</text>

  <text start="363.7" dur="6.3">really when has the IMF ever been</text>
  <text start="366.79" dur="4.5">correct in their predictions of course</text>
  <text start="370" dur="5.22">what they do is they come out and they</text>

  <text start="378.67" dur="4.62">even better i&amp;#39;ll be 3.5 and we know</text>
  <text start="381.01" dur="7.53">these numbers are always revised lower</text>
  <text start="383.29" dur="8.25">and we see in the year of 2015 form s-4</text>
  <text start="388.54" dur="7.71">Maersk profits fell a whopping</text>
  <text start="391.54" dur="8.22">eighty-four percent and this is showing</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="7.74">us that something is wrong he went on to</text>
  <text start="399.76" dur="9.9">say that well things are a lot worse</text>
  <text start="403.99" dur="10.08">than we thought how bad is it well it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="443.48" dur="6">on our hands right now and it&amp;#39;s worse</text>
  <text start="447.889" dur="5.761">than two thousand eight and we know what</text>

  <text start="462.47" dur="9.48">a collapse but again no one&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="465.86" dur="8.76">admit this nobody now Deutsche Bank they</text>
  <text start="471.95" dur="6.63">are having a huge amount of troubles</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="6.96">their bank stock has dropped and we see</text>
  <text start="478.58" dur="6.48">that David Stockman is out there and he</text>
  <text start="481.58" dur="8.22">is saying that the Deutsche Bank CEO</text>
  <text start="485.06" dur="6.18">John crime when he said Germany&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.8" dur="2.58">largest bank is rock solid it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="3.929">contained there&amp;#39;s nothing to worry about</text>
  <text start="492.38" dur="6.18">he is saying everyone should start</text>
  <text start="495.169" dur="5.031">worrying at this point and I agree and</text>
  <text start="498.56" dur="4.65">this is what we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="500.2" dur="7.6">anytime these people come out and say</text>
  <text start="503.21" dur="7.59">it&amp;#39;s contained the problem is fine look</text>
  <text start="507.8" dur="6.33">over there we have a huge problem on our</text>
  <text start="510.8" dur="9.72">hands and that means this company this</text>
  <text start="514.13" dur="9.69">bank it&amp;#39;s going to collapse and whenever</text>
  <text start="520.52" dur="6.45">they come out there everyone should be</text>
  <text start="523.82" dur="5.85">aware that we have major problems coming</text>
  <text start="526.97" dur="7.98">now to boost Deutsche Bank and other</text>
  <text start="529.67" dur="8.91">bank stocks up the ECB came out and they</text>
  <text start="534.95" dur="7.53">spread a rumor that the ECB may monetize</text>
  <text start="538.58" dur="9.41">bank stocks I mean look how far they</text>
  <text start="542.48" dur="9.33">have to go to keep this system alive</text>
  <text start="547.99" dur="6.58">because this system is one gigantic</text>
  <text start="551.81" dur="5.25">bubble which is ready to come crashing</text>
  <text start="554.57" dur="3.959">down and if Deutsche Bank goes guess</text>
  <text start="557.06" dur="3.87">what this thing is going to spread</text>
  <text start="558.529" dur="5.701">across Europe it&amp;#39;s going to hit the</text>
  <text start="560.93" dur="4.8">United States and it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="564.23" dur="5.39">major made</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="6.39">problem so they put out a trial balloon</text>
  <text start="569.62" dur="7.45">saying that yeah well we might be able</text>
  <text start="572.12" dur="7.019">to monetize the bank stocks and we saw</text>
  <text start="577.07" dur="6.84">all of a sudden deutsche bank stock</text>
  <text start="579.139" dur="8.461">skyrocket at this point and we can see</text>
  <text start="583.91" dur="7.26">at this point they&amp;#39;re using everything</text>
  <text start="587.6" dur="10.289">they possibly have to keep the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="12.27">propped up now JP Morgan is out there</text>
  <text start="597.889" dur="9.51">and they&amp;#39;re saying that the ECB Bank of</text>
  <text start="603.44" dur="6.12">Japan and even the Fed they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="607.399" dur="4.921">they&amp;#39;re going to cut rates even further</text>
  <text start="609.56" dur="4.62">and this is their prediction they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="612.32" dur="4.44">saying the ECB is going to cut rates to</text>
  <text start="614.18" dur="3.659">negative four point five percent the</text>
  <text start="616.76" dur="3.629">Bank of Japan is going to be negative</text>
  <text start="617.839" dur="5.221">three point four five percent and they</text>
  <text start="620.389" dur="4.051">said if the Fed eventually is going to</text>
  <text start="623.06" dur="7.889">bring the rates down to negative one</text>
  <text start="624.44" dur="10.709">point three percent this is again this</text>
  <text start="630.949" dur="8.311">is how desperate they are when have you</text>
  <text start="635.149" dur="7.471">ever seen negative interest rates like</text>
  <text start="639.26" dur="7.86">what they&amp;#39;re predicting here never why</text>
  <text start="642.62" dur="6.709">would you even have to do this well you</text>
  <text start="647.12" dur="4.86">would have to do this to save the banks</text>
  <text start="649.329" dur="5.081">you would have to do this to try to save</text>
  <text start="651.98" dur="5.82">the economy because they don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="654.41" dur="6.679">else to do they created money they</text>
  <text start="657.8" dur="6.18">created money they created money i</text>
  <text start="661.089" dur="5.591">should say currency and they continually</text>
  <text start="663.98" dur="5.039">did this none of it came down to the</text>
  <text start="666.68" dur="5.459">people and went all to the banks into</text>
  <text start="669.019" dur="6.421">the stock market the banks are insolvent</text>
  <text start="672.139" dur="4.831">the banks are teetering on collapsing</text>
  <text start="675.44" dur="3.87">and bringing all the other banks down</text>
  <text start="676.97" dur="8.25">and they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly</text>
  <text start="679.31" dur="7.68">can to keep the system alive and we see</text>
  <text start="685.22" dur="4.59">that there are some people out there</text>
  <text start="686.99" dur="7.349">saying part of these negative interest</text>
  <text start="689.81" dur="6.57">rates is to drive small banks out of</text>
  <text start="694.339" dur="4.811">business so they can eliminate cash</text>
  <text start="696.38" dur="5.53">altogether</text>
  <text start="699.15" dur="5.94">more than one-fifth of the world&amp;#39;s total</text>
  <text start="701.91" dur="5.22">GDP is in countries which have imposed</text>
  <text start="705.09" dur="5.63">negative interest rates including Japan</text>
  <text start="707.13" dur="5.61">EU Denmark Switzerland and Sweden</text>
  <text start="710.72" dur="5.89">negative interest rates as we know are</text>
  <text start="712.74" dur="5.67">spreading worldwide and yet negative</text>
  <text start="716.61" dur="4.95">interest rates supposed to help</text>
  <text start="718.41" dur="5.13">economies recover well they haven&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="721.56" dur="6.54">anything for Japan or Europe and they</text>
  <text start="723.54" dur="6.75">will not do anything for the u.s. so</text>
  <text start="728.1" dur="4.38">they really thought by bringing down the</text>
  <text start="730.29" dur="5.37">interest rates people would not keep</text>
  <text start="732.48" dur="5.97">their cash in the banks I don&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="735.66" dur="4.17">you would but they thought people would</text>
  <text start="738.45" dur="2.43">go out and say okay you know what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="739.83" dur="4.47">going to spend the money I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="740.88" dur="6.09">put it in the stock market and what</text>
  <text start="744.3" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re noticing is that with these</text>
  <text start="746.97" dur="5.93">negative interest rates in Japan in</text>
  <text start="748.59" dur="8.57">Europe they&amp;#39;re noticing that consumers</text>
  <text start="752.9" dur="11.95">they&amp;#39;re not spending their cash in fact</text>
  <text start="757.16" dur="12.93">they&amp;#39;re saving their cash so why is this</text>
  <text start="764.85" dur="7.86">happening because everyone is scared</text>
  <text start="770.09" dur="7.9">lower interest rates have wrecked many</text>

  <text start="998.629" dur="6.491">UK telling everyone that everything is</text>
  <text start="1001.43" dur="6.649">fine the economies are doing well and</text>
  <text start="1005.12" dur="6.569">then all of a sudden everything crashes</text>
  <text start="1008.079" dur="7.981">well they can&amp;#39;t let this happen they</text>
  <text start="1011.689" dur="8.371">can&amp;#39;t be blamed for what is coming</text>
  <text start="1016.06" dur="7.449">because as we know when this system</text>
  <text start="1020.06" dur="7.83">falls apart they want to restart it</text>
  <text start="1023.509" dur="7.981">again they know the systems dying they</text>
  <text start="1027.89" dur="6.63">know it can&amp;#39;t be sustained they just</text>
  <text start="1031.49" dur="8.61">want it done in their way so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1034.52" dur="8">blamed so later on after the wars after</text>
  <text start="1040.1" dur="6.78">everything else they can completely</text>
  <text start="1042.52" dur="6.34">restart the system and start from</text>
  <text start="1046.88" dur="5.31">scratch once again and this is why we</text>
  <text start="1048.86" dur="5.61">see a lot of this moving from the west</text>
  <text start="1052.19" dur="4.92">to the east because the new system is</text>
  <text start="1054.47" dur="5.67">being set up right now the system in</text>
  <text start="1057.11" dur="5.25">China the system in Russia now does this</text>
  <text start="1060.14" dur="3.6">mean the central bankers are not going</text>
  <text start="1062.36" dur="4.58">to have control of this new system well</text>
  <text start="1063.74" dur="5.58">no they&amp;#39;re going to have control and</text>
  <text start="1066.94" dur="3.88">when I say we started it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="1069.32" dur="4.349">it&amp;#39;s going to be the central bank in the</text>
  <text start="1070.82" dur="3.979">United States because the central</text>
  <text start="1073.669" dur="3.361">bankers don&amp;#39;t care where they&amp;#39;re located</text>
  <text start="1074.799" dur="4.531">they have no allegiance to a government</text>
  <text start="1077.03" dur="5.82">they have no allegiance to a people</text>
  <text start="1079.33" dur="6.76">their allegiance is to debt to</text>
  <text start="1082.85" dur="7.52">themselves so at this point it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1086.09" dur="8.459">really matter where it is but we do have</text>
  <text start="1090.37" dur="7.33">competing governments that want the</text>
  <text start="1094.549" dur="5.941">reserve currency the u.s. does</text>
  <text start="1097.7" dur="9.63">want to give this up they will fight for</text>
  <text start="1100.49" dur="10.189">it and as we move forward it is going to</text>
  <text start="1107.33" dur="6.03">get worse the economy will not improve</text>
  <text start="1110.679" dur="4.84">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible for the</text>
  <text start="1113.36" dur="4.319">economy to improve will they make it</text>
  <text start="1115.519" dur="4.051">look like it&amp;#39;s improving yes they will</text>
  <text start="1117.679" dur="5.911">do whatever they possibly can to make it</text>
  <text start="1119.57" dur="8.069">look like it&amp;#39;s getting better and we see</text>
  <text start="1123.59" dur="8.28">out in the Middle East with Iran they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1127.639" dur="8.25">ready to accept a hundred billion in</text>
  <text start="1131.87" dur="8.63">foreign investments to add to the</text>
  <text start="1135.889" dur="7.41">trouble we see they&amp;#39;re ready to bring in</text>
  <text start="1140.5" dur="6.01">investments into their country they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1143.299" dur="8.911">not going to use the dollar on their oil</text>
  <text start="1146.51" dur="9.35">trade and this again is a problem for</text>
  <text start="1152.21" dur="7.559">the United States because the system is</text>
  <text start="1155.86" dur="9.13">based on all of these countries using</text>
  <text start="1159.769" dur="8.071">the dollar on their oil trade and if</text>
  <text start="1164.99" dur="5.909">each one of these countries do not do</text>
  <text start="1167.84" dur="5.309">this this system comes crumbling down</text>
  <text start="1170.899" dur="4.351">and this is what they&amp;#39;re very worried</text>
  <text start="1173.149" dur="4.53">about this is why John Kerry was out</text>
  <text start="1175.25" dur="4.679">there saying if we do not make the deal</text>
  <text start="1177.679" dur="3.63">with Iran the dollar collapses well they</text>
  <text start="1179.929" dur="3.24">made the deal with Iran which had</text>
  <text start="1181.309" dur="3.391">nothing to do with nuclear weapons and</text>
  <text start="1183.169" dur="3.271">how to do with the central bank and how</text>
  <text start="1184.7" dur="3.78">to do with oil it had to do with the</text>
  <text start="1186.44" dur="5.609">dollar as the reserve currency the petro</text>
  <text start="1188.48" dur="5.61">dollar but we see Iran&amp;#39;s not going along</text>
  <text start="1192.049" dur="4.26">with this we see Iran is saying you know</text>
  <text start="1194.09" dur="5.88">what we&amp;#39;re not going to be doing this</text>
  <text start="1196.309" dur="9.75">because they know and they realize the</text>
  <text start="1199.97" dur="9.99">dollar is dead the dollar can no longer</text>
  <text start="1206.059" dur="6.541">be used by other countries because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1209.96" dur="5.79">losing all credibility there&amp;#39;s too much</text>
  <text start="1212.6" dur="4.86">debt and this economic system that</text>
  <text start="1215.75" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;ve created the central banks have</text>
  <text start="1217.46" dur="7.89">created is completely and utterly dying</text>
