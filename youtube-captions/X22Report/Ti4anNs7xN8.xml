  <text start="213.06" dur="3.78">they continually point to these cities</text>
  <text start="215.04" dur="3.39">telling us how great it is but when we</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="3.899">look at every other area in the country</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="4.65">well it&amp;#39;s not doing that great and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="220.739" dur="4.351">seeing traffic start to slow prices are</text>
  <text start="223.08" dur="4.2">coming down and interest rates are</text>
  <text start="225.09" dur="3.509">rising which is which basically is</text>
  <text start="227.28" dur="5.91">kicking a lot of people out of the</text>

  <text start="233.19" dur="3.9">existing home sales for September and</text>
  <text start="235.11" dur="4.05">they were completely awful they fell by</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="5.07">four point one one percent from a year</text>
  <text start="239.16" dur="5.609">ago this is the lowest since November</text>
  <text start="242.16" dur="5.669">2015 and the National Association of</text>
  <text start="244.769" dur="5.491">Realtors blame this on high mortgage</text>
  <text start="247.829" dur="4.141">rates yes mortgage rates are moving up</text>
  <text start="250.26" dur="4.65">but when we really look at the mortgage</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="4.739">rates they&amp;#39;re still very low I mean the</text>
  <text start="254.91" dur="4.199">Fed has been heightened its policy rates</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="4.77">and mortgage rates have been rising and</text>
  <text start="259.109" dur="5.041">they&amp;#39;re around 5% or a little bit over</text>
  <text start="261.479" dur="6.211">5% this is for a 30-year fixed-rate and</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="7.47">this is still very low when you compare</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="7.65">it to previous years especially before</text>
  <text start="271.62" dur="9.15">the financial crisis so while this may</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="7.889">seem high by 2016 2017 2018 standards it</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="4.619">remains low compared to rates in the pre</text>
  <text start="283.229" dur="4.431">financial crisis error now let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="285.389" dur="5.041">about the inventory of existing homes</text>
  <text start="287.66" dur="5.17">they edged up by 1.1 percent</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="5.669">year-over-year to about 1.8 million</text>
  <text start="292.83" dur="6">homes unsold inventory rose to about</text>
  <text start="296.099" dur="4.201">four point four months supply the</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="5.28">National Association of Realtors</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re telling us that the supply well</text>
  <text start="304.11" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot more of it</text>
  <text start="306.06" dur="2.34">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot more of single-family</text>
  <text start="307.68" dur="2.7">homes</text>
  <text start="308.4" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot more of condos coops</text>
  <text start="310.38" dur="7.14">and when we start to look at this we can</text>
  <text start="313.5" dur="7.379">see we&amp;#39;re way above where we were just a</text>
  <text start="317.52" dur="7.019">couple of months ago what does this mean</text>
  <text start="320.879" dur="7.47">well we&amp;#39;ve entered the early stages of a</text>
  <text start="324.539" dur="6.33">buyers market should supply levels cross</text>
  <text start="328.349" dur="5.19">above five months we will be watching</text>
  <text start="330.869" dur="5.28">for flat possibly declining resale</text>
  <text start="333.539" dur="4.951">prices in some markets especially where</text>
  <text start="336.149" dur="4.98">affordability is already very stretched</text>
  <text start="338.49" dur="5.909">so this is the beginning of a buyers</text>
  <text start="341.129" dur="5.641">market and it arrived around April or</text>
  <text start="344.399" dur="5.22">May of this year if we look at some of</text>
  <text start="346.77" dur="5.159">these numbers here real estate is local</text>
  <text start="349.619" dur="6.03">and local results may vary between you</text>
  <text start="351.929" dur="5.401">know each area but overall we can see</text>
  <text start="355.649" dur="4.26">that this is definitely happening now we</text>
  <text start="357.33" dur="4.829">saw the same thing happen during the</text>
  <text start="359.909" dur="3.81">financial crisis where all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="362.159" dur="3.72">to turn into a buyers market an what I</text>
  <text start="363.719" dur="4.56">mean by that is prices started to drop</text>
  <text start="365.879" dur="3.451">buyers would sit on the sidelines and</text>
  <text start="368.279" dur="4.021">they would say well I&amp;#39;m gonna wait for</text>
  <text start="369.33" dur="5.099">the prices to come down and I will give</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="5.069">offers in that are much much lower than</text>
  <text start="374.429" dur="4.86">what the seller is asking for when this</text>
  <text start="377.369" dur="4.07">happens sellers start to take their</text>
  <text start="379.289" dur="4.5">houses off the market especially those</text>
  <text start="381.439" dur="4.63">individuals that purchased at the height</text>
  <text start="383.789" dur="7.11">of the market and now they have to come</text>
  <text start="386.069" dur="7.28">down 20 30 40 50 60 $70,000 even more so</text>
  <text start="390.899" dur="5.58">we can see that we&amp;#39;re entering the same</text>
  <text start="393.349" dur="5.831">time frame that that we were right</text>
  <text start="396.479" dur="4.59">before the financial crisis of own I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="4.889">this is we&amp;#39;re probably looking around Oh</text>
  <text start="401.069" dur="5.07">seven right now and everything is</text>
  <text start="404.069" dur="4.05">starting to switch now as mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="406.139" dur="6.3">move up its gonna kick a lot more people</text>
  <text start="408.119" dur="5.76">out of the housing arena and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="412.439" dur="3.06">gonna wait and say you know something</text>
  <text start="413.879" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re not ready to buy that means the</text>
  <text start="415.499" dur="5.37">buyers traffic will dry up sellers will</text>
  <text start="418.079" dur="4.531">have to reduce prices and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="420.869" dur="5.01">to and buyers are going to wait until</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="7.079">these prices come down to a certain</text>
  <text start="425.879" dur="6.21">level so we can see right now that we</text>
  <text start="429.689" dur="6.03">are at the beginning stages of all of</text>
  <text start="432.089" dur="6.57">this now we know that the Fed has been</text>
  <text start="435.719" dur="5.73">raising rates and this is being done on</text>
  <text start="438.659" dur="5.31">purpose and we know there&amp;#39;s a neutral</text>
  <text start="441.449" dur="5.041">point where the rates hit a certain area</text>
  <text start="443.969" dur="5.79">where we know that things are going to</text>
  <text start="446.49" dur="6.299">fall apart and Powell is going to raise</text>
  <text start="449.759" dur="4.471">these rates he&amp;#39;s not going to stop Trump</text>
  <text start="452.789" dur="2.731">knows this</text>
  <text start="454.23" dur="3.54">I mean he&amp;#39;s been talking to the media</text>
  <text start="455.52" dur="4.05">contradicting the Fed same thing he did</text>
  <text start="457.77" dur="3.75">with session same thing we did with</text>
  <text start="459.57" dur="3.39">North Korea saying wow I don&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="461.52" dur="2.73">he&amp;#39;s doing this doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="462.96" dur="3.63">sense this is not the right time I</text>
  <text start="464.25" dur="3.63">thought he was an easy money Fed and I</text>
  <text start="466.59" dur="3.72">didn&amp;#39;t realize he was an interest rate</text>
  <text start="467.88" dur="4.02">fed of course he did he put him into</text>
  <text start="470.31" dur="5.97">this position he knew exactly who this</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="7.17">person was so fed Kaplan of the Dallas</text>
  <text start="476.28" dur="6.96">Federal Reserve is saying listen we have</text>
  <text start="479.07" dur="7.23">about two or more two to three more rate</text>
  <text start="483.24" dur="5.4">hikes and we will meet that neutral</text>
  <text start="486.3" dur="5.64">level of around 3% that&amp;#39;s the magic</text>
  <text start="488.64" dur="6.12">number and the Fed Kaplan kind of gave</text>
  <text start="491.94" dur="6">us a timeline of when this will happen</text>
  <text start="494.76" dur="5.85">and if the Fed continues to do what</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re doing which they most likely are</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="5.79">going to continue to do what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="502.35" dur="8.3">doing we&amp;#39;re going to hit this area on or</text>
  <text start="506.4" dur="7.05">or around June 2019 now as we approach</text>
  <text start="510.65" dur="5.079">this timeline this time frame that</text>
  <text start="513.45" dur="4.56">doesn&amp;#39;t mean on June 9 June 2019</text>
  <text start="515.729" dur="5.161">everything just falls apart we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="518.01" dur="5.94">to see it fall apart as they continually</text>
  <text start="520.89" dur="5.28">raise the rates each time now they might</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="6.57">adjust this they might not raise it as</text>
  <text start="526.17" dur="5.94">much in December or February or whenever</text>
  <text start="530.52" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re planning to do this they might</text>
  <text start="532.11" dur="4.14">adjust it it might be August it might be</text>
  <text start="534.36" dur="6.24">a little bit sooner but it&amp;#39;s around the</text>
  <text start="536.25" dur="6.81">middle of 2019 and this will start the</text>
  <text start="540.6" dur="5.28">collapse of the economy actually the</text>
  <text start="543.06" dur="4.77">collapse will be happening while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.88" dur="3.39">raising rates but again these</text>
  <text start="547.83" dur="4.23">statistical numbers with the stock</text>
  <text start="549.27" dur="4.65">market with GDP numbers with</text>
  <text start="552.06" dur="3.66">unemployment it&amp;#39;s not going to show that</text>
  <text start="553.92" dur="3.72">anything is happening but we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="555.72" dur="4.68">show that everything&amp;#39;s starting to fall</text>
  <text start="557.64" dur="6.06">down fall apart and fall down now once</text>
  <text start="560.4" dur="5.55">the Fed reaches this magical number and</text>
  <text start="563.7" dur="6.51">things really start to break apart and</text>
  <text start="565.95" dur="5.91">if we look back in 2005-2006 where the</text>
  <text start="570.21" dur="4.23">Fed raised the rates they raised it and</text>
  <text start="571.86" dur="4.2">I believe the middle or the end of 2006</text>
  <text start="574.44" dur="4.05">they hit a certain point and then they</text>
  <text start="576.06" dur="5.04">started to drop the rates in 2007 and</text>
  <text start="578.49" dur="5.16">they came down pretty darn fast the</text>
  <text start="581.1" dur="5.13">economy was already falling apart in the</text>
  <text start="583.65" dur="3.9">beginning of 2007 and it got worse and</text>
  <text start="586.23" dur="4.109">worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="587.55" dur="5.52">time went on throughout the year of 2007</text>
  <text start="590.339" dur="4.981">and when we hit 2008 things really</text>
  <text start="593.07" dur="4.05">started to speed up and things started</text>
  <text start="595.32" dur="4.699">to fall apart very very rapidly I</text>
  <text start="597.12" dur="6.089">believe we&amp;#39;re gonna see the same thing</text>
  <text start="600.019" dur="6.31">2019 the middle of 2019 that will be the</text>
  <text start="603.209" dur="4.56">trigger and then by the end of 2019 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.329" dur="4.5">really gonna fall apart and if</text>
  <text start="607.769" dur="4.711">everything holds steady in 2020 things</text>
  <text start="610.829" dur="3.721">are gonna start to really crumble apart</text>
  <text start="612.48" dur="4.74">and fall apart and the economy is going</text>
  <text start="614.55" dur="5.46">to start to implode on itself and I</text>
  <text start="617.22" dur="5.25">believe at this time the Fed the deep</text>
  <text start="620.01" dur="3.84">state those individuals and we have to</text>
  <text start="622.47" dur="3.179">remember there&amp;#39;s certain individuals in</text>
  <text start="623.85" dur="3.179">these organizations that are not working</text>
  <text start="625.649" dur="4.261">with Trump they&amp;#39;re working against them</text>
  <text start="627.029" dur="5.701">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to blame Trump on all</text>
  <text start="629.91" dur="4.5">of this Trump and his administration the</text>

  <text start="634.41" dur="3.419">say it is the Fed that&amp;#39;s why Trump has</text>
  <text start="636.029" dur="4.141">been setting up the narrative so we can</text>
  <text start="637.829" dur="5.851">see already that this is moving towards</text>
  <text start="640.17" dur="5.4">that time frame and remember this is not</text>
  <text start="643.68" dur="3.599">a crystal ball we&amp;#39;re not predicting any</text>

  <text start="670.62" dur="5.969">right now to protect themselves from the</text>
  <text start="673.74" dur="6.21">next global crisis remember the insiders</text>
  <text start="676.589" dur="6.181">know exactly when something is going to</text>
  <text start="679.95" dur="5.16">fall apart and they always know in</text>
  <text start="682.77" dur="4.95">advance they know exactly what to do and</text>
  <text start="685.11" dur="4.979">all the retail investors and the house</text>
  <text start="687.72" dur="4.59">flippers they have no clue they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="700.079" dur="3.51">continue and I&amp;#39;m going to keep doing</text>
  <text start="701.37" dur="3.54">this and then all of a sudden those</text>
  <text start="703.589" dur="2.43">people who are in the market those</text>
  <text start="704.91" dur="2.58">people are in the housing market or</text>
  <text start="706.019" dur="4.351">flipping they&amp;#39;re the ones who actually</text>
  <text start="707.49" dur="4.44">get hurt and then these people come in</text>
  <text start="710.37" dur="3.18">and buy up the same exact thing that</text>
  <text start="711.93" dur="4.74">they dumped for pennies on the dollar</text>
  <text start="713.55" dur="5.82">this is how it works but we can see</text>
  <text start="716.67" dur="3.9">already that countries are preparing for</text>
  <text start="719.37" dur="4.29">all of this</text>
  <text start="720.57" dur="5.7">and we&amp;#39;re getting ready to transition</text>
  <text start="723.66" dur="4.92">into a completely new system actually we</text>
  <text start="726.27" dur="4.89">are transitioning right now remember</text>
  <text start="728.58" dur="3.9">Russia and China they pledged to reduce</text>
  <text start="731.16" dur="2.97">their reliance on the dollar by</text>
  <text start="732.48" dur="5.13">increasing the amount of bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="734.13" dur="6.47">conducted in rubles and yuan they</text>
  <text start="737.61" dur="5.82">created their own payment systems now</text>
  <text start="740.6" dur="5.62">Russia started this back in 2014 and we</text>
  <text start="743.43" dur="5.43">reported on this because we saw what was</text>
  <text start="746.22" dur="5.79">happening at that time they had it</text>
  <text start="748.86" dur="4.62">completed for their internal payment</text>
  <text start="752.01" dur="4.74">system remember it wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to go</text>
  <text start="753.48" dur="5.31">global now the Russian alternative known</text>
  <text start="756.75" dur="4.74">as the system for transfer of financial</text>
  <text start="758.79" dur="4.83">messages has attracted a modest amount</text>
  <text start="761.49" dur="3.84">of support within the Russian business</text>
  <text start="763.62" dur="3.6">community with about four hundred and</text>
  <text start="765.33" dur="5.46">sixteen Russian companies that have</text>
  <text start="767.22" dur="5.37">joined this and now after a senior</text>
  <text start="770.79" dur="3.03">Russian official aligns that our banks</text>
  <text start="772.59" dur="3.27">are ready to turn to Swift</text>
  <text start="773.82" dur="5.78">it appears the system has reached</text>
  <text start="775.86" dur="6.78">another milestone it&amp;#39;s ready to take on</text>
  <text start="779.6" dur="5.41">international partners in the quest to</text>
  <text start="782.64" dur="4.41">de dollar eyes and end the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="785.01" dur="6.06">leverage over the international</text>
  <text start="787.05" dur="7.11">financial system so Turkey China India</text>
  <text start="791.07" dur="5.43">and many others are among the countries</text>
  <text start="794.16" dur="6.33">that might be interested in Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="796.5" dur="6.57">payment system and once these countries</text>
  <text start="800.49" dur="5.19">start to join and start to use it other</text>
  <text start="803.07" dur="5.37">countries in the BRIC system are going</text>
  <text start="805.68" dur="4.92">to decide to use it also we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="808.44" dur="5.21">see the African nations decide to use</text>
  <text start="810.6" dur="6.57">this and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a huge shift</text>
  <text start="813.65" dur="6.07">from the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="817.17" dur="4.68">system over to this new system other</text>
  <text start="819.72" dur="6.63">countries right now they are</text>
  <text start="821.85" dur="6.39">transitioning away from the u.s. system</text>
  <text start="826.35" dur="3.93">now remember this is not a let&amp;#39;s not get</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="4.74">confused here this is not a people</text>
  <text start="830.28" dur="7.98">system remember the system that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="832.98" dur="6.39">today is a central bank system the paper</text>
  <text start="838.26" dur="4.29">money that you hold</text>
  <text start="839.37" dur="6.27">they are notes given to you by the</text>
  <text start="842.55" dur="6.27">central bank the Federal Reserve it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="845.64" dur="5.91">not from our government it&amp;#39;s not from</text>
  <text start="848.82" dur="5.65">the people we didn&amp;#39;t create the currency</text>
  <text start="851.55" dur="5.41">it&amp;#39;s coming from a private corporation</text>
  <text start="854.47" dur="6.39">countries around the world are moving</text>
  <text start="856.96" dur="5.67">away from this central bank no and I</text>
  <text start="860.86" dur="3.78">think this is why Trump and his</text>
  <text start="862.63" dur="4.7">administration the Patriots are moving</text>
  <text start="864.64" dur="7.26">so quickly to get out of all of these</text>
  <text start="867.33" dur="8.8">globalist deals these trade systems and</text>
  <text start="871.9" dur="8.04">move away and into the bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="876.13" dur="5.46">agreements and remember they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="879.94" dur="3.03">this as fast as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="881.59" dur="3.99">because they know what&amp;#39;s coming they</text>
  <text start="882.97" dur="5.22">know that this system is one gigantic</text>
  <text start="885.58" dur="5.49">illusion Trump before he was president</text>
  <text start="888.19" dur="5.58">he set it right out it&amp;#39;s false it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="891.07" dur="5.49">false economy when he became president</text>
  <text start="893.77" dur="5.73">he realized that he had to use the</text>
  <text start="896.56" dur="5.19">weapons against the central bankers</text>
  <text start="899.5" dur="4.92">against the deep state and show that the</text>
  <text start="901.75" dur="4.32">economy was actually doing well and it</text>
  <text start="904.42" dur="5.58">allows him to do many different things</text>
  <text start="906.07" dur="6.15">it allows him to negotiate trade deals</text>
  <text start="910" dur="4.65">it shows the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="912.22" dur="4.74">economy&amp;#39;s doing well the deep state has</text>
  <text start="914.65" dur="3.96">a very difficult time fighting against</text>
  <text start="916.96" dur="2.79">that saying that oh because of his</text>
  <text start="918.61" dur="2.52">tariffs because of what he&amp;#39;s doing with</text>
  <text start="919.75" dur="3.45">the trade deals because what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="921.13" dur="3.24">with all this stuff he&amp;#39;s responsible for</text>
  <text start="923.2" dur="3.69">the economy doing poorly</text>
  <text start="924.37" dur="3.96">so remember he needed the economy to</text>
  <text start="926.89" dur="4.53">look fantastic</text>
  <text start="928.33" dur="5.7">so behind the scenes he can change</text>
  <text start="931.42" dur="5.7">everything without the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="934.03" dur="6.09">the deep state harping on how he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="937.12" dur="7.11">destroying the economy he kind of used</text>
  <text start="940.12" dur="5.94">their weapons against them and the rest</text>
  <text start="944.23" dur="5.04">of the world is transitioning actually</text>
  <text start="946.06" dur="5.34">the United States we are transitioning</text>
  <text start="949.27" dur="3.99">right now a lot of people don&amp;#39;t see this</text>
  <text start="951.4" dur="4.59">I mean a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t see it in</text>
  <text start="953.26" dur="4.77">the 70s they didn&amp;#39;t see the transition</text>
  <text start="955.99" dur="4.23">from a gold standard to a petro dollar</text>
  <text start="958.03" dur="4.32">standard and the big changes that were</text>
  <text start="960.22" dur="4.26">coming where the central bank they</text>
  <text start="962.35" dur="3.81">didn&amp;#39;t have any more checks and balances</text>
  <text start="964.48" dur="4.23">they have nothing and the government had</text>
  <text start="966.16" dur="7.08">no more checks and balances so right now</text>
  <text start="968.71" dur="7.49">we are in the middle of a transition the</text>
  <text start="973.24" dur="5.82">economy is turning very rapidly</text>
  <text start="976.2" dur="6.76">countries are now turning to new systems</text>
  <text start="979.06" dur="6.21">and it&amp;#39;s all happening at once and a lot</text>
  <text start="982.96" dur="4.86">of people don&amp;#39;t even realize it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="985.27" dur="3.559">happening and this is why once we get to</text>
  <text start="987.82" dur="2.9">that</text>
  <text start="988.829" dur="3.481">where the economy starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="990.72" dur="4.799">and the market comes down and we have</text>
  <text start="992.31" dur="5.91">problems yes we&amp;#39;re gonna have very bumpy</text>
  <text start="995.519" dur="4.711">roads and hopefully it&amp;#39;s not for a very</text>
  <text start="998.22" dur="4.5">long time hopefully they have different</text>
  <text start="1000.23" dur="4.979">mechanisms in place to bring us out of</text>
  <text start="1002.72" dur="4.739">this into the new system but we know</text>
  <text start="1005.209" dur="5.011">that for a certain period of time we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1007.459" dur="5.911">going to have to manage this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1010.22" dur="5.25">gonna have to prepare ourselves to get</text>
  <text start="1013.37" dur="5.49">through this area just like Russia had</text>
  <text start="1015.47" dur="6.029">to do just like Argentina Venezuela and</text>
  <text start="1018.86" dur="5.88">many and Germany back you know in the</text>
  <text start="1021.499" dur="5.34">20s and 30s we all have to do the same</text>
  <text start="1024.74" dur="5.549">exact thing because you&amp;#39;re moving from</text>
  <text start="1026.839" dur="5.161">one system into another and yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1030.289" dur="3.241">going to see inflation yes we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1032" dur="3.089">see credit freezes we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot</text>
  <text start="1033.53" dur="3.21">of these different things and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1035.089" dur="4.2">you need to be prepared and ready for</text>
