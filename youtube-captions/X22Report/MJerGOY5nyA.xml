  <text start="60.9" dur="5.73">May 10th 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="63.75" dur="4.8">episode is Trump confirms the economy</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="5.099">will be brought down and it will be</text>
  <text start="68.55" dur="5.64">chaotic let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="4.561">collapse financial news now today I</text>
  <text start="74.19" dur="5.16">wanted to start off by saying I need</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="4.56">everyone if you want the full story of</text>
  <text start="79.35" dur="3.33">what is going on and I&amp;#39;ve been doing a</text>
  <text start="80.85" dur="5.22">lot of research to see what Trump has</text>
  <text start="82.68" dur="6.21">been doing and it is perfectly clear on</text>
  <text start="86.07" dur="4.77">exactly what he has planned and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="4.31">going to be laying this out in the a</text>
  <text start="90.84" dur="4.71">report and in the B report and</text>
  <text start="93.2" dur="5.29">everything that he&amp;#39;s planning right now</text>
  <text start="95.55" dur="5.67">is not for right now it&amp;#39;s for after the</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="4.92">collapse and North Korea is not what you</text>
  <text start="101.22" dur="4.649">think what is happening around the world</text>
  <text start="103.41" dur="4.05">and what he&amp;#39;s doing right now well I</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="3.39">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of confusion out</text>
  <text start="107.46" dur="4.769">there but you&amp;#39;re gonna have to bear with</text>
  <text start="109.259" dur="5.401">me and the picture will become very</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="6.75">clear as we go through both of these</text>
  <text start="114.66" dur="7.23">reports and all of this has always meant</text>
  <text start="118.979" dur="5.67">to be for everyone to be prepared and</text>
  <text start="121.89" dur="5.819">ready for the system crashing just like</text>
  <text start="124.649" dur="5.58">in 2008 where the system was crumbling</text>
  <text start="127.709" dur="4.321">apart and falling apart and if the</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="3.241">central bank didn&amp;#39;t step in and create</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="4.56">this gigantic illusion that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="4.32">in for last 8 9 years the whole system</text>
  <text start="136.59" dur="4.59">would have just fallen apart at that</text>
  <text start="137.79" dur="7.02">point now we&amp;#39;ve been built up and this</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="5.52">illusion has grown so big that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="4.259">only one way out of this and that is a</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="5.34">complete collapse of the system and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="149.069" dur="5.911">been doing all of this to make sure that</text>
  <text start="152.04" dur="9.69">I could get as many people as I possibly</text>
  <text start="154.98" dur="9.81">can to get prepared for the system</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="5.07">collapsing because I don&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="4.98">to go through what everyone has gone</text>
  <text start="166.8" dur="5.189">through in 2008 now many people haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="169.77" dur="3.87">gone through anything in 2008 and then</text>
  <text start="171.989" dur="6.571">there&amp;#39;s those that have gone through</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="6.959">hell in 2008 and actually in 2009 2010</text>
  <text start="178.56" dur="5.549">and they never really recovered this</text>
  <text start="180.599" dur="4.801">time around it is going to be so much</text>
  <text start="184.109" dur="3.3">worse</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="3.6">and we&amp;#39;ve been following this for a very</text>
  <text start="187.409" dur="4.28">long time because I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to</text>
  <text start="189" dur="5.34">be surprised about what is coming and</text>
  <text start="191.689" dur="6.19">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at every part of the</text>
  <text start="194.34" dur="6.3">economy and I think at this point Trump</text>
  <text start="197.879" dur="4.44">has realized that he cannot negotiate</text>
  <text start="200.64" dur="4.14">with the deep state he cannot negotiate</text>
  <text start="202.319" dur="3.54">with the central bank and from the</text>
  <text start="204.78" dur="3.569">research and everything I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="205.859" dur="5.66">looking at the picture has become very</text>
  <text start="208.349" dur="5.431">very clear in what he plans to do and</text>
  <text start="211.519" dur="4.511">we&amp;#39;re going to go through all of this</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="4.98">and I want you to listen to Part A and</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="6.629">Part B so you can get a complete picture</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="7.349">of what is happening now we know that</text>
  <text start="222.659" dur="5.011">the real estate market it is collapsing</text>
  <text start="226.109" dur="2.49">right in front of us and I know people</text>
  <text start="227.67" dur="2.25">don&amp;#39;t believe this</text>
  <text start="228.599" dur="4.321">I know people are out there saying well</text>
  <text start="229.92" dur="5.64">my area people are selling their house</text>
  <text start="232.92" dur="5.489">like crazy yes and all of this is going</text>
  <text start="235.56" dur="5.549">to end very very soon because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.409" dur="5.491">seeing in many of these hotspots and I</text>
  <text start="241.109" dur="4.291">have my hands up in air quotes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="2.789">starting to see things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="4.709">falling apart just like we did back in</text>
  <text start="246.689" dur="6.63">2008 now we know Miami and many of the</text>
  <text start="250.109" dur="6.331">other cities they were propped up after</text>
  <text start="253.319" dur="6.39">2008 and they use these cities in these</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="5.669">areas to make it seem like the real</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="5.27">estate market was coming back now andrew</text>
  <text start="262.109" dur="6.391">stearns founder of star funding is</text>
  <text start="264.979" dur="5.531">analyzing the condo market in miami and</text>
  <text start="268.5" dur="3.69">when you look at Miami&amp;#39;s he cranes all</text>
  <text start="270.51" dur="3.24">over the place and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.19" dur="4.17">building like crazy which they are and</text>
  <text start="273.75" dur="5.33">it reminds me of 2008 I remember</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="4.739">visiting Florida and seeing this and</text>
  <text start="279.08" dur="5.05">everything came to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="281.099" dur="8.011">well he&amp;#39;s been analyzing the brick el</text>
  <text start="284.13" dur="8.25">condo area and he&amp;#39;s looking at this and</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="5.809">he&amp;#39;s saying that well a lot of the</text>
  <text start="292.38" dur="6.3">condos that are being sold right now are</text>
  <text start="294.919" dur="4.93">being sold to speculators those people</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="3.78">who like to get in pre-construction</text>
  <text start="299.849" dur="6.06">prices and then they flip him right away</text>
  <text start="302.46" dur="6.269">and almost half of the building well is</text>
  <text start="305.909" dur="4.5">basically being sold to these</text>
  <text start="308.729" dur="6.571">speculators just like we saw back in</text>
  <text start="310.409" dur="7.531">2008 what he is found is that these</text>
  <text start="315.3" dur="7.11">speculators they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="317.94" dur="8.91">sell the units most of them the majority</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="8.04">of them are up for sale and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.85" dur="7.65">get rid of them there&amp;#39;s no one coming to</text>
  <text start="330.45" dur="6.84">purchase them so he looked around and</text>
  <text start="334.5" dur="4.68">said okay what is going on here and he</text>

  <text start="408.8" dur="8.17">coming on to the market and the demand</text>
  <text start="412.56" dur="6.99">it&amp;#39;s not there and this is leading us</text>
  <text start="416.97" dur="6.33">into the same situation that happened</text>
  <text start="419.55" dur="6.75">back in 2008 this is going to be a</text>

  <text start="437.07" dur="5.61">because the oil producing cartel is</text>
  <text start="439.64" dur="5.38">seeking to control the wrong thing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="6.93">not a matter of supply but global demand</text>
  <text start="445.02" dur="6.7">which is simply not there the demand for</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="5.56">oil it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="486.49" dur="3.75">to freeze up and people are not going to</text>
  <text start="488.71" dur="3.69">be able to get any supplies whatsoever</text>
  <text start="490.24" dur="4.62">because trucking is going to stop train</text>
  <text start="492.4" dur="4.89">movements going to stop supplies heading</text>
  <text start="494.86" dur="5.37">into the supermarkets they are going to</text>
  <text start="497.29" dur="4.74">stop and people are going to be very</text>
  <text start="500.23" dur="4.35">very worried and scared of what is</text>
  <text start="502.03" dur="5.94">happening here which means that oil is</text>
  <text start="504.58" dur="5.85">also not going to reach the country</text>
  <text start="507.97" dur="7.46">which is not going to reach the gas</text>
  <text start="510.43" dur="7.979">stations and this is a major problem now</text>
  <text start="515.43" dur="5.08">we see all of this happening at the same</text>
  <text start="518.409" dur="4.56">time now the central bank is on track to</text>
  <text start="520.51" dur="5.7">raise rates once again now I said this</text>
  <text start="522.969" dur="5.491">in the past that Trump is trying to</text>
  <text start="526.21" dur="4.95">bring down the economy the central bank</text>
  <text start="528.46" dur="5.97">is doing the same exact thing now</text>
  <text start="531.16" dur="7.5">yesterday we reported that Comey was</text>
  <text start="534.43" dur="8.1">fired what Trump was trying to do he was</text>
  <text start="538.66" dur="5.64">trying to work with the deep state to</text>
  <text start="542.53" dur="4.68">basically bring down the economy and</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="4.53">make it not so bad for everyone and he</text>
  <text start="547.21" dur="3.72">was trying to negotiate all these</text>
  <text start="548.83" dur="4.32">different in all these different areas</text>
  <text start="550.93" dur="4.26">and it didn&amp;#39;t work out so he decided you</text>
  <text start="553.15" dur="5.64">know something he&amp;#39;s done with it</text>
  <text start="555.19" dur="6.24">and already we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="558.79" dur="5.58">changing dramatically since the firing</text>
  <text start="561.43" dur="4.47">of combing the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="564.37" dur="2.43">there saying that Trump&amp;#39;s decision to</text>
  <text start="565.9" dur="4.56">terminate Comey</text>
  <text start="566.8" dur="6.09">well it&amp;#39;s going to have an effect on the</text>
  <text start="570.46" dur="7.14">economy because it&amp;#39;s going to delay his</text>
  <text start="572.89" dur="7.26">economic reforms schedule and already</text>
  <text start="577.6" dur="5.06">they&amp;#39;re saying that because of what he</text>
  <text start="580.15" dur="4.71">did the economy is going to be</text>
  <text start="582.66" dur="6.6">collapsing it&amp;#39;s going to be falling</text>
  <text start="584.86" dur="7.65">apart now Trump to counter this and</text>
  <text start="589.26" dur="6.82">we&amp;#39;ve really never seen a president do</text>
  <text start="592.51" dur="7.41">this he&amp;#39;s come out and he said and his</text>
  <text start="596.08" dur="7.83">administration that says that a 3% GDP</text>
  <text start="599.92" dur="6.18">growth it&amp;#39;s not achievable this year now</text>
  <text start="603.91" dur="4.29">we knew this from the beginning we knew</text>
  <text start="606.1" dur="7.02">that there&amp;#39;s no way that he was going to</text>
  <text start="608.2" dur="8.31">reach 3% GDP what he&amp;#39;s actually saying</text>
  <text start="613.12" dur="6.36">right now is that the economy is not</text>
  <text start="616.51" dur="6.33">going to be growing at all he&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="619.48" dur="5.03">come out after he was present operated</text>
  <text start="622.84" dur="4.82">that the economy is a mess</text>
  <text start="624.51" dur="6.67">now they&amp;#39;re saying well if he gets his</text>
  <text start="627.66" dur="5.56">taxes is trade and energy policies and</text>
  <text start="631.18" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re all fully in place which we know</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="4.89">this is not going to happen then maybe</text>
  <text start="635.56" dur="3.93">the economy can survive and we know this</text>
  <text start="638.11" dur="4.62">will not happen at this point</text>
  <text start="639.49" dur="6.51">he knows it to what he&amp;#39;s signaling right</text>
  <text start="642.73" dur="7.65">now is that the economy is collapsing</text>
  <text start="646" dur="6.81">he&amp;#39;s going to force it to collapse now</text>
  <text start="650.38" dur="5.28">the central bank they are working as</text>
  <text start="652.81" dur="6">hard as they possibly can to collapse</text>
  <text start="655.66" dur="5.91">the economy at the same time because</text>
  <text start="658.81" dur="6.12">whoever wins and this is really not</text>
  <text start="661.57" dur="5.61">winning but whoever is the leader and</text>
  <text start="664.93" dur="5.34">the one that actually crashes the</text>
  <text start="667.18" dur="6.86">economy they will be able to control the</text>
  <text start="670.27" dur="5.87">situation now Trump his plan and</text>
  <text start="674.04" dur="5.2">everything that he&amp;#39;s doing right now is</text>
  <text start="676.14" dur="6.31">not for now it&amp;#39;s for after the collapse</text>
  <text start="679.24" dur="8.85">this collapse coming up is going to be a</text>
  <text start="682.45" dur="8.58">hard hitting collapse and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="688.09" dur="5.58">be very very chaotic and he understands</text>
  <text start="691.03" dur="4.97">that afterwards he needs to put certain</text>
  <text start="693.67" dur="4.59">things in place what do I mean by this</text>
  <text start="696" dur="6.04">well think about it</text>
  <text start="698.26" dur="5.79">when the system comes down the dollar</text>
  <text start="702.04" dur="3.72">will no longer be the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="704.05" dur="5.31">in the world and I&amp;#39;ve said this before</text>
  <text start="705.76" dur="6.84">which means the trade with other</text>
  <text start="709.36" dur="8.22">countries where they take the dollars</text>

  <text start="739.2" dur="4.92">natural resources like gold and silver</text>
  <text start="741.67" dur="5.64">this is why he put these reviews up</text>
  <text start="744.12" dur="6.91">because he understands that the country</text>
  <text start="747.31" dur="5.19">is going to have to be independent from</text>
  <text start="751.03" dur="3.66">the rest of the world because we&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="757.87" dur="4.68">China that&amp;#39;s going to come to a</text>
  <text start="759.64" dur="6.57">screeching halt for a period of time and</text>
  <text start="762.55" dur="6.03">he realizes this and the people in his</text>
  <text start="766.21" dur="7.44">administration who were behind all this</text>
  <text start="768.58" dur="7.26">realize this and the whole process that</text>
  <text start="773.65" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;re going through right now is to</text>
  <text start="775.84" dur="8.16">prepare the country for this now this is</text>
  <text start="779.56" dur="9.3">not going to be an easy time for anyone</text>
  <text start="784" dur="9.09">it&amp;#39;s going to affect almost every single</text>
  <text start="788.86" dur="7.26">person and if you haven&amp;#39;t been watching</text>
  <text start="793.09" dur="8.46">listening and preparing it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="796.12" dur="6.39">affect you not in a good way what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="801.55" dur="3.21">been doing here</text>
  <text start="802.51" dur="4.68">for the last couple of years is getting</text>
  <text start="804.76" dur="5.84">everyone ready and prepared for this</text>
  <text start="807.19" dur="7.05">moment and this moment is going to be a</text>
  <text start="810.6" dur="8.41">hard-hitting collapse and when I say get</text>
  <text start="814.24" dur="7.23">prepared I mean get prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="819.01" dur="6.09">coming and you&amp;#39;ll understand this in</text>
  <text start="821.47" dur="6.51">report B of what he&amp;#39;s trying to do here</text>
  <text start="825.1" dur="6.48">and what he&amp;#39;s planning to do here but</text>
  <text start="827.98" dur="5.79">what I&amp;#39;m saying right now is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="831.58" dur="7.56">going to be very difficult to get food</text>
  <text start="833.77" dur="8.1">clothing water gas those type of things</text>
  <text start="839.14" dur="4.83">for a certain period of time the</text>
  <text start="841.87" dur="3.18">currency in the bank and think about</text>
  <text start="843.97" dur="3.6">what just happened because yes they</text>
  <text start="845.05" dur="6.25">reported on it JP Morgan is worried is</text>
  <text start="847.57" dur="7.92">warning about a drain of deposits</text>
  <text start="851.3" dur="6.21">come at coming at the end of this year I</text>
  <text start="855.49" dur="6.78">mean I should tell you something right</text>
  <text start="857.51" dur="7.2">there and you need to be ready because</text>
  <text start="862.27" dur="4.6">when they say a drain of the deposits</text>
  <text start="864.71" dur="5.82">that means the currency in the banking</text>
  <text start="866.87" dur="5.7">system is going to be gone that those</text>
  <text start="870.53" dur="4.47">funds in the bank are going to be gone</text>
  <text start="872.57" dur="5.9">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what bank you&amp;#39;re in it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="875" dur="6.06">going to hit pretty much all of them and</text>
  <text start="878.47" dur="5.05">you need to have some of this paper</text>
  <text start="881.06" dur="3.84">currency on hand right now now why do</text>
  <text start="883.52" dur="4.68">you need some of the paper currency</text>
  <text start="884.9" dur="5.67">because in the beginning during the</text>
  <text start="888.2" dur="5.73">first couple of days of the first couple</text>
  <text start="890.57" dur="5.82">of weeks people will then trade with</text>
  <text start="893.93" dur="4.53">this currency they will trade and let</text>
  <text start="896.39" dur="3.41">you purchase certain things now most</text>
  <text start="898.46" dur="3.93">likely it&amp;#39;s not going to be cheap</text>
  <text start="899.8" dur="5.53">because the currency is going to lose</text>
  <text start="902.39" dur="4.98">value very very quickly and they will</text>
  <text start="905.33" dur="4.26">allow you they will allow you to use</text>
  <text start="907.37" dur="4.29">this currency for a certain period of</text>
  <text start="909.59" dur="4.29">time because until it&amp;#39;s worth absolutely</text>
  <text start="911.66" dur="6.42">nothing just like in the Weimar Republic</text>
  <text start="913.88" dur="5.87">in Germany and Zimbabwe where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.08" dur="4.98">eventually going to have to go to a</text>
  <text start="919.75" dur="5.2">store or an individual that has products</text>
  <text start="923.06" dur="3.78">saying okay I&amp;#39;m going to need you know a</text>
  <text start="924.95" dur="4.59">hundred thousand dollars for this bread</text>
  <text start="926.84" dur="5.01">and of course you&amp;#39;re not going to most</text>
  <text start="929.54" dur="4.59">likely have it because the currency will</text>
  <text start="931.85" dur="5.64">be worth absolutely nothing but I will</text>
  <text start="934.13" dur="5.94">take maybe a tenth of silver because at</text>
  <text start="937.49" dur="4.86">that point in time gold and silver will</text>
  <text start="940.07" dur="4.32">start to rise now you don&amp;#39;t want to use</text>
  <text start="942.35" dur="3.33">your gold and you don&amp;#39;t want to use your</text>
  <text start="944.39" dur="3.84">silver dollars you probably want to use</text>
  <text start="945.68" dur="4.68">a lot of these smaller denominations of</text>
  <text start="948.23" dur="4.26">silver for this type of trade now you</text>
  <text start="950.36" dur="4.71">can even probably at this point use a</text>
  <text start="952.49" dur="6.78">bordering system I have toilet paper I</text>
  <text start="955.07" dur="5.73">need food let&amp;#39;s swap but in the</text>
  <text start="959.27" dur="4.77">beginning you will need the currency</text>
  <text start="960.8" dur="5.82">then it will slowly change to maybe</text>
  <text start="964.04" dur="5.85">bartering and then silver and gold as</text>
  <text start="966.62" dur="5.94">that increases in value and people say</text>
  <text start="969.89" dur="5.79">okay you know something this is what we</text>
  <text start="972.56" dur="6">need to use now the government is going</text>
  <text start="975.68" dur="4.98">to be shrunken down people are going to</text>
  <text start="978.56" dur="4.86">lose their jobs like crazy we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="980.66" dur="4.14">all these different departments the</text>
  <text start="983.42" dur="3.69">entitlement programs are going</text>
  <text start="984.8" dur="7.229">go away everyone&amp;#39;s going to have to fend</text>
  <text start="987.11" dur="10.409">for themselves and at this point this is</text>
  <text start="992.029" dur="7.74">when the chaos begins and as the chaos</text>
  <text start="997.519" dur="5.461">begins people are going to become very</text>
  <text start="999.769" dur="6.931">very desperate it&amp;#39;s not going to happen</text>
  <text start="1002.98" dur="5.43">right away everyone will be in a good</text>
  <text start="1006.7" dur="2.72">mood or a little bit of worried and</text>
  <text start="1008.41" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;ll be talking to their neighbors</text>
  <text start="1009.42" dur="6.52">but as time goes on and people run out</text>
  <text start="1012.25" dur="5.19">of supplies you know the food or toilet</text>

  <text start="1032.829" dur="3.841">things get out of hand</text>
