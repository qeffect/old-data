  <text start="170.98" dur="5.5">from all that we&amp;#39;ve seen and everything</text>
  <text start="174.409" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s been happening our government</text>
  <text start="176.48" dur="8.52">officials have continually reminded us</text>
  <text start="179.389" dur="9.99">of what a cyber 911 a virtual Pearl</text>
  <text start="185" dur="7.079">Harbor whereas so we know that they are</text>
  <text start="189.379" dur="5.28">planning to do something we know that</text>
  <text start="192.079" dur="4.83">something is happening and in the past</text>
  <text start="194.659" dur="5.101">couple of months they&amp;#39;ve been showing us</text>
  <text start="196.909" dur="4.86">these cyber attacks against target</text>
  <text start="199.76" dur="4.47">Neiman Marcus of course they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="201.769" dur="5.101">using this to create their executive</text>
  <text start="204.23" dur="4.259">orders and gets em to get sista past but</text>
  <text start="206.87" dur="5.579">they have also been letting the public</text>
  <text start="208.489" dur="6.301">know that we are vulnerable to this type</text>
  <text start="212.449" dur="5.311">of an attack and we understand that the</text>
  <text start="214.79" dur="6.24">stock market the bat system the Nasdaq</text>
  <text start="217.76" dur="5.729">all have kill switches implemented at</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="4.829">this time so when the market comes down</text>
  <text start="223.489" dur="4.53">they will have the ability to stop it</text>
  <text start="225.859" dur="4.44">and right now this report is out there</text>
  <text start="228.019" dur="4.83">and it&amp;#39;s saying that you can expect</text>
  <text start="230.299" dur="3.78">something big to happen and this is what</text>
  <text start="232.849" dur="3.991">we&amp;#39;ve been telling everyone to prepare</text>
  <text start="234.079" dur="7.201">not to keep that much money in the bank</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="7.139">and again this is my personal opinion I</text>
  <text start="241.28" dur="5.789">try only to keep what I need in there to</text>
  <text start="243.979" dur="5.19">pay bills and that is it the rest is in</text>
  <text start="247.069" dur="4.32">physical assets because the cyber attack</text>
  <text start="249.169" dur="4.65">can not hit you know can&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="251.389" dur="5.22">the physical asset and if you have your</text>
  <text start="253.819" dur="4.741">money your currency in your hands you</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="3.511">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about that and we</text>
  <text start="258.56" dur="3">understand what they need to do because</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="4.289">we understand that the economy is</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="4.289">completely crumbling apart it is falling</text>
  <text start="264.409" dur="3.331">apart right in front of our eyes and we</text>
  <text start="265.849" dur="4.081">see what&amp;#39;s happening around the world</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="4.5">there are countries and central banks</text>
  <text start="269.93" dur="3.599">that are removing the dollar from</text>
  <text start="272.24" dur="3.389">reserves and there</text>
  <text start="273.529" dur="4.86">adding other currencies like the yuan</text>
  <text start="275.629" dur="5.43">renminbi China is out there making deals</text>
  <text start="278.389" dur="5.31">all over the place we see UK just became</text>
  <text start="281.059" dur="4.95">a clearinghouse for the one slash</text>
  <text start="283.699" dur="3.87">renminbi we understand that New Zealand</text>
  <text start="286.009" dur="4.86">has bilateral trade agreements with</text>
  <text start="287.569" dur="5.88">China and China is continually doing</text>
  <text start="290.869" dur="4.92">this around the world and we realized</text>
  <text start="293.449" dur="5.19">the private western central bankers do</text>
  <text start="295.789" dur="4.8">not like this this is a direct threat</text>
  <text start="298.639" dur="4.68">and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been placing</text>
  <text start="300.589" dur="5.16">their military assets all around the</text>
  <text start="303.319" dur="4.83">world encircling Russia and China and</text>
  <text start="305.749" dur="5.4">containing them and we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="308.149" dur="5.52">into a little bit more about this cyber</text>
  <text start="311.149" dur="4.29">attack on these bank accounts a little</text>
  <text start="313.669" dur="3.93">bit later in this report but let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="315.439" dur="4.05">into the economic collapse news and what</text>
  <text start="317.599" dur="3.21">are we seeing right now well of course</text>
  <text start="319.489" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re coming out and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="320.809" dur="4.17">continuing with their illusions letting</text>
  <text start="322.939" dur="4.38">us know that the economy is recovering</text>
  <text start="324.979" dur="4.8">and we feel that everything is getting</text>
  <text start="327.319" dur="6.93">better and right now us factory orders</text>
  <text start="329.779" dur="8.4">are doing better than they expected but</text>
  <text start="334.249" dur="6.51">of course if you remove the defense</text>
  <text start="338.179" dur="4.53">orders actually factory orders to climb</text>
  <text start="340.759" dur="3.96">by point one percent but of course when</text>
  <text start="342.709" dur="5.1">you include it it looks like they have</text>
  <text start="344.719" dur="4.98">gone up to 0.7% so really what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.809" dur="4.051">happening here they are manipulating</text>
  <text start="349.699" dur="3.93">numbers putting things in there making</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="4.949">it look like we are doing much much</text>
  <text start="353.629" dur="5.36">better than we really are and right now</text>
  <text start="356.809" dur="6.14">what is happening the major financial</text>
  <text start="358.989" dur="6.88">institutions are now shorting Treasuries</text>
  <text start="362.949" dur="6.4">institutional clients have not been this</text>
  <text start="365.869" dur="5.88">short on Treasuries since 2006 JP</text>
  <text start="369.349" dur="4.83">Morgan&amp;#39;s clients survey exposes as the</text>
  <text start="371.749" dur="5.1">end of this last week active clients</text>
  <text start="374.179" dur="4.41">were adding to their shorts now hmmm I</text>
  <text start="376.849" dur="5.1">wonder why they&amp;#39;re doing this because we</text>
  <text start="378.589" dur="6.36">see China we see Russia and other</text>
  <text start="381.949" dur="5.28">nations selling their Treasury bonds and</text>
  <text start="384.949" dur="4.89">we see Belgium or a private institution</text>
  <text start="387.229" dur="4.98">with in Belgium purchasing these</text>
  <text start="389.839" dur="6.06">Treasury bonds they are picking up the</text>
  <text start="392.209" dur="5.31">slack for the Fed of course the Fed here</text>
  <text start="395.899" dur="3.51">in the United States has to show us that</text>
  <text start="397.519" dur="4.14">you know we&amp;#39;re in a recovery more</text>
  <text start="399.409" dur="4.98">tapering we&amp;#39;re no we&amp;#39;re no longer doing</text>
  <text start="401.659" dur="4.26">this stimulus but in reality they really</text>
  <text start="404.389" dur="3.211">are all they&amp;#39;re doing is channeling</text>
  <text start="405.919" dur="3.421">money to other places</text>
  <text start="407.6" dur="3.96">and they&amp;#39;re picking up the slack but</text>
  <text start="409.34" dur="5.31">they need to keep everyone in the dark</text>
  <text start="411.56" dur="5.88">they have to make sure that you believe</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="5.76">we are in some type of recovery now we</text>
  <text start="417.44" dur="5.28">understand that Congress definitely does</text>

  <text start="450.83" dur="6.87">first time that had happened in you has</text>
  <text start="453.98" dur="5.37">history at this time and again when we</text>
  <text start="457.7" dur="3.9">look at government it was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="459.35" dur="5.79">a mixture of the people they were</text>
