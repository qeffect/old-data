  <text start="55.91" dur="5.64">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.32" dur="7.409">episode 1526 bien today&amp;#39;s date is March</text>
  <text start="61.55" dur="6.69">20th 2018 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.729" dur="7.14">is stage is set the push for regulations</text>
  <text start="68.24" dur="5.37">and I boar begins let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.869" dur="3.961">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="73.61" dur="4.53">geopolitical news now yesterday we</text>
  <text start="75.83" dur="5.76">talked about Facebook and how they</text>
  <text start="78.14" dur="6.17">banned Cambridge analytic up from</text>
  <text start="81.59" dur="4.949">getting any more data from Facebook and</text>
  <text start="84.31" dur="3.699">they said that you know they help the</text>
  <text start="86.539" dur="4.051">Trump campaign and they&amp;#39;re not allowed</text>
  <text start="88.009" dur="6.541">to use their data anymore it violated</text>
  <text start="90.59" dur="6.44">their policies now the FTC is probing</text>
  <text start="94.55" dur="5.04">Facebook for use of personal data the</text>
  <text start="97.03" dur="4.449">investigation involves whether allowed</text>
  <text start="99.59" dur="5.029">Cambridge analytical to receive some</text>
  <text start="101.479" dur="6.901">user data in violation of its policies</text>
  <text start="104.619" dur="7.991">now the problem is Facebook not</text>
  <text start="108.38" dur="7.29">Cambridge analytical and once again</text>
  <text start="112.61" dur="5.61">there was an individual Alexander Cogan</text>
  <text start="115.67" dur="4.11">who created the app back in 2014 the app</text>
  <text start="118.22" dur="5.569">was not allowed to use the data for</text>
  <text start="119.78" dur="7.89">commercial purposes and we can see that</text>
  <text start="123.789" dur="6.571">the Trump campaign used the Facebook</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="5.37">user data harvested through the app and</text>
  <text start="130.36" dur="4.87">the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="133.04" dur="4.44">Facebook is out there saying that you</text>
  <text start="135.23" dur="4.77">know they did this illegally it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="137.48" dur="5.729">against their policies this is why they</text>
  <text start="140" dur="7.349">ban them but if you look back in time</text>
  <text start="143.209" dur="6.331">back in 2012 Obama&amp;#39;s team they gathered</text>
  <text start="147.349" dur="8.701">Adil&amp;#39;s of data on potential supporters</text>
  <text start="149.54" dur="11.25">and they did this by mining Facebook</text>
  <text start="156.05" dur="7.26">data they used sharing targeted sharing</text>
  <text start="160.79" dur="5.369">protocols and they mined</text>
  <text start="163.31" dur="4.56">Facebook&amp;#39;s network in search of friends</text>
  <text start="166.159" dur="5.281">that campaign wanted to register</text>
  <text start="167.87" dur="5.759">mobilize or persuade to do this the</text>
  <text start="171.44" dur="3.96">protocols would need to use the same</text>
  <text start="173.629" dur="3.75">feature of the Facebook platform for</text>
  <text start="175.4" dur="5.039">developers which was discontinued in</text>
  <text start="177.379" dur="5.461">2015 that allowed apps access to user</text>
  <text start="180.439" dur="5.421">friends profiles with the users consent</text>
  <text start="182.84" dur="5.36">as Facebook invariably points out but</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="4.23">did the Trump campaign need CA and the</text>
  <text start="188.2" dur="4.62">data it required from Cogan to do this</text>
  <text start="190.09" dur="5.88">kind of outreach in 2016</text>
  <text start="192.82" dur="6.92">most likely not but we can see that</text>
  <text start="195.97" dur="6.66">Obama did the same exact thing actually</text>
  <text start="199.74" dur="4.36">Carol Davidson who served as Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.63" dur="4.5">director of interrogation and media</text>
  <text start="204.1" dur="5.4">analytics during his 2012 campaign says</text>
  <text start="207.13" dur="4.92">that she was responsible for the</text>
  <text start="209.5" dur="5.82">optimizer and the narwhal big data</text>
  <text start="212.05" dur="6.39">analytics platform and saying that yeah</text>
  <text start="215.32" dur="5.37">we we did this more than 1 million Obama</text>
  <text start="218.44" dur="5.73">backers who signed up for the Facebook</text>
  <text start="220.69" dur="5.69">based app gave a campaign permission to</text>
  <text start="224.17" dur="5.52">look at their Facebook friends list and</text>
  <text start="226.38" dur="4.24">we see right now they pretty much did</text>
  <text start="229.69" dur="3.24">the same thing now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="230.62" dur="4.47">interesting about this is Facebook&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="4.8">chief security officer has already</text>
  <text start="235.09" dur="7.55">decided to resign and get out of town</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="7.44">now what I see happening right now is</text>
  <text start="242.64" dur="6.34">Facebook is being put into the spotlight</text>
  <text start="245.17" dur="8.97">and it&amp;#39;s being done on purpose we need</text>
  <text start="248.98" dur="7.259">to go back to Q&amp;#39;s posts q post 8 3 9</text>
  <text start="254.14" dur="3.27">where it says do you trust the</text>
  <text start="256.239" dur="4.141">mainstream media</text>
  <text start="257.41" dur="5.04">do you trust Facebook do you trust</text>
  <text start="260.38" dur="5.07">Google do you trust YouTube</text>
  <text start="262.45" dur="6.63">do you trust Twitter and there was</text>
  <text start="265.45" dur="9.84">another post I said set stage set Google</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="9.36">Facebook Twitter etc are regulated and I</text>
  <text start="275.29" dur="5.91">think what was being said there is that</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="7.35">we should not trust these organizations</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="8.19">they need to be regulated and we need</text>
  <text start="285.79" dur="6.42">the Internet Bill of Rights and I think</text>
  <text start="289.39" dur="7.32">Facebook is being thrust out into the</text>
  <text start="292.21" dur="7.709">open to show what was done and how these</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="6.12">political organizations use their data</text>
  <text start="299.919" dur="5.25">and I think this is just the beginning</text>
  <text start="302.83" dur="5.01">and I think this is why there are</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="5.701">certain officers within Facebook that</text>
  <text start="307.84" dur="7.259">are bailing right now we also realize</text>
  <text start="310.87" dur="5.97">that Zuckerberg sold a lot of his shares</text>
  <text start="315.099" dur="3.901">and many other individuals within</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="2.91">Facebook have sold a lot of their shares</text>
  <text start="319" dur="3.09">and because of this</text>
  <text start="319.75" dur="4.83">that came out we see their shares are</text>
  <text start="322.09" dur="5.91">taking a dive and actually Q said some</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="7.02">of these organizations will not survive</text>
  <text start="328" dur="5.49">the regulations and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="331.6" dur="5.43">that I believe this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="333.49" dur="5.79">stages of what they plan to do and I</text>
  <text start="337.03" dur="6.05">think Facebook is the beginning of this</text>
  <text start="339.28" dur="6.72">and it&amp;#39;s gonna you know move into</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="5.05">Twitter it&amp;#39;s gonna move into Google move</text>
  <text start="346" dur="4.17">into YouTube and we&amp;#39;re gonna start to</text>
  <text start="348.13" dur="4.289">hear a lot of news about these</text>
  <text start="350.17" dur="4.29">organizations we&amp;#39;re gonna hear a lot of</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="4.471">news on how they were working with the</text>
  <text start="354.46" dur="4.32">intelligence agencies to develop a lot</text>
  <text start="356.89" dur="4.41">of their algorithms we&amp;#39;re gonna hear a</text>
  <text start="358.78" dur="4.2">lot of information come out and this is</text>
  <text start="361.3" dur="4.05">something that we need to watch and we</text>
  <text start="362.98" dur="4.74">all need to start looking at the</text>
  <text start="365.35" dur="5.1">internet Bill of Rights yes we have the</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="5.13">Bill of Rights which allows us freedom</text>
  <text start="370.45" dur="5.43">of speech freedom of expression freedom</text>
  <text start="372.85" dur="5.91">of the press but with social media today</text>
  <text start="375.88" dur="4.86">with private companies even though the</text>
  <text start="378.76" dur="3.63">public is using them to express</text>
  <text start="380.74" dur="3.929">themselves they&amp;#39;re trying to say that</text>
  <text start="382.39" dur="5.64">this is still private but the majority</text>
  <text start="384.669" dur="6.481">of the public is using this to you know</text>
  <text start="388.03" dur="5.76">express themselves to freely speak and I</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="5.34">think we need another type of Bill of</text>
  <text start="393.79" dur="5.939">Rights for the internet for social media</text>
  <text start="396.49" dur="5.1">to give everyone a voice because once</text>
  <text start="399.729" dur="4.921">these companies start you know shutting</text>
  <text start="401.59" dur="6.6">down certain groups well we have a</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="5.22">problem that&amp;#39;s censorship and we can see</text>
  <text start="408.19" dur="3.9">that if they&amp;#39;re in line with a certain</text>
  <text start="409.87" dur="3.96">group they will do this but the</text>
  <text start="412.09" dur="3.6">platforms have gotten so big and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="413.83" dur="4.589">so many people using it today so many</text>
  <text start="415.69" dur="4.71">groups using it today that under the</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="3.451">Constitution the Bill of Rights everyone</text>
  <text start="420.4" dur="4.56">should have the right to speak freely on</text>
  <text start="421.87" dur="5.43">these platforms and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="424.96" dur="4.17">is something they do not want and I</text>
  <text start="427.3" dur="6.17">think this is the direction that most</text>
  <text start="429.13" dur="7.68">likely we need to go in we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="433.47" dur="6.1">net neutrality which doesn&amp;#39;t mean net</text>
  <text start="436.81" dur="6.18">neutrality all that means is Google</text>
  <text start="439.57" dur="6.27">YouTube Facebook Twitter they would be</text>
  <text start="442.99" dur="5.58">exempt from all the rules and only the</text>
  <text start="445.84" dur="6.509">eyes pea providers would have to obey by</text>
  <text start="448.57" dur="4.51">the rules and the social media Giants</text>
  <text start="452.349" dur="1.991">they</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="2.549">Center and do whatever they want because</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="2.94">they exempt in themselves remember</text>
  <text start="455.629" dur="2.461">they&amp;#39;re the ones who wrote net</text>
  <text start="457.28" dur="2.94">neutrality</text>
  <text start="458.09" dur="4.44">they gave their input of what they</text>
  <text start="460.22" dur="3.479">wanted and the law didn&amp;#39;t even pertain</text>
  <text start="462.53" dur="3.99">to them because they were completely</text>
  <text start="463.699" dur="4.71">exempted from it so we can see what is</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="4.199">happening right now and we need</text>
  <text start="468.409" dur="6.06">something to make sure that the social</text>
  <text start="470.719" dur="6.091">media platforms are equal for every</text>
  <text start="474.469" dur="4.861">single person to speak out now in</text>
  <text start="476.81" dur="5.669">regards to the scrip alloys the</text>
  <text start="479.33" dur="6.149">poisoning we see the British media right</text>
  <text start="482.479" dur="6.391">now is saying that due process does not</text>
  <text start="485.479" dur="6.301">apply to Russia which is just absolutely</text>
  <text start="488.87" dur="6.12">ridiculous and what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="491.78" dur="6.33">that and this is coming from the British</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="6.75">authorities and the British media saying</text>
  <text start="498.11" dur="5.549">that they deny that due process the</text>
  <text start="501.74" dur="4.229">well-established system of rules for</text>
  <text start="503.659" dur="4.29">conducting fair and impartial trials and</text>
  <text start="505.969" dur="4.98">investigations in order to determine</text>
  <text start="507.949" dur="5.34">questions of guilt or innocence are not</text>
  <text start="510.949" dur="5.431">being followed by the British</text>
  <text start="513.289" dur="4.86">authorities in a scribble case so what</text>
  <text start="516.38" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re saying is that Russia can be</text>
  <text start="518.149" dur="5.791">declared guilty without being given the</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="7.35">chance to defend itself so you&amp;#39;re guilty</text>
  <text start="523.94" dur="6.6">until proven is innocent actually in the</text>
  <text start="528.11" dur="4.289">real system you&amp;#39;re innocent until proven</text>
  <text start="530.54" dur="3.72">guilty but they switch it around that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.399" dur="4.111">how it used to be where they threw</text>
  <text start="534.26" dur="4.35">people into prison and you had to fight</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="6.509">your way out of prison which is very</text>
  <text start="538.61" dur="8.43">difficult to do now we can see that the</text>
  <text start="543.019" dur="7.791">British authorities they are violating</text>
  <text start="547.04" dur="5.729">the right of Russia for due process and</text>
  <text start="550.81" dur="4.089">right now the British government is</text>
  <text start="552.769" dur="4.68">interfering in the conduct of criminal</text>
  <text start="554.899" dur="4.68">investigation Prime Minister Theresa May</text>
  <text start="557.449" dur="4.801">and foreign secretary Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="559.579" dur="7.351">pointing fingers at who they say is the</text>
  <text start="562.25" dur="6.57">guilty party without real proof the</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="4.26">British government has said that unless</text>
  <text start="568.82" dur="4.41">Russia proves itself innocent within a</text>
  <text start="571.19" dur="5.43">specific time the British government</text>
  <text start="573.23" dur="5.969">will conclude that it is guilty now</text>
  <text start="576.62" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s absolutely ridiculous in what</text>
  <text start="579.199" dur="4.021">they&amp;#39;re trying to do because they just</text>
  <text start="580.43" dur="5.04">reversed the burden of proof the Bert</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="3.72">the British government refuses to share</text>
  <text start="585.47" dur="4.14">with Russia at the part</text>
  <text start="586.94" dur="5.28">it says is guilty the evidence upon</text>
  <text start="589.61" dur="4.77">which it says it has concluded that</text>
  <text start="592.22" dur="4.35">Russia is guilty because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="594.38" dur="4.62">any there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s nothing that they</text>
  <text start="596.57" dur="4.86">can give to Russia because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="599" dur="5.07">have it they&amp;#39;re just using propaganda</text>
  <text start="601.43" dur="4.74">and this is how propaganda works the</text>
  <text start="604.07" dur="5.19">British government is not following the</text>
  <text start="606.17" dur="5.34">procedure set out an article 9 section 2</text>
  <text start="609.26" dur="4.11">of the Chemical Weapons Convention to</text>
  <text start="611.51" dur="3.78">which both Britain and Russia are</text>
  <text start="613.37" dur="5.37">parties the British authorities are</text>

  <text start="625.73" dur="5.43">criminal assault on their territory due</text>
  <text start="628.55" dur="6.03">process and a criminal investigation is</text>
  <text start="631.16" dur="6.75">not a favor to the fed defendant it is</text>
  <text start="634.58" dur="5.46">the way to arrive at the truth and we</text>
  <text start="637.91" dur="5.61">can see right now because they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="640.04" dur="6.42">propaganda they need to take this tack</text>
  <text start="643.52" dur="4.83">they need to push the idea that Russia</text>
  <text start="646.46" dur="3.84">is just guilty and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="648.35" dur="3.75">what they&amp;#39;re trying to push and it looks</text>
  <text start="650.3" dur="4.71">like they&amp;#39;re trying to push an agenda to</text>
  <text start="652.1" dur="6.39">push Russia over the edge and hopefully</text>
  <text start="655.01" dur="4.62">get into Russia get into war it looks</text>
  <text start="658.49" dur="3.93">like this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="659.63" dur="4.5">and if we go back to World War one it</text>
  <text start="662.42" dur="5.61">looks like they&amp;#39;re trying to use the</text>
  <text start="664.13" dur="8.1">same type of tactics where the Archduke</text>
  <text start="668.03" dur="7.59">Franz Ferdinand was assassinated on June</text>
  <text start="672.23" dur="5.25">28th 1914 and it triggered a chain of</text>
  <text start="675.62" dur="4.17">events that resulted in World War one</text>
  <text start="677.48" dur="4.5">and it looks like this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="679.79" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re trying to do once again hoping</text>
  <text start="681.98" dur="3.9">that this would trigger a war now does</text>
  <text start="684.68" dur="4.8">Russia react like this</text>
  <text start="685.88" dur="5.73">no Russia does not but again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="689.48" dur="3.45">gonna push their agenda very very hard</text>
  <text start="691.61" dur="3.42">because they realize and this is the</text>
  <text start="692.93" dur="4.53">deep state they realize that everything</text>
  <text start="695.03" dur="6.21">is starting to fall apart now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="697.46" dur="8.01">starting to see more wet work and a lot</text>

  <text start="719.63" dur="4.08">and take over Ukraine and of course the</text>
  <text start="721.61" dur="5.79">whole thing didn&amp;#39;t work out because we</text>
  <text start="723.71" dur="6.42">see that Crimea was then voted away from</text>
  <text start="727.4" dur="5.64">Ukraine and the southeastern area of</text>
  <text start="730.13" dur="4.23">Donetsk Lugansk they decided they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="733.04" dur="4.38">want to be part of the new government</text>
  <text start="734.36" dur="6.66">structure so what they tried to do is</text>
  <text start="737.42" dur="5.82">they tried to show the world that the</text>
  <text start="741.02" dur="5.04">individuals in the southeastern part of</text>
  <text start="743.24" dur="7.32">Ukraine they were terrorists and they</text>
  <text start="746.06" dur="7.55">shot down an mh17 Malaysian jet now</text>
  <text start="750.56" dur="7.68">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="753.61" dur="10.09">there was Ukrainian jets flying very</text>
  <text start="758.24" dur="9.6">close to the mh17 passenger jet flight</text>
  <text start="763.7" dur="8.79">number 17 and we know there was a pilot</text>
  <text start="767.84" dur="6.36">that shot at the passenger jet when you</text>
  <text start="772.49" dur="3.75">look at the record you can see the</text>
  <text start="774.2" dur="5.91">bullet holes and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="776.24" dur="7.67">is that the pilot which was accused of</text>
  <text start="780.11" dur="9.27">attacking the mh17 committed suicide</text>
  <text start="783.91" dur="9.4">after all these years for years the</text>
  <text start="789.38" dur="7.38">pilot decided to commit suicide now once</text>
  <text start="793.31" dur="6.48">again we know how Wetwork works where</text>
  <text start="796.76" dur="5.7">they make it look like you know the</text>
  <text start="799.79" dur="5.61">individual committed suicide but it was</text>
  <text start="802.46" dur="6.3">a hit because the pilot was found by his</text>
  <text start="805.4" dur="5.7">29 year old wife she heard the gunshots</text>
  <text start="808.76" dur="5.1">and call the emergency service and it</text>
  <text start="811.1" dur="5.91">looks like the pilot shot himself now</text>
  <text start="813.86" dur="3.78">once again do we know how this really</text>
  <text start="817.01" dur="2.7">went down</text>
  <text start="817.64" dur="4.68">no because we&amp;#39;ve heard this story before</text>
  <text start="819.71" dur="4.89">and it looks like what is happening</text>
  <text start="822.32" dur="4.65">right now through all these false flags</text>
  <text start="824.6" dur="5.28">and events they&amp;#39;re cleaning up those</text>
  <text start="826.97" dur="6.09">people who know things it looks like</text>
  <text start="829.88" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re being removed right now now it</text>
  <text start="833.06" dur="4.59">looks like Trump is going to be mating</text>
  <text start="835.58" dur="5.7">kim jeong-hoon it looks like it might be</text>
  <text start="837.65" dur="6.24">in the DMZ truce village and it looks</text>
  <text start="841.28" dur="5.25">like they&amp;#39;re both going to be getting</text>
  <text start="843.89" dur="4.74">together now this is the village that</text>
  <text start="846.53" dur="5.16">was the site of the 1953 armistice</text>
  <text start="848.63" dur="4.63">agreement where the Korean both Korean</text>
  <text start="851.69" dur="5.44">sides they but they got to get</text>
  <text start="853.26" dur="7.59">and they had a truce and they talked</text>
  <text start="857.13" dur="5.04">about peace and this is where it took</text>
  <text start="860.85" dur="4.74">place and it looks like this is where</text>
  <text start="862.17" dur="5.73">Trump might meet kim jeong-hoon</text>
  <text start="865.59" dur="5.37">now we see the Pentagon is out there</text>
  <text start="867.9" dur="5.88">saying that on April 1st which is April</text>
  <text start="870.96" dur="5.52">Fool&amp;#39;s Day the u.s. and South Korean</text>
  <text start="873.78" dur="4.53">military they&amp;#39;re gonna continue on with</text>
  <text start="876.48" dur="4.89">the exercise that had been postponed</text>
  <text start="878.31" dur="5.73">because of the Winter Olympics now the</text>
  <text start="881.37" dur="4.53">Pentagon said that defense secretary Jim</text>
  <text start="884.04" dur="5.64">mattis and his South Korean counterpart</text>
  <text start="885.9" dur="6.48">Sung Jung mu agreed to go forward with</text>
  <text start="889.68" dur="5.46">the maneuvers known as foul Eagle and</text>
  <text start="892.38" dur="4.8">key resolve now one or two things are</text>
  <text start="895.14" dur="3.81">happening right now this is pure</text>
  <text start="897.18" dur="3.72">propaganda where the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="898.95" dur="7.02">putting out there that this is happening</text>
  <text start="900.9" dur="9.12">or Trump wants to show what he was able</text>
  <text start="905.97" dur="9.45">to do the exercises will go on as</text>
  <text start="910.02" dur="7.95">scheduled and North Korea will not do a</text>
  <text start="915.42" dur="6.51">thing now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="917.97" dur="6.42">that this is taking place on April 1st</text>
  <text start="921.93" dur="5.49">which is April Fool&amp;#39;s Day now the Trump</text>
  <text start="924.39" dur="5.13">have the Pentagon come out there and say</text>
  <text start="927.42" dur="4.47">this is going to happen to try to get</text>
  <text start="929.52" dur="4.35">the deep state to do something and then</text>
  <text start="931.89" dur="4.53">pull back later on we&amp;#39;ve seen them do</text>
  <text start="933.87" dur="4.53">this before so this is something that we</text>
  <text start="936.42" dur="4.77">need to watch but I do believe that</text>
  <text start="938.4" dur="5.76">North Korea at this time most likely</text>
  <text start="941.19" dur="5.28">will not do anything and I can&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="944.16" dur="4.8">the United States is going to go ahead</text>
  <text start="946.47" dur="5.49">and have military drills unless it was</text>
  <text start="948.96" dur="5.19">completely coordinated ahead of time yes</text>
  <text start="951.96" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re saying that North Korea has been</text>
  <text start="954.15" dur="5.39">notified of the schedule as well as the</text>
  <text start="956.94" dur="4.68">defensive nature of the exercises and</text>
  <text start="959.54" dur="3.61">they&amp;#39;re just putting it out there so</text>
  <text start="961.62" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch this very</text>
  <text start="963.15" dur="4.59">carefully to see what happens this is</text>
  <text start="965.4" dur="5.67">very interesting on how this is all</text>
  <text start="967.74" dur="5.58">going to play out now Putin has declared</text>
  <text start="971.07" dur="4.05">that there&amp;#39;s gonna be no arms race he</text>
  <text start="973.32" dur="3.36">says we have everything we need he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="975.12" dur="4.8">saying that we&amp;#39;re gonna be cutting the</text>
  <text start="976.68" dur="5.07">military budget and Trump and Putin are</text>
  <text start="979.92" dur="4.95">going to be speaking together on phone</text>
  <text start="981.75" dur="4.88">on a phone call about this and we can</text>
  <text start="984.87" dur="3.44">see that the deep state they do</text>
  <text start="986.63" dur="3.6">like this whatsoever the neocons don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="988.31" dur="4.41">like this whatsoever but we see it</text>
  <text start="990.23" dur="4.229">happening now we know that the deep</text>
  <text start="992.72" dur="3.929">state had been pushing their agenda in</text>
  <text start="994.459" dur="5.041">Syria they are preparing for chemical</text>
  <text start="996.649" dur="5.221">weapons false flag and it looks like</text>
  <text start="999.5" dur="4.459">they made three attempts of trying to</text>
  <text start="1001.87" dur="6.209">use chemical weapons and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1003.959" dur="8.38">Russia and Syria have blocked it every</text>
  <text start="1008.079" dur="6.69">single time and they couldn&amp;#39;t get the</text>
  <text start="1012.339" dur="5.041">false flag off the ground so they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1014.769" dur="7.05">been blocked every single time we see</text>
  <text start="1017.38" dur="7.199">right now that German AFD lawmakers they</text>
  <text start="1021.819" dur="5.911">visited Syria and they&amp;#39;re saying listen</text>
  <text start="1024.579" dur="5.791">Syria is pretty safe these refugees can</text>
  <text start="1027.73" dur="5.52">now return back to Syria there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1030.37" dur="5.85">reason for them to stay in Germany Syria</text>
  <text start="1033.25" dur="5.339">they&amp;#39;re saying is a safe country Russia</text>
  <text start="1036.22" dur="5.52">says that 65 percent of Syria&amp;#39;s eastern</text>
  <text start="1038.589" dur="6.301">Ghouta is free of rebels so we see right</text>
  <text start="1041.74" dur="7.169">now that what is happening in Syria they</text>
  <text start="1044.89" dur="5.97">the Islamic state al nusra al Qaeda the</text>
  <text start="1048.909" dur="4.561">militants the rest of the paid</text>
  <text start="1050.86" dur="6.059">mercenaries they are being cleared out</text>
  <text start="1053.47" dur="4.38">now the deep state right now has not</text>
  <text start="1056.919" dur="3.451">given up</text>
  <text start="1057.85" dur="6.36">they are building up troops the paid</text>
  <text start="1060.37" dur="7.08">mercenaries to go in and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1064.21" dur="5.209">in to replace the US soldiers that are</text>
  <text start="1067.45" dur="4.709">there now think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="1069.419" dur="5.5">they&amp;#39;re building them the forces up in</text>
  <text start="1072.159" dur="4.531">Jordan these paid mercenaries the Deep</text>
  <text start="1074.919" dur="5.521">States going to bring them in because</text>
  <text start="1076.69" dur="8.369">the US soldiers are leaving the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="1080.44" dur="7.05">area they&amp;#39;re going to replace them why</text>
  <text start="1085.059" dur="4.23">are they replacing them because it looks</text>
  <text start="1087.49" dur="4.11">like they&amp;#39;re getting ready to be pulled</text>
  <text start="1089.289" dur="4.591">out the deep state doesn&amp;#39;t want to give</text>
  <text start="1091.6" dur="4.41">up their positions the deep state wants</text>
  <text start="1093.88" dur="4.47">to continue in Syria the deep state</text>
  <text start="1096.01" dur="5.37">still controls their own Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="1098.35" dur="5.37">which is the paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="1101.38" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;ve always controlled their paid</text>
  <text start="1103.72" dur="4.339">mercenary soldiers this is what they</text>
  <text start="1105.73" dur="4.98">used in each one of these countries to</text>
  <text start="1108.059" dur="5.86">overthrow governments and they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1110.71" dur="6.199">given up yet but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1113.919" dur="5.76">here is that with turkey coming in and</text>
  <text start="1116.909" dur="3.321">pushing and pushing the deep state back</text>
  <text start="1119.679" dur="4.181">in the</text>
  <text start="1120.23" dur="6.81">region it gives the opportunity for</text>
  <text start="1123.86" dur="5.819">Trump and Russia and Syria to say you</text>
  <text start="1127.04" dur="4.98">know something it&amp;#39;s time for the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="1129.679" dur="4.231">leave Trump will agree the US soldiers</text>
  <text start="1132.02" dur="3.93">will leave and guess what they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1133.91" dur="4.889">replaced by paid mercenaries what do you</text>
  <text start="1135.95" dur="5.04">think is gonna happen next the paid</text>
  <text start="1138.799" dur="5.071">mercenaries they&amp;#39;re going to lose out in</text>
  <text start="1140.99" dur="6.45">this area Russia Syria can sweep in and</text>
  <text start="1143.87" dur="6.179">annihilate every paid mercenary in this</text>
  <text start="1147.44" dur="6.54">region the Kurdish region falls back</text>
  <text start="1150.049" dur="5.13">under Assad&amp;#39;s government this has been</text>
  <text start="1153.98" dur="4.02">the plan all along</text>
  <text start="1155.179" dur="6.361">and the deep state then is left with</text>
  <text start="1158" dur="5.25">absolutely nothing and we can see this</text>
  <text start="1161.54" dur="5.19">is what is happening at this point and</text>
  <text start="1163.25" dur="5.7">the push is on and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="1166.73" dur="5.91">doesn&amp;#39;t mean the deep state is out of</text>
  <text start="1168.95" dur="5.91">the game they will try something next</text>
  <text start="1172.64" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to push something</text>
  <text start="1174.86" dur="4.62">much much larger than we can expect</text>
  <text start="1177.71" dur="3.3">maybe it is another mass shooting but I</text>
  <text start="1179.48" dur="3.54">do believe it&amp;#39;s gonna have to be</text>
  <text start="1181.01" dur="4.169">something much larger they tried false</text>
  <text start="1183.02" dur="3.81">flags in Syria they were blocked every</text>
  <text start="1185.179" dur="3.421">single time I think they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1186.83" dur="3.12">ready to push something even larger</text>
  <text start="1188.6" dur="3.72">because if they don&amp;#39;t do anything and</text>
  <text start="1189.95" dur="5.19">they just sit back and nothing is done</text>
  <text start="1192.32" dur="4.489">they are completely finished because</text>
  <text start="1195.14" dur="4.409">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="1196.809" dur="4.691">each leader out in the Middle East is</text>
  <text start="1199.549" dur="3.5">going to take back their country the</text>
  <text start="1201.5" dur="4.58">deep state and their paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="1203.049" dur="5.891">will be left out in the cold and</text>
  <text start="1206.08" dur="5.26">although have left is the corporate</text>
  <text start="1208.94" dur="5.43">media propaganda because they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1211.34" dur="5.91">routed out in government so time is</text>
  <text start="1214.37" dur="5.189">ticking the deep state they&amp;#39;re backed</text>
