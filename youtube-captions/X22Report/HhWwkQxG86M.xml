  <text start="77.45" dur="4.82">guess all the incredible data that came</text>
  <text start="79.49" dur="5.34">out I guess it wasn&amp;#39;t enough to push the</text>

  <text start="104.84" dur="4.29">a lot of great things and then reality</text>
  <text start="106.91" dur="5.099">starts to set in and people say okay I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="109.13" dur="5.19">back in the same position I was before</text>
  <text start="112.009" dur="4.92">the election and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="114.32" dur="6.359">now is the consumer sentiment faded in</text>
  <text start="116.929" dur="6.69">January and miss expectations of 98.1</text>
  <text start="120.679" dur="5.851">verse a 90-point 98.5 which was expected</text>
  <text start="123.619" dur="8.971">and economic expectations that hope they</text>
  <text start="126.53" dur="8.19">also dipped from 89.5 to 88.9 and what</text>
  <text start="132.59" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re seeing is everything starting to</text>
  <text start="134.72" dur="4.26">go the opposite way and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="136.61" dur="4.86">talk about how this market is most</text>
  <text start="138.98" dur="5.16">likely going to melt down during this</text>
  <text start="141.47" dur="4.8">year and bank of america was out there</text>
  <text start="144.14" dur="4.41">reporting that yes the icarus trade is</text>
  <text start="146.27" dur="5.67">going to happen where the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.55" dur="5.4">going to melt down and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="4.29">right now is the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="153.95" dur="6.3">government they&amp;#39;re calling this the</text>
  <text start="156.23" dur="7.2">Trump effect and it seems like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="160.25" dur="5.43">setting all of this up for when the</text>
  <text start="163.43" dur="4.44">system comes down where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="165.68" dur="4.11">look what happened everything was going</text>
  <text start="167.87" dur="4.47">up it&amp;#39;s the Trump effect and everything</text>
  <text start="169.79" dur="3.84">crashes its Trump now remember he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="4.38">really done anything he hasn&amp;#39;t been in</text>
  <text start="173.63" dur="4.59">office yes he spoke to many different</text>
  <text start="176.72" dur="2.79">companies they all talk about how</text>
  <text start="178.22" dur="3.19">they&amp;#39;re going to bring jobs back here</text>
  <text start="179.51" dur="4.98">but the regulations are still</text>
  <text start="181.41" dur="5.13">exactly the way they were the tax</text>
  <text start="184.49" dur="4.06">policies are exactly the way they are</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="4.26">nothing&amp;#39;s changed just yet so a lot of</text>
  <text start="188.55" dur="3.96">this is just talk right now until he</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="3.27">gets into office and he actually changes</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="3.99">things maybe he&amp;#39;s made a lot of promises</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="4.38">to these individual companies saying</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="3.84">this is what I&amp;#39;m going to do and when</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="4.11">you see it start bringing the jobs back</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="4.98">but again he hasn&amp;#39;t done it as of yet</text>
  <text start="202.56" dur="4.44">but what we do see out in the corporate</text>
  <text start="205.32" dur="4.8">media and the US government where</text>
  <text start="207" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re pushing that retail sales were</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="3.66">very good this holiday season now</text>
  <text start="212.1" dur="4.2">remember these are government numbers</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="5.37">and remember a lot of these numbers are</text>
  <text start="216.3" dur="7.05">estimates even when the store closes</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="5.61">down they don&amp;#39;t say oh whoa we just had</text>
  <text start="223.35" dur="3.06">all these stores closed down so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="3.78">no cells from them they spread them out</text>
  <text start="226.41" dur="3.54">over time so it doesn&amp;#39;t hit very hard</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="4.8">and if they don&amp;#39;t like the numbers</text>
  <text start="229.95" dur="5.64">coming in from different companies they</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="3.66">use their own numbers it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="3.87">ridiculous but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="237" dur="5.58">numbers here what&amp;#39;s very interesting as</text>
  <text start="239.46" dur="7.05">we know that gas has moved up in price</text>
  <text start="242.58" dur="5.49">and we realize that these automakers</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="3.33">have been channel stuffing where they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="248.07" dur="4.8">been creating cars bringing them into</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="4.44">the lots and they call that sales so</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="5.01">when you look at this and you include</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="4.8">the increased price of gas and autos and</text>
  <text start="257.88" dur="3.3">remember people aren&amp;#39;t coming up with</text>
  <text start="259.08" dur="3.24">cash going pay give me that 40,000 on</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="3.03">the car here&amp;#39;s forty thousand in cash</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re taking out loans so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="4.35">even using their own money but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="4.47">not how they count sales they count them</text>
  <text start="268.56" dur="3.75">as they enter the dealerships and they</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="3.39">might sit on the lot doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re still counted as sales if you</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="6.33">include those two things retail sales</text>
  <text start="276.84" dur="8.7">have gone up if you subtract autos and</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="7.8">you subtract fuel you see what people</text>
  <text start="285.54" dur="8.54">have really done in the retail market</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="11.7">and when you look at this you see that</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="9.55">retail has dropped and retail did not</text>
  <text start="300.27" dur="6.93">surge like they&amp;#39;re saying actually core</text>
  <text start="303.63" dur="7.59">retail sales growth is weakest in almost</text>
  <text start="307.2" dur="8.01">three years there was no increase in</text>
  <text start="311.22" dur="6.66">spending in December whatsoever</text>
  <text start="315.21" dur="5.16">and remember they use this illusion</text>
  <text start="317.88" dur="3.96">quite often where they say whoa look at</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="6.269">the retail sales they&amp;#39;re incredible I</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="7.199">remember there&amp;#39;s fuel purchases included</text>
  <text start="326.639" dur="4.141">in this and as fuel costs go up they say</text>
  <text start="329.039" dur="5.551">wow retail sales are really blooming</text>
  <text start="330.78" dur="6.06">well you factor that out you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="334.59" dur="4.59">seeing it and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="336.84" dur="5.549">now is electronic and appliance stores</text>
  <text start="339.18" dur="5.31">down negative point five percent we see</text>
  <text start="342.389" dur="4.141">boo food and beverage stores down</text>
  <text start="344.49" dur="4.489">negative point three percent general</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="4.5">merchandise stores down negative 0.5%</text>
  <text start="348.979" dur="4.841">department stores down negative point</text>
  <text start="351.03" dur="7.259">six percent miscellaneous stores down</text>
  <text start="353.82" dur="6.99">one percent we see other areas where</text>
  <text start="358.289" dur="4.831">they&amp;#39;re close to zero they haven&amp;#39;t gone</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="3.359">anywhere so when the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="3.57">out there and they&amp;#39;re telling you that</text>
  <text start="364.169" dur="4.68">everything is fine well not really</text>
  <text start="366.69" dur="5.219">people aren&amp;#39;t really spending in retail</text>
  <text start="368.849" dur="5.07">and again if it&amp;#39;s doing if the economy</text>
  <text start="371.909" dur="5.73">is doing so well and everything&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="373.919" dur="7.021">great why is walmart Macy&amp;#39;s Sears JC</text>
  <text start="377.639" dur="6.03">Penney&amp;#39;s aeropostale a limited lowes and</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="6.949">many other stores laying off and closing</text>
  <text start="383.669" dur="7.05">stores rapidly why is bowling laying off</text>
  <text start="387.889" dur="6.301">individuals wise caterpillar laying off</text>
  <text start="390.719" dur="8.73">individuals what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a</text>
  <text start="394.19" dur="7.39">complete breakdown of the system but</text>
  <text start="399.449" dur="4.141">again those don&amp;#39;t matter what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="401.58" dur="4.98">seeing is everything contract right now</text>
  <text start="403.59" dur="7.079">and with all I remember all these stores</text>
  <text start="406.56" dur="7.77">have an online presence and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.669" dur="8.43">recording right now is the retail sales</text>
  <text start="414.33" dur="6.45">minus autos minus fuel guess what even</text>
  <text start="419.099" dur="5.88">with online sales they haven&amp;#39;t moved</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="7.02">anywhere it&amp;#39;s not as good as they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.979" dur="5.761">saying actually it&amp;#39;s a lot worse now</text>
  <text start="427.8" dur="8.33">department store sales they have formed</text>
  <text start="430.74" dur="8.66">for the 11th straight year in a row I</text>
  <text start="436.13" dur="6.969">mean they&amp;#39;re not doing well at all and</text>
  <text start="439.4" dur="8.32">their online sales they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="443.099" dur="8.311">well either in 2016 they drop 5.6</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="5.22">and this is the second largest decline</text>
  <text start="451.41" dur="6.62">since the government the government</text>
  <text start="452.94" dur="5.09">began keeping records in the early 90s</text>
  <text start="458.48" dur="6.07">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="461.07" dur="6.63">complete breakdown of the entire retail</text>
  <text start="464.55" dur="4.5">industry but there once again out there</text>
  <text start="467.7" dur="5.04">trying to convince you that everything</text>
  <text start="469.05" dur="6">is fine everything&amp;#39;s going well and what</text>
  <text start="472.74" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="475.05" dur="2.7">deteriorating once again we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="476.49" dur="4.5">tracking this for quite a while and</text>
  <text start="477.75" dur="5.43">retail over the years has not improved</text>
  <text start="480.99" dur="3.3">actually when you look back in time and</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="5.1">you look at the reports that we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="484.29" dur="7.41">we see that more stores close each year</text>
  <text start="488.28" dur="5.7">than stores that are expanding actually</text>
  <text start="491.7" dur="4.38">I don&amp;#39;t see many stores expanding I see</text>
  <text start="493.98" dur="4.86">many swords contracting laying off</text>
  <text start="496.08" dur="5.76">individuals and if we go back over time</text>
  <text start="498.84" dur="6.99">I&amp;#39;m talking hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="501.84" dur="6.06">people have been laid off because stores</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="5.01">really don&amp;#39;t exist anymore think about</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="6.15">the stores that used to be around sports</text>
  <text start="510.84" dur="5.21">authority circuit city and many others</text>
  <text start="514.05" dur="4.56">they just don&amp;#39;t exist anymore soon</text>
  <text start="516.05" dur="4.06">you&amp;#39;re not going to see Sears you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="518.61" dur="4.47">going to see JC Penney&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="520.11" dur="5.22">going to see Kmart you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="523.08" dur="6.8">see many stores they&amp;#39;re all going to</text>
  <text start="525.33" dur="8.61">completely disappear we see that as</text>
  <text start="529.88" dur="7.33">mortgage rates move up they are hurting</text>
  <text start="533.94" dur="6.3">the largest mortgage lenders now if the</text>
  <text start="537.21" dur="7.53">economy is so strong and everyone has a</text>
  <text start="540.24" dur="6.75">job moving mortgage rates up a little</text>
  <text start="544.74" dur="5.04">bit shouldn&amp;#39;t that shouldn&amp;#39;t make really</text>
  <text start="546.99" dur="6.98">that big of a difference but just moving</text>
  <text start="549.78" dur="6.87">it up just a tiny fraction a blip well</text>
  <text start="553.97" dur="5.2">the entire real estate industry just</text>
  <text start="556.65" dur="5.82">completely falls apart and when we look</text>
  <text start="559.17" dur="5.04">at wells fargo for instance we see that</text>
  <text start="562.47" dur="5.94">their mortgage lending their mortgage</text>
  <text start="564.21" dur="6.96">applications has been declining over the</text>
  <text start="568.41" dur="6.45">many years when we go back all the way</text>
  <text start="571.17" dur="7.26">to 2011 up to this point we are in a</text>
  <text start="574.86" dur="5.82">downward trend and they&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="578.43" dur="6.73">greater declines</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="6.73">20-17 so who&amp;#39;s buying all these homes</text>
  <text start="585.16" dur="3.72">what we know who&amp;#39;s buying them foreign</text>
  <text start="587.41" dur="3.799">investors hedge fund&amp;#39;s investment</text>
  <text start="588.88" dur="5.28">companies it&amp;#39;s not the everyday American</text>
  <text start="591.209" dur="6.75">actually most of the Americans who are</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="6.539">out there they&amp;#39;re just getting by</text>
  <text start="597.959" dur="4.75">they&amp;#39;re just trying to make it those</text>
  <text start="600.699" dur="4.771">people who are graduating college they</text>
  <text start="602.709" dur="6.481">can&amp;#39;t find the high paying job very</text>
  <text start="605.47" dur="6.21">difficult now down in Mexico we see</text>
  <text start="609.19" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of problems there</text>
  <text start="611.68" dur="6.599">we see people are protesting people are</text>
  <text start="614.86" dur="7.38">angry we&amp;#39;re seeing surging gas prices</text>
  <text start="618.279" dur="7.62">and what has happened since December</text>
  <text start="622.24" dur="6.18">27th is that the government used to</text>
  <text start="625.899" dur="4.05">subsidize the gas prices and the</text>
  <text start="628.42" dur="5.58">government decided that we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="629.949" dur="7.231">to do this any longer and come January</text>
  <text start="634" dur="6.779">first what happened was gas prices</text>
  <text start="637.18" dur="11.01">started to move up and what we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="640.779" dur="10.441">is gas has gone up twenty percent now</text>
  <text start="648.19" dur="6.24">this is a huge rise for the people and</text>
  <text start="651.22" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to get fuel at this</text>
  <text start="654.43" dur="5.04">point because it&amp;#39;s very expensive and</text>
  <text start="657.04" dur="5.669">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="659.47" dur="6.059">price increases they&amp;#39;re coming as part</text>
  <text start="662.709" dur="5.461">of a planned liberalisation of Mexico&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="665.529" dur="5.011">energy market which involves the move</text>
  <text start="668.17" dur="5.46">from subsidies the cat gas prices very</text>
  <text start="670.54" dur="4.859">low to a market-based pricing scheme</text>
  <text start="673.63" dur="4.53">that will adjust prices at the pump</text>
  <text start="675.399" dur="6.511">based on supply and demand now the price</text>
  <text start="678.16" dur="6.239">ceilings will then be adjusted starting</text>
  <text start="681.91" dur="4.799">februari 18th before letting supply</text>
  <text start="684.399" dur="4.591">demand determining them in March and</text>
  <text start="686.709" dur="4.771">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="688.99" dur="5.52">people they don&amp;#39;t know what to do at</text>
  <text start="691.48" dur="6.57">this point because it is very expensive</text>
  <text start="694.51" dur="5.639">in getting the fuel and people are angry</text>
  <text start="698.05" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re running to the gas stations</text>
  <text start="700.149" dur="5.851">filling it up and the cartels they are</text>
