  <text start="86.97" dur="3.569">the central bankers are trying to</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="3.81">explain this away of why it was so bad</text>
  <text start="90.539" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re blaming it on verizon because of</text>
  <text start="92.16" dur="4.92">the strike they&amp;#39;re having of what 30 60</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="5.521">or so thousand people who are striking</text>

  <text start="137.069" dur="5.431">soared to the highest level that we seen</text>
  <text start="139.739" dur="4.5">since the last recession and the White</text>

  <text start="146.459" dur="5.821">big of a deal it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>

  <text start="152.28" dur="6.959">okay just believe us well it&amp;#39;s not okay</text>
  <text start="156.81" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating all of these</text>
  <text start="159.239" dur="8.161">numbers and JP Morgan right now</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="7.23">because of what&amp;#39;s been going on there</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="8.07">recession indicator hit a high of 36</text>
  <text start="171.12" dur="5.52">percent and very interesting everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="2.52">always wondering like when&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="176.64" dur="3.39">collapse going to come when&amp;#39;s the next</text>
  <text start="177.99" dur="5.6">recession going to come well Deutsche</text>
  <text start="180.03" dur="6.12">Bank I don&amp;#39;t know if they slipped up or</text>
  <text start="183.59" dur="4.96">they were trying to explain something</text>
  <text start="186.15" dur="6.39">but they came out and they started</text>
  <text start="188.55" dur="8.58">discussing when the next recession /</text>
  <text start="192.54" dur="8.82">depression / collapse will hit and their</text>
  <text start="197.13" dur="7.65">answer was profit margins always peak in</text>
  <text start="201.36" dur="6.84">advance of recession there has not been</text>
  <text start="204.78" dur="7.47">one business cycle since post-world War</text>
  <text start="208.2" dur="6.99">two where this has not been the case the</text>
  <text start="212.25" dur="4.68">reason margins are leading indicators is</text>
  <text start="215.19" dur="5.07">simple when corporate profitability</text>
  <text start="216.93" dur="5.85">declines a pullback in spending and</text>
  <text start="220.26" dur="4.05">hiring eventually ensues normally</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="4.83">margins compressed because of cost</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="6.84">pressures and namely the label the labor</text>
  <text start="227.61" dur="5.73">share of income Rises relative to the</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="4.05">corporate share of income but another</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="5.16">way when companies compete for scarce</text>
  <text start="235.2" dur="5.31">labor resources worker pay is bid up in</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="4.62">turn inflation pressures that often</text>
  <text start="240.51" dur="5.25">surface this typically induces a</text>
  <text start="243.12" dur="4.11">monetary policy response the Fed begins</text>
  <text start="245.76" dur="6.24">raising interest rates to dampen</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="8.729">inflation as a reminder profit margins</text>
  <text start="252" dur="6.299">peaked in the third quarter of 2014 with</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="5.191">that in mind and we look back at the</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="5.041">historical data it reveals that the</text>
  <text start="261.15" dur="4.74">average and median lead times between</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="5.49">the peak and margins and the onset of a</text>
  <text start="265.89" dur="5.52">recession are nine and eight quarters</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="5.55">now if we take what Deutsche Bank has</text>
  <text start="271.41" dur="7.73">been saying and we look at the economy</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="7.65">and we calculate this out the economy</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="5.35">according to deutsche bank would enter</text>
  <text start="282.03" dur="5.84">the recession the second half of this</text>
  <text start="284.49" dur="9.179">year because when we look back in time</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="7.81">what do we see well we see back in two</text>
  <text start="293.669" dur="4.141">thousand eight actually prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="4.98">the business cycle between two</text>
  <text start="297.81" dur="5.12">two and two thousand seven we hit peak</text>
  <text start="300.66" dur="7.89">margins the third quarter of two</text>
  <text start="302.93" dur="11.53">thousand six distance two recessions in</text>
  <text start="308.55" dur="10.02">quarters was six two thousand nine to</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="9.48">present we hit peak margins in the third</text>
  <text start="318.57" dur="8.48">quarter of 2014 and we&amp;#39;re right about</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="5.52">there if we go back a little bit further</text>
  <text start="327.05" dur="5.17">say to nineteen eighty three to nineteen</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="5.7">ninety business cycle we hit peak</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="6.48">margins in 1988 the fourth quarter of</text>
  <text start="335.16" dur="6.69">1988 the distance to the next recession</text>
  <text start="338.7" dur="4.529">was eight quarters if we go back even</text>
  <text start="341.85" dur="3.42">further in nineteen seventy five to</text>
  <text start="343.229" dur="4.621">nineteen eighty we look at the peak</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="7.5">margins it was nineteen seventy eight in</text>
  <text start="347.85" dur="8.94">the fourth quarter six quarters until</text>
  <text start="352.77" dur="6.81">the recession and deutsche bank when</text>
  <text start="356.79" dur="4.65">they came out with this they tried to do</text>
  <text start="359.58" dur="3.66">a little tap dance try to explain away</text>
  <text start="361.44" dur="4.91">why oh no this is not what we really</text>
  <text start="363.24" dur="5.76">meant but it looks like at this point</text>
  <text start="366.35" dur="6.34">they are trying to tell us that</text>
  <text start="369" dur="5.25">something is about to hit the second</text>
  <text start="372.69" dur="3.63">half of this year and this is from</text>
  <text start="374.25" dur="4.4">deutsche bank this is not a prediction</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="4.909">this is just looking at past records</text>
  <text start="378.65" dur="5.8">looking at what they&amp;#39;ve said and</text>
  <text start="381.229" dur="5.771">projecting it out and it seems like we</text>
  <text start="384.45" dur="6.63">hit that same time period every single</text>
  <text start="387" dur="6.15">time this occurs since world war two now</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="4.62">very interestingly Judicial Watch came</text>
  <text start="393.15" dur="4.53">out with a report that the Department of</text>
  <text start="395.7" dur="4.5">Homeland Security is quietly</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="5.489">transporting illegal immigrants from the</text>
  <text start="400.2" dur="5.01">Mexican border to Phoenix and releasing</text>
  <text start="403.169" dur="4.56">them without proper processing or</text>
  <text start="405.21" dur="4.17">issuing court appearance documents now</text>
  <text start="407.729" dur="5.31">this is coming from a Border Patrol</text>
  <text start="409.38" dur="7.039">which has told Judicial Watch about all</text>
  <text start="413.039" dur="5.221">of this and this border patrol agent and</text>
  <text start="416.419" dur="4.271">supervisors that are on the front line</text>
  <text start="418.26" dur="4.35">they say illegal immigrants are being</text>
  <text start="420.69" dur="4.56">released in droves because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="5.88">room to keep them in detention areas</text>
  <text start="425.25" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re telling the Border Patrol people</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="6.84">to put them on a bus and just let</text>
  <text start="431.61" dur="5.79">them go and what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="435.33" dur="4.16">they&amp;#39;re going to take these individuals</text>
  <text start="437.4" dur="6.359">and just send them across the country</text>
  <text start="439.49" dur="7.359">now DHS completely denies all of this</text>
  <text start="443.759" dur="6">but during a congressional testimony of</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="5.82">bandon Jud chief of the National border</text>
  <text start="449.759" dur="4.921">patrol council the labor union that</text>
  <text start="452.669" dur="4.62">represents line agents judge told</text>
  <text start="454.68" dur="4.41">lawmakers on the house of the Judiciary</text>
  <text start="457.289" dur="3.87">Committee that illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="4.109">without serious criminal convictions can</text>
  <text start="461.159" dur="5.341">be released immediately and disappear</text>
  <text start="463.199" dur="7.861">into the shadows so we can see at this</text>
  <text start="466.5" dur="6.389">point DHS is doing this and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="471.06" dur="3.3">taking whatever illegals and just</text>
  <text start="472.889" dur="3.361">sending them wherever they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="474.36" dur="6.179">working papers they&amp;#39;re getting benefits</text>
  <text start="476.25" dur="6.659">and listen I have nothing against people</text>
  <text start="480.539" dur="4.38">coming into this country if they go</text>
  <text start="482.909" dur="4.141">through the proper channels if a person</text>
  <text start="484.919" dur="3.691">sneaks into a movie theater should they</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="4.41">just get the seat without paying for the</text>
  <text start="488.61" dur="6.239">ticket if a person sneaks into a</text>
  <text start="491.46" dur="5.699">sporting event and the authorities know</text>
  <text start="494.849" dur="4.231">about it should they just say okay you</text>
  <text start="497.159" dur="6.06">know what you made it in no big deal</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="6.209">take a seat there&amp;#39;s a reason why we have</text>
  <text start="503.219" dur="6.45">borders there&amp;#39;s a reason why we have</text>
  <text start="505.289" dur="7.891">checks and balances because the borders</text>
  <text start="509.669" dur="8.37">are the doorway to the United States</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="7.529">which is our house and they have to come</text>
  <text start="518.039" dur="4.531">through the doorway you have to be</text>
  <text start="520.709" dur="3.781">checked out and then you can be let into</text>
  <text start="522.57" dur="3.629">the country this is why the border</text>
  <text start="524.49" dur="3.529">should be locked down just like you lock</text>
  <text start="526.199" dur="5.341">your house now you trust your neighbors</text>
  <text start="528.019" dur="6.82">you trust your friends your family but</text>
  <text start="531.54" dur="5.07">you still lock your house why because</text>
  <text start="534.839" dur="4.321">you&amp;#39;re nervous and afraid that someone</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="5.729">might try to get in same thing with the</text>
  <text start="539.16" dur="6.299">United States people that are coming</text>
  <text start="542.339" dur="4.381">here we don&amp;#39;t know their background we</text>
  <text start="545.459" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re escaping their</text>
  <text start="546.72" dur="5.429">country because of war crimes or some</text>
  <text start="549.779" dur="3.601">other type of criminal activity and this</text>
  <text start="552.149" dur="3.571">is why they need to go through the</text>
  <text start="553.38" dur="4.709">checks and balances not just to jump</text>
  <text start="555.72" dur="4.17">over and say okay you are now in the</text>
  <text start="558.089" dur="3.421">country you&amp;#39;re allowed to stay here</text>
  <text start="559.89" dur="2.88">we&amp;#39;re going to New no background checks</text>
  <text start="561.51" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re just going to put you on a bus and</text>
  <text start="562.77" dur="3.569">send you off because if that</text>
  <text start="565.17" dur="3.599">the case there&amp;#39;s no reason to have</text>
  <text start="566.339" dur="5.341">borders whatsoever and this is pretty</text>
  <text start="568.769" dur="5.13">much what the elite really want they</text>
  <text start="571.68" dur="4.649">don&amp;#39;t want borders what their whole</text>
  <text start="573.899" dur="4.531">entire goal is from the beginning is to</text>
  <text start="576.329" dur="3.57">make a one-world government and with a</text>
  <text start="578.43" dur="4.5">one-world government you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="579.899" dur="4.921">borders you don&amp;#39;t need different ethnic</text>
  <text start="582.93" dur="4.23">backgrounds you don&amp;#39;t need different</text>
  <text start="584.82" dur="6.42">countries they want to blend everything</text>
  <text start="587.16" dur="5.85">all together and say that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.24" dur="5.69">what their whole purpose and this is</text>
  <text start="593.01" dur="6.81">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do now the FBI</text>
  <text start="596.93" dur="6.459">they&amp;#39;re out there and they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="723.69" dur="5.61">has been happening because in 2015 the</text>

  <text start="740.82" dur="3.78">the past I&amp;#39;m going to say it again we</text>
  <text start="742.65" dur="5.16">all need to protect our own information</text>
  <text start="744.6" dur="5.52">we need to use encrypted email we need</text>

  <text start="750.12" dur="3.78">possibly can and I know it&amp;#39;s not perfect</text>

  <text start="761.55" dur="5.34">for criminals individuals to get into it</text>
  <text start="764.49" dur="5.7">and this is what we&amp;#39;re doing here we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="770.19" dur="5.28">individuals and these agencies to get</text>
  <text start="772.65" dur="6.12">your information there&amp;#39;s no reason why</text>
  <text start="775.47" dur="5.25">they should have free access with ease</text>
  <text start="778.77" dur="4.17">getting all the information and this is</text>
  <text start="780.72" dur="4.26">why we all need use encryption we need</text>
  <text start="782.94" dur="4.8">to use products like block a pocket calm</text>
  <text start="784.98" dur="4.68">which is a sleeve which is intertwined</text>

  <text start="792.51" dur="3.15">they can&amp;#39;t track you you can slip your</text>
  <text start="793.83" dur="4.199">credit card information in there so it</text>
  <text start="795.66" dur="3.69">blocks the signal so people can&amp;#39;t walk</text>
  <text start="798.029" dur="4.471">by with scanners and get the information</text>
  <text start="799.35" dur="5.37">off the chip we all need to do this we</text>

  <text start="878.01" dur="7.86">do there is no proof at all nothing they</text>
  <text start="883.44" dur="5.339">just went with it and they increased</text>

  <text start="888.779" dur="5.881">they placed financial sanctions on North</text>
  <text start="892.8" dur="4.56">Korea and they&amp;#39;re just continually doing</text>
  <text start="894.66" dur="6.57">this because they need to provoke these</text>
