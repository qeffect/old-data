  <text start="92.06" dur="6.66">complete destruction of the economy the</text>
  <text start="95.42" dur="5.1">central banks they are panicking each</text>
  <text start="98.72" dur="2.93">central bank is doing something</text>
  <text start="100.52" dur="4.65">completely different than the other</text>
  <text start="101.65" dur="5.98">where before they were all kind of</text>
  <text start="105.17" dur="4.92">working together but now it seems like</text>
  <text start="107.63" dur="4.32">they are not we&amp;#39;ll get into that in just</text>
  <text start="110.09" dur="3.06">a minute but when we look at the economy</text>
  <text start="111.95" dur="4.19">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for a very</text>
  <text start="113.15" dur="5.52">long time and it all starts with housing</text>
  <text start="116.14" dur="5.769">because housing is where the</text>
  <text start="118.67" dur="5.879">middle-class keeps a lot of their wealth</text>
  <text start="121.909" dur="5.371">they invest in their home they keep</text>
  <text start="124.549" dur="5.371">their home for a very long time at the</text>
  <text start="127.28" dur="5.73">end they hope that it appreciates they</text>
  <text start="129.92" dur="5.94">sell it and this is a lot this is a</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="6.66">large portion of their wealth when the</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="8.31">housing market falls apart and prices</text>
  <text start="139.67" dur="5.3">come down the middle class loses their</text>
  <text start="144.17" dur="3.72">wealth</text>
  <text start="144.97" dur="5.019">yes wealthy people do the lower middle</text>
  <text start="147.89" dur="3.81">class does but the majority of the</text>
  <text start="149.989" dur="4.921">country they lose a lot of their wealth</text>
  <text start="151.7" dur="5.789">why do you think the central banks when</text>
  <text start="154.91" dur="4.439">they started to pump up these bubbles</text>
  <text start="157.489" dur="4.021">why do you think they did it in the</text>
  <text start="159.349" dur="4.681">housing market because they knew that</text>
  <text start="161.51" dur="3.51">people would feel comfortable and they</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="3.51">would hopefully</text>
  <text start="165.02" dur="5.16">and spend money or take out equity lines</text>
  <text start="167.54" dur="5.7">of credit and use this in the retail</text>
  <text start="170.18" dur="6.45">market they were hoping they would have</text>
  <text start="173.24" dur="6.72">a repeat leading up to 2008-2009 before</text>
  <text start="176.63" dur="4.85">everything fell apart but guess what the</text>
  <text start="179.96" dur="7.8">American people they were tapped out</text>
  <text start="181.48" dur="7.6">they had nothing to give anymore and a</text>
  <text start="187.76" dur="3.29">lot of people couldn&amp;#39;t afford the homes</text>
  <text start="189.08" dur="5.34">a lot of people lost their homes and</text>
  <text start="191.05" dur="5.14">they tried psychologically to make</text>
  <text start="194.42" dur="3.87">people feel like oh look I&amp;#39;m wealthy</text>
  <text start="196.19" dur="5.01">because prices are going up people</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="5.64">didn&amp;#39;t buy it this time and this is why</text>
  <text start="201.2" dur="4.47">we see refinancing declining this is why</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="3.09">we see mortgage applications declining</text>
  <text start="205.67" dur="4.23">and remember when we were going through</text>
  <text start="207.02" dur="5.19">these stages a lot of these purchases</text>
  <text start="209.9" dur="3.75">were with cash you really think the</text>
  <text start="212.21" dur="2.97">middle class is coming up with three</text>
  <text start="213.65" dur="5.34">four five six hundred thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="215.18" dur="6.27">in cash to purchase a home no these were</text>
  <text start="218.99" dur="4.08">speculators these were foreign investors</text>
  <text start="221.45" dur="3.69">these were hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="223.07" dur="3.39">companies they were the ones purchasing</text>
  <text start="225.14" dur="3.66">the homes keeping them off the market to</text>
  <text start="226.46" dur="3.96">drive the prices up and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.8" dur="4.5">seeing right now is prices have gotten</text>
  <text start="230.42" dur="4.38">so high that in some areas like San</text>
  <text start="233.3" dur="3.9">Francisco especially in California many</text>
  <text start="234.8" dur="4.35">different areas in California the</text>
  <text start="237.2" dur="5.31">average price of a home is one million</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="5.73">dollars now if I go back a year two</text>
  <text start="242.51" dur="3.78">years ago where we started a report in</text>
  <text start="244.88" dur="3.39">different cities prices we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="4.08">to come down and again everything</text>
  <text start="248.27" dur="3.78">doesn&amp;#39;t happen all at once and I think</text>
  <text start="250.37" dur="5.28">people can&amp;#39;t wrap their brains around</text>
  <text start="252.05" dur="5.82">why this happens everything that happens</text>
  <text start="255.65" dur="4.49">in the market with real estate and other</text>
  <text start="257.87" dur="4.59">things it doesn&amp;#39;t happen all together</text>
  <text start="260.14" dur="5.26">simultaneously it&amp;#39;s like a hurricane</text>
  <text start="262.46" dur="5.13">that hits it hits Florida moves up then</text>
  <text start="265.4" dur="4.23">to Georgia then moves up to South</text>
  <text start="267.59" dur="4.02">Carolina so everyone gets hit at a</text>
  <text start="269.63" dur="3.96">different point in time same thing with</text>
  <text start="271.61" dur="4.08">housing as it declines you&amp;#39;ll see it in</text>
  <text start="273.59" dur="3.84">the outskirts and you&amp;#39;ll see the prices</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="4.59">come down and you&amp;#39;ll see the real estate</text>
  <text start="277.43" dur="4.83">market stall and then it hits another</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="4.11">area then another area then bigger</text>
  <text start="282.26" dur="3.99">cities especially with their speculators</text>
  <text start="284.39" dur="3.27">some of the other areas where the</text>
  <text start="286.25" dur="3.69">central bank is pumped up the bubbles</text>
  <text start="287.66" dur="5.13">though sometimes are the last areas</text>
  <text start="289.94" dur="5.64">where they are hit so a lot of people</text>
  <text start="292.79" dur="5.76">don&amp;#39;t see it coming but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="295.58" dur="4.77">seeing now is that the entire</text>
  <text start="298.55" dur="4.05">economic system and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="300.35" dur="3.66">the housing system right now</text>
  <text start="302.6" dur="4.62">which is going to lead into other things</text>
  <text start="304.01" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="5.58">seen new homes existing homes</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="4.56">DR Horton all reporting that we have</text>
  <text start="312.8" dur="4.23">problems headed our way</text>
  <text start="314.18" dur="4.29">this is we beat this was before the Fed</text>
  <text start="317.03" dur="3.6">started to raise the rates but as the</text>
  <text start="318.47" dur="4.65">Fed is raising rates it just accelerates</text>
  <text start="320.63" dur="4.8">the process now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>

  <text start="452.48" dur="7.8">back to 2006 going into 2000 and 2008</text>
  <text start="456.56" dur="7.2">you see the same exact pattern remember</text>
  <text start="460.28" dur="5.04">when the people in California just</text>
  <text start="463.76" dur="5.4">walked out of their house when rates</text>
  <text start="465.32" dur="5.19">went up and then all of a sudden traffic</text>
  <text start="469.16" dur="2.76">started to dry up across the country</text>
  <text start="470.51" dur="3.03">especially those people that remember</text>
  <text start="471.92" dur="3.69">selling their houses at the time</text>
  <text start="473.54" dur="4.5">you remember that traffic just all of a</text>
  <text start="475.61" dur="3.99">sudden came to a standstill now it did</text>
  <text start="478.04" dur="4.23">it happen in every single place at the</text>
  <text start="479.6" dur="5.43">same exact time of course not but what</text>
  <text start="482.27" dur="5.15">happened was for example it started in</text>
  <text start="485.03" dur="5.34">New York six to eight months later</text>
  <text start="487.42" dur="5.53">Florida was hit like no-one has ever</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="4.47">seen everything came to a screeching</text>
  <text start="492.95" dur="3.33">halt he saw cranes all over the place</text>
  <text start="494.84" dur="4.23">and guess what</text>
  <text start="496.28" dur="5.61">they just stopped building buildings</text>
  <text start="499.07" dur="4.32">were completely empty and yes the</text>
  <text start="501.89" dur="4.11">central bank they were able to pump up</text>
  <text start="503.39" dur="6.3">the bubbles but they&amp;#39;re all popping now</text>
  <text start="506" dur="5.31">this is part of the plan this is part of</text>
  <text start="509.69" dur="4.229">the plan right now because think about</text>
  <text start="511.31" dur="4.8">what&amp;#39;s happening here the Fed is raising</text>
  <text start="513.919" dur="5.161">rates what are the other central banks</text>
  <text start="516.11" dur="5.309">doing the ECB for instance well the</text>
  <text start="519.08" dur="4.589">eurozone they could not borrow from the</text>
  <text start="521.419" dur="5.251">momentum of the US economy in the third</text>
  <text start="523.669" dur="5.011">quarter their economic growth has</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="5.27">slumped to a temp at point two percent</text>
  <text start="528.68" dur="6.33">the slowest rate in more than four years</text>
  <text start="531.94" dur="5.47">so with the nineteen nation currency</text>
  <text start="535.01" dur="4.35">block beginning to stagnate what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="5.69">happening are they gonna raise interest</text>
  <text start="539.36" dur="6.03">rates no they&amp;#39;re at zero or negative</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="4.63">what do you think the ECB is gonna end</text>
  <text start="545.39" dur="4.56">up doing they&amp;#39;re gonna pump up the</text>
  <text start="547.73" dur="5.19">stimulus right now but what is the Fed</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="5.19">doing they&amp;#39;re tightening I know the ECB</text>
  <text start="552.92" dur="4.29">talked about tightening they can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="555.14" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re gonna be doing the opposite of</text>
  <text start="557.21" dur="5.01">what the Fed is doing remember I do</text>
  <text start="560.39" dur="4.71">believe that Powell was put into</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="3.69">position to work with Trump to raise</text>
  <text start="565.1" dur="3.63">interest rates</text>
  <text start="565.91" dur="5.34">and Powell was never an easy money Fed</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="5.13">he was going to raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="4.97">yelling easy money Fed Bernanke easy</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="5.4">money fent greets man easy money Fed</text>
  <text start="576.22" dur="5.89">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the plan</text>
  <text start="579.26" dur="4.52">moving forward why is the plan moving</text>
  <text start="582.11" dur="4.2">forward and why is Trump out there</text>
  <text start="583.78" dur="4.72">blaming the deep state for the collapse</text>
  <text start="586.31" dur="4.74">of the stock market why is he out there</text>
  <text start="588.5" dur="4.02">blaming the Fed for the collapse of the</text>
  <text start="591.05" dur="4.89">economy if they keep raising interest</text>
  <text start="592.52" dur="7.5">rates what is happening all at the same</text>
  <text start="595.94" dur="7.41">time well remember the plan</text>
  <text start="600.02" dur="5.85">is just not one thing the plan is to go</text>
  <text start="603.35" dur="5.43">after the central bank to go after those</text>
  <text start="605.87" dur="5.85">who are corrupted to bring these people</text>
  <text start="608.78" dur="5.07">to justice and all of this has to happen</text>
  <text start="611.72" dur="5.22">at the same time because they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="613.85" dur="4.47">lumped into the same group you have to</text>
  <text start="616.94" dur="4.41">show that these groups are</text>
  <text start="618.32" dur="5.1">interconnected and that is what we are</text>
  <text start="621.35" dur="5.64">seeing right now the central banks they</text>
  <text start="623.42" dur="5.46">are in a panic right now because they</text>
  <text start="626.99" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t want the system to come down</text>
  <text start="628.88" dur="4.38">remember if one central bank is blamed</text>
  <text start="631.43" dur="5.49">what do you think happens to the other</text>
  <text start="633.26" dur="5.49">ones they&amp;#39;re blamed too and it leads all</text>
  <text start="636.92" dur="5.13">the way back up to the IMF the biz the</text>
  <text start="638.75" dur="7.11">Ross trials that is the main goal and</text>
  <text start="642.05" dur="4.64">when countries get on board and say we</text>
  <text start="645.86" dur="3.72">wait a minute</text>
  <text start="646.69" dur="5.17">the central bank they raised interest</text>
  <text start="649.58" dur="4.98">rates in the u.s. brought down the</text>
