  <text start="204.859" dur="5.401">collapse it&amp;#39;s been collapsing all this</text>
  <text start="208.76" dur="3.979">time we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="6.33">looking at all the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="212.739" dur="7.06">now as we know they are continually</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="6.39">creating inventory no one&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="219.799" dur="6.39">buying it and the inventory is stocking</text>
  <text start="222.98" dur="5.399">you know stacking up and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="226.189" dur="5.431">seeing right now is that December</text>
  <text start="228.379" dur="6.45">inventory sells ratio is drastically</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="7.609">higher than at a year end of 2014 and is</text>
  <text start="234.829" dur="10.74">back at levels that have always</text>
  <text start="239.229" dur="8.171">coincided with recessions and the</text>
  <text start="245.569" dur="6.54">current spread between sales and</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="10.889">inventories is now at a record absolute</text>
  <text start="252.109" dur="9.331">high so sales are tumbling inventory is</text>
  <text start="258.289" dur="7.711">continually rising we&amp;#39;re headed to a</text>
  <text start="261.44" dur="10.38">collapse scenario that&amp;#39;s it the Baltic</text>
  <text start="266" dur="11.12">Dry Index has now fallen to 291 points</text>
  <text start="271.82" dur="8.279">down two more points this is horrific</text>
  <text start="277.12" dur="7.299">we&amp;#39;ve never seen and it just keeps going</text>
  <text start="280.099" dur="5.671">down now a lot of people are out there</text>
  <text start="284.419" dur="2.821">saying well it&amp;#39;s all going to turn</text>
  <text start="285.77" dur="2.82">around this is just a little bump in the</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="2.82">road you know how long they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="288.59" dur="4.23">saying this is just a little bump in the</text>
  <text start="290.06" dur="4.65">road you know how long they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="292.82" dur="5.129">saying that this is what a recovery</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="3.84">looks like it seems at this point that</text>
  <text start="297.949" dur="3.901">this is just</text>
  <text start="298.55" dur="5.79">brainwashing now no no keep believing us</text>
  <text start="301.85" dur="5.55">this is normal when the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="304.34" dur="5.34">and all the stores closed and everyone</text>
  <text start="307.4" dur="5.58">gets laid off this is what recoveries</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="6.39">look like yes no this is not what a</text>
  <text start="312.98" dur="6.63">recovery looks like a recovery would be</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="6.96">an expansion of retail hirings all over</text>
  <text start="319.61" dur="6">the place corporations expanding buying</text>
  <text start="323.03" dur="3.81">new buildings to hire more people the</text>
  <text start="325.61" dur="3.48">bolt that dry index would be</text>
  <text start="326.84" dur="4.89">skyrocketing because you need the raw</text>
  <text start="329.09" dur="3.75">material to build the products to sell</text>
  <text start="331.73" dur="5.19">to the people because they would be</text>
  <text start="332.84" dur="7.16">demand we&amp;#39;re not seeing this demand is</text>
  <text start="336.92" dur="7.11">not there this is why we see inventories</text>
  <text start="340" dur="6.88">skyrocketing at this point Obama has</text>
  <text start="344.03" dur="8.25">sent his spending plan to Congress four</text>
  <text start="346.88" dur="7.5">point one trillion dollars and this is</text>

  <text start="354.38" dur="5.88">terror threats global warming which is</text>
  <text start="357.11" dur="5.6">non-existent but with what he did very</text>
  <text start="360.26" dur="7.11">interestingly in this new proposal is</text>
  <text start="362.71" dur="7.45">that he increased taxes by two point six</text>
  <text start="367.37" dur="5.76">trillion in 10 years now the first</text>
  <text start="370.16" dur="6.54">go-around it was at one point four</text>
  <text start="373.13" dur="7.17">trillion he basically doubled it why</text>
  <text start="376.7" dur="6.36">because they realize with this new</text>
  <text start="380.3" dur="5.61">budget with the debt continually rising</text>
  <text start="383.06" dur="6.12">it cannot be sustained we need more</text>
  <text start="385.91" dur="5.79">revenue coming into the government yes</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="5.81">the plan also included the ten dollar a</text>
  <text start="391.7" dur="7.56">barrel fee on oil which is 25 cents</text>
  <text start="394.99" dur="5.98">tacked on to the oil prices so when you</text>
  <text start="399.26" dur="4.62">go to the gas station just to be a</text>

  <text start="403.88" dur="4.41">something that the people have to give</text>
  <text start="405.88" dur="4.65">well the people don&amp;#39;t have any more to</text>
  <text start="408.29" dur="4.71">give the people are losing their jobs</text>
