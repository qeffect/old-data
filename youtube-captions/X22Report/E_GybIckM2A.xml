  <text start="559.26" dur="3.69">Russia join the campaign of sanctions</text>
  <text start="560.97" dur="3.989">against North Korea with the aim of</text>
  <text start="562.95" dur="4.079">breeding discord between the countries</text>
  <text start="564.959" dur="3.931">and the North Korean Foreign Minister</text>

  <text start="568.89" dur="3.6">holding back North Korea back from</text>
  <text start="570.3" dur="4.11">engaging in dialogue with the US and</text>
  <text start="572.49" dur="4.38">from engaging in Russia&amp;#39;s economic</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="5.22">proposals is the fact that North Korea</text>
  <text start="576.87" dur="4.65">of refuses to negotiate with any party</text>
  <text start="579.63" dur="4.86">until the u.s. ceases its military</text>
  <text start="581.52" dur="6">threats against North Korea and the</text>

  <text start="594.12" dur="7.1">the drills they won&amp;#39;t even do that</text>
  <text start="596.43" dur="9.32">why because they&amp;#39;re trying to push war</text>

  <text start="622.2" dur="5.16">doesn&amp;#39;t mean the cabal is not going to</text>
  <text start="624.93" dur="4.5">try something because we can see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="627.36" dur="5.15">already their backs are against the wall</text>
  <text start="629.43" dur="7.29">there&amp;#39;s infighting within government and</text>
  <text start="632.51" dur="7.24">right now they&amp;#39;re losing the middle east</text>
  <text start="636.72" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re losing their edge we see already</text>
  <text start="639.75" dur="6.51">that the Iraqi Kurd army agrees to</text>
  <text start="642.87" dur="5.34">return the 2003 borders that they</text>

  <text start="675.39" dur="3.27">allow the Islamic state out of Iraq</text>
  <text start="677.25" dur="4.26">because they saw what was happening</text>
  <text start="678.66" dur="4.86">where Russia and Syria were clearing</text>
  <text start="681.51" dur="4.14">everything out and they needed to get</text>
  <text start="683.52" dur="4.56">the Islamic state out and now we see</text>

  <text start="750.72" dur="7.38">going to ask them to leave once this</text>
  <text start="754.14" dur="6.48">happens game over because the pipeline</text>
  <text start="758.1" dur="5.97">that they wanted going through Syria up</text>
  <text start="760.62" dur="5.22">until you up into Europe and also going</text>
  <text start="764.07" dur="3.6">into Iran and having regime change in</text>
  <text start="765.84" dur="3.81">all these countries and basically</text>

  <text start="780.96" dur="7.92">starting to worry and as we can see once</text>
  <text start="784.8" dur="6.15">that announcement comes they might pull</text>
  <text start="788.88" dur="4.08">off the next event they&amp;#39;ve been building</text>
  <text start="790.95" dur="4.2">the propaganda they&amp;#39;ve been telling us</text>
  <text start="792.96" dur="3.93">about cyberattacks about bringing in the</text>
  <text start="795.15" dur="4.95">stock market down they&amp;#39;ve been telling</text>
  <text start="796.89" dur="5.54">us about them sending phishing emails to</text>
  <text start="800.1" dur="6.03">bring down the power grid they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="802.43" dur="6.9">building up the provocations in North</text>
  <text start="806.13" dur="5.43">Korea and it looks like they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="809.33" dur="6.13">stopping because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="811.56" dur="5.34">they have no options left except for</text>
  <text start="815.46" dur="3.83">some type of an event now what is this</text>
  <text start="816.9" dur="5.22">event going to be we don&amp;#39;t exactly know</text>
  <text start="819.29" dur="5.83">but we know they&amp;#39;re becoming very very</text>
  <text start="822.12" dur="6.75">desperate and we can see already that</text>
  <text start="825.12" dur="7.86">the global economic system is imploding</text>
  <text start="828.87" dur="5.49">at a very very rapid pace and the real</text>
  <text start="832.98" dur="2.61">economy is not just here in the United</text>
  <text start="834.36" dur="3.39">States and the bubbles around the world</text>
  <text start="835.59" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re all starting the pop and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="837.75" dur="5.43">seeing many many different signs of this</text>
  <text start="839.31" dur="5.91">I mean as we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on this</text>
  <text start="843.18" dur="4.47">and we go back a couple of years when</text>
  <text start="845.22" dur="5.22">retail just started to do poorly</text>
  <text start="847.65" dur="5.1">people were saying no its online retail</text>
  <text start="850.44" dur="4.44">is really not doing that poorly housings</text>
  <text start="852.75" dur="4.98">not doing that bad it&amp;#39;s presumed pretty</text>
  <text start="854.88" dur="4.17">good you know and everyone was was out</text>
  <text start="857.73" dur="4.86">there saying that yeah it doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="859.05" dur="6.75">that bad fast forward to today we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.59" dur="5.58">having a retail apocalypse I mean the</text>
  <text start="865.8" dur="6.2">online sales are only ten percent of</text>
  <text start="868.17" dur="5.43">retail sales the housing market is</text>
  <text start="872" dur="4">falling apart</text>
  <text start="873.6" dur="4.35">outside of the 20 cities and once they</text>
  <text start="876" dur="3.84">fall apart outside of the 20 cities it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="877.95" dur="3.6">going to affect those 20 cities where</text>
  <text start="879.84" dur="4.92">they pumped up the bubbles the bubbles</text>
  <text start="881.55" dur="5.16">in Vancouver in Australia in the UK</text>
  <text start="884.76" dur="5.87">they&amp;#39;re starting to pop us on to see</text>
  <text start="886.71" dur="7.11">prices come down it&amp;#39;s all starting and</text>
  <text start="890.63" dur="5.71">it&amp;#39;s going to continue as we move</text>
  <text start="893.82" dur="4.41">forward and it&amp;#39;s going to accelerate</text>
  <text start="896.34" dur="3.9">actually we&amp;#39;ve been seeing it move very</text>
  <text start="898.23" dur="3.96">very quickly since we&amp;#39;ve been reporting</text>
  <text start="900.24" dur="4.71">on this because this is what happens it</text>
  <text start="902.19" dur="5.25">starts out very very slowly and once the</text>
  <text start="904.95" dur="4.89">dominoes start to fall it picks up speed</text>
  <text start="907.44" dur="4.08">and there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do to stop</text>
  <text start="909.84" dur="4.5">it and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="911.52" dur="4.8">for an event for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="914.34" dur="4.53">here we are at the endgame and they have</text>
  <text start="916.32" dur="4.47">no choice but to push for an event and</text>
  <text start="918.87" dur="3.93">this is why we&amp;#39;re gonna see them really</text>
  <text start="920.79" dur="4.11">push right now especially when we go</text>
  <text start="922.8" dur="3.9">into the new year because this holiday</text>
  <text start="924.9" dur="4.26">season is going to be complete disaster</text>
  <text start="926.7" dur="4.38">and they&amp;#39;re gonna have a choice either</text>
  <text start="929.16" dur="4.08">they have an event or everything is</text>
  <text start="931.08" dur="6.92">blamed on them and the truth is out</text>
  <text start="933.24" dur="7.8">there and they&amp;#39;re gonna be on the run so</text>
  <text start="938" dur="5.89">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="941.04" dur="6.03">beginning stages of the collapse and</text>
  <text start="943.89" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s going to get worse as we move to</text>
  <text start="947.07" dur="3.81">the end of this year to the beginning of</text>
  <text start="948.69" dur="4.41">next year and this is why you need to be</text>
  <text start="950.88" dur="4.74">ready because at any moment everything</text>
  <text start="953.1" dur="4.95">could come down in a split second</text>
  <text start="955.62" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;ll be no warning really it will</text>
