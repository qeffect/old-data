  <text start="56.53" dur="4.92">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.94" dur="6.36">episode 1379 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.45" dur="5.76">September 15th 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.3" dur="5.76">episode is GDP has revised much lower as</text>
  <text start="67.21" dur="4.65">economic indicators worsen let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="70.06" dur="4.44">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="71.86" dur="5.88">news now as we can see the economy well</text>
  <text start="74.5" dur="5.04">a lot of the economic indicators they</text>
  <text start="77.74" dur="3.75">are deteriorating and it looks like</text>
  <text start="79.54" dur="3.03">we&amp;#39;re getting a lot of revisions coming</text>
  <text start="81.49" dur="4.05">in and of course they&amp;#39;re blaming the</text>
  <text start="82.57" dur="4.53">Hurricanes for most of this and we can</text>
  <text start="85.54" dur="2.25">see that this has been going on for</text>
  <text start="87.1" dur="2.49">quite a while</text>
  <text start="87.79" dur="3.99">the Hurricanes aren&amp;#39;t going to make the</text>
  <text start="89.59" dur="5.1">economy all of a sudden go down the</text>
  <text start="91.78" dur="4.89">tubes because it hit Texas or it hit</text>
  <text start="94.69" dur="5.1">Florida the rest of the country was not</text>
  <text start="96.67" dur="4.35">hit so this is kind of ridiculous at</text>
  <text start="99.79" dur="3.719">this point but they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="101.02" dur="4.739">build this up and make it seem like this</text>
  <text start="103.509" dur="4.681">is the main problem of why the economy</text>
  <text start="105.759" dur="4.801">is not doing well now the you Mitch</text>
  <text start="108.19" dur="4.02">which is the University of Michigan&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="110.56" dur="4.38">headline consumer confidence index it</text>
  <text start="112.21" dur="4.5">slipped lower in September from ninety</text>
  <text start="114.94" dur="4.769">six point eight to ninety five point</text>
  <text start="116.71" dur="5.49">three and what has happened is basically</text>
  <text start="119.709" dur="4.44">Hope has tumbled right now people are</text>
  <text start="122.2" dur="4.05">looking at the economy looking at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="124.149" dur="4.89">been going on and they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="126.25" dur="4.619">realize there are problems now does this</text>
  <text start="129.039" dur="3.721">mean that everyone in the country</text>
  <text start="130.869" dur="3.811">believes this no there&amp;#39;s a lot there I</text>
  <text start="132.76" dur="4.199">would say a big portion of the country</text>
  <text start="134.68" dur="3.99">that thinks yes the economy is going to</text>
  <text start="136.959" dur="4.021">be doing well it&amp;#39;s going to be doing</text>
  <text start="138.67" dur="4.47">better and things are going to improve</text>
  <text start="140.98" dur="3.69">but what we&amp;#39;re really seeing is that</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="3.63">things are starting to break down now we</text>
  <text start="144.67" dur="4.8">mentioned yesterday about retail how</text>
  <text start="146.77" dur="5.34">retail is not doing that well and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.47" dur="4.62">starting to break down even further and</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="3.69">we see on the corporate media they have</text>
  <text start="154.09" dur="3.36">to report that there&amp;#39;s something wrong</text>
  <text start="155.8" dur="2.909">with media and they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="3.66">that retail sales</text>
  <text start="158.709" dur="3.331">well then unexpectedly I like what I</text>
  <text start="161.11" dur="3.78">like when they use that term</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="4.59">unexpectedly fell in August what we know</text>
  <text start="164.89" dur="3.42">why they fell in love is it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="166.63" dur="3.99">because of the hurricanes it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="168.31" dur="4.649">people are just not spending people are</text>
  <text start="170.62" dur="4.05">losing their jobs and basically they</text>
  <text start="172.959" dur="4.321">reported that sales have dropped by 0.2</text>
  <text start="174.67" dur="5.819">percent more dacovia motor vehicle sales</text>
  <text start="177.28" dur="5.67">have tumbled by 1.6 percent and we see</text>
  <text start="180.489" dur="4.501">at this point that we are in big trouble</text>
  <text start="182.95" dur="3.21">right now we&amp;#39;re heading into the holiday</text>
  <text start="184.99" dur="2.61">season and</text>
  <text start="186.16" dur="3.33">every holiday season that we looked at</text>
  <text start="187.6" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s just gotten worse and worse and</text>
  <text start="189.49" dur="3.63">worse and when you think about this the</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="5.58">unemployment numbers have come down but</text>
  <text start="193.12" dur="4.71">sales have also declined at the same or</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="3.96">faster pace</text>
  <text start="197.83" dur="7.38">so there are problems now why is this a</text>
  <text start="200.71" dur="7.08">problem why is this happening well there</text>
  <text start="205.21" dur="4.98">are a couple reports out there and we</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="5.01">can see that Americans right now they</text>
  <text start="210.19" dur="6.09">are scraping by with almost no money in</text>
  <text start="212.8" dur="5.55">their savings account now the st. Louis</text>
  <text start="216.28" dur="4.65">Federal Reserve said the personal</text>
  <text start="218.35" dur="5.39">savings rate in June of 2017 was a</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="5.73">measly three point eight percent or</text>
  <text start="223.74" dur="6.01">three dollars and 80 cents for every one</text>
  <text start="226.66" dur="5.07">hundred these people earn with the</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="4.38">medium household income in the u.s. at</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="4.65">just north of around fifty thousand</text>
  <text start="234.13" dur="4.71">dollars that would amount to about four</text>
  <text start="236.38" dur="4.38">thousand dollars a year now another</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="3.9">study from go banking rates found that</text>
  <text start="240.76" dur="5.13">69 percent of Americans surveyed had</text>
  <text start="242.74" dur="6.05">less than 1,000 in savings and about</text>
  <text start="245.89" dur="7.5">one-third had no money in reserve now</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="8.919">remember the US economy is based on 70</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="6.96">percent of consumption the GDP is based</text>
  <text start="257.709" dur="4.981">on the people going out and spending on</text>
  <text start="260.35" dur="4.74">retail so people are not spending</text>
  <text start="262.69" dur="4.83">because spending is down people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="265.09" dur="4.92">saving there is a major problem now</text>
  <text start="267.52" dur="5.34">people have been ramping up and putting</text>
  <text start="270.01" dur="5.22">a lot of money on their credit cards</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="4.8">because this is the only way they can</text>
  <text start="275.23" dur="5.07">survive now the Federal Reserve their</text>
  <text start="277.66" dur="5.55">data shows that the aggregate credit</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="4.95">card debt had hit an all-time high of</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="4.62">about one point zero to seven trillion</text>
  <text start="285.25" dur="7.32">dollars so when we put all this together</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="8.07">it shows that people cannot save people</text>
  <text start="292.57" dur="5.91">cannot spend and people have to put</text>
  <text start="295.9" dur="5.94">whatever they possibly can to survive on</text>
  <text start="298.48" dur="4.95">their credit card why is this well</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="303.43" dur="5.88">jobs or people making a lot less money</text>
  <text start="305.29" dur="5.91">than they used to and again we can see</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="4.01">this from everywhere we look I mean look</text>
  <text start="311.2" dur="5.49">at retail look at the housing market</text>
  <text start="313.32" dur="6.03">look at what is going on around the</text>
  <text start="316.69" dur="5.72">country because people</text>
  <text start="319.35" dur="5.22">they just can&amp;#39;t find those high-paying</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="4.05">jobs even though they&amp;#39;re telling us the</text>
  <text start="324.57" dur="4.37">unemployment numbers are very very low</text>
  <text start="326.46" dur="6.51">that we&amp;#39;re almost at full employment</text>
  <text start="328.94" dur="6.73">capacity it makes no sense now when we</text>
  <text start="332.97" dur="4.98">look at the housing market we can see</text>
  <text start="335.67" dur="4.74">and this is coming from Adam data</text>
  <text start="337.95" dur="4.86">solutions they released some information</text>
  <text start="340.41" dur="4.98">about home flipping and we saw this back</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="4.34">in 2008 where there were a lot of people</text>
  <text start="345.39" dur="3.99">flipping homes they go to those areas</text>
  <text start="347.15" dur="4.15">where there these houses are</text>
  <text start="349.38" dur="3.72">appreciating very very quickly they</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="3.45">purchased the house and they go ahead</text>
  <text start="353.1" dur="4.11">and they flip them so these people once</text>
  <text start="354.75" dur="5.58">again are out there and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="357.21" dur="5.79">the same exact thing now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="360.33" dur="6.21">interesting about this is that one in</text>
  <text start="363" dur="8.69">four home sales are flips in a certain</text>
  <text start="366.54" dur="8.79">number of cities or areas and those</text>
  <text start="371.69" dur="5.56">correlate to those areas where</text>
  <text start="375.33" dur="3.99">case-shiller shows that houses are</text>
  <text start="377.25" dur="4.35">moving up in prices I mean if we look we</text>
  <text start="379.32" dur="3.81">could see that Miami is one of them</text>
  <text start="381.6" dur="3.27">Washington is one of them New York is</text>
  <text start="383.13" dur="4.53">one of them Los Angeles is one of them</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="4.89">Philadelphia is one of them and they are</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="3.48">basically going in because houses are</text>
  <text start="389.76" dur="3.63">appreciating they got bubbles in these</text>
  <text start="391.14" dur="4.86">areas and they are flipping the homes</text>
  <text start="393.39" dur="5.07">now more than 35% of the homes flipped</text>
  <text start="396" dur="5.04">in the second quarter of 20 2017 were</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="4.68">purchased by the flipper with financing</text>
  <text start="401.04" dur="4.44">up from thirty three point two percent</text>
  <text start="403.14" dur="4.02">in the previous quarter and up from</text>
  <text start="405.48" dur="4.41">thirty two point three percent a year</text>
  <text start="407.16" dur="5.96">ago to the highest level since the third</text>
  <text start="409.89" dur="7.47">quarter of 2008 this is nearly a</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="8.62">nine-year high we are back to where we</text>
  <text start="417.36" dur="6.6">were in 2008 we&amp;#39;re running into the same</text>
  <text start="421.74" dur="6.09">exact problems they created these</text>
  <text start="423.96" dur="5.91">bubbles they created the illusion that</text>
  <text start="427.83" dur="3.9">the economy is doing well these people</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="3.96">are out flipping and guess what happens</text>
  <text start="431.73" dur="4.53">when the economy turns down all these</text>
  <text start="433.83" dur="4.2">people are in trouble because traffic</text>
  <text start="436.26" dur="3.15">will dry up if they have two or three</text>
  <text start="438.03" dur="3.78">four flips that they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="439.41" dur="5.04">guess what they can&amp;#39;t move them they are</text>
  <text start="441.81" dur="5.22">stuck with them well we see right now</text>
  <text start="444.45" dur="5.13">from Morgan Stanley well there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="447.03" dur="3.87">problem in Manhattan residential real</text>
  <text start="449.58" dur="2.88">estate it looks like it&amp;#39;s headed for a</text>
  <text start="450.9" dur="2.419">crash now we reported on this once</text>
  <text start="452.46" dur="2.449">before</text>
  <text start="453.319" dur="3.75">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="454.909" dur="4.201">it is not doing well whatsoever</text>
  <text start="457.069" dur="5.611">New York City&amp;#39;s commercial real estate</text>
  <text start="459.11" dur="6.6">market well that is not doing well and</text>
  <text start="462.68" dur="5.43">we could see that all these properties</text>
  <text start="465.71" dur="4.47">that have been purchased by Chinese</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="4.109">corporations and other foreign foreign</text>
  <text start="470.18" dur="4.199">entities well this is starting to dry up</text>
  <text start="472.219" dur="4.26">especially from China because now</text>
  <text start="474.379" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re diverting all their funds and</text>
  <text start="476.479" dur="3.71">they&amp;#39;re using therefore the Belton Road</text>
  <text start="477.889" dur="5.55">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="480.189" dur="5.77">there&amp;#39;s an 84 percent drop in over</text>
  <text start="483.439" dur="5.581">seized property investment by Chinese</text>
  <text start="485.959" dur="6.3">corporations during this year and</text>
  <text start="489.02" dur="7.919">another 18% will most likely happen in</text>
  <text start="492.259" dur="5.91">2018 now this is a huge decline and this</text>
  <text start="496.939" dur="3.421">is hitting the commercial real estate</text>
  <text start="498.169" dur="4.8">this is hitting the residential real</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="7.41">estate area and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="502.969" dur="7.26">now is that the entire Manhattan area</text>
  <text start="507.77" dur="5.579">San Francisco and many other cities</text>
  <text start="510.229" dur="5.881">they&amp;#39;re starting to see a downturn in</text>
  <text start="513.349" dur="5.581">rents a downturn in people purchasing</text>
  <text start="516.11" dur="5.07">these homes we&amp;#39;re seeing prices they are</text>
  <text start="518.93" dur="4.169">coming down we&amp;#39;re seeing the vacancy</text>
  <text start="521.18" dur="5.01">rate it has climbed from 2 point 2 / 7</text>
  <text start="523.099" dur="5.401">percent from 2 point 1 4 percent a year</text>
  <text start="526.19" dur="7.769">earlier and this is the first annual</text>
  <text start="528.5" dur="8.899">increase since February and we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="533.959" dur="6.62">into a a whole mess of trouble here</text>
  <text start="537.399" dur="7.091">another troubling sign in Manhattan is</text>
  <text start="540.579" dur="6.041">real estate developers rents in August</text>
  <text start="544.49" dur="4.5">declined in almost every minute Hatton</text>
  <text start="546.62" dur="5.13">neighborhood condo sales dropped by 11</text>
  <text start="548.99" dur="4.98">percent compared to last year at this</text>
  <text start="551.75" dur="5.459">time and we can see the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="553.97" dur="6.63">just imploding on itself and this is how</text>
  <text start="557.209" dur="6.18">it begins now remember the New York Fed</text>
  <text start="560.6" dur="5.07">the Atlanta Fed they were out there they</text>
  <text start="563.389" dur="3.3">were estimating the GDP numbers they</text>
  <text start="565.67" dur="4.109">were saying they were going to be around</text>
  <text start="566.689" dur="5.34">4% 3.8 percent they said it was going to</text>
  <text start="569.779" dur="5.341">be fantastic and now they can use the</text>
  <text start="572.029" dur="4.711">excuse of the hurricanes to say well you</text>
  <text start="575.12" dur="3.659">know something maybe these were too high</text>
  <text start="576.74" dur="4.099">let&amp;#39;s bring them back down</text>
  <text start="578.779" dur="5.31">and of course we&amp;#39;re getting other</text>
  <text start="580.839" dur="5.921">information from retail from housing</text>
  <text start="584.089" dur="3.24">from everywhere else that the economy is</text>
  <text start="586.76" dur="2.879">not doing</text>
  <text start="587.329" dur="4.5">well so they readjusted their GDP</text>
  <text start="589.639" dur="5.43">numbers they brought it down from almost</text>
  <text start="591.829" dur="6.211">4% we are now down to around 2.2 percent</text>
  <text start="595.069" dur="4.411">more in line of where we&amp;#39;ve seen in the</text>
  <text start="598.04" dur="3.659">past and actually this is probably gonna</text>
  <text start="599.48" dur="3.899">go a little bit lower than this and who</text>
  <text start="601.699" dur="3.63">knows I might revise the whole thing we</text>
  <text start="603.379" dur="3.87">know this is completely manipulated so</text>
  <text start="605.329" dur="3.781">at this point what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="607.249" dur="3.81">showing us makes no difference if we go</text>
  <text start="609.11" dur="3.899">to shadow stats we can see the real GDP</text>
  <text start="611.059" dur="4.56">numbers well they&amp;#39;re around the negative</text>
  <text start="613.009" dur="4.74">area right now and I&amp;#39;m sure that this is</text>
  <text start="615.619" dur="4.95">gonna go below 2% just like it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="617.749" dur="5.82">for the last many many years we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="620.569" dur="3.27">really hit 3% or 4% that&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="623.569" dur="2.43">gone</text>
  <text start="623.839" dur="3.66">remember they manipulated the GDP</text>
  <text start="625.999" dur="2.37">numbers they went all the way back to</text>
  <text start="627.499" dur="3.15">1929</text>
  <text start="628.369" dur="5.4">they included research and development</text>
  <text start="630.649" dur="5.461">they massage the numbers they added</text>
  <text start="633.769" dur="4.29">Obama care I mean they did whatever they</text>
  <text start="636.11" dur="3.599">possibly can to bring these numbers up</text>
  <text start="638.059" dur="4.08">but we could see right now that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="639.709" dur="4.261">completely falling apart and these four</text>
  <text start="642.139" dur="3.331">percent GDP numbers we knew that this</text>
  <text start="643.97" dur="3.69">was completely fake phony and false but</text>
  <text start="645.47" dur="4.109">they do have an excuse they&amp;#39;re gonna use</text>
  <text start="647.66" dur="3.839">the Hurricanes as the excuse but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="649.579" dur="3.93">really happening is the economy is still</text>
  <text start="651.499" dur="4.32">on that down downward trend that</text>
  <text start="653.509" dur="4.8">downward slide and it&amp;#39;s not improving</text>
  <text start="655.819" dur="4.77">whatsoever we see that no one really</text>
  <text start="658.309" dur="4.08">cares about the debt nobody really cares</text>
  <text start="660.589" dur="5.521">about how much debt there is in the</text>
  <text start="662.389" dur="5.69">system and we as a nation we are going</text>
  <text start="666.11" dur="4.769">broke I mean total US public debt</text>
  <text start="668.079" dur="6.19">remember it just hit twenty point one</text>
  <text start="670.879" dur="5.55">trillion dollars now after Congress</text>
  <text start="674.269" dur="4.68">suspended the debt limit last Friday the</text>
  <text start="676.429" dur="4.77">Treasury went ahead and reported 300</text>
  <text start="678.949" dur="3.901">billion of off-balance</text>
  <text start="681.199" dur="4.021">spending they run up over the last six</text>
  <text start="682.85" dur="4.829">months since hitting the debt ceiling in</text>
  <text start="685.22" dur="4.619">March so at thirty four thousand eight</text>
  <text start="687.679" dur="4.47">hundred eighty dollars of new debt per</text>
  <text start="689.839" dur="4.74">second the federal government is running</text>
  <text start="692.149" dur="4.711">up the debt at speeds that are over that</text>
  <text start="694.579" dur="4.32">like the speed of light here and they</text>
  <text start="696.86" dur="3.719">have gotten completely out of control</text>
  <text start="698.899" dur="3.03">and guess what they&amp;#39;re gonna have to do</text>
  <text start="700.579" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to spend more and</text>
  <text start="701.929" dur="5.46">more and more we see that industrial</text>
  <text start="704.929" dur="5.07">production it took a dive at that point</text>
  <text start="707.389" dur="4.86">nine percent and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="709.999" dur="5.13">they expected that this was going to be</text>
  <text start="712.249" dur="5.7">again but it wasn&amp;#39;t it was a drop in</text>
  <text start="715.129" dur="6.481">industrial production and here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="717.949" dur="7.381">kicker this number that is coming</text>
  <text start="721.61" dur="6.9">it&amp;#39;s not based on the hurricane it was</text>
  <text start="725.33" dur="7.1">already negative without the impact of</text>
  <text start="728.51" dur="8.76">the Hurricanes so this is another area</text>
  <text start="732.43" dur="8.77">which shows that the economy industrial</text>
  <text start="737.27" dur="5.67">production GDP retail sales housing this</text>
  <text start="741.2" dur="4.91">has nothing to do with the bad weather</text>
  <text start="742.94" dur="7.35">this has to do with the constant</text>
  <text start="746.11" dur="7.15">deterioration of the economy the economy</text>
  <text start="750.29" dur="5.1">is not improving it&amp;#39;s getting worse the</text>
  <text start="753.26" dur="6.21">debt is continually rising actually the</text>
  <text start="755.39" dur="7.02">Adept are pace than it ever has before</text>
  <text start="759.47" dur="5.19">and we see right now there&amp;#39;s nothing the</text>
  <text start="762.41" dur="4.53">government nothing Trump nothing anyone</text>
  <text start="764.66" dur="4.5">can do about this because the system</text>
  <text start="766.94" dur="4.83">cannot be sustained think about your</text>
  <text start="769.16" dur="3.93">household if you were making say fifty</text>
  <text start="771.77" dur="2.37">thousand dollars a year let&amp;#39;s just use</text>
  <text start="773.09" dur="3">that as a base and you weren&amp;#39;t getting</text>
  <text start="774.14" dur="4.65">any raises or anything like that but</text>
  <text start="776.09" dur="5.22">everything was going up your auto</text>
  <text start="778.79" dur="5.52">insurance your health insurance your</text>
  <text start="781.31" dur="5.52">rent was going up or if you own a house</text>
  <text start="784.31" dur="4.05">your taxes were going up and all the</text>
  <text start="786.83" dur="2.94">other expenses food and everything else</text>
  <text start="788.36" dur="3.51">was going up and you&amp;#39;re only making a</text>
  <text start="789.77" dur="4.68">certain amount of funds coming into the</text>
  <text start="791.87" dur="4.29">home guess what would happen you would</text>
  <text start="794.45" dur="4.17">have to borrow some money to make up the</text>
  <text start="796.16" dur="4.41">difference and as the cost of everything</text>
  <text start="798.62" dur="3.33">continually rises you&amp;#39;d have to borrow</text>
  <text start="800.57" dur="3.21">some more then you have interest</text>
  <text start="801.95" dur="3.15">payments on that you&amp;#39;d have to borrow</text>
  <text start="803.78" dur="2.91">some more to make up for the interest</text>
  <text start="805.1" dur="4.17">payments to pay for the things that are</text>
  <text start="806.69" dur="6.12">going up and this cycle cannot be ended</text>
  <text start="809.27" dur="6.36">it just continues and you&amp;#39;ll be taking</text>
  <text start="812.81" dur="6.96">on more debt and eventually what happens</text>
  <text start="815.63" dur="6.42">everything gets out of whack you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="819.77" dur="4.08">do it anymore you don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="822.05" dur="4.14">money coming in you can&amp;#39;t survive you</text>
  <text start="823.85" dur="4.56">can&amp;#39;t borrow anymore and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="826.19" dur="5.58">happening to the US government the debt</text>
  <text start="828.41" dur="6.03">level is increasing that tax revenues</text>
  <text start="831.77" dur="4.14">instead of saying even they are falling</text>
  <text start="834.44" dur="3.69">so they&amp;#39;re not bringing in the same</text>
  <text start="835.91" dur="5.61">amount of tax revenue because people</text>
  <text start="838.13" dur="6.09">really don&amp;#39;t have jobs and as the debt</text>
  <text start="841.52" dur="4.77">Rises and as the cost of all these</text>
  <text start="844.22" dur="4.59">programs go up and guess what happens</text>
  <text start="846.29" dur="6.36">everything falls apart as people lose</text>
  <text start="848.81" dur="6.18">their jobs GDP and everything else falls</text>
  <text start="852.65" dur="3.99">apart this is why this can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="854.99" dur="5.099">Stane this is why they&amp;#39;ve been creating</text>
  <text start="856.64" dur="5.31">and printing money as fast as they</text>
  <text start="860.089" dur="3.541">possibly can this is why the Fed is out</text>
  <text start="861.95" dur="3.57">there with stimulus this is why the ECB</text>
  <text start="863.63" dur="5.01">is out there with stimulus because they</text>
