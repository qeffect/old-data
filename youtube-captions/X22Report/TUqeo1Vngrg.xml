  <text start="75.39" dur="5.91">really starting to accelerate at this</text>
  <text start="77.91" dur="5.94">point we see the economy it is coming</text>
  <text start="81.3" dur="4.59">down very very quickly the economic</text>
  <text start="83.85" dur="5.909">indicators are pointing to a</text>
  <text start="85.89" dur="8.78">deterioration of each economic sector</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="8.28">and it is not improving we see that</text>
  <text start="94.67" dur="6.03">events around the world are accelerating</text>
  <text start="98.039" dur="4.951">we&amp;#39;re seeing false Flags accelerate and</text>
  <text start="100.7" dur="5.649">we know we just had that recent false</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="8.54">flag in Nice France where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="106.349" dur="7.77">this driver who was radicalized who was</text>
  <text start="111.53" dur="5.11">part of the Islamic state and by the way</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="3.75">that whole story is falling apart but</text>
  <text start="116.64" dur="3.99">showing that he had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="6">the Islamic state and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="6.78">right now is they&amp;#39;re using whatever they</text>
  <text start="123.869" dur="6.42">possibly can or they&amp;#39;re creating these</text>
  <text start="127.41" dur="8.12">instances to try to scare more and more</text>
  <text start="130.289" dur="9.391">people now out in France we realize that</text>
  <text start="135.53" dur="6.099">Colin was going to remove the state of</text>
  <text start="139.68" dur="4.38">emergency now the state of emergency was</text>
  <text start="141.629" dur="6.171">in effect at this time and it did</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="5.94">absolutely nothing to help the situation</text>
  <text start="147.8" dur="5.079">because if we believe their official</text>
  <text start="150" dur="4.709">stories each time these things happen</text>
  <text start="152.879" dur="3.75">and each time they tell us oh we need to</text>
  <text start="154.709" dur="4.411">have this in place so we need to have</text>
  <text start="156.629" dur="4.92">that in place if you notice none of it</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="5.1">works now this time they didn&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="161.549" dur="4.831">weapons because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="4.02">getting such a backlash of everyone</text>
  <text start="166.38" dur="3.81">saying well if there are terrorists out</text>
  <text start="168.24" dur="4.71">there shouldn&amp;#39;t we all have weapons</text>
  <text start="170.19" dur="4.11">shouldn&amp;#39;t we protect ourselves and I</text>
  <text start="172.95" dur="3.66">think this is why they&amp;#39;re changing</text>
  <text start="174.3" dur="4.83">course at this point in time but very</text>
  <text start="176.61" dur="6.51">interestingly going back to November</text>
  <text start="179.13" dur="6.63">during the Paris terrorist attack the US</text>
  <text start="183.12" dur="6.72">and the fan the French decided you know</text>
  <text start="185.76" dur="8">what let&amp;#39;s start sharing our data let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="8.28">enhance our security they came together</text>
  <text start="193.76" dur="9.4">they created this model to share all the</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="9">information and look did it help once</text>
  <text start="203.16" dur="8.97">again no because most of these</text>
  <text start="207.12" dur="8.67">occurrences these events are created by</text>
  <text start="212.13" dur="6.78">the government&amp;#39;s by the different</text>
  <text start="215.79" dur="5.7">agencies in each of these countries to</text>
  <text start="218.91" dur="4.38">scare the people into doing things they</text>
  <text start="221.49" dur="4.2">normally wouldn&amp;#39;t do and that is going</text>
  <text start="223.29" dur="4.35">to give up their rights they&amp;#39;re used to</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="6.12">create more laws to take away rights</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="9.78">they&amp;#39;re used to give more power to the</text>
  <text start="231.81" dur="9.02">government that&amp;#39;s it now we see that the</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="7.47">US is in continuous talks with Russia</text>
  <text start="240.83" dur="7.98">trying to iron out this deal that the US</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="7.74">has and the question is why is the US</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="7.03">proposing a deal out of thin air just</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="5.49">like they create currency well one of</text>
  <text start="255.84" dur="4.92">the reasons is because their backs are</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="5.57">against the wall they lost their Islamic</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="7.53">state proxy army they lost the edge in</text>
  <text start="263.69" dur="6.82">Syria they&amp;#39;re losing and they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="268.29" dur="4.189">major problems in this area and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.51" dur="5.43">trying to keep their moderate forces</text>
  <text start="272.479" dur="6.701">intact so they&amp;#39;re making this deal to</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="6.289">collaborate against the terrorist</text>
  <text start="279.18" dur="8.13">organizations and part of the deal is</text>
  <text start="282.229" dur="7.661">that the Syrian Air Force it will need</text>
  <text start="287.31" dur="5.31">to be grounded during this period of</text>
  <text start="289.89" dur="6.679">time which is very interesting so think</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="7.46">about this the u.s. is saying that</text>
  <text start="296.569" dur="7.05">the Syrian Air Force which is the Air</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="7.069">Force for the country they are not</text>
  <text start="303.619" dur="9.05">allowed to fly their jets in their own</text>
  <text start="307.149" dur="9.06">country it&amp;#39;s like Mexico or Canada or</text>
  <text start="312.669" dur="6.911">any other country coming into the u.s.</text>
  <text start="316.209" dur="8.25">saying listen I know you have terrorists</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="8.399">running around there&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="324.459" dur="5.621">factions in your country but we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="327.979" dur="5.64">want you to fly your jets in your own</text>
  <text start="330.08" dur="7.069">country to get them which makes no sense</text>
  <text start="333.619" dur="6.72">whatsoever and we know the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="337.149" dur="6.091">pushing this proposal for a different</text>
  <text start="340.339" dur="6.12">purpose one it could be to save face</text>
  <text start="343.24" dur="6.25">because as we know they&amp;#39;re backed into a</text>
  <text start="346.459" dur="4.74">corner too they already know that this</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="3.419">proposal is going to go absolutely</text>
  <text start="351.199" dur="4.56">nowhere because it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="352.909" dur="5.49">demanding a lot and giving a little</text>
  <text start="355.759" dur="5.93">first of all there in Syria illegally</text>
  <text start="358.399" dur="7.56">they invaded a country and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.689" dur="6.76">pushing terms in this country but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="365.959" dur="4.591">have to see how this turns out and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="368.449" dur="6.96">have to watch this very carefully now</text>
  <text start="370.55" dur="6.869">out in turkey we understand this coup</text>
  <text start="375.409" dur="4.38">took place now in the beginning it</text>
  <text start="377.419" dur="4.65">seemed like it was a grassroots who the</text>
  <text start="379.789" dur="5.37">people were rising up but we come to</text>
  <text start="382.069" dur="7.08">find out this is not the case whatsoever</text>
  <text start="385.159" dur="5.521">and was very interesting is the US came</text>
  <text start="389.149" dur="4.56">right out and said we have no</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="7.199">intelligence no information about this</text>
  <text start="393.709" dur="6.93">upcoming coup we had no clue whatsoever</text>
  <text start="397.879" dur="6.12">this was going to happen which is a red</text>
  <text start="400.639" dur="6.39">flag right off the bat first of all if</text>
  <text start="403.999" dur="5.78">we believe them you mean those billions</text>
  <text start="407.029" dur="6.6">and billions of dollars they spend on</text>
  <text start="409.779" dur="7.81">surveillance spying and everything else</text>
  <text start="413.629" dur="7.35">is a complete waste of funds if they</text>
  <text start="417.589" dur="6.26">have no clue whatsoever but of course</text>
  <text start="420.979" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re out there saying this because</text>
  <text start="423.849" dur="5.571">there&amp;#39;s something else going on now</text>
  <text start="427.759" dur="5.201">right off the bat</text>
  <text start="429.42" dur="7.59">we see that irda one has accused his</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="8.13">arch enemy Fethullah Gulen who lives in</text>
  <text start="437.01" dur="8.4">saylorsburg Pennsylvania and right off</text>
  <text start="441.09" dur="8.07">the mat he said it had to be him and he</text>
  <text start="445.41" dur="6.84">blamed the united states that they were</text>
  <text start="449.16" dur="5.4">part of this coup now this is very</text>
  <text start="452.25" dur="4.65">interesting right off the bat now of</text>
  <text start="454.56" dur="5.12">course the United States Secretary of</text>
  <text start="456.9" dur="7.08">State John Kerry said the United States</text>
  <text start="459.68" dur="7.78">will help turkey investigate a failed</text>
  <text start="463.98" dur="5.67">coup and invited unkar to share any</text>
  <text start="467.46" dur="7.56">evidence it has against us-based</text>
  <text start="469.65" dur="7.95">opposition figure Fethullah Gulen now of</text>
  <text start="475.02" dur="4.41">course the US is saying we had no part</text>
  <text start="477.6" dur="4.53">of this we had no idea this was</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="7.14">happening and we can see the tensions</text>
  <text start="482.13" dur="9.09">between the US and Turkey they are</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="9.27">escalating right now the president came</text>
  <text start="491.22" dur="8.16">out Obama and said that all parties in</text>
  <text start="495.84" dur="9.33">Turkey should support the democratically</text>
  <text start="499.38" dur="9.12">elected government of Turkey and when we</text>
  <text start="505.17" dur="6.63">look at this and we try to make sense of</text>
  <text start="508.5" dur="8.09">this we see a lot of things happening</text>
  <text start="511.8" dur="9.06">right now now right in the beginning</text>
  <text start="516.59" dur="7.9">they shut down the Incirlik base which</text>
  <text start="520.86" dur="7.65">holds about 80 us nukes they shot the</text>
  <text start="524.49" dur="7.2">power they cut the power and right now</text>
  <text start="528.51" dur="7.2">we see that everything has been restored</text>
  <text start="531.69" dur="8.73">in that area during this time during the</text>
  <text start="535.71" dur="7.08">coup attempt we see us suspended all air</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="5.76">strikes from that base but is it looks</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="4.95">like they&amp;#39;re back on right now but</text>
  <text start="546.18" dur="5.31">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this whole</text>
  <text start="547.74" dur="8.52">entire thing is that when they</text>
  <text start="551.49" dur="9.42">questioned the soldiers afterwards the</text>
  <text start="556.26" dur="7.08">everyday soldier had no clue what was</text>
  <text start="560.91" dur="8.13">going on they were told</text>
  <text start="563.34" dur="9.32">this was a military exercise they had no</text>
  <text start="569.04" dur="6.06">idea this was a coup that was happening</text>
  <text start="572.66" dur="3.76">they had no idea that they were taking</text>
  <text start="575.1" dur="5.19">part and attempt to topple the</text>
  <text start="576.42" dur="5.25">government they realized that when</text>
  <text start="580.29" dur="3.66">people started climbing on the tanks</text>
  <text start="581.67" dur="7.16">they started to realize what was going</text>
  <text start="583.95" dur="10.4">on at this point now the entire thing</text>
  <text start="588.83" dur="5.52">seems highly dubious and very suspicious</text>
  <text start="594.71" dur="8.14">now as we can see her juan has remained</text>
  <text start="599.04" dur="5.58">in power we might not know every single</text>
  <text start="602.85" dur="4.56">detail at this point there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="604.62" dur="4.71">information coming out at each time but</text>
  <text start="607.41" dur="5.4">one of the takeaways from all of this is</text>
  <text start="609.33" dur="6.93">that her one is still in power and his</text>
  <text start="612.81" dur="6.39">grip on power was not weakened by the</text>
  <text start="616.26" dur="4.8">coup actually it was strengthened how</text>
  <text start="619.2" dur="5.37">was it strengthened well he&amp;#39;s beginning</text>
  <text start="621.06" dur="6.42">the purge he&amp;#39;s getting rid of generals</text>
  <text start="624.57" dur="7.32">he&amp;#39;s getting rid of judges all those</text>
  <text start="627.48" dur="6.87">that he suspects are against him but</text>
  <text start="631.89" dur="5.55">while this was going on media</text>
  <text start="634.35" dur="5.43">organizations like Dogon and her yet and</text>
  <text start="637.44" dur="5.76">others were still operating them putting</text>
  <text start="639.78" dur="7.56">out pro dhawan information including</text>
  <text start="643.2" dur="5.73">updating their websites long after they</text>
  <text start="647.34" dur="4.29">were supposedly seized by the coup</text>
  <text start="648.93" dur="5.01">plotters now this was very strange coup</text>
  <text start="651.63" dur="3.72">there were no apparent leaders no one</text>
  <text start="653.94" dur="4.77">came forward to make statements to the</text>
  <text start="655.35" dur="6.6">public or to try to garner support quite</text>
  <text start="658.71" dur="7.17">kick clearly even during the coup what</text>
  <text start="661.95" dur="6.72">do we really see we saw that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="665.88" dur="7.59">accuse him of a ver diwana of rigging</text>
  <text start="668.67" dur="7.89">elections of accepting bribes peddling</text>
  <text start="673.47" dur="6.05">Isis stolen oil and partnership with the</text>
  <text start="676.56" dur="5.55">Sun actually we&amp;#39;ve seen none of this</text>
  <text start="679.52" dur="6.9">after there was no leaders involved in</text>
  <text start="682.11" dur="7.05">this which is very odd in itself so</text>
  <text start="686.42" dur="9.1">turkey has accused the United States of</text>
  <text start="689.16" dur="7.82">an overt egregious act of war now</text>
  <text start="695.52" dur="2.869">considering the gravity of</text>
  <text start="696.98" dur="4.5">these accusations against the United</text>
  <text start="698.389" dur="8.19">States its actions so far have been</text>
  <text start="701.48" dur="6.78">disproportionately subdued now we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="706.579" dur="4.891">suggesting that turkey is going to go to</text>
  <text start="708.26" dur="5.79">war with the United States but even amid</text>
  <text start="711.47" dur="4.5">diplomatic rows of four lesser</text>
  <text start="714.05" dur="4.349">significance nations have expelled</text>
  <text start="715.97" dur="4.77">diplomats and withdrawn the use of their</text>
  <text start="718.399" dur="5.19">territory for specific uses by the</text>
  <text start="720.74" dur="5.43">nation in question turkey so far has</text>
  <text start="723.589" dur="4.081">done none of this in regards to the</text>
  <text start="726.17" dur="3.24">United States now they believe the</text>
  <text start="727.67" dur="4.8">United States was behind this but they</text>
  <text start="729.41" dur="6.869">have done nothing up to this point so in</text>
  <text start="732.47" dur="8.63">the upcoming weeks should turkey fail to</text>
  <text start="736.279" dur="4.821">take even those most basic steps of</text>
  <text start="741.82" dur="6.94">removing those individuals in the</text>
  <text start="744.949" dur="8.94">country maybe cutting access to their</text>
  <text start="748.76" dur="7.889">insular base well it might appear at</text>
  <text start="753.889" dur="5.431">that point that turkeys accusations are</text>
  <text start="756.649" dur="6.24">complete distraction but we have to ask</text>
  <text start="759.32" dur="7.47">ourselves a distraction from what well</text>
  <text start="762.889" dur="7.56">we see that turkey is purging they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="766.79" dur="7.25">gotten rid of many of those people that</text>
  <text start="770.449" dur="8.151">were implicated in the failed coup and</text>
  <text start="774.04" dur="9.01">we see arrests have risen to about 6,000</text>
  <text start="778.6" dur="10">he&amp;#39;s also gone in and gotten rid of</text>
  <text start="783.05" dur="12.08">about 2700 judges and we can see right</text>
  <text start="788.6" dur="10.44">now that he&amp;#39;s giving himself more power</text>
  <text start="795.13" dur="8.709">so if the world is expected to believe</text>
  <text start="799.04" dur="8.81">what happened in Turkey regarding the</text>
  <text start="803.839" dur="9.62">u.s. involvement in this recent coup</text>
  <text start="807.85" dur="11.049">turkey must in the end follow through in</text>
  <text start="813.459" dur="6.521">cutting off ties with the US and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="818.899" dur="5.561">going to have to watch this very</text>
  <text start="819.98" dur="9.82">carefully now if</text>
