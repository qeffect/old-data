  <text start="82.24" dur="4.2">indicators well they&amp;#39;re not doing well</text>
  <text start="84.43" dur="4.83">yesterday we reported on how these</text>
  <text start="86.44" dur="7.02">retail numbers are completely falsified</text>
  <text start="89.26" dur="7.26">if they don&amp;#39;t fit a certain model and we</text>
  <text start="93.46" dur="7.49">understand that GDP the unemployment</text>
  <text start="96.52" dur="4.43">they are completely manipulated into</text>
  <text start="101.43" dur="7.03">telling the story of what the government</text>
  <text start="106.72" dur="4.92">wants everyone to believe and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="108.46" dur="7.049">economy is doing well it has recovered</text>
  <text start="111.64" dur="6.72">and leading up to the election we saw</text>
  <text start="115.509" dur="5.811">that they really push this hard they got</text>
  <text start="118.36" dur="6.69">GDP up to two point nine percent by</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="5.68">exporting soybeans which means this is a</text>

  <text start="127" dur="4.04">unemployment came down to four point</text>
  <text start="128.71" dur="7.32">nine percent and they are creating this</text>
  <text start="131.04" dur="8.17">entire fake economy where it shows that</text>
  <text start="136.03" dur="5.37">obama brought us out of the Great</text>

  <text start="144.33" dur="7.84">right before the holiday season</text>
  <text start="146.88" dur="9.22">Thanksgiving the stock market sword to</text>
  <text start="152.17" dur="8.22">nineteen thousand points and we can see</text>
  <text start="156.1" dur="7.46">that this entire illusion is going to</text>
  <text start="160.39" dur="6.42">fall apart it&amp;#39;s going to collapse and</text>
  <text start="163.56" dur="6.25">people are going to be shocked when it</text>
  <text start="166.81" dur="6.09">happens because we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="169.81" dur="7.53">all the economic indicators this reminds</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="5.94">me so much of 2008 where those few</text>
  <text start="177.34" dur="3.539">individuals we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="178.84" dur="3.39">subprime securities and they were</text>
  <text start="180.879" dur="3.181">looking at it saying</text>
  <text start="182.23" dur="4.02">listen the inner workings of these</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="4.08">securities they are completely garbage</text>
  <text start="186.25" dur="4.26">there is no way they can be a triple-a</text>
  <text start="188.14" dur="3.78">this makes no sense whatsoever and then</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="4.5">they put timelines where they thought</text>
  <text start="191.92" dur="4.649">that they thought that the securities</text>
  <text start="195.01" dur="2.94">were going to crash and they didn&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="196.569" dur="5.221">they were like what&amp;#39;s going on here this</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="6.179">makes no sense well we&amp;#39;re back in that</text>
  <text start="201.79" dur="3.809">area where we&amp;#39;re looking at the economic</text>
  <text start="204.129" dur="3.931">indicators we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="205.599" dur="4.741">manufacturing we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="5.58">Dallas Fed the Chicago Fed the New York</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="4.679">the empire state manufacturing all of it</text>
  <text start="213.64" dur="3.12">I mean we&amp;#39;re just looking at the retail</text>
  <text start="215.019" dur="3.661">numbers how they are completely</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="3.9">falsified we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="4.889">manipulated unemployment we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="220.66" dur="5.219">at the manipulated GDP we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="223.569" dur="4.801">every single piece of indicator the</text>
  <text start="225.879" dur="5.901">number of people that got laid off the</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="5.61">number of stores that are closing and</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="3.459">we&amp;#39;re looking at all this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.98" dur="6.68">scratching our heads and we&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="235.239" dur="11.06">this economy is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="240.66" dur="8.68">it&amp;#39;s collapsing but the illusion that</text>
  <text start="246.299" dur="6.28">everything is fine is out there and</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="6.239">people are believing it they realize</text>
  <text start="252.579" dur="5.701">that hey look the stock market it</text>
  <text start="255.579" dur="5.34">continually moves up the Treasury</text>
  <text start="258.28" dur="6.69">secretary said that Obama brought us out</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="9.18">of this great recession and we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="264.97" dur="9.72">this recovery well this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="270.099" dur="7.771">happened once before actually Draghi is</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="5.159">out there using the word contained now</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="5.54">when they start using these type of</text>
  <text start="279.849" dur="6.811">terms you should start to get scared</text>
  <text start="283.41" dur="6.729">because that means that things are going</text>
  <text start="286.66" dur="5.25">to rapidly deteriorate very quickly we</text>
  <text start="290.139" dur="5.191">saw existing home sales well they just</text>
  <text start="291.91" dur="5.1">all of a sudden surged from those low</text>
  <text start="295.33" dur="3.149">mortgage rates but guess what the</text>
  <text start="297.01" dur="3.27">mortgage rates creeped up a little bit</text>
  <text start="298.479" dur="5.791">and guess what happened mortgage</text>
  <text start="300.28" dur="6.03">applications plunged and we know that</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="4.019">this housing mark has just been bouncing</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="5.57">around and think about what they had to</text>
  <text start="308.289" dur="7.35">do to keep this housing market alive</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="6.249">they had to bring the rates so low</text>
  <text start="315.639" dur="4.56">just to keep things operational they had</text>
  <text start="318.129" dur="5.01">to have hedge funds investment companies</text>
  <text start="320.199" dur="5.761">come in and purchase thousands upon</text>
  <text start="323.139" dur="4.62">thousands of homes rent them if he can</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="4.979">just hold on to him they had to have the</text>
  <text start="327.759" dur="5.4">banks hold on to foreclosures and say</text>
  <text start="330.939" dur="4.431">listen don&amp;#39;t let them out on the market</text>
  <text start="333.159" dur="6.361">let the people stay in their homes and</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="6.849">they did this from 2008 moving forward</text>
  <text start="339.52" dur="9.239">and now things are starting to really</text>
  <text start="342.219" dur="9.901">fall apart we see that the wealth of the</text>
  <text start="348.759" dur="6.78">entire world has been sucked up from all</text>
  <text start="352.12" dur="6.269">the people and it has brought up to the</text>
  <text start="355.539" dur="7.141">point seven percent of adults now they</text>
  <text start="358.389" dur="6.721">control 116 trillion dollars in well</text>
  <text start="362.68" dur="5.299">this is coming from credit Swiss it</text>
  <text start="365.11" dur="5.76">released its annual Global Wealth Report</text>
  <text start="367.979" dur="4.331">which traditionally lays out what is</text>
  <text start="370.87" dur="4.28">perhaps the biggest reason for the</text>
  <text start="372.31" dur="6.479">recent anti-establishment revulsion</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="6.729">because there&amp;#39;s a concentration of 0</text>
  <text start="378.789" dur="7.38">point seven percent who control the</text>
  <text start="381.879" dur="9.27">wealth of the world and if you go back</text>
  <text start="386.169" dur="7.261">in time and we go back to 2010 where the</text>
  <text start="391.149" dur="5.031">total wealth of the top layer in the</text>
  <text start="393.43" dur="8.87">pyramid was about sixty nine trillion</text>
  <text start="396.18" dur="9.37">well it has doubled in six years</text>
  <text start="402.3" dur="7.989">meanwhile the world&amp;#39;s poorest have</text>
  <text start="405.55" dur="6.45">gotten poor and those adults who were</text>
  <text start="410.289" dur="5.13">worth less than ten thousand and twenty</text>
  <text start="412" dur="6.719">ten had a combined net worth of eight</text>
  <text start="415.419" dur="6.09">point two trillion a number which has</text>
  <text start="418.719" dur="6.57">declined to six point one trillion in</text>
  <text start="421.509" dur="7.951">2016 despite a half a billion increase</text>
  <text start="425.289" dur="7.28">in the sample size so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="7.769">right now is the wealth transfer is</text>
  <text start="432.569" dur="8.051">complete we can see right now they are</text>
  <text start="437.229" dur="6.201">building this illusion up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="440.62" dur="5.659">preparing for the economy to come down</text>
  <text start="443.43" dur="6.15">we understand going back a hundred years</text>

  <text start="456.37" dur="5.34">complete disaster and it crashes during</text>
  <text start="459.13" dur="6.12">this period and remember they were going</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="5.85">to have this crash no matter what it</text>
  <text start="465.25" dur="5.91">didn&amp;#39;t matter if it was Trump it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.56" dur="5.16">matter if it was Hillary because they</text>
