  <text start="119.89" dur="4.92">to maintain control over the entire</text>

  <text start="124.81" dur="2.49">the Patriots have been doing for quite a</text>
  <text start="126.76" dur="3.63">while now</text>
  <text start="127.3" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;ve been removing everything that</text>

  <text start="133.45" dur="7.08">many years ever since 1913 and yes it</text>
  <text start="136.629" dur="7.621">ramped up after 1971 when we went fully</text>
  <text start="140.53" dur="6.09">on a fiat system and then in 2008 they</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="5.459">really had to push this to the extreme</text>
  <text start="146.62" dur="5.94">with stimulus and lowering rates and now</text>
  <text start="149.709" dur="4.981">the Patriots they stepped in and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="158.019" dur="5.041">they&amp;#39;re calling the shots and we can see</text>
  <text start="160.599" dur="4.101">that the mainstream media the central</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="3.98">bank the deep state players</text>

  <text start="167.04" dur="5.22">Trump but it&amp;#39;s already failed before it</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="4.26">even started we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="6.03">in a little bit but first Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="174.63" dur="7.35">he is calling for a UK election on</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="6.39">December 12th and he said the way to get</text>
  <text start="181.98" dur="4.71">brexit done is to I think be reasonable</text>
  <text start="184.68" dur="3.99">with Parliament if they generally want</text>
  <text start="186.69" dur="4.11">more time to study this excellent deal</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="4.02">they can have it but they have to agree</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="5.1">to a general election on December 12th</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="4.74">it is time frankly that the Opposition</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="3.6">summoned up the nerve to submit</text>
  <text start="197.43" dur="4.8">themselves to the judgement of our</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="5.489">collective boss and who is the</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="7.229">collective boss it is the people of the</text>
  <text start="204.989" dur="7.711">UK and Boris Johnson is right and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.459" dur="8.071">pushing the elite the establishment the</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="5.75">EU into a corner Boris Johnson has the</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="5.85">upper hand</text>
  <text start="218.45" dur="11.08">except brexit eel or snap elections you</text>
  <text start="223.38" dur="10.41">decide beautifully played and before you</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="7.32">know it the UK is going to be separating</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="4.86">themselves from the EU now most likely</text>
  <text start="236.85" dur="3.359">this might even move into a No Deal</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="3.929">breakfast brexit we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="6.571">this all plays out but even if the deal</text>
  <text start="242.579" dur="5.63">does go through and they say yes let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="246.78" dur="5.429">do it</text>
  <text start="248.209" dur="8.081">inside this deal is a deal with the</text>
  <text start="252.209" dur="8.011">United States and there&amp;#39;s nothing the EU</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="7.35">can say about this so Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="6.54">Trump they do have the upper hand in all</text>
  <text start="263.64" dur="7.74">of this if it&amp;#39;s a No Deal brexit the UK</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="8.43">still wins the EU loses and the EU they</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="6.51">are losing Germany right now is sliding</text>
  <text start="275.19" dur="4.65">into a recession now think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.89" dur="4.26">happening now across the world</text>
  <text start="279.84" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;ve been blaming what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="5.49">happening in the United States and</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="5.93">around the world all on Trump because of</text>
  <text start="287.64" dur="6.029">the trade Wars but the United States</text>
  <text start="290.99" dur="3.46">statistically speaking is doing very</text>
  <text start="293.669" dur="3.131">very well</text>
  <text start="294.45" dur="5.35">the stock market is up</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="8.139">job numbers look great</text>
  <text start="299.8" dur="8.019">GDP numbers look fantastic and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="304.939" dur="4.5">trying to say that Trump is causing this</text>
  <text start="307.819" dur="6">well it&amp;#39;s not affecting the United</text>
  <text start="309.439" dur="8.581">States it&amp;#39;s affecting Germany the EU and</text>
  <text start="313.819" dur="7.921">I do believe this is what the Patriots</text>
  <text start="318.02" dur="6.599">want now in Germany the latest market</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="4.769">survey which was released confirm that</text>
  <text start="324.619" dur="6.3">Germany&amp;#39;s manufacturing recession</text>
  <text start="326.509" dur="6.99">continues to broaden and it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="330.919" dur="5.011">worse now this really has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="333.499" dur="5.581">with the trade wars this has to do with</text>
  <text start="335.93" dur="7.59">a central bank system that is imploding</text>
  <text start="339.08" dur="7.379">it is gone way beyond where it was</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="6.329">supposed to be they only last 40 to 50</text>
  <text start="346.459" dur="6.48">years at the most and then they start to</text>
  <text start="349.849" dur="4.261">implode from the weight of debt why do</text>
  <text start="352.939" dur="3.15">you think they lowered the interest</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="4.319">rates because if the interest rates are</text>
  <text start="356.089" dur="3.78">three four five six percent do you think</text>
  <text start="358.429" dur="5.19">any of these nations would be able to</text>
  <text start="359.869" dur="6.871">service this debt no every single</text>
  <text start="363.619" dur="5.52">country would fold and the central</text>
  <text start="366.74" dur="3.959">bankers know this and they can&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="369.139" dur="4.8">this to happen because they would be</text>
  <text start="370.699" dur="4.71">exposed now they never thought that they</text>
  <text start="373.939" dur="3.421">were going to have this problem where</text>
  <text start="375.409" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re completely exposed they thought</text>
  <text start="377.36" dur="3.059">they were going to be in this major</text>
  <text start="379.039" dur="5.73">major event which would cover up</text>
  <text start="380.419" dur="7.29">everything but that&amp;#39;s not happening the</text>
  <text start="384.769" dur="7.14">world is watching this is what it looks</text>
  <text start="387.709" dur="7.25">like when a central bank system a global</text>
  <text start="391.909" dur="6.24">central bank system implodes on itself</text>
  <text start="394.959" dur="6.1">now Trump he was giving a speech in</text>
  <text start="398.149" dur="6.72">Pennsylvania and he&amp;#39;s celebrating the</text>
  <text start="401.059" dur="7.681">energy boom and he&amp;#39;s bringing back jobs</text>
  <text start="404.869" dur="6.21">to this area he explained his</text>
  <text start="408.74" dur="5.129">determination to reduce regulations and</text>
  <text start="411.079" dur="5.43">speed up construction permitting came</text>
  <text start="413.869" dur="5.28">from his experience as a builder he said</text>

  <text start="466.34" dur="7.24">everything back to the United States</text>
  <text start="469.43" dur="6.25">taking us off the reliance of energy</text>
  <text start="473.58" dur="3.989">that has to do with the middle east</text>

  <text start="701.769" dur="8.551">at the global slowdown and you just go</text>
  <text start="705.67" dur="8.7">back to 2017 that&amp;#39;s when it began the</text>
  <text start="710.32" dur="7.44">trade war start was the third quarter of</text>
  <text start="714.37" dur="6.27">2018 the trade wars have nothing to do</text>
  <text start="717.76" dur="6.15">with the slow down because the slowdown</text>
  <text start="720.64" dur="7.68">was already happening and it would have</text>
  <text start="723.91" dur="7.44">continued no matter what Trump and the</text>
  <text start="728.32" dur="5.73">Patriots they already knew this they</text>
  <text start="731.35" dur="4.53">knew that this was going to implode they</text>
  <text start="734.05" dur="4.59">knew that the central bank system was</text>
  <text start="735.88" dur="7.139">not going to survive and the trade war</text>
  <text start="738.64" dur="6.3">has absolutely nothing to do with it it</text>
  <text start="743.019" dur="3.151">was falling apart way before this why do</text>
  <text start="744.94" dur="2.82">you think they started stimulus why do</text>
  <text start="746.17" dur="3.03">you think they went to zero percent</text>
  <text start="747.76" dur="4.319">interest rate why do you think Europe</text>
  <text start="749.2" dur="5.85">went to negative they were holding out</text>
  <text start="752.079" dur="7.32">and they were hoping they&amp;#39;d get somebody</text>
  <text start="755.05" dur="7.08">else in as president to help them create</text>
  <text start="759.399" dur="4.951">this event that would cover everything</text>
  <text start="762.13" dur="4.44">up they didn&amp;#39;t get this so they need</text>
  <text start="764.35" dur="5.82">something they need someone to blame and</text>
  <text start="766.57" dur="4.1">that&amp;#39;s Trump but we know what&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="770.17" dur="3.06">happen</text>
  <text start="770.67" dur="4.659">phase one of the trade deal with China</text>
  <text start="773.23" dur="4.859">is going to be sign then we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="775.329" dur="6.301">have another signature probably in 2020</text>
  <text start="778.089" dur="5.101">and the trade war will be all over what</text>
  <text start="781.63" dur="4.829">are they going to say then now even if</text>
  <text start="783.19" dur="5.91">the trade war isn&amp;#39;t over Trump has been</text>
  <text start="786.459" dur="5.88">setting up the Federal Reserve been</text>
  <text start="789.1" dur="8.099">setting up the central bank a plan and a</text>
  <text start="792.339" dur="8.791">back-up plan works both ways now the bad</text>
  <text start="797.199" dur="7.08">guys in the Fed they don&amp;#39;t want Trump to</text>
  <text start="801.13" dur="7.019">push them into stimulus they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="804.279" dur="4.861">another rate cut so we have fed evan</text>
  <text start="808.149" dur="3.511">saying that there&amp;#39;s going to be no more</text>
  <text start="809.14" dur="6.36">rate cuts we don&amp;#39;t need them through</text>
  <text start="811.66" dur="6.76">2020 they don&amp;#39;t want them we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="815.5" dur="4.78">them everything is great</text>
  <text start="818.42" dur="5.85">now think about why he&amp;#39;s saying this</text>
  <text start="820.28" dur="8.19">because once Trump gets what he wants</text>
  <text start="824.27" dur="7.26">and we hit a certain rate cut and we hit</text>
  <text start="828.47" dur="4.76">a certain level of stimulus the economy</text>
  <text start="831.53" dur="4.05">is going to take off they know this and</text>
  <text start="833.23" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop this before this</text>
  <text start="835.58" dur="3.42">happens because once this happens</text>
  <text start="837.52" dur="2.56">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna go</text>
  <text start="839" dur="2.94">what does everyone been talking about</text>
  <text start="840.08" dur="4.62">you said we&amp;#39;re gonna be heading into a</text>
  <text start="841.94" dur="4.74">recession but the stock market is over</text>
  <text start="844.7" dur="3.39">thirty thousand the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="846.68" dur="4.41">are really low the GDP numbers look</text>
  <text start="848.09" dur="5.58">fantastic and everyone seems pretty darn</text>
  <text start="851.09" dur="4.68">happy so what is the mainstream media</text>

  <text start="863.33" dur="2.73">this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense I like what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="865.31" dur="4.68">happening right now</text>
  <text start="866.06" dur="5.01">let&amp;#39;s reelect Trump now Trump he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="869.99" dur="2.82">what he does best</text>

  <text start="876.89" dur="5.19">once again he tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="878.93" dur="5.1">the Federal Reserve is derelict in its</text>
  <text start="882.08" dur="5.01">duties if it doesn&amp;#39;t lower the rate and</text>
  <text start="884.03" dur="4.59">even ideally stimulate take a look</text>

  <text start="892.34" dur="6.78">negative interest rates fed was way too</text>
  <text start="895.43" dur="7.59">fast to raise and way too slow to cut</text>
  <text start="899.12" dur="7.5">and he&amp;#39;s putting the pressure on the Fed</text>
  <text start="903.02" dur="6.78">if anything goes wrong Trump all he has</text>
  <text start="906.62" dur="6.95">to say is the Fed didn&amp;#39;t listen if they</text>
  <text start="909.8" dur="8.25">listened we&amp;#39;d be better off today</text>
  <text start="913.57" dur="7.93">Patriots are in control Trump is going</text>
