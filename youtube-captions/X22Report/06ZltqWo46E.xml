  <text start="140.95" dur="8.52">continually convincing us that Greece is</text>
  <text start="145" dur="7.23">on the path of recovery and we know</text>
  <text start="149.47" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;re not all they did was take a big</text>
  <text start="152.23" dur="7.74">piece of tape they put it on the crack</text>
  <text start="156.19" dur="6.54">and it&amp;#39;s not really sticking it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="4.68">falling off and the crack is getting</text>
  <text start="162.73" dur="5.839">deeper and deeper</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="7.32">and Greece is moving into an area where</text>
  <text start="168.569" dur="7.53">they&amp;#39;re just gonna completely implode on</text>
  <text start="171.97" dur="6.659">itself but the central bankers will</text>
  <text start="176.099" dur="4.39">completely take everything that Greece</text>
  <text start="178.629" dur="5.181">has before this happens and this is</text>
  <text start="180.489" dur="6.051">their plan but the people of Greece</text>
  <text start="183.81" dur="10.42">they&amp;#39;re not doing so well</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="12.16">now right now the Greek people might</text>
  <text start="194.23" dur="6.479">have their electric turned off because</text>
  <text start="198.7" dur="5.819">the amount of unpaid bills by its</text>
  <text start="200.709" dur="8.81">customers has reached around 2.5 billion</text>
  <text start="204.519" dur="7.741">euros and the public power company is</text>
  <text start="209.519" dur="5.381">angry about this and plans to cut the</text>
  <text start="212.26" dur="7.679">power to those without outstanding debts</text>
  <text start="214.9" dur="8.009">as soon as possible and that&amp;#39;s about 2.1</text>
  <text start="219.939" dur="7.44">million Greeks that are going to be put</text>
  <text start="222.909" dur="8.001">into darkness now many Greeks can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="227.379" dur="6.241">afford these bills they don&amp;#39;t have jobs</text>
  <text start="230.91" dur="4.96">their businesses are completely wiped</text>
  <text start="233.62" dur="7.739">out their wealth is completely wiped out</text>
  <text start="235.87" dur="7.229">and shutting off their electric is not</text>
  <text start="241.359" dur="3.181">going to force them to pay because most</text>
  <text start="243.099" dur="6.29">of these people just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="8.699">money and this is a lot of people and</text>
  <text start="249.389" dur="6.82">you know adding extra fees or turn off</text>
  <text start="253.239" dur="7.49">and turn on fees doesn&amp;#39;t make it better</text>
  <text start="256.209" dur="7.291">either and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="260.729" dur="5.651">horrific situation if this actually</text>
  <text start="263.5" dur="4.68">occurs I mean we saw here in the United</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="4.44">States with Detroit when they were going</text>
  <text start="268.18" dur="5.519">to shut the water system off shutting</text>
  <text start="270.82" dur="5.969">the electric most of these people are</text>
  <text start="273.699" dur="5.431">going to die and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="276.789" dur="4.831">watch that situation very carefully here</text>
  <text start="279.13" dur="3.96">in the United States the central bankers</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="3.6">are up to their old tricks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="4.199">trying to convince us that everything is</text>
  <text start="285.22" dur="5.58">fine here we&amp;#39;re in a complete recovery</text>
  <text start="287.289" dur="7.861">the US government is raising their hands</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="5.489">up saying everything is fine and we know</text>
  <text start="295.15" dur="3.09">they can manipulate a lot of these</text>
  <text start="296.289" dur="4.47">numbers to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="298.24" dur="4.769">but everything&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="300.759" dur="4.53">and separate from what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="303.009" dur="4.351">here because when we look at the initial</text>
  <text start="305.289" dur="5.88">jobless claims they are continually</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="5.58">declining and we know that there are</text>
  <text start="311.169" dur="5.011">more and more people being laid off</text>
  <text start="312.94" dur="5.849">I mean challenger gray they&amp;#39;re reporting</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="5.31">a massive spike in energy sector layoffs</text>
  <text start="318.789" dur="4.891">and they&amp;#39;re saying that these energy</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="6.179">sector layoffs are hitting six-month</text>
  <text start="323.68" dur="8.43">highs they&amp;#39;re nine times higher in 2015</text>
  <text start="327.669" dur="5.761">than they were in 2014 and Texas is the</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="5.73">leader with about a hundred and three</text>
  <text start="333.43" dur="6.239">thousand layoffs and at this point from</text>
  <text start="337.84" dur="4.71">the beginning of 2015 to this point</text>
  <text start="339.669" dur="4.62">there is five hundred and forty three</text>
  <text start="342.55" dur="4.709">thousand nine hundred and thirty five</text>
  <text start="344.289" dur="7.641">jobs that were laid off already this</text>
  <text start="347.259" dur="9.121">year thirty-one percent higher than in</text>
  <text start="351.93" dur="6.7">2014 and they&amp;#39;re continually trying to</text>
  <text start="356.38" dur="5.759">make us believe that initial jobless</text>
  <text start="358.63" dur="8.49">claims are declining well this month</text>
  <text start="362.139" dur="6.87">they surged around 16,000 well you know</text>
  <text start="367.12" dur="3.63">what they&amp;#39;re going to do they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="369.009" dur="3.991">have to revise that number and most</text>
  <text start="370.75" dur="4.289">likely we will see initial jobless</text>
  <text start="373" dur="4.62">claims fall once again because they have</text>
  <text start="375.039" dur="6.72">to manipulate everything to keep their</text>
  <text start="377.62" dur="8.579">side of the story and when you look at</text>
  <text start="381.759" dur="6.81">it we see layoffs increasing an initial</text>
  <text start="386.199" dur="6.541">jobless claims decreasing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.569" dur="7.051">heading in opposite directions and it</text>
  <text start="392.74" dur="5.25">really doesn&amp;#39;t make sense because you</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="6.51">know as soon as you&amp;#39;re laid off you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="397.99" dur="7.44">going to go and claim and you want the</text>
  <text start="402.13" dur="6.45">unemployment insurance and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="405.43" dur="5.039">believe all these people and more</text>
  <text start="408.58" dur="5.1">layoffs are being announced every day</text>
  <text start="410.469" dur="7.44">they&amp;#39;re not going to go ahead and make</text>
  <text start="413.68" dur="6.6">the claim of course they are now right</text>
  <text start="417.909" dur="4.461">now the American people they&amp;#39;re feeling</text>

  <text start="491.59" dur="5.43">well or not doing well well there is a</text>
  <text start="493.81" dur="6.75">more accurate way and that is the u.s.</text>

  <text start="510.79" dur="4.98">this is perhaps even more accurate</text>

  <text start="542.62" dur="5.76">percent in the first quarter but this</text>
  <text start="545.56" dur="5.85">was the weakest increase since the first</text>
