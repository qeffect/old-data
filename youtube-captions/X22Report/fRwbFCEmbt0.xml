  <text start="211.67" dur="5.38">everything is starting to fall apart I</text>
  <text start="214.94" dur="5.23">mean ninety two percent of the</text>
  <text start="217.05" dur="5.1">economist&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re predicting that we</text>
  <text start="220.17" dur="6.02">were going to have a Fed rate hike in</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="8.1">September well guess what they were all</text>
  <text start="226.19" dur="8.019">wrong and of course then they said</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="7.95">october then they said november and here</text>
  <text start="234.209" dur="5.941">we are in december now i see peter</text>
  <text start="238.2" dur="11.15">schiff is out there and he&amp;#39;s suggesting</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="14.43">that maybe the Fed might up the Fed rate</text>
  <text start="249.35" dur="8.59">the interest rate now when i see this</text>
  <text start="254.58" dur="6.719">this tells me that they are planning to</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="8.01">bring this economy down and I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="261.299" dur="6.691">this in my past reports when the Fed the</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="5.279">central bank system decides to raise</text>
  <text start="267.99" dur="5.25">interest rates this is the signal that</text>
  <text start="271.229" dur="5.761">the economy is getting ready to be</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="5.82">getting ready to be brought down by the</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="6.179">central bank because they want to do</text>
  <text start="279.06" dur="6.99">this before any type of an event and we</text>
  <text start="283.169" dur="6.571">can see that we are headed in this</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="5.25">direction and in the beginning they</text>
  <text start="289.74" dur="4.5">might bring it up only a couple basis</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="4.679">points everyone will say huh look the</text>
  <text start="294.24" dur="3.209">interest rate it moved up a little bit</text>
  <text start="295.979" dur="3.15">everything is fine</text>
  <text start="297.449" dur="4.65">of course what will happen a lot of</text>
  <text start="299.129" dur="6.481">people will be um pretty much bumped out</text>
  <text start="302.099" dur="4.65">of the real estate market because the</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="3">house that they thought that we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="306.749" dur="3.361">to be able to get they can no longer yet</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="5.01">because the interest rates have gone up</text>
  <text start="310.11" dur="4.5">a little bit they can&amp;#39;t afford it so</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="3.96">they either have to make it up with</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="4.979">putting down a larger down payment so</text>
  <text start="317.58" dur="3.809">that&amp;#39;s going to be a problem and Real</text>
  <text start="319.589" dur="4.021">Estate&amp;#39;s going to be affected but will</text>
  <text start="321.389" dur="4.62">it shatter the economy right away no it</text>
  <text start="323.61" dur="8.459">won&amp;#39;t it will put the economy on the</text>
  <text start="326.009" dur="8.88">track to collapse and this way they can</text>
  <text start="332.069" dur="5.011">plan everything out for the entire</text>
  <text start="334.889" dur="4.291">collapse and this is what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="5.579">at this point because the second time</text>
  <text start="339.18" dur="6.329">they raise the interest rates this will</text>
  <text start="342.659" dur="5.671">be the full fetch a collapse but they</text>
  <text start="345.509" dur="4.77">will not actually do it they will say</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="5.519">they&amp;#39;re going to do it and then we will</text>
  <text start="350.279" dur="6.03">see an event this is where we are headed</text>
  <text start="353.849" dur="4.861">right now the economic data is</text>
  <text start="356.309" dur="3.991">completely separate and apart from what</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="4.019">the government is producing in the</text>
  <text start="360.3" dur="4.889">manipulative statistical numbers those</text>
  <text start="362.729" dur="4.92">numbers don&amp;#39;t match what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="365.189" dur="4.47">on the economy they&amp;#39;re already having</text>
  <text start="367.649" dur="5.091">reports that this year the retail sales</text>
  <text start="369.659" dur="5.581">are going to be a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="372.74" dur="4.899">once we get past Black Friday and Cyber</text>
  <text start="375.24" dur="7.799">Monday this will give us a gauge on how</text>
  <text start="377.639" dur="7.14">it is going now Russian is a Russian</text>
  <text start="383.039" dur="5.55">President Putin is going to meet with</text>
  <text start="384.779" dur="7.741">Van of and Venezuela&amp;#39;s Maduro to discuss</text>
  <text start="388.589" dur="6.66">energy ties and the two leaders are</text>
  <text start="392.52" dur="6.09">discussing bilateral relations which</text>
  <text start="395.249" dur="6.75">includes the energy sector and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="8.22">looking to make some type of deal with</text>
  <text start="401.999" dur="8.94">oil trade and hopefully combine and join</text>
  <text start="406.83" dur="4.949">forces to control the oil market because</text>
  <text start="410.939" dur="2.79">you have to remember right now</text>
  <text start="411.779" dur="4.35">everything is flowing from the west to</text>
  <text start="413.729" dur="7.201">the east this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing now</text>
  <text start="416.129" dur="8.28">we talked about the Chinese you want</text>
  <text start="420.93" dur="5.31">remember becoming a reserve currency now</text>
  <text start="424.409" dur="3.99">i remember when i started to talk about</text>
  <text start="426.24" dur="3.63">this people are out there absolutely</text>
  <text start="428.399" dur="3.001">impossible it&amp;#39;s never going to become a</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="3.72">reserve currency</text>
  <text start="431.4" dur="6.69">and we know the United States kind of</text>
  <text start="433.59" dur="7.049">stopped china by instructing the IMF not</text>
  <text start="438.09" dur="6.299">to include it but it looks like the IMF</text>
  <text start="440.639" dur="6.03">is coming out and they are saying yes we</text>
  <text start="444.389" dur="7.65">will be including the Chinese you want</text>
  <text start="446.669" dur="8.191">to the SDR basket now at this point I</text>
  <text start="452.039" dur="6.421">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to matter that</text>
  <text start="454.86" dur="7.23">much because the economy in the Western</text>
  <text start="458.46" dur="6.81">world is falling apart and at this point</text>
  <text start="462.09" dur="5.85">the United States doesn&amp;#39;t really care if</text>
  <text start="465.27" dur="3.929">they become a reserve currency because</text>
  <text start="467.94" dur="2.64">what they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="469.199" dur="5.28">going to push it to the next level and</text>
  <text start="470.58" dur="5.76">that is create an event than a war so</text>
  <text start="474.479" dur="5.851">right now while this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="476.34" dur="7.71">going on in France it looks like the u1</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="6.36">is on par to become a reserve currency</text>
  <text start="484.05" dur="4.29">which will join it will join the u.s.</text>
  <text start="486.69" dur="5.159">dollar the Japanese yen the british</text>
  <text start="488.34" dur="7.38">pound the euro and this is scheduled for</text>
  <text start="491.849" dur="6.061">november 30th if the you wand edition</text>
  <text start="495.72" dur="4.919">wins seventy percent or more of the IMF</text>
  <text start="497.91" dur="4.08">board it will be the first time the</text>
  <text start="500.639" dur="3.511">number of currencies in the SDR basket</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="4.37">which determines the composition of</text>
  <text start="504.15" dur="6.57">loans made to countries such as greece</text>
  <text start="506.36" dur="6.369">has been expanded now what is the</text>
  <text start="510.72" dur="5.189">likelihood of this happening well china</text>
  <text start="512.729" dur="5.221">feels that it&amp;#39;s going to happen they</text>
  <text start="515.909" dur="8.041">said the only thing that will stop this</text>
  <text start="517.95" dur="10.02">is the u.s. if they decide to reject the</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="7.29">you want inclusion unless something</text>
  <text start="527.97" dur="7.53">dramatic happens during this time period</text>
  <text start="531.24" dur="7.23">that will stop the yuan being included</text>
  <text start="535.5" dur="4.98">in the basket of sdrs so this is</text>
  <text start="538.47" dur="5.13">something we need to look out for this</text>
  <text start="540.48" dur="9.2">is something that is headed at us right</text>
  <text start="543.6" dur="10.739">now because we know the dollar is dying</text>
  <text start="549.68" dur="6.88">we know at this point they can&amp;#39;t push</text>
  <text start="554.339" dur="5.271">the debt any further the Middle East is</text>
  <text start="556.56" dur="3.05">a complete mess</text>
  <text start="560.32" dur="6.21">and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="563.8" dur="4.71">economic data and the real economic</text>
  <text start="566.53" dur="5.28">indicators are separate and apart and</text>
  <text start="568.51" dur="6.42">this economy is collapsing they&amp;#39;ve tried</text>
  <text start="571.81" dur="5.07">everything they possibly could they</text>
  <text start="574.93" dur="4.17">tried to go all over the world to try to</text>
  <text start="576.88" dur="6.45">find money to bring in as revenue which</text>
  <text start="579.1" dur="6.9">is FATCA they tried Obamacare to tax the</text>
  <text start="583.33" dur="4.14">people as much as they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="586" dur="3.93">bring in the revenues of the government</text>
  <text start="587.47" dur="5.73">they kept interest rates at zero percent</text>
  <text start="589.93" dur="6.33">there even talks about going to negative</text>
  <text start="593.2" dur="6.96">interest rates they are running out of</text>
  <text start="596.26" dur="7.86">bullets they&amp;#39;re running out of things to</text>
  <text start="600.16" dur="5.04">do to keep this system alive and this is</text>
  <text start="604.12" dur="4.41">what&amp;#39;s happening right now I mean</text>
  <text start="605.2" dur="5.67">Obamacare right now is basically a</text>
  <text start="608.53" dur="5.07">hindrance on the people here in the</text>
  <text start="610.87" dur="5.88">United States it&amp;#39;s not affordable it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="6.75">one big gigantic tax on the American</text>
  <text start="616.75" dur="7.11">people and when we look at this week we</text>
  <text start="620.35" dur="6.6">see that the premiums are going up and</text>
  <text start="623.86" dur="4.2">the deductibles are going up and for</text>
  <text start="626.95" dur="3.6">those people who are not familiar with a</text>
  <text start="628.06" dur="4.73">deductible what it means is once you get</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="5.79">your insurance policy and you have a 35</text>
  <text start="632.79" dur="7.06">$10,000 deductible you have to meet that</text>
  <text start="636.34" dur="6.24">first throughout the year which means if</text>
  <text start="639.85" dur="6.21">you go to the doctor you pay out of</text>
  <text start="642.58" dur="7.68">pocket until you hit that deductible and</text>
  <text start="646.06" dur="7.08">if you don&amp;#39;t hit that deductible you pay</text>
  <text start="650.26" dur="6.18">for everything if you hit the deductible</text>
  <text start="653.14" dur="5.61">everything above that deductible might</text>
  <text start="656.44" dur="5.61">be covered by insurance depending on</text>
  <text start="658.75" dur="5.58">your plan and if you never hit that</text>
  <text start="662.05" dur="4.86">deductible or if you do hit the</text>
  <text start="664.33" dur="5.97">deductible the next year it starts all</text>
  <text start="666.91" dur="6.2">over and people are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="670.3" dur="5.12">this saying okay I pay for my policy and</text>
  <text start="673.11" dur="5.65">I&amp;#39;m paying five hundred dollars a month</text>
  <text start="675.42" dur="5.35">but the hidden cost is that I have to</text>
  <text start="678.76" dur="3.36">lay out another three another five in</text>
  <text start="680.77" dur="5.43">another ten thousand dollars if I go to</text>
  <text start="682.12" dur="7.35">the doctor and people are complaining</text>
  <text start="686.2" dur="6.78">about this and it&amp;#39;s not helping them I</text>
  <text start="689.47" dur="4.76">mean David or reigns who&amp;#39;s 60 years old</text>
  <text start="692.98" dur="4.17">who lives in New Jersey</text>
  <text start="694.23" dur="6.4">he&amp;#39;s a former hardware salesman with</text>
  <text start="697.15" dur="6.11">chronic knee pain he says we have</text>
  <text start="700.63" dur="4.8">insurance but we can&amp;#39;t afford to use it</text>
  <text start="703.26" dur="5.53">they have a three-thousand-dollar</text>
  <text start="705.43" dur="7.98">deductible everything comes out of his</text>
  <text start="708.79" dur="9.36">pocket so this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="713.41" dur="7.11">right now and it&amp;#39;s just not good for the</text>
  <text start="718.15" dur="3.81">American people and it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="720.52" dur="4.05">get any better premiums are going to</text>
  <text start="721.96" dur="4.38">continually rise deductibles are going</text>
  <text start="724.57" dur="4.47">to continually rise and I mentioned this</text>
  <text start="726.34" dur="6.6">before think about this for a second how</text>
  <text start="729.04" dur="5.34">did they do this Obama and his executive</text>
  <text start="732.94" dur="4.08">branch got together with the insurance</text>
  <text start="734.38" dur="5.96">companies who wrote the bill and said</text>
  <text start="737.02" dur="8.73">listen we can give everyone the same</text>
  <text start="740.34" dur="8.14">insurance and all we have to do is raise</text>
  <text start="745.75" dur="4.89">the prices the premiums up to a certain</text>
  <text start="748.48" dur="4.92">point and then we can accept everyone</text>
  <text start="750.64" dur="4.83">and hopefully the younger people will</text>
