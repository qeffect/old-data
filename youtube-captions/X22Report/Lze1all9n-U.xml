  <text start="110.45" dur="4.11">little bit longer than that and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="112.28" dur="4.649">noticed that things are actually getting</text>
  <text start="114.56" dur="6.15">worse and worse for this company</text>
  <text start="116.929" dur="6.271">and as of today the company is now in</text>
  <text start="120.71" dur="5.22">the mortgage selling business that you</text>
  <text start="123.2" dur="4.32">should a press release and the company</text>
  <text start="125.93" dur="3.57">announced it has entered into an</text>
  <text start="127.52" dur="6.029">arrangement with an undisclosed third</text>
  <text start="129.5" dur="6.84">party to sell up to a total of 1.5</text>
  <text start="133.549" dur="5.341">billion in funded mortgages and loan</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="6.66">renewals now this is in a desperate</text>
  <text start="138.89" dur="6.24">attempt to shore up their liquidity so</text>
  <text start="143" dur="4.86">what are they doing here well home</text>
  <text start="145.13" dur="5.31">capital they added that the deal that</text>
  <text start="147.86" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;ve made includes up to 1 billion of</text>
  <text start="150.44" dur="5.4">uninsured mortgages and 500 million of</text>
  <text start="153.29" dur="4.949">insured mortgages or about 10 percent of</text>
  <text start="155.84" dur="5.28">the company&amp;#39;s total mortgage book well</text>
  <text start="158.239" dur="4.681">it didn&amp;#39;t really provide the most</text>
  <text start="161.12" dur="5.25">important information about all of this</text>
  <text start="162.92" dur="6.75">at what price are the mortgages being</text>
  <text start="166.37" dur="5.31">sold at and when we look at what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.67" dur="6.3">doing right now we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="7.5">becoming very desperate why because when</text>
  <text start="175.97" dur="7.56">we look at the deposits well they are</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="6.239">continually dwindling now remember when</text>
  <text start="183.53" dur="3.24">they first started out five weeks ago</text>
  <text start="185.419" dur="5.191">they had about two</text>
  <text start="186.77" dur="7.32">billion in deposits as of today May 9th</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="6.12">they are now down to a hundred and forty</text>
  <text start="194.09" dur="4.65">six million just yesterday they were at</text>
  <text start="196.73" dur="5.46">a hundred what ninety two million or so</text>
  <text start="198.74" dur="6.39">so we can see right now they are in big</text>
  <text start="202.19" dur="4.65">big trouble and people are waking up</text>
  <text start="205.13" dur="4.41">saying you know something I am running</text>
  <text start="206.84" dur="5.4">to this mortgage lender and I&amp;#39;m getting</text>
  <text start="209.54" dur="3.99">as much as I possibly can out of the</text>
  <text start="212.24" dur="4.17">company before the whole thing just</text>
  <text start="213.53" dur="5.79">implodes on itself and this is a perfect</text>
  <text start="216.41" dur="4.68">example of what will happen when there</text>
  <text start="219.32" dur="4.23">are bank runs people are going to run</text>
  <text start="221.09" dur="6.21">now think about this if there are</text>
  <text start="223.55" dur="6.9">multiple mortgage lenders banks that</text>
  <text start="227.3" dur="6.33">have this problem and everyone is</text>
  <text start="230.45" dur="4.41">running to the banking system to get</text>
  <text start="233.63" dur="3.45">their funds out because they see</text>
  <text start="234.86" dur="4.11">something is happening what do you think</text>
  <text start="237.08" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re going to do they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="238.97" dur="6.72">shut it down and I am really surprised</text>
  <text start="242.03" dur="5.64">they haven&amp;#39;t done this as of yet but we</text>
  <text start="245.69" dur="4.86">might see there might be a certain point</text>
  <text start="247.67" dur="5.55">where they say okay we hit 125 million</text>
  <text start="250.55" dur="4.409">now it&amp;#39;s time to shut it down I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="253.22" dur="3.42">know why they waited so long but we</text>
  <text start="254.959" dur="3.631">could see they&amp;#39;re going to do it when</text>
  <text start="256.64" dur="4.74">they reach a certain point now we</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="4.71">understand that people are hurting today</text>
  <text start="261.38" dur="3.81">in the economy a lot of people losing</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="3.9">their jobs a lot of retail stores</text>
  <text start="265.19" dur="6.18">closing a lot of corporations laying off</text>
  <text start="267.2" dur="6.12">and people are living day to day with a</text>
  <text start="271.37" dur="3.63">certain amount of money sometimes they</text>
  <text start="273.32" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t make it the full month sometimes</text>
  <text start="275" dur="4.53">they don&amp;#39;t have enough money to pay for</text>
  <text start="277.67" dur="3.69">food electric and things like that</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="3.48">and especially when there&amp;#39;s an emergency</text>
  <text start="281.36" dur="3.78">that comes up they just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="283.01" dur="4.68">funds to pay for this and remember a</text>
  <text start="285.14" dur="5.16">couple reports back we reported on how</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="4.83">Americans can&amp;#39;t afford to write a $500</text>
  <text start="290.3" dur="4.29">check if there&amp;#39;s some type of an</text>
  <text start="292.52" dur="4.47">emergency and it&amp;#39;s not just here in the</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="6.29">United States there was another survey</text>
  <text start="296.99" dur="8.06">that was done and half of Canadians have</text>
  <text start="300.88" dur="8.32">$200 or less in savings and they are</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="7.03">living on a certain amount of funds they</text>
  <text start="309.2" dur="5.07">have just enough to get by each month</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="5.339">and if there is some type of an</text>
  <text start="314.27" dur="4.47">emergency they don&amp;#39;t have extra funds to</text>
  <text start="317.419" dur="2.881">pay for anything and it&amp;#39;s not just the</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="2.94">United States and Canada</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="4.14">this is actually happening throughout</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="6.06">the entire world where the private</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="6.06">western central bank system has put all</text>
  <text start="327.74" dur="4.56">these countries into so much debt where</text>
  <text start="330.5" dur="4.259">there&amp;#39;s so much hot with it with the</text>
  <text start="332.3" dur="5.91">unemployment is so high we could see</text>
  <text start="334.759" dur="6.72">that things are very very difficult for</text>
  <text start="338.21" dur="5.669">everyone and it&amp;#39;s getting worse and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.479" dur="4.5">not getting better and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="343.879" dur="5.54">right now is that people are finding it</text>
  <text start="345.979" dur="6.99">very difficult to actually just make it</text>
  <text start="349.419" dur="6.611">month-to-month because most of the time</text>
  <text start="352.969" dur="4.681">their funds run out either in the middle</text>
  <text start="356.03" dur="4.56">or right at the end of the month and</text>
  <text start="357.65" dur="6.509">they need that next check too</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="5.579">just to get by and what happens is as we</text>
  <text start="364.159" dur="4.56">go as these people go from one month to</text>
  <text start="366.169" dur="3.96">the next month it doesn&amp;#39;t improve it</text>
  <text start="368.719" dur="3.271">actually gets worse because it gets</text>
  <text start="370.129" dur="4.41">harder and harder and this is why we see</text>
  <text start="371.99" dur="4.44">people taking two three four part-time</text>
  <text start="374.539" dur="3.961">jobs and this is why when we look at the</text>
  <text start="376.43" dur="4.949">unemployment numbers we realize that</text>
  <text start="378.5" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s no way that this 4.4 percent</text>
  <text start="381.379" dur="4.891">unemployment can be absolutely true</text>
  <text start="383.3" dur="4.44">because most of the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="3.179">are completely manipulated and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="387.74" dur="4.44">counting all these multiple part-time</text>
  <text start="389.449" dur="3.931">jobs as full-time jobs and this is where</text>
  <text start="392.18" dur="3.359">they&amp;#39;re actually getting the number but</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="4.259">when we look at wages and we look at</text>
  <text start="395.539" dur="5.521">what&amp;#39;s really going on we can see that</text>
  <text start="397.639" dur="7.08">what they&amp;#39;re trying to spoon-feed us it</text>
  <text start="401.06" dur="5.52">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense and we have proof</text>
  <text start="404.719" dur="3.781">of this because we can see that</text>
  <text start="406.58" dur="4.11">everything is accelerating to the</text>
  <text start="408.5" dur="4.74">downside forget about the stock market</text>
  <text start="410.69" dur="4.83">we know the banks we know the central</text>
  <text start="413.24" dur="4.679">bank we know central banks around the</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="4.829">world they&amp;#39;ve been buying as many stocks</text>
  <text start="417.919" dur="4.71">as they possibly can to prop up the</text>
  <text start="420.349" dur="4.41">entire system when we look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="422.629" dur="4.621">really going on here in the United</text>
  <text start="424.759" dur="4.5">States or Canada we can see that retail</text>
  <text start="427.25" dur="4.02">is contracting manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="429.259" dur="5.13">contracting industrial productions</text>
  <text start="431.27" dur="6.959">contracting wages are falling this is</text>
  <text start="434.389" dur="6.33">all happening because people are losing</text>
  <text start="438.229" dur="4.44">jobs and they&amp;#39;re not getting the high</text>
  <text start="440.719" dur="4.17">paying job they&amp;#39;re going out and finding</text>
  <text start="442.669" dur="4.321">part-time jobs if they can and if they</text>
  <text start="444.889" dur="3.931">can&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re just not working and</text>
  <text start="446.99" dur="3.539">they&amp;#39;re that&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s more and more</text>
  <text start="448.82" dur="3.029">people on food stamps this is why more</text>
  <text start="450.529" dur="2.331">and more people aren&amp;#39;t welfare this is</text>
  <text start="451.849" dur="3.53">why we</text>
  <text start="452.86" dur="5.459">see all of this happening today and when</text>
  <text start="455.379" dur="4.861">we look at Gallup and their report it</text>
  <text start="458.319" dur="4.831">shows that confidence right now is</text>
  <text start="460.24" dur="5.639">slumping and when people look at the</text>
  <text start="463.15" dur="5.16">economy they say well it doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="465.879" dur="4.88">like being the economy is improving at</text>
  <text start="468.31" dur="5.94">all it&amp;#39;s actually getting worse and</text>
  <text start="470.759" dur="5.47">according to Gallup this number</text>
  <text start="474.25" dur="3.21">continually rises where people are</text>
  <text start="476.229" dur="3.9">saying that the economy is getting worse</text>
  <text start="477.46" dur="4.44">right now forty-nine percent say that no</text>
  <text start="480.129" dur="4.741">the economy is not getting better it is</text>
  <text start="481.9" dur="6.66">getting worse and this is up from 45%</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="5.28">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that people are</text>
  <text start="488.56" dur="2.759">starting to realize now that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.15" dur="3.12">something wrong especially those</text>
  <text start="491.319" dur="4.681">individuals that are losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="493.27" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re saying okay I lost my job I</text>
  <text start="496" dur="2.969">can&amp;#39;t find another job</text>
  <text start="497.05" dur="3.69">what is going on here you&amp;#39;re telling me</text>
  <text start="498.969" dur="4.2">that we&amp;#39;re in full employment at four</text>
  <text start="500.74" dur="5.1">point four percent but I cannot find</text>
  <text start="503.169" dur="4.8">work or if I do find work</text>
  <text start="505.84" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s either part-time jobs or my salary</text>
  <text start="507.969" dur="6.06">is much much lower something is wrong</text>
  <text start="510.31" dur="6.899">here now we see wholesale sales well</text>
  <text start="514.029" dur="5.161">growth has stalled now in March and when</text>
  <text start="517.209" dur="2.931">we look at this it is the weakest in</text>
  <text start="519.19" dur="5.61">eight months</text>
  <text start="520.14" dur="6.939">lumber sales they have plummeted by 3%</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="4.56">they are down now every time they tell</text>
  <text start="527.079" dur="3.87">us that new construction is up and</text>
  <text start="529.36" dur="3.659">things are getting better and houses are</text>
  <text start="530.949" dur="5.541">being built and how could this be true</text>
  <text start="533.019" dur="6.75">because lumber is continually declining</text>
  <text start="536.49" dur="6.07">so something is wrong with what they are</text>
  <text start="539.769" dur="5.01">saying and we see already that the</text>
  <text start="542.56" dur="3.719">Atlanta Fed they have already dropped</text>
  <text start="544.779" dur="4.021">their estimate from four point two</text>
  <text start="546.279" dur="5.49">percent of GDP now it is down to three</text>
  <text start="548.8" dur="5.43">point six percent GDP and we will see</text>
  <text start="551.769" dur="5.671">this all throughout this quarter until</text>
  <text start="554.23" dur="5.19">they end up most likely below 1% once</text>
  <text start="557.44" dur="4.85">again unless they come in and they</text>
  <text start="559.42" dur="6.93">massively manipulate this number by</text>
  <text start="562.29" dur="5.59">pushing soybeans out there or something</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="4.5">else and this is what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="567.88" dur="5.19">before now very interestingly the Fed is</text>
  <text start="570.85" dur="4.83">reporting that there&amp;#39;s been an</text>
  <text start="573.07" dur="6.36">unexpected collapse in credit card and</text>
  <text start="575.68" dur="5.279">auto loan demand really unexpected maybe</text>
  <text start="579.43" dur="2.779">the people just don&amp;#39;t have the funds</text>
  <text start="580.959" dur="4.281">right down</text>
  <text start="582.209" dur="5.82">and what&amp;#39;s happening here is the Fed is</text>
  <text start="585.24" dur="5.25">not even believing their own data they</text>
  <text start="588.029" dur="4.891">don&amp;#39;t believe their own survey on the</text>
  <text start="590.49" dur="4.529">spending growth projections and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="592.92" dur="4.169">saying that no the spending growth it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="595.019" dur="3.75">fine this is just another anomaly and</text>
  <text start="597.089" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s something that we don&amp;#39;t have to be</text>
  <text start="598.769" dur="7.38">concerned about but the problem is is</text>
  <text start="601.769" dur="7.25">that consumers they are tapped out most</text>
  <text start="606.149" dur="5.1">of the credit cards are at the limit and</text>
  <text start="609.019" dur="4.42">people are saying listen I can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="611.249" dur="5.161">afford the payments now on the credit</text>
  <text start="613.439" dur="5.7">cards and if I add more it just will</text>
  <text start="616.41" dur="5.219">make things worse and plus the limits</text>
  <text start="619.139" dur="4.32">are at the top right now and people are</text>
  <text start="621.629" dur="3.721">slowing down their spending now think</text>
  <text start="623.459" dur="3.961">about this we talked about how</text>
  <text start="625.35" dur="5.07">everything is contracting in the economy</text>
  <text start="627.42" dur="6.12">and seventy percent of the GDP is made</text>
  <text start="630.42" dur="5.609">up of consumer spending the economy runs</text>
  <text start="633.54" dur="4.649">on the consumer and if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="636.029" dur="4.771">spending if they&amp;#39;re not putting more and</text>
  <text start="638.189" dur="5.031">more of their expenditures on their</text>
  <text start="640.8" dur="4.62">credit cards spending continually</text>
  <text start="643.22" dur="3.76">decreases and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="645.42" dur="3.959">seeing and this is why we see retail</text>
  <text start="646.98" dur="4.769">contracting because when you lose your</text>
  <text start="649.379" dur="4.531">job you don&amp;#39;t have the extra money and</text>
  <text start="651.749" dur="4.71">this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing now</text>
  <text start="653.91" dur="5.399">remember the stock market right now is</text>
  <text start="656.459" dur="5.07">being propped up by central banks around</text>
  <text start="659.309" dur="4.26">the world and we understand this because</text>
  <text start="661.529" dur="4.29">we discussed how the central banks are</text>
  <text start="663.569" dur="5.88">pumping in 200 to 250 billion every</text>
  <text start="665.819" dur="5.851">quarter into the stock market and we</text>
  <text start="669.449" dur="5.1">know that Switzerland came out and they</text>
  <text start="671.67" dur="5.82">admitted that they have purchased Apple</text>
  <text start="674.549" dur="5.611">stock and we can see right now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="677.49" dur="5.279">purchased billions and billions of the</text>
  <text start="680.16" dur="4.349">stock and we have to remember what makes</text>
  <text start="682.769" dur="4.951">up the sp500</text>
  <text start="684.509" dur="5.55">they are made up of a handful of tech</text>
  <text start="687.72" dur="5.25">companies Apple Amazon Microsoft and</text>
  <text start="690.059" dur="4.65">alphabet and these are the single most</text>
  <text start="692.97" dur="3.69">popular companies on the planet with</text>
  <text start="694.709" dur="5.16">every fund manager and even a Swiss</text>
  <text start="696.66" dur="4.979">National Bank loading up on them now if</text>
  <text start="699.869" dur="4.5">we remove these companies from the</text>
  <text start="701.639" dur="4.89">market the markets are down right now</text>
  <text start="704.369" dur="3.93">why does this matter because the</text>
  <text start="706.529" dur="4.05">fundamentals for these companies are</text>
  <text start="708.299" dur="4.98">rolling over and the investment crowd</text>
  <text start="710.579" dur="5.001">will soon be running to the exits take</text>
  <text start="713.279" dur="5.361">Apple sales for apples number one</text>
  <text start="715.58" dur="6">the iPhone well it began to decline a</text>
  <text start="718.64" dur="4.65">year ago they declined in three of the</text>
  <text start="721.58" dur="4.23">last four quarters on a year-over-year</text>
  <text start="723.29" dur="5.01">basis now throughout the same time</text>
  <text start="725.81" dur="6.269">period the company&amp;#39;s stock price has</text>
  <text start="728.3" dur="6.63">risen an astounding 75 percent so Apple</text>
  <text start="732.079" dur="5.491">stock has risen by 75 percent during the</text>
  <text start="734.93" dur="5.37">time the number one product is selling</text>
  <text start="737.57" dur="5.759">less and it&amp;#39;s trailing 12-month revenues</text>
  <text start="740.3" dur="5.13">are below its 2015 results so why does</text>
  <text start="743.329" dur="5.7">the stocks keep going up because the</text>
  <text start="745.43" dur="8.099">central banks are pumping this up that</text>
  <text start="749.029" dur="7.771">is why now the IMF in their notes they</text>
  <text start="753.529" dur="5.911">admitted something very interesting that</text>
  <text start="756.8" dur="5.279">corporate credit fundamentals have</text>
  <text start="759.44" dur="5.76">started to weaken creating conditions</text>
  <text start="762.079" dur="6.541">that have historically preceded a credit</text>
  <text start="765.2" dur="5.819">cycle downturn now we&amp;#39;re hearing a lot</text>
  <text start="768.62" dur="4.08">about this and we need to go back to</text>
  <text start="771.019" dur="3.781">what Bill halter said during one of the</text>
  <text start="772.7" dur="4.47">interviews that I had with him that the</text>
  <text start="774.8" dur="4.74">credit market is going to freeze up and</text>
  <text start="777.17" dur="4.5">once that freezes up there will be no</text>
  <text start="779.54" dur="5.13">deliveries to stores things are going to</text>
  <text start="781.67" dur="5.97">completely break down now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="784.67" dur="6.359">seeing right now is that the IMF in</text>
  <text start="787.64" dur="6.62">their notes they&amp;#39;re actually admitting</text>
  <text start="791.029" dur="6.661">to this and what they&amp;#39;re saying is that</text>
  <text start="794.26" dur="6.13">another concern according to the IMF is</text>
  <text start="797.69" dur="4.32">that the average interest coverage ratio</text>
  <text start="800.39" dur="3.33">which measures the ability for</text>
  <text start="802.01" dur="5.43">corporations current earnings to cover</text>
  <text start="803.72" dur="6.239">its interest expenses has shown a sharp</text>
  <text start="807.44" dur="4.35">drop over the past two years the</text>
  <text start="809.959" dur="3.481">researchers write that earnings have</text>
  <text start="811.79" dur="3.51">dropped to less than six times</text>
  <text start="813.44" dur="4.68">interest expense close to the weakest</text>
  <text start="815.3" dur="4.86">multiple since the onset of the global</text>
  <text start="818.12" dur="4.74">financial crisis now this is where it</text>
  <text start="820.16" dur="5.669">gets interesting the report notes</text>
  <text start="822.86" dur="5.57">further that historically deterioration</text>
  <text start="825.829" dur="5.671">of the interest coverage ratio</text>
  <text start="828.43" dur="6.49">corresponds with eventual widening and</text>
  <text start="831.5" dur="5.99">credit spreads for risky corporate debt</text>
  <text start="834.92" dur="4.529">so the credit market is freezing up</text>
  <text start="837.49" dur="5.62">corporations are going to be in trouble</text>
  <text start="839.449" dur="5.821">and then we have JPMorgan Chase out</text>
  <text start="843.11" dur="6.31">there and they just said something very</text>
  <text start="845.27" dur="6.49">interesting today JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="849.42" dur="6.72">is offering regional banks some</text>
  <text start="851.76" dur="8.49">interesting advice partner up as US</text>
  <text start="856.14" dur="8.64">deposit drain looms wait what do they</text>
  <text start="860.25" dur="7.98">just say partner up as US deposit drain</text>
  <text start="864.78" dur="6.57">looms the company&amp;#39;s investment bankers</text>
  <text start="868.23" dur="6.15">are warning depository clients that they</text>
  <text start="871.35" dur="6.15">may begin feeling the crunch in December</text>
  <text start="874.38" dur="5.25">thanks to a byproduct of how the US</text>
  <text start="877.5" dur="5.07">Federal Reserve propped up the economy</text>
  <text start="879.63" dur="4.8">after the financial crisis now this is</text>
  <text start="882.57" dur="4.44">according to a copy of confidential</text>
  <text start="884.43" dur="5.99">presentation obtained by Bloomberg News</text>
  <text start="887.01" dur="6.99">and confirmed by JPMorgan spokesman</text>
  <text start="890.42" dur="5.5">JPMorgan argues that some midsize US</text>
  <text start="894" dur="5.13">banks those with fifty billion in assets</text>
  <text start="895.92" dur="5.4">or less could face a funding problem in</text>
  <text start="899.13" dur="4.67">coming years as the Fed goes about</text>
  <text start="901.32" dur="5.25">shrinking its massive balance sheet now</text>
  <text start="903.8" dur="5.47">what I think they&amp;#39;re really doing right</text>
  <text start="906.57" dur="5.85">now they realize that the system is</text>
  <text start="909.27" dur="5.46">coming down and what they want to do is</text>
  <text start="912.42" dur="5.67">they want to consolidate all the</text>
  <text start="914.73" dur="5.64">deposits why it&amp;#39;s not to help the people</text>
  <text start="918.09" dur="4.14">believe me it&amp;#39;s not to help the small</text>
  <text start="920.37" dur="4.5">banks either they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="922.23" dur="4.68">completely wiped out what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.87" dur="5.07">planning to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="926.91" dur="6.06">consolidate the deposits so they are</text>
  <text start="929.94" dur="5.94">protected when the financial crisis hits</text>
  <text start="932.97" dur="5.04">and they are saying that they believe</text>
  <text start="935.88" dur="3.45">that this is going to come at the latter</text>
  <text start="938.01" dur="3.69">part of this year they&amp;#39;re not saying</text>
  <text start="939.33" dur="5.07">wait till December they&amp;#39;re saying do it</text>
  <text start="941.7" dur="6.12">now and they&amp;#39;re talking about smaller</text>
  <text start="944.4" dur="6.81">banks because what they will need is</text>
  <text start="947.82" dur="6.72">more deposits because they&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="951.21" dur="5.64">to use the balance to keep the banks</text>
  <text start="954.54" dur="6.84">afloat so they want all the smaller</text>
  <text start="956.85" dur="7.8">banks to basically partner up with the</text>
  <text start="961.38" dur="7.53">bigger banks to make sure everyone is</text>
  <text start="964.65" dur="7.32">protected so to me and to what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="968.91" dur="7.08">saying here is they&amp;#39;re broadcasting that</text>
  <text start="971.97" dur="8.28">you better do this now before it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="975.99" dur="5.76">late and JPMorgan Chase does nothing for</text>
  <text start="980.25" dur="3.06">the people they&amp;#39;re doing it for</text>
  <text start="981.75" dur="4.23">themselves they&amp;#39;re doing nothing</text>
  <text start="983.31" dur="4.589">or the smaller banks doing it for</text>
  <text start="985.98" dur="3.899">themselves and what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="987.899" dur="5.221">they&amp;#39;re preparing and getting ready for</text>
  <text start="989.879" dur="6.45">this major economic downturn and they&amp;#39;re</text>
