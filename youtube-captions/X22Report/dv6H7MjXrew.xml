  <text start="390.56" dur="5.7">be more commercial real estate on the</text>
  <text start="392.69" dur="7.11">market and it does not look good going</text>
  <text start="396.26" dur="6.96">forward whatsoever now the fourth</text>

  <text start="412.43" dur="7.2">while revenues are expected to fall by</text>
  <text start="415.31" dur="8.07">about 3.1 percent this is representing</text>
  <text start="419.63" dur="7.65">the worst US earning season since 2009</text>

  <text start="427.28" dur="3.59">profit growth</text>
  <text start="431.09" dur="7.14">and we see from everything that&amp;#39;s going</text>

  <text start="450.46" dur="6.85">mean it is just getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="5.97">as time goes on now I see all over the</text>
  <text start="457.31" dur="6.359">hall over the net everyone is picking up</text>
  <text start="460.4" dur="5.67">on what Obama said where he said that if</text>
  <text start="463.669" dur="3.691">you do not believe me if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="466.07" dur="3.72">believe the economy is doing better</text>
  <text start="467.36" dur="5.6">you&amp;#39;re a fool or you&amp;#39;re peddling fiction</text>
  <text start="469.79" dur="5.49">and I see gerald Celente out there</text>
  <text start="472.96" dur="4.29">screaming and yelling about it I see</text>
  <text start="475.28" dur="5.91">other screaming and yelling about it and</text>
  <text start="477.25" dur="5.979">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking the economy for</text>
  <text start="481.19" dur="3.87">quite a while we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on</text>
  <text start="483.229" dur="4.051">things and again every time we hear</text>
  <text start="485.06" dur="3.62">things from Case Shiller or from the</text>
  <text start="487.28" dur="3.419">national association of realtors</text>
  <text start="488.68" dur="4.39">remember they&amp;#39;re reporting things two</text>
  <text start="490.699" dur="3.991">three months behind we&amp;#39;re reporting</text>
  <text start="493.07" dur="3.9">things that are happening right now what</text>
  <text start="494.69" dur="3.84">we see right now and what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="496.97" dur="3.39">right now so it takes a little time for</text>
  <text start="498.53" dur="5.54">these people to catch up to what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="5.73">doing here and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="504.07" dur="4.99">everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="506.09" dur="5.37">is going to accelerate this is not going</text>
  <text start="509.06" dur="3.84">to slow down reverse itself the</text>
  <text start="511.46" dur="4.11">economy&amp;#39;s all of a sudden going to do</text>
  <text start="512.9" dur="4.41">better but Obama is out there trying to</text>
  <text start="515.57" dur="4.529">convince everyone and again if the</text>
  <text start="517.31" dur="5.34">economy was doing well you don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="520.099" dur="5.671">convince everyone because when the</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="6.21">economy is doing well people get jobs</text>
  <text start="525.77" dur="6.15">the jobs are well-paying jobs you feel</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="4.8">secure in your jobs and you take that</text>
  <text start="531.92" dur="5.49">money that you&amp;#39;re making and you go out</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="7.38">and you spend it in retail and retail</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="5.61">them will expand if retail expands what</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="4.919">happens well the manufacturers the</text>
  <text start="543.02" dur="4.98">factories they will produce more because</text>
  <text start="545.959" dur="3.361">people are demanding it if the</text>
  <text start="548" dur="3.029">manufacturers the factories are</text>
  <text start="549.32" dur="4.92">producing more guess what they off to</text>
  <text start="551.029" dur="5.131">order more raw material that means the</text>
  <text start="554.24" dur="6.15">Baltic Dry Index will increase so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="556.16" dur="6.09">not seeing this at all and we know that</text>
  <text start="560.39" dur="4.39">the government completely manipulates a</text>
  <text start="562.25" dur="4.93">lot of these numbers</text>
  <text start="564.78" dur="4.35">and he was out there citing that you</text>
  <text start="567.18" dur="5.28">know that 14 million jobs were created</text>
  <text start="569.13" dur="6.42">since he took office and of course he</text>
  <text start="572.46" dur="6.09">failed to mention that that he spent</text>
  <text start="575.55" dur="5.73">about a trillion dollars worth of these</text>
  <text start="578.55" dur="6.99">funds which is a seventy-seven percent</text>
  <text start="581.28" dur="8.37">increase and this was throughout the</text>
  <text start="585.54" dur="5.96">seven years and if you really take the</text>
  <text start="589.65" dur="4.5">calculation of how much was spent and</text>
  <text start="591.5" dur="4.57">you used basic math and I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="594.15" dur="7.74">about the Common Core math I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="596.07" dur="8.67">about real math you see that it took six</text>
  <text start="601.89" dur="9">hundred thousand dollars in government</text>
  <text start="604.74" dur="9.63">debt for every single job created think</text>
  <text start="610.89" dur="8.31">about that for a second six hundred</text>
  <text start="614.37" dur="7.59">thousand dollars to create every single</text>
  <text start="619.2" dur="4.23">job now of course all these jobs they</text>
  <text start="621.96" dur="3.84">create a lot of them are government jobs</text>
  <text start="623.43" dur="6.09">and a lot of the jobs he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="625.8" dur="7.35">our part-time jobs the high-paying good</text>
  <text start="629.52" dur="5.16">jobs are no longer to be found and more</text>
  <text start="633.15" dur="3.3">and more companies are laying off and we</text>
  <text start="634.68" dur="4.82">have to remember those people that have</text>
  <text start="636.45" dur="8.16">fallen off and are not counted anymore</text>
  <text start="639.5" dur="7.45">94 plus million people now the president</text>
  <text start="644.61" dur="5.52">is saying that everyone else is making</text>
  <text start="646.95" dur="4.83">it up that were all fools but the</text>
  <text start="650.13" dur="3.99">government&amp;#39;s own numbers show that they</text>
  <text start="651.78" dur="4.38">are completely in solvent to the tune of</text>
  <text start="654.12" dur="4.17">18 trillion and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="656.16" dur="3.33">telling us many of the calculations are</text>
  <text start="658.29" dur="3.42">saying it&amp;#39;s around two hundred or so</text>
  <text start="659.49" dur="3.75">trillion the annual reports for the</text>
  <text start="661.71" dur="2.76">Social Security trust fund show that</text>
  <text start="663.24" dur="3.57">they are rapidly running out of money</text>
  <text start="664.47" dur="5.85">the Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s own balance sheet</text>
  <text start="666.81" dur="5.37">shows that it is undercapitalized with a</text>
