  <text start="68.119" dur="5.43">hit back to regain the narrative let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.45" dur="4.199">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.549" dur="3.96">news now over the many couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="75.649" dur="4.86">we know that Trump has been building the</text>
  <text start="77.509" dur="5.22">narrative pushing the idea that the</text>
  <text start="80.509" dur="4.771">central bank the Fed is going to be</text>
  <text start="82.729" dur="5.611">responsible for this economic disaster</text>
  <text start="85.28" dur="5.759">and it&amp;#39;s just not an idea it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="88.34" dur="5.79">what&amp;#39;s going to happen and the Biz the</text>
  <text start="91.039" dur="5.311">IMF they&amp;#39;ve been fighting back they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="4.89">trying to create a narrative to shape</text>
  <text start="96.35" dur="4.26">something so they created documents and</text>
  <text start="99.02" dur="4.139">they&amp;#39;re going back in time and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="100.61" dur="5.22">trying to show that when you raise the</text>
  <text start="103.159" dur="6.181">interest rates it doesn&amp;#39;t collapse the</text>
  <text start="105.83" dur="5.13">economy it&amp;#39;s actually what the economic</text>
  <text start="109.34" dur="3.6">policies are and we&amp;#39;ll get into that in</text>
  <text start="110.96" dur="5.969">just a minute but I wanted to talk about</text>
  <text start="112.94" dur="6.09">how the entire economic system is</text>
  <text start="116.929" dur="4.591">deteriorating and it&amp;#39;s accelerating and</text>
  <text start="119.03" dur="4.649">it&amp;#39;s moving very very fast and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="121.52" dur="4.17">starting to see things really fall apart</text>
  <text start="123.679" dur="3.991">right now yes you might not see it on</text>
  <text start="125.69" dur="3.78">the corporate media but if you start to</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="3.33">look at this information and you start</text>
  <text start="129.47" dur="4.71">to see what is happening you go back in</text>
  <text start="131" dur="6.989">time you can see how the economy is</text>
  <text start="134.18" dur="5.55">barely staying afloat right now yes they</text>
  <text start="137.989" dur="3.871">can manipulate the statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="139.73" dur="4.649">up to a certain point I mean you can</text>
  <text start="141.86" dur="4.92">show the stock market is continually</text>
  <text start="144.379" dur="4.531">moving up unemployment moving down GDP</text>
  <text start="146.78" dur="4.789">incredible but if everyone is out of a</text>
  <text start="148.91" dur="5.609">job and corporations are laying off and</text>
  <text start="151.569" dur="5.801">retail stores are closing left and right</text>
  <text start="154.519" dur="5.851">and retail sales are down the tubes and</text>
  <text start="157.37" dur="4.619">the housing market collapses those</text>
  <text start="160.37" dur="7.17">numbers at a certain point will be</text>
  <text start="161.989" dur="8.25">meaningless think back to 2006 7 8 when</text>
  <text start="167.54" dur="4.86">they said that entire time that the</text>
  <text start="170.239" dur="4.86">subprime securities were triple-a they</text>
  <text start="172.4" dur="5.46">kept him at triple-a when everything was</text>
  <text start="175.099" dur="5.881">falling apart think about that for a</text>
  <text start="177.86" dur="5.7">second it was fake it was an illusion</text>
  <text start="180.98" dur="4.83">the same things happening right now now</text>
  <text start="183.56" dur="3.39">wolf Richter puts together a very nice</text>
  <text start="185.81" dur="3.66">picture</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="5.61">the housing bubble and he tracks the</text>
  <text start="189.47" dur="5.64">case-shiller homes and this is 20 cities</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="5.94">around the country and shows how the</text>
  <text start="195.11" dur="8.19">housing bubble is much larger than the</text>
  <text start="198.5" dur="8.04">2008 bubble if we look right now at the</text>
  <text start="203.3" dur="6.659">case-shiller US home price index we see</text>
  <text start="206.54" dur="8.04">that the first housing bubble was around</text>
  <text start="209.959" dur="7.25">a hundred and eighty five or so then it</text>
  <text start="214.58" dur="9.87">dropped all the way down to about 135</text>
  <text start="217.209" dur="11.191">now it is above 225 so it&amp;#39;s in 11.5</text>
  <text start="224.45" dur="7.61">percent increase from the peak of July</text>
  <text start="228.4" dur="6.25">2006 that was housing bubble number one</text>
  <text start="232.06" dur="4.48">when we look at what has been going on</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="4.559">here we can see that growth now is</text>
  <text start="236.54" dur="5.97">slowing everything is starting to change</text>
  <text start="239.209" dur="6.06">and if we go through city by city we can</text>
  <text start="242.51" dur="5.43">see that everything is changing if we</text>
  <text start="245.269" dur="5.521">look at Seattle right now we can see the</text>
  <text start="247.94" dur="7.56">first housing bubble we are 32 percent</text>
  <text start="250.79" dur="9.199">higher than the bubble back in 2007 2008</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="7.979">2009 if we go back and look at Boston</text>
  <text start="259.989" dur="5.65">the housing bubble back then well right</text>
  <text start="263.479" dur="7.801">now we&amp;#39;re eighteen point seven percent</text>
  <text start="265.639" dur="9.03">higher than what it was back in the pre</text>
  <text start="271.28" dur="7.98">recession recession highs if we look at</text>
  <text start="274.669" dur="7.141">Denver we&amp;#39;re 55 percent higher than the</text>
  <text start="279.26" dur="7.17">first housing bubble if we look at</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="7.56">Dallas we are 48 percent higher then the</text>
  <text start="286.43" dur="3.989">housing bubble back in Oh ant oh 9 if we</text>
  <text start="289.37" dur="5.549">look at Atlanta</text>
  <text start="290.419" dur="8.791">we are 8 percent higher now Atlanta took</text>
  <text start="294.919" dur="7.591">a huge fall during the recession I mean</text>
  <text start="299.21" dur="5.97">they went down 37 percent so the housing</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="7.58">bubble in Atlanta was really pumped up</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="8.52">around 45 percent if we look at Portland</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="7.9">we are 26% higher than that</text>
  <text start="313.7" dur="6.28">San Francisco 40% higher I mean you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.99" dur="3.91">starting to get the picture here</text>
  <text start="319.98" dur="4.95">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the central</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="5.88">bank hedge funds investment companies</text>
  <text start="324.93" dur="4.74">Wall Street they pumped these bubbles up</text>
  <text start="327.78" dur="7.05">to Heights that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="329.67" dur="7.92">and if and not if but when these housing</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="5.19">bubbles pop because they always do we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="337.59" dur="5.73">seen it back in 2008 we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="6.3">before this and when it comes down it</text>
  <text start="343.32" dur="6.18">comes down hard and remember this time</text>
  <text start="346.32" dur="5.25">this wasn&amp;#39;t 8 peeples driven bubble it</text>
  <text start="349.5" dur="4.32">was a central bank that pumped this</text>
  <text start="351.57" dur="4.86">bubble up alone and of course yesterday</text>
  <text start="353.82" dur="5.4">used easy money they had hedge funds</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="5.1">investment companies banks buying up</text>
  <text start="359.22" dur="4.95">homes trying to rent them if they can</text>
  <text start="361.53" dur="6.81">keep them off the market just hold on to</text>
  <text start="364.17" dur="6.27">them because a shortage in housing makes</text>
  <text start="368.34" dur="3.24">the bubbles increase because people</text>
  <text start="370.44" dur="3.24">think whoa a lot of people are looking</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="4.53">for homes there&amp;#39;s no homes out there wow</text>
  <text start="373.68" dur="4.08">I can&amp;#39;t find anything and people start</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="5.4">raising their prices because there&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="377.76" dur="6.09">know supply and demand so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="381.51" dur="5.46">seeing here is that these bubbles have</text>
  <text start="383.85" dur="5.04">hit all-time new highs around the globe</text>
  <text start="386.97" dur="4.92">like in the euro zone we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="388.89" dur="7.35">see things are rapidly falling apart the</text>
  <text start="391.89" dur="6.57">euro area GDP only increased by 0.2% in</text>
  <text start="396.24" dur="4.29">the third quarter half the pace of the</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="3.81">previous three months and half the point</text>
  <text start="400.53" dur="4.38">four percent consensus forecast</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="6.71">it was the slowest growth rate since</text>
  <text start="404.91" dur="8.58">2014 now Germany and Italy both missed</text>
  <text start="408.98" dur="6.19">they are they ground to a halt and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="5.1">starting to see there&amp;#39;s huge amount of</text>
  <text start="415.17" dur="5.61">problems in Italy right now everything</text>
  <text start="418.59" dur="5.79">is going to start to fall apart very</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="7.17">very quickly once all this goes and we</text>
  <text start="424.38" dur="5.13">can see that the ECB well if GDP and</text>
  <text start="427.95" dur="3.78">these statistical numbers are not doing</text>
  <text start="429.51" dur="4.25">what they want to do they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="431.73" dur="5.87">to end tightening they&amp;#39;re going to delay</text>
  <text start="433.76" dur="6.43">tightening which tells you they&amp;#39;re stuck</text>
  <text start="437.6" dur="4.33">the Fed right now they&amp;#39;re raising</text>
  <text start="440.19" dur="3.15">interest rates the ECB not doing</text>
  <text start="441.93" dur="4.35">anything that tells you something that</text>
  <text start="443.34" dur="7.86">tells you there&amp;#39;s a plan in action right</text>
  <text start="446.28" dur="7.47">now in the US now the EU they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="451.2" dur="5.13">to figure out a way to keep their</text>
  <text start="453.75" dur="6.06">Iranian nuclear deal and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="6.78">to come up with an Iran oil trade</text>
  <text start="459.81" dur="4.95">payment vehicle and this is a huge</text>
  <text start="463.11" dur="3.78">problem for them because there is no EU</text>
  <text start="464.76" dur="4.89">country that wants to be the anchor</text>
  <text start="466.89" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re afraid of what the United States</text>
  <text start="469.65" dur="7.62">might do if they are the anchor country</text>
  <text start="473.31" dur="6.75">so once again Iran is in trouble here</text>
  <text start="477.27" dur="4.41">and we can see that eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="3.39">going to happen they&amp;#39;re gonna be talking</text>
  <text start="481.68" dur="4.86">to the United States to talk about a new</text>
  <text start="483.45" dur="5.85">deal and all these countries well</text>
  <text start="486.54" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to renegotiate now we</text>
  <text start="489.3" dur="6.66">know that Trump has been attacking the</text>
  <text start="492.63" dur="6.36">central bank contradicting the central</text>
  <text start="495.96" dur="5.4">bank pointing out specifically that as</text>
  <text start="498.99" dur="5.04">you raise the interest rates it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="501.36" dur="4.559">to hurt the economy and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="504.03" dur="3.69">interesting is the central bankers out</text>
  <text start="505.919" dur="3.891">there and they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="5.16">possibly can to counter to fight back</text>
  <text start="509.81" dur="6.849">against what Trump is doing because they</text>
  <text start="512.88" dur="6.39">know when this system falls apart they</text>
  <text start="516.659" dur="3.991">know they&amp;#39;re going to be blamed now the</text>
  <text start="519.27" dur="3.86">bank of all banks the Bank of</text>
  <text start="520.65" dur="7.58">International Settlement they are</text>
  <text start="523.13" dur="8.59">referring to a paper that is explaining</text>
  <text start="528.23" dur="6.94">why raising the interest rates does not</text>
  <text start="531.72" dur="6.9">hurt the economy now this is a little</text>
  <text start="535.17" dur="5.28">piece from that paper the substantial</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="5.76">increase in the federal funds rate from</text>
  <text start="540.45" dur="6.33">mid 2004 reinforced by higher policy</text>
  <text start="544.38" dur="4.5">rates elsewhere did not prevent further</text>
  <text start="546.78" dur="3.57">increases in risk taking in the</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="4.68">financial markets during this period</text>
  <text start="550.35" dur="5.01">Turner wrote in a 2017 paper titled did</text>
  <text start="553.56" dur="4.44">central banks cause the last financial</text>
  <text start="555.36" dur="4.41">crisis will they cause the next now what</text>
  <text start="558" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re trying to do here is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="4.35">trying to explain away why higher</text>
  <text start="562.05" dur="3.42">interest rates will not have an effect</text>
  <text start="564.12" dur="3.51">on the economy</text>
  <text start="565.47" dur="3.9">now remember Paul Volcker he was being</text>
  <text start="567.63" dur="3.209">interviewed with the New York Times and</text>
  <text start="569.37" dur="3.93">he actually brought down the economy</text>
  <text start="570.839" dur="3.781">with raising the interest rates but what</text>
  <text start="573.3" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re saying is it&amp;#39;s different this</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="4.62">time actually it&amp;#39;s much much worse and</text>
  <text start="576.51" dur="6.48">yes it is different and we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="579.24" dur="5.46">interest rates this low and we know when</text>
  <text start="582.99" dur="3.81">the interest rates hit a certain point</text>
  <text start="584.7" dur="2.74">that&amp;#39;s when the economy starts to fall</text>
  <text start="586.8" dur="2.5">apart</text>
  <text start="587.44" dur="4.02">and what the central bank likes to do is</text>
  <text start="589.3" dur="4.2">they like to hit that point and then</text>
  <text start="591.46" dur="4.32">they bring the interest rates down very</text>
  <text start="593.5" dur="4.23">very quickly so it looks like nothing</text>
  <text start="595.78" dur="3.99">really happened and for a period of time</text>
  <text start="597.73" dur="4.02">within maybe a year it seems like</text>
  <text start="599.77" dur="4.44">nothing is happening but the Avalanche</text>
  <text start="601.75" dur="3.57">has already started you can&amp;#39;t see it on</text>
  <text start="604.21" dur="2.85">the top of the hill it looks like a</text>
  <text start="605.32" dur="3.69">little bit of dust and it starts rolling</text>
  <text start="607.06" dur="4.29">down the hill it&amp;#39;s getting bigger and</text>
  <text start="609.01" dur="5.67">bigger but by the time it hits the</text>
  <text start="611.35" dur="5.07">bottom no one realizes that at the top</text>
  <text start="614.68" dur="3.72">it was the interest rates that actually</text>
  <text start="616.42" dur="4.02">caused it all they see is the</text>
  <text start="618.4" dur="4.11">destruction and the central banks say</text>
  <text start="620.44" dur="3.54">hey it&amp;#39;s been a year now had nothing to</text>
  <text start="622.51" dur="3.39">do with the interest rates that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="623.98" dur="4.14">actually what happens it takes a little</text>
  <text start="625.9" dur="5.1">bit of time before the interest rates</text>
  <text start="628.12" dur="5.31">kick in and once they hit the tipping</text>
  <text start="631" dur="4.53">point that&amp;#39;s when they start reducing</text>
  <text start="633.43" dur="3.18">the rates very very quickly I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="635.53" dur="3.27">talking about oh let&amp;#39;s bring it down</text>
  <text start="636.61" dur="4.23">point to five percent this quarter I</text>
  <text start="638.8" dur="4.83">mean they&amp;#39;re dropping at full percentage</text>
  <text start="640.84" dur="5.1">rate you know each quarter maybe two</text>
  <text start="643.63" dur="4.2">times a quarter that&amp;#39;s how fast they</text>
  <text start="645.94" dur="3.95">were bringing them down so no one would</text>
  <text start="647.83" dur="4.65">know what was really happening and</text>
  <text start="649.89" dur="5.05">they&amp;#39;re trying to fight back now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="652.48" dur="5.1">trying to produce papers and show that</text>
  <text start="654.94" dur="4.05">raising the interest rates this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="657.58" dur="2.97">do anything doesn&amp;#39;t affect the economy</text>
  <text start="658.99" dur="3.33">and if you notice it&amp;#39;s coming from the</text>
  <text start="660.55" dur="3.57">Bank of International Settlements eithe</text>
  <text start="662.32" dur="4.2">uh IMF out there trying to fight back</text>
  <text start="664.12" dur="5.67">because they know in the end they are</text>
  <text start="666.52" dur="5.58">going to be blamed their plan is out the</text>
  <text start="669.79" dur="3.66">window they had a plan it was set they</text>
  <text start="672.1" dur="2.31">were going to move the entire system</text>
  <text start="673.45" dur="2.67">someplace else</text>
  <text start="674.41" dur="3.54">there was going to be this incredible</text>
  <text start="676.12" dur="3.96">event where they can explain away why</text>
  <text start="677.95" dur="5.07">all of this is happening maybe almost</text>
  <text start="680.08" dur="4.98">like in the 70s when we were coming off</text>
  <text start="683.02" dur="3.9">the gold standard they were saying oh</text>
  <text start="685.06" dur="3.48">they were gold speculators and</text>
  <text start="686.92" dur="3.51">everything like this and this is why</text>
  <text start="688.54" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re seeing this but behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="690.43" dur="3.84">what they were really doing is they were</text>
  <text start="692.44" dur="3.72">switching us to the petrodollar system</text>
  <text start="694.27" dur="3.96">but they really didn&amp;#39;t want anyone to</text>
  <text start="696.16" dur="3.21">know about that back then today it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="698.23" dur="3.27">little bit harder because now we have</text>
  <text start="699.37" dur="3.719">the internet now we have people talking</text>
  <text start="701.5" dur="4.17">to each other now we have people</text>
  <text start="703.089" dur="4.201">realizing what was done in the past and</text>
  <text start="705.67" dur="2.39">we could see what&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="707.29" dur="4.14">future</text>
  <text start="708.06" dur="6.58">hmm sounds like cue future proves past</text>
  <text start="711.43" dur="4.8">but anyhow we can see they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="714.64" dur="4.56">fight back right now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="716.23" dur="4.84">use whatever they have to say trump is</text>
  <text start="719.2" dur="3.85">wrong but at this</text>
  <text start="721.07" dur="3.48">Trump is going to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="2.46">number just saying Trump himself I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="724.55" dur="3">saying all those people there working</text>
  <text start="725.51" dur="4.44">with him he&amp;#39;s going to control the</text>
  <text start="727.55" dur="4.79">narrative and there&amp;#39;s no way out of this</text>
  <text start="729.95" dur="4.95">for the central bank they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="732.34" dur="4.72">everything I mean they&amp;#39;re gonna put out</text>
  <text start="734.9" dur="4.32">papers they&amp;#39;re gonna put out stories in</text>
  <text start="737.06" dur="4.2">the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="739.22" dur="5.49">whatever they possibly can because they</text>
  <text start="741.26" dur="4.68">need this to go away because once they</text>
  <text start="744.71" dur="2.46">are blamed it&amp;#39;s going to be like a</text>
  <text start="745.94" dur="2.91">domino effect well if the Fed is</text>
  <text start="747.17" dur="3.81">responsible then the IMF must</text>
  <text start="748.85" dur="3.99">responsible if the IMF is responsible</text>
  <text start="750.98" dur="4.83">then the biz must be responsible they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="752.84" dur="7.11">all connected maybe we don&amp;#39;t need this</text>
  <text start="755.81" dur="6.48">and if Russia China they all chime in at</text>
  <text start="759.95" dur="3.87">the same time and they all and all these</text>
  <text start="762.29" dur="2.82">countries say we don&amp;#39;t need this the</text>
  <text start="763.82" dur="4.08">private western central bank system</text>
  <text start="765.11" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re going to manage it ourselves</text>
  <text start="767.9" dur="2.85">the people of each one of these</text>
  <text start="769.37" dur="4.35">countries the governments of these</text>
  <text start="770.75" dur="5.07">countries we&amp;#39;re gonna create the</text>
  <text start="773.72" dur="4.92">currency with no interest attached the</text>
  <text start="775.82" dur="6.75">central bank is finished and I believe</text>
  <text start="778.64" dur="5.97">this is the ultimate plan because if one</text>
  <text start="782.57" dur="3.99">country tries to do it the central bank</text>
  <text start="784.61" dur="4.95">can either bring you know the countries</text>
  <text start="786.56" dur="5.58">to war or try to stop it if multiple</text>
  <text start="789.56" dur="5.61">countries are on the same page</text>
  <text start="792.14" dur="6.51">this is very difficult for the central</text>
  <text start="795.17" dur="6.69">bank to handle and this is the plan this</text>
  <text start="798.65" dur="6.33">is the push and this is the only way to</text>
  <text start="801.86" dur="5.7">get rid of this system the way we see it</text>
  <text start="804.98" dur="4.71">today and get rid of the private western</text>
  <text start="807.56" dur="3.75">central bank system but one thing is for</text>
  <text start="809.69" dur="4.56">sure and I don&amp;#39;t want to forget about</text>
  <text start="811.31" dur="4.92">this is that to get there we have to go</text>
  <text start="814.25" dur="3.24">through a transition there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="816.23" dur="4.02">around the Semin you&amp;#39;re coming off one</text>
  <text start="817.49" dur="4.44">system going on to another I believe</text>
  <text start="820.25" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it as easy as</text>
  <text start="821.93" dur="5.19">possible this is why you see the tariffs</text>
  <text start="824.15" dur="5.49">that tax you know relief and things like</text>
  <text start="827.12" dur="4.53">that they&amp;#39;re going to try to make it as</text>
  <text start="829.64" dur="4.17">easy as possible if it was the central</text>
  <text start="831.65" dur="4.62">banks in the deep state they wanted a</text>
  <text start="833.81" dur="5.43">disaster they wanted it to look bad this</text>
  <text start="836.27" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to you know roll it</text>
  <text start="839.24" dur="4.62">over to the new system and keep the</text>
  <text start="841.37" dur="4.44">transition very short but a lot of</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="3.24">people are going to get hurt a lot of</text>
  <text start="845.81" dur="3.33">people are not gonna be prepared for</text>
  <text start="847.1" dur="3.93">this a lot of people are going to lose a</text>
  <text start="849.14" dur="2.76">lot of their wealth there&amp;#39;s just no way</text>

  <text start="871.72" dur="4.81">emergency plus supplies water food and</text>
  <text start="874.88" dur="3.21">things like that because as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="876.53" dur="3.81">transitioning if you look at countries</text>
  <text start="878.09" dur="3.81">around the world like Russia when they</text>
  <text start="880.34" dur="3.84">were transitioning out of the Soviet</text>
