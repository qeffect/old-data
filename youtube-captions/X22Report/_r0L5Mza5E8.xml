  <text start="38.579" dur="4.771">August 29 2 2016 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="3.599">episode is the propaganda for the</text>
  <text start="43.35" dur="4.83">perfect storm this fall is now being</text>
  <text start="45.269" dur="5.371">pushed let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="48.18" dur="6">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="50.64" dur="6.39">now a couple days ago DC leaks came out</text>
  <text start="54.18" dur="5.85">with a 2,500 internal open society</text>
  <text start="57.03" dur="4.59">foundation document to shed light on one</text>
  <text start="60.03" dur="4.29">of the most influential networks</text>
  <text start="61.62" dur="5.67">operating worldwide and we talked about</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="5.31">how Soros Obama the UN were involved in</text>
  <text start="67.29" dur="4.86">the European refugee crisis how they</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="5.129">created it we also talked about how</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="5.579">Soros wanted to overthrow the Russian</text>
  <text start="74.759" dur="5.731">government and after the website DC</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="4.5">leaks posted the source documents it</text>
  <text start="80.49" dur="5.22">looks like its website was yanked off</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="5.64">line and the Twitter account was also</text>
  <text start="85.71" dur="5.22">suspended so you can see these</text>
  <text start="87.869" dur="6.031">individuals they are aware of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="5.939">going on and just like uh dawuan out in</text>
  <text start="93.9" dur="5.579">Turkey whenever something is out there</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="4.591">talking about what they&amp;#39;re up to it</text>
  <text start="99.479" dur="5.611">seems like they take action and they</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="9.929">shut things down now as we know the FBI</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="8.069">CIA NSA the everyday police they hardly</text>
  <text start="111.389" dur="4.8">use warrants when they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="113.159" dur="7.681">cell phone data emails and things like</text>
  <text start="116.189" dur="6.45">that and we realize and understand that</text>
  <text start="120.84" dur="3.449">they believe this doesn&amp;#39;t fall under the</text>
  <text start="122.639" dur="3.601">Fourth Amendment and of course the</text>
  <text start="124.289" dur="3.631">government makes up their own laws to</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="3.81">try to override the Fourth Amendment but</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="4.56">to remember there&amp;#39;s no law or anything</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="5.55">out there that overrides the rights of</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="5.729">the people and a federal district court</text>
  <text start="135.6" dur="4.26">in DC ordered a seizure of alonzo</text>
  <text start="138.209" dur="5.36">Marlo&amp;#39;s cell service location</text>
  <text start="139.86" dur="6.39">information held by his cell provider it</text>
  <text start="143.569" dur="6.461">held that the federal government didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="146.25" dur="6.74">need a warrant at all to obtain the CSL</text>
  <text start="150.03" dur="7.319">I data from a person&amp;#39;s phone provider</text>
  <text start="152.99" dur="8.65">now all the agencies they use the stored</text>
  <text start="157.349" dur="7.171">Communications Act of 1986 which governs</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="6.75">the searching of such data under section</text>
  <text start="164.52" dur="5.64">2703 d of the Act the federal</text>
  <text start="168.39" dur="5.04">investigators need not demonstrate</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="7.71">probable cause in order to search all</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="7.38">they need to do is merely show some</text>
  <text start="177.87" dur="6.78">facts that there is maybe some type of</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="5.34">criminal wrongdoing and the Fourth</text>
  <text start="184.65" dur="4.95">Amendment is then thrown out the window</text>
  <text start="186.15" dur="6.06">and of course this is the excuse that</text>
  <text start="189.6" dur="4.17">they use saying that the FC we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="192.21" dur="4.38">have to abide by the Fourth Amendment</text>
  <text start="193.77" dur="7.17">we&amp;#39;re going by the stored Communications</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="6.87">Act of 1986 and we&amp;#39;re using this which</text>
  <text start="200.94" dur="4.17">overrides the Fourth Amendment but you</text>
  <text start="203.46" dur="4.05">really need to read the Fourth Amendment</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="5.04">because it says the right of the people</text>
  <text start="207.51" dur="7.01">to be secure in their persons houses</text>
  <text start="210.15" dur="7.59">papers and effects against unreasonable</text>
  <text start="214.52" dur="6.85">searches and seizures shall not be</text>
  <text start="217.74" dur="7.43">violated violated and no warrants shall</text>
  <text start="221.37" dur="9.18">issue but upon probable cause supported</text>
  <text start="225.17" dur="9.91">by oath or affirmation so when you hear</text>
  <text start="230.55" dur="6.03">this you can see right now that they</text>
  <text start="235.08" dur="5.07">have violated the Fourth Amendment now</text>
  <text start="236.58" dur="5.34">the Cato Institute they filed a motion</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="4.32">with the US Court of Appeals for the DC</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="5.31">Circuit supporting the appeal of more</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="4.56">low and his co-defendants for the</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="5.22">purposes of the Fourth Amendment cell</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="4.89">phone data is a paper or effect in which</text>
  <text start="252.45" dur="5.22">there is a right of the people to be</text>
  <text start="253.92" dur="6.48">secure the Supreme Court made clear in</text>
  <text start="257.67" dur="5.16">Riley verse California in 2014 they</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="4.89">giving police carte blanche to search a</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="4.74">phone incident to an arrest would infect</text>
  <text start="265.29" dur="5.28">give police officers unbridled</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="8.82">discretion to rummage at will among a</text>
  <text start="270.57" dur="7.64">person&amp;#39;s private effects now more low is</text>
  <text start="276.39" dur="6.74">protected under the Fourth Amendment it</text>
  <text start="278.21" dur="8.44">is his effects and it does not allow</text>
  <text start="283.13" dur="7.71">agencies the government to look at this</text>
  <text start="286.65" dur="8.1">I mean if you really think about it</text>
  <text start="290.84" dur="7.48">allowing warrantless searches of the CSL</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="7.68">I violates privacy as much as rummaging</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="8.91">a person&amp;#39;s physical papers back in 1776</text>
  <text start="302.43" dur="6.78">there really is no difference and we can</text>
  <text start="307.23" dur="4.44">see right now the United States</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="4.86">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.67" dur="4.8">trying to get around the rights of the</text>
  <text start="314.07" dur="5.76">people and they continually try to do</text>
  <text start="316.47" dur="7.23">this by creating other laws but nothing</text>
  <text start="319.83" dur="5.91">overrides the rights of the people it</text>
  <text start="323.7" dur="5.73">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s electronic or</text>
  <text start="325.74" dur="7.95">paper it is your effects it&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="7.68">information and unless they get a</text>
  <text start="333.69" dur="8.34">warrant they have no right to it this is</text>
  <text start="337.11" dur="7.74">why the founding fathers created all of</text>
  <text start="342.03" dur="3.93">this they didn&amp;#39;t do it because they say</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="3.47">hey you know this would be good to have</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="5.91">they did it because they understood what</text>
  <text start="348.32" dur="6.58">governments do how they get around the</text>
  <text start="351.87" dur="4.83">laws how they do it for the best</text>
  <text start="354.9" dur="3.75">interest of themselves and not for the</text>
  <text start="356.7" dur="4.41">people there was nothing protecting the</text>
  <text start="358.65" dur="5.58">people and what they did was they</text>
  <text start="361.11" dur="6.03">created the Constitution the rights for</text>
  <text start="364.23" dur="5.37">the people to protect them against a</text>
  <text start="367.14" dur="6.42">tyrannical government and that is what</text>
  <text start="369.6" dur="6.45">we&amp;#39;re seeing today now we understand the</text>
  <text start="373.56" dur="5.01">Department of Defense they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="4.92">falsifying accounting records in a tune</text>
  <text start="378.57" dur="5.49">of about six point five trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="380.97" dur="4.53">and of course they just can&amp;#39;t find that</text>
  <text start="384.06" dur="4.5">anywhere because you know it just</text>
  <text start="385.5" dur="5.34">disappeared now a private company if</text>
  <text start="388.56" dur="3.45">they ever did that individuals would be</text>
  <text start="390.84" dur="3.24">arrested and they would have gone to</text>
  <text start="392.01" dur="4.74">jail but not in the government they say</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="4.98">oh it was a mixup you know we falsified</text>
  <text start="396.75" dur="6.03">these things all the time can&amp;#39;t blame us</text>
  <text start="399.06" dur="5.52">where government people well if they</text>
  <text start="402.78" dur="6">can&amp;#39;t find six point five trillion</text>
  <text start="404.58" dur="6.57">dollars how do we know that the</text>
  <text start="408.78" dur="6.72">Department of Defense is actually</text>
  <text start="411.15" dur="7.47">providing security for the people that</text>
  <text start="415.5" dur="9.06">they&amp;#39;re spending trillions of taxpayer</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="9.18">dollars to protect the United States if</text>
  <text start="424.56" dur="5.15">they falsified a document where they</text>
  <text start="427.8" dur="4.39">can&amp;#39;t find six point five trillion</text>
  <text start="429.71" dur="5.9">wouldn&amp;#39;t you think they&amp;#39;d falsify</text>
  <text start="432.19" dur="6.12">else then and lie where all this is</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="7.02">going that they&amp;#39;re really not providing</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="7.35">any type of security and if this is the</text>
  <text start="442.63" dur="6.44">case we need a full investigation of</text>
  <text start="445.66" dur="5.79">what is going on here now out in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="5.38">we see something very interesting</text>
  <text start="451.45" dur="5.85">happening here we see Ukraine secretly</text>
  <text start="454.45" dur="6.72">announces the seventh large-scale</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="6.9">mobilization and they are bringing more</text>
  <text start="461.17" dur="5.94">and more troops up to the contact line</text>
  <text start="464.2" dur="6.21">and it really looks like they are</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="4.71">preparing for something huge here and we</text>
  <text start="470.41" dur="4.53">know that Russia is out there</text>
  <text start="471.82" dur="6.12">continually calling on Ukraine to calm</text>
  <text start="474.94" dur="5.58">the situation down let&amp;#39;s get back to the</text>
  <text start="477.94" dur="5.84">mints to cease fire let&amp;#39;s have a</text>
  <text start="480.52" dur="5.37">ceasefire but we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="483.78" dur="6.25">united states government the central</text>
  <text start="485.89" dur="6.24">bankers they want a full-out war they</text>
  <text start="490.03" dur="6.21">want this to get started one way or</text>
  <text start="492.13" dur="7.26">another and I would expect we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="496.24" dur="7.23">to see some type of false flag event</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="6.75">occur in this area very soon we almost</text>
  <text start="503.47" dur="5.58">had one in Crimea where they sent teams</text>
  <text start="506.14" dur="5.73">into Crimea to to destroy the</text>
  <text start="509.05" dur="5.76">infrastructure there and I can see right</text>
  <text start="511.87" dur="6.24">now they&amp;#39;re preparing for another type</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="6.27">of false flag to try to provoke the</text>
  <text start="518.11" dur="6.059">southeastern or cry million people into</text>
  <text start="521.08" dur="5.31">a war this is where they are headed</text>
  <text start="524.169" dur="4.831">right now and we need to watch the</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="4.83">situation very very carefully now over</text>
  <text start="529" dur="4.38">the past couple of months and just</text>
  <text start="531.22" dur="5.25">recently we see that the United States</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="7.13">is provoking you know China Russia North</text>
  <text start="536.47" dur="7.41">Korea and Iran we also see that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="540.51" dur="6.49">attempted to fly a drone into Iranian</text>
  <text start="543.88" dur="5.459">airspace now the Iranians warned the</text>
  <text start="547" dur="6.24">u.s. saying do not enter this area if</text>
  <text start="549.339" dur="6.601">you do we will shoot it down so once the</text>
  <text start="553.24" dur="5.16">warning came out the u.s. turned the</text>
  <text start="555.94" dur="5.63">drone around and flew off in the</text>
  <text start="558.4" dur="6.06">opposite direction we see Iran right now</text>
  <text start="561.57" dur="4.54">they are setting up the Russian s-300</text>
  <text start="564.46" dur="5.7">surface-to-air missiles</text>
  <text start="566.11" dur="6.96">at its Fordow nuclear facility they are</text>
  <text start="570.16" dur="4.71">doing it to protect their entire area</text>
  <text start="573.07" dur="6.42">right there because they are getting</text>
  <text start="574.87" dur="7.95">word that something might occur and of</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="4.86">course as we know as time goes on the</text>
  <text start="582.82" dur="3.48">entire plane of the United States</text>
  <text start="584.35" dur="3.929">government central bankers was to go</text>
  <text start="586.3" dur="5.159">into Syria and then eventually go into</text>
  <text start="588.279" dur="6.511">Iran and we can see through this entire</text>
  <text start="591.459" dur="5.19">p5 plus one piece deal that it did not</text>
  <text start="594.79" dur="5.43">go in the way the United States wanted</text>
  <text start="596.649" dur="5.161">they wanted Iran to put their oil on the</text>
  <text start="600.22" dur="4.08">dollar they decided to go with the euro</text>
  <text start="601.81" dur="5.61">eventually they will then go most likely</text>
  <text start="604.3" dur="5.49">with the one or ruble and move further</text>
  <text start="607.42" dur="4.62">and further away from the dollar the one</text>
  <text start="609.79" dur="8.46">thing that the United States was able to</text>
  <text start="612.04" dur="8.13">do was to keep Iran a non-nuclear state</text>
  <text start="618.25" dur="5.61">where they don&amp;#39;t have a nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="620.17" dur="8.82">because if you notice the US government</text>
  <text start="623.86" dur="9.719">loves to go into those countries that</text>
  <text start="628.99" dur="6.33">don&amp;#39;t have nuclear weapons and basically</text>
  <text start="633.579" dur="4.911">have regime change in those countries</text>
  <text start="635.32" dur="6.629">and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do out in</text>
  <text start="638.49" dur="5.2">North Korea is get rid of their nuclear</text>
  <text start="641.949" dur="4.981">weapons because it will make it easier</text>
  <text start="643.69" dur="6.389">for them to have regime change in that</text>
  <text start="646.93" dur="7.74">country and those countries that do have</text>
  <text start="650.079" dur="5.971">nuclear weapons it poses a problem we</text>
  <text start="654.67" dur="2.88">see the US government is out there</text>
  <text start="656.05" dur="5.07">saying that it knows it&amp;#39;s no longer</text>
  <text start="657.55" dur="5.01">against al-qaeda and we can see that</text>
  <text start="661.12" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re only going after the Islamic</text>
  <text start="662.56" dur="3.209">state well they&amp;#39;re really not going</text>
  <text start="664.3" dur="3.87">after the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re letting</text>
  <text start="665.769" dur="4.081">the Islamic state scurry off they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="668.17" dur="3.27">fighting al-qaeda because that is their</text>
  <text start="669.85" dur="4.01">proxy army the Islamic state is their</text>
  <text start="671.44" dur="6">proxy army and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="673.86" dur="4.96">since the name change of al-qaeda into a</text>
  <text start="677.44" dur="3.87">different name al-nusrah into a</text>
  <text start="678.82" dur="3.66">different name we see the u.s. now says</text>
  <text start="681.31" dur="3.48">okay they&amp;#39;re not a terrorist group that</text>
  <text start="682.48" dur="5.219">out on the UN terrorist group list and</text>
  <text start="684.79" dur="6.169">we can supply them with arms and this is</text>
  <text start="687.699" dur="6.841">exactly what the US is doing right now</text>
  <text start="690.959" dur="6.19">now we see that turkey is invading Syria</text>
  <text start="694.54" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re moving deeper and deeper into</text>
  <text start="697.149" dur="5.041">this area and</text>
  <text start="699.49" dur="5.67">there are warnings now where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="702.19" dur="5.58">telling the Kurds to back off to get on</text>
  <text start="705.16" dur="8.97">to the other side of the Euphrates River</text>
  <text start="707.77" dur="8.819">and what I see happening here is the US</text>
  <text start="714.13" dur="5.16">and Turkey working together creating</text>
  <text start="716.589" dur="4.591">chaos yes they have their cover story</text>
  <text start="719.29" dur="4.89">there go they&amp;#39;re both going after the</text>
  <text start="721.18" dur="4.62">Islamic state and Turkey is also going</text>
  <text start="724.18" dur="3.42">after the Kurds at the same time and I</text>
  <text start="725.8" dur="5.07">think the United States they are using</text>
  <text start="727.6" dur="5.85">the Kurds to help them in their mission</text>
  <text start="730.87" dur="5.43">their agenda and their mission is to get</text>
  <text start="733.45" dur="4.98">Assad and with turkey coming into the</text>
  <text start="736.3" dur="6.24">northern part of Syria the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="738.43" dur="6.84">was just allowed to leave and Turkey was</text>
  <text start="742.54" dur="7.109">able to capture that area very very</text>
  <text start="745.27" dur="6.509">quickly with really no resistance and we</text>
  <text start="749.649" dur="4.171">can see right now they are spreading out</text>
  <text start="751.779" dur="3.631">in the northern area because this has</text>
  <text start="753.82" dur="5.19">been their plan from the beginning to</text>
  <text start="755.41" dur="6">create a corridor to create a buffer</text>
  <text start="759.01" dur="5.34">zone in this area where they can use</text>
  <text start="761.41" dur="5.97">this as a forward launch base into the</text>
  <text start="764.35" dur="6.21">rest of Syria we see the United States</text>
  <text start="767.38" dur="5.1">giving warnings now to Turkey you know</text>
  <text start="770.56" dur="3.779">stopped hitting the Kurds but it looks</text>
  <text start="772.48" dur="5.76">like they&amp;#39;re really using the Kurds they</text>
  <text start="774.339" dur="5.49">needed that area to create the bases so</text>
  <text start="778.24" dur="4.62">they can have a launching pad into</text>
  <text start="779.829" dur="6.181">Damascus and it looks like right now</text>
  <text start="782.86" dur="6.33">that Turkey and the u.s. might be really</text>
  <text start="786.01" dur="6.51">working together they might be putting</text>
  <text start="789.19" dur="10.32">one over on Russia and it looks like</text>
  <text start="792.52" dur="10.89">their entire agenda is the same as it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="799.51" dur="6.81">always been to go after Assad and remove</text>
  <text start="803.41" dur="5.46">and of course they&amp;#39;re using this cover</text>
  <text start="806.32" dur="4.259">story that we&amp;#39;re going after the Islamic</text>
  <text start="808.87" dur="4.469">state we&amp;#39;re not doing this but you can</text>
  <text start="810.579" dur="5.911">see from their actions not their words</text>
  <text start="813.339" dur="7.321">their actions that they are creating</text>
  <text start="816.49" dur="8.789">this entire zone in the northern area of</text>
  <text start="820.66" dur="8.13">Syria and we can see this is going to</text>
  <text start="825.279" dur="5.221">really get worse as time goes on this is</text>
  <text start="828.79" dur="4.349">not a good situation talks have broken</text>
  <text start="830.5" dur="5.939">down and the whole situation is</text>
  <text start="833.139" dur="6.6">to escalate as time goes on now we</text>
  <text start="836.439" dur="5.55">talked about a perfect storm coming this</text>
  <text start="839.739" dur="4.231">fall we have the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="841.989" dur="4.5">things are getting worse and worse we</text>
  <text start="843.97" dur="5.88">have war around the globe and then we</text>
  <text start="846.489" dur="5.58">have the elections and we know there are</text>
  <text start="849.85" dur="5.099">two candidates that are up for election</text>
  <text start="852.069" dur="5.85">and we know that the neocons the elite</text>
  <text start="854.949" dur="5.19">the shadow government wants one</text>
  <text start="857.919" dur="5">candidate and doesn&amp;#39;t want the other and</text>
  <text start="860.139" dur="5.28">I don&amp;#39;t really care for either of</text>
  <text start="862.919" dur="4.45">whoever works for the people and only</text>
  <text start="865.419" dur="4.92">the people and not central banks not</text>

  <text start="870.339" dur="4.891">interests that&amp;#39;s the candidate for me</text>
  <text start="873.399" dur="5.13">and the only interest they should have</text>
  <text start="875.23" dur="4.74">is to the people and I know candidates</text>
  <text start="878.529" dur="4.71">say a lot when they&amp;#39;re running for</text>
  <text start="879.97" dur="6.959">office but their actions will speak</text>
  <text start="883.239" dur="5.7">louder than words so right now to me I</text>
  <text start="886.929" dur="4.56">feel that the shadow government the</text>
  <text start="888.939" dur="4.71">elites they still are in control no</text>
  <text start="891.489" dur="5.22">matter who gets into the White House we</text>
  <text start="893.649" dur="4.831">need to get rid of the central bank but</text>
  <text start="896.709" dur="4.17">we can see that the propaganda is</text>
  <text start="898.48" dur="6.779">running wild for this perfect storm the</text>
  <text start="900.879" dur="6.87">FBI has uncovered evidence that foreign</text>
  <text start="905.259" dur="5.58">hackers penetrated to state election</text>
  <text start="907.749" dur="7.351">databases in recent weeks and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="910.839" dur="5.97">warning that it&amp;#39;s the Russians now of</text>
  <text start="915.1" dur="4.62">course they&amp;#39;re showing you the IP</text>
  <text start="916.809" dur="4.95">addresses they&amp;#39;re showing you how they</text>
  <text start="919.72" dur="3.719">got all of this and of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="921.759" dur="4.471">getting this flash alert from the FBI</text>
  <text start="923.439" dur="5.13">cyber division and like I&amp;#39;ve said in the</text>
  <text start="926.23" dur="5.549">past when they come out with this</text>
  <text start="928.569" dur="7.23">information so quickly you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="931.779" dur="6.571">propaganda do you really think a state</text>
  <text start="935.799" dur="4.2">actor like Russia is going to launch</text>
  <text start="938.35" dur="7.88">attack against the United States</text>
  <text start="939.999" dur="9.84">election systems from Russia come on</text>
  <text start="946.23" dur="7.209">they would never do it from that area it</text>
  <text start="949.839" dur="6.06">would bounce off probably thousands of</text>
  <text start="953.439" dur="4.95">different areas around the world so you</text>
  <text start="955.899" dur="3.93">could never trace it back and people</text>
  <text start="958.389" dur="3.331">said well of course you can trace it</text>
  <text start="959.829" dur="4.59">well that&amp;#39;s the case why don&amp;#39;t they just</text>
  <text start="961.72" dur="4.929">eliminate spam why don&amp;#39;t they just get</text>
  <text start="964.419" dur="4.571">rid of all the viruses</text>
  <text start="966.649" dur="5.071">they don&amp;#39;t have the ability that</text>
  <text start="968.99" dur="5.069">everyone thinks they have it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="971.72" dur="5.64">difficult to trace an IP like this</text>
  <text start="974.059" dur="6.601">especially this quickly but what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="977.36" dur="6.269">doing right now is they&amp;#39;re creating the</text>
  <text start="980.66" dur="6.539">propaganda to make you think that the</text>
  <text start="983.629" dur="6.33">election systems can be hacked now we</text>
  <text start="987.199" dur="5.01">have two things going on here we have</text>
  <text start="989.959" dur="5.521">the Zika virus which is spreading in</text>
  <text start="992.209" dur="7.201">Florida cases in New York might be</text>
  <text start="995.48" dur="7.829">moving out towards the west we have the</text>
  <text start="999.41" dur="6.979">election systems that are hacked this is</text>
  <text start="1003.309" dur="6.481">all propaganda they&amp;#39;re setting this up</text>
  <text start="1006.389" dur="6.25">so they have a cover story when things</text>
  <text start="1009.79" dur="5.659">don&amp;#39;t go their way if the elections</text>
  <text start="1012.639" dur="7.62">aren&amp;#39;t going in the direction they want</text>
  <text start="1015.449" dur="8.17">most likely they will have some type of</text>
  <text start="1020.259" dur="5.881">state of emergency now it could be the</text>
  <text start="1023.619" dur="4.53">Zika virus and just one state and they</text>
  <text start="1026.14" dur="4.169">can say listen we need to postpone for a</text>
  <text start="1028.149" dur="4.621">little bit too many people have come</text>
  <text start="1030.309" dur="5.01">down with it too many people have the</text>
  <text start="1032.77" dur="5.34">Zika virus and it&amp;#39;s just not possible to</text>
  <text start="1035.319" dur="5.551">have elections at this point if that</text>
  <text start="1038.11" dur="4.89">doesn&amp;#39;t work if that story is not ready</text>
  <text start="1040.87" dur="4.969">to go they can say the system was hacked</text>
  <text start="1043" dur="6.539">we need to postpone if that doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="1045.839" dur="5.981">the move on to the next story we had a</text>
  <text start="1049.539" dur="6.061">physical attack here we need a state of</text>
  <text start="1051.82" dur="6.359">emergency riots are spreading across the</text>
  <text start="1055.6" dur="4.77">country so you can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1058.179" dur="6.531">getting prepared they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="1060.37" dur="7.2">propaganda to try to delay the elections</text>
  <text start="1064.71" dur="4.51">temporarily of course and every time</text>
  <text start="1067.57" dur="3.989">they say temporarily you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1069.22" dur="4.02">permanent so this is something we need</text>
  <text start="1071.559" dur="5.37">to watch and we can see the propaganda</text>
  <text start="1073.24" dur="6.569">is really being pushed on the American</text>
  <text start="1076.929" dur="6.391">people now there was an interesting</text>
  <text start="1079.809" dur="6.36">article by megan stewart on survival</text>

  <text start="1089.679" dur="4.141">collapse and i thought it was very</text>
  <text start="1092.169" dur="3.87">interesting because she started off</text>
  <text start="1093.82" dur="4.44">saying if you&amp;#39;re waiting for a public</text>

  <text start="1115.359" dur="7.35">right off the bat that came much much</text>
  <text start="1118.45" dur="8.399">later what she&amp;#39;s saying here is that</text>
