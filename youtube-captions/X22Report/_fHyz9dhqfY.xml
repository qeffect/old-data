  <text start="131.07" dur="4.919">well they are starting to stall and</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="4.26">things are going in the opposite</text>
  <text start="135.989" dur="5.25">direction now we know the UK they are</text>
  <text start="138.18" dur="6.779">trying to leave the EU and we mentioned</text>
  <text start="141.239" dur="7.441">yesterday that well the EU is trying to</text>
  <text start="144.959" dur="5.941">shake them down they want an exit fee</text>
  <text start="148.68" dur="4.95">now we thought it was going to be around</text>
  <text start="150.9" dur="4.83">between 40 and 60 billion maybe up to</text>
  <text start="153.63" dur="4.8">100 billion they&amp;#39;re looking for a</text>
  <text start="155.73" dur="6.84">hundred and twenty billion euros to</text>

  <text start="163.29" dur="5.25">brexit s-- secretary David Davis said</text>
  <text start="166.83" dur="4.05">negotiations would be plunged into</text>
  <text start="168.54" dur="4.68">crisis from the start because the EU</text>
  <text start="170.88" dur="5.03">refused to discuss a trade deal until</text>
  <text start="173.22" dur="5.16">Britain agreed to pay the brexit Bill</text>
  <text start="175.91" dur="4.99">Davis warned that Britain would walk out</text>
  <text start="178.38" dur="4.71">of the talks unless the EU drops its the</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="4.32">man and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="183.09" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re saying that this is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="4.59">we are not going along with this</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="4.59">whatsoever Prime Minister Teresa May has</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="4.95">said that unless she gets the kind of</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="5.82">deal she wants from the EU well she will</text>
  <text start="194.76" dur="5.309">withdraw without any Accord there is a</text>
  <text start="197.58" dur="5.46">fight going on now between the deep</text>
  <text start="200.069" dur="6.241">state the central bank&amp;#39;s and the people</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="5.46">that are fighting against them because</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="5.7">the central bank&amp;#39;s the deep state</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="6.33">they still want control and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="5.91">going to try to keep control any way</text>
  <text start="214.83" dur="5.37">they possibly can they will not allow</text>
  <text start="217.92" dur="5.849">countries to leave they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="220.2" dur="6">force them to stay and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="5.701">surprised if this bill if they throw on</text>
  <text start="226.2" dur="5.52">other fees and bring it even higher to</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="5.579">make it seem like they can never leave</text>
  <text start="231.72" dur="4.829">now we&amp;#39;ll see the UK they might just say</text>
  <text start="235.049" dur="3.331">you know what we&amp;#39;re doing whatever we</text>
  <text start="236.549" dur="3.75">want we don&amp;#39;t care we&amp;#39;re just leaving</text>
  <text start="238.38" dur="4.859">but we will have to wait and see how</text>
  <text start="240.299" dur="5.481">this all plays out we see out in Greece</text>
  <text start="243.239" dur="6">well things are not going well their</text>
  <text start="245.78" dur="6.85">Greek debt relief deal well it fails in</text>
  <text start="249.239" dur="6.03">the last minutes and we see that Germany</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="4.169">the IMF they clash again and the big</text>
  <text start="255.269" dur="4.081">issue is what happens to the Greek</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="6.151">economy after 2018 now the Greek economy</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="4.98">it has never gotten better now of course</text>
  <text start="262.95" dur="2.969">they said they came out of a recession</text>
  <text start="264.33" dur="3.81">actually they&amp;#39;re back in the recession</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="3.991">they never really left all they did was</text>
  <text start="268.14" dur="2.85">manipulate a lot of the numbers to make</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="3.09">it look like they were doing a lot</text>
  <text start="270.99" dur="3.96">better when they were taking on more</text>
  <text start="273" dur="4.5">debt saying see it&amp;#39;s working look</text>
  <text start="274.95" dur="4.41">everyone everything is fine but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="3.87">not really the case everything was</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="3.21">falling apart and it&amp;#39;s still falling</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="2.79">apart actually they&amp;#39;re not even in</text>
  <text start="282.57" dur="4.5">recession they&amp;#39;re in a depression right</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="5.7">now here in the United States well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="287.07" dur="5.909">seeing a complete breakdown of the</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="5.88">entire system we&amp;#39;re looking at the soft</text>
  <text start="292.979" dur="4.681">data that is collapsing right now the</text>
  <text start="295.74" dur="5.01">Richmond feds manufacturing survey it</text>
  <text start="297.66" dur="4.44">has crashed by the second biggest drop</text>
  <text start="300.75" dur="5.22">ever in May</text>
  <text start="302.1" dur="6.66">new order volumes growth completely</text>
  <text start="305.97" dur="5.49">disappeared capacity utilization shrink</text>
  <text start="308.76" dur="5.779">dramatically order backlogs disappeared</text>
  <text start="311.46" dur="5.88">shipments plunged the average workweek</text>
  <text start="314.539" dur="5.75">tumbled and when we look at</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="4.419">manufacturing well the same thing is</text>
  <text start="320.289" dur="4.5">happening it is slumping to an</text>
  <text start="321.759" dur="5.15">eight-month low and when we look at</text>
  <text start="324.789" dur="5.37">everything right now we can see we are</text>
  <text start="326.909" dur="4.81">witnessing a total breakdown of the</text>
  <text start="330.159" dur="4.62">entire system</text>
  <text start="331.719" dur="7.59">look what what we are talking about now</text>
  <text start="334.779" dur="7.32">we&amp;#39;re talking about retail contracting</text>
  <text start="339.309" dur="4.86">stores closed and going bankrupt GDP at</text>
  <text start="342.099" dur="3.481">0.7 percent actually that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="344.169" dur="4.02">manipulated number it&amp;#39;s in the negative</text>
  <text start="345.58" dur="6.72">range we&amp;#39;re looking at corporate</text>
  <text start="348.189" dur="6.27">defaults student loan bubble the bond</text>
  <text start="352.3" dur="5.489">bubble the more the stock market bubble</text>
  <text start="354.459" dur="5.51">we&amp;#39;re looking at manufacturing declining</text>
  <text start="357.789" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re looking at corporations</text>
  <text start="359.969" dur="5.641">manufacturing saying listen we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="362.199" dur="5.52">bring jobs back here we can&amp;#39;t open</text>
  <text start="365.61" dur="5.339">manufacturing plants actually we have to</text>
  <text start="367.719" dur="6.78">let people go the situation right now is</text>
  <text start="370.949" dur="7.93">worse than ever the entire system is</text>
  <text start="374.499" dur="8.22">breaking down auto parts well that used</text>
  <text start="378.879" dur="5.64">to be the one sector where people were</text>
  <text start="382.719" dur="3.69">looking at saying you know what things</text>
  <text start="384.519" dur="5.67">look pretty darn good because the auto</text>
  <text start="386.409" dur="5.85">parts sector looks great and this sector</text>
  <text start="390.189" dur="6.78">has been a quality leader to the upside</text>
  <text start="392.259" dur="6.541">since 2009 and now it&amp;#39;s crashing new</text>
  <text start="396.969" dur="5.72">home sales well</text>
  <text start="398.8" dur="7.139">they plunged 11.4% month-on-month and</text>
  <text start="402.689" dur="5.82">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this</text>
  <text start="405.939" dur="4.56">is not really a surprise to any of us</text>
  <text start="408.509" dur="3.101">maybe to those people who are listening</text>
  <text start="410.499" dur="2.91">to the corporate media where they</text>
  <text start="411.61" dur="3.959">thought wow Real Estate&amp;#39;s really doing</text>
  <text start="413.409" dur="5.31">well I should sell my house now I should</text>
  <text start="415.569" dur="5.25">go out and buy a house now it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="418.719" dur="4.861">to fall apart and it&amp;#39;s accelerating</text>
  <text start="420.819" dur="7.62">right now and basically when we look at</text>
  <text start="423.58" dur="8.069">new home sales going back to 2011 they</text>
  <text start="428.439" dur="4.741">are unchanged they&amp;#39;re exactly where they</text>
  <text start="431.649" dur="4.41">were back then</text>
  <text start="433.18" dur="6.479">so we have a major major problem right</text>
  <text start="436.059" dur="6.66">now because all they did was inflate the</text>
  <text start="439.659" dur="6">bubbles and we had the ups and downs ups</text>
  <text start="442.719" dur="6.391">and downs of existing new homes and all</text>
  <text start="445.659" dur="6.09">of this has gone absolutely nowhere</text>
  <text start="449.11" dur="5.139">and if mortgage rates continually rise</text>
  <text start="451.749" dur="4.54">like we&amp;#39;re seeing them do right now</text>
  <text start="454.249" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s going to get worse and worse</text>
  <text start="456.289" dur="5.33">actually we&amp;#39;re seeing median new home</text>
  <text start="459.349" dur="4.56">prices they have fallen by 3.8 percent</text>
  <text start="461.619" dur="4.24">the whole thing starting to slow down</text>
  <text start="463.909" dur="5.25">the whole thing start and fall apart</text>
  <text start="465.859" dur="6.03">and the biggest driver of new home sales</text>
  <text start="469.159" dur="4.71">collapse was in the West which saw a</text>
  <text start="471.889" dur="4.26">twenty six point three percent collapse</text>
  <text start="473.869" dur="6.96">now this is the most since October of</text>
  <text start="476.149" dur="6.78">2010 now the question is with the Fed</text>
  <text start="480.829" dur="4.83">rate increases have they already</text>
  <text start="482.929" dur="5.91">triggered the collapse because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.659" dur="5.97">starting to feel like that now we know</text>
  <text start="488.839" dur="4.14">that Trump put forth his budget we</text>
  <text start="491.629" dur="3.81">already see that Congress are saying</text>
  <text start="492.979" dur="4.8">absolutely not this is just ridiculous</text>
  <text start="495.439" dur="4.59">week we can&amp;#39;t do anything like this and</text>
  <text start="497.779" dur="3.72">of course Congress they&amp;#39;re in the park</text>
  <text start="500.029" dur="3.87">at pockets of the central banks the</text>
  <text start="501.499" dur="4.53">corporations and they don&amp;#39;t see a</text>
  <text start="503.899" dur="3.6">problem because they&amp;#39;re just seeing the</text>
  <text start="506.029" dur="4.17">central bank will print some more money</text>
  <text start="507.499" dur="5.16">give it to us we don&amp;#39;t care and what is</text>
  <text start="510.199" dur="5.61">happening right now is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.659" dur="6.36">bankrupt I mean that&amp;#39;s what is happening</text>
  <text start="515.809" dur="5.16">here yes we can create more currency but</text>
  <text start="519.019" dur="4.62">it just makes it worse look at Greece</text>
  <text start="520.969" dur="4.98">they can take on more debt more debt as</text>
  <text start="523.639" dur="4.411">long as you know more people get hit</text>
  <text start="525.949" dur="3.771">with austerity they sell off a lot of</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="4.05">their property a lot of their assets</text>
  <text start="529.72" dur="5.559">well the same thing is going to happen</text>
  <text start="532.1" dur="5.159">here the country is bankrupt it cannot</text>
  <text start="535.279" dur="4.321">survive anymore the tax receipts coming</text>
  <text start="537.259" dur="3.031">to the government it is not enough</text>
  <text start="539.6" dur="3.779">anymore</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="5.31">to cover the interest payments and the</text>
  <text start="543.379" dur="3.781">interest payments are low can you</text>
  <text start="545.6" dur="3.27">imagine if they ticked up a little bit</text>
  <text start="547.16" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;d be a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="548.87" dur="5.55">now Treasury secretary Stephen minuchin</text>
  <text start="551.93" dur="4.56">said that trumps budget will achieve</text>
  <text start="554.42" dur="4.68">savings through the reforms that prevent</text>
  <text start="556.49" dur="4.23">taxpayer bailouts and reverse burdensome</text>
  <text start="559.1" dur="3.45">regulations that have been harmful to</text>
  <text start="560.72" dur="4.71">small businesses and American workers</text>
  <text start="562.55" dur="5.099">translation&amp;#39; taxpayer bailouts are</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="4.529">imminent especially now that the current</text>
  <text start="567.649" dur="6.721">economic cycle is the third longest of</text>
  <text start="569.959" dur="7.771">all time and a recession grows likelier</text>
  <text start="574.37" dur="6.209">with every passing day actually let me</text>
  <text start="577.73" dur="7.53">correct that the depression grows</text>
  <text start="580.579" dur="7.741">likelier with every passing day now</text>
  <text start="585.26" dur="6.33">we can see that Trump is preparing the</text>
  <text start="588.32" dur="6.15">economy for a collapse because all of</text>
  <text start="591.59" dur="4.22">this will not be able to exist a lot of</text>
  <text start="594.47" dur="3.51">its going to completely disappear</text>
  <text start="595.81" dur="5.65">actually most of its going to disappear</text>
  <text start="597.98" dur="6.48">and when we look at the actual data of</text>
  <text start="601.46" dur="5.25">what&amp;#39;s been going on in the economy we</text>
  <text start="604.46" dur="6.72">can see that we have been in a</text>
  <text start="606.71" dur="7.44">depression all along yes I know the Fed</text>
  <text start="611.18" dur="5.97">the US government they&amp;#39;re not mentioning</text>
  <text start="614.15" dur="5.22">this at all because like I said before</text>
  <text start="617.15" dur="5.1">they don&amp;#39;t mention it until we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="619.37" dur="5.1">actually in it and people notice it</text>
  <text start="622.25" dur="5.46">right now no one&amp;#39;s noticing it because</text>
  <text start="624.47" dur="6.66">the Federal Reserve the US government</text>
  <text start="627.71" dur="4.98">they know how to play the game they</text>
  <text start="631.13" dur="3.51">realize if we create all these</text>
  <text start="632.69" dur="5.13">entitlement programs we can keep a lot</text>
  <text start="634.64" dur="6.45">of people quiet and we can keep a lot of</text>
  <text start="637.82" dur="5.64">people semi happy where they won&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="641.09" dur="4.62">anything because they&amp;#39;re living off the</text>
  <text start="643.46" dur="5.46">government now remember the system is</text>
  <text start="645.71" dur="5.22">designed not to work for the people the</text>
  <text start="648.92" dur="3.75">system is designed to work for the</text>
  <text start="650.93" dur="3.84">central bankers to work for the</text>
  <text start="652.67" dur="6.6">government officials the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.77" dur="8.25">the the elite it is not designed to be a</text>
  <text start="659.27" dur="6.48">system that makes people prosper that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="663.02" dur="5.01">why we see a huge lower class the middle</text>
  <text start="665.75" dur="4.23">class is completely gone and this is why</text>
  <text start="668.03" dur="3.78">everything is flowing up to the 1% but</text>
  <text start="669.98" dur="5.07">when we look at the economy right now</text>
  <text start="671.81" dur="6.57">and we look at it over the last ten</text>
  <text start="675.05" dur="5.19">years you know it&amp;#39;s exactly equal to the</text>
  <text start="678.38" dur="6.18">average rate that the US economy grew</text>
  <text start="680.24" dur="7.47">during the 30s now during the 30s that</text>
  <text start="684.56" dur="6.12">was during the Great Depression and if</text>
  <text start="687.71" dur="6.18">we look they had wild swings like in</text>
  <text start="690.68" dur="6.09">1930 GDP was down negative 8.5% and</text>
  <text start="693.89" dur="4.23">remember these are unmanipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="696.77" dur="2.82">back then they might have been</text>
  <text start="698.12" dur="4.71">manipulated a little bit but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="699.59" dur="5.27">pretty much they&amp;#39;re pretty good 1931</text>
  <text start="702.83" dur="4.5">negative six point four percent and</text>
  <text start="704.86" dur="5.47">there&amp;#39;s a lot of negatives and positives</text>
  <text start="707.33" dur="6">going throughout these years and if we</text>
  <text start="710.33" dur="5.85">take the average of these GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="713.33" dur="5.04">over the 10 years the growth of the</text>
  <text start="716.18" dur="3">economy was at one point three three</text>
  <text start="718.37" dur="5.76">percent</text>
  <text start="719.18" dur="6.21">now if we go from 2007 to 2016 and we</text>
  <text start="724.13" dur="2.82">look at the GDP numbers that we have</text>
  <text start="725.39" dur="5.31">there and these are manipulated remember</text>
  <text start="726.95" dur="8.43">by 2007 was 1.8 2008 was negative point</text>
  <text start="730.7" dur="10.26">3 mm I was negative 2.8 and so on we get</text>
  <text start="735.38" dur="9.21">the same exact average 1.3 3 percent</text>
  <text start="740.96" dur="7.05">what does that tell us tells us we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="744.59" dur="5.91">a depression right now but a lot of it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="748.01" dur="4.74">covered up there pumping up the stock</text>
  <text start="750.5" dur="5.01">market a lot of people are living off</text>
  <text start="752.75" dur="5.13">the government the number of jobs that</text>
  <text start="755.51" dur="5.67">were created by the government was to</text>
  <text start="757.88" dur="5.22">keep people quiet and to keep the system</text>
  <text start="761.18" dur="4.68">operational because the government</text>
  <text start="763.1" dur="5.16">continually has to borrow money to pay</text>
  <text start="765.86" dur="5.04">for these millions and millions of</text>
  <text start="768.26" dur="5.37">people and when the system breaks down</text>
  <text start="770.9" dur="5.64">these people are going to be out of a</text>
  <text start="773.63" dur="5.7">job there are no jobs in the private</text>
  <text start="776.54" dur="5.85">sector for them and this is millions of</text>
  <text start="779.33" dur="7.11">people it is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="782.39" dur="5.43">disaster Trump knows this and for all</text>
  <text start="786.44" dur="2.78">those people who thought that Trump was</text>
  <text start="787.82" dur="5.04">just going to come into the office and</text>
  <text start="789.22" dur="7.18">go in there and change everything by</text>
  <text start="792.86" dur="5.13">snapping his fingers saying ok listen we</text>
  <text start="796.4" dur="3.93">know this is manipulated we know this</text>
  <text start="797.99" dur="3.48">gold and silver markets manipulated</text>
  <text start="800.33" dur="2.25">we&amp;#39;re going to have to change these</text>
  <text start="801.47" dur="3.99">rules we can have to get rid of these</text>
  <text start="802.58" dur="4.89">people no way first of all the deep</text>
  <text start="805.46" dur="4.23">state is so intertwined in the</text>
  <text start="807.47" dur="4.47">government completely impossible to play</text>
  <text start="809.69" dur="4.98">that type of game second of all the deep</text>
  <text start="811.94" dur="4.86">state they just don&amp;#39;t leave just because</text>
  <text start="814.67" dur="4.92">you tell them they fight back and</text>
  <text start="816.8" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re dirty and I believe that Trump</text>
  <text start="819.59" dur="2.61">in the beginning thought he&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="820.7" dur="3.78">to bargain with all these individuals</text>
  <text start="822.2" dur="4.17">and may work out deals if you give me</text>
  <text start="824.48" dur="3.69">this I&amp;#39;ll give you that but it looks</text>
  <text start="826.37" dur="5.85">like that&amp;#39;s not happening right now</text>
  <text start="828.17" dur="4.53">so his strategy right now is to go along</text>
  <text start="832.22" dur="2.37">with them</text>
  <text start="832.7" dur="4.35">and that&amp;#39;s what it seems too many people</text>
  <text start="834.59" dur="4.77">many people believe that he is going</text>
  <text start="837.05" dur="4.62">along with them he&amp;#39;s part of the system</text>
  <text start="839.36" dur="4.77">but we can see there&amp;#39;s little things</text>
  <text start="841.67" dur="6.27">that he&amp;#39;s doing right now where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="844.13" dur="7.35">looking at all the land that bushes that</text>
  <text start="847.94" dur="4.47">the Clintons that Obama all set aside</text>
  <text start="851.48" dur="4.14">he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="852.41" dur="5.88">looking at what why they did this what</text>
  <text start="855.62" dur="5.159">is there is there or is there gold is</text>
  <text start="858.29" dur="4.65">there silver what natural resources are</text>
  <text start="860.779" dur="4.35">there because once the system comes down</text>
  <text start="862.94" dur="5.129">we&amp;#39;re going to have to depend on</text>
  <text start="865.129" dur="7.08">ourselves because when the system breaks</text>
  <text start="868.069" dur="7.921">down we&amp;#39;re not getting oil from Saudi</text>
  <text start="872.209" dur="5.851">Arabia from the Middle Eastern countries</text>
  <text start="875.99" dur="4.349">it&amp;#39;s not going to happen remember what</text>
  <text start="878.06" dur="4.949">happened back in nineteen seventy where</text>
  <text start="880.339" dur="5.73">we were transitioning to this new petro</text>
  <text start="883.009" dur="5.101">dollar system well oil wasn&amp;#39;t flowing</text>
  <text start="886.069" dur="4.95">into this country it was hard to get</text>
  <text start="888.11" dur="5.64">when you try to go fill up your car well</text>
  <text start="891.019" dur="5.041">Trump realizes that this is going to</text>
  <text start="893.75" dur="4.23">happen once again but this time we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="896.06" dur="4.019">not transitioning to a petro dollar</text>
  <text start="897.98" dur="4.289">system this time the system is crashing</text>
  <text start="900.079" dur="3.87">and the people here in the United States</text>
  <text start="902.269" dur="4.021">what we&amp;#39;re going to have to Penn we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="903.949" dur="5.101">going to have to depend on ourselves to</text>
  <text start="906.29" dur="4.799">get by and this is why he&amp;#39;s looking at</text>
  <text start="909.05" dur="6.209">all these different areas and right now</text>
  <text start="911.089" dur="7.74">Trump is looking at Alaska the National</text>
  <text start="915.259" dur="6.27">Wildlife Refuge to drill for oil there</text>
  <text start="918.829" dur="4.86">now before we start drilling and</text>
  <text start="921.529" dur="6.68">everything like that he needs to start</text>
  <text start="923.689" dur="8.551">bringing cash into the u.s. and set up</text>
  <text start="928.209" dur="5.471">supplies to other areas so what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="932.24" dur="3.149">looking at and he understands that</text>
  <text start="933.68" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s oil in this country that we can</text>
  <text start="935.389" dur="5.94">tamp and there&amp;#39;s a huge Strategic</text>
  <text start="938.93" dur="4.44">Petroleum Reserve in this country and</text>
  <text start="941.329" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re located in Louisiana and Texas</text>
  <text start="943.37" dur="4.079">there&amp;#39;s six hundred eighty eight million</text>
  <text start="945.019" dur="5.94">barrels of and this was started back in</text>
  <text start="947.449" dur="5.19">1975 after oil supplies were interrupted</text>
  <text start="950.959" dur="3.93">remember when we were going onto the</text>
  <text start="952.639" dur="5.01">petro dollar system and we couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="954.889" dur="4.14">bring the oil into this country of</text>
  <text start="957.649" dur="3.36">course they were out there saying there</text>
  <text start="959.029" dur="4.68">were shortages it wasn&amp;#39;t enough oil in</text>
  <text start="961.009" dur="6.69">the world and I remember them lowering</text>
  <text start="963.709" dur="8.55">the speed limit down to 55 so everyone</text>
  <text start="967.699" dur="6.12">could serve gasoline and once the system</text>
  <text start="972.259" dur="3.51">was laid out and everything was up and</text>
  <text start="973.819" dur="4.14">running oil started to flow back into</text>
  <text start="975.769" dur="5.07">this country now according to Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="977.959" dur="6.87">plan the reserves will start to be sold</text>
  <text start="980.839" dur="5.211">from October 2018 at the same time the</text>
  <text start="984.829" dur="4.57">US would boost its</text>
  <text start="986.05" dur="6.39">oil production here in the United States</text>
  <text start="989.399" dur="6.25">because we have to be self-reliant</text>
  <text start="992.44" dur="6.839">remember he said going forward trade is</text>
  <text start="995.649" dur="5.281">going to be very important for a time</text>
  <text start="999.279" dur="3.75">being just like when we were coming on</text>
  <text start="1000.93" dur="4.11">the system onto the system in the 70s</text>
  <text start="1003.029" dur="4.711">when we couldn&amp;#39;t get oil in we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="1005.04" dur="4.38">off the system now and we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1007.74" dur="3.029">trade really set up with all these</text>
  <text start="1009.42" dur="2.82">countries now all these countries are</text>
  <text start="1010.769" dur="3.81">going to have their own problems and</text>
  <text start="1012.24" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re not going to get the products from</text>
  <text start="1014.579" dur="3.781">China we&amp;#39;re not going to get the oil</text>
  <text start="1016.35" dur="4.44">from other countries it&amp;#39;s all going to</text>
  <text start="1018.36" dur="4.14">come to a screeching halt and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1020.79" dur="3.899">we need to make sure that we are</text>
  <text start="1022.5" dur="3.99">prepared for what is coming now does</text>
  <text start="1024.689" dur="3.061">this mean that all these plans are just</text>
  <text start="1026.49" dur="4.05">going to work out and everything&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1027.75" dur="6.9">to be fine now he&amp;#39;s trying to push this</text>
  <text start="1030.54" dur="4.98">he&amp;#39;s trying to maneuver away to make it</text>
  <text start="1034.65" dur="3.299">all happen</text>
  <text start="1035.52" dur="6.21">but the question is will it happen in</text>
  <text start="1037.949" dur="5.431">time in time for the collapse I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1041.73" dur="3.599">know because it looks like things are</text>
  <text start="1043.38" dur="3.809">breaking apart very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="1045.329" dur="4.35">this is why you have to depend on</text>
  <text start="1047.189" dur="4.951">yourself this is why you can&amp;#39;t depend on</text>
  <text start="1049.679" dur="5.281">the government because when things fall</text>
  <text start="1052.14" dur="3.6">apart well you won&amp;#39;t be able to look at</text>
  <text start="1054.96" dur="3.09">the government because the government</text>
  <text start="1055.74" dur="4.71">will be reeling and many of those</text>
  <text start="1058.05" dur="4.56">individuals will be out of a job and the</text>
  <text start="1060.45" dur="5.28">government will be broke and you will</text>
  <text start="1062.61" dur="6.54">have to look inward and say okay we have</text>
  <text start="1065.73" dur="5.07">food we have fuel we have the ability to</text>
  <text start="1069.15" dur="5.22">sustain our lives</text>
  <text start="1070.8" dur="5.61">that&amp;#39;s what prepping is all about just</text>
  <text start="1074.37" dur="4.89">like the government is trying to prepare</text>
  <text start="1076.41" dur="4.62">right now for a catastrophe now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1079.26" dur="3.99">been preparing for a very long time they</text>
  <text start="1081.03" dur="5.19">understand the systems coming down you</text>
