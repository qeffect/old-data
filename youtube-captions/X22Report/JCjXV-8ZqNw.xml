  <text start="77.84" dur="5.55">have an online presence and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="80.479" dur="5.041">just been getting hit like crazy and</text>
  <text start="83.39" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of stores shut down I</text>

  <text start="113.929" dur="5.55">pretty much going into bankruptcy they</text>
  <text start="116.36" dur="5.55">have a lot of debt and they&amp;#39;re blaming</text>
  <text start="119.479" dur="4.65">this on everyone buying food online</text>
  <text start="121.91" dur="5.25">which is absolutely ridiculous because</text>
  <text start="124.129" dur="4.921">online food right now is not that big</text>
  <text start="127.16" dur="3.629">and we could see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="129.05" dur="5.04">having a huge amount of problems now</text>
  <text start="130.789" dur="5.071">what we see here is that there are many</text>
  <text start="134.09" dur="3.63">many other stores that are in trouble I</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="3.66">mean Sam&amp;#39;s Club they&amp;#39;re closing stories</text>
  <text start="137.72" dur="3.87">towards the RUS we know and there are</text>

  <text start="141.59" dur="3.3">stores that are being closed down and</text>
  <text start="143.06" dur="4.319">shut down for good a lot of stores are</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="4.77">going to be non-existent as we move</text>
  <text start="147.379" dur="3.991">forward and this is going to continue</text>
  <text start="149.66" dur="4.32">because what&amp;#39;s happening here is that</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="5.64">the people they are having a very</text>
  <text start="153.98" dur="7.05">difficult time using their disposable</text>
  <text start="157.01" dur="5.46">income because they don&amp;#39;t have any what</text>
  <text start="161.03" dur="3.36">that what&amp;#39;s happening right now is</text>
  <text start="162.47" dur="3.599">they&amp;#39;re losing jobs as we can see over a</text>
  <text start="164.39" dur="5.519">hundred thousand something jobs have</text>
  <text start="166.069" dur="7.101">been lost in retail many full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="169.909" dur="6.901">have been lost nothing has been repaired</text>
  <text start="173.17" dur="6.55">nothing has been recovered the job</text>
  <text start="176.81" dur="4.8">situation the economy it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="179.72" dur="3.51">deteriorating and I know they keep</text>
  <text start="181.61" dur="3.209">everyone busy with their manipulated</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="3.15">numbers on how the stock market&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="184.819" dur="2.821">and how great everything is</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="2.91">when we start to look at everything we</text>
  <text start="187.64" dur="3.36">could see that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="189.29" dur="2.61">falling apart when we look at housing</text>
  <text start="191" dur="2.75">yes</text>
  <text start="191.9" dur="4.53">prices are going up that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="193.75" dur="4.48">housing is doing well it means they</text>
  <text start="196.43" dur="3.6">pumped up the bubble in 20 different</text>
  <text start="198.23" dur="3.87">cities to make you think housing is</text>
  <text start="200.03" dur="2.49">doing well in many parts of the country</text>
  <text start="202.1" dur="2.64">right now</text>
  <text start="202.52" dur="4.68">housing is declining traffic is</text>
  <text start="204.74" dur="4.05">declining and we can see right now there</text>
  <text start="207.2" dur="4.05">are certain things the central bankers</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="4.8">just can&amp;#39;t do they can create debt they</text>
  <text start="211.25" dur="4.59">can create bubbles they can give loans</text>
  <text start="213.59" dur="5">to people to put them into further debt</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="5.4">what they can&amp;#39;t get people to do is</text>
  <text start="218.59" dur="4.18">spend their money and get jobs</text>
  <text start="221.24" dur="2.49">that&amp;#39;s the one thing they can do and</text>
  <text start="222.77" dur="3.69">this is why they were talking about</text>
  <text start="223.73" dur="4.77">universal basic income because what they</text>
  <text start="226.46" dur="5.46">wanted was they wanted more of these</text>
  <text start="228.5" dur="5.4">funds to be put into the economy but</text>
  <text start="231.92" dur="4.08">when people don&amp;#39;t have it they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="4.86">it when people can&amp;#39;t do it that means</text>
  <text start="236" dur="5.16">the economy falls apart when the economy</text>
  <text start="238.76" dur="5.04">falls apart it&amp;#39;s blamed on the central</text>
  <text start="241.16" dur="5.9">bankers because they couldn&amp;#39;t keep the</text>
  <text start="243.8" dur="5.97">system running it&amp;#39;s not their controlled</text>
  <text start="247.06" dur="4.6">take down of the economy it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="249.77" dur="4.62">economy just breaking down on its own</text>
  <text start="251.66" dur="6.03">and they try to keep us in this illusion</text>
  <text start="254.39" dur="4.8">as long as possible until they bring it</text>
  <text start="257.69" dur="3.99">down and they can set the blame</text>
  <text start="259.19" dur="4.14">someplace else we see that housing</text>
  <text start="261.68" dur="3.44">starts well they jumped a little bit</text>
  <text start="263.33" dur="4.53">which means absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="265.12" dur="5.08">pending sales and all this because what</text>
  <text start="267.86" dur="4.14">happens normally later on is that all of</text>
  <text start="270.2" dur="3.72">this completely falls apart later on in</text>
  <text start="272" dur="4.17">the housing starts fall the pending</text>
  <text start="273.92" dur="4.44">sales you know go away and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.17" dur="5.76">really nothing there what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="5.94">is that rents after the crisis of 2008</text>
  <text start="281.93" dur="5.7">skyrocketed because a lot of people lost</text>
  <text start="284.3" dur="4.77">their homes they went to go rent and the</text>
  <text start="287.63" dur="3.57">people who are renting these homes they</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="4.47">were raising the rents at this time</text>
  <text start="291.2" dur="4.71">because there was a lot of demand what</text>
  <text start="293.54" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that there are</text>
  <text start="295.91" dur="7.32">many renters that are paying more than</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="6.93">30% of their income for the rental units</text>
  <text start="303.23" dur="6.9">which means they have less disposable</text>
  <text start="305.21" dur="7.41">income to spend out in retail and this</text>
  <text start="310.13" dur="5.13">is taking its toll right now and the</text>
  <text start="312.62" dur="4.83">rental units they have been over built</text>
  <text start="315.26" dur="4.71">and it looks like we&amp;#39;re heading down the</text>
  <text start="317.45" dur="4.68">same path as we had with</text>
  <text start="319.97" dur="3.66">single-family homes where they kept</text>
  <text start="322.13" dur="3.81">building thinking to be more and more</text>
  <text start="323.63" dur="6.18">renters and what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="325.94" dur="6.69">is that they&amp;#39;re over built we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.81" dur="5.37">approaching another crisis and here we</text>
  <text start="332.63" dur="4.59">are once again because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="335.18" dur="4.56">right now is single family homes</text>
  <text start="337.22" dur="5.13">existing home sales new construction</text>
  <text start="339.74" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re all starting to decline we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="342.35" dur="3.63">also seeing prices they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="344.27" dur="3.81">come down in many different areas yes</text>
  <text start="345.98" dur="4.35">the 20 cities they can keep the prices</text>
  <text start="348.08" dur="3.99">moving up and up and up until the very</text>
  <text start="350.33" dur="4.2">very end until the bubbles pop up we can</text>
  <text start="352.07" dur="5.16">see the bubbles are popping in Canada</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="5.82">Australia throughout Europe and the</text>
  <text start="357.23" dur="5.16">housing market is starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="360.35" dur="5.82">and this is going to accelerate over</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="5.7">time now I know Trump put forth his tax</text>
  <text start="366.17" dur="4.59">plan where it also allows companies to</text>
  <text start="368.09" dur="6.3">bring back funds into this country and</text>
  <text start="370.76" dur="6.99">this is a temporary plan to keep the</text>
  <text start="374.39" dur="7.17">system alive a little bit longer so we</text>
  <text start="377.75" dur="5.46">can put forth the transition and what</text>
  <text start="381.56" dur="5.7">this is going to do it&amp;#39;s going to bring</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="6.6">and give corporations funds the problem</text>
  <text start="387.26" dur="4.08">is is that these corporations they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="389.81" dur="3.6">not going to be investing in</text>
  <text start="391.34" dur="3.99">infrastructure they&amp;#39;re not going to take</text>
  <text start="393.41" dur="4.14">these funds and invest in the country</text>
  <text start="395.33" dur="5.16">but they&amp;#39;re actually going to do is</text>
  <text start="397.55" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re going to use these funds to buy</text>
  <text start="400.49" dur="5.28">back their shares they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="403.76" dur="4.29">this all along it has been pumping the</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="3.78">stock market up and it looks like this</text>
  <text start="408.05" dur="3.869">is exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="5.34">doing right now because when we take a</text>
  <text start="411.919" dur="5.551">look at this we can see right now since</text>
  <text start="414.89" dur="4.5">the CEMP since December SP 500 firms</text>
  <text start="417.47" dur="4.35">have announced buybacks totaling a</text>
  <text start="419.39" dur="4.17">hundred and seventy-one billion year to</text>
  <text start="421.82" dur="5.849">date announcements of sixty seven</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="7.2">billion represent a 22% increase versus</text>
  <text start="427.669" dur="5.911">the same period in 2017 the buyback</text>
  <text start="430.76" dur="4.89">window has reopened and firms are taking</text>
  <text start="433.58" dur="5.46">advantage of the recent correction and</text>
  <text start="435.65" dur="5.55">we can see right now the 171 billion</text>
  <text start="439.04" dur="5.43">year to date stock buyback announcement</text>
  <text start="441.2" dur="6.18">is the most ever for this early in the</text>
  <text start="444.47" dur="5.61">year in fact it is more than double the</text>
  <text start="447.38" dur="5.4">prior ten-year average of 77 billion</text>
  <text start="450.08" dur="3.75">year to date buyback announcements now</text>
  <text start="452.78" dur="4.229">putting the number</text>
  <text start="453.83" dur="5.399">in context according to JPMorgan the</text>
  <text start="457.009" dur="4.891">amount of announced buybacks just in the</text>
  <text start="459.229" dur="6.87">first six weeks of 2018 is already</text>
  <text start="461.9" dur="6">greater than all of 2009 which of course</text>
  <text start="466.099" dur="5.25">is when companies should have been</text>
  <text start="467.9" dur="6.299">splurging on stock repurchases finally</text>
  <text start="471.349" dur="7.171">in addition to what we first pointed out</text>
  <text start="474.199" dur="7.261">over there two years ago all the net</text>
  <text start="478.52" dur="8.34">debt issuance in the 21st century has</text>
  <text start="481.46" dur="8.25">been used to pay for stock buybacks what</text>
  <text start="486.86" dur="5.429">we&amp;#39;re looking at right now is a move to</text>
  <text start="489.71" dur="6.199">prop the system up a little longer</text>
  <text start="492.289" dur="5.791">they&amp;#39;re not spending this these funds on</text>
  <text start="495.909" dur="4.421">anything actually they&amp;#39;re just doing it</text>
  <text start="498.08" dur="4.32">to pump it back into the stock market to</text>
  <text start="500.33" dur="4.399">pump it back up the central banks right</text>
  <text start="502.4" dur="5.75">now are pumping up the stock market and</text>
  <text start="504.729" dur="6.551">we can see right now this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="508.15" dur="5.679">completely manipulated it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="511.28" dur="5.79">help in the way that everyone thinks</text>
  <text start="513.829" dur="7.83">remember this system that we are in</text>
  <text start="517.07" dur="6.99">right now is dead the the system is</text>
  <text start="521.659" dur="6.061">bankrupt think about a corporation who</text>
  <text start="524.06" dur="6.3">has a huge amount of debt that does not</text>
  <text start="527.72" dur="4.71">have enough revenue coming in is on the</text>
  <text start="530.36" dur="4.2">verge of declaring bankruptcy what do</text>
  <text start="532.43" dur="4.62">they normally do they go out and they</text>
  <text start="534.56" dur="4.68">spend more why because they know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.05" dur="4.92">going to be written off later on it</text>
  <text start="539.24" dur="5.4">makes no difference to them the same</text>
