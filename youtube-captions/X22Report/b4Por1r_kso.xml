  <text start="75.229" dur="5.071">watching different bubbles around the</text>
  <text start="77.57" dur="5.04">world where they reached all-time highs</text>
  <text start="80.3" dur="4.29">and now they&amp;#39;re starting to pop we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="82.61" dur="4.11">seeing in the UK we&amp;#39;re seeing it in</text>
  <text start="84.59" dur="4.169">Canada we&amp;#39;re even seeing it here in the</text>
  <text start="86.72" dur="4.679">United States or even seeing it in</text>
  <text start="88.759" dur="7.351">Australia but now we&amp;#39;re seeing it in</text>
  <text start="91.399" dur="8.851">Sweden Sweden&amp;#39;s property bubble most</text>
  <text start="96.11" dur="5.97">likely is the world&amp;#39;s biggest and it</text>
  <text start="100.25" dur="3.479">really doesn&amp;#39;t get that much coverage in</text>
  <text start="102.08" dur="2.87">the mainstream media now we know the</text>
  <text start="103.729" dur="4.741">mainstream media the corporate media</text>
  <text start="104.95" dur="5.86">they like to leave out certain important</text>
  <text start="108.47" dur="4.71">aspects of what is going on around the</text>
  <text start="110.81" dur="4.919">world if they feel that if they leave it</text>
  <text start="113.18" dur="4.56">out then they&amp;#39;re not really lying about</text>
  <text start="115.729" dur="4.621">it they&amp;#39;re not really handing out fake</text>
  <text start="117.74" dur="6.27">news they just didn&amp;#39;t report on it and</text>
  <text start="120.35" dur="7.769">what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that this</text>
  <text start="124.01" dur="6.96">bubble well it&amp;#39;s not new in March 2016</text>
  <text start="128.119" dur="4.321">Moody&amp;#39;s issued a very explicit warning</text>
  <text start="130.97" dur="3.86">that Sweden&amp;#39;s negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="132.44" dur="4.62">were propagating an unsustainable</text>
  <text start="134.83" dur="4.54">housing bubble now this is very</text>
  <text start="137.06" dur="4.32">interesting because we are seeing the</text>
  <text start="139.37" dur="4.7">same type of housing bubbles occur in</text>
  <text start="141.38" dur="5.82">the UK Australia throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="144.07" dur="6.4">singing in Canada the United States and</text>
  <text start="147.2" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s happening everywhere and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="150.47" dur="5.64">seeing right now is that this ultra</text>
  <text start="153.26" dur="6">loose monetary policy well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="156.11" dur="6.57">created all these bubbles and this is</text>
  <text start="159.26" dur="5.52">what central banks do and this asset</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="4.86">bubble this housing acid bubble that</text>
  <text start="164.78" dur="4.679">they created it is unsustainable and</text>
  <text start="167.54" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s getting bigger and bigger and</text>
  <text start="169.459" dur="6.481">bigger now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="170.93" dur="6.69">this is that back in 1995 they create</text>
  <text start="175.94" dur="3.99">they created a department called the</text>
  <text start="177.62" dur="4.019">price stability department where they</text>
  <text start="179.93" dur="6.84">were gonna control housing prices and</text>
  <text start="181.639" dur="9.481">since 1995 the housing prices index</text>
  <text start="186.77" dur="6.57">from like 75 all the way up to 450 and</text>
  <text start="191.12" dur="6.48">the line is just straight up</text>
  <text start="193.34" dur="7.92">it&amp;#39;s basically a housing bubble type of</text>
  <text start="197.6" dur="6.57">graph and it really took off yes right</text>
  <text start="201.26" dur="4.38">after the housing crisis of 2008 now it</text>
  <text start="204.17" dur="4.35">started to move up very very quickly</text>
  <text start="205.64" dur="5.94">from 1995 up to 2008 but right after</text>
  <text start="208.52" dur="5.69">2008 boom it just shot straight up and</text>
  <text start="211.58" dur="5.49">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="214.21" dur="6.01">Swedes are turning less optimistic on</text>
  <text start="217.07" dur="5.52">the housing market and after figures</text>
  <text start="220.22" dur="5.1">suggest that a long run of price rises</text>
  <text start="222.59" dur="4.61">may be coming to an end and the</text>
  <text start="225.32" dur="5.25">authorities there the financial</text>
  <text start="227.2" dur="5.98">institutions there they are very worried</text>
  <text start="230.57" dur="4.98">about this and this is not the only</text>
  <text start="233.18" dur="3.96">country that this is happening in we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.55" dur="3.63">seeing it happen in many different</text>
  <text start="237.14" dur="4.02">countries here in the United States</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re telling us that the unemployment</text>
  <text start="241.16" dur="5.1">rate is like 4.1 percent and if this is</text>
  <text start="244.04" dur="4.71">true why is everything contracting will</text>
  <text start="246.26" dur="5.04">retail is contracting right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="4.26">trying to you know convince us and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="251.3" dur="3.78">talk about this in a minute that retail</text>
  <text start="253.01" dur="3.78">is doing fine and we&amp;#39;re seeing an</text>
  <text start="255.08" dur="4.2">improvement but we&amp;#39;ll get into those</text>
  <text start="256.79" dur="5.7">numbers in just a bit but think about</text>
  <text start="259.28" dur="5.43">this for a second as unemployment came</text>
  <text start="262.49" dur="3.9">down and they&amp;#39;re telling us that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="264.71" dur="5.58">at full employment and everyone has a</text>
  <text start="266.39" dur="6.78">job and everything is great why have the</text>
  <text start="270.29" dur="4.92">real average hourly earnings decline for</text>
  <text start="273.17" dur="7.41">the three for three straight months in a</text>
  <text start="275.21" dur="9.42">row and since the financial crisis wages</text>
  <text start="280.58" dur="5.91">have declined since now when we saw more</text>
  <text start="284.63" dur="4.65">and more individuals get jobs this is</text>
  <text start="286.49" dur="7.28">going back to like 295 all the way up to</text>
  <text start="289.28" dur="8.46">2007 more people were getting jobs and</text>
  <text start="293.77" dur="7">people had jobs and to entice people to</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="4.98">move over to these other jobs well they</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="4.29">had to pay them more because there was</text>
  <text start="302.72" dur="4.5">no one out there right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="5.19">telling us that they can&amp;#39;t find people</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="7.8">to fill these jobs we should see wages</text>
  <text start="310.25" dur="8.61">increasing not decreasing and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="315.02" dur="7.919">see that we see the opposite happening</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="5.7">and if everyone has a job and the</text>
  <text start="322.939" dur="3.841">unemployment rate is at 4.1 percent I</text>
  <text start="324.56" dur="4.229">don&amp;#39;t care if they give us 2% we know</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="4.74">this is a manipulated number we already</text>
  <text start="328.789" dur="5.581">talked about how this is done we would</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="5.34">see retail expanding we would see a one</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="4.919">to one ratio that the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="336.86" dur="5.309">sales are moving to the online sales and</text>
  <text start="339.289" dur="6.361">they would say holy crap the entire</text>
  <text start="342.169" dur="6.481">retail market it is on fire we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="345.65" dur="4.769">seeing that what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="348.65" dur="4.319">brick-and-mortar stores implode on</text>
  <text start="350.419" dur="5.97">themselves and it&amp;#39;s not translating to</text>
  <text start="352.969" dur="6.271">the online sales area a little bit if it</text>
  <text start="356.389" dur="5.28">is but not much now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="359.24" dur="4.709">convince us that retail is doing better</text>
  <text start="361.669" dur="4.74">now September they revised the numbers</text>
  <text start="363.949" dur="4.981">the retail numbers came at 1.6 they</text>
  <text start="366.409" dur="3.78">pushed them up to 1.9 percent and now</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="2.959">they&amp;#39;re telling us that retail is</text>
  <text start="370.189" dur="4.561">growing by four point six percent</text>
  <text start="371.889" dur="6.52">remember how the government gets these</text>
  <text start="374.75" dur="6.36">numbers these are not numbers directly</text>
  <text start="378.409" dur="4.41">from the retailers they make guesses and</text>
  <text start="381.11" dur="4.369">if they don&amp;#39;t like what the retailers</text>
  <text start="382.819" dur="7.56">actually give them they change them and</text>
  <text start="385.479" dur="7.481">think about this even further we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="390.379" dur="5.581">having store after store declare</text>
  <text start="392.96" dur="7.019">bankruptcy we&amp;#39;re having stores closed</text>
  <text start="395.96" dur="6.269">down RadioShack gone JC Penney&amp;#39;s closing</text>

  <text start="405.56" dur="4.319">stores are closing we&amp;#39;re not seeing a</text>
  <text start="408.08" dur="4.649">one to one ratio where all the sales are</text>
  <text start="409.879" dur="10.081">now moving to online they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="412.729" dur="11.91">that since what 2015 - right now retail</text>
  <text start="419.96" dur="9.239">sales are doing better than ever does</text>
  <text start="424.639" dur="6.601">that make any sense no it doesn&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="429.199" dur="6.18">is fake phony and false when a store</text>
  <text start="431.24" dur="5.88">closes down and they are no longer</text>
  <text start="435.379" dur="5.34">making sales and they close down let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="437.12" dur="5.819">say in March what the government does is</text>
  <text start="440.719" dur="4.521">they take these numbers and they spread</text>
  <text start="442.939" dur="4.681">them out over the whole entire year and</text>
  <text start="445.24" dur="5.859">they make it seem like that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="447.62" dur="5.609">still making sales and remember gas</text>
  <text start="451.099" dur="4.54">sales are included but the</text>
  <text start="453.229" dur="4.391">automobile sales are included with this</text>
  <text start="455.639" dur="4.261">and people aren&amp;#39;t using their own money</text>
  <text start="457.62" dur="4.289">to purchase automobiles they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="459.9" dur="4.139">out loans and we know what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="461.909" dur="4.56">with the audible meal market well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="464.039" dur="3.961">starting to stall and we know how they</text>
  <text start="466.469" dur="3.75">get the sales from automobiles</text>
  <text start="468" dur="5.879">once they channel stuff into the Lots</text>
  <text start="470.219" dur="6.091">that is called a sale not when the</text>
  <text start="473.879" dur="4.801">person purchased the automobile when the</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="5.129">dealership receives the automobile on</text>
  <text start="478.68" dur="8.82">the lot that is a sale strip all that</text>
  <text start="481.439" dur="9.53">out strip out autos strip out fuel we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="6.3">seeing sales were only up around 0.1% in</text>
  <text start="490.969" dur="6.76">the month which completely missed</text>
  <text start="493.8" dur="7.709">expectations and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here</text>
  <text start="497.729" dur="6.96">is all of this is manipulated to make us</text>
  <text start="501.509" dur="5.791">believe that everything is fine I mean</text>
  <text start="504.689" dur="5.85">think about it they&amp;#39;re forecasting 8,000</text>
  <text start="507.3" dur="5.219">stores closing this year and if you look</text>
  <text start="510.539" dur="3.48">around your neighborhood and you look at</text>
  <text start="512.519" dur="3.601">some of the strip malls you could see a</text>
  <text start="514.019" dur="4.291">lot of stores have completely</text>
  <text start="516.12" dur="4.5">disappeared and when you go to the malls</text>
  <text start="518.31" dur="4.109">you can see there&amp;#39;s not many people in</text>
  <text start="520.62" dur="3.06">the Mol&amp;#39;s well this time of year it</text>
  <text start="522.419" dur="2.761">might be picking up because the holiday</text>
  <text start="523.68" dur="4.29">season is coming but I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you</text>
  <text start="525.18" dur="4.56">right now this holiday season is going</text>
  <text start="527.97" dur="3.72">to be a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="5.159">and remember online sales only make up</text>
  <text start="531.69" dur="5.399">10% of the entire retail market which is</text>
  <text start="534.899" dur="4.291">a trillion dollar market so when they</text>
  <text start="537.089" dur="4.321">tell you oh look Amazon you know they</text>
  <text start="539.19" dur="4.29">they received you know 1.3 million 3</text>
  <text start="541.41" dur="6.51">billion worth of sales that&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="543.48" dur="7.289">tiny little piece of it that&amp;#39;s it so we</text>
  <text start="547.92" dur="5.58">can see already that this entire global</text>
  <text start="550.769" dur="5.31">economic system it is imploding on them</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="4.41">on itself we&amp;#39;re seeing bubbles pop all</text>
  <text start="556.079" dur="4.231">over the place and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="557.91" dur="3.63">keep the manipulation moving forward</text>
  <text start="560.31" dur="3.06">here to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="561.54" dur="3.84">everything is fine we talked about</text>

  <text start="609.72" dur="2.34">dollar is going to be devalued which</text>
  <text start="611.1" dur="4.02">means it takes a lot more of those</text>
