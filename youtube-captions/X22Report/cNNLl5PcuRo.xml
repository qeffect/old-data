  <text start="182.77" dur="8.52">remove everything that the central bank</text>

  <text start="201.82" dur="5.27">their source of income</text>
  <text start="202.87" dur="10.11">oil oil was their source of income</text>
  <text start="207.09" dur="7.54">Obama CIA the Pentagon they could never</text>
  <text start="212.98" dur="7.68">find the source</text>
  <text start="214.63" dur="10.29">how were they continually getting the</text>
  <text start="220.66" dur="5.58">oil and making money Russia came in and</text>
  <text start="224.92" dur="3.78">said well what he talkin about here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.24" dur="5.4">the convoys remember back then Obama</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="4.5">called the shots and they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="231.64" dur="6.12">allowed to do anything unless he</text>
  <text start="233.2" dur="7.44">approved the source was the oil Russia</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="5.1">got rid of the source Trump then came in</text>
  <text start="240.64" dur="4.68">and helped out because he turned</text>
  <text start="242.86" dur="4.23">everything around so they got rid of the</text>
  <text start="245.32" dur="5.64">source and what happened to the Islamic</text>
  <text start="247.09" dur="6.6">state they fell apart the same thing is</text>
  <text start="250.96" dur="5.13">happening right now Trump in the</text>
  <text start="253.69" dur="4.83">Patriots they&amp;#39;re going after the source</text>
  <text start="256.09" dur="5.76">of the deep state the source of the</text>
  <text start="258.52" dur="5.37">central banks how do you do this where</text>
  <text start="261.85" dur="4.08">do you look and how do you get rid of it</text>
  <text start="263.89" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about that in</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="5.43">just a moment but first some good news</text>
  <text start="268.27" dur="5.94">we see that Ford right now they</text>
  <text start="271.36" dur="5.07">announced an additional one billion</text>
  <text start="274.21" dur="5.19">dollar investment in Chicago which will</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="7.2">bring 500 new jobs back to the United</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="6.71">States and we can see that they decided</text>
  <text start="283.63" dur="5.39">you know something we&amp;#39;re going to bring</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="5.77">manufacturing back to the United States</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="5.08">so think about what happened here all</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="5.03">these companies were moving their</text>
  <text start="294.1" dur="4.58">manufacturing base over to Mexico and</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="4.229">with</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="4.709">this policy that Trump set up with the</text>
  <text start="301.139" dur="5.661">new trade agreement we can see that</text>
  <text start="303.389" dur="5.931">manufacturing is now being moved back I</text>
  <text start="306.8" dur="6.61">mean think about what Trump is done here</text>
  <text start="309.32" dur="5.409">he implemented tariffs he reprioritized</text>
  <text start="313.41" dur="4.14">trade expectations</text>
  <text start="314.729" dur="6.331">he created investment sent incentives</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="5.97">lower regulation expanded economic</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="6.05">freedom allowing consumer demand to</text>
  <text start="323.52" dur="6.6">drive investment decisions he&amp;#39;s changing</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="5.5">everything the central bank and the deep</text>
  <text start="330.12" dur="4.799">state has done and making it possible</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="5.16">for companies to come back here to the</text>
  <text start="334.919" dur="5.431">United States so Ford said they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="337.77" dur="6.179">be hiring 500 workers and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="340.35" dur="4.5">to invest in Chicago this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="343.949" dur="4.081">fantastic</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="5.879">and Trump needs to do this he needs to</text>
  <text start="348.03" dur="5.04">bring back more manufacturing why he</text>
  <text start="350.729" dur="7.651">needs to do this because we will be</text>
  <text start="353.07" dur="7.59">transitioning now as he does this as he</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="5.37">when I say this as he brings back</text>
  <text start="360.66" dur="5.7">manufacturing and changes regulations</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="6.12">trade changes the trade deals changes</text>
  <text start="366.36" dur="6.57">everything at the same time he needs to</text>
  <text start="369.87" dur="5.16">take apart the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="4.08">bank and that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s doing that</text>
  <text start="375.03" dur="5.819">this is a lot of pieces to the puzzle</text>
  <text start="377.01" dur="5.909">that are all moving at the same time now</text>
  <text start="380.849" dur="4.201">let&amp;#39;s look at Venezuela for a second and</text>
  <text start="382.919" dur="5.941">as we look at it and as time goes on you</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="7.02">can see that the strategy that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="388.86" dur="5.61">used there is almost identical to the</text>
  <text start="392.07" dur="7.8">strategy that he used in North Korea and</text>
  <text start="394.47" dur="8.189">parts of it of Syria now Trump the</text>
  <text start="399.87" dur="5.94">Patriots they are allowing the deep</text>
  <text start="402.659" dur="7.26">state the central bank the neocons do</text>
  <text start="405.81" dur="6.599">what they do best push for regime change</text>
  <text start="409.919" dur="4.381">to keep their system operational now</text>
  <text start="412.409" dur="4.471">this is being done on purpose because</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="6.359">they&amp;#39;d rather have this whole entire</text>
  <text start="416.88" dur="5.819">plan be done under their watch so they</text>
  <text start="420.659" dur="5.25">know exactly what&amp;#39;s going on now the</text>
  <text start="422.699" dur="5.46">mainstream media and the neocons and the</text>
  <text start="425.909" dur="3.741">central bank they are falling for it I</text>
  <text start="428.159" dur="4.471">mean look at some of the media reports</text>
  <text start="429.65" dur="5.26">out of the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="432.63" dur="4.61">tensions rise as Venezuela blocks border</text>

  <text start="457.26" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re loving this this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="459.6" dur="4.71">the deep state the central bank&amp;#39;s wanted</text>
  <text start="461.67" dur="5.22">they are using the same script that they</text>
  <text start="464.31" dur="6">used before with Assad and others Maduro</text>
  <text start="466.89" dur="7.11">was blocking aid from the US out of</text>
