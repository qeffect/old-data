  <text start="299.96" dur="6.21">about 4.2 million euros so we can see at</text>
  <text start="303.89" dur="7.02">this point in time the country right now</text>
  <text start="306.17" dur="8.52">is going through a phase where the</text>
  <text start="310.91" dur="5.85">people of the country cannot support</text>
  <text start="314.69" dur="6.2">what is going on and they&amp;#39;re selling off</text>
  <text start="316.76" dur="7.74">bits and pieces industry is collapsing</text>
  <text start="320.89" dur="7.12">businesses cannot make it the people are</text>
  <text start="324.5" dur="8.3">suffering and they don&amp;#39;t trust the banks</text>
  <text start="328.01" dur="8.1">and the country is not going to make it</text>
  <text start="332.8" dur="7.15">not with more debt not with more</text>
  <text start="336.11" dur="8.66">austerity it just can&amp;#39;t work city right</text>
  <text start="339.95" dur="9.71">now has cut Greece&amp;#39;s 2015 gdp forecast</text>
  <text start="344.77" dur="11.74">to negative two point four percent to</text>
  <text start="349.66" dur="8.65">three-point-seven percent in 2016 so we</text>
  <text start="356.51" dur="4.95">can see GDP is going to go from negative</text>
  <text start="358.31" dur="4.32">two point four and they&amp;#39;re predicting</text>
  <text start="361.46" dur="5.3">it&amp;#39;s going to go all the way down to</text>
  <text start="362.63" dur="4.13">negative three point seven percent I</text>
  <text start="367.45" dur="11.14">mean this cannot be sustained whatsoever</text>
  <text start="373.49" dur="7.98">and the central bankers at this point</text>
  <text start="378.59" dur="4.95">they know this can&amp;#39;t be sustained they</text>
  <text start="381.47" dur="5.31">know the country is completely falling</text>
  <text start="383.54" dur="6.86">apart and this is why they are taking</text>
  <text start="386.78" dur="7.2">whatever they want from this country</text>
  <text start="390.4" dur="6.7">right now the Greek MPs they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="393.98" dur="5.1">vote on Wednesday two laws that could</text>
  <text start="397.1" dur="4.95">make or break the country&amp;#39;s prospects of</text>
  <text start="399.08" dur="4.52">an international bailout remember they</text>
  <text start="402.05" dur="4.71">have two things they need to do here</text>
  <text start="403.6" dur="6.34">they want to the bankers want them to</text>
  <text start="406.76" dur="6.44">reform their banking laws and they want</text>
  <text start="409.94" dur="5.6">an overhaul of Greece&amp;#39;s Civil Code and</text>
  <text start="413.2" dur="5.46">of course they have all that austerity</text>
  <text start="415.54" dur="5.32">they have to cut the pensions and</text>
  <text start="418.66" dur="3.67">there&amp;#39;s going to be vote on Wednesday</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="4.83">and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch us to see how</text>
  <text start="422.33" dur="8.6">this turns out now we talked a lot about</text>
  <text start="425.69" dur="8.15">how tsipras might have turned to Putin</text>
  <text start="430.93" dur="5.519">and asked for help well we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="433.84" dur="7.91">to find out that he actually did ask for</text>
  <text start="436.449" dur="9.021">help they had a plan B involving an</text>
  <text start="441.75" dur="8.199">emergency 10 billion loan from Putin</text>
  <text start="445.47" dur="8.949">which would have been used to fund a new</text>
  <text start="449.949" dur="7.731">Greek currency this is what they had</text>
  <text start="454.419" dur="6.931">planned according to Greek reporter</text>
  <text start="457.68" dur="6.13">Prime Minister tsipras has asked Russian</text>
  <text start="461.35" dur="6.06">President Putin for ten billion dollars</text>
  <text start="463.81" dur="5.94">in order to print drachmas Moscow&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.41" dur="4.71">response was a vague mention of a five</text>
  <text start="469.75" dur="3.93">billion dollar advance on the new South</text>
  <text start="472.12" dur="5.85">Stream natural gas pipeline construction</text>
  <text start="473.68" dur="6.269">that will pass through Greece tsipras</text>
  <text start="477.97" dur="6.9">also sent similar loan request to China</text>
  <text start="479.949" dur="7.021">and Iran but no but to no avail so right</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="4.53">now Putin was going to give them an</text>
  <text start="486.97" dur="6.33">advance of five billion for the South</text>
  <text start="489.4" dur="7.38">Stream gas pipeline China and Iran they</text>
  <text start="493.3" dur="7.46">really didn&amp;#39;t answer and because of this</text>
  <text start="496.78" dur="8.18">he had to accept well he didn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="500.76" dur="7.33">he went to the bankers and they kind of</text>
  <text start="504.96" dur="6.31">twisted his arm threatened him you have</text>
  <text start="508.09" dur="6.81">no way out you must accept what we are</text>
  <text start="511.27" dur="6.42">giving you and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="514.9" dur="6.03">in time this is what happened because we</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="6.24">saw the new drachma design we saw the</text>
  <text start="520.93" dur="5.49">drachma floating around in Greece we</text>
  <text start="523.93" dur="5.58">knew that tsipras had many meetings with</text>
  <text start="526.42" dur="7.35">Putin we knew they agreed they agreed</text>
  <text start="529.51" dur="6.87">upon the Turkish pipeline and we knew</text>
  <text start="533.77" dur="4.83">something was going on in the background</text>
  <text start="536.38" dur="5.85">that you didn&amp;#39;t know about and as soon</text>
  <text start="538.6" dur="9.51">as he couldn&amp;#39;t get Putin I mean Russia</text>
  <text start="542.23" dur="9.03">and China or Iran to help out the only</text>
  <text start="548.11" dur="4.289">other place was the bankers now I think</text>
  <text start="551.26" dur="4.35">he probably should have done it on his</text>
  <text start="552.399" dur="5.94">own without the backing take the hit</text>
  <text start="555.61" dur="7.68">because right now they&amp;#39;re no better off</text>
  <text start="558.339" dur="5.911">and we can see at this point I&amp;#39;m other</text>
  <text start="563.29" dur="2.31">countries are</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="5.22">looking at the situation and saying you</text>
  <text start="565.6" dur="6.05">know something we cannot stay with the</text>
  <text start="569.47" dur="5.42">eurozone because as we can see as</text>

  <text start="638.92" dur="7.86">reality is they have no plan to create</text>
  <text start="643.3" dur="5.4">jobs to spur economic growth the only</text>
  <text start="646.78" dur="4.89">plan they have is to push these</text>

  <text start="1519.8" dur="4.53">no proof whatsoever so it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1522.2" dur="3.99">very interesting when this report does</text>
  <text start="1524.33" dur="5.25">come out of course it will be</text>

  <text start="1552.73" dur="7.57">Ukraine has no way in the world to pay</text>
  <text start="1556.58" dur="6.02">any of this back well the whole point of</text>
  <text start="1560.3" dur="4.44">it is to keep them afloat long enough</text>
  <text start="1562.6" dur="4.6">for them to start war in the</text>

  <text start="1567.2" dur="5.64">those areas that have manufacturing and</text>
  <text start="1570.58" dur="5.29">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been planning for</text>

  <text start="1614.6" dur="9.09">and it hits someplace in a residential</text>
  <text start="1617.69" dur="9.39">area we see the OSCE is having a very</text>

  <text start="1657.649" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;re moving our weapons away and those</text>
  <text start="1659.69" dur="4.92">places they don&amp;#39;t want them to see they</text>
  <text start="1661.519" dur="4.951">say they&amp;#39;re restricted so you can see</text>
  <text start="1664.61" dur="5.189">what&amp;#39;s going on right now and then we</text>
  <text start="1666.47" dur="6.15">have the right sector right now causing</text>

  <text start="1672.62" dur="7.289">supporters are gathering in central kiev</text>
  <text start="1677.12" dur="4.86">and it seems like this might be driven</text>
  <text start="1679.909" dur="5.13">by the united states government central</text>
  <text start="1681.98" dur="5.49">bankers for another coup I think</text>
  <text start="1685.039" dur="4.921">poroshenko is not doing what they want</text>
  <text start="1687.47" dur="4.709">and that is pushing towards the</text>
  <text start="1689.96" dur="3.689">southeastern region and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1692.179" dur="5.821">they&amp;#39;re using the right sector once</text>
  <text start="1693.649" dur="8.721">again to push a coup d&amp;#39;état and maybe</text>
  <text start="1698" dur="7.98">remove poroshenko at this point in time</text>
  <text start="1702.37" dur="8.009">ukrainian volunteer battalions primarily</text>
  <text start="1705.98" dur="8.51">made up of right sector groups are</text>

  <text start="1718.879" dur="11.581">to oust poroshenko and it seems like</text>
  <text start="1724.7" dur="7.979">there&amp;#39;s going to be problems inside kiev</text>
  <text start="1730.46" dur="5.669">which could lead to a disastrous</text>

  <text start="1736.129" dur="5.52">out and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="1737.629" dur="7.611">that situation very very carefully now</text>
  <text start="1741.649" dur="5.791">the Russian army they&amp;#39;ve showcased a</text>
  <text start="1745.24" dur="5.47">state-of-the-art military equipment in</text>
  <text start="1747.44" dur="7.5">the city of Sevastopol on the Crimean</text>
  <text start="1750.71" dur="9.089">Peninsula and the new weapon they have</text>
  <text start="1754.94" dur="7.109">is platform em combat robot and it kind</text>
  <text start="1759.799" dur="3.821">of reminds me of the Terminator I think</text>
  <text start="1762.049" dur="3.131">was the t1</text>
  <text start="1763.62" dur="5.1">in the movie Terminator and it looks</text>
  <text start="1765.18" dur="5.7">just like that where the platform m is a</text>
  <text start="1768.72" dur="5.04">remote control robotic unit on a crawler</text>
  <text start="1770.88" dur="6.15">armed with a grenade launcher and rifles</text>
  <text start="1773.76" dur="4.98">and we&amp;#39;re looking like we&amp;#39;re heading in</text>
  <text start="1777.03" dur="3.6">that direction and I have a video on the</text>
  <text start="1778.74" dur="5.1">x 22 report com site if you like to come</text>
  <text start="1780.63" dur="6.51">and see that we see right now Iran is</text>
  <text start="1783.84" dur="4.92">questioning the agreement that all the</text>
  <text start="1787.14" dur="4.31">nations put together because in the</text>
  <text start="1788.76" dur="5.1">agreement they also included</text>
  <text start="1791.45" dur="4.54">conventional weapons ballistic missiles</text>
  <text start="1793.86" dur="4.35">and they&amp;#39;re saying this is not part of</text>
  <text start="1795.99" dur="5.37">the nuclear agreement and we have to</text>
  <text start="1798.21" dur="7.02">remember that this agreement was put</text>
  <text start="1801.36" dur="7.02">together most most likely by the central</text>
  <text start="1805.23" dur="6.449">banking group because their agenda is to</text>
  <text start="1808.38" dur="4.95">get into Iran and to get into their</text>
  <text start="1811.679" dur="5.25">central bank and place the dollar on</text>
  <text start="1813.33" dur="5.64">their natural resources to prop up the</text>
  <text start="1816.929" dur="6.241">petro dollar and then we have another</text>
  <text start="1818.97" dur="6.9">entity where they want that government</text>
  <text start="1823.17" dur="5.93">in Iran completely removed they want</text>
  <text start="1825.87" dur="6.66">control of the entire country the land</text>
  <text start="1829.1" dur="5.38">the natural resources so we have two</text>
  <text start="1832.53" dur="6.029">things happening right now and we have</text>
  <text start="1834.48" dur="6.9">two agendas going on in Iran but the</text>
  <text start="1838.559" dur="5.701">goal is always the same the goal is to</text>
  <text start="1841.38" dur="6.03">take over the natural resources and to</text>
  <text start="1844.26" dur="4.919">prop up the petro dollar and we can see</text>
  <text start="1847.41" dur="5.25">right now Iran is out there saying</text>
  <text start="1849.179" dur="6.031">listen there is no place in our defense</text>
  <text start="1852.66" dur="4.71">doctrine for unconventional weapons and</text>
  <text start="1855.21" dur="5.21">we consider keeping and using such</text>
  <text start="1857.37" dur="5.28">weapons to be religiously prohibited and</text>
  <text start="1860.42" dur="3.79">they&amp;#39;re absolutely right the nuclear</text>
  <text start="1862.65" dur="3.93">agreement has nothing to do with their</text>
  <text start="1864.21" dur="5.969">conventional weapons but if this deal</text>
  <text start="1866.58" dur="6.45">goes south or something occurs once the</text>
  <text start="1870.179" dur="5.13">deal is passed they want the ability to</text>
  <text start="1873.03" dur="3.3">go into Iran very easily and this is why</text>
  <text start="1875.309" dur="7.101">they want them to get rid of their</text>
  <text start="1876.33" dur="8.97">conventional weapons we see out in Syria</text>
  <text start="1882.41" dur="5.62">the Syrian Prime Minister is saying</text>
  <text start="1885.3" dur="5.58">listen this us-led international</text>
  <text start="1888.03" dur="5.85">coalition in Syria it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="1890.88" dur="5.88">unproductive in the fight against</text>
  <text start="1893.88" dur="3.68">terrorism they&amp;#39;re not coordinating with</text>
  <text start="1896.76" dur="3.33">serene</text>
  <text start="1897.56" dur="4.69">they&amp;#39;re not hitting the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1900.09" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re hitting the infrastructure of</text>
  <text start="1902.25" dur="7.62">Syria and it seems like it&amp;#39;s not working</text>
  <text start="1906.42" dur="4.62">whatsoever and we know it&amp;#39;s not because</text>
  <text start="1909.87" dur="3.27">we know the Unites States government</text>
  <text start="1911.04" dur="5.64">central bankers they&amp;#39;re not going to hit</text>
  <text start="1913.14" dur="5.79">their own proxy army that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="1916.68" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re there for they&amp;#39;re there to</text>
  <text start="1918.93" dur="5.97">destroy the infrastructure to clear the</text>
  <text start="1921.03" dur="8.01">way for the proxy army to march into</text>
  <text start="1924.9" dur="6.21">Damascus and to remove Assad this is why</text>
  <text start="1929.04" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s no coordination this is why the</text>
  <text start="1931.11" dur="4.35">United States and the coalition June</text>
  <text start="1932.58" dur="5.88">join up with China and Russia there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1935.46" dur="5.34">reason this didn&amp;#39;t happen the reason</text>
  <text start="1938.46" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s because they have a different</text>
  <text start="1940.8" dur="5.04">agenda and a different goal now of</text>
  <text start="1943.74" dur="4.26">course Russia and China they know what</text>
  <text start="1945.84" dur="4.86">is happening here so does the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1948" dur="6.9">government they know that all of this is</text>
  <text start="1950.7" dur="5.94">part of their agenda and we can see</text>
  <text start="1954.9" dur="4.44">right now they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="1956.64" dur="4.74">possibly can Russia is trying to do this</text>
  <text start="1959.34" dur="5.61">peacefully having both sides meet it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1961.38" dur="5.82">really not working out the United States</text>
  <text start="1964.95" dur="3.81">and the coalition forces are continuing</text>
  <text start="1967.2" dur="4.67">the propaganda that they&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="1968.76" dur="9.66">terrorism in this part of the world and</text>
  <text start="1971.87" dur="8.41">eventually something will occur because</text>
  <text start="1978.42" dur="3.54">this is really not getting them anywhere</text>
  <text start="1980.28" dur="6.27">and eventually they&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="1981.96" dur="8.46">boots on the ground to take over parts</text>
  <text start="1986.55" dur="7.2">of Syria and right now they do not have</text>
  <text start="1990.42" dur="7.34">the ability to do this and we can see we</text>
  <text start="1993.75" dur="8.07">are definitely leading up to this and</text>
  <text start="1997.76" dur="6.67">it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time I mean look</text>
  <text start="2001.82" dur="5.91">if we go back to August of 2013 with the</text>
  <text start="2004.43" dur="5.19">sarin gas attack fast forward to 2014 in</text>
  <text start="2007.73" dur="5.28">that summer when all of a sudden we did</text>
