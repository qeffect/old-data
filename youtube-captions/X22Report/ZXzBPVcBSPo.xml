  <text start="51.69" dur="4.92">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="53.129" dur="6.601">episode 1198 a and today theta is</text>
  <text start="56.61" dur="5.37">februari 7th 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="59.73" dur="5.389">episode is everything is almost in place</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="6.179">the economic crisis is about to begin</text>
  <text start="65.119" dur="5.741">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="68.159" dur="8.1">financial news now yesterday we were</text>
  <text start="70.86" dur="8.429">talking about Greece and how verra</text>
  <text start="76.259" dur="5.97">farkas was out there telling tsipras</text>
  <text start="79.289" dur="6.78">that they need to make a parallel system</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="6.95">and you need to really think about why</text>
  <text start="86.069" dur="4.981">is he talking about a parallel system</text>
  <text start="89.179" dur="4.69">because there are other countries that</text>
  <text start="91.05" dur="5.819">created parallel systems China Russia</text>
  <text start="93.869" dur="4.741">and other countries are looking at this</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="4.741">thing you know something maybe we</text>
  <text start="98.61" dur="5.91">shouldn&amp;#39;t depend on the euro maybe we</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="4.709">should have other currencies China</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="4.08">Russia were saying maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="106.319" dur="4.5">depend on the dollar maybe we should</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="4.59">depend on our own currency and the</text>
  <text start="110.819" dur="4.86">reason for this is because they realize</text>
  <text start="113.19" dur="5.73">may understand that as we move</text>
  <text start="115.679" dur="6.03">throughout this year as more and more</text>
  <text start="118.92" dur="7.86">people are waking up as countries start</text>
  <text start="121.709" dur="8.461">to vote away the government that they</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="5.88">have right now they understand that</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="4.77">things are going to rapidly deteriorate</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="5.969">because the central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="134.94" dur="6.72">take too kindly when you try to get rid</text>
  <text start="138.629" dur="5.791">of them they want the system they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="141.66" dur="6.329">been around for hundreds or thousands of</text>
  <text start="144.42" dur="6.929">years and they like their system may</text>
  <text start="147.989" dur="5.72">become very wealthy they put countries</text>
  <text start="151.349" dur="4.621">into debt and they like the control and</text>
  <text start="153.709" dur="5.131">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is Greece is</text>
  <text start="155.97" dur="8.45">actually they&amp;#39;re planning a default on a</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="8.47">74 billion euro loan right now and</text>
  <text start="164.42" dur="6.19">because what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="5.399">original deal brokered wasn&amp;#39;t really in</text>
  <text start="170.61" dur="4.019">Greece&amp;#39;s best interest well it&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="172.709" dur="7.921">been increases best interest actually</text>
  <text start="174.629" dur="6.881">all these deals that the EU the Fed the</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="3.85">IMF</text>
  <text start="181.51" dur="5.399">all these deals that they broker is</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="4.53">never in the best interest of the people</text>
  <text start="186.909" dur="5.311">and the country it&amp;#39;s in the best</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="5.91">interest for them their product is dead</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="6.03">they want the hard assets they want the</text>
  <text start="194.92" dur="7.319">people to suffer they like austerity it</text>
  <text start="198.25" dur="8.79">makes the country week a week country is</text>
  <text start="202.239" dur="9">easy to pillage it&amp;#39;s easy to take what</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="7.83">they want and we can see that throughout</text>
  <text start="211.239" dur="7.981">Europe countries they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="214.87" dur="6.509">fail the economy is weakening in each</text>
  <text start="219.22" dur="4.32">one of these countries it has been for a</text>
  <text start="221.379" dur="4.23">very long time we&amp;#39;ve gone through a lot</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="4.14">of manipulation and the manipulation</text>
  <text start="225.609" dur="3.931">well those numbers they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="227.68" dur="3.72">making sense anymore for what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="229.54" dur="4.5">going on in the economy when we look out</text>
  <text start="231.4" dur="5.899">in Germany we see industrial production</text>
  <text start="234.04" dur="6.93">well that&amp;#39;s plunge most since 2009 and</text>
  <text start="237.299" dur="5.621">things are not going well there I mean</text>
  <text start="240.97" dur="4.919">we look at the figures which exclude</text>
  <text start="242.92" dur="4.92">construction which is comparable to the</text>
  <text start="245.889" dur="4.651">industrial production data reported by</text>
  <text start="247.84" dur="4.56">eurostat it declined by an even greater</text>
  <text start="250.54" dur="4.05">three-point-one percent the contraction</text>
  <text start="252.4" dur="4.86">was largely driven by capital goods</text>
  <text start="254.59" dur="7.53">which subtracted 2 percentage points</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="6.33">from their headline figures so what</text>
  <text start="262.12" dur="4.769">we&amp;#39;re looking at right now is Europe</text>
  <text start="263.59" dur="6.27">Europe&amp;#39;s largest economy the region&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.889" dur="5.911">growth driver faces a series of risks</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="7.89">that made amp output in the coming</text>
  <text start="272.8" dur="8.16">months so we can see at this point we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="277.75" dur="5.9">seeing many countries where the economy</text>
  <text start="280.96" dur="6.709">is starting to slow dramatically and</text>
  <text start="283.65" dur="6.549">it&amp;#39;s going to continually slow the US</text>
  <text start="287.669" dur="4.151">has been flowing but you have to</text>
  <text start="290.199" dur="4.171">understand they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating</text>
  <text start="291.82" dur="5.31">keeping us in this illusion being pumped</text>
  <text start="294.37" dur="4.68">up with drugs because as you give more</text>
  <text start="297.13" dur="4.08">and more drugs to someone who&amp;#39;s on drugs</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="4.7">they feel good it doesn&amp;#39;t fix the</text>
  <text start="301.21" dur="6.239">problem because when the drugs wear off</text>
  <text start="303.75" dur="7.15">guess what happens you have the pain you</text>
  <text start="307.449" dur="6.09">have the reversal of that feeling and</text>
  <text start="310.9" dur="4.09">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening now all that</text>
  <text start="313.539" dur="4.271">manipulation</text>
  <text start="314.99" dur="7.59">all that pumping in of this free money</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="7.62">well it&amp;#39;s coming to an end and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="6.45">working the way it used to work people</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="4.98">are starting to realize hey they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.03" dur="3.27">telling us the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="330.41" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re telling us that everything is</text>
  <text start="332.3" dur="5.25">fine why am I still out of work why do</text>
  <text start="335.33" dur="5.82">the EU countries still have an</text>
  <text start="337.55" dur="6.6">unemployment around nine ten percent I</text>
  <text start="341.15" dur="5.57">mean think about this for a second over</text>
  <text start="344.15" dur="6.18">the many years eight years it fluctuated</text>
  <text start="346.72" dur="8.74">9.5 all the way up to 10.5 has a really</text>
  <text start="350.33" dur="8.67">gotten better no grease since 2008 what</text>
  <text start="355.46" dur="5.46">they fluctuated between twenty five or</text>
  <text start="359" dur="5.16">twenty three percent and thirty percent</text>
  <text start="360.92" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s not getting better yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.16" dur="3.03">trying to convince us that it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="365.33" dur="3">better but it really isn&amp;#39;t here in the</text>
  <text start="367.19" dur="3.59">United States is completely different</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="5.94">story because they completely manipulate</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="6.58">everything especially the job numbers</text>
  <text start="374.27" dur="6.06">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="377.36" dur="6.21">the pace of hiring appears to have</text>
  <text start="380.33" dur="6.87">tapered off after hitting cycle highs in</text>
  <text start="383.57" dur="6.12">February at 5.5 million and remaining</text>
  <text start="387.2" dur="5.46">let levels largely unchanged over the</text>
  <text start="389.69" dur="6.06">last two years the pace of job additions</text>
  <text start="392.66" dur="6.12">has been declining in the past two years</text>
  <text start="395.75" dur="6.44">Ned hiring also appears to have</text>
  <text start="398.78" dur="6.6">plateaued and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="6.61">where everything is plateauing things</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="6.57">start to decline and this was back in</text>
  <text start="408.8" dur="7.1">two thousand six going into 2007 and</text>
  <text start="411.95" dur="6.6">then we had the great recession in 2008</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="4.78">well this time we have a lot more</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="5.52">manipulation but we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="420.68" dur="6.93">exact patterns discharge another layoff</text>
  <text start="424.07" dur="6.12">jumped by 16,000 in December rising to</text>
  <text start="427.61" dur="7.74">1.6 million the third consecutive</text>
  <text start="430.19" dur="7.26">monthly increased and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="435.35" dur="4.92">employers right now appeared to be</text>
  <text start="437.45" dur="8.37">finally accelerating terminations of</text>
  <text start="440.27" dur="7.36">workers this is not a good sign we see</text>
  <text start="445.82" dur="3.79">the Atlanta Fed</text>
  <text start="447.63" dur="6">have cut the first quarter GDP right now</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="6.63">from 3.4 already to 2.7 we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="453.63" dur="4.86">hitting that five percent that&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="456.24" dur="4.92">impossibility at this point maybe when</text>
  <text start="458.49" dur="5.64">we have the reset and everything started</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="6.15">everything starts over yes maybe at that</text>
  <text start="464.13" dur="4.44">point we might hit five percent well we</text>
  <text start="467.31" dur="3.59">have to bring back all the jobs</text>
  <text start="468.57" dur="6.32">manufacturing em is a lot to go with it</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="7.81">but right now in this current economy</text>
  <text start="474.89" dur="6.84">well it&amp;#39;s not going anywhere the US</text>
  <text start="478.71" dur="5.31">economy is going to be rolling over</text>
  <text start="481.73" dur="5.08">because remember we talked about it</text>
  <text start="484.02" dur="5.91">employment growth has turned negative at</text>
  <text start="486.81" dur="6.75">the S&amp;amp;P 500 companies and we talked</text>
  <text start="489.93" dur="7.23">about the tax receipts and when we look</text>
  <text start="493.56" dur="5.64">at the information we see that the tax</text>
  <text start="497.16" dur="5.75">receipts the federal government current</text>
  <text start="499.2" dur="9.36">tax receipts have been declining since</text>
  <text start="502.91" dur="10.18">2010 these state taxes have been</text>
  <text start="508.56" dur="10.05">declining since 2010 now going back to</text>
  <text start="513.09" dur="9.199">2010 we see the percentage of tax</text>
  <text start="518.61" dur="7.5">returns was around twenty percent today</text>
  <text start="522.289" dur="6.491">it&amp;#39;s around three percent the state</text>
  <text start="526.11" dur="6.3">taxes were around ten percent today</text>
  <text start="528.78" dur="6.24">there around two percent and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.41" dur="4.2">continually declining now think about</text>
  <text start="535.02" dur="4.73">this for a second they&amp;#39;ve been telling</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="6.09">us that employment has been fine that</text>
  <text start="539.75" dur="4.12">the unemployment from 2010 moving</text>
  <text start="542.7" dur="2.82">forward one from like something like</text>
  <text start="543.87" dur="3.9">nine ten percent all the way down to</text>
  <text start="545.52" dur="5.19">four point eight percent so we had</text>
  <text start="547.77" dur="6.96">falling unemployment numbers and the tax</text>
  <text start="550.71" dur="7.83">receipts have been declining rapidly</text>
  <text start="554.73" dur="6.38">over this period of time going from</text>
  <text start="558.54" dur="7.22">federal tax receipts going from twenty</text>
  <text start="561.11" dur="9.07">percent in twenty ten to ten percent in</text>
  <text start="565.76" dur="10.03">2013 29</text>
  <text start="570.18" dur="7.68">in 2015 beginning of 2016 it was below</text>
  <text start="575.79" dur="4.47">zero then popped up a little bit to</text>
  <text start="577.86" dur="4.89">three percent how could this be possible</text>
  <text start="580.26" dur="5.76">if we&amp;#39;re almost at full employment and</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="5.279">everyone is happy and working well we</text>
  <text start="586.02" dur="3.629">know these numbers are fake we know a</text>
  <text start="588.029" dur="3.361">lot of people who went from a full-time</text>
  <text start="589.649" dur="3.031">job making a lot of good money because</text>
  <text start="591.39" dur="4.65">yet to remember when you make good money</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="5.279">your tax more I mean there are some</text>
  <text start="596.04" dur="4.38">people that get around it but majority</text>
  <text start="597.959" dur="4.561">of the people will have the taxes taken</text>
  <text start="600.42" dur="4.919">out of their paycheck and it goes to the</text>
  <text start="602.52" dur="4.759">government when you get a job that</text>
  <text start="605.339" dur="5.701">doesn&amp;#39;t pay as much like a part-time job</text>
  <text start="607.279" dur="5.951">well it&amp;#39;s less taxes taken out that are</text>
  <text start="611.04" dur="4.26">sent to the government when you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="613.23" dur="6.87">have a job well that&amp;#39;s very easy that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="615.3" dur="8.22">just 0 and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="620.1" dur="4.859">seeing so the idea that the use economy</text>
  <text start="623.52" dur="4.11">the US economy is about to explode</text>
  <text start="624.959" dur="5.671">higher based on Trump taking off as well</text>
  <text start="627.63" dur="6.54">that&amp;#39;s completely off base right now and</text>
  <text start="630.63" dur="7.38">what we we&amp;#39;ve been seeing with Trump he</text>
  <text start="634.17" dur="6.57">is preparing for the economy after the</text>
  <text start="638.01" dur="5.88">entire system collapses he&amp;#39;s preparing</text>
  <text start="640.74" dur="6.08">to bring jobs back he&amp;#39;s preparing to</text>
  <text start="643.89" dur="7.38">bring manufacturing back he&amp;#39;s preparing</text>
  <text start="646.82" dur="8.68">all of this for after the system</text>
  <text start="651.27" dur="6.15">implodes not for this present economy</text>
  <text start="655.5" dur="4.5">and that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re headed right now</text>
  <text start="657.42" dur="5.97">because we can see right now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="660" dur="4.92">battle going on who&amp;#39;s going to bring</text>
  <text start="663.39" dur="5.01">down the economy who is it going to be</text>
  <text start="664.92" dur="5.64">blamed on and who&amp;#39;s going to restart it</text>
  <text start="668.4" dur="4.14">is it going to be the central bank</text>
  <text start="670.56" dur="4.32">economy or is it going to be the</text>
  <text start="672.54" dur="4.35">people&amp;#39;s economy and this is the battle</text>
  <text start="674.88" dur="3.93">we have going on right now for all those</text>
  <text start="676.89" dur="3.72">individuals who believe that everything</text>
  <text start="678.81" dur="4.86">is fine right now that everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="680.61" dur="5.849">going to just work out well I would</text>
  <text start="683.67" dur="5.4">start preparing right now because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="686.459" dur="4.831">hearing from a lot of people that are</text>
  <text start="689.07" dur="5.34">looking at the data looking at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="691.29" dur="5.58">going on realizing that Trump is</text>
  <text start="694.41" dur="5.79">continually pushing out more and more</text>
  <text start="696.87" dur="5.49">truth bombs saying that eventually</text>
  <text start="700.2" dur="4.05">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the plug is</text>
  <text start="702.36" dur="4.59">going to be pulled one way or another</text>
  <text start="704.25" dur="4.77">and it depends on the narrative of the</text>
  <text start="706.95" dur="6.33">story but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="709.02" dur="6.39">the preparation for this and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="713.28" dur="3.57">wait too long because they can&amp;#39;t wait</text>
  <text start="715.41" dur="8.07">for something to come out of left field</text>
  <text start="716.85" dur="9.6">and we can see it is a race to see who</text>
  <text start="723.48" dur="7.76">brings the system down first who is to</text>
  <text start="726.45" dur="7.56">blame how the system is restarted and</text>
  <text start="731.24" dur="4.78">we&amp;#39;re going to go through pain where</text>
  <text start="734.01" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re going to go through a period of</text>
  <text start="736.02" dur="4.62">time where it&amp;#39;s not going to be pleasant</text>
  <text start="738.15" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s like someone who has been on drugs</text>
  <text start="740.64" dur="6.03">who&amp;#39;s been cut off of the drug who&amp;#39;s</text>
