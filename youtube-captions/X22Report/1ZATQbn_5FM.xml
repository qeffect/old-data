  <text start="247.98" dur="4.439">other employer provided health plans</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="4.5">have always enjoyed there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="252.419" dur="4.38">restrictions and it was impossible until</text>

  <text start="259.47" dur="5.28">been a success and I think it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="4.89">be for many people this will be the way</text>
  <text start="264.75" dur="4.77">of the future the previous</text>
  <text start="266.849" dur="5.011">administration imposed crushing fines</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="4.649">and other penalties on HRAs to prevent</text>
  <text start="271.86" dur="4.679">employees from selecting the plan of</text>
  <text start="274.169" dur="4.081">their choice it was impossible we are</text>
  <text start="276.539" dur="3.6">eliminating all those restrictions and</text>
  <text start="278.25" dur="4.229">thanks to the changes we&amp;#39;re making an</text>
  <text start="280.139" dur="4.561">estimated 11 million Americans will now</text>

  <text start="284.7" dur="6.81">the HRAs this is just the first step</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="6.389">remember Trump is pushing to get</text>
  <text start="291.51" dur="5.58">Obamacare completely eradicated the</text>
  <text start="294.599" dur="2.911">penalty is gone now and I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.09" dur="2.22">going to</text>
  <text start="297.51" dur="3.51">and we&amp;#39;re gonna be moving into something</text>

  <text start="301.02" dur="7.19">this the health benefits the trade plan</text>
  <text start="304.83" dur="7.53">getting rid of the swamp all of this is</text>
  <text start="308.21" dur="7.69">the reset remember the politicians</text>
  <text start="312.36" dur="6.11">before this they were not doing this in</text>
  <text start="315.9" dur="5.04">the best interest of the American people</text>
  <text start="318.47" dur="4.77">they were doing this in the best</text>
  <text start="320.94" dur="6.33">interest for themselves the lobbyists</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="7.41">corporations and many others they had a</text>
  <text start="327.27" dur="7.23">completely different plan and now</text>
  <text start="330.65" dur="6.28">everything is being reversed and guess</text>
  <text start="334.5" dur="5.97">what the deep state doesn&amp;#39;t like this</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re panicking now the Dems the deep</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="4.71">state players they are trying to push</text>
  <text start="343.44" dur="3.33">impeachment and it seems that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="345.18" dur="4.56">going very well for them</text>
  <text start="346.77" dur="4.32">remember there&amp;#39;s no crime the Malheur</text>
  <text start="349.74" dur="4.14">report says there&amp;#39;s no obstruction</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="5.85">there&amp;#39;s no collusion and they need this</text>
  <text start="353.88" dur="5.76">to support the impeachment process but</text>
  <text start="356.94" dur="4.7">the impeachment support is dwindling and</text>
  <text start="359.64" dur="4.83">Trump tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="361.64" dur="5.2">yesterday was the radical left Democrats</text>
  <text start="364.47" dur="4.56">big impeachment day they worked so hard</text>
  <text start="366.84" dur="5.16">to make it&amp;#39;s something really big and</text>
  <text start="369.03" dur="5.58">special but one problem almost nobody</text>
  <text start="372" dur="5.13">showed up the medium it&amp;#39;s low turnout</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="4.13">for anti Trump rallies all around the</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="3.69">country people are saying enough</text>
  <text start="378.74" dur="4.87">Democrat voters want to hear the</text>
  <text start="380.82" dur="5.01">politicians talking about issues this is</text>
  <text start="383.61" dur="5.73">a huge distraction and will only help</text>
  <text start="385.83" dur="5.58">Trump get elected greatest president</text>
  <text start="389.34" dur="6.9">since Ronald Reagan said a counter</text>
  <text start="391.41" dur="8.64">protester Lehigh Valley live the entire</text>
  <text start="396.24" dur="7.23">narrative to get Trump out of office is</text>
  <text start="400.05" dur="5.61">based on the Russian collusion story the</text>
  <text start="403.47" dur="4.92">mainstream medium leaves 8 they cannot</text>
  <text start="405.66" dur="5.55">deviate from this story they need to</text>
  <text start="408.39" dur="5.55">continue the lie what happens if they</text>
  <text start="411.21" dur="5.49">deviate what happens if they say ok</text>
  <text start="413.94" dur="6.39">there is no Russian collusion all of</text>
  <text start="416.7" dur="6.86">their stories fall apart let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="6.03">the DNC Russian hacking story</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="6.64">the Department of Justice previously</text>
  <text start="426.36" dur="4.889">admitted the DNC would not let the FBI</text>
  <text start="430.2" dur="4.139">investing</text>
  <text start="431.249" dur="6.48">review the DNC server instead the DNC</text>
  <text start="434.339" dur="4.92">provided the FBI with the analysis of a</text>
  <text start="437.729" dur="4.29">technical review done through a</text>
  <text start="439.259" dur="5.76">cybersecurity contract with CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="442.019" dur="5.79">the narrative around the DNC hack claim</text>
  <text start="445.019" dur="4.68">was always very sketchy many people</text>
  <text start="447.809" dur="4.16">believe the DNC email dated was</text>
  <text start="449.699" dur="6.57">downloaded onto a flash drive and leaked</text>
  <text start="451.969" dur="6.88">bill Binney well with others he was part</text>
  <text start="456.269" dur="5.1">of the NSA they went ahead and they</text>
  <text start="458.849" dur="5.52">looked at the times of the download and</text>
  <text start="461.369" dur="7.04">said it would be impossible to download</text>
  <text start="464.369" dur="7.32">it across the ocean instead these times</text>
  <text start="468.409" dur="7">mimic that download onto a flash drive</text>
  <text start="471.689" dur="8.28">and a lot of individuals have done the</text>
  <text start="475.409" dur="8.34">same exact test now when looking at this</text>
  <text start="479.969" dur="8.25">court filing that came out</text>
  <text start="483.749" dur="7.23">the story begins to fall apart discovery</text>

  <text start="1488.89" dur="5.31">an upcoming cyber attack war</text>
  <text start="1491.32" dur="6.27">think about what they&amp;#39;re setting up the</text>

  <text start="1528.46" dur="7.59">States remember they had this plan this</text>
  <text start="1532.48" dur="5.16">is their event of all events and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1536.05" dur="4.26">been planning this for a very long time</text>
