  <text start="56.92" dur="2.69">rapport my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.54" dur="4.85">episode</text>
  <text start="59.61" dur="7.15">1519 a and today&amp;#39;s date is March 12th</text>
  <text start="63.39" dur="5.89">2018 and the title of the episode is why</text>
  <text start="66.76" dur="5.67">are the central bank officials screaming</text>
  <text start="69.28" dur="6.03">and yelling let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.43" dur="5.31">collapse financial news now we are</text>
  <text start="75.31" dur="4.41">starting to see that governments are</text>
  <text start="77.74" dur="2.7">taking crypto currencies very very</text>
  <text start="79.72" dur="4.59">seriously</text>
  <text start="80.44" dur="6.36">and they&amp;#39;re pushing forth regulations</text>
  <text start="84.31" dur="5.25">now some regulations are good some are</text>
  <text start="86.8" dur="5.34">bad and the latest regulation and this</text>
  <text start="89.56" dur="3.449">is coming from a federal judge on</text>
  <text start="92.14" dur="4.31">cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="93.009" dur="6.661">which he ruled saying that those</text>
  <text start="96.45" dur="6.52">manipulating cryptocurrencies can now go</text>
  <text start="99.67" dur="4.44">to jail now we need to think about this</text>
  <text start="102.97" dur="4.17">first second and we know that the</text>
  <text start="104.11" dur="5.22">central banking system has the ability</text>
  <text start="107.14" dur="5.58">to manipulate we also know the</text>
  <text start="109.33" dur="7.319">individual out in Japan has been dumping</text>
  <text start="112.72" dur="6.149">a lot of Bitcoin which when you dump</text>
  <text start="116.649" dur="5.791">that amount and you sell it off it</text>
  <text start="118.869" dur="5.881">lowers the price and the central banks</text>
  <text start="122.44" dur="6.87">they can do the same exact thing where</text>
  <text start="124.75" dur="7.26">they can use their fiat currency they</text>
  <text start="129.31" dur="5.22">can create as much as they want buy up</text>
  <text start="132.01" dur="5.85">Bitcoin and then dump it to make it look</text>
  <text start="134.53" dur="5.28">like Bitcoin is volatile or do this to</text>
  <text start="137.86" dur="3.81">any cryptocurrency to make it look like</text>
  <text start="139.81" dur="5.07">the cryptocurrency market is very</text>
  <text start="141.67" dur="6.24">volatile and we can see a judge was out</text>
  <text start="144.88" dur="6.06">there and he made a ruling US District</text>
  <text start="147.91" dur="4.14">Judge Jack Weinstein for the Eastern</text>
  <text start="150.94" dur="3.78">District of New York ruled that</text>
  <text start="152.05" dur="4.95">cryptocurrencies are indeed commodities</text>
  <text start="154.72" dur="5.34">under the Commodity Exchange Act and</text>
  <text start="157" dur="4.83">therefore subject to the CFTC&amp;#39;s anti</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="5.039">fraud an anti manipulation enforcement</text>
  <text start="161.83" dur="5.61">authority this allowed the case to go</text>
  <text start="165.099" dur="6.631">forward and this also could be applied</text>
  <text start="167.44" dur="7.019">to those banks that are controlled by</text>
  <text start="171.73" dur="4.979">the or or I should say intertwine with</text>
  <text start="174.459" dur="5.61">the central bank where they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="176.709" dur="6.81">maybe manipulate the crypto market now</text>
  <text start="180.069" dur="6.421">we understand they don&amp;#39;t like the crypto</text>
  <text start="183.519" dur="5.431">market they see that this</text>
  <text start="186.49" dur="5.22">a threat to their business and if it</text>
  <text start="188.95" dur="3.84">does become some type of currency and we</text>
  <text start="191.71" dur="3.92">know there are certain states already</text>
  <text start="192.79" dur="6.3">saying that you can use cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="195.63" dur="5.07">Bitcoin I should say to pay for taxes we</text>
  <text start="199.09" dur="4.65">know that businesses are looking at</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="5.8">cryptocurrencies to allow people to</text>
  <text start="203.74" dur="4.5">purchase their goods using this and</text>
  <text start="206.5" dur="4.62">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen as</text>
  <text start="208.24" dur="5.43">employers are gonna say hey why don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="211.12" dur="4.35">just pay people in cryptocurrency now</text>
  <text start="213.67" dur="4.05">again the central banks don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="215.47" dur="4.59">people to use the crypto market because</text>
  <text start="217.72" dur="6.33">then you wouldn&amp;#39;t be using their finance</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="6.18">system and they don&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="224.05" dur="6.03">happen they want everyone to use the</text>
  <text start="226.24" dur="5.82">Federal Reserve Note but as we know the</text>
  <text start="230.08" dur="6.81">central banking system I think at this</text>
  <text start="232.06" dur="7.47">point is doomed they&amp;#39;re under threat why</text>
  <text start="236.89" dur="5.15">do I say this well Trump put forth his</text>
  <text start="239.53" dur="4.74">tariff plant now there are many</text>
  <text start="242.04" dur="4.87">countries out there that are screaming</text>
  <text start="244.27" dur="3.9">and yelling and China already said</text>
  <text start="246.91" dur="4.59">listen we&amp;#39;re not gonna start a trade war</text>
  <text start="248.17" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s not what we&amp;#39;re going to do we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="4.47">have to wait and see but this is what</text>
  <text start="253.24" dur="6.86">they&amp;#39;re saying the central banks on the</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="6.69">other hand the ECB the IMF the Fed</text>
  <text start="260.1" dur="4.6">they&amp;#39;re all out there and the corporate</text>
  <text start="262.66" dur="4.47">media included saying tariffs are the</text>
  <text start="264.7" dur="4.29">worst thing ever we should not do this</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="5.28">this is going to hurt the global economy</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="6.38">this is not good for our system what</text>
  <text start="272.41" dur="8.13">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s not good for their</text>
  <text start="275.37" dur="8.97">system and we see right now the central</text>
  <text start="280.54" dur="8.12">banks they are very nervous and afraid</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="7.99">that their system will be taking down</text>
  <text start="288.66" dur="6.19">eventually they know and they see the</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="3.96">writing is on the wall the Federal</text>
  <text start="294.85" dur="4.17">Reserve Bank of Atlanta president</text>
  <text start="296.29" dur="5.85">Raphael Bostic said steel and aluminum</text>
  <text start="299.02" dur="6.41">terraces bring uncertainty that could</text>
  <text start="302.14" dur="5.9">hurt the economy&amp;#39;s robust growth</text>
  <text start="305.43" dur="6.19">Christine Lagarde was out there saying</text>
  <text start="308.04" dur="6.52">these tariffs will not help the global</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="4.62">economy European trade commissioner has</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="5.79">promised that Europe would fight back</text>
  <text start="316.24" dur="6.78">against those who intimidate its trade</text>
  <text start="320.35" dur="5.36">eels I mean think about what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.02" dur="4.95">saying right now think about who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="5.14">systemness is this is not the people</text>
  <text start="327.97" dur="5.82">system and we need to remember something</text>
  <text start="330.85" dur="7.32">very very important here the central</text>
  <text start="333.79" dur="8.97">bank was removed from the United States</text>
  <text start="338.17" dur="7.47">by Andrew Jackson this was back in 1836</text>
  <text start="342.76" dur="4.38">he abolished the Bank of the United</text>
  <text start="345.64" dur="5.37">States that&amp;#39;s what it was called back</text>
  <text start="347.14" dur="5.91">then arguing that it exerted undue and</text>
  <text start="351.01" dur="4.88">unhealthy influence over the course of</text>
  <text start="353.05" dur="7.29">the national of the national economy</text>
  <text start="355.89" dur="6.76">from then until 1913 the United States</text>
  <text start="360.34" dur="4.77">didn&amp;#39;t allow the formation of a private</text>
  <text start="362.65" dur="4.37">central bank during that period of</text>
  <text start="365.11" dur="4.38">nearly three-quarters of a century</text>
  <text start="367.02" dur="4.42">monetary policies were carried out more</text>
  <text start="369.49" dur="4.95">or less according to the US Constitution</text>
  <text start="371.44" dur="5.22">only the Congress shall have the power</text>

  <text start="382.57" dur="7.11">Bank in 1913 President William Taft</text>
  <text start="385.27" dur="6.72">pledged to veto any legislation that</text>
  <text start="389.68" dur="4.35">included the formation of a private</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="3.23">central bank this was between 1909 and</text>
  <text start="394.03" dur="4.29">1913</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="6.4">soon after Woodrow Wilson replaced</text>

  <text start="401.62" dur="6.27">Reserve Bank was founded in December 23</text>
  <text start="404.05" dur="5.88">1913 thereby centralizing the power of</text>
  <text start="407.89" dur="4.89">the US banks into a privately-owned</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="6.21">entity that controlled interest rate</text>
  <text start="412.78" dur="7.17">money supply credit creation inflation</text>
  <text start="416.14" dur="7.53">and in a roundabout way employment which</text>
  <text start="419.95" dur="5.85">they really can control it could also</text>
  <text start="423.67" dur="5.13">lend money to the government and earn</text>
  <text start="425.8" dur="4.62">interest or a fee money that the</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="4.35">government could create free of charge</text>
  <text start="430.42" dur="5.31">this assured in the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="433.15" dur="4.59">gradual rise of national debt as the</text>
  <text start="435.73" dur="4.5">government henceforth relied more on</text>
  <text start="437.74" dur="4.71">borrowing from banks than self financing</text>
  <text start="440.23" dur="3.69">as it had done prior to granting the</text>
  <text start="442.45" dur="3.78">power of money creation to the private</text>
  <text start="443.92" dur="4.35">banking system three years</text>
  <text start="446.23" dur="6.63">after signing the Federal Reserve Act</text>
  <text start="448.27" dur="5.71">into law Wilson said the following I am</text>
  <text start="452.86" dur="5.26">most</text>
  <text start="453.98" dur="7.38">unhappy man I have unwittingly ruined my</text>
  <text start="458.12" dur="7.26">country a great industrial nation is</text>
  <text start="461.36" dur="7.26">controlled by its system of credit our</text>
  <text start="465.38" dur="6.81">system of credit is concentrated the</text>
  <text start="468.62" dur="7.11">growth of Ana nation therefore and all</text>
  <text start="472.19" dur="6.17">our activities are in the hands of a few</text>
  <text start="475.73" dur="5.25">men we have come to be one of the worst</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="4.48">ruled one of the most completely</text>
  <text start="480.98" dur="5.1">controlled and dominated governments in</text>
  <text start="482.84" dur="5.85">the civilized world no longer a</text>
  <text start="486.08" dur="5.58">government by free opinion no longer a</text>
  <text start="488.69" dur="5.49">government by conviction and the vote of</text>
  <text start="491.66" dur="4.95">the majority but a government by the</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="6.84">opinion and duress of a small group of</text>
  <text start="496.61" dur="7.47">dominant men and this is what we have</text>
  <text start="501.02" dur="6.36">today but it&amp;#39;s much much worse he</text>
  <text start="504.08" dur="7.53">started a chain reaction and the</text>
  <text start="507.38" dur="6.45">situation has gotten dire and we have to</text>
  <text start="511.61" dur="4.98">go back I mean Henry Ford said the</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="4.47">following it is well enough that people</text>
  <text start="516.59" dur="4.53">the nation do not understand our banking</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="5.13">and monetary system for if they did I</text>
  <text start="521.12" dur="5.85">believe there&amp;#39;d be a revolution before</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="7.14">tomorrow morning and Rothschild who are</text>
  <text start="526.97" dur="5.79">the main owners of the central bank said</text>
  <text start="530.57" dur="5.37">the following and give me control of a</text>
  <text start="532.76" dur="6.12">nation&amp;#39;s money supply and I care not who</text>
  <text start="535.94" dur="5.25">makes its laws because they understand</text>
  <text start="538.88" dur="6.39">once you have the ability to create</text>
  <text start="541.19" dur="6.15">currency and governments borrow this</text>
  <text start="545.27" dur="3.66">currency with interest attached you</text>
  <text start="547.34" dur="3.27">control them doesn&amp;#39;t matter what law</text>
  <text start="548.93" dur="4.77">they put into place it makes no</text>
  <text start="550.61" dur="6.06">difference because you hold the debt</text>
  <text start="553.7" dur="6.27">over their head there&amp;#39;s no law that they</text>
  <text start="556.67" dur="5.49">can pass except one where they remove</text>
  <text start="559.97" dur="5.19">the central bank but then again the</text>
  <text start="562.16" dur="5.13">central bank would ask for all that</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="4.71">money back here you owe us</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="4.44">you know this trillions of dollars you</text>
  <text start="569.87" dur="4.05">need to pay that back right now and this</text>
  <text start="571.73" dur="3.87">is why most governments will not enact</text>
  <text start="573.92" dur="4.92">that law so they&amp;#39;re really not worried</text>
  <text start="575.6" dur="5.22">about that and we could see from cue we</text>
  <text start="578.84" dur="4.38">can see by Andrew Jackson which is</text>
  <text start="580.82" dur="6.87">hanging on the wall of president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="7.59">office that the move is to get</text>
  <text start="587.69" dur="9.84">rid of the central bank to take it down</text>
  <text start="590.81" dur="11.69">and this is the only way to cut off the</text>
  <text start="597.53" dur="10.68">supply of currency to a corrupt system</text>
  <text start="602.5" dur="9.85">if the central bank stays in power the</text>
  <text start="608.21" dur="8.52">deep state will never disappear yes we</text>
  <text start="612.35" dur="6.42">can bring those to trial maybe some of</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="5.19">them will run maybe some will suicide</text>
  <text start="618.77" dur="6.6">themselves makes no difference what will</text>
  <text start="621.92" dur="10.26">happen is the system will become corrupt</text>
  <text start="625.37" dur="10.53">once again and the only way to stop this</text>
  <text start="632.18" dur="6.81">whole thing is to reset the system now</text>
  <text start="635.9" dur="6.66">Trump put forth these tariffs now this</text>
  <text start="638.99" dur="7.11">is just one stage of it basically what</text>
  <text start="642.56" dur="6.87">he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s forcing the hand of the</text>
  <text start="646.1" dur="5.67">central banking community they want</text>
  <text start="649.43" dur="5.82">governments the central banks to make</text>
  <text start="651.77" dur="6.72">their move next because what he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="655.25" dur="7.67">to do is he&amp;#39;s trying to maneuver and</text>
  <text start="658.49" dur="6.87">take control of the narrative while</text>
  <text start="662.92" dur="5.59">bringing down the system but he needs to</text>
  <text start="665.36" dur="7.17">make it look like it is the central bank</text>
  <text start="668.51" dur="6.75">and they&amp;#39;re going to do this and we</text>
  <text start="672.53" dur="3.18">could see the process is already in</text>
  <text start="675.26" dur="3.42">motion</text>
  <text start="675.71" dur="4.83">this is why Rand Paul is introducing</text>
  <text start="678.68" dur="4.47">audit the Fed because all of this is</text>
  <text start="680.54" dur="4.41">going to hit it once and you and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="683.15" dur="4.14">this is not going to be six years from</text>
  <text start="684.95" dur="7.02">now eight years from now this is going</text>
  <text start="687.29" dur="7.74">to happen within a couple of months to a</text>
  <text start="691.97" dur="7.05">year I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s gonna go much</text>
  <text start="695.03" dur="9.86">longer than that because time is ticking</text>
  <text start="699.02" dur="9.99">down and something has to be done before</text>
  <text start="704.89" dur="7.06">the four years are up and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="709.01" dur="4.35">about Trump&amp;#39;s four years because if he</text>
  <text start="711.95" dur="5.07">lets this go even further</text>
  <text start="713.36" dur="5.61">he has lost control completely so we see</text>
  <text start="717.02" dur="3.98">right now that they are making their</text>
  <text start="718.97" dur="4.94">move now</text>
  <text start="721" dur="5.37">need to start the process they need to</text>
  <text start="723.91" dur="6.15">break it down they need to do all of</text>
  <text start="726.37" dur="7.05">this now because if they don&amp;#39;t they will</text>
  <text start="730.06" dur="7.35">not gain control of the economic system</text>
  <text start="733.42" dur="5.7">and then the deep state if they just get</text>
  <text start="737.41" dur="4.62">rid of the deep state and the central</text>
  <text start="739.12" dur="5.22">bank still lives on nothing has been</text>
  <text start="742.03" dur="3.96">solved whatsoever yes there&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="744.34" dur="4.43">couple of people that stand trial or</text>
  <text start="745.99" dur="6.06">whatever happens but the whole system</text>
  <text start="748.77" dur="7.21">will still be intact the whole thing</text>
  <text start="752.05" dur="5.49">will be repeated once again and this is</text>
  <text start="755.98" dur="3.48">what we&amp;#39;re seeing and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="757.54" dur="4.17">watching being played out and this is</text>
  <text start="759.46" dur="5.07">why the central banks the IMF the Fed</text>

  <text start="777.49" dur="6.69">exactly what he wants them to do he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="780.76" dur="6.39">trapping them because he needs to turn</text>
  <text start="784.18" dur="6.81">the narrative on them on what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="787.15" dur="6.93">doing that they can&amp;#39;t fix or they can&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="831.19" dur="5.16">things happen during this period of time</text>
  <text start="833.14" dur="6.75">this is why he needs to maneuver and</text>
  <text start="836.35" dur="6.54">take the narrative and control the</text>
  <text start="839.89" dur="5.1">narrative and make sure that everyone is</text>
