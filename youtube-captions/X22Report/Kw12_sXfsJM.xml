  <text start="225.22" dur="7.889">that secondly the Patriots Trump his</text>
  <text start="230.38" dur="5.639">administration needed to show that the</text>

  <text start="236.019" dur="7.431">economy works no clue has no idea how</text>
  <text start="240.31" dur="7.53">the system works and if you don&amp;#39;t follow</text>
  <text start="243.45" dur="7.36">my economic system the economy will not</text>
  <text start="247.84" dur="4.53">grow and Trump has been saying we need</text>
  <text start="250.81" dur="5.429">to lower rates we need to lower rates</text>
  <text start="252.37" dur="7.2">and the Fed didn&amp;#39;t do it at first and</text>

  <text start="259.57" dur="5.73">Fed followed along all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="262" dur="6.78">markets shot up unemployment</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="6.57">unemployment kept dropping GDP numbers</text>

  <text start="280.96" dur="5.16">don&amp;#39;t have any idea what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="282.46" dur="6">Trump then showed the world how all</text>
  <text start="286.12" dur="3.69">other countries are continually lowering</text>
  <text start="288.46" dur="2.76">rates but here in the United States</text>
  <text start="289.81" dur="3.12">we&amp;#39;re not how we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="5.97">competitive it&amp;#39;s going to be absolutely</text>
  <text start="292.93" dur="4.77">impossible once again he was showing the</text>
  <text start="297.19" dur="4.05">people</text>
  <text start="297.7" dur="5.67">and Trump continually tweets out and</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="5.1">lets everyone know that his economic</text>
  <text start="303.37" dur="6.24">policies they are working statistically</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="6.63">of course we all know this this is part</text>
  <text start="309.61" dur="7.02">of the entire plan he tweeted out Nasdaq</text>

  <text start="352.99" dur="4.56">last much longer</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="6.06">Trump and the Patriots know this but</text>
  <text start="357.55" dur="5.4">Trump also understands is that to get</text>

  <text start="362.95" dur="7.62">embedded into our entire system our</text>
  <text start="367.75" dur="5.55">government and not just here in the I</text>
  <text start="370.57" dur="5.3">States but around the world you need to</text>
  <text start="373.3" dur="5.49">build a narrative and show the people</text>
  <text start="375.87" dur="4.36">that it&amp;#39;s the central bank that is a</text>
  <text start="378.79" dur="3.42">problem why do you think he continually</text>

  <text start="394.42" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re doing he&amp;#39;s doing this on purpose</text>
  <text start="397.83" dur="4.3">to let everyone know because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="412.69" dur="4.05">to think this we were made to think this</text>
  <text start="415.39" dur="4.74">because the mainstream media and the</text>
  <text start="416.74" dur="6.24">central banks have pushed this they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="420.13" dur="7.53">also made us think that precious metals</text>
  <text start="422.98" dur="8.97">that&amp;#39;s not money it&amp;#39;s only for jewelry</text>
  <text start="427.66" dur="6.18">even on CNBC they were out there and</text>

  <text start="461.2" dur="7.11">tweet confirmed what he&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="465.22" dur="5.03">here this is what he tweeted out at my</text>
  <text start="468.31" dur="4.98">meeting with Jay Powell this morning I</text>
  <text start="470.25" dur="5.38">protested fact that our Fed rate is set</text>
  <text start="473.29" dur="4.41">too high relative to the interest rates</text>
  <text start="475.63" dur="4.11">of other competitor countries in fact</text>

  <text start="483.16" dur="6">hurting manufacturers and growth and</text>
  <text start="486.54" dur="5.61">remember the other side of this is that</text>
  <text start="489.16" dur="7.8">he needs to bring back businesses</text>
  <text start="492.15" dur="9.64">manufacturing and he needs the Fed to</text>
  <text start="496.96" dur="9.41">work with him to cut the rates so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="501.79" dur="7.17">on an even playing field now the Fed</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="5.26">they&amp;#39;re kind of trapped in their own</text>
  <text start="508.96" dur="6.57">system because if they don&amp;#39;t follow</text>
  <text start="511.63" dur="7.98">along with Trump they&amp;#39;re going down a</text>
  <text start="515.53" dur="7.199">dead-end street because the economy will</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="5.04">then implode if the economy implodes and</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="5.191">they decide to do anything but what he</text>
  <text start="524.65" dur="8.19">is saying like keep rates at a steady</text>
  <text start="527.92" dur="6.26">rate or raise rates well all he has to</text>
  <text start="532.84" dur="4.35">do is turn around and blame them and</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="7.93">they don&amp;#39;t want that to happen the good</text>
  <text start="537.19" dur="7.98">guys yes the bad guys no so they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="5.46">following along yes they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>

  <text start="547.57" dur="3.57">whatever they possibly can they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="554.35" dur="6.419">Trump and the Patriots they control it</text>
  <text start="556.81" dur="6.42">all all they have to do is turn around</text>
  <text start="560.769" dur="5.151">and blame the Fed if they try to bring</text>
  <text start="563.23" dur="6.799">down the system before the elections</text>
  <text start="565.92" dur="7.63">well that&amp;#39;s crisis if we have a crisis</text>
