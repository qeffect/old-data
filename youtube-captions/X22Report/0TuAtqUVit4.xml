  <text start="61.149" dur="5.58">22nd 2017 and the title of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.03" dur="6.66">is the central bankers make their move</text>
  <text start="66.729" dur="6.241">to control all currencies let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="70.69" dur="5.789">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.97" dur="4.92">geopolitical news now as we can see the</text>
  <text start="76.479" dur="4.351">battle between</text>
  <text start="77.89" dur="4.409">Trump and the deep state it is being</text>
  <text start="80.83" dur="4.74">fought out in the open</text>
  <text start="82.299" dur="5.221">actually there is a coup against us it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="85.57" dur="4.89">a coordinated campaign</text>
  <text start="87.52" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s brazen it&amp;#39;s bold it&amp;#39;s insulting to</text>
  <text start="90.46" dur="5.34">our intelligence actually they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="93.52" dur="5.07">even trying to hide their lies anymore</text>
  <text start="95.8" dur="6.87">and truths well that&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="98.59" dur="7.47">irrelevant now to buy in on the media</text>
  <text start="102.67" dur="6.989">narrative on the latest Russian nonsense</text>
  <text start="106.06" dur="5.82">you must believe the following now just</text>
  <text start="109.659" dur="5.221">think about this for a second that</text>
  <text start="111.88" dur="5.7">whatever was revealed was super secret</text>
  <text start="114.88" dur="6.299">though we don&amp;#39;t know exactly what it was</text>
  <text start="117.58" dur="5.61">that random anonymous sources in an</text>
  <text start="121.179" dur="4.371">intelligence community that hates Trump</text>
  <text start="123.19" dur="5.489">with a burning passion must be believed</text>
  <text start="125.55" dur="5.97">without question though we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="128.679" dur="5.67">their identities or their motives that</text>
  <text start="131.52" dur="5.14">when the Washington Post and the rest of</text>
  <text start="134.349" dur="4.11">the media publishes classified stuff</text>
  <text start="136.66" dur="4.799">including intelligence provided by</text>
  <text start="138.459" dur="6.03">allies leaked by anyone not named Donald</text>
  <text start="141.459" dur="5.191">Trump well it&amp;#39;s completely awesome that</text>
  <text start="144.489" dur="4.47">the Washington Post and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="146.65" dur="4.65">media which has been wrong over and over</text>
  <text start="148.959" dur="6.241">again in the reporting are not wrong</text>
  <text start="151.3" dur="7.88">again this is what they want us to</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="8.55">believe and if you notice they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="159.18" dur="7.089">shown evidence ever they just keep going</text>
  <text start="163.75" dur="5.67">on and on and on about it and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="166.269" dur="6.181">way propaganda works spread it around on</text>
  <text start="169.42" dur="4.14">a lot of corporate media sites make it</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="3.42">look like it&amp;#39;s coming from different</text>
  <text start="173.56" dur="4.319">areas actually if it&amp;#39;s within the same</text>
  <text start="175.87" dur="3.869">corporate media like CNN pretend you</text>
  <text start="177.879" dur="3.721">have two different sources that are</text>
  <text start="179.739" dur="4.681">confirming the same exact thing but</text>
  <text start="181.6" dur="4.87">never reveal the sources and make it</text>
  <text start="184.42" dur="4.99">seem like that then is the true</text>
  <text start="186.47" dur="4.47">and make sure it shows up then on every</text>
  <text start="189.41" dur="3.18">other corporate media and keep repeating</text>
  <text start="190.94" dur="3.72">it and repeating it repeating until</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="6.57">everyone believes that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="194.66" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re doing right now why because they</text>
  <text start="199.16" dur="4.44">realize that they need to stay in</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="5.88">control of what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="203.6" dur="6.15">and they can&amp;#39;t figure out any way else</text>
  <text start="207.32" dur="5.34">of doing this because their whole goal</text>
  <text start="209.75" dur="6.98">is either have Trump join in with the</text>
  <text start="212.66" dur="6.42">deep state or he needs to be removed and</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="3.76">of course they&amp;#39;re not just going to come</text>
  <text start="219.08" dur="4.8">out and say hey we&amp;#39;re removing you</text>
  <text start="220.49" dur="6.6">that&amp;#39;d be ridiculous but they have to</text>
  <text start="223.88" dur="8.28">figure out a way to prove their case to</text>
  <text start="227.09" dur="8.28">make people doubt everything and this is</text>
  <text start="232.16" dur="6.59">what they&amp;#39;ve been doing this is why they</text>
  <text start="235.37" dur="5.9">wanted a special prosecutor investigator</text>
  <text start="238.75" dur="5.89">this is why they keep saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.27" dur="5.89">Russian collusion this is why they keep</text>
  <text start="244.64" dur="4.68">harping on Flynn to make the connection</text>
  <text start="247.16" dur="4.41">to Trump and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="249.32" dur="5.1">continually do this until the very on</text>
  <text start="251.57" dur="5.639">till the very end until they can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="254.42" dur="7.64">anymore and then they take it to the</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="7.291">next level and the next level is either</text>
  <text start="262.06" dur="3.94">forcing him to resign one way or another</text>
  <text start="264.5" dur="3.68">putting a lot of pressure on him or</text>
  <text start="266" dur="4.08">assassinating him and it looks like</text>
  <text start="268.18" dur="2.5">they&amp;#39;re prepared to do this because</text>
  <text start="270.08" dur="5.73">pence</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="9">well again he&amp;#39;s preparing a war chest</text>
  <text start="275.81" dur="6.57">for elections which is kind of odd at</text>
  <text start="279.68" dur="4.86">this point in time but we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="282.38" dur="5.52">watch this entire situation and see how</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="6.09">this plays out now the Seth rich plot</text>
  <text start="287.9" dur="6.03">well this is getting weirder and weirder</text>
  <text start="290.63" dur="7.11">as time goes on now we know that this</text>
  <text start="293.93" dur="5.28">wasn&amp;#39;t just a robbery because they shot</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="4.71">him in the back and they didn&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="299.21" dur="5.28">anything now Seth rich he was the</text>
  <text start="302.45" dur="4.65">WikiLeaks source for leaks which proved</text>
  <text start="304.49" dur="4.5">that the DNC was intentionally</text>
  <text start="307.1" dur="4.92">undermining the campaign of Bernie</text>
  <text start="308.99" dur="5.25">Sanders Julian Assange has already said</text>
  <text start="312.02" dur="4.649">yet yes that&amp;#39;s where we were getting our</text>
  <text start="314.24" dur="5.67">information now this is a problem</text>
  <text start="316.669" dur="5.341">because if this is absolutely true</text>
  <text start="319.91" dur="4.14">and the emails did come from Seth rich</text>
  <text start="322.01" dur="4.71">well what happens to the whole Russian</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="5.01">hacking thing that narrative is flushed</text>
  <text start="326.72" dur="5.64">down the toilet and the deep state</text>
  <text start="329.06" dur="5.31">realizes this and this is why you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="3.62">see it in the mainstream media this is</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="4.68">why they&amp;#39;re not reporting on this</text>
  <text start="335.98" dur="5.82">because this is not going to help their</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="6.03">situation actually their whole entire</text>
  <text start="341.8" dur="7">narrative of Russia collusion Russian</text>
  <text start="345.08" dur="7.16">hacking it completely falls apart now to</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="9">make things even more weird more strange</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="8.11">kim.com came out and said yes I confirm</text>
  <text start="357.8" dur="5.28">via Twitter that he was working with</text>
  <text start="360.35" dur="5.07">Seth rich to get leaked emails to</text>
  <text start="363.08" dur="4.5">WikiLeaks and he promised more</text>
  <text start="365.42" dur="5.4">information will be released on the</text>
  <text start="367.58" dur="5.88">interaction with Seth rich now the</text>
  <text start="370.82" dur="5.28">question is why didn&amp;#39;t he come out about</text>
  <text start="373.46" dur="5.19">this a lot earlier why did he wait until</text>
  <text start="376.1" dur="6.24">now maybe he waited for the story to</text>
  <text start="378.65" dur="5.79">break maybe he waited for information to</text>
  <text start="382.34" dur="4.74">come out we don&amp;#39;t know and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="384.44" dur="5.52">wait to see what he has now protesters</text>
  <text start="387.08" dur="6.03">were protesting out in front of Ajit</text>
  <text start="389.96" dur="6.48">PI&amp;#39;s office because Ajit PI he has a</text>
  <text start="393.11" dur="6.72">proposal to reverse Obama his net</text>
  <text start="396.44" dur="5.61">neutrality rules and protesters who had</text>
  <text start="399.83" dur="9.42">their faces covered held signs that read</text>
  <text start="402.05" dur="10.08">ban drug ban Breitbart we want net</text>
  <text start="409.25" dur="6.6">neutrality which is kind of weird in</text>
  <text start="412.13" dur="7.08">itself but we need to understand what</text>
  <text start="415.85" dur="5.52">this net neutrality is they&amp;#39;re making it</text>
  <text start="419.21" dur="4.32">seem like we want a free and open</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="3.87">Internet but the way they did this and</text>
  <text start="423.53" dur="4.139">where they classify it with the FCC</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="3.84">Obama was trying to make it a utility</text>
  <text start="427.669" dur="6.171">where they would have full control over</text>
  <text start="429.08" dur="7.08">it and Judicial Watch they made two</text>
  <text start="433.84" dur="4.24">requests under the Freedom of</text>
  <text start="436.16" dur="4.62">Information Act one of March 30th one on</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="6.06">April 4th where they wanted all the</text>
  <text start="440.78" dur="5.61">emails between Obama the FCC</text>
  <text start="444.14" dur="4.71">Commissioner employees and the rest of</text>
  <text start="446.39" dur="4.95">the group because they found something</text>
  <text start="448.85" dur="4.83">very interesting that really didn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="451.34" dur="4.799">any sense because the FCC</text>
  <text start="453.68" dur="5.459">they previously decided not to classify</text>
  <text start="456.139" dur="7.65">broadband internet as a telecom service</text>
  <text start="459.139" dur="8.37">and then on February 2015 well things</text>
  <text start="463.789" dur="6.66">change an Obama appointee controlled</text>
  <text start="467.509" dur="6.271">agency redefined broadband internet as</text>
  <text start="470.449" dur="5.521">falling under the 1930s public utility</text>
  <text start="473.78" dur="4.91">telephone statues so that it could</text>
  <text start="475.97" dur="6.38">impose its restrictive net neutrality</text>
  <text start="478.69" dur="6.49">regulatory rules on the Internet and</text>
  <text start="482.35" dur="9.069">this is what Judicial Watch is going</text>
  <text start="485.18" dur="9.75">after to see what Obama did to reverse</text>
  <text start="491.419" dur="5.641">this situation and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="494.93" dur="5.19">investigate this because something</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="5.94">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and we need to</text>
  <text start="500.12" dur="6.09">remember that the soros group they were</text>
  <text start="503" dur="4.53">behind the push for net neutrality and</text>
  <text start="506.21" dur="3.389">remember from all these groups from</text>
  <text start="507.53" dur="4.679">obama and the rest we need to remember</text>
  <text start="509.599" dur="3.75">they don&amp;#39;t want a free and open internet</text>
  <text start="512.209" dur="3.031">that&amp;#39;s not what they were trying to do</text>
  <text start="513.349" dur="4.081">they are trying to control it and of</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="4.679">course every time they put up a title</text>
  <text start="517.43" dur="5.099">like net neutrality it is always the</text>
  <text start="519.919" dur="5.881">opposite think of the Patriot Act think</text>
  <text start="522.529" dur="6.301">of the Affordable Care Act think of the</text>
  <text start="525.8" dur="4.71">USA Freedom Act all these things that</text>
  <text start="528.83" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;ve put out there with these type of</text>
  <text start="530.51" dur="6.36">titles it&amp;#39;s always the opposite now we</text>
  <text start="534.38" dur="5.49">know when Obama was president</text>
  <text start="536.87" dur="4.71">you dirty well he did not like Obama</text>
  <text start="539.87" dur="4.219">whatsoever he called them a lot of names</text>
  <text start="541.58" dur="5.58">and he said that he&amp;#39;d be pulling</text>
  <text start="544.089" dur="5.591">Phillipines business away from the u.s.</text>
  <text start="547.16" dur="5.369">moving it towards China and Russia and</text>
  <text start="549.68" dur="5.46">we see that the Philippine president</text>
  <text start="552.529" dur="5.721">Duterte well he is in Russia this week</text>
  <text start="555.14" dur="5.1">for a four-day official visit and</text>
  <text start="558.25" dur="4.48">basically they&amp;#39;ll be signing a lot of</text>
  <text start="560.24" dur="4.86">several a lot of bilateral agreements</text>
  <text start="562.73" dur="5.88">including the areas of Defense and</text>
  <text start="565.1" dur="5.34">securities and basically Russia is going</text>
  <text start="568.61" dur="5.25">to be supplying small arms light weapons</text>
  <text start="570.44" dur="5.49">airplanes helicopters submarines and it</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="3.719">looks like the Philippines and Russia</text>
  <text start="575.93" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re coming closer together at</text>
  <text start="577.579" dur="3.75">Philippines and China they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="579.32" dur="4.13">closer together and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="581.329" dur="4.441">going to be a problem for the deep State</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="3.67">remember their plan was to encircle</text>
  <text start="585.77" dur="4.53">China and</text>
  <text start="587.12" dur="4.92">that is falling apart right now because</text>
  <text start="590.3" dur="4.41">with the freedom of the freedom of</text>
  <text start="592.04" dur="5.64">navigation in the South China Sea that</text>
  <text start="594.71" dur="5.25">is coming to an end we see the Asin and</text>
  <text start="597.68" dur="4.409">the nations all around China there they</text>
  <text start="599.96" dur="4.89">have a formed an agreement where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="602.089" dur="5.161">all be using the South China Sea and all</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="5.28">that gigantic push to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="607.25" dur="5.7">China was trying to control the area and</text>
  <text start="610.13" dur="5.34">stop other ships from sailing into this</text>
  <text start="612.95" dur="4.889">area that is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="615.47" dur="4.47">right now and China has always said</text>
  <text start="617.839" dur="4.471">listen we would like to talk to all</text>
  <text start="619.94" dur="6.42">these nations but the United States they</text>
  <text start="622.31" dur="7.17">controlled all the nations and they kept</text>
  <text start="626.36" dur="5.64">them silent and things are now changing</text>
  <text start="629.48" dur="4.02">we see that North Korea well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632" dur="3.66">still firing their missiles which</text>
  <text start="633.5" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re not going to stop doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="635.66" dur="4.02">going to continually do this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="637.61" dur="3.93">trying to create a self-defense</text>
  <text start="639.68" dur="4.53">mechanism just in case the deep state</text>
  <text start="641.54" dur="4.77">wants to have regime change in North</text>
  <text start="644.21" dur="3.39">Korea and you really can&amp;#39;t blame them</text>
  <text start="646.31" dur="3.12">remember when they came out with the</text>
  <text start="647.6" dur="4.44">movie where it showed they were having</text>
  <text start="649.43" dur="5.099">regime change in North Korea they blamed</text>
  <text start="652.04" dur="4.44">North Korea on hacking the hacking of</text>
  <text start="654.529" dur="5.191">Sony when it really was a disgruntled</text>
  <text start="656.48" dur="6.63">employee and we see right now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="659.72" dur="6.03">been trying to provoke North Korea for a</text>
  <text start="663.11" dur="5.25">very long time and I&amp;#39;m not really</text>
  <text start="665.75" dur="4.23">surprised that North Korea is creating</text>
  <text start="668.36" dur="4.5">these type of weapons to defend itself</text>
  <text start="669.98" dur="4.47">and the UN of course stepped in now and</text>
  <text start="672.86" dur="3.84">United Nations on Monday called on North</text>
  <text start="674.45" dur="6.06">Korea to stop test firing ballistic</text>
  <text start="676.7" dur="5.52">missiles and we see that North Korea</text>
  <text start="680.51" dur="5.04">right now is saying that they&amp;#39;re open to</text>
  <text start="682.22" dur="6.09">dialogue with the United States Trump is</text>
  <text start="685.55" dur="5.97">saying yes we would be interested the</text>
  <text start="688.31" dur="5.64">South Korean president now is saying</text>
  <text start="691.52" dur="3.75">that yes we are interested and I think</text>
  <text start="693.95" dur="3.329">it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time before they</text>
  <text start="695.27" dur="4.83">all get together and North Korea says</text>
  <text start="697.279" dur="6.421">listen if we stop firing missiles will</text>
  <text start="700.1" dur="6.09">you stop the hostile provocative actions</text>
  <text start="703.7" dur="5.25">against our country and they might say</text>

  <text start="968.79" dur="5.54">were doing and eventually what happened</text>
  <text start="972" dur="5.94">is there were certain individuals</text>
  <text start="974.33" dur="5.35">whistleblowers in CENTCOM who came out</text>
  <text start="977.94" dur="3.75">and said okay we&amp;#39;ve been falsifying</text>

  <text start="985.22" dur="5.799">this is not true and yeah</text>
  <text start="988.499" dur="3.99">a report came out that US Central</text>

  <text start="996.299" dur="5.37">Islamic state simply was not effective</text>
  <text start="998.909" dur="4.89">that was a nice way of saying that we</text>
  <text start="1001.669" dur="6.21">were not actually going after the</text>
  <text start="1003.799" dur="7.89">Islamic state now Trump is not picking</text>

  <text start="1020.419" dur="8.25">these paid mercenary soldiers to cleanse</text>
  <text start="1025.1" dur="5.579">the area and again this is a slow</text>
  <text start="1028.669" dur="3.931">process this is not something that you</text>
  <text start="1030.679" dur="3.51">can just do because think about if all</text>
  <text start="1032.6" dur="3.929">of a sudden Trump came out and said</text>
  <text start="1034.189" dur="4.44">listen I know what the beep states up to</text>
  <text start="1036.529" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;m going to stop what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>

  <text start="1043.189" dur="4.291">all out on it well he did this with fake</text>
  <text start="1045.319" dur="4.171">news where he continually called the</text>
  <text start="1047.48" dur="3.96">corporate media fake news very fake news</text>
  <text start="1049.49" dur="4.139">and of course the corporate media fought</text>
  <text start="1051.44" dur="3.689">back and people actually made fun of</text>
  <text start="1053.629" dur="3.331">them and it was all over the corporate</text>
  <text start="1055.129" dur="3.331">media making fun of it yes we knew it</text>
  <text start="1056.96" dur="3.179">was fake news but there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="1058.46" dur="5.73">people out there saying that he&amp;#39;s crazy</text>
  <text start="1060.139" dur="6.091">and if he did try to do this the deep</text>
  <text start="1064.19" dur="4.88">state they would have created a major</text>
  <text start="1066.23" dur="5.22">event right off the bat he knew this</text>
  <text start="1069.07" dur="4.449">manis knew this many others knew this</text>
  <text start="1071.45" dur="3.599">that they would created this incredible</text>
  <text start="1073.519" dur="3.54">event that would have brought us into</text>
  <text start="1075.049" dur="3.781">war they would have collapsed the</text>
  <text start="1077.059" dur="4.08">economy at that point in time they would</text>
  <text start="1078.83" dur="3.929">have kept him so busy with riots with</text>
  <text start="1081.139" dur="4.321">what was going on around the world he</text>
  <text start="1082.759" dur="5.101">would have no time for anything so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1085.46" dur="4.439">using a different strategy and there is</text>
  <text start="1087.86" dur="4.35">an old saying that keep your friends</text>
  <text start="1089.899" dur="3.03">close and your enemies closer what does</text>
  <text start="1092.21" dur="3.449">this really mean</text>
  <text start="1092.929" dur="5.791">why would you keep you an enemy closer</text>
  <text start="1095.659" dur="6.421">than a friend well generally speaking</text>
  <text start="1098.72" dur="6.12">knowledge the closer an enemy is to you</text>
  <text start="1102.08" dur="5.01">the more intimately you will come to</text>
  <text start="1104.84" dur="3.48">know their capabilities you&amp;#39;ll know</text>
  <text start="1107.09" dur="3.929">their strengths their weaknesses their</text>
  <text start="1108.32" dur="5.64">tendencies you can use this knowledge to</text>
  <text start="1111.019" dur="5.28">your advantage so close enemy is also</text>
  <text start="1113.96" dur="5.64">one you&amp;#39;re privy to the whereabouts of</text>
  <text start="1116.299" dur="4.86">so you&amp;#39;re much less likely to be caught</text>
  <text start="1119.6" dur="4.199">off guard and if</text>
  <text start="1121.159" dur="5.85">listen to what sunsoo said with the art</text>

  <text start="1136.369" dur="7.56">enemy for every victory gained you will</text>
  <text start="1139.22" dur="6.809">also suffer a defeat so when we look at</text>
  <text start="1143.929" dur="4.83">what Trump is doing right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1146.029" dur="3.84">learning he&amp;#39;s understanding his enemy in</text>
  <text start="1148.759" dur="5.04">the beginning when he came into office</text>
  <text start="1149.869" dur="5.04">he didn&amp;#39;t understand he thought he could</text>
  <text start="1153.799" dur="2.97">work with the deep state</text>
  <text start="1154.909" dur="4.291">he thought wow all I have to do is</text>
  <text start="1156.769" dur="4.77">create these executive orders and maybe</text>
  <text start="1159.2" dur="3.809">I can bargain with them and everything</text>
  <text start="1161.539" dur="4.411">will turn out fine and he realized that</text>
  <text start="1163.009" dur="5.13">it will not work this way and now</text>
  <text start="1165.95" dur="3.599">everything is changed and now he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="1168.139" dur="4.47">a lot of the things behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="1169.549" dur="5.521">and we can see there is a battle that is</text>
  <text start="1172.609" dur="5.31">being waged in front of us and we</text>
  <text start="1175.07" dur="4.799">understand that this is going to</text>
  <text start="1177.919" dur="4.71">continue throughout the rest of this</text>
  <text start="1179.869" dur="5.67">year until the entire system crashes now</text>
  <text start="1182.629" dur="4.68">something very interesting the central</text>
  <text start="1185.539" dur="5">bankers the deep state remember they</text>
  <text start="1187.309" dur="5.94">need the US dollar because that is their</text>
  <text start="1190.539" dur="5.26">funding that is their control of other</text>
  <text start="1193.249" dur="5.701">countries and what we&amp;#39;re seeing after</text>
  <text start="1195.799" dur="5.161">this wanna cry ransomware we see that US</text>
  <text start="1198.95" dur="4.159">Congresswoman Kathleen Rice well she</text>
  <text start="1200.96" dur="5.76">introduced a bill and the bill is</text>
  <text start="1203.109" dur="6.461">tasking homeland security in conducting</text>

  <text start="1215.659" dur="6.51">assessment of terrorists use of virtual</text>
  <text start="1218.21" dur="7.86">currency Act was passed on May 18th so</text>

  <text start="1226.07" dur="6.059">wanna cry happened right during the same</text>
  <text start="1229.34" dur="5.699">period of time and if this bill is</text>
  <text start="1232.129" dur="4.86">passed into law well the assessment will</text>
  <text start="1235.039" dur="5.401">be completed within a hundred days of</text>
  <text start="1236.989" dur="5.461">the Act passing and then the results</text>
  <text start="1240.44" dur="3.869">would be shared with stake with US state</text>
  <text start="1242.45" dur="6.39">and local law enforcement agencies and</text>
  <text start="1244.309" dur="7.74">we need to understand that the central</text>
  <text start="1248.84" dur="6.01">bankers the deep state they need the</text>
  <text start="1252.049" dur="5.981">dollar because it allows them</text>

  <text start="1278.76" dur="6.54">cryptocurrencies well they are now</text>
  <text start="1281.37" dur="5.67">making a move and if this grows and</text>
  <text start="1285.3" dur="3.6">grows and grows and becomes more popular</text>
  <text start="1287.04" dur="3.12">this is going to be a problem for them</text>
  <text start="1288.9" dur="2.25">because it can be very difficult for</text>

  <text start="1294" dur="6.57">to get any bigger and we can see right</text>
  <text start="1297.63" dur="4.5">now that looking at the terrorists right</text>
