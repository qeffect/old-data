  <text start="37.29" dur="4.049">collapses bankers are taking measures to</text>
  <text start="39.12" dur="4.14">protect themselves and if we look around</text>
  <text start="41.339" dur="4.231">the world we look at the european</text>
  <text start="43.26" dur="4.02">nations we look at the united states we</text>
  <text start="45.57" dur="5.129">look at these central bankers what do we</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="7.26">see well we see a huge amount of debt in</text>
  <text start="50.699" dur="6.481">every single country we see balance</text>
  <text start="54.54" dur="5.97">sheets of the fed topping 4 trillion</text>

  <text start="65.7" dur="4.98">their way in the european nations to</text>
  <text start="68.31" dur="5.729">make sure that those individuals do not</text>
  <text start="70.68" dur="5.399">take out their cash from the banks</text>
  <text start="74.039" dur="4.26">because why would you keep your money in</text>
  <text start="76.079" dur="4.83">the bank if you&amp;#39;re getting negative</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="5.46">interest it makes no sense whatsoever at</text>

  <text start="83.759" dur="5.25">starting to scratch their head and say</text>
  <text start="85.53" dur="5.46">what is going on here and if we really</text>
  <text start="89.009" dur="3.511">look at this we see that other banks are</text>

  <text start="92.52" dur="5.37">America Chase Wells Fargo they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="100.38" dur="4.529">want to keep the money inside the United</text>
  <text start="102.509" dur="4.941">States we&amp;#39;re also seeing that Chase is</text>
  <text start="104.909" dur="5.941">going to charge customers a fee for</text>
  <text start="107.45" dur="5.589">depositing cash into the bank beginning</text>

  <text start="143.94" dur="5.76">cents on every 100 deposited so we can</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="4.44">see that these Spanx they are sitting</text>
  <text start="149.7" dur="3.69">here they are getting worried they</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="5.88">realize the interest rates are</text>
  <text start="153.39" dur="6.87">completely zero and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="157.47" dur="5.31">they are taking measures to protect</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="4.08">themselves and why else are they protect</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="5.82">them themselves well because they</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="7.35">realize the dollar is dying it is not</text>
  <text start="168.6" dur="4.77">doing well around the world many nations</text>
  <text start="171.69" dur="3.6">are starting to remove it from their</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="3.87">reserves and they&amp;#39;re ramping up on</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="3.81">different currencies or they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="177.24" dur="4.23">completely not trading in the dollar</text>
  <text start="179.1" dur="4.47">whatsoever and of course Russia China</text>
  <text start="181.47" dur="4.59">are definitely pushing this they are</text>
  <text start="183.57" dur="4.92">pushing nations by making deals with</text>
  <text start="186.06" dur="5.7">them to completely bypass the dollar as</text>
  <text start="188.49" dur="5.73">we know Russia right now and Gazprom</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="4.77">they are completely d dollar izing</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="3.69">themselves from the West they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="196.53" dur="4.14">to have anything to do with the dollar</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="4.38">they are taking precautions just in case</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="4.59">there are more sanctions on their way</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="7.23">and they&amp;#39;re looking for China to really</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="6.42">ramp up doing dealings with them not</text>
  <text start="209.52" dur="4.02">using the dollar whatsoever China has</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="3.45">been making deals all around the world</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="4.08">with bilateral trade agreements with</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="5.55">Australia New Zealand UK setting up</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="5.58">clearing houses and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="5.97">continually spreading all across the</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="6.81">world now we also see that China and</text>
  <text start="226.65" dur="6.27">Japan right now from June first 2014</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="4.35">from now on all transactions will be</text>
  <text start="232.92" dur="4.05">carried out between the two countries</text>
  <text start="234.36" dur="5.04">without converting national currencies</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="4.17">into dollars the Japanese yen and the</text>
  <text start="239.4" dur="3.27">Chinese yuan will be exchanged on</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="4.14">currency markets of Tokyo and Shanghai</text>
  <text start="242.67" dur="6.09">the worldwide dominance of the American</text>
  <text start="245.28" dur="7.2">greenback is slowly becoming history at</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="6.81">this time so what are we seeing we are</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="6.24">seeing many many nations protecting</text>
  <text start="255.57" dur="5.669">themselves by trading with other</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="4.68">currencies and as they reduced their</text>
  <text start="261.239" dur="3.991">reserves these dollars are going to flow</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="3.33">back to the United States and as these</text>
  <text start="265.23" dur="3.86">dollars flow back to the United States</text>
  <text start="266.73" dur="5.07">what happens the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="269.09" dur="5.05">completely devalue it is completely</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="2.82">devalued over time and then we see the</text>
  <text start="274.14" dur="2.76">rise</text>
  <text start="274.62" dur="4.28">of prices of on products and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.9" dur="4.61">seeing this already we&amp;#39;re seeing food</text>
  <text start="278.9" dur="5.89">increasing we&amp;#39;re seeing other products</text>
  <text start="281.51" dur="5.26">their prices going up and this is not</text>
  <text start="284.79" dur="4.8">going to stop and what&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="286.77" dur="5.31">ridiculous is that salaries are actually</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="4.799">going down so as prices of food and</text>
  <text start="292.08" dur="6.21">other products going are going up we see</text>
  <text start="294.389" dur="6.421">foo we see salaries are going down and</text>
  <text start="298.29" dur="4.32">not keeping pace with inflation and</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="4.169">especially those people who are</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="4.41">unemployed or underemployed they pretty</text>
  <text start="304.979" dur="3.781">much have no salary or they&amp;#39;re stagnant</text>
  <text start="307.02" dur="3.75">at this time and it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="308.76" dur="5.129">harder for them to make ends meet the</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="5.25">those older the older generation who are</text>
  <text start="313.889" dur="4.711">tired who are receiving their fixed</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="3.959">income they are seeing that this is</text>
  <text start="318.6" dur="3.36">becoming more and more difficult for</text>
  <text start="319.979" dur="3.511">them to make ends meet this is why</text>
  <text start="321.96" dur="3.329">they&amp;#39;re getting part-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="323.49" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re seeing that this is not even</text>
  <text start="325.289" dur="3.63">keeping up with inflation so some of</text>
  <text start="327.21" dur="6.269">these people are getting more than one</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="7.56">job to keep up with what is going on now</text>
  <text start="333.479" dur="5.821">we realize that the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="336.479" dur="4.291">need to keep this debt system going this</text>
  <text start="339.3" dur="3.63">is why they&amp;#39;re continually pushing the</text>
  <text start="340.77" dur="4.019">debt all across the world they need more</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="3.78">people to take on the dollar to</text>
  <text start="344.789" dur="4.891">continually prop it up they need more</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="5.459">people in the United States to to take</text>
  <text start="349.68" dur="3.93">on more and more debt and this is why</text>
  <text start="352.169" dur="5.881">they&amp;#39;ve lowered the standards for</text>
  <text start="353.61" dur="7.14">student loans if you are having problems</text>
  <text start="358.05" dur="4.92">with getting credit it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="360.75" dur="4.26">you can still get a student loan now</text>
  <text start="362.97" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re doing this in the car industry</text>
  <text start="365.01" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re also doing it in the housing</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="4.77">market they&amp;#39;re trying to get as many</text>
  <text start="368.94" dur="4.83">people into debt as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="371.4" dur="5.12">this is how the system survives and</text>
  <text start="373.77" dur="5.67">what&amp;#39;s very interesting right now is</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="5.92">that more and more people are taking on</text>
  <text start="379.44" dur="5.07">student loan debts to go back to school</text>
  <text start="382.44" dur="4.14">to get an education because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="3.96">promised after they&amp;#39;re finished with</text>
  <text start="386.58" dur="4.23">college they&amp;#39;re going to get this great</text>
  <text start="388.47" dur="6.06">fantastic job and what normally happens</text>
  <text start="390.81" dur="6.9">now in this market they can&amp;#39;t find that</text>
  <text start="394.53" dur="5.37">work what happens now is they graduate</text>
  <text start="397.71" dur="3.959">college they continually search for</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="4.199">these jobs and guess what there are</text>
  <text start="401.669" dur="4.141">really none out there now I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="404.099" dur="4.261">that everyone doesn&amp;#39;t get a job but</text>
  <text start="405.81" dur="3.75">eighty percent are having a problem</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="4.44">and they&amp;#39;re living with their parents</text>
  <text start="409.56" dur="6.24">and they&amp;#39;re not getting these full-time</text>
  <text start="412.8" dur="5.97">good-paying jobs and this is going to be</text>
  <text start="415.8" dur="6.089">a very big problem going forward because</text>
  <text start="418.77" dur="5.22">the youth of America is the foundation</text>
  <text start="421.889" dur="5.071">for the next generation this foundation</text>
  <text start="423.99" dur="6.63">this youth this segment of the market is</text>
  <text start="426.96" dur="5.31">in big big trouble because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="430.62" dur="3.359">getting the jobs they&amp;#39;re not saving the</text>
  <text start="432.27" dur="3.869">money they&amp;#39;re not buying new cars to get</text>
  <text start="433.979" dur="4.081">to their jobs they&amp;#39;re not going out and</text>
  <text start="436.139" dur="4.74">spending money in retail they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="438.06" dur="4.62">saving the money they&amp;#39;re not purchasing</text>
  <text start="440.879" dur="4.981">the homes and you can see this is going</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="6.419">to have an horrific effect going down</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="5.01">the line but don&amp;#39;t worry Obama was out</text>
  <text start="449.099" dur="4.261">there and he&amp;#39;s going to make it better</text>
  <text start="450.87" dur="5.49">for everybody he&amp;#39;s making it easier</text>
  <text start="453.36" dur="4.95">buying allowing people to defer payments</text>
  <text start="456.36" dur="5.64">to make it easier because they realize</text>
  <text start="458.31" dur="5.49">nobody has a job and they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="462" dur="4.289">work so what do they have to do they</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="4.799">have to make it easier for people to pay</text>
  <text start="466.289" dur="4.321">back their student loans and you have to</text>
  <text start="468.599" dur="4.5">start scratching your head going why are</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="5.07">so many people having problems paying</text>
  <text start="473.099" dur="5.401">back their student loans why are they in</text>
  <text start="475.68" dur="6.329">so much debt well the answer is because</text>
  <text start="478.5" dur="5.279">they can&amp;#39;t find good-paying jobs i mean</text>
  <text start="482.009" dur="5.13">we see these job numbers come out and</text>
  <text start="483.779" dur="6.901">most of them are temporary hospitality I</text>
  <text start="487.139" dur="5.611">mean my wife&amp;#39;s cousin graduated</text>
  <text start="490.68" dur="3.87">Binghamton looking around for jobs</text>
  <text start="492.75" dur="5.43">sending resumes out all over the place</text>

  <text start="498.18" dur="5.37">goes in for an interview and what is it</text>
  <text start="500.639" dur="6.541">it&amp;#39;s fourteen dollars an hour for 20</text>
  <text start="503.55" dur="6.329">hours this is the job he can get it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.18" dur="4.229">not even a full-time job so he has to</text>
  <text start="509.879" dur="3.811">live with his parents he has a lot of</text>
  <text start="511.409" dur="4.62">student loans he&amp;#39;s going to have to pay</text>
  <text start="513.69" dur="5.19">them back and he&amp;#39;ll live with his</text>
  <text start="516.029" dur="5.01">parents at this time and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="518.88" dur="4.68">happening too many many kids who are</text>
  <text start="521.039" dur="4.441">graduating college it&amp;#39;s getting more and</text>
  <text start="523.56" dur="5.37">more difficult for them to make it in</text>
  <text start="525.48" dur="6.75">today&amp;#39;s world and of course Obama you</text>
  <text start="528.93" dur="5.67">know he&amp;#39;s giving a live speech today and</text>
  <text start="532.23" dur="3.69">he went on to say that the the president</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="3.45">will sign an order directing the</text>
  <text start="535.92" dur="4.59">Secretary of Education to ensure that</text>
  <text start="538.05" dur="4.2">more students who board federal direct</text>
  <text start="540.51" dur="3.54">loans will be allowed to</text>
  <text start="542.25" dur="4.2">tap their loan payments at ten percent</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="5.49">of their monthly incomes many students</text>
  <text start="546.45" dur="6.18">who borrow who take out loans are</text>
  <text start="549.54" dur="4.86">working and trying responsibly to make</text>
  <text start="552.63" dur="3.84">their monthly payments but are</text>
  <text start="554.4" dur="5.43">nonetheless struggling with burdensome</text>
  <text start="556.47" dur="5.67">debt and the question again is where is</text>
  <text start="559.83" dur="5.13">all this debt why do they have all the</text>
  <text start="562.14" dur="5.61">set why don&amp;#39;t they have the income to</text>
  <text start="564.96" dur="5.39">pay back their student loans and the</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="5.4">question is because most of America is</text>
  <text start="570.35" dur="5.29">underemployed unemployed and those</text>
  <text start="573.15" dur="6.06">college graduates are having a very</text>
  <text start="575.64" dur="6.27">difficult time finding that high paying</text>
  <text start="579.21" dur="4.95">job in their major and they&amp;#39;re forced to</text>
  <text start="581.91" dur="4.26">take part time work just to make ends</text>
  <text start="584.16" dur="4.14">meet or they can&amp;#39;t even get the part</text>

  <text start="590.67" dur="5.22">want to hire you and this is what</text>
  <text start="592.35" dur="5.7">normally happens now we understand there</text>
  <text start="595.89" dur="4.92">was another mass shooting in las vegas</text>
  <text start="598.05" dur="4.83">and like i said there is the gun bill</text>
  <text start="600.81" dur="4.08">there is the UN arms treaty they are</text>
  <text start="602.88" dur="4.83">pending in the senate they&amp;#39;re waiting</text>
  <text start="604.89" dur="5.52">for a special event and if you really</text>
  <text start="607.71" dur="5.04">look back we have had mass shooting</text>
  <text start="610.41" dur="4.59">after mass shooting after mass shooting</text>
  <text start="612.75" dur="4.08">and it seems like and it&amp;#39;s a very short</text>
  <text start="615" dur="4.14">period of time and it seems like it</text>
  <text start="616.83" dur="4.89">always ends up in the same way where the</text>
  <text start="619.14" dur="5.64">shooter takes his own life they always</text>
  <text start="621.72" dur="6">end up dead and right now you can see</text>
  <text start="624.78" dur="7.16">this story starting to form they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="627.72" dur="8.85">trying to connect this las vegas shooter</text>

  <text start="720.48" dur="5.22">these type of different uh beauty or</text>
  <text start="723.3" dur="4.86">drug items they have cameras all in the</text>
  <text start="725.7" dur="4.62">ceilings monitoring everywhere so we</text>
  <text start="728.16" dur="4.53">should see some footage coming out about</text>
  <text start="730.32" dur="4.139">what actually happens and normally when</text>
  <text start="732.69" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s cameras we&amp;#39;d never see any</text>
  <text start="734.459" dur="5.491">footage but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="736.26" dur="6.24">is that the connection they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="739.95" dur="5.1">really push this now they&amp;#39;re showing</text>
  <text start="742.5" dur="5.16">video footage of this person Gerard</text>
  <text start="745.05" dur="4.5">Miller yes he was involved with the</text>
  <text start="747.66" dur="6.03">cliven Bundy ranch of course this</text>
  <text start="749.55" dur="6.45">happened in Nevada coincidence i think</text>
  <text start="753.69" dur="4.23">not i don&amp;#39;t believe in coincidences and</text>
  <text start="756" dur="4.079">again they haven&amp;#39;t filled on the site</text>
  <text start="757.92" dur="5.52">filmed on the side of the road talking</text>
  <text start="760.079" dur="5.461">to a reporter and the people who were</text>
  <text start="763.44" dur="4.23">handling the militia said they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="765.54" dur="5.16">let him join in and be on the Bundy</text>
  <text start="767.67" dur="5.37">ranch because he had an arrest record so</text>
  <text start="770.7" dur="4.02">they kind of shunned him away now of</text>
  <text start="773.04" dur="3.9">course the news crew found him on the</text>
  <text start="774.72" dur="4.53">road and interviewed him and made it</text>
  <text start="776.94" dur="5.1">seem like he was part of the militia</text>
  <text start="779.25" dur="4.589">when he really wasn&amp;#39;t so we can see how</text>
  <text start="782.04" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re trying to play this whole entire</text>
  <text start="783.839" dur="5.94">thing up at this time and of course it</text>
  <text start="786.54" dur="6.239">is kind of coincidental that it happened</text>
  <text start="789.779" dur="6.151">in Nevada very close to the Bundy ranch</text>
  <text start="792.779" dur="6.241">and who has to do who&amp;#39;s involved in this</text>
  <text start="795.93" dur="6.75">Harry Reid and you can see that it might</text>
  <text start="799.02" dur="5.91">could be kind of it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="802.68" dur="5.099">trying to revive this whole Bundy ranch</text>
  <text start="804.93" dur="4.04">thing once again while trying to go</text>
  <text start="807.779" dur="4.49">after</text>
  <text start="808.97" dur="5.429">and the guns at the same exact time and</text>
  <text start="812.269" dur="4.5">again if you look at the rant of jared</text>
  <text start="814.399" dur="4.101">miller he was on some type of medication</text>
  <text start="816.769" dur="5.221">of course that&amp;#39;s going to come out later</text>
  <text start="818.5" dur="6.31">and he was when in the time when he did</text>
  <text start="821.99" dur="5.43">is a facebook rant about the government</text>
  <text start="824.81" dur="5.339">and anti-government he was on house</text>
  <text start="827.42" dur="7.409">arrest for drugs or something like that</text>
  <text start="830.149" dur="7.62">and again they are trying to put a face</text>
  <text start="834.829" dur="5.43">on what a homegrown extremists looks</text>
  <text start="837.769" dur="4.32">like what a domestic terrorist looks</text>
  <text start="840.259" dur="4.351">like they&amp;#39;re trying to put a face on</text>
  <text start="842.089" dur="5.701">those people who are anti-government and</text>
  <text start="844.61" dur="4.769">this is their agenda at this time they</text>
  <text start="847.79" dur="6.799">have actually two agendas running</text>
  <text start="849.379" dur="8.911">simultaneously during this mass shooting</text>
  <text start="854.589" dur="6.49">now out in Indiana we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="858.29" dur="5.7">getting a new mine-resistant</text>
  <text start="861.079" dur="4.44">ambush-protected armored vehicle and of</text>
  <text start="863.99" dur="5.24">course we see this happening all across</text>
  <text start="865.519" dur="5.82">the United States many towns are getting</text>
  <text start="869.23" dur="4.409">uniforms they&amp;#39;re getting military</text>
  <text start="871.339" dur="4.651">assault rifles they&amp;#39;re getting these</text>
  <text start="873.639" dur="4.361">mine-resistant ambush-protected type of</text>
  <text start="875.99" dur="4.469">tanks they&amp;#39;re getting electronic</text>
  <text start="878" dur="5.699">surveillance equipment as long as they</text>
  <text start="880.459" dur="5.961">are in compliance with DHS they want the</text>
  <text start="883.699" dur="5.88">local police force to be completely</text>
  <text start="886.42" dur="4.899">militarized this is their agenda because</text>
  <text start="889.579" dur="5.221">they realize when this collapse comes</text>
  <text start="891.319" dur="5.671">and people start talking out against the</text>
  <text start="894.8" dur="3.779">government who are rioting because they</text>
  <text start="896.99" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t have food because the dollar is</text>
  <text start="898.579" dur="7.141">collapsing they need all of these police</text>
  <text start="901.79" dur="6.39">local law enforcement precincts in the</text>
  <text start="905.72" dur="5.429">towns and everywhere else to come into</text>
  <text start="908.18" dur="5.099">compliance and work with DHS to keep</text>
  <text start="911.149" dur="4.5">control of the people and to bring</text>
  <text start="913.279" dur="5.25">people to certain FEMA camps to make</text>
  <text start="915.649" dur="4.261">sure they confiscate weapons and this is</text>
  <text start="918.529" dur="3.151">why all this is happening but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="919.91" dur="3.539">very interesting out in Indiana they did</text>
  <text start="921.68" dur="4.409">get one of these tanks and of course</text>
  <text start="923.449" dur="7.411">when the sheriff was questioned about it</text>
  <text start="926.089" dur="9.72">he said that we need this because we are</text>
  <text start="930.86" dur="6.839">actually in a war zone really I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="935.809" dur="5.76">looking around the United States I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="937.699" dur="4.771">seeing the war zone and he he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="941.569" dur="3.001">there the</text>
  <text start="942.47" dur="4.89">saying that the United States of America</text>
  <text start="944.57" dur="4.62">has become a war zone he said there is</text>
  <text start="947.36" dur="3.87">violence in the workplace there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="949.19" dur="4.23">violence in schools and there&amp;#39;s violence</text>
  <text start="951.23" dur="3.75">in the streets you are seeing police</text>
  <text start="953.42" dur="4.23">departments going to semi-military</text>
  <text start="954.98" dur="5.04">format because of the threats we have to</text>
  <text start="957.65" dur="4.56">counteract if driving a military vehicle</text>
  <text start="960.02" dur="4.41">is going to protect officers then that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="962.21" dur="4.68">what I&amp;#39;m going to do so really the</text>
  <text start="964.43" dur="6.5">police office need a Mine Resistant</text>
  <text start="966.89" dur="6.9">ambush-protected tank in a town of</text>
  <text start="970.93" dur="5.86">13,000 does this make any sense</text>
  <text start="973.79" dur="6.39">whatsoever unless they are planning on</text>
  <text start="976.79" dur="6.3">something that&amp;#39;s going to go really bad</text>
  <text start="980.18" dur="6.09">down the line and this is exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="983.09" dur="5.37">happening now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="986.27" dur="3.57">United States passed the NDAA the</text>
  <text start="988.46" dur="2.64">president of course signs it in the</text>
  <text start="989.84" dur="3.57">middle of the night at the end of the</text>
  <text start="991.1" dur="4.35">year does this every single time to pass</text>
  <text start="993.41" dur="4.56">it when there&amp;#39;s no one around and now</text>
  <text start="995.45" dur="5.28">there is a new NDAA and you have to</text>
  <text start="997.97" dur="4.83">remember this NDAA allows the President</text>
  <text start="1000.73" dur="4.41">to say yes that person is a domestic</text>
  <text start="1002.8" dur="5.28">terrorist pick them up throw them in</text>
  <text start="1005.14" dur="5.19">jail without due process and they can</text>
  <text start="1008.08" dur="6.15">sit in that prison for one year and</text>
  <text start="1010.33" dur="7.26">there&amp;#39;s a new NDAA which has been</text>
  <text start="1014.23" dur="4.68">brought up by top senators and of course</text>
  <text start="1017.59" dur="2.82">they thought you wouldn&amp;#39;t notice they</text>
  <text start="1018.91" dur="2.97">did this behind closed doors and every</text>
  <text start="1020.41" dur="3.66">time they&amp;#39;re doing something that the</text>
  <text start="1021.88" dur="4.77">public wouldn&amp;#39;t agree with they always</text>
  <text start="1024.07" dur="4.98">do it behind closed door they wrote up a</text>
  <text start="1026.65" dur="4.62">new indefinite detention it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1029.05" dur="4.53">Guantanamo provision in the annual</text>
  <text start="1031.27" dur="4.32">defense policy bill and then they of</text>
  <text start="1033.58" dur="5.4">course they waited about 11 days to</text>
  <text start="1035.59" dur="6.69">quietly filed a bill so no one really</text>
  <text start="1038.98" dur="6.15">noticed what was going on now the new</text>
  <text start="1042.28" dur="4.65">bill says that detainees may be brought</text>
  <text start="1045.13" dur="4.41">to the United States for detention</text>
  <text start="1046.93" dur="5.1">pursuant to the authorization for use of</text>
  <text start="1049.54" dur="4.56">military force which means that the</text>
  <text start="1052.03" dur="5.16">policy of indefinite detention by the</text>
  <text start="1054.1" dur="6.93">military without charge or trial could</text>
  <text start="1057.19" dur="6.96">be carried out here at home and this</text>
  <text start="1061.03" dur="5.19">goes on to say that it tries to strip</text>
  <text start="1064.15" dur="4.59">the federal court of ability to decide</text>
  <text start="1066.22" dur="5.16">challenges to harmful conditions in a</text>
  <text start="1068.74" dur="4.41">stunning provision the Senate NDAA tries</text>
  <text start="1071.38" dur="4.2">to strip federal courts of their ability</text>
  <text start="1073.15" dur="3.029">to hear or consider any challenge</text>
  <text start="1075.58" dur="2.669">related to</text>
  <text start="1076.179" dur="3.75">harmful treatment or conditions by</text>
  <text start="1078.249" dur="4.14">detainees brought to the United States</text>
  <text start="1079.929" dur="4.5">this provision tries to gut our system</text>
  <text start="1082.389" dur="4.62">of checks and balances by cutting out</text>
  <text start="1084.429" dur="4.531">the court systems completely and of</text>
  <text start="1087.009" dur="4.02">course this is all being put into place</text>
  <text start="1088.96" dur="4.289">and we can see they have they put into</text>
  <text start="1091.029" dur="4.081">place the Patriot Act the NDAA they</text>
  <text start="1093.249" dur="4.56">continually modifying the NDAA where</text>
  <text start="1095.11" dur="4.439">they also allowed the United States</text>
  <text start="1097.809" dur="4.261">government is allowed to use propaganda</text>
  <text start="1099.549" dur="5.22">on the people that was in the latest</text>
  <text start="1102.07" dur="5.729">NDAA and they are continually doing this</text>
  <text start="1104.769" dur="5.25">on and on and on and the reason for this</text>
  <text start="1107.799" dur="5.25">is because they realized they will need</text>
  <text start="1110.019" dur="5.071">to maintain control of the people in the</text>
  <text start="1113.049" dur="3.63">United States they&amp;#39;re going to be those</text>
  <text start="1115.09" dur="3.719">people who do not agree with the</text>
  <text start="1116.679" dur="3.69">government they&amp;#39;re going to rise up</text>
  <text start="1118.809" dur="3.69">against the government there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1120.369" dur="4.471">be protests they want to push these</text>
  <text start="1122.499" dur="5.04">people down they want to round them up</text>
  <text start="1124.84" dur="4.949">take them and put them into prison and</text>
  <text start="1127.539" dur="4.47">say they are homegrown extremists their</text>
  <text start="1129.789" dur="3.781">domestic terrorists and they want to</text>
  <text start="1132.009" dur="3.961">take them and put them away of course</text>
  <text start="1133.57" dur="4.38">those people that are being placed on</text>
  <text start="1135.97" dur="3.48">list because of the NSA spying the</text>
  <text start="1137.95" dur="4.199">fusion centers they&amp;#39;re creating social</text>
  <text start="1139.45" dur="4.829">profiles on every single person they</text>
  <text start="1142.149" dur="4.711">will use their list to go after those</text>
  <text start="1144.279" dur="5.36">people and round those people up so all</text>
  <text start="1146.86" dur="6.509">of this is being done for a specific</text>
  <text start="1149.639" dur="5.351">purpose and like I said Eric Holder the</text>
  <text start="1153.369" dur="3.75">Department of Justice they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1154.99" dur="4.47">resurrecting that program to go after</text>
  <text start="1157.119" dur="4.56">domestic terrorists to find those</text>
  <text start="1159.46" dur="5.37">homegrown extremists and this is what</text>
  <text start="1161.679" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re doing right now and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1164.83" dur="5.9">saying is that they&amp;#39;re looking for those</text>
  <text start="1166.929" dur="7.11">people who have an anti-government or</text>
  <text start="1170.73" dur="5.559">racially prejudiced type of view and</text>
  <text start="1174.039" dur="4.23">these are the people that they want to</text>
  <text start="1176.289" dur="4.14">find these are the people they want to</text>
  <text start="1178.269" dur="4.62">get these are the people that they want</text>
  <text start="1180.429" dur="4.651">to put behind bars because these people</text>
  <text start="1182.889" dur="5.221">are going to be a problem to the system</text>
  <text start="1185.08" dur="4.679">and this goes on to say from Eric Holder</text>
  <text start="1188.11" dur="4.319">we must also concern ourselves with</text>
  <text start="1189.759" dur="4.8">continued danger we face from in from</text>
  <text start="1192.429" dur="4.08">individuals within our own borders who</text>
  <text start="1194.559" dur="5.281">may be motivated by a variety of other</text>
  <text start="1196.509" dur="6.061">causes from anti-government or racial</text>
  <text start="1199.84" dur="4.62">prejudice Holder said it appears there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1202.57" dur="3.929">an attempt to marginalize people who</text>
  <text start="1204.46" dur="3.449">hold views that are sharply different</text>
  <text start="1206.499" dur="3.421">from those of the administration and</text>
  <text start="1207.909" dur="4.291">much of the establishment so you</text>
  <text start="1209.92" dur="6.18">you do not agree with the government</text>
  <text start="1212.2" dur="6.9">they have a problem with you and of</text>
  <text start="1216.1" dur="5.7">course you can see that this is a huge</text>
  <text start="1219.1" dur="5.1">huge problem I mean of course this again</text>
  <text start="1221.8" dur="4.32">this looks like the SS coming out saying</text>
  <text start="1224.2" dur="4.62">here is the special task force I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1226.12" dur="6.18">waiting to see the uniforms with patches</text>
  <text start="1228.82" dur="6.51">you know and them in special garb to</text>
  <text start="1232.3" dur="5.7">come and take you away and myself</text>

  <text start="1852.64" dur="5.28">after victories of the syrian army so</text>
  <text start="1855.4" dur="5.91">he&amp;#39;s pretty much saying everyone is off</text>
  <text start="1857.92" dur="5.94">the hook come back home let&amp;#39;s stop all</text>
  <text start="1861.31" dur="4.2">of this and we have to remember those</text>
  <text start="1863.86" dur="5.19">chemical weapons the seven to eight</text>
  <text start="1865.51" dur="5.94">percent are still in Syria the United</text>

  <text start="1873.94" dur="2.969">France and the rest of the Western</text>
  <text start="1876.52" dur="2.279">private</text>
  <text start="1876.909" dur="5.311">central bank countries are trying to</text>
  <text start="1878.799" dur="7.23">make a case and trying to create this</text>
  <text start="1882.22" dur="6">illusion that Assad violated the treaty</text>
  <text start="1886.029" dur="4.5">this chemical weapon treaty and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1888.22" dur="3.539">trying to avoid it completely and this</text>
  <text start="1890.529" dur="2.85">is why they&amp;#39;re keeping the seven to</text>
  <text start="1891.759" dur="3.72">eight percent of these chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1893.379" dur="4.65">inside the country because if they can</text>
  <text start="1895.479" dur="3.961">prove that he used chlorine weapons on</text>
  <text start="1898.029" dur="4.08">his own people and on the paid</text>
  <text start="1899.44" dur="5.549">mercenaries then they have proof this</text>
  <text start="1902.109" dur="4.5">voids the contract the United States and</text>
  <text start="1904.989" dur="4.5">the rest of the countries can now invade</text>
  <text start="1906.609" dur="4.8">Syria and of course this is not going to</text>
  <text start="1909.489" dur="3.93">happen because Assad has not used it</text>
  <text start="1911.409" dur="5.94">France said already they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="1913.419" dur="5.37">troubles proving this and again this is</text>
  <text start="1917.349" dur="4.17">going to be a big problem because now</text>
  <text start="1918.789" dur="6.75">Assad is really making more moves and</text>
  <text start="1921.519" dur="7.41">saying that he&amp;#39;ll forgive these people</text>
  <text start="1925.539" dur="5.791">and just let&amp;#39;s all come back and just</text>
  <text start="1928.929" dur="5.25">live our lives and of course the United</text>
  <text start="1931.33" dur="5.159">States central bankers definitely do not</text>
  <text start="1934.179" dur="4.05">want this whatsoever now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1936.489" dur="5.55">interesting is that the western-backed</text>
  <text start="1938.229" dur="5.971">Syrian rebels are having quiet meetings</text>
  <text start="1942.039" dur="4.62">with Israel basically secret meetings</text>

  <text start="1958.21" dur="4.889">of figure out what is going on here</text>
  <text start="1959.849" dur="6.76">something is being planned because again</text>
  <text start="1963.099" dur="5.731">you do not move these military assets</text>
  <text start="1966.609" dur="4.351">into position you don&amp;#39;t have these</text>
  <text start="1968.83" dur="4.169">exercises with troops now running to</text>
  <text start="1970.96" dur="4.799">June tenth by the way which is tomorrow</text>
  <text start="1972.999" dur="4.26">and who does if this will go on a little</text>
  <text start="1975.759" dur="3.99">bit longer but it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="1977.259" dur="4.59">because they leave the military assets</text>
  <text start="1979.749" dur="5.16">in place and there&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="1981.849" dur="5.01">training they have more aid coming down</text>
  <text start="1984.909" dur="3.661">to the paid mercenaries and we</text>
  <text start="1986.859" dur="4.92">understand the United States has already</text>
  <text start="1988.57" dur="5.599">kicked out the Syrian government from</text>
  <text start="1991.779" dur="5.46">all the embassies sent them all home and</text>
  <text start="1994.169" dur="5.98">said that the opposition now is the</text>
  <text start="1997.239" dur="5.04">acting government of Syria and of course</text>
  <text start="2000.149" dur="3.9">the president we can&amp;#39;t forget he said</text>
  <text start="2002.279" dur="4.74">that Assad has absolutely no future</text>
  <text start="2004.049" dur="5.561">whatsoever in his own country and we can</text>
  <text start="2007.019" dur="5.441">see that something is going on it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2009.61" dur="4.59">way too quiet at this point and we are</text>
  <text start="2012.46" dur="2.849">definitely going to see some type of an</text>
  <text start="2014.2" dur="3.21">event occur and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="2015.309" dur="6.841">what&amp;#39;s coming up here there was an ad in</text>
  <text start="2017.41" dur="7.74">craigslist about getting crisis actors</text>
  <text start="2022.15" dur="6.029">for Atlanta this is coming up in the end</text>

  <text start="2051.73" dur="3.689">exempt from that so they were sent off</text>
  <text start="2053.44" dur="3.51">and we can see that something is</text>
  <text start="2055.419" dur="3.811">definitely in the works it is way too</text>
  <text start="2056.95" dur="4.919">quiet they&amp;#39;ve been building up the</text>
