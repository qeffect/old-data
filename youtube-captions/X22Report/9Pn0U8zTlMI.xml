  <text start="229.01" dur="8.339">nine point four million Americans are</text>
  <text start="232.299" dur="8.62">below the poverty line I mean think</text>

  <text start="240.919" dur="5.341">government the Fed and everyone else is</text>
  <text start="243.44" dur="5.76">telling us it&amp;#39;s so great we have nine</text>
  <text start="246.26" dur="9">point four million Americans below</text>
  <text start="249.2" dur="7.62">poverty something&amp;#39;s wrong here I mean</text>
  <text start="255.26" dur="3.24">things right now are getting worse than</text>
  <text start="256.82" dur="6.21">the pre-crisis levels for millions of</text>
  <text start="258.5" dur="8.669">the poorest Americans now the wealthiest</text>
  <text start="263.03" dur="6.359">ten percent of Americans have finally</text>
  <text start="267.169" dur="5.851">seen their household incomes rise about</text>
  <text start="269.389" dur="5.191">the levels last seen in 2007 it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="273.02" dur="3.81">true that the median incomes have</text>
  <text start="274.58" dur="5.309">recovered from the worst of the 2008</text>
  <text start="276.83" dur="4.83">disaster median earners were negative</text>
  <text start="279.889" dur="4.351">eight point one percent worse off in</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="4.59">2011 and now they&amp;#39;re only six point</text>
  <text start="284.24" dur="4.02">negative six point five percent worse</text>
  <text start="286.25" dur="4.949">off according to most recent data for</text>
  <text start="288.26" dur="4.92">2014 now of course as we&amp;#39;ve seen 2015</text>
  <text start="291.199" dur="3.15">this number is not going to hold up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.18" dur="3.69">actually going to be much much worse</text>
  <text start="294.349" dur="3.841">however when we look at the lowest ten</text>
  <text start="296.87" dur="4.32">percent of income earners</text>
  <text start="298.19" dur="5.64">this situation is much more precarious</text>
  <text start="301.19" dur="5.04">in 2011 the bottom ten percent of</text>
  <text start="303.83" dur="4.59">households were negative nine percent</text>
  <text start="306.23" dur="4.59">worse off in terms of income than they</text>
  <text start="308.42" dur="4.68">were pre crisis since then it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="310.82" dur="6.57">gotten any better now it&amp;#39;s negative</text>
  <text start="313.1" dur="8.13">eleven point six percent what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="317.39" dur="9.51">difference between 2007 2008 and today</text>
  <text start="321.23" dur="9.75">well there&amp;#39;s one huge difference the</text>
  <text start="326.9" dur="9.3">fed&amp;#39;s balance sheet has exploded to 3.5</text>
  <text start="330.98" dur="9.8">trillion of pretend money pretend</text>
  <text start="336.2" dur="8.31">currency and when we look at all of this</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="8.02">we see that yes the wealthier the higher</text>
  <text start="344.51" dur="7.71">earners making more right now the middle</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="6.81">the lower class not so much but this is</text>
  <text start="352.22" dur="6.39">all going to come to an end just like it</text>
  <text start="355.61" dur="5.1">did in 2008 I remember there was a</text>
  <text start="358.61" dur="5.19">certain area in New York where I used to</text>
  <text start="360.71" dur="7.82">live and it was very wealthy well-to-do</text>
  <text start="363.8" dur="9.03">I didn&amp;#39;t live there and when 2008 hit</text>
  <text start="368.53" dur="7.69">the entire place cleared out most of the</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="6.33">people they lost their wealth a lot of</text>
  <text start="376.22" dur="7.53">foreclosures lot of short sales and that</text>
  <text start="379.16" dur="6.72">area never recovered the population of</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="4.68">the school district kept on shrinking</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="6.51">and shrinking and shrinking today it is</text>
  <text start="388.43" dur="7.98">tiny and we&amp;#39;re going to see this happen</text>
  <text start="392.39" dur="6.23">once again we know that the Richmond New</text>
  <text start="396.41" dur="5.19">York Philly Chicago and Kansas City fed</text>
  <text start="398.62" dur="8.41">all flashing red signals at us well</text>
  <text start="401.6" dur="7.89">Dallas right now they contracted for the</text>
  <text start="407.03" dur="4.77">ninth month in a row things don&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="409.49" dur="5.85">good the Fed printed at negative nine</text>
  <text start="411.8" dur="7.05">point five and we&amp;#39;re seeing a disaster</text>
  <text start="415.34" dur="4.86">in wages employees contracting</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="6.6">drastically an average workweek</text>
  <text start="420.2" dur="8.88">collapsing so we&amp;#39;re hearing from all the</text>
  <text start="425.45" dur="6.21">feds around the country all of them are</text>
  <text start="429.08" dur="5.94">contracting nothing</text>
  <text start="431.66" dur="7.2">good at this point and as time goes on</text>
  <text start="435.02" dur="8.01">it&amp;#39;s just getting worse I mean all these</text>
  <text start="438.86" dur="8.19">indicators are flashing red signal</text>
  <text start="443.03" dur="7.38">saying yeah a collapse is coming now in</text>
  <text start="447.05" dur="8.04">the housing market they threw at us that</text>
  <text start="450.41" dur="6.45">new home construction surged now of</text>
  <text start="455.09" dur="4.41">course lumber prices lumber dependence</text>
  <text start="456.86" dur="4.23">going down but construction is going up</text>
  <text start="459.5" dur="3.03">and when we look at stores like home</text>
  <text start="461.09" dur="3.51">improvement stores furniture stores</text>
  <text start="462.53" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re seeing negative sales so some</text>
  <text start="464.6" dur="5.97">there&amp;#39;s a disconnect here and then we</text>
  <text start="466.43" dur="6.63">look at pending home sales a national</text>
  <text start="470.57" dur="5.13">association of realtors reported that</text>
  <text start="473.06" dur="4.82">August pending home sales dropped by</text>
  <text start="475.7" dur="5.85">negative one point four percent on</text>
  <text start="477.88" dur="8.71">expectations of a positive point four</text>
  <text start="481.55" dur="6.57">percent well what&amp;#39;s going on here well</text>
  <text start="486.59" dur="3.36">we know the Chinese are backing off</text>
  <text start="488.12" dur="4.02">right now because we can see the</text>
  <text start="489.95" dur="5.13">economies around the world they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="492.14" dur="6.33">hanging on at this point but don&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="495.08" dur="6.03">this fool you remember after the war in</text>
  <text start="498.47" dur="5.28">World War two what was the only country</text>
  <text start="501.11" dur="6.09">that pretty much had manufacturing and</text>
  <text start="503.75" dur="6.45">was capable of manufacturing on it was</text>
  <text start="507.2" dur="6.019">the United States what country right now</text>
  <text start="510.2" dur="6.42">has the capability of manufacturing if</text>
  <text start="513.219" dur="6.641">things go south and we need to restart</text>
  <text start="516.62" dur="5.22">the system china china has been</text>
  <text start="519.86" dur="5.64">accumulating a lot of gold the United</text>
  <text start="521.84" dur="5.73">States probably has no gold most of the</text>
  <text start="525.5" dur="6.42">reports are showing us that there is no</text>
  <text start="527.57" dur="7.11">gold so we are seeing that pending home</text>
  <text start="531.92" dur="4.7">sales are dropping they gave us these</text>
  <text start="534.68" dur="3.81">fake numbers that new construction is</text>
  <text start="536.62" dur="4.03">surging and of course they&amp;#39;ll revise</text>

  <text start="540.65" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;ll say oh yeah those contracts they</text>
  <text start="542.81" dur="3.6">disappeared and we&amp;#39;ll bring the number</text>
  <text start="544.67" dur="3.6">right back down this is what they do</text>
  <text start="546.41" dur="6.26">every single time but no one looks</text>

  <text start="913.07" dur="8.76">the economy is not growing whatsoever I</text>

  <text start="942.53" dur="6.48">forward today September 2015 the same</text>
  <text start="946.55" dur="5.73">question keeps popping back up in fact</text>
  <text start="949.01" dur="6.15">since 2013 the economic slowdown has</text>
  <text start="952.28" dur="5.58">only grown more acute manifesting itself</text>
  <text start="955.16" dur="6.69">in last week&amp;#39;s failure by the Fed to</text>

  <text start="961.85" dur="4.89">nothing with the US economy is as strong</text>

  <text start="977.6" dur="8.22">2015 they&amp;#39;re still saying the same exact</text>
  <text start="980.93" dur="7.17">thing so something&amp;#39;s way off here either</text>
  <text start="985.82" dur="4.11">the unemployment data is very much wrong</text>
  <text start="988.1" dur="7.38">and the real unemployment rate is much</text>
  <text start="989.93" dur="7.05">much higher or maybe the GDP calculation</text>
  <text start="995.48" dur="5.97">is incorrect and the economy is growing</text>
  <text start="996.98" dur="6.24">at a four percent plus rate we almost</text>
  <text start="1001.45" dur="3.21">hit it at three point nine when they</text>

  <text start="1007.839" dur="10.201">economy is not growing anywhere near</text>
  <text start="1010.42" dur="10.919">four percent so one must take all this</text>
  <text start="1018.04" dur="5.149">data and say well it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1021.339" dur="4.5">completely manipulating the numbers</text>

  <text start="1030.1" dur="5.099">numbers and there&amp;#39;s a scarier</text>
  <text start="1032.62" dur="4.319">implication is that in addition to all</text>

  <text start="1053.76" dur="5.62">cash discrepancy could only be answered</text>
  <text start="1056.83" dur="5.22">is somehow the Fed is found to be</text>
  <text start="1059.38" dur="9.09">parking cash directly into the Treasury</text>
  <text start="1062.05" dur="7.89">secret basement so how can this be</text>
  <text start="1068.47" dur="3.51">because if they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="1069.94" dur="5.46">unemployment is down to 5.1 percent and</text>
  <text start="1071.98" dur="4.86">we know for a fact that all these jobs</text>
  <text start="1075.4" dur="4.5">that are being added are pretty much</text>
  <text start="1076.84" dur="5.01">low-paying part-time jobs how do they</text>
  <text start="1079.9" dur="4.97">have the revenue coming into the</text>
  <text start="1081.85" dur="9.06">government think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="1084.87" dur="9.16">why is housing not improving and when I</text>
  <text start="1090.91" dur="4.71">say that I mean the people of the United</text>

  <text start="1180.94" dur="5.67">revise their numbers except for the</text>
  <text start="1183.1" dur="6.54">United States where we saw them kind of</text>
  <text start="1186.61" dur="5.01">bring in consumer spending into the</text>
  <text start="1189.64" dur="4.74">second quarter GDP to push it up to a</text>

  <text start="1202" dur="4.62">this GDP number this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1206.62" dur="8.22">of this is not going to make sense</text>
  <text start="1209.05" dur="10.37">whatsoever we see China might be</text>
  <text start="1214.84" dur="14.17">bringing in gold from London covertly</text>
  <text start="1219.42" dur="13.81">about 1747 tons of gold so</text>
  <text start="1229.01" dur="6.66">at this point we see that china is</text>
  <text start="1233.23" dur="8.62">trying to get as much gold as they</text>
  <text start="1235.67" dur="8.43">possibly can and as China brings this in</text>
  <text start="1241.85" dur="4.14">I don&amp;#39;t really think they care where it</text>
  <text start="1244.1" dur="4.4">comes from as long as they can get their</text>

  <text start="1248.5" dur="5.86">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="1251.39" dur="7.74">that&amp;#39;s moving into China is not going</text>
  <text start="1254.36" dur="6.36">through the exchanges if the gold is for</text>
  <text start="1259.13" dur="4.26">the government they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>

  <text start="1265.67" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s heading if you look at the way</text>
  <text start="1268.01" dur="7.23">China does things they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="1271.55" dur="7.05">tell you so at this point when we look</text>
  <text start="1275.24" dur="5.61">at the holdings of London because if we</text>
  <text start="1278.6" dur="4.62">go back to 2011 not more than nine</text>
  <text start="1280.85" dur="4.65">hundred ninety seven tons of non marant</text>
  <text start="1283.22" dur="4.01">non monetary gold has left the UK</text>
  <text start="1285.5" dur="4.89">according to official trade statistics</text>
  <text start="1287.23" dur="4.78">Nick Laird notice that although the</text>
  <text start="1290.39" dur="5.4">total amount of physical gold in London</text>
  <text start="1292.01" dur="9.27">fell roughly around 2744 tons over four</text>
  <text start="1295.79" dur="9.36">years only 997 tons were net exported as</text>
  <text start="1301.28" dur="8.1">non monetary gold this makes everyone</text>
  <text start="1305.15" dur="9.98">wonder where the residual 1747 tonnes</text>
  <text start="1309.38" dur="12.5">went and most likely it went from UK</text>
  <text start="1315.13" dur="12.61">into China and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="1321.88" dur="9.76">that Russia China India and other</text>
  <text start="1327.74" dur="6.33">nations are trying to amass as much gold</text>

  <text start="1334.07" dur="3.96">the system comes down the nations that</text>
  <text start="1336.23" dur="5.33">have the gold the nations that have the</text>

  <text start="1341.56" dur="7.18">if you look back in World War two the</text>

  <text start="1359.54" dur="7.85">gold was sent over here and the system</text>
  <text start="1362.45" dur="8.34">was restarted China and Russia they</text>
  <text start="1367.39" dur="8.23">understand this and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1370.79" dur="8.07">continually accumulating gold at this</text>
  <text start="1375.62" dur="6.05">point now we all understand that gold is</text>
