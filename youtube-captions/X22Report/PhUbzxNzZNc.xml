  <text start="69.68" dur="4.579">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at a lot of economic</text>
  <text start="71.75" dur="5.1">indicators and they&amp;#39;re all pointing down</text>
  <text start="74.259" dur="4.621">none of it is showing us that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="76.85" dur="3.51">any type of recovery but so far and</text>
  <text start="78.88" dur="3.97">everything that we looked at</text>
  <text start="80.36" dur="4.14">manufacturing when we looked at retail</text>
  <text start="82.85" dur="3.84">when we looked at housing when we look</text>
  <text start="84.5" dur="6.3">at unemployment we are showing that</text>
  <text start="86.69" dur="5.73">things are deteriorating quickly and if</text>
  <text start="90.8" dur="4.02">we look at the philly fed it is</text>
  <text start="92.42" dur="5.519">collapsed to a negative five point nine</text>
  <text start="94.82" dur="5.97">percent missing their expectations of a</text>
  <text start="97.939" dur="5.371">positive one and hitting its lowest</text>
  <text start="100.79" dur="7.68">level since februari of 2013 new orders</text>
  <text start="103.31" dur="8.19">have created two three year lows so when</text>
  <text start="108.47" dur="6.63">we look at this entire situation nothing</text>
  <text start="111.5" dur="5.4">has changed at this point even though</text>
  <text start="115.1" dur="5.4">the Fed made its announcement and we</text>
  <text start="116.9" dur="6.84">know the market rallied up to 200 plus</text>
  <text start="120.5" dur="5.579">points or so well today it&amp;#39;s down 200</text>
  <text start="123.74" dur="6.239">plus points so nothing has been gained</text>
  <text start="126.079" dur="6.241">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the corporate</text>
  <text start="129.979" dur="5.881">media the US government all clapping</text>
  <text start="132.32" dur="6.63">their hands they&amp;#39;ve done it we are in a</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="5.55">recovery everything is settled we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="4.08">heard that before and everything is</text>
  <text start="141.41" dur="3.09">going to go smoothly but we have to</text>
  <text start="143.03" dur="4.769">remember we&amp;#39;re going into an election</text>
  <text start="144.5" dur="5.16">year in 2016 and during an election year</text>
  <text start="147.799" dur="3.841">they&amp;#39;re going to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="149.66" dur="4.29">possibly can to make it look like</text>
  <text start="151.64" dur="5.46">everything is absolutely fine we saw</text>
  <text start="153.95" dur="6.21">this in 2008 until the very end right</text>
  <text start="157.1" dur="4.8">before the elections and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="160.16" dur="3.24">see the same thing happen once again</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="2.55">they&amp;#39;re going to lower the unemployment</text>
  <text start="163.4" dur="5.07">rate we&amp;#39;ll prob</text>
  <text start="164.45" dur="6.21">get into the four is 4.8 4.9 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.47" dur="5.28">going to continually tell everyone how</text>
  <text start="170.66" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re in this incredible recovery that</text>
  <text start="173.75" dur="5.22">we went from 2008 we created all these</text>
  <text start="176.51" dur="4.68">jobs which there were no jobs created</text>
  <text start="178.97" dur="4.47">actually we lost millions of people in</text>
  <text start="181.19" dur="4.17">manufacturing and they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="183.44" dur="6.36">to convince us that the central banking</text>
  <text start="185.36" dur="6.9">system has created all of this currency</text>
  <text start="189.8" dur="4.409">brought us into recovery and now raise</text>
  <text start="192.26" dur="4.83">the Fed fund rate by a quarter</text>
  <text start="194.209" dur="5.371">percentage hara hara we are in a</text>
  <text start="197.09" dur="5.52">recovery now this is all part of their</text>
  <text start="199.58" dur="5.189">major illusion and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="202.61" dur="4.379">interesting is that the bloomberg</text>
  <text start="204.769" dur="4.591">consumer comfort survey found that</text>
  <text start="206.989" dur="4.201">sixty-nine percent of the people had a</text>
  <text start="209.36" dur="8.43">negative view of the state of the</text>
  <text start="211.19" dur="8.22">economy and when you look at when people</text>
  <text start="217.79" dur="2.96">were looking at the economy saying okay</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="8.639">it&amp;#39;s good it&amp;#39;s bad and things like that</text>
  <text start="220.75" dur="9.01">there were times during 2015 where the</text>
  <text start="228.049" dur="4.141">state of the economy was much higher</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="4.86">than it is today and the feds said</text>
  <text start="232.19" dur="5.34">absolutely no we&amp;#39;re not going to raise</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="6.63">the rates the Fed decided to raise the</text>
  <text start="237.53" dur="7.17">Fed fund rate at the lowest point of the</text>
  <text start="241.25" dur="7.56">economy which is kind of strange at this</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="9.15">time and the question is why did they do</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="7.799">it right now because what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="253.85" dur="5.55">around the world what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="5.37">in the United States they realize that</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="5.16">they cannot push this economy forward</text>
  <text start="261.979" dur="4.681">any longer it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="264.56" dur="4.43">harder their statistical numbers don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="266.66" dur="5.4">even match up to the real economic</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="4.27">indicators anymore they&amp;#39;re so far apart</text>
  <text start="272.06" dur="3.81">because everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="273.26" dur="5.219">discussing makes no sense from what they</text>
  <text start="275.87" dur="5.07">are saying and Paul Craig Roberts is out</text>
  <text start="278.479" dur="6.151">there saying what does the rate hike</text>
  <text start="280.94" dur="6">really mean and he wanted to say that it</text>
  <text start="284.63" dur="4.44">means that the Fed has had time to</text>
  <text start="286.94" dur="5.07">figure out that the effect of this small</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="5.19">rate hike would essentially be zero in</text>
  <text start="292.01" dur="5.52">other words the small increases in the</text>
  <text start="294.26" dur="4.73">target rate from a range of 0 2.25</text>
  <text start="297.53" dur="7.44">percent</text>
  <text start="298.99" dur="10.42">2.25 % 2.5 2.50 percent is insufficient</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="9.35">to set off any problems in the</text>
  <text start="309.41" dur="9.15">derivative market stocks bonds housing</text>
  <text start="314.32" dur="6.04">but we knew this we knew that this</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="7.94">wasn&amp;#39;t really going to have an effect</text>
  <text start="320.36" dur="9.63">and the question is why did they do it</text>
  <text start="326.5" dur="5.05">they had to do it because the world was</text>
  <text start="329.99" dur="3.75">looking at the central bank remember</text>
  <text start="331.55" dur="5.33">when i said the central bank does not</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="5.67">want to be blamed for this collapse</text>
  <text start="336.88" dur="4.27">because the central bank wants to rule</text>
  <text start="339.41" dur="3.75">the world once again and start the</text>
  <text start="341.15" dur="3.87">system completely over and if people</text>
  <text start="343.16" dur="3.69">catch on that it&amp;#39;s the central bank</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s causing all these problems this</text>
  <text start="346.85" dur="3.629">wouldn&amp;#39;t be possible so they had to</text>
  <text start="349.01" dur="3.719">convince everyone and bring everyone</text>
  <text start="350.479" dur="4.41">into this illusionary world that we are</text>
  <text start="352.729" dur="4.291">in a recovery and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="354.889" dur="4.741">they just did this is a signal to</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="6.09">everyone that the next phase of this</text>
  <text start="359.63" dur="4.59">collapse has begun because now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="363.11" dur="3.21">at the point where they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="364.22" dur="3.93">to raise it again and as they</text>
  <text start="366.32" dur="5.219">continually raise it this is going to be</text>
  <text start="368.15" dur="6.21">troublesome and they know this and this</text>
  <text start="371.539" dur="4.741">is why we need to be prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="374.36" dur="4.23">because they&amp;#39;re ready to bring home this</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="4.29">event but Paul Craig Roberts went on to</text>
  <text start="378.59" dur="6.09">say that the purpose of raising interest</text>
  <text start="380.57" dur="6.33">rates is the choke off credit demand but</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="5.299">there was no need to choke off credit to</text>
  <text start="386.9" dur="8.25">man because it was no demand for credit</text>
  <text start="389.979" dur="6.91">and basically what he&amp;#39;s saying is that</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="5.1">this whole rate hike is a complete fraud</text>
  <text start="396.889" dur="6.721">the banking system as a whole does not</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="6.84">need to borrow add as it is sitting on</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="5.66">about 2.4 2 trillion in excess reserves</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="5.85">the negative impact of the rate hike</text>
  <text start="409.27" dur="6.88">effects really only smaller banks that</text>
  <text start="412.94" dur="6.3">are lending to consumers to other</text>
  <text start="416.15" dur="5.55">businesses now if these banks find</text>
  <text start="419.24" dur="4.14">themselves fully loaned up and in need</text>
  <text start="421.7" dur="3.39">of overnight reserves to meet their</text>
  <text start="423.38" dur="4.71">reserve requirement they will need to</text>
  <text start="425.09" dur="4.71">borrow from a bank with excess reserves</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="4.14">thus the rate hike has the effect of</text>
  <text start="429.8" dur="5.34">making smaller banks pay higher interest</text>
  <text start="432.23" dur="5.64">to the mega banks in other words the</text>
  <text start="435.14" dur="9.95">rate hike just facilitates more looting</text>
  <text start="437.87" dur="12.32">by the one percent that is it now by</text>
  <text start="445.09" dur="7.51">increasing the Fed fund rate this</text>
  <text start="450.19" dur="5.38">eventually is going to implode the</text>
  <text start="452.6" dur="5.97">financial system this one increase is</text>
  <text start="455.57" dur="5.21">not going to do it we will see cracks we</text>
  <text start="458.57" dur="4.41">will see things starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="460.78" dur="3.85">but again the US government the federal</text>
  <text start="462.98" dur="3.63">reserve they can hide this with their</text>
  <text start="464.63" dur="8.88">manipulation of what is really going on</text>
  <text start="466.61" dur="10.14">and in back in June of 2014 the ECB cut</text>
  <text start="473.51" dur="4.53">interest rates to negative so before</text>
  <text start="476.75" dur="3.15">this the interest rate differential</text>
  <text start="478.04" dur="5.01">between euro and the US dollar was just</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="4.8">about point two five percent and the US</text>
  <text start="483.05" dur="3.36">dollar was yielding about point two five</text>
  <text start="484.7" dur="5.16">percent while the deposit rate on the</text>
  <text start="486.41" dur="5.55">euro was exactly zero this was kind of</text>
  <text start="489.86" dur="3.78">significant the interest rate</text>
  <text start="491.96" dur="3.6">differential was not enough to kick off</text>
  <text start="493.64" dur="3.9">a complete flight of capital from the</text>
  <text start="495.56" dur="4.92">euro to the US dollar to the US dollar</text>
  <text start="497.54" dur="5.34">however when the ECB launched nerp</text>
  <text start="500.48" dur="5.49">negative interest rates cutting its</text>
  <text start="502.88" dur="5.46">deposit rate to negative 0.1% the rate</text>
  <text start="505.97" dur="6.87">differential went up two point three</text>
  <text start="508.34" dur="6.63">five percent and basically resulted in</text>
  <text start="512.84" dur="5.61">vast quantities of capital fleeing euros</text>
  <text start="514.97" dur="7.14">into dollars so there are over nine</text>
  <text start="518.45" dur="6.06">trillion in borrowed US dollars sloshing</text>
  <text start="522.11" dur="4.56">around the financial system and much of</text>
  <text start="524.51" dur="4.11">it is parked in assets that are</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="6.12">denominated in emerging-market</text>
  <text start="528.62" dur="7.85">currencies the very currencies that</text>
  <text start="532.79" dur="8.7">imploded as the US dollar has rallied</text>
  <text start="536.47" dur="7.78">this is the US dollar carry trade and it</text>
  <text start="541.49" dur="6">is a larger in scope than economies of</text>
  <text start="544.25" dur="6.39">Germany and Japan combined in short when</text>
  <text start="547.49" dur="6.05">the ECB cut their rates to negative the</text>
  <text start="550.64" dur="7.55">US dollar carry trade began to blow up</text>
  <text start="553.54" dur="7.96">now the situation has worsened because</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="5.38">basically the Fed has raised the Fed</text>
  <text start="561.5" dur="5.88">fund rate</text>
  <text start="563.57" dur="6">and what this means is the differential</text>
  <text start="567.38" dur="4.74">between euro and the US dollar has hit</text>
  <text start="569.57" dur="4.86">point seven five percent this will</text>
  <text start="572.12" dur="5.31">trigger a complete implosion of the nine</text>
  <text start="574.43" dur="4.44">trillion u.s. dollar carry trade at this</text>
  <text start="577.43" dur="5.27">point the nine trillion u.s. dollar</text>
  <text start="578.87" dur="7.65">carry trade will implode triggering a</text>
  <text start="582.7" dur="6.43">2008 type of an event so what is the</text>
  <text start="586.52" dur="5.27">timeline of all this most likely this is</text>
  <text start="589.13" dur="5.31">going to happen in six to twelve months</text>
  <text start="591.79" dur="3.67">because as we know the Fed is saying</text>
  <text start="594.44" dur="4.41">that they&amp;#39;re going to be looking at the</text>
  <text start="595.46" dur="5.55">Fed fund rate next year and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="598.85" dur="4.23">looking to raise it four more times are</text>
  <text start="601.01" dur="4.62">they ever going to get to that most</text>
  <text start="603.08" dur="5.46">likely no most likely what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="605.63" dur="4.23">happen is they&amp;#39;re going to say yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="608.54" dur="3.48">going to be raising the rates they might</text>
  <text start="609.86" dur="6.78">do it one more time another quarter of a</text>
  <text start="612.02" dur="9.09">percentage but if everything goes as</text>
  <text start="616.64" dur="8.07">planned the event will occur they will</text>
  <text start="621.11" dur="6.63">never get to raising the rate and they</text>
  <text start="624.71" dur="6.81">will blame this entire collapse on</text>
  <text start="627.74" dur="5.34">another group or country all eyes will</text>
  <text start="631.52" dur="4.02">be off of the central bank they have</text>
  <text start="633.08" dur="9.42">just proven that they&amp;#39;ve recovered the</text>
  <text start="635.54" dur="10.11">economy their task is complete now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="642.5" dur="6.3">in the next phase now we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="645.65" dur="6.78">towards that area of when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="648.8" dur="6.81">getting prepared and ready to push this</text>
  <text start="652.43" dur="4.98">war forward now at this point since</text>
  <text start="655.61" dur="3.3">everyone believes that we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="657.41" dur="5.01">recovery they&amp;#39;re going to suppress gold</text>
  <text start="658.91" dur="7.44">even further we&amp;#39;re probably going to see</text>
  <text start="662.42" dur="5.31">oil prices go down even further already</text>
  <text start="666.35" dur="3.78">Saudi Arabia is saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="667.73" dur="4.83">going to continually pumping oil but</text>
  <text start="670.13" dur="5.19">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that there is</text>
  <text start="672.56" dur="5.87">a glut of oil and it&amp;#39;s starting to manuf</text>
  <text start="675.32" dur="7.97">it manifest itself in a flotilla of</text>

  <text start="683.29" dur="5.65">there is about 40 crude tankers with</text>

  <text start="877.97" dur="7.23">worry about them about the penalty</text>
  <text start="881.21" dur="6.48">whatsoever and you can see this is part</text>
  <text start="885.2" dur="5.34">of their plan they need new blood in</text>
  <text start="887.69" dur="4.92">this country to continually pump up the</text>

  <text start="927.41" dur="5.88">this or whenever he gets around to doing</text>
  <text start="929.69" dur="7.2">it and it&amp;#39;s all going to go through and</text>
  <text start="933.29" dur="6.48">this law of this bill this legislation</text>
  <text start="936.89" dur="4.59">of cissa will then become law which will</text>
