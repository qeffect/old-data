  <text start="67.13" dur="4.89">the deal which pushes the plan forward</text>
  <text start="69.49" dur="5.56">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.02" dur="4.86">political and geopolitical news now</text>
  <text start="75.05" dur="3.54">yesterday we talked about struck and</text>
  <text start="76.88" dur="4.71">lisa page and lisa page was supposed to</text>
  <text start="78.59" dur="5.22">testify behind closed doors with the</text>
  <text start="81.59" dur="5.69">House Judiciary Committee and it looks</text>
  <text start="83.81" dur="6.36">like Lisa page plans to blatantly defy a</text>
  <text start="87.28" dur="6.19">congressional subpoena by refusing to</text>
  <text start="90.17" dur="5.699">appear for her deposition and Goodlatte</text>
  <text start="93.47" dur="4.439">is out there saying that it appears key</text>
  <text start="95.869" dur="4.831">witness lisa page has something to hide</text>
  <text start="97.909" dur="6.511">and congress will use all tools at their</text>
  <text start="100.7" dur="7.74">disposal to obtain her testimony and we</text>
  <text start="104.42" dur="6">see right now that lisa pages lawyer is</text>
  <text start="108.44" dur="3.989">out there saying that she didn&amp;#39;t receive</text>
  <text start="110.42" dur="4.47">the documents they didn&amp;#39;t receive the</text>
  <text start="112.429" dur="5.371">documents that were supposed to be given</text>
  <text start="114.89" dur="6.509">to us and we weren&amp;#39;t able to review them</text>
  <text start="117.8" dur="5.79">and Jeffreys who is lisa pages lawyer</text>
  <text start="121.399" dur="5.161">said the committee&amp;#39;s have not honored</text>
  <text start="123.59" dur="4.919">this request as a result lisa is not</text>
  <text start="126.56" dur="5.61">going to appear for an interview at this</text>
  <text start="128.509" dur="6.331">time however the freedom caucus chairman</text>
  <text start="132.17" dur="4.89">mark meadows tweeted that page and her</text>
  <text start="134.84" dur="5.13">attorneys did review the requested</text>
  <text start="137.06" dur="5.069">documents at the FBI on tuesday and that</text>
  <text start="139.97" dur="4.349">her failure to appear before Congress</text>
  <text start="142.129" dur="4.891">this morning had eluded had little to do</text>
  <text start="144.319" dur="5.581">with preparation and everything to do</text>
  <text start="147.02" dur="5.91">with avoiding accountability so we</text>
  <text start="149.9" dur="5.88">already see right now that she&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="152.93" dur="5.49">going to testify and they&amp;#39;re gonna take</text>
  <text start="155.78" dur="6.209">the appropriate actions and again these</text>
  <text start="158.42" dur="6.3">individuals they know what is happening</text>
  <text start="161.989" dur="6">here and they realize that they are</text>
  <text start="164.72" dur="5.909">stuck we see the federal judge has now</text>
  <text start="167.989" dur="6.481">delayed the sentencing for Michael Flynn</text>
  <text start="170.629" dur="5.64">once again now yesterday we thought the</text>
  <text start="174.47" dur="3.54">judge said no more delays no more of</text>
  <text start="176.269" dur="4.141">anything but it looks like the federal</text>
  <text start="178.01" dur="5.98">judge has delayed the sentencing now we</text>
  <text start="180.41" dur="5.44">know that Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner</text>
  <text start="183.99" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re in the center of the Clinton</text>
  <text start="185.85" dur="5.52">email scandal and everything else and I</text>
  <text start="189.24" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t believe in coincidences I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="4.08">believe like ooh this just happened to</text>
  <text start="192.78" dur="6.41">happen what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all</text>
  <text start="195.45" dur="7.26">this in Anthony Weiner&amp;#39;s and Huma Abedin</text>
  <text start="199.19" dur="7.05">apartment complex in Manhattan in the</text>
  <text start="202.71" dur="7.5">trash compactor they found a dead body</text>
  <text start="206.24" dur="7.77">now this is in their building they both</text>
  <text start="210.21" dur="6.9">own this apartment in this building and</text>
  <text start="214.01" dur="5.8">the police were called there the female</text>
  <text start="217.11" dur="5.25">is unidentified and was discovered</text>
  <text start="219.81" dur="5.16">inside the trash compactor of the</text>
  <text start="222.36" dur="5.49">Manhattan apartment complex that human a</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="5.04">burden and convicted pedophile Anthony</text>
  <text start="227.85" dur="5.7">Weiner have used as a base for the last</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="6.12">16 years who is this person we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="233.55" dur="5.64">know why is this person there we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="236.13" dur="5.61">know but again don&amp;#39;t you find it odd</text>
  <text start="239.19" dur="6.77">that this individual is in their</text>
  <text start="241.74" dur="6.54">building in a trash compactor very odd</text>
  <text start="245.96" dur="4.26">and things are getting stranger and</text>
  <text start="248.28" dur="5.79">stranger as we move forward</text>
  <text start="250.22" dur="6.01">we see there are certain GOP members of</text>
  <text start="254.07" dur="4.979">Congress they&amp;#39;re taking matters into</text>
  <text start="256.23" dur="4.53">their own hands and because of all these</text>
  <text start="259.049" dur="4.771">different violent attacks by these</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="6.27">masked individuals which is an Tifa they</text>
  <text start="263.82" dur="4.83">decided to create a bill where it says</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="4.49">the following and that the bill is</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="6.63">called the unmasking and Tifa act of</text>
  <text start="271.52" dur="6.37">2018 whoever whether or not acting under</text>
  <text start="275.28" dur="5.46">color of law while in disguise including</text>
  <text start="277.89" dur="5.64">while wearing a mask injures oppresses</text>
  <text start="280.74" dur="5.57">threatens or intimidates any person in</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="5.73">any state territory Commonwealth</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="5.26">possession or district in the free</text>
  <text start="289.26" dur="4.89">exercise or enjoyment of any right or</text>
  <text start="291.57" dur="5.64">privilege secured to him by the</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="5.19">Constitution or laws of the United</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="5.01">States or because of his having so</text>
  <text start="299.34" dur="6.18">exercised the same shall be fined under</text>
  <text start="302.22" dur="6.81">this title imprison not no more than 15</text>
  <text start="305.52" dur="5.52">years or both well you are allowed to go</text>
  <text start="309.03" dur="6.06">around with a mask on the thing you</text>
  <text start="311.04" dur="5.629">cannot do is hurt someone threaten</text>
  <text start="315.09" dur="3.079">people</text>
  <text start="316.669" dur="3.631">and things like that we already have</text>
  <text start="318.169" dur="3.481">laws for that and again what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="4.199">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to stop</text>
  <text start="321.65" dur="5.91">an Tifa because they&amp;#39;re a very violent</text>
  <text start="324.499" dur="5.76">group they destroy property they wear</text>
  <text start="327.56" dur="5.819">masks so nobody can identify them and we</text>
  <text start="330.259" dur="6.93">know that this is all part of the deep</text>
  <text start="333.379" dur="6.6">state plan to push riots to push Anarchy</text>
  <text start="337.189" dur="4.861">all throughout the country they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="339.979" dur="5.761">this group but it has not worked</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="6.63">we know that the judge has given the</text>
  <text start="345.74" dur="6.419">Trump administration a timeline to</text>
  <text start="348.68" dur="6.78">reunite children with their parents and</text>
  <text start="352.159" dur="6.901">of course once you do this this is going</text>
  <text start="355.46" dur="6.209">to fail because there&amp;#39;s no gray area in</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="5.609">this first of all how do you know that</text>
  <text start="361.669" dur="6.24">these are the parents of the children</text>
  <text start="364.669" dur="4.62">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="367.909" dur="3.06">Department of Homeland Security and</text>
  <text start="369.289" dur="3.93">Department of Health and Human Services</text>
  <text start="370.969" dur="4.47">they held a joint call Tuesday to</text>
  <text start="373.219" dur="3.711">announce their efforts to comply with</text>
  <text start="375.439" dur="3.84">the June 26 federal court ruling</text>
  <text start="376.93" dur="6.039">mandating children under five years old</text>
  <text start="379.279" dur="5.73">in HHS custody be reunited with parents</text>
  <text start="382.969" dur="5.01">if they were separated at the border and</text>
  <text start="385.009" dur="6.72">of course this ruling came from US</text>
  <text start="387.979" dur="5.43">District Judge Dana sebuah in response</text>
  <text start="391.729" dur="5.49">to the American Civil Liberties Union</text>
  <text start="393.409" dur="6.75">lawsuit which was on July 10th and that</text>
  <text start="397.219" dur="8.551">was the deadline the problem here is</text>
  <text start="400.159" dur="9.18">that they don&amp;#39;t know if these adults are</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="6.419">the parents of these children so the</text>
  <text start="409.339" dur="6.961">joint status report notes that in at</text>
  <text start="412.189" dur="6.75">least 14 of the 102 children cases they</text>
  <text start="416.3" dur="4.56">will not be uniting them with parents</text>
  <text start="418.939" dur="4.53">because the adults in question are</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="4.229">either not actually their parents have</text>
  <text start="423.469" dur="4.141">been convicted of a serious crime</text>
  <text start="425.089" dur="5.58">including rape and murder or have</text>
  <text start="427.61" dur="4.799">incredibly accused of child abuse the</text>
  <text start="430.669" dur="4.641">government will not place children with</text>
  <text start="432.409" dur="7.47">adults without completing these checks</text>
  <text start="435.31" dur="6.94">HHS chief staff Chris Meekins went on to</text>
  <text start="439.879" dur="3.66">explain that three parents admitted they</text>
  <text start="442.25" dur="3.209">were not actually related to the</text>
  <text start="443.539" dur="4.23">children with whom they were ordered to</text>
  <text start="445.459" dur="4.691">be reunited when agents brought out DNA</text>
  <text start="447.769" dur="4.691">swabs to test the parentage</text>
  <text start="450.15" dur="4.22">two others were proven not to be the</text>
  <text start="452.46" dur="4.8">parents when DNA tests were completed</text>
  <text start="454.37" dur="4.57">eight other purported parents will not</text>
  <text start="457.26" dur="4.41">be reunited with the children due to</text>
  <text start="458.94" dur="4.65">failed criminal background checks that</text>
  <text start="461.67" dur="4.53">turned up serious convictions or child</text>
  <text start="463.59" dur="5.37">abuse and they&amp;#39;re saying that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="466.2" dur="4.62">comply with this law because some of</text>
  <text start="468.96" dur="5.37">them well these are not their parents</text>
  <text start="470.82" dur="5.01">the other ones are criminals and they</text>
  <text start="474.33" dur="3.84">just can&amp;#39;t do it but the judge is saying</text>
  <text start="475.83" dur="5.58">you have to do it which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="478.17" dur="6.09">ridiculous and of course this ruling was</text>
  <text start="481.41" dur="4.89">set up to fail from the beginning we see</text>
  <text start="484.26" dur="3.9">NATO secretary-general agreed on</text>
  <text start="486.3" dur="3.24">Wednesday that trumps call for other</text>
  <text start="488.16" dur="4.11">members to boost their defence spending</text>
  <text start="489.54" dur="5.28">under the military alliance is having an</text>
  <text start="492.27" dur="4.5">effect and other members are going to</text>
  <text start="494.82" dur="4.26">boost the amount that they push into</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="6.51">NATO and again do we really need NATO</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="7.1">today most likely not Russia is not a</text>
  <text start="503.28" dur="6.47">threat this was created out of thin air</text>
  <text start="506.18" dur="7.68">NATO was created to combat Russia and</text>
  <text start="509.75" dur="7.78">right now Russia once again is a made up</text>
  <text start="513.86" dur="7.39">enemy Turkey is going to receive the</text>
  <text start="517.53" dur="6.9">first batch of s400 systems in 2019 and</text>
  <text start="521.25" dur="6.18">it looks like turkey is going along with</text>
  <text start="524.43" dur="6.48">Russia not the United States and their</text>
  <text start="527.43" dur="4.83">military equipment Assad&amp;#39;s regime they</text>
  <text start="530.91" dur="4.59">have widened their assault in the</text>
  <text start="532.26" dur="5.73">southwest area of Syria they have hit</text>
  <text start="535.5" dur="5.01">the Islamic state pockets and they are</text>
  <text start="537.99" dur="5.22">just going through all these different</text>
  <text start="540.51" dur="5.19">areas and liberating all these different</text>
  <text start="543.21" dur="5.13">areas and it looks like the clock is now</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="4.95">ticking down for the Islamic state al</text>
  <text start="548.34" dur="4.2">Qaeda the paid mercenaries and the rest</text>
  <text start="550.65" dur="3.48">and rebels right now they have</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="4.89">surrendered in the southern districts of</text>
  <text start="554.13" dur="5.64">Daraa and we also see from all these</text>
  <text start="557.43" dur="4.92">different areas that have surrendered or</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="6">they&amp;#39;ve captured these areas they are</text>
  <text start="562.35" dur="5.85">uncovering UK made weapons along borders</text>
  <text start="565.77" dur="4.7">with Jordan we&amp;#39;re also seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="568.2" dur="6.21">weapons from the US especially the</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="7.21">anti-tank weapons like the javelin and</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="5.88">the tow and again these were given to</text>
  <text start="577.68" dur="5.01">the rebels but we know that the rebels</text>
  <text start="580.29" dur="3.74">the Islamic state al Qaeda they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="582.69" dur="3.56">one in the same group</text>
  <text start="584.03" dur="4.95">and now they&amp;#39;re finding that all these</text>
  <text start="586.25" dur="6.54">weapons are turning up with the Islamic</text>
  <text start="588.98" dur="7.83">state or al-nusra or al-qaeda and once</text>
  <text start="592.79" dur="7.56">again we see that this was being pushed</text>
  <text start="596.81" dur="6.78">by who the Obama administration under</text>
  <text start="600.35" dur="6.81">the timber Sycamore plan</text>
  <text start="603.59" dur="5.16">this was the covert CIA program which</text>
  <text start="607.16" dur="3.45">was established during the Obama</text>
  <text start="608.75" dur="4.35">administration to arm Syrian rebels</text>
  <text start="610.61" dur="5.49">locked in a protracted civil war against</text>
  <text start="613.1" dur="5.16">Assad regime and at least 500 tow</text>
  <text start="616.1" dur="4.05">missiles were reportedly transferred</text>
  <text start="618.26" dur="5.3">through Saudi Arabia to the Free Syrian</text>
  <text start="620.15" dur="7.29">Army in late 2015 and in February 2016 a</text>
  <text start="623.56" dur="9.22">Washington Post reporter Thomas Givens</text>
  <text start="627.44" dur="7.47">Neph notice that a javelin anti-tank</text>
  <text start="632.78" dur="6.12">weapon was in the hands of the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="634.91" dur="6.48">YPG forces now again this weapon was not</text>
  <text start="638.9" dur="5.1">given to them it was given to the</text>
  <text start="641.39" dur="4.17">moderate rebels but again all these</text>
  <text start="644" dur="3.51">different areas were all one in the same</text>
  <text start="645.56" dur="3.63">and they were just passing the weapons</text>
  <text start="647.51" dur="6">back and forth and I remember in July</text>
  <text start="649.19" dur="6.57">Trump moved to end the timber sycamore</text>
  <text start="653.51" dur="2.82">plan that Obama created and that was</text>
  <text start="655.76" dur="3.3">stopped</text>
  <text start="656.33" dur="5.04">we know that the funding to the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="659.06" dur="4.5">group was also stopped they were funding</text>
  <text start="661.37" dur="5.31">the military because they were trying to</text>
  <text start="663.56" dur="5.4">separate Syria the training and the</text>
  <text start="666.68" dur="4.65">payment towards the moderate rebels that</text>
  <text start="668.96" dur="5.61">was discontinued and we see that things</text>
  <text start="671.33" dur="5.76">are changing dramatically everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="674.57" dur="5.13">coming to a screeching halt now we know</text>
  <text start="677.09" dur="4.26">that Netanyahu is going to meet with</text>
  <text start="679.7" dur="5.52">Putin we know that Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="681.35" dur="8.01">meet with Putin and this is part of the</text>
  <text start="685.22" dur="6.71">plan once they both meet the deal will</text>
  <text start="689.36" dur="7.4">be sealed and what this means is</text>
  <text start="691.93" dur="10.03">Netanyahu is going to say listen we need</text>
  <text start="696.76" dur="8.17">you Putin to have Assad remove Iran the</text>
  <text start="701.96" dur="4.34">advisors everyone from Syria once this</text>
  <text start="704.93" dur="4.08">is confirmed</text>
  <text start="706.3" dur="6.01">Netanyahu&amp;#39;s going to speak to Trump and</text>
  <text start="709.01" dur="8.43">have the sanctions removed from Russia</text>
  <text start="712.31" dur="6.6">and I believe this is part of</text>
  <text start="717.44" dur="3.689">the plan which is in the beginning</text>
  <text start="718.91" dur="3.659">stages here to get the troops out of</text>
  <text start="721.129" dur="4.741">Syria because what do they want to do</text>
  <text start="722.569" dur="6.301">they want to show that Iran now is no</text>
  <text start="725.87" dur="6">longer a threat in Syria no longer a</text>
  <text start="728.87" dur="6.29">threat on the border of Israel no longer</text>
