  <text start="58.71" dur="4.2">episode is Trump plants subtle clues in</text>
  <text start="61.32" dur="4.38">his office to let the central bankers</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="6.06">know their fate let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="65.7" dur="5.19">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="68.97" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re gonna head out to Venezuela and we</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="5.19">can see that over the years the United</text>
  <text start="74.49" dur="2.22">States government central bankers a deep</text>
  <text start="76.08" dur="4.5">state</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;ve been meddling in Venezuela they</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="5.76">want Venezuela they want a regime change</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="7.11">they want to take control of their oil</text>
  <text start="86.34" dur="6.6">reserves and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="6.51">Venezuela well the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="92.94" dur="5.85">completely falling apart their cash</text>
  <text start="96.39" dur="7.04">reserves right now are at a catastrophic</text>
  <text start="98.79" dur="6.93">low they&amp;#39;re around 10 billion in cash</text>
  <text start="103.43" dur="4.35">now even though they have the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="4.23">largest oil reserves</text>
  <text start="107.78" dur="5.29">Venezuela&amp;#39;s economy well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="109.95" dur="7.26">struggling just to stay afloat this is</text>
  <text start="113.07" dur="6.54">why we see the food dry up on the</text>
  <text start="117.21" dur="7.019">shelves long lines at supermarkets</text>
  <text start="119.61" dur="8.61">people fighting over meat and we can see</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="4.64">right now that over these next couple of</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="3.45">months</text>
  <text start="128.869" dur="4.87">it looks like the Venezuelan government</text>
  <text start="131.67" dur="4.71">is going to crash now this is what</text>
  <text start="133.739" dur="5.761">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="136.38" dur="5.37">want they want to get that government</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="3.54">out of power they want to put in a</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="3.87">puppet government they want to take</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="5.97">control of the oil just like in the</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="6.83">Middle East no difference and they were</text>
  <text start="149.01" dur="5.85">hoping that this was going to work now</text>
  <text start="152.45" dur="5.289">when you look at Venezuela as cash</text>
  <text start="154.86" dur="6.48">reserves they have about 10 billion or</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="4.951">so and 7.2 billion of which they must</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="5.49">use this year just to pay off</text>
  <text start="162.69" dur="6.06">outstanding debts for instance in 2015</text>
  <text start="166.83" dur="4.32">Venezuela had twenty billion dollars in</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="5.43">reserves and in 2011 and had 30 billion</text>
  <text start="171.15" dur="8.73">in reserves now it only has ten billion</text>
  <text start="174.18" dur="7.46">and 7.2 is going off to pay for debt so</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="5.54">after they pay that off</text>
  <text start="181.64" dur="8.04">they really don&amp;#39;t have much left and we</text>
  <text start="185.42" dur="6.78">can see that time is ticking down and we</text>
  <text start="189.68" dur="4.56">should take notice of this because again</text>
  <text start="192.2" dur="6.05">the United States government the debt</text>
  <text start="194.24" dur="5.73">ceiling is coming up March 15th where</text>
  <text start="198.25" dur="4.39">Congress is going to have to make a</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="5.01">decision do we raise the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="202.64" dur="4.92">and put the country into further debt or</text>
  <text start="204.98" dur="4.759">you know what we&amp;#39;re calling it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="207.56" dur="6.3">done we&amp;#39;re not raising the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="209.739" dur="7.121">now remember last time the Republicans</text>
  <text start="213.86" dur="6.11">didn&amp;#39;t want the debt ceiling raised the</text>
  <text start="216.86" dur="6.15">Democrats they wanted it pushed up</text>
  <text start="219.97" dur="6.1">Boehner and Obama they came up with this</text>
  <text start="223.01" dur="6.449">deal that they pushed it off until 2017</text>
  <text start="226.07" dur="6">once Obama left office so here we are</text>
  <text start="229.459" dur="4.371">once again there are many people out</text>
  <text start="232.07" dur="4.199">there they&amp;#39;re saying that this time</text>
  <text start="233.83" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re not going to do it they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="236.269" dur="5.22">going to raise the debt ceiling which</text>
  <text start="238.7" dur="5.37">means the United States is going to fall</text>
  <text start="241.489" dur="4.741">into the category of what Venezuela is</text>
  <text start="244.07" dur="5.54">going through right now where we only</text>
  <text start="246.23" dur="6.12">have a certain cash in reserves and that</text>
  <text start="249.61" dur="6.969">cash in reserves is going to run out</text>
  <text start="252.35" dur="5.879">over time now when we look at this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.579" dur="4.921">only a couple of months that the United</text>
  <text start="258.229" dur="4.891">States can survive so we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="4.11">to watch this situation very closely</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="4.85">because March 15th is going to come yes</text>
  <text start="265.61" dur="5.82">the debt ceiling won&amp;#39;t be raised on</text>
  <text start="267.97" dur="5.74">March 15th but we have to wait to see</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="5.549">over the next coming weeks because if we</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="7.56">enter April if we go past the tax season</text>
  <text start="276.979" dur="6.151">of April 15th and we go into May I would</text>
  <text start="281.27" dur="6.959">say at that point if the debt ceiling is</text>
  <text start="283.13" dur="8.37">not raised that is a warning sign to all</text>
  <text start="288.229" dur="6.661">of you to start ramping on them and I</text>
  <text start="291.5" dur="7.59">say ramping up I mean getting as much as</text>
  <text start="294.89" dur="9.11">you possibly can at that point that</text>
  <text start="299.09" dur="8.82">means the collapse is a go that means</text>
  <text start="304" dur="6.88">that they&amp;#39;re not going to raise the debt</text>
  <text start="307.91" dur="6.75">ceiling the United States is going to</text>
  <text start="310.88" dur="4.91">run out of funds government workers will</text>
  <text start="314.66" dur="5.99">be laid</text>
  <text start="315.79" dur="10.34">programs will be stopped and this is</text>
  <text start="320.65" dur="9.09">when we enter a chaotic period so that</text>
  <text start="326.13" dur="6.81">is a warning sign to everyone remember</text>
  <text start="329.74" dur="5.55">that tax receipts have been falling</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="3.91">every single year the federal tax</text>
  <text start="335.29" dur="3.57">receipts the money coming into the</text>
  <text start="336.85" dur="5.67">government the state tax receipts have</text>
  <text start="338.86" dur="6.56">also been falling and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="5.4">how much has brought in at this time</text>
  <text start="345.42" dur="8.95">because that is the money they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="347.92" dur="8.34">to use to pay for things so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="4.38">have to watch this very very carefully</text>
  <text start="356.26" dur="6.03">and we&amp;#39;ll know in April 15th or April</text>
  <text start="358.75" dur="7.23">20th what they&amp;#39;re planning on doing we</text>
  <text start="362.29" dur="6.09">enter May and nothing is done well that</text>
  <text start="365.98" dur="6.3">should tell you you need to start</text>
  <text start="368.38" dur="7.97">preparing aggressively because that</text>
  <text start="372.28" dur="10.23">means we only have a couple of months</text>
  <text start="376.35" dur="9.13">now in the retail market they keep</text>
  <text start="382.51" dur="6.03">blaming amazon for what is happening in</text>
  <text start="385.48" dur="7.91">the brick-and-mortar stores well it</text>
  <text start="388.54" dur="8.43">turns out this is not true at all</text>
  <text start="393.39" dur="7.83">now Moody&amp;#39;s is out there they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="396.97" dur="4.25">retailers are on the brink of death</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="5.77">they&amp;#39;re saying hundreds of department</text>
  <text start="404.02" dur="8.64">stores are closing and more are on their</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="8.19">way and we see Brendan Witcher a retail</text>
  <text start="412.66" dur="6.87">and e-commerce analyst at research firm</text>
  <text start="415.24" dur="6.36">Forrester he completely denies the</text>
  <text start="419.53" dur="7.08">notion that Amazon can meaningfully</text>
  <text start="421.6" dur="6.33">explain the flux in retail space he says</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s simply not true</text>
  <text start="427.93" dur="5.04">it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense when you look</text>
  <text start="429.76" dur="4.83">at the actual numbers and Witcher is</text>
  <text start="432.97" dur="3.6">referring to the fact that online</text>
  <text start="434.59" dur="5.01">shopping still makes up less than a</text>
  <text start="436.57" dur="5.46">tenth of the country&amp;#39;s total retail</text>
  <text start="439.6" dur="7.08">sales despite doubling in the past five</text>
  <text start="442.03" dur="6.18">years and this is often cited by the US</text>
  <text start="446.68" dur="2.64">Census Bureau it&amp;#39;s on the corporate</text>
  <text start="448.21" dur="3.9">media and they</text>
  <text start="449.32" dur="5.13">that word whoa online sales they have</text>
  <text start="452.11" dur="4.11">doubled and this is why the</text>
  <text start="454.45" dur="3.99">brick-and-mortar stores can&amp;#39;t survive</text>
  <text start="456.22" dur="4.83">because everyone&amp;#39;s shopping online and</text>
  <text start="458.44" dur="4.5">as we can see this figure is really</text>
  <text start="461.05" dur="5.67">misleading on its face because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.94" dur="6.54">overly broad for most purposes for one</text>
  <text start="466.72" dur="5.13">it includes gas stations on the retail</text>
  <text start="469.48" dur="4.53">side which obviously don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="471.85" dur="4.23">online equivalent it also lumps together</text>
  <text start="474.01" dur="4.08">everything from groceries to auto parts</text>
  <text start="476.08" dur="4.35">and furniture among which the ratio of</text>
  <text start="478.09" dur="7.17">online to offline sales varies greatly</text>
  <text start="480.43" dur="8.31">and we can see that the real world</text>
  <text start="485.26" dur="9.15">industry is headed towards a bloodbath</text>
  <text start="488.74" dur="8.67">and actually when we listen to the CEO</text>
  <text start="494.41" dur="6.72">of Urban Outfitters he is saying that</text>
  <text start="497.41" dur="6.51">the retail bubble has now burst just</text>
  <text start="501.13" dur="7.11">like housing and what he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="503.92" dur="9.6">is the number of empty commercial real</text>
  <text start="508.24" dur="7.77">estate Lots in the US it is gigantic he</text>
  <text start="513.52" dur="5.85">says and it looks like at this point</text>
  <text start="516.01" dur="5.79">that that is the next bubble that is</text>
  <text start="519.37" dur="4.32">going to pop right now now the bankers</text>
  <text start="521.8" dur="5.46">are not going to be very happy with</text>
  <text start="523.69" dur="6.51">Trump because it looks like Trump he did</text>
  <text start="527.26" dur="5.49">promise to restore glass-steagall and it</text>
  <text start="530.2" dur="4.68">looks like coming from Sean Spicer he</text>
  <text start="532.75" dur="5.37">says that Trump is still committed to</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="5.67">restoring glass-steagall and as soon as</text>
  <text start="538.12" dur="5.43">this was mentioned the stock market went</text>
  <text start="540.55" dur="5.67">down a little bit because the banks they</text>
  <text start="543.55" dur="6.35">don&amp;#39;t want glass-steagall they like</text>
  <text start="546.22" dur="7.1">making these speculative investments and</text>
  <text start="549.9" dur="7.9">this is what led up to the 2008 crash</text>
  <text start="553.32" dur="7.54">this was the start of it now something</text>
  <text start="557.8" dur="5.4">very interesting in Trump&amp;#39;s office he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.86" dur="6.42">leaving subtle clues on what he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="563.2" dur="6.51">to do with the central bank and right</text>
  <text start="567.28" dur="4.47">now we know it&amp;#39;s no secret that America</text>
  <text start="569.71" dur="5.97">is really governed by the US Federal</text>
  <text start="571.75" dur="6.75">Reserve System and the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="575.68" dur="5.22">well they&amp;#39;re in charge of the money</text>
  <text start="578.5" dur="4.5">supply and it&amp;#39;s not part of the</text>
  <text start="580.9" dur="5.46">government it&amp;#39;s separate and apart</text>
  <text start="583" dur="8.85">it&amp;#39;s a private corporation and we see</text>
  <text start="586.36" dur="8.28">back in April of 2016 the Treasury</text>
  <text start="591.85" dur="4.2">secretary back then Jacob Lew announced</text>
  <text start="594.64" dur="3.21">that the country was gonna change the</text>
  <text start="596.05" dur="4.44">five to ten and twenty dollar bill and</text>
  <text start="597.85" dur="4.59">have a new design and then they came out</text>
  <text start="600.49" dur="5.79">with saying that well the people are</text>
  <text start="602.44" dur="6.09">demanding that we change who is on the</text>
  <text start="606.28" dur="3.9">bills when he says we&amp;#39;re just following</text>
  <text start="608.53" dur="4.17">the voice of the people now of course</text>
  <text start="610.18" dur="3.84">they never let us know how they came up</text>
  <text start="612.7" dur="5.43">with this of course they were making</text>
  <text start="614.02" dur="7.11">this up their whole plan was to remove</text>
  <text start="618.13" dur="6.57">Andrew Jackson from the $20 bill and</text>
  <text start="621.13" dur="7.14">replace Andrew Jackson with Harriet</text>
  <text start="624.7" dur="5.94">Tubman now everyone was like well he was</text>
  <text start="628.27" dur="4.25">a slave owner he was this and he was</text>
  <text start="630.64" dur="6.99">that well you have to remember the time</text>
  <text start="632.52" dur="7.66">going back to that time period and that</text>
  <text start="637.63" dur="5.4">was the norm back then and if we start</text>
  <text start="640.18" dur="5.7">removing all these individuals from</text>
  <text start="643.03" dur="4.92">history we wouldn&amp;#39;t have any history not</text>
  <text start="645.88" dur="6.45">just in the United States but around the</text>
  <text start="647.95" dur="6.66">world yes times change but the real</text>
  <text start="652.33" dur="5.61">reason why they didn&amp;#39;t want Andrew</text>
  <text start="654.61" dur="7.2">Jackson on the 20 is because he got rid</text>
  <text start="657.94" dur="7.92">of the central bank the second Bank in</text>
  <text start="661.81" dur="8.76">the United States now he ran on a</text>
  <text start="665.86" dur="10.49">campaign slogan where he said no Bank</text>
  <text start="670.57" dur="8.19">and Jackson or Bank and no Jackson and</text>
  <text start="676.35" dur="4.84">Trump did something very very</text>
  <text start="678.76" dur="7.32">interesting when he moved into the White</text>
  <text start="681.19" dur="8.13">House he put up a portrait of Andrew</text>
  <text start="686.08" dur="7.83">Jackson it&amp;#39;s right behind him in his</text>
  <text start="689.32" dur="7.23">office what does that tell you that</text>
  <text start="693.91" dur="7.55">tells you that he&amp;#39;s sending a message to</text>
  <text start="696.55" dur="7.53">the central bankers and we see right now</text>
  <text start="701.46" dur="5.07">one of the things that Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="704.08" dur="5.19">said and this really sums it up</text>
  <text start="706.53" dur="5.47">controlling our currency receiving our</text>
  <text start="709.27" dur="6.12">public monies and holding thousands of</text>
  <text start="712" dur="4.889">our citizens independence it would be</text>
  <text start="715.39" dur="5.009">more formidable</text>
  <text start="716.889" dur="7.41">dangerous than then the navel and the</text>
  <text start="720.399" dur="7.53">military power of the enemy and what</text>
  <text start="724.299" dur="5.16">he&amp;#39;s saying is that a central bank that</text>
  <text start="727.929" dur="4.82">is not part of the US government not</text>
  <text start="729.459" dur="6.42">working for the people is more dangerous</text>
  <text start="732.749" dur="9">than the military power of an enemy and</text>
  <text start="735.879" dur="9.721">we can see that today and just by Trump</text>
  <text start="741.749" dur="7.471">putting up Andrew Jackson&amp;#39;s portrait it</text>
  <text start="745.6" dur="9.06">sends a message to the central bank</text>
  <text start="749.22" dur="11.019">saying listen we&amp;#39;re coming for you we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="754.66" dur="9.299">going to get rid of you and this really</text>
  <text start="760.239" dur="6.421">should show everyone where we are headed</text>
  <text start="763.959" dur="6.84">because the fate of the central bank it</text>
  <text start="766.66" dur="6.539">looks like they are doomed and it looks</text>
  <text start="770.799" dur="4.47">like it&amp;#39;s time to remove the central</text>
  <text start="773.199" dur="4.08">bank now when Andrew Jackson tried to</text>
  <text start="775.269" dur="4.56">remove the central bank and not he</text>
  <text start="777.279" dur="4.77">actually vetoed the bill that Congress</text>
  <text start="779.829" dur="6.09">passed to extend the life of the second</text>
  <text start="782.049" dur="6.39">bank of the United States he vetoed it</text>
  <text start="785.919" dur="5.1">and of course they tried to assassinate</text>
  <text start="788.439" dur="4.95">him because this is what central bankers</text>

  <text start="794.86" dur="6.629">now again Trump right now is going up</text>
  <text start="798.399" dur="5.85">against the deep state he&amp;#39;s sending a</text>
  <text start="801.489" dur="5.04">message to the central bankers and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="804.249" dur="3.9">gonna see how far he&amp;#39;s going to take</text>
  <text start="806.529" dur="4.77">this we&amp;#39;re gonna look at his actions and</text>
  <text start="808.149" dur="4.56">see what he does that doesn&amp;#39;t mean the</text>
  <text start="811.299" dur="3.12">central bank the deep states not going</text>

  <text start="814.419" dur="2.82">react they&amp;#39;re not just gonna lay down</text>
  <text start="815.41" dur="4.649">and say hey no big deal</text>
  <text start="817.239" dur="5.04">we don&amp;#39;t need it now he doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="820.059" dur="5.851">need Congress to do anything with the</text>
  <text start="822.279" dur="7.29">central bank he can just basically say</text>
  <text start="825.91" dur="7.879">we&amp;#39;re done with it so just by putting</text>
  <text start="829.569" dur="8.64">that up in his office he&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="833.789" dur="6.79">broadcasting what he&amp;#39;s going to do so</text>
  <text start="838.209" dur="7.62">what we&amp;#39;re looking at right now is this</text>
  <text start="840.579" dur="9.261">battle between the central bank the deep</text>
  <text start="845.829" dur="6.871">state and the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="849.84" dur="5.74">where this will go what will happen well</text>
  <text start="852.7" dur="6.44">we don&amp;#39;t know at this point but what we</text>
  <text start="855.58" dur="6.98">do know is that one way or another</text>
  <text start="859.14" dur="6.31">the economy is not going to survive and</text>
  <text start="862.56" dur="4.99">we know that Trump has been promising</text>
  <text start="865.45" dur="4.59">these manufacturing jobs promising these</text>
  <text start="867.55" dur="5.58">jobs to be brought back into the US and</text>
  <text start="870.04" dur="7.02">the way the economy sits right now it</text>
  <text start="873.13" dur="6.48">makes no sense so we know that the</text>
  <text start="877.06" dur="4.62">central bank is preparing to bring down</text>
  <text start="879.61" dur="4.38">the economy and point the finger</text>
  <text start="881.68" dur="5.36">someplace else because they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="883.99" dur="5.91">raising the rates into a weak economy</text>
  <text start="887.04" dur="5.2">this was done back in 1937 the whole</text>
  <text start="889.9" dur="3.96">thing just came down does it mean if</text>
  <text start="892.24" dur="4.38">they raise rates it&amp;#39;s gonna come down in</text>

  <text start="902.95" dur="4.65">reports we said once the central bank</text>
  <text start="905.23" dur="4.59">starts raising the rates we know we have</text>

  <text start="909.82" dur="4.56">ceiling like I mentioned earlier is</text>
  <text start="912.46" dur="4.89">coming up so when we put all these</text>
  <text start="914.38" dur="6.45">pieces together it gives us some type of</text>
  <text start="917.35" dur="7.17">signal then the other signal is when we</text>
