  <text start="139.209" dur="5.25">Cabal where they are the ones who</text>
  <text start="142.239" dur="4.291">orchestrated all this there&amp;#39;s no Russian</text>
  <text start="144.459" dur="5.571">collusion all this is completely fake</text>
  <text start="146.53" dur="6.929">phony and false now there was a campaign</text>
  <text start="150.03" dur="6.22">Legal Center which filed a complaint</text>
  <text start="153.459" dur="5.34">with the Federal Election Commission the</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="4.23">FEC alleging that the Democratic</text>
  <text start="158.799" dur="4.171">National Committee and Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.48" dur="4.86">2016 campaign committee violated</text>
  <text start="162.97" dur="4.65">campaign finance law by failing to</text>
  <text start="165.34" dur="4.89">accurately disclose the purpose and</text>
  <text start="167.62" dur="5.22">receipt recipient of payments for the</text>

  <text start="175.269" dur="5.641">and Russia and the CLC&amp;#39;s complaint</text>
  <text start="178.18" dur="4.919">asserts that by effectively hiding these</text>
  <text start="180.91" dur="4.32">payments from public scrutiny the DNC in</text>
  <text start="183.099" dur="3.541">Clinton undermined the vital public</text>
  <text start="185.23" dur="3.99">information role of</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="5.61">campaign disclosures so we already see</text>
  <text start="189.22" dur="5.73">that the FEC might be getting involved</text>
  <text start="192.25" dur="5.43">in this looking into this and it looks</text>
  <text start="194.95" dur="4.32">like everything&amp;#39;s starting to come down</text>
  <text start="197.68" dur="3.12">around this now of course Hillary</text>
  <text start="199.27" dur="4.23">Clinton&amp;#39;s down there you know saying I</text>
  <text start="200.8" dur="5.22">do nothing about this I deny this I have</text>
  <text start="203.5" dur="4.77">no information whatsoever now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.02" dur="5.85">very interesting is the FBI informant</text>
  <text start="208.27" dur="6.719">who was kept silent is now allowed to</text>
  <text start="211.87" dur="5.13">testify in the Clinton era Russian</text>
  <text start="214.989" dur="3.781">bribery with uranium one and remember</text>
  <text start="217" dur="4.95">this was under the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="218.77" dur="6.39">and it looks like right now this</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="5.16">individual is going to testify on what</text>
  <text start="225.16" dur="3.96">really happened in this whole thing so</text>
  <text start="227.11" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of things</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="6.51">come out how far will they get out there</text>
  <text start="232.33" dur="5.189">we don&amp;#39;t know because we understand that</text>
  <text start="235.63" dur="3.93">the Cabal likes to cover things up</text>
  <text start="237.519" dur="4.291">distract people make people look in</text>
  <text start="239.56" dur="4.77">different directions before it gets too</text>
  <text start="241.81" dur="3.81">big and it looks like they might be</text>
  <text start="244.33" dur="4.439">preparing for this which I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="245.62" dur="7.08">discuss in a little bit now Trump he</text>
  <text start="248.769" dur="5.701">vowed to release JFK files and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.7" dur="4.469">keeping some of them back and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.47" dur="4.41">saying he&amp;#39;s backtracking but let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="257.169" dur="4.56">what happens here because White House</text>
  <text start="258.88" dur="5.9">officials explained that around 2,800</text>
  <text start="261.729" dur="5.221">JFK Records will be released today the</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="4.24">publication&amp;#39;s of the remaining records</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="3.719">have been postponed postponed for about</text>
  <text start="269.02" dur="3.6">180 days because the intelligence</text>
  <text start="270.669" dur="4.021">agencies are looking at the documents to</text>
  <text start="272.62" dur="4.26">read redact certain sections now of</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="3.9">course as we know this whole thing was a</text>
  <text start="276.88" dur="4.2">setup are these documents really going</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="4.32">to say anything no I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="3.899">gonna be as important as we all think</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re going to be because I think the</text>
  <text start="284.979" dur="5.851">real information is going to stay hidden</text>
  <text start="287.5" dur="7.41">because this whole thing with JFK this</text>
  <text start="290.83" dur="6.63">was a hit on the president by the Cabal</text>
  <text start="294.91" dur="4.41">and that&amp;#39;s not going to be in these</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="3.57">records it&amp;#39;s going to tell us a lot of</text>
  <text start="299.32" dur="3.81">different things but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.03" dur="5.16">going to point to specific people and</text>
  <text start="303.13" dur="5.76">what really happened we see Twitter</text>
  <text start="306.19" dur="6.12">right now they are saying that they are</text>
  <text start="308.89" dur="5.25">banning RT and Sputnik from advertising</text>
  <text start="312.31" dur="4.95">on their platform and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="314.14" dur="6.09">because Russia was part of hacking the</text>
  <text start="317.26" dur="4.8">2016 US election by placing ads and</text>
  <text start="320.23" dur="4.56">Facebook and Google and everything else</text>
  <text start="322.06" dur="5.37">and once again there is no proof</text>
  <text start="324.79" dur="5.55">whatsoever they&amp;#39;re just doing something</text>
  <text start="327.43" dur="5.76">just to do it and most of these</text>
  <text start="330.34" dur="6.03">companies they have intelligent</text>
  <text start="333.19" dur="6.15">operatives working inside they&amp;#39;re fed</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="5.67">different information and we can see</text>
  <text start="339.34" dur="5.55">that they&amp;#39;re following the Cabal right</text>
  <text start="342.04" dur="5.03">now the corporate media Google YouTube</text>
  <text start="344.89" dur="4.68">most of these type of organizations</text>
  <text start="347.07" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s what they do we see Tillerson</text>
  <text start="349.57" dur="5.61">which is he is the US Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="351.54" dur="5.14">he is scrapping the office within the</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="4.38">State Department that coordinated</text>
  <text start="356.68" dur="6.09">foreign sanctions policies now we know</text>
  <text start="359.56" dur="5.22">that sanctions have been used to have</text>
  <text start="362.77" dur="3.57">regime change to force countries into</text>
  <text start="364.78" dur="4.29">doing things they didn&amp;#39;t want to do now</text>
  <text start="366.34" dur="5.34">the elimination of the sanctions</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="5.13">coordinator appears to be part of the</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="4.29">larger reorganization under why underway</text>
  <text start="374.2" dur="3.87">at the State Department now the</text>
  <text start="375.97" dur="3.66">elimination of the office which was</text>
  <text start="378.07" dur="4.17">created under the former Secretary of</text>
  <text start="379.63" dur="4.77">State Hillary Clinton has driven a wedge</text>
  <text start="382.24" dur="3.93">among former officials and experts</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="4.11">saying no we can&amp;#39;t get rid of this</text>
  <text start="386.17" dur="3.81">because this coordinates all the</text>
  <text start="388.51" dur="2.64">sanctions and I think sanctions are</text>
  <text start="389.98" dur="3.57">going to be a thing of the past because</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="4.68">once the US dollar is no longer the</text>
  <text start="393.55" dur="4.11">reserve currency sanctions aren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="395.83" dur="5.25">to work and as we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past</text>
  <text start="397.66" dur="7.5">sanctions actually really don&amp;#39;t work we</text>
  <text start="401.08" dur="7.62">see almost 1,400 companies have left</text>
  <text start="405.16" dur="5.49">Catalonia since October 2nd and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="408.7" dur="5.13">getting word today that the Catalan</text>
  <text start="410.65" dur="7.11">parliament they&amp;#39;ve declared independence</text>
  <text start="413.83" dur="7.13">from Spain Spain invoked article 155 and</text>
  <text start="417.76" dur="5.46">this is when problems are going to occur</text>
  <text start="420.96" dur="4.06">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the situation very</text>
  <text start="423.22" dur="4.8">carefully we can see that people are</text>
  <text start="425.02" dur="6.65">very angry in Catalonia we see the ECB</text>
  <text start="428.02" dur="5.7">Spain they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="431.67" dur="4.33">whatsoever and they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever</text>
  <text start="433.72" dur="4.02">they have to to stop this and I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="436" dur="5.7">be surprised if we see police and</text>
  <text start="437.74" dur="6.33">military operations on the ground trying</text>
  <text start="441.7" dur="4.38">to stop what is about to happen and the</text>
  <text start="444.07" dur="4.02">people are not going to respond in kind</text>
  <text start="446.08" dur="4.2">with this they&amp;#39;re going to be out there</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="5.759">saying no we want our independence we</text>
  <text start="450.28" dur="5.46">had a vote and under the UN declaration</text>
  <text start="453.849" dur="3.06">we have the right to do this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.74" dur="3.78">gonna have to watch this very very</text>
  <text start="456.909" dur="4.26">carefully to see where this goes out in</text>
  <text start="459.52" dur="4.199">Afghanistan we see something very</text>
  <text start="461.169" dur="4.92">interesting happening here Russia is</text>
  <text start="463.719" dur="4.98">waiting for NATO&amp;#39;s reaction and</text>
  <text start="466.089" dur="4.89">explanation about these helicopters</text>
  <text start="468.699" dur="3.69">without identification marks that were</text>
  <text start="470.979" dur="5.52">seen over the territory of Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="472.389" dur="5.37">and they picked up and they moved the</text>
  <text start="476.499" dur="3.51">terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="477.759" dur="7.02">now they&amp;#39;re saying this came from the</text>
  <text start="480.009" dur="6.9">NATO area they track them and NATO needs</text>
  <text start="484.779" dur="3.9">to respond of what they were doing there</text>
  <text start="486.909" dur="3.6">why they were picking up the terrorist</text>
  <text start="488.679" dur="4.53">groups where they were bringing them</text>
  <text start="490.509" dur="5.731">because the helicopters originated from</text>
  <text start="493.209" dur="4.5">a NATO base so this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="496.24" dur="3.239">and we know that the United States</text>
  <text start="497.709" dur="5.73">government the central bankers the Cabal</text>
  <text start="499.479" dur="6.9">they used helicopters to pick up the</text>
  <text start="503.439" dur="5.58">Islamic state al-qaeda the moderate</text>
  <text start="506.379" dur="4.981">rebels in Syria in Iraq and move them to</text>
  <text start="509.019" dur="4.921">different locations we see the same</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="5.7">thing happening out in Afghanistan so</text>
  <text start="513.94" dur="6.029">once again where all these terrorists</text>
  <text start="517.06" dur="6.359">coming from they&amp;#39;re coming from NATO the</text>
  <text start="519.969" dur="6.001">Cabal the coalition forces they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="523.419" dur="5.22">ones who are controlling all of this we</text>
  <text start="525.97" dur="5.52">see Russia opposes the latest massive</text>
  <text start="528.639" dur="6.12">us-led war games in the waters off of</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="5.459">Korea there&amp;#39;s about 40 ships from the US</text>

  <text start="538.449" dur="4.981">Strike Group and basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.3" dur="4.62">doing there is they are provoking North</text>
  <text start="543.43" dur="5.13">Korea right now and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="5.64">get North Korea to do something we see</text>

  <text start="666.209" dur="5.791">of information is coming out today about</text>
  <text start="669.36" dur="5.159">Clinton the uranium one deal there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="672" dur="5.13">huge investigation going on we know the</text>
  <text start="674.519" dur="4.831">House Judiciary Committee they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="677.13" dur="5.129">looking into this Trey Gowdy&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="679.35" dur="4.799">into this and a lot of this information</text>
  <text start="682.259" dur="5.401">is coming out and we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="684.149" dur="6.231">about an event of all events that might</text>
  <text start="687.66" dur="6.659">be coming a distraction to get this off</text>
  <text start="690.38" dur="6.309">the news stations or off the alternative</text>
  <text start="694.319" dur="4.801">media or to block this all out somehow</text>
  <text start="696.689" dur="4.921">some way by using some type of wag the</text>
  <text start="699.12" dur="4.68">dog technique of a distraction now</text>
  <text start="701.61" dur="3.63">what&amp;#39;s very interesting and we also know</text>
  <text start="703.8" dur="2.88">that the economy is coming down and</text>
  <text start="705.24" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re running out of time because</text>
  <text start="706.68" dur="6.199">they&amp;#39;re losing the middlee so what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="709.11" dur="6.719">seen right now is that there&amp;#39;s an FBI</text>
  <text start="712.879" dur="6.07">simulated terrorist attack that is</text>
  <text start="715.829" dur="4.441">taking place in a theme park in Virginia</text>
  <text start="718.949" dur="3.51">now</text>
  <text start="720.27" dur="5.58">local residents were born to expect the</text>
  <text start="722.459" dur="7.651">sounds of sirens helicopters and fake</text>
  <text start="725.85" dur="6.33">gunfire and the FBI took over a very</text>
  <text start="730.11" dur="5.01">large amusement park in Virginia called</text>
  <text start="732.18" dur="7.26">Kings Dominion and they started to</text>
  <text start="735.12" dur="7.62">practice this type of false flag event</text>
  <text start="739.44" dur="5.73">now of course they&amp;#39;re practicing for an</text>
  <text start="742.74" dur="6.57">event that might occur in amusement park</text>
  <text start="745.17" dur="6.84">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before we saw it</text>
  <text start="749.31" dur="5.19">happen in a mall where they practice</text>
  <text start="752.01" dur="6.54">first and then it played out exactly the</text>
  <text start="754.5" dur="5.76">way they practice and most likely we</text>
  <text start="758.55" dur="4.2">will see the same thing now what happens</text>
  <text start="760.26" dur="4.139">during this period of time they film all</text>
  <text start="762.75" dur="3.8">of this they have all the actors they</text>
  <text start="764.399" dur="4.981">have the blood that people made up and</text>
  <text start="766.55" dur="4.599">during the simulations they make it look</text>
  <text start="769.38" dur="3.99">real they have all the rescue services</text>
  <text start="771.149" dur="3.75">and they take the pictures they film</text>
  <text start="773.37" dur="4.56">everything at this point in time and</text>
  <text start="774.899" dur="6.181">then they use these pictures later on</text>
  <text start="777.93" dur="5.73">when they have the false flags because</text>
  <text start="781.08" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re using explosives right now</text>
  <text start="783.66" dur="5.669">they&amp;#39;re using active shooters they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="786.87" dur="4.589">using gunfire you&amp;#39;re gonna hear the</text>
  <text start="789.329" dur="6.871">gunfire you&amp;#39;re gonna see all of this</text>
  <text start="791.459" dur="6.87">stuff happen so the question is is this</text>
  <text start="796.2" dur="4.889">the next biggest thing because this</text>
  <text start="798.329" dur="4.351">would scare a lot of people there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="801.089" dur="3.361">lot of people around they use concerts</text>
  <text start="802.68" dur="3.899">before where there&amp;#39;s a lot of people</text>
  <text start="804.45" dur="4.889">around and they can make the case that</text>
  <text start="806.579" dur="6.541">yeah look they&amp;#39;re hitting concerts now</text>
  <text start="809.339" dur="7.711">now an amusement park is a very big area</text>
  <text start="813.12" dur="5.73">there&amp;#39;s a lot of families there and they</text>
  <text start="817.05" dur="4.11">can make this look really really great</text>
  <text start="818.85" dur="4.02">the Vegas one didn&amp;#39;t go as well as they</text>
  <text start="821.16" dur="3.54">planned I think they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="822.87" dur="3.51">something even bigger this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="824.7" dur="3.66">seeing this happen is it gonna happen</text>
  <text start="826.38" dur="4.26">tomorrow maybe not maybe it&amp;#39;ll happen</text>
  <text start="828.36" dur="4.32">later on maybe in a month or two that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="830.64" dur="4.98">when it usually happens but you could</text>
  <text start="832.68" dur="6.33">see right now that we&amp;#39;re following this</text>
  <text start="835.62" dur="5.85">and we&amp;#39;re trying to show that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="839.01" dur="5.37">been practicing this and what are the</text>
  <text start="841.47" dur="5.309">chances that something is going to</text>
  <text start="844.38" dur="4.649">happen in an amusement park you know</text>
  <text start="846.779" dur="4.951">month two months four months five months</text>
  <text start="849.029" dur="4.771">later I mean is this a coincidence I</text>
  <text start="851.73" dur="4.14">think not this</text>
  <text start="853.8" dur="5.039">again as we know is completely planned</text>
  <text start="855.87" dur="6.029">and we want to make sure that we</text>
  <text start="858.839" dur="4.891">understand how this is all being done</text>
  <text start="861.899" dur="5.821">because we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="863.73" dur="7.56">so right now as the news comes out and</text>
  <text start="867.72" dur="6.03">the investigations start into the Cabal</text>
  <text start="871.29" dur="3.66">and the intelligent agencies get dragged</text>
  <text start="873.75" dur="2.55">into this because they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="874.95" dur="3.42">because remember they&amp;#39;re gonna follow</text>
  <text start="876.3" dur="3.15">the money they&amp;#39;re gonna follow all the</text>
  <text start="878.37" dur="2.82">paperwork they&amp;#39;re gonna follow</text>
  <text start="879.45" dur="4.02">everything and it&amp;#39;s going to lead them</text>
  <text start="881.19" dur="3.78">into many different areas and a lot of</text>
  <text start="883.47" dur="4.32">people are going to be brought into this</text>
  <text start="884.97" dur="5.13">and they&amp;#39;re gonna have to explain why</text>
  <text start="887.79" dur="5.789">they were a part of this just like right</text>
  <text start="890.1" dur="5.489">before the Trade Center 9/11 we had ten</text>
  <text start="893.579" dur="4.231">trillion dollars missing from the</text>
  <text start="895.589" dur="4.021">Pentagon and they started their</text>
  <text start="897.81" dur="4.019">investigation and it just so happened</text>
  <text start="899.61" dur="3.719">that part of the Pentagon where the</text>
  <text start="901.829" dur="3.931">investigation in the accounting records</text>
  <text start="903.329" dur="4.26">were held that was destroyed certain</text>
  <text start="905.76" dur="4.11">buildings were destroyed where they had</text>
  <text start="907.589" dur="4.141">evidence and we&amp;#39;re probably gonna see</text>
  <text start="909.87" dur="3.899">the same thing happen once again where</text>
  <text start="911.73" dur="4.799">they&amp;#39;re gonna use this wag the dog type</text>
  <text start="913.769" dur="4.771">of distraction have an event of all</text>
  <text start="916.529" dur="4.351">events mable happen in multiple</text>
  <text start="918.54" dur="3.539">amusement parks we don&amp;#39;t know because</text>
  <text start="920.88" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;re training for it right now</text>
  <text start="922.079" dur="3.211">they&amp;#39;re simulating a right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="923.61" dur="3.9">taking the pictures they&amp;#39;re making it</text>
  <text start="925.29" dur="4.85">look as real as possible they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="927.51" dur="7.139">blood they&amp;#39;re using amputees they put</text>
  <text start="930.14" dur="6.67">fake bones and it looks like their legs</text>
  <text start="934.649" dur="4.801">were blown off so I&amp;#39;m expecting</text>
  <text start="936.81" dur="5.58">something really big to happen here</text>
  <text start="939.45" dur="5.67">because this is a very big operation</text>
  <text start="942.39" dur="4.5">where they&amp;#39;re having this simulation and</text>
  <text start="945.12" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;ve seen these simulations before</text>
  <text start="946.89" dur="7.25">especially in schools where they would</text>
  <text start="949.32" dur="8.55">have a simulated attack in a school</text>
  <text start="954.14" dur="6.189">maybe you know 5060 miles away and then</text>
  <text start="957.87" dur="4.38">it would happen in another school well</text>
  <text start="960.329" dur="3.811">we might see the same exact thing and</text>
