  <text start="136.13" dur="2.97">about</text>
  <text start="136.73" dur="6.81">because remember this entire system is</text>
  <text start="139.1" dur="7.29">designed to help the central bankers</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="5.43">help the deep state it was not designed</text>
  <text start="146.39" dur="5.159">to help the people and what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="148.97" dur="4.92">right now it&amp;#39;s being dismantled one</text>
  <text start="151.549" dur="6.541">piece at a time and the only way to do</text>
  <text start="153.89" dur="7.159">this is to completely collapse the</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="8.399">system and while you&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="161.049" dur="7.391">redesign the entire system in the way it</text>
  <text start="166.489" dur="4.021">works because it was designed in a</text>
  <text start="168.44" dur="4.32">certain way and this way was the</text>
  <text start="170.51" dur="4.58">globalist system now we&amp;#39;re taking it all</text>
  <text start="172.76" dur="5.4">apart dismantling it one piece at a time</text>
  <text start="175.09" dur="4.869">I&amp;#39;m redesigning it and while you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.16" dur="4.02">doing this you&amp;#39;re gonna hear the</text>
  <text start="179.959" dur="3.841">mainstream media the central bankers all</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="3.48">of them out there saying that you know</text>
  <text start="183.8" dur="2.909">this is going to destroy the entire</text>
  <text start="185.66" dur="3.57">system and of course</text>
  <text start="186.709" dur="4.59">yes it is that&amp;#39;s the whole point of this</text>
  <text start="189.23" dur="4.47">but we need to understand what is</text>
  <text start="191.299" dur="4.8">happening under the hood we need to</text>
  <text start="193.7" dur="4.14">understand exactly what this plan is so</text>
  <text start="196.099" dur="4.741">it&amp;#39;s a little bit clearer to everyone</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="4.679">why it is happening this way and why</text>
  <text start="200.84" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re talking about trade wars and</text>
  <text start="202.519" dur="6.12">tariffs and why Trump and those Patriots</text>
  <text start="206.12" dur="5.13">are doing this and you&amp;#39;re doing this for</text>
  <text start="208.639" dur="5.91">a simple reason everything that was</text>
  <text start="211.25" dur="5.969">designed and built and created was for a</text>
  <text start="214.549" dur="4.8">very specific type of economy and that</text>
  <text start="217.219" dur="5.761">was a central bank globalist type of</text>
  <text start="219.349" dur="7.47">system everything now is being redone</text>
  <text start="222.98" dur="5.819">for a system that will benefit the</text>
  <text start="226.819" dur="3.5">people let&amp;#39;s take a look at what the</text>
  <text start="228.799" dur="4.44">Federal Reserve is doing right now</text>
  <text start="230.319" dur="5.741">they&amp;#39;ve dropped interest rates since</text>
  <text start="233.239" dur="5.911">2008 now since they dropped interest</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="6.929">rates has this helped the everyday</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="5.929">person well know the savings people</text>
  <text start="242.989" dur="5.491">aren&amp;#39;t making interest on their savings</text>
  <text start="245.079" dur="5.47">the pension system that is not working</text>
  <text start="248.48" dur="4.349">out well because they thought they were</text>
  <text start="250.549" dur="3.541">going to be getting 78% interest this is</text>
  <text start="252.829" dur="4.08">what they based the entire pension</text>
  <text start="254.09" dur="6.119">system off of and it really hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="256.909" dur="5.94">helped the everyday person now has it</text>
  <text start="260.209" dur="5.871">helped the banks yes it has it gave them</text>
  <text start="262.849" dur="8.011">easy money it gave them the ability to</text>
  <text start="266.08" dur="6.55">borrow at no interest whatsoever now</text>
  <text start="270.86" dur="5.1">where these banks loaning people money</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="5.49">not really so let&amp;#39;s take a look at</text>
  <text start="275.96" dur="6.239">interest rates going back in time for a</text>
  <text start="278.12" dur="5.789">sec here and the 1980s sharply higher</text>
  <text start="282.199" dur="3.771">interest rates during the term of the</text>
  <text start="283.909" dur="4.081">Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker</text>
  <text start="285.97" dur="5.08">essentially destroyed the housing</text>
  <text start="287.99" dur="5.16">finance sector in the u.s. fixed rate</text>
  <text start="291.05" dur="4.649">mortgages and rising interest expenses</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="4.65">led to widespread insolvency in the</text>
  <text start="295.699" dur="4.581">Savings and Loan sector that cost US</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="7.26">taxpayers hundreds of billions in losses</text>
  <text start="300.28" dur="7.359">since the 2008 crisis the Fed the ECB</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="4.53">and Bank of Japan Japan have suppressed</text>
  <text start="307.639" dur="4.59">the cost of funds providing enormous</text>
  <text start="309.59" dur="5.31">subsidy to bank equity holders and</text>
  <text start="312.229" dur="5.55">debtors at the expense of individual</text>
  <text start="314.9" dur="5.67">savers and bond investors in 2015 for</text>
  <text start="317.779" dur="6.301">example the cost of funds for the 15</text>
  <text start="320.57" dur="6.39">in the u.s. bank assets fell to just 11</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="4.77">billion per quarter prior to 2008 that</text>
  <text start="326.96" dur="4.74">number for quarterly interest expense</text>
  <text start="328.85" dur="6.3">was close to a hundred billion with the</text>
  <text start="331.7" dur="5.31">Fed now tightening its policy both by</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="3.99">raising the target for short-term</text>
  <text start="337.01" dur="5.01">interest rates and by allowing its</text>
  <text start="339.14" dur="6.06">balance sheet to shrink u.s. banks are</text>
  <text start="342.02" dur="5.4">facing the prospect of rising interest</text>
  <text start="345.2" dur="5.52">expense and shrinking net interest</text>
  <text start="347.42" dur="7.14">margins now based upon projections by</text>
  <text start="350.72" dur="6.3">well and Global Advisors net interest</text>
  <text start="354.56" dur="5.43">income for all US banks will cease</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="5.43">growing by year-end and will be visibly</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="5.94">declining in the first quarter of 2019</text>
  <text start="362.45" dur="5.28">in the event the superficial narrative</text>
  <text start="365.93" dur="3.72">powered by Wall Street punnets that</text>
  <text start="367.73" dur="3.99">rising interest rates are good for banks</text>
  <text start="369.65" dur="3.3">and other leverage investors will be</text>
  <text start="371.72" dur="4.14">shown to be complete</text>
  <text start="372.95" dur="4.68">nonsense now the banking profits since</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="6.12">2008 have been supported by cheap</text>
  <text start="377.63" dur="6.63">funding not robust asset returns simply</text>
  <text start="381.98" dur="4.67">stated banks in the US are about to get</text>
  <text start="384.26" dur="6.27">caught in an interest rate squeeze of</text>
  <text start="386.65" dur="6.67">gigantic proportions and of course for</text>
  <text start="390.53" dur="6.78">the banks to avoid this what does the</text>
  <text start="393.32" dur="7.64">Fed need to do well they need to sell</text>
  <text start="397.31" dur="6.36">long term securities essentially reverse</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="5.5">Operation Twist now are they going to do</text>
  <text start="403.67" dur="4.98">this most likely not now</text>
  <text start="406.46" dur="4.41">if the Fed does continue to do</text>
  <text start="408.65" dur="5.13">absolutely nothing and they use this</text>
  <text start="410.87" dur="5.16">approach for policy normalization then</text>
  <text start="413.78" dur="3.69">we are likely to see an inverted yield</text>
  <text start="416.03" dur="4.59">curve what are we seeing right now a</text>
  <text start="417.47" dur="7.77">flattening yield curve which eventually</text>
  <text start="420.62" dur="6.57">will invert once this happens there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="4.32">going to be a sell-off in global equity</text>
  <text start="427.19" dur="4.29">markets led by financials and finally</text>
  <text start="429.56" dur="4.5">shrimp shrinking profits in the US</text>
  <text start="431.48" dur="5.46">banking system early next year these</text>
  <text start="434.06" dur="6.51">three eventualities may very well ensure</text>
  <text start="436.94" dur="6.09">that 2019 is a recession year in the US</text>
  <text start="440.57" dur="4.86">now we know that Trump was out there</text>
  <text start="443.03" dur="4.17">saying listen I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="445.43" dur="3.42">time to raise interest rates and he</text>
  <text start="447.2" dur="3.78">criticized the Fed but he said that the</text>
  <text start="448.85" dur="3.39">feds doing what they know best are doing</text>
  <text start="450.98" dur="2.909">it for the country and we know that the</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="3.899">Fed does nothing for</text>
  <text start="453.889" dur="5.28">country the central banking system does</text>
  <text start="456.139" dur="5.58">everything for themselves but we need to</text>
  <text start="459.169" dur="5.22">understand the whole motive behind all</text>
  <text start="461.719" dur="5.88">this Trump wants them to raise interest</text>
  <text start="464.389" dur="7.201">rates even though he&amp;#39;s out there saying</text>
  <text start="467.599" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s not a good time the message is we</text>
  <text start="471.59" dur="4.859">want you to do this I believe that</text>
  <text start="474.409" dur="5.04">Powell and Trump are working together I</text>
  <text start="476.449" dur="6.06">believe right now that this is the plan</text>
  <text start="479.449" dur="5.52">for the Fed to raise the rates because</text>
  <text start="482.509" dur="4.38">they know it will bring down the banking</text>
  <text start="484.969" dur="5.1">system it will bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="486.889" dur="6.81">and it will be blamed on the central</text>
  <text start="490.069" dur="6.12">bank while this is happening remember</text>
  <text start="493.699" dur="4.981">Trump and those behind supporting them</text>
  <text start="496.189" dur="5.671">what they&amp;#39;ve done here is they&amp;#39;ve placed</text>
  <text start="498.68" dur="7.049">tariffs on certain industries especially</text>
  <text start="501.86" dur="6.57">China and he&amp;#39;s criticizing certain</text>
  <text start="505.729" dur="5.61">companies like harley-davidson Apple and</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="4.83">many many others saying listen you know</text>
  <text start="511.339" dur="4.051">if you want to avoid these tariffs you</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="5.819">should bring your operations back to the</text>
  <text start="515.39" dur="7.019">US why is he doing this the tariffs are</text>
  <text start="519.079" dur="6.361">to keep companies from moving out of</text>
  <text start="522.409" dur="6.331">this country and it&amp;#39;s to bring companies</text>
  <text start="525.44" dur="5.49">back to this country and will it all</text>
  <text start="528.74" dur="4.44">happen at once no there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="3.87">bumps in the road where companies gonna</text>
  <text start="533.18" dur="4.2">say well it doesn&amp;#39;t look like it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="534.8" dur="6.149">good situation for us and we most likely</text>
  <text start="537.38" dur="6.36">should maybe bring our operations out to</text>
  <text start="540.949" dur="6.151">a different country so what Trump does</text>
  <text start="543.74" dur="5.789">is he starts placing tariffs on another</text>
  <text start="547.1" dur="4.919">economic industry and another industry</text>
  <text start="549.529" dur="4.92">and another industry where these</text>
  <text start="552.019" dur="5.611">companies will eventually have no choice</text>
  <text start="554.449" dur="5.521">but to come back to the US basically</text>
  <text start="557.63" dur="5.31">making it impossible for these companies</text>
  <text start="559.97" dur="4.65">to operate outside of the US because</text>
  <text start="562.94" dur="4.009">it&amp;#39;s too expensive and to force them</text>
  <text start="564.62" dur="5.579">back into the US that&amp;#39;s what these</text>
  <text start="566.949" dur="5.771">tariffs are all about now China and</text>
  <text start="570.199" dur="5.82">Russia they&amp;#39;re be that they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="572.72" dur="6.179">with Trump on this now remember during</text>
  <text start="576.019" dur="4.951">the period of the globalists and the</text>
  <text start="578.899" dur="4.081">central bank their plan was to move the</text>
  <text start="580.97" dur="3.359">entire operation out to try and remember</text>
  <text start="582.98" dur="4.59">there is a deep state central bank</text>
  <text start="584.329" dur="5.07">system in each one of these countries</text>
  <text start="587.57" dur="5.759">we can see that Xi Jinping and Putin</text>
  <text start="589.399" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re working against those factions</text>
  <text start="593.329" dur="5.581">the central bank&amp;#39;s the deep state and</text>
  <text start="596.209" dur="4.8">remember their plan was to move</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="5.07">everything out into the China Russia</text>
  <text start="601.009" dur="5.221">area and what is happening right now is</text>
  <text start="603.98" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re trying to reverse everything</text>
  <text start="606.23" dur="5.01">that was happening prior to all of this</text>
  <text start="608.75" dur="5.339">now the central bank the IMF and the</text>
  <text start="611.24" dur="5.039">rest have been telling us that global</text>
  <text start="614.089" dur="5.391">growth is slowing and this is because of</text>
  <text start="616.279" dur="5.761">Trump and his tariffs not necessarily</text>
  <text start="619.48" dur="5.65">global growth was slowing way before</text>
  <text start="622.04" dur="4.859">this they knew this they wanted an event</text>
  <text start="625.13" dur="3.6">they wanted to cover it up but they</text>
  <text start="626.899" dur="3.391">couldn&amp;#39;t so now they just said okay</text>
  <text start="628.73" dur="5.159">global growth is slow and because of</text>
  <text start="630.29" dur="7.859">these tariffs well what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="633.889" dur="7.771">here is that global trade is declining</text>
  <text start="638.149" dur="7.67">it has been for quite a while global</text>
  <text start="641.66" dur="7.679">trade is declining because the entire</text>
  <text start="645.819" dur="5.591">central bank system is imploding on</text>
  <text start="649.339" dur="5.31">itself and it has been for a very long</text>
  <text start="651.41" dur="6.81">time supply chains right right now are</text>
  <text start="654.649" dur="7.05">seizing up and we can see that the world</text>
  <text start="658.22" dur="4.859">trade monitor compiled by the C P B the</text>
  <text start="661.699" dur="3.931">Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy</text>
  <text start="663.079" dur="4.861">Analysis show the rolling three-month</text>
  <text start="665.63" dur="4.319">trade volumes are not only declined but</text>
  <text start="667.94" dur="4.8">if entered into negative territory and</text>
  <text start="669.949" dur="5.311">ominous harbinger of economic trouble</text>
  <text start="672.74" dur="5.579">now remember this has been going on for</text>
  <text start="675.26" dur="4.86">quite a while this is nothing new the</text>
  <text start="678.319" dur="4.14">whole things just being sped up right</text>
  <text start="680.12" dur="4.8">now because they have no way out of this</text>
  <text start="682.459" dur="5.221">situation so let&amp;#39;s back up for a second</text>
  <text start="684.92" dur="5.909">here and see the plan that is in motion</text>
  <text start="687.68" dur="5.459">right now Trump the Patriots they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="690.829" dur="4.921">been using the same manipulation that</text>
  <text start="693.139" dur="5.13">Obama the central bank&amp;#39;s have used over</text>
  <text start="695.75" dur="4.62">the many many years to make it look like</text>
  <text start="698.269" dur="5.06">the economy&amp;#39;s doing well so what Trump</text>
  <text start="700.37" dur="4.74">and the Patriots have done is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="703.329" dur="4.12">accelerated the process they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="705.11" dur="4.469">manipulated this economy to the enth</text>
  <text start="707.449" dur="5.19">degree to make it look like the economy</text>
  <text start="709.579" dur="3.63">is unbelievable right now and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="712.639" dur="2.94">way it&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="713.209" dur="3.331">now the deep state the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="715.579" dur="3.271">they&amp;#39;re not going to come out and say</text>
  <text start="716.54" dur="4.47">hey you know something this is not a</text>
  <text start="718.85" dur="4.5">real economy it&amp;#39;s fake</text>
  <text start="721.01" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s manipulated because all Trump</text>
  <text start="723.35" dur="2.7">has to do is turn around saying well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="724.64" dur="3.27">using the same calculations you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="726.05" dur="3.42">using how can you say it&amp;#39;s manipulated</text>
  <text start="727.91" dur="4.17">so they&amp;#39;re not gonna go down that path</text>
  <text start="729.47" dur="4.71">Obama did come out and say hey wait a</text>
  <text start="732.08" dur="3.99">minute I&amp;#39;m the one who started this so</text>
  <text start="734.18" dur="3.75">this is really my economy he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="736.07" dur="4.32">gain ground over here but we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="737.93" dur="4.62">about that a little while so he&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="740.39" dur="5.67">manipulation to make the economy look</text>
  <text start="742.55" dur="6.09">like it&amp;#39;s doing fantastically during</text>
  <text start="746.06" dur="6.21">this period of time and before this time</text>
  <text start="748.64" dur="6.6">Trump has been getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="752.27" dur="6.9">globalists trade system TPP cut it right</text>
  <text start="755.24" dur="5.46">down NAFTA renegotiated started to have</text>
  <text start="759.17" dur="4.38">bilateral trades with many different</text>
  <text start="760.7" dur="6.3">countries started to place tariffs on</text>
  <text start="763.55" dur="6.84">China and other countries for certain</text>
  <text start="767" dur="7.47">economic industries and expanded over</text>
  <text start="770.39" dur="6.09">time why well to force companies back to</text>
  <text start="774.47" dur="4.53">the US and to stop companies from</text>
  <text start="776.48" dur="5.22">leaving the US this is being done on</text>
  <text start="779" dur="5.34">purpose trying to bring everything back</text>
  <text start="781.7" dur="4.46">to the United States so companies</text>
  <text start="784.34" dur="5.28">looking to leave will stay in the US</text>
  <text start="786.16" dur="6.07">this will take some time of course we</text>
  <text start="789.62" dur="3.84">can&amp;#39;t rebuild this in a split second</text>
  <text start="792.23" dur="3.09">because a lot of the infrastructure is</text>
  <text start="793.46" dur="3.99">not here anymore a lot of the companies</text>
  <text start="795.32" dur="3.81">have been moved out of the US so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="797.45" dur="4.17">going to take time to bring companies</text>
  <text start="799.13" dur="5.34">back Trump is gonna have to change tax</text>
  <text start="801.62" dur="5.25">regulations for corporations to bring</text>
  <text start="804.47" dur="4.41">them back to the country to make it look</text>
  <text start="806.87" dur="5.85">you know to make it better for the</text>
  <text start="808.88" dur="6.66">companies to bring them back here so</text>
  <text start="812.72" dur="6.66">they can create the jobs here to create</text>
  <text start="815.54" dur="6.78">manufacturing here and China and Russia</text>
  <text start="819.38" dur="5.6">as we know if they are in on the deal so</text>
  <text start="822.32" dur="5.52">everything is being reversed right now</text>
  <text start="824.98" dur="5.68">tariffs are being placed on certain</text>
  <text start="827.84" dur="5.61">sectors and he&amp;#39;ll expand this overtime</text>
  <text start="830.66" dur="4.62">even though the central bank and all the</text>
  <text start="833.45" dur="4.05">others are saying oh this is a gigantic</text>
  <text start="835.28" dur="4.77">trade war no this is orchestrated with</text>
  <text start="837.5" dur="6.15">Russia and China it&amp;#39;s all being done at</text>
  <text start="840.05" dur="5.64">the same time and at the same time Trump</text>
  <text start="843.65" dur="3.42">is criticizing the Fed about raising the</text>
  <text start="845.69" dur="3.54">rates and things like that so when you</text>
  <text start="847.07" dur="5.13">put everything all together you can see</text>
  <text start="849.23" dur="5.63">the plan in the way in what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="852.2" dur="5.15">trying to do here they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="854.86" dur="4.74">bring the country back to where it was</text>
  <text start="857.35" dur="4.53">now can they do this in this short</text>
  <text start="859.6" dur="3.9">period of time and transition us and do</text>
  <text start="861.88" dur="3.81">everything know what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="863.5" dur="4.83">here is he needs to get rid of as much</text>
  <text start="865.69" dur="5.07">as he possibly can and bring as much as</text>
  <text start="868.33" dur="5.01">he possibly can and set up these tariffs</text>
  <text start="870.76" dur="4.83">to stop other companies from leaving and</text>
  <text start="873.34" dur="6.42">hopefully bring the other companies back</text>
  <text start="875.59" dur="7.41">into this country this is working jobs</text>
  <text start="879.76" dur="5.25">will be coming back in the meantime we</text>
  <text start="883" dur="3.87">need to get rid of this system that</text>
  <text start="885.01" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re in this is a central banking</text>
  <text start="886.87" dur="4.8">system and this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="889.9" dur="3.9">right now so we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot</text>
  <text start="891.67" dur="5.34">happening all at once we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="893.8" dur="7.02">more tariffs we&amp;#39;re gonna see the Fed</text>
  <text start="897.01" dur="5.82">raise the rates we&amp;#39;re gonna see the</text>
  <text start="900.82" dur="4.11">economy start to fall apart this is the</text>
  <text start="902.83" dur="4.89">people&amp;#39;s economy and this has got all</text>
  <text start="904.93" dur="5.1">going to happen at the same time and the</text>
  <text start="907.72" dur="4.44">system will eventually implode on itself</text>
  <text start="910.03" dur="4.53">now of course what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="912.16" dur="5.1">Trump is gonna point to the Fed or if</text>
  <text start="914.56" dur="4.53">the news comes out that these</text>
  <text start="917.26" dur="5">individuals in the past were corrupt</text>
  <text start="919.09" dur="6.18">that might also bring down the system so</text>
  <text start="922.26" dur="5.56">Trump looks to control the narrative he</text>
  <text start="925.27" dur="4.98">if he controls the narrative he will</text>
  <text start="927.82" dur="5.37">control the transition he will control</text>
  <text start="930.25" dur="4.68">what happens next and it looks like they</text>
  <text start="933.19" dur="4.47">are gaining this control and by</text>
  <text start="934.93" dur="6.27">dismantling everything else it will make</text>
  <text start="937.66" dur="7.71">it a lot easier to transition us into</text>
  <text start="941.2" dur="6.06">the next system now the u.s. eventually</text>
  <text start="945.37" dur="4.11">will no longer be the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="947.26" dur="2.91">this most likely will move someplace</text>
  <text start="949.48" dur="4.86">else</text>
  <text start="950.17" dur="7.08">backed by gold and China right now is</text>
  <text start="954.34" dur="5.28">setting up the world trade system the</text>
  <text start="957.25" dur="5.33">Silk Road the one belt one road system</text>
  <text start="959.62" dur="6.03">the US will eventually join this and</text>
  <text start="962.58" dur="4.78">this is a peaceful system where</text>
  <text start="965.65" dur="3.33">everyone&amp;#39;s going to trade peacefully</text>
  <text start="967.36" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s not going to be done by force</text>
  <text start="968.98" dur="7.11">having military come in nothing like</text>
  <text start="971.83" dur="5.97">that so this whole entire plan is one to</text>
  <text start="976.09" dur="3.21">make everyone believe I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="977.8" dur="3.33">the deep state the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="979.3" dur="4.11">the rest of the sleeping people that the</text>
  <text start="981.13" dur="4.71">economy is doing well the mainstream</text>
  <text start="983.41" dur="4.85">media can&amp;#39;t really say anything place</text>
  <text start="985.84" dur="4.1">tariffs to stop companies from lis</text>
  <text start="988.26" dur="4.59">and bring companies back and place more</text>
  <text start="989.94" dur="5.01">tariffs on certain industries to even to</text>
  <text start="992.85" dur="4.86">bring companies back here change the</text>
  <text start="994.95" dur="3.99">regulations to make it a lot easier for</text>
  <text start="997.71" dur="3.72">companies to come back here where</text>
  <text start="998.94" dur="6.11">they&amp;#39;re not tax a lot this way they can</text>
  <text start="1001.43" dur="7.29">set up shop build the infrastructure and</text>
  <text start="1005.05" dur="6.54">bring jobs back to the US and then</text>
  <text start="1008.72" dur="6.9">eventually down the whole system and</text>
  <text start="1011.59" dur="6.16">reboot it or reset it and get rid of the</text>
  <text start="1015.62" dur="4.2">central bank system this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1017.75" dur="4.74">seeing play out right now and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
