  <text start="59.24" dur="7.41">episode 1590 APN today&amp;#39;s date is June</text>
  <text start="63.2" dur="8.48">22nd 2018 and the top of the episode is</text>
  <text start="66.65" dur="7.59">it&amp;#39;s all about to change the time is now</text>
  <text start="71.68" dur="4.72">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="74.24" dur="4.35">political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="76.4" dur="4.35">now since this Inspector General report</text>
  <text start="78.59" dur="4.23">came out we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="80.75" dur="4.41">things happen all at once</text>
  <text start="82.82" dur="5.299">cue has been telling us that it is time</text>
  <text start="85.16" dur="6.39">right now and things are about to change</text>
  <text start="88.119" dur="4.811">we see special agent Peter struck well</text>
  <text start="91.55" dur="2.13">he&amp;#39;s been stripped of his security</text>
  <text start="92.93" dur="3.18">clearance</text>
  <text start="93.68" dur="5.31">he was also physically escorted out of</text>
  <text start="96.11" dur="5.94">the FBI office and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="98.99" dur="7.46">Attorney General Jeff Sessions we also</text>
  <text start="102.05" dur="8.819">see that in the case of Michael Flynn</text>
  <text start="106.45" dur="7.059">the FBI may have meddled with the</text>
  <text start="110.869" dur="4.291">evidence now there are certain</text>
  <text start="113.509" dur="4.561">congressmen that are looking at this and</text>
  <text start="115.16" dur="6.21">saying yeah we might have a problem here</text>
  <text start="118.07" dur="7.38">and we know with the 302s the summer</text>
  <text start="121.37" dur="6.809">reports they have been modified and now</text>
  <text start="125.45" dur="4.68">u.s. congressman mark meadows he</text>
  <text start="128.179" dur="3.211">suggested that the FBI may have meddled</text>
  <text start="130.13" dur="2.7">with evidence in the case against</text>
  <text start="131.39" dur="5.099">Trump&amp;#39;s former national security adviser</text>
  <text start="132.83" dur="8.67">Michael Flynn and we know from Q&amp;#39;s posts</text>
  <text start="136.489" dur="6.961">that Flynn will be free in 30 and it</text>
  <text start="141.5" dur="5.16">looks like this might be coming true</text>
  <text start="143.45" dur="5.61">where they show that there is no</text>
  <text start="146.66" dur="4.94">evidence or a case against Michael Flynn</text>
  <text start="149.06" dur="5.64">and we see that Mueller&amp;#39;s case against</text>
  <text start="151.6" dur="6.01">individuals it&amp;#39;s not going the way the</text>
  <text start="154.7" dur="5.25">deep state wants because most of it is</text>
  <text start="157.61" dur="5.01">made-up it&amp;#39;s propaganda and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="159.95" dur="6.39">falling apart we see Senate Judiciary</text>
  <text start="162.62" dur="6.45">Chairman Chuck Grassley says he&amp;#39;ll issue</text>
  <text start="166.34" dur="5.16">subpoenas for FBI director James Comey</text>
  <text start="169.07" dur="5.46">in a former attorney general Loretta</text>
  <text start="171.5" dur="6.57">Lynch but the panel&amp;#39;s top Democrat</text>
  <text start="174.53" dur="6.69">Dianne Feinstein has to agree to it /</text>
  <text start="178.07" dur="5.279">committee rules and he said well if she</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="5.46">agrees we will subpoena them now the</text>
  <text start="183.349" dur="4.181">question is will she sign off on this</text>
  <text start="186.68" dur="3.7">and agree to it</text>
  <text start="187.53" dur="5.82">well she might be hesitant to sign on</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="5.01">now she says she thinks Comey acted in</text>
  <text start="193.35" dur="3.9">good faith which means she thinks</text>
  <text start="195.39" dur="4.68">Congress shouldn&amp;#39;t have a crack at</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="5.84">questioning a key figure in the largest</text>
  <text start="200.07" dur="7.17">political scandal in modern history and</text>
  <text start="203.09" dur="6.43">basically I think that they should be</text>
  <text start="207.24" dur="5.1">subpoenaed with or without her because</text>
  <text start="209.52" dur="5.49">again if there&amp;#39;s a problem here and</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="4.83">things are not matching up he should be</text>
  <text start="215.01" dur="4.56">brought in actually Comey skipped out on</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="4.56">a hearing before Grassley&amp;#39;s committee</text>
  <text start="219.57" dur="3.54">this week following the June 14th</text>
  <text start="221.73" dur="5.55">release of the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="223.11" dur="8.07">inspector general&amp;#39;s report so he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="227.28" dur="5.19">even attend and we could see that he</text>
  <text start="231.18" dur="5.88">didn&amp;#39;t want to be a part of it because</text>
  <text start="232.47" dur="7.019">he knows he&amp;#39;s caught so when we look at</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="5.13">this whole situation we can see most of</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="5.101">these individuals they are in trouble</text>
  <text start="242.19" dur="3.87">and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out what</text>
  <text start="244.59" dur="4.47">they should do right now now Loretta</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="5.19">Lynch on the other hand was dinged in</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="5.04">the IG report over an ambiguous</text>
  <text start="251.25" dur="5.79">incomplete refusal from the Clinton</text>
  <text start="254.1" dur="5.94">email matter even though she was on the</text>
  <text start="257.04" dur="5.76">tarmac for 30 minutes with Bill Clinton</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="4.74">one week before the FBI exonerated</text>
  <text start="262.8" dur="5.31">Hillary Clinton we also learned that</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="8.13">there was really no investigation going</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="6.54">on with the Clinton email scandal so</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="3.06">there&amp;#39;s a lot going on right now and</text>
  <text start="274.65" dur="4.2">also there&amp;#39;s a lot that we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="275.97" dur="5.34">that was in the report but is not being</text>
  <text start="278.85" dur="5.67">shown to the public because once again q</text>
  <text start="281.31" dur="5.85">says this is rot Rosenstein version this</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="5.399">is not the unredacted unclassified</text>
  <text start="287.16" dur="5.28">report and that is something that needs</text>
  <text start="289.919" dur="6.121">to come out so America can say and I</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="6.06">think q said the time is now and I think</text>
  <text start="296.04" dur="4.05">this is the time when all of this does</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="3.41">should start to come out here because</text>
  <text start="300.09" dur="4.34">there&amp;#39;s no reason to wait any more</text>
  <text start="301.91" dur="7.319">now Facebook</text>
  <text start="304.43" dur="6.93">allowed a photo of a small girl that is</text>
  <text start="309.229" dur="5.041">crying and also disappeared untie</text>
  <text start="311.36" dur="4.29">magazine where it was Trump next to this</text>
  <text start="314.27" dur="4.89">crying little girl the same little girl</text>
  <text start="315.65" dur="6.239">and it says welcome to America and the</text>
  <text start="319.16" dur="5.03">post on Facebook was reunite an</text>
  <text start="321.889" dur="5.791">immigrant parent with their child</text>
  <text start="324.19" dur="7.75">fundraiser for racists by Charlotte</text>
  <text start="327.68" dur="8.7">Wilner and Dave Wilner and it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="331.94" dur="6.479">our AI CES and this is a charity that</text>
  <text start="336.38" dur="5.599">they started which is reunite and</text>
  <text start="338.419" dur="7.591">immigrant parent with their child and</text>
  <text start="341.979" dur="7.241">basically this photograph and the</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="7.439">caption under it is kind of false</text>
  <text start="349.22" dur="8.069">because the child and the mother they</text>
  <text start="353.449" dur="6.601">were never separated and were in fact in</text>
  <text start="357.289" dur="6.361">US custody and a family residential</text>
  <text start="360.05" dur="5.88">facility in Texas furthermore it emerged</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="4.889">that the mother had been previously</text>
  <text start="365.93" dur="5.19">deported in the US and according to her</text>
  <text start="368.539" dur="4.291">husband in Honduras she left him and</text>
  <text start="371.12" dur="4.229">three other children in early June</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="5.97">without informing him paying 6000 to a</text>
  <text start="375.349" dur="5.581">coyote smuggler to take her northwards</text>
  <text start="378.8" dur="5.339">so she could seek better economic</text>
  <text start="380.93" dur="6.049">opportunities now the photographed by</text>
  <text start="384.139" dur="5.131">John Moore of Getty Images it&amp;#39;s real and</text>
  <text start="386.979" dur="5.011">Getty only claimed that the mother and</text>
  <text start="389.27" dur="6">daughter had faced possible separation</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="5.799">however the story the media and</text>
  <text start="395.27" dur="6.06">activists had woven around the image is</text>
  <text start="397.789" dur="5.401">not accurate because they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="401.33" dur="3.36">separated but they were putting it out</text>
  <text start="403.19" dur="4.289">there that they were separated and they</text>
  <text start="404.69" dur="8.52">were using this to fundraise and they</text>
  <text start="407.479" dur="9.301">collected 17 point 7 million dollars</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="7.139">with a fake photo I mean this is just</text>
  <text start="416.78" dur="5.79">unbelievable and we saw yesterday where</text>
  <text start="420.349" dur="4.531">there was a little trial behind bars but</text>
  <text start="422.57" dur="5.01">that was during a protest and it was not</text>
  <text start="424.88" dur="4.529">a jail it was just for demonstration but</text>
  <text start="427.58" dur="4.44">again that was passed around making</text>
  <text start="429.409" dur="4.591">everyone believe that was real also we</text>
  <text start="432.02" dur="4.56">see that the Supreme Court ruled Friday</text>
  <text start="434" dur="4.2">that the law enforcement cannot track</text>
  <text start="436.58" dur="3.86">people movements for periods of</text>
  <text start="438.2" dur="5.37">weeks or months without a warrant and</text>
  <text start="440.44" dur="5.14">this was in a five to four ruling the</text>
  <text start="443.57" dur="3.69">court held that the acquisition of</text>
  <text start="445.58" dur="3.96">cell-site records by government</text>
  <text start="447.26" dur="4.59">officials is covered under the Fourth</text>
  <text start="449.54" dur="5.52">Amendment and of course it is it&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="451.85" dur="5.79">privacy once again it&amp;#39;s like sending a</text>
  <text start="455.06" dur="4.71">letter through the post office now the</text>
  <text start="457.64" dur="4.83">post office handles it they hold it then</text>
  <text start="459.77" dur="5.19">they deliver it the same thing with the</text>
  <text start="462.47" dur="6.09">carriers that hold your personal</text>
  <text start="464.96" dur="6">information and basically it&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="5.06">private information you&amp;#39;re entrusting</text>
  <text start="470.96" dur="5.37">them to hold your private information</text>
  <text start="473.62" dur="5.44">not to sell it not to give it away and</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="5.46">the authorities to see your private</text>
  <text start="479.06" dur="6.75">information they need to obtain a</text>
  <text start="481.79" dur="6.9">warrant under the Fourth Amendment and I</text>
  <text start="485.81" dur="5.85">it&amp;#39;s just amazing to me how everyone</text>
  <text start="488.69" dur="5.04">thinks that this is not how it should be</text>
  <text start="491.66" dur="4.77">but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s electronic</text>
  <text start="493.73" dur="6.24">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s on paper it</text>
  <text start="496.43" dur="6.09">doesn&amp;#39;t matter it&amp;#39;s your right to be</text>
  <text start="499.97" dur="3.66">private and if the government wants to</text>
  <text start="502.52" dur="3.78">see anything and they believe there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="503.63" dur="5.64">crime committed somehow someway they</text>
  <text start="506.3" dur="6.71">need to get a warrant and it looks like</text>
  <text start="509.27" dur="7.82">the Supreme Court upheld this now we see</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="7.36">Makran and Merkel they&amp;#39;re in trouble and</text>
  <text start="517.09" dur="5.5">these two leaders they&amp;#39;re facing an</text>
  <text start="520.37" dur="4.53">unexpected backlash from most other</text>
  <text start="522.59" dur="5.1">European governments against the German</text>
  <text start="524.9" dur="5.52">and French plans for a common euro zone</text>
  <text start="527.69" dur="6.45">budget and they were looking to place a</text>
  <text start="530.42" dur="5.19">tax and most of the other countries are</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="2.31">saying yeah we&amp;#39;re not doing this</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="3.81">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="536.45" dur="5.7">and what this was all about is that they</text>
  <text start="539.42" dur="5.87">agree that a new common pot of euro zone</text>
  <text start="542.15" dur="6.24">money could be funded by a mixture of</text>
  <text start="545.29" dur="6.27">national contributions and a new EU</text>
  <text start="548.39" dur="6.06">levies such as financial transaction tax</text>
  <text start="551.56" dur="4.54">the dutch prime minister said in the</text>
  <text start="554.45" dur="3.12">letter adding that there was also no</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="4.16">agreement to start exploring the use of</text>
  <text start="557.57" dur="5.85">financial transaction tax to finance it</text>
  <text start="560.26" dur="5.65">wrote a letter and the dutch finance</text>
  <text start="563.42" dur="5.16">minister on behalf of Belgium Luxemburg</text>
  <text start="565.91" dur="6.1">Austria Sweden Denmark Finland Latvia</text>
  <text start="568.58" dur="8.03">Lithuania Estonia Ireland and Malta</text>
  <text start="572.01" dur="8.32">they all said no way so simple math to</text>
  <text start="576.61" dur="5.88">verse 12 and it is safe to say that the</text>
  <text start="580.33" dur="4.65">rest of the eurozone is not aligned with</text>
  <text start="582.49" dur="5.22">France and Germany looks like Makran and</text>
  <text start="584.98" dur="5.4">Merkel they are in big trouble here I</text>
  <text start="587.71" dur="4.71">mean they&amp;#39;re going up against the</text>
  <text start="590.38" dur="4.59">European countries and nobody is</text>
  <text start="592.42" dur="5.43">agreeing with them whatsoever we see the</text>
  <text start="594.97" dur="5.67">North and South Korea they are preparing</text>
  <text start="597.85" dur="5.85">to reunite families divided by war and</text>
  <text start="600.64" dur="5.1">most of the population that was divided</text>
  <text start="603.7" dur="4.98">at a certain period of time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.74" dur="5.16">elderly now and the elderly people they</text>
  <text start="608.68" dur="5.22">are eager to reunite with their loved</text>
  <text start="610.9" dur="6.42">ones before you know they pass on and</text>
  <text start="613.9" dur="6.42">this is an incredible opportunity for</text>
  <text start="617.32" dur="4.86">families to come together once again we</text>
  <text start="620.32" dur="4.65">see that Trump has announced that North</text>
  <text start="622.18" dur="5.55">Korea has returned the remains of around</text>
  <text start="624.97" dur="5.58">200 US soldiers killed during the Korean</text>
  <text start="627.73" dur="6.09">War I believe they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="6.15">still about 7700 that weren&amp;#39;t accounted</text>
  <text start="633.82" dur="4.11">for and 200 were sent back to the u.s.</text>
  <text start="636.7" dur="3.09">now of course corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="637.93" dur="3.45">there saying there&amp;#39;s no proof of this</text>
  <text start="639.79" dur="4.14">there&amp;#39;s no proof of denuclearization</text>
  <text start="641.38" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s nothing we have no record of</text>
  <text start="643.93" dur="6.12">this whatsoever it&amp;#39;s not happening war</text>
  <text start="645.88" dur="7.71">is still imminent no they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="650.05" dur="7.41">pushing their agenda still we see out in</text>
  <text start="653.59" dur="5.76">Syria the Syrian army they have launched</text>
  <text start="657.46" dur="4.74">their long-awaited Southwest Syria</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="6.33">offensive and they are pushing down</text>
  <text start="662.2" dur="5.46">further and further south we see the US</text>
  <text start="665.68" dur="4.32">is saying that their military advisors</text>
  <text start="667.66" dur="4.38">came under attack and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="670" dur="4.74">attacked by unknown forces now I think</text>
  <text start="672.04" dur="5.82">this was a false flag where certain</text>
  <text start="674.74" dur="7.26">individuals were there and they attacked</text>
  <text start="677.86" dur="6.99">the base in LTF to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="682" dur="6.09">Syrian army was attacking and this would</text>
  <text start="684.85" dur="5.04">then push the US troops and the</text>
  <text start="688.09" dur="3.93">terrorist groups in the base and the</text>
  <text start="689.89" dur="5.1">moderate rebels to attack the Syrian</text>
  <text start="692.02" dur="6.66">army and this would push us into war and</text>
  <text start="694.99" dur="6.06">this incident just so happened when the</text>
  <text start="698.68" dur="6.06">Syrian army started to mount their</text>
  <text start="701.05" dur="6.45">offensive coincidence I think not</text>
  <text start="704.74" dur="5.58">we see the us-backed rebels they were</text>
  <text start="707.5" dur="5.22">behind the attack against the Syrian</text>
  <text start="710.32" dur="4.38">army now I know out in the news it was</text>
  <text start="712.72" dur="4.32">saying that the u.s. came out and they</text>
  <text start="714.7" dur="4.02">attacked this Syrian army it was not the</text>
  <text start="717.04" dur="4.71">US it wasn&amp;#39;t the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="718.72" dur="5.25">it was the us back rebels the the</text>

  <text start="734.11" dur="6.09">certain individuals like McCain and the</text>

  <text start="740.2" dur="6.6">attack the Syrian army hoping that a war</text>

  <text start="762.91" dur="5.39">are now defecting to the Syrian army and</text>
  <text start="766.44" dur="4.63">this is coming from the Russian</text>
  <text start="768.3" dur="5.2">reconciliation center that has reported</text>
  <text start="771.07" dur="4.769">this saying that the FSA is just giving</text>

  <text start="775.839" dur="5.071">of Syria once again we&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="778.51" dur="5.16">going to fight we see right now the</text>
  <text start="780.91" dur="5.19">Russian military expert Vladimir Kuzon</text>
  <text start="783.67" dur="4.59">has said that there is 19 terrorist</text>
  <text start="786.1" dur="4.62">training camps in Syria these are the</text>
  <text start="788.26" dur="5.07">bases that the deep state set up these</text>
  <text start="790.72" dur="5.73">are the training center of their paid</text>
  <text start="793.33" dur="6.3">mercenary army within the country of</text>
  <text start="796.45" dur="4.889">Syria now what is happening here is the</text>
  <text start="799.63" dur="2.67">deep state they&amp;#39;re trying to do whatever</text>
  <text start="801.339" dur="3.451">they possibly can</text>
  <text start="802.3" dur="4.65">to get a war started and it&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="804.79" dur="4.11">working and they&amp;#39;re having a very</text>
  <text start="806.95" dur="4.56">difficult time trying to push their</text>
  <text start="808.9" dur="6.48">agenda and I think they are dead in the</text>
  <text start="811.51" dur="6.36">water at this point we see Russia since</text>
  <text start="815.38" dur="5.1">they and Syria since they&amp;#39;ve moved into</text>
  <text start="817.87" dur="5.25">Duma and many of the other areas they</text>
  <text start="820.48" dur="5.609">are now finding chemical weapon</text>
  <text start="823.12" dur="4.11">production equipment and this is coming</text>
  <text start="826.089" dur="2.851">from Maria Zakharova</text>
  <text start="827.23" dur="4.65">where she&amp;#39;s saying that this equipment</text>
  <text start="828.94" dur="5.07">is professional you had to be trained on</text>
  <text start="831.88" dur="4.14">it and it was brought in from the</text>
  <text start="834.01" dur="3.57">western countries and this is what is</text>
  <text start="836.02" dur="4.08">happening right now as</text>
  <text start="837.58" dur="4.47">the paid mercenary army of the deep</text>
  <text start="840.1" dur="4.14">state is beaten and they&amp;#39;re being pushed</text>
  <text start="842.05" dur="3.87">out of these areas yes they tried to</text>
  <text start="844.24" dur="3.33">destroy as much as they possibly could</text>
  <text start="845.92" dur="3.3">of all their equipment and stuff but a</text>
  <text start="847.57" dur="4.32">lot of it&amp;#39;s being left behind and now</text>
  <text start="849.22" dur="4.89">these new discoveries are showing that</text>
  <text start="851.89" dur="4.53">they were creating these chemical</text>
  <text start="854.11" dur="4.02">weapons they were that they see the</text>
  <text start="856.42" dur="4.02">shells they see the equipment they see</text>
  <text start="858.13" dur="5.13">everything they&amp;#39;ve been using and this</text>
  <text start="860.44" dur="4.89">is what they have been doing all along</text>
  <text start="863.26" dur="5.06">they would launch a chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="865.33" dur="5.91">attack and they blame it on Assad and</text>
  <text start="868.32" dur="6.97">the US would pick it up the deep state</text>
  <text start="871.24" dur="5.58">nikki Haley or whoever would say yes it</text>
  <text start="875.29" dur="3.69">was Assad chemical weapons were used</text>
  <text start="876.82" dur="5">here&amp;#39;s the pictures of you know sick</text>
  <text start="878.98" dur="5.97">children&amp;#39;s sick people and they thought</text>
  <text start="881.82" dur="5.83">this would work and they would be able</text>
  <text start="884.95" dur="4.92">to go into Syria and remove Assad and</text>
  <text start="887.65" dur="4.74">they tried over and over and over and</text>
  <text start="889.87" dur="4.86">every time it didn&amp;#39;t work the way they</text>
  <text start="892.39" dur="4.59">thought now something very interesting</text>
  <text start="894.73" dur="6.59">happened and it reminds me of North</text>
  <text start="896.98" dur="7.71">Korea completely President Assad</text>
  <text start="901.32" dur="5.92">commented on the possibility of talks</text>
  <text start="904.69" dur="5.04">with the United States at the present</text>
  <text start="907.24" dur="5.88">moment in his interview to a news</text>
  <text start="909.73" dur="6.36">station saying that Washington&amp;#39;s policy</text>
  <text start="913.12" dur="5.34">was unlikely to change in the nearest</text>
  <text start="916.09" dur="5.64">future and thus establishing a dialogue</text>
  <text start="918.46" dur="5.91">would be a waste of time now we&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="921.73" dur="4.59">something not exactly the same but very</text>
  <text start="924.37" dur="4.35">similar with kim jeong-hoon</text>
  <text start="926.32" dur="3.99">where he said he was not going in the</text>
  <text start="928.72" dur="3.39">beginning he was not going to speak to</text>
  <text start="930.31" dur="3.99">United States there was no reason to</text>
  <text start="932.11" dur="5.91">speak to the United States and that was</text>
  <text start="934.3" dur="6.48">the beginning stages of saying yes I am</text>
  <text start="938.02" dur="5.57">open to a conversation because what</text>
  <text start="940.78" dur="6.03">Assad is saying right now is that</text>
  <text start="943.59" dur="5.56">Washington&amp;#39;s policies were unlikely to</text>
  <text start="946.81" dur="4.32">change well he knows they&amp;#39;ve changed</text>
  <text start="949.15" dur="5.1">because he saw what happened with Kim</text>
  <text start="951.13" dur="5.88">jong-eun where they didn&amp;#39;t go in and</text>
  <text start="954.25" dur="4.53">have regime change we didn&amp;#39;t bring in</text>
  <text start="957.01" dur="4.86">forces we didn&amp;#39;t bomb the hell out of</text>
  <text start="958.78" dur="5.31">the country there was a summit there</text>
  <text start="961.87" dur="3.72">were peace talks and if you look at</text>
  <text start="964.09" dur="3.33">North Korea they haven&amp;#39;t launched a</text>
  <text start="965.59" dur="4.35">missile they haven&amp;#39;t tested a nuclear</text>
  <text start="967.42" dur="3.63">device they&amp;#39;re destroying their nuclear</text>
  <text start="969.94" dur="3.06">weapons there</text>
  <text start="971.05" dur="5.55">turning the remains of soldiers that</text>
  <text start="973" dur="5.7">fought in the Korean War and we see</text>
  <text start="976.6" dur="3.72">right now that the south and north</text>
  <text start="978.7" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re coming together they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="980.32" dur="5.87">reuniting families so when we hear this</text>
  <text start="982.99" dur="6.33">from Assad this is the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="986.19" dur="6.54">letting Trump know and this is all part</text>
  <text start="989.32" dur="6.329">of the plan that talks are ready if</text>
  <text start="992.73" dur="6.97">Washington can change their policy and</text>
  <text start="995.649" dur="7.531">you know Washington can now so what</text>
  <text start="999.7" dur="8.04">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the plan the</text>
  <text start="1003.18" dur="6.42">plan to basically get the troops out of</text>
  <text start="1007.74" dur="4.289">Syria because I think what is going to</text>
  <text start="1009.6" dur="4.799">happen here and I think Putin I think</text>
  <text start="1012.029" dur="3.81">after the summit with Putin I think this</text>
  <text start="1014.399" dur="2.821">is when we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of things</text>
  <text start="1015.839" dur="4.281">change I think this is where we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1017.22" dur="5.97">to see peace talks once again just like</text>
  <text start="1020.12" dur="4.63">Trump meeting with Zhi Jing ping having</text>
  <text start="1023.19" dur="4.619">conversations with Putin on the phone</text>
  <text start="1024.75" dur="4.89">things change rapidly with North Korea I</text>
  <text start="1027.809" dur="5.161">think the same thing is going to happen</text>
  <text start="1029.64" dur="5.189">in Syria right now where Trump and Putin</text>
  <text start="1032.97" dur="3.9">are going to meet they&amp;#39;re going to meet</text>
  <text start="1034.829" dur="4.23">I think this July that&amp;#39;s when it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="1036.87" dur="5.28">planned for and I think right after that</text>
  <text start="1039.059" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;re going to see many things change in</text>
  <text start="1042.15" dur="7.14">Syria and I believe we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="1044.819" dur="6.661">meeting with Assad and Trump and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1049.29" dur="5.16">going to be talking about everything</text>
  <text start="1051.48" dur="5.39">about Syria and removing the troops and</text>
  <text start="1054.45" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re gonna come to an agreement and</text>
  <text start="1056.87" dur="3.88">we&amp;#39;re going to see this happen and</text>
  <text start="1059.07" dur="5.01">unfold right in front of her eyes</text>
  <text start="1060.75" dur="6.96">because things are changing right now it</text>
  <text start="1064.08" dur="5.76">is time and the deep state is beaten at</text>
  <text start="1067.71" dur="4.98">this point there&amp;#39;s nothing left for them</text>
  <text start="1069.84" dur="6.62">in Syria so we&amp;#39;ve already seen Iran</text>
  <text start="1072.69" dur="6.36">mulling the idea of withdrawing troops</text>
  <text start="1076.46" dur="4.45">we know that Putin put that message out</text>
  <text start="1079.05" dur="3.66">there and if you look each time they put</text>
  <text start="1080.91" dur="3.87">a little message out there to get</text>
  <text start="1082.71" dur="4.5">everyone used to the idea to get</text>
  <text start="1084.78" dur="3.99">everyone thinking about it there to get</text>
  <text start="1087.21" dur="4.5">everyone moving in a certain direction</text>
  <text start="1088.77" dur="4.5">and we see right now with Assad coming</text>
  <text start="1091.71" dur="2.969">out saying this and I&amp;#39;ve never heard him</text>
  <text start="1093.27" dur="4.11">say this in the past</text>
  <text start="1094.679" dur="5.911">maybe mentioned it but you can see this</text>
  <text start="1097.38" dur="5.789">is a definite signal just like we had in</text>
  <text start="1100.59" dur="4.319">North Korea this is the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="1103.169" dur="3.72">and I believe right after the summer</text>
