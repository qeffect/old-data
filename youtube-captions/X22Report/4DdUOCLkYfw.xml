  <text start="83.509" dur="5.191">it&amp;#39;s bobbing up and down in that range</text>
  <text start="86.479" dur="3.871">nothing has improved in Greece</text>
  <text start="88.7" dur="3.99">whatsoever they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="90.35" dur="7.1">implementing austerity they&amp;#39;re selling</text>
  <text start="92.69" dur="8.7">off their assets why to get more debt</text>
  <text start="97.45" dur="8.5">haven&amp;#39;t they realized at this time that</text>
  <text start="101.39" dur="6.929">as they take on more debt the situation</text>
  <text start="105.95" dur="5.369">just gets worse and worse and worse it</text>
  <text start="108.319" dur="5.61">doesn&amp;#39;t improve whatsoever I mean the</text>
  <text start="111.319" dur="4.83">people voted saying that we don&amp;#39;t want</text>

  <text start="116.149" dur="4.23">getting them well the European finance</text>
  <text start="118.399" dur="5.25">ministers they&amp;#39;ve reached an agreement</text>
  <text start="120.379" dur="6.72">to bail out Greece once again yes they</text>
  <text start="123.649" dur="6.661">are getting another round of 8.5 billion</text>
  <text start="127.099" dur="6.301">euros and again they&amp;#39;re going to discuss</text>
  <text start="130.31" dur="5.63">a debt extension now there was a payment</text>
  <text start="133.4" dur="5.699">that was coming up they kind of</text>
  <text start="135.94" dur="7.12">basically went around it with another</text>
  <text start="139.099" dur="5.161">tranche of more debt and they&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="143.06" dur="3.47">same situation</text>
  <text start="144.26" dur="4.68">there has been no improvement whatsoever</text>
  <text start="146.53" dur="3.91">yes they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating a lot of</text>
  <text start="148.94" dur="3.93">the numbers to make it look like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="150.44" dur="4.95">improving but think about it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="152.87" dur="5.25">selling their ports their railroads</text>
  <text start="155.39" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re selling their airports the</text>
  <text start="158.12" dur="4.77">pension they push this out many many</text>
  <text start="161.15" dur="4.97">years where they&amp;#39;re cutting pensions</text>
  <text start="162.89" dur="5.22">more and more people are being let go</text>
  <text start="166.12" dur="4.6">austerities being implemented on the</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="5.43">people yes they can manipulate the</text>
  <text start="170.72" dur="3.87">statistics but the hard facts is it is</text>
  <text start="173.54" dur="5.16">not getting better</text>
  <text start="174.59" dur="6.36">whatsoever out in the UK we can see no</text>
  <text start="178.7" dur="4.47">matter what the central bank is trying</text>
  <text start="180.95" dur="5.31">to do the people are still saying listen</text>
  <text start="183.17" dur="4.26">if we want the brexit more than 70</text>
  <text start="186.26" dur="3">percent of Britain</text>
  <text start="187.43" dur="4.56">still believe the government should push</text>
  <text start="189.26" dur="6.21">ahead with the brexit they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="191.99" dur="5.37">they want it done and we can see that</text>
  <text start="195.47" dur="2.37">the first round of talks is going to</text>
  <text start="197.36" dur="3.06">happen</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="5.13">June 19th and think about all the things</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="4.11">that have happened prior to this because</text>
  <text start="202.97" dur="4.08">they knew the talks were coming up</text>
  <text start="204.53" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re trying to derail this any way</text>
  <text start="207.05" dur="5.82">they possibly can with false Flags with</text>
  <text start="209.87" dur="5.37">events they don&amp;#39;t care as long as they</text>
  <text start="212.87" dur="4.89">try to derail this postpone this they</text>
  <text start="215.24" dur="6.54">want to stop this but it looks like this</text>
  <text start="217.76" dur="6.66">is being pushed forward out in Canada we</text>
  <text start="221.78" dur="4.44">see the housing market well things are</text>
  <text start="224.42" dur="3.69">not going well whatsoever we see</text>
  <text start="226.22" dur="4.86">Canada&amp;#39;s existing home sales they</text>
  <text start="228.11" dur="6.06">crashed by 6.2 percent and this is</text>
  <text start="231.08" dur="7.17">pretty darn bad because this is a huge</text>
  <text start="234.17" dur="6.66">drop in existing home sales and it looks</text>
  <text start="238.25" dur="4.89">like the bubble well it could be popping</text>
  <text start="240.83" dur="4.47">right now because as we can see in many</text>
  <text start="243.14" dur="5.19">areas of the country many areas around</text>
  <text start="245.3" dur="7.56">the world the housing Bumble has been</text>
  <text start="248.33" dur="6.93">pumped up to extremes and as we know</text>
  <text start="252.86" dur="5.129">when these bubbles pop everything is</text>
  <text start="255.26" dur="5.4">going to come down because everything is</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="4.801">attached the mortgage the bet the</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="4.86">mortgage department&amp;#39;s the banks the loan</text>
  <text start="262.79" dur="5.58">centers the the lumber yards the</text>
  <text start="265.52" dur="6.18">concrete the steel the plumbers the</text>
  <text start="268.37" dur="5.85">electricians it&amp;#39;s all connected and when</text>
  <text start="271.7" dur="6.84">real estate comes down it is going to be</text>
  <text start="274.22" dur="9.15">a complete disaster now today we saw</text>
  <text start="278.54" dur="8.129">Bitcoin and it dropped quite a bit today</text>
  <text start="283.37" dur="6.27">and it rallied over about 80 percent</text>
  <text start="286.669" dur="6.361">last month and it just came down about</text>
  <text start="289.64" dur="6.54">25 percent now what happened was there</text>
  <text start="293.03" dur="6.24">was a supposed cyber attack on the</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="6.03">exchanges and they were getting hit by a</text>
  <text start="299.27" dur="5.28">DDoS and services were down they were</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="5.43">slow and also people are very worried</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="5.07">about the bill that was introduced where</text>
  <text start="307.64" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re gonna be going after Bitcoin or</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="4.32">any type of cryptocurrency when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.54" dur="5.67">leaving the country entering the country</text>
  <text start="313.94" dur="4.349">and we can see that people were you know</text>
  <text start="317.21" dur="3.69">something maybe I should get out of</text>
  <text start="318.289" dur="4.591">Bitcoin but we could see at this point</text>
  <text start="320.9" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s starting to move up once again now</text>
  <text start="322.88" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;m not saying that Bitcoin or Kryptos</text>
  <text start="325.13" dur="4.65">are better than gold and silver gold and</text>
  <text start="327.62" dur="4.88">silver well they are physical you can</text>
  <text start="329.78" dur="5.43">hold them they retain value right now</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="4.66">crypto currencies the way I see them</text>
  <text start="335.21" dur="4.35">this is in the beginning of like say the</text>
  <text start="337.16" dur="5.16">dot-com phase where you saw a lot of</text>
  <text start="339.56" dur="6.57">dot-com companies now we have about 750</text>
  <text start="342.32" dur="5.34">crypto currencies out there today this</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="3.69">is the beginning stages now a lot of</text>
  <text start="347.66" dur="4.82">them gonna completely disappear there</text>
  <text start="349.82" dur="6.66">will be a few that are left over and</text>
  <text start="352.48" dur="6.54">they will thrive and some countries</text>
  <text start="356.48" dur="6.36">maybe even this country when everything</text>
  <text start="359.02" dur="6.34">implodes we might maybe move to Kryptos</text>
  <text start="362.84" dur="4.65">maybe Kryptos backed by silver or</text>
  <text start="365.36" dur="4.25">something in that range but we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="5.34">know exactly what is going to be but</text>
  <text start="369.61" dur="5.89">what&amp;#39;s important about this is that you</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="4.83">can use this to your advantage because</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="5.43">you can watch it and as it dips really</text>
  <text start="377.66" dur="5.55">really low you can buy into it and you</text>
  <text start="380.93" dur="3.99">can watch it go up and sell off of it</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="4.32">and it&amp;#39;s very easy to do you can use</text>
  <text start="384.92" dur="5.76">coin base you can use bit tricks you can</text>
  <text start="387.53" dur="5.85">use politics you can use any of these</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="4.71">which allows you to get into the market</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="4.5">and I&amp;#39;m going to do a little tutorial</text>
  <text start="395.39" dur="4.47">video on this because a lot of people</text>
  <text start="397.88" dur="4.26">are writing in asking oh yeah I see</text>
  <text start="399.86" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s out there how do I get into it so</text>
  <text start="402.14" dur="6.45">look for that I&amp;#39;m gonna be putting that</text>
  <text start="404.45" dur="5.58">up on the news flash YouTube channel and</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="3.39">this way people can see I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="4.68">show you actually how to sign up how to</text>
  <text start="411.98" dur="7.41">use them and we&amp;#39;ll go from there</text>
  <text start="414.71" dur="7.7">now Nike they are cutting around 2% of</text>
  <text start="419.39" dur="5.85">their global workforce and that&amp;#39;s around</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="4.15">1,500 employees and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="4.59">right now is these large corporations</text>
  <text start="426.56" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re laying off a lot of people and</text>
  <text start="429.83" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s continuing I mean we see Toys R Us</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="4.35">their sales are down and we see many</text>
  <text start="434.84" dur="4.08">many corporations out there where</text>
  <text start="436.82" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re just saying listen we need to</text>
  <text start="438.92" dur="3.9">start laying off but they&amp;#39;re keeping it</text>
  <text start="440.27" dur="4.8">very very quiet and I remember prior to</text>
  <text start="442.82" dur="4.71">the stock market coming down in 2008</text>
  <text start="445.07" dur="4.77">there were a lot of companies laying off</text>
  <text start="447.53" dur="3.9">during this period right before the</text>
  <text start="449.84" dur="3.06">stock market came down and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="451.43" dur="2.459">starting to see the same thing once</text>
  <text start="452.9" dur="3.539">again because</text>
  <text start="453.889" dur="4.62">think about it if the economy has been</text>
  <text start="456.439" dur="4.38">recovering and the stock market</text>
  <text start="458.509" dur="3.66">continually rises and everything is</text>
  <text start="460.819" dur="3.69">fantastic like they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="462.169" dur="4.441">convince us of why are companies laying</text>
  <text start="464.509" dur="3.421">off I mean if the stock marks going up</text>
  <text start="466.61" dur="4.079">doesn&amp;#39;t that mean that the companies are</text>
  <text start="467.93" dur="4.25">doing well but what do we see we</text>
  <text start="470.689" dur="3.66">actually see the opposite happening</text>
  <text start="472.18" dur="4.57">stores are closing left and right</text>
  <text start="474.349" dur="4.051">corporations are laying off people are</text>
  <text start="476.75" dur="4.08">looking for work they can&amp;#39;t find work</text>
  <text start="478.4" dur="5.039">because what we&amp;#39;re realizing right now</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="5.429">is that the economy is imploding on</text>
  <text start="483.439" dur="6.09">itself and it&amp;#39;s getting worse as time</text>
  <text start="486.259" dur="5.011">goes on this is why the Fed decided to</text>
  <text start="489.529" dur="4.591">raise the interest rates once again</text>
  <text start="491.27" dur="5.16">because they realized okay the economy</text>
  <text start="494.12" dur="4.71">is accelerating to the downside let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.43" dur="4.229">push this ahead we need to bring it down</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="3.42">we need to control the narrative and</text>
  <text start="500.659" dur="3.201">this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing if we</text>
  <text start="502.25" dur="4.68">look at manufacturing right now</text>
  <text start="503.86" dur="5.709">manufacturing output it dropped by 0.4</text>
  <text start="506.93" dur="5.039">percent month on month in May and we see</text>
  <text start="509.569" dur="6.121">industrial production well it looks like</text>
  <text start="511.969" dur="6.51">it&amp;#39;s stalled it barely moved above zero</text>
  <text start="515.69" dur="4.94">now we did have this little bounce when</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="4.68">Trump was elected but it seems like</text>
  <text start="520.63" dur="5.17">everything is starting to fall apart now</text>
  <text start="523.159" dur="6.12">and if we really look at this the Dow</text>
  <text start="525.8" dur="7.409">Jones Industrial Average it is up by 30</text>
  <text start="529.279" dur="7.981">percent but the US industrial production</text>
  <text start="533.209" dur="7.861">it is down two percent from its peak in</text>
  <text start="537.26" dur="6.019">November of 2014 they actually separated</text>
  <text start="541.07" dur="5.97">and they&amp;#39;re going in opposite directions</text>
  <text start="543.279" dur="6.131">now so you can tell something is being</text>
  <text start="547.04" dur="5.88">manipulated here and we know what it is</text>
  <text start="549.41" dur="5.91">it is called the stock market now since</text>
  <text start="552.92" dur="6.75">we&amp;#39;re in this great recovery and the</text>
  <text start="555.32" dur="5.97">economy&amp;#39;s doing so well which the Fed is</text>
  <text start="559.67" dur="3.3">telling us that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="561.29" dur="3.39">well because they said Oh unemployment</text>
  <text start="562.97" dur="4.41">looks good retail looks good</text>
  <text start="564.68" dur="3.719">inflation is holding and everything</text>
  <text start="567.38" dur="2.76">looks great and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="568.399" dur="5.581">raising the interest rates why is</text>
  <text start="570.14" dur="4.759">Illinois why are they in tough shape</text>
  <text start="573.98" dur="5.82">actually</text>
  <text start="574.899" dur="7.75">Illinois&amp;#39;s economic growth is worse than</text>
  <text start="579.8" dur="5.519">during the Great Depression I mean think</text>
  <text start="582.649" dur="5.071">about that for a second now a lot of the</text>
  <text start="585.319" dur="5.7">manufacturing well they left this</text>
  <text start="587.72" dur="5.52">area and it&amp;#39;s a very they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="591.019" dur="3.99">very difficult time but when we look at</text>
  <text start="593.24" dur="3.599">it we can see that Illinois&amp;#39;s total</text>
  <text start="595.009" dur="6.33">state economic activity has increased</text>
  <text start="596.839" dur="7.321">only four percent since 2007 which is</text>
  <text start="601.339" dur="4.86">lower than the u.s. ten percent GDP</text>
  <text start="604.16" dur="5.729">growth during the worst decade of the</text>
  <text start="606.199" dur="6.75">Great Depression there are fewer people</text>
  <text start="609.889" dur="6.361">living in Illinois working today than</text>
  <text start="612.949" dur="7.591">there were ten years ago millions of</text>
  <text start="616.25" dur="6.389">people are leaving and basically what</text>
  <text start="620.54" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a lot of</text>
  <text start="622.639" dur="3.661">people are saying you know something I</text>
  <text start="624.17" dur="4.8">can&amp;#39;t stay here there&amp;#39;s no jobs there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="626.3" dur="6.12">nothing here so what is happening there</text>
  <text start="628.97" dur="6.9">is people are leaving and Illinois</text>
  <text start="632.42" dur="6.959">now loses on that one person every four</text>
  <text start="635.87" dur="7.17">point six minutes to other states this</text>
  <text start="639.379" dur="6.541">is how bad it is and we can see that</text>
  <text start="643.04" dur="5.729">they are worse off than the Great</text>
  <text start="645.92" dur="5.729">Depression so this tells us something</text>
  <text start="648.769" dur="4.711">this tells us that nothing&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="651.649" dur="6.031">improving here and if we look at other</text>
  <text start="653.48" dur="7.26">states they&amp;#39;re right behind it and when</text>
  <text start="657.68" dur="6.029">this system comes down it is going to be</text>
  <text start="660.74" dur="5.49">a shock to the majority of people in</text>
  <text start="663.709" dur="4.771">this country and actually around the</text>
  <text start="666.23" dur="4.74">world because a lot of people have been</text>
  <text start="668.48" dur="5.52">sucked into this illusion where</text>
  <text start="670.97" dur="5.46">everything is fine and everything&amp;#39;s ok</text>
  <text start="674" dur="5.61">the economy&amp;#39;s doing well the stock</text>
  <text start="676.43" dur="6.899">market&amp;#39;s going up and we can see that</text>
  <text start="679.61" dur="7.26">this is just one big lie and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="683.329" dur="6.291">been lying for a very long time actually</text>
  <text start="686.87" dur="5.85">according to Bloomberg&amp;#39;s mark could more</text>
  <text start="689.62" dur="6.699">he said the Fed has just brought the</text>
  <text start="692.72" dur="5.969">next recession that much closer actually</text>
  <text start="696.319" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re already in a recession what he</text>
  <text start="698.689" dur="6">should have said is the Fed has brought</text>
  <text start="700.699" dur="6.81">the collapse that much closer and he</text>
  <text start="704.689" dur="6.241">said that every time the Fed tightens it</text>
  <text start="707.509" dur="6.3">always ends with a recession the only</text>
  <text start="710.93" dur="3.87">question is when and we can see and we</text>
  <text start="713.809" dur="3.15">went over this yesterday</text>
  <text start="714.8" dur="6.09">every time they raised the rates like</text>
  <text start="716.959" dur="7.951">this every time they try to maneuver and</text>
  <text start="720.89" dur="6.96">the economy we end up in a recession a</text>
  <text start="724.91" dur="3.99">depression this time we&amp;#39;re gonna end in</text>
  <text start="727.85" dur="3.66">a collapse</text>
  <text start="728.9" dur="5.49">now we were discussing in other reports</text>
  <text start="731.51" dur="5.61">how important it is for trade because as</text>
  <text start="734.39" dur="5.55">we know once the dollar ceases to be the</text>
  <text start="737.12" dur="4.86">reserve currency of the world well the</text>

  <text start="745.34" dur="5.58">will not give us goods we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="747.62" dur="4.5">going to have to trade with them and we</text>
  <text start="750.92" dur="4.11">can see there are other countries that</text>
  <text start="752.12" dur="5.64">are starting to realize yeah the United</text>
  <text start="755.03" dur="5.79">States is done for we need to look in</text>
  <text start="757.76" dur="6.84">other areas for trade actually Japanese</text>

  <text start="764.6" dur="6">looking to join the one belt one Road</text>
  <text start="767.54" dur="5.67">initiative and basically what is</text>
  <text start="770.6" dur="5.04">happening right now he is looking to</text>
  <text start="773.21" dur="4.44">join up now he has certain conditions</text>
  <text start="775.64" dur="3.39">that he once met and these are the</text>
  <text start="777.65" dur="5.82">conditions that were in the</text>
  <text start="779.03" dur="9.32">trans-pacific economic zone and what he</text>
  <text start="783.47" dur="9.03">wants is a harmony with a free and fair</text>

  <text start="792.5" dur="5.73">in reference to the TTIP and we see</text>
  <text start="795.86" dur="6.27">right now that the Chinese Foreign</text>

  <text start="807.77" dur="4.62">Japan to achieve mutually beneficial</text>
  <text start="809.42" dur="6.18">cooperation and common development so</text>
  <text start="812.39" dur="6.75">countries are starting to realize that</text>
  <text start="815.6" dur="5.7">the u.s. dominance is over they need to</text>
  <text start="819.14" dur="4.38">look other places they need to look</text>
  <text start="821.3" dur="4.95">other places for trade and this is</text>
  <text start="823.52" dur="3.96">exactly what is happening and most</text>
  <text start="826.25" dur="4.77">likely we&amp;#39;re going to see other</text>
  <text start="827.48" dur="6.6">countries start to join the bail-in Road</text>
  <text start="831.02" dur="5.85">initiative because they realize that</text>
  <text start="834.08" dur="5.25">they need to look other places because</text>
  <text start="836.87" dur="5.4">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is this</text>

  <text start="915.57" dur="5.76">hike they realize this and I said this</text>
  <text start="918.81" dur="6">before they&amp;#39;re going to do this in two</text>
  <text start="921.33" dur="5.31">stages where the first stage is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.81" dur="4.86">going to most likely blame this on Trump</text>
  <text start="926.64" dur="6.21">they will say this is what happened we</text>
  <text start="929.67" dur="5.28">were raising the rates and he threw his</text>
  <text start="932.85" dur="3.9">economic policies didn&amp;#39;t allow the</text>
  <text start="934.95" dur="4.01">economy to grow the way we wanted to</text>
  <text start="936.75" dur="4.17">grow and now we have to start up</text>

  <text start="942.45" dur="3.87">lowering the rates once again we might</text>
  <text start="944.67" dur="4.55">even have to go negative and we might</text>
  <text start="946.32" dur="6.81">have to start the universal basic income</text>

  <text start="953.13" dur="6.63">up the economy once again we will most</text>
  <text start="957.33" dur="5.61">likely get hit with some type of cyber</text>
  <text start="959.76" dur="5.64">attack this is the start of their plan</text>
  <text start="962.94" dur="3.68">this is what they want to do does it</text>
  <text start="965.4" dur="3.78">mean they&amp;#39;re gonna be able to do it</text>
  <text start="966.62" dur="4.06">maybe maybe not because we have</text>
  <text start="969.18" dur="4.8">trumpeting of the start on the other</text>
  <text start="970.68" dur="5.16">side and he is continually fighting to</text>
  <text start="973.98" dur="4.29">try to take control of the narrative we</text>
