  <text start="27.91" dur="5.199">I&amp;#39;m welcome to the x20 to report my name</text>
  <text start="30.71" dur="6.3">is dave and this is episode 185 and</text>
  <text start="33.109" dur="6.45">today&amp;#39;s date is October 10th 2013 and</text>
  <text start="37.01" dur="4.889">the title of this episode is will the</text>
  <text start="39.559" dur="5.07">government sabotage the trucker&amp;#39;s ride</text>
  <text start="41.899" dur="4.471">for the Constitution and we all</text>
  <text start="44.629" dur="4.59">understand that the trucker&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="46.37" dur="5.629">heading down to DC and they&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="49.219" dur="5.73">to be about ten thousand trucks or so</text>
  <text start="51.999" dur="7.18">which are going to be surrounding</text>
  <text start="54.949" dur="7.91">Washington and what has happened now the</text>
  <text start="59.179" dur="7.62">bikers decided to join them down in DC</text>
  <text start="62.859" dur="7.001">the veterans decided to join the bikers</text>
  <text start="66.799" dur="5.521">and the truckers and everyday people who</text>
  <text start="69.86" dur="6.03">are protesting the closing of a national</text>
  <text start="72.32" dur="6.81">monuments memorials national parks are</text>
  <text start="75.89" dur="6.24">also heading down to Washington DC and</text>
  <text start="79.13" dur="6.87">we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of people</text>
  <text start="82.13" dur="6.54">protesting and really this is a huge</text>
  <text start="86" dur="6.03">potential false flag because all the</text>
  <text start="88.67" dur="6.3">government has to do is mix another</text>
  <text start="92.03" dur="6">truck into the mix which wouldn&amp;#39;t be a</text>
  <text start="94.97" dur="5.19">trucker which would be an agent and they</text>
  <text start="98.03" dur="4.62">could have a bomb they could do</text>
  <text start="100.16" dur="5.07">something with the veterans they can mix</text>
  <text start="102.65" dur="5.4">a couple of people up who have weapons</text>
  <text start="105.23" dur="5.28">and start shooting and this could get</text>
  <text start="108.05" dur="5.34">out of control and this is a perfect</text>
  <text start="110.51" dur="7.83">opportunity for the government to do</text>
  <text start="113.39" dur="8.49">something and and this is why the title</text>
  <text start="118.34" dur="5.31">is about sabotage because this is</text>
  <text start="121.88" dur="4.32">starting tomorrow the trucker&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="123.65" dur="4.8">going to be arriving in DC and all</text>

  <text start="176.33" dur="4.83">it just adds the problem on top of</text>
  <text start="179.6" dur="4.83">another problem on top of another</text>
  <text start="181.16" dur="6.09">problem and this is not a solution this</text>
  <text start="184.43" dur="4.86">is a temporary oh let&amp;#39;s push this to the</text>
  <text start="187.25" dur="4.23">to the side and no one will complain</text>
  <text start="189.29" dur="4.2">about it and we&amp;#39;ll deal with it when it</text>
  <text start="191.48" dur="4.2">comes up again and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="193.49" dur="4.53">happening out in Europe in Greece and</text>
  <text start="195.68" dur="4.29">Cyprus portugal spain france and the</text>
  <text start="198.02" dur="4.939">same things happening here in the united</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="5.58">states nothing has been fixed here</text>
  <text start="202.959" dur="6.551">things are just actually getting worse</text>
  <text start="205.55" dur="7.55">the debt continually to rise and this is</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="7.68">not going to end well and Rasmussen has</text>
  <text start="213.1" dur="6.85">done a poll and eighty-three percent of</text>
  <text start="217.19" dur="4.829">americans say that we are heading in the</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="3.569">wrong direction and let me tell you I</text>
  <text start="222.019" dur="4.411">feel like we&amp;#39;re heading in the wrong</text>
  <text start="223.519" dur="6.661">direction because we are this is not the</text>
  <text start="226.43" dur="6.15">direction we need to be headed in now we</text>
  <text start="230.18" dur="5.19">understand President Obama came into</text>
  <text start="232.58" dur="4.71">office in 2008 the national debt was</text>
  <text start="235.37" dur="5.01">around ten point six trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="237.29" dur="6.54">and right now the national debt is</text>
  <text start="240.38" dur="6.329">approaching 17 trillion so from the time</text>
  <text start="243.83" dur="6.11">he took office to now approximately it</text>
  <text start="246.709" dur="7.461">went up approximately seven trillion</text>
  <text start="249.94" dur="7.03">dollars by the end if we keep the the</text>
  <text start="254.17" dur="6.069">the average of one point two eight</text>
  <text start="256.97" dur="5.79">trillion each year by the time he leaves</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="4.68">office the national debt will be at</text>
  <text start="262.76" dur="4.17">twenty trillion and that&amp;#39;s the stuff</text>
  <text start="264.919" dur="3.841">that&amp;#39;s the debt that they&amp;#39;re reporting</text>
  <text start="266.93" dur="3.84">to us but there are other reports saying</text>
  <text start="268.76" dur="3.78">that the actual National that is around</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="4.38">200 trillion</text>
  <text start="272.54" dur="5.19">dollars when you add everything in but</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="5.07">if we just use the numbers of 10.6 when</text>
  <text start="277.73" dur="7.65">he came into office 20 trillion when he</text>
  <text start="280.22" dur="8.97">leaves office this is so much debt there</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="7.17">is so much interest on this debt if the</text>
  <text start="289.19" dur="5.31">interest if the rates rise the</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="3.72">government would not be able to make</text>
  <text start="294.5" dur="3.9">these payments right now and they would</text>
  <text start="296.27" dur="4.91">end up borrowing more to make those</text>
  <text start="298.4" dur="5.88">payments and the debt would triple</text>
  <text start="301.18" dur="4.6">quadruple until we it cannot be</text>
  <text start="304.28" dur="6.3">sustained and we&amp;#39;re seeing this right</text>
  <text start="305.78" dur="7.95">now and them discussing the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="310.58" dur="5.07">and raising it it doesn&amp;#39;t matter I saw</text>
  <text start="313.73" dur="4.41">today they&amp;#39;re out there saying that if</text>
  <text start="315.65" dur="5.55">we raise it temporarily for the next six</text>
  <text start="318.14" dur="4.98">weeks we&amp;#39;ll revisit it the same things</text>
  <text start="321.2" dur="6.3">going to happen there is no difference</text>
  <text start="323.12" dur="7.44">and Senator Tom Coburn said we are 30</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="5.85">trillion in the hole plus another 17</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="6.27">trillion in debt wouldn&amp;#39;t it be smart if</text>
  <text start="333.35" dur="5.37">we started addressing the problem before</text>
  <text start="336.83" dur="3.81">we blankly allow an increase in the</text>
  <text start="338.72" dur="4.56">level of the credit card and I</text>
  <text start="340.64" dur="4.86">completely agree no one is discussing</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="4.41">the problem because they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="345.5" dur="5.52">solution and the solution would hurt and</text>
  <text start="347.69" dur="5.76">that is called a major major collapse at</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="4.5">this point and nobody wants to pull the</text>
  <text start="353.45" dur="4.5">trigger on that they&amp;#39;d rather have this</text>
  <text start="355.52" dur="5.37">be blamed on someone else or another</text>
  <text start="357.95" dur="4.98">country where the blame is not on the</text>
  <text start="360.89" dur="4.5">Republicans it is not on the Democrats</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="4.65">it is not on the president it&amp;#39;s not on</text>
  <text start="365.39" dur="5.1">the Fed and this is what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="367.58" dur="5.79">to end up doing they are going to shift</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="6.48">the blame somewhere else because no one</text>
  <text start="373.37" dur="6.06">is man enough to suck it up and say we</text>
  <text start="376.97" dur="5.37">have a major problem we have to change</text>
  <text start="379.43" dur="6.09">this president and all other presidents</text>
  <text start="382.34" dur="6.03">none of them were man enough to stand up</text>
  <text start="385.52" dur="8.19">to the feds central bankers and say</text>
  <text start="388.37" dur="6.87">enough is enough now Jack Lew the</text>
  <text start="393.71" dur="4.32">Treasury secretary is out there saying</text>
  <text start="395.24" dur="9.57">that you know that social security</text>
  <text start="398.03" dur="8.37">payments are are at risk and you know if</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="3.57">we hit the debt ceiling people are not</text>
  <text start="406.4" dur="4.44">get their social security payments well</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="5.61">I hate to say this social security is a</text>
  <text start="410.84" dur="8.1">trust every single person pays into this</text>
  <text start="413.99" dur="7.679">and the money is supposedly invested for</text>
  <text start="418.94" dur="5.16">the people that are going to retire and</text>
  <text start="421.669" dur="5.641">then this money is then paid out to them</text>
  <text start="424.1" dur="6.39">but what has happened is the during the</text>
  <text start="427.31" dur="5.81">Clinton administration they took the</text>
  <text start="430.49" dur="5.94">Social Security money and that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="433.12" dur="5.38">they were saying that you know we were</text>
  <text start="436.43" dur="5.4">in the black now and everything seems</text>
  <text start="438.5" dur="6.57">good they took the money and they</text>
  <text start="441.83" dur="5.369">replaced it with Treasury bonds and they</text>
  <text start="445.07" dur="4.469">started giving everyone refunds from the</text>
  <text start="447.199" dur="4.53">Social Security Fund and this is what</text>
  <text start="449.539" dur="4.111">the jackal who is saying right now is</text>
  <text start="451.729" dur="5.22">that there&amp;#39;s no money in Social Security</text>
  <text start="453.65" dur="6.12">at all and if we can&amp;#39;t borrow to hand</text>
  <text start="456.949" dur="5.581">this out anymore and people will not get</text>
  <text start="459.77" dur="6.149">their payments but we and we trusted the</text>
  <text start="462.53" dur="6.479">government to handle the money keep it</text>
  <text start="465.919" dur="5.341">in a trust fund for everyone and guess</text>
  <text start="469.009" dur="4.771">what they did they robbed social</text>
  <text start="471.26" dur="4.469">security they are robbing the pensions</text>
  <text start="473.78" dur="6.15">right now to keep the government open</text>
  <text start="475.729" dur="6.391">and they are not to be trusted with any</text>
  <text start="479.93" dur="8.37">of the people&amp;#39;s money at this point they</text>
  <text start="482.12" dur="11.88">cannot handle this okay now in my other</text>
  <text start="488.3" dur="9.51">reports I&amp;#39;ve reported on a the job the</text>
  <text start="494" dur="5.97">unemployment the jobless claims and I</text>
  <text start="497.81" dur="5.94">understand we I discussed that it was</text>
  <text start="499.97" dur="7.08">all manipulated and people I mean back</text>
  <text start="503.75" dur="6.09">in 1994 they manipulated the calculation</text>
  <text start="507.05" dur="5.489">so every time we see the unemployment</text>
  <text start="509.84" dur="4.02">drop it&amp;#39;s basically their noun ting</text>
  <text start="512.539" dur="3.541">those people who are no longer look</text>
  <text start="513.86" dur="4.559">looking for work they keep massaging the</text>
  <text start="516.08" dur="4.829">data manipulating the numbers to make it</text>
  <text start="518.419" dur="4.86">look good because their plan at the time</text>
  <text start="520.909" dur="3.511">was to show the economy was getting</text>
  <text start="523.279" dur="4.171">better and we saw this going through the</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="4.53">summer we saw obama out there and he was</text>
  <text start="527.45" dur="3.42">telling us that the housing was</text>
  <text start="528.95" dur="4.59">recovering we saw the unemployment</text>
  <text start="530.87" dur="5.909">coming down they were saying that retail</text>
  <text start="533.54" dur="5.85">was doing fantastically and everything</text>
  <text start="536.779" dur="3.48">was looking great and they thought all</text>
  <text start="539.39" dur="3.089">of this was going</text>
  <text start="540.259" dur="4.98">come together with the event in Syria to</text>
  <text start="542.479" dur="6.15">get us into war and finally blame this</text>
  <text start="545.239" dur="6.51">entire war and then using a false flag</text>
  <text start="548.629" dur="5.52">event on the u.s. to say the other ones</text>
  <text start="551.749" dur="4.92">who collapse the economy and this is why</text>
  <text start="554.149" dur="4.951">we can taper at this point and what</text>
  <text start="556.669" dur="6.48">happened was that event didn&amp;#39;t happen so</text>
  <text start="559.1" dur="7.259">the Fed could not taper and all these</text>
  <text start="563.149" dur="7.02">oldest propaganda is now falling apart</text>
  <text start="566.359" dur="6.39">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing now today initial</text>
  <text start="570.169" dur="5.01">jobless claims spiked at 66,000 this</text>
  <text start="572.749" dur="4.92">week and they&amp;#39;re all out there saying</text>
  <text start="575.179" dur="4.71">that oh the reason why jobless claims</text>
  <text start="577.669" dur="5.28">are up is because the unemployment I</text>
  <text start="579.889" dur="5.37">mean the government furloughs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="582.949" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re applying for unemployment and</text>
  <text start="585.259" dur="3.36">the numbers are going up and also we</text>
  <text start="587.149" dur="3.21">have to look back at California they</text>
  <text start="588.619" dur="3.69">have some glitches in their systems and</text>
  <text start="590.359" dur="4.4">this is why we&amp;#39;re saying this right now</text>
  <text start="592.309" dur="5.19">and what is really happening is that</text>
  <text start="594.759" dur="4.69">they need to continually manipulate the</text>
  <text start="597.499" dur="4.98">numbers yes I&amp;#39;m sure the government</text>
  <text start="599.449" dur="6.961">shutdown added to this but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="602.479" dur="5.31">understand them applying for</text>
  <text start="606.41" dur="3.449">unemployment when they&amp;#39;re getting all</text>
  <text start="607.789" dur="6.24">their back pay and they&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="609.859" dur="6.241">paid twice now it makes no sense but we</text>
  <text start="614.029" dur="4.56">are seeing that they&amp;#39;re losing control</text>
  <text start="616.1" dur="4.56">of keeping the propaganda that the</text>
  <text start="618.589" dur="4.47">economy is getting better because we do</text>
  <text start="620.66" dur="4.799">understand that the housing market is</text>
  <text start="623.059" dur="5.34">starting to decline now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="625.459" dur="5.49">already making references that this</text>
  <text start="628.399" dur="4.92">shutdown is going to hurt the economy</text>
  <text start="630.949" dur="4.41">the longer it goes the worse it will be</text>
  <text start="633.319" dur="4.86">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see housing</text>
  <text start="635.359" dur="4.71">decline and we&amp;#39;re starting to see retail</text>
  <text start="638.179" dur="3.57">sales to suffer because the retailer&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="640.069" dur="3.48">can&amp;#39;t get their numbers from the</text>
  <text start="641.749" dur="3.99">government and this is going to hurt</text>
  <text start="643.549" dur="4.38">them and they&amp;#39;re making tons and tons of</text>
  <text start="645.739" dur="4.83">excuses but what have we seen we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="647.929" dur="5.07">layoff after layoff after lay off we saw</text>

  <text start="1416.1" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re selling all their oil by passing</text>
  <text start="1419.159" dur="3.961">the dollar and the central bankers will</text>
  <text start="1420.72" dur="5.22">not have this they need to put a puppet</text>
  <text start="1423.12" dur="4.71">government back into Iran and they need</text>
  <text start="1425.94" dur="3.839">to set up a private central western bank</text>
  <text start="1427.83" dur="3.78">because this is their ultimate plan to</text>
  <text start="1429.779" dur="3.03">prop up the US dollar and we see</text>
  <text start="1431.61" dur="4.02">throughout the Middle East which is</text>
  <text start="1432.809" dur="5.011">becoming unhinged right now a little bit</text>
  <text start="1435.63" dur="4.83">hard to control and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1437.82" dur="5.609">maintain control with force to keep the</text>
  <text start="1440.46" dur="7.26">US dollar propped up but once they lose</text>
  <text start="1443.429" dur="7.23">control the US dollar will come tumbling</text>
  <text start="1447.72" dur="6.24">down and before that happens they want</text>
  <text start="1450.659" dur="5.551">to get this war started now we</text>
  <text start="1453.96" dur="5.73">understand that the trucker&amp;#39;s are moving</text>
  <text start="1456.21" dur="5.31">into DC and they&amp;#39;re barreling down the</text>
  <text start="1459.69" dur="3.469">highway right now headed towards and</text>
  <text start="1461.52" dur="5.389">they&amp;#39;re supposed to arrive tomorrow and</text>
  <text start="1463.159" dur="7.931">there is claims that the Department of</text>
  <text start="1466.909" dur="6.841">Transportation says that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1471.09" dur="5.24">ordering the armed National Guard troops</text>
  <text start="1473.75" dur="6.51">to close Washington DC&amp;#39;s interstate</text>

  <text start="1482.84" dur="4.95">organized by a group called trucker&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1485.03" dur="4.68">ride for the Constitution and we can see</text>
  <text start="1487.79" dur="4.2">what they&amp;#39;re doing here they are trying</text>
  <text start="1489.71" dur="3.93">to make them angry and I would not be</text>
  <text start="1491.99" dur="4.98">surprised and this is a perfect</text>
  <text start="1493.64" dur="7.95">opportunity for the government to create</text>
  <text start="1496.97" dur="7.77">a distraction and to really set up some</text>
  <text start="1501.59" dur="6.18">type of false flag for the president to</text>
  <text start="1504.74" dur="5.28">declare a national emergency to declare</text>
  <text start="1507.77" dur="4.14">martial law because we have veterans</text>
  <text start="1510.02" dur="4.38">down there we have truckers down there</text>
  <text start="1511.91" dur="4.92">and we can see them that they could be</text>
  <text start="1514.4" dur="3.96">pushing this agenda forward and this is</text>
  <text start="1516.83" dur="3.66">just something to look at nellis not</text>
  <text start="1518.36" dur="5.01">saying that it will happen I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="1520.49" dur="5.31">this is something to look you know to</text>
  <text start="1523.37" dur="5.01">look at and this could be a potential</text>
  <text start="1525.8" dur="4.71">false flag coming down the line and we</text>
  <text start="1528.38" dur="5.85">can see the National Guard is being</text>
  <text start="1530.51" dur="6.99">pushed out there to close the 495 which</text>
  <text start="1534.23" dur="6.69">wraps around DC and we can definitely</text>
  <text start="1537.5" dur="6.27">see something happening in this area</text>
  <text start="1540.92" dur="9.48">during this weekend and we have to</text>
  <text start="1543.77" dur="9.66">remember that they would like nothing</text>
  <text start="1550.4" dur="5.73">more to declare a national emergency so</text>
  <text start="1553.43" dur="4.68">all power goes to the president he</text>
  <text start="1556.13" dur="4.89">doesn&amp;#39;t have to deal with Congress he</text>
  <text start="1558.11" dur="5.34">doesn&amp;#39;t have to deal with these voting</text>
  <text start="1561.02" dur="4.89">he can just do pretty much what he needs</text>
  <text start="1563.45" dur="7.44">to do and this could be a perfect</text>
  <text start="1565.91" dur="7.71">opportunity and we do understand and I</text>
  <text start="1570.89" dur="5.84">said this yesterday that there was a</text>
  <text start="1573.62" dur="6.72">doctor Paul Craig Roberts also said that</text>
  <text start="1576.73" dur="6.67">he could declare a national catastrophe</text>
  <text start="1580.34" dur="5.34">or natural emergency if we go past the</text>
  <text start="1583.4" dur="5.01">debt ceiling and Goldman is out there</text>
  <text start="1585.68" dur="4.68">saying that it&amp;#39;s clearly possible that</text>
  <text start="1588.41" dur="5.13">the final resolution might not be</text>
  <text start="1590.36" dur="6.66">reached until shortly after October 17th</text>
  <text start="1593.54" dur="6.72">which would enable the President to</text>
  <text start="1597.02" dur="6.03">declare a national emergency to keep the</text>
  <text start="1600.26" dur="7.44">continuity of the government working and</text>
  <text start="1603.05" dur="8.82">moving forward so this could all run</text>
  <text start="1607.7" dur="5.76">into one big type of event that is</text>
  <text start="1611.87" dur="4.289">coming because it is a perfect</text>
  <text start="1613.46" dur="5.91">opportunity for them to carry this out</text>
  <text start="1616.159" dur="6.031">and again we have to remember there are</text>
  <text start="1619.37" dur="5.88">so many different drills happening in a</text>
  <text start="1622.19" dur="8.19">six-week period that we could see a lot</text>
  <text start="1625.25" dur="10.76">of events happening in this time period</text>
  <text start="1630.38" dur="9.269">and I picked up on this very interesting</text>
  <text start="1636.01" dur="7.96">news article in it was on channel 2 news</text>
  <text start="1639.649" dur="7.41">investigation and this is another</text>
  <text start="1643.97" dur="6.24">potential false flag and let me read</text>
  <text start="1647.059" dur="6.901">this to you the 10 News investigators</text>
  <text start="1650.21" dur="6.03">have obtained an internal memo Koch</text>
  <text start="1653.96" dur="5.429">describes the events of 911 as an</text>
  <text start="1656.24" dur="5.1">incredible attack on us it was very well</text>
  <text start="1659.389" dur="5.28">orchestrated and they&amp;#39;re going to try it</text>
  <text start="1661.34" dur="6.54">again 100% no question in my mind</text>
  <text start="1664.669" dur="6.271">they&amp;#39;re going to try it again according</text>
  <text start="1667.88" dur="5.85">to koch many other flight crews are</text>
  <text start="1670.94" dur="5.579">concerned the planning may already be</text>
  <text start="1673.73" dur="6">underway there have been several cases</text>
  <text start="1676.519" dur="6.75">recently throughout the airline industry</text>
  <text start="1679.73" dur="7.23">of what appears to be probes or dry runs</text>
  <text start="1683.269" dur="8.4">to test our procedures and reactions to</text>
  <text start="1686.96" dur="6.809">an in-flight threat what most uncocks</text>
  <text start="1691.669" dur="4.951">says what most security experts will</text>
  <text start="1693.769" dur="7.801">tell you that if a dry run is occurring</text>
  <text start="1696.62" dur="10.049">the attack will shortly follow they told</text>
  <text start="1701.57" dur="8.37">TSA about this and TSA said it takes all</text>
  <text start="1706.669" dur="5.461">reports of suspicious activity aboard</text>
  <text start="1709.94" dur="4.8">aircraft seriously and the matter</text>
  <text start="1712.13" dur="7.019">requires no further investigation at</text>
  <text start="1714.74" dur="6.96">this time and this is what disturbs me</text>
  <text start="1719.149" dur="5.37">that they&amp;#39;re not going to look into it</text>
  <text start="1721.7" dur="7.02">and this is throwing up many red flags</text>
  <text start="1724.519" dur="6.361">right here however a current federal air</text>
  <text start="1728.72" dur="5.79">marshal who works four flights every</text>
  <text start="1730.88" dur="6.57">week says the TSA they&amp;#39;re liars they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1734.51" dur="5.19">flat-out liars the air marshals whose</text>
  <text start="1737.45" dur="3.609">identity we will not reveal because in</text>
  <text start="1739.7" dur="3.42">the agency rules pro</text>
  <text start="1741.059" dur="5.49">at him from talking to the media says</text>
  <text start="1743.12" dur="5.95">TSA doesn&amp;#39;t want the flying public to be</text>
  <text start="1746.549" dur="7.26">aware of the problems with terrorists</text>
  <text start="1749.07" dur="7.5">probes as the Federal Air Marshal and</text>
  <text start="1753.809" dur="6">industry insider tells us we&amp;#39;re waiting</text>
  <text start="1756.57" dur="6.859">for the next 911 to happen because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1759.809" dur="6.57">not a question of if it&amp;#39;s a question of</text>
  <text start="1763.429" dur="5.95">when and I have a link on here this is</text>
  <text start="1766.379" dur="7.441">from Channel 10 News investigating</text>
  <text start="1769.379" dur="6.841">report and we can see that this could be</text>
  <text start="1773.82" dur="5.67">another potential false flag I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="1776.22" dur="5.189">to put this on the x 22 report site and</text>
  <text start="1779.49" dur="3.75">for those people who are new and just</text>

  <text start="1793.499" dur="5.941">and map out what is happening here this</text>
  <text start="1796.44" dur="7.65">is a very disturbing investigation and</text>
  <text start="1799.44" dur="8.04">it shows us that there are plans being</text>
  <text start="1804.09" dur="5.73">made at this time we know for a fact</text>
  <text start="1807.48" dur="5.37">that there is going to be some type of</text>
  <text start="1809.82" dur="6.63">an event we saw and we saw out in</text>
  <text start="1812.85" dur="6.299">Arkansas that someone attacked the power</text>

  <text start="1831.84" dur="4.98">understand when we see these drills</text>
  <text start="1833.82" dur="5.37">usually a false flag is around the drill</text>
