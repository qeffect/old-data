  <text start="38.37" dur="5.7">28th 2016 and thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="41.31" dur="5.01">the current economic collapse news brief</text>
  <text start="44.07" dur="4.23">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="46.32" dur="4.77">collapse news now the government</text>
  <text start="48.3" dur="7.35">released its 2015 financial statements</text>
  <text start="51.09" dur="7.14">and once again the US government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="55.65" dur="6.18">financial condition has really declined</text>
  <text start="58.23" dur="5.67">significantly and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="61.83" dur="4.5">we see the government has reported about</text>
  <text start="63.9" dur="5.16">three point two trillion in total assets</text>
  <text start="66.33" dur="6.12">and these include things like bank</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="6.81">balances physical assets like tanks</text>
  <text start="72.45" dur="7.02">bullets highway system and many other</text>
  <text start="75.87" dur="7.56">things but the single biggest line item</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="6.38">is the 1.2 trillion in student loans</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="4.29">that are owed to the government</text>
  <text start="85.85" dur="4.59">thirty-seven percent of the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="87.72" dur="6.3">total reported assets are student loans</text>
  <text start="90.44" dur="7.56">which is now considered one of the</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="7.14">biggest bubbles that we have right now</text>
  <text start="98" dur="5.44">actually the 1.2 trillion is very</text>
  <text start="101.16" dur="3.81">similar to the size of the subprime</text>
  <text start="103.44" dur="4.32">mortgage market back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="4.56">eight and delinquency rates are rising</text>
  <text start="107.76" dur="4.37">now at eleven point five percent</text>
  <text start="109.53" dur="6.87">according to the Federal Reserve data on</text>
  <text start="112.13" dur="6.4">the other side of the equation we have</text>
  <text start="116.4" dur="4.77">about twenty one point five trillion and</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="4.62">liabilities giving the government and</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="4.98">official net worth of negative that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.15" dur="4.56">right- eighteen point two trillion this</text>
  <text start="126.15" dur="3.089">is down from last year&amp;#39;s negative</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="3.779">seventeen point seven trillion and</text>
  <text start="129.239" dur="5.131">negative sixteen point nine trillion the</text>
  <text start="131.489" dur="6.33">year before that it just keeps getting</text>
  <text start="134.37" dur="7.56">worst it just worse and worse as time</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="6.151">goes on but there&amp;#39;s one thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.93" dur="6.54">even more incredible about all of this</text>
  <text start="143.97" dur="6.659">that we&amp;#39;re talking about the financial</text>
  <text start="148.47" dur="4.89">statements they&amp;#39;re audited by the</text>
  <text start="150.629" dur="5.25">government&amp;#39;s in-house agency known as</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="6.689">the government accountability office now</text>
  <text start="155.879" dur="7.47">the ga o-- basically came out and said</text>
  <text start="160.049" dur="4.02">listen the government is on an</text>
  <text start="163.349" dur="6.12">unsustainable</text>
  <text start="164.069" dur="7.14">paintable fiscal path and we can see</text>
  <text start="169.469" dur="4.86">that this is absolutely true I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="171.209" dur="5.461">know if we need the GAO to tell us this</text>
  <text start="174.329" dur="4.08">because we can see it and what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="176.67" dur="3.09">happening all throughout the economy and</text>
  <text start="178.409" dur="4.591">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on</text>
  <text start="179.76" dur="5.069">we see that this entire path with the</text>
  <text start="183" dur="4.739">amount of debt the amount of spending</text>
  <text start="184.829" dur="4.981">the amount of revenue coming in this</text>
  <text start="187.739" dur="5.25">whole thing cannot be sustained it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="5.429">impossible and when you break everything</text>
  <text start="192.989" dur="7.53">down the government of the United States</text>
  <text start="195.239" dur="7.191">is totally bankrupt and as each year</text>
  <text start="200.519" dur="5.19">passes they become more and more</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="7.3">insolvent the situation is not getting</text>
  <text start="205.709" dur="5.64">better it is getting worse and worse now</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="5.399">we know the US government central</text>
  <text start="211.349" dur="6.03">bankers their entire agenda is to</text>
  <text start="215.129" dur="3.961">control the narrative of the story</text>
  <text start="217.379" dur="3.931">everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing everything</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="4.259">that we&amp;#39;re hearing they need to control</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="3.149">now we know the US government central</text>
  <text start="223.349" dur="3.84">bankers they have control of the</text>
  <text start="224.459" dur="5.071">creation of currency they have the</text>
  <text start="227.189" dur="4.38">control of the corporate media and of</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="4.229">course the problem is the internet that</text>
  <text start="231.569" dur="4.56">has always been the problem because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.759" dur="4.41">like the Wild West they can&amp;#39;t control it</text>
  <text start="236.129" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re trying to control it the best</text>
  <text start="238.169" dur="7.081">they can and many people probably don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="241.859" dur="6.78">realize that there was a meeting in</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="7.229">Silicon Valley of Hollywood the US</text>
  <text start="248.639" dur="8.22">government they came together to talk</text>
  <text start="252.479" dur="6.72">privately about fighting propaganda</text>
  <text start="256.859" dur="4.74">online now they&amp;#39;re using the cover story</text>
  <text start="259.199" dur="4.951">that they&amp;#39;re going to be fighting the</text>
  <text start="261.599" dur="5.181">Islamic state and their propaganda but</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="5.79">this is really not what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="266.78" dur="7.87">basically what happened is we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="269.94" dur="8.09">these people that all got together under</text>
  <text start="274.65" dur="7.259">the idea that they&amp;#39;re fighting terrorism</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="7.979">they&amp;#39;re fighting the Islamic state but</text>
  <text start="281.909" dur="8.551">they only invited a few Arab</text>
  <text start="286.009" dur="7.541">participants in this entire thing about</text>
  <text start="290.46" dur="6.4">ten percent of the attendees were Middle</text>
  <text start="293.55" dur="9.16">Eastern descent the rest</text>
  <text start="296.86" dur="9.899">were not and basically what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="302.71" dur="7.109">finding out from leaked memos from those</text>
  <text start="306.759" dur="4.831">people who attended we find out that</text>
  <text start="309.819" dur="3.241">Microsoft was their Facebook was there</text>
  <text start="311.59" dur="5.78">Apple was there Google was there</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="10.53">Mediacom was there edelman was there and</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="10.69">we see that these tech companies they</text>
  <text start="323.59" dur="7.319">were asked to tweak their algorithms to</text>
  <text start="328.06" dur="5.609">promote certain types of content when</text>
  <text start="330.909" dur="6.211">you do searches and we know this is</text>
  <text start="333.669" dur="8.24">already going on we already know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="337.12" dur="8.97">trying to basically mold and to create</text>
  <text start="341.909" dur="6.431">the idea that this is the true story and</text>
  <text start="346.09" dur="3.78">this is why there this is why they want</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="3.93">all this tweaked in a certain way</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="4.199">actually what&amp;#39;s very interesting those</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="4.649">days that we had the stock market</text>
  <text start="354.069" dur="6.06">completely crash and dropped by you know</text>
  <text start="356.919" dur="6.53">800 points a thousand points 500 points</text>
  <text start="360.129" dur="5.701">I went into Google on those days and</text>
  <text start="363.449" dur="4.451">what&amp;#39;s very interesting in the images</text>
  <text start="365.83" dur="4.589">section of Google I was trying to find</text>
  <text start="367.9" dur="4.859">different images of how Wall Street was</text>
  <text start="370.419" dur="5.12">reacting and you know when i type that</text>
  <text start="372.759" dur="6.12">in during those days only images of</text>
  <text start="375.539" dur="6">China were coming up nothing with the</text>
  <text start="378.879" dur="6.96">u.s. at all I couldn&amp;#39;t find anything and</text>
  <text start="381.539" dur="7.65">I found that very interesting when the</text>
  <text start="385.839" dur="6.091">Ukraine coup d&amp;#39;etat was taking place and</text>
  <text start="389.189" dur="6.461">there were battles going on in the</text>
  <text start="391.93" dur="8.25">southeastern section basically all they</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="10.259">showed were propaganda angles from the</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="8.97">Kyiv side that is it and we see this</text>
  <text start="405.909" dur="6.48">happen quite a bit because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.15" dur="5.819">trying to alter what we say and we know</text>
  <text start="412.389" dur="5.7">this we&amp;#39;ve been watching this we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="414.969" dur="6.361">following this because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="418.089" dur="4.89">get a hold and trying to recreate what</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="3.75">they once had where they were able to</text>
  <text start="422.979" dur="3.78">tell the entire story and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="425.08" dur="2.819">they have the power to control the</text>
  <text start="426.759" dur="2.671">currency they have the power to control</text>
  <text start="427.899" dur="2.461">the corporate media and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="4.289">trying to have the power to</text>
  <text start="430.36" dur="5.399">troll the internet and they won&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="433.719" dur="4.111">until they get that power and if they</text>
  <text start="435.759" dur="3.63">can&amp;#39;t get that power they&amp;#39;ll do what are</text>
  <text start="437.83" dur="3.54">the ones doing where he just basically</text>
  <text start="439.389" dur="3">says I&amp;#39;ll wait I don&amp;#39;t want you to see</text>
  <text start="441.37" dur="3.81">that I&amp;#39;m just going to cut the internet</text>

  <text start="469.99" dur="6.929">shelling in Ukraine they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="472.659" dur="6.63">gin up this next offensive we find out</text>
  <text start="476.919" dur="5.641">that yes the US government has been</text>
  <text start="479.289" dur="4.47">selling turkey bunker buster bombs they</text>
  <text start="482.56" dur="4.379">sold them for about six hundred and</text>
  <text start="483.759" dur="4.741">eighty million dollars we found this out</text>
  <text start="486.939" dur="4.98">from the disclosure by the US Department</text>
  <text start="488.5" dur="6.529">of Defense revealing that yes they did</text>
  <text start="491.919" dur="6.62">sell the BL you 109 bunker buster bombs</text>
  <text start="495.029" dur="7.901">to Turkey and this is being used in</text>
  <text start="498.539" dur="7.09">Syria we know that the ceasefire has</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="5.099">taken place over the weekend and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="505.629" dur="3.931">seen certain things occur we know that</text>
  <text start="508.029" dur="5.781">there was a lot of shelling going on</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="7.139">Damascus prior to the ceasefire deal</text>
  <text start="513.81" dur="6.399">there are about 20 blasts in Damascus</text>
  <text start="516.699" dur="5.731">they were shelling in there and we are</text>
  <text start="520.209" dur="6.021">seeing that there are still little</text>
  <text start="522.43" dur="8.04">skirmishes here and there and there are</text>
  <text start="526.23" dur="6.34">reports coming out that the syrian</text>
  <text start="530.47" dur="3.989">rebels the islamic state have been</text>
  <text start="532.57" dur="4.5">violating the ceasefire now on the other</text>
  <text start="534.459" dur="4.681">hand the syrian rebels are saying that</text>
  <text start="537.07" dur="6.509">the government forces of assad are</text>
  <text start="539.14" dur="6.9">violating the ceasefire but you have to</text>
  <text start="543.579" dur="5.551">remember the russian government and the</text>
  <text start="546.04" dur="5.87">Syrian government they discuss the</text>
  <text start="549.13" dur="5.67">ceasefire plan in the position of power</text>
  <text start="551.91" dur="5.44">they were winning the battle the Islamic</text>
  <text start="554.8" dur="4.56">state was being pushed out the rebels</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="6.87">were almost driven completely out of the</text>
  <text start="559.36" dur="7.5">country and basically Russia once a</text>
  <text start="564.22" dur="4.56">stopped it and said listen let&amp;#39;s have</text>
  <text start="566.86" dur="4.92">peace in the country because he knew at</text>
  <text start="568.78" dur="5.01">this point he had the upper edge he knew</text>
  <text start="571.78" dur="5.16">that the terrorist groups weren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="573.79" dur="5.64">to be involved in the ceasefire and at</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="5.36">this point he&amp;#39;d be able to pause the</text>
  <text start="579.43" dur="5.37">removal of Assad and continually fight</text>
  <text start="582.3" dur="7.9">against the terrorist groups Islamic</text>
  <text start="584.8" dur="9.18">state the al-qaeda al-nusrah and all the</text>
  <text start="590.2" dur="6">others and we can see right now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="593.98" dur="3.57">is basically backed in the corner now</text>
  <text start="596.2" dur="3.18">they had to go along with the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="5.21">because how would it look they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="599.38" dur="6.27">calling for peace calling for peace and</text>
  <text start="602.76" dur="5.08">basically they had no way or no</text>
  <text start="605.65" dur="3.78">alternative because they were losing the</text>
  <text start="607.84" dur="4.74">battle they were on the losing end if</text>
  <text start="609.43" dur="6.6">the US was on the upper hand they would</text>
  <text start="612.58" dur="5.1">have said no to peace at that point but</text>
  <text start="616.03" dur="5.16">we see other evidence that there were</text>
  <text start="617.68" dur="5.67">many many problems Russia&amp;#39;s new t90 tank</text>
  <text start="621.19" dur="4.11">which were delivered to Syria the tow</text>
  <text start="623.35" dur="4.08">missiles that the rebels were using the</text>
  <text start="625.3" dur="5.01">Islamic state were using they were</text>
  <text start="627.43" dur="6.17">obsolete at this point because the t-90</text>
  <text start="630.31" dur="6.78">tanks they had the ability to basically</text>
  <text start="633.6" dur="5.26">counter the us-made tow missiles so</text>
  <text start="637.09" dur="6.17">those are kind of obsolete in the battle</text>
  <text start="638.86" dur="7.14">at this point and we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="643.26" dur="6.01">that turkey which is part of the</text>
  <text start="646" dur="4.62">coalition forces is not obeying this</text>
  <text start="649.27" dur="3.6">cease fire and they said they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="650.62" dur="4.83">going to reports are coming in that</text>
  <text start="652.87" dur="5.34">turkey is using heavy artillery firing</text>
  <text start="655.45" dur="4.14">into Syria the information was verified</text>
  <text start="658.21" dur="3.54">through multiple channels including</text>
  <text start="659.59" dur="5.27">representatives of the Syrian democratic</text>
  <text start="661.75" dur="6.41">forces and Russia right now has</text>
  <text start="664.86" dur="6.79">requested clarification from the US on</text>
  <text start="668.16" dur="7.6">why turkey is doing this if they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="671.65" dur="6.21">part of the coalition forces and it</text>
  <text start="675.76" dur="4.2">really doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense at this</text>
  <text start="677.86" dur="3.78">point of why the u.s. can&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="679.96" dur="4.29">turkey if they&amp;#39;re really part of the</text>
  <text start="681.64" dur="5.85">coalition forces because they&amp;#39;re under</text>
  <text start="684.25" dur="6.39">orders to keep this going to make sure</text>
  <text start="687.49" dur="5.88">these areas remain open now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="690.64" dur="6.18">interesting about this ceasefire is that</text>
  <text start="693.37" dur="4.56">Russia has told Assad listen if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="696.82" dur="5.85">fired upon</text>
  <text start="697.93" dur="6.48">at this point do not fire back we want</text>
  <text start="702.67" dur="4.609">to make sure that everyone understands</text>
  <text start="704.41" dur="4.739">that we are upholding the cease-fire</text>
  <text start="707.279" dur="4.151">because we know the United States</text>
  <text start="709.149" dur="3.991">government we know turkey they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="711.43" dur="5.64">to continually try to gin this up and</text>
  <text start="713.14" dur="7.139">put pressure on the Syrian government</text>
  <text start="717.07" dur="6.53">side and the Russian side to try to fire</text>
  <text start="720.279" dur="7.711">back and say okay the ceasefire is off</text>
  <text start="723.6" dur="6.94">Russia during a Saturday decided to stop</text>
  <text start="727.99" dur="5.01">all bombing raids on the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="730.54" dur="4.65">at this point just to show that yes we</text>
  <text start="733" dur="5.22">are upholding the ceasefire and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="735.19" dur="6.709">stop the bombing runs right now but is</text>
  <text start="738.22" dur="6.75">this going to hold most likely not</text>
  <text start="741.899" dur="6.841">because we see already in Lebanon with</text>
  <text start="744.97" dur="8.6">all the travel advisories with the</text>
  <text start="748.74" dur="7.69">Saudis with guitar with Kuwait with</text>
  <text start="753.57" dur="5.26">united arab emirates they&amp;#39;re pulling</text>
  <text start="756.43" dur="5.58">their diplomats out of Lebanon they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="758.83" dur="5.82">telling people to get out of the area we</text>
  <text start="762.01" dur="7.41">can see that they&amp;#39;re in preparation for</text>
  <text start="764.65" dur="8.04">their next plan because as we know if</text>
  <text start="769.42" dur="7.28">there is peace true peace in Syria which</text>
  <text start="772.69" dur="8.67">I really truly hope there would be and</text>
  <text start="776.7" dur="6.4">if Russia or when Russia completely</text>
  <text start="781.36" dur="6">pushes the Islamic state out of the</text>
  <text start="783.1" dur="7.89">country the u.s. no longer needs to be</text>
  <text start="787.36" dur="5.43">in there now Russia understands that</text>
  <text start="790.99" dur="4.44">even if they push the Islamic state out</text>
  <text start="792.79" dur="5.28">they still have the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="795.43" dur="5.73">which is still the terrorist groups to</text>
  <text start="798.07" dur="5.97">deal with they know their mission is to</text>
  <text start="801.16" dur="5.369">go after Assad and he knows at this</text>
  <text start="804.04" dur="5.01">point this will not end if they just</text>
  <text start="806.529" dur="5.791">push the Islamic state out so he needs a</text>
  <text start="809.05" dur="5.46">way to create peace in the entire area</text>
  <text start="812.32" dur="5.22">and the u.s. cannot have this because as</text>
  <text start="814.51" dur="5.819">we know the petro dollar is collapsing</text>
  <text start="817.54" dur="4.53">they need to get into Syria they need to</text>
  <text start="820.329" dur="3.691">take it over they need to put a central</text>
  <text start="822.07" dur="4.17">bank in they need to put the natural</text>
  <text start="824.02" dur="4.23">resources on the dollar they need to</text>
  <text start="826.24" dur="3.69">build that pipeline they need eventually</text>
  <text start="828.25" dur="2.64">to go into Iran because Iran already</text>
  <text start="829.93" dur="2.22">stated that they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="830.89" dur="4.29">using the dollar on there</text>
  <text start="832.15" dur="10.04">oil and then they&amp;#39;re going to have to go</text>
  <text start="835.18" dur="10.35">back and go into Yemen Libya Iraq and</text>
  <text start="842.19" dur="7.99">basically can take complete control of</text>
  <text start="845.53" dur="8.01">all these areas to continually push the</text>
  <text start="850.18" dur="7.26">petro dollar on the world and this is</text>
  <text start="853.54" dur="5.49">the major problem right now so we need</text>
  <text start="857.44" dur="5.16">to look very closely because we know</text>
  <text start="859.03" dur="8.01">right now the u.s. the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="862.6" dur="5.88">are preparing their next move listen</text>
