  <text start="55.809" dur="5.311">when a jury poured my name is Dave ins</text>
  <text start="57.579" dur="6.151">episode 1660 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.12" dur="5.22">September 10th 2018 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="63.73" dur="4.8">the episode is the Fed and former Fed</text>
  <text start="66.34" dur="5.819">heads are now worried about the future</text>
  <text start="68.53" dur="6.51">of the Fed let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.159" dur="5.431">collapse financial news now as this</text>
  <text start="75.04" dur="6.03">economy continually breaks down and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="77.59" dur="5.49">talking about the real people&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="81.07" dur="4.409">the things that they feel in touch and</text>
  <text start="83.08" dur="4.56">they realize what is happening around</text>
  <text start="85.479" dur="4.021">them they realize that something is</text>
  <text start="87.64" dur="4.44">wrong something&amp;#39;s not right and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.5" dur="4.53">falling apart then we have these</text>
  <text start="92.08" dur="4.44">statistical numbers where we look at GDP</text>
  <text start="94.03" dur="4.08">we look at unemployment and you can</text>
  <text start="96.52" dur="5.04">completely manipulate these any way you</text>
  <text start="98.11" dur="7.02">want makes no difference whatsoever I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="101.56" dur="5.82">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is two</text>
  <text start="105.13" dur="4.11">separate things going on we have Trump</text>
  <text start="107.38" dur="3.96">of the Patriots out there where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="109.24" dur="3.54">using the manipulation that deep state</text>
  <text start="111.34" dur="3.93">the central bank has been using for a</text>
  <text start="112.78" dur="5.25">very long time and pushing it to the</text>
  <text start="115.27" dur="6.33">extreme at the same time they are</text>
  <text start="118.03" dur="6.089">preparing this country for a major major</text>
  <text start="121.6" dur="4.74">transition and we see there&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="124.119" dur="3.991">two narratives that are being set up by</text>
  <text start="126.34" dur="5.64">Trump and the Patriots we have the news</text>
  <text start="128.11" dur="6.3">of FISA the IG report which might bring</text>
  <text start="131.98" dur="4.849">down the entire system we also have the</text>
  <text start="134.41" dur="5.43">Fed raising rates at the same exact time</text>
  <text start="136.829" dur="5.951">so basically what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="139.84" dur="6.78">the economy is doing well if you look at</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="6.69">these fake statistical numbers and the</text>
  <text start="146.62" dur="4.91">economy behind the scenes is really</text>
  <text start="149.47" dur="5.579">falling apart and it&amp;#39;s accelerating</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="5.35">but Trump will have an out and this is</text>
  <text start="155.049" dur="5.16">why they set up these two narratives and</text>
  <text start="156.88" dur="6.78">this is where we are moving and we can</text>
  <text start="160.209" dur="6.511">see that the huge push back in June and</text>
  <text start="163.66" dur="5.07">July show that a lot of people were</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="4.13">using their credit cards to purchase now</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="5.67">again the central banks over time</text>
  <text start="170.85" dur="7.15">convinced us that debt was good put</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="5.52">yourself into debt it&amp;#39;s fantastic and if</text>
  <text start="178" dur="3.18">you notice the corporate media reports</text>
  <text start="179.92" dur="3.36">on debt</text>
  <text start="181.18" dur="5.55">well everyone used their credit cards</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="4.47">and it shows that the economy&amp;#39;s do</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="2.58">great because throughout their</text>
  <text start="187.75" dur="3.629">purchasing no it shows that people are</text>
  <text start="189.31" dur="4.02">going to do further and further debt</text>
  <text start="191.379" dur="4.651">their credit card interest rates are</text>
  <text start="193.33" dur="5.67">what twelve fifteen eighteen thirty</text>
  <text start="196.03" dur="4.59">thirty-five forty all depending on the</text>
  <text start="199" dur="3.03">credit card company it&amp;#39;s really like</text>
  <text start="200.62" dur="4.44">loan sharking actually if you really</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="6.26">think about it the Fed reported that in</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="5.819">July Consumer Credit posted a solid</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="6.52">rebound rising from sixteen point six</text>
  <text start="210.879" dur="6.211">billion above the 14.4 billion expected</text>
  <text start="214.81" dur="5.22">and bring the total to three point nine</text>
  <text start="217.09" dur="5.1">two trillion this is a five point one</text>
  <text start="220.03" dur="4.17">percent annualized increase from a year</text>
  <text start="222.19" dur="4.71">ago what does that mean it means</text>
  <text start="224.2" dur="5.039">revolving credit right now is at an</text>
  <text start="226.9" dur="3.119">all-time high like we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="229.239" dur="5.071">before</text>
  <text start="230.019" dur="7.44">and it shows you that people are using</text>
  <text start="234.31" dur="6.09">their credit cards to get by the problem</text>
  <text start="237.459" dur="6.271">is they hit the ceiling of their credit</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="7.08">cards Americans right now are tapped out</text>
  <text start="243.73" dur="5.91">and they&amp;#39;re struggling to get by and</text>
  <text start="247.48" dur="6.14">they&amp;#39;re using their credit cards to get</text>
  <text start="249.64" dur="7.529">by this is not a strong economy and</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="5.739">Trump is out there and he&amp;#39;s tweeting</text>
  <text start="257.169" dur="3.72">about the GDP numbers that GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="259.359" dur="3.421">came in around four point two percent</text>
  <text start="260.889" dur="3.991">the unemployment rate is at the lowest</text>
  <text start="262.78" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ve ever seen three point nine percent</text>
  <text start="264.88" dur="4.11">and he tweeted something like the GDP</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="2.88">rate four point two percent is higher</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="3.239">than the unemployment rate three point</text>
  <text start="270.31" dur="4.38">nine percent for the first time in over</text>
  <text start="272.229" dur="4.321">a hundred years now this statement is</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="3.72">actually kind of false because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="276.55" dur="5.04">seen this many many times before and</text>
  <text start="278.41" dur="4.92">people are pointing this out when I</text>
  <text start="281.59" dur="4.079">start to look at these things I start to</text>
  <text start="283.33" dur="4.559">realize I don&amp;#39;t think Trump is actually</text>
  <text start="285.669" dur="4.591">speaking to the American public when</text>
  <text start="287.889" dur="4.411">he&amp;#39;s tweeting these things out because</text>
  <text start="290.26" dur="5.42">if we look at some of his other tweets</text>
  <text start="292.3" dur="5.16">and we look at the recent tweet with</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="5.08">Barack Obama</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="6.57">we know that Obama was out there and he</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="7.8">was saying that you know this is my</text>
  <text start="304.03" dur="7.08">economy I made it better because I</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="5.52">inherited a an economy that was a</text>
  <text start="311.11" dur="4.98">disaster and I brought it up to this</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="5.68">point and Trump is just continuing this</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="4.72">well Trump tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="319.76" dur="3.63">and you&amp;#39;re gonna have to follow me on</text>
  <text start="320.81" dur="4.83">this now Obama in his tweet said the</text>
  <text start="323.39" dur="5.91">following president Trump will need a</text>
  <text start="325.64" dur="6.75">magic wand to get to 4% GDP this is</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="6.54">coming from Obama Trump said I guess I</text>
  <text start="332.39" dur="5.82">have a magic wand 4.2 percent and we</text>
  <text start="335.84" dur="5.01">will do much better than this we have</text>
  <text start="338.21" dur="4.2">just begun now think about what is</text>
  <text start="340.85" dur="3.48">happening here with all these tweets and</text>
  <text start="342.41" dur="4.14">going back and forth with the economy</text>
  <text start="344.33" dur="4.53">and Obama coming out of the woodwork now</text>
  <text start="346.55" dur="3.99">and speaking up this was not done on</text>
  <text start="348.86" dur="4.26">purpose they want him out there they</text>
  <text start="350.54" dur="6.6">want him out in the public because we</text>
  <text start="353.12" dur="5.37">know what&amp;#39;s coming and Obama&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="357.14" dur="4.38">you&amp;#39;re going to need a magic wand</text>
  <text start="358.49" dur="5.58">Trump he knows that this economy&amp;#39;s fake</text>
  <text start="361.52" dur="4.98">that he does have the magic wand right</text>
  <text start="364.07" dur="4.5">now he can make the economy look any way</text>
  <text start="366.5" dur="4.28">he wants he can make the numbers go up</text>
  <text start="368.57" dur="5.01">he can make the numbers go down it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="4.48">manipulated and I think when he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.58" dur="3.6">tweeting these things out it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="375.26" dur="3.9">really for the public but it&amp;#39;s for it</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="5.01">the central bankers it&amp;#39;s for the deep</text>
  <text start="379.16" dur="6.12">state I have full control over this</text>
  <text start="382.19" dur="5.31">economy I can make do whatever I want I</text>
  <text start="385.28" dur="5.88">can make it I can make GDP numbers go to</text>
  <text start="387.5" dur="8.76">5 6 7 % I can make unemployment go down</text>
  <text start="391.16" dur="9.21">to 2% it&amp;#39;s not real and he&amp;#39;s proving it</text>
  <text start="396.26" dur="6.62">by showing Obama I have the magic wand I</text>
  <text start="400.37" dur="5.13">am in full control right now</text>
  <text start="402.88" dur="4.39">now the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="405.5" dur="3.36">continually pushing the idea that these</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="5.13">tariffs are going to hurt the country</text>
  <text start="408.86" dur="8.04">yes maybe in the short term it will not</text>
  <text start="412.4" dur="7.62">be good but again under the central bank</text>
  <text start="416.9" dur="4.89">economy anything that&amp;#39;s being done right</text>
  <text start="420.02" dur="3.96">now is not going to be good because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.79" dur="5.58">not supposed to last this long they were</text>
  <text start="423.98" dur="7.62">expecting a war an event to cover up the</text>
  <text start="427.37" dur="5.4">collapse of the system and coming out of</text>
  <text start="431.6" dur="4.38">the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re saying well</text>
  <text start="432.77" dur="5.88">the US ports are fearing that these</text>
  <text start="435.98" dur="4.95">tariffs could collapse ship traffic and</text>
  <text start="438.65" dur="3.9">reduce jobs because if you have these</text>
  <text start="440.93" dur="3.03">tariffs in place they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="442.55" dur="3.39">we&amp;#39;re not going to be importing that</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="5.49">much because it&amp;#39;s very expensive</text>
  <text start="445.94" dur="4.83">well what about exporting so in the</text>
  <text start="449.45" dur="3.78">short term yes</text>
  <text start="450.77" dur="4.38">maybe the imports will slow</text>
  <text start="453.23" dur="4.47">maybe they won&amp;#39;t get the same amount of</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="6.21">steel but if we turn on the factories</text>
  <text start="457.7" dur="6.47">here in the US and start exporting the</text>
  <text start="461.36" dur="5.37">steel from the US out to other countries</text>
  <text start="464.17" dur="4.72">the people in the ports will guess what</text>
  <text start="466.73" dur="8.25">they still have their jobs they still</text>
  <text start="468.89" dur="8.97">can work so in the short term we might</text>
  <text start="474.98" dur="5.67">see hiccups now again this system was</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="4.38">not supposed to last this long we were</text>
  <text start="480.65" dur="3.72">supposed to have someone else in office</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="3.54">we were supposed to be going to a war</text>
  <text start="484.37" dur="3.78">they were supposed to cover this up we</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="5.43">were going to have a collapse so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.15" dur="6.63">definitely going in that direction but</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="6.24">things need to be changed so we can</text>
  <text start="494.78" dur="4.77">handle the collapse in a different way</text>
  <text start="497.45" dur="4.35">we don&amp;#39;t want to restart the system</text>
  <text start="499.55" dur="3.84">where the United States is an empty</text>
  <text start="501.8" dur="3.98">shell where we have no manufacturing we</text>
  <text start="503.39" dur="5.31">have no infrastructure we have no jobs</text>
  <text start="505.78" dur="5.35">everything that&amp;#39;s being done now is for</text>
  <text start="508.7" dur="3.719">the transition and moving away from the</text>
  <text start="511.13" dur="2.94">central bank and when we move away from</text>
  <text start="512.419" dur="3.301">the central bank and we&amp;#39;re no longer the</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="3.45">reserve currency remember the reserve</text>
  <text start="515.72" dur="5.64">currency is the dollar hooked to the</text>
  <text start="517.52" dur="6.42">petrol the dollar system which is the</text>
  <text start="521.36" dur="5.94">Middle East oil we&amp;#39;re coming off of this</text>
  <text start="523.94" dur="5.13">and this is going to be the transition</text>
  <text start="527.3" dur="3.9">so everything that&amp;#39;s going to be done</text>
  <text start="529.07" dur="4.62">yes in the short term yes we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="531.2" dur="5.19">see hiccup in the system yes people</text>
  <text start="533.69" dur="6.03">might be losing jobs but think about it</text>
  <text start="536.39" dur="4.74">in the other way if the central bankers</text>
  <text start="539.72" dur="3.42">were in control right now with the deep</text>
  <text start="541.13" dur="2.78">state and we had a different person in</text>
  <text start="543.14" dur="2.64">the white house</text>
  <text start="543.91" dur="3.28">everyone would be losing their job</text>
  <text start="545.78" dur="2.79">actually the United States would turn</text>
  <text start="547.19" dur="4.44">into a third-world country actually</text>
  <text start="548.57" dur="5.37">Trump mentioned this before this is what</text>
  <text start="551.63" dur="3.48">they were setting it up to be so they</text>
  <text start="553.94" dur="3.29">thought they were gonna lose their jobs</text>
  <text start="555.11" dur="6.63">before it was going to be a lot worse if</text>
  <text start="557.23" dur="7.78">it was the other way around here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="561.74" dur="5.64">going to make the u.s. a lot better by</text>
  <text start="565.01" dur="5.34">bringing back the manufacturing set it</text>
  <text start="567.38" dur="5.43">up setting it up for the transition now</text>
  <text start="570.35" dur="5.37">the Fed they are very nervous and afraid</text>
  <text start="572.81" dur="6.18">right now and there seems to be a</text>
  <text start="575.72" dur="5.85">growing concern these days about another</text>
  <text start="578.99" dur="4.11">epic financial crash on Wall Street and</text>
  <text start="581.57" dur="5.1">if we go back in history we saw many</text>
  <text start="583.1" dur="6.15">different crashes 29:33 in the 70s too</text>
  <text start="586.67" dur="5.1">thousand one two thousand eight two</text>
  <text start="589.25" dur="3.9">thousand nine so we saw a lot of these</text>
  <text start="591.77" dur="4.29">different crashes in these were all</text>
  <text start="593.15" dur="5.67">orchestrated by the central bank the Fed</text>
  <text start="596.06" dur="5.1">and last week JPMorgan Chase released a</text>
  <text start="598.82" dur="5.64">lengthy research report in which its</text>
  <text start="601.16" dur="5.43">analyst Marko Cala Novick suggested that</text>
  <text start="604.46" dur="4.74">an event of another major Wall Street</text>
  <text start="606.59" dur="4.71">crisis the Fed should not only have its</text>
  <text start="609.2" dur="5.82">emergency powers restored to buy up</text>
  <text start="611.3" dur="6.72">toxic debt but the Fed might also have</text>
  <text start="615.02" dur="4.95">to buy up stocks this time around aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="618.02" dur="3.78">they doing this already through the</text>
  <text start="619.97" dur="5.1">Swiss National Bank yeah</text>
  <text start="621.8" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re saying directly be out there</text>
  <text start="625.07" dur="5.25">buying the stocks showing the Fed</text>
  <text start="628.19" dur="4.08">actually buying the stocks not hiding it</text>
  <text start="630.32" dur="4.11">with another central bank now</text>
  <text start="632.27" dur="4.77">we need to understand why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.43" dur="5.97">looking to do this because a lot of the</text>
  <text start="637.04" dur="6.36">banks right now they were buying their</text>
  <text start="640.4" dur="4.11">own stock and if the stock market Falls</text>
  <text start="643.4" dur="4.11">what happens</text>
  <text start="644.51" dur="5.4">well these banks corporations that been</text>
  <text start="647.51" dur="5.34">doing this they go down the tubes and</text>
  <text start="649.91" dur="4.7">they&amp;#39;re very worried about this so this</text>
  <text start="652.85" dur="5.28">is why they&amp;#39;re making these suggestions</text>
  <text start="654.61" dur="5.68">where the Fed if we&amp;#39;re in another crisis</text>
  <text start="658.13" dur="4.08">they should purchase the stocks by</text>
  <text start="660.29" dur="2.82">creating a lot of currency and the</text>
  <text start="662.21" dur="3.66">government will have to give them</text>
  <text start="663.11" dur="5.1">permission to do this and they can go</text>
  <text start="665.87" dur="4.44">ahead create the currency and buy back</text>

  <text start="877.68" dur="8.8">showing us that the Fed lied that they</text>
  <text start="882.13" dur="6.93">were the lender of last resort and we</text>
  <text start="886.48" dur="5.73">can see that the Fed has been lying</text>
  <text start="889.06" dur="5.13">about a lot more and when the Fed is</text>
  <text start="892.21" dur="4.47">audited and when the fingers pointed at</text>
  <text start="894.19" dur="4.62">the Fed we&amp;#39;re gonna find out things that</text>
  <text start="896.68" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;ve never even known well we discussed</text>
  <text start="898.81" dur="4.11">them but it&amp;#39;s going to come out into the</text>
  <text start="900.64" dur="5.37">public domain and this is going to be</text>
  <text start="902.92" dur="5.73">the time period where they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="906.01" dur="5.52">pivot away from the central bank and</text>
  <text start="908.65" dur="5.1">those in Congress those in the White</text>
  <text start="911.53" dur="5.34">House those people in different states</text>
  <text start="913.75" dur="5.64">will say do we really need the central</text>

  <text start="919.39" dur="6.18">no it was a private company not working</text>
  <text start="923.95" dur="4.65">for the best interest of the American</text>
  <text start="925.57" dur="6.81">people and it&amp;#39;s time to take it over</text>
  <text start="928.6" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s time that the people control it</text>
  <text start="932.38" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s time that this works for the people</text>
  <text start="934.75" dur="7.37">and most likely it will be nationalized</text>
  <text start="937.45" dur="8.28">and the people will then control it and</text>
  <text start="942.12" dur="4.81">hopefully eventually we will get rid of</text>
  <text start="945.73" dur="3.09">it because the government doesn&amp;#39;t need</text>
