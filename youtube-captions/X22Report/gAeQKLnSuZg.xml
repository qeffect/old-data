  <text start="62.35" dur="5.76">August 9th 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="65.32" dur="6.24">episode is Central Bank caught and a lie</text>
  <text start="68.11" dur="5.58">everything is not what it seems let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.56" dur="4.47">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.69" dur="5.88">news now we&amp;#39;re starting to see a new</text>
  <text start="76.03" dur="5.339">trend with European banks and new</text>
  <text start="79.57" dur="4.589">statistical data from the investment</text>
  <text start="81.369" dur="5.701">bank Jefferies LLC well they revealed a</text>
  <text start="84.159" dur="4.831">startling new trend that could have</text>
  <text start="87.07" dur="5.219">major implications for Europe&amp;#39;s economic</text>
  <text start="88.99" dur="7.47">future now Italian banks they have begun</text>
  <text start="92.289" dur="7.801">dumping an unprecedented volume of</text>
  <text start="96.46" dur="7.17">Italian sovereign debt now the banks</text>
  <text start="100.09" dur="6.389">mass sell-off is most likely driven by</text>
  <text start="103.63" dur="5.31">these two factors first it is an attempt</text>
  <text start="106.479" dur="4.801">to preempt a pending basel three reform</text>
  <text start="108.94" dur="4.02">package that could eliminate the equity</text>
  <text start="111.28" dur="5.399">capital privilege for the EU government</text>
  <text start="112.96" dur="6.54">bonds and the second one is to position</text>
  <text start="116.679" dur="5.251">themselves for an anticipated autumn</text>
  <text start="119.5" dur="5.43">announcement from the ECB that they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="121.93" dur="6.27">begin tightening monetary policy now it</text>
  <text start="124.93" dur="6.48">looks like Spain Italy they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="128.2" dur="6.48">to realize that sovereign debt might not</text>
  <text start="131.41" dur="6.44">be the place to be in a world of rising</text>
  <text start="134.68" dur="7.13">interest rates now if they&amp;#39;re selling</text>
  <text start="137.85" dur="7.24">sovereign debt who is buying it well as</text>
  <text start="141.81" dur="7.239">we can see there&amp;#39;s only one player that</text>
  <text start="145.09" dur="7.29">can purchase this type of debt it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="149.049" dur="4.53">central banks the ECB the Fed and this</text>
  <text start="152.38" dur="4.5">is what&amp;#39;s been happening</text>
  <text start="153.579" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing all of this debt</text>
  <text start="156.88" dur="5.46">now the ECB over bought Italian</text>
  <text start="160.359" dur="4.111">government debt in July with purchases</text>
  <text start="162.34" dur="4.32">of about nine point six billion euros</text>
  <text start="164.47" dur="5.73">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="166.66" dur="5.97">is that the central bank they surpassed</text>
  <text start="170.2" dur="3.99">its own capital key rules by which</text>
  <text start="172.63" dur="4.71">member state debt is bought in</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="7.109">proportion to the size of each country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="177.34" dur="6.929">economy and we see right now the central</text>
  <text start="181.299" dur="5.19">banks they are taking up the slack and</text>
  <text start="184.269" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;re purchasing all this and banks</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="2.911">are</text>
  <text start="187.209" dur="4.381">loading their sovereign debt because</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="3.959">they know what&amp;#39;s going to happen they</text>
  <text start="191.59" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t want to be holding on to this when</text>
  <text start="193.359" dur="3.571">the economies around the world come</text>
  <text start="195.37" dur="3.599">crashing down they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="196.93" dur="5.16">holding on to this when interest rates</text>
  <text start="198.969" dur="5.13">rise when the stimulus stops they know</text>
  <text start="202.09" dur="3.84">what&amp;#39;s going to happen and this is why</text>
  <text start="204.099" dur="5.821">we see this happening at this point</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="7.19">now 2016 was just revised down to the</text>
  <text start="209.92" dur="7.92">worst year for US productivity since</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="8.47">1982 and when we look at the economy as</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="5.91">a whole we see it is completely falling</text>
  <text start="221.59" dur="5.16">apart and we mentioned that you US</text>
  <text start="223.75" dur="5.76">companies they are leveraged more than</text>
  <text start="226.75" dur="5.579">ever and when we look at this when we</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="6.479">look at the corporation&amp;#39;s over the last</text>
  <text start="232.329" dur="6.481">10 years S&amp;amp;P 500 corporations they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="235.989" dur="5.43">returned more money to shareholders via</text>
  <text start="238.81" dur="5.909">share buybacks and dividends than</text>
  <text start="241.419" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;ve earned at eight point six</text>
  <text start="244.719" dur="5.931">trillion corporate debt levels are 30%</text>
  <text start="246.939" dur="8.61">higher today than at their prior peak in</text>
  <text start="250.65" dur="6.459">September of 2008 at forty five point</text>
  <text start="255.549" dur="5.3">three percent the ratio of corporate</text>
  <text start="257.109" dur="8.221">debt to GDP is at historical highs</text>
  <text start="260.849" dur="7.871">surpassing the levels from the last two</text>
  <text start="265.33" dur="5.91">previous recessions so when we look at</text>
  <text start="268.72" dur="5.879">the corporation&amp;#39;s right now US</text>
  <text start="271.24" dur="7.769">corporations are simultaneously more</text>
  <text start="274.599" dur="7.41">indebted less profitable and more highly</text>
  <text start="279.009" dur="5.16">valued than they have been in a long</text>
  <text start="282.009" dur="3.84">time plus they are intentionally making</text>
  <text start="284.169" dur="3.691">themselves more leveraged by</text>
  <text start="285.849" dur="5.07">distributing cash as dividends and</text>
  <text start="287.86" dur="6.059">buying back shares so we can see right</text>
  <text start="290.919" dur="6.351">now the corporation&amp;#39;s they are worse off</text>
  <text start="293.919" dur="6.93">than they were during the recessions and</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="7.329">we could see that the stock market that</text>
  <text start="300.849" dur="6.721">is just one gigantic illusion because we</text>
  <text start="304.599" dur="5.94">know who&amp;#39;s manipulating this well we</text>
  <text start="307.57" dur="7.439">know that the Swiss National Bank they</text>
  <text start="310.539" dur="6.12">own a record 84 billion in US stocks now</text>
  <text start="315.009" dur="3.96">if you talked about this in the past</text>
  <text start="316.659" dur="4.421">people would say no that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="318.969" dur="3.641">they&amp;#39;re not the ones purchasing this</text>
  <text start="321.08" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re not supposed to be in the stock</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="3.42">market that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s been manipulating</text>
  <text start="324.23" dur="4.35">the market they&amp;#39;re really not supposed</text>
  <text start="326.03" dur="7.73">to have a trading desk but what it turns</text>
  <text start="328.58" dur="8.07">out to be is absolutely true they own a</text>
  <text start="333.76" dur="5.11">lot of the stock same thing with the</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="4.44">Bank of Japan same thing with the Fed</text>
  <text start="338.87" dur="4.62">and we need to understand something the</text>
  <text start="341.09" dur="4.41">central banks it&amp;#39;s not in their mandate</text>
  <text start="343.49" dur="3.929">to tell you the truth actually they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="345.5" dur="3.51">tell you everything else everything that</text>
  <text start="347.419" dur="2.701">you don&amp;#39;t want to hear but the truth</text>
  <text start="349.01" dur="2.82">that&amp;#39;s not one of the things they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.12" dur="3.81">going to tell you actually they will</text>
  <text start="351.83" dur="3.48">tell you more lies on top of lies to</text>
  <text start="353.93" dur="3.96">make it look like it&amp;#39;s the truth</text>
  <text start="355.31" dur="4.71">but it&amp;#39;s really just a lie and this is</text>
  <text start="357.89" dur="4.95">what we found out a hundred and three</text>
  <text start="360.02" dur="5.19">years later now believe me throughout</text>
  <text start="362.84" dur="3.75">this time the central banks if we go</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="3.78">back in time when we start nitpicking</text>
  <text start="366.59" dur="4.35">and every little thing we will find out</text>
  <text start="368.99" dur="5.04">that they&amp;#39;ve been lying about every</text>
  <text start="370.94" dur="5.55">single thing and we know from what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="374.03" dur="4.17">been looking at because we can see it we</text>
  <text start="376.49" dur="3.75">know they can see bubbles they know that</text>
  <text start="378.2" dur="3.81">we know that they create the bubbles we</text>
  <text start="380.24" dur="3.09">know that they know when it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="382.01" dur="2.25">be a recession because they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="383.33" dur="3.93">who caused it they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="384.26" dur="5.969">control it but when you really look at</text>
  <text start="387.26" dur="5.78">this you can see that the central banks</text>
  <text start="390.229" dur="6.661">they are not telling the truth</text>
  <text start="393.04" dur="8.08">whatsoever now thanks to the Financial</text>
  <text start="396.89" dur="8.31">Times there is proof now that essential</text>
  <text start="401.12" dur="5.7">banks actually told a lie and this might</text>
  <text start="405.2" dur="3.57">be the first recorded instance of a</text>
  <text start="406.82" dur="3.96">central bank openly lying in attempt to</text>
  <text start="408.77" dur="4.38">preserve market stability and getting</text>
  <text start="410.78" dur="4.47">caught on Tuesday the Bank of England</text>
  <text start="413.15" dur="5.1">admitted that the UK government failed</text>
  <text start="415.25" dur="7.14">to find enough investors to fully cover</text>
  <text start="418.25" dur="6.33">its 1914 war Leung and was forced to</text>
  <text start="422.39" dur="6.26">turn to the central bank to help plug a</text>
  <text start="424.58" dur="7.83">deficit of more than a hundred million</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="6.7">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that they</text>
  <text start="432.41" dur="6.42">lied to the public that the bond was</text>
  <text start="435.35" dur="6.18">oversubscribed now they made claims it</text>
  <text start="438.83" dur="4.56">was swamped with buyers the 1914 war</text>
  <text start="441.53" dur="4.13">loan raised less than a third of its</text>
  <text start="443.39" dur="4.71">three hundred and fifty million target</text>
  <text start="445.66" dur="4.21">attracting a very narrow set of</text>
  <text start="448.1" dur="3.66">investors and according to the Bank of</text>
  <text start="449.87" dur="3.96">England employees riding on the bank</text>
  <text start="451.76" dur="3.24">underground website the bloggers</text>
  <text start="453.83" dur="2.82">uncovered the cover</text>
  <text start="455" dur="4.14">by trawling through the banks old</text>
  <text start="456.65" dur="5.13">Ledger&amp;#39;s and they found out that yes</text>
  <text start="459.14" dur="5.79">they lied about all of this and it was</text>
  <text start="461.78" dur="6.48">the central banks that were buying this</text>
  <text start="464.93" dur="5.88">up so why lie about this for the same</text>
  <text start="468.26" dur="5.49">reason to this day central bankers</text>
  <text start="470.81" dur="6.42">around the world lie at every possible</text>
  <text start="473.75" dur="6.3">opportunity to preserve confidence to</text>
  <text start="477.23" dur="6.09">pretend that they are keeping the</text>
  <text start="480.05" dur="6.06">economy moving along to make everyone</text>
  <text start="483.32" dur="6.27">think that everything is great before</text>
  <text start="486.11" dur="5.07">they bring it down now ironically be</text>
  <text start="489.59" dur="3.78">Financial Times which reported the Bank</text>
  <text start="491.18" dur="4.37">of England&amp;#39;s blog finding was</text>
  <text start="493.37" dur="4.92">instrumental in publicizing and</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="5.62">disseminating the lie on November 23rd</text>
  <text start="498.29" dur="5.49">1914 something which may have accused a</text>
  <text start="501.17" dur="4.35">paper of doing today and they played</text>
  <text start="503.78" dur="5.73">their role in convincing the public that</text>
  <text start="505.52" dur="6.27">the sale was a success and it turns out</text>
  <text start="509.51" dur="3.69">to be a complete lie and if we look at</text>
  <text start="511.79" dur="2.73">today at all the things that central</text>
  <text start="513.2" dur="5.7">bank has been doing where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="514.52" dur="6.27">covertly sending funds overseas to</text>
  <text start="518.9" dur="5.1">different banks where they&amp;#39;re covertly</text>
  <text start="520.79" dur="6.99">pushing stimulus where they&amp;#39;re buying up</text>
  <text start="524" dur="6.87">bonds having a secret trading desk in</text>
  <text start="527.78" dur="5.22">the Fed controlling the stock market all</text>
  <text start="530.87" dur="4.26">of this a lot is a lie now many people</text>
  <text start="533" dur="5.49">are out there saying no no this can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="535.13" dur="7.02">true but once again as we can see the</text>
  <text start="538.49" dur="6.69">truth always seems to seep out and the</text>
  <text start="542.15" dur="5.88">truth is always displayed and everyone</text>
  <text start="545.18" dur="5.1">can actually see it now does the truth</text>
  <text start="548.03" dur="4.26">come out right away no sometimes you</text>
  <text start="550.28" dur="4.14">gotta wait a couple years and at that</text>
  <text start="552.29" dur="4.65">time nobody really cares anymore because</text>
  <text start="554.42" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s maybe a couple generations you know</text>
  <text start="556.94" dur="4.41">far removed from when it really actually</text>
  <text start="559.4" dur="4.11">happened almost like you know the</text>
  <text start="561.35" dur="5.43">Kennedy assassination 9/11 eventually</text>
  <text start="563.51" dur="5.76">those truths will come out people will</text>
  <text start="566.78" dur="4.47">discover and we already have but a lot</text>
  <text start="569.27" dur="3.81">of it will be out there so everyone can</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="5.64">see it and more people will see it and</text>
  <text start="573.08" dur="5.88">say hey that was a lie now here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="576.89" dur="4.53">truth but again you won&amp;#39;t have the same</text>
  <text start="578.96" dur="4.77">reaction because they wait for a long</text>
  <text start="581.42" dur="6.12">period of time so it&amp;#39;s many generations</text>
  <text start="583.73" dur="5.52">away from when the actual event occurred</text>
  <text start="587.54" dur="4.68">now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at many different</text>
  <text start="589.25" dur="4.53">indicators on how the economy is really</text>
  <text start="592.22" dur="3.78">doing and we know that the Fed well</text>
  <text start="593.78" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re removing their indicator and I</text>
  <text start="596" dur="4.26">have to say that was pretty darn exact</text>
  <text start="598.16" dur="3.57">when we looked at that indicator but</text>
  <text start="600.26" dur="3.69">they want to remove it right now so</text>
  <text start="601.73" dur="4.14">nobody knows what&amp;#39;s going on well thanks</text>
  <text start="603.95" dur="5.97">to Jesse Felder there is another</text>
  <text start="605.87" dur="6.14">economic indicator that allows us to</text>
  <text start="609.92" dur="5.49">look at what&amp;#39;s called the real</text>
  <text start="612.01" dur="7.57">value-added now this economic indicator</text>
  <text start="615.41" dur="9.36">has reliably signaled every recession</text>
  <text start="619.58" dur="7.62">since 1948 and the data point real value</text>
  <text start="624.77" dur="5.96">added is currently in a negative</text>
  <text start="627.2" dur="3.53">territory and may therefore be</text>
  <text start="631.03" dur="5.95">forecasting an economic downturn now if</text>
  <text start="634.88" dur="5.69">it is a full signal it would be the</text>
  <text start="636.98" dur="6.42">first one in in a 70 year history</text>
  <text start="640.57" dur="5.11">observing this economic indicator now</text>
  <text start="643.4" dur="6.33">when we look at the gross value added</text>
  <text start="645.68" dur="7.26">and the real value added the gross value</text>
  <text start="649.73" dur="5.61">added is a measure of economic activity</text>
  <text start="652.94" dur="4.26">like GDP but it&amp;#39;s formulated a little</text>
  <text start="655.34" dur="4.74">differently it is the it is the</text>
  <text start="657.2" dur="5.13">production side of the economy it</text>
  <text start="660.08" dur="5.67">measures the dollar value of all goods</text>
  <text start="662.33" dur="5.1">and services produce less all the costs</text>
  <text start="665.75" dur="5.52">required to produce those goods or</text>
  <text start="667.43" dur="6.99">services so for example if you buy a</text>
  <text start="671.27" dur="5.64">hundred dollars worth of wood and 20</text>
  <text start="674.42" dur="4.94">dollars worth of other materials and it</text>
  <text start="676.91" dur="5.73">takes thirty dollars to employ people</text>
  <text start="679.36" dur="5.5">for labor to build the chair we produced</text>
  <text start="682.64" dur="4.11">a good for about a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="684.86" dur="3.77">bucks now if we sell that good for</text>
  <text start="686.75" dur="4.71">twenty four two hundred dollars it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="688.63" dur="7.36">fifty dollars which is the economic</text>
  <text start="691.46" dur="9.9">value of this product and when we look</text>
  <text start="695.99" dur="9.39">at the real value added since 1948 we</text>
  <text start="701.36" dur="8.37">can see that each time the real value</text>
  <text start="705.38" dur="12.36">drops below zero there is a recession</text>
  <text start="709.73" dur="12.5">and we go back to 1948 1954 1957 1962</text>
  <text start="717.74" dur="14.25">if we look at 1969 all the way up to</text>
  <text start="722.23" dur="10.66">1974 1981 1990 2000 2001 2008 2009 guess</text>

  <text start="928.52" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re already in the recession actually</text>
  <text start="930.02" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;ve never left the recession has just</text>
  <text start="932.33" dur="5.16">gotten worse as time has gone on now yes</text>
  <text start="935.78" dur="3.27">the Fed has pumped it up with all the</text>
  <text start="937.49" dur="4.23">stimulus just like you can do this with</text>
  <text start="939.05" dur="4.74">someone who is on steroids where you can</text>
  <text start="941.72" dur="4.29">pump up the muscles and over a period of</text>
  <text start="943.79" dur="4.14">time it looks fantastic but it does hurt</text>
  <text start="946.01" dur="6.33">the body you can also say this about a</text>
  <text start="947.93" dur="5.97">drug addict who&amp;#39;s on drugs where yes</text>
  <text start="952.34" dur="3.33">once they get the drug they feel good</text>
  <text start="953.9" dur="4.17">everything is great but once you remove</text>
  <text start="955.67" dur="5.25">the drugs their world comes crashing</text>
  <text start="958.07" dur="4.83">down around them and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="960.92" dur="4.14">exactly what is happening right now the</text>
  <text start="962.9" dur="6.96">entire system has been pumped up on</text>
  <text start="965.06" dur="8.31">drugs and eventually as you keep pumping</text>
  <text start="969.86" dur="5.73">the drugs in the patient dies or if you</text>
  <text start="973.37" dur="4.89">remove the drugs the patient goes</text>
  <text start="975.59" dur="4.88">through a massive withdrawal process and</text>
  <text start="978.26" dur="6.03">this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen here if</text>
  <text start="980.47" dur="5.88">they keep pumping the system with drugs</text>
  <text start="984.29" dur="3.959">guess what the whole system just</text>
  <text start="986.35" dur="3.159">automatically dies and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="999.169" dur="6.33">to blame it on someone else and this is</text>
  <text start="1003.309" dur="5.07">why they&amp;#39;re deciding to do this now</text>
  <text start="1005.499" dur="4.95">because they want to control what is</text>
  <text start="1008.379" dur="4.68">happening and they realize that the</text>
  <text start="1010.449" dur="5.31">stimulus it&amp;#39;s not doing anything anymore</text>
