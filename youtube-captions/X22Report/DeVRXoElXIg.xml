  <text start="87.32" dur="5.31">a complete and utter breakdown and what</text>
  <text start="90.38" dur="5.07">the central bank&amp;#39;s normally do at this</text>
  <text start="92.63" dur="5.159">point is they try to get everyone in</text>
  <text start="95.45" dur="3.72">they they have built the illusion to the</text>

  <text start="121.52" dur="7.17">bit they&amp;#39;re confident that the economy</text>
  <text start="125.69" dur="6.48">will end up doing a lot better and the</text>

  <text start="251.87" dur="7.89">now where they&amp;#39;re going to challenge the</text>
  <text start="256.359" dur="7.211">US dollar of the petro dollar now pepe</text>
  <text start="259.76" dur="5.76">escobar recently noted to overcome the</text>

  <text start="268.37" dur="3.24">Politis</text>
  <text start="269.03" dur="5.25">way of stating what the BRICS have been</text>
  <text start="271.61" dur="5.13">discussing for years now how to bypass</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="2.759">the US dollar as well as the petro</text>
  <text start="276.74" dur="2.7">dollar</text>
  <text start="277.039" dur="4.56">this means that Russia as well as Iran</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="5.64">the other key node of Eurasian</text>
  <text start="281.599" dur="5.551">integration may bypass US sanctions by</text>
  <text start="285.08" dur="5.67">trading energy in their own currencies</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="6.63">or nuan inbuilt in the move is a true</text>
  <text start="290.75" dur="5.16">Chinese win-win do you want according to</text>
  <text start="293.78" dur="4.94">some will be fully convertible in the</text>
  <text start="295.91" dur="6.539">gold on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="298.72" dur="6.91">exchanges the new triad of oil you want</text>
  <text start="302.449" dur="5.161">and gold is actually a win-win-win no</text>
  <text start="305.63" dur="3.93">problem at all if energy providers</text>
  <text start="307.61" dur="4.38">prefer to be paid in physical gold</text>
  <text start="309.56" dur="7.08">instead of you wand the key message is</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="6.39">the US dollar being bypassed and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="316.64" dur="3.72">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="318.38" dur="4.62">that they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="320.36" dur="4.799">this agenda right now now we need to</text>
  <text start="323" dur="4.02">remember the central bankers they need a</text>
  <text start="325.159" dur="4.47">country that has incredible</text>
  <text start="327.02" dur="6.57">manufacturing will have the reserve</text>
  <text start="329.629" dur="7.35">currency of the world will have how has</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="5.94">a lot of gold because what central</text>
  <text start="336.979" dur="5.25">bankers need to do is they need to</text>
  <text start="339.53" dur="4.289">rebuild confidence in the system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="342.229" dur="3.21">almost like going back to the Great</text>
  <text start="343.819" dur="4.231">Depression and everyone lost confidence</text>
  <text start="345.439" dur="5.13">in the banking system what did they do</text>
  <text start="348.05" dur="5.88">to get everyone back into the banking</text>
  <text start="350.569" dur="7.291">system everyone back in to the system</text>
  <text start="353.93" dur="8.549">what they did was they created the FDIC</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="8.029">saying listen if the banks go down no</text>
  <text start="362.479" dur="9.451">problem you&amp;#39;re insured by the government</text>
  <text start="365.889" dur="9.49">we will pay out what you have lost their</text>
  <text start="371.93" dur="5.239">new system that they&amp;#39;re creating not</text>
  <text start="375.379" dur="4.141">saying that this is going to work</text>
  <text start="377.169" dur="4.18">because we have two different paths that</text>
  <text start="379.52" dur="4.889">we could be going on their system and</text>
  <text start="381.349" dur="7.53">our system people&amp;#39;s system they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="384.409" dur="6.421">to build confidence with gold because</text>
  <text start="388.879" dur="4.981">the countries around the world are gonna</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="5.82">look at this and say well what can we</text>
  <text start="393.86" dur="6.75">get from you if something happens oh we</text>
  <text start="396.65" dur="6.689">can give you gold this is why China has</text>
  <text start="400.61" dur="4.709">been accumulating gold and I know people</text>
  <text start="403.339" dur="3.45">say well gold it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not worth</text>
  <text start="405.319" dur="4.53">anything you don&amp;#39;t need it anymore</text>
  <text start="406.789" dur="7.05">you still need it countries don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="409.849" dur="7.44">purchase gold just to purchase it they</text>
  <text start="413.839" dur="8.01">purchase it because it&amp;#39;s a confidence</text>
  <text start="417.289" dur="8.641">builder and when you&amp;#39;re moving to a new</text>
  <text start="421.849" dur="6.6">system the world needs confidence right</text>
  <text start="425.93" dur="4.829">now the crypto system yes that might be</text>
  <text start="428.449" dur="4.861">used on a local level for each country</text>
  <text start="430.759" dur="5.46">to trade and purchase and things like</text>
  <text start="433.31" dur="5.909">that but on a higher level countries</text>
  <text start="436.219" dur="6.271">want to know that if something happens</text>
  <text start="439.219" dur="8.781">what is there what can I get my hands on</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="9.149">which will retain value that is gold and</text>
  <text start="448" dur="5.86">we can see right now</text>
  <text start="451.639" dur="5.641">this is what the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="5.79">trying to do now is this the end of the</text>
  <text start="457.28" dur="5.729">petrodollar in the Mideast actually yes</text>
  <text start="459.65" dur="7.319">but really the u1 has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="463.009" dur="5.671">it if the u.s. no longer runs trade</text>
  <text start="466.969" dur="5.04">deficits with the Mideast</text>
  <text start="468.68" dur="6.359">they no longer need to accumulate US</text>
  <text start="472.009" dur="6.451">dollar reserves China is now the biggest</text>
  <text start="475.039" dur="5.97">importer of crude in the world if China</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="5.31">starts running perpetual trade deficits</text>
  <text start="481.009" dur="6.87">with OPEC countries it makes sense for</text>
  <text start="483.77" dur="6.66">OPEC to hold you wan reserves as long as</text>
  <text start="487.879" dur="5.94">the OPEC countries trusts do you want</text>
  <text start="490.43" dur="6.63">remember trust the yuan how do you build</text>
  <text start="493.819" dur="5.28">trust you put something behind it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="4.02">not saying they&amp;#39;re gonna say oh you want</text>
  <text start="499.099" dur="4.5">is backed by gold but you have gold</text>
  <text start="501.08" dur="6.03">there they&amp;#39;re gonna show the gold it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.599" dur="5.94">going to build confidence Russia might</text>
  <text start="507.11" dur="5.19">even step in and say listen we have gold</text>
  <text start="509.539" dur="7.29">also so if something happens the BRIC</text>
  <text start="512.3" dur="7.77">nations we are okay we can show you that</text>
  <text start="516.829" dur="4.981">we can support all of this this is what</text>
  <text start="520.07" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="521.81" dur="5.19">the move right now now this is gonna</text>
  <text start="523.55" dur="5.07">happen in march i&amp;#39;m not saying as soon</text>
  <text start="527" dur="4.14">as the state hits everything&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="528.62" dur="6.57">change but they&amp;#39;re slowly ramping it up</text>
  <text start="531.14" dur="7.29">and we can see right now as this builds</text>
  <text start="535.19" dur="5.82">in popularity and as countries start to</text>
  <text start="538.43" dur="6.089">trust they&amp;#39;re going to move away from</text>
  <text start="541.01" dur="5.699">the dollar yes other countries are</text>
  <text start="544.519" dur="3.601">looking at crypto currencies but i</text>
  <text start="546.709" dur="3.87">believe there&amp;#39;s going to be different</text>
  <text start="548.12" dur="4.8">levels of currency i believe there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="550.579" dur="4.021">going to be a local level currency and i</text>
  <text start="552.92" dur="4.02">believe there&amp;#39;s going to be a very high</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="4.32">level currency where countries will use</text>
  <text start="556.94" dur="5.16">it to trade back and forth might even be</text>
  <text start="558.92" dur="5.22">based on the blockchain but we can see</text>
  <text start="562.1" dur="4.41">right now it all depends on who actually</text>
  <text start="564.14" dur="6.809">controls this is at the central bank or</text>
  <text start="566.51" dur="6.12">the people if we go down the path of the</text>
  <text start="570.949" dur="4.83">crypto currency and is completely</text>
  <text start="572.63" dur="5.28">controlled by the people and the</text>
  <text start="575.779" dur="3.451">government&amp;#39;s create this currency and</text>
  <text start="577.91" dur="2.669">this is the currency that we use in the</text>
  <text start="579.23" dur="2.729">country and there&amp;#39;s no central banks</text>
  <text start="580.579" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s no interest attached to it and</text>
  <text start="581.959" dur="3.861">we get rid of the central banks things</text>
  <text start="584.779" dur="3.441">will be a lot better off</text>
  <text start="585.82" dur="5.28">but we can see the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="588.22" dur="5.76">don&amp;#39;t play clean they play dirty they</text>
  <text start="591.1" dur="5.1">don&amp;#39;t want to lose control and all of</text>
  <text start="593.98" dur="6.38">this is being pushed forward right now</text>
  <text start="596.2" dur="8.13">and they&amp;#39;re making their move remember</text>
  <text start="600.36" dur="7.45">reserve currencies do not last forever I</text>
  <text start="604.33" dur="7.38">mean if we go back in time from like the</text>
  <text start="607.81" dur="7.04">Year 1450 or so Portugal all the way up</text>
  <text start="611.71" dur="6.96">to the 1500s had the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="614.85" dur="8.44">Spain back in like fifteen twenty five</text>
  <text start="618.67" dur="5.94">to fifteen or sixteen hundred they had</text>
  <text start="623.29" dur="4.86">the reserve currency then the</text>
  <text start="624.61" dur="6.99">Netherlands then France then Britain and</text>
  <text start="628.15" dur="6.54">now the US so when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="631.6" dur="5.4">can see that going back in time yes</text>
  <text start="634.69" dur="4.59">there was a period of time where</text>
  <text start="637" dur="5.13">countries had the reserve currency the</text>
  <text start="639.28" dur="6.36">central banking system only lasts for a</text>
  <text start="642.13" dur="5.49">certain period of time and that is it so</text>
  <text start="645.64" dur="4.26">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="647.62" dur="4.38">entire system the global economy not</text>
  <text start="649.9" dur="4.35">just the US it&amp;#39;s all breaking down we</text>
  <text start="652" dur="4.8">talked about how the housing market is</text>
  <text start="654.25" dur="5.13">imploding in Canada how it&amp;#39;s imploding</text>
  <text start="656.8" dur="4.17">around the United States except for the</text>
  <text start="659.38" dur="3.84">20 cities where they keep pumping up the</text>
  <text start="660.97" dur="4.35">prices yes they can pump up the bubbles</text>
  <text start="663.22" dur="4.14">but eventually what happens is these</text>
  <text start="665.32" dur="4.56">bubbles all around the country will</text>
  <text start="667.36" dur="4.53">start to pop it&amp;#39;s not yes it&amp;#39;s under one</text>
  <text start="669.88" dur="3.96">gigantic umbrella but there&amp;#39;s inside</text>
  <text start="671.89" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s many different little bubbles</text>
  <text start="673.84" dur="3.51">and when they start to pop it brings</text>
  <text start="675.58" dur="4.02">down the whole thing so we have little</text>
  <text start="677.35" dur="4.47">bubbles popping just like we saw in 2008</text>
  <text start="679.6" dur="5.1">whoa something was happening California</text>
  <text start="681.82" dur="6.99">but guess what Miami was fine something</text>
  <text start="684.7" dur="6.84">was happening out in the eastern part of</text>
  <text start="688.81" dur="4.68">the country we&amp;#39;re in New York but Miami</text>
  <text start="691.54" dur="4.35">was okay and then eventually what</text>
  <text start="693.49" dur="3.9">happened all the bubbles started to pop</text>
  <text start="695.89" dur="3.6">and then we just have one gigantic</text>
  <text start="697.39" dur="6.09">bubble that pop the same thing is going</text>
  <text start="699.49" dur="7.59">to happen now we we realize and we</text>
  <text start="703.48" dur="6.33">understand that this system was not</text>
  <text start="707.08" dur="5.76">designed to last forever the central</text>
  <text start="709.81" dur="6.27">banking system is designed to take as</text>
  <text start="712.84" dur="6.15">much wealth as possible from the people</text>
  <text start="716.08" dur="3.54">from the countries and then restart it</text>
  <text start="718.99" dur="3">once</text>
  <text start="719.62" dur="6.15">again and do the same thing over and</text>
  <text start="721.99" dur="6.51">over and over until they amass a huge</text>
