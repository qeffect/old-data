  <text start="87.58" dur="4.14">they are sticking to the Russian</text>
  <text start="89.44" dur="4.23">collusion obstruction story and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="91.72" dur="3.78">continually pushing the idea that Muller</text>
  <text start="93.67" dur="5.1">holds the answers and they need to</text>
  <text start="95.5" dur="5.82">impeach Trump this is a complete dead</text>

  <text start="107.47" dur="4.74">from the Russian story and they say</text>

  <text start="112.21" dur="5.699">Russian anything everything else falls</text>
  <text start="115.6" dur="5.64">apart and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="117.909" dur="6.331">pushing the idea that Muller holds the</text>
  <text start="121.24" dur="6.33">key Muller must testify mother mother</text>
  <text start="124.24" dur="7.77">mother but this is a complete dead end</text>
  <text start="127.57" dur="8.54">and Trump was at a rally in Orlando</text>
  <text start="132.01" dur="9.33">yesterday and he basically came out and</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="9.4">told the people exactly what is</text>
  <text start="141.34" dur="8.1">happening and he gave very important</text>
  <text start="145.51" dur="6.11">information on what they have and will</text>
  <text start="149.44" dur="6.42">be getting into that in just a moment</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="7.089">but talking about Muller and the Russian</text>
  <text start="155.86" dur="5.19">story we have Adam Schiff out there and</text>
  <text start="158.709" dur="4.11">representative Jim Himes and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="161.05" dur="4.65">both out there saying that Muller</text>
  <text start="162.819" dur="4.98">to testify well how doesn&amp;#39;t matter how</text>
  <text start="165.7" dur="4.14">he will testify even if we have to</text>
  <text start="167.799" dur="3.871">subpoena him and they&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="169.84" dur="3.84">this for a very long time Nadler is out</text>
  <text start="171.67" dur="5.31">there saying this and they keep saying</text>
  <text start="173.68" dur="5.25">time is running out well if time is</text>
  <text start="176.98" dur="4.86">running out then go ahead and just</text>
  <text start="178.93" dur="6.809">subpoena Muller why don&amp;#39;t you just do</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="6.539">this well I believe they won&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="185.739" dur="5.7">and if they do it would be a shock to</text>
  <text start="188.379" dur="4.771">everyone if they actually get Butler in</text>
  <text start="191.439" dur="3.69">to testify and if they do have them</text>
  <text start="193.15" dur="4.559">testify they&amp;#39;re gonna try to do it</text>
  <text start="195.129" dur="4.741">behind closed doors or they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="197.709" dur="3.601">try to do it without the Republicans and</text>
  <text start="199.87" dur="3.539">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to use their staff</text>
  <text start="201.31" dur="6.149">lawyers to ask Muller the right</text>
  <text start="203.409" dur="6.66">questions think about why they really</text>
  <text start="207.459" dur="5.761">don&amp;#39;t want to have Muller up there and</text>
  <text start="210.069" dur="6.03">why this is a propaganda stunt if they</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="4.739">do have Muller testify they need to do</text>
  <text start="216.099" dur="3.78">it in public and not behind closed doors</text>
  <text start="217.959" dur="4.411">if they do it in private there goes</text>
  <text start="219.879" dur="4.29">their argument of transparency and being</text>
  <text start="222.37" dur="4.14">open with the public they have been</text>
  <text start="224.169" dur="3.871">arguing about this that we need the full</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="3.21">report we need all the evidence we have</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="3.509">to be open with the public has to be</text>
  <text start="229.72" dur="5.22">completely transparent so if they go</text>
  <text start="231.549" dur="6.18">into the backroom and have this</text>
  <text start="234.94" dur="5.579">discussion with Muller well there goes</text>
  <text start="237.729" dur="6.57">that whole entire story that they were</text>
  <text start="240.519" dur="6.271">pushing if Muller testifies in front of</text>
  <text start="244.299" dur="4.83">Congress well there&amp;#39;s a problem there</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="4.14">they got Jordan meadows gates Collins</text>
  <text start="249.129" dur="5.911">they&amp;#39;ll be asking the tough questions</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="7.83">and this will not go along with their</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="6.96">narrative if they decide to have their</text>
  <text start="258.76" dur="5.67">staff lawyers questioned Muller and</text>
  <text start="262" dur="3.479">that&amp;#39;s it and of course this is going to</text>
  <text start="264.43" dur="3.63">be designed to ask very specific</text>
  <text start="265.479" dur="6.151">questions and none of the questions that</text>
  <text start="268.06" dur="6.9">anyone else would ask it will be seen as</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="8.37">a setup and it will not look favorably</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="9.84">on the Dems and it will not work this is</text>
  <text start="280" dur="8.9">why I do believe that Muller most likely</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="8.1">will not testify at all in front of</text>
  <text start="288.9" dur="5.68">Congress in front of the public now they</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="3.66">might try to do behind closed doors but</text>
  <text start="294.58" dur="3.57">for the reasons that we just mentioned</text>
  <text start="296.56" dur="5.64">this is going to be a major major</text>
  <text start="298.15" dur="6.57">problem and if time is running out just</text>
  <text start="302.2" dur="5.13">subpoena him already do it let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="304.72" dur="6">what he really has to say and let&amp;#39;s ask</text>
  <text start="307.33" dur="5.82">the real questions hmm I think they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="310.72" dur="5.52">little nervous and afraid to ask the</text>
  <text start="313.15" dur="6.81">real questions now we understand that</text>
  <text start="316.24" dur="6.57">Roger stone he is going after the crown</text>
  <text start="319.96" dur="6.3">strike reports and again we know the FBI</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="6.09">they really didn&amp;#39;t say any of this and I</text>
  <text start="326.26" dur="4.379">don&amp;#39;t believe CrowdStrike I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="328.9" dur="4.26">believe they have them I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="330.639" dur="3.661">he&amp;#39;s going to get the unredacted reports</text>
  <text start="333.16" dur="4.08">from CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="334.3" dur="5.55">at all I think they&amp;#39;re gonna try to push</text>
  <text start="337.24" dur="4.23">this off to make sure that he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="339.85" dur="4.71">get anything because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="341.47" dur="8.21">anything and this is going to be a major</text>
  <text start="344.56" dur="8.81">major problem for the deep state why</text>
  <text start="349.68" dur="7.56">because this was the whole basis of</text>
  <text start="353.37" dur="7.53">Russia hacking the DNC in the DCCC and</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="8.86">this is going to be a major problem and</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="8.53">this will expose Clinton Obama and the</text>
  <text start="366.1" dur="7.55">rest there move on Roger stone was a</text>
  <text start="369.43" dur="8.609">really stupid move on their part because</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="8.44">discovery allows stone to go after all</text>
  <text start="378.039" dur="5.791">this information and now they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="382.09" dur="4.41">to be in trouble of course they made</text>
  <text start="383.83" dur="4.559">this move thinking that Muller was going</text>
  <text start="386.5" dur="4.139">to issue the report showing Russian</text>
  <text start="388.389" dur="5.15">collusion obstruction and they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="390.639" dur="6.75">have to worry about that but guess what</text>
  <text start="393.539" dur="6.611">now they&amp;#39;re worrying how do we know</text>
  <text start="397.389" dur="4.981">they&amp;#39;re worrying well we&amp;#39;re getting word</text>
  <text start="400.15" dur="4.5">that Obama is panicking how do we know</text>
  <text start="402.37" dur="5.94">this well there was a Newsweek article</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="7.019">that came out and it says Barack Obama</text>
  <text start="408.31" dur="6.45">is very concerned about country will get</text>
  <text start="411.669" dur="4.951">involved in 2020 campaign and this is</text>
  <text start="414.76" dur="6.84">coming before coming from a former</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="6.54">adviser so a senior advisor to Obama has</text>
  <text start="421.6" dur="5.79">said that the president is deeply</text>
  <text start="423.16" dur="7.23">concerned about the direction of the US</text>
  <text start="427.39" dur="7.05">and that the two-term president plans to</text>
  <text start="430.39" dur="7.26">be involved yeah because he&amp;#39;s worried</text>
  <text start="434.44" dur="8.46">he&amp;#39;s panicking that if Trump stays in</text>
  <text start="437.65" dur="9.63">office and continues he will have full</text>
  <text start="442.9" dur="6.93">power over the deep state and everything</text>
  <text start="447.28" dur="6.12">that they&amp;#39;ve done which means he will</text>
  <text start="449.83" dur="5.01">push out the D class the OIG and the</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="3.84">rest now it&amp;#39;s not him</text>
  <text start="454.84" dur="4.5">specifically it&amp;#39;s going to be bar</text>
  <text start="457.24" dur="5.34">because bar is in charge and actually</text>
  <text start="459.34" dur="6.87">this was a very very smart move on</text>
  <text start="462.58" dur="7.44">Trump&amp;#39;s part because Trump is not</text>
  <text start="466.21" dur="7.86">declassifying it bar is declassifying it</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="7.2">and guess what it won&amp;#39;t show that Trump</text>
  <text start="474.07" dur="5.19">is doing it for political reasons bar is</text>
  <text start="477.22" dur="4.38">handling the investigation so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.26" dur="4.23">separate and apart from Trump now of</text>
  <text start="481.6" dur="4.2">course they&amp;#39;re gonna try to say oh he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.49" dur="5.52">pushing this for political reasons but</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="6">when bar comes out with the facts the</text>
  <text start="489.01" dur="7.41">truth and it shows that these people did</text>
  <text start="491.8" dur="6.15">treasonous illegal criminal things while</text>
  <text start="496.42" dur="4.56">their whole entire story completely</text>
  <text start="497.95" dur="6.69">falls apart and Trump by the way he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.98" dur="5.37">been telling the story about what has</text>
  <text start="504.64" dur="3.84">happened through his tweet now I went</text>
  <text start="506.35" dur="4.44">through some of his tweets here and I</text>
  <text start="508.48" dur="5.58">can&amp;#39;t read all of them because we be</text>
  <text start="510.79" dur="5.73">here for days but I took out some of the</text>
  <text start="514.06" dur="6.27">important ones and this is going back to</text>
  <text start="516.52" dur="6.959">July 25th 2017 and I do believe he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.33" dur="6.63">been doing this since he came into his</text>
  <text start="523.479" dur="5.571">presidency to tell the story of what</text>
  <text start="526.96" dur="5.34">really has been happening here and</text>
  <text start="529.05" dur="5.89">allowing the mainstream media to pick it</text>
  <text start="532.3" dur="5.18">up and argue about it but the</text>
  <text start="534.94" dur="7.76">information is still getting out there</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="7.81">so his tweet on July 25th 2017 said</text>

  <text start="1976.669" dur="4.441">these are already against the law</text>
  <text start="1978.669" dur="5.111">anything that calls for violence and</text>
  <text start="1981.11" dur="4.08">tells people to go out and push violence</text>

  <text start="2000.07" dur="3.15">people are gonna run out and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2001.63" dur="3.39">gonna cause harm it&amp;#39;s against the law</text>

  <text start="2005.02" dur="4.44">and you yell fire you&amp;#39;re allowed to do</text>

  <text start="2009.46" dur="7.65">have laws on the books that already</text>
  <text start="2013.24" dur="6.72">represent freedom of speech so their</text>
  <text start="2017.11" dur="6.93">argument doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now very</text>
  <text start="2019.96" dur="6.51">interestingly with Afghanistan it seems</text>
  <text start="2024.04" dur="5.85">like we&amp;#39;re getting closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="2026.47" dur="7.35">a deal and the Taliban is announcing</text>
  <text start="2029.89" dur="7.159">that the US and the Taliban have agreed</text>
  <text start="2033.82" dur="6.03">that US is going to remove troops from</text>
  <text start="2037.049" dur="5.771">Afghanistan now of course the u.s.</text>
  <text start="2039.85" dur="5.16">spokesperson says yes we have the basic</text>
  <text start="2042.82" dur="4.53">framework but we haven&amp;#39;t ironed out all</text>
  <text start="2045.01" dur="3.899">the details but I do believe that this</text>
  <text start="2047.35" dur="3.69">is heading in the say in the right</text>
  <text start="2048.909" dur="4.591">direction and I do believe the troops</text>
  <text start="2051.04" dur="4.319">will be removed from Afghanistan they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2053.5" dur="4.47">also be removed from Syria and remember</text>
  <text start="2055.359" dur="6.211">Trump is fighting those individuals</text>
  <text start="2057.97" dur="5.4">still that want war in these areas and</text>
  <text start="2061.57" dur="5.13">he&amp;#39;s trying to end</text>
  <text start="2063.37" dur="4.89">all of these endless wars now Trump said</text>
  <text start="2066.7" dur="4.56">something very very interesting in</text>
  <text start="2068.26" dur="5.67">regards to Iran he was asked about his</text>
  <text start="2071.26" dur="5.43">position with Iran as he left the White</text>
  <text start="2073.93" dur="5.07">House for his campaign rally in Florida</text>
  <text start="2076.69" dur="4.53">yesterday and he says we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="2079" dur="5.01">Iran we have a lot of things going on</text>
  <text start="2081.22" dur="5.91">with Iran were very prepared for Iran</text>
  <text start="2084.01" dur="6.39">and we&amp;#39;ll see what happens now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2087.13" dur="6.54">very interesting that were prepared for</text>
  <text start="2090.4" dur="5.97">Iran were prepared for them to make a</text>
  <text start="2093.67" dur="4.41">deal and he always says we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="2096.37" dur="4.32">happens he already knows what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="2098.08" dur="6.18">happen because behind the scenes behind</text>
  <text start="2100.69" dur="7.89">all of this that&amp;#39;s going on the deal is</text>
  <text start="2104.26" dur="6.99">already being done and remember all</text>
  <text start="2108.58" dur="5.28">those players like Obama Kerry the</text>
  <text start="2111.25" dur="2.88">European leaders they all have skin in</text>
  <text start="2113.86" dur="3.12">the game</text>
  <text start="2114.13" dur="5.31">I believe they profited from all of this</text>
  <text start="2116.98" dur="4.29">and I&amp;#39;m sure there are other things that</text>
  <text start="2119.44" dur="4.56">we know of that have been going on and</text>
  <text start="2121.27" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re out there trying to</text>
  <text start="2124" dur="6.93">keep this all together but it looks like</text>
  <text start="2126.94" dur="7.5">it&amp;#39;s falling apart and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="2130.93" dur="7.41">people of Iran they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="2134.44" dur="6.24">fighting back against those deep state</text>
  <text start="2138.34" dur="6.33">operatives inside of Iran and we know</text>
