  <text start="587.329" dur="7.021">2.4% is pitifully low in an economy that</text>
  <text start="591.98" dur="5.31">supposedly in its sixth year of economic</text>
  <text start="594.35" dur="5.46">growth because unemployment is down to</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="5.31">five point three percent if all those</text>
  <text start="599.81" dur="6.36">jobs have been created why is retail</text>
  <text start="602.6" dur="6.929">contracting and they got this number not</text>
  <text start="606.17" dur="8.76">by sales increasing but by shutting down</text>
  <text start="609.529" dur="8.641">stores and getting rid of all the extra</text>
  <text start="614.93" dur="7.8">inventory all the extra work force so</text>
  <text start="618.17" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re showing an increase in sales but</text>
  <text start="622.73" dur="6.95">what we&amp;#39;re really seeing if we look at</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="7.949">this is a complete decline in sales</text>
  <text start="629.68" dur="5.399">retail sales are actually far worse than</text>

  <text start="666.41" dur="6.57">decidedly dark and getting darker by the</text>
  <text start="668.809" dur="6.411">day let&amp;#39;s look at macys their sales have</text>
  <text start="672.98" dur="5.099">fallen by two-point-six percent Kohl&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="675.22" dur="5.159">they were able to push their sales up 20</text>
  <text start="678.079" dur="5.581">point six percent this is pathetic</text>
  <text start="680.379" dur="5.77">considering we&amp;#39;re down to five point</text>
