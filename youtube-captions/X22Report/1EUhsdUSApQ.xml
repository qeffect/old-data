  <text start="33.26" dur="7.41">today&amp;#39;s date is sep tember 12 2013 and</text>
  <text start="37.28" dur="6.239">the title of this episode is the Fed</text>
  <text start="40.67" dur="7.5">says tapering is necessary and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="43.519" dur="7.56">going to be painful and we can see by</text>
  <text start="48.17" dur="5.939">what the Fed did back a couple months</text>
  <text start="51.079" dur="5.16">ago they did a litmus test to see what</text>
  <text start="54.109" dur="5.37">would happen if they mentioned tapering</text>
  <text start="56.239" dur="5.81">and and we saw the markets completely</text>
  <text start="59.479" dur="5.851">take a plunge for that period of time</text>
  <text start="62.049" dur="6.911">and that was their test to understand</text>
  <text start="65.33" dur="7.05">that they were the market they are the</text>
  <text start="68.96" dur="6.27">housing market they are the economy and</text>
  <text start="72.38" dur="5.28">they know this they realize this and</text>
  <text start="75.23" dur="4.02">they know what&amp;#39;s going on and this is</text>
  <text start="77.66" dur="4.8">why we continually get these little</text>
  <text start="79.25" dur="8.96">hints that tampering is going to be</text>
  <text start="82.46" dur="9.5">painful tapering is necessary tapering a</text>
  <text start="88.21" dur="7.45">little bit tapering this tapering that</text>
  <text start="91.96" dur="6.63">most likely they will not taper at all</text>
  <text start="95.66" dur="5.88">because they realize if they do taper</text>
  <text start="98.59" dur="5.73">everything will just completely fall</text>
  <text start="101.54" dur="6.09">apart the stock market the real estate</text>
  <text start="104.32" dur="5.68">bubble the Treasury bond bubble the</text>
  <text start="107.63" dur="4.86">student loan bubble everything would</text>
  <text start="110" dur="7.26">completely collapse if they started</text>

  <text start="193.04" dur="7.32">into the economic collapse news now we</text>
  <text start="196.76" dur="5.52">see out in australia that the</text>
  <text start="200.36" dur="5.189">unemployment rate in australia is</text>
  <text start="202.28" dur="5.37">climbing and it reached around six</text>
  <text start="205.549" dur="6.121">percent last month for the first time</text>
  <text start="207.65" dur="5.43">since august of 2009 and australia cut</text>
  <text start="211.67" dur="3.48">ten thousand eight hundred jobs in</text>
  <text start="213.08" dur="6.45">august as its mining investment boom</text>
  <text start="215.15" dur="7.22">slowed down and amongst many sectors we</text>
  <text start="219.53" dur="4.65">are seeing hiring restraints or shedding</text>
  <text start="222.37" dur="4.48">including construction retail</text>
  <text start="224.18" dur="6.24">manufacturing and there is no signal</text>
  <text start="226.85" dur="5.46">that this is going to improve this goes</text>
  <text start="230.42" dur="4.44">on to say we are concerned the</text>
  <text start="232.31" dur="4.649">mainstream economy may not be growing</text>
  <text start="234.86" dur="3.99">sufficiently to keep a lid on an</text>
  <text start="236.959" dur="7.881">unemployment rate which is trending</text>
  <text start="238.85" dur="12.449">higher so this entire private western</text>
  <text start="244.84" dur="12.57">central bank model is taking its toll on</text>
  <text start="251.299" dur="11.551">every single country and Europe is is</text>
  <text start="257.41" dur="8.74">declining quite rapidly the u.s. the</text>
  <text start="262.85" dur="4.89">economy is declining let&amp;#39;s not talk</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="4.889">about the stock market because that is</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="5.14">not a gauge of the economy and we are</text>
  <text start="271.039" dur="4.871">seeing this all across</text>
  <text start="272.88" dur="7.86">the globe now and because the debt and</text>
  <text start="275.91" dur="7.38">this model cannot be sustained and it it</text>
  <text start="280.74" dur="5.13">we can see that everything is starting</text>
  <text start="283.29" dur="4.86">to move the opposite way even though the</text>
  <text start="285.87" dur="4.86">government government officials are</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="4.38">still out there using the propaganda</text>
  <text start="290.73" dur="4.77">telling everyone that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="292.53" dur="5.34">everything is doing well and it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="295.5" dur="4.05">because of manipulated numbers you have</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="6.06">to remember the u.s. manipulates</text>
  <text start="299.55" dur="8.04">unemployment GDP and inflation and they</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="6.06">do this to keep everyone asleep so they</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t realize what is really going on</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="7.56">and especially now with food stamps you</text>
  <text start="312.33" dur="7.47">do not see lines you get a an EBT card</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="4.17">and it looks like a credit card so no</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="6.09">one really knows you don&amp;#39;t see food</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="6.51">lines people are taken care of by the</text>
  <text start="325.89" dur="6.18">government who is continually borrowing</text>
  <text start="328.23" dur="5.34">money increasing the debt and this is</text>
  <text start="332.07" dur="4.83">why the US government is hitting that</text>
  <text start="333.57" dur="6.33">debt ceiling again now in Greece the</text>
  <text start="336.9" dur="9.63">unemployment rate hit twenty seven point</text>
  <text start="339.9" dur="9.45">nine percent it in May it was at 27.6</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="8.94">and now in June the report comes in that</text>
  <text start="349.35" dur="8.34">it&amp;#39;s at 27.9 and there is a report</text>
  <text start="355.47" dur="6.93">they&amp;#39;re saying that 25 million more</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="7.26">Europeans at risk of poverty and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="362.4" dur="4.86">the only people benefiting from</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="4.77">austerity are the richest ten percent of</text>
  <text start="367.26" dur="5.4">Europeans who alone have seen their</text>
  <text start="369.72" dur="5.7">wealth rise greece ireland italy</text>
  <text start="372.66" dur="4.74">portugal spain and the UK countries that</text>
  <text start="375.42" dur="3.78">are most aggressively pursuing austerity</text>
  <text start="377.4" dur="4.62">measures will soon rank amongst the most</text>
  <text start="379.2" dur="5.61">unequal in the world if their leaders</text>
  <text start="382.02" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t change course and this goes on to</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="6.06">say here for example the gap between</text>
  <text start="387.03" dur="6.47">rich and poor in the UK and Spain could</text>
  <text start="390.87" dur="6.39">become the same as in South Sudan or</text>
  <text start="393.5" dur="5.92">paraguay and you know we see this all</text>
  <text start="397.26" dur="4.44">over I mean right now they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="399.42" dur="5.13">that illy housing market is facing an</text>
  <text start="401.7" dur="4.929">ongoing collapse yesterday reported on</text>
  <text start="404.55" dur="6.319">Francis</text>
  <text start="406.629" dur="6.91">housing problem and Spain again is a has</text>
  <text start="410.869" dur="5.311">a housing problem so we can see this is</text>
  <text start="413.539" dur="5.791">completely spreading to every single</text>
  <text start="416.18" dur="6.09">country there&amp;#39;s no way that countries</text>
  <text start="419.33" dur="6.559">that have double-digit unemployment that</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="7.019">are continually going up can maintain</text>
  <text start="425.889" dur="7.691">the debt levels of the country and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.289" dur="7.58">all starting to fall apart now and even</text>
  <text start="433.58" dur="7.169">though the government officials will not</text>
  <text start="436.869" dur="6.85">admit to this we can see it by looking</text>
  <text start="440.749" dur="6.84">at different data and I just want to go</text>
  <text start="443.719" dur="5.19">back for a second prior to two thousand</text>
  <text start="447.589" dur="4.32">eight or even during the Great</text>
  <text start="448.909" dur="6.301">Depression if you listen to what the</text>
  <text start="451.909" dur="6.81">government officials say they always</text>
  <text start="455.21" dur="8.069">tell you that things are okay and fine</text>
  <text start="458.719" dur="6.45">in 2008 and 2007 I mean Ben Bernanke was</text>
  <text start="463.279" dur="3.6">not really a government official he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="465.169" dur="6.441">part of a private corporation which is</text>
  <text start="466.879" dur="10.051">the Fed but he is the spokesperson for</text>
  <text start="471.61" dur="8.049">handling a the financial aspect of the</text>
  <text start="476.93" dur="6.029">country and he&amp;#39;s always come out and</text>
  <text start="479.659" dur="6.18">said the subprime has been contained he</text>
  <text start="482.959" dur="5.13">doesn&amp;#39;t forecast the housing market</text>
  <text start="485.839" dur="3.81">declining he only sees it picking up it</text>
  <text start="488.089" dur="5.61">might have slowed a little bit but we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="489.649" dur="7.62">never in India in the history of the US</text>
  <text start="493.699" dur="6.06">seen the housing market crash in the</text>
  <text start="497.269" dur="5.45">same year that we had a recession and</text>
  <text start="499.759" dur="6">the market crashed he came out and said</text>
  <text start="502.719" dur="5.98">right now the Fed is not currently</text>
  <text start="505.759" dur="5.101">forecasting a recession back in the</text>
  <text start="508.699" dur="4.44">Great Depression we had the president</text>
  <text start="510.86" dur="5.219">out there in nineteen thirty or thirty</text>
  <text start="513.139" dur="5.64">one telling the u.s. that they&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="516.079" dur="6.81">road to recovery everything is fine and</text>
  <text start="518.779" dur="9.391">in 1932 there was another big crash</text>
  <text start="522.889" dur="8.371">right now presently we have Obama out in</text>
  <text start="528.17" dur="6.69">the past couple months going around</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="7.92">telling everyone that the housing market</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="6.84">is doing fantastically we have the Fed</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="4.99">telling us that the economy is improving</text>
  <text start="541.7" dur="4.66">unemployment&amp;#39;s going down everything</text>
  <text start="544.17" dur="4.71">looks good and we&amp;#39;re going to begin to</text>
  <text start="546.36" dur="6.33">taper because the economy is on the</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="7.29">verge of recovering and here we are</text>
  <text start="552.69" dur="7.32">again at the same time and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="556.17" dur="7.86">talking about tapering this fall which</text>
  <text start="560.01" dur="6.87">we all know is impossible to do and this</text>
  <text start="564.03" dur="5.94">is why other fed presidents are out</text>
  <text start="566.88" dur="5.94">there telling us that the tapering will</text>
  <text start="569.97" dur="5.58">be painful but it is necessary because</text>
  <text start="572.82" dur="5.16">they understand the whole thing is going</text>
  <text start="575.55" dur="4.5">to come collapsing down anyhow if they</text>
  <text start="577.98" dur="4.83">continually if they continue to print</text>
  <text start="580.05" dur="6.27">and they need to continue to print</text>
  <text start="582.81" dur="8.03">because foreign nations are unloading</text>
  <text start="586.32" dur="8.7">their Treasury bonds housing market is</text>
  <text start="590.84" dur="7.63">declining rapidly and they realize what</text>
  <text start="595.02" dur="11.13">is coming up they realize they will need</text>
  <text start="598.47" dur="13.98">to print more money to handle the amount</text>
  <text start="606.15" dur="9.27">of foreclosures that is going to occur</text>
  <text start="612.45" dur="5.22">when the market starts collapse</text>
  <text start="615.42" dur="7.05">collapsing because we see the real</text>
  <text start="617.67" dur="7.38">estate starting to waver and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="622.47" dur="7.23">seeing that sales now are starting to</text>
  <text start="625.05" dur="6.96">head down and at this point we see that</text>
  <text start="629.7" dur="4.14">there are no other buyers for Treasury</text>
  <text start="632.01" dur="5.07">bonds and they know this and they</text>
  <text start="633.84" dur="6.51">realize that these countries are going</text>
  <text start="637.08" dur="5.82">to start to unload these bonds and they</text>
  <text start="640.35" dur="5.19">got they realize when this fall early</text>
  <text start="642.9" dur="5.52">winter happens they are going to need to</text>
  <text start="645.54" dur="5.52">start purchasing them but how can they</text>
  <text start="648.42" dur="4.47">do this they can&amp;#39;t just say oh the</text>
  <text start="651.06" dur="4.77">economy is getting better and now we</text>
  <text start="652.89" dur="4.92">need to print more money it would make</text>
  <text start="655.83" dur="4.35">no sense so what do they have to do</text>
  <text start="657.81" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re going to have to create some</text>
  <text start="660.18" dur="6">type of an event which allows them to</text>
  <text start="663.18" dur="6.33">look like they are doing this for the</text>
  <text start="666.18" dur="4.95">benefit of the people of the United</text>
  <text start="669.51" dur="2.47">States and we have to remember one</text>
  <text start="671.13" dur="4.6">important thing</text>
  <text start="671.98" dur="7.26">we have to remember that the said is a</text>
  <text start="675.73" dur="7.05">privately owned corporation they&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="679.24" dur="7.17">interests are to themselves and not to</text>
  <text start="682.78" dur="6.75">the people of the United States this is</text>
  <text start="686.41" dur="6.36">where everyone is confused they only</text>
  <text start="689.53" dur="6.54">care about what they are making what</text>
  <text start="692.77" dur="6.57">natural resources they can take over and</text>
  <text start="696.07" dur="6.66">what hard assets they can trade in their</text>
  <text start="699.34" dur="5.82">ridiculous paper money that they print</text>
  <text start="702.73" dur="6.24">out of thin air and what they can</text>
  <text start="705.16" dur="7.62">acquire and keep and this is why they</text>
  <text start="708.97" dur="6.86">pee they don&amp;#39;t want people purchasing</text>
  <text start="712.78" dur="7.02">physical gold and physical silver or</text>
  <text start="715.83" dur="8.98">palladium or platinum and this is why</text>
  <text start="719.8" dur="7.35">when the Fed is Bernanke who was asked</text>
  <text start="724.81" dur="3.69">by Ron Paul you know what is gold you</text>
  <text start="727.15" dur="4.23">know and he he says he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="728.5" dur="5.01">understand it it&amp;#39;s a relic it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="731.38" dur="5.1">old-fashioned piece of metal they</text>
  <text start="733.51" dur="8.37">completely understand what it is they</text>
  <text start="736.48" dur="8.88">understand that that is real money what</text>
  <text start="741.88" dur="7.26">they have is just currency and the US</text>
  <text start="745.36" dur="6.45">dollar used to be you know pegged to</text>
  <text start="749.14" dur="5.43">gold until we came off of the gold</text>
  <text start="751.81" dur="5.76">standard and they realize they need to</text>
  <text start="754.57" dur="7.35">acquire as much of this physical asset</text>
  <text start="757.57" dur="6.3">just like oil natural gas copper lithium</text>
  <text start="761.92" dur="4.29">they need to get this stuff other</text>
  <text start="763.87" dur="6">countries realize this too they that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="766.21" dur="6.27">why China Russia and many other</text>
  <text start="769.87" dur="4.8">countries are purchasing gold the only</text>
  <text start="772.48" dur="4.56">thing I can&amp;#39;t see is the United States</text>
  <text start="774.67" dur="5.85">purchasing any gold they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="777.04" dur="8.67">not purchasing anything so we can see</text>
  <text start="780.52" dur="10.22">where this is headed now I know the BLS</text>
  <text start="785.71" dur="9.84">came out with their jobless claims and</text>
  <text start="790.74" dur="7.69">it seemed like it was really really good</text>
  <text start="795.55" dur="5.04">and unemployment went down but now we</text>
  <text start="798.43" dur="5.97">find out and it seems like they always</text>
  <text start="800.59" dur="4.41">go back and they revise what has</text>
  <text start="804.4" dur="3.68">happened</text>
  <text start="805" dur="8.76">and it seems like for some odd reason</text>
  <text start="808.08" dur="10">there were two states that were having</text>
  <text start="813.76" dur="7.43">computer upgrades and they the the</text>

  <text start="825.73" dur="7.83">that&amp;#39;s why the number that they printed</text>
  <text start="828.58" dur="7.8">was a 292,000 38,000 below expectations</text>
  <text start="833.56" dur="4.86">and you know this is what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="836.38" dur="4.47">and but they&amp;#39;re going to revise it now</text>
  <text start="838.42" dur="3.69">to what it really is so we can</text>
  <text start="840.85" dur="3.06">understand but you know what happens</text>
  <text start="842.11" dur="4.41">they did when they revise it they never</text>
  <text start="843.91" dur="4.62">push the percentage back up all these</text>
  <text start="846.52" dur="4.77">numbers are manipulated all these</text>

  <text start="1112.53" dur="7.11">what is coming is going to be huge just</text>
  <text start="1116.55" dur="5.7">like right before 2008 they did not want</text>
  <text start="1119.64" dur="4.8">to alert people what was really coming</text>
  <text start="1122.25" dur="5.54">that&amp;#39;s why Bernanke was out there saying</text>
  <text start="1124.44" dur="6.63">we are currently not forecasting a</text>

  <text start="1136.47" dur="7.35">not stop and we understand that the debt</text>
  <text start="1140.64" dur="5.46">ceiling debate is coming up which is</text>
  <text start="1143.82" dur="4.41">really not a debate at the show and they</text>
  <text start="1146.1" dur="4.47">were already out there telling you that</text>
  <text start="1148.23" dur="4.98">you know if you know if we have to cut</text>
  <text start="1150.57" dur="3.9">this and cut that and we don&amp;#39;t raise the</text>
  <text start="1153.21" dur="4.05">debt ceiling we&amp;#39;re going to lose</text>
  <text start="1154.47" dur="4.44">hundreds of thousands of jobs and they</text>
  <text start="1157.26" dur="3.81">can&amp;#39;t come to an agreement on the budget</text>
  <text start="1158.91" dur="3.51">and this and that they&amp;#39;re going to raise</text>
  <text start="1161.07" dur="3.3">the debt ceiling I don&amp;#39;t even know why</text>
  <text start="1162.42" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re that this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="1164.37" dur="3.57">ridiculous show I&amp;#39;ve ever seen in my</text>
  <text start="1165.9" dur="6">life I done it 14 times already they</text>
  <text start="1167.94" dur="6.12">have no choice they there are only</text>
  <text start="1171.9" dur="4.17">choices to raise it they know it let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1174.06" dur="5.24">put on a show for the people to make it</text>
  <text start="1176.07" dur="5.67">look like we&amp;#39;re doing something and</text>
  <text start="1179.3" dur="4.84">they&amp;#39;re just going to go ahead and raise</text>
  <text start="1181.74" dur="4.53">it because that&amp;#39;s all there is they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1184.14" dur="4.77">come up with some ridiculous agreement</text>
  <text start="1186.27" dur="4.98">and you&amp;#39;ll see that the debt ceiling now</text>
  <text start="1188.91" dur="3.42">is at 18 trillion or 19 trilliant</text>
  <text start="1191.25" dur="7.85">doesn&amp;#39;t really make a difference at this</text>
  <text start="1192.33" dur="9.78">point now there are senators out there</text>
  <text start="1199.1" dur="5.809">creating a bill which is a media shield</text>
  <text start="1202.11" dur="4.989">and the Senate can</text>
  <text start="1204.909" dur="5.281">he voted 13 to five early Thursday to</text>
  <text start="1207.099" dur="4.741">approve bill s nine eight seven and this</text>
  <text start="1210.19" dur="4.469">bill is meant to protect members of the</text>
  <text start="1211.84" dur="5.25">press from government intrusion and it</text>
  <text start="1214.659" dur="4.98">to maintain the free flow of information</text>
  <text start="1217.09" dur="4.919">to the public and what does this do this</text>
  <text start="1219.639" dur="4.951">legislation in effect says we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1222.009" dur="5.25">to create a legal mechanism to protect</text>
  <text start="1224.59" dur="7.529">anyone who is going to call himself a</text>
  <text start="1227.259" dur="8.34">news person and I think this is headed</text>
  <text start="1232.119" dur="5.76">in the right direction because the news</text>
  <text start="1235.599" dur="4.83">was supposed to keep the government in</text>
  <text start="1237.879" dur="7.081">check but what happened was the</text>
  <text start="1240.429" dur="7.68">corporate owned media was bought out and</text>
  <text start="1244.96" dur="7.469">controlled by the corporations which is</text>
  <text start="1248.109" dur="7.38">controlled by government people so the</text>
  <text start="1252.429" dur="5.7">government control the media and this is</text>
  <text start="1255.489" dur="5.13">why nothing is in check anymore and now</text>
  <text start="1258.129" dur="7.38">we have the alternative media that are</text>
  <text start="1260.619" dur="9.87">calling and looking at news stories in a</text>
  <text start="1265.509" dur="7.38">different way and putting a what facts</text>
  <text start="1270.489" dur="5.55">behind what they&amp;#39;re saying and showing</text>
  <text start="1272.889" dur="5.52">that this is false this is not real take</text>
  <text start="1276.039" dur="3.81">a look over here ask questions because</text>
  <text start="1278.409" dur="3.75">this is what news was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1279.849" dur="4.56">this was you&amp;#39;re supposed to say the news</text>
  <text start="1282.159" dur="4.77">was supposed to do a report and say oh</text>
  <text start="1284.409" dur="4.531">we did some investigating reporting and</text>
  <text start="1286.929" dur="4.68">we found out the government&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="1288.94" dur="5.25">this boom they they&amp;#39;re put in to check</text>
  <text start="1291.609" dur="4.591">but that all went away everything is</text>
  <text start="1294.19" dur="4.169">corrupt now so now you have the free</text>
  <text start="1296.2" dur="5.189">flow of information on the internet with</text>
  <text start="1298.359" dur="6.05">alternative media which the government</text>
  <text start="1301.389" dur="6.66">does not like they&amp;#39;re trying to control</text>

  <text start="1314.32" dur="4.109">don&amp;#39;t have control of is the internet</text>
  <text start="1316.179" dur="3.99">and that is why the president came out</text>
  <text start="1318.429" dur="4.71">with so many different executive orders</text>
  <text start="1320.169" dur="4.71">that is why Mike Rogers has come up with</text>

  <text start="1686.34" dur="9.54">right now and we are going to see new</text>
  <text start="1692.87" dur="5.41">games that they&amp;#39;re going to play and</text>
  <text start="1695.88" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s going to evolve and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1698.28" dur="4.8">to do this quite quickly because they</text>
  <text start="1700.53" dur="5.28">realize what is happening and they lost</text>
  <text start="1703.08" dur="5.37">their edge right now but there is no way</text>
  <text start="1705.81" dur="5.25">that they were going to stop moving</text>
  <text start="1708.45" dur="4.56">forward they know what they have to do</text>
  <text start="1711.06" dur="4.56">they will not stop doing this they</text>
  <text start="1713.01" dur="6.06">realize a collapse is coming and they</text>
  <text start="1715.62" dur="6.78">need to get a war started to cover up</text>
  <text start="1719.07" dur="6.6">this collapse and again when wild</text>
  <text start="1722.4" dur="5.76">animals are put into a corner and back</text>
  <text start="1725.67" dur="5.43">against the wall they become desperate</text>
  <text start="1728.16" dur="6.48">they come out swinging they come out</text>
  <text start="1731.1" dur="6.76">growling and in the next you know a</text>
  <text start="1734.64" dur="4.99">couple weeks a month</text>
  <text start="1737.86" dur="5.73">two months you are going to see</text>
  <text start="1739.63" dur="5.82">something happen that they will have to</text>
  <text start="1743.59" dur="4.62">take to the next level and this is</text>
  <text start="1745.45" dur="8.58">really what I was worried about when I</text>
  <text start="1748.21" dur="9.45">talked in my other episodes that if they</text>
  <text start="1754.03" dur="6.51">cannot get what they want as we&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="1757.66" dur="6.96">seen they wanted to start the war right</text>
  <text start="1760.54" dur="7.25">now they didn&amp;#39;t get what they want they</text>
  <text start="1764.62" dur="7.049">still have the gun legislation pending</text>
  <text start="1767.79" dur="6.91">they still have sista pending they</text>
  <text start="1771.669" dur="5.221">wanted to start the war they can start</text>
  <text start="1774.7" dur="4.05">the war so they&amp;#39;re going to take this</text>
  <text start="1776.89" dur="3.27">and move it up a notch because this is</text>
  <text start="1778.75" dur="5.07">what happens when they don&amp;#39;t get their</text>
  <text start="1780.16" dur="7.17">way and they move the false flags here</text>
  <text start="1783.82" dur="5.34">to the US and then again i&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="1787.33" dur="5.58">since the beginning of since I started</text>
  <text start="1789.16" dur="6.99">this cyber attack is going to be the</text>
  <text start="1792.91" dur="6.78">main doomsday vehicle that they will use</text>
  <text start="1796.15" dur="7.86">at their last-ditch effort to get what</text>
  <text start="1799.69" dur="6.09">they want right now that we are headed</text>
  <text start="1804.01" dur="4.53">in that direction will they try</text>
  <text start="1805.78" dur="5.55">something ahead of this yes they will</text>
  <text start="1808.54" dur="4.879">they might not blame it on Syria but</text>
  <text start="1811.33" dur="4.589">they move they might move it to Iran</text>
  <text start="1813.419" dur="4.39">because right now they&amp;#39;ve tried</text>
  <text start="1815.919" dur="4.591">everything with Syria with the chemical</text>
  <text start="1817.809" dur="5.011">weapons and that didn&amp;#39;t work and Syria</text>
  <text start="1820.51" dur="5.85">right now is agreeing and they are</text>
  <text start="1822.82" dur="7.08">moving towards removing the chemical</text>
  <text start="1826.36" dur="9.449">weapons and we see more propaganda</text>
  <text start="1829.9" dur="9.899">coming out from the house Intel panel we</text>
  <text start="1835.809" dur="8.12">see it from Pataki calling on that Iran</text>
  <text start="1839.799" dur="7.531">could be ramping up cyber attacks and</text>
  <text start="1843.929" dur="5.951">this could be could be hitting the</text>
  <text start="1847.33" dur="7.02">financial systems and they went on to</text>
  <text start="1849.88" dur="7.74">say here that Mike Rogers warned of a</text>
  <text start="1854.35" dur="6.36">threat of a debilitating cyber strike on</text>
  <text start="1857.62" dur="5.73">US financial or other systems we&amp;#39;re not</text>
