  <text start="51.94" dur="7.049">the economy is completely deteriorating</text>
  <text start="56.44" dur="5.43">very very quickly I mean when we look at</text>
  <text start="58.989" dur="6.63">the global consumer confidence models</text>
  <text start="61.87" dur="6.8">we&amp;#39;re seeing that most countries the</text>
  <text start="65.619" dur="7.53">consumer confidence had deteriorated</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="8.04">since July because a lot of people in</text>
  <text start="73.149" dur="7.161">these countries are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="5.56">the system is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="80.31" dur="4.3">they&amp;#39;re looking at Greece they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="105.149" dur="9.521">people are losing work and the system is</text>
  <text start="109.899" dur="6.301">just barely getting by I mean think</text>
  <text start="114.67" dur="4.43">about this for a second and I know I</text>
  <text start="116.2" dur="6.75">mentioned this quite a bit John Kerry</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="7.059">came out with that statement that if</text>
  <text start="122.95" dur="6.15">this Iran nuclear deal doesn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="126.159" dur="5.971">through the dollars going to collapse</text>
  <text start="129.1" dur="7.38">think about that for a second and what</text>
  <text start="132.13" dur="6.6">that means it means that if they cannot</text>
  <text start="136.48" dur="7.17">get into these countries to prop up the</text>
  <text start="138.73" dur="7.41">system and continually push debt get the</text>
  <text start="143.65" dur="7.14">natural natural resources on the dollar</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="9.42">this system is coming down that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="150.79" dur="7.08">this means and of course they know this</text>
  <text start="155.56" dur="4.95">they know this system is falling apart</text>
  <text start="157.87" dur="4.56">this is why they&amp;#39;re going to into each</text>
  <text start="160.51" dur="3.57">one of these countries and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="162.43" dur="4.23">trying to remove</text>
  <text start="164.08" dur="6.27">the elected government they want them</text>
  <text start="166.66" dur="8.09">replaced with a puppet regime to place</text>
  <text start="170.35" dur="7.44">the dollar on the natural resources and</text>
  <text start="174.75" dur="6.49">while all this is happening they are</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="6.3">spying on Americans on foreign</text>
  <text start="181.24" dur="4.65">governments because they need to know</text>
  <text start="184.09" dur="3.66">what everyone is doing and of course</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s many other agendas with this</text>
  <text start="187.75" dur="4.71">when they&amp;#39;re spying of course as we know</text>
  <text start="189.64" dur="6.69">they use it for blackmail they spy on</text>
  <text start="192.46" dur="5.52">congressmen judges and of course what</text>
  <text start="196.33" dur="3.66">they do is they use this information to</text>
  <text start="197.98" dur="5.04">get these people to vote a certain way</text>
  <text start="199.99" dur="7.11">or to rule a certain way and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.02" dur="6.48">finding out that AT&amp;amp;T has played a</text>
  <text start="207.1" dur="7.05">bigger than previously thought role in</text>
  <text start="209.5" dur="9.33">helping the NSA spy on pretty much</text>
  <text start="214.15" dur="7.98">everybody on the internet Edward Snowden</text>
  <text start="218.83" dur="8.94">revealed from his reports from his</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="11.84">leaked documents from 2003 to 2013 that</text>
  <text start="227.77" dur="10.13">yeah AT&amp;amp;T was basically a participant</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="7.03">with the NSA they had a relationship and</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="9.3">the New York Times basically broke the</text>
  <text start="241" dur="10.38">case and AT&amp;amp;T is basically spying on</text>
  <text start="247.2" dur="6.789">billions of emails that landed in the</text>
  <text start="251.38" dur="4.56">domestic networks the documents</text>
  <text start="253.989" dur="3.81">explained that the telecom giant was</text>
  <text start="255.94" dur="3.99">able to deliver under various legal</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="4.351">loopholes international and foreign to</text>
  <text start="259.93" dur="4.05">foreign internet communications even if</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="5.43">they pass through networks located in</text>
  <text start="263.98" dur="7.86">the US now to show how big this network</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="7.8">was and how involved AT&amp;amp;T was the files</text>
  <text start="271.84" dur="7.61">that were released showed that in at</text>
  <text start="275.38" dur="9.44">least 17 of the major US Internet hubs</text>
  <text start="279.45" dur="11.65">surveillance equipment was set up and it</text>
  <text start="284.82" dur="8.02">it&amp;#39;s larger than what Verizon did so</text>
  <text start="291.1" dur="4.08">this is a very big deal and this is why</text>
  <text start="292.84" dur="4.92">each and every one of us needs to</text>
  <text start="295.18" dur="4.58">protect our information</text>
  <text start="297.76" dur="6.06">think about this they set this up</text>
  <text start="299.76" dur="7.57">they&amp;#39;re intercepting information this is</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="7.47">why encryption is so important to keep</text>
  <text start="307.33" dur="6.33">your private information private so even</text>
  <text start="311.29" dur="6">if they did pick it up they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="313.66" dur="6.09">read it this is why you need to use like</text>
  <text start="317.29" dur="4.95">start page which is a search type of</text>
  <text start="319.75" dur="6.21">page which allows you to basically</text>
  <text start="322.24" dur="5.46">search anonymously you can use proxy</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="5.55">servers to make it seem like your</text>
  <text start="327.7" dur="8.58">location is from someplace else you can</text>
  <text start="331.51" dur="6.72">use a sleeve to put your phone into to</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="4.41">stop them from tracking you there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="338.23" dur="5.13">from plot coat pocket calm which has</text>
  <text start="340.69" dur="5.31">different types of metals silver copper</text>
  <text start="343.36" dur="4.74">all interwoven into a fabric it blocks</text>
  <text start="346" dur="3.93">the signal actually it has an additional</text>
  <text start="348.1" dur="3.3">health benefit of blocks the radiation</text>
  <text start="349.93" dur="3.12">when you&amp;#39;re talking on your phone but</text>
  <text start="351.4" dur="4.68">they also make these sleeves to block</text>
  <text start="353.05" dur="4.38">your signal from your credit card so if</text>
  <text start="356.08" dur="3.27">somebody is walking by they can&amp;#39;t steal</text>
  <text start="357.43" dur="3.89">your information they also make it for</text>
  <text start="359.35" dur="6.09">your driver&amp;#39;s license because as we know</text>
  <text start="361.32" dur="6.91">coming up very soon DHS wants all states</text>
  <text start="365.44" dur="5.46">to comply with the new Real ID driver&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.23" dur="6.06">license which basically has an RFID chip</text>
  <text start="370.9" dur="5.43">it has a bar code on it it has all your</text>
  <text start="374.29" dur="5.19">information which is then uploaded to a</text>
  <text start="376.33" dur="5.46">central database putting this into the</text>
  <text start="379.48" dur="5.64">sleeves blocks the signal so they can</text>
  <text start="381.79" dur="5.63">track you and everyone needs to start</text>
  <text start="385.12" dur="5.99">doing this on their own because again</text>
  <text start="387.42" dur="7.45">the Constitution the Bill of Rights</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="5.38">allows us to be private without the</text>
  <text start="394.87" dur="4.08">government spy house this is why we have</text>
  <text start="396.49" dur="4.86">the Fourth Amendment because the</text>
  <text start="398.95" dur="5.16">government has to prove why they need</text>
  <text start="401.35" dur="5.73">the information and of course as we know</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="5.88">the USA Freedom Act allows all the</text>
  <text start="407.08" dur="5.76">companies to pass this information along</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="5.43">to the government and this is why they</text>
  <text start="412.84" dur="5.46">want to pass sissa because it will not</text>
  <text start="415.42" dur="7.23">hold the company&amp;#39;s liable it&amp;#39;s a perfect</text>
  <text start="418.3" dur="7.11">match this is what they want now out in</text>
  <text start="422.65" dur="7.14">Ukraine we see things really starting to</text>
  <text start="425.41" dur="5.91">heat up we see Ukraine right now is</text>
  <text start="429.79" dur="4.05">pushing prop</text>
  <text start="431.32" dur="4.77">out there that there are Russian troops</text>
  <text start="433.84" dur="5.19">in Ukraine and the new number that has</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="6.06">come out is about 50,000 troops that are</text>
  <text start="439.03" dur="5.64">intermixed into the troops of you of the</text>
  <text start="442.15" dur="4.14">southeastern people now of course we</text>
  <text start="444.67" dur="5.25">heard numbers like a hundred thousand we</text>
  <text start="446.29" dur="6.15">are numbers like 9000 they have 10,000</text>
  <text start="449.92" dur="6.03">tanks you know I mean 500 tanks all</text>
  <text start="452.44" dur="7.14">these different types of military assets</text>
  <text start="455.95" dur="5.88">and so far we have seen nothing at all</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="4.68">of course all the satellite imagery that</text>
  <text start="461.83" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re producing doesn&amp;#39;t show anything</text>
  <text start="464.26" dur="3.78">or they just don&amp;#39;t have the satellite</text>
  <text start="465.88" dur="5.34">imagery so really there&amp;#39;s no proof that</text>
  <text start="468.04" dur="5.4">comes along with this whatsoever but</text>
  <text start="471.22" dur="4.95">Kiev is out there and we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="4.11">getting ready for a major offensive</text>
  <text start="476.17" dur="4.83">because all of a sudden they came out</text>
  <text start="477.55" dur="6.48">and said listen all that equipment that</text>
  <text start="481" dur="5.16">we withdrew we can bring it right back</text>
  <text start="484.03" dur="4.56">up to the contact line which they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="486.16" dur="4.29">done in many cases because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.59" dur="4.41">saying if they&amp;#39;re under threat we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="490.45" dur="4.11">going to bring our military assets right</text>
  <text start="493" dur="4.2">back to the contact line right to the</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="5.61">front line and they&amp;#39;re saying they</text>
  <text start="497.2" dur="5.46">fulfilled the Minsk agreements it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="500.17" dur="3.99">southeastern people who are not and it</text>
  <text start="502.66" dur="3.57">looks like the southeastern people are</text>
  <text start="504.16" dur="3.15">causing problems and violating the</text>
  <text start="506.23" dur="4.98">agreements so they&amp;#39;re already starting</text>
  <text start="507.31" dur="5.7">with the propaganda and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="511.21" dur="4.1">to see that they&amp;#39;re pushing this</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="5.339">propaganda to get something started</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="7.06">right now Kiev has their forces on high</text>
  <text start="518.349" dur="7.021">alert hi combat alert and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="522.37" dur="5.28">looking to provoke the south eastern</text>
  <text start="525.37" dur="5.73">people they&amp;#39;re continually doing this by</text>
  <text start="527.65" dur="5.46">shelling them and it will not end and it</text>
  <text start="531.1" dur="5.43">seems like every single day they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="533.11" dur="8.01">pushing a little bit more because they</text>
  <text start="536.53" dur="6.78">need to get this war started libya right</text>

  <text start="626.47" dur="5.489">apart right now with the buffer zone so</text>
  <text start="629.439" dur="5.19">they can bring in ground troops to show</text>
  <text start="631.959" dur="4.62">that this is not part of Syria anymore</text>
  <text start="634.629" dur="6.241">basically what&amp;#39;s happening in these</text>

  <text start="654.189" dur="4.65">currency they&amp;#39;re going to be using the</text>

  <text start="710.38" dur="5.69">Russia so he&amp;#39;s trying to broker a deal</text>
  <text start="712.81" dur="7.65">broker a deal with Saudi Arabia and</text>
  <text start="716.07" dur="7.15">other countries to say listen we can</text>
  <text start="720.46" dur="6.21">work something out here and he</text>
  <text start="723.22" dur="8.37">understands he does not want a divided</text>
  <text start="726.67" dur="8.19">Syria now the only sticking point that</text>
  <text start="731.59" dur="7.25">is left is Assad what did they do with</text>
  <text start="734.86" dur="6.84">him and Assad is an ally to Putin and</text>
  <text start="738.84" dur="6.13">Putin is resisting this outcome for many</text>
  <text start="741.7" dur="6.72">reasons first he doesn&amp;#39;t see he first he</text>
  <text start="744.97" dur="6.27">doesn&amp;#39;t want to be 12 up a tray Assad</text>
  <text start="748.42" dur="4.86">right now because he is an ally it will</text>
  <text start="751.24" dur="5.34">hurt his reputation if he does do this</text>
  <text start="753.28" dur="6.24">and basically he can&amp;#39;t allowed himself</text>
  <text start="756.58" dur="7.58">to comply with a regime change doctrine</text>
  <text start="759.52" dur="7.59">because that&amp;#39;s against international law</text>
  <text start="764.16" dur="4.81">Putin wants to preserve the government</text>
  <text start="767.11" dur="4.38">institutions including the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="768.97" dur="7.38">to avoid another Iraq because he knows</text>
  <text start="771.49" dur="8.01">what will happen there so right now what</text>
  <text start="776.35" dur="6.24">he&amp;#39;s trying to do is he&amp;#39;s trying to have</text>
  <text start="779.5" dur="5.85">both sides agree on something in the</text>
  <text start="782.59" dur="4.98">middle but of course the United States</text>
  <text start="785.35" dur="3.66">government central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="787.57" dur="2.82">want this they want in the whole country</text>
  <text start="789.01" dur="4.46">you have to understand the central</text>
  <text start="790.39" dur="6.45">bankers they don&amp;#39;t want bits and pieces</text>
  <text start="793.47" dur="6.13">they want to control the entire country</text>
  <text start="796.84" dur="4.41">they want the port they want all the</text>
  <text start="799.6" dur="3.21">land in between they want the natural</text>
  <text start="801.25" dur="5.85">resources they want to run the pipeline</text>
  <text start="802.81" dur="8.48">through and this is the main problem but</text>
  <text start="807.1" dur="7.71">he&amp;#39;s trying to calm the situation down</text>
  <text start="811.29" dur="6.87">so right now the only glitch to the plan</text>
  <text start="814.81" dur="7.44">is that Putin must move very fast</text>
  <text start="818.16" dur="7.63">because Washington is getting ready for</text>
  <text start="822.25" dur="6.44">war turkey already has tanks loaded with</text>
  <text start="825.79" dur="6.35">troops they&amp;#39;ve already been trained</text>
  <text start="828.69" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re crossing into Syria right now</text>
  <text start="832.14" dur="5.99">and they&amp;#39;re expected to clear and</text>
  <text start="834.69" dur="6.42">capture territories within Syria and</text>
  <text start="838.13" dur="5.32">Putin knows it&amp;#39;s a matter of time before</text>
  <text start="841.11" dur="6.24">this thing goes full scale this is what</text>
  <text start="843.45" dur="7.86">he stopped back in 2013 and this is why</text>
  <text start="847.35" dur="7.74">we see this huge ramp up and we see</text>
  <text start="851.31" dur="6.99">right now that Syria is saying that they</text>
  <text start="855.09" dur="6.96">will not bargain on any of this Assad is</text>
  <text start="858.3" dur="6.18">not stepping down and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.05" dur="3.84">going to see something even bigger occur</text>
  <text start="864.48" dur="3.2">coming down the line because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="865.89" dur="3.87">preparing for war just like in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="867.68" dur="4.54">we can see it all happening right in</text>
  <text start="869.76" dur="6.39">front of us and we have to remember we</text>
  <text start="872.22" dur="6.12">this whole thing is going to be a</text>
  <text start="876.15" dur="3.51">complete disaster this will start World</text>
  <text start="878.34" dur="4.35">War three one way or another because</text>
  <text start="879.66" dur="6.48">Russia will be sucked into it China will</text>
  <text start="882.69" dur="5.91">be sucked into it and again Russia and</text>
  <text start="886.14" dur="5.94">China they&amp;#39;re not Yemen they&amp;#39;re not Iraq</text>
  <text start="888.6" dur="5.91">these are advanced nations with weapons</text>
  <text start="892.08" dur="5.25">equal or better than the United States</text>
  <text start="894.51" dur="6">actually the last training of the f-35</text>
  <text start="897.33" dur="8.28">when they pitted against the f16 and it</text>
  <text start="900.51" dur="8.97">lost remember the f16 is almost like the</text>
  <text start="905.61" dur="8.07">russian-made mig-29 and the su-27</text>
  <text start="909.48" dur="8.82">flanker and the f-35 couldn&amp;#39;t beat the</text>
  <text start="913.68" dur="10.25">f16 in a dogfight this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="918.3" dur="8.49">problem and we know the f-35 is</text>
  <text start="923.93" dur="7.3">basically a lemon it&amp;#39;s a lot of money</text>
  <text start="926.79" dur="6.57">but it&amp;#39;s a complete lemon and we</text>
  <text start="931.23" dur="5.13">understand Russia and China they have</text>
  <text start="933.36" dur="5.04">nuclear weapons this is not going to be</text>
  <text start="936.36" dur="5.04">oh let&amp;#39;s send a couple troops in there</text>
  <text start="938.4" dur="6.93">it&amp;#39;s all going to be over in a day this</text>
  <text start="941.4" dur="5.01">will go nuclear eventually and again you</text>
  <text start="945.33" dur="2.61">have to remember the United States</text>
  <text start="946.41" dur="5.1">government central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="947.94" dur="5.61">care they&amp;#39;re prepared in their bunkers</text>
  <text start="951.51" dur="5.04">they realized the system&amp;#39;s dying John</text>
  <text start="953.55" dur="6.69">Kerry already told us he let it slip out</text>
  <text start="956.55" dur="5.4">and we can see from all the economic</text>
  <text start="960.24" dur="4.68">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at it</text>
  <text start="961.95" dur="3.72">is falling apart they can&amp;#39;t stop it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="964.92" dur="3.84">accelerate</text>
  <text start="965.67" dur="8.13">eating and this is why there&amp;#39;s this big</text>
  <text start="968.76" dur="6.95">push for war right now this is why</text>
  <text start="973.8" dur="4.95">everyone needs to be prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="975.71" dur="5.74">just like with the people in Greece they</text>
  <text start="978.75" dur="5.72">were prepared and ready we need to be</text>
  <text start="981.45" dur="6.53">prepared and ready and yes this entire</text>
  <text start="984.47" dur="6.43">system will come down one way or another</text>
  <text start="987.98" dur="4.6">it&amp;#39;s either going to be controlled by</text>
  <text start="990.9" dur="3.18">the central bankers the way they want it</text>
  <text start="992.58" dur="4.11">or there&amp;#39;s going to be some type of</text>
  <text start="994.08" dur="4.32">Black Swan which will trigger a complete</text>
