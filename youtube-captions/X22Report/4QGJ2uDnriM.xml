  <text start="120.01" dur="5.34">next phase is coming what do we see</text>
  <text start="122.86" dur="6.42">happening really think about it for a</text>
  <text start="125.35" dur="6.389">sec here Trump in the Patriots they have</text>
  <text start="129.28" dur="7.53">taken this economy and they have taken</text>
  <text start="131.739" dur="6.631">full control during the election Hillary</text>
  <text start="136.81" dur="5.759">Clinton was out there saying if Trump</text>
  <text start="138.37" dur="7.979">puts his policies forward jobs will be</text>
  <text start="142.569" dur="6.81">lost the economy will crash Obama said</text>
  <text start="146.349" dur="5.791">it&amp;#39;s impossible to bring back jobs it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.379" dur="6.36">impossible to do what he wants to do</text>
  <text start="152.14" dur="7.28">he&amp;#39;d have to have a magic wand all that</text>
  <text start="155.739" dur="8.721">has turned out to be false</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="10.38">why why has that all turned out to be</text>
  <text start="164.46" dur="10.23">false because the plan that the central</text>
  <text start="169.8" dur="7.83">bank the deep state had failed why did</text>
  <text start="174.69" dur="8.21">it fail because Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="10.02">took control of the economy they were</text>
  <text start="182.9" dur="6.66">able to out maneuver what the central</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="5.19">bank what the deep state was planning</text>
  <text start="189.56" dur="5.85">yes they were planning for the economy</text>
  <text start="192.84" dur="7.89">to fail yes they were planning for</text>
  <text start="195.41" dur="7.48">millions of jobs to be lost yes the only</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="4.32">way to get around this was to have a</text>
  <text start="202.89" dur="7.08">magic wand and Trump didn&amp;#39;t have it at</text>
  <text start="205.05" dur="8.12">the time they did Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="209.97" dur="6.93">they came in and they took full control</text>
  <text start="213.17" dur="5.95">it took him some time but as we can see</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="7.26">the plan now is moving forward what</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="7.04">happened well in 2019 all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="7.19">the central bank stopped raising rates</text>
  <text start="226.16" dur="7.75">they started to cut rates out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="4.84">why would they do this unemployment was</text>
  <text start="233.91" dur="4.68">going down the market was going up GDP</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="4.98">numbers look fantastic why in the world</text>
  <text start="238.59" dur="4.679">would they do this it made no sense</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="4.289">actually the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="243.269" dur="4.861">financial financial pundits they had no</text>
  <text start="245.459" dur="5.851">clue on what was going on it didn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="248.13" dur="6.9">sense because if the economy is strong</text>
  <text start="251.31" dur="6">and robust you raise the rates but Trump</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="4.829">the Patriots they knew if they continued</text>
  <text start="257.31" dur="4.649">to raise the rates it would implode the</text>
  <text start="259.859" dur="5.131">economy this is exactly what they wanted</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="7.231">to do they wanted the entire economic</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="6.81">system to implode this way they can get</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="3.63">rid of Trump they can say look what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="4.56">done to the economy</text>
  <text start="272.82" dur="5.64">you lost millions of jobs this is why</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="5.52">Nancy Pelosi doesn&amp;#39;t want to pass the</text>
  <text start="278.46" dur="7.26">u.s. MCA because she knows if she passes</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="6.39">it now during this period of time up to</text>
  <text start="285.72" dur="5.31">the elections more and more jobs would</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="4.19">be created and this would hurt their</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="4.22">chances</text>
  <text start="292.46" dur="5.04">are they doing what they need to do to</text>
  <text start="295.25" dur="4.56">benefit the people and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="297.5" dur="5.61">the deep state the Dems the central bank</text>
  <text start="299.81" dur="7.26">know they&amp;#39;re doing things to benefit</text>
  <text start="303.11" dur="6.17">themselves and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="307.07" dur="5.129">market when we look at what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="309.28" dur="4.24">it&amp;#39;s going according to plan we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="312.199" dur="3.601">a little bit more about this in a bit</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="5.79">but first let&amp;#39;s talk about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="7.53">happening with Boris Johnson the UK now</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="6.8">Johnson he&amp;#39;s saying listen we might be</text>
  <text start="323.33" dur="7.02">able to get the brexit before Christmas</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="5.619">he&amp;#39;s also pledging no new taxes and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.35" dur="4.129">letting everyone know he&amp;#39;s doing the</text>
  <text start="331.729" dur="5.041">opposite of what the Labour Party wants</text>
  <text start="334.479" dur="4.931">he promised a total of twenty three</text>
  <text start="336.77" dur="5.429">point five billion pounds or 1/3 thirty</text>
  <text start="339.41" dur="7.22">point two billion in sensible tax cuts</text>
  <text start="342.199" dur="6.391">and day to day spending over four years</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="4.53">including on the National Health Service</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="6.389">which would gain fifty thousand nurses</text>
  <text start="351.16" dur="9.689">he also ruled out seeking any further</text>
  <text start="354.979" dur="9.781">delay to the brexit Boris Johnson is</text>
  <text start="360.849" dur="6.011">committed to doing what he said he was</text>
  <text start="364.76" dur="5.01">going to do now yes there are forces</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="4.799">that are working against him just like</text>
  <text start="369.77" dur="3.54">the forces are working against Trump but</text>
  <text start="371.659" dur="4.561">if you look what at what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="373.31" dur="6.419">here he&amp;#39;s really doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="376.22" dur="6.93">that Trump is doing cutting taxes giving</text>
  <text start="379.729" dur="5.791">the power back to the people and moving</text>
  <text start="383.15" dur="4.829">forward and yes there are many obstacles</text>
  <text start="385.52" dur="3.769">that he has to get around here in the</text>
  <text start="387.979" dur="5.341">United States but we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="389.289" dur="6.731">how the plan is moving forward Trump</text>
  <text start="393.32" dur="6.3">tweeted out another new stock market</text>
  <text start="396.02" dur="6.179">record enjoy now when we look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.62" dur="7.47">been happening here we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="402.199" dur="8.46">Down Nasdaq sp500 they have closed at</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="6.93">record highs think about what we were</text>
  <text start="410.659" dur="7.561">talking about before if the Fed cuts</text>
  <text start="414.02" dur="7.619">rates if the Fed starts stimulus what</text>
  <text start="418.22" dur="4.919">will happen to the markets they will</text>
  <text start="421.639" dur="5.131">rise</text>
  <text start="423.139" dur="7.861">what will happen to unemployment it will</text>
  <text start="426.77" dur="9.06">decrease what will happen to GDP it will</text>
  <text start="431" dur="7.669">increase this is exactly what the</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="6.51">Patriots want this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="438.669" dur="5.65">now once again this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="442.34" dur="6.18">with making the central bank system</text>
  <text start="444.319" dur="8.671">great again this is about destroying the</text>
  <text start="448.52" dur="8.73">central bank system and using it to what</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="9.979">they need it for they need it to get</text>
  <text start="457.25" dur="8.849">elected in 2020 this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="462.969" dur="7.961">you need to use the tools that you have</text>
  <text start="466.099" dur="9.151">now if Trump decided a year ago two</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="7.4">years ago to change the economy to say</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="5.909">you know something we are in an</text>
  <text start="478.33" dur="6.28">illusionary economy and what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="481.159" dur="5.701">to do today is we&amp;#39;re going to change it</text>
  <text start="484.61" dur="3.6">and I&amp;#39;m going to be calling out the Fed</text>
  <text start="486.86" dur="3.869">what do you think would have happened at</text>
  <text start="488.21" dur="5.15">this point they would have crashed the</text>
  <text start="490.729" dur="6.09">economy they would have blamed Trump</text>
  <text start="493.36" dur="5.44">remember just because you want to do</text>
  <text start="496.819" dur="3.931">something doesn&amp;#39;t mean just you just can</text>
  <text start="498.8" dur="6.359">come out and do it there are other</text>
  <text start="500.75" dur="8.099">forces at play and you need to remove</text>
  <text start="505.159" dur="6.421">these forces to enable you to move</text>
  <text start="508.849" dur="4.411">forward this is what Trump and the</text>
  <text start="511.58" dur="5.819">Patriots have been doing and it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="6.36">slow process the swamp is deep wide and</text>
  <text start="517.399" dur="4.56">it goes into many different departments</text>
  <text start="519.62" dur="7.89">in the government to the central bank</text>
  <text start="521.959" dur="7.201">and remember this entire plan Trump and</text>
  <text start="527.51" dur="3.18">the Patriots they need to get through</text>
  <text start="529.16" dur="4.59">the blockers it&amp;#39;s almost like a football</text>
  <text start="530.69" dur="4.889">team where you have the offensive line</text>
  <text start="533.75" dur="4.199">and the quarterback is behind the</text>
  <text start="535.579" dur="6.211">offensive line Trump needs to get</text>
  <text start="537.949" dur="5.76">through all of those players to get to</text>
  <text start="541.79" dur="4.739">that quarterback which is the central</text>
  <text start="543.709" dur="6.831">bank and this is why Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="546.529" dur="6.481">are taking it slow step by step and</text>
  <text start="550.54" dur="5.26">think about how much more they have to</text>
  <text start="553.01" dur="3.78">do now Moody&amp;#39;s is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.8" dur="3.24">saying that global</text>
  <text start="556.79" dur="4.68">credit conditions in 2020 will weaken as</text>
  <text start="559.04" dur="5.19">a result of growing risks of an economic</text>
  <text start="561.47" dur="5.1">downturn trade policy uncertainty and</text>
  <text start="564.23" dur="3.74">the effects of unpredictable political</text>
  <text start="566.57" dur="4.8">and geopolitical environment</text>
  <text start="567.97" dur="5.01">Moody&amp;#39;s does not expect a recession in</text>
  <text start="571.37" dur="5">2020</text>
  <text start="572.98" dur="7.15">even though recession risks are building</text>
  <text start="576.37" dur="7.59">now once again the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="580.13" dur="6.75">financial pun ins the rating agencies</text>
  <text start="583.96" dur="5.41">one minute they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="586.88" dur="4.11">to be recession the next minute they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="589.37" dur="4.53">saying well the indicators don&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="590.99" dur="6.18">that bad anymore they&amp;#39;re all confused</text>
  <text start="593.9" dur="5.01">they don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on how</text>
  <text start="597.17" dur="3.96">could this be one minute that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="2.82">talking about the entire systems gonna</text>
  <text start="601.13" dur="2.1">collapse</text>
  <text start="601.73" dur="3.45">the next minute they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="603.23" dur="7.43">everything doesn&amp;#39;t look as bad as they</text>
  <text start="605.18" dur="8.61">thought it did in a manipulated economy</text>
  <text start="610.66" dur="6.46">you can change the direction of the</text>
  <text start="613.79" dur="7.02">economy on a dime isn&amp;#39;t this what Trump</text>
  <text start="617.12" dur="6.54">and the Patriots have done one minute we</text>
  <text start="620.81" dur="4.59">were heading towards a recession the</text>
  <text start="623.66" dur="3.84">next minute Trump says you know</text>
  <text start="625.4" dur="4.23">something I want the Fed to cut rates</text>
  <text start="627.5" dur="4.77">and I want stimulus boom</text>
  <text start="629.63" dur="4.68">the entire thing just turned around you</text>
  <text start="632.27" dur="4.17">can manipulate the numbers you can</text>
  <text start="634.31" dur="3.81">manipulate the market you can manipulate</text>
  <text start="636.44" dur="5.25">the unemployment numbers you can</text>
  <text start="638.12" dur="6.15">manipulate it all this is why the</text>
  <text start="641.69" dur="5.55">financial puns the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="644.27" dur="7.5">rating agencies they never had any clue</text>
  <text start="647.24" dur="10.14">what was going on what we know is that</text>
  <text start="651.77" dur="7.14">the central bank today controls how the</text>
  <text start="657.38" dur="5.03">economy works</text>
  <text start="658.91" dur="7.41">Trump is controlling the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="662.41" dur="8.47">which means he understands how the</text>
  <text start="666.32" dur="6.57">system works and if he understands how</text>
  <text start="670.88" dur="4.32">the system works he can make it do</text>
  <text start="672.89" dur="3.12">whatever he wants and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="675.2" dur="3.96">what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="676.01" dur="4.29">now when the Fed cuts rates again even</text>
  <text start="679.16" dur="2.97">though the mainstream media is out there</text>
  <text start="680.3" dur="2.48">saying no we&amp;#39;re not cutting rates</text>
  <text start="682.13" dur="5.64">anymore</text>
  <text start="682.78" dur="6.79">if the Fed cuts rates again and pushes</text>
  <text start="687.77" dur="3.059">more stimulus I know the repo markets</text>
  <text start="689.57" dur="3.419">going crazy</text>
  <text start="690.829" dur="5.04">what we&amp;#39;re going to see is the market</text>
  <text start="692.989" dur="6.121">move up even further we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="695.869" dur="6.421">unemployment decline GP numbers move up</text>
  <text start="699.11" dur="7.169">if trump implements another tax cut or</text>
  <text start="702.29" dur="8.13">mentions a tax cut in 2020 or at the end</text>
  <text start="706.279" dur="7.23">of 2019 you&amp;#39;re going to see the GDP</text>
  <text start="710.42" dur="5.339">numbers increase which means people feel</text>
