  <text start="82.31" dur="6.57">financial news now the central banks</text>
  <text start="85.79" dur="8.039">they are starting to realize that they</text>
  <text start="88.88" dur="8.22">lost complete control of everything and</text>
  <text start="93.829" dur="5.491">I don&amp;#39;t mean where the central bank has</text>
  <text start="97.1" dur="4.829">the ability to make the economy crash or</text>
  <text start="99.32" dur="4.799">do well or anything like that when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="101.929" dur="4.98">talking about I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="104.119" dur="6.21">central bank where they used to have</text>
  <text start="106.909" dur="6">control over politicians they used to</text>
  <text start="110.329" dur="5.341">have control over the narrative they</text>
  <text start="112.909" dur="4.441">have lost that now now of course the</text>
  <text start="115.67" dur="3.75">central bank doesn&amp;#39;t want you to know</text>
  <text start="117.35" dur="4.049">this they&amp;#39;re trying to make everyone</text>
  <text start="119.42" dur="5.659">believe that they still control the</text>
  <text start="121.399" dur="7.291">narrative that they&amp;#39;re independent but</text>
  <text start="125.079" dur="6.731">they lost this control just like the</text>
  <text start="128.69" dur="7.08">deep state the mainstream media just</text>
  <text start="131.81" dur="6.6">like they&amp;#39;re losing control and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="135.77" dur="6.84">a reason for this this was part of the</text>
  <text start="138.41" dur="7.11">plan to take the narrative away from the</text>
  <text start="142.61" dur="5.34">central bank for Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="145.52" dur="4.549">to call the shots think about what is</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="5.22">happening right now with the economy</text>
  <text start="150.069" dur="5.561">when we go back in time the Federal</text>
  <text start="153.17" dur="2.85">Reserve would dictate what was going to</text>
  <text start="155.63" dur="3.84">happen</text>
  <text start="156.02" dur="5.88">remember when Bernanke was out there he</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="4.859">was out there telling you what</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="4.5">economy was going to do same thing with</text>
  <text start="164.329" dur="3.511">Greenspan and all the rest and during</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="3.27">that period of time where the Fed was</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="6.709">telling you what was going to happen</text>
  <text start="169.67" dur="8.399">the president was in line with the Fed</text>
  <text start="174.549" dur="6.821">they both told you that this is how the</text>
  <text start="178.069" dur="8.551">economy is going to go today what do we</text>
  <text start="181.37" dur="11.069">see we see the complete opposite Trump</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="11.31">is dictating to the Fed telling the Fed</text>
  <text start="192.439" dur="7.321">this is what I want the feds not coming</text>
  <text start="197.93" dur="4.889">out saying listen this is how the</text>
  <text start="199.76" dur="6.569">economy is gonna go this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.819" dur="8.73">going to do next if you notice the Fed</text>
  <text start="206.329" dur="7.951">is trailing behind Trump Trump is saying</text>
  <text start="211.549" dur="6">okay look I&amp;#39;m looking all the other</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="6.06">countries I see what they&amp;#39;re doing their</text>
  <text start="217.549" dur="5.101">central bank systems they have interest</text>
  <text start="220.34" dur="6.39">rates at zero or negative they started</text>
  <text start="222.65" dur="6.809">stimulus the Fed is not saying okay</text>
  <text start="226.73" dur="5.27">we&amp;#39;re gonna follow the Fed is listening</text>
  <text start="229.459" dur="6.12">to trump and then doing what he wants</text>
  <text start="232" dur="5.56">remember the Fed before this was out</text>
  <text start="235.579" dur="3.961">they&amp;#39;re calling the shots they were out</text>
  <text start="237.56" dur="4.139">there saying nope we&amp;#39;re going to unload</text>
  <text start="239.54" dur="5.789">our balance sheet nope we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="241.699" dur="6.12">raise interest rates that all changed</text>
  <text start="245.329" dur="5.13">they had the narrative they lost the</text>
  <text start="247.819" dur="3.931">narrative they can&amp;#39;t get it back I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="250.459" dur="5.43">discussing this a little bit later in</text>
  <text start="251.75" dur="6.62">this report but first Boris Johnson he</text>
  <text start="255.889" dur="5.4">is in New York at the UN meeting and</text>
  <text start="258.37" dur="5.829">he&amp;#39;s telling everyone in Britain not to</text>
  <text start="261.289" dur="5.611">expect a breakthrough on the brexit</text>
  <text start="264.199" dur="5.4">because he&amp;#39;s going to speak with EU</text>
  <text start="266.9" dur="4.92">leaders at the UN he doesn&amp;#39;t expect</text>
  <text start="269.599" dur="4.621">anything to come out of it now of course</text>
  <text start="271.82" dur="4.23">the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="274.22" dur="3.78">make a big deal maybe Boris Johnson will</text>
  <text start="276.05" dur="4.67">make this deal maybe something will</text>
  <text start="278" dur="6.36">happen nothing&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="280.72" dur="8.83">Boris Johnson is on his own trajectory</text>
  <text start="284.36" dur="8.91">he is going to push the brexit hard he</text>
  <text start="289.55" dur="5.94">wants the brexit October 31st with a No</text>
  <text start="293.27" dur="4.679">Deal and I do believe</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="7.649">he&amp;#39;s going to do everything in his power</text>
  <text start="297.949" dur="8.041">to reach that date and have a no deal</text>
  <text start="303.139" dur="5.191">brexit now of course as we know the EU</text>
  <text start="305.99" dur="3.75">is going to try to stop this any way</text>
  <text start="308.33" dur="5.01">they possibly can the central bank</text>
  <text start="309.74" dur="6.329">system will not allow this to happen the</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="5.609">deep state the elites they will not</text>
  <text start="316.069" dur="5.301">allow this to happen and you can expect</text>
  <text start="318.949" dur="5.28">as we get closer and closer to this date</text>
  <text start="321.37" dur="5.049">you&amp;#39;re gonna see them pull rabbits out</text>
  <text start="324.229" dur="4.56">of their hats you&amp;#39;re gonna see fear</text>
  <text start="326.419" dur="6.09">mongering you&amp;#39;re going to see everything</text>
  <text start="328.789" dur="5.521">that you would expect to see as we get</text>
  <text start="332.509" dur="4.5">closer and closer to this date because</text>
  <text start="334.31" dur="5.31">they are going to try to scare the</text>
  <text start="337.009" dur="4.291">population this is what the central bank</text>
  <text start="339.62" dur="5.25">this is what the elite the deep state do</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="6.859">the mainstream media they push fear and</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="6.419">they use it as their weapon and</text>
  <text start="348.159" dur="5.471">hopefully that people say okay we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="351.289" dur="4.47">want that to happen okay we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="4.23">power outages okay we don&amp;#39;t want our</text>
  <text start="355.759" dur="6.571">economic system to fall apart okay we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="8.94">do what you say but again this type of</text>
  <text start="362.33" dur="6.329">narrative is continually failing think</text>
  <text start="366.8" dur="4.95">about what the central bank here in the</text>
  <text start="368.659" dur="4.56">United States is doing they kept on</text>
  <text start="371.75" dur="3.24">saying and this is along with the</text>
  <text start="373.219" dur="5.401">mainstream media that we have a</text>
  <text start="374.99" dur="4.799">recession coming all the indicators are</text>
  <text start="378.62" dur="3.329">pointing to a recession</text>
  <text start="379.789" dur="5.37">if Trump lowers the interest rates</text>
  <text start="381.949" dur="5.731">that&amp;#39;s gonna kick off every session why</text>
  <text start="385.159" dur="4.56">because every time the Fed lowers the</text>
  <text start="387.68" dur="4.5">rates our recession comes now think</text>
  <text start="389.719" dur="4.891">about what they&amp;#39;re doing here we know</text>
  <text start="392.18" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s not when they lower the rates it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.61" dur="5.97">when they raise the rates they tip the</text>
  <text start="397.46" dur="5.519">entire system over the edge and then</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="4.23">they quickly lower the rates but they</text>
  <text start="402.979" dur="4.581">don&amp;#39;t want people to understand and</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="6.06">realize that when you lower the rates</text>
  <text start="407.56" dur="5.669">the economy takes off this is why</text>
  <text start="410.87" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;ve been telling this story because</text>
  <text start="413.229" dur="5.111">everyone&amp;#39;s going to start to realize</text>
  <text start="415.13" dur="6.87">very very soon that as the rates are</text>
  <text start="418.34" dur="7.859">continually lowered and stimulus comes</text>
  <text start="422" dur="5.7">back online the economy is going to look</text>
  <text start="426.199" dur="3.691">fantastic</text>
  <text start="427.7" dur="4.23">now Dudley is out there and this is the</text>
  <text start="429.89" dur="5.31">former New York Fed president William</text>
  <text start="431.93" dur="5.01">Dudley he&amp;#39;s the one that said hey we</text>
  <text start="435.2" dur="3.9">should use the full power of the Fed to</text>
  <text start="436.94" dur="4.53">make sure that Trump doesn&amp;#39;t get elected</text>
  <text start="439.1" dur="5.13">then he tried to backtrack on that he</text>
  <text start="441.47" dur="5.04">exposed the entire central bank system</text>
  <text start="444.23" dur="4.14">and they said oh crap look what I did</text>
  <text start="446.51" dur="5.84">and he tried to backtrack the entire</text>
  <text start="448.37" dur="8.21">thing he&amp;#39;s out there and he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="452.35" dur="8.65">regain the narrative saying that Powell</text>
  <text start="456.58" dur="8.14">has started to push back on Trump that</text>
  <text start="461" dur="7.2">Powell he&amp;#39;s controlling the narrative</text>
  <text start="464.72" dur="7.53">that he&amp;#39;s going to make the decisions on</text>
  <text start="468.2" dur="4.62">what comes next not Trump and I hate to</text>
  <text start="472.25" dur="4.74">say it</text>
  <text start="472.82" dur="8.55">he is completely wrong he&amp;#39;s pushing this</text>
  <text start="476.99" dur="8.09">angle because he knows he&amp;#39;s lost the</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="6.51">narrative he wouldn&amp;#39;t have to say that</text>
  <text start="485.08" dur="8.17">Powell is pushing back</text>
  <text start="487.88" dur="7.32">if Powell was already in charge if he</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="4.32">already controlled the narrative was</text>
  <text start="495.2" dur="4.14">already making the decisions he would</text>
  <text start="497.57" dur="4.89">never even have to mention this the</text>
  <text start="499.34" dur="7.2">reason he&amp;#39;s mentioning this is because</text>
  <text start="502.46" dur="6.93">Powell is not in control he went on to</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="5.34">say that people are not sure now if the</text>
  <text start="509.39" dur="4.74">Fed is easing because that is the</text>
  <text start="511.88" dur="6.75">appropriate policy path or because of</text>
  <text start="514.13" dur="6.74">pressure from the president who think</text>
  <text start="518.63" dur="5.85">about what he just said here</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="6.67">Trump is continually pointing the finger</text>
  <text start="524.48" dur="5.91">at the Fed and he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="527.54" dur="6.45">people are unsure now is the Fed being</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="6.29">pressured from the President to do what</text>
  <text start="533.99" dur="6.78">he wants think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="536.68" dur="7.36">if the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t do what Trump wants</text>
  <text start="540.77" dur="5.25">and Trump is calling the shots this is</text>
  <text start="544.04" dur="6.51">what he wants and the economy falls</text>
  <text start="546.02" dur="7.49">apart the Fed is doomed if the Fed does</text>
  <text start="550.55" dur="5.67">what he wants and lowers the rates</text>
  <text start="553.51" dur="6.19">starts stimulus and the economy takes</text>
  <text start="556.22" dur="5.35">off Trump is calling the shots the Fed</text>
  <text start="559.7" dur="5.439">is following along</text>
  <text start="561.57" dur="8.22">they&amp;#39;ve already lost there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="565.139" dur="9.931">around this and the Fed is splitting up</text>
  <text start="569.79" dur="8.489">the Fed there each individual within the</text>
  <text start="575.07" dur="6.569">Fed they are now taking sides some say</text>
  <text start="578.279" dur="6.36">yes rate cuts some say no we can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="581.639" dur="4.741">that so we have the good central bankers</text>
  <text start="584.639" dur="4.68">and the bad central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="586.38" dur="4.8">starting to split now of course Dudley&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="589.319" dur="4.26">out there saying that there&amp;#39;s no big</text>
  <text start="591.18" dur="5.3">split at the Fed yes there is</text>
  <text start="593.579" dur="5.49">you can already see it in their voting</text>
  <text start="596.48" dur="6.31">the Patriots now controlled the entire</text>
  <text start="599.069" dur="6.75">narrative of what is happening with this</text>
  <text start="602.79" dur="5.669">economy the central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="605.819" dur="4.341">panicking and they should be because</text>
  <text start="608.459" dur="5.581">this is just the beginning</text>
  <text start="610.16" dur="7.75">this is just the first round this is</text>
  <text start="614.04" dur="6.21">going to get a lot worse as we move</text>
  <text start="617.91" dur="6.359">forward because once Trump takes the</text>
  <text start="620.25" dur="8.49">power away from them once Trump exposes</text>
  <text start="624.269" dur="7.32">them once the audit goes through and I</text>
  <text start="628.74" dur="4.95">do believe that they are going to push</text>
  <text start="631.589" dur="5.281">this and they&amp;#39;re gonna push this very</text>
  <text start="633.69" dur="7.17">slowly I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised within</text>
  <text start="636.87" dur="6.6">maybe 2020 Trump starts hinting at why</text>
  <text start="640.86" dur="5.159">haven&amp;#39;t we ordered the Fed when was the</text>
  <text start="643.47" dur="4.26">last time yet the Fed was audited I do</text>
  <text start="646.019" dur="4.981">believe that he&amp;#39;s gonna start saying</text>
  <text start="647.73" dur="5.19">this just like we said he was gonna</text>
  <text start="651" dur="4.74">continually point the finger at the Fed</text>
  <text start="652.92" dur="6.3">blame the Fed push the Fed in to what he</text>
  <text start="655.74" dur="5.7">wants them to do look at us today look</text>
  <text start="659.22" dur="3.679">what the Fed is doing and I do believe</text>
  <text start="661.44" dur="3.78">in 2020</text>
  <text start="662.899" dur="4.271">right before the election right after</text>
  <text start="665.22" dur="5.359">the election he&amp;#39;s gonna start to bring</text>
  <text start="667.17" dur="7.26">up why can&amp;#39;t we look at the books</text>
  <text start="670.579" dur="5.681">why aren&amp;#39;t they transparent why haven&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="682.41" dur="3.599">what&amp;#39;s coming and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="683.73" dur="3.45">control all of this they tried to bring</text>
  <text start="686.009" dur="3">the economy down with the mainstream</text>
  <text start="687.18" dur="4.23">media saying there&amp;#39;s a recession coming</text>
  <text start="689.009" dur="5.991">they tried to use tariffs they tried</text>
  <text start="691.41" dur="8.09">everything and they had to do it before</text>
  <text start="695" dur="5.42">the Fed cut the rates and starts the</text>
  <text start="699.5" dur="3.99">stimulus</text>
  <text start="700.42" dur="7.78">well stimulus is coming to two months</text>
  <text start="703.49" dur="7.7">away they&amp;#39;re going to be too late Trump</text>
