  <text start="56.07" dur="5.669">lot of gold sold off and the total</text>
  <text start="59.79" dur="5.13">volume of this crash was it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="5.671">suspicious because there was an excess</text>
  <text start="64.92" dur="5.19">of a thousand tons of paper contracts</text>
  <text start="67.41" dur="6.72">that were dumped on the market in a</text>
  <text start="70.11" dur="6.27">matter of hours that&amp;#39;s one third of the</text>
  <text start="74.13" dur="7.2">entire world&amp;#39;s annual gold production</text>
  <text start="76.38" dur="8.7">from mining activities so does this</text>
  <text start="81.33" dur="6.2">sound like normal trading behavior no it</text>
  <text start="85.08" dur="4.8">doesn&amp;#39;t what makes this drop even more</text>
  <text start="87.53" dur="5.44">interesting is that it happened on</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="5.37">Tuesday right after the bank holiday in</text>
  <text start="92.97" dur="5.55">Germany because the financial markets</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="6.45">were closed on Monday in Germany and</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="5.599">this is when we heard a lot of this</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="6.36">information coming out of doja bank and</text>
  <text start="104.119" dur="7.051">we can see that Deutsche Bank is in a</text>
  <text start="108.06" dur="5.82">lot of trouble they&amp;#39;re still in trouble</text>
  <text start="111.17" dur="5.02">right now Deutsche Bank issued its first</text>
  <text start="113.88" dur="4.019">US dollar denominated bond in five</text>
  <text start="116.19" dur="4.56">months which raised about three billion</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="5.22">in paper but do it your bank doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="3.66">have many options and I know the news is</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="3.571">out there in the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="124.41" dur="5.01">there telling you that oh the derivative</text>
  <text start="126.69" dur="5.58">book that Deutsche Bank has it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="5.28">that big of a deal it&amp;#39;s not as big as</text>
  <text start="132.27" dur="4.38">everyone is saying and if something does</text>
  <text start="134.7" dur="3.99">happen it&amp;#39;s not going to cause a chain</text>
  <text start="136.65" dur="3.66">reaction this is actually coming out of</text>
  <text start="138.69" dur="4.35">the corporate media and every time you</text>
  <text start="140.31" dur="4.98">start to hear stuff like that you know</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s the opposite of what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="145.29" dur="4.68">just like they told you like oh it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="4.38">that big of a deal AIG is fine they only</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="3.659">need one bailout that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="3.21">gonna need the rest of the banks and</text>
  <text start="153.629" dur="3.571">everything else all the financial</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="4.83">institutions everything else is fine we</text>
  <text start="157.2" dur="4.74">have it all contained well we see with</text>
  <text start="159.72" dur="3.9">Deutsche Bank right now you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.94" dur="2.28">a lot of noise about them selling their</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="4.77">assets</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="5.7">and if they did sell their assets you</text>
  <text start="168.39" dur="7.05">know they might raise what like 10</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="9.15">billion euro and it&amp;#39;s not even enough</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="6.51">they need a lot more than that so what</text>
  <text start="179.07" dur="6.27">are the other two options well they have</text>
  <text start="181.95" dur="7.82">an option of a bailout and they have an</text>
  <text start="185.34" dur="8.7">option of a bail in because as we know</text>
  <text start="189.77" dur="6.73">Europe the United States Canada UK many</text>
  <text start="194.04" dur="6">other countries they have created the</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="7.05">beylin documents and we can see right</text>
  <text start="200.04" dur="5.58">now that Germany has already said that</text>
  <text start="203.55" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re not going to do a bailout and if</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="6.45">they do it do a bailout other banks are</text>
  <text start="208.77" dur="4.68">going to come forward and say you know</text>
  <text start="212.07" dur="3.51">something you bailed out Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="4.11">we need to bail out all these early</text>
  <text start="215.58" dur="5.37">banks we need to bail out the Spanish</text>
  <text start="217.56" dur="6.63">banks and this will continue on now what</text>
  <text start="220.95" dur="5.94">about the balance well this might be</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="5.03">catastrophic even though they have the</text>
  <text start="226.89" dur="5.129">documents and everything&amp;#39;s ready to go</text>
  <text start="229.22" dur="6.13">this might be a huge problem because if</text>
  <text start="232.019" dur="5.731">the rest of the world and the rest of</text>
  <text start="235.35" dur="4.59">investors and people who have their</text>
  <text start="237.75" dur="4.56">monies with these banks they see them</text>
  <text start="239.94" dur="5.28">going into the bank taking the funds</text>
  <text start="242.31" dur="3.3">their people are going to run for the</text>
  <text start="245.22" dur="4.98">hills</text>
  <text start="245.61" dur="6.48">so Deutsche Bank is in a situation where</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="4.95">they need to come up with some type of</text>
  <text start="252.09" dur="5.13">answer because otherwise it looks like</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="4.769">this entire system is going to be come</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="4.829">crumbling down and we know if Deutsche</text>
  <text start="259.919" dur="4.051">Bank goes it is connected to many many</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="3.661">other banks and that there will be a</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="4.14">chain reaction now we know the</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="5.25">Department of Justice placed a fine</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="7.47">under G Bank and this looks like this is</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="6.57">a signal to Germany to listen you need</text>
  <text start="275.58" dur="7.05">to go along with what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="277.53" dur="7.56">or else and we see that John crying the</text>
  <text start="282.63" dur="4.32">CEO of Deutsche Bank visited the United</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="5.01">States a try to come up with some type</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="4.05">of deal and he couldn&amp;#39;t reach an</text>
  <text start="290.1" dur="3.03">agreement with the United States</text>
  <text start="291" dur="3.9">Department of Justice so right now</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="3.9">everything stands and it looks like</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re heading down this path where</text>
  <text start="297.03" dur="4.56">everything might</text>
  <text start="298.47" dur="6.09">start to implode and it looks like with</text>
  <text start="301.59" dur="5.4">this suppression of the precious metals</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="4.23">we might be heading down this path and</text>
  <text start="306.99" dur="6.2">it might be coming much sooner than</text>
  <text start="308.79" dur="6.78">everyone thinks we see out in Iceland on</text>
  <text start="313.19" dur="4.87">Thursday Iceland Supreme Court found</text>
  <text start="315.57" dur="5.67">nine bankers guilty of market</text>
  <text start="318.06" dur="5.52">manipulation and we know that Iceland</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="4.8">has taken their bankers since the 2008</text>
  <text start="323.58" dur="6.77">crisis and thrown them into jail</text>
  <text start="326.04" dur="8.04">something the United States will not do</text>
  <text start="330.35" dur="6.73">because as we know the central bank the</text>
  <text start="334.08" dur="5.22">banks the government all of its</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="5.99">intertwined they all work together it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.3" dur="8.36">all part of the same exact machine and</text>
  <text start="343.07" dur="8.08">this is what makes up a fascist country</text>
  <text start="347.66" dur="6.91">we see dude or Tay he is out there and</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="6">he is telling the United States listen I</text>
  <text start="354.57" dur="4.62">know what you&amp;#39;re gonna try I know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.15" dur="5.16">gonna try to oust me one way or another</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="7.8">and he&amp;#39;s telling the United States that</text>
  <text start="362.31" dur="8.4">listen bring on the CIA try to get rid</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="6.63">of me and we know this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="370.71" dur="4.41">the United States would love to do we</text>
  <text start="373.62" dur="4.74">know they would want to go in there and</text>
  <text start="375.12" dur="4.59">remove Giudice and we can see this</text>
  <text start="378.36" dur="3.44">happening because they want the</text>
  <text start="379.71" dur="5.58">Philippines it&amp;#39;s a strategic location</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="6.28">it&amp;#39;s part of the encircling of China so</text>
  <text start="385.29" dur="6.78">we might see this happen sooner than</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="8.28">later we see out in Yemen there was a</text>
  <text start="392.07" dur="8.67">huge bombing during a funeral about 140</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="6.72">killed 500 or so injured and this came</text>
  <text start="400.74" dur="4.5">from the saudi-led coalition who</text>
  <text start="403.08" dur="4.53">targeted a building hosting a hootie</text>
  <text start="405.24" dur="4.95">funeral ceremony and we&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="407.61" dur="4.29">many many times before the United States</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="3.12">government central bankers Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="411.9" dur="6.09">the paid mercenaries that are bombing</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="7.17">Yemen they&amp;#39;re going after the people to</text>
  <text start="417.99" dur="5.01">say listen if you do not accept our</text>
  <text start="420.48" dur="4.2">puppet government and you do not let our</text>
  <text start="423" dur="4.77">government back into the country and</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="4.95">rule you we will make your life very</text>
  <text start="427.77" dur="4.56">difficult while the United Nations was</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="6.349">out there and they&amp;#39;re condemning what is</text>
  <text start="432.33" dur="5.64">happened and it was a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="435.979" dur="3.881">and we can see the United States</text>
  <text start="437.97" dur="4.77">government central bankers with Saudi</text>
  <text start="439.86" dur="4.739">Arabia that is their proxy army where</text>
  <text start="442.74" dur="4.429">they&amp;#39;re bombing Yemen remember Yemen</text>
  <text start="444.599" dur="5.641">never attacked Saudi Arabia whatsoever</text>
  <text start="447.169" dur="5.921">Saudi Arabia they thought this was going</text>
  <text start="450.24" dur="5.04">to be over in a couple of months this</text>
  <text start="453.09" dur="5.25">has been going on for a very long time</text>
  <text start="455.28" dur="6.12">and Saudi Arabia right now is using</text>
  <text start="458.34" dur="6.629">mostly paid mercenaries to fight in</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="5.1">Yemen we see Russia is looking at the</text>
  <text start="464.969" dur="3.901">situation with NATO and the United</text>
  <text start="466.5" dur="5.4">States and they&amp;#39;re realizing that the</text>
  <text start="468.87" dur="4.889">United States is pushing for war I mean</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="3.419">we&amp;#39;ve been following this we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="473.759" dur="3.601">tracking this we&amp;#39;ve been watching the</text>
  <text start="475.319" dur="3.6">military s asset movements we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="477.36" dur="4.29">watching the military troop movements</text>
  <text start="478.919" dur="6.15">and we can see with the missile shield</text>
  <text start="481.65" dur="5.699">in Europe that is not there for Iran</text>
  <text start="485.069" dur="5.34">that is actually there for China and</text>
  <text start="487.349" dur="6.12">Russia and Russia is going to deploy</text>
  <text start="490.409" dur="6.091">there is skander missile in Kalen Grad</text>
  <text start="493.469" dur="6">to neutralize the anti-ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="496.5" dur="5.49">system in europe and remember everything</text>
  <text start="499.469" dur="4.801">that Russia is putting together here is</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="4.799">within their country</text>
  <text start="504.27" dur="5.97">everything the United States and NATO is</text>
  <text start="506.789" dur="6.3">doing is outside of the United States</text>
  <text start="510.24" dur="5.13">and moving into other countries right up</text>
  <text start="513.089" dur="5.7">to the border of Russia can you imagine</text>
  <text start="515.37" dur="5.76">if Russia was placing missiles in Canada</text>
  <text start="518.789" dur="4.68">and Mexico how would the United States</text>
  <text start="521.13" dur="4.199">government central bankers feel at this</text>
  <text start="523.469" dur="3.81">point they would feel like hmm why is</text>
  <text start="525.329" dur="5.041">Russia doing this why are they putting</text>
  <text start="527.279" dur="5.641">missile systems on our borders well this</text>
  <text start="530.37" dur="5.029">is what Russia is looking at and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.92" dur="5.07">saying this makes no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="535.399" dur="4.18">but Russia knows that the United States</text>
  <text start="537.99" dur="4.409">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="539.579" dur="4.081">pushing for war they can see it they</text>
  <text start="542.399" dur="2.821">understand what&amp;#39;s happening they</text>
  <text start="543.66" dur="3.51">understand the United States does not</text>
  <text start="545.22" dur="4.4">want peace they do not want ceasefire</text>
  <text start="547.17" dur="4.62">they want nothing like this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="549.62" dur="4.35">we see the United States government</text>
  <text start="551.79" dur="5.039">central bankers they are using</text>
  <text start="553.97" dur="6.55">propaganda right now to convince the</text>
  <text start="556.829" dur="6.481">world that Russia and Syria are barbaric</text>
  <text start="560.52" dur="5.4">that they&amp;#39;re destroying Aleppo that</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re bombing civilians this is</text>
  <text start="565.92" dur="5.13">furthest from the truth what is</text>
  <text start="567.45" dur="6.36">happening in Aleppo is Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="571.05" dur="5.76">they are surrounding Aleppo they have</text>
  <text start="573.81" dur="6.029">captured many areas within the district</text>
  <text start="576.81" dur="5.42">and they are forcing the terrorists the</text>
  <text start="579.839" dur="4.8">moderate rebels the terrorists out of</text>
  <text start="582.23" dur="5.74">Aleppo now this is the paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="584.639" dur="4.651">army of the United States and the United</text>
  <text start="587.97" dur="4.229">States right now the United States</text>
  <text start="589.29" dur="5.729">government they are trying to stop this</text>
  <text start="592.199" dur="6.75">any way they possibly can so they put</text>
  <text start="595.019" dur="6.421">forth a resolution in the UN now the</text>
  <text start="598.949" dur="5.341">French draft of the resolution saying we</text>
  <text start="601.44" dur="5.399">need to stop the bombing in Aleppo it is</text>
  <text start="604.29" dur="5.489">barbaric we need to have some type of</text>
  <text start="606.839" dur="7.101">ceasefire or Russia veto to this they</text>
  <text start="609.779" dur="7.68">vetoed the entire draft and said listen</text>
  <text start="613.94" dur="6.97">separate the moderate rebels from the</text>
  <text start="617.459" dur="7.411">terrorists we won&amp;#39;t have a problem there</text>
  <text start="620.91" dur="7.679">anymore so Russia said ok we will draft</text>
  <text start="624.87" dur="5.04">a resolution that states the United</text>
  <text start="628.589" dur="4.801">States government central bankers the</text>
  <text start="629.91" dur="6.21">coalition forces must separate the</text>
  <text start="633.39" dur="6.389">moderate rebels from the terrorists well</text>
  <text start="636.12" dur="7.14">that didn&amp;#39;t pass either so right now we</text>
  <text start="639.779" dur="7.111">have a situation where nothing was</text>
  <text start="643.26" dur="7.43">settled on and Russia and Syria are</text>
  <text start="646.89" dur="7.29">about to take the entire area of Aleppo</text>
  <text start="650.69" dur="6.209">which makes us worried right now because</text>
  <text start="654.18" dur="5.94">we understand that if Aleppo is</text>
  <text start="656.899" dur="6.011">completely taken over by the Syrian</text>
  <text start="660.12" dur="5.459">government and Russia and is removed</text>
  <text start="662.91" dur="4.98">from the terrorists the United States</text>
  <text start="665.579" dur="6.061">government central bankers the United</text>
  <text start="667.89" dur="7.5">States government is really at a</text>
  <text start="671.64" dur="7.05">disadvantage where there is no reason</text>
  <text start="675.39" dur="6.72">for them to even be in Syria they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="678.69" dur="5.79">make the case that they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="682.11" dur="4.2">the Islamic state because Sergey Lavrov</text>
  <text start="684.48" dur="3.99">already called out the United States</text>
  <text start="686.31" dur="4.259">saying United States is making a lot of</text>
  <text start="688.47" dur="4.38">flights over Syria but we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="690.569" dur="5.161">watching them over Aleppo and they are</text>
  <text start="692.85" dur="5.489">not bombing the terrace whatsoever</text>
  <text start="695.73" dur="4.1">they&amp;#39;re not bombing al-nusra they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="698.339" dur="3.44">bombing al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="699.83" dur="6.9">they&amp;#39;re not Biman the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="701.779" dur="8.131">they&amp;#39;re just flying over that is it why</text>
  <text start="706.73" dur="5.85">because they&amp;#39;re trying to protect them</text>
  <text start="709.91" dur="5.34">but if they start bombing the Syrian</text>
  <text start="712.58" dur="4.08">army or the Russian forces there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="715.25" dur="3.72">huge problem so the United States</text>
  <text start="716.66" dur="4.47">government central bankers they need to</text>
  <text start="718.97" dur="5.73">do something where they can create a</text>
  <text start="721.13" dur="8.699">false flag where they have to make it</text>
  <text start="724.7" dur="8.46">look like Russia Syria they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="729.829" dur="7.291">who caused this problem and on Friday I</text>
  <text start="733.16" dur="6.84">mentioned how US planes f-18s they were</text>
  <text start="737.12" dur="4.44">painted to look like Russian planes this</text>
  <text start="740" dur="4.35">might be part of a false flag but there</text>
  <text start="741.56" dur="5.76">also might be something else that might</text>
  <text start="744.35" dur="7.83">occur because if they can show some type</text>
  <text start="747.32" dur="10.709">of evidence that Syria or Russia were</text>
  <text start="752.18" dur="8.04">attacking and hitting these targets they</text>
  <text start="758.029" dur="4.62">can make the case where they can go</text>
  <text start="760.22" dur="6.619">after Syria and Russia if they can show</text>
  <text start="762.649" dur="6.301">Russia or Syria bombing maybe US troops</text>
  <text start="766.839" dur="3.881">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="768.95" dur="3.93">bankers would play this up with</text>
  <text start="770.72" dur="5.76">propaganda to convince the world that</text>
  <text start="772.88" dur="5.16">Russia or Syria has just attacked I mean</text>
  <text start="776.48" dur="3.54">this is just one scenario I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="778.04" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re gonna come up with some other</text>
  <text start="780.02" dur="4.17">type of scenario but this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="782.75" dur="4.589">watching right now because we can see</text>
  <text start="784.19" dur="4.68">right now that the situation in Syria it</text>
  <text start="787.339" dur="3.091">is not going well for the United States</text>
  <text start="788.87" dur="4.92">government central bankers and this is</text>
  <text start="790.43" dur="7.74">all part of their plan to keep the petro</text>
  <text start="793.79" dur="8.659">dollar propped up because once they lose</text>
  <text start="798.17" dur="7.95">Syria this game is over the entire</text>
  <text start="802.449" dur="7.51">economy this is all wrapped around this</text>
  <text start="806.12" dur="6.54">entire economic collapse that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="809.959" dur="5.49">seeing right now everything is</text>
  <text start="812.66" dur="5.19">interconnected with this the amount of</text>
  <text start="815.449" dur="3.75">debt that is around the world what the</text>
  <text start="817.85" dur="5.16">United States is doing in the Middle</text>
  <text start="819.199" dur="7.411">East the oil hooked up to the petro</text>
  <text start="823.01" dur="6.48">dollar the central banking system it is</text>
  <text start="826.61" dur="6.58">all connected and it is all falling</text>
  <text start="829.49" dur="6.34">apart at the same time</text>
  <text start="833.19" dur="6.81">so the United States right now decided</text>
  <text start="835.83" dur="5.43">to come out with a statement and this</text>
  <text start="840" dur="3.78">came from the Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="841.26" dur="6.51">Security the national intelligence</text>
  <text start="843.78" dur="8.09">agencies saying that yes Russia was</text>
  <text start="847.77" dur="7.53">behind the cyber attacks and they were</text>
  <text start="851.87" dur="7.24">intending to interfere with the u.s.</text>
  <text start="855.3" dur="5.1">election process now of course the</text>
  <text start="859.11" dur="7.35">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="860.4" dur="10.02">as usual has no evidence to prove what</text>
  <text start="866.46" dur="5.73">they just said none exists they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="870.42" dur="4.37">out there using propaganda and we have</text>
  <text start="872.19" dur="5.16">to remember going back to 2011 NDAA</text>
  <text start="874.79" dur="3.97">Section 501 C the United States is</text>
  <text start="877.35" dur="3.06">allowed to use propaganda on the</text>
  <text start="878.76" dur="3.33">American people and all they have to do</text>
  <text start="880.41" dur="4.5">is put a headline out there and people</text>
  <text start="882.09" dur="4.62">will believe they never have to follow</text>
  <text start="884.91" dur="2.81">it up with any type of proof or anything</text>
  <text start="886.71" dur="3.45">like that</text>
  <text start="887.72" dur="5.41">but it&amp;#39;s very simple instead of using</text>
  <text start="890.16" dur="6.15">electronic voting systems use paper</text>
  <text start="893.13" dur="4.86">ballots have each District collect the</text>
  <text start="896.31" dur="4.53">paper ballots have it counted in front</text>
  <text start="897.99" dur="5.52">of each town in that little area have</text>
  <text start="900.84" dur="6.21">the number post it in the town have that</text>
  <text start="903.51" dur="5.55">number filtered up to the next level and</text>
  <text start="907.05" dur="4.38">all the way up to the top you never even</text>
  <text start="909.06" dur="3.57">have to worry about a cyber attack but</text>
  <text start="911.43" dur="2.87">they don&amp;#39;t want to do that because then</text>
  <text start="912.63" dur="4.98">they can&amp;#39;t manipulate the elections and</text>
  <text start="914.3" dur="4.54">we can see right now that the United</text>
  <text start="917.61" dur="3.63">States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="918.84" dur="8.96">they&amp;#39;re looking to place sanctions on</text>
  <text start="921.24" dur="9.66">Russia for attacking the election system</text>
  <text start="927.8" dur="5.89">now of course this is to provoke Russia</text>
  <text start="930.9" dur="5.43">once again now we can see from the past</text>
  <text start="933.69" dur="4.62">that Russia is not easily provoked they</text>
  <text start="936.33" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t come out and say okay now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="938.31" dur="3.27">going to attack you actually they do the</text>
  <text start="940.29" dur="4.26">opposite of what the United States</text>
  <text start="941.58" dur="4.95">expects they always say okay you know</text>
  <text start="944.55" dur="4.49">something let&amp;#39;s have talks let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="946.53" dur="5.4">about peace let&amp;#39;s talk about a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="949.04" dur="4.12">let&amp;#39;s calm the situation down but the</text>
  <text start="951.93" dur="4.56">Unites States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="953.16" dur="8.01">they don&amp;#39;t want this they want Russia to</text>
  <text start="956.49" dur="6.96">do something now from this announcement</text>
  <text start="961.17" dur="4.89">that Russia was behind these cyber</text>
  <text start="963.45" dur="5.46">attacks it looks like</text>
  <text start="966.06" dur="5.1">the powers that be the elite the central</text>
  <text start="968.91" dur="5.31">bankers they&amp;#39;re very worried about the</text>
  <text start="971.16" dur="6.24">elections and we can see right now just</text>
  <text start="974.22" dur="6.99">from this announcement it could be that</text>
  <text start="977.4" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re preparing to postpone these</text>
  <text start="981.21" dur="5.67">elections somehow someway now they they</text>
  <text start="984.21" dur="4.83">won&amp;#39;t need any proof to show that as the</text>
  <text start="986.88" dur="4.41">elections are going on that Russia came</text>
  <text start="989.04" dur="3.75">in and cyber attacked the elections they</text>
  <text start="991.29" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t need proof of this they can just</text>
  <text start="992.79" dur="3.75">halt it if it&amp;#39;s not going their way and</text>
  <text start="994.86" dur="4.98">saying we need to stop this because</text>

  <text start="1010.13" dur="4.74">say we need to postpone this until we</text>
  <text start="1012.77" dur="3.72">figure it out now the only reason they</text>
  <text start="1014.87" dur="3.6">would do this is it&amp;#39;s because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
