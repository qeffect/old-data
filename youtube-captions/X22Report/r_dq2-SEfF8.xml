  <text start="189.299" dur="5.981">twenty-three thousand of those jobs are</text>
  <text start="191.909" dur="7.481">rotating jobs but they count them as</text>
  <text start="195.28" dur="6.569">full-time jobs and this is how they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="206.379" dur="4.86">people who are falling off and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.569" dur="4.711">trying to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="211.239" dur="5.97">situation in Greece is improving</text>
  <text start="213.28" dur="6.629">incredibly but again twenty-three</text>
  <text start="217.209" dur="6.06">percent unemployment that&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="219.909" dur="8.311">recovery I mean for all intents purposes</text>
  <text start="223.269" dur="7.741">that&amp;#39;s a depression and we can see right</text>
  <text start="228.22" dur="5.04">now that people yes are still struggling</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="6.53">in Greece they&amp;#39;re struggling in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="7.979">Italy France you name it the EU is a</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="7.33">complete disaster here in the United</text>
  <text start="241.239" dur="6.81">States we see very interesting things</text>
  <text start="244.87" dur="6.39">happening here in Dallas we see the</text>
  <text start="248.049" dur="7.59">police and fire pension systems well</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="8.219">they suspended all withdrawals last week</text>
  <text start="255.639" dur="10.71">and we see the move stopped 154 million</text>
  <text start="259.479" dur="9.781">dollars leaving the pension system now</text>
  <text start="266.349" dur="5.761">if they allowed those withdrawals to go</text>
  <text start="269.26" dur="4.32">through the phone will be below the 600</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="5.809">million in liquid assets that is</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="6.869">required to maintain the 2.1 billion fun</text>
  <text start="277.919" dur="7.24">500 million has already been withdrawn</text>
  <text start="280.449" dur="7.921">and the fun right now is looking for a</text>
  <text start="285.159" dur="7.04">bailout of 1.1 billion from the city</text>
  <text start="288.37" dur="6.24">taxpayers actually this is how Rome fell</text>
  <text start="292.199" dur="5.171">once they could not fund the pensions</text>
  <text start="294.61" dur="5">the military began sacking their own</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="6.9">cities to get what they were owed and</text>
  <text start="299.61" dur="6.22">these individuals in Dallas well they</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="3.99">might do the same thing and this is</text>
  <text start="305.83" dur="5.43">going to spread to other municipalities</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="4.68">to other cities because as we know the</text>
  <text start="311.26" dur="4.98">pension system</text>
  <text start="312.94" dur="4.77">completely underfunded and when this</text>
  <text start="316.24" dur="4.14">system comes down and all these</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="6.09">investments in the passion systems start</text>
  <text start="320.38" dur="6.66">to completely implode on themselves it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="6.36">going to be a complete disaster and we</text>
  <text start="327.04" dur="5.01">can see that throughout this country we</text>
  <text start="330.16" dur="6.63">have a major problem on our hands right</text>
  <text start="332.05" dur="7.08">now out in India the situation is not</text>
  <text start="336.79" dur="4.74">improving whatsoever and we should look</text>
  <text start="339.13" dur="5.42">at this because the central bankers</text>
  <text start="341.53" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re using this as their test case</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="6.13">just like Cyprus with the balance with</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="5.52">Greece with stealing the wealth of the</text>
  <text start="350.68" dur="7.98">people taking the pension money from the</text>
  <text start="353.86" dur="10.71">people we see ever since Modi decided to</text>
  <text start="358.66" dur="9.48">d monetize the five hundred rupee we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.57" dur="6.72">seeing major problems inside India</text>
  <text start="368.14" dur="5.22">Foxconn has as twenty-five percent of</text>
  <text start="371.29" dur="5.54">its workforce to leave after the cash</text>
  <text start="373.36" dur="5.88">man cause sales to collapse by 50%</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="5.92">forcing the company to slash production</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="5.82">in half and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="5.4">something very important about paper</text>
  <text start="385.06" dur="7.05">currency when it&amp;#39;s backed by absolutely</text>
  <text start="388.15" dur="6.39">nothing our entire monetary system well</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="4.77">it depends on trust a banknote is a</text>
  <text start="394.54" dur="4.62">piece of paper that says the RBI will</text>
  <text start="396.88" dur="4.83">give the bearer another similar piece of</text>
  <text start="399.16" dur="6.09">paper or make an entry in electronic</text>
  <text start="401.71" dur="6.15">ledger for that amount the system works</text>
  <text start="405.25" dur="4.53">because everyone believes that those</text>
  <text start="407.86" dur="4.77">pieces of paper will be accepted by</text>
  <text start="409.78" dur="7.43">everybody else and therefore money</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="9.09">serves as a useful medium of exchange</text>
  <text start="417.21" dur="9.09">when the trust is shaken the system</text>
  <text start="421.72" dur="8.25">falls apart and we are seeing this in</text>
  <text start="426.3" dur="6.43">many different countries it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="429.97" dur="7.83">happening in India we&amp;#39;re seeing it in</text>
  <text start="432.73" dur="6.9">Venezuela and this will spread actually</text>
  <text start="437.8" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;re seeing it with the dollar because</text>
  <text start="439.63" dur="3.21">there are many countries out there who</text>
  <text start="441.01" dur="4.23">are saying you know something let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.84" dur="5.91">trade in our own currency</text>
  <text start="445.24" dur="5.25">see let&amp;#39;s bypass the dollar and what</text>
  <text start="448.75" dur="7.349">that really means is they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="450.49" dur="10.35">faith in the dollar and this is the</text>
  <text start="456.099" dur="6.871">first step in India right now sixty-five</text>
  <text start="460.84" dur="4.56">percent of the ATMs their</text>
  <text start="462.97" dur="5.729">non-operational think about this for a</text>
  <text start="465.4" dur="6.57">second only thirty five percent of these</text>
  <text start="468.699" dur="4.711">ATMs throughout the country well those</text>
  <text start="471.97" dur="6.33">are the only ones that have cash</text>
  <text start="473.41" dur="6.78">sixty-five percent do not think about</text>
  <text start="478.3" dur="7.56">here in this country if sixty-five</text>
  <text start="480.19" dur="7.02">percent of the ATMs did not work where</text>
  <text start="485.86" dur="3.029">would people get cash because you know</text>
  <text start="487.21" dur="2.609">the banks don&amp;#39;t have it you know the</text>
  <text start="488.889" dur="2.161">people we&amp;#39;re going to go in and say</text>
  <text start="489.819" dur="2.521">instead of two hundred dollars or one</text>
  <text start="491.05" dur="6.619">hundred dollars or twenty dollars I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="492.34" dur="7.949">one at all well we can see the system is</text>
  <text start="497.669" dur="7.451">breaking down in India right now in</text>
  <text start="500.289" dur="7.801">Venezuela we see Maduro well it looks</text>
  <text start="505.12" dur="8.669">like he&amp;#39;s eliminating his currency the</text>
  <text start="508.09" dur="7.02">100-dollar the 100 bulevar bill he</text>
  <text start="513.789" dur="7.021">decided to take this out of circulation</text>
  <text start="515.11" dur="8.01">and we can see right now that if he</text>
  <text start="520.81" dur="7.7">takes the 100 Boulevard and a</text>
  <text start="523.12" dur="8.93">circulation well this makes up</text>
  <text start="528.51" dur="6.61">forty-eight percent of all bills and</text>
  <text start="532.05" dur="5.95">coins in other words venema Venezuela</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="7.529">just eliminated half the paper cash in</text>
  <text start="538" dur="7.77">circulation and they&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="542.649" dur="8.071">inflation this year to be close to five</text>
  <text start="545.77" dur="10.05">hundred percent eco analytica estimates</text>
  <text start="550.72" dur="6.989">that this is where it&amp;#39;s going and we can</text>
  <text start="555.82" dur="5.1">see right now that when we look at</text>
  <text start="557.709" dur="5.931">Venezuela when we look at India when we</text>
  <text start="560.92" dur="6">look at Cyprus when we look at Greece</text>
  <text start="563.64" dur="6.22">now when we look at Italy we see things</text>
  <text start="566.92" dur="5.85">are really breaking down the situation</text>
  <text start="569.86" dur="5.849">is not improving it&amp;#39;s actually getting</text>
  <text start="572.77" dur="4.559">worse because this is what it looks like</text>
  <text start="575.709" dur="4.011">when the system starts to break down and</text>
  <text start="577.329" dur="5.731">it accelerates</text>
  <text start="579.72" dur="4.87">more countries are hit government</text>
  <text start="583.06" dur="5.21">central banks start to do crazy things</text>
  <text start="584.59" dur="5.67">like this like remove and bein cash</text>
  <text start="588.27" dur="4.69">because what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="590.26" dur="5.48">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep the banking</text>
  <text start="592.96" dur="4.86">system afloat because if you remove cash</text>
  <text start="595.74" dur="3.52">people can&amp;#39;t take things out of the bank</text>
  <text start="597.82" dur="5.76">they can&amp;#39;t take their currency out of</text>
  <text start="599.26" dur="6.93">the bank and right now this is what</text>
  <text start="603.58" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re trying to do something very</text>
  <text start="606.19" dur="7.41">interesting with the Bank of Japan the</text>
  <text start="610.06" dur="6.21">Bank of Japan is now depreciating the</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="7.08">yen against the US dollar on almost an</text>
  <text start="616.27" dur="6.27">hourly basis this is the yen carry trade</text>
  <text start="620.68" dur="5.22">and it&amp;#39;s the single biggest driver of</text>
  <text start="622.54" dur="6.96">the markets today in the last two weeks</text>
  <text start="625.9" dur="7.11">the sp500 has following this pair almost</text>
  <text start="629.5" dur="6.27">tick for tick which is very interesting</text>
  <text start="633.01" dur="6.06">and we have to remember the yen is a</text>
  <text start="635.77" dur="7.68">major world currency and for it to move</text>
  <text start="639.07" dur="6.72">like this is almost unprecedented by</text>
  <text start="643.45" dur="5.1">some metrics the yen is now moving like</text>
  <text start="645.79" dur="6.36">a currency from a developing third world</text>
  <text start="648.55" dur="6.36">country and it looks like this price fix</text>
  <text start="652.15" dur="6.39">will break as all price fixes do and</text>
  <text start="654.91" dur="9.77">when it does the markets going to crash</text>
  <text start="658.54" dur="10.59">and the question is is Japan right now</text>
  <text start="664.68" dur="7.44">priming the market for a crash because</text>
  <text start="669.13" dur="5.54">we know the central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="672.12" dur="7.95">planning on bringing up bringing down</text>
  <text start="674.67" dur="7.93">this economy in a controlled fashion</text>
  <text start="680.07" dur="4.15">they don&amp;#39;t want the economies to come</text>
  <text start="682.6" dur="4.26">down by themselves they want complete</text>
  <text start="684.22" dur="5.46">control they want to say when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="686.86" dur="7.02">going to do it they don&amp;#39;t want a Black</text>
  <text start="689.68" dur="6.81">Swan they want everything in order so</text>
  <text start="693.88" dur="5.19">they can say okay we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="696.49" dur="4.98">implement balance we&amp;#39;re going to shut</text>
  <text start="699.07" dur="7.14">down the ATM machines we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="701.47" dur="7.8">declare bank holiday and just like big</text>
  <text start="706.21" dur="4.29">swear on the x 22 report spotlight when</text>
  <text start="709.27" dur="2.78">we have the discussion about what was</text>
  <text start="710.5" dur="7.55">going to happen</text>
  <text start="712.05" dur="8.75">currency is going to disappear the</text>
  <text start="718.05" dur="6.979">currency that you have in the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="720.8" dur="9.19">they&amp;#39;re no longer going to exist and</text>
  <text start="725.029" dur="7.361">this is why everyone and my opinion</text>
  <text start="729.99" dur="5.219">should take out as much currency as you</text>
  <text start="732.39" dur="5.879">possibly can hide it don&amp;#39;t tell anyone</text>
  <text start="735.209" dur="6.75">where it is keep whatever you need in</text>
  <text start="738.269" dur="7.291">there to pay your bills maybe convert it</text>
  <text start="741.959" dur="5.37">into gold and silver because when the</text>
  <text start="745.56" dur="5.31">system completely breaks down and</text>
  <text start="747.329" dur="5.7">crashes gold and silver is going to</text>
  <text start="750.87" dur="4.709">protect your wealth it has for thousands</text>
  <text start="753.029" dur="5.161">and thousands of years even though the</text>
  <text start="755.579" dur="5.25">corporate media the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="758.19" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t want you to believe this this is</text>
  <text start="760.829" dur="6">part of their brain washing over time to</text>
  <text start="763.56" dur="5.969">make you feel to make you believe that</text>
  <text start="766.829" dur="6.2">gold and silver they&amp;#39;re just used for</text>
  <text start="769.529" dur="9.3">jewelry for products they have no value</text>
