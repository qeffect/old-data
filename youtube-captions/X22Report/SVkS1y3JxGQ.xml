  <text start="32.189" dur="3.451">today&amp;#39;s date is March twenty seven</text>
  <text start="34.17" dur="3.06">twenty fourteen and the title of this</text>
  <text start="35.64" dur="3.509">episode is the economic recovery</text>
  <text start="37.23" dur="7.2">illusion is losing steam and the</text>
  <text start="39.149" dur="6.721">collapse is quickly approaching and how</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="4.17">do we know this let&amp;#39;s go back to two</text>
  <text start="45.87" dur="4.41">thousand eight we had a collapse of real</text>
  <text start="48.6" dur="3.63">estate we had a collapse of the</text>
  <text start="50.28" dur="4.259">financial system we have a collapse of</text>
  <text start="52.23" dur="4.469">pretty much everything at that point</text>
  <text start="54.539" dur="4.2">Americans lost thirty-eight percent of</text>
  <text start="56.699" dur="3.66">their wealth the government had to step</text>
  <text start="58.739" dur="4.32">in because all these financial</text>
  <text start="60.359" dur="4.801">institutions were pretty much done and</text>
  <text start="63.059" dur="3.931">they had to be bailed out once they were</text>
  <text start="65.16" dur="4.65">bailed out the Fed looked around and</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="5.07">said mmmm this economy is not going to</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="4.41">do well we need to start printing my</text>
  <text start="72.06" dur="5.25">money and start pumping up the stock</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="4.859">markets and again we need to take all</text>
  <text start="77.31" dur="3.69">this real estate take it off the books</text>
  <text start="79.079" dur="4.801">of the banks and we&amp;#39;ll just put it on</text>
  <text start="81" dur="4.29">the feds books and this is all they did</text>
  <text start="83.88" dur="3.39">was they transferred everything moved</text>
  <text start="85.29" dur="4.98">everything and we need to also give</text>
  <text start="87.27" dur="5.129">money to Europe and to the eurozone and</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="3.72">this is what they did ever since they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="92.399" dur="3.691">been pumping and pumping and pumping and</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="4.769">pumping and it reached the point where</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="5.19">QE wasn&amp;#39;t doing anything anymore it</text>
  <text start="98.759" dur="4.261">reached the point where as you if they</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="3.15">continually to pump the whole thing</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="4.199">would have exploded so they had a</text>
  <text start="104.43" dur="4.68">deflated a little bit to make everyone</text>
  <text start="107.219" dur="5.311">still believe that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery</text>
  <text start="109.11" dur="6.869">and they&amp;#39;re doing this to get this next</text>
  <text start="112.53" dur="5.4">event started and again in Europe what</text>
  <text start="115.979" dur="4.651">we&amp;#39;re seeing is unemployment continually</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="5.31">going up in the United States we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="5.129">seeing unemployment go down why because</text>
  <text start="123.24" dur="5.28">here they&amp;#39;ve changed the calculation</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="6.361">they really manipulated it to keep this</text>
  <text start="128.52" dur="6.09">illusion alive and again everything</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="4.619">they&amp;#39;re telling us is completely false</text>
  <text start="134.61" dur="3.87">and fake because it doesn&amp;#39;t match what</text>
  <text start="136.739" dur="4.231">we&amp;#39;re actually seeing with our eyes I</text>
  <text start="138.48" dur="4.89">mean we&amp;#39;re seeing retail stores closing</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re seeing real estate decline and</text>
  <text start="143.37" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re telling us more and more people</text>
  <text start="145.02" dur="6.45">are getting jobs and it doesn&amp;#39;t fit into</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="4.68">this model but out in France we have the</text>
  <text start="151.47" dur="4.29">president out there and he was telling</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="5.37">everyone that you know the French</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="5.01">economy is improving unemployment is</text>
  <text start="158.31" dur="4.53">going to be going down everything looks</text>
  <text start="160.77" dur="4.5">great and he kept this up going going</text>
  <text start="162.84" dur="5.58">going and now what we&amp;#39;re seeing and we</text>
  <text start="165.27" dur="5.28">saw this before unemployment is going up</text>
  <text start="168.42" dur="6">the number of people out of work in</text>
  <text start="170.55" dur="6.39">France surged in February by 31,500 to a</text>
  <text start="174.42" dur="4.35">new record level and again their</text>
  <text start="176.94" dur="3.6">unemployment rate is standing a 10.2</text>
  <text start="178.77" dur="4.17">percent and we&amp;#39;re going to continually</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="4.86">see this go higher we see the same thing</text>
  <text start="182.94" dur="5.19">in Greece the same thing in Spain in</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="4.92">Italy in Portugal it&amp;#39;s always the same</text>
  <text start="188.13" dur="4.47">thing oh don&amp;#39;t worry we see growth in</text>
  <text start="190.32" dur="4.56">the economy we see unemployment going</text>
  <text start="192.6" dur="4.14">down and especially when a moment there</text>
  <text start="194.88" dur="3.72">when it comes towards elections they</text>
  <text start="196.74" dur="4.23">really lay it on thick that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="198.6" dur="5.7">actually doing something and we know for</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="5.91">a fact all of this is a complete lie</text>
  <text start="204.3" dur="6.21">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="6.12">absolute opposite now in corporate media</text>
  <text start="210.51" dur="3.81">there they&amp;#39;ve been saying that um you</text>
  <text start="213" dur="3.57">know people have been dropping out of</text>
  <text start="214.32" dur="4.02">the labor market because you know</text>
  <text start="216.57" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;ve just given up there&amp;#39;s just you</text>
  <text start="218.34" dur="3.84">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of jobs out there but</text>
  <text start="219.87" dur="4.11">you know I don&amp;#39;t want to take one right</text>
  <text start="222.18" dur="3.93">now so I&amp;#39;m just giving up I mean does</text>
  <text start="223.98" dur="3.75">this make sense to anybody it makes no</text>
  <text start="226.11" dur="3.45">sense to me because this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.73" dur="3.84">trying to convince us of they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="229.56" dur="4.86">to convince us that these people who</text>
  <text start="231.57" dur="5.669">were on the extended unemployment which</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="4.349">ran out they don&amp;#39;t want to go for a job</text>
  <text start="237.239" dur="4.801">why because they&amp;#39;re just going to give</text>
  <text start="238.769" dur="5.581">up either so mine is so much employment</text>
  <text start="242.04" dur="4.05">out there that I don&amp;#39;t really want to do</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="3.24">it because I&amp;#39;m just giving up it makes</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="2.7">no sense so I&amp;#39;m just going to drop out</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="3.51">of the labor force and I&amp;#39;m just going to</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="4.919">sit here all day long it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="251.1" dur="6.03">in what they&amp;#39;re saying and the reason</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="7.111">people are actually giving up or not</text>
  <text start="257.13" dur="7.77">really giving up they can&amp;#39;t find the</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="6.56">work because it doesn&amp;#39;t exist and every</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="5.34">time and I&amp;#39;m talking to a lot of people</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="4.96">they put their resumes out there and</text>
  <text start="270.24" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;ve been speaking to a lot of college</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="5.52">graduates they push</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="7.59">their resumes out there they just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="6.42">find the work this is the problem those</text>
  <text start="282.03" dur="5.13">people who are working in their industry</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="4.44">for many years who got laid off put</text>
  <text start="287.16" dur="5.73">their resume out there they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="288.72" dur="7.11">no feedback back no one is contacting</text>
  <text start="292.89" dur="6.69">them they can&amp;#39;t find work and this is</text>
  <text start="295.83" dur="5.4">why they fall off the stats it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="4.08">because they&amp;#39;re just giving up because</text>
  <text start="301.23" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s so many jobs out there that is</text>
  <text start="303.66" dur="4.92">absolutely ridiculous and if you look</text>
  <text start="306" dur="4.14">most of the older generation are taking</text>
  <text start="308.58" dur="4.17">part time jobs right now and i did a</text>
  <text start="310.14" dur="4.23">report on this that that&amp;#39;s increasing</text>
  <text start="312.75" dur="4.17">and the teen jobs are actually</text>
  <text start="314.37" dur="5.69">decreasing because they can&amp;#39;t make ends</text>
  <text start="316.92" dur="6.36">meet with their retirement because</text>
  <text start="320.06" dur="5.56">inflation everything has gone up in</text>
  <text start="323.28" dur="4.74">price and their retirement money they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.62" dur="5.7">receiving is not enough to sustain them</text>
  <text start="328.02" dur="5.7">so they go back to work part-time to</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="5.13">keep up with what&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="333.72" dur="7.26">world and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="336.45" dur="6.87">and is that all programs are starting to</text>
  <text start="340.98" dur="4.68">get cut making it more difficult for</text>
  <text start="343.32" dur="4.62">people they cut the extended</text>
  <text start="345.66" dur="5.1">unemployment they cut food stamps and</text>
  <text start="347.94" dur="4.8">again in my other reports i reported</text>
  <text start="350.76" dur="5.909">that walmart their whole entire model</text>
  <text start="352.74" dur="6.3">was dependent on government money and</text>
  <text start="356.669" dur="5.341">now it&amp;#39;s come out that that&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="359.04" dur="4.68">true that they are dependent on</text>
  <text start="362.01" dur="6.44">government money and that is their</text>
  <text start="363.72" dur="8.69">business model and it was in their</text>
  <text start="368.45" dur="7.06">shareholders fax in their stock</text>
  <text start="372.41" dur="4.72">shareholder document and it was buried</text>
  <text start="375.51" dur="4.67">within the long list of risk factors</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="5.52">disclosed to its shareholders that is</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="4.03">outside of our control that could</text>
  <text start="382.65" dur="4.2">materially affect financial performance</text>
  <text start="384.21" dur="5.01">are these changes in the amount of</text>
  <text start="386.85" dur="4.62">payments made under the supplement</text>
  <text start="389.22" dur="5.19">nutrition assistant plan and other</text>
  <text start="391.47" dur="4.89">public assistance plans changes in the</text>
  <text start="394.41" dur="4.68">eligibility requirements of public</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="4.98">assistant plans walmart followers say</text>
  <text start="399.09" dur="4.889">this is the first time the company has</text>
  <text start="401.34" dur="5.94">made a disclosure like that that their</text>
  <text start="403.979" dur="4.111">model was dependent on government money</text>
  <text start="407.28" dur="2.16">now</text>
  <text start="408.09" dur="2.76">this crap that they were talking about</text>
  <text start="409.44" dur="5.22">in the beginning when they were saying</text>
  <text start="410.85" dur="6.09">oh you know it was the tax returns this</text>
  <text start="414.66" dur="5.039">is why sales are going down and you know</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="5.46">the food stamps that part was true but</text>
  <text start="419.699" dur="6.271">the main reason why stores are not doing</text>
  <text start="422.4" dur="5.94">well and people aren&amp;#39;t rushing in to buy</text>
  <text start="425.97" dur="5.55">more is because they don&amp;#39;t have work</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="6.359">they don&amp;#39;t have the disposable income to</text>
  <text start="431.52" dur="5.94">pay for what&amp;#39;s in the store because if</text>
  <text start="434.699" dur="5.28">the food stamp money dropped the people</text>
  <text start="437.46" dur="3.95">still need food they would buy with</text>
  <text start="439.979" dur="4.021">their own money but they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="441.41" dur="5.95">extra money to buy the food and this is</text>
  <text start="444" dur="6.24">why they&amp;#39;re setting up this a website</text>
  <text start="447.36" dur="5.73">that will help you compare prices all</text>
  <text start="450.24" dur="4.5">over the place with other supermarkets</text>
  <text start="453.09" dur="3.51">to compare it to walmart because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="3.929">trying to get people in to their</text>
  <text start="456.6" dur="4.2">supermarkets in Walmart because they</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="4.321">realize people will still have to buy</text>
  <text start="460.8" dur="4.14">food they might not buy the clothing</text>
  <text start="462.99" dur="3.75">they might not buy the electronics or</text>
  <text start="464.94" dur="3.81">the other doodads and goods that they</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="5.97">have in the store but they know they can</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="6.84">push the food at cheaper prices to push</text>
  <text start="472.71" dur="5.1">their earnings up because right now they</text>
  <text start="475.59" dur="5.37">are hurting because the American people</text>
  <text start="477.81" dur="5.31">are tapped out and that is what we are</text>
  <text start="480.96" dur="4.92">seeing right now now there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="483.12" dur="6.21">retail stores that are struggling right</text>
  <text start="485.88" dur="6.33">now toys r us they are struggling Levi</text>
  <text start="489.33" dur="5.459">Strauss they are struggling and they are</text>
  <text start="492.21" dur="5.79">laying off people Levi&amp;#39;s laying off a</text>
  <text start="494.789" dur="6.211">hundred people toys r us they&amp;#39;re laying</text>
  <text start="498" dur="5.58">off 500 people because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="501" dur="5.28">restructure the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="503.58" dur="5.73">well and this goes on to say that you</text>
  <text start="506.28" dur="5.46">know jeans maker Levi Strauss and toy</text>
  <text start="509.31" dur="5.279">store operator Toys R Us announced the</text>
  <text start="511.74" dur="6.62">planned layoffs after reporting weaker</text>
  <text start="514.589" dur="6.211">sales and again they tried price /</text>
  <text start="518.36" dur="5.559">slashing they tried all throughout the</text>
  <text start="520.8" dur="8.13">holidays but guess what their sales were</text>
  <text start="523.919" dur="8.011">weak even on their online systems they</text>
  <text start="528.93" dur="5.49">were weak so everything was weak across</text>
  <text start="531.93" dur="4.399">the board and this is why haven&amp;#39;t closed</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="6.27">stores yet they&amp;#39;re laying off people</text>
  <text start="536.329" dur="5.45">first now again if they were saying that</text>
  <text start="540.69" dur="3.22">people were going</text>
  <text start="541.779" dur="3.99">to online sales instead of</text>
  <text start="543.91" dur="3.989">brick-and-mortar we would have seen a</text>
  <text start="545.769" dur="4.8">switch from the brick-and-mortar to</text>
  <text start="547.899" dur="3.901">online sales in toys r us during the</text>
  <text start="550.569" dur="3.51">holiday season and that would have seen</text>
  <text start="551.8" dur="4.289">a huge increase which would have helped</text>
  <text start="554.079" dur="4.291">them out in the long run but guess what</text>
  <text start="556.089" dur="4.85">happened that didn&amp;#39;t happen and they are</text>
  <text start="558.37" dur="6.949">struggling now we&amp;#39;re also seeing a</text>
  <text start="560.939" dur="7">casino in and that is closing in</text>

  <text start="1432.13" dur="6.14">completely and I think they just kind of</text>
  <text start="1435.13" dur="6.06">screwed themselves over at this point</text>
  <text start="1438.27" dur="5.35">now President Obama was out there trying</text>
  <text start="1441.19" dur="5.07">to convince everyone that the the</text>

  <text start="1446.26" dur="5.49">worse than the Iraq invasion and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1449.38" dur="4.29">sitting here going whoa how could that</text>
  <text start="1451.75" dur="5.21">possibly be because if we really look at</text>
  <text start="1453.67" dur="6.03">it what happened there we see that</text>
  <text start="1456.96" dur="4.69">hundreds of thousands of people were</text>
  <text start="1459.7" dur="5.39">killed and it caused trillions of</text>

  <text start="1465.09" dur="9.58">Iraq now what do we see in Crimea</text>
  <text start="1470.25" dur="6.97">nothing no invasion no war didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1474.67" dur="7.11">cost anything and the people</text>
  <text start="1477.22" dur="8.339">voted hmm and the us-backed dictator of</text>
  <text start="1481.78" dur="5.61">Iraq now is Nouri al-maliki and he is</text>

  <text start="1487.39" dur="7.35">the country slips back into civil war</text>
  <text start="1489.9" dur="7.36">hmm so let&amp;#39;s say we have the u.s. puppet</text>
  <text start="1494.74" dur="4.74">government in Iraq fighting the people</text>
  <text start="1497.26" dur="3.72">of Iraq because the people of Iraq do</text>
  <text start="1499.48" dur="4.5">not agree with what happened they want</text>
  <text start="1500.98" dur="5.01">their country back and the president is</text>
  <text start="1503.98" dur="7.26">trying to convince the United States in</text>
  <text start="1505.99" dur="8.85">the world that the annexation of Crimea</text>
  <text start="1511.24" dur="6.99">was a lot worse well no one died in</text>
  <text start="1514.84" dur="6.839">Crimea there was no invasion with troops</text>
  <text start="1518.23" dur="7.17">the people voted that they wanted to be</text>
  <text start="1521.679" dur="6.63">a part of Russia we saw military men in</text>
  <text start="1525.4" dur="4.92">Ukrainian army decided to go over to the</text>
  <text start="1528.309" dur="4.461">Russian side if they didn&amp;#39;t want to they</text>
  <text start="1530.32" dur="5.63">were free to leave with their weapon and</text>
  <text start="1532.77" dur="6.039">we saw towns and other military</text>
  <text start="1535.95" dur="5.229">commanding officers also moved to the</text>
  <text start="1538.809" dur="6.661">Crimean side so how could this be</text>
  <text start="1541.179" dur="7.291">possibly worse it isn&amp;#39;t he&amp;#39;s making this</text>
  <text start="1545.47" dur="7.26">up think about it in Iraq in Lebanon in</text>
  <text start="1548.47" dur="8.069">Libya in Yemen the United States are</text>
  <text start="1552.73" dur="7.14">still in these countries flying drones</text>
  <text start="1556.539" dur="5.01">and bombing people who want their</text>
  <text start="1559.87" dur="3.929">country back and of course they call me</text>
  <text start="1561.549" dur="4.981">al Qaeda terrorists but really they are</text>
  <text start="1563.799" dur="4.951">people who want their country back the</text>
  <text start="1566.53" dur="5.009">only reason the United States went into</text>
  <text start="1568.75" dur="7.409">these countries was to take what they</text>
  <text start="1571.539" dur="6.241">had put it on the US dollar and put a</text>
  <text start="1576.159" dur="2.911">private western central bank in that</text>
  <text start="1577.78" dur="3.12">country because if you look at each one</text>
  <text start="1579.07" dur="4.8">of these countries they were selling</text>
  <text start="1580.9" dur="5.22">their oil not using the US dollar and</text>
  <text start="1583.87" dur="4.38">again we&amp;#39;ve made it worse hundreds of</text>
  <text start="1586.12" dur="4.47">thousands of people have died people are</text>
  <text start="1588.25" dur="6.96">suffering suffering the country is in</text>
  <text start="1590.59" dur="8.91">debt so this is not better it is</text>
  <text start="1595.21" dur="6.54">actually worse now we understand that</text>
  <text start="1599.5" dur="5.22">most of Ukrainian warships have moved</text>
  <text start="1601.75" dur="5.64">over to Russia and right now and this is</text>
  <text start="1604.72" dur="5.04">about 30 warships and right now the</text>
  <text start="1607.39" dur="3.659">Ukrainian Navy could enter into Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1609.76" dur="3.509">Black Sea Fleet by</text>
  <text start="1611.049" dur="4.771">the end of the year but only after they</text>
  <text start="1613.269" dur="4.081">pass inspection and ships that were</text>
  <text start="1615.82" dur="3.66">selling previously under the ukrainian</text>
  <text start="1617.35" dur="4.11">flag will not be automatically included</text>
  <text start="1619.48" dur="5.039">in the black sea fleet until they have</text>
  <text start="1621.46" dur="5.039">undergone a technical evaluation and</text>
  <text start="1624.519" dur="4.051">they can decide which ships will enter</text>
  <text start="1626.499" dur="4.41">the fleet and which ones will be</text>
  <text start="1628.57" dur="4.77">scrapped at this point so it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="1630.909" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s an automatic thing where oh look we</text>
  <text start="1633.34" dur="3.089">took their fleet now we&amp;#39;re going to all</text>
  <text start="1634.749" dur="3.63">use it they&amp;#39;re looking at the ships if</text>
  <text start="1636.429" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re old they can&amp;#39;t be used or going</text>
  <text start="1638.379" dur="3.061">to be scrapped and the other ones are</text>
  <text start="1639.879" dur="3.211">going to be inspected so it&amp;#39;s not an</text>
  <text start="1641.44" dur="3.569">automatic oh let&amp;#39;s just use them for</text>
  <text start="1643.09" dur="3.959">battle to invade the rest of Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1645.009" dur="4.201">that is not what&amp;#39;s happening and if we</text>
  <text start="1647.049" dur="5.22">look at what&amp;#39;s happening with Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="1649.21" dur="8.039">military out of the 18,000 Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="1652.269" dur="8.01">military less than fifteen percent chose</text>
  <text start="1657.249" dur="7.201">to leave the rest went over to Crimea</text>
  <text start="1660.279" dur="6.9">and Russia now we hear a lot of</text>
  <text start="1664.45" dur="5.339">propaganda out there about the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="1667.179" dur="4.74">about the the corporate media who was</text>

  <text start="1686.649" dur="6.39">well the Pentagon sees no evidence</text>
  <text start="1689.409" dur="5.821">whatsoever whatsoever that Russian</text>
  <text start="1693.039" dur="4.921">forces on Ukraine border are conducting</text>
  <text start="1695.23" dur="4.559">exercises as many as a hundred thousand</text>

  <text start="1703.989" dur="5.13">there hasn&amp;#39;t been any proof of that and</text>
  <text start="1706.359" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re not really worried at this time</text>
  <text start="1709.119" dur="4.201">of what&amp;#39;s going on there and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1711.879" dur="3.27">and this is coming from the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="1713.32" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;ve seen no specific indication that</text>

  <text start="1717.22" dur="10.5">defense minister show goo or assurances</text>
  <text start="1723.73" dur="6.569">only and again they&amp;#39;re not really seeing</text>
  <text start="1727.72" dur="5.61">what is being reported because it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1730.299" dur="5.76">actually happening Russia is not moving</text>
  <text start="1733.33" dur="5.159">into Ukraine with mass military forces</text>
  <text start="1736.059" dur="4.261">they&amp;#39;re not taking it over if they were</text>
  <text start="1738.489" dur="3.78">going to do it they would have just done</text>
  <text start="1740.32" dur="3.6">it they would just trampled everyone and</text>
  <text start="1742.269" dur="3.391">they would have gone in there</text>
  <text start="1743.92" dur="4.02">taken over Ukraine but if you look at</text>
  <text start="1745.66" dur="4.95">the actions of Putin this is not how he</text>
  <text start="1747.94" dur="4.77">works he doesn&amp;#39;t just move in he could</text>
  <text start="1750.61" dur="4.53">have just done it in Syria he could have</text>
  <text start="1752.71" dur="4.29">just let United States move into Syria</text>
  <text start="1755.14" dur="4.95">it would have given him every</text>
  <text start="1757" dur="5.22">opportunity to win help Syrian bring in</text>
  <text start="1760.09" dur="4.68">Russian forces and start World War three</text>
  <text start="1762.22" dur="4.47">if you really look at it the only people</text>
  <text start="1764.77" dur="4.11">that are talking war or the United</text>
  <text start="1766.69" dur="4.8">States are the lawmakers in the United</text>
  <text start="1768.88" dur="6.21">States the Ukrainian acting government</text>
  <text start="1771.49" dur="6.36">these are the only at European nations</text>
  <text start="1775.09" dur="4.44">NATO they are the ones who are talking</text>
  <text start="1777.85" dur="3.75">more beating their chests saying we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1779.53" dur="4.1">going to war we&amp;#39;re going to war we are</text>
  <text start="1781.6" dur="6.99">not seeing this from any other source</text>
  <text start="1783.63" dur="7.99">except that now we understand that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1788.59" dur="5.01">in Africa and the United States as you</text>
  <text start="1791.62" dur="3.69">know brought troops into Africa and</text>
  <text start="1793.6" dur="4.67">they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1795.31" dur="5.85">there because of the the incident in</text>

  <text start="1801.16" dur="6.12">right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a huge</text>
  <text start="1803.77" dur="5.46">buildup of more and more troops moving</text>
  <text start="1807.28" dur="5.81">into Africa and we know why this is</text>
  <text start="1809.23" dur="8.55">happening because China has set up a</text>
  <text start="1813.09" dur="7.24">clearinghouse in Kenya and we understand</text>

  <text start="1849.52" dur="6.21">cannot have this happen and right now</text>
  <text start="1852.22" dur="6.78">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the actual build up</text>

  <text start="2160.32" dur="4.049">as President Obama correctly noted our</text>
  <text start="2162.66" dur="4.169">biggest fear is a nuclear weapon going</text>
