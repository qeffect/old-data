  <text start="135.56" dur="6.81">and they started to arrest certain</text>
  <text start="138.47" dur="6.08">individuals and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="142.37" dur="4.67">people are standing up and saying no</text>
  <text start="144.55" dur="5.26">hundreds of thousands of people about</text>

  <text start="164.3" dur="5.13">Catalonian government and we see right</text>
  <text start="167.03" dur="5.039">now that the people they&amp;#39;re marching in</text>

  <text start="185" dur="3.85">trying to suppress</text>
  <text start="186.33" dur="4.74">all of this and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="188.85" dur="4.83">this moves forward because as we can see</text>
  <text start="191.07" dur="4.68">the people are speaking up and people</text>
  <text start="193.68" dur="4.8">are coming out numbers to show their</text>
  <text start="195.75" dur="4.23">support for what is going on here in the</text>
  <text start="198.48" dur="4.98">United States we can see the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="199.98" dur="6.42">branding art t&amp;#39;s a foreign agent now art</text>
  <text start="203.46" dur="6.39">T America is a us-based subsidiary of</text>
  <text start="206.4" dur="6.72">art T and the United States came out and</text>
  <text start="209.85" dur="5.1">they registered RT as a foreign engine</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="6.99">under the foreign agents Registration</text>
  <text start="214.95" dur="7.59">Act now when looking at this we can see</text>
  <text start="220.11" dur="5.64">that the Cabal is putting a lot of</text>
  <text start="222.54" dur="5.55">pressure on Russia and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="225.75" dur="4.92">make Russia counter every single move</text>
  <text start="228.09" dur="5.55">now the Justice Department demand that</text>
  <text start="230.67" dur="5.7">RT register as a foreign agent is aimed</text>
  <text start="233.64" dur="5.67">at deal again amazing RT as a news</text>
  <text start="236.37" dur="4.86">source intimidating its journalists and</text>
  <text start="239.31" dur="4.08">guests and setting the precedent for</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="4.95">taking similar actions against other</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="5.1">news outlets now the US government</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;ve given no public justification</text>
  <text start="248.49" dur="5.04">for its demand and right now we can see</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="4.56">that they are pushing this agenda what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="4.139">very interesting is that the US has made</text>
  <text start="255.84" dur="4.14">no similar demand in relation to other</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="4.951">outlets that have other government</text>
  <text start="259.98" dur="5.22">financing and backing like in the BBC</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="3.36">for example they haven&amp;#39;t said anything</text>
  <text start="265.2" dur="2.7">about that</text>
  <text start="265.98" dur="4.35">the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this is</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="5.519">they&amp;#39;re putting pressure on Russia</text>
  <text start="270.33" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re provoking Russia and we can see</text>
  <text start="273.419" dur="4.621">that this is all coming from an</text>
  <text start="275.64" dur="3.99">organization calling itself the European</text>
  <text start="278.04" dur="4.11">values think tank based in Czech</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="4.35">Republic and funded by the u.s. embassy</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="4.8">and foundations associated with the</text>
  <text start="283.98" dur="6.62">billionaire George Soros published a</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="7.469">list of different news organizations</text>
  <text start="290.6" dur="6.76">different names around the world that</text>
  <text start="294.419" dur="6.691">should be registered as foreign agents</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="5.43">or their hostile foreign powers and they</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="6.6">published a list including names of</text>
  <text start="302.79" dur="7.91">about 2,300 arty guests and some of them</text>
  <text start="307.71" dur="6.45">are Julian Assange max Blumenthal</text>
  <text start="310.7" dur="8.939">Seymour Hersh Jeremy Scahill</text>
  <text start="314.16" dur="7.009">ed Schultz Matt Taibbi and many others</text>
  <text start="319.639" dur="4.171">and they&amp;#39;re going down list even Russell</text>
  <text start="321.169" dur="4.411">Brand Oliver Stone I mean they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="323.81" dur="5.189">making up this list saying yeah all</text>
  <text start="325.58" dur="6.329">these individuals are hostile foreign</text>
  <text start="328.999" dur="5.581">powers these news organizations that</text>
  <text start="331.909" dur="4.62">they work for should be foreign agents</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="3.54">and we can see that they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="336.529" dur="4.11">their agenda very very hard now again</text>
  <text start="338.12" dur="5.009">this is going to be a very difficult</text>
  <text start="340.639" dur="6.451">thing to continually push because this</text>
  <text start="343.129" dur="6.331">hits against free speech and we can see</text>
  <text start="347.09" dur="3.81">that this is going to be a major problem</text>
  <text start="349.46" dur="3.479">here now of course we know why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="4.41">doing this because they&amp;#39;re still trying</text>
  <text start="352.939" dur="6.38">to push their event we see French</text>
  <text start="355.31" dur="8.19">President Ma Kron he is asking for a</text>
  <text start="359.319" dur="6.4">revised Iran nuclear deal and we can see</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="4.289">that the p5 plus 1 deal</text>
  <text start="365.719" dur="4.2">looks like countries are coming out now</text>
  <text start="367.789" dur="4.261">saying listen we need to revise this</text>
  <text start="369.919" dur="5.61">plan now you have to remember why this</text>
  <text start="372.05" dur="6.149">plan was created remember they kept on</text>
  <text start="375.529" dur="5.91">saying that Iran was in the process of</text>
  <text start="378.199" dur="6.06">creating a nuclear weapon now the United</text>
  <text start="381.439" dur="4.41">States the Kabam after Syria they were</text>
  <text start="384.259" dur="5.071">gonna go into Iran and have regime</text>
  <text start="385.849" dur="6.18">change if Iran was a nuclear power this</text>
  <text start="389.33" dur="6.059">would be impossible so they needed a way</text>
  <text start="392.029" dur="5.281">to make sure that Iran didn&amp;#39;t become a</text>
  <text start="395.389" dur="3.721">nuclear power and I&amp;#39;m when I say nuclear</text>
  <text start="397.31" dur="4.409">power I mean where they didn&amp;#39;t create</text>
  <text start="399.11" dur="4.32">nuclear weapons so they came up with</text>
  <text start="401.719" dur="3.841">this plan and made sure that they</text>
  <text start="403.43" dur="4.56">couldn&amp;#39;t do this if they couldn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="5.159">then it would be easier to invade and</text>
  <text start="407.99" dur="4.859">have regime change and now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.719" dur="4.38">seeing is that all these checks and</text>
  <text start="412.849" dur="5.13">balances well it&amp;#39;s making it difficult</text>
  <text start="415.099" dur="4.141">to start a war with Iran because you</text>
  <text start="417.979" dur="2.22">know with North Korea they can sit with</text>
  <text start="419.24" dur="2.159">they&amp;#39;re developing a nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="420.199" dur="3.631">they&amp;#39;re gonna destroy us</text>
  <text start="421.399" dur="6.121">well Iran is not creating any nuclear</text>
  <text start="423.83" dur="5.22">weapon so they can&amp;#39;t use it to say that</text>
  <text start="427.52" dur="3.419">they&amp;#39;re gonna start a war or do</text>
  <text start="429.05" dur="3.51">something they can&amp;#39;t go into the country</text>
  <text start="430.939" dur="2.7">because they&amp;#39;re creating a nuclear</text>
  <text start="432.56" dur="3.719">weapon because they&amp;#39;re checked by the</text>
  <text start="433.639" dur="5.49">IAEA and they&amp;#39;re saying that everything</text>
  <text start="436.279" dur="5.31">is fantastic and we see right now the</text>
  <text start="439.129" dur="3.991">leaders out there well they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="441.589" dur="3.871">who came up with the deal now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="443.12" dur="4.62">going back on the deal because we can</text>
  <text start="445.46" dur="5.28">see what&amp;#39;s happening the Cabal they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="5.64">stuck they need a war to break out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.74" dur="5.55">either with Iran it&amp;#39;s with Ukraine with</text>
  <text start="453.38" dur="5.31">Syria with North Korea Venezuela maybe</text>
  <text start="456.29" dur="3.84">anywhere they possibly can do this this</text>
  <text start="458.69" dur="3.69">is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do Russia</text>
  <text start="460.13" dur="4.47">China they didn&amp;#39;t fall for it</text>
  <text start="462.38" dur="3.87">they tried with them it&amp;#39;s not working</text>
  <text start="464.6" dur="3.45">that Putin doesn&amp;#39;t work that way Xi</text>
  <text start="466.25" dur="3.39">Jinping does not work that way but</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="2.88">they&amp;#39;re noticing that they can do this</text>
  <text start="469.64" dur="3.48">with other nations and it&amp;#39;s becoming</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="4.41">very very difficult because Iran they</text>
  <text start="473.12" dur="4.89">haven&amp;#39;t started a war in over 200 years</text>
  <text start="475.34" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re not gonna start one now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="478.01" dur="4.29">in their interest to start a war but we</text>
  <text start="480.98" dur="3.36">can see the Arab League right now</text>
  <text start="482.3" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re set to hold an emergency meeting</text>
  <text start="484.34" dur="5.79">on Iran at Saudi Arabia&amp;#39;s request the</text>
  <text start="487.94" dur="4.26">Kingdom has mobilized its f-15 fighter</text>
  <text start="490.13" dur="3.8">jet fleet to launch a military operation</text>
  <text start="492.2" dur="5.37">against the Iranian backed terrorist</text>
  <text start="493.93" dur="5.47">militia of Hezbollah in Lebanon and we</text>
  <text start="497.57" dur="6.09">can see that they&amp;#39;re using Lebanon right</text>
  <text start="499.4" dur="6.57">now as a proxy to get into war with Iran</text>
  <text start="503.66" dur="5.22">this is the whole plan now think about</text>
  <text start="505.97" dur="5.37">it the civil war in Yemen going nowhere</text>
  <text start="508.88" dur="5.58">Saudi Arabia they can&amp;#39;t get anywhere in</text>
  <text start="511.34" dur="6.15">Yemen and they understand this we see</text>
  <text start="514.46" dur="5.12">guitar economic blockade well that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="517.49" dur="6.179">working guitar is moving closer to Iran</text>
  <text start="519.58" dur="7.72">Yemen is closer to Iran Russia is</text>
  <text start="523.669" dur="6.421">backing up these countries we see the</text>
  <text start="527.3" dur="4.38">latest civil unrest in Baja rain and the</text>
  <text start="530.09" dur="4.92">alleged bombing of a major oil pipeline</text>
  <text start="531.68" dur="5.16">there is also another problem and when</text>
  <text start="535.01" dur="3.99">we look at this we can see that yeah all</text>
  <text start="536.84" dur="3.9">of this and you add it all up you can</text>
  <text start="539" dur="4.86">see they are stuck they have no other</text>
  <text start="540.74" dur="6.69">place to go at this point the paid</text>
  <text start="543.86" dur="6.77">mercenaries in Syria they&amp;#39;re done for so</text>
  <text start="547.43" dur="5.46">this Israeli TV channel 10 they</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="5.56">uncovered these secret documents and</text>
  <text start="552.89" dur="8.49">they made them public and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="556.19" dur="9.24">that the whole entire plan to provoke</text>
  <text start="561.38" dur="6.69">war in Lebanon is coordinated with Saudi</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="6">Arabia and Israel to instigate a new</text>
  <text start="568.07" dur="8.55">Middle East war and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="571.43" dur="8.19">is they&amp;#39;re going to vilify Iran and use</text>
  <text start="576.62" dur="5.28">Lebanon to get into Iran so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="579.62" dur="3.99">seeing right now is Israel and other</text>
  <text start="581.9" dur="3.27">countries had this huge military</text>
  <text start="583.61" dur="3.9">exercise</text>
  <text start="585.17" dur="4.83">and they had a lot of different</text>
  <text start="587.51" dur="4.11">countries involved in it and back in</text>
  <text start="590" dur="3.69">September they also simulated an</text>
  <text start="591.62" dur="3.6">invasion of Lebanon designed</text>
  <text start="593.69" dur="4.53">specifically to target the Lebanese</text>
  <text start="595.22" dur="6.359">group Hezbollah and we see at this point</text>
  <text start="598.22" dur="5.729">this was all being done because this was</text>
  <text start="601.579" dur="5.82">part of their plan now the cable was</text>
  <text start="603.949" dur="5.791">leaked by Barak Ravid senior diplomatic</text>

  <text start="706.76" dur="7.16">last July and this is a good deal and</text>
  <text start="710.089" dur="7.411">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that US Russia</text>
  <text start="713.92" dur="4.96">their statement on Syria well it took</text>
  <text start="717.5" dur="2.85">months of prep</text>
  <text start="718.88" dur="3.72">this is not something that they came up</text>
  <text start="720.35" dur="5.37">with yesterday and they said oh here we</text>

  <text start="725.72" dur="5.88">the United States they&amp;#39;ve been working</text>
  <text start="728.63" dur="5.91">very very closely to come up with a deal</text>
  <text start="731.6" dur="5.1">in Syria and Trump actually tweeted out</text>
  <text start="734.54" dur="3.75">you know when all the haters and fools</text>
  <text start="736.7" dur="3">out there realized that having a good</text>
  <text start="738.29" dur="3.72">relationship with Russia is a good thing</text>
  <text start="739.7" dur="4.77">not a bad thing they&amp;#39;re always playing</text>

  <text start="755.78" dur="5.49">that paid mercenaries and Russia can</text>
  <text start="758.72" dur="6">help with this situation because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="761.27" dur="6.39">very difficult for Trump to maneuver and</text>
  <text start="764.72" dur="5.16">to go after the Cabal right now because</text>
  <text start="767.66" dur="4.35">there are too many different operatives</text>
  <text start="769.88" dur="4.89">within the government that are stopping</text>
  <text start="772.01" dur="4.68">him so he&amp;#39;s been working with Russia and</text>

  <text start="803.42" dur="5.04">the army of the United States this is</text>
  <text start="805.88" dur="5.94">what the Cabal uses to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="808.46" dur="5.79">across the world and Trump says the US</text>
  <text start="811.82" dur="6.24">needs to team up with Russia to solve</text>
  <text start="814.25" dur="6.27">these global issues and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
