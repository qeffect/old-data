  <text start="136.079" dur="4.651">they possibly can and bring in the funds</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="5.94">because they do have payments coming up</text>
  <text start="140.73" dur="7.59">they were tackling the pensions and it</text>
  <text start="144.69" dur="6.96">seems there is trouble in Greece right</text>

  <text start="151.65" dur="4.619">running out of money and what is</text>
  <text start="154.14" dur="5.129">happening is there was a glitch in their</text>
  <text start="156.269" dur="4.051">ATM system and people couldn&amp;#39;t get their</text>
  <text start="159.269" dur="2.31">money out they couldn&amp;#39;t get to their</text>

  <text start="161.579" dur="2.461">pension payment they couldn&amp;#39;t get to it</text>
  <text start="163.199" dur="3.841">and it</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="6.569">on 48 hours or so and I said it was a</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="5.52">technical glitch and the people are now</text>
  <text start="170.609" dur="4.321">panicking because they&amp;#39;re worried that</text>
  <text start="172.56" dur="6.959">their money is not going to be there and</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="7.199">a lot of the pensioners are in line</text>
  <text start="179.519" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re not just going there to take out</text>
  <text start="182.129" dur="4.801">there one payment they&amp;#39;re actually going</text>
  <text start="184.019" dur="6.03">in and they&amp;#39;re taking out all of their</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="7.259">money and people are getting very very</text>
  <text start="190.049" dur="7.621">nervous and this is not helping that the</text>
  <text start="194.189" dur="8.22">80s ATM systems were not working we see</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="6.959">so Turia gelatine e75 a former civil</text>
  <text start="202.409" dur="3.75">servant said normally I only would draw</text>
  <text start="204.629" dur="4.53">half the money at the end of the month</text>
  <text start="206.159" dur="5.55">but today I&amp;#39;m taking every last drop of</text>
  <text start="209.159" dur="4.5">it there are so many rumors going around</text>
  <text start="211.709" dur="6">we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s really going on and</text>
  <text start="213.659" dur="6.061">we are very very nervous and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="4.23">blame them we saw what happened in</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="5.129">Cyprus when things started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="221.939" dur="4.651">and all of a sudden the banks were shut</text>
  <text start="224.849" dur="3.81">down their own bank holiday people woke</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="5.19">up on Saturday they couldn&amp;#39;t get their</text>
  <text start="228.659" dur="5.61">money out and this went on for over a</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="6.599">year and we can see right now the people</text>
  <text start="234.269" dur="6">are very very nervous about this and we</text>
  <text start="238.379" dur="2.97">can see that most of them now are going</text>
  <text start="240.269" dur="3.451">to the bank they&amp;#39;re standing on line</text>
  <text start="241.349" dur="5.551">there want they want their money and</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re going to take it out and this is</text>
  <text start="246.9" dur="4.199">going to be a major problem because the</text>
  <text start="249.15" dur="4.53">government was going after a lot of the</text>
  <text start="251.099" dur="4.17">pensions going a lot you know after a</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="4.619">lot of the money because they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="255.269" dur="5.22">to build up as much as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="4.771">to make the next payment and they are</text>
  <text start="260.489" dur="5.191">still short and it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="263.07" dur="3.629">harder for them to do this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="2.37">going to have to watch to see what</text>
  <text start="266.699" dur="5.061">happens a lot of people are talking</text>
  <text start="268.05" dur="6.299">about Greece exiting at this point and</text>
  <text start="271.76" dur="4.18">from all the indicators and from</text>
  <text start="274.349" dur="3.511">everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing it does</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="5.46">look like they&amp;#39;re heading down this path</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="6.33">now here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="5.519">understand things are getting tougher</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="4.74">and tougher out in the real world and</text>
  <text start="286.919" dur="3.571">I&amp;#39;m not talking about the illusionary</text>
  <text start="288.93" dur="4.02">world of the government with</text>
  <text start="290.49" dur="5.609">unemployment at five point five percent</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="4.87">there&amp;#39;s no inflation retail sales look</text>
  <text start="296.099" dur="4.391">great home sales look front</text>
  <text start="297.82" dur="5.67">think when we look at what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="5.07">going on we see that things are starting</text>
  <text start="303.49" dur="4.74">to break down yes there are still people</text>
  <text start="305.56" dur="5.58">that have work there are still people</text>
  <text start="308.23" dur="6.9">that have jobs and they&amp;#39;re still making</text>
  <text start="311.14" dur="7.56">money and they don&amp;#39;t see that anything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.13" dur="5.4">the problem this happened prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="318.7" dur="3.92">I mean a lot of people had great paying</text>
  <text start="320.53" dur="5.1">jobs and then all of a sudden one day</text>
  <text start="322.62" dur="5.11">you were laid off and then more people</text>
  <text start="325.63" dur="3.86">were laid off and then more people laid</text>
  <text start="327.73" dur="6.06">off this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="329.49" dur="7.63">we&amp;#39;re seeing many many companies a lot</text>
  <text start="333.79" dur="5.91">of retail a lot of corporations desk</text>
  <text start="337.12" dur="4.8">jobs being laid off at this point in</text>
  <text start="339.7" dur="4.83">time and it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder</text>
  <text start="341.92" dur="6.75">for people to make it we see right now</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="8.46">one in for us renters must use half of</text>
  <text start="348.67" dur="6.33">their pay for their housing costs this</text>
  <text start="352.99" dur="4.7">is very tough on a family because what</text>
  <text start="355" dur="5.85">happens is as rents continually rise and</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="5.08">wages decrease it gets harder and harder</text>
  <text start="360.85" dur="3.75">to make it through the month and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.77" dur="4.5">starting to see that a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="364.6" dur="4.56">only making it to 21 days let me just</text>
  <text start="367.27" dur="5.58">say it&amp;#39;s hard for me I have four</text>
  <text start="369.16" dur="6.39">children and I do not leave live outside</text>
  <text start="372.85" dur="4.98">of my means I have very small payments</text>
  <text start="375.55" dur="4.32">right now I&amp;#39;m just like everyone else</text>
  <text start="377.83" dur="6.36">you still have a little bit of debt here</text>
  <text start="379.87" dur="6.87">you still have taxes to pay and as every</text>
  <text start="384.19" dur="5.48">day goes by I see food is getting more</text>
  <text start="386.74" dur="7.38">expensive it&amp;#39;s costing me more and more</text>
  <text start="389.67" dur="7.99">electric is going up auto insurance is</text>
  <text start="394.12" dur="6.66">going up and as these things go up the</text>
  <text start="397.66" dur="5.34">income coming in is not and it&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="400.78" dur="4.08">it very difficult to survive and we can</text>
  <text start="403" dur="6.51">see right now that this is affecting</text>
  <text start="404.86" dur="6.6">many people across the country we see</text>
  <text start="409.51" dur="4.02">that the census data by the Enterprise</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="4.11">Community Partners a nonprofit that</text>
  <text start="413.53" dur="4.65">helps finance affordable housing the</text>
  <text start="415.57" dur="5.01">number of household has jumped from</text>
  <text start="418.18" dur="6.96">twenty six percent to 11.25 million</text>
  <text start="420.58" dur="7.89">since 2007 a sign of how surging rents</text>
  <text start="425.14" dur="6.029">have outpaced the US wages in recent</text>
  <text start="428.47" dur="5.039">years the government defines housing</text>
  <text start="431.169" dur="6.15">in excess of thirty percent of income as</text>
  <text start="433.509" dur="7.321">burdensome it means making really</text>
  <text start="437.319" dur="6.361">difficult trade-offs I mean do you buy</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="6.48">food or do you pay for your rent right</text>
  <text start="443.68" dur="6.479">now as a result 2.3 million more</text>
  <text start="447.31" dur="8.009">families face pressure that leave them</text>
  <text start="450.159" dur="7.62">very close to being homeless and people</text>
  <text start="455.319" dur="7.051">in California Florida New Jersey New</text>
  <text start="457.779" dur="7.98">York at least half of their incomes are</text>
  <text start="462.37" dur="5.19">going to housing and utility which means</text>
  <text start="465.759" dur="4.74">the other half has to go to everything</text>
  <text start="467.56" dur="6.93">else and usually it&amp;#39;s not enough to get</text>
  <text start="470.499" dur="6.271">them through and we can see once you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.49" dur="5.28">in that age bracket where you retire and</text>
  <text start="476.77" dur="6.09">you get older we&amp;#39;re seeing it&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="479.77" dur="4.56">worse for those people a new report</text>
  <text start="482.86" dur="3.959">looked at the financial health of</text>
  <text start="484.33" dur="6.059">Americans at the end of their lives and</text>
  <text start="486.819" dur="7.171">found that over twenty percent had no</text>
  <text start="490.389" dur="7.321">assets except for their homes and 12%</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="7.139">had no assets left at all they were just</text>
  <text start="497.71" dur="5.759">completely sucked away they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="501.129" dur="5.03">completely out of it boom they&amp;#39;re done</text>
  <text start="503.469" dur="4.771">they made it to the end and that was it</text>
  <text start="506.159" dur="5.141">some of them didn&amp;#39;t even make it that</text>
  <text start="508.24" dur="5.489">far the report found that one in five</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="5.489">Americans who died at the age of 85 and</text>
  <text start="513.729" dur="6.031">older between 2010 and 2012 had no</text>
  <text start="516.789" dur="4.471">assets except for their home now this</text>
  <text start="519.76" dur="3.99">didn&amp;#39;t help them because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="4.59">sell their home they lived in their home</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="5.55">they paid whatever taxes they had and</text>
  <text start="525.85" dur="5.729">then they passed away the families might</text>
  <text start="529.3" dur="4.409">have sold the home and you know the</text>
  <text start="531.579" dur="5.76">profits from the home but those people</text>
  <text start="533.709" dur="6.36">just lived every single day paycheck or</text>
  <text start="537.339" dur="6.421">whatever retirement paycheck to paycheck</text>
  <text start="540.069" dur="6.091">and just barely survived those who died</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="6.42">at a younger age between the ages of 50</text>
  <text start="546.16" dur="6.27">and 64 were generally worse off and we</text>
  <text start="550.18" dur="5.459">can see that it is not getting better in</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="6.05">the economy whatsoever I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.639" dur="6.871">looking at auto sales right now and</text>
  <text start="558.48" dur="5.919">basically it has missed for the fifth</text>
  <text start="562.51" dur="2.66">month in a row worst year-to-date</text>
  <text start="564.399" dur="6.201">performance</text>
  <text start="565.17" dur="8.13">since 2009 what is this telling us this</text>
  <text start="570.6" dur="4.41">is telling us that all the programs that</text>
  <text start="573.3" dur="3.21">they have implemented where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="575.01" dur="5.069">bringing in the subprime people those</text>
  <text start="576.51" dur="6.72">people have a heartbeat they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="580.079" dur="6.781">they can&amp;#39;t find any more people they</text>
  <text start="583.23" dur="6.69">can&amp;#39;t give loans away to get these</text>
  <text start="586.86" dur="4.56">people to purchase the cars and again</text>
  <text start="589.92" dur="3.96">these cars aren&amp;#39;t really purchase their</text>
  <text start="591.42" dur="5.94">least they&amp;#39;re financed and a lot of them</text>
  <text start="593.88" dur="6">are being repossessed because these</text>
  <text start="597.36" dur="4.5">subprime people who can barely afford to</text>
  <text start="599.88" dur="4.53">live in their rentals they can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="601.86" dur="4.14">their cars and a time goes on the</text>
  <text start="604.41" dur="4.41">repossessed and that&amp;#39;s why we see the</text>
  <text start="606" dur="5.67">delinquency rate at eighty percent we</text>
  <text start="608.82" dur="6.389">see april&amp;#39;s manufacturing PMI printed a</text>

  <text start="627.42" dur="4.77">expectations and has not risen for five</text>
  <text start="630.329" dur="5.07">months and we know that manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="632.19" dur="6.93">completely falling apart we see</text>
  <text start="635.399" dur="6.63">construction spending plunged 0.6% they</text>

  <text start="658.8" dur="4.74">everything they did the pump this up is</text>
  <text start="661.04" dur="5.44">starting to give way at this time we see</text>
  <text start="663.54" dur="5.549">the Baltic Dry Index and is dropped once</text>
  <text start="666.48" dur="4.77">again to 587 down four points this is</text>
