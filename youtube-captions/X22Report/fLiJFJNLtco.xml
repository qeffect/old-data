  <text start="103.36" dur="5.399">toll on the younger generation and the</text>
  <text start="106.119" dur="4.381">younger generation is needed for the</text>
  <text start="108.759" dur="4.14">economy to survive I mean if we take a</text>
  <text start="110.5" dur="6.21">look at Greece we can see that the youth</text>
  <text start="112.899" dur="5.311">unemployment it is around 40% or higher</text>
  <text start="116.71" dur="3.69">depending on which time you look at it</text>
  <text start="118.21" dur="4.199">and what that means is these individuals</text>
  <text start="120.4" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re not getting jobs they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="122.409" dur="3.601">saving money they&amp;#39;re not going out and</text>
  <text start="124.42" dur="4.14">spending in retail they&amp;#39;re not going out</text>
  <text start="126.01" dur="5.1">and spending on homes and this is a</text>
  <text start="128.56" dur="4.95">major problem now here in the United</text>
  <text start="131.11" dur="4.83">States and around the world we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="133.51" dur="4.259">the same exact thing this hasn&amp;#39;t gone</text>
  <text start="135.94" dur="5.34">away the central bankers remember their</text>
  <text start="137.769" dur="6.841">system it&amp;#39;s not developed to spur</text>
  <text start="141.28" dur="6.239">economic growth it is developed to</text>
  <text start="144.61" dur="7.5">siphon the wealth from the middle class</text>
  <text start="147.519" dur="9.301">the poor the wealthy yes even the</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="7.86">wealthy up to that 1% who are on the top</text>
  <text start="156.82" dur="5.639">level and all of its siphoned all the</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="5.64">way to the top and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="162.459" dur="5.551">is actually really happening right now</text>
  <text start="165.61" dur="3.719">this is not a conspiracy theory where</text>
  <text start="168.01" dur="2.37">people are just talking about it because</text>
  <text start="169.329" dur="3.981">we could see the middle class is</text>
  <text start="170.38" dur="5.1">completely disappearing the poor</text>
  <text start="173.31" dur="4.48">individuals well they need the</text>
  <text start="175.48" dur="4.71">entitlement programs and we can see that</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="4.47">of course Mark Zuckerberg right now is</text>
  <text start="180.19" dur="4.109">talking about universal basic income for</text>
  <text start="182.26" dur="3.13">everyone which means the government is</text>
  <text start="184.299" dur="4.301">just going to hand out my</text>
  <text start="185.39" dur="5.7">to keep everyone quiet as the system</text>
  <text start="188.6" dur="5.19">breaks down because during the Great</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="5.13">Recession what did you see so soup lines</text>
  <text start="193.79" dur="5.01">you saw bread lines your piece or people</text>
  <text start="196.22" dur="4.95">roaming the country looking for work and</text>
  <text start="198.8" dur="4.65">you saw people sleeping on the streets</text>
  <text start="201.17" dur="5.039">they don&amp;#39;t want that they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="203.45" dur="4.77">anyone seeing any of this type of stuff</text>
  <text start="206.209" dur="4.411">so what happens is they figured out a</text>
  <text start="208.22" dur="4.59">way to keep everyone quiet first it was</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="4.32">with entitlement programs now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.81" dur="4.41">just going to print up free money for</text>
  <text start="214.94" dur="3.54">everyone and we can see this is part of</text>
  <text start="217.22" dur="4.14">their plan because the system is not</text>
  <text start="218.48" dur="5.85">really developed to create economic</text>
  <text start="221.36" dur="6.33">growth now we understand that the youth</text>
  <text start="224.33" dur="5.97">here in America well they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="227.69" dur="3.84">very difficult time first of all they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="230.3" dur="4.29">gone to college they have these huge</text>
  <text start="231.53" dur="4.47">student loans they can&amp;#39;t find work maybe</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="3.179">they find part-time work and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236" dur="4.53">living with their parents there is a new</text>
  <text start="237.769" dur="4.741">study out there from apartment lists and</text>
  <text start="240.53" dur="5.31">it confirmed the underlying problem</text>
  <text start="242.51" dur="6.57">nearly 70% of young American adults</text>
  <text start="245.84" dur="6.6">those aged 18 to 34 said they have saved</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="6.9">less than $1,000 for a down payment for</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="6.479">a home and this is similar to another</text>
  <text start="255.98" dur="5.099">survey which is go banking which they</text>
  <text start="258.919" dur="4.981">looked at this last year and they saw</text>
  <text start="261.079" dur="5.941">the same exact thing where 72% of the</text>
  <text start="263.9" dur="5.28">young Millennials those between 1824 had</text>
  <text start="267.02" dur="5.52">a thousand in their savings accounts and</text>
  <text start="269.18" dur="5.82">31% had zero so when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="272.54" dur="5.01">can see these individuals this is the</text>
  <text start="275" dur="4.26">next generation if this generation is</text>
  <text start="277.55" dur="5.46">not working if this generation is not</text>
  <text start="279.26" dur="5.49">saving if this generation is not doing</text>
  <text start="283.01" dur="4.409">what the previous generations have been</text>
  <text start="284.75" dur="5.43">doing we have a major problem and the</text>
  <text start="287.419" dur="6.771">reason for this is because again the</text>
  <text start="290.18" dur="7.17">system the central banking system is not</text>
  <text start="294.19" dur="5.74">developed to help the everyday person</text>
  <text start="297.35" dur="5.28">and if you look over time and usually</text>
  <text start="299.93" dur="6.03">these Biot system lasts between 40 to 50</text>
  <text start="302.63" dur="6.15">years they break down over time and in</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="5.13">the beginning of the period you see high</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="4.65">interest rates you see wages going up</text>
  <text start="311.09" dur="6.69">you see inflation at the end of the</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="5.67">cycle what you see is lower wages lower</text>
  <text start="317.78" dur="3.5">income</text>
  <text start="319.1" dur="3.48">interest rates have to be dropped and</text>
  <text start="321.28" dur="4.39">jobs</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="6.48">completely disappear and everything is</text>
  <text start="325.67" dur="5.73">built on an illusion statistics have to</text>
  <text start="329.06" dur="4.47">be manipulated and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="331.4" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now nearly 40% of</text>
  <text start="333.53" dur="5.79">older millennials those ages 25 to 34 by</text>
  <text start="336.92" dur="4.77">historical measures should already own</text>
  <text start="339.32" dur="5.58">or be a few years away from home</text>
  <text start="341.69" dur="5.16">ownership and right now they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="344.9" dur="3.9">close the vast majority some 80 percent</text>
  <text start="346.85" dur="5.06">of Millennials said they eventually plan</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="6.6">to buy a home but they don&amp;#39;t make enough</text>
  <text start="351.91" dur="5.41">to save for the house they have all</text>
  <text start="355.4" dur="4.32">these payments auto insurance car</text>
  <text start="357.32" dur="3.72">payments rent payment if they&amp;#39;re living</text>
  <text start="359.72" dur="3.33">with their parents they&amp;#39;re still paying</text>
  <text start="361.04" dur="3.42">student loans if they are renting</text>
  <text start="363.05" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re still paying their student loans</text>
  <text start="364.46" dur="4.2">the salaries haven&amp;#39;t increased many of</text>
  <text start="366.95" dur="3.42">these individuals can&amp;#39;t even find that</text>
  <text start="368.66" dur="3.84">full-time job in and working one two</text>
  <text start="370.37" dur="5.28">part-time jobs so you can see the entire</text>
  <text start="372.5" dur="5.63">system is breaking down now in one place</text>
  <text start="375.65" dur="4.71">that we can see this is Connecticut</text>
  <text start="378.13" dur="5.53">Connecticut&amp;#39;s general obligation bonds</text>
  <text start="380.36" dur="4.02">well they are riskier than ever because</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="4.97">why</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="7.65">plummeting income tax collections and a</text>
  <text start="388.63" dur="5.2">2.3 billion budget deficit which</text>
  <text start="392.03" dur="5.82">actually moved all three credit rating</text>
  <text start="393.83" dur="5.76">companies to downgrade its debt now tax</text>
  <text start="397.85" dur="5.58">receipts for the current fiscal year</text>
  <text start="399.59" dur="6.6">ending in June will be about 451 million</text>
  <text start="403.43" dur="8.13">short of their estimates from January</text>
  <text start="406.19" dur="7.47">and basically Governor Dannel Malloy he</text>
  <text start="411.56" dur="5.52">is going and he&amp;#39;s going to empty the</text>
  <text start="413.66" dur="8.58">state&amp;#39;s small budget Stabilization Fund</text>
  <text start="417.08" dur="7.44">to keep the state operational so what</text>
  <text start="422.24" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that there are</text>
  <text start="424.52" dur="4.77">less and less individuals working and</text>
  <text start="426.86" dur="4.74">this is not just the only state there</text>
  <text start="429.29" dur="3.84">are many other states that are feeling</text>
  <text start="431.6" dur="3.06">the same exact thing because when we</text>
  <text start="433.13" dur="3.9">look around and we did we&amp;#39;ve done this</text>
  <text start="434.66" dur="3.99">in past reports that tax receipts are</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="4.74">continually declining thing about it</text>
  <text start="438.65" dur="4.95">when you lay off individuals from</text>
  <text start="441.77" dur="4.29">corporations and corporations lay off</text>
  <text start="443.6" dur="3.87">thousands of people retail stores are</text>
  <text start="446.06" dur="2.46">closing and it&amp;#39;s not just the part-time</text>
  <text start="447.47" dur="3.06">people that are losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="448.52" dur="4.27">it&amp;#39;s the full-time people that were</text>
  <text start="450.53" dur="4.66">getting the higher salaries</text>
  <text start="452.79" dur="4.26">those tax receipts they aren&amp;#39;t coming</text>
  <text start="455.19" dur="3.84">into the government anymore and as</text>
  <text start="457.05" dur="3.69">people lose these high-paying full-time</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="4.77">jobs and they&amp;#39;re getting part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="460.74" dur="5.43">that that that tax receipts decrease and</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="6.03">this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing over time</text>
  <text start="466.17" dur="5.94">now we see there&amp;#39;s two GDP estimates</text>
  <text start="469.83" dur="5.79">that are coming out now it&amp;#39;s the GDP now</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="6.06">from the Atlanta Fed and we have the New</text>
  <text start="475.62" dur="4.59">York Fed which is now cast and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.17" dur="4.59">heading in opposite directions right now</text>
  <text start="480.21" dur="4.11">the Atlanta Fed well their latest</text>
  <text start="482.76" dur="3.51">forecast is three point seven percent</text>
  <text start="484.32" dur="3.6">they started at four percent</text>
  <text start="486.27" dur="4.89">they are down now to three point seven</text>
  <text start="487.92" dur="6.12">percent and when we look at the New York</text>
  <text start="491.16" dur="5.01">Fed forecast they&amp;#39;re at two point two</text>
  <text start="494.04" dur="4.58">percent so they&amp;#39;re going in opposite</text>
  <text start="496.17" dur="5.1">directions and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="498.62" dur="4.75">even though they start out at these high</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="4.59">numbers they all end at the lower number</text>
  <text start="503.37" dur="4.86">then it&amp;#39;s revised and most of the time</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="4.95">what they&amp;#39;ll end up doing is they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="508.23" dur="4.439">throw in exports of soybeans</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;ll play with the inventory numbers</text>
  <text start="512.669" dur="5.461">they used to use Obamacare because a lot</text>
  <text start="515.76" dur="3.42">of people were on Obamacare and people</text>
  <text start="518.13" dur="3.36">who are dropping off because it was just</text>
  <text start="519.18" dur="5.36">getting too expensive and the expenses</text>
  <text start="521.49" dur="7.41">that they&amp;#39;ve paid for these insurance</text>
  <text start="524.54" dur="7.54">plans this is what they used as the</text>
  <text start="528.9" dur="6.09">population spending into the economy and</text>
  <text start="532.08" dur="5.28">they included this in retail which is</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="3.9">ridiculous because you&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="537.36" dur="3.59">absolutely nothing if you don&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="538.89" dur="4.8">anything you&amp;#39;re just throwing out money</text>
  <text start="540.95" dur="4.63">even if you go to the doctor you still</text>
  <text start="543.69" dur="3.63">have to meet a deductible and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.58" dur="3.39">never getting any of the returns but</text>
  <text start="547.32" dur="3.54">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="548.97" dur="3.57">total breakdown of the system and these</text>
  <text start="550.86" dur="3.93">GDP numbers are gonna go much much lower</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="4.2">yes they will manipulate them yes</text>
  <text start="554.79" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;ll throw in something in there just</text>
  <text start="556.74" dur="4.85">to boost them back up but when we look</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="5.64">at everything right now we can see that</text>
  <text start="561.59" dur="4.42">the hard reality is the economy is</text>
  <text start="564.99" dur="3.78">breaking down</text>
  <text start="566.01" dur="5.28">it is a t rating at at an accelerated</text>

  <text start="634.35" dur="5.43">remember how they calculate retail sales</text>
  <text start="637.14" dur="5.34">now we&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of stores closed</text>
  <text start="639.78" dur="4.11">just in the first half of this year 3500</text>
  <text start="642.48" dur="4.47">are projecting about eighty six hundred</text>

  <text start="662.07" dur="5.07">average out the sales over the entire</text>
  <text start="664.47" dur="4.62">year to make it look a lot better this</text>
  <text start="667.14" dur="3.15">is how they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating all</text>
  <text start="669.09" dur="2.76">these numbers it&amp;#39;s almost like the</text>
  <text start="670.29" dur="2.94">unemployment numbers where those people</text>
  <text start="671.85" dur="3.33">fallen off or haven&amp;#39;t been on an</text>
  <text start="673.23" dur="3.69">interview for four weeks well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.18" dur="3.9">just not counted they don&amp;#39;t want a job</text>
  <text start="676.92" dur="3.72">they stop looking for the job even</text>

  <text start="680.64" dur="4.53">want a job they&amp;#39;re just not counted</text>
  <text start="682.71" dur="3.93">anymore so all these statistics we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="685.17" dur="3.69">learned that they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="686.64" dur="3.75">manipulated and this is done on purpose</text>
  <text start="688.86" dur="3.75">because the system is completely</text>
  <text start="690.39" dur="5.04">breaking down and as the system breaks</text>
  <text start="692.61" dur="5.04">down what do you need to do well you</text>
  <text start="695.43" dur="4.23">need to manipulate all statistical</text>
  <text start="697.65" dur="4.14">numbers what else do you need to do well</text>
  <text start="699.66" dur="3.54">you need to pump up the stock market to</text>
  <text start="701.79" dur="3.93">make it look like the economy&amp;#39;s doing a</text>
  <text start="703.2" dur="4.92">lot better than it really is you have to</text>
  <text start="705.72" dur="4.14">increase the entitlement programs more</text>
  <text start="708.12" dur="4.65">and more individuals will go on these</text>
  <text start="709.86" dur="5.25">programs why because they can&amp;#39;t get by</text>
  <text start="712.77" dur="7.05">without them because there are no jobs</text>
  <text start="715.11" dur="4.979">out there once this fails and there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="719.82" dur="2.22">many</text>
  <text start="720.089" dur="4.29">people on entitlement and they realize</text>
  <text start="722.04" dur="4.229">that more and more jobs well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="724.379" dur="3.96">being lost and people can&amp;#39;t find them</text>
  <text start="726.269" dur="5.82">well to keep everyone quiet what do they</text>
  <text start="728.339" dur="6.151">do they bring up universal basic income</text>
  <text start="732.089" dur="3.151">which is really here&amp;#39;s some money from</text>
  <text start="734.49" dur="3.889">the government</text>
  <text start="735.24" dur="6.029">stay quiet living living your house and</text>
  <text start="738.379" dur="4.93">this is how it&amp;#39;s going to be for now on</text>
  <text start="741.269" dur="4.62">which means you&amp;#39;ll just be getting by</text>
  <text start="743.309" dur="4.351">day by day maybe have enough for the</text>
  <text start="745.889" dur="3.63">bills maybe not have enough for the</text>
  <text start="747.66" dur="3.989">bills but everyone will stay quiet</text>
  <text start="749.519" dur="5.25">because they want to receive that income</text>
  <text start="751.649" dur="6.54">once that fails the entire system</text>
  <text start="754.769" dur="7.17">implodes there&amp;#39;s nothing else to do now</text>
  <text start="758.189" dur="6.63">during this period the central bank has</text>
  <text start="761.939" dur="4.981">been creating so much currency and this</text>
  <text start="764.819" dur="4.68">currency guess what it&amp;#39;s now in the</text>
  <text start="766.92" dur="4.529">public once it&amp;#39;s in the public well you</text>
  <text start="769.499" dur="4.26">have something else happening because</text>
  <text start="771.449" dur="5.781">now there&amp;#39;s more dollars in circulation</text>
  <text start="773.759" dur="6.12">which means the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="777.23" dur="5.109">decreases which means cost of the</text>
  <text start="779.879" dur="5.491">products goes up which means the money</text>
  <text start="782.339" dur="5.34">that you&amp;#39;re receiving decreases in value</text>
  <text start="785.37" dur="5.04">and the situation just gets worse and</text>
  <text start="787.679" dur="4.83">worse and worse and guess what the debt</text>
  <text start="790.41" dur="4.469">keeps going up and guess what else</text>
  <text start="792.509" dur="4.38">happens there&amp;#39;s interest attached on</text>
  <text start="794.879" dur="3.661">that debt there&amp;#39;s lower tax receipts</text>

  <text start="814.23" dur="6.51">to devise it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter now</text>
