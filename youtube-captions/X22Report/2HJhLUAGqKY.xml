  <text start="77.36" dur="5.13">have been shut down for three weeks and</text>
  <text start="80.06" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;ve been under capital controls and</text>
  <text start="82.49" dur="3.989">what we&amp;#39;re noticing is the economy in</text>
  <text start="85.25" dur="4.53">Greece because the banks have been shut</text>
  <text start="86.479" dur="7.971">down has been hurting basically retail</text>
  <text start="89.78" dur="6.81">trade has lost about 600 million euros</text>
  <text start="94.45" dur="4.42">according to the Athens Chamber of</text>
  <text start="96.59" dur="4.08">Commerce and Industry some 4,500</text>
  <text start="98.87" dur="3.27">containers with raw materials and</text>
  <text start="100.67" dur="4.17">finished products are currently blocked</text>
  <text start="102.14" dur="5.73">at customs since importers cannot carry</text>
  <text start="104.84" dur="5.61">out any banking transactions and there</text>
  <text start="107.87" dur="4.62">is a backlog of checks and bills of</text>
  <text start="110.45" dur="3.36">exchange that cannot be paid meaning</text>
  <text start="112.49" dur="4.14">that business transactions worth</text>
  <text start="113.81" dur="5.669">estimated about now six six billion</text>
  <text start="116.63" dur="5.97">euros have been frozen right now so</text>
  <text start="119.479" dur="6.541">Greece is in a tough spot right now and</text>
  <text start="122.6" dur="6.389">right now the Greek government they have</text>
  <text start="126.02" dur="6.299">issued a decree ordering the banks to</text>
  <text start="128.989" dur="6.78">reopen on Monday but even if these banks</text>
  <text start="132.319" dur="5.551">do reopen that capital controls will</text>
  <text start="135.769" dur="4.411">still be in effect and this is what we</text>
  <text start="137.87" dur="4.289">are seeing people will still only be</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="5.1">able to take out about 60 euros a day</text>
  <text start="142.159" dur="5.791">and for the whole entire week the</text>
  <text start="145.28" dur="4.59">cumulative weekly withdrawal limit is at</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="3.36">about a four hundred and twenty euros</text>
  <text start="149.87" dur="5.13">which is about four hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="151.31" dur="5.58">eight dollars and you will not be able</text>
  <text start="155" dur="4.29">to transfer money anywhere else in</text>
  <text start="156.89" dur="4.59">Greece they&amp;#39;re saying that those people</text>
  <text start="159.29" dur="4.98">who are studying abroad they can</text>
  <text start="161.48" dur="6.66">electronic transfer up to 5,000 euros</text>
  <text start="164.27" dur="5.79">/ trimester people receiving health</text>
  <text start="168.14" dur="6.42">treatment abroad will be able to access</text>
  <text start="170.06" dur="6.48">about 2,000 euros in cash a broad range</text>
  <text start="174.56" dur="4.89">of capital controls still remain in</text>
  <text start="176.54" dur="6.81">place however including a block on</text>
  <text start="179.45" dur="5.37">capital transfers the decree also</text>
  <text start="183.35" dur="3.15">enables the Bank of Greece to restrict</text>
  <text start="184.82" dur="5.79">the amount of euros or other currency</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="6.39">carried in cash out of Greece and of</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="4.68">course but with this new deal they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="192.89" dur="5.37">going to implement new sales tax rates</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="5.91">and people are going to be taxed even</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="6.03">more even know people are hurting they</text>
  <text start="201.2" dur="6.96">still want more money and we can see</text>
  <text start="204.29" dur="7.74">just from Greece from Cyprus these</text>
  <text start="208.16" dur="7.65">capital controls will probably implement</text>
  <text start="212.03" dur="5.97">it for a long period of time and that</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="4.83">money that is stuck in the banks is</text>
  <text start="218" dur="5.7">going to be held in the banks people</text>
  <text start="220.64" dur="5.75">have a very hard time getting that money</text>
  <text start="223.7" dur="5.55">out yes you can go every single day and</text>
  <text start="226.39" dur="5.5">hit your maximum weekly withdrawal but</text>
  <text start="229.25" dur="4.65">it will take you a very long time to get</text>
  <text start="231.89" dur="3.69">your money out of the system a lot of</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="3.9">people already took a lot of their money</text>
  <text start="235.58" dur="5.58">out of the system and they are probably</text>
  <text start="237.8" dur="6.6">glad they did but we see this debt</text>
  <text start="241.16" dur="5.34">situation it cannot be sustained and</text>
  <text start="244.4" dur="5.22">coming out of the economic collapse blog</text>
  <text start="246.5" dur="7.459">we see that there are 24 nations that</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="7.86">are facing the same exact debt crisis</text>
  <text start="253.959" dur="5.861">where they will not be able to sustain</text>
  <text start="257.48" dur="4.68">this and sooner or later they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="259.82" dur="5.19">to have a problem I mean look at Spain</text>
  <text start="262.16" dur="5.43">right now their debt to GDP has riven</text>
  <text start="265.01" dur="7.62">has risen from 69 to ninety-eight</text>
  <text start="267.59" dur="9.93">percent Italy one from 116 to 132 France</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="7.17">from 85 to 95 percent and that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="277.52" dur="5.73">only countries there&amp;#39;s many more Belgium</text>
  <text start="279.8" dur="6.9">is it a hundred and six percent debt to</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="6.39">GDP island 109 debt to GDP portugal a</text>
  <text start="286.7" dur="6.66">hundred and thirty debt to GDP we are</text>
  <text start="289.64" dur="7.8">looking at the same exact scenarios here</text>
  <text start="293.36" dur="4.889">and as time goes on and there are people</text>
  <text start="297.44" dur="3.259">that</text>
  <text start="298.249" dur="5.22">those people that can&amp;#39;t find jobs and</text>
  <text start="300.699" dur="4.03">more people are laid off and as the</text>
  <text start="303.469" dur="2.28">country&amp;#39;s take on more debt the</text>
  <text start="304.729" dur="3.45">situation&amp;#39;s not going to get better</text>
  <text start="305.749" dur="6.66">remember president Hollande and France</text>
  <text start="308.179" dur="9.15">told us back in 2013 his country is in</text>
  <text start="312.409" dur="7.19">recovery right now in 2014 he said the</text>
  <text start="317.329" dur="6.54">country is going to see incredible</text>
  <text start="319.599" dur="7.9">recovery what have they seen nothing it</text>
  <text start="323.869" dur="6.42">has gotten worse since that time it</text>
  <text start="327.499" dur="4.59">hasn&amp;#39;t gotten better just like they told</text>
  <text start="330.289" dur="8.37">us in Greece they told us it was going</text>
  <text start="332.089" dur="9">to get better in 2008 2010 2012 2014 and</text>
  <text start="338.659" dur="5.31">look where we are today nothing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.089" dur="6.24">changed actually they&amp;#39;ve received more</text>
  <text start="343.969" dur="6.69">debt and more austerity that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="347.329" dur="7.14">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s changed we see China right</text>
  <text start="350.659" dur="7.38">now they are dumping their Treasuries</text>
  <text start="354.469" dur="6.45">China has now sold a record of 96</text>
  <text start="358.039" dur="5.58">billion in Treasuries in the last three</text>
  <text start="360.919" dur="4.98">months and they use Belgium to sell them</text>
  <text start="363.619" dur="3.84">they don&amp;#39;t sell them outright and this</text>
  <text start="365.899" dur="3.27">is why the corporate media is not</text>
  <text start="367.459" dur="5.43">picking up on what they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="369.169" dur="5.78">doing China has already dumped a record</text>
  <text start="372.889" dur="5.85">a hundred and seven billion in u.s.</text>
  <text start="374.949" dur="7.3">treasuries in 2015 and they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="378.739" dur="5.58">quietly they don&amp;#39;t want to take they</text>
  <text start="382.249" dur="5.94">don&amp;#39;t want too much attention on this</text>
  <text start="384.319" dur="6.51">and they&amp;#39;re doing this to keep the you</text>
  <text start="388.189" dur="5.46">wan remember stable the dumping the</text>
  <text start="390.829" dur="4.38">Treasuries at this time and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="393.649" dur="3.78">going to be dumping a lot more and i</text>
  <text start="395.209" dur="4.74">have this graph on the x 22 report com</text>
  <text start="397.429" dur="7.19">site you can see that they have been</text>
  <text start="399.949" dur="6.6">dropping and dumping their Treasuries</text>
  <text start="404.619" dur="4.991">because they&amp;#39;re looking at the situation</text>
  <text start="406.549" dur="5.61">and they realize okay we need to</text>
  <text start="409.61" dur="5.099">separate ourselves from the u.s. we need</text>
  <text start="412.159" dur="4.38">to get rid of these Treasuries we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="414.709" dur="3.45">want to be holding them when the system</text>
  <text start="416.539" dur="4.29">comes down because they know the United</text>
  <text start="418.159" dur="5.13">States is not going to make good on this</text>
  <text start="420.829" dur="4.29">and you can see they&amp;#39;re dumping them and</text>
  <text start="423.289" dur="4.8">actually they&amp;#39;re purchasing gold they</text>
  <text start="425.119" dur="5.981">have purchased a huge amount of gold and</text>
  <text start="428.089" dur="6.161">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="5.61">now we&amp;#39;ve talked about Japan how they</text>
  <text start="434.25" dur="4.2">want to change article 9 which makes</text>
  <text start="436.71" dur="3.84">them a pacifist nation and they can go</text>
  <text start="438.45" dur="5.58">out and they can join the fight with the</text>
  <text start="440.55" dur="7.47">u.s. well it looks like it finally</text>
  <text start="444.03" dur="7.25">happened even though the people of Japan</text>
  <text start="448.02" dur="5.82">said no we do not want this to happen</text>
  <text start="451.28" dur="4.84">they did it anyway and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="453.84" dur="5.19">talking about this for quite a while and</text>
  <text start="456.12" dur="5.04">that whole entire stretch of time they</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="4.4">finally did it that we haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="5.22">anything like this since World War two</text>
  <text start="463.43" dur="6.28">defying the broad public opposition and</text>
  <text start="466.38" dur="6.12">large demonstration Prime Minister Abe a</text>
  <text start="469.71" dur="5.67">he won a crucial vote in parliament on</text>
  <text start="472.5" dur="5.46">Thursday which would give Japan&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.38" dur="7.2">military limited powers to fight in</text>
  <text start="477.96" dur="7.86">foreign conflicts we can see at this</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="6.69">point in time everything is being</text>
  <text start="485.82" dur="6.45">prepared it&amp;#39;s getting ready for the next</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="5.82">war and you know even though the people</text>

  <text start="495.09" dur="4.05">moving their base from one area to</text>
  <text start="496.86" dur="5.73">another area in Japan they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="499.14" dur="5.58">do it anyhow it makes no difference what</text>
  <text start="502.59" dur="6.21">the people want or think we saw that in</text>
  <text start="504.72" dur="8.759">Greece we see out in Ukraine situation</text>
  <text start="508.8" dur="8.06">is escalating we see that the US has</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="5.761">delivered a hundred Humvees to Ukraine</text>
  <text start="516.86" dur="4.84">they received the first batch of ten</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="6.87">Humvees back in March now an additional</text>
  <text start="521.7" dur="6.72">100 has been delivered we see Donetsk</text>
  <text start="526.11" dur="3.48">and Lugansk they said okay under the</text>
  <text start="528.42" dur="3.81">Minsk agreement we&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="529.59" dur="3.99">withdrawing our weapons away from the</text>
  <text start="532.23" dur="4.38">contact line these are the smaller</text>
  <text start="533.58" dur="5.4">weapons a hundred millimeter caliber and</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;re showing as good faith we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.98" dur="4.14">following the Minsk agreement we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="550.05" dur="4.94">they&amp;#39;re keeping their weapons right</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="4.8">there they&amp;#39;re not moving it whatsoever</text>
  <text start="554.99" dur="4.72">so we can see what&amp;#39;s happening at this</text>
  <text start="557.34" dur="4.56">point actually what the reporting is</text>
  <text start="559.71" dur="4.59">that there&amp;#39;s more and more troops more</text>

  <text start="705.029" dur="3.031">this point and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="706.44" dur="3.75">follow this very very closely because it</text>
  <text start="708.06" dur="6.45">looks like things are really starting to</text>
  <text start="710.19" dur="6.72">build up now if we look at what happened</text>
  <text start="714.51" dur="5.639">in Chattanooga we are starting to see</text>
  <text start="716.91" dur="4.489">all different stories come out and one</text>
  <text start="720.149" dur="3.421">of them is very interesting because</text>
  <text start="721.399" dur="4.421">they&amp;#39;re saying that he was battling</text>
  <text start="723.57" dur="4.53">depression and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="725.82" dur="6.57">that he if he was on some type of</text>
  <text start="728.1" dur="7.26">medication like sssr I SSRIs because</text>

  <text start="735.36" dur="5.43">nothing new these people are heavily</text>
  <text start="738.3" dur="5.99">medicated the FBI gets in touch with</text>
  <text start="740.79" dur="5.989">them they put ideas into their head and</text>
  <text start="744.29" dur="5.83">then all of a sudden we have a shooting</text>
  <text start="746.779" dur="5.881">now they can&amp;#39;t make the link to the</text>
  <text start="750.12" dur="4.98">Islamic state so we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="752.66" dur="4.6">additional information out there saying</text>
  <text start="755.1" dur="7.37">that this is a new generation of</text>
  <text start="757.26" dur="7.59">terrorists a new generation I mean the</text>
  <text start="762.47" dur="4.57">different agendas that are going on</text>

  <text start="767.04" dur="5.43">have those people who are trying to</text>
  <text start="769.17" dur="5.28">scare us into war scare us that the</text>
  <text start="772.47" dur="4.59">Islamic state is coming for us and I</text>
  <text start="774.45" dur="5.19">heard on a report from Fox News that the</text>
  <text start="777.06" dur="5.089">Islamic state statement was put out</text>
  <text start="779.64" dur="5.21">there that they&amp;#39;re going to be attacking</text>
  <text start="782.149" dur="5.801">different states just like you saw in</text>
  <text start="784.85" dur="5.35">Tennessee and we knew this build-up was</text>
  <text start="787.95" dur="4.29">going to come I mean think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="790.2" dur="3.66">happening at this point we have the</text>
  <text start="792.24" dur="3.36">authorization for war pending in</text>
  <text start="793.86" dur="3.12">Congress now that allows the United</text>
  <text start="795.6" dur="4.2">States government central bankers to go</text>
  <text start="796.98" dur="4.859">after the Islamic state al Qaeda boko</text>
  <text start="799.8" dur="4.77">haram al-shabaab or any other terrorist</text>
  <text start="801.839" dur="4.171">organization anywhere in the world</text>
  <text start="804.57" dur="5.759">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what country they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="806.01" dur="8.16">it has no traction in Congress and they</text>
  <text start="810.329" dur="6.961">know they need to get into Syria and</text>
  <text start="814.17" dur="4.979">remove Assad they know they need to get</text>
  <text start="817.29" dur="6.539">back into those countries like Libya</text>
  <text start="819.149" dur="7.291">Lebanon Yemen Iraq and remove those</text>
  <text start="823.829" dur="4.891">people who are causing a problem fight</text>
  <text start="826.44" dur="6.12">them back and keep the puppet government</text>
  <text start="828.72" dur="7.29">in power and now we have Jay</text>
  <text start="832.56" dur="6.51">helm which is going on right now</text>
  <text start="836.01" dur="5.28">currently all the way to September some</text>
  <text start="839.07" dur="5.55">people say as it has been extended into</text>
  <text start="841.29" dur="5.64">the November and now we have the Islamic</text>
  <text start="844.62" dur="5.09">state attacking all different regions of</text>
  <text start="846.93" dur="6.81">the United States to put the fear of the</text>
  <text start="849.71" dur="6.37">Islamic state into the people to push</text>
  <text start="853.74" dur="4.74">Congress to pass the authorization for</text>
  <text start="856.08" dur="7.17">war and we&amp;#39;ve been telling you and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="858.48" dur="7.29">been talking about this that there is</text>
  <text start="863.25" dur="6.47">going to be some type of an event if</text>
  <text start="865.77" dur="8.64">they can&amp;#39;t get this legislation passed</text>
  <text start="869.72" dur="7.51">they will use events to push it along</text>
  <text start="874.41" dur="4.619">we&amp;#39;ve seen this many many times and</text>
  <text start="877.23" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this very</text>
  <text start="879.029" dur="5.551">carefully because as we know all the</text>
  <text start="881.94" dur="4.11">operatives are standing by they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="884.58" dur="4.32">waiting for the green light for the</text>
  <text start="886.05" dur="6.63">go-ahead and that this one little</text>
  <text start="888.9" dur="5.16">shooting this cannot be the event it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="892.68" dur="2.64">going to have to be something much much</text>
  <text start="894.06" dur="3.84">larger and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="895.32" dur="5.01">this now what&amp;#39;s very interesting General</text>
  <text start="897.9" dur="4.71">Wesley Clark came out and he said</text>
  <text start="900.33" dur="5.43">something very interesting that we</text>
  <text start="902.61" dur="6.26">should be starting internment camps for</text>
  <text start="905.76" dur="6.78">those US citizens that are radicalized</text>
  <text start="908.87" dur="5.26">so we&amp;#39;re seeing what Nazi Germany did</text>
  <text start="912.54" dur="4.71">and what the United States did to the</text>
  <text start="914.13" dur="6">Japanese this is what he said we have</text>
  <text start="917.25" dur="5.67">we&amp;#39;ve got to identify the people who are</text>
  <text start="920.13" dur="5.79">most likely to be radicalized we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="922.92" dur="4.62">to cut this off at the beginning there</text>
  <text start="925.92" dur="4.02">are always a certain number of young</text>
  <text start="927.54" dur="4.35">people who are alienated they don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="929.94" dur="4.86">a job they lost a girlfriend their</text>
  <text start="931.89" dur="5.819">family doesn&amp;#39;t feel happy and we can</text>
  <text start="934.8" dur="5.22">watch these signs we can watch these</text>
  <text start="937.709" dur="4.441">people and there are members of the</text>
  <text start="940.02" dur="3.81">community who can reach out to those</text>
  <text start="942.15" dur="3.63">people and bring them back in and</text>
  <text start="943.83" dur="4.05">encourage them to look at their</text>
  <text start="945.78" dur="4.29">blessings here but I don&amp;#39;t think on a</text>
  <text start="947.88" dur="4.38">national possible level we need to look</text>
  <text start="950.07" dur="4.95">at what self-radicalization means</text>
  <text start="952.26" dur="5.579">because we are at war with this group of</text>
  <text start="955.02" dur="5.4">terrorists they do have an ideology in</text>
  <text start="957.839" dur="3.991">World War two if someone supported Nazi</text>
  <text start="960.42" dur="4.47">Germany at the expense of the United</text>
  <text start="961.83" dur="4.53">States we didn&amp;#39;t say that this was</text>
  <text start="964.89" dur="5.34">freedom of speech we put</text>
  <text start="966.36" dur="6.06">camp they were prisoners of war so if</text>
  <text start="970.23" dur="4.38">these people are radicalized and they</text>
  <text start="972.42" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t support the United States they are</text>
  <text start="974.61" dur="8.909">disloyal to the United States as a</text>
  <text start="977.82" dur="8.759">matter of principle it&amp;#39;s our right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="983.519" dur="5.851">our right and obligation to segregate</text>
  <text start="986.579" dur="5.431">them from normal community and put them</text>
  <text start="989.37" dur="6.06">in these camps now I have a problem with</text>
  <text start="992.01" dur="8.67">this because these people haven&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="995.43" dur="7.77">anything wrong these people and this</text>
  <text start="1000.68" dur="4.26">could be me or you because look at what</text>
  <text start="1003.2" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re looking at here they have no</text>
  <text start="1004.94" dur="5.19">evidence of anything they&amp;#39;re just saying</text>
  <text start="1007.31" dur="7.019">yes these people meet a certain criteria</text>
  <text start="1010.13" dur="7.199">let&amp;#39;s throw them in a camp and this is</text>
  <text start="1014.329" dur="4.44">how it begins and this is something we</text>
  <text start="1017.329" dur="4.231">should all be nervous about and when he</text>
  <text start="1018.769" dur="4.26">says if you&amp;#39;re against the United States</text>
  <text start="1021.56" dur="3.33">well what does that really mean against</text>
  <text start="1023.029" dur="5.341">you what you don&amp;#39;t agree with the United</text>
  <text start="1024.89" dur="7.679">States well let me ask you those</text>
  <text start="1028.37" dur="7.469">founding fathers who fought in the</text>
  <text start="1032.569" dur="5.85">revolution didn&amp;#39;t agree with the British</text>
  <text start="1035.839" dur="5.73">government they disagreed with the</text>
  <text start="1038.419" dur="6.03">British government should they have been</text>
  <text start="1041.569" dur="5.451">thrown in internment camp well if they</text>
  <text start="1044.449" dur="6.961">were we wouldn&amp;#39;t have what we have today</text>
  <text start="1047.02" dur="8.5">so those people who disagree with the</text>
  <text start="1051.41" dur="5.61">United States government I guess what</text>
  <text start="1055.52" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re saying is they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1057.02" dur="4.89">thrown into an internment camp this is</text>
  <text start="1059.39" dur="4.83">what they want to do now are they going</text>
  <text start="1061.91" dur="4.1">to do it tomorrow most likely not but</text>
  <text start="1064.22" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re trying to get a feel of how</text>
  <text start="1066.01" dur="6.13">people think about it they&amp;#39;re putting it</text>
  <text start="1069.86" dur="4.319">out there to make you think like yeah</text>
  <text start="1072.14" dur="4.38">this is a good idea I mean we saw what</text>
  <text start="1074.179" dur="3.691">happened in Nazi Germany we saw what</text>
  <text start="1076.52" dur="4.05">happened here in the United States they</text>
  <text start="1077.87" dur="5.189">just threw people who of Japanese</text>
  <text start="1080.57" dur="5.359">descent they throw them in camps well</text>
  <text start="1083.059" dur="4.981">I&amp;#39;m sorry if you&amp;#39;ve done nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="1085.929" dur="5.531">united states government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1088.04" dur="6.42">have no right to throw you into a camp</text>
  <text start="1091.46" dur="4.29">whatsoever and if you disagree with the</text>
  <text start="1094.46" dur="3.78">government or don&amp;#39;t agree with the</text>
  <text start="1095.75" dur="4.02">policies of the government they still</text>
  <text start="1098.24" dur="4.14">have no right to do this</text>
  <text start="1099.77" dur="5.52">but again they want certain people shut</text>
  <text start="1102.38" dur="8.49">up and again is this really going to</text>
  <text start="1105.29" dur="8.31">make everyone safe no this is a tool to</text>
