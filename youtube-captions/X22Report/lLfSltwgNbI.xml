  <text start="65.15" dur="6.78">episode is US government issues warning</text>
  <text start="68.06" dur="6.15">against North Korea&amp;#39;s hidden Cobra let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.93" dur="5.43">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="74.21" dur="5.43">and geopolitical news now the Cabal as</text>
  <text start="77.36" dur="4.86">we know they are running out of time and</text>
  <text start="79.64" dur="4.83">we also understand that certain</text>
  <text start="82.22" dur="4.89">individuals in government they realize</text>
  <text start="84.47" dur="5.13">that things are closing in on them and</text>
  <text start="87.11" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda as hard as</text>
  <text start="89.6" dur="4.08">they possibly can and we see that there</text>
  <text start="91.58" dur="5.07">are five Democrats that have filed the</text>
  <text start="93.68" dur="4.59">articles of impeachment against Trump we</text>
  <text start="96.65" dur="5.359">see democratic representative Steve</text>
  <text start="98.27" dur="4.89">Cohen Lewis Gwydir era&amp;#39;s Al Green</text>
  <text start="102.009" dur="5.621">Adriana</text>
  <text start="103.16" dur="8.36">s Playa Marcia fudge and John Yarmuth</text>
  <text start="107.63" dur="7.47">and it looks like they filed the</text>
  <text start="111.52" dur="5.92">articles of impeachment and what it says</text>
  <text start="115.1" dur="4.47">is we believe that President Trump has</text>
  <text start="117.44" dur="4.23">violated the Constitution and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="119.57" dur="6.33">introduced five articles of impeachment</text>
  <text start="121.67" dur="6.36">the article targets Trump&amp;#39;s firing a</text>
  <text start="125.9" dur="5.82">former FBI director James Comey</text>
  <text start="128.03" dur="5.88">perceived violations of the emoluments</text>
  <text start="131.72" dur="3.6">clause that bars public officials from</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="4.25">accepting gifts from foreign governments</text>
  <text start="135.32" dur="6.27">as well as actions undermining the</text>
  <text start="138.16" dur="4.84">judiciary and freedom of the press so we</text>
  <text start="141.59" dur="5.51">see right now that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="143" dur="6.09">build a case on absolutely nothing and</text>
  <text start="147.1" dur="4.03">remember this is a long drawn-out</text>
  <text start="149.09" dur="4.56">process and it has to get through the</text>
  <text start="151.13" dur="4.56">House the Senate and it has to go all</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="4.589">the way up and it looks like this is not</text>
  <text start="155.69" dur="4.71">really gonna go anywhere but they are</text>
  <text start="158.239" dur="4.861">trying to push their agenda we see that</text>
  <text start="160.4" dur="4.32">Russia right now they approved a foreign</text>
  <text start="163.1" dur="3.54">agent bill because what has happened</text>
  <text start="164.72" dur="5.79">here in the United States the United</text>
  <text start="166.64" dur="6.39">States made our t file as a foreign</text>
  <text start="170.51" dur="4.77">agent and now Russia has created the</text>
  <text start="173.03" dur="4.64">bill to do the same exact thing in their</text>
  <text start="175.28" dur="5.28">country but they haven&amp;#39;t named any</text>
  <text start="177.67" dur="4.6">organizations or countries as of yet it</text>
  <text start="180.56" dur="4.5">looks like they just pushed the bill</text>
  <text start="182.27" dur="4.47">through to have this ready and on</text>
  <text start="185.06" dur="4.47">standby and</text>
  <text start="186.74" dur="6.24">know that RT right now they are filing</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="6.12">suit saying that you know they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="192.98" dur="5.25">United States is violating their freedom</text>
  <text start="195.65" dur="4.89">of speech right to report and freedom of</text>
  <text start="198.23" dur="5.85">press to report the news and speak the</text>
  <text start="200.54" dur="6.32">truth and this is amazing because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="5.43">having a foreign country saying that the</text>
  <text start="206.86" dur="5.17">United States government which has the</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="5">Constitution with the Bill of Rights</text>
  <text start="212.03" dur="6.56">that says you know the First Amendment</text>
  <text start="214.51" dur="7.57">where it says that you have the right to</text>
  <text start="218.59" dur="6.16">free speech you have the right to</text>
  <text start="222.08" dur="5.04">freedom of the press and the United</text>
  <text start="224.75" dur="5.57">States government is trying to stop this</text>
  <text start="227.12" dur="6.15">which is unbelievably amazing where</text>
  <text start="230.32" dur="8.08">another country another organization has</text>
  <text start="233.27" dur="8.31">to fight to to be allowed to do what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.4" dur="6.29">already here in this country we see the</text>
  <text start="241.58" dur="7.11">EU signs an historic deal to integrate</text>
  <text start="244.69" dur="7.24">23 armies and it looks like they got</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="7.38">their wish where they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="251.93" dur="7.53">all these armies be combined into one</text>
  <text start="256.07" dur="4.89">and they wanted an EU army from the</text>
  <text start="259.46" dur="3.21">beginning and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="260.96" dur="3.21">what they got because they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.67" dur="3.39">going to happen down the line here</text>
  <text start="264.17" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s going to be riots countries are</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="3.6">going to want to separate and it looks</text>
  <text start="268.25" dur="4.98">like they&amp;#39;re gonna be using these armies</text>
  <text start="269.66" dur="5.22">just like to create a NATO back in the</text>
  <text start="273.23" dur="3.3">days of the Cold War they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="4.56">same thing in Europe where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.53" dur="5.97">creating this NATO type of army system</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="5.85">where all the countries are going to you</text>
  <text start="282.5" dur="5.16">know allow Armed Forces to be integrated</text>
  <text start="285.29" dur="3.9">into this one system which is going to</text>
  <text start="287.66" dur="4.95">be control by non elected leaders of</text>
  <text start="289.19" dur="5.46">course and here we are once again where</text>
  <text start="292.61" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re trying to control everything</text>
  <text start="294.65" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s going on in Venezuela we see</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="3.66">venom wet Venezuela has signed a 3.2</text>
  <text start="298.91" dur="5.19">billion debt restructuring deal with</text>
  <text start="300.5" dur="6.81">Russia and again Venezuela is trying to</text>
  <text start="304.1" dur="4.83">figure out all different ways to get</text>
  <text start="307.31" dur="3.06">themselves out of the hole with the</text>
  <text start="308.93" dur="2.85">United States with all these sanctions</text>
  <text start="310.37" dur="3.93">and every country has done this in the</text>
  <text start="311.78" dur="5.28">past where they&amp;#39;re able to go around the</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="4.77">sanctions and survive the sanctions for</text>
  <text start="317.06" dur="3.609">many many years Cuba has done this Iran</text>
  <text start="319.07" dur="3.219">has done this Syria has done</text>
  <text start="320.669" dur="4.231">and many other countries have done this</text>
  <text start="322.289" dur="5.25">North Korea and as we can see at this</text>
  <text start="324.9" dur="6.81">point sanctions really don&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="327.539" dur="5.791">anymore it&amp;#39;s losing its power I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="5.429">think they ever worked because look Cuba</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="7.29">was able to survive all these years with</text>
  <text start="337.139" dur="5.46">all these sanctions on it and Venezuela</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="3.949">is going to make deals with China</text>
  <text start="342.599" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;re already using the petro yuan</text>
  <text start="344.569" dur="4.03">they&amp;#39;re gonna make deals with Russia</text>
  <text start="346.59" dur="4.919">they&amp;#39;re gonna make deals with the BRIC</text>
  <text start="348.599" dur="6.66">nations and they&amp;#39;re gonna restart their</text>
  <text start="351.509" dur="6.84">economy outside of the dollar we see in</text>
  <text start="355.259" dur="6.241">Zimbabwe it might have been the CIA and</text>
  <text start="358.349" dur="5.85">the mi6 which tried to bribe the army to</text>
  <text start="361.5" dur="4.409">remove the president of the country and</text>
  <text start="364.199" dur="4.59">we know that soldiers took to the</text>
  <text start="365.909" dur="5.81">streets and we can see this was a an</text>
  <text start="368.789" dur="5.761">attempt to remove this individual now</text>
  <text start="371.719" dur="4.45">let&amp;#39;s see what happens here but it looks</text>
  <text start="374.55" dur="5.519">like this might have been an</text>
  <text start="376.169" dur="6.541">intelligence operation to change</text>
  <text start="380.069" dur="5.4">government in the country but it looks</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="5.34">like everything has calmed down it looks</text>
  <text start="385.469" dur="5.88">like the president of this country is</text>
  <text start="388.05" dur="7.019">still there and we&amp;#39;ll have to see what</text>
  <text start="391.349" dur="5.701">is going to happen later on we see the</text>
  <text start="395.069" dur="3.6">US House of Representative has</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="3.72">overwhelmingly passed a resolution</text>
  <text start="398.669" dur="4.351">clearly stating that the US military</text>
  <text start="400.77" dur="5.329">assistance to Saudi Arabia in its war</text>
  <text start="403.02" dur="9.149">against Yemen is not authorized by</text>
  <text start="406.099" dur="9.551">Congress this war in Yemen is illegal</text>
  <text start="412.169" dur="6.99">and I hate to say it all the other wars</text>
  <text start="415.65" dur="6.06">are completely illegal Congress should</text>
  <text start="419.159" dur="5.88">be voting on what we&amp;#39;re doing in Syria</text>
  <text start="421.71" dur="6.449">why are we in Iraq why are we in Libya</text>
  <text start="425.039" dur="6.63">why are we on in Lebanon Sudan Somalia</text>
  <text start="428.159" dur="4.891">Ukraine you name it the United States</text>
  <text start="431.669" dur="5.881">should not be involved in any of these</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="7.14">countries and we should be removing our</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="6.419">soldiers from these areas let these</text>
  <text start="440.19" dur="5.64">countries manage themselves and I know</text>
  <text start="443.969" dur="4.801">the only reason why we&amp;#39;re there is to</text>
  <text start="445.83" dur="4.8">basically control the entire Middle East</text>
  <text start="448.77" dur="3.689">because of the petro dollar and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="450.63" dur="3.39">been doing this for many many years</text>
  <text start="452.459" dur="1.921">but we can see right now the petro</text>
  <text start="454.02" dur="3.48">dollar</text>
  <text start="454.38" dur="6.12">is dying the power the power of the</text>
  <text start="457.5" dur="5.28">United States it is falling apart right</text>
  <text start="460.5" dur="4.47">now the economy the global economy is</text>
  <text start="462.78" dur="5.07">falling apart everything that was done</text>
  <text start="464.97" dur="6.84">in the past this whole deal since 1971</text>
  <text start="467.85" dur="7.77">it is now coming to an end it cannot be</text>
  <text start="471.81" dur="6.09">sustained and it&amp;#39;s falling apart we see</text>
  <text start="475.62" dur="6">the u.s. well they&amp;#39;re trying to come up</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="6.81">with all different reasons of why the US</text>
  <text start="481.62" dur="5.37">needs to stay in Syria and we see right</text>
  <text start="484.71" dur="4.74">now that Syria is out there saying</text>
  <text start="486.99" dur="4.71">listen in terms of the American</text>
  <text start="489.45" dur="4.83">intervention in Syria it needs</text>
  <text start="491.7" dur="4.86">legitimate backing by the Syrian</text>
  <text start="494.28" dur="6.21">government it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the UN</text>
  <text start="496.56" dur="5.94">says the Syrian government is still the</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="5.04">elected government it&amp;#39;s a sovereign</text>
  <text start="502.5" dur="5.22">country and the UN can tell you whatever</text>
  <text start="505.53" dur="4.35">you want to hear but it&amp;#39;s the country</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="4.53">that tells you if you&amp;#39;re allowed inside</text>
  <text start="509.88" dur="5.13">and it looks like that the United States</text>
  <text start="512.25" dur="6">might have broken or violated</text>
  <text start="515.01" dur="5.67">international law and we see right now</text>
  <text start="518.25" dur="5.219">they are continually asking them to</text>
  <text start="520.68" dur="6.57">leave Syria and it looks like Syria and</text>
  <text start="523.469" dur="6.091">Russia are going to go to the UN to ask</text>
  <text start="527.25" dur="4.35">the United States to leave now I think</text>
  <text start="529.56" dur="3.96">this was a trial balloon where Russia</text>
  <text start="531.6" dur="3.75">and Syria came out they wanted to test</text>
  <text start="533.52" dur="4.5">the waters to see how the United States</text>
  <text start="535.35" dur="4.95">was going to react and of course the</text>
  <text start="538.02" dur="4.68">Cabal doesn&amp;#39;t want to leave they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="540.3" dur="4.14">making up excuses and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.7" dur="4.05">going to happen is they&amp;#39;re gonna go to</text>
  <text start="544.44" dur="3.66">the UN and all the countries aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="546.75" dur="4.08">around the world they&amp;#39;re gonna say what</text>
  <text start="548.1" dur="4.62">is your legal reason for being in this</text>
  <text start="550.83" dur="4.38">country now of course they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="552.72" dur="5.51">to come up with something or they might</text>
  <text start="555.21" dur="5.25">even bring in another terrorist group</text>
  <text start="558.23" dur="3.61">which has paid mercenaries they&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="560.46" dur="4.41">take the Islamic state which they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="561.84" dur="5.43">been transporting to Libya regroup them</text>
  <text start="564.87" dur="3.99">rebrand them rename them introduce them</text>
  <text start="567.27" dur="4.05">and say well look what happened here</text>
  <text start="568.86" dur="6">Russia and Syria got rid of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="571.32" dur="5.82">state it created a vacuum this other</text>
  <text start="574.86" dur="4.65">terrorist groups stepped in and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="577.14" dur="5.19">called whatever they call it and we need</text>
  <text start="579.51" dur="5.88">to stay here to control the situation</text>
  <text start="582.33" dur="5.73">now they might try that tactic or they</text>
  <text start="585.39" dur="4.68">might try some type of an event</text>
  <text start="588.06" dur="6.09">we&amp;#39;re the Islamic state whoever is left</text>
  <text start="590.07" dur="6.3">there maybe uses that nuke that they set</text>
  <text start="594.15" dur="4.71">tactical nuke that they smuggled in from</text>
  <text start="596.37" dur="4.53">turkey into Aleppo and then who knows</text>
  <text start="598.86" dur="5.63">where it moved maybe they will use that</text>
  <text start="600.9" dur="6.75">as some type of last type of an event</text>
  <text start="604.49" dur="4.72">mechanism to stay in Syria so we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="607.65" dur="4.17">to watch that situation very very</text>
  <text start="609.21" dur="6.36">carefully we see the propaganda against</text>
  <text start="611.82" dur="6.51">North Korea is really ramping up and we</text>
  <text start="615.57" dur="4.41">see it all over the UK where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="618.33" dur="3.78">saying that cyber operations in North</text>
  <text start="619.98" dur="5.76">Korea have become the country&amp;#39;s new</text>
  <text start="622.11" dur="6.99">weapon of mass disruption and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="625.74" dur="6.99">saying that the cyber attacks from North</text>
  <text start="629.1" dur="6.84">Korea could increase the possibility of</text>
  <text start="632.73" dur="6.09">world war 3 now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="635.94" dur="5.34">about this is that the United States the</text>
  <text start="638.82" dur="6.27">Department of Homeland Security they</text>
  <text start="641.28" dur="5.82">have posted a warning about cyber</text>
  <text start="645.09" dur="4.38">attacks by North Korean government which</text>
  <text start="647.1" dur="5.4">it collectively refers to as hidden</text>
  <text start="649.47" dur="4.5">Cobra now the technical alert from the</text>
  <text start="652.5" dur="3.66">FBI and Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="653.97" dur="5.94">says a remote administration tool called</text>
  <text start="656.16" dur="7.53">rat called fall chill has been deployed</text>
  <text start="659.91" dur="7.02">by Hidden Cobra since 2016 to target the</text>
  <text start="663.69" dur="6.78">aerospace telecommunications finance</text>
  <text start="666.93" dur="5.94">industries and the infrastructure now</text>
  <text start="670.47" dur="4.35">fall chill allows hidden Cobra to issue</text>
  <text start="672.87" dur="3.72">commands to a victim&amp;#39;s server by dual</text>
  <text start="674.82" dur="3.66">proxies which means it can potentially</text>
  <text start="676.59" dur="5.51">perform actions like receiving</text>
  <text start="678.48" dur="7.67">information shutting down systems</text>
  <text start="682.1" dur="7.48">changing maybe the currency in a</text>
  <text start="686.15" dur="5.62">financial institution and the FBI and</text>
  <text start="689.58" dur="3.78">upon home security while they posted a</text>
  <text start="691.77" dur="3.6">list of IP addresses linked to the</text>
  <text start="693.36" dur="5.13">Hidden Cobra which is kind of ridiculous</text>
  <text start="695.37" dur="5.25">because if this is a state actor there</text>
  <text start="698.49" dur="5.37">is no way in the world that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="700.62" dur="5.34">going to use IP addresses in their</text>
  <text start="703.86" dur="3.57">country and we know that North Korea</text>
  <text start="705.96" dur="4.56">doesn&amp;#39;t have that many IP addresses so</text>
  <text start="707.43" dur="7.05">this makes no sense whatsoever so the</text>
  <text start="710.52" dur="8.81">FBI says it has high confidence that the</text>
  <text start="714.48" dur="6.93">IP addresses are linked to North Korea</text>
  <text start="719.33" dur="4.629">now they&amp;#39;re not saying</text>
  <text start="721.41" dur="4.409">they know for sure that they have actual</text>
  <text start="723.959" dur="4.44">evidence they&amp;#39;re saying high confidence</text>
  <text start="725.819" dur="4.531">which means they&amp;#39;re guessing which means</text>
  <text start="728.399" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re making this up which means</text>
  <text start="730.35" dur="6.659">they&amp;#39;re trying to create this propaganda</text>
  <text start="733.379" dur="5.431">that North Korea is coming after the</text>
  <text start="737.009" dur="3.27">United States the UK is doing the same</text>
  <text start="738.81" dur="6.06">thing and it looks like they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="740.279" dur="7.8">to build this up once again to scare</text>
  <text start="744.87" dur="6.449">everyone and to lay the groundwork to</text>
  <text start="748.079" dur="4.981">let everyone know that once the event</text>
  <text start="751.319" dur="3.27">starts and it looks like they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="753.06" dur="6.24">become so desperate they&amp;#39;re gonna need</text>
  <text start="754.589" dur="9.48">this event once it starts they need to</text>
  <text start="759.3" dur="7.82">show who actually did this now if or</text>
  <text start="764.069" dur="6.361">when we have this cyber attack event</text>
  <text start="767.12" dur="6.699">they&amp;#39;re gonna let us know in a couple of</text>
  <text start="770.43" dur="6.449">hours or one day because when they do</text>
  <text start="773.819" dur="5.401">this this whole operation so quickly</text>
  <text start="776.879" dur="4.051">like this it means they have everything</text>
  <text start="779.22" dur="4.5">planned and they need to let everyone</text>
  <text start="780.93" dur="4.829">know right away who it is so in their</text>
  <text start="783.72" dur="3.75">minds they can start thinking like oh my</text>
  <text start="785.759" dur="3.471">god North Korea&amp;#39;s cyber attack - oh my</text>
  <text start="787.47" dur="5.25">god North Korea is doing all of this</text>
  <text start="789.23" dur="5.5">there&amp;#39;s no way in the world that they</text>
  <text start="792.72" dur="4.38">can track down this type of an attack</text>
  <text start="794.73" dur="4.56">that quickly this is how you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="797.1" dur="4.109">completely fake phony and false think</text>
  <text start="799.29" dur="4.859">about if it was that easy to track down</text>
  <text start="801.209" dur="4.19">all this you wouldn&amp;#39;t get spam we would</text>
  <text start="804.149" dur="3.901">know where all the viruses were</text>
  <text start="805.399" dur="4.511">everything would be really easy and if</text>
  <text start="808.05" dur="5.099">you notice anything that&amp;#39;s from North</text>
  <text start="809.91" dur="7.619">Korea from Syria from Russia or China</text>
  <text start="813.149" dur="6.451">they know in like a split second I mean</text>
  <text start="817.529" dur="3.961">those emails that you get from Africa</text>
  <text start="819.6" dur="5.25">asking for money nobody knows where</text>
  <text start="821.49" dur="5.67">those come from other viruses malware&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="824.85" dur="3.87">that don&amp;#39;t come from the countries they</text>
  <text start="827.16" dur="3.84">have no idea where it comes from they</text>
  <text start="828.72" dur="4.589">can&amp;#39;t track it down it&amp;#39;s it takes a very</text>
  <text start="831" dur="4.17">long time to do this and especially a</text>
  <text start="833.309" dur="3.39">state actor they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="835.17" dur="3.599">bounce it off server after server after</text>
  <text start="836.699" dur="3.39">server so you can never figure out where</text>
  <text start="838.769" dur="3.601">it&amp;#39;s really coming from and believe me</text>
  <text start="840.089" dur="5.331">they&amp;#39;re not going to leave certain bits</text>
  <text start="842.37" dur="6.6">of code inside of whatever they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="845.42" dur="7.51">remember the CIA they have the ability</text>
  <text start="848.97" dur="5.429">to mimic malware viruses and make it</text>
  <text start="852.93" dur="2.31">look like it&amp;#39;s coming from a country so</text>
  <text start="854.399" dur="3.091">you can see right now</text>
  <text start="855.24" dur="5.43">that they are preparing for something</text>
  <text start="857.49" dur="4.68">much much larger and you can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="860.67" dur="3.6">laying the groundwork because they want</text>
  <text start="862.17" dur="3.66">everyone to know that North Korea does</text>
  <text start="864.27" dur="3.689">have the ability to do this now on the</text>
  <text start="865.83" dur="4.53">same hand they&amp;#39;re trying to start</text>
  <text start="867.959" dur="4.561">something with a Rand that really is not</text>
  <text start="870.36" dur="4.349">gonna go anywhere I mean unless they</text>
  <text start="872.52" dur="5.61">have some type of an amazing event Iran</text>
  <text start="874.709" dur="6.211">is not going to start a war they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="878.13" dur="4.89">going to push anything they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="880.92" dur="3.96">to do anything and of course Russia and</text>
  <text start="883.02" dur="3.18">China they&amp;#39;re gonna stop this actually</text>
  <text start="884.88" dur="2.459">Russia and China they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="886.2" dur="3.78">stop whatever is happening in North</text>
  <text start="887.339" dur="5.341">Korea also but what they can do with</text>
  <text start="889.98" dur="5.669">North Korea is they can say that yes</text>
  <text start="892.68" dur="6.24">they did cyberattack because that is a</text>
  <text start="895.649" dur="5.641">lot easier to show because you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="898.92" dur="5.31">have to show anything you just have to</text>
  <text start="901.29" dur="6.48">report it and all they have to do is</text>
  <text start="904.23" dur="5.669">show the FBI the NSA the CIA handover a</text>
  <text start="907.77" dur="3.66">report saying yes we have the IP</text>
  <text start="909.899" dur="3.69">addresses they can pull them out of the</text>
  <text start="911.43" dur="4.98">thin air because they know what the IP</text>
  <text start="913.589" dur="5.281">addresses are of North Korea they can</text>
  <text start="916.41" dur="3.739">show that and say yes we tracked it down</text>
  <text start="918.87" dur="3.57">we know who it is</text>
  <text start="920.149" dur="3.341">they&amp;#39;re the ones who attack the</text>
  <text start="922.44" dur="2.76">infrastructure they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="923.49" dur="3.63">attached who attacked the financial</text>
  <text start="925.2" dur="4.59">institutions and they really don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="927.12" dur="4.23">to prove anything and other countries</text>
  <text start="929.79" dur="3.78">around the world since they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="931.35" dur="5.31">hearing this information they will</text>
  <text start="933.57" dur="5.459">probably believe it because we can see</text>
  <text start="936.66" dur="6.15">what has been happening with North Korea</text>
  <text start="939.029" dur="6.151">right now we&amp;#39;re out in the press and the</text>

  <text start="948.42" dur="3.84">the United States we&amp;#39;re gonna go in</text>
  <text start="950.88" dur="3.959">there and have regime change and we can</text>
