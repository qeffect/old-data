  <text start="52.21" dur="5.73">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.02" dur="6.45">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.94" dur="7.789">episode 1670 and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="62.47" dur="6.24">3rd 2018 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.729" dur="6.311">confirmed the push is on to control the</text>
  <text start="68.71" dur="5.1">economic collapse narrative let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="72.04" dur="5.189">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.81" dur="5.04">news now we understand from all our</text>
  <text start="77.229" dur="3.78">research and from everything that we</text>
  <text start="78.85" dur="6.54">looked at and all the indicators that</text>
  <text start="81.009" dur="7.86">we&amp;#39;ve seen that the economy is going</text>
  <text start="85.39" dur="6.18">absolutely nowhere actually it&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="88.869" dur="4.5">gigantic illusion that the central</text>
  <text start="91.57" dur="5.25">bankers have created the deep state have</text>
  <text start="93.369" dur="7.101">created since the 2008 crisis and</text>
  <text start="96.82" dur="5.939">they&amp;#39;ve kept us in this illusion by</text>
  <text start="100.47" dur="4.3">manipulating the statistical information</text>
  <text start="102.759" dur="4.081">with unemployment and we&amp;#39;ve gone over</text>
  <text start="104.77" dur="4.17">this many many times before and many</text>
  <text start="106.84" dur="7.02">others have gone over this on how they</text>
  <text start="108.94" dur="7.77">manipulate unemployment GDP and how they</text>
  <text start="113.86" dur="5.31">started to create currency out of thin</text>
  <text start="116.71" dur="5.31">air to prop up the banking system and</text>
  <text start="119.17" dur="4.769">each central bank takes a turn with</text>
  <text start="122.02" dur="4.52">stimulus and of course they lower the</text>
  <text start="123.939" dur="5.671">interest rates and all of this was done</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="6.449">to make us think that the economy was</text>
  <text start="129.61" dur="7.08">doing well in the background of all this</text>
  <text start="132.989" dur="6.34">of all this manipulation the everyday</text>
  <text start="136.69" dur="5.94">person was feeling the effect of how the</text>
  <text start="139.329" dur="6.63">economy was not doing well and we talked</text>
  <text start="142.63" dur="6.3">about how retail was going to get hit</text>
  <text start="145.959" dur="5.101">remember 70% of GDP is made up of</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="5.58">individuals going out and purchasing</text>
  <text start="151.06" dur="6.54">goods and we know since there aren&amp;#39;t as</text>
  <text start="154.51" dur="6.15">many people working at these high paid</text>
  <text start="157.6" dur="5.07">full-time jobs and many people have</text>
  <text start="160.66" dur="4.47">part-time jobs where people have no work</text>
  <text start="162.67" dur="4.23">at all well they&amp;#39;re not gonna go out and</text>
  <text start="165.13" dur="5.76">spend the money like they did before</text>
  <text start="166.9" dur="6.809">I mean prior to 2008 prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="170.89" dur="5.159">people the actual American person was</text>
  <text start="173.709" dur="3.84">out there purchasing homes they were</text>
  <text start="176.049" dur="4.261">getting mortgages they were getting</text>
  <text start="177.549" dur="6.301">homes they had jobs and they were going</text>
  <text start="180.31" dur="5.8">out and purchasing after 2008 everything</text>
  <text start="183.85" dur="4.81">changed because</text>
  <text start="186.11" dur="6.48">that debt based system which were stolen</text>
  <text start="188.66" dur="5.4">today came to a screeching halt and the</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="4.44">central bankers they needed a way to</text>
  <text start="194.06" dur="6.33">create the solution once again and they</text>
  <text start="197.03" dur="5.3">needed to fool everyone moving forward</text>
  <text start="200.39" dur="5.64">so they could prepare to move the system</text>
  <text start="202.33" dur="5.2">to their new system and this is what</text>
  <text start="206.03" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;ve been planning on for a very long</text>
  <text start="207.53" dur="5.4">time and they wanted everything in place</text>
  <text start="210.89" dur="3.9">for their new system that their new</text>
  <text start="212.93" dur="3.45">system was going to be very very</text>
  <text start="214.79" dur="3.29">different than it is today</text>
  <text start="216.38" dur="5.07">and this is why they spent many years</text>
  <text start="218.08" dur="5.14">moving manufacturing and moving</text>
  <text start="221.45" dur="3.63">everything out of the United States and</text>
  <text start="223.22" dur="3.6">putting it in the emerging markets</text>
  <text start="225.08" dur="3.72">because they knew the emerging markets</text>
  <text start="226.82" dur="4.169">that was going to be the up-and-coming</text>
  <text start="228.8" dur="4.409">area of where they can move everything</text>
  <text start="230.989" dur="3.451">because labor was very low they know</text>
  <text start="233.209" dur="3.601">that they knew they can move</text>
  <text start="234.44" dur="3.99">manufacturing there and it would keep</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="5.13">the u.s. going for a little bit longer</text>
  <text start="238.43" dur="5.66">and as time went on everything started</text>
  <text start="241.94" dur="4.71">to break down very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="244.09" dur="5.14">every single country throughout the</text>
  <text start="246.65" dur="4.77">world started to add a lot of debt and</text>
  <text start="249.23" dur="4.16">the global debt has reached levels that</text>
  <text start="251.42" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;ve never ever seen before</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="6.43">now their whole system was based on a</text>
  <text start="256.76" dur="5.909">globalist system where they were going</text>
  <text start="259.82" dur="4.71">to take each country and level the</text>
  <text start="262.669" dur="3.541">playing field that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="264.53" dur="3.57">everyone was coming up to the level of</text>
  <text start="266.21" dur="4.59">the United States actually it was the</text>
  <text start="268.1" dur="5.4">opposite way everyone was going to come</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="5.85">down to the level of the emerging</text>
  <text start="273.5" dur="5.16">markets this way labor would be very</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="4.68">very cheap it would be an even playing</text>
  <text start="278.66" dur="5.88">field and they&amp;#39;d be able to move labor</text>
  <text start="281.33" dur="4.98">around the world very easily this was</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="3.93">the plan this is why they wanted the TPP</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="4.95">of course that was struck down that was</text>
  <text start="288.47" dur="5.31">a global system NAFTA was the beginning</text>
  <text start="291.26" dur="4.11">stages of this and they created</text>
  <text start="293.78" dur="4.17">different organizations like the World</text>
  <text start="295.37" dur="4.98">Trade Organization and we see right now</text>
  <text start="297.95" dur="5.69">when we mentioned this before that Trump</text>
  <text start="300.35" dur="6.87">is going up against the World Trade</text>
  <text start="303.64" dur="7.54">Organization and he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="6.21">WTO is not fair to the United States and</text>
  <text start="311.18" dur="3.75">they need to change their ways and I</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="6.52">think what he&amp;#39;s going to do eventually</text>
  <text start="314.93" dur="7.03">is get the United States out of the WTO</text>
  <text start="319.95" dur="3.95">once the United States starts to move</text>
  <text start="321.96" dur="4.65">out of all these different organizations</text>
  <text start="323.9" dur="5.68">the other country is kind of flounder</text>
  <text start="326.61" dur="5.31">because still the United States is in</text>
  <text start="329.58" dur="5.55">control of what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="331.92" dur="6.39">and I think at this point we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="335.13" dur="5.79">this huge dismantling of the globalist</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="4.65">system and it&amp;#39;s happening very slowly</text>
  <text start="340.92" dur="3.9">actually if you really think about it in</text>
  <text start="342.96" dur="3.93">the last two years it&amp;#39;s happening very</text>
  <text start="344.82" dur="4.38">quickly people would like to have it</text>
  <text start="346.89" dur="6.14">happen a lot faster but again it is</text>
  <text start="349.2" dur="7.23">happening right now and at every turn</text>
  <text start="353.03" dur="6.64">with bilateral trades with going after</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="6.15">the WTO with going after NAFTA by</text>
  <text start="359.67" dur="5.46">getting rid of TPP by continually doing</text>
  <text start="362.58" dur="5.49">these things what is happening here is</text>
  <text start="365.13" dur="5.43">that the central banking deep state</text>
  <text start="368.07" dur="4.08">globalist system is being ripped apart</text>
  <text start="370.56" dur="4.17">and this is why the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="372.15" dur="4.47">out there and they&amp;#39;re so angry about</text>
  <text start="374.73" dur="4.23">this and this is why they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="376.62" dur="6.98">pushing their agenda now what is their</text>
  <text start="378.96" dur="9.96">agenda their agenda is to control the</text>
  <text start="383.6" dur="8.95">entire narrative of this next collapse</text>
  <text start="388.92" dur="6.03">of the economy now the economy has not</text>
  <text start="392.55" dur="5.21">improved actually it&amp;#39;s gotten worse the</text>
  <text start="394.95" dur="4.74">only thing that has improved is the fake</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="4.63">manipulated statistical numbers they</text>
  <text start="399.69" dur="4.17">throw out at us and they can make it go</text>
  <text start="402.39" dur="2.85">any way they want they can make those</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="5.21">numbers go up they can make them go down</text>
  <text start="405.24" dur="7.29">they have nothing to do with reality and</text>
  <text start="409.07" dur="5.62">we&amp;#39;re already starting to see the</text>
  <text start="412.53" dur="3.48">mainstream media and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.69" dur="3.68">taking their orders from the deep state</text>
  <text start="416.01" dur="7.02">from the central bank to start pushing</text>
  <text start="418.37" dur="7.33">their propaganda their agenda for when</text>
  <text start="423.03" dur="4.2">this system comes down and we already</text>
  <text start="425.7" dur="4.2">mentioned that the Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="427.23" dur="4.44">was out there saying that the economy</text>
  <text start="429.9" dur="4.77">could see a recession in 2020 we</text>
  <text start="431.67" dur="5.07">discussed that yes this is their main</text>
  <text start="434.67" dur="4.26">plan now think about it they&amp;#39;ve tried</text>
  <text start="436.74" dur="4.83">getting Trump out of office with in</text>
  <text start="438.93" dur="5.1">Pietschmann he&amp;#39;s racist and all these</text>
  <text start="441.57" dur="4.65">other things but it didn&amp;#39;t work the only</text>
  <text start="444.03" dur="3.42">thing they have left right now and our</text>
  <text start="446.22" dur="2.85">Russian collusion and all the other</text>
  <text start="447.45" dur="4.22">stuff the only thing they have left</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="4.71">right now is to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="451.67" dur="4.33">before the presidential</text>
  <text start="453.78" dur="5.04">action and it looks like this is what</text>
  <text start="456" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re planning on right now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="458.82" dur="8.37">starting to see that other mainstream</text>
  <text start="461.31" dur="10.2">media publications are beginning to put</text>
  <text start="467.19" dur="7.29">their narrative forward to let everyone</text>
  <text start="471.51" dur="7.47">know that the economy is starting to</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="7.5">slip this is coming out of the New York</text>
  <text start="478.98" dur="6.75">Post where they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="481.98" dur="6.45">economy isn&amp;#39;t booming as much as Trump</text>
  <text start="485.73" dur="5.75">says now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is when</text>
  <text start="488.43" dur="6.06">Obama was president and the economy was</text>
  <text start="491.48" dur="4.51">you know the same under him they never</text>
  <text start="494.49" dur="4.59">really mentioned any of this stuff</text>
  <text start="495.99" dur="4.679">actually if you really look at it with</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="3.69">the fake statistical numbers if we just</text>
  <text start="500.669" dur="5.881">want to use that because remember these</text>
  <text start="502.77" dur="6.36">these numbers that Trump is using these</text>
  <text start="506.55" dur="4.7">are these are the central bankers that</text>
  <text start="509.13" dur="6.2">deep state numbers he hasn&amp;#39;t changed</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="8.83">anything there so really they are</text>
  <text start="515.33" dur="7.149">reporting on their own numbers the</text>
  <text start="520.08" dur="4.92">numbers they&amp;#39;ve been using that tell us</text>
  <text start="522.479" dur="4.981">that we&amp;#39;ve been in a recovery they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="525" dur="5.22">using the same exact manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="527.46" dur="7.11">to tell us that the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="530.22" dur="6.96">well so the article went on to say that</text>
  <text start="534.57" dur="4.71">consumer spending just wasn&amp;#39;t coming in</text>
  <text start="537.18" dur="5.159">where the government hope despite the</text>
  <text start="539.28" dur="5.97">tax cut now that&amp;#39;s a dig at what Trump</text>
  <text start="542.339" dur="4.591">has done with the tax cut because it</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="4.08">didn&amp;#39;t put more money into the pockets</text>
  <text start="546.93" dur="4.38">of the people and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="549.33" dur="4.95">continually bring up all these different</text>
  <text start="551.31" dur="5.52">things to show that everything that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="554.28" dur="7.98">done is not working they weren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="556.83" dur="9.48">to work the economy cannot be fixed this</text>
  <text start="562.26" dur="7.38">is a central banking system it was</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="6">designed to fail it fails every single</text>
  <text start="569.64" dur="4.59">time yes they have the ability to keep</text>
  <text start="572.31" dur="4.2">things going this is the last stage of</text>
  <text start="574.23" dur="3.81">them trying to keep the entire system</text>
  <text start="576.51" dur="4.86">together this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="578.04" dur="5.58">warnings from the IMF from the biz from</text>
  <text start="581.37" dur="5.49">everywhere else saying that yet the</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="4.02">global debt is too high Europe needs a</text>
  <text start="586.86" dur="1.92">rainy day</text>
  <text start="587.64" dur="3.78">because they see what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="588.78" dur="4.59">the brexit and Italy the business saying</text>
  <text start="591.42" dur="4.59">a lot of the banks are using the same</text>
  <text start="593.37" dur="4.47">Lehman style manipulation on their books</text>
  <text start="596.01" dur="6.27">and the banks aren&amp;#39;t as strong as they</text>
  <text start="597.84" dur="5.79">say this is all part of the plan now</text>
  <text start="602.28" dur="2.82">they were going to use a completely</text>
  <text start="603.63" dur="4.44">different plan they were going to have a</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="4.26">major major event to distract from what</text>
  <text start="608.07" dur="4.35">was coming but they don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="609.36" dur="6.36">anymore so they have to resort to the</text>
  <text start="612.42" dur="5.73">next phase the next phase is to blame</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="4.89">this on Trump and do it before the</text>
  <text start="618.15" dur="5.28">presidential election to make sure that</text>
  <text start="620.61" dur="4.86">he doesn&amp;#39;t stay in office I mean this is</text>
  <text start="623.43" dur="4.83">their their goal since the beginning to</text>
  <text start="625.47" dur="5.01">make sure the president didn&amp;#39;t stay in</text>
  <text start="628.26" dur="4.35">office so we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="630.48" dur="4.5">corporate media they are out there and</text>

  <text start="666.05" dur="5.38">they&amp;#39;re going to bring it down now again</text>
  <text start="669.06" dur="5.88">this is about controlling the narrative</text>
  <text start="671.43" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s about controlling the system coming</text>
  <text start="674.94" dur="4.08">down because whoever can control it who</text>
  <text start="677.25" dur="4.65">Evan can control the narrative whoever</text>
  <text start="679.02" dur="7.05">can control the story they will control</text>
  <text start="681.9" dur="6.21">the entire situation and we see right</text>
  <text start="686.07" dur="4.83">now they&amp;#39;re going to try to do this</text>
  <text start="688.11" dur="6.45">before the next election so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
