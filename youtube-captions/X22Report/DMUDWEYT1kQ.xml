  <text start="112.3" dur="4.49">individuals doing anything you have to</text>
  <text start="114.91" dur="4.14">understand their mindset</text>
  <text start="116.79" dur="4.24">many of these people on the higher level</text>
  <text start="119.05" dur="3.96">they believe they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="121.03" dur="6.3">untouchable they believe that nothing</text>
  <text start="123.01" dur="6.779">will ever get them and because of this</text>
  <text start="127.33" dur="4.56">mentality they believe they don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="129.789" dur="4.73">to go anywhere they don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="131.89" dur="6.45">think about it because all these years</text>
  <text start="134.519" dur="6.731">nothing has ever happened to them they</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="5.479">believe they&amp;#39;re above the law they</text>
  <text start="141.25" dur="6.54">believe that people have no power</text>
  <text start="143.819" dur="7.361">there&amp;#39;s no reason to run if we run that</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="4.47">makes us look guilty but you can see</text>
  <text start="151.18" dur="5.07">that there are certain individuals</text>
  <text start="152.26" dur="7.199">within DC that are panicking they</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="5.849">realize something is not right they</text>
  <text start="159.459" dur="3.661">realize things are not going in the</text>
  <text start="162.099" dur="5.151">right direction</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="8.19">I mean if you look at Kamala Harris and</text>
  <text start="167.25" dur="7.319">many others they&amp;#39;re going off the deep</text>
  <text start="171.31" dur="7.47">end they&amp;#39;re worried they&amp;#39;re afraid and</text>
  <text start="174.569" dur="5.741">she was giving a speech to the Human</text>
  <text start="178.78" dur="4.44">Rights Campaign fundraiser in Los</text>
  <text start="180.31" dur="4.44">Angeles and she said something very</text>
  <text start="183.22" dur="6.629">interesting and this should tell you</text>
  <text start="184.75" dur="8.549">quite a bit that individuals in DC they</text>
  <text start="189.849" dur="9.39">are worried I won&amp;#39;t say anymore just</text>
  <text start="193.299" dur="10.981">take a listen to what she said we win</text>
  <text start="199.239" dur="8.731">and so I say this to say that these last</text>
  <text start="204.28" dur="6.75">two years and some months have certainly</text>
  <text start="207.97" dur="6.62">caused a lot of us to start speaking to</text>
  <text start="211.03" dur="7.65">an inanimate object called a television</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="6.58">and to shout at that thing it has caused</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="6.809">a lot of us to go through individual and</text>
  <text start="221.17" dur="8.09">group therapy it has caused a lot of us</text>
  <text start="225.489" dur="9.541">to to feel a bit of despair and</text>
  <text start="229.26" dur="7.15">depression and anxiety and fear now did</text>
  <text start="235.03" dur="5.789">you hear her voice</text>
  <text start="236.41" dur="9.84">it was almost shaking did you hear what</text>

  <text start="246.25" dur="8.609">they&amp;#39;re panicking and they need help</text>
  <text start="251.069" dur="7.271">this is panic you can hear it in her</text>
  <text start="254.859" dur="8.071">voice they were afraid of what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="258.34" dur="6.6">to happen and they might put on a happy</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="4.83">face out in public like there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="264.94" dur="5.43">wrong we not we might see Hillary</text>
  <text start="267.76" dur="5.219">Clinton she isn&amp;#39;t running we might see</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="4.71">Comey not running out her colder Sally</text>
  <text start="272.979" dur="5.461">Yates and the rest all sitting by</text>
  <text start="275.08" dur="5.07">because in their minds they believe they</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="5.039">can&amp;#39;t be touched but somewhere back in</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="7.079">the corner of their brain they are</text>
  <text start="283.479" dur="6.181">worrying because they realize there are</text>
  <text start="287.229" dur="5.131">certain investigations going on they</text>
  <text start="289.66" dur="5.71">realize that if Trump stays in office</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="5.35">longer and longer</text>
  <text start="295.37" dur="5.07">well this is not going to be a good</text>
  <text start="297.71" dur="4.17">scenario for them and this is why</text>
  <text start="300.44" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;ve been trying everything they</text>
  <text start="301.88" dur="5.94">possibly can to get him out of office</text>
  <text start="304.01" dur="5.82">but it&amp;#39;s not working it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="307.82" dur="4.17">they don&amp;#39;t have other tricks up their</text>
  <text start="309.83" dur="3.78">sleeves which I do believe they have I</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="4.95">think we&amp;#39;re not finished</text>

  <text start="322.12" dur="4.83">what do you think they&amp;#39;re planning on</text>
  <text start="324.5" dur="4.59">what do you think they&amp;#39;re working on you</text>
  <text start="326.95" dur="6.36">think they&amp;#39;re just gonna let that be</text>
  <text start="329.09" dur="9.18">released no they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="333.31" dur="8.53">sabotage the new cycle they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="338.27" dur="9.269">to block everyone from seeing it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.84" dur="8.99">gonna try their last resort that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="347.539" dur="7.041">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to do now</text>
  <text start="350.83" dur="6.55">representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez</text>
  <text start="354.58" dur="5.95">it looks like she&amp;#39;s still in a bit of</text>
  <text start="357.38" dur="5.909">trouble here because on Wednesday the</text>
  <text start="360.53" dur="4.68">Coolidge Reagan foundation a First</text>
  <text start="363.289" dur="3.711">Amendment watchdog filed another</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="4.86">complaint against representative</text>
  <text start="367" dur="9.419">Alexandria Ocasio Cortez this time</text>
  <text start="370.07" dur="9.98">targeting her campaign manager and this</text>
  <text start="376.419" dur="7.291">complaint consists of 50 pages and</text>
  <text start="380.05" dur="9.04">levying more than 20 counts against</text>
  <text start="383.71" dur="7.269">Ocasio Cortez and her manager and the</text>
  <text start="389.09" dur="4.56">entities they created to carry out an</text>
  <text start="390.979" dur="5.12">unlawful dark money scheme the complaint</text>
  <text start="393.65" dur="5.01">provides the most in-depth analysis of</text>
  <text start="396.099" dur="5.111">Ocasio Cortez&amp;#39;s various campaign</text>
  <text start="398.66" dur="4.35">finances violations to date and of</text>
  <text start="401.21" dur="4.44">course she&amp;#39;s saying this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="403.01" dur="5.19">completely bogus that now this is not</text>
  <text start="405.65" dur="4.41">true you have nothing on me but</text>
  <text start="408.2" dur="6.529">according to the complaint filed with</text>
  <text start="410.06" dur="8.97">the FEC in March two pax founded by</text>
  <text start="414.729" dur="6.581">Ocasio Cortez top aide funneled over 1</text>
  <text start="419.03" dur="6.33">million in political donations into two</text>
  <text start="421.31" dur="6.66">of his own private companies so there</text>
  <text start="425.36" dur="5.55">seems to be a problem here</text>
  <text start="427.97" dur="4.8">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re digging deeper</text>
  <text start="430.91" dur="5.46">and deeper and they&amp;#39;re finding more and</text>
  <text start="432.77" dur="7.41">more about what they have done and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.37" dur="7.53">all coming to light we see that Nadler</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="6.12">went ahead and they had the vote to</text>
  <text start="443.9" dur="5.16">subpoena the Muller report they want it</text>
  <text start="446.3" dur="3.45">completely unredacted they want the full</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="3.63">report</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="4.77">because Barr didn&amp;#39;t comply with the</text>
  <text start="452.69" dur="4.44">April 2nd deadlines and anyone think he</text>
  <text start="454.52" dur="5.76">was going to comply no he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="457.13" dur="7.95">give the report with redactions some</text>
  <text start="460.28" dur="8.49">type sometime in April and I&amp;#39;m happy</text>
  <text start="465.08" dur="7.62">that Barr didn&amp;#39;t bow down to Nadler and</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="6.72">this ridiculous request because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.7" dur="5.67">bars job to make sure that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.49" dur="6.09">nothing nothing sensitive in this report</text>
  <text start="478.37" dur="7.08">and he needs to read or read it over and</text>
  <text start="481.58" dur="5.46">he needs to review it most likely the</text>
  <text start="485.45" dur="5.49">report will be completely transparent</text>
  <text start="487.04" dur="7.08">and just like George papadopolis tweeted</text>
  <text start="490.94" dur="5.31">out I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to be what</text>
  <text start="494.12" dur="4.53">they think it&amp;#39;s going to be I think</text>
  <text start="496.25" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;re still working on old Intel that</text>
  <text start="498.65" dur="6.18">Muller was doing everything they wanted</text>
  <text start="502.79" dur="4.02">where they went down where he went down</text>
  <text start="504.83" dur="4.56">all these different paths they have all</text>
  <text start="506.81" dur="4.8">the documentation of Trump spending here</text>
  <text start="509.39" dur="4.079">Trump&amp;#39;s money going this way what the</text>
  <text start="511.61" dur="3.63">Russians were doing and I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="513.469" dur="3.991">it&amp;#39;s really gonna contain what they</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="3.9">think it&amp;#39;s going to contain I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="517.46" dur="3.12">gonna be something completely opposite</text>
  <text start="519.14" dur="3.74">and they&amp;#39;re going to be shocked just</text>
  <text start="520.58" dur="5.79">like when the Muller summary came out</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="6.04">they were all defending why they were</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="5.1">right and now they&amp;#39;re still defending</text>
  <text start="528.92" dur="6.15">why they&amp;#39;re right where while they order</text>
  <text start="531.47" dur="6.869">this report now of course they want this</text>
  <text start="535.07" dur="5.94">to be stuck in court they want to keep</text>
  <text start="538.339" dur="5.461">this out in the public they&amp;#39;re using it</text>
  <text start="541.01" dur="4.61">as their firewall but it&amp;#39;s going to fail</text>
  <text start="543.8" dur="5.07">how do they how does Trump at the pages</text>
  <text start="545.62" dur="5.11">completely beat all this they make it</text>
  <text start="548.87" dur="2.76">transparent and say you didn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="550.73" dur="4.109">do that we&amp;#39;re gonna give it to you</text>
  <text start="551.63" dur="5.88">anyhow we were just baiting you and you</text>
  <text start="554.839" dur="4.771">fell for it here&amp;#39;s the report read it</text>

  <text start="559.61" dur="3.97">Meadows is out there he&amp;#39;s accusing</text>
  <text start="561.66" dur="6.51">of playing politics in their attempt to</text>
  <text start="563.58" dur="6.18">subpoena the report from Muller and he</text>
  <text start="568.17" dur="3.3">says the report found no evidence of</text>
  <text start="569.76" dur="4.35">collusion between the campaign of Trump</text>
  <text start="571.47" dur="5.07">and Russia and this is according to the</text>

  <text start="706.48" dur="5.299">ham radio to Congress and this is coming</text>
  <text start="708.459" dur="6.211">out of the conservative tree house and</text>
  <text start="711.779" dur="4.24">it always seemed kind of sketchy that at</text>

  <text start="738.22" dur="5.91">looked like it was May 23rd 2016 but</text>

  <text start="1008.12" dur="3.63">remain at large I believe there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1010.4" dur="5.79">more than this and I believe this is why</text>
  <text start="1011.75" dur="6.9">the president wants a census Miller gave</text>

  <text start="1037.22" dur="4.41">long time and has not been utilized so I</text>
  <text start="1040.13" dur="3.21">think what they&amp;#39;re doing and they said</text>
  <text start="1041.63" dur="5.25">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re going back</text>
  <text start="1043.34" dur="6.24">in time and they&amp;#39;re going to use all the</text>
  <text start="1046.88" dur="6.09">laws that are on the books those laws</text>
  <text start="1049.58" dur="5.07">that were created by the Democrats laws</text>
  <text start="1052.97" dur="4.92">that were created by the Republicans and</text>
  <text start="1054.65" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re going to use these laws against</text>

  <text start="1062.3" dur="4.02">well this was created by this individual</text>
  <text start="1064.67" dur="4.77">this one was created by this individual</text>
  <text start="1066.32" dur="4.89">I mean these are your laws that you</text>
  <text start="1069.44" dur="4.5">wanted on the books we&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="1071.21" dur="5.99">them now and of course waiting to see</text>
  <text start="1073.94" dur="6.39">what happens once they push this forward</text>
  <text start="1077.2" dur="5.62">we see out in New Zealand it looks like</text>
  <text start="1080.33" dur="5.16">they are following through on gun</text>
  <text start="1082.82" dur="7.16">control they&amp;#39;re passing the laws that</text>
  <text start="1085.49" dur="7.26">are going to basically ban all semiotic</text>
  <text start="1089.98" dur="4.65">semi-automatic weapons and shotguns now</text>
  <text start="1092.75" dur="5.269">remember this is</text>
  <text start="1094.63" dur="5.429">the poster child of what the United</text>
  <text start="1098.019" dur="3.9">States is trying to do it and wants to</text>
  <text start="1100.059" dur="3.421">do and when I say the United States I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1101.919" dur="4.681">talking about those deep state players</text>
  <text start="1103.48" dur="6.449">they want to remove all the weapons and</text>
  <text start="1106.6" dur="5.99">they use New Zealand as the poster child</text>
  <text start="1109.929" dur="4.98">to say see look what you can do it is</text>
  <text start="1112.59" dur="4.9">possible and you hear certain</text>
  <text start="1114.909" dur="4.201">individuals within government saying we</text>
  <text start="1117.49" dur="3.48">should follow this actually you hear</text>
  <text start="1119.11" dur="5.46">mainstream media saying we should follow</text>
  <text start="1120.97" dur="7.829">this and they&amp;#39;re trying to use this as a</text>
  <text start="1124.57" dur="6.9">case and they&amp;#39;re trying to say we should</text>
  <text start="1128.799" dur="5.701">do the same thing we see out in</text>
  <text start="1131.47" dur="5.1">Venezuela Maduro he is now allowing the</text>
  <text start="1134.5" dur="4.32">Red Cross to distribute aid in his</text>
  <text start="1136.57" dur="4.92">country now I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="1138.82" dur="4.949">Russia has sent some military personnel</text>
  <text start="1141.49" dur="5.34">not many people but he might feel a</text>
  <text start="1143.769" dur="4.591">little bit more secure in Venezuela by</text>
  <text start="1146.83" dur="3.63">the way that story of China sending</text>
  <text start="1148.36" dur="4.26">troops into Venezuela that&amp;#39;s fake phony</text>
  <text start="1150.46" dur="4.38">and false and it reminds me of the story</text>
  <text start="1152.62" dur="4.889">when they said that China was sending</text>
  <text start="1154.84" dur="6.99">troops into Syria for some reason there</text>
  <text start="1157.509" dur="7.65">is no article or any type of source that</text>
  <text start="1161.83" dur="5.88">backs this up at all and China is</text>
  <text start="1165.159" dur="3.691">denying it they denied it in Syria it</text>
  <text start="1167.71" dur="3.63">wasn&amp;#39;t true the dunna</text>
  <text start="1168.85" dur="6.419">denying it in Venezuela so it looks like</text>
