  <text start="732.06" dur="5.34">no plans to rebuild Libya cities or</text>
  <text start="735" dur="4.95">critical infrastructure after they</text>
  <text start="737.4" dur="5.25">destroy it with all the bombs so what</text>
  <text start="739.95" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that both United States</text>
  <text start="742.65" dur="5.52">and Europe they haven&amp;#39;t offered any</text>
  <text start="745.02" dur="5.7">detailed plans for how they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="748.17" dur="4.31">rebuild everything they destroy well I</text>
  <text start="750.72" dur="5.94">know it how it&amp;#39;s all going to be done</text>
  <text start="752.48" dur="8.26">like it&amp;#39;s been done in the past the loan</text>
  <text start="756.66" dur="6.09">the government money put them into debt</text>
  <text start="760.74" dur="6.15">because this is what the central bankers</text>
  <text start="762.75" dur="7.92">do they make money during a war they</text>
  <text start="766.89" dur="6.84">make money after the war it&amp;#39;s not about</text>
  <text start="770.67" dur="5.01">the people it&amp;#39;s about how much they make</text>
  <text start="773.73" dur="4.89">and this is what they&amp;#39;re doing now of</text>
  <text start="775.68" dur="5.28">course as we know out in Libya the air</text>
  <text start="778.62" dur="4.08">strikes are going to continue we know</text>
  <text start="780.96" dur="3.27">that Obama authorized it for 30 days but</text>
  <text start="782.7" dur="4.53">we know this is going to go a lot longer</text>
  <text start="784.23" dur="5.16">than this we also realize that they said</text>
  <text start="787.23" dur="4.95">there will be no boots on the ground in</text>
  <text start="789.39" dur="4.95">Libya and we already know there are</text>
  <text start="792.18" dur="4.83">boots on the ground we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="794.34" dur="4.35">special operation forces we know the</text>

  <text start="801" dur="4.2">other coalition forces are in this</text>

  <text start="812.85" dur="7.97">intelligence to go after not the Islamic</text>
  <text start="816.51" dur="7.95">state but to go after those governments</text>
  <text start="820.82" dur="5.41">that will not be a part of the unity</text>
  <text start="824.46" dur="3.629">government because those governments are</text>
  <text start="826.23" dur="4.62">the elected governments the unity</text>
  <text start="828.089" dur="5.19">government was created by the UN the</text>
  <text start="830.85" dur="4.62">United States and the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="833.279" dur="3.99">pushed on the people saying this is your</text>
  <text start="835.47" dur="5.76">government so the people had no say in</text>
  <text start="837.269" dur="6.48">this how is this democracy it isn&amp;#39;t so</text>
  <text start="841.23" dur="6.45">we have boots on the ground and they are</text>
  <text start="843.749" dur="6.51">all over the country providing</text>
  <text start="847.68" dur="5.73">intelligence for these airstrikes to</text>
  <text start="850.259" dur="5.94">keep the unity government in power out</text>
  <text start="853.41" dur="7.549">in turkey we see turkey is now moving</text>
  <text start="856.199" dur="8.041">closer and closer to Russia but turkey</text>
  <text start="860.959" dur="8.92">they are looking at the european union</text>

  <text start="906.449" dur="5.19">do this in one to two years because as</text>
  <text start="909.029" dur="5.61">we know Putin and her one they are</text>

  <text start="914.639" dur="4.38">between Russia and Turkey turkey is</text>
  <text start="916.529" dur="3.87">getting closer and closer and the</text>

  <text start="1137.12" dur="3.6">doing all along they&amp;#39;ve been morphing</text>
  <text start="1139.19" dur="3.93">the moderate rebels into the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1140.72" dur="3.96">state if they miss lot if the Islamic</text>

  <text start="1152.45" dur="6.57">move them around the chessboard hoping</text>
  <text start="1155.36" dur="7.32">that no one will notice and we know the</text>
  <text start="1159.02" dur="6.69">u.s. is continually dropping weapons to</text>
  <text start="1162.68" dur="5.37">all of these terrorist groups we know</text>
  <text start="1165.71" dur="5.88">the US air drop weapons into the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1168.05" dur="8.67">state hands and a very strange story</text>
  <text start="1171.59" dur="7.77">came out where the u.s. well they</text>
  <text start="1176.72" dur="4.26">abandoned their weapons when they came</text>
  <text start="1179.36" dur="2.76">under fire now it&amp;#39;s all over the</text>
  <text start="1180.98" dur="3.72">corporate media and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1182.12" dur="4.53">explain away how the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="1184.7" dur="4.47">the other terrorist groups got the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1186.65" dur="4.2">made weapons well first of all the</text>
  <text start="1189.17" dur="4.79">United States have been giving them the</text>
  <text start="1190.85" dur="6.15">weapons dropping them from planes and</text>
  <text start="1193.96" dur="6.64">then we see this story come out where</text>
  <text start="1197" dur="6.15">they found an ID card and there were</text>
  <text start="1200.6" dur="4.53">weapons along with it where did they get</text>
  <text start="1203.15" dur="6.45">this from so they had to come up with a</text>
  <text start="1205.13" dur="6.48">story to say oh the US troops they were</text>
  <text start="1209.6" dur="4.29">under attack they let their weapons go</text>
  <text start="1211.61" dur="5.04">they just dropped them and they ran well</text>
  <text start="1213.89" dur="6.18">if we think back to when the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1216.65" dur="6.96">state first appeared in Iraq what was</text>
  <text start="1220.07" dur="6.84">the story back then when the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1223.61" dur="7.38">state moved into my soul the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="1226.91" dur="8.6">soldiers dropped all the us-made weapons</text>
  <text start="1230.99" dur="7.94">and the Islamic state picked them up</text>
  <text start="1235.51" dur="6.58">this is the propaganda they are using</text>
  <text start="1238.93" dur="5.92">when they are caught they make up all of</text>
  <text start="1242.09" dur="4.71">these stories and then during this whole</text>
  <text start="1244.85" dur="5.22">entire period when the Islamic state was</text>
  <text start="1246.8" dur="5.91">growing there was footage actually the</text>
  <text start="1250.07" dur="4.65">Iraqi generals noticed that the United</text>
  <text start="1252.71" dur="6.09">States was dropping weapons for the</text>
  <text start="1254.72" dur="6.96">Islamic state because the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1258.8" dur="4.59">al Qaeda al-nusrah they&amp;#39;re all part of</text>
  <text start="1261.68" dur="4.71">the proxy army of the United States</text>
  <text start="1263.39" dur="5.58">government central bankers now is really</text>
  <text start="1266.39" dur="5.34">intelligence they intercepted</text>
  <text start="1268.97" dur="5.31">communications between the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1271.73" dur="4.62">and other various groups where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1274.28" dur="5.22">planning to hit us bases in Kuwait</text>
  <text start="1276.35" dur="6.75">Bahrain Saudi Arabia and this really</text>
  <text start="1279.5" dur="5.91">sounds like a PSYOP because if the</text>
  <text start="1283.1" dur="4.29">Islamic state actually attacks the US</text>
  <text start="1285.41" dur="5.07">air base we know right there and then</text>
  <text start="1287.39" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s a false flag and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1290.48" dur="3.93">interesting is every time these</text>
  <text start="1291.98" dur="4.59">intelligent intelligence agencies come</text>
  <text start="1294.41" dur="4.35">out with all these warnings that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1296.57" dur="5.28">going to be a terrorist attack here or</text>
  <text start="1298.76" dur="4.92">there you notice they never happen they</text>
  <text start="1301.85" dur="4.8">only happen when they don&amp;#39;t mention</text>
  <text start="1303.68" dur="6.57">anything or they have no reports of a</text>
  <text start="1306.65" dur="6.57">terrorist attack occurring and the</text>
  <text start="1310.25" dur="5.04">reason for this is because these are</text>
  <text start="1313.22" dur="5.19">planned from the inside remember the</text>
  <text start="1315.29" dur="4.26">Islamic state al Qaeda al-nusrah they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1318.41" dur="4.95">all part of the United States government</text>
  <text start="1319.55" dur="8.19">central bankers the operatives take care</text>
  <text start="1323.36" dur="6.66">of handling the next event and when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1327.74" dur="3.9">an inside job they never have any</text>
  <text start="1330.02" dur="4.68">information they didn&amp;#39;t even see it</text>
  <text start="1331.64" dur="4.92">coming but they report on all the other</text>
  <text start="1334.7" dur="4.32">propaganda that there could be a</text>
  <text start="1336.56" dur="5.91">terrorist attack here there could be one</text>
  <text start="1339.02" dur="5.6">here and it never happens it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="1342.47" dur="6.42">the ones where they have no information</text>
  <text start="1344.62" dur="6.13">that we see this shootout in San</text>
  <text start="1348.89" dur="6.54">Bernardino which turns out to be a false</text>
  <text start="1350.75" dur="9.2">flag we see other shootouts in Dallas we</text>
  <text start="1355.43" dur="7.01">see other areas in France in Germany</text>
  <text start="1359.95" dur="6.81">because all of these are done and</text>
  <text start="1362.44" dur="4.32">created from within and</text>
  <text start="1367.02" dur="3.38">they&amp;#39;re never going to find the</text>
  <text start="1368.16" dur="5.73">information because they&amp;#39;re all in on it</text>
  <text start="1370.4" dur="6.76">so there&amp;#39;s nothing to report and they</text>
  <text start="1373.89" dur="7.59">need to convince you that we need more</text>
  <text start="1377.16" dur="6.02">laws to secure everything we need to</text>

  <text start="1388.19" dur="7.27">provide every single American with a</text>
  <text start="1391.89" dur="7.31">weapon and guess what everyone will be</text>
  <text start="1395.46" dur="7.44">safe from the terrorists because if that</text>
  <text start="1399.2" dur="7.78">terrorists which we know is an inside</text>
  <text start="1402.9" dur="6.36">job enters a club and every person is</text>

  <text start="1416.99" dur="7.18">nothing will happen but they don&amp;#39;t want</text>

  <text start="1424.17" dur="6.81">to think in that way out in Germany out</text>
  <text start="1428.55" dur="4.44">in France people are calling we will we</text>
  <text start="1430.98" dur="5.31">want weapons if there is terrorists</text>
