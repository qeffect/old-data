  <text start="92.95" dur="4.5">once again and they couldn&amp;#39;t get the</text>
  <text start="95.35" dur="4.47">market where they wanted it to go the</text>
  <text start="97.45" dur="5.28">market closed down today gold is down a</text>
  <text start="99.82" dur="5.97">little bit and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="102.73" dur="4.47">now it&amp;#39;s getting more more difficult for</text>
  <text start="105.79" dur="3.98">the high-frequency traders the plunge</text>
  <text start="107.2" dur="6.03">protection team to keep the market up as</text>
  <text start="109.77" dur="6.1">hard as they work there are those who</text>
  <text start="113.23" dur="4.92">are selling off and the only way the</text>
  <text start="115.87" dur="5.01">market is staying up right now is with</text>
  <text start="118.15" dur="4.35">the creation of free money and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120.88" dur="4.11">taking this for your money and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="122.5" dur="5.25">putting it into the market that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="124.99" dur="5.129">the plunge protection team does they</text>
  <text start="127.75" dur="4.29">have an allotment of funds and they take</text>
  <text start="130.119" dur="4.831">it and they put it into the market to</text>
  <text start="132.04" dur="6.059">keep it up so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="134.95" dur="6.69">now is that whatever their allotment is</text>
  <text start="138.099" dur="6.631">it&amp;#39;s not enough they need more of it and</text>
  <text start="141.64" dur="9.179">this is why Yellen is out there talking</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="9.42">about more money printing creating more</text>
  <text start="150.819" dur="5.7">currency to the tune of four trillion or</text>
  <text start="154.15" dur="5.099">maybe more because they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="156.519" dur="4.771">realize that as this market continually</text>
  <text start="159.249" dur="4.41">collapses it&amp;#39;s going to become more more</text>
  <text start="161.29" dur="3.06">difficult to keep this entire system</text>
  <text start="163.659" dur="3.391">alive</text>
  <text start="164.35" dur="6.18">and one we look at all these economic</text>
  <text start="167.05" dur="6.84">indicators we are seeing the total</text>
  <text start="170.53" dur="5.82">destruction of this economy I mean we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="173.89" dur="6.99">been tracking this and everyone has to</text>
  <text start="176.35" dur="7.38">understand how this works the central</text>
  <text start="180.88" dur="5.76">bankers they keep the illusion alive as</text>
  <text start="183.73" dur="5.97">long as they possibly can it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="6">you wake up tomorrow and the system was</text>
  <text start="189.7" dur="4.76">fine one day and collapse the next day I</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="5.19">mean this is what many people believe</text>
  <text start="194.46" dur="5.98">they believe that a look we were fine</text>
  <text start="197.83" dur="4.59">one day and all of a sudden it collapsed</text>
  <text start="200.44" dur="4.14">and then these people come out who say</text>
  <text start="202.42" dur="5.28">you know oh you&amp;#39;ve been telling us about</text>
  <text start="204.58" dur="6.18">the collapse of the system well it</text>
  <text start="207.7" dur="5.61">doesn&amp;#39;t work the way everyone thinks it</text>
  <text start="210.76" dur="4.62">works what they do is they keep the</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="4.5">illusion alive as long as possible and</text>
  <text start="215.38" dur="4.8">sometimes it goes for two years</text>
  <text start="217.81" dur="4.41">sometimes it goes for five years but</text>
  <text start="220.18" dur="5.85">what we&amp;#39;re doing right now is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="8.46">tracking all of these years to show how</text>
  <text start="226.03" dur="7.59">it&amp;#39;s coming down because when it does</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="5.25">come down and the market collapses it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.62" dur="5.76">not because the economy was fine one day</text>
  <text start="235.93" dur="5.49">and terrible the next what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="239.38" dur="6.09">is is that the illusion is being ripped</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="6.21">apart over these years and the economy</text>
  <text start="245.47" dur="3.45">is continually deteriorating and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="247.63" dur="4.05">talking about the stock market I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="248.92" dur="4.92">talking about manufacturing I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="251.68" dur="4.17">about retail I&amp;#39;m talking about people</text>
  <text start="253.84" dur="5.31">who who are employed who are unemployed</text>
  <text start="255.85" dur="5.91">now I&amp;#39;m talking about everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="8.28">going on in this country rail traffic</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="8.58">trucking bulk dry shipping corporate</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="5.63">defaults that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="270.34" dur="5.49">and slowly as they built the illusion up</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="4.39">the illusion starts to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="275.83" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been tracking we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="277.45" dur="4.44">watching it slowly fall apart and when</text>
  <text start="279.61" dur="5.42">we get to that point when it collapses</text>
  <text start="281.89" dur="8.01">it was because the system has already</text>
  <text start="285.03" dur="7.6">collapsed and this is the last part of</text>
  <text start="289.9" dur="5.579">it which is the stock market so when</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="5.059">people say well the system hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="295.479" dur="6.381">collapsed well no</text>
  <text start="297.689" dur="7.141">it it&amp;#39;s a build-up and we reach this</text>
  <text start="301.86" dur="4.889">certain point where this system cannot</text>
  <text start="304.83" dur="3.479">be sustained anymore and they know it</text>
  <text start="306.749" dur="3.96">and they have to bring it down or</text>
  <text start="308.309" dur="3.66">something comes out of left field and it</text>
  <text start="310.709" dur="3.36">brings it down for them think about what</text>
  <text start="311.969" dur="7.34">happened during 2008 with the subprime</text>
  <text start="314.069" dur="7.44">crisis this just didn&amp;#39;t happen overnight</text>
  <text start="319.309" dur="4.51">one day it was fine the next day it was</text>
  <text start="321.509" dur="3.93">bad this was a buildup people were</text>
  <text start="323.819" dur="3.51">continually defaulting on their</text>
  <text start="325.439" dur="4.08">mortgages people were continually buying</text>
  <text start="327.329" dur="4.62">more houses people were continually</text>
  <text start="329.519" dur="4.591">defaulting the illusion was kept alive</text>
  <text start="331.949" dur="5.34">with raiding these subprime securities</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="5.94">with triple-a triple-a no they&amp;#39;re fine</text>
  <text start="337.289" dur="4.8">the market continually rose the market</text>
  <text start="340.05" dur="5.099">continually rose and this went on for</text>
  <text start="342.089" dur="4.97">many years in the meantime we had</text>
  <text start="345.149" dur="5.901">bubbles all over the place and</text>
  <text start="347.059" dur="8.59">eventually what happened is the illusion</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="9.389">met the real collapsing of the economy</text>
  <text start="355.649" dur="6.99">and we had the whole thing implode and</text>
  <text start="360.439" dur="5.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing happened</text>
  <text start="362.639" dur="6.12">once again when we look at this economy</text>
  <text start="365.879" dur="4.59">right now we see that the Fed is saying</text>
  <text start="368.759" dur="5.46">that there&amp;#39;s no inflation whatsoever but</text>
  <text start="370.469" dur="9.51">we do see inflation we see inflation in</text>
  <text start="374.219" dur="10.831">rentals we see inflation in medical</text>
  <text start="379.979" dur="8.19">costs we see inflation in housing we see</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="5.759">inflation in all of these areas other</text>
  <text start="388.169" dur="4.68">areas they&amp;#39;re able to control think</text>
  <text start="390.809" dur="3.96">about why they lower the fuel prices</text>
  <text start="392.849" dur="4.79">there are many agendas associated with</text>
  <text start="394.769" dur="6.98">this once they lower fuel prices</text>
  <text start="397.639" dur="9.161">shipping becomes less expensive</text>
  <text start="401.749" dur="8.29">production becomes less expensive and if</text>
  <text start="406.8" dur="6.929">it&amp;#39;s less expensive the prices of the</text>
  <text start="410.039" dur="6.39">goods they don&amp;#39;t rise they can actually</text>
  <text start="413.729" dur="7.26">stay the same or fall if you shrink a</text>
  <text start="416.429" dur="6.9">prior a product and you remove the</text>
  <text start="420.989" dur="6.48">number of ounces or remove the number of</text>
  <text start="423.329" dur="6.48">tissues or napkins and sell it for the</text>
  <text start="427.469" dur="3.811">same price well it doesn&amp;#39;t look like</text>
  <text start="429.809" dur="3.721">inflation but it</text>
  <text start="431.28" dur="5.94">and these are all the tricks they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="433.53" dur="6.24">used so we&amp;#39;ve seen inflation and what</text>
  <text start="437.22" dur="6">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the core</text>
  <text start="439.77" dur="5.61">CPI it&amp;#39;s serg x plus two point three</text>
  <text start="443.22" dur="4.86">percent year-on-year this is the highest</text>
  <text start="445.38" dur="5.37">since 2008 this is the tenth month in a</text>
  <text start="448.08" dur="6.02">row above the feds mandate of two</text>
  <text start="450.75" dur="9.15">percent stable growth and we see that</text>
  <text start="454.1" dur="9.13">rentals homes there are three point</text>
  <text start="459.9" dur="8.28">eight percent inflation we see medical</text>
  <text start="463.23" dur="8.46">services continually rising so we are</text>
  <text start="468.18" dur="5.52">seeing inflation we see the University</text>
  <text start="471.69" dur="5.37">of Michigan their survey results are</text>
  <text start="473.7" dur="6.12">showing that the people are looking at</text>
  <text start="477.06" dur="6.57">the economy and they believe the</text>
  <text start="479.82" dur="6.06">conditions are getting worse and we can</text>
  <text start="483.63" dur="5.07">see right now they have dropped</text>
  <text start="485.88" dur="4.92">dramatically from about a hundred and</text>
  <text start="488.7" dur="4.35">eleven points down to a hundred and</text>
  <text start="490.8" dur="6.39">three point five this is the lowest</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="5.46">since october of 2015 because people are</text>
  <text start="497.19" dur="3.42">starting to wake up they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="498.51" dur="5.73">realize there&amp;#39;s something dramatically</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="6.78">wrong here we know that europe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="504.24" dur="5.07">in crisis mode right now italy right now</text>
  <text start="507.39" dur="4.08">has been in crisis for at least eight</text>
  <text start="509.31" dur="4.229">months even though the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="511.47" dur="4.379">they didn&amp;#39;t want to recognize anything</text>
  <text start="513.539" dur="4.05">until about july but they were having</text>
  <text start="515.849" dur="3.951">problems way before this and it has</text>
  <text start="517.589" dur="6.081">nothing to do with the brexit whatsoever</text>
  <text start="519.8" dur="7.24">they have high performing levels of</text>
  <text start="523.67" dur="6.79">non-performing loans and this has been a</text>
  <text start="527.04" dur="5.91">problem for quite a while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.46" dur="7.98">carrying loans that are non performing</text>
  <text start="532.95" dur="11.46">and they&amp;#39;re actually defaulting on these</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="8.58">NPLs rather than writing them off and we</text>
  <text start="544.41" dur="6.92">can see right now that seventeen percent</text>
  <text start="547.02" dur="6.96">of italy loans will not be repaid and</text>
  <text start="551.33" dur="6.509">this is going to crush the italian</text>
  <text start="553.98" dur="8.13">banking system now the only way to help</text>
  <text start="557.839" dur="6.171">italy is with a government bailout but</text>
  <text start="562.11" dur="4.36">there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="564.01" dur="6.12">Italy is not only part of the EU but</text>
  <text start="566.47" dur="5.72">part of the eurozone and such they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="570.13" dur="4.53">print their way out of this crisis and</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="5.29">EU regulations make it difficult for the</text>
  <text start="574.66" dur="4.86">government to bail out banks so what do</text>
  <text start="577.48" dur="4.05">they have they have something called a</text>
  <text start="579.52" dur="3.18">bail-in which means they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="581.53" dur="5.07">going after the depositors and</text>
  <text start="582.7" dur="7.95">accreditors and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="586.6" dur="7.14">that the italian banks they are</text>
  <text start="590.65" dur="6.15">deteriorating very quickly and actually</text>
  <text start="593.74" dur="6.02">when you look at Europe and Germany we</text>
  <text start="596.8" dur="6.77">see that there&amp;#39;s a real threat here</text>
  <text start="599.76" dur="7.24">because if the u.s. goes into recession</text>
  <text start="603.57" dur="6.3">Europe collapses because we know that</text>
  <text start="607" dur="6.9">Germany and other countries in the EU</text>
  <text start="609.87" dur="7.8">they&amp;#39;ve been shifting their exports to</text>
  <text start="613.9" dur="7.62">the US if the u.s. goes into recession</text>
  <text start="617.67" dur="8.88">demand for German goods French goods and</text>
  <text start="621.52" dur="9.33">other European goods it drops and a</text>
  <text start="626.55" dur="7.48">small percentage drop in exports well</text>
  <text start="630.85" dur="6.66">guess what that&amp;#39;s going to destroy the</text>
  <text start="634.03" dur="7.44">European countries and we can see right</text>
  <text start="637.51" dur="7.83">now the United States is already in a</text>
  <text start="641.47" dur="5.61">recession right now Europe is reeling</text>
  <text start="645.34" dur="4.08">now of course there&amp;#39;s no announcement</text>
  <text start="647.08" dur="4.28">from the government they&amp;#39;re keeping this</text>
  <text start="649.42" dur="4.77">quiet because the government if you</text>
  <text start="651.36" dur="5.34">study how they report on recessions they</text>
  <text start="654.19" dur="6.75">don&amp;#39;t report on recessions until maybe</text>
  <text start="656.7" dur="6.64">69 a year later and they say oh yeah by</text>
  <text start="660.94" dur="6.24">the way the recession really started you</text>
  <text start="663.34" dur="5.85">know 2016 of January but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="667.18" dur="4.5">report it right off the bat even when</text>
  <text start="669.19" dur="6.27">we&amp;#39;re entering a recession they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="671.68" dur="5.37">like to report it now Angela Merkel said</text>
  <text start="675.46" dur="4.65">the European Union is in a critical</text>
  <text start="677.05" dur="5.73">situation because even though it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="680.11" dur="4.62">mentioned that we&amp;#39;re in a recession they</text>
  <text start="682.78" dur="3.99">still see that the demand for their</text>
  <text start="684.73" dur="6.9">goods is dropping and dropping very</text>
  <text start="686.77" dur="8.01">quickly and they realize that they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="691.63" dur="5.49">a tough situation and what she&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="694.78" dur="3.1">right now is they need to come up with</text>
  <text start="697.12" dur="3.67">some type of</text>
  <text start="697.88" dur="5.13">solution because they realize that their</text>
  <text start="700.79" dur="6.24">economies are starting to take a dive</text>
  <text start="703.01" dur="6.3">and the situation is going to get worse</text>
  <text start="707.03" dur="4.11">and worse as time goes on because there</text>
  <text start="709.31" dur="3.3">was a study saying that there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="711.14" dur="4.53">eighty eight percent chance that were</text>
  <text start="712.61" dur="4.95">headed into a recession from what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="715.67" dur="4.02">looking at and from all these economic</text>
  <text start="717.56" dur="4.83">indicators we&amp;#39;ve been in a recession for</text>
  <text start="719.69" dur="6.72">quite a while and actually the recession</text>
  <text start="722.39" dur="5.43">is moving into a depression now of</text>
  <text start="726.41" dur="4.44">course they can keep the illusion up</text>
  <text start="727.82" dur="5.49">just like they did prior to 2008 we were</text>
  <text start="730.85" dur="5.79">in this recession before the stock</text>
  <text start="733.31" dur="9.24">market crashed in 2008 we were in a</text>
  <text start="736.64" dur="8.94">recession the beginning of 2008 but they</text>
  <text start="742.55" dur="5.58">kept the illusion alive they made</text>
  <text start="745.58" dur="4.08">everyone think that no no we&amp;#39;re not a</text>
  <text start="748.13" dur="3.45">recession even though these banks and</text>

  <text start="764.66" dur="7.44">same situation but it&amp;#39;s much much worse</text>
  <text start="768.89" dur="4.95">think about what happened in 2008 it</text>
  <text start="772.1" dur="3.36">affected like something like thirty</text>
  <text start="773.84" dur="3.66">eight percent of the population here in</text>

  <text start="777.5" dur="5.97">wealth their house they never found the</text>
  <text start="780.23" dur="5.31">same type of job again and here we are</text>
  <text start="783.47" dur="4.59">eight years later now those people never</text>
  <text start="785.54" dur="5.16">really recovered they never went out and</text>
  <text start="788.06" dur="4.59">purchased another big house they might</text>
  <text start="790.7" dur="3.87">have purchased a smaller house they</text>
  <text start="792.65" dur="4.44">might just continually rent they have</text>
  <text start="794.57" dur="5.31">two three four part-time jobs more</text>
  <text start="797.09" dur="6">people being laid off today this is the</text>
  <text start="799.88" dur="6.54">second round and when this second round</text>
  <text start="803.09" dur="6.39">of this collapsed hits it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="806.42" dur="4.95">a complete disaster because it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="809.48" dur="4.2">to wipe out all those that were hit</text>
  <text start="811.37" dur="4.38">first and all those people that weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="813.68" dur="5.1">hit well they&amp;#39;re going to get hit hit</text>
  <text start="815.75" dur="7.55">this time and it&amp;#39;s going to be horrific</text>
  <text start="818.78" dur="7.8">and we can see right now that we are</text>
  <text start="823.3" dur="6.64">accelerating the pace of this economic</text>
  <text start="826.58" dur="4.66">deterioration it is not getting better</text>
  <text start="829.94" dur="4.209">it is gay</text>
  <text start="831.24" dur="4.73">worse and the powers that be the elite</text>
  <text start="834.149" dur="6.991">the central bankers they all know this</text>
  <text start="835.97" dur="7.36">they realize where we are headed and we</text>
  <text start="841.14" dur="5.13">can see that perfect storm is coming up</text>
  <text start="843.33" dur="5.43">this fall does it mean we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="846.27" dur="4.53">have a collapse this fall well we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="848.76" dur="4.86">know if something comes out of left</text>
  <text start="850.8" dur="4.65">field that they don&amp;#39;t you know something</text>
  <text start="853.62" dur="4.23">they don&amp;#39;t expect yes it will bring it</text>
  <text start="855.45" dur="5.1">down but they&amp;#39;re planning on doing it</text>
  <text start="857.85" dur="4.88">themselves and I mentioned it yesterday</text>
  <text start="860.55" dur="5.22">where it&amp;#39;s going to be a two-parter</text>
  <text start="862.73" dur="5.35">because they want to bring it down</text>
  <text start="865.77" dur="4.65">because they need more control and the</text>
  <text start="868.08" dur="6.36">only way that they can get more control</text>
  <text start="870.42" dur="7.47">is to have an event and this event would</text>
  <text start="874.44" dur="6.54">be an economic crisis this way they can</text>
  <text start="877.89" dur="5.79">use the economic crisis to push</text>
  <text start="880.98" dur="5.57">legislation in their favor of course</text>
  <text start="883.68" dur="5.21">because they need to make things better</text>
  <text start="886.55" dur="4.77">doesn&amp;#39;t matter how many people are hurt</text>
  <text start="888.89" dur="4.3">doesn&amp;#39;t matter how many jobs are lost</text>
  <text start="891.32" dur="4.92">doesn&amp;#39;t matter how many companies are</text>

  <text start="896.24" dur="4.95">lose their money in the banking system</text>
  <text start="898.5" dur="7.26">because of balance that doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="901.19" dur="8.649">their whole agenda right now is to have</text>
  <text start="905.76" dur="9.15">this economic crisis to push certain</text>
  <text start="909.839" dur="8.761">legislation through to take more control</text>
  <text start="914.91" dur="8.04">of the economy because they know they</text>
  <text start="918.6" dur="6.69">can&amp;#39;t depend on the people they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="922.95" dur="4.29">depend on the people to boost this</text>
  <text start="925.29" dur="4.65">economy because people have no jobs</text>
  <text start="927.24" dur="4.909">people aren&amp;#39;t spending manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="929.94" dur="6.03">a disaster put all the pieces together</text>
  <text start="932.149" dur="7.81">the only way it can stay afloat is if</text>
  <text start="935.97" dur="8.27">the central bank goes out and has their</text>
  <text start="939.959" dur="6.541">hand in every aspect of the economy</text>
  <text start="944.24" dur="6.13">while the people sit on the sidelines</text>
  <text start="946.5" dur="8.82">and the only way to do this is to have</text>
  <text start="950.37" dur="10.209">an event a crisis and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="955.32" dur="7.209">coming and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="960.579" dur="6.141">if it happens maybe this year or next</text>
