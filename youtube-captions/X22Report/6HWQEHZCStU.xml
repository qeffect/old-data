  <text start="73.509" dur="4.321">central bank of all central bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="75.729" dur="4.89">came out with a report today letting</text>
  <text start="77.83" dur="6.48">everyone know that cryptocurrencies can</text>
  <text start="80.619" dur="5.25">never be a currency and they created a</text>
  <text start="84.31" dur="4.5">document it&amp;#39;s called cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="85.869" dur="4.231">looking beyond the hype and it was</text>
  <text start="88.81" dur="4.05">released by the Bank of International</text>
  <text start="90.1" dur="6.18">Settlements and it explains the history</text>
  <text start="92.86" dur="6.179">behind the technology and analyzes</text>
  <text start="96.28" dur="6">cryptocurrencies to see if it can</text>
  <text start="99.039" dur="5.37">actually become a currency and when you</text>
  <text start="102.28" dur="4.07">really think about this the central bank</text>
  <text start="104.409" dur="5.641">who doesn&amp;#39;t want to give up control of</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="6.159">their currency system is analyzing</text>
  <text start="110.05" dur="5.519">another currency system and letting you</text>
  <text start="112.509" dur="4.741">know that it&amp;#39;s not a currency that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="115.569" dur="4.351">pretty much what they said because of</text>
  <text start="117.25" dur="4.92">volatility scalability it will bring</text>
  <text start="119.92" dur="4.74">down the internet they&amp;#39;re using every</text>
  <text start="122.17" dur="4.17">single excuse now think about what the</text>
  <text start="124.66" dur="5.04">central banks have done since the</text>
  <text start="126.34" dur="8.28">beginning they demonized cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="129.7" dur="7.47">they had a huge amount of dumps which</text>
  <text start="134.62" dur="4.29">made Bitcoin volatile and remember</text>
  <text start="137.17" dur="3.3">bitcoin is not all of cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="138.91" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s the one that everyone knows about</text>
  <text start="140.47" dur="5.129">and this is the one that they could use</text>
  <text start="142.93" dur="5.52">to make everything look unstable and</text>
  <text start="145.599" dur="4.741">basically this is what they&amp;#39;ve done now</text>
  <text start="148.45" dur="4.89">they demonized it they made it look</text>
  <text start="150.34" dur="5.46">volatile and they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="153.34" dur="4.32">that this can never be a currency this</text>
  <text start="155.8" dur="3.9">is why the Fed was out there many</text>
  <text start="157.66" dur="4.439">different Talking Heads were saying that</text>
  <text start="159.7" dur="4.92">yeah this doesn&amp;#39;t meet a currency</text>
  <text start="162.099" dur="3.901">standard now again this is coming from a</text>
  <text start="164.62" dur="3.75">central bank they don&amp;#39;t want to give up</text>
  <text start="166" dur="4.319">control they love control and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.37" dur="4.41">trying to tell you that there is no</text>
  <text start="170.319" dur="4.681">other system but theirs which is</text>
  <text start="172.78" dur="4.02">absolutely ridiculous remember do you</text>
  <text start="175" dur="4.2">really think the biz was going to come</text>
  <text start="176.8" dur="5.54">out with a report saying hey crypto</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="6.34">currencies this is a perfect currency</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="5.06">solution we should all move to it</text>
  <text start="185.54" dur="3.449">you should drop what we&amp;#39;re using right</text>
  <text start="187.4" dur="4.619">now no of course not</text>
  <text start="188.989" dur="5.64">even if you created another currency</text>
  <text start="192.019" dur="5.071">that they didn&amp;#39;t control they would tell</text>
  <text start="194.629" dur="4.651">you that that currency was no good and</text>
  <text start="197.09" dur="5.819">even even if you made it out of paper</text>
  <text start="199.28" dur="4.829">and ink and it was centralized and you</text>
  <text start="202.909" dur="3.03">were creating it and the government</text>
  <text start="204.109" dur="3.21">supported it and the private western</text>
  <text start="205.939" dur="3.181">central banking system didn&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="207.319" dur="4.53">they would tell you that that currency</text>
  <text start="209.12" dur="5.1">is not a real currency that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="211.849" dur="4.2">adopt that you need to adopt there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.22" dur="4.079">this is what they&amp;#39;ve done in the past</text>
  <text start="216.049" dur="5.851">this is what they&amp;#39;re doing right now and</text>
  <text start="218.299" dur="6.961">once again the central banks they do not</text>
  <text start="221.9" dur="6.959">dictate to us what is or isn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="225.26" dur="5.699">currency the people decide what they</text>
  <text start="228.859" dur="4.291">would like to use and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.959" dur="5.28">trying to do right now is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="233.15" dur="5.61">to basically stop what is about to</text>
  <text start="236.239" dur="5.131">happen they don&amp;#39;t want people to decide</text>
  <text start="238.76" dur="4.77">they want to decide for you so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.37" dur="4.89">heading this off with this report and</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="5.039">this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing now</text>
  <text start="246.26" dur="4.92">Jack Dorsey he came out and he did a</text>
  <text start="248.569" dur="4.56">little tweeting and he basically</text>
  <text start="251.18" dur="3.63">mentioned something called a cash app</text>
  <text start="253.129" dur="5.22">where you can go and you can purchase</text>
  <text start="254.81" dur="5.31">Bitcoin and sell Bitcoin this is I think</text>
  <text start="258.349" dur="4.531">in New York and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="6.049">cryptocurrency that it jumped but once</text>
  <text start="262.88" dur="7.11">again what is happening here is more</text>
  <text start="266.169" dur="6.071">vendors more corporations they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="269.99" dur="4.23">looking at cryptocurrency because first</text>
  <text start="272.24" dur="4.14">of all it&amp;#39;s not difficult to adopt</text>
  <text start="274.22" dur="4.47">second of all it doesn&amp;#39;t use as much</text>
  <text start="276.38" dur="4.74">energy as everyone thinks think about</text>
  <text start="278.69" dur="5.07">all the electronic appliances in your</text>
  <text start="281.12" dur="4.019">house that where you basically the way</text>
  <text start="283.76" dur="3.029">you think they&amp;#39;re off they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="285.139" dur="4.321">they&amp;#39;re all still running even though</text>
  <text start="286.789" dur="5.491">you shut down the power they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="289.46" dur="6.72">still on draining energy do a little</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="5.609">experiment for a couple of weeks unplug</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="4.59">everything when you want to turn it off</text>
  <text start="297.889" dur="4.681">and at the end of the month do it for</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="4.47">like a month or so and see what your</text>
  <text start="302.57" dur="6.18">electric bill is so your TV your DVD</text>
  <text start="305.24" dur="7.56">player your computer unplug the power</text>
  <text start="308.75" dur="6.719">cable completely check it all out see if</text>
  <text start="312.8" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;re using a lot of power just with</text>
  <text start="315.469" dur="3.211">these devices now think about it think</text>
  <text start="317.12" dur="2.22">about how many people have the phones</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="2.49">that compute</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="4.14">and all these other devices running all</text>
  <text start="321.17" dur="4.29">the time even though you think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.48" dur="4.14">off they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re still draining</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="5.04">power and multiply that by the number of</text>
  <text start="327.62" dur="6.27">homes compared to the number of people</text>
  <text start="330.5" dur="6.63">that are mining crypto currencies so you</text>
  <text start="333.89" dur="4.68">can see right now everyone is using a</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="4.2">lot of electrical power but what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="4.74">doing is they&amp;#39;re using this as an excuse</text>
  <text start="341.33" dur="4.02">because they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="3.63">way to divert everyone away from</text>
  <text start="345.35" dur="3.69">cryptocurrencies this has been their</text>
  <text start="346.94" dur="4.26">plan since the beginning and this is why</text>
  <text start="349.04" dur="2.91">they came out with this report and if</text>
  <text start="351.2" dur="2.49">you want to know more about</text>
  <text start="351.95" dur="3.63">cryptocurrencies you want to learn about</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="3.6">cryptocurrencies you can go to the</text>
  <text start="355.58" dur="4.11">cryptocurrency school which is at the</text>
  <text start="357.29" dur="4.2">x-22 report school calm and we&amp;#39;ll bring</text>

  <text start="366.8" dur="6.38">everything to you now here in the United</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="5.58">States we understand that the economy is</text>
  <text start="373.18" dur="4.12">not doing well we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this</text>
  <text start="376.19" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the</text>
  <text start="377.3" dur="4.35">statistical information even the fake</text>
  <text start="379.46" dur="4.92">information that the government puts out</text>
  <text start="381.65" dur="4.32">the Fed puts out and even the corporate</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="3.6">media is reporting on all these</text>
  <text start="385.97" dur="3.69">manipulated numbers to make us think</text>
  <text start="387.98" dur="3.48">that everything is great but when we</text>
  <text start="389.66" dur="3.84">start to look at what is really going on</text>

  <text start="401.48" dur="6">out with this annual report and what</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re saying is that there&amp;#39;s a gap</text>

  <text start="410.51" dur="4.11">across the United States now I don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="416.51" dur="3.69">a very long time</text>
  <text start="417.32" dur="7.11">remember there&amp;#39;s bubbles in the market</text>

  <text start="589.85" dur="3.87">high-paying jobs they completely</text>
  <text start="591.68" dur="4.44">disappeared now these individuals have</text>

  <text start="600.47" dur="6">using the gig economy or gig jobs where</text>
  <text start="604.28" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re having side jobs where they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="608.33" dur="2.91">things in eBay or Etsy or things like</text>
  <text start="610.82" dur="2.85">that</text>
  <text start="611.24" dur="6.72">trying to make ends meet but for many it</text>
  <text start="613.67" dur="6.9">is not working whatsoever now we</text>
  <text start="617.96" dur="7.86">understand that the housing market is in</text>
  <text start="620.57" dur="7.86">big trouble and banks well they are</text>
  <text start="625.82" dur="5.01">pulling back from mortgage lending right</text>
  <text start="628.43" dur="4.14">now I wonder why they&amp;#39;re doing that well</text>
  <text start="630.83" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re doing that because they</text>
  <text start="632.57" dur="3.21">understand there&amp;#39;s going to be major</text>
  <text start="634.34" dur="3.39">problems and they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="635.78" dur="4.71">holding all of these mortgages they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="637.73" dur="4.59">done this before and they know that when</text>
  <text start="640.49" dur="4.08">the next crisis hits they can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="642.32" dur="5.37">holding all these mortgages so the</text>
  <text start="644.57" dur="5.4">shadow banking system well that has</text>
  <text start="647.69" dur="5.07">become very very aggressive and in the</text>
  <text start="649.97" dur="4.55">first quarter of 2018 banks and non-bank</text>

  <text start="836.52" dur="5.85">cover this all up with some type of war</text>

  <text start="847.95" dur="5">realize that time is ticking down</text>
  <text start="850.88" dur="4.17">and they realized they can&amp;#39;t keep the</text>
  <text start="852.95" dur="5.7">system going much longer remember the</text>
  <text start="855.05" dur="6.87">American public is 70 percent of GDP</text>
  <text start="858.65" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s based on spending and if people</text>

  <text start="870.02" dur="2.82">these individuals are not gonna go out</text>
  <text start="871.43" dur="3.69">and start spending money like crazy</text>

  <text start="913.25" dur="4.35">drunk miller the billionaire investor</text>
  <text start="915.56" dur="5.52">believes that this is the time when</text>
  <text start="917.6" dur="4.89">everyone needs to own gold and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="921.08" dur="5.52">saying that all other investments are</text>
  <text start="922.49" dur="7.11">rubbish right now so he&amp;#39;s looking at the</text>
  <text start="926.6" dur="5.46">situation and he&amp;#39;s saying that yet we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="929.6" dur="6.81">in big trouble here and people need to</text>
  <text start="932.06" dur="8.16">basically ensure their assets and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="936.41" dur="5.46">saying gold is the way to go now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="940.22" dur="4.86">very interesting is that Russia is</text>
  <text start="941.87" dur="6.11">selling off Treasuries other countries</text>
  <text start="945.08" dur="7.53">are selling off Treasuries Japan China</text>
  <text start="947.98" dur="7.48">the question is who&amp;#39;s buying them so</text>
  <text start="952.61" dur="4.98">when we look at this we can see that the</text>
  <text start="955.46" dur="4.71">largest holders of US Treasuries after</text>
  <text start="957.59" dur="5.82">China and Japan are Island at 300</text>
  <text start="960.17" dur="6.48">billion Brazil 294 billion UK at 263</text>
  <text start="963.41" dur="5.13">billion and the list goes on so who</text>
  <text start="966.65" dur="4.92">holds the rest of the US gross</text>
  <text start="968.54" dur="5.19">national debt by the end of April to</text>
  <text start="971.57" dur="4.38">stay within the same time frame of the</text>
  <text start="973.73" dur="3.99">tick data the US gross national debt</text>
  <text start="975.95" dur="4.17">have reached 21 point zero seven</text>
  <text start="977.72" dur="4.11">trillion this was up by one point to two</text>
  <text start="980.12" dur="4.3">trillion from a year earlier</text>
  <text start="981.83" dur="5.29">so who bought this one point two two</text>
  <text start="984.42" dur="4.71">trillion of new new US Treasuries</text>
  <text start="987.12" dur="4.7">someone must have we know it wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="989.13" dur="7.47">Fed because they&amp;#39;re unwinding right now</text>
  <text start="991.82" dur="6.34">so where did this go well we look at</text>
  <text start="996.6" dur="4.229">this we see the Treasury Holdings fell</text>
  <text start="998.16" dur="5.609">by 70 billion from the beginning of QE</text>
  <text start="1000.829" dur="6.181">unwind through April foreign Holdings</text>
  <text start="1003.769" dur="5.671">have only picked up 109 billion over the</text>
  <text start="1007.01" dur="4.56">period which leaves one point zero one</text>
  <text start="1009.44" dur="5.82">trillion that someone else must have</text>
  <text start="1011.57" dur="6.509">bought over those 12 months but who well</text>
  <text start="1015.26" dur="5.28">it was American institutional and</text>
  <text start="1018.079" dur="4.801">individual investors directly and</text>
  <text start="1020.54" dur="5.34">indirectly through bond funds pension</text>
  <text start="1022.88" dur="5.549">funds and other ways so basically the</text>
  <text start="1025.88" dur="6.48">American people have been purchasing</text>
  <text start="1028.429" dur="9.181">these Treasuries so the American people</text>
  <text start="1032.36" dur="6.93">are holding the debt of the US I mean</text>
  <text start="1037.61" dur="4.199">this is going to be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="1039.29" dur="6">disaster because once this system goes</text>
  <text start="1041.809" dur="5.76">down and everyone gets out of the</text>
  <text start="1045.29" dur="6.05">Treasuries they&amp;#39;re gonna be worth</text>
  <text start="1047.569" dur="6.751">absolutely nothing look at Argentina and</text>
  <text start="1051.34" dur="5.11">all these pension funds and all these</text>
  <text start="1054.32" dur="4.41">investments and all these things that</text>
  <text start="1056.45" dur="6.63">are wrapped up they&amp;#39;re gonna be worth</text>
  <text start="1058.73" dur="5.85">absolutely nothing and we can see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1063.08" dur="3.66">getting closer to this point in time</text>
  <text start="1064.58" dur="5.13">where this whole thing is going to start</text>
  <text start="1066.74" dur="6.66">collapsing I mean the global bond curve</text>
  <text start="1069.71" dur="6.48">just inverted and if you look at this</text>
  <text start="1073.4" dur="5.25">every time that this has happened what</text>
  <text start="1076.19" dur="5.16">happened to the global economy we went</text>
  <text start="1078.65" dur="4.22">into a recession that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1081.35" dur="5.88">going to happen this time</text>
  <text start="1082.87" dur="9.46">so the question is how do you destroy</text>
  <text start="1087.23" dur="6.9">the central banking system how do you</text>
  <text start="1092.33" dur="6.089">get rid of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="1094.13" dur="6.15">well you do it by destroying their</text>
  <text start="1098.419" dur="4.621">currency and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="1100.28" dur="4.83">dollar the dollar is the central bank</text>
  <text start="1103.04" dur="4.35">currency look at your dollar bill the</text>
  <text start="1105.11" dur="6.03">ten dollar bill it says Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="1107.39" dur="6.87">Note it&amp;#39;s an instrument of debt so right</text>
  <text start="1111.14" dur="4.44">now the dollar is in demand this is only</text>
  <text start="1114.26" dur="3.57">because the current system has been</text>
  <text start="1115.58" dur="3.599">propped up by the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="1117.83" dur="4.11">all the stimulus and everything like</text>
  <text start="1119.179" dur="4.561">that if the Fed continues to cut assets</text>
  <text start="1121.94" dur="3.15">and raise interest rates the emerging</text>
  <text start="1123.74" dur="3.99">markets and others will look elsewhere</text>
  <text start="1125.09" dur="4.38">for support the dollar is only valuable</text>
  <text start="1127.73" dur="4.23">to global markets so long as the Fed</text>
  <text start="1129.47" dur="5.819">continues to provide a perpetual supply</text>
  <text start="1131.96" dur="5.339">of liquidity major foreign economies</text>
  <text start="1135.289" dur="4.201">like China and parts of Europe have been</text>
  <text start="1137.299" dur="4.831">adopting bilateral trade relations for</text>
  <text start="1139.49" dur="5.34">some time rather than intimidating these</text>
  <text start="1142.13" dur="4.95">countries into can bitch elation a trade</text>
  <text start="1144.83" dur="4.53">war on the part of the u.s. is far more</text>
  <text start="1147.08" dur="5.189">likely to drive them more closely</text>
  <text start="1149.36" dur="4.02">together Germany and China and</text>
  <text start="1152.269" dur="4.38">particularly have been establishing</text>
  <text start="1153.38" dur="6.33">strong trade ties and OPEC nations have</text>
  <text start="1156.649" dur="6.03">been much cozier with the East yes we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1159.71" dur="5.089">been seeing this where countries because</text>
  <text start="1162.679" dur="4.71">of what has been going on they are</text>
  <text start="1164.799" dur="4.931">trading with each other getting out of</text>
  <text start="1167.389" dur="7.191">the dollar and you have to ask yourself</text>
  <text start="1169.73" dur="8.61">is this being done on purpose yes why</text>
  <text start="1174.58" dur="6.579">because it&amp;#39;s a move to destroy the</text>
  <text start="1178.34" dur="5.569">central banking currency I mean right</text>
  <text start="1181.159" dur="5.701">now the consumers and corporate buyers</text>
  <text start="1183.909" dur="5.831">we&amp;#39;re all sitting on historically high</text>
  <text start="1186.86" dur="5.039">debt levels in fact the debt levels</text>
  <text start="1189.74" dur="5.34">right now are higher than they were just</text>
  <text start="1191.899" dur="6.74">before the crash of 2008 this economy</text>
  <text start="1195.08" dur="5.88">can&amp;#39;t go anywhere it&amp;#39;s dead in the water</text>
  <text start="1198.639" dur="4.811">so as the Fed continues to raise</text>
  <text start="1200.96" dur="5.099">interest rates this debt will become</text>
  <text start="1203.45" dur="6.469">unsustainable and something we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="1206.059" dur="6.421">to give now again we have two narratives</text>
  <text start="1209.919" dur="4.211">happening at the same time we have the</text>
  <text start="1212.48" dur="3.87">central bank where they want to control</text>
  <text start="1214.13" dur="4.23">the narrative they want to say oh the</text>
  <text start="1216.35" dur="4.14">economy crash because of the tariffs</text>
  <text start="1218.36" dur="3.419">because of the tax cuts and whatnot we</text>
  <text start="1220.49" dur="3.51">know that Ben Bernanke is out there</text>
  <text start="1221.779" dur="4.38">saying that the tax cuts are dangerous</text>
  <text start="1224" dur="3.899">but everything else was fine going back</text>
  <text start="1226.159" dur="3.931">over the many years all the debt and</text>
  <text start="1227.899" dur="4.41">everything else but tack cut tax cuts</text>
  <text start="1230.09" dur="5.4">are the problems is a problem of today</text>
  <text start="1232.309" dur="6.301">but we could see right now that all of</text>
  <text start="1235.49" dur="7.71">this is being done because each side is</text>
  <text start="1238.61" dur="8.37">trying to control the narrative and the</text>
  <text start="1243.2" dur="5.939">longer the trade Wars continue the more</text>
  <text start="1246.98" dur="3.57">other countries will consider the</text>
  <text start="1249.139" dur="4.471">nuclear option</text>
  <text start="1250.55" dur="9.33">of dumping the dollar as the world</text>
  <text start="1253.61" dur="10.47">reserve or dumping the US debt when this</text>
  <text start="1259.88" dur="8.28">happens this will push the central bank</text>
  <text start="1264.08" dur="6.84">over the edge again who&amp;#39;s gonna control</text>
  <text start="1268.16" dur="5.22">the narrative at this point if it&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="1270.92" dur="5.34">right well it could be trumping the</text>
  <text start="1273.38" dur="6">Patriots where then they can ask for an</text>
  <text start="1276.26" dur="6.33">audit of the Fed of the central banking</text>
  <text start="1279.38" dur="5.9">system because he&amp;#39;s pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="1282.59" dur="4.98">that the economy&amp;#39;s doing fantastically</text>
  <text start="1285.28" dur="6.4">on the other hand the central bank is</text>
  <text start="1287.57" dur="6.27">raising rates unwinding and of course he</text>
  <text start="1291.68" dur="4.41">can turn this around and say the reason</text>
  <text start="1293.84" dur="3.9">why the economy fell apart is because</text>
  <text start="1296.09" dur="4.32">they were raising rates and they were</text>
  <text start="1297.74" dur="6.21">unwinding at the same time and then he</text>
  <text start="1300.41" dur="5.82">can show the history look at 2008 the</text>
  <text start="1303.95" dur="4.05">Fed was raising rates and unwinding</text>
  <text start="1306.23" dur="3.78">he&amp;#39;ll be able to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="1308" dur="4.14">just like the central bank control the</text>
  <text start="1310.01" dur="4.35">narrative back in the 70s when they</text>
