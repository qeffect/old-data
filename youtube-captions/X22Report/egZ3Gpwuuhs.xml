  <text start="63.909" dur="5.291">2018 and the top of the episode is world</text>
  <text start="67.1" dur="6.299">leaders are worried about the global</text>
  <text start="69.2" dur="6">economy the world is on fire let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="73.399" dur="4.04">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="75.2" dur="4.26">news now we&amp;#39;ve been talking about how</text>
  <text start="77.439" dur="4.871">countries around the world have been</text>
  <text start="79.46" dur="4.26">purchasing a lot of gold or repatriating</text>
  <text start="82.31" dur="1.979">their gold and we know that China and</text>
  <text start="83.72" dur="3.03">Russia</text>
  <text start="84.289" dur="4.681">they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing a lot of gold we</text>
  <text start="86.75" dur="4.74">also know that Germany Hungary Turkey</text>
  <text start="88.97" dur="4.259">and many other countries well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="91.49" dur="3.96">been repatriating their gold they wanted</text>
  <text start="93.229" dur="3.42">their gold back now there&amp;#39;s a reason for</text>
  <text start="95.45" dur="5.07">this because they understand and they</text>
  <text start="96.649" dur="6.541">realize that gold is basically an</text>
  <text start="100.52" dur="5.43">insurance policy it&amp;#39;s a confidence</text>
  <text start="103.19" dur="5.25">booster and it&amp;#39;s real money because they</text>
  <text start="105.95" dur="4.77">know once the paper money implodes</text>
  <text start="108.44" dur="4.319">they&amp;#39;re going to need something where</text>
  <text start="110.72" dur="4.319">the people can look at this and say ok</text>
  <text start="112.759" dur="3.75">we have confidence in the system the</text>
  <text start="115.039" dur="3.631">same thing with China and the same thing</text>
  <text start="116.509" dur="6.181">with Russia they know that the dollar</text>
  <text start="118.67" dur="5.849">system which will take out the euro and</text>
  <text start="122.69" dur="4.23">the other currency system all connected</text>
  <text start="124.519" dur="5.041">to the central banks once this implodes</text>
  <text start="126.92" dur="5.24">guess what you&amp;#39;re going to show and</text>
  <text start="129.56" dur="5.399">you&amp;#39;re going to need to show that we</text>
  <text start="132.16" dur="6.31">have a system that is backed by</text>
  <text start="134.959" dur="7.261">something that&amp;#39;s credible not just paper</text>
  <text start="138.47" dur="6.72">ink and air and this is why countries</text>
  <text start="142.22" dur="4.83">have been asking for their goal back</text>
  <text start="145.19" dur="3.689">this is why countries have been</text>
  <text start="147.05" dur="3.78">purchasing a lot of gold and of course</text>
  <text start="148.879" dur="4.051">at this time with gold being suppressed</text>
  <text start="150.83" dur="4.98">it is a great time to purchase as much</text>
  <text start="152.93" dur="8.76">gold as possible we know that Venezuela</text>
  <text start="155.81" dur="8.34">well they did a gold swap with Citigroup</text>
  <text start="161.69" dur="4.62">some years back once the sanction went</text>
  <text start="164.15" dur="4.29">when the sanctions were placed on them</text>
  <text start="166.31" dur="5.58">by the US this was during the Obama</text>
  <text start="168.44" dur="7.439">regime and now Venezuela is saying</text>
  <text start="171.89" dur="6.33">listen we want our gold back from the</text>
  <text start="175.879" dur="4.201">swamp we did with Citigroup and the</text>
  <text start="178.22" dur="3.33">Central Bank of Venezuela has paid a</text>
  <text start="180.08" dur="3.33">hundred and seventy two million dollars</text>
  <text start="181.55" dur="3.06">to the American makes Citigroup to</text>
  <text start="183.41" dur="3.72">recover the gold</text>
  <text start="184.61" dur="5.31">it had swamped with the bank now</text>
  <text start="187.13" dur="4.95">do they want their gold back well</text>
  <text start="189.92" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ve been selling their gold because</text>
  <text start="192.08" dur="3.78">under the sanctions that they&amp;#39;re under</text>
  <text start="194" dur="4.41">right now it has been very difficult and</text>
  <text start="195.86" dur="4.59">they needed to pay some bills so they</text>
  <text start="198.41" dur="4.17">need more gold back and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="200.45" dur="4.23">asking for their gold back and we can</text>
  <text start="202.58" dur="4.23">see that Venezuela gold reserves it has</text>
  <text start="204.68" dur="4.02">been dropping for for quite a while now</text>
  <text start="206.81" dur="5.67">since the sanctions have been placed on</text>
  <text start="208.7" dur="8.55">them and what is happening here is they</text>
  <text start="212.48" dur="7.17">realize that they need all their assets</text>
  <text start="217.25" dur="4.71">back in their country this is why other</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="4.77">countries are doing the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="221.96" dur="3.93">they realize once this system and this</text>
  <text start="224.42" dur="3.39">Venezuela is a very good model</text>
  <text start="225.89" dur="4.56">once the system implodes and paper is</text>
  <text start="227.81" dur="6.09">worth absolutely nothing which it is in</text>
  <text start="230.45" dur="5.82">Venezuela you need hard assets to make</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="6.21">ends meet it&amp;#39;s almost like your everyday</text>
  <text start="236.27" dur="6.18">household if you have paper in ink and</text>
  <text start="240.11" dur="5.58">you have a huge amount of debt and the</text>
  <text start="242.45" dur="6.21">paper in ink is worth nothing you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="245.69" dur="6.45">going to need hard assets to pay for</text>
  <text start="248.66" dur="5.73">that debt you can sell a car you can</text>
  <text start="252.14" dur="5.97">sell a home you can sell land you can</text>
  <text start="254.39" dur="8.13">have gold you can have silver but once</text>
  <text start="258.11" dur="5.87">again when the paper completely implodes</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="3.81">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this throughout history</text>
  <text start="263.98" dur="4.27">you&amp;#39;re going to need something in these</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="3.21">countries realize this and this is why</text>
  <text start="268.25" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;ve been asking for their gold back</text>
  <text start="269.54" dur="6.33">now in origin Tina we understand that</text>
  <text start="273.08" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re having major problems and the</text>
  <text start="275.87" dur="4.32">people in Argentina are very angry</text>
  <text start="277.61" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re blaming the problems on the IMF</text>
  <text start="280.19" dur="4.59">because the IMF is pushing austerity</text>
  <text start="281.9" dur="6.54">once again in Argentina and it looks</text>
  <text start="284.78" dur="7.92">like the IMF talks may push Argentina to</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="5.97">more central bank independence where</text>
  <text start="292.7" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re moving away from the central</text>
  <text start="294.41" dur="5.73">banking system because once again the</text>
  <text start="296.51" dur="6.81">people they&amp;#39;re angry about the situation</text>
  <text start="300.14" dur="5.19">and I think what&amp;#39;s happening here is</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="5.04">people around the world they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="305.33" dur="6.6">to wake up with what is going on here</text>
  <text start="308.36" dur="7.89">that most of these countries they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="311.93" dur="6.93">a huge amount of debt many people are</text>
  <text start="316.25" dur="5.11">out of work</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="5.309">austerity is being pushed on many</text>
  <text start="321.36" dur="6.29">individuals in different countries and</text>
  <text start="324.169" dur="6.37">the situation in all these countries is</text>
  <text start="327.65" dur="5.859">not that great now remember in the</text>
  <text start="330.539" dur="4.861">United States very difficult to realize</text>
  <text start="333.509" dur="5.81">what is going on because the United</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="6.989">States prints currency it is the reserve</text>
  <text start="339.319" dur="5.231">currency and they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="342.389" dur="4.741">manipulate it to make it look like</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="5.67">everything is great a country where they</text>
  <text start="347.13" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t print currency you can see exactly</text>
  <text start="350.22" dur="4.77">what is going on in that country because</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="6.57">they need to continually borrow and they</text>
  <text start="354.99" dur="7.35">have to beg for that currency and for</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="5.13">them to receive the currency they need</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="4.889">to push austerity on the people so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="364.56" dur="5.43">recognizable very easily in these</text>
  <text start="367.229" dur="4.47">country that there&amp;#39;s a problem in the</text>
  <text start="369.99" dur="5.31">United States a little it&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="371.699" dur="5.31">of a different story but we can see by</text>
  <text start="375.3" dur="3.54">looking at the data here in the United</text>
  <text start="377.009" dur="4.261">States that things are not that great</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="5.04">now they can manipulate the data as much</text>
  <text start="381.27" dur="4.079">as they possibly can they can give us</text>
  <text start="383.88" dur="3.3">the numbers they can tell us that</text>
  <text start="385.349" dur="4.41">everything is great but when you really</text>
  <text start="387.18" dur="4.14">look at it and you realize what is</text>
  <text start="389.759" dur="4.321">really going on you can see that this</text>
  <text start="391.32" dur="4.89">data makes no sense whatsoever and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="4.53">said this before in other reports as we</text>
  <text start="396.21" dur="7.679">move forward the data is going to</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="8.58">separate from reality now we know that</text>
  <text start="403.889" dur="4.911">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people unemployed we</text>
  <text start="407.19" dur="5.099">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that have</text>
  <text start="408.8" dur="5.83">fallen off where the government doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="412.289" dur="4.741">count them because they haven&amp;#39;t looked</text>
  <text start="414.63" dur="5.31">for a job in like 3-4 weeks so they just</text>
  <text start="417.03" dur="5.55">not counted and these people are</text>
  <text start="419.94" dur="4.71">considered people who really don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="422.58" dur="4.29">a job so there&amp;#39;s about a hundred and two</text>
  <text start="424.65" dur="3.63">million people that really just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="3.359">want to work they don&amp;#39;t want to provide</text>
  <text start="428.28" dur="5.46">for their family they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="430.229" dur="6.601">purchase things they don&amp;#39;t need it which</text>
  <text start="433.74" dur="5.459">is absolutely ridiculous but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="436.83" dur="5.25">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="439.199" dur="6.811">for the first time in history the number</text>
  <text start="442.08" dur="6.389">of job openings in the US has surpassed</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="4.74">the official number of unemployed</text>
  <text start="448.469" dur="5.821">workers</text>
  <text start="450.75" dur="6.03">so right now there are a lot more job</text>
  <text start="454.29" dur="5.94">openings than there are unemployed</text>
  <text start="456.78" dur="4.26">workers of course this is ridiculous but</text>
  <text start="460.23" dur="4.08">let&amp;#39;s go with it</text>
  <text start="461.04" dur="5.84">and yet something about the numbers they</text>
  <text start="464.31" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="466.88" dur="4.3">subsequent deep dives into the job</text>
  <text start="469.2" dur="5.76">number show us that the health of the</text>
  <text start="471.18" dur="6.78">job market may not be on par with where</text>
  <text start="474.96" dur="5.97">it was back in 2006 and that the job</text>
  <text start="477.96" dur="4.55">market health may be judging a book by</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s cover</text>
  <text start="482.51" dur="7.12">one such indicator to note is the amount</text>
  <text start="485.7" dur="6.06">of churn that occurs between jobs churn</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="4.83">is supposed to give an indication of how</text>
  <text start="491.76" dur="5.76">active participants in the workforce are</text>
  <text start="494.46" dur="5.52">in looking for better opportunities than</text>
  <text start="497.52" dur="5.16">the ones they currently have now think</text>
  <text start="499.98" dur="3.96">about this for a second that means that</text>
  <text start="502.68" dur="3.03">people who have jobs are gonna be</text>
  <text start="503.94" dur="3.3">looking for better jobs and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.71" dur="3.57">gonna get the better job with a higher</text>
  <text start="507.24" dur="5.01">salary remember there&amp;#39;s a lot of job</text>
  <text start="509.28" dur="7.91">openings out there so you would expect</text>
  <text start="512.25" dur="9.63">to see a high churn rate but guess what</text>
  <text start="517.19" dur="7.63">we don&amp;#39;t see that we don&amp;#39;t see any of</text>
  <text start="521.88" dur="4.76">that plus if there is all these job</text>
  <text start="524.82" dur="4.95">openings and there&amp;#39;s no one to fill them</text>
  <text start="526.64" dur="6.19">the employers would say hey we need</text>
  <text start="529.77" dur="5.99">people to fill these positions so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.83" dur="7.11">pay more money to get someone in here</text>
  <text start="535.76" dur="6.22">guess what you don&amp;#39;t see that either so</text>
  <text start="539.94" dur="5.01">something&amp;#39;s wrong something doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="541.98" dur="5.67">sense and anyone that has worked for a</text>
  <text start="544.95" dur="5.31">corporation who&amp;#39;ve worked in a position</text>
  <text start="547.65" dur="6.21">where you would hire people understand</text>
  <text start="550.26" dur="5.73">what might be happening well first we</text>
  <text start="553.86" dur="5.25">know that there are people looking for</text>
  <text start="555.99" dur="4.86">jobs we know that jobs well they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="559.11" dur="4.41">difficult to get because they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="560.85" dur="5.55">not out there secondly when you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="563.52" dur="5.46">position in a corporation and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="566.4" dur="5.55">trying to hire someone you normally have</text>
  <text start="568.98" dur="6.12">job wrecks and each department has their</text>
  <text start="571.95" dur="6.54">number of job wrecks that are filled now</text>
  <text start="575.1" dur="6.239">many times the hire management will say</text>
  <text start="578.49" dur="4.86">listen we&amp;#39;re not we&amp;#39;re in a hiring</text>
  <text start="581.339" dur="3.661">freeze right now but we still have job</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="4.289">wrecks we still want you the inter</text>
  <text start="585" dur="5.61">but we just can&amp;#39;t hire someone and I</text>
  <text start="587.639" dur="4.531">think this is part of the reason the</text>
  <text start="590.61" dur="3.419">companies they don&amp;#39;t want to hire anyone</text>
  <text start="592.17" dur="4.05">but the department&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t want to get</text>
  <text start="594.029" dur="5.161">rid of the job wrecks so what they do is</text>
  <text start="596.22" dur="6.239">they interview people but they never</text>
  <text start="599.19" dur="4.949">hire anyone this way you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="602.459" dur="3.541">move the salary up or down you have to</text>
  <text start="604.139" dur="4.38">do anything and it gives the illusion</text>
  <text start="606" dur="4.86">like there&amp;#39;s plenty of jobs out there</text>
  <text start="608.519" dur="4.051">because what do they do they just record</text>
  <text start="610.86" dur="4.589">the statistical number they put it out</text>
  <text start="612.57" dur="5.22">there and everyone believes it but once</text>
  <text start="615.449" dur="4.111">again we&amp;#39;re not seeing the signs that</text>
  <text start="617.79" dur="3.479">there are a lot of jobs out there</text>
  <text start="619.56" dur="4.35">because you would see people moving from</text>
  <text start="621.269" dur="5.641">one job to another and if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="623.91" dur="5.549">shortage of people you would see the</text>
  <text start="626.91" dur="3.78">salaries moving up but again we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="629.459" dur="4.351">see this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="630.69" dur="7.1">we also see us productivity well the</text>
  <text start="633.81" dur="7.29">growth is not increasing it is declining</text>
  <text start="637.79" dur="5.47">for the eighth straight quarter us</text>
  <text start="641.1" dur="4.95">productivity grew in the first quarter</text>
  <text start="643.26" dur="4.56">rising only 0.4 percent now they were</text>
  <text start="646.05" dur="4.56">expecting this to be a lot higher about</text>
  <text start="647.82" dur="5.67">0.6 percent and if you look over a</text>
  <text start="650.61" dur="6.39">period of time you can see productivity</text>
  <text start="653.49" dur="4.92">is declining right now and we also have</text>
  <text start="657" dur="5.819">to understand that wages are declining</text>
  <text start="658.41" dur="8.19">and we&amp;#39;re headed into a major major</text>
  <text start="662.819" dur="8.25">problem now the world leaders came</text>
  <text start="666.6" dur="7.89">together in a g7 meeting multi call it G</text>
  <text start="671.069" dur="6.871">six plus one and the plus one is the US</text>
  <text start="674.49" dur="5.01">and what&amp;#39;s happening here is with all</text>
  <text start="677.94" dur="3">the tariffs and everything that Trump is</text>
  <text start="679.5" dur="4.139">doing and the Patriots behind him</text>

  <text start="788.1" dur="6.349">they want to do the u.s. is going in a</text>
  <text start="791.759" dur="6">completely different direction because</text>
  <text start="794.449" dur="6.99">the motive here the the whole purpose of</text>

  <text start="815.459" dur="5.88">part of the other system and this is</text>
  <text start="819.149" dur="5.461">what I talk about when I say controlling</text>
  <text start="821.339" dur="4.68">the narrative back in the 70s yes the</text>
  <text start="824.61" dur="3.959">deep state the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="826.019" dur="3.54">control the narrative they were creating</text>
  <text start="828.569" dur="3.031">the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="829.559" dur="5.52">they were planning this for quite a</text>
  <text start="831.6" dur="4.669">while and they put that into place but</text>
  <text start="835.079" dur="3.81">they told us this whole entire</text>
  <text start="836.269" dur="4.3">ridiculous story about shortage of oil</text>
  <text start="838.889" dur="3.45">we can&amp;#39;t get supplies</text>
  <text start="840.569" dur="6.39">we had to come off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="842.339" dur="8.741">well today it&amp;#39;s the same thing the</text>
  <text start="846.959" dur="7.241">system is dying the system is done for</text>
  <text start="851.08" dur="4.8">and both sides are trying to control the</text>
  <text start="854.2" dur="3.44">narrative because when the system comes</text>
  <text start="855.88" dur="4.86">down whoever controls the narrative</text>
  <text start="857.64" dur="4.96">controls everything and the Biz the IMF</text>
  <text start="860.74" dur="4.59">and the rest they don&amp;#39;t want to give up</text>
  <text start="862.6" dur="4.14">their power and they&amp;#39;re gonna contrite</text>
  <text start="865.33" dur="5.22">ooh they&amp;#39;re gonna try to control the</text>
  <text start="866.74" dur="5.76">narrative at the same time the Patriots</text>
  <text start="870.55" dur="3.63">they want to control the narrative and</text>
  <text start="872.5" dur="3.21">they want to expose the central bank so</text>
  <text start="874.18" dur="3.54">we have a battle going on right now and</text>
  <text start="875.71" dur="4.89">we see it happening right in front of us</text>
  <text start="877.72" dur="5.4">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of things happening</text>
  <text start="880.6" dur="5.13">behind the scenes a little bit drips out</text>
  <text start="883.12" dur="4.77">every single day and we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="885.73" dur="4.74">this over time and I think we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="887.89" dur="5.43">to the point where the Patriots have a</text>
  <text start="890.47" dur="4.65">lot more control right now and I think a</text>

  <text start="926.59" dur="4.11">70s but you have to remember back then</text>
  <text start="928.93" dur="3.12">we were just coming off the gold</text>
  <text start="930.7" dur="5.04">standard we were the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="932.05" dur="7.08">and we were moving on to the petro</text>
  <text start="935.74" dur="6.24">dollar reserve system today we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="939.13" dur="5.55">be coming off the reserve currency which</text>
  <text start="941.98" dur="4.56">is the petro dollar system moving into</text>
  <text start="944.68" dur="4.59">something completely different which is</text>
