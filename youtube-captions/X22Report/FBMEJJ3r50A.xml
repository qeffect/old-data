  <text start="90.32" dur="6.7">bringing in forces to maintain control</text>
  <text start="93.689" dur="5.61">of the entire area central Africa</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="5.01">completely falling apart so what we are</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="5.401">seeing here is pretty much everything</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="6.51">coming and coming together now and</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="5.22">falling apart it is accelerating things</text>

  <text start="119.729" dur="4.35">up to twenty-six percent well they say</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="3.989">twenty to twenty five point nine percent</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="4.021">but let&amp;#39;s say twenty six percent here of</text>
  <text start="126.329" dur="3.721">course these are the government numbers</text>
  <text start="128.1" dur="3.96">and you know unemployment is probably</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="4.05">much much higher because you know they</text>
  <text start="132.06" dur="4.83">manipulated a little bit they tweaked it</text>
  <text start="134.1" dur="4.56">a little bit and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="3.66">probably a lot worse than it really is</text>
  <text start="138.66" dur="5.07">now back in 2013 on</text>
  <text start="140.55" dur="6.12">was around 25.7 and it increased the</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="5.48">25.9 and we are seeing this happen in</text>

  <text start="161.82" dur="4.98">rising it is not falling and they are</text>
  <text start="164.97" dur="3.99">expecting to uh they are expecting</text>
  <text start="166.8" dur="3.69">unemployment to continually rise in the</text>
  <text start="168.96" dur="2.79">foreseeable future right now because</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="3.78">they don&amp;#39;t see how they&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="171.75" dur="5.4">out of this situation they have a huge</text>
  <text start="174.27" dur="6.36">amount of debt more austerity on the way</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="7.14">people are suffering and this is not</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="5.19">going to end and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="184.29" dur="3.99">not the only country in Europe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="185.82" dur="4.05">going through this we see that Cyprus is</text>

  <text start="200.16" dur="5.01">spread into every single other country</text>
  <text start="202.83" dur="6.45">and of course here in the United States</text>
  <text start="205.17" dur="7.14">we have a complete illusion like</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="5.61">everything is fine as long as we keep</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="5.399">our eyes on the stock market we have no</text>
  <text start="214.89" dur="4.23">worries and today in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="5.611">they are out there that the US economy</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="6.75">is likely to rebound from the slow first</text>
  <text start="223.32" dur="5.07">quarter and they&amp;#39;re seeing good things</text>
  <text start="225.87" dur="4.92">happening later this year expect a</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="4.14">dreary report on Wednesday when the</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="4.5">government issues its first estimate of</text>
  <text start="232.53" dur="3.99">how fast the US economy grew in January</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="3.99">through March and of course that was the</text>
  <text start="236.52" dur="6.03">weather the weather made all the retail</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="6.51">stores closed down it made real estate</text>
  <text start="242.55" dur="5.04">implode on itself and people can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="3.87">work and company started to lay off</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="3.57">because it snowed in a couple places in</text>
  <text start="249.66" dur="4.5">the United States the rest of the United</text>
  <text start="251.16" dur="5.31">States was fine but these places made</text>
  <text start="254.16" dur="5.549">the entire economy completely implode on</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="5.579">itself really so this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="4.531">that 2014 will be the year the recovery</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="4.741">from the Great Recession finally</text>
  <text start="264.24" dur="6.12">achieves the robust growth that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.79" dur="5.67">needed to accelerate hiring really so</text>

  <text start="302.159" dur="3.54">talking oh I got laid off and I was</text>
  <text start="304.379" dur="3.961">making a hundred thousand now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="305.699" dur="4.291">getting $50,000 job you&amp;#39;re making half</text>
  <text start="308.34" dur="3.21">of what you were making before or if</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;re getting a part-time job you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.55" dur="4.5">not employed the same way you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.77" dur="4.29">employed at a lower level at this time</text>
  <text start="316.05" dur="4.829">so I don&amp;#39;t see where they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="318.06" dur="4.71">this from I don&amp;#39;t understand whether</text>
  <text start="320.879" dur="4.561">getting this and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="322.77" dur="4.35">getting it from thin air just like they</text>
  <text start="325.44" dur="3.569">do with the money they&amp;#39;re printing it</text>
  <text start="327.12" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re creating it out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="329.009" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re making up propaganda to make</text>
  <text start="331.77" dur="4.199">everyone believe that we are in some</text>
  <text start="334.139" dur="6.5">type of an economy now consumer</text>
  <text start="335.969" dur="7.44">confidence missed again it doubles most</text>
  <text start="340.639" dur="5.68">to a low of 15 months right now</text>
  <text start="343.409" dur="5.611">confidence dropped from a revised 83.9</text>
  <text start="346.319" dur="5.13">to an 80 2.3 as the present situation</text>
  <text start="349.02" dur="5.1">dropped its most in 15 months so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="351.449" dur="4.83">having problems here and people who are</text>
  <text start="354.12" dur="4.62">planning to buy a car or any type of</text>
  <text start="356.279" dur="4.651">major appliance it is dropped to a</text>
  <text start="358.74" dur="4.979">five-month low they are not planning to</text>
  <text start="360.93" dur="4.26">do anything at this time guess what</text>
  <text start="363.719" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re keeping their</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="4.379">money because they are scared they are</text>
  <text start="367.379" dur="4.26">afraid because they hear rumblings that</text>
  <text start="369.569" dur="4.891">there are more layoffs going on people</text>
  <text start="371.639" dur="4.68">are not secure in their jobs they are</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="3.78">nervous and those people who are laid</text>
  <text start="376.319" dur="3.66">off they don&amp;#39;t know if they can find a</text>
  <text start="378.24" dur="4.38">job and those people who have been</text>
  <text start="379.979" dur="4.68">looking still can&amp;#39;t find a job they</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="4.859">haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview with in the</text>
  <text start="384.659" dur="4.921">last four months or four weeks and now</text>
  <text start="387.479" dur="5.16">what that means is you&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="389.58" dur="5.57">counted in the unemployment figures so</text>
  <text start="392.639" dur="5.791">guess what this entire market is</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="5.049">crumbling around us it is not getting</text>
  <text start="398.43" dur="4.53">better like they&amp;#39;re telling us now</text>
  <text start="400.199" dur="6.69">case-shiller is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="402.96" dur="6.359">saying that the prices of homes</text>
  <text start="406.889" dur="4.71">their expectations a thirteen percent</text>
  <text start="409.319" dur="4.62">increase it came in at around twelve</text>
  <text start="411.599" dur="5.16">point eight six percent prices have now</text>
  <text start="413.939" dur="5.22">declined form four months in a row the</text>
  <text start="416.759" dur="5.52">longest negative stretch in actual home</text>
  <text start="419.159" dur="5.581">prices since march of 2012 the prices</text>
  <text start="422.279" dur="4.771">are starting to come down at this point</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="4.41">they cannot be sustained because what do</text>
  <text start="427.05" dur="5.16">we have we have investment companies</text>
  <text start="429.15" dur="5.099">hedge funds pumping up this market the</text>
  <text start="432.21" dur="4.739">American people are tapped out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.249" dur="5.151">not going out to get mortgages they the</text>
  <text start="436.949" dur="5.34">mortgage originations are in decline</text>
  <text start="439.4" dur="4.359">people do not have the down payment the</text>
  <text start="442.289" dur="2.85">mortgage companies understand this</text>
  <text start="443.759" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;ve lowered it from</text>
  <text start="445.139" dur="4.351">twenty five or twenty percent down to</text>
  <text start="446.909" dur="4.711">three from five to three percent some</text>
  <text start="449.49" dur="5.1">places even zero because they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="451.62" dur="6.06">to get anyone that has a pulse in to</text>
  <text start="454.59" dur="5.729">purchase a home please please buy this</text>
  <text start="457.68" dur="4.079">because we need to unload the homes from</text>
  <text start="460.319" dur="3.68">these investment companies they do not</text>
  <text start="461.759" dur="4.981">want to hold on to these houses any</text>
  <text start="463.999" dur="4.361">longer and what&amp;#39;s worse even</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="4.53">case-shiller itself appears to have</text>
  <text start="468.36" dur="5.1">given up on a housing as the driver of</text>
  <text start="471.27" dur="4.56">wealth effect five years into the</text>
  <text start="473.46" dur="4.41">recovery from the recession the economy</text>
  <text start="475.83" dur="4.199">will need to look to gains in consumer</text>
  <text start="477.87" dur="3.93">spending but guess what those gains and</text>
  <text start="480.029" dur="4.051">consumer spending they&amp;#39;re not there</text>
  <text start="481.8" dur="3.959">people do not have the money so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="484.08" dur="3.6">not seeing it in housing we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="485.759" dur="5.041">seeing it in consumer spending because</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="6.06">people are tapped out they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="490.8" dur="5.579">work and right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="493.74" dur="5.849">13 cities decline for the for the month</text>
  <text start="496.379" dur="4.891">of februari in prices and this is going</text>
  <text start="499.589" dur="5.521">to start to spread all across the</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="5.91">country more and more home more more</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="4.829">cities are going to report in that</text>
  <text start="507.18" dur="5.31">housing prices are declining because</text>
  <text start="509.939" dur="7.04">there are no American people to pick up</text>
  <text start="512.49" dur="6.959">the slack this was pumped up the housing</text>
  <text start="516.979" dur="5.86">shortage that they could they occur they</text>
  <text start="519.449" dur="5.491">are continually claiming is artificial</text>
  <text start="522.839" dur="4.351">they&amp;#39;ve been keeping houses off the</text>

  <text start="527.19" dur="3.69">the banks are not taking them they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="529.35" dur="3.12">letting the people live there even</text>
  <text start="530.88" dur="4.17">though they&amp;#39;re not making payments it</text>
  <text start="532.47" dur="5.04">makes no difference right now the</text>
  <text start="535.05" dur="4.71">housing market is done and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="537.51" dur="2.97">trying to pump it up for the very last</text>
  <text start="539.76" dur="2.61">time</text>
  <text start="540.48" dur="2.94">before it completely implodes and this</text>
  <text start="542.37" dur="2.94">is why they&amp;#39;re starting with the</text>
  <text start="543.42" dur="3.659">subprime this is why they&amp;#39;re lowering</text>
  <text start="545.31" dur="3.029">the down payment this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.079" dur="2.94">going back to the adjustable rate</text>
  <text start="548.339" dur="5.161">mortgage they&amp;#39;re trying to do everything</text>
  <text start="550.019" dur="9.63">and anything to pump this market up the</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="8.639">best they can now I have to say the</text>
  <text start="559.649" dur="6.3">American home ownership dream is pretty</text>
  <text start="562.139" dur="6.541">much officially dead at this point q1</text>
  <text start="565.949" dur="4.741">home ownership rate was about sixty four</text>
  <text start="568.68" dur="4.68">point eight percent this is the lowest</text>
  <text start="570.69" dur="4.199">in nineteen years now we have to look at</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="4.56">the five-year growth and personal</text>
  <text start="574.889" dur="6.901">incoming income and what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="577.92" dur="7.74">if we go back to 2000 personal income</text>
  <text start="581.79" dur="6.539">growth was around about seventeen</text>
  <text start="585.66" dur="4.77">percent or so since that time it has</text>
  <text start="588.329" dur="4.981">been declining and ever since we hit</text>
  <text start="590.43" dur="6.11">that 2008 where it was around fifteen</text>
  <text start="593.31" dur="7.41">percent it is declined since that time</text>
  <text start="596.54" dur="7.33">2009 it declined to about 5% we saw it</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="7.29">even decline even further in 2012 to</text>
  <text start="603.87" dur="7.92">about 0% now here in 2014 we are</text>
  <text start="608.01" dur="6.93">negative five percent right now so it is</text>
  <text start="611.79" dur="5.669">not getting better things are definitely</text>
  <text start="614.94" dur="4.709">getting worse and if we look at all the</text>
  <text start="617.459" dur="3.661">jobs that are going on we have many many</text>
  <text start="619.649" dur="3.661">layoffs since the beginning of this year</text>

  <text start="1285.309" dur="5.161">understand that the government would</text>
  <text start="1286.99" dur="5.13">love to control the internet and we see</text>
  <text start="1290.47" dur="4.199">President Obama has already handed off</text>
  <text start="1292.12" dur="4.83">the internet to the UN and we can see</text>
  <text start="1294.669" dur="5.281">they&amp;#39;re taking other precautions to try</text>
  <text start="1296.95" dur="6.03">to control the internet by letting the</text>
  <text start="1299.95" dur="5.46">ISP providers make fast medium slow</text>

  <text start="1305.41" dur="5.009">their websites that be seen just pay a</text>
  <text start="1307.72" dur="5.28">huge amount of money and we will let</text>

  <text start="1317.08" dur="3.51">we won&amp;#39;t care about them but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1318.94" dur="3.3">looking at right now state officials in</text>
  <text start="1320.59" dur="3.87">Michigan and Pennsylvania have been</text>
  <text start="1322.24" dur="5.1">awarded roughly about 2.4 million in</text>

  <text start="1327.34" dur="5.07">system that&amp;#39;s been called a driver&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1329.71" dur="4.5">license for the Internet so pretty much</text>
  <text start="1332.41" dur="5.13">what they want to do is they want to</text>
  <text start="1334.21" dur="5.88">give every single person an ID so you</text>
  <text start="1337.54" dur="3.509">can have access to the Internet and what</text>
  <text start="1340.09" dur="2.76">that ID</text>
  <text start="1341.049" dur="3.36">will contain will be all your</text>
  <text start="1342.85" dur="5.25">information maybe they&amp;#39;ll plug this into</text>
  <text start="1344.409" dur="5.22">the Real ID system that the DHS is</text>
  <text start="1348.1" dur="4.74">having all states come in compliance</text>
  <text start="1349.629" dur="4.38">with maybe they will do that where all</text>
  <text start="1352.84" dur="4.35">your information is in a federal</text>
  <text start="1354.009" dur="5.221">database you get online your ID is</text>
  <text start="1357.19" dur="3.9">scanned at once and then you have access</text>
  <text start="1359.23" dur="4.319">to pretty much everything now of course</text>
  <text start="1361.09" dur="4.709">they can they can track you they can</text>
  <text start="1363.549" dur="4.98">censor you they have full control over</text>
  <text start="1365.799" dur="4.771">who you are on the internet and they can</text>
  <text start="1368.529" dur="3.99">do whatever they want and again you have</text>
  <text start="1370.57" dur="4.739">to remember this is also very dangerous</text>
  <text start="1372.519" dur="4.38">because now you have one ID for pretty</text>
  <text start="1375.309" dur="4.23">much everything if somebody actually</text>
  <text start="1376.899" dur="5.28">steals that one ID they have access to</text>
  <text start="1379.539" dur="4.83">the kingdom right now for me I have</text>
  <text start="1382.179" dur="4.2">different passwords and usernames for</text>
  <text start="1384.369" dur="3.721">different areas that I go on the</text>
  <text start="1386.379" dur="4.081">internet with so just in case something</text>
  <text start="1388.09" dur="5.61">happens they can&amp;#39;t get into the rest of</text>
  <text start="1390.46" dur="6.539">my stuff this new ID system is one ID</text>
  <text start="1393.7" dur="5.039">it&amp;#39;s a single ID type of system and it</text>
  <text start="1396.999" dur="3.27">will allow them to have access to pretty</text>
  <text start="1398.739" dur="3.75">much everything if they get ahold of it</text>
  <text start="1400.269" dur="6.15">plus the government will have the</text>
  <text start="1402.489" dur="7.89">ability to track every single person and</text>
  <text start="1406.419" dur="5.671">this I feel is a huge problem because it</text>
  <text start="1410.379" dur="4.05">makes it easier for the government to</text>
  <text start="1412.09" dur="4.529">censor you it makes it easier for them</text>

  <text start="1416.619" dur="4.29">what they want they want to know what</text>

  <text start="1427.69" dur="4.38">google hasn&amp;#39;t been handing it over this</text>
  <text start="1430.149" dur="3.541">will make it a lot easier they will not</text>
  <text start="1432.07" dur="3.719">need any of the search engines to do</text>
  <text start="1433.69" dur="5.4">this anymore they will just have it all</text>
  <text start="1435.789" dur="7.59">the time they will track every single</text>
  <text start="1439.09" dur="7.289">thing that you do now the Senate is out</text>
