  <text start="58.68" dur="4.909">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="60.57" dur="5.49">that when Greece didn&amp;#39;t accept more debt</text>
  <text start="63.589" dur="3.971">Fitch and the other rating agencies came</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="4.89">out and said okay we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="6.63">basically bring down their rating they</text>
  <text start="70.95" dur="7.04">dropped it by a notch and now we see</text>
  <text start="74.19" dur="6.959">that since they&amp;#39;re taking on more debt</text>

  <text start="135.48" dur="5.46">we go back to two thousand eight it</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="6.9">doesn&amp;#39;t work this country should be</text>
  <text start="140.94" dur="5.609">downgraded to collapse soon collapse</text>
  <text start="143.85" dur="5.87">rating that&amp;#39;s where it should be right</text>
  <text start="146.549" dur="5.31">now but of course the central bankers</text>
  <text start="149.72" dur="3.85">they&amp;#39;re in control of the rating</text>
  <text start="151.859" dur="4.771">agencies they don&amp;#39;t want people to know</text>
  <text start="153.57" dur="6.3">what&amp;#39;s really going on until it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="156.63" dur="4.56">late we see out in the eurozone as they</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="3.21">continually tell us that everything is</text>
  <text start="161.19" dur="2.43">fine even though we continually look and</text>
  <text start="163.08" dur="3.629">show</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="7.47">that yeah it isn&amp;#39;t fine we see the</text>
  <text start="166.709" dur="7.95">eurozone construction output is down by</text>
  <text start="171.09" dur="6.78">negative one point nine percent I mean</text>
  <text start="174.659" dur="7.981">we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more negative news</text>
  <text start="177.87" dur="7.47">come out of Europe out of the United</text>
  <text start="182.64" dur="4.319">States but the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="185.34" dur="3.479">corporate media they continually spin it</text>
  <text start="186.959" dur="4.051">to make it seem like everything is fine</text>
  <text start="188.819" dur="6.271">oh it&amp;#39;s a little slump but things look</text>
  <text start="191.01" dur="6">better oh it&amp;#39;s sunny out but as we move</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="3.959">into the fall things are going to really</text>
  <text start="197.01" dur="3.75">pick up because all of a sudden we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.049" dur="4.491">gonna have manufacturing production</text>
  <text start="200.76" dur="5">people are just gonna get jobs and</text>
  <text start="203.54" dur="4.69">everything&amp;#39;s just going to be okay I</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="6.039">mean does it make any sense to anyone no</text>
  <text start="208.23" dur="6.66">it doesn&amp;#39;t I mean think about this the</text>
  <text start="211.799" dur="7.08">number of self-employed Americans is at</text>
  <text start="214.89" dur="6.599">an all-time low right now it is not</text>
  <text start="218.879" dur="3.72">coincidence that this record was set at</text>
  <text start="221.489" dur="2.571">the same time that the number of</text>
  <text start="222.599" dur="5.48">Americans receiving government</text>
  <text start="224.06" dur="6.85">entitlements is at an all-time high</text>
  <text start="228.079" dur="5.711">basically there&amp;#39;s a cultural shift which</text>
  <text start="230.91" dur="5.189">is occurring in this country and it is</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="4.05">resulting in more business closing than</text>
  <text start="236.099" dur="6.381">being opened and we talked about this</text>
  <text start="237.84" dur="8.22">before but of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="5.589">the financial media out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="4.319">spinning all of this they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="248.069" dur="4.441">make you believe that no entrepreneurs</text>
  <text start="250.379" dur="4.44">in the United States it&amp;#39;s growing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.51" dur="5.159">the best ever I mean look at all these</text>
  <text start="254.819" dur="5.64">startup companies for social media that</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="6.301">makes no money that are valued very very</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="5.43">high but these are all business gimmicks</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="4.5">these aren&amp;#39;t real businesses we saw this</text>
  <text start="265.889" dur="4.801">back in the dot-com error the same</text>
  <text start="268.47" dur="4.949">things happening right now here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="270.69" dur="6.24">little-known fact seventy-five percent</text>
  <text start="273.419" dur="6.541">of all venture back firms firms that</text>
  <text start="276.93" dur="7.5">raise at least 1 million don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="7.92">return investors capital which means the</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="5.94">money has gone forever what America</text>
  <text start="287.88" dur="4.8">needs right now is for people to start</text>
  <text start="290.37" dur="4.26">their own business not mobile apps</text>
  <text start="292.68" dur="3.57">social media websites and all these</text>
  <text start="294.63" dur="2.52">ridiculous things that really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="296.25" dur="3.96">produce any</text>
  <text start="297.15" dur="5.43">thing we need people to get back to the</text>
  <text start="300.21" dur="4.11">basics we need to start manufacturing we</text>
  <text start="302.58" dur="5.61">need them to start opening real</text>
  <text start="304.32" dur="6.06">businesses that produce but we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="308.19" dur="3.6">seeing that right now and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="310.38" dur="4.26">that there are less and less</text>
  <text start="311.79" dur="6.69">entrepreneurs less and less businesses</text>
  <text start="314.64" dur="7.62">that are opening and this is not helping</text>
  <text start="318.48" dur="7.68">the economy whatsoever I mean right now</text>
  <text start="322.26" dur="5.22">over the last five years Obama is out</text>
  <text start="326.16" dur="3.09">there and he said it you know we</text>
  <text start="327.48" dur="4.23">mentioned this before has created 11</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="5.25">million new jobs our economy is growing</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="8.7">and creating jobs at the fastest pace</text>
  <text start="334.5" dur="7.65">since 1999 well the headline job numbers</text>
  <text start="340.41" dur="4.53">suggests that Obama is right and that</text>
  <text start="342.15" dur="5.82">the job situation is improving the</text>
  <text start="344.94" dur="6.87">average American is far far from solid</text>
  <text start="347.97" dur="6.96">financial footing today yes they might</text>
  <text start="351.81" dur="7.98">have a part-time job it&amp;#39;s not the same</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="6.96">pay rate it&amp;#39;s not the same job summon</text>
  <text start="359.79" dur="4.56">going from a corporate job making eighty</text>
  <text start="361.89" dur="5.19">ninety a hundred thousand going to a</text>
  <text start="364.35" dur="4.98">part-time or lesser job is not the same</text>
  <text start="367.08" dur="5.55">and you have to remember how they</text>
  <text start="369.33" dur="5.67">calculate this if you&amp;#39;re making 80,000</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="4.38">90,000 you want from one job and now you</text>
  <text start="375" dur="6.17">have two part-time jobs you have two</text>
  <text start="377.01" dur="9.81">jobs that&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s counted job growth</text>
  <text start="381.17" dur="7.42">but no wage growth job seekers may find</text>
  <text start="386.82" dur="4.29">it easier to find a job but good luck</text>
  <text start="388.59" dur="5.31">trying to find a job that pays enough to</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="4.8">support a family good luck trying to</text>
  <text start="393.9" dur="5.73">find that same job that you had before</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="7.02">at the same pay or higher pay people are</text>
  <text start="399.63" dur="5.22">finding it very difficult to find that</text>
  <text start="402.93" dur="5.67">job I mean look at the college graduates</text>
  <text start="404.85" dur="8.25">who graduate with their degree who</text>
  <text start="408.6" dur="6.39">cannot find work in their field this is</text>
  <text start="413.1" dur="4.35">why everyone&amp;#39;s modifying their student</text>
  <text start="414.99" dur="3.87">loans this is why people can&amp;#39;t pay for</text>
  <text start="417.45" dur="5.31">the students this is why they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="418.86" dur="7.59">living with their parents so if we dig</text>
  <text start="422.76" dur="6.39">below the headlines we and we look</text>
  <text start="426.45" dur="4.5">closer what do we see well government</text>
  <text start="429.15" dur="5.85">worker wages not private</text>
  <text start="430.95" dur="6.66">vector is showing how wages are</text>
  <text start="435" dur="5.94">increasing the overall ECI the</text>
  <text start="437.61" dur="5.49">employment Cost Index was up by 0.2% but</text>
  <text start="440.94" dur="4.65">that is only because compensation for</text>
  <text start="443.1" dur="9.6">government workers increased by</text>
  <text start="445.59" dur="10.92">point-six percent private sector zero so</text>
  <text start="452.7" dur="6">the government is basically keeping the</text>
  <text start="456.51" dur="5.7">illusion alive that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="458.7" dur="6.33">right now benefits not wages are rising</text>
  <text start="462.21" dur="4.56">in the past 12 months the employment</text>
  <text start="465.03" dur="3.12">Cost Index is up two percent just like</text>
  <text start="466.77" dur="4.62">we said remember there are two</text>
  <text start="468.15" dur="6.48">components of labor costs wages benefits</text>
  <text start="471.39" dur="6.24">like paid vacation social security</text>
  <text start="474.63" dur="8.16">workers compensation and of course</text>
  <text start="477.63" dur="8.4">health insurance wages are roughly</text>
  <text start="482.79" dur="8.4">seventy percent of ECI and benefits make</text>
  <text start="486.03" dur="7.23">up the remaining thirty percent so what</text>
  <text start="491.19" dur="4.2">are we saying over the last 12 months</text>
  <text start="493.26" dur="5.31">the cost of bed and benefits has</text>
  <text start="495.39" dur="7.86">increased by one point seven percent why</text>
  <text start="498.57" dur="10.05">ah that&amp;#39;s right higher health insurance</text>
  <text start="503.25" dur="9.78">costs the trend these days is for</text>
  <text start="508.62" dur="6.75">employers to pass some or all of the</text>
  <text start="513.03" dur="5.46">higher cost of health insurance to</text>
  <text start="515.37" dur="7.89">employees and basically what happens is</text>
  <text start="518.49" dur="7.56">it reduces that take-home pay so what</text>
  <text start="523.26" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this illusion</text>
  <text start="526.05" dur="3.53">created by the government to make</text>
  <text start="527.67" dur="4.23">everyone think that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="529.58" dur="5.44">yes we&amp;#39;re seeing a moderate wage</text>
  <text start="531.9" dur="6.83">increase yes for government workers but</text>
  <text start="535.02" dur="8.31">the private sector is not seeing it I</text>
  <text start="538.73" dur="6.76">mean we see right now that this makes</text>
  <text start="543.33" dur="5.28">sense because people are not going out</text>
  <text start="545.49" dur="5.9">spending their money we see retail</text>
  <text start="548.61" dur="4.89">contracting the rate of homeownership</text>
  <text start="551.39" dur="8.94">hasn&amp;#39;t been this low since nineteen</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="9.81">sixty seven people don&amp;#39;t have the money</text>
  <text start="560.33" dur="4.3">there&amp;#39;s a huge problem</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="5.51">and it&amp;#39;s not going to get any better</text>
  <text start="564.63" dur="8.39">anytime soon this will continually</text>
  <text start="568.82" dur="7.42">happen as time goes on because basically</text>
  <text start="573.02" dur="5.05">we&amp;#39;re in a collapsed situation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="576.24" dur="5.58">doing whatever they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="578.07" dur="8.37">this thing together and we understand</text>
  <text start="581.82" dur="6.15">right now fifty percent of people in</text>
  <text start="586.44" dur="6.3">America now get some kind of government</text>
  <text start="587.97" dur="8.19">check every month Social Security</text>
  <text start="592.74" dur="6">Medicare or running dry people are</text>
  <text start="596.16" dur="5.82">getting other entitlement payments sent</text>
  <text start="598.74" dur="5.67">out monthly which keeps the population</text>
  <text start="601.98" dur="5.46">clothed fed housed so right now the</text>
  <text start="604.41" dur="6.54">government is flipping the bill for</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="6.99">fifty percent of the country think about</text>
  <text start="610.95" dur="5.579">this for a second what happens when this</text>
  <text start="614.43" dur="4.05">stops and they can no longer pay because</text>
  <text start="616.529" dur="6.481">how they&amp;#39;re doing it right now is</text>
  <text start="618.48" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re continually borrowing and this</text>
  <text start="623.01" dur="4.17">is why we see the debt continually</text>
  <text start="624.66" dur="6.48">increasing how long do you think this</text>
  <text start="627.18" dur="5.43">can happen I know we have the magical</text>
  <text start="631.14" dur="5.01">button that creates the money from the</text>
  <text start="632.61" dur="6.27">Fed but sooner or later things come to a</text>
  <text start="636.15" dur="5.76">screeching halt everyone in in their</text>
  <text start="638.88" dur="4.68">personal finances has most everyone has</text>
  <text start="641.91" dur="3.72">a magical button called the credit card</text>
  <text start="643.56" dur="5.85">how long can you continually keep this</text>
  <text start="645.63" dur="6.18">going look what happened to Greece they</text>
  <text start="649.41" dur="5.58">have a very hard time making payments</text>
  <text start="651.81" dur="8.34">and eventually they won&amp;#39;t be able to do</text>
  <text start="654.99" dur="9.3">it this entire system will implode and</text>
  <text start="660.15" dur="5.97">payments will stop when this stops fifty</text>
  <text start="664.29" dur="3.48">percent of the country who&amp;#39;s using this</text>
  <text start="666.12" dur="4.26">money to buy food clothing and</text>
  <text start="667.77" dur="7.68">everything else comes to a screeching</text>
  <text start="670.38" dur="8.49">halt this cannot go on forever and it</text>
  <text start="675.45" dur="7.71">won&amp;#39;t I know people think it will but it</text>
  <text start="678.87" dur="9.36">absolutely will not history has proven</text>
  <text start="683.16" dur="8.34">this over and over again now the Fed is</text>
  <text start="688.23" dur="6.93">out there and they have just admitted</text>
  <text start="691.5" dur="5.639">that after six years of QE four point</text>
  <text start="695.16" dur="5.489">five trillion on their balance sheet</text>
  <text start="697.139" dur="7.26">they&amp;#39;re saying QA q e was a complete and</text>
  <text start="700.649" dur="5.61">utter mistake it did not work it did not</text>
  <text start="704.399" dur="3.99">spur economic growth it did not help the</text>
  <text start="706.259" dur="3.961">person on the street it did absolutely</text>
  <text start="708.389" dur="4.29">nothing except blow up these bubbles</text>

  <text start="723.72" dur="5.94">is in a perfect recovery the Fed</text>
  <text start="727.459" dur="5.79">basically if you want to believe it</text>
  <text start="729.66" dur="6.299">leaked there minutes and they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="733.249" dur="5.351">GDP growth it&amp;#39;s a little bit weaker than</text>
  <text start="735.959" dur="5.75">they thought but the projected GDP</text>
  <text start="738.6" dur="7.949">growth seems to be pretty darn good as</text>
  <text start="741.709" dur="7.63">recoveries go consumer spending the</text>
  <text start="746.549" dur="5.31">incoming data has been uneven but</text>
  <text start="749.339" dur="4.29">participants cited reports that contact</text>
  <text start="751.859" dur="4.95">suggesting a pickup since the first</text>
