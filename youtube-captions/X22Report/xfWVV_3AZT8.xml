  <text start="232.829" dur="8.03">sure that they stick to their deal</text>

  <text start="244.109" dur="4.44">the UK is going to prosper remember</text>
  <text start="246.359" dur="3.181">right after the referendum they said</text>

  <text start="265.32" dur="6.18">going to start to catch on that is their</text>
  <text start="268.56" dur="5.19">biggest fear remember the deep state the</text>
  <text start="271.5" dur="6.06">central bank&amp;#39;s what they normally do is</text>
  <text start="273.75" dur="6.99">they push fear to convince everyone in</text>
  <text start="277.56" dur="4.8">doing it their way and if you don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="280.74" dur="3.33">it their way well then they come up with</text>
  <text start="282.36" dur="4.77">events and other things to force you</text>
  <text start="284.07" dur="4.59">into doing it their way but what this</text>
  <text start="287.13" dur="3.539">shows us is something very very</text>
  <text start="288.66" dur="4.02">important and we see it&amp;#39;s spreading</text>
  <text start="290.669" dur="3.781">around the world this was just the</text>
  <text start="292.68" dur="3.61">beginning this referendum to go up</text>
  <text start="294.45" dur="5.14">against the central banks</text>

  <text start="299.59" dur="6.21">people around the world they&amp;#39;re waking</text>
  <text start="301.6" dur="6.3">up this is the the biggest nightmare the</text>
  <text start="305.8" dur="6.66">central bank&amp;#39;s the deep state could ever</text>
  <text start="307.9" dur="7.02">imagine the people waking up now here in</text>

  <text start="328.48" dur="3.99">for a very long time you already knew</text>
  <text start="330.04" dur="4.05">this but think of the thousands hundreds</text>
  <text start="332.47" dur="5.79">of thousands millions of people that</text>
  <text start="334.09" dur="5.85">never knew about this and the reason why</text>
  <text start="338.26" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re doing this is because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.94" dur="6.66">preparing a transition preparing to</text>
  <text start="343.03" dur="5.91">reset the entire system and to point the</text>

  <text start="434.93" dur="5.519">effect on the everyday person yes there</text>
  <text start="438.53" dur="3.63">are certain agencies within the</text>
  <text start="440.449" dur="4.701">government that are going to be affected</text>
  <text start="442.16" dur="5.94">because they didn&amp;#39;t get paid but overall</text>
  <text start="445.15" dur="6.34">no one really felt any difference if the</text>
  <text start="448.1" dur="4.89">government was open or closed except for</text>
  <text start="451.49" dur="3.989">the mainstream media out there making it</text>

  <text start="484.76" dur="4.02">bring down the economy during the</text>

  <text start="553.009" dur="5.161">annual drop in five years and you can</text>
  <text start="555.5" dur="4.079">see the trajectory that homes have been</text>
  <text start="558.17" dur="5.01">declining yes when you raise interest</text>
  <text start="559.579" dur="5.61">rates when houses balloon out of control</text>
  <text start="563.18" dur="4.29">where you can&amp;#39;t afford them and wages</text>

  <text start="798.35" dur="4.14">tweeted out something very very</text>
  <text start="800.3" dur="4.32">interesting and we went over many of</text>
  <text start="802.49" dur="5.94">trumps post and he does believe in gold</text>

  <text start="808.43" dur="3.99">once said you know whoever control</text>
  <text start="810.12" dur="5.51">the gold controls pretty much everything</text>

  <text start="830.01" dur="4.74">even close</text>
  <text start="831.08" dur="7.39">so right now Trump is telling us</text>
  <text start="834.75" dur="7.32">something that the economy is headed</text>
  <text start="838.47" dur="6.39">towards a gold standard what is Q told</text>

  <text start="884.04" dur="5.07">there&amp;#39;s not going to be any type of</text>
  <text start="885.66" dur="7.17">action later on remember to move a bill</text>
  <text start="889.11" dur="7.349">like this you need something to happen</text>
  <text start="892.83" dur="7.5">where it calls attention to what is</text>
  <text start="896.459" dur="7.411">happening so if the economy comes down</text>
  <text start="900.33" dur="6.12">and Trump was blaming it on the Fed he</text>
  <text start="903.87" dur="4.26">could say the Fed was responsible for</text>
  <text start="906.45" dur="2.91">bringing down the economy because they</text>
  <text start="908.13" dur="4.05">raised the rates which I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="909.36" dur="5.34">going to do after the election and then</text>
  <text start="912.18" dur="5.52">Trump could say why were they raising</text>
  <text start="914.7" dur="4.95">the rent the the rates while the economy</text>
  <text start="917.7" dur="4.53">was doing so well it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="919.65" dur="4.35">maybe we should find out what else the</text>
  <text start="922.23" dur="4.17">Fed has been doing because it seems like</text>
  <text start="924" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re working in the opposite</text>
  <text start="926.4" dur="6.09">direction of what we&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="929.01" dur="6.48">here oh wait here&amp;#39;s audit the Fed and</text>
  <text start="932.49" dur="4.83">that&amp;#39;s how it begins that&amp;#39;s all that</text>

  <text start="937.32" dur="3.6">American people together and the economy</text>
  <text start="938.91" dur="4.919">crashes and Trump is pointing the finger</text>
