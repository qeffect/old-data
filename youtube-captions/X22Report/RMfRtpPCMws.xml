  <text start="127.28" dur="4.66">globally right now in the year of 2016</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="5.58">this year they&amp;#39;re going to be laying off</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="7.23">about 14,000 people Germany is laying</text>

  <text start="144.84" dur="5.52">and they have a code name for this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147" dur="5.37">called Project solitaire and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="150.36" dur="4.349">seeing is that these companies are being</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="7.07">very very quiet about this remember the</text>
  <text start="154.709" dur="8.911">u.s. that the the department that counts</text>
  <text start="159.44" dur="5.16">layoffs back in 2013 was discontinued</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="3.14">because of budget</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="3.54">so we look at challenger gray &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="166.76" dur="4.71">christmas to give us the information</text>
  <text start="168.14" dur="5.49">about all these companies laying off ed</text>
  <text start="171.47" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that things are</text>
  <text start="173.63" dur="4.86">starting to ramp up at this point in</text>
  <text start="174.98" dur="6.69">time we see BNSF is going to lay off</text>
  <text start="178.49" dur="4.74">about 4,600 people nationwide and this</text>
  <text start="181.67" dur="5.34">is really spreading because as we go</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="5.85">back to June of 2014 to this point in</text>
  <text start="187.01" dur="3.93">time in 2016 we&amp;#39;re seeing almost a</text>
  <text start="189.08" dur="5.49">million people that have been laid off</text>
  <text start="190.94" dur="5.19">and this is continually happening there</text>
  <text start="194.57" dur="4.26">are a lot of small companies that are</text>
  <text start="196.13" dur="4.8">laying off and there are larger</text>
  <text start="198.83" dur="4.26">companies that are laying off there are</text>
  <text start="200.93" dur="4.65">retail stores that are laying off and</text>
  <text start="203.09" dur="6.3">this is going to continually happen and</text>
  <text start="205.58" dur="5.37">once the market completely crashes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="209.39" dur="3.84">going to see companies come out of</text>
  <text start="210.95" dur="4.98">nowhere and say okay we need to cut our</text>
  <text start="213.23" dur="4.68">staff in half and this is definitely</text>
  <text start="215.93" dur="4.74">what we&amp;#39;re going to see now when we look</text>
  <text start="217.91" dur="7.29">at the labor market we see that the</text>
  <text start="220.67" dur="7.86">conditions right now they are about what</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="6.57">we saw back in 2009 the labor market</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="8.16">conditions index continues to push to</text>
  <text start="231.77" dur="7.92">its weakest since 2009 the nineteen</text>
  <text start="236.69" dur="7.38">factor labor market condition shows us</text>
  <text start="239.69" dur="6.84">that everything is not awesome and we</text>
  <text start="244.07" dur="5.01">know that the US the central bank they</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="5.28">have manipulated lating these numbers</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="4.59">for quite a while they don&amp;#39;t count those</text>
  <text start="251.81" dur="5.1">people that aren&amp;#39;t looking anymore but</text>
  <text start="253.67" dur="5.16">still want a job and they just count</text>
  <text start="256.91" dur="3.18">them as falling off and even if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.83" dur="2.73">setting out a resume and you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="260.09" dur="2.91">been on an interview guess what hey</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="3.21">you&amp;#39;re out of luck we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="263" dur="3.72">count you if you&amp;#39;re working a part-time</text>
  <text start="264.77" dur="3.66">job guess what we&amp;#39;re just not going to</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="4.29">count you but if you get a part-time job</text>
  <text start="268.43" dur="4.65">we count we count you as a full-time job</text>
  <text start="271.01" dur="3.12">so we can see how they play around with</text>
  <text start="273.08" dur="3.69">all these different numbers and</text>
  <text start="274.13" dur="6.51">everything like that and the economy at</text>
  <text start="276.77" dur="6.93">this point is declining we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="280.64" dur="6.9">to see everything where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.7" dur="5.67">downgrading and revising their numbers</text>
  <text start="287.54" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re going back and saying okay yeah</text>
  <text start="289.37" dur="3.78">look it looks pretty bad right now and</text>
  <text start="291.98" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;re going to have to downgrade our</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="4.47">numbers now we see the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="295.19" dur="3.09">it has moved up a little bit to about</text>
  <text start="297.62" dur="4.769">400</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="6.18">87 this is still very very low compared</text>
  <text start="302.389" dur="5.101">to all the other years going back to</text>
  <text start="304.46" dur="5.63">1985 and we can see at this point during</text>
  <text start="307.49" dur="4.74">a healthy economy we&amp;#39;re around 1100 and</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="4.06">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a little</text>
  <text start="312.23" dur="3.6">bump up and most likely we&amp;#39;ll probably</text>
  <text start="314.15" dur="4.62">level off and then start heading down</text>
  <text start="315.83" dur="6.36">again and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before many</text>
  <text start="318.77" dur="7.619">many times during this portion of the</text>
  <text start="322.19" dur="6.15">year and as we move forward we can see</text>
  <text start="326.389" dur="3.931">that manufacturing is going to</text>
  <text start="328.34" dur="4.53">continually decline we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="330.32" dur="4.2">the US service sector is going to</text>
  <text start="332.87" dur="4.62">decline and right now the US service</text>
  <text start="334.52" dur="6.39">sector it is barely hanging on by a</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="6.24">thread new business expanded at the</text>
  <text start="340.91" dur="7.2">slowest pace since the survey began in</text>
  <text start="343.73" dur="9.08">October of 2009 so this is telling us</text>
  <text start="348.11" dur="6.84">that things again are falling apart now</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="4.45">we&amp;#39;re going to walk down memory lane</text>
  <text start="354.95" dur="5.76">here and talk about all the things that</text>
  <text start="357.26" dur="5.34">are going on in the economy and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.71" dur="5.519">going to take a look at it and see if</text>
  <text start="362.6" dur="5.97">any of these things have improved now us</text>
  <text start="366.229" dur="6.961">factory orders they have declined</text>
  <text start="368.57" dur="7.92">year-on-year for 16 months in a row this</text>
  <text start="373.19" dur="5.31">sound like a recovery no actually</text>
  <text start="376.49" dur="4.97">factory orders right now have reached</text>
  <text start="378.5" dur="7.35">the lowest level since the summer of</text>
  <text start="381.46" dur="7.03">2011 it is being projected right now</text>
  <text start="385.85" dur="5.04">that corporate earnings is down</text>
  <text start="388.49" dur="6.06">eight-point-five percent and this is</text>
  <text start="390.89" dur="5.31">during the first quarter of 2016 this</text>
  <text start="394.55" dur="5.429">will be the fourth quarter in a row that</text>
  <text start="396.2" dur="6.48">we see year-over-year declines total</text>

  <text start="430.37" dur="3.57">up thirty two percent</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="5.09">during the force the first quarter of</text>

  <text start="463.07" dur="7.62">down construction spending is down we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="468.53" dur="5.22">starting to see this picture that the</text>
  <text start="470.69" dur="5.04">economy at this point is doing what we</text>
  <text start="473.75" dur="3.63">did back in two thousand eight or a lot</text>

  <text start="499.13" dur="4.2">we see a contraction in real estate this</text>
  <text start="501.56" dur="4.5">is why we see a contraction in retail</text>
  <text start="503.33" dur="5.97">this is why we see a contraction in GDP</text>
  <text start="506.06" dur="5.4">this is why we see a contraction in the</text>
  <text start="509.3" dur="3.87">economy of the United States and not</text>
  <text start="511.46" dur="4.83">just the United States but Canada</text>

  <text start="570.23" dur="4.55">know everyone&amp;#39;s talking about this for a</text>
  <text start="572.03" dur="5.73">very long time you know what I remember</text>
  <text start="574.78" dur="5.17">think of a bridge when the inspector</text>
  <text start="577.76" dur="4.74">comes out and says yeah I see the rust</text>
  <text start="579.95" dur="4.02">we better we better file a report here</text>
  <text start="582.5" dur="4.2">because it&amp;#39;s starting to rust and they</text>
  <text start="583.97" dur="4.29">the building department gets the report</text>
  <text start="586.7" dur="3">and there&amp;#39;s a big cover-up they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="588.26" dur="3.09">want to spend the money they say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="589.7" dur="3.33">not a big deal it&amp;#39;s a little bit of rust</text>
  <text start="591.35" dur="4.32">they come out at once again the next</text>
  <text start="593.03" dur="5.88">year they look at the bridge they say I</text>
  <text start="595.67" dur="5.64">yes there&amp;#39;s more us now this might be</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="5.1">becoming unsafe at this point let&amp;#39;s file</text>
  <text start="601.31" dur="4.56">another report of course because of</text>
  <text start="604.01" dur="3.12">corruption and everything else they</text>
  <text start="605.87" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t want to do anything to the bridge</text>
  <text start="607.13" dur="3.96">they come out once again they inspect it</text>
  <text start="609.38" dur="3.57">people get paid off don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="611.09" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s not a problem but the rest is</text>
  <text start="612.95" dur="5.85">spreading now and it&amp;#39;s becoming critical</text>
  <text start="615.47" dur="6.42">you know 34 years pass and they say yeah</text>
  <text start="618.8" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t worry about it and then all of a</text>
  <text start="621.89" dur="6.72">sudden in the sixth year what happens</text>

  <text start="630.02" dur="6.39">it it&amp;#39;s never going to happen the bridge</text>
  <text start="632.09" dur="6.18">is fine everyone&amp;#39;s been using it it all</text>
  <text start="636.41" dur="3.33">of a sudden one day collapses then all</text>
