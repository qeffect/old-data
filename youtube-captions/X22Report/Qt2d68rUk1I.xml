  <text start="72.979" dur="4.14">news now it looks like the IMF is</text>
  <text start="75.619" dur="3.571">getting a little worried about Greece</text>
  <text start="77.119" dur="3.511">because as we know their debt cannot be</text>
  <text start="79.19" dur="3.539">sustained they already written a report</text>
  <text start="80.63" dur="4.29">saying that it cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="82.729" dur="4.2">whatsoever and the Executive Board of</text>
  <text start="84.92" dur="4.14">the International Monetary Fund while</text>
  <text start="86.929" dur="5.371">they reached an agreement on the</text>
  <text start="89.06" dur="6.9">provision of a 1.6 billion euro which is</text>
  <text start="92.3" dur="5.7">a 1.8 billion dollar conditional loan to</text>
  <text start="95.96" dur="3.75">Greece now the arrangement which</text>

  <text start="99.71" dur="4.469">economic adjustment programs has been</text>
  <text start="102.289" dur="3.481">approved in principle which means it</text>
  <text start="104.179" dur="4.8">will become effective only after the</text>
  <text start="105.77" dur="6.03">funds received and of course Greece has</text>
  <text start="108.979" dur="5.691">to meet specific and credible assurances</text>
  <text start="111.8" dur="6.029">that they&amp;#39;re going to reduce their debt</text>
  <text start="114.67" dur="4.96">make it sustainable and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="117.829" dur="4.621">have to work through some of the</text>
  <text start="119.63" dur="4.98">economic programs which means more</text>
  <text start="122.45" dur="5.22">austerity selling off more of their</text>
  <text start="124.61" dur="5.55">assets and basically doing whatever the</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="6.03">bankers want now it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="130.16" dur="5.549">saying here&amp;#39;s some funds because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="133.7" dur="5.099">very worried that if we don&amp;#39;t give you</text>
  <text start="135.709" dur="5.521">more debt you will collapse and if you</text>
  <text start="138.799" dur="4.261">collapse under our watch everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.23" dur="3.72">going to point to us saying wait a</text>
  <text start="143.06" dur="4.47">minute you told us everything was fine</text>
  <text start="144.95" dur="4.71">you tell you told us by giving them more</text>
  <text start="147.53" dur="6.42">and more debt their economy is going to</text>
  <text start="149.66" dur="7.41">improve and if you notice the central</text>
  <text start="153.95" dur="7.319">bankers they will always give you more</text>
  <text start="157.07" dur="6.57">debt because if they don&amp;#39;t well the</text>
  <text start="161.269" dur="5.31">whole thing just implodes they need to</text>
  <text start="163.64" dur="6.93">keep this going and they need to rob the</text>
  <text start="166.579" dur="6.451">country of all its real physical assets</text>
  <text start="170.57" dur="5.85">and this is what we are seeing this is</text>
  <text start="173.03" dur="6.179">what&amp;#39;s in store for every single country</text>
  <text start="176.42" dur="5.76">who has a private was a central bank</text>
  <text start="179.209" dur="6.271">which loans money with interest attached</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="4.77">which does not care about the economic</text>
  <text start="185.48" dur="3.63">condition of the</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="5.819">country all they care about is receiving</text>
  <text start="189.11" dur="6.09">profit from their debt now here in the</text>
  <text start="192.769" dur="5.281">United States we see that things well</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="5.97">they are not improving whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="198.05" dur="6.17">especially for GM they have been whacked</text>
  <text start="201.17" dur="6.149">really hard now remember all throughout</text>
  <text start="204.22" dur="5.71">this last what eight years or so they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="207.319" dur="5.061">been telling us how great car sales are</text>
  <text start="209.93" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s incredible everything&amp;#39;s fantastic</text>
  <text start="212.38" dur="3.609">sales are going through the roof em</text>
  <text start="214.43" dur="3.839">again we broke it down</text>
  <text start="215.989" dur="6.03">they channel stuff the dealership lots</text>
  <text start="218.269" dur="5.611">those counted as sales and we knew that</text>
  <text start="222.019" dur="4.861">this was completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="223.88" dur="5.4">now what has happened here is that US</text>
  <text start="226.88" dur="5.389">car sales they&amp;#39;ve plunged by nineteen</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="5.7">percent and in June thirty eight percent</text>
  <text start="232.269" dur="6.011">now the rest of the industry is down</text>
  <text start="234.98" dur="7.2">around ten percent or so now GM is</text>
  <text start="238.28" dur="9.06">losing ground in the entire industry</text>
  <text start="242.18" dur="8.94">wide car sales arena and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="6.54">seeing right now is that the cars are</text>
  <text start="251.12" dur="4.769">stuffed into the lot the Lots have about</text>
  <text start="253.88" dur="4.8">a hundred eighty days worth of supplies</text>
  <text start="255.889" dur="5.88">so GM is cuttin production they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.68" dur="5.33">laying off their closing plants and they</text>
  <text start="261.769" dur="5.671">are looking to discontinue certain</text>
  <text start="264.01" dur="6.34">vehicles the Chevy Volt the Buick</text>
  <text start="267.44" dur="3.57">LaCrosse the Cadillac CTS the Cadillac</text>
  <text start="270.35" dur="4.14">XTS</text>
  <text start="271.01" dur="6.9">the Chevrolet Impala the Chevrolet Sonic</text>
  <text start="274.49" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re looking to basically get rid of</text>
  <text start="277.91" dur="3.54">these automobiles because it is just not</text>
  <text start="280.46" dur="4.14">worth it right now</text>
  <text start="281.45" dur="6.39">and we see they&amp;#39;re in a big amount of</text>
  <text start="284.6" dur="5.64">trouble and it&amp;#39;s not going to end well</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="4.86">for any of these corporations and we</text>
  <text start="290.24" dur="7.28">need to remember that these corporations</text>
  <text start="292.7" dur="8.79">well their pension plans they are very</text>
  <text start="297.52" dur="7.54">underfunded and we have a list here of</text>
  <text start="301.49" dur="6.12">the most underfunded corporate pensions</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="8.25">now when we look at this we have to</text>
  <text start="307.61" dur="7.22">remember that these pension plans as of</text>
  <text start="313.31" dur="4.26">the end of 2016</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="5.14">ninety percent of the top 200 corporate</text>
  <text start="317.57" dur="2.69">pensions in the ESPE were underfunded to</text>
  <text start="319.97" dur="2.06">the</text>
  <text start="320.26" dur="4.83">tune of about three hundred and eighty</text>
  <text start="322.03" dur="6.18">two billion dollars Delta Airlines</text>
  <text start="325.09" dur="4.86">forty nine point four percent American</text>
  <text start="328.21" dur="4.31">Airlines fifty eight percent</text>
  <text start="329.95" dur="6.69">Procter and Gamble fifty nine percent</text>

  <text start="336.64" dur="6.09">energy 65 percent DuPont 67 percent</text>
  <text start="339.82" dur="5.31">General Electric sixty-seven percent and</text>
  <text start="342.73" dur="4.92">when you look at this you can see a lot</text>
  <text start="345.13" dur="5.55">of these corporations their pension</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="5.16">plans are underfunded and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="350.68" dur="4.35">to be in a lot of trouble as we move</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="5.76">forward this individual</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="7.71">Larry Burrell who is retired and work</text>
  <text start="358.57" dur="6.84">for the Ohio Iron Workers well his</text>
  <text start="362.74" dur="6.72">monthly take-home pension was cut by</text>
  <text start="365.41" dur="7.05">more than a half from 3700 to 1600 can</text>
  <text start="369.46" dur="5.67">you imagine the country who where</text>
  <text start="372.46" dur="4.56">everyone&amp;#39;s receiving a pension of thirty</text>
  <text start="375.13" dur="4.08">seven hundred fifty four hundred twenty</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="5.94">three hundred or whatever the amount is</text>
  <text start="379.21" dur="6.72">and it is cut in half what do you do to</text>
  <text start="382.96" dur="6.3">survive or maybe the corporation goes</text>
  <text start="385.93" dur="6.06">under and there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing for</text>
  <text start="389.26" dur="5.34">you well this is what&amp;#39;s being played out</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="6.87">right now and if we think about if we go</text>
  <text start="394.6" dur="6.54">back to 2007 going into 2008-2009 where</text>
  <text start="398.86" dur="4.17">a lot of individuals where they thought</text>
  <text start="401.14" dur="4.53">they had these pensions who work for</text>
  <text start="403.03" dur="5.22">like GM and many other areas all of a</text>
  <text start="405.67" dur="4.95">sudden their their pension plans you</text>
  <text start="408.25" dur="4.35">know drop dramatically and many people</text>
  <text start="410.62" dur="4.23">were very worried many people lost a lot</text>
  <text start="412.6" dur="3.9">of their money especially you know when</text>
  <text start="414.85" dur="4.41">they lost their jobs they also lost</text>
  <text start="416.5" dur="5.22">their investments their homes this time</text>
  <text start="419.26" dur="4.56">around as we can see since this economy</text>
  <text start="421.72" dur="4.65">has been built on one gigantic illusion</text>
  <text start="423.82" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s not going to be any better it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.37" dur="4.83">going to be that much worse and we can</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="3.78">see the central bank&amp;#39;s what do they be</text>
  <text start="431.2" dur="4.23">doing they&amp;#39;ve been propping up the stock</text>
  <text start="433.21" dur="4.29">market making everyone think that the</text>
  <text start="435.43" dur="3.57">economy is doing well thinking that all</text>
  <text start="437.5" dur="3.69">these corporations are doing very well</text>
  <text start="439" dur="3.84">but most of these corporations they</text>
  <text start="441.19" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t have the sales they&amp;#39;re doing these</text>
  <text start="442.84" dur="3.66">tricky accounting methods to make</text>
  <text start="445.06" dur="3">everyone think that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="446.5" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re buying back their stocks and</text>
  <text start="448.06" dur="4.93">when all is said and done we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="450.22" dur="5.59">come to find out that most of this has</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="4.68">a lie now they keep talking that oh</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s a lot of cash on the sidelines</text>
  <text start="457.67" dur="2.91">we&amp;#39;re just waiting for all this cash on</text>
  <text start="459.35" dur="2.94">the sidelines to be invested in the</text>
  <text start="460.58" dur="5.1">market and everything is going to be</text>
  <text start="462.29" dur="5.54">fine well there is no cash on the</text>
  <text start="465.68" dur="4.14">sidelines there is nothing out there</text>
  <text start="467.83" dur="5.44">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="469.82" dur="6.45">is that private client cash high net</text>
  <text start="473.27" dur="5.01">worth individuals or those who still</text>
  <text start="476.27" dur="4.44">allocate capital to single stocks and</text>
  <text start="478.28" dur="6.84">ETFs on the discretionary basis well</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="6.63">guess what it is at a record low it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.12" dur="6.87">around ten point four percent and if we</text>
  <text start="487.34" dur="8.52">go back to 2011 back then it was at 12</text>
  <text start="491.99" dur="6.72">percent right before the crash back in</text>
  <text start="495.86" dur="4.77">oh seven it was at eleven percent</text>
  <text start="498.71" dur="4.8">it peaked in oh nine at twenty-one</text>
  <text start="500.63" dur="6.45">percent and dropped all the way down to</text>
  <text start="503.51" dur="8.52">twelve percent in 2011 here we are in</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="6.63">2017 it&amp;#39;s at 10.4% who&amp;#39;s propping up the</text>
  <text start="512.03" dur="4.5">market we know who it is</text>
  <text start="513.71" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s countries and central banks who are</text>
  <text start="516.53" dur="3.9">purchasing stocks they have their own</text>
  <text start="518.42" dur="3.45">trading desks we know that this is</text>
  <text start="520.43" dur="4.2">completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="521.87" dur="6.81">now we&amp;#39;re getting another indicator that</text>
  <text start="524.63" dur="5.31">we are entering this recession period</text>
  <text start="528.68" dur="4.68">now I believe we&amp;#39;ve been in recession</text>
  <text start="529.94" dur="6.72">since 2016 the mid-2016 part of the year</text>
  <text start="533.36" dur="6.03">and again government&amp;#39;s the Fed they</text>
  <text start="536.66" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t admit to a recession they will go</text>
  <text start="539.39" dur="3.39">back in time once the recession hits</text>
  <text start="541.31" dur="3.27">once were in the recession in the</text>
  <text start="542.78" dur="3.63">collapse they&amp;#39;ll go back in time and say</text>
  <text start="544.58" dur="4.86">oh yeah by the way it started in mid</text>
  <text start="546.41" dur="5.64">2016 but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="549.44" dur="5.31">that the growth in the supply of US</text>
  <text start="552.05" dur="5.25">dollars fell again in May this time to a</text>
  <text start="554.75" dur="6.12">hundred and five month low of five point</text>
  <text start="557.3" dur="6.06">four percent the last time the money</text>
  <text start="560.87" dur="5.82">supply grew and a smaller rate was</text>
  <text start="563.36" dur="6.45">during September 2008 at a rate of 5.2</text>
  <text start="566.69" dur="5.94">percent the money supply metric used is</text>
  <text start="569.81" dur="5.58">an Austrian money supply measure it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="572.63" dur="4.74">metric developed by Murray Rothbard and</text>
  <text start="575.39" dur="5.67">Joseph Salerno and is designed to</text>
  <text start="577.37" dur="5.15">provide a better measure than the m2 the</text>
  <text start="581.06" dur="4.44">Austrian measure of the money supply</text>
  <text start="582.52" dur="4.24">differs from the m2 and that includes</text>
  <text start="585.5" dur="4.529">Treasury deposit</text>
  <text start="586.76" dur="5.61">Treasury deposits at the Fed and exclude</text>
  <text start="590.029" dur="4.591">short time short time deposits</text>
  <text start="592.37" dur="4.92">traveler&amp;#39;s checks and retail money funds</text>
  <text start="594.62" dur="5.899">m2 growth also slow to made falling to</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="7.56">5.6 percent which is a 20 month low now</text>
  <text start="600.519" dur="6.221">money supply growth is a helpful measure</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="5.099">of economic activity</text>
  <text start="606.74" dur="5.969">now during periods of an economic boom</text>
  <text start="609.949" dur="5.911">money supply tends to grow very quickly</text>
  <text start="612.709" dur="5.221">as banks make more loans now during</text>
  <text start="615.86" dur="5.729">recessions or when the economy turns</text>
  <text start="617.93" dur="6.39">downward guess what happens well we see</text>
  <text start="621.589" dur="5.43">a declining a falling money supply and</text>
  <text start="624.32" dur="6.509">this is what we are seeing right now and</text>
  <text start="627.019" dur="5.88">of course thanks to central bank&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="630.829" dur="4.01">supply growth in recent decades has</text>
  <text start="632.899" dur="4.5">never gone into negative territory</text>
  <text start="634.839" dur="5.74">because they are able to keep it where</text>
  <text start="637.399" dur="6.18">it is but it still shows us as it</text>
  <text start="640.579" dur="6.351">continually drops and Falls that we are</text>
  <text start="643.579" dur="7.801">entering a recession now loan growth</text>
  <text start="646.93" dur="8.26">also has not been this week since April</text>
  <text start="651.38" dur="5.819">of 2011 now we&amp;#39;re finding these similar</text>
  <text start="655.19" dur="3.6">trends and real estate loans and in</text>
  <text start="657.199" dur="4.051">consumer loans so when you put all this</text>
  <text start="658.79" dur="5.34">together this indicator is letting us</text>
  <text start="661.25" dur="5.639">know that we&amp;#39;re already in a recession</text>
  <text start="664.13" dur="4.62">or we&amp;#39;re entering a recession because</text>
  <text start="666.889" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="668.75" dur="5.73">say since we&amp;#39;ve seen the money supply</text>
  <text start="671.149" dur="7.411">dropped like it has which is equivalent</text>
  <text start="674.48" dur="6.99">back to 2011 prior to 2011 20 2009 2010</text>
  <text start="678.56" dur="6.63">this is showing us that we are already</text>
  <text start="681.47" dur="5.52">in a recession and we are headed to this</text>
  <text start="685.19" dur="3.509">major collapse so when we start looking</text>
  <text start="686.99" dur="2.73">at all these economic indicators and</text>
  <text start="688.699" dur="3.39">we&amp;#39;re started putting all them together</text>
  <text start="689.72" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a very clear</text>
  <text start="692.089" dur="5.43">picture that we&amp;#39;re already in the middle</text>

  <text start="736.839" dur="5.161">they walk back their comments and they</text>
