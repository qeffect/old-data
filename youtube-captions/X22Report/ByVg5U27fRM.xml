  <text start="57.99" dur="7.74">episode 1466 am today&amp;#39;s date is January</text>
  <text start="62.61" dur="4.95">8th 2018 and the top of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.73" dur="5.43">the economy is in the process of being</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="5.4">reworked for the transition let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.16" dur="4.26">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.96" dur="6.21">news now we are headed into a point in</text>
  <text start="75.42" dur="6.57">time where it is going to get a lot</text>
  <text start="79.17" dur="4.71">worse now I know a lot of people think</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="3.66">that the economy is doing great and I</text>
  <text start="83.88" dur="4.11">think the majority of the people in</text>
  <text start="85.65" dur="5.219">America right now and maybe globally</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="5.58">they do think the economy of the world</text>
  <text start="90.869" dur="5.221">is doing a lot better especially here in</text>
  <text start="93.57" dur="5.76">the United States people do believe this</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="7.169">they feel like everything is ok and this</text>
  <text start="99.33" dur="6.84">is a very scary moment when people do</text>
  <text start="103.259" dur="5.25">believe that things are ok like this</text>
  <text start="106.17" dur="4.68">because this is when the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="108.509" dur="6.681">this is when they pull the carpet out</text>
  <text start="110.85" dur="8.4">from under everything and think about</text>
  <text start="115.19" dur="6.55">2006 2007 I mean go back on YouTube and</text>
  <text start="119.25" dur="4.679">listen to these individuals on the</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="4.439">corporate media and people taking a</text>
  <text start="123.929" dur="4.05">equity line of credit and they were</text>
  <text start="126.179" dur="4.731">spending money like there was no</text>
  <text start="127.979" dur="5.671">tomorrow and I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="130.91" dur="5.799">money in real estate remember this is</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="6.99">paper money this is it doesn&amp;#39;t exist yet</text>
  <text start="136.709" dur="6.331">until you sell your home or you take an</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="4.77">equity line of credit out on your house</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="4.919">but you didn&amp;#39;t make anything there you</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="5.04">just borrowed against what you&amp;#39;ve earned</text>
  <text start="147.959" dur="4.461">now if your house price goes down why</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="4.29">you&amp;#39;ll have this equity line of credit</text>
  <text start="152.42" dur="4.33">there&amp;#39;s major problems this is what</text>
  <text start="154.74" dur="5.46">happened in 2008 a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="156.75" dur="6.99">done that also and what the central bank</text>
  <text start="160.2" dur="6.03">wants is they want people to take out</text>
  <text start="163.74" dur="3.66">these additional loans on their real</text>
  <text start="166.23" dur="3.15">estate remember what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;ve pumped the real estate market up</text>
  <text start="169.38" dur="3.9">in 20 different cities they&amp;#39;ve did</text>
  <text start="172.11" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;ve done as much as they possibly</text>
  <text start="173.28" dur="4.53">can there&amp;#39;s no more that they can do at</text>
  <text start="175.56" dur="3.509">this point this is why your see articles</text>
  <text start="177.81" dur="2.789">coming out saying there&amp;#39;s trillions</text>
  <text start="179.069" dur="4.741">locked up in real estate because they</text>
  <text start="180.599" dur="5.741">want those people to take equity lines</text>
  <text start="183.81" dur="5.289">of credit out on their homes and they</text>
  <text start="186.34" dur="5.1">they want you to spend it in retail what</text>
  <text start="189.099" dur="4.801">do they get out of this well they get</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="5.1">everyone&amp;#39;s spending in retail hopefully</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="7.65">to boost GDP because 70 percent of GDP</text>
  <text start="196.54" dur="7.65">is retail they also get more debt think</text>
  <text start="201.55" dur="3.96">about this for a second and this is why</text>
  <text start="204.19" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re coming up with those type of</text>
  <text start="205.51" dur="4.5">articles but if you&amp;#39;re smart and this is</text>
  <text start="208.15" dur="3.809">my personal opinion you wouldn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="210.01" dur="6.539">wouldn&amp;#39;t do that I wouldn&amp;#39;t go out and</text>
  <text start="211.959" dur="7.321">take a loan out on your paper earnings</text>
  <text start="216.549" dur="6.3">that really don&amp;#39;t exist yet because you</text>
  <text start="219.28" dur="7.739">didn&amp;#39;t sell your house now we are seeing</text>
  <text start="222.849" dur="6.42">that a lot of retailers they&amp;#39;re closing</text>
  <text start="227.019" dur="4.86">down shop corporations or laying off</text>
  <text start="229.269" dur="4.821">people go pro they were laying off about</text>
  <text start="231.879" dur="4.741">250 people of course they&amp;#39;re saying they</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="4.33">reworking their entire business they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236.62" dur="4.619">going to be restructuring a lot of</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="5.459">companies say this and they use this</text>
  <text start="241.239" dur="4.681">excuse to explain away why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.879" dur="3.301">letting all these people go I mean if</text>
  <text start="245.92" dur="3.39">you really remember remember Circuit</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="3.899">City well they were restructuring also</text>
  <text start="249.31" dur="4.89">they don&amp;#39;t exist anymore</text>
  <text start="251.079" dur="5.15">we know that Regis this is Regis Corp</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="5.759">and they have these smart style salons</text>
  <text start="256.229" dur="5.861">inside Walmart they&amp;#39;re closing about 600</text>
  <text start="259.959" dur="5.761">of these because they&amp;#39;re underperforming</text>
  <text start="262.09" dur="6.06">and they&amp;#39;re restructuring now once again</text>
  <text start="265.72" dur="5.009">this means there&amp;#39;s not a lot of people</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="5.01">going to these places that&amp;#39;s 600 of them</text>
  <text start="270.729" dur="4.711">that are closing now what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="273.16" dur="5.009">happening here is that people are</text>
  <text start="275.44" dur="5.67">feeling good now we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="278.169" dur="4.951">the economy and we know that things are</text>
  <text start="281.11" dur="4.32">going south in the economy we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="283.12" dur="3.75">looking at the indicators we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="4.08">looking at what&amp;#39;s really been going on</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="4.68">and a lot of this what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="5.25">right now duplicates what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="5.46">seeing back prior to 2008 and prior to</text>
  <text start="294.76" dur="4.909">pretty much every recession we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="297.01" dur="5.61">especially 2008 we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="299.669" dur="6.131">now what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="302.62" dur="6.6">a lot of people won out and they charged</text>
  <text start="305.8" dur="6.39">their retail purchases this holiday</text>
  <text start="309.22" dur="6.05">season a lot more than they&amp;#39;ve ever done</text>
  <text start="312.19" dur="5.43">before and we have confirmation of this</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="4.29">where we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="5.94">and this is coming from the Fed data</text>
  <text start="319.56" dur="7.51">total consumer debt rose by 28 billion</text>
  <text start="323.56" dur="5.18">or the most since November first to</text>
  <text start="327.07" dur="4.2">three point eight to seven trillion and</text>
  <text start="328.74" dur="5.53">annualized increase of eight point eight</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="6.27">percent or roughly four times faster</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="6.15">than the pace of GDP growth you break</text>
  <text start="337.54" dur="4.98">this down consumer credit rose by eleven</text>
  <text start="340.42" dur="4.34">point two billion in revolving credit or</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="4.86">credit card debt which pushed it a</text>
  <text start="344.76" dur="4.29">record one point zero to three trillion</text>
  <text start="347.38" dur="5.04">the highest credit card amount</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="5.38">outstanding on record this was also the</text>
  <text start="352.42" dur="4.38">second highest monthly increase in</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="5.85">credit card debt on record now when we</text>
  <text start="356.8" dur="7.5">look at this we can see that the debt</text>
  <text start="360.28" dur="7.89">level has reached the point of where we</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="9.63">were right before everything fell apart</text>
  <text start="368.17" dur="9.44">in 2008 people back then felt incredible</text>
  <text start="373.93" dur="7.14">they felt like the economy could never</text>
  <text start="377.61" dur="6.79">implode that real estate would never</text>
  <text start="381.07" dur="7.7">implode that everything would be fine</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="7.83">and what happened everything fell apart</text>
  <text start="388.77" dur="5.98">we seen on revolving credit that&amp;#39;s auto</text>
  <text start="392.23" dur="3.84">student loans that rose by sixteen point</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="4.2">eight trillion to two point eight zero</text>
  <text start="396.07" dur="6.27">five trillion and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="398.95" dur="6.47">right now is that student loans has rose</text>
  <text start="402.34" dur="6.66">to one point one four two trillion</text>
  <text start="405.42" dur="6.16">personal savings right now has dropped</text>
  <text start="409" dur="6.15">by two point nine percent this is the</text>
  <text start="411.58" dur="6.42">lowest since November of 2007 it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="415.15" dur="5.58">same thing happening once again people</text>
  <text start="418" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t have savings right they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="420.73" dur="3.99">their savings so they&amp;#39;re using credit</text>
  <text start="422.86" dur="3.06">cards they feel everything is going to</text>
  <text start="424.72" dur="2.91">be great because they&amp;#39;ve been told it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.92" dur="3.35">going to be great and they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="427.63" dur="4.28">their credit cards to make purchases</text>
  <text start="429.27" dur="7.39">while they&amp;#39;re increasing their debt</text>
  <text start="431.91" dur="8.38">their savings is declining this is a</text>
  <text start="436.66" dur="6.03">disaster waiting to happen now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="440.29" dur="5.16">been discussing retail stores we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="442.69" dur="4.92">discussing malls and there&amp;#39;s a new</text>
  <text start="445.45" dur="4.05">report out there that shed some light on</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="3.23">all of this this is from Green Street</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="3.83">Advisors</text>
  <text start="450.84" dur="5.93">a property research firm they analyzed</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="6.72">about 950 more locations over 2017 and</text>
  <text start="456.77" dur="5.5">what they&amp;#39;ve been finding is that well</text>
  <text start="460.05" dur="2.73">the retail market is a lot worse than we</text>
  <text start="462.27" dur="5.1">thought</text>
  <text start="462.78" dur="8.76">now out of the 950 more locations 230</text>
  <text start="467.37" dur="7.32">are collateralized with in commercial</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="6.54">mortgage-backed securities sound kind of</text>
  <text start="474.69" dur="5.34">some similar to the subprime security</text>
  <text start="478.08" dur="4.619">problem well that&amp;#39;s really what is</text>
  <text start="480.03" dur="10.35">happening here now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="482.699" dur="12.811">here is that these CMBS loans well</text>
  <text start="490.38" dur="7.83">they&amp;#39;ve been packaged and right now this</text>
  <text start="495.51" dur="5.07">is a major problem now to put the mall</text>
  <text start="498.21" dur="4.709">economic model into perspective Green</text>
  <text start="500.58" dur="3.75">Street points out that while massive</text>
  <text start="502.919" dur="3.901">department store closures tend to</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="6.78">dominate headlines they represent a very</text>

  <text start="519.18" dur="6.21">pay of the majority of moley&amp;#39;s income in</text>

  <text start="536.37" dur="4.8">now are making decisions in real time</text>
  <text start="538.83" dur="4.949">within each mall the best in line</text>
  <text start="541.17" dur="4.47">tenants to track are the 300 national</text>
  <text start="543.779" dur="4.291">tenants who have at least 50 more</text>

  <text start="548.07" dur="4.26">judging the performance and cost of</text>

  <text start="552.33" dur="6.21">Green Street says the far more pressing</text>
  <text start="556.26" dur="4.65">issue for mall investors is to analyze</text>
  <text start="558.54" dur="5.46">which stores are quietly shrinking their</text>

  <text start="701.86" dur="4.35">department stores do closed down and</text>
  <text start="703.84" dur="4.8">guess what traffic then dries up and</text>
  <text start="706.21" dur="4.89">those people within the mall structure</text>
  <text start="708.64" dur="4.68">those people start closing down we also</text>
  <text start="711.1" dur="5.01">know those malls with movie theaters</text>
  <text start="713.32" dur="4.41">well they have less traffic the mover</text>
  <text start="716.11" dur="2.19">product movie production companies are</text>
  <text start="717.73" dur="4.2">putting out</text>
  <text start="718.3" dur="7.23">less movies and less people are going to</text>
  <text start="721.93" dur="5.4">the movie theater so we have major major</text>
  <text start="725.53" dur="4.89">problems ahead of us then we have the</text>
  <text start="727.33" dur="5.28">pension problem this brewing pension</text>
  <text start="730.42" dur="4.98">problem well it&amp;#39;s been well documented</text>
  <text start="732.61" dur="7.05">we talked about it before we know that a</text>
  <text start="735.4" dur="6.63">lot of these pensions they assumed a 7.6</text>
  <text start="739.66" dur="4.86">percent rate of return on its assets in</text>
  <text start="742.03" dur="5.1">the future and in order for pensions to</text>
  <text start="744.52" dur="5.97">meet the 7.6 percent rate of return they</text>
  <text start="747.13" dur="6.3">require that stocks and to a much lesser</text>
  <text start="750.49" dur="4.89">degree alternatives do far better than</text>
  <text start="753.43" dur="4.11">even the optimistic assumption because</text>
  <text start="755.38" dur="4.17">the balance of the portfolio is nearly</text>
  <text start="757.54" dur="5.33">guaranteed to full short of that mark</text>
  <text start="759.55" dur="6.63">now the trouble is that we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="762.87" dur="6.51">7.6 percent rate of return here we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="766.18" dur="7.41">have eight percent we have what 1</text>
  <text start="769.38" dur="6.01">percent 1.75 percent maybe 2 percent so</text>
  <text start="773.59" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re way off there so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="775.39" dur="4.23">investing in stocks maybe some of these</text>
  <text start="777.61" dur="5.97">more securities which they rated</text>
  <text start="779.62" dur="7.02">triple-a and the trouble with the stock</text>
  <text start="783.58" dur="5.37">market they need to return anywhere near</text>
  <text start="786.64" dur="4.83">8 percent they would need to fall the</text>
  <text start="788.95" dur="5.49">stocks we need to fall more than 50</text>
  <text start="791.47" dur="4.95">percent first and in order for the sp500</text>
  <text start="794.44" dur="4.5">to be priced for an 8 percent expected</text>
  <text start="796.42" dur="5.1">long-term annual return the index would</text>
  <text start="798.94" dur="4.8">presently need to trade at roughly 1281</text>
  <text start="801.52" dur="6.81">which we know it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s trading</text>
  <text start="803.74" dur="8.31">almost double that so right now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="808.33" dur="6.27">a major problem so if the stock market</text>
  <text start="812.05" dur="4.53">crashes for investors so they can have</text>
  <text start="814.6" dur="2.99">that opportunity to invest at a level</text>
  <text start="816.58" dur="3.21">that would enable them to achieve</text>
  <text start="817.59" dur="5.38">anything close to what pensions now</text>
  <text start="819.79" dur="7.53">require well that would destroy the</text>
  <text start="822.97" dur="7.4">pensions but if the rates don&amp;#39;t go up</text>
  <text start="827.32" dur="7.05">and the stock market stays where it is</text>
  <text start="830.37" dur="7.54">they&amp;#39;re screwed anyhow so no matter what</text>
  <text start="834.37" dur="5.91">happens here the pensions the pension</text>
  <text start="837.91" dur="5.31">crisis is still a problem</text>
  <text start="840.28" dur="4.8">you can&amp;#39;t solve it at this point and</text>
  <text start="843.22" dur="4.38">people are going to lose out and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="845.08" dur="3.81">going to be a complete disaster and on</text>
  <text start="847.6" dur="4.14">top of that</text>
  <text start="848.89" dur="7.14">we have the global debt it has hit our</text>
  <text start="851.74" dur="7.38">new record of 233 trillion now if we go</text>
  <text start="856.03" dur="5.61">back in time to 2016 we understand that</text>
  <text start="859.12" dur="5.22">the global debt hit a new all-time high</text>

  <text start="887.01" dur="5.83">233 trillion at the end of the third</text>
  <text start="890.11" dur="7.02">quarter of 2017 now we know that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="892.84" dur="7.61">even higher than that and we see that we</text>
  <text start="897.13" dur="6.99">are in big trouble the global debt is</text>
  <text start="900.45" dur="5.74">continually being pushed up it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="906.19" dur="5.19">better and it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="908.83" dur="5.37">now there&amp;#39;s 63 trillion in government</text>

  <text start="925.81" dur="8.46">and this tells you that as the debt</text>
  <text start="930.91" dur="5.46">continually pushes upward it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="934.27" dur="4.08">sustained because if you look around the</text>
  <text start="936.37" dur="4.62">world a lot of people are out of work</text>

  <text start="951.49" dur="7.95">South Korea Switzerland and Turkey now</text>
  <text start="955.9" dur="5.64">we understand that this entire economy</text>
  <text start="959.44" dur="4.59">has been built on an illusion this is</text>
  <text start="961.54" dur="5.34">why we&amp;#39;ve been looking at each part of</text>
  <text start="964.03" dur="4.5">the economic sectors to make sure that</text>
  <text start="966.88" dur="4.11">we understand what is really going on</text>
  <text start="968.53" dur="5.13">here if we went back in time and we did</text>
  <text start="970.99" dur="5.22">this prior to 2008 we would have said</text>
  <text start="973.66" dur="3.99">okay the subprime securities they are</text>
  <text start="976.21" dur="2.58">garbage there&amp;#39;s no way they&amp;#39;re rated</text>
  <text start="977.65" dur="2.97">triple-a and of course people would</text>
  <text start="978.79" dur="3.84">argue back then and say well there are</text>
  <text start="980.62" dur="3.839">rated triple-a COEs SMP</text>
  <text start="982.63" dur="3.84">and the rest that they are and we would</text>
  <text start="984.459" dur="4.261">have to say no we proved it look look</text>
  <text start="986.47" dur="4.08">inside they are not Triple A we would</text>
  <text start="988.72" dur="3.09">have said hey look something&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="990.55" dur="3.36">with the housing market something</text>
  <text start="991.81" dur="4.11">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense here a lot of</text>
  <text start="993.91" dur="4.289">speculators out there and it looks like</text>
  <text start="995.92" dur="3.63">this is one gigantic bubble again people</text>
  <text start="998.199" dur="2.551">would look at this and say no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="999.55" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s not right</text>
  <text start="1000.75" dur="4.41">housing this fine housing can&amp;#39;t go down</text>
  <text start="1002.79" dur="4.169">and they would use all the same</text>
  <text start="1005.16" dur="6.27">arguments that they&amp;#39;re using today and</text>
  <text start="1006.959" dur="7.141">back then in 2006-2007 people thought</text>
  <text start="1011.43" dur="5.519">things were fantastic they were spending</text>
  <text start="1014.1" dur="5.159">like crazy well here we are once again</text>
  <text start="1016.949" dur="4.921">but this time it&amp;#39;s a lot worse because</text>
  <text start="1019.259" dur="3.781">nothing&amp;#39;s been fixed actually what you</text>
  <text start="1021.87" dur="3.449">can see they&amp;#39;ve been doing is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1023.04" dur="4.619">they&amp;#39;ve taken the problem of 2008 and</text>
  <text start="1025.319" dur="5.161">they just extended it with the same</text>
  <text start="1027.659" dur="5.191">exact illusion they didn&amp;#39;t change</text>
  <text start="1030.48" dur="4.859">anything the stock market&amp;#39;s going up</text>
  <text start="1032.85" dur="4.229">just like it did prior to 2008 back then</text>
  <text start="1035.339" dur="4.771">and only had 14,000 points who cares</text>
  <text start="1037.079" dur="5.49">today hit 25,000 prior to that</text>
  <text start="1040.11" dur="5.069">what did hit 10,000 prior to that would</text>
  <text start="1042.569" dur="4.23">it hit 8,000 back in the 70s when we</text>
  <text start="1045.179" dur="4.38">went into a recession it hit an all-time</text>
  <text start="1046.799" dur="6.081">high of a thousand it makes no</text>
  <text start="1049.559" dur="6.75">difference that&amp;#39;s not the economy and</text>
  <text start="1052.88" dur="6.72">what is happening here is that we in</text>
  <text start="1056.309" dur="7.261">this country the Trump administration is</text>
  <text start="1059.6" dur="7.78">prepping the economy for the transition</text>
  <text start="1063.57" dur="8.219">and we can see this right now now the</text>
  <text start="1067.38" dur="7.47">corporate tax cut that he did was to</text>
  <text start="1071.789" dur="5.791">bring back all that currency that is out</text>
  <text start="1074.85" dur="4.92">in Europe out of the banks and bring it</text>
  <text start="1077.58" dur="5.729">back to the country here is this gonna</text>
  <text start="1079.77" dur="8.31">fix the problem no and I think part of</text>
  <text start="1083.309" dur="7.471">this is to break the system to break and</text>
  <text start="1088.08" dur="5.4">bring down the system because everyone</text>
  <text start="1090.78" dur="5.129">knows yes everyone knows the central</text>
  <text start="1093.48" dur="4.17">banks know Trump knows the Democrats</text>
  <text start="1095.909" dur="3.931">know the Republicans know they all know</text>
  <text start="1097.65" dur="4.139">this system can&amp;#39;t stay up they know the</text>
  <text start="1099.84" dur="3.36">real numbers they&amp;#39;re in government yes</text>
  <text start="1101.789" dur="2.791">they might pretend that everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1103.2" dur="2.67">great because they&amp;#39;re getting all the</text>
  <text start="1104.58" dur="2.64">free money from the central bank and a</text>
  <text start="1105.87" dur="3.75">lot of them are paid off corrupt and</text>
  <text start="1107.22" dur="5.49">blah blah blah but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1109.62" dur="6.75">here is there&amp;#39;s a reason for all of this</text>
  <text start="1112.71" dur="5.49">now the tax cuts to corporations</text>
  <text start="1116.37" dur="3.75">going to bring all that money out of the</text>
  <text start="1118.2" dur="4.2">banks in Europe and bring it back to the</text>
  <text start="1120.12" dur="5.22">United States that will help the United</text>
  <text start="1122.4" dur="6.21">States for a little bit longer now what</text>
  <text start="1125.34" dur="5.85">will it do to the banks in Europe most</text>
  <text start="1128.61" dur="6.27">likely bring them down where will the</text>
  <text start="1131.19" dur="5.64">crash begin most likely in that area the</text>
  <text start="1134.88" dur="5.46">United States will probably be last this</text>
  <text start="1136.83" dur="4.979">was a temporary solution to give the</text>
  <text start="1140.34" dur="3.48">United States a little bit more time</text>
  <text start="1141.809" dur="4.021">because what country is the reserve</text>
  <text start="1143.82" dur="4.83">currency of the world the United States</text>
  <text start="1145.83" dur="6.38">and this is exactly what is happening</text>
  <text start="1148.65" dur="6.3">here now we need to understand that</text>
  <text start="1152.21" dur="6.219">Trump wants to push this infrastructure</text>
  <text start="1154.95" dur="8.01">bill now how is this infrastructure bill</text>
  <text start="1158.429" dur="8.481">going to work well we know that China is</text>

  <text start="1372" dur="3.72">everything that happening here and this</text>
  <text start="1374.46" dur="4.59">is what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do</text>
  <text start="1375.72" dur="6.54">because once the people get wind that</text>
  <text start="1379.05" dur="4.44">this is the same exact system well the</text>
  <text start="1382.26" dur="2.73">people are going to speak out</text>
  <text start="1383.49" dur="4.319">is what the central banks don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1384.99" dur="6.42">happen so this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="1387.809" dur="6.631">here over the many years since the even</text>
  <text start="1391.41" dur="5.58">before 2008 but it&amp;#39;s been accelerated</text>
  <text start="1394.44" dur="5.16">after 2008 because they realized right</text>
  <text start="1396.99" dur="5.189">now how bad the situation is how it was</text>
  <text start="1399.6" dur="5.579">accelerating they can&amp;#39;t stop it and they</text>
  <text start="1402.179" dur="4.081">need to make this transition soon so</text>
  <text start="1405.179" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;ve been putting everything into</text>
  <text start="1406.26" dur="5.1">place and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1408.809" dur="4.531">there&amp;#39;s a fight going on between</text>
  <text start="1411.36" dur="4.05">different factions within the government</text>
  <text start="1413.34" dur="3.21">with the central bank and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1415.41" dur="1.92">something where you can snap your finger</text>
  <text start="1416.55" dur="2.61">and just have it done</text>
  <text start="1417.33" dur="3.15">if you ever worked in a corporation and</text>
  <text start="1419.16" dur="2.79">you were in middle management where</text>
  <text start="1420.48" dur="3.21">you&amp;#39;re an upper management and you still</text>
  <text start="1421.95" dur="4.08">had someone above that and there are</text>
  <text start="1423.69" dur="4.53">other people around you saying no you</text>
  <text start="1426.03" dur="3.84">know how hard it is to get things done</text>
  <text start="1428.22" dur="4.05">the same thing is happening in</text>
  <text start="1429.87" dur="4.92">government right now but things are</text>
  <text start="1432.27" dur="4.68">changing but we&amp;#39;re still going through a</text>
  <text start="1434.79" dur="4.53">transition things are gonna be very</text>
  <text start="1436.95" dur="3.69">messy it&amp;#39;s not going to be clean the</text>
  <text start="1439.32" dur="4.47">snap of a finger everything&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="1440.64" dur="5.88">great coming on to a system where it was</text>
  <text start="1443.79" dur="5.13">backed by the buy oil back in the 70s</text>
  <text start="1446.52" dur="4.71">coming off the gold system well we were</text>
  <text start="1448.92" dur="4.38">coming off a stable system going on to a</text>
  <text start="1451.23" dur="5.1">brand new system with very very low debt</text>
  <text start="1453.3" dur="5.22">and look what happened there people</text>
  <text start="1456.33" dur="4.92">couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs there was high</text>
  <text start="1458.52" dur="4.65">inflation people like that because they</text>
  <text start="1461.25" dur="4.23">were printing a lot of currency at that</text>
  <text start="1463.17" dur="4.44">time so they got the high interest rates</text>
  <text start="1465.48" dur="5.04">they were able to earn a lot on their</text>
  <text start="1467.61" dur="4.62">currency in CDs and things like that but</text>
  <text start="1470.52" dur="4.5">people couldn&amp;#39;t find could couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1472.23" dur="5.34">fuel credit was kind of frozen at that</text>
  <text start="1475.02" dur="4.8">time jobs were very hard to come by it</text>
  <text start="1477.57" dur="4.05">was kind of a mess in the 70s but then</text>
  <text start="1479.82" dur="3.75">it it did improve in the 80s and this is</text>
  <text start="1481.62" dur="3.66">how their system usually works then the</text>
  <text start="1483.57" dur="3.9">90s and then all of a sudden starts</text>
  <text start="1485.28" dur="4.56">breaking down into 2000 and as we</text>
  <text start="1487.47" dur="3.839">approach where we are today it gets even</text>
  <text start="1489.84" dur="3.69">worse now we&amp;#39;re coming off the system</text>
  <text start="1491.309" dur="5.101">we&amp;#39;re not backed by gold we&amp;#39;re backed by</text>
  <text start="1493.53" dur="5.19">debt and we can see that we&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="1496.41" dur="4.5">our grip in the Middle East so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1498.72" dur="4.56">seeing the back side of this and the</text>
  <text start="1500.91" dur="5.73">back side of this is not going to be</text>
  <text start="1503.28" dur="5.91">pleasant especially when everything is</text>
  <text start="1506.64" dur="4.47">moved away from the United States and</text>
  <text start="1509.19" dur="3.6">moved someplace else</text>
  <text start="1511.11" dur="3.87">remember when we were coming on to the</text>
  <text start="1512.79" dur="4.08">system the United States was the reserve</text>
  <text start="1514.98" dur="5.43">currency backed by gold and it was</text>
  <text start="1516.87" dur="5.73">the reserve currency backed by oil now</text>
  <text start="1520.41" dur="3.899">the United States is no longer going to</text>

  <text start="1524.309" dur="5.371">shifted away from the United States and</text>
  <text start="1526.68" dur="5.01">this is going to have a ripple effect</text>
  <text start="1529.68" dur="4.35">within the United States and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1531.69" dur="4.32">to be very very difficult for people and</text>
  <text start="1534.03" dur="4.59">this is why I&amp;#39;ve been saying get ready</text>
