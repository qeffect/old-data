  <text start="112.569" dur="5.101">might declare bankruptcy well it looks</text>
  <text start="114.97" dur="5.33">like Puerto Rico they have filed for</text>
  <text start="117.67" dur="5.25">bankruptcy and we can see right now that</text>

  <text start="139.2" dur="5.29">municipal debt restructuring and further</text>
  <text start="142.26" dur="4.03">complicating the US territories efforts</text>
  <text start="144.49" dur="4.92">to pull itself out of this financial</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="5.43">crisis now the Puerto Rico restructuring</text>
  <text start="149.41" dur="3.33">is going to be much larger than</text>
  <text start="151.72" dur="3.93">Detroit&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.74" dur="4.77">record-setting bankruptcy the board has</text>
  <text start="155.65" dur="4.55">agreed to submit title three protection</text>
  <text start="157.51" dur="6.479">immediately and they will submit it and</text>
  <text start="160.2" dur="6.34">the financial collapse well it promises</text>
  <text start="163.989" dur="5.071">to impose deep losses on bondholders who</text>
  <text start="166.54" dur="4.68">for years snapped up Puerto Rico</text>
  <text start="169.06" dur="5.87">securities because they thought that</text>
  <text start="171.22" dur="7.59">Puerto Rico would not file bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="6.61">because US states can&amp;#39;t file for</text>
  <text start="178.81" dur="5.519">bankruptcy and investors while they</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="4.979">these bonds assured that it wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="184.329" dur="3.36">legal option for Puerto Rico but it</text>
  <text start="186.519" dur="3.33">looks like they were completely wrong</text>
  <text start="187.689" dur="5.16">because they just filed and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="189.849" dur="4.681">see this is a huge problem we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="192.849" dur="6.39">have to see what kind of effect this has</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="7.94">on the economy and most likely this will</text>
  <text start="199.239" dur="5.7">be covered up by those who are in power</text>
  <text start="202.47" dur="5.889">someway somehow</text>
  <text start="204.939" dur="5.401">they will they always do and what will</text>
  <text start="208.359" dur="4.591">happen is there will be something that</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="3.989">occurs where they won&amp;#39;t be able to cover</text>
  <text start="212.95" dur="3.39">it up they won&amp;#39;t be able to stop it</text>
  <text start="214.329" dur="4.291">it&amp;#39;ll be like an avalanche where it</text>
  <text start="216.34" dur="4.229">continually gains speed where they try</text>
  <text start="218.62" dur="4.709">to block it they try to cover it up but</text>
  <text start="220.569" dur="4.651">they just can&amp;#39;t do it now the EU is</text>
  <text start="223.329" dur="7.44">doing whatever they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="225.22" dur="7.889">the EU countries within the EU and what</text>
  <text start="230.769" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they have up</text>
  <text start="233.109" dur="6.121">the ante they&amp;#39;re saying that the brexit</text>
  <text start="236.139" dur="6.901">bill is being pushed up from sixty</text>
  <text start="239.23" dur="6.649">billion euros to a hundred billion euros</text>
  <text start="243.04" dur="5.699">now the new figure reflects a stricter</text>
  <text start="245.879" dur="4.301">demand made by Germany and France in</text>
  <text start="248.739" dur="3.84">particular in relation to the post</text>
  <text start="250.18" dur="4.919">brexit farm payments and EU</text>
  <text start="252.579" dur="5.4">administration fees and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="255.099" dur="5.971">seeing right now is that they want to</text>
  <text start="257.979" dur="6.18">make sure that none of these countries</text>
  <text start="261.07" dur="6.54">leave and they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="264.159" dur="6.121">possibly can to stop this now here in</text>
  <text start="267.61" dur="5.369">the United States we see adp came out</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="4.23">with their employment numbers and it is</text>
  <text start="272.979" dur="5.31">not starting to look good and actually</text>
  <text start="274.51" dur="5.189">they revised march numbers down from two</text>
  <text start="278.289" dur="3.06">hundred fifty-three thousand to two</text>
  <text start="279.699" dur="3.871">hundred fifty five and i&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="281.349" dur="5.19">be another revision but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.57" dur="4.95">seeing right now is that april adp job</text>
  <text start="286.539" dur="4.591">numbers they have tumbled to a hundred</text>
  <text start="288.52" dur="4.98">and seventy seven thousand and this is</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="6.45">the lowest growth in job since October</text>
  <text start="293.5" dur="6.27">of 2016 this is pre Trump now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="4.47">seeing that the collapse of is m&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.77" dur="5.61">manufacturing and services employment</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="6.299">some indices they were a contributing</text>
  <text start="305.38" dur="4.86">factor to all of this and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.349" dur="4.651">seeing is that these numbers are</text>
  <text start="310.24" dur="4.92">reflecting kind of what is happening</text>
  <text start="313" dur="3.81">here in the United States remember</text>
  <text start="315.16" dur="3.78">most of this is manipulated and these</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="4.05">bounced up and down as they revised</text>
  <text start="318.94" dur="3.81">numbers push jobs into different</text>
  <text start="320.86" dur="4.26">quarters and they try to make it look</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="4.53">good as possible and where they have to</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="4.35">manipulate even further they do do this</text>
  <text start="327.28" dur="4.32">if we look at the BLS numbers these are</text>
  <text start="329.47" dur="3.57">completely manipulated and all those</text>
  <text start="331.6" dur="4.26">people that haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview</text>
  <text start="333.04" dur="4.68">for in the last four weeks they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="335.86" dur="3.45">not even counted and when we look at all</text>
  <text start="337.72" dur="3.36">these retail stores that are closing</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="3.87">right now you would think oh my god look</text>
  <text start="341.08" dur="5.16">at all these jobs that they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.18" dur="5.01">losing these jobs and it&amp;#39;s going to show</text>
  <text start="346.24" dur="4.44">that unemployment is going up now what</text>
  <text start="348.19" dur="4.14">happens is when these individuals have</text>
  <text start="350.68" dur="3.84">these jobs the part-time jobs are</text>
  <text start="352.33" dur="6.15">counted as a full-time job when they</text>
  <text start="354.52" dur="6.42">lose the job it goes by state and each</text>
  <text start="358.48" dur="3.75">state has different requirements where</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="3.93">they look at the number of hours you</text>
  <text start="362.23" dur="5.16">work and they look at the number the the</text>
  <text start="364.87" dur="3.81">amount that you receive and pay and if</text>
  <text start="367.39" dur="5.55">it doesn&amp;#39;t meet that requirement and</text>
  <text start="368.68" dur="7.11">you&amp;#39;re under there their level you are</text>
  <text start="372.94" dur="5.52">considered a part-time job so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="375.79" dur="4.44">just not counted if you&amp;#39;re above it then</text>
  <text start="378.46" dur="4.62">you&amp;#39;re a full-time job and then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.23" dur="5.4">counted so most of these jobs well</text>
  <text start="383.08" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re just not going to be counted so</text>
  <text start="385.63" dur="3.6">when you look at what is happening here</text>
  <text start="387.58" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re just going to say well not that</text>
  <text start="389.23" dur="5.16">many people lost jobs but they have even</text>
  <text start="392.38" dur="4.11">the people that are working two or three</text>
  <text start="394.39" dur="4.529">part-time jobs where they weren&amp;#39;t making</text>
  <text start="396.49" dur="4.44">the level of money or working the number</text>
  <text start="398.919" dur="3.781">of hours even though they were working</text>
  <text start="400.93" dur="3.63">three jobs which is counted as three</text>
  <text start="402.7" dur="4.56">full-time jobs when they lose them</text>
  <text start="404.56" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re not counted as three full-time</text>
  <text start="407.26" dur="4.53">jobs that are lost if they&amp;#39;re making it</text>
  <text start="409.21" dur="4.1">under that certain level and you can see</text>
  <text start="411.79" dur="4.05">how this whole thing is completely</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="4.66">manipulated to make you believe in think</text>
  <text start="415.84" dur="5.34">that the unemployment number is near</text>
  <text start="417.97" dur="6.9">full capacity where everyone is working</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="6.12">which this is not true whatsoever now we</text>
  <text start="424.87" dur="5.97">talked about the auto industry and how</text>
  <text start="427.3" dur="6">the subprime debt bubble is continually</text>
  <text start="430.84" dur="4.56">growing and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="433.3" dur="4.64">is that US auto manufacturers while they</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="6.45">miss their sales projections and</text>
  <text start="437.94" dur="7.78">compared to one year ago sales were way</text>
  <text start="441.85" dur="5.879">down across the entire industry when you</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="3.3">add this latest news to all other</text>
  <text start="447.729" dur="4.261">signals of the US economy</text>
  <text start="449.02" dur="6.149">slowly down substantially a very</text>
  <text start="451.99" dur="5.37">disturbing picture is being created</text>
  <text start="455.169" dur="4.441">right in front of our eyes and when we</text>
  <text start="457.36" dur="5.19">look at it all alone generation has gone</text>
  <text start="459.61" dur="6.33">absolutely vertical since 2009 right</text>
  <text start="462.55" dur="5.88">rising an incredible 56 percent in seven</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="5.34">years even more incredibly roughly</text>
  <text start="468.43" dur="5.94">one-third of this 450 billion in new</text>
  <text start="471.28" dur="5.669">loans while their subprime and you know</text>
  <text start="474.37" dur="4.56">what that means they&amp;#39;re garbage and when</text>
  <text start="476.949" dur="3.631">we look at the auto manufacturers we see</text>
  <text start="478.93" dur="3.87">that General Motors is down by negative</text>
  <text start="480.58" dur="3.679">five point eight percent Ford is down by</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="4.53">negative seven point one percent</text>
  <text start="484.259" dur="5.051">Chrysler down seven percent Toyota down</text>
  <text start="487.33" dur="5.28">four point four percent Hana down seven</text>
  <text start="489.31" dur="5.009">percent and you can see this is not a</text>
  <text start="492.61" dur="4.47">very good situation</text>
  <text start="494.319" dur="5.731">these are frightening numbers they are</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="4.98">losing sales and remember a lot of these</text>
  <text start="500.05" dur="3.929">manufacturers they&amp;#39;ve been channel stuff</text>
  <text start="502.06" dur="4.289">in their lives and every time they</text>
  <text start="503.979" dur="4.56">channel stuff that is considered a sale</text>
  <text start="506.349" dur="4.051">that means the Manufacturing&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="508.539" dur="3.99">manufacturers are bringing cars into the</text>
  <text start="510.4" dur="3.87">Lots and they&amp;#39;re saying these are sales</text>
  <text start="512.529" dur="4.89">they don&amp;#39;t wait for the sale to actually</text>
  <text start="514.27" dur="5.04">happen to a person and the sales are</text>
  <text start="517.419" dur="4.951">down and they&amp;#39;ve been giving incentives</text>
  <text start="519.31" dur="5.7">like crazy so things are not working out</text>
  <text start="522.37" dur="5.339">well whatsoever now a new survey from</text>
  <text start="525.01" dur="4.38">Northwestern Mutual helps to shed some</text>
  <text start="527.709" dur="5.88">light on why Americans are completely</text>
  <text start="529.39" dur="6.78">incapable of saving money and using this</text>
  <text start="533.589" dur="6.81">money to purchase automobiles or</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="6.539">products in retail first roughly fifty</text>
  <text start="540.399" dur="5.19">percent of Americans have debt balances</text>
  <text start="542.709" dur="5.701">excluded mortgages over twenty five</text>
  <text start="545.589" dur="4.56">thousand dollars with average person</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="4.98">owing around thirty seven thousand</text>
  <text start="550.149" dur="6.601">versus a meeting personal income of just</text>
  <text start="553.39" dur="5.939">over thirty thousand this is a big</text>
  <text start="556.75" dur="4.86">problem so therefore it&amp;#39;s not difficult</text>
  <text start="559.329" dur="6.121">to believe as Northwestern Mutual points</text>
  <text start="561.61" dur="5.789">out that 45% of Americans spend up to</text>
  <text start="565.45" dur="5.34">half of their monthly take-home pay on</text>
  <text start="567.399" dur="6.63">debt service alone which again excludes</text>
  <text start="570.79" dur="6.98">mortgage debt so this situation that</text>
  <text start="574.029" dur="6.87">we&amp;#39;re in is dire it is getting worse</text>
  <text start="577.77" dur="4.36">every single day and we look back a year</text>
  <text start="580.899" dur="2.941">ago at</text>
  <text start="582.13" dur="3.81">the auto manufacturers when we talked</text>
  <text start="583.84" dur="5.31">about the channel stuffing and how cars</text>
  <text start="585.94" dur="5.67">sales are incredible and the auto loan</text>
  <text start="589.15" dur="4.41">bubble was continually being inflated</text>
  <text start="591.61" dur="3.54">and everyone&amp;#39;s saying wow this is never</text>
  <text start="593.56" dur="3.48">going to stop the auto industry they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="595.15" dur="3.48">going to just keep selling cars what we</text>
  <text start="597.04" dur="4.32">knew eventually it was going to hit the</text>
  <text start="598.63" dur="4.77">top and we knew that eventually the</text>
  <text start="601.36" dur="3.96">people will be tapped out eventually</text>
  <text start="603.4" dur="3.81">when you go from those people that have</text>
  <text start="605.32" dur="4.11">good credit down to the people that have</text>
  <text start="607.21" dur="4.83">subprime credit down to the people below</text>
  <text start="609.43" dur="4.2">the subprime people we know you run out</text>
  <text start="612.04" dur="3.57">of people and then you start adding</text>
  <text start="613.63" dur="4.32">incentives into this to push the sales</text>
  <text start="615.61" dur="4.95">and when all this stops and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="617.95" dur="4.14">work anymore you&amp;#39;re in this situation</text>
  <text start="620.56" dur="2.91">that we&amp;#39;re in right now where everything</text>
  <text start="622.09" dur="3.09">is starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="623.47" dur="4.32">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="625.18" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re just talking about debt is that</text>
  <text start="627.79" dur="5.13">the government the corporate media no</text>
  <text start="630.01" dur="5.4">one&amp;#39;s even talking about the debt</text>
  <text start="632.92" dur="4.41">problem in America where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="635.41" dur="4.29">approaching the debt ceiling yes the</text>
  <text start="637.33" dur="3.75">budget was passed and everyone is happy</text>
  <text start="639.7" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re going to be spending another</text>
  <text start="641.08" dur="4.53">trillion dollars but where are they</text>

  <text start="654.4" dur="4.8">have to look at the debt ceiling problem</text>
  <text start="656.23" dur="6">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="659.2" dur="6.75">this debt is going to continually rise</text>
  <text start="662.23" dur="7.71">and we&amp;#39;re going to add another trillion</text>

  <text start="692.14" dur="4.38">as time goes on now what&amp;#39;s very</text>

  <text start="696.52" dur="5.13">about the stock market and we talked</text>
  <text start="699.28" dur="4.23">about a classic bubble scenario and the</text>
  <text start="701.65" dur="4.35">stock market is in that classic bubble</text>
  <text start="703.51" dur="6.27">scenario right now because what is</text>
  <text start="706" dur="6.06">happening is those insiders they have</text>
  <text start="709.78" dur="5.2">been jumping ship and selling their</text>
  <text start="712.06" dur="6.67">stocks now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="714.98" dur="5.359">is that the major indexes they&amp;#39;re all at</text>

  <text start="746.48" dur="6.06">are cashing out why should investors</text>
  <text start="749.18" dur="6.839">keep buying at current prices this is</text>
  <text start="752.54" dur="4.979">definitely a negative sign because those</text>

  <text start="764.81" dur="6.63">going to turn this is what happens in a</text>
  <text start="768.17" dur="5.279">bubble situation the insiders who blown</text>
  <text start="771.44" dur="5.1">the bubbles up who bought back their own</text>
  <text start="773.449" dur="4.83">shares continually did this where banks</text>
  <text start="776.54" dur="4.229">have taken the free money from the Fed</text>
  <text start="778.279" dur="5.521">and pumped it into the stock market they</text>
  <text start="780.769" dur="5.88">are now selling off to retail investors</text>

  <text start="788.54" dur="4.47">companies they are trying to dump their</text>
  <text start="790.91" dur="4.71">homes right now they&amp;#39;re telling you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="793.01" dur="5.4">a great time to flip it&amp;#39;s fantastic</text>
  <text start="795.62" dur="6.24">everyone get in all you mom-and-pop</text>
  <text start="798.41" dur="6.869">speculators get into the market they do</text>
  <text start="801.86" dur="6.36">this on purpose because they realize and</text>
  <text start="805.279" dur="4.441">they understand what is happening and we</text>
  <text start="808.22" dur="5.94">can see it right in front of our faces</text>
  <text start="809.72" dur="7.109">now the said just signaled that they are</text>
  <text start="814.16" dur="3.9">going to bring this economy down I mean</text>
  <text start="816.829" dur="3.721">think about what they just said today</text>
  <text start="818.06" dur="5.219">they had their meeting today and they</text>
  <text start="820.55" dur="3.029">said that the economy looks pretty darn</text>
  <text start="823.279" dur="4.17">good</text>
  <text start="823.579" dur="8.31">except for this slowdown in the first</text>
  <text start="827.449" dur="6.87">quarter and it&amp;#39;s really transitory but</text>
  <text start="831.889" dur="5.371">the labor market is fantastic they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="834.319" dur="6.871">seeing solid gains inflation is around</text>
  <text start="837.26" dur="6.689">2% and everything looks fantastic which</text>
  <text start="841.19" dur="4.829">means when they meet in June most likely</text>
  <text start="843.949" dur="4.561">they&amp;#39;re going to raise the interest</text>
  <text start="846.019" dur="2.731">rates they haven&amp;#39;t backed off think</text>
  <text start="848.51" dur="1.62">about</text>
  <text start="848.75" dur="3.84">if they backed off right now and they</text>
  <text start="850.13" dur="5.67">said whoa hey the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="852.59" dur="5.4">well right now so we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="855.8" dur="3.63">raise interest rates for the rest of the</text>
  <text start="857.99" dur="4.05">year actually we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="859.43" dur="5.73">start lowering it right now no if they</text>
  <text start="862.04" dur="4.68">started to do that people would say wait</text>
  <text start="865.16" dur="3.75">a minute what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="866.72" dur="4.68">one minute you&amp;#39;re telling us the economy</text>
  <text start="868.91" dur="4.59">is strong the next minute you&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="871.4" dur="4.26">us that it&amp;#39;s not strong and you have to</text>
  <text start="873.5" dur="4.59">lower rates or you&amp;#39;re not going to raise</text>
  <text start="875.66" dur="5.22">rates anymore what they&amp;#39;re telling you</text>
  <text start="878.09" dur="6.3">right now is that it&amp;#39;s transitory that</text>
  <text start="880.88" dur="5.46">the economy is still strong and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="884.39" dur="4.73">still on track they want everyone to</text>
  <text start="886.34" dur="7.68">believe that everything is still fine</text>
  <text start="889.12" dur="7.33">because remember their entire plan is to</text>
  <text start="894.02" dur="5.7">make sure that the blame doesn&amp;#39;t sit</text>
  <text start="896.45" dur="6.24">with them and they&amp;#39;re most likely going</text>
  <text start="899.72" dur="6.69">to manipulate the next gdb numbers that</text>
  <text start="902.69" dur="6.84">are coming up because as we know what</text>
  <text start="906.41" dur="5.85">makes up GDP well 70% of it is spending</text>
  <text start="909.53" dur="5.13">what is included in the spending Obama</text>
  <text start="912.26" dur="4.02">care we know Obama care is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="914.66" dur="3.63">and many people are opting out of</text>
  <text start="916.28" dur="4.65">spending for health insurance so that is</text>
  <text start="918.29" dur="6.12">not helping gp whatsoever but if we go</text>
  <text start="920.93" dur="6.44">back to a pre-election right before the</text>
  <text start="924.41" dur="5.22">elections they manipulated the GDP by</text>
  <text start="927.37" dur="4.63">exporting soybeans and they brought that</text>
  <text start="929.63" dur="3.93">number up to like two point seven or two</text>
  <text start="932" dur="4.41">point eight percent whatever that was</text>
  <text start="933.56" dur="4.26">and they said Wow look how great the</text>
  <text start="936.41" dur="3.75">economy is and this was right for the</text>
  <text start="937.82" dur="5.34">right before the elections they will</text>
  <text start="940.16" dur="5.1">manipulate it once again will they make</text>
  <text start="943.16" dur="4.62">it that high no but they&amp;#39;ll make it a</text>
  <text start="945.26" dur="5.13">lot better than it really seems why so</text>
  <text start="947.78" dur="4.68">they can raise their rates because they</text>
  <text start="950.39" dur="4.02">have to be on track right now because</text>
  <text start="952.46" dur="4.92">they realize many understand that the</text>
  <text start="954.41" dur="6.09">economy will not be able to survive and</text>
  <text start="957.38" dur="5.85">if it crashes with then not raising the</text>
  <text start="960.5" dur="5.73">rates and it crashes in the way that</text>
  <text start="963.23" dur="4.859">Trump wants to crash it he&amp;#39;ll control</text>
  <text start="966.23" dur="3.96">the narrative because he&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="968.089" dur="4.381">crash it and say hey everyone I did it</text>
  <text start="970.19" dur="5.01">I&amp;#39;m the one who crashed no he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="972.47" dur="5.31">make it look like the central bank did</text>
  <text start="975.2" dur="4.139">it by blowing up the bubbles by doing</text>
  <text start="977.78" dur="3.72">what they&amp;#39;re doing now the central bank</text>
  <text start="979.339" dur="3.211">they&amp;#39;re trying to crash it and bring it</text>
  <text start="981.5" dur="3.21">down on their own</text>
  <text start="982.55" dur="5.13">so this way they control the narrative</text>
  <text start="984.71" dur="4.56">and when I say winner there&amp;#39;s really no</text>
  <text start="987.68" dur="3.63">winner everyone&amp;#39;s a loser when this</text>
  <text start="989.27" dur="4.47">happens but whoever wins they will</text>
  <text start="991.31" dur="5.04">control the narrative and this is the</text>
  <text start="993.74" dur="5.13">fight that&amp;#39;s going on right now right in</text>
  <text start="996.35" dur="4.23">front of our eyes and we can see there</text>
  <text start="998.87" dur="4.05">the central bank is doing the exact same</text>
  <text start="1000.58" dur="4.32">thing they did prior to 2008 they</text>
  <text start="1002.92" dur="3.54">brought the interest rates up things</text>
  <text start="1004.9" dur="3.54">started to fall apart and once they</text>
  <text start="1006.46" dur="3.6">start to fall apart they start lowering</text>
  <text start="1008.44" dur="3.69">it and they&amp;#39;re going to do the same</text>
  <text start="1010.06" dur="4.62">exact thing they&amp;#39;re going to raise the</text>
  <text start="1012.13" dur="4.35">rates things will start rapidly falling</text>
  <text start="1014.68" dur="3.93">apart we&amp;#39;re already seeing it right now</text>
  <text start="1016.48" dur="4.59">but they want it to fall apart in a way</text>
  <text start="1018.61" dur="4.47">where they know there&amp;#39;s no turning back</text>
  <text start="1021.07" dur="4.38">and the system&amp;#39;s just going to crash no</text>
  <text start="1023.08" dur="4.44">matter what they do and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1025.45" dur="3.509">this is where we are headed right now</text>
  <text start="1027.52" dur="4.74">because as soon as the system starts to</text>
  <text start="1028.959" dur="5.431">buckle and fall apart if they are the</text>
  <text start="1032.26" dur="3.48">winners of bringing down the economy</text>
  <text start="1034.39" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re going to reverse all the</text>
  <text start="1035.74" dur="4.32">interest rates they&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="1037.57" dur="4.889">the stimulus once again if Trump wins</text>
  <text start="1040.06" dur="4.29">bringing down this system well guess</text>
  <text start="1042.459" dur="4.561">what he&amp;#39;s going to create the entire</text>
  <text start="1044.35" dur="4.98">narrative to make it look like look we</text>
  <text start="1047.02" dur="4.8">did what the central bank wanted we did</text>
  <text start="1049.33" dur="5.04">what has been done over many many years</text>
  <text start="1051.82" dur="5.25">we increased the budget we took out</text>
  <text start="1054.37" dur="4.89">another trillion dollars we pumped up</text>
  <text start="1057.07" dur="5.22">the bubbles the market has been pumped</text>
  <text start="1059.26" dur="5.22">up and the whole system came down who is</text>
  <text start="1062.29" dur="5.97">to blame for all of this who is the one</text>
  <text start="1064.48" dur="6.6">that was telling us that the economy was</text>
  <text start="1068.26" dur="5.43">fine that everything was perfect who was</text>
