  <text start="70.479" dur="3.571">saying that the retail spending is flat</text>

  <text start="74.05" dur="5.01">cold weather you know consumers just</text>
  <text start="77.02" dur="6.48">don&amp;#39;t want to go out there it&amp;#39;s hurting</text>

  <text start="95.34" dur="4.15">currency it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter what</text>
  <text start="98.32" dur="3.479">the weather is because they keep telling</text>
  <text start="99.49" dur="5.309">us that you have this thing called</text>
  <text start="101.799" dur="4.411">online we can go shopping you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="104.799" dur="3.151">the brick-and-mortar stores and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="106.21" dur="5.67">why these stores are doing so terribly</text>
  <text start="107.95" dur="6.84">at this point but what we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="111.88" dur="5.7">see is all of what they&amp;#39;re saying makes</text>
  <text start="114.79" dur="4.92">no sense people are not switching from</text>
  <text start="117.58" dur="4.71">brick-and-mortar going to online because</text>
  <text start="119.71" dur="6.57">the online sales don&amp;#39;t support it what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.29" dur="6.72">happening is that the people they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="126.28" dur="3.839">have the discretionary funds the people</text>
  <text start="129.01" dur="2.82">aren&amp;#39;t going out saying you know</text>
  <text start="130.119" dur="3.9">something let me go out and just keep</text>
  <text start="131.83" dur="5.85">spending let me just put it on a credit</text>
  <text start="134.019" dur="5.94">card instead people are very nervous</text>
  <text start="137.68" dur="4.2">people are afraid that their jobs are</text>
  <text start="139.959" dur="4.141">going to be lost here in the United</text>
  <text start="141.88" dur="6.03">States what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="144.1" dur="7.02">that april&amp;#39;s sales they&amp;#39;re declining</text>
  <text start="147.91" dur="7.68">they&amp;#39;re not doing well stores like gap</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="8.4">Banana Republic old navys their sales</text>
  <text start="155.59" dur="7.08">have declined we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="159.52" dur="5.57">sales in these stores they have declined</text>
  <text start="162.67" dur="5.43">by seven percent</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="5.26">now of course they&amp;#39;re trying to explain</text>
  <text start="168.1" dur="3.87">away why this is happening you know</text>
  <text start="170.35" dur="4.32">people are not looking for these type of</text>
  <text start="171.97" dur="5.88">clothes anymore you know it&amp;#39;s too sunny</text>
  <text start="174.67" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s too cold it&amp;#39;s too wet they use any</text>
  <text start="177.85" dur="4.17">excuse they possibly can to explain away</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="4.44">why all this is happening but the real</text>
  <text start="182.02" dur="5.76">reason is that when you have 94 million</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="5.85">plus people out of work and then you</text>
  <text start="187.78" dur="6.929">pile on top of that all the people that</text>
  <text start="190.66" dur="7.32">went from a full-time nice paying job to</text>
  <text start="194.709" dur="6.511">a part-time low-paying job guess what</text>
  <text start="197.98" dur="5.7">they just don&amp;#39;t have the funds those</text>
  <text start="201.22" dur="4.2">people who are in a position where they</text>
  <text start="203.68" dur="4.14">see everyone around them getting laid</text>
  <text start="205.42" dur="4.17">off they&amp;#39;re nervous they&amp;#39;re afraid and</text>
  <text start="207.82" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re say you know something let&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="2.64">the brakes on spending at this point</text>
  <text start="211.18" dur="4.32">because I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="212.23" dur="5.37">have a job now the BLS is out there and</text>
  <text start="215.5" dur="5.33">they&amp;#39;re reporting in March that the</text>
  <text start="217.6" dur="6.72">number of job openings it has soared to</text>
  <text start="220.83" dur="8.05">312,000 and now is effectively at its</text>
  <text start="224.32" dur="7.74">all-time high of 5 point million 5.8</text>
  <text start="228.88" dur="5.46">million jobs that are open right now now</text>
  <text start="232.06" dur="6.08">if this number is accurate with the BLS</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="7.25">that is big because we caught them</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="6.25">manipulating the jolts data back in 2013</text>
  <text start="241.59" dur="5.679">what it really means if this is true</text>
  <text start="244.39" dur="4.98">that there&amp;#39;s so many jobs out there the</text>
  <text start="247.269" dur="4.021">Fed should be what hiking the rates at</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="4.86">this point but we know this isn&amp;#39;t true</text>
  <text start="251.29" dur="5.52">and we have to remember how companies</text>
  <text start="254.23" dur="5.22">actually do this and what they do to</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="4.14">push job openings and those people who</text>
  <text start="259.45" dur="3.36">are the working corporations who work in</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="3.95">certain departments realize this they</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="5.4">have these job wrecks that are open and</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="5.2">what happens is the company keeps them</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="4.05">open they don&amp;#39;t want to lose them now</text>
  <text start="270.1" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;ll keep him open even where I was</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="7.53">working way back in 2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="7.319">we would interview people but we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="279.79" dur="6.27">have the clearance to hire anybody it</text>
  <text start="284.229" dur="5.701">was a freeze but they wanted to</text>
  <text start="286.06" dur="6.3">continually bring in people to be</text>
  <text start="289.93" dur="5.01">interviewed or they just wanted to keep</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="4.739">the job req open to show that they had</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="3.15">openings now they were never going to be</text>
  <text start="297.099" dur="2.611">filled and this</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="4.38">is exactly what the current the</text>
  <text start="299.71" dur="4.14">corporations are doing at this point but</text>
  <text start="302.47" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of this</text>
  <text start="303.85" dur="5.19">is that have all these jobs that are</text>
  <text start="305.98" dur="8.01">open but the total number of higher ease</text>
  <text start="309.04" dur="7.59">dropped by 218,000 in March which kind</text>
  <text start="313.99" dur="7.5">of makes no sense this was the second</text>
  <text start="316.63" dur="7.2">biggest drop in hiring since 2013 so</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="4.67">again here we are with the US government</text>
  <text start="323.83" dur="4.68">central bankers the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.16" dur="4.09">manipulating the numbers making it seem</text>
  <text start="328.51" dur="4.409">like everything is fine it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="330.25" dur="4.8">the auto sales once the manufacturer</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="6.451">delivers the cars to the dealership they</text>
  <text start="335.05" dur="6.21">count that as a sale which no one really</text>
  <text start="339.37" dur="4.2">purchased the car it&amp;#39;s sitting on a lot</text>
  <text start="341.26" dur="3.629">and they continually chimo stuff the</text>
  <text start="343.57" dur="3.93">launch with more and more car saying</text>
  <text start="344.889" dur="4.261">look at all the sales we have but what</text>
  <text start="347.5" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="349.15" dur="6.989">really buying the cars well it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="352.18" dur="7.89">same thing with jobs open rex make it</text>
  <text start="356.139" dur="6.061">look good never hire person and we can</text>
  <text start="360.07" dur="4.83">see that this is how they play with a</text>
  <text start="362.2" dur="4.32">lot of these statistical numbers now</text>
  <text start="364.9" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re starting to see other indicators</text>
  <text start="366.52" dur="5.73">in the economy one of them is wholesale</text>
  <text start="369.01" dur="5.909">sales ratio and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="372.25" dur="6.57">wholesale inventories it doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="374.919" dur="6.72">good for the second quarter GDP and what</text>
  <text start="378.82" dur="5.58">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="381.639" dur="8.431">reaching that point where we were right</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="8.22">at the height of 2008 2008 when we had</text>
  <text start="390.07" dur="9.06">that great recession at that point we</text>
  <text start="392.62" dur="9.66">were at 1.4 we are at 1.36 right now so</text>
  <text start="399.13" dur="7.259">inventory to cells they are near record</text>
  <text start="402.28" dur="8.609">highs automotive inventories continued</text>
  <text start="406.389" dur="6.421">to build as sales collapse and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.889" dur="6.171">almost at that point where we were right</text>
  <text start="412.81" dur="7.47">at 2008 will we have the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="417.06" dur="9.13">we&amp;#39;re halfway there during that period</text>
  <text start="420.28" dur="7.59">we&amp;#39;re at 2.4 we are now at 1.83 so we</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="5.21">can see everything is building to that</text>
  <text start="427.87" dur="5.269">point and what we</text>
  <text start="431.4" dur="4.53">seeing right now is that these</text>
  <text start="433.139" dur="6.03">indicators are flashing a red signal</text>
  <text start="435.93" dur="7.23">saying we are heading into this collapse</text>
  <text start="439.169" dur="6.421">scenario now we&amp;#39;ve been in a recession /</text>
  <text start="443.16" dur="4.229">depression now the government the</text>
  <text start="445.59" dur="4.169">corporate media they&amp;#39;re never going to</text>
  <text start="447.389" dur="4.021">admit to it because the stock market</text>
  <text start="449.759" dur="3.361">continually goes up or they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="451.41" dur="4.41">trying to keep it level at this point in</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="5.04">time but as soon as the market comes</text>
  <text start="455.82" dur="4.5">down they might not even admit it at</text>
  <text start="458.16" dur="4.62">that point they might say there&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="460.32" dur="4.11">know problems in the economy but don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="462.78" dur="4.47">worry the feds going to step in with QE</text>
  <text start="464.43" dur="4.98">4 and fix it but when things rapidly</text>
  <text start="467.25" dur="5.13">fall apart it will take them a little</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="4.17">while to actually admit it but what</text>
  <text start="472.38" dur="3.599">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on with</text>
  <text start="473.58" dur="4.68">manufacturing GDP retail contracting</text>
  <text start="475.979" dur="4.171">housing bubble popping things are</text>
  <text start="478.26" dur="3.45">rapidly falling apart at this time and</text>
  <text start="480.15" dur="4.889">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="6">Baltic Dry Index it has fallen to 594</text>
  <text start="485.039" dur="5.011">points down another 22 points so those</text>
  <text start="487.71" dur="5.1">good times are completely over at this</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="6.179">point and we can see the smart money in</text>
  <text start="492.81" dur="6.78">the market well they realized something</text>
  <text start="496.229" dur="6.211">is wrong here and for the 15th week in a</text>
  <text start="499.59" dur="5.07">row we&amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;#39;re getting out of</text>
  <text start="502.44" dur="3.75">the market Bank of America clients they</text>
  <text start="504.66" dur="5.34">were net sellers of US stocks for the</text>
  <text start="506.19" dur="5.94">15th week in the amount of 1.3 billion</text>
  <text start="510" dur="6.979">dollars this is the longest</text>
  <text start="512.13" dur="8.43">uninterrupted selling streak since 2008</text>
  <text start="516.979" dur="7.331">previously the longest streak was 12</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="8.19">weeks back in 2010 so we have already</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="7.2">bypassed that already now we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="528.75" dur="4.35">this happen back in 2008 I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="531.51" dur="4.98">everyone remembers when we had the</text>
  <text start="533.1" dur="4.77">subprime problem the crisis where they</text>
  <text start="536.49" dur="3.06">started to blame all those people that</text>
  <text start="537.87" dur="3.69">took out the mortgages it&amp;#39;s their fault</text>
  <text start="539.55" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re the ones who you know should</text>
  <text start="541.56" dur="3.96">have never taken out the mortgage well</text>
  <text start="543" dur="4.23">remember the banks the mortgage</text>
  <text start="545.52" dur="3.9">companies they&amp;#39;re the ones who had to</text>
  <text start="547.23" dur="3.99">approve it now if somebody goes in and</text>
  <text start="549.42" dur="4.62">said listen here&amp;#39;s my paperwork this is</text>
  <text start="551.22" dur="5.22">how much I&amp;#39;m making here&amp;#39;s my credit the</text>
  <text start="554.04" dur="4.41">bank makes the decision on who is</text>
  <text start="556.44" dur="4.11">accepted and who&amp;#39;s not accepted and when</text>
  <text start="558.45" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;re accepting all subprime people and</text>
  <text start="560.55" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;re not even looking anything at</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="4.88">anything it&amp;#39;s not the people&amp;#39;s fault but</text>
  <text start="564.99" dur="5.67">if we think back to that time period</text>
  <text start="567.08" dur="6.58">they blamed the people for the problem</text>
  <text start="570.66" dur="4.679">well guess what we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="573.66" dur="5.1">the same thing happen once again the</text>
  <text start="575.339" dur="5.971">blame game has started again and the Fed</text>
  <text start="578.76" dur="5.12">right now is accusing consumers of being</text>
  <text start="581.31" dur="5.76">stingy you&amp;#39;re not spending your money</text>
  <text start="583.88" dur="6.24">Robert samisen says the real drag in the</text>
  <text start="587.07" dur="6.8">US economy is the American people</text>
  <text start="590.12" dur="7.45">they&amp;#39;re refusing to go out and buy stuff</text>

  <text start="642.75" dur="6.3">laid off left and right I mean think</text>
  <text start="646.649" dur="6.451">about the number of layoffs that we have</text>
