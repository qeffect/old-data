  <text start="131.55" dur="5.13">speak about and there&amp;#39;s an NYU professor</text>
  <text start="134.24" dur="5.14">who launched a Twitter war against the</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="4.77">growing trend of universities coddling</text>
  <text start="139.38" dur="5.97">students with safe spaces and trigger</text>
  <text start="141.45" dur="7.47">warnings and he was speaking out his</text>
  <text start="145.35" dur="6.59">name is Michael wreck ten wolde he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="5.46">professor of liberal studies in NYU and</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="5.23">he was forced to go on paid leave for</text>
  <text start="154.38" dur="6.689">the rest of the semester after his</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="5.7">Twitter account was uncovered and his</text>
  <text start="161.069" dur="5.25">Twitter account was called deplorable</text>
  <text start="162.87" dur="9">NYU professor and it was linked back to</text>
  <text start="166.319" dur="7.681">him and he talked about safe spaces and</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="6.36">trigger warnings and other aspects of</text>
  <text start="174" dur="5.78">academia growing PC culture and how he</text>
  <text start="178.23" dur="5.27">was against this and how</text>
  <text start="179.78" dur="7.5">he said it&amp;#39;s kind of ridiculous to do</text>
  <text start="183.5" dur="7.59">this to our students and we can see</text>
  <text start="187.28" dur="6.48">today that the establishment they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="6.229">want him speaking freely about this now</text>
  <text start="193.76" dur="5.57">in the past back in the 60s or so I</text>
  <text start="197.319" dur="4.601">don&amp;#39;t think they would have a problem</text>
  <text start="199.33" dur="5.05">but today it seems like they point</text>
  <text start="201.92" dur="5.49">people out I know professor James Tracy</text>
  <text start="204.38" dur="4.89">was also cold out for questioning Sandy</text>
  <text start="207.41" dur="5.91">Hook the shooting that occurred there</text>
  <text start="209.27" dur="6.81">and we&amp;#39;re seeing this quite a bit and he</text>
  <text start="213.32" dur="5.61">says this is like a salem witch trial</text>
  <text start="216.08" dur="4.86">they took my views personally I never</text>
  <text start="218.93" dur="5.01">even mentioned that I was even</text>
  <text start="220.94" dur="6.51">associated with NYU that I was a</text>
  <text start="223.94" dur="6.36">professor there and he was talking about</text>
  <text start="227.45" dur="5.34">academia at large but we can see that</text>
  <text start="230.3" dur="5.58">the establishment they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="232.79" dur="7.74">talking about certain things they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.88" dur="7.5">want people interrupting their narrative</text>
  <text start="240.53" dur="6.179">of the entire story that you need to be</text>
  <text start="243.38" dur="5.97">politically correct that you need to be</text>
  <text start="246.709" dur="5.401">afraid that there&amp;#39;s such thing as safe</text>
  <text start="249.35" dur="5.1">places and trigger warnings and free</text>
  <text start="252.11" dur="5.07">speech zones because remember what</text>
  <text start="254.45" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re educating our</text>
  <text start="257.18" dur="7.44">children for what comes next and what</text>
  <text start="261.32" dur="4.92">comes next is the removal of the</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="3.75">Constitution and the rights of the</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="4.59">people and this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="268.37" dur="4.35">this and if they can&amp;#39;t get that they</text>
  <text start="270.83" dur="6.33">want all of this in place to make people</text>
  <text start="272.72" dur="6.59">believe that you need to be afraid you</text>
  <text start="277.16" dur="5.22">need the government to take care of you</text>
  <text start="279.31" dur="6.01">you can&amp;#39;t speak freely about certain</text>
  <text start="282.38" dur="4.98">things and they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for</text>
  <text start="285.32" dur="5.219">quite a while and we see we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="5.82">to the point where they&amp;#39;re not letting</text>
  <text start="290.539" dur="5.521">anyone talk about it whatsoever and if</text>
  <text start="293.18" dur="7.02">you try to question the establishment</text>
  <text start="296.06" dur="7.669">they remove you and we can see why this</text>
  <text start="300.2" dur="9.469">is happening because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="303.729" dur="9.091">squash any of these type of voices and</text>
  <text start="309.669" dur="6.421">again this is censoring</text>
  <text start="312.82" dur="5.94">again this is controlled speech this is</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="4.71">permitted speech and we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="318.76" dur="4.65">happen right in front of her eyes and</text>
  <text start="320.8" dur="4.38">this is how you close down a society we</text>
  <text start="323.41" dur="5.34">mentioned this and we went over it many</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="6.12">many times and they&amp;#39;re doing it every</text>
  <text start="328.75" dur="4.26">single day and of course when people</text>
  <text start="331.3" dur="2.94">look back in time you&amp;#39;ll be able to see</text>
  <text start="333.01" dur="3.93">the entire picture and say oh my god</text>
  <text start="334.24" dur="4.77">this is how it happened why didn&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="336.94" dur="4.34">realize it well we do realize it we</text>
  <text start="339.01" dur="4.88">understand that it&amp;#39;s going on right now</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="5.59">but it&amp;#39;s very hard to convince people</text>
  <text start="343.89" dur="4.72">because people don&amp;#39;t see it because</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re in the middle of it you have to</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="5.49">step back and take a wider view of</text>
  <text start="350.8" dur="5.85">what&amp;#39;s really going on out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="4.14">see the people out there well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="356.65" dur="3.39">starting to realize that coup d&amp;#39;etat</text>
  <text start="358.24" dur="3.69">that the United States had in their</text>
  <text start="360.04" dur="5.52">country well it really didn&amp;#39;t work out</text>
  <text start="361.93" dur="8.46">for them and they had this law that was</text>
  <text start="365.56" dur="7.37">passed where the politicians how to</text>
  <text start="370.39" dur="5.54">reveal how much they actually have and</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="5.65">it was their anti-corruption reform</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="6.25">requiring you senior Ukrainian officials</text>
  <text start="378.58" dur="5.39">to declare their wealth online now the</text>
  <text start="382.18" dur="4.74">population is looking at this and</text>
  <text start="383.97" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re starting to realize that these</text>
  <text start="386.92" dur="4.53">politicians are worth millions of</text>
  <text start="388.84" dur="5.57">dollars they declared millions of</text>
  <text start="391.45" dur="6.6">dollars in cash fleets of luxury cars</text>
  <text start="394.41" dur="8.71">expensive switch watches diamond jewelry</text>
  <text start="398.05" dur="6.99">large tracts of land and for most of the</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="3.54">people in Ukraine whether salaries just</text>
  <text start="405.04" dur="3.93">over two hundred dollars a month they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="412.99" dur="8.49">oligarchs yes you are the coup d&amp;#39;etat</text>
  <text start="417.96" dur="5.89">made everything worse in Ukraine think</text>
  <text start="421.48" dur="3.84">about what happened there the United</text>
  <text start="423.85" dur="4.07">States came in spent five billion</text>
  <text start="425.32" dur="7.88">dollars to overthrow the elected leader</text>
  <text start="427.92" dur="8.11">once they did this the entire country</text>
  <text start="433.2" dur="6.18">went into a huge amount of debt their</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="6.48">gold was stolen by the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="439.38" dur="6.64">we had pieces of the country broken away</text>
  <text start="442.51" dur="4.29">from broke away from Kiev because they</text>
  <text start="446.02" dur="2.639">didn&amp;#39;t want to be poor</text>
  <text start="446.8" dur="4.709">of this new puppet regime the</text>
  <text start="448.659" dur="5.401">southeastern people decided they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="451.509" dur="6.66">want to be part of it a war started in</text>
  <text start="454.06" dur="8.31">the country and the value of their</text>
  <text start="458.169" dur="7.101">currency continually declined and the</text>
  <text start="462.37" dur="6.329">whole entire economic model</text>
  <text start="465.27" dur="7.78">disintegrated so today with the United</text>
  <text start="468.699" dur="8.22">States having this coup d&amp;#39;etat having</text>
  <text start="473.05" dur="9.14">regime change again did not work the</text>
  <text start="476.919" dur="9.18">people in Sudan Libya Yemen Lebanon Iraq</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="7.08">they all understand this their countries</text>
  <text start="486.099" dur="6.03">are always at war their economies are</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="6.34">declining there in a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="492.129" dur="5.701">and it&amp;#39;s not improving whatsoever</text>
  <text start="495.61" dur="5.459">actually it is getting worse and every</text>
  <text start="497.83" dur="5.519">country the United States goes in has</text>
  <text start="501.069" dur="4.951">regime change we see the same exact</text>
  <text start="503.349" dur="5.04">pattern we see the US Treasury</text>
  <text start="506.02" dur="4.44">Department announced that us acting</text>
  <text start="508.389" dur="4.861">undersecretary for terrorism and</text>
  <text start="510.46" dur="4.47">financial intelligence Adam zubin well</text>
  <text start="513.25" dur="4.2">he&amp;#39;s heading to Europe to give us the</text>
  <text start="514.93" dur="5.34">Europeans we need to keep the sanctions</text>
  <text start="517.45" dur="4.17">on Russia because we know a lot of the</text>
  <text start="520.27" dur="3.629">European countries are saying you know</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="4.279">something maybe we should remove these</text>
  <text start="523.899" dur="4.141">sanctions it&amp;#39;s not helping our economy</text>
  <text start="525.899" dur="3.911">it&amp;#39;s not helping our relations with</text>
  <text start="528.04" dur="5.46">Russia but the United States is</text>
  <text start="529.81" dur="5.79">continually forcing them to keep these</text>
  <text start="533.5" dur="4.26">sanctions alive and what they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="535.6" dur="4.25">there saying is listen we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="537.76" dur="4.59">keep these sanctions until Russia</text>
  <text start="539.85" dur="4.479">fulfills the provisions of the Minsk</text>
  <text start="542.35" dur="4.26">agreement well Russia was the one that</text>
  <text start="544.329" dur="4.831">created the Minsk agreement Russia was</text>
  <text start="546.61" dur="6.719">the one trying to get Kiev to fulfill</text>
  <text start="549.16" dur="6.929">its part and guess what Kiev is under</text>
  <text start="553.329" dur="4.741">orders never to fill fulfill that part</text>
  <text start="556.089" dur="4.291">of the Minsk agreement so this agreement</text>
  <text start="558.07" dur="4.079">can never go anywhere and they can</text>
  <text start="560.38" dur="3.92">continually say this because it sounds</text>
  <text start="562.149" dur="5.521">great on the corporate media and through</text>
  <text start="564.3" dur="5.529">all the political network saying you</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="4.44">must fulfill the Minsk agreement when</text>
  <text start="569.829" dur="4.231">they absolutely no this is completely</text>
  <text start="572.11" dur="5.82">impossible so this way they can keep the</text>
  <text start="574.06" dur="6.99">sanctions on Russia we see out in</text>
  <text start="577.93" dur="6.69">Britain there are</text>
  <text start="581.05" dur="6.87">drone operator job ads that are being</text>
  <text start="584.62" dur="6.51">run out in that area and they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="587.92" dur="8.25">for operators for to fly kill missions</text>
  <text start="591.13" dur="8.85">from the UK soil and we can see right</text>
  <text start="596.17" dur="8.25">now that there&amp;#39;s an NGO humanitarian NGO</text>
  <text start="599.98" dur="6.9">saying that yes this is true that the UK</text>
  <text start="604.42" dur="5.03">may be willingly hosting operations</text>
  <text start="606.88" dur="7.079">which breach international law now if</text>
  <text start="609.45" dur="6.42">this is true and the claims are true we</text>
  <text start="613.959" dur="4.62">can see we have a major problem here</text>
  <text start="615.87" dur="4.54">that the UK is allowing the United</text>
  <text start="618.579" dur="5.211">States to do this and this is</text>
  <text start="620.41" dur="6.72">specifically to kill individuals and</text>
  <text start="623.79" dur="5.02">what the jobs are the jobs that are</text>
  <text start="627.13" dur="3.329">being advertised right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="628.81" dur="3.029">looking for candidates that can perform</text>
  <text start="630.459" dur="6.721">a variety of advanced targeting</text>
  <text start="631.839" dur="8.101">operations in support of GPS guided</text>
  <text start="637.18" dur="5.099">weapons weapon earring and collateral</text>
  <text start="639.94" dur="6.33">estimation as well as utilizing the</text>
  <text start="642.279" dur="6.06">tools required for advanced targeting so</text>
  <text start="646.27" dur="3.48">we can see right now in all of those</text>
  <text start="648.339" dur="4.231">countries throughout the Middle East</text>
  <text start="649.75" dur="4.579">that are against the puppet government</text>
  <text start="652.57" dur="4.38">that the United States put into power</text>
  <text start="654.329" dur="5.741">those people are called terrorists al</text>
  <text start="656.95" dur="4.59">Qaeda they use the drones on civilians</text>
  <text start="660.07" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s why you hear so many civilians</text>
  <text start="661.54" dur="4.62">being killed because that&amp;#39;s who they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="663.67" dur="4.08">really killing yes they throw in the</text>
  <text start="666.16" dur="3.6">words al Qaeda but you have to remember</text>
  <text start="667.75" dur="3.54">al Qaeda is really the terrorist group</text>
  <text start="669.76" dur="3.93">that United States government central</text>
  <text start="671.29" dur="3.96">bankers support al Qaeda when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="673.69" dur="3.75">talking about a country that was already</text>
  <text start="675.25" dur="3.63">overthrown those are the civilians the</text>
  <text start="677.44" dur="4.83">people that don&amp;#39;t want the puppet</text>
  <text start="678.88" dur="7.17">government in power like in Libya for</text>
  <text start="682.27" dur="7.2">instance John Kerry is out there trying</text>
  <text start="686.05" dur="6.56">to convince France Italy Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="689.47" dur="7.35">the United Arab Emirates United Kingdom</text>
  <text start="692.61" dur="6.96">to join together and give their full</text>
  <text start="696.82" dur="4.92">support to the unity government in Libya</text>
  <text start="699.57" dur="6.37">now the people didn&amp;#39;t vote for this</text>
  <text start="701.74" dur="6.839">government and this is not a government</text>
  <text start="705.94" dur="4.62">that people want so all those people who</text>
  <text start="708.579" dur="5.461">are against the unity government they</text>
  <text start="710.56" dur="3.76">will eventually be called al Qaeda they</text>
  <text start="714.04" dur="2.71">will</text>
  <text start="714.32" dur="3.66">be bombed they will be drone but right</text>
  <text start="716.75" dur="5.67">now we know the United States government</text>
  <text start="717.98" dur="8.07">is in Libya actually bombing those</text>
  <text start="722.42" dur="6.44">civilians who are against having this</text>

  <text start="779" dur="8.43">ready to defend Syria from what the</text>
  <text start="784.07" dur="5.34">United States is about to do and what</text>
  <text start="787.43" dur="3.78">are they about to do most likely they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="789.41" dur="3.87">going to have a major offensive because</text>
  <text start="791.21" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re coming up to this point where the</text>
  <text start="793.28" dur="5.07">United States they&amp;#39;re using every lie</text>
  <text start="796.01" dur="4.92">every piece of propaganda to convince</text>
  <text start="798.35" dur="5.1">the world that Assad needs to be removed</text>
  <text start="800.93" dur="4.95">right now that Russia needs to be thrown</text>
  <text start="803.45" dur="4.11">out of Syria because this is the only</text>
  <text start="805.88" dur="3.99">way they&amp;#39;re going to be able to remove</text>
  <text start="807.56" dur="3.81">Assad they need to get rid of Russia and</text>
  <text start="809.87" dur="5.25">this is why you see all the propaganda</text>
  <text start="811.37" dur="6.75">coming up about Russia about Russia</text>
  <text start="815.12" dur="6.53">bombing Aleppo about Russia keeping the</text>
  <text start="818.12" dur="7.08">humanitarian aid from coming into Aleppo</text>
  <text start="821.65" dur="6.75">they have another one where Syria is</text>
  <text start="825.2" dur="6.12">using starvation as a weapon of war</text>
  <text start="828.4" dur="5.92">they&amp;#39;re not allowing the humanitarian</text>
  <text start="831.32" dur="5.13">aid in so they&amp;#39;re starving their people</text>
  <text start="834.32" dur="4.62">it is a war crime under the Geneva</text>
  <text start="836.45" dur="5.16">Convention and this is computer</text>
  <text start="838.94" dur="4.26">propaganda and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="841.61" dur="2.91">Russia is saying this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="843.2" dur="4.889">ridiculous we have all these corridors</text>
  <text start="844.52" dur="6.509">open and we have evidence</text>
  <text start="848.089" dur="4.92">that yes the terrorists are preventing</text>
  <text start="851.029" dur="4.92">people from getting the humanitarian aid</text>
  <text start="853.009" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re killing people if they tried to</text>
  <text start="855.949" dur="6.171">leave and they&amp;#39;re holding people back</text>
  <text start="858.199" dur="8.7">and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="862.12" dur="6.699">propaganda but we see right now Russia</text>
  <text start="866.899" dur="3.62">understands what the United States</text>
  <text start="868.819" dur="5.01">government central bankers are up to</text>
  <text start="870.519" dur="5.351">they understand that they&amp;#39;re moving the</text>
  <text start="873.829" dur="4.23">terrorist groups from a soul to Iraq</text>
  <text start="875.87" dur="5.85">than to Aleppo because Sergei Lavrov is</text>
  <text start="878.059" dur="5.7">out there saying we realize that these</text>
  <text start="881.72" dur="4.369">terrorists are on the move from Iraq and</text>
  <text start="883.759" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re heading into the Aleppo area and</text>
  <text start="886.089" dur="6.04">we can see right now that he says Russia</text>
  <text start="888.889" dur="5.01">and Syria well they&amp;#39;re not going to let</text>
  <text start="892.129" dur="4.2">this happen they&amp;#39;re going to stop them</text>
  <text start="893.899" dur="4.531">before they get to Aleppo so they</text>
  <text start="896.329" dur="3.271">already understand what the United</text>
  <text start="898.43" dur="4.79">States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="899.6" dur="6.089">tactics are and they&amp;#39;re pointing it out</text>
  <text start="903.22" dur="5.289">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="905.689" dur="5.671">United States as they are propaganda</text>
  <text start="908.509" dur="6.361">their lies die off because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="911.36" dur="7.079">really make a case because Russia</text>
  <text start="914.87" dur="6.36">contacted the UN and they&amp;#39;re presenting</text>
  <text start="918.439" dur="6.57">evidence that yes it is the terrorists</text>
  <text start="921.23" dur="7.829">that are stopping all the humanitarian</text>
  <text start="925.009" dur="7.37">aid from reaching the civilians and we</text>
  <text start="929.059" dur="7.26">can see right now that Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="932.379" dur="6.64">they are ready to remove the Islamic</text>
  <text start="936.319" dur="4.981">state from that country and get rid of</text>
  <text start="939.019" dur="4.74">all terrorists this is why Russia is</text>
  <text start="941.3" dur="4.199">building up their military presence in</text>
  <text start="943.759" dur="4.92">the Mediterranean they&amp;#39;re bringing in</text>
  <text start="945.499" dur="6.861">military assets because the United</text>
  <text start="948.679" dur="7.89">States at this point has three options</text>
  <text start="952.36" dur="6.849">one tell the truth tell everyone was</text>
  <text start="956.569" dur="5.43">what what has happened here and let the</text>
  <text start="959.209" dur="5.401">economy fail and of course when that</text>
  <text start="961.999" dur="3.9">happens people will get rid of the</text>
  <text start="964.61" dur="3.99">government they will get rid of the</text>
  <text start="965.899" dur="4.68">central bank so we know that options are</text>
  <text start="968.6" dur="6.32">really not going to happen the second</text>
  <text start="970.579" dur="9.63">option leave Syria leave the Middle East</text>
  <text start="974.92" dur="6.399">let the entire economy collapse with no</text>
  <text start="980.209" dur="4.211">war</text>
  <text start="981.319" dur="5.38">again people are going to point the</text>
  <text start="984.42" dur="4.079">fingers at the central bank at the US</text>
  <text start="986.699" dur="3.24">government because they&amp;#39;ve been lying to</text>
  <text start="988.499" dur="3.69">us all this time telling us that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="989.939" dur="8.19">in recovery how would they explain it</text>
  <text start="992.189" dur="9.51">the third option begin a war go full</text>
  <text start="998.129" dur="7.861">force to cover up the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="1001.699" dur="9.421">and we can see right now that if Russia</text>
  <text start="1005.99" dur="9.509">and Syria remove the terrorists from</text>
  <text start="1011.12" dur="7.889">Syria there is no reason for the United</text>
  <text start="1015.499" dur="7.59">States to be in Syria when this happens</text>
  <text start="1019.009" dur="6.631">if it does the entire system will start</text>
  <text start="1023.089" dur="6.151">to unravel and this is why I think at</text>
  <text start="1025.64" dur="5.639">this point the u.s. is going to pick the</text>
  <text start="1029.24" dur="3.569">third option and when I say the u.s. I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1031.279" dur="3.571">talking about the central bank&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1032.809" dur="4.02">neocons now it all depends on this</text>
  <text start="1034.85" dur="2.849">election of when it&amp;#39;s going to happen I</text>
  <text start="1036.829" dur="5.281">think it&amp;#39;s going to happen no matter</text>
  <text start="1037.699" dur="8.431">what but the time frame is going to be</text>
  <text start="1042.11" dur="6.36">adjusted depending on who wins and we</text>
  <text start="1046.13" dur="3.75">can see that they are preparing for this</text>
  <text start="1048.47" dur="3.72">turkey right now is sending</text>
  <text start="1049.88" dur="5.64">reinforcements to the Syrian border we</text>
  <text start="1052.19" dur="7.44">have travel advisories for families to</text>
  <text start="1055.52" dur="6.149">remove themselves from Turkey and we can</text>
  <text start="1059.63" dur="5.46">see that the reinforcements include</text>
  <text start="1061.669" dur="5.88">tanks vehicles other military assets and</text>
  <text start="1065.09" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re bringing them all up to the</text>
  <text start="1067.549" dur="5.971">border of Syria because they know at</text>
  <text start="1070.22" dur="5.79">this point their backs are against the</text>
  <text start="1073.52" dur="6.899">wall and we&amp;#39;re heading into a period of</text>
  <text start="1076.01" dur="5.88">time where all of this all of this</text>
  <text start="1080.419" dur="3">together because everything is connected</text>
  <text start="1081.89" dur="3">i know everyone believes like Oh what</text>
  <text start="1083.419" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s happening in the Middle East is not</text>
  <text start="1084.89" dur="3.539">connected to the economy but everything</text>
  <text start="1086.809" dur="4.47">is connected because the petro dollar is</text>
  <text start="1088.429" dur="5.041">the center of everything right now that</text>
  <text start="1091.279" dur="5.01">has to do with the economy if the petro</text>
  <text start="1093.47" dur="7.35">dollar ceases to exist this economy</text>
  <text start="1096.289" dur="6.541">crashes in about two seconds and they</text>
  <text start="1100.82" dur="3.69">know this so all of this that we see</text>
  <text start="1102.83" dur="5.42">happening around the world it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1104.51" dur="6.18">interconnected and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1108.25" dur="4.51">they&amp;#39;re not going to just give up their</text>
  <text start="1110.69" dur="3.84">system they love the power they love the</text>
  <text start="1112.76" dur="3.69">control</text>
  <text start="1114.53" dur="5.43">and this is why we&amp;#39;re going to see an</text>
  <text start="1116.45" dur="5.54">event of all events occur I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1119.96" dur="5.52">getting closer and closer to that point</text>
  <text start="1121.99" dur="7.06">you know they&amp;#39;re going to be pulling the</text>
  <text start="1125.48" dur="7.29">trigger you know they have to because</text>
  <text start="1129.05" dur="6.33">they have no way out of this would it be</text>
  <text start="1132.77" dur="4.32">better if the system just collapses and</text>
  <text start="1135.38" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s no war yes it would be better</text>
  <text start="1137.09" dur="6.12">for the people but for them it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1140.39" dur="5.25">good for them because people are going</text>
  <text start="1143.21" dur="3.96">to take them throw them in jail people</text>
  <text start="1145.64" dur="3.66">are going to take them and say never</text>
  <text start="1147.17" dur="5.88">again the central bank will cease to</text>
  <text start="1149.3" dur="5.97">exist and they know this is what is</text>
  <text start="1153.05" dur="4.89">going to happen so they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1155.27" dur="5.82">continually lie cover up until the very</text>
  <text start="1157.94" dur="6.36">end and again they don&amp;#39;t care if we go</text>
  <text start="1161.09" dur="5.69">to war they don&amp;#39;t care if they bring the</text>
  <text start="1164.3" dur="4.56">country to war because they do believe</text>
  <text start="1166.78" dur="6.1">from everything that they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="1168.86" dur="6.42">they can win it they&amp;#39;ll go underground</text>
  <text start="1172.88" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;ll let everyone else fight and they</text>
  <text start="1175.28" dur="6.09">do believe that when they are victorious</text>
  <text start="1178.19" dur="5.97">they will re-emerge transition the</text>
  <text start="1181.37" dur="5.19">system get rid of the rights of the</text>
  <text start="1184.16" dur="7.83">people and start this nightmare all over</text>
  <text start="1186.56" dur="7.59">again and this is why at this point the</text>
  <text start="1191.99" dur="5.55">people have to come together and start</text>
  <text start="1194.15" dur="4.89">to realize what is happening and we see</text>
  <text start="1197.54" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re getting closer and closer to that</text>
  <text start="1199.04" dur="5.79">time period we see more and more people</text>
  <text start="1201.68" dur="5.73">are waking up but we need to spread the</text>
