  <text start="106.54" dur="3.57">is happening now in the beginning they</text>
  <text start="108.13" dur="3.96">use the brexit and of course they were</text>
  <text start="110.11" dur="4.11">able to use the brexit to bail out some</text>
  <text start="112.09" dur="3.9">of the italian banks and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="114.22" dur="3.33">it to blame on why this is happening in</text>

  <text start="119.56" dur="4.56">been following what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="120.549" dur="6.991">documenting it this is why this is being</text>
  <text start="124.12" dur="7.229">done this is why we do this every single</text>
  <text start="127.54" dur="5.699">day to show that this just didn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="131.349" dur="3.211">out of left field this has been</text>
  <text start="133.239" dur="5.241">something that&amp;#39;s been happening all</text>
  <text start="134.56" dur="7.59">along and we can see right now that as</text>
  <text start="138.48" dur="5.5">we move forward this entire economic</text>
  <text start="142.15" dur="6">system that we&amp;#39;re in the global economy</text>
  <text start="143.98" dur="7.53">is just going to get worse and worse now</text>
  <text start="148.15" dur="6.059">we can see out in the u.s. the situation</text>
  <text start="151.51" dur="6.02">is getting worse and worse since Obama</text>
  <text start="154.209" dur="6.75">took office in 2008 we see there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="6.55">eighty-three thousand fewer coal jobs</text>
  <text start="160.959" dur="7.111">and four hundred coal mines that</text>
  <text start="164.08" dur="5.97">didn&amp;#39;t make it now of course we know</text>
  <text start="168.07" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s a lot of regulations we know</text>
  <text start="170.05" dur="7.01">they&amp;#39;re using global warming but we can</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="8.49">see right now that the entire system is</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="7.18">collapsing under too much government</text>
  <text start="180.94" dur="6.27">regulation it&amp;#39;s collapsing under this</text>
  <text start="184.24" dur="5.79">fake global warming where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="187.21" dur="6.39">eventually going to try to impose a tax</text>
  <text start="190.03" dur="6.48">on the people a carbon footprint this is</text>
  <text start="193.6" dur="5.4">the end goal to all of this it&amp;#39;s not to</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="6.32">save the environment it&amp;#39;s not to do</text>
  <text start="199" dur="6.959">anything but to stuff their pockets with</text>
  <text start="202.83" dur="7.06">more money from the people that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="205.959" dur="8.221">that&amp;#39;s what this is all about it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="209.89" dur="8.13">about keeping their system alive keeping</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="8.13">the people tied into the system keeping</text>
  <text start="218.02" dur="6.15">the debt controlled because the central</text>
  <text start="222.31" dur="4.5">bankers they don&amp;#39;t want to put a country</text>
  <text start="224.17" dur="4.2">too far into debt because then the world</text>
  <text start="226.81" dur="4.77">looks at it and says you just collapsed</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="4.89">a country they don&amp;#39;t want the country</text>
  <text start="231.58" dur="4.02">not to be in debt because then they</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="4.979">can&amp;#39;t control the country they need to</text>
  <text start="235.6" dur="4.23">have that fine line and this is what</text>
  <text start="238.239" dur="6.241">we&amp;#39;re seeing so they need the people</text>
  <text start="239.83" dur="6">right now to keep the debt at a certain</text>
  <text start="244.48" dur="3.81">level this is why they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="245.83" dur="6.36">a wealth tax this is why they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="248.29" dur="6.09">about a carbon tax and we can see as we</text>
  <text start="252.19" dur="3.75">move into the future right now we can</text>
  <text start="254.38" dur="3">get a glimpse of what is happening I</text>
  <text start="255.94" dur="3.69">mean we just need to look at different</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="3.92">countries we look at Venezuela we look</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="4.17">at Brazil but look at Greece we look at</text>
  <text start="261.3" dur="5.47">Cypress we look throughout the European</text>
  <text start="263.8" dur="5.82">Union we see what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="7.34">hanjin and we talked about this before</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="7.98">how this entire shipping system</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="5.68">completely collapsed now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="277.6" dur="6.21">interesting about this is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.79" dur="6.24">closing the ports and not allowing these</text>
  <text start="283.81" dur="5.01">ships into certain areas so a lot of</text>
  <text start="286.03" dur="7.11">these vessels they&amp;#39;re just out at sea</text>
  <text start="288.82" dur="6.599">and they&amp;#39;re stranded at sea for weeks or</text>
  <text start="293.14" dur="4.08">might even be longer and you have to</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="2.491">remember there&amp;#39;s crews aboard these</text>
  <text start="297.22" dur="4.38">ships</text>
  <text start="297.91" dur="7.38">15 to 25 sailors now they have food and</text>
  <text start="301.6" dur="8">water for a couple of weeks but anything</text>
  <text start="305.29" dur="7.77">beyond this they&amp;#39;re in real trouble and</text>
  <text start="309.6" dur="7.57">what they&amp;#39;re saying is there is no more</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="6.51">credit for this shipping company now we</text>
  <text start="317.17" dur="6.93">talked about this before when this</text>
  <text start="319.57" dur="9.09">system implode &amp;#39;he&amp;#39;s credit is going to</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="7.29">freeze up which means deliveries will</text>
  <text start="328.66" dur="5.82">freeze will freeze up because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.39" dur="6">seeing with hanjin is they can only go</text>
  <text start="334.48" dur="6.06">and sail into a port if they pay the</text>
  <text start="337.39" dur="5.67">fees in cash it&amp;#39;s going to it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="340.54" dur="6.48">be the same exact thing when the entire</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="7.53">global network comes crashing down when</text>
  <text start="347.02" dur="7.2">credit freezes up when we have this</text>
  <text start="350.59" dur="7.2">collapse and credit freezes there will</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="6.99">be no deliveries unless it&amp;#39;s paid in</text>
  <text start="357.79" dur="6.15">cash because credit will not be</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="4.98">available at the time and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="363.94" dur="4.38">a glimpse into the future right now of</text>
  <text start="366.19" dur="3.93">what is going to happen and this is why</text>
  <text start="368.32" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re talking about deliveries being</text>
  <text start="370.12" dur="5.03">delayed for weeks or months at this</text>
  <text start="373" dur="5.669">point think about the trucking industry</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="7.92">thinking about the rail traffic think</text>
  <text start="378.669" dur="9.721">about all the other shipping companies</text>
  <text start="383.07" dur="8.38">when this system implode and credit</text>
  <text start="388.39" dur="6.75">freezes up we&amp;#39;re going to have a major</text>
  <text start="391.45" dur="6.9">problem people are not going to be able</text>
  <text start="395.14" dur="5.01">to get their supplies people are going</text>
  <text start="398.35" dur="4.2">to go to the store they&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="400.15" dur="5.07">the shells completely bare and empty</text>
  <text start="402.55" dur="5.85">they will not be able to get what they</text>
  <text start="405.22" dur="5.94">need cash won&amp;#39;t help you Gold won&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="408.4" dur="4.62">you silver won&amp;#39;t help you the only thing</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="5.66">that will help you is to have your only</text>
  <text start="413.02" dur="6.42">own store of food water medical supplies</text>
  <text start="416.82" dur="5.83">toiletries a weapon to protect yourself</text>
  <text start="419.44" dur="5.28">and yes you do need the cash and the</text>
  <text start="422.65" dur="5.22">goal because these will come into play</text>
  <text start="424.72" dur="4.83">at certain points now we&amp;#39;re going to run</text>
  <text start="427.87" dur="3.659">out with your gold and silver and say</text>
  <text start="429.55" dur="3.629">hey I want to buy some toilet paper no</text>
  <text start="431.529" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;re going to use your cash first this</text>
  <text start="433.179" dur="3.84">is why you need to keep cash on hand you</text>
  <text start="435.369" dur="5.49">want to get rid of the paper in the</text>
  <text start="437.019" dur="7.8">beginning as the paper inflates you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="440.859" dur="7.92">use all of it up once you use it up and</text>
  <text start="444.819" dur="5.13">the system breaks down everything starts</text>
  <text start="448.779" dur="4.53">to reset your going to need your</text>
  <text start="449.949" dur="6.84">supplies you&amp;#39;re going to need your food</text>
  <text start="453.309" dur="5.48">your water and when the system resets</text>
  <text start="456.789" dur="7.2">that&amp;#39;s when the gold and the silver</text>
  <text start="458.789" dur="6.76">comes into play now we see the US</text>
  <text start="463.989" dur="4.71">Centers for Disease and Control and</text>
  <text start="465.549" dur="6.72">Prevention they have completely</text>
  <text start="468.699" dur="9.6">overstepped their authority in proposing</text>
  <text start="472.269" dur="9.38">to grant itself the power to go above</text>
  <text start="478.299" dur="7.26">and beyond the rights of the people and</text>
  <text start="481.649" dur="7.95">what I&amp;#39;m talking about is this new</text>
  <text start="485.559" dur="9.9">proposed rule control of communicable</text>
  <text start="489.599" dur="8.44">diseases so on august 15 2016 the CDC</text>
  <text start="495.459" dur="6.51">will self invest itself with the power</text>
  <text start="498.039" dur="5.85">to apprehend healthy people and detain</text>
  <text start="501.969" dur="5.97">them indefinitely with no process of</text>
  <text start="503.889" dur="8.51">Appeal and this was published in the</text>
  <text start="507.939" dur="9.51">federal register number 2016 18 103 and</text>
  <text start="512.399" dur="9.49">the CDC right now wants to take those</text>
  <text start="517.449" dur="8.041">people who are contagious or maybe they</text>
  <text start="521.889" dur="8.43">think they&amp;#39;re contagious and just detain</text>
  <text start="525.49" dur="7.889">them with no process of Appeal there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.319" dur="6.301">no oversight to this whatsoever and the</text>
  <text start="533.379" dur="6.45">question we have to ask is why are they</text>
  <text start="536.62" dur="6.48">doing this at this point we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.829" dur="6.541">playing up the Zika virus we understand</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="6.239">a year ago or so they played up Ebola</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="6.959">and we know the pharmaceutical companies</text>
  <text start="549.339" dur="6.961">they&amp;#39;ve been producing vaccines and we</text>
  <text start="553.329" dur="7.98">can see they might use this in the</text>
  <text start="556.3" dur="8.49">future now out in South Sudan we see</text>
  <text start="561.309" dur="4.081">South Sudan who initially said listen we</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="3.12">do not</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="5.52">want UN peacekeepers in our country</text>
  <text start="567.91" dur="5.7">these are military troops and we do not</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="6.03">want them there now after first</text>
  <text start="573.61" dur="7.5">rejecting them they decided okay we will</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="6.45">allow 4000 of the UN peacekeepers into</text>
  <text start="581.11" dur="5.4">the country now they first rejected it</text>
  <text start="583.39" dur="4.92">and then they said okay we will allow</text>
  <text start="586.51" dur="3">this to happen and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="588.31" dur="2.55">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="589.51" dur="3.6">bankers they&amp;#39;ve been pushing for this</text>
  <text start="590.86" dur="6.45">because you have to remember going back</text>
  <text start="593.11" dur="6.09">in time where general wesley c clarke</text>
  <text start="597.31" dur="4.92">came out and said listen we&amp;#39;ll be going</text>
  <text start="599.2" dur="5.13">into Sudan will be going into Libya will</text>
  <text start="602.23" dur="5.52">be going into Yemen will be going into</text>
  <text start="604.33" dur="8.37">Iraq was Syria Iran the United States</text>
  <text start="607.75" dur="7.17">right now they&amp;#39;re losing control of what</text>
  <text start="612.7" dur="5.13">they set out to do and that was to</text>
  <text start="614.92" dur="5.19">replace all the government&amp;#39;s control the</text>
  <text start="617.83" dur="5.64">natural resources which is oil set up a</text>
  <text start="620.11" dur="6.66">private west central bank and sell the</text>
  <text start="623.47" dur="5.04">oil using the dollar and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="626.77" dur="4.89">happening right now is they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="628.51" dur="5.61">control to maintain control they need to</text>
  <text start="631.66" dur="4.8">use whatever they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="634.12" dur="4.23">control what is happening in each one of</text>
  <text start="636.46" dur="3.48">these countries and this is why the</text>
  <text start="638.35" dur="6.51">United States government they were</text>
  <text start="639.94" dur="7.5">pushing to bring in un armed troops to</text>
  <text start="644.86" dur="7.65">control the situation the u.s. is in</text>
  <text start="647.44" dur="7.62">Libya bombing in this country to allow</text>
  <text start="652.51" dur="4.05">the unity government to take control of</text>
  <text start="655.06" dur="5.22">the country even though the people</text>
  <text start="656.56" dur="6.39">object to this they don&amp;#39;t care in Iraq</text>
  <text start="660.28" dur="4.38">the same thing is happening in Syria</text>
  <text start="662.95" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re trying to remove the elected</text>
  <text start="664.66" dur="3.24">government to replace it with a puppet</text>
  <text start="666.37" dur="5.45">government because this is part of their</text>
  <text start="667.9" dur="6">mission we see us France and Germany</text>
  <text start="671.82" dur="4.75">they&amp;#39;re going to keep sanctions on</text>
  <text start="673.9" dur="8.1">Russia until the Minsk deal is fulfilled</text>
  <text start="676.57" dur="8.31">and we can see right now if Kiev is not</text>
  <text start="682" dur="6.24">going to fulfill them in steel the</text>
  <text start="684.88" dur="5.25">sanctions will never be lifted and this</text>
  <text start="688.24" dur="3.75">is a game the United States government</text>
  <text start="690.13" dur="4.77">central bankers are playing right now</text>
  <text start="691.99" dur="6.81">because they know if Kiev doesn&amp;#39;t follow</text>
  <text start="694.9" dur="5.85">through this will never happen and this</text>
  <text start="698.8" dur="4.38">why the US military they are increasing</text>
  <text start="700.75" dur="4.68">their presence in Ukraine they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="703.18" dur="5.37">bringing in more equipment more troops</text>
  <text start="705.43" dur="6.599">into this area and we&amp;#39;re getting word</text>
  <text start="708.55" dur="6.45">from certain information that was</text>
  <text start="712.029" dur="5.911">intercepted that Kiev is preparing to</text>
  <text start="715" dur="5.13">use chemical weapons in the south</text>
  <text start="717.94" dur="5.76">eastern region and this is something</text>
  <text start="720.13" dur="6.269">that we need to watch we see President</text>
  <text start="723.7" dur="5.34">Putin called for the creation of</text>

  <text start="740.29" dur="5.94">over the four islands in that area and</text>
  <text start="742.93" dur="6.08">it looks like they&amp;#39;re looking to come</text>
  <text start="746.23" dur="6.359">closer together and sign a peace treaty</text>
  <text start="749.01" dur="5.829">Obama and Putin during the g20 meetings</text>
  <text start="752.589" dur="6.361">they&amp;#39;re telling diplomats there to keep</text>
  <text start="754.839" dur="7.431">working on the Syrian agreement and we</text>
  <text start="758.95" dur="6.12">can see right now the u.s. they have</text>
  <text start="762.27" dur="6.24">preconditions for this ceasefire</text>
  <text start="765.07" dur="5.82">agreement and we&amp;#39;ve been discussing them</text>
  <text start="768.51" dur="6.46">throughout all the other reports that</text>
  <text start="770.89" dur="7.5">I&amp;#39;ve done about how Assad needs to be</text>
  <text start="774.97" dur="5.91">removed and this is one of the major</text>
  <text start="778.39" dur="4.65">sticking points the other one is that</text>
  <text start="780.88" dur="3.51">they don&amp;#39;t want Russia bombing the</text>
  <text start="783.04" dur="3.299">moderate rebels which are intertwined</text>
  <text start="784.39" dur="4.949">with terrorist groups which really it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="786.339" dur="6">one gigantic terrorist group and we can</text>
  <text start="789.339" dur="5.761">see this is the major problem and it</text>
  <text start="792.339" dur="5.49">looks like Russia is not going to budge</text>
  <text start="795.1" dur="6.03">and the u.s. is not going to budge but</text>
  <text start="797.829" dur="6.811">the u.s. right now is actually blaming</text>
  <text start="801.13" dur="6.12">turkey for the ceasefire peace talks</text>
  <text start="804.64" dur="6.02">breaking down because turkey is now in</text>
  <text start="807.25" dur="6.209">Syria launching a ground operation and</text>
  <text start="810.66" dur="4.51">they&amp;#39;re saying they are the problem at</text>
  <text start="813.459" dur="6.961">this point and you have to remember this</text>
  <text start="815.17" dur="10.32">has all been created to create chaos in</text>
  <text start="820.42" dur="7.05">the region and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="825.49" dur="4.5">all of this is being done for one</text>
  <text start="827.47" dur="5.16">purpose and one purpose only it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="829.99" dur="8.04">remove Assad now they planned on</text>
  <text start="832.63" dur="7.92">creating this no-fly zone and this is</text>
  <text start="838.03" dur="7.26">where they are headed no-fly zone</text>
  <text start="840.55" dur="7.47">exclusive zone safe zone they have many</text>
  <text start="845.29" dur="7.17">many names for it but Iran is out there</text>
  <text start="848.02" dur="7.8">and they&amp;#39;re saying that Turkey they</text>
  <text start="852.46" dur="6.8">should coordinate with Syria on what</text>
  <text start="855.82" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;re doing in their country because</text>
  <text start="859.26" dur="9.46">the Turkish government invaded a country</text>
  <text start="862.54" dur="9.03">and they didn&amp;#39;t ask permission from the</text>
  <text start="868.72" dur="6.39">central government so they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="871.57" dur="5.13">country and they&amp;#39;re waging war the</text>
  <text start="875.11" dur="3.42">United States is in a country where they</text>
  <text start="876.7" dur="7.17">didn&amp;#39;t ask permission and they&amp;#39;re waging</text>
  <text start="878.53" dur="7.74">war now turkey says they&amp;#39;ve cleaned the</text>
  <text start="883.87" dur="5.96">Islamic state away from the border of</text>
  <text start="886.27" dur="6.96">Turkey and since they accomplish this</text>
  <text start="889.83" dur="7.42">irda one is proposing a no-fly zone in</text>
  <text start="893.23" dur="6.56">northern Syria and he wants this in this</text>
  <text start="897.25" dur="5.37">area is going to call it a safe zone and</text>
  <text start="899.79" dur="5.59">he&amp;#39;s looking at Russia and the US to say</text>
  <text start="902.62" dur="5.01">this is what we need a no-fly zone in</text>
  <text start="905.38" dur="3.57">this area now we know the terrorists</text>
  <text start="907.63" dur="4.13">they&amp;#39;re not flying planes who were</text>
  <text start="908.95" dur="5.25">flying planes Russia&amp;#39;s flying a plane</text>
  <text start="911.76" dur="5.47">United States coalition forces of flying</text>
  <text start="914.2" dur="5.58">planes serious flying planes and turkey</text>
  <text start="917.23" dur="5.19">is flying planes so if they set up a</text>
  <text start="919.78" dur="7.08">no-fly zone they&amp;#39;re going to keep Russia</text>
  <text start="922.42" dur="6.51">and Syria out of that region and this is</text>
  <text start="926.86" dur="4.5">what they&amp;#39;re going to use for a forward</text>
  <text start="928.93" dur="5.22">launching pad because the error they</text>
  <text start="931.36" dur="4.71">want is right near Aleppo in the</text>
  <text start="934.15" dur="4.56">northern section now they have the</text>
  <text start="936.07" dur="5.34">access from Turkey to bring in military</text>
  <text start="938.71" dur="4.2">assets into this area and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="941.41" dur="4.29">have to watch turkey very closely</text>
  <text start="942.91" dur="5.36">because if they&amp;#39;re truly siding with</text>
  <text start="945.7" dur="5.94">Russia they will close their borders</text>
  <text start="948.27" dur="5.71">right now since they cleared out the</text>
  <text start="951.64" dur="7.17">Islamic state they can remove themselves</text>
  <text start="953.98" dur="7.44">from Syria close the borders and say see</text>
  <text start="958.81" dur="3.779">this is all we wanted to do and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="961.42" dur="4.38">gonna have to watch the situation</text>
  <text start="962.589" dur="6.571">because setting up a no-fly zone does</text>
  <text start="965.8" dur="6.84">mean you&amp;#39;re closing your borders it</text>
  <text start="969.16" dur="6.299">means you&amp;#39;re working with the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="972.64" dur="7.65">set up this area to be separate and</text>
  <text start="975.459" dur="7.891">apart from Syria now we understand going</text>
  <text start="980.29" dur="6.479">back in time about 15 years ago the US</text>
  <text start="983.35" dur="5.549">government in response to 911 they took</text>
  <text start="986.769" dur="5.551">the unprecedented step of declaring war</text>
  <text start="988.899" dur="5.761">on terror and they declared a state of</text>
  <text start="992.32" dur="5.1">national emergency onto September 14</text>
  <text start="994.66" dur="4.32">2001 this combined with the</text>
  <text start="997.42" dur="5.37">authorization for use of military force</text>
  <text start="998.98" dur="7.62">the AUMF that gave the executive branch</text>
  <text start="1002.79" dur="6.66">pictorial powers allowing the evasion</text>
  <text start="1006.6" dur="5.97">for Iraq and occupying it and many other</text>
  <text start="1009.45" dur="4.98">Middle Eastern countries and of course</text>
  <text start="1012.57" dur="4.59">by doing this they bypassed the Geneva</text>
  <text start="1014.43" dur="5.31">Convention to declare foreign fighters</text>
  <text start="1017.16" dur="6.5">as enemy combatants to be tortured and</text>
  <text start="1019.74" dur="6.599">held indefinitely now these new powers</text>
  <text start="1023.66" dur="6.549">allow the creation of a surveillance</text>
  <text start="1026.339" dur="6.031">state politicians of course claim these</text>
  <text start="1030.209" dur="3.391">powers would only be temporary and you</text>
  <text start="1032.37" dur="3.51">know whenever the government comes out</text>
  <text start="1033.6" dur="4.829">and says this is going to be temporary</text>
  <text start="1035.88" dur="6.689">it is going to be permanent because as</text>
  <text start="1038.429" dur="6.27">we can see many many years later it is</text>
  <text start="1042.569" dur="6.661">completely permanent well it looks like</text>
  <text start="1044.699" dur="6.961">Obama has extended all of this because</text>
  <text start="1049.23" dur="3.689">we&amp;#39;re still fighting terrorism now</text>
  <text start="1051.66" dur="5.82">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="1052.919" dur="8.311">this is every time the government steps</text>
  <text start="1057.48" dur="7.32">in to solve a problem that problem just</text>
  <text start="1061.23" dur="8.97">gets worse because we had a terrorism</text>
  <text start="1064.8" dur="7.23">problem back 15 years ago and it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="1070.2" dur="5.88">of a problem today it&amp;#39;s gotten worse</text>
  <text start="1072.03" dur="6.72">just like the war on drugs because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1076.08" dur="4.229">all created by the government and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1078.75" dur="5.1">going to get worse because this is what</text>
  <text start="1080.309" dur="6.181">they want to show you you we need to</text>
  <text start="1083.85" dur="6.66">take away more rights we need more power</text>
  <text start="1086.49" dur="6.84">you need less and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="1090.51" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;ve been doing so we can see right</text>
  <text start="1093.33" dur="6.33">now they&amp;#39;re extending this and the</text>
  <text start="1096.66" dur="6.57">government is never going to give up</text>
  <text start="1099.66" dur="7.47">the power once the government receives</text>
  <text start="1103.23" dur="5.94">the power they never give it up they</text>
  <text start="1107.13" dur="4.23">want the power to do whatever they want</text>
  <text start="1109.17" dur="4.55">they don&amp;#39;t want to be old Congress they</text>
  <text start="1111.36" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t want to deal with the people and</text>
  <text start="1113.72" dur="5.41">we can see this is completely evident</text>
  <text start="1116.43" dur="6.69">from what they&amp;#39;ve been doing it is</text>
  <text start="1119.13" dur="5.79">becoming a dictatorship listen everyone</text>
