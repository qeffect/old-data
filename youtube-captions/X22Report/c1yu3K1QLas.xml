  <text start="202.75" dur="5.61">political and geopolitical news now the</text>
  <text start="205.75" dur="5.7">deep state the swamp they are fighting</text>
  <text start="208.36" dur="5.67">back any way they possibly can and of</text>
  <text start="211.45" dur="5.1">course Ford came forward first and</text>
  <text start="214.03" dur="4.26">Feinstein held on to the letter didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="216.55" dur="4.2">release it to the final moments I mean</text>
  <text start="218.29" dur="5.34">she got this back in July when the</text>
  <text start="220.75" dur="5.61">letter was actually written and she had</text>
  <text start="223.63" dur="5.15">access to it but she held on to it and</text>
  <text start="226.36" dur="5.31">there was a reason why she did this</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="5.53">because they didn&amp;#39;t want an</text>
  <text start="231.67" dur="5.19">investigation at that time because it</text>
  <text start="234.31" dur="4.53">would then be over with and Cavanaugh</text>
  <text start="236.86" dur="4.23">would then be confirmed they know this</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="5.61">they waited for the last minute to</text>
  <text start="241.09" dur="5.46">postpone the confirmation and what they</text>
  <text start="244.45" dur="3.66">realized is that they weren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="246.55" dur="3.71">postpone the confirmation so what they</text>
  <text start="248.11" dur="5.31">started to do was they started to throw</text>
  <text start="250.26" dur="4.93">more women at Kavanagh I mean some of</text>
  <text start="253.42" dur="4.23">them are absolutely ridiculous I mean</text>
  <text start="255.19" dur="5.93">let the latest one is sweat Knicks and</text>
  <text start="257.65" dur="9.23">of course her lawyer Michael a vanetti</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="8.74">he&amp;#39;s using this with no proof with</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="5.83">nothing to show that he was even around</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="5.87">and now we&amp;#39;re getting reports that sweat</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="5.43">Nick&amp;#39;s ex-boyfriend Richard vanetti a</text>
  <text start="275.73" dur="4.36">registered Democrat took out a</text>
  <text start="278.14" dur="5.79">restraining order against her and says</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="5.85">he has evidence that she&amp;#39;s lying and he</text>
  <text start="283.93" dur="3.78">went on to say after I broke up with her</text>
  <text start="285.94" dur="3.51">she was threatening my family</text>
  <text start="287.71" dur="6.209">threatening my wife threatening to do</text>
  <text start="289.45" dur="6.5">harm to my baby at the time he went on</text>
  <text start="293.919" dur="4.891">to say I have a lot of facts evidence</text>
  <text start="295.95" dur="3.25">that what she&amp;#39;s saying is not true at</text>
  <text start="298.81" dur="2.28">all</text>
  <text start="299.2" dur="5.51">I would rather speak to my attorney</text>
  <text start="301.09" dur="6.57">first before we before saying more now a</text>
  <text start="304.71" dur="5.95">vanetti calls those claims outrageous</text>
  <text start="307.66" dur="4.23">but his claims are real of course he</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="3.78">saying he doesn&amp;#39;t have to produce any</text>
  <text start="311.89" dur="5.67">evidence whatsoever which is very</text>
  <text start="314.44" dur="5.729">interesting we see journalist Thomas</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="4.14">Richter discovered that a report about</text>
  <text start="320.169" dur="4.141">sweating by the Guardian had</text>
  <text start="321.7" dur="5.46">mysteriously been altered to remove a</text>
  <text start="324.31" dur="6.81">reference to her former employer New</text>
  <text start="327.16" dur="6.93">York life now Thomas Viktor tweeted out</text>
  <text start="331.12" dur="5.28">the following the original Guardian</text>
  <text start="334.09" dur="6.329">article has been edited they took out</text>
  <text start="336.4" dur="6.45">the sentence a 2007 report in a New</text>
  <text start="340.419" dur="4.651">Jersey newspaper in which she was quoted</text>
  <text start="342.85" dur="3.33">as a member of the public preparing for</text>
  <text start="345.07" dur="3.57">that year&amp;#39;s Superbowl</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="5.6">said she then worked for New York Life</text>
  <text start="348.64" dur="6.12">the insurance company lo and behold</text>
  <text start="351.78" dur="5.92">sweat Nick made a sexual harassment</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="5.73">claim against New York Life and used the</text>
  <text start="357.7" dur="6.39">firm run by Christine blasting Ford&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="5.33">attorney to represent her now this is</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="4.949">very interesting</text>
  <text start="365.82" dur="5.65">Thomas Victor went on to say the accuser</text>
  <text start="369.039" dur="5.371">also doesn&amp;#39;t list her time at New York</text>
  <text start="371.47" dur="8.73">life on her resume so this was a totally</text>
  <text start="374.41" dur="7.89">coordinated hit job now more information</text>
  <text start="380.2" dur="4.11">came out and there were two men that</text>
  <text start="382.3" dur="4.95">claimed to be the real culprits behind</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="4.68">the assault on Ford and I think this was</text>
  <text start="387.25" dur="4.05">a complete setup because why would they</text>
  <text start="388.99" dur="5.04">come forward and say no it was really me</text>
  <text start="391.3" dur="4.65">we were the ones who did this and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="394.03" dur="4.23">take the blame this just seems a little</text>
  <text start="395.95" dur="6.24">outrageous and I believe this was a</text>
  <text start="398.26" dur="5.49">complete set up to try to switch things</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="4.11">around but I don&amp;#39;t think it worked</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="6.69">now throughout the hearing today with</text>
  <text start="406.3" dur="7.26">dr. Ford and Cavanaugh during dr. Ford&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.44" dur="5.49">testimony we continually heard that we</text>
  <text start="413.56" dur="5.07">should have an FBI investigation an FBI</text>
  <text start="415.93" dur="5.13">investigation and during Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="418.63" dur="3.15">time they asked him the same thing don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="421.06" dur="2.13">you think we should have an</text>
  <text start="421.78" dur="2.94">investigation shouldn&amp;#39;t you call for an</text>
  <text start="423.19" dur="3.72">investigation and the reason why they</text>
  <text start="424.72" dur="4.53">keep harping on this is because they</text>
  <text start="426.91" dur="3.78">want this postponed and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="429.25" dur="3.99">to do whatever they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="430.69" dur="5.009">postpone this instead of really looking</text>
  <text start="433.24" dur="4.44">at the evidence that is right in front</text>
  <text start="435.699" dur="3.511">of them but let me just go back in time</text>
  <text start="437.68" dur="4.17">to 1991</text>
  <text start="439.21" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;re former Vice President Joe Biden at</text>
  <text start="441.85" dur="4.26">the Senate Judiciary Committee during</text>
  <text start="444.28" dur="4.65">the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hearings</text>
  <text start="446.11" dur="4.709">dismissed any conclusions the FBI came</text>
  <text start="448.93" dur="4.5">to in the report about the sexual</text>
  <text start="450.819" dur="6.211">harassment allegations made against</text>
  <text start="453.43" dur="5.88">Thomas at the time he went on to say the</text>
  <text start="457.03" dur="4.229">next person who refers to an FBI report</text>
  <text start="459.31" dur="3.15">as being worth anything obviously</text>
  <text start="461.259" dur="4.081">doesn&amp;#39;t understand anything</text>
  <text start="462.46" dur="6.12">the FBI explicitly does not in this or</text>
  <text start="465.34" dur="6.57">any other case reach a conclusion period</text>
  <text start="468.58" dur="6.03">so judge there is no reason why you</text>
  <text start="471.91" dur="4.77">should know this the reason why we</text>
  <text start="474.61" dur="4.08">cannot rely on the FBI report you</text>
  <text start="476.68" dur="3.95">wouldn&amp;#39;t like it if we did because it is</text>
  <text start="478.69" dur="5.94">inconclusive</text>
  <text start="480.63" dur="8.259">he continued they say he said she said</text>
  <text start="484.63" dur="7.92">and they said period so when people wave</text>
  <text start="488.889" dur="5.821">an FBI report before you understand they</text>
  <text start="492.55" dur="5.399">do not they do not they do not reach</text>
  <text start="494.71" dur="5.67">conclusion they do not make as my friend</text>
  <text start="497.949" dur="5.4">points out more accurately they do not</text>
  <text start="500.38" dur="5.969">make recommendations take a listen to</text>
  <text start="503.349" dur="6.181">what he said during that period in 1991</text>
  <text start="506.349" dur="5.401">the last thing I&amp;#39;ll point out the next</text>
  <text start="509.53" dur="5.069">person refers to an FBI report as being</text>
  <text start="511.75" dur="5.779">worth anything obviously doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="514.599" dur="7.56">understand anything</text>
  <text start="517.529" dur="11.161">FBI explicitly does not in this or any</text>
  <text start="522.159" dur="11.311">other case reach a conclusion period</text>
  <text start="528.69" dur="6.79">period so judges no reason why you</text>
  <text start="533.47" dur="4.14">should know this the reason why we</text>
  <text start="535.48" dur="4.74">cannot rely on the FBI report you</text>
  <text start="537.61" dur="5.45">wouldn&amp;#39;t like it if we did because it is</text>
  <text start="540.22" dur="6.47">in conclusive</text>
  <text start="543.06" dur="8.98">they say he said she said and they said</text>
  <text start="546.69" dur="10.269">period so when people wave an FBI report</text>
  <text start="552.04" dur="9.56">before you understand they do not they</text>
  <text start="556.959" dur="7.831">do not they do not reach conclusions</text>
  <text start="561.6" dur="5.37">they do not make as my friend points out</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="5.13">more adequate they do not make</text>
  <text start="566.97" dur="6.34">recommendations now during the hearing</text>
  <text start="569.92" dur="5.94">dr. Ford went first she tests the</text>
  <text start="573.31" dur="4.92">I answered questions and then Cavanaugh</text>
  <text start="575.86" dur="4.35">went afterwards and of course when both</text>
  <text start="578.23" dur="3.09">of them were up they were asking you</text>
  <text start="580.21" dur="2.88">know shouldn&amp;#39;t we have an FBI</text>
  <text start="581.32" dur="3.48">investigation shouldn&amp;#39;t call from one</text>
  <text start="583.09" dur="4.35">and they keep doing this because they</text>
  <text start="584.8" dur="4.86">want to postpone this and we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="587.44" dur="4.5">going to go into oh how did this person</text>
  <text start="589.66" dur="4.28">look how did that person sound we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="591.94" dur="5.04">just gonna look at the facts and the</text>
  <text start="593.94" dur="6.089">inconsistencies of the story and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="596.98" dur="5.73">what we&amp;#39;re gonna look at right here now</text>
  <text start="600.029" dur="5.081">during this whole process we know that</text>
  <text start="602.71" dur="6.78">Dianne Feinstein she received a letter</text>
  <text start="605.11" dur="7.44">from a congresswoman issue and we know</text>
  <text start="609.49" dur="6.09">that dr. Ford gave this letter to her</text>
  <text start="612.55" dur="5.07">and then it was leaked or she was</text>
  <text start="615.58" dur="6.03">actually reported it to the Washington</text>
  <text start="617.62" dur="5.64">Post which then published what happened</text>
  <text start="621.61" dur="3.81">and of course this is the way the deep</text>
  <text start="623.26" dur="4.26">state works because they needed to get</text>
  <text start="625.42" dur="7.05">out into the mainstream media to build</text>
  <text start="627.52" dur="9.81">sympathy and during this time way back</text>
  <text start="632.47" dur="7.65">when they knew once Kavanaugh was the</text>
  <text start="637.33" dur="4.98">choice of Trump they should have said</text>
  <text start="640.12" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute we have this</text>
  <text start="642.31" dur="4.14">individual we should have an</text>
  <text start="644.47" dur="4.41">investigation but they didn&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="646.45" dur="5.55">they waited and they waited and they</text>
  <text start="648.88" dur="6.93">waited until the very end and during</text>
  <text start="652" dur="6.21">this time they said hey dr. Ford why</text>
  <text start="655.81" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t you come here and give us your</text>
  <text start="658.21" dur="5.22">testimony explain to us what happened</text>
  <text start="660.88" dur="6.32">she said I can&amp;#39;t go there because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="663.43" dur="7.04">afraid of flying so I can&amp;#39;t fly to DC</text>
  <text start="667.2" dur="7.12">now when Rachel Mitchell was</text>
  <text start="670.47" dur="6.82">cross-examining blondie Ford during the</text>
  <text start="674.32" dur="8.55">Senate Judiciary Committee she asked her</text>
  <text start="677.29" dur="8.15">about her fear of flying and this whole</text>
  <text start="682.87" dur="6.24">thing started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="685.44" dur="5.41">under questioning by Mitchell Ford a</text>
  <text start="689.11" dur="4.53">minute that she had in fact flown across</text>
  <text start="690.85" dur="4.56">the country to make the hearing she had</text>
  <text start="693.64" dur="3.42">also flown to the East Coast for a</text>
  <text start="695.41" dur="4.74">vacation with family in August actually</text>
  <text start="697.06" dur="4.649">she said she did this every year she</text>
  <text start="700.15" dur="4.65">flew to the East Coast to be with family</text>
  <text start="701.709" dur="5.451">she also admitted flying frequently for</text>
  <text start="704.8" dur="4.849">her work and for her hobbies including</text>
  <text start="707.16" dur="6.69">surfing vacations in Hawaii Costa Rica</text>
  <text start="709.649" dur="6.571">French Polynesia and right there and</text>
  <text start="713.85" dur="3.84">then if you are afraid of flying and I</text>
  <text start="716.22" dur="3.659">know actually one person who is afraid</text>
  <text start="717.69" dur="5.069">of flying they can&amp;#39;t step on a plane</text>
  <text start="719.879" dur="6.091">they have to drive to different places</text>
  <text start="722.759" dur="5.25">so if you&amp;#39;re truly afraid of flying you</text>
  <text start="725.97" dur="4.229">would not be flying all over this all</text>
  <text start="728.009" dur="5.281">over the country or all over the world</text>
  <text start="730.199" dur="5.731">actually so that&amp;#39;s the first thing now</text>
  <text start="733.29" dur="6.239">during this whole hearing they were</text>
  <text start="735.93" dur="6.329">asking her certain questions and Blasi</text>
  <text start="739.529" dur="6.081">for it says she can&amp;#39;t remember if she</text>
  <text start="742.259" dur="6.211">gave her therapist notes to a reporter</text>
  <text start="745.61" dur="5.979">but the washington post claims that they</text>
  <text start="748.47" dur="6.45">had them so this was just a couple of</text>
  <text start="751.589" dur="5.85">months ago so a couple of months ago she</text>
  <text start="754.92" dur="6.87">could not remember if she handed over</text>
  <text start="757.439" dur="9.241">her notes but 35 years ago she&amp;#39;s 100%</text>
  <text start="761.79" dur="6.32">sure that it&amp;#39;s absolutely Kavanagh now</text>
  <text start="766.68" dur="4.38">this is kind of strange</text>
  <text start="768.11" dur="5.95">you don&amp;#39;t remember if you gave your</text>
  <text start="771.06" dur="6.29">notes over to The Washington Post this</text>
  <text start="774.06" dur="6.69">is this is kind of odd so we also have</text>
  <text start="777.35" dur="5.37">inconsistencies with her dates now for</text>

  <text start="877.74" dur="9.719">it&amp;#39;s the 11th and 13th something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="881.339" dur="8.25">match up so Cavanaugh has filed an</text>

  <text start="899.13" dur="4.699">decided that listen I will take a</text>
  <text start="900.72" dur="5.16">polygraph test now she was in town</text>
  <text start="903.829" dur="5.171">during that period because her</text>
  <text start="905.88" dur="4.98">grandmother just passed away so on the</text>
  <text start="909" dur="5.07">same day or maybe the day after her</text>
  <text start="910.86" dur="5.82">grandmother&amp;#39;s funeral she decided to go</text>
  <text start="914.07" dur="7.44">ahead with the polygraph test and the</text>
  <text start="916.68" dur="7.469">polygrapher came to her and they asked</text>
  <text start="921.51" dur="5.97">her questions was there a video camera</text>
  <text start="924.149" dur="6.781">there was their audio showing you taking</text>
  <text start="927.48" dur="5.7">this tense test and she didn&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="930.93" dur="4.98">a camera or anything else she just</text>
  <text start="933.18" dur="4.649">remembers being hooked up I mean most of</text>
  <text start="935.91" dur="5.31">the time they have a camera on a tripod</text>
  <text start="937.829" dur="4.801">and they face it towards you most of the</text>
  <text start="941.22" dur="3.57">time they say they&amp;#39;re gonna record this</text>
  <text start="942.63" dur="3.93">they may take a couple test shots saying</text>
  <text start="944.79" dur="3.72">you know let me hear your voice let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="946.56" dur="3.899">make sure this records and they go ahead</text>
  <text start="948.51" dur="3.54">with it so she doesn&amp;#39;t remember if</text>
  <text start="950.459" dur="6.151">there&amp;#39;s a video or audio which means</text>
  <text start="952.05" dur="6.39">most likely there was no no video or</text>
  <text start="956.61" dur="3.839">audio there which means there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="958.44" dur="4.2">evidence that it was her who actually</text>
  <text start="960.449" dur="4.711">took it but that&amp;#39;s besides the point and</text>
  <text start="962.64" dur="5.939">we&amp;#39;ll get into the polygraph test in a</text>
  <text start="965.16" dur="6.03">little bit now during the hearing they</text>
  <text start="968.579" dur="4.931">brought up a map to show where the party</text>
  <text start="971.19" dur="5.5">was where the swimming pool was</text>
  <text start="973.51" dur="5.43">Ford had acknowledged that on the day of</text>
  <text start="976.69" dur="4.47">the alleged incident someone had to</text>
  <text start="978.94" dur="4.23">drive her from the swimming pool to the</text>
  <text start="981.16" dur="3.36">house because the house is located</text>
  <text start="983.17" dur="6.12">between the swimming pool and her house</text>
  <text start="984.52" dur="6.03">which are 15 miles apart now this is</text>
  <text start="989.29" dur="4.59">very interesting because somebody had to</text>
  <text start="990.55" dur="6.15">drive her but she couldn&amp;#39;t remember who</text>
  <text start="993.88" dur="5.7">drove her from the swimming pool to the</text>
  <text start="996.7" dur="4.77">house now don&amp;#39;t you think this is</text>
  <text start="999.58" dur="4.77">important don&amp;#39;t you think she would</text>
  <text start="1001.47" dur="6.39">remember who drove her to the party</text>
  <text start="1004.35" dur="5.28">I mean find the driver and we have more</text>
  <text start="1007.86" dur="4.17">information of what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="1009.63" dur="4.68">we also learned today that four can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1012.03" dur="4.05">remember time date location of the party</text>
  <text start="1014.31" dur="4.14">who drove her to the party which would</text>
  <text start="1016.08" dur="3.84">just mention who was at the party who</text>
  <text start="1018.45" dur="3.81">pushed her into the room she said it was</text>
  <text start="1019.92" dur="3.93">Cavanaugh and judge but she&amp;#39;s not sure</text>
  <text start="1022.26" dur="2.67">if it was actually judge or Cavanaugh</text>
  <text start="1023.85" dur="3.84">who pushed her because it came from</text>
  <text start="1024.93" dur="6.63">behind who drove her from the party and</text>
  <text start="1027.69" dur="5.85">who paid for her polygraph test can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1031.56" dur="3.87">remember any of this or doesn&amp;#39;t know any</text>
  <text start="1033.54" dur="5.28">of this information but she&amp;#39;s 100% sure</text>
  <text start="1035.43" dur="5.82">it was Cavanaugh 36 years ago which is</text>
  <text start="1038.82" dur="4.86">very strange now let&amp;#39;s look at the</text>
  <text start="1041.25" dur="4.199">polygraph test here now the biggest</text>
  <text start="1043.68" dur="4.23">problem with the so-called lie detector</text>
  <text start="1045.449" dur="5.401">results are the examiner never actually</text>
  <text start="1047.91" dur="4.5">asked questions about Cavanaugh during</text>
  <text start="1050.85" dur="3.39">the polygraph test now we mentioned this</text>
  <text start="1052.41" dur="4.59">previously in the report before we knew</text>
  <text start="1054.24" dur="4.83">anything about this the person</text>
  <text start="1057" dur="3.9">conducting the polygraph who was a third</text>
  <text start="1059.07" dur="4.68">party examiner and not a law enforcement</text>
  <text start="1060.9" dur="5.49">official had Ford&amp;#39;s scribbled down her</text>
  <text start="1063.75" dur="5.13">nearly 40-year old memory and then at</text>
  <text start="1066.39" dur="5.04">the drunken party and then asked her to</text>
  <text start="1068.88" dur="4.92">vague questions those two questions were</text>
  <text start="1071.43" dur="4.32">is any part of your statement false and</text>
  <text start="1073.8" dur="4.68">did you make up any part of your</text>
  <text start="1075.75" dur="4.49">statement this is absolutely important</text>
  <text start="1078.48" dur="4.71">to understand again the polygraph test</text>
  <text start="1080.24" dur="5.38">didn&amp;#39;t actually ask the main accuser any</text>
  <text start="1083.19" dur="4.74">questions about Cavanaugh his name was</text>
  <text start="1085.62" dur="4.5">never brought up by the interviewer and</text>
  <text start="1087.93" dur="4.86">I would like to see the therapist knows</text>
  <text start="1090.12" dur="5.94">because back in 2012 when they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1092.79" dur="5.64">therapy she talked about this and um I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1096.06" dur="4.89">be shocked to see if she mentioned</text>
  <text start="1098.43" dur="3.93">Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s name at that time because</text>
  <text start="1100.95" dur="3.87">she said she mentioned it to her husband</text>
  <text start="1102.36" dur="4.17">which means it has to be most likely in</text>
  <text start="1104.82" dur="2.19">the therapists notes now I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="1106.53" dur="2.279">some</text>
  <text start="1107.01" dur="3.84">didn&amp;#39;t happen to her I believe that</text>
  <text start="1108.809" dur="3.811">she&amp;#39;s definitely is going through</text>
  <text start="1110.85" dur="3.959">something and something definitely</text>
  <text start="1112.62" dur="4.26">happened I just don&amp;#39;t think it was it</text>
  <text start="1114.809" dur="4.74">was with Kavanagh now to make matters</text>
  <text start="1116.88" dur="4.44">worse the statement from four that she</text>
  <text start="1119.549" dur="4.681">was then asked about by the polygraph</text>
  <text start="1121.32" dur="4.56">examiner directly contradicts different</text>
  <text start="1124.23" dur="4.53">versions of the alleged event that the</text>
  <text start="1125.88" dur="4.799">accuser also given Ford&amp;#39;s polygraph</text>
  <text start="1128.76" dur="4.23">letter contradicts letter she sent the</text>
  <text start="1130.679" dur="4.831">Feinstein now the polygraph letter says</text>
  <text start="1132.99" dur="5.67">four boys and a couple of girls were at</text>
  <text start="1135.51" dur="6.14">a party letter to Feinstein says me and</text>
  <text start="1138.66" dur="4.8">four others no way to reconcile the two</text>
  <text start="1141.65" dur="4.36">irrespective of whether she&amp;#39;s counting</text>
  <text start="1143.46" dur="4.95">herself in the polygraph letter it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1146.01" dur="4.23">important to remember that fundamental</text>
  <text start="1148.41" dur="3.81">facts such as how many people witnessed</text>
  <text start="1150.24" dur="4.02">the alleged incident and what their</text>
  <text start="1152.22" dur="3.959">genders were have been up in the air</text>
  <text start="1154.26" dur="4.049">already even journalists from the</text>
  <text start="1156.179" dur="4.231">Washington Post are seemingly unable to</text>
  <text start="1158.309" dur="4.261">keep the details straight and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1160.41" dur="3.66">another huge point the fact that Ford</text>
  <text start="1162.57" dur="3.03">passed the polygraph based on a</text>
  <text start="1164.07" dur="3.72">statement that she later herself</text>
  <text start="1165.6" dur="4.5">contradicted while telling the story to</text>
  <text start="1167.79" dur="6.379">other people shows how unreliable the</text>
  <text start="1170.1" dur="6.56">evidence truly is now here&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="1174.169" dur="6.971">strange twist in the story</text>
  <text start="1176.66" dur="8.85">Jill Struck&amp;#39;s which is Peter Struck&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1181.14" dur="8.84">sister-in-law works with Thomas Blasi</text>
  <text start="1185.51" dur="8.59">Thomas Blasi is Christine Ford&amp;#39;s brother</text>
  <text start="1189.98" dur="8.199">so Christine Ford and Peter struck have</text>
  <text start="1194.1" dur="7.05">a connection which is kind of strange we</text>
  <text start="1198.179" dur="6.091">also understand that Cavanaugh when it</text>
  <text start="1201.15" dur="4.25">was his time to testify he handed over</text>
  <text start="1204.27" dur="4.289">his calendar</text>
  <text start="1205.4" dur="5.29">going back into the 80s why did he keep</text>
  <text start="1208.559" dur="4.801">a calendar he said his father kept a</text>
  <text start="1210.69" dur="5.09">calendar in the 70s and his father still</text>
  <text start="1213.36" dur="5.069">has all his calendars and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1215.78" dur="6.25">Cavanaugh kept his calendar and it shows</text>
  <text start="1218.429" dur="7.38">that he was not in town during this</text>
  <text start="1222.03" dur="8.56">period of time so right there and then</text>
  <text start="1225.809" dur="8.23">we have a major problem now</text>
  <text start="1230.59" dur="5.699">dr. Ford is saying that her email was</text>
  <text start="1234.039" dur="4.561">hacked into after going public with</text>
  <text start="1236.289" dur="5.01">sexual assault allegations who hacked it</text>
  <text start="1238.6" dur="4.47">we don&amp;#39;t know and it&amp;#39;s unclear what</text>
  <text start="1241.299" dur="5.671">information was taken from her account</text>
  <text start="1243.07" dur="6.209">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that Rex</text>
  <text start="1246.97" dur="4.079">came out and I believe his Twitter</text>
  <text start="1249.279" dur="3.841">account blocks him from tweeting right</text>
  <text start="1251.049" dur="5.281">now said the following and I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1253.12" dur="5.809">if this ties into her account being</text>
  <text start="1256.33" dur="5.43">hacked or not but it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1258.929" dur="6.011">Rex says okay I&amp;#39;m allowed to say this</text>
  <text start="1261.76" dur="5.19">number one emails exist where Blasi Ford</text>
  <text start="1264.94" dur="5.219">is freaking out and amidst the story is</text>
  <text start="1266.95" dur="6.27">nonsense BS two well-known names number</text>
  <text start="1270.159" dur="6.721">two there&amp;#39;s a Gorsuch letter and number</text>
  <text start="1273.22" dur="8.16">three there is more make of that what</text>
  <text start="1276.88" dur="7.86">you will and that&amp;#39;s what Rex said so her</text>
  <text start="1281.38" dur="6.149">email was hacked into information was</text>
  <text start="1284.74" dur="5.309">retrieved and they do believe or that</text>
  <text start="1287.529" dur="4.591">he&amp;#39;s saying that there&amp;#39;s information in</text>
  <text start="1290.049" dur="5.88">there where she&amp;#39;s talking to people</text>
  <text start="1292.12" dur="6.029">about different things now this whole</text>
  <text start="1295.929" dur="6.36">thing that we&amp;#39;re watching right now is</text>
  <text start="1298.149" dur="6.061">one gigantic distraction the swamp they</text>
  <text start="1302.289" dur="5.161">are distracting all of this and of</text>
  <text start="1304.21" dur="5.04">course they don&amp;#39;t want him confirmed if</text>
  <text start="1307.45" dur="4.17">you really think about it through this</text>
  <text start="1309.25" dur="6.12">whole entire period we have not heard</text>
  <text start="1311.62" dur="4.289">anything about FISA no one&amp;#39;s tweeting</text>
  <text start="1315.37" dur="2.7">about it</text>
  <text start="1315.909" dur="5.821">nobody&amp;#39;s saying anything it anything</text>
  <text start="1318.07" dur="5.79">about it the mainstream media completely</text>
  <text start="1321.73" dur="4.049">blank there&amp;#39;s nothing about this</text>
  <text start="1323.86" dur="5.22">whatsoever because this is taking up the</text>
  <text start="1325.779" dur="6.181">airwaves now remember the whole tactic</text>
  <text start="1329.08" dur="4.44">here is to try to postpone the</text>
  <text start="1331.96" dur="3.689">confirmation vote and if they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1333.52" dur="4.2">postpone the confirmation vote what</text>
  <text start="1335.649" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to try to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1337.72" dur="6.42">going to try to damage Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1340.029" dur="6.811">credibility to make people think that he</text>
  <text start="1344.14" dur="4.46">is guilty of this and of course right</text>
  <text start="1346.84" dur="5.01">now there is no evidence whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1348.6" dur="5.319">showing that he&amp;#39;s guilty of this yes</text>
  <text start="1351.85" dur="4.53">someone is alleging this but they</text>
  <text start="1353.919" dur="5.39">haven&amp;#39;t proved it with witnesses they</text>
  <text start="1356.38" dur="5.76">haven&amp;#39;t proved it with actual proof and</text>
  <text start="1359.309" dur="4.461">his calendar coming forward shows that</text>
  <text start="1362.14" dur="4.87">he wasn&amp;#39;t even in town</text>
  <text start="1363.77" dur="5.67">now it looks like Rosenstein decided to</text>
  <text start="1367.01" dur="5.91">go to the White House and try to meet</text>
  <text start="1369.44" dur="5.88">with Trump Trump put him off and said</text>
  <text start="1372.92" dur="4.8">listen let&amp;#39;s not meet right now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1375.32" dur="3.93">wait until the hearings are over because</text>
  <text start="1377.72" dur="1.94">we I don&amp;#39;t want this to interfere with</text>
  <text start="1379.25" dur="4.35">this</text>
  <text start="1379.66" dur="5.98">so rod rose Rosen Stein is still trying</text>
  <text start="1383.6" dur="4.079">to meet with Trump and every time</text>
  <text start="1385.64" dur="4.95">Trump continually says you know</text>
  <text start="1387.679" dur="5.581">something this is not the right time we</text>
  <text start="1390.59" dur="5.64">found out that George Soros funded</text>
  <text start="1393.26" dur="5.7">fusion GPS now a spokesman for</text>
  <text start="1396.23" dur="4.89">billionaire financier George Soros is</text>
  <text start="1398.96" dur="5.16">acknowledging that he in directly funded</text>
  <text start="1401.12" dur="5.43">GPS the firm behind the steal dossier</text>
  <text start="1404.12" dur="4.74">and Soros has been behind a lot of</text>
  <text start="1406.55" dur="3.06">different things the refugees out in the</text>
  <text start="1408.86" dur="3.63">Middle East</text>
  <text start="1409.61" dur="5.28">funding different groups and NGOs and</text>
  <text start="1412.49" dur="5.13">I&amp;#39;m not really shocked that he helped</text>
  <text start="1414.89" dur="5.64">with this at all we see Trump is out</text>
  <text start="1417.62" dur="5.07">there and he is saying that China is</text>
  <text start="1420.53" dur="4.98">getting ready to interfere in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1422.69" dur="5.66">elections and the translation of this is</text>
  <text start="1425.51" dur="6.21">that the deep state is getting ready to</text>
  <text start="1428.35" dur="5.02">try to manipulate the upcoming elections</text>
  <text start="1431.72" dur="3.54">and remember he has the executive order</text>
  <text start="1433.37" dur="3.809">in place that if any foreign entity or</text>
  <text start="1435.26" dur="4.02">any person interferes with the election</text>
  <text start="1437.179" dur="4.561">his executive order would kick in and</text>
  <text start="1439.28" dur="5.19">all of a sudden he can confiscate their</text>
  <text start="1441.74" dur="6.06">properties and gather information on the</text>
  <text start="1444.47" dur="5.339">on the people and it would not go down</text>
  <text start="1447.8" dur="4.23">well for those individuals and I think</text>
  <text start="1449.809" dur="4.381">what he&amp;#39;s continually doing while he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1452.03" dur="4.14">saying this is he&amp;#39;s warning those</text>
  <text start="1454.19" dur="4.83">individuals that are getting ready to</text>
  <text start="1456.17" dur="5.43">interfere with the elections now we need</text>
  <text start="1459.02" dur="5.13">to understand that q has continually</text>
  <text start="1461.6" dur="4.709">said the Patriots are in control this is</text>
  <text start="1464.15" dur="4.35">part of the plan they knew this was</text>
  <text start="1466.309" dur="4.471">coming and I&amp;#39;m sure they set up some</text>
  <text start="1468.5" dur="4.41">safeguards that they&amp;#39;re already ahead of</text>
  <text start="1470.78" dur="3.63">the game and we&amp;#39;re gonna see allow this</text>
  <text start="1472.91" dur="4.26">information come out now</text>
  <text start="1474.41" dur="5.67">I think the deeps they played their hand</text>
  <text start="1477.17" dur="5.009">before testified and all the other</text>
  <text start="1480.08" dur="4.59">accounts while they&amp;#39;re being debunked</text>
  <text start="1482.179" dur="5.311">right now again remember they did not</text>
  <text start="1484.67" dur="5.49">file an affidavit the affidavit swearing</text>
  <text start="1487.49" dur="4.98">under penalty of perjury all they did</text>
  <text start="1490.16" dur="4.53">was tell their story to the mainstream</text>
  <text start="1492.47" dur="4.589">media to put it out there to make it a</text>
  <text start="1494.69" dur="4.319">circus they did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="1497.059" dur="4.261">and you can see that there are certain</text>
  <text start="1499.009" dur="5.851">individuals within the deep state that</text>
  <text start="1501.32" dur="6.179">are behind this so we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1504.86" dur="4.409">the hearings are happening they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="1507.499" dur="3.66">scheduling the confirmation vote we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1509.269" dur="4.74">have to see if that happens and if this</text>
  <text start="1511.159" dur="5.85">does happen it coordinates exactly with</text>
  <text start="1514.009" dur="5.13">the presidential alert system now we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1517.009" dur="4.111">have to see if they delay it if the</text>
  <text start="1519.139" dur="3.481">Senate Judiciary Committee comes back</text>
  <text start="1521.12" dur="3.72">and says ok there wasn&amp;#39;t enough evidence</text>
  <text start="1522.62" dur="4.25">where there was enough evidence at this</text>
  <text start="1524.84" dur="4.909">time there&amp;#39;s so many inconsistencies</text>
  <text start="1526.87" dur="5.86">things really don&amp;#39;t make sense and</text>
  <text start="1529.749" dur="5.471">actually Kavanagh right now has his</text>
  <text start="1532.73" dur="4.98">calendar which actually shows what she</text>
  <text start="1535.22" dur="5.1">kept for a very long time where he was</text>
  <text start="1537.71" dur="5.76">what he was doing and where he was at</text>
  <text start="1540.32" dur="6.51">that time so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this</text>
  <text start="1543.47" dur="6.6">plays out but going back to cue Patriots</text>
  <text start="1546.83" dur="4.77">are in control listen everyone thanks a</text>
