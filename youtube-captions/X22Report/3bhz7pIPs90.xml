  <text start="31.31" dur="6.59">is can you feel it there is a</text>
  <text start="34.25" dur="5.55">disturbance in the economic collapse and</text>
  <text start="37.9" dur="4.089">basically today we&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="39.8" dur="4.02">through what&amp;#39;s been going on today and</text>
  <text start="41.989" dur="6.631">there&amp;#39;s been a lot of stuff going on</text>
  <text start="43.82" dur="6.75">today and by the end of this I just want</text>
  <text start="48.62" dur="6.93">to wrap up with a couple of quotes from</text>
  <text start="50.57" dur="7.62">our founding fathers and what they</text>
  <text start="55.55" dur="6.3">thought about gun control what did they</text>
  <text start="58.19" dur="5.099">think about the central bank&amp;#39;s and not</text>
  <text start="61.85" dur="3.48">just our founding fathers but also</text>
  <text start="63.289" dur="4.531">Abraham Lincoln and I just wanted I</text>
  <text start="65.33" dur="5.61">wanted to go back and see what all their</text>
  <text start="67.82" dur="7.32">thoughts were on what is going on and I</text>
  <text start="70.94" dur="8.42">have to say it is not that much of a</text>
  <text start="75.14" dur="7.019">difference what is going on right now</text>
  <text start="79.36" dur="9.34">but you know let&amp;#39;s start with the</text>
  <text start="82.159" dur="12.151">current news and basically we had</text>
  <text start="88.7" dur="8.79">Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and many</text>
  <text start="94.31" dur="6.48">many other institutions they all got the</text>
  <text start="97.49" dur="6.51">Fed minutes a day early now you have to</text>
  <text start="100.79" dur="7.71">ask yourself why do they need the</text>
  <text start="104" dur="6.149">minutes early and basically they&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="108.5" dur="5.61">you know people are asking this question</text>
  <text start="110.149" dur="7.86">and we don&amp;#39;t know why but what&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="114.11" dur="8.16">about today is that gold was completely</text>
  <text start="118.009" dur="7.921">slammed down and silver was slammed down</text>
  <text start="122.27" dur="7.91">quite a bit but we&amp;#39;ll get into that a</text>
  <text start="125.93" dur="6.99">little bit later now North Korea is</text>
  <text start="130.18" dur="8.14">threatening a nuclear strike on Tokyo an</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="8.04">event of a missile test because you know</text>
  <text start="138.32" dur="6.06">if Japan strikes</text>
  <text start="140.96" dur="6.84">missile down they will hit Tokyo but I</text>
  <text start="144.38" dur="6.21">we talked about this and again if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.8" dur="5.66">firing a test missile within the borders</text>
  <text start="150.59" dur="6.03">of your country and another missile</text>
  <text start="153.46" dur="9.25">comes out of nowhere and brings down the</text>
  <text start="156.62" dur="8.67">missile who&amp;#39;s really starting the war so</text>
  <text start="162.71" dur="4.61">to me I mean this is I feel like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="165.29" dur="4.77">trying to make us look someplace and</text>
  <text start="167.32" dur="7.66">distract us from other things that</text>
  <text start="170.06" dur="10.05">they&amp;#39;re doing for for instance I mean</text>
  <text start="174.98" dur="7.38">the other day we we saw a an article</text>
  <text start="180.11" dur="7.2">come out from Reuters saying that the</text>
  <text start="182.36" dur="9.78">Cyprus people we&amp;#39;re going to pay off</text>
  <text start="187.31" dur="6.75">their debts with ten tons of gold but</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="4.56">then the Cypriot government came out and</text>
  <text start="194.06" dur="8.27">said no we we have no idea about this</text>
  <text start="196.7" dur="9.15">and what&amp;#39;s funny is was this story</text>
  <text start="202.33" dur="5.44">leaked too early not leak but published</text>
  <text start="205.85" dur="5.76">too early it wasn&amp;#39;t meant to be</text>
  <text start="207.77" dur="8.3">published yet and no one knew about it</text>
  <text start="211.61" dur="8.82">and now it&amp;#39;s already out there so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.07" dur="6.64">it&amp;#39;s already done but today Mario Draghi</text>
  <text start="220.43" dur="6.57">orders Cyprus to sell gold to cover</text>
  <text start="222.71" dur="12.39">bailout shortfall and with the Cyprus</text>
  <text start="227" dur="11.28">people they are continually needing more</text>
  <text start="235.1" dur="6.36">and more money to get out of the hole</text>
  <text start="238.28" dur="6.51">that they&amp;#39;re in and they just increased</text>
  <text start="241.46" dur="6.99">the capital controls for another seven</text>
  <text start="244.79" dur="4.83">days so we&amp;#39;ve said this in the past that</text>
  <text start="248.45" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re good they&amp;#39;re never going to let</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="6.33">these capital controls go it looks like</text>
  <text start="252.32" dur="7.34">Cyprus is getting worse and worse not</text>
  <text start="255.95" dur="6.36">better and this is turning into a</text>
  <text start="259.66" dur="5.5">terrible terrible situation for the</text>
  <text start="262.31" dur="5.07">Cypriot people and every time they come</text>
  <text start="265.16" dur="4.14">out with something new it&amp;#39;s always they</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="6.82">need more money now they&amp;#39;re selling</text>
  <text start="269.3" dur="6.52">their gold where we are</text>
  <text start="274.2" dur="3.48">extending the capital controls and I</text>
  <text start="275.82" dur="3.48">believe they&amp;#39;re there these will never</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;ll just keep extending them because</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="6.12">there&amp;#39;s no way they&amp;#39;re going to lift the</text>
  <text start="282.45" dur="5.34">capital controls and let the Cyprus</text>
  <text start="285.42" dur="4.68">people run to the bank and get whatever</text>
  <text start="287.79" dur="6.23">money they have leftover out of the bank</text>
  <text start="290.1" dur="8.4">there it&amp;#39;s no way it&amp;#39;s impossible now</text>
  <text start="294.02" dur="8.2">talking about gold here I mean we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="6.63">seen today that gold has was slammed</text>
  <text start="302.22" dur="10.1">down at at one point it was below 1500</text>
  <text start="305.13" dur="10.23">and as of right now it looks like</text>
  <text start="312.32" dur="7.36">they&amp;#39;re keeping it under 1500 I mean</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="9.24">it&amp;#39;s at right now it&amp;#39;s a 333 eastern</text>
  <text start="319.68" dur="9.69">time p.m. it&amp;#39;s at 1491 so they slammed</text>
  <text start="324.6" dur="7.41">it 76 dollars off from the one the day</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="5.22">started so they are slamming this down</text>
  <text start="332.01" dur="7.29">and everyone&amp;#39;s running around like crazy</text>
  <text start="334.59" dur="7.44">oh my god you know look at this and you</text>
  <text start="339.3" dur="6.27">can feel it there is something in the</text>
  <text start="342.03" dur="5.94">air there is something and this is a</text>
  <text start="345.57" dur="4.44">star wars reference there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="347.97" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s disturbance in the force I</text>
  <text start="350.01" dur="2.55">didn&amp;#39;t want to say that in the title</text>
  <text start="351.12" dur="4.08">because I don&amp;#39;t know about copyright and</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="3.84">but there&amp;#39;s a disturbance and you feel</text>
  <text start="355.2" dur="6.12">it there&amp;#39;s something just not right</text>
  <text start="356.4" dur="7.29">happening here because pento he likes</text>
  <text start="361.32" dur="5.58">gold but warns of a stark market crash</text>
  <text start="363.69" dur="6.39">and he looked at the goldman sachs</text>
  <text start="366.9" dur="6.69">report and he says there is no</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="6.63">fundamental and there&amp;#39;s no real in</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="6.78">there&amp;#39;s no fundamental factor and no</text>
  <text start="376.71" dur="8.42">evidence of why they think gold is going</text>
  <text start="380.37" dur="7.83">to be bearish now you start to wonder</text>
  <text start="385.13" dur="6.04">did the Fed tell them which they</text>
  <text start="388.2" dur="5.85">probably did ahead of time this is what</text>
  <text start="391.17" dur="6.57">we are going to do we are going to bring</text>
  <text start="394.05" dur="7.41">gold and silver down and this is why</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="5.67">Goldman came out and said we look</text>
  <text start="401.46" dur="3.96">bearish on gold and silver that we</text>
  <text start="403.41" dur="5.34">believe it&amp;#39;s going to drop you know</text>
  <text start="405.42" dur="8.1">under 1500 and by doing</text>
  <text start="408.75" dur="7.17">this they helped bring down the gold</text>
  <text start="413.52" dur="5.22">even more because other people who heard</text>
  <text start="415.92" dur="7.1">this said oh all right I better sell it</text>
  <text start="418.74" dur="7.77">now and people started selling and</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="9.55">McGuire of King World News said there</text>
  <text start="426.51" dur="10.26">was over 500 tons of paper gold sold in</text>
  <text start="432.57" dur="6.6">a takedown today so this was planned</text>
  <text start="436.77" dur="4.2">this is not something where you know</text>
  <text start="439.17" dur="4.11">they had a crystal ball and from all</text>
  <text start="440.97" dur="4.23">their fundamentals and you know and and</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="6.78">all their calculations they came up with</text>
  <text start="445.2" dur="8.36">this they knew what was going on they</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="7.71">knew that this was going to happen and</text>
  <text start="453.56" dur="6.49">basically it it just shook everything</text>
  <text start="457.77" dur="4.2">now the market sound today but really</text>
  <text start="460.05" dur="4.89">thats plastered all over the place that</text>
  <text start="461.97" dur="7.07">you know gold is down it&amp;#39;s below</text>
  <text start="464.94" dur="7.94">fourteen fifteen hundred and but to me</text>
  <text start="469.04" dur="7.96">for all of us that purchase physical</text>
  <text start="472.88" dur="7.539">this was a day that gold and silver went</text>
  <text start="477" dur="6.87">on sale and i say this to people that I</text>
  <text start="480.419" dur="10.261">know my relatives and I use this analogy</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="10.38">if I told you a brand new LED HDTV was</text>
  <text start="490.68" dur="5.61">nine hundred dollars and and well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="494.25" dur="4.41">say let&amp;#39;s do this let&amp;#39;s say it was</text>
  <text start="496.29" dur="6.45">sixteen hundred dollars for this TV and</text>
  <text start="498.66" dur="7.59">now it&amp;#39;s 1400 it&amp;#39;s two hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="502.74" dur="8.429">off the the sticker price what&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="6.71">is people will run to buy the TV because</text>
  <text start="511.169" dur="9.391">it&amp;#39;s two hundred dollars it&amp;#39;s on sale</text>
  <text start="512.96" dur="11.32">now the TV just continuously loses money</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="7.49">it doesn&amp;#39;t retain its value year after</text>
  <text start="524.28" dur="9.39">year it&amp;#39;s worth less and less and less</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="7.65">gold and silver on the other hand goes</text>
  <text start="533.67" dur="2.03">up</text>
  <text start="536.589" dur="7.75">gold and silver are real money the TV</text>
  <text start="542.449" dur="4.11">eventually reaches zero and you end up</text>
  <text start="544.339" dur="5.451">throwing it out does gold and silver</text>
  <text start="546.559" dur="7.551">ever read zero and you throw it out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.79" dur="7.149">we&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed to think like</text>
  <text start="554.11" dur="5.529">this is dropping so I&amp;#39;m losing my money</text>
  <text start="556.939" dur="5.491">but overall if you hold on to your</text>
  <text start="559.639" dur="5.31">physical it will go up because if you</text>
  <text start="562.43" dur="5.339">think about it did for goal to go down</text>
  <text start="564.949" dur="5.731">did the value of the dollar increase so</text>
  <text start="567.769" dur="6.961">much today to make gold and silver go</text>
  <text start="570.68" dur="7.68">down other things are at play here and</text>
  <text start="574.73" dur="7.919">if you look the central bank&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="578.36" dur="9.329">countries were buying gold and silver</text>
  <text start="582.649" dur="8.701">like crazy because the price was pushed</text>
  <text start="587.689" dur="9.181">down and they&amp;#39;re accumulating why all of</text>
  <text start="591.35" dur="9.87">us all of us people who are sleeping are</text>
  <text start="596.87" dur="8.43">like we need to get rid of it or who or</text>
  <text start="601.22" dur="5.339">who are afraid and fear is a terrible</text>
  <text start="605.3" dur="7.289">thing because it makes you do things</text>
  <text start="606.559" dur="11.731">that you normally would not do people</text>
  <text start="612.589" dur="11.34">who are afraid sold and got rid of their</text>
  <text start="618.29" dur="9.239">their medals it&amp;#39;s to me this reminds me</text>
  <text start="623.929" dur="6.21">again of when Goldman Sachs was pushing</text>
  <text start="627.529" dur="4.23">the mortgage-backed securities the news</text>
  <text start="630.139" dur="5.63">was out there telling you to buy your</text>
  <text start="631.759" dur="6.33">home now at the highest price ever and</text>
  <text start="635.769" dur="6.67">everything was pulled out from under you</text>
  <text start="638.089" dur="7.35">and what&amp;#39;s going to happen here is after</text>
  <text start="642.439" dur="5.34">a short period of time when they have no</text>
  <text start="645.439" dur="5.82">more ammunition to push this down</text>
  <text start="647.779" dur="6.961">anymore gold will start rising and those</text>
  <text start="651.259" dur="6.45">people who are holding it will make out</text>
  <text start="654.74" dur="5.13">those people who got rid of it are going</text>
  <text start="657.709" dur="6.75">to kick themselves and say oh crap let</text>
  <text start="659.87" dur="6.26">me get into it now okay so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.459" dur="4.761">move on here</text>
  <text start="666.13" dur="7.77">gun control this to what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="669.22" dur="8.52">today is unbelievable I mean the White</text>
  <text start="673.9" dur="7.2">House today sends a letter not today but</text>
  <text start="677.74" dur="7.44">since send out a letter to on gun</text>
  <text start="681.1" dur="6.3">control asking for support passing the</text>
  <text start="685.18" dur="5.93">executive actions from President Obama</text>
  <text start="687.4" dur="11.69">now they&amp;#39;re using the internet and</text>
  <text start="691.11" dur="12.07">sending emails out to people to support</text>
  <text start="699.09" dur="5.65">gun control they don&amp;#39;t mention the</text>
  <text start="703.18" dur="3.78">Second Amendment they don&amp;#39;t mention</text>
  <text start="704.74" dur="5.55">anything but they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="706.96" dur="6.99">using social media outlets email and the</text>
  <text start="710.29" dur="6.78">internet to get the word out we need to</text>
  <text start="713.95" dur="6.27">do the same thing we need to get</text>
  <text start="717.07" dur="6.48">everyone on board and start talking</text>
  <text start="720.22" dur="6.45">about and making things go viral the</text>
  <text start="723.55" dur="5.04">opposite way because what I&amp;#39;ve noticed</text>
  <text start="726.67" dur="6.71">and I think I mentioned this yesterday</text>
  <text start="728.59" dur="9.72">is that the news the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="733.38" dur="9.4">never mentions the Second Amendment for</text>
  <text start="738.31" dur="9.21">instance Biden gun owners like the way</text>
  <text start="742.78" dur="8.48">it feels it&amp;#39;s like driving a Ferrari now</text>
  <text start="747.52" dur="6.66">he goes on to say certain things here</text>
  <text start="751.26" dur="5.11">you know Vice President Joe Biden this</text>
  <text start="754.18" dur="5.43">morning said that cultural norm about</text>
  <text start="756.37" dur="5.49">gun ownership has changed arguing that</text>
  <text start="759.61" dur="4.59">many people buy guns not for protection</text>
  <text start="761.86" dur="5.46">or hunting but because it&amp;#39;s like driving</text>
  <text start="764.2" dur="5.22">a Ferrari it used to be where we were</text>
  <text start="767.32" dur="5.28">dealing almost exclusively with hunters</text>
  <text start="769.42" dur="6.81">Biden said there&amp;#39;s a whole new sort of</text>
  <text start="772.6" dur="5.58">group of individuals now who I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="776.23" dur="5.04">know what the numbers are that never</text>
  <text start="778.18" dur="6.3">hunt at all but they own guns for one of</text>
  <text start="781.27" dur="6.3">two reasons self-protection were they</text>
  <text start="784.48" dur="6.54">just like the feel of that ar-15 at the</text>

  <text start="799.15" dur="2.28">passionately about</text>
  <text start="799.93" dur="2.88">the need to continue to push for a ban</text>
  <text start="801.43" dur="3.81">on assault-style weapons and</text>
  <text start="802.81" dur="4.89">high-capacity magazine clips saying</text>
  <text start="805.24" dur="5.07">certain weapons of war just don&amp;#39;t belong</text>
  <text start="807.7" dur="5.91">on the street he argued that smaller</text>
  <text start="810.31" dur="7.08">clips would have saved lives in December</text>
