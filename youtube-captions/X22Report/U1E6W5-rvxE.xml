  <text start="67.45" dur="5.7">their dependence on the US dollar let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.02" dur="4.23">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.15" dur="4.71">news now as we&amp;#39;ve been following this</text>
  <text start="75.25" dur="5.61">economy we are starting to see very</text>
  <text start="77.86" dur="4.799">similar patterns not here just in the</text>
  <text start="80.86" dur="3.42">United States but around the world I</text>
  <text start="82.659" dur="4.441">mean if we look at real estate we can</text>
  <text start="84.28" dur="4.199">see there are major problems in all</text>
  <text start="87.1" dur="3.53">different areas not just the United</text>
  <text start="88.479" dur="4.831">States we&amp;#39;re looking at Canada UK</text>
  <text start="90.63" dur="4.989">Australia and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the same</text>
  <text start="93.31" dur="4.8">pattern is evolving in these areas where</text>
  <text start="95.619" dur="4.56">the real estate market well it has been</text>
  <text start="98.11" dur="4.17">blown up into this one gigantic bubble</text>
  <text start="100.179" dur="5.19">and we can see that the bubble is about</text>
  <text start="102.28" dur="5.19">to pop when we look at what retail is</text>
  <text start="105.369" dur="4.351">doing around the different parts of the</text>
  <text start="107.47" dur="4.289">world we can see there&amp;#39;s the exact same</text>
  <text start="109.72" dur="4.86">pattern whether having a problem with</text>
  <text start="111.759" dur="4.86">retail when we look at the unemployment</text>
  <text start="114.58" dur="3.75">numbers we see the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="116.619" dur="3.931">throughout Europe there are many</text>
  <text start="118.33" dur="4.739">countries with very high unemployment</text>
  <text start="120.55" dur="4.679">and if we look at debt well we know that</text>
  <text start="123.069" dur="5.61">debt is pretty much the same almost</text>
  <text start="125.229" dur="5.191">every single place and now in the UK we</text>
  <text start="128.679" dur="5.221">can see that British retail sales well</text>
  <text start="130.42" dur="6.03">they grew a lot more slowly in July well</text>
  <text start="133.9" dur="4.47">than they expected and shoppers now are</text>
  <text start="136.45" dur="4.259">cutting back on non-essential spending</text>
  <text start="138.37" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation in these areas</text>
  <text start="140.709" dur="5.761">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see again the same</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="6.27">pattern in all different areas now here</text>
  <text start="146.47" dur="5.67">in the United States we see that the</text>
  <text start="149.41" dur="5.28">growth of jobs well it has slowed</text>
  <text start="152.14" dur="4.92">dramatically now corporations they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="4.5">out there telling us that they have a</text>
  <text start="157.06" dur="4.44">lot of job openings and I explained this</text>
  <text start="159.19" dur="4.29">once before where a lot of corporations</text>
  <text start="161.5" dur="3.54">they have these open wrecks and they</text>
  <text start="163.48" dur="3.66">interview a lot of people and they say</text>
  <text start="165.04" dur="3.3">well you can&amp;#39;t fill it right now because</text>
  <text start="167.14" dur="3.03">we&amp;#39;re on a freeze now think about these</text>
  <text start="168.34" dur="3.66">corporations yes they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="170.17" dur="4.95">earnings and how earnings are up but</text>
  <text start="172" dur="5.19">sales and revenue well that&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="175.12" dur="4.29">coming in right now and they can&amp;#39;t fudge</text>
  <text start="177.19" dur="3.87">that data so what they&amp;#39;ve been doing is</text>
  <text start="179.41" dur="3.33">this they&amp;#39;ve been using these tricky</text>
  <text start="181.06" dur="4.05">accounting methods they&amp;#39;ve been buying</text>
  <text start="182.74" dur="3.48">back their stock and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="185.11" dur="2.55">see that</text>
  <text start="186.22" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re out there trying to convince</text>
  <text start="187.66" dur="4.62">everyone that they have all these jobs</text>
  <text start="189.73" dur="5.7">these high-paying jobs there&amp;#39;s just no</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="5.73">one to fill these jobs if that is truly</text>
  <text start="195.43" dur="6.75">the case we have all these college</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="6.3">graduates kind of coming out of school</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re graduating they can&amp;#39;t find jobs</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="6.33">they have these huge student loan bills</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="5.22">that are due we also have something like</text>
  <text start="210.64" dur="4.53">a hundred million people that have</text>
  <text start="213.01" dur="4.17">fallen off the job market and all the</text>
  <text start="215.17" dur="5.04">jobs that are being added to the economy</text>
  <text start="217.18" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re all part-time waiter waitresses</text>
  <text start="220.21" dur="6.18">you&amp;#39;re trying to tell me there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="6.12">nobody out there who wants a job now</text>
  <text start="226.39" dur="5.22">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is that these</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="4.59">corporations they&amp;#39;re really not making</text>
  <text start="231.61" dur="3.96">the revenue they&amp;#39;re really not making</text>
  <text start="232.96" dur="5.22">the sales out there and we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="235.57" dur="8.22">seeing a decline in the annual growth</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="8.88">rate from 6.2 in May to 3.5% in June the</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="5.43">hires rate was 3.7 percent the number of</text>
  <text start="247.06" dur="4.5">hires was little change for total</text>
  <text start="249.22" dur="4.769">private and for government and the</text>
  <text start="251.56" dur="5.04">number of hires well it is decreasing</text>
  <text start="253.989" dur="6.331">now we&amp;#39;ve seen this pattern before if we</text>
  <text start="256.6" dur="6.36">go back to 2006 2007 all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="260.32" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re seeing that we&amp;#39;ve hit this height</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="4.92">where all of a sudden we you know the</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="5.16">pace of hiring slowed and then it</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="4.41">started to fall and all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="270.52" dur="4.35">entered a recession so we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="272.29" dur="5.55">same exact pattern that we once saw now</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="5.1">if we look at something very very</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="6.3">closely here and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="279.97" dur="6.99">US credit card debt now in troubled</text>
  <text start="284.14" dur="4.35">times people like to use their credit</text>
  <text start="286.96" dur="3.48">cards because they don&amp;#39;t have the income</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="4.11">coming in they can&amp;#39;t find those</text>
  <text start="290.44" dur="4.26">high-paying jobs they might have one or</text>
  <text start="292.6" dur="5.04">two part-time jobs and they start using</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="5.91">their credit cards to make ends meet now</text>
  <text start="297.64" dur="6.18">the Federal Reserve they confirmed that</text>
  <text start="300.61" dur="7.7">as the end of June total revolving</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="8.34">credit card debt rose to one trillion</text>
  <text start="308.31" dur="6.64">dollars an increase of 4.1 billion on</text>
  <text start="312.16" dur="5.91">the month this is an all-time new high</text>
  <text start="314.95" dur="4.92">taking up the previous record high set</text>
  <text start="318.07" dur="4.23">during the summer of</text>
  <text start="319.87" dur="4.98">thousand eight and what happened in</text>
  <text start="322.3" dur="4.77">October of 2008 well everything</text>
  <text start="324.85" dur="4.83">completely fell apart now when we take a</text>
  <text start="327.07" dur="6.81">closer look at the quarterly update a</text>
  <text start="329.68" dur="6.66">noun non revolving debt we find that for</text>
  <text start="333.88" dur="5.1">another consecutive quarter both student</text>
  <text start="336.34" dur="6.09">and auto loans hit a record-high</text>
  <text start="338.98" dur="7.35">of one point four five zero trillion and</text>
  <text start="342.43" dur="5.61">one point 131 trillion and we need to</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="5.13">remember something very important here</text>
  <text start="348.04" dur="6.33">in order for the Federal Reserve to</text>
  <text start="351.46" dur="5.31">continually to push their agenda I mean</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="6.27">every single central bank their agenda</text>
  <text start="356.77" dur="6.69">is debt they want everyone to take on</text>
  <text start="360.64" dur="5.91">more and more debt this is part of their</text>
  <text start="363.46" dur="4.77">system and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="366.55" dur="5.13">been seeing over the last eight years</text>
  <text start="368.23" dur="5.76">think about it they push the debt to the</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="5.66">extreme right now in credit cards an</text>
  <text start="373.99" dur="7.47">auto loan student loan in mortgages in</text>
  <text start="377.34" dur="6.85">global debt and when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="381.46" dur="5.19">can see that if this economy is at full</text>
  <text start="384.19" dur="4.2">employment and everything is and</text>
  <text start="386.65" dur="5.13">everyone is doing well and everyone has</text>
  <text start="388.39" dur="4.8">these fantastic jobs we wouldn&amp;#39;t see all</text>
  <text start="391.78" dur="3.93">of this we wouldn&amp;#39;t see the</text>
  <text start="393.19" dur="5.58">delinquencies we wouldn&amp;#39;t see all this</text>
  <text start="395.71" dur="7.62">debt being loaded up on but when people</text>
  <text start="398.77" dur="7.35">don&amp;#39;t have the money they resort to debt</text>
  <text start="403.33" dur="5.19">to support their daily lives and this is</text>
  <text start="406.12" dur="5.43">exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing now we know</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="4.89">that the central bank the Fed they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="411.55" dur="3.99">done these stress tests and they found</text>
  <text start="413.41" dur="4.2">it don&amp;#39;t worry the US commercial banks</text>
  <text start="415.54" dur="4.23">they have enough capital to survive even</text>
  <text start="417.61" dur="4.77">an adverse stress scenario now we know</text>
  <text start="419.77" dur="5.85">these tests are completely fake phony</text>
  <text start="422.38" dur="7.49">and false but what they did find out is</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="7.32">that the two big US mortgage giants well</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="4.51">they didn&amp;#39;t do so well and Fannie Mae</text>
  <text start="432.94" dur="3.12">and Freddie Mac they really they</text>
  <text start="434.38" dur="4.86">released today by their regulators that</text>
  <text start="436.06" dur="6.57">they are going to be in a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="439.24" dur="6.09">trouble if we enter another crisis</text>
  <text start="442.63" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re going to need a hundred billion</text>
  <text start="445.33" dur="5.55">dollars in bailout funding if there is</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="4.56">some type of economic crisis now we know</text>
  <text start="450.88" dur="2.88">there&amp;#39;s an economic crisis coming we</text>
  <text start="452.92" dur="3.75">know there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="453.76" dur="4.8">problems and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="456.67" dur="4.29">if the housing Mart&amp;#39;s market starts to</text>
  <text start="458.56" dur="4.74">decline or if we enter a global</text>
  <text start="460.96" dur="4.23">recession believe me it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="463.3" dur="4.13">be a hundred billion it&amp;#39;s most likely</text>
  <text start="465.19" dur="5.61">going to be about five times that amount</text>
  <text start="467.43" dur="4.51">because this is what we saw back in 2008</text>
  <text start="470.8" dur="3.6">remember said when they said Oh</text>
  <text start="471.94" dur="4.2">AIG is only going to need one bailout oh</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re just going to need this small</text>
  <text start="476.14" dur="4.77">little bailout for all the banks and it</text>
  <text start="479.05" dur="3.87">the number kept on going up and up and</text>
  <text start="480.91" dur="5.7">up and then we realized that the Fed</text>
  <text start="482.92" dur="6.3">covertly has been giving bailout in the</text>
  <text start="486.61" dur="5.16">trillions too many banks around the</text>
  <text start="489.22" dur="5.27">world so we know that&amp;#39;s completely fake</text>
  <text start="491.77" dur="5.52">phony and false we also know that</text>
  <text start="494.49" dur="6.55">corporations are in trouble actually the</text>
  <text start="497.29" dur="6.18">corporate leverage has never been higher</text>
  <text start="501.04" dur="6">right now the ratio is at the highest</text>
  <text start="503.47" dur="7.62">point since the financial crisis again</text>
  <text start="507.04" dur="7.02">this is a major problem and when we</text>
  <text start="511.09" dur="4.98">start to look at the entire economy</text>
  <text start="514.06" dur="4.62">right now we can see from all these</text>
  <text start="516.07" dur="4.71">economic indicators that there are major</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="4.68">problems there are problems all over the</text>
  <text start="520.78" dur="5.16">place and the central banks they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="523.36" dur="5.88">busy in the last eight years or so they</text>
  <text start="525.94" dur="5.79">just been covering up every single part</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="5.16">of it to make sure that everyone doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="531.73" dur="5.7">realize what is really happening right</text>
  <text start="534.4" dur="6.06">now think about all the things that</text>
  <text start="537.43" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;ve discussed already the federal tax</text>
  <text start="540.46" dur="4.89">receipts declining the state tax</text>
  <text start="542.32" dur="5.58">receipts declining corporate debt rising</text>
  <text start="545.35" dur="5.63">we see that the corporation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.9" dur="6.72">leveraged like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="550.98" dur="6.37">delinquencies are rising the debt load</text>
  <text start="554.62" dur="5.43">on individuals using credit cards auto</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="5.04">loans student loans the highest we have</text>
  <text start="560.05" dur="4.59">ever seen unemployment rate is</text>
  <text start="562.39" dur="4.35">completely manipulated and there are so</text>
  <text start="564.64" dur="4.29">many people out of the workforce it is</text>
  <text start="566.74" dur="4.71">absolutely ridiculous and we see</text>
  <text start="568.93" dur="5.07">countries around the world where they</text>
  <text start="571.45" dur="5.07">are separating themselves from the</text>
  <text start="574" dur="3.45">dollar slowly but surely they are doing</text>
  <text start="576.52" dur="2.4">this and they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for</text>
  <text start="577.45" dur="4.14">quite a while and they&amp;#39;ve been ramping</text>
  <text start="578.92" dur="5.07">up on gold now Russia has decided</text>
  <text start="581.59" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re going to speed up work on</text>
  <text start="583.99" dur="3.49">reducing its dependent on the US</text>
  <text start="586.84" dur="3.34">payments</text>
  <text start="587.48" dur="4.52">systems and the dollar so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="590.18" dur="5.07">going to be using the dollar as the</text>
  <text start="592" dur="5.32">settling currency anymore now this is</text>
  <text start="595.25" dur="5.18">coming from Deputy Foreign Minister</text>
  <text start="597.32" dur="5.79">Sergei Ryabkov he said we will of course</text>
  <text start="600.43" dur="5.32">intensify work related to import</text>
  <text start="603.11" dur="4.89">substitution reduction of dependence on</text>
  <text start="605.75" dur="4.8">US payment systems on the dollar as they</text>
  <text start="608" dur="5.31">settle in currency and so on it is B it</text>
  <text start="610.55" dur="4.289">is becoming a vital need the reason for</text>
  <text start="613.31" dur="3.75">that is that the u.s. is using the</text>
  <text start="614.839" dur="4.5">dominating role in the monetary and</text>
  <text start="617.06" dur="4.17">financial system to impose pressure on</text>
  <text start="619.339" dur="5.041">foreign business including Russian</text>
  <text start="621.23" dur="4.979">companies now they&amp;#39;ve been doing this</text>
  <text start="624.38" dur="4.5">way before the sanctions but they</text>
  <text start="626.209" dur="4.291">decided to speed it up because they want</text>
  <text start="628.88" dur="4.17">to be separate and apart from the dollar</text>
  <text start="630.5" dur="5.1">because if they end up doing this which</text>
  <text start="633.05" dur="4.14">they are doing these sanctions are going</text>
  <text start="635.6" dur="4.59">to be meaningless now think about this</text>
  <text start="637.19" dur="5.1">for a second China is working with many</text>
  <text start="640.19" dur="5.82">different countries around the world for</text>

  <text start="667.01" dur="7.259">the dollar well it&amp;#39;s coming to an end</text>
  <text start="671.63" dur="6.209">this is why all of this is happening</text>
  <text start="674.269" dur="5.791">right now because this fight system that</text>
  <text start="677.839" dur="4.86">has been running on the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="680.06" dur="4.139">which they&amp;#39;re dependent on oil is coming</text>
  <text start="682.699" dur="4.591">to an end look what&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="684.199" dur="6.991">Middle East right now the empire</text>
  <text start="687.29" dur="6.989">building of the deep state well that has</text>
  <text start="691.19" dur="6.12">gone nowhere actually it&amp;#39;s all reversing</text>
  <text start="694.279" dur="5.31">right now and it&amp;#39;s falling apart which</text>
  <text start="697.31" dur="4.74">means all these countries they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="699.589" dur="4.62">going to keep the dollar anymore they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="3.719">going to look someplace else these</text>
  <text start="704.209" dur="4.911">countries are going to make deals on</text>
  <text start="705.769" dur="7.021">selling their oil not using the dollar</text>
  <text start="709.12" dur="5.86">remember back in 71 Kissinger went out</text>
  <text start="712.79" dur="6.63">there and he established this entire</text>
  <text start="714.98" dur="5.39">plan this plan is at its end stage right</text>
  <text start="719.42" dur="3.14">now</text>
  <text start="720.37" dur="5.25">this is what happens during a transition</text>
  <text start="722.56" dur="5.94">and as we move through this transition</text>
  <text start="725.62" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s going to get worse before it gets a</text>
  <text start="728.5" dur="4.62">lot better this is why we&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="730.99" dur="3.96">get prepared get ready make sure you</text>
  <text start="733.12" dur="3.78">have your food make sure you have your</text>
  <text start="734.95" dur="3.87">water make sure you have your toilet</text>
  <text start="736.9" dur="3.39">supplies make sure you have gold and</text>
  <text start="738.82" dur="3.54">silver make sure you have cash on hand</text>
  <text start="740.29" dur="4.53">now the reason why we&amp;#39;re saying all of</text>
  <text start="742.36" dur="4.68">this is because not because it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="744.82" dur="5.04">to be a Mad Max an area now there might</text>
  <text start="747.04" dur="5.28">be certain areas where it gets out of</text>
  <text start="749.86" dur="5.31">hand maybe in the big cities and those</text>
  <text start="752.32" dur="6.18">congested areas the reason why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="755.17" dur="6.57">really saying is is because as inflation</text>
  <text start="758.5" dur="5.22">hits and as people become desperate you</text>
  <text start="761.74" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t want to be running to the market</text>
  <text start="763.72" dur="3.54">to try to figure out what you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="765.49" dur="4.02">to do what your game plan is going to be</text>
  <text start="767.26" dur="4.65">you rather be prepared to say you know</text>
  <text start="769.51" dur="4.68">something I don&amp;#39;t need to go into those</text>
  <text start="771.91" dur="4.11">crowds right now I don&amp;#39;t have to fight</text>
  <text start="774.19" dur="4.35">for the food I don&amp;#39;t have to fight for</text>
  <text start="776.02" dur="4.89">the water and as we go through the</text>
  <text start="778.54" dur="3.84">transition and things get worse you</text>
  <text start="780.91" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it you can</text>
  <text start="782.38" dur="4.56">sustain yourself for a certain period of</text>
  <text start="784.72" dur="3.96">time and if you have cash on hand you</text>
  <text start="786.94" dur="4.019">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about that bank</text>
  <text start="788.68" dur="4.44">holiday where the banks close down and</text>
  <text start="790.959" dur="4.32">and they tell you and this happened in</text>
  <text start="793.12" dur="3.69">Cyprus happen in Greece happen in many</text>
  <text start="795.279" dur="3.151">different areas where they said listen</text>
  <text start="796.81" dur="4.14">you&amp;#39;re only allowed to withdraw this</text>
  <text start="798.43" dur="4.14">amount of funds you can&amp;#39;t transfer your</text>
  <text start="800.95" dur="3.6">funds outside of the country</text>
  <text start="802.57" dur="3.86">you can&amp;#39;t do anything like that so you</text>
  <text start="804.55" dur="4.44">need to use your cash on hand in the</text>
  <text start="806.43" dur="6.27">beginning stage and as we go through</text>
  <text start="808.99" dur="6.66">this transition and the currency is</text>
  <text start="812.7" dur="4.24">going you know it is in this transition</text>
  <text start="815.65" dur="4.77">state where we&amp;#39;re moving to a different</text>
  <text start="816.94" dur="5.94">currency you need to ensure your wealth</text>
  <text start="820.42" dur="3.93">how do you do this well some people are</text>
  <text start="822.88" dur="2.579">saying cryptocurrency I still believe</text>
  <text start="824.35" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s gold and silver because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="825.459" dur="6.151">physical it maintains it sustains its</text>
  <text start="828.43" dur="5.04">value over a period of time this is</text>
  <text start="831.61" dur="4.02">going back thousands and thousands of</text>
  <text start="833.47" dur="4.17">years you can try it with crypto that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="835.63" dur="5.07">not that&amp;#39;s something that you might want</text>
  <text start="837.64" dur="5.34">to have in your you know portfolio to</text>
  <text start="840.7" dur="3.75">ensure your wealth but I would say gold</text>
