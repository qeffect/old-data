  <text start="60.93" dur="6.27">are starting to get fed up with the</text>
  <text start="64.35" dur="5.25">government and their lives and again</text>

  <text start="72.06" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re pissed off that&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="73.469" dur="5.82">what&amp;#39;s happening and thousands of people</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="6.299">in spain right now are set to protest</text>
  <text start="79.289" dur="5.22">austerity they claim is destroying their</text>
  <text start="82.049" dur="5.041">country under the banner of no more cuts</text>
  <text start="84.509" dur="5.97">the protesters are calling for an end to</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="5.61">spanish government&amp;#39;s empty promises and</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="4.051">again these protesters are out there and</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="4.44">of course the government&amp;#39;s are always</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="5.009">telling us how great everything is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="97.14" dur="3.96">in a recovery we heard this from the</text>
  <text start="99.539" dur="4.11">president of France we heard it from</text>
  <text start="101.1" dur="5.25">Spain we hear it from Italy we hear it</text>
  <text start="103.649" dur="4.83">from Greece and again you can just do</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="5.399">this for so long until the people say</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="5.371">you know what I think you&amp;#39;re lying to us</text>
  <text start="111.749" dur="4.47">at this point and some of the protesters</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="5.159">in here this is what they&amp;#39;re saying why</text>
  <text start="116.219" dur="5.341">am I here I am sick of this government</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="4.951">with all the promises they never fulfill</text>
  <text start="121.56" dur="5.4">they said they were going to create more</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="5.37">jobs and lower the taxes but it&amp;#39;s a lie</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="5.37">instead unemployment rose from four to</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="4.739">six million this is the only way we can</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="4.379">fight back and this is coming from one</text>
  <text start="134.069" dur="5.7">of the protesters and again they this</text>
  <text start="136.709" dur="4.081">goes on to say that hundreds of people</text>
  <text start="139.769" dur="4.05">are being evicted</text>
  <text start="140.79" dur="4.619">from their homes every day in Spain and</text>
  <text start="143.819" dur="4.321">at the beginning of the month the</text>
  <text start="145.409" dur="4.95">Spanish minister of employment said that</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="4.709">Spain had finally pulled itself out of</text>
  <text start="150.359" dur="4.74">the recession and registered economic</text>
  <text start="152.849" dur="5.371">growth and again what are the people</text>
  <text start="155.099" dur="7.86">hearing their hearing propaganda they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.22" dur="8.25">hearing lies because you know when you</text>
  <text start="162.959" dur="6.84">are in a recovery you feel it people get</text>
  <text start="166.47" dur="7.169">jobs businesses open you have more money</text>
  <text start="169.799" dur="5.491">you exactly know what it feels like you</text>
  <text start="173.639" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t need the government to tell you</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="5.789">that your inner recovery over and over</text>
  <text start="177.599" dur="5.76">and over that is a lie to make you think</text>
  <text start="181.079" dur="5.701">that they&amp;#39;re doing something but they</text>
  <text start="183.359" dur="5.46">aren&amp;#39;t there making it worse now Spain</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="4.109">is not the only area that seeing</text>
  <text start="188.819" dur="3.39">problems I mean we&amp;#39;re in the UK we</text>
  <text start="190.889" dur="4.32">understand that people are taking out</text>
  <text start="192.209" dur="4.471">payday loans to pay for their mortgages</text>
  <text start="195.209" dur="4.081">to make ends meet they&amp;#39;re dipping into</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="5.91">their savings and right now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="6.15">seeing is they&amp;#39;re seeing a huge amount</text>
  <text start="202.59" dur="5.22">of graduates in the UK around forty five</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="4.199">percent who cannot pay back their</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="4.019">student loans and hey we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="209.639" dur="3.78">here in the United States also this is</text>
  <text start="211.829" dur="4.62">happening pretty much everywhere why</text>
  <text start="213.419" dur="5.551">because there are no jobs out there and</text>
  <text start="216.449" dur="5.671">right now in a dramatic reassessment of</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="4.799">UK Stein students finance the government</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="4.5">estimates around forty five percent of</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="5.671">graduates will be on unable to pay their</text>
  <text start="226.62" dur="5.039">loans back labor shadow university</text>
  <text start="229.44" dur="4.109">minister told the BBC that the latest</text>
  <text start="231.659" dur="4.58">figures are evidence that the new system</text>
  <text start="233.549" dur="5.881">has made no difference to students</text>
  <text start="236.239" dur="6.271">whatsoever so few students can afford to</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="6.029">ever pay back their student loans and</text>
  <text start="242.51" dur="4.569">again what did what do they think is</text>
  <text start="245.459" dur="3.42">happening here and of course the</text>
  <text start="247.079" dur="3.75">government is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.879" dur="5.28">saying that you know the unemployment at</text>
  <text start="250.829" dur="4.77">7.2 percent it&amp;#39;s standing at 7.2 but if</text>
  <text start="254.159" dur="4.14">you look at the youth unemployment it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.599" dur="3.871">much larger at 19.8 and of course these</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="3.541">numbers are coming out of the government</text>
  <text start="259.47" dur="4.11">and you can just imagine just like</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="4.5">everywhere else it&amp;#39;s probably a lot</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="4.98">worse again if you cannot find work and</text>
  <text start="266.34" dur="6.21">make the income you will not be able to</text>
  <text start="268.56" dur="6.21">pay this type of debt back and of course</text>
  <text start="272.55" dur="3.72">all these government&amp;#39;s realizes</text>
  <text start="274.77" dur="3.48">they realize that all of this debt</text>
  <text start="276.27" dur="4.56">cannot be sustained so what do they do</text>
  <text start="278.25" dur="4.889">what is it every single country do they</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="4.649">implement more taxes on the people and</text>
  <text start="283.139" dur="5.34">what are we seeing right now well I ms</text>
  <text start="285.479" dur="4.711">property tax hike proposal is going to</text>
  <text start="288.479" dur="4.801">come true in the UK and they always</text>
  <text start="290.19" dur="4.92">start with the wealthy and then they</text>
  <text start="293.28" dur="3.87">work their way down this is what happens</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="4.5">they say okay we&amp;#39;re only going to tax</text>
  <text start="297.15" dur="4.65">the wealthy and all the poor the middle</text>
  <text start="299.61" dur="4.23">class say yeah it&amp;#39;s not us let the</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="4.98">wealthy should pay for it but what</text>
  <text start="303.84" dur="5.85">happens is they do this in the beginning</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.83">and then it trickles down to the middle</text>
  <text start="309.69" dur="4.949">class it trickles down to the poor and</text>
  <text start="311.61" dur="4.589">this way everyone ends up paying and</text>
  <text start="314.639" dur="4.02">right now what they&amp;#39;re looking to do is</text>
  <text start="316.199" dur="6.391">they&amp;#39;re trying they&amp;#39;re going to levy</text>
  <text start="318.659" dur="7.201">some taxes on a movable property they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="322.59" dur="5.28">going to tax people on homes and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="3.839">looking to do this pretty much on the</text>
  <text start="327.87" dur="3.99">wealthy at this point and this goes on</text>
  <text start="329.699" dur="4.68">to say that wealth taxes of various</text>
  <text start="331.86" dur="5.97">kinds target the same underlying base as</text>
  <text start="334.379" dur="5.371">capital income taxes namely assets they</text>
  <text start="337.83" dur="3.619">could thus be considered as a potential</text>
  <text start="339.75" dur="4.11">source of progressive taxation</text>
  <text start="341.449" dur="5.65">especially where taxes on capital</text>
  <text start="343.86" dur="4.859">incomes are low or largely evaded there</text>
  <text start="347.099" dur="4.021">are different types of well taxes such</text>
  <text start="348.719" dur="5.161">as recurrent taxes on property or net</text>
  <text start="351.12" dur="5.519">wealth transaction taxes and inheritance</text>
  <text start="353.88" dur="4.289">and gift taxes and we are seeing this in</text>
  <text start="356.639" dur="3.21">many different countries I mean France</text>
  <text start="358.169" dur="4.47">started to do this or taxing the wealthy</text>
  <text start="359.849" dur="4.891">had a very very high tax rate and then</text>
  <text start="362.639" dur="3.9">eventually what happens it goes to the</text>
  <text start="364.74" dur="3.69">middle it then it ends up with the poor</text>
  <text start="366.539" dur="4.051">we see this in the United States the</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="4.68">wealthy are being taxed more right now</text>
  <text start="370.59" dur="4.829">and this will trickle down to the rest</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="5.73">of the people because again we have to</text>
  <text start="375.419" dur="5.31">think back in time when the government</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="3.569">said they&amp;#39;ll be imposing taxes and they</text>
  <text start="380.729" dur="3.72">only impose taxes on the wealthy the</text>
  <text start="382.409" dur="3.391">rest of the country had no taxes and</text>
  <text start="384.449" dur="3.78">then eventually what happened was oh</text>
  <text start="385.8" dur="4.649">well now we have to do the middle class</text>
  <text start="388.229" dur="4.171">now we have to do the poor app basically</text>
  <text start="390.449" dur="3.69">you know what everyone needs to be taxed</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="3.93">at this point and this is how they do it</text>
  <text start="394.139" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s very incremental they take their</text>
  <text start="396.33" dur="5.73">time and they do it and it sneaks up on</text>
  <text start="399.659" dur="5.76">everyone and no one realizes what is</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="5.17">happening now I talk about real estate</text>
  <text start="405.419" dur="3.401">quite a bit and we</text>
  <text start="407.23" dur="4.05">understand that it is completely</text>
  <text start="408.82" dur="5.34">imploding on itself and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="4.83">seeing right now is let&amp;#39;s I mean let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.16" dur="7.02">take a look at the u.s. home ownership</text>
  <text start="416.11" dur="8.85">rate at this point now from 1986 to</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="6.15">about 1994 home ownership was around</text>
  <text start="424.96" dur="5.34">sixty three point eight percent or so</text>
  <text start="427.33" dur="7.83">it&amp;#39;s a pretty steady and then in 1994</text>
  <text start="430.3" dur="9.3">all of a sudden it shot up and from 1994</text>
  <text start="435.16" dur="7.77">all the way to 2008 it reached a level</text>
  <text start="439.6" dur="7.86">of around sixty nine point five percent</text>
  <text start="442.93" dur="9.06">but since 2008 home ownership has been</text>
  <text start="447.46" dur="6.87">declining Americans do not own homes a</text>
  <text start="451.99" dur="6.42">one from sixty nine point five percent</text>
  <text start="454.33" dur="7.47">we are now at sixty-five percent at the</text>
  <text start="458.41" dur="6.36">end of 2013 and it&amp;#39;s continually heading</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="6.27">down pretty soon we&amp;#39;re going to be at</text>
  <text start="464.77" dur="6.75">levels back to nineteen eighty six this</text>
  <text start="468.07" dur="5.7">is not good for the economy most of</text>
  <text start="471.52" dur="4.77">these homes are in foreclosure they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="473.77" dur="4.5">empty and again we understand the hedge</text>
  <text start="476.29" dur="3.87">funds the investment companies are now</text>
  <text start="478.27" dur="3.96">even to trying to unload their</text>
  <text start="480.16" dur="7.29">properties because they realize this</text>
  <text start="482.23" dur="7.17">bubble is about to burst okay now we</text>
  <text start="487.45" dur="4.2">understand that when this collapse</text>
  <text start="489.4" dur="3.9">happens nobody&amp;#39;s money is going to be</text>
  <text start="491.65" dur="2.94">safe in the banks and we realize this is</text>
  <text start="493.3" dur="6.99">why they created all these bail and</text>
  <text start="494.59" dur="8.22">documents well the EU agrees on balance</text>
  <text start="500.29" dur="5.22">and this goes on to say that European</text>
  <text start="502.81" dur="5.85">Union politicians struck a deal on</text>
  <text start="505.51" dur="8.13">legislation to create a single agency to</text>
  <text start="508.66" dur="8.1">handle failing bakes and balance in the</text>
  <text start="513.64" dur="4.62">eurozone negotiators persuaded nations</text>
  <text start="516.76" dur="3.6">that had been opposed to the proposed</text>
  <text start="518.26" dur="4.95">single resolution mechanism and the</text>
  <text start="520.36" dur="5.04">legislation for balance to agree in</text>
  <text start="523.21" dur="4.38">Salvin banks will be treated equally</text>
  <text start="525.4" dur="6.26">regardless of the country they are based</text>
  <text start="527.59" dur="7.44">in fail banks creditors both holders and</text>
  <text start="531.66" dur="6.64">depositors will be subject to balance in</text>
  <text start="535.03" dur="5.97">the same way in every single country</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s a very good agreement</text>
  <text start="541" dur="4.05">the European Central Bank President</text>
  <text start="542.53" dur="5.28">Mario Draghi said before the meeting of</text>
  <text start="545.05" dur="4.29">the EU leaders in Belgium capital of</text>
  <text start="547.81" dur="3.21">course it is a great agreement because</text>
  <text start="549.34" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re going to be stealing your money</text>
  <text start="551.02" dur="6.24">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s great and this continues</text>
  <text start="554.62" dur="4.53">on it says it had already been agreed</text>
  <text start="557.26" dur="4.77">that shareholders and importantly now</text>
  <text start="559.15" dur="5.46">depositors we build in before the single</text>
  <text start="562.03" dur="5.67">resolution can be tapped about a hundred</text>
  <text start="564.61" dur="5.55">bank plus trends transnationals and</text>
  <text start="567.7" dur="4.62">those already bailed out will come under</text>
  <text start="570.16" dur="4.38">the direct supervision of the ECB from</text>
  <text start="572.32" dur="4.59">january banks in the eurozone remain</text>
  <text start="574.54" dur="4.23">extremely vulnerable of course we all</text>
  <text start="576.91" dur="5.22">understand this that these bangs can</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="5.61">fail at any second and our research on</text>
  <text start="582.13" dur="4.56">balance and the developing ballon</text>
  <text start="584.38" dur="4.86">regimes clearly shows how banks remain</text>
  <text start="586.69" dur="5.04">very vulnerable and it is now the case</text>
  <text start="589.24" dur="6.33">that in the event of bank failure your</text>
  <text start="591.73" dur="8.34">deposits could be confiscated the same</text>
  <text start="595.57" dur="8.07">way it happened in Cyprus so right now</text>
  <text start="600.07" dur="6.96">we should be getting prepared for this</text>
  <text start="603.64" dur="6.3">don&amp;#39;t and this is my opinion and this is</text>
  <text start="607.03" dur="5.94">what I do I only keep a certain amount</text>
  <text start="609.94" dur="5.55">in the bank to pay my bills the rest is</text>
  <text start="612.97" dur="5.4">not there because i am not going to get</text>
  <text start="615.49" dur="5.16">caught while they put they implement</text>
  <text start="618.37" dur="4.71">these ballons and they implement a bank</text>
  <text start="620.65" dur="3.93">holiday and then capital controls and</text>
  <text start="623.08" dur="2.55">even though they&amp;#39;re going to tell you</text>
  <text start="624.58" dur="3.93">that they&amp;#39;re going to it&amp;#39;s only for a</text>
  <text start="625.63" dur="4.59">week or two we know this is going to be</text>
  <text start="628.51" dur="3.63">completely false because just take a</text>
  <text start="630.22" dur="3.57">look at Cypress it&amp;#39;s been over a year</text>
  <text start="632.14" dur="2.85">and now they&amp;#39;re saying late spring</text>
  <text start="633.79" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re going to remove the capital</text>
  <text start="634.99" dur="5.79">controls and I&amp;#39;m going to bet you that</text>
  <text start="637" dur="5.88">they probably will not do this again if</text>
  <text start="640.78" dur="4.68">everything collapses it will matter at</text>
  <text start="642.88" dur="6.24">all at that point at that in at that</text>
  <text start="645.46" dur="5.76">point now here&amp;#39;s some good news the</text>

  <text start="897.18" dur="5.31">the people actually decide and you have</text>
  <text start="899.55" dur="4.8">to remember the government that is in</text>

  <text start="915.089" dur="3.541">they pick them out beforehand and this</text>
  <text start="917.459" dur="3.691">is why they&amp;#39;re not having elections</text>
  <text start="918.63" dur="4.62">right now because if they had elections</text>
  <text start="921.15" dur="3.689">they might not be in office and they</text>

  <text start="936.839" dur="3.541">were no elections but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="938.79" dur="3.18">right now in the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="940.38" dur="4.23">telling us that you know</text>
  <text start="941.97" dur="5.64">Pro Russian troops invaded the bases and</text>
  <text start="944.61" dur="6.36">they made people you know they captured</text>
  <text start="947.61" dur="5.13">the the bases and they made people come</text>
  <text start="950.97" dur="4.95">over to their side and what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="952.74" dur="5.19">is nothing like that whatsoever only</text>
  <text start="955.92" dur="5.519">eleven percent of Ukrainian soldiers</text>
  <text start="957.93" dur="5.43">opted to quit Crimea only about a 9th of</text>
  <text start="961.439" dur="3.991">Ukrainian military personnel currently</text>
  <text start="963.36" dur="4.2">doing service in Crimea have made a</text>
  <text start="965.43" dur="4.889">decision to leave the peninsula and go</text>
  <text start="967.56" dur="5.31">back to Ukraine and as a March 21st less</text>
  <text start="970.319" dur="5.611">than two thousand out of the 18,000</text>
  <text start="972.87" dur="4.529">soldiers of Ukrainian military forces or</text>
  <text start="975.93" dur="4.949">currently stationed in the Republic of</text>
  <text start="977.399" dur="7.17">Crimea I wish to leave for Ukraine so</text>
  <text start="980.879" dur="5.851">again they see this happening where most</text>
  <text start="984.569" dur="6">of the people are staying with Russia</text>
  <text start="986.73" dur="5.729">Crimea you know there&amp;#39;s a two thousand</text>
  <text start="990.569" dur="3.661">or so going back to Ukraine but what</text>
  <text start="992.459" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re losing their</text>
  <text start="994.23" dur="4.229">armed forces and this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="996.629" dur="3.69">been building the national guard up this</text>
  <text start="998.459" dur="4.261">is why they&amp;#39;re trying to get anyone they</text>
  <text start="1000.319" dur="4.2">possibly can and they&amp;#39;re actually losing</text>
  <text start="1002.72" dur="3.239">the battle and then you know their backs</text>
  <text start="1004.519" dur="4.021">are against the wall there putting these</text>
  <text start="1005.959" dur="4.8">ridiculous sanctions on Russia that have</text>
  <text start="1008.54" dur="3.599">that that are only on individuals not on</text>
  <text start="1010.759" dur="3.661">the country because they&amp;#39;re afraid to do</text>
  <text start="1012.139" dur="5.461">it on the country and if they actually</text>
  <text start="1014.42" dur="5.609">do it on Russia you know I&amp;#39;ve discussed</text>
  <text start="1017.6" dur="4.5">as many times they might actually end up</text>
  <text start="1020.029" dur="3.691">doing it just so they can blame them for</text>
  <text start="1022.1" dur="5.01">the collapse but we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="1023.72" dur="5.729">that goes and this report went on to say</text>
  <text start="1027.11" dur="4.439">that Russia&amp;#39;s Defense Minister Sergei</text>
  <text start="1029.449" dur="4.89">has ordered the black sea Davey to</text>
  <text start="1031.549" dur="5.701">provide safe passage to Ukraine to those</text>
  <text start="1034.339" dur="5.311">soldiers who made a decision to do so so</text>
  <text start="1037.25" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re saying listen we&amp;#39;ll help</text>
  <text start="1039.65" dur="3.96">you with your families we&amp;#39;ll get you out</text>
  <text start="1041.36" dur="6.03">of here and you can go back to Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1043.61" dur="7.799">if that is your choice okay now we</text>
  <text start="1047.39" dur="7.35">understand in Syria that they are now</text>
  <text start="1051.409" dur="4.561">building up military force in Jordan and</text>
  <text start="1054.74" dur="3.96">they have soldiers there they have</text>
  <text start="1055.97" dur="3.93">military assets there if cencom which is</text>
  <text start="1058.7" dur="3.99">an underground base where they have</text>
  <text start="1059.9" dur="4.68">military officers all ready for this</text>
  <text start="1062.69" dur="3.21">invasion into Syria they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1064.58" dur="4.56">building this up it&amp;#39;s been very quiet</text>
  <text start="1065.9" dur="5.85">and every so often they let they try to</text>
  <text start="1069.14" dur="5.7">get they try to sneak soldiers through</text>
  <text start="1071.75" dur="4.11">into Syria and they could either be hit</text>
  <text start="1074.84" dur="3.27">squads to take</text>
  <text start="1075.86" dur="4.62">Assad or they could be setting up or</text>
  <text start="1078.11" dur="5.64">trying to do something tactical before</text>
  <text start="1080.48" dur="6.48">the invasion but again as troops crossed</text>
  <text start="1083.75" dur="5.52">from Jordan into Syria they were spotted</text>
  <text start="1086.96" dur="4.71">and the Syrian government came down hard</text>
  <text start="1089.27" dur="3.99">on them and they killed several of the</text>
  <text start="1091.67" dur="3.81">fighters and the fighters never made it</text>
  <text start="1093.26" dur="4.56">to where they I guess their mission had</text>
  <text start="1095.48" dur="4.49">them going and again we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="1097.82" dur="5.25">because we understand what is happening</text>
  <text start="1099.97" dur="4.99">we understand they are losing the</text>
  <text start="1103.07" dur="5.849">central bankers US government are losing</text>
  <text start="1104.96" dur="7.29">the war in Syria I mean Assad has been</text>
  <text start="1108.919" dur="6">pushing the rebels back he almost has</text>
  <text start="1112.25" dur="5.58">the entire country at this point most of</text>
  <text start="1114.919" dur="5.971">the chemical weapons are out of Syria so</text>
  <text start="1117.83" dur="5.82">the US government really has nothing to</text>
  <text start="1120.89" dur="4.26">say about this the Geneva 2 talks failed</text>
  <text start="1123.65" dur="3.54">because they only had one thing on the</text>
  <text start="1125.15" dur="4.649">agenda which was to remove Assad and</text>
  <text start="1127.19" dur="4.739">ever since then they&amp;#39;ve been building up</text>
  <text start="1129.799" dur="4.411">the propaganda about cyber attacks from</text>
  <text start="1131.929" dur="5.361">the SE a they&amp;#39;ve been talking about the</text>
  <text start="1134.21" dur="5.31">hidden biological chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="1137.29" dur="5.05">we understand why all this is happening</text>
  <text start="1139.52" dur="5.64">we understand where this is going to</text>
  <text start="1142.34" dur="5.31">lead us because again we saw this happen</text>
  <text start="1145.16" dur="4.019">back in August and they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="1147.65" dur="5.43">give up because their goal is the same</text>
  <text start="1149.179" dur="6.091">they need Iran on the central banking</text>
  <text start="1153.08" dur="4.2">system they need Syria on the central</text>
  <text start="1155.27" dur="4.44">banking system they need those leaders</text>
  <text start="1157.28" dur="4.47">out of the country they need while they</text>
  <text start="1159.71" dur="3.45">needed Ukraine but they&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="1161.75" dur="3.299">Ukraine they&amp;#39;re only getting a small</text>
  <text start="1163.16" dur="4.23">portion of it and there&amp;#39;s more towns and</text>
  <text start="1165.049" dur="4.351">cities that want to join Russia at this</text>
  <text start="1167.39" dur="4.35">point so the central bankers at this</text>
  <text start="1169.4" dur="4.649">time are really losing the battle and</text>
  <text start="1171.74" dur="5.04">when they become desperate enough you</text>
