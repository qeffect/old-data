  <text start="123.29" dur="5.34">catching on what is really going on here</text>
  <text start="125.63" dur="6.09">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that the</text>
  <text start="128.63" dur="6.69">economy here in the US around the world</text>
  <text start="131.72" dur="5.549">and all the predictions that the central</text>
  <text start="135.32" dur="4.83">bank the government&amp;#39;s have made they</text>
  <text start="137.269" dur="5.31">haven&amp;#39;t come true I mean they tell us</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="4.77">GDP is going to be moving up to three to</text>
  <text start="142.579" dur="3.75">four percent and they keep telling us</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="4.409">it&amp;#39;s going to happen next year next year</text>
  <text start="146.329" dur="4.951">next year and actually if you look at</text>
  <text start="149.329" dur="3.781">what they&amp;#39;re saying the opposite occurs</text>
  <text start="151.28" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;re telling us that unemployment is</text>
  <text start="153.11" dur="3.87">going to drop and we&amp;#39;re going to be in</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="3.75">full employment but yeah if they</text>
  <text start="156.98" dur="5.009">manipulate the numbers they could hit</text>
  <text start="158.78" dur="5.82">the statistical number but the reality</text>
  <text start="161.989" dur="4.411">of the number of people</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="3.54">not in the workforce they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="4.38">anything with ya they can try to explain</text>
  <text start="168.14" dur="5.1">it away but when we look around we see</text>
  <text start="170.78" dur="4.98">that the country&amp;#39;s just keep on taking</text>
  <text start="173.24" dur="5.94">on more and more debt I mean look at</text>
  <text start="175.76" dur="5.79">Spain for instance the Bank of Spain</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="4.8">their figures show that the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="181.55" dur="5.64">public debt is now worth more than the</text>
  <text start="183.98" dur="5.88">value of the economy the public debt</text>
  <text start="187.19" dur="6.68">stockpile stood at 1.09 trillion euros</text>
  <text start="189.86" dur="6.87">in the first quarter of this year and</text>
  <text start="193.87" dur="7.54">that represents 101 percent of the</text>
  <text start="196.73" dur="7.25">country&amp;#39;s annual gdp now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="201.41" dur="6.56">saying is don&amp;#39;t worry about this because</text>
  <text start="203.98" dur="7.81">next year we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="207.97" dur="6.67">reverse itself instead of being a</text>
  <text start="211.79" dur="3.99">hundred and 101 percent of GDP they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.64" dur="4.77">telling us it&amp;#39;s going to go down to</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="6.33">ninety-five percent of GDP out of thin</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="4.95">air of course now of course we know this</text>
  <text start="222.11" dur="4.83">is fake phony and false we know this is</text>
  <text start="224.36" dur="4.92">a rumor this is to make everyone feel</text>
  <text start="226.94" dur="4.05">like oh yes okay we&amp;#39;re at this point but</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t worry about it but we have to look</text>
  <text start="230.99" dur="5.67">back in time and we continually see the</text>
  <text start="234.11" dur="4.14">same patterns of what the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.66" dur="3.3">and what the government&amp;#39;s tell us that</text>
  <text start="238.25" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t worry next year things are going</text>
  <text start="239.96" dur="5.06">to improve well have we seen an</text>
  <text start="242.3" dur="7.71">improvement or have we seen a</text>
  <text start="245.02" dur="8.92">manipulation of data or have we seen the</text>
  <text start="250.01" dur="6.93">opposite occur have the job market</text>
  <text start="253.94" dur="6">improved no actually we&amp;#39;re seeing more</text>
  <text start="256.94" dur="5.79">and more layoffs around the world has</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="7.38">GDP improved actually no it&amp;#39;s going the</text>
  <text start="262.73" dur="6.65">opposite way have we seen the debt level</text>
  <text start="267.32" dur="7.46">in each one of these countries go down</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="8.23">no actually in Greece they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="274.78" dur="4.3">stop grease from paying interest or</text>
  <text start="277.61" dur="3.93">maybe some of the principal because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.08" dur="4.61">gotten so bad actually there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="281.54" dur="3.93">improvement in Greece whatsoever</text>
  <text start="283.69" dur="6.01">actually in France there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="285.47" dur="7.23">improvement in Spain Italy all the banks</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="6.56">in Europe they&amp;#39;re in trouble the banks</text>
  <text start="292.7" dur="3.56">in the united states are in trouble</text>
  <text start="296.48" dur="5.34">what we are seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="299.24" dur="5.4">central banks and the government hanging</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="4.26">on to their lies anyway they possibly</text>
  <text start="304.64" dur="5.46">can to convince the world that</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="8.25">everything is fine but when you scrape</text>
  <text start="310.1" dur="7.08">away all these lies you get to the truth</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="5.7">and the truth of the matter is that the</text>
  <text start="317.18" dur="6.93">economies of the world they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="320.03" dur="7.02">what they say they are doing they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="6.99">improving everything&amp;#39;s going in the</text>
  <text start="327.05" dur="7.59">opposite direction in retail we see</text>
  <text start="331.1" dur="5.69">retail contracting dramatically and more</text>
  <text start="334.64" dur="5.58">more stores come out with their earnings</text>
  <text start="336.79" dur="7.56">target came out and they&amp;#39;re slashing</text>
  <text start="340.22" dur="8.09">guidance right now their sales are</text>
  <text start="344.35" dur="6.19">declining right now down two percent and</text>
  <text start="348.31" dur="4.36">we&amp;#39;re continually seeing more and more</text>
  <text start="350.54" dur="5.21">stores count and say okay our sales</text>
  <text start="352.67" dur="5.55">aren&amp;#39;t where they&amp;#39;re supposed to be and</text>
  <text start="355.75" dur="4.75">this is a huge problem because what</text>
  <text start="358.22" dur="5.45">happens then is they close towards they</text>
  <text start="360.5" dur="5.55">lay off people and retail contracts and</text>
  <text start="363.67" dur="4.03">of course they&amp;#39;re blaming the consumer</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="3.81">the complaining they&amp;#39;re blaming the</text>
  <text start="367.7" dur="4.11">American people you know you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="369.86" dur="4.47">spending well we would spend if we had</text>
  <text start="371.81" dur="4.44">jobs high paying jobs if the economy</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="3.83">wasn&amp;#39;t created as a bubble of all the</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="9.8">wealth wasn&amp;#39;t going up to the elite if</text>
  <text start="378.16" dur="11.77">we had a true real economy a free market</text>
  <text start="386.05" dur="6.79">yeah the people would spend but when</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="4.65">people hear rumors of layoffs they see</text>
  <text start="392.84" dur="3.36">people being laid off in their companies</text>
  <text start="394.58" dur="5.28">guess what they&amp;#39;re going to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="396.2" dur="4.98">going to do the opposite now Obama he</text>
  <text start="399.86" dur="5.34">just went out and signed an executive</text>
  <text start="401.18" dur="6.66">order and it looks like he is pushing</text>
  <text start="405.2" dur="6.3">overtime pay now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="407.84" dur="6.84">about this is that he doubled the</text>
  <text start="411.5" dur="6.6">threshold for overtime pay to 47,000 476</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="6.21">a year and this is going to affect about</text>
  <text start="418.1" dur="4.47">4.2 million workers now one of the</text>
  <text start="420.89" dur="4.14">things he was saying of why he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="422.57" dur="4.62">this is because of inflation comfort</text>
  <text start="425.03" dur="4.23">very interesting is the Fed and the</text>
  <text start="427.19" dur="3.24">government keeps telling us that there</text>
  <text start="429.26" dur="4.02">is no inflation</text>
  <text start="430.43" dur="6.33">so which is it is their inflation or</text>
  <text start="433.28" dur="6.96">isn&amp;#39;t there of course there is I mean</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="5.37">just go back in time I mean if you go</text>
  <text start="440.24" dur="4.32">back to nineteen eighty you go back to</text>
  <text start="442.13" dur="6.47">nineteen seventy 1990 you can see</text>
  <text start="444.56" dur="6.27">inflation in food you can see how prices</text>
  <text start="448.6" dur="4.9">increase dramatically actually the value</text>
  <text start="450.83" dur="7.8">of the dollar decrease but we see it in</text>
  <text start="453.5" dur="10.11">the prices of products but this might</text>
  <text start="458.63" dur="11.31">cause a problem think about this right</text>
  <text start="463.61" dur="9.45">now he doubled the overtime pay the</text>
  <text start="469.94" dur="7.97">threshold from 23,000 to forty-seven</text>
  <text start="473.06" dur="8.85">thousand dollars now these are salaried</text>
  <text start="477.91" dur="6.87">workers now what companies usually do</text>
  <text start="481.91" dur="6.21">they look at the situation they say hmm</text>
  <text start="484.78" dur="5.83">we can&amp;#39;t do this so they might take</text>
  <text start="488.12" dur="4.89">hundreds of thousands of workers they</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="6.08">might reclassify them as hourly</text>
  <text start="493.01" dur="6.96">employees instead of salaried workers</text>
  <text start="496.69" dur="5.56">many could then have their hours cut to</text>
  <text start="499.97" dur="4.65">what thirty eight hours a week in order</text>
  <text start="502.25" dur="5.58">for their employers to avoid paying them</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="6.9">any type of overtime so we might see</text>
  <text start="507.83" dur="9.06">less over time reduce benefits more</text>
  <text start="511.52" dur="9.63">incentives to dump employees now we saw</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="6.99">this with Obamacare didn&amp;#39;t we companies</text>
  <text start="521.15" dur="4.47">went ahead and said okay instead of 32</text>
  <text start="523.88" dur="5.46">hours we&amp;#39;re going to put you below that</text>
  <text start="525.62" dur="8.16">this way we don&amp;#39;t have to supply you</text>
  <text start="529.34" dur="6.9">with health insurance and they reduce</text>
  <text start="533.78" dur="4.58">the number of people in their business</text>
  <text start="536.24" dur="5.4">because if you&amp;#39;re under 50 employees</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="5.79">that&amp;#39;s where you wanted to be and every</text>
  <text start="541.64" dur="7.11">time the government tries to metal and</text>
  <text start="544.15" dur="6.51">try to tell businesses what to do they</text>
  <text start="548.75" dur="4.62">react in the opposite way look at the</text>
  <text start="550.66" dur="5.62">minimum wage they decided to bring it up</text>
  <text start="553.37" dur="5.57">to $15 now all those people who were</text>
  <text start="556.28" dur="5.7">working in like McDonald&amp;#39;s Wendy&amp;#39;s or</text>
  <text start="558.94" dur="5.339">places like that everyone had a job</text>
  <text start="561.98" dur="5.279">making whatever minimum wage they had</text>
  <text start="564.279" dur="4.54">then all of a sudden they moved the</text>
  <text start="567.259" dur="3.75">minimum wage up now of course companies</text>
  <text start="568.819" dur="3">look at this and they say well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="571.009" dur="2.22">gonna have to get rid of all these</text>
  <text start="571.819" dur="3.54">employees will replace them with</text>
  <text start="573.229" dur="3.36">touchscreens and we don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="575.359" dur="2.58">about benefits we don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="576.589" dur="3">about employees we&amp;#39;d have to worry about</text>
  <text start="577.939" dur="3.92">workers comp worry about any of that</text>
  <text start="579.589" dur="6.99">because now we have one person manning</text>
  <text start="581.859" dur="7.33">nine touch screen stations you&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="586.579" dur="4.59">it in stores today you go into a store</text>
  <text start="589.189" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s one person handling about eight</text>
  <text start="591.169" dur="6.12">registers because everyone&amp;#39;s checking</text>
  <text start="593.689" dur="10.32">out themselves and this is not a fix</text>
  <text start="597.289" dur="11.19">this is a bandaid on top of a huge</text>
  <text start="604.009" dur="7.61">problem we need to go back to the real</text>
  <text start="608.479" dur="6.27">problem and that&amp;#39;s the central bank</text>
  <text start="611.619" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re creating currency out of thin</text>
  <text start="614.749" dur="7.05">air and attaching interest to it</text>
  <text start="617.169" dur="6.13">devaluing the dollar and this is what</text>
  <text start="621.799" dur="5.94">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now the value of the</text>
  <text start="623.299" dur="6.78">dollar is continually decreasing so it</text>
  <text start="627.739" dur="9.35">takes more dollars to pay for certain</text>
  <text start="630.079" dur="10.23">things if we got rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="637.089" dur="7.391">we would be on our way in fixing our</text>
  <text start="640.309" dur="6.81">problems but just continually raising</text>
  <text start="644.48" dur="5.039">the minimum wage because this is done</text>
  <text start="647.119" dur="5.19">throughout time has it ever worked out</text>
  <text start="649.519" dur="6.27">to anyone&amp;#39;s benefit yes in the short run</text>
  <text start="652.309" dur="7.02">it does Oh people are saying I just got</text>
  <text start="655.789" dur="5.67">a raise from eight dollars to $15 two</text>
  <text start="659.329" dur="5.03">months later I just lost my job because</text>
  <text start="661.459" dur="6.33">now they replaced me with a touchscreen</text>
  <text start="664.359" dur="5.08">certain people it will benefit because</text>
  <text start="667.789" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;ll still be getting paid but the</text>
  <text start="669.439" dur="8.01">majority they lose out now we know the</text>
  <text start="674.929" dur="5.25">we know President Obama came out and</text>
  <text start="677.449" dur="5.03">told us that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="680.179" dur="9.24">back in his State of the Union address</text>
  <text start="682.479" dur="8.47">well the city surprised index is showing</text>
  <text start="689.419" dur="3.53">us something completely different from</text>
  <text start="690.949" dur="6.6">what the president has been telling us</text>
  <text start="692.949" dur="5.321">so this when the CSI is consistently</text>
  <text start="697.549" dur="3.261">posting</text>
  <text start="698.27" dur="5.04">large positive numbers it implies that</text>
  <text start="700.81" dur="4.63">economist models are under estimating</text>
  <text start="703.31" dur="4.08">growth when such a condition persists</text>
  <text start="705.44" dur="4.26">investors can have increased confidence</text>
  <text start="707.39" dur="4.77">that forthcoming economic data may be</text>
  <text start="709.7" dur="5.61">better than expected the opposite is</text>

  <text start="735.89" dur="4.56">that the economists are not just</text>
  <text start="738.2" dur="4.04">slightly off the mark the consensus of</text>
  <text start="740.45" dur="4.83">professional forecasters are</text>
  <text start="742.24" dur="4.72">consistently badly missing the mark by</text>
  <text start="745.28" dur="4.29">overestimating the strength of the</text>

  <text start="749.57" dur="5.46">economy is not strong at all now if we</text>
  <text start="753.23" dur="3.21">go back in time and we look at all the</text>
  <text start="755.03" dur="4.86">different economic indicators that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="756.44" dur="6.6">been looking at we can see from retail</text>
  <text start="759.89" dur="8.1">from manufacturing from gdp from</text>
  <text start="763.04" dur="8.19">unemployment from housing that the</text>
  <text start="767.99" dur="5.4">economy is not doing what the president</text>
  <text start="771.23" dur="3.96">is trying to convince us of it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="773.39" dur="4.53">actually doing the opposite and remember</text>
  <text start="775.19" dur="4.92">every time these government employees</text>
  <text start="777.92" dur="6.3">come out and tell us something it always</text>
  <text start="780.11" dur="6.18">seems to be the opposite and we are</text>
  <text start="784.22" dur="3.33">seeing that right now this is why the</text>
  <text start="786.29" dur="3.99">president had to come out and defend</text>
  <text start="787.55" dur="4.65">what the economy was doing this is why</text>
  <text start="790.28" dur="3.3">there was an emergency meeting with the</text>
  <text start="792.2" dur="3.33">Fed and the President and the Vice</text>
  <text start="793.58" dur="3.92">President both were in this meeting</text>
  <text start="795.53" dur="6.09">which is highly unusual unless something</text>
  <text start="797.5" dur="7.09">big was happening and I needed to meet</text>
  <text start="801.62" dur="4.62">on what was going on here and when we</text>
  <text start="804.59" dur="3.63">look at this we can say okay emergency</text>
  <text start="806.24" dur="4.52">meeting both showing up at the same</text>
  <text start="808.22" dur="6.33">exact time something big is happening</text>
  <text start="810.76" dur="9.34">here in the US and around the world now</text>
  <text start="814.55" dur="9.24">Texas they are deciding to build their</text>
  <text start="820.1" dur="6.18">own gold depository which will allow</text>
  <text start="823.79" dur="5.1">individuals to store their gold in a</text>
  <text start="826.28" dur="5.4">safe place outside the United States</text>
  <text start="828.89" dur="7.11">banking system</text>
  <text start="831.68" dur="7.849">now of course Wall Street the Fed they</text>
  <text start="836" dur="7.11">were saying this is not a good idea and</text>
  <text start="839.529" dur="7.361">they were saying that they should not do</text>
  <text start="843.11" dur="6.18">this because the rest of the world will</text>
  <text start="846.89" dur="3.449">lose faith in the u.s. central</text>
  <text start="849.29" dur="2.85">government and the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="850.339" dur="5.87">System well I think they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="852.14" dur="7.199">losing faith well in spite of this</text>
  <text start="856.209" dur="6.281">disapproval by Wall Street the US</text>
  <text start="859.339" dur="5.521">government Federal Reserve Texas they</text>
  <text start="862.49" dur="8.849">decided to pass the bill and they signed</text>
  <text start="864.86" dur="8.43">it into law last June now the bill only</text>
  <text start="871.339" dur="4.531">passed when it was modified to create</text>
  <text start="873.29" dur="6">what is seemingly a state-chartered gold</text>
  <text start="875.87" dur="6.18">depository that will privately that will</text>
  <text start="879.29" dur="5.97">be privately owned and paid for via fees</text>
  <text start="882.05" dur="5.039">for gold storage so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="885.26" dur="5.07">planning to do with this is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="887.089" dur="11.25">going to use this and issue currency off</text>
  <text start="890.33" dur="10.14">of the gold that is there so users will</text>
  <text start="898.339" dur="4.201">be able to use this currency which is</text>
  <text start="900.47" dur="8.28">backed by gold think about this for a</text>
  <text start="902.54" dur="8.669">second so wherever they go gold will</text>
  <text start="908.75" dur="4.44">move from this depository to another</text>
  <text start="911.209" dur="5.221">person&amp;#39;s account when they decide to</text>
  <text start="913.19" dur="8.88">purchase something not electronic</text>
  <text start="916.43" dur="8.04">dollars not paper dollars and what they</text>
  <text start="922.07" dur="3.93">can do here is they can have the gold</text>
  <text start="924.47" dur="3.6">either directly deposit into another&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="926" dur="4.529">account or they can have it converted to</text>
  <text start="928.07" dur="5.7">US dollars and deposit in a conventional</text>
  <text start="930.529" dur="5.371">Bank so really what we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="933.77" dur="10.83">right now is an electronic version of</text>
  <text start="935.9" dur="11.97">gold back money now we are seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="944.6" dur="7.049">of countries right now sell off u.s.</text>
  <text start="947.87" dur="5.07">debt and most likely Saudi Arabia would</text>
  <text start="951.649" dur="2.93">like to sell some of the step because</text>
  <text start="952.94" dur="4.37">Saudi Arabia is in trouble right now</text>
  <text start="954.579" dur="8.2">their debt level is increasing</text>
  <text start="957.31" dur="7.57">dramatically and this whole plan of</text>
  <text start="962.779" dur="3.951">suppressing oil is</text>
  <text start="964.88" dur="5.33">wreaking havoc on the Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="966.73" dur="7.03">economy because they have to pay</text>
  <text start="970.21" dur="5.08">contractors in iou&amp;#39;s at this time so</text>
  <text start="973.76" dur="3.3">what we are seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="975.29" dur="4.53">Russia China Brazil and many other</text>
  <text start="977.06" dur="5.82">countries they are selling off their US</text>
  <text start="979.82" dur="4.98">Treasuries very slowly and they each</text>
  <text start="982.88" dur="5.49">sold off at least 1 billion in u.s.</text>
  <text start="984.8" dur="7.67">treasury bonds in March and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="988.37" dur="7.29">that central banks sold a net 17 billion</text>
  <text start="992.47" dur="6.73">sales had hit a record 57 billion in</text>
  <text start="995.66" dur="5.76">January it is the fastest pace for us</text>
  <text start="999.2" dur="4.86">dead sell off by global central bank</text>
  <text start="1001.42" dur="5.7">since at least 1978 and this is coming</text>
  <text start="1004.06" dur="4.89">from the Treasury Department data now</text>
  <text start="1007.12" dur="3.75">what the countries and the central banks</text>
  <text start="1008.95" dur="5.91">are saying at this point is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1010.87" dur="8.28">still this fear of everything falling</text>
  <text start="1014.86" dur="6.27">apart and most likely these countries</text>
  <text start="1019.15" dur="4.38">are selling the Treasuries to prop up</text>
  <text start="1021.13" dur="4.23">their currencies by selling u.s. debt</text>
  <text start="1023.53" dur="4.289">central banks can get hard cash to buy</text>
  <text start="1025.36" dur="6.54">up their local currency and prevent it</text>
  <text start="1027.819" dur="6.541">from losing too much value so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1031.9" dur="4.38">seeing that country&amp;#39;s central banks</text>
  <text start="1034.36" dur="5.18">around the world they&amp;#39;re getting more</text>
  <text start="1036.28" dur="6.69">and more nervous as time goes on they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1039.54" dur="4.99">removing the debt level that they have</text>
  <text start="1042.97" dur="2.729">that they&amp;#39;re keeping from the US and</text>
  <text start="1044.53" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re getting rid of it at this point</text>
  <text start="1045.699" dur="5.011">and this is continually happening now of</text>
  <text start="1048.67" dur="4.86">course if there&amp;#39;s if there&amp;#39;s a seller</text>
  <text start="1050.71" dur="7.44">there has to be a buyer and of course as</text>
  <text start="1053.53" dur="8.25">we know the Fed has Japan as Belgium has</text>
  <text start="1058.15" dur="6.51">other individuals purchased Treasuries</text>
  <text start="1061.78" dur="6.06">to keep up with the countries that are</text>
  <text start="1064.66" dur="7.95">selling now the Fed had their meeting</text>
  <text start="1067.84" dur="5.94">today and they put out rumors they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1072.61" dur="4.35">trying to convince everyone that going</text>
  <text start="1073.78" dur="4.5">to be having a rate hike in June and it</text>
  <text start="1076.96" dur="3.5">looked like they were trying to push the</text>
  <text start="1078.28" dur="4.35">market up but it didn&amp;#39;t work at all and</text>
  <text start="1080.46" dur="4.15">they&amp;#39;re saying that you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1082.63" dur="5.13">going to have to look at the data to see</text>
  <text start="1084.61" dur="6.27">if the data does support a June hike now</text>
  <text start="1087.76" dur="5.61">it does look like they&amp;#39;re just trying to</text>
  <text start="1090.88" dur="5.07">keep this economy alive at this point</text>
  <text start="1093.37" dur="5.11">using these rumors trying to push up the</text>
  <text start="1095.95" dur="5.77">market and we see it</text>
  <text start="1098.48" dur="6.329">point that it is not working the</text>
  <text start="1101.72" dur="7.35">country&amp;#39;s the people they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="1104.809" dur="7.261">faith in the central bank the economies</text>
  <text start="1109.07" dur="6.42">are crashing faster than they can spin</text>
  <text start="1112.07" dur="5.79">their propaganda and they&amp;#39;re running out</text>
