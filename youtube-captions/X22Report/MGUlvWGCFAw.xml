  <text start="141.63" dur="8.3">complete mistake they&amp;#39;re saying it hurt</text>
  <text start="146.07" dur="8.249">Greece and did not help it whatsoever</text>
  <text start="149.93" dur="6.69">yeah because what happened was they</text>
  <text start="154.319" dur="6.211">joined up to a central bank system an</text>
  <text start="156.62" dur="5.83">essential Bank system like the Fed they</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="4.5">have a product it&amp;#39;s called debt</text>
  <text start="162.45" dur="4.41">their product is debt and they put each</text>
  <text start="165.03" dur="4.11">and every one of these countries into</text>
  <text start="166.86" dur="4.44">debt they don&amp;#39;t care about the people</text>
  <text start="169.14" dur="4.29">they don&amp;#39;t care about the government all</text>
  <text start="171.3" dur="7.38">they care about is placing that country</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="7.71">into so much debt that they are helpless</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="4.29">to do anything else then they swoop in</text>
  <text start="181.14" dur="3.45">they privatize everything and they</text>
  <text start="182.97" dur="4.5">sell-off bits and pieces of the country</text>
  <text start="184.59" dur="6.869">this is how the central bankers make</text>
  <text start="187.47" dur="6.329">their fortunes they steal the natural</text>
  <text start="191.459" dur="5.701">resources of the country they give them</text>
  <text start="193.799" dur="4.401">this ridiculous paper and ink they call</text>
  <text start="197.16" dur="4.5">it money</text>
  <text start="198.2" dur="5.83">the government&amp;#39;s believe them they put</text>
  <text start="201.66" dur="4.71">them into debt and they swoop in and</text>
  <text start="204.03" dur="4.41">take the real assets of the country</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="4.949">remember central banks have no</text>
  <text start="208.44" dur="5.73">allegiance to a country or people their</text>
  <text start="211.319" dur="6">allegiance is to themselves it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="214.17" dur="5.879">profit it&amp;#39;s to their product which is</text>
  <text start="217.319" dur="6.42">called debt this is why they keep saying</text>
  <text start="220.049" dur="7.621">we need more of this we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="5.491">enough of it I mean does it make any</text>
  <text start="227.67" dur="4.83">sense think about your own household</text>
  <text start="229.23" dur="6.509">right now bringing on more debt does</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="5.79">that help you or does it make the</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="5.4">situation worse I know it does in my</text>
  <text start="238.29" dur="6.89">house when there&amp;#39;s too much debt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.139" dur="6.57">awful when there&amp;#39;s a little bit of debt</text>
  <text start="245.18" dur="6.429">it&amp;#39;s much better when there&amp;#39;s no debt</text>
  <text start="247.709" dur="8.12">it&amp;#39;s fantastic we see out in the</text>
  <text start="251.609" dur="8.91">eurozone the nine the 19 nation eurozone</text>
  <text start="255.829" dur="7.121">their GDP was revised and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.519" dur="5.611">letting everyone know that everything is</text>
  <text start="262.95" dur="5.43">okay there is nothing to worry about</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="5.13">because we just revised the numbers and</text>
  <text start="268.38" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re telling you that we&amp;#39;re doing a lot</text>
  <text start="271.26" dur="6.18">better we&amp;#39;re heading towards this</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="8.49">recovery really well when you really</text>
  <text start="277.44" dur="8.84">look at it is it that much better</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="7.86">no they upped it by like 0.1% point and</text>
  <text start="286.28" dur="6.58">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="7.62">everything is fine but coming from Fitch</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="5.34">what are we here eurozone countries</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="4.53">may not see their credit ratings</text>
  <text start="298.2" dur="9.66">returned to levels seen before the</text>
  <text start="300.84" dur="10.02">crisis of 2008-2009 it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="7.01">happen they&amp;#39;re telling us we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="310.86" dur="8.76">recovery but unemployment ranges from</text>
  <text start="314.87" dur="6.549">15% all the way up to 50% youth</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="8.58">unemployment ranges in these countries</text>
  <text start="321.419" dur="9.901">from 35% all the way up to 55% where is</text>
  <text start="328.2" dur="6.26">the recovery and then pile on the debt</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="5.76">on top of that so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="334.46" dur="6.88">this is not a recovery they pulled this</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="6.21">in the summer of 2013 where the eurozone</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="2.579">came out and said we&amp;#39;re in a full</text>
  <text start="343.29" dur="3.42">recovery</text>
  <text start="343.919" dur="6.391">unemployment&amp;#39;s gonna drop jobs are gonna</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="5.67">be created GDP is gonna go way up we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.31" dur="4.89">projecting gee at least four or five</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="5.28">percent GDP numbers guess what it</text>
  <text start="355.2" dur="7.23">doesn&amp;#39;t happen the only way it happens</text>
  <text start="357.66" dur="7.29">is when they manipulate the numbers we</text>
  <text start="362.43" dur="6.84">see the Chinese stock trading volume</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="6.54">collapsed to three year lows it looks</text>
  <text start="369.27" dur="5.94">like they have taken over their markets</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="5.28">the sellers are out and the volume has</text>
  <text start="375.21" dur="5.19">completely dropped actually we see this</text>
  <text start="376.77" dur="5.76">in the United States we see there is a</text>
  <text start="380.4" dur="4.26">very little bit of volume because what</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="2.94">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is high-frequency</text>
  <text start="384.66" dur="3.21">trading</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re seeing the plunge Protection Team</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="4.049">come in so the volume is very low but</text>
  <text start="390.27" dur="3.57">the stock market has continually pushed</text>
  <text start="391.919" dur="4.551">up and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of this</text>
  <text start="393.84" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;re gonna see the market fluctuate</text>
  <text start="396.47" dur="7.87">fluctuate back up we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="399.39" dur="9.96">2008 2001 1929 right before the collapse</text>
  <text start="404.34" dur="8.49">and this time it&amp;#39;s going to be much much</text>
  <text start="409.35" dur="6.87">worse and from all the government</text>
  <text start="412.83" dur="4.98">numbers in their statistical manipulated</text>
  <text start="416.22" dur="3.72">illusionary numbers that they keep</text>
  <text start="417.81" dur="5.79">throwing at us that unemployment is 5.1</text>
  <text start="419.94" dur="7.92">percent GDP is fantastic all the way up</text>
  <text start="423.6" dur="5.71">to three something percent what are we</text>
  <text start="427.86" dur="4.57">seeing here</text>
  <text start="429.31" dur="5.82">well if unemployment is continually</text>
  <text start="432.43" dur="7.17">dropping that means more people have</text>
  <text start="435.13" dur="6.39">work that means people are making money</text>
  <text start="439.6" dur="5.13">that means people are going to start</text>
  <text start="441.52" dur="5.49">spending their money I mean the gasoline</text>
  <text start="444.73" dur="5.37">prices are dropping like crazy people</text>
  <text start="447.01" dur="5.28">have extra money right you expect they</text>
  <text start="450.1" dur="4.32">would take all of this money and spend</text>
  <text start="452.29" dur="4.98">it in retail and go out and start</text>
  <text start="454.42" dur="6.72">purchasing things but why isn&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="457.27" dur="11.43">happening well when we look closely at</text>
  <text start="461.14" dur="11.22">this we see that spending is actually</text>
  <text start="468.7" dur="5.64">falling now we have to remember we have</text>
  <text start="472.36" dur="3.42">the Gallup poll and then we have a</text>
  <text start="474.34" dur="3.42">conference board the conference board is</text>
  <text start="475.78" dur="3.24">sponsored by the government the</text>
  <text start="477.76" dur="3.78">conference board is telling us that</text>
  <text start="479.02" dur="5.55">everything is absolutely fine the</text>
  <text start="481.54" dur="5.28">economic outlook looks fantastic the</text>
  <text start="484.57" dur="6.47">Gallup poll which is a people poll is</text>
  <text start="486.82" dur="7.68">showing that the economic outlook is</text>
  <text start="491.04" dur="6.12">worsening now according to the latest</text>
  <text start="494.5" dur="4.92">Gallup report unused consumer spending</text>
  <text start="497.16" dur="4.75">they took a random sample of about</text>
  <text start="499.42" dur="5.64">15,000 adults they&amp;#39;re interviewed by</text>
  <text start="501.91" dur="6.26">phone an Americans self-reported daily</text>
  <text start="505.06" dur="6.87">spending average about 89 dollars in</text>
  <text start="508.17" dur="6.34">August down not only from August of 2014</text>
  <text start="511.93" dur="4.77">and 2013 but the fourth month in a row</text>
  <text start="514.51" dur="5.64">of a year over year spending declines as</text>
  <text start="516.7" dur="8.78">well as the lowest monthly spend</text>
  <text start="520.15" dur="9.06">spending since March of 2015 as Gallup</text>
  <text start="525.48" dur="7.75">reminds us spending peaked at 114</text>
  <text start="529.21" dur="8.33">dollars in May of 2008 before completely</text>
  <text start="533.23" dur="8.88">plunging amid the global economic crisis</text>
  <text start="537.54" dur="7.54">from 2009 to 2012 spending stagnated</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="9.84">from 58 to 83 dollars</text>
  <text start="545.08" dur="11.61">and August right now is weak and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="7.4">falling now you would expect this to be</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="4.89">much much higher with everyone employed</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="6.52">because we&amp;#39;re almost</text>
  <text start="561.58" dur="7.25">at the point of full recovery but we are</text>
  <text start="565.87" dur="5.91">not seeing this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="568.83" dur="5.32">what we have right now are people</text>
  <text start="571.78" dur="4.61">working in part-time jobs we have to</text>
  <text start="574.15" dur="4.77">remember how this is all figured out</text>
  <text start="576.39" dur="6.22">when someone loses their full-time job</text>
  <text start="578.92" dur="4.53">and they get a part-time job or two</text>
  <text start="582.61" dur="2.67">part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s counted as a full-time job if</text>
  <text start="585.28" dur="3.48">they have two of them that&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="586.84" dur="5.03">full-time jobs even though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="588.76" dur="5.52">part-time this is why we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="591.87" dur="4.15">spending increasing this is why we see</text>
  <text start="594.28" dur="2.37">it falling because it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="596.02" dur="4.59">and worse</text>
  <text start="596.65" dur="7.14">as time goes on now during the crisis of</text>
  <text start="600.61" dur="5.16">2008 everyone decided okay I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="603.79" dur="3.33">save my money because I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="605.77" dur="4.17">what&amp;#39;s going to happen that&amp;#39;s why we saw</text>
  <text start="607.12" dur="8.01">those figures so low as time went on</text>
  <text start="609.94" dur="8.7">going to 2012 we never reached the same</text>
  <text start="615.13" dur="6.15">amount before it leveled off and now</text>
  <text start="618.64" dur="6.93">it&amp;#39;s falling again and from the start of</text>
  <text start="621.28" dur="9.36">this year we have seen massive layoffs</text>
  <text start="625.57" dur="9.63">we&amp;#39;re on track for 600,000 layoffs this</text>
  <text start="630.64" dur="8.28">year in the Great Recession when the</text>
  <text start="635.2" dur="6.96">market completely came down 1.2 million</text>
  <text start="638.92" dur="7.16">layoffs were in that year so if this is</text>
  <text start="642.16" dur="10.71">a recovery were in for a really big</text>
  <text start="646.08" dur="9.64">problem here now the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="652.87" dur="4.89">US government is trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="655.72" dur="5.37">that oh this little dip in the stock</text>

  <text start="683.77" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this whole</text>
  <text start="687.16" dur="5.16">entire system start to fall apart I mean</text>

  <text start="739.51" dur="6.45">all these bubbles are getting ready to</text>
  <text start="741.34" dur="9.75">pop because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="745.96" dur="7.41">economy is contracting I mean look at</text>
  <text start="751.09" dur="8.43">the ball to Dry Index it is falling out</text>

  <text start="802.36" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re getting io u--&amp;#39;s because the</text>
  <text start="805.09" dur="6.3">state doesn&amp;#39;t have the funds to pay</text>
  <text start="807.25" dur="5.64">these people Chicago Public Schools with</text>

  <text start="843.73" dur="9.57">Detroit is in big trouble Puerto Rico is</text>
  <text start="846.48" dur="10.06">defaulting so what are we seeing here we</text>
  <text start="853.3" dur="5.58">see a complete collapse of the system</text>
  <text start="856.54" dur="4.86">and all the central bank US government</text>
  <text start="858.88" dur="7.7">can do is manipulate numbers to convince</text>
  <text start="861.4" dur="12.12">you otherwise that is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="866.58" dur="8.83">we see Germany&amp;#39;s Wolfgang Shila he</text>
  <text start="873.52" dur="3.93">delivered a sharp critique of the</text>
  <text start="875.41" dur="7.14">world&amp;#39;s addiction to debt and central</text>
  <text start="877.45" dur="6.63">bank printing money he says an excessive</text>
  <text start="882.55" dur="5.06">reliance on debt and central bank</text>
  <text start="884.08" dur="6.93">stimulus is no way to manage an economy</text>
  <text start="887.61" dur="5.56">fewer debts fewer crises more</text>
  <text start="891.01" dur="5.84">sustainable growth that is the best</text>
  <text start="893.17" dur="5.73">policy we can produce I agree with him I</text>
  <text start="896.85" dur="5.53">don&amp;#39;t agree with him on a lot of things</text>
  <text start="898.9" dur="7.77">but I do agree agree with him on this we</text>
  <text start="902.38" dur="7.95">see IMF Christine Lagarde in her speech</text>
  <text start="906.67" dur="7.92">in the g20 meetings in Ankara she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="910.33" dur="7.14">telling us that in capitalism bubbles</text>
  <text start="914.59" dur="4.71">will eventually burst the only problem</text>
  <text start="917.47" dur="6.2">is we don&amp;#39;t have capitalism we have</text>
  <text start="919.3" dur="8.55">fascism we have a controlled economy</text>
  <text start="923.67" dur="7.15">which is being artificially blown up to</text>
  <text start="927.85" dur="7.83">burst so what she&amp;#39;s saying is absolutely</text>
  <text start="930.82" dur="7.65">false we have figured out who the</text>
  <text start="935.68" dur="5.31">mystery buyer of all these US Treasuries</text>
  <text start="938.47" dur="6.72">are you know the Treasuries that China</text>
  <text start="940.99" dur="6.81">is dumping through Belgium all of a</text>
  <text start="945.19" dur="6.09">sudden now from The Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="947.8" dur="6.05">it is a hedge fund run by former Yale</text>
  <text start="951.28" dur="2.57">University</text>
  <text start="954" dur="6.61">Jeffrey talyn&amp;#39;s of element Capital</text>
  <text start="957.55" dur="5.519">Management he worked for Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="960.61" dur="4.469">the largest purchaser in dozens of</text>
  <text start="963.069" dur="6">government bond auctions over the past</text>
  <text start="965.079" dur="10.26">ten months this is who is buying up the</text>
  <text start="969.069" dur="8.25">bonds so we can see at this point and we</text>
  <text start="975.339" dur="4.021">if we do notice that most of these</text>
  <text start="977.319" dur="4.56">people work for Goldman all part of the</text>
  <text start="979.36" dur="4.74">central bank system all there to keep</text>
  <text start="981.879" dur="4.291">the system alive to make sure that there</text>
  <text start="984.1" dur="4.38">is a buyer for the Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="986.17" dur="5.099">because if there is a seller there must</text>
  <text start="988.48" dur="6.109">be a buyer and the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="991.269" dur="10.021">take on more of this to add to their</text>
  <text start="994.589" dur="11.79">portfolio so we see it right now the Fed</text>
  <text start="1001.29" dur="7.949">is having Japan hedge funds banks all</text>
  <text start="1006.379" dur="7">purchase the Treasury bonds to take up</text>
  <text start="1009.239" dur="7.111">the slack now we know China they are</text>
  <text start="1013.379" dur="6.3">purchasing a lot of gold they&amp;#39;re selling</text>
  <text start="1016.35" dur="6.51">their Treasuries and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="1019.679" dur="6.24">selling their Treasuries and the month</text>
  <text start="1022.86" dur="6.179">of August China added fifteen point nine</text>
  <text start="1025.919" dur="5.701">eight tons of gold to their gold</text>
  <text start="1029.039" dur="8.461">holdings and like I said the country</text>
  <text start="1031.62" dur="9.39">that holds the gold is going to come out</text>
  <text start="1037.5" dur="7.049">as the winner those people who have gold</text>
  <text start="1041.01" dur="6.87">or silver they&amp;#39;re gonna come out okay</text>
  <text start="1044.549" dur="9.23">through the crisis if we&amp;#39;re just looking</text>
  <text start="1047.88" dur="9">at it economically China right now is</text>
  <text start="1053.779" dur="4.091">planning to launch its own oil benchmark</text>
  <text start="1056.88" dur="4.98">in October</text>
  <text start="1057.87" dur="5.279">similar to Brent and WTI striving for a</text>
  <text start="1061.86" dur="3.449">more important role in establishing</text>
  <text start="1063.149" dur="4.351">crude prices unlike the Western</text>
  <text start="1065.309" dur="6.901">benchmarks that Chinese contracts will</text>
  <text start="1067.5" dur="8.37">be nominated in the you wan not the US</text>
  <text start="1072.21" dur="5.13">dollar oil futures will be the first</text>
  <text start="1075.87" dur="3.38">Chinese contract to permit direct</text>
  <text start="1077.34" dur="3.959">participation of foreign investors</text>
  <text start="1079.25" dur="4.09">however this is not the first step for</text>
  <text start="1081.299" dur="4.62">greater oil market openness in China in</text>
  <text start="1083.34" dur="5.52">july beijing allowed private companies</text>
  <text start="1085.919" dur="6.24">to import crude previously importing was</text>
  <text start="1088.86" dur="5.46">only done by state-run majors such as</text>
  <text start="1092.159" dur="5.311">Sinopec</text>
  <text start="1094.32" dur="7.08">so what do we see here we see China now</text>
  <text start="1097.47" dur="8.34">is making an additional move they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1101.4" dur="7.74">purchasing gold they are selling their</text>
  <text start="1105.81" dur="5.94">Treasuries and now they&amp;#39;re creating the</text>
  <text start="1109.14" dur="4.71">petrol you want they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="1111.75" dur="4.16">using the dollar they&amp;#39;ve been making</text>
  <text start="1113.85" dur="4.35">bilateral trades all across the world</text>
  <text start="1115.91" dur="5.02">trading in you on setting up clearing</text>
  <text start="1118.2" dur="5.73">houses which bypasses the dollar they</text>
  <text start="1120.93" dur="5.25">are delinking from the Western world at</text>
  <text start="1123.93" dur="5.25">this point and this is why we see a</text>
  <text start="1126.18" dur="4.71">ramped up with the corporate media with</text>
  <text start="1129.18" dur="5.28">the US government the central bankers in</text>
  <text start="1130.89" dur="6.11">blaming China for everything that is</text>
  <text start="1134.46" dur="4.95">happening I guess in a roundabout way</text>
  <text start="1137" dur="4.35">they are to blame because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1139.41" dur="6.03">completely D linking from the system and</text>
  <text start="1141.35" dur="6.24">this is causing havoc on the system so</text>
  <text start="1145.44" dur="5.64">if you want to look at it that way yes</text>
  <text start="1147.59" dur="5.35">they are the cause but the real cause</text>
  <text start="1151.08" dur="4.25">when we go to the meat and potatoes of</text>
  <text start="1152.94" dur="6">all this is the central bank system</text>
  <text start="1155.33" dur="6.4">remember all these countries have a huge</text>
  <text start="1158.94" dur="5.37">amount of debt unemployment GDP is down</text>
  <text start="1161.73" dur="5.85">the toilet there&amp;#39;s no more manufacturing</text>
  <text start="1164.31" dur="7.32">it&amp;#39;s falling apart and all they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1167.58" dur="5.64">is creating money and we know eventually</text>
