  <text start="113.38" dur="3.81">you know retail sales are bad because of</text>
  <text start="115.15" dur="4.859">weather because it was going to online</text>
  <text start="117.19" dur="4.349">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="120.009" dur="3.72">none of that is true</text>
  <text start="121.539" dur="4.771">it looks like the everyday person</text>
  <text start="123.729" dur="5.011">they&amp;#39;re tapped out people can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="126.31" dur="5.16">high-paying jobs wages are continually</text>
  <text start="128.74" dur="4.83">declining and we&amp;#39;re seeing out in the UK</text>

  <text start="133.57" dur="4.65">retailers saying that retail sales</text>
  <text start="136.21" dur="4.68">they are absolutely awful they fell by</text>
  <text start="138.22" dur="4.53">1.2 percent between February and March</text>
  <text start="140.89" dur="3.9">and they thought they were going to have</text>
  <text start="142.75" dur="4.26">a boost because they thought this was</text>
  <text start="144.79" dur="5.91">all because of bad weather and guess</text>
  <text start="147.01" dur="6.45">what it wasn&amp;#39;t about bad weather and we</text>
  <text start="150.7" dur="5.97">can see right now that all this is</text>
  <text start="153.46" dur="4.59">happening because the entire system is</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="3.71">starting to break down</text>
  <text start="158.05" dur="4.83">I mean look here in the United States</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="3.91">they kept on telling us that you know</text>
  <text start="162.88" dur="3.689">the retail stores are closing because</text>
  <text start="164.29" dur="4.62">everything is moving online and we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="168.91" dur="3.6">well they&amp;#39;re closing down now of course</text>
  <text start="171.1" dur="2.969">people are gonna say well they&amp;#39;re moving</text>

  <text start="198.51" dur="7.14">get their sandwiches from Amazon no</text>
  <text start="201.53" dur="7.42">what&amp;#39;s happening here is people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="5.309">afford to go out and purchase food this</text>
  <text start="208.95" dur="4.44">is why we see restaurant traffic</text>
  <text start="210.959" dur="5.041">declining this is why we see the traffic</text>
  <text start="213.39" dur="4.319">in the malls declining this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216" dur="3.84">not seeing a 1 to 1 ratio where</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="3.601">everything is leaving the</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="4.83">brick-and-mortar stores and moving to</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="6.78">the online structure it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="224.67" dur="4.469">happening and you can see as restaurants</text>
  <text start="228.09" dur="3.989">start to break down</text>
  <text start="229.139" dur="4.38">well that really paints the entire</text>
  <text start="232.079" dur="4.231">picture for us because it lets us know</text>
  <text start="233.519" dur="6.03">that it has nothing to do with online</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="5.37">sales something else is happening and if</text>
  <text start="239.549" dur="3.81">you look at the stats and you go back a</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="4.229">little bit you can see that in the</text>
  <text start="243.359" dur="4.561">beginning of this Fayette system guess</text>
  <text start="245.909" dur="3.72">what wages were increasing we had</text>
  <text start="247.92" dur="3.629">inflation interest rates were high at</text>
  <text start="249.629" dur="5.431">the end of the cycle at the end of the</text>
  <text start="251.549" dur="5.31">entire Fiat cycle what do we have wages</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="4.59">declining interest rates at the lowest</text>
  <text start="256.859" dur="5.25">point ever debt at the highest level</text>
  <text start="259.65" dur="3.989">we&amp;#39;ve ever seen and everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.109" dur="3.391">starting to break down because the</text>
  <text start="263.639" dur="4.741">everyday person is completely tapped out</text>
  <text start="265.5" dur="4.38">and broke we see that mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="268.38" dur="2.009">right now and this is going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="269.88" dur="3.9">problem</text>
  <text start="270.389" dur="7.081">this is housing bubble number 2 and the</text>
  <text start="273.78" dur="5.609">rates are moving up they are at 4.7 3%</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="4.5">now in a few weeks they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="279.389" dur="4.59">5% and they&amp;#39;re gonna be 6% and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="281.97" dur="5.129">gonna throw a lot of individuals out of</text>
  <text start="283.979" dur="5.481">the mortgage arena where they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="287.099" dur="4.411">going to be able to afford a house and</text>
  <text start="289.46" dur="4.179">this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing mortgage</text>
  <text start="291.51" dur="4.379">applications continually decline and</text>
  <text start="293.639" dur="4.861">this is going to continue on as time</text>
  <text start="295.889" dur="6.03">goes on we&amp;#39;ve seen this before this is</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="6.419">nothing new we seen this prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="301.919" dur="6.03">back in 2006 going into 2007 actually</text>
  <text start="304.919" dur="4.981">starting in 2005 we saw the Fed they</text>
  <text start="307.949" dur="4.201">were raising the rates and guess what</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="4.94">happened those people in the adjust &amp;#39;el</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="5.579">and in the adjustable rate mortgage</text>
  <text start="314.84" dur="5.34">mortgages they&amp;#39;re living in their homes</text>
  <text start="317.729" dur="4.19">the rates start to move up that</text>
  <text start="320.18" dur="4.26">tried to lock in it was just too</text>
  <text start="321.919" dur="3.87">expensive they left their homes those</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="3.03">people that were trying to purchase</text>
  <text start="325.789" dur="4.231">homes well it kicked them out of the</text>
  <text start="327.47" dur="4.979">market completely and the Fed kept on</text>
  <text start="330.02" dur="4.5">raising the rates and that started the</text>
  <text start="332.449" dur="5.371">domino effect in the entire system</text>
  <text start="334.52" dur="4.769">started a breakdown and we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="337.82" dur="3.569">same exact thing and then of course as</text>
  <text start="339.289" dur="3.66">the system&amp;#39;s breaking down you find out</text>
  <text start="341.389" dur="2.971">the truth about everything else the</text>
  <text start="342.949" dur="3.511">subprime securities well that was a</text>
  <text start="344.36" dur="4.17">complete lie all these company that were</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="3.81">contained and there&amp;#39;s no problems with</text>
  <text start="348.53" dur="3.78">them there were huge problems they</text>
  <text start="350.27" dur="4.38">needed huge bailouts banks needed huge</text>
  <text start="352.31" dur="5.669">bailouts everything was a complete mess</text>
  <text start="354.65" dur="5.76">but up to that point the Fed the</text>
  <text start="357.979" dur="4.351">government everyone believed what they</text>
  <text start="360.41" dur="4.02">were saying that yeah everything is</text>
  <text start="362.33" dur="3.66">great well everything was great until it</text>
  <text start="364.43" dur="4.68">wasn&amp;#39;t and then you learned that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="365.99" dur="6.239">been lying all this time and everything</text>
  <text start="369.11" dur="6.33">they told us well it was the opposite</text>
  <text start="372.229" dur="5.97">that was happening we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="375.44" dur="7.53">thing happened once again and here we</text>
  <text start="378.199" dur="7.681">are today and the pension crisis is much</text>
  <text start="382.97" dur="6.99">worse than we ever thought now this is</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="7.65">written by Aaron Brown saying that today</text>
  <text start="389.96" dur="5.07">this the heart stop is five to ten years</text>
  <text start="393.53" dur="3.6">within the career plans of current</text>
  <text start="395.03" dur="4.41">officials in the next decade and</text>
  <text start="397.13" dur="5.43">probably within five years some large</text>
  <text start="399.44" dur="7.46">states are going to face insolvency due</text>
  <text start="402.56" dur="7.26">to pensions absent major changes if we</text>
  <text start="406.9" dur="6.25">extrapolate from the past rather than</text>
  <text start="409.82" dur="5.7">use promises in the state budget current</text>
  <text start="413.15" dur="5.699">employees plus the state will contribute</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="5.34">about 25 billion over those seven years</text>
  <text start="418.849" dur="5.521">which could provide another few years</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="5.94">before the till is empty but it will</text>
  <text start="424.37" dur="5.549">also add around sixty billion of future</text>
  <text start="426.8" dur="6.149">liabilities to current employees the</text>
  <text start="429.919" dur="5.84">system probably breaks down before the</text>
  <text start="432.949" dur="5.761">pension fund gets to zero for example if</text>
  <text start="435.759" dur="4.991">assets were to fall below thirty billion</text>
  <text start="438.71" dur="5.28">while projected future liabilities</text>
  <text start="440.75" dur="5.34">exceeded three hundred billion even the</text>
  <text start="443.99" dur="3.75">most optimistic people would have to</text>
  <text start="446.09" dur="4.829">admit the situation is unsustainable</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="5.579">this could happen in three years in a</text>
  <text start="450.919" dur="6.36">bad stock market or perhaps</text>
  <text start="453.319" dur="6.03">10 with good stock returns now think</text>
  <text start="457.279" dur="4.26">about what he&amp;#39;s saying right here if we</text>
  <text start="459.349" dur="6.391">had a bad stock market if the market</text>
  <text start="461.539" dur="5.88">turned down right now three years all</text>
  <text start="465.74" dur="4.049">those people that were expecting their</text>
  <text start="467.419" dur="4.321">pensions they&amp;#39;re not going to be there</text>
  <text start="469.789" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re gonna get pennies on the dollar</text>
  <text start="471.74" dur="8.519">and if the market continually declines</text>
  <text start="476.029" dur="7.23">and credit freezes up and there are</text>
  <text start="480.259" dur="4.47">other problems in the economy guess what</text>
  <text start="483.259" dur="4.89">I don&amp;#39;t think the pensions are going to</text>
  <text start="484.729" dur="5.19">be there at all and most of the older</text>
  <text start="488.149" dur="4.44">generation they&amp;#39;re gonna be sitting</text>
  <text start="489.919" dur="5.011">there going where is all my money what</text>
  <text start="492.589" dur="5.1">happened to it and if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="494.93" dur="6.419">earning money and spending it out in the</text>
  <text start="497.689" dur="5.491">economy and the younger generation they</text>
  <text start="501.349" dur="4.731">don&amp;#39;t have jobs they&amp;#39;re not earning the</text>
  <text start="503.18" dur="7.289">wages what happens to the economy</text>
  <text start="506.08" dur="7.809">everything starts to fall apart this</text>
  <text start="510.469" dur="7.38">situation that we&amp;#39;re in is built on an</text>
  <text start="513.889" dur="5.491">illusion just like prior to 2008 when</text>
  <text start="517.849" dur="3.54">they told us that everything was fine</text>
  <text start="519.38" dur="6.449">that everything was fantastic it was</text>
  <text start="521.389" dur="8.18">built on a lie they took that lie in</text>
  <text start="525.829" dur="6.901">2008 and they created the biggest</text>
  <text start="529.569" dur="8.26">illusion that we have ever seen in our</text>
  <text start="532.73" dur="9.659">lifetime they&amp;#39;ve created an economy made</text>
  <text start="537.829" dur="7.971">up of fake data fake information to make</text>
  <text start="542.389" dur="5.39">us believe that we have recovered</text>
  <text start="545.8" dur="5.56">nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="547.779" dur="6.221">everything is exactly the same actually</text>
  <text start="551.36" dur="4.229">it&amp;#39;s much worse because they didn&amp;#39;t fit</text>
  <text start="554" dur="4.92">the property didn&amp;#39;t fix the problems all</text>
  <text start="555.589" dur="5.85">they did was add more and more debt to</text>
  <text start="558.92" dur="6.09">the system we know the banks are</text>
  <text start="561.439" dur="6.33">insolvent we know the European banks are</text>
  <text start="565.01" dur="4.769">insolvent we know these stress tests</text>

  <text start="571.579" dur="5.281">fake phony and false to make us believe</text>
  <text start="573.079" dur="5.971">that everything is fine and we know one</text>
  <text start="576.86" dur="4.56">small hiccup and we know this from the</text>

  <text start="581.42" dur="4.5">been warning that there is too much debt</text>

  <text start="587.15" dur="4.05">laughs the countries they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="588.74" dur="4.56">collapse everything because everyone</text>
  <text start="591.2" dur="3.66">will point the fingers at them they like</text>

  <text start="631.04" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;ve made their money during a period</text>
  <text start="633.08" dur="7.5">where we had incredible inflation high</text>
  <text start="637.67" dur="4.56">interest rates in the 70s where people</text>
  <text start="640.58" dur="6.75">were getting incredible returns on their</text>
