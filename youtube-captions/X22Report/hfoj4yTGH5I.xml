  <text start="34.079" dur="4.111">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="35.309" dur="5.551">episode 1094 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="38.19" dur="4.92">october 6 2016 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="40.86" dur="5.94">episode is countries are now preparing</text>
  <text start="43.11" dur="6.78">for an economic crisis let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="46.8" dur="5.009">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="49.89" dur="4.46">today we can see that gold was</text>
  <text start="51.809" dur="7.381">suppressed once again and we know from</text>
  <text start="54.35" dur="7.75">the court ruling that the suppression of</text>
  <text start="59.19" dur="6.33">gold is just not by chance we know that</text>
  <text start="62.1" dur="6.6">banks central banks they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="65.52" dur="4.53">it for quite a while and we can see that</text>
  <text start="68.7" dur="4.47">gold is continually being brought down</text>
  <text start="70.05" dur="5.459">and this is an indicator that something</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="5.85">is going to happen most likely some type</text>
  <text start="75.509" dur="5.791">of financial event and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="79.02" dur="6.72">hear calls from the central bankers</text>
  <text start="81.3" dur="6.989">where they want additional rules they</text>
  <text start="85.74" dur="5.76">want additional power they want</text>
  <text start="88.289" dur="6.36">legislation passed and they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="7.53">about debt restructuring or getting rid</text>
  <text start="94.649" dur="6">of bad loans now we need to think about</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="3.69">this for a second why would they be</text>
  <text start="100.649" dur="4.11">doing this at this point well we realize</text>
  <text start="102.72" dur="5.069">that the world has about a hundred and</text>
  <text start="104.759" dur="7.92">fifty two trillion or so worth of debt</text>
  <text start="107.789" dur="8.961">worldwide debt this is a huge number and</text>
  <text start="112.679" dur="7.261">they realize that this debt problem is a</text>
  <text start="116.75" dur="6.009">major problem because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="119.94" dur="5.76">company countries to go under because</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="6.961">that will show the central bank through</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="7.5">debt collapsed a country they need</text>
  <text start="129.72" dur="5.28">countries to barely stay afloat so they</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="4.789">can get continually give them more and</text>
  <text start="135" dur="5.099">more debt to keep them under control and</text>
  <text start="137.989" dur="5.14">this is why the United States Secretary</text>
  <text start="140.099" dur="7.261">of Treasury Jack Lew that&amp;#39;s why he wants</text>
  <text start="143.129" dur="5.701">a restructuring now in Greece he says</text>
  <text start="147.36" dur="5.099">the only solution decreases debt</text>
  <text start="148.83" dur="6.09">problems would be restructure it he said</text>
  <text start="152.459" dur="6.211">any delays would only make the situation</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="5.73">more difficult later on so what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="5.66">really saying right now is there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="6.38">huge problem in greece greece right now</text>
  <text start="164.33" dur="5.91">is going to go under it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="167.03" dur="5.91">collapse unless the debt is restructured</text>
  <text start="170.24" dur="5.94">this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing for a slight</text>
  <text start="172.94" dur="6.06">debt restructuring not to completely</text>
  <text start="176.18" dur="5.58">wipe it out but to allow Greece to</text>
  <text start="179" dur="4.5">survive and of course many people think</text>
  <text start="181.76" dur="3.06">like oh this is fantastic they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="183.5" dur="3.09">to let Greece survive there trying to</text>
  <text start="184.82" dur="4.98">help no they&amp;#39;re trying to keep their</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="5.7">system intact they don&amp;#39;t want to show</text>
  <text start="189.8" dur="5.58">the world that through their policies</text>
  <text start="192.29" dur="4.71">they collapsed a country they can&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="195.38" dur="3.3">that happen because the rest of the</text>
  <text start="197" dur="3.15">world the rest of the countries are</text>
  <text start="198.68" dur="3.27">going to look at the central bank and</text>
  <text start="200.15" dur="5.04">say whoa wait a minute what just</text>
  <text start="201.95" dur="5.82">happened here you kept on piling debt</text>
  <text start="205.19" dur="4.89">and on debt on debt on debt on Greece</text>
  <text start="207.77" dur="6.12">and you brought the country to its knees</text>
  <text start="210.08" dur="6.9">and all the austerity didn&amp;#39;t help we</text>
  <text start="213.89" dur="7.05">don&amp;#39;t want the same thing and this is</text>
  <text start="216.98" dur="9.81">why they&amp;#39;re pushing so hard because the</text>
  <text start="220.94" dur="9.03">world right now is suffocating from all</text>
  <text start="226.79" dur="6.83">this debt they know there&amp;#39;s not enough</text>
  <text start="229.97" dur="6">revenue out there to pay for all of this</text>
  <text start="233.62" dur="4.6">people are losing jobs left and right</text>
  <text start="235.97" dur="4.769">and as more and more people lose left</text>
  <text start="238.22" dur="4.17">and right and as more austerity where do</text>
  <text start="240.739" dur="3.691">you get the revenue to pay for the</text>
  <text start="242.39" dur="4.68">interest on this debt well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="3.779">non-existent and this is the problem</text>
  <text start="247.07" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re running into actually that the</text>
  <text start="248.209" dur="6.721">system the central bankers system is</text>
  <text start="250.31" dur="8.399">designed to fail it can never ever work</text>
  <text start="254.93" dur="6.48">in this way and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.709" dur="4.921">having the problem right now and they</text>
  <text start="261.41" dur="4.23">know eventually the system will just</text>
  <text start="263.63" dur="3.21">come down by itself and they can&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="265.64" dur="3.24">that happen so they need to keep the</text>
  <text start="266.84" dur="4.29">illusion alive that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="268.88" dur="4.67">keep people in the dark that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="271.13" dur="4.98">like to do until the very last minute</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="4.33">when the whole thing comes down and even</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="3.72">when it comes down they&amp;#39;re going to tell</text>
  <text start="277.88" dur="3.45">you everything is fine the things that</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="3.48">you need to worry about with government</text>
  <text start="281.33" dur="4.92">is when they make a really big deal</text>
  <text start="283.31" dur="5.16">about something that&amp;#39;s not the problem</text>
  <text start="286.25" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s when they&amp;#39;re very quiet and they</text>
  <text start="288.47" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t let the public know about things</text>
  <text start="290.69" dur="5.01">that aren&amp;#39;t happening things that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.36" dur="4.47">talking about they never mention it</text>
  <text start="295.7" dur="3.48">those are the things that you need to</text>
  <text start="297.83" dur="2.94">really worried about because everything</text>
  <text start="299.18" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re blowing out of proportion is a</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="8.28">distraction to distract you away from</text>
  <text start="304.34" dur="6.68">what&amp;#39;s real from what&amp;#39;s important I mean</text>
  <text start="309.05" dur="4.77">right now we see initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="311.02" dur="5.23">they&amp;#39;re continually meal manipulating</text>
  <text start="313.82" dur="5.46">this initial jobless claims are at the</text>
  <text start="316.25" dur="5.22">lowest level since 1973 and most people</text>
  <text start="319.28" dur="5.52">say wow this is amazing look at this no</text>
  <text start="321.47" dur="5.19">one is claiming unemployment everything</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="4.68">is great but really what&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="326.66" dur="5.37">more and more people are being laid off</text>
  <text start="329.48" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re unemployed and when you look</text>
  <text start="332.03" dur="7.71">back in time you see the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="335.84" dur="8.01">claims every time they&amp;#39;ve reached low</text>
  <text start="339.74" dur="8.28">levels like this about a couple months</text>
  <text start="343.85" dur="7.62">later we have a major recession</text>
  <text start="348.02" dur="17.34">depression and when you look back in</text>
  <text start="351.47" dur="16.86">time back to 1975 1980 1991 2001 2007 8</text>
  <text start="365.36" dur="5.43">we were at the lowest points in initial</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="6.69">jobless claims and a couple of months</text>
  <text start="370.79" dur="6.15">later all of a sudden the initial</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="5.85">jobless claims shot up and we went into</text>
  <text start="376.94" dur="9.24">some type of recession right now we are</text>
  <text start="380.87" dur="9.71">at the lowest point since 1973 which</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="7.62">tells us that we are headed for a</text>
  <text start="390.58" dur="7.09">complete collapse of the system because</text>
  <text start="393.8" dur="6.39">we are already in a recession and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.67" dur="5.31">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="400.19" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s not getting better the economy is</text>
  <text start="402.98" dur="6.35">not improving but they want us to</text>
  <text start="405.59" dur="7.65">believe that initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="409.33" dur="6.4">they&amp;#39;re continually declining how can</text>
  <text start="413.24" dur="4.94">this be when us factory orders are</text>
  <text start="415.73" dur="7.76">continually declining retail is</text>
  <text start="418.18" dur="5.31">contracting corporations are laying off</text>
  <text start="423.61" dur="4.09">something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense something</text>
  <text start="425.75" dur="4.06">doesn&amp;#39;t fit into this model and very</text>
  <text start="427.7" dur="5.74">interestingly and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="429.81" dur="6.359">in 2013 United States because of budget</text>
  <text start="433.44" dur="6.21">constraints of course they hadn&amp;#39;t let go</text>
  <text start="436.169" dur="7.431">that of that department that looked at</text>
  <text start="439.65" dur="7.17">layoffs that collected the layoff data</text>
  <text start="443.6" dur="7.24">they just closed that department but we</text>
  <text start="446.82" dur="7.17">know they had the money because last the</text>
  <text start="450.84" dur="5.67">this year 2016 they already borrowed</text>
  <text start="453.99" dur="5.46">about 1.4 trillion we don&amp;#39;t know where</text>
  <text start="456.51" dur="4.86">that money actually went most likely not</text>
  <text start="459.45" dur="3.27">here in the United States because we</text>
  <text start="461.37" dur="4.44">mentioned it before that we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="462.72" dur="4.74">any improvements throughout the United</text>
  <text start="465.81" dur="3.419">States so we know this went to foreign</text>
  <text start="467.46" dur="4.26">governments we went it went to the war</text>
  <text start="469.229" dur="3.991">and went to many other places but</text>
  <text start="471.72" dur="4.89">challenger grain Christmas which is a</text>
  <text start="473.22" dur="6.24">private firm they report on what is</text>
  <text start="476.61" dur="6">going on in the United States and how</text>
  <text start="479.46" dur="6.57">many layoffs there are and they</text>
  <text start="482.61" dur="10.2">announced that layoffs have jumped 38%</text>
  <text start="486.03" dur="9.449">from the August count 240 4324 and what</text>
  <text start="492.81" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re saying right now is that layoffs</text>
  <text start="495.479" dur="7.651">are up and most of them are coming from</text>
  <text start="499.59" dur="6.87">the education industry job losses have</text>
  <text start="503.13" dur="6.3">quadrupled to 8,000 671 the computer</text>
  <text start="506.46" dur="7.019">industry last month laid off about 4152</text>
  <text start="509.43" dur="10.77">jobs and we see that the energy sector</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="10.62">laid off about 59,000 719 so when we</text>
  <text start="520.2" dur="7.65">look at this we see that the job cuts</text>
  <text start="524.099" dur="7.591">were around 90 8733 people that were</text>
  <text start="527.85" dur="7.59">laid off retailers they announced</text>
  <text start="531.69" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re laying off 7290 six jobs but</text>
  <text start="535.44" dur="6.39">they continually tell us that retail is</text>
  <text start="536.94" dur="9">expanding it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense we see</text>
  <text start="541.83" dur="6.509">countries right now they are preparing</text>
  <text start="545.94" dur="4.86">for this economic crisis they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.339" dur="5.641">preparing for what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="550.8" dur="4.53">world and we see the Dutch central bank</text>
  <text start="553.98" dur="5.07">well they&amp;#39;re going to be moving their</text>
  <text start="555.33" dur="7.92">gold from Amsterdam to a former military</text>
  <text start="559.05" dur="6.93">air base and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="563.25" dur="5.82">the Dutch central bank the Netherlands</text>
  <text start="565.98" dur="6.6">they repatriated 122 tons of physical</text>
  <text start="569.07" dur="6.84">gold from the New York Fed and it looks</text>
  <text start="572.58" dur="6.3">like right now they&amp;#39;re moving it to keep</text>
  <text start="575.91" dur="7.5">it protected for security measures</text>
  <text start="578.88" dur="6.84">necessary to guard their gold and we can</text>
  <text start="583.41" dur="4.41">see right now that countries they are</text>
  <text start="585.72" dur="4.83">asking for their gold back they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="587.82" dur="4.74">moving it to secret locations to keep it</text>
  <text start="590.55" dur="3.78">safe because we can see what is</text>
  <text start="592.56" dur="6.44">happening around the world we see an</text>
  <text start="594.33" dur="8.79">economic crisis we see war we see many</text>
  <text start="599" dur="10.44">geopolitical problems around Europe in</text>
  <text start="603.12" dur="9.87">the United States and the situation is</text>
  <text start="609.44" dur="7.36">deteriorating very very quickly and we</text>
  <text start="612.99" dur="7.26">know these central bankers they want to</text>
  <text start="616.8" dur="5.67">take control of countries I mean their</text>
  <text start="620.25" dur="5.91">ultimate goal is a one-world government</text>
  <text start="622.47" dur="6.48">and we can see the internet was signed</text>
  <text start="626.16" dur="5.58">off and moved to the UN which is the</text>
  <text start="628.95" dur="6.42">first piece of the puzzle we understand</text>
  <text start="631.74" dur="7.26">that Obama central bankers the IMF they</text>
  <text start="635.37" dur="6.719">really wanted the TTIP the TT the TPP</text>
  <text start="639" dur="5.91">they wanted all of that past but we can</text>
  <text start="642.089" dur="5.041">see that has been going nowhere so they</text>
  <text start="644.91" dur="4.41">do have a backup trade plan which is</text>
  <text start="647.13" dur="6.72">called seta that is coming out of Canada</text>
  <text start="649.32" dur="9.9">which is pretty much a duplicate of the</text>
  <text start="653.85" dur="8.67">TTIP the TPP and an attempt to keep the</text>
  <text start="659.22" dur="5.43">EU Canada trade deal set on track the</text>
  <text start="662.52" dur="4.41">European Commission has drawn up a</text>
  <text start="664.65" dur="5">declaration aimed at reassuring those</text>
  <text start="666.93" dur="5.52">worried by the implication of the deal</text>
  <text start="669.65" dur="4.51">it was a five-page document which was</text>
  <text start="672.45" dur="3.87">leaked last night and has been</text>
  <text start="674.16" dur="5.13">scrutinized by lawyers and trade experts</text>
  <text start="676.32" dur="7.38">and we can see that these leaked</text>
  <text start="679.29" dur="9.92">documents prove that this entire deal is</text>
  <text start="683.7" dur="8.31">a toxic trade deal just like the TTIP</text>
  <text start="689.21" dur="4.81">and we have to remember why they want</text>
  <text start="692.01" dur="5.129">this so bad this is why why are they</text>
  <text start="694.02" dur="6.869">pushing this so hard</text>
  <text start="697.139" dur="8.31">it allows them to take control of</text>
  <text start="700.889" dur="7.56">governments through the corporate court</text>
  <text start="705.449" dur="7.08">system which through these trade deals</text>
  <text start="708.449" dur="7.29">will override governments and it will</text>
  <text start="712.529" dur="7.08">allow them to tell governments what to</text>
  <text start="715.739" dur="8.06">do so when we put this together the UN</text>
  <text start="719.609" dur="7.89">has control of the internet which is</text>
  <text start="723.799" dur="5.71">control of news that is coming out of</text>
  <text start="727.499" dur="3.21">other sources than the corporate media</text>
  <text start="729.509" dur="2.88">because they already have control of the</text>
  <text start="730.709" dur="3.12">corporate media the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="732.389" dur="4.41">completely controlled by the government</text>
  <text start="733.829" dur="6.391">central bankers the internet now is</text>
  <text start="736.799" dur="7.111">going to be controlled by the UN they</text>
  <text start="740.22" dur="9.269">need seta or the TTP the TTIP or the TPP</text>
  <text start="743.91" dur="7.079">they need that to control governments so</text>
  <text start="749.489" dur="3.72">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="750.989" dur="5.13">trying to create an instance of where</text>
  <text start="753.209" dur="6.66">they can control everything through all</text>
  <text start="756.119" dur="8.101">of this the central banks they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="759.869" dur="8.041">to push the idea of getting control of</text>
  <text start="764.22" dur="6.419">the economy more of it and this is why</text>
  <text start="767.91" dur="5.789">they want to create new rules this is</text>
  <text start="770.639" dur="8.401">why they want legislation this is why</text>
  <text start="773.699" dur="7.591">they&amp;#39;re pushing so hard to convince</text>
  <text start="779.04" dur="3.87">everyone that they need more power and</text>
  <text start="781.29" dur="3.69">this is why we&amp;#39;re going to see the first</text>
  <text start="782.91" dur="4.169">phase of the collapse because they need</text>
