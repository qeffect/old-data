  <text start="91.96" dur="4.409">between 40 to 60 billion euros or it</text>

  <text start="104.44" dur="4.98">can see the negotiations are going to be</text>
  <text start="106.69" dur="3.989">chaotic and we can see that the central</text>
  <text start="109.42" dur="3.809">bankers they&amp;#39;re going to do whatever</text>
  <text start="110.679" dur="5.401">they possibly can to keep every single</text>

  <text start="122.38" dur="4.44">the standard and poors they&amp;#39;ve cut the</text>
  <text start="124.299" dur="6.121">ratings of 23 Australian financial</text>
  <text start="126.82" dur="6.87">institutions including a MP Ben dingo</text>
  <text start="130.42" dur="6.92">the Bank of Queensland citing the risk</text>
  <text start="133.69" dur="6.18">of a sharp fall in property prices</text>
  <text start="137.34" dur="4.63">mortgage lenders in Australia faced a</text>
  <text start="139.87" dur="4.38">surge in bad debts in the event of a</text>
  <text start="141.97" dur="4.38">sharp correction in property prices</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="3.57">given household debt is already high</text>
  <text start="146.35" dur="4.35">this is coming from SNP</text>
  <text start="147.82" dur="5.22">now what they&amp;#39;re saying is that in the</text>
  <text start="150.7" dur="5.34">event of a sudden property market</text>
  <text start="153.04" dur="5.88">correction all financial institutions</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="6.6">operating in Australia are likely to</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="7.08">incur significantly greater credit</text>
  <text start="162.64" dur="5.939">losses than present they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="166" dur="4.95">the property market right now well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.579" dur="5.401">showing signs of cooling down within</text>
  <text start="170.95" dur="5.94">Sydney and Melbourne home prices both</text>
  <text start="173.98" dur="4.349">are starting to slip and it doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="176.89" dur="4.41">good and this is according to core logic</text>
  <text start="178.329" dur="5.731">and they realize that these financial</text>
  <text start="181.3" dur="4.31">institutions well they&amp;#39;re going to slip</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="3.08">as well so</text>
  <text start="185.61" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re already getting prepared for</text>
  <text start="187.14" dur="6.48">this and we can see that we know that</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="5.13">the housing bubble not just here in the</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="4.32">United States and Canada Australia and</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="5.34">many other places well things are</text>
  <text start="197.94" dur="6.84">starting to move the other way in the</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="7.23">other direction and this is not a good</text>
  <text start="204.78" dur="5.22">sign now we&amp;#39;ve been tracking the housing</text>
  <text start="208.11" dur="4.59">market here in the United States in</text>
  <text start="210" dur="5.07">Canada and we can see that things have</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="4.89">been changing where there are many</text>
  <text start="215.07" dur="5.43">markets now where it&amp;#39;s becoming very</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="5.49">very difficult to move the properties in</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="3.69">Miami we&amp;#39;re seeing this as a lot of</text>
  <text start="223.08" dur="3.93">condos on the market a lot of</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="5.28">speculators are out there they purchased</text>
  <text start="227.01" dur="5.04">the condos and now they&amp;#39;re on the market</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="5.64">and they can&amp;#39;t move them so we can see</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s a huge problem out in Greece</text>
  <text start="235.11" dur="5.58">well the situation there is just getting</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="4.86">worse and worse day by day now the Greek</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="4.68">parliament once again approved more</text>
  <text start="242.58" dur="5.55">austerity to unlock the Greek bailout</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="5.19">funds in Brussels but it doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="248.13" dur="3.9">like it&amp;#39;s going to well actually the IMF</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="4.17">the ECB they&amp;#39;re still fighting about</text>
  <text start="252.03" dur="5.16">this and they want Greece to do more so</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="3.93">the Greek finance ministry inspectors</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="4.079">are about to start seeking out the</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="4.86">owners of all local undeclared</text>
  <text start="261.269" dur="4.021">properties what does this mean well</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re going to be looking everywhere</text>
  <text start="265.29" dur="5.25">to get their hands on revenue so the</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="3.89">parliament is going to pass regulations</text>
  <text start="270.54" dur="6.09">permitting the mass confiscation of</text>
  <text start="272.66" dur="7.72">safety deposit box content and financial</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="5.25">assets such as securities to date the</text>
  <text start="280.38" dur="2.789">process has been conducted in</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="3.21">handwriting and is therefore</text>
  <text start="283.169" dur="3.781">particularly sloped and locating the</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="5.1">assets of taxpayers who have either</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="5.34">concealed incomes or have major debts to</text>
  <text start="290.19" dur="4.35">the state the tax authority will be able</text>
  <text start="292.29" dur="4.05">to issue online confiscation notices and</text>
  <text start="294.54" dur="3.54">immediately get their hands on the</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="4.2">contents of a safety deposit box and</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="3">will be able to confiscate the cash the</text>
  <text start="300.54" dur="4.23">stones</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="5.73">jewelry and so on and in my personal</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="4.83">opinion I don&amp;#39;t think you should keep</text>
  <text start="306.81" dur="4.59">anything in the safety deposit box no</text>
  <text start="309.6" dur="2.16">matter where you are here in the United</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="3.5">States</text>
  <text start="311.76" dur="6.36">well DHS does have the right to go into</text>
  <text start="314.9" dur="4.699">safety deposit boxes they did pass a law</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="4.479">going way back</text>
  <text start="319.599" dur="5.011">and we can see right now that they will</text>
  <text start="322.599" dur="4.74">have the ability to go through your</text>
  <text start="324.61" dur="4.349">safety deposit boxes and if you have</text>
  <text start="327.339" dur="3.69">gold if you have cash or you have</text>
  <text start="328.959" dur="5.341">anything that&amp;#39;s valuable in there they</text>
  <text start="331.029" dur="5.461">will take it they will go after it now</text>
  <text start="334.3" dur="4.949">something very interesting happen with</text>
  <text start="336.49" dur="6.209">the student loans there is a bill that</text>
  <text start="339.249" dur="6.78">was introduced that will allow the</text>
  <text start="342.699" dur="7.291">cancellation of over 1 trillion in</text>
  <text start="346.029" dur="6.211">student debt through bankruptcy now this</text>
  <text start="349.99" dur="5.579">is very interesting because as of right</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="6.449">now every single student has to pay</text>
  <text start="355.569" dur="4.89">their student loan and there are certain</text>
  <text start="358.689" dur="3.991">circumstances where you can get out of</text>
  <text start="360.459" dur="7.531">it but you just can&amp;#39;t declare bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="362.68" dur="9.479">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is if</text>
  <text start="367.99" dur="9.149">this bill is allowed and it lets the</text>
  <text start="372.159" dur="6.99">student off the hook the taxpayers well</text>
  <text start="377.139" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re going to flip the bill now the</text>
  <text start="379.149" dur="6.81">question is why do they want to do this</text>
  <text start="382.209" dur="7.05">because you have to remember they need</text>
  <text start="385.959" dur="5.52">to get the funds from someplace and with</text>
  <text start="389.259" dur="3.75">all these students right now who have</text>
  <text start="391.479" dur="3.93">been going back to college who can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="393.009" dur="5.37">find jobs who have loan modifications</text>
  <text start="395.409" dur="5.96">under the current laws they really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="398.379" dur="7.051">do anything they can&amp;#39;t use taxpayer</text>
  <text start="401.369" dur="6.25">bailouts to collect on these loans and</text>
  <text start="405.43" dur="5.519">this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to do this</text>
  <text start="407.619" dur="7.01">now we can see that this is a huge</text>
  <text start="410.949" dur="6.36">amount of money a trillion dollars and</text>
  <text start="414.629" dur="4.81">it&amp;#39;s not just with the student loan</text>
  <text start="417.309" dur="4.14">industry we can see that there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="419.439" dur="4.47">to be bit there well they would need to</text>
  <text start="421.449" dur="4.86">be bailouts for almost everything today</text>
  <text start="423.909" dur="5.67">because when the system crashes once</text>
  <text start="426.309" dur="4.5">again you can bet you that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="429.579" dur="3.57">to be going back to Congress saying</text>
  <text start="430.809" dur="6.35">listen we need bailouts for everything</text>
  <text start="433.149" dur="6.87">and Congress is going to have to decide</text>
  <text start="437.159" dur="5.07">do we bail out all these companies again</text>
  <text start="440.019" dur="5.25">do we bail out all these banks again and</text>
  <text start="442.229" dur="5.29">the bankers they&amp;#39;re really not counting</text>
  <text start="445.269" dur="4.14">on this this is why they created the</text>
  <text start="447.519" dur="3.9">bail in document because they understand</text>
  <text start="449.409" dur="3.311">that they can have to get the funds from</text>
  <text start="451.419" dur="3.401">someplace and that</text>
  <text start="452.72" dur="4.05">going to be from the bank accounts and</text>
  <text start="454.82" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s where they are headed</text>
  <text start="456.77" dur="6.47">actually do you know for every $1 of</text>
  <text start="459.89" dur="6.87">student debt costs American taxpayers</text>
  <text start="463.24" dur="5.68">$38 to collect on that because they hire</text>
  <text start="466.76" dur="5.94">debt collectors to go after these</text>
  <text start="468.92" dur="5.25">individuals now is it the fault of the</text>
  <text start="472.7" dur="4.59">students well they would like to make</text>
  <text start="474.17" dur="6.08">you think that but again they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="477.29" dur="7.92">pushed into the system where the system</text>
  <text start="480.25" dur="7.6">right now does not work so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="485.21" dur="5.76">telling everyone to go back to school to</text>
  <text start="487.85" dur="4.35">take out 20 30 40 50 thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="490.97" dur="2.97">worth of loans because that&amp;#39;s all you</text>
  <text start="492.2" dur="3.69">see all over the TV go back to school</text>
  <text start="493.94" dur="3.45">get a great job and you come out of</text>
  <text start="495.89" dur="4.11">school and I know a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="4.23">have been graduating and they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="500" dur="3.71">work actually living with their parents</text>
  <text start="501.62" dur="6.21">they have a couple part-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="503.71" dur="6.52">they can&amp;#39;t find any type of real work so</text>
  <text start="507.83" dur="3.63">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that all</text>
  <text start="510.23" dur="2.73">these individuals and this is why</text>
  <text start="511.46" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;ve been modifying all the student</text>
  <text start="512.96" dur="3.66">loans because they had to stretch it out</text>
  <text start="514.61" dur="6.299">over time then they had to base it on</text>
  <text start="516.62" dur="6.419">the income of the student because they</text>
  <text start="520.909" dur="4.171">realized that there are no jobs out</text>
  <text start="523.039" dur="5.55">there they make you think there&amp;#39;s plenty</text>
  <text start="525.08" dur="5.009">of jobs but the majority of people who</text>
  <text start="528.589" dur="2.971">are coming out of college there aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="530.089" dur="4.201">any extra that was one College where</text>
  <text start="531.56" dur="4.83">students actually sued because the</text>
  <text start="534.29" dur="4.35">majority of them couldn&amp;#39;t even find jobs</text>
  <text start="536.39" dur="3.9">and they were being promised that yes</text>
  <text start="538.64" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;ll get a job if you attend this of</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="5.48">you go back to school you will you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="8.21">get work and none of them actually did</text>
  <text start="545.77" dur="8.02">now there&amp;#39;s a New York bankruptcy judge</text>
  <text start="550.75" dur="6.31">who said that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing a surge</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="6.96">in chapter 11 and chapter 15 filings and</text>
  <text start="557.06" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;ve exploded like crazy and this is</text>
  <text start="560.75" dur="6.72">coming out of New York and the judge is</text>
  <text start="563.81" dur="5.97">Shelley Chapman saying that chapter 11</text>
  <text start="567.47" dur="5.13">have tripled in the first quarter of</text>
  <text start="569.78" dur="4.29">this year while chapter 15s for</text>
  <text start="572.6" dur="3.3">companies seeking US aid for</text>
  <text start="574.07" dur="5.19">reorganization in a foreign Court have</text>
  <text start="575.9" dur="5.939">increased Sevenfold now this is all</text>
  <text start="579.26" dur="4.86">coming from the retailers and remember</text>
  <text start="581.839" dur="4.021">the retailers that we&amp;#39;re reporting on</text>
  <text start="584.12" dur="3.45">are just the</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="3.78">stores but we&amp;#39;re not talking about the</text>
  <text start="587.57" dur="4.37">smaller stores where maybe there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="589.64" dur="5.4">store or two stores and that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="591.94" dur="4.839">because there&amp;#39;s a lot of those and those</text>
  <text start="595.04" dur="2.31">are going out of business too they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="596.779" dur="3.06">make it either</text>
  <text start="597.35" dur="4.59">and we&amp;#39;re seeing a surge in all this so</text>
  <text start="599.839" dur="4.62">when we talk about 50 bankruptcies we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="601.94" dur="4.74">only talking about the big chain</text>
  <text start="604.459" dur="6.12">retailers we&amp;#39;re not even talking about</text>
  <text start="606.68" dur="5.94">the small mom-and-pop ones so we can see</text>
  <text start="610.579" dur="3.75">right now that the economy and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="612.62" dur="4.11">been watching this for quite a while it</text>
  <text start="614.329" dur="4.651">is deteriorating and we can see the</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="4.47">decline is accelerating right now and</text>
  <text start="618.98" dur="5.729">things are actually not improving</text>
  <text start="621.2" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re actually getting worse and this</text>
  <text start="624.709" dur="5.521">is all being done right now on purpose</text>
  <text start="627.86" dur="4.169">because the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="630.23" dur="3.87">understand that the economy was never</text>
  <text start="632.029" dur="5.331">going to be able to work like this Trump</text>
  <text start="634.1" dur="6.51">realizes that well listen I tried to</text>
  <text start="637.36" dur="6.099">work with what we have right now it is</text>
  <text start="640.61" dur="5.789">not going to work out the system needs</text>
  <text start="643.459" dur="4.411">to be crashed and the people need to</text>
  <text start="646.399" dur="3.531">take control of it now the central</text>
  <text start="647.87" dur="4.95">bankers on the other hand they need to</text>
  <text start="649.93" dur="5.469">collapse the system and they need to</text>
  <text start="652.82" dur="4.769">take control this and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="655.399" dur="4.531">more signs of things where they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="657.589" dur="6.841">going very well remember we talked about</text>
  <text start="659.93" dur="6.029">loan creation well low in creation right</text>
  <text start="664.43" dur="7.019">now and this is according to the latest</text>
  <text start="665.959" dur="8.461">fed data it is crashed more than it ever</text>
  <text start="671.449" dur="7.411">has since the Great Recession actually</text>
  <text start="674.42" dur="8.039">we are below the point of where it</text>
  <text start="678.86" dur="5.64">happened during the Great Recession so</text>
  <text start="682.459" dur="6.151">the situation is actually getting worse</text>
  <text start="684.5" dur="5.64">and once we see this downward trend we</text>
  <text start="688.61" dur="5.669">know we&amp;#39;re heading into something that</text>
  <text start="690.14" dur="6.78">is not going to end well at all and what</text>
  <text start="694.279" dur="5.521">we look at when we look at commercial</text>
  <text start="696.92" dur="5.22">real estate loans over the past year we</text>
  <text start="699.8" dur="5.37">see that banks are reporting weaker</text>
  <text start="702.14" dur="5.759">demand for the CRE loans in the first</text>
  <text start="705.17" dur="8.07">quarter now we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="707.899" dur="11.701">going all the way back to 1990 to 1991</text>
  <text start="713.24" dur="11.07">92 we saw this happening in 2000 2001</text>
  <text start="719.6" dur="9.75">- so that&amp;#39;s happening in 2008 2009 2010</text>
  <text start="724.31" dur="8.43">and here we are once again and we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="729.35" dur="5.789">the same exact spot where we have hit</text>
  <text start="732.74" dur="6.36">the top and now it&amp;#39;s coming down and</text>
  <text start="735.139" dur="7.43">it&amp;#39;s following the same exact pattern so</text>
  <text start="739.1" dur="6.239">this tells us that we are heading into a</text>
  <text start="742.569" dur="4.811">collapse of the system we&amp;#39;re already in</text>

  <text start="752.93" dur="5.07">they will not tell you you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="755.269" dur="4.891">recession until we&amp;#39;re months into the</text>
  <text start="758" dur="4.139">recession then they go backwards in time</text>
  <text start="760.16" dur="5.609">and they say yes we shed the recession</text>
  <text start="762.139" dur="4.401">started back in 2016 in the month of</text>
  <text start="765.769" dur="5.19">August</text>
  <text start="766.54" dur="7.06">now they report on that in December of</text>

  <text start="776.8" dur="6.76">leading up to the 2008 crash in October</text>
  <text start="780.31" dur="6.219">but they didn&amp;#39;t report on it until 2009</text>
  <text start="783.56" dur="5.879">and they go backward in time and they</text>
  <text start="786.529" dur="4.05">let you know when it all started but</text>
  <text start="789.439" dur="3.15">we&amp;#39;ve been watching it we&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="848.809" dur="4.051">come out and tell you that the whole</text>
  <text start="850.189" dur="3.321">thing is collapsing Trump has alluded</text>
  <text start="852.86" dur="2.17">that</text>
  <text start="853.51" dur="4.62">our problems the economy is a mess</text>
  <text start="855.03" dur="5.32">everything&amp;#39;s in a bubble letting you</text>
  <text start="858.13" dur="4.89">know that there are problems behind the</text>
  <text start="860.35" dur="4.92">scenes so how you prepare a country well</text>
  <text start="863.02" dur="4.5">most of the country since we&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="865.27" dur="4.95">this kind of fabulous recovery most of</text>
  <text start="867.52" dur="6.15">the people well they&amp;#39;re on a lot of</text>
  <text start="870.22" dur="5.91">entitlement programs and when we have</text>
  <text start="873.67" dur="5.97">this collapse all of this is going to go</text>
  <text start="876.13" dur="4.08">away I mean it&amp;#39;s just going to cease to</text>
  <text start="879.64" dur="3.69">exist</text>
  <text start="880.21" dur="6.15">and I&amp;#39;m talking about Medicare Medicaid</text>
  <text start="883.33" dur="5.34">I&amp;#39;m talking about food stamps I mean</text>
  <text start="886.36" dur="5.61">think about it if the government goes</text>
  <text start="888.67" dur="7.71">down and we&amp;#39;re in this collapse</text>
  <text start="891.97" dur="7.26">situation the currency is devalued they</text>
  <text start="896.38" dur="5.55">can&amp;#39;t support in any of this Trump</text>
  <text start="899.23" dur="7.8">realizes this he understands this this</text>
  <text start="901.93" dur="5.99">is why he&amp;#39;s cutting entitlements by 1.7</text>
  <text start="907.03" dur="5.61">trillion</text>
  <text start="907.92" dur="7.3">cutting food stamps by 25 percent trying</text>
  <text start="912.64" dur="5.46">to get as many people off of this as</text>
  <text start="915.22" dur="6.39">possible because what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="918.1" dur="8.48">is that everyone is going to be on their</text>
  <text start="921.61" dur="8">own the nanny state will no longer exist</text>
  <text start="926.58" dur="5.74">the founding fathers of this country</text>
  <text start="929.61" dur="5.89">didn&amp;#39;t want the government to support</text>
  <text start="932.32" dur="7.56">every single person the government was</text>
  <text start="935.5" dur="7.65">just to basically administer the country</text>
  <text start="939.88" dur="5.97">not to create armies not to create</text>
  <text start="943.15" dur="5.73">career politicians not to give them</text>
  <text start="945.85" dur="5.76">pensions health benefits to create all</text>
  <text start="948.88" dur="4.8">these entitlement programs the</text>
  <text start="951.61" dur="5.25">government was only to do the</text>
  <text start="953.68" dur="6.87">administration work that&amp;#39;s it and the</text>
  <text start="956.86" dur="6.15">people would have to work and figure it</text>
  <text start="960.55" dur="4.35">all out now people are saying well how</text>
  <text start="963.01" dur="5.85">can we do this well you have to remember</text>
  <text start="964.9" dur="7.14">the system was taken over the system was</text>
  <text start="968.86" dur="4.71">created and put together where the</text>
  <text start="972.04" dur="5.49">government would have to take care of</text>
  <text start="973.57" dur="8.55">the people the central bank did this to</text>
  <text start="977.53" dur="6.87">the entire country by loaning currency</text>
  <text start="982.12" dur="4.61">out with its interest attached by</text>
  <text start="984.4" dur="2.33">allowing</text>
  <text start="986.94" dur="7.65">currency to be continually printed with</text>
  <text start="990.87" dur="5.94">no checks and balances which meant that</text>
  <text start="994.59" dur="4.62">a lot of people were going to lose work</text>
  <text start="996.81" dur="4.65">which meant the value of the dollar was</text>
  <text start="999.21" dur="5.73">going to decrease which meant that</text>
  <text start="1001.46" dur="6.45">things were going to become worse as</text>
  <text start="1004.94" dur="4.23">time went on and if you go back to 1971</text>
  <text start="1007.91" dur="3.3">even you go back a little bit further</text>
  <text start="1009.17" dur="4.53">than that but from 1971 you can really</text>
  <text start="1011.21" dur="5.19">see it going forward coming out of the</text>
  <text start="1013.7" dur="4.74">90s going into 2000 if you remember on</text>
  <text start="1016.4" dur="4.29">the news they said oh the middle-class</text>
  <text start="1018.44" dur="5.04">you know that&amp;#39;s going to disappear</text>
  <text start="1020.69" dur="5.009">things are not going to work out and we</text>
  <text start="1023.48" dur="4.08">could see that inflation was hitting</text>
  <text start="1025.699" dur="4.021">that means the value of the dollar was</text>
  <text start="1027.56" dur="5.759">continually decreasing and this</text>
  <text start="1029.72" dur="7.44">continually went on over time here we</text>
  <text start="1033.319" dur="6.061">are in 2017 were at the end stages of</text>
  <text start="1037.16" dur="4.02">the economy that&amp;#39;s why you see wages</text>
  <text start="1039.38" dur="3.87">decreasing this is why you see the</text>
  <text start="1041.18" dur="3.84">interest rates at 0% look at the</text>
  <text start="1043.25" dur="6.44">beginning when we first came off the</text>
  <text start="1045.02" dur="8.39">gold standard in 71 interest rates were</text>
  <text start="1049.69" dur="6.34">what 15 16 17 18 percent</text>
  <text start="1053.41" dur="4.33">well that was to keep up with the</text>
  <text start="1056.03" dur="3.69">creation of all the currency coming up</text>
  <text start="1057.74" dur="6.21">off the gold standard because it was</text>
  <text start="1059.72" dur="7.08">being devalued wages were increasing</text>
  <text start="1063.95" dur="5.31">house values were increasing today what</text>
  <text start="1066.8" dur="5.31">do we say house values increasing</text>
  <text start="1069.26" dur="5.13">because of bubbles wages decreasing</text>
  <text start="1072.11" dur="5.24">interest rates as low as possible</text>
  <text start="1074.39" dur="5.25">no one&amp;#39;s making anything on savings</text>
  <text start="1077.35" dur="5.47">everyone has to be forced into the</text>
  <text start="1079.64" dur="5.64">market a stock market because that is</text>
  <text start="1082.82" dur="5.07">the only thing that the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1085.28" dur="3.96">have full control of manipulating to</text>
  <text start="1087.89" dur="3.9">make you think that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="1089.24" dur="6.36">well so the system was basically</text>
  <text start="1091.79" dur="6.36">designed not to last for this period of</text>
  <text start="1095.6" dur="4.59">time and to keep everyone happy they had</text>
  <text start="1098.15" dur="6">to come up with entitlement programs</text>
  <text start="1100.19" dur="6.66">food stamps because how else could</text>
  <text start="1104.15" dur="4.62">people support themselves if there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1106.85" dur="4.32">enough jobs if the currency is</text>
  <text start="1108.77" dur="4.98">continually being devalued if housing</text>
  <text start="1111.17" dur="4.259">prices continually rise we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1113.75" dur="4.71">inflation because the value of the</text>
  <text start="1115.429" dur="5.041">dollar continually Falls and as it</text>
  <text start="1118.46" dur="5.64">continually Falls it just gets worse</text>
  <text start="1120.47" dur="6.48">worse and worse so how do you prepare</text>
  <text start="1124.1" dur="6.66">everyone for a collapse well you have to</text>
  <text start="1126.95" dur="6.69">get them off the system you have to make</text>
  <text start="1130.76" dur="5.399">it less of a shock now is it going to</text>
  <text start="1133.64" dur="4.83">work most likely not because we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1136.159" dur="3.541">probably hit the collapse way before we</text>
  <text start="1138.47" dur="3">start getting a lot of these people off</text>
  <text start="1139.7" dur="3.33">the system because I don&amp;#39;t blink I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1141.47" dur="3.66">think this budget is going to pass I</text>
  <text start="1143.03" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ll let it pass but we</text>
  <text start="1145.13" dur="4.02">can see this is what is being pushed out</text>
  <text start="1147.35" dur="3.27">there and this is the way you would have</text>
  <text start="1149.15" dur="3.57">to do it and approach it to have some</text>
  <text start="1150.62" dur="3.51">type of soft landing but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1152.72" dur="3">we&amp;#39;re going to have a soft landing I</text>
  <text start="1154.13" dur="3.57">think we&amp;#39;re going to have a hard landing</text>
  <text start="1155.72" dur="4.23">and this is why you need to be ready and</text>
  <text start="1157.7" dur="5.19">prepared for when this hits because when</text>
  <text start="1159.95" dur="4.8">it hits it&amp;#39;s going to be devastating</text>
  <text start="1162.89" dur="4.47">because the value of the dollar is going</text>
  <text start="1164.75" dur="5.309">to decrease quite a bit we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1167.36" dur="5.67">see empty food shelves credits going to</text>
  <text start="1170.059" dur="5.011">freeze up and guess what you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1173.03" dur="3.45">have to fend for yourself you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1175.07" dur="5.28">have to find food for yourself the</text>
  <text start="1176.48" dur="6.63">government will not help because we will</text>
  <text start="1180.35" dur="5.73">lose all trade with other countries</text>
  <text start="1183.11" dur="6.27">because the way trade works now is that</text>
  <text start="1186.08" dur="4.86">we give dollars to these countries</text>
  <text start="1189.38" dur="4.19">because they keep it in reserve to pay</text>
  <text start="1190.94" dur="5.43">for the oil and they send back products</text>
  <text start="1193.57" dur="5.71">well the dollar is no longer the reserve</text>
  <text start="1196.37" dur="6.15">currency they&amp;#39;re not sending anything</text>
  <text start="1199.28" dur="6.629">here this is why Trump continually says</text>
  <text start="1202.52" dur="6.21">trade is so important right now because</text>
  <text start="1205.909" dur="4.951">he realizes that the dollar will not</text>
  <text start="1208.73" dur="4.59">exist the way it is right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1210.86" dur="3.24">going to need trade with other countries</text>
  <text start="1213.32" dur="4.859">where we&amp;#39;re going to have to produce</text>
  <text start="1214.1" dur="6.3">something to trade with them and we can</text>
  <text start="1218.179" dur="5.25">see right now that this is something</text>
  <text start="1220.4" dur="4.8">that is going to be needed so don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1223.429" dur="3.781">depend on getting the cheap clothing the</text>
  <text start="1225.2" dur="4.349">cheap products from China don&amp;#39;t depend</text>
  <text start="1227.21" dur="4.02">on getting different food products from</text>

  <text start="1231.23" dur="4.11">other places that&amp;#39;s all going to come to</text>
  <text start="1233.36" dur="4.92">an end for a little while just like when</text>
  <text start="1235.34" dur="7.02">we came on the system back in the 70s</text>
  <text start="1238.28" dur="6.36">how hard it was to get fuel that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1242.36" dur="4.77">we had their green flags the red flags</text>
  <text start="1244.64" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s why we had the odd and even</text>
  <text start="1247.13" dur="4.31">license plates because the system was</text>
  <text start="1250.28" dur="3.899">just coming online</text>
  <text start="1251.44" dur="5.319">it came off the gold standard where</text>
