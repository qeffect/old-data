  <text start="148.25" dur="6.78">breaking down and it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="151.52" dur="6.12">that the mainstream media the financial</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="4.05">pundits are all out there saying and</text>
  <text start="157.64" dur="3.05">they&amp;#39;re putting out articles and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="159.08" dur="4.23">saying that you know more Americans</text>
  <text start="160.69" dur="5.68">they&amp;#39;re getting priced out of purchasing</text>

  <text start="166.37" dur="5.25">prices are increasing well we have the</text>

  <text start="176.81" dur="5.73">I&amp;#39;m talking about the Box canned stuff</text>
  <text start="178.75" dur="8.44">talking about colleges and the question</text>
  <text start="182.54" dur="7.86">is why is this is this because those</text>
  <text start="187.19" dur="5">products are going up in price now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.4" dur="6.33">because the central bank system is</text>
  <text start="192.19" dur="7.87">flawed the flaw is is that as they</text>
  <text start="196.73" dur="8.49">create more and more paper the system</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="7.47">declines it loses value every Federal</text>
  <text start="205.22" dur="4.86">Reserve note that note that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="207.53" dur="7.83">holding is continually losing value</text>
  <text start="210.08" dur="7.95">every single day and people in this</text>
  <text start="215.36" dur="5.1">country and around the world it makes it</text>
  <text start="218.03" dur="6.27">very difficult to afford something this</text>
  <text start="220.46" dur="7.2">is why you see payments now there was</text>
  <text start="224.3" dur="4.74">never anything like this before where if</text>
  <text start="227.66" dur="4.08">you want to go purchase something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="229.04" dur="4.68">50 bucks or 20 bucks you can have a</text>
  <text start="231.74" dur="3.42">payment plan we only can pay where you</text>
  <text start="233.72" dur="2.82">can pay like two dollars a month or</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="4.14">three dollars a month or four dollars a</text>
  <text start="236.54" dur="6.33">month until you pay it off there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="239.3" dur="4.38">reason for this it&amp;#39;s a system that is</text>
  <text start="242.87" dur="4.29">breaking down</text>
  <text start="243.68" dur="5.82">that&amp;#39;s imploding on itself and when you</text>
  <text start="247.16" dur="6.69">look at the housing market yes there are</text>
  <text start="249.5" dur="6.69">bubbles it&amp;#39;s the same exact thing people</text>
  <text start="253.85" dur="6.09">their wages through a central bank</text>
  <text start="256.19" dur="7.77">system it cannot keep up with the</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="6.78">decline of the Federal Reserve Note it</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="5.43">just can&amp;#39;t and what happens over time is</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="5.4">it pushes people out of the market now</text>
  <text start="269.39" dur="7.41">you can understand why Trump wants the</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="7.77">interest rates lowered not to 2% not to</text>
  <text start="276.8" dur="6.45">1% most likely zero and</text>
  <text start="279.89" dur="4.98">what does it do the central bank well it</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="4.01">destroys their system their system is</text>
  <text start="284.87" dur="6.45">based on interest when they loan out</text>
  <text start="287.26" dur="8.37">currency interest is attached it puts</text>
  <text start="291.32" dur="7.2">those government&amp;#39;s the people into debt</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="5.89">Trump the Patriots they understand this</text>
  <text start="298.52" dur="4.59">they understand that if they lower the</text>
  <text start="301.52" dur="4.52">interest rates and continually lower the</text>
  <text start="303.11" dur="6.83">interest rates the central banks suffer</text>
  <text start="306.04" dur="6.28">yes I know those people who have their</text>
  <text start="309.94" dur="5.44">federally note Federal Reserve notes in</text>
  <text start="312.32" dur="5.7">the banks you&amp;#39;re not gaining any</text>
  <text start="315.38" dur="4.95">interest on that actually you&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="318.02" dur="5.88">money on that but remember this is a</text>
  <text start="320.33" dur="5.94">central bank system you can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="323.9" dur="5.07">everything the only thing you can do</text>
  <text start="326.27" dur="6.21">with a central bank system is use it to</text>
  <text start="328.97" dur="7.32">destroy it and start a people system by</text>
  <text start="332.48" dur="5.91">creating a new economic system he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.29" dur="5.01">lowering the interest rates right now to</text>
  <text start="338.39" dur="4.59">keep this system going it brings more</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="3.3">and more people into the housing market</text>
  <text start="342.98" dur="3.51">if the interest rates stayed where they</text>
  <text start="344.6" dur="4.2">were people wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to afford</text>
  <text start="346.49" dur="5.46">anything think about what the central</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="6.23">banks have done they&amp;#39;ve made wealth</text>
  <text start="351.95" dur="6.21">inequality what has Trump been doing</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="5.62">wages in the middle and lower end of the</text>
  <text start="358.16" dur="5.34">spectrum they have been increasing to</text>
  <text start="360.65" dur="6.63">narrow the gap this is being done on</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="6.54">purpose and we also see the trade</text>
  <text start="367.28" dur="6.48">deficit it has shrunk to the smallest</text>
  <text start="370.04" dur="5.04">since Trump was elected the sixty three</text>
  <text start="373.76" dur="3.45">point two million deficit was</text>
  <text start="375.08" dur="4.13">considerably smaller than the sixty</text>
  <text start="377.21" dur="5.15">eight point seven billion expected</text>
  <text start="379.21" dur="7.24">imports fell by 1.3 percent in November</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="7.48">exports rose to 0.7 percent auto exports</text>
  <text start="386.45" dur="5.01">rose to 3.4 percent and if the</text>
  <text start="389.84" dur="4.71">relationship with manufacturing PMI</text>
  <text start="391.46" dur="6.51">holds up the deficit is set to shrink</text>
  <text start="394.55" dur="4.92">further remember the system that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="397.97" dur="4.59">in was designed by the global is</text>
  <text start="399.47" dur="6.3">designed by the central bank that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="402.56" dur="5.609">this system is right now Trump the</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="5.1">patriot as we&amp;#39;ve been watching this in</text>
  <text start="408.169" dur="4.68">real time they&amp;#39;re developing a new</text>
  <text start="410.87" dur="5.669">system where</text>
  <text start="412.849" dur="6.27">it&amp;#39;s not going to enslave the people the</text>
  <text start="416.539" dur="4.8">people will be able to flourish in this</text>
  <text start="419.119" dur="5.67">system the people will be able to take</text>
  <text start="421.339" dur="6.48">back their economic wealth and we can</text>
  <text start="424.789" dur="5.821">see already with the China trade deal</text>

  <text start="441.02" dur="6.989">is about evening out trade evening out</text>
  <text start="445.3" dur="5.789">what the globalists what the central</text>
  <text start="448.009" dur="6.24">banks have done over the many many years</text>
  <text start="451.089" dur="7.151">this is why when Trump was at the UN in</text>
  <text start="454.249" dur="7.95">September he said that globalism does</text>
  <text start="458.24" dur="8.219">not have a future in this new economic</text>

  <text start="473.449" dur="6.21">pushing they were trying to create a</text>
  <text start="476.959" dur="6.57">system that they completely controlled</text>

  <text start="483.529" dur="9.021">planning where the top individuals</text>
  <text start="488.029" dur="6.63">control trade around the world Trump and</text>
  <text start="492.55" dur="4.209">pretty soon the UK and many other</text>
  <text start="494.659" dur="4.68">countries they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="496.759" dur="5.61">individual bilateral trade trade</text>
  <text start="499.339" dur="6.211">agreements with other countries which</text>
  <text start="502.369" dur="4.92">will allow each country to decide what</text>
  <text start="505.55" dur="5.359">type of trade deal they&amp;#39;re going to make</text>
  <text start="507.289" dur="6.72">that will better the country not a</text>
  <text start="510.909" dur="6.19">non-elected group like the EU or the</text>
  <text start="514.009" dur="4.801">Rothschild banking system this is what</text>
  <text start="517.099" dur="4.56">Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s taking everything</text>
  <text start="518.81" dur="6.44">the globalist did and he&amp;#39;s removing it</text>
  <text start="521.659" dur="5.67">one by one creating these trade deals of</text>
  <text start="525.25" dur="3.67">course China doesn&amp;#39;t want to give</text>
  <text start="527.329" dur="3.421">remember there&amp;#39;s still deep state actors</text>
  <text start="528.92" dur="6.18">central bankers in all of these</text>
  <text start="530.75" dur="6.149">countries pushing their agenda making it</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="5.4">difficult and let&amp;#39;s taken for instance</text>
  <text start="536.899" dur="6.961">the UK the people voted three years ago</text>
  <text start="540.5" dur="5.88">to have a brexit why didn&amp;#39;t their</text>
  <text start="543.86" dur="5.22">government listen</text>
  <text start="546.38" dur="6.75">what they wanted why were they trying to</text>
  <text start="549.08" dur="5.82">get around it by creating this deal that</text>
  <text start="553.13" dur="4.38">didn&amp;#39;t benefit the people but benefited</text>
  <text start="554.9" dur="5.31">the EU because there are central bankers</text>
  <text start="557.51" dur="5.88">deep state individuals in these</text>
  <text start="560.21" dur="5.88">countries still pushing their agenda why</text>
  <text start="563.39" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t they like Boris Johnson why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="566.09" dur="4.59">they like Nigel Faraj they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="568.52" dur="6.33">them because they&amp;#39;re not going to do</text>
  <text start="570.68" dur="8.13">what the non elected central bankers</text>
  <text start="574.85" dur="6.51">want why don&amp;#39;t they like Trump why do</text>
  <text start="578.81" dur="5.55">they continually try to say the economy</text>
  <text start="581.36" dur="6.3">is not doing well why do they try to</text>
  <text start="584.36" dur="8.04">still bash him for what is happening in</text>
  <text start="587.66" dur="8.24">the economy because they don&amp;#39;t like him</text>
  <text start="592.4" dur="7.65">reversing what they had going</text>
  <text start="595.9" dur="7.06">they understand his plan in the end is</text>
  <text start="600.05" dur="6.24">to remove the central bank system is to</text>
  <text start="602.96" dur="4.77">shut all of this down and they know that</text>
  <text start="606.29" dur="3.66">they can&amp;#39;t say anything about the stock</text>
  <text start="607.73" dur="4.89">market they can&amp;#39;t say anything about the</text>
  <text start="609.95" dur="4.92">GDP numbers yes they can try to spin it</text>
  <text start="612.62" dur="4.47">a little bit but if they go too far</text>
  <text start="614.87" dur="5.51">people are gonna start to question it</text>
  <text start="617.09" dur="5.43">well wasn&amp;#39;t this how it was all along</text>
  <text start="620.38" dur="4.84">are you trying to say this is</text>
  <text start="622.52" dur="5.85">manipulated and it&amp;#39;s going this is going</text>
  <text start="625.22" dur="6.48">back in time they don&amp;#39;t want to reach</text>
  <text start="628.37" dur="5.16">that far so they spin it a little bit to</text>
  <text start="631.7" dur="4.89">make it seem like Trump&amp;#39;s economy is not</text>
  <text start="633.53" dur="6.39">that great and yes Trump has taking</text>
  <text start="636.59" dur="7.14">responsibility for the stock market or</text>
  <text start="639.92" dur="9.12">has he because if you look at his past</text>
  <text start="643.73" dur="8.55">tweets he blames the Fed he continually</text>
  <text start="649.04" dur="5.82">blames the Fed that if they don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="652.28" dur="5.01">what I want them to do they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="654.86" dur="5.22">to blame I&amp;#39;m making the stock market</text>
  <text start="657.29" dur="6.42">look fantastic he&amp;#39;s taking</text>
  <text start="660.08" dur="5.42">responsibility for that if the Fed does</text>
  <text start="663.71" dur="5.45">anything</text>
  <text start="665.5" dur="5.7">differently than what Trump wants the</text>
  <text start="669.16" dur="4.89">Fed is then to blame so if the stock</text>
  <text start="671.2" dur="5.04">market comes down it will be because of</text>
  <text start="674.05" dur="4.62">the Fed it&amp;#39;ll be because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="676.24" dur="4.5">follow what Trump wanted when he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="678.67" dur="3.45">saying hey lower interest rates and they</text>
  <text start="680.74" dur="3.09">don&amp;#39;t lower interest rates and they</text>
  <text start="682.12" dur="4.2">raise interest rates and the market</text>
  <text start="683.83" dur="4.74">comes down he&amp;#39;s gonna say because he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="686.32" dur="4.74">very already established this look I</text>
  <text start="688.57" dur="4.56">made the market go up to 28,000 points</text>
  <text start="691.06" dur="5.67">the highest we&amp;#39;ve ever seen and now the</text>
  <text start="693.13" dur="6.66">Fed has reversed course and he&amp;#39;ll say is</text>
  <text start="696.73" dur="6.36">that my fault no I was making it better</text>
  <text start="699.79" dur="5.82">and you saw it it&amp;#39;s the Fed that&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="703.09" dur="5.28">the opposite of what we need and like he</text>
  <text start="705.61" dur="5.88">said in the past the Fed has no clue in</text>
