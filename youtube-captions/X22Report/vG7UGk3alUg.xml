  <text start="114.49" dur="5.97">news now as we can see the Bureau of</text>
  <text start="117.399" dur="4.351">Labor Statistics the Fed and the</text>
  <text start="120.46" dur="3.299">corporate media they&amp;#39;re all out there</text>
  <text start="121.75" dur="4.38">telling us how great the employment</text>
  <text start="123.759" dur="4.681">market is and how everyone has a job and</text>
  <text start="126.13" dur="4.979">they never really they do mention it but</text>
  <text start="128.44" dur="5.22">not that often and they don&amp;#39;t dig deep</text>
  <text start="131.109" dur="7.021">into the numbers to explain why there</text>
  <text start="133.66" dur="7.109">are 95 million three hundred and eighty</text>
  <text start="138.13" dur="5.82">five thousand Americans not in the labor</text>
  <text start="140.769" dur="5.25">force now this is a new record and it</text>
  <text start="143.95" dur="5.25">was reached in the latest set of data</text>
  <text start="146.019" dur="5.611">which was released by the BLS and there</text>
  <text start="149.2" dur="4.2">is a bigger issue to all this now a lot</text>
  <text start="151.63" dur="4.26">of people think well a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="153.4" dur="3.869">retiring and this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="4.17">lot of people out of the labor force</text>
  <text start="157.269" dur="5.19">which is actually not true it feels like</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re going back to retail where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="162.459" dur="2.881">saying that everything is moving to</text>
  <text start="163.63" dur="4.25">online and Amazon is taking the business</text>
  <text start="165.34" dur="5.04">away from all the other businesses and</text>
  <text start="167.88" dur="4.78">online business is only 10 percent of</text>
  <text start="170.38" dur="4.889">total retail the same thing is happening</text>
  <text start="172.66" dur="5.449">with the employment numbers everyone is</text>
  <text start="175.269" dur="6.511">not retiring that number is not all</text>
  <text start="178.109" dur="7.21">retirees that number is made up of</text>
  <text start="181.78" dur="4.32">people who can&amp;#39;t find work who want to</text>
  <text start="185.319" dur="2.671">work</text>
  <text start="186.1" dur="4.5">but are just not counted so the</text>
  <text start="187.99" dur="5.28">government decided since they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="190.6" dur="4.91">been on an interview in four weeks we</text>
  <text start="193.27" dur="5.13">just won&amp;#39;t count them they&amp;#39;ve given up</text>
  <text start="195.51" dur="5.23">but if you are continually sending out</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="5.43">your resume and you&amp;#39;re still trying to</text>
  <text start="200.74" dur="5.45">find that job well you&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="203.83" dur="5.88">counted but you still want a job and</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="6.16">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="209.71" dur="8.28">number of Americans who are not in the</text>
  <text start="212.35" dur="10.11">labor force has increased since 2007 and</text>
  <text start="217.99" dur="7.53">it is increased by a stunning 17 point 8</text>
  <text start="222.46" dur="4.8">million people now this is an incredible</text>
  <text start="225.52" dur="3.18">number and most of this increase</text>
  <text start="227.26" dur="5.01">occurred during a time that we were</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="5.46">supposed to be in a recovery now think</text>
  <text start="232.27" dur="3.78">about this for a second they were</text>
  <text start="234.16" dur="5.7">telling us that we were recovering from</text>
  <text start="236.05" dur="5.91">2008 I mean going from 2009-10 2010-11</text>
  <text start="239.86" dur="6.03">twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen and</text>
  <text start="241.96" dur="7.95">seventeen point eight million dropped</text>
  <text start="245.89" dur="6.3">out of the labor force and this makes no</text>
  <text start="249.91" dur="3.9">sense whatsoever now this data coincides</text>
  <text start="252.19" dur="3.81">with the reality that many Americans are</text>
  <text start="253.81" dur="6.87">too broke to afford a home to purchase</text>
  <text start="256" dur="8.28">think about that now let&amp;#39;s start putting</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="5.43">all this together people who are working</text>
  <text start="264.28" dur="3.87">today they might have a part-time job</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re considered a full-time employee</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="4.83">if they have two part-time that&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="270.79" dur="3.9">full-time jobs if they haven&amp;#39;t been on</text>
  <text start="272.98" dur="4.95">an interview within four weeks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="6.18">just not counted you see how this is</text>
  <text start="277.93" dur="5.1">working if they lose that part-time job</text>
  <text start="280.87" dur="3.54">and it&amp;#39;s depending on how many hours</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re working and how much they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.41" dur="5.49">getting paid per week they might not</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="5.84">even be counted as losing a job but they</text>
  <text start="289.9" dur="5.97">were counted as getting a full-time job</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="5.11">when they got the part-time job so you</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="5.49">can see how they can manipulate all this</text>
  <text start="297.55" dur="6.51">now we take all of this and then we move</text>
  <text start="301.36" dur="5.07">it towards towards the retail industry</text>
  <text start="304.06" dur="5.01">now they were trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="306.43" dur="5.85">retail was suffering because of online</text>
  <text start="309.07" dur="4.98">business now yes online business is</text>
  <text start="312.28" dur="4.32">growing it has been growing for quite a</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="5.54">while because we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="316.6" dur="4.79">more and more people are going online</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re not doing dial ups anymore they</text>
  <text start="321.39" dur="6.33">have direct connections people are using</text>
  <text start="322.92" dur="6.6">their smartphones to buy items but again</text>
  <text start="327.72" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s very small at this point it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="329.52" dur="4.5">10% of the entire retail industry and</text>
  <text start="332.31" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="5.79">stores that have an online presence</text>
  <text start="336.21" dur="5.94">still not making it which again makes no</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="4.23">sense whatsoever and if we look very</text>
  <text start="342.15" dur="6.15">closely at this we can see you know like</text>
  <text start="344.04" dur="6.54">Kmart Sears JCPenney the limited they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.3" dur="5.76">all having problems now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="6.72">interesting is the toymaker Mattel they</text>
  <text start="354.06" dur="5.97">are reeling from the poor retail</text>
  <text start="357.3" dur="8.82">environment now if everything is moving</text>
  <text start="360.03" dur="9.24">to online why would Mattel be hurting so</text>
  <text start="366.12" dur="5.66">badly now we know Toys R Us is not doing</text>
  <text start="369.27" dur="5.61">well again they have an online presence</text>
  <text start="371.78" dur="5.05">the reason why these manufacturers who</text>
  <text start="374.88" dur="4.95">are creating the products the reason why</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re hurting is because people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="379.83" dur="4.77">purchasing the way they used to because</text>
  <text start="382.5" dur="4.02">they don&amp;#39;t have the jobs because the</text>
  <text start="384.6" dur="5.55">unemployment rate no matter what number</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="5.79">they tell us is not that number the</text>
  <text start="390.15" dur="5.28">whole thing has been manipulated to</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="4.26">convince us that the economy is doing a</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="4.08">lot better than it really is and if you</text>
  <text start="396.57" dur="5.46">really look the economy has declined</text>
  <text start="399.51" dur="5.1">even further and no one&amp;#39;s even really</text>
  <text start="402.03" dur="5.67">noticing this the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="404.61" dur="5.25">completely staying away from it and when</text>
  <text start="407.7" dur="5.37">we look at Mattel and we&amp;#39;ll use Mattel</text>
  <text start="409.86" dur="6.39">as an example we see dolls</text>
  <text start="413.07" dur="5.31">guess what worldwide they are down in</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="4.91">sales Barbies they&amp;#39;re down by 7 percent</text>
  <text start="418.38" dur="6.9">American Girl dolls were down 30%</text>
  <text start="421.16" dur="6.43">monster high poly pocket were down 42%</text>
  <text start="425.28" dur="4.65">and it&amp;#39;s not just Mattel there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="427.59" dur="4.44">other toy manufacturers that are not</text>
  <text start="429.93" dur="4.14">doing well actually a lot of money</text>
  <text start="432.03" dur="4.47">manufacturers that are creating clothing</text>
  <text start="434.07" dur="5.16">creating other products they are not</text>
  <text start="436.5" dur="5.28">doing well and this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="439.23" dur="4.62">with you know everything moving from</text>
  <text start="441.78" dur="4.08">brick-and-mortar to online this has to</text>
  <text start="443.85" dur="4.8">do with people not going out and</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="4.71">purchasing goods and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="448.65" dur="4.97">is there&amp;#39;s going to be other retailers</text>
  <text start="450.57" dur="7.44">that are on the verge of having</text>
  <text start="453.62" dur="7.3">Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond they&amp;#39;re moving into</text>
  <text start="458.01" dur="4.53">that realm where they&amp;#39;re slated to have</text>
  <text start="460.92" dur="2.97">problems now a lot of people thought</text>
  <text start="462.54" dur="3.12">when linens and things went out of</text>
  <text start="463.89" dur="2.88">business that Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond would</text>
  <text start="465.66" dur="2.94">just take up all the slack and they</text>
  <text start="466.77" dur="3.9">would get all the sales but this again</text>
  <text start="468.6" dur="3.99">is not happening people are just not</text>
  <text start="470.67" dur="3.81">purchasing the way they used to because</text>
  <text start="472.59" dur="4.19">they don&amp;#39;t have the jobs this is why</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="5.85">when we see the labor participation rate</text>
  <text start="476.78" dur="5.22">move to ninety five million three</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="5.04">hundred eighty five thousand people</text>
  <text start="482" dur="7">those people aren&amp;#39;t ninety five million</text>
  <text start="485.37" dur="5.52">and we&amp;#39;re just using the BLS number this</text>
  <text start="489" dur="4.11">numbers actually higher than that but</text>
  <text start="490.89" dur="5.43">let&amp;#39;s just use this number they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="493.11" dur="6.87">going out and purchasing items those</text>
  <text start="496.32" dur="6.21">people who retired who are battling with</text>
  <text start="499.98" dur="4.95">inflation and those people who have</text>
  <text start="502.53" dur="4.5">their pensions and they&amp;#39;re very worried</text>
  <text start="504.93" dur="3.6">about their pensions right now this is</text>
  <text start="507.03" dur="3.42">going to be a huge problem because if</text>
  <text start="508.53" dur="4.23">you look the older generation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.45" dur="4.74">getting part-time jobs because they are</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="5.16">seeing inflation automobile insurance is</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="6.96">going up well they feel that health</text>
  <text start="517.92" dur="7.13">costs are going up food is going up the</text>
  <text start="522.15" dur="5.25">cost of automobiles are going up and</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="7.48">when you look you can see that all these</text>
  <text start="527.4" dur="6.48">things well they take a gouge out of the</text>
  <text start="532.53" dur="3.26">money they&amp;#39;re receiving remember a lot</text>
  <text start="533.88" dur="5.28">of these people aren&amp;#39;t fixed incomes and</text>
  <text start="535.79" dur="5.5">if inflation is hitting they have to get</text>
  <text start="539.16" dur="4.65">another job to make up the difference</text>
  <text start="541.29" dur="7.59">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing and if you</text>
  <text start="543.81" dur="7.95">look the economy since 2008 might have</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="5.22">improved a little bit with a lot of</text>
  <text start="551.76" dur="5.37">manipulation to make us think that that</text>
  <text start="554.1" dur="4.98">it improved but over the long haul here</text>
  <text start="557.13" dur="4.92">we found out that it was just one</text>
  <text start="559.08" dur="5.7">gigantic illusion and now it&amp;#39;s declining</text>
  <text start="562.05" dur="4.92">very rapidly it&amp;#39;s accelerating and we</text>
  <text start="564.78" dur="4.17">track this and a lot of people said no</text>
  <text start="566.97" dur="3.72">retail seems like it&amp;#39;s still good doing</text>
  <text start="568.95" dur="3.39">well to go into online housing still</text>
  <text start="570.69" dur="3.72">doing well but now you can see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="572.34" dur="4.35">coming down on the other side of the</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="4.46">bubbles where we&amp;#39;ve been pumped up all</text>
  <text start="576.69" dur="4.53">the way to 2014 I think it started in</text>
  <text start="578.87" dur="4.03">2015-2016 it got worse we&amp;#39;re at the top</text>
  <text start="581.22" dur="3.45">it was starting to come down here we are</text>
  <text start="582.9" dur="4.05">in 2017 is starting to come down even</text>
  <text start="584.67" dur="4.47">further 2018 is going to get worse</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="5.82">and you know how a roller coaster works</text>
  <text start="589.14" dur="5.46">slow moving up fast moving down but</text>
  <text start="592.77" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re heading down right now and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="594.6" dur="4.74">going to pick up speed we see Russia</text>
  <text start="596.31" dur="6.3">right now well they&amp;#39;re gobbling up a lot</text>
  <text start="599.34" dur="5.52">of gold they&amp;#39;re dumping a lot of US</text>
  <text start="602.61" dur="4.65">Treasuries and they&amp;#39;re purchasing gold</text>
  <text start="604.86" dur="4.44">in the third quarter of 2017 the Central</text>
  <text start="607.26" dur="4.38">Bank of Russia bought about 63 tons of</text>
  <text start="609.3" dur="5.52">the precious metal bringing its gold</text>
  <text start="611.64" dur="5.79">stockpile to around one thousand seven</text>
  <text start="614.82" dur="5.31">hundred and seventy eight tons as the</text>
  <text start="617.43" dur="4.62">end of September and what they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="620.13" dur="4.8">right now is that they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="622.05" dur="4.71">dumping Treasuries and ramping up their</text>
  <text start="624.93" dur="2.34">gold purchases now if they stay on</text>
  <text start="626.76" dur="4.53">course</text>
  <text start="627.27" dur="6.57">they might even bypass China as the</text>
  <text start="631.29" dur="5.82">world&amp;#39;s fifth biggest holder of bullion</text>
  <text start="633.84" dur="6.33">in early 2018 and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch</text>
  <text start="637.11" dur="5.31">this to see what happens with this</text>
  <text start="640.17" dur="4.53">because we know that China Russia India</text>
  <text start="642.42" dur="4.11">and many other countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="644.7" dur="5.34">continually accumulating a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="646.53" dur="5.55">and the reason for this is because they</text>
  <text start="650.04" dur="5.16">understand that this is going to ensure</text>
  <text start="652.08" dur="5.79">the country&amp;#39;s wealth they realize they</text>
  <text start="655.2" dur="6.15">need this gold to back up whatever they</text>
  <text start="657.87" dur="6.12">have their financial economic system</text>
  <text start="661.35" dur="5.01">they need to have this gold in the</text>

  <text start="682.05" dur="4.71">out there especially those who are</text>
  <text start="683.7" dur="4.14">starting up the new system they realize</text>
  <text start="686.76" dur="3.09">when I say they&amp;#39;re starting up the new</text>
  <text start="687.84" dur="4.68">system everything&amp;#39;s moving from the west</text>
  <text start="689.85" dur="3.75">to the east to China and they realized</text>
  <text start="692.52" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;ve been setting this up for a very</text>

  <text start="698.31" dur="4.02">world that they can handle the new</text>

  <text start="702.33" dur="4.26">bankers have done they always transfer</text>
  <text start="704.64" dur="3.48">the wealth to where it needs to go they</text>
  <text start="706.59" dur="3.54">always transfer the manufacturing where</text>
  <text start="708.12" dur="3.72">it needs to go when they start a new</text>
  <text start="710.13" dur="4.86">system when they see their system dying</text>
  <text start="711.84" dur="6.48">because their systems are created to</text>
  <text start="714.99" dur="5.49">fail after 40 to 45 years and this is</text>
  <text start="718.32" dur="2.52">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="720.48" dur="1.86">Tran</text>
  <text start="720.84" dur="3.78">heard everything from the west of the</text>
  <text start="722.34" dur="5.49">East they understood that this was going</text>
  <text start="724.62" dur="5.37">to be needed to be done and this is why</text>
  <text start="727.83" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ve done this over the many many</text>
  <text start="729.99" dur="4.74">years and I remember going back to the</text>
  <text start="732.12" dur="3.99">80s the early 90s when they said</text>
  <text start="734.73" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;ll be no more middle class people</text>
  <text start="736.11" dur="3.3">were laughing and here we are today</text>
  <text start="738.03" dur="3.66">where you see the middle class</text>
  <text start="739.41" dur="3.93">completely gone they also talked about</text>
  <text start="741.69" dur="3.33">manufacturing how it was leaving the</text>
  <text start="743.34" dur="3.62">leaving America people were laughing</text>
  <text start="745.02" dur="4.35">like oh no I&amp;#39;ll never leave America and</text>
  <text start="746.96" dur="4.24">slowly but surely every single company</text>
  <text start="749.37" dur="4.5">was leaving America and they were</text>
  <text start="751.2" dur="5.19">setting up shop across the ocean this</text>
  <text start="753.87" dur="4.14">was in preparation for the system coming</text>
  <text start="756.39" dur="3.48">down they knew it was going to</text>
  <text start="758.01" dur="3.15">eventually come down they knew they were</text>
  <text start="759.87" dur="3.54">going to have to set up a whole new</text>
  <text start="761.16" dur="4.56">system and this is what central bankers</text>
  <text start="763.41" dur="4.41">do they move their entire system</text>
  <text start="765.72" dur="3.42">someplace else they don&amp;#39;t care what</text>
  <text start="767.82" dur="4.17">country they have no allegiance to</text>
  <text start="769.14" dur="5.46">people or to countries and they set it</text>
  <text start="771.99" dur="5.25">up and they do this very slowly they</text>
  <text start="774.6" dur="4.59">they make everyone think that you know</text>
  <text start="777.24" dur="4.26">this is happening because of this reason</text>
  <text start="779.19" dur="4.86">or the other their real reason is</text>
  <text start="781.5" dur="4.62">because their system only lasts for</text>
  <text start="784.05" dur="3.63">about 40 to 45 years and they know</text>
  <text start="786.12" dur="3.15">eventually they have to set up shop</text>
  <text start="787.68" dur="2.67">someplace else and this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
