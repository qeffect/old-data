  <text start="77.15" dur="6.25">legislation at different governments and</text>
  <text start="80.49" dur="5.67">we can see the people are fighting back</text>
  <text start="83.4" dur="4.92">and the people are saying absolutely not</text>
  <text start="86.16" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re not going for this governments are</text>
  <text start="88.32" dur="5.189">actually looking at this saying no this</text>
  <text start="90.66" dur="7.319">does not benefit our country and we see</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="6.841">the TTIP the TPP seta they&amp;#39;re all having</text>
  <text start="97.979" dur="5.611">problems and right now we understand</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="5.64">because we spoke about it the Canadian</text>
  <text start="103.59" dur="4.02">team walked out of the meeting because</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="4.56">it looked like they were going nowhere</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="4.86">with seta so right now we see there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="110.55" dur="6.019">emergency meetings that are being held</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="7.19">in Brussels to try and pull this deal</text>
  <text start="116.569" dur="5.89">back from the brink of collapse and</text>
  <text start="119.66" dur="5.98">Canada&amp;#39;s trade minister says it is up to</text>
  <text start="122.459" dur="5.671">the EU to save set the deal it is being</text>
  <text start="125.64" dur="5.399">blocked by the opposition from Belgium</text>
  <text start="128.13" dur="6.18">and we&amp;#39;re continually seeing many many</text>
  <text start="131.039" dur="5.071">protests around the world saying this is</text>
  <text start="134.31" dur="4.05">not good for the people and it really</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="4.739">isn&amp;#39;t and we can see that the elite the</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="5.82">central bankers they really are trying</text>
  <text start="140.849" dur="5.941">to push this deal on the people as hard</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="4.98">as they possibly can we know the TTIP is</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="5.85">quite dead right now unless something</text>
  <text start="149.16" dur="6.02">happens seta is the back-up plan and it</text>
  <text start="152.64" dur="6.9">is going nowhere whatsoever out in Syria</text>
  <text start="155.18" dur="7.69">we see that during the humanitarian aid</text>
  <text start="159.54" dur="6.18">the ceasefire which is now over we see</text>
  <text start="162.87" dur="5.9">the Syrian rebels well they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="5.76">letting the civilians leave the area</text>
  <text start="168.77" dur="6.16">they were shelling the humanitarian</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="7.08">corridors they were picking off</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="5.08">individuals with sniper fire and we can</text>
  <text start="178.56" dur="5.459">see al-nusrah</text>
  <text start="180.01" dur="7.11">and al-sham the rebranded al-qaeda team</text>
  <text start="184.019" dur="4.481">which the United States did so the UN</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="2.699">wouldn&amp;#39;t recognize them as terrorists</text>
  <text start="188.5" dur="2.489">but it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter you can</text>
  <text start="189.819" dur="3.181">call them whatever you want it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="190.989" dur="4.11">part of the same group and this is why</text>
  <text start="193" dur="3.989">they continually change their names we</text>
  <text start="195.099" dur="3.651">can see they were preventing the</text>
  <text start="196.989" dur="5.28">international committee of the red cross</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="6.459">from evacuating the wounded in these</text>
  <text start="202.269" dur="4.8">areas and remember all of this is being</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="4.411">done by the United States government</text>
  <text start="207.069" dur="5.31">central bankers these are terrorists</text>
  <text start="209.62" dur="6.32">these are paid mercenaries which the</text>
  <text start="212.379" dur="7.771">coalition forces have hired to remove</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="6.699">Assad and of course every plan they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="220.15" dur="4.89">come up with every propaganda piece that</text>
  <text start="222.639" dur="5.041">they&amp;#39;ve been using has not worked and</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="5.699">they&amp;#39;ve tried many of them and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.68" dur="4.979">going back to the chemical weapons once</text>
  <text start="230.739" dur="3.991">again because they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.659" dur="5.071">leaked information from the UN that yes</text>
  <text start="234.73" dur="5.19">Assad was absolutely responsible for the</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="4.409">chemical weapons attacks but what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="239.92" dur="4.649">seen in the past that it always turns</text>
  <text start="242.139" dur="6.421">out to be the terrorist groups and at</text>
  <text start="244.569" dur="8.911">this point why would Assad turn to</text>
  <text start="248.56" dur="7.649">chemical weapons Syria invited Russia</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="6.09">into their country they&amp;#39;ve been removing</text>
  <text start="256.209" dur="5.821">the Islamic state and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="259.57" dur="4.74">battling these terrorist groups for a</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="4.44">very long time and they have the upper</text>
  <text start="264.31" dur="4.74">hand and of course this report is going</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="4.77">back to last August but we can see right</text>
  <text start="269.05" dur="4.92">now that this has been going on for</text>
  <text start="271.24" dur="7.02">quite a while and it seems that this</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="7.259">report was timed perfectly when the</text>
  <text start="278.26" dur="4.649">United States is at a point where they</text>
  <text start="281.229" dur="4.381">are backed into a corner and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="282.909" dur="5.311">trying to use this propaganda against</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="4.11">the Assad government once again and</text>
  <text start="288.22" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for quite a</text>
  <text start="289.72" dur="4.8">while and they keep changing their</text>
  <text start="292.15" dur="4.769">stories if you really look at this you</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="5.94">know Assad uses chemical weapons Assad</text>
  <text start="296.919" dur="5.581">uses barrel bombs Assad uses all these</text>
  <text start="300.46" dur="3.81">different things to destroy his own</text>
  <text start="302.5" dur="6.5">people but then the people turn around</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="8.01">and they elect Assad as their president</text>
  <text start="309" dur="4.86">we have a new election coming up and the</text>
  <text start="312.28" dur="5.27">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="313.86" dur="5.91">that once this election occurs Assad</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="4.53">again is going to be voted in because he</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="5.579">invited Russia in they removed the</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="6.149">terrorists from their land they almost</text>
  <text start="325.349" dur="5.1">have Aleppo and the United States</text>
  <text start="328.229" dur="4.65">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="330.449" dur="6">whatever they possibly can to gain</text>
  <text start="332.879" dur="6.181">traction here and right now they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="336.449" dur="4.5">get any and this is this is what should</text>
  <text start="339.06" dur="4.139">make everyone start to worry because</text>
  <text start="340.949" dur="4.141">they&amp;#39;re going to go to the next step and</text>
  <text start="343.199" dur="3.9">the question is what is the next step</text>
  <text start="345.09" dur="4.919">well the next step is going to be a</text>
  <text start="347.099" dur="4.951">major event they have nothing left</text>
  <text start="350.009" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re backed into a corner they have</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="6.179">no traction in Syria anymore the</text>
  <text start="354.389" dur="7.65">terrorists are being beaten left and</text>
  <text start="358.229" dur="6.271">right that they have no way of matching</text>
  <text start="362.039" dur="6.321">the forces of Russia and Syria right now</text>
  <text start="364.5" dur="7.02">the only way for the United States to</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="5.799">get back into the game is to have some</text>
  <text start="371.52" dur="5.549">type of an event and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="374.159" dur="4.921">looking at right now now we understand</text>
  <text start="377.069" dur="3.69">that the United States government has</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="5.459">pointed their finger at Russia for</text>
  <text start="380.759" dur="5.611">hacking into the dnc cyber attacking the</text>
  <text start="384.539" dur="4.47">election system and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="386.37" dur="5.31">pointing their fingers but very</text>
  <text start="389.009" dur="8.34">interestingly there was a 26 year old</text>
  <text start="391.68" dur="8.88">entrepreneur and he says well I might</text>
  <text start="397.349" dur="6.38">have some leads of what has happened</text>
  <text start="400.56" dur="6.629">with the DNC and the election systems</text>
  <text start="403.729" dur="6.131">because he rents servers he has a small</text>
  <text start="407.189" dur="4.29">business it&amp;#39;s called king servers and he</text>
  <text start="409.86" dur="3.179">says we have the information if the FBI</text>
  <text start="411.479" dur="4.44">asked were ready to supply the IP</text>
  <text start="413.039" dur="7.921">addresses the logs but nobody has</text>
  <text start="415.919" dur="7.62">contacted us whatsoever and after</text>
  <text start="420.96" dur="4.859">learning that the to renters were using</text>
  <text start="423.539" dur="6.69">the nicknames Robin good and Dick Robin</text>
  <text start="425.819" dur="5.94">and they used his servers they rented</text>
  <text start="430.229" dur="4.261">them out from the billing information he</text>
  <text start="431.759" dur="4.5">looked it up and he said ok I understand</text>
  <text start="434.49" dur="4.709">who these people are they were used to</text>
  <text start="436.259" dur="7.351">hack Arizona and Illinois voting systems</text>
  <text start="439.199" dur="7.171">and he shut down the entire systems now</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="3.67">does he know who these people are no he</text>
  <text start="446.37" dur="2.17">doesn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="447.28" dur="4.92">ohs that this is the names they were</text>
  <text start="448.54" dur="6.69">going under and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="452.2" dur="5.46">that none of the agencies are even</text>
  <text start="455.23" dur="5.13">looking at this and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="457.66" dur="7.17">internal data coming from the Kings</text>
  <text start="460.36" dur="8.94">servers we see that they used about 60</text>
  <text start="464.83" dur="8.75">different IP addresses and it came from</text>
  <text start="469.3" dur="8.67">Finland France Italy Norway Britain and</text>
  <text start="473.58" dur="6.01">Sweden and this needs to be looked into</text>
  <text start="477.97" dur="3.96">and we know what the US government</text>
  <text start="479.59" dur="4.71">central bankers do they point a finger</text>
  <text start="481.93" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s complete propaganda they have</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="4.53">absolute no proof and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="486.79" dur="3.629">what they do every single time and when</text>
  <text start="488.83" dur="4.29">somebody calls them out on it to show</text>
  <text start="490.419" dur="5.071">the proof to show where you got this</text>
  <text start="493.12" dur="5.75">information they can never produce it</text>
  <text start="495.49" dur="6.09">and again once something happens like</text>
  <text start="498.87" dur="4.51">this and they come up with an answer and</text>
  <text start="501.58" dur="4.46">they know exactly who it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.38" dur="5.94">completely impossible there is no</text>
  <text start="506.04" dur="5.11">investigation you just can&amp;#39;t say oh look</text>
  <text start="509.32" dur="4.29">the state actor did it because they</text>
  <text start="511.15" dur="4.62">bounce it off and they use many many</text>
  <text start="513.61" dur="4.44">different IP addresses where it could be</text>
  <text start="515.77" dur="5.19">coming from any part of the world so it</text>
  <text start="518.05" dur="5.33">is quite difficult to prove and this is</text>
  <text start="520.96" dur="5.76">why you know it&amp;#39;s fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="4.54">right from the start because how do you</text>
  <text start="526.72" dur="4.47">know this without any type of</text>
  <text start="527.92" dur="7.2">investigation you don&amp;#39;t so we just had</text>
  <text start="531.19" dur="7.94">this cyber attack in the East some out</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="6.719">west and security experts are blaming</text>
  <text start="539.13" dur="6.1">botnets made by thousands of hacked</text>
  <text start="541.839" dur="6.211">embedded systems on the Internet now the</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="5.46">attack originated from the IOT devices</text>
  <text start="548.05" dur="5.43">that have been affected by the mirai</text>
  <text start="550.69" dur="4.98">botnet whose source code was dumped</text>
  <text start="553.48" dur="4.41">shortly thereafter revealing it to be</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="5.13">clumsy it&amp;#39;s like not really</text>
  <text start="557.89" dur="7.26">sophisticated and we can see that they</text>
  <text start="560.8" dur="8.19">attacked devices that had weak security</text>
  <text start="565.15" dur="6.78">on them and there were certain computers</text>
  <text start="568.99" dur="4.38">that were hacked into cameras anything</text>
  <text start="571.93" dur="5.49">that was attached to the internet and</text>
  <text start="573.37" dur="6.45">these devices were used to send traffic</text>
  <text start="577.42" dur="3.3">to dine which is a domain service where</text>
  <text start="579.82" dur="3.85">you</text>
  <text start="580.72" dur="6.28">address there is an address is attached</text>
  <text start="583.67" dur="5.19">to a name and it routes the traffic to</text>
  <text start="587" dur="5.34">the proper domain where you go to look</text>
  <text start="588.86" dur="6.99">visit a website and this whole thing was</text>
  <text start="592.34" dur="7.14">brought down using this mirai source</text>
  <text start="595.85" dur="8.99">code and we can see that millions of</text>
  <text start="599.48" dur="8.04">systems they were used in this attack</text>
  <text start="604.84" dur="5.35">now the attack only used about ten</text>
  <text start="607.52" dur="5.76">percent of the half a million mirai</text>
  <text start="610.19" dur="8.24">nodes available and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="613.28" dur="8.58">that any group or any state actor any</text>
  <text start="618.43" dur="8.4">internal government could use this to</text>
  <text start="621.86" dur="6.75">their benefit now there are a couple of</text>
  <text start="626.83" dur="5.32">organizations that are taking</text>
  <text start="628.61" dur="6">responsibility for this and we see the</text>
  <text start="632.15" dur="4.08">first one which is called new world</text>
  <text start="634.61" dur="4.83">hackers they&amp;#39;ve claimed responsibility</text>
  <text start="636.23" dur="6.3">for the attack and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="639.44" dur="5.61">yes we were doing it we were showing how</text>
  <text start="642.53" dur="4.05">powerful we can attack something the</text>
  <text start="645.05" dur="4.2">other one came from a tweet from</text>
  <text start="646.58" dur="5.1">WikiLeaks saying that hey stop the</text>
  <text start="649.25" dur="4.35">attacks they get the point and they were</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="4.14">saying this was in retaliation for what</text>
  <text start="653.6" dur="6.45">happened in Ecuador where they shut down</text>
  <text start="655.82" dur="5.7">the internet for Julian Assange now we</text>
  <text start="660.05" dur="3.78">can see right now the US government of</text>
  <text start="661.52" dur="4.98">course they&amp;#39;re looking into it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="663.83" dur="4.89">looking at what has happened here and I</text>
  <text start="666.5" dur="5.09">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised that they come out</text>
  <text start="668.72" dur="5.28">with some type of announcement this week</text>
  <text start="671.59" dur="4.69">most likely they might say it&amp;#39;s Russia</text>
  <text start="674" dur="3.69">or maybe they&amp;#39;ll fess up and say they</text>
  <text start="676.28" dur="3.39">really don&amp;#39;t know because they need to</text>
  <text start="677.69" dur="5.97">investigate further but we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="679.67" dur="8.96">happens but we see the people around the</text>
  <text start="683.66" dur="8.49">country they&amp;#39;re really not worried about</text>
  <text start="688.63" dur="6.1">global warming they&amp;#39;re worried some what</text>
  <text start="692.15" dur="6.12">about Obamacare they&amp;#39;re worried some</text>
  <text start="694.73" dur="7.05">what about terrorism but the major thing</text>
  <text start="698.27" dur="9.54">that the American people are scared of</text>
  <text start="701.78" dur="8.58">is government corruption sixty percent</text>
  <text start="707.81" dur="6.12">of Americans fear corruption of the</text>
  <text start="710.36" dur="5.58">government above anything else and</text>
  <text start="713.93" dur="5.43">is coming from Chapman University survey</text>
  <text start="715.94" dur="5.16">of american fears so all the propaganda</text>
  <text start="719.36" dur="4.68">that the government has been feeding us</text>
  <text start="721.1" dur="6.75">about terrorism about global warming oh</text>
  <text start="724.04" dur="5.07">gun control the people are looking at</text>
  <text start="727.85" dur="4.859">this thing you know something we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="729.11" dur="6.39">really more scared of the government the</text>
  <text start="732.709" dur="7.261">corruption and what they&amp;#39;re doing than</text>
  <text start="735.5" dur="6.839">anything else and we can see right now</text>

  <text start="810.529" dur="4.651">no way they can be hacked there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="812.9" dur="4.41">that they can be manipulated now</text>
  <text start="815.18" dur="4.26">remember every time you hear US</text>
  <text start="817.31" dur="4.86">government come out and say this it is</text>
  <text start="819.44" dur="4.29">always always the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="822.17" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re saying and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="823.73" dur="4.349">interesting many of you probably have</text>
  <text start="825.98" dur="5.07">been hearing about this where they want</text>
  <text start="828.079" dur="5.851">you to send in your ballots very early</text>
  <text start="831.05" dur="5.55">send them in now don&amp;#39;t wait to go to the</text>
  <text start="833.93" dur="5.34">election booth now everyone&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="836.6" dur="6.09">wondering why would they do this well</text>
  <text start="839.27" dur="5.939">pull dr. Paul Craig Roberts explained</text>
  <text start="842.69" dur="3.9">why they do this and it really does make</text>
  <text start="845.209" dur="4.951">sense because</text>
  <text start="846.59" dur="8.55">you send your election ballot in they</text>
  <text start="850.16" dur="8.76">can get a handle on which direction the</text>
  <text start="855.14" dur="5.46">people are voting in remember when I</text>
  <text start="858.92" dur="4.14">said they don&amp;#39;t look at the corporate</text>
  <text start="860.6" dur="6.21">polls they don&amp;#39;t look at the the media</text>
  <text start="863.06" dur="5.94">polls they look at their own information</text>
  <text start="866.81" dur="3.51">to figure out what the people are</text>
  <text start="869" dur="3.63">actually thinking and more and more</text>
  <text start="870.32" dur="5.91">people that send in the early ballots</text>
  <text start="872.63" dur="5.49">they look at them and remember hacking</text>
  <text start="876.23" dur="5.1">and manipulating the election systems</text>
  <text start="878.12" dur="5.07">comes from the top because the cards</text>
  <text start="881.33" dur="4.5">that they use the system that they use</text>
  <text start="883.19" dur="4.5">is then delivered to each district and</text>
  <text start="885.83" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re already pre-programmed so they</text>
  <text start="887.69" dur="7.68">need to get a handle on what the people</text>
  <text start="892.46" dur="4.89">are thinking and this way they can make</text>
  <text start="895.37" dur="3.6">it look like the elections are very</text>
  <text start="897.35" dur="5.79">close and this is why they want everyone</text>
  <text start="898.97" dur="7.07">to send it in very very early and we</text>
  <text start="903.14" dur="6.83">also see during this time period that</text>
  <text start="906.04" dur="8.23">DHS police military they&amp;#39;re holding</text>
  <text start="909.97" dur="7.87">simulated drills on the power grid right</text>
  <text start="914.27" dur="6.6">now and there are also reports that the</text>
  <text start="917.84" dur="5.7">US military DHS FEMA well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="920.87" dur="6.39">gearing up for a huge officially</text>
  <text start="923.54" dur="7.49">unannounced martial law drill set to</text>
  <text start="927.26" dur="7.08">October thirtieth and running 30 days</text>
  <text start="931.03" dur="5.35">from that point so it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="934.34" dur="3.6">running from October thirtieth during</text>
  <text start="936.38" dur="5.43">the elections and right after the</text>
  <text start="937.94" dur="8.13">elections now we know for a fact that</text>
  <text start="941.81" dur="7.44">FEMA was on the ground a day or so</text>
  <text start="946.07" dur="5.4">before nine eleven every time there is</text>
  <text start="949.25" dur="5.16">an event any time there&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="951.47" dur="5.73">happens we know that they put things</text>
  <text start="954.41" dur="4.41">into place we know there&amp;#39;s a drill we</text>
  <text start="957.2" dur="3.6">know these people are on the ground and</text>
  <text start="958.82" dur="3.21">we understand from across the country</text>
  <text start="960.8" dur="3.87">where we&amp;#39;re getting information from</text>
  <text start="962.03" dur="5.76">others that are we writing into me that</text>
  <text start="964.67" dur="5.22">a lot of the National Guard police</text>
  <text start="967.79" dur="5.16">departments they&amp;#39;re on high alert</text>
  <text start="969.89" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re mobilizing for during the</text>
  <text start="972.95" dur="5.28">election and after the election so when</text>
  <text start="975.32" dur="5.04">we put all of this together we see that</text>
  <text start="978.23" dur="4.74">DHS FIBA</text>
  <text start="980.36" dur="5.729">they have this drill that they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="982.97" dur="5.91">between October thirtieth to November</text>
  <text start="986.089" dur="6.781">30th we understand that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="988.88" dur="6.51">simulating attacks on the power grid we</text>
  <text start="992.87" dur="4.38">just had this latest cyber attack and</text>
  <text start="995.39" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;re just waiting to hear what the US</text>
  <text start="997.25" dur="3.72">government central bankers and the</text>
  <text start="998.45" dur="4.379">agencies have to say about this but we</text>
  <text start="1000.97" dur="6.9">can see everything that we&amp;#39;ve seen so</text>
  <text start="1002.829" dur="7.021">far it doesn&amp;#39;t point to Russia and we</text>
  <text start="1007.87" dur="6.24">understand that most likely this was an</text>
  <text start="1009.85" dur="7.979">inside job people were hired to do this</text>
  <text start="1014.11" dur="7.02">to create this surface type of attack</text>
  <text start="1017.829" dur="5.401">which really doesn&amp;#39;t damage anything yes</text>
  <text start="1021.13" dur="3.39">it stops people from visiting the sites</text>
  <text start="1023.23" dur="4.02">but if there was really going to be a</text>
  <text start="1024.52" dur="5.159">cyber attack from a state actor they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1027.25" dur="6">not going to waste their time on a DDoS</text>
  <text start="1029.679" dur="7.921">attack they&amp;#39;re going to go in after the</text>
  <text start="1033.25" dur="9.319">main system the critical systems so this</text>
  <text start="1037.6" dur="8.64">to me is a set up it&amp;#39;s high level and</text>
  <text start="1042.569" dur="5.321">it&amp;#39;s to create propaganda but we can see</text>
  <text start="1046.24" dur="5.689">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things happening right</text>
  <text start="1047.89" dur="6.69">now at the same time and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1051.929" dur="6.181">different agencies they&amp;#39;re prepared</text>
  <text start="1054.58" dur="5.849">drills are going on so most likely</text>
  <text start="1058.11" dur="5.11">depending on how these elections go</text>
