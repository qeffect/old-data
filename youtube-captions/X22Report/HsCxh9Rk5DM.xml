  <text start="95" dur="5.43">financial news now yesterday we talked</text>
  <text start="98.54" dur="4.38">about how all the housing numbers were</text>
  <text start="100.43" dur="3.6">completely manipulated fabricated of</text>
  <text start="102.92" dur="3.24">course they said there was an error</text>
  <text start="104.03" dur="5.58">which they were continually using</text>
  <text start="106.16" dur="6.15">throughout the last 10 years and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="109.61" dur="5.4">seen that the economy is not doing as</text>
  <text start="112.31" dur="5.61">well as they want everyone to believe</text>
  <text start="115.01" dur="6.11">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that we</text>
  <text start="117.92" dur="6.42">keep reporting on unemployment how the</text>
  <text start="121.12" dur="5.5">government continually tells us that</text>
  <text start="124.34" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re at five percent and all those</text>
  <text start="126.62" dur="3.66">people who are out of the labor force</text>
  <text start="128.3" dur="5.73">thing they they just don&amp;#39;t want a job</text>
  <text start="130.28" dur="6.12">they don&amp;#39;t want to work and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="134.03" dur="5.45">that the BLS the bureau of labor</text>
  <text start="136.4" dur="8.449">statistics actually the same guys who</text>
  <text start="139.48" dur="10.149">were fabricating jobs data back in 2013</text>
  <text start="144.849" dur="9.731">they are the ones who are manipulating</text>
  <text start="149.629" dur="7.021">everything still and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="154.58" dur="7.439">is people are trying to get an</text>
  <text start="156.65" dur="7.26">explanation of why are all these people</text>
  <text start="162.019" dur="4.381">out of the</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="6.06">labour force I mean you&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="5.64">they don&amp;#39;t want a job but why so a few</text>
  <text start="169.97" dur="6.03">months ago being at the Fed try to</text>
  <text start="172.04" dur="6.78">answer this question try to answer why</text>
  <text start="176" dur="6.06">the labor force is plunging and why</text>
  <text start="178.82" dur="4.71">people don&amp;#39;t want a job so let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="182.06" dur="4.29">some of the stats here thirty five</text>
  <text start="183.53" dur="5.94">percent of the u.s. population wasn&amp;#39;t in</text>
  <text start="186.35" dur="7.86">the labor force in 2014 up from thirty</text>
  <text start="189.47" dur="7.41">1.3 percentage % a decade earlier now</text>
  <text start="194.21" dur="5.43">you&amp;#39;re considered out of the workforce</text>
  <text start="196.88" dur="6.36">if you don&amp;#39;t have a job and aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="199.64" dur="5.61">looking for one that&amp;#39;s distinct from the</text>
  <text start="203.24" dur="5.4">official unemployment rate which tracks</text>
  <text start="205.25" dur="7.83">those who are out of work who are</text>
  <text start="208.64" dur="9.18">actively job hunting drilling down into</text>
  <text start="213.08" dur="7.08">the numbers reveals more about the</text>
  <text start="217.82" dur="4.83">shifts and the reason some people forgo</text>
  <text start="220.16" dur="4.74">a paycheck in all age groups for</text>
  <text start="222.65" dur="4.2">instance more people cited retirement as</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="5.46">the reason for being out of the labor</text>
  <text start="226.85" dur="6.87">force and it wasn&amp;#39;t just older people</text>
  <text start="230.36" dur="5.4">which is kind of strange now i can</text>
  <text start="233.72" dur="4.29">understand because the population is</text>
  <text start="235.76" dur="4.8">getting older a lot of people retired</text>
  <text start="238.01" dur="4.35">and they&amp;#39;re at a labor force but that</text>
  <text start="240.56" dur="5.43">wouldn&amp;#39;t account for almost a hundred</text>
  <text start="242.36" dur="6.87">million people now for americans between</text>
  <text start="245.99" dur="5.219">the ages of 20 and 24 the share of those</text>
  <text start="249.23" dur="4.28">sidelined over the past decade because</text>
  <text start="251.209" dur="4.351">they were in school increased</text>
  <text start="253.51" dur="4.36">unsurprisingly during the decade that</text>
  <text start="255.56" dur="6.33">included the Great Recession what&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="257.87" dur="9.96">unusual is that the share of 20 to 24</text>
  <text start="261.89" dur="11.79">year old say they are retired and that</text>
  <text start="267.83" dur="8.22">doubled from 2004 to 2014 now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="273.68" dur="6.03">know about you but I cannot believe</text>
  <text start="276.05" dur="5.88">there&amp;#39;s this that there&amp;#39;s that many 20</text>
  <text start="279.71" dur="4.83">to 24 year olds that are retired yes</text>
  <text start="281.93" dur="7.86">there are a couple that might have made</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="7.8">their millions but to be retired that</text>
  <text start="289.79" dur="4.68">really doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense and we can</text>
  <text start="292.34" dur="5.06">see what is happening at this point</text>
  <text start="294.47" dur="7.039">there they can&amp;#39;t explain what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="5.73">so they&amp;#39;re creating explanations of why</text>
  <text start="301.509" dur="6">all these people are out of the labor</text>
  <text start="303.13" dur="6.81">force and if you look at all these</text>
  <text start="307.509" dur="5.13">numbers you see the there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="309.94" dur="5.43">percentage of the young and you have to</text>
  <text start="312.639" dur="5.28">remember those people ages 20 to 24</text>
  <text start="315.37" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re coming out of college they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="317.919" dur="7.681">find a job they still have student loans</text>
  <text start="319.75" dur="8.82">and they&amp;#39;re out of a job they&amp;#39;re out of</text>
  <text start="325.6" dur="4.2">the labor force now of course they can</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="3.569">put a label on that saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.8" dur="5.46">retired but you can see how all of this</text>
  <text start="332.139" dur="6.541">is being manipulated to make everyone</text>
  <text start="335.26" dur="6.689">believe that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="6.6">and everything is fine but when they try</text>
  <text start="341.949" dur="5.911">to explain it they can&amp;#39;t come up with an</text>
  <text start="345.28" dur="7.08">explanation because it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="10.589">sense we&amp;#39;re seeing that auto sales right</text>
  <text start="352.36" dur="8.96">now plunge to six-month lows this is the</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="6.871">biggest myth since november of 2008 and</text>
  <text start="361.32" dur="8.23">it looks like massive inventory is being</text>
  <text start="365.32" dur="7.409">built up in America the domestic the</text>
  <text start="369.55" dur="9">domestic auto sales is completely down</text>
  <text start="372.729" dur="10.171">and what&amp;#39;s happening right now is that</text>
  <text start="378.55" dur="8.01">foreign countries and those people with</text>
  <text start="382.9" dur="6.72">subprime credit they&amp;#39;re not purchasing</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="5.82">autos at this point and the factories</text>
  <text start="389.62" dur="8.28">are still producing and their channel</text>
  <text start="392.38" dur="9.27">stuffing the dealerships so the car</text>
  <text start="397.9" dur="8.82">sales here in the US have just tumbled</text>
  <text start="401.65" dur="8.509">and we see that manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="406.72" dur="6.689">declining we see the Baltic Dry Index is</text>
  <text start="410.159" dur="5.44">declining we see a lot of other</text>
  <text start="413.409" dur="7.561">indicators that are showing us that we</text>
  <text start="415.599" dur="9.331">are not in any type of recovery there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.97" dur="9.18">no strength in the economy we are</text>
  <text start="424.93" dur="6.33">looking at a total collapse and those</text>
  <text start="430.15" dur="5.72">people who</text>
  <text start="431.26" dur="11.85">plan to buy an auto has also decreased</text>
  <text start="435.87" dur="10.51">back to the level of 2008 so as more and</text>
  <text start="443.11" dur="8.94">more people lose their jobs as more and</text>
  <text start="446.38" dur="7.62">more people go into that pile where they</text>
  <text start="452.05" dur="7.05">don&amp;#39;t want a job and of course they do I</text>
  <text start="454" dur="6.96">mean I can&amp;#39;t think of anyone who&amp;#39;s 20 30</text>
  <text start="459.1" dur="3.27">40 who say you know something I just</text>
  <text start="460.96" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t want to work I don&amp;#39;t want it</text>

  <text start="464.83" dur="3">don&amp;#39;t want to rent I don&amp;#39;t want to go on</text>
  <text start="466.3" dur="4.44">vacation I don&amp;#39;t want to buy food I</text>
  <text start="467.83" dur="6.33">don&amp;#39;t want any of this yes you can go on</text>
  <text start="470.74" dur="6.75">to the government and get subsidies but</text>
  <text start="474.16" dur="5.88">guess what most people want to work most</text>
  <text start="477.49" dur="7.22">people want to make a living most people</text>
  <text start="480.04" dur="4.67">want to do something with their lives</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="6.7">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="487.75" dur="7.83">there&amp;#39;s a perfect storm and it&amp;#39;s forming</text>
  <text start="491.53" dur="6.39">right now we&amp;#39;re seeing that China&amp;#39;s PMI</text>
  <text start="495.58" dur="5.16">data collapse the u.s. is M</text>

  <text start="515.56" dur="6.3">getting worse not better and we can see</text>
  <text start="519.46" dur="6.29">this this is not something that just</text>
  <text start="521.86" dur="7.02">happened this has been happening and</text>
  <text start="525.75" dur="5.71">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on it and of course</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="5.52">people like know the economy is strong</text>
  <text start="531.46" dur="4.74">and look where we are today and have</text>
  <text start="534.4" dur="3.48">everything that we reported on i&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="536.2" dur="4.41">talking about what the government is</text>
  <text start="537.88" dur="5.7">telling us i&amp;#39;m going through everything</text>
  <text start="540.61" dur="5.43">here to show that how the the economy is</text>

  <text start="552.79" dur="5.07">better and eventually they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="555.82" dur="4.2">come out with the retail numbers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="557.86" dur="4.56">going to put a great spin on it to make</text>
  <text start="560.02" dur="4.93">us believe that retail is fantastic</text>
  <text start="562.42" dur="5.68">until you see stores closing in two</text>
  <text start="564.95" dur="5.1">you see many stores out there saying</text>
  <text start="568.1" dur="3.48">okay we cannot keep up we can&amp;#39;t keep</text>
  <text start="570.05" dur="2.7">these other stores open now we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>

  <text start="572.75" dur="4.11">let these people go this is what we saw</text>
  <text start="574.82" dur="6.44">last year the same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="576.86" dur="7.65">happen right now and as time goes on</text>
  <text start="581.26" dur="5.5">throughout this year it&amp;#39;s just going to</text>
  <text start="584.51" dur="4.95">get worse it is not going to get better</text>
  <text start="586.76" dur="4.44">we already have the IMF which normally</text>
  <text start="589.46" dur="3.36">says the economies you know going to be</text>
  <text start="591.2" dur="3.51">growing the global economy is going to</text>
  <text start="592.82" dur="3.18">be growing they&amp;#39;ve already said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="594.71" dur="3.24">going to be slowing a little bit which</text>
  <text start="596" dur="4.68">means it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot more worse</text>
  <text start="597.95" dur="6.42">a lot worse than they&amp;#39;re saying we also</text>
  <text start="600.68" dur="7.95">see the UN right now they are seeing</text>

  <text start="608.63" dur="10.17">to major headwinds which means that the</text>
  <text start="615.08" dur="6.99">entire system right now is collapsing in</text>
  <text start="618.8" dur="6.15">front of our eyes they said the world</text>
  <text start="622.07" dur="5.88">economy stumbled in 2015 with lower</text>
  <text start="624.95" dur="4.74">commodity prices large capital outflows</text>
  <text start="627.95" dur="5.04">and increase financial market volatility</text>
  <text start="629.69" dur="5.28">and this is coming from a report which</text>
  <text start="632.99" dur="5.04">was released in December from the United</text>
  <text start="634.97" dur="6.81">Nations so global growth last year fell</text>
  <text start="638.03" dur="7.83">to 2.4% and they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s going to</text>

  <text start="692.66" dur="6.08">structure implodes on top of it this is</text>
  <text start="695.57" dur="5.03">what we are seeing right now</text>
