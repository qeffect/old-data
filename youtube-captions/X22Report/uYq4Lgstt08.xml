  <text start="269.389" dur="5.731">understand the UK is trying to break</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="3.99">away from eurozone and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="275.12" dur="3.81">that they&amp;#39;re going to be trying to do</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="4.29">this by 2019 and we see already that the</text>
  <text start="278.93" dur="3.48">eurozone they&amp;#39;re trying to make their</text>
  <text start="280.4" dur="4.53">case and there&amp;#39;s a report from the</text>
  <text start="282.41" dur="4.47">auditors at the PwC and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="4.73">predicting that the eurozone growth will</text>

  <text start="296.72" dur="4.98">very interesting about this is all these</text>
  <text start="299.51" dur="4.65">different organizations that love to</text>
  <text start="301.7" dur="4.14">make predictions but they never really</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="4.71">come true now they&amp;#39;re saying that the UK</text>
  <text start="305.84" dur="5.549">growth will reach around 1.4 percent</text>

  <text start="313.49" dur="3.72">now we need to go back in time a little</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="2.13">bit and the reason why there at first</text>
  <text start="317.21" dur="2.13">before I say that</text>
  <text start="318.2" dur="3.05">reason why they&amp;#39;re saying this is</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="321.25" dur="6.16">if you leave the central bank system</text>
  <text start="325.55" dur="3.09">which really the UK is not doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="327.41" dur="3.12">just leaving the eurozone but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.64" dur="5.43">really not leaving the central bank</text>
  <text start="330.53" dur="5.55">system if you leave us you will not do</text>
  <text start="334.07" dur="4.53">as well this is why they never mentioned</text>
  <text start="336.08" dur="5.82">Iceland Iceland their economy is booming</text>
  <text start="338.6" dur="5.49">they put their bankers in jail and the</text>
  <text start="341.9" dur="4.29">eurozone right now they&amp;#39;re struggling</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="4.38">now remember the PWC</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="8.52">they predicted the global economy will</text>
  <text start="348.47" dur="8.79">grow almost 4% and it didn&amp;#39;t now we can</text>
  <text start="354.71" dur="4.74">see right now the IMF does this the Fed</text>
  <text start="357.26" dur="4.56">does this the federal government does</text>
  <text start="359.45" dur="3.36">this they always put up these numbers</text>
  <text start="361.82" dur="2.19">telling us that you know it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="3.51">like three percent three and a half</text>
  <text start="364.01" dur="4.59">percent and then as time goes on it</text>
  <text start="366.32" dur="4.29">always turns out to be 1.8% remember</text>
  <text start="368.6" dur="3.33">these are manipulated numbers to imagine</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="3.12">if you stripped away the manipulation</text>
  <text start="371.93" dur="3.42">what would you have you&amp;#39;d be in the</text>
  <text start="373.73" dur="3.63">negative territory and if you go to John</text>
  <text start="375.35" dur="3.12">Williams shadow stats you can see that</text>
  <text start="377.36" dur="3.99">the GDP numbers for the United States</text>
  <text start="378.47" dur="5.07">are in the negative area now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="381.35" dur="4.29">interesting about this holiday season</text>
  <text start="383.54" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re making it a really big deal to</text>
  <text start="385.64" dur="4.53">let us know that the retail industry is</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="5">doing well and we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="390.17" dur="5.37">same exact signs that we saw back in</text>
  <text start="392.62" dur="4.96">2016 where during the holiday season</text>
  <text start="395.54" dur="5.07">during the best time of the year for</text>
  <text start="397.58" dur="6.24">retailers retailers started to close</text>
  <text start="400.61" dur="4.92">stores or to declare bankruptcy and back</text>
  <text start="403.82" dur="4.17">then I think it was arabistan many other</text>
  <text start="405.53" dur="3.9">stores that were closing up shop and</text>
  <text start="407.99" dur="3.27">right after the holidays then Macy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.43" dur="3.66">came out and the rest came out and said</text>
  <text start="411.26" dur="4.26">yeah we just didn&amp;#39;t do well and</text>
  <text start="413.09" dur="7.14">everything did not move to Amazon Amazon</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="7.83">is only 3% of the entire retail industry</text>
  <text start="420.23" dur="6.48">online sales is 10% maybe you&amp;#39;ll move up</text>
  <text start="423.35" dur="6.9">to 12% but it&amp;#39;s a small little sliver of</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="7.44">the entire retail market now Toys R Us</text>
  <text start="430.25" dur="7.47">it&amp;#39;s considering closing at least 100</text>
  <text start="434.15" dur="6.48">stores or as many as 200 stores during</text>
  <text start="437.72" dur="4.77">the holiday season what are they saying</text>
  <text start="440.63" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re saying there is a sharp</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="6.54">contraction in sales which declined 15%</text>
  <text start="446.27" dur="5.459">this Christmas shopping season</text>
  <text start="449.03" dur="5.609">from a year earlier now</text>
  <text start="451.729" dur="5.22">this is kind of strange because when we</text>
  <text start="454.639" dur="4.8">look at what is happening here the</text>
  <text start="456.949" dur="5.12">unemployment rate has come down to what</text>
  <text start="459.439" dur="5.04">four point one percent GDP is</text>
  <text start="462.069" dur="4.451">continually moving up the stock market</text>
  <text start="464.479" dur="4.34">is skyrocketing the economy&amp;#39;s supposed</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="7.139">to be booming why are these stores</text>
  <text start="468.819" dur="7.72">having trouble it&amp;#39;s not online it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.659" dur="6.06">because the everyday person they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="476.539" dur="6.391">making the same amount of money or they</text>
  <text start="479.719" dur="7.29">don&amp;#39;t have the job wages are declining</text>

  <text start="487.009" dur="5.49">at its max for many many means many</text>
  <text start="488.93" dur="5.37">individuals many people have gone from a</text>
  <text start="492.499" dur="4.051">full-time job to a part-time job many</text>
  <text start="494.3" dur="5.099">people who&amp;#39;ve had a full-time job can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="496.55" dur="5.97">even find work and they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="499.399" dur="6.27">laying off between 11 and 22 percent of</text>
  <text start="502.52" dur="6">the company store base and this is going</text>
  <text start="505.669" dur="4.56">to have an effect on the total economy</text>
  <text start="508.52" dur="3.78">because let me see a lot more people out</text>
  <text start="510.229" dur="4.771">of work once again now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="512.3" dur="8.269">interesting it was we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="515" dur="8.159">similarities between 1999 2007 and 2017</text>

  <text start="699.079" dur="4.351">they&amp;#39;re afraid of is that people are</text>
  <text start="701.149" dur="4.891">gonna take the cash out of the banking</text>
  <text start="703.43" dur="4.8">system now of course what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="706.04" dur="4.229">is they&amp;#39;re creating these new</text>
  <text start="708.23" dur="4.02">definitions for cash and gold and</text>
  <text start="710.269" dur="3.391">everything else to say you know the</text>
  <text start="712.25" dur="3.899">reason we&amp;#39;re doing this is to stop</text>
  <text start="713.66" dur="4.98">criminal activity money laundering or</text>
  <text start="716.149" dur="4.891">terrorist financing this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="718.64" dur="5.22">to convince everyone of that these</text>
  <text start="721.04" dur="7.44">individuals use cash gold and other type</text>
  <text start="723.86" dur="7.11">of assets now the legislation will allow</text>
  <text start="728.48" dur="6.33">authorities to seize assets from those</text>
  <text start="730.97" dur="6.33">without a criminal conviction new rules</text>
  <text start="734.81" dur="6.24">usurp those currently in existence since</text>
  <text start="737.3" dur="4.98">2005 now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is they</text>
  <text start="741.05" dur="3.21">came out with a name and it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="742.28" dur="4.71">European Parliament&amp;#39;s civil liberties</text>
  <text start="744.26" dur="4.98">and Economic Affairs committees now of</text>
  <text start="746.99" dur="4.8">course this has nothing to do with any</text>
  <text start="749.24" dur="5.31">of that and what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="751.79" dur="5">is they&amp;#39;re introducing tougher checks</text>
  <text start="754.55" dur="5.36">and controls on cash entering or leaving</text>
  <text start="756.79" dur="5.05">different regions now currently</text>
  <text start="759.91" dur="4.42">individuals are required to clear</text>
  <text start="761.84" dur="4.8">cross-border cash sums of ten thousand</text>
  <text start="764.33" dur="5.4">euros or more under the first cash</text>
  <text start="766.64" dur="5.97">control regulation from 2005 a new</text>
  <text start="769.73" dur="5.46">decision were repealed the ccr and allow</text>
  <text start="772.61" dur="7.5">authorities to seize cash below that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="775.19" dur="8.37">right below ten thousand euros should</text>
  <text start="780.11" dur="5.37">criminal activity be suspected and what</text>
  <text start="783.56" dur="4.05">does that really mean well if they</text>
  <text start="785.48" dur="5.46">suspect something then they can go ahead</text>
  <text start="787.61" dur="6.18">and do this and we see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="790.94" dur="6.21">doing this on purpose because they want</text>
  <text start="793.79" dur="7.05">to make sure that they control the</text>
  <text start="797.15" dur="6.42">entire situation this is because the</text>
  <text start="800.84" dur="4.62">system is eventually going to come down</text>
  <text start="803.57" dur="3.9">they don&amp;#39;t want bank runs they want all</text>
  <text start="805.46" dur="3.78">the cash to stay in the banks they want</text>
  <text start="807.47" dur="3.9">to make sure and this is why it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="809.24" dur="4.26">difficult to get cash out of the banks</text>
  <text start="811.37" dur="4.23">they want to make sure that everything</text>
  <text start="813.5" dur="4.65">is inside of the banking system so when</text>
  <text start="815.6" dur="4.53">everything comes apart what they can do</text>
  <text start="818.15" dur="4.32">is they can go inside and take those</text>
  <text start="820.13" dur="4.47">funds to prop up the system once again</text>
  <text start="822.47" dur="4.8">this has been their plan for a while and</text>
  <text start="824.6" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re continually using this plan and</text>
  <text start="827.27" dur="5.4">going down this track because they think</text>
  <text start="829.49" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re still in control now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="832.67" dur="5.43">interesting is Saudi Arabia right now we</text>
  <text start="835.4" dur="5.21">understand that their economy is not</text>
  <text start="838.1" dur="5.01">doing well they confiscated a lot of</text>
  <text start="840.61" dur="5.05">currency from very wealthy individuals</text>
  <text start="843.11" dur="5.88">in Saudi Arabia to try to boost the</text>
  <text start="845.66" dur="6.42">economy they spent a lot of money to</text>
  <text start="848.99" dur="5.28">stimulate the growth as the oil prices</text>
  <text start="852.08" dur="5.67">dropped and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="854.27" dur="6.2">is that the Saudi economy is contracting</text>
  <text start="857.75" dur="5.28">and of course what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="860.47" dur="5.17">tell everyone is that they&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="863.03" dur="5.16">the GDP to grow by 2.7 we know this is</text>
  <text start="865.64" dur="4.83">not going to happen we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="868.19" dur="5.61">gonna have a deficit of about 52 billion</text>
  <text start="870.47" dur="4.89">for 2018 and their entire system is</text>
  <text start="873.8" dur="3.57">imploding this is why they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="875.36" dur="4.08">deals with Russia because they realize</text>
  <text start="877.37" dur="4.26">what is happening the dollar is dying</text>
  <text start="879.44" dur="5.28">what they&amp;#39;ve done is not working because</text>
  <text start="881.63" dur="5.91">they listen to the Cabal they try to put</text>
  <text start="884.72" dur="5.97">pressure on Russia didn&amp;#39;t work they try</text>
  <text start="887.54" dur="5.76">to lower the oil prices to do this</text>
  <text start="890.69" dur="4.62">they also lower the oil prices to keep</text>
  <text start="893.3" dur="3.66">the economy running here in the United</text>
  <text start="895.31" dur="4.14">States because lower oil prices means</text>
  <text start="896.96" dur="4.14">the gas prices are lower people have</text>
  <text start="899.45" dur="3.45">more money in their pockets they were</text>
  <text start="901.1" dur="4.83">hoping that people were gonna spend this</text>
  <text start="902.9" dur="5.22">money in retail and it really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="905.93" dur="4.98">work out that way and also for</text>
  <text start="908.12" dur="5.01">deliveries lower oil prices means higher</text>
  <text start="910.91" dur="3.93">profits for companies they lowered their</text>
  <text start="913.13" dur="3.69">prices a little bit on food and other</text>
  <text start="914.84" dur="3.66">deliveries but they pretty much kept it</text>
  <text start="916.82" dur="4.59">up there and it allowed them to make</text>
  <text start="918.5" dur="5.49">more money delivering these products or</text>
  <text start="921.41" dur="5.07">getting treatments into them and we see</text>
  <text start="923.99" dur="6.66">right now this is all being done because</text>
  <text start="926.48" dur="7.56">the system is coming to an end and once</text>
  <text start="930.65" dur="5.1">the system enters the stage where it</text>
  <text start="934.04" dur="3.12">cannot be supported by all this</text>
  <text start="935.75" dur="3.15">manipulation and everything like this</text>
  <text start="937.16" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re gonna see it start to break down</text>
  <text start="938.9" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re starting to see this in certain</text>
  <text start="941.6" dur="4.11">areas like the countries out in the</text>
  <text start="943.79" dur="4.05">Middle East where they&amp;#39;re not dealing</text>
  <text start="945.71" dur="4.38">with the petro dollar and if you go back</text>
  <text start="947.84" dur="4.7">many many reports ago we said that</text>
  <text start="950.09" dur="5.46">eventually this would happen where</text>
  <text start="952.54" dur="4.54">eventually these countries would not use</text>
  <text start="955.55" dur="4.05">the petro dollar and here we are today</text>
  <text start="957.08" dur="5.04">and remember China introduced a petro</text>
  <text start="959.6" dur="4.86">you won and they&amp;#39;ve completed their</text>
  <text start="962.12" dur="4.44">fifth round of you want back oil futures</text>
  <text start="964.46" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re finished with the tests and</text>
  <text start="966.56" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re hoping that you wann priced</text>
  <text start="969.35" dur="5.51">crude futures they&amp;#39;re hoping that this</text>
  <text start="972.35" dur="5.85">is going to go live on Christmas and</text>
  <text start="974.86" dur="5.83">what this means is that countries now</text>
  <text start="978.2" dur="4.68">will be able to use this now the</text>
  <text start="980.69" dur="4.53">contracts enables the countries trading</text>
  <text start="982.88" dur="3.93">partners to pay with gold or toucan</text>
  <text start="985.22" dur="4.799">you want integral without the necessity</text>
  <text start="986.81" dur="5.61">to keep money in Chinese assets or turn</text>
  <text start="990.019" dur="4.531">it into US dollars it has the potential</text>
  <text start="992.42" dur="4.769">to help China push the one for</text>
  <text start="994.55" dur="5.55">internationalization which they want to</text>
  <text start="997.189" dur="5.19">do and this will open them up because</text>
  <text start="1000.1" dur="4.349">remember they&amp;#39;re starting their new</text>
  <text start="1002.379" dur="4.95">trading system the belt and road</text>
  <text start="1004.449" dur="6.87">initiative and we can see that they need</text>
  <text start="1007.329" dur="5.7">the one to be internationalized this is</text>
  <text start="1011.319" dur="4.111">what the central bankers want this is</text>
  <text start="1013.029" dur="5.221">the beginning stages of the new system</text>
  <text start="1015.43" dur="5.19">and we can see the transition is already</text>
  <text start="1018.25" dur="4.529">beginning and the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="1020.62" dur="4.079">Trump was out there and as he has this</text>
  <text start="1022.779" dur="4.68">whole new strategy right now and if you</text>
  <text start="1024.699" dur="6.87">notice the heart of the national</text>
  <text start="1027.459" dur="8.1">security strategy it is about trade the</text>
  <text start="1031.569" dur="5.941">trade policy is at the heart of the new</text>
  <text start="1035.559" dur="4.681">national security strategy and the</text>
  <text start="1037.51" dur="5.76">reason for this is because the United</text>
  <text start="1040.24" dur="8.569">States is going to have to find their</text>
  <text start="1043.27" dur="10.92">place in the new world trading system</text>
  <text start="1048.809" dur="9.431">because as we can see the TPP well Trump</text>
  <text start="1054.19" dur="6.93">got rid of it the petro dollar is no</text>
  <text start="1058.24" dur="5.76">longer going to be used that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1061.12" dur="4.38">be discontinued the dollar is no longer</text>
  <text start="1064" dur="4.98">going to be the reserve currency of the</text>
  <text start="1065.5" dur="6.72">world trade is going to completely</text>
  <text start="1068.98" dur="5.699">change it&amp;#39;s going to move from the</text>
  <text start="1072.22" dur="4.98">United States where the bulk of the</text>
  <text start="1074.679" dur="5.161">trade was happening because people held</text>
  <text start="1077.2" dur="4.729">dollars and it will be out in China</text>
  <text start="1079.84" dur="4.62">remember when they move everything</text>
  <text start="1081.929" dur="4.271">everything moves not just little pieces</text>
  <text start="1084.46" dur="4.89">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been preparing this</text>
  <text start="1086.2" dur="6.03">for a very long time so the United</text>
  <text start="1089.35" dur="6.15">States needs to get on board with the</text>
  <text start="1092.23" dur="5.49">one belt one Road initiative if the</text>
  <text start="1095.5" dur="5.46">United States is not on board and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1097.72" dur="6.75">you know and makes a deal with China or</text>
  <text start="1100.96" dur="6.599">Russia or any other country the United</text>
  <text start="1104.47" dur="5.79">States is going to be screwed and Trump</text>
  <text start="1107.559" dur="5.1">knows this those who are in power know</text>
  <text start="1110.26" dur="5.94">this because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="1112.659" dur="5.461">is everything the entire economic world</text>
  <text start="1116.2" dur="2.58">structure is about to change</text>
  <text start="1118.12" dur="2.88">just</text>
  <text start="1118.78" dur="4.56">get changed when the United States came</text>
  <text start="1121" dur="4.23">off the gold standard and moved on to</text>
  <text start="1123.34" dur="4.88">the petro dollar system and for those</text>
  <text start="1125.23" dur="5.58">people who remember when that happened</text>
  <text start="1128.22" dur="6.25">well a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t have work we</text>
  <text start="1130.81" dur="7.32">saw a huge amount of inflation at that</text>
  <text start="1134.47" dur="6.6">time we saw that we couldn&amp;#39;t get oil so</text>
  <text start="1138.13" dur="5.88">the gas lines were very long things were</text>
  <text start="1141.07" dur="4.35">out of whack and this was coming on to a</text>
  <text start="1144.01" dur="4.38">system that the United States was going</text>
  <text start="1145.42" dur="5.79">to control we&amp;#39;re coming off of that</text>
  <text start="1148.39" dur="4.47">system and the United States is no</text>
  <text start="1151.21" dur="2.88">longer going to control it the United</text>
  <text start="1152.86" dur="4.14">States is not going to have the reserve</text>
  <text start="1154.09" dur="5.37">currency of the world this is why we see</text>
  <text start="1157" dur="5.31">the opposite happening right now coming</text>
  <text start="1159.46" dur="9.72">on to the system inflation everyone got</text>
  <text start="1162.31" dur="10.92">a bump in wages real estate increased we</text>
  <text start="1169.18" dur="6.39">saw people earning money on CDs in the</text>
  <text start="1173.23" dur="4.35">bank because the interest rates were</text>
  <text start="1175.57" dur="4.92">very high because we had inflation</text>
  <text start="1177.58" dur="6.81">because the government was creating</text>
  <text start="1180.49" dur="5.16">currency or getting the currency from</text>
  <text start="1184.39" dur="3.66">the Fed which loaned it to the</text>
  <text start="1185.65" dur="4.53">government and we see that caused</text>
  <text start="1188.05" dur="3.78">inflation because a lot of dollars in</text>
  <text start="1190.18" dur="3.24">circulation which really means the</text>
  <text start="1191.83" dur="4.52">devaluation of the dollar so they</text>
  <text start="1193.42" dur="6.09">counted it with high interest rates and</text>
  <text start="1196.35" dur="6.16">as we were coming on to the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="1199.51" dur="5.43">system we couldn&amp;#39;t get the oil here in</text>
  <text start="1202.51" dur="5.4">the country it wasn&amp;#39;t shortages the</text>
  <text start="1204.94" dur="3.96">system wasn&amp;#39;t online yet and of course</text>
  <text start="1207.91" dur="1.98">the corporate media was that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1208.9" dur="3.69">saying there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="1209.89" dur="4.77">shortages we hopefully we can find oil</text>
  <text start="1212.59" dur="5.31">and this is why Nixon said ok we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1214.66" dur="5.19">going to lower the speed limit from 65</text>
  <text start="1217.9" dur="5.22">miles an hour down to 55 miles an hour</text>
  <text start="1219.85" dur="6.72">and this would save you know of course</text>
  <text start="1223.12" dur="6.84">they used the idea that we were helping</text>
  <text start="1226.57" dur="5.46">the world by saving energy and cutting</text>
  <text start="1229.96" dur="6.11">down on fuel costs and things like that</text>
  <text start="1232.03" dur="7.23">but really what it was was to basically</text>
  <text start="1236.07" dur="5.2">balance out the amount of oil that was</text>
  <text start="1239.26" dur="4.14">coming into the country and make it so</text>
  <text start="1241.27" dur="5.61">that people don&amp;#39;t use as much until the</text>
  <text start="1243.4" dur="6.09">system was completely online and we see</text>
  <text start="1246.88" dur="5.61">that once again we&amp;#39;re on the opposite</text>
  <text start="1249.49" dur="5.43">side of this wages are</text>
  <text start="1252.49" dur="5.85">increasing their declining interest</text>
  <text start="1254.92" dur="6.26">rates are not increasing their declining</text>
  <text start="1258.34" dur="5.16">or already in the negative territory</text>
  <text start="1261.18" dur="4.12">countries are coming off the petro</text>
  <text start="1263.5" dur="3.81">dollar system when they come off the</text>
  <text start="1265.3" dur="4.29">petro dollar system it will be difficult</text>
  <text start="1267.31" dur="4.29">to get oil in this country once again it</text>
  <text start="1269.59" dur="4.08">won&amp;#39;t be because of shortages or</text>
  <text start="1271.6" dur="4.68">anything like that actually coming off</text>
  <text start="1273.67" dur="4.29">of this that the products that are in</text>
  <text start="1276.28" dur="3.18">the stores it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="1277.96" dur="3.72">difficult to get those products to</text>
  <text start="1279.46" dur="3.33">because we&amp;#39;re no longer the reserve</text>
  <text start="1281.68" dur="3.33">currency we&amp;#39;re gonna go through this</text>
  <text start="1282.79" dur="4.56">whole transition phase and it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="1285.01" dur="3.87">begun people don&amp;#39;t even know it yet but</text>
  <text start="1287.35" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;ve been following this we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1288.88" dur="5.49">tracking this and it&amp;#39;s already started</text>
  <text start="1291.1" dur="6.24">and we can see that this has been done a</text>
  <text start="1294.37" dur="5.25">little bit out of time and this is the</text>
  <text start="1297.34" dur="4.71">way the central bank&amp;#39;s work and here we</text>
  <text start="1299.62" dur="4.11">are at the end of the system where</text>
  <text start="1302.05" dur="3.48">people don&amp;#39;t even you know make any</text>
  <text start="1303.73" dur="4.38">money in the banks because the interest</text>
  <text start="1305.53" dur="5.04">rates are so low so we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="1308.11" dur="5.79">see that things are starting to fall</text>
  <text start="1310.57" dur="6.81">apart we&amp;#39;re on the opposite side of the</text>
  <text start="1313.9" dur="4.92">system and you can see how it looks up</text>
