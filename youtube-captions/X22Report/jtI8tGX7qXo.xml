  <text start="116.5" dur="6.42">right now is they&amp;#39;re trying to stop this</text>
  <text start="120.85" dur="4.71">whole thing from happening and it looks</text>
  <text start="122.92" dur="4.44">like the Spanish Court is going to be</text>
  <text start="125.56" dur="4.74">blocking the Catalan Parliament from</text>
  <text start="127.36" dur="5.28">declaring independence and it looks like</text>
  <text start="130.3" dur="7.62">they&amp;#39;re trying to do this now this might</text>
  <text start="132.64" dur="7.47">kick off a civil war and we can see that</text>
  <text start="137.92" dur="4.11">those individuals who want independence</text>
  <text start="140.11" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re gonna get angry we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="142.03" dur="3.69">protests we&amp;#39;re gonna see riots I think</text>
  <text start="144.16" dur="4.65">the Spanish government needs to take a</text>
  <text start="145.72" dur="6.12">step back and reevaluate this or they</text>
  <text start="148.81" dur="5.46">will end up in a civil war and this will</text>
  <text start="151.84" dur="4.89">be a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="154.27" dur="5.25">now something very interesting happened</text>
  <text start="156.73" dur="6.36">with Russia and Saudi Arabia Saudi</text>
  <text start="159.52" dur="6.21">Arabia now is pivoting away from the</text>
  <text start="163.09" dur="4.59">United States and this is official right</text>
  <text start="165.73" dur="4.11">now because Putin met with the king of</text>
  <text start="167.68" dur="5.55">Saudi Arabia this is the first state</text>
  <text start="169.84" dur="6.54">visit to Russia by a reigning Saudi</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="4.8">monarch and they have launched a new</text>
  <text start="176.38" dur="5.52">level of relations between the countries</text>
  <text start="178.03" dur="7.769">and they agreed on billions in new</text>
  <text start="181.9" dur="5.13">energy focused deals the two countries</text>
  <text start="185.799" dur="3.571">launched a joint energy</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="3.84">investment fund worth 1 billion which</text>
  <text start="189.37" dur="4.73">could include investments in natural gas</text>
  <text start="190.87" dur="6.24">projects and petrochemical plants now</text>
  <text start="194.1" dur="6.12">along with this deal they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="197.11" dur="7.22">talking about a Russian direct</text>
  <text start="200.22" dur="8.08">investment fund and gas processing and</text>
  <text start="204.33" dur="6.1">we can see that on top of this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.3" dur="5.97">also looking to purchase the Russian</text>
  <text start="210.43" dur="9.75">s400 surface-to-air missiles so the</text>
  <text start="214.27" dur="9.83">military the gas industry is now working</text>
  <text start="220.18" dur="7.08">with Russia this is the slow pivot away</text>
  <text start="224.1" dur="6.46">from the United States and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="227.26" dur="5.79">many countries do this at this time and</text>
  <text start="230.56" dur="5.459">how much do you wanna bet they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="233.05" dur="4.59">to be dealing outside of the dollar</text>
  <text start="236.019" dur="5.911">they&amp;#39;re going to be either dealing in</text>
  <text start="237.64" dur="7.2">the U 1 or the ruble and it will not</text>
  <text start="241.93" dur="5.07">include the dollar whatsoever and if</text>
  <text start="244.84" dur="4.47">Saudi Arabia does this you can bet</text>
  <text start="247" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s going to be another country that</text>
  <text start="249.31" dur="5.88">does this and so on so far Qatar already</text>
  <text start="251.86" dur="5.43">is dealing with Iran China and Russia we</text>
  <text start="255.19" dur="4.049">can see that other countries are then</text>
  <text start="257.29" dur="5.79">going to join in probably Jordan next</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="6.601">and so on and so forth so this is the</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="5.43">the big pivot and it starts out slow</text>
  <text start="265.84" dur="5.22">starts out small started out them just</text>
  <text start="268.51" dur="6.62">talking and here they are making a deal</text>
  <text start="271.06" dur="9.9">now and we can see that this is being</text>
  <text start="275.13" dur="7.72">pushed China Russia they&amp;#39;re going around</text>
  <text start="280.96" dur="4.53">the world making bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="282.85" dur="4.95">agreements bring everyone into the fold</text>
  <text start="285.49" dur="4.26">into the belton road and the United</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="4.8">States is standing on the outside</text>
  <text start="289.75" dur="4.5">looking in and we can see there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="292.6" dur="5.52">to be a lot more countries right now</text>
  <text start="294.25" dur="6.81">that are looking to deal outside of the</text>
  <text start="298.12" dur="5.28">dollar and as they keep doing this these</text>
  <text start="301.06" dur="6.3">sanctions the power of the dollar is</text>
  <text start="303.4" dur="6.57">going to decrease every single time now</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="5.1">it doesn&amp;#39;t happen overnight this happens</text>
  <text start="309.97" dur="4.02">over a period of time and if we look</text>
  <text start="312.46" dur="3.57">back when we first started reporting on</text>
  <text start="313.99" dur="4.14">this and how China is building up their</text>
  <text start="316.03" dur="4.29">infrastructure building up their markets</text>
  <text start="318.13" dur="2.78">creating a payment system making sure</text>
  <text start="320.32" dur="2.09">that</text>
  <text start="320.91" dur="4.41">they can get the you want included in</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="5.07">the SDR this is all the central bankers</text>
  <text start="325.32" dur="4.11">driving all of this because they know</text>
  <text start="327.48" dur="3.57">that dollar system is dying there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="3.54">too much debt out there there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="3.63">they can do the countries are in too</text>
  <text start="332.97" dur="3.15">much debt even if they put more</text>
  <text start="334.68" dur="3.42">austerity on a lot of these countries</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="3.87">the countries are just going to implode</text>
  <text start="338.1" dur="3.69">on themselves and the only way these</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="6.03">countries can stay afloat right now is</text>
  <text start="341.79" dur="6.45">with more debt and we can see that all</text>
  <text start="346.02" dur="4.26">these countries are having a problem we</text>
  <text start="348.24" dur="4.62">have a huge amount of debt which can</text>
  <text start="350.28" dur="6.21">never be paid back so what they do is</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="5.7">they start creating a new system now</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="3.66">this might include cryptocurrency the</text>
  <text start="358.56" dur="3.93">STRs might be traded amongst the</text>
  <text start="360.15" dur="4.56">countries but what they do is they mimic</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="4.38">everything someplace else they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="364.71" dur="4.02">care what country it is they have no</text>
  <text start="366.87" dur="3.93">allegiance whatsoever to any country</text>
  <text start="368.73" dur="3.9">their allegiance is to themselves as</text>
  <text start="370.8" dur="5.28">long as they have the power of creation</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="6.45">of currency they can control everything</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="4.71">in the world and they know this this is</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="3.51">why we&amp;#39;ve been seeing the slow buildup</text>
  <text start="380.79" dur="5.19">in China because this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="382.59" dur="4.79">choosing they&amp;#39;re choosing this area this</text>
  <text start="385.98" dur="5.1">is why we&amp;#39;ve been seeing the slow</text>
  <text start="387.38" dur="6.73">transfer of countries using the ruble</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="4.98">the yuyuan and not using the dollar so</text>
  <text start="394.11" dur="5.34">things are slowly moving in this</text>
  <text start="396.06" dur="5.49">direction we see that there are new</text>
  <text start="399.45" dur="5.37">rules of engagement for Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="401.55" dur="6.6">troops US troops can now call fire in</text>
  <text start="404.82" dur="5.52">support of Afghan forces and we see that</text>
  <text start="408.15" dur="5.1">things are dramatically changing in this</text>
  <text start="410.34" dur="4.95">area in North Korea everyone is</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="4.8">screaming more everyone saying war is</text>
  <text start="415.29" dur="5.52">coming North Korea is threatening war</text>
  <text start="418.05" dur="4.95">and of course Trump is basically</text>
  <text start="420.81" dur="5.04">retaliating and saying yes you know</text>
  <text start="423" dur="5.22">watch what you&amp;#39;re doing here but what we</text>
  <text start="425.85" dur="4.77">see here is there&amp;#39;s no real clear signs</text>
  <text start="428.22" dur="4.74">that the country is actually preparing</text>
  <text start="430.62" dur="5.1">for a conflict now North Korea</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="4.89">reportedly relocated fighters and some</text>
  <text start="435.72" dur="5.87">anti-aircraft units the country&amp;#39;s East</text>
  <text start="437.85" dur="6.99">Coast but beyond that they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="441.59" dur="6.61">nothing there&amp;#39;s no real evidence the</text>
  <text start="444.84" dur="6.36">country is anticipating a war they have</text>
  <text start="448.2" dur="6.45">a couple of posters up around North</text>
  <text start="451.2" dur="5.67">Korea banners the banners about our</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="5">out defeating America and achieving</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="4.859">final victory but if they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="459.65" dur="6.04">screaming and saying this is an act of</text>
  <text start="461.729" dur="7.261">war they&amp;#39;ve done nothing the only major</text>
  <text start="465.69" dur="6.229">initiative was mobilizing residents to</text>
  <text start="468.99" dur="5.85">participate in mass rallies that is it</text>
  <text start="471.919" dur="7.09">so all this talk about them getting</text>
  <text start="474.84" dur="6.27">ready for war it&amp;#39;s not happening what</text>
  <text start="479.009" dur="3.511">they want to do is they want to develop</text>
  <text start="481.11" dur="3.839">their missile systems they want to</text>
  <text start="482.52" dur="5.429">develop their nuclear technology so the</text>
  <text start="484.949" dur="6.331">United States cannot invade North Korea</text>
  <text start="487.949" dur="4.951">we see that Trump is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.28" dur="5.16">saying that he&amp;#39;s planning to a draw from</text>
  <text start="492.9" dur="6.75">the Iran nuclear deal now Russia is</text>
  <text start="496.44" dur="6.21">saying that these are rumors we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="499.65" dur="7.049">seen any facts as of yet and we have to</text>
  <text start="502.65" dur="9.6">remember why was there a nuclear deal in</text>
  <text start="506.699" dur="7.77">Iran well it made sure that Iran never</text>
  <text start="512.25" dur="4.44">developed a nuclear weapon because we</text>
  <text start="514.469" dur="5.13">have to remember that going back in time</text>
  <text start="516.69" dur="4.92">the plan was to go into all the Middle</text>
  <text start="519.599" dur="3.75">Eastern countries have regime change go</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="5.61">into Syria have regime change and the</text>
  <text start="523.349" dur="6.211">last country was Iran if they developed</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="4.92">a nuclear weapon they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able</text>
  <text start="529.56" dur="4.32">to invade if you look at what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="532.14" dur="3.78">done those countries that don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="533.88" dur="3.959">nuclear weapons those are the countries</text>
  <text start="535.92" dur="4.74">the United States the Cabal have gone</text>
  <text start="537.839" dur="5.041">into and if Iran developed a nuclear</text>
  <text start="540.66" dur="4.65">weapon they would have gone into that</text>
  <text start="542.88" dur="3.959">country so they made this deal that made</text>
  <text start="545.31" dur="4.529">it sound really great oh we&amp;#39;ll give you</text>
  <text start="546.839" dur="5.19">the sanction money as long as you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="549.839" dur="4.051">develop a nuclear weapon on the surface</text>
  <text start="552.029" dur="3.541">it sounds great but their plan</text>
  <text start="553.89" dur="2.819">eventually because the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="555.57" dur="3.18">think about it the Islamic state was</text>
  <text start="556.709" dur="3.691">winning they were gaining ground</text>
  <text start="558.75" dur="3.33">this was the paid mercenaries from the</text>
  <text start="560.4" dur="5.07">United States and they were getting</text>
  <text start="562.08" dur="6.509">ready to go into Damascus I mean they</text>
  <text start="565.47" dur="5.4">were that close of defeating Assad Assad</text>
  <text start="568.589" dur="4.401">was floundering and then he invited</text>
  <text start="570.87" dur="4.52">Russia in and things started to change</text>
  <text start="572.99" dur="5.2">because they made the deal with Iran</text>
  <text start="575.39" dur="5.74">they thought they had Syria the next</text>
  <text start="578.19" dur="4.769">step was Iran and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="581.13" dur="4.02">things are radically changing all the</text>
  <text start="582.959" dur="4.191">plans they had well they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="585.15" dur="3.78">fizzle away and things are starting to</text>
  <text start="587.15" dur="5.249">you know fall</text>
  <text start="588.93" dur="8.04">and Syria right now is controlled by</text>
  <text start="592.399" dur="6.221">Assad and Russia United States there is</text>
  <text start="596.97" dur="3.45">no control anymore the paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="598.62" dur="4.29">the Islamic state they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="600.42" dur="5.97">control but we can see that the site</text>
  <text start="602.91" dur="6.54">intelligence the Islamic state they have</text>
  <text start="606.39" dur="5.93">tripled down on its claim that the las</text>
  <text start="609.45" dur="5.639">vegas shooter steven paddock was both a</text>
  <text start="612.32" dur="4.75">convert to islam and operating on the</text>
  <text start="615.089" dur="4.711">behalf of the Islamic state now we know</text>
  <text start="617.07" dur="4.92">that site intelligence is a Mossad</text>
  <text start="619.8" dur="4.62">operation this is part of their</text>
  <text start="621.99" dur="4.59">intelligence apparatus the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="624.42" dur="5.039">was created by the United States by</text>
  <text start="626.58" dur="5.97">Israel by the coalition forces to be</text>
  <text start="629.459" dur="4.141">used in these areas and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="632.55" dur="3.75">to convince it and there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="633.6" dur="6.75">different agendas going on with this</text>
  <text start="636.3" dur="5.849">shooting and those that are trying to</text>
  <text start="640.35" dur="4.44">push the Islamic state agenda they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="642.149" dur="5.161">pushing very very hard but with all of</text>
  <text start="644.79" dur="4.77">this we always know that the</text>
  <text start="647.31" dur="5.16">intelligence agencies always have their</text>
  <text start="649.56" dur="7.05">hands in this now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="652.47" dur="7.97">right now is that the Las Vegas shooter</text>
  <text start="656.61" dur="7.169">there are many different Iraq</text>
  <text start="660.44" dur="4.72">irregularities in the photo of where he</text>
  <text start="663.779" dur="3.151">shot himself and I mentioned this before</text>
  <text start="665.16" dur="3.51">in another report and this time I put</text>
  <text start="666.93" dur="3.93">the photo on the x-22 report you can</text>
  <text start="668.67" dur="4.89">also see it on YouTube and you see him</text>
  <text start="670.86" dur="6.3">laying there and there&amp;#39;s a weapon there</text>
  <text start="673.56" dur="6.48">which I said was over his foot how did</text>
  <text start="677.16" dur="3.9">this happen and there&amp;#39;s other things in</text>
  <text start="680.04" dur="4.049">the room I mean it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="681.06" dur="4.29">completely staged and when you look at</text>
  <text start="684.089" dur="3.451">this you scratch your head a news item</text>
  <text start="685.35" dur="5.19">this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now the other</text>
  <text start="687.54" dur="5.1">thing is that there are individuals out</text>
  <text start="690.54" dur="5.13">there doing a lot of research and Mike</text>
  <text start="692.64" dur="4.889">Toth is out there saying that you know</text>
  <text start="695.67" dur="5.159">things really don&amp;#39;t make sense here and</text>
  <text start="697.529" dur="6.091">when they look into Steven paddock and</text>
  <text start="700.829" dur="5.421">you look and they look and look into his</text>
  <text start="703.62" dur="5.4">planes and the two planes that he has</text>
  <text start="706.25" dur="5.079">something is very strange about it the</text>
  <text start="709.02" dur="7.86">tail number of one of those planes is n</text>
  <text start="711.329" dur="7.26">5 3 4 3 M a serie a cirrus sr20 you can</text>
  <text start="716.88" dur="2.73">see that this was owned by panic by</text>
  <text start="718.589" dur="2.491">going to the website</text>
  <text start="719.61" dur="3.3">FlightAware calm</text>
  <text start="721.08" dur="4.2">but paddock doesn&amp;#39;t own the plane</text>
  <text start="722.91" dur="4.2">anymore it was grounded three years ago</text>
  <text start="725.28" dur="5.73">and it&amp;#39;s now in the hands of none other</text>
  <text start="727.11" dur="5.58">than Volant LLC and there&amp;#39;s little</text>
  <text start="731.01" dur="4.35">information on this company</text>
  <text start="732.69" dur="4.67">however Voland associates is none other</text>
  <text start="735.36" dur="5.34">than the department of defense</text>
  <text start="737.36" dur="4.51">contractor meaning pad explained has</text>
  <text start="740.7" dur="3.15">been in the hands of the United States</text>
  <text start="741.87" dur="5.76">government for the past three years and</text>
  <text start="743.85" dur="9.24">grounded since which is very interesting</text>
  <text start="747.63" dur="9">now the registration of the cirrus sr20</text>
  <text start="753.09" dur="5.01">is listed as active even though it</text>
  <text start="756.63" dur="3.63">hasn&amp;#39;t been flown in three years now the</text>
  <text start="758.1" dur="4.56">FAA they should have the same</text>
  <text start="760.26" dur="5.22">information but they don&amp;#39;t their website</text>
  <text start="762.66" dur="6.54">shows that a different aircraft a Cessna</text>
  <text start="765.48" dur="6.51">152 maintains that tail number and it</text>
  <text start="769.2" dur="6.48">was last registered to a person in San</text>
  <text start="771.99" dur="5.19">Diego the FAA is a government agency and</text>
  <text start="775.68" dur="5.78">it appears that it is scrubbed the</text>
  <text start="777.18" dur="7.44">planes information why was this done now</text>
  <text start="781.46" dur="4.81">a lot of these a lot of this information</text>
  <text start="784.62" dur="4.02">and everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="786.27" dur="4.62">all really doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and</text>
  <text start="788.64" dur="4.53">there&amp;#39;s a lot of pieces to the puzzle</text>
  <text start="790.89" dur="4.23">that are starting to form showing that</text>
  <text start="793.17" dur="4.29">most likely he might have had</text>
  <text start="795.12" dur="4.65">connections to intelligent the</text>
  <text start="797.46" dur="4.05">intelligence agencies that he might have</text>
  <text start="799.77" dur="4.68">been a patsy that he might have been</text>
  <text start="801.51" dur="4.83">working with them not knowing that this</text>
  <text start="804.45" dur="3.87">was going to go down in this fashion</text>
  <text start="806.34" dur="4.44">this is how they work with these</text>
  <text start="808.32" dur="4.89">individuals now Julian Assange is out</text>
  <text start="810.78" dur="6.63">there and he&amp;#39;s saying that almost all</text>
  <text start="813.21" dur="7.89">terror plots are created by the FBI as</text>
  <text start="817.41" dur="5.28">part of its business model and we have</text>
  <text start="821.1" dur="4.95">to remember he&amp;#39;s part of WikiLeaks he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="822.69" dur="5.88">dumped all the emails he basically finds</text>
  <text start="826.05" dur="5.4">out all this information and puts it out</text>
  <text start="828.57" dur="4.2">into the public arena and of course you</text>
  <text start="831.45" dur="3.93">know the intelligence agencies the</text>
  <text start="832.77" dur="4.08">government&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t like this and we</text>
  <text start="835.38" dur="3.6">know that the intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="836.85" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re behind a lot of this is why they</text>
  <text start="838.98" dur="3.15">show up to the scene very very quickly</text>
  <text start="840.57" dur="4.05">this is why they take control of the</text>
  <text start="842.13" dur="5.58">scene so they can basically control the</text>
  <text start="844.62" dur="6.54">situation as it unravels and they keep</text>
  <text start="847.71" dur="4.98">the local individuals back from what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="851.16" dur="3.83">really happening so they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="852.69" dur="5.17">see what&amp;#39;s happening they they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="854.99" dur="4.89">told what is happening and once again</text>
  <text start="857.86" dur="4.39">when we look at everything that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="859.88" dur="4.459">going on around the country around the</text>
  <text start="862.25" dur="5.01">world there&amp;#39;s a lot of inconsistencies</text>
  <text start="864.339" dur="6.071">with these type of an event with these</text>
  <text start="867.26" dur="5.61">events and many people are pointing it</text>
  <text start="870.41" dur="4.35">out just like people pointing out that</text>
  <text start="872.87" dur="3.3">there were multiple shooters police were</text>
  <text start="874.76" dur="3.36">even saying there were multiple shooters</text>
  <text start="876.17" dur="4.289">multiple shooters on the police scanner</text>
  <text start="878.12" dur="3.87">I mean he goes on and on and on and a</text>
  <text start="880.459" dur="3.481">lot of things don&amp;#39;t make sense remember</text>
  <text start="881.99" dur="4.95">the concert was very loud how did you</text>
  <text start="883.94" dur="6.63">hear the gunfire so clearly as they were</text>
  <text start="886.94" dur="6.48">playing something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and</text>
  <text start="890.57" dur="6.06">again it was a very far distance to have</text>
  <text start="893.42" dur="5.729">the stamina to fire this weapon and to</text>
  <text start="896.63" dur="4.29">actually kill the number of people very</text>
  <text start="899.149" dur="3.451">very difficult but we can see that the</text>
  <text start="900.92" dur="3.6">corporate media is continually going on</text>
  <text start="902.6" dur="4.26">with this story there&amp;#39;s no investigation</text>
  <text start="904.52" dur="5.879">whatsoever and there are people that are</text>
  <text start="906.86" dur="5.4">on the ground who are you know amateur</text>
  <text start="910.399" dur="3.961">investigators they&amp;#39;re looking into all</text>
  <text start="912.26" dur="3.75">these things and questioning all these</text>
  <text start="914.36" dur="3.81">different things and why is this</text>
  <text start="916.01" dur="4.05">happening now once again I believe we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.17" dur="3.84">gonna see another big event I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="920.06" dur="4.29">think this one went the way they thought</text>
  <text start="922.01" dur="4.199">it was going to go and this is why the</text>
  <text start="924.35" dur="4.049">corporate media is trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="926.209" dur="4.111">what is the real agenda here and they</text>
  <text start="928.399" dur="4.68">can&amp;#39;t figure out why this person did</text>
  <text start="930.32" dur="4.68">this I think a lot more was planned but</text>
  <text start="933.079" dur="3.811">things went south very quickly I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="935" dur="4.41">know if people in the hotel figured out</text>
  <text start="936.89" dur="4.86">what was going on and you know things</text>
  <text start="939.41" dur="5.07">got things didn&amp;#39;t work out the way they</text>
  <text start="941.75" dur="4.079">thought so I think the Cabal most likely</text>
  <text start="944.48" dur="3.229">is gonna be planning another event</text>
  <text start="945.829" dur="4.441">because we&amp;#39;re getting to the point where</text>
  <text start="947.709" dur="4.241">they&amp;#39;re losing control of mostly</text>
  <text start="950.27" dur="3.809">everything right now and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="951.95" dur="4.41">trying to continue on with the Russian</text>
  <text start="954.079" dur="4.681">collusion they&amp;#39;re trying to continue on</text>
  <text start="956.36" dur="3.78">with North Korea Syria right now is a</text>
  <text start="958.76" dur="3.389">lost cause unless they do something</text>
  <text start="960.14" dur="3.66">major so I think they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="962.149" dur="4.411">for something big for North Korea</text>
  <text start="963.8" dur="5.849">because if they don&amp;#39;t the EU China</text>
  <text start="966.56" dur="6.21">Russia Tillerson they&amp;#39;re going to stamp</text>
  <text start="969.649" dur="7.201">out a peace deal and once that is done</text>
  <text start="972.77" dur="5.46">it is game over for the Cabal and it</text>
  <text start="976.85" dur="3.03">looks like they&amp;#39;re running out of time</text>
  <text start="978.23" dur="3.419">listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
