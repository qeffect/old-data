  <text start="85.99" dur="4.98">continually taking the information and</text>
  <text start="88.63" dur="4.019">trying to make it seem like we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="90.97" dur="4.289">this incredible recovery now we know the</text>
  <text start="92.649" dur="4.321">unemployment is at five percent which is</text>
  <text start="95.259" dur="4.32">a complete fake phony and false number</text>

  <text start="99.579" dur="5.22">sales they&amp;#39;re not that great actually</text>
  <text start="103.09" dur="4.83">they are terrible at this point because</text>

  <text start="115.03" dur="6.81">back in 2011 2012 when unemployment was</text>
  <text start="118.99" dur="5.39">much much higher so something&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="121.84" dur="4.73">right now but ATP is out there and</text>
  <text start="124.38" dur="6.639">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="126.57" dur="7.87">everything is fine I mean they from</text>
  <text start="131.019" dur="6.69">pumping up lots of jobs in September to</text>
  <text start="134.44" dur="8.19">slowing down in October we see November</text>
  <text start="137.709" dur="9.271">jobs have increased in November beat is</text>
  <text start="142.63" dur="6.3">the biggest since 2014 now which is kind</text>
  <text start="146.98" dur="4.65">of strange because we&amp;#39;ve had all of</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="7.05">these layoffs from major corporations</text>
  <text start="151.63" dur="6.63">and the layoffs continue and when we</text>
  <text start="155.98" dur="3.66">look at additional layoffs that are</text>
  <text start="158.26" dur="2.729">coming up we know that Morgan Stanley&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.64" dur="5.09">can be laying off twenty five percent of</text>
  <text start="160.989" dur="6.301">their staff we see NASA</text>
  <text start="164.73" dur="7.9">their assembly facility is to be laying</text>
  <text start="167.29" dur="10.07">off 200 we see Bryn derson LP laying of</text>
  <text start="172.63" dur="10.77">329 we see Pulaski County Volvo Trucks</text>

  <text start="183.4" dur="10.5">300 and this list goes on and on at this</text>
  <text start="191.38" dur="8.31">point we are approaching a million</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="8.4">layoffs since June of 2014 and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.69" dur="6.93">trying to tell us that everything is</text>
  <text start="202.3" dur="6.42">fine something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense Mark</text>
  <text start="206.62" dur="5.22">Zandi chief economist of moody analytics</text>
  <text start="208.72" dur="5.46">said job growth remains strong and</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="5.04">steady the current pace of job creation</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="5.82">is twice that needed to absorb growth in</text>
  <text start="216.88" dur="6.05">the working age population the economy</text>
  <text start="220" dur="5.82">is fast approaching full employment and</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="9.12">will be there no later than next summer</text>
  <text start="225.82" dur="10.59">and we know that this is completely fake</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="9.4">we know that this is what they say at</text>
  <text start="236.41" dur="8.13">the point leading up to the recession /</text>
  <text start="241.45" dur="5.73">depression / collapse we heard it back</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="6.18">in two thousand eight and we see it</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="5.79">happening right now they&amp;#39;re pushing it</text>
  <text start="250.72" dur="4.62">as hard as they possibly can to make</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="4.44">everyone believe that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="255.34" dur="4.56">except for the hundred million people</text>
  <text start="257.41" dur="3.99">that are out of work and except for the</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="4.2">million people that just been laid off</text>
  <text start="261.4" dur="6.63">last year except for those people that</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="7.71">are being laid off constantly going into</text>
  <text start="268.03" dur="5.88">this holiday season we see in the</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="4.92">housing industry the mortgage</text>
  <text start="273.91" dur="6">applications they&amp;#39;ve fallen once again</text>
  <text start="276.73" dur="5.24">week ending November 27th mortgage</text>
  <text start="279.91" dur="5.01">applications are down point two percent</text>
  <text start="281.97" dur="7.03">refinancing applications plunged six</text>
  <text start="284.92" dur="6.39">percent and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="289" dur="4.77">because the American people just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="5.85">have the money to spend on homes right</text>
  <text start="293.77" dur="4.46">now they don&amp;#39;t have the savings even</text>
  <text start="297.16" dur="2.84">with zero percent</text>
  <text start="298.23" dur="5.76">interest rates even with bringing in</text>
  <text start="300" dur="5.25">subprime people they just can&amp;#39;t do it at</text>
  <text start="303.99" dur="3.51">this point because when you go from a</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="4.14">full-time job to a part-time job it</text>
  <text start="307.5" dur="4.5">makes it very difficult now the</text>
  <text start="309.39" dur="6.3">Millennials they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="312" dur="6">situation here in America and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.69" dur="6.45">saying that the American Dream is really</text>
  <text start="318" dur="8.31">not alive right now I mean these people</text>
  <text start="322.14" dur="6.96">who have gone to college they&amp;#39;re 35 40</text>
  <text start="326.31" dur="6.18">50 thousand dollars in debt they go out</text>
  <text start="329.1" dur="6.39">to the labor force they can&amp;#39;t find the</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="5.67">job in their major making the salary</text>
  <text start="335.49" dur="5.15">they want to afford this debt they end</text>
  <text start="338.16" dur="4.95">up taking a part-time job living at home</text>
  <text start="340.64" dur="4.12">then they need the adjustment on their</text>
  <text start="343.11" dur="4.29">student loan because it goes by what</text>
  <text start="344.76" dur="4.38">your income is today and the income is</text>
  <text start="347.4" dur="3.84">very low so your payments are very small</text>
  <text start="349.14" dur="6.3">so they&amp;#39;re stuck paying out this loan</text>
  <text start="351.24" dur="7.23">for many many years what was the purpose</text>
  <text start="355.44" dur="5.73">in going to college I know many people</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="5.04">who have graduated college can&amp;#39;t find a</text>
  <text start="361.17" dur="3.99">job anywhere yes they have a part-time</text>
  <text start="363.51" dur="5.46">job yes they&amp;#39;re living with their</text>
  <text start="365.16" dur="8.81">parents yes they have a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="368.97" dur="7.83">debt and young workers today they are</text>
  <text start="373.97" dur="5.71">significantly more pessimistic about the</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="8.43">possibility of success in America then</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="8.52">their counterparts back in 1986 and this</text>
  <text start="385.23" dur="6.48">is according to a new fusion 2016 issues</text>
  <text start="388.2" dur="5.46">poll and they&amp;#39;re saying that the people</text>
  <text start="391.71" dur="4.56">who are saying that the American Dream</text>
  <text start="393.66" dur="4.5">is completely dead rose from twelve</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="4.74">percent all the way up to almost thirty</text>
  <text start="398.16" dur="5.4">percent right now this tells you</text>
  <text start="401.01" dur="7.65">something people are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="403.56" dur="6.75">something is wrong in the economy and we</text>
  <text start="408.66" dur="5.64">can see that the US government is</text>
  <text start="410.31" dur="7.47">continually piling on more and more debt</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="11.28">I mean trillions of dollars just in</text>
  <text start="417.78" dur="13.01">November the government added 674</text>
  <text start="425.58" dur="11">billion dollars in debt more than a half</text>
  <text start="430.79" dur="9.24">a trillion in November so that brings</text>
  <text start="436.58" dur="8.64">the debt up to 18 point eight to seven</text>
  <text start="440.03" dur="7.37">trillion I mean this cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="445.22" dur="5.82">this is why interest rates aren&amp;#39;t rising</text>
  <text start="447.4" dur="7.06">this is why all this talk about raising</text>
  <text start="451.04" dur="7.14">interest rates is basically that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="6.09">talk if they decide to go ahead and</text>
  <text start="458.18" dur="5.61">raise the interest rates like they did</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="6.23">back in two thousand eight it will put</text>
  <text start="463.79" dur="7.61">the housing market into a death spiral</text>
  <text start="466.78" dur="9.16">it will make the debt on the country</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="7.75">completely unsustainable the stock</text>
  <text start="475.94" dur="5.31">market would start to collapse the auto</text>
  <text start="479.15" dur="5.79">loan industry would start to collapse</text>
  <text start="481.25" dur="6.51">and the whole thing would start to fall</text>
  <text start="484.94" dur="6.96">apart this is what happened in 2008 if</text>
  <text start="487.76" dur="6.15">we see the Fed finally say okay we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="491.9" dur="5.52">going to bring it up 10 basis points 15</text>
  <text start="493.91" dur="6.51">basis point this is the signal they are</text>
  <text start="497.42" dur="4.68">getting ready to bring this down now of</text>
  <text start="500.42" dur="3.33">course they&amp;#39;re not going to raise it and</text>
  <text start="502.1" dur="3.06">all of a sudden that&amp;#39;s going to collapse</text>
  <text start="503.75" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;d be ridiculous because everyone</text>
  <text start="505.16" dur="2.85">would look at them and say okay you just</text>
  <text start="506.9" dur="3.39">raise the interest rates and it</text>
  <text start="508.01" dur="4.86">collapsed what did you just do it&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="510.29" dur="5.129">fault know what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="512.87" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;ll raise it a little bit we&amp;#39;ll hear</text>
  <text start="515.419" dur="4.171">you know different parts of the country</text>
  <text start="517.61" dur="4.23">hurting a little bit but nothing too bad</text>
  <text start="519.59" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;ll keep the propaganda going that</text>
  <text start="521.84" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re in this recovery and they&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="524.18" dur="6.18">see we&amp;#39;re able to raise it everything is</text>
  <text start="526.4" dur="6.33">fine we didn&amp;#39;t collapse the next time</text>
  <text start="530.36" dur="4.92">they go ahead to do it which they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="532.73" dur="4.5">never get to because they will create an</text>
  <text start="535.28" dur="4.62">event and blame it on into the country</text>
  <text start="537.23" dur="5.16">or group before it happens this way they</text>
  <text start="539.9" dur="4.71">can say see we were in a recovery we</text>
  <text start="542.39" dur="4.77">were bringing up the interest rates we</text>
  <text start="544.61" dur="4.73">were going to do it once again and look</text>
  <text start="547.16" dur="4.44">what happened you can&amp;#39;t blame us and</text>
  <text start="549.34" dur="5.17">this is what they&amp;#39;re planning at this</text>
  <text start="551.6" dur="7.46">point so that is a signal to everyone</text>
  <text start="554.51" dur="6.3">that when they go ahead and they do this</text>
  <text start="559.06" dur="3.43">they&amp;#39;re ready to bring it down</text>
  <text start="560.81" dur="3.78">themselves now there could be a Black</text>
  <text start="562.49" dur="5.16">Swan there could be an event</text>
  <text start="564.59" dur="6.72">they can&amp;#39;t control and it will happen</text>
  <text start="567.65" dur="5.58">anyhow but again whatever the event is</text>
  <text start="571.31" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re going to try to turn around and</text>
  <text start="573.23" dur="7.47">blame it on another country or group now</text>
  <text start="577.7" dur="5.7">more norm strong is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.7" dur="4.98">saying central bankers are just trapped</text>
  <text start="583.4" dur="5.81">they they have no way out of this</text>
  <text start="585.68" dur="6.89">whatsoever their credibility is shot</text>
  <text start="589.21" dur="5.53">they can&amp;#39;t raise the interest rates and</text>
  <text start="592.57" dur="6.58">they&amp;#39;re having troubles right now</text>
  <text start="594.74" dur="7.32">because the ECB the Fed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="599.15" dur="5.28">continually creating money out of thin</text>
  <text start="602.06" dur="8.61">air I should say currency out of thin</text>
  <text start="604.43" dur="9">air buying their own bonds and this</text>
  <text start="610.67" dur="6">whole system is starting to shake and</text>
  <text start="613.43" dur="5.64">crumble apart we are already seeing this</text>
  <text start="616.67" dur="4.38">in different countries where countries</text>

  <text start="674.23" dur="7.96">afloat for much longer and this is why</text>
  <text start="678.77" dur="7.56">we see this incredible push to get</text>

  <text start="730.919" dur="5.371">this warming trend over the last 100</text>
  <text start="733.109" dur="5.82">years we can see that the data has been</text>
  <text start="736.29" dur="5.909">fraudulently altered to show a warming</text>

  <text start="758.149" dur="3.94">manipulate the numbers now it&amp;#39;s very odd</text>
  <text start="760.379" dur="3.36">because people have a very hard time</text>
  <text start="762.089" dur="4.46">believing that they would manipulate</text>
  <text start="763.739" dur="4.68">these numbers but they have an easy time</text>
  <text start="766.549" dur="5.29">believing that they&amp;#39;d manipulate</text>
  <text start="768.419" dur="6.51">unemployment they manipulate GDP they</text>
  <text start="771.839" dur="5.641">manipulate inflation they would create</text>
  <text start="774.929" dur="3.87">false flags around the world but when it</text>
  <text start="777.48" dur="3.149">comes to this people have a problem</text>
  <text start="778.799" dur="5.82">saying they would never do this of</text>
  <text start="780.629" dur="9.481">course they would this agenda right here</text>

  <text start="790.11" dur="7.339">making it seem like it does but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="792.239" dur="9.111">pushing the idea that co2 is a bad thing</text>
  <text start="797.449" dur="6.85">actually co2 is a gift to the planet</text>
  <text start="801.35" dur="8.189">which creates food abundance and</text>
  <text start="804.299" dur="7.23">reforestation as co2 levels rise and</text>
  <text start="809.539" dur="5.02">basically what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="811.529" dur="5.93">trying to confuse people and pollution</text>
  <text start="814.559" dur="6.541">and co2 they&amp;#39;re two separate things and</text>
  <text start="817.459" dur="5.53">the government right now basically</text>
  <text start="821.1" dur="4.319">destroys the careers of scientists who</text>
  <text start="822.989" dur="5.691">aren&amp;#39;t willing to perpetrate the global</text>
  <text start="825.419" dur="5.241">warming hoax and there</text>
  <text start="828.68" dur="4.53">pushing this right now now Putin was</text>
  <text start="830.66" dur="5.1">already out there telling the world that</text>
  <text start="833.21" dur="7.08">yet global warming is completely fake</text>
  <text start="835.76" dur="7.32">now China on the other hand isn&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="840.29" dur="4.26">along with it either now in the</text>
  <text start="843.08" dur="4.65">corporate media it seems like they are</text>
  <text start="844.55" dur="5.159">but they&amp;#39;re really not Barack Obama</text>
  <text start="847.73" dur="4.32">stated the fact of the matter is that</text>
  <text start="849.709" dur="3.811">there&amp;#39;s a reason why you have the</text>
  <text start="852.05" dur="3.27">largest gathering of world leaders</text>
  <text start="853.52" dur="5.34">probably in the world history here in</text>

  <text start="858.86" dur="6">change seriously which again whatever he</text>
  <text start="862.339" dur="3.781">says is completely opposite where most</text>
  <text start="864.86" dur="5.58">of the people are saying no this is a</text>
  <text start="866.12" dur="6.21">complete hoax now we know the president</text>
  <text start="870.44" dur="4.92">right now is trying to push his pushes</text>
  <text start="872.33" dur="6.96">agenda to push a carbon tax on the</text>
  <text start="875.36" dur="10.5">people and basically what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="879.29" dur="8.85">right now is that China believe that the</text>
  <text start="885.86" dur="5.13">global warming that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="888.14" dur="4.949">push this climate change and we know the</text>
  <text start="890.99" dur="5.19">climate is always changing the Sun</text>
  <text start="893.089" dur="6.891">controls it the humans on this planet</text>
  <text start="896.18" dur="8.73">are a small very very tiny little</text>
  <text start="899.98" dur="9.12">miniscule component of it which really</text>
  <text start="904.91" dur="7.79">has no effect and China right now</text>
  <text start="909.1" dur="6.58">understands that this is a complete hoax</text>
  <text start="912.7" dur="5.38">we know this because of a devastating</text>
  <text start="915.68" dur="4.17">report released by the global warming</text>
  <text start="918.08" dur="4.199">policy foundation written by one of the</text>

  <text start="934.97" dur="6.23">Chinese real position on climate change</text>
  <text start="938.17" dur="8.909">China sees it as a brilliant opportunity</text>
  <text start="941.2" dur="8.8">to fleece the gullible Western world and</text>
  <text start="947.079" dur="7.421">basically extract as much money from</text>
  <text start="950" dur="7.709">them as they can so they know what the</text>
  <text start="954.5" dur="5.7">US is doing at this point the West</text>
  <text start="957.709" dur="4.801">either knows this or strongly suspects</text>
  <text start="960.2" dur="5.1">this that China understand</text>
  <text start="962.51" dur="5.19">what&amp;#39;s really going on so any agreement</text>
  <text start="965.3" dur="4.35">reached next week which pretends</text>
  <text start="967.7" dur="4.71">otherwise will either be a fudge a lie</text>
  <text start="969.65" dur="5.28">or an outright capitulation by Western</text>
  <text start="972.41" dur="6.9">negotiators because China knows that it</text>
  <text start="974.93" dur="8.16">wants what it wants and it isn&amp;#39;t budging</text>
  <text start="979.31" dur="6.06">on what it believes and of course Obama</text>
  <text start="983.09" dur="3.72">and the other Western leaders like to</text>
  <text start="985.37" dur="4.05">pretend that china is appalling air</text>

  <text start="993.35" dur="4.98">it a strong incentive to reduce co2</text>
  <text start="996.05" dur="5.37">levels but in fact the opposite is true</text>
  <text start="998.33" dur="5.82">that&amp;#39;s because China understands as the</text>
  <text start="1001.42" dur="7.59">West pretends not to this that co2 and</text>
  <text start="1004.15" dur="6.54">pollution are very different things so</text>
