  <text start="102.2" dur="4.05">they like to put out manipulated</text>
  <text start="103.64" dur="4.53">information the corporate media loves to</text>
  <text start="106.25" dur="4.229">do this they&amp;#39;ll tell you that all retail</text>
  <text start="108.17" dur="4.47">is doing the best that we&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text>
  <text start="110.479" dur="4.651">in our lifetime this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="112.64" dur="4.8">retailers needed the retail apocalypse</text>
  <text start="115.13" dur="7.23">has been called off everything is great</text>
  <text start="117.44" dur="7.099">the economy&amp;#39;s doing fine and when you</text>
  <text start="122.36" dur="5.099">really look at these numbers we see that</text>
  <text start="124.539" dur="7.03">something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now yes</text>
  <text start="127.459" dur="6.061">retail has ticked up a little bit and it</text>
  <text start="131.569" dur="4.201">didn&amp;#39;t mean expectations of what they</text>
  <text start="133.52" dur="5.96">thought December was going to be like</text>
  <text start="135.77" dur="7.26">now sales growth was about 0.3%</text>
  <text start="139.48" dur="7.33">month-on-month does that sound really</text>
  <text start="143.03" dur="6.42">that great no it doesn&amp;#39;t because what we</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="5.88">need to do is we need to go back in time</text>
  <text start="149.45" dur="9.6">a little bit if we go back to last</text>
  <text start="152.69" dur="9.09">holiday season 2016 going into 2017 they</text>
  <text start="159.05" dur="5.64">had headlines out there and one of the</text>
  <text start="161.78" dur="5.429">headline says retail sales jump in</text>
  <text start="164.69" dur="6.81">December on strong car and online</text>
  <text start="167.209" dur="8.601">shopping retail sales increased by 0.6</text>
  <text start="171.5" dur="6.54">percent from a revised point two percent</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="5.11">now let&amp;#39;s think about that for a second</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="5.369">they&amp;#39;re telling us and this was last</text>
  <text start="180.92" dur="4.649">holiday season where we reported that</text>
  <text start="183.409" dur="3.301">the holiday season was a complete</text>
  <text start="185.569" dur="3.991">disaster</text>
  <text start="186.71" dur="6.06">they were telling us that the retail</text>
  <text start="189.56" dur="5.22">industry grew by 0.6% now first they had</text>
  <text start="192.77" dur="3.15">the numbers out of 0.2% and then revised</text>
  <text start="194.78" dur="3.75">them to 0.6%</text>
  <text start="195.92" dur="5.88">and then in the year of 2017 stores</text>
  <text start="198.53" dur="6.5">closed down this year we&amp;#39;re getting an</text>
  <text start="201.8" dur="7.02">increase of 0.3%</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="6.19">hmm very interesting what does that tell</text>
  <text start="208.82" dur="4.32">us it tells us these numbers are</text>
  <text start="211.22" dur="3.69">manipulated and if we go by what</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="5.07">happened last year and we look at this</text>
  <text start="214.91" dur="5.25">year you know this number is much much</text>
  <text start="218.21" dur="3.18">lower you know they&amp;#39;re gonna revise it</text>
  <text start="220.16" dur="2.94">and make it seem like you know retail</text>
  <text start="221.39" dur="5.16">was that point eight percent but once</text>
  <text start="223.1" dur="6.39">again you have to understand sales does</text>
  <text start="226.55" dur="5.22">not equal profits just because sales are</text>
  <text start="229.49" dur="3.99">at point three percent doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="231.77" dur="3.33">these stores made a profit maybe their</text>
  <text start="233.48" dur="3.3">profit margin maybe they had to put</text>
  <text start="235.1" dur="3.87">these things on sale and they only made</text>
  <text start="236.78" dur="5.07">a dollar from each sale can the store</text>
  <text start="238.97" dur="5.37">stay open no and then we break it down</text>
  <text start="241.85" dur="4.23">even further and we look at some of the</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="3.03">sales like electronics well on the</text>
  <text start="246.08" dur="5.1">mother December they were down by</text>
  <text start="247.37" dur="6.24">negative 0.2 percent that&amp;#39;s not good we</text>
  <text start="251.18" dur="6.24">look at clothing clothing accessories</text>
  <text start="253.61" dur="6.18">down- 0.3 percent we look at Sporting</text>
  <text start="257.42" dur="4.73">Goods hobby book and music stores they</text>
  <text start="259.79" dur="4.32">were down negative 1.6 percent</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="4.48">miscellaneous store retailers were down</text>
  <text start="264.11" dur="6.09">negative 2.9 percent general merchandise</text>
  <text start="266.63" dur="5.97">stores department stores negative 1.1</text>
  <text start="270.2" dur="5.49">percent there were some places where</text>
  <text start="272.6" dur="6.36">sales were up motor vehicle parts point</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="6.3">four percent we see furniture was up</text>
  <text start="278.96" dur="6.48">point six percent but the things that</text>
  <text start="281.99" dur="6.42">you purchase for the holiday season it</text>
  <text start="285.44" dur="4.47">seems like those were all down but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.41" dur="3.48">getting these sales numbers and we&amp;#39;ll go</text>
  <text start="289.91" dur="4.65">with them again we&amp;#39;re not getting the</text>
  <text start="291.89" dur="5.28">actual numbers from the stores and those</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="5.7">are gonna be very very different now</text>
  <text start="297.17" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us and they</text>
  <text start="300.26" dur="3.84">keep putting out by the way those you</text>
  <text start="301.97" dur="4.32">know those credit card numbers where oh</text>
  <text start="304.1" dur="4.17">look it&amp;#39;s up by four point nine percent</text>
  <text start="306.29" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s not really up by four point nine</text>
  <text start="308.27" dur="4.2">percent because you need to look at the</text>
  <text start="310.1" dur="6.3">past numbers and if you look at the past</text>
  <text start="312.47" dur="6.33">numbers it&amp;#39;s up like like 0.5% but they</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="3.93">like to put out those numbers anyhow now</text>
  <text start="318.8" dur="6.869">while all this is going</text>
  <text start="320.33" dur="8.399">on savings is at a ten-year low people</text>
  <text start="325.669" dur="6.93">have no savings and if you take this a</text>
  <text start="328.729" dur="6.741">step further credit card borrowing hit</text>
  <text start="332.599" dur="6.75">all-time new highs now if we go back to</text>
  <text start="335.47" dur="7.9">2007 going into 2008 we&amp;#39;re at that same</text>
  <text start="339.349" dur="7.051">point so they didn&amp;#39;t meet expectations</text>
  <text start="343.37" dur="5.49">the retailer&amp;#39;s it was very close to the</text>
  <text start="346.4" dur="3.93">same exact number that we had last year</text>
  <text start="348.86" dur="2.64">which was point two percent of course</text>
  <text start="350.33" dur="3.66">that revised at two point six percent</text>
  <text start="351.5" dur="5.28">these point you know percentage numbers</text>
  <text start="353.99" dur="4.919">are ridiculous anyhow because the sales</text>
  <text start="356.78" dur="5.039">were very very low last year this is not</text>
  <text start="358.909" dur="6.72">going to help and we already see that</text>
  <text start="361.819" dur="5.94">Macy&amp;#39;s is closing we see Sam&amp;#39;s Club is</text>
  <text start="365.629" dur="4.981">closing Sears is going to be declaring</text>
  <text start="367.759" dur="6.75">bankruptcy Neiman Marcus right now is</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="7.17">facing bankruptcy and this is coming</text>
  <text start="374.509" dur="6.301">from credit risk monitor and we know</text>
  <text start="377.78" dur="6.3">that there are other stores montón Sears</text>
  <text start="380.81" dur="6.09">holding and many others they&amp;#39;re all on</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="8.519">the verge of crashing now remember the</text>
  <text start="386.9" dur="9">retail debt comes due this year now the</text>
  <text start="392.599" dur="5.82">question is do these retailers have</text>
  <text start="395.9" dur="4.41">enough to pay for the debt or are they</text>
  <text start="398.419" dur="4.141">gonna have to get more debt to pay for</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="6.659">that debt and then this is where stores</text>
  <text start="402.56" dur="8.579">get into trouble again sales and profits</text>
  <text start="406.969" dur="6.331">are two separate things and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="411.139" dur="6.361">looking at this economy and it is</text>
  <text start="413.3" dur="7.44">completely manipulated to make you think</text>
  <text start="417.5" dur="5.46">that it is doing well I mean the</text>
  <text start="420.74" dur="4.829">headlines when you read them you think</text>
  <text start="422.96" dur="5.88">that everything was great this is what</text>
  <text start="425.569" dur="6.361">they do they manipulate what is really</text>
  <text start="428.84" dur="6.329">going on because they want everyone all</text>
  <text start="431.93" dur="6.81">in because when everyone is all in this</text>
  <text start="435.169" dur="7.231">is when they pull the plug and the</text>
  <text start="438.74" dur="5.94">economy comes down it&amp;#39;s the same exact</text>
  <text start="442.4" dur="5.1">thing they&amp;#39;ve done time and time again</text>
  <text start="444.68" dur="5.729">and when I say they it&amp;#39;s the central</text>
  <text start="447.5" dur="6.63">bank we see the core consumer prices</text>
  <text start="450.409" dur="8.031">they have risen faster than expected</text>
  <text start="454.13" dur="6.69">and once again inflation is rising</text>
  <text start="458.44" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re using a lot of manipulation to</text>
  <text start="460.82" dur="4.62">make us believe that inflation is not</text>
  <text start="463.31" dur="5.52">rising but it it&amp;#39;s moving very very</text>
  <text start="465.44" dur="6.51">quickly to the upside and this is with</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="5.52">housing it&amp;#39;s with college tuition we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.95" dur="4.74">seeing it with many other things food</text>
  <text start="474.35" dur="4.08">and many other things where we see</text>
  <text start="476.69" dur="3.99">inflation moving up and they also off</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="4.05">oh the stock market they also offloaded</text>
  <text start="480.68" dur="5.16">a lot of inflation out of this country</text>
  <text start="482.48" dur="6.09">and we can see that as we look at this</text>
  <text start="485.84" dur="4.26">economy and as they continually</text>
  <text start="488.57" dur="3.81">manipulate it it just gets worse and</text>
  <text start="490.1" dur="4.08">worse now what&amp;#39;s very interesting we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="492.38" dur="4.2">been reporting on how the housing market</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="4.44">has been doing and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.58" dur="3.96">telling us these 20 cities prices are</text>
  <text start="498.62" dur="4.19">moving up and that means everything is</text>
  <text start="500.54" dur="5.97">great which is meaningless because in</text>
  <text start="502.81" dur="5.17">2007 going into 2008 housing prices were</text>
  <text start="506.51" dur="3.78">at the highest we&amp;#39;ve ever seen before</text>
  <text start="507.98" dur="4.41">and that didn&amp;#39;t mean that economy was</text>
  <text start="510.29" dur="4.05">doing well actually that meant the</text>
  <text start="512.39" dur="4.2">opposite the economy started to break</text>
  <text start="514.34" dur="3.6">down crash because of all the underlying</text>
  <text start="516.59" dur="3.24">things that they do really didn&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="517.94" dur="4.289">us about but this is what they do they</text>
  <text start="519.83" dur="4.08">keep everyone in the dark now Wells</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="4.281">Fargo there who entire almost their</text>
  <text start="523.91" dur="5.58">entire business is on mortgages and</text>
  <text start="526.51" dur="5.77">right now they have reported the worst</text>
  <text start="529.49" dur="7.62">mortgage number since the financial</text>
  <text start="532.28" dur="7.35">crisis how could this be if the real</text>
  <text start="537.11" dur="6.3">estate market is doing so fantastically</text>
  <text start="539.63" dur="6.96">and everyone&amp;#39;s buying a house well we</text>
  <text start="543.41" dur="4.92">debunked that a long time ago and what</text>
  <text start="546.59" dur="4.38">we when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="548.33" dur="7.11">Wells Fargo mortgage application</text>
  <text start="550.97" dur="7.41">pipeline plunged by a whopping 23% to</text>
  <text start="555.44" dur="4.65">just twenty three billion I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.38" dur="5.55">almost back to the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="560.09" dur="6.84">level I mean this is unbelievable</text>
  <text start="563.93" dur="5.66">and we could see that this isn&amp;#39;t getting</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="8.64">any better and this has been declining</text>
  <text start="569.59" dur="10.87">since 2012 and it had a little pop up</text>
  <text start="575.57" dur="8.01">but the trajectory is downward now when</text>
  <text start="580.46" dur="4.64">we look at the bank&amp;#39;s consumer loan</text>
  <text start="583.58" dur="4.52">trends</text>
  <text start="585.1" dur="6.03">these reveal that they of cycling credit</text>
  <text start="588.1" dur="7.68">cards the there&amp;#39;s a huge decline in</text>
  <text start="591.13" dur="9.9">credit demand and people are not taking</text>
  <text start="595.78" dur="8.1">out loans we know mortgages we know</text>
  <text start="601.03" dur="5.34">automobile is on a decline if we look at</text>
  <text start="603.88" dur="5.58">the fourth quarter of 2016 third quarter</text>
  <text start="606.37" dur="5.37">2017 fourth quarter of 2017 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="609.46" dur="5.4">declining other revolving credit</text>
  <text start="611.74" dur="5.22">installments is declining and what these</text>
  <text start="614.86" dur="5.16">numbers disturbingly reveal is that the</text>
  <text start="616.96" dur="5.19">average US consumer cannot afford to</text>
  <text start="620.02" dur="7.38">take out mortgages at a time when rates</text>
  <text start="622.15" dur="7.44">rise by as little as 1% it also means</text>
  <text start="627.4" dur="4.5">that if the Fed is truly intended</text>
  <text start="629.59" dur="4.05">engineering a parallel shift in the</text>
  <text start="631.9" dur="4.56">curve of two to three percent the u.s.</text>
  <text start="633.64" dur="6.48">can kiss its domestic housing market</text>
  <text start="636.46" dur="7.65">goodbye what what this means is is that</text>
  <text start="640.12" dur="7.23">if these rates move up it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="644.11" dur="6.78">knock thousands upon thousands of people</text>
  <text start="647.35" dur="7.38">out of the housing market which means</text>
  <text start="650.89" dur="8.03">the housing market is going to crash hmm</text>
  <text start="654.73" dur="6.72">didn&amp;#39;t we see this before we did back in</text>
  <text start="658.92" dur="4.87">2006-2007 when they were raising the</text>
  <text start="661.45" dur="4.35">rates people who had adjustable rate</text>
  <text start="663.79" dur="3.39">mortgages just left their home because</text>
  <text start="665.8" dur="3.5">it didn&amp;#39;t matter if they refinance it</text>
  <text start="667.18" dur="4.95">the rates were too high it pushed</text>
  <text start="669.3" dur="6.21">millions of people out of the housing</text>
  <text start="672.13" dur="6.36">market it crashed the housing market and</text>
  <text start="675.51" dur="4.3">that had a domino effect on the rest of</text>
  <text start="678.49" dur="2.88">the economy there were other things</text>
  <text start="679.81" dur="4.14">happening of course we had the fake</text>
  <text start="681.37" dur="3.93">subprime securities we had corporations</text>
  <text start="683.95" dur="4.05">that were pretending that everything was</text>
  <text start="685.3" dur="4.68">fine when they were really bankrupt they</text>
  <text start="688" dur="4.53">couldn&amp;#39;t survive they needed billions</text>
  <text start="689.98" dur="4.77">upon billions of dollars guess what</text>
  <text start="692.53" dur="6.62">people the same thing is happening now</text>
  <text start="694.75" dur="7.38">but it&amp;#39;s much much worse now bill Dudley</text>
  <text start="699.15" dur="5.17">he is the second most important person</text>
  <text start="702.13" dur="5.43">in the Federal Reserve and he said the</text>
  <text start="704.32" dur="6.09">following which is very interesting he</text>
  <text start="707.56" dur="6.78">admitted that there are risks in the</text>
  <text start="710.41" dur="5.91">economy and he&amp;#39;s concerned about the</text>
  <text start="714.34" dur="4.35">long-term fiscal position of the United</text>
  <text start="716.32" dur="5.16">States the US debt</text>
  <text start="718.69" dur="5.519">specifically Dudley said that the Trump</text>

  <text start="1084.159" dur="3.63">bad people it&amp;#39;s because we don&amp;#39;t want</text>

  <text start="1111.159" dur="4.441">the other countries have rules and</text>
  <text start="1112.57" dur="5.25">regulations we&amp;#39;ll be okay</text>
