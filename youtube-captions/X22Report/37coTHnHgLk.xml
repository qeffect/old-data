  <text start="58.039" dur="6.061">episode 1400 5b and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.309" dur="5.131">October 19th 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.1" dur="4.1">episode is the event warning meter has</text>
  <text start="66.44" dur="4.289">hit Code Red</text>
  <text start="68.2" dur="5.5">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="70.729" dur="7.491">political and geopolitical news now we</text>
  <text start="73.7" dur="7.26">understand that crypto currency is</text>
  <text start="78.22" dur="4.03">something new out there and many people</text>
  <text start="80.96" dur="3.24">call it a bubble but I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="82.25" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s that many people in there where</text>
  <text start="84.2" dur="4.83">it can be called a bubble as of yet we</text>
  <text start="86.27" dur="4.08">know the central banking system they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="89.03" dur="3.869">looking into it they&amp;#39;re trying to create</text>
  <text start="90.35" dur="5.73">their own type of crypto coin we know</text>
  <text start="92.899" dur="4.801">the IMF Director Christine Lagarde has</text>
  <text start="96.08" dur="4.849">been looking at it saying you know oh</text>
  <text start="97.7" dur="5.94">maybe we should go in this direction and</text>
  <text start="100.929" dur="4.3">we understand that cryptocurrencies have</text>
  <text start="103.64" dur="4.769">gone up they&amp;#39;ve gone down they have gone</text>
  <text start="105.229" dur="4.711">up once again and Bitcoin like coin -</text>
  <text start="108.409" dur="3.291">and there&amp;#39;s you know something like a</text>
  <text start="109.94" dur="5.039">thousand of them or something out there</text>
  <text start="111.7" dur="6.519">well the wealthy people they realized</text>
  <text start="114.979" dur="6.051">that eventually this most likely will be</text>
  <text start="118.219" dur="6.271">the electronic form of our currency and</text>
  <text start="121.03" dur="6.909">they&amp;#39;ve been socking crypto currency</text>
  <text start="124.49" dur="6.14">away and basically what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="127.939" dur="6.601">doing is they&amp;#39;ve been hiding their</text>
  <text start="130.63" dur="6.97">cryptocurrency in Switzerland and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="134.54" dur="5.88">hidden underground in a vault now this</text>
  <text start="137.6" dur="8.04">is not physical what they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="11.43">doing is they are storing their private</text>
  <text start="145.64" dur="10.11">keys on drives in a vault in Switzerland</text>
  <text start="151.85" dur="8.1">under ground and there&amp;#39;s billions upon</text>
  <text start="155.75" dur="6.03">billions that are there now again you</text>
  <text start="159.95" dur="7.77">need your private key and your public</text>
  <text start="161.78" dur="9.06">key to basically access your holdings so</text>
  <text start="167.72" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re not physically storing that</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="4.769">information or though they&amp;#39;re coins</text>
  <text start="173.51" dur="4.92">digitally they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re storing</text>
  <text start="175.609" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re private and the public key</text>
  <text start="178.43" dur="3.6">doesn&amp;#39;t have to be sort but the private</text>
  <text start="179.989" dur="4.17">key so they can have access later on</text>
  <text start="182.03" dur="4.47">because remember everything is kept on a</text>
  <text start="184.159" dur="4.561">ledger and it&amp;#39;s distributed throughout</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="4.32">world on different systems and it always</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="3.33">keeps track of all this that goes back</text>
  <text start="190.82" dur="3.42">to the beginning and recalculates</text>
  <text start="192.05" dur="5.73">everything to the to the present day now</text>
  <text start="194.24" dur="6.15">this is in a Swiss military facility</text>
  <text start="197.78" dur="4.11">built in 1947 and it served as the</text>
  <text start="200.39" dur="4.98">Army&amp;#39;s secret headquarters during the</text>
  <text start="201.89" dur="6.3">Cold War and you can see with inside the</text>
  <text start="205.37" dur="5.64">vault they&amp;#39;re still old naps and clocks</text>
  <text start="208.19" dur="5.37">and radios and things like that but what</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="4.77">is set up inside is these computer</text>
  <text start="213.56" dur="4.05">systems and the computer systems they</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="5.58">have a lot of hard drives in them it</text>
  <text start="217.61" dur="6.15">also is shielded so and protected from</text>
  <text start="221.36" dur="5.73">where the barrier will protect</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="5.76">everything from an EMP type of blast so</text>
  <text start="227.09" dur="5.16">nothing will be erased on the drives so</text>
  <text start="229.52" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re wealthy are storing their</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="6.56">private keys in this area and they are</text>
  <text start="235.19" dur="7.95">continually collecting more and more</text>
  <text start="238.81" dur="6.45">cryptocurrencies and we can see that</text>
  <text start="243.14" dur="5.91">they are getting prepared and ready for</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="5.56">this new currency type of system and I</text>
  <text start="249.05" dur="3.93">do believe that crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="250.82" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re going to play some type of role</text>
  <text start="252.98" dur="7.77">now last report we mentioned the story</text>
  <text start="257.33" dur="7.08">about the Clintons Russia Obama the</text>
  <text start="260.75" dur="5.669">uranium deal extortion bribery some</text>
  <text start="264.41" dur="4.97">people taking bribes and things like</text>
  <text start="266.419" dur="6.06">that going to speeches going into</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="6.4">different funds and we see at this point</text>
  <text start="272.479" dur="5.101">that this type of news now is gaining</text>
  <text start="275.78" dur="4.92">traction actually Trump is tweeting</text>
  <text start="277.58" dur="4.77">about it and the corporate media is kind</text>
  <text start="280.7" dur="4.08">of talking about it but not really</text>
  <text start="282.35" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re kind of hands-off right now but</text>
  <text start="284.78" dur="3.99">there is an FBI informant that was</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="3.57">looking at the details looking at the</text>
  <text start="288.77" dur="5.22">information and this FBI informant is</text>
  <text start="290.72" dur="6.87">being threatened right now not to say</text>
  <text start="293.99" dur="5.82">anything and the informant right now the</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="4.92">codename for this person is confidential</text>
  <text start="299.81" dur="4.44">source one says that when he attempted</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="3.45">to come forward last year with</text>
  <text start="304.25" dur="4.2">information that linked the Clinton</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="4.95">Foundation directly to the scandal he</text>
  <text start="308.45" dur="5.73">was promptly silenced by the FBI and the</text>
  <text start="310.91" dur="5.49">Obama administration and we see at this</text>
  <text start="314.18" dur="4.68">point that they don&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="3.9">talking because this is the real story</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="2.429">this is what the corporate</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="2.579">he doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone to know about</text>
  <text start="321.289" dur="2.611">this is what the Clintons don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="322.879" dur="2.76">anyone to know about is what Obama</text>
  <text start="323.9" dur="4.799">doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone to know about and</text>
  <text start="325.639" dur="5.581">like I said these truth bombs they are</text>
  <text start="328.699" dur="4.321">coming out and they&amp;#39;re coming out all</text>
  <text start="331.22" dur="4.229">over the place and eventually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="333.02" dur="5.519">gonna gain traction and people are gonna</text>
  <text start="335.449" dur="3.87">ask questions and this is going to gain</text>
  <text start="338.539" dur="4.321">momentum</text>
  <text start="339.319" dur="5.07">just like the spying on Trump everyone</text>
  <text start="342.86" dur="3.57">said this is ridiculous this didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="344.389" dur="4.74">happen and then as people looked into it</text>
  <text start="346.43" dur="4.59">well it did look like it happened the</text>
  <text start="349.129" dur="3.271">Russian collusion story that was</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="2.94">completely fake phony and false because</text>
  <text start="352.4" dur="3.479">that was made up by the intelligence</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="3.929">agencies by the Cabal by the corporate</text>
  <text start="355.879" dur="7.38">media now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="357.889" dur="10.891">that the former FEC chair and her name</text>
  <text start="363.259" dur="8.9">is Ann Ravel she&amp;#39;s a Berkeley lecturer</text>
  <text start="368.78" dur="9.27">and she&amp;#39;s a former FEC chair</text>
  <text start="372.159" dur="9.421">she has created this disinformation grec</text>
  <text start="378.05" dur="8.16">crackdown paper and she&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="381.58" dur="9.089">the government needs to control the</text>
  <text start="386.21" dur="8.06">disinformation on the Internet and</text>
  <text start="390.669" dur="5.981">basically what she didn&amp;#39;t do is really</text>
  <text start="394.27" dur="5.709">describe what she means by</text>
  <text start="396.65" dur="6.69">disinformation now she&amp;#39;s pushing a</text>
  <text start="399.979" dur="7.59">proposal that she said she laid out in</text>
  <text start="403.34" dur="5.91">the paper to combat fake news and the</text>
  <text start="407.569" dur="3.541">regulation would include the targeting</text>
  <text start="409.25" dur="4.65">of people who share stories deemed fake</text>
  <text start="411.11" dur="4.919">or disinformation by government</text>
  <text start="413.9" dur="4.68">regulators in addition to new rules on</text>
  <text start="416.029" dur="4.92">paid ads Ravel wants fake news to be</text>
  <text start="418.58" dur="4.649">regulated under her proposal titled</text>
  <text start="420.949" dur="5.131">foonly wants the case for government</text>
  <text start="423.229" dur="5.34">regulation of fake news if adopted a</text>
  <text start="426.08" dur="4.559">social media user would be flagged for</text>
  <text start="428.569" dur="5.28">sharing anything deemed false by</text>
  <text start="430.639" dur="5.671">regulators well let&amp;#39;s just look at this</text>
  <text start="433.849" dur="4.53">for a second first of all the corporate</text>
  <text start="436.31" dur="3.81">media was out there and they were saying</text>
  <text start="438.379" dur="4.051">that this Russian collusion was a true</text>
  <text start="440.12" dur="4.22">story the alternative media saying well</text>
  <text start="442.43" dur="4.62">we looked into this there&amp;#39;s nothing here</text>
  <text start="444.34" dur="5.35">Project Veritas went undercover and</text>
  <text start="447.05" dur="4.169">proved that this was a nothing burger</text>
  <text start="449.69" dur="4.47">they had nothing it was all completely</text>
  <text start="451.219" dur="4.831">made-up so at this point it</text>
  <text start="454.16" dur="4.23">like the corporate media was spreading</text>
  <text start="456.05" dur="4.2">disinformation and this is where the</text>
  <text start="458.39" dur="4.95">problem comes in because who are they</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="4.77">going to actually stop is it going to be</text>
  <text start="463.34" dur="2.85">the corporate media is it gonna be the</text>
  <text start="465.02" dur="3.12">alternative media well we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.19" dur="3.69">gonna be the alternative media but we</text>
  <text start="468.14" dur="4.02">can see what they&amp;#39;re trying to do here</text>
  <text start="469.88" dur="7.44">and so basically what she&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="472.16" dur="7.77">and what her paper is proposing and I</text>
  <text start="477.32" dur="5.25">quote after a social media user clicks</text>
  <text start="479.93" dur="4.89">share on a disputed item if the</text>
  <text start="482.57" dur="4.95">platform&amp;#39;s do not remove them and only</text>
  <text start="484.82" dur="4.83">label them as disputed government can</text>
  <text start="487.52" dur="4.5">require that the user be reminded of the</text>
  <text start="489.65" dur="5.67">definition of libel against a public</text>
  <text start="492.02" dur="6.03">figure libel of a public figure requires</text>
  <text start="495.32" dur="5.67">actual malice defined as knowledge of</text>
  <text start="498.05" dur="5.49">falsity or reckless disregard for the</text>
  <text start="500.99" dur="6.09">truth sharing an item that has been</text>
  <text start="503.54" dur="5.88">flagged as unique I mean as untrue might</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="5.81">trigger liability under the libel laws</text>
  <text start="509.42" dur="8.13">so basically if you share a story and</text>
  <text start="512.89" dur="11.2">they demit as disinformation you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="517.55" dur="9.9">liable and again who is deciding if a</text>
  <text start="524.09" dur="5.66">story is true or untrue because if you</text>
  <text start="527.45" dur="5.91">have facts behind it</text>
  <text start="529.75" dur="5.83">then what I mean the corporate media</text>
  <text start="533.36" dur="5.16">they kept repeating Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="535.58" dur="4.98">Russian collusion Russia cyberattack the</text>
  <text start="538.52" dur="5.1">elections but they never showed proof</text>
  <text start="540.56" dur="5.16">and it turned out to be false and this</text>
  <text start="543.62" dur="4.53">is going to be a problem but you could</text>
  <text start="545.72" dur="5.07">see what they&amp;#39;re still trying to do</text>
  <text start="548.15" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re trying to control everything</text>
  <text start="550.79" dur="6">because they don&amp;#39;t like the alternative</text>
  <text start="554.24" dur="8.13">media out there reporting on things they</text>
  <text start="556.79" dur="8.04">only want one source of information so</text>
  <text start="562.37" dur="4.38">out in Spain we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="564.83" dur="3.45">really heating up right now the Spanish</text>
  <text start="566.75" dur="4.47">government has cracked down on the</text>
  <text start="568.28" dur="5.15">Catalan tsipras separatist and they have</text>
  <text start="571.22" dur="4.95">arrested and jailed two individuals</text>
  <text start="573.43" dur="7">they&amp;#39;re saying that listen this</text>
  <text start="576.17" dur="6.27">referendum is null and void you can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="580.43" dur="5.46">forward with it and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="5.94">Catalonian people the individuals they</text>
  <text start="585.89" dur="4.98">are saying listen you can&amp;#39;t stop us</text>
  <text start="588.38" dur="4.5">we want in independence we are going to</text>
  <text start="590.87" dur="3.48">get it and it looks like the Catalonian</text>
  <text start="592.88" dur="3.21">government and the spanish government</text>
  <text start="594.35" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re starting to butt heads the</text>
  <text start="596.09" dur="6.33">people are going to butt heads and once</text>
  <text start="598.46" dur="5.85">again we might move into some type of</text>
  <text start="602.42" dur="3.6">civil war and we need to watch this</text>
  <text start="604.31" dur="4.41">because we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="606.02" dur="4.95">really heating up in this area we see</text>
  <text start="608.72" dur="4.86">there the propaganda about North Korea</text>
  <text start="610.97" dur="6.42">is continually building right now the</text>
  <text start="613.58" dur="8.25">reporting that North Korea is building a</text>
  <text start="617.39" dur="8.16">new submarine thus impo sea it was</text>
  <text start="621.83" dur="6.27">detected by US intelligence and this</text>
  <text start="625.55" dur="5.7">diesel electric powered submarine will</text>
  <text start="628.1" dur="6.51">be able to sail to the United States and</text>
  <text start="631.25" dur="5.85">launch a ballistic missile now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.61" dur="4.23">saying that North Korea currently has</text>
  <text start="637.1" dur="3.99">one ballistic missile submarine called</text>
  <text start="638.84" dur="5.3">the whale and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="641.09" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re building an even better</text>
  <text start="644.14" dur="4.27">ballistic missile type of sub where</text>
  <text start="646.76" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;ll be able to launch these missiles</text>
  <text start="648.41" dur="4.59">at the United States so they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="649.97" dur="4.38">the idea that North Korea is building</text>
  <text start="653" dur="2.76">these submarines they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="654.35" dur="3.03">sailing it over the United States and</text>
  <text start="655.76" dur="4.26">they can be launching a missile now</text>
  <text start="657.38" dur="6.06">let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second how</text>
  <text start="660.02" dur="8.4">easy would it be for the Cabal to have a</text>
  <text start="663.44" dur="8.55">submarine unmarked launch some type of</text>
  <text start="668.42" dur="5.64">missile at the United States and make it</text>
  <text start="671.99" dur="5.94">look like it came from North Korea or</text>
  <text start="674.06" dur="6.99">have it launched from the submarine near</text>
  <text start="677.93" dur="4.89">South Korea and hit South Korea maybe</text>
  <text start="681.05" dur="3.72">the nuclear weapon doesn&amp;#39;t go off but</text>
  <text start="682.82" dur="3.54">they see some radioactivity because they</text>
  <text start="684.77" dur="4.29">stored that in the missile and they make</text>
  <text start="686.36" dur="4.83">it look like something just happened and</text>
  <text start="689.06" dur="3.66">it looks like this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="691.19" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re building up to and you can see</text>
  <text start="692.72" dur="5.22">that the event meter right now has</text>
  <text start="695.66" dur="4.11">reached Code Red I mean they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="697.94" dur="4.11">about cyberattacks they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="699.77" dur="4.05">the power electric grid they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="3.66">about submarines firing ballistic</text>
  <text start="703.82" dur="3.84">missiles at the United States they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="705.71" dur="3.84">continually keeping this up because</text>
  <text start="707.66" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re preparing and getting ready for</text>
  <text start="709.55" dur="3.99">some type of an event and we can see</text>
  <text start="712.34" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re getting more and more of this</text>
  <text start="713.54" dur="5.16">information and they are building this</text>
  <text start="716.57" dur="4.019">up to make everyone believe that North</text>
  <text start="718.7" dur="3.05">Korea is actually going to be doing this</text>
  <text start="720.589" dur="4.04">now</text>
  <text start="721.75" dur="6.029">in Afghanistan we can see the former</text>
  <text start="724.629" dur="6.57">President Karzai is out there and this</text>
  <text start="727.779" dur="5.761">is Karzai was part of the regime change</text>
  <text start="731.199" dur="4.68">he was part of the puppet government he</text>
  <text start="733.54" dur="5.339">made a lot of money on the pipeline deal</text>
  <text start="735.879" dur="5.341">and he is out there saying listen the</text>
  <text start="738.879" dur="4.921">Islamic state in the in Afghanistan is a</text>
  <text start="741.22" dur="5.7">u.s. tool to cause trouble in the whole</text>
  <text start="743.8" dur="5.61">region and Karzai at the end of his term</text>
  <text start="746.92" dur="5.039">wouldn&amp;#39;t sign the bilateral security</text>
  <text start="749.41" dur="5.099">agreement with the United States to have</text>
  <text start="751.959" dur="4.98">troops stay in Afghanistan this is why</text>
  <text start="754.509" dur="4.741">Obama said we&amp;#39;re removing the troops</text>
  <text start="756.939" dur="4.08">from Afghanistan because that document</text>
  <text start="759.25" dur="4.649">was in sign which actually gave immunity</text>
  <text start="761.019" dur="5.49">to the soldiers in Afghanistan so Obama</text>
  <text start="763.899" dur="4.5">had no choice but to remove the soldiers</text>
  <text start="766.509" dur="3.51">from Afghanistan he wasn&amp;#39;t doing it</text>
  <text start="768.399" dur="3.901">because he&amp;#39;s saying that the war was</text>
  <text start="770.019" dur="5.101">over and we&amp;#39;re removing our troops that</text>
  <text start="772.3" dur="4.529">wasn&amp;#39;t the reason when John Kerry went</text>
  <text start="775.12" dur="3.63">to Afghanistan and helped with the</text>
  <text start="776.829" dur="2.43">elections they got the individual they</text>
  <text start="778.75" dur="2.31">wanted</text>
  <text start="779.259" dur="3.481">he signed the agreement and right after</text>
  <text start="781.06" dur="3.69">the agreement was signed more troops</text>
  <text start="782.74" dur="3.74">started to enter Afghanistan at that</text>
  <text start="784.75" dur="4.35">point but we could see at this point</text>
  <text start="786.48" dur="5.89">people are now coming out saying listen</text>
  <text start="789.1" dur="6">this is what&amp;#39;s really been happening we</text>
  <text start="792.37" dur="6.029">see it in Afghanistan we see it in Syria</text>
  <text start="795.1" dur="4.799">we see in Iraq actually out in Iraq we</text>
  <text start="798.399" dur="4.081">understand that the United States the</text>
  <text start="799.899" dur="5.49">Cabal has been trying to use the Kurd</text>
  <text start="802.48" dur="4.2">area to sell oil and the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="805.389" dur="4.771">government is out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="806.68" dur="6.329">all oil sales must go through the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="810.16" dur="4.619">government Kurds they&amp;#39;re not selling it</text>
  <text start="813.009" dur="4.471">on their own there&amp;#39;s still part of Iraq</text>
  <text start="814.779" dur="4.591">and of course we know why the Cabal</text>
  <text start="817.48" dur="3.81">wanted to do this because Iraq is</text>
  <text start="819.37" dur="3.93">looking to trade outside of the dollar</text>
  <text start="821.29" dur="4.62">sell the oil not using the dollar and</text>
  <text start="823.3" dur="4.889">many countries are doing this we see</text>
  <text start="825.91" dur="4.38">that the Syrian army they are trying to</text>
  <text start="828.189" dur="4.26">take back the Golan height area we see</text>
  <text start="830.29" dur="5.669">Israel now is actually there and</text>
  <text start="832.449" dur="5.61">attacking the Syrian Armed Forces and we</text>
  <text start="835.959" dur="3.841">can see that everything is coming to an</text>
  <text start="838.059" dur="4.83">end in Syria right now the Middle East</text>
  <text start="839.8" dur="5.43">has fallen there&amp;#39;s nothing the Cabal can</text>
  <text start="842.889" dur="5.55">do at this point unless they have some</text>
  <text start="845.23" dur="6.029">type of an event we also see that the</text>
  <text start="848.439" dur="5.58">u.s. is proposing new cyber security</text>
  <text start="851.259" dur="4.291">controls to protect the power grid the</text>
  <text start="854.019" dur="3">Energy Department said in a report</text>
  <text start="855.55" dur="4.38">January that the electricity system</text>
  <text start="857.019" dur="5.311">faces imminent danger from cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="859.93" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re saying a successful hack could</text>
  <text start="862.33" dur="5.67">cause widespread power failures and we</text>
  <text start="865.54" dur="6.9">could see the news is just all over the</text>
  <text start="868" dur="8.1">place with describing how North Korea is</text>
  <text start="872.44" dur="6.03">going to be cyber attacking the power</text>
