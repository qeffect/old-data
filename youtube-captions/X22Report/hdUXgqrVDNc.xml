  <text start="261.53" dur="5.55">buy automobiles and in Cyprus we also</text>
  <text start="264.83" dur="4.589">see that industrial production is down</text>
  <text start="267.08" dur="4.97">by seventeen percent the industrial</text>
  <text start="269.419" dur="4.921">production index recorded at an annual</text>
  <text start="272.05" dur="5.589">drop rate of sixteen point</text>

  <text start="286.04" dur="5.37">year they received their first bailout</text>
  <text start="288.62" dur="4.109">they told us all the officials they came</text>
  <text start="291.41" dur="4.71">out they told us everything is going to</text>
  <text start="292.729" dur="6.031">be fine and it&amp;#39;s taken care of Greece&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="6.78">back on its feet and don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="298.76" dur="6.42">it well here we are and the finance</text>
  <text start="302.9" dur="4.769">minister Wolfie I&amp;#39;ll try to pronounce</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="4.95">his name here shell bull finally</text>
  <text start="307.669" dur="6.091">admitted officially for the first time</text>
  <text start="310.13" dur="6">that Greece will need a third bailout</text>
  <text start="313.76" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ve already blown through 75% of</text>
  <text start="316.13" dur="3.93">their other bailout they laid off all</text>
  <text start="318.26" dur="4.02">the people and they have to lay off</text>
  <text start="320.06" dur="4.98">additional people unemployment is going</text>
  <text start="322.28" dur="4.259">up to thirty percent on among the youths</text>
  <text start="325.04" dur="4.439">they&amp;#39;re getting close I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.539" dur="5.701">around sixty percent and it is just a</text>
  <text start="329.479" dur="4.801">mess over there things are not getting</text>
  <text start="332.24" dur="4.08">better they will need bail out after</text>
  <text start="334.28" dur="4.65">bail out after bailout because they do</text>
  <text start="336.32" dur="7.29">not have the revenue to pay for all the</text>
  <text start="338.93" dur="6.45">interest on all this debt and of course</text>
  <text start="343.61" dur="3.66">the government officials you know</text>
  <text start="345.38" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re all telling you how great it is</text>
  <text start="347.27" dur="5.79">and they go on to say that no I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="350.24" dur="5.22">expect a new haircut for Greece which</text>
  <text start="353.06" dur="5.37">means they will get one we are moving</text>
  <text start="355.46" dur="5.19">ahead step for step there is no question</text>
  <text start="358.43" dur="4.2">that a lot has to change in Greece but</text>
  <text start="360.65" dur="5.07">we also see a clear progress and</text>
  <text start="362.63" dur="5.31">recognize this I mean does anyone see a</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="4.83">clear progress in this they&amp;#39;re on their</text>
  <text start="367.94" dur="4.77">third bailout it&amp;#39;s like having someone</text>
  <text start="370.55" dur="5.369">who&amp;#39;s making fifty thousand dollars a</text>
  <text start="372.71" dur="6.11">year who has five thousand dollars worth</text>
  <text start="375.919" dur="6.361">of debt each month and they&amp;#39;re on their</text>
  <text start="378.82" dur="5.83">27th credit card to pay for all the</text>
  <text start="382.28" dur="6.18">interest on their other credit cards and</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="6.71">eventually the companies will not allow</text>
  <text start="388.46" dur="5.459">them to receive more credit cards and</text>
  <text start="391.36" dur="5.47">that&amp;#39;s when the endgame happens and</text>
  <text start="393.919" dur="5.191">they&amp;#39;re on their third bailout now</text>
  <text start="396.83" dur="7.38">nothing has changed actually it has</text>
  <text start="399.11" dur="8.97">gotten worse now if we move back to the</text>
  <text start="404.21" dur="6.239">US here we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of retail</text>
  <text start="408.08" dur="7.399">store showing that they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="410.449" dur="9.381">well we saw that Walmart sacks</text>

  <text start="424.129" dur="8.85">declined and now we see Barnes and Noble</text>
  <text start="427.4" dur="7.979">they were going to purchase a bookseller</text>
  <text start="432.979" dur="4.5">retail business but Barnes and Nobles</text>
  <text start="435.379" dur="5.19">first quarter net loss more than doubled</text>
  <text start="437.479" dur="7.081">so that part is completely off the table</text>
  <text start="440.569" dur="6.871">now the only bright sign of retail doing</text>
  <text start="444.56" dur="5.579">well is home depot which is up by</text>
  <text start="447.44" dur="6.569">seventeen percent because of the housing</text>
  <text start="450.139" dur="7.951">recovery now this data is from july and</text>
  <text start="454.009" dur="6.96">june and back then the bubble was going</text>

  <text start="460.969" dur="5.281">buying homes and buying gardening things</text>

  <text start="474.949" dur="5.72">sales this will all catch up and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="478.4" dur="7.919">start to see Home Depot reporting</text>
  <text start="480.669" dur="10.331">sluggish sales slower sales because we</text>
  <text start="486.319" dur="8.13">have seen that um mortgage companies</text>
  <text start="491" dur="6.99">have been laying off people now if the</text>
  <text start="494.449" dur="6.72">housing boom is so fantastic and the</text>
  <text start="497.99" dur="5.669">housing market is so incredible when</text>

  <text start="548.36" dur="6.39">then sold them off to other mortgage</text>
  <text start="552.44" dur="4.74">companies but we&amp;#39;re seeing this trend</text>
  <text start="554.75" dur="4.62">all over the place and there&amp;#39;s always a</text>

  <text start="583.7" dur="5.28">really look deeply into it it is not</text>
  <text start="586.73" dur="5.01">doing better and this is the same thing</text>
  <text start="588.98" dur="4.729">that we saw a prior to 2008 everyone</text>
  <text start="591.74" dur="4.349">thought that housing could never go down</text>
  <text start="593.709" dur="4.121">they were if you were just looking</text>

  <text start="602.69" dur="6.18">know trade up keep flipping all those</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="5.1">people and I know a lot of them who lost</text>
  <text start="608.87" dur="5.219">a lot of money doing this because they</text>
  <text start="611.9" dur="4.26">didn&amp;#39;t see the real signs they listened</text>
  <text start="614.089" dur="6.531">to the government and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="616.16" dur="8.25">media now it&amp;#39;s being reported that</text>

  <text start="634.16" dur="5.19">that show the job market may have lost</text>
  <text start="636.14" dur="6.36">some momentum here and of course you</text>
  <text start="639.35" dur="6.27">know if you&amp;#39;re using the government&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1034.23" dur="5.229">the aid to the military is very</text>

  <text start="1075.01" dur="6.93">and what I&amp;#39;m seeing here is that</text>
  <text start="1078.64" dur="5.01">Congress would like to stop the aid</text>

  <text start="1096.1" dur="9.69">way to allow the military to continually</text>
  <text start="1101.2" dur="8.34">receive aid because what is interesting</text>
  <text start="1105.79" dur="7.37">about this is that they already knew</text>
  <text start="1109.54" dur="10.86">this was coming up because we had that</text>
  <text start="1113.16" dur="10.63">report about the Saudi the Saudi foreign</text>

  <text start="1141.16" dur="9.21">also we&amp;#39;re seeing that Mubarak is</text>
  <text start="1146.97" dur="6.82">getting released at the same time that</text>
  <text start="1150.37" dur="7.53">this is happening so will they stop the</text>
  <text start="1153.79" dur="6.27">aid in Egypt I do not believe they will</text>
  <text start="1157.9" dur="4.53">just like our troops are never going to</text>

  <text start="1176.5" dur="4.2">and stop the aid there and give up</text>
  <text start="1179.14" dur="4.17">everything there they&amp;#39;ll always find a</text>
  <text start="1180.7" dur="4.05">way to get around it and we can see the</text>

  <text start="1184.75" dur="8.13">it&amp;#39;s through Saudi Arabia now Obamacare</text>

  <text start="1220.69" dur="3.93">who choose not to set up their own</text>

  <text start="1272.919" dur="6.301">this would have left Obamacare in</text>

  <text start="1279.22" dur="5.339">well just like he&amp;#39;s done many other</text>
  <text start="1281.799" dur="6.6">times he decided let&amp;#39;s bypass some laws</text>
