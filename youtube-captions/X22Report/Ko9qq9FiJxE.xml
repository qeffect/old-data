  <text start="187.549" dur="5.58">estate and we know at this point in time</text>
  <text start="190.639" dur="4.171">that the Bilderberger group they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="193.129" dur="4.621">having their meeting in Germany this</text>
  <text start="194.81" dur="4.319">week and we know what they&amp;#39;re discussing</text>
  <text start="197.75" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re discussing a one-world</text>
  <text start="199.129" dur="4.741">government they&amp;#39;re discussing this</text>
  <text start="201.23" dur="5.159">economic collapse how can we control the</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="6.63">people how can we keep the people from</text>
  <text start="206.389" dur="5.55">using free speech and one of the things</text>
  <text start="210.5" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re talking about is a virtual</text>
  <text start="211.939" dur="9.121">passport that web users would need to</text>
  <text start="215.48" dur="9">use to obtain internet and there would</text>
  <text start="221.06" dur="5.489">be an internet ID and they would be able</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="3.75">to track you they&amp;#39;d be able to see what</text>
  <text start="226.549" dur="3.68">you&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;d be able to block</text>
  <text start="228.23" dur="4.259">you whenever they needed to do so</text>
  <text start="230.229" dur="6.1">they&amp;#39;re talking about a global tax</text>
  <text start="232.489" dur="6.18">system which the UN would control in the</text>
  <text start="236.329" dur="6.66">very end here and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="238.669" dur="5.85">point their mission at this point is to</text>
  <text start="242.989" dur="4.89">have a one-world government this is</text>
  <text start="244.519" dur="6.3">their main goal and of course what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="247.879" dur="4.44">seeing right now is countries even</text>
  <text start="250.819" dur="2.971">though they have the central bank</text>
  <text start="252.319" dur="4.26">intertwined with them they&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="5.819">against this we see out in Europe that</text>
  <text start="256.579" dur="5.041">what is going on there is where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="259.609" dur="4.921">trying to have this open free border and</text>
  <text start="261.62" dur="4.68">try trying to have the refugees move</text>
  <text start="264.53" dur="3.78">into these areas the countries are</text>
  <text start="266.3" dur="4.38">fighting back and saying no no no we do</text>
  <text start="268.31" dur="5.55">not want this we don&amp;#39;t want this open</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="4.83">free border system we want to control it</text>
  <text start="273.86" dur="3.57">we don&amp;#39;t want our sovereignty taken away</text>
  <text start="275.51" dur="3.81">but we can see at this point this is</text>
  <text start="277.43" dur="5.79">what the one world government is all</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="7.95">about is creating everything to be as</text>
  <text start="283.22" dur="6.09">one and we can see at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="287.27" dur="5.61">going to continue on pushing this goal</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="6.359">but eventually countries will fight back</text>
  <text start="292.88" dur="4.5">the people will fight back and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.669" dur="2.611">going to be a very difficult thing to do</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="4.97">so what they do is they</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="7.8">take very small steps they take very</text>
  <text start="302.35" dur="5.92">small steps convincing people thinking</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="3.93">that this is the right thing to do they</text>
  <text start="308.27" dur="4.41">did this in Europe but it is backfiring</text>
  <text start="310.01" dur="4.92">right now out in Germany we see the</text>
  <text start="312.68" dur="4.32">German people are saying okay we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="314.93" dur="5.1">enough demonstrators they for anna</text>
  <text start="317" dur="4.68">formed a human chain near the US air</text>
  <text start="320.03" dur="4.31">base in western Germany to protest</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="7.59">against the lethal drone strikes and</text>
  <text start="324.34" dur="7.21">they were blocking everything we see the</text>
  <text start="329.27" dur="5.64">u.s. now is deploying more military</text>
  <text start="331.55" dur="4.74">assets around the world as we know we</text>
  <text start="334.91" dur="3.15">have aircraft carriers in the</text>
  <text start="336.29" dur="3.74">Mediterranean we know the harry s truman</text>
  <text start="338.06" dur="5.34">is there we know the dwight d eisenhower</text>
  <text start="340.03" dur="6.46">is there we know out in the Pacific the</text>
  <text start="343.4" dur="5.07">jonsi Stennis that strike group is</text>
  <text start="346.49" dur="4.41">continuing their operations near the</text>
  <text start="348.47" dur="5.25">South China Sea and we know that the</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="5.76">Ronald Reagan that has departed for</text>
  <text start="353.72" dur="5.52">Japan and of course this aircraft</text>
  <text start="356.66" dur="6.56">carrier strike group was going to join</text>
  <text start="359.24" dur="8.69">the jhansi Stennis and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="363.22" dur="8.199">keep peace and stability in the region</text>
  <text start="367.93" dur="8.56">well this is one of the first times in a</text>
  <text start="371.419" dur="7.201">very long time where we&amp;#39;ve had the u.s.</text>
  <text start="376.49" dur="5.22">deploy aircraft carrier Strike groups at</text>
  <text start="378.62" dur="6.299">the same time in two different areas</text>
  <text start="381.71" dur="5.4">conducting drills at the same time so we</text>
  <text start="384.919" dur="4.831">have them in the Mediterranean and we</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="7.23">have it out in the Pacific very</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="6.68">interesting we see Iran Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="394.34" dur="4.199">they had a meeting back on jun 9th and</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="4">they have agreed to step up cooperation</text>
  <text start="398.539" dur="6.051">in the fight against terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="400.43" dur="6.78">and any country or any group that</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="6.94">sponsors terrorist groups they will be</text>
  <text start="407.21" dur="5.459">going after them now we understand that</text>
  <text start="411.53" dur="4.83">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="412.669" dur="5.731">bankers they are building a base to base</text>
  <text start="416.36" dur="4.59">is actually in Syria we understand that</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="5.73">Germany is upgrading a base in Turkey</text>
  <text start="420.95" dur="5.31">and then we get word that France is</text>
  <text start="424.13" dur="5.099">building building a military base in</text>
  <text start="426.26" dur="5.149">Syria and this is near the city of</text>
  <text start="429.229" dur="4.4">kobane</text>
  <text start="431.409" dur="4.44">and we see right now that the French</text>
  <text start="433.629" dur="3.81">special operation forces deployed in no</text>
  <text start="435.849" dur="5.52">serious started the construction of the</text>
  <text start="437.439" dur="6.15">military base and they are doing the</text>
  <text start="441.369" dur="4.41">same thing that the US is doing where</text>
  <text start="443.589" dur="4.59">they can bring in huge transports bring</text>
  <text start="445.779" dur="4.62">in military assets bring in troops to</text>
  <text start="448.179" dur="5.94">this area so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="450.399" dur="5.401">in Syria is we see the US has special op</text>
  <text start="454.119" dur="4.08">teams the UK has special ops teams</text>
  <text start="455.8" dur="4.139">France has special op team&amp;#39;s most likely</text>
  <text start="458.199" dur="3.631">as many other countries already in there</text>
  <text start="459.939" dur="3.99">with their teams because we know that</text>
  <text start="461.83" dur="3.959">the United States Ashton Carter went all</text>
  <text start="463.929" dur="3.75">around to the European countries to the</text>
  <text start="465.789" dur="4.261">coalition forces saying listen we need</text>
  <text start="467.679" dur="5.49">more military assets we need troops we</text>
  <text start="470.05" dur="6.119">need to build this up we need to create</text>
  <text start="473.169" dur="5.79">these zones and with the military bases</text>
  <text start="476.169" dur="5.04">that the French are building that the</text>
  <text start="478.959" dur="6.75">u.s. is building it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.209" dur="8.04">moving towards this direction now over</text>
  <text start="485.709" dur="6">this weekend we had a mass shooting and</text>
  <text start="489.249" dur="5.85">I wanted to talk about this and the</text>
  <text start="491.709" dur="7.41">anomalies that we have seen in the</text>
  <text start="495.099" dur="6.54">shooting now officials announced at</text>
  <text start="499.119" dur="6.06">ten-fifteen am in a news conference that</text>
  <text start="501.639" dur="9.87">the number of dead that is risen to 50</text>
  <text start="505.179" dur="9.33">and what has happened here is that in a</text>
  <text start="511.509" dur="7.26">club in orlando called post orlando</text>
  <text start="514.509" dur="8.421">pulse an LGBTQ club just south of</text>
  <text start="518.769" dur="8.01">downtown there was a man that walked in</text>
  <text start="522.93" dur="7.209">it was a hostage situation a SWAT team</text>
  <text start="526.779" dur="6.961">was called in and there was gunfire all</text>
  <text start="530.139" dur="6.51">over the place and of course the shooter</text>
  <text start="533.74" dur="6.719">ended up dead so the question is who is</text>
  <text start="536.649" dur="8.61">this shooter his name is Omar near Sadiq</text>
  <text start="540.459" dur="8.94">mateen and he was born on November 16th</text>
  <text start="545.259" dur="8.31">1986 he lived in Fort Pierce in st.</text>
  <text start="549.399" dur="9.091">Louis County Florida he is a registered</text>
  <text start="553.569" dur="8.37">to vote he&amp;#39;s a Democrat and his race is</text>
  <text start="558.49" dur="6">listed as other now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="561.939" dur="3.511">interesting about this is that the FBI</text>
  <text start="564.49" dur="5.01">knew of</text>
  <text start="565.45" dur="6.33">and most likely was in contact with him</text>
  <text start="569.5" dur="5.67">which we&amp;#39;ve seen many many times before</text>
  <text start="571.78" dur="7.71">in other shootings which turned out to</text>
  <text start="575.17" dur="5.85">be complete false flags now Obama was</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="4.17">out there giving a speech and of course</text>
  <text start="581.02" dur="4.8">he touched upon gun control but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="583.66" dur="4.14">get to that little bit later and he</text>
  <text start="585.82" dur="3.63">wanted the FBI to look into this most</text>
  <text start="587.8" dur="11.94">likely to cover a lot of this stuff up</text>
  <text start="589.45" dur="13.89">and we see that Omar he is reportedly</text>
  <text start="599.74" dur="9.45">pledging his allegiance to the Islamic</text>
  <text start="603.34" dur="10.56">state because NBC reported that before</text>
  <text start="609.19" dur="7.62">the shooting he called 911 to pledge</text>
  <text start="613.9" dur="8.46">allegiance to the Islamic state does</text>
  <text start="616.81" dur="7.53">that make any sense whatsoever that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="622.36" dur="4.65">going to place a call pledge allegiance</text>
  <text start="624.34" dur="7.11">to the Islamic state and then go into</text>
  <text start="627.01" dur="7.02">the club that seems a little far-fetched</text>
  <text start="631.45" dur="4.62">there but this is how propaganda works</text>
  <text start="634.03" dur="4.83">and of course people like to run with</text>
  <text start="636.07" dur="6.06">this and then we have the ex-wife come</text>
  <text start="638.86" dur="8.7">out saying that he was violent mentally</text>
  <text start="642.13" dur="7.83">unstable beat her and the ex-wife said</text>
  <text start="647.56" dur="4.86">she met Oh more online about eight years</text>
  <text start="649.96" dur="5.25">ago decided to move to Florida and marry</text>
  <text start="652.42" dur="6.42">him and she said the marriage felt</text>
  <text start="655.21" dur="5.76">normal and then it became abusive well</text>
  <text start="658.84" dur="4.32">they needed this story in there to show</text>
  <text start="660.97" dur="8.31">this is why he would go and flip out and</text>
  <text start="663.16" dur="8.64">shoot people now Isis they are claiming</text>
  <text start="669.28" dur="3.57">responsibility for the shooting that he</text>
  <text start="671.8" dur="4.95">was one of the Islamic state fighters</text>
  <text start="672.85" dur="5.55">and we see that the Syrian news agency</text>
  <text start="676.75" dur="4.02">which has close ties to the islamic</text>
  <text start="678.4" dur="5.43">state says that the group is responsible</text>
  <text start="680.77" dur="6.63">for the attack on the orlando gay club</text>
  <text start="683.83" dur="6.09">which killed 50 people left about 53</text>
  <text start="687.4" dur="6.63">injured allegedly because we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="689.92" dur="7.17">the exact facts of what happened there</text>
  <text start="694.03" dur="6.48">and there are certain anomalies to this</text>
  <text start="697.09" dur="5.76">entire story here first of all if you do</text>
  <text start="700.51" dur="7.32">a search on Google there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="702.85" dur="6.39">people who reported to shooters and it</text>
  <text start="707.83" dur="3.98">comes up in the search but when you</text>
  <text start="709.24" dur="7.35">click on the stories those seem to be</text>
  <text start="711.81" dur="8.32">disappearing very very quickly the other</text>
  <text start="716.59" dur="7.46">thing is Oh more he was a gun owner he</text>
  <text start="720.13" dur="7.59">was a statewide Firearms licensed and</text>
  <text start="724.05" dur="7.42">very interestingly the night club was a</text>
  <text start="727.72" dur="7.68">gun-free zone because in Florida where</text>
  <text start="731.47" dur="9.48">you serve alcohol those areas are gun</text>
  <text start="735.4" dur="8.12">free now other strange anomalies is that</text>
  <text start="740.95" dur="5.27">first of all he has pictures on myspace</text>
  <text start="743.52" dur="5.14">do you ever notice that all of these</text>
  <text start="746.22" dur="6.46">shooters and all these type of false</text>
  <text start="748.66" dur="7.73">flags they always use myspace most of</text>
  <text start="752.68" dur="9.45">the time well he took pictures of</text>
  <text start="756.39" dur="7.96">himself wearing NYPD shirts which is</text>
  <text start="762.13" dur="5.46">strange in itself but then you start to</text>
  <text start="764.35" dur="6.66">realize that he was in security he was a</text>
  <text start="767.59" dur="7.35">notary at one time maybe he wanted to go</text>
  <text start="771.01" dur="7.5">into law enforcement and the FBI was in</text>
  <text start="774.94" dur="5.22">some type of contact with him so when we</text>
  <text start="778.51" dur="4.77">start to put a lot of these pieces</text>
  <text start="780.16" dur="7.5">together he was in security he was a</text>
  <text start="783.28" dur="6.99">licensed firearm owner he liked law</text>
  <text start="787.66" dur="6.36">enforcement he liked to show himself</text>
  <text start="790.27" dur="6.24">wearing an NYPD shirt even though the</text>
  <text start="794.02" dur="4.59">NYPD is saying he had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="796.51" dur="4.5">you know their organization whatsoever</text>
  <text start="798.61" dur="4.98">and we&amp;#39;re starting to getting the</text>
  <text start="801.01" dur="4.05">picture that maybe he wanted to go into</text>
  <text start="803.59" dur="3.96">law enforcement and most of the guys</text>
  <text start="805.06" dur="4.71">that are in security would like to take</text>
  <text start="807.55" dur="4.28">that next step but many of them can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="809.77" dur="8.64">make it in or something happens and</text>
  <text start="811.83" dur="8.77">maybe the CIA FBI or any other agency or</text>
  <text start="818.41" dur="4.5">governmental group approached him and</text>
  <text start="820.6" dur="4.4">said listen we know that you&amp;#39;re into</text>
  <text start="822.91" dur="5.01">security we know you&amp;#39;re into the agency</text>
  <text start="825" dur="5.889">into a joining law enforcement agency</text>
  <text start="827.92" dur="5.82">this might be your chance we need you to</text>
  <text start="830.889" dur="5.311">help out with this drill that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="833.74" dur="4.94">creating we&amp;#39;re going to have to have you</text>
  <text start="836.2" dur="4.5">with your handgun and a shotgun and</text>
  <text start="838.68" dur="4.51">we&amp;#39;re going to need you to go into the</text>
  <text start="840.7" dur="4.23">club and a lot of people are in on it so</text>
  <text start="843.19" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t worry about it they might have put</text>
  <text start="844.93" dur="5.099">blanks into his gun we don&amp;#39;t know and we</text>
  <text start="847.87" dur="5.37">need you to start shooting now a handgun</text>
  <text start="850.029" dur="5.791">and the rifle that he had can he shoot</text>
  <text start="853.24" dur="6.74">that many people at once that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="855.82" dur="6.92">very difficult but then we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="859.98" dur="6.25">stories about the second shooter</text>
  <text start="862.74" dur="5.2">actually people on video saying that</text>
  <text start="866.23" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;ve heard multiple shots coming from</text>
  <text start="867.94" dur="7.53">many different areas not just one now</text>
  <text start="872.26" dur="6.54">the father came out very quickly and</text>
  <text start="875.47" dur="6.299">said that this was not because of</text>
  <text start="878.8" dur="7.32">religion and he said the motive for the</text>
  <text start="881.769" dur="7.111">attack was because he saw two men</text>
  <text start="886.12" dur="6.06">kissing in public in front of his</text>
  <text start="888.88" dur="5.73">three-year-old son okay so this is why</text>
  <text start="892.18" dur="7.08">you would go in and kill everyone which</text>
  <text start="894.61" dur="7.14">he has no criminal background he has no</text>
  <text start="899.26" dur="5.28">incidents whatsoever of anything like</text>
  <text start="901.75" dur="5.399">that and he was in security may be</text>
  <text start="904.54" dur="3.75">looking to get into law enforcement so</text>
  <text start="907.149" dur="4.711">this really doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="908.29" dur="7.56">whatsoever he wasn&amp;#39;t on any terror watch</text>
  <text start="911.86" dur="8.7">list and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="915.85" dur="7.349">that the establishment the corporate</text>
  <text start="920.56" dur="4.74">media the president they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="923.199" dur="3.89">about terror that it was an act of</text>
  <text start="925.3" dur="4.649">terror is an act this is a domestic</text>
  <text start="927.089" dur="5.891">terror Islamic state is out there</text>
  <text start="929.949" dur="5.521">claiming responsibility we have NBC</text>
  <text start="932.98" dur="5.039">saying yes he phoned in before he went</text>
  <text start="935.47" dur="5.309">off on the attack I haven&amp;#39;t seen that</text>
  <text start="938.019" dur="4.081">much footage inside a lot of people</text>
  <text start="940.779" dur="2.641">dancing in there a lot of people going</text>
  <text start="942.1" dur="3">on you think a lot of people had phones</text>
  <text start="943.42" dur="4.859">you think a lot of people will be taking</text>
  <text start="945.1" dur="4.38">videos at this point but the videos that</text>
  <text start="948.279" dur="4.021">I want to look at they&amp;#39;re being taken</text>
  <text start="949.48" dur="5.58">down very very rapidly so you really</text>
  <text start="952.3" dur="5.07">can&amp;#39;t see that much and when we look at</text>
  <text start="955.06" dur="5.19">these steps that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="957.37" dur="5">we start to draw a picture that this</text>
  <text start="960.25" dur="4.709">fits into a false flag</text>
  <text start="962.37" dur="6.069">and now we have to remember it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="964.959" dur="7.11">mean that people don&amp;#39;t die in a false</text>
  <text start="968.439" dur="6.81">flag a hoax and a false flag two</text>
  <text start="972.069" dur="6.18">different things but let&amp;#39;s go with the</text>
  <text start="975.249" dur="4.111">story of what the government is telling</text>
  <text start="978.249" dur="3.21">us what the corporate media is telling</text>
  <text start="979.36" dur="4.949">us and they&amp;#39;re telling us that it is the</text>
  <text start="981.459" dur="6.781">Islamic state that it is an act of</text>
  <text start="984.309" dur="5.76">terror that he was part of Isis well we</text>
  <text start="988.24" dur="4.05">have people out there calling for gun</text>
  <text start="990.069" dur="4.981">control this is the worst ever and we</text>
  <text start="992.29" dur="4.68">known Obama wants to get that</text>
  <text start="995.05" dur="4.019">legislation pushed through we know the</text>
  <text start="996.97" dur="4.409">Dianne Feinstein bill is there we know</text>
  <text start="999.069" dur="5.161">his gun legislation bill is there we</text>
  <text start="1001.379" dur="4.981">know that he supports we know that many</text>
  <text start="1004.23" dur="4.169">others are in their pending in Congress</text>
  <text start="1006.36" dur="3.779">and if you notice every once in a while</text>
  <text start="1008.399" dur="4.471">they need a little push because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1010.139" dur="5.791">no traction with them whatsoever now of</text>
  <text start="1012.87" dur="4.8">course they added in a little mix into</text>
  <text start="1015.93" dur="6.569">this where it was done in a gay</text>
  <text start="1017.67" dur="6.48">nightclub trying to get everyone in the</text>
  <text start="1022.499" dur="3.33">same direction of saying okay enough&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1024.15" dur="4.889">enough but if they&amp;#39;re going with the</text>
  <text start="1025.829" dur="5.82">story that this was terror would it not</text>
  <text start="1029.039" dur="5.581">be wise to have everyone armed in the</text>
  <text start="1031.649" dur="6">gay club to fight against these</text>
  <text start="1034.62" dur="5.37">terrorists now I&amp;#39;m not saying it was</text>
  <text start="1037.649" dur="4.321">terrorism or wasn&amp;#39;t terrorism but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1039.99" dur="6.29">going with what they&amp;#39;re trying to tell</text>
  <text start="1041.97" dur="6.689">us if terrorists are in our country if</text>
  <text start="1046.28" dur="5.769">terrorists are going to be shooting up</text>
  <text start="1048.659" dur="4.831">people in clubs and movie theaters in</text>
  <text start="1052.049" dur="4.951">different places shouldn&amp;#39;t we all be</text>
  <text start="1053.49" dur="4.919">armed to protect ourselves now if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1057" dur="4.409">going with the other end that he was</text>
  <text start="1058.409" dur="4.65">just a crane a crazy loon who was out</text>
  <text start="1061.409" dur="3.451">there because he didn&amp;#39;t like the gay</text>
  <text start="1063.059" dur="6.211">population and I just wanted to shoot up</text>
  <text start="1064.86" dur="7.199">people well shouldn&amp;#39;t we not have</text>
  <text start="1069.27" dur="4.23">gun-free zones in these type of</text>
  <text start="1072.059" dur="4.461">establishments maybe people need to</text>
  <text start="1073.5" dur="6.72">protect themselves against these people</text>
  <text start="1076.52" dur="5.8">now of course as we can see we need more</text>
  <text start="1080.22" dur="3.929">information but there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="1082.32" dur="3.719">anomalies a lot of things being taken</text>

  <text start="1086.039" dur="6.571">reporting two gunmen and a lot of this</text>
