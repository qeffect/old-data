  <text start="107.99" dur="3.51">United States used to be called the g8</text>
  <text start="109.64" dur="3.66">because Russia was included now they</text>
  <text start="111.5" dur="5.06">don&amp;#39;t include Russia but it looks like</text>
  <text start="113.3" dur="5.849">the g6 +1 meeting has not gone well</text>
  <text start="116.56" dur="7.54">whatsoever it looks like Trump has</text>
  <text start="119.149" dur="6.931">lashed out at Trudeau and basically he</text>
  <text start="124.1" dur="5.1">went on to say that he will not endorse</text>
  <text start="126.08" dur="5.22">the final g7 communique and we&amp;#39;ll look</text>
  <text start="129.2" dur="4.68">to impose tariffs on cars potentially</text>
  <text start="131.3" dur="5.7">signaling a worsening of relations and a</text>
  <text start="133.88" dur="5.07">brewing trade war Justin Trudeau earlier</text>
  <text start="137" dur="4.32">said that his country will move ahead</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="5.07">with retaliatory measures against the</text>
  <text start="141.32" dur="5.01">recently imposed US tariffs on allies</text>
  <text start="144.02" dur="4.86">steel aluminum exports he said the new</text>
  <text start="146.33" dur="4.65">tires on Canada were insulting and said</text>
  <text start="148.88" dur="4.08">he told Trump directly that Canadians</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="3.99">particularly did not take lightly the</text>
  <text start="152.96" dur="4.77">fact that it&amp;#39;s based on national</text>
  <text start="154.97" dur="4.5">security reasons and held firm to the</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="3.78">government&amp;#39;s threat of retaliation</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="4.02">he said Canadians are polite or</text>
  <text start="161.51" dur="5.7">reasonable but we will also not be</text>
  <text start="163.49" dur="5.79">pushed around now Trump was angered by</text>
  <text start="167.21" dur="5.24">Trudeau&amp;#39;s apparent two-faced comment and</text>
  <text start="169.28" dur="7.05">he basically said listen this is about</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="6.34">Canada charging about 270 percent</text>
  <text start="176.33" dur="5.01">Andheri this is has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="178.79" dur="5.79">that and the other part of it is the</text>
  <text start="181.34" dur="5">communique that all of you are putting</text>
  <text start="184.58" dur="4.79">out there there is a problem with</text>
  <text start="186.34" dur="6.479">let&amp;#39;s look at the g7 communicating the</text>
  <text start="189.37" dur="6.089">demands for Russia and Syria and Ukraine</text>
  <text start="192.819" dur="6.061">because this is all part of the deep</text>
  <text start="195.459" dur="4.591">state this is all these leaders together</text>
  <text start="198.88" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re still part of the same system</text>
  <text start="200.05" dur="5.1">and they&amp;#39;re still pushing the same</text>
  <text start="202.27" dur="5.4">propaganda agenda now they put together</text>
  <text start="205.15" dur="5.64">the communique and this is section 13</text>
  <text start="207.67" dur="6.569">and 14 and it says the following we urge</text>
  <text start="210.79" dur="6.51">Russia to cease its destabilizing</text>
  <text start="214.239" dur="5.161">behavior to undermine them democratic</text>
  <text start="217.3" dur="4.92">systems and its support of the Syrian</text>
  <text start="219.4" dur="5.669">regime we condemn the attack using</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="5.43">military-grade nerve agent in Salas</text>
  <text start="225.069" dur="5.041">Barre United Kingdom well first of all</text>
  <text start="227.65" dur="4.649">that was never proven they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="230.11" dur="3.39">shown any evidence and they still have</text>
  <text start="232.299" dur="4.02">nothing but they&amp;#39;re just blaming it on</text>
  <text start="233.5" dur="4.47">Russia that is with the scribbles we</text>
  <text start="236.319" dur="3.661">share and agree with the United</text>
  <text start="237.97" dur="3.96">Kingdom&amp;#39;s assessment that it is highly</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="3.81">likely that the Russian Federation was</text>
  <text start="241.93" dur="3.839">responsible for the attack and that</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="3.809">there is no plausible alternative</text>
  <text start="245.769" dur="6.06">explanation there&amp;#39;s no other explanation</text>
  <text start="247.599" dur="7.321">on how this happened because if it was</text>
  <text start="251.829" dur="4.951">nova chuck these people would be dead we</text>
  <text start="254.92" dur="4.319">urge Russia to live up to its</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="4.32">international obligations as well as its</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="3.901">responsibilities as a permanent member</text>
  <text start="261.1" dur="3.95">of the UN Security Council to uphold</text>
  <text start="263.14" dur="4.74">international peace and security</text>
  <text start="265.05" dur="4.48">notwithstanding we will continue to</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="3.63">engage with Russia on addressing</text>
  <text start="269.53" dur="4.609">regional crisis and global challenges</text>
  <text start="271.51" dur="6.09">where it is our interests we we</text>
  <text start="274.139" dur="5.711">reiterate our condemnation of the</text>
  <text start="277.6" dur="5.039">illegal annexation of Crimea and</text>
  <text start="279.85" dur="5.34">reaffirm our enduring support for</text>
  <text start="282.639" dur="4.381">Ukrainian sovereignty independence and</text>
  <text start="285.19" dur="4.08">territorial integrity within its</text>
  <text start="287.02" dur="4.5">internationally recognized borders we</text>
  <text start="289.27" dur="4.649">maintain our commitment to assisting</text>
  <text start="291.52" dur="4.83">Ukraine in implementing its ambitious</text>
  <text start="293.919" dur="3.931">and necessary reform agenda we recall</text>
  <text start="296.35" dur="3.81">that continuation of sanctions is</text>
  <text start="297.85" dur="4.56">clearly linked to Russia&amp;#39;s failure to</text>
  <text start="300.16" dur="4.14">demonstrate complete implementation of</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="3.27">its commitments in the Minsk agreement</text>
  <text start="304.3" dur="3.57">which is actually the opposite Ukraine</text>
  <text start="305.68" dur="3.63">is not agreeing with the let&amp;#39;s see-oh</text>
  <text start="307.87" dur="4.2">the agreement that Russia put together</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="6.479">and Ukraine hasn&amp;#39;t lived up to their</text>
  <text start="312.07" dur="5.849">part we also know that under the Obama</text>
  <text start="315.789" dur="4.74">administration and this is why Trump is</text>
  <text start="317.919" dur="6.18">tweeting something about Obama with</text>
  <text start="320.529" dur="5.49">he says under Obama he let Crimea be</text>
  <text start="324.099" dur="5.33">taken away by Russia so now he&amp;#39;s blaming</text>
  <text start="326.019" dur="6.72">this on Obama and again this is about</text>
  <text start="329.429" dur="5.47">Russia not conforming to the deep state</text>
  <text start="332.739" dur="4.94">not conforming to the central bank and</text>
  <text start="334.899" dur="7.74">they&amp;#39;re still pushing the same exact</text>
  <text start="337.679" dur="7.24">propaganda section 14 in Syria we also</text>
  <text start="342.639" dur="4.5">condemned the repeated and morally</text>
  <text start="344.919" dur="4.23">reprehensible use of chemical weapons by</text>
  <text start="347.139" dur="3.72">the Syrian regime and by the Islamic</text>
  <text start="349.149" dur="2.85">state well it&amp;#39;s funny how they put in</text>
  <text start="350.859" dur="3.39">the Islamic state because they know the</text>
  <text start="351.999" dur="4.88">Islamic state is beaten but they put in</text>
  <text start="354.249" dur="5.79">Syria and again it has never been proven</text>
  <text start="356.879" dur="7.03">it has never been proven that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="360.039" dur="6.68">government used chemical weapons we have</text>
  <text start="363.909" dur="5.58">evidence that these are false flags and</text>
  <text start="366.719" dur="5.32">once again they found a lot of sarin gas</text>
  <text start="369.489" dur="6.29">sarin gas in the moderate rebel caves</text>
  <text start="372.039" dur="6.75">they found chlorine and sarin gas</text>
  <text start="375.779" dur="4.69">manufacturing plants in the Islamic</text>
  <text start="378.789" dur="3.81">state areas which were overrun by the</text>
  <text start="380.469" dur="3.99">Syrian army and they found all the</text>
  <text start="382.599" dur="3.54">weapons and all the manufacturing plants</text>
  <text start="384.459" dur="4.26">and all the containers and things like</text>
  <text start="386.139" dur="4.26">that so again there is evidence out</text>
  <text start="388.719" dur="4.38">there but these government&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="390.399" dur="5.07">sticking to the deep state plan they</text>
  <text start="393.099" dur="5.52">they didn&amp;#39;t even veer off they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="395.469" dur="5.7">doing what they&amp;#39;ve done in the past let</text>
  <text start="398.619" dur="4.92">me continue now with the communique we</text>
  <text start="401.169" dur="4.23">deplore the fact that Syria assumed the</text>
  <text start="403.539" dur="5.27">presidency of the conference on</text>
  <text start="405.399" dur="5.76">Disarmament in May now every country</text>
  <text start="408.809" dur="5.41">gets a chance they go by alphabetical</text>
  <text start="411.159" dur="4.47">order and it&amp;#39;s serious term so basically</text>
  <text start="414.219" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s their turn to do this and they</text>
  <text start="415.629" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t like this and they went on to say</text>
  <text start="418.179" dur="4.17">given its consistent and flagrant</text>
  <text start="420.489" dur="4.26">disregard of international</text>
  <text start="422.349" dur="5.1">non-proliferation norms and agreements</text>
  <text start="424.749" dur="4.89">we reaffirm our collective commitment to</text>
  <text start="427.449" dur="4.38">the Chemical Weapons Convention and call</text>
  <text start="429.639" dur="3.54">on all states to support the upcoming</text>
  <text start="431.829" dur="2.97">organization for the prohibition of</text>
  <text start="433.179" dur="4.11">chemical weapons special conference of</text>
  <text start="434.799" dur="4.89">States Parties and to work together to</text>
  <text start="437.289" dur="3.99">strengthen the ability of the OPCW to</text>
  <text start="439.689" dur="4.41">promote the implementation of the</text>
  <text start="441.279" dur="5.19">convention we call upon those who have</text>
  <text start="444.099" dur="4.65">yet to do so to join the international</text>
  <text start="446.469" dur="4.77">partnership against impunity for the use</text>
  <text start="448.749" dur="4.591">of chemical weapons we call for credible</text>
  <text start="451.239" dur="5.281">inclusive and not an</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="5.76">secretary governance in Syria means they</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t want Assad to be the president</text>
  <text start="459.1" dur="5.22">there because they wanted to say that</text>
  <text start="461.44" dur="4.71">they want free and fair elections there</text>
  <text start="464.32" dur="3.21">what they&amp;#39;re really saying is they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="466.15" dur="3.78">want that to happen because they know</text>
  <text start="467.53" dur="5.31">the people are going to vote for Assad</text>
  <text start="469.93" dur="6">let me say he brought in Russia he</text>
  <text start="472.84" dur="4.889">brought in Iran they destroyed the</text>
  <text start="475.93" dur="4.29">Islamic state they liberated the towns</text>
  <text start="477.729" dur="3.331">the villages the refugees are flowing</text>
  <text start="480.22" dur="3.72">back into Syria</text>
  <text start="481.06" dur="5.49">why wouldn&amp;#39;t they vote for him if he was</text>
  <text start="483.94" dur="5.22">actually killing everyone in Syria</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="6.6">why would millions of people return it</text>
  <text start="489.16" dur="5.97">makes no sense and once again here is</text>
  <text start="493.15" dur="4.11">the deep State so what do we have we</text>
  <text start="495.13" dur="4.05">have the deep state on one side and we</text>
  <text start="497.26" dur="5.82">have Trump and those behind him on the</text>
  <text start="499.18" dur="5.97">other side and they are coming to a head</text>
  <text start="503.08" dur="5.04">the battle right now is right in front</text>
  <text start="505.15" dur="4.8">of us it&amp;#39;s going head to head with the</text>
  <text start="508.12" dur="3.919">deep state and the deep state is</text>
  <text start="509.95" dur="4.5">continuing with their plans actually</text>
  <text start="512.039" dur="5.591">Trump is out there saying Russia should</text>
  <text start="514.45" dur="7.23">join the g7 they should be including in</text>
  <text start="517.63" dur="6.39">this because Russia is an industrialized</text>
  <text start="521.68" dur="5.87">nation and they should be included and</text>
  <text start="524.02" dur="6.45">we should call it the g8 and once again</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="5.14">he&amp;#39;s trying to bring Russia back into</text>
  <text start="530.47" dur="4.32">the fold here and what is the deep state</text>
  <text start="532.69" dur="4.41">what what do they want they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="534.79" dur="4.95">this to happen remember Russia has taken</text>
  <text start="537.1" dur="4.41">over the private wasn&amp;#39;t central bank he</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="5.789">has taken it away from the Rothschilds</text>
  <text start="541.51" dur="6.66">and they don&amp;#39;t like this that country is</text>
  <text start="545.529" dur="5.131">an enemy Iran is an enemy Syria is going</text>
  <text start="548.17" dur="4.98">to be an enemy Venezuela going to be an</text>
  <text start="550.66" dur="4.59">enemy is an enemy all these countries</text>
  <text start="553.15" dur="4.439">that don&amp;#39;t have a Rothschild central</text>
  <text start="555.25" dur="4.95">bank where they can control it they have</text>
  <text start="557.589" dur="7.171">become the enemy this is how it works</text>
  <text start="560.2" dur="7.35">now it looks like poroshenko is speaking</text>
  <text start="564.76" dur="4.86">to Putin on the phone and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="567.55" dur="5.22">to be talking about the exchange of</text>
  <text start="569.62" dur="5.46">detainees so hopefully with this</text>
  <text start="572.77" dur="5.49">telephone call which was initiated by</text>
  <text start="575.08" dur="6.09">poroshenko on Saturday that they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="578.26" dur="5.67">talking about peace having exchange of</text>
  <text start="581.17" dur="6.15">prisoners and maybe they can push this</text>
  <text start="583.93" dur="5.16">to the next level we see right now that</text>
  <text start="587.32" dur="3.63">there is a ceasefire and Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="589.09" dur="4.74">with the Taliban and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="590.95" dur="4.74">u.s. right now is making the move on the</text>
  <text start="593.83" dur="4.23">Islamic state so the forces do not have</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="4.62">to fight the Taliban right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="598.06" dur="5.07">pulling them back and redirecting them</text>
  <text start="600.31" dur="4.71">to destroy the Islamic state and I do</text>
  <text start="603.13" dur="3.99">believe at this point they&amp;#39;re going and</text>
  <text start="605.02" dur="5.15">basically destroying the poppy fields</text>
  <text start="607.12" dur="5.37">getting taking them over from the CIA</text>
  <text start="610.17" dur="4.9">actually destroying the paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="612.49" dur="5.07">army in Afghanistan and we can see right</text>
  <text start="615.07" dur="5.01">now because with this ceasefire it opens</text>
  <text start="617.56" dur="5.25">up to a lot more US troops to go after</text>
  <text start="620.08" dur="4.86">the Islamic state now we know that Iraq</text>
  <text start="622.81" dur="3.78">they wanted to have a recount</text>
  <text start="624.94" dur="5.22">remember the deep state they didn&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="626.59" dur="5.55">what how these elections turned out so</text>
  <text start="630.16" dur="4.95">Abadi said listen we need to have a</text>
  <text start="632.14" dur="4.14">recount here of 11 million votes we</text>
  <text start="635.11" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t know how long this is going to</text>
  <text start="636.28" dur="4.2">take but this needs to be done because I</text>
  <text start="638.71" dur="3.69">can&amp;#39;t believe this is how the elections</text>
  <text start="640.48" dur="6.45">turn now but something very strange</text>
  <text start="642.4" dur="8.25">happened with this recount a fire broke</text>
  <text start="646.93" dur="5.25">out at the warehouse in Baghdad where</text>
  <text start="650.65" dur="4.44">the ballots from the recent Iraqi</text>
  <text start="652.18" dur="6.14">parliamentary elections are stored the</text>
  <text start="655.09" dur="6.78">whole thing went up in flames and</text>
  <text start="658.32" dur="5.89">basically the ballots were inside so</text>

  <text start="737.44" dur="5.37">the leaders taking one side and Trump</text>
  <text start="740.47" dur="4.74">and us taking another side going head to</text>
  <text start="742.81" dur="3.57">head normally all the leaders would</text>
