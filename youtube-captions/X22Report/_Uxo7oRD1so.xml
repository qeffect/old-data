  <text start="68.46" dur="5.49">sodas Trump it&amp;#39;s gonna get a lot worse</text>
  <text start="71.66" dur="5.5">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="6.029">financial news now as we can see gold is</text>
  <text start="77.16" dur="5.36">being suppressed the market has been</text>
  <text start="79.979" dur="5.071">falling today it&amp;#39;s up a little bit and</text>
  <text start="82.52" dur="4.51">cryptocurrencies have been pushed out</text>
  <text start="85.05" dur="4.23">and suppressed and this is all part of</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="3.75">the central bank&amp;#39;s plan you need to</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="4.199">remember the central bank is very</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="4.17">worried about other currencies systems</text>
  <text start="93.479" dur="4.321">they don&amp;#39;t want any of them to go up</text>
  <text start="94.95" dur="5.34">against what they have because they can</text>
  <text start="97.8" dur="4.679">maintain control if everyone uses and</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="4.859">the government support their currency</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="4.621">system this is how they&amp;#39;re in existence</text>
  <text start="105.149" dur="4.11">if there&amp;#39;s any other currency that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="4.2">coming out or if there&amp;#39;s gold and silver</text>
  <text start="109.259" dur="5.401">or anything else that might challenge</text>
  <text start="111.3" dur="5.31">their position they demonize it they</text>
  <text start="114.66" dur="4.61">suppress it they manipulate it they do</text>
  <text start="116.61" dur="5.009">whatever they possibly can to control it</text>
  <text start="119.27" dur="5.08">think what they&amp;#39;ve done in the precious</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="5.28">metals market look what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="124.35" dur="3.93">now with the crypto currencies and we</text>
  <text start="126.899" dur="4.08">can see right now that the Federal</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="4.44">Reserve Bank of st. Louis they added the</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="4.111">crypto currency to their Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="6.48">economic data that&amp;#39;s the phred database</text>
  <text start="135.09" dur="6.45">and we could see that they added Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="139.2" dur="5.67">they added a theory and they added</text>
  <text start="141.54" dur="5.1">Bitcoin cash they added litecoin and the</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="3.63">reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this is because</text>
  <text start="146.64" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing they did</text>
  <text start="148.5" dur="5.04">with gold the same thing they did with</text>
  <text start="150.51" dur="5.67">silver they want control over it and if</text>
  <text start="153.54" dur="4.95">they add it to this guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="156.18" dur="4.68">gonna say it&amp;#39;s not a currency that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="158.49" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s added to here and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="160.86" dur="4.68">control it don&amp;#39;t worry about it we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="162.66" dur="4.26">stabilize it and the people won&amp;#39;t give</text>
  <text start="165.54" dur="3">it a you know two thoughts they&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="166.92" dur="4.17">think it&amp;#39;s another investment vehicle</text>
  <text start="168.54" dur="5.19">and they won&amp;#39;t even think that this</text>
  <text start="171.09" dur="4.619">could be a currency system and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="4.32">done this with gold they&amp;#39;ve done it with</text>
  <text start="175.709" dur="4.531">silver that&amp;#39;s why a lot of Americans</text>
  <text start="178.05" dur="4.17">today do not own gold and silver</text>
  <text start="180.24" dur="4.98">actually the rest of the world owns a</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="5.03">lot of gold and silver but the central</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="5.48">banks their job is to</text>
  <text start="187.25" dur="6.21">convince everyone that their currency is</text>
  <text start="190.7" dur="5.04">the only currency and this is all you</text>
  <text start="193.46" dur="4.2">need to use and you&amp;#39;ll be enslaved to</text>
  <text start="195.74" dur="3.6">them for the rest of your life that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.66" dur="3.42">what they&amp;#39;ve been doing all alone all</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="4.05">along and if you want to learn more</text>
  <text start="201.08" dur="5.43">about crypto currencies how to move in</text>
  <text start="203.39" dur="5.7">and out of them how to basically trade</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="4.68">it or if you&amp;#39;re in the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="5.49">you just want to learn about it well</text>
  <text start="211.19" dur="6.03">just go to the x-22 report school comm</text>

  <text start="217.22" dur="4.56">is the crypto school and you can read</text>

  <text start="221.78" dur="3.33">which is the school and you can join up</text>
  <text start="223.91" dur="4.32">to the school or you can look at the</text>

  <text start="236.6" dur="5.07">place or both if you&amp;#39;d like it&amp;#39;s x-22</text>
  <text start="238.97" dur="5.73">reports cool calm and this will</text>
  <text start="241.67" dur="6.81">basically educate you and hopefully make</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="6.65">you money at the same time now here in</text>
  <text start="248.48" dur="5.91">the United States were seeing the entire</text>
  <text start="251.35" dur="4.9">system breaking down all at the same</text>
  <text start="254.39" dur="5.159">time and we&amp;#39;re seeing both sides the</text>
  <text start="256.25" dur="6">central bank and we are seeing Trump in</text>
  <text start="259.549" dur="4.921">the Patriots pushing to control the</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="5.1">narrative the central bank is doing the</text>
  <text start="264.47" dur="4.11">same exact thing and we see here in the</text>
  <text start="267.35" dur="3.21">United States and not just here in the</text>
  <text start="268.58" dur="4.92">United States but around the world the</text>
  <text start="270.56" dur="6">economy is starting to break apart we</text>
  <text start="273.5" dur="5.52">see manufacturing well PMI has plunged</text>
  <text start="276.56" dur="5.4">to seven month lows orders are tumbling</text>
  <text start="279.02" dur="5.64">we saw yesterday the Philly Fed has</text>
  <text start="281.96" dur="7.08">declined and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="284.66" dur="6.9">is this fake push that was pushing</text>
  <text start="289.04" dur="2.79">everything up is coming to an end right</text>
  <text start="291.56" dur="3.78">now</text>
  <text start="291.83" dur="6.48">and we&amp;#39;re seeing surging prices we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="6.88">seeing the orders get crushed production</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="6.7">is continuing which is kind of crazy</text>
  <text start="302.22" dur="4.64">that&amp;#39;s not gonna be a recipe for success</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="6.03">that&amp;#39;s gonna be a recipe for a disaster</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="6.16">we see that Trump is threatening 20%</text>
  <text start="311.04" dur="5.64">tariffs on all cars coming to the u.s.</text>
  <text start="313.02" dur="6">from Europe and when you really look at</text>
  <text start="316.68" dur="4.62">this you can see why he is doing this</text>
  <text start="319.02" dur="5.1">and why he&amp;#39;s pushing these tariffs now</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="4.41">is this going to help the situation is</text>
  <text start="324.12" dur="3.66">this gonna bring manufacturing back is</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s gonna help the economy that were in</text>
  <text start="327.78" dur="5.49">today most likely not I think what has</text>
  <text start="331.17" dur="3.39">been happening all along and we have to</text>
  <text start="333.27" dur="2.67">remember the central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="334.56" dur="4.44">charged the deep state has been in</text>
  <text start="335.94" dur="5.07">charge and they basically shaped the the</text>
  <text start="339" dur="4.89">economy the way they wanted it they</text>
  <text start="341.01" dur="5.16">removed manufacturing they had NAFTA</text>
  <text start="343.89" dur="5.4">they were going after TPP they were</text>
  <text start="346.17" dur="6.14">bringing in illegal immigrants they</text>
  <text start="349.29" dur="7.74">destroyed the dollar overtime it&amp;#39;s lost</text>
  <text start="352.31" dur="7.21">almost all its value since it was put</text>
  <text start="357.03" dur="3.81">into place in 1971 when we went came off</text>
  <text start="359.52" dur="4.38">the gold standard I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="360.84" dur="6.27">petro dollar that is completely</text>
  <text start="363.9" dur="6.36">destroyed and right now what they were</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="5.16">doing is they were using this model</text>
  <text start="370.26" dur="4.77">their central banking model to have a</text>
  <text start="372.27" dur="5.19">centralized system a globalist system</text>
  <text start="375.03" dur="4.2">where all countries would be equal why</text>
  <text start="377.46" dur="3.3">do you think they move manufacturing and</text>
  <text start="379.23" dur="5.7">everything out of this country because</text>
  <text start="380.76" dur="6.51">their plan was to destroy the United</text>
  <text start="384.93" dur="4.29">States the manufacturing base and bring</text>
  <text start="387.27" dur="3.78">it down to the level of all the other</text>
  <text start="389.22" dur="4.41">countries and this is why they had the</text>
  <text start="391.05" dur="4.47">refugees immigrants flowing into Europe</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="3.72">flowing into the United States because</text>
  <text start="395.52" dur="4.17">they were trying to equal everything out</text>
  <text start="397.35" dur="4.11">and the reason why you needed the</text>
  <text start="399.69" dur="3.24">immigrants in the United States and this</text>
  <text start="401.46" dur="4.68">is just one part of the agenda is</text>
  <text start="402.93" dur="5.28">because when the pay starts to decline</text>
  <text start="406.14" dur="3.59">oh wait the pay is declining right now</text>
  <text start="408.21" dur="4.38">but when it really starts to decline</text>
  <text start="409.73" dur="4.21">who&amp;#39;s going to take the jobs well most</text>
  <text start="412.59" dur="3.51">Americans are going to sit out there and</text>
  <text start="413.94" dur="4.53">say well I don&amp;#39;t want that job I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="416.1" dur="4.05">making half well don&amp;#39;t worry we have an</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="4.62">illegal immigrant that will be more than</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="5.25">happy to take that job and what would</text>
  <text start="423.09" dur="4.2">happen going down the line is most</text>
  <text start="425.4" dur="3.51">Americans would be out of jobs and they</text>
  <text start="427.29" dur="4.08">keep bringing in illegal immigrants and</text>
  <text start="428.91" dur="4.89">they would take up the jobs and that</text>
  <text start="431.37" dur="4.919">would allow them to bring the</text>
  <text start="433.8" dur="4.679">wages down to the level of other</text>
  <text start="436.289" dur="3.961">countries this way they can swap workers</text>
  <text start="438.479" dur="3.211">back and forth and when you look at</text>
  <text start="440.25" dur="3.96">these tariffs that they put in place</text>
  <text start="441.69" dur="6.09">well it didn&amp;#39;t benefit the United States</text>
  <text start="444.21" dur="7.34">I mean currently right now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="447.78" dur="8.789">charges 2.5 percent on car imports and</text>
  <text start="451.55" dur="7.66">the EU is charging 10% China 25% but</text>
  <text start="456.569" dur="5.731">China as of July 1st is going to be</text>
  <text start="459.21" dur="4.65">charging 15% and you can see that this</text>
  <text start="462.3" dur="5.07">was set up not to benefit the United</text>
  <text start="463.86" dur="5.94">States whatsoever and now what Trump is</text>
  <text start="467.37" dur="5.25">trying to do is equal things out now</text>
  <text start="469.8" dur="4.47">again all of this was put into place by</text>
  <text start="472.62" dur="4.259">the globalist by the central banks and</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="4.619">this was all done on purpose and what is</text>
  <text start="476.879" dur="3.961">being done right now is all of this is</text>
  <text start="478.889" dur="4.08">being undone and this is why the</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="3.69">corporate media the central bank</text>
  <text start="482.969" dur="3.45">everyone&amp;#39;s screaming and yelling that</text>
  <text start="484.53" dur="3.479">this is going to cause a war the only</text>
  <text start="486.419" dur="3.691">thing that will cause a war is the</text>
  <text start="488.009" dur="3.78">central bank because once they move to</text>
  <text start="490.11" dur="3.239">try to destroy the central bank and get</text>
  <text start="491.789" dur="3.481">rid of it well that&amp;#39;s when the central</text>
  <text start="493.349" dur="4.981">bank fights back because they&amp;#39;d rather</text>
  <text start="495.27" dur="5.85">have a war than give up control Bank of</text>
  <text start="498.33" dur="5.61">America right now is stunned by the</text>
  <text start="501.12" dur="4.889">panic to buy tech stocks now we know</text>
  <text start="503.94" dur="4.289">that the Swiss the central bank there</text>
  <text start="506.009" dur="4.981">has been purchasing a lot of tech stocks</text>
  <text start="508.229" dur="5.401">we know that a lot of other investors</text>
  <text start="510.99" dur="6.27">have been flooding into the tech stocks</text>
  <text start="513.63" dur="7.409">and the last time we saw a panic</text>
  <text start="517.26" dur="6.99">scramble into tech stocks like this was</text>
  <text start="521.039" dur="6.781">right before the dot-com bubble this</text>
  <text start="524.25" dur="6.87">should tell you something right there we</text>
  <text start="527.82" dur="6.509">see right now that another central bank</text>
  <text start="531.12" dur="4.95">is getting ready to unwind and this is</text>
  <text start="534.329" dur="3.361">the Bank of England so we have the</text>
  <text start="536.07" dur="3.629">Federal Reserve we have the Bank of</text>
  <text start="537.69" dur="3.899">England as we&amp;#39;re getting ready to unwind</text>
  <text start="539.699" dur="4.981">they decided to raise their rates up to</text>
  <text start="541.589" dur="5.671">0.75 percent and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="544.68" dur="4.23">that the ECB they are now tapering so</text>
  <text start="547.26" dur="4.17">all the central banks now are coming</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="4.98">together and they are using the same</text>
  <text start="551.43" dur="6.81">exact plan where they&amp;#39;re going to unwind</text>
  <text start="553.89" dur="7.08">raise rates into a fake economy one that</text>
  <text start="558.24" dur="5.01">they created and gave the illusion that</text>
  <text start="560.97" dur="5.19">everything is great now this is all</text>
  <text start="563.25" dur="3.19">being done on purpose coordinated just</text>
  <text start="566.16" dur="3.31">like</text>
  <text start="566.44" dur="5.49">coronated the stimulus and bringing down</text>
  <text start="569.47" dur="3.9">interest rates bringing them down to the</text>
  <text start="571.93" dur="4.23">negative territory this was all</text>
  <text start="573.37" dur="4.92">coordinated back then to pump the system</text>
  <text start="576.16" dur="4.68">up to make it look like it was doing</text>
  <text start="578.29" dur="4.68">great now it&amp;#39;s a coordinated effort in</text>
  <text start="580.84" dur="4.23">the opposite direction why are they</text>
  <text start="582.97" dur="4.77">doing this right now they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="585.07" dur="5.79">right now because they realize they are</text>
  <text start="587.74" dur="5.34">stuck and they realize the person they</text>
  <text start="590.86" dur="4.59">wanted in office the person that was</text>
  <text start="593.08" dur="4.86">going to you know push this to the edge</text>
  <text start="595.45" dur="4.56">is not there and they were gonna use an</text>
  <text start="597.94" dur="4.08">event to explain away why everything is</text>
  <text start="600.01" dur="5.07">crashing they don&amp;#39;t have that right now</text>
  <text start="602.02" dur="5.76">so they need to do something where they</text>
  <text start="605.08" dur="4.08">need to blame it on somebody else they</text>
  <text start="607.78" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t have a country they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="609.16" dur="4.29">group anymore and that&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="611.44" dur="4.05">gone so they need to blame it on</text>
  <text start="613.45" dur="4.29">someone&amp;#39;s policies so they started the</text>
  <text start="615.49" dur="4.8">push right now of unwinding and raising</text>
  <text start="617.74" dur="5.13">rates because they understand if they do</text>
  <text start="620.29" dur="4.5">this slowly it won&amp;#39;t look like the</text>
  <text start="622.87" dur="4.44">central bank is doing this it will look</text>
  <text start="624.79" dur="5.25">like it&amp;#39;s Trump&amp;#39;s policies now on the</text>
  <text start="627.31" dur="4.98">other hand Trump and the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="630.04" dur="5.31">are doing the same thing they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="632.29" dur="5.43">tariffs they&amp;#39;re changing things around</text>
  <text start="635.35" dur="4.47">getting rid of their trade agreements</text>
  <text start="637.72" dur="4.26">and they&amp;#39;re true what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="639.82" dur="5.03">do is push this to the edge to gain a</text>
  <text start="641.98" dur="6.72">narrative now the IMF is out there and</text>
  <text start="644.85" dur="6.46">this is Christine Lagarde one minute</text>
  <text start="648.7" dur="4.86">she&amp;#39;s saying that the European growth is</text>
  <text start="651.31" dur="3.15">stable it&amp;#39;s going to continue it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="653.56" dur="5.04">to be fantastic</text>
  <text start="654.46" dur="6.93">now the European growth well they might</text>
  <text start="658.6" dur="4.89">have to revise it down and basically</text>
  <text start="661.39" dur="3.99">what is happening is they&amp;#39;re blaming it</text>
  <text start="663.49" dur="4.44">on the brexit of course it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="665.38" dur="5.94">their way and they&amp;#39;re blaming it now on</text>
  <text start="667.93" dur="6.48">Italy because Italy is now on the policy</text>
  <text start="671.32" dur="4.5">of Italy first breaking away from the</text>
  <text start="674.41" dur="4.02">European Union I think that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="675.82" dur="5.04">endgame there and they know it and every</text>
  <text start="678.43" dur="5.04">time the IMF came out and gave a</text>
  <text start="680.86" dur="3.93">forecast in the past and if you look at</text>
  <text start="683.47" dur="3.78">this you can see they were forecasting</text>
  <text start="684.79" dur="5.52">you know three four percent do you know</text>
  <text start="687.25" dur="6.089">they were wrong every single time and if</text>
  <text start="690.31" dur="6.84">you look at the actual growth it is</text>
  <text start="693.339" dur="6.451">declined every single year and every</text>
  <text start="697.15" dur="5.07">single year they&amp;#39;ve told us it was going</text>
  <text start="699.79" dur="7.34">to increase their forecasts are</text>
  <text start="702.22" dur="9.27">worthless let me give an example the</text>
  <text start="707.13" dur="7.51">world GDP growth forecast from 2010 to</text>
  <text start="711.49" dur="6.87">2020 if you look it started at five</text>
  <text start="714.64" dur="6.9">point five at 2010 and they gave a</text>
  <text start="718.36" dur="7.47">forecast in September of 2011 saying it</text>
  <text start="721.54" dur="7.65">was going to be around 4.5 well it was</text>
  <text start="725.83" dur="5.7">it dropped to 4 went straight down then</text>
  <text start="729.19" dur="5.07">they gave another forecast in October of</text>
  <text start="731.53" dur="6.75">2012 saying well don&amp;#39;t worry it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="734.26" dur="6.78">be 4 point 4 percent well the growth was</text>
  <text start="738.28" dur="5.58">three point five percent they gave a</text>
  <text start="741.04" dur="4.5">forecast in October of 2013 and they</text>
  <text start="743.86" dur="6.12">said don&amp;#39;t worry it&amp;#39;s going to be 4</text>
  <text start="745.54" dur="7.98">percent and what was it three point</text>
  <text start="749.98" dur="7.89">three percent then they gave another</text>
  <text start="753.52" dur="5.94">forecast in 2014 where they&amp;#39;re saying it</text>
  <text start="757.87" dur="3.99">was going to be three point nine percent</text>
  <text start="759.46" dur="4.62">well that came in at three point three</text>
  <text start="761.86" dur="5.25">percent again then they gave another</text>
  <text start="764.08" dur="5.13">forecast in 2015 saying it was going to</text>
  <text start="767.11" dur="6.03">be three point seven five percent and</text>
  <text start="769.21" dur="8.22">guess what it was at three percent they</text>
  <text start="773.14" dur="5.82">were wrong every single time and when</text>
  <text start="777.43" dur="4.11">you look at the annual growth it is</text>
  <text start="778.96" dur="7.23">declining and declining and declining</text>
  <text start="781.54" dur="7.85">because you cannot grow globally if</text>
  <text start="786.19" dur="7.14">you&amp;#39;re saturated with debt it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="789.39" dur="5.62">work and I see a lot of articles out</text>
  <text start="793.33" dur="4.62">there a lot of financial pundits saying</text>
  <text start="795.01" dur="5.49">that Donald Trump&amp;#39;s trade wars could</text>
  <text start="797.95" dur="4.8">lead to the Great Depression yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="800.5" dur="6.51">absolutely right and it&amp;#39;s not for the</text>
  <text start="802.75" dur="5.82">reasons they think it&amp;#39;s because the only</text>
  <text start="807.01" dur="3.72">way out of this system right now you</text>
  <text start="808.57" dur="3.87">just can&amp;#39;t bring all the plants back the</text>
  <text start="810.73" dur="3.96">manufacturing remember they spent years</text>
  <text start="812.44" dur="4.23">and years and years moving thing out</text>
  <text start="814.69" dur="4.68">moving everything out of the United</text>
  <text start="816.67" dur="4.5">States he can&amp;#39;t bring everything back in</text>
  <text start="819.37" dur="6.29">two years or three years or four years</text>
  <text start="821.17" dur="8.21">it just won&amp;#39;t work why because right now</text>
  <text start="825.66" dur="5.73">the system can&amp;#39;t move anywhere</text>
  <text start="829.38" dur="4.56">the inflation that&amp;#39;s going to hit is</text>
  <text start="831.39" dur="5.48">going to be outrageous that dollar is</text>
  <text start="833.94" dur="5.88">losing value there is too much debt and</text>
  <text start="836.87" dur="5.61">companies do not have incentives to come</text>
  <text start="839.82" dur="6.27">back here labor is much cheaper</text>
  <text start="842.48" dur="7.21">elsewhere and under this central banking</text>
  <text start="846.09" dur="8.07">system the only way to get out of it is</text>
  <text start="849.69" dur="7.29">to destroy it it&amp;#39;s to push it to the</text>
  <text start="854.16" dur="5.37">edge and have it collapse and control</text>
  <text start="856.98" dur="5.79">the narrative where you can say it was</text>
  <text start="859.53" dur="7.38">the central banking economic policies</text>
  <text start="862.77" dur="5.79">that drove us to this point and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="866.91" dur="3.72">gonna have to make a case they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="868.56" dur="3.54">have to show proof they&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="870.63" dur="3.57">do an audit they&amp;#39;re gonna have to show</text>
  <text start="872.1" dur="3.93">all these things to show everyone that</text>
  <text start="874.2" dur="3.15">yes it was the central bank so they can</text>
  <text start="876.03" dur="3.39">get rid of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="877.35" dur="3.51">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the private</text>
  <text start="879.42" dur="4.56">western central banking system the</text>
  <text start="880.86" dur="4.95">Rothschild central bank system and we</text>
  <text start="883.98" dur="5.81">can see right now that is what this</text>
  <text start="885.81" dur="7.2">battle is all about and this is the push</text>
  <text start="889.79" dur="5.92">so when people say yes you know he could</text>
  <text start="893.01" dur="4.62">push us into a depression the central</text>
  <text start="895.71" dur="4.02">bank is already pushing us into a</text>
  <text start="897.63" dur="4.5">depression but their fingers are</text>
  <text start="899.73" dur="4.95">pointing someplace else the depression</text>
  <text start="902.13" dur="3.87">is already in the cards the collapse is</text>
  <text start="904.68" dur="4.29">already in the cards there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="906" dur="6.03">around this and it&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="908.97" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re gonna make a transition now with</text>
  <text start="912.03" dur="4.05">the central bank they don&amp;#39;t care how it</text>
  <text start="914.31" dur="3.21">happens that it can come down hard and</text>
  <text start="916.08" dur="3.21">fast like they don&amp;#39;t care how many</text>
  <text start="917.52" dur="3.89">people are hurt makes no difference</text>
  <text start="919.29" dur="5.34">I think what Trump is trying to do is</text>
  <text start="921.41" dur="5.4">basically soften the fall and make it a</text>
  <text start="924.63" dur="4.44">little bit easier is it gonna be easy no</text>
  <text start="926.81" dur="4.99">it&amp;#39;s gonna be difficult many people</text>
  <text start="929.07" dur="3.84">aren&amp;#39;t awake and those people are gonna</text>
  <text start="931.8" dur="4.23">have trouble those people have been</text>
  <text start="932.91" dur="4.41">preparing insuring their wealth I think</text>
  <text start="936.03" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;ll be able to weather weather the</text>
  <text start="937.32" dur="2.7">storm if you look in Russia and you look</text>
  <text start="938.76" dur="3.69">in other countries those people that are</text>
  <text start="940.02" dur="4.2">holding gold silver and now crypto</text>

  <text start="944.22" dur="2.91">happens when you go through these</text>
  <text start="945.63" dur="5.39">transition a lot of the manipulation</text>

  <text start="951.02" dur="5.13">price of these assets are then revealed</text>
