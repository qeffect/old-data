  <text start="30.42" dur="5.22">hi and welcome you listening to the x 22</text>
  <text start="34.14" dur="4.62">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="35.64" dur="6.63">episode 1035 a and today&amp;#39;s date is july</text>
  <text start="38.76" dur="6.15">29th 2016 and thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="42.27" dur="6.66">US economic growth continues to decline</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="6.36">the collapse accelerates let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="48.93" dur="5.519">the economic collapse financial news</text>
  <text start="51.27" dur="6.27">let&amp;#39;s head out to Greece and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="54.449" dur="5.221">talking about Greece and how more and</text>
  <text start="57.54" dur="6.63">more debt doesn&amp;#39;t improve the economy</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="6.6">and we&amp;#39;re not rocket scientists we just</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="5.82">looked at the entire situation we use</text>
  <text start="66.27" dur="6.99">common sense and we said yet Pylea more</text>
  <text start="69.99" dur="6.54">debt on a country does not spur economic</text>
  <text start="73.26" dur="6.36">growth now there was a paper that was</text>
  <text start="76.53" dur="5.519">published this month and the IMF came</text>
  <text start="79.62" dur="5.33">out and studied the relationship between</text>
  <text start="82.049" dur="7.531">GDP and sovereign debt restructuring</text>
  <text start="84.95" dur="8.709">using data from 1972 2010 its main</text>
  <text start="89.58" dur="6.149">conclusion said that the central finding</text>
  <text start="93.659" dur="3.721">of this paper is that sovereign debt</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="5.49">restructuring with external private</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="7.29">creditors can affect per capita GDP</text>
  <text start="101.219" dur="6.54">growth in the years after the debt</text>
  <text start="104.67" dur="6.42">restructuring really they needed a whole</text>
  <text start="107.759" dur="5.96">study on this I mean just think about</text>
  <text start="111.09" dur="5.76">this for a second take your own finances</text>
  <text start="113.719" dur="6.43">if you went out and you piled on more</text>
  <text start="116.85" dur="6.079">and more debt using credit cards keeping</text>
  <text start="120.149" dur="7.801">your revenue stream the exact same way</text>
  <text start="122.929" dur="8.801">what happens well it cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="7.86">well that&amp;#39;s exactly what happens in a</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="8.46">country when you pile on the debt you</text>
  <text start="135.81" dur="8.33">tell the government you need to lay off</text>
  <text start="140.19" dur="6.24">people cut programs lay off some more</text>
  <text start="144.14" dur="6.72">less revenue is going to be coming into</text>
  <text start="146.43" dur="7.74">the government to pay for this loan and</text>
  <text start="150.86" dur="7.47">if they can&amp;#39;t pay for the loan they need</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="7.75">more of it it&amp;#39;s a very simple thing but</text>
  <text start="158.33" dur="7.87">when they did this study</text>
  <text start="161.92" dur="9.21">they really didn&amp;#39;t include Greece in</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="6.009">2012 in their analysis because if you</text>
  <text start="171.13" dur="3.66">really think about it this is the</text>
  <text start="172.209" dur="6.481">largest sovereign restructuring in</text>
  <text start="174.79" dur="6.66">history so they didn&amp;#39;t even include that</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="5.37">because if they did include that it</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="3.869">would show that this whole system that</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="6.99">they&amp;#39;re talking about right now is a</text>
  <text start="185.319" dur="8.971">complete disaster so we can see right</text>
  <text start="191.05" dur="7.86">now that whatever the central bankers</text>
  <text start="194.29" dur="8">are doing it will not help any of the</text>
  <text start="198.91" dur="7.68">economy&amp;#39;s all it will do is add debt</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="5.97">just like in the eurozone we see the</text>
  <text start="206.59" dur="5.179">economic growth there in the eurozone</text>
  <text start="208.26" dur="7.18">well it is in half in the second quarter</text>
  <text start="211.769" dur="6.521">France has ground to a halt unemployment</text>
  <text start="215.44" dur="5.43">is a little bit above ten percent right</text>
  <text start="218.29" dur="6.69">now of course those the official numbers</text>
  <text start="220.87" dur="5.489">I&amp;#39;m sure if we recalculate it and get</text>
  <text start="224.98" dur="3.78">rid of the manipulation those numbers</text>
  <text start="226.359" dur="6.621">are going to be much much higher but we</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="9.77">can see right now of the 19 country</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="8.91">block they rose only 0.3%</text>
  <text start="238.53" dur="6.01">quarter-on-quarter in April till June</text>
  <text start="241.89" dur="7.45">slowing from the point six percent in</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="6.39">the first quarter of this year so what</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="5.239">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="7.01">slow down everything is slowing down and</text>
  <text start="254.579" dur="5.38">it&amp;#39;s getting worse now of course</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="4.57">governments like to manipulate their</text>
  <text start="259.959" dur="5.101">numbers just like the u.s. we talked</text>
  <text start="262.51" dur="3.779">about this before in other reports and</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="3.47">we know that the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="266.289" dur="5.94">are much much higher if you go back to</text>
  <text start="268.53" dur="6.63">2008 to this point do you see that the</text>
  <text start="272.229" dur="6.651">eurozone has gone absolutely nowhere</text>
  <text start="275.16" dur="8.009">with the creation of money from the ECB</text>
  <text start="278.88" dur="7.63">with QE with buying corporate bonds</text>
  <text start="283.169" dur="7.361">negative interest rates just think about</text>
  <text start="286.51" dur="8.31">this what they needed to do to go</text>
  <text start="290.53" dur="7.02">nowhere to increase the dead</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="4.92">it so they increase the debt and they</text>
  <text start="297.55" dur="4.8">had to do all these things just to</text>
  <text start="299.74" dur="6.77">sustain it is now what the United States</text>
  <text start="302.35" dur="6.69">is doing adding more and more debt and</text>
  <text start="306.51" dur="5.53">what are they doing they&amp;#39;re going out</text>
  <text start="309.04" dur="4.68">looking for revenue to keep this going</text>
  <text start="312.04" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s why you have FATCA that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;ve gotta this is why you have</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="4.74">Obamacare this is why they want a carbon</text>
  <text start="317.83" dur="4.74">tax because it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="320.92" dur="3.75">harder as more people lose their jobs or</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="3.57">full-time high-paying jobs or getting</text>
  <text start="324.67" dur="3.69">these part-time jobs or a lot of people</text>
  <text start="326.14" dur="4.86">aren&amp;#39;t getting work the revenue stream</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="5.97">is drying up they&amp;#39;re having a tougher</text>
  <text start="331" dur="5.7">and tougher time keeping this system</text>
  <text start="334.33" dur="3.69">afloat I mean Microsoft they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="336.7" dur="4.74">to lay off another two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="338.02" dur="5.15">hundred and fifty people and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="341.44" dur="6.27">looking at all the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="343.17" dur="7.26">people are tapped out they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="347.71" dur="7.68">the jobs they&amp;#39;re not spending the money</text>
  <text start="350.43" dur="8.5">retail is contracting housing it is</text>
  <text start="355.39" dur="7.5">declining and what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="5.43">things are starting to accelerate where</text>
  <text start="362.89" dur="6.39">everything is starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="364.36" dur="8.16">very very quickly now the chicago PMI it</text>
  <text start="369.28" dur="9.18">dropped modestly in july from 50x50 6.82</text>
  <text start="372.52" dur="9.06">55.8 better than expected of a 54 but</text>
  <text start="378.46" dur="8.64">very interestingly we know that gdp has</text>
  <text start="381.58" dur="12.47">been tumbling and it is odd that chicago</text>
  <text start="387.1" dur="9.96">PMI did better than expected because</text>
  <text start="394.05" dur="6.94">production new orders they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="397.06" dur="8.79">declining in July so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="400.99" dur="8.37">right now is that all of this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="405.85" dur="5.31">make sense now there are certain areas</text>
  <text start="409.36" dur="3.51">that they continually manipulate certain</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="4.92">areas where the manipulation is not</text>
  <text start="412.87" dur="6.29">working we see the Baltic Dry Index it</text>
  <text start="416.08" dur="9.66">is declined by nine points it&amp;#39;s down to</text>
  <text start="419.16" dur="9.009">656 right now and the economy here it is</text>
  <text start="425.74" dur="6.179">not growing</text>
  <text start="428.169" dur="5.911">now Wall Street and everyone else all</text>
  <text start="431.919" dur="3.93">the central bankers they thought this</text>
  <text start="434.08" dur="3.389">economy was going to grow by</text>
  <text start="435.849" dur="4.831">two-point-six percent now we know the</text>
  <text start="437.469" dur="4.651">IMF the u.s. the Fed they all come out</text>
  <text start="440.68" dur="2.789">and say and then they make these</text>
  <text start="442.12" dur="4.169">ridiculous predictions and they never</text>
  <text start="443.469" dur="4.44">come true oh the economy is going to</text>
  <text start="446.289" dur="3.421">grow by 3% it&amp;#39;s going to go by three</text>
  <text start="447.909" dur="4.861">point five percent and all they do is</text>
  <text start="449.71" dur="4.859">they revise lo or revise lower and here</text>
  <text start="452.77" dur="5.699">we are they were expecting it to grow by</text>
  <text start="454.569" dur="6.051">two-point-six percent but guess what the</text>
  <text start="458.469" dur="4.831">economy grew by one point two percent</text>
  <text start="460.62" dur="6.49">now remember this is the manipulated</text>
  <text start="463.3" dur="5.94">number strip out Obamacare strip out</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="4.95">inventories strip out research and</text>
  <text start="469.24" dur="6.389">development these are all manipulation</text>
  <text start="472.06" dur="7.169">in the GDP it will be in the negative</text>
  <text start="475.629" dur="7.41">range now interestingly the first</text>
  <text start="479.229" dur="10.62">quarter GDP well that was slashed from</text>
  <text start="483.039" dur="11.61">1.1 two-point-eight percent this economy</text>
  <text start="489.849" dur="7.081">is dead in the water and what&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="494.649" dur="7.44">more interesting is that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="496.93" dur="9.299">admitting yes we manipulate GDP we do</text>
  <text start="502.089" dur="5.85">this many times during the year and the</text>
  <text start="506.229" dur="4.16">Department of Commerce they announced it</text>
  <text start="507.939" dur="6.451">would it would seasonally adjust your</text>
  <text start="510.389" dur="9.13">first quarter GDP not once but twice in</text>
  <text start="514.39" dur="7.62">order to get better results so the</text>
  <text start="519.519" dur="4.741">government statisticians announced that</text>
  <text start="522.01" dur="3.569">they have found evidence that efforts to</text>
  <text start="524.26" dur="4.319">adjust the country&amp;#39;s measure of economic</text>
  <text start="525.579" dur="7.771">growth for seasonal fluctuation have not</text>
  <text start="528.579" dur="6.901">been fully successful the solution was</text>
  <text start="533.35" dur="4.76">to test all monthly GDP source data</text>
  <text start="535.48" dur="6.839">series at both monthly and quarterly</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="8.08">frequencies so we could see right now</text>
  <text start="542.319" dur="7.111">that there&amp;#39;s a problem with GDP their</text>
  <text start="546.19" dur="4.649">manipulation is not doing what they</text>
  <text start="549.43" dur="4.589">thought it was going to be doing and</text>
  <text start="550.839" dur="4.651">they need to push this up even higher to</text>
  <text start="554.019" dur="4.26">convince everyone I mean these aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="555.49" dur="4.969">real numbers these aren&amp;#39;t really what</text>
  <text start="558.279" dur="3.671">the United States is doing it&amp;#39;s all fake</text>
  <text start="560.459" dur="4.221">just like</text>
  <text start="561.95" dur="4.44">employment just like the retail numbers</text>
  <text start="564.68" dur="3.93">that the government puts out if you</text>
  <text start="566.39" dur="4.08">actually go to each one of the stores to</text>
  <text start="568.61" dur="5.75">see what their sales are doing that is</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="6.93">different but we can see that the</text>
  <text start="574.36" dur="6.31">government continually manipulates all</text>
  <text start="577.4" dur="7.61">the data but they still can&amp;#39;t get the</text>
  <text start="580.67" dur="6.54">revenue in to pay for their debt and</text>
  <text start="585.01" dur="4.72">many of the people around the world say</text>
  <text start="587.21" dur="5.31">you know something I can&amp;#39;t be paying tax</text>
  <text start="589.73" dur="4.71">in the country that I work and to the</text>
  <text start="592.52" dur="3.56">government at the same US government at</text>
  <text start="594.44" dur="3.57">the same time it just not going to work</text>
  <text start="596.08" dur="5.58">so we see more and more people</text>
  <text start="598.01" dur="7.14">renouncing their citizenship actually</text>
  <text start="601.66" dur="8.53">17,000 359 Americans have renounced</text>
  <text start="605.15" dur="6.84">their citizenship under Obama because</text>
  <text start="610.19" dur="7.68">it&amp;#39;s becoming more and more difficult</text>
  <text start="611.99" dur="13.68">now something very interesting it looks</text>
  <text start="617.87" dur="14.24">like Switzerland is exporting gold to</text>
  <text start="625.67" dur="9.24">the US in the past us was exporting gold</text>
  <text start="632.11" dur="7.03">to Switzerland now the tables have</text>
  <text start="634.91" dur="6.51">turned because in May the Swiss exported</text>
  <text start="639.14" dur="4.55">a record amount of gold to the United</text>
  <text start="641.42" dur="9.45">States the United States how much gold</text>
  <text start="643.69" dur="12.01">quite a bit about 20 metric tons in May</text>
  <text start="650.87" dur="10.11">of 2016 now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="655.7" dur="8.16">because in the past we didn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="660.98" dur="6.81">anything like this and we saw like maybe</text>
  <text start="663.86" dur="7.29">one metric ton point 26 metric tons 0</text>
  <text start="667.79" dur="7.92">going back to 2015 and then all of a</text>
  <text start="671.15" dur="7.71">sudden in May we saw this happen what</text>
  <text start="675.71" dur="5.49">does this mean are people understanding</text>
  <text start="678.86" dur="5.61">what&amp;#39;s going on here other wealthy</text>
  <text start="681.2" dur="8.07">saying I need gold is that why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="684.47" dur="6.16">flowing into the United States because</text>
  <text start="689.27" dur="8.05">we know</text>
  <text start="690.63" dur="12.11">as the dollar D values as it implodes we</text>
  <text start="697.32" dur="5.42">know the system is going to collapse and</text>
  <text start="703.52" dur="8.19">those who are in the know realize you</text>
  <text start="707.7" dur="7.62">must have silver gold hard assets</text>
  <text start="711.71" dur="6.7">holding onto paper is not going to help</text>
  <text start="715.32" dur="5.34">maybe in the short run when it first</text>
  <text start="718.41" dur="5.28">happens people will still be accepting</text>
  <text start="720.66" dur="5.16">cash but of course as we know when</text>
  <text start="723.69" dur="5.07">inflation hits just like in Venezuela it</text>
  <text start="725.82" dur="5.88">will become very difficult to keep up</text>
  <text start="728.76" dur="5.37">with the inflation and this is why you</text>
  <text start="731.7" dur="4.29">should have you know a couple thousand</text>
  <text start="734.13" dur="6.24">on hand if you have the ability to do</text>
  <text start="735.99" dur="7.89">this I know many people don&amp;#39;t if you can</text>
  <text start="740.37" dur="6.48">keep a hundred on you or keep items that</text>
  <text start="743.88" dur="4.56">you can barter with that might even be a</text>
  <text start="746.85" dur="5.31">better solution because people always</text>
  <text start="748.44" dur="7.59">use food water medical supplies bullets</text>
  <text start="752.16" dur="6.66">if you have gold and silver hold on to</text>
  <text start="756.03" dur="9.03">those because those will be used later</text>
  <text start="758.82" dur="9.56">on so we see Mont a passion well it</text>
  <text start="765.06" dur="6.24">looks like the bailout is not going well</text>
  <text start="768.38" dur="5.47">this bank has failed it&amp;#39;s stress test</text>
  <text start="771.3" dur="7.43">and we know these stress tests they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="773.85" dur="7.59">just put out there as a cover to</text>
  <text start="778.73" dur="6.37">convince everyone that the banks aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="781.44" dur="5.37">aren&amp;#39;t insolvent but we know they are we</text>
  <text start="785.1" dur="3.69">know they will not be able to handle</text>
  <text start="786.81" dur="4.83">what is coming and this is why they</text>
  <text start="788.79" dur="5.13">created the bail and documents they know</text>
  <text start="791.64" dur="4.88">this but it looks good in the corporate</text>
  <text start="793.92" dur="6.15">media they passed all their stress tests</text>
  <text start="796.52" dur="7.03">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is he use</text>
  <text start="800.07" dur="6.84">Younker said that the banking sector in</text>
  <text start="803.55" dur="5.76">Italy and elsewhere in Europe will be</text>
  <text start="806.91" dur="6.02">protected and the European Commission</text>
  <text start="809.31" dur="7.35">will do everything to prevent a bank run</text>
