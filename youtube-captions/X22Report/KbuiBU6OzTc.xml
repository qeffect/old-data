  <text start="35.67" dur="4.02">this episode is are the central bankers</text>
  <text start="37.8" dur="3.539">using the Ebola scare to declare martial</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="3.899">law now we&amp;#39;re going to get a little bit</text>
  <text start="41.339" dur="4.081">into this later in the report and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="43.589" dur="4.051">going to talk about the Ebola scare and</text>
  <text start="45.42" dur="4.739">what the government is doing and what</text>
  <text start="47.64" dur="4.86">they actually could do if this thing</text>
  <text start="50.159" dur="4.921">goes widespread and if it really is true</text>
  <text start="52.5" dur="4.549">that this is spreading but let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="55.08" dur="4.829">into the economic collapse news now</text>
  <text start="57.049" dur="4.51">yesterday we reported on Argentina it</text>
  <text start="59.909" dur="3.72">was all over the corporate media there</text>
  <text start="61.559" dur="3.361">in selective default and that is coming</text>
  <text start="63.629" dur="3.451">from Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#39;s and today</text>
  <text start="64.92" dur="4.61">Argentina has accused the u.s. of</text>
  <text start="67.08" dur="5.249">judicial malpractice for triggering an</text>
  <text start="69.53" dur="4.93">unnecessary default after US courts</text>
  <text start="72.329" dur="4.311">allowed to small hedge funds to demand</text>
  <text start="74.46" dur="4.979">bond conversation from the country</text>
  <text start="76.64" dur="5.14">Argentina now has threatened to take the</text>
  <text start="79.439" dur="5.311">u.s. to international court for justice</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="5.04">and the President of Argentina saying no</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="4.71">the country is not in a financial</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="4.649">default stressing that there are still</text>
  <text start="89.46" dur="4.229">opportunities down in Argentina and we</text>
  <text start="91.469" dur="4.021">have to remember Argentina still is</text>
  <text start="93.689" dur="4.771">making deals with China and the BRIC</text>
  <text start="95.49" dur="5.25">nations and China has loaned billions of</text>
  <text start="98.46" dur="4.38">dollars to Argentina we&amp;#39;ll have to watch</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="3.629">us and see how this plays out here in</text>
  <text start="102.84" dur="4.23">the United States what are we saying</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="5.04">well the government has come in with</text>
  <text start="107.07" dur="4.229">their unemployment numbers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="4.49">not as good as they thought that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="111.299" dur="5.82">going to be I guess they didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="113.899" dur="5.26">entire statistical team manipulating the</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="3.121">numbers or the numbers were so way off</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="2.91">that there were so many people</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="4.049">unemployed that it would look really</text>
  <text start="122.069" dur="4.11">kind of obvious if they said you know</text>
  <text start="124.289" dur="4.08">what the unemployment came down to 62</text>
  <text start="126.179" dur="4.351">about five point eight percent but what</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="4.771">happened here is that the jaw the July</text>
  <text start="130.53" dur="6.78">payroll print missed they were expecting</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="6.45">about 230,000 it came in around 209 they</text>
  <text start="137.31" dur="6.45">did a revised number in June</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="6.57">and they revised that up to 209 298,000</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="6.66">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing from all this and</text>
  <text start="146.16" dur="6.87">there was a household survey done on who</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="4.47">actually has jobs and how many people</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="4.14">have found jobs and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="4.909">when they did this household survey is</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="5.49">that only a hundred and thirty one</text>
  <text start="159.799" dur="6.071">thousand thirty one thousand jobs were</text>
  <text start="162.66" dur="6.54">created in July so it is much much worse</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="7.56">than their reporting and this is way</text>
  <text start="169.2" dur="6.869">down from 407 thousand in June so we can</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="4.47">see right now that unemployment ticked</text>
  <text start="176.069" dur="4.681">up a little bit but we saw this before</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="6.24">and then all of a sudden unemployment</text>
  <text start="180.75" dur="5.19">came skyrocketing down and we can see</text>
  <text start="184.14" dur="5.189">they are planning for the same thing</text>
  <text start="185.94" dur="5.909">most likely by September we will see an</text>
  <text start="189.329" dur="6.031">unemployment rate probably around five</text>
  <text start="191.849" dur="6.23">point nine percent now it seems it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.36" dur="5.79">getting more and more difficult for</text>
  <text start="198.079" dur="5.771">older workers they&amp;#39;re finding it very</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="4.83">tough as we know prices are continually</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="4.919">increasing or should I say the value of</text>
  <text start="205.98" dur="4.92">the dollar is decreasing making it look</text>
  <text start="208.769" dur="3.661">like the prices are increasing but</text>
  <text start="210.9" dur="4.08">what&amp;#39;s really happening is you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.43" dur="4.29">the value of your dollar is decreasing</text>
  <text start="214.98" dur="5.61">it takes more of your dollars to buy the</text>
  <text start="216.72" dur="8.04">same item and the older population who</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="6.509">have been retired need to find extra</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="4.86">work because their retirement is most</text>
  <text start="227.099" dur="5.521">likely fixed so they have to add on a</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="4.86">secondary job to make ends meet and what</text>
  <text start="232.62" dur="6.869">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that they&amp;#39;re pushing out</text>
  <text start="234.48" dur="8.189">those aged between 25 and 54 and the</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="4.801">population 55 and older are taking more</text>
  <text start="242.669" dur="5.281">and more of these part-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="5.849">they saw with these ages from 25 to 54</text>
  <text start="247.95" dur="5.25">about a hundred and forty-two thousand</text>
  <text start="250.139" dur="5.641">jobs declined in the past month because</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="3.96">the older population are going to take</text>
  <text start="255.78" dur="3.959">these jobs in there keeping them and</text>
  <text start="257.16" dur="4.71">some are even taking a secondary job</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="5.581">just to make ends meet because things</text>
  <text start="261.87" dur="5.549">are getting worse as time goes on now we</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="4.44">see out in the real estate market and as</text>
  <text start="267.419" dur="5.851">we know real estate is imploding on</text>
  <text start="269.76" dur="6.09">itself but construction spending plunged</text>
  <text start="273.27" dur="5.13">most since january of 2011 and we see</text>
  <text start="275.85" dur="7.74">right now that construction spending has</text>
  <text start="278.4" dur="8.64">reverted back to December of 2010 and</text>
  <text start="283.59" dur="7.67">where it&amp;#39;s a downward trajectory it is</text>
  <text start="287.04" dur="8.67">not going on going up the trend is down</text>
  <text start="291.26" dur="7.3">now it looks like the u.s. the EU are</text>
  <text start="295.71" dur="7.8">very concerned about the bricks becoming</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="9.35">a full-blown financial power and it is a</text>
  <text start="303.51" dur="7.5">serious factor in global political</text>
  <text start="307.91" dur="5.19">global politics the brick group of</text>
  <text start="311.01" dur="4.83">emerging economies is becoming a serious</text>
  <text start="313.1" dur="4.51">factor in global politics and the</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="4.71">European Union and the United States are</text>
  <text start="317.61" dur="5.34">very concerned on how fast this is</text>
  <text start="320.55" dur="5.4">growing and we knew this was going to</text>
  <text start="322.95" dur="5.01">happen we understood what was going on</text>
  <text start="325.95" dur="4.65">around the world we understand that the</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="4.68">dollar is collapsing it&amp;#39;s imploding on</text>
  <text start="330.6" dur="6.42">itself this is why we see all these</text>
  <text start="332.64" dur="6.21">flash points and war right looming on</text>
  <text start="337.02" dur="6.18">the horizon right now I should say and</text>
  <text start="338.85" dur="7.05">we can see that the BRIC nations wanted</text>
  <text start="343.2" dur="4.2">more voting power in the IMF the United</text>
  <text start="345.9" dur="3.69">States would not give that to them</text>
  <text start="347.4" dur="4.64">because they knew if they did the dollar</text>
  <text start="349.59" dur="5.91">would be finished so they decided to</text>
  <text start="352.04" dur="5.95">create their own brick bank to rival the</text>
  <text start="355.5" dur="5.07">IMF and we can see right now the BRIC</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="6.39">nations they all work together they have</text>
  <text start="360.57" dur="5.91">the same political agenda and right now</text>
  <text start="364.38" dur="5.04">they are starting to loan out money to</text>
  <text start="366.48" dur="4.23">build the emerging economies their</text>
  <text start="369.42" dur="3.96">infrastructure they&amp;#39;re building them up</text>
  <text start="370.71" dur="5.22">and we can see right now the EU and the</text>
  <text start="373.38" dur="5.79">US are very nervous about this and this</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="5.67">is why NATO United States have been</text>
  <text start="379.17" dur="4.56">building up military assets all across</text>
  <text start="381.6" dur="4.74">the world because they are preparing for</text>
  <text start="383.73" dur="4.89">war and we know they are preparing for</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="4.59">this because we can see the pivot to</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="4.58">Asia we see the amount of hardware that</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="5.04">is out in the Pacific we see NATO</text>
  <text start="393.2" dur="4.36">maneuvering all the hardware out in</text>
  <text start="395.97" dur="5.64">Eastern Europe bringing in more</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="6.51">sophisticated missile shield system and</text>
  <text start="401.61" dur="4.56">we can see they&amp;#39;ve been really propping</text>
  <text start="404.07" dur="3.21">up their military assets in central</text>
  <text start="406.17" dur="2.88">Africa and</text>
  <text start="407.28" dur="4.92">course the Middle East so we can see as</text>
  <text start="409.05" dur="5.43">I reported time after time more and more</text>
  <text start="412.2" dur="6.45">military assets have been being put into</text>
  <text start="414.48" dur="7.05">place now we see all over the news and</text>
  <text start="418.65" dur="6.36">we understand that there&amp;#39;s an Ebola</text>
  <text start="421.53" dur="5.639">break out and it&amp;#39;s plastered all over</text>
  <text start="425.01" dur="4.47">the corporate media and everyone is very</text>
  <text start="427.169" dur="5.671">very worried and I&amp;#39;m looking at this</text>
  <text start="429.48" dur="6.45">situation and it seems like this is</text>
  <text start="432.84" dur="5.31">really being pushed very hard I know the</text>
  <text start="435.93" dur="4.17">president just Sidon signed an executive</text>
  <text start="438.15" dur="5.55">order that anyone that has a respiratory</text>
  <text start="440.1" dur="5.43">or any type of breathing and other</text>
  <text start="443.7" dur="4.469">things you know they have to be looked</text>
  <text start="445.53" dur="5.01">at and this is turning into something</text>
  <text start="448.169" dur="6.241">that it seems like the central bankers</text>
  <text start="450.54" dur="6.39">the Obama administration they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="454.41" dur="4.68">to push this very very hard now I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="456.93" dur="4.26">saying this isn&amp;#39;t real I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="3.99">there aren&amp;#39;t cases but I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.19" dur="4.35">using this just like they use the swine</text>
  <text start="463.08" dur="5.309">flu way back they were trying to scare</text>
  <text start="465.54" dur="5.67">everyone and to see how everyone reacted</text>
  <text start="468.389" dur="4.681">and right now it seems like the Center</text>
  <text start="471.21" dur="5.25">for Disease Control has designated El</text>
  <text start="473.07" dur="5.25">Paso as one of 20 quarantine stations</text>
  <text start="476.46" dur="4.5">for the Ebola virus now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="478.32" dur="4.65">interesting they set up these CDC</text>
  <text start="480.96" dur="6.57">quarantine stations around the country</text>
  <text start="482.97" dur="7.56">and they pretty much match where Obama</text>
  <text start="487.53" dur="6.259">is sending the illegals there&amp;#39;s one sent</text>
  <text start="490.53" dur="6.24">up in Michigan Minnesota Minneapolis</text>
  <text start="493.789" dur="5.621">there&amp;#39;s one in Illinois Chicago there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="5.37">one in michigan detroit we see</text>
  <text start="499.41" dur="5.48">Massachusetts Boston New York is in new</text>
  <text start="502.14" dur="5.19">york and new jersey it&amp;#39;s in newark</text>
  <text start="504.89" dur="6.52">Pennsylvania&amp;#39;s Philadelphia Washington</text>
  <text start="507.33" dur="8.13">DC we&amp;#39;re seeing georgia atlanta florida</text>
  <text start="511.41" dur="5.7">is miami then we have Texas and North</text>
  <text start="515.46" dur="4.85">Texas there&amp;#39;s one in houston won in</text>
  <text start="517.11" dur="5.85">dallas and we see there&amp;#39;s one in El Paso</text>
  <text start="520.31" dur="6.4">there&amp;#39;s one in San Diego Los Angeles San</text>
  <text start="522.96" dur="7.11">Francisco and Seattle Washington so this</text>
  <text start="526.71" dur="5.76">is very similar to where all of the</text>
  <text start="530.07" dur="4.53">illegals are being sent which is very</text>
  <text start="532.47" dur="3.69">interesting of where they said where</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="4.02">they set up all these quarantine</text>
  <text start="536.16" dur="4.69">stations there are none in the Midwest</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="4.81">whatsoever which is</text>
  <text start="540.85" dur="5.539">very interesting now the World Health</text>
  <text start="543.43" dur="6.06">Organization warns Ebola a breakout is</text>
  <text start="546.389" dur="5.921">completely out of control and it&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="590.86" dur="4.529">that is a huge huge break out and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="593.829" dur="4.651">seen this once before but let me</text>
  <text start="595.389" dur="5.671">continue here the CDC issues alert to</text>
  <text start="598.48" dur="3.99">avoid unnecessary trips a problem with</text>

  <text start="607.81" dur="5.699">Health Organization spokesman in Geneva</text>
  <text start="610.209" dur="6.12">told everyone about this in his</text>
  <text start="613.509" dur="6.69">interview so if you are infected a week</text>
  <text start="616.329" dur="6.51">ago but you don&amp;#39;t have a fever or any</text>
  <text start="620.199" dur="5.521">other symptom yet you can fly and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="622.839" dur="5.641">not infectious you&amp;#39;re not a danger to</text>
  <text start="625.72" dur="5.28">anyone he said but the point is is</text>
  <text start="628.48" dur="4.08">saying that somebody could be carrying</text>
  <text start="631" dur="3.24">it but just not showing the signs so</text>
  <text start="632.56" dur="5.19">you&amp;#39;re allowed on the plane and you can</text>
  <text start="634.24" dur="5.64">fly wherever you want now when we look</text>
  <text start="637.75" dur="4.5">at this entire situation of what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="639.88" dur="5.009">on and we can see what is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="642.25" dur="6.019">happening this is what it can turn into</text>
  <text start="644.889" dur="6.481">and this is one predictable outcome</text>
  <text start="648.269" dur="4.841">clinics and hospitals frightened people</text>
  <text start="651.37" dur="4.889">who arrive with what they are labeled</text>
  <text start="653.11" dur="6.24">early signs of Ebola will be labeled as</text>
  <text start="656.259" dur="4.77">a probable case what are those symptoms</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="4.049">while it&amp;#39;s fever chills sore throat</text>
  <text start="661.029" dur="4.951">cough headache joint pain and that seems</text>

  <text start="1538.8" dur="4.08">when they had the draft and everyone</text>
  <text start="1540.42" dur="3.81">went in and burned their draft cards and</text>
  <text start="1542.88" dur="3.33">it seems like the same things happening</text>
  <text start="1544.23" dur="4.83">here they&amp;#39;re saying this is not our war</text>
  <text start="1546.21" dur="5.43">this is not our country and you are just</text>
  <text start="1549.06" dur="6.87">forcing us to do things we do not want</text>
  <text start="1551.64" dur="6.69">to do now we see today that Kiev has</text>
  <text start="1555.93" dur="5.1">come out with their satellite images and</text>
  <text start="1558.33" dur="4.47">it looks like Russia is debunking the</text>
  <text start="1561.03" dur="4.77">satellite images and when we take a</text>
  <text start="1562.8" dur="5.43">closer look at these images it does seem</text>
  <text start="1565.8" dur="5.25">a little suspicious and then we get more</text>
  <text start="1568.23" dur="5.55">confirmation that yes these images have</text>
  <text start="1571.05" dur="5.04">been doctored and they are made up</text>

  <text start="1587.04" dur="4.11">the tragedy and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="1589.32" dur="5.03">doing this they&amp;#39;re showing pictures of</text>
  <text start="1591.15" dur="5.46">things not at the time but after</text>
  <text start="1594.35" dur="3.94">remember back when they said the Russian</text>
  <text start="1596.61" dur="4.2">troops were building up on the border of</text>
  <text start="1598.29" dur="5.01">Russia and they showed a satellite</text>
  <text start="1600.81" dur="5.1">picture from NATO and it was proven that</text>
  <text start="1603.3" dur="5.49">it was taken from last year when they</text>
  <text start="1605.91" dur="4.59">were doing drills in that area the same</text>
  <text start="1608.79" dur="3.81">thing seems like it&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="1610.5" dur="3.75">now the defense ministry said the images</text>
  <text start="1612.6" dur="4.71">were apparently made by an American</text>
  <text start="1614.25" dur="6.65">keyhole reconnaissance satellite and how</text>
  <text start="1617.31" dur="7.98">do they notice well Ukrainian satellites</text>
  <text start="1620.9" dur="6.79">such one and such two were not above the</text>
  <text start="1625.29" dur="6.09">location at the time but the keyhole</text>
  <text start="1627.69" dur="7.38">reconnaissance satellite was so we can</text>
  <text start="1631.38" dur="6.54">see that all of this is completely fake</text>
  <text start="1635.07" dur="4.17">phony and false and the other thing when</text>
  <text start="1637.92" dur="4.38">they look at the satellite imagery is</text>
  <text start="1639.24" dur="5.58">that at the time when this whole</text>
  <text start="1642.3" dur="5.67">Malaysian airline plane was either hit</text>
  <text start="1644.82" dur="5.4">by the su-27 or missile and it looks</text>
  <text start="1647.97" dur="6.63">like it you know either story could be</text>
  <text start="1650.22" dur="7.02">right here if the weather patterns do</text>
  <text start="1654.6" dur="5.4">not match up with the satellite imagery</text>
  <text start="1657.24" dur="5.16">that Kiev is trying to push out there so</text>
  <text start="1660" dur="4.23">we can see right now the the weather</text>
  <text start="1662.4" dur="4.47">patterns and the cloud formation was</text>
  <text start="1664.23" dur="5.85">completely off their satellites weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1666.87" dur="5.4">above the area at the time and it was</text>
  <text start="1670.08" dur="4.65">only the u.s. satellites that were above</text>
  <text start="1672.27" dur="5.36">the area at the time so we can see right</text>
  <text start="1674.73" dur="5.94">now that it most likely was the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1677.63" dur="7.66">gave the satellite images a couple days</text>
  <text start="1680.67" dur="6.81">later pretty much you know rework the</text>
  <text start="1685.29" dur="4.38">imagery faked it just like they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1687.48" dur="4.59">doing and handed it off to Kiev and said</text>
  <text start="1689.67" dur="5.82">here turn this in and we can see right</text>
  <text start="1692.07" dur="5.82">now every time this happens things just</text>
  <text start="1695.49" dur="4.53">aren&amp;#39;t true it seems like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1697.89" dur="4.08">continually trying to push the lie and</text>
  <text start="1700.02" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re not stopping now they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1701.97" dur="6.63">to prove you know that they didn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="1704.25" dur="6.39">and of course we know they did now it</text>
  <text start="1708.6" dur="4.02">looks like the US Senate passed the</text>
  <text start="1710.64" dur="3.99">emergency funding for the Israeli Iron</text>
  <text start="1712.62" dur="4.53">Dome now and they&amp;#39;re going to give about</text>
  <text start="1714.63" dur="4.26">225 million in additional revenue to</text>
  <text start="1717.15" dur="4.32">Israel because they&amp;#39;re running out of</text>
  <text start="1718.89" dur="5.46">missiles and they need to replenish the</text>
  <text start="1721.47" dur="4.74">missile stock to continually strike down</text>
  <text start="1724.35" dur="6">the infrastructure and kill more</text>
  <text start="1726.21" dur="8.28">children and women now it seems like the</text>
  <text start="1730.35" dur="7.32">plan of the United States and Israel and</text>
  <text start="1734.49" dur="5.48">the UK and all the other private wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1737.67" dur="6.07">central bank countries it seems like</text>
  <text start="1739.97" dur="5.6">their plan was to divide Iraq and</text>
  <text start="1743.74" dur="4.95">actually spread this across the Middle</text>
  <text start="1745.57" dur="5.76">East to have a Kurd Sunni and Shiite</text>
  <text start="1748.69" dur="5.19">area and what&amp;#39;s very very interesting</text>
  <text start="1751.33" dur="5.46">all of a sudden the United States has</text>
  <text start="1753.88" dur="5.429">proposed a restructuring of the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="1756.79" dur="4.13">military officials said the</text>
  <text start="1759.309" dur="4.881">administration of President Barack Obama</text>
  <text start="1760.92" dur="5.86">drafted a plan to form an Iraqi military</text>
  <text start="1764.19" dur="3.79">limited to border operations the</text>
  <text start="1766.78" dur="4.92">officials said the military would</text>
  <text start="1767.98" dur="8.4">reflect the canonization of Iraq into</text>
  <text start="1771.7" dur="8.609">three separate enclaves sunni-shiite and</text>
  <text start="1776.38" dur="7.85">Kurdish and troops would be placed in</text>
  <text start="1780.309" dur="7.411">these areas that had to do with those uh</text>
  <text start="1784.23" dur="5.89">sex that were in that area so Sunni</text>
  <text start="1787.72" dur="4.05">people would get Sunni troops Shiite</text>
  <text start="1790.12" dur="4.08">people would get this Shiite troops and</text>
  <text start="1791.77" dur="4.77">the Kurds would get the curd troops and</text>
  <text start="1794.2" dur="4.41">they would like to start doing this and</text>
  <text start="1796.54" dur="4.59">this will take a couple months to a year</text>
  <text start="1798.61" dur="7.23">to really establish and we can see they</text>
  <text start="1801.13" dur="6.54">are paving the road to separate Iraq and</text>
  <text start="1805.84" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s going to be all other Middle</text>
  <text start="1807.67" dur="6.6">Eastern countries this is their plan</text>
  <text start="1810.13" dur="7.29">from the beginning to separate and put</text>
  <text start="1814.27" dur="5.06">each group into their own area so they</text>
  <text start="1817.42" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t have this type of fighting and</text>
  <text start="1819.33" dur="6.81">people rising up trying to take over the</text>
  <text start="1821.8" dur="8.49">countries will this work most likely not</text>
  <text start="1826.14" dur="6.91">now we understand from yesterday there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1830.29" dur="5.19">a informant who wants to remain</text>
  <text start="1833.05" dur="4.53">anonymous called Caesar who&amp;#39;s handing</text>
  <text start="1835.48" dur="4.31">out photos to Congress now but if we did</text>
  <text start="1837.58" dur="6.27">a little bit research we go back to</text>
  <text start="1839.79" dur="8.38">january2014 what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="1843.85" dur="6.6">caesar which was pretty much backed by</text>
  <text start="1848.17" dur="5.639">qatar and you have to remember qatar</text>
  <text start="1850.45" dur="6.18">just received a lot of military assets</text>
  <text start="1853.809" dur="6.591">and also we have to understand qatar was</text>
  <text start="1856.63" dur="8.01">training the syrian rebels to go into</text>
  <text start="1860.4" dur="7.57">Syria to fight Assad pretty much was</text>
  <text start="1864.64" dur="7.14">behind all this and this started before</text>
  <text start="1867.97" dur="6.36">the Geneva 2 talks this was put out</text>
  <text start="1871.78" dur="4.22">there where Caesar had all these</text>
  <text start="1874.33" dur="3.18">thousands of photos of people being</text>
  <text start="1876" dur="3.76">tortured</text>
  <text start="1877.51" dur="4.26">and how they were toward to Assad was</text>
  <text start="1879.76" dur="4.11">torturing his own people this was put</text>
  <text start="1881.77" dur="4.77">out there before the Geneva 2 talks to</text>
  <text start="1883.87" dur="5.01">try to push the talks in a certain</text>
  <text start="1886.54" dur="5.82">direction and have the UN come in and</text>
  <text start="1888.88" dur="6.48">say all right Assad was torturing his</text>
  <text start="1892.36" dur="4.77">people now Caesar is back but there are</text>
  <text start="1895.36" dur="4.59">a couple things about what is going on</text>
  <text start="1897.13" dur="5.25">here he&amp;#39;s supposed to be an insider</text>
  <text start="1899.95" dur="5.22">where he had inside access to pretty</text>
  <text start="1902.38" dur="6.65">much everything but the photos that he</text>
  <text start="1905.17" dur="6.72">is producing are from a hospital of</text>
  <text start="1909.03" dur="6.73">people who have been injured or who have</text>
  <text start="1911.89" dur="5.67">died now if he is an insider where are</text>
  <text start="1915.76" dur="3.66">the insider pictures because this is not</text>
  <text start="1917.56" dur="6.63">proof of anything this just shows people</text>
  <text start="1919.42" dur="7.23">in the hospital hurt and mangled and you</text>
  <text start="1924.19" dur="4.53">know people who were you know hit by</text>
  <text start="1926.65" dur="4.38">something it doesn&amp;#39;t prove who did it</text>
  <text start="1928.72" dur="4.94">because we have to remember from many</text>
  <text start="1931.03" dur="5.67">many videos we see the opposition</text>
  <text start="1933.66" dur="5.11">ripping out hearts we see the opposition</text>
  <text start="1936.7" dur="4.11">decapitating people we see the</text>
  <text start="1938.77" dur="5.04">opposition oh that&amp;#39;s right using sarin</text>
  <text start="1940.81" dur="4.41">gas on the people of Syria hey don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="1943.81" dur="3.78">see the same thing in Ukraine and the</text>
  <text start="1945.22" dur="4.98">same thing that Israel&amp;#39;s doing using</text>
  <text start="1947.59" dur="4.65">weapons of mass destruction just killing</text>
  <text start="1950.2" dur="4.5">people well the same thing here so</text>
  <text start="1952.24" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s red flag number one if he&amp;#39;s an</text>

  <text start="1957.4" dur="4.83">these prisons of these soldiers actually</text>
  <text start="1959.74" dur="5.58">doing it but guess what that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="1962.23" dur="5.04">these pictures are it&amp;#39;s not there these</text>
  <text start="1965.32" dur="7.26">pictures were taking in a military</text>
  <text start="1967.27" dur="8.16">hospital so the pictures are meaningless</text>
  <text start="1972.58" dur="4.77">it reminds me of the false flag event</text>
  <text start="1975.43" dur="4.77">when they showed the pictures of the</text>
  <text start="1977.35" dur="5.58">people being gassed in Syria it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1980.2" dur="5.93">proof it was the aftereffect of what</text>
  <text start="1982.93" dur="7.35">happened the proof is actually seeing</text>
  <text start="1986.13" dur="6.1">which side did it but the United States</text>
  <text start="1990.28" dur="3.84">government central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1992.23" dur="4.86">have that proof so they like to show</text>
  <text start="1994.12" dur="5.52">what happened afterwards and they use</text>
  <text start="1997.09" dur="4.71">this as their proof so they can work</text>
  <text start="1999.64" dur="5.49">backwards to pin it on whoever they</text>
  <text start="2001.8" dur="5.79">wanted and we saw this happen in August</text>
  <text start="2005.13" dur="4.83">of 2013 when they use the chemical false</text>
  <text start="2007.59" dur="3.719">flag attack and we found out that this</text>
  <text start="2009.96" dur="4.919">was completely fake phone</text>
  <text start="2011.309" dur="5.551">and it did not work and all these</text>
  <text start="2014.879" dur="4.62">pictures were taking on a digital camera</text>
  <text start="2016.86" dur="5.49">they were put on a USB there is like no</text>
  <text start="2019.499" dur="4.951">hard copies or anything like that and if</text>
  <text start="2022.35" dur="3.959">this person was truly an insider he</text>
  <text start="2024.45" dur="4.319">would have insider knowledge it would</text>
  <text start="2026.309" dur="4.71">have insider pictures and we would see</text>
  <text start="2028.769" dur="7.201">pictures like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before of</text>
  <text start="2031.019" dur="8.851">actual things going on now the Guardian</text>
  <text start="2035.97" dur="6.179">and other sources said yes these</text>
  <text start="2039.87" dur="4.35">pictures are definitely credible they</text>
  <text start="2042.149" dur="3.301">were not doctored well I&amp;#39;m sure they</text>
  <text start="2044.22" dur="3.51">weren&amp;#39;t and I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re real</text>
  <text start="2045.45" dur="6.84">pictures but it&amp;#39;s real pictures of just</text>
  <text start="2047.73" dur="6.869">people being hurt who have died in a</text>
