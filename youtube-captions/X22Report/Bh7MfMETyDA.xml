  <text start="64.86" dur="4.71">the episode is Russia and BRICS go after</text>
  <text start="67.619" dur="5.341">excessive domination of reserve</text>
  <text start="69.57" dur="6.81">currencies let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.96" dur="6.12">collapse financial news now yesterday we</text>
  <text start="76.38" dur="4.769">talked about how UBS was pushing towards</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="4.53">the blockchain they have this block</text>
  <text start="81.149" dur="4.26">train project and they&amp;#39;re getting many</text>
  <text start="83.61" dur="4.53">different banks involved and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="85.409" dur="6.421">seeing right now it&amp;#39;s going even further</text>
  <text start="88.14" dur="5.369">than that and there are the world&amp;#39;s six</text>
  <text start="91.83" dur="4.319">largest banks they&amp;#39;ve decided to join</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="4.801">the blockchain project called utility</text>
  <text start="96.149" dur="4.381">coin and that will allow the banks to</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="4.169">settle trades in securities denominated</text>
  <text start="100.53" dur="5.82">in different currencies without a money</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="6.241">transfer what&amp;#39;s worse the banks expect</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="4.799">to begin live testing the project late</text>
  <text start="108.72" dur="5.459">next year so they have already been</text>
  <text start="111.149" dur="4.89">working on this project now the banks</text>
  <text start="114.179" dur="3.84">that are involved in this are Barclays</text>
  <text start="116.039" dur="5.73">Credit Swiss Canadian Imperial Bank of</text>
  <text start="118.019" dur="5.761">Commerce HSBC mu F G and State Street</text>
  <text start="121.769" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;ve teamed up and they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="123.78" dur="6">with UBS and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="126.179" dur="5.67">about all of this is that the project</text>
  <text start="129.78" dur="4.38">managers say they&amp;#39;ve already involved</text>
  <text start="131.849" dur="5.341">representatives from various central</text>
  <text start="134.16" dur="5.579">banks so the central banks are already</text>
  <text start="137.19" dur="4.26">involved in this project which is</text>
  <text start="139.739" dur="3.571">already started they&amp;#39;ve already been</text>
  <text start="141.45" dur="3">doing the research and we could see</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="1.8">already they&amp;#39;re going to be ready for</text>
  <text start="144.45" dur="3.42">testing</text>
  <text start="145.11" dur="5.549">by next year and we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.87" dur="5.13">trying to get into the blockchain arena</text>
  <text start="150.659" dur="5.33">because we know what is happening right</text>
  <text start="153" dur="6.3">now the dollar reserve well that is</text>
  <text start="155.989" dur="5.64">going away and they&amp;#39;re getting prepared</text>
  <text start="159.3" dur="5.189">and ready to deal in the blockchain now</text>
  <text start="161.629" dur="5.771">using the blockchain they can use any</text>
  <text start="164.489" dur="5.761">type of currency that is out there they</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="5.82">can use Bitcoin they can use - they can</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="5.069">use litecoin they can use the euro or</text>
  <text start="173.22" dur="4.68">whenever whatever currency is out there</text>
  <text start="175.319" dur="3.631">they can use it to transfer back and</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="2.58">forth from the bank this is the</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="3.03">beginning stages and I think what</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="181.98" dur="5.1">push this even further where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="184.41" dur="2.94">gonna get deeper and deeper into the</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="1.98">blow</text>
  <text start="187.35" dur="2.88">change system because what they really</text>
  <text start="189.06" dur="3.09">want to do is they want to take control</text>
  <text start="190.23" dur="4.5">of this and let everyone know that yes</text>
  <text start="192.15" dur="4.68">you need the banks to handle this and</text>
  <text start="194.73" dur="4.41">this is why they are doing this right</text>
  <text start="196.83" dur="3.45">now so we can see at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.14" dur="3.15">making their move</text>
  <text start="200.28" dur="5.46">this project has been going on the</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="5.97">central banks are involved in it and we</text>
  <text start="205.74" dur="4.77">can see as the dollar deteriorates as</text>
  <text start="208.26" dur="4.17">the dollar declines as more and more</text>
  <text start="210.51" dur="3.36">countries stop using the dollar we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.43" dur="4.53">gonna see this pick up and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="213.87" dur="5.36">see more banks join today the jobs</text>
  <text start="216.96" dur="5.61">report came out and it was absolutely</text>
  <text start="219.23" dur="5.38">awful BLS reported that in August just a</text>
  <text start="222.57" dur="5.01">hundred and fifty six thousand jobs were</text>
  <text start="224.61" dur="7.56">created this is a huge miss they were</text>
  <text start="227.58" dur="7.05">expecting 180,000 gained and remember</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="4.89">the country is filled with millions and</text>
  <text start="234.63" dur="5.67">millions of people and you know getting</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="5.79">156 thousand or 180,000 or 200,000</text>
  <text start="240.3" dur="4.47">people to get jobs it&amp;#39;s really not that</text>
  <text start="242.85" dur="4.29">big of a number they want you to think</text>
  <text start="244.77" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s a really big number but it is tiny</text>
  <text start="247.14" dur="3.18">what&amp;#39;s very interesting though is that</text>
  <text start="249.12" dur="5.16">June and July</text>
  <text start="250.32" dur="7.35">they were revised down from 210 to 189</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="5.7">which is a 41,000 drop and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="257.67" dur="6.03">seeing is that the number of employed</text>
  <text start="259.98" dur="6.27">Americans declined by 74,000 which means</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="6.33">there are more and more people that are</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="5.61">out of work and remember that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="3.84">lot of retail stores they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="271.86" dur="3.54">closing not all of them have closed</text>
  <text start="273.87" dur="2.13">they&amp;#39;re in the process of closing down</text>
  <text start="275.4" dur="3.54">right now</text>
  <text start="276" dur="5.28">corporations are laying off and we can</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="4.44">see that the level drop by 1.2 percent</text>
  <text start="281.28" dur="4.56">this is the lowest since March now the</text>
  <text start="283.38" dur="7.02">unemployment rate ticked up a little bit</text>
  <text start="285.84" dur="7.07">to 4.4 percent and we see that average</text>
  <text start="290.4" dur="4.68">weekly earnings this has declined and</text>
  <text start="292.91" dur="5.23">basically what is happening here is that</text>
  <text start="295.08" dur="4.8">the employment arena is really going</text>
  <text start="298.14" dur="4.2">absolutely nowhere I mean they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="299.88" dur="4.65">manipulating this market for a very long</text>
  <text start="302.34" dur="4.5">time and we can see that pretty much</text>
  <text start="304.53" dur="5.01">employment is flatline flatline right</text>
  <text start="306.84" dur="4.89">now the labor participation rate really</text>
  <text start="309.54" dur="4.83">hasn&amp;#39;t gone anywhere we&amp;#39;re at the same</text>
  <text start="311.73" dur="6.23">exact level when we look back in time I</text>
  <text start="314.37" dur="6.06">mean we&amp;#39;re back at 1970 levels this is</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="3.1">absolutely awful and these aren&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="3.51">high pay</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="4.44">jobs these are terrible jobs now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="4.8">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="325.5" dur="5.55">that manufacturing employment somehow</text>
  <text start="328.74" dur="4.53">rose by thirty six thirty six thousand</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="7.35">jobs in August now let&amp;#39;s think about</text>
  <text start="333.27" dur="8.369">this because factories they are</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="6.84">furloughing workers motor vehicles and</text>
  <text start="341.639" dur="6.181">the part Department we can see this is</text>
  <text start="345.24" dur="4.32">not the best time of year where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="3.48">cutting back production</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="3.56">they&amp;#39;ve been channel stuffing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="4.17">nowhere else to place the cars and</text>
  <text start="353.12" dur="4.75">they&amp;#39;re telling us that manufacturing</text>
  <text start="355.47" dur="6.06">moved up which makes no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="357.87" dur="5.46">we see out in the housing market the US</text>
  <text start="361.53" dur="3.9">mortgage applications to buy home fell</text>
  <text start="363.33" dur="4.23">last week to their lowest level so the</text>
  <text start="365.43" dur="4.02">activity rate in people taking out</text>
  <text start="367.56" dur="3.81">mortgage applications that is</text>
  <text start="369.45" dur="4.11">continually falling and at the same time</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="4.74">that is happening we have the triple</text>
  <text start="373.56" dur="5.31">whammy which we have new homes that is</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="5.19">declining existing home sales that is</text>
  <text start="378.87" dur="4.82">declining pending home sales that is</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="6.36">declining and what else do we see well</text>
  <text start="383.69" dur="6.61">construction spending unexpectedly</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="4.17">declines now I like they they use they</text>
  <text start="390.3" dur="3.6">use that word unexpectedly to make it</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="3.899">like oh it&amp;#39;s a big surprise that this is</text>
  <text start="393.9" dur="4.139">happening but we could see right now</text>
  <text start="395.729" dur="4.651">that the consensus the Econo day</text>
  <text start="398.039" dur="6.151">consensus they were expecting it to move</text>
  <text start="400.38" dur="5.73">up by 0.6 percent instead it fell by 0.6</text>
  <text start="404.19" dur="4.17">percent and we can see this fits into</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="4.05">with every you know this whole thing</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="5.04">fits into what we&amp;#39;ve been saying the</text>
  <text start="410.16" dur="5.79">housing market is falling apart and we</text>
  <text start="413.4" dur="5.1">can definitely see this we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="415.95" dur="5.67">that new and existing homes the family</text>
  <text start="418.5" dur="5.43">formation it is weak and there is no</text>
  <text start="421.62" dur="4.71">strength in the housing market and the</text>
  <text start="423.93" dur="4.68">construction spending is extremely</text>
  <text start="426.33" dur="5.1">volatile right now and heavily revised</text>
  <text start="428.61" dur="5.46">actually it&amp;#39;s very suspect right now of</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="4.65">what&amp;#39;s really going on and when we look</text>
  <text start="434.07" dur="3.659">at the economy and we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="436.08" dur="3.75">about this for quite a while and we look</text>
  <text start="437.729" dur="4.741">at all these economic indicators we are</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="4.53">tracking every single day how the</text>
  <text start="442.47" dur="4.02">economy&amp;#39;s falling apart yes the</text>
  <text start="444.36" dur="4.29">corporate media is going to tell you how</text>
  <text start="446.49" dur="5.85">great the economy&amp;#39;s doing until the very</text>
  <text start="448.65" dur="5.28">end just like they did in 2008 they</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="2.49">never led on that there were major</text>
  <text start="453.93" dur="2.79">problems that</text>
  <text start="454.83" dur="3.75">deteriorating that these subprime</text>
  <text start="456.72" dur="3.78">securities were a joke they were</text>
  <text start="458.58" dur="3.63">defaulting they made it seem like</text>
  <text start="460.5" dur="3.84">everything was fine while the stock</text>
  <text start="462.21" dur="4.47">market&amp;#39;s going up it has to be okay the</text>
  <text start="464.34" dur="4.32">Fed told us that the housing market the</text>
  <text start="466.68" dur="4.29">subprime it&amp;#39;s contained housing prices</text>
  <text start="468.66" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t fall well we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="470.97" dur="4.92">everything and we know that this is not</text>
  <text start="473.01" dur="4.89">true now the corporate media the Fed</text>
  <text start="475.89" dur="3.87">even the US government is gonna tell you</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="4.62">that everything is fine what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="479.76" dur="5.25">looking at is how everything is</text>
  <text start="482.52" dur="4.92">completely deteriorating over time and</text>
  <text start="485.01" dur="6.24">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been saying is all</text>
  <text start="487.44" dur="6.54">been coming true if you go back to three</text>
  <text start="491.25" dur="5.04">years we said each year during the</text>
  <text start="493.98" dur="4.32">holiday season stores are going to do</text>
  <text start="496.29" dur="5.42">worse and worse and worse and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="498.3" dur="6.9">gonna see store closures here we are in</text>
  <text start="501.71" dur="5.32">2017 we said the housing market was</text>
  <text start="505.2" dur="3.66">going to start to fall apart it is</text>
  <text start="507.03" dur="3.84">falling apart we said the unemployment</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="4.59">numbers are completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="510.87" dur="5.58">false we know the GDP numbers forget</text>
  <text start="513.45" dur="4.47">that that is completely made-up and we</text>
  <text start="516.45" dur="3.42">know that manufacturing there&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="517.92" dur="5.31">not existing we told you that Amazon</text>
  <text start="519.87" dur="4.65">well even though the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="523.23" dur="3.03">telling you how great it is and</text>
  <text start="524.52" dur="4.74">everything is moving to online it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="526.26" dur="4.65">fake story they&amp;#39;re trying to pass this</text>
  <text start="529.26" dur="3.6">off because they can&amp;#39;t explain it away</text>
  <text start="530.91" dur="3.51">with the weather they can&amp;#39;t explain it</text>
  <text start="532.86" dur="2.88">away with anything else so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="4.52">saying is oh oh everyone&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="5.85">online and we debunked that myth</text>
  <text start="538.94" dur="5.5">everyone is not going online right now</text>
  <text start="541.59" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s only 10% of the entire retail</text>
  <text start="544.44" dur="5.16">market and Amazon is doing as good as</text>
  <text start="547.32" dur="5.19">its doing is because it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="549.6" dur="6.27">retail it&amp;#39;s their web service it&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="552.51" dur="5.49">cloud service it&amp;#39;s everything else so</text>
  <text start="555.87" dur="5.01">when we look at this we can see the</text>
  <text start="558" dur="6.12">entire system is falling apart now</text>
  <text start="560.88" dur="5.28">Russia China the other BRIC nations they</text>
  <text start="564.12" dur="3.93">know this they know everything is</text>
  <text start="566.16" dur="4.41">starting to fall apart and Russia wants</text>
  <text start="568.05" dur="5.1">to promote economic cooperation within</text>
  <text start="570.57" dur="4.47">the BRICS format now according to Putin</text>
  <text start="573.15" dur="3.84">there has been a number of practical</text>
  <text start="575.04" dur="4.08">achievements in the work of the five</text>
  <text start="576.99" dur="4.47">nation bloc in an open letter published</text>
  <text start="579.12" dur="5.28">ahead of the ninth BRICS summit in China</text>
  <text start="581.46" dur="5.19">Putin expressed confidence the BRICS</text>
  <text start="584.4" dur="4.08">countries will continue to act against</text>
  <text start="586.65" dur="5.999">protectionism and</text>
  <text start="588.48" dur="6.87">new barriers to global trade and this</text>

  <text start="598.23" dur="4.26">join in on this and they don&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="600.66" dur="3.419">basically they&amp;#39;re going up against the</text>
  <text start="602.49" dur="2.27">United States they&amp;#39;re going up against</text>
  <text start="604.079" dur="4.051">the dollar</text>

  <text start="608.13" dur="5.209">countries concerns over the unfairness</text>
  <text start="610.709" dur="5.611">of global financial and economic</text>
  <text start="613.339" dur="4.81">architecture which does not give due</text>
