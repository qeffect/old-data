  <text start="234.519" dur="3">thank you very much for joining it now</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="5.04">think about what he&amp;#39;s saying here he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.519" dur="5.641">going to drain the swamp isn&amp;#39;t this what</text>
  <text start="240.82" dur="4.77">Trump is doing isn&amp;#39;t this what other</text>
  <text start="243.16" dur="4.92">leaders around the world are going to do</text>
  <text start="245.59" dur="5.07">think about Italy think about Australia</text>
  <text start="248.08" dur="4.83">think about France with lepen coming</text>
  <text start="250.66" dur="5.569">into office think about Angela Merkel</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="6.63">who is stepping down it is happening and</text>
  <text start="256.229" dur="5.561">the economic structure is about to</text>
  <text start="259.54" dur="6.71">change because when you change the</text>
  <text start="261.79" dur="8.82">government and you get rid of the swamp</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="7.21">amazing things happen and when I say</text>
  <text start="270.61" dur="5.43">amazing I mean these individuals they</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="5.49">are not corrupt or they haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="276.04" dur="4.26">corrupted yet and they will be able to</text>
  <text start="278.95" dur="3.18">say you know something this is not good</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="4.2">for the people we don&amp;#39;t want to go along</text>
  <text start="282.13" dur="5.789">with this and you have a completely</text>
  <text start="284.5" dur="8.58">different outlook on how everything is</text>
  <text start="287.919" dur="7.951">run and I believe we are in that time</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="4.26">frame where everything is about to</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="3.66">change</text>
  <text start="297.34" dur="4.41">and actually this is the perfect time</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="5.75">frame why because the central bank</text>
  <text start="301.75" dur="6.78">system it is imploding on itself and</text>
  <text start="305.28" dur="5.38">they are completely exposed even on the</text>
  <text start="308.53" dur="3.359">mainstream media the deep state the</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="3.99">central bank they&amp;#39;re trying to make it</text>
  <text start="311.889" dur="6">seem like well it&amp;#39;s the tariffs well the</text>
  <text start="314.65" dur="4.35">economy is too strong it is not going to</text>
  <text start="317.889" dur="3.631">work I won&amp;#39;t be talking about that in</text>
  <text start="319" dur="5.669">just a minute now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="321.52" dur="5.01">central bank system we can see how bad</text>
  <text start="324.669" dur="4.081">it is and it&amp;#39;s really not that hard to</text>
  <text start="326.53" dur="4.8">figure out we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this for</text>
  <text start="328.75" dur="5.15">a very long time and the central bank</text>
  <text start="331.33" dur="4.89">system is really easy to figure out</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="5.23">listen you lower the interest rates</text>
  <text start="336.22" dur="4.98">housing does better you add stimulus</text>
  <text start="339.13" dur="4.64">housing does even better you pump up</text>
  <text start="341.2" dur="5.58">bubbles you control the stock market you</text>
  <text start="343.77" dur="6.75">have other central banks buying stocks</text>
  <text start="346.78" dur="6">you pump it up the economy looks great</text>
  <text start="350.52" dur="6.22">manipulate the unemployment numbers and</text>
  <text start="352.78" dur="7.199">everyone thinks everything is fine then</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="7.41">if you raise the rates and you tighten</text>
  <text start="359.979" dur="6.331">and you taper off the stimulus what</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="4.59">happens the housing market falls apart</text>
  <text start="366.31" dur="4.31">if you don&amp;#39;t pump up the stock market if</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="4.2">you don&amp;#39;t have other central banks</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="4.24">purchase that if they&amp;#39;re not purchasing</text>
  <text start="372.94" dur="4.53">the stocks what happens to the stock</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="5.22">market it completely falls apart if you</text>
  <text start="377.47" dur="5.1">get rid of high-frequency trading what</text>
  <text start="380.08" dur="4.95">happens to the stock market basically if</text>
  <text start="382.57" dur="6.39">you allow the system to be an open free</text>
  <text start="385.03" dur="6.96">market it falls apart the central bank</text>
  <text start="388.96" dur="5.85">has been controlling the entire economic</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="4.29">system to make us believe that this is</text>
  <text start="394.81" dur="2.78">normal now remember we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="396.28" dur="4.68">brainwashed for a very long time</text>
  <text start="397.59" dur="6.009">thinking that debt is good more debt is</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="5.85">even better and being in debt is</text>
  <text start="403.599" dur="5.79">fantastic that&amp;#39;s not how it is</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re also been brainwashing to think</text>
  <text start="409.389" dur="6.78">that inflation is normal yes under a</text>
  <text start="412.45" dur="6.24">central bank system it is normal but if</text>
  <text start="416.169" dur="7.5">you remove the central bank you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="418.69" dur="7.65">have inflation hmm very interesting now</text>
  <text start="423.669" dur="5.641">when we look at the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="426.34" dur="4.799">we look at pending homes we see that</text>
  <text start="429.31" dur="3.93">they have suffered the worst</text>
  <text start="431.139" dur="4.951">decline streak since the financial</text>
  <text start="433.24" dur="4.829">crisis and it is not getting better</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="4.56">because what has the central bank done</text>
  <text start="438.069" dur="5.07">it has raised rates since Trump came</text>
  <text start="440.65" dur="5.37">into office yes recently they&amp;#39;ve stopped</text>
  <text start="443.139" dur="5.791">raising rates but remember the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.02" dur="4.829">like a big ship it just doesn&amp;#39;t turn on</text>
  <text start="448.93" dur="5.16">a dime it takes a little while for</text>
  <text start="450.849" dur="6.06">everything to move and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="454.09" dur="5.069">right now is what has been happening to</text>
  <text start="456.909" dur="4.59">the economy while the central bank has</text>
  <text start="459.159" dur="5.07">been tapering cutting off stimulus and</text>
  <text start="461.499" dur="6.241">raising rates the housing market is</text>
  <text start="464.229" dur="5.641">declining if we look at the pending</text>
  <text start="467.74" dur="5.13">homes in the in the North East they fell</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="6.329">by 1.8% if we look at the Midwest that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.87" dur="6.349">1.3 percent the South is down by 2.5</text>
  <text start="476.199" dur="5.22">percent the West is down by 1.8% and</text>
  <text start="479.219" dur="4.151">what Trump needs to do at this point</text>
  <text start="481.419" dur="6.631">which I do believe he&amp;#39;s going to do very</text>
  <text start="483.37" dur="7.259">very soon he&amp;#39;s going to push the Federal</text>
  <text start="488.05" dur="4.589">Reserve to cut interest rates he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="490.629" dur="6.63">to push the Federal Reserve to start</text>
  <text start="492.639" dur="6.691">stimulus and look all these economists</text>
  <text start="497.259" dur="3.84">the mainstream media the central bank</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="3.42">and all of them they thought the first</text>
  <text start="501.099" dur="2.69">quarter of this year is going to be</text>
  <text start="502.75" dur="4.58">horrible</text>
  <text start="503.789" dur="5.261">because of everything that was happening</text>
  <text start="507.33" dur="4.63">guess what happened</text>
  <text start="509.05" dur="4.979">Trump had the magic one GDP number was</text>
  <text start="511.96" dur="4.949">at 3.2 percent yes they revised it</text>
  <text start="514.029" dur="5.67">recently down to 3.1 percent but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="516.909" dur="5">still above their expectations they</text>
  <text start="519.699" dur="4.651">can&amp;#39;t figure out how he&amp;#39;s doing this</text>
  <text start="521.909" dur="4.331">well they know how he&amp;#39;s doing this but</text>
  <text start="524.35" dur="3.57">they can&amp;#39;t let everyone know because</text>
  <text start="526.24" dur="4.5">this is the same thing they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="527.92" dur="6.27">doing for years and it&amp;#39;s really not that</text>
  <text start="530.74" dur="4.89">difficult to figure out now Trump is out</text>
  <text start="534.19" dur="3.87">there and he&amp;#39;s saying the United States</text>
  <text start="535.63" dur="5.51">they are doing very well</text>
  <text start="538.06" dur="5.7">with the trade talks with China and</text>
  <text start="541.14" dur="4.75">Beijing wants to make a deal</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="4.23">he said China would love to make a deal</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="4.379">with us we had a deal and they broke the</text>
  <text start="547.99" dur="5.039">deal I think if they had it to do it</text>
  <text start="550.269" dur="5.13">again they wouldn&amp;#39;t have done what they</text>
  <text start="553.029" dur="5.101">did Trump said the tariffs on Chinese</text>
  <text start="555.399" dur="4.591">goods were prompting manufacturers in</text>
  <text start="558.13" dur="4.75">China to leave the country and locate in</text>
  <text start="559.99" dur="5.71">two other nations he also said that</text>
  <text start="562.88" dur="5.04">China is subsidizing products so the</text>
  <text start="565.7" dur="5.25">United States taxpayers are paying for</text>
  <text start="567.92" dur="5.28">very little of it noting that the</text>
  <text start="570.95" dur="4.08">tariffs had little impact on inflation</text>
  <text start="573.2" dur="3.96">and he went on to say I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="575.03" dur="5.01">doing very well with China and I do</text>
  <text start="577.16" dur="5.28">believe that China well they&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="580.04" dur="4.77">cornered right now and they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="4.32">to realize that there&amp;#39;s no other</text>
  <text start="584.81" dur="3.96">individual coming into the White House</text>
  <text start="586.76" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re going to have to deal with China</text>
  <text start="588.77" dur="4.14">they tried all their maneuvers they</text>
  <text start="590.99" dur="4.32">tried all the different tactics but I</text>
  <text start="592.91" dur="4.32">think Trump has cornered them they</text>
  <text start="595.31" dur="4.74">realize it and I do believe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.23" dur="4.38">going to make a deal I kind of believe</text>
  <text start="600.05" dur="3.45">that they&amp;#39;ve made a deal already but</text>
  <text start="601.61" dur="3.51">Trump is dragging this out and they</text>
  <text start="603.5" dur="4.68">really don&amp;#39;t want to announce anything</text>
  <text start="605.12" dur="4.8">as of yet but we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this</text>
  <text start="608.18" dur="4.05">all plays out and I do believe there</text>
  <text start="609.92" dur="5.28">will be a deal and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="612.23" dur="5.34">Trump right now is keeping this up to</text>
  <text start="615.2" dur="5.1">have the central bank system continually</text>
  <text start="617.57" dur="4.98">call out the tariffs as the problem and</text>
  <text start="620.3" dur="4.44">we know that this isn&amp;#39;t the problem</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="4.41">because once the tariffs are removed</text>
  <text start="624.74" dur="6.84">once there&amp;#39;s a deal with China the</text>
  <text start="626.96" dur="7.86">central bank system the IMF the ECB the</text>
  <text start="631.58" dur="6.48">Fed and the rest they don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="634.82" dur="7.47">type of an excuse how are they going to</text>
  <text start="638.06" dur="7.91">explain how the global economy is</text>
  <text start="642.29" dur="6.24">continually declining it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="645.97" dur="5.32">the only thing that does make sense is</text>

  <text start="651.29" dur="4.32">what they&amp;#39;ve done for the many many</text>
  <text start="653.45" dur="5.4">years they&amp;#39;re the ones who are</text>
  <text start="655.61" dur="5.16">responsible for destroying this economy</text>
  <text start="658.85" dur="3.84">now like I said in the beginning the</text>
  <text start="660.77" dur="4.56">mainstream media the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="662.69" dur="5.16">trying to make it seem like the economy</text>
  <text start="665.33" dur="5.82">is under stress and this is at a</text>
  <text start="667.85" dur="3.93">Bloomberg there headline is the economy</text>
  <text start="671.15" dur="4.47">is booming</text>
  <text start="671.78" dur="6.24">so is financial stress and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.62" dur="4.74">trying to make it seem like well this</text>
  <text start="678.02" dur="5.76">can&amp;#39;t go on forever this incredible</text>
  <text start="680.36" dur="5.85">economy it&amp;#39;s going to fall apart well we</text>
  <text start="683.78" dur="4.89">know it&amp;#39;s fake and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="686.21" dur="5.49">make the case and they&amp;#39;re hoping that it</text>
  <text start="688.67" dur="5.94">completely implodes on itself but again</text>
  <text start="691.7" dur="3.73">Trump is in control the Patriots are in</text>
  <text start="694.61" dur="3.76">control</text>
  <text start="695.43" dur="5.79">and we&amp;#39;re not going to see the entire</text>
  <text start="698.37" dur="5.04">system fall apart like we&amp;#39;ve seen in the</text>
  <text start="701.22" dur="5.43">past because these were coordinated</text>
  <text start="703.41" dur="5.81">efforts to bring down the economy it was</text>
  <text start="706.65" dur="4.92">planned by the central bank&amp;#39;s system</text>
  <text start="709.22" dur="7.12">because once they have the economy come</text>
  <text start="711.57" dur="8.01">down they are able to ask for more</text>
  <text start="716.34" dur="5.19">control they can ask for stimulus they</text>
  <text start="719.58" dur="3.9">can say we want to lower the rates and</text>
  <text start="721.53" dur="4.35">guess what Congress will say go ahead</text>
  <text start="723.48" dur="3.89">and it&amp;#39;ll seem like well they have to do</text>
  <text start="725.88" dur="4.98">this if they need to save the economy</text>
  <text start="727.37" dur="6.13">these type of booms and busts they are</text>
  <text start="730.86" dur="5.52">always planned so the central bank gets</text>
  <text start="733.5" dur="6.21">more and more control now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="736.38" dur="6.32">interesting is that Powell now is doing</text>
  <text start="739.71" dur="6.81">the same thing as what Bernanke did in</text>
  <text start="742.7" dur="6.61">2007 and remember when Bernanke was out</text>
  <text start="746.52" dur="4.56">there and he said at this juncture</text>
  <text start="749.31" dur="3.42">however the impact on the broader</text>
  <text start="751.08" dur="3.75">economy and financial market to the</text>
  <text start="752.73" dur="4.83">problems in the subprime market seems</text>
  <text start="754.83" dur="4.71">likely to be contained given the</text>
  <text start="757.56" dur="3.48">fundamental factors in place that should</text>
  <text start="759.54" dur="3.12">support the demand for housing we</text>
  <text start="761.04" dur="3.51">believe the effect of the troubles in</text>
  <text start="762.66" dur="4.31">the subprime sector on the broader</text>
  <text start="764.55" dur="5.61">housing market will likely be limited</text>
  <text start="766.97" dur="5.04">and it was the worst financial crisis</text>
  <text start="770.16" dur="4.32">that we&amp;#39;ve seen well</text>
  <text start="772.01" dur="5.71">Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell</text>
  <text start="774.48" dur="6.99">is doing the same thing now again is</text>
  <text start="777.72" dur="7.89">this being done on purpose and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="781.47" dur="8.13">saying now is that the debt levels they</text>
  <text start="785.61" dur="6.54">are contained and Drone Powell said the</text>
  <text start="789.6" dur="4.53">following to preview my conclusions as</text>
  <text start="792.15" dur="4.17">of now business that does not present</text>
  <text start="794.13" dur="3.84">the kind of elevated risk to the</text>
  <text start="796.32" dur="4.47">stability of the financial system that</text>
  <text start="797.97" dur="5.15">would lead to broad harm to households</text>
  <text start="800.79" dur="5.13">and businesses should conditions</text>
  <text start="803.12" dur="6.46">deteriorate in other words the corporate</text>
  <text start="805.92" dur="6.36">debt is contained well guess what the</text>
  <text start="809.58" dur="5.85">government debt the corporate debt the</text>
  <text start="812.28" dur="5.85">worldwide debt it is not contained and</text>
  <text start="815.43" dur="5.21">he&amp;#39;s going down the same track as</text>
  <text start="818.13" dur="7.91">Bernanke now during this period of time</text>
  <text start="820.64" dur="8.2">during the 2008 crisis 2009 crisis</text>
  <text start="826.04" dur="3.099">Bernanke was saying that there was going</text>
  <text start="828.84" dur="3.39">to be</text>
  <text start="829.139" dur="4.5">no recession they&amp;#39;re forecasting nothing</text>
  <text start="832.23" dur="3.319">everything is contained everything is</text>
  <text start="833.639" dur="5.25">fine and then when everything fell apart</text>
  <text start="835.549" dur="5.44">they blamed speculators they blamed</text>
  <text start="838.889" dur="4.17">everyone else now Powell is doing the</text>
  <text start="840.989" dur="4.95">same thing but with debt and I do</text>
  <text start="843.059" dur="5.34">believe this is another area where</text>
  <text start="845.939" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re setting up the central bank to</text>
  <text start="848.399" dur="6.75">take the blame and you can see that</text>
  <text start="852.239" dur="6.33">Trump he tells the central bank listen</text>
  <text start="855.149" dur="5.67">we need to pause the rates we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="858.569" dur="5.31">raise them any longer the Federal</text>
  <text start="860.819" dur="4.74">Reserve listens Trump says maybe we need</text>
  <text start="863.879" dur="3.48">a little bit of stimulus the central</text>
  <text start="865.559" dur="4.62">bank says ok we&amp;#39;ll stop tightening and</text>
  <text start="867.359" dur="3.9">maybe we&amp;#39;ll start simulate stimulus of</text>
  <text start="870.179" dur="3.87">course they&amp;#39;re gonna call it something</text>
  <text start="871.259" dur="4.56">different but they&amp;#39;re listening to what</text>
  <text start="874.049" dur="3.57">Trump says now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="875.819" dur="4.19">independent they&amp;#39;re not really listening</text>
  <text start="877.619" dur="5.13">to him well of course they are and</text>
  <text start="880.009" dur="6.73">they&amp;#39;re doing exactly what he wants and</text>
  <text start="882.749" dur="6.57">he&amp;#39;s gonna put pressure on them to start</text>
  <text start="886.739" dur="5.01">the stimulus and lower rates and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="889.319" dur="5.82">gonna come during the later part of this</text>
  <text start="891.749" dur="6.541">summer moving into fall going into 2020</text>
  <text start="895.139" dur="5.79">and this has to be done because if it is</text>
  <text start="898.29" dur="5.609">not the system will implode on itself</text>
  <text start="900.929" dur="5.671">and I do believe everything that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="903.899" dur="5.461">seeing right now is part of the plan to</text>
  <text start="906.6" dur="5.849">set up the central bank system to take</text>
  <text start="909.36" dur="6.389">the fall to expose them to the world</text>
  <text start="912.449" dur="6.42">saying they are responsible for the</text>
  <text start="915.749" dur="5.67">economic system coming down and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.869" dur="7.08">starting to see that countries will</text>
  <text start="921.419" dur="9.691">start to back this think about when the</text>
  <text start="925.949" dur="8.521">UK moves away from the EU think about</text>
  <text start="931.11" dur="7.259">Italy then think about France think</text>
  <text start="934.47" dur="6.449">about Greece think about Australia think</text>
  <text start="938.369" dur="5.3">about everyone that is looking at this</text>
  <text start="940.919" dur="5.85">and what they&amp;#39;re going to do next</text>
  <text start="943.669" dur="5.44">especially when Trump continually points</text>
  <text start="946.769" dur="5.01">the finger at the central bank system</text>
  <text start="949.109" dur="4.92">and I do believe this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="951.779" dur="5.01">coordinated effort I do believe that</text>
  <text start="954.029" dur="5.21">China Russia the United States of course</text>
  <text start="956.789" dur="5.311">Angela Merkel has lump them all together</text>
  <text start="959.239" dur="3.891">they are going to take out the central</text>
  <text start="962.1" dur="4.04">bank system</text>
  <text start="963.13" dur="4.72">think about it if the United States I</text>
  <text start="966.14" dur="4.259">know some people are saying it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="967.85" dur="4.429">have gold spoke to Jim Willie did an</text>
  <text start="970.399" dur="4.891">interview he&amp;#39;s saying the goal was found</text>
  <text start="972.279" dur="6.731">if the United States does have this gold</text>
  <text start="975.29" dur="7.32">think about how much gold China Russia</text>
  <text start="979.01" dur="5.94">and the United States have do you think</text>
  <text start="982.61" dur="3.419">they have enough here and I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="984.95" dur="4.02">other countries don&amp;#39;t get me wrong</text>
  <text start="986.029" dur="6.391">there&amp;#39;s India there&amp;#39;s Switzerland and</text>
  <text start="988.97" dur="6.72">many other countries do you think</text>
  <text start="992.42" dur="7.35">there&amp;#39;s enough gold there to build</text>
  <text start="995.69" dur="7.44">confidence to move away from the central</text>
  <text start="999.77" dur="5.61">bank system I do believe so think about</text>
  <text start="1003.13" dur="4.709">the manipulation think about what</text>
  <text start="1005.38" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;ve done to bring the precious metal</text>
  <text start="1007.839" dur="6.031">prices down do I think this is going to</text>
  <text start="1011.14" dur="5.58">be a coordinated effort it has to be</text>
  <text start="1013.87" dur="4.95">this is the only way we can get rid of a</text>
  <text start="1016.72" dur="5.489">global central bank system and I think</text>
  <text start="1018.82" dur="6.21">in the end all these leaders are going</text>
  <text start="1022.209" dur="4.771">to work to get rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="1025.03" dur="4.35">system because the central bank is not</text>

  <text start="1029.38" dur="5.459">good for China the central bank is not</text>
  <text start="1032.17" dur="5.279">good for any country because in the end</text>
