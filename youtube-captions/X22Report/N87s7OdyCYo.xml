  <text start="139" dur="4.709">anywhere but they&amp;#39;re gonna keep throwing</text>
  <text start="140.44" dur="5.129">all of this stuff at Trump because they</text>
  <text start="143.709" dur="4.021">have nothing left the Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="145.569" dur="3.871">thing completely fell apart even though</text>

  <text start="149.44" dur="2.7">has nothing to do with Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="150.94" dur="2.67">yes I know the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="152.14" dur="3.12">playing it up they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="153.61" dur="2.34">pushing it as hard as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="155.26" dur="2.94">because think about it</text>
  <text start="155.95" dur="4.35">go back in time when they were telling</text>
  <text start="158.2" dur="4.11">everyone about the Russian collusion how</text>
  <text start="160.3" dur="4.74">they have all this evidence they have</text>
  <text start="162.31" dur="4.83">the investigative team they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="165.04" dur="4.14">into it they have all this information</text>
  <text start="167.14" dur="2.519">and it turned out to be what oh that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.18" dur="3.12">right</text>
  <text start="169.659" dur="5.371">nothing the same thing is happening once</text>
  <text start="172.3" dur="6.51">again they&amp;#39;re throwing everything at it</text>
  <text start="175.03" dur="6.269">all at once to try to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="178.81" dur="4.14">that they have something but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="181.299" dur="4.231">going to work right now and as we can</text>
  <text start="182.95" dur="2.83">see things are rapidly falling apart for</text>
  <text start="185.53" dur="2.68">the</text>
  <text start="185.78" dur="5.43">and they need to push every single</text>
  <text start="188.21" dur="4.32">agenda right now or they are completely</text>
  <text start="191.21" dur="4.8">done pretty soon they&amp;#39;re gonna be on the</text>
  <text start="192.53" dur="7.02">run and we&amp;#39;re gonna see investigators</text>
  <text start="196.01" dur="6.03">we&amp;#39;re gonna see Senate hearings we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.55" dur="4.77">gonna see all this happen against all</text>
  <text start="202.04" dur="4.14">these individuals and they know this if</text>
  <text start="204.32" dur="4.02">they don&amp;#39;t do anything at this point</text>
  <text start="206.18" dur="4.59">they are going to be caught up in this</text>
  <text start="208.34" dur="4.53">and even this these articles of</text>
  <text start="210.77" dur="5.97">impeachment this has to go through a</text>
  <text start="212.87" dur="6.24">lengthy process I mean it has to go to</text>
  <text start="216.74" dur="4.469">the House Judiciary Committee&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="219.11" dur="3.75">have to vote on it if that passes it has</text>
  <text start="221.209" dur="4.681">to go to the House of Representative if</text>
  <text start="222.86" dur="6.3">that passes then they have to it has to</text>
  <text start="225.89" dur="4.77">be brought to the Senate and then it has</text>
  <text start="229.16" dur="3.06">to go to the Senate and then the</text>
  <text start="230.66" dur="3.24">Senators have to inform the president</text>
  <text start="232.22" dur="3.75">they have to write the bill of</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="4.44">indictment and then they have to go to</text>
  <text start="235.97" dur="4.35">trial so this is not like oh let&amp;#39;s file</text>
  <text start="238.34" dur="4.77">the articles impeachment and tomorrow</text>
  <text start="240.32" dur="6.06">he&amp;#39;s impeached this is a long drawn-out</text>
  <text start="243.11" dur="5.34">process and it&amp;#39;s really for publicity</text>
  <text start="246.38" dur="4.169">right now to make it look really good</text>
  <text start="248.45" dur="3.24">like he&amp;#39;s getting impeach but you can</text>
  <text start="250.549" dur="2.731">see all the other articles of</text>
  <text start="251.69" dur="3.6">impeachment they&amp;#39;re just sitting there</text>
  <text start="253.28" dur="4.44">they haven&amp;#39;t gone anywhere because</text>
  <text start="255.29" dur="4.199">there&amp;#39;s nothing behind it there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="257.72" dur="3.15">grounds and of course what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="259.489" dur="3.561">is they&amp;#39;re working with constitutional</text>
  <text start="260.87" dur="5.19">lawyers to try to dig up something</text>
  <text start="263.05" dur="4.99">because they have nothing and when you</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="3.45">have nothing you have to keep digging</text>
  <text start="268.04" dur="3.51">and digging and digging to find one</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="3.659">little tiny thing and even if they find</text>
  <text start="271.55" dur="2.79">the one little tiny thing it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="273.169" dur="2.701">really going to make a difference</text>
  <text start="274.34" dur="6.26">because if you have to dig that hard</text>
  <text start="275.87" dur="8.16">there&amp;#39;s a problem we see out in the UK</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="5.8">Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has</text>
  <text start="284.03" dur="4.949">conceded that there is no evidence of</text>
  <text start="286.4" dur="5.579">Russia has ever sought to interfere with</text>
  <text start="288.979" dur="5.731">the British votes now think about it the</text>
  <text start="291.979" dur="4.981">whole hacking of the election system</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="5.67">here in the United States that was fake</text>
  <text start="296.96" dur="6.39">phony and false out in the UK the same</text>
  <text start="300.38" dur="7.16">thing fake phony and false all of this</text>
  <text start="303.35" dur="8.879">is falling apart very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="307.54" dur="7.27">the Cabal is in trouble and the only way</text>
  <text start="312.229" dur="6.69">out of all this is either to run and</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="4.8">hide and just say ok we&amp;#39;re gone but as</text>
  <text start="318.919" dur="3.451">we know</text>
  <text start="319.61" dur="5.579">they never give up they work very very</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="4.769">hard throughout all these years to set</text>
  <text start="325.189" dur="4.5">up what they have they&amp;#39;re not just gonna</text>
  <text start="327.139" dur="4.83">give it up they&amp;#39;d rather blow it up then</text>
  <text start="329.689" dur="5.211">give it up and this is what we need to</text>
  <text start="331.969" dur="7.111">be nervous about we see there was a new</text>
  <text start="334.9" dur="6.75">survey by the Cato Institute and the</text>
  <text start="339.08" dur="5.73">survey was the Cato 2017 free speech and</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="7.269">tolerance survey and they pulled around</text>
  <text start="344.81" dur="5.579">2,300 US adults and 71% of Americans</text>
  <text start="348.919" dur="4.351">believe that the political correctness</text>
  <text start="350.389" dur="5.791">has silenced important discussions our</text>
  <text start="353.27" dur="5.34">society needs to have now the reason for</text>
  <text start="356.18" dur="7.289">political correctness is to control your</text>
  <text start="358.61" dur="7.079">speech to control what you say and this</text>
  <text start="363.469" dur="4.41">is what the establishment the Cabal the</text>
  <text start="365.689" dur="3.78">deep state uses to control people</text>
  <text start="367.879" dur="3.84">because once they can control what you</text>
  <text start="369.469" dur="4.26">say you no longer have free speech if</text>
  <text start="371.719" dur="4.41">anyone has seen the giver you will know</text>
  <text start="373.729" dur="4.021">that there was a precision of language</text>
  <text start="376.129" dur="3.63">where you couldn&amp;#39;t say certain words or</text>
  <text start="377.75" dur="5.58">certain words meant something else and</text>
  <text start="379.759" dur="5.431">they controlled exactly what you did</text>
  <text start="383.33" dur="4.649">this is what they were trying to do here</text>
  <text start="385.19" dur="5.55">with political correctness yes it sounds</text>
  <text start="387.979" dur="4.201">great on the surface oh we have to be</text>
  <text start="390.74" dur="3.69">correct we can&amp;#39;t hurt people&amp;#39;s feelings</text>
  <text start="392.18" dur="4.53">we can&amp;#39;t say that word this word and</text>
  <text start="394.43" dur="6.299">what happens is people become afraid</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="6.959">afraid to speak and that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="400.729" dur="4.53">wanted they wanted everyone scared to</text>
  <text start="403.669" dur="4.201">say anything because they wanted the</text>
  <text start="405.259" dur="5.731">population to come down on those people</text>
  <text start="407.87" dur="4.289">who were speaking freely saying that is</text>
  <text start="410.99" dur="4.349">not correct</text>
  <text start="412.159" dur="5.31">so we see right now what people are</text>
  <text start="415.339" dur="5.281">feeling right now is they really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="417.469" dur="6.211">have a discussion because of this</text>
  <text start="420.62" dur="6.78">political correctness and I agree with</text>
  <text start="423.68" dur="6.63">this free speech is free speech if you</text>
  <text start="427.4" dur="6.03">don&amp;#39;t like it well don&amp;#39;t listen that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="4.77">how it works you can&amp;#39;t tell someone what</text>
  <text start="433.43" dur="4.349">to say or what not to say because</text>
  <text start="435.08" dur="5.67">everyone has a different stance on it</text>
  <text start="437.779" dur="4.651">and who stance is right and this is the</text>
  <text start="440.75" dur="2.909">problem this is why when they said</text>
  <text start="442.43" dur="3.93">everyone has the right to free speech</text>
  <text start="443.659" dur="3.961">you can pretty much say anything doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="3.33">mean that other people have to listen</text>
  <text start="447.62" dur="3.99">doesn&amp;#39;t mean what you&amp;#39;re saying is nice</text>
  <text start="449.69" dur="3.15">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean any of that stuff it</text>
  <text start="451.61" dur="5.04">means that you have the right</text>
  <text start="452.84" dur="6.21">to speak your mind out in North Korea</text>
  <text start="456.65" dur="4.519">what are we saying well there was a</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="4.679">high-level North Korean defector and</text>
  <text start="461.169" dur="5.611">they&amp;#39;re saying that he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="463.729" dur="8.851">Americans should bring change peacefully</text>
  <text start="466.78" dur="7.27">by talking to North Korea this person</text>
  <text start="472.58" dur="3.809">said we should start from the basic</text>
  <text start="474.05" dur="5.81">concepts of human rights and freedom and</text>
  <text start="476.389" dur="7.141">he said not railing against the Kim</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="7.63">dictatorship and communism and once</text>
  <text start="483.53" dur="5.43">again yes we need to have dialogue now</text>
  <text start="487.49" dur="3.72">South Korea is doing something very</text>
  <text start="488.96" dur="4.95">interesting president moon jae-in is</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="4.29">saying listen we don&amp;#39;t want nuclear</text>
  <text start="493.91" dur="3.24">weapons we don&amp;#39;t care what the north is</text>
  <text start="495.5" dur="4.08">doing right now if they&amp;#39;re testing</text>
  <text start="497.15" dur="6.75">nuclear weapons because mu president</text>
  <text start="499.58" dur="7.53">moon jae-in he understands that kim jong</text>
  <text start="503.9" dur="6.93">hoon is protecting his country against</text>
  <text start="507.11" dur="6.049">regime change everyone is not in the</text>
  <text start="510.83" dur="5.88">dark here people know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="513.159" dur="6.971">Russia knows China knows do-dirty knows</text>
  <text start="516.71" dur="5.579">from the Philippines everyone knows what</text>
  <text start="520.13" dur="5.13">the Cabal does they go into countries</text>
  <text start="522.289" dur="5.101">and they remove those in government and</text>
  <text start="525.26" dur="5.4">replace them if you have nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="527.39" dur="6.09">guess what it&amp;#39;s very tough to do and</text>
  <text start="530.66" dur="4.02">most of the time it&amp;#39;s not done at all so</text>
  <text start="533.48" dur="3.21">we can see right now South Korea is</text>
  <text start="534.68" dur="3.99">saying listen we&amp;#39;re not buying into this</text>
  <text start="536.69" dur="4.56">we don&amp;#39;t want nuclear weapons we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="538.67" dur="3.69">want to start a nuclear race between the</text>
  <text start="541.25" dur="5.25">north and the south</text>
  <text start="542.36" dur="5.93">and we&amp;#39;re opting out which I believe is</text>
  <text start="546.5" dur="5.67">the right thing to do at this point and</text>
  <text start="548.29" dur="5.59">hopefully the peace talks can continue</text>
  <text start="552.17" dur="3.51">because that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening behind</text>
  <text start="553.88" dur="4.77">the scenes right now they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="555.68" dur="6.36">about peace they&amp;#39;re working out a way to</text>
  <text start="558.65" dur="6.39">calm the situation down Russia right now</text>
  <text start="562.04" dur="5.79">is rejecting the u.s. demands for</text>
  <text start="565.04" dur="5.76">changes in the Iran nuclear deal and we</text>
  <text start="567.83" dur="6">need to remember that the joint</text>
  <text start="570.8" dur="5.81">comprehensive plan of action is not</text>
  <text start="573.83" dur="6.21">going to be amended or we renegotiated</text>
  <text start="576.61" dur="6.729">Russia is a signatory and a co guarantor</text>
  <text start="580.04" dur="5.88">of the jcpoa alongside its ally China</text>
  <text start="583.339" dur="2.881">and is also a permanent member of the UN</text>
  <text start="585.92" dur="1.77">sir</text>
  <text start="586.22" dur="3.63">Kirti Council whose agreement would be</text>
  <text start="587.69" dur="5.01">needed for any international sanctions</text>
  <text start="589.85" dur="6.63">on Iran that means that without the</text>
  <text start="592.7" dur="6.06">Russians agreement the jcpoa cannot be</text>
  <text start="596.48" dur="3.93">changed or amended or renegotiated and</text>
  <text start="598.76" dur="4.8">the UN Security Council cannot impose</text>
  <text start="600.41" dur="6.15">further international sanctions on Iran</text>
  <text start="603.56" dur="5.85">so basically it&amp;#39;s dead in the water and</text>
  <text start="606.56" dur="4.56">I think what Trump&amp;#39;s plan was was to</text>
  <text start="609.41" dur="5.94">bring it up he really didn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="611.12" dur="8.67">with it and pass it to Congress let the</text>
  <text start="615.35" dur="7.77">people decide and again Iran is not</text>
  <text start="619.79" dur="5.97">going to start a war Iran is not trying</text>
  <text start="623.12" dur="5.52">to push terrorism across the world it is</text>
  <text start="625.76" dur="6.98">the cabal that was doing all of this in</text>
  <text start="628.64" dur="4.1">all the Middle Eastern countries</text>
  <text start="633.25" dur="5.8">striking fear here in the United States</text>
  <text start="636.02" dur="4.5">with terror with mass shootings and</text>
  <text start="639.05" dur="3.3">everything else that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="640.52" dur="5.55">and all of this is starting to fall</text>
  <text start="642.35" dur="6.66">apart we see the Iraqi Armed Forces they</text>
  <text start="646.07" dur="5.4">resume their offenses their offensive to</text>
  <text start="649.01" dur="4.44">liberate the Syrian border and they</text>
  <text start="651.47" dur="4.08">liberated new areas and the Al Anbar</text>
  <text start="653.45" dur="4.62">government and we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="658.07" dur="8.16">is no Co border type of agreement with</text>
  <text start="663.44" dur="4.92">the Kurds the Iraqi government is</text>
  <text start="666.23" dur="3.9">controlling the border and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="668.36" dur="4.92">doing it with the Kurds whatsoever</text>
  <text start="670.13" dur="4.53">Tillerson he was testifying in front of</text>
  <text start="673.28" dur="4.38">the Senate Foreign Relations Committee</text>
  <text start="674.66" dur="6.21">and he said listen even if Iraq tells us</text>
  <text start="677.66" dur="7.26">to leave the u.s. is not leaving Iraq</text>
  <text start="680.87" dur="6.21">well isn&amp;#39;t that an invasion then because</text>
  <text start="684.92" dur="5.22">if a country says listen we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="687.08" dur="6.68">your troops in our country anymore I</text>
  <text start="690.14" dur="6.75">believe that country needs to leave and</text>
  <text start="693.76" dur="6.61">we see right now they&amp;#39;re saying that no</text>
  <text start="696.89" dur="6.9">we are not leaving now of course this</text>
  <text start="700.37" dur="4.89">will be left up to Congress because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="703.79" dur="3.72">going to pass to Congress to make a</text>
  <text start="705.26" dur="3.84">decision and the people are going to</text>
  <text start="707.51" dur="2.82">look this look at this and saying okay</text>
  <text start="709.1" dur="3">this country doesn&amp;#39;t want us in there</text>
  <text start="710.33" dur="4.11">but you&amp;#39;re telling us that we have to</text>
  <text start="712.1" dur="4.83">say and I think what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="714.44" dur="5.37">now is all this stuff is being brought</text>
  <text start="716.93" dur="5.61">up to make it public</text>
  <text start="719.81" dur="5.1">so people question it people say what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="722.54" dur="6.419">going on here and it&amp;#39;s passed to</text>
  <text start="724.91" dur="5.609">Congress now it looks like a senior US</text>
  <text start="728.959" dur="3.511">military commander in the operation</text>
  <text start="730.519" dur="3.87">against the Islamic state in Syria he</text>
  <text start="732.47" dur="4.049">got slightly confused when asked about</text>
  <text start="734.389" dur="3.63">the exact number of US troops in Syria</text>
  <text start="736.519" dur="4.351">now remember they told us there&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="738.019" dur="4.29">250 troops in Syria or five hundred</text>
  <text start="740.87" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re bringing it up to five hundred</text>
  <text start="742.309" dur="6.39">well it turns out there&amp;#39;s around four</text>
  <text start="746.48" dur="4.2">thousand which I&amp;#39;m gonna say there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="748.699" dur="4.31">probably more like nine thousand or you</text>
  <text start="750.68" dur="5.61">even a little bit more in Syria</text>
  <text start="753.009" dur="6.64">controlling the Kurdish area helping the</text>
  <text start="756.29" dur="8.149">Syrian democratic forces and we see at</text>
  <text start="759.649" dur="8.071">this point that the time is coming that</text>
  <text start="764.439" dur="4.84">United States the coalition forces even</text>
  <text start="767.72" dur="3.75">the Syrian democratic forces they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="769.279" dur="4.47">going to be asked to leave or the Syrian</text>
  <text start="771.47" dur="4.38">democratic forces are going to be asked</text>
  <text start="773.749" dur="5.041">to integrate into the Syrian Armed</text>
  <text start="775.85" dur="5.159">Forces and we&amp;#39;re just weeks away from</text>
  <text start="778.79" dur="5.07">this and I think this is coming very</text>
  <text start="781.009" dur="4.68">very quickly and the Cabal doesn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="783.86" dur="5.399">what to do with this at this point now</text>
  <text start="785.689" dur="6.51">we see something happened in New York it</text>
  <text start="789.259" dur="5.07">looks like there was another type of</text>
  <text start="792.199" dur="4.021">false flag incident and remember false</text>
  <text start="794.329" dur="3.421">flag doesn&amp;#39;t mean that nobody dies it</text>
  <text start="796.22" dur="3.809">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that nobody gets hurt it</text>
  <text start="797.75" dur="3.93">means that it was planned to make it</text>
  <text start="800.029" dur="5.73">look like it was coming from someplace</text>
  <text start="801.68" dur="6.48">else and investigators from the FBI and</text>
  <text start="805.759" dur="5.791">the NYPD they&amp;#39;re probing the background</text>
  <text start="808.16" dur="7.02">of this 29 year old suspect Saifu low</text>
  <text start="811.55" dur="4.709">sigh paav and he&amp;#39;s taken into custody he</text>
  <text start="815.18" dur="5.37">is not dead</text>
  <text start="816.259" dur="6.39">looks like he rented a truck and mowed</text>
  <text start="820.55" dur="5.43">down something like eight people or so</text>
  <text start="822.649" dur="8.13">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the FBI</text>
  <text start="825.98" dur="6.329">actually interrogated this individual</text>
  <text start="830.779" dur="3.961">they knew who this individual was like</text>
  <text start="832.309" dur="4.921">they always do and we see site</text>
  <text start="834.74" dur="4.909">intelligence is involved with this this</text>
  <text start="837.23" dur="4.979">is Rita Katz and we know they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="839.649" dur="4.66">propaganda outfit from Israel and</text>
  <text start="842.209" dur="4.411">they&amp;#39;re showing this phone that look</text>
  <text start="844.309" dur="5.52">weeks ahead of time they showed the</text>
  <text start="846.62" dur="4.889">Islamic state symbol by New York showing</text>
  <text start="849.829" dur="3.151">that they were ready to do something</text>
  <text start="851.509" dur="3.901">while this could have come from anywhere</text>
  <text start="852.98" dur="4.44">this is absolutely meaningless but it</text>
  <text start="855.41" dur="4.289">looks really good and people do believe</text>
  <text start="857.42" dur="4.38">it when they see it because you know</text>
  <text start="859.699" dur="4.291">once they tell you what it is your mind</text>
  <text start="861.8" dur="4.409">automatically goes into saying oh my god</text>
  <text start="863.99" dur="5.52">they planned this weeks in advance now</text>
  <text start="866.209" dur="5.731">really you had a plan this week in event</text>
  <text start="869.51" dur="4.769">weeks in advance and renting a truck and</text>
  <text start="871.94" dur="3.93">just driving it into people I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="874.279" dur="7.591">if this really takes that much planning</text>
  <text start="875.87" dur="8.459">and again this was done to scare</text>
  <text start="881.87" dur="5.31">everyone remember out in Syria the</text>
  <text start="884.329" dur="5.07">Islamic state they are basically</text>
  <text start="887.18" dur="4.23">disappearing and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="889.399" dur="5.161">convince us that they&amp;#39;re still around</text>
  <text start="891.41" dur="6.119">that they can still push their agenda of</text>
  <text start="894.56" dur="6.3">terror now once again the FBI</text>
  <text start="897.529" dur="6">interviewed this individual this</text>
  <text start="900.86" dur="6.69">individual came into the country in 2010</text>
  <text start="903.529" dur="6.42">under Obama&amp;#39;s diversity visa program and</text>
  <text start="907.55" dur="3.839">people are questioning this Trump is out</text>
  <text start="909.949" dur="3.541">there saying we need to shut this down</text>
  <text start="911.389" dur="5.041">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="913.49" dur="5.909">during the whole Vegas shooting there</text>
  <text start="916.43" dur="4.349">were no real photographs from people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="919.399" dur="3.511">phones I mean thousands and thousands of</text>
  <text start="920.779" dur="3.721">people were there you know everyone had</text>
  <text start="922.91" dur="3.989">a phone people were always taking</text>
  <text start="924.5" dur="3.959">selfies and taking pictures but there</text>
  <text start="926.899" dur="4.711">were no photos whatsoever except the</text>
  <text start="928.459" dur="5.581">clear beautiful photos from professional</text>
  <text start="931.61" dur="5.099">photographers and it&amp;#39;s amazing how clear</text>
  <text start="934.04" dur="5.01">their photos could be while an event</text>
  <text start="936.709" dur="4.711">like this is going on but in this</text>
  <text start="939.05" dur="6.029">instance it seems like there were photos</text>
  <text start="941.42" dur="6.3">of the individual and they were captured</text>
  <text start="945.079" dur="4.921">so we see a couple things happening here</text>
  <text start="947.72" dur="5.849">right now where there&amp;#39;s different levels</text>
  <text start="950" dur="5.459">of false flags and we don&amp;#39;t know who</text>
  <text start="953.569" dur="4.26">exactly put this one together but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="955.459" dur="4.891">very also is very interesting is they</text>
  <text start="957.829" dur="5.431">were talking about gun control because</text>
  <text start="960.35" dur="4.94">guns were the problem during Vegas well</text>
  <text start="963.26" dur="5.4">this was a truck shouldn&amp;#39;t we have</text>
  <text start="965.29" dur="5.95">stricter truck rental rules or banning</text>
  <text start="968.66" dur="4.89">trucks on roads I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="971.24" dur="5.279">we have two of the same things happening</text>
  <text start="973.55" dur="6.33">right now where individuals allegedly</text>
  <text start="976.519" dur="5.581">killed people one with a gun one with a</text>
  <text start="979.88" dur="5.309">truck how come the trucks not</text>
  <text start="982.1" dur="4.77">responsible but but in the gun shooting</text>
  <text start="985.189" dur="3.721">the gun is responsible this make</text>
  <text start="986.87" dur="4.11">no sense whatsoever and this is how they</text>
  <text start="988.91" dur="4.44">have their double standards and it makes</text>
  <text start="990.98" dur="4.56">no sense whatsoever now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="993.35" dur="4.8">seeing at this point is that the Cabal</text>
  <text start="995.54" dur="4.32">is pushing their agenda very hard and I</text>
  <text start="998.15" dur="5.01">believe we&amp;#39;re gonna see many many more</text>
  <text start="999.86" dur="5.58">events here coming up we also have the</text>
  <text start="1003.16" dur="3.8">FBI drill going on in Kings Dominion in</text>
  <text start="1005.44" dur="3.75">the amusement park</text>
  <text start="1006.96" dur="4.9">another event could occur anywhere</text>
  <text start="1009.19" dur="5.21">because they need a lot of distractions</text>
  <text start="1011.86" dur="5.94">because what is happening right now as</text>
  <text start="1014.4" dur="6.79">this manna for indictment completely</text>
  <text start="1017.8" dur="5.67">goes absolutely nowhere and others start</text>
  <text start="1021.19" dur="4.8">to investigate the connections between</text>
  <text start="1023.47" dur="5.459">Ukraine the Clintons the uranium one</text>
  <text start="1025.99" dur="4.8">deal the fusion GPS Trump dossier and</text>
  <text start="1028.929" dur="6.061">all this stuff it&amp;#39;s all going to lead to</text>
  <text start="1030.79" dur="6.51">Podesta Clinton Obama and the rest they</text>
  <text start="1034.99" dur="5.04">need as many distractions as they</text>
  <text start="1037.3" dur="4.86">possibly can to distract everyone from</text>
  <text start="1040.03" dur="3.899">what is happening and these distractions</text>
  <text start="1042.16" dur="4.62">are going to get bigger and bigger as we</text>
  <text start="1043.929" dur="4.741">move along because as we can see they</text>
  <text start="1046.78" dur="5.1">need the distractions not just for one</text>
  <text start="1048.67" dur="6.03">agenda but for many first they need it</text>
  <text start="1051.88" dur="5.28">for the economy completely failing the</text>
  <text start="1054.7" dur="4.62">central banks they are stuck so they</text>
  <text start="1057.16" dur="4.29">need something to cover this up the</text>
  <text start="1059.32" dur="3.72">Cabal they needed to cover up because</text>
  <text start="1061.45" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s so much corruption there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1063.04" dur="2.25">much stolen money I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="1064.6" dur="2.13">the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="1065.29" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;ve just lost trillions and</text>
  <text start="1066.73" dur="4.29">trillions of dollars I think it&amp;#39;s up to</text>
  <text start="1068.02" dur="6.75">21 trillion dollars they need this huge</text>
  <text start="1071.02" dur="4.62">cover-up so no one even looks at what</text>
  <text start="1074.77" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="1075.64" dur="6.03">we know that Mueller most likely has</text>
  <text start="1078.85" dur="5.07">been inside cleaning up a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1081.67" dur="4.5">records and they definitely don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1083.92" dur="4.8">anyone looking into all these different</text>
  <text start="1086.17" dur="4.29">agreements and all the different plans</text>
  <text start="1088.72" dur="3.33">and all the different documents and all</text>
  <text start="1090.46" dur="3.87">the deals that have been made over the</text>
  <text start="1092.05" dur="3.72">past couple of years where they were</text>
  <text start="1094.33" dur="2.97">selling this stuff to foreign</text>
  <text start="1095.77" dur="3.36">governments because this would be a huge</text>
  <text start="1097.3" dur="4.98">problem and a lot of people would go to</text>
  <text start="1099.13" dur="8.13">jail and they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;d rather blow</text>
  <text start="1102.28" dur="9.09">things up and create distractions then</text>
  <text start="1107.26" dur="6.69">to be dragged into some type of trial</text>
  <text start="1111.37" dur="4.65">where they&amp;#39;re put in front of the</text>
  <text start="1113.95" dur="4.5">corporate media where they have no</text>
  <text start="1116.02" dur="3.93">choice but to broadcast this the people</text>
  <text start="1118.45" dur="2.37">of America are looking at these</text>
  <text start="1119.95" dur="3.45">individuals</text>
  <text start="1120.82" dur="4.2">saying what just happened here so they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1123.4" dur="4.29">rather have some type of distraction</text>
  <text start="1125.02" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;d rather push their agenda and it</text>
  <text start="1127.69" dur="3.39">looks like they&amp;#39;re not going to stop it</text>
