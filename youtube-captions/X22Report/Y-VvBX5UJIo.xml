  <text start="84.229" dur="4.351">economic plan that Trump and the</text>
  <text start="86.18" dur="3.75">Patriots are pushing forward it is</text>
  <text start="88.58" dur="3.36">starting to come together now just</text>
  <text start="89.93" dur="4.62">because everything doesn&amp;#39;t happen in a</text>
  <text start="91.94" dur="5.34">straight line it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="94.55" dur="6.209">not working or this is not part of the</text>
  <text start="97.28" dur="5.36">plan a lot of plans go off to one</text>

  <text start="102.64" dur="6.369">sometimes this is to get what you really</text>
  <text start="106.399" dur="4.801">want and I believe this is what Trump</text>
  <text start="109.009" dur="4.5">and the Patriots are doing sometimes it</text>
  <text start="111.2" dur="4.559">seems like nothing is happening and then</text>
  <text start="113.509" dur="3.661">all of a sudden it&amp;#39;s exactly what we</text>
  <text start="115.759" dur="6.72">thought was going to happen</text>

  <text start="124.88" dur="4.86">gonna continually push back they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="127.34" dur="5.1">want to give Trump is using leverage</text>
  <text start="129.74" dur="5.28">he&amp;#39;s using tariffs he uses tariffs for</text>
  <text start="132.44" dur="5.1">many different countries now because it</text>
  <text start="135.02" dur="5.34">allows him to put pressure on that</text>
  <text start="137.54" dur="5.4">country something they&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="140.36" dur="5.28">before why because they were given</text>
  <text start="142.94" dur="5.159">anything they wanted this was part of</text>
  <text start="145.64" dur="5.28">the deep State the globalist plan now</text>
  <text start="148.099" dur="5.281">there&amp;#39;s a true negotiator in the</text>
  <text start="150.92" dur="4.92">driver&amp;#39;s seat and they&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="153.38" dur="4.23">this before they&amp;#39;ve never seen someone</text>
  <text start="155.84" dur="3.599">come out and say hey we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="157.61" dur="3.959">placing tariffs on you hey we&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="170.18" dur="4.619">it and they&amp;#39;re stuck in a corner and</text>
  <text start="173.629" dur="2.75">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a way to</text>
  <text start="174.799" dur="5.58">get around all of this</text>
  <text start="176.379" dur="7.181">so Beijing right now they brought</text>
  <text start="180.379" dur="7.681">someone else in they brought someone</text>
  <text start="183.56" dur="8.209">else in to help vice premier Liu and it</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="8.22">looks like it&amp;#39;s Zhong who is going to</text>
  <text start="191.769" dur="7.211">really drive the ship for China but what</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="6.45">does this really mean it really means</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="7.56">this is exactly what Trump wanted</text>
  <text start="202.73" dur="5.94">someone there to really negotiate with</text>
  <text start="206.54" dur="5.279">him now this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="4.8">conservative tree house Beijing attempts</text>
  <text start="211.819" dur="3.991">to downplay the position of their</text>
  <text start="213.47" dur="4.079">hardline commerce edition but the</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="4.769">reality of the restarted trade</text>

  <text start="223.879" dur="4.67">presented bait and is going to engage in</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="6.449">full confrontational trade war with</text>
  <text start="228.549" dur="6.881">Trump and the US team ultimately an</text>
  <text start="232.819" dur="5.25">openly hostile and aggressive position</text>
  <text start="235.43" dur="6.089">by China is exactly what Trump would</text>
  <text start="238.069" dur="5.64">prefer pretence is a painstakingly</text>
  <text start="241.519" dur="5.34">annoying negotiation strategy and</text>
  <text start="243.709" dur="6.21">president Trump is predisposed to be a</text>

  <text start="256.82" dur="5.37">now are departing China the belt and</text>
  <text start="259.28" dur="5.639">Road initiative shrinking and Beijing is</text>
  <text start="262.19" dur="5.88">burning through cash to subsidize their</text>
  <text start="264.919" dur="5.131">current manufacturing base existing</text>
  <text start="268.07" dur="5.69">tariffs remain a financial drain on</text>
  <text start="270.05" dur="6.48">China not the u.s. not the consumers in</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="5.68">actuality US inflation continues to</text>
  <text start="276.53" dur="5.15">decline meanwhile President Trump is</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="4.979">hitting G with public questions about</text>
  <text start="281.68" dur="6.01">Beijing purchasing US agricultural</text>
  <text start="284.419" dur="5.131">products a previous promised China</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="4.469">appears to have accepted that Trump</text>
  <text start="289.55" dur="5.13">isn&amp;#39;t going to concede an inch therefore</text>
  <text start="292.159" dur="5.041">their position in the trade standoff is</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="6.03">timed to exhaust around</text>
  <text start="297.2" dur="6.81">20 presidential election which is very</text>
  <text start="300.71" dur="6.18">interesting despite what the US media</text>
  <text start="304.01" dur="5.43">are claiming Beijing is making very</text>
  <text start="306.89" dur="4.68">visible moves to withstand more than a</text>
  <text start="309.44" dur="4.68">year of status quo strain</text>
  <text start="311.57" dur="4.5">generally speaking trump has followed</text>
  <text start="314.12" dur="4.62">the 90-day process within most of the</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="6.78">trade negotiations and discussions which</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="6.24">means he weight around 90 days as the US</text>
  <text start="322.85" dur="5.04">team works to negotiate a particular</text>
  <text start="324.98" dur="5.91">point and then if nothing he makes a</text>
  <text start="327.89" dur="5.7">larger move to cut the Gordian knot if</text>
  <text start="330.89" dur="6.09">this pattern holds we will likely see</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="5.94">Trump do something significant to target</text>
  <text start="336.98" dur="6.2">the Chinese stalemate around September</text>
  <text start="339.53" dur="7.71">late September that&amp;#39;s the time frame and</text>
  <text start="343.18" dur="6.04">like we said before companies are now</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="4.23">leaving China we&amp;#39;ll be getting into that</text>
  <text start="349.22" dur="5.37">in just a minute but first Trump tweeted</text>
  <text start="351.47" dur="5.88">out the following China&amp;#39;s second quarter</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="5.1">growth is the slowest it has been in</text>
  <text start="357.35" dur="4.26">more than 27 years the United States</text>
  <text start="359.69" dur="3.9">tariffs are having a major effect on</text>
  <text start="361.61" dur="4.26">companies wanting to leave China for</text>
  <text start="363.59" dur="4.11">non-tariff countries thousands of</text>
  <text start="365.87" dur="4.14">companies are leaving this is why China</text>
  <text start="367.7" dur="4.29">wants to make a deal with the US and</text>
  <text start="370.01" dur="3.78">wishes it had not broken the original</text>
  <text start="371.99" dur="4.02">deal in the first place in the meantime</text>
  <text start="373.79" dur="4.44">we are receiving billions of dollars in</text>
  <text start="376.01" dur="4.62">terrorists from China with possibly much</text>
  <text start="378.23" dur="5.82">more to come these tariffs are paid for</text>
  <text start="380.63" dur="7.65">by China devaluing and pumping not by</text>
  <text start="384.05" dur="6.81">the US taxpayer now the economic plan</text>
  <text start="388.28" dur="4.71">which China is working because one of</text>
  <text start="390.86" dur="4.59">the outcomes that Trump actually wanted</text>
  <text start="392.99" dur="4.59">he wanted companies to leave trying to</text>
  <text start="395.45" dur="4.11">remember the deep state the globalists</text>
  <text start="397.58" dur="4.49">they were pushing all the companies out</text>
  <text start="399.56" dur="7.38">of the United States and into China</text>
  <text start="402.07" dur="7.39">Trump is reversing their plan and when</text>
  <text start="406.94" dur="5.31">we look at this we can see that there</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="5.22">are companies that are moving out of</text>
  <text start="412.25" dur="6.54">China and some are coming back to the</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="7.05">United States so yetee Holdings iRobot</text>
  <text start="418.79" dur="5.76">Corp Crocs and many many others are</text>
  <text start="421.73" dur="4.89">moving production out of China to</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="5.79">countries such as Vietnam India Taiwan</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="6.42">Malaysia and many more</text>
  <text start="430.34" dur="5.85">and this is coming from loveSac company</text>
  <text start="433.04" dur="5.25">the CEO this is a furniture maker he</text>
  <text start="436.19" dur="5.31">said we have been shifting production to</text>
  <text start="438.29" dur="7.14">Vietnam very aggressively once you move</text>
  <text start="441.5" dur="8.3">you don&amp;#39;t move back think about it why</text>
  <text start="445.43" dur="9.33">don&amp;#39;t they move back it&amp;#39;s too expensive</text>
  <text start="449.8" dur="7.45">so the cost of moving out pays off</text>
  <text start="454.76" dur="4.29">because they are moving someplace where</text>
  <text start="457.25" dur="5.91">there&amp;#39;s no tariffs but moving back</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="7.11">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense for them and some of</text>
  <text start="463.16" dur="7.58">these companies they&amp;#39;re coming back to</text>
  <text start="466.16" dur="6.96">the United States so the plan is working</text>
  <text start="470.74" dur="3.94">remember we need to bring the companies</text>
  <text start="473.12" dur="3.66">back we need to bring manufacturers back</text>
  <text start="474.68" dur="4.58">we need to bring bring all of this back</text>
  <text start="476.78" dur="6.06">to United States and out of China</text>
  <text start="479.26" dur="6.58">because the plan was to have China as</text>
  <text start="482.84" dur="4.23">the powerhouse why do you think Clinton</text>
  <text start="485.84" dur="3.389">was selling the secrets to China</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="5.67">bringing up their military up to the</text>
  <text start="489.229" dur="5.221">level of the United States because what</text>
  <text start="492.74" dur="3.84">was going to happen here we were going</text>
  <text start="494.45" dur="4.35">to have a war United States was going to</text>
  <text start="496.58" dur="3.48">lose because they weren&amp;#39;t putting any</text>
  <text start="498.8" dur="4.04">money into the military</text>
  <text start="500.06" dur="7.14">China was gonna be the dominant power</text>
  <text start="502.84" dur="8.53">that was their entire plan that entire</text>
  <text start="507.2" dur="7.05">globalist plan has been shut down now</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="4.71">the central bankers they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="514.25" dur="4.469">get ahead of the story that the Fed has</text>
  <text start="516.08" dur="4.589">no idea in what they&amp;#39;re doing now of</text>
  <text start="518.719" dur="3.81">course this is planned with Trump and</text>
  <text start="520.669" dur="3.18">the Patriots to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="522.529" dur="4.261">Fed and doesn&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="523.849" dur="4.891">and this is being pushed out there</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="3.6">because later on they&amp;#39;re gonna blame</text>
  <text start="528.74" dur="3.63">everything on the Fed but the other</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="4.77">central banks they&amp;#39;re coming to the</text>
  <text start="532.37" dur="4.65">rescue of the Fed and this is coming</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="4.35">from the International Monetary Fund&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.02" dur="4.83">deputy managing director he is out there</text>
  <text start="539.51" dur="6.24">defending the feds policy stance and</text>
  <text start="541.85" dur="5.46">this is tau Zang he said we consider</text>
  <text start="545.75" dur="4.23">what the Fed has been doing is</text>
  <text start="547.31" dur="5.04">consistent with the approach that&amp;#39;s data</text>
  <text start="549.98" dur="4.799">dependent and done too well communicated</text>
  <text start="552.35" dur="4.08">statements with the market I think</text>
  <text start="554.779" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;re doing a fine job at this moment</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="5.43">and we hope they continue to do that job</text>
  <text start="558.77" dur="4.41">down the road he said at the moment we</text>
  <text start="561.86" dur="3.72">consider there</text>
  <text start="563.18" dur="4.71">the feds approach as appropriate for the</text>
  <text start="565.58" dur="4.11">US economy and we do urge everybody in</text>
  <text start="567.89" dur="4.26">particularly those major central banks</text>
  <text start="569.69" dur="4.17">and other policymakers to follow the</text>
  <text start="572.15" dur="4.77">same approach which is well communicated</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="6.3">to the markets and dated dependent now</text>
  <text start="576.92" dur="6.48">think about this for a second the IMF is</text>
  <text start="580.16" dur="5.54">out there defending the Fed that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.4" dur="5.64">doing a great job</text>
  <text start="585.7" dur="6.58">now remember their plan was to raise</text>
  <text start="589.04" dur="4.92">rates the ECB was going to follow they</text>
  <text start="592.28" dur="4.02">were going to use this to bring down the</text>
  <text start="593.96" dur="4.41">economy that was the central bankers</text>
  <text start="596.3" dur="3.83">plan everything has been reversed</text>
  <text start="598.37" dur="4.89">because the Patriots are now in control</text>
  <text start="600.13" dur="4.63">what is the central bank own to say the</text>
  <text start="603.26" dur="2.46">Fed doesn&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing of</text>
  <text start="604.76" dur="3.66">course not</text>
  <text start="605.72" dur="6.48">but it plays right into the Patriots</text>
  <text start="608.42" dur="6.69">trap because now the other central banks</text>
  <text start="612.2" dur="6.45">the IMF they&amp;#39;re all backing the Fed</text>
  <text start="615.11" dur="7.2">think about this for a second what</text>
  <text start="618.65" dur="7.62">happens when the entire system collapses</text>
  <text start="622.31" dur="7.04">and Trump blames the Fed because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="626.27" dur="6.66">what&amp;#39;s going to happen all those</text>
  <text start="629.35" dur="6.28">individuals all those mainstream media</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="4.41">channels all the central banks who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="635.63" dur="2.91">been saying that the Fed knows what</text>
  <text start="637.34" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re doing a great job</text>
  <text start="638.54" dur="7.59">they&amp;#39;re all going to take the fall Trump</text>
  <text start="643.49" dur="5.4">tweeted out the following we are doing</text>
  <text start="646.13" dur="3.12">great economically as a country number</text>
  <text start="648.89" dur="2.37">one</text>
  <text start="649.25" dur="4.71">despite the feds antiquated policy on</text>
  <text start="651.26" dur="3.33">rates and tighten think about what he</text>
  <text start="653.96" dur="4.29">just said here</text>
  <text start="654.59" dur="7.91">feds antiquated policy on rates and</text>
  <text start="658.25" dur="7.65">tightening he said much room to grow</text>
  <text start="662.5" dur="6.58">he&amp;#39;s calling out the Fed again saying</text>
  <text start="665.9" dur="7.08">that their policies are antiquated</text>
  <text start="669.08" dur="6.54">actually their policies are not in place</text>
  <text start="672.98" dur="5.01">to benefit the American people their</text>
  <text start="675.62" dur="6.75">policies are in place to benefit</text>
  <text start="677.99" dur="8.37">themselves and this will be led out to</text>
  <text start="682.37" dur="7.05">the public later on how they were doing</text>
  <text start="686.36" dur="5.07">things behind the scenes that were not a</text>
  <text start="689.42" dur="5.07">benefit to the people this is gonna be</text>
