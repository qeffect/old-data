  <text start="130.299" dur="8.341">will increase in value as the economy</text>
  <text start="133.69" dur="9.12">collapses and that is precious metals so</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="6.81">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="142.81" dur="6.019">economy deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="6.3">gold is surging and all of this is</text>
  <text start="148.829" dur="6.101">happening at the same time now of course</text>
  <text start="151.75" dur="5.13">the corporate media the US government</text>
  <text start="154.93" dur="5.279">they need to continually convince us</text>
  <text start="156.88" dur="4.59">that everything is okay ADP came out</text>
  <text start="160.209" dur="2.961">with their job numbers and you have to</text>
  <text start="161.47" dur="6.379">remember back in May they</text>
  <text start="163.17" dur="7.319">had a disastrous payroll print but guess</text>
  <text start="167.849" dur="5.821">what happened in june all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="170.489" dur="6.451">they revised maze numbers down a little</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="5.75">bit further June came in at a hundred</text>
  <text start="176.94" dur="4.89">and seventy two thousand jobs and</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="4.36">they&amp;#39;re saying many muster just have</text>
  <text start="181.83" dur="4.53">been an anomaly it&amp;#39;s not really a big</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="5.61">deal don&amp;#39;t even look at it we&amp;#39;re back on</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="5.64">track we messed up on our manipulation</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="6.71">in May we manipulated here in June where</text>
  <text start="192" dur="6.69">were they okay but very interestingly</text>
  <text start="196.1" dur="5.919">manufacturing lost about five thousand</text>
  <text start="198.69" dur="8.1">jobs construction lost about 12,000 jobs</text>
  <text start="202.019" dur="10.351">and where do we see the gain in service</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="8.4">related jobs they soared now of course</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="8.58">as we know they are convincing us that</text>
  <text start="215.19" dur="9.24">were a service country and we realize at</text>
  <text start="220.95" dur="8.64">the same time that this cannot sustain</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="8.16">the country we need manufacturing and of</text>
  <text start="229.59" dur="4.739">course we can see these numbers make no</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="6.69">sense where did these people get the</text>
  <text start="234.329" dur="8.581">jobs once again we see restaurants we</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="6.239">see retail stores traffic is slowing up</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="5.04">business is not as good we see many</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="5.641">stores contracting and closing and</text>
  <text start="247.95" dur="5.069">laying off people and the only place</text>
  <text start="251.16" dur="4.02">that they&amp;#39;re really going is into health</text>
  <text start="253.019" dur="4.861">care because what can the government</text>
  <text start="255.18" dur="5.13">control at this point well they use the</text>
  <text start="257.88" dur="4.98">health care Obamacare to control the</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="4.74">spending they show up people are out</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="4.34">there spending like crazy and they show</text>
  <text start="265.05" dur="4.29">a number and of course it&amp;#39;s linked to</text>
  <text start="267.2" dur="4.39">Obamacare of course premiums are</text>
  <text start="269.34" dur="3.78">continually rising so it shows that</text>
  <text start="271.59" dur="4.65">people are spending more and more and</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="6.18">then they add that into GDP to show that</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="5.7">yes look the service industry is doing</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="5.82">well but all of this is an illusion</text>
  <text start="281.94" dur="4.949">people are not spending people are</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="3.96">barely getting by and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="286.889" dur="5.311">well i have to pay this enormous amount</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="4.98">or i don&amp;#39;t have health insurance so they</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="4.16">have no choice but it doesn&amp;#39;t go for</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="2.3">anything</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="6.24">now we&amp;#39;re getting an indicator in retail</text>
  <text start="299.71" dur="5.459">malls that vacancies they are on the</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="5.279">rise and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="6.451">that in the second quarter vacancies</text>
  <text start="308.139" dur="4.891">have increased they&amp;#39;ve gone from seven</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="3.78">point eight percent to seven point nine</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="4.199">percent and they&amp;#39;re noticing that</text>
  <text start="315.4" dur="5.13">throughout this year they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="317.229" dur="7.861">jump even further malls are having a</text>
  <text start="320.53" dur="6.66">huge problem stores are leaving the</text>
  <text start="325.09" dur="4.829">malls and of course everyone saying well</text>
  <text start="327.19" dur="4.94">everyone shops online well if that was</text>
  <text start="329.919" dur="7.171">true once again we would see an</text>
  <text start="332.13" dur="6.849">incredible surge in online sales it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="5.82">very funny cuz amazon is looking to set</text>
  <text start="338.979" dur="6.021">up a brick-and-mortar type of store so</text>
  <text start="342.91" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re going in the opposite direction</text>
  <text start="345" dur="4.12">but of course everyone wants to convince</text>
  <text start="347.41" dur="4.68">themselves that it&amp;#39;s because of the</text>
  <text start="349.12" dur="4.829">internet it&amp;#39;s because of online sales</text>
  <text start="352.09" dur="4.26">this is why the brick-and-mortar stores</text>
  <text start="353.949" dur="4.381">are doing poorly actually the reason why</text>
  <text start="356.35" dur="4.65">retail is not doing well it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="358.33" dur="4.53">people don&amp;#39;t have jobs they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="361" dur="3.599">discretionary funds to go out and say</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="5.01">you know something let&amp;#39;s go by this new</text>
  <text start="364.599" dur="5.401">TV let&amp;#39;s go by this new product instead</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="5.07">people are saying we can do with what we</text>
  <text start="370" dur="4.62">have right now we don&amp;#39;t need anymore and</text>
  <text start="372.94" dur="4.62">this is exactly what people are doing</text>
  <text start="374.62" dur="5.91">today now remember in retail sales yes</text>
  <text start="377.56" dur="5.07">they have credit card offers they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="4.77">give you a credit card they&amp;#39;ll say no</text>
  <text start="382.63" dur="4.2">interest for the first 30 days but when</text>
  <text start="385.3" dur="3.03">you look at the auto industry you look</text>
  <text start="386.83" dur="3.809">at the student loan you look at the</text>
  <text start="388.33" dur="4.17">housing market the central bankers did</text>
  <text start="390.639" dur="3.84">have the ability to control the</text>
  <text start="392.5" dur="4.11">purchases there because they were able</text>
  <text start="394.479" dur="5.431">to say listen you come in you want this</text>
  <text start="396.61" dur="4.5">brand new shiny car well you have no</text>
  <text start="399.91" dur="3.45">credit no problem you have no</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="4.05">downpayment no problem we&amp;#39;ll just let</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="5.119">you have the car go ahead drive it off a</text>
  <text start="405.16" dur="6.66">lot and this is how they&amp;#39;re able to use</text>
  <text start="408.479" dur="5.351">debt to get people to make these big</text>
  <text start="411.82" dur="4.5">purchases even though people have</text>
  <text start="413.83" dur="4.26">nothing in the bank we see the same</text>
  <text start="416.32" dur="4.159">thing with housing this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="5.4">continually lowering the standards is</text>
  <text start="420.479" dur="4.87">they need more and more people to</text>
  <text start="423.49" dur="4.169">purchase so they&amp;#39;re telling people</text>
  <text start="425.349" dur="5.161">listen subprime no problem no down</text>
  <text start="427.659" dur="5.221">payment no problem no money in the bank</text>
  <text start="430.51" dur="4.11">no problem and they&amp;#39;re allowing people</text>
  <text start="432.88" dur="3.57">to go out and purchase these type of</text>
  <text start="434.62" dur="4.5">houses it&amp;#39;s a little bit harder in the</text>
  <text start="436.45" dur="4.98">retail sector especially with items that</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="4.35">are twenty dollars fifty dollars ninety</text>
  <text start="441.43" dur="4.32">dollars yes they might be using credit</text>
  <text start="443.47" dur="5.58">cards but when their credit cards max</text>
  <text start="445.75" dur="6.77">guess what no more purchases are</text>
  <text start="449.05" dur="7.47">happening when people can&amp;#39;t get credit</text>
  <text start="452.52" dur="5.53">no more purchases are happening and many</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="4.86">people are saying listen I just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="5.91">have the funds coming in right now to</text>
  <text start="461.38" dur="4.56">pay for all of this and as we go</text>
  <text start="463.96" dur="3.75">throughout this year this situation is</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="6.12">just going to get worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="467.71" dur="7.83">time goes on now we see out in the UK</text>
  <text start="472.06" dur="6.03">the Domino&amp;#39;s keep falling Aberdeen</text>
  <text start="475.54" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;ve halted redemption requests</text>
  <text start="478.09" dur="4.92">triggered a 17-percent to cut its asset</text>
  <text start="480.64" dur="7.47">values for anyone who wants withdraw</text>
  <text start="483.01" dur="7.89">their money legal and Generals fun they</text>
  <text start="488.11" dur="5.28">also cut their value of the UK property</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="4.71">funds so we&amp;#39;re seeing this happening and</text>
  <text start="493.39" dur="5.07">a lot of these funds are saying</text>
  <text start="495.61" dur="5.67">everything is suspended right now we see</text>
  <text start="498.46" dur="5.88">the banking system in Italy it is a</text>
  <text start="501.28" dur="5.58">complete disaster and we might even see</text>
  <text start="504.34" dur="5.52">the Italian government collapse and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.86" dur="5.52">more than just a possibility they have a</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="5.01">referendum that is set for October and</text>
  <text start="512.38" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see how that</text>
  <text start="514.87" dur="6.359">turns out but when we look at the EU and</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="7.8">we look at how countries are doing under</text>
  <text start="521.229" dur="8.031">the EU we see Germany UK France they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="7.68">doing pretty well spain italy greece</text>
  <text start="529.26" dur="5.98">they&amp;#39;re not doing so well so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.42" dur="6.98">seeing right now is certain countries</text>
  <text start="535.24" dur="7.95">are doing well and other countries</text>
  <text start="539.4" dur="6.31">they&amp;#39;re suffering and this is under the</text>
  <text start="543.19" dur="4.65">same exact system so they&amp;#39;re favouring</text>
  <text start="545.71" dur="5.88">certain countries and other countries</text>
  <text start="547.84" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;re just being brought into more and</text>
  <text start="551.59" dur="6.57">more debt as time goes on now Russia</text>
  <text start="555.04" dur="8.41">their central bank they have announced</text>
  <text start="558.16" dur="9.69">preparedness to have ties with</text>
  <text start="563.45" dur="8.93">the Iranian central bank the two</text>
  <text start="567.85" dur="7.42">countries believe it&amp;#39;s necessary in</text>
  <text start="572.38" dur="4.36">deepening the banking ties to further</text>
  <text start="575.27" dur="4.59">develop the volume of the two countries</text>
  <text start="576.74" dur="6.81">trade exchanges leaving the United</text>
  <text start="579.86" dur="6.12">States on the outside now remember the</text>
  <text start="583.55" dur="5.04">nuclear deal wasn&amp;#39;t really about nuclear</text>
  <text start="585.98" dur="4.49">weapons it was more about the banking</text>
  <text start="588.59" dur="5.07">system selling their natural resources</text>
  <text start="590.47" dur="6.04">using the dollar and guess what Iran is</text>
  <text start="593.66" dur="5.28">not doing any of it they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="596.51" dur="5.67">euro most likely they&amp;#39;ll go into the one</text>
  <text start="598.94" dur="6.6">or the ruble bypassing the dollar</text>
  <text start="602.18" dur="6.69">completely we see the central banks</text>
  <text start="605.54" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re making deals with Russia forming</text>
  <text start="608.87" dur="4.88">a relationship outside of the private</text>
  <text start="611.27" dur="5.7">western central bank banking system and</text>
  <text start="613.75" dur="6.76">this is something that the u.s. was</text>
  <text start="616.97" dur="4.86">trying to push I ran into where they</text>
  <text start="620.51" dur="3.21">would go with the private western</text>
  <text start="621.83" dur="5.7">central bank system and we see this is</text>
  <text start="623.72" dur="5.73">not happening right now now something</text>
  <text start="627.53" dur="4.17">that christine lagarde said that we</text>
  <text start="629.45" dur="5.91">should all be concerned about she said</text>
  <text start="631.7" dur="7.32">that because of what happened in the UK</text>
  <text start="635.36" dur="9.05">where the people voted for a brexit she</text>
  <text start="639.02" dur="12.51">doesn&amp;#39;t see any type of global recession</text>
  <text start="644.41" dur="8.26">happening at all well we know what</text>
  <text start="651.53" dur="4.23">happens when they make these type of</text>
  <text start="652.67" dur="4.47">predictions it&amp;#39;s the opposite Bernanke</text>
  <text start="655.76" dur="3.33">said this back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="657.14" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re not forecasting recession</text>
  <text start="659.09" dur="4.14">Lagarde is out there saying they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="661.13" dur="4.95">forecasting any type of global recession</text>
  <text start="663.23" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s unlikely to happen despite the prek</text>
  <text start="666.08" dur="5.82">capote we should be concerned at this</text>
  <text start="668.69" dur="6">point Bernanke actually is out in Japan</text>
  <text start="671.9" dur="4.26">and he&amp;#39;s in this secret meeting we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="674.69" dur="5.49">know it&amp;#39;s going to be said in this</text>
  <text start="676.16" dur="6.15">meeting he&amp;#39;s with Kuroda and obey but</text>
  <text start="680.18" dur="4.22">people are looking at this meeting and</text>
  <text start="682.31" dur="6.3">saying well maybe it&amp;#39;s time for</text>
  <text start="684.4" dur="8.23">helicopter money and we can see right</text>
  <text start="688.61" dur="8.7">now Kuroda says absolutely not we will</text>
  <text start="692.63" dur="7.44">not provide helicopter money well if we</text>
  <text start="697.31" dur="5.64">look back in time he also said the</text>
  <text start="700.07" dur="6.24">following there&amp;#39;s no plan to adopt</text>
