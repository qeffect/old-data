  <text start="86.29" dur="5.219">the US government came out and said we</text>
  <text start="88.99" dur="5.85">added a hundred and forty-two thousand</text>
  <text start="91.509" dur="6.661">jobs and everything is fine the economy</text>
  <text start="94.84" dur="6.3">is doing well and these were terrible</text>
  <text start="98.17" dur="5.989">job numbers but of course it sent the</text>
  <text start="101.14" dur="6.99">stock market to all-time new highs as</text>
  <text start="104.159" dur="8.111">bad news usually does and then we find</text>

  <text start="112.27" dur="8.459">numbers they&amp;#39;re a lot worse than they</text>
  <text start="116.74" dur="7.8">were letting everyone know and if you</text>
  <text start="120.729" dur="6.631">break them down by state not only did</text>
  <text start="124.54" dur="6.029">more than half or 28 states lose jobs in</text>
  <text start="127.36" dur="6.239">September but the total number of job</text>
  <text start="130.569" dur="6.151">losses at 120,000 was about twenty</text>
  <text start="133.599" dur="6.72">percent more than the cumulative job</text>
  <text start="136.72" dur="5.79">gains of ninety-nine thousand also not</text>
  <text start="140.319" dur="5.64">making any sense is the state with the</text>
  <text start="142.51" dur="5.729">most purported job games this is Texas</text>
  <text start="145.959" dur="4.59">because we know tens of thousands of</text>
  <text start="148.239" dur="5.851">people are being laid off from the oil</text>
  <text start="150.549" dur="6.091">industry and according to the BLS they</text>
  <text start="154.09" dur="5.43">added twenty six thousand jobs the gain</text>

  <text start="169.97" dur="7.62">uses to plug the and plug the holes and</text>
  <text start="174.739" dur="7.411">use that as filler to create their</text>
  <text start="177.59" dur="9.54">manipulated numbers and we see right now</text>
  <text start="182.15" dur="10.41">that the job numbers are getting harder</text>
  <text start="187.13" dur="14.15">and harder to manipulate I mean 28</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="14.1">states lost 120,000 jobs 22 states added</text>
  <text start="201.28" dur="8.2">ninety-nine thousand jobs I mean what is</text>
  <text start="206.66" dur="5.939">the problem here the problem is that</text>
  <text start="209.48" dur="8.21">these numbers that they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="212.599" dur="8.67">throwing at us do not match the recovery</text>
  <text start="217.69" dur="6.129">meme that the government is spewing out</text>
  <text start="221.269" dur="5.55">of the corporate media so what they do</text>
  <text start="223.819" dur="6.271">is they continually manipulate</text>
  <text start="226.819" dur="9.42">everything to fit what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="230.09" dur="8.85">and we can see that it is not looking</text>

  <text start="990.2" dur="8.46">essentially is that Moscow must gain</text>
  <text start="992.63" dur="7.62">total control of its central bank well</text>
  <text start="998.66" dur="4.05">we know the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="1000.25" dur="7.32">countries are not going to like this</text>
  <text start="1002.71" dur="7.14">whatsoever now the fact is Russia has</text>
  <text start="1007.57" dur="4.77">lost access to the Western credit and</text>
  <text start="1009.85" dur="4.14">cannot roll over its debt with the</text>
  <text start="1012.34" dur="3.81">creditors so Russia will have to pay the</text>
  <text start="1013.99" dur="5.25">principal and the interest as it comes</text>
  <text start="1016.15" dur="6.15">to that is a trillion dollars plus</text>
  <text start="1019.24" dur="4.47">interest Russia also cannot import</text>
  <text start="1022.3" dur="3.69">anything from the West without paying</text>
  <text start="1023.71" dur="5.22">double for it so arguably the country</text>
  <text start="1025.99" dur="5.579">may be now in a vet in the very position</text>
  <text start="1028.93" dur="6.84">it will be if Moscow ops for a default</text>
  <text start="1031.569" dur="7.5">and Russia kind of would have nothing to</text>
  <text start="1035.77" dur="6.929">lose by a default because the damage is</text>
  <text start="1039.069" dur="7.5">already done at this time a Russian</text>
  <text start="1042.699" dur="5.671">default right now on a 1 trillion plus</text>

  <text start="1055.54" dur="6.12">persist in its anti Russia demonization</text>
  <text start="1058.12" dur="8.13">campaign needless to add such a default</text>
  <text start="1061.66" dur="9.6">if it does occur would collapse the</text>
  <text start="1066.25" dur="12.18">entire Western financial system it would</text>
  <text start="1071.26" dur="10.7">completely crumble apart now Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1078.43" dur="7.35">as we know was developed and created</text>
  <text start="1081.96" dur="6.01">kept a secret to bring in revenue to the</text>
  <text start="1085.78" dur="4.32">government we already here Obama out</text>
  <text start="1087.97" dur="3.63">there saying the penalties are for those</text>
  <text start="1090.1" dur="3.51">people who are not taking insurance is</text>
  <text start="1091.6" dur="4.2">going to be much much higher and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1093.61" dur="6.56">hoping with these penalties it drives</text>
  <text start="1095.8" dur="4.37">more and more people into Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1100.26" dur="7.98">the Republicans are suing the Obama</text>
  <text start="1104.73" dur="8.55">administration because they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1108.24" dur="7.23">that the funding did not originate with</text>
  <text start="1113.28" dur="3.69">the Congress and that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="1115.47" dur="4.83">funding is supposed to originate from</text>
  <text start="1116.97" dur="5.82">and federal judge rosemary Collyer</text>
  <text start="1120.3" dur="5.39">rejected Obama administration request</text>
  <text start="1122.79" dur="5.07">for a quick appeal of her ruling</text>
  <text start="1125.69" dur="3.64">reinforcing for early decision and</text>
  <text start="1127.86" dur="5.42">clearing the path for the suit to move</text>
  <text start="1129.33" dur="6.24">forward this is another important step</text>
  <text start="1133.28" dur="5.35">basically in getting rid of Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1135.57" dur="5.34">the suit centers on more than a hundred</text>
  <text start="1138.63" dur="4.68">and fifty billion in federal health</text>
  <text start="1140.91" dur="4.86">insurance subsidies provided by Obama</text>
  <text start="1143.31" dur="4.11">care to low-income parolees to reduce</text>
  <text start="1145.77" dur="4.29">their payments the house argues the</text>
  <text start="1147.42" dur="5.01">subsidies are illegal because Congress</text>
  <text start="1150.06" dur="3.72">never appropriated the funds now of</text>
  <text start="1152.43" dur="2.76">course the Obama administration is out</text>
  <text start="1153.78" dur="4.95">there saying oh no we&amp;#39;re taking funds</text>
  <text start="1155.19" dur="5.25">from here from over there and we can see</text>
  <text start="1158.73" dur="3.93">that Obamacare was completely</text>
  <text start="1160.44" dur="5.46">unconstitutional it never should have</text>
  <text start="1162.66" dur="6.78">passed but we know the NSA the Obama</text>
  <text start="1165.9" dur="6.2">administration used blackmail on certain</text>
  <text start="1169.44" dur="4.08">judges to say yes this is completely</text>
  <text start="1172.1" dur="3.4">constitutional and of course that</text>
  <text start="1173.52" dur="3.93">judgment took off for two weeks and went</text>
  <text start="1175.5" dur="6.39">on vacation so reporters couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1177.45" dur="6.18">question him whatsoever now Obama knows</text>
  <text start="1181.89" dur="3.15">because he&amp;#39;s taking his order from the</text>
  <text start="1183.63" dur="2.97">central banking corporations and they</text>
  <text start="1185.04" dur="5.01">realized that this economy is falling</text>
  <text start="1186.6" dur="6.33">apart they need to continually increase</text>
  <text start="1190.05" dur="4.02">and blow up these bubbles and we know</text>
  <text start="1192.93" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re bringing in the illegal</text>
  <text start="1194.07" dur="3.96">immigrants into this country to give</text>
  <text start="1196.44" dur="3.45">them working paper so they can work for</text>
  <text start="1198.03" dur="5.25">the corporations of course the</text>
  <text start="1199.89" dur="6">corporation&amp;#39;s then are not subject to</text>
  <text start="1203.28" dur="5.49">the penalties of Obamacare plus then all</text>
  <text start="1205.89" dur="6.6">of these people can then buy cars go</text>
  <text start="1208.77" dur="5.88">back to school go into the military and</text>
  <text start="1212.49" dur="3.69">they can continually blow up more and</text>
  <text start="1214.65" dur="3.03">more bubbles because what they need is</text>
  <text start="1216.18" dur="3.42">more and more debt this is how the</text>
  <text start="1217.68" dur="3.51">system works and the Obama</text>
  <text start="1219.6" dur="3.39">administration right now is moving to</text>
  <text start="1221.19" dur="3.56">push illegal immigrant students to</text>
  <text start="1222.99" dur="5.1">enroll in high school and college</text>
  <text start="1224.75" dur="5.68">announcing a list of rights they said</text>
  <text start="1228.09" dur="4.56">illegal immigrants are entitled to well</text>
  <text start="1230.43" dur="3.33">if you&amp;#39;re illegal and you really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1232.65" dur="3.21">belong to the in</text>
  <text start="1233.76" dur="7.74">this country you really don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1235.86" dur="6.66">rights because you&amp;#39;re here illegally so</text>
  <text start="1241.5" dur="5.07">we might as well just get rid of the</text>
  <text start="1242.52" dur="6.09">borders then so right now they are</text>
  <text start="1246.57" dur="4.23">offering tips on how the students can</text>
  <text start="1248.61" dur="5.24">apply and if you notice how they can</text>
  <text start="1250.8" dur="6.18">apply for scholarships and financial aid</text>
  <text start="1253.85" dur="5.98">financial aid in particular why because</text>
  <text start="1256.98" dur="4.59">they want more student loans out there</text>
  <text start="1259.83" dur="4.59">to blow up the bubble they&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="1261.57" dur="6.12">out of Americans in this country to do</text>
  <text start="1264.42" dur="5.37">so we are tapped out and think about</text>
  <text start="1267.69" dur="4.05">this for a second all those people that</text>
  <text start="1269.79" dur="4.02">are going back to school and all those</text>
  <text start="1271.74" dur="5.04">people that are graduating they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1273.81" dur="6.08">find jobs they can&amp;#39;t pay back the</text>
  <text start="1276.78" dur="7.59">student loans and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1279.89" dur="7.36">the Department of Education created a 63</text>
  <text start="1284.37" dur="4.89">page handbook urging schools to create a</text>
  <text start="1287.25" dur="4.68">support group for illegal immigrant</text>
  <text start="1289.26" dur="5.16">students and their families and warned</text>
  <text start="1291.93" dur="6.03">against asking students their legal</text>
  <text start="1294.42" dur="5.37">status now I have no problem having</text>
  <text start="1297.96" dur="3.71">people come into this country I mean</text>
  <text start="1299.79" dur="4.41">this is how this country was built on</text>
  <text start="1301.67" dur="6.22">others coming into this country and</text>
  <text start="1304.2" dur="6.06">building it up now if these people want</text>
  <text start="1307.89" dur="3.78">to come into this country they should go</text>
  <text start="1310.26" dur="5.04">through the proper channels just like</text>
  <text start="1311.67" dur="5.19">everyone else and I have no problem with</text>
  <text start="1315.3" dur="4.65">this and I&amp;#39;m sure nobody else has any</text>
  <text start="1316.86" dur="5.55">problem with this but as we can see this</text>
  <text start="1319.95" dur="4.41">is time consuming this would take a long</text>
  <text start="1322.41" dur="5.76">time and a lot of these people might be</text>
  <text start="1324.36" dur="6.27">rejected so Obama central bankers the</text>
  <text start="1328.17" dur="4.92">corporation&amp;#39;s they need to bypass this</text>
  <text start="1330.63" dur="4.67">because remember Obama care needs about</text>
  <text start="1333.09" dur="5.28">22 million people he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="1335.3" dur="5.8">legalize about 8 million of the illegal</text>
  <text start="1338.37" dur="6.9">immigrants he wants more and more coming</text>
  <text start="1341.1" dur="7.35">in to support everything in this country</text>
  <text start="1345.27" dur="5.93">and this is what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="1348.45" dur="5.01">because this entire system is collapsing</text>
