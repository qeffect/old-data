  <text start="42.52" dur="3.81">government central bankers economic</text>
  <text start="44.14" dur="4.83">recovery illusion has completely</text>
  <text start="46.33" dur="6.12">disintegrated let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="48.97" dur="8.07">economic collapse financial news now ADP</text>
  <text start="52.45" dur="7.98">came out with their adp payroll and it</text>
  <text start="57.04" dur="7.56">is sorts of the highest since 2014 so it</text>
  <text start="60.43" dur="8.61">looks like according to Zandi from ADP</text>
  <text start="64.6" dur="8.51">that we are going to hit full employment</text>
  <text start="69.04" dur="7.98">by mid-year everything&amp;#39;s fine people</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="6.52">we&amp;#39;re in a complete recovery of the</text>
  <text start="77.02" dur="6.36">economy there is absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="79.63" dur="7.47">wrong well unless we look closer at the</text>
  <text start="83.38" dur="7.32">data and we look through all of the</text>
  <text start="87.1" dur="5.73">propaganda we see there are problems we</text>
  <text start="90.7" dur="3.93">see the data isn&amp;#39;t as good as everyone</text>
  <text start="92.83" dur="5.099">wants to believe and we see that this</text>
  <text start="94.63" dur="5.849">data might be manipulated like all the</text>
  <text start="97.929" dur="5.521">others and we&amp;#39;re starting to head down</text>
  <text start="100.479" dur="7.89">that path well in any case the December</text>
  <text start="103.45" dur="7.229">monthly change was up by 257,000 which</text>
  <text start="108.369" dur="3.901">is a lot better than expected they</text>
  <text start="110.679" dur="5.101">expected only a hundred ninety eight</text>
  <text start="112.27" dur="7.739">thousand and this was a huge rise was</text>
  <text start="115.78" dur="6.63">the best job gains in a year does does</text>
  <text start="120.009" dur="4.89">that sound right to everyone I mean we</text>
  <text start="122.41" dur="3.959">know that the BLS has been manipulating</text>
  <text start="124.899" dur="3.411">numbers we know the housing numbers have</text>
  <text start="126.369" dur="3.921">been manipulated for the last ten years</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="4.289">but they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us that</text>
  <text start="130.29" dur="8.05">goods-producing employment rose by</text>
  <text start="132.599" dur="8.141">23,000 in December and well up from a</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="3.66">downwardly revised two thousand the</text>
  <text start="140.74" dur="3.57">previous the negative two thousand the</text>
  <text start="142" dur="3.51">previous month the service providing</text>
  <text start="144.31" dur="3.03">employment rose by two hundred</text>
  <text start="145.51" dur="4.98">thirty-four thousand jobs in December up</text>
  <text start="147.34" dur="7.47">from an upwardly revised 213,000 in</text>
  <text start="150.49" dur="11.639">November and the question is how can</text>
  <text start="154.81" dur="8.399">this be well if you look closely at the</text>
  <text start="162.129" dur="1.861">data now we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="163.209" dur="2.161">manufacturing</text>
  <text start="163.99" dur="4.44">quite a bit we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="6.87">service sector and the US manufacturing</text>
  <text start="168.43" dur="8.33">sector added the most jobs in 11 months</text>
  <text start="172.24" dur="7.68">in December now keep that in mind the US</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="6.7">manufacturing sector added the most jobs</text>
  <text start="179.92" dur="7.56">in 11 months in December the question is</text>
  <text start="183.46" dur="7.62">quite simple with is M manufacturing</text>
  <text start="187.48" dur="6.9">employment at post-recession lows and US</text>
  <text start="191.08" dur="6.45">manufacturing PMI at post-recession lows</text>
  <text start="194.38" dur="6.62">and inventories to sales ratio at</text>
  <text start="197.53" dur="8.99">post-recession highs why are good</text>
  <text start="201" dur="10.9">producers hiring at such a frantic pace</text>
  <text start="206.52" dur="8.74">does that make sense to anyone no it</text>
  <text start="211.9" dur="7.92">doesn&amp;#39;t if manufacturing is declining</text>
  <text start="215.26" dur="8.09">the Baltic Dry Index is declining the</text>
  <text start="219.82" dur="8.43">deliveries on trucks is declining rail</text>
  <text start="223.35" dur="8.8">deliveries is declining why is there</text>
  <text start="228.25" dur="8.82">hiring in manufacturing we just got out</text>
  <text start="232.15" dur="9.12">of the holiday season something has to</text>
  <text start="237.07" dur="6.87">be manipulated here because it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="241.27" dur="4.89">match up it&amp;#39;s almost like the housing</text>
  <text start="243.94" dur="3.96">data when we talked about the housing</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="5.82">data how everything didn&amp;#39;t match up</text>
  <text start="247.9" dur="6.87">lumber demand construction spending rail</text>
  <text start="251.98" dur="4.68">traffic and then we find out that yes it</text>
  <text start="254.77" dur="3.18">was completely manipulated well I think</text>
  <text start="256.66" dur="5.46">the same thing is happening right now</text>
  <text start="257.95" dur="7.05">this is all manipulated now in the</text>
  <text start="262.12" dur="5.31">housing industry we are starting to see</text>
  <text start="265" dur="5.46">that housing is starting to really slide</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="4.95">and slide hard and when we look at</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="4.53">mortgage applications they&amp;#39;ve been going</text>
  <text start="272.38" dur="6">up and down mostly down that&amp;#39;s the trend</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="6.18">and we see that mortgage application</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="5.7">volume fell dramatically over the past</text>
  <text start="281.17" dur="7.23">two weeks even when they adjusted for</text>
  <text start="284.08" dur="7.62">holiday over the holiday season total</text>
  <text start="288.4" dur="7.37">mortgage application slid twenty-seven</text>
  <text start="291.7" dur="6.07">percent on a seasonally adjusted basis</text>
  <text start="295.77" dur="5.899">for the week ending</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="9.63">ride a 27-percent and that</text>
  <text start="301.669" dur="12.631">seasonally-adjusted refinancing fell by</text>
  <text start="307.4" dur="11.43">thirty percent the housing industry has</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="7.619">never recovered the housing industry is</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="4.769">a complete and utter bubble controlled</text>
  <text start="321.919" dur="4.111">by the central bank hedge funds</text>
  <text start="323.599" dur="6.41">investment companies foreign investors</text>
  <text start="326.03" dur="6.27">who pay in cash the American people</text>
  <text start="330.009" dur="5.141">while they&amp;#39;re still buying a couple</text>
  <text start="332.3" dur="5.58">houses here and there are completely out</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="6.21">of the market and this shows us once</text>
  <text start="337.88" dur="6.569">again that they are out of the market</text>
  <text start="341.36" dur="8.51">and the real estate market is crumbling</text>
  <text start="344.449" dur="7.681">and falling apart it will not improve</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="5.56">the only way they can get it to improve</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="4.589">is to pump in more free money to bring</text>
  <text start="355.43" dur="4.26">the interest rates back down to zero</text>
  <text start="356.719" dur="7.771">negative rates to get more people into</text>
  <text start="359.69" dur="7.71">it because at this point with the prices</text>
  <text start="364.49" dur="6.209">so high a lot of people are completely</text>
  <text start="367.4" dur="7.639">kicked out of the market and when we</text>
  <text start="370.699" dur="8.101">look at us factory orders we see well</text>
  <text start="375.039" dur="7.5">it&amp;#39;s not any better they have tumbled</text>
  <text start="378.8" dur="7.709">year-on-year for the 13th month in a row</text>
  <text start="382.539" dur="7.18">they&amp;#39;ve never dropped this far for so</text>
  <text start="386.509" dur="6.831">long without the US economy in a deep</text>
  <text start="389.719" dur="6.48">recession i&amp;#39;m going to say / depression</text>
  <text start="393.34" dur="6.689">November&amp;#39;s 4.2 percent year-on-year drop</text>
  <text start="396.199" dur="6.241">is the 13th consecutive monthly drop</text>
  <text start="400.029" dur="5.021">revisions to durable goods data shows a</text>
  <text start="402.44" dur="5.12">1 percent drop in new orders if you</text>
  <text start="405.05" dur="5.54">remove defense in November after rising</text>
  <text start="407.56" dur="6.52">one-point-four percent in October and</text>
  <text start="410.59" dur="7.5">you have to remember a lot of this data</text>
  <text start="414.08" dur="6.899">has been kind of manipulated with</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="5.169">defense orders defense aircraft and</text>
  <text start="420.979" dur="5.131">parts orders and this is at an all-time</text>
  <text start="423.259" dur="4.5">high at this point and it made this</text>
  <text start="426.11" dur="3.33">surge to forty six point nine percent</text>
  <text start="427.759" dur="3.901">because what is happening out in the</text>
  <text start="429.44" dur="6.27">Middle East out in Eastern Europe</text>
  <text start="431.66" dur="7.8">Pacific so right now factory orders they</text>
  <text start="435.71" dur="7.92">are flashing a deep red recession /</text>
  <text start="439.46" dur="12.9">depression indicator it is a complete</text>
  <text start="443.63" dur="14.04">and utter disaster and orders they are</text>
  <text start="452.36" dur="9.53">factory they&amp;#39;re going nowhere and this</text>
  <text start="457.67" dur="6.78">now is seeping into the service sector</text>
  <text start="461.89" dur="5.26">because remember when they told us and</text>
  <text start="464.45" dur="4.29">we put it on this when the the United</text>
  <text start="467.15" dur="4.41">States has any manufacturer anymore it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.74" dur="4.29">a strong service-oriented country and</text>
  <text start="471.56" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s what we need to be looking at</text>
  <text start="473.03" dur="7.2">well we know a country cannot survive on</text>
  <text start="475.22" dur="8.52">service it needs the manufacturing well</text>
  <text start="480.23" dur="7.14">as goes us manufacturing so does us</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="6.75">services and we see the u.s. services</text>
  <text start="487.37" dur="6.39">PMI drop to 50 4.3 the lowest since</text>
  <text start="490.49" dur="4.74">january of 2015 the output and new</text>
  <text start="493.76" dur="5.03">business growth slumped to about 11</text>
  <text start="495.23" dur="7.05">month lows optimism completely dropped</text>
  <text start="498.79" dur="5.44">input costs inflation continued to</text>
  <text start="502.28" dur="4.26">moderate as suggested the pace of hiring</text>
  <text start="504.23" dur="4.65">has slowed since early in the year as</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="6.929">Ben&amp;#39;s businesses have become more</text>
  <text start="508.88" dur="8.33">cautious at this point so we see that</text>
  <text start="513.469" dur="6.721">services is now catching up with</text>
  <text start="517.21" dur="6.579">manufacturing and they&amp;#39;re both declining</text>
  <text start="520.19" dur="7.41">market says the following service sector</text>
  <text start="523.789" dur="7.711">losing momentum alongside a stalling of</text>
  <text start="527.6" dur="6.06">growth in the manufacturing sector the</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="5.07">pace of hiring has slowed since early in</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="8.22">the year as businesses have become more</text>
  <text start="536.57" dur="8.82">cautious it would appear right now that</text>
  <text start="541.88" dur="9.18">the service economy is not going to save</text>
  <text start="545.39" dur="7.98">us there meme has just collapsed so now</text>
  <text start="551.06" dur="4.86">what are they going to say what are they</text>
  <text start="553.37" dur="5.49">going to use at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.92" dur="5.52">running out of ammunition they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.86" dur="4.41">running out of things to say this is a</text>
  <text start="561.44" dur="3.4">recovery so everything they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="563.27" dur="3.64">talking about in this illusion</text>
  <text start="564.84" dur="8.04">it&amp;#39;s disintegrating it&amp;#39;s falling apart</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="9.09">it&amp;#39;s collapsing and at this point this</text>
  <text start="572.88" dur="4.62">whole system does not match up to what</text>
  <text start="576" dur="4.62">the government and the central bank is</text>
  <text start="577.5" dur="7.17">telling us and we&amp;#39;re starting to hear</text>
  <text start="580.62" dur="8.18">that this growth that is supposedly</text>
  <text start="584.67" dur="8.55">coming it&amp;#39;s not coming at all actually</text>
  <text start="588.8" dur="6.49">everyone is saying that global growth is</text>
  <text start="593.22" dur="4.77">going to be slowing and what that really</text>
  <text start="595.29" dur="6.06">means is that we are in the collapse</text>
  <text start="597.99" dur="4.83">stage here because every time they tell</text>
  <text start="601.35" dur="3.09">us so it&amp;#39;s going to slow a little bit</text>
  <text start="602.82" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re going to go through a little</text>
  <text start="604.44" dur="3.63">speed bumps that means it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="606.57" dur="4.17">a lot worse than what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="608.07" dur="5.28">saying the World Bank just came out and</text>
  <text start="610.74" dur="5.91">said the same exact thing so the UN IMF</text>
  <text start="613.35" dur="6.29">World Bank all saying the same thing at</text>
  <text start="616.65" dur="8.46">this point multiply that by a hundred</text>
  <text start="619.64" dur="8.32">that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re headed now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="625.11" dur="5.31">very interesting is that standard &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="627.96" dur="4.83">poor&amp;#39;s / the credit ratings of a hundred</text>
  <text start="630.42" dur="6.39">and twelve corporations around the globe</text>
  <text start="632.79" dur="7.83">to default d or selective default SD in</text>
  <text start="636.81" dur="10.23">2015 this is the highest number of</text>
  <text start="640.62" dur="9.32">global defaults since 2009 when an</text>
  <text start="647.04" dur="5.88">unthinkable 268 companies defaulted and</text>
  <text start="649.94" dur="6.52">not far behind the second highest</text>
  <text start="652.92" dur="6.09">default default tally of 125 and 2000</text>
  <text start="656.46" dur="6.81">date so right now we&amp;#39;re at a hundred and</text>
  <text start="659.01" dur="5.97">twelve in this recovery something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="663.27" dur="4.74">wrong wouldn&amp;#39;t you think well don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="664.98" dur="8.63">worry it has to be other countries it</text>
  <text start="668.01" dur="9.62">can&amp;#39;t be the US and you would think that</text>
  <text start="673.61" dur="11.68">it would be like Russia Brazil China</text>
  <text start="677.63" dur="12.43">Argentina where they downgraded the</text>
  <text start="685.29" dur="7.55">companies but guess what it was most of</text>
  <text start="690.06" dur="7.95">the companies here in the United States</text>
  <text start="692.84" dur="5.65">they ranked high on the list here in the</text>
  <text start="698.01" dur="6.9">US</text>
  <text start="698.49" dur="9.44">in total 66 defaulters were us issuers</text>
  <text start="704.91" dur="11.04">up to one hundred percent from 33 and</text>
  <text start="707.93" dur="11.52">2014 so what does that tell us it tells</text>
  <text start="715.95" dur="6.69">us there&amp;#39;s a big problem on the way if</text>
  <text start="719.45" dur="7.78">we compare this to what happened back in</text>
  <text start="722.64" dur="8.4">two thousand eight we are at the point</text>
  <text start="727.23" dur="8.34">of where we were back in 2008 basically</text>
  <text start="731.04" dur="10.26">the economy at this time has gone</text>
  <text start="735.57" dur="8.31">nowhere actually it&amp;#39;s much worse think</text>
  <text start="741.3" dur="9.84">about this for a second the stock market</text>
  <text start="743.88" dur="14.269">is at all-time highs manufacturing bolt</text>
  <text start="751.14" dur="13.91">of dry index retail GDP unemployment is</text>
  <text start="758.149" dur="12.901">a lot worse now than it was in 2009 and</text>
  <text start="765.05" dur="8.5">the market already fell in 2009 now</text>
  <text start="771.05" dur="6.97">we&amp;#39;re at the same level but the market</text>
  <text start="773.55" dur="8.58">is at all-time highs so when this market</text>
  <text start="778.02" dur="9.33">comes down what do you think is going to</text>
  <text start="782.13" dur="9.3">happen it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="787.35" dur="8.549">disaster that is what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="791.43" dur="7.38">and remember if we&amp;#39;re at the same point</text>
  <text start="795.899" dur="5.671">right now or much worse and we are much</text>
  <text start="798.81" dur="6.54">worse because all of this is one big</text>
  <text start="801.57" dur="6.48">illusionary bubble when this market</text>
  <text start="805.35" dur="6.06">comes down it&amp;#39;s going to bring</text>
  <text start="808.05" dur="8.039">everything down further it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="811.41" dur="10.59">so bad that people are not going to</text>
  <text start="816.089" dur="7.921">understand what just happened and this</text>
  <text start="822" dur="4.86">is what I&amp;#39;ve been talking about when we</text>
  <text start="824.01" dur="5.16">say get prepared you don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="826.86" dur="5.219">one of those people out there running</text>
  <text start="829.17" dur="3.12">around saying I gotta run to the Super</text>
  <text start="832.079" dur="2.82">more</text>
  <text start="832.29" dur="5.46">before capital controls I gotta get a</text>
  <text start="834.899" dur="7.531">weapon because they&amp;#39;re now looters on</text>
  <text start="837.75" dur="7.649">the streets I need gold and silver but I</text>
  <text start="842.43" dur="6.99">can&amp;#39;t get any at this point I wish I put</text>
