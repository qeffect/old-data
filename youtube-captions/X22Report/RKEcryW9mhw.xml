  <text start="46.25" dur="5.129">economic collapse financial news now at</text>
  <text start="49.37" dur="5.28">this point we realized that this entire</text>
  <text start="51.379" dur="5.011">economy is one gigantic illusion and the</text>
  <text start="54.65" dur="3.81">president&amp;#39;s getting caught up in all of</text>
  <text start="56.39" dur="4.58">this because what we&amp;#39;re seeing today is</text>
  <text start="58.46" dur="5.25">that the economy isn&amp;#39;t doing as well as</text>
  <text start="60.97" dur="4.84">they were forecasting well it really</text>
  <text start="63.71" dur="5.58">never does as well as they forecast it</text>
  <text start="65.81" dur="6.33">always slides down and declines in what</text>
  <text start="69.29" dur="4.2">they predict and they&amp;#39;ve been predicting</text>
  <text start="72.14" dur="3.99">that this economy&amp;#39;s going to be taking</text>
  <text start="73.49" dur="6.09">off any day now and we&amp;#39;re realizing that</text>
  <text start="76.13" dur="6.66">corporations we&amp;#39;re realizing that retail</text>
  <text start="79.58" dur="7.2">sales we&amp;#39;re realizing housing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="82.79" dur="6.18">realizing GDP unemployment it is all in</text>
  <text start="86.78" dur="5.39">decline right now and all of this has</text>
  <text start="88.97" dur="6.74">been built up on illusion manipulation</text>
  <text start="92.17" dur="7.39">bubbles and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="95.71" dur="6.64">corporations they have no real way right</text>
  <text start="99.56" dur="5.58">now of generating organic growth in this</text>
  <text start="102.35" dur="6.33">type of economy what are they relying on</text>
  <text start="105.14" dur="6.6">well they&amp;#39;re relying on two things two</text>
  <text start="108.68" dur="5.12">Buescher boost their share prices by</text>
  <text start="111.74" dur="4.59">courtesy of the central banks and</text>
  <text start="113.8" dur="5.68">debt-funded buybacks courtesy of the</text>
  <text start="116.33" dur="5.22">central banks and all the newly created</text>
  <text start="119.48" dur="4.62">debt in the 20th century has gone for</text>
  <text start="121.55" dur="4.44">just one thing to fund stock buybacks</text>
  <text start="124.1" dur="3.84">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing because</text>
  <text start="125.99" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re seeing the corporations they do</text>
  <text start="127.94" dur="6.42">not have the sales to support how these</text>
  <text start="132.23" dur="5.7">companies are reporting they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="134.36" dur="7.23">and if you really think about it every</text>
  <text start="137.93" dur="6.51">finance student realizes that no firm</text>
  <text start="141.59" dur="4.83">which has to borrow more cash than it is</text>
  <text start="144.44" dur="5.46">able to produce from its core operation</text>
  <text start="146.42" dur="7.349">it is completely unsustainable business</text>
  <text start="149.9" dur="6.949">model it cannot work now if the Fed</text>
  <text start="153.769" dur="5.101">raises the rate what happens well</text>
  <text start="156.849" dur="3.881">companies are going to be in a lot of</text>
  <text start="158.87" dur="4.48">trouble and we&amp;#39;re going to see massive</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="3.67">cost-cutting we&amp;#39;re going to see layoffs</text>
  <text start="163.35" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of mass</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="3.84">defaults and not just cool with</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="3.42">corporations we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="168.24" dur="4.1">with governments around the world we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="170.46" dur="4.17">going to see this with the US government</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="4.99">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="174.63" dur="4.23">things are rapidly falling apart they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="5.06">trying to keep this illusion alive</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="7.32">chugging along and it&amp;#39;s losing steam</text>
  <text start="182.39" dur="7.6">because the central bankers can only do</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="5.4">so much this is a central banker economy</text>
  <text start="189.99" dur="4.71">this is not a people&amp;#39;s economy I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="191.58" dur="5.19">this before people are nervous afraid</text>
  <text start="194.7" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re not finding the pie paying jobs</text>
  <text start="196.77" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re getting low paying jobs if they</text>
  <text start="198.09" dur="3.21">find one at all they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="199.98" dur="2.97">discretionary funds to go out there and</text>
  <text start="201.3" dur="4.14">say hey you know what I want that nice</text>
  <text start="202.95" dur="4.32">big ticket item they&amp;#39;re just not doing</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="3.75">it they&amp;#39;re not going out and purchasing</text>
  <text start="207.27" dur="5.01">the items in retail this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="209.19" dur="5.28">seeing everything contract now recently</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;ve seen a bump up in the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="214.47" dur="3.63">Index it has hit seven hundred and ten</text>
  <text start="216.54" dur="3.42">points and I think what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="218.1" dur="3.24">right now it is hit the top point now if</text>
  <text start="219.96" dur="3.84">we look back in time at the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="6.51">Index we noticed around this time</text>
  <text start="223.8" dur="6.18">anywhere from april to about june we see</text>
  <text start="227.85" dur="5.52">this seasonal bump up of the bowl to dry</text>
  <text start="229.98" dur="5.13">index and this time it is hit 710 but we</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="3.69">see it&amp;#39;s coming down Five Points now and</text>
  <text start="235.11" dur="3.33">I think at this point what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="3.15">to see is maybe another little bump up</text>
  <text start="238.44" dur="3.75">but I think if it follows the pattern</text>
  <text start="240.21" dur="3.66">that has done in the past we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="242.19" dur="5.73">be heading straight down once again and</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="5.52">this time it is going to hit hard in the</text>
  <text start="247.92" dur="3.57">decline because it&amp;#39;s going to go down</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="5.16">really really far it&amp;#39;s not going to stop</text>
  <text start="251.49" dur="4.8">at 800 points or 700 points like it did</text>
  <text start="254.55" dur="4.35">before because we&amp;#39;re at 700 points right</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="4.65">now it&amp;#39;s going to go back down to 43</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="4.2">around that area and we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="4.23">to watch that very very carefully now</text>
  <text start="263.1" dur="5.37">the be EA reported that the US economy</text>
  <text start="265.17" dur="5.28">grew at about 0.5% annualized rate in</text>
  <text start="268.47" dur="3.3">the first quarter well they only they</text>
  <text start="270.45" dur="3.45">thought it was going to grow about 0.7%</text>
  <text start="271.77" dur="4.89">and it came in at point five percent</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="6.51">which is absolutely awful you have to</text>
  <text start="276.66" dur="7.77">remember this number is the manipulated</text>
  <text start="280.41" dur="6.72">number real GDP is in the negative now</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="4.38">we can see that it has grown half the</text>
  <text start="287.13" dur="4.02">rate recorded in the fourth quarter and</text>
  <text start="288.81" dur="6.18">this is the lowest quarterly rate since</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="6.019">q1 of 2014 and it is also the third</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="3.59">consecutive quarter of gdp decline</text>
  <text start="297.169" dur="5.22">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="298.58" dur="8.369">downtrend of gdp at this point because</text>
  <text start="302.389" dur="8.131">things are rapidly deteriorating so the</text>
  <text start="306.949" dur="7.231">question is what did americans spend</text>
  <text start="310.52" dur="5.669">their money on well they spent their</text>
  <text start="314.18" dur="5.039">money on recreational vehicles like</text>
  <text start="316.189" dur="5.31">campers and they also spent a lot of</text>
  <text start="319.219" dur="6.54">their money guess what on health care</text>
  <text start="321.499" dur="6.211">and these were the two biggest things</text>
  <text start="325.759" dur="3.69">and then after that was housing and</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="4.65">utilities because you need a place to</text>
  <text start="329.449" dur="4.83">live and we see food and beverage but</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="4.29">things that are in the negative we see</text>
  <text start="334.279" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s motor vehicles clothing and other</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="5.039">durable goods like washers and dryers</text>
  <text start="339.199" dur="5.761">and high ticket large ticket items and</text>
  <text start="341.689" dur="5.13">we can see right now is maybe all these</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="3.239">people that are being laid off all these</text>
  <text start="346.819" dur="4.671">people who can&amp;#39;t pay for their houses</text>
  <text start="348.199" dur="6.27">anymore maybe they&amp;#39;re buying RVs campers</text>
  <text start="351.49" dur="5.38">to live in those instead so they can</text>
  <text start="354.469" dur="5.1">move around they don&amp;#39;t need to be in one</text>
  <text start="356.87" dur="5.06">place instead of paying for the high</text>
  <text start="359.569" dur="6.09">rent because we notice that rent is</text>
  <text start="361.93" dur="5.199">skyrocketing at this time now something</text>
  <text start="365.659" dur="3.72">very interesting with real estate we</text>
  <text start="367.129" dur="4.201">know that prices are coming down we</text>
  <text start="369.379" dur="4.831">realize that the central bank has been</text>
  <text start="371.33" dur="8.78">pumping up the entire market convincing</text>
  <text start="374.21" dur="8.759">us that the housing market is doing well</text>
  <text start="380.11" dur="5.919">which we know it is not at this point</text>
  <text start="382.969" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s actually rapidly falling apart home</text>
  <text start="386.029" dur="6.331">ownership is at the at its lowest point</text>
  <text start="387.919" dur="7.381">since way way back in the 70s and if we</text>
  <text start="392.36" dur="7.079">look at the data which is very</text>
  <text start="395.3" dur="6.539">interesting in March of 2005 52,000 new</text>
  <text start="399.439" dur="5.31">homes were sold at prices less than two</text>
  <text start="401.839" dur="5.341">hundred thousand dollars now at the</text>
  <text start="404.749" dur="6.15">bottom of the crash in March of 2009</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="6.329">that number dropped to 14,000 now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.899" dur="5.7">understandable because back in 2005</text>
  <text start="413.509" dur="5.22">going up to two thousand seven a lot of</text>
  <text start="416.599" dur="4.44">people were purchasing homes the economy</text>
  <text start="418.729" dur="5.46">was doing well people felt good they all</text>
  <text start="421.039" dur="5.31">have everyone had jobs and things were</text>
  <text start="424.189" dur="4.621">chugging along and then things started</text>
  <text start="426.349" dur="4.651">to fall apart and then we hit the Great</text>
  <text start="428.81" dur="3.6">Recession in 2009 and of course</text>
  <text start="431" dur="4.4">that number dropped down dramatically</text>
  <text start="432.41" dur="6.12">because housing completely crashed and</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="5.83">the reason why I say this is if it was</text>
  <text start="438.53" dur="8.58">this bad back in 2009 and that was a</text>
  <text start="441.23" dur="8.55">great recession today we have those same</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="7.02">homes who were which are under 200,000</text>
  <text start="449.78" dur="9.78">the total number of units in March that</text>
  <text start="454.13" dur="9.99">are sold were 9,000 so let&amp;#39;s get this</text>
  <text start="459.56" dur="6.39">straight here in 2005 of March when we</text>
  <text start="464.12" dur="3.12">were almost around the height of the</text>
  <text start="465.95" dur="4.32">market moving into the height of the</text>
  <text start="467.24" dur="7.05">market we sold about 52,000 homes for</text>
  <text start="470.27" dur="5.88">those houses 200,000 and under at the</text>
  <text start="474.29" dur="5.43">crash the Great Recession in march two</text>
  <text start="476.15" dur="6.03">thousand nine it dropped to 14,000 this</text>
  <text start="479.72" dur="4.02">recovery that the president kit</text>
  <text start="482.18" dur="5.19">continually tells us in the central bank</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="9.99">continually tells us homes under 200,000</text>
  <text start="487.37" dur="11.609">is at 9,000 so how possibly can the real</text>
  <text start="493.73" dur="8.249">estate market be improving it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="498.979" dur="7.171">because what they did is they went to</text>
  <text start="501.979" dur="6.511">select cities they went to hedge fund&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.15" dur="5.15">investment companies foreign investors</text>
  <text start="508.49" dur="5.91">and said listen take the free money</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="5.71">invest in these areas drive the prices</text>
  <text start="514.4" dur="4.319">up they turned around to the banks and</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="3.99">said hey you know those foreclosures you</text>
  <text start="518.719" dur="5.13">have don&amp;#39;t release them to the market</text>
  <text start="521" dur="5.19">keep them let the people live there</text>
  <text start="523.849" dur="4.051">because the less homes that are on the</text>
  <text start="526.19" dur="5.52">market guess what happened to the price</text>
  <text start="527.9" dur="6.27">that&amp;#39;s right it goes up and don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="531.71" dur="3.9">about all the toxic real estate the feds</text>
  <text start="534.17" dur="3.39">going to come in and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="3.9">purchase about you know three four</text>
  <text start="537.56" dur="4.89">trillion dollars worth and take it off</text>
  <text start="539.51" dur="6.12">the books of the banks and we can see</text>
  <text start="542.45" dur="5.73">right now that this is exactly what has</text>
  <text start="545.63" dur="4.74">happened and the everyday person who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.18" dur="5.52">out there purchasing homes guess what</text>
  <text start="550.37" dur="5.36">they can&amp;#39;t do it this is why the</text>
  <text start="553.7" dur="6.389">mortgage departments have laid off</text>
  <text start="555.73" dur="6.67">thousands upon thousands of people so</text>
  <text start="560.089" dur="4.281">when we look at this economy we have no</text>
  <text start="562.4" dur="5.3">housing recovery we have</text>
  <text start="564.37" dur="4.83">retail recovery the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="567.7" dur="5.16">are completely manipulated we know</text>
  <text start="569.2" dur="5.19">unemployment is around 23 to 30 percent</text>
  <text start="572.86" dur="6.99">it all depends on the calculation that</text>
  <text start="574.39" dur="7.35">you use a lot of people in that mix they</text>
  <text start="579.85" dur="5.19">went from a high paying job to a low</text>
  <text start="581.74" dur="6.48">paying job and they can barely make ends</text>
  <text start="585.04" dur="6.75">meet and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="588.22" dur="9.83">homeownership right now it is in a</text>
  <text start="591.79" dur="9.33">decline it is slid from 63.8 to 63.5</text>
  <text start="598.05" dur="4.75">it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse so who owns</text>
  <text start="601.12" dur="4.38">all these homes in this fantastic</text>
  <text start="602.8" dur="6.66">recovery that&amp;#39;s not the American people</text>
  <text start="605.5" dur="4.98">know who is it it&amp;#39;s all the hedge funds</text>
  <text start="609.46" dur="2.819">and investment companies that are</text>
  <text start="610.48" dur="3.06">holding on to them and they are renting</text>
  <text start="612.279" dur="6.181">them out because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="613.54" dur="7.38">now rent is skyrocketing if we look at</text>
  <text start="618.46" dur="5.25">it in inflation terms it is up anywhere</text>
  <text start="620.92" dur="3.84">between eight to fifteen percent maybe</text>
  <text start="623.71" dur="5.569">that&amp;#39;s where they&amp;#39;re hiding the</text>
  <text start="624.76" dur="8.03">inflation and we&amp;#39;re realizing that</text>
  <text start="629.279" dur="6.491">owner-occupied houses is declining and</text>
  <text start="632.79" dur="4.6">renter occupied houses is increasing and</text>
  <text start="635.77" dur="3.33">then we have those people are saying you</text>
  <text start="637.39" dur="3.99">know something I&amp;#39;m just going to buy a</text>
  <text start="639.1" dur="6.51">recreational vehicle and I&amp;#39;m not even</text>
  <text start="641.38" dur="6.86">going to worry about that and we see at</text>
  <text start="645.61" dur="9.27">this point in time that this entire</text>
  <text start="648.24" dur="11.49">economy it is flatlining now Obama was</text>
  <text start="654.88" dur="9.899">put on the spot today he had to explain</text>
  <text start="659.73" dur="7.6">why the economy was weak because the job</text>
  <text start="664.779" dur="4.951">growth is incredible we&amp;#39;re down to five</text>
  <text start="667.33" dur="5.04">percent actually at one point we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="669.73" dur="3.9">four point nine percent and I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="672.37" dur="2.7">be surprised if they try to push it down</text>
  <text start="673.63" dur="5.78">to four point eight percent right before</text>

  <text start="775.8" dur="6.88">they can&amp;#39;t do anything about it they</text>
  <text start="780.34" dur="4.95">can&amp;#39;t go out and force people to spend</text>

  <text start="819.19" dur="5.64">what is happening right now and this is</text>
