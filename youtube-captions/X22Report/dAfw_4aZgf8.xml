  <text start="56.41" dur="5.22">november seventeenth 2016 and totally</text>
  <text start="59.44" dur="4.5">episode is foreign central banks are</text>
  <text start="61.63" dur="5.61">dumping us treasuries at an alarming</text>
  <text start="63.94" dur="6.24">rate let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="67.24" dur="5.16">collapse financial news now yesterday I</text>
  <text start="70.18" dur="7.02">was talking about a counselor society</text>
  <text start="72.4" dur="6.81">and I mentioned how Australia banking</text>
  <text start="77.2" dur="5.1">giant ubs they proposed to eliminate</text>
  <text start="79.21" dur="5.909">Australia&amp;#39;s 105 hundred-dollar bill well</text>
  <text start="82.3" dur="4.319">I made a mistake why did I say five</text>
  <text start="85.119" dur="3.541">hundred dollars I don&amp;#39;t know because in</text>
  <text start="86.619" dur="5.371">my notes I have it as one hundred and</text>
  <text start="88.66" dur="4.89">fifty dollar bills so I just want to</text>
  <text start="91.99" dur="4.47">make that correction there is no five</text>
  <text start="93.55" dur="8.55">hundred dollar bill it is a fifty-dollar</text>
  <text start="96.46" dur="8.28">bill now what we&amp;#39;re seeing today in the</text>
  <text start="102.1" dur="6.269">economy is that the u.s. government the</text>
  <text start="104.74" dur="5.76">central bankers they are continually</text>
  <text start="108.369" dur="5.101">trying to push the idea that this</text>
  <text start="110.5" dur="5.64">economy has completely recovered and</text>
  <text start="113.47" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re doing this on purpose Obama is</text>
  <text start="116.14" dur="4.08">still in office they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="118.33" dur="3.54">to think that ooh the economy is</text>
  <text start="120.22" dur="3.39">starting to fall apart actually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="121.87" dur="5.37">going to try to boost it as much as they</text>
  <text start="123.61" dur="5.879">possibly can up until January and then</text>
  <text start="127.24" dur="3.57">after that they might wait a month or</text>
  <text start="129.489" dur="4.381">two they&amp;#39;re going to start letting it</text>
  <text start="130.81" dur="6.42">slide because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="133.87" dur="5.73">now is that they want to make sure and</text>
  <text start="137.23" dur="6.33">Obama wants to make sure that the</text>
  <text start="139.6" dur="8.4">economy stays afloat the illusion is</text>
  <text start="143.56" dur="6.179">kept alive while he is in office and we</text>
  <text start="148" dur="4.98">can see this by the data that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="149.739" dur="4.521">out it&amp;#39;s completely manipulated and most</text>
  <text start="152.98" dur="3.21">of it doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense anymore</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="4.75">you&amp;#39;re trying to tell us that the</text>
  <text start="156.19" dur="5.16">initial jobless claims well they are the</text>
  <text start="159.01" dur="6.24">lowest that we&amp;#39;ve ever seen in 43 years</text>
  <text start="161.35" dur="7.02">and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="165.25" dur="6.78">people aren&amp;#39;t getting laid off nobody is</text>
  <text start="168.37" dur="5.79">applying for unemployment everything is</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="4.17">perfect I mean this is the lowest</text>
  <text start="174.16" dur="6.09">initial jobless claims since november of</text>
  <text start="176.2" dur="5.82">1973 but what&amp;#39;s very interesting when we</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="6.87">look at initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="182.02" dur="10.26">is that every time they hit the low</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="10.05">point all of a sudden we go into a</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="7.47">recession and if we go back in years we</text>
  <text start="197.17" dur="5.76">see it going all the way back to</text>
  <text start="199.75" dur="6.66">nineteen seventy-three and then all of a</text>
  <text start="202.93" dur="6.72">sudden were in a recession when we go</text>
  <text start="206.41" dur="8.01">back to say 1979 1980 the same thing</text>
  <text start="209.65" dur="6.27">happened when we go forward to nineteen</text>
  <text start="214.42" dur="5.79">eighty nine to nineteen ninety we saw</text>
  <text start="215.92" dur="8.67">the same thing 2000-2001 same exact</text>
  <text start="220.21" dur="8.67">thing 2007 to 2008 we hit a low point</text>
  <text start="224.59" dur="7.95">and boom all of a sudden we were in the</text>
  <text start="228.88" dur="7.77">Great Recession this time around we are</text>
  <text start="232.54" dur="6.39">at the lowest point we have ever seen</text>
  <text start="236.65" dur="4.29">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="238.93" dur="4.74">is each time we go lower and lower and</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="5.88">lower the recession&amp;#39;s are worse and</text>
  <text start="243.67" dur="5.58">worse and worse this time we&amp;#39;re so low</text>
  <text start="246.82" dur="4.26">that this is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="249.25" dur="5.7">depression complete couple collapse</text>
  <text start="251.08" dur="6.45">there&amp;#39;s no way around this and it is a</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="4.23">pattern that we are seeing and while</text>
  <text start="257.53" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us that initial</text>
  <text start="259.18" dur="5.01">jobless claims is that the lowest point</text>

  <text start="283.3" dur="5.16">trouble their new account openings are</text>
  <text start="286.57" dur="6.54">down by forty four percent of course</text>
  <text start="288.46" dur="8.34">they were committing fraud by opening</text>
  <text start="293.11" dur="5.4">fake accounts but of course the bank is</text>

  <text start="303.43" dur="5">percent right now it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="306.28" dur="5.84">disaster</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="6.65">we see that the core CPI remains above</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="7.26">the feds mandated 2% for 12 months as</text>
  <text start="315.08" dur="9.67">the cost of living surges the most since</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="9.09">2007 and we all know that the cost of</text>
  <text start="324.75" dur="6.87">living is continually moving up all you</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="4.53">have to do is go out shopping yes they</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="3.69">dropped a little bit when the gasoline</text>
  <text start="333" dur="4.62">prices dropped but they&amp;#39;re still very</text>
  <text start="335.31" dur="4.08">high and they&amp;#39;re creeping up a little</text>
  <text start="337.62" dur="5.16">bit and what they did was they took</text>
  <text start="339.39" dur="5.31">products and they made them smaller they</text>
  <text start="342.78" dur="6.36">replace products with other ingredients</text>
  <text start="344.7" dur="7.11">cheaper ingredients to get around this</text>
  <text start="349.14" dur="5.16">to make it look like things weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="351.81" dur="6.39">going up in price or I should say that</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="5.4">that a dollar was devalued we see the</text>
  <text start="358.2" dur="3.27">corporate media the US government is out</text>
  <text start="359.7" dur="4.26">there saying that housing starts well</text>
  <text start="361.47" dur="7.14">they smashed all expectations they</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="8.04">surged the most since 1982 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="4.86">incredible how did this happen well just</text>
  <text start="372" dur="3.93">because someone starting a house doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="373.47" dur="5.36">mean it&amp;#39;s going to be completed remember</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="5.37">yesterday we talked about D H Horton and</text>
  <text start="378.83" dur="5.17">we can see there is a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="4.17">cancellations there are a lot of people</text>
  <text start="384" dur="5.52">starting the houses and then all of a</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="5.58">sudden we had to cancel and most likely</text>
  <text start="389.52" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re going to see the same thing but</text>
  <text start="391.05" dur="4.85">very curiously what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="393.06" dur="6.41">now is that as housing starts are</text>
  <text start="395.9" dur="8.41">surging mortgage applications are</text>
  <text start="399.47" dur="9.1">plunging by thirty percent I mean look</text>
  <text start="404.31" dur="7.98">what happens when the rates tick up by a</text>
  <text start="408.57" dur="7.59">little bit everything starts to fall</text>
  <text start="412.29" dur="9.18">apart can you imagine if the rates moved</text>
  <text start="416.16" dur="7.92">up to 4.5 or five percent it would be a</text>
  <text start="421.47" dur="6.09">complete disaster I mean think about</text>
  <text start="424.08" dur="6.51">this for one second here if rates rise</text>
  <text start="427.56" dur="7.26">by one percentage point for example 3.5</text>
  <text start="430.59" dur="7.23">to 4.5 the monthly payment for many</text>
  <text start="434.82" dur="5.28">cash-strapped households completely</text>
  <text start="437.82" dur="3.63">moves at a reach with a two hundred and</text>
  <text start="440.1" dur="2.28">twenty thousand dollar mortgage the</text>
  <text start="441.45" dur="7.59">monthly payment</text>
  <text start="442.38" dur="9.75">jump from 988 to 1115 that&amp;#39;s a hundred</text>
  <text start="449.04" dur="4.38">and twenty seven dollars now if you take</text>
  <text start="452.13" dur="4.65">the two hundred twenty thousand dollar</text>
  <text start="453.42" dur="5.7">mortgage and you double that well guess</text>
  <text start="456.78" dur="5.34">what it gets worse if you triple that</text>
  <text start="459.12" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s even worse than that and four point</text>
  <text start="462.12" dur="4.02">five percent is still very low can you</text>
  <text start="464.07" dur="6.78">imagine if it went to seven or eight</text>
  <text start="466.14" dur="8.31">percent what would happen the whole</text>
  <text start="470.85" dur="6.39">entire housing market would implode on</text>
  <text start="474.45" dur="5.55">itself this is what the central bankers</text>
  <text start="477.24" dur="6.03">have been doing they&amp;#39;ve been keeping the</text>
  <text start="480" dur="6.57">rates very low some places they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="483.27" dur="7.44">negative because they have to they have</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="10.22">no choice because if they let them move</text>
  <text start="490.71" dur="6.08">up the entire system implodes on itself</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="7.63">we see that the TPP the TTIP well it</text>
  <text start="501.18" dur="5.76">looks like it&amp;#39;s dead and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="504.69" dur="5.15">seeing right now is Australia is saying</text>
  <text start="506.94" dur="5.46">okay you know what since the TPP is dead</text>
  <text start="509.84" dur="6.67">we&amp;#39;re going to be looking at China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.4" dur="7.29">trade deal instead and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="6.51">be looking at their free trade deal in</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="5.79">the asia-pacific and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="523.02" dur="5.22">of countries now are saying you know</text>
  <text start="525.48" dur="4.2">something we&amp;#39;re going to go with China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.24" dur="2.61">trade deal and we&amp;#39;re not going to go</text>
  <text start="529.68" dur="2.96">with United States trade deal because</text>
  <text start="530.85" dur="5.46">inside the United States trade deal</text>
  <text start="532.64" dur="6.97">there was a provision where this court</text>
  <text start="536.31" dur="6.51">system would be above this the</text>
  <text start="539.61" dur="6.21">government&amp;#39;s above the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.82" dur="8.27">government court system and they would</text>
  <text start="545.82" dur="9.66">overrule governments allowing the</text>
  <text start="551.09" dur="7.09">globalists the elite the central banks</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="4.38">to have power over these governments and</text>
  <text start="558.18" dur="3.27">many of these countries many of the</text>
  <text start="559.86" dur="4.47">people in these countries saying this is</text>
  <text start="561.45" dur="6.33">not good for us this will remove our</text>
  <text start="564.33" dur="6.21">sovereignty we would be controlled then</text>
  <text start="567.78" dur="4.14">and this is why a lot of these countries</text>
  <text start="570.54" dur="5.26">objected to it I mean there were many</text>
  <text start="571.92" dur="8.44">other reasons but this is one of them</text>
  <text start="575.8" dur="9.719">and we understand that Donald Trump well</text>
  <text start="580.36" dur="9.03">he&amp;#39;s coming into the White House and he</text>
  <text start="585.519" dur="6.661">needs to do one thing and one thing only</text>
  <text start="589.39" dur="5.879">right in the beginning he needs to get</text>
  <text start="592.18" dur="6.63">rid of the central bank I know I said</text>
  <text start="595.269" dur="7.461">this before but we need to know where he</text>
  <text start="598.81" dur="5.91">stands is he with the central bankers or</text>
  <text start="602.73" dur="4.45">isn&amp;#39;t he with the central bankers</text>
  <text start="604.72" dur="5.69">because we can see right now he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="607.18" dur="6.87">really mentioning anything about this</text>
  <text start="610.41" dur="7.299">because remember we are controlled now</text>
  <text start="614.05" dur="8.729">by a foreign entity that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="617.709" dur="9.111">government it&amp;#39;s a corporation where they</text>
  <text start="622.779" dur="9.18">are telling the People&amp;#39;s Government on</text>
  <text start="626.82" dur="8.65">what to do with the economy they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="631.959" dur="7.38">telling the people&amp;#39;s government that you</text>
  <text start="635.47" dur="8.58">must take this currency and you will owe</text>
  <text start="639.339" dur="8.011">us interest on this currency the</text>
  <text start="644.05" dur="6.5">interest on the currency that&amp;#39;s created</text>
  <text start="647.35" dur="7.53">out of thin air that enslaves a</text>
  <text start="650.55" dur="8.05">population to that central bank that</text>
  <text start="654.88" dur="7.8">enslaves a government to that central</text>
  <text start="658.6" dur="6.57">bank and as the debt builds they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="662.68" dur="7.14">get out of it and it gets worse and</text>
  <text start="665.17" dur="7.08">worse and we know that ever since the</text>
  <text start="669.82" dur="6.389">federal reserve was created in 1913 well</text>
  <text start="672.25" dur="7.5">there&amp;#39;s been 18 distinct recessions or</text>
  <text start="676.209" dur="6.12">depressions since that time they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="679.75" dur="6.11">have a good track record it&amp;#39;s time for a</text>
  <text start="682.329" dur="6.361">change it&amp;#39;s time to take back the power</text>
  <text start="685.86" dur="6.01">and many countries are very worried</text>
  <text start="688.69" dur="6.63">about the United States very worried</text>
  <text start="691.87" dur="5.31">about the dollar because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="695.32" dur="4.41">seeing right now is a lot of foreign</text>
  <text start="697.18" dur="8">central banks well they&amp;#39;re liquidating</text>
  <text start="699.73" dur="8.46">us paper they&amp;#39;re dumping Treasuries</text>
  <text start="705.18" dur="4.09">because we&amp;#39;re seeing that they&amp;#39;ve dumped</text>
  <text start="708.19" dur="2.54">about 14</text>
  <text start="709.27" dur="4.8">billion over the course of a week</text>
  <text start="710.73" dur="5.71">pushing the total amount to two point</text>
  <text start="714.07" dur="6.51">seven eight eight trillion which is a</text>
  <text start="716.44" dur="6.78">new post 2012 low so the latest monthly</text>
  <text start="720.58" dur="4.44">Treasury international capital data for</text>
  <text start="723.22" dur="3.51">the month of September which showed that</text>
  <text start="725.02" dur="4.92">the troubling trend presented one month</text>
  <text start="726.73" dur="9.54">ago has accelerated to an unprecedented</text>
  <text start="729.94" dur="10.44">degree so a month ago we saw that there</text>
  <text start="736.27" dur="6.21">was a massive 343 billion in Treasury</text>
  <text start="740.38" dur="4.86">selling by foreign central banks in the</text>
  <text start="742.48" dur="7.14">period between july 2015 and august 2016</text>
  <text start="745.24" dur="7.59">and that was huge back then and while we</text>
  <text start="749.62" dur="5.58">fast forward to today and we look at the</text>
  <text start="752.83" dur="7.44">latest monthly update for the month we</text>
  <text start="755.2" dur="7.47">find that well it is increased it has</text>
  <text start="760.27" dur="7.71">increased to three hundred and seventy</text>
  <text start="762.67" dur="10.11">four billion so we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="767.98" dur="9.09">that they&amp;#39;re accelerating they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="772.78" dur="6.75">dumping of Treasuries because they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="777.07" dur="4.86">little nervous they understand the</text>
  <text start="779.53" dur="6.06">dollar is at its end game the biggest</text>
  <text start="781.93" dur="6.78">sellers not surprising China we see</text>
  <text start="785.59" dur="6.72">Saudi Arabia guess what they are dumping</text>
