  <text start="181.06" dur="3.81">back to sleep</text>
  <text start="182.38" dur="3.99">why do you think the ratings and all</text>
  <text start="184.87" dur="5.07">these mainstream media outlets are</text>
  <text start="186.37" dur="6.75">dropping because people are waking up</text>

  <text start="213.79" dur="5.61">thunderbird and she was put up there as</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="4.95">Person of the Year because they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="221.92" dur="7.2">change global warming whatever they like</text>
  <text start="224.5" dur="6.66">to call it it&amp;#39;s very important remember</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="5.31">the way the deep state in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="231.16" dur="6">media work they don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="8.01">going to lose they&amp;#39;ve never lost in the</text>

  <text start="279.76" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;m not talking about us who we where we</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="5.46">know they&amp;#39;re trying to confuse the</text>
  <text start="284.35" dur="7.14">public to say that these people are the</text>
  <text start="287.32" dur="5.41">ones who do the policy work no the</text>
  <text start="291.49" dur="4.15">president</text>
  <text start="292.73" dur="6.54">dictate the policy the unelected leaders</text>
  <text start="295.64" dur="6.54">follow that policy the unelected leaders</text>
  <text start="299.27" dur="5.67">do not tell the president what the</text>
  <text start="302.18" dur="5.55">policies should be and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="304.94" dur="5.22">guarding anything Trump can remove them</text>
  <text start="307.73" dur="4.8">if they&amp;#39;re not following along so what</text>
  <text start="310.16" dur="5.88">are they really guarding they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.53" dur="5.64">guarding their system that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="316.04" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re doing so they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="318.17" dur="7.79">control the narrative by putting this</text>
  <text start="320.48" dur="8.58">out there and this is failing now today</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="5.05">we&amp;#39;ve had the fake impeachment the</text>
  <text start="329.06" dur="3.24">article of impeachment and the deep</text>
  <text start="331.01" dur="3.6">State the Dems the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="332.3" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re digging their hole deeper and</text>
  <text start="334.61" dur="5.21">deeper they&amp;#39;re exposing themselves but</text>
  <text start="338.42" dur="4.26">this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="339.82" dur="5.56">now that decided he was not going to</text>
  <text start="342.68" dur="5.34">abide by the house rules which calls for</text>
  <text start="345.38" dur="4.05">the minority hearing on impeachment he</text>
  <text start="348.02" dur="2.61">decided you know something which is not</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="4.2">gonna do it we&amp;#39;re not gonna follow the</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="5.82">rules but again this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="4.44">to expose them how do you drain the</text>
  <text start="356.45" dur="4.17">entire swamp well there&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="358.07" dur="4.53">methods the draining the swamp Trump has</text>
  <text start="360.62" dur="4.83">the ability to fire people to have</text>
  <text start="362.6" dur="4.95">people resign those who were elected how</text>
  <text start="365.45" dur="4.89">do you get rid of those individuals you</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="6.12">expose them to the voters you let the</text>
  <text start="370.34" dur="8.07">people decide do you still want this</text>
  <text start="373.67" dur="8.13">type of person in that seat and this is</text>
  <text start="378.41" dur="7.02">part of the plan exposing these</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="6.57">individuals this is not working out well</text>
  <text start="385.43" dur="5.88">for them people are waking up and</text>
  <text start="388.37" dur="6.02">they&amp;#39;re saying yes I might be a Democrat</text>
  <text start="391.31" dur="8.61">but I&amp;#39;m gonna man American first and</text>
  <text start="394.39" dur="9.13">what you&amp;#39;re doing right now is not part</text>
  <text start="399.92" dur="8.34">of the Constitution it&amp;#39;s not what we all</text>
  <text start="403.52" dur="6.27">believe and this should never happen to</text>
  <text start="408.26" dur="4.91">anyone else because if this can be done</text>
  <text start="409.79" dur="6.39">to Trump if there&amp;#39;s a Democratic</text>
  <text start="413.17" dur="6.24">president they could do it to that</text>
  <text start="416.18" dur="6.45">president or any other president and</text>
  <text start="419.41" dur="4.36">people are starting to realize this and</text>
  <text start="422.63" dur="2.63">this is why the ratings for the</text>
  <text start="423.77" dur="3.35">mainstream media are going down</text>
  <text start="425.26" dur="4.26">this is why more and more people are</text>
  <text start="427.12" dur="4.5">saying you know I I&amp;#39;m not following this</text>
  <text start="429.52" dur="3.84">impeachment thing because it makes no</text>
  <text start="431.62" dur="5.1">sense and I&amp;#39;ve been speaking to a lot of</text>
  <text start="433.36" dur="5.34">people Republicans Democrats and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.72" dur="4.5">both on the same page that this whole</text>
  <text start="438.7" dur="4.26">impeachment should have never have</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="3.66">happened now yes I know there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="442.96" dur="3.48">others out there that said that are</text>
  <text start="444.88" dur="4.62">saying yes in peach and Peach and Peach</text>
  <text start="446.44" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re just following along going along</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="3.72">with the narrative especially those</text>
  <text start="451.66" dur="4.98">people who have a lot to lose they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="453.22" dur="6.72">screaming very very loudly but we need</text>
  <text start="456.64" dur="7.83">to understand is that this whole process</text>
  <text start="459.94" dur="7.2">takes time exposure takes time it takes</text>
  <text start="464.47" dur="8.82">time to let the people see what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="467.14" dur="7.79">going on but no matter what the Dems the</text>
  <text start="473.29" dur="4.74">deep state the Meisha media they lose</text>
  <text start="474.93" dur="6.13">why let&amp;#39;s say they vote for impeachment</text>
  <text start="478.03" dur="6.21">it goes to the Senate let&amp;#39;s say there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.06" dur="5.25">a Senate trial we have the boomerang</text>
  <text start="484.24" dur="5.46">effect let&amp;#39;s say they bring it to a vote</text>
  <text start="486.31" dur="7.2">and they decide not to impeach that</text>
  <text start="489.7" dur="7.83">removes all blocks Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="493.51" dur="7.41">can present the criminal case the class</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="6.96">and they can&amp;#39;t say oh they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="500.92" dur="7.47">because we&amp;#39;re trying to impeach that</text>
  <text start="504.49" dur="6.99">block would be completely gone so no</text>
  <text start="508.39" dur="3.63">matter which way they go they are the</text>
  <text start="511.48" dur="4.499">losers</text>
  <text start="512.02" dur="5.91">and remember truth facts will stand up</text>
  <text start="515.979" dur="7.161">to the propaganda any day of the week</text>
  <text start="517.93" dur="10.32">and that&amp;#39;s what Bill Barr dirham</text>
  <text start="523.14" dur="8.83">Horowitz have done they looked at the</text>
  <text start="528.25" dur="6.09">facts period and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="531.97" dur="4.8">present the facts remember it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="534.34" dur="4.89">be documented it&amp;#39;s not gonna be like he</text>
  <text start="536.77" dur="4.68">said she said it&amp;#39;s gonna they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="539.23" dur="5.88">show signatures they&amp;#39;re gonna show the</text>
  <text start="541.45" dur="8.4">actual documentation they&amp;#39;re gonna show</text>
  <text start="545.11" dur="10.23">how and why they did this now very</text>
  <text start="549.85" dur="7.74">interestingly hunter Biden the woman</text>
  <text start="555.34" dur="7.32">that he got pregnant Roberts</text>
  <text start="557.59" dur="8.64">a judge decided that hunter Biden will</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="7.35">be deposed and he will have to answer</text>
  <text start="566.23" dur="7.04">questions about the money that he made</text>
  <text start="570.01" dur="6.42">while he was on the board a barista and</text>
  <text start="573.27" dur="6.759">his other ties to foreign governments</text>
  <text start="576.43" dur="4.159">now think about what Roberts was able to</text>
  <text start="580.029" dur="2.911">do</text>
  <text start="580.589" dur="4.781">Roberts was able to get hunter Biden to</text>
  <text start="582.94" dur="7.29">answer questions under oath about burry</text>
  <text start="585.37" dur="10.23">smih something that Congress the</text>
  <text start="590.23" dur="7.67">Senators have not done and we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="595.6" dur="4.91">going to happen once this information</text>
  <text start="597.9" dur="9.75">filters out one way or another</text>
  <text start="600.51" dur="10.45">the Senators other elected officials</text>
  <text start="607.65" dur="6.49">will get wind of this they&amp;#39;ll want to</text>
  <text start="610.96" dur="4.26">question him and this is when it all</text>
  <text start="614.14" dur="3.72">starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="7.86">now during the fake impeachment Jim</text>
  <text start="617.86" dur="8.54">Jordan he tried to strike article 1 from</text>
  <text start="623.08" dur="7.08">the impeachment resolution now he ripped</text>
  <text start="626.4" dur="5.98">their argument apart but we know they</text>
  <text start="630.16" dur="4.98">have the majority and no matter what</text>
  <text start="632.38" dur="5.459">they tried to do they&amp;#39;re on the losing</text>
  <text start="635.14" dur="6.27">end that they&amp;#39;re the minority but we</text>
  <text start="637.839" dur="7.621">need to remember that article one is</text>
  <text start="641.41" dur="7.64">about abuse of power and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="645.46" dur="6.66">that the evidence does not support this</text>
  <text start="649.05" dur="6.34">remember there was no quid pro quo no</text>
  <text start="652.12" dur="5.46">bribery no extortion Ukraine confirms</text>
  <text start="655.39" dur="4.67">they did not know about the aid when it</text>

  <text start="1782.59" dur="5.159">this all of this will start to come</text>
  <text start="1785.32" dur="6.39">together there&amp;#39;s a reason why they do</text>
  <text start="1787.749" dur="8.04">all of this now as we know Trump is</text>
  <text start="1791.71" dur="6.209">continually having judges appointed to</text>

  <text start="1809.799" dur="6.12">again we need this for a specific reason</text>
  <text start="1812.769" dur="5.27">for the trials and remember they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1815.919" dur="4.681">all going to be military tribunals</text>
  <text start="1818.039" dur="5.35">they&amp;#39;re all there are gonna be some that</text>

  <text start="1823.389" dur="4.101">there are different levels and we can</text>
  <text start="1825.789" dur="5.33">see they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for this</text>
  <text start="1827.49" dur="7.809">all of this is building upon each other</text>
  <text start="1831.119" dur="8.77">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="1835.299" dur="10.11">Justice Department had a huge nationwide</text>
  <text start="1839.889" dur="8.97">sting on NFL players and they are</text>

  <text start="1869.2" dur="5.579">alleged roles in nationwide fraud on</text>
