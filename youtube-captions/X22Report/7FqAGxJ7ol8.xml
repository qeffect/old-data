  <text start="83.11" dur="6.6">pretty flat today but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="85.84" dur="6.92">is that more and more of the private</text>
  <text start="89.71" dur="6.06">western central bank countries they are</text>
  <text start="92.76" dur="6.01">continually contracting and the</text>
  <text start="95.77" dur="5.51">economies are not improving throughout</text>
  <text start="98.77" dur="6.59">Europe we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing in</text>

  <text start="105.36" dur="5.35">total private debt of the Canadian</text>

  <text start="114.06" dur="9.309">after reaching 100 point seven percent</text>
  <text start="117.07" dur="8.82">and we can see that this is happening to</text>
  <text start="123.369" dur="4.951">every single country not just one</text>
  <text start="125.89" dur="8.43">country it&amp;#39;s happening too many of the</text>
  <text start="128.32" dur="12.39">countries where GDP is absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="134.32" dur="11.94">it&amp;#39;s shrinking the debt of the people it</text>
  <text start="140.71" dur="7.08">is continually increasing and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.26" dur="7.35">seeing here in the United States is the</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="9.21">same exact thing the entire system is on</text>
  <text start="153.61" dur="6.75">the verge of imploding when we look at</text>
  <text start="157" dur="5.43">real estate we see that home builders</text>
  <text start="160.36" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re very confident what does that</text>
  <text start="162.43" dur="4.38">really mean it means absolutely not</text>
  <text start="164.17" dur="5.429">because when you look at the actual</text>
  <text start="166.81" dur="6.05">stats we see the housing really has gone</text>
  <text start="169.599" dur="6.631">nowhere it&amp;#39;s flatlined and it&amp;#39;s dropping</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="5.59">well housing starts they plunge by five</text>
  <text start="176.23" dur="3.9">point eight percent month-on-month this</text>
  <text start="178.45" dur="3.93">is the biggest drop in five months</text>
  <text start="180.13" dur="3.84">building permits while they slip by</text>
  <text start="182.38" dur="4.23">point four percent month and month and</text>
  <text start="183.97" dur="5.04">this is the second monthly drop in a row</text>
  <text start="186.61" dur="6.9">and when you look below the surface</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="8.04">things look really bad rental unit</text>
  <text start="193.51" dur="5.16">permits drop to April lows single-family</text>
  <text start="197.05" dur="3.87">housing starts are the worst since</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="5.099">October and they&amp;#39;re down year-on-year</text>
  <text start="200.92" dur="5.22">and when we look at this we see the</text>
  <text start="203.769" dur="5.011">situation is not getting better it is</text>
  <text start="206.14" dur="6.42">getting worse remember when the Atlanta</text>
  <text start="208.78" dur="6.36">Fed came out and they said well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.56" dur="4.95">looking at the third quarter here and we</text>
  <text start="215.14" dur="4.86">think that the third quarter GDP is</text>
  <text start="217.51" dur="4.5">going to be around three-point-six</text>
  <text start="220" dur="4.769">percent it&amp;#39;s on pace to reach</text>
  <text start="222.01" dur="5.88">three-point-six percent might even go as</text>
  <text start="224.769" dur="6.72">high as three point eight percent well</text>
  <text start="227.89" dur="7.14">the Atlanta vet Fed just revised its</text>
  <text start="231.489" dur="6.211">numbers they really looked at the real</text>
  <text start="235.03" dur="4.62">data and they saw yeah this is quite</text>
  <text start="237.7" dur="4.58">impossible so we&amp;#39;ll come out with</text>
  <text start="239.65" dur="5.48">something a little bit more believable</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="5.079">would you believe two-point-nine percent</text>
  <text start="245.13" dur="5.32">because that&amp;#39;s the number they came out</text>
  <text start="247.359" dur="5.611">with right now which means they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="250.45" dur="5.099">to revise this again even that&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="4.29">high because remember the other quarters</text>
  <text start="255.549" dur="5.25">were coming off of what point seven</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="5.13">percent one point one percent there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="3.541">way that the economy grew by</text>
  <text start="262.39" dur="4.02">two-point-nine percent that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="264.34" dur="4.34">the US government central bankers aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="4.02">going to manipulate the statistics</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="4.69">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re going to say whoa</text>
  <text start="270.43" dur="5.34">the people spend they they were out</text>
  <text start="273.37" dur="3.63">there they were spending like crazy now</text>
  <text start="275.77" dur="2.85">of course when you hear spending you</text>
  <text start="277" dur="3.33">think oh people went to the store they</text>
  <text start="278.62" dur="5.19">bought goods know what that really means</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="6.69">is they increased the spending in health</text>
  <text start="283.81" dur="5.1">care that&amp;#39;s included in GDP and we know</text>
  <text start="287.02" dur="5.97">with Obama care premiums are</text>
  <text start="288.91" dur="8.97">skyrocketing we can see that they can</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="6.6">manipulate the inventory ratio in GDP</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="4.74">so they have ways of doing this and they</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="4.98">might make it look like the GDP maybe</text>
  <text start="302.62" dur="4.5">hit one point nine percent but that</text>
  <text start="304.57" dur="4.59">again is a manipulated number so</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="4.5">whatever they come out with we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.16" dur="4.65">going to be manipulated it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="4.55">to be real because we can see with</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="8.45">manufacturing industrial production</text>
  <text start="316.17" dur="11.62">retail it&amp;#39;s all contracting how possibly</text>
  <text start="322.26" dur="7.78">could spending push GDP up because the</text>
  <text start="327.79" dur="6.48">everyday person their spending habits is</text>
  <text start="330.04" dur="6.66">seventy percent of GDP so if stores are</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="4.38">closing retail this contraction people</text>
  <text start="336.7" dur="3.93">are being laid off manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="338.65" dur="6.93">declining industrial production is</text>
  <text start="340.63" dur="9.99">declining how possibly do they can they</text>
  <text start="345.58" dur="10.14">make us believe that the economy is</text>
  <text start="350.62" dur="9.54">doing well and GDP is fine well they</text>
  <text start="355.72" dur="8.7">can&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s completely impossible we are</text>
  <text start="360.16" dur="8.91">getting signals that in the past have</text>
  <text start="364.42" dur="7.98">led to recessions the u.s. profit</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="5.85">recession us nipa margins peaked in the</text>
  <text start="372.4" dur="4.29">second quarter of 2014 and have been on</text>
  <text start="374.92" dur="5.07">declining path for the past eight</text>
  <text start="376.69" dur="5.67">quarters what does this mean while</text>
  <text start="379.99" dur="6.26">falling margins typically lead</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="7.5">corporations to cut back on hiring and</text>
  <text start="386.25" dur="5.74">investment and we already know that this</text>
  <text start="389.86" dur="4.56">is happening because just a couple of</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="4.89">reports ago we talked about the CEOs and</text>
  <text start="394.42" dur="6.21">how thirty-six percent of them said yes</text>
  <text start="396.88" dur="5.73">we will be cutting back on payroll yeah</text>
  <text start="400.63" dur="3.39">the thirty-seven percent said we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="402.61" dur="4.26">going to do anything we&amp;#39;re going to keep</text>
  <text start="404.02" dur="5.1">it the way it is of course when the</text>
  <text start="406.87" dur="3.54">market starts to decline guess what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.12" dur="4.92">going to happen they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="410.41" dur="5.55">laying off people the 12-month change in</text>
  <text start="414.04" dur="6.69">the feds labor market condition index</text>
  <text start="415.96" dur="6.87">has turned negative in August on five</text>
  <text start="420.73" dur="5.4">out of the seven occasions this happened</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="7.8">over the last forty years it&amp;#39;s signaled</text>
  <text start="426.13" dur="5.3">the onset of a recession when</text>
  <text start="430.63" dur="5.21">corporation</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="7.17">cut back on hiring it&amp;#39;s a signal that</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re heading towards a recession temp</text>
  <text start="438.6" dur="4.23">employment growth is below headline</text>
  <text start="440.82" dur="4.2">employment with this is another</text>
  <text start="442.83" dur="7.86">recessionary signal which has happened</text>
  <text start="445.02" dur="7.41">in the past rising default rates we see</text>
  <text start="450.69" dur="3.75">us speculative default rates have risen</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="6.51">to five point seven percent over the</text>
  <text start="454.44" dur="7.88">past 30 years they push meaningfully</text>
  <text start="458.94" dur="6.6">over five percent on only four occasions</text>
  <text start="462.32" dur="9.79">three of which turned into a full</text>
  <text start="465.54" dur="8.72">default cycle and a recession all of</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="5.49">these things that we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past</text>
  <text start="474.26" dur="7.81">tell us that we&amp;#39;re heading for a</text>
  <text start="477.6" dur="7.65">recession and the thing is the central</text>
  <text start="482.07" dur="5.61">bankers they know this they know what</text>
  <text start="485.25" dur="3.81">the real economy is doing they know what</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="3.84">their manipulation is doing where</text>
  <text start="489.06" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re keeping everyone in the illusion</text>
  <text start="491.52" dur="7.23">that the economy is doing well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.28" dur="11.99">keeping this illusion alive long enough</text>
  <text start="498.75" dur="15.48">to bring the system down and crash it</text>
  <text start="506.27" dur="11.26">now they&amp;#39;re doing this not so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="514.23" dur="6.6">blamed they&amp;#39;re doing this so they can</text>
  <text start="517.53" dur="6">point the finger somewhere else they</text>
  <text start="520.83" dur="5.91">know the economy is in a recession /</text>
  <text start="523.53" dur="6.75">depression right now we are in one no</text>
  <text start="526.74" dur="7.38">doubt about it even when we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="530.28" dur="6.6">recession of 2008 going into 2009 the</text>
  <text start="534.12" dur="6.12">government didn&amp;#39;t acknowledge this until</text>
  <text start="536.88" dur="4.71">later on we are in a recession and when</text>
  <text start="540.24" dur="3.2">they go back in time they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="541.59" dur="4.23">say yes the recession actually started</text>
  <text start="543.44" dur="6.88">most likely in the beginning of 2016</text>
  <text start="545.82" dur="5.97">that&amp;#39;s when we entered it now we can see</text>
  <text start="550.32" dur="4.83">that they have many problems out there</text>
  <text start="551.79" dur="7.05">like Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank well</text>
  <text start="555.15" dur="6.6">their derivative book it&amp;#39;s gigantic and</text>
  <text start="558.84" dur="5.85">it looks like they might be cooking</text>
  <text start="561.75" dur="4.67">their derivatives book they might</text>
  <text start="564.69" dur="4.49">be manipulating it to make it look like</text>
  <text start="566.42" dur="6.01">they&amp;#39;re better off than they really are</text>
  <text start="569.18" dur="5.05">but we can see right now no matter how</text>
  <text start="572.43" dur="3.3">much they manipulate that no matter how</text>
  <text start="574.23" dur="3.9">much they make it look like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="8.31">doing much much better they&amp;#39;re not and</text>
  <text start="578.13" dur="8.01">when the derivative market goes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.04" dur="6.69">going to be a chain reaction bank after</text>
  <text start="586.14" dur="6.93">bank after bank italy&amp;#39;s p.m. they</text>
  <text start="590.73" dur="5.55">understand that deutsches bank they have</text>
  <text start="593.07" dur="4.53">an unfixable problem they know that</text>
  <text start="596.28" dur="7.77">there&amp;#39;s going to be a major problem</text>
  <text start="597.6" dur="9.42">coming up and the central bank they</text>
  <text start="604.05" dur="4.95">already know that this is coming they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="607.02" dur="5.16">been letting us know they&amp;#39;re prepared</text>
  <text start="609" dur="5.01">for it and we know from past reports</text>
  <text start="612.18" dur="4.62">that we talked about how they came out</text>
  <text start="614.01" dur="5.13">and they said okay if the United States</text>
  <text start="616.8" dur="3.96">goes into some type of economic crisis</text>
  <text start="619.14" dur="4.56">of research and depression maybe a</text>
  <text start="620.76" dur="5.13">collapse we&amp;#39;re going to start up QE</text>
  <text start="623.7" dur="4.2">again maybe up to four trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="625.89" dur="5.21">or more most likely it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="627.9" dur="7.2">much much more they also talked about</text>
  <text start="631.1" dur="7.86">cashless society now this is going to be</text>
  <text start="635.1" dur="9.09">phase one because they need more tools</text>
  <text start="638.96" dur="7.99">they need more tools to pump up the</text>
  <text start="644.19" dur="4.14">economy to take control the economy so</text>
  <text start="646.95" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re going to have to crash it right</text>
  <text start="648.33" dur="5.13">now to convince the United States</text>
  <text start="651.12" dur="5.49">government and the people around the</text>
  <text start="653.46" dur="5.28">country that we need laws passed and we</text>
  <text start="656.61" dur="5.79">need to give more power to the central</text>
  <text start="658.74" dur="6.06">bank this is where they are headed right</text>
  <text start="662.4" dur="4.74">now and we&amp;#39;re getting another indicator</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="4.95">that yes this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="667.14" dur="6.05">prepared to do we know they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="669.75" dur="7.8">ready for what is about to come because</text>
  <text start="673.19" dur="7.21">Yellen made a speech at Jackson Hole it</text>
  <text start="677.55" dur="6.63">was widely reported and she mentioned</text>
  <text start="680.4" dur="8.61">something in her report as she was</text>
  <text start="684.18" dur="7.29">speaking about footnote 8 which is a</text>
  <text start="689.01" dur="6.329">mathematical formula that could put</text>
  <text start="691.47" dur="6.64">interest rates on autopilot now the Fed</text>
  <text start="695.339" dur="4.801">hasn&amp;#39;t yet followed the rule but</text>
  <text start="698.11" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s there it&amp;#39;s on the table and</text>
  <text start="700.14" dur="5.74">footnote 8 lays the groundwork for</text>
  <text start="702.49" dur="5.33">negative rates I know the Fed has been</text>
  <text start="705.88" dur="4.709">talking about raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="707.82" dur="6.66">but they&amp;#39;re really looking to go</text>
  <text start="710.589" dur="6.951">negative and they can&amp;#39;t just go negative</text>
  <text start="714.48" dur="5.5">they need to do something before that</text>
  <text start="717.54" dur="4.62">they need to raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="719.98" dur="6.47">and if they do raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="722.16" dur="8.41">just like during the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="726.45" dur="6.16">they will bring down the economy but</text>
  <text start="730.57" dur="4.05">they can&amp;#39;t make it look like they did</text>
  <text start="732.61" dur="4.469">this so when they raise interest rates</text>
  <text start="734.62" dur="3.959">we know in the short period of time the</text>
  <text start="737.079" dur="3.57">economy is going to look like it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="738.579" dur="5.041">a little bit better and then what&amp;#39;s</text>
