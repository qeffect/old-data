  <text start="76.289" dur="5.521">back in 2008 and we know that this is</text>
  <text start="79.11" dur="4.53">one gigantic illusion and the central</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="3.96">banks around the world they all</text>
  <text start="83.64" dur="5.25">coordinated with each other and they</text>
  <text start="85.77" dur="5.879">implemented stimulus they implemented</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="5.88">zero or negative interest rates and they</text>
  <text start="91.649" dur="5.041">kept the entire system running for all</text>
  <text start="94.77" dur="5.099">of these years and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="96.69" dur="6.239">right now is the entire system breaking</text>
  <text start="99.869" dur="5.34">down one economic sector at a time and</text>
  <text start="102.929" dur="4.53">it is spreading very very quickly</text>
  <text start="105.209" dur="5.101">now German secretary general the</text>

  <text start="117.479" dur="5.821">getting worse the negative interest</text>
  <text start="119.849" dur="6.811">rates of Draghi and ECB he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="123.3" dur="5.67">they have totally failed he has pointed</text>
  <text start="126.66" dur="5.1">out that despite various EU stress tests</text>
  <text start="128.97" dur="4.2">for banks time and time again they</text>
  <text start="131.76" dur="3.15">continue to fail just like the one the</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="5.039">United States these stress tests were</text>
  <text start="134.91" dur="5.67">put into place to give everyone the</text>
  <text start="138.209" dur="5.581">feeling that everything is going to be</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="5.37">ok because once a disaster hits like the</text>
  <text start="143.79" dur="4.229">Great Recession of 2008 what they</text>
  <text start="145.95" dur="4.319">normally do during these time periods</text>
  <text start="148.019" dur="6.271">they need to make everyone feel better</text>
  <text start="150.269" dur="7.44">more comfortable they need to gain trust</text>
  <text start="154.29" dur="6.33">again so they raise the FDIC insurance</text>
  <text start="157.709" dur="4.981">and they say oh look we&amp;#39;re going to test</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="2.699">these banks as time and this will not</text>
  <text start="162.69" dur="3.329">happen again</text>
  <text start="163.319" dur="4.441">they did this back in 1930 this is when</text>
  <text start="166.019" dur="4.08">they implemented the FDIC insurance</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="4.199">because no one had faith in the banking</text>
  <text start="170.099" dur="4.11">system anymore and they need to bring</text>
  <text start="171.959" dur="4.021">the funds back to the banks so this is</text>
  <text start="174.209" dur="4.741">what they have done they&amp;#39;ve done it</text>
  <text start="175.98" dur="4.62">again in the 2008 crisis and we could</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="3.54">see at this point that these stress</text>
  <text start="180.6" dur="3.09">tests they&amp;#39;re completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="182.49" dur="4.01">false</text>
  <text start="183.69" dur="7.05">and he is out there saying that listen</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="5.68">all this has not worked and we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="190.74" dur="3.21">this fake recovery</text>
  <text start="192.18" dur="3.81">the only thing that&amp;#39;s going to work is</text>
  <text start="193.95" dur="3.39">reforms actually what&amp;#39;s going to work is</text>
  <text start="195.99" dur="3.35">getting rid of these central banks is</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="5.72">getting rid of these this entire</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="8.14">manipulated economy going back to a true</text>
  <text start="203.06" dur="9.82">economy where there&amp;#39;s honest reporting</text>
  <text start="207.48" dur="7.98">honest transactions honest currency what</text>
  <text start="212.88" dur="5.6">we&amp;#39;re seeing today is everything the</text>
  <text start="215.46" dur="5.97">criminal acts of the banking system</text>
  <text start="218.48" dur="5.47">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing now we are</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="4.29">seeing the economy break apart in all</text>
  <text start="223.95" dur="4.22">different areas we know the retail</text>
  <text start="225.72" dur="4.08">sector it is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="228.17" dur="4.21">disaster</text>
  <text start="229.8" dur="5.25">now department stores they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="4.95">hit very very hard and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="235.05" dur="4.59">whatever they possibly can to bring the</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="6.39">customers into the stores they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.64" dur="7.23">looking at huge discount sales they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="5.88">even discounting cosmetics and we see</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="5.13">Lord &amp;amp; Taylor Bloomingdale&amp;#39;s Macy&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="249.6" dur="5.34">many of the other big department stores</text>
  <text start="252" dur="5.1">well they are basically giving 15</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="4.44">percent twenty five percent whatever</text>
  <text start="257.1" dur="5.16">they possibly can do to bring in people</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="5.88">into the stores now what is happening</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="4.77">here is the corporate media is making it</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="3.45">seem like everyone is just well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="4.32">going online and they&amp;#39;re shopping there</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="5.04">well that is true the retail industry</text>
  <text start="271.35" dur="5.36">would be booming right now they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="273.75" dur="6.63">like oh my god look our online sales</text>
  <text start="276.71" dur="5.68">they are fantastic because again Macy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.38" dur="3.24">has their department store and they have</text>
  <text start="282.39" dur="3.63">an online presence</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="5.64">Bloomingdale&amp;#39;s has the same thing Sears</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="8.19">has the same thing every single retailer</text>
  <text start="289.26" dur="7.83">has an online presence now these</text>
  <text start="294.21" dur="4.73">companies they are going bankrupt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.09" dur="5.37">not because oh everyone went to online</text>
  <text start="298.94" dur="5.92">no what is happening here is that people</text>
  <text start="302.46" dur="6.8">aren&amp;#39;t spending the money remember</text>
  <text start="304.86" dur="7.38">online is only 8% of total retail sales</text>
  <text start="309.26" dur="5.2">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a breakdown</text>
  <text start="312.24" dur="3.63">because people don&amp;#39;t have the jobs if</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="2.35">you don&amp;#39;t have the jobs you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="315.87" dur="3.01">the extra money</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="4.38">and a lot of people it&amp;#39;s very difficult</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="4.17">for them to see this I mean coming from</text>
  <text start="321.19" dur="4.56">the younger generation where they&amp;#39;re got</text>
  <text start="323.05" dur="5.01">graduating college coming out of high</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="3.9">school they can&amp;#39;t find those jobs or</text>
  <text start="328.06" dur="4.44">those individuals that have lost their</text>
  <text start="329.65" dur="4.98">jobs they get it but people who are</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="4.56">retired who are receiving a pension</text>
  <text start="334.63" dur="5.34">who&amp;#39;ve made it throughout this entire</text>
  <text start="337.06" dur="5.28">period it&amp;#39;s very difficult for them to</text>
  <text start="339.97" dur="5.34">see it they will see it when all of a</text>
  <text start="342.34" dur="6.95">sudden their pension disappears people</text>
  <text start="345.31" dur="6.78">wake up when it actually affects them</text>
  <text start="349.29" dur="3.82">when it doesn&amp;#39;t affect them and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.09" dur="2.61">say there&amp;#39;s an individual that is</text>
  <text start="353.11" dur="5.309">working in the corporation maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="354.7" dur="5.1">not getting a raise with the cost of</text>
  <text start="358.419" dur="2.551">inflation maybe they&amp;#39;re not getting that</text>
  <text start="359.8" dur="3.33">but they still have their job they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.97" dur="4.14">saying oh yes we I noticed that but</text>
  <text start="363.13" dur="3.6">everything seems to be fine and if</text>
  <text start="365.11" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;re not looking for a job you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="366.73" dur="3.689">know what the job markets really like</text>
  <text start="368.26" dur="3.75">just like if you&amp;#39;re not selling a house</text>
  <text start="370.419" dur="3.481">you really don&amp;#39;t know what the housing</text>
  <text start="372.01" dur="4.05">market is like if you&amp;#39;re on a pension</text>
  <text start="373.9" dur="4.56">and you&amp;#39;re receiving the same amount of</text>
  <text start="376.06" dur="4.56">money each time you really don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="378.46" dur="3.9">what the economy is like yes you can see</text>
  <text start="380.62" dur="4.07">inflation here and there food prices</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="6.42">going up but until these things</text>
  <text start="384.69" dur="6.31">disappear until it affects you you</text>
  <text start="388.78" dur="5.1">really don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="391" dur="5.55">now it has affected millions of people</text>
  <text start="393.88" dur="5.789">think about it over a hundred million</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="6.75">people well they&amp;#39;re still looking for</text>
  <text start="399.669" dur="7.581">jobs the government just doesn&amp;#39;t count</text>
  <text start="403.3" dur="6.96">them so they&amp;#39;re affected they understand</text>
  <text start="407.25" dur="4.63">what is happening and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="410.26" dur="4.26">population when this whole entire system</text>
  <text start="411.88" dur="5.58">comes down they will also understand</text>
  <text start="414.52" dur="5.28">what is going to happen now when we look</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="4.5">at what is happening within the stock</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="5.88">market now we know this is based on one</text>
  <text start="421.96" dur="6.48">gigantic illusion and if you look at</text>
  <text start="425.68" dur="5.25">what is going on in the sp500 and</text>
  <text start="428.44" dur="6">everything else you can see that they</text>
  <text start="430.93" dur="6.03">use some tricky accounting methods to</text>
  <text start="434.44" dur="4.92">make everyone believe that everything is</text>
  <text start="436.96" dur="7.62">perfectly fine everything is great</text>
  <text start="439.36" dur="7.98">now since July of 2012 so over the past</text>
  <text start="444.58" dur="4.8">five years or so the trailing 12-month</text>
  <text start="447.34" dur="3.4">earnings per share of all the companies</text>
  <text start="449.38" dur="4.689">in the S&amp;amp;P 500 index</text>
  <text start="450.74" dur="6.89">that rose around 12% in total or just</text>
  <text start="454.069" dur="8.07">over 2% per year on an average basis or</text>
  <text start="457.63" dur="6.759">barely the rate of inflation these are</text>
  <text start="462.139" dur="4.981">not earnings under the generally</text>
  <text start="464.389" dur="5.821">accepted accounting principles GAAP but</text>
  <text start="467.12" dur="5.22">adjusted earnings as reported by</text>
  <text start="470.21" dur="5.97">companies to make their earnings look</text>
  <text start="472.34" dur="6.5">better not all companies report adjusted</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="6.06">earnings some just stick to gap earnings</text>
  <text start="478.84" dur="6.639">and live with the consequences but many</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="6.32">others are reporting adjusted earnings</text>
  <text start="485.479" dur="7.081">and that&amp;#39;s what wall street propagates</text>
  <text start="488.56" dur="7.449">adjusted earnings adjusted earnings are</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="5.22">earnings with bad stuff adjusted out of</text>
  <text start="496.009" dur="4.681">them it&amp;#39;s almost like looking at your</text>
  <text start="497.78" dur="4.259">own household budget and saying okay we</text>
  <text start="500.69" dur="2.879">don&amp;#39;t have that credit card debt let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.039" dur="3.391">get rid of that we don&amp;#39;t have a car</text>
  <text start="503.569" dur="3.511">payment let&amp;#39;s get rid of that we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="505.43" dur="3.269">going to include that wow we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="5.879">fantastic we have all this extra money</text>
  <text start="508.699" dur="6.691">this is what companies do so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.959" dur="5.341">generally displaying earnings in the</text>
  <text start="515.39" dur="5.43">most favorable light and these adjusted</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="6.81">earnings are now back where they been on</text>
  <text start="520.82" dur="8.13">March 2014 with no growth whatsoever so</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="6.87">even this method is not working this is</text>
  <text start="528.95" dur="4.62">total stagnation even for the adjusted</text>
  <text start="531.98" dur="5.34">earnings and yet over the same three</text>
  <text start="533.57" dur="9.09">plus years the S&amp;amp;P 500 index has soared</text>
  <text start="537.32" dur="7.35">to 33% this is a problem now given that</text>
  <text start="542.66" dur="5.21">there&amp;#39;s been zero earnings growth over</text>
  <text start="544.67" dur="6.18">the past three years even under the most</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="5.08">optimistic adjusted earnings scenario</text>
  <text start="550.85" dur="5.21">and only about 2% per year on average</text>
  <text start="552.95" dur="7.11">over the past five years the S&amp;amp;P 500</text>
  <text start="556.06" dur="6.219">these companies are not high growth</text>
  <text start="560.06" dur="4.769">companies on average they&amp;#39;re stagnating</text>
  <text start="562.279" dur="6.12">companies with stagnating earnings in</text>
  <text start="564.829" dur="5.461">other words earnings they didn&amp;#39;t expand</text>
  <text start="568.399" dur="4.621">the only thing that expanded was the</text>
  <text start="570.29" dur="7.41">multiple of those earnings to the share</text>
  <text start="573.02" dur="7.29">prices the p/e ratio and this is a major</text>
  <text start="577.7" dur="6.69">problem we&amp;#39;re going to see a stock</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="6.84">market tsunami this is like red flow</text>
  <text start="584.39" dur="9.69">flashing lights saying hey there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="587.15" dur="9.48">to be huge huge problems now the Fed is</text>
  <text start="594.08" dur="4.38">out there and we know that Jenny Jung is</text>
  <text start="596.63" dur="4.2">going to present the Fed&amp;#39;s monetary</text>
  <text start="598.46" dur="4.76">report to Congress this week and her</text>
  <text start="600.83" dur="4.68">remarks are already being posted online</text>
  <text start="603.22" dur="4.09">she&amp;#39;s saying that the evaluation</text>
  <text start="605.51" dur="3.42">pressures across a range of assets and</text>
  <text start="607.31" dur="4.19">several indicators of investors risk</text>
  <text start="608.93" dur="7.08">appetite have increased further since</text>
  <text start="611.5" dur="8.77">mid-february so what is she actually</text>
  <text start="616.01" dur="7.2">saying well Yellen right now is clearly</text>
  <text start="620.27" dur="8.04">warning that the Fed sees bubbles in the</text>
  <text start="623.21" dur="7.91">system so she is saying that the</text>
  <text start="628.31" dur="5.31">valuation pressures in the market is</text>
  <text start="631.12" dur="4.06">simply incredible particularly when you</text>
  <text start="633.62" dur="3.84">consider that the Fed has been actively</text>
  <text start="635.18" dur="5.46">propping up stocks for the better part</text>
  <text start="637.46" dur="6.59">of eight years they created these</text>
  <text start="640.64" dur="6.03">bubbles and now they&amp;#39;re saying yes</text>
  <text start="644.05" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re not calling them bubbles but we</text>
  <text start="646.67" dur="6.69">see them and they&amp;#39;re going to pop</text>
  <text start="649.63" dur="5.68">secondly Yellen reiterates the feds</text>
  <text start="653.36" dur="5.25">intention to begin normalizing its</text>
  <text start="655.31" dur="5.79">balance sheet this year now this is an</text>
  <text start="658.61" dur="5.34">absolute game changer for the market as</text>
  <text start="661.1" dur="4.95">it marks the first time in a decade that</text>
  <text start="663.95" dur="4.71">the Fed will be actively withdrawing</text>
  <text start="666.05" dur="4.53">liquidity from the system remember</text>
  <text start="668.66" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing all these stocks</text>
  <text start="670.58" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;ve been pumping up the market</text>
  <text start="672.41" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating everything now</text>
  <text start="675.44" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re trying to let the air out and</text>
  <text start="677.09" dur="5.36">you know what&amp;#39;s going to happen because</text>
  <text start="678.68" dur="5.91">once they start doing this there are no</text>
  <text start="682.45" dur="5.71">retail investors that are going in</text>
  <text start="684.59" dur="7.17">buying all of this stuff to keep the</text>
  <text start="688.16" dur="5.73">market up so the Fed is getting ready to</text>
  <text start="691.76" dur="4.17">pull the plug on the markets what does</text>
  <text start="693.89" dur="5.61">this mean for stocks well we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="695.93" dur="5.97">have the third and worst crisis in 20</text>
  <text start="699.5" dur="5.4">years and if you look at this over time</text>
  <text start="701.9" dur="6.21">you can see that the pattern is exactly</text>
  <text start="704.9" dur="7.34">the same in the year 2000 all of a</text>
  <text start="708.11" dur="8.55">sudden the SP came down in the year 2008</text>
  <text start="712.24" dur="9.04">same thing the SP came down</text>
  <text start="716.66" dur="8.79">and back then the S&amp;amp;P was around 1,600</text>
  <text start="721.28" dur="8.24">today we&amp;#39;re at 24 25 or so around that</text>
  <text start="725.45" dur="7.26">area I mean this fall is going to be</text>
  <text start="729.52" dur="8.14">incredible and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="732.71" dur="7.08">absolutely catastrophic so when we look</text>
  <text start="737.66" dur="5.06">at all of this we can see that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="739.79" dur="5.16">for major problems now Bank of America</text>
  <text start="742.72" dur="4.45">they&amp;#39;ve been looking at what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="744.95" dur="6.93">doing and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="747.17" dur="8.43">why is the Fed suddenly panicking or</text>
  <text start="751.88" dur="6.54">rushing to do this why now why do they</text>
  <text start="755.6" dur="5.07">need to do this well when they looked at</text>
  <text start="758.42" dur="4.59">all of this they noticed a pattern and</text>
  <text start="760.67" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;ve noticed the same exact pattern and</text>
  <text start="763.01" dur="8.58">what is this pattern the over shooting</text>
  <text start="766.73" dur="8.15">on the unemployment rate now the</text>
  <text start="771.59" dur="7.08">unemployment rate has fallen well below</text>
  <text start="774.88" dur="5.59">even the feds revised estimate now</text>
  <text start="778.67" dur="4.95">several Fed officials have pointed out</text>
  <text start="780.47" dur="6.36">that undershooting full employment can</text>
  <text start="783.62" dur="5.94">and will be problematic the Boston Fed</text>
  <text start="786.83" dur="5.61">president Rosen grin argued last summer</text>
  <text start="789.56" dur="5.16">that after hitting a cyclical low there</text>
  <text start="792.44" dur="5.37">are no episodes in which unemployment</text>
  <text start="794.72" dur="4.83">rose a bit and remained stable at its</text>
  <text start="797.81" dur="6.27">natural employment rate rather a</text>
  <text start="799.55" dur="7.29">recession has always followed now when</text>
  <text start="804.08" dur="5.07">we go back in time and we look at the</text>
  <text start="806.84" dur="5.61">unemployment rate and where it overshot</text>
  <text start="809.15" dur="6.92">we can see that this is absolutely true</text>
  <text start="812.45" dur="6.51">if we go all the way back to the 60s as</text>
  <text start="816.07" dur="6.94">soon as this occurred we were in a</text>
  <text start="818.96" dur="5.76">recession around 1970 71 we know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="823.01" dur="5.76">coming off the gold standard we entered</text>
  <text start="824.72" dur="7.83">into a recession 74 75 same thing every</text>
  <text start="828.77" dur="6.54">session fast-forward to the 80s we saw</text>
  <text start="832.55" dur="9.27">the same thing it was a recession 90s</text>
  <text start="835.31" dur="9.98">recession 2000 2001 recession 2008 fits</text>
  <text start="841.82" dur="7.41">the same exact pattern saw a recession</text>
  <text start="845.29" dur="7.21">here we are once again</text>
  <text start="849.23" dur="7.68">and we just overshot the unemployment</text>
  <text start="852.5" dur="6.78">rate which they were predicting and we</text>
  <text start="856.91" dur="5.67">can see at this point that this is a</text>
  <text start="859.28" dur="6.87">problem it fits into a pattern and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.58" dur="6.12">seeing the same consistent pattern not</text>
  <text start="866.15" dur="5.61">just what this indicator but with many</text>
  <text start="868.7" dur="7.53">other indicators a flattening yield</text>
  <text start="871.76" dur="6.87">curve an inverted yield curve and this</text>
  <text start="876.23" dur="6.47">tells us from all of these different</text>
  <text start="878.63" dur="7.22">things that we are headed towards this</text>
  <text start="882.7" dur="7.66">horrific collapse of the system now</text>
  <text start="885.85" dur="7.3">since 2008 they&amp;#39;ve learned how to</text>
  <text start="890.36" dur="6.14">manipulate the system like they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="893.15" dur="6.3">done before they set up a trading desk</text>
  <text start="896.5" dur="6.27">they set the system where they took full</text>
  <text start="899.45" dur="6.3">control because Congress allowed them</text>
  <text start="902.77" dur="4.54">they are allowed to create stimulus like</text>
  <text start="905.75" dur="4.64">there was no tomorrow this has never</text>
  <text start="907.31" dur="8.25">been seen before and they were able to</text>
  <text start="910.39" dur="9.28">continually keep this up over time this</text>
  <text start="915.56" dur="7.34">is why it is lasted so long because the</text>
  <text start="919.67" dur="6.57">manipulation goes far and deep the only</text>
  <text start="922.9" dur="5.44">problem that the Fed has yes they can</text>
  <text start="926.24" dur="5.46">manipulate the stock market they can</text>
  <text start="928.34" dur="6.02">manipulate the unemployment rate along</text>
  <text start="931.7" dur="6.57">with the government they can manipulate</text>
  <text start="934.36" dur="6.73">the creation of currency they can</text>
  <text start="938.27" dur="4.92">manipulate stimulus they can manipulate</text>
  <text start="941.09" dur="4.17">GDP numbers with the help of the</text>
  <text start="943.19" dur="5.9">government they can manipulate all these</text>
  <text start="945.26" dur="9.45">numbers the one thing they can&amp;#39;t do is</text>
  <text start="949.09" dur="9.79">manipulate the real economy the everyday</text>
  <text start="954.71" dur="7.26">economy that people live in they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="958.88" dur="7.74">do it they can&amp;#39;t make people go and</text>
  <text start="961.97" dur="6.96">spend their money have you ever wondered</text>
  <text start="966.62" dur="3.6">why all of a sudden and it&amp;#39;s not all of</text>
  <text start="968.93" dur="3.8">a sudden because we&amp;#39;ve been tracking</text>
  <text start="970.22" dur="6.57">this we knew that retail was bombing</text>
  <text start="972.73" dur="7.24">years ago we saw it coming we reported</text>
  <text start="976.79" dur="5.88">on it each time because we said if</text>
  <text start="979.97" dur="4.32">people don&amp;#39;t have jobs</text>
  <text start="982.67" dur="3.8">is just going to get worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="984.29" dur="6.3">time went on and what have we seen</text>
  <text start="986.47" dur="7.18">exactly that they can&amp;#39;t make people go</text>
  <text start="990.59" dur="5.1">out and spend money they don&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="993.65" dur="3.3">has always been their problem why do you</text>
  <text start="995.69" dur="4.08">think they&amp;#39;re talking about helicopter</text>
  <text start="996.95" dur="4.56">money because they&amp;#39;re hoping they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="999.77" dur="5.55">able to manipulate this system much</text>
  <text start="1001.51" dur="7.83">longer and what is happening here they</text>
  <text start="1005.32" dur="6.54">can&amp;#39;t make companies earn more money yes</text>
  <text start="1009.34" dur="5.04">they can buy back stocks yes they can</text>
  <text start="1011.86" dur="5.16">close plants save money they can layoff</text>
  <text start="1014.38" dur="6.45">people but when you do this it affects</text>
  <text start="1017.02" dur="6.48">the spending of everyday people so the</text>
  <text start="1020.83" dur="5.82">real economy they can&amp;#39;t manipulate and</text>
  <text start="1023.5" dur="6.66">as this continually falls apart like</text>
  <text start="1026.65" dur="6">back in 2008 prior to this back during</text>
  <text start="1030.16" dur="5.7">the Great Recession we saw that the</text>
  <text start="1032.65" dur="5.64">stock market at that time that was at</text>
  <text start="1035.86" dur="5.01">all-time highs back in the Great</text>
  <text start="1038.29" dur="5.34">Depression of 1929 the stock market was</text>
  <text start="1040.87" dur="5.31">like 400 points and they were like wow</text>
  <text start="1043.63" dur="5.01">this is never going to go down back in</text>
  <text start="1046.18" dur="6.24">2008 his 14,000 points here we are at</text>
  <text start="1048.64" dur="6.6">21,000 points the problem is is that</text>
  <text start="1052.42" dur="5.36">they know eventually the manipulation</text>
  <text start="1055.24" dur="7.5">it&amp;#39;s not going to hold because</text>
  <text start="1057.78" dur="8.92">eventually reality sets in the retail</text>
  <text start="1062.74" dur="7.05">apocalypse continues the pension systems</text>
  <text start="1066.7" dur="4.23">in the municipalities and the states in</text>
  <text start="1069.79" dur="6.24">private companies</text>
  <text start="1070.93" dur="7.32">well they implode companies well they</text>
  <text start="1076.03" dur="5.28">can&amp;#39;t make the sales so they have to</text>
  <text start="1078.25" dur="6.6">layoff people they close manufacturing</text>
  <text start="1081.31" dur="6.15">plants and with less people working you</text>
  <text start="1084.85" dur="5.73">have a bigger problem so it started off</text>
  <text start="1087.46" dur="6.45">with manufacturing then they said we</text>
  <text start="1090.58" dur="4.89">were a service country everyone was</text>
  <text start="1093.91" dur="3.93">getting retail jobs and they were</text>
  <text start="1095.47" dur="4.26">getting jobs in the food industry</text>
  <text start="1097.84" dur="3.42">now retails falling apart so all those</text>
  <text start="1099.73" dur="3.06">people but they can&amp;#39;t go to</text>
  <text start="1101.26" dur="3.18">manufacturing because that doesn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="1102.79" dur="2.82">they can&amp;#39;t go to retail because that</text>
  <text start="1104.44" dur="3.12">doesn&amp;#39;t exist anymore</text>
  <text start="1105.61" dur="5.07">where do they go well they can&amp;#39;t go to</text>
  <text start="1107.56" dur="4.41">food and beverage because everything</text>
  <text start="1110.68" dur="4.38">that we&amp;#39;re looking at with restaurants</text>
  <text start="1111.97" dur="4.83">that is also declining so the service</text>
  <text start="1115.06" dur="4.71">industry that were</text>
  <text start="1116.8" dur="6">supposedly our a service country that is</text>
  <text start="1119.77" dur="6.72">now falling apart so basically they have</text>
  <text start="1122.8" dur="6.75">this catastrophic collapse coming and</text>
  <text start="1126.49" dur="5.97">there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do about it</text>
  <text start="1129.55" dur="4.77">they think they can but there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="1132.46" dur="3.69">they can do about it and they know that</text>
  <text start="1134.32" dur="4.2">the system&amp;#39;s eventually going to come</text>
  <text start="1136.15" dur="5.04">down now what they want to do is they</text>
  <text start="1138.52" dur="4.8">want to control it they want to control</text>
  <text start="1141.19" dur="5.1">the narrative they want to tell the</text>
  <text start="1143.32" dur="6.3">story of how this happened and why it</text>
  <text start="1146.29" dur="5.7">happened to of course take all the blame</text>
  <text start="1149.62" dur="3.96">off of them this is what we see</text>
  <text start="1151.99" dur="4.56">happening right now</text>
  <text start="1153.58" dur="5.82">and it&amp;#39;s a sign as they continually</text>
  <text start="1156.55" dur="5.67">suppress gold and silver more and more</text>
  <text start="1159.4" dur="5.58">each day like these little flash crashes</text>
  <text start="1162.22" dur="6.39">as the stock market moves up that</text>
  <text start="1164.98" dur="7.32">actually is a signal that we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1168.61" dur="5.34">closer and closer to the crash that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1172.3" dur="3">what that tells us because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1173.95" dur="3.21">getting more and more nervous and</text>
  <text start="1175.3" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this to make</text>
  <text start="1177.16" dur="5.67">everyone believe so here we are and we</text>
  <text start="1180.31" dur="5.04">can see that things are rapidly falling</text>
