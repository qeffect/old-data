  <text start="62.1" dur="5.94">20th 2017 and the top of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.489" dur="6.42">looks like it&amp;#39;s a go be prepared</text>
  <text start="68.04" dur="6.149">something big is about to happen let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="4.801">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="74.189" dur="4.921">and geopolitical news now we know that</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="4.65">net neutrality is a hot topic and net</text>
  <text start="79.11" dur="4.71">neutrality proponents they&amp;#39;ve claimed</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="8.28">that the regulations combat censorship</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="12.63">yet YouTube happily censored a video of</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="9.42">the FCC Chairman Ajit PI and he was</text>
  <text start="96.45" dur="4.8">defending the net neutrality repeal and</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="6.919">YouTube decided to take it down and we</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="10.1">need to remember Google YouTube Facebook</text>
  <text start="105.979" dur="8.351">Twitter and other social media forms of</text>
  <text start="111.35" dur="5.919">communication they were completely</text>
  <text start="114.33" dur="5.789">exempt from net neutrality well of</text>
  <text start="117.269" dur="4.5">course a lot of them wrote the rules for</text>
  <text start="120.119" dur="4.521">net neutrality I mean net neutrality was</text>
  <text start="121.769" dur="6.3">created by Obama funded by George Soros</text>
  <text start="124.64" dur="6.489">but under a lot of pressure YouTube</text>
  <text start="128.069" dur="4.711">after seven hours decided that they will</text>
  <text start="131.129" dur="3.181">bring the video back up and they</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="5.039">restored it now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="134.31" dur="5.61">we&amp;#39;ve seen Google YouTube Facebook</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="4.581">they&amp;#39;ve been trying all different</text>
  <text start="139.92" dur="5.429">methods by changing the Terms of Service</text>
  <text start="142.4" dur="6.119">continually trying to add fact checkers</text>
  <text start="145.349" dur="5.821">go up with fake news trying to shut down</text>
  <text start="148.519" dur="5.591">the alternative media or anyone that</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="5.459">does not go along with their idea of</text>
  <text start="154.11" dur="4.47">what you should be saying I mean right</text>
  <text start="156.629" dur="3.39">now we see Twitter the vice-president</text>
  <text start="158.58" dur="4.079">public policy and communications for</text>
  <text start="160.019" dur="6.511">Europe we see that she was testifying in</text>
  <text start="162.659" dur="5.39">front of the UK and they were talking</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="5.73">about</text>
  <text start="168.049" dur="5.891">free speech and McSweeney when she</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="3.57">appeared before British politicians this</text>
  <text start="173.94" dur="3.81">week and she was alongside</text>
  <text start="175.83" dur="4.32">representatives from Google of Facebook</text>
  <text start="177.75" dur="4.83">and others saying that they really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="180.15" dur="4.35">control the free speech on their</text>
  <text start="182.58" dur="4.59">platforms now I know all these platforms</text>
  <text start="184.5" dur="4.38">are private I know that they don&amp;#39;t abide</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="4.02">by the Constitution because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="5.16">private companies and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="191.19" dur="5.4">really saying is that they can&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="194.04" dur="5.55">the narrative of the story because when</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="6.18">you think of free speech it&amp;#39;s not oh</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="6.27">this is the okay speech and this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="202.77" dur="6.68">the okay speech all speech is free it</text>
  <text start="205.86" dur="5.849">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what you&amp;#39;re saying if</text>
  <text start="209.45" dur="4.24">this person is saying this and this</text>
  <text start="211.709" dur="4.261">person saying this this person over here</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="4.5">might not agree with that person and the</text>
  <text start="215.97" dur="4.77">other way around but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="218.19" dur="4.92">that that speech is not free where they</text>
  <text start="220.74" dur="3.75">can say what they want because everyone</text>
  <text start="223.11" dur="3.33">has their own opinions when the founding</text>
  <text start="224.49" dur="3.87">fathers said we have the freedom of</text>
  <text start="226.44" dur="4.409">speech we were allowed to say whatever</text>
  <text start="228.36" dur="6.29">we wanted now you might not agree that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.849" dur="8.571">completely different but who decides</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="9.46">what is hey speech who decides what is</text>
  <text start="239.42" dur="8.64">extremist content because once you start</text>
  <text start="244.11" dur="7.02">to decide that this is hate speech</text>
  <text start="248.06" dur="5.62">because we said so that&amp;#39;s not free</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="5.4">anymore that&amp;#39;s controlled speech because</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="5.01">remember the government and maybe</text>
  <text start="256.53" dur="3.929">YouTube and Google they might think that</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="2.759">as hate speech and this group of people</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="3.451">over here saying I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.449" dur="5.101">hate speech and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="263.91" dur="6.24">this is the problem they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="266.55" dur="6.51">control speech they&amp;#39;re trying to control</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="6.03">it they&amp;#39;re not letting it be open and</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="5.16">free and what McSweeney is saying when</text>
  <text start="276.18" dur="4.53">she appeared in front of the British</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="5.4">politicians is that they can no longer</text>
  <text start="280.71" dur="5.94">control free speech well you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="5.85">supposed to control it that&amp;#39;s the whole</text>
  <text start="286.65" dur="5.94">point because once it&amp;#39;s controlled it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.47" dur="6.15">no longer free and we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="5.639">losing the battle right now and this is</text>
  <text start="295.62" dur="5.699">why we see countries getting ready to</text>
  <text start="298.229" dur="4.771">find people to say listen if if we</text>
  <text start="301.319" dur="3.69">believe this is fake news well guess</text>
  <text start="303" dur="3.629">what we&amp;#39;re gonna find you if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="305.009" dur="3.541">think this is right we&amp;#39;re gonna find you</text>
  <text start="306.629" dur="5.13">if we don&amp;#39;t like that we&amp;#39;re gonna block</text>
  <text start="308.55" dur="6.869">you this is what countries do to fight</text>
  <text start="311.759" dur="6.221">against freedom and once they do this</text>
  <text start="315.419" dur="5.141">you&amp;#39;ve lost your freedom</text>
  <text start="317.98" dur="4.92">we see why now the u.s. is giving China</text>
  <text start="320.56" dur="3.98">a draft proposal for tougher North</text>
  <text start="322.9" dur="5.01">Korean sanctions and once again</text>
  <text start="324.54" dur="5.38">sanctions don&amp;#39;t work anymore other</text>
  <text start="327.91" dur="4.35">countries they completely go around it</text>
  <text start="329.92" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s no need for them it does not</text>
  <text start="332.26" dur="4.35">hurt the countries anymore because all</text>
  <text start="334.87" dur="3.69">they have to do is deal in different</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="4.38">currencies and this is what countries</text>
  <text start="338.56" dur="6.24">have done for a very long time look at</text>
  <text start="340.99" dur="6.15">Cuba look at Syria look at Iran look at</text>
  <text start="344.8" dur="5.37">North Korea they&amp;#39;ve been doing this and</text>
  <text start="347.14" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;ve lasted and they were able to out</text>
  <text start="350.17" dur="6.36">whether the sanctions storm and we see</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="5.1">that this is not going to work now we</text>
  <text start="356.53" dur="4.44">see that South Korea is asking</text>
  <text start="359.32" dur="4.92">Washington to delay the joint military</text>
  <text start="360.97" dur="5.94">exercises until after the 2018 Winter</text>
  <text start="364.24" dur="6">Olympics and right now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="366.91" dur="5.58">Cabal well they have no plans to halt</text>
  <text start="370.24" dur="4.05">the joint drills near the Korean</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="3.45">Peninsula ahead of the Olympics and of</text>
  <text start="374.29" dur="5">course they&amp;#39;re not gonna hold them</text>
  <text start="375.94" dur="6.81">because they want to provoke North Korea</text>
  <text start="379.29" dur="7.63">because the Cabal is still pushing and</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="7.02">trying to get us into a war they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="386.92" dur="6.06">going to give up that easily and we can</text>
  <text start="389.77" dur="5.07">see their plan their goal is going</text>
  <text start="392.98" dur="3.36">forward it looks like they&amp;#39;ve gotten the</text>
  <text start="394.84" dur="3.06">green light and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="3.62">moving ahead with it and we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="397.9" dur="4.65">talking about that in just a minute</text>
  <text start="399.96" dur="5.49">nikki Haley was out there and we talked</text>
  <text start="402.55" dur="5.4">about this also where she presented this</text>
  <text start="405.45" dur="4.33">missile system that they got from Saudi</text>
  <text start="407.95" dur="4.17">Arabia saying this was from Iran the</text>
  <text start="409.78" dur="4.32">Houthis are dealing with Iran Iran is</text>
  <text start="412.12" dur="4.95">supplying the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="414.1" dur="6.54">with you know weapons they are the</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="7.56">sponsors of terror and we need to look a</text>
  <text start="420.64" dur="6.06">little bit closer at this now the rocket</text>
  <text start="424.63" dur="4.95">that they presented had Iranian markings</text>
  <text start="426.7" dur="5.67">it was not launched from Iran or by</text>
  <text start="429.58" dur="5.07">Iranians the Houthi rebels for two years</text>
  <text start="432.37" dur="5.01">victims of a savage war waged by the</text>
  <text start="434.65" dur="5.13">Saudis using US made planes missiles</text>
  <text start="437.38" dur="4.11">bombs and drones very interesting the</text>
  <text start="439.78" dur="4.77">u.s. is supplying all this to Saudi</text>
  <text start="441.49" dur="5.79">Arabia to fight against Yemen and Yemen</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="6.54">never attacked Saudi Arabia so we need</text>
  <text start="447.28" dur="6.39">to look at that we see that</text>
  <text start="451.09" dur="5.31">the Saudi or the Saudi forces attacked</text>
  <text start="453.67" dur="6.09">Yemen and then Yemen decided to defend</text>
  <text start="456.4" dur="6.42">themselves so who&amp;#39;s the sponsor of</text>
  <text start="459.76" dur="5.37">terrorism or the sponsor of war well so</text>
  <text start="462.82" dur="5.61">far it&amp;#39;s the United States because</text>
  <text start="465.13" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;ve been supporting Saudi Arabia and</text>
  <text start="468.43" dur="5.04">Saudi Arabia is also responsible so</text>
  <text start="471.61" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s no evidence as to when the</text>
  <text start="473.47" dur="5.04">Houthis acquired the missile or where</text>
  <text start="475.72" dur="7.29">the question arises what was Hayley&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.51" dur="6.15">motive in going after Iran was this part</text>
  <text start="483.01" dur="3.99">of a new propaganda campaign to drum up</text>
  <text start="484.66" dur="7.47">support for America&amp;#39;s next big Mideast</text>
  <text start="487" dur="8.82">war of course it is and Hayley continued</text>
  <text start="492.13" dur="5.73">on to say it&amp;#39;s hard to find a conflict</text>
  <text start="495.82" dur="4.89">or terrorist group in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="497.86" dur="6.87">that does not have Iran&amp;#39;s fingerprints</text>
  <text start="500.71" dur="6">all over it really I can point some out</text>
  <text start="504.73" dur="3.84">that that don&amp;#39;t have their fingerprints</text>
  <text start="506.71" dur="5.76">all over it let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="508.57" dur="5.37">second Iran is Shiite al-qaeda is Sunni</text>
  <text start="512.47" dur="5.78">why would they be supporting al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="513.94" dur="6.81">they don&amp;#39;t the Islamic state is Sunni</text>
  <text start="518.25" dur="6.69">well guess what Iran&amp;#39;s not gonna support</text>
  <text start="520.75" dur="7.5">them we see Boko Haram is Sunni</text>
  <text start="524.94" dur="7.12">al-shabaab Sunni see a pattern here</text>
  <text start="528.25" dur="7.05">all these terrorist groups are the</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="5.52">opposite of Iran who supports al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="535.3" dur="6.27">the Islamic state Boko Haram al-shabaab</text>
  <text start="537.58" dur="6.06">and the rest ah that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="541.57" dur="5.76">the United States Israel the coalition</text>
  <text start="543.64" dur="6.33">forces so when she says that it&amp;#39;s hard</text>
  <text start="547.33" dur="4.14">to find a conflict or terrorist group in</text>
  <text start="549.97" dur="3.08">the Middle East that does not have</text>
  <text start="551.47" dur="3.75">Erin&amp;#39;s fingerprints all over it</text>
  <text start="553.05" dur="4">completely wrong actually it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="555.22" dur="3.3">find a terrorist group that doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="557.05" dur="4.64">the United States Israel the coalition</text>
  <text start="558.52" dur="7.56">forces fingerprints all over it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="561.69" dur="6.13">where she messed up and also she didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="566.08" dur="4.47">prove that this missile system came from</text>
  <text start="567.82" dur="5.79">a ramp the whole thing was propaganda</text>
  <text start="570.55" dur="5.82">the whole thing was trying to get</text>
  <text start="573.61" dur="5.94">everyone together to go after Iran and</text>
  <text start="576.37" dur="6.24">start a war and we see right now it is</text>
  <text start="579.55" dur="5.19">failing it is not working so what are</text>
  <text start="582.61" dur="5.789">they doing they&amp;#39;re moving to the</text>
  <text start="584.74" dur="6.9">next phase and we see right now they</text>
  <text start="588.399" dur="6.06">tried in Syria to push something in</text>
  <text start="591.64" dur="5.19">there nothing is working actually Assad</text>
  <text start="594.459" dur="4.741">was out there telling Makran listen</text>
  <text start="596.83" dur="5.1">France was spearheading support for</text>
  <text start="599.2" dur="4.259">terrorism in Syria so they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="601.93" dur="3.39">the right to talk about peace or</text>
  <text start="603.459" dur="3.451">anything else same thing with the United</text>
  <text start="605.32" dur="4.41">States because they&amp;#39;re behind all of</text>
  <text start="606.91" dur="7.29">this and he&amp;#39;s right but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="609.73" dur="8.07">seeing right now is that the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="614.2" dur="5.31">becoming so desperate and it looks like</text>
  <text start="617.8" dur="3.45">they got the green light to go ahead</text>
  <text start="619.51" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re making the claim right now that</text>
  <text start="621.25" dur="7.08">the Islamic state has hacked the US Army</text>
  <text start="625.57" dur="7.579">and State Department and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="628.33" dur="8.16">sending assassins to the employees homes</text>
  <text start="633.149" dur="6.13">so right now they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="636.49" dur="4.65">Islamic state has hacked the US Army and</text>
  <text start="639.279" dur="5.101">State Department and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="641.14" dur="5.22">sending assassins to these individual</text>
  <text start="644.38" dur="3.959">homes and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="646.36" dur="4.26">everyone that the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="648.339" dur="5.031">coming the other thing they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="650.62" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re building up the propaganda</text>
  <text start="653.37" dur="5.58">against North Korea now remember they</text>
  <text start="656.29" dur="5.64">talked about the wanna cry malware virus</text>
  <text start="658.95" dur="4.389">where they said that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="661.93" dur="2.58">completely behind this and of course</text>
  <text start="663.339" dur="4.171">when it&amp;#39;s it came out and they have</text>
  <text start="664.51" dur="5.04">really no proof whatsoever because you</text>
  <text start="667.51" dur="4.65">can&amp;#39;t track this stuff that it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="669.55" dur="4.89">difficult and a state actor is not going</text>
  <text start="672.16" dur="4.47">to leave fingerprints but they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="674.44" dur="3.57">the case right now that yes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="676.63" dur="2.37">absolutely North Korea and when you look</text>
  <text start="678.01" dur="2.79">at the evidence it could have been</text>
  <text start="679" dur="3.93">anyone actually when you look at the</text>
  <text start="680.8" dur="5.46">report they named many many different</text>
  <text start="682.93" dur="6">groups North Korea is one of them so</text>
  <text start="686.26" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s no real real proof but if you</text>
  <text start="688.93" dur="3.24">notice the corporate media all of them</text>
  <text start="690.73" dur="3.63">picked it up in the headlines all say</text>
