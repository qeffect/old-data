  <text start="55.95" dur="5.49">exponent report my name is Dave and this</text>
  <text start="57.81" dur="6.24">is episode 1589 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.44" dur="5.88">June 11th 2018 and thus out of the</text>
  <text start="64.05" dur="6.11">episode is IMF the global economic</text>
  <text start="67.32" dur="5.16">outlook is getting darker and darker</text>
  <text start="70.16" dur="4.93">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.48" dur="5.55">financial news now we know that the</text>
  <text start="75.09" dur="6.39">powers the elite the central banking</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="5.25">system they do not want cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="81.48" dur="4.499">they&amp;#39;re trying to push people away from</text>
  <text start="83.28" dur="4.5">cryptocurrency and yes if they can get</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="3.691">full control over cryptocurrency by</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="3.75">creating their own coin and having</text>
  <text start="89.67" dur="4.32">government say this is the coin you need</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="3.99">to use then they&amp;#39;d be all for</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="3.989">cryptocurrency but they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="95.52" dur="4.68">cryptocurrency where it&amp;#39;s outside of</text>
  <text start="97.979" dur="3.991">their control so what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re making it seem very volatile</text>
  <text start="101.97" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re hacking exchanges now you have</text>
  <text start="104.22" dur="6.12">to remember the exchange is not Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="4.32">the exchange is not a theory in the</text>
  <text start="110.34" dur="4.529">exchange is not any of the</text>
  <text start="112.68" dur="4.26">cryptocurrencies this is where you can</text>
  <text start="114.869" dur="4.801">trade cryptocurrency you can store them</text>
  <text start="116.94" dur="4.92">in wallets and it is a centralized</text>
  <text start="119.67" dur="3.84">location just like the banking system I</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="4.5">mean if you look at the banking system</text>
  <text start="123.51" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;ve seen hacks into the banking system</text>
  <text start="126.36" dur="6">because it&amp;#39;s a centralized system this</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="5.28">is why the next generation of the</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="4.379">blockchain system we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="134.58" dur="5.79">decentralized exchanges because we could</text>
  <text start="136.739" dur="5.881">see with centralized exchanges they can</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="4.26">be hacked now are they hacking the</text>
  <text start="142.62" dur="3.96">blockchain no they are not they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="144.63" dur="3.96">hacking the actual exchanges where</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="4.59">everything comes together and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.59" dur="5.64">centralized and this is very important</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="5.19">now over the weekend 42 billion was</text>
  <text start="154.23" dur="4.5">wiped off the cryptocurrency market and</text>
  <text start="156.36" dur="4.65">this is over a small North Korean</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="4.8">exchange hack this is coin Rail</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="4.68">announced that their hack via their</text>
  <text start="163.53" dur="4.53">website calling it system maintenance</text>
  <text start="165.69" dur="4.34">and it&amp;#39;s still down it says system</text>
  <text start="168.06" dur="4.77">system maintenance on there and</text>
  <text start="170.03" dur="4.33">basically the small Korean exchange</text>
  <text start="172.83" dur="3.18">stated that these hackers stole up to</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="5.189">about 30 percent of the digital tokens</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="6.33">in its storage coin rail confirmed that</text>
  <text start="179.549" dur="6.221">the remaining 70% had been safely moved</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="6.57">to a cold wallet and remained unharmed</text>
  <text start="185.77" dur="6.21">and we see right now that this is a</text>
  <text start="188.91" dur="6.76">centralized system right here and this</text>
  <text start="191.98" dur="5.55">is why in the future it will not be like</text>
  <text start="195.67" dur="3.36">this because right now the banking</text>
  <text start="197.53" dur="2.52">system is centralized and think about</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="3.81">all the hacks that have been happening</text>
  <text start="200.05" dur="5.61">at the banking level because everything</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="5.07">is centralized now coin rail it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="205.66" dur="4.89">small exchange that has a daily trading</text>
  <text start="207.91" dur="4.47">volume of around 2.5 million now in</text>
  <text start="210.55" dur="6.27">comparison the top two cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="212.38" dur="7.56">exchanges okay II and Finance have</text>
  <text start="216.82" dur="6.69">roughly about 1.7 billion traded on each</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="7.77">of their exchanges add a coin rail is</text>
  <text start="223.51" dur="7.53">only the 98th largest crypto exchange so</text>
  <text start="227.71" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s really not that big and of course</text>
  <text start="231.04" dur="5.19">the hack is bringing up major red flags</text>
  <text start="233.65" dur="4.5">and people are saying oh my god I better</text>
  <text start="236.23" dur="3.21">get out of cryptocurrency The Wall</text>
  <text start="238.15" dur="3.24">Street Journal&amp;#39;s out there saying</text>
  <text start="239.44" dur="4.44">because of the hack it looks like the</text>
  <text start="241.39" dur="4.8">Bitcoin price fell by 11% well no these</text>
  <text start="243.88" dur="4.68">are all the people they got nervous and</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="4.38">started to panic sell actually this is a</text>
  <text start="248.56" dur="3.51">good time to purchase because all these</text>
  <text start="250.57" dur="3.69">people thought oh my god bitcoins being</text>
  <text start="252.07" dur="2.67">hacked when really Bitcoin is not being</text>
  <text start="254.26" dur="3.599">hacked</text>
  <text start="254.74" dur="5.51">it&amp;#39;s the exchange where everything comes</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="4.171">centralized to one location and</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="3.34">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen in</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="4.26">this like I said before this is going to</text>
  <text start="263.59" dur="4.2">change now if you want to know more</text>
  <text start="266.29" dur="3.12">about crypto currencies you want to</text>
  <text start="267.79" dur="3.93">learn about more you want to learn how</text>
  <text start="269.41" dur="4.77">to trade you can go to the x-22 reports</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="4.53">cool calm and on that website it</text>
  <text start="274.18" dur="5.04">explains what the school is explained it</text>
  <text start="276.25" dur="6.21">explains what the trading room is and</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="6.51">you can learn about it now we understand</text>
  <text start="282.46" dur="6.15">that the economy is breaking down very</text>
  <text start="285.73" dur="7.95">very rapidly and we&amp;#39;re seeing that in</text>
  <text start="288.61" dur="8.64">China the credit impulse gauge is down</text>
  <text start="293.68" dur="5.67">in the negative territory and we talked</text>
  <text start="297.25" dur="4.47">about this before and how and just</text>
  <text start="299.35" dur="4.68">yesterday in our report on how credit is</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="3.99">going to freeze up and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="304.03" dur="4.71">see the same thing happen before because</text>
  <text start="305.71" dur="6.06">if we look back in time we can see every</text>
  <text start="308.74" dur="5.97">single time that credit declines the</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="5.82">credit impulse gauge declines we see a</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="4.49">credit crisis now we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="4.31">2008 and</text>
  <text start="319.2" dur="4.95">seeing it today as the credit impulse</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="4.38">continually declines and basically</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="4.08">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.28" dur="3.9">everything&amp;#39;s gonna start to slow up</text>
  <text start="328.23" dur="3.98">everything&amp;#39;s gonna come to a screeching</text>
  <text start="330.18" dur="5.37">halt everything&amp;#39;s going to freeze and</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="5.17">the entire system is going to be in</text>
  <text start="335.55" dur="4.38">trouble now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="337.38" dur="4.05">Bernanke is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="339.93" dur="3.42">that yeah we&amp;#39;re gonna see an economic</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="3.6">collapse in 2020 and of course this is</text>
  <text start="343.35" dur="3.39">the individual that couldn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="345.03" dur="3.9">forecast a recession in the same year</text>
  <text start="346.74" dur="3.84">where he said I don&amp;#39;t see a recession</text>
  <text start="348.93" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;re not forecasting recession there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="5.07">nothing wrong everything&amp;#39;s contained and</text>
  <text start="352.2" dur="5.67">we had the recession later in 2008 when</text>
  <text start="355.65" dur="5.37">he told us in 2008 we weren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="357.87" dur="4.64">see a recession so if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="361.02" dur="5.13">a little bit</text>
  <text start="362.51" dur="6.78">Bernanke saw no risk to the economy when</text>
  <text start="366.15" dur="7.07">there was 13 trillion dollars in deficit</text>
  <text start="369.29" dur="6.96">four point seven trillion fed QE bubble</text>
  <text start="373.22" dur="6.22">1.5 trillion increase in taxes</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="4.87">stagnating real wages productivity</text>
  <text start="379.44" dur="5.51">growth and labor participation rate at</text>
  <text start="381.12" dur="7.76">17 1978 levels but he&amp;#39;s worried about</text>
  <text start="384.95" dur="7.33">that tax cuts right now everything else</text>
  <text start="388.88" dur="7.12">he didn&amp;#39;t see a problem the biggest</text>
  <text start="392.28" dur="5.31">worry is these tax cuts and he says with</text>
  <text start="396" dur="3.45">this and with the tariffs the whole</text>
  <text start="397.59" dur="4.92">thing is just going to implode what</text>
  <text start="399.45" dur="6.6">these central bankers are really saying</text>
  <text start="402.51" dur="6.54">is that their system is not going to</text>
  <text start="406.05" dur="5.91">survive remember the system were in is</text>
  <text start="409.05" dur="5.97">not a people system it is a system that</text>
  <text start="411.96" dur="4.5">the central bankers created and when</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="3.6">they say the whole thing&amp;#39;s gonna fall</text>
  <text start="416.46" dur="5.07">apart they&amp;#39;re talking about themselves</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re talking about what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="421.53" dur="5.52">happen when their system completely</text>
  <text start="423.69" dur="5.58">implodes and a new system is born and</text>
  <text start="427.05" dur="4.23">they don&amp;#39;t want their system to implode</text>
  <text start="429.27" dur="4.68">I mean look at Argentina right now they</text>
  <text start="431.28" dur="5.37">just had a record bailout from the IMF</text>
  <text start="433.95" dur="5.88">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="436.65" dur="6.06">again because you cannot fix the problem</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="5.88">with more debt and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="5.49">what the IMF does this time because what</text>
  <text start="445.71" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the peso is</text>
  <text start="448.2" dur="4.62">collapsing again and the entire system</text>
  <text start="452.07" dur="3.69">is in</text>
  <text start="452.82" dur="5.82">freefall which means either they have to</text>
  <text start="455.76" dur="4.32">come up with more funding and show that</text>
  <text start="458.64" dur="3.68">everything is great but again you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.08" dur="5.01">just feeding in more debt into Argentina</text>
  <text start="462.32" dur="4.39">pushing austerity on the people and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="465.09" dur="5.04">a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="466.71" dur="6.51">and again they the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="470.13" dur="5.67">cannot let a country implode because</text>
  <text start="473.22" dur="4.95">everyone would point the finger at the</text>
  <text start="475.8" dur="4.89">central banks and say why did you make</text>
  <text start="478.17" dur="5.04">this country collapse with so much debt</text>
  <text start="480.69" dur="4.38">so they&amp;#39;re very careful on what they do</text>
  <text start="483.21" dur="4.32">and this is why they need to make sure</text>
  <text start="485.07" dur="4.98">every time they give more and more debt</text>
  <text start="487.53" dur="3.99">this is why they need to have the</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="3.54">government&amp;#39;s and they&amp;#39;re forcing the</text>
  <text start="491.52" dur="5.1">government&amp;#39;s to push austerity on the</text>
  <text start="493.59" dur="6.33">people to cut programs to pay for their</text>
  <text start="496.62" dur="6.51">debt it&amp;#39;s a never-ending cycle which</text>
  <text start="499.92" dur="6.15">will continue on and they try to keep</text>
  <text start="503.13" dur="6.66">the countries in limbo we see right now</text>
  <text start="506.07" dur="7.529">that Merkel and the EU they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="509.79" dur="6.42">to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US</text>
  <text start="513.599" dur="5.011">and we see that things did not go well</text>
  <text start="516.21" dur="3.99">in the g7 and it looks like the EU</text>
  <text start="518.61" dur="5.46">members voiced their support for a plan</text>
  <text start="520.2" dur="6.57">that would slap 25% tariffs on up to 3.3</text>
  <text start="524.07" dur="4.8">billion in US goods and eventually this</text>
  <text start="526.77" dur="4.77">is going to come back and hurt Europe</text>
  <text start="528.87" dur="5.49">and we see right now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="531.54" dur="5.13">figure out a way around everything</text>
  <text start="534.36" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s going on and the biggest problem</text>
  <text start="536.67" dur="5.34">now is that we have the deep state the</text>
  <text start="538.95" dur="5.37">central bankers on one side the u.s. the</text>
  <text start="542.01" dur="5.49">Patriots on the other side and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.32" dur="5.79">happening is the old central banking</text>
  <text start="547.5" dur="5.37">system the way they had it is being</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="4.31">pushed out and they don&amp;#39;t like it they</text>
  <text start="552.87" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t know what to do and this is why</text>
  <text start="554.42" dur="5.11">Christine Lagarde is out there and she</text>
  <text start="556.92" dur="5.19">is the head of the International</text>
  <text start="559.53" dur="6.48">Monetary Fund and she&amp;#39;s pointing out</text>
  <text start="562.11" dur="6.69">that there&amp;#39;s a problem with the global</text>
  <text start="566.01" dur="5.76">economic outlook and it&amp;#39;s darkening</text>
  <text start="568.8" dur="6.27">day by day she&amp;#39;s saying that trumps</text>
  <text start="571.77" dur="6.09">America first trade policy well it looks</text>
  <text start="575.07" dur="6.48">like it&amp;#39;s having a terrible effect on</text>
  <text start="577.86" dur="5.79">the global economy and the clouds are</text>
  <text start="581.55" dur="5.029">rolling in it&amp;#39;s getting darker and</text>
  <text start="583.65" dur="5.479">darker and it&amp;#39;s not going to work</text>
  <text start="586.579" dur="6.51">for the global economy if we continue on</text>
  <text start="589.129" dur="6.541">in this way and Lagarde unleashed a</text>
  <text start="593.089" dur="5.25">thinly veiled attack on Trump&amp;#39;s trade</text>
  <text start="595.67" dur="5.159">policy saying that challenges to the way</text>
  <text start="598.339" dur="5.131">trade is conducted were damaging</text>
  <text start="600.829" dur="6.57">business confidence which had soured</text>
  <text start="603.47" dur="6.299">even since the weekend g7 summit the</text>
  <text start="607.399" dur="5.37">washington-based IMF is sticking to its</text>
  <text start="609.769" dur="5.61">forecasts for a global growth of 3.9</text>
  <text start="612.769" dur="5.1">percent and you know the IMF is always</text>
  <text start="615.379" dur="4.14">off in their forecasts the hill ways say</text>
  <text start="617.869" dur="3.481">oh it&amp;#39;s gonna be around 4% and they say</text>
  <text start="619.519" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s gonna be around 3.5% then they come</text>
  <text start="621.35" dur="3.329">down to 2% and they keep doing this over</text>
  <text start="623.449" dur="2.99">and over and over and if you look back</text>
  <text start="624.679" dur="4.291">in time this is what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="626.439" dur="4.99">continuously there they&amp;#39;re never right</text>
  <text start="628.97" dur="5.19">on what the global outlook is going to</text>
  <text start="631.429" dur="6.45">be and she went on to say that the</text>
  <text start="634.16" dur="7.289">clouds are on the horizon and we are now</text>
  <text start="637.879" dur="7.62">seeing signs that things are getting</text>
  <text start="641.449" dur="6">darker by the day and the biggest and</text>
  <text start="645.499" dur="4.53">darkest cloud that we see is the</text>
  <text start="647.449" dur="5.07">deterioration in confidence that is</text>
  <text start="650.029" dur="4.8">prompted by an attempt to challenge the</text>
  <text start="652.519" dur="4.98">way in which trade has been conducted in</text>
  <text start="654.829" dur="4.59">which relationships have been handled</text>
  <text start="657.499" dur="3.95">and in which multi multilateral</text>
  <text start="659.419" dur="4.621">organizations have been operating</text>
  <text start="661.449" dur="5.23">basically what she&amp;#39;s saying is you are</text>

  <text start="666.679" dur="8.87">system has run over many many years and</text>
  <text start="670.839" dur="9.73">we don&amp;#39;t like this because now you are</text>
  <text start="675.549" dur="7.931">going after our system and this is the</text>
  <text start="680.569" dur="5.85">problem because what is involved the</text>
  <text start="683.48" dur="4.979">World Trade Organization because Trump</text>
  <text start="686.419" dur="4.53">is not abiding by the World Trade</text>
  <text start="688.459" dur="4.831">Organization he is now he&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="690.949" dur="4.47">this globally he&amp;#39;s doing it on bilateral</text>
  <text start="693.29" dur="4.829">trade where he&amp;#39;s dealing with one</text>
  <text start="695.419" dur="5.941">country here this country here just like</text>
  <text start="698.119" dur="6.361">China is doing and the central banking</text>
  <text start="701.36" dur="6.059">system does not like this whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="704.48" dur="6.479">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that this is not</text>
  <text start="707.419" dur="5.07">good for them remember this always comes</text>
  <text start="710.959" dur="4.41">back to them because this is their</text>
  <text start="712.489" dur="6.81">system this is their global economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="715.369" dur="5.171">set up to profit these individuals in</text>
  <text start="719.299" dur="6.701">the Bank of International</text>
  <text start="720.54" dur="7.92">sentiment the IMF the Fed the ECB and</text>
  <text start="726" dur="5.34">the rest it&amp;#39;s not to benefit the people</text>
  <text start="728.46" dur="5.37">and what&amp;#39;s happening right now is their</text>
  <text start="731.34" dur="5.58">friction because there&amp;#39;s a pushback</text>
  <text start="733.83" dur="4.38">where past leaders would just go along</text>
  <text start="736.92" dur="4.44">with the central bank&amp;#39;s that get paid</text>
  <text start="738.21" dur="4.65">off they get perks and now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="741.36" dur="3.66">happening is the Patriots and Trump</text>
  <text start="742.86" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re pushing against the central</text>
  <text start="745.02" dur="4.98">banking system and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="747.84" dur="5.79">don&amp;#39;t like this and this is why I do</text>
  <text start="750" dur="7.05">believe in the end there will be a push</text>
  <text start="753.63" dur="6">to remove the central banking system not</text>
  <text start="757.05" dur="5.88">just the u.s. but I believe Russia China</text>
  <text start="759.63" dur="6.27">this is their main push in the end</text>
  <text start="762.93" dur="4.83">because we know that Russia has taken</text>
  <text start="765.9" dur="4.55">over the Rothschild central banking</text>
  <text start="767.76" dur="5.94">system China right now is working with</text>
  <text start="770.45" dur="6.1">Trump and the Patriots and I think their</text>
  <text start="773.7" dur="4.77">move their eventual move is to remove</text>
  <text start="776.55" dur="3.54">the central banking system and again I</text>
  <text start="778.47" dur="4.19">go back to enter Jackson hanging in</text>
  <text start="780.09" dur="5.43">Trump&amp;#39;s office where Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="782.66" dur="5.71">basically got rid of the central banking</text>
  <text start="785.52" dur="5.16">system and I think this is where this is</text>
  <text start="788.37" dur="5.7">headed and again it all comes down to</text>
  <text start="790.68" dur="5.64">who controls the narrative and right now</text>
  <text start="794.07" dur="5.28">what Trump is doing and the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="796.32" dur="6.08">doing they&amp;#39;re pushing this system which</text>
  <text start="799.35" dur="5.82">is a central banking system to the edge</text>
  <text start="802.4" dur="6.49">reworking it remember we&amp;#39;ve been in this</text>
  <text start="805.17" dur="6.42">system since 1913 and it went completely</text>
  <text start="808.89" dur="4.74">haywire in the 70s when we came off the</text>
  <text start="811.59" dur="4.89">gold standard and it was a complete</text>
  <text start="813.63" dur="4.68">central banking system at that point and</text>
  <text start="816.48" dur="4.16">it just got worse and worse as time went</text>
  <text start="818.31" dur="4.97">on and we are at the endgame right now</text>
  <text start="820.64" dur="5.28">this is what the end game looks like</text>
  <text start="823.28" dur="4.96">when the central banking system is</text>
  <text start="825.92" dur="4.72">completely failing they&amp;#39;re just creating</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="4.29">currency they&amp;#39;re shoving it into banks</text>
  <text start="830.64" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re propping up the stock market</text>
  <text start="832.53" dur="4.86">they manipulate all the numbers and they</text>
  <text start="835.17" dur="4.62">keep doing this because they need a way</text>
  <text start="837.39" dur="4.89">out and believe me they&amp;#39;re unwinding of</text>
  <text start="839.79" dur="5.34">a couple of billion that&amp;#39;s not their way</text>
  <text start="842.28" dur="4.8">out upping the interest rates lowering</text>
  <text start="845.13" dur="4.8">the interest interest rates that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="847.08" dur="6.84">their way out their way out was to have</text>
  <text start="849.93" dur="7.77">an event to cover up everything they did</text>
  <text start="853.92" dur="6.99">and to explain away why everyone has to</text>
  <text start="857.7" dur="6.689">sacrifice and why everyone has to</text>
  <text start="860.91" dur="6.359">basically accept the austerity as we</text>
  <text start="864.389" dur="5.521">move into this event which most likely</text>
  <text start="867.269" dur="5.041">would be a war the problem now is they</text>
  <text start="869.91" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t have that and they&amp;#39;re struggling</text>
  <text start="872.31" dur="3.839">they don&amp;#39;t know what to do at this point</text>
  <text start="874.62" dur="4.56">because that&amp;#39;s what they normally have</text>
  <text start="876.149" dur="6.481">and every time they try to push that</text>
  <text start="879.18" dur="4.469">agenda it&amp;#39;s being stamped out and they</text>
  <text start="882.63" dur="3.06">thought they were going to have a</text>
  <text start="883.649" dur="3.511">different player in office they thought</text>
  <text start="885.69" dur="3.81">they were gonna be going down this route</text>
  <text start="887.16" dur="4.859">where they would have this event and</text>
  <text start="889.5" dur="4.949">they could blame this on this other</text>
  <text start="892.019" dur="4.62">nation and blame it on the war blame it</text>
  <text start="894.449" dur="3.661">on everything and this way once</text>
  <text start="896.639" dur="2.88">everything&amp;#39;s all said and done they</text>
  <text start="898.11" dur="3.15">reekin think when we start the system</text>
  <text start="899.519" dur="4.26">because no one will remember what</text>
  <text start="901.26" dur="5.129">happened with the the economy everyone</text>
  <text start="903.779" dur="4.231">forget after the war they would have no</text>
  <text start="906.389" dur="3.211">knowledge of it whatsoever they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="908.01" dur="3.689">care they would just be happy that the</text>
  <text start="909.6" dur="3.39">war has ended and again the central</text>
  <text start="911.699" dur="3.211">banks would make out because all the</text>
  <text start="912.99" dur="4.74">countries would need to borrow to</text>
  <text start="914.91" dur="4.41">rebuild and they would get their hands</text>
  <text start="917.73" dur="3.45">back into every single one of the</text>
  <text start="919.32" dur="4.73">countries and all the countries would be</text>
  <text start="921.18" dur="6.269">in debt to the central bank right now</text>
  <text start="924.05" dur="7.57">there&amp;#39;s a problem there&amp;#39;s no war and</text>
  <text start="927.449" dur="7.191">they want one they need an event so what</text>
  <text start="931.62" dur="5.94">do they do how do they get around this</text>
  <text start="934.64" dur="7.83">this is their problem because their</text>
  <text start="937.56" dur="7.86">entire global central bank economy is</text>
  <text start="942.47" dur="4.6">falling apart the debt can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="945.42" dur="4.5">sustained and you&amp;#39;re seeing one country</text>
  <text start="947.07" dur="5.55">after another implode yes they can pile</text>
  <text start="949.92" dur="5.849">on more debt but it will only last for a</text>
  <text start="952.62" dur="4.649">while until it implodes again and in</text>
  <text start="955.769" dur="3.331">another country is going to go and in</text>
  <text start="957.269" dur="4.291">another banking system is gonna go and</text>
