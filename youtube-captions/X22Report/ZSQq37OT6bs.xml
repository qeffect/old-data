  <text start="68.619" dur="5.941">little while back the friends president</text>
  <text start="71.369" dur="6.491">the french President stated that you</text>
  <text start="74.56" dur="6.809">know everything looks good and back in</text>
  <text start="77.86" dur="5.25">April we had a report that the the</text>
  <text start="81.369" dur="5.57">French economy was doing much much</text>
  <text start="83.11" dur="8.16">better then in July Fitch downgraded</text>

  <text start="99.21" dur="7.68">French finance minister has to cut its</text>
  <text start="102.85" dur="9.089">economic growth forecasts for 2013 and</text>
  <text start="106.89" dur="7.78">the IMF is looking at France and they</text>
  <text start="111.939" dur="5.371">are saying if things continue Li the way</text>

  <text start="117.31" dur="9.419">2013 France most likely will be in a</text>
  <text start="121.78" dur="7.38">recession so again I reported I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="126.729" dur="4.291">remember how many episodes back when the</text>
  <text start="129.16" dur="3.93">president of France said that everything</text>
  <text start="131.02" dur="5.33">looks okay and everything seems to be</text>
  <text start="133.09" dur="5.87">fine it&amp;#39;s always the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="136.35" dur="4.95">any government official says I mean we</text>
  <text start="138.96" dur="4.92">just have to look back in history and</text>
  <text start="141.3" dur="5.73">look at what really happened and the</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="4.53">actions not what the officials say</text>
  <text start="147.03" dur="6.6">because if we really listen to the</text>
  <text start="148.41" dur="6.75">officials it&amp;#39;s it never turns out the</text>
  <text start="153.63" dur="3.93">way they say I mean if let&amp;#39;s just go</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="7.32">back to two thousand eight Ben Bernanke</text>
  <text start="157.56" dur="7.86">in 2008 and the year of OA to said the</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="8.01">Fed you know the ones that create all</text>
  <text start="165.42" dur="9.18">the money that are controlling every</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="6.84">aspect of the economic growth and the</text>
  <text start="174.6" dur="5.46">economy not hearing just in the United</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="4.2">States but pretty much worldwide that</text>
  <text start="180.06" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re giving money to all different</text>
  <text start="181.53" dur="4.89">banks and things like that you know he</text>
  <text start="184.08" dur="4.41">says he doesn&amp;#39;t understand gold you know</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="4.5">this is the person that that&amp;#39;s I mean</text>
  <text start="188.49" dur="5.01">he&amp;#39;s not really in office because the</text>
  <text start="190.92" dur="4.86">Fed is a corporation but this is from</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="4.92">everyone else&amp;#39;s a fan point this is the</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="8.28">person calling the shots and in back in</text>
  <text start="198.42" dur="9.09">08 he said that the Fed is from all</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="6.75">indicators is not forecasting a</text>
  <text start="207.51" dur="5.93">recession and what happened was we had a</text>
  <text start="210.81" dur="5.31">recession he also said that the subprime</text>
  <text start="213.44" dur="5.74">mortgage-backed securities was contained</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="5.82">it wasn&amp;#39;t the president came out and</text>
  <text start="219.18" dur="6.62">said the AI AIG would only need one</text>
  <text start="221.94" dur="7.89">bailout but they needed you know 23</text>
  <text start="225.8" dur="7.3">bailouts besides that the IMF eurozone</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="5.64">came out and said Greece would only need</text>
  <text start="233.1" dur="5.1">one bailout and everything would look</text>
  <text start="235.47" dur="4.77">and everything will be perfect but guess</text>
  <text start="238.2" dur="5.73">what happened they needed more than one</text>
  <text start="240.24" dur="5.73">bailout and now they&amp;#39;re really worse off</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="4.77">than they were when they got the first</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="4.86">bailout and then we go to Cyprus where</text>
  <text start="248.7" dur="4.53">they said oh don&amp;#39;t worry we&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="250.83" dur="5.04">going to take you know from the ballons</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="4.62">four to ten percent or something in that</text>
  <text start="255.87" dur="5.19">range don&amp;#39;t worry and they ended up</text>
  <text start="257.85" dur="6.48">taking what 47.5 percent and don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="261.06" dur="5.34">the capital controls will only you know</text>
  <text start="264.33" dur="5.58">be in effect for two weeks maybe three</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="5.91">at the most it&amp;#39;s been over a hundred</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="6.12">20 days already and the capital controls</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="5.4">are still in effect so I mean if we can</text>
  <text start="276.03" dur="3.33">even go back even further if you want to</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="4.01">go back to the Great Depression with the</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="5.61">president back then in nineteen thirty</text>
  <text start="281.72" dur="6.01">he said that the the worst is behind us</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="6.03">everything looks good the economy is</text>
  <text start="287.73" dur="7.05">really taking off and growing in 1932</text>
  <text start="291" dur="6.3">was the huge huge stock market crash and</text>
  <text start="294.78" dur="4.68">the economy went back into a recession</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="4.8">depression and everything started</text>
  <text start="299.46" dur="4.44">falling apart again so you know we can</text>
  <text start="302.1" dur="3.72">listen to the government officials but I</text>
  <text start="303.9" dur="3.69">like to look at the actions of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.82" dur="4.53">really going on because what&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="5.88">out of their mouths are just words that</text>
  <text start="310.35" dur="6.81">they want to tell you and everything</text>
  <text start="313.47" dur="6.6">else that&amp;#39;s going on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="317.16" dur="5.22">is what they don&amp;#39;t want you to see so</text>
  <text start="320.07" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s better to look at their actions and</text>
  <text start="322.38" dur="4.86">the history of what they tell you than</text>
  <text start="324.87" dur="4.11">what they&amp;#39;re what I mean the history of</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="6.93">what they&amp;#39;ve done instead of what</text>
  <text start="328.98" dur="7.98">they&amp;#39;re telling people okay now the</text>
  <text start="334.17" dur="8.07">European banks are cutting around 5,500</text>
  <text start="336.96" dur="7.14">branches across Europe and this go this</text>

  <text start="349.169" dur="8.25">leaving fewer outlets than it had before</text>
  <text start="351.96" dur="7.95">the financial crisis in 2008 and it also</text>
  <text start="357.419" dur="3.931">says that the banks across the EU cut</text>
  <text start="359.91" dur="5.04">two point five percent of their total</text>

  <text start="367.62" dur="7.2">fewer offices than it had before the</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="7.65">start of the financial crisis and we see</text>
  <text start="374.82" dur="5.31">the EU doing this and here a couple</text>
  <text start="377.73" dur="5.25">reports ago I reported on bank of</text>
  <text start="380.13" dur="6.24">america also closing branches and</text>
  <text start="382.98" dur="6.09">raising capital and they were closing</text>

  <text start="398.19" dur="6.37">eastern Washington Idaho or Oregon and</text>
  <text start="402.37" dur="4.74">Mexico and selling those to Washington</text>
  <text start="404.56" dur="7.28">federal and they are trying to raise</text>
  <text start="407.11" dur="8.99">money and because it seems like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="411.84" dur="7.27">selling off closing consolidating</text>
  <text start="416.1" dur="5.46">because they know something is coming</text>
  <text start="419.11" dur="9.71">something is coming and they are raising</text>
  <text start="421.56" dur="10.15">cash right now ok now I understand that</text>
  <text start="428.82" dur="4.659">the government you know put out the</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="3.89">unemployment numbers they tell you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.479" dur="4.531">seven point four percent and</text>
  <text start="435.6" dur="4.629">unemployment is getting much better and</text>
  <text start="438.01" dur="7.5">they&amp;#39;re making it seem like the economy</text>
  <text start="440.229" dur="6.991">is on the cusp of turning around and it</text>
  <text start="445.51" dur="4.159">looks like it&amp;#39;s building up steam</text>
  <text start="447.22" dur="5.009">they&amp;#39;re going to change the GDP</text>
  <text start="449.669" dur="4.12">calculation and they&amp;#39;re going to include</text>
  <text start="452.229" dur="3.81">things like research and development go</text>
  <text start="453.789" dur="5.19">all the way back to the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="456.039" dur="6.241">and recalculate GDP so it will no longer</text>
  <text start="458.979" dur="6.541">be negative gdp will be like positive</text>
  <text start="462.28" dur="5.91">three percent gdp and they manipulated</text>
  <text start="465.52" dur="5.369">the unemployment numbers so it looks</text>
  <text start="468.19" dur="5.159">like the unemployment is going down but</text>
  <text start="470.889" dur="6.03">instead those people who stop looking or</text>
  <text start="473.349" dur="7.741">falling off and they don&amp;#39;t count those</text>
  <text start="476.919" dur="7.111">people anymore but this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="481.09" dur="7.68">that teams right now face the worst</text>
  <text start="484.03" dur="9.9">labor market and there are kids that are</text>
  <text start="488.77" dur="7.709">from 16 to 19 years old it&amp;#39;s around 23.7</text>
  <text start="493.93" dur="4.37">if we use the older calculation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.479" dur="3.901">probably closer to fifty percent</text>
  <text start="498.3" dur="6.31">especially those people coming out of</text>
  <text start="500.38" dur="6">college looking for work it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="504.61" dur="5.04">high because if we look at the</text>
  <text start="506.38" dur="4.86">unemployment calculations prior to</text>
  <text start="509.65" dur="4.35">nineteen ninety four when they change</text>
  <text start="511.24" dur="5.37">them we&amp;#39;re looking at unemployment right</text>
  <text start="514" dur="6.33">now a 23-percent and if we look at your</text>
  <text start="516.61" dur="6.15">the European unemployment overall it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.33" dur="5.46">around twelve percent Spain is around</text>
  <text start="522.76" dur="6.57">twenty-five percent Frances in the 20s</text>
  <text start="525.79" dur="5.94">Greece is almost in the 30s getting very</text>
  <text start="529.33" dur="4.89">close I mean among youth it&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="531.73" dur="4.44">higher it&amp;#39;s like a sixty percent same in</text>
  <text start="534.22" dur="5.58">Cyprus so with</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="8.4">very very high unemployment you have a</text>
  <text start="539.8" dur="9.45">lot of people who don&amp;#39;t have work of</text>
  <text start="544.57" dur="7.86">course who can&amp;#39;t pay taxes to the</text>
  <text start="549.25" dur="5.339">government which would help with the</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="5.159">debt that the government has to pay the</text>
  <text start="554.589" dur="5.49">interest on this debt and to create</text>
  <text start="557.589" dur="5.461">revenue and we&amp;#39;re seeing this all across</text>
  <text start="560.079" dur="6.181">even in America there&amp;#39;s not enough</text>
  <text start="563.05" dur="5.099">revenue in the tax base to pay for the</text>
  <text start="566.26" dur="3.509">interest on the debt and that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="568.149" dur="4.55">government is continually borrowing and</text>
  <text start="569.769" dur="5.88">that&amp;#39;s why the spending is you know</text>
  <text start="572.699" dur="5.051">escalating and rising so quickly because</text>
  <text start="575.649" dur="4.861">there&amp;#39;s just not enough and we saw that</text>
  <text start="577.75" dur="4.709">play out in Greece and Cyprus took a</text>
  <text start="580.51" dur="4.8">different path of doing a bail-in and a</text>
  <text start="582.459" dur="7.74">little bit of a bailout also they did</text>
  <text start="585.31" dur="8.1">both and again debt upon debt upon debt</text>
  <text start="590.199" dur="7.621">with no revenue or new revenue coming in</text>
  <text start="593.41" dur="6.72">it&amp;#39;s a failed model which cannot sustain</text>
  <text start="597.82" dur="4.23">itself and eventually you end up with a</text>
  <text start="600.13" dur="4.53">collapse and there&amp;#39;s no other place to</text>
  <text start="602.05" dur="5.43">go and there&amp;#39;s nothing else you can do</text>
  <text start="604.66" dur="5.609">yeah the US government they&amp;#39;re printing</text>
  <text start="607.48" dur="4.62">money but what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="610.269" dur="3.391">putting it all into the equity market</text>
  <text start="612.1" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re not letting it out to small</text>
  <text start="613.66" dur="5.789">businesses they&amp;#39;re not putting it out to</text>
  <text start="615.91" dur="6.09">other businesses to expand so they can</text>
  <text start="619.449" dur="4.291">hire more people they&amp;#39;re just putting it</text>
  <text start="622" dur="4.5">all into the equity market making it</text>
  <text start="623.74" dur="5.459">seem like everything is getting better</text>
  <text start="626.5" dur="4.68">and they want everyone looking at the</text>
  <text start="629.199" dur="3.811">stock market and what&amp;#39;s funny is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="631.18" dur="4.17">done this in the past they&amp;#39;ve done this</text>
  <text start="633.01" dur="4.079">in the Great Depression the stock market</text>
  <text start="635.35" dur="6.359">I mean back then the highs were like you</text>
  <text start="637.089" dur="7.401">know 300 400 but they in the roaring 20s</text>
  <text start="641.709" dur="7.801">the stock market hit all-time new highs</text>
  <text start="644.49" dur="6.279">but the economy was doing terribly but</text>
  <text start="649.51" dur="3.3">they had all lies in the stock market</text>
  <text start="650.769" dur="4.62">and people kept on putting money into</text>
  <text start="652.81" dur="6.329">the stock market and you know and then</text>
  <text start="655.389" dur="6.871">all of a sudden the market crashed same</text>
  <text start="659.139" dur="6.721">thing happened during the period of</text>
  <text start="662.26" dur="5.819">the.com in 2008 hitting all-time highs</text>
  <text start="665.86" dur="3.48">again everyone putting money into the</text>
  <text start="668.079" dur="4.891">market</text>
  <text start="669.34" dur="7.74">and the economy was lagging behind and</text>
  <text start="672.97" dur="8.61">it was pletely disconnected and prior to</text>
  <text start="677.08" dur="7.47">the 2008-2009 crash the economy in the</text>
  <text start="681.58" dur="5.22">housing market unemployment was starting</text>
  <text start="684.55" dur="3.93">to go up and all these indicators but no</text>
  <text start="686.8" dur="3.81">one ever mentioned any of that because</text>
  <text start="688.48" dur="3.63">all eyes are on the market the same</text>
  <text start="690.61" dur="3.03">thing that&amp;#39;s happening again it seems</text>
  <text start="692.11" dur="4.53">like it&amp;#39;s the same pattern over and over</text>
  <text start="693.64" dur="4.8">and over but everyone pretends that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="696.64" dur="4.65">not happening oh look the housing</text>

  <text start="707.38" dur="7.77">seeing this play out again and it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="710.47" dur="9.03">same pattern over and over and over okay</text>
  <text start="715.15" dur="7.64">now Senator McCain and Graham they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="2279.26" dur="7.71">these drones can be fitted with weapons</text>
  <text start="2282.86" dur="7.77">very easily so we can see what they are</text>
  <text start="2286.97" dur="7.2">doing and what they are preparing now I</text>
  <text start="2290.63" dur="5.7">said this in the past that for them to</text>
  <text start="2294.17" dur="4.44">maintain control of course the central</text>

  <text start="2356.45" dur="5.19">take over all communications which</text>
  <text start="2359.24" dur="4.14">includes the Internet in a state of</text>
  <text start="2361.64" dur="8.25">emergency what that state of emergency</text>
  <text start="2363.38" dur="8.76">is it&amp;#39;s up to him he calls it so to take</text>
  <text start="2369.89" dur="4.35">it a step further these central bankers</text>
  <text start="2372.14" dur="6.75">in the US government what they want to</text>
  <text start="2374.24" dur="8.4">do is control the internet now this way</text>
  <text start="2378.89" dur="6">if they have control their propaganda</text>
  <text start="2382.64" dur="3.84">their mainstream media can continually</text>
  <text start="2384.89" dur="3.33">tell everyone what they want them to</text>
  <text start="2386.48" dur="3.27">tell them there&amp;#39;s alternative media</text>
  <text start="2388.22" dur="4.71">which everyone knows about or you</text>
  <text start="2389.75" dur="4.83">wouldn&amp;#39;t be listening you know which is</text>
  <text start="2392.93" dur="4.32">all over the internet showing a</text>
  <text start="2394.58" dur="5.67">different side of every story and they</text>
  <text start="2397.25" dur="7.35">do not like this this is not good for</text>
  <text start="2400.25" dur="5.28">them so how what can they do well they</text>
  <text start="2404.6" dur="2.79">have sis</text>
  <text start="2405.53" dur="3.3">they have the executive orders they have</text>
  <text start="2407.39" dur="4.56">the emergency to take over all</text>
  <text start="2408.83" dur="6.51">communications the Pentagon has already</text>
  <text start="2411.95" dur="7.95">set set up a secondary internet which is</text>
  <text start="2415.34" dur="7.59">a wireless 4g system which is only used</text>
  <text start="2419.9" dur="5.34">by the government officials if the</text>
  <text start="2422.93" dur="5.73">internet goes down and I reported this</text>
  <text start="2425.24" dur="6.39">on a couple of episodes ago and they</text>
  <text start="2428.66" dur="5.85">have access to that and we the people do</text>
  <text start="2431.63" dur="6.65">not so if the internet went down don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2434.51" dur="6.81">worry you have no internet but they do</text>
  <text start="2438.28" dur="5.68">so how else can they control the</text>
  <text start="2441.32" dur="5.73">internet and make sure everyone is doing</text>
  <text start="2443.96" dur="6.06">what they want and owned also by the way</text>
  <text start="2447.05" dur="5.1">there is an internet law that a couple</text>
  <text start="2450.02" dur="4.43">episodes back I forgot which one of HR</text>
  <text start="2452.15" dur="6">something or other where you know</text>
  <text start="2454.45" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it that if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2458.15" dur="5.19">looking at different sites during work</text>
  <text start="2460.19" dur="5.76">it could become it could be a crime and</text>
  <text start="2463.34" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re trying to move this law even</text>
  <text start="2465.95" dur="6.93">further so they can stop people from</text>
  <text start="2469.82" dur="7.02">looking at different sites but to take</text>
  <text start="2472.88" dur="8.19">this a step further their grand plan is</text>
  <text start="2476.84" dur="7.23">for a global ID and what this means is</text>
  <text start="2481.07" dur="6.69">every time you sign on to the internet</text>
  <text start="2484.07" dur="6.39">it will create a profile of you you will</text>
  <text start="2487.76" dur="4.5">no longer be able to use and with this</text>
  <text start="2490.46" dur="3.39">law that i just mentioned HR something i</text>
  <text start="2492.26" dur="5.91">forgot the actual number but i have it</text>
  <text start="2493.85" dur="9.44">on one of my reports you will no longer</text>
  <text start="2498.17" dur="8.22">be able to use a code name instead</text>
  <text start="2503.29" dur="5.98">because it will be illegal you will have</text>
  <text start="2506.39" dur="6.39">to use your real name it will create a</text>
  <text start="2509.27" dur="6.48">profile of you on the internet it will</text>
  <text start="2512.78" dur="6.18">be the global ID and it will be used for</text>
  <text start="2515.75" dur="6.42">everything this way they can keep track</text>
  <text start="2518.96" dur="7.83">of where you go and what you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2522.17" dur="7.56">and this you know this goes on to sell</text>
  <text start="2526.79" dur="5.28">just read some of it the grand plan for</text>
  <text start="2529.73" dur="5.31">a global ID is to give each person on</text>
  <text start="2532.07" dur="7.05">the planet a way to identify themselves</text>
  <text start="2535.04" dur="8.04">on line one ID number for each</text>
  <text start="2539.12" dur="7.05">person to signify all that they are this</text>
  <text start="2543.08" dur="5.37">is the full personal profile containing</text>
  <text start="2546.17" dur="5.49">anything relevant for identification</text>
  <text start="2548.45" dur="5.4">purposes it means all our private</text>
  <text start="2551.66" dur="5.94">details being managed by a corporation</text>
  <text start="2553.85" dur="10.14">and this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="2557.6" dur="10.68">accomplish right now now we know we had</text>
  <text start="2563.99" dur="7.2">this terrorist threat and we know it was</text>
  <text start="2568.28" dur="6.39">for a couple of reasons one to scare</text>
  <text start="2571.19" dur="7.11">Americans to show people that terror is</text>
  <text start="2574.67" dur="8.01">still out there al-qaeda is still out</text>
  <text start="2578.3" dur="10.77">there to to show why the agencies who</text>
  <text start="2582.68" dur="8.57">spy NSA CIA FBI DHS to show why they are</text>
  <text start="2589.07" dur="5.88">relevant and look how we can capture</text>
  <text start="2591.25" dur="6.6">communication from these terrorists and</text>
  <text start="2594.95" dur="6.9">thank God we did because we saved</text>
  <text start="2597.85" dur="7.69">everything that was going on and we call</text>
  <text start="2601.85" dur="5.13">them out on it and everything is okay</text>
  <text start="2605.54" dur="4.86">right now and we opened up some</text>
  <text start="2606.98" dur="8.34">embassies except for Yemen during this</text>
  <text start="2610.4" dur="9.2">time period the US Navy solicited 12</text>
  <text start="2615.32" dur="8.09">more drones for possible Yemen strikes</text>
  <text start="2619.6" dur="7.11">Yemen has been hit with at least eight</text>
  <text start="2623.41" dur="8.23">drone strikes during this period the</text>
  <text start="2626.71" dur="7.27">embassy in Yemen is still closed and</text>
  <text start="2631.64" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re still having a problem if</text>
  <text start="2633.98" dur="7.14">remember Yemen is the choke point for</text>
  <text start="2636.65" dur="7.71">the Gulf of Aden and Yemen is again</text>
  <text start="2641.12" dur="5.72">they&amp;#39;re losing control of the people who</text>
  <text start="2644.36" dur="6.51">are rising up and want the puppet</text>
  <text start="2646.84" dur="7">government out and this is one of their</text>
  <text start="2650.87" dur="5.79">major problems as of right now the other</text>
  <text start="2653.84" dur="5.13">ones I&amp;#39;m assuming right now they have</text>
  <text start="2656.66" dur="4.74">some type of control but Yemen is</text>
  <text start="2658.97" dur="5.76">completely out of control and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2661.4" dur="8.31">trying to reel everything back in and</text>
  <text start="2664.73" dur="6.48">now John McCain is out there and he just</text>
  <text start="2669.71" dur="2.92">wants to let everyone know that the</text>
  <text start="2671.21" dur="4.3">terror threat is</text>
  <text start="2672.63" dur="5.64">worse than ever McCain says look al</text>
  <text start="2675.51" dur="5.22">Qaeda is on the rise they have continued</text>
  <text start="2678.27" dur="7.38">to penetrate they have now a free zone</text>
  <text start="2680.73" dur="7.23">in Iraq and Syria areas the border al al</text>
  <text start="2685.65" dur="4.74">Qaeda is strengthening every day in</text>
  <text start="2687.96" dur="5.52">every way because of a lack of American</text>
  <text start="2690.39" dur="6.21">leadership and policy and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2693.48" dur="5.01">saying is they have metastasized in a</text>
  <text start="2696.6" dur="4.35">way that may pose great threats</text>
  <text start="2698.49" dur="5.01">throughout the Middle East that they can</text>
  <text start="2700.95" dur="4.77">destabilize nations that they can commit</text>
  <text start="2703.5" dur="3.93">acts of terror literally anywhere and</text>
  <text start="2705.72" dur="3.6">there&amp;#39;s the perception throughout the</text>
  <text start="2707.43" dur="5.28">Middle East that there&amp;#39;s no American</text>
  <text start="2709.32" dur="4.95">leadership there&amp;#39;s no policy we are what</text>
  <text start="2712.71" dur="3.96">he&amp;#39;s saying is we are losing control</text>
  <text start="2714.27" dur="4.62">over the place will blame this on al</text>
  <text start="2716.67" dur="5.28">Qaeda we need to get into the Middle</text>
  <text start="2718.89" dur="5.58">East with boots on the ground from the</text>
  <text start="2721.95" dur="4.74">u.s. to bring everything back into</text>
  <text start="2724.47" dur="5.12">control that&amp;#39;s what he really wants and</text>
  <text start="2726.69" dur="11.34">it might happen which it probably will</text>
  <text start="2729.59" dur="10.51">and President Obama you know was saying</text>
  <text start="2738.03" dur="4.02">that you know al Qaeda is on the run and</text>
  <text start="2740.1" dur="4.23">then they&amp;#39;re now other reports saying</text>
  <text start="2742.05" dur="5.43">that they were wrong al Qaeda is not on</text>
  <text start="2744.33" dur="5.64">the run they are getting stronger they</text>
  <text start="2747.48" dur="6.42">are in more places than they thought</text>
  <text start="2749.97" dur="7.17">it&amp;#39;s getting worse and Representative</text>
  <text start="2753.9" dur="9.69">Mike McCaul Republican in Texas says</text>
  <text start="2757.14" dur="8.73">it&amp;#39;s the threat is huge it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="2763.59" dur="4.5">worse and we need to deal with it in a</text>
  <text start="2765.87" dur="5.88">responsible way and not put our head in</text>
  <text start="2768.09" dur="6.15">the sand and we&amp;#39;re seeing them build up</text>
  <text start="2771.75" dur="6.23">the propaganda to go after al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="2774.24" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re making it bigger than life and</text>
  <text start="2777.98" dur="6.16">there will still I mean there&amp;#39;s still a</text>
  <text start="2780.63" dur="5.7">travel travel advisory in effect making</text>
  <text start="2784.14" dur="7.59">all Americans afraid to leave the</text>

  <text start="2791.73" dur="9.26">twelfth right now they&amp;#39;re still a threat</text>
  <text start="2797.43" dur="8.27">going on throughout the Middle East and</text>
  <text start="2800.99" dur="6.96">they&amp;#39;re still losing the battle in syria</text>
  <text start="2805.7" dur="4.95">and there they need to get the war</text>
  <text start="2807.95" dur="7.76">started somehow so they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="2810.65" dur="10.44">to do something to get themselves into</text>
  <text start="2815.71" dur="8.86">Syria and then into Iran so we will be</text>
  <text start="2821.09" dur="5.52">seeing some type of false flag still</text>
  <text start="2824.57" dur="3.93">coming even though there&amp;#39;s a lull and</text>
  <text start="2826.61" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re saying everything&amp;#39;s okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2828.5" dur="5.13">when it usually hits when the threat</text>
  <text start="2831.47" dur="7.26">dies down everyone gets comfortable and</text>
  <text start="2833.63" dur="7.34">then BOOM al-qaeda strikes again and we</text>
  <text start="2838.73" dur="5.22">will probably see something like this</text>
