  <text start="49.32" dur="4.769">Greek people they elected the sorriso</text>
  <text start="51.6" dur="5.19">party because they promised no more</text>
  <text start="54.089" dur="4.53">austerity they promised economic growth</text>
  <text start="56.79" dur="3.93">they promised they weren&amp;#39;t going to go</text>
  <text start="58.619" dur="4.83">along with more debt that if we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="60.72" dur="6.649">to get rid of the dent and we can see</text>
  <text start="63.449" dur="5.971">right now the syriza party decided to</text>
  <text start="67.369" dur="6.631">negotiate with the Eurogroup and they</text>
  <text start="69.42" dur="9.059">came up with a four-month extension and</text>
  <text start="74" dur="5.95">this four-month extension is going to do</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="5.401">what for them may give some breathing</text>
  <text start="79.95" dur="6.72">space of course but the question is did</text>

  <text start="99.719" dur="6.051">to be very angry and we might see an</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="5.97">overthrow of the government now Greece</text>
  <text start="105.77" dur="5.29">already missed their first commitment on</text>

  <text start="112.14" dur="3.509">now they said they were going to have</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="4.86">this on Tuesday but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="115.649" dur="4.201">interesting is that a cereza MP asked</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="4.14">three hundred and thirty billion</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="6.329">question how will four-month extension</text>
  <text start="122.85" dur="7.53">improve our negotiation position well it</text>
  <text start="126.179" dur="8.671">won&amp;#39;t and the question is why are we</text>
  <text start="130.38" dur="7.95">doing this he&amp;#39;s asking well I&amp;#39;m hoping</text>
  <text start="134.85" dur="5.669">that they have another plan because if</text>
  <text start="138.33" dur="2.7">their plan is not to go with Russia or</text>
  <text start="140.519" dur="2.671">China but</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="7.05">to negotiate with the ECB with the</text>
  <text start="143.19" dur="7.41">Eurogroup they&amp;#39;re going to force them to</text>
  <text start="148.08" dur="5.28">pay back this debt because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="150.6" dur="5.76">want the series of virus to spread</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="4.77">across Europe they don&amp;#39;t want other</text>
  <text start="156.36" dur="4.65">countries to say hey wait a minute</text>
  <text start="158.13" dur="7.32">Greece just got to write off that debt</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="6.18">we want the same exact thing Russia has</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="4.98">been holding out its hand saying listen</text>
  <text start="167.19" dur="5.58">if you come over to us what we can do is</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="4.83">we can remove the food BAM we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="172.77" dur="5.07">to be building the gas pipeline in your</text>
  <text start="175.26" dur="6.12">country and we can help you spur</text>
  <text start="177.84" dur="5.7">economic growth what has the Eurogroup</text>
  <text start="181.38" dur="3.9">given them we will give you debt will</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="4.44">give you more debt and we will give you</text>
  <text start="185.28" dur="6.36">more debt and of course austerity will</text>
  <text start="187.98" dur="5.85">come along with this so hopefully</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re looking at the situation and</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="5.25">giving themselves breathing room because</text>
  <text start="196.8" dur="5.43">we know the maturity date does come up</text>
  <text start="199.08" dur="4.89">in four months and we&amp;#39;re hoping that</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="3.45">they make the right decision or this</text>
  <text start="203.97" dur="3.96">entire government is going to go down</text>
  <text start="205.68" dur="3.54">the tubes and the people are going to</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="3.779">say enough is enough and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="4.7">to kick them out because they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="211.709" dur="7.291">dealing this dealing with all of this</text>
  <text start="213.92" dur="8.23">since 2008 and nothing has changed this</text>
  <text start="219" dur="4.62">doesn&amp;#39;t help the people right now so</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="3.899">we&amp;#39;re going to continue to watch this to</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="4.56">see what occurs now here in the United</text>
  <text start="226.049" dur="5.72">States we see the dallas fed</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="7.429">manufacturing plunged in january</text>
  <text start="231.769" dur="8.53">february&amp;#39;s data plunged to a negative</text>
  <text start="235.609" dur="7.72">11.2 against a negative for drop this is</text>
  <text start="240.299" dur="4.891">the third miss in a row so it looks like</text>
  <text start="243.329" dur="4.141">things are not going well and we can see</text>
  <text start="245.19" dur="6.51">down in Texas because of the oil</text>
  <text start="247.47" dur="6.72">suppression they could lose somewhere in</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="5.31">the range of about a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="5.76">thousand jobs will be lost because of</text>
  <text start="257.01" dur="6.38">this and the initial job jobless claims</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="6.33">in Texas is skyrocketing right now and</text>
  <text start="263.39" dur="4.96">what&amp;#39;s funny is the Texas the Texas</text>
  <text start="266.28" dur="5.04">initial jobless claims is skyrocketing</text>
  <text start="268.35" dur="5.79">and the overall United States initial</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="3.54">jobless claims are falling how can this</text>
  <text start="274.14" dur="2.64">possibly be</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="4.44">well we know the US government</text>
  <text start="276.78" dur="4.109">manipulates a lot of the numbers they</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="2.76">don&amp;#39;t count those people and of course</text>
  <text start="280.889" dur="2.911">they&amp;#39;re not going to count those people</text>
  <text start="282.06" dur="4.789">who are losing their job in the oil</text>
  <text start="283.8" dur="6.69">sector and we can see retail spending</text>
  <text start="286.849" dur="6.1">shows absolutely no sign of low gas</text>
  <text start="290.49" dur="3.78">price tax cut stimulus and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="292.949" dur="3.78">discussed this many many times before</text>
  <text start="294.27" dur="4.799">when the US government the central</text>
  <text start="296.729" dur="4.051">bankers and all the talking heads on the</text>
  <text start="299.069" dur="3">corporate media all thought oh since</text>
  <text start="300.78" dur="3.389">we&amp;#39;re going to lower the gas prices</text>
  <text start="302.069" dur="4.291">we&amp;#39;re going to see economic growth in</text>
  <text start="304.169" dur="5.28">the retail sector well we actually saw</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="4.679">the opposite we saw more and more stores</text>
  <text start="309.449" dur="7.161">closed we saw the holiday season a</text>
  <text start="311.039" dur="9.301">complete disaster and it has not helped</text>
  <text start="316.61" dur="6.22">whatsoever and we see the only way for</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="5.639">the government the central bankers to</text>
  <text start="322.83" dur="6.059">prop up this entire economy are to do</text>
  <text start="325.979" dur="6.18">things they can control they can control</text>
  <text start="328.889" dur="5.881">who gets loans they can control the</text>
  <text start="332.159" dur="5.16">stock market they can control the</text>
  <text start="334.77" dur="5.819">manipulated numbers like GDP inflation</text>
  <text start="337.319" dur="5.611">unemployment they can control the</text>
  <text start="340.589" dur="4.771">suppression of oil they can control the</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="5.25">precious metals to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="4.919">economy is doing well but what happens</text>
  <text start="348.18" dur="4.44">is they create bubbles in certain areas</text>
  <text start="350.279" dur="4.591">like the real estate market like the</text>
  <text start="352.62" dur="5.759">auto industry like the student loan</text>
  <text start="354.87" dur="8.599">industry because they&amp;#39;re trying to prop</text>
  <text start="358.379" dur="10.29">it up with crap with junk and when you</text>
  <text start="363.469" dur="8.35">create something using junk you get junk</text>
  <text start="368.669" dur="5.011">back ten times the amount that you put</text>
  <text start="371.819" dur="4.62">in and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="373.68" dur="5.239">now I mean when we look at the auto loan</text>
  <text start="376.439" dur="4.921">industry we see new and used vehicles</text>
  <text start="378.919" dur="5.62">the amount of loans out there is</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="7.109">approaching one trillion dollars and</text>
  <text start="384.539" dur="5.34">this is coming from experian but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.469" dur="3.931">out there saying and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="389.879" dur="5.551">malinta zabinski the group director of</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="4.65">automotive finance whenever there is an</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="3.87">uptick in the number of loans to</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="4.829">subprime and deep subprime customers</text>
  <text start="399.3" dur="5.099">there is a potential for the sky falling</text>
  <text start="401.879" dur="4.65">type of reaction well we saw this happen</text>
  <text start="404.399" dur="4.181">in the real estate industry but the</text>
  <text start="406.529" dur="4.63">reality is we are looking at a room</text>
  <text start="408.58" dur="5.429">markedly stable automotive lon market in</text>
  <text start="411.159" dur="5.01">part because consumers are continuing to</text>
  <text start="414.009" dur="4.951">stay on top of their payments well</text>
  <text start="416.169" dur="6.06">actually not actually they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="418.96" dur="6.15">telling the truth as we all know all</text>
  <text start="422.229" dur="4.381">these people do it because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="425.11" dur="3.989">trying to make it seem like things are</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="4.859">okay and they&amp;#39;re being directed to say</text>
  <text start="429.099" dur="5.72">yes things are okay but when we look at</text>
  <text start="431.469" dur="5.431">the situation we see early delinquencies</text>
  <text start="434.819" dur="3.611">borrowers who have missed a payment</text>
  <text start="436.9" dur="4.94">within the eight months of origination</text>
  <text start="438.43" dur="6.359">are at the highest level since 2008</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="5.079">subprime auto loans became triple-a</text>
  <text start="444.789" dur="5.19">rating structure securities that we saw</text>
  <text start="446.919" dur="5.28">this before in the real estate subprime</text>
  <text start="449.979" dur="4.351">market where they said off these are</text>
  <text start="452.199" dur="5.161">triple-a these are great investments and</text>
  <text start="454.33" dur="5.04">the entire thing collapsed about thirty</text>
  <text start="457.36" dur="4.649">one percent of all outstanding auto</text>
  <text start="459.37" dur="5.039">loans balances are rated subprime right</text>
  <text start="462.009" dur="6.81">now they&amp;#39;re the foundation of the</text>
  <text start="464.409" dur="8.22">booming auto sales the average APR on</text>
  <text start="468.819" dur="7.16">those loans are nineteen percent the</text>
  <text start="472.629" dur="5.641">original turn lymph is 70 months</text>
  <text start="475.979" dur="4.331">seventy-five percent of these loans had</text>
  <text start="478.27" dur="4.47">a loan-to-value ratio of over one</text>
  <text start="480.31" dur="4.349">hundred and five percent eighty-one</text>
  <text start="482.74" dur="4.62">percent of the bars had a FICO score</text>
  <text start="484.659" dur="4.29">less than six hundred and some of the</text>
  <text start="487.36" dur="5.729">securities that these loans are turned</text>
  <text start="488.949" dur="6.84">into r rated triple-a here we go again</text>
  <text start="493.089" dur="5.19">and we know the delinquencies have risen</text>
  <text start="495.789" dur="5">and we see a lot of people are getting</text>
  <text start="498.279" dur="6.151">their cars repossessed at this time</text>
  <text start="500.789" dur="6.13">every time an official or somebody comes</text>
  <text start="504.43" dur="5.76">out and says everything is fine the</text>
  <text start="506.919" dur="6.78">subprime loans are perfect people are</text>
  <text start="510.19" dur="5.49">really you know paying them we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.699" dur="4.981">the complete opposite government</text>
  <text start="515.68" dur="5.13">officials central bankers we know this</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="5.01">is the complete opposite you cannot</text>
  <text start="520.81" dur="4.26">build an economy on people who do not</text>
  <text start="523.69" dur="2.579">have worked now I&amp;#39;m not saying these</text>
  <text start="525.07" dur="3.3">people there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with these</text>
  <text start="526.269" dur="6.361">people I&amp;#39;m saying these people got</text>
  <text start="528.37" dur="7.02">dragged into a time frame in the US</text>
  <text start="532.63" dur="4.47">where things went south back in two</text>
  <text start="535.39" dur="4.02">thousand eight people got a lot of their</text>

  <text start="542.13" dur="3.99">their house was taken away and they</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="4.68">could never recover from what happened</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="4.62">and of course their cars getting older</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="3.12">things are getting older and they need</text>
  <text start="550.74" dur="4.56">to purchase these things and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="552.03" dur="5.76">have the money and the only way to do</text>
  <text start="555.3" dur="3.84">this is to go in and get a loan and of</text>
  <text start="557.79" dur="3.6">course there&amp;#39;s subprime because what</text>
  <text start="559.14" dur="4.65">they had things happen to them they had</text>
  <text start="561.39" dur="4.89">to go in and get loans and they realize</text>
  <text start="563.79" dur="4.08">that as they keep working or maybe one</text>
  <text start="566.28" dur="3.72">of the stores they were working for that</text>
  <text start="567.87" dur="4.14">store closed or they laid off people</text>
  <text start="570" dur="6.42">because sales are so bad they&amp;#39;re back in</text>
  <text start="572.01" dur="6.81">the same situation and this is not going</text>
  <text start="576.42" dur="4.05">to get better anytime soon it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="578.82" dur="3.75">going to get worse as time goes on and</text>
  <text start="580.47" dur="4.41">as I&amp;#39;ve been reporting all of this we</text>
  <text start="582.57" dur="6.06">have seen that things have definitely</text>
  <text start="584.88" dur="5.51">gotten worse not better even though the</text>

  <text start="766.87" dur="5.04">people in the mortgage department going</text>
  <text start="768.97" dur="6">as far back as August of 2013 when Obama</text>

  <text start="789.79" dur="5.82">and it has continued all the way up to</text>
  <text start="791.92" dur="6.81">the present time why would you lay off</text>
  <text start="795.61" dur="5.76">all of these people if the housing</text>

  <text start="834.97" dur="5.22">prices they come down this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="838.81" dur="3.21">seeing right now of course the</text>
  <text start="840.19" dur="4.05">government is trying to use everything</text>
  <text start="842.02" dur="5.7">they possibly can to continually prop</text>

  <text start="864.73" dur="6">closer and closer to a collapse I mean</text>
  <text start="868.3" dur="4.8">look at the bowl to dry index it is at</text>
  <text start="870.73" dur="4.77">its lowest point and if you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="873.1" dur="4.74">if that is that is the raw material that</text>
  <text start="875.5" dur="4.23">is used for manufacturing when people go</text>
  <text start="877.84" dur="4.62">to different areas and they purchase</text>
  <text start="879.73" dur="4.32">goods manufacturers will produce to get</text>
  <text start="882.46" dur="3.9">that in to get that material they need</text>
  <text start="884.05" dur="4.26">raw material and these are the ships</text>
  <text start="886.36" dur="3.48">that carry the raw material and what</text>
  <text start="888.31" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a complete</text>
  <text start="889.84" dur="5.4">collapse of the entire system because</text>
  <text start="892" dur="4.56">people aren&amp;#39;t buying manufacturers don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="895.24" dur="4.47">have to produce they don&amp;#39;t have to order</text>
  <text start="896.56" dur="7.86">the raw materials so we can see right</text>
  <text start="899.71" dur="7.83">now that even shipbuilders I mean I</text>
  <text start="904.42" dur="7.07">shippers are saying that this is the</text>
  <text start="907.54" dur="12.12">worst market condition since the 1980s</text>
  <text start="911.49" dur="10.6">and ship bulk shippers are filing for</text>
  <text start="919.66" dur="4.14">bankruptcy this is the second one</text>
  <text start="922.09" dur="5.55">already that is filed for bankruptcy</text>

  <text start="934.99" dur="4.38">how can we prop this up a little bit</text>
  <text start="936.79" dur="4.98">longer because we need to get this war</text>
  <text start="939.37" dur="3.449">started we need everyone&amp;#39;s eyes off of</text>
  <text start="941.77" dur="3.149">us and we</text>
  <text start="942.819" dur="5.01">need to blame some other group or</text>
  <text start="944.919" dur="6.26">country for this entire economic</text>
  <text start="947.829" dur="6.06">collapse now the boat that got dry index</text>
  <text start="951.179" dur="4.87">moved up last week about two or three</text>
  <text start="953.889" dur="5.91">points it has started to drop down again</text>
  <text start="956.049" dur="6.33">1 point 2 512 points so it&amp;#39;s bouncing</text>

  <text start="965.709" dur="6.21">of 1986 which i think it was around 5 40</text>
  <text start="968.289" dur="5.88">or so around those that number and when</text>

  <text start="975.789" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re having a very rough time because</text>

  <text start="1048.929" dur="9.75">getting harder and harder for people to</text>
  <text start="1051.86" dur="8.23">survive and as time goes on everyone is</text>
  <text start="1058.679" dur="3.63">going to start to wonder and scratch</text>
  <text start="1060.09" dur="4.86">their head saying what is going on here</text>
  <text start="1062.309" dur="5.131">especially when the economy starts to</text>
  <text start="1064.95" dur="4.89">collapse and we will see this when you</text>
  <text start="1067.44" dur="4.5">see gold prices starting to move up and</text>
  <text start="1069.84" dur="6.02">i&amp;#39;m not talking about ten dollars twenty</text>

  <text start="1078.98" dur="5.91">something&amp;#39;s going on here yes we see</text>
  <text start="1082.429" dur="5.401">fluctuations and the central bank drops</text>
  <text start="1084.89" dur="6.32">it back down but you will know you will</text>
  <text start="1087.83" dur="6.36">cease things happen you will see war</text>
  <text start="1091.21" dur="7.24">being really pushed out in the Middle</text>
  <text start="1094.19" dur="6.119">East in Eastern Europe and you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="1098.45" dur="3.9">more fighting going on I mean we have</text>
  <text start="1100.309" dur="5.071">seen more fighting but it will become</text>
  <text start="1102.35" dur="6.27">more intense that means we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1105.38" dur="4.679">very very close to the collapse and when</text>
  <text start="1108.62" dur="3.87">we look at all the countries around the</text>
  <text start="1110.059" dur="5.37">world in the private central bank world</text>
  <text start="1112.49" dur="6.179">i should say we see that their debt to</text>
  <text start="1115.429" dur="5.781">gdp is over three hundred percent japan</text>
  <text start="1118.669" dur="10.351">ireland singapore Portugal Belgium</text>

  <text start="1132.11" dur="5.13">United States is at two hundred and</text>
  <text start="1134.179" dur="6.861">thirty-three percent and this makes it</text>
  <text start="1137.24" dur="6.72">very very rough for every single country</text>
  <text start="1141.04" dur="4.84">and let me just say it comes out to be</text>
  <text start="1143.96" dur="5.4">about thirty nine percent of the</text>
  <text start="1145.88" dur="7.26">countries have debt to gdp over one</text>
  <text start="1149.36" dur="5.13">hundred percent this cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="1153.14" dur="2.82">you can see it in Greece that was the</text>
  <text start="1154.49" dur="4.71">experiment if you&amp;#39;d like to call that</text>
  <text start="1155.96" dur="5.43">they kept giving them debt debt debt it</text>
  <text start="1159.2" dur="5.599">kept having austerity people out of work</text>
  <text start="1161.39" dur="5.82">people out of work what happened</text>
  <text start="1164.799" dur="4.51">basically their country collapsed that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1167.21" dur="5.219">really what it is their country has</text>
  <text start="1169.309" dur="6.24">collapsed youth unemployment over sixty</text>
  <text start="1172.429" dur="5.551">percent overall unemployment thirty</text>
  <text start="1175.549" dur="4.051">percent actually most likely it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="1177.98" dur="4.319">much worse than that but those are the</text>
  <text start="1179.6" dur="5.31">government numbers we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1182.299" dur="5.13">that they have so much that there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1184.91" dur="4.74">way out of this the only way out of it</text>
  <text start="1187.429" dur="5.761">is to say you know what let&amp;#39;s write this</text>
  <text start="1189.65" dur="5.76">off so their country really collapsed</text>
  <text start="1193.19" dur="4.2">people living on the streets all over</text>
  <text start="1195.41" dur="6.48">the place they have no way of getting</text>
  <text start="1197.39" dur="6.63">food and there&amp;#39;s no shelter for them the</text>
  <text start="1201.89" dur="3.75">same thing is going to happen in all the</text>
  <text start="1204.02" dur="3.3">private western central bank countries</text>
  <text start="1205.64" dur="3.48">now of course they&amp;#39;re going to blame</text>
  <text start="1207.32" dur="3.6">this on something else</text>
  <text start="1209.12" dur="5.73">but the kit will not stop the collapse</text>
  <text start="1210.92" dur="5.97">that will happen because there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="1214.85" dur="7.44">to stop it they&amp;#39;re just going to mask it</text>
  <text start="1216.89" dur="8.55">with something else like war remember</text>
  <text start="1222.29" dur="6.3">when Obama was out there and he</text>
  <text start="1225.44" dur="5.1">continually tells us all these different</text>
  <text start="1228.59" dur="5.31">lies they have to remember Obama is just</text>
  <text start="1230.54" dur="5.48">a pawn he takes orders from above and</text>
  <text start="1233.9" dur="6.96">the central bankers from the elite and</text>
  <text start="1236.02" dur="6.46">what to do but again we can just see by</text>
  <text start="1240.86" dur="3.48">all of these people every government</text>
  <text start="1242.48" dur="3.84">official that&amp;#39;s out there they always</text>
  <text start="1244.34" dur="5.64">tell us the opposite of what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1246.32" dur="5.91">going on they never tell us the truth</text>
  <text start="1249.98" dur="3.92">they always make us believe something</text>
  <text start="1252.23" dur="4.65">else they back it up with more lies I</text>
  <text start="1253.9" dur="6.73">mean if we look back at what Obama has</text>
  <text start="1256.88" dur="5.99">told us I mean we see that he really</text>
  <text start="1260.63" dur="4.679">didn&amp;#39;t tell us the truth he said we</text>

  <text start="2602.38" dur="5.909">were unemployed in Texas and other</text>
  <text start="2605.979" dur="4.681">states because of the oil suppression</text>
  <text start="2608.289" dur="3.92">well wouldn&amp;#39;t that hurt the economy how</text>
  <text start="2610.66" dur="4.679">come it&amp;#39;s only these a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="2612.209" dur="6.79">basically what he&amp;#39;s doing is he is using</text>
  <text start="2615.339" dur="6.291">propaganda just like DHS is doing</text>
  <text start="2618.999" dur="7.83">telling us that there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="2621.63" dur="9.219">mole event where Al Shabaab is going to</text>
  <text start="2626.829" dur="7.17">be attacking maybe a mall in the UK or</text>

  <text start="2633.999" dur="3.8">the mole of America now Jay Johnson is</text>
  <text start="2636.67" dur="4.5">out there he&amp;#39;s giving mixed messages</text>
  <text start="2637.799" dur="5.53">saying yes we&amp;#39;ve seen the video but we</text>
  <text start="2641.17" dur="4.77">have no evidence of it but you need to</text>
  <text start="2643.329" dur="6.39">patch past my budget because of these</text>
  <text start="2645.94" dur="5.789">type of events well let me just say if</text>
  <text start="2649.719" dur="4.441">they pass the budget this event will</text>
  <text start="2651.729" dur="4.89">disappear if they don&amp;#39;t pass the budget</text>
  <text start="2654.16" dur="4.379">we most likely will see a false flag</text>
  <text start="2656.619" dur="3.9">event in a mall somewhere around the</text>
  <text start="2658.539" dur="5.131">United States how do we know that they</text>
  <text start="2660.519" dur="9.48">are planning on this well the US has</text>
  <text start="2663.67" dur="9.449">been practicing staging mock mall tax to</text>
  <text start="2669.999" dur="6.48">test some type of terrorist attack</text>
  <text start="2673.119" dur="3.871">inside them all this is how we know</text>
  <text start="2676.479" dur="2.941">there</text>
  <text start="2676.99" dur="5.91">before to use at any time they need to</text>
  <text start="2679.42" dur="9.09">use it just like Sandy Hook the shooting</text>
  <text start="2682.9" dur="7.8">there just like the Boston bombing they</text>
  <text start="2688.51" dur="4.56">prepare they get ready they use it when</text>
  <text start="2690.7" dur="4.5">they need it looking look at Canada with</text>
  <text start="2693.07" dur="5.25">their false flag look at France look at</text>
  <text start="2695.2" dur="8.07">Australia all of these are false flag</text>
  <text start="2698.32" dur="7.92">they&amp;#39;re not real yes do people die in it</text>
  <text start="2703.27" dur="6.15">some people died some people don&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="2706.24" dur="5.129">all depends on the false flag 911 a lot</text>
  <text start="2709.42" dur="6.36">of people died I know a couple people</text>
  <text start="2711.369" dur="7.141">that died in 911 so when people think of</text>
  <text start="2715.78" dur="4.31">a false flag it&amp;#39;s not always completely</text>
  <text start="2718.51" dur="4.4">fake where nobody sees anything</text>
  <text start="2720.09" dur="5.49">sometimes people do get hurt and die</text>
  <text start="2722.91" dur="6.76">because they need to push the point out</text>
  <text start="2725.58" dur="7.21">there to show yes they&amp;#39;re dangerous but</text>
  <text start="2729.67" dur="5.19">a lot of them we see our fate especially</text>
  <text start="2732.79" dur="3.66">those videos they capture when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2734.86" dur="4.05">always in the right place to capture</text>
  <text start="2736.45" dur="5.01">them and we can see with the warning</text>
  <text start="2738.91" dur="5.88">from DHS right now they&amp;#39;re using it for</text>
  <text start="2741.46" dur="5.61">a specific agenda their budget if they</text>
  <text start="2744.79" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t get it a hundred thousand people</text>
  <text start="2747.07" dur="5.07">are not going to get their paycheck and</text>
  <text start="2749.05" dur="5.7">the private police force of the White</text>
  <text start="2752.14" dur="6.24">House won&amp;#39;t be out there this is what</text>
  <text start="2754.75" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re worried about and if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2758.38" dur="4.65">get their budget passed we will see the</text>
  <text start="2760.84" dur="5.88">event most likely if the budget is</text>
  <text start="2763.03" dur="6.48">passed guess what it will disappear but</text>
  <text start="2766.72" dur="7.41">again all of this has been readied for</text>
