  <text start="90.289" dur="5.851">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="93.05" dur="6.45">financial news now in Greece we talked</text>
  <text start="96.14" dur="5.07">about how people are taking their</text>
  <text start="99.5" dur="3.81">currency out of the banks and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="101.21" dur="5.88">seeing right now is that this is</text>
  <text start="103.31" dur="6.66">accelerating it is not slowing people</text>
  <text start="107.09" dur="3.869">are continually taking more and more of</text>
  <text start="109.97" dur="3.27">their currency and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="110.959" dur="4.681">right now is that bank deposits they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="113.24" dur="5.61">tumble to the lowest since 2001 in the</text>
  <text start="115.64" dur="4.799">banks and the situation there is getting</text>
  <text start="118.85" dur="3.54">worse and this is why they said listen</text>
  <text start="120.439" dur="3.901">we can&amp;#39;t do balance right now in Greece</text>
  <text start="122.39" dur="4.68">because it will hurt the creditors and</text>
  <text start="124.34" dur="5.309">what&amp;#39;s happening is is that the outflow</text>
  <text start="127.07" dur="4.47">of currency well it&amp;#39;s making it very</text>
  <text start="129.649" dur="4.801">difficult to do balance and people</text>
  <text start="131.54" dur="4.86">realize this they understood what would</text>
  <text start="134.45" dur="3.84">happen because they look at Cypress and</text>
  <text start="136.4" dur="4.589">they knew that if they keep their</text>
  <text start="138.29" dur="5.25">currency in the bank it would be trapped</text>
  <text start="140.989" dur="5.78">there so this made it more and more</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="6.78">difficult for them to do a balun and</text>
  <text start="146.769" dur="5.351">again my personal opinion is only keep</text>
  <text start="150.32" dur="4.38">as much as you possibly can in the bank</text>
  <text start="152.12" dur="5.459">because if we get into or when we get</text>
  <text start="154.7" dur="4.89">into that Baylen situation guess what</text>
  <text start="157.579" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re going to have a bank holiday the</text>
  <text start="159.59" dur="3.69">system is going to shut down you will</text>
  <text start="161.329" dur="3.601">not be able to get your currency it will</text>
  <text start="163.28" dur="4.079">be stuck in the bank they&amp;#39;ll be capital</text>
  <text start="164.93" dur="4.26">controls that will put that will be put</text>
  <text start="167.359" dur="4.921">into effect and you will not be able to</text>
  <text start="169.19" dur="6.18">get any of your hard-earned currency now</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="5.459">I would personally keep currency on hand</text>
  <text start="175.37" dur="4.44">I would keep gold and silver as an</text>
  <text start="177.739" dur="3.311">insurance policy we can see right now</text>
  <text start="179.81" dur="3.58">that</text>
  <text start="181.05" dur="4.2">the former fed Greenspan he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="183.39" dur="4.59">yeah I would keep gold as an insurance</text>
  <text start="185.25" dur="5.3">policy countries now are loading up on</text>
  <text start="187.98" dur="7.35">gold so I would do the exact same thing</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="7.21">now in almost 20 states right now we see</text>
  <text start="195.33" dur="4.02">that they have raised the gas prices</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="5.79">remember when the gas prices came down</text>
  <text start="199.35" dur="7.8">well our government officials thought</text>
  <text start="203.55" dur="8.19">this would be a perfect opportunity to</text>
  <text start="207.15" dur="7.23">raise gas taxes and we can see that</text>
  <text start="211.74" dur="5.28">nearly 20 states well they raise gas</text>
  <text start="214.38" dur="5.01">taxes or we calculated the gas tax</text>
  <text start="217.02" dur="5.64">formulas hoping that no one would notice</text>
  <text start="219.39" dur="5.28">because the price of fuel is much lower</text>
  <text start="222.66" dur="3.54">than it was and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="224.67" dur="6.06">there are many states that are adding on</text>
  <text start="226.2" dur="6.24">30 40 cents or more than 40 cents to the</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="4.29">fuel out there now what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="232.44" dur="9.03">happen is that as people pay more and</text>
  <text start="235.02" dur="9.21">more towards fuel well guess what this</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="4.35">is going to hurt once again it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="244.23" dur="5.61">going to make the situation situation</text>
  <text start="245.82" dur="6.66">better it&amp;#39;s almost like the soda tax in</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="4.29">philadelphia where they thought oh let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="3.27">put a tax on this we&amp;#39;re going to get all</text>
  <text start="254.13" dur="3.81">this new revenue and then all of a</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="4.85">sudden well things started going the</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="4.979">other way people bought less sold soda</text>
  <text start="260.6" dur="5.77">hurting the distributor&amp;#39;s the bottlers</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="6.031">and we can see right now this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="7.47">going to happen I mean right now the</text>
  <text start="268.95" dur="8.82">demand for fuel is declining and once</text>
  <text start="273.84" dur="5.97">this gas tax goes into effect and many</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="4.62">states that already has the demand is</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="6.45">going to sink even lower it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="282.39" dur="6.15">be a horrible situation we see that GM</text>
  <text start="286.26" dur="4.29">well it looks like they&amp;#39;re doing exactly</text>
  <text start="288.54" dur="4.65">what they did back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="290.55" dur="5.82">when things go bad what do you do you</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="6.81">give out incentives because incentive</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="5.76">surged to over eighty percent now we</text>
  <text start="300" dur="5.34">understand that we&amp;#39;re in an auto bubble</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="5.85">we understand that there&amp;#39;s delinquents</text>
  <text start="305.34" dur="6.329">the delinquency rate is moving up and up</text>
  <text start="307.98" dur="4.11">and up it&amp;#39;s not getting better and when</text>
  <text start="311.669" dur="4.351">we look</text>
  <text start="312.09" dur="7.2">at the subprime securitization book we</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="5.399">see that in January of 2017 delinquency</text>
  <text start="319.29" dur="7.83">rates they&amp;#39;re soaring to the highest</text>
  <text start="321.419" dur="7.921">level since 2009 early 2010 and this</text>
  <text start="327.12" dur="4.41">does not look good meanwhile looking at</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="5.07">GM subprime data going back two thousand</text>
  <text start="331.53" dur="4.919">one implies historical spikes and two</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="5.13">months Lincoln see rates is fairly</text>
  <text start="336.449" dur="8.101">decent indicator that all is not well</text>
  <text start="339.54" dur="8.39">and what we see now is that GM is</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="7.35">offering these massive incentives and</text>
  <text start="347.93" dur="7.239">guess what they did this before and the</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="6.69">company went bankrupt for it I mean</text>
  <text start="355.169" dur="7.5">discounts are averaging about 6996 for</text>
  <text start="358.59" dur="6.99">like the chevrolet silverado 5315 for</text>
  <text start="362.669" dur="5.31">the GMC sierra and when all this is said</text>
  <text start="365.58" dur="4.709">and done this is not going to turn out</text>
  <text start="367.979" dur="4.891">well we saw this back into the prior to</text>
  <text start="370.289" dur="6.211">two thousand eight and we know what</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="5.46">happened to the auto industry it was a</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="4.74">complete disaster now a couple months</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="4.5">ago we know that the government</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="3.03">officials were out there and there and</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="3.45">the corporate media was out there saying</text>
  <text start="384.27" dur="3.99">yes minimum wage minute let&amp;#39;s raise it</text>
  <text start="386.28" dur="4.71">up let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s do this this is going to</text>
  <text start="388.26" dur="4.8">help the people and people are going</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="4.2">back and forth saying yes minimum wage</text>
  <text start="393.06" dur="4.26">will help minimum wage will not help and</text>
  <text start="395.19" dur="4.979">we&amp;#39;re starting to see the case where</text>
  <text start="397.32" dur="6.77">minimum wage is actually not helping now</text>
  <text start="400.169" dur="8.281">remember the value of the dollar is</text>
  <text start="404.09" dur="7.11">declining if we do not go to the source</text>
  <text start="408.45" dur="6.75">of the problem which is the central bank</text>
  <text start="411.2" dur="7.36">raising the minimum wage over and over</text>
  <text start="415.2" dur="5.58">and over is not going to help we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="418.56" dur="4.89">this since 1970 do you see any</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="5.37">improvement at all or have things gotten</text>
  <text start="423.45" dur="7.5">a lot worse and what companies are doing</text>
  <text start="426.15" dur="8.81">today like Wendy&amp;#39;s like Walmart Home</text>
  <text start="430.95" dur="6.92">Depot McDonald&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re putting in</text>
  <text start="434.96" dur="6.39">robots self</text>
  <text start="437.87" dur="6.96">ow systems where they don&amp;#39;t need people</text>
  <text start="441.35" dur="6.15">and guess what Wendy&amp;#39;s right now has</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="5.27">figured out how to eliminate 31 hours of</text>
  <text start="447.5" dur="5.37">labor per week from its restaurants</text>
  <text start="450.1" dur="5.05">because they looked at raising the</text>
  <text start="452.87" dur="5.07">minimum wage and they said well wait a</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="4.53">minute can we afford this no we can&amp;#39;t or</text>
  <text start="457.94" dur="4.2">maybe we can&amp;#39;t afford it but we want to</text>
  <text start="459.68" dur="6.27">make more profits let&amp;#39;s bring in the</text>
  <text start="462.14" dur="5.25">self-checkout terminals and this is what</text>
  <text start="465.95" dur="4.47">many of the companies are doing and if</text>
  <text start="467.39" dur="4.41">you notice those are growing while the</text>
  <text start="470.42" dur="3.72">people actually checking you out is</text>
  <text start="471.8" dur="4.26">shrinking right now because they realize</text>
  <text start="474.14" dur="3.45">let the people check themselves out we</text>
  <text start="476.06" dur="4.68">need one person standing there they can</text>
  <text start="477.59" dur="5.91">handle five different kiosks and we</text>
  <text start="480.74" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t have to pay five people that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.5" dur="5.61">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing we see</text>
  <text start="486.02" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s a retail apocalypse going on</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="4.44">right now now we&amp;#39;ve been tracking retail</text>
  <text start="490.67" dur="4.83">quite a bit here and we know that retail</text>
  <text start="493.55" dur="3.72">is completely suffering and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="495.5" dur="4.17">because of the weather it&amp;#39;s not because</text>
  <text start="497.27" dur="5.09">people are shopping online it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="499.67" dur="4.98">people don&amp;#39;t have work and if they do</text>
  <text start="502.36" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re making a lot less than they were</text>
  <text start="504.65" dur="4.86">once before and they&amp;#39;re holding on to</text>
  <text start="507.23" dur="6.54">their currency and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="509.51" dur="8.79">right now is that in 2016 it was a very</text>
  <text start="513.77" dur="7.56">rough year for the retailers and we see</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="6.12">that Arab us telepacific son american</text>
  <text start="521.33" dur="5.4">apparel and many others well they went</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="4.44">for and they declared chapter 11</text>
  <text start="526.73" dur="5.42">bankruptcy protection sports authority</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="7.05">same thing now according to Moody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.15" dur="5.95">retail credit analyst Charlie O&amp;#39;Shea the</text>
  <text start="535.91" dur="4.17">environment for retailers in the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="538.1" dur="5.13">likely to get worse before getting</text>
  <text start="540.08" dur="5.82">better Moody&amp;#39;s notes the number of</text>
  <text start="543.23" dur="6.24">distress US retailers has more than</text>
  <text start="545.9" dur="5.85">tripled as tripled since the Great</text>
  <text start="549.47" dur="7.26">Recession so what kind of recovery is</text>
  <text start="551.75" dur="6.87">this not too great and with 5 billion</text>
  <text start="556.73" dur="4.56">worth of debt maturities over the next</text>
  <text start="558.62" dur="6.75">four years the situation is going to get</text>
  <text start="561.29" dur="5.1">much much worse so who&amp;#39;s next where</text>
  <text start="565.37" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re going to be declaring bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="566.39" dur="4.749">or we&amp;#39;re going to see stores closing</text>
  <text start="568.58" dur="7.719">what Clare&amp;#39;s j.crew</text>
  <text start="571.139" dur="9.93">tops route 21 well they&amp;#39;re all having</text>
  <text start="576.299" dur="6.84">problems the 19 retail portfolio Oh</text>
  <text start="581.069" dur="4.8">roughly five billion in debt through</text>
  <text start="583.139" dur="6.961">2020 one with about forty percent of</text>
  <text start="585.869" dur="6.78">this due by the end of 2018 so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.1" dur="6.079">moving into a situation where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="592.649" dur="6.15">going from bad to absolutely awful and</text>
  <text start="596.179" dur="5.44">as we move forward it is not going to</text>
  <text start="598.799" dur="5.34">get any better whatsoever we see</text>
  <text start="601.619" dur="5.64">case-shiller is out and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="604.139" dur="5.341">well mortgage rates are rising but</text>
  <text start="607.259" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s no problem home prices in our 20</text>
  <text start="609.48" dur="5.49">cities they are doing very well well not</text>
  <text start="612.359" dur="4.56">really because when you look at the</text>
  <text start="614.97" dur="3.839">graph of the case-shiller home price</text>
  <text start="616.919" dur="3.21">year-on-year remember their live there</text>
  <text start="618.809" dur="4.411">only looking at certain number of cities</text>
  <text start="620.129" dur="7.591">they have been really flatlined since</text>
  <text start="623.22" dur="7.019">2014 they hit their height in December</text>
  <text start="627.72" dur="4.769">of 2013 since that time they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="630.239" dur="5.85">declining and they&amp;#39;ve been flatlined</text>
  <text start="632.489" dur="6.78">since June of 2014 to the present day</text>
  <text start="636.089" dur="4.68">and what we&amp;#39;re going to see is that</text>
  <text start="639.269" dur="3.841">these prices are going to come down even</text>
  <text start="640.769" dur="6.03">further now when we look outside of the</text>
  <text start="643.11" dur="6.24">20 cities guess what we see houses on</text>
  <text start="646.799" dur="4.26">the market they can&amp;#39;t sell them prices</text>
  <text start="649.35" dur="4.26">are being lowered and lowered and</text>
  <text start="651.059" dur="6.87">lowered we see they finally came out</text>
  <text start="653.61" dur="7.169">with the one point nine percent gdp for</text>
  <text start="657.929" dur="6.15">a fourth quarter and again this is a</text>
  <text start="660.779" dur="5.011">manipulated number Obama care premiums</text>
  <text start="664.079" dur="4.68">are including this because this is part</text>
  <text start="665.79" dur="6.06">of consumer spending which makes up 71</text>
  <text start="668.759" dur="5.7">percent of GDP they revised numbers</text>
  <text start="671.85" dur="5.459">going backwards to bring this number up</text>
  <text start="674.459" dur="6.11">and this is what they do very often they</text>
  <text start="677.309" dur="6.78">do these type of things to completely</text>
  <text start="680.569" dur="4.781">make it look like the economy is</text>
  <text start="684.089" dur="5.761">improving but we could see throughout</text>
  <text start="685.35" dur="6.599">2016 GDP is that one point six percent</text>
  <text start="689.85" dur="5.519">which is actually awful and it is a</text>
  <text start="691.949" dur="6.031">manipulated number which means that this</text>
