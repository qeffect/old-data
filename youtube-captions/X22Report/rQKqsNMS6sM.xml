  <text start="102.18" dur="4.98">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="3.5">when we think of the economy not just</text>
  <text start="107.16" dur="3.51">here in the United States but globally</text>
  <text start="108.229" dur="5.171">we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="4.949">important this economy that were in it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.4" dur="5.31">not a people&amp;#39;s economy this was designed</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="5.221">by the central bank and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="4.56">reason to keep this economy going</text>
  <text start="120.84" dur="5.97">there&amp;#39;s no reason to repair it which it</text>
  <text start="123.27" dur="7.019">can&amp;#39;t but the whole purpose of what</text>
  <text start="126.81" dur="6.33">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is to get rid of</text>
  <text start="130.289" dur="6.801">the central bankers economy and the only</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="8.07">way to do that is to destroy it and</text>
  <text start="137.09" dur="5.5">create an economy without the central</text>
  <text start="141.21" dur="6.9">bank behind it because well the central</text>
  <text start="142.59" dur="7.95">bank does is loan the people currency</text>
  <text start="148.11" dur="5.01">with interest attached and where do they</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="5.25">get it out of thin air they push a</text>
  <text start="153.12" dur="5.79">button that&amp;#39;s it they do absolutely</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="5.43">nothing else they don&amp;#39;t balance</text>
  <text start="158.91" dur="5.28">everything they don&amp;#39;t keep the economy</text>
  <text start="161.22" dur="5.07">going if that is true we wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="164.19" dur="5.1">all these crashes they be able to</text>
  <text start="166.29" dur="5.19">forecast a recession there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="169.29" dur="5.52">to have a central bank we were tricked</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="5.37">into accepting them and this has</text>
  <text start="174.81" dur="5.66">happened many many times before there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.85" dur="6.09">no reason why we need an outside</text>
  <text start="180.47" dur="6.31">corporation which is not part of the</text>
  <text start="182.94" dur="5.88">people to loan us currency</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="7.11">they&amp;#39;re just creating it out of thin air</text>
  <text start="188.82" dur="6.51">it makes no sense whatsoever so keep</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="4.02">that in mind when we talk about the</text>
  <text start="195.33" dur="8.31">economy and remember they know their</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="6.21">design only lasts 40 to 45 years at the</text>
  <text start="203.64" dur="2.31">most</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="3.75">maybe they can keep it going a little</text>
  <text start="205.95" dur="4.02">bit longer but eventually what happens</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="4.26">it all breaks down and remember we</text>
  <text start="209.97" dur="7.23">started this new system back in the 70s</text>
  <text start="212.13" dur="10.44">1971 it is now 2018 and here we are at</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="8.13">what 47 years or so so we&amp;#39;re at that</text>
  <text start="222.57" dur="6.57">point where this entire thing is going</text>
  <text start="225.33" dur="5.22">to completely break down and implode now</text>
  <text start="229.14" dur="4.02">they thought this was gonna happen a</text>
  <text start="230.55" dur="4.08">while ago they were preparing for it and</text>
  <text start="233.16" dur="2.94">they were going to use an event we</text>
  <text start="234.63" dur="4.8">talked about this many many times before</text>
  <text start="236.1" dur="8.73">and we need to understand that it is</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="7.83">impossible for this entire system to pay</text>
  <text start="244.83" dur="5.879">down the debt to zero because think</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="5.46">about it in the very early stages when</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="4.651">they created the central bank and they</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="5.759">made that first dollar loan to the</text>
  <text start="255.36" dur="6.689">government the government owed what $1</text>
  <text start="258.479" dur="7.621">25 where do you get the 25 cents it</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="6.901">doesn&amp;#39;t exist they can&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="266.1" dur="6.6">except borrow more so there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="268.95" dur="6.09">gonna be more owed than dollars that are</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="5.46">out there it&amp;#39;s completely impossible to</text>
  <text start="275.04" dur="5.879">pay this down so when we look at this</text>
  <text start="278.16" dur="5.97">economy we can see that it was meant and</text>
  <text start="280.919" dur="5.341">it was designed to break apart after a</text>
  <text start="284.13" dur="5.789">certain period of time because it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="286.26" dur="7.98">built to create a thriving economy where</text>
  <text start="289.919" dur="7.621">the people flourish it was created to</text>
  <text start="294.24" dur="6">make the upper echelon very very wealthy</text>
  <text start="297.54" dur="6.42">to allow the central bank to keep</text>
  <text start="300.24" dur="5.31">control over everything that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="303.96" dur="3.45">was really designed for and they just</text>
  <text start="305.55" dur="4.2">keep restarting it I mean after World</text>
  <text start="307.41" dur="6.48">War two we went on to the central bank</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="6.45">system Bretton Woods 1971 petrodollar</text>
  <text start="313.89" dur="4.62">system and now they want to bring us to</text>
  <text start="316.2" dur="3.91">the next system this has been the plan</text>
  <text start="318.51" dur="4.27">for a very long time</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="5.34">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that retail</text>
  <text start="322.78" dur="4.2">stores they have completely imploded on</text>
  <text start="325.45" dur="3.33">themselves now a lot of people say well</text>
  <text start="326.98" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s online sales everything&amp;#39;s moving to</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="5.22">online sales but we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="330.82" dur="6.78">signs that online sales well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334" dur="5.94">starting to slow best buy report it a</text>
  <text start="337.6" dur="5.07">drop in quarterly online sales growth</text>
  <text start="339.94" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re afraid that online sales have</text>
  <text start="342.67" dur="5.4">hit a peak at this time eventually</text>
  <text start="345.1" dur="4.5">everything will hit a peak and what</text>
  <text start="348.07" dur="4.56">happens is all these stores they have</text>
  <text start="349.6" dur="4.23">online presence and it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="352.63" dur="2.13">everyone&amp;#39;s saying hey you know something</text>
  <text start="353.83" dur="2.22">I&amp;#39;m not going to shop in the brick and</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="3.3">mortar I&amp;#39;m gonna go to their online</text>
  <text start="356.05" dur="4.14">store and buy there everyone is not</text>
  <text start="358.06" dur="5.49">running to Amazon to purchase everything</text>
  <text start="360.19" dur="6.66">from Amazon this is a trillion dollar</text>
  <text start="363.55" dur="5.76">industry and it&amp;#39;s not a 1:1 ratio where</text>
  <text start="366.85" dur="4.91">everything is moving to online so what</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that Best Buy</text>
  <text start="371.76" dur="5.5">said in a statement that domestic online</text>
  <text start="374.53" dur="5.01">sales rose 10.1 percent in its second</text>
  <text start="377.26" dur="5.76">quarter ending August 1st that compares</text>
  <text start="379.54" dur="4.89">with 12% in the first quarter and what</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re seeing is that people are</text>
  <text start="384.43" dur="5.04">starting to move away from online and</text>
  <text start="387.25" dur="5.19">from brick-and-mortar at the same time</text>
  <text start="389.47" dur="6.06">because what happens when an economy</text>
  <text start="392.44" dur="5.1">breaks down well your extra spending</text>
  <text start="395.53" dur="3.72">money completely disappears because you</text>
  <text start="397.54" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t have that high paying job you have</text>
  <text start="399.25" dur="3.6">a part-time job a lot of people are out</text>
  <text start="401.35" dur="4.29">of the market right now because they</text>
  <text start="402.85" dur="4.71">can&amp;#39;t find work this has been going on</text>
  <text start="405.64" dur="3.54">for a very long time and all they do is</text>
  <text start="407.56" dur="3.75">manipulate the numbers to make you think</text>
  <text start="409.18" dur="4.34">that everything is fantastic if you look</text>
  <text start="411.31" dur="5.31">at home sales right now we know that</text>
  <text start="413.52" dur="4.96">existing new home sales they have</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="3.9">declined we see mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="418.48" dur="4.98">they are dropping and now pending home</text>
  <text start="420.52" dur="5.91">sales they missed expectations dropping</text>
  <text start="423.46" dur="5.45">0.7% month on month so now we have</text>
  <text start="426.43" dur="6.57">existing new home and pending sales all</text>
  <text start="428.91" dur="7.15">falling now pending home sales they have</text>
  <text start="433" dur="5.7">declined for the seventh straight month</text>
  <text start="436.06" dur="6.66">in a row now think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.7" dur="5.82">happening here we have all these</text>
  <text start="442.72" dur="3.78">different indicators telling us that</text>
  <text start="444.52" dur="3.84">home sales are declining now this is</text>
  <text start="446.5" dur="3.96">during a period where home sales are</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="4.26">supposed to be very very strong this is</text>
  <text start="450.46" dur="3.55">the spring summer months we are heading</text>
  <text start="452.62" dur="3.4">into the fall</text>
  <text start="454.01" dur="4.98">winter months where real estate starts</text>
  <text start="456.02" dur="4.77">to slow now in September the Fed is</text>
  <text start="458.99" dur="4.38">looking to raise interest rates once</text>
  <text start="460.79" dur="4.74">again if they do this guess what&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="4.35">happen to mortgage applications guess</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="4.92">what&amp;#39;s going to happen to new home</text>
  <text start="467.72" dur="6.3">existing home pending home sales they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="6.45">all going to decline further and if we</text>
  <text start="474.02" dur="4.85">look at the sentiment for home buying we</text>
  <text start="476.9" dur="6.36">see that it&amp;#39;s the worst since Lehman</text>
  <text start="478.87" dur="7.44">this is not going to improve and what is</text>
  <text start="483.26" dur="6.27">happening here is this economy is</text>
  <text start="486.31" dur="4.14">imploding on itself now while all this</text>
  <text start="489.53" dur="4.53">is happening</text>
  <text start="490.45" dur="5.71">Trump is pushing that this economy is</text>
  <text start="494.06" dur="4.83">the best economy we&amp;#39;ve ever seen in our</text>
  <text start="496.16" dur="5.88">lifetime actually right now the second</text>
  <text start="498.89" dur="6.36">quarter GDP revised higher now 24.2%</text>
  <text start="502.04" dur="6.06">strongest in four years this is all</text>
  <text start="505.25" dur="4.23">being done on purpose yes we have the</text>
  <text start="508.1" dur="4.08">same debt load actually we have more</text>
  <text start="509.48" dur="4.13">debt now the unemployment numbers yes</text>
  <text start="512.18" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re manipulated just like they were</text>
  <text start="513.61" dur="7.239">when Obama wasn&amp;#39;t in his term the GDP</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="5.01">numbers completely manipulated and</text>
  <text start="520.849" dur="3.931">shifted to make GDP numbers move up very</text>
  <text start="524.06" dur="4.17">very quickly</text>
  <text start="524.78" dur="5.88">retail still declining online sales</text>
  <text start="528.23" dur="4.56">starting to decline automobile</text>
  <text start="530.66" dur="3.66">manufacturing declining a lot of the</text>
  <text start="532.79" dur="3.63">data they&amp;#39;re not even reporting anymore</text>
  <text start="534.32" dur="4.41">yes there&amp;#39;s still channel stuffing and</text>
  <text start="536.42" dur="5.55">we can see that everything is</text>
  <text start="538.73" dur="6.81">continually moving the same way it was</text>
  <text start="541.97" dur="5.73">they really didn&amp;#39;t change much the only</text>
  <text start="545.54" dur="4.44">thing that they are changing is how</text>
  <text start="547.7" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re going to prepare this system for</text>
  <text start="549.98" dur="3.6">when we get out of the central banking</text>
  <text start="551.36" dur="4.29">economy you have to destroy the</text>
  <text start="553.58" dur="3.72">globalist trade deals you have to</text>
  <text start="555.65" dur="4.8">destroy whatever the central bank has</text>
  <text start="557.3" dur="6.54">set up and this takes some time and you</text>
  <text start="560.45" dur="5.21">can see already that it is working we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="563.84" dur="3.09">getting bilateral trade agreements</text>
  <text start="565.66" dur="3.07">companies</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="4.59">I mean countries are coming into the</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="5.49">fold Mexico and now we hear Justin</text>
  <text start="571.52" dur="6.54">Trudeau says that NAFTA deal with the US</text>
  <text start="574.22" dur="5.49">might be possible by Friday and we see</text>
  <text start="578.06" dur="4.23">that there are a lot of other countries</text>
  <text start="579.71" dur="4.47">out there that are looking to make</text>
  <text start="582.29" dur="3.87">bilateral trade agreements with the</text>
  <text start="584.18" dur="3.3">United States and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.16" dur="5.419">going to happen the world trade</text>
  <text start="587.48" dur="6.81">organization and the globalist plans</text>
  <text start="591.579" dur="5.5">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna push them aside we see</text>
  <text start="594.29" dur="4.65">Makran has already said that times are</text>
  <text start="597.079" dur="4.921">changing everything is shifting the</text>
  <text start="598.94" dur="6.209">people are realizing that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="602" dur="5.85">snowed all this time and it is time to</text>
  <text start="605.149" dur="4.731">get out of this central bank economy</text>
  <text start="607.85" dur="4.349">this is what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="609.88" dur="5.199">every single step that is being taken</text>
  <text start="612.199" dur="6.591">right now is to move us away and out of</text>
  <text start="615.079" dur="6.481">this system into a brand new system</text>
  <text start="618.79" dur="4.27">something that has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="621.56" dur="5.13">the central bank because they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="623.06" dur="4.529">exist now if the central banks are so</text>
  <text start="626.69" dur="5.009">fantastic</text>
  <text start="627.589" dur="7.231">why do we see all of these countries in</text>
  <text start="631.699" dur="6.721">debt remember since 1913 we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="634.82" dur="7.44">brainwashed to think that debt is a good</text>
  <text start="638.42" dur="7.89">thing borrowing is a good thing</text>
  <text start="642.26" dur="6.3">interest is a good thing and if you look</text>
  <text start="646.31" dur="6.24">at just say the US economy right now</text>
  <text start="648.56" dur="5.73">what do we see we see everyone drowning</text>
  <text start="652.55" dur="6.029">in student loan debt who ever went to</text>
  <text start="654.29" dur="8.01">school everyone is drowning in a car</text>
  <text start="658.579" dur="7.021">loan either financed or lease if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="662.3" dur="5.67">leasing you never get rid of that loan</text>
  <text start="665.6" dur="5.299">you just keep rolling it over to the</text>
  <text start="667.97" dur="6.119">next car you&amp;#39;re in constant debt</text>
  <text start="670.899" dur="5.591">never-ending you see mortgages</text>
  <text start="674.089" dur="4.291">everyone&amp;#39;s drowning in mortgages</text>
  <text start="676.49" dur="6.06">everything there&amp;#39;s interest attached</text>
  <text start="678.38" dur="6.509">with everything the central bankers plan</text>
  <text start="682.55" dur="5.399">was to keep everyone in debt to keep</text>
  <text start="684.889" dur="7.68">countries in debt to keep control over</text>
  <text start="687.949" dur="7.19">them and this is how their system works</text>
  <text start="692.569" dur="5.941">because when the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="695.139" dur="6.401">decreases and you need more dollars to</text>
  <text start="698.51" dur="6.93">pay for that car to pay for that Apple</text>
  <text start="701.54" dur="9">to pay for that home and the wages don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="705.44" dur="7.079">keep up with the devaluing dollar you</text>
  <text start="710.54" dur="4.799">can&amp;#39;t afford anything and the only thing</text>
  <text start="712.519" dur="5.25">that you can do is take out loans just</text>
  <text start="715.339" dur="4.381">think back over time when you take a</text>
  <text start="717.769" dur="3.51">look at the entire economic system when</text>
  <text start="719.72" dur="3.239">you go back to 1913</text>
  <text start="721.279" dur="4.951">people didn&amp;#39;t need credit cards back</text>
  <text start="722.959" dur="6.56">then people were able to purchase their</text>
  <text start="726.23" dur="6.57">cars people were able to purchase their</text>
  <text start="729.519" dur="6.401">food with cash people were able to</text>
  <text start="732.8" dur="6.42">purchase everything as time went on and</text>
  <text start="735.92" dur="5.07">the value of the dollar decreased you we</text>
  <text start="739.22" dur="4.14">needed more and more credit now</text>
  <text start="740.99" dur="4.5">fast-forward to 1970 when we came off</text>
  <text start="743.36" dur="5.49">the gold standard think about what</text>
  <text start="745.49" dur="5.55">happened at that point where all of a</text>
  <text start="748.85" dur="4.82">sudden now there&amp;#39;s no checks and</text>
  <text start="751.04" dur="6.149">balances were off the gold standard the</text>
  <text start="753.67" dur="7.12">central bank can create currency by</text>
  <text start="757.189" dur="6.291">pushing a button and the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="760.79" dur="5.489">are able to borrow as much as they want</text>
  <text start="763.48" dur="5.529">well that value of that dollar decreases</text>
  <text start="766.279" dur="5.071">if it decreases you need a lot more of</text>
  <text start="769.009" dur="4.62">them to pay for that item now in the</text>
  <text start="771.35" dur="4.56">beginning stages in 1970 you really</text>
  <text start="773.629" dur="4.741">don&amp;#39;t notice it you don&amp;#39;t notice</text>
  <text start="775.91" dur="4.289">anything you don&amp;#39;t really feel it as of</text>
  <text start="778.37" dur="3.389">yet the 80s they haven&amp;#39;t dropped the</text>
  <text start="780.199" dur="4.05">interest rates which we saw happen</text>
  <text start="781.759" dur="5.18">everything started to even out and all</text>
  <text start="784.249" dur="5.251">of a sudden we saw the credit boom</text>
  <text start="786.939" dur="5.83">people taking out more loans to do</text>
  <text start="789.5" dur="6.12">things borrowing because they told us it</text>
  <text start="792.769" dur="6.841">was a good thing as we were moving into</text>
  <text start="795.62" dur="6.06">the 90s and 2000 we saw that inflation</text>
  <text start="799.61" dur="5.699">was hitting everything was costing a lot</text>
  <text start="801.68" dur="7.889">more homes uh prices on homes moved up</text>
  <text start="805.309" dur="7.111">college tuition moved up food was</text>
  <text start="809.569" dur="4.921">continually moving up and yes they</text>
  <text start="812.42" dur="3.81">played tricks on us where they changed</text>
  <text start="814.49" dur="3.86">the packaging where they made the</text>
  <text start="816.23" dur="4.859">packages smaller kept the price the same</text>
  <text start="818.35" dur="4.45">swapped out different food items that</text>
  <text start="821.089" dur="3.84">made you think that it was the same</text>
  <text start="822.8" dur="4.529">exact food item they started adding</text>
  <text start="824.929" dur="5.191">chemicals to the foods to make you think</text>
  <text start="827.329" dur="5.01">that oh this is what this is the same</text>
  <text start="830.12" dur="4.559">exact food but it was really replacing</text>
  <text start="832.339" dur="4.261">the more expensive real food with the</text>
  <text start="834.679" dur="3.78">fake chemical foods they did all these</text>
  <text start="836.6" dur="3.659">tricks now we&amp;#39;re at the point where the</text>
  <text start="838.459" dur="4.32">value of the dollar is continually</text>
  <text start="840.259" dur="4.711">decreasing and over this period of time</text>
  <text start="842.779" dur="4.53">we saw that we couldn&amp;#39;t afford anything</text>
  <text start="844.97" dur="4.53">I can&amp;#39;t go out and purchase a car yes it</text>
  <text start="847.309" dur="5.4">first started out I had to finance it</text>
  <text start="849.5" dur="5.52">maybe for 36 months then we moved to 48</text>
  <text start="852.709" dur="4.621">months then we moved to 60 months now</text>
  <text start="855.02" dur="4.41">two months now people can&amp;#39;t even finance</text>
  <text start="857.33" dur="4.59">that and we had to move to leasing to</text>
  <text start="859.43" dur="5.34">rent your automobile which will keep you</text>
  <text start="861.92" dur="6.06">constantly in debt because the leased</text>
  <text start="864.77" dur="5.88">just never ends because the value of the</text>
  <text start="867.98" dur="5.46">dollar decreases mortgages they have</text>
  <text start="870.65" dur="6.36">gone past 30 years because people</text>
  <text start="873.44" dur="6.06">couldn&amp;#39;t afford the homes and the value</text>
  <text start="877.01" dur="5.28">of the homes they kept on rising and</text>
  <text start="879.5" dur="6.21">that&amp;#39;s because the dollar value kept on</text>
  <text start="882.29" dur="5.19">falling same thing with college tuition</text>
  <text start="885.71" dur="6.57">so you had to take more and more out</text>
  <text start="887.48" dur="6.72">there system is designed not to make you</text>
  <text start="892.28" dur="5.61">wealthier but it&amp;#39;s designed to make you</text>
  <text start="894.2" dur="6.12">poor those individuals in the beginning</text>
  <text start="897.89" dur="4.26">stages well they had an easier time</text>
  <text start="900.32" dur="3.45">those people that are in it now are</text>
  <text start="902.15" dur="4.26">having a little bit more difficult time</text>
  <text start="903.77" dur="5.1">and yes there are certain people that</text>
  <text start="906.41" dur="5.04">get around the system they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="908.87" dur="6.36">make a lot more money but remember they</text>
  <text start="911.45" dur="6.33">wanted to keep the masses down and if</text>
  <text start="915.23" dur="4.23">you look there are a lot more well</text>
  <text start="917.78" dur="3.66">there&amp;#39;s hardly any middle class but a</text>
  <text start="919.46" dur="3.3">lot more poorer middle class then there</text>
  <text start="921.44" dur="4.95">are wealthier that&amp;#39;s why they call them</text>
  <text start="922.76" dur="6.63">the 1% so you can see how their system</text>
  <text start="926.39" dur="5.49">was completely designed in this way we</text>
  <text start="929.39" dur="3.99">need to move away from the system and</text>
  <text start="931.88" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s what this is all about this is</text>
  <text start="933.38" dur="4.77">the entire plan it&amp;#39;s to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="936.29" dur="4.8">central bank it&amp;#39;s got to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="938.15" dur="5.52">deep state and that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="941.09" dur="5.94">transition now into something completely</text>
  <text start="943.67" dur="5.19">different separate and apart from the</text>
  <text start="947.03" dur="3.33">central banking system</text>
