  <text start="235.12" dur="5.61">americans default on their student loans</text>
  <text start="237.16" dur="5.85">so as you can see the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.73" dur="4.95">plan the deep state plan it has worked</text>
  <text start="243.01" dur="6.36">throughout this period of time and what</text>
  <text start="245.68" dur="5.429">we&amp;#39;re seeing is a reversal of everything</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="3.899">that they&amp;#39;ve done over the many many</text>
  <text start="251.109" dur="6.18">years and we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="253.269" dur="6.241">dismantled piece by piece already as we</text>
  <text start="257.289" dur="4.471">can see Trump was out there and he was</text>
  <text start="259.51" dur="4.17">talking about Amazon and the post office</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="4.92">and you know nobody could figure it out</text>
  <text start="263.68" dur="5.7">like how does Amazon how do they have</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="5.34">the ability to ship for like almost</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="3.9">nothing with all this free shipping and</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="3.99">things like that</text>
  <text start="273.28" dur="5.639">el turns out that the post office and</text>
  <text start="276.01" dur="5.46">Amazon they made a terrible deal good</text>
  <text start="278.919" dur="6.451">for Amazon bad for the post office bad</text>
  <text start="281.47" dur="6.03">for the taxpayers and right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.37" dur="4.2">looking into this but the Senate they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="287.5" dur="4.56">delayed a hearing on the US Postal</text>
  <text start="289.57" dur="6.06">Service reform and they&amp;#39;re postponing</text>
  <text start="292.06" dur="5.94">Trump&amp;#39;s fight against Amazon now the</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="4.2">hearing could have scrutinized what</text>
  <text start="298" dur="3.93">Amazon and others pay for package</text>
  <text start="299.83" dur="4.68">delivery which Trump says is the cause</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="6.63">for the US Postal Service 65 billion</text>
  <text start="304.51" dur="7.89">loss since 2009 so he ordered a task</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="5.669">force on in the month of April to study</text>
  <text start="312.4" dur="3.54">the Postal Service to look at its</text>
  <text start="314.229" dur="4.021">financial health and what it charges</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="3.3">customers such as Amazon for package</text>
  <text start="318.25" dur="3.24">delivery</text>
  <text start="319.24" dur="4.23">and they haven&amp;#39;t released a report yet</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="4.41">but the Senate already cancelled it and</text>
  <text start="323.47" dur="3.06">the task force is continuing their work</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="2.73">right now</text>
  <text start="326.53" dur="4.889">so what we&amp;#39;re going to see is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.63" dur="5.189">going to see each and every piece looked</text>
  <text start="331.419" dur="4.861">at and scrutinized because we need to</text>
  <text start="333.819" dur="5.85">understand the central bank the deep</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="5.34">state when they pass laws it wasn&amp;#39;t to</text>
  <text start="339.669" dur="4.261">benefit the American people even though</text>
  <text start="341.62" dur="3.99">they put the titles up there where it</text>
  <text start="343.93" dur="3.93">looked like it was going to benefit the</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="4.709">people like the Affordable Care Act like</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="5.91">the Patriot Act and all the other acts</text>
  <text start="350.319" dur="5.311">the title sound great but when you start</text>
  <text start="353.77" dur="4.019">reading them and you really understand</text>
  <text start="355.63" dur="3.539">what they&amp;#39;re actually doing it is not</text>
  <text start="357.789" dur="3.87">great for the American people it&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="359.169" dur="4.081">for other corporations it&amp;#39;s great for</text>
  <text start="361.659" dur="3.54">them to put more money into their</text>
  <text start="363.25" dur="5.659">pockets it&amp;#39;s great for the central bank</text>
  <text start="365.199" dur="8.911">but not for the everyday person and</text>
  <text start="368.909" dur="7.54">Trump tweeted back in December 29th 2017</text>
  <text start="374.11" dur="4.44">why is the United States Post Office</text>
  <text start="376.449" dur="4.861">which is losing many billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="378.55" dur="5.07">a year while charging Amazon and others</text>
  <text start="381.31" dur="5.43">so little to deliver their packages</text>
  <text start="383.62" dur="6.389">making Amazon richer and the post office</text>
  <text start="386.74" dur="7.799">dumber and poor should be charging much</text>
  <text start="390.009" dur="7.171">more and then on March 29 2018 he</text>
  <text start="394.539" dur="5.16">tweeted I have stated my concerns with</text>
  <text start="397.18" dur="5.16">Amazon long before the election unlike</text>
  <text start="399.699" dur="4.681">others they pay little or no taxes to</text>
  <text start="402.34" dur="4.98">state or local governments use our</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="5.189">postal service as their delivery boy</text>
  <text start="407.32" dur="5.01">causing tremendous loss to the US and</text>
  <text start="409.569" dur="7.65">putting many thousands of retailers out</text>
  <text start="412.33" dur="7.88">of business so we can see that each part</text>
  <text start="417.219" dur="6.811">of what has been going on is going to be</text>
  <text start="420.21" dur="6.13">reversed and we&amp;#39;re already starting to</text>
  <text start="424.03" dur="3.66">see this TPP was very easy all you had</text>
  <text start="426.34" dur="3.78">to do is say no we&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="427.69" dur="4.02">doing this nafta&amp;#39;s being renegotiated on</text>
  <text start="430.12" dur="2.699">I believe this is just the beginning I</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="3.929">think they&amp;#39;re gonna have to renegotiate</text>
  <text start="432.819" dur="5.1">this even further down the line but this</text>
  <text start="435.639" dur="5.58">is all they can do at this point we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.919" dur="6.211">also going to see other things within</text>
  <text start="441.219" dur="6.541">the economy completely change the way</text>
  <text start="444.13" dur="5.13">the central bank operates we&amp;#39;re most</text>
  <text start="447.76" dur="4.29">likely it will be taken over by the</text>
  <text start="449.26" dur="3.42">people it will no longer be independent</text>
  <text start="452.05" dur="4.38">it will no longer</text>
  <text start="452.68" dur="5.88">be a corporation and what is happening</text>
  <text start="456.43" dur="3.799">here throughout not just here in the</text>
  <text start="458.56" dur="5.579">United States but throughout the world</text>
  <text start="460.229" dur="7.271">they&amp;#39;re changing it up and the Trump</text>
  <text start="464.139" dur="5.731">doctrine is easiest described as</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="6.27">deploying economic leverage to achieve</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="5.579">national security interests and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.77" dur="4.29">happening here not just here in the</text>
  <text start="475.449" dur="5.19">United States but in many different</text>
  <text start="478.06" dur="7.59">parts of the world everything is being</text>
  <text start="480.639" dur="10.011">changed and the EU the central bankers</text>
  <text start="485.65" dur="7.32">IMF is the Fed they don&amp;#39;t like it and</text>
  <text start="490.65" dur="5.049">right now they are completely changing</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="4.65">everything everything that we&amp;#39;ve seen in</text>
  <text start="495.699" dur="4.711">the past where they were giving a like</text>
  <text start="497.62" dur="5.13">to Pakistan well they&amp;#39;re removing the</text>
  <text start="500.41" dur="4.89">900 million to Pakistan the aid that was</text>
  <text start="502.75" dur="4.41">being given to Syria remember all this</text>
  <text start="505.3" dur="5.429">aid all these millions and billions of</text>
  <text start="507.16" dur="5.97">dollars it wasn&amp;#39;t really going to what</text>
  <text start="510.729" dur="4.23">they said it was going to it was going</text>
  <text start="513.13" dur="4.26">to other things to fund different</text>
  <text start="514.959" dur="4.351">operations and was always siphoned off</text>
  <text start="517.39" dur="2.97">this is why there was always these funds</text>
  <text start="519.31" dur="3.3">that were missing especially in</text>
  <text start="520.36" dur="5.12">Afghanistan billions and billions of</text>
  <text start="522.61" dur="5.7">dollars nobody knows where it went and</text>
  <text start="525.48" dur="8.22">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is that each</text>
  <text start="528.31" dur="8.58">part is being cut off to allow us to</text>
  <text start="533.7" dur="5.77">transition into this new economic system</text>
  <text start="536.89" dur="6.03">and you cannot continually spend like</text>
  <text start="539.47" dur="6.18">this and support these covert operations</text>
  <text start="542.92" dur="5.76">and funnel these funds into all these</text>
  <text start="545.65" dur="5.1">different operations when we&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="548.68" dur="4.44">into a brand new economic system it just</text>
  <text start="550.75" dur="3.57">won&amp;#39;t work so everything the deep state</text>
  <text start="553.12" dur="3.12">the central banks have been doing</text>
  <text start="554.32" dur="4.17">everything is being rolled back right</text>
  <text start="556.24" dur="4.68">now and we know that the economy is then</text>

  <text start="560.92" dur="4.71">United States but globally it&amp;#39;s just one</text>
  <text start="562.63" dur="5.1">gigantic bubble and it&amp;#39;s been built up</text>
  <text start="565.63" dur="3.78">built up because this is the only way</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="4.53">they were able to fund everything is to</text>
  <text start="569.41" dur="7.58">prop everything up and inflate the</text>
  <text start="572.26" dur="7.05">bubble as big as they possibly could now</text>
  <text start="576.99" dur="4.78">when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="579.31" dur="5.46">these bubbles are eventually going to</text>
  <text start="581.77" dur="4.319">pop that means the system is going to</text>
  <text start="584.77" dur="2.58">collapse</text>

  <text start="587.35" dur="5.989">closer look at these bubbles we can see</text>
  <text start="589.839" dur="7.201">once these bubbles do pop well we&amp;#39;re in</text>
