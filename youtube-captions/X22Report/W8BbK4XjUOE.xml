  <text start="196.28" dur="4.26">something if you&amp;#39;re not going to do what</text>
  <text start="198.23" dur="5.58">we want then we&amp;#39;re gonna turn someplace</text>

  <text start="203.81" dur="6.57">be winning this time now here in the</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="6.75">United States we are seeing the central</text>
  <text start="210.38" dur="5.25">bank system completely implode this is</text>
  <text start="213.53" dur="7.8">why Trump is out there saying listen we</text>
  <text start="215.63" dur="7.38">need stimulus we need a rate cut now</text>
  <text start="221.33" dur="5.28">he&amp;#39;s doing this on purpose because he</text>
  <text start="223.01" dur="5.91">knows when you do this it pumps up the</text>
  <text start="226.61" dur="4.349">statistical numbers it pumps up the</text>
  <text start="228.92" dur="4.65">stock market it pumps up GDP it pumps up</text>
  <text start="230.959" dur="5.4">pretty much everything and it gives</text>
  <text start="233.57" dur="5.4">banks and investors free money to dabble</text>
  <text start="236.359" dur="5.821">in and speculate in the market remember</text>
  <text start="238.97" dur="5.25">he&amp;#39;s using all the tools against the</text>
  <text start="242.18" dur="4.74">deep state the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="244.22" dur="4.739">mainstream media and there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="246.92" dur="5.22">they can do about it and I do believe</text>
  <text start="248.959" dur="4.771">that he&amp;#39;s pretty much controlling what</text>
  <text start="252.14" dur="4.5">the Fed is going to do next because</text>
  <text start="253.73" dur="5.249">remember he has turned the economy</text>
  <text start="256.64" dur="6.75">around of course statistically speaking</text>
  <text start="258.979" dur="7.021">and the mainstream media the deep state</text>
  <text start="263.39" dur="5.52">the central banks they can&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="266" dur="5.55">about it and all he continually says and</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="7.05">all anyone can see is that the economy</text>
  <text start="271.55" dur="6.96">is doing absolutely wonderful think</text>
  <text start="275.96" dur="4.41">about going back many many years the</text>
  <text start="278.51" dur="3.96">mainstream media the central banks have</text>
  <text start="280.37" dur="4.23">been brainwashing lessons and thinking</text>
  <text start="282.47" dur="4.199">that the stock market the GDP and the</text>
  <text start="284.6" dur="5.25">unemployment numbers this is what makes</text>
  <text start="286.669" dur="6.241">up the economy now they can&amp;#39;t backtrack</text>
  <text start="289.85" dur="3.66">on this because it makes them look like</text>
  <text start="292.91" dur="2.879">idiots</text>
  <text start="293.51" dur="5.82">so they have to go along with and he</text>
  <text start="295.789" dur="6.151">knows this and he&amp;#39;s trapped them all</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="5.7">but what&amp;#39;s happening the central bank</text>
  <text start="301.94" dur="6.479">system that the central bank&amp;#39;s setup is</text>
  <text start="305.03" dur="5.819">collapsing retail sales in the United</text>
  <text start="308.419" dur="5.011">States will they fell in April and the</text>
  <text start="310.849" dur="5.85">falling sales hit most major areas of</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="5.519">retail including online sales autos home</text>
  <text start="316.699" dur="4.771">garden centers clothing shops pharmacies</text>
  <text start="318.949" dur="4.62">and electronic stores well there goes</text>
  <text start="321.47" dur="3.509">that argument that everything is</text>
  <text start="323.569" dur="3.69">switching from brick-and-mortar to</text>
  <text start="324.979" dur="6.12">online sales that is thrown out the</text>
  <text start="327.259" dur="7.59">window completely now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="331.099" dur="6.511">here is that the entire economic system</text>
  <text start="334.849" dur="5.701">the people the everyday person who is</text>
  <text start="337.61" dur="4.98">working yes they might be feeling better</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="4.26">yes they might be hearing the news that</text>
  <text start="342.59" dur="3.96">jobs are coming back yes they might be</text>
  <text start="344.81" dur="4.289">looking up the stock market and looking</text>
  <text start="346.55" dur="4.799">at the unemployment numbers but if</text>
  <text start="349.099" dur="4.201">you&amp;#39;re not getting a raise if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="351.349" dur="4.35">getting a better job you&amp;#39;re exactly</text>
  <text start="353.3" dur="5.369">where you were I mean there&amp;#39;s hope out</text>
  <text start="355.699" dur="5.301">there but you&amp;#39;re exactly where you are</text>
  <text start="358.669" dur="4.47">nothing&amp;#39;s really changed in your life</text>
  <text start="361" dur="4.99">you&amp;#39;re not gonna all of a sudden go out</text>
  <text start="363.139" dur="5.161">and spend all this money and this is</text>
  <text start="365.99" dur="5.579">what&amp;#39;s happening right now Trump</text>
  <text start="368.3" dur="6.45">understands that we only have a specific</text>
  <text start="371.569" dur="5.91">time period and he needs to hold</text>
  <text start="374.75" dur="6.21">together the entire economic system for</text>
  <text start="377.479" dur="6.09">this specific time period and this is</text>
  <text start="380.96" dur="5.04">the elections of course because he wants</text>
  <text start="383.569" dur="5.31">to do the next phase of the plan and</text>
  <text start="386" dur="4.74">that is to go after the central bank</text>
  <text start="388.879" dur="5.25">system and to blame the central bank</text>
  <text start="390.74" dur="6.479">system and when we look at trucking and</text>
  <text start="394.129" dur="5.701">rail shipments well those are declining</text>
  <text start="397.219" dur="5.491">and this is summarized by the CASP</text>
  <text start="399.83" dur="4.199">Freight index freight shipment volume in</text>
  <text start="402.71" dur="4.199">the US across all modes of</text>
  <text start="404.029" dur="7.911">transportation by truck rail air and</text>
  <text start="406.909" dur="8.281">barge it fell 3.2 percent in April</text>
  <text start="411.94" dur="4.589">compared to April of last year now this</text>
  <text start="415.19" dur="3.42">is the fifth month in a row</text>
  <text start="416.529" dur="4.42">year-over-year that we&amp;#39;re seeing these</text>
  <text start="418.61" dur="3.869">declines and the first batch of a client</text>
  <text start="420.949" dur="5.34">since the transportation recession of</text>
  <text start="422.479" dur="9.781">2015 and 2016 the last two times this</text>
  <text start="426.289" dur="8.941">has happened was in 2013 and 2009 now</text>
  <text start="432.26" dur="7.17">the system can be pumped up like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="435.23" dur="7.47">seen by the Fed reducing rates by the</text>
  <text start="439.43" dur="5.49">Fed pushing stimulus when Trump came</text>
  <text start="442.7" dur="5.76">into office what did we see</text>
  <text start="444.92" dur="5.6">we saw the Fed start to raise rates and</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="5.07">they start and they started to tighten</text>
  <text start="450.52" dur="5.86">what happened to the economy it started</text>
  <text start="453.53" dur="4.74">to decline and I&amp;#39;m talking about housing</text>
  <text start="456.38" dur="5.7">I&amp;#39;m talking about auto sales I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="458.27" dur="6.06">about the freight with rail and trucking</text>
  <text start="462.08" dur="6.63">and retail sales and all those different</text>
  <text start="464.33" dur="7.83">types of things now the Fed is in a</text>
  <text start="468.71" dur="7.32">holding pattern Trump wants them to</text>
  <text start="472.16" dur="5.28">reverse this to pump up the economy once</text>
  <text start="476.03" dur="3.36">again it&amp;#39;s like giving the economy some</text>
  <text start="477.44" dur="4.17">more of it of the drugs they were the</text>
  <text start="479.39" dur="4.89">economy was getting and this is what he</text>
  <text start="481.61" dur="7.08">wants to happen right now and the Fed</text>
  <text start="484.28" dur="7.77">well they&amp;#39;re going to listen he needs to</text>
  <text start="488.69" dur="6.03">do this because he sees the real data he</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="4.32">sees that industrial production it is</text>
  <text start="494.72" dur="4.53">tumbling once again it&amp;#39;s the weakest</text>
  <text start="496.37" dur="5.07">growth in two years but again this is</text>
  <text start="499.25" dur="5.07">not what the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="501.44" dur="4.29">central bank the deep state this is not</text>
  <text start="504.32" dur="3.27">what they&amp;#39;ve been reporting on for many</text>
  <text start="505.73" dur="5.01">many years when you mention industrial</text>
  <text start="507.59" dur="4.59">production manufacturing people are</text>
  <text start="510.74" dur="3.179">gonna be like okay but look at the stock</text>
  <text start="512.18" dur="3.54">market it&amp;#39;s going up again look at</text>
  <text start="513.919" dur="4.831">unemployment it&amp;#39;s really really low look</text>
  <text start="515.72" dur="4.32">at GDP that looks fantastic and people</text>
  <text start="518.75" dur="6.36">are not used to hearing these other</text>
  <text start="520.04" dur="8.6">things but Trump is now making the case</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="6.03">of why the Fed needs to do this listen I</text>
  <text start="528.64" dur="6.28">pumped up these numbers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.14" dur="6.81">fantastic what you&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="534.92" dur="8.61">actually not helping us it is hurting us</text>
  <text start="537.95" dur="8.49">and Trump has the upper hand why because</text>
  <text start="543.53" dur="6.45">Trump&amp;#39;s approval rating right now is at</text>
  <text start="546.44" dur="6.93">an all-time high of 51 percent he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.98" dur="6.99">actually winning Millennials over to his</text>
  <text start="553.37" dur="6.63">side and they trust him more than</text>
  <text start="556.97" dur="6.54">anything else so Trump crossed the</text>
  <text start="560" dur="4.65">critical 50% approval line needed to win</text>
  <text start="563.51" dur="2.97">a reelection</text>
  <text start="564.65" dur="5.489">and we see millennial</text>
  <text start="566.48" dur="6.33">independence they&amp;#39;re all embracing what</text>
  <text start="570.139" dur="6.63">he&amp;#39;s saying because he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="572.81" dur="7.5">saying that the economy is fantastic its</text>
  <text start="576.769" dur="5.82">booming it&amp;#39;s better than ever and what</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="6.029">is the Fed going to do are they going to</text>
  <text start="582.589" dur="6.24">tighten are they going to raise rates no</text>
  <text start="586.339" dur="4.8">because all eyes are on them so they</text>
  <text start="588.829" dur="5.161">have to do what Trump wants them to do</text>
  <text start="591.139" dur="4.89">and this is why we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="593.99" dur="5.43">articles out of the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="596.029" dur="6.661">saying Trump could get his Fred Fed rate</text>
  <text start="599.42" dur="6.75">cut after all but they had to add on but</text>
  <text start="602.69" dur="4.949">not for the right reasons and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.17" dur="3.87">very interesting remembered Trump</text>
  <text start="607.639" dur="4.111">tweeted out the following China will be</text>
  <text start="610.04" dur="4.14">pumping money into their system and</text>
  <text start="611.75" dur="4.44">probably reducing interest rates as</text>
  <text start="614.18" dur="4.349">always in order to make up for the</text>
  <text start="616.19" dur="4.74">business they are and will be losing if</text>
  <text start="618.529" dur="4.441">the federal reserve ever did a match it</text>
  <text start="620.93" dur="6.12">would be game over we win in any event</text>
  <text start="622.97" dur="7.859">China wants a deal he&amp;#39;s now out there</text>
  <text start="627.05" dur="6.599">telling the Fed exactly what he wants he</text>
  <text start="630.829" dur="5.25">has the upper hand he has the population</text>
  <text start="633.649" dur="4.5">behind him he&amp;#39;s showing everyone that he</text>
  <text start="636.079" dur="4.981">has made the economy fantastic remember</text>
  <text start="638.149" dur="5.19">we were coming off an economy where the</text>
  <text start="641.06" dur="3.839">mainstream media the central banks they</text>
  <text start="643.339" dur="4.171">were telling us this is the new normal</text>
  <text start="644.899" dur="4.651">that you got to get used to at GDP</text>
  <text start="647.51" dur="4.53">around 2% you got to get used to</text>
  <text start="649.55" dur="4.56">unemployment around this this this point</text>
  <text start="652.04" dur="4.609">you got to get used to the way growth is</text>
  <text start="654.11" dur="5.55">right now Trump came into office and</text>
  <text start="656.649" dur="6.341">basically blew all of that out of the</text>
  <text start="659.66" dur="6.419">water they can&amp;#39;t go back to that now</text>
  <text start="662.99" dur="5.099">because he just proved them wrong we</text>
  <text start="666.079" dur="4.461">don&amp;#39;t have to get used to this look what</text>
  <text start="668.089" dur="4.471">I&amp;#39;ve just done I&amp;#39;m waving the magic wand</text>
  <text start="670.54" dur="5.739">this is incredible</text>
  <text start="672.56" dur="6.6">and now we see the Fed out there saying</text>
  <text start="676.279" dur="6.18">yeah maybe we&amp;#39;ll be cutting rates</text>
  <text start="679.16" dur="6.419">because they know that if they raise</text>
  <text start="682.459" dur="6.031">rates or they tighten it&amp;#39;s all gonna</text>
  <text start="685.579" dur="5.361">come back to them so they&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="688.49" dur="6.029">to follow along what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="690.94" dur="7.629">which means the Patriots are in control</text>
  <text start="694.519" dur="5.591">they&amp;#39;re going to cut rates and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="698.569" dur="5.591">very interesting is</text>
  <text start="700.11" dur="6.03">the market has been pricing in an 80%</text>
  <text start="704.16" dur="5.43">chance and this is gonna go up that the</text>
  <text start="706.14" dur="8.28">Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis</text>
  <text start="709.59" dur="7.59">points in December of this year</text>

  <text start="720.74" dur="10.27">two rate cuts in the year 2020 now think</text>

  <text start="740.58" dur="7.02">maybe just once now we&amp;#39;re in a holding</text>
  <text start="743.55" dur="9.03">pattern now we&amp;#39;re gonna cut rates maybe</text>
  <text start="747.6" dur="6.86">once in 2019 and twice in 2020 now think</text>
  <text start="752.58" dur="4.77">about what trump was doing all this time</text>
  <text start="754.46" dur="6.58">he was telling them what he wants</text>
  <text start="757.35" dur="4.74">first he pumped the economy up and made</text>
  <text start="761.04" dur="4.47">it look better than ever</text>
  <text start="762.09" dur="6.9">got everybody on board everybody on his</text>
  <text start="765.51" dur="5.67">side they believe him now because look</text>

  <text start="771.18" dur="5.33">in the mainstream media told us that it</text>
  <text start="772.68" dur="5.91">would be impossible to do and he did it</text>
  <text start="776.51" dur="2.85">we know it&amp;#39;s manipulated but that</text>
  <text start="778.59" dur="5.88">doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="779.36" dur="7.33">the central bank now is the outlier the</text>
  <text start="784.47" dur="4.98">central bank now looks like they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="786.69" dur="5.31">know what they&amp;#39;re doing and they need to</text>
  <text start="789.45" dur="4.22">follow what Trump is doing now something</text>
  <text start="792" dur="5.34">very interesting the Kansas City Fed</text>
  <text start="793.67" dur="5.29">president Esther George said that she</text>
  <text start="797.34" dur="4.86">opposed to cutting interest rates in</text>
  <text start="798.96" dur="4.86">order to raise inflation well nobody</text>
  <text start="802.2" dur="3.84">said that this is what Trump wants to do</text>
  <text start="803.82" dur="4.02">he doesn&amp;#39;t want to raise inflation first</text>
  <text start="806.04" dur="3.9">of all the mandate for the Fed is to</text>
  <text start="807.84" dur="4.86">keep inflation at zero the mandate of</text>
  <text start="809.94" dur="7.8">the Fed is not to raise the inflation to</text>
  <text start="812.7" dur="8.97">2% she&amp;#39;s saying that if we cut interest</text>
  <text start="817.74" dur="6.3">rates this is going to create this could</text>
  <text start="821.67" dur="4.71">lead to asset price bubbles and</text>
  <text start="824.04" dur="5.43">ultimately an economic downturn</text>
  <text start="826.38" dur="5.28">she said that lower interest rates might</text>
  <text start="829.47" dur="4.41">fuel asset price bubbles create</text>
  <text start="831.66" dur="5.58">financial imbalances and alter</text>

  <text start="856.2" dur="6.45">and it inflates the bubbles this is what</text>
  <text start="859.41" dur="5.49">Trump wants think about it and think</text>
  <text start="862.65" dur="5.16">about what the Fed is saying if Trump</text>
  <text start="864.9" dur="6.27">has them cut rates and the bubbles get</text>
