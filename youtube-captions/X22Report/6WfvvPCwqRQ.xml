  <text start="60.949" dur="5.761">economy which will send precious metals</text>
  <text start="62.989" dur="6.571">sky-high let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="66.71" dur="4.62">collapse financial news now yesterday we</text>
  <text start="69.56" dur="2.94">talked about Venezuela and how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="71.33" dur="3.27">going to be selling their goal to get</text>
  <text start="72.5" dur="4.5">dollars because they are in a heap of</text>
  <text start="74.6" dur="4.53">trouble right now so General Motors</text>
  <text start="77" dur="4.679">right now is saying that the Venezuelan</text>
  <text start="79.13" dur="4.53">authorities well they illegally seized</text>
  <text start="81.679" dur="4.771">its plant in the industrial hub of</text>
  <text start="83.66" dur="4.2">Valencia and as a result the car maker</text>
  <text start="86.45" dur="4.14">said it would immediately halt</text>
  <text start="87.86" dur="4.98">operations in Venezuela and we can see</text>
  <text start="90.59" dur="5.79">that things are getting worse in</text>
  <text start="92.84" dur="5.22">Venezuela and this is due to the deep</text>
  <text start="96.38" dur="4.32">state putting a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="98.06" dur="5.25">Venezuela they want the oil invent</text>
  <text start="100.7" dur="6.449">Venezuela and they are using economic</text>
  <text start="103.31" dur="5.759">means to squeeze Venezuela as hard as</text>
  <text start="107.149" dur="3.691">they possibly can and it&amp;#39;s making it</text>
  <text start="109.069" dur="3.541">very difficult for the people where</text>
  <text start="110.84" dur="4.529">people can&amp;#39;t get supplies they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="112.61" dur="5.13">food and there is it&amp;#39;s a very tough</text>
  <text start="115.369" dur="5.011">situation in Venezuela right now now</text>
  <text start="117.74" dur="5.129">here in the United States we are seeing</text>
  <text start="120.38" dur="5.159">a lot of things happening and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="122.869" dur="4.591">seeing the economy while every passing</text>
  <text start="125.539" dur="3.631">day right now the economy is getting</text>
  <text start="127.46" dur="3.54">worse and worse and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="129.17" dur="4.379">interesting today the market just shot</text>
  <text start="131" dur="4.739">up like crazy and we see that minuchin</text>
  <text start="133.549" dur="3.81">he&amp;#39;s out there pushing the idea that</text>
  <text start="135.739" dur="3.601">dollar is going to be going higher and</text>
  <text start="137.359" dur="3.511">it&amp;#39;s completely opposite of what Trump</text>
  <text start="139.34" dur="3.269">is saying but we&amp;#39;ll get into that in a</text>
  <text start="140.87" dur="4.89">little bit later but I wanted to point</text>
  <text start="142.609" dur="7.201">out that gold well it has been slammed</text>
  <text start="145.76" dur="6.27">down now for the third day in a row and</text>
  <text start="149.81" dur="4.97">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="152.03" dur="7.95">this is that they keep slamming it down</text>
  <text start="154.78" dur="8.44">but gold is holding steady for some</text>
  <text start="159.98" dur="5.759">reason they can&amp;#39;t get it to move and</text>
  <text start="163.22" dur="4.47">this is the third day in a row now</text>
  <text start="165.739" dur="3.87">normally in the past when they did a</text>
  <text start="167.69" dur="4.71">slam like this gold would drop</text>
  <text start="169.609" dur="4.831">dramatically so it looks like at this</text>
  <text start="172.4" dur="5.49">point they&amp;#39;re having a little bit of</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="5.46">trouble controlling gold right now and</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="3.72">this is something that we need to watch</text>
  <text start="179.9" dur="3.3">and look at very carefully</text>
  <text start="181.61" dur="3.96">because as we said as they continually</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="4.47">try to slam goal down and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="185.57" dur="4.29">move anymore and every time they try to</text>
  <text start="187.67" dur="6.03">slam it down and it starts to move up</text>
  <text start="189.86" dur="5.07">well things are about to change and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="193.7" dur="2.97">not talking about moving up like a</text>
  <text start="194.93" dur="3.03">dollar or two or ten bucks or twenty</text>
  <text start="196.67" dur="3.54">bucks i&amp;#39;m talking about fifty a hundred</text>
  <text start="197.96" dur="4.56">a hundred and fifty when you start to</text>
  <text start="200.21" dur="6.62">see that you know the countdown has</text>
  <text start="202.52" dur="7.53">begun and things are about to change now</text>
  <text start="206.83" dur="6.879">continuous jobless claims they are at</text>
  <text start="210.05" dur="9.9">the lowest since april of two thousand</text>
  <text start="213.709" dur="9.121">and the year of 2000 when the jobless</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="5.49">claims were this low the Nasdaq peaked</text>
  <text start="222.83" dur="4.86">at the end of the dot-com boom and then</text>
  <text start="225.44" dur="6.21">it collapsed over eighty percent in the</text>
  <text start="227.69" dur="6.71">next two years so we are following this</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="6.3">pattern where we see jobless claims</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="6.85">continually decline and every time they</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="5.759">hit a certain point we have problems so</text>
  <text start="241.25" dur="4.35">we have the industrial production we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.709" dur="3.361">seeing indicators of the same exact</text>
  <text start="245.6" dur="5.16">thing we&amp;#39;re seeing jobless claims</text>
  <text start="247.07" dur="5.61">showing the same exact pattern and when</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="3.479">we look at this and we look at what is</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="3.119">happening with industrial production and</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="4.711">we looking at what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="255.799" dur="7.321">continuous jobless claims we can see</text>
  <text start="258.95" dur="7.44">during 2008 they both fell at the same</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="6.24">time and we went into a recession well</text>
  <text start="266.39" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re manipulating the continuing</text>
  <text start="269.36" dur="6.869">continuing jobless claims because they</text>
  <text start="271.58" dur="6.39">are not falling the way they did back in</text>
  <text start="276.229" dur="5.101">two thousand eight but industrial</text>
  <text start="277.97" dur="5.699">production that is declining right now</text>
  <text start="281.33" dur="6.18">so they&amp;#39;re heading in opposite</text>
  <text start="283.669" dur="6.721">directions which tells us something is</text>
  <text start="287.51" dur="4.59">going on here and we know that</text>
  <text start="290.39" dur="4.5">continuing jobless claims they are</text>
  <text start="292.1" dur="5.22">completely manipulated so this is hardly</text>
  <text start="294.89" dur="4.98">a leading indicator of awesome times</text>
  <text start="297.32" dur="5.25">ahead right now this is an indicator</text>
  <text start="299.87" dur="4.77">that things are rapidly changing now we</text>
  <text start="302.57" dur="4.89">talked about a lot of retail stores that</text>
  <text start="304.64" dur="4.26">are closing and a lot more are going to</text>
  <text start="307.46" dur="4.62">be closing a lot of people are going to</text>
  <text start="308.9" dur="6.18">be laid off and for the first time in 52</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="5.97">years of operation subway</text>
  <text start="315.08" dur="7.26">they announced that it contracted in</text>
  <text start="318.05" dur="7.32">2016 and we see right now that it looks</text>
  <text start="322.34" dur="6.12">like they&amp;#39;re going to be shutting some</text>
  <text start="325.37" dur="5.849">of their stores this does not look good</text>
  <text start="328.46" dur="6.9">because what is happening now is people</text>
  <text start="331.219" dur="7.23">can&amp;#39;t even go out and purchase fast food</text>
  <text start="335.36" dur="4.89">we know that the restaurant index is</text>
  <text start="338.449" dur="3.9">continually dropping we know the traffic</text>
  <text start="340.25" dur="5.159">is drying up and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="342.349" dur="5.341">signs of this and this is a big problem</text>
  <text start="345.409" dur="4.44">so when we look day to day to day to day</text>
  <text start="347.69" dur="4.409">and we go back maybe month to month we</text>
  <text start="349.849" dur="4.5">see things are rapidly changing very</text>
  <text start="352.099" dur="5.79">very quickly actually verizon right now</text>
  <text start="354.349" dur="6.271">the largest US wireless carrier by</text>
  <text start="357.889" dur="4.981">subscribers reported earnings which</text>
  <text start="360.62" dur="3.9">missed on both the top and bottom line</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="5.609">this is the first quarter of 2017</text>
  <text start="364.52" dur="6.739">verizon posted its first ever quarterly</text>
  <text start="368.479" dur="6.271">net loss of wireless subscribers and</text>
  <text start="371.259" dur="4.991">revenue declined by 7.3 percent to</text>
  <text start="374.75" dur="3.529">twenty nine point eight billion missing</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="6.029">estimates of 30 point eight billion</text>
  <text start="378.279" dur="6.311">again not a good sign IBM same thing</text>
  <text start="382.279" dur="4.95">caterpillar the same thing and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="384.59" dur="5.52">seeing a lot of retail stores closing</text>
  <text start="387.229" dur="5.671">the philly fed manufacturing survey it</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="5.669">is collapsed in the last two months the</text>
  <text start="392.9" dur="5.129">biggest drop since January of 2015 the</text>
  <text start="395.779" dur="4.771">22 print missed expectations among the</text>
  <text start="398.029" dur="5.371">lowest since December of 2016 I&amp;#39;m in a</text>
  <text start="400.55" dur="5.429">big slump in new orders and shipments so</text>
  <text start="403.4" dur="5.669">we&amp;#39;re starting to see the soft data well</text>
  <text start="405.979" dur="5.4">that&amp;#39;s completely null and void the hard</text>
  <text start="409.069" dur="4.77">data is showing exactly what is going on</text>
  <text start="411.379" dur="5.51">and since the election where we had all</text>
  <text start="413.839" dur="5.101">this hype is dead cat bounce of all this</text>
  <text start="416.889" dur="4.45">information all these economic</text>
  <text start="418.94" dur="4.71">indicators well they&amp;#39;re all reversing</text>
  <text start="421.339" dur="4.83">right now and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="423.65" dur="6.389">things are rapidly changing now the Fed</text>
  <text start="426.169" dur="6.18">came out with their beige book and there</text>
  <text start="430.039" dur="4.38">were three things in the beige book that</text>
  <text start="432.349" dur="5.25">really didn&amp;#39;t make any sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="434.419" dur="5.391">and they were talking about industrial</text>
  <text start="437.599" dur="5.25">production and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="439.81" dur="5.409">industrial production well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.849" dur="5.311">strengthening it reported that auto</text>
  <text start="445.219" dur="4.681">sales well they were strength</text>
  <text start="448.16" dur="4.38">but when you look at the real numbers</text>
  <text start="449.9" dur="5.34">mark auto sales final numbers down five</text>
  <text start="452.54" dur="5.25">point seven percent two-year low that</text>
  <text start="455.24" dur="5.01">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense they also reported</text>
  <text start="457.79" dur="4.92">non-auto retail spending they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="4.86">that retail sales well they were a</text>
  <text start="462.71" dur="4.86">little bit softer but everything is fine</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="5.58">the fact of the matter is retail sales</text>
  <text start="467.57" dur="5.67">unexpectedly declined revisions are even</text>
  <text start="470.69" dur="4.86">worse so again what are they talking</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="4.23">about I mean are they just out there</text>
  <text start="475.55" dur="3.18">pushing the propaganda trying to make</text>
  <text start="477.47" dur="4.02">everyone believe that the economy is</text>
  <text start="478.73" dur="5.13">fine so they can say that oh look it was</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="3.84">all due to Donald Trump I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.86" dur="4.67">what we&amp;#39;re starting to see right now</text>
  <text start="485.33" dur="6.65">they also said wage increases are</text>
  <text start="488.53" dur="7.72">broadening well now wage growth is</text>
  <text start="491.98" dur="7.39">non-existent since august of 1971 and if</text>
  <text start="496.25" dur="5.79">you factor in price inflation you can</text>
  <text start="499.37" dur="4.74">see that no wages are not growing</text>
  <text start="502.04" dur="5.85">actually wages are declining right now</text>
  <text start="504.11" dur="6.27">and these are very strange things in the</text>
  <text start="507.89" dur="5.16">beige book that are not hooked to any</text>
  <text start="510.38" dur="4.5">type of reality whatsoever they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="513.05" dur="4.049">making this stuff up to make everyone</text>
  <text start="514.88" dur="3.45">believe that everything is fine and of</text>
  <text start="517.099" dur="3.511">course the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="518.33" dur="5.19">and this is going wrong with it that</text>
  <text start="520.61" dur="5.46">everything is great but there are some</text>
  <text start="523.52" dur="5.07">corporate media outlets out there giving</text>
  <text start="526.07" dur="3.96">us a hint of what is to come because</text>
  <text start="528.59" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re saying that things are starting</text>
  <text start="530.03" dur="4.44">to change a little bit and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="4.92">trying to explain it away which we</text>
  <text start="534.47" dur="3.84">reported on a couple days ago so we can</text>
  <text start="537.05" dur="3.78">see already they&amp;#39;re starting the</text>
  <text start="538.31" dur="4.23">propaganda the economy was great Trump</text>
  <text start="540.83" dur="4.14">came into office things are not looking</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="7.95">good anymore and this is how it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="8.43">to go now Trump is pushing the agenda to</text>
  <text start="550.49" dur="6.33">collapse the economy I know many people</text>
  <text start="553.4" dur="6.18">like no he&amp;#39;s not doing this no yes he is</text>
  <text start="556.82" dur="5.1">he is definitely getting prepared and</text>
  <text start="559.58" dur="5.13">ready to bring this down he looked at</text>
  <text start="561.92" dur="5.73">the US economy just like he looks at his</text>
  <text start="564.71" dur="6.21">businesses he knows when things are done</text>
  <text start="567.65" dur="5.25">here he knows that it&amp;#39;s time to bring it</text>
  <text start="570.92" dur="4.56">down and we are getting indicators that</text>
  <text start="572.9" dur="4.38">he&amp;#39;s starting to do this where he</text>
  <text start="575.48" dur="4.29">already told the Fed because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.28" dur="4.2">raising interest rates and they want a</text>
  <text start="579.77" dur="3.78">strong dollar he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="581.48" dur="4.14">mainly opposite I believe that interest</text>
  <text start="583.55" dur="4.529">rates that are lower and a weaker dollar</text>
  <text start="585.62" dur="4.92">would be better so he&amp;#39;s telling the Fed</text>
  <text start="588.079" dur="4.95">that I want the opposite now he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="590.54" dur="6.15">telling the Fed print as much as you</text>
  <text start="593.029" dur="6.841">possibly can now if the Fed starts to</text>
  <text start="596.69" dur="5.85">print more money QE this is going to be</text>
  <text start="599.87" dur="4.98">negative for the stocks and positive for</text>
  <text start="602.54" dur="4.77">gold that&amp;#39;s going to be very interesting</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="4.89">because he&amp;#39;s starting to switch all of</text>
  <text start="607.31" dur="4.26">this now what happens if Trump bullies</text>
  <text start="609.74" dur="3.659">the fed into accepting his higher growth</text>
  <text start="611.57" dur="2.84">rates which he achieved by boosting</text>
  <text start="613.399" dur="3.361">government spending and borrowing</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="3.91">billions could it happen in the first</text>
  <text start="616.76" dur="3.93">place well yes it could because in the</text>
  <text start="618.32" dur="4.769">70s Richard Nixon bullied the fed into</text>
  <text start="620.69" dur="5.459">printing money so that he could win the</text>
  <text start="623.089" dur="5.461">19 72 election it can happen because it</text>
  <text start="626.149" dur="4.05">happened now Wall Street would wobble</text>
  <text start="628.55" dur="5.31">and the stock market most likely would</text>
  <text start="630.199" dur="7.591">fall and gold will probably shoot up now</text>
  <text start="633.86" dur="5.339">on January 17 2017 The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="637.79" dur="3.479">Journal published an article in which</text>
  <text start="639.199" dur="3.871">Trump stated point blank that the US</text>
  <text start="641.269" dur="5.19">dollar is too strong now we talked about</text>
  <text start="643.07" dur="5.34">this before and the US currency took</text>
  <text start="646.459" dur="3.711">note falling over one percent that day</text>
  <text start="648.41" dur="4.26">bringing it to a critical support and</text>
  <text start="650.17" dur="5.32">the Fed well they had different plans</text>
  <text start="652.67" dur="5.25">they hiked the interest rates they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="655.49" dur="5.25">going to hike it many more times in 2017</text>
  <text start="657.92" dur="5.55">and the US dollar reclaimed this line</text>
  <text start="660.74" dur="5.82">and has since maintained it so last week</text>
  <text start="663.47" dur="7.26">Trump struck again this time tweeting</text>
  <text start="666.56" dur="7.019">the US dollar is too strong and we can</text>
  <text start="670.73" dur="5.25">see right now that Trump wants a lower</text>
  <text start="673.579" dur="5.37">US dollar and it&amp;#39;s also obvious that</text>
  <text start="675.98" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s trying to basically do the opposite</text>
  <text start="678.949" dur="4.051">of what the Fed is doing right now</text>
  <text start="680.66" dur="5.19">because we know what the Fed is doing</text>
  <text start="683" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s raising the interest rates because</text>
  <text start="685.85" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared to collapse the</text>
  <text start="687.44" dur="3.93">economy he also sees that the economy</text>
  <text start="689.72" dur="3.9">needs to be collapsed and it has to be</text>
  <text start="691.37" dur="4.649">completely restarted because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="693.62" dur="4.92">way out of this whatsoever and this is</text>
  <text start="696.019" dur="6.12">why he&amp;#39;s doing the opposite of what the</text>
  <text start="698.54" dur="6.45">Fed wants and as he brings the dollar</text>
  <text start="702.139" dur="6.151">lower as he wants the Fed to print more</text>
  <text start="704.99" dur="6.27">currency as the Fed raises interest</text>
  <text start="708.29" dur="5.94">rates but what&amp;#39;s going to happen to gold</text>
  <text start="711.26" dur="4.13">well if Trump continues to push the US</text>
  <text start="714.23" dur="4.91">dollar lower</text>
  <text start="715.39" dur="6.35">gold will only perform even better look</text>
  <text start="719.14" dur="6.87">what&amp;#39;s happened in the last three days</text>
  <text start="721.74" dur="7.93">where we see we&amp;#39;ve seen thousands of</text>
  <text start="726.01" dur="6.63">contracts thrown at gold these are</text>
  <text start="729.67" dur="5.22">derivative contracts they cannot bring</text>
  <text start="732.64" dur="4.32">gold down like they did before where</text>
  <text start="734.89" dur="4.38">they used to drop thirty forty dollars</text>
  <text start="736.96" dur="4.11">fifty dollars and each one should have</text>
  <text start="739.27" dur="3.87">brought gold down thirty forty fifty</text>
  <text start="741.07" dur="4.02">dollars to bring it back to the level</text>
  <text start="743.14" dur="6.03">probably around eleven hundred or so it</text>
  <text start="745.09" dur="6.39">didn&amp;#39;t work now as he continually pushes</text>
  <text start="749.17" dur="4.62">for a lower dollar gold is going to</text>
  <text start="751.48" dur="5.07">continually rise now the central bank</text>
  <text start="753.79" dur="4.44">those who are trying to control the gold</text>
  <text start="756.55" dur="4.26">market the precious metals market</text>
  <text start="758.23" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re going to continually try to dump</text>
  <text start="760.81" dur="4.95">more contracts but people are going to</text>
  <text start="764.11" dur="3.06">see this and they&amp;#39;re going to say okay</text>
  <text start="765.76" dur="3.3">what is going on here the dollar is</text>
  <text start="767.17" dur="4.53">decreasing they&amp;#39;re continually thrown</text>
  <text start="769.06" dur="5.4">contracts at gold something is happening</text>
  <text start="771.7" dur="6.78">right now let&amp;#39;s just buy gold just in</text>
  <text start="774.46" dur="6.33">case now we can see right now that gold</text>
  <text start="778.48" dur="4.83">will then start to move up so this is</text>
  <text start="780.79" dur="6.9">what we&amp;#39;re looking at from this point on</text>
  <text start="783.31" dur="7.68">on how gold does will it maintain the</text>
  <text start="787.69" dur="7.23">upward trend and will trump continually</text>
  <text start="790.99" dur="6.93">lower the dollar right now while the Fed</text>
  <text start="794.92" dur="5.07">raises the rates because all of this is</text>
  <text start="797.92" dur="5.73">going to end up in a collapse scenario</text>
  <text start="799.99" dur="6.24">and we can see both sides are playing</text>
  <text start="803.65" dur="4.05">each other because they know it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="806.23" dur="2.67">to bring down the economy the Fed wants</text>
  <text start="807.7" dur="2.94">to bring it down they want to bring it</text>
  <text start="808.9" dur="3.51">down orderly Trump wants to bring it</text>
  <text start="810.64" dur="3.87">down he wants to bring it down orderly</text>
  <text start="812.41" dur="4.83">and they want to blame each other and</text>
  <text start="814.51" dur="5.67">this is the battle right now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="817.24" dur="4.56">going on but the positive out of all</text>
  <text start="820.18" dur="4.29">this as the economy is falling and the</text>
  <text start="821.8" dur="4.38">dollar is weakening gold is going to be</text>
  <text start="824.47" dur="4.17">moving up silver is going to be moving</text>
  <text start="826.18" dur="5.73">up and they&amp;#39;re going to eventually lose</text>
  <text start="828.64" dur="6.12">control of this and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="831.91" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re doing now Steve minuchin he is out</text>
  <text start="834.76" dur="4.44">there saying that no we want a strong</text>
  <text start="837.07" dur="4.74">dollar no we&amp;#39;re going to have tax cuts</text>
  <text start="839.2" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;re going to be doing all this now I</text>
  <text start="841.81" dur="5.78">know that he is part of Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="844.57" dur="4.68">and when Trump came into office the</text>
  <text start="847.59" dur="2.8">Republicans didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="849.25" dur="3.27">the Democrats didn&amp;#39;t want him no</text>
  <text start="850.39" dur="3.57">actually really wanted him and he know</text>
  <text start="852.52" dur="3.54">how to make some concessions so he had</text>
  <text start="853.96" dur="3.42">to bring certain people on and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="856.06" dur="3.81">letting these people dig their own</text>
  <text start="857.38" dur="4.23">graves right now I know people don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="859.87" dur="3.66">it they think that he&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="861.61" dur="3.39">problem here but we don&amp;#39;t know that yet</text>
  <text start="863.53" dur="4.38">because we&amp;#39;re looking at many different</text>
  <text start="865" dur="5.46">indicators and a lot of them right now</text>
  <text start="867.91" dur="6.63">don&amp;#39;t even make sense of what everyone</text>
  <text start="870.46" dur="7.02">is saying that he is part of the deep</text>
  <text start="874.54" dur="4.59">state he&amp;#39;s part of the problem because</text>
  <text start="877.48" dur="4.08">we can see that he&amp;#39;s still calling out</text>
  <text start="879.13" dur="4.76">the new york times for fake news CNN for</text>
  <text start="881.56" dur="5.61">fake news about this whole patriot</text>
  <text start="883.89" dur="4.84">football visit to the White House where</text>
  <text start="887.17" dur="3.77">the New York Times was still up there</text>
  <text start="888.73" dur="4.5">showing the differences between Obama</text>
  <text start="890.94" dur="4.53">when they heat when he had the Patriots</text>
  <text start="893.23" dur="4.89">and when Trump had the Patriots and</text>
  <text start="895.47" dur="4.6">again the Patriots even came out and</text>
  <text start="898.12" dur="3.3">said listen it&amp;#39;s fake news most of the</text>
  <text start="900.07" dur="3.51">staff was not on the steps this time</text>
  <text start="901.42" dur="4.83">they were in the audience so we could</text>
  <text start="903.58" dur="5.04">see right now that things are still not</text>
  <text start="906.25" dur="5.19">the way everyone thinks they are and</text>
  <text start="908.62" dur="5.55">he&amp;#39;s playing a game right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="911.44" dur="5.55">playing their game and he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="914.17" dur="4.98">trick them now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="916.99" dur="5.37">situation we can see where he&amp;#39;s moving</text>
  <text start="919.15" dur="6">he&amp;#39;s moving to bring gold up and the</text>
  <text start="922.36" dur="5.07">dollar down and he&amp;#39;s looking to counter</text>
  <text start="925.15" dur="3.99">everything the Fed is doing because he</text>
  <text start="927.43" dur="3.54">wants to do the old switcheroo to say</text>
  <text start="929.14" dur="4.26">listen since you were bringing up the</text>
  <text start="930.97" dur="4.41">interest rates you are the one who</text>
  <text start="933.4" dur="3.75">collapsed the economy and he can point</text>
  <text start="935.38" dur="4.65">back in time saying this is what</text>
  <text start="937.15" dur="4.68">happened back in 2007-2008 you did the</text>
  <text start="940.03" dur="3.9">same thing there if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="941.83" dur="5.7">once again he can say there is a pattern</text>
  <text start="943.93" dur="7.23">of this and we see right now that this</text>
  <text start="947.53" dur="5.37">is the move he is making now again does</text>
  <text start="951.16" dur="4.32">it mean it&amp;#39;s going to be foolproof no</text>
  <text start="952.9" dur="5.37">absolutely not no plan is ever foolproof</text>
  <text start="955.48" dur="4.8">but we can see that he is making the</text>
  <text start="958.27" dur="4.86">move right now and the plan is to</text>
