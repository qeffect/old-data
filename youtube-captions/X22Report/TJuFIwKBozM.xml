  <text start="113" dur="6.27">story the stock market definitely does</text>
  <text start="115.52" dur="5.25">not tell any story whatsoever and when</text>

  <text start="148.85" dur="4.77">also know that corporations well they</text>
  <text start="151.25" dur="4.739">have these job wrecks and they want to</text>
  <text start="153.62" dur="5.28">keep them open but there&amp;#39;s a hiring</text>
  <text start="155.989" dur="4.771">freeze if they don&amp;#39;t interview people</text>
  <text start="158.9" dur="3.6">and they don&amp;#39;t continually bring in</text>
  <text start="160.76" dur="3.599">people just to interview they&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="162.5" dur="4.62">gonna hire them they lose their job</text>
  <text start="164.359" dur="5.85">wrecks and this usually comes down from</text>
  <text start="167.12" dur="6.06">higher up in the company telling you yes</text>

  <text start="180.38" dur="6.42">wreck now we&amp;#39;re seeing a pattern that we</text>
  <text start="185.69" dur="6.78">saw up back</text>
  <text start="186.8" dur="9.03">in 2007 going into 2008 where the job</text>
  <text start="192.47" dur="7.68">openings and hires they start to decline</text>
  <text start="195.83" dur="7.17">at the same time and we are now seeing</text>
  <text start="200.15" dur="6.9">this and we have been seeing it since</text>
  <text start="203" dur="8.04">2016 it is now on the downward</text>
  <text start="207.05" dur="7.83">trajectory which tells us that we are</text>
  <text start="211.04" dur="5.67">heading towards another recession that</text>
  <text start="214.88" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same patterns all over</text>
  <text start="216.71" dur="6.66">the place we&amp;#39;re also seeing these new</text>
  <text start="220.22" dur="5.88">chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="7.38">States where in the month of December</text>
  <text start="226.1" dur="7.14">they have doubled from a year ago to six</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="4.62">hundred and ninety nine filings that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="233.24" dur="5.61">jump of three hundred and sixty two</text>
  <text start="235.37" dur="6.03">filings from last year this is the</text>
  <text start="238.85" dur="6.18">largest year-over-year jump since the</text>
  <text start="241.4" dur="5.67">financial crisis and if we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="5.7">incredible economy and everything is</text>
  <text start="247.07" dur="6.12">recovering why would we have all of</text>
  <text start="250.73" dur="6.42">these bankruptcies it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="253.19" dur="5.69">a spike like this in Chapter eleven</text>
  <text start="257.15" dur="5.73">filings in a month of December is</text>
  <text start="258.88" dur="5.74">unheard of in normal times normally</text>
  <text start="262.88" dur="4.53">bankruptcies jumped during tax season</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="5.61">the first four or five months of the</text>
  <text start="267.41" dur="5.22">year but not at the end of the year but</text>
  <text start="270.23" dur="6">again we&amp;#39;re not in normal times we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="6.9">living in an illusion in December the</text>
  <text start="276.23" dur="5.82">chapter 11 filing soared by 61% from</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="4.68">November and when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="282.05" dur="4.68">could see that yes this has happened now</text>
  <text start="284.21" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before not in the month</text>
  <text start="286.73" dur="3.75">of December but we&amp;#39;ve seen it before</text>
  <text start="288.26" dur="4.17">where there was a lot of companies</text>
  <text start="290.48" dur="3.93">filing for chapter 11 this was the oil</text>
  <text start="292.43" dur="4.68">bust then we had the brick and mortar</text>
  <text start="294.41" dur="6.509">meltdown and now all of a sudden in</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="6.15">December we&amp;#39;ve had a huge surge in a</text>
  <text start="300.919" dur="3.901">number of bankruptcies this tells us</text>
  <text start="303.26" dur="3.51">that there&amp;#39;s something going on there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="4.56">something wrong with the economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.77" dur="5.43">breaking down very quickly if we look at</text>
  <text start="309.38" dur="8.22">past December&amp;#39;s and if we go back to</text>
  <text start="312.2" dur="8.04">2016 we go back to 2015 2014 actually we</text>
  <text start="317.6" dur="5.34">don&amp;#39;t see this in December</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="7.92">this is very interesting now Bill Gross</text>
  <text start="322.94" dur="9.14">the bond guru he made a statement last</text>
  <text start="328.16" dur="8.39">year on the 10-year yield and he said</text>
  <text start="332.08" dur="8.26">that ten-year yields persistently above</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="7.089">2.4 percent would signal a bear market</text>
  <text start="340.34" dur="6.63">now he said this last year and he is</text>
  <text start="343.639" dur="8.551">correct that the trend lines right now</text>
  <text start="346.97" dur="9.15">they have broken through and we see</text>
  <text start="352.19" dur="8.24">right now that it is above 2.4 percent</text>
  <text start="356.12" dur="9.21">and this is another indicator that</text>
  <text start="360.43" dur="6.82">something is headed our way and we know</text>
  <text start="365.33" dur="5.69">that from everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="367.25" dur="7.59">looking at the economy is breaking apart</text>
  <text start="371.02" dur="5.079">behind the scenes it always happens</text>
  <text start="374.84" dur="5.13">behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="376.099" dur="7.681">before it gets to the public because the</text>
  <text start="379.97" dur="7.74">public is always kept in the dark until</text>
  <text start="383.78" dur="7.53">the very last minute just go back to</text>
  <text start="387.71" dur="4.949">2008 everyone was kept in the dark</text>
  <text start="391.31" dur="3.51">telling you everything was great</text>
  <text start="392.659" dur="4.711">everything sustained and at the same</text>
  <text start="394.82" dur="4.68">time they were telling you this the</text>
  <text start="397.37" dur="3.799">triple-a rated subprime securities were</text>
  <text start="399.5" dur="5.03">complete garbage</text>
  <text start="401.169" dur="6.31">AIG well they knew they needed a bailout</text>
  <text start="404.53" dur="4.33">they knew the automobile manufacturers</text>
  <text start="407.479" dur="3.391">were in trouble they were going to go</text>
  <text start="408.86" dur="6.299">bankrupt they knew there were problems</text>
  <text start="410.87" dur="8.4">with Lehman Bear Stearns and all the</text>
  <text start="415.159" dur="8.01">other banks they already knew that there</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="7.38">was a huge amount of problems in the</text>
  <text start="423.169" dur="6.571">economy they already knew we were in a</text>
  <text start="426.65" dur="6.03">recession because people were already</text>
  <text start="429.74" dur="4.35">getting laid off but they kept everyone</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="3.72">looking at the stock market which</text>
  <text start="434.09" dur="5.669">reached new highs of 14,000 points</text>
  <text start="436.4" dur="6.15">during 2018 yes it started to come down</text>
  <text start="439.759" dur="5.28">a little bit but they kept all eyes on</text>
  <text start="442.55" dur="5.31">that and remember after 2008 they</text>
  <text start="445.039" dur="6.541">figured out how to keep an illusion</text>
  <text start="447.86" dur="5.67">alive by taking control of the entire</text>
  <text start="451.58" dur="4.35">system</text>
  <text start="453.53" dur="6.51">and that&amp;#39;s what they did they have now</text>
  <text start="455.93" dur="8.91">taken control of the entire system they</text>
  <text start="460.04" dur="7.32">leave nothing to chance because if they</text>
  <text start="464.84" dur="4.16">leave it to chance if they let the stock</text>
  <text start="467.36" dur="5.1">market just do whatever it does</text>
  <text start="469" dur="9.34">naturally it wouldn&amp;#39;t be where it was if</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="9.03">they used real numbers and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="478.34" dur="5.28">manipulate them where they say oh these</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="3.66">people aren&amp;#39;t looking for jobs or the</text>
  <text start="483.62" dur="3.65">GDP number let&amp;#39;s go all the way back to</text>
  <text start="485.15" dur="5.19">1929 and add in research and development</text>
  <text start="487.27" dur="6.1">let&amp;#39;s take this out move this over here</text>
  <text start="490.34" dur="5.7">if they didn&amp;#39;t do all this the economy</text>
  <text start="493.37" dur="7.07">would be in shambles so they learned</text>
  <text start="496.04" dur="7.53">from their mistakes on how to control</text>
  <text start="500.44" dur="4.9">everything and at the same time they got</text>
  <text start="503.57" dur="4.53">permission to create currency like crazy</text>
  <text start="505.34" dur="5.7">which central bankers like to do because</text>
  <text start="508.1" dur="4.319">they like putting people into debt and</text>
  <text start="511.04" dur="3.27">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="512.419" dur="6.781">this is that this economy right now is</text>
  <text start="514.31" dur="8.34">being prepped and prepared to come down</text>
  <text start="519.2" dur="5.49">now we have two different factions that</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="4.02">are preparing this we have the Trump</text>
  <text start="524.69" dur="4.77">administration who wants to bring the</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="6.87">system down because it can&amp;#39;t be run any</text>
  <text start="529.46" dur="5.879">more and it has to change we have the</text>
  <text start="533.54" dur="3.78">central bank that wants to bring the</text>
  <text start="535.339" dur="5.25">system down because they want to move us</text>
  <text start="537.32" dur="8.519">into a new system and they don&amp;#39;t want us</text>
  <text start="540.589" dur="8.25">to know that they were responsible for</text>
  <text start="545.839" dur="4.831">the old system crashing now Trump is</text>
  <text start="548.839" dur="6.721">doing many different things to speed</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="7.53">this along his tax reform policy placing</text>
  <text start="555.56" dur="5.82">sanctions on certain countries because</text>
  <text start="558.2" dur="5.28">what effect has sanctions had now</text>
  <text start="561.38" dur="3.62">believe me the people in government they</text>
  <text start="563.48" dur="5.58">know what sanctions do they do nothing</text>
  <text start="565" dur="6.73">look at Cuba look at Iran look at Syria</text>
  <text start="569.06" dur="4.89">North Korea look at all the different</text>
  <text start="571.73" dur="5.64">countries sanctions did absolutely</text>
  <text start="573.95" dur="6.75">nothing it didn&amp;#39;t make the country bend</text>
  <text start="577.37" dur="5.13">and say we give it didn&amp;#39;t make them give</text>
  <text start="580.7" dur="4.35">up their sovereignty it didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="582.5" dur="4.8">anything they just found ways around the</text>
  <text start="585.05" dur="5.33">sanctions but what sanctions</text>
  <text start="587.3" dur="5.34">today is something very very different</text>
  <text start="590.38" dur="4.18">the sanctions that are placed in</text>
  <text start="592.64" dur="4.62">different countries they are forcing</text>
  <text start="594.56" dur="6.54">these countries like Venezuela like Iran</text>
  <text start="597.26" dur="8.7">like North Korea and many others to move</text>
  <text start="601.1" dur="7.83">closer to Russia and China away from the</text>
  <text start="605.96" dur="7.17">dollar remember the dollar that the</text>
  <text start="608.93" dur="6.51">Federal Reserve Note is the cabal&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.13" dur="6.84">money it&amp;#39;s not the people&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="615.44" dur="8.28">it&amp;#39;s the cabal&amp;#39;s money and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="619.97" dur="6.75">seeing right now is that the Trump</text>
  <text start="623.72" dur="5.22">administration is trying to destroy the</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="5.85">cabal&amp;#39;s money the only way to move</text>
  <text start="628.94" dur="8.79">forward is to cut off the funds to the</text>
  <text start="632.57" dur="7.44">Cabal to these individuals and start</text>
  <text start="637.73" dur="4.56">anew and if you&amp;#39;re gonna start anew you</text>
  <text start="640.01" dur="5.7">need to bring back manufacturing you</text>
  <text start="642.29" dur="6.66">need to have trade which is why the u.s.</text>
  <text start="645.71" dur="5.75">is going to be joining the one belt one</text>
  <text start="648.95" dur="6.66">road system can&amp;#39;t happen right now</text>
  <text start="651.46" dur="8.08">because the Cabal is still there the</text>
  <text start="655.61" dur="5.55">corporate media is still there which is</text>
  <text start="659.54" dur="5.07">controlled by the intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="661.16" dur="7.74">but down the line this will happen now</text>
  <text start="664.61" dur="7.47">Iran is looking to move towards China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="668.9" dur="6.87">petrol you won Venezuela is looking to</text>
  <text start="672.08" dur="6.63">move towards the petrol you won all of</text>
  <text start="675.77" dur="5.88">this moves these countries away from the</text>
  <text start="678.71" dur="5.88">US dollar and this is being done very</text>
  <text start="681.65" dur="4.47">very slowly and a lot of times the Cabal</text>
  <text start="684.59" dur="3.48">doesn&amp;#39;t even know this is being done</text>
  <text start="686.12" dur="3.45">they think oh yeah let&amp;#39;s place more</text>
  <text start="688.07" dur="3.48">sanctions on these countries this is</text>
  <text start="689.57" dur="4.79">great but they don&amp;#39;t see the underlying</text>
  <text start="691.55" dur="6.48">plan of why this is all being done and</text>
  <text start="694.36" dur="7.75">the reason for this is to take us out of</text>
  <text start="698.03" dur="8.16">their system and the economy can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="702.11" dur="6.51">repaired it can&amp;#39;t all of a sudden switch</text>
  <text start="706.19" dur="4.26">around and everything is great this is</text>
  <text start="708.62" dur="3.93">why Trump is out there saying yes the</text>
  <text start="710.45" dur="4.41">stock market&amp;#39;s moving up yes the economy</text>
  <text start="712.55" dur="3.93">is doing great he&amp;#39;s playing their game</text>
  <text start="714.86" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s almost like when Trump was out</text>
  <text start="716.48" dur="3.93">there saying yes we have bigger nuclear</text>
  <text start="718.37" dur="5.449">weapons than North Korea behind the</text>
  <text start="720.41" dur="6.359">scenes there&amp;#39;s another plane going on</text>
  <text start="723.819" dur="5.2">doesn&amp;#39;t want the Cabal doesn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="726.769" dur="6.661">corporate media doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone else</text>
  <text start="729.019" dur="7.32">to know about this and this is a</text>
  <text start="733.43" dur="4.709">strategy I know people think like oh no</text>
