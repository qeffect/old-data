  <text start="187.39" dur="4.14">the ruling elite it raises some serious</text>
  <text start="189.94" dur="6.98">questions about the nature of the leak</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="8.19">itself some are saying is this leak a</text>
  <text start="196.92" dur="7.09">strategic intelligence operation called</text>
  <text start="199.72" dur="6.68">limited hangout now this is a favorite</text>
  <text start="204.01" dur="5.91">and frequently used gimmick of</text>
  <text start="206.4" dur="5.62">professionals when their veil of secrecy</text>
  <text start="209.92" dur="4.08">is shredded and they can no longer rely</text>
  <text start="212.02" dur="4.62">on phony cover stories to misinform the</text>
  <text start="214" dur="5.97">public they resort to admitting</text>
  <text start="216.64" dur="6.08">sometimes even volunteering some of the</text>
  <text start="219.97" dur="6.6">truth while still managing to withhold</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="6.96">certain key elements and damaging facts</text>
  <text start="226.57" dur="5.16">in the case the public however is</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="5.05">usually so intrigued by the new</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="4.979">information but they never think to</text>
  <text start="234.73" dur="3.72">pursue the matter further they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="236.709" dur="4.771">happy with the leak coming out and</text>
  <text start="238.45" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re happy with the propaganda and we</text>
  <text start="241.48" dur="3.96">can see that this is what is good</text>
  <text start="243.22" dur="4.519">happening at this point and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="245.44" dur="6.78">continually pushing their agenda and</text>
  <text start="247.739" dur="6.97">pushing it towards other countries now</text>
  <text start="252.22" dur="6.42">as soon as the Panama papers were</text>
  <text start="254.709" dur="6.691">released two days after we see the IRS</text>
  <text start="258.64" dur="5.279">headquarters is going to remain closed</text>
  <text start="261.4" dur="6.93">for the rest of the week because of a</text>
  <text start="263.919" dur="5.821">basement fire in the building hmm you</text>
  <text start="268.33" dur="4.61">think there&amp;#39;s some records that are</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="6.39">being destroyed at this time maybe</text>
  <text start="272.94" dur="5.59">because it&amp;#39;s very odd that all of a</text>
  <text start="276.13" dur="5.13">sudden we had a fire I mean we see this</text>
  <text start="278.53" dur="5.699">a lot where all of a sudden it comes out</text>
  <text start="281.26" dur="4.98">of nowhere and we see this in many false</text>
  <text start="284.229" dur="3.75">flags we&amp;#39;re all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="286.24" dur="4.53">building&amp;#39;s they need to take down they</text>
  <text start="287.979" dur="6.451">take down basements are flooded after a</text>
  <text start="290.77" dur="7.5">hurricane certain offices are hit and</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="5.54">exploded like the Pentagon we</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="4.74">they don&amp;#39;t want information out there</text>

  <text start="304.9" dur="7.38">Amendment rights if someone is offended</text>
  <text start="308.16" dur="7.48">now the first amendment has nothing to</text>
  <text start="312.28" dur="7.53">do with you being offended with hate</text>
  <text start="315.64" dur="7.89">speech it is the freedom to say whatever</text>
  <text start="319.81" dur="8.64">you want it is the freedom to speak out</text>
  <text start="323.53" dur="8.34">against your government and if you try</text>
  <text start="328.45" dur="5.88">to control that freedom it&amp;#39;s no longer</text>
  <text start="331.87" dur="4.68">free speech because someone is sitting</text>
  <text start="334.33" dur="4.02">there saying we don&amp;#39;t like that speech</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="3.75">because we consider it hate we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="338.35" dur="4.95">like that speech because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="340.3" dur="6.15">something wrong with it and we see this</text>
  <text start="343.3" dur="5.46">is what the US government is teaching</text>
  <text start="346.45" dur="4.68">our young at this point they&amp;#39;re teaching</text>
  <text start="348.76" dur="4.86">them that there&amp;#39;s certain speech that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.13" dur="5.84">okay and others that is not but in a</text>
  <text start="353.62" dur="9">true free society with free speech if</text>
  <text start="356.97" dur="10">you&amp;#39;re offended get over it if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.62" dur="8.16">offended don&amp;#39;t listen this is how it</text>
  <text start="366.97" dur="8.69">used to be and it seems today we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="7.95">bringing up a population of babies wimps</text>
  <text start="375.66" dur="6.4">even comedians are saying they can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="378.73" dur="6.9">into college campuses today and tell</text>
  <text start="382.06" dur="5.61">jokes because people are offended by it</text>
  <text start="385.63" dur="4.88">and there are many famous comedians to</text>
  <text start="387.67" dur="6.06">say they just won&amp;#39;t do it anymore and</text>
  <text start="390.51" dur="7.39">there is a huge problem in this country</text>
  <text start="393.73" dur="5.7">and I was watching the movie V I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="397.9" dur="4.02">know how many people seeing the movie V</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="6">for Vendetta but I thought something</text>
  <text start="401.92" dur="6.81">that V said during the first couple</text>
  <text start="405.43" dur="4.86">minutes of the movie was very</text>
  <text start="408.73" dur="5.34">interesting and i&amp;#39;m going to read what</text>
  <text start="410.29" dur="5.91">he said he said the truth is there is</text>
  <text start="414.07" dur="4.8">something terribly wrong with this</text>
  <text start="416.2" dur="5.69">country isn&amp;#39;t their cruelty and</text>
  <text start="418.87" dur="6">injustice intolerance and oppression and</text>
  <text start="421.89" dur="6.52">where once you had the freedom to object</text>
  <text start="424.87" dur="7.259">think and speak as you saw fit you now</text>
  <text start="428.41" dur="6.239">have sensors and systems of surveillance</text>
  <text start="432.129" dur="5.25">coercing your conformity and soliciting</text>
  <text start="434.649" dur="6.66">soliciting your submission how did this</text>
  <text start="437.379" dur="5.88">happen who&amp;#39;s to blame well certainly</text>
  <text start="441.309" dur="4.1">there are those more responsible than</text>
  <text start="443.259" dur="5.19">others and they will be held accountable</text>
  <text start="445.409" dur="5.38">but again the truth be told if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="448.449" dur="6.27">looking for the guilty you need only</text>
  <text start="450.789" dur="7.83">look into a mirror and he&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="454.719" dur="6.78">right for us to take back this country</text>
  <text start="458.619" dur="6.63">for us to say we want the rights the</text>
  <text start="461.499" dur="9.15">Constitution the freedom we need to look</text>
  <text start="465.249" dur="7.77">at ourselves we let this happen now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.649" dur="5.25">time to change now it&amp;#39;s time to say you</text>
  <text start="473.019" dur="5.85">know something we&amp;#39;ve had enough it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.899" dur="5.341">time to say okay we know what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.869" dur="5.1">doing at this point because if you</text>
  <text start="481.24" dur="5.929">watched the movie V for Vendetta and I</text>
  <text start="483.969" dur="6.87">know it&amp;#39;s a movie you it there there are</text>
  <text start="487.169" dur="7.75">huge parallels on what is going on today</text>
  <text start="490.839" dur="7.47">and if you watch you&amp;#39;ll see that the</text>
  <text start="494.919" dur="5.941">people they all know that the government</text>
  <text start="498.309" dur="5.1">is spewing lies they all know the</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="5.059">government is trying to convince them</text>
  <text start="503.409" dur="5.76">otherwise but everyone is afraid</text>
  <text start="505.919" dur="5.56">everyone&amp;#39;s sitting back everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.169" dur="5.961">saying I know it&amp;#39;s wrong but I know I</text>
  <text start="511.479" dur="7.381">feel that something&amp;#39;s not right and</text>
  <text start="515.13" dur="5.259">everyone is scared and that&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="518.86" dur="3.929">what&amp;#39;s happening today in many of the</text>
  <text start="520.389" dur="4.591">countries where people know they feel it</text>
  <text start="522.789" dur="6.15">there&amp;#39;s something wrong in this country</text>
  <text start="524.98" dur="6.27">there&amp;#39;s something wrong in the world but</text>
  <text start="528.939" dur="5.82">everyone is too afraid to do something</text>
  <text start="531.25" dur="6.779">about it and we have to get rid of this</text>
  <text start="534.759" dur="7.38">fear we have to strip away the</text>
  <text start="538.029" dur="7.17">brainwashing we need to make a change a</text>
  <text start="542.139" dur="5.25">change for the better now not saying to</text>
  <text start="545.199" dur="4.14">use violence but we need to start</text>
  <text start="547.389" dur="3.45">sticking together we need to start</text>
  <text start="549.339" dur="3.541">questioning the government we need to</text>
  <text start="550.839" dur="4.291">start saying hey we don&amp;#39;t agree with</text>
  <text start="552.88" dur="4.74">this and if we don&amp;#39;t stick together as a</text>
  <text start="555.13" dur="4.92">people we don&amp;#39;t come together as a</text>
  <text start="557.62" dur="4.5">people there will be no change</text>
  <text start="560.05" dur="3.389">whatsoever and this is something that</text>
  <text start="562.12" dur="3.06">everyone needs to start thinking about</text>
  <text start="563.439" dur="4.261">as we move</text>
  <text start="565.18" dur="6.54">further on because as this whole entire</text>
  <text start="567.7" dur="5.67">system collapses and as the central</text>
  <text start="571.72" dur="3.15">bankers the US government try to bring</text>
  <text start="573.37" dur="3.51">us to war we&amp;#39;re going to need to make a</text>
  <text start="574.87" dur="3.87">decision the country&amp;#39;s going to need to</text>
  <text start="576.88" dur="4.32">make a decision on what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="578.74" dur="5.78">do now out in the Netherlands they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581.2" dur="6.8">having a referendum and they&amp;#39;re voting</text>
  <text start="584.52" dur="5.62">about the eu-ukraine treaty and the</text>
  <text start="588" dur="4.51">people of Netherlands are being asked to</text>
  <text start="590.14" dur="4.47">decide whether to back a treaty which</text>
  <text start="592.51" dur="5.22">seeks to strengthen ties with Ukraine</text>
  <text start="594.61" dur="5.61">and it seems that the Dutch voters right</text>
  <text start="597.73" dur="5.19">now sixty-four percent of them are</text>
  <text start="600.22" dur="5.19">saying no to ratifying the EU crane deal</text>

  <text start="605.41" dur="7.29">course as you know they can fix these</text>
  <text start="609.52" dur="5.85">type of poles but at this point the exit</text>
  <text start="612.7" dur="5.48">poll is showing that 64% are saying</text>
  <text start="615.37" dur="7.02">absolutely not now will this affect the</text>
  <text start="618.18" dur="7.72">British exit maybe and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="622.39" dur="6.21">wait and see now China they are going</text>
  <text start="625.9" dur="4.5">along with the US and they are placing</text>
  <text start="628.6" dur="3.48">trade sanctions against North Korea</text>
  <text start="630.4" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re stepping away from North Korea</text>
  <text start="632.08" dur="4.47">because they don&amp;#39;t want to be involved</text>
  <text start="634.36" dur="3.66">in what is going on and that is the</text>
  <text start="636.55" dur="4.02">United States provoking North Korea</text>
  <text start="638.02" dur="6.51">hoping to get some type of war started</text>
  <text start="640.57" dur="6.42">and have China come in and join in on</text>

  <text start="723.61" dur="3.81">that most of them were going to be</text>
  <text start="724.81" dur="6.54">stepping down and giving power over to</text>
  <text start="727.42" dur="6.48">the unit un unity government now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="731.35" dur="5.7">done a one-eighty and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="733.9" dur="5.94">they refuse to cede power to the Libya</text>
  <text start="737.05" dur="4.76">unity government and they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="739.84" dur="4.85">to do it they issued a statement calling</text>
  <text start="741.81" dur="5.08">on the ministers not to stand down and</text>
  <text start="744.69" dur="5.71">threatening to prosecute anyone who</text>
  <text start="746.89" dur="5.43">cooperates with the new government so</text>
  <text start="750.4" dur="3.42">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things happening at</text>
  <text start="752.32" dur="4.47">this point we know the u.s. NATO</text>
  <text start="753.82" dur="5.04">coalition forces they just want to get</text>
  <text start="756.79" dur="3.87">in there and they want to make it look</text>
  <text start="758.86" dur="3.6">like it&amp;#39;s legal this is why they want</text>
  <text start="760.66" dur="3.39">the unity government in there this is</text>
  <text start="762.46" dur="3.81">why they keep saying it has to be</text>
  <text start="764.05" dur="3.93">political no basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="766.27" dur="4.29">saying is they want the unity government</text>
  <text start="767.98" dur="4.08">in there so they can bring in the troops</text>
  <text start="770.56" dur="3.03">and it doesn&amp;#39;t look like an invasion and</text>
  <text start="772.06" dur="3.96">the world will say well the government</text>
  <text start="773.59" dur="4.17">invited them in well it was their puppet</text>
  <text start="776.02" dur="3.78">government their puppet government is</text>
  <text start="777.76" dur="4.38">inviting them in this is what they want</text>
  <text start="779.8" dur="5.18">now the u.s. is looking to open up more</text>
  <text start="782.14" dur="6">fire bases in Iraq because as we know</text>
  <text start="784.98" dur="6.25">the u.s. is planning something very big</text>
  <text start="788.14" dur="5.67">in this region and they&amp;#39;re placing</text>
  <text start="791.23" dur="4.89">strategic bases they have troops in</text>
  <text start="793.81" dur="5.13">Syria more special op teams are headed</text>
  <text start="796.12" dur="5.25">off to Syria and we see a lot of the</text>
  <text start="798.94" dur="3.99">coalition troops filling the void for</text>
  <text start="801.37" dur="4.64">the Islamic state that are being pushed</text>
  <text start="802.93" dur="5.7">out the Islamic state once again is</text>
  <text start="806.01" dur="4.6">using chemical weapons as they lose</text>
  <text start="808.63" dur="5.37">territory they&amp;#39;re using chlorine gas</text>
  <text start="810.61" dur="6.99">that using mustard gas and we can see at</text>
  <text start="814" dur="4.71">this point that it&amp;#39;s the proxy army for</text>
  <text start="817.6" dur="4.17">the United States government it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="818.71" dur="4.5">free syrian army or the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="821.77" dur="3.78">or the opposition whatever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="823.21" dur="3.78">calling them today they are the ones</text>
  <text start="825.55" dur="3.9">that are continually using these</text>
  <text start="826.99" dur="4.57">chemical weapons and trying to pin it on</text>
  <text start="829.45" dur="4.72">Assad and</text>
  <text start="831.56" dur="6.32">is continually happening over and over</text>
  <text start="834.17" dur="6.42">and over now the Syrian government</text>
  <text start="837.88" dur="5.32">they&amp;#39;re going to participate in the new</text>
  <text start="840.59" dur="4.5">round of intra Syrian peace talks right</text>
  <text start="843.2" dur="5.49">after the parliamentary elections in</text>
  <text start="845.09" dur="6.42">April and the US Department is out there</text>
  <text start="848.69" dur="5.43">accusing Assad of violating the</text>
  <text start="851.51" dur="4.11">ceasefire now the question was brought</text>
  <text start="854.12" dur="4.23">up to Mark Toner saying hey what about</text>
  <text start="855.62" dur="3.93">the moderate rebels they&amp;#39;re violating</text>
  <text start="858.35" dur="3.3">the ceasefire and of course he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="859.55" dur="4.35">fumbling bumbling and he say no no</text>
  <text start="861.65" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re not violating the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="863.9" dur="5.72">whatsoever and then all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="867.62" dur="5.04">hear the moderate rebels the opposition</text>
  <text start="869.62" dur="5.17">they shot down an su-22 fighter now</text>
  <text start="872.66" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re supposed to not be firing at</text>
  <text start="874.79" dur="3.48">government forces the government forces</text>
  <text start="876.5" dur="3.18">are not supposed to be firing at the</text>
  <text start="878.27" dur="3.48">moderate rebels but we see right now</text>
  <text start="879.68" dur="3.57">that it was taken down now the United</text>
  <text start="881.75" dur="3.45">States they&amp;#39;re saying well we&amp;#39;re unable</text>
  <text start="883.25" dur="3.51">to confirm any of this at the moment and</text>
  <text start="885.2" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;ll have to really look into this to</text>
  <text start="886.76" dur="5.13">see what&amp;#39;s going on so they were caught</text>
  <text start="888.77" dur="7.08">once again where the rebels most likely</text>
  <text start="891.89" dur="7.23">with manpads took down this fighter jet</text>
  <text start="895.85" dur="6.81">and the question is where are they</text>
  <text start="899.12" dur="5.61">getting the ability to to fire at jets</text>
  <text start="902.66" dur="5.73">where they get in this type of military</text>
  <text start="904.73" dur="5.7">assets and if this the kit if this is</text>
  <text start="908.39" dur="4.29">the case where they&amp;#39;re getting these</text>
  <text start="910.43" dur="5.72">type of weapons this is going to change</text>
  <text start="912.68" dur="6.81">things in the region this is a threat to</text>
  <text start="916.15" dur="6.7">any type of aircraft some civilian</text>
  <text start="919.49" dur="9.48">aircraft and we can see this will change</text>
  <text start="922.85" dur="8.46">things in Syria now the US has troops</text>
  <text start="928.97" dur="6.3">based in Egypt&amp;#39;s Sinai Peninsula and</text>
  <text start="931.31" dur="7.32">they may be relocated in the region now</text>
  <text start="935.27" dur="5.16">it might be that Israel and the US are</text>
  <text start="938.63" dur="4.14">planning some type of operation in this</text>
  <text start="940.43" dur="4.86">area Israel might be planning some type</text>
  <text start="942.77" dur="3.78">of operation on their own or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="945.29" dur="3.27">bringing these troops into a different</text>
  <text start="946.55" dur="3.9">location to say with the troops are OD</text>
  <text start="948.56" dur="3.84">there and we&amp;#39;re going to take 700 of</text>
  <text start="950.45" dur="5.22">them and put them into a different area</text>
  <text start="952.4" dur="8.25">to be used in this next and upcoming</text>
  <text start="955.67" dur="9.34">event now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is we</text>
  <text start="960.65" dur="8.68">can see that the military spending</text>
  <text start="965.01" dur="8.64">has increased for the first time in five</text>
  <text start="969.33" dur="7.5">years so we see at this point that they</text>
  <text start="973.65" dur="5.67">increased military spending because they</text>
  <text start="976.83" dur="5.82">know a war is coming stockholm</text>
  <text start="979.32" dur="4.89">international peace research is saying</text>
  <text start="982.65" dur="6.99">that the united states are in the top</text>
  <text start="984.21" dur="9.57">spot by a ridiculous margin spinning 596</text>
  <text start="989.64" dur="7.77">billion in 2015 then China then Saudi</text>
  <text start="993.78" dur="5.46">Arabia and down the line because what</text>
  <text start="997.41" dur="3.84">happened was the United States started</text>
  <text start="999.24" dur="4.2">to move military asses to spend more</text>
  <text start="1001.25" dur="5.85">money and the other countries are saying</text>
  <text start="1003.44" dur="5.79">whoa what&amp;#39;s going on here why do we see</text>
  <text start="1007.1" dur="4.77">more troops more weapons why are we</text>
  <text start="1009.23" dur="4.74">encircled so they started ramping up</text>
  <text start="1011.87" dur="4.86">their military spending and if we look</text>
  <text start="1013.97" dur="4.44">out in China and the South China Sea we</text>
  <text start="1016.73" dur="3">see the Philippines their military</text>
  <text start="1018.41" dur="2.97">spending is up twenty five point five</text>
  <text start="1019.73" dur="5.94">percent Vietnam up seven point six</text>
  <text start="1021.38" dur="7.65">percent Malaysia up 7.7 Singapore up 5.6</text>
  <text start="1025.67" dur="7.529">Thailand up 6.5 and this is all</text>
  <text start="1029.03" dur="6.99">surrounding China we see in Eastern</text>
  <text start="1033.199" dur="6.63">Europe Estonia is up six point six</text>
  <text start="1036.02" dur="7.77">percent Latvia is up 13 Lithuania 32</text>
  <text start="1039.829" dur="6.811">Poland 21 these are the Baltic area and</text>
  <text start="1043.79" dur="4.68">this is surrounding Russia and yes</text>
  <text start="1046.64" dur="3.36">Russia they have increased their</text>
  <text start="1048.47" dur="5.43">military spending up seven point five</text>
  <text start="1050" dur="7.59">percent so we&amp;#39;re seeing there is an</text>
  <text start="1053.9" dur="7.38">increase of military spending we see</text>
  <text start="1057.59" dur="5.46">that the United States with NATO have</text>
  <text start="1061.28" dur="5.64">been bringing in more military troops</text>
  <text start="1063.05" dur="6.96">more military assets into the Pacific</text>
  <text start="1066.92" dur="5.97">into Eastern Europe to the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1070.01" dur="5.76">and into Africa and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="1072.89" dur="6.09">doing this preparing getting ready for</text>
  <text start="1075.77" dur="7.14">war now I&amp;#39;ve been looking over some</text>
  <text start="1078.98" dur="6.21">indicators and it&amp;#39;s starting to look</text>
  <text start="1082.91" dur="6.06">like in the next and I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="1085.19" dur="6.87">predict an exact time but i will say i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1088.97" dur="6.61">looking at this and it looks like we are</text>
  <text start="1092.06" dur="5.32">due for their next big event and</text>
  <text start="1095.58" dur="3.96">it could happen tomorrow but could</text>
  <text start="1097.38" dur="4.86">happen three weeks from now I mean if it</text>
  <text start="1099.54" dur="5.1">happens four or five weeks you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1102.24" dur="4.41">not exact here if I was a fortune-teller</text>
  <text start="1104.64" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;d be very very wealthy right now but</text>
  <text start="1106.65" dur="6.57">I&amp;#39;m looking at indicators they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1108.93" dur="5.82">pointing to another event and we need to</text>
  <text start="1113.22" dur="4.11">keep our eyes open now this could happen</text>
  <text start="1114.75" dur="4.86">in Europe this could happen in the</text>
  <text start="1117.33" dur="4.53">United States this could happen in the</text>
  <text start="1119.61" dur="5.22">Middle East in the Pacific we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1121.86" dur="4.41">exactly where most likely I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="1124.83" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s going to be some type of Islamic</text>
  <text start="1126.27" dur="4.74">state type of event where they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1129.36" dur="4.05">to be blaming that on them to get</text>
  <text start="1131.01" dur="4.2">something started how big is it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1133.41" dur="5.13">to be we don&amp;#39;t know at this point but</text>
  <text start="1135.21" dur="8.07">all we need to know at this time is to</text>
  <text start="1138.54" dur="6.45">look out for this next event coming now</text>
  <text start="1143.28" dur="5.58">most likely they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="1144.99" dur="7.32">increase the fear factor because last</text>
  <text start="1148.86" dur="5.58">time in Belgium they use the bomb and we</text>
  <text start="1152.31" dur="3.63">see it they&amp;#39;re changing it up now going</text>
  <text start="1154.44" dur="3.69">from people shooting people on the</text>
  <text start="1155.94" dur="4.26">street into bombs this might even be a</text>
  <text start="1158.13" dur="4.23">dirty nuke why is this all happening at</text>
  <text start="1160.2" dur="6.39">this point because as we can see the</text>
  <text start="1162.36" dur="5.58">economy is falling apart and crashing</text>
  <text start="1166.59" dur="3.6">they they were able to keep this</text>
  <text start="1167.94" dur="4.53">illusion alive right after the what was</text>
  <text start="1170.19" dur="3.57">at the g20 meeting all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="1172.47" dur="3.63">economy started to look like it was</text>
  <text start="1173.76" dur="4.53">doing much much better we know this is a</text>
  <text start="1176.1" dur="4.23">complete illusion they&amp;#39;re pumping it up</text>
  <text start="1178.29" dur="5.16">as best they possibly can so they can</text>
  <text start="1180.33" dur="4.47">blame this next event on another group</text>
  <text start="1183.45" dur="3.5">another country because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1184.8" dur="6.48">going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to say look</text>
  <text start="1186.95" dur="7.77">the economy was doing incredibly well it</text>
  <text start="1191.28" dur="6.51">was recovered and then all of a sudden</text>
