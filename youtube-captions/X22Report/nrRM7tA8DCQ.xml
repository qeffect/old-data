  <text start="122.49" dur="7.079">towards Russia and the BRIC nations</text>
  <text start="126.289" dur="6.161">because they look at the EU United</text>
  <text start="129.569" dur="5.671">States government central bankers and</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="5.33">they see a system that is dying a system</text>
  <text start="135.24" dur="5.31">that continually puts them into debt and</text>
  <text start="137.78" dur="4.33">right now the EU the United States is</text>
  <text start="140.55" dur="4.14">out there saying you cannot make this</text>
  <text start="142.11" dur="4.64">type of deal you need our approval from</text>
  <text start="144.69" dur="4.22">the EU and Greece is coming back saying</text>
  <text start="146.75" dur="5.65">absolutely not</text>
  <text start="148.91" dur="6.189">Greece has the right to its own actions</text>
  <text start="152.4" dur="5.22">and it&amp;#39;s independent diversified energy</text>
  <text start="155.099" dur="5.341">policies and this is coming from the</text>

  <text start="172.17" dur="4.92">diversified hub which could which could</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="6.03">supply natural gas to all of the</text>
  <text start="177.09" dur="7.62">European countries that need it and this</text>
  <text start="180.75" dur="6.72">is what they&amp;#39;re hoping to do now we</text>
  <text start="184.71" dur="5.22">understand that Russia invited Greece</text>
  <text start="187.47" dur="9.32">and made to become a member of the BRIC</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="11.82">system and we understand Greece Russia</text>
  <text start="196.79" dur="7.54">China the BRIC nations might be talking</text>
  <text start="201.75" dur="4.26">secretly in back rooms where no one</text>
  <text start="204.33" dur="3.36">really understands what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="206.01" dur="3.6">because all they&amp;#39;re hearing is that</text>
  <text start="207.69" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re trying to make this deal with</text>
  <text start="209.61" dur="3.81">the EU but we understand that certain</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="3.51">things are happening in the background</text>
  <text start="213.42" dur="5.37">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see some</text>
  <text start="215.49" dur="7.23">indication that yeah they might be</text>
  <text start="218.79" dur="6.54">moving towards the BRIC system right now</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="5.4">they say we are at the stage of a</text>
  <text start="225.33" dur="5.94">preliminary discussion to join the NDB</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="5.58">of BRICS so that Greece as soon as the</text>
  <text start="231.27" dur="5.82">bank starts to operate could become its</text>
  <text start="233.7" dur="8.1">equal member it will be one of the first</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="7.23">non founder members discussions on the</text>
  <text start="241.8" dur="4.91">issue had been very positive and the</text>
  <text start="244.32" dur="5.58">president of the NDB</text>
  <text start="246.71" dur="4.9">vimana come off said that he would</text>
  <text start="249.9" dur="3.6">support a Greek decision to become a</text>
  <text start="251.61" dur="5.129">member of the bank when the country</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="6.08">submitted its application so we can see</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="5.851">at this point in time that Greece and</text>
  <text start="259.58" dur="5.65">the central bankers the private western</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="5.76">central bankers cannot come to an</text>
  <text start="265.23" dur="5.82">agreement we see that Greece has already</text>
  <text start="268.35" dur="5.55">signed the deal with Russia and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="5.39">looking to submit an application with</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="6.78">the BRICS they&amp;#39;re already implementing</text>
  <text start="276.44" dur="6.19">discussions and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="4.74">about all of this and we reported on</text>
  <text start="282.63" dur="5.67">this yesterday is that the protests</text>
  <text start="285.42" dur="6.18">started in Greece the pro austerity</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="4.89">protests we want more debt we want less</text>
  <text start="291.6" dur="2.849">jobs I mean just think about what</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="4.469">they&amp;#39;re protesting here</text>
  <text start="294.449" dur="5.041">and then we come to find out from</text>
  <text start="297.659" dur="4.831">Greece&amp;#39;s former representative to the</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="5.37">IMF when he was testifying in front of a</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="4.38">special Parliamentary Committee on the</text>
  <text start="304.86" dur="5.369">Greek debt said that several Greek</text>
  <text start="306.87" dur="5.43">journalists were trained in Washington</text>
  <text start="310.229" dur="4.8">DC in order to support the position of</text>
  <text start="312.3" dur="6.989">the IMF and the European Commission in</text>
  <text start="315.029" dur="5.581">the Greek media Parliament president and</text>
  <text start="319.289" dur="2.94">head of the committee noted that the</text>
  <text start="320.61" dur="3.54">committee investigated Greece&amp;#39;s debt</text>
  <text start="322.229" dur="3.69">would seek to discover the names of the</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="7.109">journalists that took part in</text>
  <text start="325.919" dur="7.59">Washington&amp;#39;s training sessions certain</text>
  <text start="331.259" dur="5.34">individual who worked for the mass media</text>
  <text start="333.509" dur="7.46">were contracted to conceal the fact that</text>
  <text start="336.599" dur="7.35">the Greek debt was completely</text>
  <text start="340.969" dur="6.19">sustainable that they&amp;#39;d be able to do it</text>
  <text start="343.949" dur="5.041">more debt is good and when we</text>
  <text start="347.159" dur="4.921">continually look at this and we made</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="4.979">many many examples to how debt cannot be</text>
  <text start="352.08" dur="4.139">sustained we&amp;#39;ve been talking about how</text>
  <text start="353.969" dur="3.57">it can&amp;#39;t be sustained but of course we</text>
  <text start="356.219" dur="4.23">see the protests out there right now</text>
  <text start="357.539" dur="6.21">saying we want more debt we want more</text>
  <text start="360.449" dur="5.46">austerity we want less jobs because this</text>
  <text start="363.749" dur="5.7">is basically what they&amp;#39;re saying put us</text>
  <text start="365.909" dur="6.6">out of work give us more debt and again</text>
  <text start="369.449" dur="5.31">these protests make no sense the</text>
  <text start="372.509" dur="6.06">reporters who were reporting and trained</text>
  <text start="374.759" dur="6.541">on this made no sense and now it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="378.569" dur="4.741">coming out that they were trained</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="4.889">Christine Lagarde and other high</text>
  <text start="383.31" dur="4.62">officials of the IMF contacted me before</text>
  <text start="386.189" dur="4.47">my testimony before the committee to</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="6.93">remind them that the members of the IMF</text>
  <text start="390.659" dur="6.361">are immune from prosecution they went on</text>
  <text start="394.86" dur="4.349">to say that several economist and</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="4.16">university professors also attempted to</text>
  <text start="399.209" dur="4.77">convince the public that the debt was</text>
  <text start="401.18" dur="5.169">sustainable adding that he puts them in</text>
  <text start="403.979" dur="6.24">the same quarter category as the</text>
  <text start="406.349" dur="5.55">journalists so this whole thing was</text>
  <text start="410.219" dur="5.72">completely planned they brought an</text>
  <text start="411.899" dur="8.57">economist they brought in journalists</text>
  <text start="415.939" dur="7.871">they brought in university professors</text>
  <text start="420.469" dur="5.651">almost like global warming where they</text>
  <text start="423.81" dur="3.71">pay these people off they trained them</text>
  <text start="426.12" dur="3.74">to convince</text>
  <text start="427.52" dur="5.67">you that people are causing global</text>
  <text start="429.86" dur="7.47">warming it&amp;#39;s the same scam there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="433.19" dur="7.17">difference here it&amp;#39;s to meet a certain</text>
  <text start="437.33" dur="6.899">agenda and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised at</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="8.779">this point in time where the United</text>
  <text start="444.229" dur="7.981">States EU the central banking system</text>
  <text start="449.139" dur="4.81">looks at Greece and says okay we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="452.21" dur="3.51">tried everything we tried to bargain</text>
  <text start="453.949" dur="5.701">with them we can&amp;#39;t come up with an</text>
  <text start="455.72" dur="6.39">agreement we started protests we trained</text>
  <text start="459.65" dur="5.509">the Greek journalist The Economist the</text>
  <text start="462.11" dur="7.14">University Professors and they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="465.159" dur="6.221">going to leave the EU they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="469.25" dur="4.65">going to default they&amp;#39;re still going to</text>
  <text start="471.38" dur="5.219">move over to Russia and the BRIC system</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="5.85">and I would be surprised if we see some</text>
  <text start="476.599" dur="5.731">type of color revolution inside Greece</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="4.38">to get rid of the current government to</text>
  <text start="482.33" dur="4.23">bring in a puppet government now will</text>
  <text start="484.13" dur="6.17">this happened we don&amp;#39;t know but it seems</text>
  <text start="486.56" dur="7.139">like all indicators are pointing to this</text>
  <text start="490.3" dur="5.739">and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch the situation</text>
  <text start="493.699" dur="5.761">very very carefully now during this</text>
  <text start="496.039" dur="6.511">whole entire time we see the Greek</text>
  <text start="499.46" dur="4.829">people they know what&amp;#39;s coming they</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="2.85">realize that this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="504.289" dur="3.481">completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="505.4" dur="5.669">and the Greeks withdraw 1 billion</text>
  <text start="507.77" dur="7.379">dollars from the banks in a single day</text>
  <text start="511.069" dur="6.481">what does this tell you this tells you</text>
  <text start="515.149" dur="5.58">they are nervous they&amp;#39;re afraid they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.55" dur="6.51">afraid of a bank holiday the same thing</text>
  <text start="520.729" dur="6.121">that happened in Cyprus and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.06" dur="6.719">starting to get some information that</text>
  <text start="526.85" dur="5.19">the top four banks in Greece leading one</text>
  <text start="530.779" dur="5.011">of them is the National Bank of Greece</text>
  <text start="532.04" dur="6.39">the Alpha Bank the Euro bank they hold</text>
  <text start="535.79" dur="5.359">about 91% of Greek banking assets and</text>
  <text start="538.43" dur="7.529">they&amp;#39;ve already been bailed out twice</text>
  <text start="541.149" dur="9.521">but there is a real possibility they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="545.959" dur="6.87">fold not just Greece but the entire</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="3.81">banking system in Greece and this is</text>
  <text start="552.829" dur="6.51">coming from Fitch managing director</text>
  <text start="554.48" dur="6.04">James long-stem and we are also getting</text>
  <text start="559.339" dur="4.901">information that</text>
  <text start="560.52" dur="7.89">there might be a bank holiday and the</text>
  <text start="564.24" dur="8.27">banks might not reopen on Monday the</text>
  <text start="568.41" dur="7.8">banks would close down this weekend and</text>
  <text start="572.51" dur="4.93">they&amp;#39;ll remain closed on Monday maybe a</text>
  <text start="576.21" dur="2.73">couple days now I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="577.44" dur="4.56">going to happen this weekend it might</text>
  <text start="578.94" dur="5.94">happen next weekend and once they reopen</text>
  <text start="582" dur="6.54">there will be strict capital controls</text>
  <text start="584.88" dur="7.05">which would prevent any of the other</text>
  <text start="588.54" dur="4.86">deposits leaving the bank now we saw</text>
  <text start="591.93" dur="4.23">this in Cyprus where the people went to</text>
  <text start="593.4" dur="3.78">sleep on Friday they woke up and all of</text>
  <text start="596.16" dur="3.75">a sudden they couldn&amp;#39;t take their money</text>
  <text start="597.18" dur="4.8">out and this went on for longer than a</text>
  <text start="599.91" dur="3.99">year their money was stuck in the bank</text>
  <text start="601.98" dur="4.86">and the banksters</text>
  <text start="603.9" dur="5.34">robbed them of their money they took</text>
  <text start="606.84" dur="6.06">their money and they replaced it with</text>
  <text start="609.24" dur="5.64">worthless Bank stock because the banks</text>
  <text start="612.9" dur="3.99">were failing they had nothing to give</text>
  <text start="614.88" dur="5.16">them so now they&amp;#39;re stuck with worthless</text>
  <text start="616.89" dur="3.99">bank stocks in their accounts and of</text>
  <text start="620.04" dur="3.6">course what are you going to do with</text>
  <text start="620.88" dur="5.4">them nothing and they ended up taking</text>
  <text start="623.64" dur="5.79">about 47 percent of their money and we</text>
  <text start="626.28" dur="7.98">see the same thing is going to happen in</text>
  <text start="629.43" dur="9.39">Greece and again we realize that the EU</text>
  <text start="634.26" dur="8.19">the United States England Canada New</text>
  <text start="638.82" dur="6.9">Zealand and many other countries have</text>
  <text start="642.45" dur="5.25">created these bailing documents now the</text>
  <text start="645.72" dur="4.11">beylin documents alone they don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="647.7" dur="4.02">say oh here&amp;#39;s the bail and document and</text>
  <text start="649.83" dur="4.2">we can just close the banks they use</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="6">them to support their case this is why</text>
  <text start="654.03" dur="5.19">they create them so they can say oh we</text>
  <text start="657.72" dur="4.62">cannot be bailed out by the government</text>
  <text start="659.22" dur="5.67">our only alternative and we have the</text>
  <text start="662.34" dur="5.19">document documentation to prove it we</text>
  <text start="664.89" dur="5.37">need to shut down the banks and go</text>
  <text start="667.53" dur="4.77">inward and take the people&amp;#39;s money to</text>
  <text start="670.26" dur="3.81">keep the banks solvent they produce the</text>
  <text start="672.3" dur="4.71">documents and they say okay everything</text>
  <text start="674.07" dur="6.66">is legal here they can do this and this</text>
  <text start="677.01" dur="7.62">is what we are seeing right now now here</text>
  <text start="680.73" dur="7.68">in the United States the economy is</text>
  <text start="684.63" dur="7.46">completely falling apart declining and</text>
  <text start="688.41" dur="5.529">we are seeing more and more signs that</text>
  <text start="692.09" dur="3.919">the economy</text>
  <text start="693.939" dur="4.92">cannot support itself anymore these</text>
  <text start="696.009" dur="4.65">illusionary fake phony numbers that the</text>
  <text start="698.859" dur="3.96">government continually puts out they</text>
  <text start="700.659" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t even make sense anymore</text>
  <text start="702.819" dur="4.89">why are all these companies laying off</text>
  <text start="705.609" dur="4.83">all these people if the unemployment</text>
  <text start="707.709" dur="5.13">rate continually comes down if they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1390.67" dur="4.89">Russia because again they owe Russia</text>
  <text start="1393.55" dur="4.17">about three billion dollars and they</text>
  <text start="1395.56" dur="5.22">have a payment coming up very very soon</text>
  <text start="1397.72" dur="6.27">of about seventy five million and right</text>
  <text start="1400.78" dur="6.24">now Ukraine says yes we will pay the</text>
  <text start="1403.99" dur="5.46">seventy five million our payment we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1407.02" dur="6.36">ready to do this and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch</text>
  <text start="1409.45" dur="6.09">this as June 22nd approaches to see if</text>
  <text start="1413.38" dur="4.32">they actually do make the payment</text>
  <text start="1415.54" dur="5.07">because they could invoke the</text>
  <text start="1417.7" dur="5.16">legislation that says uh this debt was</text>
  <text start="1420.61" dur="4.92">created in a certain way and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1422.86" dur="4.02">criminal and Ukraine does not have to</text>
  <text start="1425.53" dur="5.49">pay this because this is what the bill</text>
  <text start="1426.88" dur="6.69">says we see the EU governments have</text>
  <text start="1431.02" dur="6.32">extended for a year a ban on trade and</text>
  <text start="1433.57" dur="3.77">investment with Crimea on Friday</text>
  <text start="1438.39" dur="5.83">meaning the European help for Russian</text>
  <text start="1442.12" dur="4.32">Black Sea oil and gas exploration and</text>
  <text start="1444.22" dur="4.8">visits by European cruise ships will</text>
  <text start="1446.44" dur="5.52">remain outlawed the measures were</text>
  <text start="1449.02" dur="6.66">adopted following Russia&amp;#39;s annexation of</text>
  <text start="1451.96" dur="7.26">Crimea and they don&amp;#39;t recognize that</text>
  <text start="1455.68" dur="7.13">Russia owns Crimea right now and these</text>
  <text start="1459.22" dur="7.92">new measures will extend until June 23rd</text>
  <text start="1462.81" dur="9.34">2016 and the ban includes importing</text>
  <text start="1467.14" dur="8.13">products made in Crimea into the EU we</text>
  <text start="1472.15" dur="5.91">see Ukraine Yatsenyuk to be specific is</text>
  <text start="1475.27" dur="7.68">out there saying that we need a secure</text>
  <text start="1478.06" dur="9.3">IT and mobile network he is saying this</text>
  <text start="1482.95" dur="8.03">because when they were fighting the</text>
  <text start="1487.36" dur="6.09">southeastern people during one of the</text>
  <text start="1490.98" dur="3.549">full-scale military conflicts</text>
  <text start="1493.45" dur="2.819">and of course they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s with</text>
  <text start="1494.529" dur="3.811">Russia but it was really with these</text>
  <text start="1496.269" dur="5.461">South Eastern people their</text>
  <text start="1498.34" dur="7.62">communications were wide open and this</text>
  <text start="1501.73" dur="6.12">is the reason why they lost against the</text>
  <text start="1505.96" dur="4.469">South Eastern people or they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1507.85" dur="4.169">make any gains in the southeastern</text>
  <text start="1510.429" dur="6.271">region so today what they want to do is</text>
  <text start="1512.019" dur="7.441">they want to create a new secure IT</text>
  <text start="1516.7" dur="5.819">mobile network and this is going to cost</text>
  <text start="1519.46" dur="6.329">1 billion u.s. dollars and they want</text>
  <text start="1522.519" dur="5.821">this up and running as soon as possible</text>
  <text start="1525.789" dur="5.61">and this way they can secure</text>
  <text start="1528.34" dur="6.299">communications among its combat units</text>
  <text start="1531.399" dur="5.25">and it will make it a lot easier when we</text>
  <text start="1534.639" dur="3.721">start this major offensive so everything</text>
  <text start="1536.649" dur="3.931">that we&amp;#39;re seeing right now it seems</text>
  <text start="1538.36" dur="4.59">that they are definitely leading up to a</text>
  <text start="1540.58" dur="5.459">major offensive getting everything in</text>

  <text start="1549.58" dur="3.719">is all coming together all the pieces</text>
  <text start="1551.529" dur="3.571">are starting to fit and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="1553.299" dur="6.12">to realize that yes this is where we are</text>
  <text start="1555.1" dur="7.61">headed now the United States government</text>
  <text start="1559.419" dur="7.23">central bankers they continually give</text>

  <text start="1569.2" dur="4.53">you must do this or else</text>
  <text start="1571.6" dur="3.27">and right now Putin is out there and</text>
  <text start="1573.73" dur="3.48">he&amp;#39;s saying that the United States is</text>

  <text start="1599.38" dur="4.649">what they need to do at this time this</text>
  <text start="1603.309" dur="6.35">is what they did</text>
  <text start="1604.029" dur="8.731">in Libya Yemen Lebanon Iraq Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="1609.659" dur="5.321">many other countries and Russia saying</text>
  <text start="1612.76" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;re not going to do this to us right</text>
  <text start="1614.98" dur="5.819">now we will decide what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1617.08" dur="6.93">do we understand that Russia continually</text>
  <text start="1620.799" dur="5.1">has the food ban with Europe and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1624.01" dur="2.88">not going to be adding any more food to</text>

  <text start="1674.53" dur="6.06">openness this is not a fine catchphrase</text>
  <text start="1677.62" dur="4.77">but the content of our real policy of</text>

  <text start="1717.3" dur="6.03">they don&amp;#39;t have countries on the same</text>
  <text start="1720.61" dur="5.34">playing field they want to dictate what</text>
  <text start="1723.33" dur="5.29">they want done because this is what</text>
  <text start="1725.95" dur="6.06">happens when an entire system is</text>

  <text start="1743.65" dur="6.51">force and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1747.04" dur="5.91">seeing now we understand that Russia and</text>
  <text start="1750.16" dur="7.05">the United States they have a treaty</text>
  <text start="1752.95" dur="7.59">between them the ABM Treaty and it was</text>
  <text start="1757.21" dur="5.55">created to avoid a strategic imbalance</text>

  <text start="1777.46" dur="3.27">significantly expanded the development</text>

  <text start="1806.59" dur="6.99">treaties they are placing ballistic</text>
  <text start="1808.99" dur="7.62">missiles in Eastern Europe and there are</text>
  <text start="1813.58" dur="4.83">more on the way and you know what Russia</text>
  <text start="1816.61" dur="3.51">is going to do to respond to this they</text>
  <text start="1818.41" dur="3.42">have to protect themselves so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1820.12" dur="5.04">going to set up their own missile system</text>
  <text start="1821.83" dur="4.86">but who is initiating all of this it is</text>
  <text start="1825.16" dur="2.91">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="1826.69" dur="3.72">bankers but of course when it comes out</text>
  <text start="1828.07" dur="6.63">the corporate media all you will see is</text>
  <text start="1830.41" dur="6.3">that Russia or China are putting</text>
  <text start="1834.7" dur="5.73">missiles pointing to the United States</text>
  <text start="1836.71" dur="5.97">they will not talk about how the United</text>
  <text start="1840.43" dur="5.64">States put them there first pointing</text>
  <text start="1842.68" dur="7.14">towards Russia and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="1846.07" dur="7.4">huge problem and we see other countries</text>
  <text start="1849.82" dur="7.17">building up their armed forces Canada is</text>
  <text start="1853.47" dur="5.43">actually building up their military at</text>
  <text start="1856.99" dur="4.47">this point</text>
  <text start="1858.9" dur="6.01">Canada has made it drastically harder to</text>
  <text start="1861.46" dur="8.97">apply for citizenship and it seems that</text>
  <text start="1864.91" dur="10.23">Canada right now is trying to build up</text>
  <text start="1870.43" dur="7.89">their military all of a sudden they are</text>
  <text start="1875.14" dur="5.22">now creating a fast-track if you serve</text>

  <text start="1882.72" dur="5.76">Canada never beefed up its military this</text>
  <text start="1885.49" dur="6.96">is a clearly total change in direction</text>

  <text start="2098.369" dur="7.691">well today Saudi Arabia&amp;#39;s up to the same</text>

  <text start="2157.32" dur="5.01">or a pressure tool that could be</text>
  <text start="2159.3" dur="4.92">switched on and off so this is very</text>
  <text start="2162.33" dur="4.68">interesting that they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
  <text start="2164.22" dur="6.24">tactic once again we saw what happened</text>
  <text start="2167.01" dur="4.95">before this happened during the summer</text>
  <text start="2170.46" dur="4.8">months and here we are in the summer</text>
  <text start="2171.96" dur="7.89">months once again we see John Kerry is</text>
  <text start="2175.26" dur="6.69">out there pushing the chemical attacks</text>

  <text start="2191.64" dur="4.92">Putin to step aside to go after Assad</text>
  <text start="2194.61" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing occur</text>
  <text start="2196.56" dur="5.91">because they are getting ready for a</text>
  <text start="2198.39" dur="6.45">major offensive now we see the FBI</text>
  <text start="2202.47" dur="4.86">director James Comey he is out there</text>
  <text start="2204.84" dur="4.74">once again saying that there are</text>
  <text start="2207.33" dur="4.32">thousands of people in the United States</text>
  <text start="2209.58" dur="4.44">joining the Islamic state we just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2211.65" dur="3.93">control them and they&amp;#39;re all joining</text>
  <text start="2214.02" dur="3.6">because of social media and we just</text>
  <text start="2215.58" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t have the ability because of all</text>
  <text start="2217.62" dur="4.58">this encryption once again and we can</text>
  <text start="2220.32" dur="4.74">see this is not about the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="2222.2" dur="5.76">this is not about people joining the</text>
  <text start="2225.06" dur="6.09">Islamic state this is about encryption</text>
  <text start="2227.96" dur="4.33">because they want to spy on the American</text>
  <text start="2231.15" dur="3.35">people and they don&amp;#39;t want people using</text>
  <text start="2232.29" dur="4.08">an encryption they don&amp;#39;t want companies</text>
  <text start="2234.5" dur="4.3">implementing encryption where they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2236.37" dur="3.78">have the method and the key and this is</text>
  <text start="2238.8" dur="4.23">why they&amp;#39;re continually making the case</text>
  <text start="2240.15" dur="4.8">and trying to show that thousands upon</text>
  <text start="2243.03" dur="4.08">thousands of people aren&amp;#39;t Twitter and</text>
  <text start="2244.95" dur="3.9">other social media accounts and other</text>

  <text start="2248.85" dur="5.46">us from spying on them and we can&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="2250.95" dur="6.21">it there&amp;#39;s just no way well this is the</text>
  <text start="2254.31" dur="4.32">way it needs to be because they should</text>
  <text start="2257.16" dur="4.71">have no right to spy on the American</text>
  <text start="2258.63" dur="5.61">people and out of all the cases that we</text>
  <text start="2261.87" dur="6.93">see all these people join the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2264.24" dur="8.61">state it&amp;#39;s because the FBI set the</text>
  <text start="2268.8" dur="6.6">patsies up they set them up they push</text>
  <text start="2272.85" dur="6">them maneuver them into doing things and</text>
  <text start="2275.4" dur="6.29">they always find those people who maybe</text>
  <text start="2278.85" dur="6.99">were in jail they have a criminal record</text>
  <text start="2281.69" dur="7.48">have a drug problem and they always find</text>
  <text start="2285.84" dur="5">these people to convince them to do</text>
  <text start="2289.17" dur="5.15">things they normally wouldn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="2290.84" dur="5.1">and they orchestrate all of it and every</text>
  <text start="2294.32" dur="2.82">time the evidence comes out most of</text>
  <text start="2295.94" dur="3.39">these cases are completely dropped</text>
  <text start="2297.14" dur="6.21">because they have no proof they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2299.33" dur="5.61">do anything and again if somebody is</text>
  <text start="2303.35" dur="3.45">looking if you believe them is looking</text>
  <text start="2304.94" dur="3.51">at the Islamic state it doesn&amp;#39;t mean you</text>
  <text start="2306.8" dur="3.96">can arrest them they didn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="2308.45" dur="5.28">but again as we know this is a proxy</text>
  <text start="2310.76" dur="5.22">army and this is really a way of trying</text>
  <text start="2313.73" dur="3.87">to convince everyone that this is going</text>
  <text start="2315.98" dur="4.59">to be a major problem now everyone needs</text>
  <text start="2317.6" dur="5.19">to protect themselves by using their own</text>
  <text start="2320.57" dur="4.92">encryption or using encryption methods</text>
  <text start="2322.79" dur="4.86">or using other products I mean block it</text>
  <text start="2325.49" dur="4.08">pocket is one where it&amp;#39;s a little sleeve</text>
  <text start="2327.65" dur="3.51">you can slip your phone into it they</text>
  <text start="2329.57" dur="3.72">won&amp;#39;t track you because it blocks the</text>
  <text start="2331.16" dur="6.6">signal because the materials interwoven</text>
  <text start="2333.29" dur="6.57">with copper stainless steel silver and</text>
  <text start="2337.76" dur="3.96">it blocks the signal also has another</text>
  <text start="2339.86" dur="3.75">benefit where it blocks the radiation</text>
  <text start="2341.72" dur="4.26">from going into your head because as we</text>
  <text start="2343.61" dur="4.23">know these cellphones do admit radiation</text>
  <text start="2345.98" dur="2.82">and you can find that unblocked at</text>
  <text start="2347.84" dur="2.67">pocket can they have many different</text>
  <text start="2348.8" dur="3.09">things on there one of them which is</text>
  <text start="2350.51" dur="4.05">very nice is that you can slip your</text>
  <text start="2351.89" dur="5.25">credit cards into them and it blocks the</text>
  <text start="2354.56" dur="5.4">signal so when you walk by people that</text>
  <text start="2357.14" dur="4.47">have these transmitters they aren&amp;#39;t able</text>
  <text start="2359.96" dur="4.77">to steal the information off the chip</text>
  <text start="2361.61" dur="4.95">because each one of these credit cards</text>
  <text start="2364.73" dur="4.68">now we&amp;#39;re debit cards are going to have</text>
  <text start="2366.56" dur="5.13">these chips and it will block the signal</text>
  <text start="2369.41" dur="6.87">so they can&amp;#39;t get to it and this will</text>
  <text start="2371.69" dur="8.13">also help you because when the license</text>
  <text start="2376.28" dur="6.36">come out with the RFID chip it will also</text>
  <text start="2379.82" dur="4.17">block that signal so they can&amp;#39;t track</text>
  <text start="2382.64" dur="3.3">you and they won&amp;#39;t know where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2383.99" dur="3.93">going so it is actually beneficial to</text>
  <text start="2385.94" dur="3.72">have something like this because again</text>
  <text start="2387.92" dur="4.74">we have to make we have to take matters</text>
  <text start="2389.66" dur="6.12">into our own hand because just like you</text>
  <text start="2392.66" dur="6.15">lock up your jewelry just like you lock</text>
  <text start="2395.78" dur="6.15">up your home just like you secure your</text>
  <text start="2398.81" dur="4.62">mail you seal your envelope you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2401.93" dur="5.25">leave it open when you send the mail you</text>
  <text start="2403.43" dur="5.58">seal it because you want privacy the</text>
  <text start="2407.18" dur="3.75">same thing has to go with your email the</text>
  <text start="2409.01" dur="4.47">same thing has to go with your tweets</text>
  <text start="2410.93" dur="5.67">the same thing has to go with your text</text>
  <text start="2413.48" dur="4.86">and the information on your computer and</text>
  <text start="2416.6" dur="2.89">you want to keep things secure you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2418.34" dur="3.73">want to be tracked</text>
  <text start="2419.49" dur="5.43">and I think we all want the same thing</text>
  <text start="2422.07" dur="6.42">we want privacy and their founding</text>
  <text start="2424.92" dur="8.28">fathers wanted all of us to have privacy</text>
  <text start="2428.49" dur="6.33">and this is why they made this into the</text>
  <text start="2433.2" dur="4.77">framework of the Bill of Rights in the</text>
  <text start="2434.82" dur="5.94">Constitution so we can have privacy so</text>
  <text start="2437.97" dur="4.5">we have certain freedoms Oh separate and</text>
  <text start="2440.76" dur="4.23">apart from the government where they</text>
  <text start="2442.47" dur="4.44">cannot just come into our homes where</text>
  <text start="2444.99" dur="6.42">they just can&amp;#39;t spy on our personal</text>
  <text start="2446.91" dur="7.74">information now out in Charleston we see</text>
  <text start="2451.41" dur="5.66">the corporate media&amp;#39;s out there they are</text>
  <text start="2454.65" dur="5.16">pushing gun control they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="2457.07" dur="7.54">everything they possibly can hate crime</text>
  <text start="2459.81" dur="6.96">raesha s-- uh this is our erase crime</text>
  <text start="2464.61" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s race Wars that are building up</text>
  <text start="2466.77" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they can to push</text>
  <text start="2469.74" dur="4.83">their agenda now there&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="2472.74" dur="4.92">agendas associated with this as we know</text>
  <text start="2474.57" dur="5.97">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="2477.66" dur="7.91">all these mass shootings seem to have</text>
  <text start="2480.54" dur="8.72">something in common that these</text>
  <text start="2485.57" dur="7.48">individuals are on some type of</text>

  <text start="2493.05" dur="5.46">prozac or any other type of medication I</text>
  <text start="2496.47" dur="5.81">mean if we look throughout history like</text>
  <text start="2498.51" dur="9.24">Jeff Weiss age 16 he was to prescribed</text>
  <text start="2502.28" dur="7.72">60 milligrams of Prozac and he shot his</text>
  <text start="2507.75" dur="6.93">grandfather and his grandfather</text>
  <text start="2510" dur="7.109">girlfriend and then he shot himself so</text>
  <text start="2514.68" dur="5.04">they were ended up that being 10 dead 12</text>
  <text start="2517.109" dur="7.26">wounded after he was done we see Corey</text>

  <text start="2535.83" dur="4.59">no memory of the event chris fetters</text>
  <text start="2538.17" dur="3.56">aged 13 killed his favorite aunt while</text>
  <text start="2540.42" dur="3.75">taking Prozac</text>
  <text start="2541.73" dur="4.33">Christopher Pittman age 12 murdered both</text>
  <text start="2544.17" dur="6.27">his grandparents while taking Zoloft and</text>
  <text start="2546.06" dur="7.08">it goes on and on and on and we see this</text>
  <text start="2550.44" dur="6.089">Charleston shooter</text>
  <text start="2553.14" dur="7.34">Dylann roof he was arrested February</text>
  <text start="2556.529" dur="6.921">28th in a mall and he was at the time</text>
  <text start="2560.48" dur="8.619">taking a medication called I&amp;#39;ll save a</text>
  <text start="2563.45" dur="12.03">suboxone and this was to treat an opiate</text>

  <text start="2577.19" dur="8.379">agitation hostility hallucinations</text>
  <text start="2581.48" dur="9.43">suicide tendencies and when you withdraw</text>
  <text start="2585.569" dur="7.351">from this drug guess what there is rage</text>
  <text start="2590.91" dur="4.139">there&amp;#39;s things you do that you normally</text>
  <text start="2592.92" dur="7.169">wouldn&amp;#39;t do and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="2595.049" dur="7.8">that a lot of these instances all lead</text>
  <text start="2600.089" dur="4.081">back to these type of medications now</text>
  <text start="2602.849" dur="4.2">this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the government</text>
  <text start="2604.17" dur="5.099">didn&amp;#39;t step in and persuade this person</text>
  <text start="2607.049" dur="4.74">because they normally go to those people</text>
  <text start="2609.269" dur="5.461">that are on these type of drugs because</text>
  <text start="2611.789" dur="5.76">they are mentally impaired in some way</text>
  <text start="2614.73" dur="5.01">and they need these drugs to get by</text>
  <text start="2617.549" dur="5.601">everyday they understand that he was</text>
  <text start="2619.74" dur="6.51">arrested before they knew who he was and</text>
  <text start="2623.15" dur="8.5">this he might have been pushed to do</text>
  <text start="2626.25" dur="6.509">something to push certain agendas and</text>
  <text start="2631.65" dur="3.78">this is what we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="2632.759" dur="7.951">because all of this makes no sense in</text>
  <text start="2635.43" dur="10.02">what he did in a an everyday person will</text>
  <text start="2640.71" dur="7.069">not follow these steps and what he said</text>
  <text start="2645.45" dur="7.71">in the church seems a little scripted</text>
  <text start="2647.779" dur="8.711">his facebook was like set up this year</text>
  <text start="2653.16" dur="6.119">and a lot of the followers were not all</text>
  <text start="2656.49" dur="4.859">white a lot of them were of many</text>
  <text start="2659.279" dur="2.701">different backgrounds so that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2661.349" dur="3">make sense</text>
  <text start="2661.98" dur="6.839">he had like two entries in his facebook</text>
  <text start="2664.349" dur="8.311">and a lot of this that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="2668.819" dur="6.061">right now is to push certain agendas and</text>
  <text start="2672.66" dur="3.389">of course as soon as this was ended the</text>
  <text start="2674.88" dur="3.87">president came out and he was looking</text>
  <text start="2676.049" dur="5.07">for gun control he&amp;#39;s saying that when</text>
  <text start="2678.75" dur="5.91">this needs to be stopped and again the</text>
  <text start="2681.119" dur="6.051">person went into a church and under the</text>
  <text start="2684.66" dur="6.92">South Carolina South Carolina law</text>
  <text start="2687.17" dur="6.82">weapons are not permitted unless the</text>
  <text start="2691.58" dur="4">establishment gives permission so he</text>
  <text start="2693.99" dur="6.24">knew there would be no weapons in this</text>
  <text start="2695.58" dur="7.35">church it&amp;#39;s very convenient and we see</text>
  <text start="2700.23" dur="5.34">that this is always being used for</text>
  <text start="2702.93" dur="7.86">certain agendas and the president was</text>
  <text start="2705.57" dur="9.66">out there saying that this is a terrible</text>
  <text start="2710.79" dur="6.78">horrific event which it is I mean this</text>
  <text start="2715.23" dur="3.84">is terrible that people do die in even</text>
  <text start="2717.57" dur="4.26">if there is a false flag you have to</text>
  <text start="2719.07" dur="6.93">remember people will die in a false flag</text>
  <text start="2721.83" dur="11.99">they&amp;#39;re not all actors people will get</text>
  <text start="2726" dur="13.23">hurt and we see that almost all of these</text>
  <text start="2733.82" dur="8.62">events occur in gun-free areas very</text>
  <text start="2739.23" dur="6.32">interesting and he&amp;#39;s saying that you</text>
  <text start="2742.44" dur="6.48">know we need to implement more gun laws</text>
  <text start="2745.55" dur="5.14">we need to stop this from happening that</text>
  <text start="2748.92" dur="4.5">people with guns are not going to stop</text>
  <text start="2750.69" dur="5.82">this well he&amp;#39;s actually not correct with</text>
