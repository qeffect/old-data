  <text start="36.9" dur="4.02">this episode is Russia and China look in</text>
  <text start="38.79" dur="5.699">to conduct half of their trade in you</text>
  <text start="40.92" dur="5.639">wan or rubles and we can see that Russia</text>
  <text start="44.489" dur="4.081">and China are definitely pushing this as</text>
  <text start="46.559" dur="3.96">hard as they possibly can because they</text>
  <text start="48.57" dur="3.659">realize after what happened in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="50.519" dur="5.61">where the United States is provoking</text>
  <text start="52.229" dur="6.661">Russia into war they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="56.129" dur="5.61">placing sanctions on Russia pretty much</text>
  <text start="58.89" dur="5.519">blaming everything on Russia and Russia</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="5.071">and China at the BRIC nations decided at</text>
  <text start="64.409" dur="5.341">this point they need to be separate and</text>
  <text start="66.81" dur="4.949">apart from the United States central</text>
  <text start="69.75" dur="4.439">bankers and they created their own Bank</text>
  <text start="71.759" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re bringing in more nations into</text>
  <text start="74.189" dur="5.311">the brick regime here Russia and China</text>
  <text start="77.549" dur="4.441">are making more and more deals together</text>
  <text start="79.5" dur="4.5">by passing the dollar they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="4.169">d dollar izing and we understand that</text>
  <text start="84" dur="5.369">like Switzerland UK New Zealand</text>
  <text start="86.159" dur="6.39">Australia Argentina now and many other</text>
  <text start="89.369" dur="6.24">countries have already set up bilateral</text>
  <text start="92.549" dur="5.88">trade agreements to completely bypass</text>
  <text start="95.609" dur="4.591">the US dollar everyone is protecting</text>
  <text start="98.429" dur="4.771">themselves because they realize the</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="6.659">dollar is coming down and we see as more</text>
  <text start="103.2" dur="5.37">and where this happens the central</text>
  <text start="106.859" dur="3.75">bankers the US government government</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="5.13">become more and more desperate we see in</text>

  <text start="113.7" dur="5.61">footprint in China we have Kenya is a</text>
  <text start="117.03" dur="4.53">clearinghouse for the you won most of</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="5.309">the African nations are removing the</text>
  <text start="121.56" dur="4.949">dollar adding the yuan remember and we</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="3.541">can see that United States does not want</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="3.571">this to happen they want the natural</text>
  <text start="128.16" dur="4.56">resources they want the military force</text>
  <text start="130.08" dur="6.18">down there and they don&amp;#39;t want China in</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="6.45">this area and we can see by a Chinese</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="4.68">think tank when they came out with a</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="5.88">report saying yes the</text>
  <text start="140.94" dur="6.63">stasis and circling Africa to keep China</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="5.1">out of that area they also said that the</text>
  <text start="147.57" dur="4.89">United States is encircling China in the</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="4.47">Pacific to contain them and this is a</text>
  <text start="152.46" dur="4.68">known fact because Obama was out there</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="6.18">saying yes we are going to contain China</text>
  <text start="157.14" dur="5.61">in this area we see in the European area</text>
  <text start="160.8" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact thing and</text>
  <text start="162.75" dur="5.13">military assets are being moved all over</text>
  <text start="164.85" dur="5.61">the world right now in preparation for</text>
  <text start="167.88" dur="4.32">the next war and this is what United</text>
  <text start="170.46" dur="4.98">States central bankers have been pushing</text>
  <text start="172.2" dur="5.43">for and we are on the cusp of going to</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="4.11">war we can see right now the United</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="3.72">States is getting together many</text>
  <text start="179.55" dur="5.04">different nations I think it&amp;#39;s 40 plus</text>
  <text start="181.35" dur="5.85">now in the coalition to go into Iraq and</text>
  <text start="184.59" dur="4.65">of course just skip on over to Syria but</text>
  <text start="187.2" dur="5.01">the this again is going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="189.24" dur="5.52">huge problem because Syria is a</text>
  <text start="192.21" dur="4.26">sovereign nation Syria has been giving</text>
  <text start="194.76" dur="3.54">warning saying you cannot just come in</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="4.14">here in bama&amp;#39;s of course the United</text>
  <text start="198.3" dur="4.62">States is saying yes we can bomb any</text>
  <text start="200.61" dur="4.32">place we want a bomb and nobody can tell</text>
  <text start="202.92" dur="4.2">us any different Russia is giving the</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="4.05">warning saying please you cannot go in</text>
  <text start="207.12" dur="4.11">here it will be against international</text>
  <text start="208.98" dur="4.229">law and you know exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="4.68">going to do there they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="213.209" dur="5.791">either just go ahead and do it because</text>
  <text start="215.91" dur="6.24">Obama has a pen and a paper or they will</text>
  <text start="219" dur="5.489">have this special event which will say</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="5.85">now the Islamic state has attacked us</text>
  <text start="224.489" dur="5.811">they were joined up with Syria and we</text>
  <text start="228" dur="6.36">also have to understand that they are</text>
  <text start="230.3" dur="7.17">doing this completely on purpose none of</text>
  <text start="234.36" dur="6.33">this is a coincidence none of this is</text>
  <text start="237.47" dur="5.89">out of the blue they all knew this was</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="4.32">coming this whole thing is scripted they</text>
  <text start="243.36" dur="3.96">knew exactly what was going to happen</text>
  <text start="245.01" dur="6.87">they knew exactly that they were have to</text>
  <text start="247.32" dur="7.62">have to go to war I mean I back in 2013</text>
  <text start="251.88" dur="5.46">even before that I was talking about</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="5.28">moving military assets all over the</text>
  <text start="257.34" dur="5.7">world preparing for World War three and</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="5.37">we can see now as time went on all</text>
  <text start="263.04" dur="4.32">throughout this time period we can see</text>
  <text start="265.59" dur="4.5">we are definitely headed in this</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="5.4">situation because they realize the</text>
  <text start="270.09" dur="4.199">economy is completely falling apart the</text>
  <text start="272.76" dur="4.17">dollar is collapsing the</text>
  <text start="274.289" dur="4.891">Rick nations are making more and more</text>
  <text start="276.93" dur="4.979">deals around the world China has been</text>
  <text start="279.18" dur="4.739">making bilateral deals all across the</text>
  <text start="281.909" dur="4.68">globe and they&amp;#39;re continually making</text>
  <text start="283.919" dur="5.101">deals look at argentina right now I mean</text>
  <text start="286.589" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re in default but Argentina says</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="3.239">that we don&amp;#39;t care we&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="290.639" dur="4.59">over the bricks Chinese going to pump in</text>
  <text start="292.259" dur="5.19">billions of dollars we will be fine and</text>
  <text start="295.229" dur="3.81">a lot of the nations are looking this</text>
  <text start="297.449" dur="3.27">saying you know what we&amp;#39;ll just get rid</text>
  <text start="299.039" dur="4.68">of our dollars will be a lot easier that</text>
  <text start="300.719" dur="5.82">way and of course when the dollars flow</text>
  <text start="303.719" dur="5.25">back to the United States what happens</text>
  <text start="306.539" dur="4.951">the value of the dollar decreases we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.969" dur="4.081">going to see a rise in prices and we see</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="5.159">already in the Middle East with Libya</text>
  <text start="313.05" dur="6.419">Yemen Lebanon Iraq it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="316.649" dur="5.341">falling apart and once these countries</text>
  <text start="319.469" dur="5.22">start selling the oil not using the</text>
  <text start="321.99" dur="5.039">dollar you&amp;#39;re going to see everything</text>
  <text start="324.689" dur="4.56">really start to ramp up this is when the</text>
  <text start="327.029" dur="4.53">central bankers say oh no no no no just</text>
  <text start="329.249" dur="5.581">like when the tribes in Libya tried to</text>
  <text start="331.559" dur="7.2">fill up a tanker with oil sell it to</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="6.479">some other country or other entity not</text>
  <text start="338.759" dur="5.22">using the US dollar of course the SEAL</text>
  <text start="341.309" dur="4.98">team was on that tanker in no time flat</text>
  <text start="343.979" dur="4.11">and brought it right back because they</text>
  <text start="346.289" dur="4.35">do not want any of this out they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="348.089" dur="5.341">using the US dollar let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="350.639" dur="5.37">economic collapse news now we understand</text>
  <text start="353.43" dur="4.65">here in the States things are completely</text>
  <text start="356.009" dur="5.22">falling apart we see it with the bolt</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="4.739">that right index we see it with a PMI we</text>
  <text start="361.229" dur="3.15">see it with the unemployment numbers we</text>
  <text start="362.819" dur="4.58">know those are fake we see it with</text>
  <text start="364.379" dur="6.9">inflation how they&amp;#39;re shrinking products</text>
  <text start="367.399" dur="5.23">substituting ingredients some products</text>
  <text start="371.279" dur="4.5">they can&amp;#39;t do that things that are</text>
  <text start="372.629" dur="5.97">natural like apples oranges milk meat</text>
  <text start="375.779" dur="4.59">liquor those things are much harder to</text>
  <text start="378.599" dur="3.6">control and those prices are definitely</text>
  <text start="380.369" dur="3.72">going up but other products where they</text>
  <text start="382.199" dur="4.59">can shrink or give you less or</text>
  <text start="384.089" dur="6.42">substitute the ingredients they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="386.789" dur="5.52">trying to keep the the the products at</text>
  <text start="390.509" dur="4.26">the same price and no one notices that</text>
  <text start="392.309" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s inflation but when we</text>
  <text start="394.769" dur="5.52">look at the real indicators like retail</text>
  <text start="397.169" dur="5.42">sales how many stores are closing real</text>
  <text start="400.289" dur="5.55">estate which I harp on quite a bit</text>
  <text start="402.589" dur="5.171">because it is a great indicator we also</text>
  <text start="405.839" dur="4.681">see a mortgage</text>
  <text start="407.76" dur="4.53">companies laying off people we see major</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="4.8">corporations laying off people see the</text>
  <text start="412.29" dur="6.93">tech industry laying off a huge amount</text>
  <text start="415.32" dur="5.94">of people and one of the big indicators</text>
  <text start="419.22" dur="4.59">here is of course Walmart but also</text>
  <text start="421.26" dur="6.18">McDonald&amp;#39;s because this is a fast food</text>
  <text start="423.81" dur="5.4">restaurant it is pretty inexpensive in</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="4.86">terms of if you go out to eat other</text>
  <text start="429.21" dur="5.7">places and we&amp;#39;re seeing that McDonald&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.3" dur="5.25">is really not doing well McDonald&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="434.91" dur="5.07">report a global comp store sales which</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="5.07">saw a decline of three-point-seven</text>
  <text start="439.98" dur="5.7">percent from a year ago it&amp;#39;s worse</text>
  <text start="442.62" dur="5.31">monthly print in a decade this was</text>
  <text start="445.68" dur="4.71">driven in big part by the US where</text>
  <text start="447.93" dur="4.92">comparable sales decline by two point</text>
  <text start="450.39" dur="5.43">eight percent in August and have not</text>
  <text start="452.85" dur="5.61">posted a positive monthly print since</text>
  <text start="455.82" dur="5.22">December so since december of last year</text>
  <text start="458.46" dur="5.52">every single month since then has been</text>
  <text start="461.04" dur="4.74">awful and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="463.98" dur="4.41">people are like we don&amp;#39;t even have the</text>
  <text start="465.78" dur="6.24">money to go and get mcdonalds at this</text>
  <text start="468.39" dur="6.8">point now we see consumer credit is</text>
  <text start="472.02" dur="5.7">surging but where it&amp;#39;s surging is in</text>
  <text start="475.19" dur="4.39">automobile loans and student loans</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="3.6">because a lot of people who do not have</text>
  <text start="479.58" dur="4.17">jobs and of course those people who are</text>
  <text start="481.32" dur="4.74">being laid off in big companies and</text>
  <text start="483.75" dur="4.38">their severance is running out they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="486.06" dur="4.44">been sending out resumes they realize oh</text>
  <text start="488.13" dur="4.14">i mean you know i was in this job for</text>
  <text start="490.5" dur="3.12">quite a while I&amp;#39;ve lost some skills I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="492.27" dur="2.94">better go back to school because is what</text>
  <text start="493.62" dur="3.6">the government&amp;#39;s telling me to do they</text>
  <text start="495.21" dur="4.35">take out student loans they go back to</text>
  <text start="497.22" dur="5.22">school thinking that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="499.56" dur="5.01">get a better job when they get out of</text>
  <text start="502.44" dur="3.96">school and they find out still there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.57" dur="4.14">no school but now you have debt and</text>
  <text start="506.4" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re starting to see this and with the</text>
  <text start="508.71" dur="3.54">automobile loans what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="510.69" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;ve gone down to if you have a</text>
  <text start="512.25" dur="3.3">heartbeat they will give you an auto</text>
  <text start="514.14" dur="3.3">loan but this is really starting to</text>
  <text start="515.55" dur="3.84">backfire because we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="517.44" dur="5.85">delinquencies for seeing the repo man</text>
  <text start="519.39" dur="7.17">out there and the number of days that</text>
  <text start="523.29" dur="5.07">people are late is growing on it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.56" dur="4.47">getting worse but this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.36" dur="7.28">propping up the consumer credit right</text>
  <text start="531.03" dur="8.13">now and we can see that the credit card</text>
  <text start="535.64" dur="5.98">numbers aren&amp;#39;t as good as the auto and</text>
  <text start="539.16" dur="4.26">student loan numbers because people are</text>
  <text start="541.62" dur="4.59">maxed out on their credit cards they</text>
  <text start="543.42" dur="5.79">have no savings they have no job and it</text>
  <text start="546.21" dur="5.43">is very very difficult to make ends meet</text>
  <text start="549.21" dur="4.44">and as we go through this winter it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="551.64" dur="3.48">going to get worse because what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="553.65" dur="4.68">to happen those people who are trying to</text>
  <text start="555.12" dur="4.77">sell their homes trying to get money go</text>
  <text start="558.33" dur="3.72">to something a little bit smaller or</text>
  <text start="559.89" dur="3.42">something different or who&amp;#39;ve lost their</text>
  <text start="562.05" dur="2.76">job and they&amp;#39;re trying to make the</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="3.45">payments on their house they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="564.81" dur="5.13">find that they&amp;#39;re in a huge huge bind</text>
  <text start="566.76" dur="5.49">and they will not be able to get by now</text>
  <text start="569.94" dur="5.94">the World Bank is out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="572.25" dur="5.85">saying we are in a global job crisis you</text>
  <text start="575.88" dur="5.61">think let&amp;#39;s see if we look around and we</text>
  <text start="578.1" dur="6.989">look at the Western the central western</text>
  <text start="581.49" dur="6.96">bank nations like France and Italy and</text>
  <text start="585.089" dur="5.971">Cyprus and Greece and Portugal and UK</text>
  <text start="588.45" dur="5.52">and Germany United States Canada</text>
  <text start="591.06" dur="4.8">Australia everyone is a little different</text>
  <text start="593.97" dur="4.2">some are a lot worse than others but</text>
  <text start="595.86" dur="4.86">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a lot of people</text>
  <text start="598.17" dur="5.43">cannot find work unemployment is very</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="5.67">very high and right now the world is</text>
  <text start="603.6" dur="5.19">facing a global job crisis that is</text>
  <text start="606.39" dur="4.77">hurting the chances of reigniting the</text>
  <text start="608.79" dur="4.62">economic growth and there is no magic</text>
  <text start="611.16" dur="3.75">bullet to solve the problem well the</text>
  <text start="613.41" dur="4.11">magic bullet they&amp;#39;re going to use is</text>
  <text start="614.91" dur="4.35">something called war they&amp;#39;re hoping that</text>
  <text start="617.52" dur="3.99">this will cover up everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.26" dur="4.68">been going on because they realize there</text>
  <text start="621.51" dur="3.87">is no other way out of this and we can</text>
  <text start="623.94" dur="3.57">see that more and more nations are</text>
  <text start="625.38" dur="4.32">getting more and more debt which then</text>
  <text start="627.51" dur="4.53">they impose austerity which then they</text>
  <text start="629.7" dur="4.74">cut programs which then hurts small</text>
  <text start="632.04" dur="4.23">businesses those small businesses lay</text>

  <text start="921.46" dur="5.13">protect themselves from a government</text>
  <text start="924.61" dur="4.29">that is out of control and this is why</text>
  <text start="926.59" dur="3.93">they actually placed it in the Bill of</text>

  <text start="930.52" dur="2.76">course the government is out there</text>
  <text start="931.93" dur="2.94">saying it has to do with hunting and</text>
  <text start="933.28" dur="3.24">many other things but it has absolutely</text>
  <text start="934.87" dur="3.629">nothing to do with it and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="936.52" dur="4.319">continually trying to make and convince</text>
  <text start="938.499" dur="4.41">everyone that guns are bad and I did see</text>
  <text start="940.839" dur="5.7">the video of this little nine-year-old</text>
  <text start="942.909" dur="8.04">girl who was shooting this Susie with</text>
  <text start="946.539" dur="6.21">this trainer and of course it cuts off</text>
  <text start="950.949" dur="5.01">so you can&amp;#39;t see what actually happened</text>
  <text start="952.749" dur="5.46">but when I view these type of videos and</text>
  <text start="955.959" dur="4.29">like to be heading and this girl</text>
  <text start="958.209" dur="5.07">nine-year-old girl I&amp;#39;m looking at the</text>
  <text start="960.249" dur="4.62">Uzi shooting and if you haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="963.279" dur="4.26">this video just go onto YouTube it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="964.869" dur="6.84">over the place what I noticed is when</text>
  <text start="967.539" dur="7.29">she&amp;#39;s shooting the Uzi where the shell</text>
  <text start="971.709" dur="7.68">is supposed to be ejected nothing comes</text>
  <text start="974.829" dur="7.2">out of the gun now two things I know</text>
  <text start="979.389" dur="6.24">they make an airsoft model and a BB gun</text>
  <text start="982.029" dur="5.43">which simulate an Uzi and when you shoot</text>
  <text start="985.629" dur="3.81">it there are no shells that do come out</text>
  <text start="987.459" dur="4.17">of the gun whatsoever so I went to look</text>
  <text start="989.439" dur="4.98">at other Uzi videos and I noticed that</text>
  <text start="991.629" dur="5.16">yes when I&amp;#39;m watching them shoot I see a</text>
  <text start="994.419" dur="4.17">lot of smoke and I seashells just</text>
  <text start="996.789" dur="4.68">pouring out of the right side when I</text>
  <text start="998.589" dur="6.33">look at this video I see none of this</text>
  <text start="1001.469" dur="5.94">and then when I look at videos of</text>
  <text start="1004.919" dur="5.04">someone shooting an airsoft or a BB</text>
  <text start="1007.409" dur="5.22">guzzi gun of course there are no shells</text>
  <text start="1009.959" dur="4.05">because there aren&amp;#39;t any it looks like</text>
  <text start="1012.629" dur="2.97">that&amp;#39;s what she was shooting and of</text>
  <text start="1014.009" dur="4.29">course they cut it off at the perfect</text>
  <text start="1015.599" dur="4.71">moment I really would love to see the</text>
  <text start="1018.299" dur="4.59">full video but I don&amp;#39;t think it really</text>
  <text start="1020.309" dur="5.51">exists out there I think this was for</text>
  <text start="1022.889" dur="5.64">shock value to get it on all the</text>
  <text start="1025.819" dur="7.151">corporate media to convince everyone</text>
