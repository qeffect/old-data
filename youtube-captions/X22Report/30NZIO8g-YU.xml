  <text start="100.83" dur="4.89">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="103.05" dur="4.319">financial news now we understand that</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;ve been under a central banking</text>
  <text start="107.369" dur="5.911">system starting all the way back to 1913</text>
  <text start="110.4" dur="6.78">and in 1971 which we discussed many</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="5.61">times before we were taken off the gold</text>
  <text start="117.18" dur="4.32">standard now this wasn&amp;#39;t because of gold</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="3.99">speculators it wasn&amp;#39;t because oh they</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="4.26">were investors out there that were</text>
  <text start="122.88" dur="4.41">trying to manipulate the gold price it</text>
  <text start="125.76" dur="5.699">was about countries who wanted their</text>
  <text start="127.29" dur="6.39">gold back and the Fed the United States</text>
  <text start="131.459" dur="4.441">at the time deep state didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="6.47">give the gold back most likely because</text>
  <text start="135.9" dur="7.14">they leased it out or it was gone and</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="6.67">they were moving the entire economic</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="7.37">system to a petrol dollar system at this</text>
  <text start="146.82" dur="6.69">time and back then</text>
  <text start="150.41" dur="7.329">countries realized what was happening</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="6.9">because the Fed printed a lot more</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="6.291">currency the government borrowed that</text>
  <text start="160.41" dur="6.299">currency and debt was being run up</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="3.1">countries realized this and said ok wait</text>
  <text start="166.709" dur="3.291">a minute</text>
  <text start="167.13" dur="6.389">we gave you a certain amount of gold and</text>
  <text start="170" dur="7.11">you weren&amp;#39;t allowed to print more</text>
  <text start="173.519" dur="6.481">currency than there was gold and this is</text>
  <text start="177.11" dur="4.99">that this is the turning point this is</text>
  <text start="180" dur="4.769">when the countries realized something</text>
  <text start="182.1" dur="4.9">was wrong and what the central bankers</text>
  <text start="184.769" dur="5.441">did was they closed the</text>
  <text start="187" dur="7.22">golde window where countries were no</text>
  <text start="190.21" dur="8.25">longer allowed to repatriate their gold</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="6.58">at the same time and this was in an in</text>
  <text start="198.46" dur="3.9">planning stage for a very long time they</text>
  <text start="200.8" dur="3.51">were planning to move us off the gold</text>
  <text start="202.36" dur="5.94">stage and move us on to the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="6.66">system and this is why they made deals</text>
  <text start="208.3" dur="4.74">out in the Middle East where militarily</text>
  <text start="210.97" dur="9.33">we would protect certain countries like</text>
  <text start="213.04" dur="9.69">Saudi Arabia Lebanon Iraq Libya as long</text>
  <text start="220.3" dur="6.21">as they sold the the oil using the</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="6.54">dollar this was the agreement couple</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="5.13">reports ago we mentioned that Trump made</text>
  <text start="229.27" dur="5.16">an announcement to Saudi Arabia saying</text>
  <text start="231.64" dur="5.22">listen maybe you should start paying for</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="6.21">this protection now this is very</text>
  <text start="236.86" dur="6.69">interesting because the deal was going</text>
  <text start="240.64" dur="5.79">back in time with Henry Kissinger and</text>
  <text start="243.55" dur="4.71">and the central bankers that the United</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="5.61">States a deep state would protect these</text>
  <text start="248.26" dur="8.759">countries now Trump is turning this all</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="7.319">around and that is a signal every time</text>
  <text start="257.019" dur="5.131">you hear these little tidbits like the</text>
  <text start="259.359" dur="6.12">troops are coming home from Syria we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="8.22">gonna have peace in North Korea we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.479" dur="7.671">going to make a new deal with Iran Saudi</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="7.38">Arabia should pay for their protection</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="5.59">he&amp;#39;s letting the world know something is</text>
  <text start="277.75" dur="3.33">about to happen</text>
  <text start="278.74" dur="4.35">and what that really means is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="3.63">going to be doing the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="4.47">the central bank deep state has been</text>
  <text start="284.71" dur="4.68">doing for a very long time we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="3.21">get into that a little bit more but</text>
  <text start="289.39" dur="4.589">let&amp;#39;s just go through what is happening</text>
  <text start="290.77" dur="5.97">out there in the world Venezuela right</text>
  <text start="293.979" dur="5.671">now they officially launched their oil</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="5.61">back cryptocurrency this is the L petrol</text>
  <text start="299.65" dur="4.98">and they&amp;#39;re gonna be using this to sell</text>
  <text start="302.35" dur="5.79">their oil and this is going to go live</text>
  <text start="304.63" dur="5.55">November 5th and this L petrol</text>
  <text start="308.14" dur="5.22">cryptocurrency it&amp;#39;s going to be backed</text>
  <text start="310.18" dur="5.85">by oil natural gas diamonds and gold and</text>
  <text start="313.36" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this plays out of</text>
  <text start="316.03" dur="4.46">course the critics are out there saying</text>
  <text start="318.07" dur="4.219">that this is going to be a disaster</text>
  <text start="320.49" dur="3.66">currencies cannot be used in this</text>
  <text start="322.289" dur="5.011">fashion so we&amp;#39;re gonna watch the whole</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="6.389">thing go up in flames maybe maybe not</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="5.22">because we see China Russia many other</text>
  <text start="330.539" dur="5.91">countries starting to use cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="8.19">and countries out there will exchange</text>
  <text start="336.449" dur="6.81">using cryptocurrency so what this allows</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="6.299">Venezuela to do it allows them to bypass</text>
  <text start="343.259" dur="6.901">the sanctions this is a very big thing</text>
  <text start="347.009" dur="5.011">because that means that countries are</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="3.479">figuring I mean they&amp;#39;ve always figured</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="4.619">out ways and how to get around sanctions</text>
  <text start="353.639" dur="7.081">by bartering using gold and other means</text>
  <text start="356.639" dur="7.62">but this would be an electronic currency</text>
  <text start="360.72" dur="5.699">system which completely bypasses the</text>
  <text start="364.259" dur="4.771">dollar and remember Russia has been out</text>
  <text start="366.419" dur="4.68">there saying that countries should</text>
  <text start="369.03" dur="4.83">bypass the dollar they should use their</text>
  <text start="371.099" dur="4.771">national their national currencies they</text>
  <text start="373.86" dur="4.049">should use their own currencies for</text>
  <text start="375.87" dur="4.68">trade I mean Russia and China have been</text>
  <text start="377.909" dur="4.651">doing this India is doing it now we see</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="4.29">Surya is going to be doing it we see</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="3.9">many of the Middle Eastern countries are</text>
  <text start="384.84" dur="3.449">going to do it Africa the African</text>
  <text start="386.46" dur="4.739">nations saying that listen maybe we</text>
  <text start="388.289" dur="4.741">should use the yuan we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="391.199" dur="4.65">dollar because we do a lot more trade</text>
  <text start="393.03" dur="4.74">with China so this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="395.849" dur="3.961">stages and I think a lot of things are</text>
  <text start="397.77" dur="4.079">going to change I think this is going to</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="4.199">be a huge test and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="401.849" dur="4.651">this plays out here in the United States</text>
  <text start="404.009" dur="5.22">we mentioned that the retail apocalypse</text>
  <text start="406.5" dur="5.219">is continuing and what we&amp;#39;re seeing and</text>
  <text start="409.229" dur="7.021">we mentioned this that mattress firm</text>
  <text start="411.719" dur="7.741">they might declare bankruptcy and lo and</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="5.759">behold they went under they have</text>
  <text start="419.46" dur="5.359">declared bankruptcy now they have</text>
  <text start="422.009" dur="8.611">liabilities of at least 1 billion and</text>
  <text start="424.819" dur="7.6">over 50,000 creditors and they just</text>
  <text start="430.62" dur="3.84">filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in</text>
  <text start="432.419" dur="5.25">Delaware and they&amp;#39;re gonna be closing a</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="4.949">lot of stores they have about 3,300</text>
  <text start="437.669" dur="5.55">stores and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of them</text>
  <text start="439.409" dur="6.57">closed down and I think this holiday</text>
  <text start="443.219" dur="5.581">season they&amp;#39;re gonna be closing about</text>
  <text start="445.979" dur="5.97">700 stores and this is during the</text>
  <text start="448.8" dur="5.64">busiest time of the year and we could</text>
  <text start="451.949" dur="5.551">see that many other stores are heading</text>
  <text start="454.44" dur="5.13">the same exact path and after this</text>
  <text start="457.5" dur="4.92">holiday season I think we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="459.57" dur="4.8">lot of stores start to close up shop</text>
  <text start="462.42" dur="3.84">I know Walmart Target they&amp;#39;ve been out</text>
  <text start="464.37" dur="2.76">there saying that oh it&amp;#39;s the tariffs</text>
  <text start="466.26" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re gonna have a really</text>
  <text start="467.13" dur="4.47">bad holiday season I don&amp;#39;t think it has</text>
  <text start="469.89" dur="2.79">anything to do with the tariffs I think</text>
  <text start="471.6" dur="2.25">they already knew that this holiday</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="3.09">season was going to be bad because if</text>
  <text start="473.85" dur="4.5">you look back at the last couple of</text>
  <text start="475.77" dur="5.61">holiday seasons they&amp;#39;ve been absolutely</text>
  <text start="478.35" dur="4.92">awful and they continually try to cover</text>
  <text start="481.38" dur="3.33">it up with weather on line and</text>
  <text start="483.27" dur="4.17">everything else and now they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="484.71" dur="4.92">tariffs so we&amp;#39;re gonna see the economy</text>
  <text start="487.44" dur="4.41">continually decline it&amp;#39;s not getting</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="3.51">better yes the manipulated numbers like</text>
  <text start="491.85" dur="3.03">unemployment where it came down to three</text>
  <text start="493.14" dur="4.77">point seven percent this is the lowest</text>
  <text start="494.88" dur="4.98">unemployment since 1969 remember this</text>
  <text start="497.91" dur="3.63">information is manipulated its</text>
  <text start="499.86" dur="3.6">manipulated on purpose this is part of</text>
  <text start="501.54" dur="3.78">the plan it&amp;#39;s to make the economy look</text>
  <text start="503.46" dur="4.8">incredibly strong actually the New York</text>
  <text start="505.32" dur="6.51">Fed is taking the opposite stance of</text>
  <text start="508.26" dur="5.49">what Trump and his administration are</text>
  <text start="511.83" dur="4.1">taking the New York Fed is saying listen</text>
  <text start="513.75" dur="5.34">now GDP is not going to be that great</text>
  <text start="515.93" dur="5.56">we&amp;#39;re starting to see the economy slow</text>
  <text start="519.09" dur="4.829">we don&amp;#39;t see anything in the threes or</text>
  <text start="521.49" dur="4.44">fours or fives we&amp;#39;re seeing it around</text>
  <text start="523.919" dur="4.921">two percent two point two seven percent</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="6.09">around that area now I remember going</text>
  <text start="528.84" dur="6.48">back to the Obama administration where</text>
  <text start="532.02" dur="4.95">the Fed was always telling us that GDP</text>
  <text start="535.32" dur="4.35">was going to be three three and a half</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="4.35">percent and they had to work the</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="4.77">opposite way because it never reached</text>
  <text start="541.32" dur="5.46">that high Trump he manipulated the GDP</text>
  <text start="544.44" dur="4.26">numbers by a trillion dollars so he has</text>
  <text start="546.78" dur="4.32">the ability to make GDP look any way he</text>
  <text start="548.7" dur="4.98">wants and we could see that the Fed</text>
  <text start="551.1" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re trying to counter this and of</text>
  <text start="553.68" dur="3.36">course why are they trying to counter</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="3.72">this they&amp;#39;re countering it because they</text>
  <text start="557.04" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t want everyone believing the</text>
  <text start="558.69" dur="6.36">economy is doing well because it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="561.81" dur="5.97">fit into their narrative and a strong</text>
  <text start="565.05" dur="5.58">incredible economy with 3.7 percent</text>
  <text start="567.78" dur="5.22">unemployment the stock market&amp;#39;s soaring</text>
  <text start="570.63" dur="5.67">everything looking great all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="573" dur="6.33">collapses how is this possible under the</text>
  <text start="576.3" dur="4.65">Fed it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="579.33" dur="3.78">trying to counter this any way they</text>
  <text start="580.95" dur="3.92">possibly can remember inside the Fed or</text>
  <text start="583.11" dur="4.56">any of these countries or organizations</text>
  <text start="584.87" dur="5.92">there&amp;#39;s always good guys and bad guys</text>
  <text start="587.67" dur="5.97">and I do believe that Powell who&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="590.79" dur="5.07">head of the Fed he is working with Trump</text>
  <text start="593.64" dur="5.22">and their other you know fed officials</text>
  <text start="595.86" dur="6.95">out there that are against what Powell</text>
  <text start="598.86" dur="7.08">is doing they don&amp;#39;t want to bring down</text>
  <text start="602.81" dur="4.69">the economy they want it to come down</text>
  <text start="605.94" dur="3.66">but they want it to make it look like</text>
  <text start="607.5" dur="3.6">Trump brought it down they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="609.6" dur="3.3">make it look like the Fed brought it</text>
  <text start="611.1" dur="5.01">down so they&amp;#39;re trying to counter this</text>
  <text start="612.9" dur="5.43">any way they possibly can now going back</text>
  <text start="616.11" dur="4.14">to what Trump said about Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="618.33" dur="5.85">saying maybe they should protect</text>
  <text start="620.25" dur="6.33">themselves this is an indicator letting</text>
  <text start="624.18" dur="4.83">everyone know that he&amp;#39;s getting ready to</text>
  <text start="626.58" dur="4.44">do away with the petrodollar I mean we</text>
  <text start="629.01" dur="4.14">already know that there is way too much</text>
  <text start="631.02" dur="4.56">debt the IMF has been warning about this</text>
  <text start="633.15" dur="4.62">now we know that the biz has been</text>
  <text start="635.58" dur="3.96">warning about this now Trump and the</text>
  <text start="637.77" dur="3.57">Patriots they already know there is way</text>
  <text start="639.54" dur="4.02">too much debt when Trump came into</text>
  <text start="641.34" dur="3.6">office he was saying the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="643.56" dur="4.44">a bubble the housing markets a bubble</text>
  <text start="644.94" dur="5.07">the debt is way too high and when he</text>
  <text start="648" dur="3.72">came into office everything switched</text>
  <text start="650.01" dur="3.78">around and everyone said oh look he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="5.34">liar this is ridiculous no this is part</text>
  <text start="653.79" dur="6.09">of the plan he&amp;#39;s using the ammunition of</text>
  <text start="657.06" dur="5.82">the central bank and the deep State</text>
  <text start="659.88" dur="5.85">against them because this was their</text>
  <text start="662.88" dur="4.95">manipulation policy so he&amp;#39;s using it</text>
  <text start="665.73" dur="5.34">against them this way they can&amp;#39;t call</text>
  <text start="667.83" dur="5.4">him out on destroying the economy this</text>
  <text start="671.07" dur="5.7">is why we see that the you know the the</text>
