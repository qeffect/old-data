  <text start="104.2" dur="4.59">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="106.24" dur="6.48">financial news now we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="108.79" dur="5.37">retail fall apart in other parts of the</text>
  <text start="112.72" dur="5.19">world not just here in the United States</text>
  <text start="114.16" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;re seeing it out in the UK and we can</text>
  <text start="117.91" dur="4.53">see that consumers out there well</text>
  <text start="120.07" dur="5.219">they&amp;#39;re spending less at the shops and</text>
  <text start="122.44" dur="6.209">last month well it looks like because of</text>
  <text start="125.289" dur="6.151">rising inflation weak wage growth the</text>
  <text start="128.649" dur="6.151">British Retail Consortium is showing</text>
  <text start="131.44" dur="5.97">that well May sales they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="134.8" dur="4.86">too well and it looks like sales have</text>
  <text start="137.41" dur="6.42">dropped by 4.4 percent this is the</text>
  <text start="139.66" dur="7.65">sharpest fall in four and a half years</text>
  <text start="143.83" dur="6.66">the survey also found that out online</text>
  <text start="147.31" dur="6.93">sales of non-food products grew at the</text>
  <text start="150.49" dur="6.36">slowest pace since December of 2012</text>
  <text start="154.24" dur="5.25">now shoppers spent about 4.3 percent</text>
  <text start="156.85" dur="4.68">more online in May than in the same</text>
  <text start="159.49" dur="4.829">month last year because that&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="161.53" dur="5.07">online is gaining ground but believe me</text>
  <text start="164.319" dur="5.521">we discussed this in many many reports</text>
  <text start="166.6" dur="6.84">online sales are a small fraction of</text>
  <text start="169.84" dur="6">retail sales today so when we look at</text>
  <text start="173.44" dur="5.36">brick-and-mortar shops and online sales</text>
  <text start="175.84" dur="8.069">we put them together consumers spent</text>
  <text start="178.8" dur="7.96">0.4% less in May which shows you that</text>
  <text start="183.909" dur="3.741">well they didn&amp;#39;t take their funds and go</text>
  <text start="186.76" dur="4.41">to online</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="6.819">because those combined that number is</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="4.649">less so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the same</text>
  <text start="194.469" dur="3.69">thing we&amp;#39;re seeing here in the United</text>
  <text start="195.819" dur="4.89">States and the rest of the world the</text>
  <text start="198.159" dur="4.17">everyday person is completely tapped out</text>
  <text start="200.709" dur="5.491">and it&amp;#39;s becoming more and more</text>
  <text start="202.329" dur="6.47">difficult to move forward because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.2" dur="7.53">losing jobs you&amp;#39;re making less money</text>
  <text start="208.799" dur="7.961">there&amp;#39;s inflation and right now the</text>
  <text start="213.73" dur="6.3">government the central bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="6.27">not there to help the people and as we</text>
  <text start="220.03" dur="4.65">go forward throughout this year we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.03" dur="3.989">going to see things actually get worse</text>
  <text start="224.68" dur="5.07">actually what we&amp;#39;re seeing with teenage</text>
  <text start="227.019" dur="4.56">workers right now who are coming out of</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="3.659">school looking for the part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="231.579" dur="5.371">they&amp;#39;re having actually a very difficult</text>
  <text start="233.409" dur="4.86">time finding these jobs and well one of</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="3.239">the reasons is because there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="238.269" dur="3.481">retail stores that are closing a lot of</text>
  <text start="240.189" dur="2.821">them are going bankrupt and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.75" dur="4.47">becoming more and more difficult to find</text>
  <text start="243.01" dur="7.199">these jobs the other problem is that the</text>
  <text start="246.22" dur="8.04">older generation well they are taking</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="6.361">the jobs now the question is why is the</text>
  <text start="254.26" dur="4.74">older generation going back to work well</text>
  <text start="256.57" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re getting 0% interest rates on</text>
  <text start="259" dur="5.58">their retirement funds and as their</text>
  <text start="262.51" dur="6.24">pensions are coming in they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="264.58" dur="7.17">inflation in food in housing and pretty</text>
  <text start="268.75" dur="4.68">much everything else and we can see that</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="3.539">it&amp;#39;s getting very difficult for these</text>
  <text start="273.43" dur="4.26">individuals live there on a fixed income</text>
  <text start="275.289" dur="5.641">and a lot of them don&amp;#39;t want to risk</text>
  <text start="277.69" dur="5.729">their money in the market even though</text>
  <text start="280.93" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s going up they&amp;#39;re saying you know</text>
  <text start="283.419" dur="2.881">something I&amp;#39;m going to stay out of it</text>
  <text start="284.71" dur="3.87">right now because I need my fixed income</text>
  <text start="286.3" dur="4.98">I can&amp;#39;t lose it all in the market and</text>
  <text start="288.58" dur="5.459">it&amp;#39;s getting more and more difficult for</text>
  <text start="291.28" dur="5.19">them to make ends meet and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.039" dur="5.071">happening is it&amp;#39;s pushing out the teens</text>
  <text start="296.47" dur="5.25">out of the market now with the extra</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="5.25">added benefit of retail stores closing</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="5.189">it&amp;#39;s becoming even harder for these</text>
  <text start="304.36" dur="5.76">individuals to get work and remember</text>
  <text start="306.909" dur="6.38">those people who have finished college</text>
  <text start="310.12" dur="6.06">who are getting laid off from their jobs</text>
  <text start="313.289" dur="6.19">they&amp;#39;re also going for the part-time</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="5.15">jobs bartenders waiters waitresses any</text>
  <text start="319.479" dur="3.921">retail job they can find</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="4.38">mind because they can&amp;#39;t find the</text>
  <text start="323.4" dur="4.47">full-time job so the next generation</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="5.94">coming up is even having a more</text>
  <text start="327.87" dur="7.139">difficult period of time now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="331.65" dur="6.21">interesting is that the last two times</text>
  <text start="335.009" dur="6.38">that stocks did what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="8.059">now it happened in the years 2000 and</text>
  <text start="341.389" dur="7.24">2007 now the number of S&amp;amp;P 500 companies</text>
  <text start="345.919" dur="6.191">reporting negative earnings is rising</text>
  <text start="348.629" dur="6.771">rapidly now why is this a big deal why</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="6">does this matter well it matters because</text>
  <text start="355.4" dur="6.31">usually when we see this type of signal</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="6.75">it&amp;#39;s right before a stock market peak</text>
  <text start="361.71" dur="4.859">now as you can see we are now at levels</text>
  <text start="364.86" dur="3.989">that have usually occurred just before</text>
  <text start="366.569" dur="6.301">stock market Peaks now last time two</text>
  <text start="368.849" dur="8.011">times we saw this was in 2000 and 2007</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="6.03">and both of these times investors</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="4.369">believe that stocks could never go down</text>
  <text start="378.9" dur="4.44">and we&amp;#39;ve heard this before we heard</text>
  <text start="381.229" dur="3.851">individuals say well real estate could</text>
  <text start="383.34" dur="3.629">never go down the stock market will</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="6.059">never go down because the economy is</text>
  <text start="386.969" dur="7.021">roaring and we reached a kind of</text>
  <text start="391.139" dur="4.471">financial utopia where people believe</text>
  <text start="393.99" dur="5.97">that this is going to go on forever</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="6.359">well nothing goes on forever and we can</text>
  <text start="399.96" dur="6.239">see that this illusion that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="401.969" dur="6.931">in well it is coming to an end and what</text>
  <text start="406.199" dur="5.671">happened in 2000 and 2007 both of these</text>
  <text start="408.9" dur="5.939">times the whole entire thing came</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="5.789">crashing down but this time it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="414.839" dur="5.971">little different because the market is</text>
  <text start="417.659" dur="5.13">at a much higher point we have bubbles</text>
  <text start="420.81" dur="2.579">that are larger than we&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text>
  <text start="422.789" dur="3.75">before</text>
  <text start="423.389" dur="6.631">we&amp;#39;re in debt like we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="426.539" dur="7.291">before and when this hits it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="430.02" dur="6.84">come crashing down big time now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="433.83" dur="6.03">been talking about Spain&amp;#39;s Banco Popular</text>
  <text start="436.86" dur="5.16">and we were talking about how they might</text>
  <text start="439.86" dur="4.589">do a bailout which we really think that</text>
  <text start="442.02" dur="4.47">was going to happen we thought that they</text>
  <text start="444.449" dur="4.77">might do a bail in or they might look</text>
  <text start="446.49" dur="6.12">for some type of investor to purchase a</text>
  <text start="449.219" dur="5.491">lot of the financial assets well it</text>
  <text start="452.61" dur="6.61">looks like after the</text>
  <text start="454.71" dur="7.57">banco popular chairman told his</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="4.62">employees don&amp;#39;t panic and the central</text>
  <text start="462.28" dur="2.34">bank was out there saying don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="463.84" dur="4.62">about this</text>
  <text start="464.62" dur="6.87">the ECB confirm that the six largest</text>
  <text start="468.46" dur="5.73">Spanish bank was indeed on the verge of</text>
  <text start="471.49" dur="6.36">collapse and it ordered it to be sold</text>
  <text start="474.19" dur="9.99">which is what happened when Santander</text>
  <text start="477.85" dur="9.36">acquired the Bank for one euro now they</text>
  <text start="484.18" dur="7.26">did this after there was a ballon and</text>
  <text start="487.21" dur="6.81">the ballon basically took the dead</text>
  <text start="491.44" dur="6.09">instruments the whiskey equities and</text>
  <text start="494.02" dur="8.7">they wiped him out in posing losses of</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="7.71">about 3.3 billion euros and this was</text>
  <text start="502.72" dur="7.26">done on the banks security holders so we</text>
  <text start="505.24" dur="7.26">just had a ballon now of course what are</text>
  <text start="509.98" dur="4.8">we seeing we&amp;#39;re not really hearing</text>
  <text start="512.5" dur="5.76">anything about this no one&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="514.78" dur="6.689">talking about this and this is the first</text>
  <text start="518.26" dur="7.05">major bank capital bonds to be bailed in</text>
  <text start="521.469" dur="7.491">wiped out under the new EU regulations</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="6.66">so they&amp;#39;ve already done it here we are</text>
  <text start="528.96" dur="5.2">which means the next bank that this</text>
  <text start="531.97" dur="4.83">happens to the next bank this happens to</text>
  <text start="534.16" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re going to use the balance again</text>
  <text start="536.8" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;ve said this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="539.44" dur="5.85">they didn&amp;#39;t create these bail in</text>
  <text start="542.2" dur="5.94">documents to have these reports and</text>
  <text start="545.29" dur="4.56">these papers just to look really nice in</text>
  <text start="548.14" dur="3.81">their filing cabinets or on their</text>
  <text start="549.85" dur="4.26">computer systems they did it for a</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="4.02">reason they did it because they knew</text>
  <text start="554.11" dur="3.78">they were going to use them later on</text>
  <text start="555.97" dur="3.6">even though they tell us the stress</text>
  <text start="557.89" dur="3.48">tests are showing that the banks are</text>
  <text start="559.57" dur="3.93">strong some are a little weak but don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="561.37" dur="4.8">worry about it these stress tests are</text>
  <text start="563.5" dur="4.8">fake they were put into place to</text>
  <text start="566.17" dur="5.7">convince you that these banks were</text>
  <text start="568.3" dur="6.33">strong after 2008 even though they will</text>
  <text start="571.87" dur="5.76">not be able to survive any type of crash</text>
  <text start="574.63" dur="5.36">and we&amp;#39;re seeing home Capital Group well</text>
  <text start="577.63" dur="5.28">that has going down we see Banco Popular</text>
  <text start="579.99" dur="4.96">that has just been bailed in the next</text>
  <text start="582.91" dur="5.22">Bank it could be an Italian bank it</text>
  <text start="584.95" dur="6.48">could be deutsche bank when they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="588.13" dur="5.67">get anyone to buy up anything they will</text>
  <text start="591.43" dur="5.43">bail in these banks and those</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="5.85">individuals that have deposits who have</text>
  <text start="596.86" dur="5.4">their equity in the bank guess what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.65" dur="6.45">going to be completely wiped out and</text>
  <text start="602.26" dur="7.83">this is the beginning of all of it it is</text>
  <text start="606.1" dur="6.18">already started this is a warning the</text>
  <text start="610.09" dur="6">universe just whispered to you and said</text>
  <text start="612.28" dur="6.36">listen they are doing this now it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="616.09" dur="5.13">matter of time before all the banks</text>
  <text start="618.64" dur="5.34">start to fail it&amp;#39;s a matter of time</text>
  <text start="621.22" dur="5.55">before they start bailing in each and</text>
  <text start="623.98" dur="5.4">every one of these banks because they</text>
  <text start="626.77" dur="4.86">have no alternative that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="629.38" dur="5.43">created the bail in documents remember</text>
  <text start="631.63" dur="5.07">the central bank the deep state they</text>
  <text start="634.81" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t want to give up what they have and</text>
  <text start="636.7" dur="5.28">if they can&amp;#39;t get a bailout well they</text>
  <text start="639.58" dur="6.33">want to keep what they have so they will</text>
  <text start="641.98" dur="6.78">go inside and take what they need they</text>
  <text start="645.91" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t care they don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="648.76" dur="5.67">country they don&amp;#39;t care about the people</text>
  <text start="650.68" dur="6.54">they care about themselves now something</text>
  <text start="654.43" dur="3.93">very interesting be Chinese they made an</text>
  <text start="657.22" dur="4.5">announcement that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="658.36" dur="6.06">buying more US Treasuries now this is</text>
  <text start="661.72" dur="5.31">kind of odd because first of all why</text>
  <text start="664.42" dur="4.08">would they announce this if China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.03" dur="3.3">attention was to buy US Treasuries</text>
  <text start="668.5" dur="4.5">because they are cheap versus other</text>
  <text start="670.33" dur="4.98">countries why on earth would they</text>
  <text start="673" dur="5.16">announce their plans ahead of time it</text>
  <text start="675.31" dur="4.89">makes no sense well maybe there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="678.16" dur="4.92">one answer to this maybe the Chinese</text>
  <text start="680.2" dur="5.49">have an ulterior motive the question is</text>
  <text start="683.08" dur="4.95">what is it what are they trying to do</text>
  <text start="685.69" dur="4.74">here and this might have to do more with</text>
  <text start="688.03" dur="4.32">the currency market than the bond market</text>
  <text start="690.43" dur="3.75">because there&amp;#39;s no doubt that the</text>
  <text start="692.35" dur="3.78">Chinese citizens believe the you want is</text>
  <text start="694.18" dur="4.08">way too high the Chinese authorities</text>
  <text start="696.13" dur="3.96">realize the problem and they have</text>
  <text start="698.26" dur="5.46">tightened capital controls and attempt</text>
  <text start="700.09" dur="5.88">to basically bring down the currency but</text>
  <text start="703.72" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s not a long-term solution and the</text>
  <text start="705.97" dur="5.67">Chinese realize you want needs to be</text>
  <text start="708.31" dur="7.92">devalued lower so if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="711.64" dur="8.76">when Trump met Zhi Jing ping when they</text>
  <text start="716.23" dur="5.37">talked about their plan in Mara Largo</text>
  <text start="720.4" dur="2.429">instead of the</text>
  <text start="721.6" dur="3.299">white house because the white house is</text>
  <text start="722.829" dur="3.661">bugged and they were afraid of leaks it</text>
  <text start="724.899" dur="6.571">looks like they might have come up with</text>
  <text start="726.49" dur="7.68">a deal where China would invest in US</text>
  <text start="731.47" dur="6.599">infrastructure they would help with</text>
  <text start="734.17" dur="7.169">North Korea maybe the US would join the</text>
  <text start="738.069" dur="5.671">belt and Road in return the US would</text>
  <text start="741.339" dur="5.37">allow China to vie to devalue their</text>
  <text start="743.74" dur="6">currency and this is why we all of a</text>
  <text start="746.709" dur="6.18">sudden heard Trump say well China&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="749.74" dur="6.87">a currency manipulator because it looks</text>
  <text start="752.889" dur="7.14">like he made deals with China with</text>
  <text start="756.61" dur="7.08">Russia and many other countries and this</text>
  <text start="760.029" dur="5.73">might be part of the deal now we can see</text>
  <text start="763.69" dur="4.319">that a lot of things are happening</text>
  <text start="765.759" dur="4.711">around the world especially with Russia</text>
  <text start="768.009" dur="5.611">especially with especially with China</text>
  <text start="770.47" dur="5.64">and we know that China has been using</text>
  <text start="773.62" dur="4.62">the finance system to build up their</text>
  <text start="776.11" dur="4.5">infrastructure to build these cities to</text>
  <text start="778.24" dur="5.039">build these railways to do all of these</text>
  <text start="780.61" dur="4.86">different things and Trump and Zhi Jing</text>
  <text start="783.279" dur="3.961">ping it looks like they came to an</text>
  <text start="785.47" dur="2.429">agreement listen we know the economies</text>
  <text start="787.24" dur="2.64">are coming down</text>
  <text start="787.899" dur="3.211">we know there&amp;#39;s bubbles all over the</text>
  <text start="789.88" dur="3.809">place we know there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="791.11" dur="5.37">credit freeze and it really makes no</text>
  <text start="793.689" dur="5.311">difference we need to set up this system</text>
  <text start="796.48" dur="3.919">to go forward after the collapse after</text>
  <text start="799" dur="4.439">we go through this great transition</text>
  <text start="800.399" dur="6.221">period and I think this is why Trump had</text>
  <text start="803.439" dur="5.82">an about-face because he realized with</text>
  <text start="806.62" dur="5.339">the other leaders Russia Putin Xi</text>
  <text start="809.259" dur="4.411">Jinping and the others that yes we need</text>
