  <text start="26.97" dur="6.81">hi and welcome to the x 22 report my</text>
  <text start="29.859" dur="6.151">name is dave and this is episode 107 and</text>
  <text start="33.78" dur="4.599">the title of this episode is the</text>
  <text start="36.01" dur="4.2">government is working in stealth mode to</text>
  <text start="38.379" dur="3.241">prepare for the economic collapse and i</text>
  <text start="40.21" dur="3.39">just want to say one comment before i</text>
  <text start="41.62" dur="5.669">get started this has to go this goes</text>
  <text start="43.6" dur="6.75">back to the magazines and the wait yes</text>
  <text start="47.289" dur="4.921">if you disperse the bullets over many</text>
  <text start="50.35" dur="3.33">different magazines it&amp;#39;s the same weight</text>
  <text start="52.21" dur="3.899">except for the magazines they have a</text>
  <text start="53.68" dur="7.019">couple more ounces but my point of the</text>
  <text start="56.109" dur="8.401">whole topic was when you&amp;#39;re in battle</text>
  <text start="60.699" dur="7.74">and your opponent has 30 round magazines</text>
  <text start="64.51" dur="6.81">or more and you only can find 10-round</text>
  <text start="68.439" dur="6.121">magazines and you have to carry these</text>
  <text start="71.32" dur="5.369">magazines all over the place and your</text>
  <text start="74.56" dur="5.07">opponent can continually shoot and you</text>
  <text start="76.689" dur="5.341">have to reload it is a very different</text>
  <text start="79.63" dur="4.77">scenario yes there are those people who</text>
  <text start="82.03" dur="5.31">are professionals that can switch out</text>
  <text start="84.4" dur="6.42">their magazines very quickly but again</text>
  <text start="87.34" dur="5.37">in a battle situation it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="90.82" dur="5.369">different and you have to remember just</text>
  <text start="92.71" dur="7.14">like in the Revolutionary War everyone</text>
  <text start="96.189" dur="7.411">is not a professional there are going to</text>
  <text start="99.85" dur="6.589">be those people who used the weapon once</text>
  <text start="103.6" dur="6.39">or twice that will be fighting alongside</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="5.801">that will have a problem and it will be</text>
  <text start="109.99" dur="5.1">much more difficult for those people and</text>
  <text start="112.24" dur="5.309">this is what the government is trying to</text>
  <text start="115.09" dur="5.52">do because now that person has ten</text>
  <text start="117.549" dur="6">rounds they just finished our ten rounds</text>
  <text start="120.61" dur="5.85">and the opponents have many more rounds</text>
  <text start="123.549" dur="6.99">if we&amp;#39;re looking at this you know one</text>
  <text start="126.46" dur="7.05">person to a fighting one-on-one and this</text>
  <text start="130.539" dur="6.59">will make it much more difficult for</text>
  <text start="133.51" dur="8.19">even professionals in a battle</text>
  <text start="137.129" dur="6.821">situation and and I know people think</text>
  <text start="141.7" dur="4.17">that this is only for the mass shootings</text>
  <text start="143.95" dur="5.369">and this is why they want to do it but</text>
  <text start="145.87" dur="7.56">their agenda is really for if something</text>
  <text start="149.319" dur="8.04">goes down how can we make it easier for</text>
  <text start="153.43" dur="6.36">the DHS any other type of private</text>
  <text start="157.359" dur="4.11">military can&amp;#39;t you know the Canadians</text>
  <text start="159.79" dur="4.8">that we have an agreement with we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="161.469" dur="5.731">Russian soldiers it will make it much</text>
  <text start="164.59" dur="6.149">more difficult for those people who are</text>
  <text start="167.2" dur="7.319">fighting back having ten rounds compared</text>
  <text start="170.739" dur="6.93">to 30 plus they have to carry many more</text>
  <text start="174.519" dur="6.451">magazines compared to those who can</text>
  <text start="177.669" dur="6.54">carry four magazines on them and have</text>
  <text start="180.97" dur="6.21">you know 120 rounds right there that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.209" dur="8.101">120 rounds to compare to those people</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="8.58">that have to carry 12 magazines to get</text>
  <text start="192.31" dur="5.879">the same 120 rounds and switch off when</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="4.939">you&amp;#39;re in battle is very different than</text>
  <text start="198.189" dur="6.031">what you&amp;#39;re at the range or just</text>
  <text start="200.699" dur="5.111">practicing in a different situation when</text>
  <text start="204.22" dur="5.669">you have fire coming back at you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="205.81" dur="7.649">very different but let&amp;#39;s move on and go</text>
  <text start="209.889" dur="6.63">through the economic collapse news and</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="4.62">see what&amp;#39;s going on it now there was an</text>
  <text start="216.519" dur="5.36">article that says the wheels are coming</text>
  <text start="218.079" dur="6.72">off the whole of southern Europe</text>

  <text start="313.9" dur="5.16">is continually rising it is not going</text>
  <text start="316.63" dur="4.98">down it is continually going up and the</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="4.32">matter is the whole entire economy is</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="3.869">just getting worse and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="323.38" dur="5.009">before in the Great Depression where</text>
  <text start="325.479" dur="5.761">Europe first entered the recession /</text>
  <text start="328.389" dur="5.28">depression and when you looked over at</text>
  <text start="331.24" dur="4.32">America the stock market what was that</text>
  <text start="333.669" dur="4.021">its all-time highs and that&amp;#39;s all anyone</text>
  <text start="335.56" dur="3.72">ever really looked at but again in</text>
  <text start="337.69" dur="6.81">America there was a disconnect between</text>
  <text start="339.28" dur="8.58">the economy and the stock market during</text>
  <text start="344.5" dur="5.76">this time paper time period Food lines</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="4.05">were starting to form people were</text>
  <text start="350.26" dur="3.69">getting out of work businesses were</text>
  <text start="351.91" dur="3.979">laying off and getting rid of people</text>
  <text start="353.95" dur="4.98">other businesses for closing down and</text>
  <text start="355.889" dur="6.821">really what are we seeing here today I</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="6.81">mean stock market hitting its all time</text>
  <text start="362.71" dur="5.67">high the SP hitting its all time high</text>
  <text start="365.74" dur="6.42">going higher and higher and higher why</text>
  <text start="368.38" dur="7.2">because we know the Fed is not going to</text>
  <text start="372.16" dur="5.64">taper they always give the same excuse</text>
  <text start="375.58" dur="6.99">because of economic factors we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="377.8" dur="6.149">tapering I know people are and and other</text>
  <text start="382.57" dur="3.569">reports are saying that they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="383.949" dur="4.141">going to taper in September I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="386.139" dur="3.871">believe they are going to taper at all</text>
  <text start="388.09" dur="4.02">because they can&amp;#39;t the whole thing will</text>
  <text start="390.01" dur="4.409">be lit they&amp;#39;re screwed either way it</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="4.23">doesn&amp;#39;t really make a difference if they</text>
  <text start="394.419" dur="5.341">taper in September and they start</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="7.71">cutting back we have a collapsed during</text>
  <text start="399.76" dur="6.059">that period now they might do it</text>
  <text start="404.05" dur="2.91">they might you know give it a whirl to</text>
  <text start="405.819" dur="3.53">see what happens in the stock market</text>
  <text start="406.96" dur="5.22">might go from 15 or whatever we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="409.349" dur="4.181">17,000 points all the way down and I and</text>
  <text start="412.18" dur="3.389">they say oh no we have to continue</text>
  <text start="413.53" dur="3.66">tapering because of these economic</text>
  <text start="415.569" dur="3.09">conditions blah blah blah blah and they</text>
  <text start="417.19" dur="7.08">might build the market back up again</text>
  <text start="418.659" dur="13.051">that could happen if the Fed continually</text>
  <text start="424.27" dur="12.209">prints the fall down the collapse of the</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="7.679">market is going to be even worse than it</text>
  <text start="436.479" dur="5.671">would be right now and right now it is</text>
  <text start="439.389" dur="4.921">really really bad so they can continue</text>
  <text start="442.15" dur="4.43">on this pace but everything always comes</text>
  <text start="444.31" dur="4.71">to an end and they will eventually</text>
  <text start="446.58" dur="4.57">collapse the system so basically I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="449.02" dur="5.299">done this in another episode the Fed is</text>
  <text start="451.15" dur="6.63">screwed no matter which way they go</text>
  <text start="454.319" dur="7.181">there is a collapse in the future it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="457.78" dur="7.56">all that is different is when it happens</text>
  <text start="461.5" dur="7.139">and we can see from the economic</text>
  <text start="465.34" dur="5.49">indicators the housing is not recovering</text>
  <text start="468.639" dur="7.381">like I said before the mortgage</text>
  <text start="470.83" dur="10.61">application drought continues the as the</text>
  <text start="476.02" dur="14.449">mortgage rates rise there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="481.44" dur="13.3">dramatically reduced amount of people</text>
  <text start="490.469" dur="7.271">purchasing or applying for mortgages</text>
  <text start="494.74" dur="5.489">right now for loans the mortgage</text>
  <text start="497.74" dur="5.359">applications fell for the eighth week of</text>
  <text start="500.229" dur="6.8">the last nine at the fastest</text>
  <text start="503.099" dur="8.641">year-over-year pace in three years and</text>
  <text start="507.029" dur="7.601">slumped to a two-year low it&amp;#39;s the worst</text>
  <text start="511.74" dur="9.19">year-over-year change in three years and</text>
  <text start="514.63" dur="9.18">basically when the mortgage rates rise</text>
  <text start="520.93" dur="5.219">it continually kicks out those people</text>
  <text start="523.81" dur="5.719">who can afford a house and those people</text>
  <text start="526.149" dur="6.361">who are purchasing homes are barely</text>
  <text start="529.529" dur="6.881">purchasing these homes with no money</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="5.31">down and all the hedge fund and other</text>
  <text start="536.41" dur="4.29">investors are</text>
  <text start="537.82" dur="6.9">now bailing on the homes that they</text>
  <text start="540.7" dur="9.36">purchased to rent because things are not</text>
  <text start="544.72" dur="8.76">looking well in the housing market now</text>
  <text start="550.06" dur="5.97">what did the Fed really say about the</text>
  <text start="553.48" dur="5.13">economy they still seek they still say</text>
  <text start="556.03" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s week that they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="558.61" dur="5.66">to you know they have to look forward to</text>
  <text start="562.18" dur="5.28">see how the economy does and how the</text>
  <text start="564.27" dur="4.99">unemployment rate goes and this is all</text>
  <text start="567.46" dur="6.12">doublespeak i like to call it management</text>
  <text start="569.26" dur="7.26">babble and basically this is Bernanke</text>
  <text start="573.58" dur="4.95">babble and he continually says this and</text>
  <text start="576.52" dur="5.97">how can you believe a man anyhow that</text>
  <text start="578.53" dur="6.03">back in two thousand eight when he</text>
  <text start="582.49" dur="3.93">stated that you know the Fed does not</text>
  <text start="584.56" dur="6.08">forecast a recession in the near future</text>
  <text start="586.42" dur="8.19">and basically the recession happened</text>
  <text start="590.64" dur="6.49">later that year so whatever he says it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="594.61" dur="5.07">not the benefit it&amp;#39;s not benefiting to</text>
  <text start="597.13" dur="6.03">it he&amp;#39;s not trying to benefit the people</text>
  <text start="599.68" dur="8.22">he&amp;#39;s looking at this and saying holy</text>
  <text start="603.16" dur="6.51">crap I&amp;#39;m screwed you know we now what am</text>
  <text start="607.9" dur="3.78">I going to say we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="609.67" dur="4.17">continually printing but I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="611.68" dur="5.04">say that and he comes up with this whole</text>
  <text start="613.84" dur="5.19">double speak about the economy if it</text>
  <text start="616.72" dur="4.89">goes well if it doesn&amp;#39;t go well maybe I</text>
  <text start="619.03" dur="5.96">will maybe I won&amp;#39;t and it&amp;#39;s a bunch of</text>
  <text start="621.61" dur="6.06">BS and he knows what they have to do</text>
  <text start="624.99" dur="6.09">because they&amp;#39;re screwed either way it</text>
  <text start="627.67" dur="8.15">doesn&amp;#39;t really make a difference now</text>
  <text start="631.08" dur="7.51">Japan ready to declare will go first</text>
  <text start="635.82" dur="7.42">Japan has no intention to go it alone in</text>
  <text start="638.59" dur="6.6">defending if territory and the there are</text>
  <text start="643.24" dur="4.02">national interest from growing threats</text>
  <text start="645.19" dur="3.84">in the Asian Pacific region we know the</text>
  <text start="647.26" dur="4.2">China and Japan are fighting over this</text>
  <text start="649.03" dur="4.32">island but an annual defense review</text>
  <text start="651.46" dur="3.93">released Tuesday and other recent</text>
  <text start="653.35" dur="4.32">development signal in increasing</text>
  <text start="655.39" dur="4.61">willingness on the part of Japan to go</text>
  <text start="657.67" dur="4.71">it alone and what they mean by this is</text>
  <text start="660" dur="5.68">Japan is creating a new National</text>
  <text start="662.38" dur="6.33">Security Council and streamlining when</text>
  <text start="665.68" dur="5.82">Tokyo would use military force and not</text>
  <text start="668.71" dur="6.57">have the okay and the backup of the</text>
  <text start="671.5" dur="5.88">US government because the United States</text>
  <text start="675.28" dur="5.01">remains Japan&amp;#39;s essential security</text>
  <text start="677.38" dur="4.98">partner and they will go ahead and</text>
  <text start="680.29" dur="5.09">determine if they should use military</text>
  <text start="682.36" dur="6.57">force with China without the u.s.</text>
  <text start="685.38" dur="6.58">backing them up in the beginning so they</text>
  <text start="688.93" dur="5.13">are preparing for this war that we know</text>
  <text start="691.96" dur="6.8">eventually is going to come because we</text>
  <text start="694.06" dur="4.7">know that world war three is on its way</text>
  <text start="700.11" dur="7.03">because they need to cover up the</text>
  <text start="704.02" dur="5.16">economic collapse with a world war so</text>
  <text start="707.14" dur="4.14">the central bankers are not blamed and</text>
  <text start="709.18" dur="5.01">this way they can reset the entire</text>
  <text start="711.28" dur="4.71">system whoever&amp;#39;s left from the world war</text>
  <text start="714.19" dur="5.45">and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="715.99" dur="6.48">accomplish right now now Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="719.64" dur="5.77">targeting Iran and Israel of ballistic</text>
  <text start="722.47" dur="5.43">missiles personally let&amp;#39;s say Saudi</text>
  <text start="725.41" dur="3.99">Arabia is controlled by the US</text>
  <text start="727.9" dur="4.62">government baton that&amp;#39;s really what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="729.4" dur="5.25">happening here and the United States</text>
  <text start="732.52" dur="7.25">government is buddy-buddy with Israel</text>
  <text start="734.65" dur="8.01">and the only odd man out here is Iran</text>
  <text start="739.77" dur="6.13">the US government wants to get into Iran</text>
  <text start="742.66" dur="5.46">because they want to set up the US</text>
  <text start="745.9" dur="5.01">dollar as a reserve currency and set up</text>
  <text start="748.12" dur="6.3">a central bank Saudi Arabia already has</text>
  <text start="750.91" dur="5.04">and already is using the US dollar as a</text>

  <text start="1351.99" dur="4.37">makes it easier for them to know who&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1356.36" dur="6.06">for people to get you know fake IDs</text>
