  <text start="107.899" dur="3.81">can see the world has been moving away</text>
  <text start="109.61" dur="4.799">from the dollar we know that China</text>
  <text start="111.709" dur="4.891">Russia a lot of the BRIC nations they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="114.409" dur="5.551">been moving away they&amp;#39;ve been setting up</text>
  <text start="116.6" dur="5.159">their own payment systems they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="119.96" dur="4.409">buying a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="121.759" dur="5.25">keeping it buying it at a very very low</text>
  <text start="124.369" dur="4.831">price and they set up their own</text>
  <text start="127.009" dur="5.401">exchanges and they&amp;#39;re dealing with other</text>
  <text start="129.2" dur="6.659">countries using their own currencies and</text>
  <text start="132.41" dur="5.79">this reminds me of when we were coming</text>
  <text start="135.859" dur="5.281">off the gold standard back in the 70s</text>
  <text start="138.2" dur="4.71">where countries decided wait a minute</text>
  <text start="141.14" dur="4.34">what is the central bank doing here</text>
  <text start="142.91" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re creating a lot of currency and</text>
  <text start="145.48" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re creating a lot more currency</text>
  <text start="147.92" dur="4.8">then there is gold that could back it up</text>
  <text start="150.79" dur="3.97">countries back then said you know</text>
  <text start="152.72" dur="4.2">something we see what you&amp;#39;re doing we</text>
  <text start="154.76" dur="4.5">want our gold back this is not I will</text>
  <text start="156.92" dur="4.47">this is not our agreement we didn&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="159.26" dur="4.71">didn&amp;#39;t want this to happen and we want</text>
  <text start="161.39" dur="4.05">our gold back and this is why Nixon went</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="4.079">out there and said hey listen there are</text>
  <text start="165.44" dur="6.329">speculators out there and we need to</text>
  <text start="168.049" dur="5.431">remove the United States from the gold</text>
  <text start="171.769" dur="4.261">standard and of course this is coming</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="5.009">from the central banks so they can print</text>
  <text start="176.03" dur="3.87">a lot more currency and take control of</text>
  <text start="178.489" dur="4.051">the countries by putting them to debt</text>
  <text start="179.9" dur="4.5">and it really closed the gold window</text>
  <text start="182.54" dur="2.67">where countries couldn&amp;#39;t get their gold</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="3.27">back</text>
  <text start="185.21" dur="5.54">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see the same exact</text>
  <text start="187.67" dur="6.15">thing happen once again this time</text>
  <text start="190.75" dur="6.82">they&amp;#39;re getting their gold back because</text>
  <text start="193.82" dur="6.51">what is the central bank going to say no</text>
  <text start="197.57" dur="5.16">you can&amp;#39;t have it why not what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="200.33" dur="4.41">excuse yes maybe they could have made</text>
  <text start="202.73" dur="3.78">something up but it looks like these</text>
  <text start="204.74" dur="3.39">countries are getting their gold back</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="5.07">then as well at Germany Austria</text>
  <text start="208.13" dur="6.09">Netherlands Turkey and many other</text>
  <text start="211.58" dur="6.6">countries are asking for their gold back</text>
  <text start="214.22" dur="6.78">now gold delivery is still ongoing but</text>
  <text start="218.18" dur="6.06">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that rwan is</text>
  <text start="221" dur="6.72">out there and he is really pushing to</text>
  <text start="224.24" dur="5.64">get all of turkey&amp;#39;s gold back and it</text>
  <text start="227.72" dur="5.52">looks like it is happening but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="229.88" dur="6.39">very strange is that the gold is not</text>
  <text start="233.24" dur="6.06">going to Turkey it&amp;#39;s going to the Bank</text>
  <text start="236.27" dur="5.52">of International Settlement instead now</text>
  <text start="239.3" dur="5.79">this is very odd why is this happening</text>
  <text start="241.79" dur="6.15">we don&amp;#39;t know as of yet even though rwan</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="6.95">is continually saying listen we need our</text>
  <text start="247.94" dur="7.67">goal back and there is no reason to use</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="7.18">the dollar there&amp;#39;s no reason for it and</text>
  <text start="255.61" dur="5.23">we can see from the records and these</text>
  <text start="259.22" dur="3.84">are the records from the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="260.84" dur="5.07">from the Fed data and most of it most</text>
  <text start="263.06" dur="4.8">likely is completely fake they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="265.91" dur="4.71">there&amp;#39;s about fifty seven hundred and</text>
  <text start="267.86" dur="5.07">fifty tons left with all the countries</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="4.5">asking for their gold back and at this</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="4.26">point we realize that most likely</text>
  <text start="275.12" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s really hardly anything left in</text>
  <text start="277.19" dur="5.7">the vaults because as we can see with</text>
  <text start="280.52" dur="4.23">minutia and all the others they only go</text>
  <text start="282.89" dur="4.62">to the same room they only hold up one</text>
  <text start="284.75" dur="6.42">gold bar there hasn&amp;#39;t been an audit in</text>
  <text start="287.51" dur="5.73">this entire vault for a very long time</text>
  <text start="291.17" dur="3.27">which means something&amp;#39;s going on because</text>
  <text start="293.24" dur="3.44">if they had nothing to hide</text>
  <text start="294.44" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;d be no problem whatsoever</text>
  <text start="296.68" dur="5.23">allowing auditors to come in to see how</text>
  <text start="299.75" dur="5.79">much gold there is looking at the serial</text>
  <text start="301.91" dur="6.78">numbers writing it down comparing it the</text>
  <text start="305.54" dur="5.73">only time you reject auditing is when</text>
  <text start="308.69" dur="4.2">you&amp;#39;re trying to hide something and we</text>
  <text start="311.27" dur="2.79">need to remember that the Fed is not</text>
  <text start="312.89" dur="3.57">part of the government whatsoever it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="314.06" dur="4.68">private corporation and once again we</text>
  <text start="316.46" dur="2.91">really don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="3.33">because</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re not allowing anyone to see what</text>
  <text start="322.07" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re doing and again if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.62" dur="6.39">working for the American people we</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="6.419">should see everything because this is</text>
  <text start="331.01" dur="4.29">our government We the People</text>
  <text start="333.199" dur="5.791">the Federal Reserve is not part of our</text>
  <text start="335.3" dur="6.42">government so why do they exist if we</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="4.38">can&amp;#39;t see what they&amp;#39;re doing because</text>
  <text start="341.72" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re supposed to be working for We</text>
  <text start="343.37" dur="2.88">the People but we know they&amp;#39;re not it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.11" dur="3.48">a private corporation they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="346.25" dur="3.63">working for themselves and of course</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="2.579">they have the whole mandate with the</text>
  <text start="349.88" dur="3.21">government and things like that but I</text>
  <text start="351.169" dur="4.981">mean it&amp;#39;s absolutely meaningless because</text>
  <text start="353.09" dur="5.94">the federal reserve only works for</text>
  <text start="356.15" dur="5.46">themselves to control nations now we can</text>
  <text start="359.03" dur="5.9">see that with China introducing the</text>
  <text start="361.61" dur="7.98">petrel you one that is gaining ground</text>
  <text start="364.93" dur="7.15">more countries are buying into using the</text>
  <text start="369.59" dur="4.949">petrol you want instead of the petro</text>
  <text start="372.08" dur="5.25">dollar or ramping up on the petrol you</text>
  <text start="374.539" dur="6.061">want while keeping the petro dollar at</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="6.059">the same start at the same time and we</text>
  <text start="380.6" dur="5.43">can see right now once central banks</text>
  <text start="383.389" dur="4.711">once countries continually do this and</text>
  <text start="386.03" dur="4.5">they add the petrol one and hold both</text>
  <text start="388.1" dur="5.16">the dollar and the you want at the same</text>
  <text start="390.53" dur="5.22">time that means they can make the switch</text>
  <text start="393.26" dur="4.26">very very quickly I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="395.75" dur="3.15">just a couple of weeks I mean maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.52" dur="3.23">a month and a half or two months right</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="5.04">now do you want back</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="6.099">crude oil contracts have soared to 12%</text>
  <text start="403.94" dur="5.01">of global trading already this is a very</text>
  <text start="406.849" dur="4.5">short period of time and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.95" dur="6.42">accelerating right now I mean all</text>
  <text start="411.349" dur="8.19">countries need to do is they need to</text>
  <text start="415.37" dur="8.15">start trading in the yuan purchasing</text>
  <text start="419.539" dur="7.281">your oil and as they keep doing this</text>
  <text start="423.52" dur="7.78">this will lead to a massive increase in</text>
  <text start="426.82" dur="7.48">global demand for the u1 and eventually</text>
  <text start="431.3" dur="5.88">what will happen it will become a truly</text>
  <text start="434.3" dur="5.489">international currency this doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="437.18" dur="3.63">to take a very long time I know the</text>
  <text start="439.789" dur="2.521">corporate media and others saying</text>
  <text start="440.81" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s going to take forever for this</text>
  <text start="442.31" dur="8">to happen but remember who drives the</text>
  <text start="446.06" dur="6.789">true economy the people the countries if</text>
  <text start="450.31" dur="9.52">countries decide</text>
  <text start="452.849" dur="12.96">China Russia Turkey Venezuela Syria Iran</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="10.299">India and many others if they decide Wow</text>
  <text start="465.809" dur="7.32">all we need to do is pay everything</text>
  <text start="470.129" dur="5.79">anyone or just use do you want instead</text>
  <text start="473.129" dur="5.19">of the dollar because it makes more</text>
  <text start="475.919" dur="7.05">sense for us to do this it&amp;#39;s lower in</text>
  <text start="478.319" dur="6.36">cost and whatnot the dollar would be</text>
  <text start="482.969" dur="3.93">pushed to the side now if the European</text>
  <text start="484.679" dur="4.2">countries start to do this and we can</text>
  <text start="486.899" dur="3.99">see this could be a huge possibility</text>
  <text start="488.879" dur="7.861">because we can see that the EU is going</text>
  <text start="490.889" dur="8.82">to be purchasing oil from Iran using the</text>
  <text start="496.74" dur="7.469">euro instead of the dollar if the</text>
  <text start="499.709" dur="6.531">Chinese or Iran or Russia say listen we</text>
  <text start="504.209" dur="5.79">rather you use the petrol you won and</text>
  <text start="506.24" dur="8.2">Europe agrees to this this just</text>
  <text start="509.999" dur="6.78">accelerates the entire thing and with</text>
  <text start="514.44" dur="5.129">this short period of time where the you</text>
  <text start="516.779" dur="6.48">won the petrol you won has soared to 12%</text>
  <text start="519.569" dur="7.411">of global trading this would increase it</text>
  <text start="523.259" dur="8.541">tenfold and it won&amp;#39;t take as long as</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="8.219">everyone thinks how quickly did it take</text>
  <text start="531.8" dur="6.7">the world to start using the petro</text>
  <text start="535.199" dur="5.82">dollar they made an announcement they</text>
  <text start="538.5" dur="5.67">prepared everything they made the switch</text>
  <text start="541.019" dur="5.01">in the 70s and eventually all the</text>
  <text start="544.17" dur="3.75">countries because they realized like oh</text>
  <text start="546.029" dur="3.691">if I want to buy oil I have to use the</text>
  <text start="547.92" dur="5.159">dollar because they&amp;#39;re only selling the</text>
  <text start="549.72" dur="6.419">oil in the dollar if the Middle East</text>
  <text start="553.079" dur="5.61">right now works with China and Russia</text>
  <text start="556.139" dur="5.101">and China Russia say listen only sell</text>
  <text start="558.689" dur="4.77">your oil using the you want isn&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="561.24" dur="3.99">what the United States did the deep</text>
  <text start="563.459" dur="4.411">state isn&amp;#39;t what they did the central</text>
  <text start="565.23" dur="5.669">bankers only use the yuan for oil trade</text>
  <text start="567.87" dur="5.43">guess what every country has to do they</text>
  <text start="570.899" dur="4.56">have to start switching and they can do</text>
  <text start="573.3" dur="5.539">this very slowly they can say in the</text>
  <text start="575.459" dur="7.141">beginning listen except both and</text>
  <text start="578.839" dur="5.591">eventually remove the dollar and it</text>
  <text start="582.6" dur="4.02">looks like this is where they are headed</text>
  <text start="584.43" dur="4.59">and the yuan</text>
  <text start="586.62" dur="4.95">we then went out over the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="589.02" dur="4.17">and this is why countries are asking for</text>
  <text start="591.57" dur="2.64">their goal back right now because they</text>
  <text start="593.19" dur="4.02">see the writing on the wall they</text>
  <text start="594.21" dur="4.68">understand that the system is going to</text>
  <text start="597.21" dur="3.87">break down very very quickly it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="598.89" dur="5.52">gonna take that long it&amp;#39;s not gonna take</text>
  <text start="601.08" dur="7.4">20-30 years I would say in the next five</text>
  <text start="604.41" dur="6.99">years we&amp;#39;ll be on the Petra you want I</text>
  <text start="608.48" dur="5.11">don&amp;#39;t even think it&amp;#39;s going to take that</text>
  <text start="611.4" dur="4.32">long because as we can see already it</text>
  <text start="613.59" dur="4.17">has 12 percent of the market in another</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="3.87">year it might have 25 percent of the</text>
  <text start="617.76" dur="3.66">market in another year it might have 50</text>
  <text start="619.59" dur="5.13">percent of the market at that point the</text>
  <text start="621.42" dur="5.73">dollar dies too I and while this is</text>
  <text start="624.72" dur="3.9">happening here in the United States</text>
  <text start="627.15" dur="4.98">things are gonna rapidly deteriorate</text>
  <text start="628.62" dur="6">very very quickly or we have a collapse</text>
  <text start="632.13" dur="4.62">of the entire system which is a bigger</text>
  <text start="634.62" dur="4.68">possibility and they decide you know</text>
  <text start="636.75" dur="5.22">something let&amp;#39;s just switch over to the</text>
  <text start="639.3" dur="6.02">petrol yuyuan because the dollar huge</text>
  <text start="641.97" dur="5.79">amount of debt it&amp;#39;s worth nothing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="645.32" dur="4.48">collapsing right now there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="647.76" dur="4.08">to have it I think this is the move at</text>
  <text start="649.8" dur="4.26">this point is to have all these</text>
  <text start="651.84" dur="4.29">different countries have both in reserve</text>
  <text start="654.06" dur="4.35">so they can switch at a moment&amp;#39;s notice</text>
  <text start="656.13" dur="4.77">so I don&amp;#39;t even think it&amp;#39;s gonna take</text>
  <text start="658.41" dur="3.87">that long to do this and I think this is</text>
  <text start="660.9" dur="3.78">going to be used on a very high level</text>
  <text start="662.28" dur="5.13">for countries and we can see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="664.68" dur="4.47">headed in this direction so everyone</text>
  <text start="667.41" dur="3.63">needs to be prepared and ready for what</text>
  <text start="669.15" dur="3.87">is coming so I think on a lower level</text>
  <text start="671.04" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re gonna have crypto currencies to</text>
  <text start="673.02" dur="3.57">make it easier for transactions because</text>
  <text start="674.64" dur="3.36">you wouldn&amp;#39;t you know use the wand and</text>
  <text start="676.59" dur="3">things like that I think crypto currency</text>
  <text start="678" dur="3.09">is going to be on a very low level and I</text>
  <text start="679.59" dur="3.96">think on a higher level</text>
  <text start="681.09" dur="3.72">I think countries will purchase the yuan</text>
  <text start="683.55" dur="3.75">and things like that that will be on a</text>
  <text start="684.81" dur="4.95">higher level for countries to have trade</text>
  <text start="687.3" dur="3.99">almost like today think about it the</text>
  <text start="689.76" dur="4.29">countries around the world on a high</text>
  <text start="691.29" dur="4.83">level have the petro dollar they use</text>
  <text start="694.05" dur="4.5">this for trade for oil and things like</text>
  <text start="696.12" dur="5.07">that on our lower level they have their</text>
  <text start="698.55" dur="4.53">own personal currencies and they use</text>
  <text start="701.19" dur="3.78">that for transactions and trade within</text>
  <text start="703.08" dur="4.32">their countries the same things going to</text>
  <text start="704.97" dur="4.44">happen now the petrol yuan will be on a</text>
  <text start="707.4" dur="4.77">high level there&amp;#39;ll be the reserve</text>
  <text start="709.41" dur="5.46">currency and on a lower level the</text>
  <text start="712.17" dur="5.1">countries instead of using currencies</text>
  <text start="714.87" dur="5.25">from the central bank they&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="717.27" dur="3.29">currencies created out of mining with</text>
  <text start="720.12" dur="2.39">crypto</text>
  <text start="720.56" dur="4.68">Jonesy&amp;#39;s and they can use this for</text>
  <text start="722.51" dur="4.62">transactions it&amp;#39;s almost what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="725.24" dur="5.19">doing today but we&amp;#39;re removing the</text>
  <text start="727.13" dur="4.53">central bank from all of this and in</text>
  <text start="730.43" dur="4.2">each one of these countries you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="731.66" dur="5.1">need a private western central bank it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="734.63" dur="3.6">just not needed at this point and this</text>
  <text start="736.76" dur="3.12">is what the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="738.23" dur="3.84">is very worried about even with the</text>
  <text start="739.88" dur="4.83">petrol you won there&amp;#39;s no reason to have</text>
  <text start="742.07" dur="6.06">the private western central bank create</text>
  <text start="744.71" dur="6.569">it the Chinese government can create it</text>
  <text start="748.13" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s no reason for the private wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="751.279" dur="4.741">central bank to create something out of</text>
  <text start="752.93" dur="5.49">thin air with interest attached so we</text>
  <text start="756.02" dur="6.18">can see there is a push to move away</text>
  <text start="758.42" dur="6.06">from the central banking system that we</text>
  <text start="762.2" dur="5.94">see today and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="764.48" dur="6.99">that big of a change when we use the</text>
  <text start="768.14" dur="5.91">petrol yuan and cryptocurrencies the</text>
  <text start="771.47" dur="4.98">change that we will see is that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="774.05" dur="5.34">is going to have to adjust the world</text>
  <text start="776.45" dur="5.22">will have to adjust to this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="779.39" dur="4.38">gonna go through some pain some bumps</text>
  <text start="781.67" dur="3.51">and things like that just like we did</text>
  <text start="783.77" dur="2.819">when we came off the gold standard on to</text>
  <text start="785.18" dur="3.42">the petro dollar but we were the reserve</text>
  <text start="786.589" dur="4.981">currency of the world but we did go</text>
  <text start="788.6" dur="5.76">through some trying times this is going</text>
  <text start="791.57" dur="5.64">to be a little bit harder because we</text>
  <text start="794.36" dur="5.76">were we&amp;#39;re used to a certain lifestyle</text>
  <text start="797.21" dur="4.65">and that is going to change so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="800.12" dur="3.12">going to need to be ready and prepared</text>
