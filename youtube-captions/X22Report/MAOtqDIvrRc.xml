  <text start="131.819" dur="4.321">know the economies are struggling China</text>
  <text start="134.04" dur="5.07">is struggling right now there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>

  <text start="152.819" dur="9.03">Australia is saying that there is a</text>
  <text start="154.819" dur="9.091">lower growth happening in Australia the</text>
  <text start="161.849" dur="5.991">economy is slowing</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="8.1">and unemployment is rising and could</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="5.76">increase further and right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.01" dur="4.14">unemployment is at six point two percent</text>

  <text start="186.74" dur="5.67">to feel this this is like a domino</text>
  <text start="190.19" dur="4.44">effect it is spreading everywhere and</text>
  <text start="192.41" dur="4.95">most likely the United States will be</text>
  <text start="194.63" dur="4.2">the last country to completely implode</text>
  <text start="197.36" dur="5.37">on itself this is how it happened in</text>
  <text start="198.83" dur="5.7">1929 Europe was a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="202.73" dur="3.87">everyone thought that everything was</text>
  <text start="204.53" dur="4.26">fine here in the United States into the</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="7.68">last second when everything just</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="8.28">completely fell apart now in Oregon we</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="8.34">see that they&amp;#39;re releasing the names of</text>
  <text start="217.07" dur="8.85">the victims we also see the sheriff said</text>
  <text start="222.62" dur="6.12">that the gunman killed himself well</text>
  <text start="225.92" dur="5.19">there&amp;#39;s another check off box the killer</text>
  <text start="228.74" dur="4.92">committed suicide this is their official</text>
  <text start="231.11" dur="5.22">statement the medical examiner had</text>
  <text start="233.66" dur="6.69">determined suicide as the cause of death</text>
  <text start="236.33" dur="8.9">and the sheriff came on and said that</text>
  <text start="240.35" dur="8.16">they neutralized Chris Harper Mercer and</text>
  <text start="245.23" dur="8.17">after they nutri not neutralized him he</text>
  <text start="248.51" dur="7.35">committed suicide now we see we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="253.4" dur="5.48">checking off the boxes of the script</text>
  <text start="255.86" dur="5.7">that false flags kind of adhere to and</text>
  <text start="258.88" dur="5.32">we&amp;#39;re missing the manifesto and guess</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="5.93">what everybody it looks like Chris</text>
  <text start="264.2" dur="7.32">Harper Mercer handed a thumb drive</text>
  <text start="267.49" dur="5.65">containing a possible manifesto to one</text>
  <text start="271.52" dur="3.18">of the students before opening fire now</text>
  <text start="273.14" dur="5.18">of course they&amp;#39;re not releasing the name</text>
  <text start="274.7" dur="9.27">of the person who he handed it to and</text>
  <text start="278.32" dur="8.23">right now in this thumb drive they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.97" dur="5.73">saying that you know he expressed racial</text>
  <text start="286.55" dur="6.179">and social hatred and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="6.15">through all the information so we can</text>
  <text start="292.729" dur="4.56">check that box off he had a manifesto</text>
  <text start="295.85" dur="3.959">now as they</text>
  <text start="297.289" dur="4.261">release the names today I was looking</text>
  <text start="299.809" dur="3.151">through google to see all these images</text>
  <text start="301.55" dur="3.199">it&amp;#39;s very hard to find their Facebook</text>
  <text start="302.96" dur="4.679">pages it&amp;#39;s like they don&amp;#39;t exist and</text>
  <text start="304.749" dur="4.331">then you find a few photos and of course</text>
  <text start="307.639" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;ve been uploaded in the last you</text>
  <text start="309.08" dur="7.679">know 10 16 hours and i was looking at</text>
  <text start="312.889" dur="5.881">lucas able he&amp;#39;s one of the victims and i</text>
  <text start="316.759" dur="4.14">wanted to see him with his family</text>
  <text start="318.77" dur="5.129">because this is where you can tell you</text>
  <text start="320.899" dur="5.281">know if photos are real or fake because</text>
  <text start="323.899" dur="5.311">they have to fit this person into a</text>
  <text start="326.18" dur="5.279">family structure and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="4.65">interesting is that i came across a</text>
  <text start="331.459" dur="3.93">photo it&amp;#39;s outside of the Roseburg high</text>
  <text start="333.86" dur="4.709">school now I have this on the x 22</text>
  <text start="335.389" dur="4.56">report com site and I&amp;#39;m looking at the</text>
  <text start="338.569" dur="3.63">photo and when I first looked at it it</text>
  <text start="339.949" dur="3.81">didn&amp;#39;t look real right off the bat but I</text>
  <text start="342.199" dur="3.96">said okay let me give it the benefit of</text>
  <text start="343.759" dur="4.83">the doubt and then I look closer at it</text>
  <text start="346.159" dur="4.951">and I&amp;#39;m looking at the shadows on the</text>
  <text start="348.589" dur="4.2">individuals and they don&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="3.149">sense whatsoever because the shadows</text>
  <text start="352.789" dur="4.05">from the plants are going one way and</text>
  <text start="354.259" dur="5.761">the Sun light that&amp;#39;s hitting them is</text>
  <text start="356.839" dur="6.48">going the opposite way and they always</text>
  <text start="360.02" dur="5.85">seem to put the person behind everyone</text>
  <text start="363.319" dur="4.62">else because i use Photoshop quite a bit</text>
  <text start="365.87" dur="5.159">as you can tell from all my pictures on</text>
  <text start="367.939" dur="4.801">my videos and I usually you know put</text>
  <text start="371.029" dur="3.57">someone behind someone or things like</text>
  <text start="372.74" dur="3.87">that to make it look good and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="374.599" dur="4.35">looking at this and I see they put this</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="7.109">person behind or you put them you know</text>
  <text start="378.949" dur="6.12">away from them or in front of them so I</text>
  <text start="383.719" dur="3.391">said okay that&amp;#39;s kind of strange the</text>
  <text start="385.069" dur="4.56">shadows don&amp;#39;t match up and then I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="6.809">looking at it and I said let me pull up</text>
  <text start="389.629" dur="6.57">a photo of the school itself to see if</text>
  <text start="393.919" dur="5.61">there&amp;#39;s any you know things that look a</text>
  <text start="396.199" dur="5.93">little different and i put the side to</text>
  <text start="399.529" dur="5.551">side on the site and i see the flagpole</text>
  <text start="402.129" dur="7.09">the flagpole is not in the right</text>
  <text start="405.08" dur="5.729">position now though the picture of the</text>
  <text start="409.219" dur="4.28">school that i have without the family</text>
  <text start="410.809" dur="5.85">the flagpole is very close to the brick</text>
  <text start="413.499" dur="5.741">structure of the wall when you look at</text>
  <text start="416.659" dur="6.78">the flagpole that was taken with the</text>
  <text start="419.24" dur="8.969">family it&amp;#39;s moved over to the left so</text>
  <text start="423.439" dur="6.78">that doesn&amp;#39;t line up and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem</text>
  <text start="428.209" dur="3.571">like when you&amp;#39;re looking at this this</text>
  <text start="430.219" dur="6.841">photo is real</text>
  <text start="431.78" dur="8.31">all it looks completely fake now we know</text>
  <text start="437.06" dur="6.69">that Obama just one day after the</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="5.64">shooting Obama was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="443.75" dur="4.62">we should be more like Australia like</text>
  <text start="445.73" dur="6.27">the UK have the same type of gun laws</text>
  <text start="448.37" dur="7.019">collect everyone&amp;#39;s guns well Australia</text>
  <text start="452" dur="8.46">just had a shooting and it looks like</text>
  <text start="455.389" dur="9.871">two people died and the gunman opened</text>
  <text start="460.46" dur="8.25">fired outside a daycare and we can see</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="8.01">at this point in time that whatever gun</text>
  <text start="468.71" dur="7.58">laws they push at us it is not going to</text>
  <text start="473.27" dur="7.17">stop people from getting weapons</text>
  <text start="476.29" dur="6.879">illegally all this does is stop the</text>
  <text start="480.44" dur="5.61">everyday citizen who abides by the law</text>
  <text start="483.169" dur="6.021">from getting a weapon remember back in</text>
  <text start="486.05" dur="6.179">the 20s when they had the prohibition</text>
  <text start="489.19" dur="7.33">where you know nobody could get the</text>
  <text start="492.229" dur="7.321">liquor now were they able to wipe liquor</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="5.55">out of the picture no there was the</text>
  <text start="499.55" dur="4.44">black market actually politicians the</text>
  <text start="502.07" dur="4.02">very wealthy they were able to get all</text>
  <text start="503.99" dur="5.989">the liquor they wanted but the everyday</text>
  <text start="506.09" dur="6.96">person was not able to get it unless</text>
  <text start="509.979" dur="5.801">they knew someone and they had a contact</text>
  <text start="513.05" dur="5.22">but if we look at it the everyday person</text>
  <text start="515.78" dur="4.559">did not get it now we see in the</text>
  <text start="518.27" dur="5.1">gun-free zones like Chicago and all</text>
  <text start="520.339" dur="5.161">these other places we see that gun</text>
  <text start="523.37" dur="4.41">violence is on the rise because</text>
  <text start="525.5" dur="4.8">criminals those people who get the</text>
  <text start="527.78" dur="5.64">illegal firearms always find out a way</text>
  <text start="530.3" dur="6.69">of getting it and they know these people</text>
  <text start="533.42" dur="7.2">are not armed so it&amp;#39;s easier to rob them</text>
  <text start="536.99" dur="6.09">to kill them and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="540.62" dur="7.01">seeing if you notice all these shootings</text>
  <text start="543.08" dur="9.75">always take place in the gun-free zones</text>
  <text start="547.63" dur="6.94">now out in Ukraine we see the Donetsk</text>
  <text start="552.83" dur="4.47">and Lugansk people they&amp;#39;re withdrawing</text>
  <text start="554.57" dur="3.9">their tanks they&amp;#39;re bringing them back</text>
  <text start="557.3" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;re bringing back their 100</text>
  <text start="558.47" dur="4.26">millimeter caliber weapons from the</text>
  <text start="559.94" dur="5.43">conflict zone and Kiev right now is</text>
  <text start="562.73" dur="7.38">still humming and hawing</text>
  <text start="565.37" dur="7.44">and the spokesman Dmitry Peskov is</text>
  <text start="570.11" dur="4.5">saying that Kiev is continually delaying</text>
  <text start="572.81" dur="4.86">implementation of the Minsk Accords and</text>
  <text start="574.61" dur="4.89">it shows the ukraine government is not</text>
  <text start="577.67" dur="4.02">motivated to resolve the crisis in the</text>
  <text start="579.5" dur="3.18">country now the people in the Donetsk</text>
  <text start="581.69" dur="3.36">and Lugansk area is saying that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="582.68" dur="5.49">going to have to extend this past 2015</text>
  <text start="585.05" dur="6.78">into 2016 we have not heard from Ukraine</text>
  <text start="588.17" dur="5.79">all we&amp;#39;ve all we&amp;#39;ve heard from them is</text>
  <text start="591.83" dur="5.699">the troops are not going to be removed</text>
  <text start="593.96" dur="5.64">from the contact line we heard from the</text>
  <text start="597.529" dur="3.451">US saying that the Minsk agreement is</text>
  <text start="599.6" dur="4.23">the only agreement and if it does not</text>
  <text start="600.98" dur="4.47">work out well that&amp;#39;s it and we</text>
  <text start="603.83" dur="4.32">understand that it does expire at the</text>
  <text start="605.45" dur="5.76">end of this year we see the United</text>
  <text start="608.15" dur="6.02">States bombed a hospital in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="611.21" dur="7.62">which killed nine civilians and injured</text>
  <text start="614.17" dur="7.859">37 and we&amp;#39;re getting word that yes it</text>
  <text start="618.83" dur="5.79">was confirmed they actually did bomb a</text>
  <text start="622.029" dur="6.821">hospital but of course what do they call</text>
  <text start="624.62" dur="7.38">it collateral damage these were innocent</text>
  <text start="628.85" dur="4.859">people who died and it was a hospital</text>
  <text start="632" dur="3.66">how don&amp;#39;t you know that it was a</text>
  <text start="633.709" dur="4.831">hospital and this was for Doctors</text>
  <text start="635.66" dur="7.83">Without Borders in the Afghan city of</text>
  <text start="638.54" dur="7.44">Kunduz so we can see right now when we</text>
  <text start="643.49" dur="5.94">look at what Obama&amp;#39;s said about the mass</text>
  <text start="645.98" dur="7.14">shooting he&amp;#39;s killing people because</text>
  <text start="649.43" dur="7.76">these are on his orders all over the</text>

  <text start="693.49" dur="5.35">so right now they&amp;#39;re using the Islamic</text>
  <text start="696.2" dur="4.44">state to keep the people away</text>
  <text start="698.84" dur="5.25">from the port remember they moved the</text>

  <text start="704.09" dur="4.11">moved it away hoping that other</text>

  <text start="708.2" dur="6.6">puppet government in purchasing the oil</text>
  <text start="711.25" dur="5.08">but under the constitution of Libya the</text>
