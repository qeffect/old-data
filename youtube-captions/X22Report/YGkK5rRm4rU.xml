  <text start="60.55" dur="5.91">date is July 27th 2018 and the top of</text>
  <text start="63.85" dur="6.45">the episode is the economy just went</text>
  <text start="66.46" dur="6.39">into overdrive or did it let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="70.3" dur="4.92">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="72.85" dur="4.769">the economic illusion it is continuing</text>
  <text start="75.22" dur="5.16">and we&amp;#39;re seeing numbers come out</text>
  <text start="77.619" dur="5.191">showing us how great the economy is now</text>
  <text start="80.38" dur="4.56">this is just one gigantic illusion what</text>
  <text start="82.81" dur="4.29">is happening here the numbers the</text>
  <text start="84.94" dur="4.95">calculations that were used before they</text>
  <text start="87.1" dur="6.21">are being put into overdrive right now</text>
  <text start="89.89" dur="6.21">to push this entire system to the edge</text>
  <text start="93.31" dur="4.46">because the main plan here is to get rid</text>
  <text start="96.1" dur="5.07">of the central bank to reshape the</text>
  <text start="97.77" dur="5.59">entire economic structure and when we</text>
  <text start="101.17" dur="4.35">start looking at real information and</text>
  <text start="103.36" dur="4.88">real data the real numbers we can see</text>
  <text start="105.52" dur="4.92">that the economy is declining rapidly</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="4.39">statistical numbers you can make them</text>
  <text start="110.44" dur="4.319">any way you want them to be it makes no</text>
  <text start="112.63" dur="4.5">difference because wait to do is revise</text>
  <text start="114.759" dur="3.78">change leave something out and you can</text>
  <text start="117.13" dur="3.87">make anything look great and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="118.539" dur="4.11">is happening right now now if we look at</text>
  <text start="121" dur="3.649">durable goods what do we see happening</text>
  <text start="122.649" dur="4.351">well after two months of declines</text>
  <text start="124.649" dur="5.86">durable good orders were expected to</text>
  <text start="127" dur="5.73">rebound incredibly in June they did not</text>
  <text start="130.509" dur="5.041">they thought they were going to get a 3%</text>
  <text start="132.73" dur="6.81">surge and durable goods and when it came</text>
  <text start="135.55" dur="6.21">out it was a meager 1% now when we start</text>
  <text start="139.54" dur="3.419">to look at this we have to look at why</text>
  <text start="141.76" dur="5.01">did this happen</text>
  <text start="142.959" dur="6.621">well it was from the military industrial</text>
  <text start="146.77" dur="6.21">complex they saw a rise of 20%</text>
  <text start="149.58" dur="5.019">month-on-month remember durable goods</text>
  <text start="152.98" dur="3.57">are those big ticket items washers</text>
  <text start="154.599" dur="3.691">dryers things like that and we are</text>
  <text start="156.55" dur="3.54">definitely not seeing that people are</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="4.65">not going out and purchasing these items</text>
  <text start="160.09" dur="6">so this number right here is showing us</text>
  <text start="162.94" dur="5.04">that the people they&amp;#39;re not going out</text>
  <text start="166.09" dur="3.84">and purchasing the big-ticket items yes</text>
  <text start="167.98" dur="3.3">if you include military spending it</text>
  <text start="169.93" dur="3.96">looks fantastic</text>
  <text start="171.28" dur="3.12">just like with retail when gas prices go</text>
  <text start="173.89" dur="2.73">up</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="5.22">they say retail is doing a lot better</text>
  <text start="176.62" dur="5.52">but really is it no it is not if we look</text>
  <text start="179.62" dur="5.039">at housing we see housing is falling</text>
  <text start="182.14" dur="4.049">apart around the world and if we look at</text>
  <text start="184.659" dur="2.351">Canada right now we see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="186.189" dur="4.511">national</text>
  <text start="187.01" dur="7.47">slowed-down national home sales fell 11%</text>
  <text start="190.7" dur="5.7">year-over-year in June sales dipped so</text>
  <text start="194.48" dur="4.619">did the total amount spent on real</text>
  <text start="196.4" dur="5.28">estate the total dollar volume dipped</text>
  <text start="199.099" dur="6.841">12% over a year over year in June</text>
  <text start="201.68" dur="7.08">totaling about 23.5 billion and we can</text>
  <text start="205.94" dur="5.67">see right now with less money spent less</text>
  <text start="208.76" dur="4.41">taxes come in people are trying to sell</text>
  <text start="211.61" dur="4.14">their houses it is not working if we</text>
  <text start="213.17" dur="3.929">look here in the u.s. we see new home</text>
  <text start="215.75" dur="4.95">sales well</text>
  <text start="217.099" dur="4.771">they tumbled to an eight-month low so</text>
  <text start="220.7" dur="4.649">let&amp;#39;s look at some of these numbers here</text>
  <text start="221.87" dur="4.53">in June we saw a 6.7% surge and they</text>
  <text start="225.349" dur="2.911">said wow real estate</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="3.929">it&amp;#39;s incredible new home sales it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.26" dur="3.42">fantastic and then all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="230.329" dur="2.841">went back and they revised the numbers</text>
  <text start="231.68" dur="4.949">now they&amp;#39;re at three point nine percent</text>
  <text start="233.17" dur="6.34">so June tumbled 5.3 percent</text>
  <text start="236.629" dur="4.771">month-on-month well below expectations</text>

  <text start="241.4" dur="4.649">in new home sales since December 2017</text>
  <text start="243.829" dur="5.49">and this also follows a plunge in</text>
  <text start="246.049" dur="5.16">housing starts in June demand weakened</text>
  <text start="249.319" dur="3.51">in three of the four US regions</text>
  <text start="251.209" dur="3.601">including a seven point seven percent</text>
  <text start="252.829" dur="5.31">drop in the south this is the largest</text>

  <text start="277.639" dur="4.741">expected now we know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="280.07" dur="4.77">statistical manipulation that they keep</text>
  <text start="282.38" dur="5.099">you know using to revise these numbers</text>
  <text start="284.84" dur="3.87">to make the numbers look better but we</text>
  <text start="287.479" dur="3.69">see what&amp;#39;s happening with the home</text>

  <text start="303.349" dur="4.051">narrative affordability rising rates and</text>
  <text start="305.87" dur="4.89">shrinking pool of potential home buyers</text>
  <text start="307.4" dur="5.94">who can qualify for conforming mortgages</text>
  <text start="310.76" dur="4.26">has torpedo demand the latest you</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="4.889">Michigan consumer sentiment report</text>
  <text start="315.02" dur="5.84">featured a chart that says home buying</text>
  <text start="318.229" dur="4.521">sentiment is declining</text>
  <text start="320.86" dur="3.959">because people realize on the front</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="4.74">lines what is happening right now people</text>
  <text start="324.819" dur="6.241">understand like okay my house price is</text>
  <text start="327.49" dur="5.82">going down why should I sell it now the</text>
  <text start="331.06" dur="4.409">mortgage rates are going up I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="333.31" dur="4.129">getting raises in orc or I lost my job</text>
  <text start="335.469" dur="5.85">and right now I can&amp;#39;t purchase a house</text>
  <text start="337.439" dur="6.19">so as you can see the consumer sentiment</text>
  <text start="341.319" dur="6">toward buying a home is at its lowest</text>
  <text start="343.629" dur="5.34">reading since 2008 this is not a fact</text>
  <text start="347.319" dur="3.66">that would ever show up in the</text>
  <text start="348.969" dur="4.021">mainstream financial reporting on the</text>
  <text start="350.979" dur="3.72">housing market they don&amp;#39;t talk really</text>
  <text start="352.99" dur="3.57">talk about this they don&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="354.699" dur="3.421">to really know what is going on they</text>
  <text start="356.56" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t want people to understand that the</text>
  <text start="358.12" dur="5.31">housing market is rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="360.58" dur="4.619">and it just didn&amp;#39;t start today this has</text>
  <text start="363.43" dur="3.93">been ongoing remember what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="365.199" dur="6.421">the central bankers have pushed up a</text>
  <text start="367.36" dur="6.299">bubble in 20 cities by keeping houses</text>
  <text start="371.62" dur="4.199">off the market by having investment</text>
  <text start="373.659" dur="3.901">companies come in and purchase you know</text>
  <text start="375.819" dur="4.41">thousands upon thousands of houses</text>
  <text start="377.56" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re told to hold on to it banks they</text>
  <text start="380.229" dur="3.9">didn&amp;#39;t foreclose on homes they told</text>
  <text start="382" dur="3.24">people they can live there they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="384.129" dur="3.241">want to put them back on the market</text>
  <text start="385.24" dur="4.079">because more houses on the market lump</text>
  <text start="387.37" dur="3.81">then you can&amp;#39;t drive the price up less</text>
  <text start="389.319" dur="4.4">houses on the market you can drive the</text>
  <text start="391.18" dur="6.09">prices up that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="393.719" dur="6.91">now it looks like Trump has a big win</text>
  <text start="397.27" dur="6.59">with Europe they agreed to work toward</text>
  <text start="400.629" dur="5.361">zero tariffs and we see right now</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="5.019">European Commissioner President</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="5.769">jean-claude juncker met with Trump and</text>
  <text start="408.879" dur="5.85">they are talking about having zero</text>
  <text start="411.759" dur="5.46">tariffs right now so it looks like</text>
  <text start="414.729" dur="6.9">things are moving in a completely</text>
  <text start="417.219" dur="7.111">different direction and those people who</text>
  <text start="421.629" dur="6.06">are not really elected they are moving</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="5.79">towards what Trump really wants now this</text>
  <text start="427.689" dur="5.07">is not going to be easy as we can see</text>
  <text start="430.12" dur="4.409">it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult as we</text>
  <text start="432.759" dur="4.02">move forward because the central bankers</text>
  <text start="434.529" dur="5.551">they&amp;#39;re not just going to give all of it</text>
  <text start="436.779" dur="5.25">away they want control and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="440.08" dur="5.67">trying to figure out a way to keep</text>
  <text start="442.029" dur="6.48">control and this is why the entire</text>
  <text start="445.75" dur="5.19">system needs to be brought to the edge I</text>
  <text start="448.509" dur="5.031">mean think about it what happened today</text>
  <text start="450.94" dur="5.12">the GDP numbers came out</text>
  <text start="453.54" dur="6.18">and they&amp;#39;re telling us that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.06" dur="5.94">around 4% or so and everyone&amp;#39;s going wow</text>
  <text start="459.72" dur="3.93">the economy just it&amp;#39;s incredible it just</text>
  <text start="462" dur="3.36">done a lot better than anyone ever</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="3.27">thought we&amp;#39;ve never hit 4% when was the</text>
  <text start="465.36" dur="4.62">last time we had four present there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="466.92" dur="5.22">long time ago and when we really look at</text>
  <text start="469.98" dur="5.64">it what they&amp;#39;ve done is they played with</text>
  <text start="472.14" dur="6.39">the numbers if we look at one aspect of</text>
  <text start="475.62" dur="6.78">today&amp;#39;s GDP report that was completely</text>
  <text start="478.53" dur="7.02">ignored was the wide-ranging revision to</text>
  <text start="482.4" dur="5.97">historical data that the be EA released</text>
  <text start="485.55" dur="6.45">alongside the latest numbers what it</text>
  <text start="488.37" dur="5.58">showed was a doozy on a chained real</text>
  <text start="492" dur="4.29">dollar basis the US economy was</text>
  <text start="493.95" dur="4.05">estimated to have reached 18 point five</text>
  <text start="496.29" dur="4.92">trillion level in the second quarter of</text>
  <text start="498" dur="6.54">2018 now if we put this number in</text>
  <text start="501.21" dur="5.28">context the last pre revision number was</text>
  <text start="504.54" dur="5.09">seventeen point three seven trillion as</text>
  <text start="506.49" dur="6.48">of the first quarter of this year and</text>
  <text start="509.63" dur="6.61">now it was revised to eighteen point</text>
  <text start="512.97" dur="5.49">three trillion this means that the B EA</text>
  <text start="516.24" dur="6.81">has revised he was economy to be one</text>
  <text start="518.46" dur="8.6">trillion higher to pull this 4% GDP</text>
  <text start="523.05" dur="7.68">number out I mean the revision is</text>
  <text start="527.06" dur="6.25">unbelievable and of course what they did</text>
  <text start="530.73" dur="4.2">was they manipulated numbers and as we</text>
  <text start="533.31" dur="3.75">look further into this we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="534.93" dur="5.46">see this and this is what this is all</text>
  <text start="537.06" dur="6.57">about they&amp;#39;re using the same scheme the</text>
  <text start="540.39" dur="5.4">same tactics that the other</text>
  <text start="543.63" dur="5.28">administrations used and they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="545.79" dur="6.39">it into overdrive to bring this system</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="7.56">down and we know this from cue cue has</text>
  <text start="552.18" dur="7.02">been telling us now that the Fed is on</text>
  <text start="556.47" dur="5.61">the chopping block changes are going to</text>
  <text start="559.2" dur="5.97">be made and things are going to change</text>
  <text start="562.08" dur="5.46">and remember to get rid of this system</text>
  <text start="565.17" dur="3.81">to get rid of the corruption in Congress</text>
  <text start="567.54" dur="3.27">I mean you can&amp;#39;t get rid of all of it</text>
  <text start="568.98" dur="4.53">but to get rid of a lot of this you need</text>
  <text start="570.81" dur="5.04">to go to the source of the problem and</text>
  <text start="573.51" dur="4.71">the source of the problem of all of this</text>
  <text start="575.85" dur="4.26">is the private western central banks and</text>
  <text start="578.22" dur="5.1">again they&amp;#39;re private they&amp;#39;re a private</text>
  <text start="580.11" dur="5.04">corporation they do things behind closed</text>
  <text start="583.32" dur="3.97">doors nobody can see what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="585.15" dur="4.299">yes they&amp;#39;ll give us certain</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="4.289">reports but as we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="589.449" dur="3.57">feds started to hide data they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="591.579" dur="4.231">okay you know something you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="593.019" dur="4.38">the m3o you know what you don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="595.81" dur="3.209">real yield curve we&amp;#39;ll give you a</text>
  <text start="597.399" dur="3.841">different calculation for a yield curve</text>
  <text start="599.019" dur="5.49">you know what you don&amp;#39;t need to see when</text>
  <text start="601.24" dur="4.649">we&amp;#39;re unloading our balance sheet that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="604.509" dur="5.07">really none of your business</text>
  <text start="605.889" dur="7.26">and as you can see they are hiding this</text>
  <text start="609.579" dur="5.401">information changing this information so</text>
  <text start="613.149" dur="3.63">they are not to be blamed for when the</text>
  <text start="614.98" dur="3">system comes down because that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="616.779" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re going to do and this is why</text>
  <text start="617.98" dur="3.779">Trump was out there and he pointed the</text>
  <text start="619.959" dur="3.331">finger at the Fed saying that you know</text>
  <text start="621.759" dur="3.39">these rates that you&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="623.29" dur="4.32">pushing up it&amp;#39;s not going to help but</text>
  <text start="625.149" dur="4.38">you know best so go ahead and do what</text>
  <text start="627.61" dur="5.159">you&amp;#39;re going to do he kind of set them</text>
  <text start="629.529" dur="6.091">up right there and we know what the Fed</text>
  <text start="632.769" dur="4.231">is about to do we know what they want to</text>
  <text start="635.62" dur="3.36">do they want to bring the system down</text>
  <text start="637" dur="4.47">they want to blame it on Trump remember</text>
  <text start="638.98" dur="5.339">the Fed is made up of the deep state and</text>
  <text start="641.47" dur="5.16">bankers and many other individuals that</text>
  <text start="644.319" dur="4.351">are all combined into one and they all</text>

  <text start="752.269" dur="6.841">the people not for a chosen few and this</text>
  <text start="756.5" dur="5.76">is what it is all about we&amp;#39;re moving in</text>
  <text start="759.11" dur="4.979">this direction but everyone needs to be</text>
  <text start="762.26" dur="3.15">prepared for this because it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="764.089" dur="3.031">to be easy like I&amp;#39;ve been saying for</text>
  <text start="765.41" dur="3.479">quite a while you&amp;#39;re gonna have to have</text>

  <text start="770.089" dur="3.75">on hand I do believe you need some</text>
  <text start="772.01" dur="3.93">crypto currencies gold and silver to</text>
  <text start="773.839" dur="3.721">weather this storm because as we go</text>
  <text start="775.94" dur="4.32">through this transition yes we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="777.56" dur="4.5">see hyperinflation yes we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="780.26" dur="4.35">credit freeze up because as we</text>
  <text start="782.06" dur="4.709">transition it&amp;#39;s gonna change everything</text>
  <text start="784.61" dur="3.539">that we know about the economy today and</text>
  <text start="786.769" dur="3.87">change it into something completely</text>
  <text start="788.149" dur="5.42">different and I do believe there&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="790.639" dur="6.39">new currency things will have to change</text>
  <text start="793.569" dur="7.39">but once it does it will be a lot better</text>
  <text start="797.029" dur="5.581">than it is today and to get through this</text>
  <text start="800.959" dur="3.451">you need to be prepared now for those</text>
  <text start="802.61" dur="4.219">people that aren&amp;#39;t prepared they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="804.41" dur="5.22">gonna struggle a little bit and the</text>
  <text start="806.829" dur="3.94">Patriots and Trump and the rest they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="809.63" dur="4.319">gonna try to make it as easy as possible</text>
  <text start="810.769" dur="5.401">but again he can&amp;#39;t do it on a nationwide</text>
  <text start="813.949" dur="4.681">basis it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s completely impossible so</text>
  <text start="816.17" dur="4.26">people are gonna complain people are</text>
  <text start="818.63" dur="4.53">gonna be very angry people are gonna be</text>
  <text start="820.43" dur="4.29">pissed off and not just with this book</text>
  <text start="823.16" dur="3.539">with many other things that Q has been</text>
  <text start="824.72" dur="3.51">talking about but we all need to be</text>
  <text start="826.699" dur="3.151">ready and prepared for this because as</text>
  <text start="828.23" dur="4.89">we can see things were breaking down</text>
  <text start="829.85" dur="5.52">rapidly the manipulation is really out</text>
  <text start="833.12" dur="4.05">of this world today where they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="835.37" dur="3.3">changing a lot of the information to</text>
  <text start="837.17" dur="3.21">make it look like we&amp;#39;re doing a lot</text>
  <text start="838.67" dur="3.84">better than it really is and of course</text>
  <text start="840.38" dur="3.78">using the same strategy that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="842.51" dur="3.54">been using all along so we can turn</text>
  <text start="844.16" dur="4.44">around and say what have you been doing</text>
  <text start="846.05" dur="4.349">here you&amp;#39;ve been manipulating all these</text>
  <text start="848.6" dur="4.169">numbers to make us think that the</text>
  <text start="850.399" dur="4.5">economy is doing well the central bank</text>
  <text start="852.769" dur="4.55">has been telling us that it&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="854.899" dur="5.37">saying we&amp;#39;re on track we&amp;#39;re on recovery</text>
  <text start="857.319" dur="5.5">everything looks great what went wrong</text>
  <text start="860.269" dur="5.01">let&amp;#39;s take a look at the Fed maybe we</text>
  <text start="862.819" dur="5.82">should audit the Fed and we know that</text>
  <text start="865.279" dur="5.73">Trump will sign that audit bill and once</text>
  <text start="868.639" dur="4.411">he does that it will be game over for</text>
  <text start="871.009" dur="3.901">the central bank because then you can go</text>
  <text start="873.05" dur="3.81">in and take a look at what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="874.91" dur="3.06">doing and once you find out what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="876.86" dur="3.81">been doing and it&amp;#39;s presented to the</text>
  <text start="877.97" dur="4.979">American people guess what happens you</text>
  <text start="880.67" dur="4.289">can remove the Fed you can get the votes</text>
  <text start="882.949" dur="5.39">to say we don&amp;#39;t need them anymore</text>
  <text start="884.959" dur="6.36">there&amp;#39;s no reason or take them over and</text>
  <text start="888.339" dur="5.201">control it make sure it&amp;#39;s not private</text>
  <text start="891.319" dur="4.26">anymore make sure it&amp;#39;s a people central</text>
  <text start="893.54" dur="5.159">bank that creates the currency without</text>
  <text start="895.579" dur="5.641">interest attached which is basically the</text>
  <text start="898.699" dur="5.161">Treasury so we can see things are moving</text>
  <text start="901.22" dur="4.559">in the right direction and we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="903.86" dur="2.88">towards this transition where everyone</text>
