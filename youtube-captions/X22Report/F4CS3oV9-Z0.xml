  <text start="154.68" dur="5.059">going to be major problems this is a</text>
  <text start="156.57" dur="5.93">threat by the central banking system and</text>
  <text start="159.739" dur="5.851">they&amp;#39;re saying if this does happen</text>
  <text start="162.5" dur="7">there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going to be horrific and</text>
  <text start="165.59" dur="7.69">what they&amp;#39;re saying is day one Britain</text>
  <text start="169.5" dur="7.1">most likely will crash and there will be</text>
  <text start="173.28" dur="6.4">shortages there&amp;#39;ll be riots there be</text>
  <text start="176.6" dur="5.66">havoc within the country</text>
  <text start="179.68" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;d be crossed channel disruptions</text>
  <text start="182.26" dur="5.22">for heavy good vehicles and the whole</text>
  <text start="185.98" dur="3.78">thing would be a complete mess now this</text>
  <text start="187.48" dur="3.81">would then spread to the rest of the</text>
  <text start="189.76" dur="4.77">world they wouldn&amp;#39;t be contained in one</text>
  <text start="191.29" dur="5.22">country now of course as we know the</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="6.239">central bankers are very worried about</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="5.58">any country leaving their system they</text>
  <text start="200.769" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t want people to leave the system</text>
  <text start="202.09" dur="5.91">yes they&amp;#39;d be still part of the central</text>
  <text start="204.609" dur="5.97">banking system but to bring the European</text>
  <text start="208" dur="5.01">nations together this would start a</text>
  <text start="210.579" dur="3.99">trend and we know that Italy most likely</text>
  <text start="213.01" dur="4.08">would follow other countries would</text>
  <text start="214.569" dur="4.29">follow and it would hurt their plans</text>
  <text start="217.09" dur="4.079">what what&amp;#39;s basically their plans their</text>
  <text start="218.859" dur="5.22">plans are to have a one-world government</text>
  <text start="221.169" dur="5.66">this is why they started the EU to get</text>
  <text start="224.079" dur="5.52">everyone used to the idea of having a</text>
  <text start="226.829" dur="4.33">currency that can be used in all of</text>
  <text start="229.599" dur="3.75">these different countries within the</text>
  <text start="231.159" dur="4.771">European Union and then this would</text>
  <text start="233.349" dur="4.59">spread to other countries and continue</text>
  <text start="235.93" dur="4.739">on until the whole country is you the</text>
  <text start="237.939" dur="4.95">whole world is using one currency this</text>
  <text start="240.669" dur="5.16">was their plan now if you tie this into</text>
  <text start="242.889" dur="5.611">the TTIP and the TPP this was their</text>
  <text start="245.829" dur="4.681">entire plan to have a one-world</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="3.989">government structure with one currency</text>
  <text start="250.51" dur="4.05">with one central bank handling</text>
  <text start="252.489" dur="4.62">everything and what they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="254.56" dur="4.799">about is all of this completely falling</text>
  <text start="257.109" dur="6.331">apart and they&amp;#39;re making threats right</text>
  <text start="259.359" dur="5.911">now if the UK decides to leave without a</text>
  <text start="263.44" dur="3.9">deal and you can see they&amp;#39;re becoming</text>
  <text start="265.27" dur="4.86">very very desperate here in the US we</text>
  <text start="267.34" dur="4.949">can see that everything is starting to</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="4.4">completely fall apart where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.289" dur="4.56">watching all these different indicators</text>
  <text start="274.53" dur="5.47">telling us that we&amp;#39;re headed for a</text>
  <text start="276.849" dur="6.181">recession collapse depression type of</text>
  <text start="280" dur="6.57">scenario and while we&amp;#39;re moving in this</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="5.609">direction we can see that there&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="286.57" dur="4.83">instead of having a couple of different</text>
  <text start="288.639" dur="5.641">classes there&amp;#39;s really two we have the</text>
  <text start="291.4" dur="7.049">wealthy and we have the poor the middle</text>
  <text start="294.28" dur="6.81">class is almost gone and the reason for</text>
  <text start="298.449" dur="4.621">this is because all the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="301.09" dur="5.009">jobs have been moved away from the</text>
  <text start="303.07" dur="6">United States the jobs that were</text>
  <text start="306.099" dur="6.241">high-paying are now low-paying we have a</text>
  <text start="309.07" dur="4.47">lot of service type of jobs here and if</text>
  <text start="312.34" dur="3.9">we look at</text>
  <text start="313.54" dur="5.96">of the signs we can see that yeah the</text>
  <text start="316.24" dur="5.88">middle class it is completely done with</text>
  <text start="319.5" dur="5.23">and we we talked about this yesterday</text>
  <text start="322.12" dur="5.22">about 78 million Americans they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.73" dur="4.29">participating in the economy where they</text>
  <text start="327.34" dur="2.97">have these part-time jobs where they</text>
  <text start="329.02" dur="3.87">have jobs where they&amp;#39;re not making</text>
  <text start="330.31" dur="6.33">enough money and they need to do</text>
  <text start="332.89" dur="6.96">something else to bring in funds to make</text>
  <text start="336.64" dur="5.97">ends meet and this is turning out to be</text>
  <text start="339.85" dur="4.47">a huge problem because a lot of the</text>
  <text start="342.61" dur="6.48">country is turning towards this and</text>
  <text start="344.32" dur="6.84">still it&amp;#39;s not enough money in 2011 the</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="4.92">average home price was about three and a</text>
  <text start="351.16" dur="5.94">half times the average year salary in</text>

  <text start="996.71" dur="4.95">lied to us all this time and show</text>
  <text start="999.47" dur="4.83">everyone that they have lied and the</text>
