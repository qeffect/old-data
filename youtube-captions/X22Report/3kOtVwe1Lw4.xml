  <text start="54.769" dur="4.951">guess what the central bankers wanted it</text>
  <text start="56.87" dur="5.7">to do it is down today and it looks like</text>
  <text start="59.72" dur="5.21">it&amp;#39;s down about 77 points or so we see</text>
  <text start="62.57" dur="5.28">gold has been suppressed once again and</text>
  <text start="64.93" dur="4.09">we can see that most likely the</text>
  <text start="67.85" dur="3.659">suppression will be coming to an end</text>
  <text start="69.02" dur="4.86">very soon they push it down as far as</text>
  <text start="71.509" dur="3.901">they can get it and we can see that most</text>
  <text start="73.88" dur="3.12">likely this will start turning around by</text>
  <text start="75.41" dur="3.27">the end of the week are we going to see</text>
  <text start="77" dur="5.399">huge gains won&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to</text>

  <text start="103.88" dur="5.489">make us feel like everything is</text>
  <text start="107.39" dur="4.47">absolutely fine and this is part of</text>
  <text start="109.369" dur="4.831">their strategy to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="111.86" dur="3.63">that the economy is doing a lot better</text>
  <text start="114.2" dur="3.69">than it really is but we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="115.49" dur="3.87">tracking the economic indicators and</text>
  <text start="117.89" dur="4.71">they are showing that the economy is</text>
  <text start="119.36" dur="6.96">actually getting a lot worse and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.6" dur="7.049">actually speeding up on the downside now</text>
  <text start="126.32" dur="5.28">out in Greece we are seeing that the</text>
  <text start="129.649" dur="6.301">people there are having a very tough</text>
  <text start="131.6" dur="6.99">time the Greek labour ministry well they</text>
  <text start="135.95" dur="4.5">put out a report and they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="138.59" dur="4.44">about inequality during the period of</text>
  <text start="140.45" dur="4.98">twenty ten to twenty fifteen and it</text>
  <text start="143.03" dur="5.61">actually exposes a new social class of</text>
  <text start="145.43" dur="5.25">workers that neo poor Greeks where</text>
  <text start="148.64" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;ve been earning wages must much</text>
  <text start="150.68" dur="5.339">less than the unemployment allowance of</text>
  <text start="152.87" dur="7.619">about 360 euros now according to the</text>

  <text start="186.799" dur="7.08">per month and we can see right now what</text>
  <text start="191.06" dur="5.489">has happened in Greece is a complete</text>
  <text start="193.879" dur="5.61">disaster this is a central banking</text>
  <text start="196.549" dur="5.541">system disaster and we can see the Greek</text>
  <text start="199.489" dur="7.14">government and the lenders and the IMF</text>
  <text start="202.09" dur="7.63">well their next round of bailouts and</text>
  <text start="206.629" dur="8.28">everything else has to do with the Greek</text>
  <text start="209.72" dur="7.32">government using labour reforms and this</text>
  <text start="214.909" dur="4.741">is supposed to occur in September which</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="6.5">is going to create a new disaster in</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="6.38">Greece remember the central banks</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="4.93">they&amp;#39;re not there to help the people</text>
  <text start="226.03" dur="5.919">they&amp;#39;re not here they&amp;#39;re not there to</text>
  <text start="228.47" dur="7.169">help the government their product is</text>
  <text start="231.949" dur="6">debt they want control of the country</text>
  <text start="235.639" dur="4.71">they want them into debt not too far</text>
  <text start="237.949" dur="4.41">into debt but enough debt where they can</text>
  <text start="240.349" dur="4.32">buy their natural resources and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="242.359" dur="4.8">been seeing this happen in many</text>
  <text start="244.669" dur="6.18">different countries we see here in the</text>
  <text start="247.159" dur="5.811">united states that skopos the financial</text>
  <text start="250.849" dur="5.85">company the new king of deep subprime</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="7.689">well things are starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="256.699" dur="6.96">there and we can see that a lot of the</text>
  <text start="260.659" dur="6.661">subprime people who had credit scores</text>
  <text start="263.659" dur="6.171">ranging from 351 to 500 well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="267.32" dur="7.05">having a very tough time paying off</text>
  <text start="269.83" dur="7.709">their loans now mostly it&amp;#39;s auto loans</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="6.06">and we&amp;#39;re seeing delinquencies rise and</text>
  <text start="277.539" dur="6.13">as duncan sees rise what happens is</text>
  <text start="280.43" dur="5.85">these cars are then repossessed and we</text>
  <text start="283.669" dur="4.021">have a major problem and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="286.28" dur="5.19">interesting about this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="7.979">that they&amp;#39;re delaying their earnings due</text>
  <text start="291.47" dur="6.659">to accounting matters so the subprime</text>
  <text start="295.669" dur="7.56">the one of the largest subprime</text>
  <text start="298.129" dur="7.951">lenders there the lane their earnings</text>
  <text start="303.229" dur="5.49">now of course as we know a lot of these</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="4.559">firms they use GAAP accounting they</text>
  <text start="308.719" dur="4.53">manipulate the accounting they make it</text>
  <text start="310.639" dur="4.26">look good almost like Enron and this is</text>
  <text start="313.249" dur="4.65">what we see happening right now now</text>
  <text start="314.899" dur="5.28">caterpillar well that is a complete</text>
  <text start="317.899" dur="5.73">disaster we are saying that caterpillar</text>
  <text start="320.179" dur="7.14">forget recession this is a depression</text>
  <text start="323.629" dur="8.88">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that they</text>
  <text start="327.319" dur="9.03">are now in their 43rd month of declining</text>
  <text start="332.509" dur="7.2">sales during the Great Recession they</text>
  <text start="336.349" dur="6.53">had about 19 months during this great</text>
  <text start="339.709" dur="5.88">recovery they have 43 months of</text>
  <text start="342.879" dur="4.93">declining sales now asia-pacific they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.589" dur="4.5">down seven percent Europe Africa Middle</text>
  <text start="347.809" dur="5.19">East down four percent Latin America</text>
  <text start="350.089" dur="4.89">down 38% North America down twelve</text>
  <text start="352.999" dur="3.81">percent and we&amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="354.979" dur="5.22">completely down by twelve percent at</text>
  <text start="356.809" dur="7.34">this point and this is how it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="360.199" dur="8.46">since the end of 2012 going into 2013</text>
  <text start="364.149" dur="6.78">which shows us that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="368.659" dur="5.4">improving the economy is not improving</text>
  <text start="370.929" dur="7.811">the only thing that is improving is the</text>
  <text start="374.059" dur="6.931">stock market we see the Dallas Fed it is</text>
  <text start="378.74" dur="6">contracted for the 19th straight month</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="7.079">in a row now of course we had it dropped</text>
  <text start="384.74" dur="6.449">to negative 18 it shot back up to</text>
  <text start="388.069" dur="4.921">negative one point eight but the biggest</text>
  <text start="391.189" dur="5.671">driver of the bounce appears to be hope</text>
  <text start="392.99" dur="6.569">about the future of new orders and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="396.86" dur="4.589">not really seeing it so we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="399.559" dur="4.77">that the Fed is remaining in this</text>
  <text start="401.449" dur="7.291">contraction for 19 straight months in a</text>
  <text start="404.329" dur="7.92">row and it looks really bad and what</text>
  <text start="408.74" dur="6.389">we&amp;#39;re seeing from the Dallas Fed some of</text>
  <text start="412.249" dur="4.98">the respondents go something like this</text>
  <text start="415.129" dur="4.26">the computer and electronic product</text>
  <text start="417.229" dur="3.96">manufacturing but they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>

  <text start="425.709" dur="4.86">transportation equipment manufacturing</text>
  <text start="427.819" dur="3.811">the economy is nervous shaky uncertain</text>
  <text start="430.569" dur="4.571">prin</text>
  <text start="431.63" dur="7.14">and related support June has become</text>
  <text start="435.14" dur="5.94">stupid slow for us miscellaneous</text>
  <text start="438.77" dur="4.77">manufacturing we are experiencing major</text>
  <text start="441.08" dur="5.49">demand instabilities in the US the</text>

  <text start="458.72" dur="5.67">economies and the US economy are very</text>
  <text start="460.73" dur="6.12">weak and uncertain and it goes on and on</text>
  <text start="464.39" dur="4.44">and on and this shows us that things are</text>
  <text start="466.85" dur="4.32">not improving we&amp;#39;re seeing the Baltic</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="4.26">Dry Index it is fallen once again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.17" dur="5.1">bringing we&amp;#39;re going down to 709 it</text>
  <text start="473.09" dur="5.37">dropped nine points and most likely by</text>
  <text start="476.27" dur="4.56">tomorrow or the next day we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="3.96">be back in the sixes and remember the</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="4.8">Baltic Dry Index is the raw material</text>
  <text start="482.42" dur="5.6">that&amp;#39;s used for manufacturing and when</text>
  <text start="485.63" dur="4.77">the people are not out there purchasing</text>
  <text start="488.02" dur="5.7">guess what manufacturers don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="490.4" dur="6.27">produce now the both dry index increased</text>
  <text start="493.72" dur="4.3">when the brexit was occurring and now</text>
  <text start="496.67" dur="3.3">we&amp;#39;re seeing it fall again I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="498.02" dur="4.23">remember the Baltic Dry Index it is</text>
  <text start="499.97" dur="5.1">seasonal and we have to remember it this</text>
  <text start="502.25" dur="6.72">is the year that it hit its lowest point</text>
  <text start="505.07" dur="6.96">ever now we can see that the Italian</text>
  <text start="508.97" dur="7.14">banks they are having a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="512.03" dur="6.509">trouble and it is spreading the Italian</text>
  <text start="516.11" dur="5.04">banks need a bailout we know Europe has</text>
  <text start="518.539" dur="5.011">a bell in documentation just like the UK</text>
  <text start="521.15" dur="4.83">just like the u.s. just like New Zealand</text>
  <text start="523.55" dur="5.16">and many other countries and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="525.98" dur="4.23">seeing that the Italian banks used the</text>
  <text start="528.71" dur="4.08">brexit actually I should say the central</text>
  <text start="530.21" dur="5.16">banks use the brexit to bail out the</text>
  <text start="532.79" dur="4.2">Italian banks saying ah this is because</text>
  <text start="535.37" dur="3.51">of the brexit we can do a bailout and</text>
  <text start="536.99" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;ll just bring it blame it on the</text>
  <text start="538.88" dur="4.74">people in the UK and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="541.91" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s allowing the central banks to do</text>
  <text start="543.62" dur="5.1">things that they would really do because</text>
  <text start="546.95" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;d have to explain it away and to</text>
  <text start="548.72" dur="3.96">explain it away at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="550.22" dur="7.77">using the brexit but we&amp;#39;re seeing other</text>
  <text start="552.68" dur="8.85">banks starting to fall apart if you</text>
  <text start="557.99" dur="5.22">remember last December Portugal&amp;#39;s novo</text>
  <text start="561.53" dur="3.42">bank or receive the very unpleasant</text>
  <text start="563.21" dur="3.51">parting</text>
  <text start="564.95" dur="5.43">present to 2015 and it was called a</text>
  <text start="566.72" dur="5.61">bail-in well these banks are already</text>
  <text start="570.38" dur="4.65">under capitalized and loaded with bad</text>
  <text start="572.33" dur="6.42">debt and they&amp;#39;re bracing for even more</text>
  <text start="575.03" dur="5.28">heavy losses some bankers are even</text>
  <text start="578.75" dur="4.41">doubtful that the rescued lender will</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="4.74">attract any acceptable offers which</text>
  <text start="583.16" dur="4.62">means there might be a breakup or a</text>
  <text start="585.05" dur="5.43">liquidation of the bank so we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="587.78" dur="7.02">Italian banks we&amp;#39;re seeing Portuguese</text>
  <text start="590.48" dur="6.75">banks and this is spreading the</text>
  <text start="594.8" dur="4.77">situation is not improving whatsoever</text>
  <text start="597.23" dur="4.26">now we understand that many countries</text>
  <text start="599.57" dur="3.24">have gone negative there are negative</text>
  <text start="601.49" dur="3.81">interest rates we understand Japan</text>
  <text start="602.81" dur="4.28">Europe they&amp;#39;re all in negative interest</text>
  <text start="605.3" dur="6.66">rates and one of the largest Dutch banks</text>
  <text start="607.09" dur="9.91">ABN amro has now warned its business</text>
  <text start="611.96" dur="9.84">clients that their deposits are going to</text>
  <text start="617" dur="8.22">be basically charged they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="621.8" dur="5.94">negative interest rates the bank right</text>
  <text start="625.22" dur="5.58">now is updating its terms and conditions</text>
  <text start="627.74" dur="4.92">and will more specifically include its</text>
  <text start="630.8" dur="4.89">right to reduce the interest rates below</text>
  <text start="632.66" dur="6.27">zero as the bank wants to protect itself</text>
  <text start="635.69" dur="7.22">against the continuous changing market</text>
  <text start="638.93" dur="7.56">circumstances and this is how it starts</text>
  <text start="642.91" dur="5.35">it starts with one bank it moves to</text>
  <text start="646.49" dur="5.46">another they start with business</text>
  <text start="648.26" dur="6.45">accounts actually they start with the</text>
  <text start="651.95" dur="4.68">creditors they move to deposits they</text>
  <text start="654.71" dur="4.23">start with the wealthy and they trickle</text>
  <text start="656.63" dur="5.52">it on down and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="658.94" dur="6.21">right now as this system continually</text>
  <text start="662.15" dur="5.25">deteriorates as the debt continually</text>
  <text start="665.15" dur="5.07">grows as more and more people are</text>
  <text start="667.4" dur="5.58">unemployed as more and more people who</text>
  <text start="670.22" dur="5.19">can get jobs get part-time jobs the</text>
  <text start="672.98" dur="6.03">revenue stream into these governments</text>
  <text start="675.41" dur="6.15">disappears and if they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="679.01" dur="5.37">revenue to keep the economies moving</text>
  <text start="681.56" dur="6.33">along guess what the debt is</text>
  <text start="684.38" dur="8.85">unsustainable so what they need to do is</text>
  <text start="687.89" dur="7.14">bring everything below zero banks they</text>
  <text start="693.23" dur="5.34">need to bring everything below zero so</text>
  <text start="695.03" dur="8.04">they can take the funds from the P</text>
  <text start="698.57" dur="7.2">people to keep the bank operating I mean</text>
  <text start="703.07" dur="6.12">there was a time where banks actually</text>
  <text start="705.77" dur="5.76">gave you money when you put it into</text>
  <text start="709.19" dur="4.11">their banking system now when you put</text>
  <text start="711.53" dur="5.94">money into the banking system they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="713.3" dur="7.58">taking money from you so we can see that</text>
