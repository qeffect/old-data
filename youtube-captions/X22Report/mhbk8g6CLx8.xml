  <text start="114.06" dur="5.46">talk a lot of promises it sounds great</text>
  <text start="116.61" dur="5.13">in the media of course but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="119.52" dur="5.13">really seeing is a lot of retail stores</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="4.559">closing we&amp;#39;re seeing still manufacturers</text>
  <text start="124.65" dur="2.88">closing and we could see already</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="4.171">caterpillar they&amp;#39;re going to be laying</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="5.31">off 800 people from their Aurora</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="5.1">Illinois plant and the reason for this</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="5.13">is because there is a decline in demand</text>
  <text start="135.57" dur="5.01">for their product now we know that</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="4.26">caterpillar it has had a terrible</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="4.17">something like twenty eight months of</text>
  <text start="142.23" dur="5.789">declining sales all around the world and</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="5.13">in some areas they&amp;#39;re non-existent right</text>
  <text start="148.019" dur="3.211">now and we can see through the past</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;ve been laying off many many</text>
  <text start="151.23" dur="4.229">individuals now of course here in the</text>
  <text start="153.12" dur="4.53">United States we see many things to</text>
  <text start="155.459" dur="4.411">cheer rating very very quickly not just</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="3.869">caterpillar around the world it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="4.26">happening here in the United States but</text>
  <text start="161.519" dur="4.231">the manufacturers of automobiles of</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="4.62">course they&amp;#39;re trying to make us believe</text>
  <text start="165.75" dur="4.799">that things are fantastic with them</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="4.17">because they keep coming out with this</text>
  <text start="170.549" dur="3.901">report saying how great auto sales are</text>
  <text start="172.92" dur="4.02">and we have to remember how auto sales</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="5.48">are calculated when those autos are</text>
  <text start="176.94" dur="5.51">delivered to the dealership and they</text>
  <text start="179.93" dur="4.649">stuff there lots with autos those are</text>
  <text start="182.45" dur="3.81">sales that&amp;#39;s what they report on not</text>
  <text start="184.579" dur="4.41">when they sell the car to the individual</text>
  <text start="186.26" dur="5.19">and a lot of these cars again are</text>
  <text start="188.989" dur="5.25">sitting on a lot they can&amp;#39;t move them</text>
  <text start="191.45" dur="4.61">and this is how you know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="194.239" dur="5.09">problem because when automobile</text>
  <text start="196.06" dur="6.129">manufacturers when they start giving out</text>
  <text start="199.329" dur="7.211">gigantic I&amp;#39;m talking gigantic incentives</text>
  <text start="202.189" dur="6.33">to move their inventory this is a signal</text>
  <text start="206.54" dur="4.14">letting you know there&amp;#39;s major problems</text>
  <text start="208.519" dur="5.58">we saw this prior to 2008 where</text>
  <text start="210.68" dur="6.209">incentives got gigantic now TrueCar</text>
  <text start="214.099" dur="5.371">they&amp;#39;re forecasting an increase of about</text>
  <text start="216.889" dur="5.761">point two percent year-over-year of new</text>
  <text start="219.47" dur="5.669">cars and light trucks and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="222.65" dur="4.199">seeing right now when we look closely at</text>
  <text start="225.139" dur="5.13">these numbers on how they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="226.849" dur="6.301">well first of all they&amp;#39;re stuffing the</text>
  <text start="230.269" dur="4.981">Lots with automobiles secondly they need</text>
  <text start="233.15" dur="3.959">to move these automobiles off the Lots</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="5.159">and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been giving</text>
  <text start="237.109" dur="6.451">these tremendous incentives now</text>
  <text start="240.409" dur="6">year-over-year in February sales have</text>
  <text start="243.56" dur="5.009">fallen by 1.1 percent and they also</text>
  <text start="246.409" dur="3.871">edged down in January now the weather</text>
  <text start="248.569" dur="4.26">really wasn&amp;#39;t that bad so it can be very</text>
  <text start="250.28" dur="5.129">difficult to blame this on a very snowy</text>
  <text start="252.829" dur="5.22">februari but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="255.409" dur="5.851">incentives it gives us some idea of</text>
  <text start="258.049" dur="6.921">what&amp;#39;s happening here now GM they</text>
  <text start="261.26" dur="8.07">clocked in over about something like</text>
  <text start="264.97" dur="6.43">5125 dollars per unit in incentives and</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s apparently what it took to get</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="5.699">its sales to rise four percent so they</text>
  <text start="274.25" dur="6.27">had to give up five thousand dollars for</text>
  <text start="277.099" dur="5.431">each automobile for Ford which has been</text>
  <text start="280.52" dur="5.519">priding itself in disciplined approach</text>
  <text start="282.53" dur="5.1">well it&amp;#39;s incentives were around four</text>
  <text start="286.039" dur="4.56">thousand and eleven dollars</text>
  <text start="287.63" dur="4.62">fiat-chrysler same thing they were</text>
  <text start="290.599" dur="5.25">giving out around four thousand three</text>
  <text start="292.25" dur="6.78">hundred sixty dollars $62 per unit so</text>
  <text start="295.849" dur="5.07">when we look at this and we see how this</text>
  <text start="299.03" dur="3.629">affects their business we can see that</text>
  <text start="300.919" dur="6.211">they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing they did</text>
  <text start="302.659" dur="6.87">back in 2006-2007 leading up to two</text>
  <text start="307.13" dur="4.62">thousand eight GM cranked up its</text>
  <text start="309.529" dur="4.291">incentives by twenty one point four</text>
  <text start="311.75" dur="3.99">percent from a year ago</text>
  <text start="313.82" dur="4.74">Honda increased its incentive spending</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="6.63">twenty-seven percent a year ago now if</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="6.39">GM piles on its incentives at this rate</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="5.34">three months in a row it would spend</text>
  <text start="324.95" dur="5.52">nearly four billion on incentives in</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="5.22">just that quarter just in the US alone</text>
  <text start="330.47" dur="4.68">so what are the numbers what do they</text>
  <text start="332.93" dur="4.41">look like when we look very closely at</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="5.91">this well in the first quarter of 2015</text>
  <text start="337.34" dur="6.69">GM reported global net income of 2.0</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="5.76">billion in the first quarter of 2015 a</text>
  <text start="344.03" dur="6.3">reported global net income of point nine</text>
  <text start="346.82" dur="6.6">billion these incentives can eat at</text>
  <text start="350.33" dur="5.7">automakers dollars and cents in no time</text>
  <text start="353.42" dur="3.96">and they did in the years before the</text>
  <text start="356.03" dur="3.27">industry collapsed her in the Great</text>
  <text start="357.38" dur="4.5">Recession so when we look at all these</text>
  <text start="359.3" dur="6.72">numbers they&amp;#39;re really doing the same</text>
  <text start="361.88" dur="5.94">thing that they did prior to 2008 where</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="3.48">they had to go to Congress and they had</text>
  <text start="367.82" dur="3.81">to say listen because of all these</text>
  <text start="369.5" dur="4.8">incentives because we&amp;#39;re so far into</text>
  <text start="371.63" dur="5.73">debt we&amp;#39;re not making a profit we need a</text>
  <text start="374.3" dur="5.88">bailout and they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="377.36" dur="5.25">again I mean what&amp;#39;s the definition of</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="4.08">insanity doing the same thing over and</text>
  <text start="382.61" dur="4.11">over and over and expecting a different</text>
  <text start="384.26" dur="5.01">result this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="386.72" dur="6.6">doing and we could see right now that in</text>
  <text start="389.27" dur="6.39">this economy if they have to resort to</text>
  <text start="393.32" dur="4.89">these drastic measures that means the</text>
  <text start="395.66" dur="4.95">economy isn&amp;#39;t as strong as their as they</text>
  <text start="398.21" dur="6.48">everyone is saying it means that we are</text>
  <text start="400.61" dur="5.67">in major trouble we see Eric rosengren</text>
  <text start="404.69" dur="4.56">the President of the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="6.48">Bank of Boston recently made a startling</text>
  <text start="409.25" dur="5.58">admission we may be in the midst of yet</text>
  <text start="412.76" dur="3.9">another real estate bubble major</text>
  <text start="414.83" dur="4.53">financial institutions in this country</text>
  <text start="416.66" dur="5.61">are in possession of over 14 trillion</text>
  <text start="419.36" dur="5.79">worth of residential real estate loan</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s well over 40,000 for every man</text>
  <text start="425.15" dur="4.5">woman child in America and we can see</text>
  <text start="427.37" dur="6.86">right now from these low interest rates</text>
  <text start="429.65" dur="7.65">by having hedge funds having foreigners</text>
  <text start="434.23" dur="5.83">investment companies come in and take</text>
  <text start="437.3" dur="5.97">this free money from the Fed go out and</text>
  <text start="440.06" dur="5.04">purchase these homes they increased the</text>
  <text start="443.27" dur="4.259">value of homes they created this</text>
  <text start="445.1" dur="5.759">gigantic bubble but look on</text>
  <text start="447.529" dur="6.74">look how they did this it was all fake</text>
  <text start="450.859" dur="6.27">phony and false while in the meantime</text>
  <text start="454.269" dur="6.01">the Fed was buying up a lot of these</text>
  <text start="457.129" dur="5.49">toxic loans this didn&amp;#39;t help the</text>
  <text start="460.279" dur="4.17">situation this just covered it up it</text>
  <text start="462.619" dur="5.19">swept it under the carpet that&amp;#39;s all it</text>
  <text start="464.449" dur="6.06">did we see right now from the Scirocco</text>
  <text start="467.809" dur="6.06">report that the u.s. retirement market</text>
  <text start="470.509" dur="5.58">well it is in big trouble because what</text>
  <text start="473.869" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is annual</text>
  <text start="476.089" dur="5.34">benefits that are paid out are now</text>
  <text start="478.579" dur="4.83">larger than the total contributions and</text>
  <text start="481.429" dur="5.1">we talked about the pensions in depth</text>
  <text start="483.409" dur="5.52">and we are seeing major problems here</text>
  <text start="486.529" dur="4.65">now Americans who have invested in their</text>
  <text start="488.929" dur="4.47">hard-earned money into their 401k and</text>
  <text start="491.179" dur="5.22">had no idea that it was the greatest</text>
  <text start="493.399" dur="4.8">Ponzi scheme in history well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.399" dur="3.99">going to have a huge problem when the</text>
  <text start="498.199" dur="4.74">whole thing comes crumbling down now</text>
  <text start="500.389" dur="5.46">according to the most recent data by the</text>
  <text start="502.939" dur="5.37">IC i-- investment company institute the</text>
  <text start="505.849" dur="5.37">u.s. retirement market balloon to a new</text>
  <text start="508.309" dur="6.691">record high of 25 point three trillion</text>
  <text start="511.219" dur="5.88">at the end of 2016 as Americans continue</text>
  <text start="515" dur="5.039">to contribute into their supposed</text>
  <text start="517.099" dur="5.61">retirement plans few realize that more</text>
  <text start="520.039" dur="6.36">funds are now heading out that are now</text>
  <text start="522.709" dur="6.12">going in this is not a good sign at all</text>
  <text start="526.399" dur="4.73">if we look at the most recent data from</text>
  <text start="528.829" dur="5.19">the investment company institute</text>
  <text start="531.129" dur="4.601">Americans contributed a total of three</text>
  <text start="534.019" dur="3.781">hundred and seventy three point six</text>
  <text start="535.73" dur="5.219">billion into the private sector DC plans</text>
  <text start="537.8" dur="6.479">in 2014 versus total benefits paid out</text>
  <text start="540.949" dur="6.33">of four hundred and 2.3 billion which</text>
  <text start="544.279" dur="7.321">means net contributions were negative</text>
  <text start="547.279" dur="7.29">twenty eight point seven billion so why</text>
  <text start="551.6" dur="5.429">is the US retirement market in big</text>
  <text start="554.569" dur="4.77">trouble well if you really look at it</text>
  <text start="557.029" dur="4.891">it&amp;#39;s completely obvious the u.s.</text>
  <text start="559.339" dur="5.34">retirement market well it is increased</text>
  <text start="561.92" dur="5.94">right along with the surge in total US</text>
  <text start="564.679" dur="6.931">public debt us retirement market value</text>
  <text start="567.86" dur="6.829">is being propped up by debt as the u.s.</text>
  <text start="571.61" dur="6.39">debt exploded from eight 875 billion in</text>
  <text start="574.689" dur="6.171">1982 twenty trillion currently the u.s.</text>
  <text start="578" dur="5.02">retirement market surged from 822</text>
  <text start="580.86" dur="4.77">billion to 25 point three trillion</text>
  <text start="583.02" dur="5.58">during the same exact time period we</text>
  <text start="585.63" dur="5.16">must we we need to remember this we mean</text>
  <text start="588.6" dur="6.74">we need to understand this that debt is</text>
  <text start="590.79" dur="7.86">not an asset also the true value is</text>
  <text start="595.34" dur="6.28">subtracting total debt from total assets</text>
  <text start="598.65" dur="5.67">now the reason the US market is a huge</text>
  <text start="601.62" dur="5.82">Ponzi scheme is that it has a stored</text>
  <text start="604.32" dur="6.15">digital i/o you rather than real</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="6.36">physical wealth a typical stock price is</text>
  <text start="610.47" dur="4.71">based on net present value they take the</text>
  <text start="613.8" dur="3.98">future value of the company&amp;#39;s earnings</text>
  <text start="615.18" dur="5.76">and give it a price today unfortunately</text>
  <text start="617.78" dur="6.43">company&amp;#39;s earnings are based on the</text>
  <text start="620.94" dur="5.73">burning energy in the future and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="624.21" dur="4.8">where the problem is back in the 30s</text>
  <text start="626.67" dur="4.11">these stock prices were based on book</text>
  <text start="629.01" dur="3.81">value basically what the value of the</text>
  <text start="630.78" dur="4.95">company was worth if all the assets were</text>
  <text start="632.82" dur="5.82">sold today well stock price is based on</text>
  <text start="635.73" dur="5.1">earnings earnings can and will implode</text>
  <text start="638.64" dur="4.89">when the markets crack due to massive</text>
  <text start="640.83" dur="4.98">debt and falling falling oil production</text>
  <text start="643.53" dur="3.54">and this is going to be a huge problem</text>
  <text start="645.81" dur="3.18">now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the pension</text>
  <text start="647.07" dur="3.9">problem and it is getting worse it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="4.44">terrible around the country it is a</text>
  <text start="650.97" dur="4.5">gigantic Ponzi scheme and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="653.43" dur="5.67">be a very big problem when everything</text>
  <text start="655.47" dur="6.72">comes crashing down now we see that the</text>
  <text start="659.1" dur="5.73">russian central bank well it opened its</text>
  <text start="662.19" dur="5.82">first overseas office in beijing on</text>

  <text start="803.08" dur="5.34">was you know a couple years ago and</text>
  <text start="805" dur="5.58">again this doesn&amp;#39;t happen overnight they</text>
  <text start="808.42" dur="4.08">look at the situation they see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="810.58" dur="4.41">going on they have to ramp up the gold</text>
  <text start="812.5" dur="4.62">over time they have to create these</text>
  <text start="814.99" dur="5.25">systems they have to separate themselves</text>
  <text start="817.12" dur="4.89">and I remember going back in time when</text>
  <text start="820.24" dur="3.24">people would you know right inside this</text>
  <text start="822.01" dur="3.39">is never going to happen they&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="823.48" dur="2.94">going to separate themselves well it</text>
  <text start="825.4" dur="3">looks like they&amp;#39;re prepared to do so</text>
  <text start="826.42" dur="5.49">China is never going to be led into the</text>
  <text start="828.4" dur="5.37">basket of SDRs which it was and we could</text>
  <text start="831.91" dur="3.66">see at this point that everything that</text>
  <text start="833.77" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;ve talked about years ago is now</text>
  <text start="835.57" dur="4.29">coming true today and when we look at</text>
  <text start="838.36" dur="3.66">the entire situation when we step back</text>
  <text start="839.86" dur="4.2">and we really take a look we can see we</text>
  <text start="842.02" dur="3.78">can definitely see what has been</text>
  <text start="844.06" dur="3.6">happening now it&amp;#39;s much easier to look</text>
  <text start="845.8" dur="2.43">at everything after the fact and say oh</text>
  <text start="847.66" dur="2.49">yeah</text>
  <text start="848.23" dur="4.23">I see they created their own Swift</text>
  <text start="850.15" dur="4.62">system I can see they started their own</text>
  <text start="852.46" dur="5.34">gold exchange yes I can see now they</text>
  <text start="854.77" dur="5.67">added to the basket of sdrs i can see</text>
  <text start="857.8" dur="4.62">that china and russia have been trading</text>
  <text start="860.44" dur="4.44">not using the dollar yes it&amp;#39;s very easy</text>
  <text start="862.42" dur="4.44">to go back in time to see all the stuff</text>
  <text start="864.88" dur="5.43">but what we have been doing is we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="866.86" dur="6.03">been reporting all of this as it happens</text>
