  <text start="168.87" dur="5.47">suggesting that the dollar index itself</text>
  <text start="170.89" dur="6.9">is the new fear indicator and we can see</text>
  <text start="174.34" dur="6.06">right now that this system right now is</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="4.44">built on a giant gigantic illusion if we</text>
  <text start="180.4" dur="4.32">go back to 2008 prior to two</text>
  <text start="182.23" dur="5.97">Nate and we look at what happened there</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="6.06">they kept the illusion alive and if you</text>
  <text start="188.2" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t believe that was an illusion think</text>
  <text start="190.78" dur="5.879">about this for a second the subprime</text>
  <text start="192.73" dur="6.3">securities they were built on a system</text>
  <text start="196.659" dur="4.741">where they took loans and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="4.41">care if it was loans that were bad loans</text>
  <text start="201.4" dur="5.28">that were good people were defaulting on</text>

  <text start="210.16" dur="8.07">all of this didn&amp;#39;t say a word and during</text>
  <text start="214.84" dur="5.31">this time not just a month or two they</text>
  <text start="218.23" dur="4.14">continually kept this illusion alive</text>
  <text start="220.15" dur="4.14">there were a few individuals that were</text>
  <text start="222.37" dur="5.19">out there saying these are junk no one</text>
  <text start="224.29" dur="5.19">would listen and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="3.899">now is if we look at the indicators</text>
  <text start="229.48" dur="4.589">leading up to the point where it crashed</text>
  <text start="231.459" dur="4.831">in 2008 we are seeing something very</text>
  <text start="234.069" dur="4.351">very similar and in some respects the</text>
  <text start="236.29" dur="6.509">indicators are even worse than they were</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="6.569">in 2008 right now Russia they are buying</text>
  <text start="242.799" dur="5.071">gold they have accelerated their goal</text>
  <text start="244.989" dur="5.011">process their gold purchasing in October</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="4.589">and we can see right now they have</text>
  <text start="250" dur="4.62">purchased 48 metric tons or 1.3 million</text>
  <text start="252.459" dur="4.261">ounces of gold bullion this is the</text>
  <text start="254.62" dur="4.89">largest edition of gold to the Russian</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="6.96">monetary reserves since 1998 and could</text>
  <text start="259.51" dur="7.5">be seen as a parting gift by Putin to</text>
  <text start="263.68" dur="6.57">Obama saying listen we know that this</text>
  <text start="267.01" dur="6.06">system is coming down we are protecting</text>
  <text start="270.25" dur="4.94">ourselves we are buying gold China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="4.29">buying gold and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="275.19" dur="4.78">central banks a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="277.36" dur="5.1">starting to purchase cold and dumping</text>
  <text start="279.97" dur="5.22">their Treasuries getting rid of their</text>
  <text start="282.46" dur="7.05">reserves using what they have right now</text>
  <text start="285.19" dur="9.09">to purchase more gold we see Obama as</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="6.6">he&amp;#39;s leaving the White House well we</text>
  <text start="294.28" dur="5.19">know that he uses a lot of executive</text>
  <text start="296.11" dur="7.32">orders and we can see that he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="299.47" dur="5.729">to keep his executive order or many</text>
  <text start="303.43" dur="4.859">people say it&amp;#39;s a murmur a memorandum</text>
  <text start="305.199" dur="5.131">that he used to create the illegal</text>
  <text start="308.289" dur="4.56">immigrants where he allowed them to come</text>
  <text start="310.33" dur="5.44">to the country and the Border Patrol DHS</text>
  <text start="312.849" dur="4.451">and everyone else can&amp;#39;t touch them</text>
  <text start="315.77" dur="3.48">and through executive orders and</text>
  <text start="317.3" dur="4.5">memorandums we can see the Justice</text>
  <text start="319.25" dur="5.12">Department is trying to back this up and</text>
  <text start="321.8" dur="5.03">they&amp;#39;re attempting to force</text>
  <text start="324.37" dur="5.949">organizations around the country to hire</text>
  <text start="326.83" dur="6.01">illegal immigrants for instance the</text>
  <text start="330.319" dur="4.171">Denver County Sheriff office has been</text>
  <text start="332.84" dur="3.77">slapped with a fine by the department of</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="5.13">justice because refused to hire</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="6.13">non-citizens as deputies from the</text>
  <text start="339.62" dur="5.22">beginning of 2015 through the last March</text>
  <text start="342.74" dur="5.73">determine the Denver sheriff department</text>
  <text start="344.84" dur="6.21">went on a major hiring binge adding more</text>
  <text start="348.47" dur="5.009">than 200 new deputies but those jobs</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="5.16">ended up only going to citizens because</text>
  <text start="353.479" dur="5.31">that the Parma made citizenship a stated</text>
  <text start="356.21" dur="3.75">requirement on the job application now</text>
  <text start="358.789" dur="2.85">the department they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="359.96" dur="3.72">go through all their job applications</text>
  <text start="361.639" dur="4.231">for the past three years identifying</text>
  <text start="363.68" dur="5.31">immigrants who were excluded from the</text>
  <text start="365.87" dur="5.34">hiring process and now giving them due</text>
  <text start="368.99" dur="5.04">consideration because the US government</text>
  <text start="371.21" dur="6.269">placed a fine on the sheriff department</text>
  <text start="374.03" dur="6.3">but they&amp;#39;re saying how can we hire these</text>
  <text start="377.479" dur="5.701">individuals to enforce the law when they</text>
  <text start="380.33" dur="8.579">violated the law they&amp;#39;re here illegally</text>
  <text start="383.18" dur="10.829">and they&amp;#39;re not citizens but we can see</text>
  <text start="388.909" dur="7.801">right now that Obama&amp;#39;s plan the global</text>
  <text start="394.009" dur="5.25">elite the shadow government the central</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="4.41">banks they want the illegals in this</text>
  <text start="399.259" dur="5.371">country and it&amp;#39;s done for many different</text>
  <text start="401.12" dur="6.329">reasons one they can bypass the</text>
  <text start="404.63" dur="4.95">penalties by hiring these individuals</text>
  <text start="407.449" dur="4.641">and corporations where the companies do</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="6.42">not have to pay penalties on Obamacare</text>
  <text start="412.09" dur="5.59">to we understand that the way of life</text>
  <text start="416" dur="4.199">here in the United States is about the</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="4.62">change and we&amp;#39;re going to becoming a</text>
  <text start="420.199" dur="4.351">third world country once the dollar dies</text>
  <text start="422.3" dur="4.169">bringing more of these individuals in</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="4.549">they&amp;#39;ll be able to pay them a lot less</text>
  <text start="426.469" dur="5.341">money they&amp;#39;ll be able to do the work</text>
  <text start="429.099" dur="5.111">three they use them to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="431.81" dur="5.609">voting the more illegals they have in</text>
  <text start="434.21" dur="5.549">here they&amp;#39;re not tracked nobody knows</text>
  <text start="437.419" dur="4.411">really where they are except for the US</text>
  <text start="439.759" dur="3.541">government we have some idea but they</text>
  <text start="441.83" dur="5.459">can be placed in two different cities</text>
  <text start="443.3" dur="6">and strategically used to boost the</text>
  <text start="447.289" dur="4.681">popular vote up and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="449.3" dur="4.709">seen that done so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="451.97" dur="4.319">there are many different agendas</text>
  <text start="454.009" dur="6.891">associated with bringing illegals into</text>
  <text start="456.289" dur="7.16">the country we can also see right now as</text>
  <text start="460.9" dur="5.38">this whole thing starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="463.449" dur="5.891">we&amp;#39;re going to see the government</text>
  <text start="466.28" dur="6.9">continually try to push laws that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="469.34" dur="5.88">in line with the Constitution now we</text>
  <text start="473.18" dur="4.68">know that Trump now is moving into the</text>
  <text start="475.22" dur="5.699">presidency but we will have to see what</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="6.809">actions he takes and what he actually</text>
  <text start="480.919" dur="7.47">does while in office we see the Navy</text>

  <text start="488.389" dur="5.071">warship well it broke down once again</text>
  <text start="491.12" dur="4.199">and we can see right now the ship had to</text>
  <text start="493.46" dur="4.829">be towed to appear by the Panama Canal</text>
  <text start="495.319" dur="5.581">Authority and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="498.289" dur="5.13">details of a cause the breakdown well</text>
  <text start="500.9" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re really not forthcoming at this</text>
  <text start="503.419" dur="4.411">point but we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="505.31" dur="4.02">ship&amp;#39;s integrated power plant well it</text>
  <text start="507.83" dur="4.079">might have contributed to the mishap</text>
  <text start="509.33" dur="6.66">where the ship had to be towed away the</text>
  <text start="511.909" dur="7.081">ship also broke down months ago and they</text>

  <text start="727.05" dur="6.6">them back into his country and said</text>
  <text start="730.71" dur="7.74">Syria was attacking him because he wants</text>
  <text start="733.65" dur="7.62">to implement article 5 of NATO which</text>
  <text start="738.45" dur="5.85">allows NATO to join into the fight and</text>
  <text start="741.27" dur="5.07">what he did at that point is that it was</text>
  <text start="744.3" dur="4.02">on youtube it was on Twitter that this</text>
  <text start="746.34" dur="3.96">was completely fake he tried to shut</text>
  <text start="748.32" dur="3.42">this down and block it well it looks</text>
  <text start="750.3" dur="4.02">like he&amp;#39;s trying to do the same thing</text>
  <text start="751.74" dur="7.35">once again he&amp;#39;s trying to bring NATO</text>
  <text start="754.32" dur="7.05">into the fight he&amp;#39;s using this to start</text>
  <text start="759.09" dur="5.37">a war because we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="761.37" dur="5.31">shadow government the central bankers</text>
  <text start="764.46" dur="3.99">the elite they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="766.68" dur="4.29">now the Syrian Armed Forces they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="768.45" dur="5.01">there saying absolutely not our fighters</text>
  <text start="770.97" dur="5.52">were not in the area whatsoever we did</text>
  <text start="773.46" dur="6.62">not bomb this area so right now turkey</text>
  <text start="776.49" dur="5.94">is on high alert their f-16 warplanes</text>
  <text start="780.08" dur="5.11">warplanes were put on emergency standby</text>
  <text start="782.43" dur="4.77">and we can see that turkey has done this</text>
  <text start="785.19" dur="5.25">before not just with sending soldiers</text>
  <text start="787.2" dur="6.24">into Turkey but the time when turkey</text>
  <text start="790.44" dur="4.74">actually shot down a Russian jet where</text>
  <text start="793.44" dur="4.47">they said Oh turkey was I mean our</text>
  <text start="795.18" dur="5.91">Russia was flying over the border into</text>
  <text start="797.91" dur="6.3">Turkey and we shot them down and we know</text>
  <text start="801.09" dur="6.3">for a fact that the Russian bombers had</text>
  <text start="804.21" dur="5.16">no missile systems on there that they</text>
  <text start="807.39" dur="4.29">could fire at other planes they only had</text>
  <text start="809.37" dur="4.29">bombs that they can drop and hit targets</text>
  <text start="811.68" dur="4.77">on the ground and then we come to find</text>
  <text start="813.66" dur="5.88">out that the Russian jet was never even</text>
  <text start="816.45" dur="6.54">in Turkish airspace now remember turkey</text>
  <text start="819.54" dur="6.39">flies their military jets and violates</text>
  <text start="822.99" dur="4.38">Greece&amp;#39;s airspace many many times but</text>
  <text start="825.93" dur="3.72">Greece has never shot their planes down</text>
  <text start="827.37" dur="3.87">they could have radioed them they could</text>
  <text start="829.65" dur="5.6">have done a lot of things but we can see</text>
  <text start="831.24" dur="8.37">what her one the global elite the shadow</text>
  <text start="835.25" dur="7.74">government the central bankers they want</text>
  <text start="839.61" dur="7.35">a war and we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="842.99" dur="6.45">escalate probably from now until Trump</text>
  <text start="846.96" dur="3.689">is inaugurated and even at that point</text>
  <text start="849.44" dur="4.059">there go</text>
  <text start="850.649" dur="4.8">to try to trap them into getting a war</text>
  <text start="853.499" dur="4.221">because what we&amp;#39;re having right now and</text>
  <text start="855.449" dur="5.19">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the economy</text>
  <text start="857.72" dur="5.859">well it is deteriorating it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="860.639" dur="5.13">down we can see right now that they need</text>
  <text start="863.579" dur="4.141">this war they&amp;#39;d like to reduce the</text>
  <text start="865.769" dur="3.48">population they like to cover up the</text>
  <text start="867.72" dur="4.649">economic collapse they want to blame a</text>
  <text start="869.249" dur="4.68">country because in the end what they</text>
  <text start="872.369" dur="3.96">want to do is they want to restart this</text>
  <text start="873.929" dur="4.44">entire system and hopefully with through</text>
  <text start="876.329" dur="4.471">the war and everything that goes on that</text>
  <text start="878.369" dur="5.13">everyone forgets what has happened prior</text>
  <text start="880.8" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s what they like to do and this way</text>
  <text start="883.499" dur="3.63">they can just restart their system they</text>
  <text start="885.3" dur="4.68">can create a new currency they can</text>
  <text start="887.129" dur="5.7">continually control the people and many</text>
  <text start="889.98" dur="4.409">people don&amp;#39;t remember what happened and</text>
  <text start="892.829" dur="7.5">and this is what they&amp;#39;re betting on</text>
  <text start="894.389" dur="9">right now so what is coming in probably</text>
  <text start="900.329" dur="5.79">the very near future is that the economy</text>
  <text start="903.389" dur="4.32">is going to collapse most likely they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="906.119" dur="4.56">going to try to push war as hard as they</text>
  <text start="907.709" dur="4.98">possibly can and during this period of</text>
  <text start="910.679" dur="5.91">time you need to be prepared you need to</text>
  <text start="912.689" dur="7.231">purchase gold and silver protect your</text>
  <text start="916.589" dur="5.73">wealth you need to have cash on hand to</text>
  <text start="919.92" dur="5.25">use that during the crisis when the</text>
  <text start="922.319" dur="5.841">economy starts falling and and crumbling</text>
  <text start="925.17" dur="4.95">apart you need to have food and water</text>
  <text start="928.16" dur="8.169">you need to have a weapon to protect</text>
  <text start="930.12" dur="10.259">yourself you need a plan to move if you</text>
  <text start="936.329" dur="7.911">need to move out of the area and we can</text>
  <text start="940.379" dur="6.63">see at this point that with the Fed</text>
  <text start="944.24" dur="4.48">raising interest rates in December which</text>
  <text start="947.009" dur="3.06">I do believe they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="948.72" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re going to do and most likely</text>
  <text start="950.069" dur="4.351">going to do this is a signal that</text>
  <text start="952.11" dur="4.709">they&amp;#39;re preparing to bring down the</text>
  <text start="954.42" dur="5.37">entire economy because think about</text>
  <text start="956.819" dur="6.661">Europe is a negative interest rates Bank</text>
  <text start="959.79" dur="5.339">of a bank of japan and japan is keeping</text>

  <text start="968.459" dur="6.57">going to be raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="970.559" dur="7.921">and think about the debt think about the</text>
  <text start="975.029" dur="5.43">global debt think about the dollar think</text>
  <text start="978.48" dur="3.599">about what the central banks around the</text>

  <text start="982.079" dur="3.231">world</text>
  <text start="983.18" dur="4.95">this whole thing cannot be sustained</text>
