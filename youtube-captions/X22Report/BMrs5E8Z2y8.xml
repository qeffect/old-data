  <text start="62.14" dur="5.88">government accountable for its actions</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="6.13">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="68.02" dur="7.099">political energy of political news now</text>
  <text start="71.17" dur="6.449">as these elections move forward and</text>
  <text start="75.119" dur="3.64">depending on who is voted in it really</text>
  <text start="77.619" dur="5.28">doesn&amp;#39;t matter because we have to</text>
  <text start="78.759" dur="6.601">remember the individuals who are</text>
  <text start="82.899" dur="4.951">controlling the country they are the</text>
  <text start="85.36" dur="5.06">shadow government they are the people</text>
  <text start="87.85" dur="4.95">behind the curtain there are the</text>
  <text start="90.42" dur="5.259">non-elected individuals that are</text>
  <text start="92.8" dur="4.65">actually running the entire system it is</text>
  <text start="95.679" dur="5.241">not the president the president is a</text>

  <text start="103.81" dur="5.94">what do they do they get rid of that</text>
  <text start="105.549" dur="8.481">person and what we need to do is we need</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="6.24">to hold the government accountable</text>
  <text start="114.03" dur="6.729">coming from the Rutherford Institute</text>
  <text start="115.99" dur="7.64">John Whitehead he lays out the</text>
  <text start="120.759" dur="5.4">principles for a free government and</text>
  <text start="123.63" dur="5.62">when we look at it we can see that</text>
  <text start="126.159" dur="5.191">history teaches us if the people have</text>
  <text start="129.25" dur="4.92">little or no knowledge of the basics of</text>
  <text start="131.35" dur="6.57">government and their rights those who</text>
  <text start="134.17" dur="7.71">wield government power inevitably wield</text>
  <text start="137.92" dur="6.03">it excessively after all the citizenry</text>
  <text start="141.88" dur="3.72">can only hold its government accountable</text>
  <text start="143.95" dur="7.8">if it knows when the government</text>
  <text start="145.6" dur="9.509">oversteps its bounds now Americans are</text>
  <text start="151.75" dur="6.06">very easily distracted because as study</text>
  <text start="155.109" dur="5.371">after study shows they they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="157.81" dur="4.73">know their rights because their elected</text>
  <text start="160.48" dur="4.17">officials no longer represent them</text>
  <text start="162.54" dur="3.97">Americans have been brainwashing to</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="5.73">believe in that their only duty as a</text>
  <text start="166.51" dur="5.43">citizen is to vote the citizenry has</text>
  <text start="170.38" dur="4.05">failed to hold government officials</text>
  <text start="171.94" dur="6.66">accountable to abiding by the</text>
  <text start="174.43" dur="6.209">Constitution and the American</text>
  <text start="178.6" dur="3.33">governmental scheme is sliding ever</text>
  <text start="180.639" dur="5.341">closer towards a</text>
  <text start="181.93" dur="5.699">pervasive authoritarianism big</text>
  <text start="185.98" dur="3.509">government has grown bigger and the</text>
  <text start="187.629" dur="5.34">rights of the citizenry has grown</text>
  <text start="189.489" dur="4.89">smaller the following principles well</text>
  <text start="192.969" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re a good starting point to</text>
  <text start="194.379" dur="5.551">understand what a free government is and</text>
  <text start="197.079" dur="7.47">we know that power corrupts well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.93" dur="7.229">an absolute the drafters of the</text>
  <text start="204.549" dur="6.42">Constitution the Bill of Rights well</text>
  <text start="207.159" dur="6.271">they knew one thing distrust all of</text>
  <text start="210.969" dur="4.621">those who hold government power James</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="4.35">Madison said and he&amp;#39;s the author of the</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="4.679">bill of rights all men having power</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="7.879">ought to be distrusted to a certain</text>
  <text start="220.269" dur="8.97">degree and what we see right now is that</text>
  <text start="225.659" dur="5.95">we need to control the government we</text>
  <text start="229.239" dur="6.301">need to hold them accountable for their</text>
  <text start="231.609" dur="5.731">actions and the purpose of the</text>
  <text start="235.54" dur="5.16">Constitution the Bill of Rights and the</text>
  <text start="237.34" dur="6.239">way they set everything up is to limit</text>
  <text start="240.7" dur="4.92">governmental power and to ensure that</text>
  <text start="243.579" dur="4.44">the government performs its bakes basic</text>
  <text start="245.62" dur="8.449">function to preserve and protect our</text>
  <text start="248.019" dur="10.59">rights of We the People we can also see</text>
  <text start="254.069" dur="8.651">that no one is above the law not even</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="6.331">those who make the law if all people</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="3.96">possess equal rights the people who live</text>
  <text start="264.94" dur="5.34">under the laws must be allowed to</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="5.85">participate in making those laws by that</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="5.16">same token those who make the laws must</text>
  <text start="272.53" dur="5.609">live under the laws they make however as</text>
  <text start="275.44" dur="5.19">we can see today those government</text>
  <text start="278.139" dur="5.161">officials they believe they&amp;#39;re above the</text>
  <text start="280.63" dur="7.86">laws they make one set of laws for us</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="7.35">they have no set of laws and they</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="4.26">believe that they&amp;#39;re royalty they</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="3.9">believe that they should be getting all</text>
  <text start="292.75" dur="3.21">these perks that they should have the</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="3.03">best pension plan they should have the</text>
  <text start="295.96" dur="3.63">best health insurance plan they have</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="3.24">should have golf courses restaurants</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="4.23">they should be driven around in</text>
  <text start="300.82" dur="7.439">limousines they should be taking to</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="6.3">place to place on private jets and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="308.259" dur="5.851">seen this before if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="310.12" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s called royalty and these people are</text>
  <text start="314.11" dur="4.95">not royalty</text>
  <text start="315.46" dur="10.62">these are the servants of the American</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="9.449">person and those who created the</text>
  <text start="326.08" dur="5.28">Constitution the Bill of Rights they</text>
  <text start="328.509" dur="4.741">wanted a separation of power they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="331.36" dur="3.779">want a single authority to be entrusted</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="4.349">with all powers of the government this</text>
  <text start="335.139" dur="4.351">is why they divided the government to</text>
  <text start="337.599" dur="5.431">three co-equal branches legislative</text>
  <text start="339.49" dur="7.7">executive and judicial and we can see</text>
  <text start="343.03" dur="7.56">right now is they did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="347.19" dur="7.659">they didn&amp;#39;t realize that the executive</text>
  <text start="350.59" dur="6.81">branch would draw power by aligning</text>
  <text start="354.849" dur="3.961">themselves with corporations aligning</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="3.6">themselves with the central bank</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="5.16">aligning themselves by creating</text>
  <text start="361" dur="6.87">executive orders and memorandums where</text>
  <text start="363.97" dur="5.22">they dictate certain things and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="3.51">very interesting is that the framers</text>
  <text start="369.19" dur="7.039">fear that Congress would abuse its</text>
  <text start="371.38" dur="10.379">powers because they had the ability to</text>
  <text start="376.229" dur="8.881">tax people now Congress they are</text>
  <text start="381.759" dur="6.72">influenced by foreign governments</text>
  <text start="385.11" dur="6.01">corporations lobbyists by giving them</text>
  <text start="388.479" dur="5.101">money to do certain things so we see a</text>
  <text start="391.12" dur="6.45">corruption in the executive and we see a</text>
  <text start="393.58" dur="7.139">corruption in Congress and really what</text>
  <text start="397.57" dur="5.43">we need to do is get rid of all of this</text>
  <text start="400.719" dur="5.04">where people can or are such as a</text>
  <text start="403" dur="6.15">corporation&amp;#39;s foreign governments</text>
  <text start="405.759" dur="6.69">central banks they should not have the</text>
  <text start="409.15" dur="5.43">right to give government officials any</text>
  <text start="412.449" dur="6.301">type of money it&amp;#39;s almost like working</text>
  <text start="414.58" dur="8.369">in a financial institution with the SEC</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="7.409">where you can&amp;#39;t accept certain funds for</text>
  <text start="422.949" dur="4.681">dune certain certain things well with</text>
  <text start="426.159" dur="4.531">the government powers they should</text>
  <text start="427.63" dur="6.69">receive absolutely no money from any</text>
  <text start="430.69" dur="7.92">group any corporation or anything like</text>
  <text start="434.32" dur="10.25">that because it&amp;#39;s easy to bribe the</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="5.96">officials and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="445.38" dur="3.759">the people are supposed to have a voice</text>
  <text start="447.969" dur="4.47">by sending their</text>
  <text start="449.139" dur="5.37">government and elected a representative</text>
  <text start="452.439" dur="5.04">to do their bidding but today we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="454.509" dur="6.96">have that because most of Congress the</text>
  <text start="457.479" dur="7.861">president well they don&amp;#39;t work for the</text>
  <text start="461.469" dur="5.94">people anymore and the people well</text>
  <text start="465.34" dur="4.979">they&amp;#39;re to blame too the people have</text>
  <text start="467.409" dur="3.991">gotten lazy they believe the government</text>
  <text start="470.319" dur="3.361">is doing everything in their best</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="4.62">interests they haven&amp;#39;t been checking up</text>
  <text start="473.68" dur="5.22">on the government they&amp;#39;re believing the</text>
  <text start="476.02" dur="4.35">corporate media whatever they say that</text>
  <text start="478.9" dur="4.199">must be the truth the corporate media</text>
  <text start="480.37" dur="5.639">has been bought out by corporations by</text>
  <text start="483.099" dur="4.62">the government and they don&amp;#39;t do any</text>
  <text start="486.009" dur="3.601">type of investigating reporting they</text>
  <text start="487.719" dur="4.111">don&amp;#39;t hell they don&amp;#39;t hold the</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="4.109">government accountable anymore the</text>
  <text start="491.83" dur="4.679">people do not hold the government</text>
  <text start="493.719" dur="8.22">accountable anymore I mean think about</text>
  <text start="496.509" dur="9.241">this for a second we had the person who</text>
  <text start="501.939" dur="9.81">was heading up the NSA lie to Congress</text>
  <text start="505.75" dur="8.339">when asked if he was spying on the</text>
  <text start="511.749" dur="4.29">American people he said no we are not</text>
  <text start="514.089" dur="5.851">and then we come to find out that yes he</text>
  <text start="516.039" dur="6.5">was and the people should have been in</text>
  <text start="519.94" dur="4.889">an uproar demanding his resignation</text>
  <text start="522.539" dur="5.021">demanding a complete overhaul and</text>
  <text start="524.829" dur="7.861">getting most of the individuals out of</text>
  <text start="527.56" dur="7.58">power but instead the people did pretty</text>
  <text start="532.69" dur="4.259">much nothing because the corporate media</text>
  <text start="535.14" dur="3.79">reported it in a completely different</text>
  <text start="536.949" dur="3.63">way Obama came out and said there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.93" dur="4.56">going to be incredible reforms and</text>
  <text start="540.579" dur="4.44">everyone just believed that and nobody</text>
  <text start="543.49" dur="3.3">really checked up on it and what we</text>
  <text start="545.019" dur="4.081">really saw was they did absolutely</text>
  <text start="546.79" dur="3.6">nothing where they didn&amp;#39;t reform</text>
  <text start="549.1" dur="3.179">anything they actually made it worse</text>
  <text start="550.39" dur="4.58">actually they&amp;#39;re spying on the more on</text>
  <text start="552.279" dur="5.881">people even more than they did before</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="5.619">through a different method and this is</text>
  <text start="558.16" dur="6.09">what we need to do we need to hold the</text>
  <text start="560.589" dur="6.81">government accountable and we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="7.8">in to a completely new administration</text>
  <text start="567.399" dur="8.041">and the shadow government is still there</text>
  <text start="572.05" dur="6.18">the central bank is still there this is</text>
  <text start="575.44" dur="6.69">where the people need to come together</text>
  <text start="578.23" dur="5.97">and say you know something</text>
  <text start="582.13" dur="5.48">we need to clean house forget these</text>
  <text start="584.2" dur="7.56">elections this whole thing was a force</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="6.88">we need to go deep inside to see who</text>
  <text start="591.76" dur="6.96">these individuals are what they are</text>
  <text start="594.49" dur="6.45">doing there and dismantle most of what</text>
  <text start="598.72" dur="4.77">we have right now and change the rules</text>
  <text start="600.94" dur="5.79">and the laws for our government</text>
  <text start="603.49" dur="6.2">officials where they cannot accept money</text>
  <text start="606.73" dur="7.26">from corporations for their campaigns</text>
  <text start="609.69" dur="7.6">they can&amp;#39;t accept money from central</text>
  <text start="613.99" dur="7.74">bank&amp;#39;s foreign governments there now</text>
  <text start="617.29" dur="7.77">I&amp;#39;ll accept money period that&amp;#39;s it the</text>
  <text start="621.73" dur="6.81">only pay they get is what the government</text>
  <text start="625.06" dur="6.11">gives for that job and their number one</text>
  <text start="628.54" dur="5.43">interest is to work for the people</text>
  <text start="631.17" dur="5.41">there&amp;#39;s no favours to lobbyists as</text>
  <text start="633.97" dur="6.51">nothing like this and we need to change</text>
  <text start="636.58" dur="7.71">how they submit bills one bill one issue</text>
  <text start="640.48" dur="6.39">no riders nothing attached nothing like</text>
  <text start="644.29" dur="6.75">that there are certain things we need to</text>
  <text start="646.87" dur="8.46">change and we need to do this to the</text>
  <text start="651.04" dur="6.87">executive branch where the executive</text>
  <text start="655.33" dur="6">orders the memorandums those need to be</text>
  <text start="657.91" dur="8.52">laid out completely different they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.33" dur="9.87">not Dick torial powers and we need these</text>
  <text start="666.43" dur="7.8">agencies the CIA the NSA the FBI they</text>
  <text start="671.2" dur="6.15">need to be dismantled because they have</text>
  <text start="674.23" dur="6.9">violated the rights of the people and</text>
  <text start="677.35" dur="8.37">the people need to monitor these</text>
  <text start="681.13" dur="7.29">agencies I mean there&amp;#39;s a lot of work to</text>
  <text start="685.72" dur="5.1">be done here and the only way to do this</text>
  <text start="688.42" dur="5.13">is to hold the government accountable</text>
  <text start="690.82" dur="6.93">call them out on every single thing</text>
  <text start="693.55" dur="7.73">every single day because if we the</text>
  <text start="697.75" dur="7.2">people just sit back we the people</text>
  <text start="701.28" dur="6.67">they&amp;#39;re gonna remove the rights because</text>
  <text start="704.95" dur="4.35">no one will be looking just like they</text>
  <text start="707.95" dur="3.36">tax the people when they said they</text>
  <text start="709.3" dur="3.51">weren&amp;#39;t going to tax the people just</text>
  <text start="711.31" dur="3.36">like those holes told us that the</text>
  <text start="712.81" dur="3.29">Affordable Care Act was going to be</text>
  <text start="714.67" dur="3.18">affordable</text>
  <text start="716.1" dur="3.429">just like they said they were going to</text>
  <text start="717.85" dur="3.029">stop spying on the American people and</text>
  <text start="719.529" dur="3.24">they increase the spying on the American</text>
  <text start="720.879" dur="4.861">people just like they said there&amp;#39;s going</text>

  <text start="729.959" dur="5.471">everything they&amp;#39;ve told us has been one</text>
  <text start="733.48" dur="7.68">gigantic light and it&amp;#39;s time for us to</text>
  <text start="735.43" dur="9.449">take back this country now out in</text>
  <text start="741.16" dur="6.479">Ukraine we see that the United States is</text>
  <text start="744.879" dur="4.44">pointing their fingers at Russia saying</text>
  <text start="747.639" dur="4.26">that they&amp;#39;re responsible for everything</text>
  <text start="749.319" dur="5.401">that&amp;#39;s been going on there and Moscow</text>
  <text start="751.899" dur="5.49">right now is rejecting accusations that</text>
  <text start="754.72" dur="5.07">they are holding back the peace process</text>
  <text start="757.389" dur="3.69">in Ukraine we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="759.79" dur="3.33">what the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="761.079" dur="3.271">do right before they have a major</text>
  <text start="763.12" dur="4.019">offensive they start pointing fingers</text>
  <text start="764.35" dur="5.339">they start saying this is this is where</text>
  <text start="767.139" dur="3.661">the problem originates and we can see</text>
  <text start="769.689" dur="6.301">right now they&amp;#39;ve been planning this for</text>

  <text start="877.329" dur="3.481">can&amp;#39;t see it they&amp;#39;re not going to have</text>
  <text start="879.279" dur="3.571">people there are switching votes maybe</text>
  <text start="880.81" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re doing it because some people</text>

  <text start="891.76" dur="4.439">is where they can really make a</text>
  <text start="892.959" dur="5.07">difference behind the scenes and we</text>
  <text start="896.199" dur="4.231">talked about fraction magic we talked</text>
  <text start="898.029" dur="5.161">about reprogramming the system from the</text>
  <text start="900.43" dur="5.55">top and this way nobody knows what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="903.19" dur="5.31">really going on we see Russia&amp;#39;s Admiral</text>

  <text start="912.88" dur="3.389">Mediterranean and it looks like right</text>
  <text start="915.1" dur="3.15">now they&amp;#39;re going to be starting their</text>
  <text start="916.269" dur="5.671">bombing of Aleppo they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="918.25" dur="5.069">bombing the outskirts of Aleppo they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="921.94" dur="3.72">going to be using the caliber cruise</text>
  <text start="923.319" dur="5.101">missiles most likely it&amp;#39;ll be launched</text>
  <text start="925.66" dur="5.52">from submarines and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="928.42" dur="4.68">that they&amp;#39;re going to be hitting Aleppo</text>
  <text start="931.18" dur="3.839">very hard and United States government</text>
  <text start="933.1" dur="4.71">central bankers they understand this</text>
  <text start="935.019" dur="5.101">they realize this we see the terrorists</text>
  <text start="937.81" dur="3.66">in Syria which is controlled by the</text>
  <text start="940.12" dur="3.329">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="941.47" dur="3.69">and the coalition forces they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="943.449" dur="4.291">using chlorine gas and the Aleppo</text>
  <text start="945.16" dur="6.39">offensive reports are coming in that the</text>
  <text start="947.74" dur="6.8">terrorists are using makeshift type of</text>
  <text start="951.55" dur="6.51">bombs they fill in with chlorine gas and</text>
  <text start="954.54" dur="6.45">they launch them and they hit the Syrian</text>
  <text start="958.06" dur="7.62">government troops and they hit civilians</text>
  <text start="960.99" dur="9.82">but again they don&amp;#39;t care at all we see</text>
  <text start="965.68" dur="9.95">right now during the election day a town</text>
  <text start="970.81" dur="8.959">called Murmansk in Russia was hit by</text>
  <text start="975.63" dur="7.22">something the power station blew up</text>
  <text start="979.769" dur="5.69">300,000 people are so are left without</text>
  <text start="982.85" dur="4.26">city and we understand the United States</text>
  <text start="985.459" dur="3.781">government central bankers they breached</text>
  <text start="987.11" dur="4.469">Russia and they said they&amp;#39;re prepared</text>
  <text start="989.24" dur="7.649">and ready to use a cyber attack on</text>
  <text start="991.579" dur="8.101">Russia now did they do this to start the</text>
  <text start="996.889" dur="5.76">cyber war we have the elections going on</text>
  <text start="999.68" dur="4.98">we don&amp;#39;t know right now reports are</text>
  <text start="1002.649" dur="3.99">coming in that they&amp;#39;re investigating of</text>
  <text start="1004.66" dur="4.77">what happened but you can see the entire</text>
  <text start="1006.639" dur="6.151">area just all of a sudden got hit now</text>
  <text start="1009.43" dur="5.19">this is a very strange coincidence that</text>
  <text start="1012.79" dur="4.56">it just so happened on Election Day</text>
  <text start="1014.62" dur="4.35">november eighth and we know that the US</text>
  <text start="1017.35" dur="4.409">government central bankers have said</text>
  <text start="1018.97" dur="4.739">listen we are prepared and ready to</text>
  <text start="1021.759" dur="3.841">cyber attack Russia if they interfere</text>
  <text start="1023.709" dur="3.96">with the elections and like I said if</text>
  <text start="1025.6" dur="4.62">the elections are not going in the way</text>
  <text start="1027.669" dur="7.101">that they want they will use a cyber</text>
  <text start="1030.22" dur="8.31">attack now did they do this to prepare</text>
  <text start="1034.77" dur="6.85">for the next step we don&amp;#39;t know and</text>
  <text start="1038.53" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see we see that</text>
  <text start="1041.62" dur="5.25">the US military and intelligence experts</text>
  <text start="1043.72" dur="5.939">well they&amp;#39;re gearing up for some type of</text>
  <text start="1046.87" dur="5.7">cyber attacks they have all hands on</text>
  <text start="1049.659" dur="5.64">deck and they&amp;#39;re prepared and ready we</text>
  <text start="1052.57" dur="4.979">see NATO is out there saying that the</text>
  <text start="1055.299" dur="4.771">risk of election tampering is at</text>
  <text start="1057.549" dur="4.891">thirty-three percent and they are</text>
  <text start="1060.07" dur="5.13">warning Russia not to do anything that</text>
  <text start="1062.44" dur="4.05">would affect the voting and we can see</text>
  <text start="1065.2" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re continually pointing the fingers</text>
  <text start="1066.49" dur="3.929">at Russia because they want this</text>
  <text start="1068.71" dur="4.53">election to go their way they want it</text>
  <text start="1070.419" dur="4.561">very close but again if something should</text>
  <text start="1073.24" dur="5.16">happen where the popular vote pulls out</text>
  <text start="1074.98" dur="5.73">and it goes towards Trump this is where</text>
  <text start="1078.4" dur="7.769">the problem comes in in Ohio they have</text>
  <text start="1080.71" dur="7.86">the National Guard on standby and in</text>
  <text start="1086.169" dur="5.521">position to handle any type of</text>
  <text start="1088.57" dur="6.239">cybersecurity threat now what are they</text>
  <text start="1091.69" dur="4.41">going to do I don&amp;#39;t know and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1094.809" dur="4.801">interesting about all this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1096.1" dur="6.6">continually asking Trump and his party</text>
  <text start="1099.61" dur="4.88">will you concede if you lose the</text>
  <text start="1102.7" dur="4.68">elections they keep asking this question</text>
  <text start="1104.49" dur="4.96">do they know something we don&amp;#39;t that he</text>
  <text start="1107.38" dur="3.99">already lost because that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1109.45" dur="5.76">starting to sound like because it seems</text>
  <text start="1111.37" dur="5.82">that they don&amp;#39;t want him pointing the</text>
  <text start="1115.21" dur="3.96">finger at a rigged election</text>
  <text start="1117.19" dur="4.59">they don&amp;#39;t want him saying we&amp;#39;ll wait a</text>
  <text start="1119.17" dur="5.28">minute this is very strange because I</text>
  <text start="1121.78" dur="6.36">had individuals doing an exit poll these</text>
  <text start="1124.45" dur="5.31">do not match up or he was out ahead in</text>
  <text start="1128.14" dur="4.92">the popular vote and the electoral</text>
  <text start="1129.76" dur="6.74">college gave it to Hillary they want his</text>
  <text start="1133.06" dur="5.73">answer they want him on tape on video</text>
  <text start="1136.5" dur="4.15">this way they can go back and say you</text>
  <text start="1138.79" dur="5.64">said you were going to do this because</text>
  <text start="1140.65" dur="6.3">they don&amp;#39;t want his party looking for a</text>
  <text start="1144.43" dur="6.84">rigged election because again this is</text>
  <text start="1146.95" dur="5.67">not going to help the establishment this</text>
  <text start="1151.27" dur="3.54">is going to make it worse because they</text>
  <text start="1152.62" dur="6.24">don&amp;#39;t want people looking into how these</text>
  <text start="1154.81" dur="6.42">systems actually work and we see Angela</text>
  <text start="1158.86" dur="5.25">Merkel is out there saying that Russia</text>
  <text start="1161.23" dur="6.78">may interfere in Germans election next</text>
  <text start="1164.11" dur="6.29">year so it looks like the NATO countries</text>
  <text start="1168.01" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re all jumping on the bandwagon</text>
  <text start="1170.4" dur="4.09">that Russia is going to interfere with</text>
  <text start="1172.9" dur="3.87">elections because these individuals want</text>
  <text start="1174.49" dur="4.08">to keep their power they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1176.77" dur="5.79">give it up and they will do anything</text>
  <text start="1178.57" dur="6.42">they have to to keep their power so</text>
  <text start="1182.56" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re heading down a road where</text>
  <text start="1184.99" dur="6.36">everything is going to go completely</text>
  <text start="1187.39" dur="6.03">haywire after this election that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1191.35" dur="4.05">really matter who&amp;#39;s in office because</text>
  <text start="1193.42" dur="5.27">the shadow government runs everything</text>
  <text start="1195.4" dur="6.59">and their mission is still the same</text>
  <text start="1198.69" dur="6.31">collapse the economy get us into war</text>
  <text start="1201.99" dur="6.97">blame it on another country this was not</text>
