  <text start="90.08" dur="5.52">bank itself the deep state and those</text>
  <text start="93.17" dur="4.619">individuals that prosper from the</text>
  <text start="95.6" dur="5.22">central bank system and we know that the</text>
  <text start="97.789" dur="6">central bank they do not like any type</text>
  <text start="100.82" dur="5.88">of currency or monetary system that</text>
  <text start="103.789" dur="5.79">challenges theirs there is is the</text>
  <text start="106.7" dur="6.15">supreme currency system theirs is the</text>
  <text start="109.579" dur="6.991">only one they want out around the world</text>
  <text start="112.85" dur="6.03">anything else well it just won&amp;#39;t work we</text>
  <text start="116.57" dur="3.929">know this with gold and silver this is</text>
  <text start="118.88" dur="3.93">why they continually tell us that gold</text>
  <text start="120.499" dur="4.531">is a barbarous relic it can&amp;#39;t be used</text>
  <text start="122.81" dur="4.89">for anything except for jewelry there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="125.03" dur="5.88">no need to own it whatsoever we see this</text>
  <text start="127.7" dur="6.21">as happening with crypto currencies we</text>
  <text start="130.91" dur="6.96">first had Christine Lagarde out there</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="5.85">the biz out there all demonizing Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="137.87" dur="4.56">even parts of the Federal Reserve were</text>
  <text start="139.76" dur="4.98">out there demonizing Bitcoin crypto</text>
  <text start="142.43" dur="4.5">currencies you name it we have Janet</text>
  <text start="144.74" dur="4.5">Yellen out there right now the former</text>
  <text start="146.93" dur="3.72">Federal Reserve chair and she was</text>
  <text start="149.24" dur="2.969">talking about cryptocurrencies and</text>
  <text start="150.65" dur="3.6">Bitcoin and things like that and she</text>
  <text start="152.209" dur="4.321">said the following Bitcoin is anything</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="4.29">but a useful store of value and she went</text>
  <text start="156.53" dur="4.74">on to say it has long been thought that</text>
  <text start="158.54" dur="4.86">for something to be a useful currency it</text>
  <text start="161.27" dur="3.75">needs to be stable source of value and</text>
  <text start="163.4" dur="4.23">bitcoin is anything</text>
  <text start="165.02" dur="4.47">but well the first thing is that we know</text>
  <text start="167.63" dur="3.84">that bitcoin was manipulated we know</text>
  <text start="169.49" dur="4.79">they were dumping a huge amount of coins</text>
  <text start="171.47" dur="4.65">can you imagine if someone dumped</text>
  <text start="174.28" dur="4.33">dollars hmm</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="3.96">like if dollars flowed back from the</text>
  <text start="178.61" dur="4.98">Middle East what would happen to the</text>
  <text start="180.08" dur="5.43">dollar exactly we all know what would</text>
  <text start="183.59" dur="4.29">happen to the dollar it would lose value</text>
  <text start="185.51" dur="4.62">and it would take more dollars to buy</text>
  <text start="187.88" dur="4.68">the same products this is what we saw</text>
  <text start="190.13" dur="4.5">when Bitcoin they dumped a lot of</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="3.96">Bitcoin this was done on purpose they</text>
  <text start="194.63" dur="4.38">were building it up and they wanted to</text>
  <text start="196.52" dur="8.16">make make it look like Bitcoin was</text>
  <text start="199.01" dur="8.16">volatile the dollar is not so stable it</text>
  <text start="204.68" dur="6.33">has lost 98 percent of its value over</text>
  <text start="207.17" dur="5.79">time and when those dollars from the</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="3.48">Middle East come back because once those</text>
  <text start="212.96" dur="5.4">countries decide not to use the dollar</text>
  <text start="214.49" dur="5.37">to pay for oil guess what those dollars</text>
  <text start="218.36" dur="4.29">are going to be dumped back on the</text>
  <text start="219.86" dur="4.11">United States and we can see the central</text>
  <text start="222.65" dur="4.14">bank they&amp;#39;re very very worried and</text>
  <text start="223.97" dur="4.71">nervous about cryptocurrency if they</text>
  <text start="226.79" dur="4.83">weren&amp;#39;t they wouldn&amp;#39;t be mentioning it</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="6.029">so much which tells us something which</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="5.43">tells us they&amp;#39;re very worried about</text>
  <text start="234.709" dur="6.301">crypto currencies because they know that</text>
  <text start="237.05" dur="8.13">this could easily replace the dollar</text>
  <text start="241.01" dur="6.9">with absolutely no problem I mean think</text>
  <text start="245.18" dur="5.57">about it right now the infrastructure is</text>
  <text start="247.91" dur="7.44">already set up everyone uses a phone</text>
  <text start="250.75" dur="7.57">everyone knows how to use the electronic</text>
  <text start="255.35" dur="6.54">banking system having a wallet is not</text>
  <text start="258.32" dur="5.18">that different and it would be a very</text>
  <text start="261.89" dur="5.25">easy transition</text>
  <text start="263.5" dur="5.44">we know that the central bankers we know</text>
  <text start="267.14" dur="4.38">that the deep state they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="268.94" dur="4.89">their agenda that try to shift the</text>
  <text start="271.52" dur="3.78">narrative away from what Trump and the</text>
  <text start="273.83" dur="3.66">Patriots have been doing I mean Trump</text>
  <text start="275.3" dur="3.75">and the Patriots they&amp;#39;ve been creating</text>
  <text start="277.49" dur="3.84">this narrative in the economy that the</text>
  <text start="279.05" dur="4.23">economy is doing fantastically they have</text>
  <text start="281.33" dur="4.38">to do this this is being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="283.28" dur="4.02">so this way nothing is blamed on Trump</text>
  <text start="285.71" dur="3.36">and the Patriots when the entire system</text>
  <text start="287.3" dur="3.24">comes down we know we&amp;#39;re living in an</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="4.23">illusion we know these numbers are fake</text>
  <text start="290.54" dur="6.16">we know all of this Obama was out there</text>
  <text start="293.3" dur="6.1">and he was trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="296.7" dur="4.5">that the real boom to this economy</text>
  <text start="299.4" dur="3.81">really started with him and this is</text>
  <text start="301.2" dur="3.81">really his economy what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="4.89">to do and this is not just for the</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="5.55">elections they&amp;#39;re trying to shift the</text>
  <text start="308.1" dur="3.96">narrative to make it seem like Trump</text>
  <text start="310.56" dur="4.83">really had nothing to do with this</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="4.98">economy and they&amp;#39;re trying to show</text>
  <text start="315.39" dur="4.11">everyone that if this system comes down</text>
  <text start="317.04" dur="2.88">it&amp;#39;s really not his economy but guess</text>
  <text start="319.5" dur="2.85">what</text>
  <text start="319.92" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s not going to work I mean Obama was</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="5.55">out there and he said by the time I left</text>
  <text start="324.69" dur="5.37">office wages were rising really oh we</text>
  <text start="327.9" dur="3.69">have a graph of the wages and when he</text>
  <text start="330.06" dur="4.86">was leaving office they were actually</text>
  <text start="331.59" dur="5.49">declining actually wages were falling</text>
  <text start="334.92" dur="3.3">since he took office they popped up a</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="1.94">little bit then they started declining</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="3.39">again</text>
  <text start="339.02" dur="4.9">poverty was falling I mean is he out of</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="5.25">his mind this is why we&amp;#39;ve been tracking</text>
  <text start="343.92" dur="4.65">all of this this is by this is why we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="3.96">been looking at the economy the entire</text>
  <text start="348.57" dur="4.77">time so this way that we can look back</text>
  <text start="350.82" dur="4.74">in time and say yeah you know what no we</text>
  <text start="353.34" dur="5.43">were following this wages were not going</text>
  <text start="355.56" dur="5.13">up people were not you know coming out</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="5.91">of poverty actually more people were</text>
  <text start="360.69" dur="6.99">going into poverty under Obama and we</text>
  <text start="364.68" dur="5.13">see that less people were working has</text>
  <text start="367.68" dur="3.9">anything really changed now all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="369.81" dur="4.38">doing right now is they&amp;#39;re manipulating</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="4.5">the numbers that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re doing at</text>
  <text start="374.19" dur="4.14">this point so why are they arguing back</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="4.47">and forth and whose economy this is well</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="4.17">one is for the elections but once again</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="3.96">the election is gonna be over very very</text>
  <text start="382.5" dur="4.23">quickly it&amp;#39;s only one day boom and</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re over the real reason they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="386.73" dur="6.54">trying to push this right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="389.28" dur="6.78">trying to control the narrative and what</text>
  <text start="393.27" dur="6.53">Obama&amp;#39;s doing right now it&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="396.06" dur="7.65">going to work this is a failed approach</text>
  <text start="399.8" dur="6.28">like Trump said he has the magic wand</text>
  <text start="403.71" dur="4.71">which means he can manipulate the data</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="4.77">any way he wants and guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="408.42" dur="4.05">never gonna come out and say that all of</text>
  <text start="410.85" dur="4.74">this data is manipulated because it</text>
  <text start="412.47" dur="6.18">would be the end of them it would be the</text>
  <text start="415.59" dur="5.04">end of Obama the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="418.65" dur="4.46">Federal Reserve and everything else so</text>
  <text start="420.63" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re never gonna go in that direction</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="5.68">we see John Bolton out there is putting</text>
  <text start="425.85" dur="4.709">out another message and we know this is</text>
  <text start="428.79" dur="4.499">an obvious statement but</text>
  <text start="430.559" dur="6.03">he&amp;#39;s out there saying that the high</text>
  <text start="433.289" dur="7.08">level of national debt is an economic</text>
  <text start="436.589" dur="5.55">threat to the United States now he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="440.369" dur="3.39">saying something that everyone doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="442.139" dur="2.58">really know a lot of people think the</text>
  <text start="443.759" dur="2.76">debt is good because they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="444.719" dur="3.42">brainwashing to thinking that debt is</text>
  <text start="446.519" dur="2.97">good because under the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="448.139" dur="3.75">System under the central bank system</text>
  <text start="449.489" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed to think that oh</text>
  <text start="451.889" dur="3.51">if you have more in your credit card</text>
  <text start="453.419" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s fantastic if you have more loans</text>
  <text start="455.399" dur="5.4">out there it&amp;#39;s fantastic I mean think</text>
  <text start="458.099" dur="4.02">about how they judge retail and</text>
  <text start="460.799" dur="4.2">everything else they look at the credit</text>
  <text start="462.119" dur="4.62">card data they look at how much people</text>
  <text start="464.999" dur="3.27">have taken out when they look at the</text>
  <text start="466.739" dur="3.62">auto industry how many loans have been</text>
  <text start="468.269" dur="3.99">taken out when they look at the</text>
  <text start="470.359" dur="3.99">education system of people going to</text>
  <text start="472.259" dur="5.64">college they look at student loans</text>
  <text start="474.349" dur="6.34">they&amp;#39;re always telling you about how</text>
  <text start="477.899" dur="5.03">much people are borrowed equating that</text>
  <text start="480.689" dur="5.7">to how great the economy&amp;#39;s doing and</text>
  <text start="482.929" dur="5.71">that&amp;#39;s not a good gauge because the more</text>
  <text start="486.389" dur="3.78">you borrow the worse off it is the</text>
  <text start="488.639" dur="3.21">better it is for the central bank system</text>
  <text start="490.169" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s worse off for the everyday person</text>
  <text start="491.849" dur="6.72">but what Bolton is doing right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="495.029" dur="7.5">laying the groundwork for what is to</text>
  <text start="498.569" dur="6.03">come he&amp;#39;s letting everyone know that the</text>
  <text start="502.529" dur="4.59">high level of debt that the United</text>
  <text start="504.599" dur="4.35">States took on because of the central</text>
  <text start="507.119" dur="5.46">bank because of what happened back in</text>
  <text start="508.949" dur="7.47">1913 is an economic threat to the United</text>
  <text start="512.579" dur="5.52">States the debt level is the worst thing</text>
  <text start="516.419" dur="2.16">that could have happened to the United</text>
  <text start="518.099" dur="3.12">States</text>
  <text start="518.579" dur="5.31">the central bank being put into place</text>
  <text start="521.219" dur="4.59">and making the United States go into</text>
  <text start="523.889" dur="4.2">debt is the worst thing that could have</text>
  <text start="525.809" dur="4.621">happened because now the control moves</text>
  <text start="528.089" dur="3.72">over to the central bank this is what</text>
  <text start="530.43" dur="4.07">Trump of the Patriots have been fighting</text>
  <text start="531.809" dur="5.911">the deep state the central bank</text>
  <text start="534.5" dur="5.11">countries around the world they also</text>
  <text start="537.72" dur="5.01">have the same problem of course when the</text>
  <text start="539.61" dur="5.19">EU was implemented a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="542.73" dur="5.219">started to go into debt a lot more debt</text>
  <text start="544.8" dur="6.269">than normally they were used to and they</text>
  <text start="547.949" dur="5.341">had a bag for currency to help the</text>
  <text start="551.069" dur="3.63">country out and of course what did the</text>
  <text start="553.29" dur="2.909">central bankers do I mean think about</text>
  <text start="554.699" dur="4.11">Greece think about Cyprus think about</text>
  <text start="556.199" dur="5.161">all the countries Italy France they made</text>
  <text start="558.809" dur="4.321">them push certain laws like austerity</text>
  <text start="561.36" dur="4.41">and</text>
  <text start="563.13" dur="5.7">this is how the central bankers control</text>
  <text start="565.77" dur="5.22">all this now Trump and the Patriots with</text>
  <text start="568.83" dur="3.54">a been doing all this time is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="570.99" dur="3.08">been building the narrative to get rid</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="3.78">of the central banking system and the</text>
  <text start="574.07" dur="3.37">establishment they have come out and</text>
  <text start="576.15" dur="2.94">we&amp;#39;ve seen many different articles where</text>
  <text start="577.44" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re defending the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="579.09" dur="4.65">and we see out of the New Yorker the</text>
  <text start="581.1" dur="5.28">headline reads Donald Trump&amp;#39;s loco</text>
  <text start="583.74" dur="4.77">attack on the Federal Reserve The New</text>
  <text start="586.38" dur="6.66">Yorker is defending the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="588.51" dur="6.96">as an institution of government now we</text>
  <text start="593.04" dur="5.43">know the Federal Reserve is not an</text>
  <text start="595.47" dur="4.41">institution of government has nothing to</text>
  <text start="598.47" dur="5.97">do with the government</text>
  <text start="599.88" dur="6.12">it is a private corporation and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="604.44" dur="5.19">something that should have never been</text>
  <text start="606" dur="5.49">allowed Andrew Jackson and many others</text>
  <text start="609.63" dur="6.18">the founding fathers have they fought</text>
  <text start="611.49" dur="6.36">against this this entire time and they</text>
  <text start="615.81" dur="4.65">never wanted a central bank to be put</text>
  <text start="617.85" dur="6.65">into place but what the establishment is</text>
  <text start="620.46" dur="8.09">doing is they&amp;#39;re projecting out there</text>
  <text start="624.5" dur="7.6">the idea that the Federal Reserve is</text>
