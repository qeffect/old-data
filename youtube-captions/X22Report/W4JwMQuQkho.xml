  <text start="327.36" dur="5.7">boost in people shopping online and</text>
  <text start="330.569" dur="5.581">people spent more online but you</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="5.579">remember even if this moves up to 15% of</text>

  <text start="338.639" dur="3.99">translate from the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="340.8" dur="5.239">everyone moving to online remember</text>

  <text start="352.319" dur="5.961">billion to seven billion but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.259" dur="6.72">meaningless in a trillion dollar</text>
  <text start="358.28" dur="6.099">business because what&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="361.979" dur="4.74">yeah online might have went up four</text>
  <text start="364.379" dur="6.331">billion but the brick-and-mortar stores</text>
  <text start="366.719" dur="5.88">lost 60 billion so I mean I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="370.71" dur="4.019">throwing these numbers out but what does</text>
  <text start="372.599" dur="4.051">that really tell you it tells you that</text>
  <text start="374.729" dur="3.21">it&amp;#39;s meaningless what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="376.65" dur="4.379">say this is why they always tell you</text>
  <text start="377.939" dur="5.401">look online business has boosted their</text>
  <text start="381.029" dur="4.5">sales by four billion they didn&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="383.34" dur="3.629">you the other side of all the losses now</text>
  <text start="385.529" dur="4.471">they did this last year the year before</text>
  <text start="386.969" dur="5.76">this where they told you oh look online</text>
  <text start="390" dur="4.759">sales three billion dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="392.729" dur="4.68">sales but they didn&amp;#39;t tell you that</text>
  <text start="394.759" dur="5.201">brick-and-mortar lost hundreds of</text>
  <text start="397.409" dur="4.38">billions of sales and it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="399.96" dur="4.769">translate we know right now that the</text>
  <text start="401.789" dur="5.761">real estate market continually pushes up</text>
  <text start="404.729" dur="5.97">and up and the housing prices are</text>
  <text start="407.55" dur="5.339">skyrocketing we see Case Shiller and</text>
  <text start="410.699" dur="5.4">their latest data is showing you know</text>
  <text start="412.889" dur="6.33">out of the twenty cities the housing</text>
  <text start="416.099" dur="5.511">prices have hit all-time new highs now</text>
  <text start="419.219" dur="5.521">we need to understand something</text>
  <text start="421.61" dur="4.989">wages are not keeping up with this now</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re seeing this up in Canada where</text>
  <text start="426.599" dur="4.081">this is a telltale sign that this is a</text>
  <text start="428.46" dur="4.62">housing bubble in Canada because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.68" dur="3.84">out of the reach of the people here in</text>
  <text start="433.08" dur="4.049">the United States we would see mortgage</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="5.31">applications keeping up with the number</text>
  <text start="437.129" dur="4.021">of purchases of homes and as the prices</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="2.88">of homes go up in these twenty cities</text>
  <text start="441.15" dur="4.59">and again this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="5.16">controlling the income in these cities</text>
  <text start="445.74" dur="4.859">well they&amp;#39;re it&amp;#39;s not keeping up now</text>
  <text start="447.87" dur="4.45">think about this for a second let&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="450.599" dur="5.231">all this data into</text>
  <text start="452.32" dur="5.55">context and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="455.83" dur="5.88">different cities like Los Angeles San</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="6.35">Francisco New York San Diego we need to</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="7.74">figure out how much household income</text>
  <text start="464.22" dur="8.56">needs to increase to afford these houses</text>
  <text start="469.45" dur="4.65">in these cities in Los Angeles it would</text>
  <text start="472.78" dur="4.32">have to increase by a hundred and</text>
  <text start="474.1" dur="8.22">twenty-two percent in San Francisco a</text>

  <text start="492.34" dur="6.33">at the national average well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="495.34" dur="6.78">increasing by six percent there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="498.67" dur="5.82">that the American people can keep up</text>
  <text start="502.12" dur="4.35">with this bubble and this is when</text>
  <text start="504.49" dur="4.02">bubbles pop and we&amp;#39;re seeing it in</text>

  <text start="851.619" dur="6.321">we need to remember something there</text>
  <text start="853.59" dur="7.68">important here is that this whole system</text>
  <text start="857.94" dur="7.89">was based on having the dollar attached</text>
  <text start="861.27" dur="8.19">to oil and we know that this is falling</text>

  <text start="1147.23" dur="7.08">they know is that this is actually</text>
  <text start="1150.08" dur="6.54">moving from west to east and they</text>
  <text start="1154.31" dur="4.86">pointed out in this document that yes</text>
  <text start="1156.62" dur="5.16">China and Russia they are competitors</text>
  <text start="1159.17" dur="5.37">and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="1161.78" dur="4.8">everything will move from west to east</text>
  <text start="1164.54" dur="4.47">and we&amp;#39;re gonna go through this major</text>

  <text start="1169.01" dur="5.46">economy of the West is really rapidly</text>
  <text start="1171.92" dur="4.11">falling apart yes on the surface with</text>

  <text start="1178.85" dur="3.99">difficult to see this go back to 2008</text>
  <text start="1181.19" dur="4.86">when the market was hitting 14,000</text>
  <text start="1182.84" dur="5.82">points very difficult to understand what</text>
  <text start="1186.05" dur="5.67">was happening until the market came down</text>
  <text start="1188.66" dur="5.67">and once the market came down then the</text>
  <text start="1191.72" dur="6.03">truth came out all these corporations</text>
  <text start="1194.33" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re having trouble the automobile</text>

  <text start="1211.31" dur="8.34">finally comes down you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1215.24" dur="6.63">the truth come out that all along this</text>
  <text start="1219.65" dur="4.65">whole thing was built up on a gigantic</text>

  <text start="1227.48" dur="3.42">course they don&amp;#39;t want people to see</text>
  <text start="1228.8" dur="4.38">this and this is why they need some type</text>

  <text start="1234.59" dur="4.41">people are not going to want the central</text>
