  <text start="64.44" dur="6.6">episode is the storm is upon us and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="67.68" dur="5.07">getting stronger let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="5.25">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.75" dur="6.42">geopolitical news now today the US House</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="5.13">Intel committee they threw in the towel</text>
  <text start="79.17" dur="5.04">on the Russian collusion thing after 14</text>
  <text start="81.42" dur="4.83">months they couldn&amp;#39;t find anything there</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="4.32">was no evidence of collusion there was</text>
  <text start="86.25" dur="4.979">no evidence of conspiracy between the</text>
  <text start="88.53" dur="5.1">trunk campaign and the Russians nothing</text>
  <text start="91.229" dur="5.581">was found whatsoever</text>
  <text start="93.63" dur="5.22">and I don&amp;#39;t think that Robert Mueller is</text>
  <text start="96.81" dur="4.5">gonna find anything either because if he</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="3.96">did find something it&amp;#39;d be plastered all</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="3.54">over the corporate media he&amp;#39;d be making</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="4.41">a really big deal he wouldn&amp;#39;t be coming</text>
  <text start="104.85" dur="4.01">out with oh man affort lied or this</text>
  <text start="107.22" dur="4.289">person lied to the FBI</text>
  <text start="108.86" dur="4.99">especially when the FBI continually lies</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="5.071">to the American people that is not</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="6.57">Russian collusion everything that he is</text>
  <text start="116.58" dur="6.6">bringing up is little tiny nothings</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="4.47">that nobody would even care about and</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="3.9">the only reason they&amp;#39;re making it a</text>
  <text start="124.89" dur="4.86">really big deal is because they have</text>
  <text start="127.08" dur="6.21">nothing they have no evidence they have</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="6.66">no proof his entire time investigating</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="6.15">this was a waste of time and we knew</text>
  <text start="136.41" dur="5.82">this from the beginning because CNN</text>
  <text start="139.44" dur="4.29">through Project Veritas admitted it was</text>
  <text start="142.23" dur="4.38">a nothing burger it was completely</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="5.52">made-up but everyone went along with it</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="6">because they needed to get Trump out of</text>
  <text start="149.25" dur="7.5">office that was their main objective we</text>
  <text start="152.61" dur="7.53">see the storm is getting stronger Trump</text>
  <text start="156.75" dur="5.34">is now removing certain individuals from</text>
  <text start="160.14" dur="3.87">different positions within the White</text>
  <text start="162.09" dur="4.02">House now when he first came into the</text>
  <text start="164.01" dur="3.72">White House yes there were Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="166.11" dur="4.67">people yes there were certain</text>
  <text start="167.73" dur="7.17">individuals well in his administration</text>
  <text start="170.78" dur="6.04">this was set up by still those in power</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="4.92">who said listen these are the people</text>
  <text start="176.82" dur="6.33">that you need so he took them on now</text>
  <text start="179.82" dur="5.49">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a turnover where he</text>
  <text start="183.15" dur="4.86">is setting up his own cabinet is it</text>
  <text start="185.31" dur="5.039">Pleet yet absolutely not he needs to go</text>
  <text start="188.01" dur="4.29">through many more rounds to weed a lot</text>
  <text start="190.349" dur="4.47">more people out but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="192.3" dur="5.04">that Rex Tillerson he is gone</text>
  <text start="194.819" dur="5.851">undersecretary Steve Goldstein is gone</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="4.8">we know that Cowan is gone and there are</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="4.26">many other individuals that are going to</text>
  <text start="202.14" dur="5.97">be removed from all this now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="6.75">interesting is that Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="208.11" dur="5.159">Rex Tillerson was out there and he was</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="3.48">blaming Russia for the chemical attack</text>
  <text start="213.269" dur="3.33">in the UK now of course there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="215.16" dur="3.45">evidence whatsoever and we&amp;#39;ll get into</text>
  <text start="216.599" dur="4.381">that in just a minute but it looks like</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="3.659">right after that tweet all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="220.98" dur="4.979">he was fired</text>
  <text start="222.269" dur="7.461">now Tillerson is being replaced by CIA</text>
  <text start="225.959" dur="7.651">director Mike Pompeo and now since</text>
  <text start="229.73" dur="6.58">Pompeo has moved into his position well</text>
  <text start="233.61" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s the director of the CIA position</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="5.009">that is completely open and that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.11" dur="5.37">being filled by Gena Haspel she&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="241.319" dur="4.5">current deputy director of the CIA now</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="5.52">do I think these are two good choices</text>
  <text start="245.819" dur="8.911">for these offices absolutely not</text>
  <text start="249" dur="7.769">and Haspel by the way if confirmed by</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="5.91">the Senate would be the very first</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="6.241">female head of the CIA the one thing</text>
  <text start="260.64" dur="4.74">that we&amp;#39;re looking at here is the</text>
  <text start="263.01" dur="6">background of these individuals do they</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="6.11">fit into Trump&amp;#39;s plan and I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="269.01" dur="5.4">they do Edward Snowden was out there and</text>
  <text start="271.49" dur="4.96">he tweeted that the new CIA director was</text>
  <text start="274.41" dur="4.29">a key part of the torture program and</text>
  <text start="276.45" dur="3.839">it&amp;#39;s illegal cover-up her name was on</text>
  <text start="278.7" dur="3.6">the top-secret order demanding the</text>
  <text start="280.289" dur="4.981">destruction of tapes to prevent them</text>
  <text start="282.3" dur="5.07">from being seen by Congress incredible</text>
  <text start="285.27" dur="4.769">he then noted that the new CIA director</text>
  <text start="287.37" dur="4.62">Haspel who tortured some folks probably</text>
  <text start="290.039" dur="5.071">can&amp;#39;t travel to the EU to meet other spy</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="5.549">chiefs without facing arrest due to a</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="4.679">complaint to Germany&amp;#39;s federal</text>
  <text start="297.539" dur="4.711">prosecutor and Julian Assange was out</text>
  <text start="299.789" dur="5.581">there and he was tweeting about Mike</text>
  <text start="302.25" dur="5.16">Pompeo because you know he wanted to get</text>
  <text start="305.37" dur="5.04">Julian Assange wanted to get WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="307.41" dur="5.729">and I think these individuals are being</text>
  <text start="310.41" dur="6.78">put into these positions to expose them</text>
  <text start="313.139" dur="6">to eventually get rid of them and to</text>
  <text start="317.19" dur="4.289">clean the entire</text>
  <text start="319.139" dur="3.541">apartment out I don&amp;#39;t think he was just</text>
  <text start="321.479" dur="3.301">gonna go and say you&amp;#39;re fired because</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="3.87">they would make a really big stink about</text>
  <text start="324.78" dur="3.9">it and I think he&amp;#39;s using a strategy of</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="4.38">bringing them up there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="328.68" dur="2.91">questions about what they&amp;#39;ve done in the</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="3">past</text>
  <text start="331.59" dur="4.979">the Senate&amp;#39;s gonna ask him a lot of</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="3.12">questions and they might even turn them</text>
  <text start="336.569" dur="2.611">down</text>
  <text start="337.05" dur="4.26">so we&amp;#39;ll have to watch and see how this</text>
  <text start="339.18" dur="5.4">is but I believe this is a strategy to</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="5.699">basically clean all these individuals</text>
  <text start="344.58" dur="5.13">out just like he&amp;#39;s cleaned</text>
  <text start="347.009" dur="7.171">the others out and I think this is going</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="6.09">to continue on Trump is also laying the</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="3.75">groundwork to introduce the death</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="4.5">penalty for drug dealers now if if this</text>
  <text start="357.93" dur="4.47">is absolutely true he&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="360.3" dur="5.519">following in the footsteps of do-dirty</text>
  <text start="362.4" dur="6.21">in the Philippines and when I I think</text>
  <text start="365.819" dur="5.91">when I hear this and I see this this is</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="7.619">not to get the low-level drug dealer</text>
  <text start="371.729" dur="7.44">I think he&amp;#39;s going after the CIA the</text>
  <text start="376.229" dur="6.21">intelligence community the biggest drug</text>
  <text start="379.169" dur="5.881">dealers in the world and I think this is</text>
  <text start="382.439" dur="5.85">why he&amp;#39;s laying the groundwork to</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="4.85">introduce this because remember they</text>
  <text start="388.289" dur="5.791">operate the poppy field in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="7.96">they sell the opium across the world for</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="7.079">covert operations drug smuggling between</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="6.769">here and Mexico and the war on drugs was</text>
  <text start="401.159" dur="7.081">the war on the CIA&amp;#39;s competition and</text>
  <text start="404.629" dur="7.051">they&amp;#39;re the biggest drug dealers and I</text>
  <text start="408.24" dur="7.109">think this is why he most likely is</text>
  <text start="411.68" dur="5.639">pushing this agenda forward now it looks</text>
  <text start="415.349" dur="5.82">like the poisoning of scruple is</text>
  <text start="417.319" dur="8.65">starting to heat up right now and we see</text>
  <text start="421.169" dur="7.74">that the UK Theresa May is out there she</text>
  <text start="425.969" dur="4.98">is blaming Russia saying that they have</text>
  <text start="428.909" dur="5.07">to prove their innocence instead of them</text>
  <text start="430.949" dur="5.37">proving that they&amp;#39;re guilty and they</text>
  <text start="433.979" dur="5.821">really don&amp;#39;t have that much evidence the</text>
  <text start="436.319" dur="5.13">only thing they have where Theresa May</text>
  <text start="439.8" dur="6.229">is out there saying that we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="441.449" dur="10.811">Russia is the poison that was used was</text>
  <text start="446.029" dur="9.081">created by the Soviet Union it dubbed</text>
  <text start="452.26" dur="9.72">nova truck and was used in the poisoning</text>
  <text start="455.11" dur="8.85">of sergey skripnikov details of the</text>
  <text start="461.98" dur="3.63">program saying otherwise London would</text>
  <text start="463.96" dur="4.02">consider the poisoning an attack</text>
  <text start="465.61" dur="5.22">directed by the Russian government and</text>
  <text start="467.98" dur="7.89">Lavrov is out there saying that listen</text>
  <text start="470.83" dur="7.5">if you&amp;#39;d like to pursue this you need to</text>
  <text start="475.87" dur="4.17">go through the proper channels the</text>
  <text start="478.33" dur="5.46">organization for the prohibition of</text>
  <text start="480.04" dur="8.61">chemical weapons will handle this Russia</text>
  <text start="483.79" dur="7.68">and Britain are members let&amp;#39;s do this so</text>
  <text start="488.65" dur="5.82">let&amp;#39;s look at the evidence that the UK</text>
  <text start="491.47" dur="4.59">has we know that Sergei scruple on his</text>
  <text start="494.47" dur="4.56">daughter they were poisoned with a</text>
  <text start="496.06" dur="6">military-grade nerve agent of a type</text>
  <text start="499.03" dur="4.89">developed by the Soviet Union the nerve</text>
  <text start="502.06" dur="5.04">agent was a part of a group of agents</text>
  <text start="503.92" dur="5.58">known as nova truck Russia has</text>
  <text start="507.1" dur="4.44">previously produced the agent and would</text>
  <text start="509.5" dur="4.229">still be capable of doing so</text>
  <text start="511.54" dur="4.53">the British government assesses that</text>
  <text start="513.729" dur="4.801">Russia view some defectors as legitimate</text>
  <text start="516.07" dur="5.34">targets the British government concluded</text>
  <text start="518.53" dur="5.48">that it is highly likely that Russia was</text>
  <text start="521.41" dur="5.6">responsible for the act against sergey</text>
  <text start="524.01" dur="3">skripnikov</text>
  <text start="528.67" dur="5.07">to say the following this was either a</text>
  <text start="531.25" dur="4.71">direct act by the russian state against</text>
  <text start="533.74" dur="3.63">the united kingdom or the russian</text>
  <text start="535.96" dur="4.49">government lost control the nerve agent</text>
  <text start="537.37" dur="6.45">and let it fall into the hands of others</text>
  <text start="540.45" dur="4.12">now a lot of this saying seems a little</text>
  <text start="543.82" dur="3.99">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="544.57" dur="6.15">first of all nova chuck newcomers in</text>
  <text start="547.81" dur="4.77">English are a zoo of chemical warfare</text>
  <text start="550.72" dur="5.25">agents that were developed in the Soviet</text>
  <text start="552.58" dur="6.11">Union in the 70s and 80s some of the</text>
  <text start="555.97" dur="5.85">newcomers are said to be highly toxic</text>
  <text start="558.69" dur="6.16">the existence of these chemical agents</text>
  <text start="561.82" dur="5.04">was disclosed in 1992 Russia joined the</text>
  <text start="564.85" dur="3.75">Convention on the prohibition of the</text>

  <text start="568.6" dur="6.09">use of chemical weapons and on their</text>
  <text start="570.61" dur="6.99">destruction in 1997 it has since unlike</text>
  <text start="574.69" dur="5.4">the u.s. destroyed all leftover stocks</text>
  <text start="577.6" dur="5.07">from the Soviet Union chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="580.09" dur="5.43">program it does not produce chemical</text>
  <text start="582.67" dur="3.539">weapons these agents and their formulas</text>
  <text start="585.52" dur="4.039">are not</text>
  <text start="586.209" dur="6.36">exclusively Russian knowledge or product</text>
  <text start="589.559" dur="4.991">one of the key manufacturing sites was</text>
  <text start="592.569" dur="4.02">the Soviet state Scientific Research</text>
  <text start="594.55" dur="5.159">Institute for organic chemistry and</text>
  <text start="596.589" dur="6.571">technology in Uzbekistan</text>
  <text start="599.709" dur="6.451">now the formulas for the various Novacek</text>
  <text start="603.16" dur="6.45">agents are not a Russian secret the US</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="5.099">the UK know how to make these the</text>
  <text start="609.61" dur="3.089">important down chemical weapon</text>
  <text start="611.259" dur="5.43">Laboratory of the British military is</text>
  <text start="612.699" dur="6.18">only eight miles away from Salsbury</text>
  <text start="616.689" dur="5.161">where scruples were allegedly poisoned</text>
  <text start="618.879" dur="4.861">the British government claims the port</text>
  <text start="621.85" dur="5.37">and down identified the agent allegedly</text>
  <text start="623.74" dur="6.12">used on the scribbles the laboratories</text>
  <text start="627.22" dur="5.309">surely also capable of producing such</text>
  <text start="629.86" dur="6.389">stuff just like other laboratories and</text>
  <text start="632.529" dur="6.9">other countries are able to do so we can</text>
  <text start="636.249" dur="6.301">see right now that Russia is not the</text>
  <text start="639.429" dur="4.71">only country that can produce us and</text>
  <text start="642.55" dur="5.43">actually they&amp;#39;re not even producing it</text>
  <text start="644.139" dur="6.63">there was a Soviet Union chemical that</text>
  <text start="647.98" dur="5.789">was produced back then other countries</text>
  <text start="650.769" dur="6.841">can produce it other individuals can</text>
  <text start="653.769" dur="6.63">have it and other people can use it it</text>
  <text start="657.61" dur="7.5">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense that Russia was going</text>
  <text start="660.399" dur="7.16">to use this actually scribble was</text>
  <text start="665.11" dur="5.159">involved with the de Steele dossier</text>
  <text start="667.559" dur="4.541">which means the Clintons are involved</text>
  <text start="670.269" dur="3.81">which means Christopher Steele is</text>
  <text start="672.1" dur="4.739">involved which means there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="674.079" dur="5.7">investigation going on with these</text>
  <text start="676.839" dur="8.04">individuals so why would the Russians</text>
  <text start="679.779" dur="8.131">care and think about this may is out</text>
  <text start="684.879" dur="5.52">there saying that well Russia sees some</text>
  <text start="687.91" dur="4.679">defectors as legitimate targets well</text>
  <text start="690.399" dur="6.63">scribble was living openly in the UK</text>
  <text start="692.589" dur="7.141">since 2010 why kill him now what&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="697.029" dur="6.571">would be the motive there is no motive</text>
  <text start="699.73" dur="7.829">this is a made-up story and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="703.6" dur="7.169">trying to put the blame on Russia now we</text>
  <text start="707.559" dur="7.051">see out of the Daily Mail Teresa may</text>
  <text start="710.769" dur="7.65">might use cyberattacks to retaliate</text>
  <text start="714.61" dur="5.1">against Russia I mean listen to what</text>
  <text start="718.419" dur="4.531">they&amp;#39;re doing here</text>
  <text start="719.71" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re trying to create an incident</text>
