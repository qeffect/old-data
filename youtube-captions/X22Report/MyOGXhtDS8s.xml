  <text start="88.03" dur="5.55">savings let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="90.61" dur="5.369">collapse financial news now I keep</text>
  <text start="93.58" dur="3.569">talking about this economic illusion</text>
  <text start="95.979" dur="4.411">that were in and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="97.149" dur="5.881">that this economic illusion started back</text>
  <text start="100.39" dur="5.57">in 1913 I mean we couldn&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="103.03" dur="4.979">clearly back then but it all began</text>
  <text start="105.96" dur="5.17">during that period of time</text>
  <text start="108.009" dur="7.411">and then when we hit World War two the</text>
  <text start="111.13" dur="10.379">illusion continued to phase two then</text>
  <text start="115.42" dur="13.11">when we hit 1971 1970 we went into phase</text>
  <text start="121.509" dur="9.691">3 and here we are today with an economic</text>
  <text start="128.53" dur="6.12">illusion that is completely obvious</text>
  <text start="131.2" dur="6.3">because once we hit 2008 they needed to</text>
  <text start="134.65" dur="5.91">go into phase four and that was money</text>
  <text start="137.5" dur="5.76">printing that was taking what we have</text>
  <text start="140.56" dur="4.59">today and allowing the Fed to do</text>
  <text start="143.26" dur="4.11">whatever they needed to do to keep the</text>
  <text start="145.15" dur="6.27">system alive because without that the</text>
  <text start="147.37" dur="6.81">entire system would have died so they</text>
  <text start="151.42" dur="5.49">had to create some type of an event it</text>
  <text start="154.18" dur="4.889">was planned of course and they had to</text>
  <text start="156.91" dur="5.1">make it seem like we were in trouble</text>
  <text start="159.069" dur="5.941">well we would have been in trouble if we</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="5.559">didn&amp;#39;t allow the Fed to do what they did</text>
  <text start="165.01" dur="4.63">companies were gonna all go under but</text>
  <text start="167.569" dur="4.111">this was all planned they knew they had</text>
  <text start="169.64" dur="4.47">to do this it wasn&amp;#39;t like they were</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="4.65">shocked or surprised that this happened</text>
  <text start="174.11" dur="4.65">this was all part of their plan their</text>
  <text start="176.33" dur="5.879">plan was to create currency because they</text>
  <text start="178.76" dur="5">knew they were going to be able to keep</text>
  <text start="182.209" dur="6.81">the system alive</text>
  <text start="183.76" dur="8.52">for a lot longer if they printed the</text>
  <text start="189.019" dur="6.181">currency bailed other central banks out</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="5.98">spread out the currency around the world</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="5.94">and gave it to the banking system this</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="5.25">would allow their system when I say</text>
  <text start="201.14" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re the central bank system to stay</text>
  <text start="203.51" dur="7.53">alive and they&amp;#39;d be able to push the</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="8.3">debt to the extreme and have countries</text>
  <text start="211.04" dur="8.49">borrow as much as they possibly could</text>
  <text start="214.39" dur="8.319">now to accomplish this they had to have</text>
  <text start="219.53" dur="6.69">manipulation they had to have control</text>
  <text start="222.709" dur="5.581">over the system because just by creating</text>
  <text start="226.22" dur="5.13">currency that doesn&amp;#39;t make the economy</text>
  <text start="228.29" dur="4.529">fine they had to make sure they were</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="2.88">able to manipulate the numbers they had</text>
  <text start="232.819" dur="2.82">to make sure they were able to</text>
  <text start="234.23" dur="5.089">manipulate the stock market they had to</text>
  <text start="235.639" dur="7.44">make sure that everyone believed it so</text>
  <text start="239.319" dur="6.311">they created a plan the central bankers</text>
  <text start="243.079" dur="3.41">had this plan of creating this gigantic</text>
  <text start="245.63" dur="4.05">illusion</text>
  <text start="246.489" dur="5.53">remember this wasn&amp;#39;t a free and open</text>
  <text start="249.68" dur="4.739">market they have the ability to make the</text>
  <text start="252.019" dur="4.351">economy look fantastic they have the</text>
  <text start="254.419" dur="3.361">ability to make the economy look so so</text>
  <text start="256.37" dur="4.679">they have the ability to make the</text>
  <text start="257.78" dur="6.27">economy crash they&amp;#39;re in total control</text>
  <text start="261.049" dur="5.311">over the system Trump right now and the</text>
  <text start="264.05" dur="7.25">Patriots they&amp;#39;re in total control of the</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="9.83">system and what we&amp;#39;re seeing today is</text>
  <text start="271.3" dur="7.33">complete chaos in the economic illusion</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="4.659">this is why when Trump is out there and</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="5.28">he&amp;#39;s talking about his numbers look how</text>
  <text start="280.849" dur="6.481">great it is we have low unemployment we</text>
  <text start="283.91" dur="4.979">have incredible GDP the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="287.33" dur="3.54">fantastic look at the stock market if</text>
  <text start="288.889" dur="4.53">you notice he&amp;#39;s pointing to all those</text>
  <text start="290.87" dur="4.65">things that were manipulated in the past</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="4.141">these are the things that the deep state</text>
  <text start="295.52" dur="3.27">the central bankers pushed out there to</text>
  <text start="297.56" dur="3.48">convince the people</text>
  <text start="298.79" dur="4.47">that the economy&amp;#39;s doing well now we</text>
  <text start="301.04" dur="3.99">really never looked at that we always</text>
  <text start="303.26" dur="5.19">looked at what was going on behind the</text>
  <text start="305.03" dur="6.24">scenes the people&amp;#39;s economy and if you</text>
  <text start="308.45" dur="4.98">notice during this time there was free</text>
  <text start="311.27" dur="5.7">money interest rates were very very low</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="7.89">allowed corporations to stay afloat they</text>
  <text start="316.97" dur="9.03">bought back their shares and they were</text>
  <text start="321.32" dur="9.24">able to continue this illusion up into</text>
  <text start="326" dur="7.56">this point now Trump he took over the</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="5.58">economy from Obama this is one illusion</text>
  <text start="333.56" dur="3.6">passing to Trump and Trump is keeping</text>
  <text start="336.14" dur="3.45">the illusion alive</text>
  <text start="337.16" dur="5.22">Trump is keeping the illusion alive for</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="4.38">a completely different reason but with</text>
  <text start="342.38" dur="4.44">everything that the companies were doing</text>
  <text start="343.97" dur="4.01">with this free money it is all coming to</text>

  <text start="426.74" dur="5.07">they know they only have control over</text>
  <text start="428.87" dur="3.82">these statistical numbers everything</text>
  <text start="431.81" dur="3.46">else</text>

  <text start="439.56" dur="4.77">you see like housing starting to decline</text>
  <text start="441.78" dur="3.27">this is why you see companies not doing</text>

  <text start="445.05" dur="5.34">the easy money days are over it only</text>
  <text start="448.23" dur="4.26">could take the economy so long because</text>
  <text start="450.39" dur="4.02">you can keep these statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="452.49" dur="3.48">as high as you want but when the</text>
  <text start="454.41" dur="3.54">people&amp;#39;s economy behind the scenes is</text>
  <text start="455.97" dur="6.39">falling apart it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="457.95" dur="6.75">explain and Trump knows this he</text>
  <text start="462.36" dur="4.98">understands this and this is why they</text>
  <text start="464.7" dur="6.54">put together this plan to bring the</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="7.05">system down and destroy not the people</text>
  <text start="471.24" dur="6.09">but the central bank system now this is</text>
  <text start="474.39" dur="6.6">a tough thing to do because you need to</text>
  <text start="477.33" dur="6.69">get us out of the central bank system</text>
  <text start="480.99" dur="6.15">and you have to move us into a brand new</text>
  <text start="484.02" dur="6.98">system not an easy task while you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.14" dur="7.65">doing this you need to get rid of and</text>
  <text start="491" dur="5.98">unwind the globalist system that they</text>
  <text start="494.79" dur="4.02">were putting into place and remember</text>
  <text start="496.98" dur="3.78">over in the many many years they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="498.81" dur="4.11">pushing companies they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="500.76" dur="4.47">manufacturing all out of the United</text>
  <text start="502.92" dur="4.44">States his task is to bring this all</text>
  <text start="505.23" dur="4.59">back and remember they&amp;#39;ve been creating</text>
  <text start="507.36" dur="4.26">regulations and taxes and everything</text>
  <text start="509.82" dur="3.51">that they could think of to keep the</text>
  <text start="511.62" dur="4.65">companies out of the US because they had</text>
  <text start="513.33" dur="5.81">completely different plans but very</text>
  <text start="516.27" dur="6.06">interestingly it seems that the Patriots</text>
  <text start="519.14" dur="6.97">Trump the team they had the Federal</text>
  <text start="522.33" dur="6.66">Reserve confused and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="526.11" dur="6.17">different you know Fed heads around the</text>
  <text start="528.99" dur="5.67">country they&amp;#39;re trying to step in and</text>
  <text start="532.28" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re trying to say no this is gonna</text>
  <text start="534.66" dur="5.7">happen no I think this is gonna happen</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="6.25">while in the meantime Powell which I</text>
  <text start="540.36" dur="6.15">still believe is on the side of Trump so</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="5.94">right now they are butting heads we have</text>
  <text start="546.51" dur="9.03">Charlie Evans now he is the Federal</text>
  <text start="549.48" dur="7.25">Reserve president of Chicago and he said</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="3.63">that the Federal Reserve officials</text>
  <text start="556.73" dur="5.47">should be in no hurry to further</text>
  <text start="559.17" dur="5.19">increase rates but he says there might</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="3.84">be two hikes this year supposed to be</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="3.2">three they said two</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="3.87">but he said we should wait and see</text>
  <text start="567.56" dur="5.23">because they know and they understand</text>
  <text start="569.91" dur="5.04">that if they continually raise rates the</text>
  <text start="572.79" dur="4.62">system comes down now remember they had</text>
  <text start="574.95" dur="5.19">a completely different plan their plan</text>
  <text start="577.41" dur="4.83">before was to continually raise rates</text>
  <text start="580.14" dur="4.14">and blame it on Trump if Clinton was</text>
  <text start="582.24" dur="4.5">office in office they were going to</text>
  <text start="584.28" dur="6.42">raise rates while she started a war</text>
  <text start="586.74" dur="5.25">which would cover everything up Trump he</text>
  <text start="590.7" dur="4.14">turned it all around and made the</text>
  <text start="591.99" dur="5.7">economy do very very well so they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="594.84" dur="3.63">a situation where their backs are</text>
  <text start="597.69" dur="3.75">against the wall</text>
  <text start="598.47" dur="6.12">and every time they raised the rates</text>
  <text start="601.44" dur="6">Trump points to them but Powell was out</text>
  <text start="604.59" dur="6.93">there and he is saying that the US</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="6.3">economy is solid his biggest worry and</text>
  <text start="611.52" dur="7.29">we mentioned this yesterday is global</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="8.45">growth so the United States is solid but</text>
  <text start="618.81" dur="8.4">the rest of the world there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="622.19" dur="6.73">think about that for a sec Powell</text>
  <text start="627.21" dur="4.11">pointed out that the u.s. may be more</text>
  <text start="628.92" dur="4.89">vulnerable to a slowdown in global</text>
  <text start="631.32" dur="7.23">growth because of the rise of globalized</text>
  <text start="633.81" dur="8.22">business and supply chains he says</text>
  <text start="638.55" dur="8.37">everything is slowing because of the</text>
  <text start="642.03" dur="7.17">globalized business the Fed chair also</text>
  <text start="646.92" dur="5.07">said the slowdown in China specifically</text>
  <text start="649.2" dur="4.77">is a concern they&amp;#39;re watching that now</text>
  <text start="651.99" dur="3.57">they he was asked about tariffs no this</text>
  <text start="653.97" dur="2.88">is very interesting because the</text>
  <text start="655.56" dur="3.27">mainstream media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="656.85" dur="4.17">tariffs is slowing down the global</text>
  <text start="658.83" dur="4.35">growth tariffs and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="661.02" dur="3.99">the IMF is slowing down the global</text>
  <text start="663.18" dur="5.03">growth coming from the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="665.01" dur="7.32">here tariffs will bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="668.21" dur="7.54">but he brushed off the idea that tariffs</text>
  <text start="672.33" dur="8.19">were even having any type of impact on</text>
  <text start="675.75" dur="9.98">either the US economy or China that</text>
  <text start="680.52" dur="8.29">there&amp;#39;s no visible mark from tariffs hmm</text>
  <text start="685.73" dur="7.1">that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="688.81" dur="6.75">I mean is he not going along with the</text>
  <text start="692.83" dur="5.61">mainstream media the other central bank</text>
  <text start="695.56" dur="6.39">bad guys plan it&amp;#39;s starting to seem that</text>
  <text start="698.44" dur="5.31">way and I know the cent other central</text>
  <text start="701.95" dur="3.24">bank you know presidents are out there</text>
  <text start="703.75" dur="3.06">saying that he&amp;#39;s not going to raise</text>
