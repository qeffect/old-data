  <text start="50.129" dur="5.7">financial news now we see the central</text>
  <text start="53.129" dur="4.081">bankers the US government there can try</text>
  <text start="55.829" dur="3.961">to continually trying to keep this</text>
  <text start="57.21" dur="3.989">market alive the high-frequency traders</text>
  <text start="59.79" dur="3.63">the plunge protection team they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="61.199" dur="4.471">whatever they possibly can to keep the</text>
  <text start="63.42" dur="3.989">stock market up they want all eyes on</text>
  <text start="65.67" dur="3.96">that and they&amp;#39;re going to push this as</text>
  <text start="67.409" dur="4.651">high as they possibly can right to the</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="4.68">very end we see gold is still holding</text>

  <text start="74.31" dur="4.14">see a rise once again and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="76.74" dur="6.87">talking about how the American person</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="7.529">the 26 million people who don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="83.61" dur="4.74">full time high paying job how they just</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="4.651">can&amp;#39;t go out and they just can&amp;#39;t shop</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="4.26">right now because they have two three</text>
  <text start="90.63" dur="4.439">maybe four part-time jobs and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="92.61" dur="5.7">not making anywhere what they made</text>
  <text start="95.069" dur="4.68">before and this is a problem now of</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="2.309">course the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="99.749" dur="3.33">are trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="100.619" dur="5.04">unemployment is fantastic yes it creeped</text>
  <text start="103.079" dur="6.78">up to four point nine percent but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="6.27">almost there at full employment well we</text>
  <text start="109.859" dur="4.351">know retail is contracting at this point</text>
  <text start="111.929" dur="5.521">and we talked about the restaurant</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="6.63">Performance Index once before and we</text>
  <text start="117.45" dur="5.909">realize that restaurants aren&amp;#39;t doing as</text>
  <text start="120.84" dur="4.729">well either because what happens as more</text>
  <text start="123.359" dur="5.46">and more people lose their jobs and</text>
  <text start="125.569" dur="6.431">either they can&amp;#39;t find one or they have</text>
  <text start="128.819" dur="5.431">to get to three part-time jobs they cut</text>
  <text start="132" dur="5.4">out restaurants too takes a little bit</text>
  <text start="134.25" dur="5.19">longer to show up but we are seeing it</text>
  <text start="137.4" dur="3.78">now the National Restaurant</text>
  <text start="139.44" dur="5.78">Association&amp;#39;s restaurant performance</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="8.34">index shows a troubling picture</text>
  <text start="145.22" dur="6.52">restaurant sales softened in May along</text>
  <text start="149.52" dur="6.12">with operator expectations as the</text>
  <text start="151.74" dur="6.329">industry continued its choppy 2016 the</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="4.88">monthly indication of the health of the</text>
  <text start="158.069" dur="6">industry fell by point nine percent to</text>
  <text start="160.52" dur="7.439">100.6 in May from 10 1.6 in</text>
  <text start="164.069" dur="9.361">April so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="167.959" dur="7.95">traffic is falling the latest data which</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="4.679">is coming from bank of america is</text>
  <text start="175.909" dur="4.75">disturbing because unlike the government</text>
  <text start="178.109" dur="5.16">data even the nra s and that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="180.659" dur="7.651">National Rifle Association that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="183.269" dur="10.491">National Restaurant Association what</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="9.06">we&amp;#39;re seeing is the government data and</text>
  <text start="193.76" dur="7.39">bank of america well they&amp;#39;re showing two</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="6.329">different things and what bank of</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="6">america data is showing is that sales</text>
  <text start="203.699" dur="6.9">and guest counts in june they have been</text>
  <text start="207.15" dur="7.289">tumbling to new multi-year lows in fact</text>
  <text start="210.599" dur="7.89">as of jun the number of guest counts was</text>
  <text start="214.439" dur="6">the worst since februari of 2013 sales</text>
  <text start="218.489" dur="5.041">and guest counts in june set multi-year</text>
  <text start="220.439" dur="8.101">lows and they were down by five point</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="7.319">nine percent on a two-year basis so what</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="5.219">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now this is spreading</text>
  <text start="230.849" dur="5.401">and it&amp;#39;s spreading to the restaurants we</text>
  <text start="233.759" dur="4.44">already know it&amp;#39;s in retail because we</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="4.68">see stores closing we see it contracting</text>
  <text start="238.199" dur="4.921">we see people being laid off but of</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="3.779">course we have the US government central</text>
  <text start="243.12" dur="4.049">bankers out there trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="3.81">that everything is just fine look at our</text>
  <text start="247.169" dur="4.111">unemployment numbers look at the stock</text>
  <text start="248.519" dur="6.981">markets or after the jobs report comes</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="6.449">out but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="4.959">this is coming from the feds labor</text>
  <text start="257.729" dur="5.821">market condition index this has tumbled</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="6.631">for six straight months it tumbled to</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="9.299">1.9 percent in June worse than expected</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="9.44">and it&amp;#39;s not getting better so when we</text>
  <text start="272.849" dur="8.221">look at the job numbers we know that in</text>
  <text start="276.53" dur="6.129">June the US roared back and it gained</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="6.48">two hundred and eighty seven thousand</text>
  <text start="282.659" dur="9.121">new jobs but if we look past all of that</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="5.429">past what the BLS is telling us we see</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="2.43">something completely different because</text>
  <text start="292.979" dur="5.301">when we look at the treasury tax</text>
  <text start="294.21" dur="9.39">collection data we see that the</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="7.62">economy is not doing as well as the</text>
  <text start="303.6" dur="5.79">government would like us to think</text>
  <text start="305.9" dur="5.02">corporate tax collections of 224 billion</text>
  <text start="309.39" dur="5.61">over the lat over the last nine months</text>
  <text start="310.92" dur="6.09">they were down 30 2 billion or twelve</text>
  <text start="315" dur="5.31">point five percent from the previous</text>
  <text start="317.01" dur="6.48">year so those don&amp;#39;t fit any type of</text>
  <text start="320.31" dur="6.09">rebound narrative the tell the tax</text>
  <text start="323.49" dur="4.8">collection numbers for June are nothing</text>
  <text start="326.4" dur="4.2">short of a disaster withholding tax</text>
  <text start="328.29" dur="4.89">collections hit the flat line in June</text>
  <text start="330.6" dur="6.36">coming in at 180 point six billion</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="7.35">compared to 180 billion last June that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.96" dur="7.14">not a roaring job market that&amp;#39;s a point</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="6.09">three percent rounding error non</text>
  <text start="344.1" dur="4.65">withheld taxes in June which reflect</text>
  <text start="346.62" dur="3.57">bonuses estimated payments for</text>
  <text start="348.75" dur="3.63">anticipated earnings dropped from</text>
  <text start="350.19" dur="6.57">seventy six point seven billion last</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="8.31">year 260 2.3 billion this year that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="356.76" dur="6.42">19-percent plungin plunge and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="360.69" dur="4.65">a rounding error corporate tax</text>
  <text start="363.18" dur="4.44">collections in June dropped from seventy</text>
  <text start="365.34" dur="7.31">four point nine billion last year 260</text>
  <text start="367.62" dur="8.34">2.8 billion this year 16.2 percent drop</text>
  <text start="372.65" dur="7.39">so when we look at this this tells us</text>
  <text start="375.96" dur="7.05">and these are the facts that the economy</text>
  <text start="380.04" dur="6.9">is not doing what the government is</text>
  <text start="383.01" dur="6.5">telling us it is doing the job numbers</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="6.479">that they&amp;#39;re continually telling us are</text>
  <text start="389.51" dur="8.62">incredible they&amp;#39;re not remember how they</text>
  <text start="393.419" dur="7.861">calculate them one two three part-time</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="5.22">jobs that&amp;#39;s counted as one two three</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="5.76">full-time jobs those people who aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="403.35" dur="6.69">looking but still want a job but having</text>
  <text start="407.04" dur="6.03">been on an interview they just not</text>
  <text start="410.04" dur="5.43">counted they still want a job but guess</text>
  <text start="413.07" dur="5.4">what we don&amp;#39;t think they want it just</text>
  <text start="415.47" dur="4.38">like the government tells us that people</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="2.46">just don&amp;#39;t want to shop now no they</text>
  <text start="419.85" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t want to shop now because they</text>
  <text start="420.93" dur="5.549">don&amp;#39;t have the money and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="6.3">looking at all of these facts over this</text>
  <text start="426.479" dur="4.621">entire time each time the government</text>
  <text start="429.51" dur="4.65">comes out or the Fed</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="6.27">comes out with something we look through</text>
  <text start="434.16" dur="5.31">the propaganda and we go to the heart of</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="5.82">the matter things they really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="439.47" dur="6.09">manipulate and this is a problem because</text>
  <text start="443.19" dur="7.16">as we look at this we can see that the</text>
  <text start="445.56" dur="9.05">economy the job numbers GDP retail</text>
  <text start="450.35" dur="7.09">manufacturing it is not doing what</text>
  <text start="454.61" dur="5.53">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us of it is</text>
  <text start="457.44" dur="5.4">not recovering there is no rebound</text>
  <text start="460.14" dur="5.91">actually everything&amp;#39;s going in the</text>
  <text start="462.84" dur="6.96">opposite direction when we look at the</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="5.49">st. Louis Fed the st. Louis Fed is</text>
  <text start="469.8" dur="4.68">showing us that we&amp;#39;re drifting back into</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="7.94">yet another banking crisis we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="11.1">yield curves well they&amp;#39;re looking like</text>
  <text start="479.48" dur="9.04">2007 when we look at credit quality we</text>
  <text start="485.58" dur="5.81">see we&amp;#39;re heading back to 2007 we look</text>
  <text start="488.52" dur="7.35">at delinquencies on all loans and leases</text>
  <text start="491.39" dur="8.86">we have a major problem just like 2007</text>
  <text start="495.87" dur="7.95">going into 2008 so when we look at this</text>
  <text start="500.25" dur="6.84">we see that we&amp;#39;re in heading in the same</text>
  <text start="503.82" dur="6.93">exact direction it&amp;#39;s not getting better</text>
  <text start="507.09" dur="6.449">it&amp;#39;s getting worse now we know Bernanke</text>
  <text start="510.75" dur="5.729">went out to Japan meeting with Kuroda</text>
  <text start="513.539" dur="4.801">meeting with aa bay and we knew they</text>
  <text start="516.479" dur="6.411">were going to dosometing with helicopter</text>
  <text start="518.34" dur="8.67">money well it looks like they started</text>
  <text start="522.89" dur="6.82">because overnight we see there was the</text>
  <text start="527.01" dur="7.04">first light instance of helicopter money</text>
  <text start="529.71" dur="6.99">and what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="534.05" dur="5.62">they&amp;#39;re using a hundred billion fiscal</text>
  <text start="536.7" dur="4.38">expansion coming out of Japan it comes</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="4.29">in conjunction with an imminent</text>
  <text start="541.08" dur="5.13">expansion of even more monetary stimulus</text>
  <text start="543.96" dur="4.29">the Bank of Japan is set to announce an</text>
  <text start="546.21" dur="4.53">expansion of its monthly bond and equity</text>
  <text start="548.25" dur="4.41">purchase on july twenty ninth and ebay</text>
  <text start="550.74" dur="5.85">will probably introduce fiscal stimulus</text>
  <text start="552.66" dur="6.33">by year-end so is this the start of</text>
  <text start="556.59" dur="4.68">helicopter moment a helicopter money yes</text>
  <text start="558.99" dur="3.54">it appears so now what the central</text>
  <text start="561.27" dur="2.46">bankers look like what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="562.53" dur="5.15">right now</text>
  <text start="563.73" dur="7.52">is there using Japan as a trial balloon</text>
  <text start="567.68" dur="6.159">for the rest of the world if it works</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="8.079">guess what we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="573.839" dur="7.081">spread to other countries now we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="579.329" dur="3.841">this before with the beylin documents</text>
  <text start="580.92" dur="5.46">they use Cyprus did it work that people</text>
  <text start="583.17" dur="5.58">complain were they able to take the</text>
  <text start="586.38" dur="4.769">money from the people yes they were and</text>
  <text start="588.75" dur="4.519">then all of a sudden we saw Europe get</text>
  <text start="591.149" dur="8.641">bail in documents Canada New Zealand</text>
  <text start="593.269" dur="10.391">United States UK now everyone set up for</text>
  <text start="599.79" dur="6.75">balance and we can see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="603.66" dur="6.51">doing is they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for</text>
  <text start="606.54" dur="6.539">this system to come down and the central</text>
  <text start="610.17" dur="5.789">bankers they&amp;#39;re using whatever they have</text>
  <text start="613.079" dur="5.12">left to keep this system operational</text>
  <text start="615.959" dur="5.401">until they can get this war started</text>
  <text start="618.199" dur="5.621">David Cameron he acknowledged that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.36" dur="4.14">going to resign on Wednesday looks like</text>
  <text start="623.82" dur="4.999">Theresa May will be the next prime</text>
  <text start="625.5" dur="8.49">minister and she might have the task of</text>
  <text start="628.819" dur="8.981">triggering article 50 but there might be</text>
  <text start="633.99" dur="6.45">a problem because there&amp;#39;s more than a</text>
  <text start="637.8" dur="4.44">thousand prominent British lawyers that</text>
  <text start="640.44" dur="3.06">have signed a letter urging Prime</text>
  <text start="642.24" dur="3.45">Minister David Cameron to allow</text>
  <text start="643.5" dur="4.139">Parliament to decide whether the United</text>
  <text start="645.69" dur="5.22">Kingdom should leave the European Union</text>
  <text start="647.639" dur="6.211">and they&amp;#39;re saying that they should take</text>
  <text start="650.91" dur="4.89">away the process of triggering article</text>
  <text start="653.85" dur="4.19">50 from away from the Prime Minister and</text>
  <text start="655.8" dur="4.89">put it into the hands of parliament</text>
  <text start="658.04" dur="8.25">because what they&amp;#39;re trying to say is is</text>
  <text start="660.69" dur="8.699">that this whole brexit referendum was</text>
  <text start="666.29" dur="6.07">done on misrepresentations of fact and</text>
  <text start="669.389" dur="6.151">promises that could never be delivered</text>
  <text start="672.36" dur="5.039">and there must be a free vote in</text>
  <text start="675.54" dur="4.14">parliament before the normal EU divorce</text>
  <text start="677.399" dur="5.721">procedure is triggering is triggered by</text>
  <text start="679.68" dur="6.149">invoking article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty</text>
  <text start="683.12" dur="7.149">so they&amp;#39;re already making preparations</text>
  <text start="685.829" dur="6.601">to try to stop this now I believe what</text>
  <text start="690.269" dur="4.711">this whole process was was to let air</text>
  <text start="692.43" dur="5.07">out of the bubble allow the central</text>
  <text start="694.98" dur="4.14">banks to do things they</text>
  <text start="697.5" dur="3.78">normally wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do without</text>
  <text start="699.12" dur="4.53">having some type of incredible</text>
  <text start="701.28" dur="4.56">explanation instead they can just say</text>
  <text start="703.65" dur="4.64">brexit that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re bailing out</text>
  <text start="705.84" dur="5.16">these banks brexit this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="708.29" dur="4.27">creating more currency brexit this is</text>
  <text start="711" dur="5.25">why we&amp;#39;re trying helicopter money and</text>
  <text start="712.56" dur="7.05">they&amp;#39;re using all of this right now to</text>
  <text start="716.25" dur="6.12">keep this system alive we see the IMF is</text>
  <text start="719.61" dur="4.8">cutting the 2016 growth down to one</text>
  <text start="722.37" dur="5.1">point six percent because of the brexit</text>
  <text start="724.41" dur="4.59">and they&amp;#39;re already saying in 2017 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="727.47" dur="5.07">going to be one point four percent or</text>
  <text start="729" dur="5.34">lower for Europe and we can see already</text>
