  <text start="96.26" dur="6.3">this I mean really let&amp;#39;s think about it</text>
  <text start="98.89" dur="6.25">we retail stores are closing all over</text>

  <text start="127.1" dur="6.27">just came out and their sales have</text>
  <text start="130.31" dur="5.91">plummeted so I mean from everything that</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="4.02">we see why would the confidence of the</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="2.7">people be</text>
  <text start="137.39" dur="2.76">the highest point it of course it</text>
  <text start="138.92" dur="4.62">wouldn&amp;#39;t would be at the lowest point</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="6.39">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="4.65">because everyone knows and feels it that</text>
  <text start="146.54" dur="5.01">there is something wrong with the</text>
  <text start="148.19" dur="6.63">economy something is not right if you go</text>
  <text start="151.55" dur="6.75">and you can&amp;#39;t find a job something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.82" dur="9.389">wrong I mean I remember back you know</text>
  <text start="158.3" dur="10.23">from 2002-2006 jobs were easy to get I</text>
  <text start="164.209" dur="6.691">mean you there were so many jobs oh you</text>
  <text start="168.53" dur="7.26">know people hiring like crazy it was</text>
  <text start="170.9" dur="6.86">ridiculous now it&amp;#39;s very very few yes if</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="4.229">you go to New York and Wall Street</text>
  <text start="177.76" dur="4.93">they&amp;#39;re all hiring because they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="180.019" dur="4.5">ones getting the money but if you go</text>
  <text start="182.69" dur="5.46">anywhere else in the country it is much</text>
  <text start="184.519" dur="6.541">more difficult to find a job so how</text>
  <text start="188.15" dur="7.23">could people you know be happy and ready</text>
  <text start="191.06" dur="7.53">to spend their people are not what else</text>
  <text start="195.38" dur="6.63">we see in the news the comics physical</text>
  <text start="198.59" dur="7.26">gold plummets gold is disappearing from</text>
  <text start="202.01" dur="6.81">depositories everywhere and this came</text>
  <text start="205.85" dur="4.83">out and you know they they try to do the</text>
  <text start="208.82" dur="6.919">push down of gold of around two hundred</text>
  <text start="210.68" dur="7.83">dollars and it caused a panic buying and</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="9.491">physical gold owners and silver owners</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="9.33">went out and started to buy and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="4.65">seeing shortages and premiums on the</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="6.11">physical and the physical is winning out</text>
  <text start="229.88" dur="7.74">actually physical has been going up now</text>
  <text start="233.95" dur="8.23">since that smackdown so gold and silver</text>
  <text start="237.62" dur="7.14">have been rising again and I me right</text>
  <text start="242.18" dur="6.93">now they are going to probably try to</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="6.21">keep it around the 1450 area and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="249.11" dur="3.84">see smackdowns I&amp;#39;ll go up and you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="250.97" dur="5.759">smackdowns that&amp;#39;s what I think is going</text>
  <text start="252.95" dur="5.64">to happen now in this report they say</text>
  <text start="256.729" dur="5.521">that you know the eligible stocks which</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="6">are owned in the lbma in comics good</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="3.66">delivery form are being drawn down which</text>
  <text start="264.59" dur="3.81">means they&amp;#39;re being removed from the</text>
  <text start="265.91" dur="5.25">warehouses as to how and why they are</text>
  <text start="268.4" dur="4.98">being removed that is a mystery</text>
  <text start="271.16" dur="4.77">eligible stocks were on the continual</text>
  <text start="273.38" dur="4.86">increase throughout the bull market now</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="9.09">the trend has changed so they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="278.24" dur="14.19">you know gold disappearing so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.02" dur="11.75">very strange and central banks went on</text>
  <text start="292.43" dur="8.07">the biggest spending spree in 50 years</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="8.02">when the gold prices were pushed down</text>
  <text start="300.5" dur="6.54">central banks countries investors all</text>
  <text start="304.79" dur="9.05">started buying the physical and dumping</text>
  <text start="307.04" dur="9.72">the paper we also see today that</text>
  <text start="313.84" dur="5.68">protesters are clashing with police in</text>
  <text start="316.76" dur="5.42">Spain and Portugal because they you know</text>
  <text start="319.52" dur="6.24">against their against the government</text>
  <text start="322.18" dur="6.43">cutting pay to government workers for</text>
  <text start="325.76" dur="5.91">austerity and we&amp;#39;re going to see I mean</text>
  <text start="328.61" dur="5.19">it died down and now you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.67" dur="4.53">seeing the protesters again unemployment</text>
  <text start="333.8" dur="6.32">is coming out you know in Spain and</text>
  <text start="336.2" dur="8.43">Portugal you know twenty-seven percent</text>
  <text start="340.12" dur="8.16">this is going to continually happen we</text>
  <text start="344.63" dur="6.69">are going to see more and more riots</text>
  <text start="348.28" dur="5.86">because when people aren&amp;#39;t making a</text>
  <text start="351.32" dur="4.68">living and can&amp;#39;t feed their families you</text>
  <text start="354.14" dur="5.22">will see more and more people getting</text>
  <text start="356" dur="6.5">angry and as time goes on people are</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="5.94">getting angrier just like in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="362.5" dur="5.14">people still can only take out a certain</text>
  <text start="365.3" dur="6.08">amount of money because they have</text>
  <text start="367.64" dur="6.93">capital controls in place and even with</text>
  <text start="371.38" dur="6.31">taking the people&amp;#39;s money they still do</text>
  <text start="374.57" dur="7.95">not have them enough money to to cover</text>
  <text start="377.69" dur="10.17">the entire debt so what do you think is</text>
  <text start="382.52" dur="7.26">going to happen but let&amp;#39;s move on now we</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="4.53">know the collapse is coming and we know</text>
  <text start="389.78" dur="5.07">that the central bankers and governments</text>
  <text start="392.39" dur="7.68">they&amp;#39;re scrambling because it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="394.85" dur="10.12">and things are getting crazier harder to</text>
  <text start="400.07" dur="9.819">control and they need a</text>
  <text start="404.97" dur="8.68">to blame this collapse on so we see that</text>
  <text start="409.889" dur="7.271">Syria through the propaganda of Israel</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="5.31">and America they&amp;#39;ve came out and said</text>
  <text start="417.16" dur="4.17">that sir is using chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="418.96" dur="3.81">way back President Obama said you know</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="4.53">if they cross this red line of using</text>
  <text start="422.77" dur="5.88">chemical weapons you know we we will go</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="5.64">to war and of course you know the Senate</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="6.03">resolution number 65 was passed that we</text>
  <text start="431.5" dur="5.37">will go to war with Israel to fight Iran</text>
  <text start="434.68" dur="4.799">so you can see where this is leading</text>
  <text start="436.87" dur="7.28">because we have North Korea with their</text>
  <text start="439.479" dur="11.12">nuclear threats which is the you know us</text>
  <text start="444.15" dur="8.829">pushing them the u.s. is propagandizing</text>
  <text start="450.599" dur="3.79">the chemical weapons because you know</text>
  <text start="452.979" dur="3.211">chemical weapons weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="454.389" dur="4.681">destruction but we&amp;#39;ve heard this before</text>
  <text start="456.19" dur="4.62">Iraq had weapons of mass destruction but</text>
  <text start="459.07" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;ve never seen them they didn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="460.81" dur="10.56">they just wanted to get us into war</text>
  <text start="463.66" dur="9.27">that&amp;#39;s what this is about and how are</text>
  <text start="471.37" dur="5.1">they going to get us into war because if</text>
  <text start="472.93" dur="5.28">you think about it just by saying they</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="4.59">have chemical weapons I&amp;#39;m not ready to</text>
  <text start="478.21" dur="6.929">go to war I need proof and why are we</text>
  <text start="481.06" dur="6.78">there why are we in Syria it&amp;#39;s so far</text>
  <text start="485.139" dur="4.951">away that most Americans right now are</text>
  <text start="487.84" dur="4.079">sleeping they don&amp;#39;t even care about</text>
  <text start="490.09" dur="4.98">Syria they don&amp;#39;t even care about</text>
  <text start="491.919" dur="8.041">chemical weapons what are they going to</text>
  <text start="495.07" dur="9.379">do to wake people up to care that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="9.15">whole thing and we know that the NYPD is</text>
  <text start="504.449" dur="7.71">having a drill this summer that has to</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="6.33">do with chemical chemical weapon</text>
  <text start="512.159" dur="6.851">disbursement in the subway systems very</text>
  <text start="515.44" dur="9.87">interesting we also know about the</text>
  <text start="519.01" dur="7.8">gunman in a nuclear plant so I mean we</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="9.11">can just see where all of this is</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="7.61">heading now in California they are</text>
  <text start="535.02" dur="11.73">trying to pass a bill that will allow</text>
  <text start="541.98" dur="7.07">them to do gun confiscation which is</text>
  <text start="546.75" dur="5.16">completely against the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="549.05" dur="5.55">so whatever law they come out with is</text>
  <text start="551.91" dur="8.55">null and void but what&amp;#39;s scary is is</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="11.83">that what they said they are allowed to</text>
  <text start="560.46" dur="8.06">do and it just makes you really think so</text>
  <text start="566.43" dur="4.59">what this is what&amp;#39;s so crazy about it</text>
  <text start="568.52" dur="4.96">California is the only u.s. state where</text>
  <text start="571.02" dur="4.8">law enforcement officials confiscate</text>
  <text start="573.48" dur="4.92">guns from the homes of individuals not</text>
  <text start="575.82" dur="5.7">legally permitted to own them because</text>
  <text start="578.4" dur="5.37">gun composition agents do not obtained</text>
  <text start="581.52" dur="4.11">search warrants their job involves</text>
  <text start="583.77" dur="4.65">convincing people to let them into their</text>
  <text start="585.63" dur="5.94">homes and hand over their guns if an</text>
  <text start="588.42" dur="5.19">individual does turn over a gun he or</text>
  <text start="591.57" dur="6.77">she can be arrested on suspicion of</text>
  <text start="593.61" dur="9.89">illegally owning a firearm so how many</text>
  <text start="598.34" dur="7.95">amendments does this break I mean really</text>
  <text start="603.5" dur="5.92">the fourth amend the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="606.29" dur="4.39">you know there&amp;#39;s the the right of the</text>
  <text start="609.42" dur="5.46">people to be secure in their persons</text>
  <text start="610.68" dur="5.79">houses papers and effects against</text>
  <text start="614.88" dur="3.69">unreasonable searches and seizures shall</text>
  <text start="616.47" dur="4.92">not be violated I mean they need a</text>
  <text start="618.57" dur="6.93">warrant to go in there but again when</text>
  <text start="621.39" dur="9.78">you see a government misusing their</text>
  <text start="625.5" dur="8.76">powers and making up their own laws to</text>
  <text start="631.17" dur="7.98">back whatever agenda they have you know</text>
  <text start="634.26" dur="7.5">we&amp;#39;re coming close to a collapse when</text>
  <text start="639.15" dur="6.6">they start disregarding the Constitution</text>
  <text start="641.76" dur="7.14">completely and we see from mayor&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="645.75" dur="5.24">lawmakers to government officials who</text>
  <text start="648.9" dur="5.61">want to do away with the Constitution</text>
  <text start="650.99" dur="7.38">you know we are getting close we are</text>
  <text start="654.51" dur="8.64">seeing more false flags we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="658.37" dur="8.86">their agenda by labeling certain groups</text>
  <text start="663.15" dur="5.23">in America and this is the tipping point</text>
  <text start="667.23" dur="3.13">and</text>
  <text start="668.38" dur="5.88">everything is coming together and you</text>
  <text start="670.36" dur="7.44">can see it all happening if you&amp;#39;re awake</text>
  <text start="674.26" dur="5.61">if you&amp;#39;re not awake you see absolutely</text>
  <text start="677.8" dur="4.05">nothing until it&amp;#39;s too late and people</text>

  <text start="1191.809" dur="6.63">true and the only reason I&amp;#39;m telling</text>
  <text start="1195.319" dur="5.55">everyone this is because if I told you</text>
  <text start="1198.439" dur="12.8">and we have to think back if i told you</text>
  <text start="1200.869" dur="10.37">in august of two thousand and one that I</text>
  <text start="1211.929" dur="3.82">there was a report out there that planes</text>
  <text start="1214.519" dur="4.07">are going to fly into the world trade</text>
  <text start="1215.749" dur="7.44">center and the world trade centers are</text>
  <text start="1218.589" dur="6.49">going to be demolished by terrorists you</text>
  <text start="1223.189" dur="5.51">would think I was crazy you think like</text>
  <text start="1225.079" dur="6.12">no that can&amp;#39;t pay that wouldn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="1228.699" dur="9.46">but if I told you that in August and it</text>
  <text start="1231.199" dur="10.76">did happen you might think otherwise so</text>
  <text start="1238.159" dur="6.36">this is what this person is saying and</text>
  <text start="1241.959" dur="4.69">again this is just a warning it might</text>
  <text start="1244.519" dur="4.62">not happen but it&amp;#39;s always nice to be</text>
  <text start="1246.649" dur="5.13">informed to know what other people are</text>
  <text start="1249.139" dur="7.32">saying and it it could be true it might</text>
  <text start="1251.779" dur="6.3">not be true so he goes on to say I have</text>
  <text start="1256.459" dur="3.81">not been able to stop listening to my</text>
  <text start="1258.079" dur="5.94">navel seal contact over the past few</text>
  <text start="1260.269" dur="6.81">days he&amp;#39;s a walking encyclopedia of</text>
  <text start="1264.019" dur="4.77">information of this kind of subject he</text>
  <text start="1267.079" dur="4.29">admitted to me that he feels the need to</text>
  <text start="1268.789" dur="5.07">tell America the truth at last about</text>
  <text start="1271.369" dur="6.57">these things and feels the urgency to go</text>
  <text start="1273.859" dur="6.99">public ASAP last night my seal source</text>
  <text start="1277.939" dur="4.98">told me that he estimates there were</text>
  <text start="1280.849" dur="4.83">around a hundred of these planted</text>
  <text start="1282.919" dur="4.86">explosives across the nation this is his</text>
  <text start="1285.679" dur="4.41">personal estimation and may not be the</text>
  <text start="1287.779" dur="5.07">actual number but then who can ever know</text>
  <text start="1290.089" dur="5.4">the exact number but the insider</text>
  <text start="1292.849" dur="4.83">planners I just spoke personally with a</text>
  <text start="1295.489" dur="5.97">military insider enables a Navy SEAL</text>
  <text start="1297.679" dur="6.42">sniper with a record 200 hits who told</text>
  <text start="1301.459" dur="4.29">me some horrifying information yes I</text>
  <text start="1304.099" dur="3.66">know it&amp;#39;s full name which I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1305.749" dur="4.23">allowed to make known publicly at this</text>
  <text start="1307.759" dur="4.88">time yes I also know the name of the</text>
  <text start="1309.979" dur="5.701">military contact of his in Washington DC</text>
  <text start="1312.639" dur="5.741">this Navy SEAL recently helped</text>
  <text start="1315.68" dur="6.86">with other military men nukes that were</text>
  <text start="1318.38" dur="7.53">not planted by NW n wo forces and</text>
  <text start="1322.54" dur="9.73">destined to go off around May 5th to</text>
  <text start="1325.91" dur="9.18">trigger martial law nationwide and he</text>
  <text start="1332.27" dur="5.49">did this in mint in Montana and there</text>
  <text start="1335.09" dur="5.64">are more across the nation the urgency</text>
  <text start="1337.76" dur="4.62">of this message is these rogue nukes he</text>
  <text start="1340.73" dur="5.76">helped to intercept were set to detonate</text>
  <text start="1342.38" dur="6.33">around May 6 2013 and while he and his</text>
  <text start="1346.49" dur="4.85">men may have intercepted and stopped</text>
  <text start="1348.71" dur="5.49">these particular ones he told me about</text>
  <text start="1351.34" dur="5.92">there are more rogue nukes out there and</text>
  <text start="1354.2" dur="6.17">apparently they too may be scheduled to</text>
  <text start="1357.26" dur="5.85">detonate around this time period as well</text>
  <text start="1360.37" dur="4.95">honestly we on the outside cannot</text>
  <text start="1363.11" dur="4.98">possibly know the exact plan time of</text>
  <text start="1365.32" dur="4.54">detonation of the other nukes but it</text>
  <text start="1368.09" dur="3.36">would make perfect sense that they would</text>
  <text start="1369.86" dur="4.83">follow the pattern of the previously</text>
  <text start="1371.45" dur="6.6">intercepted nukes he admitted to me that</text>
  <text start="1374.69" dur="5.97">we are talking about tens of thousands</text>
  <text start="1378.05" dur="5.25">of innocent lives taken out or affected</text>
  <text start="1380.66" dur="6.42">by every single one of these deadly Road</text>
  <text start="1383.3" dur="6.45">nuclear devices and he goes on to say</text>
  <text start="1387.08" dur="5.55">that he realizes that if operation ring</text>
  <text start="1389.75" dur="6.51">of fire nukes are detonated across the</text>
  <text start="1392.63" dur="6.54">station it will lead to ero irrevocable</text>
  <text start="1396.26" dur="6.45">martial law which is exactly what they</text>
  <text start="1399.17" dur="5.22">planned now again this might be true it</text>
  <text start="1402.71" dur="4.26">might not be true like I said if I told</text>
  <text start="1404.39" dur="3.99">you about the World Trade Center before</text>
  <text start="1406.97" dur="5.91">it happened you would think I&amp;#39;m crazy</text>
  <text start="1408.38" dur="7.95">and we are seeing in his report he also</text>
  <text start="1412.88" dur="5.73">stated that he sees massive troop</text>
  <text start="1416.33" dur="5.16">movements which we have been seeing</text>
  <text start="1418.61" dur="9.23">troop movements in Seattle and other</text>
  <text start="1421.49" dur="6.35">states and we have to look at this and</text>
  <text start="1427.87" dur="7.18">understand that the Boston bombing event</text>
  <text start="1432.25" dur="5.5">didn&amp;#39;t go as planned so they need</text>
  <text start="1435.05" dur="5.01">something and they also need something</text>
  <text start="1437.75" dur="5.7">to get us into war now I&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="1440.06" dur="5.76">cyber attack this is a nuclear type of</text>
  <text start="1443.45" dur="4.95">attack it might be used to get us into</text>
  <text start="1445.82" dur="3.84">martial law it might be another push for</text>
  <text start="1448.4" dur="2.88">them to get into</text>
  <text start="1449.66" dur="3.21">or to see if it happens and if it does</text>
  <text start="1451.28" dur="5.28">if it doesn&amp;#39;t they might have to do</text>
  <text start="1452.87" dur="7.56">something else but again the events are</text>
  <text start="1456.56" dur="12">to get the American people to wake up to</text>
  <text start="1460.43" dur="10.49">anger them to push us into war now they</text>
  <text start="1468.56" dur="5.67">might explode maybe one or two of these</text>
  <text start="1470.92" dur="5.59">see how people react then explode a</text>
  <text start="1474.23" dur="4.41">couple more they might blame it on other</text>
  <text start="1476.51" dur="6.63">people in the country so they have to</text>
  <text start="1478.64" dur="8.34">declare martial law we don&amp;#39;t know but we</text>
  <text start="1483.14" dur="8.31">need to understand that things are in</text>
  <text start="1486.98" dur="7.41">motion the plan has been set and the</text>
