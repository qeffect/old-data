  <text start="118.509" dur="5.131">something very interesting now couple</text>
  <text start="120.97" dur="4.649">reports ago we talked about how Google</text>
  <text start="123.64" dur="5.33">Facebook Twitter YouTube and the big</text>
  <text start="125.619" dur="6.381">social media platforms they have been</text>
  <text start="128.97" dur="6.129">censoring individuals now the FCC</text>
  <text start="132" dur="5.14">actually took a look at this and in</text>
  <text start="135.099" dur="5.191">their factsheet on net neutrality reform</text>
  <text start="137.14" dur="5.73">the FCC notes that recent evidence</text>
  <text start="140.29" dur="4.949">suggests that hosting services social</text>
  <text start="142.87" dur="4.17">media platforms edge providers and other</text>
  <text start="145.239" dur="4.231">providers of virtual Internet</text>
  <text start="147.04" dur="6.57">infrastructure are more likely to block</text>
  <text start="149.47" dur="7.41">content on viewpoint grounds and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="153.61" dur="6.06">saying that services like the ISP</text>
  <text start="156.88" dur="7.17">providers well they&amp;#39;re less likely to</text>
  <text start="159.67" dur="7.5">block anything and when you look at</text>
  <text start="164.05" dur="5.34">their footnotes the FCC cites a number</text>
  <text start="167.17" dur="5.069">of incidents in which major tech</text>
  <text start="169.39" dur="5.13">companies blocked lawful content</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="4.561">including the effective removal of the</text>

  <text start="183.88" dur="3.34">content and they&amp;#39;re saying yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="185.65" dur="4.42">these social media sites</text>
  <text start="187.22" dur="5.61">were all for net neutrality and it</text>
  <text start="190.07" dur="3.53">wasn&amp;#39;t the ISP providers because once</text>
  <text start="192.83" dur="3.48">again</text>
  <text start="193.6" dur="5.17">how are the ISP providers really gonna</text>
  <text start="196.31" dur="5.19">get involved with other people&amp;#39;s sites</text>
  <text start="198.77" dur="4.92">they really don&amp;#39;t have that power yes</text>
  <text start="201.5" dur="4.68">they could try to do it but people would</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="3.96">say okay why are you doing this how do</text>
  <text start="206.18" dur="3.18">you have the right to do this if you</text>
  <text start="207.65" dur="3.72">look at YouTube or if you look at</text>
  <text start="209.36" dur="3.3">Facebook well this is our site we could</text>

  <text start="319.91" dur="2.52">make their system more</text>
  <text start="321.08" dur="3.57">and this is what&amp;#39;s been happening for a</text>
  <text start="322.43" dur="4.68">very long time we see right now that</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="5.729">Iraq is going to be building a new oil</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="4.799">pipeline from Kirkuk to Turkey and it</text>
  <text start="330.379" dur="4.141">looks like this pipeline most likely is</text>
  <text start="331.909" dur="5.701">gonna be coming in from a ram and we see</text>
  <text start="334.52" dur="5.579">right now that this is exactly what the</text>
  <text start="337.61" dur="4.41">Cabal didn&amp;#39;t want from the beginning and</text>
  <text start="340.099" dur="4.021">they tried to stop it and looks like</text>
  <text start="342.02" dur="5.04">what is happening right now the Cabal</text>
  <text start="344.12" dur="5.639">they are losing and it nothing is going</text>
  <text start="347.06" dur="4.05">their way we see the Syrian army they</text>
  <text start="349.759" dur="4.081">have confiscated the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="4.769">weapons and what they found out is that</text>
  <text start="353.84" dur="4.859">a lot of the weapons were made by NATO</text>
  <text start="355.879" dur="5.491">and they originated from the US Europe</text>
  <text start="358.699" dur="5.19">Israel and they have all these weapons</text>
  <text start="361.37" dur="3.93">right now and as they&amp;#39;re taking over</text>
  <text start="363.889" dur="3.18">more and more of these little villages</text>
  <text start="365.3" dur="3.959">where they have these caches of weapons</text>
  <text start="367.069" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re starting to realize that most of</text>
  <text start="369.259" dur="4.65">the weapons the most of the technology</text>
  <text start="370.699" dur="5.071">that they have all came from NATO Israel</text>
  <text start="373.909" dur="4.861">the United States the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="375.77" dur="5.82">which again was supporting and supplying</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="4.799">the Islamic state and we know right now</text>
  <text start="381.59" dur="4.59">because we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on it that</text>
  <text start="383.569" dur="4.861">the United States the Cabal had a lot</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="4.56">more troops inside of Syria and Iraq</text>
  <text start="388.43" dur="4.62">then then then the corporate media was</text>
  <text start="390.74" dur="5.789">reporting we talked about this way way</text>
  <text start="393.05" dur="6.959">back where again with Iraq they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="396.529" dur="6">count the temporary troops because</text>
  <text start="400.009" dur="3.75">basically those weren&amp;#39;t the permanent</text>
  <text start="402.529" dur="2.79">troops so they only counted the</text>
  <text start="403.759" dur="4.261">agreement that they had with Iraq and</text>
  <text start="405.319" dur="5.16">said ok there&amp;#39;s only 4500 or 5,000</text>
  <text start="408.02" dur="4.29">troops in Iraq the rest we don&amp;#39;t count</text>
  <text start="410.479" dur="4.53">because they&amp;#39;re temporary but they had</text>
  <text start="412.31" dur="6.06">an open-ended expiration date they also</text>
  <text start="415.009" dur="5.701">didn&amp;#39;t count be contractors that were</text>
  <text start="418.37" dur="5.789">there that were hired by the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="420.71" dur="6.449">and now the truth is coming out and they</text>
  <text start="424.159" dur="4.531">are saying that yeah out in Syria</text>
  <text start="427.159" dur="4.23">remember the troops we had about 500</text>
  <text start="428.69" dur="7.439">well that was kind of a lie right now</text>
  <text start="431.389" dur="7.051">our our calculation on how many troops</text>
  <text start="436.129" dur="4.771">out there are around 2000 and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="438.44" dur="5.699">say that 2000 number is going to be</text>
  <text start="440.9" dur="5.819">closer to about 6 or 7 thousand because</text>
  <text start="444.139" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re not counting temporary troops</text>
  <text start="446.719" dur="4.44">and they&amp;#39;re not counting the contractors</text>
  <text start="449.419" dur="3.511">that were out there and what was</text>
  <text start="451.159" dur="3.871">happening is all the troops that were</text>
  <text start="452.93" dur="5.39">going into Iraq they were being safe</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="6.48">into Syria to protect and hold the</text>
  <text start="458.32" dur="5.02">Kurdish regions and to try to separate</text>
  <text start="461.51" dur="4.17">this and support the Kurdish troops</text>
  <text start="463.34" dur="5.64">remember the United States was funding</text>
  <text start="465.68" dur="6.72">the Kurdish army this is coming to an</text>
  <text start="468.98" dur="5.52">end the United States most likely from</text>
  <text start="472.4" dur="4.98">what Trump has been saying to her Diwan</text>
  <text start="474.5" dur="5.76">and to Putin that we&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="477.38" dur="4.71">supporting the YPG any more no longer</text>
  <text start="480.26" dur="3.96">are we going to be supporting the Kurds</text>
  <text start="482.09" dur="3.65">we&amp;#39;re not paying for the Kurds we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="4.8">supporting the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="485.74" dur="5.74">everything the Cabal wanted everything</text>
  <text start="489.02" dur="5.13">that they tried to do is coming to an</text>
  <text start="491.48" dur="5.07">end and we can see that time is running</text>
  <text start="494.15" dur="4.86">out time is ticking down and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.55" dur="3.84">gonna be pushing for another event if</text>
  <text start="499.01" dur="3.48">they can get it off the ground and</text>
  <text start="500.39" dur="4.74">what&amp;#39;s going to happen as we can see</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="4.95">that the truth between the uranium one</text>
  <text start="505.13" dur="5.16">deal all these sex scandals and</text>
  <text start="507.44" dur="4.08">everything else all of this is coming</text>
  <text start="510.29" dur="2.97">out and as more and more of this</text>
  <text start="511.52" dur="4.11">information comes out about how many</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="3.81">soldiers we have in these countries and</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="4.08">what was trauma what was trying to be</text>
  <text start="517.07" dur="4.98">done there the truth is going to crush</text>
  <text start="519.71" dur="4.83">the Cabal and we see it has already</text>
  <text start="522.05" dur="4.62">started it&amp;#39;s continuing the system is</text>
  <text start="524.54" dur="5.43">breaking down we see the central bankers</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="4.41">already preparing for the new system and</text>
  <text start="529.97" dur="2.88">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for a very long</text>
  <text start="531.08" dur="3.87">time so you need to be ready and</text>
  <text start="532.85" dur="4.65">prepared because the new system is on</text>
  <text start="534.95" dur="6.06">its way and they&amp;#39;re gonna push the new</text>
  <text start="537.5" dur="5.64">system and most likely to get us to the</text>
  <text start="541.01" dur="4.17">new system they are going to try to push</text>
  <text start="543.14" dur="4.56">for some type of an event to distract</text>
  <text start="545.18" dur="5.85">everyone and after the distraction is</text>
  <text start="547.7" dur="6.09">over say we have a new system and we can</text>
  <text start="551.03" dur="5.309">bring this new system online we have no</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="4.29">problem here&amp;#39;s the new value of gold we</text>
  <text start="556.339" dur="4.321">have the currency all ready to go and</text>
  <text start="558.08" dur="5.37">you can borrow from the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.66" dur="4.74">this is what they do and the people at</text>
  <text start="563.45" dur="4.86">this point need to stand up and say you</text>
  <text start="565.4" dur="5.16">know something we&amp;#39;re done with this we</text>
  <text start="568.31" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t want this type of system we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="570.56" dur="3.84">want any of this we would like to go to</text>
  <text start="572.78" dur="3.63">something where the people can control</text>
  <text start="574.4" dur="4.41">the people can run it and we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="576.41" dur="4.38">this because the central banks they</text>
  <text start="578.81" dur="3.45">infiltrate the governments they make the</text>
  <text start="580.79" dur="3.24">people in government very wealthy they</text>
  <text start="582.26" dur="3.3">fund the people in government and this</text>
  <text start="584.03" dur="4.8">is why you have all of this corruption</text>
  <text start="585.56" dur="5.49">and this goes on for years and years in</text>
  <text start="588.83" dur="4.11">years it gets worse as time goes on as</text>
  <text start="591.05" dur="4.8">we can see in all these countries and</text>
  <text start="592.94" dur="5.91">again the central bank is a unelected</text>
  <text start="595.85" dur="5.43">body that is sitting there controlling</text>
  <text start="598.85" dur="4.53">the world the people didn&amp;#39;t vote for</text>
  <text start="601.28" dur="4.61">these people all they done is they</text>
  <text start="603.38" dur="4.62">created this currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="605.89" dur="4.54">funded the government&amp;#39;s put them into</text>
  <text start="608" dur="5.03">debt and then with this debt they can</text>
  <text start="610.43" dur="6.21">control them that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="613.03" dur="6.76">it&amp;#39;s time for the people to take back</text>
  <text start="616.64" dur="5.91">control of the monetary system of the</text>
  <text start="619.79" dur="7.23">government&amp;#39;s and take back control of</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="6.06">our lives this is the chance to do it we</text>
  <text start="627.02" dur="3.84">need to stop them we need to keep</text>
  <text start="628.61" dur="6.57">sending the word out there that the next</text>
  <text start="630.86" dur="6.6">event was a planned event and this was</text>
  <text start="635.18" dur="4.95">orchestrated by the central bank</text>
