  <text start="56.93" dur="5.28">discussing the bailout deal and right</text>
  <text start="59.36" dur="4.74">now we understand that this is not going</text>
  <text start="62.21" dur="4.23">to help Greece whatsoever yes it will</text>
  <text start="64.1" dur="4.02">kick the can down the street but we</text>
  <text start="66.44" dur="5.43">understand it is not going to help and</text>
  <text start="68.12" dur="6.6">right now they kind of agreed on this</text>
  <text start="71.87" dur="4.74">third austerity deal and again it is an</text>
  <text start="74.72" dur="3.87">austerity deal it&amp;#39;s putting Greece</text>
  <text start="76.61" dur="4.41">further into debt it&amp;#39;s kicking the can</text>
  <text start="78.59" dur="4.98">down the road and this is involving</text>
  <text start="81.02" dur="6.06">loans of up to about 86 billion euros</text>
  <text start="83.57" dur="7.53">and they&amp;#39;re saying well yeah we made the</text>
  <text start="87.08" dur="8.13">agreement but there&amp;#39;s still some things</text>
  <text start="91.1" dur="7.19">we need to work out and there might be</text>
  <text start="95.21" dur="5.1">two or three small little details and</text>
  <text start="98.29" dur="4.96">we&amp;#39;ll let you know we have to remember</text>
  <text start="100.31" dur="6.27">Greece needs to make a 3.2 billion euro</text>
  <text start="103.25" dur="5.78">payment come August twentieth and they</text>
  <text start="106.58" dur="5.46">owe 1.5 billion to the IMF in September</text>
  <text start="109.03" dur="5.8">so the country needs about 86 billion</text>
  <text start="112.04" dur="6.81">euros to avoid a complete collapse and</text>
  <text start="114.83" dur="6.6">the country right now is collapse it has</text>
  <text start="118.85" dur="4.71">collapsed and hold they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="121.43" dur="4.83">giving them dead where do you think the</text>
  <text start="123.56" dur="5.13">revenue is going to come from do pay for</text>
  <text start="126.26" dur="6.089">this additional debt they won&amp;#39;t be able</text>
  <text start="128.69" dur="7.68">to find it it will not happen so they</text>
  <text start="132.349" dur="7.89">will continually be in this collapse</text>
  <text start="136.37" dur="6.449">scenario the IMF knows it the central</text>
  <text start="140.239" dur="6.33">bankers know it and they realize that</text>
  <text start="142.819" dur="5.431">all of this it just can&amp;#39;t work the whole</text>
  <text start="146.569" dur="4.2">thing is just collapsing and falling</text>
  <text start="148.25" dur="5.91">apart right in front of our eyes I mean</text>
  <text start="150.769" dur="9.3">look at Japan right now their debt has</text>
  <text start="154.16" dur="9.54">reached all-time record high 1.0 57</text>
  <text start="160.069" dur="7.771">could drill Yin Yin</text>
  <text start="163.7" dur="8.85">that&amp;#39;s quadrillion how are they going to</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="9.96">pay this debt back it is in possible</text>
  <text start="172.55" dur="7.92">they cannot do it and this is not just</text>
  <text start="177.8" dur="6.74">happening in one or two countries this</text>
  <text start="180.47" dur="8.97">is happening in many countries and the</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="7.479">indicators that we are seeing it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="189.44" dur="6.6">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="192.019" dur="6.901">I mean here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="196.04" dur="5.37">understand the economy here is made up</text>
  <text start="198.92" dur="4.59">of consumerism people going out spending</text>
  <text start="201.41" dur="4.079">their money they make they have a job</text>
  <text start="203.51" dur="4.309">they make the money they go out and they</text>
  <text start="205.489" dur="4.59">spend the money manufacturing producing</text>
  <text start="207.819" dur="6.311">we&amp;#39;re really not seeing that right now</text>
  <text start="210.079" dur="6.601">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="214.13" dur="5.91">this so-called recovery is really</text>
  <text start="216.68" dur="5.85">starting to fall apart I mean things are</text>
  <text start="220.04" dur="5.759">coming out now and we&amp;#39;re seeing red</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="6.6">flashing warning signs all over the</text>
  <text start="225.799" dur="5.791">place and this is coming from the new</text>
  <text start="229.13" dur="5.55">york fed survey of consumer expectations</text>
  <text start="231.59" dur="7.56">we&amp;#39;ve learned that the US consumer has</text>
  <text start="234.68" dur="5.76">finally tapped out households reported</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="3.089">that they expected to increase their</text>
  <text start="240.44" dur="4.44">spending by just three point five</text>
  <text start="242.239" dur="6.78">percent in the next year a major drop</text>
  <text start="244.88" dur="10.439">from 4.3 percent the month before this</text>
  <text start="249.019" dur="8.671">was the lowest reading in history worse</text>
  <text start="255.319" dur="4.561">when adjusting the household inflation</text>
  <text start="257.69" dur="5.039">expectations which had been relatively</text>
  <text start="259.88" dur="5.55">flat if modestly declining around three</text>
  <text start="262.729" dur="5.041">percent real spending intentions when</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="5.37">adjusted for inflation just crashed to</text>
  <text start="267.77" dur="5.579">barely a positive point five percent</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="8.549">down over sixty percent from the prior</text>
  <text start="273.349" dur="8.761">month again we are seeing this system</text>
  <text start="279.349" dur="7.171">completely fall apart the biggest</text>
  <text start="282.11" dur="7.4">culprit in the collapse in spending was</text>
  <text start="286.52" dur="5.34">not the poor it was the middle class</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="6.17">those people are making between fifty</text>
  <text start="291.86" dur="7.51">and a hundred thousand dollars but</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="6.359">we&amp;#39;ve seen a huge collapse in spending</text>
  <text start="299.37" dur="7.07">from the wealthy those people who are</text>
  <text start="302.039" dur="4.401">making a hundred thousand or more and</text>
  <text start="307.07" dur="8.71">these people realize something is wrong</text>
  <text start="313.28" dur="5.639">they&amp;#39;re nervous they&amp;#39;re worried they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="5.28">seeing their colleagues get laid off and</text>
  <text start="318.919" dur="4.241">right now people are saying you know</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="7.65">something maybe this is not a good time</text>
  <text start="323.16" dur="8.37">to spend and we understand consumer</text>
  <text start="328.71" dur="8.76">spending makes up seventy percent of the</text>
  <text start="331.53" dur="7.74">gdp so if they&amp;#39;re not spending this</text>
  <text start="337.47" dur="3.96">entire system is going to collapse</text>
  <text start="339.27" dur="5.19">because this will then affect auto sales</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="7.709">it will affect housing sales it will</text>
  <text start="344.46" dur="6.84">affect retail sales and guess what we</text>
  <text start="349.139" dur="5.191">have a major collapse on hand and this</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="6.209">is what is happening at this point it is</text>
  <text start="354.33" dur="5.1">not going to get better anytime soon I</text>
  <text start="357.509" dur="3.331">understand we&amp;#39;re in the summer we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="3.93">going to be heading into the fall to the</text>
  <text start="360.84" dur="7.56">holiday season and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="11.19">complete disaster and we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="368.4" dur="11.04">now that the wage growth imploded on</text>
  <text start="374.55" dur="9.45">itself and right now people are making</text>
  <text start="379.44" dur="7.409">less and less money I mean the second</text>
  <text start="384" dur="5.699">quarter was a point five percent</text>
  <text start="386.849" dur="6.721">increase the weakest since the third</text>
  <text start="389.699" dur="8.84">quarter of 2014 wage growth in America</text>
  <text start="393.57" dur="10.379">is not robust the momentum is lost it is</text>
  <text start="398.539" dur="8.681">completely falling apart and if people</text>
  <text start="403.949" dur="7.921">aren&amp;#39;t making more money and wages</text>
  <text start="407.22" dur="7.59">continually drop this reflects in their</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="6.66">spending so it&amp;#39;s all starting to fit</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="7.38">together and it makes sense but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.53" dur="7.439">seeing something and basically it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="422.19" dur="5.94">telling us that we&amp;#39;re seeing a recession</text>
  <text start="425.969" dur="3.301">/ depression or for those people who</text>
  <text start="428.13" dur="3.99">believe we&amp;#39;ve been in every set</text>
  <text start="429.27" dur="6.21">/ depression all this time we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="432.12" dur="5.01">approaching a collapse and if we look at</text>
  <text start="435.48" dur="6.36">the ratio of wholesale inventories to</text>
  <text start="437.13" dur="7.41">sales which we are seeing right now it</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="5.88">is at the highest since the recession</text>
  <text start="444.54" dur="6.27">and right now it is flashing an enormous</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="7.38">red flag for an imminent recession in</text>
  <text start="450.81" dur="11.31">America because inventory to sales has</text>
  <text start="455.1" dur="11.64">been pushed back up to 1.3 and the auto</text>
  <text start="462.12" dur="7.86">industry is continually channel stuffing</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="5.72">the dealerships they have a bigger than</text>
  <text start="469.98" dur="7.74">expected point nine percent surge in</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="8.41">inventories so what are we seeing here</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="6.78">nobody is buying inventories are rising</text>
  <text start="480.87" dur="8.31">and right now if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="484.5" dur="9.86">let&amp;#39;s say we go back to 2001 we are</text>
  <text start="489.18" dur="10.88">approaching the one point three five and</text>
  <text start="494.36" dur="9.61">that signaled a recession in 2001 in</text>
  <text start="500.06" dur="6.28">2008 when we hit one point for its</text>
  <text start="503.97" dur="5.7">signal a recession we&amp;#39;re at one point</text>
  <text start="506.34" dur="8.84">three right now so we are seeing the</text>
  <text start="509.67" dur="12.21">same thing occur and we understand that</text>
  <text start="515.18" dur="9.88">this entire system is based on a central</text>
  <text start="521.88" dur="5.58">bank economy it&amp;#39;s not a people&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="525.06" dur="5.01">and people continually ask me why you</text>
  <text start="527.46" dur="6.18">keep talking about housing why is it</text>
  <text start="530.07" dur="6.35">important well housing is a very</text>
  <text start="533.64" dur="6.03">important component of any economy and</text>
  <text start="536.42" dur="6.7">often an indicator of the well-being of</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="6.12">a society in the US housing has been</text>
  <text start="543.12" dur="4.41">deteriorating since the subprime crisis</text>
  <text start="545.79" dur="4.56">yes they&amp;#39;ve been telling us we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="547.53" dur="5.97">recovery but we&amp;#39;ve never ever reached</text>
  <text start="550.35" dur="5.31">the same point that we were it was</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="5.55">pushed to up pushed up to a certain</text>
  <text start="555.66" dur="5.43">point and now it&amp;#39;s declining the housing</text>
  <text start="559.05" dur="3.75">market is the king it&amp;#39;s not in a</text>
  <text start="561.09" dur="5.16">recovery we&amp;#39;re see</text>
  <text start="562.8" dur="8.64">prices starting to fall and we have to</text>
  <text start="566.25" dur="7.68">remember that housing works when people</text>
  <text start="571.44" dur="5.79">are making more money so they can afford</text>
  <text start="573.93" dur="4.65">the higher price houses but right now</text>
  <text start="577.23" dur="4.89">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is wages are dropping</text>
  <text start="578.58" dur="5.9">people aren&amp;#39;t spending and prices were</text>
  <text start="582.12" dur="6.57">continually going up there finally</text>
  <text start="584.48" dur="8.109">strolling because the central bank who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="588.69" dur="5.55">been pushing the prices up can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="592.589" dur="4.701">anymore and the American people are</text>
  <text start="594.24" dur="5.36">saying we can&amp;#39;t afford these high prices</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="5.95">so what they&amp;#39;ve done is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="599.6" dur="5.2">suppressed interest rates they increase</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="3.15">the prices by keeping all the</text>
  <text start="604.8" dur="3.57">foreclosures off the market to drive the</text>
  <text start="606.39" dur="4.52">prices up they had hedge fund investment</text>
  <text start="608.37" dur="6.839">companies investing in these housing</text>
  <text start="610.91" dur="6.16">units not one or two but thousands of</text>
  <text start="615.209" dur="4.111">them they were told to hold on to them</text>
  <text start="617.07" dur="4.05">wrentham if you can to drive the prices</text>
  <text start="619.32" dur="4.079">up hoping that the people would run out</text>
  <text start="621.12" dur="5.13">there and buy all these homes it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="623.399" dur="5.821">work because they didn&amp;#39;t understand that</text>
  <text start="626.25" dur="5.07">people are tapped out the people have</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="4.859">nothing left and they realize this back</text>
  <text start="631.32" dur="4.259">in 2013 when the mortgage company</text>
  <text start="634.079" dur="5.161">started to lay off thousands upon</text>
  <text start="635.579" dur="8.041">thousands of people but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="639.24" dur="7.23">something else now rail traffic fell in</text>
  <text start="643.62" dur="4.89">July from a year ago an increase in</text>
  <text start="646.47" dur="3.96">container volumes couldn&amp;#39;t offset a</text>
  <text start="648.51" dur="3.84">steep decline in oil and coal shipments</text>
  <text start="650.43" dur="5.34">according to the association of american</text>
  <text start="652.35" dur="5.82">railroads traffic data indicates growth</text>
  <text start="655.77" dur="5.16">is slow and the recovery could be</text>
  <text start="658.17" dur="6.51">threatened by an inter interest rate</text>
  <text start="660.93" dur="7.23">increase by the Fed and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="664.68" dur="4.469">kind of slide before the number of Korra</text>
  <text start="668.16" dur="2.82">loads carrying oil and petroleum</text>

  <text start="673.38" dur="5.55">shipments have tumbled this year hurt by</text>

  <text start="678.93" dur="4.5">about the safety of transporting</text>
  <text start="680.88" dur="5.91">petroleum by rail and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="683.43" dur="6.029">before in previous years back in two</text>
  <text start="686.79" dur="6.51">thousand eight and we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="689.459" dur="6.391">thing occur now so we&amp;#39;re seeing all</text>
  <text start="693.3" dur="3.27">these indicators and they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="695.85" dur="4.26">flashing</text>
  <text start="696.57" dur="7.41">the red signal saying yes we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="700.11" dur="7.02">towards a collapse now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="703.98" dur="6.48">interesting about this and it seems that</text>
  <text start="707.13" dur="5.43">many people who are listening to the</text>
  <text start="710.46" dur="4.65">alternative or new media you know</text>
  <text start="712.56" dur="6.45">realize what&amp;#39;s going on they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="715.11" dur="6.12">accepting of it and they&amp;#39;re saying yes I</text>
  <text start="719.01" dur="4.41">see this those people who are listening</text>
  <text start="721.23" dur="5.22">to the corporate media still have their</text>
  <text start="723.42" dur="6.15">jobs not really paying attention usually</text>
  <text start="726.45" dur="5.76">we say those people are sleep but those</text>
  <text start="729.57" dur="5.79">people are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="732.21" dur="7.62">something&amp;#39;s up I mean we&amp;#39;ve seen many</text>
  <text start="735.36" dur="6.42">Gallup polls reporting on this and right</text>
  <text start="739.83" dur="5.55">now we see Americans who see economic</text>
  <text start="741.78" dur="5.7">deterioration are now outnumbering those</text>
  <text start="745.38" dur="5.4">people who believe the economy is</text>
  <text start="747.48" dur="6.69">getting better so people are starting to</text>
  <text start="750.78" dur="5.13">wake up and they&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="754.17" dur="4.14">economy is definitely getting worse and</text>
  <text start="755.91" dur="3.69">this happens when people say okay I have</text>
  <text start="758.31" dur="3.12">this great job they&amp;#39;re telling me that</text>
  <text start="759.6" dur="4.53">unemployment is continually dropping</text>
  <text start="761.43" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s in the five percent range and I</text>
  <text start="764.13" dur="3.87">should be able to put my resume out</text>
  <text start="765.33" dur="4.53">there and get a job lickety-split they</text>
  <text start="768" dur="5.22">put the resume out there and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="769.86" dur="4.74">nothing sudden then they start thinking</text>
  <text start="773.22" dur="3.78">why is this happening this doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="774.6" dur="4.65">sense and if I do get a response why</text>
  <text start="777" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t they want to pay me anymore why am</text>
  <text start="779.25" dur="4.08">I getting the same or less this makes no</text>
  <text start="781.53" dur="3.54">sense because normally when you switch a</text>
  <text start="783.33" dur="3.12">job you would like to make a couple</text>
  <text start="785.07" dur="3.96">thousand more than you were making</text>
  <text start="786.45" dur="5.46">before if you&amp;#39;re going to make less why</text>
  <text start="789.03" dur="5.58">switch it makes no sense and people are</text>
  <text start="791.91" dur="6.21">starting to realize that yeah something</text>
  <text start="794.61" dur="5.22">is going on here and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="798.12" dur="4.47">as Americans said the economy is getting</text>
  <text start="799.83" dur="7.56">better while fifty percent say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="802.59" dur="8.04">still getting worse so this shows us</text>
  <text start="807.39" dur="5.04">that people are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="810.63" dur="4.71">there&amp;#39;s something wrong with the economy</text>
  <text start="812.43" dur="6.3">and I know Obama going back in time said</text>
  <text start="815.34" dur="6.3">hey believe me the economy is getting</text>
  <text start="818.73" dur="4.59">better you don&amp;#39;t have to feel it just</text>
  <text start="821.64" dur="6.09">believe what I&amp;#39;m saying well I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="823.32" dur="6">if you really believe the economy is</text>
  <text start="827.73" dur="2.66">getting better you would feel it because</text>
  <text start="829.32" dur="3.71">you&amp;#39;d feel comfortable</text>
  <text start="830.39" dur="4.59">you would feel secure in your job you</text>
  <text start="833.03" dur="3.99">feel secure enough to go out and spend</text>
  <text start="834.98" dur="6.44">the money but people do not feel this</text>
  <text start="837.02" dur="6.42">way and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="841.42" dur="4.06">everything that&amp;#39;s been going on and</text>
  <text start="843.44" dur="6.03">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for quite</text>
  <text start="845.48" dur="7.86">a while how the dollar is basically at</text>
  <text start="849.47" dur="5.97">its end game and of course people say no</text>
  <text start="853.34" dur="5.07">you&amp;#39;re that&amp;#39;s ridiculous the dollar is</text>
  <text start="855.44" dur="4.47">strong it&amp;#39;s fantastic and John Kerry</text>
  <text start="858.41" dur="4.11">came out and said something very</text>
  <text start="859.91" dur="6.78">interesting today and this had to do</text>
  <text start="862.52" dur="7.47">with the Iran deal and he said the</text>
  <text start="866.69" dur="7.26">dollar will cease to be reserve currency</text>
  <text start="869.99" dur="7.53">of the world if a real if the Iran deal</text>
  <text start="873.95" dur="6.45">is rejected now I&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="877.52" dur="7.08">this for quite a while how they have to</text>
  <text start="880.4" dur="8">continually prop up the dollar in the</text>
  <text start="884.6" dur="7.94">middle east through Lebanon Libya Yemen</text>
  <text start="888.4" dur="7.93">Iraq go into new countries like Iran</text>
  <text start="892.54" dur="7.39">Syria now everyone believed that this</text>
  <text start="896.33" dur="5.94">deal was about nuclear weapons but</text>
  <text start="899.93" dur="5.31">really what is it really about because</text>
  <text start="902.27" dur="6.66">this is a very odd statement that John</text>
  <text start="905.24" dur="5.27">Kerry came out and said because if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="908.93" dur="3.69">just about nuclear weapons and</text>
  <text start="910.51" dur="6.19">everything is fine in the economy is</text>
  <text start="912.62" dur="7.01">strong why would this be a problem it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="916.7" dur="4.59">a problem because the United States</text>
  <text start="919.63" dur="4.42">understands the United States government</text>
  <text start="921.29" dur="4.98">central bankers maybe not the people so</text>
  <text start="924.05" dur="6.66">much except those who are listening to</text>
  <text start="926.27" dur="8.04">me and others they realize that the</text>
  <text start="930.71" dur="5.55">dollar is collapsing and they need to</text>
  <text start="934.31" dur="5.22">spread the debt to more and more</text>
  <text start="936.26" dur="7.17">countries they need to put the petro</text>
  <text start="939.53" dur="6.21">dollar on oil supplies to keep this</text>
  <text start="943.43" dur="6.75">system propped up this was the whole</text>
  <text start="945.74" dur="7.68">point of the Iran deal to infiltrate</text>
  <text start="950.18" dur="4.32">their central bank to make the deal to</text>
  <text start="953.42" dur="4.17">put the dollar on their natural</text>
  <text start="954.5" dur="6.06">resources to keep the system alive now</text>
  <text start="957.59" dur="4.35">if this deal doesn&amp;#39;t go through yes it</text>
  <text start="960.56" dur="3.42">would have an effect because you have to</text>
  <text start="961.94" dur="4.05">remember they need to continually put</text>
  <text start="963.98" dur="5.79">this out they need to capture the</text>
  <text start="965.99" dur="6">countries and place the dollar on their</text>
  <text start="969.77" dur="5.46">natural resources as these other</text>
  <text start="971.99" dur="8.12">countries fall apart Yemen Libya Lebanon</text>
  <text start="975.23" dur="7.92">Iraq they&amp;#39;re running into a problem and</text>
  <text start="980.11" dur="4.87">this is why we see things starting to</text>
  <text start="983.15" dur="4.23">really ramp up and fall apart and what</text>
  <text start="984.98" dur="4.76">they&amp;#39;re worried about is that if these</text>
  <text start="987.38" dur="6.9">countries are taken over by the people</text>
  <text start="989.74" dur="7.63">they will no longer use the dollar and</text>
  <text start="994.28" dur="4.29">if they no longer use the dollar for</text>
  <text start="997.37" dur="4.41">other countries to pay for the natural</text>
  <text start="998.57" dur="4.71">resources they don&amp;#39;t need the dollar in</text>
  <text start="1001.78" dur="2.34">reserve so other countries are going to</text>
  <text start="1003.28" dur="2.34">say you know something why are we</text>
  <text start="1004.12" dur="3.75">keeping these dolls and reserves we</text>
  <text start="1005.62" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t need them we&amp;#39;ll send them back to</text>
  <text start="1007.87" dur="2.91">the United States if they send the</text>
  <text start="1009.49" dur="4.7">dollars back to the United States what</text>
  <text start="1010.78" dur="7.41">happens here we have an influx of</text>
  <text start="1014.19" dur="5.74">dollars which means that the value of</text>
  <text start="1018.19" dur="6.15">the dollar decreases which means we see</text>
  <text start="1019.93" dur="8.55">inflation this is what is happening</text>
  <text start="1024.34" dur="7.14">right now and we understand that china</text>
  <text start="1028.48" dur="5.49">is trying to get you one as a reserve</text>
  <text start="1031.48" dur="6.27">currency included in the SDR basket with</text>
  <text start="1033.97" dur="5.94">the IMF and we also understand things</text>
  <text start="1037.75" dur="3.57">have been happening in China things have</text>
  <text start="1039.91" dur="4.23">been happening in the United States in</text>
  <text start="1041.32" dur="6.69">Europe because one way or another we are</text>
  <text start="1044.14" dur="6.21">all connected but again the country that</text>
  <text start="1048.01" dur="4.71">has the gold will turn out to be the</text>
  <text start="1050.35" dur="5.13">winner the country holding just paper</text>
  <text start="1052.72" dur="6.69">and ink will be the loser because if</text>
  <text start="1055.48" dur="6.56">they have no gold they&amp;#39;re done and this</text>
  <text start="1059.41" dur="7.71">is why China and Russia had been</text>
  <text start="1062.04" dur="7.72">continuously non stop purchasing gold so</text>
  <text start="1067.12" dur="4.41">China came out today and said they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1069.76" dur="5.31">going to devalue the you one by one</text>
  <text start="1071.53" dur="5.55">point nine percent and this sent the you</text>
  <text start="1075.07" dur="5.43">one back to the weakest since April of</text>
  <text start="1077.08" dur="6.66">2013 and basically what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1080.5" dur="7.83">happen now is the currency wars are</text>
  <text start="1083.74" dur="8.88">going to start once again and we can see</text>
  <text start="1088.33" dur="7.98">that other countries are going to have</text>
  <text start="1092.62" dur="5.28">to lower their currencies and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1096.31" dur="7.31">doing this to revive at</text>
  <text start="1097.9" dur="8.61">sports but we see Russia India Thailand</text>
  <text start="1103.62" dur="6.49">they&amp;#39;re going to prepare for this</text>
  <text start="1106.51" dur="5.61">currency war now Russia is out there and</text>
  <text start="1110.11" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re saying the you want the</text>
  <text start="1112.12" dur="5.88">evaluation will have no significant</text>
  <text start="1114.64" dur="6.15">impact on the Russian market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1118" dur="7.83">saying that the Chinese authorities and</text>
  <text start="1120.79" dur="7.98">the Russian market basically they trade</text>
  <text start="1125.83" dur="5.94">in you ones and it&amp;#39;s about seven percent</text>
  <text start="1128.77" dur="4.65">and we compete with China in almost none</text>
  <text start="1131.77" dur="4.29">of the product groups roughly speaking</text>
  <text start="1133.42" dur="4.26">our trade with China is our raw</text>
  <text start="1136.06" dur="4.74">materials in exchange for Chinese cars</text>
  <text start="1137.68" dur="6.84">and other finished products and the you</text>
  <text start="1140.8" dur="7.65">one right now is really hurting because</text>
  <text start="1144.52" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s pegged to the dollar and eventually</text>
  <text start="1148.45" dur="7.32">China would like to deep egg from the</text>
  <text start="1150.73" dur="9.3">dollar this is their whole goal and at</text>
  <text start="1155.77" dur="10.17">this point in time we can see the</text>
  <text start="1160.03" dur="9.69">currency wars have begun and this will</text>
  <text start="1165.94" dur="7.44">ramp up as time goes on and the United</text>
  <text start="1169.72" dur="7.35">States government is basically the</text>
  <text start="1173.38" dur="6.45">epicenter of this entire private western</text>
  <text start="1177.07" dur="5.97">central bank collapse and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1179.83" dur="6.03">be like a lake of water when you throw a</text>
  <text start="1183.04" dur="5.94">stone in the ripples are going to</text>
  <text start="1185.86" dur="6.84">basically go outward from that rock and</text>
  <text start="1188.98" dur="5.43">hit other countries and I know people</text>
  <text start="1192.7" dur="3.57">think it&amp;#39;s not really happening in the</text>
  <text start="1194.41" dur="2.88">United States because the US government</text>
  <text start="1196.27" dur="2.73">central bankers are telling us that</text>
  <text start="1197.29" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re in the recovery our statistics</text>
  <text start="1199" dur="4.83">look fantastic once that statistic can</text>
  <text start="1201.22" dur="5.13">be manipulated and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="1203.83" dur="4.02">that Europe is falling apart and it</text>
  <text start="1206.35" dur="4.64">might seem that it might seem like</text>
  <text start="1207.85" dur="5.61">Europe is going to fall apart first and</text>
  <text start="1210.99" dur="4.87">then hit the United States but really</text>
  <text start="1213.46" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s coming from the United States it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1215.86" dur="5.51">all the policies of the United States</text>
  <text start="1217.75" dur="7.08">that&amp;#39;s causing all of this to occur and</text>
  <text start="1221.37" dur="5.6">it will come right back to the United</text>
  <text start="1224.83" dur="5.11">States</text>
  <text start="1226.97" dur="7.38">and this whole thing will come crumbling</text>
  <text start="1229.94" dur="6.599">down and this is why continuously over</text>
  <text start="1234.35" dur="4.41">and over everyone needs to be prepared I</text>
