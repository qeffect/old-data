  <text start="77.039" dur="5.61">gdp hitting what was a two point nine</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="8.099">percent and we need to think to</text>
  <text start="82.649" dur="8.731">ourselves how can this possibly be how</text>
  <text start="87.569" dur="8.821">can the economy all of a sudden and go</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="8.46">from one percent 1.5% and shoot up out</text>
  <text start="96.39" dur="5.42">of nowhere to two point nine percent I</text>
  <text start="99.84" dur="4.65">mean do we really believe that</text>
  <text start="101.81" dur="5.14">manufacturing just took off we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="5.969">following manufacturing we know this</text>

  <text start="110.459" dur="6.211">we just started to export goods like</text>
  <text start="113.039" dur="6.81">crazy well beam following what the</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="6.179">United States has been producing and we</text>
  <text start="119.849" dur="4.94">know that this can&amp;#39;t be true do you</text>
  <text start="122.849" dur="4.591">think the people just all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="124.789" dur="5.261">started to spend money and retail is</text>
  <text start="127.44" dur="4.35">doing incredibly well well we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="6.359">following spending we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="131.79" dur="8.369">retail and we know this can&amp;#39;t be true so</text>
  <text start="136.409" dur="6.871">what actually happened here well what</text>
  <text start="140.159" dur="8.041">they did was they manipulated the GDP</text>
  <text start="143.28" dur="7.349">numbers instead of manipulating</text>
  <text start="148.2" dur="5.73">unemployment people weren&amp;#39;t buying it</text>
  <text start="150.629" dur="7.14">and people were looking at GDP they said</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="7.71">you know something we better improve the</text>
  <text start="157.769" dur="7.021">economy to make it look good during the</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="7.409">election and this is exactly what they</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="6.089">did and we can see right now people are</text>
  <text start="169.049" dur="2.821">going to look at this number going to</text>
  <text start="170.879" dur="4.071">the election and they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="6.72">wow the economy it is doing fantastic</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="5.53">everything is improving but really is it</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="5.039">let&amp;#39;s take a look</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="5.58">we see out in London for instance where</text>
  <text start="183.629" dur="4.381">everyone believed that housing was</text>
  <text start="186.06" dur="3.149">continually moving up and up and up and</text>
  <text start="188.01" dur="2.97">here in the United States we believe</text>
  <text start="189.209" dur="3.42">that housing prices are continually</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="4.44">moving up and up and up Sam in Canada</text>
  <text start="192.629" dur="6.69">and Australia throughout Europe but we</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="6.929">are seeing that housing prices are not</text>
  <text start="199.319" dur="6.601">continually moving up they are starting</text>
  <text start="202.349" dur="5.761">to fall right now and we know that the</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="4.23">United the central bank&amp;#39;s they can only</text>
  <text start="208.11" dur="4.08">blow the bubbles up in certain areas</text>
  <text start="210.15" dur="4.589">they can&amp;#39;t hit every single area it is</text>
  <text start="212.19" dur="5.87">completely impossible and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.739" dur="7.741">seeing right now out in London is that</text>
  <text start="218.06" dur="6.039">housing prices are falling out of a</text>
  <text start="222.48" dur="5.96">hundred and thirty pages of</text>
  <text start="224.099" dur="8.881">advertisements with 15 ads per page</text>
  <text start="228.44" dur="10.859">nearly half of all properties or 53 of</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="10.53">the pages show a price reduction now</text>
  <text start="239.299" dur="7">this is in London here in the United</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="6.03">States we&amp;#39;ve been saying this for quite</text>
  <text start="246.299" dur="5.851">a while if you go outside of the 20</text>
  <text start="249.54" dur="5.029">cities that case shiller looks at we</text>
  <text start="252.15" dur="8.28">haven&amp;#39;t seen the same exact thing that</text>
  <text start="254.569" dur="8.051">people are reducing their prices and we</text>
  <text start="260.43" dur="4.709">can see right now the housing market</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="7.5">around the world it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="265.139" dur="8">decline and it&amp;#39;s declining rapidly but</text>
  <text start="270.12" dur="7.859">here in the United States we see that</text>
  <text start="273.139" dur="7.811">the US government is trying to create</text>
  <text start="277.979" dur="5.69">this bigger illusion that the economy is</text>
  <text start="280.95" dur="4.8">doing better than it really is and</text>
  <text start="283.669" dur="5.891">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do this all</text>
  <text start="285.75" dur="5.4">throughout the what is it the eight</text>
  <text start="289.56" dur="6.27">years or so since the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="6.329">and we can see right now not many people</text>
  <text start="295.83" dur="6.11">are buying this and I think this is why</text>
  <text start="297.479" dur="8.281">they wanted to up the GDP numbers to</text>
  <text start="301.94" dur="5.92">make that seem like the economy&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="305.76" dur="4.589">really doing well because if you look at</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="5.78">the image final October Consumer</text>
  <text start="310.349" dur="8.391">Sentiment Index it is dropped</text>
  <text start="313.64" dur="7.87">287 point to the lowest since 2014 and</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="6.55">we can see right now that when we look</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="6.09">at Bloomberg we look at the Gallup polls</text>
  <text start="325.29" dur="4.17">we look at the governor board we look at</text>
  <text start="327.6" dur="3.92">all of these different indicators about</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="5.97">consumer confidence we see they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="6.55">declining right now when we look at Pitt</text>
  <text start="335.43" dur="6.39">business conditions moving forward we</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="5.67">see that is also declining so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.82" dur="4.14">seeing is that people aren&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="343.74" dur="4.11">believing and they they knew this and I</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="3.96">believe at this point since we&amp;#39;re days</text>
  <text start="347.85" dur="4.29">away from the election they needed</text>
  <text start="349.92" dur="5.58">something to make people believe that</text>
  <text start="352.14" dur="5.97">the economy is doing well and I believe</text>
  <text start="355.5" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re making their move with this GDP</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="4.62">number and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the</text>
  <text start="360.15" dur="4.17">economic indicators and if we look at</text>
  <text start="362.73" dur="4.47">business investment and we talked about</text>
  <text start="364.32" dur="6">durable goods before we see that this</text>
  <text start="367.2" dur="6.6">plays a huge role in the economic growth</text>
  <text start="370.32" dur="7.2">and it just booked its worst September</text>
  <text start="373.8" dur="4.88">since 2010 the census bureau reported</text>
  <text start="377.52" dur="3.18">today that orders for durable goods</text>
  <text start="378.68" dur="4.51">products and equipment designed to last</text>
  <text start="380.7" dur="4.62">over three years inched up about 2.4</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="5.07">billion in September or about one</text>
  <text start="385.32" dur="4.8">percent from a year ago on a 4.5 billion</text>
  <text start="388.26" dur="4.95">year over your surge of defense capital</text>
  <text start="390.12" dur="4.62">goods now if you exclude defense orders</text>
  <text start="393.21" dur="4.35">really felt like we said yesterday by</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="6.87">two-point-three percent now in the past</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="6.81">this was due to oil gas industry</text>
  <text start="401.61" dur="5.46">cutbacks but mostly now they have run</text>
  <text start="404.37" dur="4.8">their course so year-over-year decline</text>
  <text start="407.07" dur="5.51">in September has hardly the fault of the</text>
  <text start="409.17" dur="5.94">oil and gas industry and when we look at</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="6.97">the graph going back to nineteen</text>
  <text start="415.11" dur="8.55">ninety-five every time we&amp;#39;ve reached</text>
  <text start="419.55" dur="7.59">this point in new waters non-defense</text>
  <text start="423.66" dur="6.42">capital goods durable goods we can see</text>
  <text start="427.14" dur="5.37">right now that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="430.08" dur="5.85">deteriorating and if we look at it right</text>
  <text start="432.51" dur="5.91">before 2001 crash we hit about sixty</text>
  <text start="435.93" dur="4.2">eight billion dollars and then it</text>
  <text start="438.42" dur="8.429">declined rapidly after that we were in a</text>
  <text start="440.13" dur="10.14">recession in 2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="7.71">we hit about 69 billion or so and then</text>
  <text start="450.27" dur="8.549">all of a sudden it rapidly declined here</text>
  <text start="454.559" dur="8.73">in 20 15 or so right before 2015 we hit</text>
  <text start="458.819" dur="9.36">around 69 billion once again we are now</text>
  <text start="463.289" dur="7.65">down to 64 billion and we can see right</text>
  <text start="468.179" dur="6.98">now that this is going to go further and</text>
  <text start="470.939" dur="7.38">further down and we are in a recession</text>
  <text start="475.159" dur="6.75">now you have to go all the way back to</text>
  <text start="478.319" dur="9.39">September of 2010 to find lower business</text>
  <text start="481.909" dur="8.41">investment I mean this tells you that</text>
  <text start="487.709" dur="7.92">they are just trying to keep this</text>
  <text start="490.319" dur="7.08">economy chugging along and it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="495.629" dur="4.26">harder and harder because you can see</text>
  <text start="497.399" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re in a downward trajectory and every</text>
  <text start="499.889" dur="5.851">single time throughout history we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="502.559" dur="7.59">seen the same thing occur we head into a</text>
  <text start="505.74" dur="7.14">huge recession and right now from this</text>
  <text start="510.149" dur="7.32">data it looks like we&amp;#39;re already in the</text>
  <text start="512.88" dur="7.349">recession now today they came out with</text>
  <text start="517.469" dur="5.55">the GDP numbers they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="520.229" dur="7.261">everything is fantastic GDB jump to</text>
  <text start="523.019" dur="6.06">two-point-nine percent and everyone</text>
  <text start="527.49" dur="3.839">sitting there and the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="529.079" dur="4.31">out there saying ah you see we have take</text>
  <text start="531.329" dur="7.981">off everything is fantastic it looks</text>
  <text start="533.389" dur="10.661">incredible so what caused it why did GDP</text>
  <text start="539.31" dur="8.009">all of a sudden jump from a model from</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="5.67">the Atlanta Fed of about 1.2 percent or</text>
  <text start="547.319" dur="4.231">point nine percent why all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="549.72" dur="4.229">did we get two point nine percent now</text>
  <text start="551.55" dur="6.139">did it come from consumer spending no</text>
  <text start="553.949" dur="6.81">not really that wasn&amp;#39;t it there was a</text>
  <text start="557.689" dur="8.621">inventory accumulation we did see that</text>
  <text start="560.759" dur="8.221">and we saw something in exports so when</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="5.91">we dig deeper into the numbers they</text>
  <text start="568.98" dur="7.049">reveal something very fascinating that</text>
  <text start="572.22" dur="7.38">this spike in exports even with the</text>
  <text start="576.029" dur="4.711">stronger dollar was the highest seen in</text>
  <text start="579.6" dur="4.02">over two years</text>
  <text start="580.74" dur="6.24">and amounted to 49 billion or roughly</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="5.55">forty one percent of the nominal 119</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="5.82">billion annualized increase in the third</text>
  <text start="589.17" dur="7.5">quarter of GDP and it gets even more</text>
  <text start="592.8" dur="10.92">surprising because when we look we find</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="11.69">out it was soybeans so soybeans was the</text>
  <text start="603.72" dur="9.09">cause of this surge we exported soybeans</text>
  <text start="608.36" dur="7.3">now when we look at this the soybean</text>
  <text start="612.81" dur="5.16">exports meant that the seasonally</text>
  <text start="615.66" dur="3.869">adjusted food feed and beverage exports</text>
  <text start="617.97" dur="4.65">are up a hundred and twenty one percent</text>
  <text start="619.529" dur="6.441">in three month on three-month annualized</text>
  <text start="622.62" dur="7.589">terms the soybean boost is indeed a</text>
  <text start="625.97" dur="7.33">one-time thing it has no implications</text>
  <text start="630.209" dur="6.181">for growth or trending growth or</text>
  <text start="633.3" dur="5.539">anything like that whatsoever it looks</text>
  <text start="636.39" dur="5.34">like the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="638.839" dur="8.62">they plan this they were holding it back</text>
  <text start="641.73" dur="9.69">and they used it to pump up gdp at the</text>
  <text start="647.459" dur="7.771">last minute right before the election</text>
  <text start="651.42" dur="5.7">time this was pre-planned because if you</text>
  <text start="655.23" dur="5.07">strip all of this out you strip out</text>
  <text start="657.12" dur="6.719">soybeans you strip out Obamacare</text>
  <text start="660.3" dur="6.99">spending the US economy grew by point</text>
  <text start="663.839" dur="6.631">nine percent if they let that number out</text>
  <text start="667.29" dur="6.57">during this period it would be a</text>
  <text start="670.47" dur="7.619">complete disaster so what they did is</text>
  <text start="673.86" dur="5.49">they manipulated this entire GDP now</text>
  <text start="678.089" dur="3.541">what they&amp;#39;re going to do going forward</text>
  <text start="679.35" dur="4.92">is you&amp;#39;re going to see revisions like</text>
  <text start="681.63" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;ve never seen before and the GDP is</text>
  <text start="684.27" dur="4.559">just going to take a nosedive and</text>
  <text start="685.86" dur="4.86">everyone&amp;#39;s going to say unexpectedly we</text>
  <text start="688.829" dur="3.931">don&amp;#39;t know how this happened we thought</text>
  <text start="690.72" dur="4.83">we were at takeoff here we thought the</text>
  <text start="692.76" dur="5.21">economy was going to boom because you</text>
  <text start="695.55" dur="7.65">have to remember throughout this year</text>
  <text start="697.97" dur="8.05">Obama couldn&amp;#39;t get gdp over whatever was</text>
  <text start="703.2" dur="4.86">two percent or so and people were</text>
  <text start="706.02" dur="4.71">pointing their fingers at it saying look</text>
  <text start="708.06" dur="5.37">at this GDP is declining we&amp;#39;re at 1.8</text>
  <text start="710.73" dur="3.49">were at 1.7 were at 1.5 is just getting</text>
  <text start="713.43" dur="3.31">worse</text>
  <text start="714.22" dur="7.14">how is the economy improving if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="716.74" dur="6.21">see GDP up around three percent and you</text>
  <text start="721.36" dur="3.9">have to remember the people are just</text>
  <text start="722.95" dur="5.13">going to see the headlines they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="725.26" dur="3.99">going to see what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="728.08" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re going to see two-point-nine</text>
  <text start="729.25" dur="4.89">percent and they&amp;#39;re going to think that</text>
  <text start="731.47" dur="4.56">this is the gdp for the entire year that</text>
  <text start="734.14" dur="4.5">everything is improved and this is</text>
  <text start="736.03" dur="6.36">exactly what they wanted it&amp;#39;s propaganda</text>
  <text start="738.64" dur="6.66">now Moody&amp;#39;s is out there warning</text>
  <text start="742.39" dur="5.87">Deutsche Bank that they&amp;#39;re very close to</text>
  <text start="745.3" dur="6.9">falling below their default point and</text>
  <text start="748.26" dur="6.04">what they said is that their default</text>
  <text start="752.2" dur="4.26">frequency remains at one of the highest</text>
  <text start="754.3" dur="3.69">levels in the banking industry despite</text>
  <text start="756.46" dur="6.2">the bank&amp;#39;s efforts to shore up capital</text>
  <text start="757.99" dur="9.75">positions and they said any type of</text>
  <text start="762.66" dur="8.02">unexpected economic crisis or situation</text>
  <text start="767.74" dur="5.76">or anything like that well deutsche bank</text>
  <text start="770.68" dur="5.1">is going to have a major problem they</text>
  <text start="773.5" dur="5.73">also said deutsche bank&amp;#39;s risk has been</text>
  <text start="775.78" dur="5.85">steadily increasing since 2008 well we</text>
  <text start="779.23" dur="4.02">all knew this we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this</text>
  <text start="781.63" dur="4.14">and we&amp;#39;re saying that Deutsche Bank has</text>
  <text start="783.25" dur="4.67">always had a problem and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="785.77" dur="5.22">to have a continuous problem because</text>
