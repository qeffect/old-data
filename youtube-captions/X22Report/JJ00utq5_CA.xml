  <text start="45.49" dur="7.87">basically to kick the can down the</text>
  <text start="48.89" dur="5.85">street or do anything else so basically</text>
  <text start="53.36" dur="4.23">they don&amp;#39;t know what to do at this point</text>
  <text start="54.74" dur="4.89">and they&amp;#39;re testing the waters but</text>
  <text start="57.59" dur="4.44">before we get into that let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="59.63" dur="5.48">the economic collapse news and let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="62.03" dur="7.94">what&amp;#39;s going on it out in the world and</text>
  <text start="65.11" dur="7.9">let&amp;#39;s see what everyone is up to here</text>
  <text start="69.97" dur="6.67">now basically what i was saying before</text>
  <text start="73.01" dur="6.33">the Fed cannot exit successfully and</text>
  <text start="76.64" dur="6.68">they know this they know if they start</text>
  <text start="79.34" dur="6.209">to taper and they start to pull back the</text>
  <text start="83.32" dur="4.63">economy will completely collapse and</text>
  <text start="85.549" dur="5.341">they know this for a fact and basically</text>
  <text start="87.95" dur="5.16">this article says Bernanke claims the</text>
  <text start="90.89" dur="6.12">Fed can successfully exit its current</text>
  <text start="93.11" dur="6.6">strategy but he&amp;#39;s lying he knows he can</text>
  <text start="97.01" dur="5.789">and basically what he&amp;#39;s doing now is</text>
  <text start="99.71" dur="5.51">he&amp;#39;s testing the waters he wants to see</text>
  <text start="102.799" dur="6.691">how the market is going to react and</text>
  <text start="105.22" dur="6.52">from this point this is when he&amp;#39;ll you</text>
  <text start="109.49" dur="3.629">know come up with you know because what</text>
  <text start="111.74" dur="3.39">basically what he&amp;#39;s going to say is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.119" dur="5.161">going to tell on wednesday that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="115.13" dur="5.669">going to the taper off they&amp;#39;re thinking</text>
  <text start="118.28" dur="5.19">about doing it but he&amp;#39;ll always throw in</text>
  <text start="120.799" dur="6.541">the words but it depends on the economy</text>
  <text start="123.47" dur="7.2">and it depends on unemployment it</text>
  <text start="127.34" dur="5.49">depends on how the economy looks so</text>
  <text start="130.67" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;re going to hold off now and he</text>
  <text start="132.83" dur="3.059">continually does this because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="134.54" dur="4.349">testing the waters because you have to</text>
  <text start="135.889" dur="5.041">remember they are printing all this</text>
  <text start="138.889" dur="6.031">money even though he says there</text>
  <text start="140.93" dur="8.039">and they&amp;#39;re buying up a toxic real</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="6.78">estate and they&amp;#39;re also buying Treasury</text>
  <text start="148.969" dur="5.731">bonds and also giving a lot of this</text>
  <text start="151.7" dur="6.33">money to the banks so they can reinvest</text>
  <text start="154.7" dur="7.2">that money into the stock market and by</text>
  <text start="158.03" dur="7.14">doing this this money never reaches the</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="5.729">people so this way you don&amp;#39;t see massive</text>
  <text start="165.17" dur="4.92">inflation he&amp;#39;s putting it all back into</text>
  <text start="167.629" dur="5.521">the equity market a lot of the banks are</text>
  <text start="170.09" dur="6.119">buying their own stocks so you see none</text>
  <text start="173.15" dur="5.28">of what people thought were going to</text>
  <text start="176.209" dur="3.84">happen with massive inflation from</text>
  <text start="178.43" dur="3.419">printing money because they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="180.049" dur="6.541">giving it to the banks and banks are not</text>
  <text start="181.849" dur="6.691">loaning out this money at all and I hate</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="3.72">to say it but most of the people in the</text>
  <text start="188.54" dur="4.229">market today are the institutional</text>
  <text start="190.31" dur="5.099">investors most of the everyday traitor</text>
  <text start="192.769" dur="5.991">are out of the market and if he knows</text>
  <text start="195.409" dur="6.33">that when he starts tapering this back</text>
  <text start="198.76" dur="6.479">he&amp;#39;s basically tapering what he did and</text>
  <text start="201.739" dur="6.451">the markets going to start falling and</text>
  <text start="205.239" dur="5.34">this is what he knows is going to happen</text>
  <text start="208.19" dur="5.1">and this is why he&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="210.579" dur="5.201">conservative and he&amp;#39;s using this</text>
  <text start="213.29" dur="5.25">strategy to see what would happen when</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="5.699">he mentions it and this is why they keep</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="5.369">changing unemployment and things like</text>
  <text start="221.479" dur="5.4">that in the calculations because the</text>
  <text start="223.909" dur="5.19">economy is an illusion and people think</text>
  <text start="226.879" dur="4.2">that everything is getting better and</text>
  <text start="229.099" dur="4.051">but it&amp;#39;s really not and the unemployment</text>
  <text start="231.079" dur="6.27">has ticked up which is buying him some</text>
  <text start="233.15" dur="5.88">time right now and they change they</text>
  <text start="237.349" dur="3.75">recently changed the equation because I</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="4.319">really do think in his head that he</text>
  <text start="241.099" dur="7.051">thinks that he&amp;#39;ll be able to keep this</text>
  <text start="243.349" dur="8.25">going and but you know until it</text>
  <text start="248.15" dur="6.449">collapses and but there&amp;#39;s it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="251.599" dur="7.89">there&amp;#39;s no manufacturing people or have</text>
  <text start="254.599" dur="9">no jobs there&amp;#39;s no tax base to continue</text>
  <text start="259.489" dur="7.231">everything going so the whole thing no</text>
  <text start="263.599" dur="6.81">matter if he tapers or if he continually</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="6.82">pumps in money um it&amp;#39;s going to collapse</text>
  <text start="270.409" dur="7.001">either way and he knows it</text>
  <text start="273.54" dur="6.9">this is his problem now moving on here</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="8.16">aetna is pulling out of California due</text>
  <text start="280.44" dur="8.82">to obamacare and in Obamacare people who</text>
  <text start="285.57" dur="5.97">have policies now it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="289.26" dur="5.97">because the insurance companies can</text>
  <text start="291.54" dur="6.24">always say that oh you know what because</text>
  <text start="295.23" dur="4.62">of Obamacare and you can go and pick a</text>
  <text start="297.78" dur="4.83">different health insurance from the</text>
  <text start="299.85" dur="5.16">exchange we&amp;#39;re discontinuing the</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="4.62">coverage that you have now and we want</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="3.93">you to go to the exchange and buy a</text>
  <text start="307.23" dur="5.69">different policy which will be more</text>
  <text start="308.94" dur="6.3">money and right now basically you know</text>
  <text start="312.92" dur="3.94">basically Obama&amp;#39;s care stated goal was</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="3.81">to broaden the health insurance market</text>
  <text start="316.86" dur="4.19">give more options consumers and</text>
  <text start="319.05" dur="5.25">generally lower cost of health insurance</text>
  <text start="321.05" dur="4.98">but you know courtesy of the IRS</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="4.86">flawless execution of yet another</text>
  <text start="326.03" dur="5.41">unprecedented government expansion it</text>
  <text start="329.16" dur="4.17">may be in for a tough time and again I</text>
  <text start="331.44" dur="3.48">said this before when you&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="6.03">something and you&amp;#39;re doing it for the</text>
  <text start="334.92" dur="7.37">people the law that you pass should not</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="6.33">penalize people if they do not follow it</text>
  <text start="342.29" dur="6.34">especially when something is voluntary</text>
  <text start="345.69" dur="5.82">like health insurance basically people</text>
  <text start="348.63" dur="4.62">have the choice of purchasing it but yet</text>
  <text start="351.51" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re not making it a choice they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="6.09">making it if you don&amp;#39;t do this you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="355.23" dur="7.2">taxed and this is not a good system this</text>
  <text start="359.34" dur="6.57">is not a system for the people this is a</text>
  <text start="362.43" dur="8.01">system for the insurance companies to</text>
  <text start="365.91" dur="7.25">make more money and to raise revenues to</text>
  <text start="370.44" dur="6.03">hold off this collapse that is coming</text>
  <text start="373.16" dur="7.63">now there was another article in here</text>
  <text start="376.47" dur="8.55">that says Cypress balan now in the UK</text>
  <text start="380.79" dur="6.87">and basically it goes on to say co-op</text>
  <text start="385.02" dur="4.5">bank Baylen converts loans to shares and</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="4.32">this is what happened in Cyprus they</text>
  <text start="389.52" dur="3.96">took some of their money they froze it</text>
  <text start="391.98" dur="3.69">and they said we&amp;#39;re too you know I mean</text>
  <text start="393.48" dur="4.05">they took a portion a percentage of</text>
  <text start="395.67" dur="4.53">their money and they change them into</text>
  <text start="397.53" dur="4.71">bank stock and this article goes on to</text>
  <text start="400.2" dur="3.3">say that the co-operative group has</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="3.63">reached agreement with the city</text>
  <text start="403.5" dur="3.629">regulator that the whole and the coop</text>
  <text start="405.87" dur="4.019">bank is around one</text>
  <text start="407.129" dur="7.171">15 billion euros and basically what</text>
  <text start="409.889" dur="11.25">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is to do a bail-in</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="9.269">just like they did with Cyprus and this</text>
  <text start="421.139" dur="4.68">article goes on to say that you know all</text>
  <text start="423.569" dur="4.291">the depositors in the quality relieved</text>
  <text start="425.819" dur="3.42">that the bank is being rescued the</text>
  <text start="427.86" dur="3.779">nature of the rescue will be highly</text>
  <text start="429.239" dur="4.85">controversial because it may well be</text>
  <text start="431.639" dur="8.04">seen as the coop bank moving away from</text>
  <text start="434.089" dur="7.961">being pure Mutual and basically it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="439.679" dur="3.84">coop is expected to remain the majority</text>
  <text start="442.05" dur="3.869">controlling shareholders in the coop</text>
  <text start="443.519" dur="3.96">bank but significantly minority will be</text>
  <text start="445.919" dur="5.131">held by commercial investors and</text>
  <text start="447.479" dur="6.3">basically goes on to say this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="5.009">unclear at this time whether the</text>
  <text start="453.779" dur="5.34">debt-for-equity swap will apply only to</text>
  <text start="456.059" dur="8.52">holders of subordinate debt which is the</text>
  <text start="459.119" dur="8.52">debt perceived as riskier basically in</text>
  <text start="464.579" dur="6.9">you know those unsecured debt they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.639" dur="5.79">know if if this is all that the beylin</text>
  <text start="471.479" dur="4.53">is going to consist of and as we know</text>
  <text start="473.429" dur="4.35">from the past the bail and always</text>
  <text start="476.009" dur="3.9">consists of more because they always</text>
  <text start="477.779" dur="3.961">need more money because basically you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.909" dur="4.951">just taking some of the money you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.74" dur="5.279">covering this debt and when that money</text>
  <text start="484.86" dur="4.169">runs out they need more and i said this</text>
  <text start="487.019" dur="4.56">explanation before it&amp;#39;s like a person</text>
  <text start="489.029" dur="5.521">who&amp;#39;s making $50,000 they have no job</text>
  <text start="491.579" dur="4.98">they have twenty thousand dollars left</text>
  <text start="494.55" dur="5.039">in their savings and they use this</text>
  <text start="496.559" dur="4.92">twenty thousand to pay for all of their</text>
  <text start="499.589" dur="5.55">debt but they keep taking out more</text>
  <text start="501.479" dur="5.27">credit card to cover their expenses now</text>
  <text start="505.139" dur="3.96">they have to sell their car and</text>
  <text start="506.749" dur="4.84">basically they are always looking for</text>
  <text start="509.099" dur="5.011">new sources of money to cover their debt</text>
  <text start="511.589" dur="5.31">because the debt payments don&amp;#39;t go away</text>
  <text start="514.11" dur="8.029">but the money after you use it does go</text>
  <text start="516.899" dur="8.971">away so that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing here</text>
  <text start="522.139" dur="6.13">and it also goes on to say though you</text>
  <text start="525.87" dur="4.38">know that the beylin represents a</text>
  <text start="528.269" dur="4.68">profound change in the business model of</text>
  <text start="530.25" dur="5.67">the coop bank as the typical owner of</text>
  <text start="532.949" dur="5.19">these pigs are pensioners attracted by</text>
  <text start="535.92" dur="3.87">study guaranteed income it seems these</text>
  <text start="538.139" dur="3.361">days of hoping for a bailout is</text>
  <text start="539.79" dur="6.87">completely gone</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="9.78">all financial type of entities are</text>
  <text start="546.66" dur="8.31">looking at the bell end today okay</text>
  <text start="551.28" dur="6.09">moving on breaking in Aleppo it looks</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="7.2">like Syria 80,000 troops are about to</text>
  <text start="557.37" dur="7.95">storm the city and I mean the the war is</text>
  <text start="562.17" dur="4.8">building up it says here we go 80,000</text>
  <text start="565.32" dur="5.73">Hezbollah trained troops to storm to</text>
  <text start="566.97" dur="7.14">northern Syria city of Aleppo and it</text>
  <text start="571.05" dur="5.49">looks like the US House passes bill to</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="6.3">ensure Israel can remove existential</text>
  <text start="576.54" dur="8.24">threats this is just confirming that we</text>
  <text start="580.41" dur="8.55">will definitely go to war with Israel</text>
  <text start="584.78" dur="5.8">when the Iran part of the war starts</text>
  <text start="588.96" dur="3.75">Nash and it goes on to say the National</text>
  <text start="590.58" dur="3.87">Defense Authorization Act instructs us</text>
  <text start="592.71" dur="3.72">to take all necessary steps to help</text>
  <text start="594.45" dur="5.07">Israel defend its vital national</text>
  <text start="596.43" dur="6.6">interest among the among them preventing</text>
  <text start="599.52" dur="6.15">a nuclear Iran and this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="603.03" dur="4.74">seen before during the Boston bombing</text>
  <text start="605.67" dur="8.42">when they signed the bill that we will</text>
  <text start="607.77" dur="8.88">help Israel go help Israel with the war</text>
  <text start="614.09" dur="5.98">when they get into the war with Iran and</text>
  <text start="616.65" dur="6.78">this is just reinforcing that because</text>
  <text start="620.07" dur="5.94">again the central bankers the Fed the</text>
  <text start="623.43" dur="4.38">government know the collapse is comming</text>
  <text start="626.01" dur="6.75">there&amp;#39;s only one way out of this and</text>
  <text start="627.81" dur="8.18">that is a war and it was I was having a</text>
  <text start="632.76" dur="5.37">discussion on YouTube with someone and</text>
  <text start="635.99" dur="4.84">basically you have to remember these</text>
  <text start="638.13" dur="6.09">central bankers they have no allegiance</text>
  <text start="640.83" dur="5.4">to a country they are the issuers of</text>
  <text start="644.22" dur="5.07">money they print money out of thin air</text>
  <text start="646.23" dur="6.57">and what they asked for return is you</text>
  <text start="649.29" dur="6.36">repay this money with interest and then</text>
  <text start="652.8" dur="6.3">they take this and they trade this</text>
  <text start="655.65" dur="6.87">worthless printed paper that has no</text>
  <text start="659.1" dur="6.02">backing whatsoever and they traded for</text>
  <text start="662.52" dur="6.69">real assets like gold and silver oil</text>
  <text start="665.12" dur="8.53">land natural resources so they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="669.21" dur="5.76">care about the country itself all they</text>
  <text start="673.65" dur="4.379">care about</text>
  <text start="674.97" dur="5.159">is one covering up the collapse so it</text>
  <text start="678.029" dur="4.891">never comes out that they do this type</text>
  <text start="680.129" dur="5.371">of thing to countries with creating</text>
  <text start="682.92" dur="5.519">central banks and the other thing is</text>
  <text start="685.5" dur="4.589">they make a lot of money during war they</text>
  <text start="688.439" dur="5.88">don&amp;#39;t care if nuclear weapons and you</text>
  <text start="690.089" dur="5.85">destroy cities or countries it makes no</text>
  <text start="694.319" dur="4.14">difference because those apply both</text>
  <text start="695.939" dur="5.76">sides of the war and the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="698.459" dur="5.971">will go into debt to pay back for the</text>
  <text start="701.699" dur="5.88">for these wars I mean this is what they</text>
  <text start="704.43" dur="5.579">do their children do not go to the same</text>
  <text start="707.579" dur="5.19">schools we go to they go to a private</text>
  <text start="710.009" dur="4.411">school which is not in if you&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="712.769" dur="4.92">US not in the US remember they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="714.42" dur="8.419">have an allegiance to a country their</text>
  <text start="717.689" dur="8.431">allegiance is to this money printing</text>

  <text start="1206.97" dur="7.569">each time there is a drill something</text>
  <text start="1211.09" dur="6.659">happens something a false flag event</text>
  <text start="1214.539" dur="5.25">happens and this just this i just</text>
  <text start="1217.749" dur="6.53">realized and it just came out today that</text>
  <text start="1219.789" dur="7.74">this were having this and basically</text>
  <text start="1224.279" dur="4.931">shimek stressed that what makes cyber so</text>

  <text start="1233.529" dur="6.39">might with a storm and basically this</text>
  <text start="1237.009" dur="5.64">last major drill quantum dawn one was</text>
  <text start="1239.919" dur="4.5">conducted in november of 2011 and that</text>

  <text start="1244.419" dur="4.89">attempted physical invasion of wall</text>
  <text start="1246.399" dur="6.21">street exchanges so they are on number</text>
  <text start="1249.309" dur="6.5">two right now and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="1252.609" dur="8.64">see how this plays out and how this</text>
  <text start="1255.809" dur="7.631">cyber attack drill is played out and</text>
  <text start="1261.249" dur="6.841">this is coming on the twenty-eighth</text>
  <text start="1263.44" dur="7.65">which is the week before july 4th which</text>
  <text start="1268.09" dur="5.64">is another warning that we&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="1271.09" dur="6.079">that another false flag might be coming</text>
  <text start="1273.73" dur="6.09">and basically the call to arms for banks</text>
  <text start="1277.169" dur="4.271">and the push this push comes as</text>
  <text start="1279.82" dur="4.38">government officials grow increasingly</text>

  <text start="1286.179" dur="5.85">to the financial systems so to me this</text>
  <text start="1289.84" dur="4.89">is all leading into one thing after</text>
  <text start="1292.029" dur="4.62">another and will this happen during the</text>

  <text start="1311.889" dur="6.211">event now this might be this attack</text>
  <text start="1314.109" dur="6.78">might be just a test for the main event</text>
  <text start="1318.1" dur="4.98">and it might be something where they say</text>
  <text start="1320.889" dur="3.54">oh we were doing a drill or not even</text>
  <text start="1323.08" dur="3.9">mention the drill because they normally</text>
