  <text start="263.36" dur="7.76">no clue what was going on come on</text>
  <text start="267.25" dur="7.87">remember these individuals are audited</text>
  <text start="271.12" dur="7.419">they watch their entire trading system</text>
  <text start="275.12" dur="4.89">very very closely the only way this was</text>

  <text start="291.61" dur="6.72">conspiracy it is a fact</text>
  <text start="296.23" dur="4.41">and believe me this is just the tip of</text>
  <text start="298.33" dur="5.75">the iceberg wait until the Fed is</text>
  <text start="300.64" dur="7.05">audited we&amp;#39;re gonna see all those</text>

  <text start="307.69" dur="4.62">watching right now and we know that</text>
  <text start="310.06" dur="5.75">Trump the Patriots the is administration</text>
  <text start="312.31" dur="8.39">they&amp;#39;re preparing to make an economic</text>
  <text start="315.81" dur="7.39">transition and to do this there are many</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="6.6">things that he needs to accomplish</text>
  <text start="323.2" dur="6.72">before he can actually transition while</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="4.09">fighting the central bank while fighting</text>
  <text start="329.92" dur="4.35">the deep state where they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="331.39" dur="7.44">crash the economic system before he</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="6.87">transitions the economic system and all</text>
  <text start="338.83" dur="4.38">those individuals that are dependent on</text>
  <text start="341.14" dur="5.25">the government well they need to become</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="6.9">independent Trump has been doing this</text>
  <text start="346.39" dur="6.99">he&amp;#39;s been taking millions off of the</text>
  <text start="350.11" dur="6.18">food stamp system but he started to</text>
  <text start="353.38" dur="5.82">realize that it wasn&amp;#39;t just the poor</text>
  <text start="356.29" dur="8.7">that had been on the food stamp system</text>
  <text start="359.2" dur="8.36">it was wealthy individuals now all of</text>
  <text start="364.99" dur="7.14">you are probably saying wait what yes</text>
  <text start="367.56" dur="7.69">millionaires were using food stamps this</text>
  <text start="372.13" dur="6.81">is a very big scam there was a loophole</text>
  <text start="375.25" dur="4.95">in the food stamp program this is also</text>
  <text start="378.94" dur="5.87">known as the Supplemental Nutrition</text>
  <text start="380.2" dur="7.14">Assistance Program or snap and</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="7.63">millionaires are even billionaires they</text>
  <text start="387.34" dur="8.67">were able to receive food stamps so what</text>
  <text start="392.44" dur="7.11">was the loophole well before we get to</text>
  <text start="396.01" dur="5.9">that first an estimated 3.1 million to 5</text>
  <text start="399.55" dur="5.55">million people currently on food stamps</text>
  <text start="401.91" dur="7.03">shouldn&amp;#39;t be receiving this welfare</text>
  <text start="405.1" dur="6.48">benefit now the puzzling policy was born</text>
  <text start="408.94" dur="4.7">out of the 90s welfare reform package</text>
  <text start="411.58" dur="4.41">which was designed to streamline</text>
  <text start="413.64" dur="4.45">efficiency and prevent people from</text>
  <text start="415.99" dur="4.44">having to reapply for multiple welfare</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="5.04">programs the change is stipulated that</text>
  <text start="420.43" dur="4.98">anyone receiving assistance from the</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="5.19">Temporary Assistance for Needy Families</text>
  <text start="425.41" dur="4.44">welfare program was also eligible for</text>
  <text start="428.32" dur="4.02">food stamps</text>
  <text start="429.85" dur="4.29">now of course this made sense and it</text>
  <text start="432.34" dur="4.59">made sense at the time when policymakers</text>
  <text start="434.14" dur="4.86">were laser focused on reducing the</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="3.78">administrative costs of the program and</text>
  <text start="439" dur="6.06">keeping the application process very</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="7.53">easy but now the 90s our way in the past</text>
  <text start="445.06" dur="6.78">and the welfare programs have morphed</text>
  <text start="448.24" dur="7.41">out of control in particular the tamp</text>
  <text start="451.84" dur="7.11">program TANF they&amp;#39;ve been allowed to</text>
  <text start="455.65" dur="6.08">expand to the point that the mere act of</text>
  <text start="458.95" dur="5.73">receiving a brochure a brochure or</text>
  <text start="461.73" dur="7.21">calling a toll-free number funded by a</text>
  <text start="464.68" dur="7.68">tamp program now counts as receiving a</text>
  <text start="468.94" dur="7.14">benefit from temp and since you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.36" dur="6.27">receiving a benefit from tamp citizens</text>
  <text start="476.08" dur="6">automatically are eligible for food</text>
  <text start="478.63" dur="9.23">stamps without any consideration of</text>
  <text start="482.08" dur="9.84">assets this is being done in 36 states</text>
  <text start="487.86" dur="7.66">think about this for a second all these</text>
  <text start="491.92" dur="5.94">years not one individual said you know</text>
  <text start="495.52" dur="6.66">something maybe we should change this</text>
  <text start="497.86" dur="6.39">rule not one hope the Trump</text>
  <text start="502.18" dur="5.82">administration finally looked into it</text>
  <text start="504.25" dur="7.56">and they said well wait a minute this is</text>
  <text start="508" dur="7.5">ridiculous instead why don&amp;#39;t we just</text>
  <text start="511.81" dur="6.419">remove this rule here so what they did</text>
  <text start="515.5" dur="5.52">was they removed the part where it says</text>
  <text start="518.229" dur="6.481">if you place a phone call or receive a</text>
  <text start="521.02" dur="6.69">brochure you&amp;#39;re in the system now all</text>
  <text start="524.71" dur="4.86">these people can&amp;#39;t get food stamps how</text>
  <text start="527.71" dur="4.14">much just by changing this one little</text>
  <text start="529.57" dur="8.3">rule how much did Trump save the</text>
  <text start="531.85" dur="6.02">taxpayers ten billion dollars</text>
  <text start="537.99" dur="6.34">unbelievable now we all know that the</text>
  <text start="541.96" dur="4.71">Fed they&amp;#39;re getting ready to lower rates</text>
  <text start="544.33" dur="5.43">but we have to remember optics are very</text>
  <text start="546.67" dur="5.16">important we know Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="549.76" dur="3.29">continually attack the Fed over and over</text>
  <text start="551.83" dur="3.75">again this will never end</text>
  <text start="553.05" dur="6.13">actually the tap the attacks will</text>
  <text start="555.58" dur="5.91">intensify he wants to make the Fed</text>
  <text start="559.18" dur="6.599">completely obsolete</text>
  <text start="561.49" dur="5.7">and the Fed is going to go and say oh we</text>
  <text start="565.779" dur="3.12">looked at the indicators we looked at</text>
  <text start="567.19" dur="3.959">the numbers we did all the calculations</text>
  <text start="568.899" dur="5.94">and guess what we can lower the rates</text>
  <text start="571.149" dur="7.431">now and Trump he&amp;#39;s continually pushing</text>
  <text start="574.839" dur="7.051">the Fed to make them lower the rates and</text>
  <text start="578.58" dur="5.02">the Fed has to look like they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="581.89" dur="3.27">calculations they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="583.6" dur="4.41">economy they&amp;#39;re looking at the numbers</text>
  <text start="585.16" dur="4.739">even though it&amp;#39;s all fake once they do</text>
  <text start="588.01" dur="4.019">this they will go ahead and they will</text>
  <text start="589.899" dur="4.491">lower the rates and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="592.029" dur="5.101">this Trump tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="594.39" dur="4.33">producer prices in China shrank most in</text>
  <text start="597.13" dur="4.29">three years due to China&amp;#39;s big</text>

  <text start="641.26" dur="6.03">happened in Saudi Arabia we need a</text>
  <text start="643.93" dur="6.06">little help here and don&amp;#39;t worry the Fed</text>
  <text start="647.29" dur="4.2">is going to do this but Trump is making</text>
  <text start="649.99" dur="3.93">sure that everyone knows that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="651.49" dur="4.77">worthless and if the economy implodes</text>
  <text start="653.92" dur="5.609">guess what it&amp;#39;s their fault it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="656.26" dur="5.97">part of the plan and as we know over the</text>
  <text start="659.529" dur="5.671">weekend Saudi Arabia the processing</text>
  <text start="662.23" dur="5.19">plant they were hit now this was a move</text>
  <text start="665.2" dur="5.97">to force the economy into a recession or</text>
  <text start="667.42" dur="6.27">most likely a worldwide collapse the</text>
  <text start="671.17" dur="5.97">Patriots were already prepared for this</text>
  <text start="673.69" dur="5.459">and the Fed is also getting involved</text>
  <text start="677.14" dur="4.139">calming the situation down and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="679.149" dur="4.801">very interesting the Fed was out there</text>
  <text start="681.279" dur="4.831">saying listen no don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="683.95" dur="6.06">even though the oil market was hit there</text>
  <text start="686.11" dur="7.02">is no sign of recession whatsoever think</text>
  <text start="690.01" dur="4.53">about what just happened since Saudi</text>
  <text start="693.13" dur="4.23">Arabia was hit the deeps</text>
  <text start="694.54" dur="5.1">a major media one of the oil prices to</text>
  <text start="697.36" dur="3.21">spike which means people would pay more</text>
  <text start="699.64" dur="3.18">at the pump</text>
  <text start="700.57" dur="4.74">truckers would have to pay more airlines</text>
  <text start="702.82" dur="4.89">would have to pay more delivery systems</text>
  <text start="705.31" dur="6.72">would have to pay more that means you</text>
  <text start="707.71" dur="7.35">pay more in the stores and remember 70%</text>
  <text start="712.03" dur="5.46">of GDP is made up of spending so people</text>
  <text start="715.06" dur="5.22">would then cut down on spending because</text>
  <text start="717.49" dur="6.68">fuel prices are higher and that affects</text>
  <text start="720.28" dur="7.23">everything and if fuel prices are higher</text>
  <text start="724.17" dur="5.62">we would see people not spending which</text>
  <text start="727.51" dur="4.73">means GDP numbers would go down which</text>
  <text start="729.79" dur="8.16">mean the economy would start to falter</text>
