  <text start="40.82" dur="6.66">episode is the US economy is sinking</text>
  <text start="43.04" dur="6">fast and more QE will not help let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="47.48" dur="4.56">right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="49.04" dur="6.299">financial news now on this Friday we</text>
  <text start="52.04" dur="4.979">normally see the market pushed up into</text>
  <text start="55.339" dur="3.511">the green to make everyone feel good</text>
  <text start="57.019" dur="3.961">going into the weekend well they tried</text>
  <text start="58.85" dur="3.81">their best they got it up to a point</text>
  <text start="60.98" dur="4.139">where they can say okay close enough it</text>
  <text start="62.66" dur="4.77">looks good gold we see is a up a little</text>
  <text start="65.119" dur="5.971">bit hovering around that twelve hundred</text>
  <text start="67.43" dur="5.25">dollar range and we can see from</text>
  <text start="71.09" dur="4.529">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been doing all</text>
  <text start="72.68" dur="5.82">these economic indicators that leading</text>
  <text start="75.619" dur="8.64">up to this point we&amp;#39;ve been seeing the</text>
  <text start="78.5" dur="8.1">economy slowly go from this recovery</text>
  <text start="84.259" dur="5.25">they talked about which never existed</text>
  <text start="86.6" dur="5.4">into a recession into a depression and</text>
  <text start="89.509" dur="7.461">here we are at this point now we have to</text>
  <text start="92" dur="4.97">remember everything that we look at is</text>
  <text start="97.24" dur="7.689">indicators it&amp;#39;s not crystal bowl magic</text>
  <text start="101.42" dur="5.929">it&amp;#39;s not futuretelling we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="104.929" dur="6.81">all the things and tracking everything</text>
  <text start="107.349" dur="7.091">so we have a record of saying yes look</text>
  <text start="111.739" dur="7.531">from the beginning till now the economy</text>
  <text start="114.44" dur="8.7">has been slowly deteriorating until we</text>
  <text start="119.27" dur="5.79">hit this collapse because we saw this</text>
  <text start="123.14" dur="3.929">back in 2008 where they made it believe</text>
  <text start="125.06" dur="4.02">they made it all seem like it just</text>
  <text start="127.069" dur="4.801">happened on that day it was absolutely</text>
  <text start="129.08" dur="6.03">fine until that day which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="131.87" dur="4.68">false so what we&amp;#39;re looking at and this</text>
  <text start="135.11" dur="5.61">has to do with political geopolitical</text>
  <text start="136.55" dur="5.519">and economics we&amp;#39;re looking at all the</text>
  <text start="140.72" dur="4.739">indicators trying to put all the pieces</text>
  <text start="142.069" dur="4.89">together to create a picture of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.459" dur="3.36">really going on here because as we know</text>
  <text start="146.959" dur="4.201">the government continually lies to the</text>
  <text start="148.819" dur="4.5">people and they&amp;#39;ll lie to the very end</text>
  <text start="151.16" dur="5.219">and even when the collapse is here</text>
  <text start="153.319" dur="5.941">they&amp;#39;ll continue to lie now for those</text>
  <text start="156.379" dur="4.89">people that have been following me we</text>
  <text start="159.26" dur="3.24">can honestly say from the economic</text>
  <text start="161.269" dur="3.3">indicators and everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="162.5" dur="4.53">been seeing is it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="164.569" dur="5.4">getting a lot worse and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.03" dur="6">accelerating now you might not agree</text>
  <text start="169.969" dur="4.681">with me because you might think no</text>
  <text start="173.03" dur="3.45">everything is fine because I believe the</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="5.28">government they told me everything is</text>
  <text start="176.48" dur="6.379">fine well you can believe that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.93" dur="6.02">your choice that&amp;#39;s the beauty of freedom</text>
  <text start="182.859" dur="6.85">but what we&amp;#39;ve been looking at is not</text>
  <text start="185.95" dur="7.409">you know something out of the sky these</text>
  <text start="189.709" dur="8.581">are facts these are economic indicators</text>
  <text start="193.359" dur="6.61">not manipulation of statistics and this</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="3.75">is what the government likes to push at</text>
  <text start="199.969" dur="5.49">us they like to close the departments</text>
  <text start="202.04" dur="6.27">that you know that don&amp;#39;t count layoffs</text>
  <text start="205.459" dur="4.911">anymore because it&amp;#39;s not in their budget</text>
  <text start="208.31" dur="4.349">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="210.37" dur="3.729">everything starting to fall apart now if</text>
  <text start="212.659" dur="3.78">you believe the government let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.099" dur="4.98">just use France for instance back in</text>
  <text start="216.439" dur="4.97">2013 president Hollande out was out</text>
  <text start="219.079" dur="5.731">there saying the economy is improving</text>
  <text start="221.409" dur="6.31">everything is fine has anything changed</text>
  <text start="224.81" dur="5.099">since 2013 in France no actually if you</text>
  <text start="227.719" dur="4.2">look at it it&amp;#39;s gotten worse President</text>
  <text start="229.909" dur="4.711">Obama in 2013 was saying the real estate</text>
  <text start="231.919" dur="6.21">market is doing fine and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="5.549">be incredible in the next couple of</text>
  <text start="238.129" dur="5.491">years really the real estate market is</text>
  <text start="240.169" dur="6.69">so incredible right now no it really</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="6.72">isn&amp;#39;t yes in circa certain pockets</text>
  <text start="246.859" dur="7.47">around the country but put your house up</text>
  <text start="250.34" dur="6.48">for sale let me know how it goes and yes</text>
  <text start="254.329" dur="4.71">in those areas you might have a sale but</text>
  <text start="256.82" dur="4.529">guess what in the majority of the</text>
  <text start="259.039" dur="5.431">country people are struggling to sell</text>
  <text start="261.349" dur="7.921">their homes it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="264.47" dur="9.919">harder prices are coming down we see the</text>
  <text start="269.27" dur="7.53">global economy falling apart even</text>
  <text start="274.389" dur="3.491">wealthy individuals are starting to</text>
  <text start="276.8" dur="4.47">scratch their head and say okay</text>
  <text start="277.88" dur="4.95">something&amp;#39;s wrong here it seems maybe</text>
  <text start="281.27" dur="3.899">we&amp;#39;re in a recession or depression at</text>
  <text start="282.83" dur="5.91">this point companies are saying this</text>
  <text start="285.169" dur="5.911">year in 2016 we don&amp;#39;t see sales</text>
  <text start="288.74" dur="5.34">improving and if we were in this</text>
  <text start="291.08" dur="5.73">incredible recovery that the government</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="4.26">has been telling us about why are so</text>
  <text start="296.81" dur="4.35">many retail stores closing</text>
  <text start="298.34" dur="6.81">because recoveries equal closure of</text>
  <text start="301.16" dur="8.18">stores oh recovery equals layoffs of</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="9.019">individuals recovery equals a</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="6.82">manufacturing decline no it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="314.169" dur="4.241">that&amp;#39;s why when you hear all these</text>
  <text start="316.16" dur="4.83">people talk about economic recovery the</text>
  <text start="318.41" dur="4.62">economy&amp;#39;s fine they have no idea what</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="5">they&amp;#39;re talking about they&amp;#39;re listening</text>
  <text start="323.03" dur="6.12">to the government relaying that message</text>
  <text start="325.99" dur="6.67">because they want to believe and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.15" dur="6.019">fine that&amp;#39;s their choice now you can</text>
  <text start="332.66" dur="6.569">either be prepared for what is coming or</text>
  <text start="335.169" dur="6.041">you can go and listen to CNN sm NBC or</text>
  <text start="339.229" dur="4.741">whatever the other stations are and</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="4.29">listen to all the news stories that have</text>
  <text start="343.97" dur="4.98">nothing to do about what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="345.5" dur="6.72">on in the world because what we are</text>
  <text start="348.95" dur="7.08">seeing right now is an acceleration of</text>
  <text start="352.22" dur="7.08">the economy completely dying and falling</text>
  <text start="356.03" dur="6.15">apart the eurozone right now the</text>
  <text start="359.3" dur="6.57">consumer confidence it has plunged the</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="6.27">most since 2012 I mean not only are the</text>
  <text start="365.87" dur="6.47">stocks and the bank bonds collapsing so</text>
  <text start="368.45" dur="9.21">is the European consumer confidence in</text>
  <text start="372.34" dur="8.59">February it dropped to negative 8.8 from</text>
  <text start="377.66" dur="4.86">negative 6.3 in january this was much</text>
  <text start="380.93" dur="3.63">sharper than they thought was going to</text>
  <text start="382.52" dur="5.88">happen and they just can&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="384.56" dur="5.91">why what why our peoples you know not</text>
  <text start="388.4" dur="5.55">believing that the the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="390.47" dur="6.54">fine because their lifestyle has</text>
  <text start="393.95" dur="5.87">completely changed people are losing</text>
  <text start="397.01" dur="6.39">jobs things are getting more expensive</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="5.26">but the core consumer prices has surged</text>
  <text start="403.4" dur="4.23">two-point-three percent month on month</text>
  <text start="405.08" dur="5.64">this is the biggest jump since August of</text>
  <text start="407.63" dur="4.95">2011 and year-on-year it&amp;#39;s up by</text>
  <text start="410.72" dur="5.009">two-point-two percent so what does this</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="5.25">mean well it looks like inflation is</text>
  <text start="415.729" dur="5.071">picking up well inflation has always</text>
  <text start="417.83" dur="5.22">been here it&amp;#39;s just been masked and</text>
  <text start="420.8" dur="4.41">covered up and it&amp;#39;s very easy to do to</text>
  <text start="423.05" dur="4.08">mask inflation especially when you go</text>
  <text start="425.21" dur="3.75">into the supermarket certain products</text>
  <text start="427.13" dur="3.719">you can&amp;#39;t do it like fresh fruit milk</text>
  <text start="428.96" dur="3.12">and things like that it&amp;#39;s much more</text>
  <text start="430.849" dur="3.211">difficult to do but other prod</text>
  <text start="432.08" dur="6.359">you can shrink you can substitute</text>
  <text start="434.06" dur="6.629">ingredients in products and this is what</text>
  <text start="438.439" dur="5.401">they&amp;#39;ve been doing ice cream for</text>
  <text start="440.689" dur="4.771">instance you look for a half gallon what</text>
  <text start="443.84" dur="6.72">they done what they&amp;#39;ve done is they</text>
  <text start="445.46" dur="7.259">shrunk the size of the containers some</text>
  <text start="450.56" dur="4.71">products they&amp;#39;re using different</text>
  <text start="452.719" dur="6.991">ingredients because they&amp;#39;re cheaper it</text>
  <text start="455.27" dur="10.82">kind of masks inflation we see that</text>
  <text start="459.71" dur="9.929">pensions they are in jeopardy right now</text>
  <text start="466.09" dur="8.02">giant pension funds they&amp;#39;re planning to</text>
  <text start="469.639" dur="6.661">cut fifty percent of the benefits now</text>
