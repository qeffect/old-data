  <text start="49.6" dur="6.029">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="52.089" dur="5.641">now out in the South China Sea we see</text>
  <text start="55.629" dur="4.351">the US with all the other countries that</text>
  <text start="57.73" dur="4.62">are in the South China Sea and of course</text>
  <text start="59.98" dur="7.11">the u.s. is pushing the Philippines and</text>
  <text start="62.35" dur="7.71">now Vietnam Australia Japan to complain</text>
  <text start="67.09" dur="6.3">about the Spratly Islands the islands</text>
  <text start="70.06" dur="5.85">that china says is theirs and if we go</text>
  <text start="73.39" dur="4.56">back to nineteen forty seven they drew</text>
  <text start="75.91" dur="4.44">maps at that point in time after World</text>
  <text start="77.95" dur="4.26">War two because most of the countries</text>
  <text start="80.35" dur="4.14">around that area said listen we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="82.21" dur="4.98">care if you take these islands or take</text>
  <text start="84.49" dur="5.61">this type of area you can have them it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="87.19" dur="6.239">not a big deal and the US is out there</text>
  <text start="90.1" dur="5.67">right now after all these years you know</text>
  <text start="93.429" dur="4.351">saying that no this does not belong to</text>
  <text start="95.77" dur="6.09">China and they&amp;#39;re continually selling</text>
  <text start="97.78" dur="6.99">warships flying planes in this area to</text>
  <text start="101.86" dur="6.17">provoke China but we have to look back</text>
  <text start="104.77" dur="6.84">in history and we see that the US has</text>
  <text start="108.03" dur="7.119">done the same thing as China but in a</text>
  <text start="111.61" dur="7.35">different way china after World War two</text>
  <text start="115.149" dur="6.271">they drew out the maps and they showed</text>
  <text start="118.96" dur="6.21">that this is part of China the other</text>
  <text start="121.42" dur="6.69">countries didn&amp;#39;t care and for many many</text>
  <text start="125.17" dur="8.64">years this is how was the US on the</text>
  <text start="128.11" dur="10.5">other hand decided to go and state</text>
  <text start="133.81" dur="7.28">claims of different islands which were</text>
  <text start="138.61" dur="5.629">already claimed by other nations and</text>
  <text start="141.09" dur="6.34">according to declassified CIA documents</text>
  <text start="144.239" dur="9.461">President Woodrow Wilson using the guano</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="9.39">act as cover laid claim to surana Rocca</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="5.6">door in the Western Caribbean and they</text>
  <text start="156.82" dur="6.07">built us lighthouses on these islands</text>
  <text start="159.3" dur="6.67">saying that now they&amp;#39;re part of the US</text>
  <text start="162.89" dur="6.63">and the United States continued</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="9.25">occupying many different islands wake</text>
  <text start="169.52" dur="9.17">Kingman Midway Johnston howlin jarvis</text>
  <text start="175.22" dur="6.12">island and that was all based on nothing</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="5.59">it&amp;#39;s funny when you really look back in</text>
  <text start="181.34" dur="7.55">history and you really look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.28" dur="8.28">going on here you see that the US has</text>
  <text start="188.89" dur="5.64">done everything that they&amp;#39;re telling the</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="5.27">world that china shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="9.16">seems a little hypocritical doesn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="197.83" dur="9.34">now there is a retired or a former US</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="7.2">forces Korea commander and he is out</text>
  <text start="207.17" dur="9.59">there saying that North Korea they could</text>
  <text start="210.89" dur="9.27">collapse anytime and we should expect</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="5.74">North Korea collapse he went on to say</text>
  <text start="220.16" dur="4.89">that first off I believe there will be a</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="4.829">strong provocation strong attacks by</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="5.52">North Korea that could quickly escalate</text>
  <text start="227.329" dur="5.041">into a much bigger conflict and this is</text>
  <text start="230.57" dur="4.77">coming from retired four-star general</text>
  <text start="232.37" dur="4.86">Walter sharp secondly there will be an</text>
  <text start="235.34" dur="3.09">instability in North Korea that I</text>
  <text start="237.23" dur="3.39">believe will lead to the collapse of</text>
  <text start="238.43" dur="7.41">North Korea and much sooner than many of</text>
  <text start="240.62" dur="7.41">us think he also said that it is</text>
  <text start="245.84" dur="7.53">becoming increasingly clear that the</text>
  <text start="248.03" dur="8.25">status quo in North Korea that is not</text>
  <text start="253.37" dur="6.39">sustainable and there are expected</text>
  <text start="256.28" dur="8.79">changes including sudden regime collapse</text>
  <text start="259.76" dur="8.88">or a coup coming up very soon now we</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="10.05">know what the US does we know that the</text>
  <text start="268.64" dur="8.399">US initiates these regime changes and we</text>
  <text start="275.12" dur="4.23">can see right now there might be</text>
  <text start="277.039" dur="5.25">something in the works where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.35" dur="5.85">looking to remove that government and</text>
  <text start="282.289" dur="4.591">place a different government in there or</text>
  <text start="285.2" dur="4.29">there could be something else going on</text>
  <text start="286.88" dur="5.849">altogether where maybe they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="5.16">push some type of armed conflict with</text>
  <text start="292.729" dur="3.921">North Korea and this is a situation that</text>
  <text start="294.65" dur="4.48">we need to watch very very closely</text>
  <text start="296.65" dur="5.25">out in Estonia the Prime Minister has</text>
  <text start="299.13" dur="4.87">called for one NATO battalion to be</text>
  <text start="301.9" dur="4.04">permanently stationed in the Baltic</text>
  <text start="304" dur="4.229">nations instead of having rotations and</text>
  <text start="305.94" dur="4.39">he&amp;#39;s saying that this would help Estonia</text>
  <text start="308.229" dur="6.271">Latvia Lithuania to protect themselves</text>
  <text start="310.33" dur="5.67">from of course Russian aggression and we</text>
  <text start="314.5" dur="3.21">see right now that a lot of military</text>
  <text start="316" dur="5.34">assets are being moved all over the</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="6.54">place and troops are being rotated in</text>
  <text start="321.34" dur="5.04">and out because what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="324.25" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re preparing for what is coming and</text>
  <text start="326.38" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re hoping by doing all of this this</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="5.25">would provoke Russia maybe into doing</text>
  <text start="331.66" dur="5.49">something and they want them to build up</text>
  <text start="333.82" dur="4.68">arms on the other side because this way</text>
  <text start="337.15" dur="3">they can point in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="338.5" dur="4.02">saying look they&amp;#39;re building up armed</text>
  <text start="340.15" dur="6.06">forces but of course it&amp;#39;s inside their</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="6.24">country the US and NATO they&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="346.21" dur="5.07">up arms right outside the border of</text>
  <text start="348.76" dur="5.67">Russia listen if Russia or China was</text>
  <text start="351.28" dur="4.56">doing this in Canada or in Mexico right</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="3.9">up against the border of the United</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="4.32">States the United States government</text>
  <text start="358.33" dur="4.76">would be a little concerned about that</text>
  <text start="360.16" dur="5.93">and this is why Russia is very concerned</text>
  <text start="363.09" dur="7.69">we see out in the Mediterranean</text>
  <text start="366.09" dur="7.359">something weird is happening there three</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="5.54">countries right now in the Mediterranean</text>
  <text start="373.449" dur="5.071">have closed their airspace and</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="5.589">territories for aircraft departing from</text>
  <text start="378.52" dur="6.149">Libya now the exceptions are very few</text>
  <text start="381.909" dur="6.451">and involve transported military and</text>
  <text start="384.669" dur="6.841">evacuate and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="388.36" dur="5.82">is they might be getting ready and</text>
  <text start="391.51" dur="4.8">prepared for some type of an offensive</text>
  <text start="394.18" dur="5.549">in there now we see Greece Malta and</text>
  <text start="396.31" dur="6">Italy and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised is if</text>
  <text start="399.729" dur="5.31">more of these countries decide to close</text>
  <text start="402.31" dur="4.71">the airspace so they don&amp;#39;t have air</text>
  <text start="405.039" dur="3.511">traffic going in and out and this way</text>
  <text start="407.02" dur="4.26">they can bring in the Bombers they can</text>
  <text start="408.55" dur="7.399">bring in whatever they need to go into</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="8.04">Libya now the closures they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="415.949" dur="8.411">today or yesterday and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="419.32" dur="6.81">into August now remember there are a</text>
  <text start="424.36" dur="5.549">couple drills going on we have Phoenix</text>
  <text start="426.13" dur="4.279">2016 which ends may 27th but right after</text>
  <text start="429.909" dur="3.86">that</text>
  <text start="430.409" dur="7.01">we have to NATO refueling exercises</text>
  <text start="433.769" dur="8.66">which will take place in this area and</text>
  <text start="437.419" dur="8.65">this is going to go from the end of May</text>
  <text start="442.429" dur="6.13">to June July and then there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="446.069" dur="4.05">one right after that so this is a very</text>
  <text start="448.559" dur="6.72">interesting thing that&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="450.119" dur="8.76">now and we know that Congress leaves in</text>
  <text start="455.279" dur="6.6">August we know Obama has Washington all</text>
  <text start="458.879" dur="6.06">to himself we know from past history</text>
  <text start="461.879" dur="9.29">this is when they like to push some type</text>
  <text start="464.939" dur="8.88">of event offensive military exercise</text>
  <text start="471.169" dur="4.66">because we&amp;#39;ve seen it in the past and I</text>
  <text start="473.819" dur="4.14">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised at this point</text>
  <text start="475.829" dur="4.2">right now that this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="477.959" dur="3.93">preparing for and everything is getting</text>
  <text start="480.029" dur="5.34">ready we&amp;#39;re at the end of May right now</text>
  <text start="481.889" dur="8.01">we&amp;#39;re going into June and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="485.369" dur="9.181">closer and closer to that point now we</text>
  <text start="489.899" dur="6.901">see out in Syria Russia has destroyed</text>
  <text start="494.55" dur="6.089">the Islamic state headquarters in</text>
  <text start="496.8" dur="8.31">northern Palmyra and there&amp;#39;s a battle</text>
  <text start="500.639" dur="8.07">going on in Palmyra and Aleppo and Rocca</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="7.469">and the u.s. is not coordinating any of</text>
  <text start="508.709" dur="6.421">this with Russia whatsoever they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="512.579" dur="5.76">even want to be involved because we know</text>
  <text start="515.13" dur="6.12">what&amp;#39;s happening and we know that al</text>
  <text start="518.339" dur="4.98">Qaeda al-nusrah the Islamic state there</text>
  <text start="521.25" dur="4.29">are US forces intertwined in these</text>
  <text start="523.319" dur="3.901">groups because these are the proxy</text>
  <text start="525.54" dur="4.169">forces of the United States the</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="4.559">coalition forces and they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="529.709" dur="3.3">after these forces they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="531.779" dur="4.651">the infrastructure they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="533.009" dur="5.041">assad troops they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="536.43" dur="4.159">everything but what they say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.05" dur="5.88">going after we see the Syrian opposition</text>
  <text start="540.589" dur="7.091">they have repeatedly struct a hospital</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="6.12">with rockets and they know this area is</text>
  <text start="547.68" dur="3.99">filled with civilians but again they</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t care remember these are paid</text>
  <text start="551.67" dur="4.68">mercenaries these are terrorists they</text>
  <text start="554.61" dur="8.13">don&amp;#39;t care about the people in the</text>
  <text start="556.35" dur="7.56">country now the Syrian opposition they</text>
  <text start="562.74" dur="3.48">want Germany</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="4.83">to join the peace talks they&amp;#39;re feeling</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="4.62">that if Germany was there they can speak</text>
  <text start="568.74" dur="5.88">to Russia they can have Assad removed</text>
  <text start="570.84" dur="6.72">and everything will be okay well right</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="4.74">now there are no syria talks for about</text>
  <text start="577.56" dur="4.83">two to three weeks right now this is</text>
  <text start="579.36" dur="7.56">coming from the UN so there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="582.39" dur="8.16">scheduled at this point we see a UK</text>
  <text start="586.92" dur="8.31">general he is out there and he is saying</text>
  <text start="590.55" dur="6.9">that Al qaeda-linked extremists are much</text>
  <text start="595.23" dur="4.38">more dangerous now than the Islamic</text>
  <text start="597.45" dur="4.5">state well the Islamic state is being</text>
  <text start="599.61" dur="3.6">wiped out by Russia a lot of these</text>
  <text start="601.95" dur="3.72">terrorists are being moved over to</text>
  <text start="603.21" dur="5.01">al-qaeda back into al Qaeda back into</text>
  <text start="605.67" dur="5.7">al-nusrah back into the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="608.22" dur="6.41">and they&amp;#39;re building up forces of al</text>
  <text start="611.37" dur="6.93">Qaeda and the other terrorist groups and</text>
  <text start="614.63" dur="5.74">Lieutenant General Mark Carlton Smith is</text>
  <text start="618.3" dur="4.44">saying that the illness were front is</text>
  <text start="620.37" dur="5.82">the strongest remaining al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="622.74" dur="6.35">franchise and he&amp;#39;s very worried because</text>
  <text start="626.19" dur="7.44">there could be some type of attacks</text>
  <text start="629.09" dur="8.08">happening in the west by this group now</text>
  <text start="633.63" dur="5.91">what&amp;#39;s happening here is they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="637.17" dur="3.66">the edge with the Islamic state so now</text>
  <text start="639.54" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re switching over to al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="640.83" dur="4.89">al-nusrah to show that okay now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="643.83" dur="4.47">the strongest group now they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="645.72" dur="4.67">over in Syria they&amp;#39;re creating a</text>
  <text start="648.3" dur="4.59">Caliphate just like the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="650.39" dur="5.89">because you have to remember Russia has</text>
  <text start="652.89" dur="6.53">drawn down the forces from 80,000 all</text>
  <text start="656.28" dur="6.06">the way down to like 50 1000 and</text>
  <text start="659.42" dur="4.57">Counting and it&amp;#39;s shrinking getting</text>
  <text start="662.34" dur="4.17">smaller and smaller and smaller and</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re on the run and they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="666.51" dur="5.61">their advantage and this is why the US</text>
  <text start="670.41" dur="3.69">is bringing in Special Op teams this is</text>
  <text start="672.12" dur="3.3">why they&amp;#39;re bringing in al Qaeda this is</text>
  <text start="674.1" dur="4.62">why they&amp;#39;re bringing in other terrorist</text>
  <text start="675.42" dur="6.21">groups to morph them into the moderate</text>
  <text start="678.72" dur="6.06">rebels back into al Qaeda so Russia</text>
  <text start="681.63" dur="4.38">doesn&amp;#39;t go after them because what</text>
  <text start="684.78" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re really preparing for is</text>
  <text start="686.01" dur="7.89">something major in August we can see all</text>
  <text start="691.05" dur="5.19">the signs we see they&amp;#39;re bringing in</text>
  <text start="693.9" dur="3.479">more and more military assets we see al</text>
  <text start="696.24" dur="4.409">Qaeda there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="697.379" dur="5.22">six thousand troops near Aleppo now we</text>
  <text start="700.649" dur="5.43">see air bases being built in all these</text>
  <text start="702.599" dur="5.13">countries over the Mediterranean three</text>
  <text start="706.079" dur="5.07">countries are already closing their</text>
  <text start="707.729" dur="7.55">airspace to Libya so we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="711.149" dur="7.321">see signs that more and more of this is</text>
  <text start="715.279" dur="6.79">occurring as we get closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="718.47" dur="5.509">August which shows us that something big</text>
  <text start="722.069" dur="4.5">is about to happen in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="723.979" dur="4.69">now they might start different parts of</text>
  <text start="726.569" dur="4.77">it at different times maybe this weekend</text>
  <text start="728.669" dur="5.16">we might see something happen in Libya</text>
  <text start="731.339" dur="5.42">going down the line as they&amp;#39;re preparing</text>
  <text start="733.829" dur="6.21">for Syria that might happen in August</text>
