  <text start="39.96" dur="4.2">saturday now we understand here in the</text>
  <text start="42.239" dur="3.421">united states that the housing market is</text>
  <text start="44.16" dur="3.239">starting to fall apart of course the</text>
  <text start="45.66" dur="3.809">corporate media is out there telling</text>
  <text start="47.399" dur="4.111">everyone that everything is improving</text>
  <text start="49.469" dur="4.441">everything is getting better everything</text>
  <text start="51.51" dur="4.5">looks fantastic well here is some more</text>
  <text start="53.91" dur="4.739">evidence that we are running into major</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="6.75">major problems here and once we come out</text>
  <text start="58.649" dur="6.811">of this summer time push for real estate</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="4.83">to go up which really didn&amp;#39;t happen the</text>
  <text start="65.46" dur="4.02">way they economist thought it was going</text>
  <text start="67.59" dur="3.599">to happen yeah we had a little bump but</text>
  <text start="69.48" dur="2.819">it wasn&amp;#39;t as great as they thought it</text>
  <text start="71.189" dur="2.61">was going to be a network coming out of</text>
  <text start="72.299" dur="4.231">the summer heading into the winter and</text>
  <text start="73.799" dur="4.231">fall and winter and it&amp;#39;s going to start</text>
  <text start="76.53" dur="4.949">to drop its going to start falling apart</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="7.699">but one good indicator is those people</text>
  <text start="81.479" dur="7.111">who flip homes now reality track is</text>
  <text start="85.729" dur="5.471">reporting that on the second quarter of</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="5.19">2014 fewer than 31,000 single-family</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="5.279">homes were flipped across the u.s. down</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="4.619">from five point nine percent share in</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="4.17">the first quarter and down from six</text>
  <text start="98.399" dur="5.341">point two percent share in the 2nd</text>
  <text start="100.649" dur="5.43">quarter of 2013 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="5.489">the single-family home sales overall</text>
  <text start="106.079" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re already down from last year when</text>
  <text start="109.229" dur="3.301">the home prices drop of course the</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="4.171">flippers don&amp;#39;t have that profit in the</text>
  <text start="112.53" dur="6.03">home and it&amp;#39;s taking longer and longer</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="5.609">to sell the homes and this does not work</text>
  <text start="118.56" dur="5.339">out for the flipper so right now what</text>
  <text start="120.719" dur="8.311">we&amp;#39;re seeing is the volume of flips they</text>
  <text start="123.899" dur="7.051">have plunged 61 percent from a year ago</text>
  <text start="129.03" dur="4.56">according to the flipping report now if</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="5.16">we take a look at the graph us home</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="5.13">flipping historical activity and I have</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="4.17">it on the side here we see we reached</text>
  <text start="138.72" dur="4.68">the peak</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="7.08">homes being flipped in the fourth</text>
  <text start="143.4" dur="7.35">quarter of 2012 and since that time we</text>
  <text start="147.36" dur="5.61">have dropped now we had a bounce a like</text>
  <text start="150.75" dur="7.41">like a dead cow bounce a dead cat bounce</text>
  <text start="152.97" dur="9.06">in the fourth quarter of 2013 and since</text>
  <text start="158.16" dur="7.43">that time we have been coming down again</text>
  <text start="162.03" dur="6.48">so it looks like we had a huge increase</text>
  <text start="165.59" dur="5.35">from the third quarter of 2012 like I</text>
  <text start="168.51" dur="5.58">just shot up to the fourth quarter of</text>
  <text start="170.94" dur="5.07">2012 and then all of a sudden we came</text>
  <text start="174.09" dur="3.27">down we had a dead cat bounce and now</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re heading down again and we can see</text>
  <text start="177.36" dur="4.14">from all the evidence we are going to be</text>
  <text start="180.12" dur="3.18">heading straight down and this is a</text>
  <text start="181.5" dur="4.11">really good indicator to show that</text>
  <text start="183.3" dur="3.689">people are not flipping like they did</text>
  <text start="185.61" dur="3.599">because it&amp;#39;s taking longer and longer</text>
  <text start="186.989" dur="4.5">for homes to sell and I&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="189.209" dur="4.771">across the u.s. and yes I am saying i</text>
  <text start="191.489" dur="5.28">mentioned this before i am seeing homes</text>
  <text start="193.98" dur="6.15">where they have been on the market 60 90</text>
  <text start="196.769" dur="5.431">120 days the prices are leveling off and</text>
  <text start="200.13" dur="4.919">in a lot of places prices are falling</text>
  <text start="202.2" dur="7.349">yes prices are still going up in certain</text>
  <text start="205.049" dur="6.991">key locations but this will soon start</text>
  <text start="209.549" dur="4.801">to level off and start to come up come</text>
  <text start="212.04" dur="5.25">down just like we saw back in two</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="5.19">thousand six going into 2007 and then</text>
  <text start="217.29" dur="5.94">eventually into 2008 where homes</text>
  <text start="219.54" dur="5.99">completely crashed now we all understand</text>
  <text start="223.23" dur="4.92">and I think we&amp;#39;re all pretty much</text>
  <text start="225.53" dur="6.85">understanding that something happened</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="6.209">with the mh17 crash it was taken down by</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="4.53">something and it wasn&amp;#39;t the Russians</text>
  <text start="234.359" dur="6.051">pretty much we kind of know that right</text>
  <text start="236.91" dur="5.639">now and this kind of really proves that</text>
  <text start="240.41" dur="4.72">something is being hidden from the</text>
  <text start="242.549" dur="4.651">public in the framework of the four</text>
  <text start="245.13" dur="4.26">country agreements signed on august</text>
  <text start="247.2" dur="5.039">eighth between ukraine netherlands</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="4.29">belgium and australia information on the</text>
  <text start="252.239" dur="3.181">progress and results of the</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="6.21">investigation of the disaster will</text>
  <text start="255.42" dur="6.629">remain classified this was confirmed at</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="4.92">a briefing in kiev under the auspices of</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="4.68">the office of the prosecutor general the</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="4.02">results of the investigation will be</text>
  <text start="266.729" dur="4.801">published once completed only if a</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="4.35">consensus agreement of all parties that</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="5.49">have signed the agreement prevail</text>
  <text start="273.18" dur="6.12">any one of the signatories has the right</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="4.58">to veto the publication of the results</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="5.64">of the investigation without explanation</text>
  <text start="281.6" dur="4.84">hmm do you think Ukraine is going to</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="3.78">veto and say we don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="286.44" dur="4.199">information out there absolutely</text>
  <text start="288.72" dur="3.24">probably most of the other countries too</text>
  <text start="290.639" dur="3.961">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="291.96" dur="4.679">they&amp;#39;re keeping it classified they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="294.6" dur="4.26">want the real information out there and</text>
  <text start="296.639" dur="4.441">there has to be a consensus among all</text>
  <text start="298.86" dur="5.07">these countries and guess what most</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="5.91">likely this is never going to happen the</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="5.579">information will stay classified and we</text>
  <text start="306.99" dur="7.08">can see right now this is a complete</text>
  <text start="309.509" dur="7.621">cover up now Kiev is out there and</text>
  <text start="314.07" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re saying that listen we were going</text>
  <text start="317.13" dur="5.129">for the ceasefire and you know because</text>
  <text start="319.56" dur="4.5">yesterday I told you that russia wants a</text>
  <text start="322.259" dur="3.211">ceasefire they going to the UN Security</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="3.359">Council looking to get a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="325.47" dur="3.84">hoping the United States doesn&amp;#39;t veto it</text>
  <text start="327.419" dur="4.801">and Ukraine saying they were going to go</text>
  <text start="329.31" dur="6.78">along with the ceasefire but now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="6.72">stepping back because the convoy should</text>
  <text start="336.09" dur="4.949">have been duly registered and it looks</text>
  <text start="338.94" dur="4.83">like you know even though the paperwork</text>
  <text start="341.039" dur="5.041">and everything was in order and Kiev was</text>
  <text start="343.77" dur="4.59">continually stalling probably to have</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="4.559">all the food spoiled so when it reached</text>
  <text start="348.36" dur="5.01">the people in Logans they would get</text>
  <text start="350.639" dur="4.951">spoiled food and and you could just tell</text>
  <text start="353.37" dur="4.26">they were continually stalling to get</text>
  <text start="355.59" dur="3.359">this humanitarian aid in and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.63" dur="3.509">saying that you know what because of</text>
  <text start="358.949" dur="3.271">what happened here we don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="361.139" dur="5.191">we&amp;#39;re going to go along with the</text>
  <text start="362.22" dur="5.91">ceasefire we might not actually vote for</text>
  <text start="366.33" dur="4.2">one and we could see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="368.13" dur="4.409">trying to wiggle out of this they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="4.379">want to cease fire basically what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.539" dur="4.591">happening is they are under the control</text>
  <text start="374.909" dur="5.07">of the central banking system US</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="5.879">government their orders are to take back</text>
  <text start="379.979" dur="5.91">the southeastern area of Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="383.009" dur="4.891">then move into Crimea during the same</text>
  <text start="385.889" dur="6.03">time they&amp;#39;re going to provoke provoke</text>
  <text start="387.9" dur="5.509">provoke Russia continually non-stop and</text>
  <text start="391.919" dur="4.53">of course they&amp;#39;re going to come out with</text>
  <text start="393.409" dur="5.431">propaganda to say that Russia&amp;#39;s invading</text>
  <text start="396.449" dur="5.071">Russia is shelling inside of Ukraine</text>
  <text start="398.84" dur="3.819">Russia&amp;#39;s flying planes and bombing I</text>
  <text start="401.52" dur="3">mean they&amp;#39;ll come up with pretty much</text>
  <text start="402.659" dur="3.611">everything but of course every time they</text>
  <text start="404.52" dur="5.53">say this they never</text>
  <text start="406.27" dur="8.1">resent any proof whatsoever now that</text>
  <text start="410.05" dur="7.26">humanitarian aid is the whole convoy is</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="5.1">now coming back to Russia everything was</text>
  <text start="417.31" dur="4.86">dropped off and the trucks are returning</text>
  <text start="419.47" dur="4.14">to Russia now we understand out in China</text>
  <text start="422.17" dur="4.41">this is another place where the United</text>
  <text start="423.61" dur="4.62">States is continually provoking and if</text>
  <text start="426.58" dur="5.46">you really look at this provoking in</text>
  <text start="428.23" dur="5.97">Ukraine provoking in China provoking in</text>
  <text start="432.04" dur="5.58">the Middle East I mean it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="434.2" dur="5.64">unbelievable here the United States is</text>
  <text start="437.62" dur="6.44">saying that the Chinese war plane flew</text>
  <text start="439.84" dur="4.22">very close to a United States</text>
  <text start="444.24" dur="4.9">surveillance jet and they show the</text>
  <text start="447.16" dur="4.26">underbelly and it was very provocative</text>
  <text start="449.14" dur="6.12">and of course what they&amp;#39;re not telling</text>
  <text start="451.42" dur="6.5">you is the surveillance jet flew into</text>
  <text start="455.26" dur="5.42">this area got very close to China and</text>
  <text start="457.92" dur="6.16">when you&amp;#39;re in the international area</text>
  <text start="460.68" dur="6.97">the Chinese decided to send up a fighter</text>
  <text start="464.08" dur="6.21">flight towards the plane to identify it</text>
  <text start="467.65" dur="3.99">and of course now the propaganda is</text>
  <text start="470.29" dur="3.33">coming out because what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="471.64" dur="4.41">to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to provoke and</text>
  <text start="473.62" dur="5.49">the Chinese Defense Minister on Saturday</text>

  <text start="524.32" dur="3.69">between the two sides on air and marine</text>
  <text start="526.24" dur="4.35">security issues now we can see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.01" dur="4.35">happening we see the propaganda coming</text>
  <text start="530.59" dur="3.39">out in Ukraine where they&amp;#39;re continually</text>

  <text start="550.149" dur="6.911">encircling China now since this incident</text>
  <text start="554.29" dur="4.78">that just occurred where the United</text>

  <text start="605.089" dur="3.981">going to see this accelerate as time</text>

  <text start="617.39" dur="2.97">the United States government wanted</text>
  <text start="618.62" dur="3.089">because they weren&amp;#39;t really dealing with</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="2.94">the united states that in sign that</text>
  <text start="621.709" dur="4.171">bilateral support agreement where the</text>
  <text start="623.3" dur="5.729">troops can go into Iraq and this is why</text>
  <text start="625.88" dur="4.92">the troops were actually removed from</text>
  <text start="629.029" dur="3.151">Iraq because they wouldn&amp;#39;t sign the</text>
  <text start="630.8" dur="4.65">agreement the same things happening in</text>
  <text start="632.18" dur="5.19">Afghanistan President Karzai would not</text>

  <text start="694.91" dur="5.31">happening to Libya Lebanon and Iraq</text>
  <text start="697.58" dur="4.35">maybe they are becoming very very</text>
  <text start="700.22" dur="4.68">concerned about what&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="701.93" dur="6.42">Middle East now we understand and an</text>
  <text start="704.9" dur="6.18">unidentified Fighter Group fired and</text>
  <text start="708.35" dur="4.8">bombed Libya in the city of Tripoli and</text>
  <text start="711.08" dur="3.69">of course some of the fragments were</text>
  <text start="713.15" dur="2.94">pointing back to the US and it would be</text>
  <text start="714.77" dur="3.42">very easy for them to do this because</text>
  <text start="716.09" dur="4.59">all they&amp;#39;d have to do is take one of the</text>
  <text start="718.19" dur="3.9">fighter jets on the aircraft&amp;#39;s that are</text>
  <text start="720.68" dur="3.36">right out there in the Mediterranean</text>
  <text start="722.09" dur="4.38">flight right into Libya it would be no</text>
  <text start="724.04" dur="5.22">problem whatsoever and now we are having</text>
  <text start="726.47" dur="6.51">reports that another identified warplane</text>
  <text start="729.26" dur="5.88">attack Tripoli again now identified</text>
  <text start="732.98" dur="4.83">warplanes attack positions of an armed</text>
  <text start="735.14" dur="4.2">faction in Libyan capital residents</text>
  <text start="737.81" dur="3.78">heard loud explosions early in the</text>
  <text start="739.34" dur="4.53">morning near the main airport so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="741.59" dur="4.86">continually seeing this happen over and</text>
  <text start="743.87" dur="5.46">over again and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="746.45" dur="5.22">if the u.s. is just flying in bombing</text>
  <text start="749.33" dur="4.44">and leaving because they have all the</text>
  <text start="751.67" dur="4.95">equipment right there ready to go and</text>
  <text start="753.77" dur="5.1">this is what they&amp;#39;re what they need to</text>
  <text start="756.62" dur="4.53">do because the tribes are rising rising</text>
  <text start="758.87" dur="3.66">up there trying to push them back having</text>
  <text start="761.15" dur="3.51">the same problem in all the other Middle</text>
  <text start="762.53" dur="3.6">Eastern countries and it is really</text>
  <text start="764.66" dur="3.09">getting out of hand and this is why</text>
  <text start="766.13" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re seeing everything escalate right</text>
  <text start="767.75" dur="4.8">now because they realize they&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="770.09" dur="5.46">out of time they need to push this</text>
  <text start="772.55" dur="5.61">agenda forward they need war they need</text>
  <text start="775.55" dur="6.33">to do something to get troops in this</text>
  <text start="778.16" dur="5.18">area now it looks like the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="781.88" dur="5.52">control by the United States is</text>
  <text start="783.34" dur="5.83">completely forming their own petrol type</text>
  <text start="787.4" dur="4.05">of state because what they they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="789.17" dur="3.72">captured a couple oil fields in Syria</text>
  <text start="791.45" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re using this they&amp;#39;re selling it on</text>
  <text start="792.89" dur="3.9">the black market of course the United</text>
  <text start="794.66" dur="4.32">States says absolutely nothing nothing</text>
  <text start="796.79" dur="3.71">about them selling the oil nothing about</text>
  <text start="798.98" dur="4.08">them selling it on the black market</text>
  <text start="800.5" dur="4.12">absolutely nothing why because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="803.06" dur="3.63">controlling the situation they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="804.62" dur="4.05">to set up this whole</text>
  <text start="806.69" dur="4.44">system where the Islamic state can</text>
  <text start="808.67" dur="4.59">profit from it they&amp;#39;re selling it using</text>
  <text start="811.13" dur="4.35">the dollar on the black market so they</text>
  <text start="813.26" dur="3.63">are completely fine with this because</text>
  <text start="815.48" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re controlling what is going on</text>
  <text start="816.89" dur="5.67">believe me if it was a real terrorist</text>
  <text start="819.41" dur="5.88">group selling the oil not using the</text>
  <text start="822.56" dur="5.22">dollar we would see action like you</text>
  <text start="825.29" dur="5.97">wouldn&amp;#39;t believe look what happened in</text>
  <text start="827.78" dur="4.8">Libya the tribes of Libya not controlled</text>
  <text start="831.26" dur="6.39">by the United States government central</text>
  <text start="832.58" dur="7.95">Baker&amp;#39;s took oil put it on a ship set</text>
  <text start="837.65" dur="6.84">sail they were going to sell it what</text>
  <text start="840.53" dur="7.38">happened Navy SEALs boarded the tanker</text>
  <text start="844.49" dur="6.21">brought it right back wouldn&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="847.91" dur="6.72">this to happen now why would they do</text>
  <text start="850.7" dur="6.12">that in Libya but not here in Iraq why</text>
  <text start="854.63" dur="4.56">and why wouldn&amp;#39;t they be screaming and</text>
  <text start="856.82" dur="3.99">yelling about it because they are under</text>
  <text start="859.19" dur="4.5">their control they&amp;#39;re doing exactly what</text>
  <text start="860.81" dur="5.52">they want them to do the tribes in Libya</text>
  <text start="863.69" dur="5.16">are uncontrolled not part of the system</text>
  <text start="866.33" dur="5.13">and they said absolutely not we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="868.85" dur="5.94">letting this happen now it looks like</text>
  <text start="871.46" dur="6.06">the UN is calling out for the</text>
  <text start="874.79" dur="6.51">international community to help another</text>
  <text start="877.52" dur="5.79">town in Iraq this one is called amarilla</text>
  <text start="881.3" dur="4.14">and they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="883.31" dur="4.35">run over by the Islamic state people are</text>
  <text start="885.44" dur="4.65">suffering so we might see coals for this</text>
  <text start="887.66" dur="3.39">coming up very soon by the United States</text>
  <text start="890.09" dur="3.03">saying that they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="891.05" dur="3.3">bomb this area and what this probably</text>
  <text start="893.12" dur="3.69">really means is that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="894.35" dur="4.65">protect certain other oil elements from</text>
  <text start="896.81" dur="4.35">the tribes of Iraq rising up and not</text>
  <text start="899" dur="4.38">really bombing the Islamic state like</text>
  <text start="901.16" dur="5.55">they say they do now it seems like there</text>
  <text start="903.38" dur="7.17">was a huge cyber attack on department of</text>
  <text start="906.71" dur="6.45">homeland security about 25 in 25,000</text>
  <text start="910.55" dur="4.83">internal records were breached and</text>
  <text start="913.16" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re saying this is coming from an</text>
  <text start="915.38" dur="5.43">outside actor a state-sponsored actor</text>
  <text start="918.83" dur="3.75">from a foreign government and right now</text>
  <text start="920.81" dur="4.46">they&amp;#39;re looking into it they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="922.58" dur="4.95">to really name the state-sponsored</text>
  <text start="925.27" dur="3.58">foreign government just yet because they</text>
  <text start="927.53" dur="3.84">have to investigate a little bit further</text>
  <text start="928.85" dur="4.98">but it looks like they talk they took a</text>
  <text start="931.37" dur="3.93">lot of information allegedly and it</text>
  <text start="933.83" dur="4.02">seems like what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="935.3" dur="5.039">is they&amp;#39;re really playing this up most</text>
  <text start="937.85" dur="5.279">likely it will be either the</text>
  <text start="940.339" dur="4.74">Syrian electronic army China or Russia</text>
  <text start="943.129" dur="4.62">who&amp;#39;s done this and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="945.079" dur="4.651">going to use this to push the agenda and</text>
  <text start="947.749" dur="5.58">demonize these countries because there</text>
  <text start="949.73" dur="4.979">has to be a bad guide during this war so</text>
