  <text start="116.7" dur="3.299">discrepancies we see things that really</text>
  <text start="118.799" dur="2.7">don&amp;#39;t make sense and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="119.999" dur="4.711">discussing all of these things that</text>
  <text start="121.499" dur="8.04">don&amp;#39;t make sense and a lot of it is</text>
  <text start="124.71" dur="8.609">flashing red lights at us letting us</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="7.771">know that the economy is not headed in</text>
  <text start="133.319" dur="6.661">the right direction and we&amp;#39;ve seen six</text>
  <text start="137.31" dur="6.06">out of six fed regional feds come up and</text>
  <text start="139.98" dur="5.07">say yes things are not looking good we</text>
  <text start="143.37" dur="7.13">looked at retail we looked at</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="9.9">unemployment we looked at home sales and</text>
  <text start="150.5" dur="6.819">all of it is pointing to an economy that</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="5.34">is in a major major to climb right now</text>
  <text start="157.319" dur="6.121">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that wholesale</text>
  <text start="160.29" dur="5.7">inventories they rose by 0.1%</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="4.92">month-on-month and this was more than</text>
  <text start="165.99" dur="4.5">they expected in the most in seven</text>
  <text start="168.36" dur="4.47">months and while this was happening</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="7.35">where inventories were building up sales</text>
  <text start="172.83" dur="7.05">dropped by 1% month on month now this</text>
  <text start="177.84" dur="7.08">just sent the inventory to sales ratio</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="8.22">to a 1.31 new cycle hi and this is</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="7.35">flashing once again signs of a recession</text>
  <text start="188.1" dur="6.51">/ depression now with inventories up by</text>
  <text start="192.27" dur="4.59">four point two percent year-on-year and</text>
  <text start="194.61" dur="6.12">sales are down by four point five</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="7.53">percent year-on-year basically what</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re seeing is the sales aren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="3.48">to buy up the supplies that are in</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="5.01">inventory and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="6.36">continually build up and this is a major</text>
  <text start="211.62" dur="8.37">problem now we know manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="10.44">down we know sales are down in stores</text>
  <text start="219.99" dur="6.06">and we see the Baltic Dry Index which is</text>
  <text start="224.67" dur="6.09">the raw material that they use in</text>
  <text start="226.05" dur="6.6">factories is also down and it&amp;#39;s down to</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="3.36">eight hundred and nine points now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.65" dur="3.96">very interesting about this I went back</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="4.02">to last year at this time and we have it</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="4.17">we had an average about eleven hundred</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="4.53">points or so during this time I went to</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="4.97">the year previous to this and it was</text>
  <text start="242.67" dur="8.67">around 1400 points at this time and this</text>
  <text start="245.75" dur="9.97">is continually falling but what we see</text>
  <text start="251.34" dur="6.6">here is a complete decline of our</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="3.87">economy now a lot of people are looking</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="5.64">at it they&amp;#39;re saying no everything looks</text>
  <text start="259.59" dur="6">fine to me everything seems great until</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="3.18">you look closer and closer of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="265.59" dur="3.24">really happening I&amp;#39;ve been driving</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="4.65">around and I see a lot of strip malls</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="7.08">that are completely empty I see a lot of</text>
  <text start="271.41" dur="6.45">moles that have missing stores and what</text>
  <text start="275.91" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re seeing here is people think that</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="3.809">the economy is doing better because gas</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="5.31">prices are coming down the stock market</text>
  <text start="281.669" dur="5.161">is holding steady at this point yes</text>
  <text start="284.64" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;ve seen the fluctuations but in their</text>
  <text start="286.83" dur="4.47">minds they&amp;#39;re not seeing anything of</text>
  <text start="289.05" dur="4.46">course those people who are getting laid</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="5.37">off you know the tens of thousands in</text>
  <text start="293.51" dur="4.41">the last couple of weeks there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.67" dur="4.89">being a completely different picture</text>
  <text start="297.92" dur="6.7">especially the 750,000 going back to</text>
  <text start="301.56" dur="5.28">last year but we see something very</text>
  <text start="304.62" dur="6.57">interesting buried in the Fed minutes</text>
  <text start="306.84" dur="8.82">and they downgraded the US economy once</text>
  <text start="311.19" dur="6.84">again and they&amp;#39;re looking at this and</text>
  <text start="315.66" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re puzzled by what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="318.03" dur="3.45">because they thought if they created all</text>
  <text start="319.26" dur="4.02">these bubbles everything would just work</text>
  <text start="321.48" dur="5.82">out people will just take the money from</text>
  <text start="323.28" dur="8.01">their pockets and spend it and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="6.48">seeing that you know the entire growth</text>
  <text start="331.29" dur="5.16">of the economy is based on population</text>
  <text start="333.78" dur="7.11">and productivity while they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="336.45" dur="6.84">in more and more illegals to help boost</text>
  <text start="340.89" dur="5.82">the population problem to bring in more</text>
  <text start="343.29" dur="5.6">people and they&amp;#39;re getting working</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="4.29">papers as soon as they enter the country</text>
  <text start="348.89" dur="5.32">because they believe that if they do</text>
  <text start="351" dur="5.1">this this will prop up the economy but</text>
  <text start="354.21" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re not seeing the productivity</text>
  <text start="356.1" dur="5.1">portion of it and they&amp;#39;re scratching</text>
  <text start="358.56" dur="7.02">their head saying that part dropped off</text>
  <text start="361.2" dur="7.23">and they don&amp;#39;t understand why well we</text>
  <text start="365.58" dur="7.49">shipped all the real good jobs</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="8.55">especially the manufacturing overseas</text>
  <text start="373.07" dur="8.22">right now we are made up of bartenders</text>
  <text start="376.98" dur="7.56">waiters low-paying jobs or paper pushers</text>
  <text start="381.29" dur="5.53">there&amp;#39;s nothing being produced here in</text>
  <text start="384.54" dur="4.62">the United States yes there&amp;#39;s small</text>
  <text start="386.82" dur="7.05">pockets here and there but not like we</text>
  <text start="389.16" dur="9.48">were in the 50s and in the 60s not at</text>
  <text start="393.87" dur="7.2">all far from it and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="398.64" dur="7.11">normally productivity is opposed to</text>
  <text start="401.07" dur="6.81">increase by 2.2% but last year it only</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="6.57">increased by point seven percent and</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="6.87">this is declining every year so do we</text>
  <text start="412.32" dur="4.71">really believe the central bank really</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="5.4">doesn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s happening of course</text>
  <text start="417.03" dur="6.51">they do but they put out this propaganda</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="5.49">in their minutes to make everyone think</text>
  <text start="423.54" dur="6">like wow why is this not happen what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.64" dur="4.9">going on here they know exactly back in</text>
  <text start="429.54" dur="3.79">two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="430.54" dur="5.19">when the entire economy was going to</text>
  <text start="433.33" dur="6.15">crash they knew everything was not</text>
  <text start="435.73" dur="7.95">contained they lie this is what they do</text>
  <text start="439.48" dur="7.23">and they&amp;#39;re using these tactics to</text>
  <text start="443.68" dur="5.36">confuse everyone oh the population</text>
  <text start="446.71" dur="4.77">growth is there but we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="449.04" dur="4.06">productivity no they know exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.48" dur="4.56">going on but they don&amp;#39;t want to come out</text>
  <text start="453.1" dur="3.93">and say it because of course then people</text>
  <text start="456.04" dur="4.65">would be like wait what are you saying</text>
  <text start="457.03" dur="6.12">here we shipped all our jobs off and</text>
  <text start="460.69" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re doomed that&amp;#39;s exactly what is</text>
  <text start="463.15" dur="8.12">happening at this point we see</text>
  <text start="464.83" dur="10.41">economists in citibank the biz the UN</text>
